So the guidebook says...<br> that the route is through here<br> -but I know a better way.<br> The cool way.<br> Guaranteed, the best time you can have<br> with your clothes on.<br> Although,<br> it's better with your clothes off.<br> It is a bit of a climb.<br> - We climb.<br> And a bit of a squeeze.<br> - We squeeze.<br> So you get us all the way here<br> and then you tell us you're not a guide ...<br> Well no, I'm an engineer.<br> But this is what<br> I really want to do.<br> Wonderful.
