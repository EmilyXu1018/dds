                        You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.<br> You did it. You did it!<br> To continue, you've listened to a long and<br> complex case, murder in the first degree.<br> Premeditated murder is the most serious<br> charge tried in our criminal courts.<br> You've listened to the testimony, had the<br> law interpreted as it applies in this case.<br> It's now your duty to sit down and try<br> and separate the facts from the fancy.<br> One man is dead.<br> Another man's life is at stake.<br> If there's a reasonable doubt in your<br> minds as to the guilt of the accused -<br> a reasonable doubt-then you must<br> bring me a verdict of not guilty.<br> If there's no reasonable doubt,<br> then you must, in good conscience,<br> find the accused guilty.<br> However you decide,<br> your verdict must be unanimous.<br> In the event that<br> you find the accused guilty,<br> the bench will not entertain<br> a recommendation for mercy.<br> The death sentence is mandatory<br> in this case.<br> You are faced with a grave responsibility.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> The alternate jurors are excused.<br> The jury will now retire.<br> - Wanna piece of gum?<br> - No, thanks.<br> This thing isn't movin'.<br> - I'll give you a hand.<br> - That's it.<br> You know somethin'? I called<br> the Weather Bureau this morning.<br> This is gonna be<br> the hottest day of the year.<br> You'd think they'd air-condition this place.<br> - What is your name, sir?<br> - Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.<br> Thank you very much.<br> OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.<br> Now, if there's anything you want,<br> I'll be right outside the door. Just knock.<br> Good morning.<br> I never knew they locked the door.<br> Sure they lock the door.<br> What'd you think?<br> I don't know. It just never occurred to me.<br> - What's that for?<br> - I thought we might wanna vote by ballot.<br> Great idea. Maybe we can<br> get him elected senator.<br> - How'd you like it?<br> - I don't know. It was pretty interesting.<br> - Yeah? I almost fell asleep.<br> - I mean, I've never been on a jury before.<br> No? I've sat on many juries.<br> Those lawyers talk and talk, even when<br> it's an open-and-shut case like this one.<br> - Ever hear so much talk about nothin'?<br> - I guess they're entitled.<br> They're entitled. It's the system, but...<br> if you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids<br> down before they start any trouble.<br> It saves a lot of time and money.<br> Let's get started.<br> Yeah. We've probably all<br> got things to do here.<br> We can start with a five-minute break.<br> One gentleman is in the bathroom.<br> Are... we gonna sit in order?<br> Gee, I don't know. I guess so.<br> - Buddy, you're in my seat.<br> - Oh, excuse me.<br> That's all right.<br> Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?<br> What did you think of the case?<br> I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.<br> No real... dead spots.<br> You know what I mean?<br> We were lucky to get a murder case.<br> I figured us for an assault or burglary.<br> Boy, they can be the dullest!<br> - Hey, is that the Woolworth Building?<br> - That's right.<br> Isn't that funny? I've lived here all my life.<br> I've never been inside it.<br> If you had to sort out all that junk,<br> like that thing with the movies.<br> Yeah. What about<br> that business with the knife?<br> Asking grown-up people<br> to believe that kind of jazz.<br> You expect that.<br> You know what we're dealing with.<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> Well, your horn works.<br> Now try your lights.<br> - You got a cold?<br> - And how. Hot-weather colds can kill you.<br> I can hardly touch my nose.<br> Know what I mean?<br> Sure do. I just got over one.<br> - Oh, come on! Mr Foreman, let's go.<br> - The guy's still in the bathroom.<br> What's new? I didn't get a chance<br> to see a paper this morning.<br> I was only wondering<br> how the market closed.<br> - You got a seat on the exchange?<br> - I'm a broker.<br> I run a messenger service.<br> The Beck and Call Company.<br> The name is my wife's idea.<br> Got 37 men workin'. Started with nothin'.<br> OK, men. Let's take our seats, huh?<br> We can all get out of here pretty quick.<br> I have tickets to that ball game tonight.<br> Yanks and Cleveland. We've got<br> this kid Modjelewski in there.<br> He's a real bull, this kid. You know...<br> Real jug-handled. You know?<br> You're a real baseball fan, aren't ya?<br> Where do we sit here?<br> I thought we'd sit in order,<br> by jury numbers.<br> One, two, three and so on around the<br> table, if that's OK with you gentlemen.<br> - What's the difference?<br> - It's reasonable to sit in order.<br> - Let it be.<br> - That's twelve. We go around one, two...<br> What was your impression<br> of the prosecuting attorney?<br> - I beg pardon?<br> - I thought he was really sharp,<br> the way he handled all those points<br> one by one, in logical sequence.<br> - I was very impressed.<br> - I think he... he did an expert job.<br> A lot of drive, too. You know? Real drive.<br> OK, fellas. Can we<br> hold it down a minute? Fellas?<br> Say, we'd like to get started.<br> Gentleman at the window.<br> - We'd like to get started.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - The kid kills his father, just like that.<br> - Listen, it happens all the time.<br> They let those kids run wild up there.<br> Well, maybe it serves him right.<br> You know what I mean?<br> - Is everyone here?<br> - The old man is inside.<br> - Would you knock on the door for him?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you a Yankee fan?<br> - No, Baltimore.<br> Baltimore?<br> That's like being hit in the head<br> with a crowbar once a day.<br> Who have they got? Who have they got<br> besides good groundkeepers?<br> - Say, we'd like to get started.<br> - Forgive me, gentlemen.<br> - I didn't mean to keep you waiting.<br> - Baltimore?<br> OK, if I can have your attention. You fellas<br> can handle this thing any way you want.<br> I'm... you know,<br> I'm not gonna make any rules.<br> We can, well, discuss it first, then vote<br> on it. That's, of course... that's one way.<br> And, well, we can vote on it right now.<br> I think it's customary<br> to take a preliminary vote.<br> Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?<br> Maybe we can all get outta here.<br> OK. Then I think that you know that we<br> have a first-degree murder charge here,<br> and if we vote the accused guilty,<br> we've got to send him to the chair.<br> Um... That's mandatory.<br> - I think we know that.<br> - Yeah, let's see who's where.<br> - OK. Anyone doesn't wanna vote?<br> - It's fine with me.<br> OK, then, just remember that this<br> has to be twelve to nothing, either way.<br> That's the law. OK, are we ready?<br> All those voting guilty,<br> please raise your hands.<br> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...<br> eight, nine, ten, eleven.<br> OK, that's eleven guilty.<br> Those voting not guilty?<br> One. Right.<br> Eleven guilty, one not guilty.<br> Well, now we know where we are.<br> Boy, oh boy! There's always one.<br> So, what do we do now?<br> - I guess we talk.<br> - Boy, oh boy!<br> You really think he's innocent?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You sat in court with the rest of us.<br> You heard what we did.<br> The kid's a dangerous killer.<br> - He's 18 years old.<br> - Well, that's old enough.<br> He stabbed his own father<br> four inches into the chest.<br> They proved it<br> a dozen different ways in court.<br> - Would you like me to list 'em for you?<br> - No.<br> - Then what do you want?<br> - I just want to talk.<br> What's there to talk about?<br> Eleven of us think he's guilty.<br> No one had to think about it twice<br> except you.<br> I want to ask you something.<br> Do you believe his story?<br> - I don't know. Maybe I don't.<br> - So how come you voted not guilty?<br> There were eleven votes for guilty.<br> It's not easy to raise my hand and send a<br> boy off to die without talking about it first.<br> - Well, now, who says it's easy?<br> - No one.<br> What? Just because I voted fast?<br> I honestly think the guy is guilty.<br> Couldn't change my mind<br> if you talked for 100 years.<br> I'm not trying to change your mind.<br> It's just that...<br> This is somebody's life.<br> We can't decide in five minutes.<br> - Supposing we're wrong?<br> - Supposing this building fell on my head?<br> - You can suppose anything.<br> - That's right.<br> What's the difference how long it takes?<br> Supposin' we take five minutes? So what?<br> Let's take an hour. The ball game<br> doesn't start till eight o'clock.<br> - Who's got something to say?<br> - /'m willing to sit for an hour.<br> - Great. I heard a good story last night...<br> - That's not why we're sitting here.<br> All right, then you tell me.<br> What are we sitting here for?<br> I don't know. Maybe no reason.<br> Look, this kid's been<br> kicked around all of his life.<br> You know, born in a slum,<br> mother dead since he was nine.<br> He lived for a year and a half<br> in an orphanage<br> when his father was serving<br> a jail term for forgery.<br> That's not a very happy beginning.<br> He's a wild, angry kid. That's all<br> he's ever been. And you know why?<br> Cos he's been hit on the head<br> by somebody once a day, every day.<br> He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.<br> I think we owe him a few words, that's all.<br> I don't mind telling you this, mister. We<br> don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial.<br> What do you think that trial cost?<br> He's lucky he got it. Know what I mean?<br> Look, we're all grown-ups in here.<br> We heard the facts, didn't we?<br> You're not gonna tell me we're supposed<br> to believe this kid, knowing what he is.<br> I've lived among them all my life.<br> You can't believe a word they say.<br> You know that. I mean, they're born liars.<br> - Only an ignorant man can believe that.<br> - Now, listen...<br> Do you think you were born<br> with a monopoly on the truth?<br> Certain things should be<br> pointed out to this man.<br> - It's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.<br> - We have a job to do. Now let's do it.<br> Rice Pops. It's a product<br> I work on at the agency.<br> "The breakfast with the built-in bounce."<br> - I wrote that line.<br> - Very catchy.<br> - Say, do you mind?<br> - I'm sorry. I have this habit of doodling.<br> - It keeps me thinking clearly.<br> - We have work to do.<br> There's no point<br> staying here for ever. OK.<br> Perhaps if the gentleman down there who<br> is disagreeing with us could tell us why.<br> Tell us what you're thinking. We might be<br> able to show you where you're mixed up.<br> Maybe this is an idea. It seems to me that<br> it's up to us to convince this gentleman<br> that he's wrong and we're right. Maybe if<br> we each took a couple of minutes just to...<br> - Well, it was just a quick idea.<br> - No, no, no. That's a good one.<br> Supposing we go once around the table?<br> I guess you're first.<br> It's hard to put into words.<br> I just think he's guilty.<br> I thought it was obvious from the word go.<br> Nobody proved otherwise.<br> Nobody has to prove otherwise.<br> The burden of proof's on the prosecution.<br> The defendant doesn't even have to open<br> his mouth. That's in the Constitution.<br> Sure, I know that. What I meant was...<br> Well... I just think he's guilty.<br> I mean, somebody saw him do it.<br> OK. Here's what I think. And I have<br> no personal feelings about this.<br> I just wanna talk about facts.<br> Number one.<br> The old man lived downstairs under<br> the room where the killing took place.<br> At 10 minutes after 12 on the night<br> of the killing, he heard loud noises.<br> Said it sounded like a fight.<br> And he heard the kid yell out<br> "I'm gonna kill ya."<br> A second later,<br> he heard a body hit the floor.<br> Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid<br> run down the stairs and out of the house.<br> Called the police. They found the old man<br> with the knife in his chest.<br> The coroner fixed the time of death<br> around midnight.<br> Now, these are facts.<br> You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.<br> I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.<br> I know he's only 18.<br> - But he's still gotta pay for what he did.<br> - I'm with you.<br> - OK. Are you finished?<br> - Yeah.<br> It is obvious to me that<br> the boy's entire story was flimsy.<br> He claimed he was at the movies,<br> yet he couldn't remember the names<br> of the films he saw or who played in them.<br> - That's right.<br> - And no one saw him at the theatre.<br> And the woman across the street-if her<br> testimony don't prove it, nothing does.<br> - That's right. She actually saw the killing.<br> - Fellas, please. Let's go in order.<br> Just a minute. Here's a woman...<br> Here's a woman who's lying in bed.<br> She can't sleep. She's dyin' with the heat.<br> She looks out the window,<br> and right across the street<br> she sees the kid stick the knife<br> into his father.<br> The time is 12.10 on the nose.<br> Everything fits.<br> She's known the kid all his life.<br> His window is opposite hers across the<br> el tracks. She swore she saw him do it.<br> Through the windows<br> of a passing el train.<br> This el train had no passengers on it.<br> It was just being moved downtown.<br> The lights were out,<br> and they proved in court that at night<br> you can look through the windows and<br> see what's happening on the other side.<br> - They proved it.<br> - I'd like to ask you something.<br> You don't believe the boy.<br> How come you believe the woman?<br> She's one of "them" too, isn't she?<br> - You're a pretty smart fella, aren't ya?<br> - OK, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen.<br> - Come on, sit down. Sit down.<br> - What's he so wise about? I'm telling ya...<br> Come on. Now we're not gonna<br> get anywhere fighting.<br> - Whose turn is it next?<br> - Oh, his. Number five.<br> May I... Can I pass?<br> Well... That's your privilege.<br> How about the next gentleman?<br> Oh. Well... I don't know.<br> I started to be convinced,<br> you know, very early in the case.<br> You see, I was looking for a motive.<br> That's very important because if you don't<br> have a motive, where's your case, right?<br> Anyway, that testimony from those people<br> across the hall from the kid's apartment,<br> that was very powerful. Didn't they say<br> something about a fight, an argument,<br> between the old man and his son<br> around about seven o'clock that night?<br> - I could be wrong but...<br> - It was eight o'clock, not seven.<br> They heard an argument. Then<br> they heard the father hit the boy twice.<br> Finally they saw the boy run, angry,<br> out of the house. What does that prove?<br> It don't prove anything.<br> It's just part of the picture.<br> You said it provided a motive.<br> So did the prosecution.<br> That wasn't a very strong motive.<br> This boy has been hit so many times<br> that violence is practically...<br> It's a normal state of affairs with him.<br> I just can't see two slaps in the face<br> provoking him into committing murder.<br> It may have been two too many.<br> Everyone has a breaking point.<br> Anything else?<br> - No.<br> - OK. How about you?<br> I don't know. It's all been said.<br> You can talk here for ever.<br> It's still the same thing.<br> This kid is five for 0.<br> Well, look at his record.<br> When he was 10, he was in children's<br> court: He threw a rock at a teacher.<br> When he was 15, he was<br> in reform school: He stole a car.<br> He's been arrested for muggin'.<br> He was picked up twice for knife fightin'.<br> They say he's real handy with a knife.<br> Oh, this is a very fine boy.<br> Ever since he was five, his father<br> beat him up regularly. He used his fists.<br> So would I. A kid like that?<br> It's these kids -<br> the way they are nowadays.<br> When I was a kid,<br> I used to call my father "sir".<br> That's right. Ever hear a kid<br> call his father that any more?<br> Fathers don't seem to think<br> it's important any more.<br> - You got any kids?<br> - Three.<br> I got one.<br> He's 22 years old.<br> When he was nine years old,<br> he ran away from a fight.<br> I saw it. I was so embarrassed,<br> I almost threw up.<br> I said "I'm gonna make a man out of you<br> if I have to break you in two tryin'."<br> Well, I made a man out of him.<br> When he was 16, we had a fight.<br> Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.<br> I haven't seen him for two years.<br> Kids.<br> You work your heart out...<br> - Well, let's get goin'.<br> - I think we're missing the point.<br> This boy's the product of a broken home<br> and a filthy neighbourhood.<br> We can't help that. We're here<br> to decide his innocence or guilt,<br> not to go into the reasons<br> why he grew up the way he did.<br> He was born in a slum.<br> Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.<br> It's no secret that children from slums<br> are potential menaces to society. I think...<br> You can say that again. The kids who<br> crawl out of these places are real trash.<br> - I don't want any part of them.<br> - Listen, I... I've lived in a slum all my life.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Please. I...<br> I've played in back yards<br> that were filled with garbage.<br> - Maybe you can still smell it on me.<br> - Listen, sonny...<br> Come on, now. There's nothing personal.<br> Come on, fella. He didn't mean you.<br> Let's not be so sensitive.<br> This sensitivity I can understand.<br> OK, look. Let's stop the arguing.<br> We're only wasting time.<br> Your turn down there. Let's go.<br> I didn't expect a turn. I thought<br> you were all gonna to try to convince me.<br> - That was the idea.<br> - I forgot. He's right.<br> He's the one keeping us in here.<br> Let's hear what he's got to say.<br> Wait. We decided to do this a certain way.<br> I think we ought to stick to it.<br> Oh, stop being a kid, will ya?<br> - What do you mean, a kid?<br> - What do you think I mean? K-I-D: Kid.<br> Just because I'm trying<br> to keep this organised?<br> Here, you take on the responsibility.<br> I'll just keep my mouth shut.<br> - Why are you gettin' so hot? Calm down.<br> - Don't tell me to calm down.<br> You want to take the chair?<br> Take the chair.<br> Did you ever see such a thing?<br> - You think it's funny?<br> - Forget it, fella. It's unimportant.<br> Unimportant? Here, you try it.<br> Nobody wants to change.<br> You're doing a beautiful job.<br> Yeah, you're doin' great. Just great, fella.<br> You stay in there and pitch.<br> All right, let's hear from somebody.<br> Well, if you want me to tell you<br> how I feel about it, it's all right with me.<br> - Boy, I don't care what you do.<br> - All right. I don't have anything brilliant.<br> I only know as much as you do.<br> According to the testimony,<br> the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.<br> I sat there in court for six days<br> listening while the evidence built up.<br> Everybody sounded so positive.<br> I began to get a peculiar feeling about<br> this trial. I mean, nothing is that positive.<br> There are questions I'd have liked to ask.<br> Maybe they wouldn't mean anything but...<br> I felt that the defence wasn't conducting<br> a thorough enough cross-examination.<br> He let too many things go by-little things.<br> What little things?<br> When they don't ask questions,<br> it's because they know<br> the answers already.<br> It's also possible for a lawyer to be just<br> plain stupid, isn't it? I mean, it's possible.<br> You sound like you met<br> my brother-in-law once.<br> I kept putting myself in the kid's place.<br> I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.<br> I mean, if I was on trial for my life,<br> I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution<br> witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.<br> Look, there was one alleged<br> eyewitness to this killing.<br> Someone else claims he heard the killing,<br> saw the boy run out after,<br> and there was circumstantial evidence.<br> But those two witnesses<br> were the entire case for the prosecution.<br> Supposing they're wrong?<br> What do you mean? What's the point<br> of having witnesses at all?<br> - Could they be wrong?<br> - Those people were under oath.<br> They're only people. People<br> make mistakes. Could they be wrong?<br> - Well, no. I don't think so.<br> - Do you know so?<br> Nobody can know a thing like that.<br> This isn't an exact science.<br> That's right, it isn't.<br> OK, let's get to the point.<br> What about the switch knife<br> they found in the old man's chest?<br> Some people haven't talked yet.<br> Shouldn't we go in order?<br> They'll get a chance to talk.<br> Be quiet a second, will ya?<br> What about the knife this fine, upright boy<br> admitted buying the night of the killing?<br> - Let's talk about it.<br> - All right. Let's get it in here and look at it.<br> - I'd like to see it again. Mr Foreman?<br> - Why do we have to see it again?<br> The gentleman has a right<br> to see exhibits in evidence.<br> - Say, could you bring us the knife?<br> - The knife? Sure.<br> The knife and the way it was bought<br> is strong evidence, don't you think?<br> - I do.<br> - Good. Let's take the facts one at a time.<br> One: The boy admitted leaving the house<br> at eight o'clock at night<br> after being slapped by his father.<br> No, he didn't say "slapped".<br> He said "punched". There's a difference.<br> After being hit several times by his father.<br> Two: He went directly to a local junk shop<br> where he bought one of those...<br> - Switch knives.<br> - Switchblade knives.<br> This wasn't an ordinary knife. It had<br> a very unusual carved handle and blade.<br> The storekeeper said it was the only one<br> of its kind he had ever had in stock.<br> Three: He met some friends of his in front<br> of a tavern about 8.45. Am I right so far?<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - You bet he is.<br> He talked with his friends<br> for an hour, leaving them at 9.45.<br> During this time,<br> they saw the switch knife.<br> Four: They identified the death weapon<br> in court as that very same knife.<br> Five: He arrived home<br> at about ten o'clock.<br> This is where the stories offered<br> by the State and the boy diverge slightly.<br> He claims that he went to a movie<br> at about 11.30,<br> returning home at 3.10 to find<br> his father dead and himself arrested.<br> He also claims that the two detectives<br> threw him down a half a flight of stairs.<br> What happened to the knife? He claims<br> it fell through a hole in his pocket<br> on the way to the movies,<br> sometime between 11.30 and 3.10,<br> and that he never saw it again.<br> Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.<br> I think it's clear the boy<br> never went to the movies that night.<br> No one in the house saw him go out.<br> No one at the theatre identified him.<br> He couldn't even remember<br> the names of the pictures he saw.<br> What actually happened is this.<br> The boy stayed home,<br> had another fight with his father,<br> stabbed him to death and left the house<br> at 10 minutes after 12.<br> He even wiped the knife<br> clean of fingerprints.<br> Are you trying to tell me that this knife<br> fell through a hole in the boy's pocket,<br> someone picked it up,<br> went to the boy's house<br> and stabbed his father with it<br> just to test its sharpness?<br> No, but it's possib/e the boy lost his knife<br> and somebody else stabbed his father<br> with a similar knife.<br> Take a look at this knife.<br> It's a very unusual knife.<br> I've never seen one like it. Neither had<br> the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.<br> Aren't you asking us to accept<br> an incredible coincidence?<br> - I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.<br> - And I say it's not possible.<br> Where did that come from?<br> - It's the same knife!<br> - What do you think you're doin'?<br> - Where did you get it?<br> - I went out walking last night.<br> Through the boy's neighbourhood.<br> I bought that at a pawn shop two blocks<br> from the boy's house. It cost six dollars.<br> It's against the law<br> to buy or sell switchblade knives.<br> - That's right. I broke the law.<br> - You pulled a real bright trick.<br> Now supposing you tell me what it proves.<br> - Maybe there are ten knives like that.<br> - Maybe there are!<br> What does it mean? You found a knife like<br> it. What's that? The discovery of the age?<br> You think somebody else did the stabbing<br> with exactly the same kind of knife?<br> - The odds are a million to one.<br> - It's possible!<br> - But not very probable.<br> - OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.<br> There's no point standing around<br> all over the place.<br> It's interesting that he'd find a knife<br> exactly like the boy's.<br> - What's interesting about it? Interesting!<br> - I just thought it was interesting.<br> Eleven of us still think he's guilty.<br> Right. You're not gonna<br> change anybody's mind.<br> If you wanna hang this jury, go ahead.<br> The kid'll be tried again<br> and found guilty, as sure as he's born.<br> You're probably right.<br> So, what are you gonna do?<br> We can be here all night.<br> It's only one night. A boy may die.<br> Well, why don't we just<br> set up house here?<br> Someone send for a pinochle deck<br> and we'll just sweat<br> the whole thing out right here.<br> - I don't think he oughta joke about it.<br> - What do you want me to do about it?<br> I don't see what the knife<br> has got to do with anything.<br> Somebody saw the kid stab his father.<br> What more do we need?<br> You guys can talk the ears<br> right off my head.<br> I got three garages going to pot.<br> So let's get done and get outta here.<br> The knife was important to the<br> district attorney. He spent a day...<br> He's a 15th assistant or something.<br> What does he know?<br> Let's hold it down. These side arguments<br> are only slowin' us up.<br> - Well, what about it?<br> - You're the only one.<br> I have a proposition to make to all of you.<br> I'm going to call for another vote.<br> I want you eleven men to...<br> vote by secret written ballot.<br> I'll abstain. If there are eleven votes<br> for guilty, I won't stand alone.<br> We'll take in a guilty verdict<br> to the judge right now.<br> But if anyone votes not guilty,<br> we'll stay here and talk it out.<br> - That's it. If you want to try it, I'm ready.<br> - All right. Let's do it the hard way.<br> That sounds fair. Everyone agreed?<br> Anyone doesn't agree?<br> OK, pass these along.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> Not guilty.<br> Guilty.<br> - Boy, how do you like that?<br> - And another chap flips his wings!<br> All right. Who was it?<br> Come on, I wanna know.<br> Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.<br> We all agreed on that, no?<br> If the gentleman<br> wants it to remain secret...<br> Secret? What do you mean? There are no<br> secrets in a jury room. I know who it was.<br> Brother, you really are somethin'.<br> You vote guilty like the rest of us,<br> then some golden-voiced preacher<br> tears your heart out -<br> some underprivileged kid<br> couldn't help becoming a murderer -<br> and you change your vote.<br> If that isn't the most sickening...<br> Why don't you drop a quarter<br> in his collection box?<br> Oh, now just wait a... Listen, you can't talk<br> to me like that. Who do you think you are?<br> Calm down, calm down. It doesn't matter.<br> - He's very excitable. Sit down.<br> - Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!<br> We're tryin' to put a guilty man<br> in the chair, where he belongs.<br> Someone starts tellin' us<br> fairy tales and we're listenin'!<br> - What made you change your vote?<br> - He didn't change his vote. I did.<br> - Oh, fine.<br> - I knew it.<br> - Would you like me to tell you why?<br> - No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.<br> - I'd like to anyway, if you don't mind.<br> - Do we have to listen to this?<br> - The man wants to talk.<br> - Thank you.<br> This gentleman has been<br> standing alone against us.<br> He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.<br> He just isn't sure. It's not easy to stand<br> alone against the ridicule of others.<br> So he gambled for support and I gave it<br> to him. I respect his motives.<br> The boy on trial is probably guilty,<br> but... I want to hear more.<br> The vote is ten to two. I'm talking!<br> You have no right to leave this room!<br> He can't hear you. He never will.<br> Let's sit down.<br> - Shall we continue?<br> - Well, I think we ought to take a break.<br> You know, one man's inside and<br> I think we ought to wait for him.<br> Looks like we're really<br> hung up here, huh?<br> I mean, that thing with the old man,<br> that was pretty unexpected.<br> Wish I could figure out some way<br> we could break it up.<br> You know, in advertising...<br> I told you I worked in an agency?<br> Some pretty strange people work there.<br> Well, not strange, really.<br> I guess it's just they have peculiar ways<br> of expressing themselves.<br> I suppose it's the same<br> in your business too, huh?<br> - What do you do?<br> - I'm a watchmaker.<br> Really? I imagine the finest watchmakers<br> in the world come from Europe.<br> Anyway, in an agency,<br> when we reach a point like this...<br> I'm telling him, in an ad agency when<br> a point like this is reached in a meeting,<br> there's always some character<br> ready with an idea, see.<br> It kills me. It's the weirdest thing,<br> the way they sometimes precede<br> their idea with a phrase.<br> Like, some account exec<br> will get up and he'll say:<br> "OK, here's an idea. Let's... run it up<br> the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it."<br> I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.<br> I... got a little excited back there.<br> I... didn't mean to get nasty.<br> Glad you're not one of those who lets<br> these emotional appeals influence him.<br> I don't know what's the matter<br> with that fan.<br> - Are you a salesman?<br> - I'm an architect.<br> You know what the soft sell is?<br> Well, you've got it, believe me.<br> I've got a different technique.<br> Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?<br> Yeah.<br> Hit 'em where they live-that's my motto.<br> I made 27 grand last year<br> sellin' marmalade.<br> That's not bad. I mean, you know,<br> considerin' marmalade.<br> What are you gettin' out of this? Kicks?<br> Or did somebody bump you on the head<br> once and you haven't gotten over it?<br> - Maybe.<br> - You know, you do-gooders are all alike.<br> You're always blowin' your stacks<br> over some guy that fanned.<br> But what are you wastin' our time for?<br> Why don't you donate five dollars to the<br> cause? Maybe it'll make you feel better.<br> This kid is guilty, pal.<br> It's as plain as the nose on your face. So<br> why don't we stop wastin' our time here?<br> We're gonna all get sore throats<br> if we keep it up.<br> What difference does it make<br> if you get it here or at the ball game?<br> No difference, pal.<br> No difference at all.<br> - Nice bunch of guys, huh?<br> - They're about the same as anyone else.<br> Boy, what a murderous day.<br> - Do you think we'll be much longer?<br> - I don't know.<br> He's guilty for sure.<br> Not a doubt in the whole world.<br> We should've...<br> We should've been done already.<br> Oh, I don't mind, you know.<br> Beats workin'.<br> - You think he's not guilty, huh?<br> - I don't know. It's possible.<br> Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'<br> you've never been wronger in your life.<br> You're wastin' your time.<br> You ought to wrap it up.<br> Supposing you were the one<br> who was on trial?<br> Well, I'm not used to supposin'.<br> I'm just a workin' man.<br> My boss does the supposin'. But...<br> I'll try one.<br> Supposin' you talk us all out of this and...<br> the kid really did knife his father, huh?<br> Are you ready?<br> Sorry, blue eyes.<br> - Well, where else?<br> - OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.<br> - Looks like we'll be here for dinner.<br> - OK, now let's get down to business.<br> - Who wants to start?<br> - I will.<br> - OK, go.<br> - You, down there.<br> The old man who lived downstairs says<br> he heard the kid yell "I'm gonna kill ya."<br> A second later,<br> he heard the body hit the floor.<br> He ran to the door and saw the kid run out<br> of the house. What's that mean to you?<br> I wonder how clearly he heard<br> the boy's voice through the ceiling.<br> He didn't. The window was open. So was<br> the one upstairs. It was a hot night.<br> It was another apartment.<br> It's not easy to identify a shouting voice.<br> He identified it in court.<br> The lady across the street looked right in<br> the open window and saw the stabbing.<br> - Isn't that enough for you?<br> - No, it isn't.<br> Boy, how do you like this guy?<br> It's like talkin' into a dead phone.<br> She said she saw it through<br> the windows of a moving el train.<br> There were six cars on the train.<br> She saw it through the last two.<br> She remembered insignificant details.<br> How can you argue with that?<br> Has anybody here any idea<br> how long it would take an el...<br> This isn't a game.<br> Did you see him?<br> The nerve! The absolute nerve!<br> - Forget it. It's not important.<br> - This isn't a game?<br> - Who does he think he is?<br> - Forget it now.<br> Any idea how long it takes an el train<br> at medium speed to pass a given point?<br> - What has that to do with it?<br> - Guess.<br> - I wouldn't have any idea.<br> - What do you think?<br> - I don't know. Ten, twelve seconds?<br> - A pretty good guess. Anyone else?<br> - Sounds right to me.<br> - What's the guessing game for?<br> - What do you say?<br> - Ten seconds.<br> - All right. What are you getting at?<br> - This.<br> It takes a six-car el train<br> ten seconds to pass a given point.<br> Say the given point is the open window<br> of the room where the killing took place.<br> You can reach out<br> and almost touch the el tracks, right?<br> Now let me ask you this. Has anyone<br> here ever lived near the el tracks?<br> I just finished painting an apartment that<br> overlooked an el line. It took three days.<br> - What was it like? Noisy?<br> - Oh, brother! No matter. We were punchy.<br> I lived in an apartment<br> near the el line once.<br> When the window's open,<br> the train noise is almost unbearable.<br> - You can hardly hear yourself think.<br> - Will you get to the point?<br> I will. Now, let's take two pieces of<br> testimony and try to put them together.<br> First: The old man<br> in the apartment downstairs.<br> He says he heard the boy say<br> "I'm gonna kill you",<br> and a split second later<br> heard a body hit the floor.<br> - One second later.<br> - Right.<br> Second: The woman across the street<br> swore positively she looked<br> out of the window and saw the killing<br> through the last two cars<br> of a passing el train-the last two cars.<br> - What are you givin' us here?<br> - Now, just a minute.<br> We've agreed that it takes ten seconds<br> for a train to pass a given point.<br> Since the woman saw the killing<br> through the last two cars,<br> we can assume that the body hit<br> the floor just as the train went by.<br> Therefore, the train had been<br> roaring by the old man's window<br> a full ten seconds<br> before the body hit the floor.<br> The old man - "I'm gonna kill you",<br> body hitting the floor a second later -<br> would have had to hear the boy's words<br> with the el roaring past his nose!<br> - It's not possible he heard it.<br> - Of course he heard it.<br> - Do you think so?<br> - He said he yelled at the top of his voice.<br> He couldn't have identified the voice<br> with the el roaring by.<br> It was a matter of seconds!<br> Nobody can be that accurate.<br> Testimony that could put a boy into the<br> electric chair shou/d be that accurate.<br> - I don't think he could have heard it.<br> - Maybe he didn't, with all that el noise.<br> - What are you people talkin' about?<br> - It stands to reason he couldn't have.<br> - Why lie? What's he got to gain?<br> - Attention, maybe.<br> You keep comin' in with bright sayings.<br> Send 'em to a paper! They pay $3 apiece!<br> What are you talkin' to him like that for?<br> A guy who talks like that to an old man<br> really oughta get stepped on.<br> You oughta have more respect, mister.<br> You say stuff like that to him again...<br> I'm gonna lay you out.<br> You go ahead. You say anything you like.<br> Why do you think the old man might lie?<br> It was just that I looked at him<br> for a very long time.<br> The seam of his jacket was split,<br> under the shoulder.<br> Did you notice that?<br> I mean, to come into court like that.<br> He was a very old man in a torn jacket.<br> And he walked very slowly to the stand.<br> He was dragging his left leg<br> and trying to hide it,<br> because he was ashamed.<br> I think I know this man<br> better than anyone here.<br> This is a quiet, frightened,<br> insignificant old man who...<br> who has been nothing all his life.<br> Who has never had recognition<br> or his name in the newspapers.<br> Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.<br> Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.<br> Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -<br> to mean nothing.<br> A man like this needs to be quoted,<br> to be listened to.<br> To be quoted just once -<br> very important to him.<br> It would be so hard for him<br> to recede into the background.<br> Wait a minute. Are you tellin' us he'd lie<br> just so he could be important once?<br> No. He wouldn't really lie.<br> But perhaps he made himself believe<br> he heard those words<br> and recognised the boy's face.<br> That's the most fantastic story ever.<br> How can you make up a thing like that?<br> What do you know about it?<br> - Does anybody want a cough drop?<br> - I'll take one.<br> I still don't see how anybody<br> can think he's not guilty.<br> There's something else I'd like<br> to talk about for a minute. Thanks.<br> We've proved the old man couldn't have<br> heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."<br> - You didn't prove it at all!<br> - Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?<br> This phrase, how many times have<br> all of us used it? Probably thousands.<br> "I could kill you for that." "Junior, do that<br> again and I'll kill you." "Rocky, kill him."<br> - It doesn't mean we'd really kill anybody.<br> - The phrase was: "I'm gonna kill you."<br> The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.<br> Don't tell me he didn't mean it.<br> Anybody says it like that, they mean it!<br> Gee, I don't know.<br> I was arguing with the guy I work next to<br> at the bank a few weeks ago.<br> He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.<br> This guy is trying to make you<br> believe what isn't so!<br> The kid said he'd kill him and he did!<br> Do you really think the boy'd shout it out<br> so the whole neighbourhood could hear?<br> - He's much too bright for that.<br> - Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.<br> He don't even speak good English.<br> He doesn't even speak good English.<br> Mr Foreman, I'd like to<br> change my vote to not guilty.<br> - You what?<br> - You heard me.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yeah, I'm sure.<br> The vote is nine to three<br> in favour of guilty.<br> Well, if this isn't the livin' end!<br> What are you basin' it on?<br> Stories this guy made up?<br> You oughta write for one of those kooky<br> detective magazines, make a fortune.<br> For cryin' out loud, the kid's own lawyer<br> knew he didn't stand a chance.<br> Right from the beginning, his own<br> lawyer knew, and you could see it.<br> Boy, oh boy, I'm telling ya.<br> This guy here is really somethin'.<br> The kid had a lawyer, didn't he?<br> He presented his case, not you.<br> - How come you say so much?<br> - Lawyers aren't infallible.<br> - Baltimore, please.<br> - He was court-appointed.<br> - What's that supposed to mean?<br> - A lot.<br> He didn't want the case<br> or he resented being appointed.<br> It's the kind of case that brings no money,<br> no glory, not much chance of winning.<br> That's not a very promising<br> situation for a young lawyer.<br> He'd really have to believe in his client to<br> put up a good case. Obviously he didn't.<br> Of course he didn't.<br> Who the heck could?<br> Except maybe some guy's mother<br> or somebody.<br> Oh, look.<br> Will you look at the time? Come on.<br> Pardon me. I have made some notes here,<br> and I would like, please,<br> to say something.<br> I have been listening very carefully and...<br> it seems to me that this man<br> has some very good points to make.<br> From what was presented at the trial,<br> the boy looks guilty, on the surface.<br> - But maybe if we go deeper...<br> - Come on, will ya?<br> There is a question I would like to ask.<br> Let us assume that the boy<br> really did commit the murder.<br> Now, this happened<br> at 10 minutes after 12.<br> Now, how was he caught by the police?<br> He came back home...<br> at three o'clock or so,<br> and he was captured by two detectives<br> in the hallway of his house.<br> Now, my question is:<br> If he really had killed his father,<br> why would he come back home<br> three hours later?<br> Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?<br> He came home for his knife. It's not nice<br> to leave knives in people's chests.<br> Yeah, especially relatives'.<br> I don't see anything funny about it.<br> The boy knew the knife<br> could be identified.<br> - He had to get it before the police did.<br> - If he knew the knife could be identified,<br> why did he leave it there in the first place?<br> I think we can assume the boy ran out in a<br> state of panic, having just killed his father.<br> He calmed down and realised<br> he'd left his knife there.<br> This, then, depends<br> on your definition of panic.<br> He would have had to be calm enough to<br> wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife.<br> Now, where did this panic start<br> and where did it end?<br> You voted guilty. What side are you on?<br> I don't believe I have to be loyal<br> to one side or the other.<br> - I'm simply asking questions.<br> - This is just off the top of my head but...<br> If /'d done the stabbing, I'd take a chance<br> and go back for the knife.<br> I'll bet he figured<br> nobody'd seen him running out<br> and the body wouldn't be discovered<br> till the next day.<br> After all, it was the middle of the night.<br> He figured it'd be found the next day.<br> Pardon. This is my whole point.<br> The woman across the street testified<br> that the moment after she saw the killing,<br> that is, a moment after the train went by,<br> she screamed, and then went<br> to telephone the police.<br> Now, the boy certainly<br> must have heard the scream.<br> So he knew that<br> somebody saw something.<br> I just don't think<br> that he would have gone back.<br> Two things. One: He may not have heard<br> the scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud.<br> Two: If he did, he may not<br> have connected it with his own acts.<br> He lived in a neighbourhood<br> where screams were commonplace.<br> - There's your answer.<br> - Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.<br> Didn't hear the scream,<br> did run out in a panic,<br> calmed down later and came back for the<br> knife, risking being caught by the police.<br> Maybe those things happened,<br> but maybe they didn't.<br> There's enough doubt to wonder if he was<br> there at all at the time of the killing.<br> What do you mean? Didn't the old man<br> see him running out of the house?<br> He's twisting the facts.<br> Did or didn't the old man see the kid<br> running out of the house at 12.10?<br> - Well, did or didn't he?<br> - He says he did.<br> Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?<br> - Witnesses can make mistakes.<br> - Sure, when you want them to!<br> - Or when he wants them to!<br> - Keep the yelling down.<br> Maybe we need a little yelling. These<br> guys keep going off every which way.<br> Did hear the scream, didn't hear it -<br> what difference does it make?<br> You're talking about little details<br> and forgetting the important stuff.<br> - I call for another vote.<br> - I'm talking here!<br> Another vote called for.<br> Now let's take our seats.<br> I never saw so much time<br> spent on nothin'.<br> It only takes a second.<br> OK, I guess the fastest way is<br> to find out who's voting not guilty.<br> All those voting not guilty,<br> please raise your hands.<br> Still the same. One, two, three<br> not guilty. Nine guilty.<br> So now where are we? We can yakety-yak<br> till next Tuesday. Where's it getting us?<br> Pardon. I vote not guilty.<br> What are you talkin' about? I mean,<br> we're all goin' crazy in here or somethin'.<br> The kid is guilty.<br> Why don't you listen to the facts?<br> Tell them, will ya?<br> This is gettin' to be a joke.<br> The vote is eight to four in favour of guilty.<br> What is this?<br> Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week?<br> I want you to tell me why<br> you changed your vote. Give me reasons.<br> I don't have to defend my decision to you.<br> There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.<br> Reasonable doubt?<br> Nothing but words. Look at this.<br> The kid you just decided isn't guilty<br> was seen ramming this into his father!<br> - What about this, Mr Reasonable Doubt?<br> - That's not the knife, remember?<br> - Oh, brilliant!<br> - I'm tellin' you, this is the craziest.<br> I mean, what are we supposed to believe?<br> You're pullin' stories out of thin air.<br> A guy like this, if he's sittin' ringside<br> at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,<br> he'd be trying to tell you that...<br> Look. Now what about the old man?<br> Are we supposed to believe he didn't<br> see the kid tearin' down the steps<br> He's just sayin' so to be important, right?<br> - What's the point of it all?<br> - Hold it.<br> The Baltimore rooter is heard from again.<br> - And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits.<br> - Hold on a second. Look.<br> - Did the old man say he ran to the door?<br> - What's the difference?<br> - He got there, didn't he?<br> - He said he ran. At least I think he did.<br> I don't remember, but I don't see<br> how he could have run.<br> He said he went from his bedroom<br> to the front door. Isn't that enough?<br> - Where was the bedroom?<br> - Down the hall.<br> - Don't you remember that?<br> - No.<br> - I want to see a diagram of the apartment.<br> - Why don't we have him on trial again?<br> You're the only one<br> wants to see exhibits.<br> - I want to see this one, too.<br> - I'd like to stop wastin' time.<br> If we're gonna wade through<br> that nonsense about the body...<br> No, but I'd like to know if an old man<br> who drags one foot cos he had a stroke<br> can get from his bedroom<br> to his front door in 15 seconds.<br> - He said 20.<br> - He said 15.<br> - 20. What are you tryin' to distort?<br> - He said 15.<br> How does he know how long<br> He said 15. He was positive about it.<br> He was an old man! He was confused!<br> How could he be positive about anything?<br> I don't see what you're going to prove.<br> The man said he saw the boy running out.<br> Let's see if the details bear him out.<br> As the body hit the floor,<br> he said he heard footsteps upstairs,<br> running to the front door.<br> Heard the upstairs door open,<br> the footsteps start down.<br> He said he got to his own door in, at most,<br> - Maybe he didn't.<br> - The old man said he did.<br> You oughta be at<br> that hair-splitters' convention.<br> Why don't you stop<br> making smart remarks?<br> My friend, for your three dollars a day,<br> you have to listen to everything.<br> Here's the apartment. The old man's was<br> directly beneath and exactly the same.<br> Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living<br> room, kitchen, bathroom, hall, stairs.<br> The old man was in this bedroom here.<br> He says he crossed to the door,<br> walked down the hall, opened the door<br> just in time to see the boy<br> running down the stairs. Am I right?<br> That's the story, for the 19th time.<br> - 15 seconds after the body hit the floor.<br> - Correct.<br> Now, let's see. It was...<br> It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.<br> The hall is 43 feet.<br> He would have had to walk 12 feet,<br> open the bedroom door,<br> walk 43 feet down and open<br> the front door, all in 15 seconds.<br> - Could he have done it?<br> - Sure.<br> He walks slowly. He needed help<br> into the witness chair.<br> - You make it sound like a long walk.<br> - For an old man who had a stroke, it is.<br> - What are you doin'?<br> - I'm gonna try it.<br> What do you mean?<br> Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?<br> - Maybe he just didn't think of it.<br> - Do you think he's an idiot? It's obvious.<br> - Did you think of it?<br> - It don't matter. He didn't bring it up<br> because he knew it'd hurt his case.<br> Or because it would have meant bullying<br> and badgering a helpless old man.<br> That doesn't sit well with a jury.<br> Most lawyers avoid it.<br> - What kind of a bum is he?<br> - That's what I'm asking.<br> Pass me that chair.<br> Those two chairs are the old man's bed.<br> I just paced off 12 feet.<br> This is the bedroom door.<br> That's crazy.<br> You can't re-create a thing like that.<br> The hall was 43 feet.<br> I'll pace from that wall and back again.<br> This is insane. What are you<br> wasting everybody's time for?<br> According to you, it'll only take<br> Come on. Knock it off.<br> OK. OK, OK, killer.<br> Yeah.<br> Will you stand there and mark the front<br> door? It was chain-locked, remember.<br> - Who's got a watch with a second hand?<br> - I have.<br> Stamp your foot. That'll be the body<br> falling. You can time me from there.<br> - What are we gonna do, play charades?<br> - What are we waiting for?<br> I wanna wait till<br> the second hand reaches 60.<br> Aw, come on!<br> Come on, speed it up.<br> He can walk twice as fast as that.<br> If you want me to walk<br> faster than that, I will.<br> - Lock. Door. Stop.<br> - Right.<br> What's the time?<br> Exactly... 41 seconds.<br> This is what I think happened. The old<br> man heard the fight a few hours earlier.<br> When he's in bed,<br> he heard the body hit the floor,<br> heard the woman scream, got to<br> his front door as fast as he could,<br> heard somebody running<br> and assumed it was the boy.<br> - I think that's possible.<br> - Assumed?<br> Brother, I've seen all kinds<br> of dishonesty in my day,<br> but this little display takes the cake.<br> You all come in here with your hearts<br> bleedin' about slum kids and injustice.<br> You listen to some fairy tales. You start<br> getting through to these old ladies.<br> You're not getting through to me.<br> I've had enough.<br> What's the matter with you guys?<br> You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!<br> - He'll slip through our fingers.<br> - Slip through our fingers?<br> - Are you his executioner?<br> - I'm one of 'em.<br> - Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.<br> - For this kid, you bet I would.<br> I feel sorry for you. What it must<br> feel like to wanna pull the switch!<br> Ever since you walked in, you've acted<br> like a self-appointed public avenger.<br> You want to see this boy die because<br> you want it, not because of the facts.<br> - You're a sadist.<br> - You...<br> Let me go! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!<br> You don't really mean<br> you'll kill me, do you?<br> - Anything wrong? I heard some noise.<br> - No, everything's all right.<br> We're just... Friendly little argument.<br> We're through with that diagram.<br> You can take it if you want. Here you are.<br> What are you lookin' at?<br> - Somebody has to start off again.<br> - I beg pardon...<br> "I beg pardon."<br> What are you so polite about?<br> For the same reason you're not.<br> It's the way I was brought up.<br> This fighting... That's not<br> why we are here, to fight.<br> We have a responsibility.<br> This, I have always thought,<br> is a remarkable thing about democracy.<br> That we are...<br> What is the word?<br> Notified. That we are notified by mail<br> to come down to this place<br> to decide on the guilt or innocence of a<br> man we... we have never heard of before.<br> We have nothing to gain or lose<br> by... by our verdict.<br> This is one of the reasons<br> why we are strong.<br> We should not make it a... personal thing.<br> If nobody else has an idea,<br> I might have a cutie here.<br> Let's throw it out<br> and see if the cat licks it up.<br> - The cat licks it up?<br> - Yeah. The boy...<br> Look how dark it's gettin' out there.<br> I bet we're gonna have a storm now.<br> Boy, oh boy. It's really hot, huh?<br> - Pardon me, but... don't you ever sweat?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Listen. I... I was wonderin' if...<br> Maybe... maybe we should<br> take another vote.<br> Great. Maybe we can follow this one up<br> with a little dancing and refreshments!<br> - Mr Foreman?<br> - Well, that's OK with me.<br> Anyone doesn't wanna vote?<br> Hey, come on.<br> - Sorry.<br> - I think we ought to have an open ballot.<br> Call out our votes, you know?<br> Let's see who stands where.<br> Well, that sounds fair to me.<br> Anyone object?<br> OK. I'll call off your jury numbers. One?<br> Oh, that's me. I vote guilty. Two?<br> Not guilty.<br> Number three?<br> Guilty.<br> Number four?<br> Guilty.<br> Number five?<br> Not guilty.<br> Number six?<br> Not guilty.<br> Number seven?<br> Guilty.<br> Number eight?<br> Not guilty.<br> - Number nine?<br> - Not guilty.<br> - Number ten?<br> - Guilty.<br> Number eleven?<br> Not guilty.<br> Number twelve?<br> Number twelve!<br> Guilty.<br> The vote is now six to six.<br> And we go into extra innings here, eh?<br> Six to six! I'm telling you, some of you<br> people in here must be out of your minds.<br> A kid like that!<br> I don't think the kind of boy he is<br> has anything to do with it.<br> - Facts determine the case.<br> - Don't give me that!<br> I'm sick and tired of facts.<br> You can twist 'em any way you like.<br> That's exactly the point<br> this gentleman has been making.<br> You keep shouting<br> at the top of your lungs...<br> I'd like to be a few years younger.<br> That man gets on my...<br> - My, it's hot in here.<br> - Want a drink of water?<br> No, no. Thanks. Thanks.<br> - It's gonna rain.<br> - Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?<br> - How come you changed your vote?<br> - It just seemed there was room for doubt.<br> - You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br> - I don't feel that way.<br> - A lot of details never came out.<br> - Yeah, well, good luck.<br> Come on. You're like everybody else.<br> You think too much, you get mixed up.<br> - You know what I mean?<br> - I don't think you have any right to...<br> Loudmouth.<br> Look at that come down, will ya?<br> You know, this reminds me<br> of a storm we had last...<br> Was it November?<br> I don't know. Something.<br> It was quite a storm we had.<br> It was right in the middle of a game.<br> We were behind-seven to six. We'd just<br> started to move the ball, made a tackle.<br> It was gonna cut right in, slash through,<br> slashed right in, cut right through...<br> And...<br> We had this kid - Slattery.<br> He was an ox. A real ox.<br> I wish I had another one just like him.<br> I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head<br> coach at Andrew J McCorkle High School.<br> That's out in Queens.<br> And anyway... we're starting<br> to move along real nice.<br> You know, their whole line is just...<br> just comin' apart.<br> And it starts to come down,<br> cats and dogs, just like this.<br> Just... whoosh! You know, right down.<br> Well, it was murder, you know?<br> I swear, I... I nearly bawled.<br> Just... We couldn't go nowhere.<br> Hey, what is it with this fan here?<br> How come...<br> Must have been<br> on the same switch with the lights.<br> Well, things are lookin' up here, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Boy, that's better.<br> Hey! Two points.<br> You guys ever go to the Garden?<br> That's a damn stupid thing to do.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I...<br> You know?<br> Pardon me.<br> Well, how do you like it? Even-steven.<br> Pretty surprising, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> That... business before, when that tall guy,<br> whatshisname, was tryin' to bait me?<br> That doesn't prove anything.<br> I'm a... pretty excitable person.<br> Where does he come off<br> calling me a public avenger, a sadist?<br> Anyone in his right mind<br> would blow his stack.<br> He was just tryin' to bait me.<br> He did an excellent job.<br> I think we're going nowhere here.<br> I'm ready to walk into court<br> and declare a hung jury.<br> - There's no point in this thing going on.<br> - I go for that, too.<br> Let the kid take his chance<br> with 12 other guys.<br> The judge won't accept a hung jury.<br> We haven't been here long.<br> - Well, let's find out.<br> - I am not in favour of that.<br> This kid wouldn't stand a chance<br> with another jury, and you know it.<br> Come on, we're hung.<br> Nobody's gonna change his vote.<br> - Still no room for reasonable doubt?<br> - No.<br> Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand<br> the term "reasonable doubt".<br> What do you mean, I don't understand?<br> How do you like this guy?<br> I'm tellin' you, they're all alike.<br> They come over here<br> and before they can take a breath,<br> they're telling us how to run the show.<br> - Boy, the arrogance of this guy!<br> - All right.<br> Let's stop the arguing<br> for about two minutes in here.<br> Now, who's got<br> something constructive to say?<br> I'd like to go over something,<br> if you gentlemen don't mind.<br> An important point<br> for the prosecution was<br> the fact that after the boy claimed he was<br> at the movies when the killing took place,<br> he couldn't remember the names<br> of the movies or who starred in them.<br> - This gentleman has made that point.<br> - That's correct.<br> It's the only alibi the boy offered, and<br> he couldn't back it up with any details.<br> In the boy's place,<br> do you think you could remember details<br> after an upsetting experience<br> such as being slapped by your father?<br> I think so, if there were<br> any special details to remember.<br> The boy couldn't remember the movies<br> because he wasn't there.<br> According to the police testimony,<br> the boy was questioned in the kitchen,<br> while the body of his father<br> was lying in the bedroom.<br> Do you think<br> you could remember details?<br> - I do.<br> - Under great emotional stress?<br> - Under great emotional stress.<br> - He remembered them correctly in court.<br> Yes. His lawyer took great pains<br> to bring that out.<br> He had three months to the day of the trial<br> in which to memorise them.<br> It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out<br> what played on a particular night.<br> I'll take the testimony<br> from right after the murder,<br> when he couldn't remember a thing about<br> the movies, great emotional stress or not.<br> - I'd like to ask you a personal question.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Where were you last night?<br> - I was home all night.<br> - How about the night before that?<br> - What is this?<br> It's all right. I left the office at 8.30<br> and went straight home and to bed.<br> - And the night before that?<br> - That was... Tuesday night.<br> - The bridge tournament. I played bridge.<br> - Monday night?<br> When you get to<br> New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.<br> Monday night? Monday night...<br> my wife and I went to the movies.<br> - What did you see?<br> - The Scar/et Circ/e. A whodunit.<br> - What was the second feature?<br> - The...<br> I'll tell you in a minute. The...<br> Remarkab/e Mrs...<br> Something.<br> Mrs Bainbridge.<br> The Remarkab/e Mrs Bainbridge.<br> I saw that. It's called<br> The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.<br> Yes. The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.<br> Who was in<br> The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?<br> Barbara... Long, I think it was.<br> A dark, very pretty girl.<br> - Ling or... Long. Something like that.<br> - Who else?<br> I'd never heard of them before.<br> It was a very inexpensive<br> second feature, with unknown...<br> And you weren't under<br> an emotional stress, were you?<br> No.<br> I wasn't.<br> - I think the point is made.<br> - Big point.<br> You can talk till your tongue is<br> draggin' on the floor. The boy is guilty.<br> Know what I mean, my friend?<br> - You got those cough drops?<br> - They're all gone, my friend.<br> Oh, boy. Look at that rain.<br> There goes your ball game.<br> It's only a shower.<br> Besides, they got the infield covered.<br> Say, could I see that knife<br> a second, please?<br> Well, we're still tied up six to six.<br> Who's got a suggestion?<br> - It's 5 after 6. Let's get some dinner.<br> - Why don't we wait till 7 o'clock?<br> OK with me.<br> There's something I'd like to say.<br> It's been bothering me a little,<br> and as long as we're stuck...<br> There was this whole business about<br> the stab wound and how it was made.<br> - The downward angle of it, you know?<br> - Don't start with that again.<br> - They've been over it and over it.<br> - I know, but I don't go along with it.<br> The boy was five feet seven inches tall.<br> His father was six two.<br> That's a difference of seven inches.<br> It's very awkward to stab down into the<br> chest of someone over half a foot taller.<br> Give me that.<br> I'll give you a demonstration.<br> Somebody get up.<br> Watch this - I don't wanna<br> have to do it again.<br> I'll make myself about<br> six or seven inches shorter.<br> - That's about right. Maybe a little more.<br> - OK, a little more.<br> Now... nobody's hurt.<br> - Right?<br> - Right. Nobody hurt.<br> Now, this is the way I'd stab a man<br> who was... taller than I was.<br> Look at the angle. Down and in.<br> And this is the way it was done.<br> Now tell me I'm wrong.<br> - Down and in. There's no argument.<br> - Hold on a minute.<br> Will you give me that?<br> Boy, I hate these things.<br> - Did you ever see a knife fight?<br> - No.<br> Anybody here ever see a knife fight?<br> Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop,<br> the lot across the street, back yard.<br> Switchblades came<br> with the neighbourhood.<br> Funny I never thought of it before.<br> I guess you try to forget.<br> - How do you use a switchblade?<br> - Well, you'd never use it like this.<br> See, you'd lose too much time<br> switching hands.<br> Here's how. Underhand.<br> Anyone who's ever used one<br> wouldn't handle it any other way.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - I'm sure.<br> - It's why they're made to open like that.<br> - The boy was pretty handy with a knife?<br> You think he could have made<br> the wound that killed his father?<br> No. Not with the experience he got<br> all his life handling these things.<br> - I feel he'd have gone for him underhand.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Were you there when he was killed?<br> - No. Neither was anybody else.<br> What are you giving us this<br> mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.<br> I don't think you can tell<br> what wound he might have made<br> simply because he knew<br> how to handle a knife.<br> - What do you think?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What do you mean, you don't know?<br> - I don't know.<br> - How about you?<br> - I don't know about the rest of 'em,<br> but I'm gettin' tired of this<br> yakety-yakkin'. It's gettin' us nowhere.<br> So I guess /'// have to break it up.<br> I'm changin' my vote to not guilty.<br> - You're what?<br> - You heard me. I've had enough.<br> - You've had enough? That's no answer.<br> - Listen, you just take care of yourself.<br> - You know?<br> - He's right.<br> That's not an answer.<br> What kind of a man are you?<br> You have sat here and voted<br> guilty with everyone else<br> because there are some baseball tickets<br> burning a hole in your pocket.<br> Now you have changed your vote because<br> you say you're sick of all the talking?<br> - Now, listen, buddy...<br> - Who tells you that you have the right<br> to play like this with a man's life?<br> Don't you care...<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> You can't talk like that to me.<br> I can talk like that to you.<br> If you want to vote not guilty,<br> do it because you are convinced he is not<br> guilty, not because you've had enough.<br> And if you think he is guilty,<br> then vote that way.<br> Or don't you have the guts<br> to do what you think is right?<br> - Now, listen...<br> - Guilty or not guilty?<br> - I told you. Not guilty.<br> - Why?<br> - Look, I don't have to...<br> - You do have to. Say it. Why?<br> I... I don't think he's guilty.<br> - I want another vote.<br> - OK, that's another vote called for.<br> I guess the quickest way<br> is a show of hands. Anyone object?<br> OK, all those voting not guilty,<br> raise your hands.<br> One, two, three,<br> four, five, six, seven...<br> eight.<br> Nine.<br> All those voting guilty, raise your hands.<br> One, two, three.<br> Well, the vote's nine to three<br> in favour of acquittal.<br> I don't understand you people!<br> All these picky little points you keep<br> bringing up, they don't mean nothing!<br> You saw this kid just like I did.<br> Don't tell me you believe that<br> phoney story about losing the knife<br> and about being at the movies.<br> Look, you know how these people lie.<br> It's born in them.<br> What the heck? I don't have to tell you.<br> They don't know what the truth is!<br> And they don't need any real big reason<br> to kill someone, either.<br> No, sir. They get drunk.<br> They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.<br> You know that. And bang!<br> Someone's lying in the gutter.<br> Nobody's blaming 'em.<br> That's the way they are by nature.<br> You know what I mean? Violent.<br> Where are you going?<br> Human life don't mean<br> as much to them as it does to us.<br> They're lushing it up<br> and fighting all the time,<br> and if somebody gets killed,<br> somebody gets killed! They don't care!<br> Sure, there's some good things about 'em,<br> too. I'm the first one to say that.<br> I've known a couple who were OK,<br> but that's the exception.<br> Most of 'em, it's like they have<br> no feelings! They can do anything!<br> What's going on here?<br> I'm trying to tell you.<br> You're making a big mistake, you people.<br> This kid is a liar. I know it.<br> I know all about them.<br> Listen to me. They're no good.<br> There's not a one of 'em who's any good.<br> I mean, what's happening in here?<br> I speak my piece, and you...<br> Listen to me.<br> I... We're... we're...<br> This kid on trial here. His type.<br> Well, don't you know about them?<br> There's a... There's a danger here.<br> These people are dangerous.<br> They're... wild.<br> Listen to me. Listen to me.<br> I have. Now, sit down<br> and don't open your mouth again.<br> Some of the time... I tell you.<br> It's always difficult to keep personal<br> prejudice out of a thing like this.<br> Wherever you run into it,<br> prejudice always obscures the truth.<br> I don't really know what the truth is.<br> I don't suppose anybody<br> will ever really know.<br> Nine of us now seem to feel<br> that the defendant is innocent.<br> But we're just gambling on<br> probabilities. We may be wrong.<br> We may be trying to let a guilty man<br> go free. I don't know. Nobody really can.<br> But we have a reasonable doubt.<br> And that's something<br> that's very valuable in our system.<br> No jury can declare a man guilty<br> unless it's sure.<br> We nine can't understand<br> how you three are still so sure.<br> - Maybe you can tell us.<br> - I'll try.<br> You've made some excellent points,<br> but I still believe the boy is guilty.<br> I have two reasons. One: The evidence<br> given by the woman across the street,<br> who actually saw the murder committed.<br> That's the most important testimony.<br> And two: The fact that<br> she described the stabbing<br> by saying she saw the boy<br> raise his arm over his head<br> and stab down into the father's chest.<br> - She saw him do it, the wrong way.<br> - That's absolutely right.<br> Let's talk about this woman for a moment.<br> She said she went to bed<br> about eleven o'clock that night.<br> Her bed was next to the window,<br> and she could look out<br> and see directly into<br> the boy's room across the street.<br> She tossed and turned for over an hour.<br> Finally, she turned toward the window<br> at about 10 minutes after 12,<br> and as she looked out, she saw the killing<br> through the windows of a passing el train.<br> She said the lights went out<br> after the killing,<br> but that she got a good look at the boy<br> in the act of stabbing his father.<br> As far as I can see it,<br> this is unshakeable testimony.<br> - Well, that's the whole case.<br> - What do you think?<br> How about you?<br> I don't know. So much evidence to sift.<br> This is a pretty complicated business.<br> Frankly, I don't see how<br> you can vote for acquittal.<br> - It's not so easy to arrange the evidence.<br> - Throw out all the other evidence!<br> The woman saw him do it!<br> What else do you want?<br> - Well, maybe...<br> - Let's vote on it.<br> OK, there's another vote called for.<br> Anyone object?<br> All right. I'm changing my vote.<br> - He's guilty.<br> - Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.<br> Why is this such a personal triumph<br> for you, this one vote?<br> OK. I say we're a hung jury.<br> I say we take it in to the judge.<br> How about it? I wanna hear arguments.<br> You, you're the leader of the cause.<br> What about it?<br> - Let's go over it again.<br> - We've been over it again.<br> The boy in the grey flannel suit is<br> bouncin' back and forth like a tennis ball.<br> There's no point in getting nasty.<br> You keep trying to turn this into a contest.<br> OK.<br> Maybe we can talk about<br> setting some kind of time limit.<br> Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?<br> It's... a quarter after six. Someone<br> before mentioned seven o'clock.<br> That's a point at which we might begin to<br> discuss whether we're a hung jury or not.<br> - Don't you feel well?<br> - I feel perfectly well, thank you.<br> I was saying seven o'clock<br> would be a reasonable time...<br> The reason I asked that was because<br> you were rubbing your nose like...<br> Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting.<br> But you made a gesture<br> that reminded me of something.<br> - I'm trying to settle something here.<br> - Well, I think this is important.<br> Thank you. Now, then.<br> I'm sure you'll pardon me for this,<br> but I was wondering why<br> you rub your nose like that.<br> Come on, will you?<br> At this point I happen to be talking<br> to the gentleman sitting next to you.<br> Now, why were you<br> rubbing your nose like that?<br> If it's any of your business, I was<br> rubbing it because it bothers me a little.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. Is it...<br> Is it because of your eyeglasses?<br> It is. Now could we get on<br> to something else?<br> Your eyeglasses made those two deep<br> impressions on the sides of your nose.<br> I hadn't noticed that before.<br> That must be annoying.<br> It is very annoying.<br> I wouldn't know about that.<br> I've never worn eyeglasses. 20/20.<br> Listen, will you come on already<br> with the optometrist bit?<br> The woman who testified<br> that she saw the killing<br> had those same marks<br> on the sides of her nose.<br> Holy smoke! He's right.<br> Please. Just give me a minute...<br> and I'll be finished.<br> I don't know if anyone else<br> noticed that about her.<br> I didn't think of it then, but I've been<br> going over her face... in my mind.<br> She had those same marks.<br> She kept rubbing them in court.<br> He's right. She did do that a lot.<br> This woman was about 45 years old.<br> She was making<br> a tremendous effort to look 35.<br> For her first public appearance.<br> Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.<br> Brand-new clothes that should have<br> been worn by a younger woman.<br> No glasses. Well, women do that.<br> See if you can get a mental picture of her.<br> What do you mean, no glasses? How do<br> you know whether she wore glasses?<br> - Just cos she was rubbin' her nose?<br> - She had those marks. I saw 'em.<br> - So? What do you think that means?<br> - I'm sick of your yellin'...<br> Come on. Forget it.<br> Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. I saw<br> them too. I was the closest one to her.<br> She had these things<br> on the side of her nose.<br> What point are you makin'?<br> She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.<br> What does that mean?<br> Could those marks be made<br> by anything other than eyeglasses?<br> No. They couldn't.<br> I didn't see any marks!<br> I did. Strange,<br> but I didn't think about it before.<br> Why didn't the lawyer say something?<br> There are twelve people in here<br> concentrating on this case.<br> - Eleven of us didn't think of it either.<br> - What about the district attorney?<br> You think he'd pull that?<br> Have her testify without her glasses?<br> Ever see a woman who didn't want to<br> wear them because they spoil her looks?<br> OK. She had marks on her nose.<br> I'm givin' you that.<br> From glasses, right? She didn't<br> wanna wear 'em out of the house<br> so people'd think she's gorgeous.<br> But when she saw this kid killin'<br> his father, she was in the house alone.<br> That's all.<br> Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?<br> No. I don't.<br> No one wears eyeglasses to bed.<br> It's logical to assume<br> that she wasn't wearing them in bed.<br> - How do you know?<br> - I don't know. I'm guessing.<br> I'm also guessing that she didn't put them<br> on when she looked out of the window.<br> She testified the killing<br> took place just as she looked out.<br> The lights went off.<br> She didn't have time to put them on.<br> Here's another guess. She honestly<br> thought she saw the boy kill his father.<br> - I say she only saw a blur.<br> - How do you know what she saw?<br> How does he know all that? How<br> do you know what glasses she wore?<br> Maybe they were sunglasses! Maybe<br> she was far-sighted! What do you know?<br> I only know the woman's eyesight<br> is in question now.<br> She had to be able to identify a person<br> You can't send someone off<br> to die on evidence like that.<br> Aw, don't give me that.<br> - Might she not have made a mistake?<br> - No.<br> - It's not possible?<br> - No, it's not possible.<br> Is it possible?<br> Not guilty.<br> Do you think he's guilty?<br> I think he's guilty.<br> Do you?<br> No.<br> I'm convinced. Not guilty.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - I have a reasonable doubt now.<br> - It's eleven to one.<br> - What about all the other evidence?<br> What about all that stuff? The...<br> The knife? The whole business?<br> Well, you said we could<br> throw out all the other evidence.<br> Well, what do we do now?<br> You're alone.<br> I don't care whether I'm alone or not.<br> It's my right.<br> It's your right.<br> Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.<br> - We want to hear your arguments.<br> - I gave you my arguments.<br> We're not convinced.<br> We want to hear them again.<br> We have as much time as it takes.<br> Everything-every single thing that took<br> place in that courtroom says he's guilty.<br> What do you think?<br> I'm an idiot or somethin'?<br> Take that stuff about the old man,<br> who lived there and heard everything!<br> Or this business about the knife.<br> They found another one exactly like it?<br> The old man saw him!<br> Right there, on the stairs.<br> What's the difference<br> how many seconds it was?<br> Every single thing. The knife<br> fallin' through a hole in his pocket.<br> You can't prove he didn't get to the door!<br> Sure, you can take all the time, hobble<br> around the room, but you can't prove it!<br> And what about this business of the el?<br> And the movies?<br> There's a phoney deal if I ever heard one.<br> I'll bet you $5,000<br> /'d remember the movies I saw.<br> I'm tellin' you, everything that's gone on<br> has been twisted and turned!<br> This business with the glasses?<br> How do you know she didn't have 'em on?<br> This woman testified in open court!<br> And what about<br> hearin' the kid yell? Huh?<br> I'm tellin' ya, I've got all the facts here.<br> Here...<br> Well, that's it. That's the whole case.<br> Well?<br> Say something!<br> You lousy bunch of bleedin' hearts.<br> You're not gonna intimidate me.<br> I'm entitled to my opinion.<br> Rotten kids... You work your life out!<br> No...<br> Not guilty.<br> Not guilty.<br> We're ready now.<br> Hey!<br> - What's your name?<br> - Davis.<br> My name's McCardle.<br> - Well, so long.<br> - So long.<br>
