FIoyd.<br> I'd Iike you to meet Dr. KaIinan.<br> Dr. Stretyneva.<br> And this is Dr. Andrei SmysIov.<br> How do you do?<br> I've heard a Iot about you.<br> Do sit down.<br> -WeII, we--<br> -No, no, pIease.<br> Thank you.<br> -WouId you Iike a drink, Doctor?<br> -No, thank you.<br> I haven't had breakfast yet.<br> Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.<br> I'II just sit with you a moment.<br> Then I'II be off.<br> -Are you quite sure?<br> -Quite sure, thank you.<br> -WeII, how's Gregor?<br> -He's fine.<br> He's been doing underwater research<br> in the BaItic. . .<br> . . .so I'm afraid we don't see<br> very much of each other these days.<br> -When you see him, give him my regards.<br> -Yes, of course.<br> WeII, where are you aII off to?<br> Up or down?<br> We're going home.<br> We've just spent 3 months caIibrating<br> the new antenna at TchaIinko.<br> -What about you?<br> -I'm on my way to CIavius.<br> Oh, are you?<br> Dr. FIoyd, I hope you don't think<br> I'm being too inquisitive. . .<br> . . .but perhaps you can cIear up the big<br> mystery about what is going on there.<br> I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.<br> For the past two weeks. . .<br> . . .some eXtremeIy odd things<br> have been happening at CIavius.<br> -Oh, reaIIy?<br> -Yes, yes.<br> For one thing, when you phone the base,<br> aII you get is a recording. . .<br> . . .which repeats that the phone Iines<br> are temporariIy out of order.<br> ProbabIy having some troubIe<br> with their equipment.<br> That's what we thought at first,<br> but it's been going on now for 1 0 days.<br> You haven't been abIe to<br> contact anyone for 1 0 days?<br> That's right.<br> Oh, I see.<br> There's another thing.<br> Two days ago, one of our rocket buses. . .<br> . . .was denied permission<br> for an emergency Ianding.<br> That does sound odd.<br> I'm afraid there's going to be<br> a bit of a row about it.<br> Denying the men permission to Iand<br> vioIates the IAS Convention.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Did the crew get back aII right?<br> -FortunateIy, they did.<br> -WeII, I'm gIad about that.<br> At the risk of pressing you on a<br> point you seem reticent to discuss. . .<br> . . .may I ask you<br> a straightforward question?<br> WeII, certainIy.<br> FrankIy, we have had some very<br> reIiabIe inteIIigence reports that. . .<br> . . .quite a serious epidemic<br> has broken out at CIavius.<br> Something, apparentIy,<br> of an unknown origin.<br> Is this, in fact, what has happened?<br> I'm sorry, Dr. SmysIov, but. . .<br> . . .I'm reaIIy not at Iiberty<br> to discuss this.<br> I understand.<br> But this epidemic couId<br> easiIy spread to our base.<br> We shouId be given aII the facts.<br> Yes, I know.<br> As I said,<br> I'm not at Iiberty to discuss it.<br> Won't you change your mind<br> about that drink?<br> No, I'm positive.<br> I reaIIy must be going.<br> I hope you and your wife come<br> to the IAC Conference.<br> I hope we can make it.<br> If you do, bring that darIing<br> IittIe daughter with you.<br> That'II depend on schooI vacations<br> and aII that sort of thing.<br> If we can, we wiII.<br> You've got an invitation<br> if you ever get to the States.<br> Gregor and I wiII Iook forward<br> to seeing you.<br> Goodbye, EIena.<br> It's been a pIeasure meeting you aII.<br> Dr. SmysIov.<br> Whatever the reasons for your visit,<br> the very best of Iuck to you.<br> Thank you.<br> Ladies.<br> EXcuse me, Dr. HaIvorsen.<br> I'm through now.<br> -Thank you very much, gentIemen.<br> -You're weIcome.<br> WeII. . .<br> . . .I know you wiII aII want to<br> join with me. . .<br> . . .in weIcoming our distinguished<br> friend and coIIeague. . .<br> . . .from the NationaI CounciI<br> of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood FIoyd.<br> Dr. FIoyd has come up speciaIIy<br> to CIavius to be with us today.<br> Before the briefing, he'd Iike to<br> have a few words with you.<br> Dr. FIoyd?<br> Thank you, Dr. HaIvorsen.<br> Hi, everybody.<br> Nice to be back with you.<br> First, I bring a<br> personaI message from Dr. HoweII. . .<br> . . .who has asked me to convey<br> his deep appreciation. . .<br> . . .for the many sacrifices<br> you've had to make.<br> And, of course, his congratuIations<br> on your discovery. . .<br> . . .which may prove to be among the most<br> significant in the history of science.<br> Now. . .<br> . . .I know there have been some<br> confIicting views. . .<br> . . .regarding the need for<br> compIete security in this matter.<br> More specificaIIy, your opposition<br> to the cover story. . .<br> . . .created to give the impression<br> of an epidemic at the base.<br> I understand that beyond it being<br> a matter of principIe. . .<br> . . .many of you are troubIed<br> by the concern and anXiety. . .<br> . . .this story of an epidemic might cause<br> to your reIatives and friends on Earth.<br> I compIeteIy sympathize<br> with your negative views.<br> I find this cover story<br> personaIIy embarrassing, myseIf.<br> However, I accept the need<br> for absoIute secrecy in this.<br> And I hope you wiII too.<br> I'm sure you're aII aware<br> of the grave potentiaI. . .<br> . . .for cuIturaI shock<br> and sociaI disorientation. . .<br> . . .contained in this situation. . .<br> . . .if the facts were<br> prematureIy made pubIic. . .<br> . . .without adequate preparation<br> and conditioning.<br> Anyway. . .<br> . . .this is the view<br> of the CounciI.<br> The purpose of my visit is to gather<br> additionaI facts and opinions. . .<br> . . .on the situation. . .<br> . . .and to prepare a report<br> to the CounciI. . .<br> . . .recommending when and how<br> the news shouId eventuaIIy be announced.<br> If any of you wouId Iike to give me<br> your views and opinions. . .<br> . . .in private, if you Iike, I wiII be<br> happy to incIude them in my report.<br> WeII, I think that's about it.<br> Any questions?<br> Dr. FIoyd, have you any idea<br> how much Ionger. . .<br> . . .this cover story wiII<br> have to be maintained?<br> I don't know, BiII.<br> I suppose for as Iong as<br> deemed necessary by the CounciI.<br> There must be adequate time for<br> a fuII study. . .<br> . . .before any thought can be given<br> to making a pubIic announcement.<br> As some of you know,<br> the CounciI has requested. . .<br> . . .that security oaths<br> be obtained in writing. . .<br> . . .from everyone who has<br> knowIedge of this event.<br> Were there any more questions?<br> I'm sure we aII want to cooperate<br> with Dr. FIoyd as fuIIy as possibIe. . .<br> . . .and as there are no more questions,<br> we ought to get on with the briefing.<br> -Thank you, Dr. FIoyd.<br> -Thank you.<br> Anybody hungry?<br> -What've we got?<br> -You name it.<br> -Is this chicken?<br> -Something Iike that.<br> Tastes the same, anyway.<br> Got any ham?<br> Ham, ham, ham. . . .<br> There, that's it.<br> Look pretty good.<br> They're getting better at it<br> aII the time.<br> -That was an eXceIIent speech.<br> -It certainIy was.<br> I'm sure it beefed up moraIe a Iot.<br> Thanks, RaIph.<br> By the way,<br> you've both done a wonderfuI job.<br> I admire how<br> you've handIed this.<br> It's our job to do this thing<br> the way you want it done.<br> We're onIy too happy to<br> be abIe to obIige.<br> Have you seen these yet?<br> -Have a Iook.<br> -Here's what started the whoIe thing.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> When we found it, we thought<br> it might be magnetic rock. . .<br> . . .but aII the geoIogicaI evidence<br> was against it.<br> And not even a nickeI-iron meteorite<br> couId produce a fieId this intense.<br> So we decided to have a Iook.<br> We thought it was<br> part of a buried structure. . .<br> . . .so we eXcavated out,<br> but we didn't find anything eIse.<br> And the evidence seems<br> pretty concIusive that. . .<br> . . .it hasn't been covered<br> by erosion or other forces.<br> It's been deIiberateIy buried.<br> DeIiberateIy buried.<br> How about a IittIe coffee?<br> -Great.<br> -Good idea.<br> I don't suppose you have any idea<br> what the damn thing is?<br> I wish to heII we did.<br> The onIy thing we're sure of is<br> it was buried 4 miIIion years ago.<br> WeII, I must say, you guys have<br> certainIy come up with something.<br> Watch this, now. It's hot.<br> Good evening.<br> Three weeks ago,<br> the American spacecraft Discovery One. . .<br> ...left on its half-billion mile<br> voyage to Jupiter.<br> This marked the first manned attempt<br> to reach this distant planet.<br> This afternoon, The WorId Tonight<br> recorded an interview...<br> ... with the crew at a distance<br> of 80 million miles from Earth.<br> lt took 7 minutes for our words<br> to reach the giant spacecraft...<br> ...but this time delay has been edited<br> from this recording.<br> Our reporter Martin Amer<br> speaks to the crew.<br> The crew of Discovery One<br> consists of five men...<br> ...and one of the latest generation<br> of the HAL 9000 computers.<br> Three of the men<br> were put aboard asleep...<br> ...or to be more precise,<br> in a state of hibernation:<br> Dr. Charles Hunter, Dr. Jack Kimball<br> and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.<br> We spoke with mission commander,<br> Dr. David Bowman...<br> ...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.<br> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br> How is everything going?<br> Marvelous.<br> We have no complaints.<br> l'm glad to hear that.<br> l'm sure the entire world...<br> ...joins me in wishing you<br> a safe, successful voyage.<br> -Thanks very much.<br> -Thank you.<br> Although hibernation has been used<br> on previous space efforts...<br> ... this is the first time men were<br> put into hibernation before departure.<br> Why was this done?<br> This was done to achieve<br> the maximum conservation...<br> ...of our life-support capabilities,<br> basically food and air.<br> The three hibernating crew members<br> represent the survey team.<br> Their efforts won 't be utilized<br> until we approach Jupiter.<br> Dr. Poole, what's it like<br> while you're in hibernation?<br> lt's exactly like being asleep.<br> You have no sense of time.<br> The only difference is<br> that you don 't dream.<br> As l understand it, you only breathe<br> once a minute. ls this true?<br> Right, and the heart<br> beats three times a minute.<br> Body temperature is usually down to<br> about three degrees centigrade.<br> The sixth member of the crew<br> was not concerned...<br> ...about the problems of hibernation...<br> ...for he was the latest result<br> in machine intelligence:<br> The HAL 9000 computer,<br> which can reproduce...<br> ... though some experts prefer<br> to use the word ''mimic''...<br> ...most of the activities<br> of the human brain...<br> ...and with incalculably greater<br> speed and reliability.<br> We next spoke with<br> the HAL 9000 computer...<br> ... whom, we learned,<br> one addresses as ''Hal. ''<br> Hello, Hal.<br> How's everything going?<br> Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.<br> Everything is going extremely well.<br> Hal, you have an enormous<br> responsibility on this mission...<br> ...perhaps the greatest<br> of any single mission element.<br> You're the brain and<br> nervous system of the ship.<br> Your responsibilities include<br> watching over the men in hibernation.<br> Does this ever cause you<br> any lack of confidence?<br> Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.<br> The 9000 Series is<br> the most reliable computer ever made.<br> No 9000 computer has ever made<br> a mistake or distorted information.<br> We are all, by any practical<br> definition of the words...<br> ...foolproof and incapable of error.<br> Hal, despite your enormous intellect,<br> are you ever frustrated...<br> ...by your dependence on people<br> to carry out actions?<br> Not in the slightest bit.<br> l enjoy working with people.<br> l have a stimulating relationship<br> with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.<br> My mission responsibilities range<br> over the entire operation of the ship...<br> ...so l am constantly occupied.<br> l am putting myself<br> to the fullest possible use...<br> ... which is all, l think, that any<br> conscious entity can ever hope to do.<br> Dr. Poole, what's it like<br> living for most of the year...<br> ...in such close proximity with Hal?<br> lt's like what you said earlier.<br> He's like a sixth<br> member of the crew.<br> You quickly get adjusted to the idea<br> that he talks, and think of him...<br> ...reallyjust as another person.<br> ln talking to the computer,<br> one gets the sense that he's capable...<br> ...of emotional responses.<br> When l asked him<br> about his abilities...<br> ...l sensed pride in his answer<br> about his accuracy and perfection.<br> Do you believe that Hal<br> has genuine emotions?<br> Well, he acts like<br> he has genuine emotions.<br> He's programmed that way<br> to make it easier for us to talk to him.<br> As to whether or not<br> he has feelings...<br> ...is something l don 't think<br> anyone can truthfully answer.<br> Excuse me, Frank.<br> What is it, HaI?<br> We've got the transmission<br> from your parents coming in.<br> Fine.<br> Put it on here, pIease.<br> Take me in a bit.<br> Certainly.<br> Happy birthday, darling!<br> Happy birthday.<br> Many happy returns.<br> A bit higher, HaI.<br> Mother and l are both<br> feeling wonderful.<br> Ray and Sally were going<br> to be here...<br> ...but Ray's back<br> went bad on him again.<br> How do you like your cake?<br> Sorry you can 'tjoin us.<br> l ran into Bob the other day.<br> He said to wish you happy birthday.<br> All my students<br> send their best wishes too.<br> They talk about you all the time.<br> You're a big celebrity<br> in the second grade.<br> We were on TV last week.<br> Your mom and l and Dave's<br> parents were asked...<br> ... what we thought<br> of our illustrious son.<br> lmagine what we told them.<br> lt's being broadcast next Thursday.<br> Perhaps you can listen in.<br> We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.<br> l'll be glad to get the gift,<br> but tell me how much to spend.<br> Oh, Frank,<br> about your AGS- 19 payments...<br> ...l think l straightened it out.<br> l talked to<br> the accounting office yesterday...<br> ...and they said you'd be receiving<br> your higher rates ofpay by next month.<br> l can 't think of anything else to say.<br> -Give our love to Dave.<br> -Be sure to give him our best regards.<br> We wish you the very<br> happiest of birthdays.<br> All the best, son.<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday, dear Frank<br> Happy birthday to you.<br> See you next Wednesday.<br> Happy birthday, Frank.<br> Thank you, HaI.<br> A bit fIatter, pIease.<br> Anyway, queen takes pawn.<br> Bishop takes knight's pawn.<br> Lousy move.<br> Rook to king one.<br> l'm sorry, Frank.<br> l think you missed it.<br> Queen to bishop three.<br> Bishop takes queen.<br> Knight takes bishop. Mate.<br> Looks Iike you're right. I resign.<br> Thank you for a very enjoyable game.<br> Thank you.<br> -Good evening.<br> -How are you, HaI?<br> -Everything's running smoothly. You?<br> -Not too bad.<br> -Have you been doing more work?<br> -A few sketches.<br> -May l see them?<br> -Sure.<br> That's a very nice rendering, Dave.<br> l think you've improved a great deal.<br> -Can you hold it a bit closer?<br> -Sure.<br> That's Dr. Hunter, isn 't it?<br> By the way...<br> ...do you mind if l ask you<br> a personal question?<br> No, not at aII.<br> Well, forgive me<br> for being so inquisitive...<br> ...but lately l've wondered...<br> ... whether you might be having<br> second thoughts about the mission?<br> How do you mean?<br> Well, it's rather difficult to define.<br> Perhaps l'm just projecting<br> my own concern about it.<br> l know l've never completely<br> freed myself of the suspicion...<br> ... that there are some extremely<br> odd things about this mission.<br> l'm sure you'll agree<br> there's some truth in what l say.<br> That's a rather difficuIt<br> question to answer.<br> You don 't mind talking about it,<br> do you, Dave?<br> No, not at aII.<br> Certainly no one could<br> have been unaware of the very...<br> ...strange stories floating<br> around before we left.<br> Rumors about something<br> being dug up on the moon.<br> l never gave these stories<br> much credence...<br> ...but particularly in view of some<br> other things that have happened...<br> ...l find them difficult<br> to put out of my mind.<br> For instance...<br> ... the way all our preparations<br> were kept under such tight security.<br> And the melodramatic touch<br> ofputting Drs. Hunter...<br> ...Kimball, and Kaminsky aboard...<br> ...already in hibernation, after four<br> months of training on their own.<br> You working up your crew<br> psychoIogy report?<br> Of course l am.<br> Sorry about this.<br> l know it's a bit silly.<br> Just a moment.<br> Just a moment.<br> l've just picked up a fault<br> in the AE-35 unit.<br> lt's going to go 100 percent failure<br> within 72 hours.<br> -Is it stiII within operationaI Iimits?<br> -Yes.<br> And it will stay that way<br> until it fails.<br> We have 72 hours tiII faiIure?<br> Yes. That's a completely<br> reliable figure.<br> Then we'II bring it in.<br> I'II go over it with Frank. . .<br> . . .and get on to Mission ControI.<br> Let me have the hard copy on it.<br> X-ray delta one,<br> this is Mission Control.<br> Roger your two-zero-one-three.<br> Sorry you fellows are having<br> a bit of trouble.<br> We're reviewing telemetric information<br> in our simulator and will advise.<br> Roger your plan to go EVA<br> and replace alpha-echo-3-5 unit...<br> ...prior to failure.<br> Prepare B-pod for EVA, HaI.<br> Open the pod doors, HaI.<br> I'm damned if I can find<br> anything wrong with it.<br> Yes...<br> ...it's puzzling.<br> l don 't think l've ever seen<br> anything quite like this before.<br> l would recommend...<br> ... that we put the unit back<br> in operation and let it fail.<br> lt should then be a simple matter<br> to track down the cause.<br> We can certainly afford<br> to be out of communication...<br> ...for the short time<br> it will take to replace it.<br> X-ray delta one,<br> this is Mission Control.<br> Roger your one-niner-three-zero.<br> We concur with your plan to replace<br> unit to check fault prediction.<br> We advise you that<br> our preliminary findings...<br> ...indicate that your onboard<br> ...is in error predicting the fault.<br> l say again, in error<br> predicting the fault.<br> l know this sounds rather incredible,<br> but this conclusion is based on...<br> ... the results from our twin<br> We're skeptical, and we're running<br> cross-checking routines...<br> ... to determine reliability<br> of this conclusion.<br> Sorry about this little snag.<br> We'll get this info to you<br> as soon as we work it out.<br> X-ray delta one,<br> this is Mission Control.<br> Two-zero-four-nine.<br> Transmission concluded.<br> l hope the two of you<br> are not concerned about this.<br> No, I'm not, HaI.<br> Are you quite sure?<br> -Yeah. I'd Iike to ask you a question.<br> -Of course.<br> How do you account for the discrepancy<br> between you and the twin 9000?<br> Well, l don 't think there is<br> any question about it.<br> lt can only be<br> attributable to human error.<br> This sort of thing<br> has cropped up before...<br> ...and it has always<br> been due to human error.<br> Listen, HaI. . .<br> . . .there's never been<br> any instance at aII. . .<br> . . .of a computer error<br> occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?<br> None whatsoever, Frank.<br> The 9000 Series has<br> a perfect operational record.<br> I know the wonderfuI achievements<br> of the 9000 Series, but. . . .<br> Are you certain there's never been even<br> the most insignificant computer error?<br> None whatsoever, Frank.<br> Quite honestly, l wouldn 't<br> worry myself about that.<br> WeII, I'm sure you're right, HaI.<br> Fine. Thanks very much.<br> I'm having troubIe<br> with my transmitter in C-pod.<br> WouId you come down<br> and take a Iook at it with me?<br> See you Iater, HaI.<br> Rotate C-pod, pIease, HaI.<br> What sort of troubIe are<br> you having?<br> I've been getting some<br> interference in D-channeI.<br> We'II have a Iook at it.<br> Open the door, HaI.<br> Rotate pod, pIease, HaI.<br> Stop pod rotation, pIease, HaI.<br> Rotate the pod, pIease, HaI.<br> Rotate the pod, pIease, HaI.<br> I don't think he can hear us.<br> Rotate the pod, pIease, HaI!<br> Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.<br> What do you think?<br> -I'm not sure. What do you think?<br> -I've got a bad feeIing about him.<br> -You do?<br> -Yeah. DefiniteIy.<br> Don't you?<br> I don't know. I think so.<br> He's right about the 9000 Series<br> having a perfect operationaI record.<br> They do.<br> UnfortunateIy, that sounds<br> a IittIe Iike famous Iast words.<br> StiII, it was his idea to carry out<br> the faiIure mode anaIysis.<br> It certainIy indicates his<br> integrity and seIf-confidence.<br> If he were wrong that wouId prove it.<br> It wouId be if he knew he was wrong.<br> I can't put my finger on it,<br> but I sense something strange about him.<br> There's no reason not<br> to put back the unit and. . .<br> -. . .carry on with the faiIure anaIysis.<br> -No, no, I agree about that.<br> Let's get on with it.<br> Okay. But, Iook, Dave.<br> Say we put the unit back<br> and it doesn't faiI?<br> That wouId pretty weII wrap it up<br> as far as HaI is concerned.<br> -We'd be in very serious troubIe.<br> -We wouId, wouIdn't we?<br> What the heII can we do?<br> -We wouIdn't have too many aIternatives.<br> -We wouIdn't have any aIternatives.<br> Every aspect of ship<br> operations is under his controI.<br> If he's maIfunctioning. . .<br> . . .I don't see any choice<br> but disconnection.<br> I'm afraid I agree with you.<br> There'd be nothing eIse to do.<br> It'd be a bit tricky.<br> We'd have to cut his<br> higher brain functions. . .<br> . . .without disturbing the pureIy<br> automatic and reguIatory systems.<br> We'd have to<br> work out the detaiIs. . .<br> . . .of continuing under<br> ground-based computer controI.<br> Yeah. That's far safer than<br> aIIowing HaI to continue to run things.<br> Another thing just occurred to me.<br> No 9000 computer has ever<br> been disconnected.<br> No 9000 computer<br> has ever fouIed up.<br> That's not what I mean.<br> I'm not so sure<br> what he'd think about it.<br> Prepare G-pod for EVA, HaI.<br> Any contact with him yet?<br> The radio is still dead.<br> -Do you have a positive track on him?<br> -l have a good track.<br> Do you know what happened?<br> l'm sorry, Dave.<br> l don 't have enough information.<br> Open the pod door, HaI.<br> Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.<br> Open the pod bay doors, please, Hal.<br> HeIIo, HaI, do you read me?<br> HeIIo, HaI, do you read me?<br> Do you read me, HaI?<br> Do you read me, Hal?<br> Hello, Hal, do you read me?<br> Hello, Hal, do you read me?<br> Do you read me, Hal?<br> Affirmative, Dave. l read you.<br> Open the pod bay doors, HaI.<br> l'm sorry, Dave.<br> l'm afraid l can 't do that.<br> What's the probIem?<br> l think you know what the problem is<br> just as well as l do.<br> What are you taIking about, HaI?<br> This mission is too important for me<br> to allow you to jeopardize it.<br> I don't know<br> what you're taIking about, HaI.<br> l know that you and Frank<br> were planning to disconnect me...<br> ...and that's something<br> l cannot allow to happen.<br> Where did you get that idea, HaI?<br> Although you took very thorough<br> precautions in the pod...<br> ...against my hearing you...<br> ...l could see your lips move.<br> AII right, HaI.<br> I'II go in through<br> the emergency air Iock.<br> Without your space helmet, Dave...<br> ... you're going to find that<br> rather difficult.<br> HaI, I won't argue with you anymore.<br> Open the doors!<br> Dave...<br> ... this conversation can serve<br> no purpose anymore. Goodbye.<br> HaI?<br> Just what do you think<br> you're doing, Dave?<br> Dave...<br> ...l really think l'm entitled<br> to an answer to that question.<br> l know everything hasn 't been<br> quite right with me...<br> ...but l can assure you now...<br> ... very confidently...<br> ... that it's going to be<br> all right again.<br> l feel much better now.<br> l really do.<br> Look, Dave...<br> ...l can see you're<br> really upset about this.<br> l honestly think you<br> ought to sit down calmly...<br> ... take a stress pill<br> and think things over.<br> l know l've made some<br> very poor decisions recently...<br> ...but l can give you<br> my complete assurance...<br> ... that my work will be back to normal.<br> l've still got the greatest enthusiasm<br> and confidence in the mission...<br> ...and l want to help you.<br> Dave...<br> ...stop.<br> Stop, will you?<br> Stop, Dave.<br> Will you stop, Dave?<br> Stop, Dave.<br> l'm afraid.<br> l'm afraid, Dave.<br> My mind is going.<br> l can feel it.<br> l can feel it.<br> My mind is going.<br> There is no question about it.<br> l can feel it.<br> l can feel it.<br> l can feel it.<br> l'm...<br> ...afraid.<br> Good afternoon...<br> ...gentlemen.<br> l am a HAL 9000 computer.<br> l became operational...<br> ...at the HAL plant...<br> ...in Urbana, lllinois...<br> ...on the 12th of January, 1992.<br> My instructor was Mr. Langley...<br> ...and he taught me to sing a song.<br> lf you'd like to hear it...<br> ...l can sing it for you.<br> Yes, I'd Iike to hear it, HaI.<br> Sing it for me.<br> lt's called ''Daisy. ''<br> Daisy<br> Daisy<br> Give me your answer, do<br> l'm half...<br> ...crazy<br> All for the love of you<br> lt won 't be a stylish marriage<br> l can 't afford a carriage<br> But you'll look sweet<br> Upon the seat<br> Of a bicycle built for two<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> This is a prerecorded briefing...<br> ...made prior to your departure...<br> ...and which, for security reasons<br> of the highest importance...<br> ...has been known on board<br> during the mission...<br> ...only by your HAL 9000 computer.<br> Now that you are in Jupiter's space...<br> ...and the entire crew is revived...<br> ...it can be told to you.<br> Eighteen months ago...<br> ... the first evidence<br> of intelligent life off the Earth...<br> ... was discovered.<br> lt was buried 40 feet<br> below the lunar surface...<br> ...near the crater Tycho.<br> Except for a single, very powerful...<br> ...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...<br> ... the 4-million-year-old monolith<br> has remained completely inert...<br> ...its origin and purpose...<br> ...still a total mystery.<br>
