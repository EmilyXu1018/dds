I mean...<br> I mean, I'd like to do something for you...<br> ...if you'd do something for me.<br> Why, Mr. Dillon, of course<br> I'd be very glad to...<br> ...but what could I possibly do<br> for a big man like you?<br> Call me Abner.<br> When we got Dorothy Brock,<br> we got a great break.<br> Abner Dillon guarantees<br> to finance anything she does.<br> These days, stars like Dorothy Brock<br> are a dime a dozen.<br> That's what we got you for.<br> Julian Marsh, the greatest musical<br> comedy director in America today.<br> What do you mean, today?<br> All right, tomorrow too.<br> Say, with your reputation...<br> Did you ever try to cash<br> a reputation at a bank?<br> I'm in this for one reason only:<br> Money.<br> Money? You?<br> With all your hits,<br> you ought to be worth plenty.<br> I ought to be, but I'm not.<br> Did you ever hear of Wall Street?<br> Excuse me, Mr. Marsh, there's<br> a phone call for you. A Dr. Chadwick.<br> I'll call him back.<br> - He says it's urgent.<br> About your examination.<br> Use our private phone, Julian.<br> What is it, doc?<br> You have?<br> Good Lord, you're not a machine.<br> That body of yours will stand just so much.<br> There's no other way.<br> You're not just headed<br> for another nervous breakdown.<br> Any undue strain on your part<br> might easily prove fatal.<br> Sorry, doc, but I've got to risk it.<br> Anything wrong?<br> You won't have another breakdown?<br> - The contract's signed.<br> That doesn't matter.<br> - That's all right. It holds.<br> You'll get your Pretty Lady.<br> You haven't got anything to worry about.<br> I'm not gonna let you down...<br> ...because I can't afford to.<br> I've given everything I've had<br> to that gulch down there.<br> It paid me, sure,<br> in money I couldn't hang on to...<br> ...fair-weather friends,<br> women, headlines.<br> Why, even the cops and the newsboys<br> recognize me on sight.<br> 'Marsh the Magnificent.'<br> 'Marsh the Slave Driver.'<br> Actors tell you how Marsh<br> drove them, bullied them...<br> ...and tore it out of them.<br> A few would tell you<br> how Marsh made them.<br> They've all got something to show,<br> except Marsh.<br> Well, this is my last shot.<br> I'll make more actors, but this time<br> I'll sock my money away so hard...<br> ...they'll have to blast<br> to find enough to buy a newspaper.<br> That's why I'm going ahead<br> with Pretty Lady.<br> Pretty Lady has to be a hit.<br> It's my last show,<br> and it's got to be my best.<br> You're counting on me.<br> I'm counting on Pretty Lady...<br> ...because it's got to support me<br> for a long time.<br> Wait.<br> - Remember...<br> ...my contract makes me boss with<br> a capital B. What I say, goes.<br> Now, make the chorus call<br> for 10:00 tomorrow.<br> He'll drive us crazy<br> before we get this show on.<br> Yeah, but suppose that guy<br> should pass out on us?<br> New York will see its first triple funeral.<br> Good morning.<br> Mr. Marsh will be here soon.<br> Quiet now. Quiet, please.<br> Quiet, everybody, quiet.<br> Hello, Jerry. How are you?<br> It's too good to be true.<br> How's the turnout, Mac?<br> About 50-50. Half are dumb<br> and the other half are dumber.<br> Andy.<br> He's so busy.<br> Lorraine has been hitting the bottle.<br> - The peroxide bottle.<br> You wanna get me canned?<br> You're set, you're in. Now scram.<br> Darling, you're just too sweet,<br> the way you keep spoiling me.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> It's okay. This is a two-way street.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> But are you, by any chance, the...<br> What is the word?<br> The stage manager?<br> Hey, Ann, come out from<br> under that accent. I see you.<br> Lolly.<br> Darling.<br> You remember Ann Lowell?<br> Not Anytime Annie?<br> Who could forget her?<br> She only said no once,<br> when she didn't hear the question.<br> You been abroad?<br> Andy?<br> Where's Andy Lee?<br> Yes, Mr. Marsh. Coming right up.<br> Good morning, Mr. Marsh.<br> Line them up.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Okay, girls, line up. Come on.<br> Quiet, now. Quiet.<br> Come on, now. Quiet, girls.<br> I want all the dancers to line up<br> and double-lined out front.<br> Showgirls can double-line in back<br> of them and the boys in back of them.<br> Don't spread out.<br> Come on, girls, hurry up.<br> I really had a charming summer<br> in Deauville, dear.<br> Yes, but don't you find Sir George<br> impossible at times?<br> Get a load of 'Minnie the Mountaineer.'<br> It must have been tough on your<br> mother, not having any children.<br> That's telling them.<br> Oh, dear.<br> You looking for somebody,<br> or just shopping around?<br> Where will I find the gentleman in charge?<br> First door to your left, dearie.<br> I know, but...<br> Don't knock. He's expecting you.<br> - But that's the...<br> Our mistake. The other door.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Hey, what's the idea?<br> They said...<br> Weren't you expecting me?<br> Well, not exactly,<br> but I'm afraid you'll do.<br> Well, I don't understand.<br> I don't either. What are you looking for?<br> Well, isn't this the...?<br> Wait till I get my clothes on.<br> I'll show you where it is.<br> It isn't an 'it,' it's a 'he.'<br> Maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing.<br> Let's start over again.<br> I'm Billy Lawler,<br> one of Broadway's better juveniles.<br> I thought you were important.<br> That's the way most people<br> feel about juveniles.<br> Only most of them aren't so frank about it.<br> You're new to show business?<br> - Oh, I've had experience.<br> How many shows?<br> - Why, any number of them.<br> Come on, now.<br> - To tell you the truth...<br> I want the truth.<br> This'll be my first, if they take me.<br> If they take you? Say, you can't miss.<br> I'll take you in myself.<br> I'll steer you right up to the stage director.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> A short order of ham, coming out.<br> Not good, but loud.<br> Honey, take a good look at them now.<br> Because after they make that back line,<br> you won't see them again.<br> If it isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy<br> and the village maiden.<br> Just a minute.<br> Where are you headed, sister?<br> She wants to see Marsh.<br> - That'll make Marsh's day perfect.<br> Come on, girls, inside.<br> There's the boss right there.<br> His name is Julian Marsh.<br> He's the fellow with the light green<br> felt hat. Go over and talk to him.<br> Quit shoving.<br> Lift the skirts up a little higher.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Afraid I got a run.<br> First door to your left.<br> - In my stocking.<br> First offense?<br> Yes, but I don't think<br> I ought to tell them that.<br> No, of course not.<br> And they'll never guess.<br> Do you think I'll do?<br> I only know what I read in the papers,<br> but you look all right to me.<br> Andy. Get the first eight girls.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Will the first eight girls line up here?<br> The first eight girls line up<br> down in front. Come on.<br> Now lift your dresses up.<br> Come on, higher.<br> I want to see the legs.<br> Yeah, they got pretty faces too.<br> Turn around. Come on, turn around.<br> Oh, dear, not a calf in a carload.<br> Get the next eight.<br> - Next eight, come on.<br> Stick with us,<br> and you'll come in on the tide.<br> Hurry up, hurry up.<br> - Line up, girls.<br> Hurry up, girls. Lift your dresses up.<br> Do you mind holding Fifi for me?<br> - Turn around now, please.<br> All right, back.<br> Three.<br> Okay those three on the left.<br> If I were you, I'd keep them.<br> I suppose if I don't, you'll have to.<br> Lorraine again, huh?<br> Andy, you're a panic.<br> All right, have it your way.<br> Mac, okay by special request<br> of the copyright owner.<br> All right, next eight. Hurry up.<br> - Next eight girls.<br> What's yours?<br> Diane Lorrimer. 333 Park Avenue.<br> And is her homework tough.<br> Next.<br> Adams. Arnold.<br> Kipling.<br> What's the matter?<br> Well, what is it, what is it?<br> What's the matter now?<br> Must have been a slip-up someplace.<br> We're a girl short.<br> Well, that's great. Just great.<br> We also need a dance director who can<br> count to 40 without a pad and pencil.<br> Well, do something. Get another girl.<br> Are you gonna stand there<br> and shake a blond out your pantlegs?<br> I don't want to butt in...<br> - A lot of people are like that.<br> I can have one up here in the morning.<br> - That's ducky. I can hardly wait.<br> Mr. Marsh, you don't have to wait.<br> And she's a swell dancer too.<br> You picked her, but she got<br> eliminated the third time through.<br> Come out from behind there.<br> Hey, you, with the legs.<br> Come out of there.<br> Quiet. Quiet, please.<br> Quiet, please.<br> Well, I'm a... Hey, kid. Hey, you.<br> Hey, come on, get up.<br> The boss wants to see you again.<br> - Who? Me?<br> Come on, come on.<br> All right, she'll do.<br> They're all yours, Andy.<br> All right, get in line.<br> All right, now, everybody.<br> Quiet, and listen to me.<br> Tomorrow morning,<br> we're gonna start a show.<br> We'll rehearse for five weeks,<br> and we'll open on scheduled time...<br> ...and I mean, scheduled time.<br> You'll work and sweat<br> and work some more.<br> You'll work days and nights...<br> ...and you'll work between time,<br> when I think you need it.<br> You'll dance until your feet fall off<br> and you can't stand up...<br> ...but five weeks from now,<br> we're going to have a show.<br> Some of you have been with me before.<br> You know it'll be tough.<br> It'll be the toughest five weeks<br> that you ever lived through.<br> Do you all get that?<br> Anybody who doesn't think he'll like it,<br> better quit right now.<br> What do I hear?<br> Nobody?<br> Good. Then that's settled.<br> We start tomorrow morning.<br> All right, 10:00 tomorrow morning,<br> we start with the lyrics.<br> In practice clothes.<br> What did I tell him?<br> This is what I told him:<br> 'No, I won't run your stage for that money.'<br> Great. You beat Jerry<br> to the finish by two lengths.<br> All right, take your positions.<br> We'll try those routines again.<br> Quiet. Where do you think you are, home?<br> I get back to New York and I get this wire.<br> Come on, kids, make it snappy.<br> All right, Jerry, let's go.<br> Dorothy, that's your cue.<br> Things can never be the same now.<br> I beg your pardon,<br> but would you mind saying:<br> 'Things can never be the same now'?<br> That's what I said.<br> - You did not.<br> You said, 'Things can<br> never be the same now.'<br> I did not.<br> - You did.<br> Who's directing this show?<br> - She's reading my lines wrong.<br> I am not.<br> - What did you say?<br> I said, 'Things can<br> never be the same now.'<br> That's right.<br> Things can never be the same now.<br> The scene ends with you on the steps,<br> and you go into the number.<br> That's where you take his hand.<br> The scene ends with you two<br> on the steps, and we go into the duet.<br> You're doing fine for a beginner.<br> - Well, thanks. I'm trying.<br> I was so scared that first day,<br> I walked around the block four times...<br> ...before I had the courage to even<br> come and apply for this job.<br> It's tough, but you'll get along.<br> Well, I wouldn't mind, if I could<br> only get that routine set.<br> I'll show you those taps.<br> Come on with me.<br> Taps?<br> Say, I can do a tap dance on my ear.<br> What bothers me is that routine.<br> Then I'm just what<br> the doctor ordered. Come along.<br> Now, look.<br> Cross over.<br> You're gluttons for punishment.<br> Well, Mr...<br> Well, this boy's showing me.<br> I was trying to make her...<br> - Trying to make her is right.<br> We'll just let that pass. Now try it again.<br> Where you sitting?<br> - On a flagpole, dearie. On a flagpole.<br> I always said she was a nice girl.<br> She's so good to her mother.<br> She sure is. She makes $45 a week<br> and sends her mother 100 of it.<br> Get some feeling into it, will you?<br> What do you want me to do,<br> bite my nails?<br> You've got the busiest hands.<br> Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> It's out.<br> That'll be enough of that. It smells.<br> You don't like this number?<br> Sure, I like it.<br> I've liked it since 1905.<br> You think this is a revival?<br> It's out. The whole number.<br> - This number will be a riot.<br> That's what I'm afraid of.<br> Dismiss. An hour for lunch.<br> All right, everybody.<br> One hour for lunch.<br> Waiting long, darling?<br> Well, long enough.<br> My, but we're grouchy, aren't we?<br> Oh, no, not that, but...<br> - What?<br> I'm getting tired of<br> this hiding in doorways...<br> ...sneaking in and out of places<br> and keeping under cover.<br> Why, I'm beginning to feel like a criminal.<br> There's nothing criminal in that, is there?<br> No, there's nothing criminal in that.<br> I thought we'd better tell you,<br> it looks like we're in trouble.<br> That word has a familiar sound.<br> Are you married too?<br> This is serious, Julian.<br> Serious? Did you ever leave your wife...<br> ...sitting alone in a nightclub,<br> holding the check?<br> You know Abner Dillon's<br> putting up the bankroll for our show.<br> I knew he wasn't here<br> because you liked his face.<br> I don't like his face or any part of him.<br> He looks like a Bulgarian boll weevil<br> mourning its first-born.<br> Well, his interest in our show<br> is Dorothy Brock.<br> And his interest is our principal.<br> Very good. Very, very good.<br> Even I was able to gather that much.<br> Yes? Well, we stand a first-rate<br> chance of having him...<br> ...withdraw his financial support.<br> Now, did you gather that?<br> Because dear Miss Brock is two-timing<br> Abner right under his very nose.<br> With a fellow who used<br> to be her partner in vaudeville.<br> She's come up in the business,<br> he hangs around.<br> He's been out of town<br> and just got back last week.<br> If Dillon finds out... And if he doesn't,<br> he's dumber than I thought...<br> Well, now, wait.<br> Nobody could be as dumb as all that.<br> He'll just walk out on us<br> and we'll be sunk, that's what...<br> ...if we don't do something.<br> Tried applying dough to the problem?<br> Give the Romeo 100 bucks.<br> Get him out of the way.<br> We might try using a little flint.<br> You don't know this guy Denning.<br> That's his name. Pat Denning.<br> He's not the kind of guy that<br> gets sent places just like that.<br> Oh, no, he gets train-sick.<br> Oh, I see. Hard-boiled, huh?<br> Well, it's going to be just too bad...<br> ...but nobody's gonna ruin my show.<br> - What'll you do?<br> I'll talk it over with Murphy,<br> a friend of mine from downtown.<br> Slim Murphy?<br> Murphy will kill him.<br> That'll teach him a good lesson.<br> I don't want to be mixed up<br> with Murphy or any other gangsters.<br> One man's meat is another man's Murphy.<br> I told you what this show means to me.<br> Well, this is what it does mean.<br> Hello, Murphy? This is Julian Marsh.<br> Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Listen to me.<br> You gotta do me a favor.<br> Did you ever hear of Dorothy Brock?<br> Good, that makes it so much easier.<br> Well, listen to me and get this.<br> It seems there's a certain guy<br> by the name of Denning.<br> D-E-N...<br> N-l-N-G.<br> I got you, Mr. Marsh. Sure.<br> Hey, pipe down.<br> What do you think I got on, earphones?<br> It's as good as done.<br> Say, you ain't gonna forget me<br> on ducats for the new show, are you?<br> Thattaboy.<br> Not another nickel, honey.<br> Just can't be done anymore, that's all.<br> Pat, don't be silly.<br> We've always shared<br> and shared alike, haven't we?<br> What's come over you?<br> Getting a sudden attack<br> of manhood, possibly.<br> Let's quit kidding ourselves.<br> I'm a regular anchor around your neck.<br> You're not.<br> - I am.<br> Besides, never being able to see you...<br> ...except when nobody's looking<br> is getting me down.<br> But, darling,<br> I owe everything I am to you.<br> It was you and that act of ours<br> that started me in all this.<br> Why, you trained me and coached me<br> and taught me all I know.<br> I was pretty dumb too.<br> I haven't forgotten.<br> - The act?<br> It was grand, Pat. Really grand.<br> It was terrible.<br> - You didn't think so then.<br> You mean I didn't say so then.<br> Oh, Dot, you've gone ahead.<br> You've earned it. I've stayed<br> behind where I belong, I guess.<br> You've kept yourself behind.<br> Nothing of the sort. They wanted you.<br> They never wanted me.<br> Besides, I've been getting myself<br> some education...<br> ...and they have a name<br> for a man who doesn't work...<br> ...who accepts money from a woman.<br> It isn't a very nice name.<br> Darling, you're talking like a child.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> There isn't any other reason, is there?<br> - No.<br> Sure?<br> - Sure, I'm sure.<br> It's late. I'll take you home.<br> Keep the change.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> I wish you didn't feel that way.<br> - So do I, but I do.<br> Watch your tempo. Watch it, will you?<br> Get your feet off the floor.<br> Faster, faster.<br> Come on, faster. Faster.<br> Stop it, stop it, stop it.<br> It's brutal.<br> May I remind you that Pretty Lady's<br> out-of-town opening is not far away?<br> It's been advertised as<br> a musical comedy with dancing.<br> If it isn't asking too much,<br> will you please show me a little?<br> All right, once again. Give it something.<br> Come on. Ready, Jerry?<br> Get into it now. Come on.<br> Having fun?<br> After three weeks,<br> a leg ain't nothing to me...<br> ...but something to stand on.<br> Let me hear your number, Dorothy.<br> Come on, Jerry. The 'Habit' number.<br> Jerry, put it up a half tone, will you?<br> Doesn't she sing gorgeous?<br> Seventy thousand bucks.<br> Watch this, honey.<br> I may want you to understudy her.<br> All right, okay.<br> Come on, folks, get ready for<br> the duet number. Start up.<br> Okay, Jerry, let's go.<br> Come on, faster.<br> Faster, Jerry, faster.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You all right, kid?<br> - I guess so.<br> Come on, faster. Faster.<br> Peggy.<br> Stand back. Get back in line.<br> - She's fainted.<br> Come on now, places.<br> This is a rehearsal, not a rest cue.<br> Mac, take her outside. Hurry up.<br> Come on, everybody.<br> All right, come on, get back.<br> Jerry, let's go.<br> Come on, pick it up.<br> Here, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hold your places.<br> - Lawler, inside.<br> The girl's okay.<br> - You feel better, honey?<br> I guess I fainted.<br> That's a good guess.<br> Well, I guess I'm all right now.<br> Bad guess. Better sit down again.<br> Now listen, you let me play now.<br> What would you suggest, doctor?<br> A little fresh air and conversation.<br> What about Mr. Marsh?<br> Never mind Mr. Marsh.<br> Let's sit this dance out.<br> And if I lose my job?<br> If you do, there just won't be any show.<br> Anyway, it's a nice idea.<br> I've got a lot of nice ideas.<br> What I need are ears to spill them in.<br> Well, won't mine do?<br> Yes, you know, I think<br> they'd do very, very nicely.<br> When are your ears available?<br> At all sorts of odd hours.<br> You must look them up sometime.<br> Remind me to tell you you're swell.<br> That's all for tonight.<br> - All right, dismissed, girls.<br> Well, thanks, doctor.<br> Your prescription was great.<br> Now for the workshop.<br> You gotta take it daily to really do any good.<br> It'll have to be absent treatment, I'm afraid.<br> At least for the time being.<br> Good night, Jimmy.<br> - Good night.<br> Coming, Abner?<br> Dorothy, where will we eat?<br> You know, Abner,<br> I'm not a bit hungry.<br> But I'm all dressed for dinner.<br> - Oh, yes, so you are.<br> I'll get the car.<br> Dorothy, the car's here.<br> - Yes, Abner.<br> Why, doctor, you must like it here.<br> I'm beginning to.<br> I'm not the doctor anymore, you are.<br> I've become the patient,<br> and I'd like a little advice.<br> Very well, but you might tell<br> the doctor your name.<br> I couldn't do that,<br> but my initials are Pat Denning.<br> What do you advise for a man<br> who's both hungry and lonesome?<br> Company.<br> - Excellent.<br> Did you have anyone in mind?<br> Did you?<br> - Will you?<br> I'm very much afraid I will.<br> - Good.<br> Good night, Pat.<br> It was a wonderful evening.<br> I'll see you again?<br> - I hope so.<br> Good.<br> - Good night.<br> Hey, got a match?<br> Yep. I guess so.<br> Happen to know a guy<br> named Pat Denning?<br> Why, yes.<br> - We've got a message for him.<br> This guy Denning's a pretty wise mug,<br> but he ain't wise enough.<br> If he don't lay off Dorothy Brock,<br> it'll be just too bad...<br> ...for Denning. Get me?<br> I'll tell him.<br> - Yeah, well...<br> That's so you don't forget.<br> - Pat.<br> Who were they?<br> Friends with good advice.<br> - Are you hurt?<br> Not much.<br> But, Pat, tell me what happened.<br> Better let it drop.<br> Besides, it's hardly a bedtime<br> story for a nice girl like you.<br> What do you think this is?<br> Get that man out of here.<br> But, Mrs. Holt...<br> - But nothing.<br> I have eyes.<br> Just because there's a depression on,<br> some folks think I'll stand for it.<br> But you don't know.<br> After running a rooming house for 19<br> years, there's nothing I don't know.<br> Now you get out, and no more talk.<br> Then if he goes, I go too.<br> Probably I'll be able to bear<br> up under that blow too.<br> Well...<br> ...where do we go from here?<br> Hotel?<br> - I suppose so.<br> But it'll have to be inexpensive,<br> as I only have a dollar and a half.<br> What about my place?<br> - Broke?<br> Not exactly.<br> Not exactly flush either.<br> Then I guess it's your place<br> or a park bench.<br> Here you are.<br> That's better.<br> Hand me your coat.<br> Make yourself comfortable.<br> Will you excuse me a minute?<br> Rose-colored glasses.<br> Let's see how the world looks.<br> Okay, doctor.<br> - Here we go.<br> Things beginning to look any better?<br> - A little bit.<br> Tired, aren't you?<br> - Dead tired.<br> And I feel just like beginning.<br> You hop, step and jump<br> as many miles as I have today...<br> ...and you'd be tired too.<br> Pat, what are you doing?<br> Please put me down.<br> Please, Pat. Please put me down.<br> Now you go right to sleep, youngster.<br> What you need is a good night's rest.<br> Good night.<br> Will you hand me my bag, please?<br> Oh, which one?<br> - That one.<br> Here you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> What do you do when you've<br> got left feet like mine?<br> Just pick them up and lay them down.<br> - I'm doing the best I can.<br> Get a load of the juvenile.<br> Didn't know we had elephants in the show.<br> Wait a minute, hold it.<br> Hold it, Jerry.<br> Some director's gonna jail you for<br> taking money under false pretenses.<br> You're supposed to be a dancer.<br> You just need license plates<br> to look like a Model T Ford.<br> They've been going all night long...<br> I'll keep them here if it takes a week.<br> All right, get out.<br> Take the last eight bars.<br> - Pick it up, Jerry.<br> Pick it up, Jerry.<br> Hello, honey.<br> - Oh, Dot, how are you?<br> Tea for two.<br> Friend of mine dropped in.<br> Love me?<br> I wonder.<br> You're not going to get<br> serious on me, are you?<br> You leaving town?<br> - Yeah.<br> Stock job in...<br> ...Philadelphia.<br> Oh, Pat, without telling me?<br> Well, I thought it was the best way.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Sit down, dear.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> I've done a lot of thinking<br> since the other night.<br> You know what's wrong with me,<br> or rather, with us?<br> We've grown too necessary to one another.<br> You've been content in the shadows<br> while I basked in the spotlight...<br> ...simply because it's held us together.<br> My success has been your failure.<br> - Well, dear...<br> ...my failure, as you put it,<br> has been my happiness.<br> But, darling, you're capable<br> of such great things.<br> You're not a quitter.<br> I've only wanted to help,<br> but I've been hurting you instead.<br> I realize that now.<br> That's why I came here this morning.<br> We're not going to see<br> each other for a long time.<br> No more doorways.<br> No more secret meetings.<br> You're going out on your own<br> and make a success.<br> You're right, Dot. But you know...<br> ...somehow, I can't imagine<br> going on without you.<br> Nor I without you...<br> ...but it's got to be.<br> Yes, Dot. It's got to be.<br> And maybe, someday...<br> ...someplace?<br> Maybe.<br> Bye, Pat.<br> Oh, Dot...<br> I love you.<br> Me too.<br> Up.<br> Up.<br> How are you, Bluebeard?<br> - Okay, just a touch of scarlet fever.<br> Oh, that's fine. Maybe it'll<br> develop into something serious.<br> The curtain's just come down.<br> It's the end.<br> Is this what you call a finale?<br> What is this? Amateur night?<br> Have we been rehearsing for<br> five weeks, or did I dream it?<br> The show's ragged.<br> What do you mean, the show's ragged?<br> - The numbers are ragged.<br> May I remind all you shining lights that...<br> ...this is the company<br> that opens tomorrow night?<br> I am in the right theater, am I not?<br> This is the Pretty Lady company,<br> isn't it?<br> The all-star show that...<br> ...opens in Philadelphia tomorrow night?<br> Philadelphia?<br> - Quiet.<br> Quiet.<br> Philadelphia, PA.<br> Yeah, and on Sundays, it's P-U.<br> Quiet.<br> - Quiet.<br> Julian...<br> ...you mean Atlantic City, don't you?<br> - I mean Philadelphia.<br> Train leaves at 1 p.m., Penn Station.<br> Full dress rehearsal, 4:00.<br> Arch Street Theater.<br> But I don't want to go to Philadelphia.<br> Who does? We couldn't get<br> the house at Atlantic City.<br> But why Philadelphia?<br> Well, when you become stage director...<br> ...we'll open in your apartment.<br> But right now, it's Philadelphia.<br> Of all the cities in the United States,<br> he would pick Philadelphia.<br> All right now, listen to me.<br> We open at the Arch Street<br> Theater tomorrow night.<br> So this is Philadelphia.<br> Why don't you stop that?.<br> Peggy.<br> Getting a kick out of it?<br> - Of course, you?<br> I don't know. Do you suppose<br> anybody'll even know I'm in the show?<br> I will.<br> Does it make any difference to you?<br> Gee, Billy. I've been for you<br> since that first day.<br> Places, everybody.<br> I'll be seeing you.<br> You won't forget the modulation<br> on the last eight bars.<br> You forgot your handkerchief.<br> - Go ahead.<br> Call those timers, hold them.<br> nice to the right people,<br> you'll get along.<br> When you walk downstage...<br> ...just give it a little life.<br> You know, sort of...<br> Quiet. Please.<br> Well, it's...<br> ...not good, it's not bad.<br> That's all for tonight.<br> Wait.<br> - Hold it.<br> Come back here, girls.<br> I want you all to take<br> your minds off the show.<br> Get out and relax.<br> Forget it till 10:00 tomorrow morning.<br> I don't know. I think it'll do.<br> But I want you to come back tomorrow...<br> ...to give the best performance<br> that you ever gave in your lives.<br> Company dismissed.<br> Dismissed, girls.<br> - Company dismissed.<br> Go on out and have a good time.<br> You really was elegant, Miss Brock.<br> Pansy, did anyone telephone me?<br> Phone?<br> No, ma'am. Nobody at all.<br> You're sure?<br> - I certainly is. Yes, Miss Brock.<br> Have a little supper with me, huh?<br> - I would have.<br> But you thought of it too late.<br> - I've been thinking of it all day.<br> Well, I'm not a mind reader.<br> I've got a date.<br> I'm free tomorrow night.<br> - Then it's a date.<br> Don't forget, now.<br> I gotta get the stuff for the party.<br> Do you mind?<br> I'll see you at the hotel,<br> room 1061, and make it snappy.<br> She says for you to wait.<br> She'll be out in just a minute.<br> Good night, Mr. Marsh.<br> I said, 'What is it? A duck?'<br> Andy, you're terrible.<br> You know any more?<br> I've got a lot more...<br> Andy?<br> Yes, sir?<br> - Go on, yes man. Papa give you liver.<br> Shut up. This may be important.<br> Oh, it can't be, darling.<br> He's calling you.<br> Hurry up.<br> Sit down, Andy.<br> Anything wrong, chief?<br> Everything's wrong, Andy.<br> No, you're a great director, Mr. Marsh.<br> Maybe I was, but...<br> ...right now I'm a sick man.<br> They told me I was sick when<br> I started, but I started anyway.<br> Andy, I'm going to finish,<br> and I'm gonna have a show.<br> I know what they'll say.<br> They'll like it. They've got to.<br> 'Marsh is a wizard.<br> He turns them out like clockwork.<br> The guy isn't human. He's a machine.'<br> Well, I'm not a machine, Andy.<br> And for the first time, I'm counting<br> on someone else. I've got to.<br> I'm counting on you. And tomorrow<br> night, we're gonna give them a show.<br> The greatest show<br> Julian Marsh ever put on.<br> What are you doing?<br> Got a date tonight?<br> No.<br> Come on home with me, will you?<br> I'm lonesome.<br> Taxi.<br> Pat. What are you doing in Philadelphia?<br> Got my passport and dropped over.<br> Business or pleasure?<br> - I don't know yet, but it's a job.<br> Say, what about one of those cozy<br> midnight suppers one reads about?<br> I've been hoping you'd come out.<br> Oh, dear, I have a date.<br> - Well, break it.<br> I'd like to, but I can't.<br> - Well, you can try.<br> It's with the company and we open<br> tomorrow. I really should be on hand.<br> I understand. Let me drive<br> you to the main event.<br> All right.<br> Taxi.<br> Congress Hotel.<br> Forget something, Dorothy?<br> Congress Hotel.<br> Oh, Abner. Isn't this car big<br> enough for two? Move over.<br> You ain't gonna have<br> another spell, are you?<br> I'm tired. Dress rehearsal is no picnic.<br> A little party'll do you good.<br> Don't just being with me cheer you up?<br> Oh, tremendously.<br> I'm practically hysterical right now.<br> Oh, don't be afraid of me.<br> I got strength.<br> I used to be the intercollegiate<br> champion hop, skip and jumper.<br> Come on now, hurry up.<br> - Here I come.<br> Give the little boy a big hand.<br> Right across your big mouth.<br> Please.<br> I tell you, I don't even know<br> my own strength. Wait a minute.<br> Just look here.<br> Oh, you're too, too divine.<br> Tomorrow you've got to give<br> a performance, not an exhibition.<br> Well, you'd never know it<br> from the manuscript.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> She's right.<br> Let's dance.<br> - I don't want to.<br> Come on, I wanna dance.<br> - Stop mauling me.<br> Let me alone.<br> You're not funny to me tonight.<br> I've got half a mind...<br> - You're telling me.<br> Do you wanna cramp your act?<br> In a star, it's temperament,<br> but in a chorus girl, it's just bad taste.<br> What is this, target practice?<br> Why can't you let me alone?<br> Wisecracks, I'm sick of them.<br> I'm tired of you.<br> Tired of all of you, do you hear?<br> Why, Dorothy.<br> You know, you better hop on your<br> Kiddie Kar and go back to Cleveland.<br> Excuse me, it's the tight shoes.<br> Shut up.<br> Where are you going?<br> - Maybe she needs me.<br> Are you going to be a sucker for that?<br> - Sucker. You listen to me.<br> $ 70,000 is a lot of money<br> to pay for a pack of insults.<br> So you've been calling me<br> a sucker behind my back, eh?<br> Well, I ain't a sucker for anybody.<br> Dorothy don't mean that to me.<br> If not for me, she wouldn't<br> have had a show to star in.<br> She better not try to give me the air now.<br> Now...<br> So that's it, is it?<br> You small-town big shot.<br> Now don't start...<br> - Shut up.<br> So I better not give you the air, eh?<br> Well, that's exactly what<br> I'm giving you right now.<br> Now get out of my room, you sucker.<br> Get out.<br> Try and make me.<br> Don't do that again.<br> - Get out.<br> Get out.<br> No place for anybody<br> whose insurance ain't paid.<br> Wait for me.<br> And the next time you come to<br> a lady's apartment, act like a lady.<br> Please.<br> We've located Mr. Denning for you.<br> Get him for me, will you?<br> Oh, now what?<br> Hello, Dorothy.<br> - Hello, Pat...<br> Pat, I can't stand it any longer.<br> I've gotta see you.<br> Yes, but...<br> - Please don't ask me why.<br> Just come quickly, please.<br> All right, dear. I'll be right over.<br> Come in.<br> Sorry, Julian.<br> More trouble.<br> What's up?<br> - Dorothy's out of the show.<br> Definitely, once and for all, she's out.<br> Well, let me have it. What happened?<br> She threw me out of her room.<br> That's what.<br> Now you want to throw her out.<br> What is this? A game?<br> You can't do it.<br> - Oh, no?<br> Brock's in my show and that's final.<br> If Dorothy stays in...<br> ...this show don't open<br> tomorrow night. That's final.<br> Why, you potbellied sap.<br> I resent that.<br> You've sunk $ 70,000 already,<br> and you're gonna toss that away...<br> ...because of a dame?<br> That's my funeral, ain't it?<br> And the funeral of 200 other people:<br> chorus girls, boys, electricians.<br> You wouldn't be that mean, would you?<br> Well, I think she ought to apologize.<br> Why, of course she'll apologize.<br> She'll be sorry by morning.<br> I wish you wouldn't take it like this.<br> Back in New York, they're calling you<br> 'The Angel of Broadway.'<br> Sure.<br> - Are they?<br> Well...<br> ...I guess maybe I can overlook it,<br> if she apologizes.<br> But it must be tonight.<br> That's final.<br> What's the matter?<br> You don't seem to be warming up at all.<br> Oh, don't, Terry. Please.<br> Come on, this is no way to act.<br> You've got me wrong, Terry.<br> I'm not acting.<br> I just don't like to be pawed, that's all.<br> Come here, honey.<br> Why, you don't know...<br> Must have been a fuse.<br> - Yeah, a fuse named Charlie.<br> Peggy.<br> Go get her, Terry.<br> Come on, let's have another drink.<br> Going down?<br> - No, sir. Up.<br> If he cramps our show now...<br> We fixed him once before,<br> and we can do it again. Let's get Marsh.<br> What?<br> - Mr. Denning. Is he here?<br> You know he is. What do you want?<br> - Mr. Denning.<br> Can't leave him alone for<br> five minutes, can you?<br> Please, Miss Brock. This is important.<br> What's the matter?<br> Oh, Pat, there's going to be trouble. I saw...<br> Oh. So it's 'Pat' to him,<br> but it's 'Mr. Denning' to me.<br> You bet there's gonna be trouble.<br> Let's see what it's about.<br> - I know what it's about.<br> She's been spying on us.<br> Spying? I wasn't spying...<br> - You were.<br> You were peeking through the keyhole.<br> You were, because I saw you.<br> She's jealous.<br> You want him, but you won't get him.<br> Wait a minute.<br> - Wait for what?<br> More spying and double-crossing?<br> Let me go. Let me...<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Oh, Miss Brock.<br> - Dorothy...<br> You pushed me, didn't you?<br> Dorothy, what's the matter with you?<br> My ankle.<br> - What is it?<br> My ankle.<br> Get the house doctor right away.<br> - All right.<br> Please send the house doctor<br> to Miss Brock's apartment.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Get her shoes off, quick.<br> There, there, now.<br> Pat, it's swelling.<br> Answer the door, it's the doctor.<br> - All right.<br> You sent for me?<br> - Yes, doctor. Right in there.<br> Oh, doctor. It's her ankle.<br> - Which one?<br> A glass of water, please.<br> - Yes, doctor.<br> Is your name Denning?<br> I want to talk to you. Where is she?<br> She's had an accident.<br> - What?<br> She fell and twisted her ankle.<br> It may be a break.<br> What are you talking about?<br> How bad is it?<br> Can't tell definitely.<br> - Maybe it's only a sprain.<br> Looks like a fracture.<br> Can't tell till the x-rays are made.<br> Will she be able to go on tomorrow?<br> - Go on?<br> She's got the show tomorrow night.<br> - Not a chance.<br> She's got to. Do something, doctor.<br> Get her a pair of crutches.<br> Don't stand there gaping.<br> Oh, get out. Get out.<br> I still don't know why you're here.<br> - lf it was your business, I'd tell you.<br> A broken ankle, huh?<br> It's too bad it wasn't her neck.<br> May I have your attention?<br> Quiet, quiet.<br> - Quiet, please.<br> There'll be no performance tonight.<br> Wait a minute. Wait.<br> Our star, Miss Brock, has had<br> an accident. She's broken her ankle.<br> Don't leave the theater until<br> you're dismissed. Get that, Andy?<br> Hold the company here<br> for further instructions.<br> Stick around, everybody.<br> - Don't anybody leave the theater.<br> You gotta think of something, someone.<br> There must be some way out of this.<br> Dillon just phoned.<br> He's got everything fixed.<br> Up to and including Brock's ankle.<br> - No, he's going through with it.<br> He's going through with what?<br> He found someone to take Brock's place,<br> and he's on his way here with her now.<br> Where?<br> - I don't know.<br> Come on, Marsh.<br> No such luck.<br> Now, there's a Kiddie Kar<br> I could really go for.<br> Anytime Annie. Well, lay me low.<br> Your new leading lady, folks. I guess<br> I saved the day all right this time.<br> We'd better go in<br> and talk it over with Marsh.<br> You have a big investment in this show.<br> - You're telling him?<br> I appreciate your help,<br> but she won't do.<br> Sure. She didn't wanna do it at first,<br> but I convinced her.<br> She's all set.<br> Why, she'll be sensational.<br> How about letting me talk?<br> - All right.<br> Let's quit kidding, Mr. Marsh.<br> Abbie, all those things sounded swell<br> at breakfast...<br> ...but I can't carry this show.<br> I know that as well as you do.<br> I appreciate your honesty.<br> Swell, because you've got somebody<br> here who can carry your show.<br> A great little trouper.<br> Aren't I capable of selecting my own cast?<br> But you'd never pick her.<br> I say she can swing it.<br> How can you lose?<br> You gotta try her.<br> Who is she?<br> - Sawyer.<br> Yes, Peggy Sawyer.<br> She can dance rings around Brock.<br> Your show's half dancing.<br> She'd kill them.<br> Nobody ever heard of her.<br> She's a raw kid from the chorus.<br> Listen, I've been waiting years<br> for a chance like this...<br> ...and if I give it up to someone else,<br> believe me, she's gotta be good.<br> Send her in.<br> - Do you mean it?<br> Yes, send her in.<br> Mac.<br> Oh, Mac.<br> - Here.<br> Andy.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Get Sawyer.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> The boss wants to see you.<br> - Who, me?<br> Not your brother. Come on.<br> Lorraine, will you hold that?<br> - Go ahead.<br> Well, here she is.<br> Experience?<br> Just this show, Mr. Marsh.<br> You know the songs and dances?<br> Can you play the lead tonight?<br> The lead?<br> Sure, you can.<br> Don't let him scare you.<br> I'll give you a chance because I've got to.<br> Andy, send Jerry in.<br> I'll have a live leading lady<br> or a dead chorus girl.<br> Get out of here. I don't want<br> anybody in for the next five hours.<br> Good luck, honey.<br> - Come on, you.<br> Pick it up right after the number.<br> There's your cue. Speak.<br> Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.<br> It was grand of you to come.<br> No, it's impossible. Impossible.<br> You're greeting the man you love.<br> Your entrance speech.<br> Make it mean something.<br> Put feeling into it.<br> Listen, like this:<br> 'Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.<br> It was grand of you to come.'<br> Let me hear it.<br> Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.<br> It was grand of you to come.<br> No, it won't do.<br> Look, have you ever been in love?<br> Did you ever have a man hold you<br> in his arms and kiss you?<br> Now you're in the spirit of the thing.<br> You love this man.<br> Now, give it all you've got.<br> Let me hear it.<br> Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.<br> It was grand of you to come.<br> That's better.<br> Let me hear it from the beginning.<br> Go over there<br> and make your entrance again.<br> All right.<br> Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.<br> It was grand of you to come.<br> I can't. I can't...<br> Look here.<br> You can't, but you will.<br> Please, Mr. Marsh.<br> You want this chance or don't you?<br> All right. Let's try it again.<br> All right, it's fair, only fair.<br> Come in.<br> Only an hour before the curtain.<br> Okay, Jerry, that's all.<br> You let me down, Sawyer, and I'll...<br> Come on, lie down and relax.<br> The wardrobe woman will have to<br> come in to fit your costumes.<br> But rest all you can, because<br> you're definitely going on tonight.<br> Julian, how about it?<br> All right, the show goes on.<br> Wardrobe, everybody.<br> Everybody, makeup.<br> Oh, Billy.<br> - Hello.<br> I brought some coffee.<br> You can use a little, huh?<br> Oh, Billy, I'm so excited,<br> I think maybe I'm dreaming.<br> Oh, no, you're awake, all right.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> Billy, what's going to happen to me?<br> You'll be a hit. You'll be the<br> biggest thing that ever hit Broadway.<br> Oh, I hope so.<br> Say, I know so.<br> And I'm for you too. You know that.<br> Even if...<br> Even if what?<br> Oh, honey.<br> I've been for you ever since the day<br> you walked in on me in my BVDs.<br> I wanted to tell you, ever since<br> I first saw you, how I feel about you.<br> I don't know how to say it.<br> But you know what I mean, don't you?<br> I guess it does sound kind of<br> funny at that, the way I say it.<br> But the lines are new for me,<br> at least off-stage.<br> Well, I guess maybe I can read<br> between the lines, Billy...<br> ...but I wanna hear you say some more.<br> It was grand of you to come.<br> They told me I'd find you here.<br> - Miss Brock.<br> You can't talk to her, nobody can.<br> It's Marsh's orders.<br> I wanna see her alone.<br> I know, but...<br> It's all right, Billy.<br> So you're going to take my place.<br> I'm sorry, Miss Brock.<br> You're nervous, aren't you?<br> Well, don't be.<br> The customers out there want to like you.<br> Always remember that, kid.<br> I've learned it from experience.<br> And you've got so much to give them:<br> Youth and beauty and freshness.<br> Do you know your lines?<br> And your songs?<br> And your dance routine?<br> You're a cinch.<br> But it's tough on you, Miss Brock.<br> Come here.<br> Peggy, isn't it?<br> You know, Peggy, when I started<br> for the theater tonight...<br> ...I wanted to tear your hair out.<br> And then I started thinking.<br> Well, after all, I've had my chance.<br> And now it's your turn.<br> I've had enough.<br> For five years it's kept me away from<br> the only thing I ever wanted.<br> And a funny thing...<br> ...a broken ankle was the thing<br> that made me find it out.<br> You know, Peggy, most anyone can have<br> success with the proper breaks.<br> As for me...<br> ...I'll take Pat and vaudeville...<br> ...or whatever goes with him.<br> We're being married tomorrow.<br> I'm so glad.<br> Come in.<br> You've gotta hurry, miss.<br> Come right in, boys. Right over here.<br> Overture, places, girls.<br> I think it looks very nice now.<br> Do I look all right?<br> You look adorable.<br> Now, go out there and be so swell<br> that you'll make me hate you.<br> Thanks.<br> Remember, girls, I want<br> a straight line all the way through.<br> Marguerite, you're first.<br> Give me a big smile.<br> Get ready. All right, curtain.<br> Come on, all right. Get Sawyer.<br> When she comes out, I don't want<br> any of you to say a word to her.<br> Here she comes.<br> All right, break up.<br> Pay no attention to her.<br> Sawyer, you listen to me,<br> and you listen hard.<br> ...$200,000, five weeks of grind,<br> blood and sweat depend upon you.<br> The lives of these people<br> who've worked with you.<br> You've got to go on<br> and give and give and give.<br> They've got to like you, understand?<br> You can't fall down, because...<br> ...your future, my future<br> and all we have is staked on you.<br> Now I'm through.<br> Keep your feet on the ground,<br> your head on your shoulders...<br> ...and go out. Sawyer,<br> you're going out a youngster...<br> ...but you've got to come back a star.<br> There she is.<br> - There's your cue.<br> Good luck, honey.<br> Well, honey, we couldn't lose them,<br> and least of all, Jimmy.<br> Why, Jim, they didn't tell me you were here.<br> It was grand of you to come.<br> All aboard the Niagara Limited.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> That's your light change.<br> All right, snap into it. Hurry up, kids.<br> Get going. Take it away.<br> Break this up. Come here.<br> You got by, but you're not through yet.<br> The toughest part's coming.<br> Don't be a flash in the pan.<br> There isn't an actor here who doesn't<br> know what you're going through.<br> Now you gotta rest. Rest and relax.<br> Save it, because you're gonna need it.<br> I've been watching you for a couple weeks.<br> If you're nice to the right people,<br> you'll get along.<br> You know these routines?<br> - Quiet, please.<br> Mike, dim those first three borders,<br> will you? Hurry up.<br> Places, everybody, for the finale.<br> She's a hit, Abner. She's a hit.<br> Who's a hit?<br> Peggy Sawyer.<br> Did you do as I told you?<br> No, I didn't.<br> But I'll take her right out.<br> Come on, Fifi.<br> Well, hurry.<br> Directors make me sick. Take Marsh.<br> Name all over the program,<br> gets all the credit.<br> If it wasn't for Sawyer,<br> he wouldn't have a show.<br> She'll have Broadway<br> in her pocket in a week.<br> You're right.<br> - Marsh will say he discovered her.<br> Some guys get all the breaks.<br>
