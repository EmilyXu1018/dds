So much work to do.<br> Yeah, it'll be fine.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Thank you.<br> And I'm really over the moon<br> for both of you.<br> - Thank you, Mrs Mercer.<br> - Kate. Call me Kate.<br> We're not at school any more.<br> - Will do.<br> - (Chuckles)<br> (radio on in background)<br> What do you think of that Platters song?<br> - The what?<br> - The Platters song.<br> What for?<br> First dance.<br> Or think it's a bit naff to have<br> the same song we had at our wedding?<br> No. Lovely song.<br> - I've always liked it.<br> - Yeah, I know. (chuckles)<br> (radio continues in background)<br> (hums Smoke Gets In Your Eyes)<br> # Asked me how I knew #<br> # My true love was true #<br> - What is it?<br> - A letter.<br> Yes, I know, but who from?<br> - It's in German.<br> - Yeah.<br> What's it say?<br> Well, I can't remember the verbs<br> as well as the nouns, but...<br> but I think it says they've found her.<br> Found who?<br> Well, her body, anyway.<br> God, who? Geoff.<br> T-They've found Katya.<br> Oh.<br> Y-You know who I'm talking about,<br> don't you?<br> Of course.<br> Cos, I-I remember telling you,<br> clear as day.<br> Of course I remember.<br> I mean, it was a long time ago.<br> Yeah, I-I know I told you about my Katya.<br> She's been there over 50 years,<br> like something in the freezer.<br> Now they've found her.<br> L-Like that, er, Tollund Man<br> in the Swedish bog.<br> Well, Danish, actually.<br> - Hm?<br> - It was on the curriculum for years.<br> I taught it to the third-formers.<br> I'll make some more tea.<br> Yeah, I'm going to need a dictionary.<br> I-I don't know where to look.<br> Why don't you check in the plastic boxes?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing but "do-it-yourself" books.<br> Ah!<br> That's it.<br> Yeah.<br> Ah, thank you.<br> You see, what's happened is<br> the snow has completely melted.<br> All that's left is the ice.<br> A-And that's how they found her.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Well, she's still there.<br> - In the ice?<br> - Yeah.<br> Way down, I'm sure, but the water<br> is very pure up there.<br> It must be, so they can see her.<br> - Well, haven't they taken her out?<br> - Not yet.<br> Why not?<br> Well, she's in a glacier<br> in the Swiss mountains, Kate.<br> It can't be that easy.<br> There are no roads up there.<br> Hm.<br> So, how do they know it's her?<br> I mean, it might not be her at all.<br> Well, they've made an assumption, I<br> suppose, from where they found her.<br> Maybe they can tell<br> from what she's wearing.<br> From what she's wearing?<br> Oh, yeah, yeah, th-those, er,<br> airmen in... lceland, I-I think it was,<br> they were perfectly preserved.<br> Oh, I don't remember that.<br> Yes. I saw a documentary on it.<br> They were the same as when they died<br> because of how quickly they froze.<br> And you think that's what's happened?<br> Well, I don't know, but you can imagine.<br> Not sure it works like that.<br> Not after all this time.<br> How strange would that be, though?<br> She'll look like she did in 1962.<br> And I look like this.<br> (he sighs)<br> What is it?<br> Er, don't be cross, Kate.<br> I'm going to have a smoke.<br> (wind chimes)<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Fine.<br> Please eat this. And take your pills.<br> Th-They've asked<br> if I want to go to Switzerland.<br> Why would they ask that?<br> Well, to see the body.<br> - When?<br> - Soon, I suppose.<br> - You aren't thinking of going?<br> - Don't know.<br> (scoffs) All the way to Switzerland?<br> It's not that far.<br> There are flights from Stansted.<br> Yeah, but it's far enough.<br> - You don't think I should?<br> - Honestly?<br> Well, no.<br> I don't see the point.<br> - Plus we've got the party on Saturday.<br> - I wasn't thinking of going now.<br> - I-I wouldn't go now.<br> - Yeah, but still.<br> I don't like the idea of you climbing<br> a big bloody mountain.<br> Well, I don't think it would come to that.<br> You don't like going for a walk with me<br> on the Broads<br> - and that's as flat as a pancake.<br> - I know.<br> Like I said, Kate,<br> it wouldn't come to that.<br> But still...<br> - Don't you have to go into town?<br> - Oh, I can rearrange.<br> No, y-you should go.<br> It's been a bit of a shock, that's all.<br> But I'm fine.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yeah, positive.<br> (bell chimes)<br> Oh. It looks different, all empty.<br> Well, this is where the tables<br> are usually placed.<br> The top one over there,<br> so that everyone can see you.<br> We won't be having a top table,<br> but thank you.<br> Really?<br> A top table is so lovely<br> at an event like this.<br> The two of you as a focal point<br> of the room.<br> We're not trying to recreate the wedding.<br> It's just a party.<br> Yes, well, it's your choice, of course.<br> I will say, though, it's a wonderful<br> place, location-wise, for an anniversary.<br> It's your 40th, isn't it?<br> 45th.<br> That's an unusual one to celebrate.<br> My husband was ill and our 40th<br> was cancelled, so we had to rearrange.<br> Well, I must try and make this one<br> super-special, then, mustn't I?<br> And this really is a great venue<br> for such an event.<br> So full of history, you see?<br> Like a good marriage.<br> Did you know that the Trafalgar Ball<br> was held here?<br> Yes, your assistant told me.<br> It was in 1805.<br> Can you imagine<br> how incredible that must have been?<br> Everyone here, dressed in their finest,<br> celebrating such an achievement.<br> Wasn't Nelson killed?<br> But the battle was won.<br> And that has to be worth celebrating,<br> doesn't it?<br> We had a table at our wedding,<br> a top table, but we didn't like it at all.<br> My husband thought it<br> a horribly bourgeois tradition.<br> Shall we have a look at the canap list?<br> Er, yes, indeed.<br> I'll be right back.<br> No rush.<br> (choral singing in background)<br> (bells ringing)<br> (bell chimes)<br> (ringing tone)<br> You have reached Geoff and Kate.<br> Please leave a message.<br> # LEE HAZLEWOOD:<br> My Autumn's Done Come #<br> You haven't listened to this<br> for a long time.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - I'm fine.<br> What have you done to your finger?<br> Oh, yeah, I was, er... trying to mend the<br> lavatory and, er, well, I cut me thumb.<br> Ugh.<br> Did you manage to fix it?<br> It needs a new ballcock, I think.<br> - Tried calling earlier on.<br> - Did you leave a message?<br> No, I just wanted to check<br> you were all right.<br> Right.<br> - What are you reading?<br> - Kierkegaard.<br> Gracious,<br> are you having a go at that again?<br> You know, you have three editions<br> of that book,<br> and I don't think you've got past<br> chapter two in any of them.<br> Yeah, it's been an odd day.<br> It sure has.<br> I just, er... stayed at home,<br> you know, grappling with the ballcock.<br> But y-you're right.<br> I hardly go walking any more.<br> And it was a nice day, so off I went.<br> - So, where did you go?<br> - Just to the village.<br> To buy cigarettes?<br> (groans)<br> I haven't lost my sense of smell,<br> you know?<br> I just don't want us<br> to start smoking again.<br> No, I-I won't, I won't.<br> I promise.<br> OK. Go on.<br> So, I was in the village,<br> and I don't know what happened<br> but that racist<br> from the community centre...<br> Mm. Sandra Wilkins.<br> Yeah, her.<br> She came up to me, right up to me face,<br> and she kept asking me if I was all right.<br> And when I said I was,<br> she wouldn't believe me.<br> And... I wasn't doing anything.<br> Nothing. Just sitting on the bench<br> by the duck pond,<br> minding me own business<br> and getting some air.<br> All done.<br> All I was doing, I promise.<br> I believe you.<br> - (exhales heavily)<br> - She's a dreadful woman.<br> - Just ignore her.<br> - Mm.<br> (broadcast in background)<br> Is it all right?<br> Oh, it's great. Great.<br> Yeah. Mm.<br> A drop more?<br> Mm, thank you.<br> (broadcast in background)<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - There's something I want to tell you.<br> - OK.<br> You know, I-I feel sure<br> I've told you before,<br> but it was a long time ago,<br> so, I mean, I could be wrong.<br> - OK, go on.<br> - Yeah.<br> Um, I-I was her next of kin.<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, officially.<br> I-I was her next of kin.<br> I'm sure I told you this before, Kate.<br> I think I would remember my husband<br> being another woman's next of kin.<br> - Why?<br> - Why what?<br> Well, why were you her next of kin?<br> Because they thought we were married.<br> - Who did?<br> - The authorities. People.<br> What made them think that?<br> We-We told them we were.<br> You weren't, though?<br> Oh, no, no, no. No, h-hell, no.<br> We just had to pretend, so people<br> would let us stay in their houses.<br> Different in those days, Kate,<br> and then after the accident...<br> (mumbles)<br> You're not lying to me?<br> No. Kate, she wore a ring on her finger.<br> It was a small wooden ring,<br> like a curtain ring, made of oak.<br> Funny you'd remember that.<br> Well, it wasn't real.<br> (clears her throat)<br> OK, you could've...<br> you could've just told me, Geoff.<br> I thought I had.<br> If I hadn't, well, it's hardly, er...<br> the sort of thing you tell<br> your beautiful new girlfriend, is it?<br> I suppose not.<br> I think I'm going to have a...<br> go upstairs and have a bath.<br> I've got lots to do tomorrow.<br> - Are you sure you're all right?<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> Yeah, really, I am.<br> I can hardly be cross with something<br> that happened before we existed, can I?<br> Not really.<br> Still...<br> (sighs)<br> (clears her throat)<br> I suppose a cuddle's out of the question.<br> It doesn't even feel like it was me<br> that was there.<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> How long had you been up there?<br> Oh, six or seven weeks, I suppose.<br> It seemed a lot longer.<br> We had a map, er, to start with.<br> It was so bloody unreliable.<br> I've still got it somewhere.<br> Yeah, we were getting higher<br> into the mountains<br> and I decided it would be best<br> if we found someone,<br> y-you know, to help us<br> get to the Italian border.<br> - A guide?<br> - Yeah, wasn't really a guide.<br> This swarthy little bastard<br> who thought he was Jack Kerouac.<br> - (laughs) You always did hate Kerouac.<br> - Yes, I did.<br> Maybe you were jealous.<br> - What, of Jack Kerouac?<br> - Of the guide.<br> Was he flirting with her?<br> Well, they did have, er... the language.<br> My German, it wasn't that great,<br> what with its accent.<br> They laughed a lot.<br> He was forever making these jokes<br> I didn't get.<br> - Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> They were walking up ahead,<br> more than they needed to perhaps,<br> or... maybe I just let them, I don't know.<br> We were on a track round this rock,<br> and the glacier was on the right,<br> below us.<br> Way down.<br> Beautiful thing, it was.<br> You'd love the landscape out there, Kate.<br> - You really would.<br> - Yeah, I'm sure.<br> They were out of sight, round the corner,<br> and the last sound but one<br> that I heard was her laughter.<br> And, Christ, did it annoy me.<br> But then, there was a scream.<br> It wasn't a loud scream, neither.<br> Sort of outpouring of air from her lungs,<br> from the shock, I suppose.<br> It was low and guttural,<br> not like her voice,<br> which was soft, higher-pitched.<br> - (sighs)<br> - God, that's just horrible.<br> Mm. Mm.<br> And then what?<br> That was it, really.<br> When I got there, she'd gone.<br> And Kerouac was looking down this hole.<br> A fissure.<br> Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it,<br> like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.<br> D-Do you remember that one in Scotland?<br> - Yeah, I do.<br> - Yeah. Well, it was like that one.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Only much deeper.<br> And Kerouac was just standing there.<br> His face, oddly enough,<br> it looked almost yellow.<br> Was she blonde?<br> - Sorry?<br> - Did she have blonde hair?<br> Oh, no, no. She had dark hair.<br> - Like mine, then.<br> - Mm.<br> I mean, not now.<br> Yeah, like yours.<br> How old was she?<br> She was two years older than me,<br> and that was '62.<br> Yeah, so she was about 27.<br> Yeah.<br> My mum died that year.<br> - Did she?<br> - Yeah. Mm.<br> - I don't know why that's funny but it is.<br> - Funny?<br> Well, we didn't know each other then,<br> you and I,<br> but we were both going through something<br> really unpleasant, and...<br> and yet we never talked about it in all<br> the years that we've known each other.<br> - Never.<br> - No. Never have.<br> I'm tired.<br> Shall I turn off the light?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm quite tired, too.<br> (dog barks)<br> (barking continues)<br> Come on.<br> Max!<br> (barking)<br> Max!<br> Yeah, boy! Come on!<br> Come on! Good boy.<br> (radio on in background)<br> # DUSTY SPRINGFIELD:<br> I Only Want To Be With You #<br> You're up early this morning.<br> Yeah, I thought I might come into town<br> with you, if you don't mind.<br> No, of course I don't mind.<br> Yeah, I-I want to go to Thorns,<br> get a new ballcock.<br> Oh, good.<br> Do you think my library card<br> will still be valid, Kate?<br> - I don't see why not.<br> - I might pop in there if there's time.<br> Have a bit of a browse.<br> - We could have some lunch.<br> - Yeah, great.<br> Well, er, I'll just go do<br> what I have to do.<br> Give us a shout when you're ready.<br> OK.<br> About an hour. I've got to call<br> the florist and one or two things.<br> GEOFF: Do you think the library<br> will have anything on climate change?<br> KATE: On what?<br> - Climate change.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - All right.<br> - Did you get the thing?<br> - What thing?<br> - The ballcock.<br> - Er, they have to order it.<br> I'll pick it up in a few days.<br> What do you want to eat?<br> We've got to think a lot more<br> about the environment.<br> - Well, we recycle.<br> - Do we?<br> - Yeah. Well, I try to, anyway.<br> - Well, we should.<br> You're welcome to clean out the dog cans<br> and put them in the right bins.<br> Because these glaciers, they're melting<br> a lot more than people imagined,<br> - and the water's just not coming down.<br> - It's got to go somewhere.<br> No, it's saturating into the rock beneath,<br> and it's building up and up and up.<br> - L-Like...<br> - Like a dam.<br> Like a dam, yeah. It's waiting,<br> waiting, waiting, and then...<br> - (clatter)<br> - (Gasps) Oh.<br> (chuckles)<br> - Careful. No warning.<br> - (Phone rings)<br> Come down like a tsunami,<br> wipe out everything in its path.<br> Schools, churches, people in cafes<br> drinking their coffee,<br> old men in shops<br> tinkering with their cuckoo clocks.<br> And if they hadn't found her,<br> that's when she'd have come down,<br> with all the rock and debris.<br> We'll be long dead by then.<br> Oh.<br> Put your book away.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - You screening my calls, Kate?<br> - (Laughs) Not really.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> - Sally!<br> - Hi, Geoff.<br> That's my favourite one, there.<br> OK, Mum. I think it's enough now.<br> It's getting really boring.<br> - I'm proud of my grandson.<br> - Sally, I want to have a look at Charley.<br> - These are so lovely.<br> - (Chuckles)<br> And the photos are really beautiful.<br> - Aren't they?<br> - Sally's going to be a photographer.<br> I'm not. I'm just taking an evening<br> course, just for the fun of it.<br> It's nothing grand.<br> - But it might lead to something.<br> - Or it might not.<br> We shall see, won't we?<br> But you should concentrate on it.<br> I took it up about three months ago.<br> It's a good instrument to learn.<br> You can play anything on the ukulele.<br> It's not just George Formby, which is good<br> because, as you know, I always hated him.<br> The Internet is absolutely brilliant.<br> If you go to a guy<br> called justinguitars.com,<br> he actually teaches guitar,<br> but it's all free.<br> He's started, er,<br> teaching ukulele as well.<br> See you later. Have a nice time.<br> All right, see you later.<br> I don't think... I don't think<br> Geoff wanted to go to the pub.<br> It's either that<br> or he comes shopping with us.<br> We could have gone to the pub,<br> all of us.<br> Know what he's like with daytime drinking.<br> Oh, he'll be all right.<br> Anyway, it gives him a chance to vent.<br> - About what?<br> - About you.<br> Mum!<br> Not about you as such,<br> but about the party.<br> What do you mean about...<br> vent about the party?<br> When I think how awful George was<br> before our 40th,<br> I was that close to divorcing him.<br> Ignore her.<br> So, what's going to happen<br> with your dress? What would you like?<br> So, should I not be having a party?<br> Of course you should.<br> It is a lot of pressure for both of us.<br> And I hate parties anyway,<br> at the best of times.<br> I mean, I never even<br> celebrate my birthday.<br> No, no, no, no, no, you have to.<br> I mean, that's the strange thing.<br> George was awful, but then do you<br> remember him at the actual party?<br> How much he cried?<br> And not only during the speeches.<br> Yeah, he was very sweet.<br> That's why these things are important.<br> What, to make our husbands cry?<br> (chuckles) Not just husbands, all men.<br> It's always them that break first.<br> Sally's wedding, Charley's christening.<br> We hold it together cos we already<br> know how important these things are.<br> Geoff is not much of a crier.<br> I bet he cried at your wedding.<br> I don't remember.<br> If it's some twist of evolution<br> that needs men to be obsessed<br> by their obituaries, their legacies,<br> then maybe it's ours to nudge them<br> into realising what's really important<br> before they kill themselves,<br> you know, with the disappointment.<br> (violin music plays in background)<br> - Morning.<br> - Oh.<br> (chuckles) I nodded off.<br> What did you think of Sally's photos?<br> - Mm?<br> - Sally's photos.<br> I think she's got a very good eye.<br> Oh, sure. Yeah. Mm.<br> Mm.<br> I sometimes think it's a shame not to<br> have more photos around the house.<br> We could put some up.<br> Yeah, but we don't have any. Not really.<br> I mean, not like Lena does<br> with her wall display.<br> (groans)<br> (laughs)<br> (chuckles)<br> I suppose it's because they've got<br> children and grandchildren, and...<br> I guess we didn't see the point of<br> taking pictures of ourselves.<br> Would have been a bit vain.<br> You used to say that everybody<br> taking pictures all the time<br> stopped anyone having any fun.<br> - Did I?<br> - You did.<br> - Sounds like something I'd say.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> You had a camera, once.<br> - Yeah, a Yashica.<br> - Mm, a Yashica.<br> Yeah, I've still got it.<br> It's in the loft.<br> Now that we're older, though,<br> it... it's a shame.<br> What would you want photos of?<br> - Max when he was a pup.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Tessa before him.<br> You when you were decorating Clitheroe<br> and you hammered that nail into your hand.<br> You want a photograph of that?<br> Oh, you know what I mean.<br> It was our first house.<br> It was.<br> Yeah, it was my first home<br> since leaving home,<br> since leaving my parents,<br> leaving my father.<br> I suppose we don't realise at the time<br> but those memories...<br> ...they're the things, aren't they?<br> I'd want a picture of you<br> at the Leeds Mecca.<br> That's where we met.<br> You were a bloody knockout.<br> Oh, it's odd, isn't it,<br> - thinking of us back then?<br> - (Laughs)<br> I wasn't even 20, and you were so cool,<br> with your cigarette hanging in your mouth.<br> Mm.<br> (laughs)<br> Tell you what.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Come on.<br> - We can move the...<br> - Oh, bugger off!<br> Come on.<br> I'm not prancing around<br> in the living room at this time of night.<br> # LLOYD PRICE:<br> Stagger Lee #<br> (laughs)<br> # And the moon was yellow<br> # And the leaves came tumbling down #<br> # I was standing on the corner #<br> # When I heard my bulldog bark #<br> # He was barkin' at the two men<br> who were gamblin' in the dark #<br> # It was Stagger Lee and Billy #<br> - Over the top, yeah.<br> # Two men who gambled late #<br> # Stagger Lee threw seven #<br> # Billy swore that he threw eight #<br> # Stagger Lee told Billy #<br> # I can't let you go with that... #<br> (laughter and panting)<br> We ain't 20 any more.<br> No.<br> Let's go upstairs.<br> (mock growl)<br> Come on with ya.<br> - (clears her throat)<br> - Hope I can remember what you do.<br> I'll show you.<br> (chuckles)<br> - How are you doing down there?<br> - I think I'm ready.<br> Yeah?<br> - You don't want me to go on top?<br> - No, I'm nearly there.<br> Oh, you are, too.<br> Oh, there you go.<br> (laughs)<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Oh.<br> (both breathe heavily)<br> A kiss.<br> Open your eyes.<br> - Uh...<br> - Oh, shit.<br> (groans)<br> Oh, bugger.<br> - I think I've lost it.<br> - I...<br> OK, OK, OK.<br> - Geoff, it's OK, it's OK.<br> - (Sighs)<br> Hey.<br> - Aw...<br> - It's OK.<br> No, let's just go to sleep.<br> (clicks tongue)<br> (sighs)<br> (wind whistles)<br> (creaks and thuds)<br> (creaks and thuds)<br> (continued thuds)<br> Geoff?<br> What are you doing?<br> - Geoff?<br> - I'm OK, Kate.<br> Please come down. This is ridiculous.<br> I'm OK.<br> What's that in your hand?<br> Nothing.<br> - Is it her?<br> - I found it.<br> You didn't find it. You went looking<br> for it in the middle of the night<br> and that's not the same thing at all.<br> - Let me see it.<br> - No.<br> Please, Geoff. Can I see it?<br> Please, Kate, just go back to bed.<br> Show me the bloody picture!<br> It's just a picture. It's all it is.<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> It's just a fucking picture.<br> Thanks.<br> (Geoff sighs)<br> Max!<br> (Max barks)<br> Come on!<br> (Max barks)<br> (music from car)<br> Are you getting someone<br> to do your makeup on Saturday?<br> I wasn't thinking of it.<br> I know this girl. She's very subtle.<br> You wouldn't have to worry about<br> looking like a hooker.<br> (laughs)<br> Sally's got this amazing roll-on thing,<br> zaps away dark circles.<br> I'm sure you could borrow it.<br> If I'm looking tired,<br> you can just tell me.<br> You're looking tired.<br> I'm fine.<br> Ugh, this weather.<br> (sighs)<br> I'm just telling you what George said.<br> I'm not trying to upset you.<br> Really, I'm not.<br> I'm not upset,<br> but you're not telling me anything.<br> You're just saying that Geoff<br> was in a strange mood.<br> That's what George said.<br> Did Geoff say anything?<br> Like what?<br> That's what I'm asking you.<br> - About the party?<br> - No, not about the party.<br> (sighs) They were talking politics.<br> That's it?<br> Well, he was very aggressive.<br> Well, I'm sure George<br> can stand up for himself.<br> He was acting like he used to.<br> Meaning?<br> Like that time he kept accusing me<br> of being a fascist<br> in front of all my friends at my birthday<br> just because I dared to say that Thatcher<br> hadn't done such a bad job of it.<br> I mean, I hadn't even voted for her.<br> It wasn't funny, Kate.<br> No.<br> Very upsetting.<br> He kept doing a Nazi salute.<br> (both laugh)<br> All right, it was a little bit funny.<br> (sighs)<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I shouldn't have brought it up.<br> You know what Geoff's like.<br> He gets over-passionate about things.<br> I suppose that's why<br> you fell in love with him.<br> Yes.<br> # GARY PUCKETT AND THE UNION GAP:<br> Young Girl #<br> # Get out of my mind #<br> # My love for... #<br> - (Turns music off)<br> Oh, er, there's another thing.<br> What?<br> Geoff says he's not sure<br> that he wants to go to the works lunch.<br> At Crawley's?<br> - But it's tomorrow.<br> - I know.<br> And it's been organised for so long.<br> George was looking forward to<br> getting the old gang together but if...<br> Well, did he say why?<br> Don't think so.<br> I'll speak to him.<br> Er, maybe it doesn't matter.<br> No, I'll speak to him.<br> (chatter)<br> Ladies...<br> - Full, full?<br> - (Commentary in background)<br> LENA:<br> Do you want more milk?<br> - (overlapping voices)<br> - Yes.<br> Biscuit?
