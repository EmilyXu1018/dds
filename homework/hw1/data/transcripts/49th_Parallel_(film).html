With my gun at the back of his head?<br> - That makes no difference.<br> Do you want that noisy American butting in<br> and causing trouble? He's going to notify Winnipeg.<br> They'll have heard about our submarine being<br> bombed, and they'll put two and two together.<br> I'm right, Hirth.<br> They must play chess.<br> - [Radio: Beeping]<br> - [Radio: Russell] My move.<br> Pawn H-2 takes G-3<br> Pawn H-2 takes G-3.

See what you can find out.<br> Don't try to be too clever.<br> Keep as near to the truth as you can.<br> - [Vogel] Hello<br> - Hello.<br> - That's a good-looking scarecrow<br> - Mmm.<br> Why, you're only a kid.<br> I thought you were much older in that getup.<br> I'm 16. Are you looking for work?<br> Yes. How did you know?<br> You don't look like a hobo.<br> - Reaping started?<br> - Just begun.<br> - Are you on your own?<br> - Oh, those. Those are my pals.<br> - [Vogel] All right<br> - I thought they were your pals.<br> - Why?<br> - Seasonal workers always travel in gangs.<br> Well, these are my pals.<br> - This is ...<br> - Anna.<br> Anna. She's 16.<br> It isn't true. I shouldn't lie.<br> I shall be 16 the day after tomorrow.<br> Oh, it's only a difference<br> of two days.<br> Yes, but Peter says there's no difference at all<br> between a small lie and a big lie.<br> - Who is Peter?<br> - [Anna] Our leader<br> - Oh, so you have a leader.<br> - Yes, a wonderful leader<br> You'll meet him<br> Aren't you coming to the settlement?<br> There isn't another for eight miles.<br> I told her we were looking for work.<br> We should be glad to,<br> but, uh, there are four of us.<br> Don't worry. When 111 people sit down for supper,<br> four more won't make any difference.<br> [Lohrmann]<br> Did you say 111?<br> Hmm. What are you? Mormons?<br> Mormons?<br> No. Hutterites.<br> [Laughs]<br> I didn't mean we were all one family.<br> We're only brothers and sisters in God.<br> Hurry up, boy.<br> You are a slow boy.<br> Anna, more bread for our guests.<br> We're sorry about the bread.<br> Mmm. I know a bit about baking.<br> If you don't mind my saying so,<br> you ought to get a new baker.<br> We had a good one, but he went to Small Springs.<br> - Better pay?<br> - Oh, no one gets paid here.<br> - Doesn't anyone get paid anything?<br> - No.<br> Well, what do you work for, then?<br> Just your keep?<br> No. For us all.<br> What, all these people<br> work for nothing?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What sort of work?<br> Whatever suits them best.<br> Well, what do you mean?<br> They don't choose themselves, do they?<br> - Haven't you got a leader of the community?<br> - Yes. There he is over there.<br> Where? Which is your leader?<br> There. Third from the right.<br> Well, doesn't he tell the people<br> what sort of job they've got to do?<br> Oh, no. We tell him what we want to do.<br> Then how can he be your leader?<br> How do you mean?<br> Well, anyone works<br> at whatever job they like, then.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes.<br> If he wants to be a blacksmith,<br> he works in the forge.<br> If somebody feels he can preach,<br> well, he preaches.<br> Well, what's your specialty?<br> I'm... the baker.<br> When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg,<br> what happens to the money?<br> We buy new tractors, build houses,<br> found new settlements.<br> We just founded a new one over at Small Springs.<br> And if someone leaves you and then<br> wants to come back, don't you punish them?<br> - Punish?<br> - Yes. Don't you send them to a ...<br> - ... camp or something?<br> - Camp? Why a camp?<br> No, we just take them back<br> because our religion tells us to.<br> - The Hutterite religion?<br> - The Christian religion.<br> - ## [All Singing]<br> - Is it one of your rules to sing like this?<br> We haven't any rules. We sing because<br> we like to. It's good for the digestion.<br> ## [Singing continues]<br> Well, good night.<br> The leader will look after you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - What's the salute?<br> - The what?<br> - Don't you give the leader a salute?<br> [Chuckles]<br> - Good evening, friends.<br> - Good evening.<br> On behalf of my friends and myself,<br> I have to thank you for your...<br> - ... kindness in giving us food and shelter.<br> - You're welcome.<br> I hear you come from up north in the woods,<br> or down north, as we call it here.<br> Yes.<br> - Just come out?<br> - Last week.<br> Are you Germans?<br> I ask, are you Germans?<br> -Yes.<br> -Are you ashamed of it?<br> Of course not.<br> I'll show you where to sleep.<br> [Hirth] Thank you<br> [Man] Most of us are Germans<br> You may find some from the same part<br> of the old country as yourselves<br> Anna, I thought you would have<br> told them all about us.<br> [Vogel] We mostly discussed birthdays.<br> [Chuckles] Well, it's quite an event with us,<br> the 16th birthday.<br> It means that one has grown up at last.<br> Come in, please.<br> This house belonged to Hugo Waldner ...<br> ... one of our brothers<br> who has gone to the new settlement.<br> - At Small Springs?<br> - Yes.<br> You see, we are like bees.<br> If we get too many,<br> we send out a swarm.<br> So the house is empty<br> and at your service.<br> Good night.<br> - Sleep well.<br> - [Hirth] Good night<br> Hmm.<br> That's what I call a busy girl.<br> It's nothing.<br> I make 14 beds every night.<br> Hm. That's a lot of work.<br> You see, we have a lot of men who have no mothers<br> and who aren't married yet.<br> - So somebody has to make their beds.<br> - Quite right.<br> Two of you can sleep in here,<br> and there are two more beds in the other room<br> - Where do you sleep?<br> - In Peter's house.<br> - In Peter's house?<br> - But I don't make the bed for him<br> - Poor Peter. Why not?<br> - Because he has a mother to look after him.<br> [Vogel] Haven't you a mother?<br> No. She was drowned.<br> Drowned?<br> In the sea.<br> When we left Germany ...<br> ... we went to England ...<br> ... because we had to wait<br> until we got a permit to come to Canada.<br> We got our permit after war was declared.<br> - Was your father with you?<br> - Wait a minute.<br> I want to hear about her mother.<br> Her ship was sunk.<br> [Kranz] Torpedoed?<br> - I think so.<br> - Don't you know?<br> - Was there a big explosion?<br> - [Anna Whimpers]<br> Shut up, you two.<br> You and your questions.<br> Don't answer them, Anna<br> Oh, leave that.<br> - Run along now.<br> - I'll take her home.<br> All right, you take her.<br> - Good night, Anna.<br> - Good night.<br> Chins up.<br> [Hirth] Remember then, do nothing without orders<br> Discipline is more important<br> now than ever<br> So far, luck has been with us<br> It's a great stroke of fortune being here at all<br> - Do you think they are friendly, Herr Leutnant?<br> - Friendly? Yes.<br> But you saw how their leader tried to draw us out.<br> "Are you Germans?<br> Are you ashamed of being Germans?"<br> - That in a country with which we are at war.<br> - There can only be one answer to that.<br> Our agents have done their work well.<br> Yes. This religion may be<br> nothing but a cover.<br> I bet they sing the "Horst Wessel" song<br> better than hymns.<br> We shall see that tomorrow.<br> Heil Hitler.<br> Heil Hitler!<br> Shut the door.<br> Well, Vogel, who knows?<br> Perhaps one day the story of our adventures<br> will all be written in a book.<br> In a few years time, it may be the basis<br> of compulsory lectures to the Hitler Youth.<br> The ships we sank, with women and children aboard ...<br> ... the lifeboats we shelled.<br> Mmm, we were good at that.<br> What we did to the Eskimos<br> at the post ...<br> ... the unarmed men we shot in the back.<br> You forget, Vogel, we're at war.<br> We can't expect to win<br> without the methods of total warfare.<br> Men, women and children they're all<br> our enemies and must be treated as such.<br> Did you never read what Bismarck said?<br> "Leave them only their eyes to weep with."<br> "Leave them only their eyes to weep with."<br> Did he say that?<br> Those were his actual words in the war of 1870.<br> You should study Bismarck.<br> He was a great German.<br> A great German.<br> You know, Vogel,<br> I'm worried about you.<br> You're a good fellow,<br> but you don't discipline yourself.<br> You give way to emotions<br> That'll land you in trouble one of these days.<br> Why don't you take an example from Kranz,<br> a fine, soldierly fellow.<br> You could be just as good a Nazi as he is<br> if you tried.<br> - Are you listening, Vogel?<br> - Yes, Herr Leutnant.<br> - Then think it over.<br> - Yes, Herr Leutnant.<br> - And get out of bed and turn out the light.<br> - Yes, Herr Leutnant.<br> [Sighs]<br> Vogel, I ...<br> [Snoring]<br> - Herr Leutnant?<br> - Either of you seen Vogel?<br> - No, Herr Leutnant<br> - Well, get dressed at once.<br> - [Woman] Good morning, friend.<br> - Good morning.<br> He's asking for you.<br> Oh? All right.<br> Well? Aren't you going?<br> Well, I can't go till I've got this lot ready.<br> What shall I tell him?<br> I'll be along in a minute.<br> [Chattering]<br> [Man] Now, where's this new baker<br> I hear about, eh?<br> Ah.<br> Now, that's what I call bread.<br> - [All Murmuring Agreement]<br> - [Man] You'll have to teach David the trick<br> [David] Trick or no trick,<br> I could never make bread as good as that<br> Cheer up, David.<br> It took me seven years.<br> - Why ever did you want to give it up?<br> - I didn't want to give it up. I had to.<br> - You see, we all had ...<br> - [Door Slams]<br> [Man] Peter! Just come and look at this bread!<br> Good morning, friend.<br> Mr. Vogel is the best baker<br> we've had here in 15 years.<br> I can't imagine<br> why his last boss let him go.<br> Must have been crazy.<br> If he wasn't then, he is now.<br> Congratulations, Vogel.<br> It was a good idea.<br> Round the barn!<br> What's the news in Winnipeg?<br> The market was good for geese.<br> People are asking for Hutterite geese.<br> I don't like that, Andreas.<br> No?<br> For 300 years our brethren<br> have wandered from place to place ...<br> ... from country to country...<br> ... because of the jealousy of others.<br> This is a good country, Andreas.<br> - I met Frau Habermann.<br> - Yes? Oh, her trial was on today, wasn't it?<br> Her husband and her eldest son, Eric,<br> are to be interned. She is free.<br> Bad luck ...<br> ... just at harvest time.<br> It wasn't a good day for the trial.<br> Papers are full of stories about those Germans<br> who landed from a U-boat down north.<br> They seem to have acted like wild beasts,<br> killing and stealing.<br> - What's Frau Habermann going to do?<br> - I had a talk with her.<br> - She needs help on the farm.<br> - It'll be difficult.<br> We'll talk it over. Tell the others<br> we'll have a meeting tonight, yes?<br> [Exhales]<br> Air's heavy.<br> I'm afraid we're going to<br> have a storm tonight.<br> Sorry. Sorry I'm late, Peter.<br> Barbarina, there's an electric storm<br> playing all around us ...<br> ... frightening the animals<br> and your chickens.<br> - Move over, Philip.<br> - What about you, Anna?<br> - Andreas.<br> - Huh?<br> - One of our guests is speaking.<br> - Eh? What? Oh! Good!<br> We're discussing the Habermanns.<br> I was about to say ...<br> ... you have one clear choice.<br> Where there is a question of blood ...<br> ... where one is governed<br> by the deepest of racial instincts ...<br> ... then every other consideration<br> is swept aside.<br> Men like yourself ...<br> German, or of German ancestry ...<br> ... rise up with all the might and power<br> of the great German people behind you ...<br> ... conscious of the sacred duty<br> that binds us all together ...<br> ... and in the knowledge that he<br> who doesn't forget his people ...<br> ... will not by his people be forgotten.<br> There is a new wind blowing from the east ...<br> ... a great storm coming across the sea ...<br> ... a hurricane which will sweep aside<br> all the old, outmoded ways of life ...<br> ... and mark the beginning of a new order,<br> not only for Europe ...<br> ... but for the whole world.<br> Let those beware who would have<br> the temerity to stand in its way.<br> They will go down<br> before its irresistible impulse ...<br> ... and be crushed out of existence!<br> But for those who accept the new order<br> or those who perhaps belong to it already ...<br> ... why need I use<br> these parables of speech any longer?<br> I mean, all of you here tonight ...<br> ... yes, you, brothers ...<br> I call you brothers<br> and proudly acknowledge you as such.<br> You who formed a little stronghold<br> of our people here in Canada ...<br> ... you will have your share<br> of the happiness and prosperity ...<br> ... that is waiting for us all<br> when the storm is over and the sun rises ...<br> ... that mighty sun ...<br> ... which will give us<br> everything we need in life.<br> What sun are you talking about, friend?<br> I am talking of the greatest idea in history ...<br> ... the supremacy of the Nordic race,<br> the German people.<br> I am talking of the being whose name<br> I am certain lives in every heart ...<br> ... whose name hangs on all our lips ...<br> ... whether we can shout it to the world<br> or only whisper it in one another's ears.<br> Germans!<br> Brothers!<br> I ask you to join with me<br> in paying homage to our glorious Fhrer.<br> Heil Hitler!<br> [Kranz, Lohrmann] Heil Hitler!<br> [Thunder Rumbling]<br> I don't ask where you come from<br> or what brought you here ...<br> ... although you've left us<br> in no doubt as to your beliefs.<br> Someone has given you,<br> no doubt deliberately ...<br> ... a completely false impression of us.<br> We are only one amongst<br> many foreign settlements in Canada.<br> There are thousands of them<br> in this part of the world.<br> And they have been founded,<br> some recently, some 80 years ago ...<br> ... by people who left their homes<br> in Europe because of famine ...<br> ... because of starvation ...<br> ... because of racial<br> and political persecution ...<br> ... and some, like ourselves,<br> because of their faith.<br> Some came only to find new land ...<br> ... new boundaries, a new world ...<br> But all have found here in Canada ...<br> ... the security ...<br> ... the peace and tolerance<br> and understanding ...<br> ... which, in Europe...<br> ... it is your Fhrer's pride<br> to have stamped out.<br> You call us Germans.<br> You call us brothers.<br> Yes. Most of us are Germans.<br> Our names are German.<br> Our tongue is German.<br> Our old handwritten books<br> are in German script.<br> But we are not your brothers.<br> Our Germany is dead.<br> However hard this may be<br> for some of us older people ...<br> ... it's a blessing for our children.<br> Our children grew up against<br> new backgrounds, new horizons.<br> And they are free ...<br> ... free to grow up as children ...<br> ... free to run and to laugh<br> without being forced into uniforms ...<br> ... without being forced to march<br> up and down the streets ...<br> ... singing battle songs.<br> You talk about a new order in Europe.<br> The new order ...<br> ... where there will not be one corner ...<br> ... not a hole big enough for a mouse ...<br> ... where a decent man can breathe freely.<br> You think we hate you, but we don't.<br> It is against our faith to hate.<br> We only hate the power of evil<br> which is spreading over the world.<br> You and your Hitlerism ...<br> ... are like the microbes<br> of some filthy disease ...<br> ... filled with a longing<br> to multiply yourselves ...<br> ... until you destroy everything<br> healthy in the world.<br> No.<br> We are not your brothers.<br> What do you want?<br> I am come to tell you that<br> you can make your own beds.<br> I don't want to work for you.<br> [Vogel] That's all right, Anna Run along now.<br> You're Nazis, aren't you?<br> Aren't you?<br> We're not allowed to hate anybody.<br> But I hate you.<br> I believed you'd escaped<br> from an internment camp.<br> I should tell the police about you.<br> You killed my father ...<br> ... because he said your Fhrer was the Antichrist.<br> You drowned my mother.<br> I hate you.<br> I hate you!<br> So you're going to tell<br> the police about us, are you?<br> Little girls should be seen and not heard.<br> - That will do.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - That will do!<br> - Vogel.<br> Come along, Anna. I'll take you home.<br> - Herr Leutnant, we can't let them go.<br> - I'd like to see what you're going to do about it.<br> - Vogel!<br> - Yes, Herr Leutnant.<br> Have you forgotten who you are?<br> - No, Herr Leutnant.<br> - Let the girl go and shut the door.<br> I'll take her home, Herr Leutnant.<br> [Door Closes]<br> Is that you, Anna?<br> Yes, Peter.<br> I brought Anna home.<br> She's all right.<br> We're going now, perhaps in a few minutes.<br> I only wanted to say that<br> you've been kind and I like it here.<br> You like my bread,<br> and I like the way you live.<br> Being with you has made me feel<br> like it used to be at home.<br> I'd almost forgotten what it was like ...<br> ... baking bread, doing my real work.<br> That's how it used to be seven years ago<br> before everything changed.<br> The life I've been living<br> seems to have no sense in it now.<br> Well, I'd better go now.<br> Please don't go.<br> - Are they still talking?<br> - Hush, child. Go to sleep.<br> How can a man like you, Vogel ...<br> I mean, you're a simple, good human being.<br> How can you get mixed up<br> with such a lot of gangsters?<br> What can you do?<br> When you're a boy,<br> you like playing soldiers.<br> When you're a young man, you can't<br> get work unless you belong to them.<br> When you're an old man,<br> you're anxious not to lose what you've got.<br> But there are thousands<br> of men like you, Vogel ...<br> ... men who don't like<br> the way things are going.<br> I suppose so.<br> I suppose they don't know themselves.<br> I didn't know.<br> It's as if a blind man said<br> he doesn't know the sun shines.<br> - I suppose so.<br> - Why don't you stay with us, Vogel?<br> - Do you mean it?<br> - Of course I mean it.<br> Even if you know who I am ...<br> - ... where I come from<br> - I don't care who you are or where you come from.<br> - I know you.<br> - Thank you, Peter.<br> - It will mean internment.<br> - What's it matter?<br> I'll come back after the war.<br> This is your home.<br> ## [Whistling]<br> ## [Whistling Continues]<br> ## [Whistling Continues]<br> - [Hirth] Engine Room Artificer Vogel<br> - ## [Stops]<br> You are under arrest.<br> You are accused of desertion<br> and treachery to the Third Reich.<br> In the absence of<br> a properly constituted court ...<br> ...

No, we sleep tonight<br> in the railway station.<br> Tomorrow we'll catch a bus<br> outside the city limits, then walk.<br> He wanted us to fly to Vancouver.<br> Said it would save a lot of time.<br> - [Chuckling] What did you say, Herr Leutnant?<br> - I said we had plenty of time.<br> [Horn Honking]<br> [Vehicle Approaching]<br> [Horn Honking]<br> [Spits]<br> - [Vehicles Passing]<br> - [Horn Honking]<br> [Train Whistle Blowing]<br> Those are the Three Sisters Mountains.<br> We're in the park now, Banff National Park<br> Today's Indian Day.<br> It's the biggest crowd of the year.<br> There will be thousands of Indians.<br> You should stop over and see it.<br> I have an appointment in Vancouver.<br> You say these three men were here?<br> Well, they were right here.<br> - Can you describe them?<br> - Well, let me see, now.<br> There's only one that<br> I would remember right well.<br> Corporal!<br> Ladies and gentlemen.<br> [Man] Norman, I'm going to use<br> your mike to talk to the crowd<br> Attention please.<br> The mounted police have reason<br> to suspect that among this crowd ...<br> ... are three enemies of this country.<br> They are not ordinary aliens,<br> escaped from Kananaskis Internment Camp.<br> They are survivors<br> from a German submarine ...<br> ... the notorious U-37, which was sunk<br> in Hudson Bay by our air force.<br> These men are here in this courtyard<br> They may be standing right next to you<br> Each one of you, look closely at your neighbour.<br> These are descriptions of the three men.<br> One, who appears to be the leader ...<br> ... is a well-built man of medium height.<br> He has very definite features,<br> a commanding manner ...<br> ... is clean-shaven, brown hair.<br> He wears a blue suit and tan shoes.<br> ... and carries himself<br> as if he'd been drilled.<br> There is no very good description<br> of the second man.<br> He is thin and inconspicuous in his manner.<br> He wears a suit of some light colour ...<br> ... and a hat tilted over his eyes.<br> He may be carrying a bulky rucksack.<br> The third man is short and dark.<br> He wears no hat.<br> He has a tweed jacket and a bow tie.<br> He carries a parcel wrapped<br> in oilcloth and tied with thick string.<br> He is described as being<br> nervous in his manner.<br> I must ask all of you to stay<br> exactly where you are ...<br> ... and not talk or move.<br> All of you, as citizens, can help<br> to bring these men to justice.<br> Each one of you, look closely at your neighbour.<br> Remember, each one of these men<br> has every reason to be afraid.<br> They've already been responsible<br> for the deaths of 11 defenceless people.<br> Sooner or later,<br> their nerves will crack<br> Look closely at your neighbour<br> - Corporal, there's your man!<br> - [Clamouring]<br> [Clamouring continues]<br> Herr Leutnant, it's a trail.<br> Hmm, come on then.<br> Lost?<br> - Yes.<br> - That's a difficult trail on foot in those outfits.<br> - You walked in from the lodge, I suppose<br> - Yes.<br> - Any plans?<br> - Plans?<br> Well, it'll be dark in an hour.<br> The moon doesn't rise till 11:00.<br> A lot of grizzlies on that trail.<br> - Grizzlies?<br> - Grizzly bears. Touchy beasts.<br> You wouldn't like 'em.<br> [Chuckles]<br> And they wouldn't like you.<br> I see.<br> - [Metal Clanging]<br> - Ah, dinner. You're just in time.<br> George will be pleased.<br> [Speaking Foreign Language]<br> Tricky things, aren't they?<br> The great thing is just to sit still.<br> - On holiday here?<br> - Yes, on holiday.<br> How do you find the lodge?<br> They used to do you a very good<br> lobster thermidor with a red Bordeaux.<br> They still do you a lobster,<br> but no more red Bordeaux.<br> - A nuisance, isn't it?<br> - Hmm?<br> The war, I ...<br> Anyhow, up here in the Rockies ...<br> ... the war seems so remote,<br> one can't take it so seriously.<br> Of course one knows one half of humanity<br> is trying to wipe out the other half, but ...<br> ... up here among the mountains<br> and the spruce forests ...<br> ... one sees it in perspective.<br> So that it ...<br> it seems almost unimportant.<br> You've chosen a very beautiful place for your holiday.<br> Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it?<br> Actually, I'm here to work ... on a book.<br> - Oh, so you're a novelist?<br> - [Chuckling] Well, I write books.<br> My specialty is Indians. This has been<br> a hunting ground of theirs for generations.<br> Then I ... I suppose<br> you were at Banff today.<br> For Indian Day? No, no, no.<br> That's just for tourists.<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> Ship ahoy!<br> Well, gentlemen.<br> Welcome to my humble tepee.<br> Got two this time, George<br> I'm improving.<br> And tell Bob two more for dinner. Well.<br> It must be very pleasant<br> roughing it up here in the mountains.<br> Yes, I rather like pigging it occasionally.<br> I hope you won't mind taking potluck with me.<br> Here, have a cigarette.<br> Ah, I see you're looking at my Picasso.<br> Nice, isn't it?<br> Here.<br> How do you feel about Matisse?<br> I picked these up about a year ago,<br> and I can't bear to be parted from them.<br> How do you like it, hmm?<br> - Excellent.<br> - [Chuckles]<br> I don't think you two are<br> really interested in pictures.<br> Well, my motto is,<br> wars may come and wars may go ...<br> ... but art goes on forever.<br> Ah, you like reading, don't you?<br> Have you seen Hemingway's latest?<br> Here. I'm going to show you one of my pets.<br> There. Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain<br> This is the German edition.<br> [Chuckling]<br> This is wonderful stuff.<br> [Reading In German]<br> By the way, do you speak German?<br> Have you read this book?<br> Thomas Mann is very good, I believe.<br> I'm so sorry. Of course,<br> you'll want a bath after your long climb.<br> I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower.<br> Come on. I'll show you the way.<br> - Thank you very much, Mr ...<br> - Scott.<br> Philip Armstrong Scott. Come on.<br> Philip Armstrong Scott.<br> Ah, hot water.<br> I feel completely confident tonight.<br> If we'd twice as far to go,<br> I wouldn't worry now.<br> What could these<br> weaklings ever do to us?<br> The man's country's at war<br> and look at him.<br> I tell you, Lohrmann, they're rotten to the core.<br> There's no fight in them.<br> They're soft and degenerate all through.<br> No, I'll have cold.<br> [Gasps]<br> [Scott] George, the fire's smoking.<br> South-southeast by south<br> Ah, that's the ticket<br> Yes, I've discovered some rather<br> amusing things during my researches.<br> Blackfoot tribal customs,<br> for instance, closely resemble those ...<br> ... of a certain modern European tribe.<br> I'm going to read you something about that.<br> Where are we?<br> "From the earliest age, their small boys<br> were trained in the arts of war ...<br> "... which they considered to be<br> the only pursuit worthy of a man.<br> "But they preferred to attack<br> by night, rather than by day ...<br> "... and wherever possible,<br> to shoot the enemy in the back.<br> "Their smaller neighbours lived<br> in constant danger from them.<br> "They also believed in first<br> terrorising their opponent ...<br> "... by covering themselves in war paint<br> and beating loudly on their tribal drums."<br> Well, doesn't that sound familiar to you?<br> Familiar?<br> - I don't quite understand.<br> - Well, what price Goebbels, eh?<br> - Very similar.<br> - Yeah, you see, don't you?<br> And listen to this.<br> This is wonderful.<br> Come here, sit down.<br> Ahh ... oh, yes.<br> "When a tribal leader really<br> desired to drive a point home ...<br> "... he used that most terrible of all<br> public speaker's weapons: Repetition ...<br> "... constant and unutterably<br> wearisome repetition."<br> Old man Hitler himself.<br> ## [Harmonica]<br> ## [Continues]<br> - What's wrong?<br> - I think he found it a little warm in here.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> - Well, rather stuffy in there, eh?<br> - A little.<br> Lovely night, isn't it? The moon's just out.<br> - [Laughing]<br> - We're not the only ones up, I see.<br> - The men, eh?<br> - When do they go to bed?<br> Oh, pretty early as a rule.<br> They please themselves.<br> You must be rather tired yourself.<br> How about a nightcap before you turn in?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Yes.<br> Well. Interested?<br> Have a drink?<br> [Chuckles]<br> ##[Stops]<br> Well, happy dreams.<br> [Shudders]<br> [Spits]<br> [Man] Okay<br> Ah, I thought you'd find it a bit chilly.<br> We're 6,000 feet up here, you know?<br> - So you think you'll escape the war, Mr. Scott?<br> - Hmm?<br> - That's not a very nice way of putting it.<br> - But you'll do your best to escape it.<br> Do you mean I'm ...<br> I wonder if I am.<br> I don't think I'm a coward.<br> I've never really been in any great danger.<br> I don't exactly know how I'd behave.<br> - I can imagine how you'd behave.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> I said, "I can imagine how you'd behave."<br> [Chuckles] Hmpf. Well, you are an extraordinary fellow.<br> You're certainly frank.<br> So you despise my mode of life, eh?<br> Well, I'm getting some revelations tonight.<br> Maybe it'll do me good.<br> Maybe I'm becoming a little smug.<br> I imagined you'd been thinking,<br> "Here's a nice, decent sort of chap.<br> "Invites me to dinner<br> when he doesn't even know me.<br> Amiable.<br> Full of interesting conversation."<br> And instead of that,<br> you think I'm ...<br> Go on, what do you think I am?<br> This ought to be enlightening.<br> If you were a real man, you'd have struck me<br> across the face when I suggested you were a coward.<br> Instead of which, you talk about it.<br> Well, why not?<br> I may write about the customs<br> of red Indians 200 years ago ...<br> ... but I don't have to behave like one.<br> After all, we've been given<br> reasoning powers and the gift of speech.<br> Why don't we use them<br> instead of hitting each other?<br> Come on, have a cigarette.<br> I don't think you're even a coward.<br> I don't think you're a man at all.<br> You must've had too much to drink.<br> You both better get to bed.<br> Is this gun loaded?<br> Of course it's loaded.<br> Then put your hands up.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - It's quite plain. Put them up.<br> Well, well, well.<br> This is a new experience.<br> So I've been entertaining gangsters.<br> Well, what do you want?<br> Money or what?<br> You don't believe we'd shoot you, do you?<br> Such a thing couldn't happen<br> to Mr. Philip Armstrong Scott.<br> Anything unpleasant must be<br> kept as far away as possible ...<br> ... as far as the war, 5,000 miles away.<br> Suppose I was to tell you that<br> the war is right here in this tent?<br> I don't suppose you've heard of the U-boat<br> that was sunk in Hudson Bay ...<br> ... and the six Germans who escaped.<br> So that's who you are Nazis.<br> Well, that explains everything.<br> Your arrogance, your stupidity, your ...<br> - ... bad manners<br> - Get over there by your books!<br> Oh, dear. Do I have to be tied up?<br> Excuse us, Mr. Scott.<br> We still employ savage, tribal methods.<br> They get results.<br> The best thing that's happened to us is meeting you.<br> Youve put the heart back into us.<br> There are only two of us now.<br> Two out of six brave men.<br> There are millions like us in Germany.<br> Any more of your sort here, you don't stand<br> a chance of an English war. Well see to that.<br> - Get the clothes out of there.<br> - They won't suit you.<br> Not much there, I'm afraid.<br> - Thirty-three dollars.<br> - Do I get a receipt?<br> There's only one suit here<br> You better have the overcoat.<br> Interesting.<br> So far, I don't feel the least afraid.<br> No sign of trembling.<br> Pulse appears to be quite steady.<br> Mouth a bit dry perhaps.<br> Here. Rifles.<br> Ah, you feel happier now, don't you?<br> Look out.<br> Wars may come and wars may go,<br> but art goes on forever, eh?<br> Stop!<br> Thomas Mann.<br> Yes, I have read this book.<br> We kicked this swine<br> out of the Reich years ago.<br> There's something else too<br> "Blackfoot Tribal Customs"<br> Think yourself lucky we don't burn you too.<br> Well, I never would've believed<br> that grown-up men ...<br> ... could behave like spiteful little schoolboys.<br> Have I said something to annoy you?<br> Then, I forget, anything reasonable annoys you.<br> - Open your mouth.<br> - One question, please.<br> When Hitler's making a speech,<br> just exactly what are your reac...<br> Damn them horses.

In the cave?<br> - [George Grunts]<br> What are we waiting for?<br> Let's get him.<br> - Which one of them two is it, Boss?<br> - I don't know. Did you see, George?<br> All right, George?<br> I forgot to tell you, Art.<br> He's got my Colt, too.<br> See that hole?<br> That's gonna cost him seven bucks<br> before I let the Mounties get him.<br> That means he's got four shots left.<br> All right, Bob I'll take over now.<br> Okay, Boss, but I don't think<br> you ought to take any ...<br> - The papers say these men are killers.<br> - Yes, the Canadian papers.<br> The Nazi papers call them heroes.<br> Two brave Nazis against 11 million Canadians.<br> Say, Mr Scott.<br> Mr Scott.<br> - Stop him<br> - [Gunshot]<br> One.<br> - [Gunshot]<br> - Two.<br> - [Gunshot]<br> - Three.<br> - [Gunshot]<br> - Four.<br> That's the lot.<br> - Oh, it's you.

Let me have a look at that.<br> The boss has knocked him cold.<br> Well, he had a fair chance.<br> One armed superman ...<br> ... against one unarmed decadent democrat.<br> I wonder how Dr Goebbels will explain that.<br> "Leutnant Hirth ...<br> "... wherever you may be<br> on the North American continent ...<br> "...

He's important.<br> The whole German nation is waiting<br> to see if he can get away with it.<br> - I know. I read the papers.<br> - Hey, couldn't we sort of ... you know?<br> - You mean?<br> - Yeah.<br> - No.<br> - By your own law, you must take me to my consul.<br> Sometimes I think we got too many laws.<br> - Don't let him pull that law stuff!<br> - You know better than that, soldier.<br> I'm a Customs Inspector.<br> This is for the Immigration Department.<br> My job's inspecting and checking<br> on freights and imports.<br> Listen, Captain. What would you do<br> if he were an illegal shipment of ... cheese?<br> Return him. But he's a human being.<br> - At least he's a Nazi.<br> - He's not on the manifest, is he?<br> - What?<br> - I said, "He's not on the manifest."<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> No, he's not.<br> - The American law ...<br> - Aw, shut up.<br> I know the law.<br> It says, "Imports are not admissible<br> unless properly manifested"<br> I find two items not listed.<br> - How do you check?<br> - Same way. Two unlisted items.<br> But your law refers to freight, not to persons.<br> This is a freight car, and you're freight.<br> - Tell the engineer to return this car.<br> - Okay.<br> Phone those Canucks and tell 'em it's coming<br> with two items missing from the manifest.<br> - Tell 'em to either list 'em or take 'em off<br> - Check.<br> Thanks, Colonel. Thanks a million.<br> We've all got to do our duty, soldier.<br> - I'll send your gun back to the Mounties.<br> - Okay. I don't need it.<br> But I protest. You cannot do this.<br> It's illegal.<br> Sonny boy, I've done it.<br> Hello, Macaulay? It's Eddie speakin'.<br> We're sendin' back car number 8772.<br> Gee, you guys are gettin' careless.<br> There's two items not in the manifest.<br> - Now, either list 'em or take 'em off.<br> - [Train Whistle Blows]<br> [Engine Starts]<br> Put 'em up, Nazi.<br> No, not that way.
