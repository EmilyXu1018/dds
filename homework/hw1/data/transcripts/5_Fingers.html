                        On October 18, 1950...<br> ...a member of the<br> British Parliament...<br> ...addressed a question to<br> the Foreign Secretary.<br> This book purports to be a<br> true account of espionage...<br> ...written by a former<br> German military attach...<br> ...it reveals the most<br> astonishing details of a case...<br> ...occurred within His Majesty's<br> Embassy in Turkey in 1944...<br> ...and in which hundreds<br> of top secrets...<br> ...including plans for the invasion...<br> ...of Normandy were stolen and<br> transmitted to the Germans.<br> Has an inquiry into these<br> fantastic charges taken place?<br> Measures have been<br> taken to prevent any...<br> ...future lapse in security.<br> However, it must be regretfully<br> admitted that, in substance...<br> ...the story to which the Honourable<br> Member refers, is a true one.<br> To be exact, our story<br> began on March 4, 1944.<br> It was a day<br> of gruelling fighting...<br> ...in the Second World War;...<br> ...but the sun was shining<br> serenely on neutral Turkey.<br> The very same evening,<br> on March 4, 1944...<br> ...a Turkish minister held a<br> reception for the diplomatic corps.<br> The place, Ankara, the<br> capital of neutral Turkey.<br> If Excellency will excuse me, I<br> have suddenly acquired a headache.<br> I've had mine for some time.<br> Perhaps from standing too much?<br> From listening too much.<br> Wagner makes me ill.<br> Herr von Papen, I hope your<br> country appreciates you.<br> You are the only unpredictable<br> German I have ever met.<br> I cannot remember when I've seen<br> a lady as beautiful as you...<br> ...eat as heartily as you.<br> Just a little more<br> of the salad, please.<br> No one admires Turkish<br> food more than I.<br> Still, the prospect of dining from<br> a buffet at a diplomatic reception...<br> The number of actual<br> dinners I eat these days...<br> ...is equal to the number of<br> receptions to which I am invited.<br> Champagne?<br> - I have beer, thank you.<br> I have often wondered, Countess.<br> Why did you leave Warsaw?<br> Bombs were falling.<br> I felt I was in the way.<br> Then why did you come here?<br> You and your late husband...<br> ...had lived so long in England,<br> you had friends there.<br> Being bombed in London is not...<br> ...more attractive than<br> being bombed in Warsaw.<br> But you could have returned<br> to your own country, France.<br> As the impoverished widow of<br> a pro-German Polish count?<br> It would have required<br> courage. I have none.<br> You could have counted<br> upon our protection.<br> I understand you are now<br> protecting my estates...<br> ...and all of my possessions<br> in Poland.<br> Who has them?<br> Field Marshal Goering. I believe.<br> Bon appetite, madame.<br> As always, I have enjoyed it.<br> Herr von Papen.<br> - Yes?<br> Herr von Papen, I need money.<br> These must be difficult<br> times for you, I know.<br> Please don't be diplomatic for<br> just a moment. You can help me.<br> Nothing would please<br> me more, if I can.<br> I want back what belongs to me.<br> Unfortunately, there is a war.<br> - After the war.<br> I can give you every assurance.<br> But in the meantime, I can be of<br> service to you, to Germany...<br> ...if I can prove my worth.<br> Afterwards it would be easier.<br> How would you go proving it?<br> Loan me the means to live<br> again here in Ankara.<br> Advance it to me. I can more<br> than make it worth your while.<br> You, of all men, must know<br> what a fund of knowledge...<br> ...a clever hostess can became.<br> - Countess Staviska...<br> ...are you suggesting that the German<br> Government set you up as a spy?<br> I am suggesting that<br> I can earn my keep.<br> It's a sordid, unrewarding business.<br> Sordid but not unrewarding.<br> In terms of money, perhaps.<br> What other terms are there?<br> I'm sorry. I'm afraid<br> it's quite impossible.<br> What am I going to do, then?<br> Call upon your friends.<br> I have none that I want.<br> And those who want to be<br> quite frankly cannot afford it.<br> I beg you pardon.<br> - Yes?<br> Excellence, the British<br> Ambassador had just driven up.<br> So soon?<br> Perhaps we can talk longer<br> at the next reception, madam...<br> ...and it's my turn to arrive for<br> the last half of the evening.<br> One thing about being a neutral.<br> I can come early and stay late.<br> And perhaps continue our talk<br> with the British Ambassador?<br> Herr Moyzisch, do not look at me<br> as if you had a source of income...<br> ...other than your salary.<br> Excellence.<br> - Yes?<br> The Countess Staviska.<br> - What about her?<br> I based upon something<br> she said to me...<br> ...I have reason to believe<br> she needs money.<br> You, too, Moyzisch?<br> I assure you that it wasn't I,<br> Excellence, who approached her.<br> However, it occurred to me...<br> - No.<br> She has many friends,<br> access to many sources.<br> Definitely not. Goodnight, Moyzisch.<br> - Goodnight, Excellence.<br> Don't shout. Take me to your office.<br> - What do you want?<br> Let's get out of this light.<br> Don't be a fool, Moyzisch.<br> This is the opportunity<br> of your lifetime.<br> Choose right now...<br> ...you can be the envy of the<br> German Foreign Service...<br> ...or you can go through<br> life as a diplomatic valet.<br> After all, what if I were a thief?<br> What could I steal from you?<br> First, let me warn<br> you not to breathe...<br> ...a word of it to anyone<br> but your chief.<br> My life will depend<br> upon your discretion.<br> A responsibility I do not<br> choose to accept.<br> You have no choice. Your<br> life will depend upon it, too.<br> State your proposition.<br> - Very well.<br> Certain British documents<br> classified as Most Secret...<br> ...have come into my possession.<br> Military and political documents of<br> utmost value to your government.<br> I am prepared to sell them.<br> The price is 20,000 pounds.<br> English pounds sterling.<br> I am a spy, obviously.<br> And your life work is espionage?<br> Not exactly.<br> But I have spent a lot of my<br> life preparing for this day.<br> No spy in history has ever been<br> paid 20,000 pound for any information.<br> No spy in history has had<br> to sell what I have to sell.<br> Besides, spies are notoriously<br> poor businessmen.<br> They are patriots, frustrated<br> liberals or victims of blackmail...<br> ...whose emotional<br> involvement weakens...<br> ...their bargaining position and<br> destroys sound business judgements.<br> Would you consider it sound business<br> for the German Government...<br> ...to pay 20,000 pounds<br> to an unidentified amateur...<br> ...for a set of so-called<br> 'secret' documents?<br> Not so-called. Not secret.<br> Most secret. Top secret.<br> I am sure they are.<br> And now I have more<br> serious matters to attend to.<br> I'll have an attendant show you out.<br> Moyzisch.<br> It appears I must think<br> for both of us.<br> Inform von Papen of my offer.<br> Naturally, he'll check with Berlin.<br> I'll give you 3 days to<br> consider my proposition.<br> On March, 7, at three<br> in the afternoon...<br> ...I'll telephone you and ask if<br> you've received a letter for me.<br> I'll call myself Pierre.<br> If you say no, you'll<br> never see me again.<br> If you say yes, it'll mean<br> you have accepted my offer.<br> But I must have more information.<br> - Lf you accept...<br> ...I'll return at ten<br> o'clock that evening.<br> You'll then receive two rolls of film,<br> with photographs of the documents.<br> I will receive from you the<br> sum of 20,000 pounds...<br> ...in English bank notes<br> of small denominations.<br> Should you approve<br> of my first delivery...<br> ...you can have more.<br> For each subsequent film the<br> price will be 15,000 pounds.<br> Is this all clear?<br> - It is not at all clear.<br> What are the documents?<br> What do they contain?<br> I hadn't thought to bring samples<br> with me. But, for one thing...<br> ...the Turks are considering...<br> ...entering the war.<br> - A matter of pure supposition.<br> I have the minutes of their talks.<br> Von Papen would be enlightened...<br> ...and frightened.<br> - What else?<br> The latest Allied time-table of the<br> shuttle-bombing of Balkan targets.<br> Where, when, by whom<br> and by how many.<br> The minutes of the Teheran Conference.<br> - What else?<br> Don't be greedy. What do you<br> expect for 20,000 pounds?<br> How did you obtain such information?<br> That is not concern of<br> yours. Nor is my identity.<br> And please do not have me followed.<br> You have no talent for it...<br> ...you keep getting ahead<br> of those you follow.<br> Destiny has held out its<br> hand to you tonight.<br> Take it and hold on.<br> Goodnight, Moyzisch.<br> Good evening, Diello.<br> - A pleasant reception, sir?<br> Diplomatic receptions<br> are never pleasant.<br> Necessary or not necessary<br> successful and unsuccessful...<br> ...or non-committal.<br> The faces may be pleasant, but...<br> ...never the motives.<br> - Let me help you, sir.<br> Speaking of pleasant faces...<br> ...weren't you in the service<br> of the Countess Staviska?<br> I was valet to her late husband...<br> ...when he was attached<br> to the Polish Embassy.<br> She was at the reception this evening.<br> I hadn't seen her for years.<br> Is she well, sir?<br> - As charming as ever...<br> ...but not well off.<br> It seems that the Nazis have<br> confiscated all of her possessions.<br> I'm sorry to hear it. She<br> was a lady of great wealth.<br> It was becoming to her,<br> she used it well.<br> A generous and brilliant hostess,<br> the Countess Staviska.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - More than anyone I've ever known.<br> She symbolized the world in which<br> she lived, and which she loved.<br> A world of infinite beauty,<br> luxury and indulgence.<br> Those were pleasant days, sir.<br> Gone forever, I'm afraid.<br> Let us hope not, sir.<br> I put the Turkish survey...<br> ...and your journal, beside your bed.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> - One moment, sir, your capsule.<br> Have you considered the possibility<br> that you might, just once...<br> ...forget something?<br> - Often, sir.<br> I don't think you'd ever get over it.<br> Nor do I, sir.<br> Goodnight, Diello.<br> - Goodnight, your Excellency.<br> The dispatch from Berlin<br> has just arrived.<br> 'Transaction approved.<br> Take every precaution.<br> Essential you determine<br> identity of agent.<br> Expect immediate report after<br> delivery of documents.'<br> Signed Kaltenbrunner.<br> What does he mean, sir,<br> by take every precaution?<br> You're not to hand over the money...<br> ...until you have developed<br> the films, examined them...<br> ...and decided whether they<br> are genuine and worth it.<br> That's quite a responsibility.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> The money arrived by courier<br> from Berlin this morning.<br> I have not taken any of it, Moyzisch.<br> You can count it in your office.<br> Yes, sir. I had no intention,<br> believe me, it...<br> Can you handle this alone?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What about developing the films?<br> Photography's a hobby of mine.<br> I have used the dark room often.<br> Good. The fewer people who<br> know about this the better.<br> Particularly if he makes fools of us.<br> Personally...<br> ...I sense something bogus<br> about the whole affair.<br> The man may be a clever swindler...<br> ...perhaps even a British agent trying<br> to plant false information on us.<br> What was your impression of him?<br> Well, sir, I'd pick him to be a<br> highly trained special agent...<br> ...a foreign office career man.<br> British, of course.<br> An Oxford-bred aristocrat<br> if ever I saw one.<br> You know the type, sir...<br> ...arrogant, spoiled, cynical<br> and completely decadent.<br> Fantastic.<br> By the way, a code name<br> has been assigned to him...<br> ...'Cicero'.<br> He is to be referred to as Cicero.<br> - Cicero?<br> The name is the personal<br> choice of Herr Ribbentrop.<br> Has it any significance, sir?<br> - None that I know of.<br> Except the surprising fact that Herr<br> Ribbentrop has ever heard of Cicero.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - That's all, Moyzisch. Good luck.<br> And keep your wits sharp.<br> A great deal depends on you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I forgot the money.<br> You have the money, I see.<br> - You have the film?<br> Fetch me a drink while<br> I count it, will you?<br> Scotch whiskey. I'm sure<br> that you must have some.<br> Thank you.<br> One of the pleasures of<br> duty in neutral country...<br> ...you Germans can drink<br> fine Scotch whiskey...<br> ...and your enemies can<br> fill up on fine German beer.<br> - The film.<br> Not yet. You must wait until<br> I have developed the film.<br> It will take only a few minutes.<br> Those are my orders.<br> If you insist, just this once.<br> Will you develop the film yourself?<br> - Yes.<br> Then you'd better drink this.<br> You're trembling like a butterfly.<br> It'll help steady your wings.<br> The door will be locked.<br> I won't open it to anyone but you.<br> 'Turkish government ready to offer...<br> ...full support short<br> of entering war...<br> ...as open co-belligerent.'<br> Open up. Moyzisch.<br> Interesting snapshots, aren't they?<br> The documents seems to be genuine.<br> Don't be pompous, Moyzisch.<br> My government has authorized me to<br> make further arrangements with you.<br> Have you informed them of<br> the price? 15,000 pounds...<br> ...for each additional roll of film.<br> How did...<br> - I said to myself...<br> ...if I were an attach<br> in a German Embassy...<br> ...what combination would I use?<br> - How dare you?<br> I imagine that would open<br> half the safes in Germany...<br> ...and Hitler's birthday<br> the other half.<br> What an unimaginative lot you are.<br> Don't be upset. There wasn't<br> anything else worth taking.<br> My government is prepared to pay<br> We won't haggle, Moyzisch. I risk<br> my life to get these documents.<br> is quite reasonable. You'll pay it.<br> But under one condition.<br> My superiors insist...<br> ...on knowing who you are and<br> how you obtain your information.<br> Why?<br> - Because...<br> ...it's irregular having an agent in<br> our employ about whom we know nothing.<br> I am not an agent in your employ.<br> Understand that clearly.<br> All the same. It's essential<br> that we know...<br> It's unessential that you<br> know anything about me.<br> I will tell you this much.<br> I work at the British Embassy.<br> Sooner or later you'll find that<br> out, anyway. As to my name...<br> You have been assigned<br> a code name, Cicero.<br> Cicero. A man of nobility,<br> eloquence...<br> ...and dissatisfaction.<br> I like that name.<br> - When will you bring more film?<br> A week from tonight, at the same<br> hour. And have the money ready.<br> Moyzisch, change the<br> combination for the safe.<br> May I suggest one? Try 6-18-15.<br> That's the date of the Battle<br> of Waterloo. Goodnight.<br> It's you, Diello.<br> - Do I disturb you, madam?<br> Not at all. It's always<br> a pleasure to see you.<br> Come in.<br> Take your coat off, sit<br> down and gossip with me.<br> I have a dinner engagement...<br> ...but he's an undersecretary<br> and used to waiting.<br> Any particular undersecretary, madam?<br> Undersecretaries are<br> never particular, Diello.<br> Perhaps that's why<br> they take me to dinner.<br> It is far more likely that,<br> in madam's presence...<br> ...they feel like ambassadors.<br> Of all the diplomats I've<br> known, you're still the best.<br> It is my fortune that you've<br> known so few valets.<br> Diello, please. I've spoken<br> to you about this before.<br> You're the valet to the British<br> Ambassador, not to me.<br> Now, sit down and tell me the gossip.<br> Well, to begin with, the noses of the<br> wives of the Diplomatic Corps...<br> ...Axis, Allied and Neutral...<br> ...have been badly out<br> of joint this past week.<br> Due to?<br> - Due to the ease with which the...<br> ...Countess Staviska once more<br> proved herself the most radiant...<br> ...beautiful, and sought<br> after lady in Ankara...<br> ...at last week's reception.<br> - Another of your unverified rumours.<br> I was afraid madam would<br> accuse me unjustly.<br> I'm prepared to name my authority.<br> - Who?<br> The British Ambassador, no less.<br> He spoke of your<br> beauty and brilliance...<br> ...and hospitality, of how,<br> in the old days...<br> ...you were a symbol of<br> everything worth having.<br> A symbol of the good<br> all days. That's me.<br> The last of the lot.<br> If I'm lucky I'll get a thousand lira.<br> Diello, will you take it to the<br> pawn shop for me tomorrow?<br> I couldn't face the<br> haggling and whining.<br> Perhaps it would be pleasant<br> for you to go tomorrow...<br> ...and bring back<br> the jewels you redeem.<br> I don't understand, redeem?<br> It's yours. 5,000 pounds.<br> It's from me.<br> From you? Is it a joke?<br> It can't be real.<br> There is nothing as real as money.<br> But Diello, I don't know when<br> I could pay this back to you.<br> I don't want it back.<br> But I can't permit you to, why it<br> must be the savings of a lifetime.<br> They're not my savings.<br> I'm not a saving man.<br> You must know a...<br> ...business venture of mine<br> has paid off handsomely.<br> And gives promise of<br> far greater profits to come.<br> And what has it to do with me?<br> I propose to advance you these 5,000<br> pounds in return for certain favours.<br> This particular enterprise<br> must remain highly confidential.<br> Anyone knows nothing about it...<br> ...except my business<br> associates and you.<br> Profits will be exceedingly large.<br> I couldn't keep such<br> sums at the Embassy...<br> ...nor do I want to draw attention<br> to myself by depositing in a bank.<br> But you could keep it for me.<br> Well? Go on.<br> You could leave this grubby room...<br> ...rent an attractive house, live as<br> you please, entertain as you please.<br> And how would all that<br> be a favour to you?<br> From time to time I shall want to<br> transact my business in privacy.<br> Naturally, I shall continue<br> to live at the Embassy...<br> ...but you would set<br> aside quarters for me.<br> I see.<br> If all goes well, I shall have some<br> I have set that as my goal.<br> - And then?<br> Then South America.<br> To a new life. A new name.<br> That will require certain<br> papers of identity;...<br> ...a passport, visas,<br> letters of credit.<br> You could be of great help<br> in obtain such documents.<br> How?<br> - I'll explain that later.<br> Is there anything else?<br> - Nothing.<br> It seems little enough to<br> ask for 5,000 pounds.<br> Are you going to tell me<br> what your business is?<br> Sometime, perhaps. Not now.<br> This is quite a trust you put in me.<br> If I were to be indiscreet...<br> ...I could ruin everything for you.<br> - And for you, too.<br> You seem very sure of yourself.<br> - I'm sure of you.<br> For three years I was a valet<br> to the late Count Staviska.<br> It is said that no man is<br> a hero to his valet.<br> It is also true that no woman is a<br> mystery to her husband's valet.<br> You know me that well?<br> - Well enough.<br> The source of your money<br> concerns you as the...<br> ...source of the electricity...<br> ...they became worrisome<br> only when they were shut off.<br> Quite true. But there's pride.<br> I have pride.<br> A great deal.<br> I depend upon your pride.<br> You'd find it intolerable to<br> have it known that your wealth...<br> ...was the gift of a servant.<br> Madam, you'll keep<br> your mouth shut tight.<br> Get me a brandy.<br> I shall drink only out of<br> one glass, thank you.<br> Diello...<br> ...do you know why I discharged<br> you after my husband died?<br> You said you'd be travelling<br> and wouldn't need a servant.<br> That was a lie.<br> Yes, it was. I let you go because<br> you made me uneasy.<br> Your were much too<br> clever for a servant...<br> ...too suave, too wise,<br> too self-contained.<br> I was almost afraid of you.<br> I felt you had an evil<br> genius for something.<br> Little did I know it was a<br> genius for making money.<br> That is a lie too. That wasn't<br> why I made you uneasy.<br> No?<br> - No.<br> You were attracted to me and upset<br> to feel that way about a valet...<br> ...and to feel that the valet knew it.<br> Anna, have I offended you?<br> - You'll soon be very rich.<br> 'Everything worth having.'<br> He didn't say that about you.<br> I did. That's how I've<br> always thought about you.<br> And now you want me to go<br> with you to South America.<br> Yes.<br> - To a new life.<br> Yes.<br> - Away from the wars, the intrigues...<br> ...the fears.<br> - The poverty.<br> And it would be right for us, now...<br> ...because now, now at last...<br> ...we are equals.<br> - Yes.<br> Where are you going?<br> Madam has a dinner engagement.<br> We have run out of gossip.<br> I shall cancel the dinner.<br> And we can talk business.<br> You made me a business proposition,<br> I agree to that part of it.<br> As for the rest of the proposition<br> is not an impossibility.<br> It's merely an improbability and,<br> above all, an impertinence.<br> Because I addressed you as an equal?<br> No, because you addressed<br> me as a servant.<br> Because in the manner<br> of an inferior...<br> ...you tried to buy something you<br> didn't think you merited on your own.<br> Now let's get down to<br> the details of business.<br> As madam wishes.<br> - My name is Anna.<br> Yes, Anna.<br> reached Gestapo headquarters...<br> ...Moyzisch was summoned to Berlin<br> to report to General Kaltenbrunner.<br> Incredible! You have the negatives?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Give them to Colonel von Richter.<br> Too good to be true. 25 Top secret<br> documents from an unknown agent.<br> This has all the earmarks<br> of a British trap.<br> Sir.<br> - Yes?<br> Ambassador von Papen<br> thinks that in his opinion...<br> ...the documents are genuine.<br> I'm not interested in his opinion.<br> I want facts, proof, conclusive proof.<br> What's the real identity of Cicero?<br> What are his motives...<br> ...besides money?<br> Does he have a partner?<br> You haven't answered<br> any of these questions.<br> Cicero is most uncooperative.<br> Teach him to cooperate.<br> That's your job.<br> What do you think of the information<br> on the Teheran Conference?<br> It looks authentic. But it's<br> such high-level material that...<br> ...we have no means of verifying it.<br> - Exactly.<br> And we can't act on<br> what we can't confirm.<br> But there's one document here<br> that can be confirmed. This.<br> The operational plan of the<br> shuttle-bombing of Balkan targets.<br> British heavies<br> are going to bomb the...<br> ...Ploesti oil fields on April, 5. If<br> the raid takes place on schedule...<br> ...that would confirm the authenticity<br> of the other documents.<br> Good point.<br> Is it your intention, sir,<br> to warn the Rumanians?<br> Of course, not, what<br> purpose would that serve?<br> When will you see Cicero?<br> Next Thursday evening.<br> - Very well.<br> Fly back to Ankara and<br> keep the appointment.<br> Try to get some facts on him.<br> Tell him we can't pay out...<br> ...such sums unless we know<br> how he gets his information.<br> I'll do my best, sir.<br> Try to do better than that.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> This is your responsibility,<br> Moyzisch. I warn you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Half-witted paranoid gangsters!<br> Refusing to warn the Rumanians...<br> ...thousands of dead...<br> ...millions of gallons of precious<br> oil and gasoline gone...<br> ...because they will not admit that<br> anything in the world is genuine!<br> The air raid will convince them.<br> Even if it does, now<br> they can't admit it.<br> But if Ribbentrop found out<br> Kaltenbrunner made a mistake...<br> ...and Goebbels found<br> out about Ribbentrop...<br> ...and Himmler found<br> out about Goebbels...<br> It's time you understood...<br> ...we represent a government<br> of juvenile delinquents!<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Well...<br> ...if Berlin doesn't know how to<br> utilize Cicero, I most certainly do.<br> What about the Turkish Premier?<br> His Excellency will be unable<br> to see you this evening.<br> He's attending a reception.<br> - What reception?<br> At the Countess Staviska, I believe.<br> At the Countess Staviska?<br> - I shall be there myself.<br> What's all this about?<br> You were invited, but you declined.<br> - So I did.<br> I didn't realize.<br> The Countess has found<br> a benefactor after all.<br> I wonder who.<br> - No, sir. Not on my income.<br> This could only happen in Ankara.<br> And only to the Countess Staviska.<br> Last month penniless...<br> ...this month the Turkish Foreign<br> Office supplies her guest of honour.<br> Call the Countess. Say I find<br> myself free this evening after all...<br> ...and would be delighted to attend.<br> Yes?<br> - You'll have to wake Morrison.<br> Ask him to come at once.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Will you change, sir?<br> What? Thank you, Diello.<br> Morrison will be there directly.<br> - Thank you.<br> Turn on that lamp, will you, Diello?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> This bulb must be burned<br> out, sir. I'll have it replaced.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Morrison, sorry to waken you.<br> Get this dispatch off to<br> Whitehall at once.<br> Have this coded and classified<br> as most secret:<br> ...'Upon representation from<br> Turkish Foreign Office...<br> ...there is strong reason<br> to believe...<br> Diello, will you shut<br> the door, please?<br> ...there is strong reason to believe<br> that von Papen is in possession...<br> ...of top secret information...<br> ...which would indicate a<br> leak in security here... '<br> Upon receipt of this highly<br> classified message...<br> ...the Foreign Office in London<br> took immediate action.<br> Let me read you what we received<br> from Ankara early this morning.<br> 'Upon representation from<br> Turkish Foreign Office...<br> ...there is reason to believe<br> von Papen is in possession...<br> ...of top secret information, which<br> would indicate a leak in security...<br> ...or Nazi access<br> to secret documents...<br> ...or possibility have broken<br> British cipher... '<br> Colin Travers, a special agent<br> of British Counter Intelligence...<br> ...left London by plane next<br> morning, bound for Istanbul.<br> Colonel von Richter of the Gestapo<br> Counter Espionage Service...<br> ...left Berlin by plane<br> the same day.<br> Travers and Colonel von Richter<br> arrived Istanbul the same evening...<br> ...and boarded<br> the Anatolian Express.<br> They reached Ankara next morning.<br> Von Richter carried<br> a Swiss passport...<br> ...identifying him as<br> Herr Rudolph Hodler...<br> ...a tobacco buyer from<br> Berne, Switzerland.<br> He was met at station by a<br> Gestapo agent named Siebert...<br> ...and escorted to the German<br> Embassy to confer with von Papen.<br> Travers was greeted outside<br> the station by Keith McFadden...<br> ...a British agent attached<br> to the Embassy in Ankara.<br> McFadden?<br> - Glad to see you, Captain.<br> They left without delay to meet<br> with the British Ambassador.<br> To begin with, sir, I think we<br> must assume that the source...<br> ...of information to the Nazis is<br> someone here at the Embassy.<br> It's been ruled out...<br> - Our personnel and permanent...<br> ...employees have had previous<br> security clearance from London.<br> I've never known a self-respecting<br> spy without a security clearance.<br> Where is classified information kept?<br> Here in my safe. And<br> in the first secretary's.<br> And the code room?<br> - Under guard, day and night.<br> Don't you think it most likely<br> that this lapse in security...<br> ...was due to a slip of the lip<br> at some party or reception?<br> My lips are not in the habit<br> of slipping, Mr. Travers.<br> Nor do I imply that they are. But our<br> material passes trough other hands...<br> ...and might pass through other lips.<br> Now McFadden was telling me<br> about an unattached lady...<br> ...a certain Countess Staviska.<br> Thank you, Diello. You were saying?<br> A certain Countess Staviska.<br> It seems she has quite recently<br> and suddenly begun to entertain.<br> Informal, gay little gatherings.<br> I assume some of our Embassy<br> personnel have attended.<br> The Countess has a wide circle<br> of friends which includes me.<br> That circle would also include<br> Herr von Papen and his associates.<br> Mr. Travers, the Countess<br> is doing her very best...<br> ...to live neutrally in<br> a neutral country.<br> The circumstances...<br> - Mac says...<br> ...her circumstances have taken a<br> startling change for the better.<br> Does anyone know the<br> source of her fortune?<br> It concerns anyone but<br> the Countess Staviska.<br> I cannot see what the<br> source of her income...<br> ...has to do with our problem.<br> Now I'm probably<br> just a gossip at heart.<br> Maybe that's why I like my work.<br> Counter-espionage is the<br> highest form of gossip.<br> Obviously Cicero is paying<br> the bills for the Countess.<br> Why would he choose her villa for<br> his next rendezvous with Moyzisch?<br> What a strange, and sudden,<br> and perfect relationship.<br> Too strange, too sudden<br> and too perfect.<br> The unknown Cicero and the<br> well known Countess...<br> ...well known for her<br> anti-German sentiments.<br> Yet only recently she pleaded<br> with me personally...<br> ...for an opportunity to<br> work in our interest.<br> At the suggestion of British<br> Intelligence, no doubt.<br> Colonel von Richter, just<br> what will convince you...<br> ...that Cicero is what<br> he says he is, a spy...<br> ...selling us genuine<br> documents of great value...<br> ...for a great sum of money?<br> I have come here to convince<br> myself one way or the other.<br> A talk with Cicero might help.<br> Moyzisch, when do you meet him next?<br> In the villa, next Thursday evening.<br> Then you will arrange for Mr. Hodler,<br> a Swiss business man to be present.<br> My incognito.<br> I think it's preferable that Moyzisch<br> remain our only contact with Cicero.<br> I'm afraid you do not understand<br> why I am here, Excellence.<br> I've come to Ankara to<br> relieve you of all...<br> ...the responsibility in<br> our relations with Cicero.<br> I cannot be relieved<br> of that responsibility...<br> ...except by the order<br> of Herr Ribbentrop.<br> Kaltenbrunner hopes he won't be<br> forced to by-pass Ribbentrop...<br> ...and bring the matter to the Fuhrer.<br> What further instruction<br> has the Gestapo for me?<br> All documents from Cicero<br> will be sent directly to Berlin.<br> Those which are pertinent<br> to your diplomatic mission...<br> ...will be then transmitted to you.<br> Moyzisch, do what you can...<br> ...to make the Colonel's stay<br> in Ankara a comfortable one.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, I call him out. Yes, of course.<br> Monsieur Hodler...<br> ...there's a gentleman who<br> wishes to see you privately.<br> You had a business<br> appointment, I believe?<br> I believe so.<br> - I'll take you to him.<br> I am indebted to Herr Moyzisch for<br> suggesting that I ask you to our...<br> ...musical evening.<br> - The honour is mine, Madame.<br> I hope you haven't found<br> it too subdued.<br> On the contrary, it's been exactly<br> as I would have wished it.<br> Had you known Herr Moyzisch long?<br> We have been business<br> associates for some time.<br> Are you, too, a diplomat,<br> Monsieur Hodler?<br> I suppose you could call<br> me a middle man.<br> There are so many Swiss middle men.<br> It must be a national occupation.<br> It is natural.<br> After all, we Swiss have been in<br> the middle for hundreds of years.<br> Come in.<br> I'll see that you're not disturbed.<br> Colonel von Richter? Sit down, please.<br> Moyzisch tells me you'll<br> be the new intermediary.<br> That's correct.<br> Sent by Kaltenbrunner, I should<br> imagine to it that von Papen...<br> ...keeps his hands off the<br> information I supply.<br> Havana's, the finest money can buy.<br> I approve of the change. Moyzisch is<br> conscientious but not very bright...<br> ...and to well known here. It will<br> be safer for me to deal with you.<br> Your security is a matter<br> of grave concern to us.<br> I'm happy to hear it.<br> I share your concern.<br> For this reason I must<br> ask about the Countess.<br> Have you tell her who I am?<br> - Of course not.<br> Or the nature of your business?<br> - No.<br> Then just what is her relation?<br> - My dear Colonel...<br> ...I did not invite you to<br> discuss my private affairs.<br> We've some business to transact.<br> Did you bring the money?<br> As always, you will be paid<br> after we have developed the film.<br> During the past six weeks I have<br> sold Moyzisch fifty photographs...<br> ...all of genuine secret documents.<br> That's proof enough of my good faith.<br> Henceforth, you will pay<br> on delivery. The money?<br> Possibly you are no longer<br> interested in the plans of the...<br> ...Allies for the entire<br> Mediterranean area.<br> You mean a second front?<br> I do not know the number of the front.<br> I do know that in these document<br> Mr. Churchill keeps referring...<br> ...to the 'soft underbelly of Europe.'<br> I could take the films to<br> von Papen and ask that he...<br> ...query the German High<br> Command as to their interest.<br> Very well.<br> Why, you had it with you all the time.<br> Who are you, anyway?<br> Would you believe me<br> if I told you I was...<br> ...valet to the British Ambassador?<br> Certainly not.<br> - You see?<br> Then at least satisfy my personal<br> curiosity on one point.<br> Why are you selling us information?<br> - That was self-evident, for money.<br> You must have some other motive.<br> Perhaps you share our disgust<br> with British decadence...<br> ...or our faith in the<br> future of Germany.<br> Colonel von Richter, if I have a<br> disgust for anything it is poverty.<br> And if I've faith in<br> the future of anything...<br> ...it is in the future of money.<br> I cannot understand why<br> you sell us information...<br> ...which will help us to win<br> the war, and you insist...<br> ...upon being paid in money with a<br> very dubious future, British pounds.<br> What makes you think I think<br> Germany will win the war?<br> Apart from other considerations...<br> ...apparently you attach little<br> importance to these documents.<br> Firstly, I cannot sell you the...<br> ...ability to make proper use<br> of the information I got for you.<br> Secondly, by informing a man<br> about to be hanged of the...<br> ...exact size, location<br> and strength of the rope...<br> ...you do not remove the hangman or<br> the certainty of his being hanged.<br> And now I am sure you'll<br> want to rejoin your friends.<br> One week from tonight at the same<br> hour I shall have more film for you.<br> Goodnight.<br> - Goodnight.<br> I trust your meeting was a<br> satisfactory one, Monsieur Hodler?<br> Quite satisfactory, thank you, Madame.<br> And that you will honour<br> us again soon?<br> The honour will be mine.<br> - Goodnight.<br> How charmingly you Swiss<br> click your heels.<br> And old Swiss custom?<br> Goodnight.<br> You may retire. Turn out the lights.<br> - Thank you, Madame.<br> A profitable evening?<br> Profitable enough to bring<br> the total of 75.000 pounds.<br> Another six or seven weeks<br> should do it.<br> Diello, why don't you stop now?<br> Why go on playing with fire?<br> - What makes you think I am?<br> Don't treat me like an idiot child.<br> Your friend Hodler, he isn't Swiss.<br> I know a Prussian when I see one.<br> - Does it matter to you?<br> Your safety matters to me.<br> So many people are concerned<br> about my safety.<br> I never felt more secure.<br> Well, I don't. And my security<br> depends upon yours.<br> Forgive me. I keep thinking<br> of myself as a man.<br> I keep forgetting I'm a<br> valet who pays dividends.<br> Must you live so soon?<br> I mustn't stay away from<br> the Embassy for long.<br> I can't see why<br> a man as rich as you...<br> ...should go on pressing the trousers<br> of the British Ambassador.<br> That's were I get my money.<br> I steal the change from his pockets.<br> Before you go, Diello, get<br> me a drink, will you?<br> Tell me...<br> ...where do you plan to settle when<br> you leave for South America?<br> Rio.<br> - I've never been there.<br> There's nothing like it in the world.<br> When did you decide to go there?<br> - To go back.<br> I decided that the moment I first<br> saw it, many years ago.<br> I was a cabin boy on a<br> dirty tramp steamer.<br> I can remember standing at the rail...<br> ...looking up at a villa high on the<br> mountainside above the harbour.<br> I could see a man on a balcony<br> looking down at my ship.<br> He was wearing a white dinner jacket.<br> He seemed close enough to touch...<br> ...and yet he was beyond<br> the reach of anyone.<br> I swore then that some<br> day I'd be that man.<br> You might find Rio de<br> Janeiro not to your liking.<br> Do you have a nationality, Diello?<br> - Most people are born somewhere.<br> You're not a native Englishman.<br> What are you?<br> Albanian. English by adoption.<br> You're the only Albanian<br> I've ever known.<br> If you know one, you know them all.<br> I ran away to sea when I was a boy.<br> - And then?<br> Once in England, it seemed<br> profitable to become a gentleman.<br> So I went into service.<br> As you have pointed out,<br> I am not yet a gentleman.<br> I am the best of the gentlemen's<br> gentlemen, which reminds me...<br> ...the Ambassador will be waiting.<br> What will you tell him?<br> - That I was detained...<br> ...by a Turkish chamber-maid.<br> - He might not approve.<br> Why shouldn't he? Only a woman of<br> my own class would detain me...<br> ...and only a man of my<br> class would permit her to.<br> Diello.<br> - Yes, Anna?<br> During the next five weeks<br> Cicero sold the Germans...<br> ...35 top secret documents...<br> ...which brought his growing fortune<br> to 155,000 pounds sterling.<br> The Germans knew<br> every secret word the...<br> ...British Ambassador<br> set to paper...<br> ...every secret conference,<br> every secret pact.<br> And yet despite the unerring<br> accuracy of the information...<br> ...gathered from the documents...<br> ...German Intelligence<br> refused to act upon it...<br> ...out of fear that Cicero<br> might be a British plant.<br> As for the British...<br> ...they had failed to uncover<br> any breach in their security.<br> Travers grew more sure<br> that his first assumption...<br> ...was correct...<br> ...that there was no<br> spy to lay hands on.<br> And so in your three years<br> as her husband's valet...<br> ...you learned more about<br> them that we could in a...<br> ...life-time of investigation.<br> - Infinitely more, sir.<br> I respect your reluctance to<br> discuss their private affairs.<br> It's also reassuring<br> to me, personally.<br> But, Diello, we are at war.<br> - I understand sir.<br> Did you ever have occasion to<br> hear the Countess express...<br> ...sympathy for the Nazis,<br> privately or openly?<br> The Countess never spoke of...<br> ...countries, political<br> parties or groups.<br> The world, to her, was made up of<br> individuals she liked o disliked.<br> Would you consider her to<br> have been pro-German?<br> She was capable of<br> being pro-anything...<br> ...if it made for a<br> congenial dinner party.<br> Would you consider it possible,<br> under certain circumstances...<br> ...for her to have become<br> a German agent?<br> Only for money, sir.<br> Of which she has suddenly<br> acquired a plentiful supply.<br> I know nothing about spies<br> and the way they function...<br> ...but I can remember that the<br> Countess had a remarkable talent...<br> ...for receiving confidences<br> from important people.<br> The Count relied upon her for<br> a great deal of information...<br> ...that was otherwise<br> unavailable to him.<br> Thank you, Diello. That's all.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I'll be at the American Embassy.<br> You may take the evening off.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Clever chap.<br> Because he supports your theory?<br> That the breach in our security was<br> no more than a few irresponsible...<br> ...remarks at one of Anna<br> Staviska's dinner parties?<br> Frankly, that is a fairly<br> accurate summary of the...<br> ...report I will send to London.<br> I hope you're right.<br> The fact remains, however...<br> ...that von Papen still anticipates<br> every move I make.<br> You may soon be doing<br> some anticipating, sir...<br> ...about von Papen and his moves.<br> How do you mean that?<br> Now, this is extremely<br> confidential, but...<br> ...our cryptographers have succeeded<br> in breaking a German diplomatic code.<br> The code use by their Embassy here?<br> That's welcome news, I must say.<br> They'll discard the code...<br> ...just as we change<br> ours periodically.<br> We'll be eaves-dropping<br> on the German Ambassador.<br> To eavesdrop on von Papen...<br> ...a pleasure I have long hoped for.<br> Nervous, Colonel?<br> This house is too<br> dangerous meeting place.<br> The British may be watching it.<br> They haven't yet, but they will soon.<br> They suspect the Countess<br> is a German agent.<br> Are you serious?<br> And all the while you suspected<br> she was a British agent.<br> Amusing, isn't it?<br> - Not at all.<br> We shouldn't have met here.<br> From now on, we won't.<br> Do you know the Aslan Hane<br> Mosque in the Old Quarter?<br> Moyzisch will find it.<br> We'll meet in the entrance a<br> week from tonight at the same hour.<br> Be sure to take your shoes off. The<br> Moslems will resent if you don't.<br> Childish.<br> - No more childish than...<br> ...your resenting someone's<br> hat being on in church.<br> What am I buying this week?<br> An exchange of notes between<br> the Turks and the British.<br> The Turks have decided to remain<br> neutral for the time being.<br> But such information is hardly<br> worth 20,000 pounds.<br> Is good news of no value<br> to you Germans?<br> Or are you willing to pay<br> only for storm warnings...<br> ...of disasters you can<br> do nothing about?<br> There's a disaster we<br> can do something about...<br> ...and which it is most important<br> for us to have information...<br> ...as quickly as possible.<br> - Sounds exciting.<br> A certain code word has appeared to<br> several documents you've sold us.<br> The word is Overlord.<br> Do you know what it means?<br> Not the foggiest notion.<br> - We're convinced...<br> ...that overlord is the code name<br> for their second front...<br> ...the invasion of Western Europe.<br> We must know the place...<br> ...and the date,<br> the where and the when.<br> The where and when of the<br> Allies' invasion of Europe.<br> It'd be nice to know.<br> I can understand your curiosity.<br> I'll pay you double for it.<br> Generous. But is information<br> of that nature likely to turn up...<br> ...at the British Embassy?<br> Don't you read the documents you sell?<br> Not all of them, and never thoroughly.<br> I'm not interested in what they say.<br> I just photograph everything<br> that's stamped secret...<br> ...most secret and top secret.<br> Last week you photographed<br> a dispatch from...<br> ...London to the Ambassador.<br> It stated that he would receive<br> a copy of the revised...<br> ...strategic plan for Overlord<br> within ten days.<br> Did you say, 40,000 pounds?<br> For the where and the when.<br> We'll met at the Aslan Hane<br> Mosque one week from tonight.<br> Do you mind going out<br> through the garden?<br> Not at all.<br> You and the Countess must be<br> running out of small talk, anyway.<br> Goodnight.<br> This was deciphered from<br> the German code?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Who's seen it?<br> You and I, sir.<br> But McFadden should<br> hear it. I'll need his help.<br> 'From German Embassy, Ankara.<br> To Reich Foreign Minister, Berlin.<br> In replay your query concerning<br> authenticity documents...<br> ...obtain from Cicero, am firmly<br> convinced material genuine.<br> Cicero lives within British Embassy...<br> ...obviously has access to<br> top secret information.<br> Kaltenbrunner's failure<br> evaluate documents...<br> ...make them available<br> to me tragic blunder.<br> Strongly urge you bring this matter<br> to personal attention of the Fuhrer.<br> Signed, von Papen.'<br> Cicero? Cicero?<br> It's a code name for their informer.<br> Where do we start?<br> With your permission, I'll<br> order a house search at once.<br> Cicero probably left anything<br> incriminating lying about.<br> Something might turn up.<br> - One thing's sure.<br> An open search'll put him<br> on his guard.<br> That can't be helped.<br> If we can't catch him,<br> we've got to frighten him.<br> Frighten him enough to make<br> him stop for a while.<br> At any rate, we'll gain time.<br> Gentlemen, I'm forced to leave<br> this matter in your hands.<br> I am expected in Cairo<br> tomorrow evening.<br> You may take all the security<br> measures you consider necessary.<br> I suggest the combination<br> of safes be changed...<br> ...and safety devices installed.<br> - Of course.<br> Do you have enough men?<br> We have four agents in Ankara.<br> I can reassign them to this.<br> - Whatever you think.<br> Tell me, Travers, do you have<br> any idea who it might be?<br> A dozen members of the staff have<br> access to classified material.<br> Clerks, attachs, undersecretaries,<br> the first counsellor and so on.<br> McFadden, you and I.<br> In short Cicero could be<br> any one of us.<br> Yes. Any one of us.<br> It'll be a few days before I get<br> the combination changed...<br> ...but the alarm's on and ready.<br> Just so that I don't set it off,<br> you'd better explain how it work.<br> There's nothing to work.<br> If you turn that dial a sixteenth<br> of an inch in either direction...<br> ...the alarm would go off.<br> You cut off the alarm.<br> I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.<br> Shall I pack your uniforms?<br> I won't need them.<br> - Well, sir. I'll close your bags.<br> Don't be upset if Mr. McFadden...<br> ...should ransack my<br> quarters while I'm gone.<br> There'll no need for<br> that, I'm sure, sir.<br> The stone is wet. Cold and wet.<br> Acceptable to Mohammedans<br> feet, perhaps, but not to mine.<br> It's 22 minutes late.<br> It's the first time. He's<br> never been late before.<br> You say he hasn't been<br> to the villa all this week?<br> Siebert has kept a day and night<br> watch. Cicero has not appeared once.<br> And the Countess?<br> - She has not entertained.<br> She has gone out<br> a few evenings, alone.<br> Cigarette.<br> Can it be possible, sir, that the<br> British have found him out?<br> It can also be possible that they<br> have known about him all the time.<br> Curious. How easily Cicero acquired<br> the documents he wanted to sell.<br> When only once we named the<br> documents we wanted to buy...<br> ...how mysteriously he has<br> failed to deliver it. Light.<br> What does the Colonel<br> propose to do now?<br> Precisely nothing. All spies in<br> time, outlive their usefulness.<br> And I'm afraid, Moyzisch,<br> that your friend Cicero...<br> ...has just about outlive his...<br> ...if any.<br> Voila.<br> Well done, Seora Antonini.<br> It was nothing, Seor. One of my<br> many pleasant wifely duties.<br> How much they cost?<br> - 5,000 pounds.<br> Another 1,000 for the<br> papers to go with them...<br> ...birth and marriage certificates...<br> ...and another 1,000 to help<br> him forget all about us.<br> Money well spent.<br> What about the tickets?<br> Two first-class compartments, separate<br> cars, on the Istanbul Express.<br> Leaving tomorrow evening.<br> - And the ship?<br> An Argentina passenger-freighter,<br> sailing from Istanbul direct to Rio.<br> When?<br> - Day after tomorrow, at sundown.<br> Now, remember, you're to take<br> no notice of me on the train.<br> At Istanbul, we'll go<br> board the ship at once.<br> How did it go at the bank?<br> The size of the deposit<br> created quite a stir.<br> The manager of the bank<br> seemed extremely curious...<br> ...but I managed to satisfy<br> his curiosity on all points...<br> ...when he took me to lunch.<br> - And?<br> He will personally expedite<br> the transfer of funds.<br> The papers will be ready<br> tomorrow morning.<br> How much did that cost?<br> - Another 1,000.<br> And all of my powers of persuasion<br> this side of respectability.<br> A little over generous, perhaps.<br> Now, let see. 9,000 for expenses.<br> That leaves roughly 130,000 pounds.<br> In dollars, about 600,000.<br> In Brazilian cruzeiros,<br> Plus the 40,000<br> you're getting tomorrow.<br> I've pulled out of that transaction.<br> The market's getting shaky.<br> I've decided to retire.<br> Your have here an Argentine<br> gentleman of leisure...<br> ...about to take up<br> residence in Brazil.<br> I'm glad. We have more<br> than enough, anyway.<br> We? We have more than enough?<br> My dear seora Antonini...<br> ...where I come from a<br> man's money is his own.<br> And if his wife is a good wife,<br> he gives her some from time to time.<br> Or course, Roberto. Whatever you say.<br> Will you miss being a Countess?<br> Not for a moment.<br> Not for one moment.<br> Diello!<br> Here's the official correspondence.<br> And the Ambassador's mail.<br> Will you keep it for him? I'm leaving.<br> Will his Excellency return<br> tomorrow as planned?<br> Not till Sunday. There's<br> a list of his calls.<br> What a pity that so few ladies use<br> perfumed letter paper these days.<br> A great pity. Perhaps you'd better<br> look up that mail too, Diello.<br> As you wish, sir.<br> Diello.<br> Weren't you away from the Embassy<br> between 9 and 10 last night?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Would you mind telling me where?<br> Not at all, sir. I walked for a<br> while on the boulevard...<br> ...stopped for a drink<br> at the Yuskel...<br> ...then back to the Embassy.<br> One other question about<br> the Countess again.<br> Do you remember any close friends<br> she may have in Switzerland?<br> Did she go there often?<br> - Very often.<br> The Countess was fond of<br> Switzerland. She went every spring.<br> Then that explains it.<br> The Countess left by plane<br> for Switzerland this morning.<br> I hope she can enjoy it in the<br> style she is accustomed.<br> That shouldn't be a problem.<br> She took 130,000 pounds with her.<br> You ready, Mac?<br> I'm calling for His Excellency,<br> the British Ambassador.<br> I have a message for the<br> Countess Staviska.<br> Madame, left for Switzerland<br> this morning, sir.<br> I don't know, sir.<br> Madame said it was<br> for an indefinite stay.<br> Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> No. I can give you no<br> information, Your Excellency...<br> ...beyond the Countess Staviska<br> has withdrawn all of her funds.<br> Yes. You are very welcome.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> I can reach Colonel von<br> Richter immediately.<br> Tell him I can get the<br> merchandise he wanted.<br> I cannot deliver it here in Ankara.<br> No, it's impossible.<br> I'm being watched too closely.<br> I shall have to ring off now.<br> Tell him I'll arrange a<br> meeting place in Istanbul.<br> I'm leaving this evening.<br> I'll call you at the Consulate<br> in Istanbul tomorrow.<br> He didn't speak to anyone.<br> He made some phone calls<br> and came back here.<br> You're on the wrong track,<br> sniffing after Diello.<br> He didn't bat an eye when you<br> told him about the Countess.<br> Well, there's something about him,<br> there's something about him.<br> Why, for one thing, should he go<br> to a cafe to make a few phone calls?<br> What do you want?<br> - Is all right if I clean office now?<br> No. His Excellency won't<br> be back until tomorrow.<br> I've to wash windows<br> while it is still daylight.<br> Not now, I said. Come back later.<br> Did you see him?<br> - Who?<br> Turn off the alarm.<br> Open it up. Diello!<br> Where's Diello?<br> He ran out, he was chasing someone.<br> Follow him, Johnson.<br> Find him.<br> - Shall I try to hold him?<br> Just find him and report back.<br> Send a cable to London.<br> I want all available information<br> on Diello here at once.<br> Give me that dispatch case.<br> Nothing seems to be missing here.<br> How many letters have you there?<br> Four. We locked up five.<br> That letter.<br> The perfumed letter gone, but<br> nothing out of the dispatch case.<br> It's odd.<br> McFadden.<br> Photographs.<br> Have Barrows watch the<br> approaches to German Embassy.<br> We must get that film.<br> It'll be sticky, grabbing him to<br> public. The Turkish might not like it.<br> We can't kidnap him,<br> we'll have to kill him.<br> We've got to consider<br> Operation Overlord.<br> Send a man out to the airport.<br> We'll get out to the railroad station.<br> Siebert, you and Steuben take<br> the train to Istanbul this evening.<br> We will take the plane. He's bound<br> to be aboard one or the other.<br> Shall we go armed, Colonel?<br> - Naturally.<br> You are to protect Cicero from<br> the British at all costs...<br> ...until we get that film.<br> And after that?<br> After that, Moyzisch, it will be<br> up to Cicero to protect himself...<br> ...from the British and<br> from us. That's all.<br> This is the car. I couldn't see<br> which compartment exactly.<br> We'll try them all.<br> This compartment is occupied.<br> - Excuse me.<br> C'est occupe.<br> - Pardon me.<br> I will not fail you, sir.<br> This compartment<br> is occupied, gentleman.<br> May I see your reservation?<br> - We didn't have time to get one.<br> We'd like to purchase<br> a compartment in this car.<br> I am sorry. There are none available.<br> We'd be happy to make<br> it worth your while.<br> There are none available, gentleman.<br> I shall have to ask you to<br> move to the next car.<br> You might as well put that away<br> and fill your pipe instead.<br> There's nothing to do but see<br> to it that none of them get off.<br> Do you suppose the Nazis<br> have get the film?<br> No.<br> They wouldn't be playing<br> watch-dog for him.<br> They're going to take care<br> of him until they get it...<br> ...and that'll be in Istanbul.<br> And so by the time your receive<br> this, my dear Ambassador...<br> ...I shall be away from Ankara...<br> ...far away from intrigue and<br> uncertainty and humiliation.<br> I shall be settled, I hope, in a<br> new life of peace and security...<br> ...and self-respect.<br> You have spoken so often to<br> me, my dear friend, of Diello...<br> ...the perfect valet who<br> served my late husband...<br> ...and who serves you now.<br> Surely I can offer no greater<br> proof of my affection for you...<br> ...and my devotion<br> to the Allied cause...<br> ...than to inform you now<br> that your trusted Diello...<br> ...is a German spy.<br> I know that both you and<br> your government...<br> Just a few minutes, sir.<br> Good morning, gentlemen.<br> Did you sleep well?<br> I slept extremely well...<br> ...guards to the left of me,<br> guards to the right of me.<br> Are you my bodyguards?<br> Or are you my assassins?<br> We are to protect<br> you from the British.<br> Honoured. It puts me in right in a<br> class with Norway, Denmark and...<br> ...Holland, and other things<br> you protect from the British.<br> If anyone were to lay a hand of me...<br> ...I could expose and ruin<br> this film in few seconds.<br> You are in no danger.<br> We will go with...<br> ...you to the German Consulate.<br> Don't be whimsical. I have come<br> to give a message for Moyzisch.<br> Tell him he's to meet me<br> at Hakim's Restaurant...<br> ...at six o'clock, this evening.<br> We prefer you go to the Consulate...<br> ...at the same hour, if you like.<br> - No, although, I am tempted.<br> So many more people go into<br> German Consulate than come out.<br> I've wondered what attraction<br> could keep them there so long.<br> We must have some guarantee<br> that you have the film.<br> I thought you were the silent partner.<br> Here is all the guarantee you'll need.<br> Don't unwrap it.<br> It's a strip of film.<br> It shows a piece...<br> ...of the document that<br> von Richter wants to buy.<br> I'll deliver the rest when Moyzisch...<br> ...pays me 100,000 pounds.<br> - 100,000!<br> I forgot to tell you.<br> I raised the price.<br> Ready, Moyzisch?<br> - Yes.<br> Remember to be extremely friendly.<br> Give him the money first.<br> When you get the film...<br> ...come straight back here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You know what to do after that.<br> There's the problem<br> of the Turkish police.<br> It isn't likely you will choose to<br> kill Cicero on a crowded street...<br> ...or in front of a policeman.<br> It's hardly likely he will<br> go to the police himself.<br> Not with 100,000 British<br> pounds in his pocket.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - And good luck.<br> No luck?<br> This city was created by Allah,<br> for the convenience of spies.<br> Nobody ever found anybody in Istanbul.<br> Anything going here?<br> - Von Richter and Moyzisch went in.<br> Likewise our two playmates.<br> Nobody's come out.<br> Yet.<br> Moyzisch, my dear colleague,<br> I'm delighted to see you.<br> It's far too early for civilized<br> dining but I have a busy evening.<br> Will you have something to eat?<br> - I'm not hungry.<br> Do you feel faint, perhaps?<br> Then sit down and have some<br> Turkish Banana brandy.<br> It stimulates the blood and makes<br> heroes of all who drink it.<br> I must accustom myself to pouring<br> drinks from a sitting position.<br> It isn't easy to break<br> the habits of a lifetime.<br> Let's get on with the business.<br> Did you bring all of it?<br> If I were gentlemen, I would assume<br> that the money is all here.<br> I shall not be a gentleman until<br> I have finished counting it.<br> Do you speak English?<br> - A little.<br> I'm looking for a friend. He<br> may be in a private room.<br> Do you have private rooms?<br> Is occupied.<br> He must be in there. I'll just...<br> I'm sorry. He not wish to be disturb.<br> - But he is expecting me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You will sit here, please.<br> There is a time for using your wits,<br> and a time for blasting away.<br> We have no monopoly on blasting away.<br> Those two would drop us before<br> we got clear of this table.<br> He may be handing over the films.<br> We don't want the films,<br> they're worthless.<br> Plans can be changed, you know.<br> We want Cicero, and we<br> want him alive...<br> ...so he can tell us just how<br> much the Nazis have found out.<br> Come to think of it for<br> exactly the same reasons...<br> ...the Nazis must want<br> him very much dead.<br> You're balmy. You're completely balmy.<br> He'll jump at it.<br> My friend may not know we're waiting.<br> Would you give this to him, please?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Abdi Bey, how can I ever thank you<br> enough for your hospitality...<br> ...courtesy and kitchen.<br> It is always a joy to see you, Diello.<br> It takes me back to old times.<br> Thank you. No answer required.<br> Who was that note from?<br> What was in it?<br> Would you like to purchase<br> a photograph of it?<br> Why so nervous? This is<br> the greatest day of your life.<br> When you die, Hitler will dip you in<br> bronze and name streets after you.<br> Can't you count a little faster?<br> - Haste makes waste.<br> You've grown fond of me, is that it?<br> You're upset because you know<br> I haven't much longer to live.<br> Those two men are here to protect you.<br> I didn't say anything about two men.<br> Really, Moyzisch. You and your<br> guilty conscience, and big mouth.<br> There's the film.<br> Has it occurred to you that<br> our roles are now reversed?<br> That the British may try to kill you?<br> How does it feel being me?<br> Keep a stiff upper lip.<br> That's one thing...<br> ...I've learned from the British,<br> the outward composure.<br> Mr. Travers, I am touched<br> by your solicitude.<br> I'm happy to accept your protection.<br> Imagine me, of all men, with a<br> British sword and a British shield.<br> I'd rather slit your throat.<br> Impractical. Then, I'd be unable to<br> tell you the things you want to know.<br> Imagine how confused the Nazis<br> will be to see you protecting me.<br> They half-suspect I've<br> been a British plant all along.<br> We'll see you safely to a taxi,<br> then to the British Consulate.<br> That would be back where I<br> started from. No, thank you.<br> We'll walk a way together,<br> then say goodbye.<br> Listen Diello. We'll protect<br> you from the Gestapo, but...<br> ...we intend to take you alive.<br> I've no intention<br> of being taken alive.<br> We'll get the Turkish<br> police to arrest you.<br> It's against the law, here,<br> to carry a weapon.<br> Did you know that?<br> However, first things first.<br> Shall we startle the Nazis with<br> your concern for my safety?<br> You seem to disapprove me.<br> You're the most cold-blooded<br> thief, traitor and criminal...<br> ...I've seen in a lifetime of<br> looking at human trash.<br> What a pity. I rather hoped<br> I'd look like a gentlemen.<br> Cicero and the British?<br> Put that away. Too many people.<br> They're saying something<br> about our shoes.<br> What's the matter with them?<br> - I don't know.<br> Go on.<br> You must believe me, Colonel,<br> the British held us off.<br> They were protecting him.<br> - Nonsense.<br> But they let him away. In the<br> restaurant, they passed Cicero a note.<br> It has no logic,<br> it does not make sense.<br> An urgent dispatch for you, sir, from<br> his Excellency the Ambassador.<br> Moyzisch! What's the delay?<br> I spoiled the first print.<br> - What?<br> I was so nervous, but the<br> second one is almost ready.<br> Hurry up.<br> Here it is, sir.<br> They fit together perfectly.<br> 'D-Day for Operation Overlord is<br> tentatively set for early June...<br> ...along the coast of Normandy<br> and Cherbourg Peninsula.'<br> Colonel, did you hear it?<br> - Yes, I heard.<br> Now you hear this. An urgent<br> dispatch from von Papen.<br> 'Have just received personal letter<br> from Countess Anna Staviska...<br> ...naming Cicero as British agent.<br> Am unable to corroborate accusation<br> because Countess has left country.<br> In view of her efforts to<br> ingratiate herself with us...<br> ...I'm compelled to believe<br> her charge is true.'<br> I don't believe it.<br> - I've always do it.<br> From the first! I told you so...<br> ...I know the British and<br> their childish tricks!<br> I don't believe it!<br> The earlier documents,<br> they were genuine.<br> Events proved them genuine.<br> - Of course. They had to be...<br> ...so that we would swallow<br> that big lie. That one!<br> I nearly paid with my life for this!<br> I knew it.<br> I knew it all along.<br> Dinner is served, Senhor.<br> Two gentlemen have come<br> to see you, Senhor.<br> Your banker and another gentleman.<br> Senhor da Costa, at this hour?<br> Very well, have them come out.<br> Senhor da Costa, an<br> unexpected pleasure.<br> Senhor Antonini, please<br> forgive this intrusion.<br> May I present my friend,<br> Senhor Santos.<br> I'm honoured.<br> - I've looked forward to meeting you.<br> Please sit down.<br> Will you join me for dinner?<br> Thank you, Senhor, we have dined.<br> - Some wine, perhaps.<br> Senhor Antonini is already known<br> in Rio for his taste in wine.<br> Are you associate with the<br> bank too, Senhor Santos?<br> No, Senhor. With the Brazilian<br> Department of Investigation.<br> Then I assume you investigate<br> Argentine citizens...<br> ...who settle in your beautiful city?<br> - Among other things, yes.<br> And have you discovered some<br> irregularity in my papers?<br> No, Senhor. Your papers<br> are all perfectly in order.<br> There is an irregularity<br> however, Senhor.<br> It is a matter of your<br> account at the bank.<br> Am I overdrawn? As of yesterday<br> I had about 7 million cruzeiros.<br> I was referring to the bank draft with<br> which you purchased this villa.<br> As I recall that transaction,<br> I paid the full sum in cash...<br> ...25,000 pounds sterling.<br> - That is correct.<br> What seems to be difficulty?<br> - The money has been returned.<br> What on earth for?<br> - It is counterfeit.<br> You have a distorted sense<br> of humour, Senhor.<br> The money is counterfeit.<br> As the money which you<br> exchange for Brazilian currency.<br> It is all counterfeit.<br> Believe me, Senhor, I do not<br> wish to leap to conclusions.<br> A gentleman of your<br> obvious refinement...<br> ...perhaps you are<br> an unfortunate dupe.<br> This money has been in<br> circulation for months...<br> ...and the British authorities have<br> only recently detected the forgery.<br> I have samples here of every<br> series in your possession.<br> They are the most skilful<br> facsimiles I have ever seen.<br> Senhor Antonini, I implore<br> you to cooperate.<br> We know that these counterfeit<br> notes were printed in Germany.<br> The British have established that.<br> And so far, they have turned<br> up in three places...<br> ...here in Brazil, in Turkey<br> and in Switzerland.<br> Switzerland?<br> - Over 100,000...<br> ...counterfeit British pounds were<br> confiscated there recently.<br> In the possession of a<br> political refugee, a lady.<br> It will be in your interest to tell us<br> where and how you got this money.<br> Switzerland.<br> Believe me, Senhor, this<br> is no laughing matter.<br> It is my unhappy duty to inform<br> you that you are under arrest.<br> Anna.<br> - I beg you pardon?<br> Anna. Poor Anna.<br>
