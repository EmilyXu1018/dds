                        It's like this. A dead plaintiff<br> is rarely worth as much<br> as a living,<br> severely maimed plaintiff.<br> However, if it's a long,<br> agonizing death,<br> as opposed to a quick drowning<br> or car wreck,<br> the value can rise considerably.<br> A dead adult in his 20s is worth less<br> than a middle-aged one,<br> a dead woman less than a dead man,<br> single adults less than married,<br> black less than white,<br> poor less than rich.<br> But the perfect victim<br> is a white, male, professional -<br> of his earning power,<br> struck down in his prime.<br> And the most imperfect?<br> Well, in the calculus<br> of personal injury law,<br> a dead child is worth least of all.<br> A million dollars he turns down.<br> - One million dollars!<br> - I don't believe their story.<br> - It's true.<br> - Come on!<br> - Hey, Eddie. How you doing?<br> - Good.<br> Do me a favor - shut the fuck up.<br> Our banker there doesn't know<br> Jan refused a million.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Yeah.<br> Asshole.<br> How's your head? Up?<br> How's that? OK?<br> Are you comfortable?<br> Open?<br> Here we go.<br> All rise.<br> This court is now in session.<br> The Honorable<br> Constance Mullen presiding.<br> Would you like some water?<br> Carney versus Massachusetts<br> General Hospital -<br> case number 812725.<br> Attorneys,<br> please state your appearance.<br> Randolph Woodside, Mass General.<br> Greg Monk,<br> Massachusetts General Hospital.<br> Harold Peshniak, Mass General.<br> Jan Schlichtmann for Paul Carney.<br> Kevin Conway for Mr Carney,<br> Your Honor.<br> Mr Schlichtmann, we're ready<br> for your opening statement.<br> Your Honor,<br> if it please the court,<br> the parties involved<br> have agreed to a settlement.<br> Personal injury law<br> has a bad reputation.<br> They call us ambulance chasers,<br> bottom feeders,<br> vultures preying on<br> the misfortunes of others.<br> If that's true, why do I lie awake<br> worrying about my clients?<br> Why is their pain my pain?<br> I wish I didn't empathize.<br> It'd be a lot easier.<br> We're speaking to Jan Schlichtmann,<br> personal injury attorney<br> and according to Boston magazine -<br> have you seen this? -<br> one of Boston's<br> ten most eligible bachelors.<br> Let's go back to the phones. Woburn,<br> you're on the air.<br> Mr Schlichtmann,<br> it's Anne Anderson.<br> - Hello.<br> - How are you?<br> Very well. You? Sounds pretty.<br> How come you never call me?<br> - If I had your number, I would.<br> - You have it.<br> - I do?<br> - You have no idea who I am?<br> - Is this Ricky?<br> - No.<br> You see, my son died of leukemia<br> two years ago.<br> - Your firm is handling the case.<br> - We are?<br> The reason I'm calling you here<br> is because my calls to your offices<br> have gone unreturned for weeks.<br> - Sorry, your name was?<br> - Anne.<br> - Anne...<br> - Anderson.<br> I'm writing that down.<br> I'm gonna take care of this.<br> Why don't you come up to Woburn<br> and actually meet a few of those<br> people whose pain is your pain?<br> Let me picture this.<br> She called you, she cried.<br> You felt sorry and you cried.<br> - Now she's mad.<br> - It's a good case.<br> - She's not crying now!<br> - An orphan, but good.<br> leukemia - eight of them children.<br> - That's unusual?<br> - Statistically. It's a small town.<br> She lost a child?<br> They think it's something to do<br> with the city's drinking water<br> which they say tastes funny.<br> What was she like before?<br> - Do want to hear what it's about?<br> - No, I don't!<br> I'd like to hear about it.<br> Thank you, Kathy.<br> There's a report here<br> from state inspectors<br> saying that the water<br> from two city wells<br> is contaminated - or was<br> before they shut them down -<br> with something called...<br> I can't pronounce this...<br> trichloroethylene... ethylene,<br> which the EPA lists<br> as a probable carcinogen.<br> - Stop.<br> - There's more.<br> No, from a financial standpoint,<br> this is not a sound investment.<br> Probable is a euphemism<br> for unproven.<br> To prove something like this,<br> you need new medical research.<br> Is that our business -<br> medical research?<br> And... and ask yourself,<br> why is this an orphan?<br> It's been kicked around<br> before ending up on your desk.<br> Gordon's right.<br> I can appreciate<br> the theatrical value of dead kids.<br> That's good. But that's all it has<br> going for it, and it's not enough.<br> I'll get rid of it.<br> I'll... just go up there and...<br> You'll both start to cry again,<br> she'll be mad at me.<br> I'll do it. I'll get rid of it.<br> Give it to me.<br> Thank you.<br> - There you go, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Drive careful.<br> - Yeah.<br> When I stand on my porch,<br> I can see the houses<br> where children died.<br> These are the Kanes,<br> the Toomeys, the Zohners,<br> the Robbins and the Aufieros.<br> Now, I want to be clear.<br> I'm not interested in money -<br> none of us are.<br> What we want is to know what<br> happened. And we want an apology.<br> - From who?<br> - Whoever did this.<br> I want somebody to come and say,<br> "We're responsible.<br> "We didn't mean it,<br> but we're sorry."<br> But who is that?<br> Well, we don't know.<br> Mrs Anderson, our firm is<br> very small, just three attorneys.<br> We can only take<br> so many cases at once<br> and we have to be choosy because,<br> frankly, we can't afford to lose.<br> We pay everything. We only get paid<br> if we win or settle.<br> - I know.<br> - You want an apology.<br> And I'd love to get you<br> that apology, but from who?<br> Who is going to apologize to you and<br> pay me?<br> There has to be a defendant<br> with very deep pockets.<br> This is not<br> an inexpensive case to try.<br> There's an old tannery out there.<br> A tannery?<br> And some other small factories.<br> I really wish I could help you<br> but I can't. I'm sorry.<br> Maybe you could go out to<br> the river, to the wells, and look.<br> For what?<br> What would that accomplish?<br> I do hope you find someone.<br> And I am sorry.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Drive carefully.<br> It was fate.<br> I was meant to get that ticket,<br> at that moment, at that exact spot.<br> Do you know who Beatrice is?<br> Peter Pan peanut butter,<br> Tropicana orange juice,<br> Rosarita Mexican Food,<br> Swiss Miss cocoa, Samsonite<br> luggage... The list goes on!<br> - And the other one?<br> - W.R. Grace.<br> Chemical plants in two dozen states,<br> South America, Europe and Japan.<br> - What's this?<br> - The ticket.<br> No, I've got that right here.<br> - I got two speeding tickets.<br> - A two-ticket town?<br> Exactly.<br> Don't take your Caddie there.<br> Kevin, it's a gold mine.<br> You almost let it get away.<br> I almost let it get away.<br> Lawsuits are war -<br> it's as simple as that.<br> And they begin the same way,<br> with a declaration of war -<br> the complaint.<br> When you're a small firm<br> and they're big,<br> steeped in history and wealth,<br> with Persian carpets on the floor<br> and Harvard diplomas on the walls,<br> it's easy to be intimidated.<br> Don't - that's what they want.<br> That's what they expect,<br> like all bullies.<br> That's how they win.<br> I don't run away from bullies.<br> Mr Facher...<br> Mr Doyle asked<br> me to bring this to you.<br> When?<br> - When did he ask me?<br> - Yeah.<br> Just now.<br> On your lunch break?<br> That hardly seems fair.<br> I almost never go to lunch, sir.<br> Too much to do.<br> I just grab something.<br> You know, I'd make a point<br> of taking an hour or so<br> away from all the noise<br> and insanity.<br> I should do that.<br> I'd find a place that was<br> relatively quiet and peaceful,<br> have a sandwich, read a magazine.<br> Maybe listen to a game<br> if one was on.<br> I'd make sure everyone knew not<br> to disturb me during that hour.<br> Because that would be my time -<br> my own private time,<br> which no-one, if they had any sense<br> of self-preservation,<br> would dare interrupt.<br> If I were you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Jesus.<br> Jesus!<br> Jesus...<br> Mr Facher, it's Bill Cheeseman -<br> Foley, Hoag and Elliot.<br> We represent New York Grace.<br> How you doing?<br> Well, all right, I guess,<br> under the circumstances.<br> What circumstances are those?<br> Woburn - these outrageous charges.<br> This bloodsucking<br> ambulance chaser, Schlichtmann.<br> Who?<br> We're co-defendants in a lawsuit,<br> Mr Facher, a very serious lawsuit.<br> - What?<br> - What is that thumping?<br> Yeah, well, it's gone now.<br> It was driving me crazy!<br> I was wondering<br> if I could talk to you.<br> - Could we meet for a drink or...<br> - What's on your mind?<br> I'll tell you what I'm thinking.<br> - Are you familiar with Rule 11?<br> - With what?<br> Rule 11, a civil provision<br> to prevent frivolous and<br> irresponsible lawsuits like this,<br> and sanction quite severely<br> those who file them.<br> Mr... Cheeseman. Cheeseman, is it?<br> Mr Cheeseman. What is a fine?<br> You get fined,<br> you pay it and carry on.<br> If you're gonna knock a guy down,<br> do it so he can't get up again.<br> What are you looking for<br> with this suit?<br> Obviously, we're seeking<br> compensation for the families<br> and punitive damages for willful<br> negligence by these companies.<br> But is that what<br> this is about - money?<br> - No.<br> - Is that what matters most?<br> - No.<br> - It's about this.<br> And this.<br> And this.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I know, we have<br> no feelings, no compassion,<br> no empathy for<br> our clients' suffering.<br> Can I say something?<br> What does that<br> have to do with anything?<br> The lawyer who shares<br> his client's pain<br> does his client<br> such a grave disservice<br> he should have his license<br> to practice taken away.<br> It clouds his judgement,<br> and that's as useful<br> as a doctor<br> who's frightened of blood.<br> All rise.<br> This court is now in session.<br> The Honorable<br> Walter J Skinner presiding.<br> Is this the only case?<br> This is a lot of lawyers.<br> Sit down.<br> You're looking well.<br> The Red Sox must be in first place.<br> Roger Clemens<br> is the answer to my prayers.<br> You have some interest in this case?<br> I'm a co-defendant, but it's not<br> my motion. It's Foley-Hoag's.<br> - And that motion?<br> - Your Honor.<br> - I'm Jan Schlichtmann.<br> - I know. Sit down.<br> The matter before us seems simple.<br> - Your Honor, it isn't.<br> - May I hear it?<br> The intention here is to place me<br> under a cloud of impropriety.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes. What they're saying<br> is that they know law and I don't,<br> they're real lawyers and I'm not.<br> They're just trying to humiliate me.<br> You are a personal injury lawyer,<br> aren't you? I think you'll survive.<br> - See? It's starting already.<br> - No, you've started already.<br> I'm on the defensive,<br> they're the defendants.<br> Do you think<br> I might hear this motion<br> before You explain to ME<br> what it's really about?<br> - Of course.<br> - Thank you.<br> Now, Mr... Cheeseman, is it?<br> Your motion to dismiss<br> is based on?<br> Rule 11, Your Honor.<br> Specifically that Mr Schlichtmann had<br> no evidential grounds<br> on which to bring this suit -<br> only his knowledge that W.R. Grace<br> Corporation has a lot of money.<br> Not true.<br> He performed no real investigation,<br> did no research of any consequence,<br> except perhaps<br> to review profit statements.<br> And he's prepared his complaint<br> so inexpertly as to render it moot.<br> - All untrue.<br> - Do you know what Rule 11 is?<br> To be honest, Your Honor,<br> I had to look it up.<br> I'll be honest, so did l.<br> Do you know why, Mr Cheeseman?<br> Because it is so old and ambiguous<br> few lawyers<br> waste their time with it, or mine.<br> It's a non-issue, Mr Cheeseman.<br> Your motion is denied. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> - Anything else?<br> - No, Your Honor.<br> Set a trial date.<br> Excuse me, Mr Facher.<br> I'd like to thank you.<br> That was very statesman-like of you<br> not to join that ridiculous attack.<br> You're welcome.<br> We have to show how<br> the toxic solvents these factories<br> dumped on the land there,<br> were drawn into the city wells here<br> and Well H over there,<br> and then pumped<br> into east Woburn homes.<br> So I'll need to inspect<br> and map the debris,<br> drill some monitoring wells,<br> conduct seismic tests, and so on.<br> And you're talking about you<br> and a couple of assistants?<br> No. I mean a team of<br> geologists and engineers.<br> - A team?<br> - A big team.<br> It's actually quite exciting.<br> The nature of the contour<br> here means there's an effect -<br> named after me, actually...<br> In the shop, Mr Roberts,<br> you used solvents to clean brushes?<br> What would you've done with that<br> stuff back in the 1970s and '80s?<br> - Used solvent? Put it in drums.<br> - 35-gallon drums?<br> What would you do with full drums?<br> - Don't know.<br> - They just went?<br> - Never noticed.<br> - Did you dump them?<br> - No.<br> - Nothing like that?<br> - Never noticed anyone who did?<br> - No.<br> Just disappeared...<br> What were your duties<br> at Grace, Mr Shalline?<br> Discharge to the drains. Be sure<br> we weren't polluting the air.<br> Then you know that chemicals<br> were deposited behind the plant?<br> I don't know that.<br> Six barrels of toxic waste<br> were found there in a pit<br> and exhumed by city inspectors.<br> - You didn't know?<br> - Nope.<br> Back in 1965 did you<br> clean metal parts with solvent?<br> Yes.<br> - What kind?<br> - That I couldn't say.<br> Did you ever notice<br> the name trichloroethylene or TCE?<br> I don't know.<br> But you'd put it in barrels<br> when you were finished, right?<br> Yes.<br> Did you ever see<br> what happened to these barrels?<br> Yes.<br> What was that?<br> - They get dumped.<br> - Where?<br> - Out back, in the ground.<br> - You saw this?<br> Yes.<br> - When?<br> - My coffee break.<br> I would go out and hit<br> nine-iron shots with golf balls.<br> Do you want a break?<br> - Do you need a break?<br> - No.<br> Did you see who was dumping<br> the stuff while hitting golf balls?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - The names of people.<br> He wants to tell us.<br> He won't tell us.<br> He has to work there.<br> But he lives near Anne Anderson.<br> He sees her every day.<br> - Mr Love, do you have any children?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Eight of them.<br> - Eight?<br> My goodness! That's quite a family.<br> What do you think<br> of the water in Woburn?<br> Now? It's all right.<br> What about then, 15 years ago?<br> It had an odor then.<br> Chlorine or something.<br> - Did you drink it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - The kids?<br> - Yes.<br> Were you concerned when you found<br> the wells were contaminated?<br> I object to that.<br> You don't have to answer that.<br> - Yeah, I was concerned.<br> - For your family?<br> Yes.<br> Has any member of your family<br> had any unusual illness?<br> You don't have to answer<br> any of these type of questions.<br> - Yeah.<br> - What kind?<br> One of my sons has seizures,<br> my eldest daughter<br> has had two miscarriages<br> and my youngest was born with...<br> Are we going to go through<br> their entire medical history?<br> If you don't want to hear, leave.<br> What's wrong? We're deposing<br> Grace employees, not Beatrice.<br> - I have a right to be here.<br> - Then sit down and shut up!<br> Mr Love,<br> are you aware that some of your<br> neighbors have had leukemia?<br> Yes, I am.<br> They think it's the water.<br> Al, that water<br> hasn't made anybody sick.<br> - How do you know?<br> - I just do.<br> A lot of people in my neighborhood<br> are dead,<br> or dying, Mr Chessman,<br> from something.<br> Look, if I took a hundred pennies<br> and threw them in the air,<br> half would land heads<br> and half tails, right?<br> Looking close, I'd probably find<br> some heads grouped together.<br> Does that mean anything?<br> You see, no one knows<br> what causes leukemia, Al.<br> No one knows<br> what caused that cluster.<br> I know what happened.<br> And I know who did it.<br> Al, this is very important.<br> I want you to tell me<br> who those people are.<br> I'm not a rat.<br> You know, it's important,<br> because if there is something wrong,<br> we need to disclose it<br> to the authorities.<br> We need to get them out there<br> and have it cleaned up.<br> You think about that and call me.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Do you eat peanut butter?<br> No.<br> You've never eaten peanut butter?<br> I guess everyone alive<br> has tried it,<br> but I'm not a peanut butter fan.<br> Did your son<br> ever eat peanut butter?<br> - Do you eat bacon?<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - How often? How many slices?<br> Do you have Teflon pans<br> in your kitchen?<br> Do you chew sugarless gum?<br> Do you pump your own gas?<br> Do you use hair spray?<br> Do you use artificial sweeteners?<br> Smoke cigarettes? Drink diet soda?<br> Use tampons?<br> Are your clothes ever dry-cleaned?<br> Do you have silver fillings<br> in your teeth?<br> You knew when you moved to Woburn<br> that its water didn't taste good?<br> Yeah, but lots of places<br> the water doesn't taste so good.<br> I agree with that.<br> Did you ever consider<br> using bottled water?<br> We used bottled water off and on,<br> split half and half.<br> Like... we cooked with<br> regular water - tap water.<br> We did other things,<br> like make orange juice.<br> But to... drink just straight<br> water, we drank bottled water.<br> Has a doctor ever said that you have<br> any immune system dysfunction?<br> No. But when my son died,<br> they told us that was why he died.<br> His immune system was...<br> tore down to nothing.<br> - Why did you have an autopsy?<br> - Because he was doing good.<br> He only lived three months<br> with leukemia<br> and he looked fine.<br> Did you talk to the doctor<br> about this?<br> I had more like<br> a violent talk with him.<br> - "Violent"? You were angry?<br> - Yelling at him.<br> Your son seemed to be doing<br> all right. He was in remission?<br> You were optimistic about his future<br> and suddenly he became ill and died.<br> And they said that was expected -<br> that anybody with a disease like<br> leukemia could die any minute.<br> - But you were angry and upset.<br> - My son just died.<br> I understand, I'm just<br> trying to recreate the event.<br> You know when your child isn't well.<br> You try to explain on the phone<br> and they say,<br> "Has he got a temperature?"<br> You say, "No."<br> "He's all right, then," they say.<br> "Don't worry - bring him<br> into the clinic Monday."<br> He died Monday morning.<br> He was in the clinic when he died?<br> No.<br> He was in the car on the way.<br> He died in the car<br> on the way to the clinic?<br> He died on l-93,<br> up by the Somerville exit.<br> My wife was yelling<br> that he'd stopped breathing.<br> I pulled over<br> and tried to give him CPR.<br> I was holding him in my lap.<br> Lauren was...<br> screaming.<br> Cars and trucks rushing by.<br> And...<br> she helped...<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's all right.<br> It's OK.<br> These people can never testify.<br> No.<br> We'll have the first seven<br> monitor wells in this area,<br> in the permeable rock here.<br> All right. There's seven?<br> Yes. I did say only seven.<br> Now we'll probably<br> have 12, because...<br> Hey! Hey!<br> - Private property.<br> - Yes, your property.<br> My property and you're trespassing.<br> - Here.<br> - What the fuck is this?<br> That's a court order, Mr Riley,<br> giving me the right to be here,<br> and to inspect every inch<br> of your tannery, too.<br> No, keep that. That's your copy.<br> Let's go.<br> I started working<br> when I was seven years old,<br> sweeping the beam house floors<br> for my father,<br> which he swept for his father<br> when he was seven years old.<br> - Which my boys...<br> - I know. They swept it, too.<br> Please answer the question I asked.<br> Silicone and trichloroethylene.<br> These two chemicals mixed together<br> are used to waterproof leather,<br> are they not?<br> I asked you a question,<br> Mr Riley - again.<br> Please inform your client that he's<br> obligated to answer my question.<br> Let the record show<br> that the witness<br> emptied a glass of water<br> on my conference table.<br> What exactly do you intend to say<br> to me by pouring water on my table?<br> It's how silicone<br> is used to waterproof leather.<br> I'm answering your question.<br> It's poured on,<br> like you poured water on my table.<br> Yeah. Correct.<br> So some of it must<br> spill off the leather,<br> Like the water spilling<br> off my table...<br> and onto my rug.<br> That's the part I'm interested in.<br> The spilled silicone<br> and trichloroethylene, sir,<br> how you disposed of that.<br> - I never once used TCE.<br> - TCE? Did I say TCE?<br> I didn't say TCE.<br> I said trichloroethylene.<br> You said TCE -<br> as it is commonly known...<br> to those who know it.<br> Mr Riley, would you mind if<br> I checked your statements today<br> against your records - invoices,<br> purchase orders and formulas?<br> No. Be my guest.<br> They go back... three years.<br> Everything before that, we dumped.<br> - Jan, you're not listening.<br> - You've been out there three times.<br> I know why<br> you find this unacceptable.<br> But you don't know what it's like.<br> Riley is Woburn.<br> His employees are loyal subjects.<br> They won't talk.<br> Ex-employees, that's who<br> you should be talking to.<br> - Disgruntled employees, they talk.<br> - You want me to go back there?<br> This is THE case against Beatrice.<br> He's a liar. Go back and catch him.<br> - You got the medical records?<br> - I can't...<br> Just get it.<br> This figure here,<br> this 100 an hour for Dr Cohen,<br> that seems fair,<br> considering his pre-eminence.<br> That's for his nights in the hotel.<br> That's his discount sleeping rate.<br> - Your doctors have cost 900,000.<br> - They're worth it.<br> - Your geologists over 500,000.<br> - They're worth it.<br> The point is, everybody here<br> is working on this case.<br> There's no money coming in -<br> just going out.<br> You want to cut our losses now?<br> You want to get out<br> and throw away 900 and... what?<br> There's certain things<br> I've got to prove<br> and I can't do that<br> not spending money.<br> We have to see Uncle Pete.<br> - Where are we on the last loan...<br> - Spent it.<br> - How much of it?<br> - All of it.<br> And the Carney settlement?<br> How much...<br> - Spent it.<br> - On?<br> Woburn.<br> We spend everything on Woburn now.<br> On Woburn.<br> What will you need<br> to tide you over? Two hundred?<br> - 600,000?<br> - Yeah.<br> Pete, when was the last time<br> you lost money betting on me?<br> Never. I'm probably the best<br> investment your bank ever made.<br> How do vampires<br> get around on Halloween?<br> - Pass.<br> - Blood vessels.<br> Let's go.<br> - Bye, Dad.<br> - See you later. Goodbye.<br> Love you.<br> I thought about<br> seeing you for a long time.<br> I was afraid to 'cause... l didn't<br> think you'd want to talk to me,<br> 'cause of where I work<br> and everything.<br> I'm concerned about what's been<br> happening around here and...<br> I'm angry at the way<br> the company's handling itself.<br> I'm very sorry about your son.<br> Thank you.<br> He said he never dumped anything,<br> never did anything like that,<br> never saw anybody who did.<br> Tommy Barbas lied.<br> So did Paul Shalline.<br> Tommy, Paul and Joey<br> were out back all the time...<br> - Joey?<br> - Joey Miola, plant maintenance.<br> And the rumor is,<br> there's 50 more barrels buried<br> that the inspectors didn't find.<br> - 50?<br> - Or more. Here.<br> OK. Is there anyone else<br> at the plant that might talk to me?<br> I don't think so.<br> Bobby Pasqueriella.<br> Bobby?<br> He might. He doesn't<br> work there any more though.<br> Could you call him?<br> Yeah, that's the stuff got dumped.<br> All the time. Threw it<br> back there myself all the time.<br> Eddie Arsine - he'd say,<br> dump that stuff in the gully.<br> Out there in the gully, you know?<br> Dumped it back there<br> in the gully right there.<br> Washed belts and gearboxes with it,<br> and threw it in the gully.<br> He'd say, dump it out<br> in the gully, like Joey.<br> - Did Tom Barbas?<br> - Tommy? No, not Tommy, no.<br> - Never did that?<br> - No, no.<br> He dumped his in a ditch.<br> Mr Barbas, I understand you've had<br> a chance to think about things<br> since your first deposition.<br> He says you said<br> to pour it into the pit.<br> Is that how you remember it now?<br> He just said, go out<br> and dig a trench...30 feet long.<br> Load the barrels onto the truck,<br> drive out and dump it<br> into the swimming pool.<br> That's what we called it -<br> the swimming pool.<br> Right.<br> Mr Cheeseman, well done.<br> The odds of a plaintiff's lawyer<br> winning in court<br> are 2 to 1 against.<br> Think about that for a second.<br> Your odds of surviving a game<br> of Russian roulette are better.<br> So why does anyone do it?<br> They don't. They settle.<br> Out of the 780,000 cases<br> filed each year,<br> The whole idea of lawsuits<br> is to settle,<br> to compel the other side to settle.<br> You do that by spending<br> more money than you should,<br> forcing them to spend<br> more money than they should.<br> And whoever<br> comes to their senses first...<br> loses.<br> Trials are a corruption<br> of the entire process.<br> And only fools with something<br> to prove end up ensnared in them.<br> When I say prove,<br> I don't mean about the case.<br> I mean about themselves.<br> Hey, old man, out of the way!<br> - How's business?<br> - It's good.<br> Is it? I was afraid, with<br> all these scientists and doctors,<br> a small firm like yours<br> might be in trouble.<br> I appreciate your concern.<br> We've got more than enough<br> to go the distance.<br> Are you sure? lf you realized<br> you miscalculated the arithmetic,<br> you'd be digging quarters<br> out the seats of your car.<br> - You don't have to worry, Jerry.<br> - That's a relief.<br> You know what? You don't want me<br> in this case. You've got Grace.<br> I'm only gonna hurt you.<br> So get rid of me.<br> Tell me what you've got so far,<br> I'll get a cheque cut - OK?<br> My expenses? You're offering<br> to cover my expenses?<br> Your expenses and your pride.<br> You think you're gonna put<br> those families on the stand.<br> They'll tell their stories<br> so the jury<br> pull out their handkerchiefs?<br> Do you really think<br> I'd let that happen?<br> I don't see how you can prevent it.<br> Of course you don't.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Jan, guess what?<br> Cheeseman wants to talk.<br> He wants a number. He wants out.<br> I'll meet you back here<br> at the office.<br> Jan, this is it. We've got them.<br> That's great.<br> Oh, baby. God, no!<br> Oh, God!<br> He said he'd be here.<br> Are the Red Sox in town?<br> Sorry I'm late. I got tied up. Yeah.<br> I was just given a chair<br> at Harvard, of all things.<br> You're kidding. Which chair?<br> It's black with arms, with my name on<br> a brass plate on the back.<br> From my students.<br> Jerry, ever thought about<br> getting yourself a new briefcase?<br> You don't change your socks<br> in the middle of the World Series.<br> Am I sitting in the right place?<br> Actually, we have a seat<br> for you here, but that's fine.<br> Nice pen.<br> - They're courtesy of the hotel.<br> - Really?<br> This is a good quality pen. Yeah.<br> - So?<br> - So, Bill...<br> How much did Grace make last year?<br> I have no idea.<br> But I have a feeling you do.<br> - What?<br> - 436 million.<br> Together, that's 634 million.<br> That's one year. That's net.<br> So, that's what they made.<br> What should they be made to pay<br> to compensate the families,<br> to provide for their<br> economic security in the future?<br> Don't forget to mention you -<br> compensating you.<br> And to make sure<br> that this doesn't happen again.<br> And another 25 million<br> to establish a research foundation<br> to study the links between<br> hazardous waste and illness.<br> And 1 .5 million per family<br> annually for 30 years.<br> Can I ask a question?<br> I'm sure everyone has questions.<br> What's yours, Jerry?<br> Can I have this?<br> Thank you.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Jan?<br> - Yes, Gordon?<br> What's the story?<br> - They don't want to end this.<br> - They don't...<br> You said this wouldn't go to trial.<br> You just made certain that it will.<br> Without consulting us, I might add.<br> They patronize us.<br> They think we're blackmailers.<br> They think they can buy us.<br> Yeah?<br> We can't afford a long trial.<br> Find a way<br> of getting some money, then.<br> - What do you suggest?<br> - Am I the financial advisor?<br> No, you're not.<br> This is the plan.<br> Start with scientific evidence.<br> Then the medical experts<br> and their evidence.<br> Then the parents,<br> then your testimony.<br> Your presence is very important.<br> It's where the jury<br> gets to know you.<br> If you're only there some days,<br> they'll ask "why? Does she care?"<br> I'll be there every day,<br> in the back left-hand corner.<br> Wherever you're comfortable.<br> That was our plan.<br> If we got separated in the grocery<br> store that's where we'd meet.<br> Oh, I see, I see.<br> In the end, when he was dying,<br> he said, I'll meet you in the<br> back left-hand corner of heaven.<br> All rise.<br> This court is now in session.<br> The Honorable<br> Walter J Skinner presiding.<br> Civil Action 841672.<br> Anderson and all versus<br> W.R. Grace and Beatrice Foods.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> there's a small town<br> north of Boston called Woburn.<br> Woburn is like many small towns.<br> It has homes, it has churches,<br> it has schools, it has industry.<br> But Woburn has something else.<br> It has more than its share<br> of sickness and death.<br> Small amounts of solvents<br> were left on the ground.<br> Why? To evaporate.<br> Did they? Yes.<br> These chemicals never reached<br> Wells G and H - we will show that.<br> And they never made anyone sick.<br> We will show that, too.<br> The idea of criminal court<br> is crime and punishment.<br> The idea of civil court<br> and personal injury law by nature -<br> though no-one says it,<br> least of all<br> the personal injury lawyer himself -<br> is money.<br> Money for suffering.<br> Money for death.<br> As if that<br> could somehow relieve suffering.<br> As if that could somehow<br> bring dead children back to life.<br> Every credit card application<br> we send, we get more in the mail.<br> Here's one from North Dakota.<br> Fill it out. Fill them all out.<br> It's the last great pyramid scheme.<br> The terrain of East Woburn was<br> actually shaped 12,000 years ago,<br> during the end of the last ice Age.<br> At this time, an immense glacier,<br> over a mile thick,<br> covered what is now New England.<br> Cancel The American Lawyer.<br> Cancel all the legal journals.<br> And tell the janitorial people<br> they're no longer required.<br> We'll empty our own ashtrays.<br> To understand what's going on<br> in the ground water system,<br> we must start with the soil itself.<br> These are soil samples...<br> So you see,<br> the Aberjona River valley...<br> I...l can't send you<br> the entire balance right now.<br> But perhaps we could work out<br> some sort of a deal.<br> How much can I send you right now?<br> Nothing.<br> A plaintiff's case<br> depends on momentum.<br> The fewer objections he gets,<br> the better his case will go.<br> So whenever you can,<br> you should object.<br> They're not even his witnesses,<br> they're his.<br> I can't not object when you<br> phrase questions improperly.<br> As a craftsman...<br> He is deliberately trying<br> to destroy the rhythm of my case.<br> Here we are. You must have<br> some good luck on these.<br> - Hold on. 17, 17, 17.<br> - You got a winner?<br> No! Shoot.<br> Relevance - objection.<br> Hearsay - objection.<br> Best evidence - objection.<br> Authenticity...<br> Objection.<br> If you fall asleep, the first thing<br> you say when you wake up is...<br> Objection.<br> Do you swear to tell<br> the whole truth, so help you God?<br> Yes.<br> Good morning, Mr Riley. Would<br> you care for a glass of water?<br> No, thank you.<br> Are you sure?<br> The single greatest liability<br> for a lawyer is pride.<br> Pride...<br> pride has lost more cases<br> than lousy evidence,<br> idiot witnesses and<br> a hanging judge put together.<br> There is absolutely no place<br> in a courtroom for pride.<br> Mr Riley, you own the property<br> referred to here as the 15 acres?<br> No, it's currently owned<br> by a non-profit corporation<br> called The Wildwood Conservancy.<br> Oh, yes. What is that?<br> The Wildwood Conservancy.<br> - Is that a conservation group?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I've donated the land as<br> a sanctuary for indigent wildlife.<br> I don't think the indigent wildlife<br> has heard about this, Mr Riley.<br> I've been there several times<br> and haven't seen any living thing.<br> He says no, no, no.<br> He says yes once, I've got him.<br> He's not that stupid.<br> Keep him there long enough,<br> he'll figure a way to get you.<br> I'm not that stupid.<br> Mr Riley, experts<br> have testified in this court<br> that your land, your 15 acres,<br> is the most grotesquely polluted<br> land in New England.<br> You have no idea how that happened?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Does it upset you to learn this?<br> - Very much so.<br> - Really? Why?<br> And one last thing,<br> unless you know exactly<br> what the answer is,<br> never, ever ask a witness "why".<br> Never.<br> My factory is the oldest<br> surviving business in Woburn.<br> When the other tanners moved out,<br> I stayed,<br> even though that was<br> a very big financial burden.<br> - That's not...<br> - Woburn is my home...<br> That's not the question.<br> He's trying to answer it,<br> Mr Schlichtmann. Let him.<br> That land has been in my family<br> for three generations.<br> That land to me is hallowed ground.<br> So when you ask me would I be upset<br> if someone desecrated it -<br> land that's part of the town<br> that I love -<br> my answer to your question,<br> Mr Schlichtmann...<br> is yes.<br> I have no further questions,<br> Your Honor.<br> The sad part is, they rob themselves<br> of the blessing of giving.<br> If somebody wrote a cheque<br> for the total budget of my church,<br> it wouldn't affect my giving.<br> Ain't nobody gonna rob me<br> of the blessing of giving!<br> You know why folks ain't getting?<br> 'Cause they ain't giving!<br> Do not rob yourself<br> of the blessing of giving.<br> You'll never guess what I did<br> last night. You'll like this.<br> I pledged 200 to a televangelist. I'm<br> not kidding.<br> He said,<br> "Give and ye shall receive."<br> I know. I know what you're thinking.<br> You're thinking, Gordon's losing it.<br> He's falling apart.<br> He's probably<br> buying lottery tickets.<br> I bought a few. I'll admit it.<br> I know, but seriously,<br> the jackpot's 45 million.<br> That's just this week!<br> You should see the lines out there.<br> - Is that a gun?<br> - What?<br> This? No. No, this is for you.<br> My Krugerrands.<br> I've had them forever.<br> I want you to have them.<br> And this is the deed to my house.<br> Here is Conway's<br> and Crowley's and Jan's.<br> See, I've come bearing gifts.<br> We really need the money.<br> You can tell your child isn't well.<br> "Has he got a temperature?" "No."<br> "He's all right, then", they say.<br> "Bring him to the clinic Monday."<br> He died Monday morning.<br> Start with Jimmy Anderson -<br> countless trips to hospital,<br> futile chemotherapy treatments.<br> Then the others, ending with Jared<br> Aufiero, dying on the highway.<br> Could somebody get that?<br> Where is everybody?<br> You're just noticing now? Gordon<br> laid everybody off two weeks ago.<br> Gordon, instead of sitting there<br> reading a magazine,<br> why not go to Uncle Pete<br> and get me a staff?<br> Good idea.<br> Why didn't I think of that?<br> Hello?<br> There was a Cheeseman<br> on the Mayflower.<br> - This way, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Jan, have a seat.<br> You want something to drink?<br> Some coffee? Soda?<br> You've been talking<br> without me present?<br> No, we have been drinking coffee<br> without your being present.<br> Don't be so paranoid.<br> They were early.<br> - All right. What's up?<br> - Jerry?<br> Last night, I was at a ball game.<br> It was the seventh innings<br> and I was standing there,<br> and it occurred to me<br> at that moment,<br> unless you've proven that any...<br> What word should we use?<br> - Chemicals?<br> - Poisons.<br> If you like that word, I'll use it.<br> Unless you've proven that poisons<br> reached the wells, there's no case.<br> And therefore,<br> no need to make these families,<br> who've already suffered so much,<br> relive their suffering<br> all over again<br> by putting them on the stand.<br> - Your Honor, you've...<br> - That's interesting.<br> - What?<br> - I'd have to agree with that.<br> Your Honor, the...<br> If the jury decides favorably<br> on the geological evidence,<br> you could bring your families in.<br> Your Honor, the jury<br> was expecting a human drama.<br> For three months<br> they've had lessons in geology.<br> We had to do that.<br> Now it's over - finally.<br> Now we have to see where we are<br> before moving on,<br> and subjecting these families<br> to more trauma than necessary,<br> because that would just be cruel.<br> - They want to testify.<br> - The decision is made.<br> - It's the defendant's plan.<br> - It's my plan.<br> Right from the beginning,<br> he threatened...<br> It's MY plan!<br> Now...<br> my plan is to present the jury<br> with some simple questions.<br> How you answer<br> these three questions,<br> will determine whether<br> this trial continues.<br> I don't disagree -<br> I don't understand them.<br> What don't you understand?<br> They're straightforward questions.<br> Have the plaintiffs established,<br> by preponderance of evidence,<br> that chemicals containing TCE<br> were disposed of on these lands<br> after October 1, 1964<br> and August 27, 1968, respectively,<br> and did those chemicals contribute<br> to the well water contamination?<br> What were these dates?<br> Where are they from? Out of a hat?<br> Question two.<br> What, according to<br> a preponderance of the evidence,<br> was the earliest time<br> at which these chemicals<br> substantially contributed<br> to the wells' contamination?<br> How can they determine that?<br> Science can't even determine<br> when the chemicals arrived<br> with the precision<br> that you're asking of the jurors.<br> And finally, three.<br> What, according to<br> a preponderance of the evidence,<br> was the earliest time -<br> again, month and year -<br> at which substantial contribution<br> referred to in question two<br> was caused, if it was,<br> by the negligent conduct<br> of the defendants?<br> It's like English translated into<br> Japanese back into English again.<br> I've heard enough.<br> Your Honor,<br> no one can answer these.<br> You're asking for answers<br> that are unknowable.<br> I've heard enough.<br> You're asking for a fiction<br> that stands for truth, but isn't.<br> Enough!<br> Once again, I remind you not<br> to discuss your views outside,<br> and excuse you...<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Everything's under control.<br> And excuse you<br> to your deliberations. Thank you.<br> I've never done this.<br> In 45 years of practicing,<br> I've never<br> waited in a corridor for a jury.<br> - I always do.<br> - I can tell.<br> You're good at it.<br> You seem so at peace doing it.<br> What do you think?<br> ls it good they're out this long?<br> - For who?<br> - For me, of course.<br> You can never tell.<br> It could mean anything.<br> It could mean jury duty's more fun<br> than working at the post office.<br> - It's bad for both of you.<br> - You think?<br> Well, here's my take.<br> Guilty.<br> Not guilty.<br> That's what they're going to say.<br> Nothing to do with dates<br> or ground-water measurements<br> or any of that crap,<br> which nobody understands anyway.<br> It's going to come down to people,<br> like always.<br> You found someone<br> who saw him dumping stuff.<br> You didn't find anyone who saw me.<br> - What's your take?<br> - They'll see the truth.<br> The truth?<br> We're talking about a court of law.<br> You've been around<br> long enough to know<br> courtrooms aren't<br> where you look for the truth.<br> You're lucky to find anything<br> that even resembles the truth.<br> You disagree. Well, since when?<br> Eight kids are dead, Jerry.<br> Jan, that suit fits you better<br> than the sentimentality.<br> That's not how you<br> made all that money, is it?<br> It wasn't about dead children from<br> the minute you filed the complaint.<br> The minute it entered<br> the justice system. Oh, yes.<br> I know you like to gamble.<br> High-stakes gambler,<br> that's your profession.<br> Why not test your faith<br> in the righteousness of our courts<br> with a high-stakes gamble?<br> If that's a settlement offer,<br> Jerry, it's not enough.<br> - That's not what I hear.<br> - Who said that?<br> The IRS, telling us they have<br> a lien on any eventual settlement<br> in order to recover<br> over 2.5 million in unpaid taxes.<br> But all right...<br> What if I would add<br> six zeros onto that?<br> That would be - what? - 20 million.<br> Now, that would put things<br> in perspective, wouldn't it?<br> As far as truth, justice<br> and dead children go?<br> If you want to talk<br> about a settlement,<br> get the decision-makers together<br> and talk seriously.<br> The decision-makers are here,<br> aren't they?<br> You're looking at Mr Beatrice.<br> I don't have to call anybody. Do you?<br> It's just you and me.<br> We're like kings. We are kings.<br> Sitting in our castle,<br> deciding important things.<br> Deciding the fates of others.<br> And counting money.<br> In our counting room!<br> Tell you what. I'll leave this here,<br> go back down the hall<br> to my throne room<br> and await your decision.<br> If you really want the truth, Jan,<br> Look for it where it is -<br> at the bottom of a bottomless pit.<br> Mr Foreman, members of the jury, have<br> you reached a verdict?<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> With respect to W.R. Grace,<br> the jury has answered...<br> "yes" to question one regarding<br> trichloroethylene contamination,<br> requiring the case against Grace<br> to go to a second stage<br> of this trial.<br> In regard to Beatrice, the jury<br> has answered "no" to question one<br> in all its points<br> pertaining to contamination<br> which renders questions two<br> and three inapplicable,<br> ending the case against Beatrice.<br> - Mr Facher, you're excused.<br> - Thank you, Your Honor.<br> We are going to take<br> a break now, until after lunch.<br> Once again, I remind you<br> not to talk to anyone<br> about your deliberations here...<br> Disappointed?<br> Not at all. This is a victory.<br> This sends a message that companies<br> can no longer get away with this.<br> - So what now?<br> - Right now?<br> I think we should celebrate.<br> What do you think? Yes?<br> You'll proceed against Grace,<br> no matter how long it takes?<br> We have to<br> get out of this case fast.<br> That's our only strategy left.<br> The good news is<br> Grace wants to talk.<br> They want us to see their executive<br> vice-president, AI Eustis.<br> So we need to know<br> what our squeal point is.<br> will just about get us out of hock.<br> Gordon knows the numbers.<br> Jan, every dollar we spend<br> is a dollar we don't have.<br> We are floating on credit<br> without a net.<br> I don't need a net.<br> Mortgage my house. I don't care.<br> I have.<br> And Kevin's and Bill's and mine.<br> I've cashed in our retirement plans<br> and life-insurance. And it's gone.<br> Let me put it this way,<br> if we can't appear we've got money<br> they won't give us 8 million.<br> They won't give us eight cents.<br> You know that.<br> You all know that.<br> It's our nicest suite.<br> Living room, dining room,<br> two bedrooms, a den, a lovely view.<br> It's 2,400 a night.<br> For our inner strength.<br> - On the card.<br> - Why not?<br> Farmers' Bank of Iowa.<br> Hey, there!<br> - Jan Schlichtmann.<br> - AI Eustis.<br> How are you?<br> Sorry I'm late. I got lost.<br> - Got lost?<br> - Yes.<br> How did you manage that?<br> I've never been here before so...<br> What kind of Harvard man are you?<br> The Cornell kind.<br> Cornell?<br> I thought you went to Harvard?<br> I'm sure somebody said that<br> you went to Harvard! Cornell!<br> Yes.<br> Well, listen, Cornell is...<br> is a damn good school.<br> Damn good.<br> So what do you want?<br> Well, I could take you<br> through it step by step<br> or you could take<br> this with you and study it.<br> It's a little complicated but...<br> It's an unspoken rule<br> of the Harvard Club -<br> business is never transacted here.<br> I meant, what do you want to drink?<br> I wanted to reach across<br> and strangle him with his tie.<br> Instead, I sat there for two hours<br> and listened to him<br> talk about selling his yacht.<br> You know, sometimes<br> I actually prefer the 35-footer.<br> Because I can crew it myself,<br> I can be all by myself out there<br> alone. It's magnificent.<br> And there's no... Nobody can<br> call you. Nobody can beep you.<br> Nobody can fax you.<br> There's no lawsuits.<br> You know what I'm talking about.<br> You sail?<br> - No.<br> - You don't sail?<br> - Finally, we went to his office.<br> - Let's sit down.<br> Come on. It's more comfortable.<br> Have a seat.<br> He comes around the desk,<br> he sits down.<br> Go ahead, sit down.<br> He puts his feet up<br> on this French antique thing<br> and he tells me to put my feet up.<br> Put your feet up. Come on.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - No, go ahead.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - No, really, I'm fine.<br> Nothing's going to break.<br> Put them up.<br> It was weird - all this talk about<br> putting my feet on this table.<br> It's all right - I mean it.<br> Try it. Come on.<br> Put your feet up.<br> There. Now, I can afford to pay you<br> almost anything you ask.<br> It's not the money.<br> But a settlement that high<br> says we're guilty.<br> That says to every two-bit<br> personal injury lawyer in Boston,<br> let's sign up everyone in Woburn.<br> Creates a shark effect,<br> and that I can't afford.<br> Give me a number.<br> I'm not negotiating with myself, Al,<br> throwing out numbers<br> you can say no to.<br> - You give me one.<br> - 8 million.<br> He said 8 million?<br> I can't go to the families<br> with that.<br> Wait! What? Who? What families?<br> I can't go to them empty-handed.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Since when is that empty-handed?<br> I owe them more than that.<br> What do you owe them?<br> Do you owe them your career?<br> You're talking<br> about our careers here!<br> - You owe them that?<br> - And OUR families!<br> That's what we're talking here.<br> Our families...<br> Don't do it.<br> Don't go for broke on this one.<br> It isn't worth it, Jan.<br> Nobody calls any more?<br> Not even the creditors.<br> Are the phones still working?<br> Schlichtmann, Conway and Crowley.<br> Just a moment, please.<br> Someone named Grendan.<br> Creditor.<br> - Are you here?<br> - Do I look like I'm here?<br> He's in a meeting at the moment.<br> Do me a favor, Gordon? Shut up.<br> What?<br> I'm tired of hearing you<br> moan about money.<br> This isn't about money any more.<br> No? What's it about?<br> What's it about, Jan?<br> - Look, let's all...<br> - No, I want to know.<br> I want to know what I gave up<br> my house for - my credit, my life!<br> Would you take 10 million?<br> - Yes.<br> - But not eight?<br> No.<br> So 10 million<br> is some mythic struggle,<br> but eight is just another lawsuit!<br> If they're willing to pay eight<br> then it's not enough.<br> - That makes sense!<br> - It makes perfect sense.<br> So you'll only accept<br> what they won't give us?<br> Listen to yourself!<br> I'm sick of listening to you.<br> I've lost enough because of you.<br> You'd have nothing but for me.<br> All you have, I got for you!<br> I don't have anything!<br> What do I have?<br> I got a couple of bucks<br> and some bus transfers.<br> I've got a savings account<br> from when I was 12.<br> Here - there's 37 in here.<br> With interest after 25 years,<br> probably 47!<br> Take it! Add it to the war chest.<br> Use it to fight injustice!<br> Go down in flames with it<br> for all I care.<br> Only next time...<br> Next time - that's a laugh!<br> Ask us if we want<br> to go down with you!<br> I'd like to leave a message<br> for AI Eustis, please.<br> I've been informed that a settlement<br> agreement has been reached.<br> As a condition of this agreement,<br> the exact terms shall remain<br> private among the parties involved.<br> Thank you for your service...<br> Our contingency fee,<br> as you know, as you agreed to -<br> or 2.2 million.<br> Our expenses - what we actually<br> paid out trying this case -<br> comes to 3.5 million.<br> and dividing it equally,<br> comes out to 375,000 per family.<br> And they're<br> gonna clean the place up?<br> No.<br> When you first came out here,<br> Mr Schlichtmann,<br> when we first spoke, I told you<br> I wasn't interested in money.<br> Here it comes.<br> What I wanted<br> was an apology from someone<br> for what they did to my son.<br> And you said, money is the apology.<br> That's how they apologize -<br> with their chequebooks.<br> Would you call this an apology?<br> No.<br> The only meaningful apology<br> you're going to get is from me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm afraid that isn't meaningful.<br> Mrs Anderson, you're looking<br> at four guys who are broke.<br> We lost everything trying this case.<br> How can you even begin<br> to compare what you've lost<br> to what we've lost?<br> Listen, the minute you put money<br> on the table, things turn ugly.<br> It happens every time. Forget it.<br> But she's right.<br> She's not right.<br> It's cold. It's wet. We're<br> in the swamp. I want to go home.<br> Someone out here saw what happened.<br> You can't do what Riley did<br> without somebody seeing it.<br> You're talking about the case.<br> The case is over.<br> Yeah, I know. They want out, right?<br> It's time they went<br> their separate way.<br> You know what I think of that?<br> Fine. Let 'em.<br> - I can imagine worse things.<br> - Like what?<br> So what if we have to start over?<br> We did it once.<br> We can do it again, the two of us.<br> Oh, I see. When you say it's over,<br> you mean it's over.<br> It's time for me<br> to go my separate way.<br> You always went<br> your separate way, Jan.<br> Thank you.<br> This is how silicone is<br> put on leather to waterproof it.<br> Like you poured water on my table.<br> Yeah.<br> So some of it must<br> spill off the leather,<br> like the water<br> spilling off my table.<br> That's the part I'm interested in.<br> The spilled silicone<br> and trichloroethylene, sir -<br> how you disposed of that.<br> We're just here<br> to look at your records.<br> I didn't call him, he just came.<br> - You just let him in?<br> - Of course I did.<br> You know how sometimes<br> you get so close to something<br> that you lose sight of it?<br> I kept looking for someone<br> who saw Riley dumping<br> barrels of poison, when l...<br> I should've been looking for someone<br> who helped him clean it up.<br> Why did you rent two dump trucks<br> and a front loader in October '81?<br> Or is this just<br> part of your job at the tannery?<br> - Mr Granger?<br> - I don't have to talk to you.<br> I can tell you to leave<br> and I'd be within my rights.<br> Yes, you would.<br> In the fall of 1981, Mr Riley<br> instructed me to rent a loader<br> and two 10-wheel dump trucks.<br> - Did he tell you why?<br> - Yes, he did.<br> Everything goes. I don't want<br> to see anything but topsoil.<br> Didn't it seem strange<br> that he had to get rid of it now?<br> I don't want to know where.<br> Just take it.<br> He told me city inspectors<br> were coming.<br> He didn't want them to see it.<br> This went on for several nights.<br> Fill the trucks, trucks drive off,<br> trucks come back empty,<br> we fill them up again.<br> On the last night...<br> On the last night, what?<br> Are you sure you didn't<br> see some kids there?<br> - Lighting fires, drinking beers?<br> - I've nothing to say.<br> It'd be hard to forget.<br> You know, it's a...<br> Apparently, it was quite a sight.<br> Go, go, go.<br> Watch out!<br> This is private property!<br> You little punks!<br> That's you!<br> You know, mister, I'm sorry.<br> Here's something to make up for it.<br> There you go! There - fry!<br> I'll have you arrested!<br> It's like that now!<br> You want some of that? Eat it!<br> Let's go! Let's go!<br> - Get the fuck out!<br> - Come on.<br> Did Riley threaten you at all<br> with what might happen to you<br> if you ever came forward?<br> No, sir.<br> He didn't say anything<br> at all in this regard?<br> He gave me<br> a couple of Celtics tickets.<br> Told me to keep my mouth shut.<br> The appeals process<br> is even more Byzantine<br> than the trial it's appealing.<br> It takes longer, it costs more,<br> its outcome is even less promising.<br> Only five cases in 50<br> will win in appeals court,<br> odds as easy to calculate<br> as they are discouraging.<br> They're 10 to 1 against.<br> Just about any bet at any table<br> in any casino<br> anywhere in the world...<br> is better than that.<br> I have the evidence but not the<br> resources or the gambling spirit<br> to appeal the decision in this case.<br> I have no money, no partners,<br> and, it seems, no clients any more.<br> The Woburn case has become what it<br> was when it first came to me -<br> an orphan.<br> I'm forwarding it on to you,<br> knowing you may not want it<br> any more than I did at first.<br> If you do decide to take it on,<br> I hope you'll be able to succeed<br> where I've failed.<br> If you calculate success<br> and failure as I always have,<br> in money divided neatly<br> into human suffering,<br> the arithmetic says...<br> I failed completely.<br> What it doesn't say<br> is if I could go back,<br> knowing what I know now and where<br> I'd end up if I got involved,<br> knowing all the numbers,<br> all the odds,<br> all the angles...<br> I'd do it again.<br> Sorry.<br> Jesus!<br> I'm sorry. Yes?<br> The purpose of these questions<br> is not to humiliate you,<br> but to verify<br> the assets that you've declared.<br> I understand.<br> Because what you're asking<br> your creditors to believe is...<br> - Well, it's hard to believe.<br> - I know.<br> After 17 years of practicing law,<br> all you have to show for it is...<br> and a portable radio?<br> That's correct.<br> Where did it all go?<br> The money?<br> The money, the property,<br> the personal belongings.<br> The things one acquires<br> in one's life, Mr Schlichtmann.<br> The things by which<br> one measures one's life.<br> What happened?<br>
