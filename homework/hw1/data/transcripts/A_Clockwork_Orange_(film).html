You' re undernourished.<br> So after each meal<br> we'll give you a shot.<br> Roll over on your right side.<br> Loosen your pajama pants<br> and pull them halfway down .<br> What exactly is the treatment here<br> going to be, then?<br> It's quite simple, really.<br> We' re going to show you some films.<br> You mean, like<br> going to the pictures?<br> Something like that.<br> That's good.<br> I like to viddy<br> the old films now and again .<br> And viddy films I would.<br> Where I was taken to, brothers...<br> ... was like no cine<br> I ever viddied before.<br> I was bound up<br> in a straitjacket...<br> ...and my gulliver was strapped<br> to a headrest...<br> ... with wires running away from it.<br> Then they clamped, like,<br> lid-locks on me eyes...<br> ...so that I could not shut them,<br> no matter how hard I tried.<br> It seemed a bit crazy to me...<br> ...but I let them get on with<br> what they wanted to get on with.<br> If I was to be a free malchick<br> again in a fortnight...<br> ...l would put up with much<br> in the meantime, my brothers.<br> The first film was a very good,<br> professional piece of cine...<br> ...like it was done in Hollywood.<br> The sounds were real horrorshow.<br> You could slooshy the screams<br> and moans very realistic.<br> You could even get<br> the breathing and panting...<br> ...of the tolchocking malchicks<br> at the same time.<br> And then what do you know?<br> Soon our dear old friend...<br> ...the red, red vino on tap...<br> ...the same in all places...<br> ...like it's put out<br> by the same firm...<br> ...began to flow.<br> It was beautiful.<br> It's funny how the colors<br> of the real world...<br> ...only seem really real...<br> ... when you viddy them<br> on a screen.<br> Now, all the time<br> I was watching this...<br> ...l was beginning<br> to get very aware...<br> ...of, like, not feeling<br> all that well.<br> And this I put down<br> to all the rich food and vitamins.<br> But I tried to forget this,<br> concentrating on the next film...<br> ... which jumped right away<br> on a young devotchka...<br> ... who was being given<br> the old in-out, in-out...<br> ...first by one malchick...<br> ...then another.<br> Then another.<br> When it came to<br> the 6th or 7th malchick...<br> ...leering and smecking<br> and then going into it...<br> ...l began to feel really sick.<br> But I could not shut me glazzies.<br> And even if I tried to move<br> my glazzballs about...<br> ...l still could not get out of. ..<br> ...the line of fire<br> of this picture.<br> Get me up.<br> I' m going to be sick.<br> Get something for me to be sick in !<br> Very soon now,<br> the drug will cause the subject. . .<br> . . .to experience<br> a deathlike paralysis. . .<br> . . .together with deep feelings<br> of terror and helplessness.<br> One of our early test subjects. . . .<br> . . .described it as being like death .<br> A sense of stifling or drowning.<br> And it is during this period,<br> we have found. . .<br> . . .the subject will make<br> his most rewarding associations. . .<br> . . .between his catastrophic<br> experience, environment. . .<br> . . .and the violence he sees.<br> Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you .<br> You've made<br> a very positive response.<br> Tomorrow there will be two<br> sessions, morning and afternoon .<br> You mean I have to viddy<br> two sessions in one day?<br> I imagine you'll feel a bit<br> limp by the end of the day.<br> But we have to be hard on you .<br> You have to be cured.<br> It was horrible.<br> Of course it was horrible.<br> Violence is a very horrible thing.<br> That's what you' re learning now .<br> Your body's learning it.<br> I just don't understand about<br> feeling sick the way I did.<br> I never used to feel sick.<br> I used to feel the very opposite.<br> Doing it or watching it,<br> I used to feel real horrorshow .<br> You felt ill this afternoon<br> because you' re getting better.<br> When we' re healthy,<br> we respond to the hateful . . .<br> . . .with fear and nausea.<br> You' re becoming healthy,<br> that's all .<br> By this time tomorrow,<br> you'll be healthier still .<br> It was the next day, brothers...<br> ...and I had truly done my best...<br> ...morning and afternoon<br> to play it their way...<br> ...and sit like a horrorshow<br> cooperative malchick...<br> ...in the chair of torture...<br> ... while they flashed nasty bits<br> of ultra-violence on the screen...<br> ...though not on the soundtrack,<br> the only sound being music.<br> Then I noticed,<br> in all my pain and sickness...<br> ... what music it was<br> that, like, cracked and boomed.<br> It was Ludwig van.<br> Ninth Symphony.<br> Fourth movement.<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> Please, I beg you !<br> It's a sin !<br> It's a sin !<br> It's a sin !<br> It's a sin ! It's a sin !<br> It's a sin !<br> Sin?<br> What's all this about sin?<br> That!<br> Using Ludwig van like that.<br> He did no harm to anyone.<br> Beethoven just wrote music.<br> Are you referring<br> to the background score?<br> You've heard Beethoven before?<br> So you' re keen on music?<br> Can't be helped.<br> Here's the punishment<br> element perhaps.<br> The governor ought to be pleased.<br> I' m sorry, Alex.<br> This is for your own good.<br> You'll have to bear with us<br> for a while.<br> But it's not fair. It's not fair<br> I should feel ill when I hear. . .<br> . . .Lovely, lovely, Ludwig van .<br> You must take your chance, boy.<br> The choice has been all yours.<br> You needn't take it<br> any further, sir.<br> You've proved to me all this<br> ultra-violence and killing. . .<br> . . .is wrong, wrong<br> and terribly wrong!<br> I've learned me lesson, sir.<br> I see now what I've<br> never seen before.<br> I' m cured.<br> Praise God!<br> You' re not cured yet, boy.<br> But, sirs.<br> Missus!<br> I see that it's wrong!<br> It's wrong because<br> it's, like, against society.<br> Because everybody has the<br> right to live and be happy. . .<br> . . .without being<br> tolchocked and knifed!<br> No, no, boy.<br> You really must leave it to us.<br> But be cheerful about it.<br> In less than a fortnight now,<br> you'll be a free man .<br> Ladies and gentlemen . . .<br> . . .at this stage we introduce<br> the subject himself.<br> He is, as you will perceive,<br> fit and well-nourished.<br> He comes straight from a night's<br> sleep and a good breakfast. . .<br> . . .undrugged. . .<br> . . .unhypnotized.<br> Tomorrow we send him out with<br> confidence into the world again . . .<br> . . .as decent a lad as you<br> would meet on a May morning.<br> What a change is here,<br> ladies and gentlemen .<br> From the hoodlum<br> the state committed. . .<br> . . .to unprofitable punishment<br> some two years ago.<br> Unchanged after two years.<br> Unchanged, do I say?<br> Not quite.<br> Prison taught him the false smile,<br> the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.<br> The fawning, greased,<br> obsequious leer.<br> Other vices it taught him. . .<br> . . .as well as confirming him in<br> those he had long practiced before.<br> Our party promised<br> to restore law and order. . .<br> . . .and to make the streets safe for<br> the ordinary peace-loving citizen .<br> This pledge is now<br> about to become a reality.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> today is an historic moment.<br> The problem of criminal violence<br> is soon to be a thing of the past.<br> But enough of words.<br> Actions speak louder than .<br> Action now .<br> Observe all .<br> Our necks are out<br> a long way on this, Minister.<br> I have complete faith in Brodsky.<br> If the polls are right,<br> we have nothing to lose.<br> Hello, heap of dirt.<br> You don't wash much, do you?<br> Judging by the horrible smell .<br> Why do you say that?<br> I had a shower this morning.<br> He had a shower this morning.<br> You trying to call me a liar?<br> No, brother.<br> You must think I' m awfully stupid.<br> Why did you do that, brother?<br> I've never done wrong to you .<br> You want to know why I did that?<br> Well, you see. . .<br> . . .I do this. . .<br> . . .and that. . .<br> . . .and this because I don't like<br> your horrible type, do l?<br> And if you want<br> to start something. . .<br> . . .you just go ahead.<br> Go on !<br> Please do!<br> I' m going to be sick.<br> You' re going to be sick, are you?<br> I' m going to be sick.<br> Please let me get up.<br> You want to get up?<br> Well, now you listen to me.<br> If you want to get up. . .<br> . . .you've got to<br> do something for me.<br> Here.<br> Here.<br> You see that?<br> You see that shoe?<br> I want you to lick it.<br> Go on !<br> Lick it.<br> And, O my brothers,<br> would you believe...<br> ...your faithful friend<br> and long-suffering narrator...<br> ...pushed out his red yabzick<br> a mile and a half. ..<br> ...to lick the grahzny,<br> vonny boots.<br> And again !<br> The horrible killing sickness<br> had whooshed up...<br> ...and turned the joy of battle...<br> ...into a feeling<br> I was going to snuff it.<br> And again .<br> Nice and clean .<br> Thank you very much .<br> That will do very well .<br> Thank you very much,<br> ladies and gentlemen .<br> She came towards me...<br> ... with the light like it was the<br> light light of heavenly grace.<br> And the thing that flashed<br> in me gulliver...<br> ... was that I'd like to have her<br> there on the floor...<br> ... with the old in-out.<br> Real savage.<br> But quick as a shot<br> came the sickness.<br> Like a detective who'd been<br> watching around the corner...<br> ...and now followed<br> to make his arrest.<br> Enough .<br> Thank you very much .<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> Not feeling too bad now, are you?<br> No, sir.<br> I feel really great, sir.<br> -Good.<br> -Was it all right, sir?<br> Did I do well?<br> Fine, my boy.<br> Absolutely fine.<br> You see, ladies and gentlemen . . .<br> . . .our subject is impelled<br> towards the good. . .<br> . . .by paradoxically<br> being impelled towards evil .<br> The intention to act violently. . .<br> . . .is accompanied by strong<br> feelings of physical distress.<br> To counter these,<br> the subject has to switch . . .<br> . . .to a diametrically<br> opposed attitude.<br> Any questions?<br> Choice.<br> The boy has no real choice, has he?<br> Self-interest.<br> The fear of physical pain . . .<br> . . .drove him to that<br> grotesque act of self-abasement.<br> Its insincerity<br> was clearly to be seen .<br> He ceases to be a wrongdoer.<br> He ceases also to be<br> a creature capable of moral choice.<br> Padre, these are subtleties.<br> We' re not concerned with motives,<br> with the higher ethics.<br> We are concerned only<br> with cutting down crime.<br> And with relieving the ghastly<br> congestion in our prisons.<br> He will be your true Christian . . .<br> . . .ready to turn the other cheek.<br> Ready to be crucified,<br> rather than crucify.<br> Sick to the very heart at the<br> thought even of killing a fly.<br> Reclamation .<br> Joy before the angels of God.<br> The point is that it works!<br> And the very next day,<br> your friend and humble narrator...<br> ... was a free man.<br> Son !<br> Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.<br> Mum.<br> How are you, love?<br> Nice to see you .<br> -Dad.<br> -Lad.
