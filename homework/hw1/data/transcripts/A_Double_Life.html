Good-bye.<br> I'll be seeing you.<br> Good-bye, Tony.<br> What a darling.<br> Stinker.<br> What?<br> What?<br> Hello, mr. John.<br> Hello, Anna.<br> Hello, Max.<br> Enter Anthony John -<br> tall, handsome, charming.<br> Shakes hands with his<br> dearest friend and mentor<br> and sits.<br> How did it go last night?<br> Fine, fine.<br> "A riot. A veritable funfest."<br> This play agrees with you.<br> Ah, good old Anna -<br> never forgets.<br> If it were possible,<br> I'd have you only in<br> comedy always, so help me.<br> Well, why isn't it?<br> Every morning after I get up,<br> I read a play,<br> every night before I go to bed,<br> and out of the lot,<br> if one turns up<br> that can be produced<br> and that's got a part<br> for you, I'm lucky.<br> Listen. Do me a favor.<br> Don't forget one thing -<br> you're an actor.<br> You don't say.<br> A great actor.<br> I bow.<br> You got a responsibility.<br> You can't stop. You<br> can't limit yourself.<br> All right.<br> Don't get so excited.<br> Well,<br> I'm an excitable fellow.<br> Come on.<br> Let's have it.<br> What is all this?<br> Othello.<br> Oh! Ho ho! No!<br> I was looking over<br> that old Othello<br> scheme of yours.<br> You don't know<br> how good that is.<br> Yes, we did have some<br> good notions, all right.<br> Good?<br> Do you remember that thing<br> you figured out<br> for the ending?<br> Yes.<br> Where you strangle<br> Desdemona with a kiss?<br> Yes. Oh, it sounds<br> ridiculous now.<br> You're wrong.<br> It's brilliant,<br> and it's believable,<br> isn't it, Victor?<br> Isn't what?<br> Isn't it brilliant?<br> Also believable.<br> The Othello thing.<br> How are you, Tony?<br> Blooming -<br> blooming in spite of Max.<br> He's been giving me<br> a scream-by-scream description<br> of my own idea.<br> Want to do it, Tony?<br> Do you want to direct it?<br> I asked you first.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know. I?<br> I know some parts<br> give me the willies,<br> on the stage and off.<br> Where's your ambition?<br> All used up, Max.<br> Well, almost all used up.<br> Well, I've come<br> a long way with it.<br> Remember when I was<br> that handsome juvenile<br> dashing on with white flannels<br> and a tennis racket?<br> "I say, tennis anyone?<br> Right-o. Let's have<br> another go at it."<br> Yes, and before that,<br> the chorus of the student prince.<br> I tell you, I was<br> a happy hambone then.<br> Vocabulary of 7 words.<br> Funny, I remember<br> my father even then,<br> coming backstage for a touch.<br> And telling me<br> to get the best of it.<br> "Get the best of it, boy-boy.<br> never made it, see,<br> but you can do it, kid.<br> You can do it<br> For the two of us."<br> So I'd slip him a fin,<br> and he'd mosey off.<br> I never listened to him.<br> I never listened<br> to anyone but Brita.<br> That's when I got<br> ambition, my boy?<br> When I married Brita.<br> That's when I wanted<br> to be something better<br> than I was,<br> to be an actor, a real actor.<br> I had to teach myself<br> to talk, do you know it?<br> And move and think.<br> I had to tear myself apart<br> and put myself together<br> again and again.<br> The leftover pieces<br> are all scattered<br> somewhere between here<br> and a thousand one-night stands.<br> Oh, sure, I lost plenty?<br> Fun and rest and friends<br> and privacy,<br> and in that cockeyed way<br> things have of working out,<br> it's even cost me Brita.<br> Would you like to hear<br> the story of my life?<br> He was a good actor,<br> your old man.<br> Oh, thank you, Max,<br> but you and I both know<br> he died a doorman.<br> Look, I wish you'd drop in<br> and see the show tonight.<br> It's all right,<br> but it's not bouncing along<br> the way it used to.<br> Who's letting down?<br> All of us except Brita,<br> of course.<br> Of course.<br> She's always wonderful.<br> There's something<br> interests me, Tony,<br> because it's none<br> of my business.<br> You and Brita,<br> you've been divorced now,<br> how long is it, 2 years?<br> And 4 months.<br> All right.<br> And you're both<br> still in love, aren't you?<br> So?<br> Why don't we marry again?<br> Yeah.<br> We love each other<br> too much for that.<br> I see.<br> See you later, friends.<br> Now, what about<br> The Othello thing?<br> Uh, look,<br> don't count on me<br> too much for this, Max.<br> I've got a feeling it<br> isn't the sort of thing<br> I ought to do,<br> great or no.<br> Think it over.<br> We'll talk about it later.<br> All right.<br> We ought to think<br> about it, too.<br> Why?<br> A sensation.<br> For someone<br> who's been exposed to it<br> as much as you have,<br> it's a wonder you don't<br> know more about acting.<br> What is there to know?<br> It's a talent.<br> Some got it, some ain't.<br> No, no.<br> When you do it<br> like Tony does,<br> it's much more.<br> The way he has<br> of becoming someone else<br> every night,<br> for just a few hours,<br> so completely...<br> No, don't tell me<br> that his whole system<br> isn't affected by it.<br> I swear I never<br> saw such a thing.<br> Here I bring up<br> a great proposition,<br> and everybody's as gloomy<br> as closing in New Haven.<br> I don't like trouble.<br> We'll see.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> We'll see.<br> Hello, Bill.<br> Max.<br> Victor here?<br> Yeah.<br> Right over there.<br> I just got the proofs<br> of Brita's new pictures<br> for the sunday edition.<br> Fine. Wait till you hear<br> the next publicity campaign<br> you're gonna do...<br> knock you on your ear.<br> Something new?<br> New, old.<br> Tell you tomorrow.<br> Excuse me, mr. Lasler.<br> I'm going to marry<br> the most wonderful man<br> in the world: Martin.<br> My valet?<br> Coffee, miss?<br> Thank you, Martin.<br> Just when did all this<br> happen, Martin?<br> Miss Cole did me the honor<br> of accepting my<br> proposal of marriage<br> on may 14th last,<br> sir.<br> On may 15th,<br> a fortnight ago...<br> Thank you.<br> Not at all, sir.<br> I gave you my 2-weeks notice<br> and informed you that I<br> was going to be married.<br> You didn't say it was to<br> my girl.<br> It didn't seem proper<br> to do so, sir.<br> Proper!<br> What cheek.<br> But what charm.<br> It's no surprise<br> to me. After all,<br> he's a gentleman's<br> gentleman.<br> Beginning now,<br> he's a lady's<br> gentleman.<br> I'm not going to cry.<br> Ah, ducky.<br> Honey.<br> Martin!<br> But my dear sir,<br> my time was up when<br> the clock struck.<br> I hope I've given<br> complete satisfaction.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> Mother!<br> Was I a bit over tonight?<br> Oh, Max, I've been<br> looking for you.<br> Hello,<br> mr. Lasler.<br> Drop over the office.<br> Hello, Victor, dear.<br> That's you, sweetheart!<br> Oh, Tony!<br> There's something<br> I want to talk to you about.<br> Yes. Oh, a little later.<br> Max, are you<br> going to the party?<br> No. I'll be...<br> One more.<br> Oh, leave 'em hungry,<br> is what I say.<br> What do you think?<br> How did it go?<br> Oh, it impressed me.<br> There were a couple spots<br> I wanted to talk to you about.<br> Oh, look who's here?<br> Shakespeare's agent, eh?<br> Yes?<br> Hello,<br> Brita.<br> Bill, come on in.<br> Is it all right?<br> If you don't stay too long.<br> Hi, Gladys.<br> Your new pictures.<br> Oh, good.<br> Oh, I better look them over<br> in the morning.<br> Tony and I are going?<br> I know.<br> I'm going, too.<br> Can I hitch a ride with you?<br> Of course.<br> Hey, what's all this<br> about a new play,<br> something for you and Tony?<br> Play?<br> Sounded pretty definite,<br> the way Max talked about it.<br> I...<br> I thought you knew.<br> No, I didn't.<br> Well, I hope<br> it's a comedy,<br> if they want me in it.<br> Why? You've just<br> had a year of one.<br> You know Tony.<br> When he's doing something<br> gay like this,<br> it's wonderful<br> to be with him,<br> but when he gets going on one<br> of those deep numbers...<br> It sounds as if you're<br> trying to talk yourself<br> out of marrying him again?<br> Think so?<br> Listen, we were engaged<br> doing Oscar Wilde,<br> broke it off doing O'Neill.<br> We married doing<br> Kaufman and Hart,<br> and divorced doing Chekhov.<br> Would you advise me to<br> go through all that again?<br> Would you take my advice?<br> Mr. Friend, would you<br> take my advice<br> and clear out?<br> She's got to get dressed.<br> Sure. Sorry.<br> I'll be waiting.<br> All right.<br> It seems to me like<br> I spend half my life<br> trying to keep people<br> from not going crazy.<br> And not succeeding.<br> Brita: Ready, dear?<br> Oh, come on in,<br> darling.<br> Well, I guess<br> not many women would<br> climb all the way<br> up here to see you.<br> You think not, eh?<br> Ha ha.<br> You'd be surprised.<br> Oh, look.<br> Oh, lovely.<br> Beautiful.<br> Honest, it's like<br> they were married.<br> It's like<br> they were engaged,<br> which is better<br> than married.<br> Tony, look that over<br> tonight, will you?<br> Try. I've got to go up<br> to Gilbert's for a while.<br> And talk to Brita about it.<br> Aw, sure.<br> See you.<br> Good night.<br> Good-bye.<br> Bye.<br> Talk to Brita about what?<br> Othello.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Is that on again?<br> Well, just thinking.<br> What about a holiday, Tony?<br> I'll take one before I do this,<br> if I do it at all.<br> Oh, sure,<br> I know those holidays.<br> I've shared them with you.<br> You keep remembering<br> the rehearsal date,<br> rushing up to meet you.<br> You think about your part.<br> You worry.<br> You wake up<br> and pace the floor all night,<br> and you go silent for<br> long stretches all day.<br> And those<br> disappearances of yours.<br> It's a living nightmare,<br> not a holiday.<br> That's right,<br> that's right.<br> But then what?<br> It's not worth it, Tony.<br> This past year,<br> it's been fun, you know?<br> There have been times<br> when I almost thought<br> we'd make it together<br> again if we tried.<br> Yeah?<br> I know if we ever got mixed up<br> in an Othello kind of thing<br> it would be the end.<br> Oh, but why, baby?<br> You know why?<br> Because you won't learn<br> to leave it at midnight.<br> I used to and never got past<br> playing bits in stock,<br> and you're the one<br> that did that to me.<br> Let's not forget that.<br> Did what?<br> Inspired me,<br> or whatever you call it.<br> Oh, we'll talk about it<br> some other time.<br> You're tired now.<br> Come along.<br> Let's go to the party<br> and have a good, gay time,<br> tell yokes to all<br> the private peoples.<br> Yokes.<br> Jokes.
