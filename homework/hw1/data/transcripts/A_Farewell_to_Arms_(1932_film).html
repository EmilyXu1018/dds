                        Driver.<br> - Driver, stop!<br> - Why do you want to stop?<br> The man up there. He is bleeding<br> to death.<br> We can't stop. Not here.<br> The brakes won't hold.<br> Orderly, Orderly!<br> and just as guility as a soldier would be.....<br> ...who deserted his post under fire.<br> Now in making an example of you, I....<br> I beg your pardon sir. I have some<br> wounded outside. I am looking for the...<br> Oh yes, yes, yes. You want the<br> Italien unit. We are the English unit you see.<br> - Yes number 20 7.<br> - They're in the other wing. Moved in today.<br> Yes out that way, straight ahead.<br> Thank-you Major.<br> What's the girl's friend been doing?<br> Typical male conceit.<br> I think they're going to send her<br> back home.<br> It's a dirty shame. She'll be<br> disgraced.<br> Shh, here they come.<br> Well, is it necessary for us all to be<br> here at one time? Get back to your post.<br> You be packed and ready to leave<br> in one hour.'<br> Molly.<br> Can I help pack.<br> I guess so....if you want to.<br> Why of course I want to.<br> - Good girls.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> I say, she's the only human being in<br> the whole lot of us.<br> I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears to<br> sympathize with one....<br> ....that has disgraced the uniform<br> that we all wear.<br> - Davie!<br> - Renaulte!<br> Get away. You're fi lthy.<br> You anglosaxens. You're not to<br> clean yourself.<br> Did you bring me some good<br> kisses, baby? Did you have trouble finding us?<br> No.<br> How do you feel? Is there going to<br> be an offensive?<br> Were you under fire? Madonna, but<br> I worried about you!<br> Yes, I can see how much you've<br> been worrying.<br> I had 7 operations today baby and<br> one of them was beautiful.<br> I took the heart out.<br> It lay in my hand, and beat like this.<br> You should have seen it. It was lovely.<br> Soon Renaulte will be the best<br> surgeon in all the court.<br> Then in all the army.....<br> and some day, in all of ltaly.<br> - Why not in all the world?<br> - Why not?<br> You will like it here baby.<br> What sort of a town is this?<br> Any girls?<br> Many beautiful English nurses.<br> The most beautiful is Miss Barkley<br> I am in love with her.<br> Does she know it?<br> Not yet.<br> Have you any money?<br> - Yes.<br> - Lend me 50 lire.<br> What for?<br> I want to make on Miss Barkley the<br> impression of a man of sufficient wealth.<br> - All right.<br> - Thank-you.<br> You are my great and good friend<br> and financial protector.<br> And you're an ass.<br> Now we will eat and drink and I will<br> take you to meet Miss Barkley.<br> But, you must make for me a good<br> impression upon her.<br> - Now listen......<br> - But you must.<br> And you can have a nurse too.<br> There is another one named Miss<br> Fergerson. She is very, very nice.<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> First we will eat and drink and then<br> we'll go and see the girls, yes?<br> Yes.<br> You see, she doesn't know.<br> Neither do I.<br> Oh, you've had too much wine.<br> It's filthy wine....it takes the enamel off your<br> teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth.<br> - Where was I?<br> - Architecture.<br> Oh yes. Look.....<br> .....I'll explain.<br> This my dear, is called an arch....<br> The arch my dear, is perhaps the<br> oldest of architecturial devices.<br> Arch. Architecture.<br> The very word will tell you how<br> inextricably the two are one.<br> In a word my dear.....<br> Architecture.....<br> ...is the most ancient of the arts.<br> You'd better put your shoe on, or<br> you'll get cold feet.<br> If you please, I'd like to go now.<br> The air raid seems to be over.<br> Catherine.<br> Catherine.<br> - Catherine.<br> - Here I am Fergie. I'm coming.<br> Oh, I was so worried.<br> Did you think I'd been blown away?<br> I didn't know what to think. Nobody<br> saw where you went.<br> Who's that man.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Some lunatic.<br> Come on.<br> What if we take the mountains to<br> the north. Behind them are more<br> mountains....<br> and behind those more yet. And we<br> take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting.<br> One side of course will stop.<br> - It will go on forever.<br> - Like him.<br> No, no, no. It is not true.<br> But you don't want us to attack?<br> If we must have war, I suppose we<br> must attack.<br> But, so many die that way.<br> But what is death to a Christian.<br> Don't encourage him Fergie.<br> Frederico.<br> - You are back safe.<br> - Hello Father.<br> - I am so glad.<br> - He prays and prays for you Frederico.<br> Every time you go out the door, he<br> does the same.<br> Oh, I pray for you all.<br> You are late baby. How is it up<br> there? Quiet?<br> You nearly missed the party.<br> But it is very dull.<br> But Miss Barkley is her and her<br> friend Miss Fergerson.<br> The one you will like. Come.<br> Miss Barkley, permit me to present<br> to you...<br> ... my friend and war brother Lt. Henry.<br> He has just returned back from the front.<br> How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> And this is Miss Fergerson.<br> -How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Now he begins again, that fellow.<br> Quick let us go into the garden.<br> Now, you stay here.<br> I will fi nd something for us to drink.<br> Grappa? Vermouth?<br> - Which do you like?<br> - All of them.<br> Then you shall have all of them.<br> -Nice out here.<br> - Isn't it?<br> We seem fated to bump into each<br> other in the dark.<br> I'm sorry about that. I mistook you<br> for someone else.<br> So I gathered.<br> - I had been drinking.<br> - So I'd gathered that too.<br> - Mad?<br> - No.<br> - You're an American, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> Then what are you doing in the<br> Italien army?<br> It's not really the army, it's only the<br> ambulance.<br> It's very odd. Why did you do it?<br> I don't know. Why did you?<br> Oh, I joined up in England.<br> The fact is the boy I was engaged<br> to had gone across.<br> - Where is Miss Fergerson.<br> - Why don't you go and see?<br> Yes, do bring her out Captain<br> Renaulte.<br> Have some?<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks.<br> Because I'm here with you.<br> Women perfer him as a rule.<br> Shall we take a walk?<br> Yes, let's.<br> - Where is he now?<br> - Who?<br> The boy you were engaged to.<br> He's dead.<br> He was killed by a SAM.<br> Were you engaged long?<br> Eight years. We grew up together.<br> Why didn't you marry?<br> I didn't know what the war was like<br> then<br> If I had to do over again, I'd marry him.<br> When I joined up, I had this silly<br> idea that he may......<br> .....come to the hospital where I was.<br> With a saber cut I suppose and a<br> bandage around his head.<br> Shot through the shoulder.<br> Something picturesque.<br> This is a picturesque front. Not<br> France.<br> He didn't have a saber cut.<br> They blew him to bits.<br> What are you thinking about now?<br> About whiskey.<br> What about whiskey?<br> About how nice it is.<br> You're nice too.<br> You're nice too.<br> - Why not?<br> - No please.<br> - Yes.<br> - No please!<br> I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?<br> It's all right.<br> I'm dreadly sorry. Really.<br> I just couldn't bear...<br> ...the nurses' evening off.<br> It's quite all right. I don't mind at all.<br> Poor man.<br> You see......I've been leading a<br> funny sort of life.<br> Besides, you're so very beautiful.<br> You don't have to talk a lot of<br> nonesense, I said I'm sorry.<br> We could get along.<br> We could get along.<br> You're sweet.<br> - You're sweet.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> I would be very glad to have you<br> kiss me now, if you don't mind.<br> Did you have a nice time baby?<br> You made progress with her, eh?<br> We're friends. If that's what you<br> mean?<br> I mean...was she nice to you.....<br> Shut up!<br> I am a man of extreme delicacy, but<br> was she.....<br> Renaulte! Will you please shut up.<br> If you want to be a friend of mine,<br> then shut up.<br> I am your best friend and your war<br> brother.<br> Then shut up.<br> Miss Barkley perfers you to me.<br> That is very clear.<br> But Miss Fergerson is very nice too.<br> Do you like her?<br> No!<br> Good-bye<br> Good luck.<br> - Turn back.<br> - Back?<br> Yes, back!<br> - I want to see Miss Barkley.<br> - She's on duty.<br> Wait, don't go in there.<br> Why we come back here for?<br> Lt. knows what he's doing. Please.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Are't we going to get started here?<br> We have plenty of time.<br> I thought you started. What are you<br> doing here?<br> We come back Senor Capitano.<br> The Lt. Forgot something.<br> Hi....you're all right aren't you?<br> Yes, I'm all right.<br> I came to..<br> I thought.....<br> ...you see.<br> I'm going to be away for a while..<br> ...and I didn't want you to think that<br> I'd just gone away.<br> No, I...<br> What I mean is.....<br> ....I'd hate to have you feel that...<br> it wasn't important to me..<br> ..about us.<br> I don't exactly know how to say it.<br> You said it very nicely dear, thank-you.<br> No, no I didn't.<br> - You mustn't feel.<br> - Will you be gone long?<br> No.<br> Only a few days. There's going to<br> be a show up above......<br> A show? You'll be careful won't you?<br> I won't get hit.<br> Hold this.<br> Here....<br> It's a St. Anthony.<br> They sayd St. Anthony is very<br> useful to guard you from harm.<br> I'll take good care of him.<br> But I wish I could kiss you.<br> He is my friend and a good soldier<br> I would hate to see him lose his<br> head over a woman.<br> Aren't you exaggerating a bit.<br> I think not.<br> Couldn't we send her back to the<br> base, Major?<br> Oh, if you could send her away it<br> would simplify everything<br> Could perhaps send her to Milan.<br> Excellent my dear Major.<br> Magnificient. No wonder the<br> English are first in dipolmacy.<br> What did you say her name was?<br> We won't get anything else to eat,<br> once the attacks start.<br> This is all they given me.<br> Starting to eat the rations?<br> No, we'll all eat together. Come on<br> and sit down.<br> Thank-you.<br> Here, you can use this.<br> Here, take some cheese.<br> Wash it down with wine.<br> Who caused the attack?<br> No progress.<br> Nobody would attack, if the war<br> would be over.<br> - No, 305...<br> - It sounded like a sconer to me.<br> - Sconer, that's what I say.<br> Lt.! Are you hurt?<br> My leg.<br> Both of my legs.<br> Lacerations of the scalp and<br> possible fracture of the skull.<br> Multiply superficial wounds of the<br> left and right thighs..<br> ......left and right knee and right<br> foot.....<br> In current line of duty. Next patient<br> please.<br> Lift him up on the table. Carefully.<br> How do you feel, baby?<br> Renaulte. What are you doing<br> here?<br> Boneldo telephoned me.<br> The Major gave me permission to come.<br> No one shall hurt you baby. I won't<br> let them.<br> No butcher is going to touch my war<br> brother.<br> Only Renaulte can take you and<br> never hurt you.<br> You must forgive baby, for talking<br> so much...<br> ...but I am, I am very moved to see<br> you bodily wounded.<br> I will see that you are decorated for<br> bravery.<br> Perhaps we can you you the<br> medillion, but surely the bronze<br> one. Did you carry anyone on your back?<br> I didn't carry anybody. I couldn't<br> move.<br> Surely there was something very<br> hero in what you did.<br> I was blown up eating cheese.<br> Don't worry baby. I will fi x you so<br> that you are as good as new.<br> You will see that everyday, I learn to<br> do things smoother, quicker.<br> Soon, very soon, you will be<br> walking again.<br> I brought a persent for you.<br> You will fi nd it under your blanket,<br> next to your heart.<br> It is a bottle of brandy baby. Very<br> good brandy.<br> The infantry captured it from the<br> Austrians.<br> I have another surprise for you.<br> Take a deep breathe.<br> Where do you think you will go from<br> here?<br> To the Italien hospital where they<br> have the male nurses with the beards?<br> No!<br> I will arrange everything with my<br> friend, the British Major.<br> You will go to Milan. To the<br> beautiful Miss Barkley.<br> That makes you happy?<br> Poor Renaulte. So alone with the<br> war...<br> No one to make fun of. No one to<br> lend him money.<br> While you are in Milan with the<br> beautiful Miss Barkley.<br> Making love in Milan to the chase<br> Miss Barkley.<br> Look out for the step.<br> Why do you stop?<br> I am superintendent. May I have<br> your medical papers please.<br> They're in my coat. In the<br> buttoned-down pocket.<br> Take him up those stairs, down the<br> corridor.<br> His room is the one at the end.<br> You show him Julio.<br> Who are you?<br> I am the porter. Come follow me.<br> We must lift you up on the bed.<br> - All right. But keep my legs straight.<br> - Yes, yes sir.<br> Can I get you anything?<br> - Get me some brandy.<br> - It is not allowed.<br> Wasn't I wounded, fi ghting for the<br> glory of ltaly?<br> - You'll fi nd some money in my pocket.<br> - As you wish.<br> - So it's you!<br> - Fergerson.<br> - Is Catherine here?<br> - As if you didn't know.<br> I believe that's why you got<br> wounded.<br> - Where is she?<br> -You ought to be still.<br> Here's your chart. I must take your<br> temperature.<br> Does she know I'm here?<br> Under the arm please.<br> - Hello darling.<br> - Catherine.<br> You're lovely.<br> - Are you badly hurt?<br> - Are you badly hurt?<br> - Oh my poor darling. It's your leg isn't it?<br> - You're the lovliest thing I ever saw.<br> I have to go now darlilng, I can't stay.<br> - Will you come back?<br> - Later, but we have to be awfully careful.<br> - You've got to come back.<br> - I will, when I can.<br> - Tonight?<br> - Tonight?<br> Somebody's coming.<br> Tonight.<br> I'll take that thermometer now.<br> Good gracious.<br> Fetch the doctor.<br> It's a mircle you're not delerious<br> with such a fever.<br> - I haven't got any fever.<br> - Stay quiet.<br> It's not what you think.<br> I've brought you a few little things.<br> And this is mosquito netting and<br> this is a bottle of vermouth.<br> You like vermouth?<br> - And these are English papers.<br> - And these are English papers.<br> It was very good of you to come.<br> I mustn't stay long. They warned<br> me not to tire you.<br> You seem very tired yourself.<br> I am tired. I have no right to be.<br> You have the war to lead.<br> No, I hate the war.<br> - I don't enjoy it.<br> - But you do not mind it.<br> You do not see it. Oh, you must<br> forgive me. I know that you are wounded.<br> That was an accident.<br> Still even wounded, you do not see it.<br> I can tell. I do not see it myself, but<br> I feel it a little.<br> Come in Captain.<br> Don't go yet Father. It's still early.<br> Are you sure. With the operation in<br> the morning, he should rest.<br> He's strong.<br> He has a lovely temperature. It is<br> always normal.<br> I'm very proud of his temperature.<br> Maybe all of our children will have<br> fine temperatures too.<br> Our children will probably have<br> beastly temperatures.<br> Don't mind us Father. We're in love.<br> I know....<br> I can see it in your faces.<br> I can see it in your faces.<br> I can see it in your faces.<br> This too is the war. Without the<br> war, you will not marry in Gods grace.<br> Is it not so?<br> And you?<br> I hadn't thought about it like that.<br> But...<br> I hadn't thought about it like that.<br> But...<br> Father, are you???<br> Is that the marriage service?<br> Poor chap.<br> It's such a crazy marriage.<br> At least I'm in white.<br> No orange blossoms.<br> I can smell them.<br> No organ music.<br> I can hear it plainly.<br> It has made me happy to do this.<br> For now, from my heart, can I say I<br> bless you in His name.<br> Thank-you Father.<br> Good-bye and be happy, both of you.<br> Thank-you Father.<br> - Give my regards to the mass.<br> - I will.<br> And get well soon.

I threw six benches myself.<br> That's not funny.<br> Oh now he is offended.<br> He'll get over it. That's his sore<br> spot. We always tease him.<br> - You don't care whom you hurt.<br> - Now don't you get mad too.<br> Catherine and I were thinking of<br> asking you to our wedding.<br> Weren't we Catherine?<br> - You'll never get married.<br> - We will!<br> We will!<br> - Oh, we never fight.<br> - You've time yet.<br> We won't fi ght ever.<br> You'll die then.<br> Fight or die. That's what people do.<br> - They don't marry.<br> - Fergie...<br> I'm not crying.<br> Maybe you'll be all right, you two.<br> But Fergie.....<br> What is the matter with it?<br> She doesn't like me, that's all.<br> Oh no. She just likes me more.<br> Oh no. She just likes me more.<br> Oh no. She just likes me more.<br> You wait and see......<br> Darling.....how many other girls<br> have you ever loved?<br> None.<br> How many, really?<br> None.<br> How many have you...<br> ... loved?<br> - None.<br> - None.<br> Of course.<br> Of course.<br> Were they pretty?<br> I've never been with anyone.<br> That's right my darling.<br> What were they like?<br> I don't know anything about it.<br> You're just mine. That's true.<br> You've never belonged to anyone else.<br> I don't care if you have though. I'm<br> not afraid of them.<br> Only don't tell me about them.<br> You never told them you loved them<br> did you?<br> - No.<br> - I knew you wouldn't.<br> -Oh darling, I do love yo<br> - Then, kiss me.<br> - Right here on the street?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll go in fi rst.<br> What is this? If I may ask.<br> What was in it.<br> That's beer. That's the best kind. It comes<br> in those bear shaped bottles from Russia.<br> And these.<br> That's brandy, wine and whiskey.<br> And I have been pitying you for<br> being wounded.<br> Pity is something that is wasted on you.<br> Thank you.<br> If you're so anxious not to go back<br> to the front......<br> .....I should think you'd try<br> something more intelligent.<br> Not self-inflicted alcoholism.<br> - What?<br> - I said alcoholism.<br> And I also say, that I'll see you<br> convalesce leave is cancelled.<br> You'll go back to the front tomorrow night.<br> Have I time for a drink before the<br> train leaves?<br> - For the front?<br> - Yes.<br> In about 20 minutes senor<br> Capitano.<br> You're a fine simple girl.<br> I am a simple girl. Nobody but<br> you ever realized it.<br> At first, I thought you were a crazy<br> girl.<br> I was a little crazy at first.<br> Is that your train?<br> Maybe.....<br> It makes a return. But it stays in the<br> station here until it is time to leave.<br> There's really lots of time.<br> But at my back, I always hear, times<br> wicked chariot hurrying near"....<br> I know that poem. It's by Marvel.<br> Listen.<br> It's only the rain.<br> I hate the rain.<br> I like it.<br> I'm afraid of the rain.<br> Afraid, why?<br> I.....<br> Oh, perhaps it's silly.<br> What? Tell me.<br> - No. Don't make me.<br> - No. Don't make me.<br> All right.,<br> I'm afraid of the rain, because<br> sometimes I see me dead in it.<br> No!<br> Sometimes I see you dead in it.<br> -Well that's more likely.<br> -Oh no darling, don't say that.<br> That is your train.<br> Times winged chariot".<br> Times winged chariot".<br> No, please, I don't want you. Not<br> at the station.<br> All right darling.<br> How often will you write?<br> As often as I can. Do they read<br> your letters?<br> They can't read English enough to<br> hurt any.<br> Well I'll make them very confusing.<br> Not too confusing.<br> Oh, I should have got you a going-<br> away gift.<br> A whistle to make you feel better in<br> the dark.<br> Or a sword. I'm sure we could get<br> a used sword very cheap.<br> Swords aren't very useful at the<br> front.<br> Oh I see, they get in the way of<br> your legs when you are running.<br> They might be useful at mess<br> though.<br> I'm afraid I have to start darling.<br> I hate to leave our fine house.<br> So do I.<br> We never stay settled very long in a<br> home, do we?<br> We will.<br> I'll have a fine home for you when<br> you come back.<br> Say I'll come back to Catherine.<br> I'll come back to Catherine.<br> I'll always come back.<br> Maybe this time, you'll be hurt just a<br> little in the foot.<br> Or the lobe of the ear.<br> Oh no. I want your ears just the<br> way they are.<br> Your feet have been hurt already.<br> I want a ticket to Switzerland<br> please.<br> - Where Senora, to what town?<br> - The nearest one to Italy.<br> - That would be Brissago.<br> - Then give me a ticket to Brissago.<br> All right.<br> Oh Fergie, I was afraid you wouldn't<br> come.<br> Would you mind telling me what this<br> is all about?<br> - I'm going away.<br> - So I gathered by this, but you.....<br> .....didn't tell him?<br> What would be the good. It would only<br> worry him and he would have to go anyway.<br> Aren't you going to tell him.<br> Well, not yet.<br> I may write him from Switzerland.<br> -You're a fool.<br> - Here Senora.<br> - On track three.<br> - Thank-you.<br> What's the hurry?<br> Why tonight?<br> I couldn't go back to that hospital.<br> I couldn't stand it. Not with him<br> gone.<br> - But you'll be all alone in Switzerland.....<br> - Now don't worry Fergie, I'll be all right.<br> You're not afraid of anything are you?<br> Only of going back to that hospital.<br> Don't scold me Fergie.<br> I'll carry it.<br> I've always told you I was a crazy girl.....<br> I couldn't bear Milan while you were away.<br> So, I've chucked the war and come<br> to live in this little Swiss town....<br> ......as close as possible to the<br> Italien border.....<br> and you.<br> And darling, it's an adorable place<br> and we'll be very happy here.<br> I've taken a suite....<br> ....in the best hotel.<br> And I am fairly wallowing in luxury.<br> The bed is fit for an empress.<br> There is a maroon velvet carpet,<br> ankle deep.......<br> ....and a bathroom, or darling the<br> bathroom.<br> It's a black marble, with silver<br> fittings.<br> I've just dined in state, at my sitting-<br> room window.<br> From which there is a devine view<br> of the lake, shimmering in moonlight.<br> I'm an awful liar darling.....<br> It's not really a nice place at all. It's<br> mean, cheap and horrible.<br> But it doesn't matter where I live....<br> ....because I don't really live at all,<br> when I'm not with you.<br> Darling....<br> What I really want to tell you is...<br> ......I lay awake in the dark and cry<br> because you are not here.<br> I'm lonely and frightened.<br> And I love you.<br> -Hurry baby.<br> - Why?<br> - It's time to go.<br> - Go where?<br> But I told you before to the Villa<br> Rosa. New girls. Everybody is going.<br> No, not me.<br> But you must. It will be a fi ne party<br> and besides I said that you would go.<br> I can't. I've got to write a letter.<br> To that little......everyday, more<br> letters. You might as well be married.<br> That's my business.<br> Oh baby. How are you ever going<br> to come back to me?<br> Serious, like a shopkeeper with a<br> liver. Where is my war brother, who<br> used to get drunk with me....<br> ......and go to the Villa Rosa every night?<br> Leave me alone, will you?<br> Why? Isn't she just a girl?<br> Keep her out of this.<br> Secrets. Believe me baby.....<br> ...secrets subjects are not good for<br> soldiers.<br> Why don't you be like me? All fire<br> and smoke.<br> And nothing inside.<br> - Come on baby.<br> - You're drunk, stop it.<br> Of course I am drunk. You come<br> with me and you will be drunk too.<br> Come on baby.<br> Oh, I am sorry. Now you must<br> come. There is no more ink.<br> Get your hands off of me and get out!<br> Poor baby....<br> Poor baby....<br> ...and I will put you in, a good Italien<br> liver and make you a man again.<br> Ciao baby<br> You're going out Senor Capitano?<br> You're going out Senor Capitano?<br> The mail just came, Senor<br> Capitano.<br> You sensor it.<br> Senor Capitano.....the officers mail too.<br> - Aren't you going to open them<br> Senor Capitano? - No!<br> I'm in a hurry.<br> - Send this one back.<br> - Yes, Senor Capitano.<br> I do not like to see himself lose his<br> head over a woman.<br> Yes Senor Capitano.<br> And today my letters came back.<br> Everyone that I'd ever written to her.<br> Came back?<br> Just marked return to sender.<br> Person unknown.<br> Well, that's very strange.<br> -32 letters. She never got one.<br> - Well, that's why she never wrote you.<br> No, she'd have written me anyway.<br> Something's happened to her.<br> - Have you tried......<br> - I can't get any information at all.<br> - I've got to go and fi nd her, myself.<br> - Now, can you?<br> I'm going to Milan.<br> I'll fi nd her.<br> I'm going to Milan.
