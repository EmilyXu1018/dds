Agent who took<br> Dawson and Downey's statements...<br> maintains theywere trying<br> to prevent Santiago...<br> from naming Dawson<br> in a fenceline shooting incident.<br> They're scheduled to have a hearing<br> down in Cuba this afternoon at 1 600.<br> - What's the problem?<br> - Dawson and Downey...<br> are both recruiting poster Marines,<br> and Santiago was known to be a screwup.<br> I was thinking it sounded an awful lot<br> like a Code Red.<br> Christ.<br> Sir, I'd like to have them moved<br> up to Washington and assigned counsel--<br> someone who can really<br> look into this--<br> someone who possesses<br> not only the legal skill...<br> but a familiarity<br> with the innerworkings ofthe military.<br> In short, Captain,<br> I'd like to suggest that...<br> I be the one who that--<br> that it be me who is assigned<br> to represent them...<br> myself.<br> Commander Galloway, why don'tyou<br> getyourselfa cup ofcoffee?<br> Thankyou, sir. I'm fine.<br> I'd likeyou to leave the room so<br> we can talk aboutyou behind your back.<br> Certainly, sir.<br> I thought this Code Red shit<br> wasn't going on anymore.<br> With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows<br> what the hell goes on down there?<br> We better find out<br> before the rest ofthe world does.<br> Damn thing could get messy.<br> All right,<br> what about this Commander Galloway?<br> She's been working a desk<br> in Internal Affairs...<br> for a little over a year now.<br> - Before that?<br> - Disposed ofthree cases in twoyears.<br> Three cases in twoyears?<br> Who's she handling, the Rosenbergs?<br> - She's not cut out for litigation.<br> - She's a hell ofan investigator.<br> In Internal Affairs she can crawl up<br> a lawyer's ass with the best ofthem.<br> - But when it comes to trial work--<br> - I know. All passion, no street smarts.<br> Bring her back in.<br> Commander, we're gonna have the<br> defendants moved up here in the morning.<br> - Thankyou, sir.<br> - Division will assign them counsel.<br> -But not me.<br> -From what I get from your colleagues...<br> you're much too valuable in your<br> present assignment to be wasted...<br> in what I'm sure will boil down<br> to a five-minute plea bargain...<br> and a week's worth ofpaperwork.<br> Sir, I think there might be<br> more involved than that.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> I promiseyou Division will assign<br> the right man for thejob.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> Let's get two.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.<br> Youjust look the ball<br> intoyour glove.<br> Shooting two.<br> - Sorry.<br> - You gotta trust me, Sherby.<br> Keepyour eyes open, your chances of<br> catching it increase by a factor often.<br> - Kaffee.<br> - Let's try it again.<br> Dave, you seem distraught.<br> We were supposed to meet 1 5 minutes ago<br> about the McDermott case.<br> You're stalling on this thing.<br> Now we either do it now...<br> or, no kidding, Kaffee, I'm gonna<br> hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!<br> Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy<br> still hang people from yardarms?<br> I don't think so.<br> Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy<br> hangs people from yardarms anymore.<br> I'm gonna charge him with possession<br> and being under the influence on duty.<br> You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days<br> in the brig with loss ofrank and pay.<br> It was oregano, Dave.<br> It was $1 0 worth oforegano.<br> Yeah, well, your client thought<br> it was marijuana.<br> My client's a moron.<br> That's not against the law.<br> Kaffee, I got people to answer to<br> just likeyou do. I'm gonna charge him.<br> With what,<br> possession ofa condiment?<br> - Kaffee.<br> - I tried to helpyou out ofthis...<br> but ifyou ask forjail time,<br> I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.<br> - You won't get it.<br> - I will get it.<br> And ifthe M.T.D. is denied,<br> I'll file a motion...<br> seeking to obtain<br> an evidentiary ruling in advance.<br> And after that, I'm gonna file<br> against pretrial confinement.<br> And you're gonna spend the next three<br> months going blind on paperwork...<br> because a signalman second-class bought<br> and smoked a dime bag oforegano.<br> Let's go!

William Santiago...<br> threatens to rat on Dawson<br> to Naval Investigative Service.<br> Dawson and another member<br> ofhis squad...<br> P.F.C.

He wanted<br> to be transferred offthe base.<br> No one was listening.<br> Areyou with me?<br> Yeah.<br> Finally, he wrote<br> to the Naval Investigative Service...<br> where he offered information about<br> Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting...<br> in exchange for a transfer.<br> Right. Is that all?<br> Lieutenant,<br> this letter makes it look like...<br> your client had a motive<br> to kill Santiago.<br> Gotyou.<br> And Santiago is who?<br> The victim.<br> Write that down.<br> Am I correct to assume these letters...<br> don't paint a flattering picture<br> of Marine Corps life at Guantanamo Bay?<br> - Yes, among--<br> - Am I further right in assuming...<br> investigation ofthis incident might<br> embarrass the Security Council guy?<br> - ColonelJessup.<br> - Twelveyears.<br> Sorry?<br> I'll get them to drop the conspiracy<br> and conduct unbecoming.<br> Twelveyears.<br> You haven't talked to a witness<br> or looked at a piece ofpaper.<br> Pretty impressive, huh?<br> You're gonna have<br> to go deeper than that.<br> Doyou have some sort ofjurisdiction<br> here that I should know about?<br> Myjob is to make sure<br> thatyou doyourjob.<br> I'm special counsel<br> for Internal Affairs...<br> so myjurisdiction's pretty much<br> in your face.<br> Read the letters. I'll expect<br> your report when you return from Cuba.<br> - Sure.<br> - You're dismissed.<br> I always forget that part.<br> He's a little preoccupied.<br> Team's playing Bethesda Medical<br> next week.<br> Tell your friend<br> not to get cute down there.<br> The Marines in Guantanamo<br> are fanatical.<br> About what?<br> About being Marines.<br> Dearsir...<br> mynameis P.F.

Ijustneed<br> tobe transferredoutofR.S. C.<br> Sincerely,<br> P.F. C. William T. Santiago...<br> U.S. Marine Corps.<br> P.S. In exchange formy transfer<br> offthebase...<br> I'm willing toprovideyou<br> with informationabout--<br> ''The illegal fenceline shooting<br> that occurred the night ofAugust 2.''<br> Who the fuck<br> is P.F.C. William T. Santiago?<br> Private Santiago is a member<br> ofSecond Platoon Bravo, sir.<br> Yeah. Well, apparently he's not<br> very happy down here in Shangri-la...<br> because he's written letters<br> to everybody but Santa Claus...<br> asking for a transfer.<br> And now he's telling tales<br> about a fenceline shooting.<br> Matthew?<br> I'm appalled, sir.<br> You're appalled.<br> This kid broke the chain ofcommand<br> and ratted on a member ofhis unit...<br> to say nothing ofthe fact<br> that he is a U.S. Marine...<br> and it would appear he can't run<br> from here to there...<br> without collapsing<br> from heat exhaustion.<br> What the fuck is going on<br> in Bravo Company, Matthew?<br> Colonel, I think it would be better<br> to hold this discussion in private.<br> That won't be necessary, Colonel.<br> I can handle the situation, sir.<br> The same wayyou handled Curtis Bell?<br> Don't interrupt me, Lieutenant!<br> - I'm still your superior officer.<br> - And I'm yours, Matthew.<br> I wanna know<br> what we're going to do about this.<br> I think Santiago should be transferred<br> offthe base immediately.<br> He's that bad, huh?<br> Not only that. But word<br> ofthis letter is bound to get out.<br> He's gonna get his ass whipped.<br> Hmm. Transfer Santiago.<br> Yes. I'm sureyou're right.<br> I'm sure that's the thing to do.<br> Wait. I've got a better idea.<br> Let's transfer the whole squad<br> offthe base.<br> Let's-- On second thought, Windward--<br> Let's transfer the whole<br> Windward Division offthe base.<br> John, go on out there<br> and get those boys down offthe fence.<br> They're packing their bags. Tom.<br> - Sir.<br> - Get me the president on the phone.<br> We're surrendering<br> our position in Cuba.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Wait a minute, Tom.<br> Don't get the presidentjustyet.<br> Maybe we should<br> consider this for a second.<br> - Dismissed, Tom.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Maybe-- and I'm just<br> spit-balling here--<br> Maybe we have a responsibility<br> as officers to train Santiago.<br> Maybe we as officers<br> have a responsibility to this country...<br> to see that the men and women<br> charged with its security...<br> are trained professionals.<br> Yes, I'm certain<br> that I read that somewhere once.<br> And now I'm thinking,<br> Colonel Markinson...<br> thatyour suggestion<br> oftransferring Santiago...<br> while expeditious<br> and certainly painless...<br> might not be,<br> in a manner ofspeaking...<br> the American way.<br> Santiago stays where he is.<br> We're gonna train the lad.<br> John, you're in charge.<br> Santiago doesn't make 4-6-4-6...<br> on his next proficiency<br> and conduct report...<br> I'm going to blameyou.<br> - Then I'm going to kill you.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I think that's a mistake, Colonel.<br> Matthew, I think I will<br> have that word in private with you now.<br> John, that's all. Why don't we meet<br> at the ''O'' club and have lunch...<br> and we'll talk about the training<br> ofyoung William?<br> I'd be delighted to hear any<br> suggestions thatyou might have, sir.<br> - Dismissed.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Matthew, sit down. Please.<br> What doyou think of Kendrick?<br> My opinion ofhim has nothing to do--<br> I think he's pretty much<br> ofa weasel myself...<br> but he's an awfully good officer.<br> And in the end, we see eye-to-eye on<br> the best way to run a Marine Corps unit.<br> We're in the business<br> ofsaving lives, Matthew.<br> That is a responsibility<br> that we have to take pretty seriously.<br> And I believe that taking a Marine<br> who is not quite up to thejob...<br> and shipping him off<br> to another assignment...<br> puts lives in danger.<br> Sit down, Matthew.<br> We go back a while.<br> We went to the Academy together.<br> We were commissioned together.<br> We did our tours in Vietnam together.<br> But I've been promoted<br> up through the chain...<br> with greater speed and success<br> than you have.<br> Now, ifthat's a source oftension...<br> or embarrassment foryou...<br> I don't give a shit.<br> We're in the business ofsaving lives,<br> Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.<br> Don't ever question my orders<br> in front ofanother officer.<br> All the paperwork's in order.<br> - Step over there.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hal, is this Washington, D.C.?<br> All right. Let's move.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Got all ofthat one.<br> - Excuse me.<br> I wanted to talk toyou about<br> Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.<br> - Say again?<br> - Dawson and Downey.<br> Those names sound like<br> they should mean something to me--<br> Dawson, Downey--your clients.<br> The Cuba thing. Yes!<br> Dawson and Downey. Right.<br> I've done something wrong again,<br> haven't I?<br> I wasjust wondering<br> why two guys have been locked up...<br> since this morning while their lawyer's<br> outside hitting a ball.<br> We need the practice.<br> That wasn't funny.<br> It was a little funny.<br> Would you be very insulted<br> ifI recommended toyour supervisor...<br> that he assign different counsel?<br> - Why?<br> - I don't thinkyou're fit to handle it.<br> You don't even know me.<br> Ordinarily, it takes someone hours...<br> to discover I'm not fit<br> to handle a defense.<br> Oh, come on.<br> That was damn funny.<br> You're wrong.<br> I do knowyou.<br> Daniel Alistair Kaffee,<br> bornJune 8, 1 964...<br> at Boston Mercy Hospital.<br> Your father's Lionel Kaffee...<br> former Navyjudge advocate and<br> attorney general ofthe United States.<br> Died 1 985.<br> You went to Harvard law.<br> Then youjoined the Navy...<br> probably because that's<br> whatyour fatherwanted you to do.<br> And nowyou'rejust treading water<br> for threeyears in theJAG Corps.<br> Just laying low till<br> you can get out and get a real job.<br> Ifthat's the situation, that's fine.<br> I won't tell anyone.<br> But it's my feeling that<br> ifthis case is handled in the same...<br> fast-food, slick-ass,<br> Persian bazaar manner...<br> with which you seem<br> to handle everything else...<br> then something's gonna get missed.<br> And I wouldn't be doing myjob<br> ifI allowed Dawson and Downey...<br> to spend any more time in prison<br> than absolutely necessary...<br> because their attorney had predetermined<br> the path ofleast resistance.<br> Wow.<br> I'm sexually aroused, Commander.<br> I don't think<br> your clients murdered anyone.<br> What areyou basing this on?<br> There was no intent.<br> The doctor's report says<br> Santiago died ofasphyxiation...<br> brought on by acute lactic acidosis...<br> and that the nature ofthe acidosis<br> strongly suggests poison.<br> I don't know what any ofthat means,<br> but it sounds pretty bad.<br> Santiago died at 1 :00 a.m.<br> At 3:00, the doctorwasn't able<br> to determine the cause ofdeath.<br> Two hours later,<br> he said it was poison.<br> Oh, now I see whatyou're saying.<br> It had to be Professor Plum<br> in the librarywith a candlestick.<br> - I'm gonna talk toyour supervisor.<br> - Okay.<br> Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue.<br> It's the big white house<br> with the pillars in front.<br> - Thankyou.<br> - I don't thinkyou'll have much luck.<br> I was assigned by Division.<br> Somebody over there thinks<br> I'm a pretty good lawyer.<br> So while I appreciateyour interest<br> and admireyour enthusiasm...<br> I think I can handle things myself.<br> You know what a Code Red is?<br> What a pity.<br> - Morning, sir.<br> - Morning.<br> Officer on deck!<br> Sir, Lance Corporal<br> Harold W.

The man was dead. Let's go.<br> I'm just wondering ifyou've ever heard<br> the term ''Code Red.''<br> I've heard the term, yes.<br> This past February,<br> you received a cautionary memo...<br> from the commander-in-chief<br> ofthe Atlantic fleet...<br> warning that the practice<br> ofenlisted men...<br> disciplining their own<br> wasn't to be condoned by officers.<br> Well, I submit toyou<br> that whoeverwrote that memo...<br> has never faced the working end...<br> ofa Soviet-made<br> Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.<br> However, the directive<br> having come from the commander...<br> I gave it its due attention.<br> - What is your point,Jo?<br> - She has no point.<br> She often has no point.<br> It's part ofher charm.<br> - We're out ofhere.

I wasjust saying<br> to myselfit's been almost three hours.<br> - Markinson's disappeared.<br> - What?<br> Colonel Markinson's gone U.A.--<br> unauthorized absence.<br> I know what it means.<br> When?<br> This afternoon.<br> Sometime afterwe left.<br> - I'll try to find him in the morning.<br> - I've already tried.<br> You tried?<br> Joanne, you're coming dangerously close<br> to the textbook definition...<br> ofinterfering<br> with a government investigation.<br> I'm Louden Downey's attorney.<br> Aunt Ginny. She says she feels<br> like she's known me foryears.<br> So I suggested that she might feel<br> more comfortable...<br> ifI were directly involved<br> with the case.<br> She had Louden sign the papers<br> about an hour ago.<br> I suppose<br> it's way too much to hope...<br> thatyou're making this up<br> just to bother me.<br> Don't worry. I'm not gonna<br> make a motion for separation.<br> - You're still lead counsel.<br> - Splendid.<br> I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red,<br> and so doyou.<br> Let's go.<br> Officer on deck!<br> - Did Kendrick order the Code Red?<br> - Sir?<br> Don't say ''Sir'' like I just asked you<br> ifyou cleaned the latrine.<br> You heard what I said. Did<br> Lieutenant Kendrick orderyou guys...<br> to give Santiago a Code Red?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Did he?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You mind telling me<br> whyyou never mentioned this before?<br> -You didn't ask.<br> -That won't win you a place in my heart.<br> I get paid no matter<br> how much timeyou spend injail.<br> Yes, sir. I knowyou do, sir.<br> - Fuckyou, Harold!<br> - All right.<br> At ease.<br> - Let's sort this thing out.<br> - Shit!<br> There was a platoon meeting<br> on September 6 at 4:00 in the afternoon.<br> Lieutenant Kendrick says<br> that he gave strict instructions...<br> that nothing was to happen<br> to Santiago.<br> Now, is this true?<br> I wantyou to speak freely.<br> Ma'am, that's correct...<br> but then he dismissed the platoon<br> and we all went to our rooms.<br> And what happened then?<br> Lieutenant Kendrick came<br> to our room, ma'am.<br> When?<br> About five minutes after the meeting<br> broke, sir. About 1 620.<br> And what happened then?<br> Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us<br> to give Santiago a Code Red.<br> Jack!<br> Hang on.<br> Theywere given an order.<br> -Jack, come on.<br> - Be right back.<br> - What areyou doin',Jack?<br> - Be right back.<br> - How long did you know about the order?<br> - I didn't. Who's this?<br> That'sJo Galloway, Downey's lawyer.<br> She's very pleased to meetyou.<br> - What exactly areyou accusing me of?<br> - How long did you know about the order?<br> He didn't, 'cause ifhe did<br> and hadn't told us...<br> he'd be violating about 1 4 articles<br> ofthe Code of Ethics.<br> He has enough to worry about...<br> God forbid our clients<br> decide to plead not guilty...<br> and testify for the record<br> that theywere given an order.<br> Kendrick specifically told those men<br> not to touch Santiago.<br> That's right. And then he went<br> into Dawson and Downey's room...<br> and specifically told them<br> to give him a Code Red.<br> - Kendrick said different. Have proof?<br> - He's lying.

Ifhe wants tojump<br> offa cliff, that's his business.<br> I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way.<br> I wanna get him a new lawyer. How?<br> Just make a motion tomorrow morning<br> at the arraignment.<br> Thejudge will askyou<br> ifyou want to enter a plea...<br> and you tell him thatyou want<br> to have new counsel assigned.<br> That's that.<br> One thing, though. When you ask<br> thejudge for new counsel...<br> Danny, be sure and ask nicely.<br> - What doyou want from me?<br> - I wantyou to let them bejudged.<br> I wantyou to stand up<br> and make an argument.<br> An argument that didn't work<br> for Calley at My Lai.<br> An argument that didn't work<br> for the Nazis at Nuremburg.<br> Oh, for Christ's sake, Sam.<br> Doyou really think that's the same<br> as two teenage Marines...<br> executing a routine order they never<br> believed would result in harm?<br> These guys aren't the Nazis.<br> Don't look now, Danny,<br> butyou're making an argument.<br> Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning<br> I get them a new attorney.<br> Why areyou so afraid<br> to be a lawyer?<br> Were Daddy's expectations<br> really that high?<br> Oh, please. Spare me<br> the psycho-babble father bullshit!<br> Dawson and Downeywill have their day<br> in court, but with another lawyer.<br> Another lawyerwon't be good enough.<br> They need you.<br> You know how to win. You know they have<br> a case, and you know how to win.<br> Ifyou walk away from this now,<br> you've sealed their fate.<br> Their fate was sealed<br> the moment Santiago died.<br> - Doyou believe they have a case?<br> - You and Dawson.<br> You both live<br> in the same dream world.<br> It doesn't matterwhat I believe.<br> It only matters what I can prove.<br> So, please, don't tell me<br> what I know and don't know!<br> I know the law!<br> You know nothing about the law.<br> You're a used car salesman, Daniel.<br> You're an ambulance chaser<br> with a rank.<br> You're nothing. Live with that.<br> So I toldDuncan...<br> ''Ifyou wanna take this to court<br> I'm gonna file nine discovery motions...<br> and you're gonna spend a year<br> going blind on paperwork...<br> because a 90-year-old man<br> misread the Delaware insurance code.''<br> - So what happened?<br> - He calls back 1 5 minutes later.<br> He says, '' Let's make a deal.''<br> All rise.<br> Where are we?<br> Docket number 41 1 275VR-5.<br> The UnitedStates v.<br> Lance CorporalHarold W. Dawson...<br> andPrivate First Class Louden Downey.<br> The accused are charged with murder,<br> conspiracy to commit murder...<br> and conduct unbecoming<br> a United States Marine.<br> Does the defense wish to enter a plea?<br> Yeah.<br> They're not guilty.<br> Enter a plea ofnot guilty<br> for the accused.<br> We'll adjourn until 1 000,<br> three weeks from today...<br> at which time this general<br> court-martial will reconvene.<br> Why does a lieutenantjunior grade<br> with ninth months' experience...<br> and a track record for plea bargaining<br> get assigned a murder case?<br> Would it be so that it never sees<br> the inside ofa courtroom?<br> We'll work out ofmy apartment<br> every night, 7:00.<br> Jo, pick up a carton oflegal pads, half<br> a dozen boxes ofred and black pens.<br> Sam, get a couple ofdesk lamps.<br> I need a preliminary medical profile.<br> Jo, we need all proficiency and conduct<br> reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago.<br> The only thing I have to eat<br> is Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs...<br> so ifyou want anything else,<br> bring it with you.<br> - Okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> So this is what<br> a courtroom looks like.<br> Wereyou able to speak<br> toyour friend at the N.I.S.?<br> Yeah. She said if Markinson<br> doesn't want to be found...<br> we're not gonna find him.<br> She said I could be Markinson,<br> and you wouldn't know it.<br> Areyou Markinson?<br> I'm not Markinson.<br> That's two down.<br> What?<br> I'm just wondering,<br> now thatJoanne's on this--<br> I'm just wondering<br> ifyou still need me.<br> - Theywere following orders.<br> - An illegal order.<br> Doyou think they knew<br> it was an illegal order?<br> It doesn't matterwhat they knew.<br> Any decent person would have refused--<br> They're not permitted<br> to question orders.<br> Then what's the secret? Huh?<br> What are the magic words?<br> I give orders every day--<br> We have softball games<br> and marching bands.<br> Theywork at a place whereyou have to<br> wear camouflage oryou might get shot!<br> I need you.<br> You're better at research than I am,<br> and you know how to prepare a witness.<br> I've got medical reports<br> and Chinese food. I saywe eat first.<br> What?<br> You got any kung pao chicken?<br> This is our defense-- intent. No one<br> can prove there was poison on the rag.<br> Code Red-- they're common<br> and accepted in Guantanamo Bay.<br> The order-- A: Kendrick gave it,<br> B: They had to follow it.<br> - That's it.<br> - What about motive?<br> We're a little weak on motive.<br> They had one.<br> - That doesn't mean they're guilty.<br> - Relax.<br> We'll deal with the fenceline shooting<br> when it comes up.<br> Let's start with intent. I don't<br> want to know what made Santiago die.<br> I just want to show it could've been<br> something other than poison.<br> Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything<br> there is to know about lactic acidosis.<br> This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway<br> with theJAG Corps in Washington.<br> I've been trying to track down<br> a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.<br> Doctor, was there any sign<br> ofexternal damage?<br> No scrapes? No cuts?<br> Bruises? Broken bones?<br> - Was there any sign ofviolence?<br> - You mean, other than the dead body?<br> Shit, I walk into that<br> every goddamn time.<br> He ordered me and Lance Corporal Dawson<br> to give Willie a Code Red.<br> Answers still have to come<br> much faster.<br> This Iowa farm boy thing<br> will play for a while...<br> but in the end, it sounds<br> like he's searching for the truth.<br> He's right. From now on,<br> Willie is Private Santiago.<br> You start calling him Willie,<br> and all ofa sudden he's a person...<br> who's got a mother<br> who's gonna miss him, okay?<br> They drewthe courtmembers<br> thisafternoon.<br> Will do.<br> Sevenmen, two women,<br> five Navy, four Marines.<br> Allofficers with line experience.<br> Neitherofthe womenhave children.<br> That'sabadbreak.<br> There'snothing we can do.<br> My fatheralwayssaidajury trial<br> isnotjustabout thelaw.<br> It'saboutassigningblame.<br> Santiago's dead, andheshouldn'tbe.<br> Theseninepeoplearegonnainsist<br> thatsomeonebeblamedforthat.<br> Ross ishanding them our clients.<br> We'regonnahandthem Kendrick.<br> This isaboutasalespitch.<br> It'sgonnabe wonby thelawyers.<br> Soremember, pokerfaces.

I was expecting<br> someone older.<br> So was I.<br> Last chance.<br> I'll flipyou for it.<br> - All rise.<br> - Too late.<br> All those having business<br> with this general court-martial...<br> stand forward<br> and you shall be heard.<br> ColonelJulius Alexander Randolph<br> is presiding.<br> Is the government prepared<br> to make an opening statement?<br> Yes, sir.<br> The facts ofthe case are these:<br> On midnight ofSeptember 6,<br> the accused entered the barracks room...<br> oftheir platoon mate,<br> P.F.C. William Santiago.<br> Theywoke him up,<br> tied his arms and legs with tape...<br> and forced a rag into his throat.<br> A few minutes later, a chemical reaction<br> called lactic acidosis...<br> caused his lungs to begin bleeding.<br> He drowned in his own blood...<br> and was pronounced dead<br> at 37 minutes past midnight.<br> These are the facts ofthe case,<br> and they are undisputed.<br> That's right.<br> The story I'vejust told you...<br> is the exact same storyyou're gonna<br> hear from Lance Corporal Dawson...<br> and it's the exact same story<br> you're gonna hear from Private Downey.<br> Furthermore, the government<br> will also demonstrate...<br> that the accused<br> soaked the rag in poison...<br> and entered Santiago's room<br> with motive and intent to kill.<br> Now, Lieutenant Kaffee...<br> is gonna try and pull off<br> a little magic act here.<br> He's gonna try a little misdirection.<br> He's gonna astonish you<br> with stories ofrituals...<br> and dazzleyou<br> with official-sounding terms...<br> like ''Code Red.''<br> He might even try to cut into<br> a few officers foryou.<br> He'll have no evidence, mind you, none,<br> but it's gonna be entertaining.<br> And when we get to the end,<br> all the magic in the world...<br> will not have been able to divert<br> your attention from the fact...<br> that Willie Santiago is dead<br> and Dawson and Downey killed him.<br> These are the facts ofthe case,<br> and they are undisputed.<br> Lieutenant Kaffee.<br> There was no poison on the rag,<br> and there was no intent to kill.<br> Any attempt to prove otherwise is futile<br> 'cause itjust ain't true.<br> When Dawson and Downeywent<br> into Santiago's room that night...<br> it wasn't because ofvengeance<br> or hatred.<br> It wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't<br> because theywere looking for kicks.<br> It's because it was<br> what theywere ordered to do.<br> Let me say that again.<br> It's because it was<br> what theywere ordered to do.<br> Out in the real world<br> that means nothing...<br> and here at the Washington NavyYard<br> it doesn't mean a whole lot more.<br> But ifyou're a Marine assigned<br> to Rifle Security CompanyWindward...<br> Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,<br> and you're given an order...<br> you follow it<br> oryou packyour bags.<br> Make no mistake about it.<br> Harold Dawson and Louden Downey<br> are sitting beforeyou today...<br> because they did theirjob.<br> Is the government ready<br> to call its first witness?<br> Ifit please the court,<br> the government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.<br> Mr. McGuire, would you<br> raiseyour right hand, please?<br> Doyou solemnly swear that the testimony<br> you give this general court-martial...<br> will be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> - I do.<br> - Have a seat, please, sir.<br> Would you stateyour full name<br> and occupation, for the record?<br> Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent,<br> Naval Investigative Service.<br> Mr. McGuire, did your office receive<br> a letter from P.F.C. William Santiago...<br> on 3 September ofthis year?<br> - We did.<br> - What did that letter say?<br> That a member ofSantiago's unit<br> had fired his weapon over the fenceline.<br> Was that Marine<br> identified in the letter?<br> No. I notified the barracks C.O.<br> ColonelJessup...<br> that I would be coming down<br> to investigate.<br> And what did you find?<br> The shift reported only one sentry<br> returned his weapon to the switch...<br> with a round ofammunition missing.<br> - Who was that?<br> - Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.<br> Yourwitness.<br> Mr. McGuire, haveyou questioned Dawson<br> about the fenceline shooting?<br> Yes. He claims to have been engaged<br> in some manner by the enemy.<br> - You don' believe him?<br> - It's not my place--<br> Lance Corporal Dawson's been charged<br> with a number ofcrimes.<br> Whywasn't he charged with firing<br> at the enemywithout cause?<br> There wasn't enough evidence<br> to support such a charge.<br> Thankyou.<br> Mr. McGuire, I don't understand<br> whatyou mean when you say...<br> ''There wasn't enough evidence<br> to support such a charge.''<br> You had William Santiago's letter.<br> Santiago was the only eyewitness.<br> I never had the chance to interview him,<br> so I don't know what he saw.<br> And now we'll never know,<br> will we, Mr. McGuire?<br> - No more questions.<br> - The witness is excused.<br> Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker,<br> Marine Barracks...<br> Rifle Security CompanyWindward,<br> Second Platoon Bravo.<br> Corporal, wereyou present at a meeting<br> that Lieutenant Kendrick held...<br> on the afternoon ofSeptember 6<br> with the members ofthe Second Platoon?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Would you tell the court<br> the substance ofthat meeting?<br> Lieutenant Kendrick told us<br> we had an informer in our group--<br> that Private Santiago had gone<br> outside the chain ofcommand...<br> and reported to the N.I.S.<br> on a member ofour platoon.<br> Did that makeyou mad?<br> You can tell the truth, Corporal.<br> - Did it makeyou mad?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> How mad?<br> Private Santiago betrayed a code<br> we believe in very deeply, sir.<br> - Were the other squad members angry?<br> - Object. Speculation.<br> - Were Dawson and Downey?<br> - Is the government counsel...<br> honestly asking the witness to testify<br> as to how my clients felt?<br> Sustained.<br> Corporal, did Lieutenant Kendrick<br> leave a standing order at that meeting?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What was it?<br> Well, it was clear that he didn't want<br> us taking matters into our own hands.<br> What was the order?<br> Sir, he said Santiago<br> wasn't to be touched.<br> Yourwitness.<br> Corporal Hammaker, wereyou<br> in Dawson and Downey's barracks...<br> five minutes after this meeting?<br> No, sir.<br> Thanks.<br> I have no more questions.<br> The witness is excused.<br> The government calls<br> Corporal Raymond Thomas.<br> I understand Captain Ross is planning<br> on calling all the other members...<br> of Rifle Security CompanyWindward<br> to testify.<br> In light ofthe defense Lieutenant<br> Kaffee is planning to mount...<br> the explicit instructions ofa platoon<br> leader seems particularly relevant.<br> The defense is willing to concede<br> that all 22 witnesses...<br> will testify substantially<br> as Corporal Hammaker did...<br> ifthe government is willing to concede<br> that none ofthem...<br> were in Dawson and Downey's room<br> at 1 6:20 on September 6.<br> Captain?<br> The government will stipulate.<br> Then we'll adjourn for the day.<br> You can call your next witness tomorrow.<br> All rise.<br> I want to go over the doctor again.<br> - We're taking the right approach.<br> - We've been over this already.<br> Listen to me. 3:00-- Stone says<br> he doesn't know what killed Santiago.<br> Then he meets withJessup,<br> and at 5:00 he says it was poison?<br> - The doctor's not telling the truth.<br> - Oh, that's a relief!.<br> I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use<br> the ''liar, liar, pants on fire'' defense.<br> We can't prove coercion.<br> Let's go overwhat we have, okay?<br> PrivateSantiago wasadmitted<br> to the E.R. at0012...<br> and he was pronounced dead<br> at 0037.<br> Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?<br> Ifthe muscles and other cells<br> ofthe body burn sugar...<br> instead ofoxygen,<br> lactic acid is produced.<br> That lactic acid is what caused<br> Santiago's lungs to bleed.<br> Normally, how long does it take<br> for the muscles and other cells...<br> to begin burning sugar<br> instead ofoxygen?<br> Twenty to thirty minutes.<br> And what caused this process<br> to be sped up in Santiago's muscles?<br> An ingested poison ofsome kind.<br> Your Honor, we object at this point.<br> The witness is speculating.<br> Commander Stone is an expert<br> medical witness.<br> In this courtroom, his opinion<br> is not considered speculation.<br> Commander Stone is an internist,<br> not a criminologist.<br> The medical facts here<br> are ultimately inconclusive.<br> A point I'm confidentyou'll illustrate<br> to the court under cross-examination.<br> So I'm sureyou won't mind<br> ifhis opinion is admitted now.<br> Not at all, sir.<br> Dr. Stone, did Willie Santiago<br> die ofpoisoning?<br> Absolutely.<br> You're aware that the lab and coroner's<br> report show no traces ofpoison?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Then how doyoujustify--<br> There are literally dozens oftoxins<br> which are virtually undetectable...<br> both in the human body<br> and on a fabric.<br> The nature ofthe acidosis<br> is the compelling factor on this issue.<br> Thankyou, sir.<br> Commander, is it possible for a person<br> to have an affliction--<br> some sort ofcondition-- which might<br> speed up the process ofacidosis?<br> Commander, is it possible?<br> It's possible.<br> What might some ofthose<br> conditions be?<br> Ifa person had a coronary disorder...<br> or a cerebral disorder,<br> the process would be more rapid.<br> IfI had a coronary condition and<br> a clean rag was placed in my mouth...<br> and the rag was pushed too far down,<br> is it possible that my cells...<br> would continue burning sugar<br> after the rag was taken out?<br> It would have to be<br> a very serious condition.<br> Is it possible to have<br> a serious coronary condition...<br> where the warning signals were so mild<br> as to escape a physician...<br> during a routine medical exam?<br> Possibly. There would still<br> be symptoms, though.<br> - What kind ofsymptoms?<br> - There are hundreds--<br> - Chest pains?<br> - Yes.<br> - Shortness ofbreath?<br> - Yes.<br> - Fatigue?<br> - Ofcourse.<br> Doctor, is this your signature?<br> Yes, it is.<br> This is an order for Private Santiago<br> to be put on restrictive duty.<br> Would you read your handwritten remarks<br> at the bottom ofthe page, please?<br> ''Initial testing, negative.<br> Patient complains ofchest pains...<br> shortness ofbreath and fatigue.<br> Restricted from running distances<br> over five miles for one week.''<br> Commander, isn't it possible<br> that Santiago had a serious condition...<br> and it was that condition that caused<br> the accelerated chemical reaction?<br> It's not possible?<br> I personally give each man<br> a thorough physical examination.<br> Private Santiago was given<br> a clean bill ofhealth.<br> That's why it had to be poison,<br> right, Commander?<br> 'Cause ifyou put a man with a serious<br> coronary condition on duty...<br> and that man died<br> from a heart-related incident...<br> you'd have a lot to answer for,<br> wouldn'tyou, Doctor?<br> - Object! Move to strike.<br> - Sustained.<br> I have no more questions,<br> Your Honor.<br> Dr. Stone, you've held<br> a medical license for 1 7 years.<br> You're Board-certified<br> in internal medicine.<br> You are chiefofinternal medicine<br> at a hospital which serves 5,426 people.<br> In your professional medical opinion,<br> was Willie Santiago poisoned?<br> We renew our objection<br> to Commander Stone's testimony...<br> and ask that it be stricken<br> from the record.<br> We further ask the court members to lend<br> no weight to this witness's testimony.<br> The objection is overruled.<br> The defense strenuously objects<br> and requests an 802 conference...<br> so that His Honor might have a chance<br> to hear discussion before ruling.<br> The objection ofthe defense<br> has been heard and overruled.<br> - Move to reconsider.<br> - Your objection is noted.<br> The witness is an expert,<br> and the court will hear his opinion!<br> Dr. Stone, in your expert,<br> professional opinion...<br> was Willie Santiago poisoned?<br> Yes.<br> Thankyou, sir.<br> I have no more questions.<br> Commander, you may step down.<br> Please the court, while we reserve<br> the right to call rebuttal witnesses...<br> the government rests.<br> We'll stand in recess until 1 000,<br> Monday the 1 9th...<br> at which time, the defense<br> will call its first witness.<br> All rise.<br> ''I strenuously object''?<br> Is that how it works?<br> ''Objection overruled.''<br> '' No, no. I strenuously object.''<br> ''Oh, well, ifyou strenuously object,<br> then I should take time to reconsider.''<br> I got it on the record.<br> You also got the court members<br> thinking we're afraid ofthe doctor.<br> You object once, so they can hear us say<br> he's not a criminologist.<br> You keep after it, and suddenly it looks<br> like a bunch offancy lawyer tricks.<br> It's the difference between paper law<br> and trial law.<br> You even had thejudge saying<br> Stone was an expert!<br> She made a mistake.<br> Let's not relive it.<br> I'm gonna go call mywife.<br> I'll seeyou tonight.<br> Why doyou hate them so much?<br> They beat up on a weakling.<br> That's all they did.<br> The rest ofthis isjust<br> smoke-filled coffeehouse crap.<br> They tortured and tormented<br> a weaker kid!<br> They didn't like him,<br> so they killed him.<br> And why? Because<br> he couldn't run very fast!<br> All right.<br> Everybody take the night off.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - I know.<br> We've been working 20 hours a day<br> for three and halfweeks straight.<br> Just take the night off.<br> Go seeyourwife, your daughter.<br> Jo, go do...<br> whatever it is you do<br> when you're not here.<br> - What day is tomorrow?<br> - Saturday.<br> We start at 1 0:00.<br> Why doyou like them so much?<br> 'Cause they stand on a wall....<br> and they say, '' Nothing's gonna hurtyou<br> tonight, not on mywatch.''<br> Don't worry about the doctor.<br> This trial starts Monday.<br> Andaline drive toleftcenter.<br> Kirbyracing.<br> He won'tget there.<br> Androunding thirdis CalRipken...<br> andthe Twins'streakis over.<br> Onestrikeaway, andRandy Milligan<br> feels rightnowlike Hulk Hogan.<br> I'm sorry to botheryou.<br> I should've called first.<br> No, I wasjust watching<br> a ball game.

Did you hear<br> what I said about the flight?<br> Sam, when a flight takes off,<br> there's a record kept, right?<br> Yeah, you need the tower chiefs log<br> from Gitmo.<br> - Get it.<br> - We're gonna win.<br> We don't know who Markinson is.<br> We don't know what the logbookwill say.<br> Youjust concentrate on Downey.<br> I'm gonna tell Ross where we are.<br> Nice work today.<br> Redirect on Barnes.<br> - I have Markinson.<br> - Where is he?<br> Motel room in Northeast with<br> six Federal Marshalls outside his door.<br> The transfer that Markinson<br> signed is phony.<br> Jessup's statement that the 6:00 a.m.<br> flight was the first available is a lie.<br> We're checking the tower chiefs log.<br> I'd like a beer, please.<br> In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick<br> on the stand and have some fun.<br> All right, I have<br> an obligation to tell you...<br> that ifyou accuse Kendrick orJessup<br> ofany crime without proper evidence...<br> you'll be subject to a court-martial<br> for professional misconduct.<br> That's something that'll be stapled to<br> everyjob application you ever fill out.<br> Markinson's not gonna hold up, Danny.<br> He's a crazy man.<br> I'm not saying this to intimidateyou.<br> I'm being your lawyer here.<br> Thanks,Jack. And I think the fucking<br> bunch ofyou are certifiably insane.<br> Your code ofhonor makes me<br> want to beat the shit out ofsomebody.<br> Don't lump me in with them<br> just because we wear the same uniform.<br> I'm your friend, and I don't think<br> your clients belong injail...<br> but I don't get<br> to make that decision.<br> I represent the United States government<br> without passion or prejudice.<br> - My client has a case.<br> - Hereyou go.<br> I wantyou to acknowledge that<br> thejudge advocate has madeyou aware...<br> ofthe possible consequences involved<br> in accusing a Marine officer...<br> ofa felony<br> without proper evidence.<br> I've been so advised.<br> You got bullied<br> into that courtroom, Danny.<br> By everyone.<br> By Dawson, by Galloway.<br> Shit, I practically dared you.<br> You got bullied into that courtroom<br> by the memory ofa dead lawyer.<br> You're a lousy fucking<br> softball player,Jack!<br> Your boys are going down, Danny.<br> I can't stop it anymore.<br> Lieutenant Kendrick, in your opinion,<br> was Private Santiago a good Marine?<br> I'd say he was about average.<br> You signed three proficiency<br> and conduct reports on Santiago.<br> On all three reports, you indicate<br> a rating ofbelow average.<br> Yes, Private Santiago<br> was below average.<br> I did not see the need<br> to trample on a man's grave.<br> We appreciate that,<br> butyou're under oath now.<br> Unpleasant as it may be,<br> we'd all just as soon hear the truth.<br> I'm aware ofmy oath.<br> These are the last three pro-con reports<br> you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.<br> Dawson received<br> two marks ofexceptional...<br> but on this most recent report ofJune 9<br> he received a rating ofbelow average.<br> - I'd like to discuss this last report.<br> - That would be fine.<br> Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after<br> the school ofinfantrywas perfect.<br> Over halfthat class has since<br> been promoted to full corporal...<br> while Dawson has remained<br> a lance corporal.<br> Was Dawson's promotion held up<br> because ofthis last report?<br> I'm sure it was.<br> Doyou recall why Dawson was given<br> such a poor grade on this report?<br> I'm sure I don't.<br> I have many men in my charge.<br> I write many reports.<br> Lieutenant, doyou recall an incident<br> involving a P.F.C. Curtis Bell...<br> who'd been found stealing liquor<br> from the Officers' Club?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Did you report Private Bell<br> to proper authorities?<br> I have two books at my bedside--<br> The Marine Corps Code ofConduct<br> and The KingJames Bible.<br> The only proper authorities I'm aware of<br> are my commanding officer...<br> Colonel Nathan R.Jessup<br> and the Lord our God.<br> Atyour request, Lieutenant Kendrick,<br> I can have the record reflect...<br> your lack ofacknowledgement<br> ofthis court as a proper authority.<br> - Objection. Argumentative.<br> - Sustained.<br> Watch yourself, counselor.<br> Did you report Private Bell<br> toyour superiors?<br> I remember thinking very highly<br> of Private Bell--<br> not wanting to see his record tarnished<br> by a formal charge.<br> You preferred it be handled<br> within the unit?<br> Yes, I most certainly did.<br> - Doyou know what a Code Red is?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Haveyou ever ordered a Code Red?<br> - No, I have not.<br> Did you order Dawson and two other men<br> to make sure that Private Bell...<br> received no food or drink, except water,<br> for a period ofseven days?<br> That is a distortion<br> ofthe truth, Lieutenant.<br> Private Bell was placed<br> on barracks restriction.<br> He was given water and vitamin<br> supplements, and I can assureyou...<br> at no time<br> was his health in danger.<br> I'm sure it was lovely<br> for Private Bell.<br> Butyou did order<br> the barracks restriction, didn'tyou?<br> - You did order the denial offood?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> Wouldn't this form ofdiscipline<br> be considered a Code Red?<br> IfI called the other 478 Marines<br> at Guantanamo Bay to testify...<br> would they consider it<br> a Code Red?<br> The witness can't possibly testify<br> as to what 478 other men would say.<br> We object to this entire line<br> ofquestioning. It's argumentative...<br> and irrelevant badgering<br> ofthe witness.<br> The government's objection<br> is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee...<br> and I would remind you thatyou're now<br> questioning a Marine officer...<br> with an impeccable service record.<br> Thankyou, Your Honor.<br> Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating<br> ofbelow average on this last report...<br> becauseyou learned he'd been sneaking<br> food to Private Bell?<br> - Object!<br> - Not so fast. Lieutenant?<br> Lance Corporal Dawson<br> was given a below average rating...<br> because he had committed a crime.<br> A crime?<br> What crime did he commit?<br> Dawson brought a hungry guy some food.<br> What crime did he commit?<br> He disobeyed an order.<br> And because he exercised<br> his own set ofvalues...<br> because he made a decision<br> about the welfare ofa Marine...<br> that was in conflict with your order,<br> he was punished, is that right?<br> Lance Corporal Dawson<br> disobeyed an order.<br> Yeah, but it wasn't<br> a real order, was it?<br> After all, it's peacetime.<br> He wasn't being asked to secure a hill<br> or advance on a beachhead.<br> I mean, surely a Marine<br> of Dawson's intelligence...<br> can be trusted to determine on his own<br> which are the important orders...<br> and which orders might, say,<br> be morally questionable?<br> Can he?<br> Can Dawson determine on his own<br> which orders he's going to follow?<br> No, he cannot.<br> A lesson he learned<br> after the Curtis Bell incident, right?<br> - I would think so.<br> - You know so, don'tyou?<br> - Object!<br> - Sustained.<br> Lieutenant Kendrick,<br> one final question.<br> Ifyou had ordered Dawson<br> to give Santiago a Code Red--<br> - I specifically ordered those men--<br> - Would he disobeyyou again?<br> - Lieutenant, don't answer that!<br> - You don't have to. I'm through.<br> Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order<br> Lance Corporal Dawson...<br> and Private Downey<br> to give Willie Santiago a Code Red?<br> - No, I did not.<br> - Thankyou.<br> What's the word?<br> I got the tower chiefs log from that<br> night.Jessup's telling the truth.<br> - 6:00 a.m. flight was the first plane.<br> - Let me see this.<br> - Working late tonight?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> There wasn't a flight at 1 1 :00.<br> What the fuck areyou trying to pull?<br> The first flight stateside<br> left Guantanamo Bay at 2300.<br> It arrived at Andrews Air Force Base<br> at a few minutes past 2:00.<br> Really? Then why isn't it<br> listed in the tower chiefs log?<br> Jessup.<br> What areyou telling me?<br> He fixed the logbook?<br> Maybe he can make it so a plane didn't<br> take off, but I can prove one landed.<br> I'll get the logbook from Andrews.<br> You're not gonna find anything<br> in the Andrews logbook, either.<br> He can make<br> an entire flight disappear?<br> Jessup is about to be appointed director<br> ofoperations for the Security Council.<br> You don't get to that position without<br> knowing how to sidestep some land mines.<br> He's not gonna be able<br> to sidestepyou.<br> You don't still intend<br> to put me on the stand?<br> Thursday morning, 1 0:00.<br> There's gotta be someone<br> who can testify to the flight.<br> This isn't TWA.<br> There isn't a regular flight schedule.<br> Doyou have any idea how many planes<br> take offand land every day?<br> A ground crew kid won't remember<br> a flight that landed fourweeks ago.<br> - How doyou know ifyou don't check?<br> - Forget the flight!<br> Markinson will testify thatJessup<br> refused to transfer Santiago.<br> He'll testify to the forged transfer,<br> and that'll be enough.<br> That and Downey's testimony<br> really ought to be enough.<br> Why did you go into Santiago's room<br> on the night ofthe 6th?<br> To give Private Santiago<br> a Code Red, ma'am.<br> Why did you give him a Code Red?<br> I was ordered to give him a Code Red<br> by the platoon commander...<br> of Rifle Security CompanyWindward,<br> LieutenantJonathanJames Kendrick.<br> You're gonna do fine.<br> You think they'll let us go back<br> to our platoon soon, ma'am?<br> Absolutely.<br> Doyou remember the order ofquestions?<br> Areyou sure?<br> And we'll use small words, 'cause he<br> gets rattled ifhe doesn't understand.<br> - I'm just saying go slow.<br> - I'm gonna go slow.<br> And get him off<br> as fast as you can.<br> What?<br> It's gonna be fine.<br> DearMr. andMrs. Santiago...<br> I was William's executive officer.<br> Iknewyourson vaguely,<br> which is tosayIknewhisname.<br> Inamatteroftime,<br> the trialofthe twomen...<br> chargedwithyourson's death<br> willbe concluded...<br> andsevenmenandtwo women<br> whomyou'venevermet...<br> will tryto offeryouan explanation<br> as to why William is dead.<br> Formypart, I've doneasmuch as Ican<br> tobring the truth tolight.<br> Andthe truth is this--<br> Yoursonis deadforonlyonereason--<br> I wasn'tstrongenough tostopit.<br> Always, Lieutenant Colonel<br> MatthewAndrewMarkinson...<br> UnitedStates Marine Corps.<br> Private, I wantyou<br> to tell us one last time.<br> Why did you go to Private Santiago's<br> room on the night ofSeptember 6?<br> A Code Red was ordered<br> by my platoon commander...<br> LieutenantJonathanJames Kendrick.<br> Thankyou.<br> Yourwitness.<br> Private, the week of2 September...<br> the switch log has you down<br> at Post 39 until 1 600.<br> Is that correct?<br> I'm sure it is, sir.<br> They keep that log pretty good.<br> How far is it from Post 39<br> to the Windward Barracks?<br> Well, it's a ways, sir.<br> It's a hike.<br> About how far byJeep?<br> About ten or fifteen minutes, sir.<br> You ever had to walk it?<br> Yes, sir. That day, Friday.<br> The pickup private--<br> That's what we call the guy<br> who drops us offand picks us up...<br> also 'cause he can get girls<br> in New York City.<br> The pickup private got a flat,<br> sir, right at 39.<br> He pulled up and, bam,<br> blowout with no spare.<br> So we had to double-time it<br> back to the barracks.<br> And ifit's about ten or fifteen<br> minutes byJeep, I'm guessing...<br> it must be a good hour by foot,<br> am I right?<br> Pickup and me did it<br> in 45 flat, sir.<br> Not bad.<br> You've said thatyour assault<br> on Private Santiago...<br> was a result ofan order<br> that Lieutenant Kendrick gaveyou...<br> in your barracks room<br> at 1 620, am I right?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Butyoujust said thatyou didn't<br> make it back to the barracks until 1 645.<br> Well, ifyou didn't make it back<br> to the barracks until 1 645...<br> how could you be<br> in your room at 1 620?<br> Well, you see, sir,<br> there was a blowout--<br> Did you ever actually hear<br> Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?<br> Well, Hal said that--<br> Private, did you ever<br> actually hear...<br> Lieutenant Kendrick<br> order a Code Red?<br> I'd like to request a recess<br> in order to conferwith my client.<br> - Why did you go into Santiago's room?<br> - The witness has rights!<br> - The witness has been read his rights.<br> - The question will be repeated.<br> Why did you go<br> into Santiago's room?<br> Did Lance Corporal Dawson tell you<br> to give Santiago a Code Red?<br> - Don't look at him!<br> - Hal!<br> Answer the captain's question!<br> Yes, Captain, I was given an order<br> by my squad leader...<br> Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson,<br> United States Marine Corps...<br> and I followed it.<br> Where doyou think he is?<br> As far as Downeywas concerned,<br> it was an order from Kendrick.<br> It doesn't matter that<br> he didn't hear it firsthand.<br> He doesn't distinguish<br> between the two.<br> Danny, I'm sorry.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Sam and I werejust talking about<br> how all we really have to do...<br> is call some witnesses<br> who will talk about implied orders.<br> Maybe we can put Downey back<br> on the stand before we get to Dawson.<br> Ifwe work at it, we can get Dawson<br> charged with the Kennedy assassination.<br> Areyou drunk?<br> Pretty much.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll put on a pot ofcoffee.<br> We've got a long night's work ahead.<br> She's gonna make coffee.<br> That's nice.<br> Downeywasn't in his room.<br> Wasn't even there.<br> That was an important piece<br> ofinformation, don'tyou think?<br> Danny, it was a setback,<br> and I'm sorry.<br> But we fix it,<br> and move on to Markinson.<br> Markinson's dead.<br> You really gotta hand it<br> to those Federal Marshals, boy.<br> It's not like he hanged himself<br> by his shoelaces...<br> or slashed his wrists<br> with a concealed butter knife.<br> This guy...<br> got into full dress uniform,<br> stood in the middle ofthat room...<br> drew a nickel-plated pistol<br> from his holster...<br> and fired a bullet into his mouth.<br> Anyway, since we seem to be out of<br> witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.<br> I still thinkwe can win.<br> Maybeyou should drink a little.<br> We'll go to Randolph in the morning and<br> make a motion for a 24-hour continuance.<br> - Whywould we want to do that?<br> - To subpoena ColonelJessup.<br> - What?<br> - Listen for a second. Hear me out.<br> I won't listen,<br> and I won't hearyou out.<br> Your passion is compelling,Jo.<br> It's also useless.<br> Louden Downey<br> needed a trial lawyer today.<br> You're chickenshit.<br> You're gonna use what happened today<br> as an excuse to give up.<br> It's over.<br> Why did you askJessup<br> for the transfer order?<br> - In Cuba. Why?<br> - What does it matter?<br> - I wanted the damn transfer order!<br> - Bullshit.<br> You could've gotten it by calling<br> any department at the Pentagon.<br> You didn't want the transfer order.<br> You wanted to seeJessup's reaction.<br> You had an instinct,<br> and it was confirmed by Markinson.<br> Let's putJessup on the stand<br> and end this thing!<br> What possible good could come<br> from puttingJessup on the stand?<br> He told Kendrick<br> to order the Code Red.<br> He did? That's great!<br> Why didn'tyou say so?<br> And ofcourse<br> you have proofofthat!<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You were sick<br> the day they taught law at law school.<br> You put him on the stand,<br> and you get it from him.<br> Oh, we get it from him!<br> Yes! No problem!<br> ColonelJessup, isn't it true that<br> you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?<br> - Listen, we're all a little--<br> - I'm sorry. Your time's run out.<br> What do we have for the losers?<br> Well, for our defendants...<br> it's a lifetime<br> at exotic Fort Leavenworth.<br> And for Defense Counsel Kaffee...<br> it's a court-martial!<br> Yes,Johnny,<br> after falsely accusing...<br> a highly decorated Marine officer...<br> ofconspiracy and perjury...<br> Lieutenant Kaffee will have<br> a long and prosperous career...<br> teaching typewriter maintenance<br> at the Rocco Clubo School forWomen.<br> Thankyou for playing<br> ''Should we or should we not...<br> follow the advice<br> ofthe galactically stupid?''<br> I'm sorry I lost<br> your set ofsteak knives.<br> Stop cleaning up.<br> Stop cleaning up.<br> - Want a drink?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Is your father proud ofyou?<br> - Don't do this toyourself.<br> I'll bet he is.<br> I'll bet he bores the shit<br> out ofthe neighbors and relatives.<br> ''Sam's made LawReview.<br> He's got a big case he's making.<br> He's arguing.<br> He's making an argument.''<br> I think my fatherwould've enjoyed<br> seeing me graduate from law school.<br> I think he would've liked that<br> an awful lot.<br> Did I ever tell you I wrote a paper<br> aboutyour father in college?<br> Yeah?<br> One ofthe best<br> trial lawyers ever.<br> Yes, he was.<br> IfI were Dawson and Downey<br> and I had a choice...<br> between you oryour father<br> to represent me in this case...<br> I'd chooseyou any day ofthe week<br> and twice on Sunday.<br> You should've seen yourself<br> thunder away at Kendrick.<br> Would you putJessup on the stand?<br> - Doyou think my fatherwould have?<br> - With the evidence we got?<br> Not in a million years.<br> But here's the thing-- and there's<br> really know way ofgetting around this--<br> Neither Lyle Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg<br> are lead counsel for the defense...<br> in the matter of<br> U.S. v. DawsonandDowney.<br> So there's really only one question--<br> What would you do?<br> Jo, get in the car.<br> Joanne, please get in the car.<br> Look--<br> I apologize. I was angry.<br> I'm sorry about what I said.<br> I'm gonna putJessup on the stand.<br> Whatdoyousuggest we do?<br> I saywe hitJessup<br> with the phony transfer order.<br> What's a transfer order<br> without a witness?<br> - We have a witness.<br> - A dead witness.<br> In the hands ofa lesser attorney,<br> that would be a problem.<br> Look at this. Last night<br> he's swimming inJack Daniels...<br> and now he can leap tall buildings<br> in a single bound.<br> I'm getting my second wind.<br> Sit down, both ofyou.<br> Good.Jessup told Kendrick<br> to order the Code Red. Kendrick did.<br> Our clients followed the order.<br> The cover-up isn't our case.<br> To win,Jessup needs to tell the court<br> members that he ordered the Code Red.<br> - You thinkyou can get him to say it?<br> - I think he wants to say it.<br> I think he's pissed off<br> that he's got to hide from us.<br> I think he wants to say that he made<br> a command decision, and that's the end.<br> He eats breakfast 300 yards away...<br> from 4,000 Cubans<br> that are trained to kill him.<br> No one's gonna tell him<br> how to run his unit.<br> Least ofall the Harvard mouth<br> in his faggotywhite uniform.<br> I need to shake him,<br> put him on the defensive...<br> and lead him right<br> where he's dying to go.<br> - That's it? That's the plan?<br> - That's the plan.<br> - How areyou gonna do it?<br> - I have no idea.<br> - I need my bat.<br> - Yourwhat?<br> I think betterwith my bat.<br> Where's my bat?<br> - I put it in the closet.<br> - You put it in the closet?<br> - I was tripping on it.<br> - Don't ever put that bat in the closet.<br> - He thinks betterwith his bat?<br> - I can understand that.<br> Stay here.<br> I'm going to the office for a while.<br> He does think betterwith that bat.<br> Sam, I need you<br> to do something for me.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Gotta go out to Andrews.<br> - Where's Sam?<br> - He's on his way.<br> - Did he get the guys?<br> - Yeah.<br> Listen, can I talk toyou<br> for a second?<br> Oh, yeah, sure.<br> Howyou feeling?<br> Well, I thinkJessup's<br> gonna have his hands full today.<br> Listen, Danny...<br> when you're out there today...<br> ifyou feel like<br> it's not gonna happen...<br> ifyou feel like<br> he's not gonna say it...<br> don't go for it.<br> You could get in trouble.<br> I'm special counsel<br> for Internal Affairs...<br> and I'm telling you<br> you could get in a lot oftrouble.<br> Wait, Lieutenant Commander Galloway...<br> you're not suggesting<br> that I back offa material witness?<br> Ifyou thinkyou can't get him, yeah.<br> Allrise.<br> - Where's Sam?<br> - He's on his way.<br> - Call your first witness.<br> - Where is he?<br> - He'll be here.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> Call yourwitness.<br> Defense calls Colonel NathanJessup.<br> ColonelJessup, would you raise<br> your right hand please, sir?<br> Doyou solemnly swear that the testimony<br> you will give in this court-martial...<br> will be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Have a seat please, sir.<br> Would you stateyour name, rank<br> and current billet for the record, sir?<br> Colonel Nathan R.Jessup,<br> commanding officer...<br> Marine Ground Forces,<br> Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.<br> - Thankyou, sir.<br> - He's not here.<br> Colonel, when you learned<br> ofSantiago's letter to the N.I.S....<br> you had a meeting<br> with your two senior officers.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yes.<br> The platoon commander,<br> LieutenantJonathan Kendrick...<br> and the executive officer,<br> Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.<br> Yes.<br> And at present Colonel Markinson<br> is dead. Is that right?<br> Objection. I'd like to knowjust what<br> the defense counsel is implying.<br> I'm implying simply that at present<br> Colonel Markinson is not alive.<br> ColonelJessup doesn't need to appear<br> in court to confirm that information.<br> I just wasn't sure the witness was aware<br> that two days ago...<br> the colonel took his own life<br> with a .45-caliber pistol.<br> The witness is aware,<br> the court is aware...<br> and now the court members<br> are aware.<br> We thankyou for bringing this<br> to our attention.<br> Move on, Lieutenant..<br> Yes, sir.<br> Colonel, you gave Lieutenant Kendrick<br> an order at this meeting, right?<br> I told Kendrick to tell his men<br> that Santiago wasn't to be touched.<br> And did you give an order<br> to Colonel Markinson as well?<br> I ordered Markinson to have Santiago<br> transferred offthe base immediately.<br> Why?<br> I felt his life might be in danger<br> once word ofthe letter got out.<br> Grave danger?<br> Is there another kind?<br> Colonel, we have the transfer order<br> thatyou and Markinson co-signed...<br> ordering that Santiago be on a flight<br> leaving Guantanamo at 6:00 the next day.<br> - Was that the first flight?<br> - The 0600 was the first flight.<br> You flew up to Washington this morning.<br> Is that right?<br> I noticeyou're wearing your<br> class ''A'' dress uniform in court today.<br> - As areyou, Lieutenant.<br> - Did you wear that on the plane?<br> Please the court, is this dialogue<br> relevant to anything--<br> Defense didn't have the opportunity<br> to depose this witness.<br> - I'd ask for a little latitude.<br> - A very little latitude.<br> I wore utilities on the plane.<br> - You broughtyour dress uniform?<br> - Yes.<br> - Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?<br> - Your Honor!<br> Is the colonel's underwear<br> a matter ofnational security?<br> Gentlemen! You better get somewhere<br> fast with this, Lieutenant.<br> Yes, sir. Colonel?<br> I brought a change ofclothes<br> and some personal items.<br> Thankyou.<br> After Dawson and Downey's arrest<br> on the night ofthe sixth...<br> Santiago's barracks were sealed off<br> and its contents inventoried.<br> '' Four pairs camouflage pants,<br> three long-sleeve khaki shirts...<br> three pairs ofboots, four pairs<br> green socks, three green T-shirts--''<br> Please the court, is there a question<br> anywhere in our future?<br> Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to askyou<br> to stateyour question.<br> I'm wondering why Santiago<br> wasn't packed.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> We'll get back to that one in a minute.<br> This is a record ofall phone calls made<br> from your base in the past 24 hours.<br> After being subpoenaed to Washington,<br> you made three calls.<br> Doyou recognize<br> those number, sir?<br> I called Colonel Fitzhughes<br> in Quantico, Virginia.<br> I wanted to let him know<br> that I would be in town.<br> The second call was to arrange a meeting<br> with Congressman Richmond...<br> ofthe House Armed Services Committee.<br> And the third call<br> was to my sister Elizabeth.<br> Why did you make that call, sir?<br> I thought she might like<br> to have dinner tonight.<br> - I'm gonna stop this.<br> - These are phone records from Gitmo...<br> for September 6,<br> and these are 1 4 letters...<br> that Santiago wrote in nine months...<br> requesting-- in fact, begging--<br> for a transfer.<br> Upon hearing the news that<br> he was finally getting his transfer...<br> Santiago was so excited that<br> doyou know how many people he called?<br> Zero. Nobody.<br> Not one call to his parents<br> saying he was coming home.<br> Not one call to a friend, saying,<br> ''Can you pick me up at the airport?''<br> He was asleep in his bed at midnight,<br> and according toyou...<br> he was getting on a plane<br> in six hours.<br> Yet everything he owned<br> was hanging neatly in his closet...<br> and folded neatly in his footlocker.<br> You were leaving for one day.<br> You packed a bag and made three calls.<br> Santiago was leaving<br> for the rest ofhis life...<br> and he hadn't called a soul...<br> and he hadn't packed a thing.<br> Can you explain that?<br> The fact is,<br> there was no transfer order.<br> Santiago wasn't going anywhere.<br> Isn't that right, Colonel?<br> Objection. Your Honor, it's obvious<br> that Lieutenant Kaffee's intention...<br> is the smear<br> a high-ranking Marine officer...<br> in the hope that the mere appearance<br> ofimproprietywill win him points.<br> It's my recommendation, sir,<br> that Lieutenant Kaffee be reprimanded...<br> and the witness be excused<br> with the court's deepest apologies.<br> Overruled.<br> Your objection is noted.<br> Is this funny, sir?<br> No, it's not.<br> It's tragic.<br> - Doyou have an answer?<br> - Absolutely.<br> My answer is,<br> I don't have the first damn clue.<br> Maybe he was an early riser<br> and liked to pack in the morning.<br> And maybe he didn't have any friends.<br> I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid<br> I can't speak intelligently...<br> about the travel habits<br> ofWilliam Santiago.<br> What I do know is that he was set<br> to leave the base at 0600.<br> Now, are these really the questions<br> that I was called here to answer?<br> Phone calls and footlockers?<br> Please tell me thatyou have<br> something more, Lieutenant.<br> These two Marines<br> are on trial for their lives.<br> Please tell me that their lawyer hasn't<br> pinned their hopes to a phone bill.<br> Doyou have any other questions<br> for me, counselor?<br> Lieutenant, doyou have anything<br> further for this witness?<br> Thanks, Danny.<br> I love Washington.<br> Excuse me.<br> I didn't dismiss you.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I'm not through with my examination.<br> Sit down.<br> - Colonel.<br> - What's that?<br> I'd appreciate it ifyou'd address me<br> as ''colonel'' or ''sir.''<br> I believe I've earned it.<br> Defense counsel will address<br> the witness as ''colonel'' or ''sir.''<br> I don't know what the hell<br> kind ofunityou're running here.<br> The witness will address this court<br> as ''judge'' or ''your honor.''<br> I'm quite certain I've earned it.<br> Takeyour seat, Colonel.<br> What doyou want to discuss now?<br> My favorite color?<br> Colonel, the 6:00 a.m. flight<br> was the first one offthe base?<br> Yes.<br> There wasn't a flight<br> that left seven hours earlier...<br> and landed at Andrews Air Force Base<br> at 2:00 a.m.?<br> Lieutenant, I think<br> we've covered this, haven't we?<br> Your Honor, these are<br> the tower chiefs logs...<br> for both Guantanamo Bay<br> and Andrews Air Force Base.<br> The Guantanamo log lists no flight<br> that left at 1 1 :00 p.m.<br> The Andrews log lists no flight<br> that landed at 2:00 a.m.<br> I'd like to admit them<br> as defense exhibits Alpha and Bravo.<br> I don't understand. You're admitting<br> evidence ofa flight that never existed.<br> We believe it did, sir.<br> Defense will be calling Airmen<br> Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez.<br> Theywere working the ground crew<br> at Andrews at 2:00 a.m. on the 7th.<br> - These men weren't on the list.<br> - Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor...<br> called specifically to refute testimony<br> offered under direct examination.<br> - I'll allow the witnesses.<br> - This is ridiculous.<br> - Colonel, a moment ago--<br> - Check the tower logs, for God's sake!<br> We'll get to the airmen<br> injust a minute, sir.<br> A moment agoyou said that<br> you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick...<br> to tell his men<br> that Santiago wasn't to be touched.<br> That's right.<br> And Lieutenant Kendrickwas clear<br> on whatyou wanted?<br> Crystal.<br> Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick<br> ignored the order?<br> Ignored the order?<br> Any chance he forgot about it?<br> Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick leftyour<br> office and said, ''The old man is wrong''?<br> When Lieutenant Kendrick<br> spoke to the platoon...<br> and ordered them not to touch Santiago,<br> any chance they ignored him?<br> You ever served<br> in an infantry unit, son?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Ever served in a forward area?<br> Ever putyour life<br> in another man's hands?<br> Asked him to put his life in yours?<br> We follow orders, son.<br> We follow orders, or people die.<br> It's that simple.<br> Are we clear?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Are we clear?<br> Crystal.<br> I havejust one more question before<br> I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.<br> Ifyou gave an order<br> that Santiago wasn't to be touched...<br> and your orders<br> are always followed...<br> then whywould Santiago<br> be in danger?<br> Whywould it be necessary<br> to transfer him offthe base?<br> Santiago was a substandard Marine.<br> - He was being transferred--<br> - That's not whatyou said!<br> You said he was being transferred<br> because he was in grave danger.<br> I said, ''Grave danger?''<br> You said, ''Is there any other kind?''<br> - I recall what I said.<br> - I can have it read back toyou.<br> I know what I said!<br> I don't have to have it read back to me.<br> Then why the two orders?<br> Colonel?<br> Sometimes men take matters<br> into their own hands.<br> You've made it clear thatyour men<br> never take matters into their own hands.<br> Your men follow orders,<br> or people die.<br> So Santiago should have been<br> in danger, should he?<br> - You snotty little bastard.<br> - I'd like to ask for a recess.<br> - I'd like an answer to the question.<br> - The court will wait for an answer.<br> If Lieutenant Kendrick<br> gave an order...<br> that Santiago<br> wasn't to be touched...<br> then why did he<br> have to be transferred?<br> Lieutenant Kendrick ordered the Code Red<br> because that's whatyou told him to do!<br> - Object!<br> - And then you cut these guys loose!<br> - I'll hold you in contempt.<br> - You doctored the logbook!<br> - Damn it, Kaffee!<br> - Consideryourselfin contempt.<br> ColonelJessup,<br> did you order the Code Red?<br> - You don't have to answer that.<br> - I'll answer the question.<br> - You want answers?<br> - I think I'm entitled!<br> - You want answers?<br> - I want the truth!<br> You can't handle the truth!<br> Son, we live in a world<br> that has walls...<br> and those walls have to be guarded<br> by men with guns.<br> Who's gonna do it? You?<br> You, Lieutenant Weinberg?<br> I have a greater responsibility<br> than you can possibly fathom.<br> You weep for Santiago,<br> and you curse the Marines.<br> You have the luxury<br> ofnot knowing what I know--<br> that Santiago's death,<br> while tragic, probably saved lives.<br> And my existence, while grotesque and<br> incomprehensible toyou, saves lives!<br> You don't want the truth because<br> deep down you don't talk about...<br> you want me on that wall.<br> You need me on that wall!<br> We use words<br> like honor, code, loyalty.<br> We use these words as the backbone<br> ofa life spent defending something.<br> You use them as a punch line.<br> I have neither the time<br> nor the inclination to explain myself...<br> to a man who rises and sleeps under<br> the blanket ofthe freedom I provide...<br> and then questions the manner<br> in which I provide it!<br> I would ratheryoujust said thankyou<br> and went on yourway.<br> Otherwise, I suggestyou<br> pick up a weapon and stand a post.<br> Eitherway, I don't give a damn<br> whatyou thinkyou are entitled to!<br> Did you order the Code Red?<br> - I did thejob--<br> - Did you order the Code Red?<br> You're goddamned right I did!<br> Please the court,<br> I suggest the members be dismissed...<br> so that we can move to an immediate<br> Article 39-A session.<br> The witness has rights.<br> Captain Ross?<br> The members ofthe court will retire<br> to an anteroom until further instructed.<br> All rise.<br> What the hell is this?<br> Colonel, what's going on?<br> I did myjob.<br> I'd do it again.<br> I'm gonna get on a plane<br> and go on back to my base.<br> You're not going anywhere, Colonel.<br> M.P.s, guard the colonel.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Captain Ross.<br> - What the hell is this?<br> ColonelJessup, you have<br> the right to remain silent.<br> I'm being charged with a crime?<br> Is that what this is?<br> - I'm being charged with a crime?<br> - You have a right to consult a lawyer.<br> - This is funny. That's what this is.<br> - This lawyer may be appointed byyou.<br> I'm gonna rip the eyes out ofyour head<br> and piss in your dead skull!<br> You fucked with the wrong Marine!<br> ColonelJessup, doyou understand<br> these rights as I havejust read them?<br> You fucking people.<br> You have no idea<br> how to defend a nation.<br> All you did was weaken<br> a country today, Kaffee.<br> That's all you did.<br> You put people's lives in danger.<br> Sweet dreams, son.<br> Don't call me son.<br> I'm a lawyer and an officer<br> in the United States Navy...<br> and you're under arrest,<br> you son ofa bitch.<br> The witness is excused.<br> All rise.<br> Have the members reached a verdict?<br> We have, sir.<br> Lance Corporal Dawson<br> and Private First Class Downey.<br> On the charge ofmurder,<br> the members find the accused...<br> not guilty.<br> On the charge<br> ofconspiracy to commit murder...<br> the members find the accused<br> not guilty.<br> On the charge ofconduct<br> unbecoming a United States Marine...<br> the members find the accused<br> guilty as charged.<br> The accused are hereby sentenced<br> to time already served...<br> and you are ordered to be dishonorably<br> discharged from the Marine Corps.<br> This court-martial is adjourned.<br> All rise.<br> What does that mean?<br> What did that mean?<br> I don't understand. ColonelJessup<br> said he ordered the Code Red.<br> - I know.<br> - What did we do wrong?<br> - It's not that simple.<br> - We did nothing wrong!<br> Yeah, we did.<br> We were supposed to fight for people<br> who couldn't fight for themselves.<br> We were supposed<br> to fight forWillie.<br> I have to take these men<br> over to personnel for some paperwork.<br> You don't need to wear a patch<br> on your arm to have honor.<br> There's an officer on deck.<br> Airmen Cecil O'Malley<br> and Anthony Rodriguez--<br> What exactlywere these guys<br> gonna testify to?<br> Unless I'm mistaken, theywere both<br> gonna testify under oath...<br> that they had absolutely<br> no recollection ofanything.<br> - Strong witnesses.<br> - And handsome too, don'tyou think?<br> I'll seeyou around campus.<br> I gotta go arrest Kendrick.<br> Tell him I say hi.<br>
