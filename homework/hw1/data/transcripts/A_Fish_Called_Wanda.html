Good to be<br> here. England is a fine country!<br> Did she tell you what we need?<br> KEN GASPS<br> Something like that?<br> Something like that.<br> Hello, Wendy!<br> Had a good day?<br> I spend the morning trying to get<br> the waste disposal man to come,<br> had lunch with Marjorie Brooks who<br> spends the entire meal complaining,<br> then I come back here and Sandersons<br> have sent the wrong flowers.<br> Oh, no! Would you like some tea?<br> Yes!<br> I won the case. This is the first<br> moment I've had to myself all day!<br> Portia, how was the show? Awful.<br> I need a new horse. But you liked<br> Phantom. He's not fit for dog meat.<br> Can I change him?<br> It won't cost much.<br> Aren't you making the tea, Archie?<br> Let me do it. No, I'LL do it!<br> I won the case!<br> Oh! Now this is cracked!<br> They're worth about 100,000 each.<br> There are 135 of them -<br> that makes 13 million, my friends!<br> Dollars? Pounds, pet.<br> This is the big one, so...<br> OK.<br> Yeah.<br> Otto!<br> Yes?<br> OK.<br> What?<br> The plan!<br> Yeah, great! What was<br> the middle thing about the police?<br> We don't meet up at Heathrow<br> until Tuesday... Yeah!<br> I haven't finished yet!<br> Because the police will watch<br> the airports for 72 hours. I know.<br> I know.<br> Do you want m-me to g-get...<br> ..a b-big...c-car?<br> Yes, Ken. A limo, OK?<br> Put diplomatic plates on it.<br> What if he has to say something<br> during the break-in? No-one says<br> anything! It's OK. Ken's good.<br> So, next week, we won't have<br> to look for work!<br> And it won't have to look for us!<br> Oscar Wilde.<br> You really like animals, don't you?<br> What's the attraction?<br> Because you can t-trust them...<br> ..and they don't sh... Shit on you?<br> ..Shove off all the time.<br> Nietzsche said<br> they were God's second blunder.<br> Bye, Sis!<br> Well, you t-tell him from me...<br> that I c-could...<br> Bye, George!<br> Talk to Mom and tell her I said hi.<br> OK.<br> THEY WHISPER: Don't let him<br> touch you. We'll be together soon.<br> I'm sorry my brother's<br> so insensitive.<br> He's had a hard life.<br> Dad used to beat him up.<br> Good.<br> Move and you're dead!<br> ALARM RINGS<br> DOGS YAP<br> Look where you're going,<br> selfish pig!<br> People just think<br> they own the pavement!<br> I love robbing the English!<br> They're so polite.<br> Th-Th... What? The dog! 20 million<br> dollars and he's worried about<br> an insect! It's not an in-in...<br> Stammer's no better, is it?<br> Have you thought about surgery?<br> SIRENS WAIL<br> Ken...<br> Bye.<br> Let's split. Heathrow, Tuesday.<br> No celebrating! No celebrating?<br> See you in a couple of hours. OK.<br> To 20 million.<br> To a job well done! To us.<br> To the best brother and sister<br> team since... Romeo and Juliet?<br> Those cockney klutzes<br> bought our story! What MORONS!<br> I want you to know something. What?<br> Even if you were my brother,<br> I'd still want to fuck you.<br> Ooh... Mmm...<br> Make the call.<br> Un momento, carissima. No Italian!<br> Due insalate verde<br> con pepperoni! No!<br> E un linguini primavera!<br> No! Make the call, Otto!<br> Are you really Italian?<br> Assolutamente.<br> Otto means eight.<br> Say arrivederci a Giorgio.<br> Bye, George. Putta me through to...<br> Hello. Sorry to trouble you,<br> but I thought you'd like to know<br> that the Hatton Garden robbery was<br> pulled off by a Mr George Thomason.<br> He lives at...<br> ..flat 3, Kipling Mansions,<br> Murray Road, London W9.<br> Wanda?<br> POLICE SIRENS WAIL<br> KNOCKING<br> Open up!<br> George Francis Thomason?<br> Passport. Tickets. Money.<br> Asshole!<br> CAR CRASHES<br> We're rich, Wanda. Yep!<br> I bet you've had the most exciting<br> time of your life with me.<br> You said it!<br> HE GASPS<br> ..OK.<br> OK... I'm DISAPPOINTED!<br> Son of a bitch!<br> What do you have to do to make<br> people trust you?! Shut up!<br> People always take advantage of me!<br> Think! Where is it?<br> What are you doing? I'm thinking!<br> First I'll hang him up<br> with piano wire, then...<br> I'm going to talk to him.<br> Then I'll... Talk to who?<br> Talk to who?<br> In the course of installing these<br> windows, you knelt on broken glass<br> from the pane you'd dropped? Yes.<br> And your parents can confirm this?<br> And his aunt, Georgina Thomason.<br> KNOCK AT DOOR<br> Yes?<br> Excuse me, sir. There's<br> a young lady to see Thomason.<br> Anything else? That's everything<br> for the moment, thanks.<br> Ken will be in<br> with the fish food later.<br> Thanks.<br> OK.<br> Well? We'll be OK on the glass,<br> but what else will they have?<br> WOLF WHISTLES<br> Oh, George!<br> I can't believe this is happening!<br> That's not allowed, miss.<br> Are you OK? I'm all right.<br> I can't handle this.<br> I couldn't sleep. I was afraid<br> the police... Leave it out, OK?<br> Listen...<br> Listen!<br> You stayed at my place.<br> We slept late.<br> You made me breakfast.<br> What? What's he doing here?<br> He wanted to see you!<br> Who did it, George?<br> Do you want me to rub him out?<br> Anything. You name it.<br> I have friends making enquiries.<br> Good.<br> The jewels are very safe.<br> If I get sent down, it gets<br> handed back to cut my sentence.<br> To cut my sentence even more, I<br> could tell them who done it with me,<br> if I wasn't very happy<br> about everything.<br> What was the middle thing?<br> Piss off.<br> Do you want me to...? Now!<br> George...<br> ..you don't think...? Do you?<br> No!<br> No...<br> No!<br> OK. George? What?<br> (Are you sure the garage<br> is very safe?)<br> Trust me.<br> Thanks a lot. Bye. Have a good day.<br> He's not sure it was you. That's<br> something, I guess. What about you?<br> He believes me. That's why he can't<br> figure out about you. Figure out<br> what? If you turned him in, stupid!<br> Don't, er...<br> ..ever, ever, EVER<br> call me stupid, OK?<br> What?<br> That's George's lawyer. The other<br> guy must be the barrister.<br> So? Trust me.<br> Let me know if anything<br> unexpected turns up. Excuse me!<br> Don't I recognise you?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> Oh... But you are<br> a famous barrister, aren't you?<br> Um... Well, hardly!<br> Well, could I have<br> your autograph anyway?<br> Yes, certainly. Thanks.<br> I'm studying aspects of your legal<br> system. I'm American. Oh, really?<br> I've only just started. It's<br> fascinating! What brings you here?<br> It's a little embarrassing.<br> I have a friend.<br> Oh, I see. Well, there you are.<br> I knew it! You're Archie Leesh!<br> Leach. Right!<br> I saw you in court,<br> er...two weeks ago!<br> The casino break-in?<br> Oh, you were great!<br> Oh, I'm a big fan of yours! I love<br> the way you, er...cross-examine.<br> I really admire your work!<br> Thank you.<br> I'd better not... I don't suppose<br> you'd...? No, fine. Right.<br> Well...<br> Thank you for this.<br> I'll treasure it.<br> Au revoir.<br> You speak French, too.<br> What's going on? Whatever George<br> decides to do, he'll tell Leach.<br> Why?<br> Because he's his lawyer.<br> I know that.<br> So I'll get to know Leach. George<br> will tell him where the diamonds<br> are? That's what I'll find out.<br> You done well, my son!<br> Where we gonna hide it?<br> The fish tank.<br> Very good.<br> Don't tell Wanda anything. Otto<br> might get something out of her.<br> George.<br> You are going to g-get off?<br> Don't worry, Ken. We'll<br> fix it. Anything on Otto?<br> Not yet.<br> You watch him.<br> Ken?<br> OK.<br> The police have been all over it.<br> I'll change and then I'll help look.<br> Hello...K-Ken's p-p-p-pets!<br> Hey!<br> Wake up! Wake up, limey fish!<br> So, how are you going to get<br> friendly with this lawyer?<br> I don't know. I'll improvise.<br> Insects!<br> I thought Englishmen didn't like<br> women, the way they talk.<br> He's straight. Cute, too,<br> in a pompous sort of way.<br> You got the hots for him?<br> I'm not into necrophilia, thanks!<br> Is this hump-a-limey week? Otto<br> disapproves. Otto might get jealous.<br> E molto pericoloso, signorina.<br> Molto pericoloso...<br> Carissima... Speak it! Speak it!<br> Ossobuco milanese con piselli!<br> Melanzane...<br> Parmigiana con spinace!<br> Yes! Yes! Yes!<br> No! No! No! Si! Si! Si!<br> No! Not here!<br> Not here, Otto!<br> Um... Mozzarella? No, not here!<br> Parmigiano!<br> No!<br> Wanda?<br> Look what I've got, Wanda!<br> Treasure!<br> I thought it was the police.<br> Isn't it horrible about George?<br> I've a headache.<br> Will you buy me some aspirin?<br> DOOR SHUTS<br> What's that? Otto's in the bathroom.<br> Otto? We went to see George.<br> It was horrible!<br> Isn't it terrible about George?<br> When I find the bastard<br> who squealed!<br> I love that man!<br> What are you doing here?<br> Wanda was upset, Ken.<br> She needed to talk to family.<br> But sh-she just had a sh-shower!<br> I must speak to you.<br> WANDA SOBS<br> Are you OK? Yes. Thanks for coming.<br> Call me if you need me. OK.<br> Can't you think about her feelings?<br> Something f-funny is going on!<br> Oh, dear.<br> You don't even know why<br> you're excited. I saw the... Ken!<br> Isn't it time you faced up<br> to certain realities, Ken?<br> Come on!<br> You're attractive. You're smart.<br> You've wonderful bones, great eyes,<br> and you dress interestingly.<br> W-What...?<br> We could have fun together.<br> We'd be good for each other.<br> What do you say?<br> You must be j-jo... May I kiss you?<br> No, you fucking can't!<br> Just a peck! No tongue! No!<br> Ken!<br> OK, you didn't realise I was gay.<br> OK, look, I'm sorry.<br> I've handled this badly.<br> The physical side can wait.<br> You need time.<br> But will you think about it?<br> Oh, my God!<br> OH, MY GOD!<br> Ken, somebody just called!<br> They said that the police know that<br> the loot is in a garage in Fulham!<br> You and I have to go and move it<br> before the police find it! N-No!<br> It's all right! What?<br> Geor... Geor... George...<br> Mo... Mo... Moved...<br> George moved the loot?! Yes.<br> WHERE DID HE MOVE IT, KEN?<br> Ca...<br> Ca...<br> I don't know. There's a key.<br> It's in...<br> Don't tell me. It's better not to.<br> Oh, you know,<br> if it wasn't for George...<br> Otto...<br> ..tried to ki...kiss me.<br> I thought he might.<br> No, nothing. No marks at all.<br> But it is a safety deposit box key?<br> Yes. But it could be any one<br> of millions - hotels, banks, offices.<br> Thank you.<br> (Fuck!)<br> That's him. That's him, Inspector.<br> HE tried to murder my dogs!<br> Davidson!<br> A legal student wants to see me.<br> What time is Sir John due? 12.30.<br> Come in!<br> Hi. How nice to see you!<br> Am I interrupting? Absolutely not.<br> Really? No, really.<br> I'm delighted to see you.<br> So...this is the place, huh?<br> This is it. Very nice!<br> I was over at the courts<br> this morning. It's fascinating!<br> Everyone wears these. Do you?<br> Ridiculous!<br> Well, I only have a few minutes<br> before... I'm sorry.<br> But I'm all yours.<br> I just have a few questions.<br> I'm having a problem<br> understanding preliminary<br> criminal procedures. Good.<br> What exactly is the committal?<br> It's where the prosecution<br> presents prima facie evidence<br> that the accused has a case<br> to answer for trial.<br> Let's just take, for example,<br> my friend George Thomason.<br> When he goes for his committal<br> on Wednesday... Thomason?<br> Yes. George Thomason?<br> Yes. Do you know him?<br> I'm defending him!<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm his barrister. His lawyer.<br> That's so great!<br> That's so weird, though, isn't it?<br> I'm so happy<br> that you're defending him!<br> Thank you. He'll get off now!<br> Wow!<br> Well, I can watch you work now!<br> Please.<br> Amazing.<br> Anyway, at the committal,<br> George would then plead...<br> "Not Guilty". Really?<br> The evidence is circumstantial.<br> What about the identification?<br> An elderly lady.<br> I think they've got the wrong man.<br> You don't think he did it. No.<br> Let's just say for argument's sake<br> that you did think he did it.<br> If further evidence came to light,<br> for example. Right.<br> You'd advise him to plead guilty,<br> and turn over the jewels to cut his<br> sentence. He'd turn them over to?<br> To you?<br> Theoretically? Of course!<br> Well, um...<br> I'm so sorry,<br> I've forgotten your name.<br> Wanda.<br> Wanda. What a fool!<br> Well, Wanda, there are three...<br> Not Wanda Gershwitz?<br> Yes.<br> My God. What?<br> You're his alibi! I can't talk to<br> you! Why not? My dear young lady...<br> ..you're a defence witness!<br> You must leave. Why? It's not<br> ethical for me to talk to a witness!<br> Everyone does it in America.<br> Please leave,<br> or I may have to give up the case.<br> Please?<br> Oh, Archie...<br> I didn't come here today to talk<br> about boring criminal procedures.<br> Come on! You know!<br> You knew the minute<br> I walked in here!<br> I want you.<br> What?<br> BUZZER<br> Hello? 'Sir John is here.'<br> Show him in. Make love with me.<br> 'Pardon?' Nothing!<br> Take me to bed, Archie. No, sorry.<br> Bye, Uncle!<br> Hi!<br> DRAMATIC CLASSICAL MUSIC<br> He's pleading "Not Guilty",<br> so you're safe until the trial.<br> Leach doesn't think he did it.<br> Ken says there's<br> a safe deposit box key,<br> but only George knows where it is.<br> "Thank you, Wanda(!)"<br> What have YOU found out?<br> Not a lot. You realise he's<br> in court tomorrow? I know that!<br> So nothing, huh? Nichts!<br> Zip...<br> Diddly... Bubkas...<br> Niente!<br> It's too big! No, it isn't, Portia.<br> It's enormous! No, it isn't!<br> Please, Mother. Absolutely not!<br> I'm so miserable and you just<br> don't care!

You look great! I love<br> your hair! Time for a coffee?<br> No. Have you considered it, though?<br> Why did he give you this? "Eileen<br> Cody, 69, Basil Street"? Is it to<br> send her flowers? Do her shopping?<br> Rub her out?<br> He wants you to rub her out?<br> He's going to kill her!<br> LAUGHS MANIACALLY<br> Fuck off, or I'll kill YOU!<br> Limey fruits!<br> So the old lady's going to m-meet<br> with an accident, eh, K-Ken? Sssh!<br> What's so funny? Nothing. It's just<br> that wasting old ladies isn't nice!<br> It's better than...buggering people!<br> I bet you a pound<br> you don't kill her!<br> All right. All right.<br> I love watching your ass when you<br> walk. Is that beautiful or what?<br> Don't go near him! He's mine!<br> A pound says you won't kill her!<br> When could you look at it?<br> Thursday is hopeless.<br> My wife's going to the opera<br> Friday night. I'll look at it then.<br> Thanks, Archie.<br> Hi. I know we're not allowed<br> to talk. Give me a call. I can't!<br> Please.<br> I'm not allowed to speak.<br> You don't have to. I don't<br> want you for your conversation.<br> Look, I'd love to, but...<br> LOUD WAILS<br> What happened? Got a date Friday.<br> JOLLY WHISTLING<br> DOGS YAP<br> Look here. Do you mind<br> not making that terrible noise?<br> My dogs will be having their nap.<br> Nice doggy...<br> DOGS BARK AND GROWL<br> Otto, what are you doing?<br> Buddhist meditation. It focuses<br> aggression. The monks did it before<br> battle. What kind of buddhism is it?<br> HORN BLARES<br> Asshole!<br> It's an early Tantric meditation...<br> What is this? To get information I<br> might have to get friendly with him.<br> We're ready now at last.<br> Enjoy the opera, darling. Supper's<br> in the fridge, Archie. Be good.<br> What does "friendly" mean?<br> Cordial? Courteous?<br> Supportive? What?<br> I don't know.<br> Let's just see what happens.<br> So "friendly" might<br> include what? Penetration, say?<br> I don't need your jealousy now.<br> Jealousy? Yes! I'm just curious.<br> Me jealous of that fop?<br> What about my tits?<br> Does he get to handle them? Yes.<br> That's my forecast. Nuzzling?<br> is worth a little nuzzling.<br> Sucking? I thought you weren't<br> jealous! Jealousy is for the weak.<br> One thing, though -<br> touch his dick and he's dead!<br> Daddy didn't get the car serviced.<br> Aren't we going? Do shut up, Portia!<br> (Hurry up.)<br> Hi.<br> Do you despise me?<br> No, that's not a word<br> that leaps to mind(!)<br> Can I stay then?<br> Of course.<br> Look...Wanda...<br> I know. Your wife's coming back.<br> It's about what I said to you.<br> It IS all right for us to speak.<br> It is?<br> Provided we don't discuss the case.<br> Oh...<br> Oh, fine.<br> It's just that if anyone saw us<br> talking... But they won't.<br> Sorry if I seem...pompous.<br> Oh, you're the best, Archie.<br> No...<br> Not yet. I'm thirsty.<br> What shall I get you?<br> Whisky.<br> You are the sexiest, most beautiful<br> girl I have ever seen...<br> ..in my entire life.<br> Get me my drink.<br> Oh... Oh, Archie.<br> Oh, Archie!<br> So...<br> ..if George decides<br> to change his plea,<br> he'd tell you where the loot<br> was first, wouldn't he? Mmm?<br> Darling, we mustn't talk about the<br> trial. I just meant theoretically.<br> Kiss me there.<br> Oh, theoretically...<br> HE STARTS TO GIVE<br> A MUFFLED REPLY<br> What's wrong? It's wonderful!<br> Oh!<br> What's wrong? Oh, you're getting me<br> so hot! I need something to drink.<br> Something cold? Maybe in the<br> fridge? Champagne? My favourite!<br> Don't go away!<br> Je reviens!<br> What are you doing here?! Relax!<br> Get the fuck out! The moaning<br> worried me. I was faking it, stupid!<br> Don't call me stupid!<br> And I'm not jealous. Leave! OK!<br> What a nice place.<br> Don't touch his dick!<br> (His wife!)<br> For goodness sake, get off to bed!<br> Oh, God, there isn't any ice!<br> Champagne!<br> What's the matter?<br> What are you doing?<br> Champagne, dear.<br> To welcome you home.<br> Let me pour you a glass.<br> Whose is the car? Car?<br> Blocking the drive.<br> How was the opera?<br> Whose car is it?<br> Mine. A beauty, isn't it? Where<br> did I leave my drink, Archie? Ah!<br> Who is this? Don't you know?<br> How do you do, Mrs Leach?<br> I'm Harvey Manfrend...gendson.<br> I'm with the CIA. CIA?<br> That's right, ma'am.<br> I was telling your husband<br> before I had to go<br> to your beautiful bathroom....<br> ..we've a KGB defector<br> in a safe house near here.<br> We're debriefing him<br> as of now and we're just...<br> ..checking the houses in the area.<br> For what? For the KGB.<br> Is there any danger? No.<br> No, not now.<br> We, er, we just want<br> to keep everyone informed.<br> Thanks for the drink.<br> Sorry to have troubled you. Keep<br> everyone informed. There's no panic.<br> Isn't it a secret? You have no idea<br> how secret. Why are you telling us?<br> It's a smokescreen?<br> What? Double bluff.<br> You know nothing<br> about intelligence work, lady.<br> It's an XK Red 27 technique.<br> My father was in the Secret Service,<br> Mr Manfredgendson. I know that<br> you don't inform the general public<br> when debriefing the KGB in a safe<br> house. You don't, huh? Not unless<br> you're irretrievably stupid, no.<br> Don't call me stupid!<br> Why not?<br> Oh, you English are so superior,<br> aren't you?<br> Would you like to know<br> where you'd be without the U-S of A<br> to protect you? I'll tell you.<br> The smallest fucking province<br> in the Russian empire!<br> Don't call me stupid, thank me!<br> Thank you for popping in<br> and protecting us!<br> If it wasn't for us, you'd be<br> singing Deutschland Uber Alles!<br> My brother's covering for me!
