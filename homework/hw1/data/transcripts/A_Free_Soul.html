The world's full of girls.<br> Well, why'd Romeo<br> take on so much grief?<br> - You're amazing.<br> - Oh, yeah? A lot of nerve?<br> Mm-hm.

Don't hide.<br> Get out in the middle of life and if the wind<br> blows you over, pick yourself up again.<br> Make your own mistakes<br> and learn by them."<br> - And you know, I think he's right.<br> - I see.<br> Well...<br> ...now I've found out, haven't I?<br> Oh, dear, please.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - I know.<br> But I've got to do something about it.<br> Looking ahead without you<br> isn't much fun, is it?<br> Well, what can I do?<br> I'm going to do something.<br> You've shot it straight, Jan,<br> like you always do.
