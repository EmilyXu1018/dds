I need to... I really need<br> to be with my family.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm Jenny Wyatt in Millbrook,<br> and that was Tom Stall...<br> American hero, man of few words.<br> Well, I guess that's all<br> we're going to get.<br> Man, it's good to be home.<br> I hope there won't be<br> too much more of that.<br> Hey, Dad, they all just<br> want to interview you...<br> because of what you did.<br> You're a hero, Dad. Ha ha!<br> No, I'm not.<br> I just got lucky... very lucky.<br> This will all blow over...<br> as soon as they find<br> some other hot story.<br> Yeah. Maybe the Lydons will have<br> another two-headed cow.<br> You guys<br> aren't thinking big enough.<br> You could probably do<br> Larry King Live, Dad.<br> - That would be cool.<br> - Oh, you stop it. Stop it.<br> Look at this... more reporters.<br> Are they still there?<br> Yeah. Now there's some car<br> parked across the road.<br> - They're just sitting there.<br> - Huh.<br> - Does anyone want some tea?<br> - I'll take some, Mom.<br> Yes, please.<br> Unh. Aw, jeez.<br> Hey, Edie.<br> Hi. How are you?<br> - Did you go to the shop?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hello. Hey, Bill.<br> - Hi, honey.<br> - Hi, baby. How are you?<br> Oh, I'm all right.<br> What brings you by?<br> I just wanted to see<br> how you were doing.<br> Doing good. Business is great.<br> Just can't keep up.<br> Yeah, it's busy.<br> Oh, look, more reporters. Nice.<br> They don't look like reporters.<br> Grilled cheese is ready.<br> Got fries<br> and a strawberry shake.<br> Hello. Welcome to Stall's.<br> Would you gentlemen<br> like some coffee?<br> You're the hero.<br> Uh, I don't know, sir.<br> I was just...<br> Nah, you're the big hero.<br> You sure took care<br> of those two bad men.<br> I really don't like<br> talking about it, sir.<br> We're trying to get<br> back to normal here.<br> So, can I offer you gentlemen<br> some coffee?<br> Sure. Give me some coffee.<br> Make it black...<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Joey.<br> And... and your friends?<br> They don't drink coffee.<br> It doesn't agree<br> with them... Joey.<br> - Who's Joey?<br> - You are.<br> - My name's Tom, sir.<br> - Of course it is.<br> Mmm. That's good coffee.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> If I were to find coffee<br> as good in Philadelphia...<br> but you know that,<br> don't you, Tom?<br> Heh.<br> No, actually, I don't.<br> I've never been to Philadelphia.<br> Pennsylvania? Is that where<br> you gentlemen are from?<br> Yeah, like you don't know.<br> Sorry.<br> Did... Did we know each other?<br> You tell me.<br> No.<br> We don't know each other.<br> Come on, Joey. Cut the crap.<br> My name is Tom.<br> Joey Cusack.<br> Your name is Joey Cusack.<br> You're from Philly.<br> - Mm-hmm. OK. Whatever.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Excuse me, gentlemen, if you're<br> not going to order anything...<br> my husband and I<br> would appreciate it...<br> if you would be on your way.<br> We ate on the road.<br> It's all right.<br> It's OK.<br> We really are very busy here<br> today, as you can see.<br> Um, so if you gentlemen<br> aren't going to be eating...<br> I really should offer<br> your seats to paying customers.<br> Hmm.<br> Well...<br> now we're paying customers.<br> I can't take this.<br> It shouldn't be<br> any problem for you.<br> What is that supposed to mean?<br> Mr. Fogarty's<br> just making conversation here.<br> Well, whatever<br> you want to call it...<br> this conversation is over.<br> I think he wants us to leave,<br> Mr. Fogarty.<br> Do you know what he does...<br> when he don't like people,<br> Mr. Fogarty?<br> Yeah. I'm scared.<br> We should leave before he goes<br> all Dirty Harry on us.<br> I want to thank you<br> for the coffee, Joey.<br> It really is very good.<br> It's Tom. My name's Tom Stall.<br> Excuse me.<br> What are you doing?<br> Who are you calling?<br> Hi... Hi, Molly.<br> This is Edie Stall. Is he in?<br> I'm fine, thanks.<br> You're calling Sam?<br> Yes.<br> Is there a problem<br> with my driving, officer?<br> Can I see your license, sir?<br> Sure.<br> I thought I was under the limit.<br> Is there some problem<br> I should know about?<br> What's your business<br> in Millbrook, sir?<br> We're tourists.<br> And what business did you have<br> at Stall's Diner today?<br> We heard the coffee<br> was terrific.<br> Let me make something clear<br> to you and to Mr. Mulligan.<br> Uh-huh?<br> This is a nice town.<br> We have nice people here.<br> We take care of our nice people.<br> - Do you understand me?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Don't let me see you around<br> again.<br> You keep up the good work,<br> officer.<br> Charles Roarke, Philadelphia.<br> Indicted<br> on three counts of murder.<br> Frank Mulligan,<br> out of New York...<br> indicted on one count of murder.<br> Questioned in relation<br> to dozens of acts of violence...<br> that you don't want<br> to hear about.<br> Both men work for Carl Fogarty.<br> He's the fella with the eye.<br> He spent fifteen years in prison<br> on several counts of assault.<br> He's suspected<br> in half a dozen murders...<br> and more disappearances.<br> Tom, these guys are organized<br> crime from the east coast.<br> Now, they're the real thing.<br> They're bad men.<br> Jesus. Jesus, honey.<br> I have to ask you a question.<br> Are you in some kind<br> of witness protection plan?<br> - Sam.<br> - Some kind of what?<br> This is no laughing matter,<br> Edie.<br> Of course he's not, Sam.<br> I'd just like to hear<br> Tom say that.<br> OK. No. No,<br> I'm not in a witness program.<br> Those men just have<br> the wrong guy.<br> They must've seen me on TV,<br> and I guess, uh...<br> I reminded them<br> of this Johnny guy.<br> - Joey.<br> - J-Joey somebody.<br> I mean, good lord.<br> The idea of me...<br> I never honestly believed it,<br> but I had to ask.<br> I've done some research<br> on this, uh, Joey Cusack.<br> I didn't find anything.<br> But there is a Richie Cusack<br> in Philadelphia.<br> Apparently, he's the head...<br> of some kind of crime syndicate<br> in that city.<br> Men like this come to our town<br> and start harassing a citizen...<br> we have to take them seriously.<br> Sure.<br> All right. So, if you folks<br> see them coming around...<br> you let me know.<br> Will do.<br> I'm sorry, Sam. Do you want<br> a piece of pie or something?<br> Ah, no, thanks, Edie.<br> I'd love to,<br> but I've gotta get back to work.<br> Thank you. Thanks for coming.<br> Uh, Sam?

Are you serious?<br> I'll be there as soon as I can.<br> Shit.<br> Come on.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Come on.<br> Edie! Oh.<br> Ohh, fuck. Tom!<br> Tom. Tom, what's going on?<br> - l...<br> - Huh?<br> l... I don't know, baby.<br> Jesus.<br> What's going on?<br> I don't... I don't know. Ohh.<br> Let me call Sam, all right?<br> - No, don't.<br> - OK.<br> l... I don't even know...<br> l... I don't know<br> why I thought... l...<br> Mom?<br> It's OK, baby.<br> Yeah. Uh... ha ha. l...<br> l... l... I think<br> I'm losing my mind.<br> No, no, no. OK.<br> You're not losing your mind.<br> You've been through<br> some serious trauma, all right?<br> I'm here for you, baby.<br> We're all here for you.<br> It's all right.<br> It's gonna be OK.<br> Mom?<br> You haven't forgotten about<br> my new shoes, have you?<br> Gosh, no. It's my top priority<br> for the day.<br> How could I forget?<br> You all right?<br> Yeah, yeah. Hi... Hi, sweetie.<br> Honey,<br> just get ready for school.<br> I'll speak to you afterwards,<br> all right?<br> OK.<br> Come on.<br> Let's go shopping.<br> Hey.<br> Careful. It's loaded.<br> Why was Mom running<br> around the house with that?<br> What's going on, Dad?<br> False alarm.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> I am worried.<br> You're sweating.<br> You're soaked, Dad.<br> What kind of false alarm?<br> What did you mean,<br> you think you...<br> You think<br> you're losing your mind?<br> Some mob guys<br> showed up at the diner.<br> They saw me on TV, and they<br> came by to take a look at me.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I heard about that.<br> Uh, so...<br> They thought they knew me.<br> They thought...<br> I was somebody else.<br> Heh. That's weird.<br> Yeah. Weird.<br> And I guess, um...<br> Well, I guess...<br> they don't like this guy<br> they think you are.<br> Apparently not.<br> And, um, and I guess l...<br> I guess... I guess they want...<br> to kill this guy<br> they think you are?<br> See, that's... that's<br> the losing my mind part.<br> I mean, I have no reason<br> to think that.<br> It's just I was down at work,<br> and, you know...<br> suddenly I thought<br> maybe... maybe...<br> they'd come looking around.<br> You know?<br> And, uh...<br> And then you came running<br> back here to save us?<br> Yeah, something silly like that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What if you're right?<br> Then we deal with it.<br> OK.<br> Now, look what I just found.<br> It's my last pair in this style,<br> and it's exactly your size.<br> Just try these on.<br> They should fit like a dream.<br> How do they feel?<br> Good. Yeah, I think I like them.<br> I have a pair of these myself.<br> They look great<br> and they really last.<br> Really? OK. I'll take them.<br> And I needed a pair<br> for her as well.<br> Sarah?<br> Sarah?<br> - Uh, ma'am? The shoes...<br> - I have to find my daughter.<br> I can't let you leave the store<br> with the shoes.<br> OK, OK, OK. Sarah!<br> Sarah?<br> Sarah?<br> Sarah. Sarah.<br> Don't ever do that again, OK?<br> I'm sorry, Mommy.<br> But look.<br> They have the new Vespa dolls.<br> Nothin' to worry about,<br> Mrs. Stall.<br> I've been watching over her.<br> You stay the fuck away from<br> my family, you son of a bitch.<br> There's no need for that kind<br> of language, Mrs. Stall.<br> Listen to me.<br> I don't know what you want...<br> and I don't really care.<br> You should care about<br> what I want, Mrs. Stall...<br> because I want something<br> from your husband...<br> that might affect you,<br> might change your life.<br> My husband does not know you.<br> He wouldn't know you,<br> somebody like you.<br> Oh, he knows Carl Fogarty,<br> all right.<br> He knows me intimately.<br> See? This isn't<br> a completely dead eye.<br> It still works a bit.<br> The problem is, the only thing<br> I can see with it...<br> is Joey Cusack.<br> And it can see<br> right through him.<br> Right through your husband,<br> Edie.<br> See what's inside him,<br> what makes him tick.<br> He's still the same guy.<br> - No.<br> - He's still crazy fuckin' Joey.<br> And you know it, don't you?<br> I know that my husband is<br> Tom Stall. That's what I know.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, why don't you ask Tom<br> about his older brother Richie?<br> He doesn't...<br> Ask Tom about how he tried to<br> rip my eye out with barbed wire.<br> And ask him, Edie...<br> how come he's so good<br> at killing people?<br> If I see you within<br> five hundred feet of me...<br> or my children or my husband,<br> I'll have you arrested.<br> Heh heh heh heh.<br> Can I possibly make myself<br> any clearer than that?<br> No, no, Mrs. Stall, you can't.<br> I thank you for your time.<br> You have an enchanting daughter.<br> And, Mrs. Stall...<br> don't forget your shoes.<br> Heh heh heh heh.<br> So, how's your dad?<br> I don't know. A little weird.<br> Well, after<br> what he went through?<br> I mean,<br> actually killing someone?<br> I mean, that's enough<br> to freak anybody out.<br> Yeah. I guess.<br> So, your old man's<br> some kind of tough guy, huh?<br> What's he think<br> of his wimp son?<br> You think he'd take this shit?<br> You think he'd make jokes?<br> Go on, bitch.<br> Say something funny.<br> Bobby, leave him alone.<br> Shut up, skank.<br> Uh-oh. He's gettin' mad.<br> Jack, let's just<br> get out of here, OK?<br> Jack, he's an asshole.<br> You know that.<br> He doesn't mean shit.<br> Let's just go.<br> Let's just get out of here, OK?<br> Yeah, puss. Run away.<br> Goddamn, I bet your daddy<br> would be real ashamed by you.<br> Go ahead, bitch.<br> Say something funny.<br> Make me laugh.<br> - Uhh!<br> - Ohh!<br> Uhh!<br> OK, you motherfucker! Get<br> over there, you son of a bitch!<br> Ohh!<br> Come here. Are you laughin'?<br> Are you laughin' now...<br> you motherfucking<br> cocksucking piece of shit?<br> What the hell were you thinking?<br> - I wasn't thinking.<br> - Obviously not.<br> Bobby's been riding me<br> all year, Dad. He's a jerk.<br> He's a jerk?<br> Yeah. He's a jerk.<br> That's no excuse.<br> You stand up to him.<br> You don't put him<br> in the hospital!<br> Oh, big deal.<br> It's the best thing<br> anyone could've done to him.<br> Besides, I only got suspended.<br> It is a big deal!<br> His parents say<br> they might sue us.<br> There could be assault charges.<br> We can't afford that, Jack.<br> We don't have<br> that kind of money.<br> Oh, what?<br> Mom's not gonna take the case?<br> - Oh, whatever, Dad...<br> - Listen, smart mouth!<br> In this family, we do not solve<br> our problems by hitting people!<br> No, in this family,<br> we shoot them!<br> Ah!<br> Jack.<br> Honey, have you seen Jack?<br> What?<br> What's wrong, baby?<br> Fogarty and his men<br> followed us to the mall.<br> He what?<br> Call Sam.<br> Should... Should we call Sam?<br> We should call...<br> I already took care of it,<br> honey.<br> I already took care of it.<br> Went down to the courthouse...<br> got a restraining order.<br> A lot of good that'll do.<br> Well, it's something.<br> At least<br> we could have him arrested...<br> if he ever<br> comes around here again.<br> You're right.<br> But I have to tell you<br> something.<br> What?<br> This man Fogarty<br> really believes...<br> that you're this Joey Cusack.<br> I mean, the things that<br> he told me this afternoon...<br> - What things?<br> - Things. Just bullshit.<br> But he's, uh,<br> he's sure that it's you.<br> And we have to convince him<br> that it's not.<br> Well, I don't think he's<br> interested in examining my DNA.<br> Get off our property.<br> We'll go, Joey.<br> We just want you<br> to come with us.<br> Come back to Philly,<br> see some people.<br> I told you, I have never been<br> to Philadelphia.<br> Heh. You almost believe<br> your own crap, don't you?<br> You know, you're trying so hard<br> to be this other guy.<br> It's painful to watch.<br> - Charlie.<br> - Hey.<br> Look what we found.<br> Come on.<br> Yeah? Ha ha ha.<br> - Mom!<br> - Jack!<br> - No! Edie! Edie!<br> - Mom!<br> - Edie! No! No!<br> - Jack!<br> Let go, you son of a bitch!<br> Come here.<br> Wait.<br> Mom.<br> Don't make us hurt the kid,<br> Joey.<br> We just want you to come<br> for a little trip with us...<br> down Memory Lane.<br> Put the popgun down.<br> Come over and talk to us.<br> Baby, wait.<br> Edie...

Do it.<br> Put the gun down.<br> Put it down, Joey.<br> Come closer.<br> A little further.<br> Come on.<br> Go back to the house, Jack.<br> Go on.<br> You see how cozy it can be<br> when you decide to play nice?<br> Now, come on, Joey.<br> Get in the car.<br> You won't need your toothbrush.<br> We'll take care of everything.<br> I think it'd be better<br> if you'd just leave now.<br> Joey.<br> Come on, Joey, let's go.<br> Ahh!<br> - Uhh!<br> - Uhh! Uhh!<br> Ohh! Ohh!<br> Uhh!<br> Tom!<br> Fuck.<br> Mommy, what's wrong?<br> It's OK.<br> You got anything to say<br> before I blow your brains out...<br> you miserable prick?<br> I should've killed you<br> back in Philly.<br> Yeah, Joey.<br> You should have.<br> Uhh! Uhh.<br> Edie.<br> Honey, are you OK?<br> Tell me the truth.<br> The truth?<br> Please.<br> You can do that, can't you?<br> You can do that, can't you?<br> Please?<br> What do you think you heard?<br> It's not what I heard.<br> It's what I saw.<br> I saw Joey.<br> I saw you turn into Joey<br> right before my eyes.<br> I saw a killer...<br> the one Fogarty warned me about.<br> You did kill men<br> back in Philly, didn't you?<br> Did you do it for money...<br> or did you do it<br> because you enjoyed it?<br> Joey did, both. I didn't...<br> Tom Stall didn't.<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, God, it's really happening.<br> Oh.<br> What are you, like, some<br> multiple personality schizoid?<br> It's like flipping a switch<br> back and forth for you?<br> I never expected<br> to see Joey again.<br> Oh, yeah. Joey.<br> What, was he in hiding?<br> Was he dead?<br> I thought he was.<br> I thought I killed Joey Cusack.<br> I went out to the desert,<br> and I killed him.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I spent three years<br> becoming Tom Stall.<br> Edie, you have to know this.<br> I wasn't really born again<br> until I met you.<br> I was nothing.<br> I don't believe you.<br> I can't believe<br> this is happening.<br> I can't believe<br> this is happening.<br> I can't believe<br> this is fucking happening!<br> You didn't grow up in Portland.<br> And you never talk about<br> your adopted parents...<br> because you don't have any!<br> And our name.<br> Jesus Christ, my name.<br> Jack's name. Sarah's name?<br> Stall? Tom Stall?<br> Did you just make that up?<br> Where did that name come from?<br> I mean...<br> it was available.<br> Yeah.<br> I guess I was available, too.<br> Hey, Jack.<br> What am I supposed<br> to call you now?<br> You're supposed to call me Dad.<br> That's what I am... your dad.<br> Are you really?<br> So, you're some kind of<br> closet mobster dad?<br> I mean, if I go rob<br> Millikan's Drug Store...<br> will you ground me if I don't<br> give you a piece of the action?<br> What, Dad? You tell me.<br> Please, son. Don't.<br> If I talk to Sam about you,<br> will you have me whacked?<br> Jack.<br> Tom?<br> Hey, Sam.
