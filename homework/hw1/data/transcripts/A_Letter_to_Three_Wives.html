                        [Woman Narrating] To begin with, all<br> the incidents and characters in this story...<br> might be fictitious...<br> and any resemblance<br> to you or me...<br> might be purely coincidental.<br> The name of the town<br> isn't important.<br> It's the one that's just<br> 28 minutes from the big city...<br> 23 if you catch<br> the Morning Express.<br> It's on a river, and it's got houses<br> and stores and churches...<br> and a Main Street.<br> Nothing fancy<br> like Broadway or Market.<br> Just plain Main.<br> Drugs, dry goods, shoes...<br> those horrible little chain stores<br> that breed like rabbits.<br> Also a street for the upper,<br> the exclusive of the town...<br> where the country-club set live<br> when they're not at the country club.<br> This is the first Saturday in May...<br> and tonight the first dinner dance<br> of the country-club season.<br> Well, anyway, this house belongs to<br> Brad and Deborah Bishop...<br> two of my dearest friends.<br> Brad bought this house<br> before he went to war.<br> It was Brad who gave me<br> my first black eye and...<br> and my first kiss.<br> Well, when he came home from the war,<br> he came home with a wife... Deborah.<br> Thomasino said to tell you<br> he found room for your briefcase in the bag.<br> Good for Thomasino.<br> - Why'd you have him pack a bag?<br> - Because I know these Saturday conferences.<br> A bit like Saturday poker games...<br> don't plan on doing anything Sunday.<br> It's strange, your not letting me know<br> when you plan to be away overnight.<br> This is just in case, darling.<br> There's no telling how late it'll be.<br> And I like my own pajamas between me<br> and the sheets in a Turkish bath.<br> You'll phone this afternoon,<br> though, either way, won't you?<br> And leave word,<br> even if I'm not here?<br> Just where might you be<br> when I call if not here?<br> First Saturday in May, remember?<br> The Settlement House Picnic.<br> That's right. The Women's Club thing.<br> Like it?<br> Anything to do with kids.<br> You know that.<br> What are you wearing tonight?<br> I've got the one<br> you liked so much in Vogue.<br> - But if you're staying in town...<br> - What color?<br> Black, like you said.<br> Brad, I don't want to go without you.<br> Darling, it's the first<br> dinner dance of the season.<br> - If I only knew you were gonna be there.<br> - I will be if I can...<br> and if I can't, why should<br> that throw you into a panic?<br> What are you afraid of,<br> anyway, Deborah?<br> - Good morning, Thomasino.<br> - Morning, Mr. Bishop.<br> I'm not in a panic.<br> Well, then?<br> It's just that suddenly the thought<br> of going to that dance tonight without you...<br> - Brad?<br> - Hmm?<br> Addie Ross... she used to be<br> sort of your ideal, wasn't she?<br> Now how did Addie<br> get into this conversation?<br> I never knew you read Vogue.<br> I never thought men bothered much about it.<br> What's Vogue got to do with it? I told you<br> I picked it up on the train coming home one night.<br> - Some woman had left it behind.<br> - Some woman.<br> Yes, some woman. I thumbed through it and<br> saw a dress I thought would look smart on you.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> Nothing, I guess.<br> Nothing at all.<br> - I should hope not.<br> - Well, I've gotta pick up Rita.<br> - You'll phone about tonight, won't you?<br> - I told you I would.<br> It just so happens<br> that the dress I bought...<br> that you picked out of Vogue that some<br> woman happened to leave on the train...<br> is exactly the dress that Addie Ross<br> wore to the concert two weeks ago!<br> Hot toast, Mr. Bishop.<br> [Woman Narrating] She won't stay mad<br> at him long. She's too much in love.<br> Pretty soon,<br> she'll be full of self-reproach.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Women are so silly.<br> Now, this is that street where people<br> on the way up and on the way down...<br> live alongside each other for awhile.<br> Rita and George Phipps<br> are on their way up...<br> that is, if Rita has her way.<br> And that's the only way<br> she'll have any part of, thank you.<br> There she is now.<br> Ready, waiting. That's Rita.<br> Hi. You're late.<br> I won't be a minute.<br> Just one last look at the twins<br> and I've gotta give Sadie her check.<br> On behalf of the underprivileged<br> children of this town...<br> I'd like to thank you<br> over-privileged ladies...<br> for sharing your<br> excess privileges with us.<br> There's something odd-looking<br> about you today, George.<br> Just that usual two-headed<br> schoolteacher look.<br> You're all dressed up. Saturday,<br> no school, and you're all dressed up.<br> Just my little old blue serge.<br> First Saturday of trout season. Brad says<br> ever since you were big enough lift a fish...<br> Shh. Listen closely.<br> Can you hear the grateful murmur of the trout<br> as they whisper in the brooks and streams?<br> This is what they whisper:<br> "Phipps will not fish today."<br> Mm. You're cute. But why?<br> Because I've got<br> something better to do.<br> Have a nice day.<br> Debby, darling, we'll have to stop station.<br> I've just got to get my copy off on the 8:42.<br> Do you mind?<br> What's George<br> being so mysterious about?<br> I wouldn't know.<br> It seems we're not talking.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - Oh, it's just one of those things.<br> It'll be all right.<br> Why? Was he acting strangely?<br> Mm. Not exactly. Well, it's only he's<br> not going fishing and being all dressed up.<br> All dressed up?<br> Why, so he is. His blue suit.<br> On Saturday of all things.<br> And no fishing. Hmm.<br> - [Click]<br> - The radio hasn't been fixed yet.<br> Oh. And they've just<br> gone on the air.<br> Oh, well. Save myself listening<br> to the murder of my little brainchild.<br> Rita, why on earth do you do it?<br> Five of those radio programs every week.<br> Up until dawn<br> almost every night.<br> Because each week<br> I receive in return 100 pieces...<br> of what Addie Ross calls<br> "the most restful shade of green in the world."<br> Unquote. Addie again.<br> Why is it that sooner or later,<br> no matter what we talk about...<br> we wind up talking<br> about Addie Ross?<br> [Woman Narrating] Maybe it's because<br> if you girls didn't talk about me...<br> you just wouldn't talk at all.<br> [Giggles]<br> That's right. I'm Addie.<br> I'm the one theyjust<br> can't help talking about.<br> My very dearest friends too.<br> You know, I wonder if she knows<br> how much we do talk about her.<br> And what we say<br> and how we feel about her.<br> [Addie Narrating]<br> I know. Believe me, I do.<br> And it doesn't matter.<br> It doesn't matter nearly as much<br> as what all of you don't know... yet.<br> [Yelling, Excited Chattering]<br> - Morning, Mrs. Hollingsway.<br> - Haven't the others gotten here yet?<br> No. You're the very first,<br> the early bird.<br> - I've taken it upon myself<br> to get the children aboard.<br> - Oh. Good idea, Miss Hawkins.<br> So that when the other ladies arrive,<br> we'll be all ready to go.<br> Fine. If they'll only get here.<br> Oh, I'm sorry we're late.<br> Rita had to go by the station.<br> Oh, sure.<br> See anyone there you know?<br> - Just a husband of mine running like mad. Why?<br> - Nobody else?<br> Where's Addie? Weren't you<br> supposed to pick her up?<br> Nothing's happened to her,<br> I hope.<br> Addie Ross left town this morning.<br> Left town?<br> Well, what do you mean, "left town"?<br> She certainly could've told someone,<br> at least phoned.<br> - She's left for good.<br> - Then it must've been something<br> sudden, some emergency.<br> What makes you so sure it's for good?<br> How do you know?<br> Well, the doorman told me<br> she subleased her apartment last week...<br> and yesterday she sold her car.<br> So much for<br> your sudden emergency.<br> If that isn't just like her. Why do you suppose<br> she had to keep it such a big secret?<br> Who knows why Addie does<br> or doesn't do anything?<br> [Whistles]<br> I've got a letter for the Mesdames Bishop,<br> Hollingsway and Phipps.<br> From the dear departed, I'll bet.<br> Addie's so tactful.<br> She even puts us in alphabetical order.<br> - Open it up.<br> - No, let's wait.<br> - For what?<br> - Till we get back. Knowing Addie...<br> I mean, why let her spoil our day?<br> Not my day. Addie Ross never<br> saw the day she could spoil my day.<br> Did I put enough days into that?<br> [Addie's Voice]<br> Dearest Debby, Lora Mae and Rita.<br> As you know by now, you'll have to<br> carry on without me from here.<br> It isn't easy to<br> leave a town like our town...<br> to tear myself away from you three dear,<br> dear friends who have meant so much to me.<br> And so I consider myself<br> extremely lucky...<br> to be able to take with me<br> a sort of memento.<br> Something to remind me always<br> of the town that was my home...<br> and of my three<br> very dearest friends...<br> whom I want never to forget.<br> And I won't.<br> You see, girls, I've run off with one<br> of your husbands. Addie.<br> If that's her idea of a joke,<br> it's in extremely poor taste.<br> If I ever catch up<br> with that character, I'll...<br> Ladies, may I suggest...<br> The captain seems to think...<br> Well, he's been rude about it.<br> [Steam Whistle Blows]<br> [Ship's Bell Ringing]<br> [Excited Chattering,<br> Yelling Continues]<br> [Ship's Motor Puttering]<br> [Steam Whistle Blows]<br> [Yelling, Excited Chattering]<br> Well, looks like Addie has crowned<br> one of us Queen of the May.<br> I think it's laughable.<br> - Okay. Laugh.<br> - Ha.<br> Deborah didn't happen to mention<br> why Brad had to go to the city, did she?<br> He hasn't missed a Saturday on that golf<br> course since they got the snow off the greens.<br> All right, kids.<br> Get 'em while they're red hot.<br> It's gonna be a real restful day.<br> Nothing to think about except<br> the picnic and the weenie roast...<br> and coming home.<br> Oh, that. Kathleen's going<br> to read us a fairy story.<br> Fairy story? My favorite kind.<br> I grew up on them.<br> Only I wrote my own.<br> May I start now, Mrs. Bishop?<br> If you're ready, Kathleen.<br> Of course.<br> - "Once..."<br> - Once.<br> "Once upon a time,<br> there lived a very poor girl...<br> "who was very beautiful.<br> She was so beautiful..."<br> [Addie's Voice]<br> Do you remember your first night in town?<br> You and Brad,<br> fresh out of the navy.<br> That was a first Saturday<br> in May too.<br> - It it Brad?<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> - Is it Brad?<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> - Is it Brad?<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> Ohhh.<br> Here now, what's this?<br> Conduct unbecoming and officer and a lady.<br> I'm such an unholy mess!<br> - How?<br> - This!<br> - A little too kinky maybe?<br> - She must've set it with cement.<br> Mm. Here try this. It'll take<br> the kink out of a watch spring.<br> I'm no raving beauty,<br> heaven knows...<br> but I did so wanna look<br> my miserable best tonight.<br> The very first time we've gone out together<br> all dressed up like civilians.<br> And you would be<br> the one man in the world...<br> that looks even better out<br> of uniform than in.<br> Got the jumps, kid?<br> It's been quite a day, that's all.<br> Quite a change.<br> Out of the navy, out of uniform.<br> New home, new town, new friends.<br> Oh, I told that blasted girl<br> I wanted to comb it out soft!<br> It's making me look even more<br> like a farmhand than I feel.<br> - Easy does it.<br> - Meeting your friends for the first time.<br> You wouldn't want them<br> to see me like this.<br> I should hope not.<br> You be sure to put on a dress.<br> - Hey! My tie.<br> - You can tie it again.<br> [Door Buzzer]<br> There they are.<br> - Brad, about my dress... you might not like it.<br> - If you're in it, I'll love it.<br> It's my only one and years old. Remember<br> there wasn't time today to get a new one...<br> and even years ago,<br> it wasn't exactly the last word.<br> That was the last word.<br> Hurry up.<br> Which ones are they?<br> I wanna have it right.<br> Rita and George Phipps.<br> We all grew up together.<br> He teaches at the high school,<br> they have twins...<br> and she just got a job<br> writing for the radio.<br> Did you like her very much...<br> when you grew up together, I mean.<br> Rita and George were engaged<br> at the age of five by swapping beetles.<br> - She was never my type.<br> - What is your type?<br> Fat, squat, little brunettes<br> with mustaches.<br> Get going... and take another whack<br> at that hair.<br> [Sighs]<br> The original will be down<br> in person directly.<br> - Brad! Hi, darling.<br> - Hello, Rita.<br> - George.<br> - Hello, Brad. You look fine.<br> - I feel fine.<br> - Good to see you.<br> What's this I hear about twins?<br> You look like a fugitive from a junior prom.<br> Oh, not next to that, I don't.<br> - Brad, she's adorable.<br> - My personal share of navy surplus.<br> She certainly doesn't look<br> as if she grew up on a farm.<br> Darling, I'm sure she took the hay out of<br> her mouth while she was being photographed.<br> - [Chuckles]<br> - Don't be funny, dear.<br> What I meant was that<br> from Brad's letter, I imagined all sorts of...<br> Well, anyway, just where on Fifth Avenue<br> was this farm she came from?<br> It's like music to hear<br> you two pick at each other.<br> - [Laughs]<br> - Oh, we've declared an armistice for tonight...<br> out of respect<br> for your battle fatigue.<br> Fine. Well, here it is again.<br> The first Saturday night in May.<br> And here we are.<br> You two, Porter and Lora Mae.<br> We'll all be together again,<br> just the way it used to be.<br> Uh, well, not exactly as it used to be.<br> It seems there's been a change<br> in one of the characters.<br> Yeah. Not exactly<br> the same old six.<br> Tell me, how is Addie?<br> Rita and George, Deborah.<br> Debby, Rita and George Phipps.<br> They were with me the day<br> I swallowed my first worm...<br> and I hope will be there<br> when I swallow my last.<br> That's the most disgusting<br> introduction I ever heard.<br> - Hello, Deborah. Welcome.<br> - Thank you.<br> - How do you do, Deborah?<br> - How do you do?<br> Well, the occasion calls for a drink...<br> a quick one, because we're late.<br> - Uh, we've been admiring your photograph.<br> - Yes.<br> It's a very flattering one.<br> Maybe it's the uniform.<br> For some reason or other, I always seem<br> to be wearing a full beard in photographs.<br> - You know, even in snapshots as a child, l...<br> - Give me a hand, George.<br> Uh, excuse me.<br> I don't think it's particularly flattering.<br> Nice of you to say so, but it is.<br> Well, here's to Deb. And here's to us<br> and many happy returns of this day.<br> - I'll drink to that.<br> - Amen.<br> Ah. Now, if I can remember<br> my way to the club...<br> Oh, before we go, I have to call<br> the house and see if the sitter's showed up.<br> - It's Sadie's night out.<br> - Well, why not call from upstairs?<br> I have to get my bag anyway.<br> Good idea.<br> Now, don't make a tribal ceremony<br> out of it, girls. We're late now.<br> - Huh huh.<br> - George and I will get the car and wait outside.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Remember, we'll be waiting outside.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Ready, George?<br> Mm? Oh.<br> - Oh, they finally put a traffic light at that dip<br> on Orchard Avenue.<br> - Yeah?<br> The Mayor cracked<br> his upper plate there last Christmas.<br> [Laughs]<br> All the doors and windows are locked.<br> Don't worry about them.<br> What?<br> Certainly not. They're old enough<br> to do that by themselves.<br> We'll be at the country club.<br> Fine. Good night.<br> Well...<br> - Something wrong?<br> - No.<br> - [Car Horn Honking]<br> - The bugle sounds.<br> I think I've got a sick headache<br> and can't go.<br> Then there is something wrong.<br> Me. I'm wrong.<br> What do you mean? How?<br> Every which way.<br> For Brad. For his friends.<br> You, your husband,<br> the others I haven't met yet.<br> The country club.<br> The town.<br> I'm scared.<br> I'm so scared, I'm sick.<br> [Horn Honking Repeatedly]<br> Isn't there a nice baseball game or something<br> you children can listen to on the radio?<br> - What's going on up there?<br> - I'm, uh...<br> I'm having a little slip trouble.<br> - Oh. Hurry it up.!<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Looks like somebody<br> had a lot of martinis.<br> I did.<br> What are you so scared of?<br> It's worst than my first night<br> in the WAVES.<br> And I'd never been away from home<br> before up until then.<br> But we were all in the same spot.<br> Everything was happening<br> to all of us for the first time.<br> Mm. And here you're<br> the only new girl, is that it?<br> Look. You're Brad's wife<br> and our friend.<br> We want you here<br> and we've waited for you.<br> Now, why shouldn't that make you feel<br> safe and secure instead of being scared?<br> You can't be safe and secure<br> by just telling yourself to feel it.<br> Unless, maybe, you've got twins<br> and a job of your own...<br> and grown up with your husband<br> and friends.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean that.<br> Blame it on the martinis.<br> You know, counting ice water...<br> we could squeeze two more<br> out of this shaker.<br> Oh, no. No.<br> I've had more tonight than all the rest<br> of my life put together.<br> What was it like at home?<br> Or should I mind my own business?<br> Ever read in the picture magazines<br> about Farmer So-and-so...<br> and his model farm,<br> kitchen and life?<br> Well, it wasn't us<br> or anybody we knew.<br> Papa'd just get through<br> paying for the thresher...<br> in time to start paying<br> on the new separator.<br> Till I was 13, a bus took me three miles<br> that way to grammar school.<br> Till I was 17, another bus took me<br> And after that, I stayed home.<br> Till one day I took a bus<br> to join the navy<br> and see the world.<br> And meet Brad "Bripaship."<br> Fall in love<br> and marry Brad "Bripaship."<br> Why not?<br> "Why not?" I said to myself. I was quite a girl<br> in the navy. Head of my class. Hooray for me.<br> And pretty cute in that uniform.<br> That uniform...<br> it's the great "leveleller."<br> You couldn't tell me<br> from Vassar or Smith or Long Island.<br> That was the girl in the picture on the piano.<br> That isn't me. This is me.<br> What do you people talk about?<br> Years of growing up together. Thousands<br> of first names and private memories.<br> How do I fit in? Running a house,<br> making friends, filling the day.<br> Mrs. Bradbury Bishop.<br> "What's she like?"<br> "Fun to be with, smart as a whip,<br> pretty too.<br> No wonder Brad Bishop married her,<br> the lucky stiff."<br> Rita, look at me.<br> Look at my mail-order dress...<br> that's four years old<br> and awful even then.<br> What am I gonna do?<br> As if that really mattered.<br> You must think we're<br> an awful bunch of snobs.<br> Aren't you underestimating us<br> a little bit and Brad even more?<br> You know, it's just possible<br> he knew what he wanted and you had it.<br> And if you had it, you still got it.<br> [Weepy Muttering]<br> I can't hear you. Sit up.<br> I said, "Thank you<br> for the kind words."<br> You're welcome.<br> Now, about the dress.<br> - Haven't you anything else?<br> - Only uniforms.<br> Oh. Well, stand up.<br> - [Sighs] The flowers must go.<br> - Flowers must go.<br> Have you any scissors?<br> - Scissors?<br> - Oh.<br> I'll get the ones on the sleeves.<br> You tackle the big one in the middle.<br> - Careful now.<br> - Careful now.<br> [Gasps]<br> Now look what I did!<br> Oh. You don't want<br> a bare midriff, do you?<br> Tsk. Well, back goes the flower.<br> Sit down. Have you<br> got any safety pins?<br> - Bottom drawer.<br> - Oh.<br> ##[Bossa Nova Big Band]<br> - More wine?<br> - Thank you. No.<br> Not much at dancing.<br> It makes me nervous.<br> - Does it?<br> - Whatever I do, I wanna do well.<br> Can't do a thing well,<br> leave it alone, I always say.<br> I think I will have<br> a little more wine, thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Especially the rumba. Gotta have Spanish blood<br> or something, like my wife.<br> Comes from an old Spanish family<br> named Finney.<br> In many South American countries...<br> there are many very distinguished families<br> with Irish names.<br> ##[New Song Begins]<br> Lora Mae looks good with Brad.<br> Looks like class. But it's him, not her.<br> If she was dancin' with a tramp,<br> she'd look like a tramp.<br> Got no class of her own.<br> I like class.<br> - You like class?<br> - Oh, very much.<br> You hit the jackpot.<br> Brad Bishop... class plus money.<br> Yes, sir. The jackpot and you hit it.<br> Count 'em on the fingers of one hand<br> in this town... throw away some fingers even.<br> There's... There's Brad and who else?<br> Yeah. There's Addie.<br> Addie? Addie who?<br> Ross. Addie Ross.<br> - Funny. People always figured<br> Brad and Addie would...<br> - Brad and Addie what?<br> The samba can be danced properly<br> only on the side of a hill on ice.<br> Alibi. He was afraid<br> of getting wrinkles in his new suit.<br> Oh, my first new party dress<br> in years...<br> thanks to my dear wife<br> and her millions of listeners...<br> including the armed forces overseas.<br> Shall we drink to them all...<br> one by one?<br> - How about some coffee?<br> - George. I think your tuxedo has got class, George.<br> - We thank you.<br> - Funny thing for a wife<br> to give her husband a tuxedo.<br> - An even funnier thing<br> for a husband to give his wife.<br> - [Snickers]<br> Come on, Deborah.<br> While the coffee's nice and hot.<br> - You're so funny, George.<br> - I still don't think a woman<br> oughta buy clothes for a man.<br> - It's about time they start.<br> - Contrary to nature.<br> Oh, tell us about nature, Porter.<br> It's a man's world, yeah.<br> See something you want,<br> go after it and get it. That's nature.<br> It's why we're made strong<br> and women weak.<br> Strong conqueror provides for the weak.<br> That's what a man's for.<br> Teach our kids more of that,<br> there'll be more men.<br> And more war.<br> Leave my kids out.<br> - [Music Ends]<br> - But those standards don't apply to me, Porter...<br> because in this man's world,<br> I'm not a man.<br> - I'm a schoolteacher.<br> - [Slurring] The dance is over.<br> [Porter]<br> I knew we'd get around to that.<br> All right.<br> Schoolteachers oughta get paid more.<br> And what happens if they're not?<br> How does a schoolteacher<br> provide for the weak?<br> How does he pay the rent<br> with the plays and poems of Shakespeare?<br> Have you been shooting off<br> your big mouth again?<br> You just shut up till<br> it's time to dance again.<br> Let me tell you about nature<br> making men strong.<br> Einstein couldn't kick a football<br> across this dance floor...<br> but he changed<br> the shape of the universe.<br> Now, take it easy, everybody.<br> This is getting a little out of hand.<br> You never know what he'll come up with<br> when he starts knocking on that brandy bottle.<br> You shut up.<br> You just shut up.<br> Isn't it fun, Deborah?<br> We're all pals. You know, buddies.<br> Just one big happy family.<br> [Wolf's Whistle]<br> - [George] Why, Brad.!<br> - Not me, but it's a good idea.<br> With the compliments<br> of Mrs. Addie Ross.<br> Oh, Porter, you were saying<br> something about her and Brad.<br> Addie.<br> - John, where is Mrs. Ross?<br> - I don't believe she's arrived yet, Mr. Bishop.<br> That's Addie for you.<br> Always the right thing at the right time.<br> - Thoughtful and generous.<br> - Generous to a fault.<br> To a fault. That's Addie.<br> Who is Mr. Ross?<br> Mr. Ross took a powder<br> about five years ago.<br> No such thing.<br> She gave him the heave-ho.<br> He went out for a paper one night<br> and never came back.<br> Porter says Addie Ross<br> has got class.<br> And he knows class<br> like I know navigation.<br> You stick to your guns, Porter.<br> It shows a healthy instinct.<br> You may call it "class,"<br> but what Addie has is taste.<br> I can buy taste.<br> Addie's got class.<br> [George]<br> Taste and discrimination.<br> Women usually get them<br> out of magazines...<br> but they're part of<br> Addie's natural equipment.<br> Also fog lights,<br> white sidewalls and a heater.<br> Isn't it fun, Deborah,<br> when the boys all agree?<br> On Addie Ross<br> and George Washington... nobody else.<br> [Chuckles] You girls put your noses back<br> into joint. I wanna propose a toast.<br> First half of the glass to Deborah.<br> Welcome home, darling.<br> - I'll drink to that.<br> - Amen!<br> And the rest to our absentee hostess, Addie.<br> - Perfect.<br> - To Addie.<br> ##[Waltz Begins]<br> - Let's show 'em a flash of old Vienna.<br> - Darling, if you don't mind...<br> - Before the floor gets crowded.<br> - I don't think I should.<br> Oh-ho.<br> Let's get into this, George. Something<br> tells me this is going to be quite a waltz.<br> - [Gulps] Brad.<br> - Having fun?<br> - Brad, listen.<br> - Hold on, baby.<br> - Once more.<br> - No!<br> Deborah, what on earth<br> have you done to yourself?<br> Brad, let me handle this.<br> Uh, pardon my fingers.<br> - Here. Drink this.<br> - What is it?<br> A new inner tube.<br> There you are. I think<br> that'll be all right.<br> - Thank you, Miss Jenkins.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Rita, will you take me home?<br> You've got the idea everybody out there is<br> watching that door waiting for you to come out.<br> - Maybe not, but Brad is.<br> - Then it's because he's worried about you.<br> It's because he's ashamed!<br> In front of his friends...<br> ugly and pinned up,<br> drunk and sick.<br> Oh, I wanted so much to be what he wanted,<br> to do what was right, like...<br> like Addie Ross,<br> the right thing at the right time.<br> But I didn't, I couldn't.<br> L-I'm humiliated.<br> What happened tonight could have happened<br> to anyone. Don't you realize that?<br> Then take my word for it.<br> Come on.<br> Why, there's Brad.<br> Well.<br> [Chuckles]<br> I see Addie got here after all.<br> - [Addie's Voice] Is is Brad?<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> - Is is Brad?<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> - Is is Brad?<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> - [Kathleen Reading, Indistinct]<br> - [Distorted Voice] Is it Brad?<br> [Yelling, Chattering]<br> Don't expect us back too soon.<br> We kids are going after everything<br> from sardines to wolves.<br> You'll have no trouble<br> finding wolves, honey.<br> - Almost lunchtime?<br> - I've called a recess.<br> When your own fingers begin to look<br> like frankfurters, it's time for a slight rest.<br> [Giggles]<br> I suppose it's occurred to you...<br> that Lora Mae's kept herself as busy<br> as a bird dog ever since we got here.<br> The very thought of a hike<br> wears me out.<br> Maybe she just doesn't wanna sit still.<br> You sit still,<br> you can't help thinking, can you?<br> - Depends on what you think about.<br> - Well, for instance...<br> why your husband should suddenly decide<br> to go to the city on a Saturday morning.<br> - You mean Brad?<br> - No. I meant Porter.<br> He was at the station this morning.<br> He nearly knocked me down<br> when I was mailing my copy.<br> Funny Lora Mae doesn't<br> seem to know about it.<br> Why did you think<br> I meant Brad?<br> Maybe because it might<br> keep you from wondering...<br> why George dressed up<br> on Saturday with no school.<br> You're being a little too touchy about<br> a perfectly inoffensive remark, seems to me.<br> Oh, let's stop this sudden bickering.<br> We're beginning to behave<br> like some movie about a women's prison.<br> [Giggles]<br> Not a bad comparison at that.<br> - Cigarette.<br> - No, thanks.<br> [Addie's Voice]<br> Why wouldn't George go fishing?<br> [Distorted Voice]<br> Why wouldn't George go fishing?<br> [Addie's Voice]<br> Why the blue suit?<br> [Distorted Voice]<br> Why the blue suit?<br> [Horn Tooting]<br> - ## [Melodramatic Organ]<br> - [Sinister Laughter]<br> - [Screeching]<br> - [Woman] He's crazy!<br> ## [Chorus Singing]<br> - [Sinister Laughter]<br> - [Screeching]<br> [Music Ends]<br> Sadie, doesn't that noise<br> drive you insane?<br> - Restful, ain't it?<br> - ##[Swing]<br> - [Lowers Volume]<br> - There. That's better.<br> Well, the twins are fed<br> and ready to be put away.<br> Now if George<br> would only show up.<br> - How many canaps are you making?<br> - Two dozen.<br> The way I figure it, six healthy people<br> oughta be able to eat 2- or 300.<br> They're just appetizers, Sadie.<br> And let's get a couple<br> of things straight.<br> - First, when you announce dinner...<br> - I know.<br> - I'm not supposed to say, "Soup's on!"<br> - How did I tell you?<br> - I forgot.<br> - Dinner is served!<br> - Dinner is served.<br> - And you're not to say it as<br> though the food were poisoned.<br> As this fancy shmancy because two people<br> from the city are gonna eat here.<br> Mrs. Manleigh's<br> a very important person.<br> She has charge of a great many radio programs,<br> including the one I write.<br> You know what I like<br> about your programs.<br> Even when I'm running the vacuum,<br> I can understand it.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Now, the second thing.<br> Does the new uniform fit?<br> - It's kinda corny.<br> - Wear it.<br> Only one thing. The cap is out. Makes me<br> look like a lamb chop with pants on.<br> - Oh, Sadie.<br> - The cap is out.<br> Sadie, please.<br> Just this once.<br> - Okay. Okay.<br> - [Telephone Ringing]<br> Hello?<br> Oh, hello, Mrs. Manleigh.<br> No. No, not at all.<br> I was just rereading the scripts for Monday.<br> - [Increases Volume]<br> - [Whispers] No! Off!<br> - [Music Stops]<br> - What's that, Mrs. Manleigh?<br> Yes. It's a good connection.<br> About the script?<br> Oh. Well, I'll just have to<br> make the revisions tonight, that's all.<br> What? Oh, no, Mrs. Manleigh.<br> You've just got to come.<br> I've looked forward<br> so to your meeting George...<br> in line with that matter we discussed,<br> remember, Mrs. Manleigh?<br> [Sighs]<br> Yes, that's right.<br> He'll bejust perfect for us.<br> You'll see.<br> No, don't worry about that.<br> I always work best late at night anyway.<br> Yes. 7:30.<br> That'll be fine.<br> You can tell me about the changes<br> when you get here.<br> Fine. Good-bye, Mrs. Manleigh.<br> - [Car Approaching]<br> - There's George.<br> Changes, changes.<br> When am I supposed to sleep?<br> Uh, what's, uh, Mr. Phipps gonna be<br> so perfect for on the radio?<br> Nothing, and you keep quiet about it.<br> I will. [Giggles]<br> Only he won't.<br> Good evening one and all.<br> - Hello, George.<br> - Well, how now? Why the look of doom?<br> Ohhh. Did you forget<br> to baste the ducks?<br> Look. I don't teach you about teachin'.<br> Don't you teach me about duck.<br> Oh, Sadie's been an angel. Looks like I'll be<br> up most of the night making revisions.<br> - Mrs. Manleigh just called.<br> - But you're giving a dinner party for her tonight.<br> She suggested calling it off,<br> but I wouldn't hear of it.<br> Why can't Mrs. Manleigh,<br> just for once...<br> tell the sponsor to call off<br> his wife's revisions?<br> You don't tell a sponsor<br> things like that about his wife.<br> George, you...<br> you just don't understand.<br> No, I suppose not. Well, it may not make<br> your bad news any better...<br> but I got good news.<br> Have you, darling? Oh, George,<br> - Don't you wanna hear my good news?<br> - Of course I do.<br> - Did you get the liquor and cigarettes?<br> - Right here.<br> Oh, now, you check the cigarette boxes<br> while I put the liquor away.<br> Why does everything have to be full<br> when guests arrive?<br> Full cigarette boxes, candy dishes.<br> Fresh cakes of soap.<br> Aren't we supposed to eat,<br> smoke or wash when we're alone?<br> - Where's the scotch?<br> - I didn't buy any.<br> - Why not?<br> - Too expensive. Bourbon's a better drink anyway.<br> But the Manleighs<br> are a cinch to want scotch.<br> People in show business, you know what I mean.<br> Those kind always drink scotch.<br> Well, I know what you mean, but I wish<br> you wouldn't say it in radio English.<br> "That kind," not "those kind."<br> There are men who say "those kind"<br> who earn $100,000 a year.<br> There are men who say, "Stick 'em up,"<br> who earn more. I don't expect to do either.<br> Nor are you expected<br> to pay for the scotch.<br> You're quite right.<br> Funny how it slips my mind...<br> that in certain respects,<br> I'm only the titular head of this house.<br> Oh. Don't be silly, darling.<br> I thought it very amusing<br> to begin with.<br> Very, uh, modern and enlightened.<br> My tuxedo, for instance.<br> The same tuxedo that for some strange reason<br> you want me to wear tonight.<br> Well, what's so wrong about getting<br> dressed up once in a while?<br> Nothing at all, unless it's obviously<br> an attempt at pretense.<br> And just what is<br> so pretentious about tonight?<br> Tonight we'll sit down<br> to one of Sadie's duck dinners.<br> Present will be Porter and Lora Mae,<br> with whom we've had many such dinners...<br> when you wore slacks<br> and I didn't bother to shave.<br> But this time, also present will be two<br> advertising moguls who happen to employ you.<br> Their presence means<br> a new uniform for Sadie...<br> my children prisoners in their room...<br> and all the pomp and hysteria<br> usually reserved for coronations.<br> I call that pretense.<br> All right. So I'm out<br> to impress the boss.<br> What do I get for that, 30 years?<br> Tonight's important to me.<br> I've planned and worked, shopped...<br> taken the twins off Sadie's hands,<br> written my program...<br> and I'll be up all night tonight<br> and it's worth it to me.<br> And as far as<br> dressing's concerned...<br> you can come in a cowboy suit<br> for all I care.<br> [Sighs, Gasps]<br> Ohhh.<br> And why do the chairs have to look<br> as if nobody ever sat down in them?<br> [Weepy]<br> Because they do! Oh.<br> Aw, come on, Reet.<br> Let's cut it out.<br> - [Sobs]<br> - Look...<br> you finish up down here and see<br> if you can't relax for a few minutes.<br> - Are you all ready except for your dress?<br> - And combing out my hair.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Good. I'll put the twins to bed...<br> and call up the liquor store<br> to send over the scotch, all right?<br> - George?<br> - Hmm?<br> Please nojokes about radio. I'm afraid they<br> don't have much of a sense ofhumor about it.<br> Oh, neither have I.<br> The time for joking about it has passed.<br> Radio has become a very serious problem now,<br> like juvenile delinquency.<br> That's what I mean.<br> Cracks like that.<br> Oh, that wasn't a crack.<br> I meant it.<br> [Door Buzzer]<br> [Hushed]<br> George! George!<br> Sadie, don't open the door.<br> It might be the guests.<br> It can't be.<br> It's only 7:00.<br> If it is, they mustn't<br> see you like that.<br> - If they're that early, they deserve what they get.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Hiya, Sadie. For Mr. Phipps.<br> - Hi, Leo.<br> - Mr. Phipps?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Sure smells good.<br> - Wish I could say the same for you.<br> For Mr. Phipps.<br> Looks like a present.<br> A present?<br> A present? Ohhh.<br> What's up?<br> I wasn't sure I heard you call.<br> - It's for you.<br> - For me?<br> [Chuckles]<br> [Addie's Voice]<br> For George on his birthday.<br> "If music be the food oflove...<br> play on. "Addie.<br> Well, I'll be...<br> The Brahms.<br> The Concerto in B-flat.<br> Oh, it's a recording<br> made in Vienna before the war.<br> But how'd she find it?<br> - George.<br> - Hmm?<br> - It's your birthday today.<br> - I know.<br> - I just plumb forgot.<br> - Well, don't worry about it.<br> - I'm not much for birthdays.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - You're very much for birthdays.<br> - Well, this time you had a lot on your mind.<br> - Even so...<br> - "Happy birthday, George."<br> Happy birthday, George.<br> What a memory that girl's got.<br> Almost a year since we talked about it.<br> I'm gonna play it<br> for the twins right now.<br> - Sadie.<br> - What?<br> You didn't by any chance, make a layer cake<br> for dessert tonight instead, did you?<br> You know we got cherries jubilee.<br> You read it to me out of a book.<br> That's what I thought.<br> ##[Brahms's<br> "Concerto In B-flat"]<br> ## [Brahms's "Concerto<br> In B-flat" Finale]<br> [Music Ends]<br> Sometimes I don't think we appreciate<br> the miracle of the phonograph.<br> The privilege of having men of genius<br> perform for us at our command.<br> - What kind of a set is that?<br> - Hmm?<br> Oh, it's no particular make,<br> Mrs. Manleigh.<br> One of my students<br> put that together for me.<br> If I were you, I'd stick to the established<br> trademarks... a Puratone or a Sonobelle.<br> Puratone, Sonobelle.<br> I thought that sounded all right.<br> Didn't you, Porter?<br> Mine plays two dozen records, different sizes.<br> Mix 'em up any way you like.<br> Radio gets China clear as a bell.<br> Also television.<br> Except there's no television to get.<br> - We're too far away.<br> - Only television set in town.<br> Like playing tennis without a ball.<br> What do you want me to do about it,<br> build you a broadcasting station?<br> You don't need a station.<br> Just yell a little louder.<br> Uh, Mrs. Manleigh, are you sure<br> I can't get you a drink?<br> - A cocktail maybe or scotch?<br> - Never touch it...<br> alcohol that is, in any form.<br> - Oh. Uh, Mr. Manleigh?<br> - He doesn't either.<br> Well, coming from show business,<br> you might say...<br> I always imagined "those kind"<br> took a nip now and then.<br> Wouldn't be keeping faith<br> with our clients...<br> the most respected trademarks<br> in the American home.<br> Well, I think I'll have one more.<br> Porter?<br> I've often wondered, Porter,<br> why you haven't considered radio advertising.<br> Mr. Hollingsway has a chain<br> of seven department stores all over the state.<br> I know all about it. 23% by volume<br> over last year. 138% over 1939.<br> - Where'd you get those figures?<br> - They're a matter of public record, Mr. Hollingsway.<br> Yours is too big a light<br> to be hid under a bushel.<br> George, would you fix me<br> a small bromo seltzer?<br> - You're a potential giant, Mr. Hollingsway.<br> - Not too small.<br> - Doing all right.<br> - I said a potential giant.<br> Potential.<br> Something tells me I'm gonna<br> have a giant around the house.<br> Got this whole state<br> sewed up tight.<br> - But there are 47 other states, Porter.<br> - Crackerjack point.<br> Now, you take the three states<br> adjoining this one.<br> If I can put you,<br> Porter Hollingsway...<br> into millions of those homes<br> for one half hour each week...<br> He doesn't spend that much time<br> in his own home.<br> [Loud Clatter]<br> Excuse me.<br> I told you the screen<br> was a crummy idea.<br> - Soup's on.<br> - Thank you, Sadie.<br> - Mrs. Manleigh.<br> - Lora Mae.<br> [Chuckles] Sadie Dugan, what are you<br> supposed to be, Baby Snooks?<br> - Hiya, Lora Mae.<br> - Get a load of that cap. I can't wait to tell Ma.<br> Lora Mae, would you<br> sit there, please?<br> Come on. Sit down.<br> There's a couple of things<br> I could tell your ma about you too.<br> This quaint situation<br> belongs in a true-to-life drama.<br> - Are you two related?<br> - No, we just had the same governess.<br> [Laughing]<br> You kill me.<br> Uh, it's just a small town. You know,<br> everybody gets to know everybody.<br> If you don't mind<br> crossing the tracks.<br> Oh, by the way. Sadie's quite<br> a radio fan. Listens all the time.<br> Now, that's very interesting.<br> All the time, eh?<br> Keep it going night and day.<br> Tell me, uh, what are<br> your favorite programs?<br> During the day, anything.<br> - Anything?<br> - Anything that keeps my mind off my feet.<br> - I see.

The woods are full of girls.<br> - Not like you.<br> - You can say it again, not like me.<br> - And they don't want what I want.<br> - All right, what do you want?<br> Not a $4.00-a-week raise.<br> I don't want a new car, a fur coat...<br> or a trip to Hawaii<br> on a solid-gold yacht.<br> You don't carry what I want in any<br> of your seven big stores, Mr. Hollingsway.<br> Name it.<br> I want to be in a sliver frame<br> on a piano.<br> My own piano<br> in my own house.<br> - You mean you want to get married.<br> - Does that make me a freak?<br> I've been married once, you know that,<br> and once is enough for a man like me.<br> - Maybe I'm just not the type.<br> - Maybe you just haven't found the right girl.<br> Living with somebody all the time.<br> I'm not easy to get along with.<br> I'm set in my ways, I want to do<br> what I want when I want.<br> Why, if it was just a question<br> of the right girl...<br> wouldn't any man in the world<br> want to marry you?<br> Not if he thought<br> he could marry Addie Ross.<br> Maybe I don't know all the answers,<br> but I know some of them.<br> - It's late.
