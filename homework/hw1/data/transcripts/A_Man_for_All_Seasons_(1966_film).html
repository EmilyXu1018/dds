                        Every second bastard born<br> is fathered by a priest.<br> But in Utopia that couldn't be.<br> For why?<br> -For there the priests are very holy.<br> -Therefore very few.<br> Is it anything interesting, Matthew?<br> -Bless you, sir. I don't know.<br> -Bless you too, Matthew.<br> To be sure, we have<br> some holy priests in England.<br> -Oh, name some.<br> -Brother James.<br> Man's a simpleton.<br> It's from Cardinal Wolsey.<br> What's he want?<br> -Me.<br> -When?<br> Now.<br> In Hampton Court?<br> You won't be there by midnight.<br> -The King's business.<br> -Queen's business.<br> Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.<br> Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.<br> That's very true. And when the Cardinal<br> calls, you all come running, day or night.<br> What is the man? A butcher's son.<br> Chancellor of England, too.<br> No, that's his office. What's the man?<br> Surely, Your Grace,<br> when a man rises so high and so swiftly...<br> ...we must think he was misplaced<br> in his origins.<br> That, at least,<br> was the opinion of Aristotle and....<br> A butcher's son and looks it.<br> His looks, yes, I give you his looks.<br> What was that you said, Richard?<br> Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.<br> And Wolsey's still a butcher.<br> And you're a member of the King's<br> High Council, not an errand boy.<br> That is why I must go.<br> The Duke would go<br> if the Cardinal called him.<br> I might.<br> I'll be back for breakfast.<br> Go to bed.<br> "Dear Lord, give us rest tonight,<br> or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.<br> "Careful only for our soul's salvation.<br> For Christ's sake. Amen."<br> And bless our lord, the King.<br> -"And bless our lord, the King."<br> -Amen!<br> Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> Goodnight, Your Grace.<br> Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.<br> He's a frightened man.<br> -Who is that?<br> -A young friend from Cambridge.<br> -What's he want?<br> -What do they all want? A position.<br> -Can you give him a position?<br> -Do you recommend him?<br> No.<br> -Sir Thomas.<br> -No.<br> -Did you recommend me?<br> -No.<br> Richard, I may have a position for you.<br> -What? What position?<br> -Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.<br> For you all, boatman.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Master Cromwell.<br> You opposed me in the Council<br> this morning, Thomas.<br> Yes, Your Grace.<br> -You were the only one.<br> -Yes, Your Grace.<br> You're a fool.<br> Thank God there is only one fool<br> on the Council.<br> Why did you oppose me?<br> I thought Your Grace was wrong.<br> A matter of conscience.<br> You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.<br> If you could just see facts flat on...<br> ...without that horrible moral squint.<br> With a little common sense,<br> you could have made a statesman.<br> The King.<br> Where's he been? Do you know?<br> I, Your Grace?<br> Spare me your discretion.<br> He's been to play in the muck again.<br> He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.<br> More, are you going to help me?<br> If Your Grace will be specific.<br> You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.<br> The King wants a son.<br> What are you going to do about it?<br> I'm very sure the King needs no advice<br> from me on what to do about it.<br> Thomas, we're alone.<br> I give you my word, there's no one here.<br> I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.<br> Do you favour a change of dynasty?<br> Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?<br> For God's sake, Your Grace!<br> Then he needs a son. I repeat,<br> what are you going to do about it?<br> I pray for it daily.<br> God's death, he means it.<br> That thing out there, at least she's fertile.<br> -But she's not his wife.<br> -No, Catherine's his wife...<br> ...and she's barren as a brick.<br> Are you going to pray for a miracle?<br> There are precedents.<br> All right. Good. Pray by all means.<br> But in addition to prayer there is effort.<br> And my effort is to secure a divorce.<br> Have I your support, or have I not?<br> The Pope gave a dispensation,<br> so that the King might marry...<br> ...his brother's widow for state reasons.<br> We are to ask the Pope to dispense with<br> his dispensation, also for state reasons?<br> I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?<br> Then, clearly all we have to do is<br> to approach His Holiness and ask him.<br> I think we might influence<br> the decision of His Holiness.<br> By argument?<br> Argument certainly. And pressure.<br> Pressure, applied to the Church?<br> The Church has its church property.<br> Pressure.<br> No, Your Grace, I'm not going to help you.<br> Then goodnight, Master More.<br> Let the dynasty die with Henry Vlll<br> and we'll have dynastic wars again.<br> Blood-witted barons ramping the country<br> from end to end.<br> Is that what you want? Very well.<br> England needs an heir.<br> Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...<br> ...perhaps not, there's much in the Church<br> which needs reformation, Thomas.<br> All right, regrettable.<br> But necessary to get us an heir.<br> Now, explain how you, as a councillor<br> of England, can obstruct these measures...<br> ...for the sake<br> of your own private conscience.<br> I think that when statesmen forsake<br> their own private conscience...<br> ...for the sake of their public duties...<br> ...they lead their country<br> by a short route to chaos.<br> And we shall have my prayers<br> to fall back on.<br> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<br> To govern the country with prayers?<br> Yes, I should.<br> I'd like to be there when you try.<br> Who will wear this after me?<br> Who's our next chancellor?<br> You? Fisher? Suffolk?<br> -Fisher for me.<br> -Aye, but for the King?<br> What about my secretary,<br> Master Cromwell?<br> Cromwell. He's a very able man.<br> But?<br> Me rather than Cromwell.<br> Then, come down to earth.<br> Until you do...<br> ...you and I are enemies.<br> As Your Grace wishes.<br> As God wills.<br> Perhaps, Your Grace.<br> More! You should have been a cleric!<br> Like yourself, Your Grace?<br> Goodnight, Sir Thomas.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> -What's this?<br> -From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.<br> -Leicester?<br> -You do more good than you know, sir.<br> My daughter has a case, sir,<br> in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.<br> Baked apples, sir.<br> To sweeten my judgement.<br> I'll give your daughter the same judgement<br> I would give my own.<br> A fair one, quickly.<br> Bless you, sir.<br> I understand. Yes. I'll read it.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Good evening, Sir Thomas.<br> -I'll read it.<br> -It's an awkward case.<br> -I could illuminate it for you--<br> -I'll read it.<br> Just a moment or two....<br> Boat!<br> Sir?<br> Chelsea, sir?<br> Chelsea.<br> I expect you'll make it worth my while, sir.<br> -You've got a licence?<br> -Bless you, yes sir, I've got a licence.<br> -Well then, the fares are fixed.<br> -They are, sir.<br> Hampton to Chelsea downstream,<br> a penny halfpenny.<br> Chelsea to Hampton upstream,<br> a penny halfpenny.<br> Whoever makes the regulations<br> doesn't row a boat.<br> No. Threepence if you get me home<br> for breakfast.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> A nice cup, sir.<br> Yes.<br> That's worth money, sir.<br> Mind a way, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> -Have you been here all night?<br> -Yes.<br> You said there was a post?<br> Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house,<br> a servant and 50 a year.<br> What post?<br> At the new school.<br> A teacher!<br> Richard, no one's going to give you<br> a place at court.<br> Master Cromwell says<br> he'll do something for me.<br> Cromwell?<br> Well, if you know Cromwell<br> you don't need my help.<br> Sir Thomas?<br> If only you knew how much,<br> much rather, I had your help than his.<br> Not to a place at court.<br> Why not?<br> Look.<br> -What is it?<br> -It's a bribe!<br> "l am the gift of Averil Machin."<br> And Averil Machin has a lawsuit<br> in the Court of Requests.<br> Italian silver. Take it. No joke.<br> Thank you.<br> What will you do with it?<br> Sell it.<br> -And buy what?<br> -A decent gown!<br> But Richard, that's a little bribe.<br> At court they offer you all sorts of things,<br> home, manor houses, coats of arms.<br> A man should go<br> where he won't be tempted.<br> Why not be a teacher? You'd be<br> a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.<br> -lf I was, who would know it?<br> -You! Your pupils. Your friends.<br> God. Not a bad public, that.<br> And a quiet life.<br> You say that.<br> You come from talking with the Cardinal.<br> Yes, talking with the Cardinal.<br> It's eating your heart out, isn't it?<br> The high affairs of state.<br> The divorce?<br> Boatman!<br> Sir?<br> -Take this gentleman to the New lnn!<br> -Right, sir.<br> Sir Thomas?<br> Thank you.<br> Be a teacher.<br> -Matthew.<br> -Sir.<br> -Lady Alice in bed?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -Lady Margaret?<br> -No, sir.<br> The Master Roper's here, sir.<br> At this hour? Who let him in?<br> He's a hard man to keep out, sir.<br> Will wants to marry me, Father.<br> Well, he can't marry you.<br> Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.<br> Oh, congratulations, Roper.<br> My family may not be at the palace,<br> but in the city--<br> There's nothing wrong<br> with your family, Will.<br> There's not much wrong with you.<br> Except you seem to need a clock.<br> I can buy a clock, sir.<br> Roper, the answer is no...<br> ...and will be no as long as you're a heretic.<br> Now, that's a word I don't like,<br> Sir Thomas!<br> It's not a likeable word or thing.<br> The Church is heretical!<br> Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!<br> Luther is an excommunicate!<br> From a heretic Church!<br> Church? It's a shop!<br> -Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!<br> -Will, no!<br> -What I know, I'll say!<br> -You've no sense of the place!<br> He's no sense of the time.<br> Now listen well.<br> Two years ago you were<br> a passionate churchman.<br> Now you're a passionate Lutheran.<br> We must just pray<br> that when your head's finished turning...<br> ...your face is to the front again.<br> -ls your horse here?<br> -No, sir, I walked.<br> Well, take a horse from the stables<br> and get back home.<br> Go along.<br> May I come again?<br> Yes. Soon.<br> Is that final, Father?<br> As long as he's a heretic, Meg,<br> that's absolute.<br> What did Wolsey want?<br> Nice boy, young Will.<br> Terribly strong principles, though.<br> Clumsy, too.<br> -You're very pensive.<br> -You're very gay.<br> Was it the divorce?<br> To bed.<br> They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.<br> Always swimming against the stream.<br> Old Roper was just the same--<br> You don't want to talk about it.<br> No.<br> -I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.<br> -I wasn't sleeping very deeply.<br> What did Wolsey want?<br> -Will Roper's been.<br> -Will Roper?<br> Yes, he's been here all night.<br> He wants to marry Meg.<br> -Why you don't beat that girl l--<br> -No.<br> She's full of education<br> and it's a delicate commodity.<br> Goodnight, Meg.<br> Goodnight.<br> Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.<br> Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.<br> Norfolk spoke of you<br> for Chancellor of England before he left.<br> Well, he's a dangerous friend then.<br> Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.<br> But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you--<br> If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp<br> a few small boats like ours.<br> No.<br> There'll be no new chancellors<br> while Wolsey lives.<br> The Duke of Norfolk,<br> Earl Marshal of England.<br> Have you any message for His Majesty?<br> If I had served God...<br> ...one half so well as I've served my King...<br> ...God would not have left me here,<br> to die in this place.<br> Thank God you're dying here.<br> The King would have you die in the Tower.<br> "l am straightly charged<br> by the King himself...<br> "...here openly to declare<br> how much all England...<br> "...is beholden to this man.<br> "And how worthy he is<br> to have the highest room in the realm.<br> "And how dearly<br> the King's grace doth love and trust him...<br> "...not only for much good council...<br> "...deliberate council,<br> but for better council yet...<br> "...that which is privy to the King's person.<br> "This same Sir Thomas More...<br> "...here made before you all to be...<br> "...Lord Chancellor of the Realm."<br> Calm yourself, Matthew.<br> Fetch Lady Alice.<br> That's very well.<br> My lady! The King!<br> Now remember, the visit's a surprise.<br> But he'll know we're expecting him--<br> It's a very great honour.<br> One friend calling on another.<br> What's he really coming for?<br> To talk about the divorce.<br> He wants an answer.<br> -But he's had his answer.<br> -He wants another.<br> Thomas!<br> Your Majesty does my house more honour<br> than I fear my household will bear.<br> No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!<br> A passing fancy.<br> I happened to be on the river.<br> Look. Mud.<br> By heaven, what an evening.<br> Lady Alice,<br> I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.<br> Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.<br> Well, that is, we are ready to entertain--<br> This is my daughter Margaret, sire.<br> She's not yet had the honour<br> to meet Your Grace.<br> Why Margaret,<br> they told me you were a scholar.<br> Answer, Margaret.<br> Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.<br> Can you dance, too?<br> Not well, Your Grace.<br> Well, I dance superlatively!<br> That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!<br> Lady Alice,<br> the river's given me an appetite.<br> If Your Grace would share<br> a very simple supper.<br> It would please me. Lead them in.<br> Thomas and I will follow.<br> Matthew.<br> My lords and gentlemen!<br> Margaret?<br> Your Grace?<br> Do you like music?<br> Yes, Your Grace.<br> They'll play to you.<br> Now, listen to this.<br> Sit down.<br> Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.<br> You're my friend, are you not?<br> Your Majesty.<br> Thank God I have a friend<br> for my chancellor.<br> Readier to befriend, I trust,<br> than he was to be chancellor.<br> My own knowledge of my poor abilities--<br> I will judge of your abilities.<br> Thomas?<br> You know that Wolsey named you<br> for chancellor?<br> Before he died, Wolsey named you,<br> and Wolsey was no fool.<br> He was a statesman<br> of incomparable ability, Your Grace.<br> Was he?<br> Was he so?<br> Then, why did he fail me?<br> It was villainy then.<br> Yes, villainy. Secret opposition, secret.<br> But deliberate, wilful,<br> meditated opposition.<br> Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.<br> What is it? Thought!<br> Because I'm simple and plain and deal<br> with every man straightforwardly.<br> Because of that I say,<br> do they take me for a simpleton?<br> Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.<br> Pride right through.<br> And he failed me.<br> Failed me in the one thing that matters,<br> then as now.<br> But look.<br> Be seated.<br> What an evening.<br> A man could fight a lion.<br> Some men could, Your Grace.<br> Thomas...<br> ...touching this matter of my divorce.<br> Have you thought of it<br> since we last spoke?<br> Of little else.<br> Then you see your way clear to me?<br> That you should put away<br> Queen Catherine, sire?<br> Alas, as I think of it, I see so clearly...<br> ...that I cannot come with Your Grace,<br> that my endeavour is...<br> ...not to think of it at all.<br> Then you haven't thought enough!<br> Lilac.<br> We have them at Hampton.<br> Not so fine as this, though.<br> I'm in an excellent frame of mind.<br> Thomas, you must consider,<br> I stand in peril of my soul.<br> It was no marriage.<br> I have lived in incest<br> with my brother's widow.<br> Leviticus: "Thou shalt not uncover<br> the nakedness of thy brother's wife."<br> Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.<br> Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy--<br> Deuteronomy is ambiguous!<br> Your Grace, I'm not fitted<br> to meddle in these matters.<br> To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See--<br> Thomas, does a man need a pope<br> to tell him where he's sinned?<br> It was a sin.<br> God's punished me.<br> I've no son.<br> Son after son she's borne me.<br> All dead at birth, or dead within the month.<br> I never saw the hand of God<br> so clear in anything.<br> It's my bounden duty<br> to put away the Queen.<br> And all the popes, back to Peter,<br> shall not come between me and my duty!<br> How is it that you cannot see?<br> Everyone else does.<br> Then, why does Your Grace<br> need my poor support?<br> Because you're honest.<br> And what is more to the purpose,<br> you're known to be honest.<br> Those like Norfolk follow me<br> because I wear the crown.<br> Those like Cromwell follow<br> because they're jackals with sharp teeth...<br> ...and I'm their tiger. A mass follows me...<br> ...because it follows anything that moves.<br> And then there's you.<br> I am sick to think<br> how much I must displease Your Grace.<br> No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.<br> But respect...<br> ...man, that's water in the desert.<br> How'd you like our music?<br> That air they played, it had a certain....<br> Well, tell me what you thought of it.<br> Could it have been Your Grace's own?<br> Discovered!<br> Now I'll never know your true opinion,<br> and that's irksome.<br> Well, we artists, we love praise,<br> yet we love truth better.<br> -Then I will tell my true opinion.<br> -Well?<br> To me it seemed delightful.<br> Thomas, I chose the right man<br> for chancellor.<br> I should in fairness add that my taste<br> in music is reputedly deplorable.<br> Your taste in music is excellent!<br> It exactly coincides with my own.<br> Music.<br> Music.<br> Send them back without me, Thomas.<br> I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.<br> My house is at Your Grace's disposal.<br> Touching this other business, mark you...<br> ...I'll have no opposition.<br> Your Grace.<br> No opposition, I say. No opposition.<br> Be seated.<br> I'll leave you out of it<br> but you are my chancellor.<br> I don't take it kindly<br> and I'll have no opposition!<br> I see how it will be.<br> The bishops will oppose me!<br> The full-fed princes of the Church!<br> Hypocrites! All hypocrites!<br> Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!<br> Your Grace is unjust.<br> If I cannot serve Your Grace<br> in this great matter of the Queen.<br> I have no queen!<br> Catherine's not my wife!<br> No priest can make her so.<br> They that say she is my wife<br> are not only liars, but traitors!<br> Yes, traitors!<br> That I will not brook now!<br> Treachery!<br> I will not brook.<br> It maddens me!<br> It is a deadly canker in the body politic,<br> and I will have it out!<br> See?<br> You see how you've maddened me?<br> I hardly know myself.<br> If you could come with me,<br> there's no man I'd sooner raise...<br> ...yes, with my own hand.<br> Your Grace overwhelms me.<br> What's that?<br> Eight o'clock, Your Grace.<br> Lift yourself up, man.<br> Have I not promised I'll leave you out of it?<br> Shall we eat?<br> If Your Grace pleases.<br> Eight o'clock, you said.<br> The tide will be turning.<br> -I was forgetting the tide. I must go.<br> -I'm sorry, Your Grace.<br> If I don't catch the tide<br> I'll not get back to Richmond.<br> No, don't come.<br> Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.<br> Affairs call me to court.<br> So we give you our thanks<br> and we say goodnight!<br> What's this?<br> -You crossed him!<br> -Somewhat.<br> -Why?<br> -I couldn't find the other way.<br> You're too nice altogether, Thomas.<br> -Woman, mind your house!<br> -I am minding my house!<br> God save Your Majesty!<br> God save Your Grace!<br> God save the King!<br> Lift!<br> Drop blades!<br> Sire! Sire! Sire!<br> Are you coming my way, Rich?<br> No.<br> I think you should, you know.<br> I can't tell you anything.<br> Well?<br> Thomas?<br> Stay friends with him.<br> Whatever may be done by smiling,<br> you may rely on me to do.<br> Set your mind at rest.<br> This is not the stuff<br> of which martyrs are made.<br> Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.<br> Will wants to talk to you, Father.<br> I told him it wouldn't be convenient.<br> You were quite right.<br> You're very free<br> with my daughter's hand, Roper.<br> Yes.<br> It's of that I wish to speak.<br> Sir, you've had a disagreement<br> with His Majesty.<br> -Have l?<br> -So Meg tells me.<br> I offer my congratulations.<br> If it's true,<br> is it a matter for congratulation?<br> Yes!<br> Sir, when last I asked you<br> for your daughter's hand...<br> ...you objected to my unorthodox opinions.<br> -I did.<br> -Yes.<br> Well, since then my views<br> have somewhat modified.<br> Well, that's good hearing, Will.<br> Mind you, I modify nothing concerning<br> the various corruptions in the Church.<br> -Quite right.<br> -But an attack upon the Church herself...<br> ...no. I see behind that an attack on God.<br> -Roper!<br> -The Devil's work...<br> ...to be done by the Devil's ministers!<br> For heaven's sake, remember my office.<br> If you stand on your office--<br> No, I don't stand on it,<br> but there are certain things I may not hear.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Richard?<br> I fell.<br> Lady Alice.<br> -Lady Margaret.<br> -Good evening.<br> Do you know William Roper, the younger?<br> By reputation, of course.<br> -Good evening, Master....<br> -Rich.<br> You've heard of me?<br> Yes.<br> In what connection?<br> I don't know what you can have heard.<br> I sense that I'm not welcome here.<br> Why Richard? Have you done something<br> to make you not welcome?<br> Cromwell is asking questions.<br> About you. He's always asking<br> questions about you and your opinions.<br> Of whom?<br> Of him, for one. That's one of his sources.<br> Of course. That's one of my servants.<br> All right, Matthew.<br> Well, you look at me<br> as though I were an enemy.<br> Why Richard, you're shaking.<br> Help me.<br> How?<br> Employ me.<br> No.<br> -Employ me!<br> -No.<br> I would be faithful.<br> You couldn't answer for yourself<br> even so far as tonight.<br> Arrest him!<br> -For what?<br> -He's dangerous!<br> -Libel. He's a spy!<br> -That man's bad!<br> -There's no law against that.<br> -God's law!<br> -Then God can arrest him.<br> -While you talk, he's gone!<br> Go he should, if he were the Devil,<br> until he broke the law.<br> -Now you give the Devil benefit of law!<br> -Yes, what would you do?<br> Cut a road through the law<br> to get after the Devil?<br> Yes. I'd cut down every law in England<br> to do that.<br> And when the last law was down,<br> and the Devil turned on you...<br> ...where would you hide, Roper,<br> the laws all being flat?<br> This country is planted with laws<br> from coast to coast...<br> ...Man's laws, not God's,<br> and if you cut them down...<br> ...and you're just the man to do it...<br> ...do you really think you could stand<br> upright in the wind that would blow then?<br> Yes.<br> I give the Devil benefit of law<br> for my own safety's sake.<br> -Master Rich?<br> -Yes.<br> In there, sir.<br> Rich? Come in.<br> Taken you long enough to get here.<br> Have I kept you waiting?<br> Months.<br> -Here.<br> -Thank you.<br> Do you know the news?<br> -What news?<br> -Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.<br> And I succeed him.<br> Secretary to the Council?<br> You?<br> 'Tis surprising, isn't it?<br> I mean, one sees that's logical.<br> Sit down, Rich.<br> No ceremony, no courtship...<br> ...as His Majesty would say.<br> You see how I trust you.<br> I'd never repeat or report a thing like that.<br> What kind of thing<br> would you repeat or report?<br> Nothing said in friendship.<br> Do you believe that?<br> -Why, yes.<br> -No, seriously.<br> Well, yes.<br> Rich, seriously.<br> That would depend what I was offered.<br> Don't say it just to please me.<br> It's true. It would depend<br> what I was offered.<br> Well, there is another post vacant.<br> Collector of Revenues for York.<br> Is it in your gift?<br> Effectively.<br> What must I do for it?<br> I know a man<br> who wants to change his woman.<br> Normally a matter of small importance,<br> but in this case...<br> ...it's our liege, Lord Henry,<br> the eighth of that name.<br> Which is a quaint way of saying that<br> if he wants to change his woman, he will.<br> And our job as administrators...<br> ...is to minimise the inconvenience<br> which this is going to cause.<br> That's our only job, Rich,<br> to minimise the inconvenience of things.<br> A harmless occupation<br> you would say, but no.<br> We administrators are not liked, Rich.<br> We are not popular.<br> I say "we" on the assumption you'll accept<br> the post at York I've offered you.<br> Yes.<br> It's a bad sign when people are depressed<br> by their own good fortune.<br> -I'm not depressed.<br> -You look depressed.<br> I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.<br> Some time ago.<br> Have you only just noticed?<br> Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor,<br> now there's an innocent man.<br> The odd thing is, he is.<br> Yes, I say he is. Unhappily...<br> ...his innocence is tangled up<br> in this problem...<br> ...that you can't change your woman<br> without a divorce...<br> ...and you can't get a divorce<br> unless the Pope says so.<br> And from this meaningless circumstance,<br> I foresee a certain measure of....<br> -lnconvenience?<br> -Just so.<br> This goblet he gave you,<br> how much was it worth?<br> Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.<br> How much did you get for it?<br> Fifty shillings.<br> It was a gift, wasn't it,<br> from a litigant, a woman?<br> -Yes.<br> -Which court? Chancery?<br> Don't get drunk!<br> Which court was the litigant's case?<br> Court of Requests.<br> There. That wasn't too painful, was it?<br> -No.<br> -No.<br> And you'll find it easier, next time.<br> My Lord Archbishop, my lords...<br> ...Reverend Doctors of the Church.<br> The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...<br> ...to his trusty well-beloved subjects...<br> ...pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.<br> "His Majesty...<br> "...acknowledges your humble admission<br> of many grievous errors...<br> "...for which he accepts...<br> "...the manumission of 100,000 in token.<br> "Mindful for the well-being of the realm<br> and the quietness of his subjects...<br> "...His Majesty requires that you do now<br> straightly renounce your pretended...<br> "...allegiance to the See of Rome.<br> "And admit the statute<br> passed through parliament...<br> "...acknowledging the King's good title...<br> "...Supreme Head of the Church<br> in England."<br> Well, my lords, what's your answer?<br> Yea or nay?<br> His Majesty accepts your resignation<br> very sadly.<br> He's mindful of your goodness<br> and past loyalty.<br> And in any matter concerning your honour<br> and welfare he'll continue your good lord.<br> You will convey my humble gratitude.<br> -Help me with this.<br> -Not l.<br> -Alice?<br> -No.<br> Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken<br> for a wise man. Is this wisdom?<br> To betray your ability...<br> ...abandon your station<br> and forget your duty to your kith and kin?<br> Shall l, sir?<br> No, thank you, son Roper.<br> Margaret...<br> ...will you?<br> Yes.<br> If you want.<br> There's my clever girl.<br> Well done, sir! In my opinion,<br> that thing's a degradation.<br> I'll tell you my opinion<br> of the King's title, too--<br> Don't! Will, silence!<br> Remember, you have a wife now...<br> ...and may have children.<br> All right, Thomas, make me understand...<br> ...because I tell you,<br> to me this looks like cowardice!<br> All right, I will.<br> This isn't reformation,<br> this is war against the Church.<br> Our King has declared war on the Pope<br> because the Pope will not declare...<br> -...that our Queen is not his wife.<br> -And is she?<br> Is she?<br> Have I your word that what we say here<br> is between us two?<br> Very well.<br> And if the King should command you<br> to repeat what I may say?<br> I should keep my word to you.<br> Then what has become of your oath<br> of obedience to the King?<br> You lay traps for me!<br> No, I show you the times.<br> We are at war with the Pope.<br> For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?<br> He is. He's also the descendant<br> of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.<br> So you believe.<br> And will you forfeit all you have...<br> ...which includes the respect<br> of your country, for a belief?<br> Because what matters<br> is that I believe it, or rather, no...<br> ...not that I believe it, but that I believe it.<br> -I trust I make myself obscure?<br> -Perfectly.<br> Why do you insult me<br> with this lawyer's chatter?<br> Because I'm afraid.<br> Man, you're ill.<br> This isn't Spain, you know.<br> This is England.<br> My friends, you all know<br> why I've called you here.<br> I have today resigned my office.<br> I am no longer a great man.<br> Sir, we want you to know<br> that we're all on your side.<br> My side? What side is that?<br> Well, sir, we all know what you think.<br> None of you knows what I think.<br> And if you guess...<br> ...and babble it about,<br> you do me no good service.<br> Since I am no more a great man,<br> I no longer need a great household.<br> Nor can I afford one. You will have to go.<br> However, I still number some great men<br> among my friends...<br> ...and they still need great households.<br> No one will be turned away<br> until we've found another place for him.<br> -We can't find places for them all.<br> -Yes, we can.<br> Thank you.<br> That is all.<br> What about you, Matthew?<br> Will you stay?<br> Well, sir, that's according.<br> There will be more work and less money.<br> Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.<br> After all, I've got my own--<br> Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?<br> I shall miss you, Matthew.<br> Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.<br> I know that.<br> I shall miss you.<br> Damn me! Isn't that them all over!<br> Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?<br> "Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"<br> No, Sir Thomas, I will not.<br> And that's it. And that's all of it! All right,<br> so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.<br> I don't mind saying<br> that I'm sorry, bad luck.<br> If I had good luck to spare<br> he could have some!<br> I wish we could have good luck<br> all the time.<br> I wish rainwater was beer!<br> I wish we had wings! But we don't.<br> Well, there's an end of you.<br> What'll you do now? Sit by the fire...<br> ...and make goslings in the ash?<br> Not at all, Alice.<br> I expect I'll write a bit...<br> ...I'll write...<br> ...I'll read, I'll think.<br> I think I'll learn to fish.<br> I'll play with my grandchildren<br> when son Roper's done his duty.<br> -Alice, shall I teach you to read?<br> -No, by God!<br> Poor, silly man,<br> you think they'll leave you here to think?<br> If we govern our tongues, they will!<br> I have a word to say on that. I've made<br> no statement. I've resigned, that's all.<br> The King is made, by act of parliament,<br> Supreme Head of the Church in England.<br> This English Church will divorce him from<br> the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.<br> But on any of these matters,<br> have you heard me make a statement?<br> No.<br> If I'm to lose my rank and fall to<br> housekeeping, I want to know the reason.<br> -So make a statement now.<br> -No.<br> Alice, it's a point of law.<br> Accept it from me...<br> ...that in silence is my safety,<br> under the law.<br> And my silence must be absolute,<br> it must extend to you.<br> In short, you don't trust me.<br> I'm the Lord Chief Justice,<br> I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.<br> I take your hand...<br> ...I clamp it on the Bible,<br> on the blessed Cross and I say:<br> "Woman, has your husband<br> made a statement on these matters?<br> "On peril of your soul remember,<br> what is your answer?"<br> No.<br> And so it must remain.<br> Have you opened your mind to Meg?<br> Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?<br> Meg has your heart.<br> I know that well enough.<br> This is a dangerous matter then...<br> ...if you've not told Meg.<br> I don't think so. No.<br> When they find I'm silent...<br> ...they'll want nothing better<br> than to leave me silent.<br> You'll see.<br> But he's silent, Master Secretary,<br> why not leave him silent?<br> Your Grace, not being a man of letters...<br> ...you perhaps don't realise<br> the extent of his reputation.<br> This silence of his<br> is bellowing up and down Europe!<br> In Europe he is claimed<br> as the King's enemy.<br> Rubbish! Crank he may be,<br> traitor he is not.<br> Exactly. And with a little pressure....<br> With a little pressure<br> he can be got to say so.<br> That's all we need.<br> A brief declaration of his loyalty...<br> -...to the present administration.<br> -I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.<br> The King does not agree with you.<br> What kind of pressure do you think<br> you can bring to bear?<br> I have evidence that Sir Thomas,<br> while he was a judge, accepted bribes.<br> What?<br> Goddammit! He was the only judge<br> since Cato who didn't accept bribes!<br> When was there a chancellor<br> whose possessions, after three years...<br> ...totalled 100 and a gold chain?<br> It is, as you imply, common practice...<br> ...but a practice may be common<br> and remain an offence.<br> This offence could send a man<br> to the Tower.<br> Come here.<br> This woman's name is Averil Machin.<br> She comes from Leicester.<br> -She entered a case--<br> -A property case it was.<br> Shut your mouth.<br> A property case in the Court of Requests<br> in April, 1528.<br> And got a wicked false judgement!<br> And got an impeccably correct judgement<br> from Sir Thomas.<br> -No, sir, it was not!<br> -Tell the gentleman...<br> ...about the gift you gave the judge.<br> I gave him a cup, sir.<br> A silver ltalian cup I bought in Leicester,<br> for 100 shillings.<br> Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?<br> Yes, sir, he did.<br> He did accept it. We can corroborate that.<br> You can go.<br> -To my way of thinking--<br> -Go!<br> -ls that your witness?<br> -No.<br> By an odd coincidence that cup later<br> came into the hands of Master Rich here.<br> How?<br> -He gave it to me, Your Grace.<br> -Gave it to you? Why?<br> A gift.<br> Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?<br> When did Thomas give you this thing?<br> I can't exactly remember.<br> Do you "remember" what you did with it?<br> -I sold it.<br> -Where?<br> -A shop.<br> -Has the shop still got it?<br> No. They've lost all track of it.<br> How convenient.<br> You doubt Master Rich's word,<br> Your Grace?<br> It had occurred to me.<br> This is the bill of sale.<br> That cow put her case into court in April,<br> you said. This is dated May.<br> In other words, the moment Thomas knew<br> the cup was a bribe...<br> ...he dropped it into the nearest gutter.<br> The facts will bear that interpretation,<br> I suppose.<br> This is a horse that won't run,<br> Master Secretary.<br> Just a trial gallop.<br> We'll find something better.<br> -I want no part of it.<br> -You have no choice.<br> What's that you say?<br> The King particularly wishes you<br> to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.<br> He's not told me that.<br> Indeed? He told me.<br> Look here, Cromwell...<br> ...what's the purpose of all this?<br> There you have me.<br> It's a matter of conscience, I think.<br> The King wants Sir Thomas<br> to bless his marriage.<br> If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding<br> now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.<br> He won't attend the wedding.<br> If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.<br> I really would try, if I were you.<br> Cromwell, are you threatening me?<br> My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.<br> This is England!<br> Thomas? Thomas!<br> Lady Margaret?<br> Yes.<br> We've been cutting greens.<br> We use them for fuel.<br> I have a letter for your father,<br> Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.<br> He's to answer certain charges<br> before Secretary Cromwell.<br> Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.<br> Master Rich will make a record<br> of our conversation.<br> Good of you to tell me, Master Secretary.<br> I think you know one another.<br> Indeed yes, we're old friends.<br> That's a nice gown you have, Richard.<br> Sir Thomas, believe me.<br> No, that's asking too much.<br> But let me tell you all the same.<br> You have no more sincere admirer<br> than myself.<br> No, not yet, Rich, not yet.<br> If I might hear the charges.<br> -The charges?<br> -I understand there are certain charges.<br> Some ambiguities of behaviour<br> I should like to clarify, hardly charges.<br> Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?<br> There are no charges.<br> Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.<br> The King is not pleased with you.<br> I am grieved.<br> And yet, do you know that even now,<br> if you could bring yourself...<br> ...to agree with the Church,<br> universities, the Lords and the Commons...<br> ...there is no honour which His Majesty<br> would be likely to deny you?<br> I am well acquainted with<br> His Grace's generosity.<br> Very well.<br> You have heard of the so-called<br> "Holy Maid of Kent"...<br> ...who was executed for prophesying<br> against the King?<br> -Yes, I met her.<br> -Yes, you met her.<br> Yet you did not warn His Majesty<br> of her treason. How was that?<br> She spoke no treason.<br> Our talk was not political.<br> But the woman was notorious.<br> Do you expect me to believe that?<br> -Happily, there were witnesses.<br> -You wrote a letter to her.<br> Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain<br> from meddling in the affairs of state.<br> I have a copy of the letter. Also witnessed.<br> -You have been cautious.<br> -I like to keep my affairs regular.<br> In the June of 1521,<br> the King published a book.<br> A theological work.<br> It was called,<br> A Defence of the Seven Sacraments.<br> For which he was named "Defender<br> of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.<br> By the Bishop of Rome,<br> or do you insist on "pope"?<br> No. "Bishop of Rome" if you like.<br> It doesn't alter his authority.<br> Thank you. You come to the point<br> very readily. What is that authority?<br> For example, in the Church of England...<br> ...what exactly is<br> the Bishop of Rome's authority?<br> You will find it very ably set out<br> and defended, Master Secretary...<br> ...in the King's book.<br> In the book published under<br> the King's name, would be more accurate.<br> -You wrote this book.<br> -I wrote no part of it.<br> I don't mean you actually held the pen.<br> I answered to my best ability,<br> some points of common law...<br> ...which the King put to me,<br> as I was bound to do.<br> Do you deny you instigated it?<br> It was from first to last<br> the King's own project.<br> The King says not.<br> The King knows the truth of it.<br> And whatever he may have said to you...<br> ...he will not give evidence<br> to support this accusation.<br> Why not?<br> Because evidence is given on oath,<br> and he will not perjure himself.<br> If you don't know that,<br> then you don't yet know him.<br> Sir Thomas More.<br> Have you anything to say...<br> ...regarding the King's marriage<br> with Queen Anne?<br> I understood<br> I was not to be asked that again.<br> Then you understood wrongly.<br> These charges--<br> They are terrors for children,<br> Master Secretary, not for me!<br> Then know that the King<br> commands me to charge you...<br> ...in his name, with great ingratitude!<br> And to tell you that there never was,<br> nor could be, so villainous a servant...<br> ...nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!<br> So...<br> ...I am brought here at last.<br> Brought?<br> You've brought yourself<br> to where you stand now.<br> You may go.<br> For the present.<br> What will you do now?<br> Whatever's necessary.<br> Boat!<br> Oh, come, come, it's not as bad as all that!<br> Howard!<br> I can't get home.<br> They won't bring me a boat.<br> Do you blame them?<br> Is it as bad as that?<br> It's every bit as bad as that!<br> Then it's good of you to be seen with me.<br> I followed you.<br> Were you followed?<br> -You're dangerous to know!<br> -Then don't know me.<br> -I do know you.<br> -I mean as a friend.<br> -I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.<br> -What's to be done then?<br> -Give in.<br> -I can't give in, Howard.<br> Our friendship's more mutable than that.<br> The one fixed point in the world<br> of turning friendship...<br> -...is that Sir More won't give in.<br> -To me it has to be, for that's myself.<br> Affection goes as deep in me<br> as you, I think.<br> But only God is love right through,<br> Howard, and that's my self.<br> And who are you?<br> A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!<br> We're supposed to be the proud ones,<br> the arrogant ones, we've all given in.<br> Why must you stand out?<br> Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!<br> You'll break my heart.<br> No one is safe, Howard,<br> and you have a son.<br> We'll end our friendship now.<br> -For friendship's sake?<br> -Yes.<br> Daft!<br> Norfolk, you're a fool!<br> You can't place a quarrel,<br> you haven't the style.<br> Hear me out. You and your class<br> have given in, as you rightly call it...<br> ...'cause this country's religion<br> means nothing to you at all.<br> Well, that's a foolish saying for a start!<br> The nobility of England--<br> The nobility of England would have<br> snored through the Sermon on the Mount!<br> But you'll labour like scholars<br> over a bulldog's pedigree.<br> An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.<br> We've had a quarrel since the day we met.<br> Our friendship was mere sloth.<br> You can be cruel when you want,<br> but I've always known that.<br> What do you value in your bulldogs?<br> Gripping, is it not?<br> -Yes.<br> -It's their nature?<br> -Yes.<br> -It's why you breed them?<br> It's so with men.<br> I will not give in, because I oppose it.<br> Not my pride, not my spleen,<br> nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.<br> Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,<br> no sinew that serves no appetite...<br> ...of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?<br> There is!<br> -Give that some exercise, my lord!<br> -Thomas!<br> As you stand you'll go before your Maker<br> ill conditioned!<br> Now steady.<br> And he'll think that, somewhere back along<br> your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!<br> Cast in this very house<br> on April 3, last year...<br> ...it is a matter very fit<br> for the Commons, gathered here...<br> ...in parliament, to take in hand.<br> Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds...<br> ...the woolen cloth, now coming out<br> of Yorkshire, Lincoln...<br> ...and the like, is not to blame and this....<br> I will defer the rest of my matter to later.<br> That the loyal Commons, here assembled,<br> will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.<br> For as much as it concerns the King's<br> new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.<br> Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.<br> Mark, my Masters...<br> ...there is among us<br> a brood of discreet traitors...<br> ...to which deceit<br> the King can brook no longer.<br> And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now<br> drive these subtle foxes from their covert.<br> Father?<br> Margaret!<br> I couldn't get a boat.<br> What is it, Meg?<br> Father, there's a new act<br> going through parliament.<br> And by this act,<br> they're going to administer an oath...<br> ...about the marriage.<br> On what compulsion is the oath?<br> -High treason.<br> -But what is the wording?<br> Do the words matter?<br> We know what it means.<br> Tell me the words.<br> An oath is made of words.<br> It may be possible to take it.<br> Take it?<br> And if it can be taken,<br> you must take it, too.<br> No!<br> Listen, Meg. God made the angels<br> to show him splendour.<br> As he made animals for innocence<br> and plants for their simplicity.<br> But Man he made to serve him wittily,<br> in the tangle of his mind.<br> If he suffers us to come to such a case<br> that there is no escaping...<br> ...then we may stand to our tackle<br> as best we can.<br> And yes, Meg, then we can clamour<br> like champions, if we have the spittle for it.<br> But it's God's part, not our own,<br> to bring ourselves to such a pass.<br> Our natural business lies in escaping.<br> If I can take this oath, I will.<br> I would, for my sake,<br> you could take the oath.<br> I never took a man into the Tower<br> less willingly.<br> Thank you, Master Governor.<br> Thank you.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Sir Thomas!<br> This is iniquitous.<br> -Where to this time?<br> -Richmond Palace.<br> Sit down.<br> This is the Seventh Commission<br> to inquire into the case...<br> ...of Sir Thomas More, appointed<br> by His Majesty's Council.<br> Have you anything to say?<br> No.<br> -Seen this document before?<br> -Many times.<br> It is the Act of Succession.<br> These are the names<br> of those who have sworn to it.<br> -I have, as you say, seen it before.<br> -Will you swear to it?<br> No.<br> Thomas, we must know--<br> We must know plainly whether you<br> recognise the offspring of Queen Anne...<br> ...as heirs to the throne.<br> The King in parliament<br> tells me that they are.<br> -Of course I recognise them.<br> -Will you swear to it?<br> -Yes.<br> -Then why won't he swear to the act?<br> Because there is more than that in the act.<br> Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the<br> preamble that the King's former marriage...<br> ...to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...<br> ...she being his brother's widow and<br> the Pope having no authority to sanction it.<br> Is that what you deny?<br> Is that what you dispute?<br> Is that what you are not sure of?<br> You insult His Majesty and Council<br> in the person of the Lord Archbishop!<br> I insult no one.<br> I will not take the oath.<br> I will not tell you why I will not.<br> -Then your reasons must be treasonable!<br> -Not "must be," may be.<br> It's a fair assumption!<br> The law requires more than an assumption,<br> the law requires a fact.<br> Of course, I cannot judge<br> your legal standing in the case...<br> ...but until I know the ground<br> of your objections...<br> ...I can only guess<br> your spiritual standing, too.<br> If you're willing to guess that, it should be<br> small matter to guess my objections.<br> Then you do have objections to the act?<br> Well, we know that, Cromwell!<br> No, my lord, you don't.<br> You may suppose I have objections,<br> all you know is that I will not swear to it...<br> ...for which you cannot lawfully<br> harm me further.<br> But if you were right in supposing me<br> to have objections, and right again...<br> ...in supposing my objections<br> to be treasonable...<br> ...the law would let you cut my head off.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Well done, Sir Thomas.<br> I've been trying to make that clear<br> to His Grace for some time.<br> Oh, confound all this! I'm not a scholar.<br> I don't know if the marriage<br> was lawful or not...<br> ...but damn it, Thomas,<br> look at these names.<br> Why can't you do as I did,<br> and come with us, for fellowship?<br> And when we die, and you are sent<br> to heaven for doing your conscience...<br> ...and I am sent to hell for not doing mine,<br> will you come with me, for fellowship?<br> So, those of us whose names are there,<br> are damned, Sir Thomas?<br> I have no window to look into<br> another man's conscience.<br> I condemn no one.<br> -Then the matter is capable of question?<br> -Certainly.<br> But that you owe obedience to the King<br> is not capable of question.<br> So weigh a doubt against a certainty<br> and sign.<br> Some men think the earth is round,<br> others think it flat.<br> It is a matter capable of question.<br> But if it is flat,<br> will the King's command make it round?<br> And if it is round,<br> will the King's command flatten it?<br> No, I will not sign.<br> Then you have more regard for<br> your own doubt than the King's command?<br> -For myself I have no doubt.<br> -No doubt of what?<br> No doubt that I will not take this oath.<br> But why I will not, you,<br> Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.<br> I might get it out of you in other ways.<br> You threaten like a dockside bully.<br> How should I threaten?<br> Like a minister of state, with justice!<br> Justice is what you're threatened with.<br> Then I am not threatened.<br> Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?<br> Aye. The prisoner may retire<br> as he requests.<br> -Unless you--<br> -I see no purpose in prolonging this.<br> Then, goodnight, Thomas.<br> May I have one or two more books?<br> Why, you have books?<br> Yes.<br> I didn't know, you shouldn't have.<br> May I see my family?<br> No.<br> Captain!<br> Master Secretary?<br> Have you ever heard the prisoner speak<br> of the King's divorce, supremacy...<br> -...or the King's marriage?<br> -No, not a word.<br> If he does, you will repeat it to me.<br> Of course.<br> Rich.<br> Secretary?<br> Tomorrow morning,<br> remove the prisoner's books.<br> Is that necessary?<br> With regards to this case,<br> the King is becoming impatient.<br> -Aye, with you.<br> -With all of us.<br> The King's impatience<br> will embrace a duke or two.<br> Master Secretary.<br> Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.<br> The Attorney General for Wales.<br> His post is vacant.<br> You said that I might approach you.<br> Not now, Rich.<br> He must submit. He must!<br> Rack him.<br> No. The King's conscience<br> will not permit it.<br> We have to find some other way.<br> Sir Thomas!<br> Father!<br> What? Margaret?<br> Father!<br> Meg. For God's sake,<br> they haven't put you in here?<br> -No, sir, a visit.<br> -A brief one, Sir Thomas.<br> Father.<br> -Good morning, husband.<br> -Good morning.<br> Good morning, Will.<br> Well, this is a hellish place!<br> Except it's keeping me from you,<br> my dears, it isn't so bad.<br> It's remarkably like any other place.<br> -lt drips!<br> -Yes. It's too near the river.<br> Well, what is it?<br> Father, come out!<br> Swear to the act and come out!<br> Is this why they've let you come?<br> Yes.<br> Meg's under oath to persuade you.<br> That was silly, Meg.<br> How do you plan to do that?<br> Father.<br> "God more regards the thoughts<br> of the heart than the words of the mouth."<br> -Well, so you've always told me.<br> -Yes.<br> Then say the words of the oath<br> and in your heart think otherwise.<br> What is an oath then,<br> but words we say to God?<br> Listen, Meg.<br> When a man takes an oath, he's holding<br> his own self in his own hands...<br> ...Iike water.<br> And if he opens his fingers then,<br> he needn't hope to find himself again.<br> Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be<br> loathed to think your father one of them.<br> -I have another argument.<br> -Oh, Meg.<br> In any state that was half good,<br> you would be raised up high, not here...<br> -...for what you've done already.<br> -All right.<br> It's not your fault<br> the state's three-quarters bad.<br> No.<br> If you elect to suffer for it,<br> you elect to be a hero.<br> That's very neat.<br> But look now. If we lived in a state<br> where virtue was profitable...<br> ...common sense would make us saintly.<br> But since we see that avarice, anger,<br> pride and stupidity...<br> ...commonly profit far beyond charity,<br> modesty, justice and thought...<br> ...perhaps we must stand fast a little...<br> ...even at the risk of being heroes.<br> But in reason!<br> Haven't you done as much<br> as God can reasonably want?<br> Well, finally it isn't a matter of reason.<br> Finally, it's a matter of love.<br> You're content then to be shut up here<br> with mice and rats...<br> -...when you might be home with us?<br> -Content?<br> If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be<br> through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.<br> I haven't told you<br> what the house is like without you.<br> Don't, Meg.<br> -What we do in the evening without you.<br> -Meg, have done.<br> We don't read because we've no candles.<br> We don't talk because we wonder<br> what they're doing to you.<br> The King is more merciful.<br> He doesn't use the rack.<br> Two minutes to go, sir.<br> -I thought you'd like to know.<br> -Two minutes!<br> -Jailer!<br> -Sorry, sir. Two minutes.<br> Listen, you must leave the country.<br> All of you must leave the country.<br> -And leave you?<br> -lt makes no difference.<br> They won't let me see you again.<br> You must all go on the same day,<br> but not on the same boat.<br> -Different boats from different ports.<br> -After the trial, then.<br> There'll be no trial, they have no case.<br> Do this for me, I beseech you.<br> -Will?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -Margaret?<br> -Yes.<br> Alice?<br> -Alice, I command you!<br> -Right.<br> This is splendid.<br> -I know who packed this.<br> -I packed it.<br> Yes.<br> You still make a superlative custard, Alice.<br> Do l?<br> That's a nice dress you have on.<br> Nice colour anyway.<br> My God, you think little of me!<br> I know I'm a fool...<br> ...but I'm not such a fool<br> as to be lamenting for my dresses...<br> ...or to relish complimenting<br> on my custards.<br> I'm well rebuked.<br> -Alice--<br> -No!<br> I'm sick with fear when I think of the worst<br> they may do to me.<br> But worse than that will be to go<br> with you not understanding why I go.<br> I don't.<br> If you can tell me that you understand,<br> I might make a good death, if I have to.<br> -Your death's no good to me.<br> -You must tell me that you understand.<br> I don't!<br> I don't believe this had to happen!<br> If you say that<br> I don't see how I'm to face it.<br> It's the truth!<br> -You're an honest woman.<br> -Much good may it do me.<br> I'll tell you what I'm afraid of...<br> ...that when you've gone,<br> I shall hate you for it.<br> You mustn't, Alice.<br> You mustn't.<br> As for understanding, I understand you're<br> the best man I ever met or ever likely to.<br> And if you go, God knows why I suppose,<br> though as God's my witness...<br> ...God's kept deadly quiet about it.<br> And if any one wants to know<br> my opinion of the King and his Council...<br> ...he only has to ask for it!<br> Why, it's a lion I married.<br> A lion. A lion.<br> This is good.<br> It's very good.<br> Sorry, Sir Thomas!<br> -Oh, for pity's sake!<br> -Time's up, sir.<br> -But one more minute!<br> -You don't know what you're asking.<br> -Come along, Miss.<br> -For heaven's sake.<br> Now, don't do that, sir.<br> Now, madam, don't make trouble.<br> Come along, please, Lady Alice.<br> Take your muddy paws off me!<br> Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!<br> I'll see you suffer for this!<br> Goodbye.<br> You must understand my position, sir.<br> I'm a plain, simple man<br> and I just want to keep out of trouble.<br> Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Saviour,<br> clear my wits.<br> Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God,<br> comfort my wife and daughter...<br> ...and forgive me for them.<br> Sir Thomas More, though you have<br> heinously offended the King's majesty...<br> ...we hope that if you'll even now<br> forethink and repent of obstinate opinion...<br> ...you may still taste his gracious pardon.<br> My lords, I thank you.<br> As for the matters<br> you may charge me with...<br> ...I fear from my present weakness,<br> that neither my wit...<br> ...nor my memory will serve...<br> ...to make sufficient answer.<br> I should be glad to sit down.<br> A chair for the prisoner.<br> Master Secretary Cromwell,<br> have you the charge?<br> -I have, my lord.<br> -Then read the charge.<br> "That you did wilfully and maliciously<br> deny and deprive...<br> "...our liege, Lord Henry,<br> of his undoubted certain title...<br> "...Supreme Head of the Church<br> in England."<br> But, I have never denied this title.<br> At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth,<br> and again at Richmond...<br> ...you stubbornly refused the oath.<br> Was this no denial?<br> No, this was silence.<br> And for my silence,<br> I am punished with imprisonment.<br> -Why have I been called again?<br> -On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.<br> For which the punishment<br> is not imprisonment.<br> Death...<br> ...comes for us all, my lords.<br> Yes, even for kings he comes.<br> The death of kings is not in question,<br> Sir Thomas.<br> Nor mine, I trust, until I'm proven guilty.<br> Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas,<br> as it always has!<br> Is that so, my lord?<br> Then I'll keep a good grip on it.<br> So, Sir Thomas...<br> ...you stand on your silence?<br> I do.<br> But, gentlemen of the jury...<br> ...there are many kinds of silence.<br> Consider first the silence of a man<br> when he is dead.<br> Suppose we go into the room<br> where he is laid out and we listen.<br> What do we hear?<br> Silence.<br> What does it betoken, this silence?<br> Nothing. This is silence pure and simple.<br> But let us take another case.<br> Suppose I were to take a dagger<br> from my sleeve...<br> ...and make to kill the prisoner with it.<br> And my lordships there, instead of crying<br> out for me to stop, maintain their silence.<br> That would betoken!<br> It would betoken a willingness<br> that I should do it.<br> And under the law,<br> they would be guilty with me.<br> So silence can,<br> according to the circumstances...<br> ...speak.<br> Let us consider now the circumstances<br> of the prisoner's silence.<br> The oath was put to loyal subjects<br> all over the country who all declared...<br> ...His Grace's title to be just and good!<br> But when it came to the prisoner,<br> he refused!<br> He calls this "silence."<br> Yet, is there a man in this court....<br> Is there a man in this country...<br> ...who does not know<br> Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?<br> Yet, how can this be?<br> Because this silence betokened...<br> ...nay, this silence was not silence at all,<br> but most eloquent denial!<br> Not so.<br> Not so, Master Secretary.<br> The maxim of the law is,<br> "Silence gives consent."<br> If, therefore, you wish to construe<br> what my silence betokened...<br> ...you must construe that I consented,<br> not that I denied.<br> Is that in fact what the world<br> construes from it?<br> Do you pretend that is what you wish<br> the world to construe from it?<br> The world must construe<br> according to its wits.<br> This court must construe<br> according to the law.<br> My lords, I wish to call Sir Richard Rich!<br> Richard Rich, come into court.<br> Richard Rich!<br> "l do swear the evidence I'll give<br> before the court shall be the truth...<br> "...the whole truth,<br> and nothing but the truth."<br> "So help me God," sir.<br> "So help me God."<br> Now Rich, on May 12,<br> you were at the Tower?<br> -I was.<br> -For what purpose?<br> I was sent to carry away<br> the prisoner's books.<br> -Did you talk with the prisoner?<br> -Yes.<br> Did you talk of the King's supremacy<br> of the Church?<br> Yes.<br> What did you say?<br> I said to him, "Supposing there were<br> an act of parliament...<br> "...to say that l, Richard Rich,<br> were to be king.<br> "Would not you, Master More,<br> take me for king?"<br> "That I would," he said.<br> "For then you would be king."<br> Yes?<br> Then he said,<br> "But I will put you a higher case.<br> "How, if there were an act of parliament,<br> to say that God should not be God?"<br> -This is true and then you said--<br> -Silence!<br> Continue.<br> But then I said,<br> "l will put you a middle case.<br> "Parliament has made our King<br> Head of the Church.<br> "Why will you not accept him?"<br> Well?<br> And then he said,<br> "Parliament had not the power to do it."<br> Repeat the prisoner's words.<br> He said:<br> "Parliament had not the competence."<br> Or words to that effect.<br> He denied the title!<br> He did.<br> In good faith, Rich,<br> I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.<br> -Do you deny this?<br> -Yes!<br> You know if I were a man<br> who heeded not the taking of an oath...<br> ...I need not be here.<br> Now, I will take an oath.<br> If what Master Rich has said is true...<br> ...I pray I may never see God in the face.<br> Which I would not say, were it otherwise,<br> for anything on earth!<br> -That is not evidence.<br> -ls it probable....<br> Is it probable<br> that after so long a silence on this...<br> ...the very point so urgently sought of me...<br> ...I should open my mind<br> to such a man as that?<br> Sir Richard, do you wish<br> to modify your testimony?<br> No, my lord.<br> Is there anything you wish<br> to take away from it?<br> No, my lord.<br> Have you anything to add?<br> No, my lord.<br> -Have you, Sir Thomas?<br> -To what purpose?<br> I am a dead man.<br> You have your will of me.<br> Then the witness may withdraw.<br> There is one question<br> I would like to ask the witness.<br> That's a chain of office you're wearing.<br> May I see it?<br> The Red Dragon.<br> What's this?<br> Sir Richard is appointed<br> Attorney General for Wales.<br> For Wales.<br> Why Richard, it profits a man nothing<br> to give his soul for the whole world.<br> But for Wales.<br> My lords! I've done.<br> The jury will retire<br> and consider the evidence.<br> Considering the evidence, it shouldn't<br> be necessary for them to retire.<br> Is it necessary?<br> Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?<br> Guilty, my lord!<br> Sir Thomas More,<br> you have been found guilty of high treason.<br> -The sentence of the court--<br> -My lords!<br> When I was practising the law,<br> the manner was to ask the prisoner...<br> ...before pronouncing sentence,<br> if he had anything to say.<br> Have you anything to say?<br> Yes.<br> Since the court has determined<br> to condemn me...<br> ...God knoweth how...<br> ...I will now discharge my mind...<br> ...concerning the indictment<br> and the King's title.<br> The indictment is grounded<br> in an act of parliament...<br> ...which is directly repugnant...<br> ...to the law of God and His Holy Church.<br> The supreme government of which<br> no temperable person...<br> ...may by any law<br> presume to take upon him.<br> This was granted...<br> ...by the mouth...<br> ...of our Saviour, Christ Himself...<br> ...to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome<br> whilst He lived...<br> ...and was personally present...<br> ...here on earth.<br> It is therefore insufficient in law...<br> ...to charge any Christian to obey it.<br> And more than this...<br> ...the immunity of the Church is promised<br> both in Magna Carta...<br> ...and in the King's own coronation oath.<br> Now, we plainly see you are malicious!<br> Not so.<br> I am the King's true subject...<br> ...and I pray for him and all the realm.<br> I do none harm.<br> I say none harm.<br> I think none harm.<br> And if this be not enough<br> to keep a man alive...<br> ...then in good faith, I long not to live.<br> Nevertheless...<br> ...it is not for the supremacy<br> that you have sought my blood...<br> ...but because I would not bend<br> to the marriage!<br> You have been found guilty of high treason.<br> The sentence of the court<br> is that you be taken...<br> ...to the Tower of London...<br> ...until the day hence to the appointment...<br> ...for your execution!<br> I am commanded by the King to be brief...<br> ...and since I am<br> the King's obedient subject...<br> ...brief I will be.<br> I die His Majesty's good servant...<br> ...but God's first.<br> I forgive you, right readily.<br> Be not afraid of your office.<br> You send me to God.<br> You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?<br> He will not refuse one who is so blithe<br> to go to him.<br> Thomas More's head was stuck<br> on Traitor's Gate for a month.<br> Then his daughter, Margaret,<br> removed it and kept it 'til her death.<br> Cromwell was beheaded for high treason<br> five years after More.<br> The Archbishop was burned at the stake.<br> The Duke of Norfolk should have<br> been executed for high treason...<br> ...but the King died of syphilis<br> the night before.<br> Richard Rich became<br> Chancellor of England...<br> ...and died in his bed.<br>
