                        First time in India, Miss Quested?<br> - First time out of England.<br> - I envy you. New horizons.<br> Those are the Marabar Caves,<br> about 20 miles from you at Chandrapore.<br> I see.<br> Mrs Moore returns on the Rawalpindi<br> on May 12th and your return is open.<br> That is correct?<br> I'll be staying on... probably.<br> If you decide to return with Mrs Moore,<br> let us know as soon as possible.<br> I will.<br> Now, labels, stickers,<br> your ticket, Mrs Moore's ticket.<br> You should have an interesting voyage.<br> The viceroy's on board.<br> Tends to liven things up.<br> (& military band plays)<br> (cheering)<br> Ugh.<br> I do think it's too bad of Ronny<br> not to be here to meet us.<br> - It is nearly a thousand miles.<br> - We've come 5,000 miles to meet him.<br> "No more than two annas each."<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Now... Victoria Station.<br> (knocking)<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - Mrs Moore?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm Mrs Turton.<br> My husband's the collector.<br> Oh... We gave our tickets<br> to the Indian gentleman.<br> The chief administrator of Chandrapore.<br> Ronny's "Burra Sahib".<br> You must be Adela.<br> Yes.<br> Please forgive us, Mrs Turton.<br> We've had a very trying day.<br> We just wanted to welcome you<br> to the fold and to say... We're off.<br> We must have a drink or something later,<br> when you've recovered. Goodbye.<br> I believe you and Ronny met<br> in the Lake District, Miss Quested?<br> - Yes, we did.<br> - You must forgive me.<br> We have very few secrets in Chandrapore.<br> And I'm an incurable romantic.<br> Miss Quested was with her aunt<br> and I was with Ronny.<br> You know, Mrs Moore, Ronny's<br> doing splendidly. You'll be proud of him.<br> I'll second that.<br> He's become a proper sahib.<br> Just the type we want, if I might say so.<br> (train rumbles)<br> You know, Mr Turton,<br> when we get settled in,<br> we look forward to meeting some of<br> the Indians you come across socially<br> as friends.<br> Well, as a matter of fact,<br> we don't come across them socially.<br> They're full of all the virtues,<br> no doubt, but we don't.<br> East is East, Mrs Moore.<br> It's a question of culture.<br> Could Ronny really have become a sahib?<br> He could.<br> But that's why you've come here.<br> You'll find out soon enough.<br> She's a dreadful woman.<br> Yes.<br> We'd better go to sleep, my dear.<br> (coughing)<br> Hello, Mother! Where's Adela?<br> Here.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Antony!<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> Antony will see to the baggage. Forgive<br> me, I'm part of the reception committee.<br> Guards! Attention!<br> Sorry to desert you. We had to<br> welcome the great man back.<br> - I'd no idea he was so important.<br> - You hadn't?<br> (car horn)<br> (car horn)<br> (hoots repeatedly)<br> Look out!<br> (car horn)<br> - That was Turton.<br> - Turton?<br> (car horn)<br> McBryde. When he first came, Hamidullah<br> said he was quite a good fellow.<br> But they all become exactly the same.<br> I give any Englishman two years.<br> - The women are worse.<br> - I give them six months.<br> Ronny, is that a body?<br> Yes. I'm sorry.<br> We'll soon be out of this.<br> Why do we spend so much time<br> discussing the English?<br> Because we admire them, Doctor Sahib.<br> That is the trouble.<br> Tomorrow night!<br> English!<br> - Here we are, then.<br> - Very nice, dear.<br> - Are those the Marabar Hills?<br> - That's right.<br> - With the caves?<br> - I suppose so.<br> Look, you've got a busy day tomorrow.<br> Then we have a show at the club.<br> - Come on. Let's have tea.<br> - Yes.<br> (Ronny) Good night, Mother.<br> - (knocking)<br> - Yes?<br> - Good night, dear.<br> - Good night.<br> Having listened to the evidence,<br> I find you guilty of cheating<br> under Section 415<br> of the Indian Penal Code<br> and sentence you<br> to two months' hard labour.<br> You may take the prisoner down.<br> - Well, how did it all go?<br> - We must have seen everything.<br> Yes, the church, the hospital,<br> the war memorial, the barracks.<br> - Mr Hadley was most thorough.<br> - Splendid. And now you're off to the club.<br> Cucumber.<br> My dear, life rarely gives us what we want<br> at the moment we consider appropriate.<br> Adventures do occur,<br> but not punctually.<br> Doctor Sahib, when are we<br> going to get you married?<br> I have enough responsibilities, Auntie.<br> We ask the poor fellow to dinner,<br> avail ourselves of his professional skills,<br> - and you always bring up this question.<br> - It is the least I can do.<br> This should put a stop to the trouble.<br> And, Begum Sahiba, I beg you once more<br> not to drink water out of a tap.<br> Please to boil it, boil it, boil it!<br> And now we can eat. Selim!<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> Why must you always bring up<br> this question of marriage?<br> He sends the children nearly all his salary<br> and lives like a low-grade clerk.<br> What more do you require?<br> This chitty has just arrived for you<br> from Major Callendar.<br> I am to report to his bungalow posthaste.<br> And my bicycle has a puncture.<br> The major sahib left half an hour ago.<br> - And left no message?<br> - No message.<br> Mrs Lesley, it is a tonga. Come!<br> Oh, how splendid.<br> I suppose this is all right?<br> My dear, never look a gift-horse in<br> the mouth, particularly in this country.<br> Club!<br> Club, tonga wallah! Club!<br> Why doesn't the fool move?<br> I pay you tomorrow.<br> (women giggle)<br> Will you please...<br> (rustling)<br> (leaves rustling)<br> Madam, this is a mosque.<br> You have no right here.<br> - You should have taken off your shoes.<br> - But I have taken off my shoes.<br> I left them outside.<br> Then I... I ask your pardon.<br> - Let me go.<br> - Madam.<br> I am right, am I not?<br> If I remove my shoes, I am allowed?<br> Of course.<br> But so few ladies take the trouble.<br> Especially if thinking<br> no one is here to see.<br> God is here.<br> God is here.<br> That is very fine.<br> May I know your name?<br> Mrs Moore.<br> Oh.<br> I came from the club.<br> They're doing a rather tiresome<br> musical play I'd seen in London.<br> - It was very hot.<br> - I think you ought not to walk alone.<br> There are bad characters about,<br> and leopards may come from the hills.<br> - Snakes also.<br> - But you walk alone.<br> - I come here quite often. I'm used to it.<br> - Used to snakes?<br> I'm a doctor, you see.<br> Snakes don't dare bite me.<br> Please.<br> Mrs Moore, I think you are<br> newly arrived in India.<br> Yes. How did you know?<br> By the way you address me.<br> Look.<br> Sometimes I have seen a dead body<br> float past from Benares.<br> But not very often.<br> - There are crocodiles.<br> - Crocodiles?<br> How terrible.<br> What a terrible river.<br> What a wonderful river.<br> Please may I ask you a question now?<br> Why do you come to India?<br> I come to visit my son.<br> He's the city magistrate.<br> Oh, no. Excuse me.<br> Our city magistrate is Mr Heaslop.<br> He is my son all the same.<br> I was married twice.<br> And your first husband died?<br> He did. And so did my second.<br> Then we are in the same box.<br> And is the city magistrate<br> the entire of your family now?<br> No. I have a daughter in England by my<br> second husband. Stella. She's an artist.<br> Ah.<br> Mrs Moore, like yourself,<br> I have also a son and a daughter.<br> Is not this the same box<br> with a vengeance?<br> But not called Ronny and Stella, surely?<br> No indeed. Akbar and Jamila.<br> They live with my wife's mother.<br> And your wife?<br> In giving me a son, she died.<br> You have the most kind face<br> of any English lady I have met.<br> I think I'd better go back now.<br> & I've got this strange feeling<br> I've fallen in love<br> - & She's fallen in love?<br> - & While I was freewheeling<br> And...<br> & Hooray, hooray, hooray<br> & It's a wonderful day today<br> & But I know that at this juncture<br> & I can't afford a puncture<br> & And here is my Michael...<br> I wish I were a member.<br> I could have asked you in.<br> Indians are not allowed.<br> Oh.<br> Good night.<br> There you are.<br> What have you been up to?<br> I'll tell you about it later.<br> I had a small adventure,<br> and saw the moon in the Ganges.<br> Ah, Mrs Moore, Miss Quested,<br> have a drink. Have two drinks.<br> - It's very kind.<br> - My wife's on stage,<br> and Ronny's still holding<br> the fort for Major Callendar.<br> His wretched Indian assistant didn't<br> turn up in time, but I got my own back.<br> I'm sorry about the show.<br> But what else can we do for you ladies?<br> Mr Turton, I'm longing to see<br> something of the real India.<br> Fielding, how is one to see the real India?<br> Try seeing Indians.<br> - Who was that?<br> - Our schoolmaster. Government College.<br> As if one could avoid seeing them.<br> Well, I've scarcely spoken to<br> an Indian since we landed.<br> Lucky you!<br> If you really want to meet<br> some of our Aryan brothers,<br> how about a bridge party?<br> - Not the game.<br> - Oh...<br> No. A party to bridge the gulf<br> between East and West.<br> We can produce almost any type you like:<br> Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, even a Parsee.<br> (drum roll)<br> & God save our gracious king<br> & Long live our noble king<br> & God save the king<br> & Send him victorious<br> & Happy and glorious...<br> (& band plays "Tea for Two")<br> To work, Molly. To work.<br> I never thought so many would turn up.<br> They hate it as much as we do.<br> Ronny.<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> Very nice of you to come.<br> Would you please tell these ladies<br> I wish we could speak their language?<br> - Perhaps we speak yours a little.<br> - Why, fancy, she understands!<br> - Piccadilly, Hyde Park Corner.<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> - Rotten Row.<br> - Marble Arch.<br> - She knows Paris also.<br> - They pass Paris on the way, no doubt.<br> (& "Roses of Picardy")<br> My only consolation<br> is that Mrs Turton will soon be retired<br> to a villa in Tunbridge Wells.<br> Who is that man talking to Adela?<br> Oh, that's Fielding.<br> Runs Government College.<br> I don't understand people inviting guests<br> and not treating them properly.<br> You and Mr Turton are the only people<br> who've made any attempt to be friendly.<br> It makes me quite ashamed.<br> It's awkward, I agree, here at the club.<br> I envy you being with Indians.<br> If you and Mrs Moore would care<br> to meet one or two, it's easily arranged.<br> I'd love to. I'm sure she would too.<br> We've an old Hindu professor who'll tell<br> you all about reincarnation and destiny.<br> - He might even be persuaded to sing.<br> - I'd like that.<br> - Tell me, do you know a Dr Aziz?<br> - I know of him. I've never actually met.<br> Mrs Moore says he's charming.<br> - Good. We'll invite him too.<br> - Good.<br> Oh, dear. This is for Mrs Turton.<br> (& "In a Monastery Garden"<br> by Albert Ketlbey)<br> This is one of the most unnatural affairs<br> I have ever attended.<br> Of course it's unnatural.<br> Now you see.<br> I do not see why you all behave<br> so unpleasantly to these people.<br> - We're not out here to be pleasant.<br> - Ronny, what do you mean?<br> India isn't a drawing room. We're out here<br> to do justice and to keep the peace.<br> I'm not a missionary<br> or a sentimental socialist.<br> - I'm just a member of the civil service.<br> - As simple as that.<br> What do you and Adela want me to do?<br> Sacrifice my career?<br> Lose the power I have<br> for doing good in this country?<br> Good? You're speaking about power.<br> The whole of this entertainment<br> is an exercise in power,<br> and the subtle pleasures<br> of personal superiority.<br> (& band plays "God Save the King")<br> God has put us on earth<br> to love and help our fellow men.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> Mr Fielding?<br> (water running)<br> - Mr Fielding.<br> - Oh, hello. Is that Dr Aziz?<br> Yes. I'm afraid I am early.<br> That's fine. I won't be a jiffy.<br> Please make yourself at home.<br> May I really, Mr Fielding?<br> It's very good of you.<br> - Mr Fielding!<br> - Yes?<br> I have long been wanting to meet you.<br> I have heard many times about<br> your kind heart and your sociability.<br> My dear fellow!<br> And I have seen you in the bazaar.<br> Ah.<br> (Fielding hums "The Sun, Whose Rays<br> are all Ablaze" by Gilbert & Sullivan)<br> & The sun, whose rays are all ablaze<br> with ever-living glory<br> & Does not deny his majesty,<br> he scorns to tell a story...<br> - I say, Mr Fielding.<br> - Yes?<br> Before you come out,<br> guess what I look like.<br> Well, let's see.<br> You're about 5ft 9in tall.<br> - Jolly good!<br> - I can see that much through the glass.<br> Blast!<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - I've just broken my back collar stud.<br> Oh. Take mine.<br> Have you a spare one?<br> Yes. Yes, one minute.<br> - Not if you're wearing it.<br> - No, no. Here in my pocket.<br> But nobody carries<br> a spare stud in his pocket.<br> I always, in case of emergency.<br> Here it is.<br> Many thanks.<br> Oh, and how do you do?<br> Sit down while I finish dressing,<br> if you don't mind the unconventionality.<br> I always thought Englishmen<br> kept their rooms so tidy.<br> Everything arranged coldly<br> on shelves is what I thought.<br> There are two English ladies<br> coming to tea to meet you.<br> - Oh.<br> - Oh, I think you know one of them.<br> - I know no English ladies.<br> - Not Mrs Moore?<br> - Mrs Moore?<br> - And Miss Quested, her companion.<br> Oh. Is she an old lady?<br> She's a young lady,<br> and she wants to see India.<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> They're here,<br> or will be in a few seconds.<br> I've also asked our professor<br> of philosophy, Narayan Godbole.<br> Oh, the inscrutable Brahmin.<br> I hope to goodness his food'll be<br> all right. He's orthodox, you know.<br> (Fielding) Good afternoon. Welcome.<br> - (Mrs Moore) How kind of you to ask us.<br> - (Miss Quested) Nice to meet you.<br> Oh.<br> It must have been a small audience hall.<br> Mrs Moore, do you remember<br> the tank in our mosque?<br> - I do indeed.<br> - Please come and see.<br> By a skilful arrangement of our emperors,<br> the same water comes and fills this tank.<br> My ancestors loved water.<br> We came out of the desert.<br> We came over from<br> Persia and Afghanistan.<br> And wherever we went, we created<br> fountains and gardens and...<br> Ah, Godbole! You know Dr Aziz,<br> and here are our new visitors.<br> Mrs Moore, Miss Quested, Professor<br> Godbole. We didn't realise you were here.<br> The sun will soon be driving us<br> all into the shade.<br> And I was enjoying the water.<br> Now, Mrs Moore, would you like<br> to have our tea served inside or out?<br> Dr Aziz, I wonder if you could explain<br> a disappointment we had this morning.<br> Ah, yes. I'm afraid we may have<br> given some offence.<br> That is impossible. May I know the facts?<br> Yes. An Indian lady and gentleman, whom<br> we met at the club party the other day,<br> were to collect us in their carriage<br> this morning at nine.<br> We waited and waited.<br> They never came.<br> They even put off<br> going to Delhi to entertain us.<br> - I wouldn't worry about it.<br> - Well, it is very worrying.<br> I think perhaps, young lady,<br> they grew ashamed of their house<br> - and that is why they did not send.<br> - That's very possible.<br> - I do so hate mysteries.<br> - We English do.<br> I rather like mysteries,<br> but I do dislike muddles.<br> I think a mystery is only<br> a high-sounding term for a muddle.<br> The professor, Aziz and I<br> know that India's a muddle.<br> Agreed, I'm sorry to say.<br> There will be no muddle<br> when you come to visit me at my house.<br> That would be very nice. Yes, Adela?<br> Yes, indeed. Do please give me<br> your address, Doctor Aziz.<br> - Yes?<br> - One moment. I have a better idea.<br> Let me invite you all<br> to a picnic at the Marabar Caves.<br> Ladies, this will be<br> a most magnificent outing.<br> One is transported by mountain railway<br> And the caves, Mrs Moore,<br> are a wonder of India.<br> - Yes, Professor?<br> - They have a reputation.<br> Doctor, how many caves are there?<br> I'm not exactly sure. Unfortunately,<br> I've never been there myself.<br> My dear chap!<br> Professor Godbole,<br> have you seen the caves?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Well, could you tell us<br> something about them?<br> With pleasure.<br> Only a few have been opened.<br> Perhaps seven or eight.<br> And?<br> There is an entrance which you enter,<br> and through this entrance, manmade,<br> there is a circular chamber.<br> - Big?<br> - Not big.<br> - Immensely holy, no doubt?<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> Ornamented in some way?<br> They are all the same. Empty and dark.<br> Well, there must be something<br> to account for their reputation.<br> Indeed.<br> Well, well.<br> Mr Fielding, I should like<br> to see something of the college.<br> Don't you come, Adela.<br> I know you hate institutions.<br> You know, Miss Quested, when I first<br> saw Mrs Moore it was in the moonlight.<br> I thought she was a ghost.<br> - A very old soul.<br> - An old soul?<br> The professor is using<br> the expression in its Hindu sense.<br> Someone who has been here<br> many times before.<br> - Mrs Moore - a reincarnation?<br> - Quite so.<br> - Please go on, Professor.<br> - Ah, yes.<br> - It is philosophy of some complication.<br> - But in simple terms...<br> In simple terms, Miss Quested,<br> life is a wheel with many spokes.<br> A continuous cycle of life:<br> birth, death and rebirth<br> until we attain nirvana.<br> I have contrived a dance<br> based on this philosophy.<br> Do you dance, Professor?<br> - Adela.<br> - Oh, Ronny, you're early.<br> Let me introduce to you<br> Professor Godbole and this...<br> What's happened to Fielding?<br> And what on earth are you doing?<br> They're seeing the college and<br> we're eating water chestnuts. Have one.<br> No, thank you. We're leaving at once.<br> - But we can't leave like this.<br> - It's perfectly all right.<br> Bearer! Bearer!<br> (train whistle)<br> You can take it from me<br> that picnic will never come off.<br> Just like that fiasco this morning.<br> He'll forget he invited you.<br> - You're wrong.<br> - Notice the collar climbing up his neck?<br> I like Dr Aziz.<br> Aziz was dressed in his Sunday best,<br> but he'd forgotten his back collar stud.<br> And there you have the Indian all over.<br> I bet he forgot the caves<br> are miles from the station.<br> - Have you been to them?<br> - I know all about them, naturally.<br> - Naturally.<br> - I really cannot have this quarrelling.<br> Sorry.<br> I don't know why I get so het up.<br> Actually, I was taking us all<br> to see a game of polo. Should be good.<br> Not for me, dear. I'm going to rest.<br> You and Adela can watch the polo.<br> - Ronny.<br> - Yes?<br> - I want to say something.<br> - Yes?<br> Something important.<br> Ronny...<br> I've finally decided...<br> we're not going to be married.<br> You never said we would be married.<br> But you were quite right to come out.<br> It was a good idea.<br> We're being awfully English<br> about this, aren't we?<br> I suppose that's all right.<br> As we are English, yes, I suppose it is.<br> Let's go for a little drive.<br> - Oughtn't we get back to the bungalow?<br> - Why?<br> I think we should tell your mother,<br> talk about what we're going to do.<br> If you don't mind,<br> let's leave it a day or two.<br> I don't want to upset her<br> any more than I have.<br> And besides,<br> you're going on that expedition.<br> And why did you undertake<br> such an extravagance?<br> To avoid asking them to my house.<br> Which you had already done.<br> Now we must all put<br> our shoulders to the wheel.<br> My wife will supply plates,<br> knives and forks.<br> And then there is the question of alcohol.<br> Whisky-sodas for Mr Fielding,<br> ports for the ladies.<br> And food. The English are big eaters.<br> - And Professor Godbole?<br> - He eats more than the English.<br> - Nothing but vegetables, fruits and rice.<br> - And only if cooked by a Brahmin.<br> And if there is a slice of beef<br> in the vicinity, he will throw up.<br> The English can eat mutton.<br> - Even ham.<br> - Ham? Are you suggesting I offer ham?<br> Enough, enough.<br> English ladies cannot sit upon the ground.<br> Not even on a Persian carpet.<br> - You must take chairs and tables.<br> - So you will need servants.<br> Then there is also the question<br> of transport after the train journey.<br> The caves are a considerable<br> distance from the station.<br> I've just been to the station.<br> The train leaves before dawn.<br> Then you must take precaution<br> against lack of punctuality.<br> Better spend the night there.<br> - What was that?<br> - Nothing.<br> It always happens before the hot weather,<br> generally with dust and thunder. Coffee?<br> No, thank you. I'm off to bed.<br> I know I made myself<br> rather ridiculous this afternoon.<br> But the truth is, I wasn't<br> quite sure of myself, and I'm sorry.<br> Very nicely said. Thank you, dear.<br> Of course, I have no earthly right to tell<br> either of you what you can or cannot do.<br> See India if you like and as you like.<br> Sometimes I think too much fuss<br> is made about marriage.<br> Century after century<br> of carnal embracement,<br> and we're still no nearer<br> understanding one another.<br> Good night.<br> (dogs barking)<br> (bicycle bell)<br> Adela, are you all right?<br> Yes, of course.<br> - Well, what happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> I want to take back what I said at the polo.<br> Oh, Ronny... I'm such a fool.<br> (& orchestra plays "Oh, Lady Be Good")<br> It's a funny thing,<br> but I don't feel a bit excited.<br> Well, nothing's really changed, has it?<br> I feel perfectly ordinary.<br> It's much the best feeling to have.<br> I suppose so.<br> I'm sorry to have been so difficult.<br> Oh, I shouldn't worry.<br> It's partly to do with this country<br> and the odd surroundings.<br> Do you mean that my bothers<br> are to do with India?<br> India forces one to come<br> face to face with oneself.<br> It can be rather disturbing.<br> Odd.<br> It must be very cold in England.<br> Now we must go back<br> and you must dance with Ronny.<br> Apart from anything else,<br> it will serve as a notice of intent.<br> Hello.<br> (rumble of thunder)<br> (groans)<br> Hassan.<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> - It's going to be hot.<br> - Your famous hot weather.<br> - Mother?<br> - You two go ahead.<br> Ah!<br> Congratulations.<br> We've just heard the good news.<br> Allow me to shake your hand.<br> Mr Fielding, I'm Dr Lal.<br> - Ah, yes. How do you do?<br> - Just making check on doctor sahib.<br> - Major Callendar's orders.<br> - And?<br> A slight fever, perhaps.<br> Change of season.<br> - You must get well quickly.<br> - Yes. There is talk of cholera in the city.<br> There is always talk of cholera in the city.<br> Hello! Can I come in?<br> Mr Fielding. Yes, please come in.<br> Ah.<br> - Hamidullah.<br> - Mr Fielding, how nice of you to come.<br> - And how's the patient?<br> - It is very good of Mr Fielding<br> to condescend to visit our friend.<br> We're deeply touched.<br> Don't talk to him like that.<br> He does not want it.<br> And he does not need three chairs.<br> He's not three Englishmen!<br> Well, are you ill or aren't you?<br> No doubt Major Callendar<br> told you I'm shamming.<br> Well, are you?<br> The hot weather is coming.<br> I have a fever.<br> Sit down, sit down.<br> Sit down, all of you!<br> Mr Fielding, excuse. A question, please.<br> - Carry on.<br> - Nothing personal.<br> Personally, we're all delighted<br> that you should be here.<br> But how is England<br> justified in holding India?<br> - Unfair political question.<br> - No, no.<br> - I'm out here because I need a job.<br> - Qualified Indians also need a job.<br> I got in first.<br> And I'm delighted to be here. That's<br> my answer and that's my only excuse.<br> - And those who are not delighted?<br> - Chuck 'em out.<br> Indians are also saying that.<br> - (speaks Urdu)<br> - Mr Fielding...<br> What are you doing out here?<br> Please come back.<br> Of course.<br> Here you see the celebrated<br> hospitality of the East.<br> Look... look at the mess.<br> Look at the flies.<br> - Look at the plaster coming off the wall.<br> - Oh, please.<br> Here is my home,<br> where you come to be insulted<br> by my friends.<br> That was fair enough.<br> And you'd better get back into bed.<br> - And then you'll have to be off.<br> - You should rest.<br> I can rest all day thanks to Dr Lal,<br> Major Callendar's spy.<br> I suppose you know that.<br> Major Callendar doesn't trust anyone,<br> English or Indian. That's his character.<br> I wish you weren't under him.<br> But you are, and that's that.<br> There we are. Try sleeping for a bit.<br> Before you go, will you please open<br> that drawer under the clock?<br> There's a grey cardboard folder.<br> That's right. Open it.<br> She was my wife.<br> You are the first Englishman<br> she has ever come before.<br> Now put her away.<br> I don't know why you pay me this<br> great compliment, but I do appreciate it.<br> Oh, it is nothing. She was not a highly<br> educated woman, or even beautiful.<br> But I loved her.<br> Now put her away.<br> You would have seen her anyhow.<br> - Would you have allowed me to see her?<br> - Why not?<br> I believe in the purdah, but I would<br> have told her you were my brother.<br> - Would she have believed you?<br> - Of course not.<br> Put her away. She is dead.<br> I showed her to you because<br> I have nothing else to show.<br> Mr Fielding, why are you not married?<br> The lady I liked wouldn't marry me.<br> That's the main point.<br> That was a long time ago.<br> Before the war.<br> - You haven't any children?<br> - None.<br> Excuse the following question.<br> Have you any illegitimate children?<br> No.<br> - Then your name will die entirely out?<br> - Right.<br> This is what an Oriental<br> will never understand.<br> - There are far too many children anyway.<br> - Why don't you marry Miss Quested?<br> - Good Lord!<br> - But she's very nice.<br> I can't marry her even if I wanted to.<br> She's engaged to the city magistrate.<br> Oh.<br> So no Miss Quested for Mr Fielding.<br> However, she is not beautiful,<br> and she has practically no breasts.<br> For a magistrate they may be sufficient.<br> For you I'll arrange a lady<br> with breasts like Bombay mangoes!<br> No, you won't.<br> You must not tell Callendar, but last year<br> I took sick leave and I went to Calcutta.<br> - There are girls there with breasts...<br> - You've made a remarkable recovery.<br> - I have, I have.<br> - Please tell your chap to bring my horse.<br> - He doesn't seem to understand my Urdu.<br> - I told him not to.<br> But now I will release you. Hassan!<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> By the way, about this Marabar<br> expedition. It's going to cost an awful lot.<br> Would you like me to help you call it off?<br> No, no. Arrangements<br> are almost complete.<br> I shall know exact date tomorrow.<br> Well, good. Don't leave it too long.<br> Phew.<br> Hassan?<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> (train whistle)<br> You've come after all! I was afraid...<br> How kind, how very kind!<br> I'm sorry, Dr Aziz, but I've never been<br> at my best at this time of the morning.<br> - We're here anyway.<br> - Yes. Excuse me. Please come.<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> - This isn't all for us?<br> - For this great occasion<br> I've had help from all my friends.<br> I think you will not need your servant.<br> - No, indeed.<br> - Then we shall all be Muslims together.<br> Antony...<br> I don't like him at all.<br> Antony, you can go now.<br> We won't need you any more.<br> Master told me to stay.<br> Mistress tells you to go.<br> Master says<br> "Keep near ladies all morning."<br> Please go.<br> - What's that for?<br> - A surprise. You will see.<br> Come, come, come. Please, come.<br> You are travelling purdah.<br> You will like that?<br> - It will certainly be a new experience.<br> - Yes.<br> Where's Mr Fielding?<br> He'll be here.<br> Englishmen never miss a train.<br> Mr Fielding! Mr Fielding!<br> I'm most awfully sorry, Aziz.<br> Oh, Mr Fielding, you have destroyed me.<br> It was Godbole's prayers.<br> They went on for ever.<br> - Jump on! Jump!<br> - No, no.<br> - I must have you.<br> - I'm sorry, Aziz, but it really is no good.<br> We'll join you... somehow.<br> Mrs Moore, our expedition is a ruin.<br> Nonsense.<br> We shall now all be Muslims together.<br> - Dear, dear Mrs Moore.<br> - Go back to you carriage, Dr Aziz.<br> You make me quite giddy.<br> Poor Aziz.<br> We must try and get hold of a car.<br> Can you think of anyone?<br> Is anything the matter?<br> - You saw the gates shut against us?<br> - Yes.<br> - Today is Tuesday.<br> - Go on.<br> Not a wise day<br> to undertake such a journey.<br> Extremely inauspicious, Mr Fielding.<br> Godbole.<br> I wouldn't have missed this for anything.<br> - Memsahib.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Tea coming.<br> - Yes.<br> What a relief after Antony.<br> Rather a strange place to do the cooking.<br> I always feel rather embarrassed<br> when people I dislike are good to me.<br> And I really don't care for Mrs Callendar.<br> But she's visiting a clinic and<br> the road goes up to just below the caves.<br> We'd better leave in half an hour.<br> Would you care for a coffee?<br> - Miss Quested!<br> - Oh, no.<br> Is Mrs Moore awake?<br> Yes. But please... go in!<br> Don't worry, Miss Quested.<br> Look, I am Douglas Fairbanks.<br> Tell me, dear. What's going on out there?<br> Mrs Moore, we're almost there.<br> I will now explain to you about the ladder.<br> It is to be your big surprise.<br> You cannot imagine how you honour me.<br> I feel that I am journeying back into<br> my past, and that I'm a Mogul emperor.<br> Sometimes I shut my eyes and dream...<br> I have splendid clothes again.<br> And that I'm riding into battle<br> behind Alamgir. He too rode an elephant.<br> Horrid, stuffy place, really.<br> - Everything is very well arranged.<br> - And here, ladies, is your port.<br> The best caves are higher up,<br> under the Kawa Dol.<br> But we start in this one.<br> The guide says,<br> everyone to go in quietly.<br> All sounds make an echo, and many<br> sounds create inharmonious effect.<br> I do hope I shall be all right.<br> In my early days with Ronny's father,<br> I made rather a fool of myself<br> in the chamber of horrors.<br> Horrors? What horrors?<br> The waxwork museum.<br> He was a very conventional young man,<br> which made it all rather worse.<br> - This was not Stella's father?<br> - No, no.<br> He was very unconventional.<br> My goodness me...<br> Sahib, sahib.<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> Hassan! Selim!<br> (baby cries)<br> (echo)<br> Shh. Shh.<br> (echo dies away)<br> (intensifying rumble)<br> Kawa Dol.<br> (echo)<br> (rumble)<br> Mrs Moore!<br> (echo)<br> Please, please.<br> (rumble)<br> (voices)<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yes.<br> Godbole never mentioned the echo.<br> No. And far too many people.<br> - Would you like something to drink?<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> I suppose, like many old people,<br> I sometimes think<br> we are merely passing figures<br> in a godless universe.<br> Get me some water.<br> Oh.<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you, my dear.<br> I didn't know you'd gone. Now, now.<br> We should be thinking of moving on<br> before the sun gets too high.<br> Do forgive me, Dr Aziz.<br> I'm rather tired, so I think I'll stay here.<br> I've never been a good walker, and you<br> two will get on much better without me.<br> Dear Mrs Moore, nothing to forgive.<br> You're right. It is quite a big climb.<br> And I'm glad you're not coming,<br> because you're treating me<br> with true frankness, as a friend.<br> I am your friend.<br> - So may I make a suggestion?<br> - Of course.<br> Don't take quite so many people with you<br> this time. You'll find it more convenient.<br> - It does get rather crowded.<br> - Exactly, exactly.<br> We shall take just the guide. Right?<br> Quite right. And enjoy yourselves.<br> It's almost a mirage.<br> Dr Aziz,<br> may I ask you something<br> rather personal?<br> - You were married, weren't you?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> Did you love your wife<br> when you married her?<br> We never set eyes on each other<br> until the day we were married.<br> It was all arranged by our families.<br> I only saw her face in a photograph.<br> What about love?<br> We were a man and a woman.<br> And we were young.<br> Dr Aziz,<br> did you have more than one wife?<br> One. One, in my case.<br> I'll be back in a moment.<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> - Miss Quested!<br> - (echo)<br> (rumble)<br> Miss Quested!<br> Miss Quested?<br> Miss Quested?<br> (rumble)<br> - What's happened?<br> - Elephant taking bath, memsahib.<br> Something else.<br> (sobs)<br> Miss Quested!<br> Miss Quested!<br> Miss Quested!<br> Miss Quested?<br> Fool!<br> (car horn)<br> - Morning, Mrs Moore.<br> - Mr Fielding.<br> So sorry about this morning.<br> Everything going well?<br> Have you seen Miss Quested and Dr Aziz?<br> No. I've just walked up from the road.<br> I'm dying for a drink.<br> Be with you in a moment.<br> Good Lord!<br> Oh, Mr Fielding, I'm so glad you're here.<br> Oh, I was coming over to you.<br> Nothing wrong?<br> Not exactly. But they went off with<br> the guide an hour ago - more, in fact -<br> and somehow...<br> I don't know this place,<br> but I'm sure they'll be back soon.<br> Fielding! Fielding!<br> Fielding. Fielding, I've so wanted you.<br> - Where is Miss Quested?<br> - What is it?<br> She went down the road.<br> I think she met Mrs Callendar.<br> - It looked like her car.<br> - Of course it was her car.<br> - She drove me here.<br> - Oh.<br> Why did Miss Quested<br> go off with Mrs Callendar?<br> I don't know.<br> But, Dr Aziz, when did you part with her?<br> I don't understand.<br> Nor do I. I went round the corner<br> to have a cigarette...<br> And?<br> Then the guide couldn't recall<br> which cave she'd gone into.<br> So I looked in all the caves,<br> and when I came out of...<br> I think it was the third cave,<br> I... I saw these.<br> And then - I think it was then -<br> I heard the car.<br> So I ran over to the edge<br> and I saw Miss Quested getting in.<br> And... and then she drove away<br> with Mrs Callendar.<br> That's all.<br> And these.<br> I think we'd all better go back.<br> Oh, Mrs Moore...<br> Our great day is in tatters.<br> I will never forgive myself.<br> Hassan!<br> Selim!<br> Aziz is an innocent.<br> Something else must have happened.<br> Of course something else happened.<br> This is a dangerous place<br> for new arrivals.<br> (sobbing)<br> Now lie back, dear.<br> Do your best to relax.<br> You'll be better very soon now.<br> After we've seen off Mrs Moore, I'm going<br> to take you back for a good stiff drink.<br> Here we are.<br> Good Lord, quite a crowd.<br> Dr Aziz, it is my painful duty to arrest you.<br> - What on earth are you talking about?<br> - Sir, I am instructed not to say.<br> Produce your warrant.<br> Sir, excuse me. No warrant is required<br> under these particular circumstances.<br> - Please refer to Superintendent McBryde.<br> - We certainly will.<br> Come along, old chap.<br> Some ridiculous mistake.<br> Dr Aziz, will you please come?<br> A closed conveyance is in the yard.<br> For God's sake!<br> Never, never act the criminal.<br> McBryde's a decent fellow.<br> We'll see him together.<br> But my children, my name...<br> Nothing of the sort.<br> We're coming, Mr Haq.<br> - What is it?<br> - Come. I've got a car waiting outside.<br> That's Mr Fielding's<br> and Dr Aziz's compartment.<br> - I'll explain outside.<br> - I can't leave without speaking to them.<br> Please come along, Mother.<br> I know what I'm doing. Make way, please!<br> Come on.<br> Take my arm. I'll see you through.<br> Fielding!<br> Fielding, I want a word with you.<br> Please... Please don't leave me.<br> I have to go. I'll be with you<br> as soon as I possibly can.<br> - Please, Mother, come along.<br> - I will not!<br> Something very terrible is happening.<br> - Absolutely impossible. Grotesque.<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> But who brings this infamous charge?<br> Mrs Callendar, who witnessed<br> the poor girl's flight down the ravine,<br> and the victim herself.<br> Miss Quested accuses<br> Dr Aziz of attempted rape?<br> - Yes.<br> - Then she's mad.<br> - I cannot pass that remark.<br> - I'm sorry, sir.<br> But the charge must rest on<br> some dreadful misunderstanding.<br> - Five minutes will clear it up.<br> - It does rest on a misunderstanding.<br> I've had 25 years' experience here. I have<br> never known anything but disaster result<br> when English and Indians<br> attempt to be intimate.<br> (door slams)<br> Oh, I hate these damned festivals.<br> I'll be glad when it's over.<br> Always have a feeling<br> they might go over the top.<br> You have a visitor.<br> I think I'll be off. See you tonight.<br> She hit him with these.<br> That's how she escaped.<br> If he had assaulted her, he'd scarcely<br> bring the evidence back with him.<br> - Doesn't surprise me.<br> - I don't follow.<br> When you think of crime,<br> you think of English crime.<br> The psychology's different here.<br> And particularly in regard to women.<br> I've been going through his wallet.<br> Here's a letter from a friend<br> who apparently keeps a brothel.<br> I don't want to hear his private letters.<br> It'll have to be quoted in court<br> as bearing on his morals.<br> Our respectable young doctor<br> was fixing up to see tarts in Calcutta.<br> Oh, come on.<br> You may have the right to throw stones<br> for that sort of thing, but I haven't.<br> - Tell them to wait.<br> - Sir.<br> Aye, it starts already.<br> Vakil Hamidullah and Mahmoud Ali,<br> legal advisors to the prisoner.<br> Where is Miss Quested now?<br> Staying with the Callendars<br> until she's out of danger.<br> - What danger?<br> - She has a fever.<br> But worse, hundreds of cactus spines<br> are embedded in her arms and legs.<br> There's a danger of them<br> entering the bloodstream.<br> Yes.<br> Her scramble down that ravine<br> was so precipitate<br> it started a small avalanche of stones<br> which stopped Mrs Callendar's car.<br> She hooted, thinking work was<br> going on above, and then she saw her.<br> She had got among some cactuses<br> and was beginning to panic.<br> I suppose there's no possibility<br> of my seeing Miss Quested?<br> She's in no state to see anyone.<br> Callendar's sedated her and proposes<br> to keep her like that for days.<br> - He's worried about shock.<br> - I see. But afterwards?<br> Why on earth do you want to see her?<br> I want to ask her if she's certain,<br> dead certain, that it was Aziz.<br> Callendar could ask her that.<br> I want someone who<br> believes in him to ask her.<br> What difference would that make?<br> She is surrounded by people<br> who don't trust Indians.<br> Look, I don't want to be an alarmist,<br> but, in my opinion, the situation will<br> become very nasty in the next few weeks.<br> I would think so.<br> May I see Aziz?<br> Only on a magistrate's order.<br> - To whom do I apply?<br> - The city magistrate.<br> Nothing else excepting clothes, sir.<br> But these were under the bed.<br> - Very useful, Haq.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> And there is also that.<br> - That's his wife.<br> - How do you know that?<br> He showed me that photograph.<br> She's dead.<br> I see. Well, I must press on<br> with the report.<br> I hope to see you at the club on Saturday.<br> I believe Turton wants us all there.<br> You are very good to greet us<br> in this public fashion.<br> For goodness sake.<br> Did Mr McBryde say anything<br> when my card came in?<br> - No.<br> - I'm wanting bail.<br> - Did my application annoy him?<br> - He wasn't annoyed.<br> - And if he was, what does it matter?<br> - I might prejudice him against Aziz.<br> Nonsense.<br> This is no way to be thinking.<br> Aziz is innocent, and everything<br> we do must be based on that.<br> Mr Fielding, are you on our side<br> against your own people?<br> It would seem so.<br> I think we'd better go somewhere else.<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> - Who should be counsel for defence?<br> - You, surely.<br> We need someone from a distance,<br> someone who cannot be intimidated.<br> - Have you heard of Amritrao?<br> - Amritrao? The Calcutta man?<br> - A high reputation.<br> - Notoriously anti-British.<br> - Freedom Movement.<br> - That worries me.<br> Amritrao would be regarded<br> as a political challenge.<br> When I saw my friend's<br> private papers carried in just now,<br> in the arms of that police inspector,<br> I said to myself<br> "Amritrao is the man to clear this up."<br> Let's not go too fast. We're bound to win.<br> She'll never be able<br> to substantiate the charges.<br> (whispers) She's been complaining<br> about an echo in her head.<br> - What about the echo?<br> - She can't get rid of it.<br> I don't suppose she ever will.<br> Back in a moment.<br> - Mother, that was unkind.<br> - Unkind? Unkind?<br> What about poor Dr Aziz<br> and those terrible police?<br> - Mother, quiet, please.<br> - I won't be quiet.<br> Aziz is certainly innocent.<br> - You don't know that.<br> - I know about people's characters.<br> It's not the sort of thing he would do.<br> Whatever you think, the case has got<br> to come before a magistrate now.<br> The machinery has started.<br> Yes. She has started the machinery.<br> It will work to its end.<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> - Ah, Godbole.<br> - I see you are in a hurry.<br> I must get out of these things<br> and go back to town.<br> May I speak to you just for a moment?<br> Er, yes. Come in,<br> if you don't mind me changing.<br> I wanted to apologise for this morning.<br> Oh, it's all right.<br> I hope the expedition was successful.<br> - The news hasn't reached you then?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> No. A dreadful thing has happened.<br> Aziz has been arrested.<br> Oh, yes. That is all round the college.<br> An expedition where that occurs<br> can hardly be called successful.<br> - I cannot say. I was not there.<br> - No.<br> I must not detain you,<br> but I have a private difficulty<br> on which I require your help.<br> I'm leaving your service shortly,<br> as you know.<br> I'm returning to the place of my childhood<br> to take charge of education there.<br> I want to start a school that will be<br> as much like this as possible.<br> - Well?<br> - The point on which I desire advice is,<br> what name should be given to the school?<br> - A name for the school?<br> - A suitable title.<br> Godbole, have you grasped<br> that Aziz is in prison?<br> Yes. I only meant that when you're less<br> worried you might think the matter over.<br> I had thought, with your permission,<br> of the Richard Fielding High School.<br> But, failing that,<br> the King Emperor George V.<br> Godbole, let me ask you something. I was<br> under the impression that you liked Aziz.<br> - Most certainly.<br> - Then how can you be so indifferent?<br> - Don't you care what happens to him?<br> - It is of no consequence if I care or not.<br> The outcome is already decided.<br> - Destiny, karma.<br> - Just so.<br> Mr Fielding, we are all part of<br> a pattern we cannot perceive.<br> Why did Mrs Moore bring<br> Miss Quested to Chandrapore?<br> To marry the city magistrate.<br> Yes...<br> Or to go to the Marabar with Dr Aziz.<br> - Or perhaps to meet you.<br> - Very beguiling.<br> But at this moment my only interest<br> is to do something for Aziz.<br> Excuse me, but nothing you do<br> will change the outcome.<br> So do nothing.<br> Is that your philosophy?<br> My philosophy is<br> you can do what you like,<br> but the outcome will be the same.<br> (door opens)<br> Did you get bail?<br> They're afraid your presence<br> might incite further trouble.<br> Even riots.<br> (whispers) We've received<br> a telegram from Calcutta.<br> - From Calcutta?<br> - Amritrao is going to defend you.<br> Amritrao?<br> Read, read.<br> - What is "disbursement"?<br> - Fee. He will not accept a fee.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> (crowd shouting)<br> There's not the least cause for alarm.<br> I want everything to go on<br> precisely as usual.<br> So don't start carrying arms about.<br> Ladies, don't go out<br> any more than you can help,<br> and don't talk before your servants.<br> Remember, one isolated<br> Indian has attempted...<br> has been charged with<br> an attempted crime.<br> And he will be brought to trial.<br> Those drums are merely<br> the festival, of course.<br> Yes, indeed. And no doubt they'll be<br> banging away throughout the night.<br> Apologies, Collector Sahib, everyone.<br> Heaslop's just behind me and<br> I want to say a word before he comes in.<br> - Of course.<br> - He needs all our support.<br> He blames himself<br> for allowing such an expedition,<br> as indeed do I for giving the wretch leave.<br> And then there's his mother.<br> It's been a most unsettling experience.<br> The good news is that the victim<br> is greatly improved and...<br> Ah, Heaslop, come along in.<br> Good to have you with us.<br> For goodness sake, do sit down, please.<br> Up here, Ronny.<br> Come and join us up here.<br> Thank you, sir. Thank you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Please, do sit down.<br> - (man) Some of us never got up.<br> We were delighted to hear<br> the major's report on Miss Quested.<br> Thank you, sir. I didn't mean to<br> interrupt the meeting in this way.<br> Not at all. I was saying<br> before you arrived that you'd refused bail.<br> I was about to add<br> that there's a certain member<br> here present<br> who's known to be in contact<br> with the prisoner's defence.<br> I'd like to say one can't run with the hare<br> and hunt with the hounds.<br> At least, not in this country.<br> - I would like to say something, sir.<br> - Please do.<br> I believe Dr Aziz is innocent.<br> I shall await the verdict of the court.<br> If he is found guilty, I shall resign<br> from the college and leave India.<br> I resign from the club now.<br> She's old. You mustn't forget that.<br> Old people never take things<br> as one expects.<br> They can cause a great deal of trouble.<br> (knocking)<br> - Are you all right, Mother?<br> - Just... just having a little rest.<br> - It's very hot.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> I do wish I could persuade you not to<br> undertake this journey at this time of year.<br> At least stay until the monsoon.<br> It's very close now.<br> So much to do, so little time to do it.<br> To do what, Mother?<br> Settle things up. See Stella.<br> Get away from all this muddle and fuss<br> into some cave of my own, some shelf.<br> Quite so. But meanwhile<br> the trial is coming on.<br> I don't want to have anything to do with it.<br> But you are an important witness.<br> You dropped off after the first cave<br> and let Adela go on with him alone.<br> No one blames you, Mother.<br> He stage-managed the whole thing<br> by frightening you with that echo.<br> Mumbo jumbo, but very effective.<br> You'll never understand<br> the nature of that place,<br> nor will anyone else<br> in that ridiculous court of yours.<br> - I don't wish to discuss it further.<br> - Very well, Mother.<br> Will you at least stay for our marriage?<br> - You are getting married?<br> - Of course. Why do you ask?<br> I wondered.<br> All this rubbish about love.<br> Love in a church, love in a cave,<br> as if there were the least difference.<br> And I held up from my business<br> over such trifles.<br> I don't understand you.<br> I've never understood you<br> any more than you've understood me.<br> But what of Adela?<br> I like Adela. She has character.<br> Then don't you want to help her?<br> Nothing I can say or do<br> will make the least difference.<br> If that is really how you feel,<br> Mother, then you must go.<br> Goodbye.<br> You mustn't upset yourself, my dear.<br> The verdict's a foregone conclusion.<br> It isn't that. I'm all right really.<br> You almost certainly<br> won't be called till tomorrow.<br> McBryde will take up<br> most of the morning.<br> Then there's Amritrao, who'll be up to his<br> tricks and playing to the Indian gallery.<br> (shouting)<br> (smash)<br> Come along, dear. We're there.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I'm an interested party, Mrs Turton.<br> I've handed over to my deputy.<br> - And who is your deputy?<br> - (gavel)<br> Das is a good man, Mrs Turton.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> On April 3rd of this year,<br> Miss Quested and her friend, Mrs Moore,<br> were invited to a tea party at the house<br> of the principal of Government College.<br> It was here that the prisoner first met Miss<br> Quested, a young girl fresh from England.<br> Until then, the prisoner had never been<br> in such close proximity to an English girl.<br> In consideration of the ladies present,<br> I will merely allude you to the fact that the<br> prisoner is a widower, now living alone.<br> And in the course of our evidence,<br> I'll be providing proof of his state of mind.<br> Before taking you through<br> the history of this crime,<br> I want to state what I believe<br> to be a universal truth.<br> The darker races<br> are attracted to the fairer.<br> But not vice versa.<br> Even when the lady<br> is less attractive than the gentleman?<br> - (laughter)<br> - Order! Order!<br> Order! Order!<br> (heartbeat)<br> I must warn members of the public<br> and certain members of the defence<br> that the insulting behaviour<br> which marred yesterday's proceedings<br> will not be tolerated.<br> Well said, Das. Quite right.<br> - Mr McBryde.<br> - Thank you.<br> I shall begin by reminding you<br> of my contention<br> that prisoner proposed the expedition<br> with a premeditated intention<br> of making advances to Miss Quested.<br> I've made it my business to visit<br> the Marabar during the last few days.<br> It's an inaccessible, barren place,<br> entailing, as you have heard, considerable<br> planning and expense to get there.<br> The caves themselves are dark,<br> featureless, and without interest,<br> except for a strange echo.<br> A curious place<br> for such an elaborate picnic.<br> The servants were all supplied<br> by prisoner's Indian friends,<br> with one exception<br> of the witness, Antony.<br> Antony had received explicit instructions<br> from Mr Heaslop to stay with the ladies.<br> Yet he remained behind.<br> Yesterday you heard him admit that he<br> had accepted money from the prisoner<br> minutes before the departure of the train.<br> And that brought us to Mr Fielding.<br> We are asked to believe he was<br> prevented from catching the train<br> because another friend of the prisoner's,<br> Professor Godbole,<br> was saying his prayers.<br> Prayers. After a most unpleasant<br> altercation, I withdrew my hypothesis<br> that similar persuasion had contributed<br> towards this excess of religious zeal.<br> I object, sir.<br> Mr McBryde is quite blatantly using<br> this opportunity to repeat the slander.<br> - Objection sustained!<br> - Ha!<br> (laughter)<br> Order! Order!<br> Order!<br> Prisoner had yet to rid himself<br> of a third impediment.<br> The lady in question<br> suffered from what is known in medical<br> parlance as "claustrophobia".<br> Prisoner achieved his objective<br> by entering a cave with Miss Quested,<br> leaving this elderly lady in the rear,<br> where she was crushed and crowded<br> by servants and villagers.<br> - Mrs Moore. He's speaking of Mrs Moore!<br> - Quiet.<br> Are you accusing my client<br> of attempted murder as well as rape?<br> Who is this lady he's talking about?<br> The lady I met in the mosque. Mrs Moore.<br> Mrs Moore? You speak of Mrs Moore?<br> I don't propose to call her.<br> You don't propose to call her<br> because you can't!<br> She was smuggled out of the country<br> because she was on our side.<br> - She'd have proved his innocence.<br> - You could have called her.<br> Neither side called her,<br> neither may quote her.<br> But she was kept from us!<br> This is English justice?<br> This is your British Raj?<br> Just give us back<br> Mrs Moore for five minutes.<br> If the point is of any interest, my mother<br> should be reaching Aden at noon today.<br> - Banished by you!<br> - Please, please.<br> - This is no way to defend your case.<br> - I'm not defending a case.<br> And you are not trying one.<br> We are both slaves!<br> Mr Mahmoud Ali, unless you sit down,<br> I shall have to exercise my authority.<br> Do so! This trial is a farce!<br> I'm going! I ruin my career!<br> Mrs Moore! Where are you, Mrs Moore?<br> We want Mrs Moore!<br> Mrs Moore! Mrs Moore!<br> Order! Order!<br> Farewell, my friend.<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> They have taken Mrs Moore!<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> - (crowd chanting)<br> Isn't it strange?<br> Rather wonderful.<br> - I knew they'd try something like this.<br> - (Das) Quiet, please.<br> - Poor old Das.<br> - Quiet! Order!<br> I apologise for my colleague.<br> He's an intimate friend of our client,<br> and his feelings have carried him away.<br> Mr Mahmoud Ali<br> will have to apologise in person.<br> Exactly, sir, he must.<br> I must repeat that, as a witness,<br> Mrs Moore does not exist.<br> Neither you, Mr Amritrao,<br> nor Mr McBryde, you,<br> have any right to surmise<br> what that lady would have said.<br> She is not here and,<br> consequently, she can say nothing.<br> Thou knowest, Lord,<br> the secrets of our hearts.<br> Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer.<br> We therefore commit her body to the deep<br> to be turned into corruption.<br> Looking for the resurrection of the body,<br> when the sea shall give up her dead.<br> I heard a voice from heaven<br> saying unto me:<br> "Blessed are the dead,<br> which die in the Lord."<br> (chanting) Mrs Moore!<br> Mrs Moore!<br> (McBryde) I now call upon Miss Quested.<br> Place your hand on the book.<br> And nothing but the truth.<br> (Das) Quiet, please. Silence!<br> Now, Miss Quested...<br> I'd like to take you back to the moment<br> when you came out of that first cave<br> and found Mrs Moore<br> collapsed in her chair.<br> - Are you with me?<br> - Yes.<br> Did she offer any explanation?<br> She said she was upset by the echo<br> and that she was tired.<br> Taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner<br> instructed the servants to remain behind,<br> and took you off alone with the guide.<br> Yes. But it was<br> at Mrs Moore's suggestion.<br> I don't quite follow.<br> She'd been worried by the crowd<br> and the stuffiness.<br> And was concerned that you might be<br> subjected to the same ordeal.<br> No. She wanted us<br> to enjoy ourselves. She said so.<br> She likes Dr Aziz.<br> Yes, I think I understand the situation.<br> Yesterday, Mr Fielding said that<br> Mrs Moore was "charmed" by him.<br> It was more than that. She liked him.<br> Nevertheless, you'd only met him on two<br> occasions before the day of the crime.<br> So it might possibly have been<br> a rather impetuous assessment.<br> Possibly. She's like that.<br> Miss Quested, you heard this morning the<br> slur cast on British justice by the defence.<br> It is most important that you tell the court<br> the absolute truth of what took place.<br> - I was brought up to tell the truth.<br> - Of course.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's quite all right.<br> Now, Miss Quested, you went off up<br> the slope with the prisoner and the guide.<br> Yes.<br> Take your time and cast your mind back.<br> Miss Quested?<br> Miss Quested,<br> we were going up the slope.<br> Is something wrong?<br> I think it may have partly been my fault.<br> - Why?<br> - We'd stopped to look out over the plain.<br> I could hardly see Chandrapore<br> except through Mr Heaslop's binoculars.<br> I asked Dr Aziz if he loved his wife<br> when he married her.<br> I shouldn't have done that.<br> Then why did you do it?<br> I was thinking of my own marriage.<br> Mr Heaslop and I<br> had only just become engaged.<br> Seeing Chandrapore so far away,<br> I realised I didn't love him.<br> (murmuring)<br> Quiet, please. Quiet.<br> Miss Quested, you and the prisoner<br> continued up to the caves?<br> - Yes.<br> - Where was the guide?<br> - He'd gone on ahead.<br> - Sent on ahead?<br> No, he was waiting for us<br> further along the ledge.<br> But when you reached the caves, prisoner<br> left you and went to speak to the guide?<br> - I don't know if he spoke to him or not.<br> - But he went off in his direction.<br> Yes.<br> - And what did you do?<br> - I waited.<br> (Das) You said just now<br> "I think it may have been partly my fault."<br> - Why?<br> - I had asked him about love.<br> And had thereby introduced<br> a feeling of intimacy?<br> That is what I meant.<br> Thank you.<br> Mr McBryde.<br> Please tell the court<br> exactly what happened.<br> I lit a match.<br> (Aziz) Miss Quested!<br> Miss Quested!<br> Miss Quested?<br> - And the prisoner followed you?<br> - (rumble)<br> Miss Quested, the prisoner<br> followed you, didn't he?<br> Could I please have a minute<br> before I reply to that, Mr McBryde?<br> Certainly.<br> I'm not...<br> I'm not quite sure.<br> (murmuring)<br> I beg your pardon?<br> You are in the cave,<br> and the prisoner followed you.<br> What do you mean, please?<br> - No.<br> - What is that? What are you saying?<br> - I'm afraid I've made a mistake.<br> - What nature of mistake?<br> Dr Aziz never followed me into the cave.<br> Now, let us go on. I will read you<br> the deposition which you signed.<br> (Das) Mr McBryde, you cannot go on.<br> I was speaking to the witness.<br> And the public will be silent!<br> Miss Quested,<br> address your remarks to me.<br> And remember - you speak on oath,<br> Miss Quested.<br> Dr Aziz...<br> I stop these proceedings<br> on medical grounds!<br> Quiet! Please, sit down!<br> You withdraw the accusation,<br> Miss Quested?<br> Answer me.<br> I withdraw everything.<br> Order! Order!<br> The prisoner is released<br> without one stain on his character!<br> Dr Aziz is free!<br> Are you mad?<br> No.<br> (rumble)<br> (banging and screaming)<br> (chanting) Dr Aziz! Dr Aziz!<br> Bitch.<br> We won!<br> What do you think you've been doing?<br> Miss Quested!<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I don't know.<br> You can't wander about like this.<br> - Who did you come with?<br> - I shall walk.<br> What madness.<br> This could turn into a riot.<br> We'll find my carriage. It's closed.<br> Richard!<br> Richard!<br> - I'm coming back.<br> - Stay with him, please.<br> I can't leave you here.<br> Anything could happen.<br> - There we are.<br> - Congratulations, sir!<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> Make way, please. Thank you.<br> - Where shall he take you?<br> - I don't know.<br> What do you mean?<br> Get in.<br> (cheering)<br> That was Mr Fielding!<br> - And Mrs Moore!<br> - Mrs Moore!<br> Why did you make such a charge<br> if you were going to withdraw it?<br> - I ought to feel grateful to you, I suppose.<br> - I don't expect gratitude.<br> Did you do it out of pity?<br> My echo's gone.<br> I call the noise in my head my echo.<br> I've had it since the cave.<br> Might the whole thing<br> have been an hallucination?<br> I have a hunch that<br> poor old McBryde exorcised you.<br> He took you back,<br> step by logical step, into that cave,<br> and you broke down quite suddenly.<br> - I thought you meant I'd seen a ghost.<br> - No, no.<br> - Mrs Moore believes in ghosts.<br> - Well, she's an old lady.<br> No, I only meant that<br> it's difficult, as we get older,<br> not to believe that the dead live again.<br> Because the dead don't live again.<br> I fear not.<br> So do I.<br> (Fielding) Ranjit!<br> He must have gone to the tamasha,<br> but I can make some tea.<br> Oh, forgive me a moment.<br> Oh, dear.<br> "Annie Blair, fellow passenger."<br> I shall never see her again.<br> - Ah, Godbole.<br> - The boys said you were back.<br> Yes.<br> I'm leaving for Kashmir tomorrow<br> morning to take up my duties<br> as minister of education.<br> I came to say goodbye.<br> Yes? Er... come in.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> Miss Quested.<br> Please, I want to give you my address<br> and extend an open invitation<br> for you to visit me.<br> Have you seen the Himalayas,<br> Mr Fielding?<br> No.<br> - Miss Quested has had some bad news.<br> - Oh, I am sorry.<br> - Mrs Moore.<br> - Yes.<br> - Addressed to you.<br> - Yes.<br> - Why did this lady send to you?<br> - I don't know.<br> Mr Fielding,<br> I would venture to remark...<br> Under the circumstances, I don't think<br> we should pursue the matter further.<br> I'm sorry, Godbole,<br> but Miss Quested is extremely upset.<br> Of course, of course. Nevertheless...<br> I presumably came up<br> in a casual shipboard conversation.<br> No doubt Heaslop<br> will be hearing from the company.<br> - I see.<br> - I shan't tell Aziz until tomorrow.<br> Hamidullah's bound to be putting on<br> a celebration, and it'll only upset him.<br> Oh, and have you heard<br> about the damages?<br> - Damages?<br> - Amritrao is asking 20,000 rupees from...<br> And costs.<br> Who could have foretold that Aziz<br> would be saved by his enemy?<br> What now, Mr Fielding?<br> - Aziz!<br> - Come in.<br> Well, what a wonderful day for you.<br> I am an Indian at last.<br> Where did you take her?<br> I took her back to the college.<br> Why?<br> After this morning,<br> she'd nowhere else to go.<br> - No?<br> - Heaslop? The Turtons?<br> She had the entire British Raj<br> behind her pushing her on.<br> But when she saw she was wrong, she<br> stopped and sent it all to smithereens.<br> I wouldn't have had the courage.<br> (shouts in Urdu)<br> Do you mind if I sit?<br> Please.<br> What will you do now?<br> Hamidullah's giving me a victory party<br> with fireworks and music.<br> Good. But I meant later.<br> Now this dreadful business is over.<br> I shall look for another job.<br> Hundreds of miles from here<br> in an Indian state out of British India.<br> - And you?<br> - I shall go to England for a long leave.<br> Will you and she be going back<br> on the same boat?<br> No. I couldn't possibly get away<br> before the end of next term.<br> Miss Quested is going<br> as soon as she can get a passage.<br> I see.<br> - Look...<br> - I'm looking.<br> Godbole tells me that Amritrao<br> is asking 20,000 rupees damages.<br> And costs.<br> I'd hate to see her getting<br> the worst of both worlds. It'll ruin her.<br> And me? Prison,<br> my private letters read out in court,<br> my wife's photograph taken to<br> the station to be fingered by McBryde,<br> all because a girl "fresh from England"<br> got too much sun.<br> I know.<br> And I know what you're going to ask next.<br> You're going to ask me to let her off<br> paying 20,000 rupees, right?<br> Then, if I agree,<br> the English will be able to say<br> "Here is an Indian that almost<br> behaved like a gentleman."<br> "But for the colour of his face,<br> we might even let him join the club."<br> Is that why you came here to see me?<br> Answer me.<br> In the end, you English<br> always stick together.<br> I want to have nothing more<br> to do with any of you.<br> Any of you!<br> You can go back to the college<br> and tell her to keep the money.<br> Tell her to use it to buy herself<br> a husband! Tell her...<br> (speaks Urdu)<br> (festive music)<br> (cheering)<br> Are you coming with me?<br> I don't think so.<br> (both speak Urdu)<br> This is a great honour, Professor.<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - No, no.<br> They arrive at the state guest house<br> this afternoon.<br> How long have you known<br> they were coming?<br> One month, possibly two.<br> - Why did you not tell me?<br> - One cannot tell anyone anything<br> unless they are ready to hear it.<br> And what does that mean?<br> Mr Fielding wrote you letters from<br> London and Bombay. You tore them up.<br> - I did.<br> - That is my point.<br> "My dear Aziz,<br> I have some news for you."<br> "I am going to marry<br> someone whom you know."<br> The end of a foolish experiment.<br> I have made a new life for myself<br> up here... away from the English.<br> I shall be going to<br> the guest house to greet them.<br> But my religious duties will be claiming<br> my full attention for the next three days.<br> He's come all this way to find you.<br> Can you not let bygones be bygones<br> and show them around?<br> I'm sorry, but I've had enough<br> of showing Miss Quested India.<br> Stop. Let's stop for a moment.<br> We must be getting on.<br> Houseboat, sahib.<br> Hello!<br> Aziz!<br> Well, here you are at last.<br> I've been looking for you everywhere.<br> Akbar! Jamila!<br> Your children?<br> Yes.<br> I suppose Godbole told you I was here.<br> The minister of education never tells<br> anyone anything unless he has to.<br> His only piece of information was that<br> the high school was destined not to be.<br> I was supposed to inspect it.<br> Anyhow, here I am.<br> I've been visiting schools<br> all over the country.<br> We called in at Chandrapore.<br> Your bungalow's been turned into a shop.<br> Turton's retired and<br> Callendar's been given the push.<br> And Hamidullah sends his salaams.<br> It was he who told me<br> you'd moved up here.<br> So I wrote, care of Godbole.<br> Why didn't you answer my letters?<br> You married my enemy,<br> stole my money.<br> Aziz, I'm going to surprise you.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - My wife is Mrs Moore's daughter.<br> - Stella?<br> - Stella.<br> Miss Quested introduced us.<br> What a blunder.<br> - Where is she?<br> - I left her at the guest house.<br> You'll meet her tomorrow.<br> She mustn't do too much just now.<br> She is carrying your child?<br> Yes.<br> So after all,<br> your name will not die out.<br> That's right.<br> Mrs Moore.<br> Mrs Moore!<br> "And Stella believes the evil<br> of the Marabar has been wiped out,<br> and so do I."<br> "Dear Miss Quested,<br> tonight is the Festival of Light,<br> and I am writing this<br> to ask you to forgive me."<br> "It has taken all this time for me<br> to appreciate your courage."<br> "Because of you, I am happy here<br> with my children instead of in prison."<br> "And because of you,<br> I want to do kind actions all round."<br> "Richard and Stella left this morning."<br> Goodbye.<br> "I do not think I will ever see them again."<br>
