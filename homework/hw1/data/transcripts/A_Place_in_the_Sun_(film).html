                        You want a ride?<br> - Is this the place?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yes?<br> - I'd like to see Mr Charles Eastman.<br> So would I. I expect to<br> if I work another five years!<br> - How do I get to his office?<br> - Go to the administration building.<br> Just a moment.<br> - Mr Eastman?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry. Our Mr Eastman is<br> at home today. He won't be in.<br> He won't?<br> - Are you a relative?<br> - He's my uncle.<br> I'm sure he'll want to see you.<br> Let me give him a ring.<br> Yes, one moment, please.<br> Paris can dictate to women what to<br> wear at a cocktail party or to bed.<br> Paris is not going to tell American<br> women what bathing suits to wear!<br> - Miss Ottinger.<br> - Hello.<br> Who?<br> Yes, of course. All right, let me<br> have a word with the young man.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's on number two.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, my boy.<br> - I hope you remember, sir.<br> - Of course. How are you?<br> You certainly got here fast.<br> I wanted to. But I didn't want<br> to bother you at home.<br> Drop by to the house<br> at about seven o'clock.<br> Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir.<br> My tie on crooked?<br> No, it's just that I was thinking...<br> George Eastman's dropping in tonight.<br> George Eastman...?<br> You mean Asa's son?<br> - Right. I ran into him in Chicago.<br> - Will he lead us in a prayer?<br> He's not at all like Asa or his wife.<br> He's very quiet and pleasant.<br> Not much education, but ambitious.<br> And he looks amazingly like Earl.<br> - What's he do?<br> - Hotel bellhop.<br> I always wanted<br> to look like a bellhop!<br> Why bring him on here?<br> There's always a place at the plant.<br> - What do we do about him socially?<br> - Easy. Leave town.<br> You don't have to take him up<br> socially. He just wants to work.<br> - A man by the name of Eastman.<br> - Show him in, William.<br> Charles, sometimes I think<br> you're in your second childhood.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Hi, George.<br> This is my wife.<br> My daughter, Marcia.<br> My son, Earl. George Eastman.<br> Sit down, George.<br> - Like a cocktail, a drink?<br> - No, thank you.<br> My husband says he met you<br> in Chicago at a hotel.<br> - That's right.<br> - You must have left very suddenly.<br> Well, you see, I quit my job.<br> Mr Eastman was good enough to say<br> that if I came through here,<br> he might find some place for me.<br> I think we can work something out.<br> - What do you think, Earl?<br> - Done any bookkeeping?<br> - Typewriting? Stenography?<br> - No.<br> You see Earl in the morning.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> That's very kind of you.<br> And your mother? I trust she's well.<br> We've never met,<br> but I've heard her mentioned.<br> She wrote Charles a moving letter<br> at the time of your father's death.<br> Is she still active<br> in her religious work?<br> - Yes, ma'am, she is.<br> - Church work?<br> Not exactly. It's more like<br> social work. It's a mission.<br> Like the Salvation Army?<br> No, it's not like the Salvation Army.<br> - It's more...<br> - More intimate, maybe?<br> Did I hear you say intimate, darling?<br> - You're late.<br> - I'm always late.<br> It's part of my charm. Good evening,<br> Mr Eastman, Mrs Eastman.<br> You know Tom Tipton.<br> Don't drink. We haven't got time.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Well, I'm ready.<br> Men are so disgustingly prompt!<br> They do it to put us women<br> in a bad light.<br> I hear your place is<br> coming along fine.<br> - It's a dream palace.<br> - Will it be ready for summer?<br> - Even if I have to whip everyone!<br> - All right, Simone Legree. Let's go.<br> - Goodnight, Eastman.<br> - Good night.<br> - Bye-bye!<br> - Bye.<br> Have you anywhere to stay?<br> I can recommend a quiet<br> rooming house.<br> - My secretary used to stay there.<br> - Thanks. I found a place.<br> That was fortunate, wasn't it?<br> Sorry we're not home for dinner.<br> Another time perhaps.<br> Yes. You see Earl in the morning.<br> Good night.<br> - Good night, sir. Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Charles Eastman!<br> Be aware every minute<br> that you're an Eastman.<br> - You must act accordingly.<br> - I understand that.<br> Another thing.<br> As you noticed, nine out of ten<br> Eastman employees are women.<br> There's a company rule against<br> mixing with the girls here.<br> My father asked me to call this<br> to your attention. That is a must.<br> This is George Eastman.<br> Take George to Mr Whiting, please.<br> Mrs Kovak, this is George Eastman.<br> - He's here for a while.<br> - OK.<br> This is it.<br> Now you're in business.<br> - Hello, Angela.<br> - Hi, Angela.<br> Look, this room could be your study.<br> There's even an old cupboard<br> for your books.<br> Whatever else is in it,<br> it isn't books!<br> - Who lived here?<br> - A pirate in search ofhis soul.<br> Think he found it?<br> - Vicky...<br> - What?<br> Could we be happy here,<br> never seeing anyone again?<br> - Small world.<br> - That's what you think.<br> Put your arms around me.<br> Imagine the sea at night.<br> Who's your friend?<br> Hold me, Ray.<br> When I feel you close,<br> all our lies come true.<br> Nothing can ever spoil them again.<br> If the girls saw me, they'd say<br> I was making up to the boss's nephew.<br> That's silly.<br> I'm in the same boat as you.<br> An Eastman isn't in the same boat<br> with anyone.<br> - I work along with you, don't I?<br> - Sure.<br> They'll move you to a better job,<br> and you'll be in the front office.<br> That's the last we'll see<br> of Mr George Eastman.<br> Who says that?<br> We know they put you<br> in with us to learn the business.<br> I wouldn't be too sure of that.<br> ...Lord's divine command,<br> when you find a brother struggling,<br> Iend a willing, helping hand.<br> Bear ye one another's burdens...<br> - You lonely all the time?<br> - Not on week days.<br> How come?<br> Remember I put swimsuits<br> in boxes six days a week?<br> Yeah. What about Sundays? Maybe<br> then you put yourself in a swimsuit.<br> Not me.<br> Why? You don't look good<br> in a swimsuit?<br> - Sure I do. I can't swim.<br> - You're kidding!<br> I never learned.<br> I was even scared of the duck pond<br> when I was a kid.<br> We lived on a farm, a small one.<br> How come you came here?<br> We were poor. We needed the money.<br> I came down here and got a job.<br> - I'm glad.<br> - Me, too.<br> This is it, where I live.<br> - It's 4433 Elm Avenue.<br> - I'll walk you to the door.<br> I can manage from here.<br> I have my own private entrance.<br> Good night.<br> My landlady is fierce.<br> I've wanted to do that for so long.<br> I did, too.<br> Will we see each other again<br> like this?<br> - If you want.<br> - When?<br> It's up to you. You gotta be careful.<br> We can meet like tonight.<br> Tonight has been wonderful!<br> I'd better go in now.<br> Don't go.<br> Please don't go.<br> Good night.<br> - I was looking over at you today.<br> - I was looking over at you.<br> Not as much as usual.<br> - I was thinking about my plan.<br> - Don't we work fast enough as it is?<br> - Hi, beautiful.<br> - Hello, Angela.<br> George, I'm glad you're still<br> in the packaging room.<br> Not just for my sake, honest.<br> It's better for you than running<br> around with those Eastmans<br> and all those rich girls<br> with nothing to do.<br> I've only been out to the house<br> once since I got here.<br> I used to think you went every night.<br> Don't be silly, honey.<br> George, remember when I said<br> if you're an Eastman, you're not<br> in the same boat with anybody?<br> Yeah.<br> I take it back.<br> Let's find a quieter place.<br> You don't know any other place<br> we can go, do you?<br> There's a soda fountain<br> where all the high school kids go.<br> They're noisy.<br> I don't care as long as I'm with you.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Talking.<br> They've invented the house.<br> It's a very good place to talk in.<br> You'd better get back to yours.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> - Good night.<br> - Come on.<br> I wish I could ask you in,<br> but Mrs Roberts is so strict.<br> I don't want to make things<br> difficult for you.<br> I wish I could ask you in, but we'd<br> have to keep the music awful low.<br> This is nice.<br> Mrs Roberts is right next door.<br> This is the way it should have been.<br> This is the way...<br> Oh, George.<br> George.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> Who's that? Is that George?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What's he doing here?<br> It was the only place to put him<br> without firing somebody.<br> This is no place for him.<br> - How's he getting along?<br> - Fine.<br> It wouldn't hurt to give him<br> a position. Well, George.<br> You thought I'd forgotten<br> all about you.<br> - No, sir.<br> - I've been keeping an eye on you.<br> - That's very good of you, sir.<br> - Getting along all right?<br> - I know the work pretty well.<br> - I suppose you do.<br> Do you know it well enough<br> to take on responsibility?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good. I'm going to move you up.<br> - Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.<br> - You've earned it.<br> Sir, I was wondering...<br> Have you by any chance seen<br> the production report I submitted?<br> Mrs Eastman is having a party at<br> the house on the 15th of next month.<br> - We'd like to have you drop in.<br> - I'd love to come.<br> Good. Then you and I can have<br> a nice little talk.<br> Next month on the 15th?<br> That's your birthday.<br> I was planning on our little party.<br> Sure, honey.<br> I'll just be at the old man's<br> to pay my respects.<br> - Then I'll be over.<br> - You better be!<br> - Hello, darling!<br> - Nice to see you again.<br> Hello, there.<br> Later.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - I see you had a misspent youth.<br> - Yes, it was.<br> Why all alone? Being exclusive?<br> Being dramatic?<br> Being blue?<br> I'm just fooling around.<br> Maybe you'd like to play.<br> No, I'll just watch you. Go ahead.<br> Do I make you nervous?<br> Yes.<br> You look like an Eastman.<br> Are you one of them?<br> I'm a nephew. My name's George.<br> - I'm Angela.<br> - Vickers.<br> - I saw you here last spring.<br> - I don't remember seeing you.<br> No. You've been away, haven't you?<br> You took a trip with your parents.<br> - How did you know?<br> - I read about you in the papers.<br> - What else do you do?<br> - The usual things.<br> You look unusual.<br> That's the first time<br> anybody ever said that!<br> - You keep pretty much to yourself.<br> - Yes, sometimes.<br> Blue...or exclusive?<br> - Neither, right now.<br> - Here you are, George!<br> Well, Angela.<br> - I was thinking how's your mother?<br> - Fine, last time I heard.<br> Have you written to her about your<br> promotion? I kicked him up a notch.<br> I'll write in a day or two.<br> Never neglect your mother.<br> Telephone to her right away.<br> Tell her the good news.<br> You can use this phone.<br> Long distance? What's the number,<br> George? Just a minute.<br> I don't know.<br> Hello.<br> I want to place a call to the Bethel<br> Independent Mission in Kansas City.<br> - The Bethel Mission.<br> - Hello, Mama.<br> George! God bless you, my son.<br> Are you sick?<br> No, I'm not sick.<br> Are you coming home?<br> Listen, Mama. I got a promotion.<br> Yeah, I can send you money<br> every month now.<br> Happy birthday. Today's your<br> birthday and I've prayed for you.<br> I've been praying you'll come home<br> and carry on your father's work.<br> I'm keeping your room for you, just<br> as you left it, like I always do.<br> I'm getting on pretty well here.<br> I'm happy here, too.<br> - Who's there with you?<br> - It's me, Mama!<br> - Who was that?<br> - Just a girl, Mama.<br> No, Mama.<br> I don't... Mama, I just met her!<br> Yes, Mama. I will, Mama.<br> I know you'll be a good son.<br> I promise.<br> - Goodbye, my son.<br> - Goodbye, Mama.<br> Did you promise to be a good boy?<br> Not to waste your time on girls?<br> - I don't waste my time.<br> - Will she let you go out tonight?<br> Will she let you go dancing? Come on.<br> I'll take you dancing...<br> on your birthday, blue boy.<br> Gee, Al, isn't it the limit?<br> The party just broke up<br> a few minutes ago.<br> I'm sorry, honey.<br> I couldn't get away for three hours.<br> Four hours. You must have paid him<br> an awful lot of respects.<br> He's really gonna do things for me.<br> He said, "I got my eye on you."<br> I think he really means it, too.<br> That's fine.<br> But you could have phoned me.<br> - Yeah, I know, I could have phoned.<br> - Never mind.<br> Your present's waiting for you<br> on your plate.<br> - Happy birthday.<br> - Thanks.<br> Hey, that's wonderful! I can sure<br> use that on my new job, huh?<br> Were there many young people<br> there tonight?<br> - A few. Why?<br> - Oh, it's melted.<br> Was your cousin Marcia there?<br> All those pretty girls in the papers?<br> Some of them were, yes.<br> They're not all pretty.<br> - Was Angela Vickers?<br> - What?<br> Pretty. Did you like her very much?<br> I liked her some.<br> Sure, she's a pretty girl.<br> - She wears nice clothes.<br> - Why shouldn't she, with that money?<br> Why do you keep needling me?<br> I can't help it.<br> Why couldn't you tell them<br> you had an appointment?<br> You know I can't tell them about you.<br> You understand the fix we're in.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> If my family ever found out about us,<br> we'd both be out of a job.<br> George, maybe you don't want to see<br> me so much any more. Is that it?<br> Maybe you don't want<br> to see me at all.<br> - Now you're head of the department.<br> - You know I didn't say that.<br> Honey, don't cry.<br> Look, you dance just as pretty<br> as anybody. You look just as pretty.<br> Stop crying, will you?<br> George, it's awful.<br> I can't tell you.<br> - What is it?<br> - I'm so afraid.<br> Honey, what's the matter?<br> George...we're in trouble.<br> Real trouble, I think.<br> How do you mean?<br> Remember the first night<br> you came here?<br> I'm so worried.<br> Hello, Al. It's me. How do you feel?<br> Just the same, huh?<br> No, I haven't found the name<br> of any doctor yet.<br> Yes, don't you worry. Everything's<br> gonna turn out all right.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, first thing.<br> Good night.<br> Hello?<br> Speaking.<br> Who?<br> Oh, hello!<br> Yes, of course I remember you. I just<br> didn't recognise your voice at first.<br> Friday night? Yeah.<br> I think I can.<br> No, I'd like to. Yes.<br> Where?<br> All right. I'll meet you there.<br> Yeah. Goodbye, Miss Vickers.<br> Huh?<br> Goodbye, Angela.<br> - A penny.<br> - For what?<br> For your thoughts.<br> Highest prices paid.<br> I was wondering<br> why you invited me tonight.<br> Because of my reasons.<br> Good evening, Miss Vickers.<br> Good evening, Mr Eastman.<br> Good evening.<br> - Angela, darling, hello.<br> - Hello, Marcia.<br> - Hello, George. Having fun?<br> - I just got here.<br> Come on in and join the party.<br> It's going to be<br> such a wonderful summer.<br> - Do you ride?<br> - I'm just taking it up.<br> Hello, Mother, Dad.<br> We keep several horses.<br> There'll be lots of parties<br> and dances and things like that.<br> And who, may I ask, is he?<br> If she weren't my daughter,<br> I'd ask her the same question.<br> Aren't you happy with me?<br> Happy? The trouble is<br> I'm too happy tonight.<br> You seem so strange,<br> so deep and far away.<br> As though you were<br> holding something back.<br> - I am.<br> - Don't.<br> I'd better.<br> This is nice.<br> I don't want to spoil it.<br> You'd better tell me.<br> I love you. I've loved you<br> since the first moment I saw you.<br> I guess maybe I even loved you<br> before I saw you.<br> And you're the fellow that wondered<br> why I invited you here tonight.<br> I tell you why. I love...<br> Are they watching us?<br> I love you, too! It scares me.<br> - But it is a wonderful feeling.<br> - It's wonderful when you're here.<br> I can hold you, I can see you.<br> I can hold you next to me.<br> But what's it going to be like<br> next week?<br> I'll still be as much in love<br> with you. You'll be gone!<br> But I'll be at the lake!<br> You'll come and see me.<br> It's so beautiful. You must come.<br> I know my parents will be a problem.<br> But you can come the weekends<br> when the kids are there.<br> You don't have to work weekends.<br> That's the best time.<br> If you don't come,<br> I'll drive down here to see you.<br> I'll pick you up outside the factory.<br> You'll be my pick-up! We'll arrange<br> it somehow, whatever way we can.<br> We'll have such wonderful times<br> together, just the two of us.<br> - I'd be the happiest person alive.<br> - The second happiest.<br> Angela, if I could only tell you<br> how much I love you.<br> - If I could only tell you all.<br> - Tell Mama.<br> Tell Mama all.<br> - Your age, Mrs Hamilton?<br> - Twenty-two.<br> How long married?<br> Three months.<br> Well, now... Sit down.<br> What seems to be the trouble,<br> Mrs Hamilton?<br> You needn't be afraid to tell me.<br> That's my business,<br> listening to other people's troubles.<br> It's like this.<br> My husband hasn't much money.<br> I have to work<br> to help pay the expenses.<br> Yes?<br> When I found out I was going<br> to have a baby...<br> ...we didn't see...<br> We didn't know any doctors.<br> What business is your husband in?<br> Electrician.<br> That's not such a bad business.<br> At least they charge enough!<br> - We can't afford to...<br> - There are free hospitals, you know?<br> I know.<br> Free hospitals<br> don't solve everything.<br> Tell me, how did you happen<br> to come to me, anyhow?<br> I heard people say<br> you were a good doctor.<br> I see.<br> Mrs Hamilton, when you went<br> to the altar three months ago,<br> you must have realised you might<br> have to face a situation like this.<br> Once you make up your mind<br> to face this bravely,<br> you'll find all the problems<br> have a way of sorting themselves out.<br> Medical bills, clothes. I know.<br> I know my wife and I<br> worried at first.<br> - But now we can look back...<br> - It's not like that!<br> I'm not married.<br> I haven't got a husband.<br> All right, that won't do any good.<br> - Where's the young man?<br> - He deserted me. What'll I do?<br> Somebody's gotta help me.<br> Miss Hamilton, my advice is go home<br> and see your parents and tell them.<br> It'll be much better that way,<br> I assure you.<br> If you've come to place yourself<br> under my care during your pregnancy,<br> I'll do everything to ensure<br> your health and that of your child.<br> On the other hand,<br> if you've just come for free advice<br> on material and financial problems...<br> ...with which I can't help you...<br> No, I cannot help you.<br> What did he say?<br> He said he thought I ought<br> to make a very healthy mother.<br> Gee, Al.<br> That's all you've said for weeks.<br> I'm trying to think.<br> You just gotta marry me.<br> Family or no family.<br> This future of yours or no future.<br> Just looking at it that way<br> settles everything.<br> But we haven't got any money.<br> This thing comes out, I'm through.<br> I won't even have the job I got now.<br> - You're just stalling.<br> - I'm not! I'm trying to think.<br> I want to figure out some way.<br> I was thinking maybe when I get<br> my vacation, first week of September.<br> All right, that's when we'll do it.<br> When you get your vacation,<br> we'll go out of town and get married.<br> - You understand?<br> - Yeah, I understand.<br> Now back again to the news.<br> It seems the fine weather has been<br> too fine in parts of the country.<br> In New York City, seven persons<br> are reported as having succumbed<br> from the high temperature.<br> Nearer home, fine weather<br> had its darker aspects, too.<br> The State Highway Patrol says that<br> fatalities from weekend accidents<br> exceeded by four the figure for the<br> corresponding weekend last summer.<br> Some 14 persons lost their lives.<br> At least five were drowned.<br> Several others received emergency<br> first aid at crowded lake resorts.<br> So be careful.<br> It may be your turn next or<br> the turn of those dearest to you.<br> Drive carefully, and don't swim<br> from unpatrolled beaches.<br> Make your holiday<br> death's holiday, too.<br> George!<br> Hello, you.<br> - I've missed you so!<br> - Me, too. I can't tell you how much.<br> I've wonderful news.<br> I had to drive down to tell you.<br> Mother and Dad want you to spend<br> your vacation with us up at the lake.<br> - You'll come, won't you?<br> - I don't think I can.<br> George, no! This is my one chance<br> to show you off to Mother and Dad.<br> Take my word for it, I've got to!<br> I promised my uncle<br> I'd spend some time with him.<br> That's perfect! Your aunt and uncle<br> are both coming up on 3rd September.<br> That's when you're coming.<br> Darling, I love you so much,<br> so very much.<br> Just think of it.<br> We'll go swimming together,<br> lie in the sun together,<br> go horseback riding<br> through the pine woods.<br> I'll make breakfast for you every<br> morning, and you can sleep late.<br> I'll bring it in to you in your room.<br> - And you love me.<br> - Yes.<br> - Hello?<br> - I've gotta ask you a favour.<br> Don't get angry at me.<br> I've gotta ask you for an extra week.<br> - I don't have to give you anything.<br> - You just got to!<br> I talked to my uncle and<br> he wants me to come up to the lake<br> and spend the first week<br> of my vacation with them.<br> - It's important to both of us.<br> - Why?<br> I figure from the way he's been<br> talking that if I go up there<br> he's gonna give me a bonus.<br> It might be a lot of money,<br> I don't know, $300.<br> We could sure use that.<br> All right, you go up there<br> for a week. I'll wait here.<br> I want to talk to you about that.<br> I'm not sure I approve<br> of young Mr Eastman.<br> - I don't know what he's doing here.<br> - He's here because I invited him.<br> Why do you encourage this?<br> You can be very unperceptive<br> at times.<br> Opposition only makes a boy<br> of that type more attractive.<br> I invited him,<br> because I wanted to see him<br> among people Angela really knows.<br> She'll see whether he belongs or not.<br> Come on! It's freezing!<br> It's just like ice!<br> Hurry up!<br> I've never been so cold in my life!<br> - Aren't you going in?<br> - Sure.<br> George, put me down!<br> - It happens every single time!<br> - What does?<br> I freeze to death.<br> It's the coldest lake ever!<br> - What did you go in for, then?<br> - 'Cause it's my lake.<br> - Yours?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> I found this trail when I was 14.<br> Nobody lives here,<br> not on this part of it.<br> It's in two parts<br> with a little channel in between.<br> There's a crumbly old lodge down at<br> the end and some crumbly old boats.<br> Come closer.<br> - What do they call this lake?<br> - Loon Lake. It's nice now.<br> But sometimes it's weird,<br> especially at sundown.<br> I've never been able to feel<br> the same about it since the drowning.<br> - What drowning?<br> - A man and a girl last summer.<br> Nobody knows what happened. It was<br> five days before they found the girl.<br> - And the man?<br> - They never found him.<br> - What was that?<br> - A loon.<br> - What are you thinking about?<br> - Nothing, nothing at all.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> And I used to think<br> I was complicated!<br> - Are you worried about my family?<br> - I suppose I am.<br> Don't. I've known them intimately<br> for years, and they're quite nice.<br> Perhaps they are a little unused<br> to you, but that'll come in time.<br> Suppose it doesn't?<br> - I'd go anywhere with you.<br> - You mean that? You'd marry me?<br> Haven't I told you? I intend to.<br> ...I've had a millstone named<br> Eastman round my neck.<br> I know just how you feel.<br> - What's golf got that a hike hasn't?<br> - A spirit of competition.<br> I've hardly exchanged five words<br> with your elusive nephew.<br> Pity, I'm told he's charming. I've<br> put him here so he won't run away.<br> I'm proud of the way<br> you've been getting on.<br> I've wanted to justify<br> your confidence in me.<br> A man who can meet people:<br> that's an asset we can use.<br> I've been thinking about a place<br> in administration perhaps,<br> where I can keep an eye on you.<br> We ought to take George<br> with us tomorrow.<br> - People at the club...<br> - No.<br> There's the Ski Race tomorrow<br> and George is my pilot.<br> - Which Mr Eastman?<br> - Mr George Eastman.<br> Call for you, George. You'd better<br> bend an ear, Angela, it's a woman.<br> Hello?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm here at the bus station.<br> You lied to me for the last time.<br> Now I want you to come and get me.<br> - It's not too easy right now.<br> - Now!<br> - It's not too easy right now.<br> - Now!<br> - I'll do it tomorrow morning?<br> - I said now!<br> If you're not here in half an hour,<br> I'll come and tell them everything!<br> Yes, I'll leave right away.<br> Let's not go to Florida this winter.<br> Let's stay here.<br> It was a friend of my mother's.<br> She's not well.<br> - I hope it's not serious.<br> - I don't know.<br> I ought to get home.<br> I ought to get a plane tonight.<br> - If it's not serious, do come back.<br> - I will, thank you.<br> - If you'll excuse me, I'll go pack.<br> - Certainly. Goodbye, George.<br> Goodbye, George.<br> George, how long will you be gone?<br> I don't know, darling.<br> I just don't know.<br> You will come back<br> as soon as you can?<br> - As soon as I can.<br> - You promise?<br> I promise.<br> Are you crazy, coming up here?<br> Phoning me like that<br> with my whole family listening in?<br> You weren't staying with your family.<br> You were staying with Angela Vickers.<br> I'm through waiting for you.<br> You're gonna marry me tomorrow,<br> or I'll tell the newspapers<br> everything, then I'll kill myself!<br> - Don't talk like that.<br> - You make me talk like that.<br> We'll go to Warsaw in the morning<br> and get married.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> I won't get out of here until<br> you say that you're gonna do it!<br> All right. Come on.<br> It's a holiday.<br> Look, Al.<br> Look, it's not my fault!<br> Besides, one day more is<br> not gonna make any difference.<br> There's a wonderful lake<br> near here, Loon Lake,<br> just the place you've always<br> wanted to go for a honeymoon.<br> We could go there.<br> There's a lodge on it, too.<br> If you like, we could spend<br> the day there,<br> and tomorrow<br> we can come back here.<br> - Al, are you listening?<br> - Yeah, I'm listening.<br> Tell you what, let's make a holiday<br> of it. Everybody else is.<br> Why don't we get some sandwiches<br> and have a picnic on the lake?<br> - How's that?<br> - That sounds pretty good.<br> Look, Al, let's not quarrel any more.<br> Let's try and make the best of it.<br> All right, let's make the best of it.<br> I should have stopped at that<br> last station. Yep, bone dry!<br> - Stupid!<br> - Is the lodge far from here?<br> No, it's only just around the bend.<br> Tell you what, why don't we take<br> our lunch and go down to the landing?<br> We can rent a boat<br> and have our picnic now.<br> I can pick up the gas later<br> and come back for the car.<br> - How does it sound?<br> - It sounds wonderful!<br> - It is beautiful!<br> - Yeah.<br> - How much to rent a boat?<br> - 25 cents an hour. $2 all day.<br> Are there many people<br> out on the lake today?<br> You've got it all to yourself.<br> - Are you people at the lodge?<br> - Yeah. That is, we will be tonight.<br> - Spend a couple of days there.<br> - You'll have to sign for it.<br> Sure.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> - That's funny.<br> - What?<br> I know another guy named Gilbert<br> Edwards. Lives over at Westbrook.<br> Pretty common name.<br> Only two times I ever heard.<br> - It doesn't leak, does it?<br> - I don't rent leaky boats!<br> Don't worry, my husband's<br> a very good swimmer.<br> It's so lonely here.<br> It's like we were the only<br> two people left in the world.<br> Maybe we are.<br> Maybe when we get back to shore,<br> everybody will have disappeared.<br> I'd like that, wouldn't you?<br> Then we could go anywhere.<br> We could live<br> in the biggest house in the world.<br> I'd like to live in a little house,<br> just big enough for the two of us.<br> Only there's gonna be<br> more than two of us.<br> What's the matter? You look sick.<br> Nothing! I'm out of breath.<br> I'm not used to rowing.<br> Rest for a while, dear.<br> We can just drift.<br> After all, we're not going anywhere.<br> Look behind you.<br> "Star light, star bright,"<br> "wish me luck, wish me light,<br> make my wish come true tonight."<br> Did you make a wish?<br> What did you wish?<br> Nothing.<br> Afraid it won't come true<br> if you tell?<br> I'm sorry that I've been<br> so nasty to you.<br> I didn't mean it.<br> It's just things happen,<br> and you just don't stay the same.<br> I will make it up to you.<br> I'll stick by you.<br> I do love you, George.<br> - We ought to get back. It's dark.<br> - That old man'll think we drowned!<br> Let's drift for a while. I'm not<br> afraid of the dark. It's so nice.<br> I'll tell you what I wished.<br> I wished that you loved me again.<br> You'll see, we'll make a go of it<br> if we give ourselves the chance.<br> We'll go where nobody knows us.<br> We'll get jobs, maybe together.<br> We'll do things together and go out<br> together, like any married couple.<br> After a while, you'll settle down<br> and be content with what you've got,<br> instead of working yourself up<br> over things.<br> It's the little things in life<br> that count.<br> We'll have to scrimp and save,<br> but we'll have each other.<br> - I'm not afraid of being poor.<br> - Stop it, Al!<br> - Why? What's the matter?<br> - Just stop it!<br> George?<br> What did you think of<br> when you saw the star?<br> You wished that you weren't here<br> with me, didn't you?<br> You wished I was where<br> you'd never have to see me again.<br> Maybe you wished that I was dead.<br> Do you wish that I was dead?<br> No, I didn't! Just leave me alone.<br> Poor George. I know it isn't easy<br> for you. I shouldn't have said that.<br> Stay where you are.<br> Who's there?<br> I'm trying to find the road.<br> I got lost.<br> You know where the road is?<br> It's down the trail<br> about a quarter of a mile.<br> Quiet, boy, quiet. Now stay there.<br> - Good morning, Mr Marlowe.<br> - Good morning, Mack.<br> It's for you. The coroner.<br> Yes, Doctor?<br> Oh? Just wait a minute, will you?<br> Bob, get these facts.<br> All right now.<br> Yes. Young couple drowned.<br> Give me all the facts.<br> - Is Miss Vickers around?<br> - No, she's playing tennis.<br> Everybody's gone somewhere.<br> Thank you.<br> Mr Eastman?<br> - Do you feel well?<br> - Yeah, fine.<br> Hello, George. It's been centuries!<br> - She said you were playing tennis.<br> - I was watching them.<br> I haven't eaten anything since you've<br> been away. Well, hardly anything.<br> Don't go away again, George.<br> Here, come and sit with me.<br> How is your mother?<br> She's much better. It wasn't<br> as serious as they thought.<br> I'm glad of that.<br> You look very tired.<br> I didn't get much sleep. I was even<br> a little airsick on the plane.<br> Poor George.<br> Anyway, I've got good news.<br> Mother and Dad are beginning to melt.<br> You're winning them over<br> with your boyish charm.<br> They'll let us announce it when I<br> come home from school at Christmas.<br> - At Christmas? Let's run away.<br> - Run away?<br> - Right now.<br> - But we don't have to.<br> Not the way things are going.<br> Mother will want a big wedding.<br> I've always dreamed of having one as<br> long as I can remember. All girls do.<br> Now don't start getting moody again!<br> Come on, you change<br> and I'll meet you on the terrace.<br> - Any identification on the girl?<br> - Yeah, this employment card.<br> From the Eastman Industries.<br> Alice Tripp or something.<br> The man gave his name<br> as Gilbert Edwards?<br> Yeah.<br> You can drag that lake,<br> you won't find him.<br> - How do you figure that, Bear Bait?<br> - I figure he left here in an auto.<br> When I went up to my cabin<br> around suppertime,<br> there was a Coup<br> parked in the woods up there.<br> About nine o'clock,<br> somebody started up that auto<br> and drove off awfully fast.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> George, where you been? Got another<br> woman stashed around someplace?<br> - You've been gone so long.<br> - Can't we be alone somewhere?<br> - We could take the speedboat.<br> - Yeah.<br> So they wanna be alone. We can't<br> have that. Come on, Lazy Bones!<br> Go!<br> How about some company?<br> Come on, everybody!<br> - There's no room for you!<br> - We'll fix that.<br> District Attorney Frank Marlowe's<br> officers investigate further.<br> An hour ago,<br> the coroner informed the press<br> that although the girl's death<br> was caused by drowning,<br> bruises would indicate<br> that a struggle took place.<br> The District Attorney has evidence<br> that the girl's male companion<br> may still be alive.<br> Three Boy Scouts have reported<br> that a young man, visibly upset...<br> You look tired, George.<br> - That's what I told him.<br> - Take a rest.<br> I think maybe that's a good idea.<br> Excuse me, won't you?<br> - Any news on the drowning?<br> - The papers see it as a murder.<br> - He's alive and he's drowned her.<br> - You read too many mysteries.<br> She was probably a chatterbox,<br> and he picked her up<br> and threw her overboard!<br> - I've been looking for you, sir.<br> - What is it?<br> Mr Vickers would like to see you<br> alone. He's in the living room, sir.<br> Sit down, will you?<br> I thought that you and I might<br> have a chat before dinner.<br> - Care for a drink?<br> - Please.<br> I'm gonna make it a double. I'm gonna<br> be a little bit personal, George.<br> It's about you and Angela and<br> this talk about your getting married.<br> I don't know whether<br> I'm for you or against you.<br> - I don't know you well enough.<br> - I know how you feel, Mr Vickers.<br> Who am I to think of marrying Angela?<br> Angela has everything.<br> Talk of marriage aside, we know<br> almost nothing about your background.<br> There's not much to know. What there<br> is, I've wanted to tell you myself.<br> My family is...<br> We were very poor people.<br> My family devoted their lives<br> to a kind of religious work.<br> Conducting sidewalk services,<br> street singing.<br> I was part of all that,<br> until the law came along and said<br> I ought to go to school.<br> I only went to school<br> till I was 13 years old.<br> We didn't ever have any money<br> for anything, so I left home.<br> I was gonna do something about it.<br> I took any job.<br> Busboy, elevator operator, caddie.<br> I had no training, no education.<br> Then I came here,<br> went to work for my uncle.<br> That's my background, Mr Vickers.<br> There's nothing very much<br> to recommend any approval.<br> But I love Angela more than<br> anything in the world.<br> I'd do anything to make her happy.<br> Even if it's right that<br> I shouldn't see her any more.<br> Easy, boy.<br> Forthrightness is a prime virtue.<br> I admire your frankness.<br> I should apologise for eavesdropping,<br> but I'm glad I listened.<br> Does that answer all your questions?<br> All I ask is that you two<br> don't do anything hasty.<br> - Let's get out.<br> - A drive.<br> - I just wanna be alone with you.<br> - Let's go.<br> I can't believe that this horrible<br> thing could happen to Alice.<br> - She was such a sweet, quiet girl.<br> - Ever meet any of her boyfriends?<br> There was a young man, but he hasn't<br> been around in a few weeks.<br> And who was he?<br> It's a small town. Any scandal would<br> hurt my business something awful.<br> There will be a scandal<br> if you don't cooperate.<br> I never met him, mind you,<br> but the girls said he was an Eastman.<br> But it couldn't be...<br> Not one of the Eastmans!<br> Get me the District Attorney's office<br> in Warsaw.<br> Here we go!<br> Look, he's gaining.<br> Safe! Safe and sound!<br> Calling car 41.<br> Man believed in your vicinity...<br> - The third time this summer.<br> - I can't understand it!<br> Height 5'10", hair dark,<br> complexion fair, build light.<br> - What's your name?<br> - George Eastman.<br> I'd hate to some day be picking up<br> the pieces of a pretty girl like you.<br> - Take it easy, will you?<br> - Anything you say.<br> I just love that officer.<br> He's so bloodcurdling.<br> And he writes such a nice hand.<br> Darling, what is it?<br> I'm tired, very tired.<br> Yes, you must be.<br> Darling, let's never leave this<br> place. Let's just stay here alone.<br> Don't let father upset you.<br> I'm the one who counts.<br> You're the only one.<br> The only one.<br> People are gonna say things, I know.<br> Things about me. About me, I know.<br> - It's gonna make you stop loving me.<br> - Don't talk like that!<br> - I was asleep.<br> - You were dreaming.<br> You were talking.<br> You said, "Not my fault."<br> Then you said something<br> I couldn't make out.<br> Then you said,<br> "Angela, don't hate me."<br> That was a bad dream, a false dream,<br> because I'll always love you.<br> We'd better go now. Mother's liable<br> to send out a posse for us.<br> You go in. I'll be along in a minute.<br> Every time you leave me for a minute,<br> it's like goodbye.<br> I like to believe it means<br> you can't live without me.<br> Is your name George Eastman?<br> Yes.<br> - You're under arrest.<br> - Why? What for?<br> Start walking back down the road and<br> you'll find out. Go on, get going.<br> And no monkey business, either.<br> That's him all right.<br> Mr Marlowe, here's your baby.<br> You're George Eastman? I suppose<br> you know what you're charged with?<br> No.<br> You don't know anything<br> about the murder of Alice Tripp?<br> - I'm not guilty.<br> - We've evidence.<br> - You're not going to deny it?<br> - Yes, I deny it.<br> Let's take you to the Vickers' and<br> see what your friends say about you.<br> Please don't take me back there!<br> I'll tell you all I can.<br> Don't take me back there.<br> I didn't intend to. I just wanted<br> to see what you'd have to say.<br> Take him to Warsaw, boys,<br> and lock him up.<br> We'll go to the Vickers' and<br> see what they have to say.<br> Say he's a relative,<br> came to the house once. Got that?<br> And have Hollister take his name off.<br> You had no inkling of his relations<br> with that girl?<br> No.<br> None of you knew<br> of this boy's double life?<br> No.<br> Mr Marlowe, if you've no further<br> questions for my daughter and me...<br> - ...will you excuse us?<br> - Of course.<br> Mr Vickers, I have no desire<br> to harass an innocent person.<br> I'd like to keep your daughter free<br> of scandal, but if the papers...<br> I'll keep her out of the papers.<br> You keep her out of the trial.<br> That may not be possible.<br> The defence would have to agree.<br> The defence will agree to it.<br> I'll see to that.<br> I'll engage the boy's lawyers.<br> If it appears he's innocent,<br> I'll spend $100,000 to defend him.<br> And if he's guilty?<br> I won't spend a cent to save him<br> from the electric chair.<br> Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Lulu.<br> The boy's tired.<br> I think that's enough for today.<br> I guess you're right.<br> Mr Bellows, has there been<br> any word from...?<br> From Miss Vickers?<br> No, George.<br> When Mr Eastman engaged us<br> to defend you,<br> we made an agreement not to drag<br> Miss Vickers into the case.<br> - Of course.<br> - It's in your interest, too.<br> Her appearance on the stand<br> would be irrelevant.<br> I feel it might be damaging<br> for you, too. We'll be back.<br> "After I got her on the lake,<br> I couldn't go through with it."<br> "Then the boat turned over."<br> You know, Art, he sold me.<br> I believe his story.<br> No more newspapers, Lulu.<br> Remember, I told you.<br> The people of this state charge<br> that murder in the first degree<br> has been committed by the prisoner<br> at the bar, George Eastman.<br> They charge that George Eastman<br> wilfully, and with malice<br> and cruelty and deception,<br> murdered,<br> then sought to conceal from justice<br> the body of Alice Tripp.<br> It will be for you,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> to decide what shall be done<br> with this man,<br> who has flouted every moral law,<br> broken every commandment...<br> ...who has crowned his infamy<br> with murder.<br> - What were Alice's feelings for him?<br> - Everybody knew she was in love.<br> What was this rule exactly?<br> It was to keep the foreman and staff<br> from fooling around with the girls.<br> One night last August,<br> I called Alice to the telephone.<br> It was him calling.<br> Doctor, you never saw<br> this young man?<br> No, but after she left my office,<br> she sat talking<br> with a man in a Coup.<br> - Objection!<br> - Sustained.<br> Along about nine o'clock,<br> he stumbled into my camp.<br> He was wet and looked scared.<br> This man was at the bus station<br> with this girl.<br> They were quarrelling.<br> She said she wouldn't leave<br> unless he promised.<br> Had violence been done to Miss<br> Tripp prior to her death by drowning?<br> She'd been struck by an instrument<br> with sufficient force to stun her.<br> I told him there wasn't<br> nobody else on the lake.<br> Then he signed Gilbert Edwards.<br> Having signed a false name,<br> he then proceeded to make sure<br> what took place would be<br> observed by no one?<br> No one except the person<br> who'd be unable to testify,<br> the girl he drowned?<br> - The prosecution must not...<br> - I withdraw the question.<br> The people rest.<br> This boy is on trial<br> for the act of murder,<br> not for the thought of murder.<br> Between the idea and deed<br> there's a difference.<br> If you find this boy guilty in desire<br> but not guilty in deed...<br> ...then he must walk out of this<br> courtroom as free as you or I.<br> However, since the prosecutor lacked<br> evidence, he's given you prejudice.<br> Lacking facts,<br> he's given you fantasy.<br> Of all the witnesses before you,<br> not one actually saw what happened.<br> I will now call to the stand<br> an eyewitness, the only eyewitness.<br> The only one who knows the truth,<br> the whole truth.<br> George Eastman,<br> please take the stand.<br> When we got to the lake, I suggested<br> we go rowing before it got dark.<br> Tell me, why did you give<br> a false name to the boat keeper?<br> We were going to stay at the lodge,<br> and we weren't married,<br> so I thought it better<br> not to give our real names.<br> Why did you engage the boat<br> to row the girl out onto the lake?<br> In the back of my mind<br> was the thought of drowning her.<br> But I didn't want to think<br> such things!<br> I couldn't help myself, I couldn't!<br> What happened after you rowed out?<br> I knew that I couldn't<br> go through with it.<br> - Then you had a change of heart.<br> - I object. He's leading the witness.<br> Objection sustained. Counsel will<br> refrain from leading the witness.<br> Yes, your honour.<br> What happened then?<br> That was when we decided<br> we ought to get back to the lodge.<br> She started talking<br> about getting married<br> and what our life together<br> would be like.<br> What was your reaction<br> to her talking that way?<br> She just looked at me.<br> She knew it was hopeless.<br> She accused me of wishing her dead.<br> Did you wish she were dead?<br> No, I didn't!<br> I wasn't thinking of that any more!<br> What were you thinking of<br> at that moment?<br> I was thinking of somebody else.<br> Another girl.<br> You were thinking that this other<br> girl and her world were lost forever.<br> What did you say<br> to Alice's accusation?<br> I told her it wasn't true,<br> I didn't want her to die.<br> Wasn't she alarmed or frightened?<br> - She even said, "Poor George!"<br> - Go on.<br> Then she started toward me<br> from the back of the boat.<br> I told her to stay where she was,<br> but she didn't.<br> She kept coming toward me,<br> then she started to fall.<br> I started to get up.<br> Then everything turned over.<br> In a second, we were in the water.<br> I was stunned.<br> Something must have<br> hit me as I fell in.<br> It all happened so fast,<br> I didn't know what I was doing.<br> George, was Alice conscious<br> when she fell into the water?<br> Yes, I heard her scream<br> but couldn't see her,<br> 'cause she was on the other side.<br> So I swam around to the other side.<br> She was... When I got there,<br> she'd gone down.<br> I never saw her again.<br> Do you solemnly swear<br> that you did not strike her?<br> I swear it!<br> - That you did not push her in?<br> - I did not!<br> That it was an accident<br> undesired by you?<br> I do. I do. I do.<br> That's all, your honour.<br> That night when you left the party<br> at the house at Bride's Lake<br> to meet Alice Tripp<br> in the bus station...<br> ...do you remember leaving<br> anything behind you?<br> No, I don't. I don't remember<br> leaving anything.<br> I'm referring to your heart!<br> Did you leave that behind you?<br> Did you, Eastman? Out there<br> on that terrace in the moonlight?<br> You left behind the girl you loved,<br> and with her your hopes,<br> your ambitions, your dreams.<br> Didn't you, Eastman?<br> You left behind everything you<br> wanted, including the girl you loved.<br> But you planned to return to it,<br> didn't you?<br> Answer me!<br> Yes.<br> When you told them all that night<br> you were going to visit your mother,<br> you were lying, weren't you?<br> When you gave the boat keeper<br> a false name, you were lying again?<br> Yes.<br> When you drove up to Loon Lake,<br> what reason did you give Alice Tripp<br> for parking so far away<br> from the lodge?<br> - We were out of gas.<br> - Weren't you lying again?<br> - Yes.<br> - Lies!<br> Every move you made<br> was built on lies.<br> Yet now you're facing death, you<br> can't tell anything but the truth!<br> All the same, it's true!<br> I didn't kill her.<br> So you persist in lying<br> about that, too. We'll see.<br> Step down into the boat<br> and show the jury what happened<br> when the boat overturned.<br> Take the same position you had<br> at the time of the drowning.<br> When the girl rose in the boat<br> to come towards you,<br> did she stumble about there?<br> - Speak up.<br> - Yes.<br> And then?<br> She fell sideways into the water.<br> - Then what?<br> - The boat turned over on top of us.<br> - What happened then?<br> - I couldn't see very clearly.<br> There was a thud,<br> as if the edge of the boat hit her.<br> Very likely!<br> After this accidental blow, how far<br> apart were you when you came up?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> You couldn't have been<br> more than a yard apart!<br> It was further.<br> From there to the jury box<br> or halfway or what?<br> From here to the jury box.<br> Not really. When you and she<br> came up, you're nearly 20 feet apart!<br> - Why couldn't you swim toward her?<br> - I don't know.<br> Step over here.<br> Was the boat as far as from here<br> to the bailiff?<br> Yes.<br> You're telling me<br> you couldn't swim to this weak girl<br> and buoy her up<br> till you could reach this boat?<br> You're lying! She was drowning,<br> and you just let her drown!<br> She was defenceless, you picked up<br> this oar and crashed it on her head!<br> You pushed that poor girl into<br> the lake. You watched her drown.<br> - Isn't that the truth?<br> - No.<br> That's all, your honour.<br> By the premature adoption<br> of an extreme belief and creed,<br> it is well to understand this in<br> looking to the duties of adult life,<br> in particular, the married state,<br> when you will emerge into a world of<br> grown-up problems for the first time.<br> Then he or she will view<br> the enthusiasms of youth...<br> ...problems which are the frequent<br> products of a sheltered immaturity.<br> It is when the hastily adopted<br> beliefs of youth are insufficient...<br> - Has the jury reached a verdict?<br> - We have, your honour.<br> The defendant will rise.<br> The clerk will read the verdict.<br> We find the defendant,<br> George Eastman,<br> guilty of murder in the first degree.<br> Order in the court!<br> - Hello, Mrs Eastman.<br> - Mama.<br> - My boy.<br> - Did you see the governor?<br> It's no use.<br> The governor couldn't be moved.<br> Your mother's done everything<br> a mother could do. That I know.<br> Death is a little thing.<br> You mustn't be afraid of it.<br> You must fear now<br> only for your immortal soul.<br> If that sin is on your soul, my son,<br> you must make your peace with God.<br> I don't believe<br> I'm guilty of all this.<br> They don't know. I wish I knew!<br> If you are guilty, then I am guilty.<br> I must share your guilt.<br> Mama, don't blame yourself.<br> They say only God and ourselves<br> know what our sins and sorrows are.<br> Perhaps in this case, only God knows.<br> George, perhaps you've hidden<br> the full truth even from yourself.<br> I don't wanna hide anything.<br> I wanna know.<br> There's one thing you've never told<br> anyone, even yourself.<br> There's one point in your story that<br> holds the answer you're looking for.<br> Yes...<br> When you were on the lake with that<br> poor girl, and the boat capsized...<br> ...and there was a moment<br> when you might have saved her.<br> I wanted to save her.<br> But I just couldn't.<br> Whom were you thinking of?<br> Whom were you thinking of<br> just at that moment?<br> Were you thinking of Alice?<br> Were you thinking of the other girl?<br> Then...in your heart was murder,<br> George.<br> God bless you, my boy.<br> God forgive me if I've failed you.<br> I came to see you.<br> I've thought lots about you, George.<br> All the time.<br> I went away to school...to learn.<br> I don't think I learned very much.<br> I love you, George.<br> I wanted you to know that.<br> I guess there's nothing more to say.<br> I know something now<br> that I didn't know before.<br> I am guilty of a lot of things,<br> most of what they say of me.<br> All the same,<br> I'll go on loving you...<br> ...for as long as I live.<br> Love me for the time I have left,<br> then forget me.<br> Goodbye, George.<br> It seems like we always spend the<br> best part of our time saying goodbye.<br> "In my Father's house<br> of many mansions,"<br> "I go to prepare a place for you."<br> "And I will receive you unto myself<br> that where I am ye may be also."<br> You'll have to go now.<br> "I am the resurrection and the life.<br> He who believeth in me..."<br> Come on, son.<br> "And whosoever liveth and<br> believeth in me...shall never die."<br> So long, kid.<br> You're going to a better world<br> than this.<br> Goodbye, George. I'll be seein' you.<br>
