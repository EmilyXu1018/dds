                        This is not what we were led to expect.<br> We were to see the Arno.<br> The signora wrote<br> "South rooms with a view, close together".<br> Instead of which, we have north rooms<br> without a view and far apart.<br> Hurry and get dressed or we'll miss<br> our dinner on top of everything else.<br> She had no business doing it.<br> No business at all!<br> Any nook does for me,<br> but it is hard that you have no view.<br> No, you must have a view, too.<br> - Buonasera.<br> - Buonasera.<br> Miss Lavish,<br> what a recommendation for a place!<br> Indeed, Miss Alan, it is.<br> Between the squalor of London and the squalor<br> of Prato, there is a great gulf fixed.<br> By going off the track,<br> you get to know the country,<br> see the little towns,<br> Gubbio, Settignano, Galuzzo,<br> San Gimignano, Monteriggioni.<br> Their mixture of the primitive<br> with the classical is irresistible.<br> - Miss Pole?<br> - Yes, Mr. Emerson.<br> What is that you are taking?<br> It's not lemonade, is it?<br> - Yes, it is.<br> - Put it right away, Miss Pole.<br> Lemonade is very bad for the stomach.<br> Oh!<br> I shall tell the signora to give<br> the next south view available to you.<br> - Why not to you?<br> - No, I insist.<br> This meat has surely been boiled.<br> For stock. It's lost all its flavor.<br> Monteriggioni is not only quaint,<br> but one meets the Italians<br> in all their simplicity and charm.<br> Wasn't Monteriggioni<br> where we saw the cornflowers, Teresa?<br> An entire carpet of them. It was delightful!<br> I find the cornflower<br> the most delightful of flowers.<br> I prefer something bolder -<br> the reckless rose, the tempestuous tulip.<br> - Your mother would never forgive me.<br> - She'd want you to have it.<br> On no account. The view of the Arno is yours.<br> I don't know why we're arguing,<br> because we have no view.<br> I have a view. And so does George.<br> My son George here.<br> You can have our rooms.<br> We'll have yours. We can change.<br> - Why not?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - We could not impose on your kindness.<br> - Why?<br> - You see...<br> - Hush, Lucy.<br> Women like looking at a view.<br> Men don't. George, persuade them.<br> It's obvious they should have the rooms.<br> - Signora?<br> - No, thank you.<br> We could clear out in fifteen minutes.<br> These niceties go against common sense!<br> Every kind of sense. I don't care<br> what I see outside. My vision is within.<br> Here is where the birds sing<br> and where the sky is blue.<br> Come, Lucy.<br> Let them have the view if they want it.<br> Why not? George, go after them.<br> What an impossible person!<br> - He meant to be kind.<br> - I know how to deal with these people.<br> Charlotte, you dealed rudely.<br> You dealed wrongly.<br> This pensione is a failure.<br> Tomorrow we'll change.<br> - It's Mr. Beebe.<br> - Who?<br> Charlotte, we can't change now.<br> - Mr. Beebe.<br> - Don't you remember us?<br> Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch.<br> - We met at Tunbridge Wells.<br> - That very cold Easter.<br> How do you do?<br> - I heard you are to be our vicar.<br> - Yes, I move into the rectory in June.<br> We did feel so sorry for you<br> in the dining room.<br> - Mr. Emerson is so tactless.<br> - But he meant to be kind.<br> This old gentleman and his son<br> offered us their rooms with a view.<br> It was most indelicate!<br> But things that are indelicate<br> can sometimes be beautiful.<br> - Yes!<br> - I am the chaperone to my young cousin Lucy.<br> It would be serious if I put her under an<br> obligation to people of whom I know nothing.<br> - I wouldn't think much harm could have come.<br> - There.<br> You think I ought to have accepted?<br> You think I have been narrow-minded.<br> I never suggested that.<br> If you would allow me, I would be happy<br> to act as intermediary with Mr. Emerson.<br> He would not take advantage<br> nor expect gratitude.<br> He has rooms he does not value<br> and thinks you would.<br> Charlotte, please.<br> My wishes are unimportant<br> compared with yours.<br> I am only here through your kindness.<br> If you want me to turn these gentlemen<br> out of their rooms, I will.<br> Would you, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr...<br> - Emerson.<br> - Emerson...<br> ...we accept his offer?<br> I would like to thank your father personally<br> for his kindness.<br> You can't. He's in his bath.<br> I would have given the larger room to you,<br> but I happen to know<br> it was the young man's.<br> In my small way, I am a woman of the world.<br> And I know where things can lead.<br> Whatever does it mean?<br> Lucy, get dressed or the better part<br> of the day will be gone.<br> You said you liked cornflowers.<br> - So we brought you cornflowers.<br> - Oh, how kind!<br> They're your type of flowers.<br> They have your personality.<br> I'd like to see them in your hair.<br> There are no jewels more becoming to a lady.<br> May I say something rather daring?<br> Mr. Beebe, you sound like Miss Lavish.<br> - Are you writing a novel, too?<br> - If I were, you would be my heroine.<br> And I should write "If Miss Honeychurch<br> ever takes to live as she plays...<br> "...it will be very exciting,<br> both for us and for her."<br> Mother doesn't like me playing Beethoven.<br> She says I'm peevish afterwards.<br> Naturally, one would be stirred up.<br> Won't you play some more?<br> No, I think I'll go out.<br> Alone? Is that wise, Miss Honeychurch?<br> To be wise, one might have stayed at home.<br> I'll not go far. I promise.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Whatever's the matter with dear Miss Lucy?<br> I put it down to too much Beethoven.<br> I heard her beautiful playing.<br> Miss Catharine,<br> you have flowers in your hair.<br> Buongiorno, buongiorno, Ferdinando!<br> We salute thee.<br> The bronze came from Turkish cannons,<br> captured by the Knights of San Stefano.<br> Come along.<br> Stop a minute. Let that man go on<br> or I shall have to speak to him.<br> Oh, the British abroad!<br> I'd set an examination at Dover<br> and turn back any tourists who failed.<br> Miss, this sepolcro not very good.<br> You go see affresci di Giotto.<br> - Capella Peruzzi, Capella Bardivery good.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Giotto scolaro di Cimabue.<br> Kept the sheep on the mountain.<br> Make a picture of the sheep.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - I very... good speak English.<br> - Do go away, please.<br> - Capella Peruzzi, affresci di Giotto...<br> Cio tuttol<br> You see here these superb frescoes<br> by Giotto, depicting the life of St Francis.<br> On the left, there he is,<br> renouncing worldly goods.<br> And, on the right, the fourth Pope.<br> And here he is preaching to the bishops.<br> And there he is undergoing a... trial<br> by fire before the Sultan.<br> And here...<br> Ah, Mr. Eager, good morning.<br> I'm leading a little private tour of my own.<br> Here he is on his deathbed, surrounded...<br> Mr. Eager is our English chaplain<br> here in Florence.<br> ...now unhappily ruined by restoration,<br> is untroubled by the snares<br> of anatomy and perspective...<br> Look at that fat man! He must weigh as much<br> as I do, but he's floating like a balloon.<br> Remember that Santa Croce was built by faith<br> in the full fervor of medievalism.<br> Built by faith! That simply means<br> the workers weren't paid properly!<br> Pardon me. The chapel is somewhat small.<br> We will incommode you no longer.<br> Oh, I... Oh!<br> Mr. Eager, there's plenty of room<br> for all of us. You don't have to...<br> Oh, dear.<br> Gather round, everybody.<br> You may observe here in the Peruzzi Chapel,<br> as well as in the place<br> from which we've been expelled,<br> the special character of Giotto<br> among the great painters.<br> He was practical...<br> My poor boy has brains,<br> but he's very muddled.<br> But why should he be?<br> Well may you ask.<br> But think how he's been brought up -<br> free from the superstition<br> that leads men to hate in the name of God.<br> I must go...<br> I don't require you to fall in love<br> with my boy, but please help him.<br> If only one could stop him from brooding.<br> And on what? The things of the universe.<br> I don't believe in this world sorrow. Do you?<br> No, I don't. Not at all, Mr. Emerson.<br> Well, there you are.<br> Make my boy realize that,<br> at the side of the everlasting "why",<br> there is a "yes".<br> And a "yes" and a "yes"!<br> Has your son no particular hobby?<br> I forget my worries at the piano,<br> and collecting stamps helped my brother.<br> Excuse me. My cousin will be<br> most anxious if I don't get back.<br> - Poor girl.<br> - Poor girl?<br> I think myself most fortunate.<br> I'm very happy and having a splendid time.<br> Thank you very much. Goodbye.<br> Look at that adorable wine cart.<br> How he stares at us, dear simple soul!<br> I love these little dark alleys.<br> They're all peasants, you know. Come along.<br> I do declare we're lost.<br> No, Miss Bartlett,<br> you will not look into your Baedeker.<br> Two lone females in an unknown city,<br> that's what I call an adventure.<br> We will simply drift.<br> One always has to be wide open.<br> I think Miss Lucy is.<br> - Open to what, Miss Lavish?<br> - To physical sensation.<br> I'll let you into a secret.<br> I have my eye on your cousin.<br> For a character in your novel?<br> The young English girl, transfigured by Italy.<br> And why should she not be transfigured?<br> It happened to the Goths.<br> Signorina?<br> The smell!<br> A true Florentine smell. Inhale, my dear.<br> Deeper.<br> Every city, let me tell you, has its own smell.<br> Grazie.<br> How are you now?<br> Perfectly well. Absolutely well.<br> Then, let's go home.<br> There's no point in our stopping.<br> How very kind you've been.<br> I can go alone. Thank you.<br> - My photographs!<br> - What photographs?<br> I must have dropped them<br> in the square. Would you be so kind...?<br> Miss Honeychurch!<br> You're not fit enough to go alone.<br> - I am.<br> - No, you're not!<br> - But...<br> - Then I don't get the photographs.<br> Besides, that way,<br> you'd have to fly over the wall.<br> Sit down and don't move until I come back.<br> Isn't it extraordinary?<br> I mean, Italians are so kind, so lovable,<br> and yet at the same time so violent.<br> Mr. Emerson?<br> I've never been so ashamed.<br> I can't think what came over me.<br> It's perfectly natural.<br> I nearly fainted myself.<br> Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.<br> And... I want to ask you a great favor.<br> You know how silly people are.<br> Gossiping.<br> Ladies especially, I'm afraid.<br> - You understand what I mean?<br> - No.<br> I mean, would you not mention it to anyone,<br> my foolish behavior.<br> What was that?<br> I believe it was my photographs!<br> I didn't know what to do with them.<br> They were covered with blood.<br> There. Now I've told you.<br> Something tremendous has happened.<br> Well, thank you... again.<br> How quickly accidents happen.<br> Then one returns to the old life.<br> I don't.<br> I mean... something's happened to me.<br> And to you.<br> - No!<br> - She is my sister.<br> - We ought not to allow this.<br> - They're doing no harm.<br> You can't object in such a landscape.<br> As long as she is his sister.<br> So, Miss Honeychurch, you're traveling.<br> As a student of art?<br> - No, I'm afraid not.<br> - As a student of human nature like myself?<br> - I'm here as a tourist.<br> - Indeed?<br> We residents sometimes pity<br> you poor tourists not a little.<br> Handed about like parcels<br> from Venice to Florence to Rome,<br> unconscious of anything outside Baedeker,<br> anxious to get done and go on elsewhere.<br> I abhor Baedeker.<br> I'd fling every copy in the Arno.<br> Towns, rivers, palaces,<br> all mixed up in an inextricable whirl.<br> Over there, Miss Honeychurch,<br> the villa of my dear friend Lady Laverstock,<br> at present busy<br> with a Fra Angelico definitive study.<br> And, on your left - no, just there -<br> Mr. Henry Burridge lives.<br> An American of the best type. So rare!<br> Doubtless you know his monographs<br> in "Medieval Byways".<br> Your father, Mr. Emerson, is a journalist?<br> - He used to be.<br> - He's retired? And you, yourself?<br> I'm on the railways.<br> You know the American girl<br> in "Punch" who says to her father,<br> "Say, Poppa, what did we see in Rome?"<br> The father replies,<br> "Guess Rome was where we saw the yellow dog."<br> Yellow dog!<br> There's traveling for you!<br> What?! Stop at once!<br> I'm not having this.<br> Ferma la carrozza subitol<br> Have we bolted?<br> What? Is Phaethon misbehaving<br> with his Persephone?<br> - Please, I'll deal with them.<br> - Leave them.<br> Do we find happiness<br> so often that we should turn it away?<br> Scendal<br> Beauty!<br> Espoirl<br> Is that your son?<br> Could that be the silent, dour George?<br> He's saying his creed.<br> One more lump,<br> if I might trouble you, Mr. Beebe.<br> Joy!<br> Beauty!<br> Joy...!<br> He's declaring the eternal "yes".<br> And a spoon, if there is one.<br> Love!<br> - What's that?<br> - The gentlemen are doubtless having a game.<br> Why don't you join them, dear?<br> I want to stop here with you.<br> Observe my foresight. I never venture forth<br> without my mackintosh squares.<br> At any time, one may have to sit<br> on damp ground or cold marble.<br> Lucy, you have the other one.<br> Come on, I insist. The ground will do for me.<br> I have not had rheumatism for years,<br> and if I feel a twinge I'll stand up.<br> And she never went back to Weybridge?<br> Her friend had to return without her.<br> She remained at Monteriano.<br> And did she really...?<br> No, no. Don't be alarmed. This is not a cold.<br> Just a slight cough.<br> I've had it for three days.<br> Nothing to do with sitting on the ground.<br> I shall go and find Mr. Beebe.<br> Oh, do, dear. He will be so pleased.<br> - Did she really marry this Italian?<br> - In the church at Monteriano.<br> A youth. Ten years younger than herself.<br> Eleanor!<br> PUCCINI'S "CHI IL BEL SOGNO<br> DI DORETTA" FROM "LA RONDINE")<br> Excuse me.<br> Dove Mr. Beebe?<br> Buoni uomini?<br> I think there is something<br> in the Italian landscape<br> which inclines<br> even the most stolid to romance.<br> It reminds me somewhat<br> of the country around Shropshire.<br> Where I once spent a holiday<br> at the home of my friend Miss Apesbury.<br> And I divine it, Charlotte.<br> You had an adventure there.<br> Vain to deny it.<br> Lucy!<br> Mr. Eager, do come and join us.<br> Miss Honeychurch is feeling unwell.<br> Andiamo.<br> Andiamol<br> George. George.<br> - Aren't you coming with us?<br> - I'll walk.<br> Are you sure?<br> Courage, Miss Honeychurch, and faith.<br> Do you suppose this display is called<br> into existence to extinguish you or me?<br> Even scientifically, the chances<br> against being struck are enormous.<br> The steel knives that might attract<br> the current are in the other carriage.<br> What is to be done?<br> How do you propose to silence him?<br> - The driver?<br> - My dear girl, no. Mr. George Emerson.<br> I don't wish to be uncharitable,<br> but I know he will talk.<br> He will not. He never talks.<br> One's lucky to get<br> as much as a "yes" or "no" out of him.<br> Unfortunately, I have met the type before.<br> They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.<br> Exploits?<br> Very well. I'll speak to him.<br> Oh, no, my dear Lucy.<br> I think it is for me to do that.<br> He should have been here<br> at least an hour ago.<br> Don't stand there, dear.<br> You will be seen from the outside.<br> The moment he comes, I shall face him.<br> No, my dear, you will do no such thing.<br> My poor dear girl, you are so young!<br> You've always lived among such nice people.<br> You cannot realize what men can be.<br> This afternoon, if I had not arrived,<br> what would have happened?<br> - I can't think.<br> - Answer me, Lucia.<br> What would have happened had I not appeared?<br> You did appear!<br> Oh, I have vexed you at every turn.<br> It's true.<br> I am too old for you. And too dull.<br> It will be a push to catch the morning train.<br> I have failed in my duty to your mother.<br> She will never forgive me when you tell her.<br> Come away from the window!<br> She will certainly blame me<br> when she hears of it.<br> Certainly.<br> And deservedly.<br> - Why need Mother hear of it?<br> - Well, you tell her everything. Don't you?<br> I suppose I do, generally.<br> There's such a beautiful confidence<br> between you.<br> One would hate to break it.<br> And, as I've said before, I am to blame.<br> I wouldn't want Mother to think so.<br> She will think so... if you tell her.<br> I shall never speak of it to Mother or anyone.<br> We'll both be as silent as the grave.<br> You'd better get to bed, dear.<br> We have to make an early start.<br> But, of course, we have not had a full week.<br> I reserved them for a week<br> like you wrote you wanted.<br> Yes, but we've only had half a week,<br> so I calculate we owe you half the price.<br> I'm the loser.<br> I could have let them rooms five times over.<br> Buonasera. Grazie.<br> Lucy! We must get packed immediately!<br> I wish to have a word with you,<br> Mr. Emerson, in the drawing room, please.<br> - You shouldn't peep.<br> - Cecil asked my permission,<br> but he can't manage without me.<br> - Nor me.<br> - You?<br> - He asked my permission also.<br> - Whatever did you say?<br> - I said no.<br> - What?!<br> It's the way he put it - wouldn't it be<br> a splendid thing for Lucy if he married her?<br> Wasn't I off my head with joy?<br> So I said no, I wasn't.<br> Ridiculous child. You think you're so holy<br> and truthful, but it's just conceit.<br> Look out!<br> I promessi sposel<br> - She has accepted me.<br> - I'm so glad.<br> Dear Cecil, what joy!<br> - Well, welcome as one of the family.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Mother?<br> - Lucy.<br> Freddy!<br> - Mr. Beebe.<br> - Thank you, Mary.<br> Hello, Mr. Vyse, I've come for tea.<br> Do you suppose I shall get it?<br> Food is the one thing one does get here.<br> - What an extraordinary thing!<br> - One of Freddy's bones.<br> He's terrible. A most unpromising youth.<br> So unlike his sister.<br> You think his sister is promising?<br> I have a pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.<br> Is it not odd that she should play Beethoven<br> with such passion and live so quietly?<br> I suspect that one day...<br> ...music and life will mingle.<br> Then she will be wonderful in both.<br> I trust that day is at hand.<br> She has just promised to marry me.<br> I'm sorry if I've given you a shock.<br> I'm awfully sorry.<br> I'd no idea you were so intimate with her.<br> You should have stopped me.<br> Shall we join the others?<br> Congratulations.<br> Blessings. Your vicar's benediction.<br> I want you to be supremely happy.<br> And supremely good,<br> both as man and wife, mother and father.<br> And now I want my tea.<br> Just in time. How dare you be so serious!<br> - Summer Street will never be the same.<br> - It's too small for anyone like ourselves.<br> It might attract the wrong type.<br> The trains have improved so.<br> Fatal. What are five miles<br> from the station these days?<br> Sir Harry, how about spinsters as tenants?<br> Most certainly!<br> That is, if they are gentlewomen.<br> Indeed they are. Miss Teresa<br> and Miss Catharine Alan. I met them in Italy.<br> Sir Harry, beware of these gentlewomen.<br> Only let to a man.<br> Provided, of course, he's clean.<br> You'd love the Miss Alans.<br> I don't think I'd like anyone at that pensione.<br> Wasn't there a lady novelist<br> and a free-thinking father and son?<br> I have no profession.<br> My attitude - quite indefensible -<br> is that, if I trouble no one, I may do as I like.<br> It is, I dare say, an example of my decadence.<br> You're very fortunate.<br> Leisure is a wonderful opportunity.<br> Don't slouch, Lucy. Go and talk<br> to Mrs. Pool. Ask her about her leg.<br> Would Cecil and I be missed<br> if we went for a walk?<br> I think it would be all right.<br> Don't get your frock muddied.<br> It's disgusting the way an engagement<br> is regarded as public property.<br> All those old women smirking.<br> One has to go through it.<br> They won't notice us much next time.<br> But their whole attitude is wrong.<br> An engagement -<br> horrid word in the first place -<br> is a private matter<br> and should be regarded as such.<br> Oh.<br> - There's your philosophizing parson.<br> - Don't you like Mr. Beebe?<br> I never said so.<br> I consider him far above the average.<br> Mr. Beebe, I've had a wonderful idea.<br> I'm going to write to our Miss Alans<br> and ask them to take Sir Harry's villa.<br> Sir Harry deserves a tenant<br> as vulgar as himself.<br> Oh, Mr. Vyse, he's really very nice.<br> Gentlewomen! Yuck!<br> Acting the little god down here<br> with his patronage<br> and his sham aesthetics,<br> and everyone is taken in.<br> I'll write to them,<br> and if you'd also send a word?<br> Certainly. A highly suitable<br> addition to our little community.<br> Goodness, how cross you are!<br> It was that miserable tea party<br> and all those dreadful people.<br> And not being alone with you.<br> Hmm.<br> Italy and London are the places<br> where I feel I truly belong.<br> I am something of an Inglese Italianato.<br> E un diavolo incarnato.<br> You know the proverb?<br> I somehow think you feel<br> more at home with me in a room.<br> Never in the real country like this.<br> I think you're right. When I do think of you,<br> it is always in a room.<br> This is the Sacred Lake.<br> Very picturesque, but hardly a lake.<br> More of a puddle.<br> Freddy loves to bathe here.<br> He's very fond of it.<br> And you?<br> I used to bathe here, too.<br> Until I was found out.<br> - Lucy.<br> - Hmm?<br> Yes, I suppose we ought to be going.<br> I want to ask you something<br> that I have never asked before.<br> What, Cecil?<br> Yes?<br> I have never kissed you.<br> No. You haven't.<br> May I now?<br> Well, of course you may, Cecil.<br> You might before. I can't run at you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Mother's right. Those people<br> Charlotte and I met at the pensione,<br> they were all rather extraordinary.<br> has a villa in Summer Street<br> for which he needs a tenant.<br> - I immediately thought of you.<br> - "The house has the added attraction<br> "that it stands exactly across the road<br> from the Reverend Beebe's church.<br> "I told him of my plan to lure you hither,<br> and he is in complete agreement<br> "and says he is writing today to urge you<br> to consider our little corner of Surrey.<br> "Yours sincerely, Lucy Honeychurch." There.<br> - Goodnight.<br> - Goodnight.<br> Oh, dear.<br> - Goodnight.<br> - Goodnight.<br> Goodnight. See you Friday.<br> - That will be all, Rose. Thank you.<br> - Thank you, madam.<br> Goodnight, Rose.<br> Make Lucy one of us.<br> Lucy's becoming wonderful.<br> Her music always was wonderful.<br> But she's purging off that Honeychurch taint.<br> You know what I mean.<br> Not quoting the servants<br> or asking how the pudding is made.<br> Mind you marry her next January.<br> Her music, the style of her...<br> how she kept to Schubert when,<br> like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.<br> Schubert was right for this evening.<br> Mother, I shall have our children<br> educated just like Lucy.<br> Bring them up among honest country folk<br> for freshness,<br> send them to Italy for... subtlety.<br> And not till then bring them to London.<br> Not a day beyond January.<br> Cecil... darling.<br> So, you do love me, little thing?<br> Lucy!<br> I want to show her this letter<br> from the Miss Alans.<br> The tiresome Miss Alans.<br> I hate their "if"-ing and "but"-ing.<br> Well, now they're really coming.<br> I had a letter from Miss Teresa<br> asking how often the butcher called.<br> My reply impressed her favorably. Lucy?<br> Go for her. Get her round the shins.<br> - Freddy, be careful!<br> - You really are savages, you know.<br> Impossible to make oneself heard.<br> Don't you want to hear about the Miss Alans?<br> - Who?<br> - Sir Harry's new tenants.<br> - That wasn't the name.<br> - Wasn't whose name?<br> Sir Harry's tenants.<br> I met him this morning and he said,<br> "I have procured desirable tenants."<br> I said, "Hurray,"<br> and slapped him on the back.<br> - Exactly. The Miss Alans.<br> - More like Anderson.<br> I knew there'd be another muddle.<br> I'm always right.<br> Only Freddy's muddle,<br> who doesn't even know their name.<br> Yes, I do. I've got it. It was Emerson.<br> - What a weathercock Sir Harry is.<br> - I hope they're the right kind of people.<br> Yes, Freddy,<br> there is a right and a wrong sort.<br> These must be all right.<br> They're friends of Cecil's.<br> - Cecil?<br> - So you can all call in perfect safety.<br> - Cecil?!<br> - We met some Emersons in Florence.<br> The oddest people, Mrs. Honeychurch,<br> but we rather liked them.<br> Emerson's a common enough name.<br> "So really desirable. I've telegraphed them."<br> Don't be silly, Freddy. You always overdo it.<br> A most remarkable father and son.<br> Father's something of a radical.<br> The son, full of possibilities.<br> Don't move.<br> Stay where you are. "Ginevra de Benci"!<br> Did you know you were a Leonardo,<br> smiling at things beyond our ken?<br> What's this about Sir Harry's new tenants?<br> I have found him tenants for his Cissie Villa.<br> I've won a great victory for the comic muse.<br> After all the trouble I took over the Miss Alans.<br> Of course I'd prefer friends of yours...<br> Friends of mine? The joke is to come.<br> They're strangers<br> I met in the National Gallery.<br> They had been to Italy.<br> A father and son. The oddest couple.<br> In the course of conversazione,<br> they said they wanted a country cottage.<br> A simple burrow<br> where they could smell the earth.<br> Of course, London has its own character,<br> but we've a longing for green things growing,<br> don't we, George?<br> The sweetness of the English countryside...<br> of wet hedgerows<br> with birds singing inside them.<br> I know we should make<br> our heaven and earth where we are.<br> However, I fear I've faltered<br> and need some help from outside.<br> Well, in short, sir, what I seek is a country<br> cottage where George can come at weekends.<br> I happen to know of just the place.<br> Not exactly a cottage, more... a villa.<br> Dear sir, I implore you...<br> If you'd give me your card...<br> I fear we have no card,<br> but George will write down the address.<br> Sir Harry Otway. It is in Surrey,<br> a place called Summer Street.<br> Summer Street! I've dreamed of Summer Street.<br> It will teach that snob Sir Harry a lesson.<br> The classes should mix, there should be<br> intermarriage. I believe in democracy.<br> No, you don't!<br> You don't know what the word means.<br> It isn't fair! I've probably met them before.<br> Perfectly fair if it punishes a snob.<br> I blame you. You had no business<br> to undo my work about the Miss Alans.<br> You've scored off Sir Harry, but at my expense.<br> It was most disloyal of you.<br> Temper, Lucy, temper. Please!<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello.<br> - I've brought someone to see you.<br> - One minute.<br> Byron. Exactly.<br> "A Shropshire Lad".<br> Never heard of it.<br> "The Way of All Flesh".<br> Never heard of it.<br> Hello? George reads German.<br> I'm certain that's old Emerson.<br> What are those people doing? Hello!<br> Wait on, Mr. Beebe.<br> - This is Mr. Honeychurch.<br> - How do you do?<br> How do you do? Come in.<br> Come and have a bathe!<br> I'd like that.<br> What a conversational opening!<br> "How do you do? Come and have a bathe."<br> Emerson, this is Honeychurch.<br> You remember his sister.<br> Oh, yes. How do you do? Glad to see you.<br> Very glad to hear your sister is marrying.<br> I'm sure she'll be... happy.<br> We know Mr. Vyse, too.<br> He's been very... kind.<br> Go and bathe. It will do you good.<br> Then all come back for some tea.<br> - Do you really want this bathe?<br> - Yes, I've said so.<br> Bye, Emerson.<br> Bring some milk and honey<br> and... er, cakes. Cakes!<br> Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch!<br> As a matter of fact,<br> coincidence is much rarer than we suppose.<br> For example, on reflection,<br> it's not coincidental that you're here now.<br> I have reflected. It's fate. Everything is fate.<br> You've not reflected.<br> Let me cross-examine you.<br> Where did you meet Mr. Vyse?<br> - The National Gallery.<br> - Looking at Italian art.<br> You see? You talk of coincidence and fate.<br> You're naturally drawn to things Italian,<br> as are we and all our friends.<br> That narrows the field immeasurably.<br> It is fate, but call it Italy<br> if it pleases you, Vicar.<br> Are you bathing, Mr. Beebe?<br> - Don't be shy!<br> - Why not?<br> Oh, it's wonderful! Simply ripping.<br> Hurry up, Emerson!<br> - Come along, Mr. Beebe!<br> - I may as well wash, too.<br> Here goes.<br> Race you round it!<br> "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br> a stately pleasure dome decree..."<br> You've gone too far! Really, I...<br> I have a boot!<br> And some trousers...<br> Graces alive!<br> - Come this way immediately!<br> - Who were those unfortunate people?<br> This way, Mrs. Honeychurch. Follow me.<br> Oh, dears. Look away!<br> Poor Mr. Beebe, too!<br> You're treading on me!<br> It is you! Why not have a comfortable bath<br> at home with hot and cold laid on?<br> - Mother!<br> - You're in no position to argue. Come, Lucy.<br> Oh, look! No, don't look! Poor Mr. Beebe!<br> Poor Charlotte.<br> Poor, poor Charlotte!<br> Standard reaction to any letter<br> from Cousin Charlotte.<br> Poor, poor Charlotte!<br> This is serious.<br> Her boiler is to be had out and the cistern<br> cleaned and all kinds of to-doing.<br> I think we should ask her to stay.<br> Give her a holiday while the plumbers finish.<br> No! We're squeezed to death<br> with Freddy's friend and Minnie Beebe.<br> Freddy, must you?<br> The truth is, you don't like Charlotte.<br> Well, she gets on my nerves.<br> The time she met Cecil,<br> she drove him quite frantic.<br> So, please, don't worry us this last summer.<br> Spoil us by not asking her to come.<br> Hear, hear. We vote no Miss Bartlett.<br> This isn't very kind of you two.<br> You have each other and poor Charlotte...<br> - Again! Poor Charlotte.<br> ...has the water turned off and plumbers.<br> Strike the concertina's melancholy string<br> Blow the spirit-stirring harp like anything<br> Let the piano's martial blast<br> Rouse the echoes of the past<br> They played their next sonata, let me see<br> Medulla oblongata, key of G...<br> However, we're in E flat.<br> - Wasn't it any good?<br> - It's lovely, dear.<br> Then they began to sing<br> That extremely lovely thing<br> Scherzando ma non troppo, P, P, P<br> Scherzando ma non troppo, P, P, P<br> Is anything the matter with Cecil?<br> Because otherwise, I cannot account for him.<br> Whenever I speak, he winces.<br> I see him, Lucy. It's useless to contradict me.<br> No doubt, I am not artistic<br> nor literary nor intellectual.<br> Your father bought the drawing room<br> furniture, and we must put up with it.<br> Cecil doesn't mean to be uncivil.<br> He explained. It's ugly things<br> that upset him. He's not uncivil to people.<br> Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?<br> You can't expect a really musical person<br> to appreciate comic songs as we do.<br> Must he sneer and spoil everyone's pleasure?<br> - Go and dress, dear.<br> - All right, Mother.<br> Sunday week, I want to ask<br> George Emerson up for some tennis.<br> - Oh, no, Freddy...<br> - Oh, he's topping. He's spiffing!<br> George Emerson is simply ripping!<br> What a noise you're making.<br> Freddy, let Lucy go.<br> Hook me behind.<br> Need we have Charlotte?<br> We needn't.<br> - And now Freddy wants to ask the Emersons.<br> - Well, he needn't.<br> And you're not pleased with Cecil.<br> Kiss me.<br> Well, of course, if you want Charlotte<br> to come, with her boiler and everything...<br> She's been so kind to me.<br> Kiss me again.<br> - Would you like it closed?<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> - Pleasure.<br> Oh, porter! Could you...?<br> The ticket says Dorking.<br> That was the last station.<br> How very vexing! I shall have to get a cab.<br> Mr. Emerson. What are you doing here?<br> My father lives here.<br> I've come for the weekend.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Oh, Lucy, I met him at the station.<br> I had no idea. Oh, my poor Lucia!<br> My dear Marian, what a stupid blunder.<br> You'll never forgive me.<br> Oh!<br> - Freddy, pay the cab.<br> - No, I must. I absolutely insist.<br> Oh, how do you do, Mr. Vyse?<br> - And Mr. Floyd, a friend of Freddy's.<br> - I insist I pay for my cab.<br> - And this is Minnie, Mr. Beebe's niece.<br> - Grant me that.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I insist, absolutely.<br> All right.<br> Five shillings and a bob for the driver.<br> We all have our foibles,<br> and mine is prompt settling of accounts.<br> Does anyone have any change?<br> How much is...?<br> Who do I give the sovereign to?<br> - Toss for it, Honeychurch.<br> - All right.<br> No. I know I'm a spoilsport,<br> but it would make me wretched.<br> It would be robbing the one who lost.<br> Freddy owes me 15 shillings, so it works out<br> all right if you give the pound to me.<br> Fifteen shillings to you? How so, Mr. Vyse?<br> Because fifteen<br> and five shillings make a pound.<br> Why is Mr. Vyse taking the quid?<br> No, thank you!<br> - Have some tea.<br> - What about Mr. Floyd's ten shi...?<br> And why doesn't she pay the bob<br> for the driver?<br> A shilling for the driver.<br> Of course. How kind of you to remind me.<br> Does anyone have change for half a crown?<br> Cecil, give that sovereign to me.<br> Mary can change it,<br> and we'll start from the beginning.<br> Oh, dear. I am sorry. What a nuisance I am!<br> Poor Charlotte!<br> Mary, have you got any change?<br> For a sovereign.<br> Have you told him about him?<br> No, I haven't, nor anyone.<br> I promised you I shouldn't.<br> Here's your money.<br> It's all shillings except two half crowns.<br> You can settle your debt nicely now.<br> How dreadful. How more than dreadful<br> if Mr. Vyse should hear from another source.<br> There is no other source.<br> - George would tell Mr. Emerson.<br> - He would tell no one.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Because I know. Shall we go out?<br> Dear, a moment. We may not have this chance<br> again. Have you spoken to him yet?<br> I have seen him.<br> Stop thinking he admires me or any nonsense<br> of that sort. He doesn't. Not one straw.<br> Freddy, stop it!<br> No, poor Minnie. No, not me. Get off!<br> Lucy! Lucy! What's that book?<br> Who's been leaving books out to spoil?<br> - It's only a library book of Cecil's.<br> - Well, pick it up.<br> It's a special collection.<br> I forget what for, but I beg,<br> no vulgar clinking ha'pennies in the plate.<br> Make sure Minnie has a sixpence.<br> Where is the child?<br> Dear, I'm so sorry, I don't seem<br> to have any small change. Could you...?<br> Yes, easily. Gracious,<br> how smart you look! What a lovely frock.<br> Go on.<br> Goodbye. Be good.<br> "'No place on earth as glorious<br> as this where love is spoken face to face.<br> "So he cried, 'Utter rapture! The silvered<br> twilight, the wraith-like swallows,<br> "'the perfume of the cooling earth all fill me<br> with inutterable and inestimable bliss.'<br> "And so, locked in mortal combat,<br> they brought to life the eternal...<br> "They brought to life the eternal battle<br> where men stand face to face<br> "to slowly gird, to bravely fight,<br> to stoutly dare..."<br> Listen, Lucy.

Nothing's funnier<br> than silly things read aloud.<br> Mr. Emerson finds us frivolous.<br> Look for tennis balls, Mr. Emerson.<br> - Do I have to?<br> - No, of course not.<br> It's in chapter two. Find me chapter two.<br> - Give it here.<br> - No, it's the silliest thing.<br> Come on.<br> - Cecil!<br> - Thank you.<br> A-ha.<br> "Afar off, the towers of Florence.<br> "And she wandered as though in a dream<br> through the wavering sea of barley,<br> "touched with crimson stains of poppies.<br> "All unobserved, he came to her."<br> Isn't it immortal?<br> "There came from his lips no wordy<br> protestations such as formal lovers use.<br> "No eloquence was his, nor did he need it.<br> He simply enfolded her in his manly arms..."<br> No, this isn't the bit. It's further on.<br> - Shall we go in to tea?<br> - By all means.<br> Excuse me.<br> Charlotte, a minute.<br> Cecil, ask Mary for sandwiches.<br> I'll be with you in a moment.<br> Do you know Miss Lavish's novel?<br> There's a scene in it - the hero and heroine<br> make love. Do you know about that?<br> Do you know about it?<br> They're on a hillside<br> and Florence is in the distance.<br> There are poppies and a barley field.<br> It can't be coincidence.<br> How could you tell her?!<br> Oh, Lucy! Oh, dearest girl!<br> She hasn't put that in her novel?<br> Never, never more<br> shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.<br> So you did tell. Why?!<br> When you wouldn't even let me tell Mother?<br> Cecil read it to me.<br> And that man insulted me again<br> behind Cecil's back.<br> Why did you tell her? What made you?!<br> Even if you forgive me, I shall never<br> forgive myself... till my dying day.<br> Go and call him.<br> - Call Mr. Vyse?<br> - No. The other one.<br> I'll deal with him myself.<br> You missed a good match, Miss Bartlett.<br> Charlotte, please stay.<br> Mr. Emerson, leave this house<br> and don't come back as long as I'm here.<br> - I can't.<br> - No discussion.<br> Go, please.<br> I don't want to call in Mr. Vyse.<br> You mean to marry that man?<br> - You're being ridiculous.<br> - I'd have held back if Cecil was different.<br> But he's the sort who can't know<br> anyone intimately, least of all a woman.<br> He doesn't know what a woman is.<br> He wants you for a possession,<br> to look at like a painting or an ivory box.<br> Something to own and to display.<br> He doesn't want you to be real,<br> to think and to live. He doesn't love you.<br> But I love you. I want you<br> to have your own thoughts and ideas,<br> even when I hold you in my arms.<br> Miss Bartlett, you wouldn't stop us,<br> not if you understood.<br> It's our last chance.<br> Do you understand how lucky people are<br> to find what's right for them?<br> It's such a blessing, don't you see?<br> And the fact I love Cecil and shall be<br> his wife shortly is of no importance?<br> This tremendous thing has happened<br> between us and it means...<br> it means nothing must hinder us ever again.<br> You have to understand that.<br> - I've no idea what you mean.<br> - Everyone must understand.<br> And you must leave.<br> It was wrong of me to listen to you.<br> But you haven't been listening.<br> If you had, you would know!<br> - Leave at once. Now.<br> - Lucy...<br> - No, I will not listen to one more word.<br> - My dears, do stop.<br> Haven't you done enough?<br> Don't interfere again.<br> - It's useless. Let me go, Miss Bartlett.<br> - Let Mr. Emerson go, Charlotte.<br> - I shall never forgive myself.<br> - You always say that,<br> but you always do forgive yourself.<br> Why does Italy make lady novelists<br> reach such summits of absurdity?<br> Lucy, it's still light enough for another set.<br> - Mr. Emerson has had to go.<br> - What a nuisance.<br> I say, Cecil, do play, there's a good chap.<br> Just this once. It's Floyd's last day.<br> Freddy, as you remarked this morning,<br> some chaps are good for nothing but books.<br> I plead guilty to being such a chap.<br> Because I wouldn't play tennis?<br> I never do play tennis. I never could.<br> Forget tennis. It was just the last straw.<br> I'm sorry, I can't marry you.<br> One day you'll be glad I said so.<br> - We're too different.<br> - But I...<br> I love you.<br> And... I did think you loved me.<br> I did not.<br> I thought I did at first. I'm sorry.<br> As for your loving me, you don't, not really.<br> You don't. It's only as something else.<br> As something you own. A painting, a Leonardo.<br> I don't want to be a Leonardo,<br> I want to be myself.<br> Oh, let's not go on now.<br> I'll only say things<br> that will make me unhappy afterwards.<br> You don't love me, evidently.<br> I dare say you're right not to...<br> ...but it would help a little,<br> hurt a little less, if I knew why.<br> Because...<br> ...you can't know anyone intimately,<br> least of all a woman.<br> I don't mean exactly that,<br> but you will go on asking questions.<br> You wrap yourself up in art,<br> and want to wrap me up,<br> so I'm breaking it off.<br> It's true.<br> True, on the whole.<br> You're so different tonight, like a different<br> person speaking with a new voice.<br> What do you mean? If you think<br> I love someone else, you're mistaken.<br> Of course I don't. I only meant that...<br> there was a... force in you<br> I hadn't known of up to now.<br> If a girl breaks off her engagement,<br> everyone thinks, "Oh, she has someone else."<br> It's disgusting, brutal!<br> Forgive me if I say stupid things.<br> My brain has gone to pieces.<br> I think we'd better go to bed, if you don't mind.<br> Let me do that for you.<br> I must actually thank you for what you've done.<br> For showing me what I really am.<br> I admire your courage.<br> Will you shake hands?<br> Of course I will, Cecil.<br> Goodnight.<br> I'm sorry about it.<br> Thank you for taking it so well.<br> Since the days are chillier now<br> and we've not, alas, a home of our own,<br> my sister feels we might benefit<br> by travel to a warmer clime.<br> The doctor has ordered her special bread,<br> but we can take that with us.<br> It is only getting first into a steamer<br> and then a train.<br> - Hello. So you're off, Mr. Vyse?<br> - Yes.<br> I've come to show Miss Honeychurch<br> a letter from our friends the Miss Alans.<br> "Since Florence did my sister so much good,<br> we think we should try Athens this winter."<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> The Parthenon, the frieze of Phydias.<br> - Have you ever met these Miss Alans?<br> - Never.<br> Then you cannot appreciate<br> the romance of this visit.<br> I've never been myself,<br> nor do I have any plans to go.<br> Altogether too big for our little lot,<br> don't you agree? Got any matches?<br> Thank you.<br> You're quite right.<br> Greece is not for our little lot.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Mr. Beebe! Matches!<br> Matches!<br> Cecil's hard hit. Lucy won't marry him.<br> - When?<br> - Late last night. I must go.<br> - Will they want me to go down?<br> - Yes. Goodbye.<br> All right, Powell.<br> No, Charlotte.<br> Not the scissors, not when my hands are full.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Beebe?<br> - Good gracious! What a mess things are!<br> - Yes.<br> Everyone's so horrid today, Uncle Arthur.<br> Let's go out to tea.<br> Good idea. Get your hat and coat<br> and I'll take you.<br> I'll take Minnie to the Beehive Tavern.<br> Care to join us, Miss Bartlett?<br> Oh, yes, Charlotte! I don't mind.<br> No. You have no one to help.<br> My services are better than nothing.<br> Oh, dear, Marian. I'm so sorry.<br> A delightful letter from the Miss Alans.<br> They're going to Greece. I'll read you some.<br> "Dear Mr. Beebe, I doubt we shall go<br> any further than Athens,<br> "but, if you know of a good pensione<br> in Constantinople, we should be so grateful."<br> Isn't that delightful? I do believe<br> they'll end by going round the world.<br> Delightful.<br> Miss Honeychurch, your brother has told me.<br> - Did he?<br> - I needn't say it will go no further.<br> Mother... Charlotte... Cecil... Freddy... you...<br> If I may say so,<br> I'm certain you've done the right thing.<br> Tell me more of the Miss Alans.<br> How splendid of them to go abroad.<br> I want them to start from Venice and then<br> go by cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast.<br> - Did Freddy say he'd drive straight back?<br> - No, he didn't.<br> I hope he won't gossip.<br> How splendid of them to go.<br> I wish they'd take me.<br> Would your mother spare you?<br> She must. I simply must go away.<br> I have to. Don't you see I have to go away?<br> Charlotte, the Miss Alans<br> are going to Constantinople.<br> No, only to Athens.<br> I've longed to go to Constantinople...<br> Athens, I mean.<br> In lieu of Constantinople,<br> could not we lure you to tea at the Beehive?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Oh, well, Minnie, you and I must eat alone.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.<br> - You must persuade Mother.<br> - What?<br> Don't you see? I must go somewhere. Anywhere!<br> I must get away, far, before it's known.<br> - What?<br> - That I've broken off my engagement.<br> - He mustn't get any ideas.<br> - You mean Mr. Emerson?<br> Charlotte, how slow you are.<br> There must be no gossip<br> at Summer Street, but to go as far as Greece!<br> I thought you'd be the first to go to Mother<br> and say Lucy must go to Greece.<br> Lucy, are you absolutely sure?<br> I only want to do what is right for you.<br> I'm telling you what's right.<br> Don't argue, do it!<br> All right.<br> Thank you, Freddy.<br> Why does she look like that?<br> - Like what?<br> - Like Charlotte Bartlett.<br> Because... she is Charlotte Bartlett.<br> Stop thine ear against the singer<br> From the red gold, keep thy finger<br> The tune's fine, but the words are rotten.<br> - Marian?<br> - Oh, Charlotte!<br> - Lucy has a plan.<br> - Isn't this a tragedy?<br> I get one thing tied up<br> and another thing falls over.<br> - The Misses Alan are going to Greece.<br> - Good luck to them.<br> Lucy would like to join them<br> as far as Athens.<br> - She'd what?!<br> - And on to Delphi if the roads are safe.<br> Vacant heart and hand and eye<br> Easy live and quiet die<br> Vacant heart and hand and eye<br> Easy live and quiet die<br> You can take all those, but leave me Thoreau<br> till I go. I need him by me now.<br> It's an ugly house. We never liked it.<br> I mustn't miss the train.<br> The removers can do the rest.<br> Oh, I...<br> No. I don't want you straining your back.<br> I won't be down at the weekend.<br> There's no point.<br> I'll come to take you back to town<br> the week after.<br> Paper soap is a great help towards<br> freshening up one's face on a train.<br> But you know about these matters,<br> and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.<br> A gentleman is such a standby.<br> It's so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you.<br> Perhaps he will join you later.<br> - Or does work keep him in London?<br> - We shall meet him when he sees you off.<br> No one will see Lucy off. She doesn't like it.<br> Really?<br> But, in this case...<br> - You aren't going?<br> - Yes, we've a train to catch.<br> - It's been such a pleasure to meet you.<br> - We will write you often<br> and send pretty cards from every place.<br> - Thank you so much for taking her.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> Well, we got through that time.<br> Yes, and were seen through,<br> which is most unpleasant.<br> I cannot understand<br> this hole and corner business.<br> You got rid of Cecil, well and good.<br> I'm thankful. Why not announce it?<br> - I promised. It's only for a few days.<br> - Victoria Station.<br> I couldn't help thinking<br> that our dear Lucy did not... No.<br> I wish you'd finish your sentences.<br> You're getting worse.<br> ...did not look like a bride-to-be.<br> How should one look? According<br> to your great experience in these matters.<br> I can't say exactly.<br> Only... she lacked something.<br> And, if you want to know,<br> Teresa, she lacked... radiance.<br> - Miss Bartlett.<br> - Mr. Beebe.<br> - What is happening to your neighbors?<br> - They're moving.<br> Old Mr. Emerson's rheumatism is back,<br> and George thinks it's too far.<br> Mr. Emerson is avoiding the removers inside.<br> Might I impose<br> and wait here for Mrs. Honeychurch?<br> By all means. I'm afraid you must excuse me.<br> Mr. Emerson, Miss Bartlett, excuse me.<br> Oh, please.<br> I am sorry that the house<br> has brought on your rheumatism.<br> It's not the rheumatism, it's my boy.<br> George is so sorry.<br> I cannot blame him,<br> but I wish he'd told me about it first.<br> - He never told you what happened in Italy?<br> - Not a word.<br> No. Lucy said he wouldn't.<br> I was only told last Sunday.<br> - What were you told?<br> - That he loves her.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> I think I hear the carriage.<br> It would be discourteous<br> to keep my cousin waiting.<br> There isn't any carriage.<br> Sit down, my dear.<br> Everyone's been lying, except George.<br> And now here's Miss Honeychurch<br> marrying Mr. Vyse in January...<br> She has broken off her engagement.<br> It was all done<br> with great tact and discretion, naturally.<br> And, for the time being,<br> we would like to keep it quiet.<br> There's a time for keeping quiet<br> and there's a time for speaking out.<br> Now, you don't hear any carriage.<br> Why don't you sit back,<br> make yourself more comfortable? Take this.<br> There. You look much better.<br> So... she's not marrying Mr. Vyse?<br> Why? Why Greece?<br> Why rush off to the ends of the earth?<br> You're tired of your home.<br> You're tired of Windy Corner.<br> And you're tired of Freddy and me.<br> Of course I'm not tired of Windy Corner,<br> but, as we're talking about it,<br> I shall want to come up to London more.<br> I might even share a flat<br> for a little with some other girl.<br> You see, I come into my money next year.<br> To mess about with typewriters<br> and latchkeys and call it work.<br> - Perhaps I spoke hastily.<br> - Oh, goodness!<br> You remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!<br> - Charlotte?!<br> - Charlotte to a T.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> We are not the least alike.<br> - You never used to be.<br> - Can't we have the hood down?<br> Can we have the hood down, Powell?<br> Powell, is that house to be let again?<br> Sir Harry's looking<br> for new tenants, I hear, Miss.<br> What a pity about the Emersons.<br> Freddy will be so sorry.<br> And, indeed, so am I.<br> - All right, Powell, stop at the stores.<br> - Yes, ma'am. Walk on.<br> Such an agreeable family.<br> What a pity.<br> No Charlotte.<br> Go and see if she's at Mr. Beebe's.<br> And do hurry, both of you.<br> Mary has her fish pie in.<br> Did you hear what I said, Lucy?<br> Lucy!<br> Mr. Emerson says it's all his fault.<br> I told him to trust to love.<br> I told him, "George, love and do<br> what you will." It's what I taught him.<br> So you see, it is all my fault.<br> Where are you going?<br> Your mother offered<br> to fetch me in her carriage.<br> I have not been brought up to keep<br> anyone waiting, least of all a kind hostess.<br> And now where's Lucy?<br> Get in. If Mary's fish pie spoils,<br> she'll mope till next Friday.<br> - I will sit here.<br> - Nonsense.<br> - I mustn't inconvenience you.<br> - You know you prefer facing.<br> I've no wish to even hear your son's name<br> mentioned. He has misbehaved from the first.<br> In fact, he behaved abominably.<br> Not abominably. He only tried<br> when he should not have tried.<br> No, of course,<br> abominable is too strong a word.<br> - It's no good discussing this.<br> - George is taking me to London.<br> He can't bear to be here,<br> and I must be where he is.<br> He says the thought of...<br> seeing you or hearing about you...<br> Mr. Emerson, please don't go on my account.<br> I'm going to Greece.<br> Don't leave your comfortable house.<br> You mustn't!<br> Why are you going to Greece?<br> Forgive me, but it seems to me<br> you're in a muddle.<br> I think the reason you're going to Greece<br> and you've broken off your engagement -<br> Miss Bartlett told me -<br> is that... you love George.<br> All the light's gone out of your pretty face.<br> Just like it's gone out of George.<br> I can't bear it,<br> and now I've made you cry. Forgive me.<br> But I've got to go to Greece now.<br> The ticket's bought and everything.<br> - It's impossible!<br> - There's only one thing impossible.<br> That's to love... and to part.<br> Lucy!<br> You love George.<br> You love the boy<br> body and soul, as he loves you.<br> But of course I do.<br> What did you all think?<br> - Then...<br> - No. Mother's calling. I've got to go.<br> They trust me.<br> Why should they?<br> When you deceived everyone...<br> ...including yourself.<br> Charlotte, sit here. Go on, Powell.<br> - One week Italy, then Greece.<br> - Greece may be cancelled.<br> - What?!<br> - Do stop!<br> - I think Lucy has something to tell us.<br> - Stop the horse!<br> Dear Charlotte, after an awful journey<br> when our luggage went missing twice,<br> we reached Florence.<br> You'll be glad to hear that<br> the Pensione Bertolini is its dear self.<br> The Cockney signora still terrorizes the staff.<br> Her guests are another set<br> of Miss Alans, Miss Lavish, Mr. Beebe<br> - and Charlotte and Lucy.<br> - We were promised rooms with a view.<br> Hush, we mustn't. First thing tomorrow,<br> I shall have a bone to pick with the signora.<br> It's so unfair!<br> Don't you agree that, on one's first visit to<br> Florence, one must have a room with a view?<br> We have a view.<br> Kiss me again.<br> - Again.<br> - I'm reading.<br> - What are you reading?<br> - It's from Freddy.<br> What does he say?<br> Silly boy, he thinks he's being dignified.<br> I mean, everybody knew<br> we were going away in the spring.<br>
