                        When I was still just a kid,<br> I remember my father telling me<br> what he thought that it took<br> for a man to be happy.<br> Tommy, finally! Come on, man,<br> New Year's is tonight.<br> - I'm sorry I'm late.<br> - Don't worry. I covered for you.<br> Thanks, Hank.<br> What, did you stay out<br> till they hung the last dog?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Ha!<br> Simple things, really...<br> A wife he loves,<br> a decent job,<br> friends and neighbors<br> who like and respect him.<br> And for a while there,<br> without hardly even realizing it,<br> I had all that.<br> I was a happy man.<br> Hey, Tom.<br> Remember we talked about<br> me getting off early today?<br> Hey, Hank!<br> Hey, Happy New Year, Schmitt!<br> - Hey, Linda, Happy New Year.<br> - Happy New Year.<br> - Hey, where you guys going?<br> - Sledding!<br> - Hey, can I come?<br> - No!<br> Ohh... Please! Ohh!<br> - Hey, Carl.<br> - Hey, happy new year, Hank.<br> You gotta start charging people for that.<br> Yeah, it'd pay better than the county does.<br> Honey, it's me.<br> - How you feelin' today?<br> - Hey. Good.<br> - Oh, my gosh.<br> - He was sure kickin' a lot today.<br> Uh-oh...<br> Looks like it's gonna be<br> a long afternoon for you.<br> He brought Lou along.<br> Oh, great.<br> Yeah. I'll just be lyin' here, relaxing.<br> Hey, Jacob!<br> What's he doing here?<br> He needed a ride home.<br> Little out of the way, isn't it?<br> We can drop him off when we're done,<br> you know. It's no big deal, Hank.<br> What's the big deal, Hank?<br> Hey, you know, you need to shovel this shit<br> off of your, uh...<br> whatcha-call-it deal there.<br> I'll pay you a quarter to do it.<br> Huh! I could use it.<br> Look at Lou.<br> Hey, baby.<br> Here, hold this, will you?<br> - Wanna put it back there?<br> - No, no, it's gonna wilt.<br> Hank, say hi to...<br> You didn't say hi to Mary Beth.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Hi, Mary Beth!<br> He said hi, Mary Beth.<br> Hank said hi.<br> Hi, Lou.<br> Come here.<br> Somebody else was here.<br> Oh, I brought those.<br> When?<br> Well... What the hell do you think, Hank?<br> This is the only day we can come here?<br> What the hell's wrong with you?<br> Hey, Jacob! Look!<br> I'm writing my name!<br> Hang on a second!<br> Let me get Mrs. Johnson out here!<br> I'll help you out.<br> You know what the guy says?<br> Says it's the crock pot<br> or, uh, crock box?<br> No, no. Pay attention now...<br> Oh, no, that's the preacher, see?<br> - This is the cowboy.<br> - Yeah, he says "moo."<br> No, no. It's the guy standing<br> by the road. He says:<br> "Why, officer? It's just a pine apple."<br> - You get it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, Mr. accountant doesn't get it.<br> Look out!<br> Shit!<br> You ok, baby?<br> Go on, get out!<br> Look at that, man!<br> My truck.<br> Come on, get out.<br> Mary Beth!<br> - She's gonna come back.<br> - Hey, what are you doing?<br> - It's a nature preserve, you know that.<br> - So what?<br> So you can't hunt here.<br> Come on, put the gun back.<br> But it... but it messed up my truck.<br> - So what? Come on.<br> - Hey, hey, Hank...<br> It's not like we're huntin' here.<br> - We're collectin' the dead.<br> - Come on.<br> We're collecting the dead.<br> - Just look at him...<br> - He runs like my wife.<br> Hey, come on, wait up!<br> Come on, I'm not dressed for this shit!<br> Mary Beth!<br> Jesus! Look at all them birds.<br> Those things are always waitin' on<br> something to die so they can eat it, right?<br> Weird.<br> What a weird job.<br> Wish we had something to drink.<br> Always be prepared.<br> Oh, that's a good idea.<br> Let's all start drinking now.<br> See there?<br> See how he is?<br> Wonk! Dit-dit...<br> Like that guy, you know?<br> - Remember? Wonk! Dit-dit.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - You want some?<br> - I'm not thirsty.<br> What, you don't drink till after 5:00?<br> After 5:00.<br> Or maybe you just don't wanna share.<br> You're afraid you'll catch<br> something from us, huh?<br> Yeah...<br> Hey, Hank!<br> Hey! Come on, what are you doing?<br> Quit jackin' around.<br> Now, you see...<br> That's what you might call<br> an "insinuating" throw.<br> Remember?<br> You said that to me last time I saw you.<br> Could've just said "hint".<br> But no, you had to put on airs.<br> Show us all them fancy words you know.<br> What, do you sit around,<br> you think about this stuff?<br> When was that, two months ago?<br> Kiss my ass.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> - Shit, that's a airplane.<br> You know what, it's probably<br> one of those drunk doctors.<br> They're always crashing<br> their plane, you know?<br> Yeah, it must've come down right there.<br> See all them broken trees, Jake?<br> It's too dark. I can't see.<br> Scrape some of that snow<br> off the windshield!<br> Can't see a damn thing.<br> Door's stuck.<br> Probably a singer or something.<br> Still can't see nothin' here.<br> Still can't see anything.<br> Can't see a damn thing.<br> I see the pilot!<br> - What's he talking about?<br> - Said somebody's in there.<br> Are you ok?<br> Hey, buddy.<br> Hey, get... get off!<br> Oh, God!<br> Shit!<br> Hey, lemme outta here.<br> - Good grief, Hank.<br> - Let me get this off of him. Here...<br> Hank, did you... did you...<br> Did you see all them birds?<br> Did I "see the birds"?!<br> Come on, help me get outta here.<br> - Hank, put that on your eye.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You tore your coat, you know.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> Oh, my God! Look at this!<br> Shit!<br> Oh, my God!<br> How much you think is in here?<br> God almighty! These are $100 bills!<br> The whole bag's full of 'em!<br> Is this... is it real money, Lou?<br> Oh, hell, yes, it's real.<br> Don't be stupid.<br> Why would somebody be flying<br> around with this kind of cash?<br> You know what?<br> - I bet it's drug money.<br> - That's probably what it is.<br> This guy's a dope dealer<br> because that's what they do.<br> They fly around in these little planes.<br> - I guaran-damn-tee you, this is dirty money.<br> - That's right. I saw it on 20/20.<br> "Dirty money"? What do you mean?<br> Are you telling me it's counterfeit?<br> Oh, no.<br> No, this is real.<br> Whatever it is, it's a police matter now.<br> What do you think we should do?<br> Somebody should stay here,<br> somebody should go after the cops?<br> - How you wanna work it?<br> - What? Let's think this through.<br> - What?<br> - Hold on!<br> What if we didn't turn it in?<br> You wanna keep it?<br> He wants to keep it...<br> Well, that's a hot one!<br> Why wouldn't we?<br> - Why wouldn't we?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Because we'd go to prison!<br> - Why?<br> Why? Because it's stealing.<br> "Stealing"...<br> Stealing from who?<br> From him? Hell, he won't mind!<br> Oh, 'cause he's dead, right?<br> That's pretty funny...<br> He's dead, he won't mind.<br> I say we take this bag back to the truck,<br> and we pretend like we were never here.<br> Fuck yeah. Why not?<br> Why not? Because we'd get caught.<br> Aw, hell! I'll tell you what.<br> Stay the hell out of it then.<br> You know, we don't need you.<br> It'd just be more money for us.<br> Hey, I don't wanna stump you<br> another fancy word, Lou,<br> but does the term "accomplice"<br> mean anything to you?<br> Come on, that's stupid!<br> But, Hank...<br> Why would we get caught?<br> Because it's a lot of money, Jacob.<br> Somebody's bound to be looking for it.<br> When they find that plane<br> and the money's not in it...<br> - Bullshit!<br> - No, it's not bullshit!<br> - They'll come looking for us.<br> - Bullshit! This is dirty money!<br> And as far as that guy's concerned,<br> the cops don't even know he exists.<br> Nobody knows about this...<br> ...but us.<br> See there?<br> Nobody knows but us.<br> It's like we came out here on a hike,<br> and found lost treasure, right?<br> It's the American dream<br> in a goddamn gym bag.<br> He... he just wants<br> to walk away from it.<br> You work for the American dream.<br> You don't steal it.<br> Then this is even better.<br> If this guy's a dope dealer, then,<br> like we're talkin' about...<br> then that means we're like Robin hood.<br> Oh, yeah, and I'll tell you what...<br> You got a beautiful wife at home.<br> You're about to have a baby.<br> I know you ain't pullin' down<br> that much at the feed mill.<br> Wouldn't you love to have a piece of this?<br> Hell, yes, I would.<br> But we can't just take it.<br> Hey, what if there's a reward?<br> Maybe there's a reward, and they'll give...<br> Maybe there's not!<br> How about this,<br> I tell you what,<br> I'll bet you $10,000,<br> just one of these packets,<br> that when they find this plane...<br> there's no mention of this money.<br> Hank, why... why turn it in until we know<br> whether or not somebody's lookin' for it?<br> That's right.<br> If you scratch, then don't... don't itch.<br> If you... if it's...<br> If it's broken, don't fix it.<br> Right?<br> Or if you... if... if...<br> if the... if... if... if...<br> And I know what you mean.<br> Suppose I was the one to keep it?<br> For how long?<br> Just till spring, till they find the plane.<br> Then what?<br> Then, if you're right and<br> nobody mentions the money,<br> we split it up, and we all leave town.<br> Why should you get to hold it?<br> That's the only way I'll do it.<br> Otherwise we can just turn it in right now.<br> You mean you don't trust us?<br> Is that what you mean?<br> That's a lot of money.<br> I guess I don't.<br> Look, no... no promises.<br> If somebody comes searching<br> for the money, I'll burn it.<br> - Hank...<br> - No, that's the only way I'll do this!<br> Look, we gotta be agreed on this.<br> That's the deal.<br> That's the deal.<br> I hold onto it,<br> we wait till they find the plane.<br> If nobody mentions it,<br> we split it up, and we move away.<br> OK?<br> I'm in.<br> We count it first.<br> That's probably a good idea.<br> I mean, you know...<br> This is... this is nuts!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Hey, what you gonna buy, Jakey boy?<br> I'm gonna buy me a truck.<br> No, fuck that!<br> Get something classy... Trans Am!<br> Oh, yeah, in my wildest<br> fuckin' dreams, a Trans Am.<br> - You could buy a fleet of Trans Ams!<br> - Mary Beth!<br> Where you been, huh?<br> $4,400,000!<br> Isn't that great?<br> Listen to that.<br> Look at that shit, man.<br> Look how square it is.<br> That is cool, huh?<br> How much is that apiece?<br> About a million and...<br> - A million and a half?<br> - Shh!<br> - Shh!<br> - What?<br> - You hear that?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> Oh, shit!<br> Get in the truck, I'll handle this.<br> Go on! Let's go!<br> Come on, cover up the money!<br> Jake, get in the truck!<br> Dummy up! Let's go!<br> Come on!<br> Hey, Carl.<br> - Engine trouble, Hank?<br> - Oh, I wish. Dog trouble.<br> Jacob's mutt chased a fox into the woods.<br> She tree it?<br> We thought so, but just when we went<br> after it, she came running back.<br> What'd you do to your head there?<br> Oh. God, uh...<br> Ran into a tree branch.<br> - Your brother still out of work?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Lou?<br> - Yeah, him, too.<br> That's a shame, ain't it?<br> Well, we probably better be heading back...<br> - Hey, hello, Jacob!<br> - Hey, Carl, how you doin'?<br> Good, good.<br> I was beginning to think<br> you were trying to avoid me.<br> I'm sorry?<br> Well, you sittin' over there in that truck.<br> I thought you was trying to avoid me.<br> No, I was just sittin' in the truck.<br> It's a little cold out here, you know.<br> Just keepin' warm.<br> Well, we probably better be...<br> Did you tell him about the plane?<br> - It sou-sounded like a plane.<br> - What plane?<br> What, you heard a plane?<br> I don't know what he heard.<br> You know he's always hearing shit.<br> Maybe you better tell me, Jacob.<br> No, that's OK.<br> We're gonna get on home.<br> - All right.<br> - All right.<br> Come on, man!<br> It's New Year's, let's get outta here!<br> Call me, Carl.<br> Happy New Year!<br> - Sure you don't need any help?<br> - No, we're all set. Thanks.<br> All right.<br> Goddamn it! I've seen you do<br> some pretty stupid things, Jacob.<br> But that pretty much takes the cake!<br> - It was my idea.<br> - Oh, well, that's brilliant, Lou.<br> Now when they find the plane,<br> and they realize the money's gone,<br> they'll know right off who took it.<br> Well, that's... that's what's<br> cool about it, though.<br> I mean, we wouldn't tell somebody<br> if we were the ones that did it.<br> It's not like he said that you actually<br> saw a plane going down.<br> Just you thought you might've<br> heard one with engine trouble.<br> You want me to burn the money?!<br> I am not going to prison over this!<br> If it looks like there's even the slightest<br> chance of us getting caught,<br> I swear to God, it's all gonna vanish!<br> You understand?<br> "It was a pine apple."<br> Oh, God...<br> This is gonna be fun.<br> Where the hell have you been?!<br> You always come when I'm finished.<br> I'm finished, you asshole!<br> Hey, Nancy!<br> Don't... Don't hit...<br> Don't hit Mary Beth.<br> Remember, nobody knows about this.<br> That includes Nancy.<br> She's gonna have to find out<br> about it sooner or later.<br> She's gonna wonder where all<br> the money's coming from.<br> - 2 hours late!<br> - Stop it!<br> Tell her when we decide<br> it's safe to keep it, but not before then.<br> Then the same goes for Sarah.<br> Of course.<br> Damn it!<br> Come on! You promised to shovel the walk,<br> you lazy son of a bitch!<br> Calm down, baby!<br> I got a good reason for being late.<br> What?<br> See you, Lou!<br> You know, I bet he's telling her.<br> That guy can't keep a secret.<br> - Hey, honey.<br> - Hey.<br> Where you been?<br> I was starting to get worried about you.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - Oh, that's all right.<br> Hey.<br> What happened to your head?<br> - It's OK. It's just a scratch.<br> - It's all bloody.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> What if you were walking in the woods...<br> It's not deep.<br> And you found a bag full of money,<br> let's say $4 million...<br> Would you keep it?<br> Of course not.<br> Here, hold that.<br> How come?<br> Well, for starters, it'd be stealing.<br> We were talking about lost money here,<br> nobody's looking for it.<br> - $4 million of lost money...<br> - Yeah.<br> - That nobody's looking for?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, so then whose money is it?<br> Yours.<br> It's my money?<br> But whose money was it before?<br> A bank robber's.<br> So then it's the bank's money.<br> All right, it's, uh, a drug dealer's.<br> Hank.<br> I mean, this is really silly.<br> Obviously you want me to say<br> something in particular.<br> I don't know what it is, but you<br> want me to agree with you or say<br> that you're right or something.<br> But I wouldn't take it.<br> That's just me. I wouldn't.<br> It's real.<br> If we keep it, we never have to<br> worry about money again.<br> But we don't have to worry<br> about money now, Hank.<br> You've got a good job.<br> We don't need it.<br> Yeah, but nobody gets<br> hurt by us keeping it.<br> I mean, that's what makes it a crime,<br> doesn't it? Somebody getting hurt?<br> What makes it a crime<br> is that it's against the law.<br> It doesn't matter if somebody<br> gets hurt or if they don't.<br> - If you get caught, then you go to jail.<br> - Nobody's gonna get caught.<br> The money's the only evidence<br> that we've done anything wrong.<br> We sit on it, we see what happens.<br> If somebody comes searching for it,<br> then we just burn it and that will be that.<br> There's no risk.<br> We'll always be in control.<br> What about Jacob and Lou?<br> As long as we're handling the money<br> they have to let us call the shots.<br> It seems... crazy just to give it up.<br> I mean, before we know if<br> anybody's searching for it.<br> This is it.<br> It ain't champagne, but...<br> Happy New Year!<br> You have to go back and<br> return some of the money.<br> What?<br> A lot. Like 500,000.<br> You see, that way when they find the plane<br> they'll assume nobody's been there yet.<br> It will put us beyond suspicion.<br> No one would walk away<br> from that much money.<br> Wait a second!<br> We're gonna keep the rest?<br> You'll have to go in the morning<br> so when it storms later,<br> it'll cover your tracks.<br> You can't tell Jacob though.<br> What, do you think<br> he'd go back and take it?<br> It's... it's just being careful.<br> That's what we have to be from now on.<br> We have to be careful.<br> We have to be thinking ahead all the time.<br> OK. OK.<br> OK.<br> Jacob!<br> Jacob, come on, open up!<br> Hey, I screwed up,<br> I moved the pilot.<br> Come on, we gotta go put<br> him back like he was.<br> Come on, I need a lookout.<br> If somebody comes by,<br> you pretend you're changing the tire.<br> You know, that's not gonna work.<br> What do you mean,<br> it's not gonna work?<br> Nobody's gonna believe that.<br> It's not flat.<br> You're kinda crafty.<br> I observe things.<br> Observe and learn, my friend.<br> Observe and learn.<br> That's cool.<br> Jacob, what happened,<br> she die on you?<br> No, we had a flat.<br> We had a flat tire.<br> I fixed it. See?<br> The new one's on there now.<br> I took the other one,<br> the bad one, and put it in the trunk.<br> It's back there now,<br> flat as a pancake.<br> But it's cool now.<br> Everything's all right.<br> You see that God damned fox<br> come by here about 5 minutes ago<br> heading right on down<br> to the woods?<br> No, I didn't see a fox.<br> I didn't see any fox.<br> Well, if you'd been standing where<br> I'm sitting he'd have bit you on the ass.<br> Why don't you stay here?<br> Hey, Hank!<br> Don't do anything stupid.<br> Jacob!<br> Oh, God.<br> Jesus, Jacob, what the fuck?!<br> I... I... I... I hit...<br> I hit the farmer.<br> - He was tracking a fox. I... I...<br> - Dwight!<br> He was gonna go right by the plane.<br> I had to do something.<br> I was just trying to help us out.<br> Just listen... listen to his...<br> to his heart or something like that.<br> Come on, man, listen.<br> You gotta do it... you...<br> He's... he's gonna be OK.<br> - Oh, God, Jacob, I think you killed him.<br> - I'm pretty sure he's gonna be OK.<br> What else was I gonna do?<br> Oh, God. He's dead.<br> Oh, Hank, that's not right.<br> No, we could probably...<br> We could probably do...<br> We can probably do that CPR deal.<br> And you know, you could do that, uh,<br> cardiac arrest thing, couldn't you?<br> We could do something,<br> goddamn it!<br> Jacob, what the hell you doing?<br> - Stop it!<br> - Come on!<br> I'm working CPR!<br> Goddamn it, stop it!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Be still. Let me think.<br> OK, we can't panic.<br> Have any cars gone by?<br> - Uh, cars?<br> - Cars, cars, come on, think.<br> While I was in the woods,<br> you see any cars go by?<br> Why, Hank?<br> Oh, God.<br> All right.<br> We gotta make this look<br> like it was an accident.<br> - Come on.<br> - An accident?<br> Grab his... grab his legs.<br> Wait, wait, wait.<br> We can't do that.<br> What do you mean we can't do it?<br> Because we're gonna make tracks and<br> they're gonna see them and follow 'em.<br> It's gonna be like a<br> crime scene or something.<br> We're gonna drive the car<br> back to the bridge.<br> I'll put him on the snowmobile<br> and take him through the park.<br> You gotta get there ahead of me.<br> So whatever you do,<br> I don't want you to stop.<br> I want you to just drive<br> on by then circle back.<br> I don't want people to<br> see you sitting there.<br> - Circle back?<br> - That's right. That's right.<br> Come on, come on now.<br> They're not gonna take me away, are they?<br> I mean, you gotta promise me...<br> Nobody's gonna take you away,<br> I promise. But we gotta hurry.<br> It's gonna be OK, right, Hank?<br> Come on, we gotta go.<br> - You gonna be there, right?<br> - I'm gonna be there. Now just go!<br> Go!<br> Dwight?<br> Dwight!<br> Your brother.<br> He hit me.<br> You call the police.<br> Get the police.<br> Jacob, what are you doing?<br> Come on, before anybody sees!<br> - I'm not gonna do this.<br> - What?<br> Well, it's just stupid.<br> I mean, if...<br> See, if we cover it up<br> it's just gonna be worse anyhow.<br> So, you know, I'm... I'm just...<br> Get in the car!<br> I'm just gonna go and pull him out, you know?<br> We're just gonna tell everybody the truth.<br> Just gonna tell 'em about the money<br> and everything and just say that I... that I...<br> - You're gonna leave tracks!<br> - Wait a minute.<br> This is my decision!<br> Mine!<br> Not yours!<br> You didn't kill him.<br> We both did.<br> What are you talking about, Hank?<br> He was alive when you left.<br> I smothered him.<br> I guess that makes it my decision.<br> It's gonna be OK.<br> I mean, it looked real.<br> And even if... I mean, let's say it didn't<br> look like an accident. Whatever. I mean...<br> Why would anyone think of us?<br> Your tracks lead right to the plane.<br> But it's gonna snow! Any minute now,<br> it's gonna start snowing.<br> Was there any blood?<br> Blood?<br> Jacob hit him.<br> Was there blood anywhere?<br> Did he get blood on anything?<br> Was there blood on the road or...<br> I don't remember.<br> - Did you look?<br> - I looked, but I... I just don't...<br> I mean, it was all hap...<br> Honey, it's gonna snow.<br> It's gonna snow<br> and everything's gonna be covered up.<br> - All the tracks...<br> - Shh.<br> He was apparently trying to cross<br> along this bank of snow.<br> When his snowmobile slipped over the edge<br> throwing him into the icy<br> waters of Anders creek.<br> Wright county deputies recovered the body<br> shortly before 4:00 this afternoon.<br> A tragic beginning to this new year<br> for one local family.<br> Back to you, Paul.<br> Thanks, Tracy.<br> I wish you hadn't told Jacob.<br> I wish he still thought that he did it.<br> Does it scare you?<br> Yeah, it scares me.<br> What if he tells somebody?<br> I mean, what I did.<br> What you did?<br> Well, I know that you only did it<br> because you felt trapped,<br> that you couldn't find any other way.<br> Would you have done the same thing?<br> I mean, if you'd been there instead of me?<br> I... I...<br> I just need to know if it's possible.<br> Oh, honey!<br> You listening to me, Hank?<br> Every Monday I come down here,<br> buy 2 bags of feed, regular as clock work.<br> That's 8 bags I'm supposed to be billed for.<br> - I don't know how else to get through to you.<br> - December started on a Monday, Mr. Schmitt.<br> So there were 5 mondays in the month.<br> So you came in here 5...<br> Are you telling me<br> there were 5 weeks last month?<br> No, sir, I'm telling you<br> there were 5 Mondays.<br> Excuse me.<br> I got it.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, Hank, it's me.<br> Hang on a second.<br> Listen, check that calendar over there<br> if you don't believe me, sir.<br> I need to talk to you.<br> Well, I'm a little busy right now, Jacob.<br> What is it?<br> OK, listen,<br> can you meet me at the farm?<br> - What farm?<br> - Our farm.<br> Look, uh, what is it?<br> On your lunch break.<br> Hey, are we straight on this, Mr. Schmitt?<br> Thanks for coming in.<br> Look, I can't drive out there right...<br> Jacob?<br> Jacob?<br> Hey, what are you doing here?<br> Look out!<br> What the hell'd you drag me out here for?<br> Listen to this. I'm gonna buy it back.<br> I'm gonna fix it up. I'm gonna rebuild it<br> just like it was before mom and dad died.<br> Come on, wait, wait.<br> We've been through all this.<br> We've been over this.<br> Once we split up the money,<br> we've gotta leave. We have to go.<br> What do you... what do you want me to do,<br> just like that, just drive off by myself?<br> Well, I mean, suppose you stay...<br> Where are you gonna tell<br> people you got the money?<br> Oh, that's easy.<br> We just tell people that Sarah<br> inherited some money. It's easy.<br> You know, nobody around here<br> knows anything about her family.<br> You guys could've just bought the farm,<br> you know, and then left me to run it.<br> - It's not gonna work.<br> - I thought this was gonna make you happy.<br> Jacob...<br> Farming? Come on.<br> You don't just buy a farm.<br> You gotta... you gotta work it.<br> You gotta know about machinery and seed.<br> - I know that.<br> - No, you don't.<br> Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides,<br> drainage, irrigation, the weather?<br> Come on, you don't know<br> about any of that stuff.<br> You're gonna end up just like dad!<br> Why do you think he ended up like that?<br> I'll tell you how he ended up like that.<br> He had 2 mortgages riding on the place.<br> He couldn't make the payments.<br> - Where do you think the money went?<br> - He was a bad businessman.<br> Where do you think the money went?<br> No, you think he spent it all on the farm?<br> I'll tell you exactly where the money went:<br> Yeah, or didn't you ever think<br> about how he paid for that?<br> - Didn't that ever occur to you?<br> - No, my tuition was...<br> Listen, I'm supposed to get the farm!<br> What do I get?!<br> I'm supposed to get the farm.<br> Jacob, you got... you got...<br> the whole world. You can...<br> I don't wanna hear that.<br> You can go anywhere you want.<br> This is what I want.<br> This is... this is where<br> I wanna be.<br> It's my home, Hank.<br> Shit.<br> - Hey, honey.<br> - What?<br> I wanna show you something.<br> - What is it?<br> - I got this...<br> I had it sent over<br> from the other branch.<br> Look, here it is.<br> "Heiress's body ID'd by feds."<br> "$4.4 million ransom."<br> You see?<br> This person nobody knows<br> has just disappeared right into thin air.<br> Do you recognize one of them<br> from the plane?<br> I can't tell.<br> His face was...<br> What?<br> This changes it.<br> Why is that?<br> We can't say it isn't stealing anymore.<br> Well, Hank, it's always been stealing.<br> We just didn't know who we were stealing from.<br> We thought it was drug money.<br> We thought it was money that we could find...<br> - No, you thought that. This is good. I'm glad...<br> - It's good?<br> Yes, it's good we know where it's from,<br> because I was starting to get worried.<br> I thought that it might<br> be counterfeit or marked.<br> - It might still be marked.<br> - No, it says right here.<br> Look: "demanded in unmarked bills".<br> Unmarked, you see?<br> You see?<br> You're just being paranoid, Hank.<br> It's over. It's good.<br> Sarah?<br> Would you come here, please?<br> Sure. OK, just a second.<br> I'll see you tonight.<br> Jesus!<br> Hey, come on, Hank!<br> Open up!<br> - What the hell are you doing?<br> - Hey, "Mr. Accountant"!<br> Well, I've come to make a tiny withdrawal.<br> Go home.<br> Turn around and go home right now.<br> - Oh, come on! It's freezing out here, Hank!<br> - Shh! Keep it down!<br> All right, just for a second.<br> I don't have time for this shit.<br> I gotta get up and go to work.<br> I want my share.<br> What?<br> I do. I want my share.<br> I don't have the money here,<br> and even if I did, I wouldn't give you any.<br> Oh, come on, now.<br> Look, just because you have it<br> doesn't mean it's yours.<br> Part of that is my money.<br> Part of it might be your money...<br> If we decide to keep it.<br> The plan was to sit on the money<br> till we decide that it's safe to keep it.<br> - Why are you coming over here with this shit?<br> - All right, look. I'll tell you what.<br> Just give me one packet, OK?<br> Just one packet.<br> And I'll come back later for the rest.<br> Ask me again, and I'll go<br> burn it tomorrow morning.<br> Is that clear?<br> It's a bluff.<br> What?<br> Yeah, it's a bluff!<br> B-L-U-F-F.<br> Oh, then why don't you call it then<br> and just see what happens?<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right. OK.<br> See, Jacob told me a little secret,<br> "Mr. Accountant".<br> I know what happened to Dwight Stephanson.<br> You drank too much.<br> I want one of those packets!<br> I told you, I don't have the money here.<br> I hid it away from the house.<br> Mm-hmm. Well, you know what?<br> It'd be a shame if somebody was to<br> drop a note to Carl Jenkins saying<br> there might just be a little something suspicious<br> about Dwight Stephanson's accident.<br> He just drove off that bridge?<br> Do you believe that? Do you?!<br> Come on. Jesus, Lou!<br> Remember, you're a thief, too.<br> We're all in this together.<br> If one of us goes to jail, we all do.<br> Oh, God.<br> I need my share, Hank.<br> I do.<br> I'm broke...<br> And I owe people money.<br> - Christ, Lou, I mean wh-wh...<br> - I need some help here, man.<br> OK, just wait here.<br> Here, here.<br> Shh! That's all I got.<br> Maybe I can go to the bank<br> and get you a loan out of our savings.<br> Look, look, look.<br> The money's a day's drive from here.<br> Even if I wanted go get it, I can't go get it,<br> not till Sarah has the baby.<br> A day's drive?!<br> Yeah, that's right. I put it in a storage locker<br> above the interstate.<br> - What the hell is it doing in a storage...<br> - Shh! It's safe. Don't worry, all right?<br> I didn't want it near us in case<br> we come under any suspicion.<br> - How the hell's that gonna happen?<br> - How's that gonna happen?<br> How about Carl knowing about<br> the plane, huh? Who's idea was that?<br> Yeah.<br> All right.<br> But we go get it as soon as she's done,<br> split it up right there...<br> Right?<br> Yeah.<br> Hank...<br> Skippy and Buddy...<br> Skippy and Buddy...<br> Hey, I said whoa.<br> I'm looking for Hank and Sarah.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, God, look at this.<br> Do you have a car seat in the car<br> you'll be traveling home in?<br> Is it currently installed?<br> Hello, look who's here!<br> Bearing tidings and gifts and great joy.<br> Would you sign here?<br> Sure.<br> What do you mean "gambling"?<br> Where?<br> At the casino. He lost some money.<br> How much?<br> - I don't know how much.<br> - Shh!<br> - Hey, congratulations!<br> - Thank you.<br> Congratulations.<br> Did you see that little baby?<br> It looked like a little tomato.<br> How could you have told him that, huh?<br> I put myself out for you.<br> What do you do, you betray me?<br> What are you talking about?<br> What am I talking about?<br> It's like there's two sides now.<br> Why are you both always talking<br> about sides? There's no sides.<br> Who's talking about sides?<br> I'm on both of your sides.<br> We're all in this together, man.<br> If you had to pick right now,<br> who'd it be?<br> No, I don't...<br> why would I wanna pick?<br> No, I wanna know...<br> Me or Lou?<br> Good grief, man. I...<br> I'd pick you.<br> You're my brother.<br> I bou...<br> I bought a present for the baby.<br> OK... OK, I... I brought it from the house.<br> I didn't buy it, but, look, it's...<br> It's kinda cool.<br> Just trust me on this one.<br> You're gonna like it, I think,<br> when you see what it is.<br> Thanks.<br> - God, it's used.<br> - Let me see that.<br> Oh, my gosh, this was his...<br> when we were kids.<br> Oh, I guess it's sweet<br> of him then, isn't it?<br> Buddy the bear.<br> Here's your little girl.<br> Oh, good, good, good.<br> Got her?<br> She's just about ready for her feeding.<br> Would you grab that thing?<br> Thank you so much.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello, little girl.<br> Hello.<br> She's hungry.<br> I want you to buy one of<br> those little tape recorders.<br> You know, the little dictating kind,<br> the kind you can hide in your pocket?<br> Why do you want a tape recorder?<br> You're gonna tape Lou<br> confessing to Stephanson's murder.<br> What?<br> What are you talking about?<br> You and Jacob invite him out for drinks.<br> Get him drunk.<br> You take him back to his place.<br> Then you start joking around,<br> kidding about confessing to the police.<br> Each of you takes a turn<br> pretending how you'd do it.<br> You go first,<br> Jacob second, and Lou last.<br> And when Lou goes, you tape him.<br> Come on, that's not gonna work.<br> Jacob helps you.<br> That's the key.<br> If Jacob eggs him on, he'll do it.<br> Yeah, but even if he,<br> you know, even if he talks on the tape,<br> it won't mean anything.<br> I mean, who's ever gonna believe it?<br> Well, it doesn't matter<br> as long as Lou believes it,<br> as long as he sees that<br> Jacob's taking your side.<br> That's all you want.<br> We should at least try,<br> shouldn't we?<br> We can't lose anything by trying...<br> Right?<br> Come on, it's not like<br> I'm asking you to do that much.<br> Here, just pick up the phone<br> and give him a call and say:<br> "Hey, Lou, Hank suggested we go out<br> drinking tomorrow night."<br> Hank suggested we go out drinking?<br> What are talking about?<br> - Will you let me finish?<br> - We suggest we go out drinking.<br> - You don't ever suggest we go out drinking.<br> - I'm getting to that. Let me finish.<br> I'm saying:<br> Tell him I've agreed to split up the money.<br> I thought it'd be a good idea for us to...<br> to go out and celebrate first.<br> So you want me to trick him?<br> You want me to trick Lou?<br> You want me to trick my friend?<br> OK.<br> Do you get what's happening here?<br> Do you understand the seriousness<br> of the situation we're in?<br> - He can put us both in jail, Jacob.<br> - He's not gonna send us to jail.<br> Well, I can't take that chance,<br> not now, not with the baby.<br> I can't afford to go to prison, Jacob.<br> I mean, wh-what about Sarah, huh?<br> Wh-what are they gonna do?<br> I'm gonna have to get rid of that<br> Christmas tree out of here.<br> It's too dry. It's gonna start a fire...<br> Would you pay attention here?<br> Pay attention!<br> - What would dad do?<br> - I'll think about it.<br> - What would dad want us to do?<br> - Don't do that, please, Hank.<br> Don't you think he'd<br> want us to stick together?<br> Don't say that. I mean, you don't<br> know what the hell dad would do.<br> That's fucked up.<br> Don't bring him up.<br> Well...<br> What if I was to say I'd help you<br> get the farm back, huh?<br> All right...<br> I'll help you buy back the farm.<br> But you got to help me first.<br> You know, all I meant by that<br> about the tree is it's just dried out.<br> And it could start a fucking fire.<br> You know how that stuff goes.<br> It wasn't like I was trying to ignore you<br> or something like that.<br> I was just, you know, I was talking about<br> practical shit to you is all it was.<br> Yeah, we got that white carpet.<br> - Honey?<br> - Oh. Oh, hey.<br> - Hey, Sarah.<br> - Hey, Jacob.<br> I take my shoes off for you there, see?<br> Thank you.<br> It's a nice shirt.<br> Ta-da!<br> Here, let me do that.<br> - Hey, I gotta pee.<br> - Yeah, go ahead.<br> - Hi, baby.<br> - Hey.<br> - You brought him here?<br> - Yeah. I invited him for dinner.<br> Oh! Good.<br> Good, good.<br> OK.<br> So he's gonna do it?<br> I had to promise him the farm.<br> You what?<br> Wait, I thought you said...<br> we agreed that you were<br> gonna say something.<br> Where's he supposed to go,<br> Sarah, huh? I mean...<br> What's he gonna do, drive away?<br> I don't know, honey. I don't know,<br> but if he stays, we get caught.<br> I know, I know. It's just...<br> It's just a matter of<br> time before he screws up.<br> I know. That's not what I'm saying.<br> I just...<br> I just wish he could, that's all.<br> No, no, you remember what she did?<br> She was so freaked out that she called<br> the volunteer fire department,<br> and then, remember,<br> they came out...<br> - Oh, yeah, there was all of dad's buddies...<br> - All his drinkin' buddies.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> That's... that's all the volunteer<br> fire department was,<br> was guys he knew, you know?<br> So they show up...<br> And he's sitting there in the kitchen<br> with that ice pack on his face.<br> That's ridiculous. He felt like an idiot,<br> 'cause they're all gathered in there<br> like there's some huge emergency<br> over there, you know?<br> Shh, shh.<br> OK.<br> Well, back on call.<br> Hey, how about some more wine?<br> You got a full glass here.<br> What's it like, a walkie-talkie, Sarah,<br> kind of like a baby walkie-talkie?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> It's kinda cool.<br> Remember, we had that thing we did<br> with them little walkie-talkies?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - You got that kit for Christmas.<br> Remember that?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, it's weird.<br> I think... I think about that stuff.<br> I think it's kinda weird...<br> You remember everything, too,<br> don't you?<br> Well, yeah. I was always...<br> I was always talking to dad.<br> I know you were.<br> I was always figuring out<br> what's going on, you know?<br> I was always nervous about<br> shit, you know, I guess.<br> But I tell you what, he's a...<br> If he... if he had the still<br> like we got goin' on right now, you know?<br> He would... he would...<br> he would have done the same thing.<br> I don't know, I don't know.<br> I guess so.<br> I mean, 'cause that's what he...<br> He always wanted to get<br> everything set up, you know what I mean.<br> He always wanted to have enough<br> to just take care of things and relax, you know.<br> Yeah.<br> He never quite had that,<br> so I think he'd done it.<br> But, uh, I tell you what, he'd still...<br> I guarantee you, if he'd had this,<br> he'd still be here.<br> He'd have never done that.<br> Done what?<br> Killed hisself, you know.<br> It just wouldn't have happened.<br> What?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Hank, dad killed himself,<br> you know that?<br> What?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Come on, what are you talking about?<br> They were drunk, they had a wreck.<br> That's out on Jack's spur road.<br> That's like that ramp is...<br> Where he went every day?<br> You ain't gonna roll away<br> on a ramp like that.<br> He'd be on that thing<br> You think all of a sudden<br> he forgot his way?<br> Good grief!<br> He figured that, you know,<br> all that insurance money, it'd be...<br> You know, it'd take care of the whole<br> deal that he wanted to... you know...<br> - What? No, no. What? Wait...<br> - You know that, Hank.<br> I mean, think about it.<br> I guess what I'm trying to say is,<br> well, maybe I misjudged you, Hank.<br> 'Cause, I mean, you're a bit more,<br> well, I don't know, let's... let's say...<br> serious... ha ha ha... than a guy like me.<br> And, you know, maybe sometimes...<br> you can come across like you<br> sort of got a stick up your ass.<br> I...

We shouldn't...<br> we shouldn't have done that.<br> We should have never let him keep that money.<br> Look how he's looking at us,<br> like he's fucking better.<br> Like... like... like<br> you own us or something.<br> I think we've all had too much to drink.<br> Let's call it a night.<br> You're gonna keep the money<br> and shit, you know.<br> Let's all go home.<br> That's what... that's what you<br> wanted, wasn't it, Hank?<br> You wanted me to pick sides,<br> isn't that what you said?<br> What are you talking about?<br> You know what...<br> You know what he's going to do?<br> He's gonna crawl into Carl's office<br> like, on his belly like a fucking snake.<br> He's gonna end up confessing.<br> You know what, you're right.<br> I bet you would rat on us just to<br> get off the hook, now, wouldn't ya?<br> Take... take me home, man.<br> Let's go.<br> I don't want to stay here.<br> I gotta get home.<br> No, huh,<br> you know what? Wait.<br> - Come on, take home.<br> - Uh, no!<br> We got... we got<br> something else for you, Hank.<br> I tell you what... Let's do this:<br> Let's do more playacting...<br> and let's do it where he...<br> where Hank confesses, OK?<br> ...to Carl, all right?<br> This is gonna be cool.<br> You be... and you be Hank<br> and I'll be Carl.<br> No, you do... you do it.<br> You go out and be Hank,<br> - like you'd knock on Carl's door.<br> - I can't do anything like him.<br> But when you're fucked up,<br> you're funny as shit.<br> - Come on, do it.<br> - OK.<br> And you're knocking on the door,<br> and I'm like sitting here doing paperwork<br> and dumb ass comes in, OK?<br> Dumb ass comes in<br> with his tail between his legs, OK?<br> OK, here, I'm coming in.<br> - You ready?<br> - OK.<br> Hello?<br> Carl...<br> It's Hank Mitchell.<br> - Well, hey, Hank, how you doing?<br> - Hey, how you doing?<br> Sit... sit down.<br> I need to talk to you.<br> Yeah, OK, what about?<br> It's about Dwight Stephanson.<br> Yeah?<br> He didn't die in an accident.<br> What are you talking about?<br> No, no, I killed him.<br> - You killed Dwight Stephanson?<br> - That's right.<br> I suffocated him with his own scarf,<br> and then I just shoved him<br> off the bridge into Anders creek.<br> I made it look like an accident.<br> Well, why would you do something like that?<br> That... that's OK...<br> a lot more to me than some old man's life.<br> - All right, that's enough.<br> - No, I'm up to the part<br> where you're gonna agree<br> to testify against us, OK?<br> Can I just do that? Come on...<br> I killed him.<br> - You killed Dwight Stephanson?<br> - That's right.<br> I suffocated him with his own scarf,<br> and then I just shoved him off<br> the bridge into Anders creek.<br> You taped this?<br> I made it look like an accident.<br> Well, why would you do that, Hank?<br> It's your confession.<br> It's you saying<br> how you killed Dwight Stephanson.<br> Nobody's going to believe that.<br> I mean... I mean, it's obvious I'm just<br> kidding around on there, isn't it, Jacob?<br> Why... why would anybody believe it?<br> I mean, let's just think about this.<br> If... if you and I both go into<br> Carl's office tomorrow afternoon<br> and we both claim the other one<br> killed Dwight Stephanson,<br> who... who do you think he's<br> gonna believe, huh? You?<br> A 40-year-old unemployed<br> high school dropout,<br> who's proud when people call<br> him the town drunk, or me?<br> I've got a job.<br> I don't get drunk<br> and... and... and...<br> and scream obscenities<br> at my wife in public.<br> I don't pass out on<br> other people's doorways.<br> I wonder who he's gonna believe?<br> Yeah.<br> Now we're all back in the same boat again.<br> Isn't that right, Jacob?<br> You seem to have forgotten<br> we're all in this together.<br> Yeah, yeah, it's...<br> that's all... that's all it is, Lou.<br> That's all it is, just a little insurance policy.<br> You know, it's not to hurt you.<br> That... that's what Hank said.<br> - It's just so you don't hurt him.<br> - That's right.<br> And... and... and<br> it's like...<br> It's just in case you confess or...<br> Wait a minute.<br> Are you... are you telling me<br> you knew about this, Jacob?<br> Take it easy.<br> - You saying you knew about this?<br> - He isn't going to use it, unless, uh...<br> Is that what...<br> Is that what you're saying here, Jacob?<br> That... that... that<br> you two worked together?<br> I... he said he'd help me<br> buy back the farm, Lou.<br> Oh!<br> Oh!<br> So that's cool, right?<br> - Hey, Lou, please don't be pissed off.<br> - Come on, let's go.<br> You know, he was...<br> We were just gonna...<br> He'll cool down, Hank.<br> Move, move, move!<br> Let's go.<br> Don't move!<br> - What the hell are you doing?<br> - You give me that tape!<br> Goddamn, put down the gun!<br> No! No, you're not leaving here<br> until I get that fucking tape!<br> OK, just settle down.<br> - Hey, Lou, leave him alone.<br> - Or what?<br> What, are you gonna shoot me,<br> Jake, huh?<br> Just leave...<br> just leave him alone.<br> No, you stabbed me in the back,<br> right here in my own house!<br> Lou?<br> What's going on?<br> Come on, Lou, please!<br> You know I need that money.<br> Please, Lou, leave him alone.<br> No, let me do it!<br> I need it tomorrow.<br> You know, they're gonna...<br> They're gonna take my truck.<br> Put the gun...<br> put the gun down, Lou!<br> You see he's got a job.<br> It's you and me, buddy.<br> We're the ones...<br> We're the ones who needs it.<br> - He just wants it!<br> - OK, OK.<br> - Come on, Lou, put it down.<br> - No!<br> - Put the gun down.<br> - No, shut up!<br> Please, Lou, come on, man,<br> Lou, please, don't do that.<br> Do you think he's your friend, huh?<br> Lou, put it down!<br> He doesn't give a fuck about you, do ya?<br> Come on, Lou, let's all settle down.<br> We'll talk it through.<br> Jesus!<br> That was an "insinuation".<br> Lou, for God's sakes.<br> Put the gun down, baby!<br> Lou!<br> This...<br> This is the real thing.<br> Lou, no!<br> No, Lou, don't it!<br> Put it down!<br> Oh, God!<br> Oh, my baby!<br> Oh, my baby!<br> Oh, my baby!<br> Hank, please stay<br> out here and talk to me.<br> Don't... don't...<br> Tell me what's going on, Hank?<br> It's OK, Nancy.<br> Call 911! Call the cops!<br> I'll call 911, but we got to decide...<br> We got to decide what we're gonna say.<br> You saw what happened.<br> It was an accident.<br> - You killed him.<br> - He got drunk, he went crazy.<br> - You killed him for the money!<br> - You can have his share.<br> You can have it.<br> You fucking think I like him<br> just for money?!<br> - You stay out!<br> - Settle down.<br> Stop it!<br> What are you doing?<br> Stop it!<br> Take it easy, Nancy.<br> Oh, my God!<br> No. No,<br> I wasn't going to...<br> No, no, no, no, I'm not<br> gonna... I wasn't gonna... no...<br> You saw what happened.<br> It was self-defense.<br> No, wait!<br> Let's just talk, ok?<br> Figure this out?<br> Come on, we gotta, OK?<br> No!<br> Hank.<br> Hello, yes. There...<br> There's been a shooting.<br> H-Hank Mitchell.<br> I'm at Lou Chambers' place,<br> County Road 27,<br> just past the burnt road.<br> They're both...<br> They're both dead!<br> Oh, God, please hurry!<br> Jacob?<br> Jacob?<br> Hey, what are you doing?<br> Huh?<br> What, are you going to be OK?<br> Come on, we can make this work.<br> We don't have much time.<br> Now, listen to what I have to say<br> very carefully, OK?<br> They were fighting, OK?<br> They were both drunk.<br> And Lou started pushing Nancy around.<br> When we tried to stop him, he got really<br> pissed off and he grabbed his shotgun.<br> And she ran in the kitchen<br> and got her pistol.<br> You ran out to your truck<br> and got your rifle,<br> but by the time we got back to the house,<br> it was too late. He'd already shot her.<br> He was shooting up the whole place.<br> The ceilings, the walls, everything.<br> When we stepped in the doorway,<br> he shot at me, but he missed.<br> So he aimed the shotgun at my chest,<br> and just before he pulled the trigger...<br> you killed him.<br> You saved my life.<br> See?<br> It was self-defense.<br> Come on, Jacob.<br> I need to hear you say it.<br> They were fighting.<br> Lou got really mad.<br> He shot the walls, he shot the ceiling.<br> Then what did we do?<br> We ran out to the truck.<br> You ran outside with Jacob,<br> 'cause, uh...<br> Jacob said, uh... he ran out to get<br> his rifle on his own. He said, uh...<br> See, he said, uh...<br> "Lou ran you out of the house<br> after he shot Nancy."<br> Jacob said that?<br> Huh...<br> Well, I suppose...<br> I can see how it might've seemed<br> that way to him.<br> Because...<br> he did... he did go out<br> to the truck alone.<br> I followed him, but...<br> then, when I heard the shot...<br> and Nancy got killed...<br> I turned back toward the house...<br> I was on the porch<br> wh-when Lou started outside...<br> And that's when I turned<br> to run out into the yard.<br> So...<br> I guess...<br> I... I can see how it might've seemed that<br> way to Jacob, that I was running outside.<br> Yeah.<br> Go home, Hank. We'll, uh...<br> I think we got what we need for right now.<br> - "May they rest in peace."<br> - May they rest in peace.<br> "And may their souls<br> and the souls of all the faithful departed"<br> through the mercy of God,<br> rest in peace."<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> In the name of the father,<br> the son, and the holy spirit...<br> Hey.<br> Oh, I think the little<br> lady's ready to come out.<br> Maybe she's getting a little cold.<br> Shh...<br> - Who could that be?<br> - I don't know.<br> It's Carl.<br> Hey, Carl.<br> I hope I didn't wake you, Hank.<br> I saw a light was still on.<br> Oh, no, no. Just, you know,<br> getting ready for bed.<br> I hate like hell<br> to have to do this to you, Hank.<br> I was, uh... driving out by<br> Lou Chambers' place, and, uh...<br> I saw your brother's truck parked<br> out in the middle of the road.<br> I could barely squeeze around it.<br> I found him inside the house<br> passed out in an armchair.<br> Well, I appreciate you bringing him here.<br> I... I mean, I hope<br> it wasn't too much...<br> I know you guys had a real rough time.<br> Just... have a talk with him, ok?<br> And I'll try to keep an eye on him, too.<br> Come on, what the hell<br> were you thinking about, huh?<br> That's the last place in the world<br> you oughta be.<br> God, I just about had a heart attack<br> when Carl knocked on the door.<br> We gotta be careful.<br> Can't take any chances.<br> Get yourself over.<br> There we go.<br> Comfortable?<br> Only I don't think I should be here<br> in the baby's room. It's... it's clean in here.<br> What? It's OK.<br> The baby sleeps with us.<br> Hey, you remember this?<br> Everything goes to sleep.<br> Your head goes to sleep.<br> Remember when dad used to do that?<br> Your head goes to sleep.<br> Your shoulders go to sleep.<br> Your arms go to sleep.<br> Your back goes to sleep.<br> Hank, do you ever feel evil?<br> I do.<br> I feel evil.<br> You know, maybe I can get<br> a family of my own now.<br> I mean, with the money and all.<br> Why? Don't you think somebody<br> would marry me if I'm rich?<br> You don't need money for that.<br> Hank.<br> Hey, come on.<br> What about... What was her name?<br> Carrie Richards?<br> She liked you even though<br> you were broke-dick.<br> Oh, her. Yeah.<br> That was a whole different deal.<br> That was...<br> Her... her friends, they pitched in<br> and betted her that she wouldn't<br> go steady with me for a month.<br> Jesus, Jacob.<br> I thought you guys had a thing.<br> I don't know. It...<br> It weren't that bad.<br> I mean, actually,<br> it was kind of cool.<br> We used to walk around<br> together a lot, you know.<br> Take walks, you know?<br> And, uh...<br> we talked about<br> all kinda cool stuff.<br> I held hands with her one time.<br> We were walking around,<br> but my hand sweated so much<br> she kinda had to let it go.<br> I was nervous, I guess.<br> But it was cool.<br> When the month was over, she, uh...<br> you know,<br> kinda would say hi to me sometimes<br> in the hallway when I'd see her.<br> She didn't have to do that.<br> That was cool of her.<br> God, Hank, you know, I've never...<br> I've never even kissed a girl before.<br> And you know what?<br> If being rich will change that,<br> I'm all for it.<br> I don't care.<br> I just wanna feel it, you know?<br> I just wanna know what people do, you know?<br> I don't care if it's 'cause of the money.<br> Hank?<br> I'm gonna be happy now, right?<br> Sure you are.<br> We all are.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> We all are.<br> You know what?<br> I'm gonna, you know,<br> buy back the farm, you know?<br> And have, uh...<br> And have a lot of kids,<br> 'cause I'll meet this nice girl<br> and she'll be really cool to me<br> and be really nice.<br> Just normal,<br> a normal woman, you know.<br> And, uh...<br> And then you and Sarah<br> will come over and bring Amanda,<br> and we'll all sit around<br> and tell stories and stuff.<br> We'll drink on the porch<br> like dad and Uncle Ted used to do.<br> - You know?<br> - Yeah.<br> He nod off on you, Jack?<br> Hey, Carl.<br> Gettin' a bit thin<br> up top there, Hank.<br> Don't you have any crimes to solve?<br> Maybe.<br> Think you could track down Jacob,<br> bring him by my office tomorrow afternoon?<br> Sure. What for?<br> Man from the FBI's gonna be driving through.<br> Thought you two might<br> be able to help him out.<br> - Seems they're looking for a lost plane.<br> - Huh.<br> - See ya about 3:00.<br> - You bet.<br> Maybe we should just leave.<br> Take the money and the baby<br> and just leave the country.<br> Stop it, Hank!<br> You'll go in there<br> and you'll see what he knows.<br> If anything looks bad,<br> we can always move the money.<br> - It's still the only thing tying us to anything.<br> - The connections are just under the surface!<br> Sarah, I mean, think about it.<br> It wouldn't be that hard<br> for somebody to just put it all together.<br> There's the plane and...<br> and Stephanson.<br> There's Lou and Nancy.<br> You've gotta remember how people see you.<br> You're just a normal guy,<br> a nice, sweet, normal guy.<br> - They're gonna know!<br> - No, they won't!<br> Nobody would ever believe that you'd<br> be capable of doing what you've done.<br> Well, it was snowin' pretty hard,<br> so we're not really sure,<br> but it sounded kinda like<br> an engine cuttin' on and off.<br> But that was it.<br> We didn't hear anything more.<br> No... No crash.<br> No engine. Nothing.<br> Anything you want to add to that, Jacob?<br> No.<br> I can't think of anything.<br> That's about it.<br> It was probably a snowmobile or something.<br> You know?<br> Well, guess that's it, guys.<br> - Thanks for comin'.<br> - My pleasure, Carl.<br> Good to see you, Carl.<br> - Nice to have met you.<br> - I'll talk to you later.<br> Do you think you could<br> take us out there?<br> To the nature preserve?<br> Have to go in the morning, I guess,<br> after the storm passes.<br> C-can you tell us what<br> this is all about?<br> Lookin' for a plane.<br> There's no way<br> it's from the armored car robbery.<br> This isn't a guess, honey.<br> The guy from the FBI told me.<br> It doesn't make sense.<br> The kidnapping made sense.<br> He's looking for a plane full of money.<br> I mean, how many of those<br> can there be around here?<br> It was hundred-dollar bills, Hank.<br> If it was an armored car robbery,<br> there'd be other denominations.<br> There'd be 50s and 20s and 10s.<br> Well, congratulations, Sarah.<br> I guess you know more than the FBI.<br> Hank?<br> Did he show you his badge?<br> Why would he show me his badge?<br> Wait.<br> It's him, isn't it?<br> It's the older one... Vernon.<br> He's looking for his brother.<br> The guy I met today was skinnier.<br> He didn't have a beard.<br> Well, maybe he lost weight.<br> Maybe he shaved.<br> Well, that doesn't make<br> a difference, does it?<br> I mean, no matter who he is,<br> I still have to take him to the plane.<br> Well, if we think it's him,<br> you shouldn't go.<br> Why not?<br> Because he's gonna shoot all 3 of you, Hank.<br> As soon as he sees the plane.<br> That's why he wants you to go,<br> so he can get rid of the witnesses.<br> But if he's really from the FBI,<br> and I don't show up,<br> it's gonna look suspicious as hell.<br> I'll call the FBI in the morning.<br> I'll ask for an agent Baxter.<br> That won't work. I'm meeting him at 9:00.<br> They won't be open before that.<br> You can stall them for a bit.<br> And, uh, I'll call from here,<br> and then I'll call you at Carl's office.<br> And what if there's no agent Baxter,<br> then what?<br> Well, then you won't go.<br> You can tell Carl that the baby's sick,<br> and... and that you have to come home.<br> What about Jacob?<br> Say he's hung over.<br> Carl would believe that.<br> Whoever the guy is,<br> you don't want Jacob there.<br> It sounds like a B.S. excuse.<br> - Hank, what do you want?<br> - Well...<br> Do you want to just walk out there<br> and get shot by this guy?<br> No, I don't wanna walk out<br> there and get shot!<br> - Well, I'm trying to come up with a plan.<br> - A plan?<br> Yeah.<br> Like the one to take the money back to<br> the plane, and we end up killing Stephanson?<br> Or maybe the one where we tape Lou,<br> and 2 more people end up dead.<br> Is that the sort of plan<br> you're thinking of?<br> Well, I've got a plan!<br> I'm taking the money back right now.<br> All of it.<br> - Hank.<br> - No!<br> Hank!<br> I'm gonna put it back, and everything's<br> gonna be just like it used to be.<br> That money, goddamn it!<br> Fuckin' money!<br> Is that what you think?<br> Is that what you think you want?<br> Walking off to the feed store<br> every morning for the next 30 years,<br> waiting for Tom Butler to retire or die<br> so you can finally get a raise?<br> And what about Amanda?<br> Do you think she's gonna like growing up<br> in somebody else's hand-me-down clothes?<br> Playing with some kid's old toys<br> because we can never afford<br> to buy her anything new?<br> Don't say any more.<br> And me...<br> What about me?<br> Spending the rest of my life, 8 hours a day,<br> with a fake smile plastered on my face<br> checking out books.<br> And then coming home<br> to cook dinner for you.<br> The same meals over and over again,<br> whatever the week's coupons will allow.<br> Only going out to restaurants<br> for special occasions,<br> birthdays or anniversaries. And even<br> then having to watch what we order...<br> Skipping the appetizer,<br> coming home for dessert.<br> You think that's gonna make me happy?<br> - That's enough.<br> - No, no. I haven't done Jacob yet.<br> It's back to the welfare office for Jacob.<br> The occasional odd job.<br> But with Lou gone now...<br> Just himself and his dog<br> all alone in that filthy apartment.<br> How long do you give him, Hank?<br> Stop it!<br> Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?<br> Everything just like it used to be.<br> Federal bureau of investigation.<br> I would like to speak to...<br> Is there an agent Neil Baxter there?<br> Well, if Jacob can't make it,<br> that just leaves more of Linda's<br> homemade breakfast treats to go around.<br> Hank, go ahead.<br> Have one of those.<br> Help yourself.<br> That's her own special creation there.<br> Deep-fried dietetic donuts.<br> And so inedible, you won't be able<br> to get enough of it down to be bad for you.<br> Hey, this guy, uh...<br> You know, this guy Baxter,<br> he showed you his badge or anything?<br> Badge?<br> Yeah. This is kinda stupid, but,<br> you know, I always wondered<br> if they look like they do in the movies.<br> Yeah? How's that?<br> Well, you know,<br> kinda bright and silver<br> with a big "FBI" stamped across the center.<br> Not really.<br> He showed you his?<br> Well, no,<br> but I've seen them before.<br> I wonder where he is.<br> Well, you know, I bet he'd show it to you<br> if you just ask him that.<br> Hell,..<br> he might even let you hold his gun<br> if you ask him real nice.<br> You know what, later on,<br> I could take you for a ride in my truck<br> and make the lights flash for you.<br> Yeah?<br> - Carl?<br> - Yes.<br> It's Sarah. Hi.<br> I'm looking for Hank. Is he there?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> You found him.<br> He's standing right here.<br> He's trying to avoid eating<br> one of my wife's homemade donuts.<br> How's the baby?<br> She's not doing so good. That's part<br> of what I'm calling to tell him about.<br> I'm sorry to hear...<br> Well, you probably better<br> tell him that yourself, OK?<br> All right. You take care.<br> That's your wife.<br> Hi, honey.<br> - It's him.<br> - What?<br> It's him, Hank.<br> Come home.<br> You gotta get out of there.<br> Hank?<br> I gotta stay.<br> What do you mean you gotta stay?<br> We agreed that if I called you,<br> that you were gonna come home.<br> What about Carl?<br> I don't know. Tell Carl...<br> Tell him to give the guy the directions<br> and that you two will meet him there later...<br> Everybody ready to roll?<br> Hank, he's gonna...<br> He's gonna shoot you both.<br> Ready to roll.<br> Hank?<br> Yeah.<br> Hank?<br> Huh.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, they're waiting<br> for me, baby. I gotta go.<br> - Carl, how you doin'?<br> - Good morning. How'd you sleep?<br> Hank?<br> You come home, OK? Please, baby.<br> Sarah.<br> OK.<br> Wait, Hank!<br> Yeah, I'll see you then.<br> Hank!<br> Ok. Yeah.<br> Yeah, I'll see you then.<br> God damn it! Don't!<br> I love you, too.<br> Wait! Hank?<br> Everything OK?<br> Oh, yeah. You know, just, uh...<br> some confusion about this evening's plans.<br> Where's your brother?<br> Oh, uh, Jacob won't be<br> joining us this morning.<br> It seems he tied one on<br> again last night.<br> - Ready when you are, Hank.<br> - Good. Let's go.<br> Oh, no.<br> You should've asked me.<br> Oh, hey.<br> I forgot my hat.<br> I'll catch up with you guys.<br> Well, go get it.<br> It's cold out there.<br> You saw that truck<br> right around the corner, didn't you?<br> Shit.<br> Oh, this is the place, Hank.<br> I'm pretty sure of it.<br> Look. Right there<br> is that, uh, nature preserve sign.<br> That's where you guys were.<br> I guess you're right, but I thought<br> it was a little further down,<br> just, you know...<br> And, you know, if it was off over on<br> that side, that's farmland over there.<br> Those farmers probably<br> would have found it by now.<br> The best bet's gotta be over<br> here in the nature preserve.<br> So I think the best idea is each of us take<br> a different section of the woods...<br> Oh, good for Jacob.<br> This will make things go faster.<br> Bring your rifle!<br> We'll take a different section of the woods.<br> If you or I find it, Baxter, we'll just<br> fire a couple of shots into the air.<br> And, uh, Hank, here, you take that whistle.<br> And if you find it,<br> just blow it loud as you can.<br> We'll all come running.<br> I thought you weren't up for this.<br> I talked to Sarah.<br> Well, I got up, and I felt better.<br> You're right. You don't look good.<br> Something wrong?<br> Oh, I just...<br> I had a rough night.<br> Well, let's go, guys.<br> - I'll take the center.<br> - All right.<br> Hey! Hey!<br> Carl...<br> Wait, Carl!<br> Get outta there!<br> Run!<br> Hey! Hey! I found it.<br> It's right down here.<br> Pull your gun on him!<br> Make him show you his badge!<br> - What?<br> - He's got a gun!<br> He's got a gun!<br> He's not FBI! He's lying!<br> What are you talking about?<br> Just do it!<br> I guess you might as well<br> just show him your badge.<br> All right, all right.<br> It's OK, Hank.<br> He's gonna show you his badge.<br> Don't turn your back!<br> Where's my money?<br> Where is it?<br> It's in the plane.<br> Then go get it.<br> Come on!<br> You waiting for something, genius?<br> Do it!<br> OK, OK.<br> Come on! Today!<br> OK, I've got it!<br> Where the fuck is the rest...<br> So you had a piece, huh?<br> But you're not the cold-blooded type,<br> are you, Mr. Mitchell?<br> Looks like we're both gonna have<br> an awful lot of explaining to do.<br> Just me.<br> Jacob?<br> Hank?<br> It's ok.<br> Don't.<br> Don't, don't.<br> Maybe...<br> - You're gonna mess it up.<br> - Mess it... mess it up?<br> Just leave him be.<br> OK.<br> You understand what we gotta say?<br> Huh?<br> We're gonna tell them that Carl lent me<br> the gun to signal if I found the plane.<br> Then when I saw Baxter shoot him...<br> We can't do this, Hank.<br> What do you mean we can't?<br> We're gonna have to tell on ourselves.<br> No, we don't.<br> We... we can't.<br> No. No.<br> - No. This is gonna work.<br> - Not anymore.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, it's gonna work.<br> It's perfect.<br> Come on, Jacob.<br> We just gotta get through the next<br> couple of hours, and then we're home.<br> We're home-free.<br> You wanna be happy?<br> You want a wife and kids?<br> Me and you sitting around on<br> the porch drinking late at night?<br> Well, God damn it,<br> this is what it costs...<br> Right here, right now.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Let's go over this again,<br> make sure we haven't overlooked anything.<br> I wish somebody else had found that money.<br> Well, they didn't. Now quit.<br> OK.<br> Baxter came down here.<br> He came up behind Carl.<br> I was over there.<br> Yeah, and you were in the woods.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> It's gonna work.<br> It's gonna work. Yeah.<br> W-what are you doing?<br> Now put this back.<br> Make it look like<br> the bad guy did it, Hank.<br> What?<br> Come on, we're almost home.<br> I'm tired, Hank.<br> A-a-and I don't care. It's ok with me.<br> I'm not... I'm not afraid.<br> No, Jacob.<br> - I'm not afraid. It's perfect.<br> - Stop that, Jacob.<br> - It's... it's perfect.<br> - No. No.<br> Come on, Hank.<br> Let me do something.<br> This is...<br> This is the only thing.<br> See, I don't wanna sit around<br> the rest of my life<br> thinking about this shit.<br> I can't do it...<br> Sit on the porch and drink.<br> I can't do it.<br> So you're gonna have to do it.<br> Couple more hours,<br> we'll be home.<br> You can do this,<br> and it's gonna be perfect for you.<br> You got something to go on for, Hank,<br> and you know it.<br> I don't wanna be here.<br> No. Please, no.<br> Come on, Hank.<br> Let me do something.<br> You just tell the little girl that I...<br> that, you know, that bear is from me.<br> You know?<br> If you love me, Hank,<br> you'll do it.<br> I'll give you a chance.<br> I won't look at you.<br> I won't look at you, Hank,<br> but if you don't do it...<br> then I'm gonna do it,<br> and then we're gonna both<br> gonna be fucked, aren't we?<br> We don't need to both be fucked.<br> - I'll... I'll do it, Hank, if you don't.<br> - No!<br> I'm telling you I will.<br> Boy, it's... it's funny about f-finding<br> this fucking plane, wasn't it?<br> Jacob!<br> Oh, Jacob!<br> To someone who's been properly trained,<br> there are many ways to detect a liar.<br> The shifty eyes of detective novels<br> have a certain basis in fact.<br> A wooden or stilted tone.<br> Gestures that seem either slightly robotic<br> or else unnecessarily expansive.<br> Details tend to be vague, slippery.<br> Sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth<br> with his hand when he speaks.<br> Did you notice anything like that<br> in the guy you shot today?<br> He was lying to you, Mr. Mitchell.<br> He wasn't from the FBI.<br> His name was Vernon Bokovsky.<br> His brother was in that crashed plane<br> you found out there today.<br> Bokovski and his brother were the guys who<br> kidnapped that McMartin girl last November.<br> Remember the one they shot<br> and dumped in the lake?<br> Want to touch it?<br> Go ahead.<br> Go ahead.<br> Pretty hefty, huh?<br> That's only part of it.<br> We're still tracking down the rest.<br> Yeah. It's just a matter of time.<br> A matter of time?<br> Well... we had the money for 2 hours<br> before the kidnappers picked it up.<br> Couldn't mark it. We were afraid they'd<br> detect the markings and kill the girl, so, um...<br> We put together a task force of 20 agents,<br> and they wrote down as many of<br> the serial numbers as they could.<br> We managed to record<br> just under 5.000 of them.<br> That's 1 out of 10 of the bills.<br> Now it's simply a matter of waiting<br> for the numbers to turn up.<br> Can't go around passing $100 bills without<br> eventually sticking in someone's memory.<br> No. No!<br> No, Hank. Hank!<br> Oh, Hank!<br> Hank, we can run with it.<br> We could leave the country.<br> We could go to South America<br> or to Australia or someplace far away.<br> Please, Hank!<br> There are days when I manage<br> not to think of anything at all...<br> Not the money...<br> Or the murders...<br> Or Jacob...<br> Days when Sarah and I try to pretend<br> that we're just like everyone else...<br> As if none of it had ever happened.<br> But those days are few and far between.<br>
