                        Waking up begins with saying<br> ''am'' and ''now''.<br> Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.<br> For the past eight months waking<br> up has actually hurt.<br> The cold realization that<br> I'm still here slowly sets in.<br> I was never teribly fond of waking up.<br> I was never one to jump out of bed and<br> greet the day with a smile like Jim was.<br> I used to want to punch him sometimes<br> in the morning he was so happy.<br> I always used to tell him that only fools<br> greet the day with a smile...<br> ...that only fools possibly<br> escape the simple truth.<br> That now isn't simply now.<br> It's a cold reminder.<br> One day later than yesterday.<br> One year later than last year.<br> And that sooner or later it will come.<br> He used to laugh at me and then<br> give me kiss on the cheek.<br> It takes time in the morning<br> for me to become George.<br> The time to adjust to what is expected<br> of George and how he is to behave.<br> By the time I have dressed and<br> put the final layer of polish...<br> ...on the now slightly stiff<br> but quite perfect George...<br> ...I know fully what part<br> I'm supposed to play<br> Looking in the mirror staring back at me<br> isn't so much as a face...<br> ...as the expression of a predicament.<br> Just get through the goddamn day.<br> A bit melodramatic, I guess.<br> But then again...<br> ...my heart has been broken.<br> I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...<br> ...can't breathe.<br> Aren't you going to say something?<br> Are you kidding? It's spectacular.<br> What are you doing?<br> Just stop it.<br> Stop it.<br> I don't think that you're quite<br> ready for life in a glass house.<br> Drapes, old man.<br> You're the one who is always saying<br> that we are invisible.<br> That's not exactly what I meant.<br> For the first time in my life<br> I can't see my future.<br> Every day goes by in a haze.<br> But today I have decided<br> will be different.<br> Finally. You know it's been<br> raining here all day.<br> I've been trapped in this house<br> waiting for you to call.<br> I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.<br> I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.<br> I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.<br> Yes sir, you have indeed called the...<br> ...correct number. How may I help you?<br> - This is Harold Ackerley.<br> I'm Jim's cousin.<br> Of course.<br> Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.<br> I'm afraid I'm calling with<br> some bad news.<br> There has been a car accident.<br> An accident?<br> There has been a lot of snow here<br> lately and the roads have been icy.<br> On his way into town,<br> Jim lost control of his car.<br> It was instantaneous apparently.<br> It happened late yesterday, but his<br> parents didnt want to call you.<br> I see.<br> In fact, they don't that<br> I'm calling you now.<br> But I thought that you should know.<br> Thank you.<br> I know this must be quite a shock.<br> It was for all of us.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> - Will there be a service?<br> - The day after tomorrow.<br> Well, I suppose I should<br> get off the phone...<br> ...and book a plane flight.<br> The service is just for family.<br> For family, of course.<br> Well, thank you for calling.<br> - Mr. Ackerley?<br> - Yes?<br> - May I ask what happened to the dogs?<br> - Dogs?<br> There was a dog with him but he died.<br> Was there another one?<br> Yes, there was a small female.<br> I don't know, I'm sorry.<br> I haven't heard anyone<br> mentioning another dog.<br> - Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.<br> Hello, Charley.<br> How did you know it was me?<br> Charlotte, nobody else calls me<br> before eight in the morning.<br> I didn't call too early, did I?<br> You sound grumpy.<br> No, I have a headache.<br> Listen, I was going to call you actually.<br> Is too late to change my mind about tonight.<br> No, of course not.<br> I haven't seen you all week.<br> - I'm dying for a dose of you.<br> - I know, I'm sorry.<br> So great, I'll see you tonight.<br> I have to run.<br> I'm late for the work.<br> I'll call you later from school.<br> Alright, I see you then.<br> - Bye, kiddo.<br> - Bye, old man.<br> Good morning, Mr. George.<br> Sir, you don't look so good today.<br> Good morning, Alva.<br> No, I didn't sleep very well.<br> You forgot to take the bread<br> out of the freezer this morning.<br> It stays fresh that way.<br> It was a little too fresh this morning.<br> There are some papers<br> laid out on my desk...<br> ...which need to stay there.<br> Please don't move them.<br> - I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.<br> - It's okay, sir.<br> - Alva?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Thank you, you're a wonderful.<br> This government, as promised,<br> has maintained the closest surveillance...<br> ...of the Soviet military buildup<br> on the Island of Cuba.<br> Within the past week unmistakable evidence...<br> ...has established the fact...<br> - Professor Falconer?<br> - Yes?<br> There was a student here this<br> morning asking for your address.<br> My address?<br> - Did you give it to him?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I did.<br> I hope that's okay.<br> I realize that I probably shouldn't<br> have but he was very nice.<br> Before I knew it he...<br> Your hair looks great up like that.<br> I really fits suits you.<br> You always look so beautiful...<br> ...really fresh...<br> You have such a lovely smile.<br> - Arpge?<br> - Sir?<br> Really beautiful.<br> ...that a series of offensive missile sites...<br> - Good morning, Don.<br> - Good morning, George.<br> Good morning, George.<br> Good morning, Grant.<br> You look awful.<br> What have you been doing?<br> Look around you, Grant.<br> Most of these students aspire to<br> nothing more than corporate job...<br> ...and a desire to raise coke-drinking,<br> TV-watching children...<br> ...who as soon as they can<br> speak start chanting TV jingles...<br> ...and smashing things with hammers.<br> - You're really scaring me today, George.<br> Don't tell me. You have<br> easy time with these students.<br> I found them staring at me<br> in a kind of bovine stupor...<br> ...as if I were lecturing in<br> a foreign language.<br> Remind me why we shouldn't<br> all just be annihilated.<br> You seem to think this is all a joke.<br> We're living in a world where<br> nuclear war is a real threat.<br> I don't understand how<br> that doesn't concern you.<br> You're serious, aren't you?<br> Yes, I'm serious.<br> George did you even read the article<br> I gave you on bomb shelters?<br> Our is almost done. We had 3<br> contractors work on it...<br> ...so none of them know what we've got.<br> I'm having the outside of it landscaped<br> so no one will that it's there.<br> Really?<br> If word gets out that<br> you've got a better shelter...<br> ...then everyone will try to get in<br> when something happens.<br> So?<br> There will be no time for sentiment<br> when the Russians fire a missile at us.<br> If it's going to be a world with<br> no time for sentiment Grant...<br> ...the it's not a world<br> that I want to live in.<br> After Many a Summer Dies the Swan.<br> I think you've all...<br> ...read the Huxley novel I assigned<br> more than three weeks ago?<br> How does the title relate to our story?<br> - Yes, Mr. Mong.<br> - It doesn't.<br> It's about a rich guy who's too<br> afraid that he's too old for this girl...<br> ...and thinks that a young guy...<br> Russ.<br> Russ?<br> Yes, Mr. Hirsch.<br> Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...<br> ...the stupidest text in the Bible is<br> they hated me without a cause.<br> Does that mean the Nazis were<br> right to hate the Jews?<br> - Is Huxley an anti-Semite?<br> - No.<br> No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.<br> Of course, the Nazis were<br> wrong to hate the Jews.<br> But their hating the Jews<br> was not without a cause.<br> It's just that the cause wasn't real.<br> The cause was imagined.<br> The cause was fear.<br> Let's leave the Jews out o<br> this just for a moment.<br> Let's think of another minority.<br> One that...<br> One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.<br> There are all sorts of minorities,<br> blondes for example...<br> ...or people with freckles.<br> But a minority is only<br> thought of as one...<br> ...when it constitutes some kind of<br> threat to the majority.<br> A real threat or an imagined one.<br> And therein lies the fear.<br> If the minority is somehow invisible...<br> ...and the fear is much greater.<br> That fear is why the<br> minority is persecuted.<br> So, you see there always is a cause.<br> The cause is fear.<br> Minorities are just people.<br> People like us.<br> I can see that I've lost you a bit.<br> So tell you what? We're gonna<br> forget about Mr. Huxley today...<br> ...and we're gonna talk about fear.<br> Fear, after all, is our real enemy.<br> Fear is taking over our world.<br> Fear is being used as a tool of<br> manipulation in our society.<br> It's how politicians peddle policy.<br> It's how Madison Avenue sells us<br> things that we don't need.<br> Think about it.<br> Fear of being attacked.<br> Fear of that there are communists<br> lurking around every corner.<br> Fear of that some little<br> Caribbean country...<br> ...that doesn't believe in our way<br> of life poses a threat to us.<br> Fear that black culture<br> may take over the world.<br> Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.<br> Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.<br> Fear that our bad breath<br> might ruin our friendships.<br> Fear of growing old and being alone.<br> The of that we're useless and that<br> no one cares what we have to say.<br> Have a good weekend.<br> Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?<br> Why don't you always<br> talk to us like that?<br> I don't think it went over very well.<br> Man, fear of things gets<br> to me all the time.<br> But you can't talk about it with<br> anyone or you just sound like a fool.<br> - You can't even talk about it with Lois?<br> - I don't think she's afraid of anything.<br> Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.<br> What are you afraid of, sir?<br> Cars.<br> How can you live in Los Angeles<br> and be afraid of cars?<br> Maybe you can't.<br> Sometimes my fear of things<br> can almost paralyze me.<br> It's like I get really panic stricken and<br> I feel like I might explode or something.<br> - May I ask you a personal question, sir?<br> - If you like.<br> Do you ever get high?<br> - How old do I look to you?<br> - Have you ever taken any drugs?<br> Of course, Kenny.<br> Like what?<br> I don't feel I should be discussing this<br> with you on campus Mr. Potter.<br> It's the only way I get by sometimes.<br> - Have you ever tried mescaline?<br> - Not my drug of choice.<br> I shaved off one of my eyebrows once<br> on mescaline. Not a good look for me.<br> - Sir?<br> - I looked in the mirror.<br> Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.<br> I decided that my eyebrows<br> were taking over my face.<br> Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.<br> I wore a band-aid over my eye for about<br> six weeks while my brow grew back.<br> Very embarrassing.<br> - You didn't take it again after that?<br> - Kenny, have you been listening to me?<br> I shaved off my eyebrow.<br> I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,<br> not a career on stage.<br> If you ever want to get high sir,<br> I usually have some dope.<br> You're really mad aren't you?<br> I'm sorry, sir. I guess you don't feel<br> very comfortable talking like this.<br> What makes you say that?<br> Lois thinks you're kind of cagey.<br> Like this morning...<br> ...when you were listening to all that<br> crap we were talking about Huxley.<br> Well, not all of you.<br> I didn't notice you open<br> your mouth once.<br> I was watching you.<br> You let us ramble on and on<br> and then you straighten us out.<br> But you never really tell us<br> everything you know about something.<br> Well, maybe that's true up to a point.<br> It's not that I want to be cagey.<br> It's just that I can't really discuss<br> things completely openly...<br> ...at school.<br> Someone would misunderstand.<br> I tried that today.<br> It didn't really work out.<br> What was it you wanted to get, sir?<br> Nothing. I was on my way<br> to the dean's office.<br> You mean you walked all the way<br> down here just to talk to me?<br> - Why not?<br> - Well...<br> I think you deserve<br> something for that, sir.<br> Here sir, take your pick.<br> - It's on me.<br> - Thank you.<br> I thought you'd probably pick blue.<br> - Why blue?<br> - Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?<br> What makes you think I'm spiritual?<br> And you? Red?<br> - What is red stand for?<br> - A lot of things.<br> Rage, lust.<br> No kidding?<br> Well sir, I...<br> I guess I see you around.<br> Hello?<br> What are you up to, kiddo?<br> Just trying to finish up a book.<br> How's your day going?<br> Fine.<br> I was just leaving school and wanted to<br> know if you needed anything for tonight.<br> Thanks, you're sweet.<br> But I think I'm all set.<br> Be a darling and...<br> ...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.<br> I love the color of the bottle.<br> You love what's in it.<br> What time do you want me?<br> Perfect. I'll see you then.<br> I'll see you then.<br> Bye, Geo.<br> Bye, kiddo.<br> Beautiful.<br> - Yes, Mr. Potter?<br> - Are you going somewhere, sir?<br> That is usually why people<br> get into their cars.<br> No, I mean are you going on<br> vacation or something?<br> - What?<br> - I saw you cleaning out your office.<br> What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?<br> I was just hoping that perhaps we could get<br> together for a drink or something sometime.<br> Why is that?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> Because I think you might like it.<br> And...<br> ...because you seem as though<br> you could use a friend.<br> - Oh really?<br> - Yes, sir. You do.<br> They may be right.<br> It will have to be another time.<br> I'm late.<br> But thank you for the invitation.<br> And thank you for the talk earlier.<br> And stay away from the mescaline.<br> Hello, Mr. Falconer.<br> - Hello. How are you today?<br> - I'm fine, sir.<br> - Do you need to get into your box?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Follow me.<br> Here you are, sir.<br> If you could please sign here...<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> So explain your friend Charlotte to me.<br> What would you like to know?<br> I don't know.<br> You seem very intimate I guess.<br> Like you were once<br> together or something.<br> - You haven't slept with her, have you?<br> - Yes.<br> And?<br> A few times when we were young.<br> I wouldn't say that it<br> meant nothing to me...<br> ...but it certainly meant<br> a great deal more to Charley.<br> It was a long time ago in London.<br> I love Charley.<br> - And We were very close friends<br> but that's all. - Well, I'm confused.<br> If you sleep with women<br> then why are you with me?<br> Because I fall in love with men.<br> Because I fell in love with you.<br> Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with<br> women when they're young?<br> - I haven't.<br> - You're joking.<br> No, I'm not.<br> It was just never anything<br> that interested me.<br> Well, you're awfully<br> modern aren't you?<br> You know, I think that was the first<br> thing that I noticed about you...<br> ...was how sure of yourself you were.<br> How can you be so sure about<br> everything at your age?<br> You think I'm sure of myself?<br> Of course, you are.<br> I'm finished now.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, Mr. Falconer?<br> Is there something else we<br> can help you with today?<br> I can't find my check book<br> and I need some cash.<br> Not my day I'm afraid.<br> Excuse me a minute.<br> Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,<br> but I think yours are pretty.<br> I think yours are pretty too.<br> Why do you look so sad?<br> Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?<br> Ben Hur.<br> He's our scorpion.<br> Every night we throw in something<br> new to him and watch him kill it.<br> Daddy says it's like the colosseum. So my<br> brother Tom put on all the columns in here.<br> He wants to be a set designer.<br> He hasn't eaten the spider yet...<br> ...cause he's still full from<br> the moth we gave him last night.<br> Daddy says he wants to throw<br> you in to the colosseum.<br> No kidding?<br> Why?<br> He says you're light in your loafers...<br> ...but you aren't even wearing loafers.<br> I think my brother Tom is<br> light in his loafers too...<br> ...but he wears Keds.<br> He made me do a hair conditioning<br> treatment on my hair with eggs.<br> Does it look shiny?<br> Sweetheart, what are you doing<br> bothering Mr. Falconer?<br> She's not bothering me at all Susan.<br> How are you?<br> I'm glad to see you George.<br> George, we're having a few people<br> over tonight for drinks...<br> ...and would love to have you<br> join us if you could.<br> - Thank you. That's very kind of you but I<br> have plans. - Another time then.<br> Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get<br> back to his banking.<br> Goodbye, George.<br> Bye, Susan.<br> Bye, Jennifer.<br> - May I help you, sir? - I'd like to buy<br> some bullets for this gun, please.<br> Yes, sir.<br> This is a really old gun, sir.<br> We have a two for one sale on<br> handguns at the moment.<br> - Perhaps one for the little lady?<br> - No thank you. Just the bullets, please.<br> - Here you go. Anything else?<br> - No, thank you.<br> That would be $2.29, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sorry. I hope she<br> didn't growl at you.<br> She goes a little crazy sometimes when<br> I have to leave her in the car.<br> She's perfect.<br> What's her name?<br> India.<br> Let's go there.<br> You little baby.<br> I used to have smooth fox terriers.<br> You don't see them very often.<br> The very smell of buttered toast.<br> She's still a puppy isn't she?<br> Well.<br> - Have a nice evening.<br> - You too.<br> Good night, India.<br> - I'm sorry about that.<br> - No, It's ok.<br> - It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.<br> - It's ok. Don't worry.<br> No, no I insist.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sorry about the broken glass.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thanks man.<br> You want one?<br> No, thanks.<br> Actually, yes.<br> Why not?<br> Thank you.<br> - Carlos.<br> - What did you say?<br> Carlos. You asked me my name.<br> Are you okay?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I'm sorry.<br> You're really something.<br> You have an incredible face.<br> Enjoy that. It's a great gift.<br> Your Spanish is perfect.<br> Thank you.<br> I should have used it more.<br> Well...<br> It's not too late.<br> What are you doing?<br> Aren't we going somewhere?<br> No. But, thanks.<br> You know, it's the smog that<br> makes it that color.<br> I've never seen a sky like this before.<br> Sometimes awful things have<br> their own kind of beauty.<br> Could I have another cigarette?<br> Sure.<br> - Are sure that you don't want to go<br> for a drive? - I'm sure.<br> - Where are you from?<br> - Madrid.<br> Madrid?<br> How did you get here?<br> It's a long story.<br> I met a guy from LA at the<br> hotel where I worked...<br> ...who told me I could live with him<br> and that he could get me an agent.<br> But he never realized that<br> I have a Spanish accent.<br> I like your accent.<br> You speak very well.<br> - How did you learn English? - My mom had<br> an American boyfriend when I was little.<br> Is your mother in Madrid?<br> Yes, she is.<br> She cuts hair.<br> She cut my hair before I left.<br> Do you like it?<br> - I thought it made me look like James Dean.<br> - You are better than James Dean.<br> Really?<br> Thanks.<br> No one has ever picked me up<br> and not wanted something.<br> I think you picked me up.<br> This is kind of a serious day for me.<br> Come on. What could be<br> so serious for a guy like you?<br> I'm just trying to get over<br> an old love I guess.<br> My mother says that<br> lovers are like buses.<br> You just have to wait a little while<br> and another one comes along.<br> I have to go.<br> You're a nice guy.<br> I hope you find...<br> ...someone like you.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm going away.<br> It's your turn to change it.<br> Yeah, I'm not changing it.<br> It's your turn.<br> Besides, you never like<br> what I put on anyway.<br> I'll give you five dollars if you<br> change it. I'm too old to get up.<br> You're only old when it's<br> convenient for you to be old.<br> What are you reading anyway?<br> Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.<br> It's for my class.<br> What highbrow work of fiction<br> might you be reading?<br> Don't be so smug.<br> Man, what a life he has.<br> - Don't you just envy him?<br> - Why?<br> Because he can sniff<br> anyone's arse he wants?<br> Nice.<br> No, because he just does what he wants.<br> Like yesterday...<br> ...I was standing in the front yard<br> and Susan came over to talk.<br> And that little brat of hers<br> Christopher came...<br> ...running over waving that<br> damned gun of his around.<br> And our little dog walked<br> right up, hiked his leg...<br> ...and peed all over Christopher's<br> new tennis shoes.<br> All over Christopher actually.<br> And of course, I had<br> to act like I was upset<br> It was so perfectly executed<br> you should have seen it.<br> After all the times those kids<br> have tortured that poor dog.<br> I mean, you should take a<br> lesson from him. They don't...<br> They don't stay up all night worrying.<br> They figured out how to get the two<br> of us to do exactly what they want.<br> They are basically very sophisticated<br> little parasites when you think about it.<br> Well, the dumbest creatures are the<br> happiest. Just look at your mother.<br> He's really just living the moment.<br> It's like now.<br> What could be better than<br> being tucked up here with you?<br> If I died right now it would be OK.<br> Well, it wouldn't be OK with me so why don't<br> you shut up and go change the record.<br> Good answer.<br> You know what? I was thinking<br> about taking them up...<br> ...to Denver with me next week<br> if it's okay with you.<br> It's my mom.<br> She loves them.<br> Probably that recognition<br> of a similar mind.<br> You stay there, old man.<br> No, I did not forget the gin.<br> I'll see you in ten minutes.<br> Christopher, would you<br> like it if I killed you?<br> I don't know.<br> If you keep this up<br> we're going to find out.<br> So, why don't you go home<br> and stop shooting people?<br> I'm so happy to see you.<br> Come on in.<br> It smells wonderful.<br> I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?<br> I gave her the night off.<br> I'm cooking myself.<br> - You are?<br> - Yes, I'm trying something new.<br> - Charley darling, ''you cooking' is new.<br> - Don't be smart.<br> I'm in a good mood tonight.<br> I'm going to be fun.<br> I've already made two<br> New Year's resolutions.<br> Resolution one: No more talk<br> that of awful ex-husbands...<br> ..and children who don't give a damn.<br> - And the other one?<br> - One what?<br> Resolution.<br> Resolution two: More smoking and more<br> drinking and screw it all! So come on...<br> ...mix me up a drink.<br> I'll have a gin and tonic, please.<br> - And watch out baby!<br> - Coming up.<br> - It was sweet of you to come tonight.<br> - Sweet had nothing to do with it.<br> - I needed to see you.<br> - Come off it.<br> Whenever you do something sweet<br> you're too ashamed to admit it.<br> Here is to our early<br> New Year's resolutions.<br> Cheers.<br> What are your resolutions by the way?<br> To let go of the past completely,<br> entirely, and forever.<br> Light me up, will you?<br> Darling, you dont look well.<br> Do you remember that little<br> heart attack you had last year?<br> - It wasnt a heart attack.<br> - Well whatever it was darling...<br> ...you dont look so hot.<br> Im fine.<br> I never felt better.<br> - I'm a little tired. I haven't<br> been sleeping... - Geo, it's normal.<br> You were with Jim for 16 years.<br> I think about Richard every day.<br> Its hard being alone.<br> At least you have a job and a life.<br> Lets have a bit of dinner shall we?<br> Because Ive worked so very hard.<br> - What are you talking about? - Seriously,<br> there no such thing as old anymore.<br> The other day one of my students<br> has called me a senior citizen.<br> I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...<br> ...but I'm not sure senior is<br> what I'm aiming for either.<br> It's all becoming so bland.<br> It's not why I came to America.<br> It's like a complete breakdown<br> of culture and manners.<br> The young ones have no manners.<br> The other day at the car wash<br> a young man looked me up and down...<br> ...and actually asked me if I<br> was a natural blonde.<br> - What did you say?<br> - I looked him straight in the eye...<br> ...and said: ''Let's just say<br> if I stood on my head...<br> ...I would be a natural<br> brunette with lovely breath.<br> - You didn't!<br> - I did!<br> And the amusing thing was<br> that it went right over his head!<br> You know, you had a mouth on you<br> even back in London.<br> Do you remember that old lesbian<br> who threw her drink over your head...<br> ...because you asked her if<br> she was hung like a donut.<br> Geo.<br> We could always go back to London.<br> The two of us.<br> - No, thanks.<br> - You know you miss it.<br> I miss it sometimes.<br> Maybe if Jim had lived.<br> He loved being in England. He asked us<br> to stay the last time we were there.<br> Do you really think you<br> would have moved?<br> I don't know. It's silly to even talk<br> about it. It was only a fantasy.<br> What's this?<br> It's my mother's wedding ring.<br> I found it a drawer<br> when I was cleaning out.<br> Charley my dear, you and I are<br> both in need of another drink.<br> Wait!<br> Wait, wait!<br> I love this!<br> - You're insane!<br> - Come on, old man!<br> Don't move.<br> Thank you.<br> - Very smooth cigarette move.<br> - I've always wanted to do that.<br> You don't even smoke.<br> Well, not for the last<br> sixteen years. Jim hated it.<br> What's to stop me now?<br> It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.<br> This is so nice, lying here with you.<br> Don't you ever miss this?<br> What we could have been to each other?<br> Having a real relationship and kids?<br> - I had Jim.<br> - I know, but I mean a real relationship.<br> Geo, let's be honest, what you and Jim<br> had together was wonderful but...<br> ...wasn't it really just a<br> substitute for something else?<br> Is that really what you think<br> after all of these years?<br> You think Jim was just some<br> kind of substitute for real love?<br> Jim was not a substitute for anything.<br> Do you understand?<br> There is no substitute for Jim...<br> ...anywhere!<br> And by the way, what is so real<br> about your relationship with Richard?<br> He left you after nine years!<br> Jim and I were together<br> for sixteen years!<br> And if he hadn't died we<br> would still be together!<br> What the hell is not real about that?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I know how much the two<br> of you loved each other.<br> I suppose I'm just jealous that<br> you and I never had that kind of love.<br> Actually, I've never had that<br> kind of love with anybody.<br> I don't think Richard ever loved me...<br> ...except for the way I looked.<br> And Clay...<br> I don't know. You raise<br> a child and love it...<br> ...and then when they are<br> old enough they just leave.<br> Charley, there is nothing<br> wrong with your life.<br> You just like feeling sorry for yourself.<br> It's one of your great pleasures.<br> And it's not one of yours?<br> You're as pathetic as I am.<br> Feeling sorry for myself is definitely<br> not one of my great pleasures.<br> Well, it's not one of mine either. I don't<br> like feeling sorry for myself one bit.<br> I tried to hold onto<br> Richard for so long...<br> ...even when it was obvious to<br> everyone but me that it was over.<br> And now Clay is grown up.<br> I mean, what am I doing here Geo?<br> Tell me, what?<br> You have plenty of friends.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Yes, I have friends.<br> But none of them need me.<br> And yes I have you and if you weren't such a<br> goddamn poof we could have all been happy!<br> I only have you now<br> because you lost Jim.<br> Soon I'll lose you to someone else.<br> It's not as easy for a woman.<br> I've done everything the way<br> I was supposed to and...<br> ...all I have to keep me<br> company is a bottle of gin.<br> Maybe you should try<br> donuts with your gin.<br> Screw you.<br> Charlotte, you are dramatic.<br> I swear you really almost had me.<br> A tiny tear was beginning to<br> form in the corner of my eye.<br> Now stop it.<br> You are still<br> breathtakingly beautiful.<br> When you can be bothered<br> to get up and out of bed...<br> ...and you stop whimpering about<br> everything for five minutes.<br> Go to London.<br> Change your life.<br> If you're not happy being a woman<br> then stop acting like one.<br> You have all the answers.<br> No, I don't have any to mention.<br> If you're so smart why don't you<br> have something new in your life?<br> Take that position at Stanford.<br> You complain about that little school<br> but you could go anywhere you want.<br> I think what I've done<br> has been worthwhile.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I shouldn't have said that.<br> As much as I dread it, I think<br> I will go back to London.<br> Why do you dread it?<br> When I lived in London last I was<br> young. I was fresh, I was everything.<br> Coming to America was such a dream,<br> it was the icing on the cake.<br> Going home is defeat.<br> None of it really worked<br> out the way I'd planned.<br> Most things don't work out<br> the way people plan.<br> You're just living in the past. You need<br> to start thinking about your future.<br> Living in the past is my future.<br> It doesn't have to be yours.<br> You're a man.<br> And you're a bore tonight.<br> Can't we just feel sorry for<br> ourselves a little bit longer?<br> Let's have another drink.<br> - I don't think so. I have to go. Come on.<br> Walk me out. - Please, please!<br> - Come on, I have to!<br> - No, this was such fun! No.<br> When will I see you again?<br> - Aren't you going to England?<br> - I'll never do that!<br> It's far too much effort.<br> Besides, I don't think Jim would want me<br> to leave you here in LA all alone.<br> Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.<br> I've got all the answers. Remember?<br> What are you doing this weekend?<br> I think I might just be very quiet.<br> You never really did take me<br> seriously, did you George?<br> I tried to Charley. Remember?<br> A long time ago.<br> It didn't really work out, did it?<br> No, Charley.<br> Sleep tight.<br> Patrick, a beer and a<br> packet of Lucky Strike, please.<br> Excuse me.<br> It's too hot in there.<br> Yes, it is.<br> - Would you like a cigarette?<br> - No thanks, I don't smoke.<br> - This place is really crowded.<br> - Well, it is Saturday night.<br> It's usually as bad as this.<br> People normally just stop by and pick<br> someone up and then head on down the beach.<br> Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.<br> I'm surprised the cops<br> don't break it up.<br> - Is it always like that?<br> - Since the war ended.<br> It's pretty great actually.<br> It's kind of pagan.<br> - I'm Jim.<br> - I'm George.<br> Pleased to meet you Jim.<br> I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some<br> friends but I can't find them.<br> I just needed to get out of the house<br> but the lure of a cold beer got to me.<br> Do you live hereby?<br> Canyon.<br> - For how long?<br> - Since 38.<br> - Where are you from?<br> - Colorado.<br> I really like it here.<br> It's close to beach.<br> I think I might stay after<br> I'm discharged.<br> I don't know, maybe<br> I'm a bit of a pagan.<br> - After you.<br> - No.<br> Sorry.<br> - Well, hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Do you buy me a drink?<br> I think I'm taken.<br> Too bad, too bad.<br> Do you want another beer?<br> Patrick, a bottle of scotch and<br> a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?<br> Patrick, cancel that.<br> Well, hello Mr. Potter.<br> Hello, sir.<br> - What are we drinking?<br> - Scotch.<br> Okay.<br> I come here all the time. I live just<br> around the corner, but then you knew that.<br> On Camphor Tree Lane.<br> You're still carrying that around.<br> One must always appreciate<br> life's little gifts.<br> So, what are you doing here?<br> - Just out for a ride on my bike.<br> - Is that all?<br> I don't know.<br> Were you looking for me?<br> Maybe. I don't know.<br> I feel like my head's<br> stopped up with stuff.<br> What kind of stuff?<br> Like, the stuff you were talking<br> about today in class.<br> That is definitely not important.<br> No, it is important.<br> Your class is great.<br> But somehow we always seem<br> to get stuck talking about the past.<br> The past just doesn't matter to me.<br> - The present?<br> - I can't wait for the present to be over.<br> It's a total drag.<br> Well, tonight is the exception.<br> What?<br> Tonight, yes!<br> The present, no!<br> Let's drink to tonight.<br> Tonight.<br> So if the past doesn't matter and<br> the present is a total drag.<br> What about the future?<br> What future?<br> Cuba might just blow us up.<br> Death is the future.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't mean to be depressing.<br> It's not depressing.<br> It's not depressing, it's true.<br> It may not be your immediate future<br> but it's what we all share.<br> Death is the future.<br> You're right, I guess.<br> If one is not enjoying one's present<br> there isn't a great deal to...<br> ...suggest that the future<br> should be any better.<br> Yeah, I've thought that before.<br> But the thing is you just never know.<br> Look at tonight.<br> Actually...<br> ...I feel really alone most of the time.<br> - You do?<br> - Yeah.<br> I've always felt this way.<br> I mean we're born alone, we die alone.<br> And while we're here we are absolutely,<br> completely sealed in our own bodies.<br> Really weird.<br> Kinda freaks me out to think about it.<br> We can only experience the outside world<br> through our own slanted perception of it.<br> Who knows what you're really like?<br> - I just see what I think you're like.<br> - I'm exactly what I appear to be.<br> If you look closely.<br> You know the only thing that has made<br> the whole thing worthwhile...<br> ...has been those...<br> ...few times that I've been able to really,<br> truly connect with another human being.<br> I had a hunch about you, sir.<br> - You did?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I had a hunch you might<br> be a real romantic.<br> You know, everyone<br> keeps telling you that...<br> ...when you're older, that you'll<br> have all this experience.<br> Like it's some great thing.<br> That's a load of shit.<br> I think I've actually just<br> gotten sillier and sillier.<br> - Really?<br> - Absolutely.<br> So, all your experience is useless.<br> No, I wouldn't say that.<br> As our friend Mr. Huxley says:<br> Experience is not what happens to a man.<br> It is what a man does<br> with what happens to him.<br> - Let's go swimming.<br> - Okay.<br> - What?<br> - It was a test.<br> I thought you were<br> bluffing about being silly so...<br> ...I said to myself I'll suggest doing<br> something completely outrageous.<br> And if he resists, if he even hesitates<br> then I know he's full of shit.<br> Well, I wasn't.<br> Were you?<br> Hell, no!<br> Come on sir.<br> I'll help you down.<br> Let's go.<br> Come on, sir.<br> Sir?<br> Sir?<br> That's enough for now, sir.<br> - I'm fine.<br> - I'm cold. Come on.<br> Can we go back to your place, sir?<br> Of course.<br> Where else?<br> - Where else.<br> - Are you out of your mind?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - You can't get home like that!<br> We're invisible, don't you know that?<br> You know sir, they ought not<br> to let you out on your own.<br> You're liable to get into real trouble.<br> I excel at it.<br> Your forehead is bleeding.<br> The bathroom is just down the hall<br> if you would like to take a shower.<br> Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?<br> I'm fine. I'm English.<br> We like to be cold and wet.<br> First, I think that we need<br> to take care of that cut, sir.<br> Do you have any band-aids?<br> - Going camping, sir?<br> - I'm fine, really.<br> Stay there.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Sit up.<br> Tilt your head back.<br> Well sir, I'm afraid this<br> time you don't have...<br> ...the excuse of mescaline<br> to explain your band-aid.<br> I think we should get you<br> out of those wet clothes.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - You're not too cold?<br> - I'm great.<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - A beer, sir. If you have one.<br> I'm afraid that's all we have.<br> Two beers coming up.<br> - You live here all by yourself, sir?<br> - I do now.<br> I used to share this place with<br> a friend. He was an architect.<br> Man, guys my age dream about the<br> kind of setup you've got here.<br> I mean, what more can you want?<br> You get to be left alone and<br> come and go as you please.<br> Is that's your idea of the perfect life?<br> What's the matter, sir?<br> Don't you believe me?<br> If you're so keen on the<br> idea living by yourself...<br> ...where does Lois fit into this plan?<br> Lois? What's she got to<br> do with anything?<br> I got the impression that you<br> and she were together.<br> Not really.<br> She is kind of cool and...<br> ...we're good friends but...<br> I think what you really want to<br> ask me is if we sleep together.<br> - And do you?<br> - We did. Once.<br> - Why only once?<br> - I didn't say only once, I said once.<br> Come on, the last thing I want to<br> talk about right now is Lois.<br> What time is it?<br> My watch seems to have stopped.<br> Do you want me to go?<br> You must be kidding.<br> Go, get us another beer.<br> Is that an order, sir?<br> You're damn right it is.<br> Pathetic.<br> Did you say something, sir?<br> Why are you here?<br> Why did you get to the office and<br> ask secretary for my address?<br> I just wanted to see you<br> someplace other than school.<br> Why?<br> Sometimes I think I'm crazy cause I see<br> things so differently than everyone else.<br> I feel like I can talk to you.<br> To be honest sir, I was also<br> worried about you today.<br> Me?<br> What's to be worried about?<br> I'm fine.<br> I'm...<br> I'm fine.<br> A few times in my life I've had<br> moments of absolute clarity.<br> When for a few brief seconds...<br> ...the silence drowns out the noise...<br> ...and I can feel rather than think.<br> And things seem so sharp...<br> And the world seems so fresh...<br> ...as though it had all<br> just come into existence.<br> I can never make these moments last.<br> I cling to them...<br> ...but like everything they fade.<br> I've lived my live on these moments.<br> They pull me back to the present...<br> ...and I realize that everything is<br> exactly the way it was meant to be.<br> And just like that it came.<br>
