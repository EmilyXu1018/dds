But just a few.<br> I promised the boys.<br> Take your hands off me!<br> And don't make any promises for me.<br> I will break them.

I need a drink before I go on.<br> Get me a drink, I'll let you take a picture.<br> - That's a deal.<br> - Two drinks, two pictures.<br> Three drinks, three pictures.<br> Three pictures.<br> You're not a bad fellow, Libby.<br> Why do you disgust me?<br> Why do I hate you so, Libby?<br> I wouldn't know about that, Norman.<br> - Let's have another one.<br> - That does it.<br> - A few more.<br> - I said, "That does it."<br> But you've got plenty of time.<br> All right, no more pictures.<br> Get your pencils out, boys.<br> I'm sorry, gentlemen, no time.<br> - Come on.<br> - You've got plenty of time.<br> Are you trying to stop me?<br> Are you trying to stop me from going on?<br> Is that it?<br> - What a story this will make!<br> - This guy is stewed.<br> "What a spot this<br> "Not so hot this<br> "Hey, there, shy one<br> "Come be my one<br> "Please, don't rush off<br> "What, no brush off?<br> "I can't compel you to buy what I'd sell you<br> "But I'd like to tell you like so<br> "You wanna have bells that'll ring<br> "You wanna have songs that'll sing<br> "You want your sky of baby blue<br> "You gotta have me go with you<br> "Hey, you fool, you<br> "Why so cool, you?<br> "When I'm ready to go steady<br> "You wanna have eyes that'll shine<br> "You wanna have grapes on the vine<br> "You want a love that's truly true<br> "You gotta have me go with you<br> "Why the hold out?<br> "Have you sold out?<br> "Time you woke up<br> "Time you spoke up<br> "This line I'm handing you<br> "Is not a handout<br> "As a team we'd be a standout<br> Standout!<br> "You wanna live high on a dime<br> "You wanna have two hearts in rhyme<br> "You gotta have me...<br> "...go with you<br> "You gotta have me<br> "You gotta have me<br> "Oh, all the time<br> "Why the hold out?<br> "Have you sold out?<br> "Time you woke up<br> "Time you spoke up<br> "You want your sky of baby blue<br> "You gotta have me go with you<br> "Why the hold out?<br> "Have you sold out?<br> "Time you woke up<br> "Time you spoke up<br> "This line I'm handing you<br> "Is not a handout<br> "As a team we'd be a standout<br> "You wanna live high on a dime<br> "You wanna have two hearts that rhyme<br> "You gotta have me go with you<br> "All of the time"<br> Esther.<br> Yes.<br> Hi, girls.<br> - Esther, if you hurry we can have coffee.<br> - All right.<br> - Good night.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Danny.<br> - Yeah?<br> Here, wait just a second.<br> I must have chewed my lips off wondering<br> if he was coming back on.<br> I've never been so afraid.<br> My knees were shaking.<br> Was I on key? I couldn't hear.<br> - You were on pitch all the way.<br> - It's a wonder.<br> It's a wonder to me<br> that Mr. Norman Maine is still in pictures.<br> It is indeed.<br> In fact I ask it myself every morning<br> when I'm shaving.<br> I say, "Mirror, mirror on the wall...<br> "...who is the greatest star of them all?"<br> Do you know what the mirror answers?<br> Norman Maine?<br> Absolutely correct, Miss...<br> Blodgett. Esther Blodgett.<br> You must've been born with that name.<br> You couldn't have made it up.<br> - I was born with it.<br> - Excuse me.<br> You wouldn't make up a name like that,<br> would you?<br> That's a brand new lipstick.<br> To mark the occasion when...<br> ...Esther Blodgett...<br> ...saved Norman Maine...<br> ...from making even more a fool<br> of himself than usual.<br> I thank you. My studio thanks you.<br> All the legions and codes...<br> ...that watch over our industry<br> will be equally pleased, I'm sure.<br> Would you take supper with me?<br> And all the people with you, too.<br> I'm afraid we can't, Mr. Maine.<br> You see, we're working at the Grove.<br> This is Danny McGuire, our pianist.<br> Bring your piano along, Mr. McGuire.<br> Nobody can object to a good, clean,<br> living American piano.<br> But I insist on your taking supper with me.<br> Come on.<br> Don't you try to stop me, Mr. McGuire.<br> I know myself extremely well.<br> I'm just near the fighting stage<br> at the moment.<br> If I don't get my way, I'll begin to break up<br> people and things at this moment.<br> You understand, don't you?<br> Yes, I understand.<br> Why don't we have supper sometime later?<br> Maybe tomorrow or the next night.<br> I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll lay in a whole supply of lipsticks<br> and we'll celebrate all over the walls.<br> - Please, Miss Blodgett.<br> - Good night.<br> I think I see your friends, Mr. Maine.<br> Let's hit the road.<br> Darling, you were simply divine.<br> Simply divine.<br> You were swell.<br> You know, drunk or not, he's nice.<br> He's awful nice.<br> Just darling. Come on.<br> When he goes off like that,<br> he's good for the night, Mr. Libby.<br> He'll smile in his sleep in a minute.<br> Like a child.<br> Like a child with a blowtorch.<br> What, sir?<br> Nothing.<br> Mr. Maine's charm escapes me.<br> It always has.<br> Now, you understand, 6:00 sharp.<br> Have him dressed and ready.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Here are his car keys. Hide them, will you?<br> I've had enough of Mr. Maine for one night.<br> He's good for the night.<br> He'll sure be surprised when<br> he finds himself on location in the morning.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Maine.<br> - Hello, Bruno. How are you?<br> There's a little dark girl,<br> sings with the Glenn Williams Orchestra.<br> The Glenn Williams Orchestra finishes<br> at 1:30, Mr. Maine.<br> Then the rhumba band takes over.<br> They finished about an hour ago.<br> It doesn't matter, Bruno.<br> The whole thing seems rather silly now.<br> I'll tell you something, Mr. Maine.<br> All the bands that play here,<br> the musicians, you know...<br> ...they go to a little place<br> on Sunset Boulevard after they finish.<br> And maybe the girl could be there.<br> They're crazy people, you know.<br> They blow their heads off here all night.<br> Then instead of going to bed,<br> they go to this little place...<br> ...and blow their heads off there<br> for themselves, for nothing!<br> Would you like a table, sir?<br> Not unless you wish<br> to rhumba with me, Bruno.<br> Is there anyone here that I know?<br> Well now, let's see.<br> There's a new little girl from Paramount.<br> That one there, yes.<br> She's very pretty, Mr. Maine.<br> She's with someone, isn't she?<br> Only her agent.<br> He'll be glad to leave.<br> Too young. I had a very young week<br> last week.<br> It's not worth it.<br> Is there anyone else?<br> Miss Sheldon.<br> She's very beautiful tonight, Mr. Maine.<br> No. She hit me over the head<br> with a bottle.<br> Yes, I remember it. It happened right here.<br> - I thought everything was all right by now.<br> - Nope, they only hit me once.<br> The little girl in the green dress?<br> No, Mr. Maine.<br> Pasadena.<br> Leave it alone.<br> Will you excuse me? I'll be right back.<br> Go ahead.<br> Take it, honey. Come on.<br> Take it from the top.<br> - From the top?<br> - Yeah.<br> "The night is bitter<br> "The stars have lost their glitter<br> "The winds grow colder<br> "Suddenly you're older<br> "And all because of the man that got away<br> "No more, his eager call<br> "The writing's on the wall<br> "The dreams you've dreamed<br> "Have all gone astray<br> "The man that won you<br> "Has run off and undone you<br> "That great beginning<br> "Has seen a final inning<br> "Don't know what happened<br> "It's all a crazy game!<br> "No more, that all-time thrill<br> "For you've been through the mill<br> "And never a new love will be the same<br> "Good riddance, goodbye<br> "Every trick of his, you're onto<br> "But fools will be fools<br> "And where's he gone to?<br> "The road gets rougher<br> "It's lonelier and tougher<br> "With hope, you burn up<br> "Tomorrow he will turn up<br> "There's just no letup<br> "The livelong night and day<br> "Ever since this world began<br> "There is nothing sadder than<br> "A one-man woman<br> "Looking for the man that got away<br> "The man that got away"<br> It's wonderful.<br> Pretty good, we finished together...<br> Oh, no! No!<br> What's the matter?<br> Your dancing partner has returned.<br> How do you suppose he found us?<br> - I'll get rid of him.<br> - No, I'll do it.<br> Hello, Mr. Maine.<br> You turn up in the strangest places.<br> Don't I, though?<br> And you're cold sober.<br> Well, you'd better make the most of it.<br> Sit down for a moment.<br> Do you always sing like that?<br> Like what?<br> The way you sang just now.<br> Why?<br> I've never heard anybody sing<br> just the way you do.<br> What do you mean? Good or bad?<br> Here.<br> You ever go fishing?<br> Well, do you like prizefights?<br> Ever watched a great fighter?<br> I'm trying to tell you how you sing.<br> Do you mean like a prizefighter or a fish?<br> Look.<br> Here.<br> There are certain pleasures that you get...<br> There are certain pleasures you get,<br> little jabs of pleasure...<br> ...when a swordfish takes the hook,<br> or when you watch a great fighter...<br> ...getting ready for the kill, see?<br> You don't understand a word I'm saying,<br> do you?<br> No, not yet. Why don't you try bullfights?<br> You're joking, but that's exactly<br> what I mean.<br> You'd know a great bullfighter<br> the moment he stepped into the ring.<br> From the way he stood,<br> from the way he moved.<br> Or a dancer. You don't have<br> to know about ballet.<br> That little bell rings inside your head...<br> ...that little jolt of pleasure.<br> That's what happened to me just now.<br> You're a great singer.<br> Who, me?<br> Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?<br> No, Mr. Maine,<br> no one's ever told me that before.<br> Maybe you're not quite as sober<br> as we both thought you were.<br> But, thank you.<br> I'm as sober as a judge<br> and I know exactly what I'm saying.<br> You've got that little something extra<br> that Ellen Terry talked about.<br> Ellen Terry, great actress<br> long before you were born.<br> She said that's what star quality was...<br> ...that little something extra.<br> Well, you've got it.<br> Now, what are you doing wasting<br> your time singing with this band?<br> Wasting my time?<br> I'm not wasting my time.<br> You don't know how many years<br> it's taken me to get this far.<br> - I'm doing fine, Mr. Maine, just great.<br> - You're wasting your time.<br> Now, tell me about yourself.<br> Where'd you come from?<br> How'd you start singing?<br> Have you got a family? Are you married?<br> No.<br> We're breaking it up.<br> Why, hello, Mr. McGuire.<br> Mr. Maine.<br> - Ready to go home?<br> - Yes.<br> Good.<br> I'll see that Esther gets home.<br> - All right, Esther?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll see you at the bus<br> in the morning, Danny.<br> Yeah, at 6:00.<br> Okay.<br> - Good night.<br> - Yeah, good night.<br> Well, go on. Go ahead.<br> Do you know the only thing<br> I can think of right now?<br> The only thought that comes into my mind<br> is the way I wash my hair.<br> You see, when anything happens to me,<br> good or bad...<br> ...I make straight for the shampoo bottle.<br> Why would I have to think of that now?<br> I understand that perfectly.<br> With me it's golf balls.<br> If I'm happy or if I'm miserable,<br> I putt golf balls around the living room.<br> It makes perfect sense. Go ahead.<br> I'm afraid I'm no good at talking<br> about myself, Mr. Maine.<br> Everything just runs together.<br> Runs together? How?<br> All over the place.<br> Washing out my gloves<br> in crummy hotel rooms.<br> And winning a contest on the radio.<br> And singing in joints.<br> You see how my mind works?<br> It's all jumbled.<br> I can sort it out.<br> Can you?<br> I can't.<br> I can remember my first job singing<br> with the band.<br> And then, one-night stands clear<br> across country by bus.<br> Putting on nail polish in the ladies' rooms<br> in gas stations.<br> Waiting on tables...<br> Wow, that was a low point.<br> I'll never forget it...<br> ...and I'll never, never do that again.<br> No matter what.<br> But I had to sing.<br> I somehow feel most alive<br> when I'm singing.<br> It's like...<br> You don't want to hear all this, do you?<br> Do you mind?<br> Mind? No, I'm having a wonderful time.<br> Here, we turn here. I live on that street.<br> Is there anything more I should know<br> about your fascinating life?<br> There must be more.<br> There is. A whole scrapbook full.<br> Come in.<br> Well, have you had enough,<br> as the Republicans used to say?<br> You know about as much about me now<br> as I do myself.<br> But you see how long it's taken me<br> to get this far.<br> Now, all I need is just a little luck.<br> What kind of luck?<br> The kind of luck that every girl singer<br> with a band dreams of.<br> One night a talent scout<br> from a big record company will come in.<br> And he'll let me make a record.<br> Yes, and then?<br> The record'll become No. 1<br> on the hit parade.<br> Be played on the jukeboxes<br> all over the country and I'll be made.<br> End of dream.<br> - There's only one thing wrong with that.<br> - I know. It won't happen.<br> No, it might happen very easily.<br> Only the dream isn't big enough.<br> How long will you be playing at the Grove?<br> Tonight was our last night.<br> We leave for San Francisco in the morning.<br> Don't go.<br> What?<br> Quit. Leave the band. Stay on here.<br> Let me see what I can do for you.<br> I'll talk to Oliver Niles right away.<br> It's just a chance, but take it.<br> A chance?<br> Do you realize I'd be giving up everything<br> I ever worked for?<br> That's right. But it served its purpose.<br> Listen to me, Esther...<br> ...a career is a curious thing.<br> Talent isn't always enough.<br> You need a sense of timing,<br> an eye for seeing the turning point...<br> ...or recognizing the big chance<br> when it comes along and grabbing it.<br> A career can rest on a trifle.<br> Like us sitting here tonight.<br> Or it can turn on somebody's saying<br> to you:<br> "You're better than that.<br> You're better than you know."<br> Don't settle for the little dream.<br> Go on to the big one.<br> Scared? Scared to take the plunge?<br> Yes.<br> Say, what makes you so sure about me?<br> I heard you sing.<br> - Yeah, but that...<br> - I know, just my word.<br> But you know yourself, don't you?<br> You just needed somebody to tell you.<br> I'm certainly mixed up now.<br> I thought I was doing just fine.<br> Don't look so miserable.<br> You don't have to decide now.<br> Sleep on it. I'll call you in the morning.<br> Sleep on it.<br> You fixed me for sleep, all right.<br> Whether you do it or not,<br> don't ever forget how good you are.<br> Hang onto that.<br> Because I'm right.<br> Good night, Esther.<br> Good night, Mr. Maine. Thank you.<br> I just want to take another look at you.<br> Hello. Who is it?<br> Oliver?<br> Who?<br> Norman.<br> Oliver, just hold on a moment.<br> - Are you in jail? What have you done?<br> - Yeah, yeah...<br> No, no, I'm not!<br> This girl, it turns out, is a fabulous singer.<br> - You heard a girl sing.<br> - This girl...<br> - Isn't that nice?<br> - Don't make me mad.<br> Do you know the time?<br> This girl has a wonderful talent.<br> Listen, please.<br> Yes, yes, I hear you.<br> Every word.<br> You heard a girl sing.<br> What do you want me to do, applaud?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I hear you. Yep.<br> Anything.<br> Anything.<br> Thanks, Oliver.<br> Now, you go on back to sleep...<br> ...because I want you to be nice and fresh<br> in the morning when I bring her around.<br> Who is it?<br> It's me.<br> You asleep, Danny?<br> Not anymore. What's the matter?<br> I'm sorry, but I had to see you.<br> Something wrong? Hand me a cigarette.<br> A cigarette. Over there.<br> Sure.<br> I'm quitting the band, Danny.<br> I'm not going on to 'Frisco in the morning.<br> - You crazy or something?<br> - Maybe. Maybe, but I'm quitting.<br> Why? What happened?<br> Norman Maine is gonna get me<br> a screen test.<br> Go on back to bed, will you, Esther?<br> Well, it's true.<br> You been drinking with him?<br> Of course not.<br> When we get to 'Frisco,<br> I'll take you to a doctor...<br> ...and have your head examined.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> He was making a conventional pass,<br> that's all.<br> No. No, it wasn't that, Danny.<br> What else is it then?<br> He just follows bands around<br> and gives singers screen tests?<br> What's got into you?<br> He gave me a look at myself<br> I've never had before.<br> He saw something in me<br> nobody else ever did.<br> And he made me see it, too.<br> He made me believe it.<br> Believe what? It's taken<br> all these years for you...<br> ...to get with a big-name outfit.<br> You gonna toss it all in the ashcan?<br> And for what?<br> For a chance at being something...<br> ...something bigger than I ever dreamed of.<br> And I'm not gonna turn back now.<br> Ever.<br> Coffee's almost ready.<br> I don't want any coffee.<br> I'm wide awake now.<br> Don't be mad at me.<br> I'll be up in time to see you off<br> in the morning.<br> I guess I'd better go.<br> How much money have you got, Esther?<br> Money?<br> A little.<br> Enough to last for a couple of weeks.<br> You'll be all signed up<br> and in front of the cameras by then.<br> You fool.<br> You fool!<br> You think so?<br> Then why do I feel like this?<br> - Goodbye, honey.<br> - 'Bye.<br> Good luck to you.<br> Wait a minute, Danny.<br> Wish me luck.<br> Luck? You silly...<br> All right, go ahead and say it.<br> No, no use. You're going for the ride.<br> Okay. Good luck.<br> Don't forget who makes<br> better vocal arrangements for you...<br> ...better than anybody else in the world!<br> In his unusual wonderful shape, huh?<br> He'll sleep it off on the plane.<br> Any idea how long you'll be gone?<br> About five or six weeks at least.<br> This one's being shot mostly on location.<br> It's a big sea epic.<br> He won't see anything for a long time<br> but the stuff he hates, water!<br> So long.<br> All right, cut.<br> That's the one. Wrap it up.<br> Bring us in.<br> They got it.<br> Bring him on in here.<br> Bring him straight on in.<br> Very nice.<br> - Thank you. Eddie!<br> - Drink that coffee.<br> - Where's Eddie?<br> - You can talk to Eddie later.<br> There you are, Eddie. Any luck?<br> Did you find it?<br> Mr. Maine, there's about 300 bungalow<br> courts around Sunset and Highland.<br> - Can't you remember the number?<br> - No, just the neighborhood!<br> Go ahead, take that telephone book<br> and ring all 300. Go on!<br> Will you go down and dry off!<br> I need you in the cabin shot.<br> What's with this phone-book routine?<br> The usual, some dame.<br> Eddie! Hey, Eddie!<br> It has the name of a flower on the side.<br> A poinsettia, or zinnia, or something.<br> Get the studio to have someone take a car<br> and cruise around there.<br> For two days if necessary!<br> But find that place.<br> Four days?<br> But you're behind schedule now, Bob.<br> Is Maine drunk?<br> Tell me the truth. Don't cover for him.<br> I want to know.<br> Okay, we'll shoot around him.<br> Try and make up the time<br> as soon as he's up.<br> Cut some corners, Bob.<br> You've got to bring it on time.<br> You know how tough things are right now.<br> They're on my neck from New York<br> every day.<br> Okay, I understand.<br> What's so amusing?<br> Is Maine sick?<br> Bad case of flu. A 103 temperature.<br> Kept him in the water too long, I'll bet.<br> Water would have a bad effect on him.<br> Esther, somebody called you about a job.<br> Said to call them right back.<br> The number's on the phone there.<br> Thanks.<br> Mr. Blake?<br> Yes.<br> Singing?<br> Yes.<br> On the set at 9:00.<br> Thank you very much.<br> "It's very nice<br> "It's a bargain at double the price<br> "Try it and find as long as you live<br> "Your crowning glory will be<br> most attractive<br> "If you want to be a girl<br> that the men run to<br> "Use Trinidad Cocoanut Oil Shampoo<br> "Take my advice<br> "It's a bargain at double the price!"<br> I'm gonna talk quick.<br> We took a five-minute break,<br> I've gotta get back.<br> I squared it with Williams.<br> He'll take you back.<br> I'll wire the dough for the fare...<br> ...and you can join us in Cleveland.<br> Give me that address again.<br> I don't get it.<br> Do you know what the odds are<br> against you?<br> You're wasting your breath.<br> I don't think about him.<br> I forgot him weeks ago.<br> But he did show me the way<br> and that's what I'm sticking to.<br> - I don't care if I have to scrub floors...<br> - Your order's ready. Pick it up.<br> Danny, I've gotta go.<br> All right. Goodbye. Thank you.<br> Good evening.<br> What's good to eat today?<br> Cheeseburgers, nutburgers,<br> banana burgers, chicken burgers...<br> ...lobster burgers, chop-suey burgers and<br> our special, the superduper super burger.<br> What's in that?<br> Everything in the place. All burgered.<br> You haven't the faintest idea<br> where she might have gone from here?<br> I told you, sir. I told you three times.<br> When people can't afford<br> the moderate rates...<br> Yes, yes. Thank you so very much.<br> Oleander Arms!<br> No wonder I couldn't remember the name.<br> Can't you call your place<br> something sensible, like...<br> What?<br> Never mind.<br> I bet you've never seen an oleander<br> in your life.<br> Normie! Pumpkin!<br> Pumpkin, now really!<br> You just can't lie here<br> on a lovely day like this.<br> I can so just lie here<br> on a lovely day like this.<br> What's the matter, Normie,<br> have I offended you?<br> Well, if I have, darling,<br> I'm really terribly sorry.<br> All I did was remember<br> what you promised me.<br> What did I promise you?<br> Was it a blue mink or a white mink?<br> Or have they done something else<br> to those poor minks while I was away?<br> Normie! Darling, it's not presents I want.<br> It's you, Pumpkin, just you.<br> Don't you remember?<br> You said as soon as you finished...<br> ...that nasty old picture<br> we'd go to Honolulu.<br> Now what's the matter?<br> - That singing.<br> - Singing?<br> Yeah, on this television<br> while you were talking.<br> - Singing something.<br> - It was just an old commercial, silly.<br> Normie!<br> For heaven's sake, Norman!<br> Mrs. Barker! Hey, Mrs. Barker!<br> Who do you think just went upstairs?<br> Get away from that car!<br> Get away from that car!<br> Hello.<br> Come on up.<br> All right.<br> I look so terrible.<br> Never mind how you look, listen to me.<br> I got shanghaied away. Location.<br> I tried, believe me, I tried...<br> Get away from that car!<br> I'll beat your brains out when I get down.<br> Get away!<br> This is so awful.<br> You could stand a good dinner.<br> I could, and in a place<br> with tablecloths, too.<br> What about a drive to the beach?<br> We could stop off for a hamburger<br> on the way and then have a late supper.<br> What's the matter? What is it, Esther?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> It's the nose. The nose is the problem.<br> Maybe a corrective in the nostril.<br> No.<br> - Could l...<br> - Please, little lady, Mr. Ettinger is thinking.<br> It's 6:00 in the morning.<br> Just about time for one of his miracles.<br> Do you think, maybe...<br> Do you think<br> maybe the Dietrich eyebrows?<br> No. The nose is still the problem.<br> Suppose we try the Crawford mouth.<br> Take the attention away from the nose.<br> No. No!<br> Do you think maybe a hair job?<br> Yes, I think that would be fine.<br> Mr. Maine.<br> Sorry, I'm late for an appointment.<br> - Catch me in the commissary later.<br> - Mr. Maine.<br> Oh, no!<br> No!<br> What's the matter with it?<br> I don't think that's very nice.<br> Go ahead, laugh your head off.<br> I've been sitting in that chair<br> since 6:00 this morning.<br> You sat an hour too long, honey.<br> Come on.<br> Now, sit down on that chair.<br> Here?<br> Well, first things first.<br> Now, what else is there?<br> Is that you?<br> Off it comes.<br> Now, wait, don't, don't...<br> My nose is very bad.<br> Now, take every bit of that junk<br> off your face.<br> But my eyes are all wrong<br> and my ears are too big and...<br> ...l've got no chin.<br> I know. Take it off and then<br> put on your eyebrows and lipstick...<br> ...the way you always do<br> and I'll do the rest.<br> Come on, you've gotta be made up<br> and ready to shoot that test by 9:00.<br> But, Mr. Maine...<br> I think at this critical moment<br> you might call me Norman.<br> What difference does it make<br> how well I sing if my face is so awful?<br> Your face is just dandy.<br> Now, wipe it off.<br> Once more into the breach, dear friends,<br> once more.<br> Hey, you're shivering.<br> Let me get you something to...<br> Here, put this around you.<br> Norman, I've got the willies.<br> I'm scared stiff.<br> I don't think I could sing a note.<br> Nothing would come out.<br> Of course you're scared. We all are.<br> What makes you think you wouldn't be?<br> Look, forget the camera.<br> It's the Downbeat Club<br> at 3:00 in the morning...<br> ...and you're singing for yourself<br> and for the boys in the band.<br> Mainly for yourself, the way I heard you.<br> Just keep that picture in your mind.<br> And if that doesn't do it,<br> think of a man in a car eating a nutburger.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> - Miss Markham?<br> - Yes?<br> I was told to see you. I'm Esther Blodgett.<br> Oh, yes? I expected a blonde.<br> I don't know why.<br> - You just signed a contract with us?<br> - Yes, I have.<br> Good. Good. Glad to have you with us.<br> We'll have to get what you've done so far.<br> - Where you came from and so forth.<br> - I brought my scrapbook with me.<br> - And I thought that maybe...<br> - Thanks, dear. Very nice.<br> I'll have to turn you over<br> to Miss Fussolow of Fashions.<br> This layout has got to get out<br> to three magazines.<br> - Come along, dear.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Glad to have you with us.<br> - Thank you.<br> Take care of this for me, will you?<br> New contract player. Norman Maine.<br> - Hello, honey, nice to have you with us.<br> - Hello.<br> Soon as I get some background on you,<br> I must do a fashion stuff.<br> - Well, I brought a scrapbook...<br> - Not now, dear.<br> I've gotta get these dresses<br> right down to Photo.<br> Come along, honey.<br> All right.<br> I'll tell you what to do, honey.<br> Why don't you go in and see Mr. Libby?<br> His office is right there.<br> He's the head of the department.<br> - Glad to have you with us.<br> - Thank you.<br> Your hand a little higher. That's good.<br> Get out of the way.<br> Get out of the way.<br> - I'm going to go right away.<br> - Just get out of the way.<br> Leave them alone. They're all right.<br> That's all right. Just get out of the way.<br> Would you lie back?<br> Let's take this picture.<br> Mr. Libby?<br> I'm Esther Blodgett.<br> - Miss Fussolow...<br> - Glad to have you with us.<br> Well, it certainly is a thrill to be here.<br> I brought my scrapbook along in case...<br> Would you care to meet the big boss?<br> It's the usual procedure.<br> - I'll take you over to him.<br> - Fine.<br> May be the only chance you'll get<br> to meet him.<br> - What's the matter? You afraid of heights?<br> - No, no!<br> Mr. Niles.<br> Libby?<br> - We're running a picture.<br> - You should meet this lady.<br> She just signed her contract.<br> The one Mr. Maine arranged the test for.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> Nice to see you, dear.<br> Glad to have you with us.<br> Well, it's a thrill to be here.<br> Show Miss... how to get out of here.<br> Good luck to you, dear.<br> Take care of yourself.<br> - Mr. Libby.<br> - What?<br> - What do I do next?<br> - Well, the gate's right down there.<br> - What did you say your name was again?<br> - Esther Blodgett.<br> - What?<br> - Esther Blodgett.<br> We'll have to do something about that<br> right away. Don't worry about it.<br> We'll have a new name for you<br> by the end of the week.<br> Paul, will you swing your arc<br> over here, please?<br> That's good. Hold it.<br> Can you make it?<br> All ready, sir.<br> - Get the girl.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Oh, Esther.<br> Pull that one down a couple of turns.<br> Esther. Waiting for you on the set.<br> Okay, boys, let's go. Everybody works.<br> Right up there.<br> Stand by, everybody.<br> All right, sir.<br> You know what I want, Esther?<br> Put your arm out the window like this<br> and you wave goodbye.<br> It's farewell, so give it<br> everything you've got.<br> Okay, get over there.<br> Let's take a try at it.<br> Here we go! Hit your lights.<br> Hit your wind.<br> Hit your snow.<br> Hit your steam.<br> Roll them.<br> Speed.<br> Action.<br> We're getting her face.<br> Cut.<br> - We saw her face.<br> - We saw your face.<br> - We saw her face.<br> - We saw your face.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Watch it, Esther.<br> Let's try it again.<br> Watch it next time.<br> Now, be careful this time.<br> Just use the arm and the hand.<br> I don't want to see your face.<br> Let's try it again.<br> Hit everything.<br> Come on.<br> - Speed.<br> - Action!<br> Esther Blodgett, please.<br> Go to L.<br> What?<br> Go to L.<br> Go to window marked L.<br> You're listed under L.<br> Thank you.<br> Esther Blodgett, please.<br> - You new here?<br> - Yes.<br> Just a moment. Okay.<br> Your name is Vicki Lester.<br> - What?<br> - Your name is Vicki Lester.<br> Vicki Lester. V-i-c-k-i L-e-s-t-e-r. Get it?<br> Move on, please.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Vicki Lester?<br> Vicki Lester?<br> Vicki Lester.<br> Why couldn't you come over to my office<br> to see me, Norman?<br> What's so hush-hush that you have<br> to drag me down here?<br> Every time I lie down on this sofa,<br> I get stabbed in the back.<br> What do you want?<br> That's what I want to talk to you about.<br> Come here.<br> Sit down in that chair.<br> The whole place gives me the creeps.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Hasn't been decorated in centuries.<br> Isn't that the most uncomfortable chair?<br> Don't I deserve a dressing room<br> that's cheerful, modern and safe?<br> You got me down here for this?<br> When I give an interview here<br> I'm ashamed.<br> I have the whole studio sitting on me,<br> and you get me down here for this?<br> Aren't you ashamed? Don't you realize<br> I have a production shut down...<br> ...right in the middle of shooting?<br> That's what you got me away from.<br> I'm being stabbed by a singer in New York.<br> You had to stop shooting<br> 'cause you didn't get her here.<br> What will you do?<br> I don't know. I don't know what I'll do<br> except go crazy.<br> That woman, she swore<br> her contract was up with the show.<br> Our lawyers are talking about it<br> to New York this afternoon.<br> Why do they play that stuff so loud?<br> You better leave it open,<br> we'll be suffocated.<br> What is it, anyway?<br> It's just somebody running some tests.<br> I can hardly hear myself think.<br> I suppose there's nobody around here?<br> What?<br> You'd think there'd be someone here<br> you could take a chance on...<br> ...rather than close down an entire picture.<br> Who, for instance? Name someone.<br> I don't know, Oliver.<br> You actors.<br> You think all there is to running a studio<br> is pressing buttons.<br> It's not quite that easy, believe me.<br> Say, who is that singing, anyway?<br> It must be one of the contract girls.<br> Not bad.<br> No.<br> Not bad.<br> Not bad at all.<br> A light begins to break. Very dumb of me.<br> All right, I get it.<br> A little late, that's all.<br> Is she still around?<br> Indeed. Indeed.<br> Very good. That's fine, Esther.<br> Just right down here...<br> I shouldn't go that far.<br> Now, let's all do it again.<br> I've been through this a hundred times,<br> Esther.<br> My own previews<br> as well as other people's.<br> The thing to remember about a preview...<br> ...is first and foremost<br> pay absolutely no attention...<br> ...to the sights and sounds going on<br> around you.<br> If the picture before the preview is<br> a stinker, then your picture...<br> ...gets off to a good start. Anyway,<br> they always go out for fresh popcorn...<br> ...so that the first few reels always sound<br> like the Marines landing on lwo Jima.<br> And the thing to do...<br> Yes?<br> Would you stop the car, please?<br> Are you all right?<br> Fine. I wish I was dead.<br> Come on.<br> We're in luck, Esther.<br> - Why? Did the theater burn down?<br> - No.<br> But that picture of mine is so bad that<br> anything they see after it will seem great.<br> You're starting lucky.<br> "Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya<br> "My dear old Swanee<br> "The folks up North will see me no more<br> "When I get to that Swanee shore"<br> Thank you, thank you very much.<br> I can't express any other way.<br> For with this awful trembling in my heart...<br> ...I just can't find another thing to say.<br> I'm happy that you like the show.<br> I'm grateful you liked me.<br> And I'm sure to you the tribute seemed<br> quite right.<br> "But if you knew of all the years<br> "Of hopes and dreams and tears<br> "You'd know it didn't happen overnight"<br> Overnight.<br> "I was born in a trunk<br> "In the Princess Theater<br> "In Pocatello, Idaho<br> "It was during a matinee on Friday<br> "And they used a makeup towel<br> for my didy<br> "When I first saw the light<br> "It was pink and amber<br> "Coming from the footlights on the stage<br> "When my dad carried me out there<br> to say hello<br> "They tell me that I stopped the show<br> "So I grew up in a crazy world<br> "Of dressing rooms and hotel rooms<br> and waiting rooms<br> "And rooms behind the scenes<br> "And I can't forget the endless rows<br> "Of sleepless nights and 'eatless' nights<br> "And nights without a nickel in my jeans<br> "But it's all in the game<br> "And the way you play it<br> "And you've gotta play the game you know<br> "When you're born in a trunk<br> "In the Princess Theater<br> "In Pocatello, Idaho<br> "At first I just stood and watched<br> from the wings<br> "That's all my mom and dad would allow<br> "But as I got older, I got a little bolder<br> "And snuck out for their second bow<br> "They kept me in the act<br> because they needed me to milk applause<br> "Until one night they did a crazy thing<br> "They left me out there all alone<br> and Mama said, 'You're on your own'<br> "And Poppa shouted, 'This is it, kid, sing'<br> "I'll get by<br> "As long as I have you<br> "Though there be rain<br> "And darkness, too<br> "I'll not complain<br> "I'll see it through"<br> "I learned very quickly<br> the tricks of the trade<br> "I practiced after everyone was gone<br> "And with the tricks I learned traditions<br> "And the hardest one of all<br> "Is no matter what<br> "The show must go on<br> "As time went by I looked for jobs<br> "And was kicked from pillar to post<br> "I haunted all the agents' offices<br> "And I almost ended up a ghost"<br> "I'm a sentimental sap, that's all<br> "What's the use of trying not to fall<br> "I have no will<br> You made your kill<br> "Cause you took advantage of me"<br> No!<br> "I'm just like an apple on a bough<br> "And you're gonna shake me down<br> somehow<br> "So what's the use?<br> You've cooked my goose<br> "'Cause you took advantage of me"<br> No!<br> "I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know<br> my elbow from my ear<br> "Suffer something awful each time you go<br> but much worse when you're near<br> "Here am I with all my bridges burned<br> "Just a babe in arms<br> where you're concerned<br> "So lock the doors<br> Call me yours<br> "'Cause you took advantage of me"<br> Yes.<br> No!<br> "So I got into a tab show<br> "All I did was kick my feet<br> "You'd hardly call it a chance to sing<br> "But at least it was a chance to eat"<br> "They call it black bottom, a new twister<br> "It's sure got them and, oh, sister<br> "They clap their hands<br> and do a raggedy trot<br> "Hot!<br> "Old fellows with lumbago<br> and young fellows away they go<br> "They jump right in<br> and give it all that they've got"<br> Then one night something happened.<br> Dame Fortune showed her face.<br> The star got sick and I was told to go on<br> in her place.<br> But she recovered.<br> Oh, well.<br> "Black bottom, a new rhythm<br> "When you spot them, you go with them<br> "That do that black, black, black bottom<br> "You won't be blue<br> when you have got them<br> "If you do that black, black, black,<br> black bottom all day<br> "But finally I got an offer to sing<br> in New York<br> "And I wired, 'I'm on my way,'<br> "I had visions that this would be<br> "A fabulous, famous caf<br> "Filled with high society<br> "Elegant and spruce<br> "And I pictured me<br> "The epitome of a very chic chanteuse<br> "Peanuts<br> "Through every city,<br> town and

That's not what you're getting<br> from me, baby.<br> You don't deserve it.<br> You're a great monument<br> to Norman Maine, you are.<br> He was a drunk and he wasted his life,<br> but he loved you.<br> And he took enormous pride in the one<br> thing in his life that wasn't a waste, you.<br> His love for you and your success.<br> That was the one thing in his life<br> that wasn't a waste. And he knew it.<br> Maybe he was wrong to do what he did,<br> I don't know.<br> But he didn't want to destroy that,<br> destroy the only thing he took pride in.<br> And now you are doing the one thing<br> he was terrified of, you're wiping it out!<br> You're tossing aside the one thing<br> he had left.<br> You're tossing it right back into the ocean<br> after him!<br> You're the only thing that remains<br> of him now.<br> And if you just kick it away,<br> it's like he never existed...<br> ...like there never was a Norman Maine<br> at all.<br> Will you wait for me?<br> - Vicki! How are you?<br> - How are you? It's good to see you.<br> - It's been so long. You look wonderful.<br> - Thank you.<br> She looks great, doesn't she? You, too.<br> We gotta go now.<br> The next star listed to appear<br> on your program is Vicki Lester.<br> But we're all of us aware of<br> the tragic circumstances which prevent...<br> ... Vicki Lester's appearance here tonight.<br> It's with the deepest sympathy...<br> Will you forgive me for a moment?<br> Vicki Lester will appear tonight!<br> Here she is, ladies and gentlemen,<br> a star that shines bright and high.<br> As you know this program is being<br> broadcast all over the world.<br> Before you sing for us, I know<br> that your millions of fans everywhere...<br> ... are hoping you'll say a few words<br> to them.<br> Won't you?<br> Hello, everybody.<br> This is Mrs. Norman Maine.<br> "You brought a new world to me<br> "And that it'll always, always be"<br>
