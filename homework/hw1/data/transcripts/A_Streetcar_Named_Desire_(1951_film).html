                        Can I help you?<br> They told me to take a<br> streetcar named Desire...<br> ...then transfer to one<br> called Cemeteries...<br> ...ride 6 blocks and get<br> off at Elysian Fields.<br> There's your car.<br> Thanks.<br> When he got home, she was waiting.<br> You never heard nothing...<br> What's wrong? You lost?<br> I'm looking for Elysian Fields.<br> This is Elysian Fields. What number?<br> Don't need to look no further.<br> I'm looking for my sister, Stella<br> DuBois, I mean, Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.<br> That's the party, all right.<br> You just did miss her, though.<br> This...<br> Can this be her home?<br> She lives downstairs, I live up.<br> She's out?<br> You notice the bowling alley?<br> - I'm not sure I did.<br> - That's where she's at.<br> She's watching Stanley bowl.<br> Blanche!<br> Stella!<br> Oh, Stella for a star!<br> My darling. Now, then,<br> let me look at you.<br> But don't look at me. I won't<br> be looked at in this glare.<br> - Did you find our place?<br> - What're you doing in a place like that?<br> Never, never in my worst<br> dreams did I picture...<br> Only Poe, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,<br> could do justice to it!<br> What are you doing in that horrible<br> place? I didn't mean to say that.<br> I meant to be nice and say,<br> "What a convenient location!"<br> - You haven't said a word to me.<br> - I haven't had a chance.<br> Now open your pretty mouth and talk.<br> - Come say hello to Stanley first.<br> - No, not now.<br> Just say hello.<br> Which is he? Which one is he?<br> Is he the one...<br> The one making all the rhubarb!<br> Isn't he wonderful-Iooking?<br> I can't meet him now.<br> Not till I've bathed and rested.<br> - Would you like a cold drink?<br> - Bless that lovely inspiration.<br> Oh, baby.<br> Would you like some pop?<br> Honey! Pop!<br> Not with my nerves tonight.<br> A scotch please.<br> Grape.<br> You haven't asked me how I happened<br> to get away from school...<br> ...before the term ended.<br> Thought you'd tell me if you wanted to.<br> You thought I'd been fired?<br> No! I thought you might have resigned.<br> I was so exhausted by all I'd<br> been through, my nerves broke.<br> I was on the verge of lunacy, almost.<br> So Mr. Graves... He's the<br> high school superintendent...<br> Thank you. He suggested...<br> ...I take a leave of absence.<br> I couldn't put all those details<br> into the wire. This feels so good.<br> Like another?<br> One's my limit. You haven't<br> said a word about my appearance.<br> You look fine.<br> God love you for a liar.<br> Daylight never exposed so total a ruin.<br> But you've put on some weight.<br> You're as plump as a partridge.<br> It's so becoming to you.<br> Yes, it is! Or I wouldn't say it!<br> You just have to watch<br> around the hips a little.<br> I wanted you to look at my figure.<br> I haven't put on one ounce in 10 years.<br> I weigh now what I weighed the<br> summer you left Belle Reve...<br> ...the summer Dad died and you left us.<br> It's just incredible,<br> Blanche, how well you look.<br> Sure you don't want another?<br> Maybe I will take just<br> one tiny nip more...<br> ...to put the stopper on.<br> Don't worry, your sister's not a drunk.<br> She's just all shaken up<br> and hot and dirty and tired.<br> Waiter!<br> Waiter!<br> You want it hot?<br> Scalding.<br> What is it?<br> There's only two rooms.<br> Where will you put me?<br> We'll put you right here.<br> What kind of a bed's this?<br> One of those collapsible things?<br> You all right?<br> Wonderful, honey. I don't<br> like a bed that gives much.<br> There's no door between the two rooms.<br> Will it be decent?<br> Stanley's Polish, you know.<br> Something like Irish, isn't it?<br> Well...<br> I bought some nice clothes to<br> meet all your lovely friends in.<br> Well, I'm afraid you won't<br> think they're lovely.<br> I bought nice clothes<br> and I'll wear them.<br> I guess you're hoping I'll<br> say I'll put up at a hotel.<br> But I'm not going to.<br> I must be near you. I must be<br> with people. I can't be alone...<br> ...because, as you must have noticed...<br> ...I'm not very well.<br> You do seem...<br> Will Stanley like me or will<br> I just be a visiting in-law?<br> I couldn't stand that.<br> You'll get along fine.<br> Try not to compare him...<br> He was an officer?<br> He was a master sergeant,<br> decorated 4 times.<br> - He had those on when you met him?<br> - I wasn't just blinded by the brass.<br> I wasn't...<br> There were things to<br> adjust myself to later on.<br> Such as his... civilian background?<br> How'd he take the news I was coming?<br> - He's on the road a good deal.<br> - Oh, he travels?<br> Good. I mean, isn't it?<br> I can hardly stand it when<br> he's away for a night.<br> - Lf he's away for a week, I go wild.<br> - Gracious!<br> When he comes back, cry<br> on his lap like a baby.<br> I guess that's what's<br> meant by being in love.<br> I haven't asked the things you<br> probably thought I would...<br> ...so I expect you to be understanding<br> about what I have to tell you.<br> What?<br> You're going to reproach me. I know<br> you're bound to, but before you do...<br> ...consider the fact that you left.<br> I stayed and struggled.<br> You came to New Orleans. I stayed at<br> Belle Reve trying to hold it together.<br> I'm not meaning to reproach you...<br> ...but all the burden descended on me!<br> It was best I came here.<br> But you abandoned Belle Reve, not I.<br> I stayed and almost died for it!<br> - Tell me what happened!<br> - I knew you'd take this attitude!<br> About what? Please!<br> The loss.<br> The loss.<br> Belle Reve? Lost, is it?<br> Yes.<br> But how did it go? What happened?<br> You're a fine one to ask me how it went!<br> To stand there accusing me of it!<br> I won't stand it!<br> I! I took the blows on<br> my face and my body!<br> All of those deaths!<br> The long parade to the graveyard.<br> Father, Mother...<br> ...Margaret, that dreadful way.<br> You just came home for the funerals.<br> And funerals are pretty<br> compared to deaths.<br> How'd you think all that<br> dying was paid for?<br> Death is expensive, Miss Stella.<br> And l, from my pitiful<br> salary at the school.<br> Yes, accuse me.<br> Stare at me, thinking<br> I let the place go!<br> I let the place go! Where were you?<br> In there with your Polack!<br> That's enough!<br> Oh, Stella, Stella, you're crying!<br> Does that surprise you?<br> We playing at your house?<br> No, my mother's still sick.<br> - You bring the beer.<br> - Break it up down there.<br> - I made spaghetti and ate it myself!<br> - Now, honey...<br> ...told you we were playing.<br> You never phoned me once.<br> - I told you at breakfast.<br> - Why don't you just get in here.<br> Do you want it in the newspapers?<br> You must be Stanley.<br> I'm Blanche.<br> You're Stel's sister.<br> Yes.<br> Hi ya.<br> Where's the little woman?<br> In the bathroom.<br> Where you from, Blanche?<br> I live in Auriol.<br> Auriol.<br> Oh, yeah, that's right.<br> Auriol, that's not my territory.<br> Liquor goes fast in the hot weather.<br> Want a shot?<br> No, I rarely touch it.<br> There's some people that rarely<br> touch it, but it touches them often.<br> You mind if I make myself comfortable?<br> Please do.<br> " Be comfortable," that's my motto.<br> Mine too. It's hard to stay<br> looking fresh in hot weather.<br> I haven't washed or even powdered and...<br> ...here you are.<br> You must be careful sitting<br> in damp things. Catch cold.<br> Especially when you been<br> exercising hard, like bowling.<br> What do you do? You're a teacher?<br> Yes.<br> What subject?<br> English.<br> I never was a very good English student.<br> - How long you here for?<br> - I don't know yet.<br> Shacking up here?<br> I will if it's not inconvenient for you.<br> Good.<br> Traveling wears me out.<br> Take it easy.<br> What's that?<br> Those cats.<br> What'd you do, fall asleep in there?<br> I guess I'll strike you as<br> being the unrefined type.<br> Stella's spoke a good deal about you.<br> She said you were married once.<br> Said you were married once.<br> Said you were married once.<br> Yes.<br> When I was quite young.<br> What happened?<br> What happened?<br> The boy...<br> The boy died.<br> I'm afraid...<br> ...I'm going to be sick.<br> Fresh fish!<br> Fish!<br> Fresh fish!<br> Looks like she's fixing to stay awhile.<br> So, we playing tonight?<br> Maybe we ought to...<br> Don't figure no maybes.<br> - Put it down.<br> - Right.<br> Shall I get the other one?<br> Thanks, darling.<br> Is Stanley back with my trunk?<br> Yes.<br> Honey? Will you get my blue net for me?<br> All right.<br> It was good of Stanley to get my trunk.<br> He was glad to do it.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - Just don't forget.<br> I'm taking Blanche to Galatoire's<br> for supper, then to a show...<br> ...because it's poker night.<br> How about my supper?<br> I'm not going to Galatoire's.<br> I put you a cold plate on ice.<br> We'll be back after the party's over<br> as I'm not sure how'll she'll take it.<br> Isn't that just dandy.<br> You better give me some money.<br> Where is she?<br> She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet<br> her nerves. She's terribly upset.<br> Over what?<br> She's been through an ordeal.<br> We lost Belle Reve.<br> What, the place in the country?<br> How?<br> It had to be sacrificed.<br> When she comes in, say something<br> nice about her appearance.<br> And...<br> ...don't mention the baby.<br> I haven't told her.<br> I'm waiting till she calms down.<br> And try to understand her<br> and be nice to her, honey.<br> She wasn't expecting such a place.<br> I tried to gloss things over<br> a little in my letters.<br> Admire her dress.<br> Tell her she looks wonderful.<br> It's important to Blanche,<br> her little weakness.<br> Okay, I get the idea, but...<br> ...let's just skip back to where<br> you said the place was disposed of.<br> How about a few more<br> details on that subject.<br> It's best not to talk about<br> it until she's calmed down.<br> Is that the deal? Blanche can't<br> be annoyed with details right now?<br> You saw how she was last night.<br> I saw how she was. Now,<br> let's see the bill of sale.<br> I haven't seen any.<br> She didn't show you no papers,<br> no deed nor nothing?<br> It seemed like it wasn't sold.<br> Was it given away to charity?<br> - She'll hear you.<br> - I don't care. Let's see the papers.<br> There weren't any. She didn't show<br> any papers. I don't care about papers.<br> Wait, listen. Have you<br> heard of the Napoleonic code?<br> No, I haven't heard of<br> the Napoleonic code.<br> Let me enlighten you on a point or two.<br> We got here in Louisiana what's<br> known as the Napoleonic Code:<br> That what belongs to the wife, belongs<br> to the husband, and vice versa.<br> Will you listen?<br> For example, if I had that property...<br> My head is swimming.<br> Well, all right, then.<br> When she's done soaking in the tub...<br> ...I'll inquire if she<br> is acquainted with it.<br> Stanley! Don't be so silly!<br> It looks like you were swindled.<br> And, under the Napoleonic Code, I<br> got swindled too. I don't like that.<br> You've no idea how<br> ridiculous you're being...<br> ...when you suggest my sister, or...<br> ...anyone else of our family,<br> could have swindled anyone...<br> Come on, where's the money<br> if the place was sold?<br> Not sold! Lost! Lost!<br> Come here.<br> Open your eyes to this stuff here?<br> She got this out of a teacher's pay?<br> Oh, hush!<br> Look at these fine feathers and<br> furs that she preens herself in.<br> What is this article?<br> A solid-gold dress!<br> And this one here.<br> And what is that, a fox-piece?<br> A genuine fur-fox, a half a mile long!<br> Where are your fox-pieces?<br> Bushy, snow-white ones, no less!<br> Where are your white fox furs?<br> Those are inexpensive furs<br> Blanche has had a long time.<br> An acquaintance deals in these items<br> and he's going to appraise this.<br> Don't be an idiot!<br> I'll bet you there's $1000 invested in this stuff.<br> Now, is that the treasure<br> chest of a pirate?<br> That's pearls. Ropes of them.<br> Is your sister a deep-sea diver?<br> Where're your pearls and gold bracelets?<br> Be still.<br> A diamond crown for an empress.<br> A rhinestone tiara she<br> wore to a costume ball.<br> What is rhinestone?<br> Next door to glass.<br> An acquaintance works in a jewelry store.<br> He'll come to make an appraisal.<br> Here's your plantation.<br> You're being stupid and horrid!<br> You stay away from these<br> things before she comes out!<br> The Kowalskis and DuBois got<br> a different notion on this.<br> Indeed they have, thank heavens.<br> I'm going outside.<br> Go ahead.<br> Come out with me while<br> Blanche is getting dressed.<br> Since when are you giving me orders?<br> Are you going to stay<br> here and insult her?<br> You bet your life I'm staying.<br> Hello, Stanley.<br> Here I am, freshly bathed and scented<br> and feeling like a new person.<br> That's good.<br> Will you excuse me while I<br> put on my pretty new dress?<br> Go ahead.<br> I understand there's to be<br> a card party here tonight...<br> ...to which we ladies are<br> cordially not invited.<br> That's right.<br> Where is Stella?<br> She's out on the porch.<br> I'm going to ask a favor of you soon.<br> What's that going to be, I wonder?<br> Some buttons in back.<br> You may enter.<br> How do I look?<br> You look okay.<br> Many thanks. Now, the buttons.<br> I can't do no more with them.<br> You men with your big, clumsy fingers.<br> May I have a drag?<br> - Have one for yourself.<br> - Thank you.<br> It looks like my trunk has exploded.<br> Me and Stella helped you unpack.<br> You did a fast and thorough job of it.<br> It looks like you've raided<br> some stylish shops in Paris.<br> Clothes are my passion.<br> How much do furs like that cost?<br> These were a tribute from an admirer.<br> He had a lot of admiration.<br> In my youth I excited some<br> admiration, but look at me now.<br> Will you think it's possible that<br> I was once considered attractive?<br> Your looks are okay.<br> - I was fishing for a compliment.<br> - I don't go in for that.<br> - What?<br> - Compliments to women on their looks.<br> Every dame knows if she's good<br> looking without being told.<br> Some give themselves credit<br> for more than they've got.<br> I once went out with a dame who<br> said, "I'm the glamorous type."<br> She says, "I'm the glamorous type."<br> I says, "So what?"<br> What did she say then?<br> Nothing. It shut her up.<br> Did it end the romance?<br> It ended the conversation.<br> That was all.<br> Some men are took in by this Hollywood<br> glamour stuff, and some men just aren't.<br> - And you're in the 2nd category.<br> - That's right.<br> - I can't imagine a woman bewitching you.<br> - That's right.<br> You're simple, straightforward<br> and honest. A bit on the...<br> ...primitive side. To interest<br> you a woman would have to...<br> She must lay the cards on the table.<br> I never did care for wishy-washy people.<br> When I saw you last<br> night I said to myself:<br> "My sister has married a man."<br> That was all I could tell...<br> How about cutting the re-bop?!<br> Come with me while Blanche dresses.<br> - I'm done.<br> - Come out.<br> - Your sister and I are chatting.<br> - Do me a favor.<br> Go to the store and get me a<br> lemon coke with chipped ice.<br> Will you do that for me, sweetie?<br> Please?<br> All right.<br> The poor thing was listening to us.<br> I have an idea she doesn't<br> understand you as well as I do.<br> All right, let us proceed<br> without any more digression.<br> I'm ready to answer all questions.<br> I've nothing to hide. What is it?<br> In the state of Louisiana we've got<br> what's known as the Napoleonic Code.<br> According to which that what belongs<br> to the wife belongs to her husband.<br> You have an impressive judicial air.<br> If you weren't my wife's sister,<br> I'd get ideas about you.<br> Such as what?<br> Don't play so dumb. You know what.<br> All right.<br> Cards on the table.<br> I know I fib a good deal.<br> But a woman's charm is 50% illusion.<br> But when a thing is important,<br> I tell the truth.<br> This is the truth:<br> I never cheated my sister...<br> ...or you, or anyone else on<br> earth as long as I lived!<br> Where are the papers?<br> Everything I own is in that trunk.<br> What are you thinking? What's in<br> that little boy's mind of yours?<br> I'll do it, it'll be faster and simpler.<br> I keep my papers in this tin box.<br> What are those underneath?<br> Some love letters...<br> ...yellowing with antiquity.<br> - All from one boy. Give them to me!<br> - I'll just look.<br> - Your touch insults them.<br> - Don't pull that stuff!<br> Now that you've touched<br> them, I'll burn them!<br> What are they?<br> Poems... the dead boy wrote.<br> I hurt him the way that you would<br> like to hurt me, but you can't.<br> I'm no longer young and vulnerable.<br> My young husband was and I...<br> Never mind about that.<br> Give them back to me.<br> What'd you mean, you have to burn them?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I must have lost my head for a moment.<br> Everyone has something they<br> won't let others touch...<br> ...because of their intimate nature.<br> Ambler and Ambler!<br> Crabtree!<br> Ambler and Ambler!<br> - What's Ambler and Ambler?<br> - A firm that made loans on the place.<br> - It was lost on a mortgage?<br> - It must have been.<br> I don't want no ifs, ands, or buts!<br> Where's the rest?<br> Thousands of papers, stretching back<br> over centuries, affect Belle Reve.<br> As piece by piece our improvident<br> grandfathers exchanged the land...<br> ...for their epic debauches,<br> to put it mildly.<br> Finally all that was left,<br> and Stella can verify it...<br> ...was the house itself, and 20 acres<br> of ground including a graveyard...<br> ...to which now all but<br> Stella and I have retreated.<br> Here they are, all of them.<br> All papers.<br> I hereby endow you with them.<br> Peruse them, commit them to memory.<br> It's wonderfully fitting<br> that Belle Reve...<br> ...should be this bunch of<br> papers in big, capable hands.<br> I wonder if Stella's back with my coke?<br> I got a lawyer acquaintance,<br> we'll straighten this out.<br> Present them to him with<br> a box of aspirin tablets.<br> Under the Napoleonic Code...<br> ...a man has to take an<br> interest in his wife's affairs.<br> Especially now that she's having a baby.<br> Stella's having a baby?<br> I didn't know she was having a baby.<br> Oh, Stella for a star!<br> How lovely to have a baby!<br> Everything's all right.<br> We thrashed it out. I feel shaky,<br> but I handled it nicely.<br> I treated it as a joke. Laughed,<br> called him a boy and flirted.<br> Yes, I was flirting with your husband.<br> The guests are arriving for the party.<br> I'm sorry he did that to you.<br> I guess he's just not the type<br> that goes for jasmine perfume.<br> Maybe he's what we need to mix with<br> our blood since we've lost Belle Reve...<br> ...and have to go on without<br> Belle Reve to protect us.<br> How pretty the sky is!<br> I ought to go there on a<br> rocket that never comes down.<br> Which way do we go now?<br> This way?<br> No, honey, this way.<br> The blind are leading the blind.<br> Red hots!<br> Go upstairs and tell her to stop that.<br> If I go up, I won't come down.<br> Forget it.<br> Remember when she poured boiling<br> water through the floor cracks?<br> - I gotta go home soon.<br> - What do you say?<br> - No, I'm out.<br> - Every time you win a pot you're out!<br> My mother doesn't sleep<br> until I come home.<br> What do you say?<br> I'm going to wash up.<br> You tell them guys the<br> kettle's on the stove!<br> I'm going to break up the game.<br> Wait.<br> Let me powder. I feel hot and<br> frazzled. Do I look done-in?<br> You look fresh as a daisy.<br> One that's been picked a few days.<br> Why don't somebody go to the<br> Chinaman's and bring back chop suey?<br> - When I'm losing, you want to eat.<br> - I see you are still at it.<br> - Where've you been?<br> - We went to a show.<br> This is Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Hubbell.<br> Hello. Please, don't get up.<br> No one's getting up, don't worry.<br> Poker's fascinating. Could I kibitz?<br> You could not!<br> Why don't you go up to Eunice's?<br> - How long will you play?<br> - Till we're ready to quit!<br> - Wish you'd quit after the next hand.<br> Hey, that's my coat!<br> That's not fun, Stanley.<br> Makes me mad when he does<br> that in front of people.<br> - I think I will bathe.<br> - Again?<br> My nerves are in knots. Is it occupied?<br> I don't know.<br> Good evening.<br> Hello.<br> This is Harold Mitchell.<br> This is my sister, Blanche DuBois.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do, Miss DuBois?<br> How's your mother?<br> She's about the same, thanks.<br> She appreciated that custard.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> Excuse me.<br> - That one seems superior to the others.<br> - Does he?<br> He had a sort of sensitive look.<br> His mother's sick.<br> Is he married?<br> Is he a wolf?<br> Why, Blanche!<br> - No, I don't think he would be.<br> - What does he do?<br> He's on the precision bench in<br> the spare parts department...<br> ...the plant Stanley travels for.<br> Is that something much?<br> Stanley's the only one<br> likely to get anywhere.<br> Flush, win!<br> Blanche, you're standing in the light!<br> Am I? Gracious!<br> You should see their wives!<br> I can imagine. Big,<br> beefy things, I suppose.<br> You know that one upstairs?<br> Hey, you hens! Cut out<br> that cackling in there!<br> You can't hear us!<br> You can hear me and I said, hush up!<br> This is my house and I'll<br> talk as much as I want to!<br> Don't start a row.<br> He's half-drunk.<br> I'll be out in a minute.<br> 50 cents.<br> All right. See you.<br> Well, Steve?<br> I'm out.<br> Two bucks.<br> What do you say?<br> Come on, are you in?<br> I'm out!<br> Who turned that on in there?<br> I did. Do you mind?<br> - Turn it off!<br> - Let the girls have music.<br> Sounds good.<br> There you are!<br> - I didn't hear you name it!<br> - Didn't I name it?<br> - I wasn't listening.<br> - What were you doing?<br> - Looking through the drapes.<br> - I wasn't.<br> We're dealing this hand over again.<br> Play cards, or quit.<br> Deal me out!<br> This game'll be Spit in the Ocean.<br> Hello.<br> Excuse me.<br> The little boy's room<br> is occupied right now.<br> Excuse me.<br> Have you got any cigs?<br> Sure.<br> What a pretty case.<br> Silver?<br> - Yes. Read the inscription.<br> - There is an inscription.<br> Why, I can't make it out.<br> "And if God choose...<br> ...I shall but love thee<br> better after death."<br> That's from my favorite<br> sonnet by Mrs. Browning.<br> - You know it!<br> - Certainly.<br> There's a story connected<br> with this inscription.<br> A romance?<br> A sad one. The girl's dead now.<br> She knew she was dying when she<br> give me this. Strange, sweet girl.<br> She must have been very fond of you.<br> Sick people have deep,<br> sincere attachments.<br> They do.<br> - Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.<br> - It brings it out.<br> The little there is belongs to<br> people who have known sorrow.<br> - I believe you're right.<br> - I'm positive.<br> Deal me out. I'm talking to Miss...<br> DuBois.<br> It's a French name, meaning, "woods."<br> And Blanche means "white." So the<br> two together mean, "white woods."<br> Like an orchard in spring.<br> You can remember it by that...<br> ...if you care to.<br> You are Stella's sister, are you not?<br> Stella's my precious little sister.<br> I call her "little" though<br> she's older than I am.<br> Just slightly. Less than a year.<br> - Will you do something for me?<br> - Yes. What?<br> I bought this adorable paper<br> lantern at a Chinese shop.<br> Put it over the light bulb, will you?<br> I'd be glad to.<br> I can't stand a naked light bulb<br> anymore than I can a rude remark...<br> ...or a vulgar action.<br> I guess we strike you as<br> being a pretty rough bunch.<br> I'm very adaptable...<br> ...to circumstances.<br> - That's a good way to be.<br> - You're not...<br> - Married? Oh, no, no!<br> I'm an old-maid teacher.<br> You may be a teacher, but you're<br> certainly not an old maid.<br> Why, thank you, sir.<br> I appreciate your gallantry.<br> So you're in the teaching profession?<br> Grade school or high school?<br> Coming!<br> Gracious, what lung power!<br> I teach high school in Auriol.<br> What subject do you teach?<br> Guess.<br> I bet you teach art or music.<br> Of course, I could be wrong.<br> You might teach math.<br> Never math, sir. Never math.<br> I have the misfortune of<br> being an English instructor.<br> I try to instill a bunch of bobby-<br> soxers and drugstore Romeos...<br> ...with a reverence for<br> Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.<br> I bet they are more<br> interested in other things.<br> How very right you are.<br> Their literary heritage is not<br> what they treasure above all.<br> But they're sweet things.<br> In spring, it's touching to see them<br> making their first discovery of love.<br> As if nobody had ever known it...<br> ...before.<br> Sorry.<br> Excuse me!<br> Have you finished?<br> Oh, yes.<br> - I have.<br> - Wait. I'll turn on the radio.<br> Turn on the light now.<br> Oh, look!<br> We've made enchantment.<br> 3 bullets, moustache!<br> Straight! I got you!<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Let me alone!<br> Drunk! You animal thing!<br> Get out!<br> Get out!<br> - What're you doing?<br> - Get out.<br> My sister's going to have a baby!<br> Lunacy! Complete lunacy!<br> You come up to my place.<br> Did he hurt you?<br> - Make him go away!<br> - Poker shouldn't be played around women.<br> Take it easy, will you?<br> Get him in that shower!<br> Come on.<br> Get his feet, will you?<br> Grab his feet. Come on.<br> Come on, get under there. Stay.<br> Get under there.<br> Get him a little higher, that's right.<br> - How you feel?<br> - There you are.<br> Wake up.<br> We should remove his clothes.<br> What're you doing?!<br> Poker should not be played<br> around women!<br> Where's Steve?<br> Take it easy!<br> Honey?<br> Where are you?<br> Hey, baby!<br> You can sleep over here.<br> Blanche can have Steve's place.<br> He ain't coming home if he<br> knows what's good for him.<br> Look! She ain't coming down and she<br> ain't going to talk to you neither.<br> Stop hollering and go to bed.<br> I want my girl.<br> Shut up, or you'll get the law on you.<br> You can't beat up a woman then<br> call her back. She ain't coming.<br> - They'll haul you in like last time!<br> - I want my girl down here.<br> You stinker!<br> I wouldn't mix in this!<br> Please, don't ever leave me, baby.<br> Come back!<br> Miss DuBois?<br> All quiet along the Potomac now?<br> She ran down and went back in with him.<br> - Sure, she did.<br> - I'm terrified.<br> Don't be. They're<br> crazy about each other.<br> - Shame it happened your first day.<br> - Violence is so...<br> Sit down and have a cigarette with me.<br> Why, I'm not properly dressed.<br> That doesn't matter here.<br> Such a pretty silver case.<br> I showed you the inscription, didn't I?<br> There's so much...<br> ...so much confusion in the world.<br> Thank you for being so kind.<br> I need kindness now.<br> Bananas!<br> Bananas!<br> Oh, my baby. My baby sister!<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - He's left?<br> - Will he be back?<br> - He's getting the car greased.<br> I've been half-crazy.<br> How could you come back last night?<br> Please, he was as good as<br> a lamb when I came back.<br> He's really very ashamed of himself.<br> And that makes it all right?<br> Stanley's always smashed things.<br> On our wedding night, as<br> soon as we came in here...<br> ...he snatched off my slipper and<br> rushed around smashing light bulbs.<br> He did what?<br> He smashed all the light bulbs<br> with the heel of my slipper.<br> And you let him, didn't run?<br> I was sort of thrilled by it.<br> Eunice and you had breakfast?<br> Do you suppose I wanted any breakfast?<br> You're so matter of fact<br> about it all, Stella.<br> Well, what other can I be?<br> He took the radio to get it fixed.<br> It didn't land on the pavement<br> so only one tube smashed.<br> - And you stand there smiling?<br> - What should I do?<br> - Face the facts.<br> - What are they, in your opinion?<br> You're married to a madman.<br> I have a plan for us<br> both to get out of here.<br> Stop taking it for granted<br> that I want to get out.<br> I take for granted you have<br> sufficient memory of Belle Reve...<br> ...to find it impossible to live here.<br> - You take too much for granted.<br> I can't believe you.<br> I understand how it happened.<br> You saw him first in uniform,<br> an officer, not here...<br> That doesn't make any difference.<br> We're talking about his desire.<br> His brutal desire.<br> The name of that streetcar that<br> bangs through the quarter.<br> Up one narrow street and down another.<br> Have you ever ridden on that streetcar?<br> It brought me here...<br> ...where I'm not wanted.<br> Where I'm ashamed to be.<br> Isn't your superior attitude<br> a little out of place?<br> - A man like that.<br> - I love him!<br> I tremble for you.<br> I can't help your trembling<br> if you insist on trembling.<br> May I speak plainly?<br> Yes, do. Go ahead.<br> As plainly as you want.<br> If you'll forgive me...<br> ...he's common.<br> Yes, I suppose he is.<br> Suppose?<br> You can't have forgotten that<br> much of our upbringing...<br> ...that you suppose there's any<br> part of a gentleman in his nature.<br> You're hating me saying<br> this, aren't you?<br> Go on. Say it all, Blanche.<br> He's like an animal.<br> He has an animal's habits.<br> There's something subhuman about him.<br> Thousands of years have passed<br> him by and there he is...<br> ...Stanley Kowalski,<br> survivor of the Stone Age...<br> ...bearing the raw meat home<br> from the kill in the jungle.<br> You wait. Maybe he'll strike<br> you... or grunt, kiss you...<br> ...if kisses have been discovered.<br> His poker night, you call it.<br> His party of apes?<br> Maybe we are a long way from<br> being made in God's image...<br> ...but, Stella, my sister...<br> ...there's been progress since then.<br> Such things as art, as poetry, as music.<br> In some kinds of people, some tenderer<br> feelings have had a little beginning...<br> ...that we must make<br> grow and cling to...<br> ...and hold as our flag in this march<br> toward whatever it is we're approaching.<br> Don't, don't hang back with the brutes!<br> Hi ya.<br> Is Blanche back yet?<br> Yeah, she's back.<br> Oh, hi there, Blanche.<br> Looks like you got under the car.<br> That jerk mechanic down at Fritz's<br> doesn't know grease from 3rd base.<br> Don't throw that thing at me!<br> I can fix things.<br> - Just what I gave your brother.<br> - I'll call the police.<br> He hit me. I'm calling the police.<br> You saw!<br> Your sister's friends have<br> stayed in the city awhile.<br> Did Eunice get the police?<br> - No, she's getting a drink.<br> - That's much more practical.<br> Blanche is making us new slipcovers.<br> Is she here?<br> She went to the Four Deuces.<br> That no-good, rotten...<br> I can't find my other pair of shoes.<br> We cleaned in there.<br> I'll get them.<br> I can't find nothing<br> around this dump anymore.<br> What sign were you born under?<br> What sign?<br> Astrological sign.<br> I bet you were born under Aries.<br> Aries people are forceful, dynamic.<br> They dote on noise.<br> They love to bang things around.<br> Stanley was born five<br> minutes after Christmas.<br> Capricorn. The goat!<br> Say...<br> ...do you know somebody named Shaw?<br> Everybody knows someone<br> by the name of Shaw.<br> This somebody named Shaw<br> believes he met you in Auriol.<br> But I figure he must of mixed you up<br> with someone else because this party...<br> ...he met at a hotel<br> called The Flamingo.<br> I guess he does have me mixed<br> up with this other party.<br> The Hotel Flamingo is not a<br> place I'd dare to be seen in.<br> You know it then?<br> I've seen it...<br> ...and smelled it.<br> You must've got close to smell it.<br> The odor of cheap<br> perfume is penetrating.<br> You use expensive stuff?<br> $12 an ounce. I'm nearly out...<br> ...if you want to remember...<br> I figure that he must<br> of got you mixed up.<br> But he goes in and out of<br> Auriol all the time...<br> ...so he can check and<br> clear up any mistake.<br> See you at the Four Deuces.<br> Don't I rate a kiss?<br> Not in front of your sister.<br> Don't cry. I only do that with<br> other girls because I love you, baby.<br> It's a fact.<br> You still scared of thunder?<br> What've you heard about me?<br> What have people been telling you...<br> ...about me?<br> Telling?<br> You haven't heard any...<br> ...unkind gossip about me?<br> Why, no, Blanche. Of course not.<br> Honey...<br> ...there was quite a lot of talk...<br> ...in Auriol.<br> People talk, who cares?<br> I haven't been so good<br> the last year or so...<br> ...since Belle Reve began slipping away.<br> - We all do things.<br> - I was never hard enough.<br> Soft people...<br> ...have got to court<br> the favor of hard ones.<br> They must shimmer and glow.<br> How much longer I can turn the trick?<br> It isn't enough to be soft.<br> You must be soft...<br> ...and attractive.<br> And I...<br> I'm fading now.<br> Have you been listening to me?<br> I never listen when you're being morbid.<br> Is that for me?<br> - Not for anyone else.<br> - You precious lamb. Is it just a coke?<br> - You want a shot in it?<br> - A shot never did a coke any harm.<br> Let me.<br> - You mustn't wait on me.<br> - I like to wait on you.<br> Makes it seem more like home.<br> I have to admit...<br> ...I love to be waited on.<br> - Honey, what is it?<br> - You're so good to me and I...<br> I know you hate me to talk sentimental<br> but believe me, I feel more than I say.<br> - I won't stay long. I promise.<br> - Now, Blanche.<br> I'll go. I'll go soon.<br> I won't hang around<br> till he throws me out!<br> - Now will you stop talking foolish?<br> - Watch how you pour it.<br> Heavens.<br> Right on my...<br> ...pretty pink skirt.<br> Use my hankie. Blot gently.<br> I know.<br> Gently.<br> Gently.<br> Gently.<br> Did it stain?<br> No, not a bit.<br> Isn't that lucky?<br> Honey, why did you scream like that?<br> Why?<br> I don't know why.<br> Mitch is coming at seven.<br> I'm nervous about our relations.<br> He hasn't gotten anything<br> more than a good-night kiss.<br> I want his respect. Men don't<br> want things they get easily.<br> Men lose interest quickly,<br> especially when a girl...<br> ...is over 30.<br> When I mentioned marriage...<br> ...they even forgot where I lived...<br> So, you see, I haven't<br> informed him of my real age.<br> Honey, why are you so<br> sensitive about your age?<br> Because of...<br> ...hard knocks my...<br> ...my vanity's been given.<br> What I mean is, he thinks I'm sort<br> of prim and proper, you know.<br> I want to deceive him...<br> ...just enough to make him want me.<br> Darling...<br> ...do you want him?<br> I want to rest.<br> I want to breathe quietly again.<br> Yes, I want Mitch...<br> ...very badly.<br> Just think, if it happens...<br> ...I can go away from here...<br> ...and not be anyone's problem.<br> Blanche, it will happen.<br> It will?<br> It will, honey, it will!<br> Only...<br> ...don't take another drink.<br> Get away!<br> Get away!<br> Put me down!<br> Hi, fatty!<br> Don't!<br> Oh, me.<br> Come in.<br> Evening, ma'am.<br> Oh, well.<br> What can I do for you?<br> I'm collecting for the Evening Star.<br> I didn't know stars took up collections.<br> It's a paper, ma'am.<br> I know.<br> I was joking, feebly.<br> Will you have a drink?<br> No, ma'am.<br> No, thank you.<br> I can't drink on the job.<br> Well, now, let me see.<br> No, I don't have a dime.<br> I'm not the lady of the<br> house, I'm her sister.<br> I'm one of those poor relations<br> you've heard tell about.<br> That's all right, I'll come back later.<br> Have you got a light?<br> Sure.<br> This doesn't always work.<br> It's temperamental.<br> Why, thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> What time is it?<br> Fifteen of seven.<br> So late?<br> Don't you love these long rainy<br> afternoons in New Orleans...<br> ...when an hour isn't an hour but a<br> piece of eternity dropped in our hands?<br> And who knows what to do with it?<br> You didn't get caught in the rain?<br> No, ma'am.<br> I stepped inside.<br> In a drugstore and had a soda.<br> Chocolate?<br> Cherry.<br> You're going to make my mouth water.<br> I guess I...<br> Young man!<br> Young...<br> ...young...<br> ...young man.<br> Did anyone ever tell you you look like<br> a prince out of the Arabian Nights?<br> You do, honey lamb.<br> Come here.<br> Come on over here like I told you.<br> I want to kiss you just once...<br> ...softly...<br> ...and sweetly on your mouth.<br> Run away now, quickly.<br> I'd like to keep you, but I must be<br> good and keep my hands off children.<br> Look who's here!<br> My Rosenkavalier!<br> Oh, bow to me first.<br> Now, present them.<br> Hi ya, Mitch.<br> You haven't had much<br> fun out of this evening.<br> I spoiled it for you.<br> No, you didn't.<br> I couldn't rise to the<br> occasion, that was all.<br> I've never tried so hard to be gay<br> and made such a dismal mess of it.<br> I get 10 points for trying. I did try.<br> Hello, moon.<br> I'm looking for the Pleiades,<br> the Seven Sisters...<br> ...but these girls aren't out tonight.<br> Yes, they are. There<br> they are, God bless them.<br> All in a bunch going home from<br> their little bridge party.<br> May I kiss you?<br> Why do you always ask me if you may?<br> I don't know if you want me to.<br> - Why so doubtful?<br> - When we kissed at the lake...<br> It wasn't the kiss I objected to.<br> I liked the kiss.<br> It was the other familiarity<br> I felt obliged to discourage.<br> Not that I resented it, not a bit.<br> I was flattered that you...<br> ...desired me.<br> But, you and I know<br> that a single girl...<br> ...has got to keep a firm hold on<br> her emotions or she'll be lost.<br> Lost?<br> I guess you're used to the type<br> of girl that likes to be lost.<br> I like you to be exactly<br> the way that you are.<br> In all my experience I have<br> never known anyone like you.<br> Are you laughing at me?<br> No, honey.<br> I'm not laughing at you.<br> Come on, let's finish our nightcap.<br> You've been so anxious and solemn<br> all evening, we both have.<br> For these last remaining<br> moments of our lives together...<br> ...I want to create joie de vivre!<br> I'm lighting this candle.<br> That's good.<br> I'm going to be very bohemian.<br> We are going to pretend we're sitting<br> in a little artists' cafe in Paris.<br> Understand?<br> No, I don't understand French.<br> Sit down. Take off your coat.<br> - Loosen your collar.<br> - No, I better leave it on.<br> Be comfortable.<br> I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.<br> My shirt's sticking to me.<br> Perspiration is healthy.<br> If people didn't perspire they'd die.<br> This is a nice coat.<br> What material is it?<br> They call this stuff alpaca.<br> It's very lightweight, alpaca.<br> Oh, lightweight alpaca.<br> I don't like to wear a wash-coat<br> because I sweat right through it.<br> A man with a heavy build has to be<br> careful of what he puts on him.<br> You're not too heavy.<br> You think so?<br> You're not delicate.<br> You have a massive bone structure<br> and a very imposing physique.<br> I thank you.<br> Last Christmas I was given a<br> membership to the Sports Club.<br> - Good.<br> - It was the finest present I ever got.<br> I lift weights there. I swim.<br> I keep myself fit.<br> When I started, I was soft in<br> the belly, but now it's hard.<br> It's so hard a man can<br> punch me and it don't hurt.<br> Punch me.<br> Go ahead. Punch.<br> Come on.<br> Gracious.<br> See?<br> Guess my weight.<br> I'd say in the vicinity of<br> one hundred and eighty pounds.<br> - Guess again.<br> - Not so much?<br> No, more!<br> I weight 207 pounds. I'm six feet,<br> Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.<br> My weight's not a very interesting<br> subject. What's yours?<br> My weight?<br> Guess.<br> Let me lift you.<br> Samson!<br> Go on, lift me!<br> - You're light as a feather!<br> - You may release me now.<br> I said, unhand me, sir.<br> We're in public. You must<br> behave like a gentleman.<br> Slap me if I get out of bounds.<br> It won't be necessary.<br> You're a natural gentleman.<br> One of the few in the world.<br> I don't want you to think that<br> I'm severe or old-maid-ish.<br> It's just, well, I guess I have...<br> ...old-fashioned ideals.<br> Where's Stanley and Stella?<br> They were planning to take<br> in a midnight preview.<br> We should all go out together.<br> That's not a good plan.<br> Why not?<br> You are an old friend of Stanley's?<br> We was together in the 241st.<br> I guess he talks to you frankly.<br> Has he talked about me?<br> - Not much.<br> - The way you say that, I suspect he has.<br> Not much.<br> What would you say his<br> attitude toward me was?<br> Why ask that?<br> - Well?<br> - Don't you get along with him?<br> What do you think?<br> I think he don't understand you.<br> That's putting it mildly.<br> Surely, he must've told<br> you how much he hates me!<br> He doesn't hate you.<br> He hates me! Or why would he insult me?<br> Of course...<br> ...there is such a thing<br> as the hostility of...<br> Perhaps, in some strange<br> kind of way he...<br> To think of it makes me...<br> Yes, honey?<br> - Can I ask you a question?<br> - Yes. What?<br> How old are you?<br> What do you want to know that for?<br> I talked to my mother about you<br> and she said, "How old is Blanche?"<br> You talked to your mother about me?<br> Yes.<br> Why?<br> Because I told her how nice<br> you were... and I liked you.<br> Were you...<br> ...sincere about that?<br> You know I was!<br> Why did your mother<br> want to know my age?<br> She's sick and...<br> I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?<br> She won't live long.<br> Maybe just a few months.<br> She worries because I'm not settled.<br> She wants me to settle down before she...<br> You love her very much, don't you?<br> You'll be Ionely when<br> she passes on, won't you?<br> I know what that means.<br> To be Ionely?<br> I loved someone once...<br> ...and the person I loved, I lost.<br> Dead?<br> He was a boy...<br> ...just a boy when I<br> was a very young girl.<br> When I was sixteen I made<br> the discovery, love.<br> All at once and much,<br> much too completely.<br> It was like you suddenly<br> turned a blinding light...<br> ...on something that<br> had been half in shadow.<br> That's how it struck the world for me.<br> But I was unlucky...<br> ...deluded.<br> There was something about him...<br> ...a nervousness... a tenderness...<br> ...an uncertainty.<br> And I didn't understand.<br> I didn't understand why this<br> boy who wrote poetry...<br> ...didn't seem able to do anything else.<br> Lost every job.<br> He came to me for help.<br> I didn't know that.<br> I didn't know anything...<br> ...except that I loved him...<br> ...unendurably.<br> At night, I pretended to sleep.<br> I heard him crying.<br> Crying.<br> Crying the way a lost child cries.<br> I don't understand.<br> No, neither did I!<br> That is why...<br> ...I killed him!<br> You?<br> One night...<br> ...we drove out to a place<br> called Moon Lake Casino.<br> We danced the Varsouviana.<br> In the middle of the dance floor...<br> ...the boy I had married broke away<br> from me and ran out of the casino.<br> Minutes later...<br> ...a shot!<br> I ran.<br> All did.<br> All ran and gathered about the terrible<br> thing at the edge of the lake.<br> He'd stuck a revolver into his mouth...<br> ...and fired.<br> It was because on the dance floor...<br> ...unable to stop myself, I'd said:<br> "You're weak.<br> I've lost respect for you.<br> I despise you."<br> And then...<br> ...the searchlight which had<br> been turned on the world...<br> ...was turned off again...<br> ...and never...<br> ...for one moment since has there<br> been any light stronger than...<br> ...than this...<br> ...yellow lantern.<br> You need somebody.<br> And I need somebody too.<br> Could it be you and me, Blanche?<br> Sometimes...<br> ...there's God...<br> ...so quickly.<br> If you want to mess with me, come on!<br> - I'll kill you!<br> - Cut him loose.<br> - You don't know when you get wised up.<br> - Cut it out!<br> - You don't have to wise me up!<br> Come on! Get to work.<br> We gotta get going.<br> We got some bucks to make.<br> Go ahead and marry her, but hurry up<br> because she's been at my house 5 months.<br> It's only a paper moon<br> Sailing over a cardboard sea<br> But it wouldn't be make-believe<br> If you believed in me<br> It's a Barnum and Bailey world<br> Just as phony as it...<br> Hello, Stanley!<br> But it wouldn't be make-believe<br> If you believed in me<br> Some canary bird.<br> All right.<br> Tell me quietly just what you think<br> you found out about my sister.<br> You know your sister is no lily, right?<br> What have you heard and who from?<br> You should know the line that<br> she's has been feeding Mitch.<br> Our supply man's gone through Auriol<br> for years and he knows all about her.<br> And everybody in the town of<br> Auriol knows all about her.<br> She's as famous in Auriol as if she<br> was the United States President.<br> Only she's not respected by any party.<br> So she moved to the<br> hotel called Flamingo...<br> ...which is a second-class hotel...<br> ...and has the advantages<br> of not interfering...<br> ...with the private and social<br> life of the personalities there.<br> The Flamingo is used to<br> all kinds of goings-on...<br> But even the management of the Flamingo<br> was impressed by Dame Blanche.<br> They were so impressed, they requested<br> she turn in her room key permanently.<br> And this happened a couple of<br> weeks before she showed here.<br> Honey, I know how this<br> is gonna upset you.<br> She pulled the wool over your<br> eyes just as much as Mitch's.<br> Pure invention. Not a word of truth.<br> I checked on every story.<br> The trouble was she couldn't<br> put on her act anymore.<br> They wised up and in a few days, they'd<br> quit and she'd go get another one.<br> The same old line, the same<br> old act and the same old hooey.<br> She became the town character...<br> ...regarded not just as different,<br> but downright nuts!<br> Which brings us to lie #2.<br> Now, listen.<br> She didn't resign because of her nerves.<br> She was kicked out before<br> the spring term ended.<br> I hate to tell you the<br> reason that step was taken.<br> A 17-year-old kid she got mixed up with.<br> The boy's dad learned about it and he<br> got in touch with the superintendent.<br> There was practically a town<br> ordinance passed against her.<br> Yes.<br> Could I have a towel for my hair?<br> I just washed it.<br> Yes, honey.<br> What's the matter?<br> Why?<br> You have a strange<br> expression on your face.<br> I guess I'm a little tired.<br> Why don't you take a hot<br> bath as soon as I get out?<br> How soon will that be?<br> Not so long. Possess<br> your soul in patience.<br> It's not my soul I'm worried about.<br> Well...<br> How many candles are there?<br> I'm going to stop at 25.<br> You got company expected?<br> We asked Mitch to come over.<br> Don't expect Mitch over here tonight.<br> Why?<br> Mitch is a buddy of mine. We was<br> together in the 241st Engineers.<br> We work in the same plant!<br> We're on the same bowling team!<br> Stanley Kowalski, did you repeat...<br> You bet I did. I'd have it on my<br> conscience if I knew that stuff...<br> ...and let him get caught!<br> - Is Mitch through with her?<br> I don't know, but he's wised up.<br> He was going to marry her!<br> He's not going to now! He's not<br> going to jump into a tank of sharks!<br> But what on earth will she do?<br> Her future is mapped out for her.<br> What do you mean?<br> Hey, toots! Canary bird!<br> Will you get out of the bathroom?!<br> I feel so good after a long hot bath.<br> I feel so good and cool and rested.<br> Do you?<br> Yes, I do. So refreshed.<br> A hot bath and a long, cold drink...<br> ...always gives me a<br> brand-new outlook on life.<br> What's wrong?<br> Something's happened.<br> What is it?<br> Nothing's happened.<br> You're lying.<br> Something has.<br> Tell us a joke.<br> Tell us a funny story and make us laugh.<br> We're all so solemn. Is it because<br> I've been stood up by my beau?<br> It's the first time in my<br> experience with men...<br> ...that I've been stood up.<br> I don't know how to take it.<br> Tell us a funny story. Something to...<br> ...help us out.<br> I didn't think you liked my stories.<br> I like them when they're<br> amusing, but not indecent.<br> I don't know any refined enough for you.<br> Then, let me tell one.<br> Yes. You used to know<br> a lot of good stories.<br> Let me see. I have to<br> run through my repertoire.<br> I love parrot stories. Do you?<br> This is about an old maid.<br> She had a parrot that cursed.<br> And knew more vulgar<br> expressions than Mr. Kowalski.<br> The only way to hush the parrot<br> up was to put the cover...<br> It must be upstairs.<br> The only way to hush<br> the parrot up was...<br> Go on, Blanche.<br> I don't think he will be amused.<br> He's too busy making a pig of<br> himself to think of anything else.<br> Your face and fingers<br> are disgustingly greasy.<br> Wash, then help me clear the table.<br> That's how I'm going to clear the table.<br> Don't you ever talk that way to me.<br> "Pig, Polack, disgusting,<br> vulgar, greasy!"<br> Those kind of words have been on your<br> and your sister's tongue too much.<br> Who do you think you are, queens?<br> Huey Long said every man's a king...<br> ...and I'm the king around here.<br> Don't forget it.<br> My place is all cleared.<br> Want me to clear yours?<br> What happened while I bathed?<br> - What did he tell you?<br> - Nothing, nothing.<br> He told you something<br> about Mitch and me.<br> You know why Mitch didn't come<br> tonight, but you won't tell me.<br> I'll call him.<br> - Don't call him.<br> - Yes. I'll call him on the phone.<br> I wouldn't.<br> I intend to be given an explanation.<br> I hope you're pleased with your doings.<br> I never had so much trouble<br> swallowing food in my life...<br> ...Iooking at that girl's<br> face and that empty chair.<br> Hello!<br> I want to talk to Mr. Mitchell.<br> I'd like to leave a number.<br> Glen 4-947.<br> And say it's important to call.<br> Honey, it's going to be all right<br> after she goes and you have the baby.<br> It'll be all right between<br> you and me, the way it was.<br> Remember how it was?<br> It'll be so sweet when we can<br> get them colored lights going...<br> ...with nobody's sister to hear us.<br> Steve and Eunice.<br> Come on back in.<br> Come on, hon.<br> What pretty, pretty candles.<br> Don't burn them, Stella.<br> I certainly will.<br> Save them for baby's birthdays.<br> I hope candles will glow in his life.<br> I hope his eyes will be like candles...<br> ...like two blue candles...<br> ...lighted in a white cake.<br> What poetry.<br> I shouldn't have called him.<br> You know it's hot in there with<br> the steam from that bathroom?<br> I said I was sorry three times!<br> I take hot baths for my nerves.<br> Hydrotherapy, they call it.<br> You healthy, nerveless Polack...<br> ...how can you possibly know<br> what anxiety feels like?<br> I am not a Polack!<br> People from Poland are Poles.<br> They are not Polacks.<br> But what I am is 100% American.<br> I'm born in the greatest country<br> on earth and I'm proud of it!<br> Don't ever call me a Polack!<br> - That's for me, I'm sure!<br> - Keep your seat. I'm not so sure.<br> Yeah, Mac.<br> Keep your hands off me, Stella.<br> Why do you look at me so pityingly?<br> Will you shut up!<br> We got a noisy woman in the place.<br> I told you, I don't want to bowl at<br> Riley's. I had trouble with him.<br> I'm the team captain, ain't I?<br> We're not bowling at Riley's.<br> We'll bowl at the Gala. I'll see you.<br> Sister Blanche...<br> ...I got a little birthday<br> remembrance for you.<br> I hope you like it.<br> It's a...<br> A ticket back to Auriol<br> on the bus. Tuesday.<br> You didn't need to do that.<br> Don't forget all I took off of her.<br> You didn't need to be so<br> cruel to someone so alone.<br> - She's delicate.<br> - She is. She was.<br> You didn't know Blanche as a girl.<br> Nobody was as tender and as trusting.<br> Till people like you abused her.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Do you think you're going bowling?<br> Yes.<br> You're not. Why did you do this to her?<br> - Let go of me!<br> - I want to know why?!<br> You tore it!<br> Listen, when we first met, you<br> and me, you thought I was common.<br> You were right. I was common as dirt.<br> I saw a photo of a place with columns.<br> I pulled you off them and you loved it.<br> Having colored lights going.<br> Wasn't we happy? Wasn't<br> it okay till she showed?<br> Wasn't we happy together?<br> Wasn't it all okay till she showed?<br> Hoity-toity and<br> describing me like a ape?<br> What's wrong with you?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Did I hurt you?<br> Baby, what is it?<br> Take me to the hospital.<br> Who is it, please.<br> It's me.<br> Me, Mitch!<br> Just a minute, please.<br> Coming.<br> Coming.<br> Hello.<br> I shouldn't let you in after<br> the treatment I received.<br> So utterly uncavalier.<br> But, hello, beautiful.<br> Oh, what a cold shoulder.<br> What uncouth apparel.<br> You haven't shaved!<br> I forgive you because it's<br> such a relief to see you.<br> You've stopped that polka tune in<br> my head. Has that happened to you?<br> No, you'd never get anything<br> awful caught in your head.<br> Must that be on?<br> I don't like fans.<br> Let's turn it off.<br> I'm not partial to them.<br> I don't know what there is to drink.<br> - I don't want Stan's liquor.<br> - It isn't Stan's!<br> Some things on the premises are<br> actually mine. How's your mother?<br> - Is your mother well?<br> - Why?<br> Something's wrong with you, but never<br> mind. I won't cross-examine you.<br> I'll pretend I didn't notice anything.<br> That music again.<br> What music?<br> The polka they were<br> playing when Allan...<br> Wait!<br> There!<br> The shot!<br> It always stops after that.<br> Now it's stopped.<br> Are you boxed out of your mind?<br> I'll see what I can find in the way...<br> Forgive me not being dressed.<br> I'd practically given you up.<br> Had you forgotten the dinner?<br> - I wasn't going to see you again.<br> - I can't hear what you're saying.<br> You talk so seldom, when you do<br> say anything I want to hear it.<br> What am I looking for?<br> Oh, yes, liquor. We've had so much<br> excitement I am boxed out of my mind.<br> Here's something.<br> "Southern Cheer."<br> What can that be, I wonder.<br> Take your foot off the bed.<br> The cover's clean. Men don't notice that.<br> - I've done so much to this place.<br> - Aren't you leaving soon?<br> Should this be mixed with something?<br> It's sweet. Terribly sweet.<br> I believe it's liqueur.<br> I don't think you'll like it, but<br> try it and maybe you will.<br> I told you I don't want any<br> of his liquor and I mean it.<br> He says you've been lapping it up.<br> I don't descend to the level<br> of such cheap accusations.<br> What's on your mind?<br> I see something in your eyes.<br> - It's dark in here.<br> - I like the dark, it's comforting to me.<br> I've never seen you in the light.<br> - Is it?<br> - I've never seen you in the afternoon.<br> You're at the plant in the afternoon.<br> Not on Sunday afternoon!<br> You never want to go out till after 6,<br> and then to a dark place.<br> There's an obscure meaning here.<br> It means I've never had a good look<br> at you. Let's turn on the light.<br> - Which light? What for?<br> - This one with the paper thing on it.<br> Why did you do that?<br> So I can get a good look at you.<br> - You don't mean to be insulting.<br> - No. Just realistic!<br> I don't want realism. I want magic!<br> Yes, yes, magic.<br> I try to give that to people.<br> I do misrepresent things!<br> I tell what ought to be truth.<br> If that is sinful, punish me.<br> Don't turn the light on!<br> I don't mind you being older<br> than what I thought but...<br> But all the rest of it!<br> Why that pitch about your ideals<br> being so old-fashioned and...<br> ...all the malarkey you've<br> dished out all summer.<br> I knew you weren't 16 but I was fool<br> enough to believe you were straight.<br> Who said I wasn't straight? My loving<br> brother-in-law? You believed him?<br> No, I called him a liar at first,<br> then I checked on the story.<br> I talked to a merchant in Auriol!<br> What merchant?<br> Kiefaber.<br> The merchant Kiefaber. I know him.<br> He whistled at me. I put him in<br> his place. He's taking revenge.<br> Did you stay at the Flamingo?<br> Flamingo?<br> No!<br> Tarantula was the name of it.<br> I stayed at a hotel called<br> the Tarantula Arms!<br> Yes, a big spider, that's<br> where I brought my victims.<br> I have had many meetings with strangers.<br> After the death of Allan...<br> ...meetings with strangers...<br> ...was all I seemed able to<br> fill my empty heart with.<br> I think it was panic...<br> ...that drove me from one to another,<br> searching for protection...<br> ...here, there, and then...<br> ...in the most unlikely places.<br> Even, at last, in a<br> seventeen-year-old boy.<br> Someone wrote the superintendent.<br> "This woman is morally<br> unfit for her position."<br> True?<br> Yes.<br> Unfit somehow, anyway.<br> So I came here.<br> There was nowhere else I could go.<br> I was played out.<br> Do you know what played out is?<br> My youth was gone!<br> And I met you.<br> You said you needed someone.<br> Well, I needed someone too.<br> I thanked God for you.<br> You seemed gentle...<br> ...a cleft in the rock of the<br> world that I could hide in.<br> I suppose I was asking...<br> ...hoping...<br> ...too much.<br> Kiefaber...<br> ...Harris and Shaw...<br> ...have tied an old tin can<br> to the tail of the kite!<br> I thought you were straight.<br> Straight?<br> What's straight?<br> A line can be straight or a street.<br> But the heart of a human being?<br> - You lied to me.<br> - Don't say I lied to you.<br> Lies, inside and out! All lies!<br> Never inside!<br> I never lied in my heart.<br> Woman outside.<br> Flowers! Flowers for the dead.<br> Not now!<br> I've lived in a house where dying<br> old women remembered their dead men.<br> Crumble and fade.<br> Regrets!<br> Recriminations!<br> "If you'd done this, it<br> wouldn't have cost me that!"<br> Legacies...<br> ...and other things, such as<br> blood-stained pillowslips.<br> I used to sit here...<br> ...and she sat there.<br> And death was as close as you are.<br> Death:<br> The opposite of desire.<br> How could you wonder?<br> How could you possibly wonder?<br> Not far from Belle Reve...<br> ...before we had lost Belle Reve, was a<br> camp where they trained young soldiers.<br> On Saturday nights, they would<br> go into town and get drunk...<br> ...and on the way back, they would<br> stagger onto my lawn and call:<br> " Blanche!"<br> " Blanche!"<br> What do you want?<br> Marry me, Mitch!<br> I don't think I want<br> to marry you anymore.<br> No?<br> No. You're not clean enough to<br> bring in the house with my...<br> Go away then!<br> Get out of here.<br> Quick, before I start screaming.<br> Get out, before I start screaming!<br> Screaming!<br> Screaming!<br> Are you all right?<br> What's the matter?<br> What's the matter?<br> - Somebody better get a policeman.<br> - There's one.<br> What happened?<br> It's the police. Open up.<br> Open up in there!<br> It's a police officer.<br> Go away.<br> What's wrong, are you hurt?<br> Yes, go away!<br> - I'll be good.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'll be good.<br> That's all. Break it up.<br> I'll be good.<br> I'll be good. I'll be good.<br> Gracious, what a thing.<br> How about taking a swim?<br> A moonlight swim at the old rock quarry?<br> If anyone is sober enough to drive.<br> The best way to stop your head buzzing.<br> Only you have to be careful to<br> dive where the deep pool is.<br> If you hit a rock, you<br> won't come up till tomorrow.<br> My goodness!<br> They're playing, "Good Night, Ladies."<br> May I rest my weary<br> head on your shoulder?<br> It's so...<br> ...comforting.<br> Hi, Blanche.<br> How's my sister?<br> She's doing okay.<br> How's the baby?<br> The baby won't come until tomorrow,<br> so they told me to come home.<br> That means...<br> ...we are to be alone in here?<br> Yes, just you and me, Blanche.<br> Why've you got those fine feathers on?<br> That's right.<br> You left before my wire came.<br> Did you get a wire?<br> I received a telegram from<br> an old admirer of mine.<br> Anything good?<br> I think so. An invitation.<br> What to?<br> A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.<br> What d' you know!<br> I was never so surprised in my life.<br> It was a bolt from the blue.<br> Who'd you say sent it?<br> An old beau of mine.<br> The one that give you the fox fur?<br> Shep Huntleigh.<br> I wore his pin in college.<br> Haven't seen him for awhile and now...<br> ...this wire inviting me on a cruise!<br> The problem is clothes. I tore into<br> my trunk to see what I had to wear.<br> And you come up with a diamond tiara?<br> This relic? It's rhinestones.<br> I thought it was Tiffany's diamonds.<br> Well, anyhow, I shall be<br> entertained in style.<br> It goes to show you<br> never know what's coming.<br> Just when I thought luck was failing me.<br> Into the picture pops<br> this Miami millionaire.<br> He's not from Miami. He's from Dallas.<br> Just so he's from somewhere.<br> Close the curtains before<br> you undress any further.<br> This is all I'll undress right now.<br> You seen the bottle opener?<br> I used to have a cousin who could<br> open a beer bottle with his teeth.<br> That was all he could do.<br> He was just a human bottle-opener.<br> And then...<br> ...one time, at a wedding party,<br> he broke his front teeth off.<br> And then, after that, he<br> was so ashamed of himself...<br> ...that he used to sneak out of<br> the house when company came.<br> Rain from heaven!<br> You want to bury the hatchet<br> and make it a loving cup?<br> No, thank you.<br> - Why don't you get with it?<br> - What are you doing in here?<br> Wait, I want to show you something.<br> I break this out on special occasions.<br> Silk pajamas I wore on my wedding night.<br> When they call and say, "It's a boy!"...<br> ...I'm going to rip them off<br> and wave them like a flag.<br> We're entitled to put on the dog.<br> You have a millionaire and I have a baby.<br> Think of how divine it'll be to have<br> privacy again. I could weep with joy.<br> The millionaire won't<br> interfere with your privacy?<br> It won't be like what you have in mind.<br> This gentleman respects me.<br> He wants my companionship. Great<br> wealth sometimes makes people Ionely.<br> A woman of breeding and intelligence<br> can enrich a man's life.<br> I can offer those things.<br> And time doesn't take them away.<br> Physical beauty is passing...<br> ...a transitory possession.<br> But beauty of the mind,<br> richness of the spirit...<br> ...tenderness of the heart... I<br> have all those things...<br> ...don't go away, but grow!<br> Increase with the years!<br> How strange that I should be<br> called a destitute woman...<br> ...when I have all these<br> treasures locked in my heart.<br> I think of myself as a<br> very, very rich woman.<br> But I have been foolish,<br> casting my pearls before...<br> Swine?<br> Swine!<br> I'm thinking of you, and Mr. Mitchell.<br> He came tonight in his work clothes...<br> ...to repeat vicious stories he'd<br> got from you! I gave him his papers.<br> Then he returned with a box of<br> roses to beg my forgiveness.<br> He implored my forgiveness.<br> Some things are not forgivable.<br> Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable.<br> ...it is the one unforgivable<br> thing, in my opinion...<br> ...and the one thing of which<br> I have never, never been guilty.<br> So I said to him, "Thank you...<br> ...but I was foolish to think that<br> we could adapt to one another.<br> Our lives are too different.<br> Our backgrounds are incompatible.<br> So, farewell, my friend...<br> ...and let there be no hard feelings."<br> Was this before or after<br> you got the telegram?<br> Telegram?<br> Telegram?<br> Actually...<br> Actually, there wasn't no wire at all!<br> There isn't no millionaire!<br> And Mitch didn't come with roses<br> because I know where he is!<br> There isn't a thing but imagination<br> and lies and deceit and tricks!<br> Look at yourself! Look at yourself...<br> ...in an old Mardi Gras outfit...<br> ...rented for 50 cents<br> from some rag picker!<br> What kind of queen do you think you are?<br> I've been onto you from the start.<br> And not once did you pull<br> the wool over my eyes.<br> You come in here and sprinkle the<br> place with powder and perfume...<br> ...put a lantern over the bulb...<br> ...and the place has turned into Egypt<br> and you are the queen of the Nile...<br> ...sitting on the throne,<br> drinking my liquor.
