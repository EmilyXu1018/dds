                        Get up. Get up. Come on.<br> Get up. Get up.<br> Get up there, get up there.<br> Come on there.<br> Now push hard.<br> Get up. Push hard. Come on.<br> Come on, there. Come on, there.<br> Blimey.<br> Hey, Joe, what o'clock is it?<br> It must be nearly 11.<br> Eleven, and we ain't atop<br> of Shooter's Hill yet?<br> - Push.<br> - Come on, now. Hey.<br> Come on.<br> Aye, Joe.<br> What do you say it is, Tom?<br> Well, I'd say it's a horse<br> coming up at a canter.<br> Well, I say it's a horse<br> coming up at a gallop.<br> Gentlemen, in the king's name,<br> on guard, all of you.<br> Dover mail?<br> Are you the Dover mail?<br> Never mind what we are. What are you?<br> I'm a messenger from Tellson's Bank.<br> Stand! No nearer.<br> I wants Mr. Jarvis Lorry.<br> I've got a message for him from his bank.<br> Here I am. Is that Jerry Cruncher?<br> Right you are, sir.<br> Stop! Keep where you are.<br> It's quite all right. I know him.<br> Then step over and speak to him if<br> you must, but don't let him come no nearer.<br> You never know these days.<br> What is the message, Jerry?<br> The message is to wait at<br> the Royal George for mademoiselle.<br> She'll be at Dover.<br> Give this reply to the office, Jerry:<br> "Recalled to life. "<br> "Recalled to life. "<br> Right you are, sir.<br> - Did you hear the message, sir?<br> - I did.<br> - What did you make of it?<br> - Nothing at all.<br> That's a coincidence too.<br> That's what I made of it myself.<br> Now then, gentlemen,<br> all together, please.<br> - Hot gravy, sir?<br> - No, no.<br> The young lady you were expecting, sir...<br> ...Miss Manette...<br> - Yes.<br> - She has arrived, sir.<br> - Good.<br> It's business. Strictly business.<br> Of course, sir.<br> I'm from Tellson's Bank in London,<br> and it is business.<br> Quite, quite.<br> I am Mr. Jarvis Lorry Jr.<br> Of Tellson and Company, bankers.<br> Your humble servant, miss.<br> Yes, I... I received a letter<br> from the bank, sir...<br> ...informing me that some intelligence,<br> some discovery...<br> The word is not material, miss,<br> either one will do.<br> - Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?<br> - Miss Manette, I am a man of business.<br> Pay no more attention to me<br> than if I were a machine.<br> - I am not much else.<br> - But I know you. I'm sure I know you.<br> Yes. When you were a little girl...<br> ...I was instrumental in bringing you<br> and your mother over to England.<br> No romance. Business, you know.<br> - No room for sentiment in business.<br> - Yes.<br> That was 17 years ago.<br> Yes. I speak, miss, of that time.<br> Our business today has to do<br> with your father, Dr. Manette.<br> - You knew him before he died?<br> - Before...?<br> Yes. Yes, he was a client<br> of Tellson and Company's Paris bank.<br> I am an arm of that bank.<br> That is how you will regard me.<br> A mere mechanical arm<br> of Tellson and Company.<br> Mr. Lorry, what have you<br> come to tell me?<br> Now, let us suppose<br> that your father had not died.<br> - Suppose...<br> - Don't be afraid, child.<br> Mr. Lorry, please do not<br> keep me in suspense.<br> What is it?<br> If your father had not died.<br> If he had suddenly<br> and silently disappeared.<br> If he had an enemy<br> who caused him to be imprisoned...<br> I entreat you, sir.<br> Pray... Pray, tell me.<br> No, no. Don't kneel, child.<br> In heaven's name,<br> why should you kneel to me?<br> For the truth,<br> oh, dear, good, compassionate, sir.<br> For the truth.<br> Mr. Lorry, is my father alive?<br> Yes, child.<br> - Where is he?<br> - You will find him greatly changed.<br> A wreck it is probable,<br> though we will hope for the best.<br> My father.<br> My poor, poor father.<br> Now you know the best and the worst.<br> You will see this poor,<br> wronged gentleman...<br> ...then with a fair sea voyage,<br> and a fair land voyage...<br> What is the matter?<br> Miss Manette, my dear child.<br> What are you doing to my Ladybird?<br> I was just... I... I...<br> I had to tell her some news.<br> You took a fine manner of doing it.<br> You in brown, why couldn't you tell her<br> without frightening her to death?<br> See what you've done to her.<br> You call that being a banker?<br> - I tried to break it as gently as I could.<br> - Gently?<br> I'd like to see you break things roughly.<br> Oh, my pretty. My sweet.<br> Pross is with you now.<br> No one can harm you.<br> My darling.<br> - I assure you, madam, I had no intention...<br> - I am not "madam. "<br> I'm Miss Lucie's companion,<br> and I'm Miss Pross.<br> But, madam, I assure you that...<br> - I'm all right.<br> - Of course you're all right.<br> It was a shock.<br> The man has no sense blurting out<br> whatever he was blurting out...<br> ...as if he were calling coals.<br> Please, Miss Pross.<br> Where is my father?<br> He has been imprisoned<br> at the Bastille 18 years.<br> Eighteen years.<br> Gracious creator of day.<br> To be buried alive for 18 years.<br> But I entreat you, sir, where is he now?<br> An old servant of his, De Farge,<br> is taking care of him.<br> - But where? Where?<br> - In his wine shop in Paris.<br> You must take me to him at once.<br> Well, why do you stand there<br> like a nincompoop?<br> You hear, don't you?<br> She wants to be taken to her father.<br> Isn't it natural she should<br> want to see her father?<br> Well, I will, but...<br> A toast to the king's health.<br> - There's mud in it.<br> - There's food in it.<br> Drink, little one.<br> Never mind the taste.<br> How can men bear such poverty?<br> Bear it? Look, they live within<br> the very shadow of the Bastille.<br> They have to bear it.<br> Don't do that, Jacques.<br> Well, there'll be blood flowing<br> in these streets before long, De Farge.<br> Yes, but keep that thought<br> in your heart, Jacques.<br> Don't waste it on the walls.<br> You're right, Jacques.<br> Jacques, where do you want this wood?<br> In the loft?<br> Jacques, 116 from Bordeaux.<br> Welcome, Jacques. Come inside.<br> A hundred and sixteen from Bordeaux,<br> my wife.<br> Well, Jacques, do you see the way<br> the spilt wine is being sucked up?<br> Every drop.<br> Not often those poor beasts<br> know the taste of wine...<br> ...or of anything<br> but black bread and death.<br> It is so throughout all France.<br> Has he seen our tenant upstairs?<br> Not yet, but I'll show him.<br> Eighteen years imprisoned in the Bastille.<br> Wait till you see him.<br> The sight will burn into the souls<br> of all of the name of Jacques.<br> Strangers. The rose.<br> Madame De Farge?<br> Recalled to life.<br> Yes, yes. We have some<br> very fine old wine upstairs.<br> My husband will show you.<br> Come.<br> You were too young to remember me.<br> I was his servant.<br> Where...? Where is he?<br> Is he greatly changed?<br> Changed, mademoiselle.<br> Changed.<br> You lock him in? Why?<br> He's lived so long that way,<br> that an open door would...<br> Is it possible?<br> All things are possible in France today...<br> ...just as all things<br> will be possible later.<br> Don't come in to him yet.<br> Let us go first.<br> Still hard at work?<br> Yes, I... I'm working.<br> These shoes must be done.<br> You have a visitor, you see.<br> A visitor.<br> Show your work to monsieur.<br> It is a lady's shoe.<br> It is a young lady's walking shoe.<br> It is in the present mode.<br> I never saw the mode.<br> I did it from a drawing.<br> Dr. Manette, do you remember me?<br> Come, come, now. Do you remember<br> an old friend in Tellson's Bank in London?<br> No.<br> No.<br> Who are you?<br> Who are you?<br> It is the same...<br> ...but how can it be?<br> It is the same...<br> ...but she is dead.<br> Yes.<br> My mother is dead, but I am...<br> Can't you feel who I am?<br> She had laid her head on my shoulder...<br> ...and when I was brought<br> to the North Tower...<br> ...they found hair like this...<br> ...on my sleeve.<br> How was this?<br> Was it you?<br> I'm Lucie, her daughter.<br> Your daughter.<br> Do you think he's fit<br> to make a journey to England?<br> Get him out of France for his sake, and for<br> the sake of the Jacquerie who rescued him.<br> - What is this Jacquerie?<br> - One day you will know.<br> All France will know.<br> You're coming with me, Father.<br> Wait.<br> Wait.<br> Where is the place?<br> The brick was here by the bench.<br> It's gone.<br> - What's he looking for?<br> - Something he wrote in the Bastille.<br> And it was left in his cell?<br> No, we found it.<br> A reminder of such horror,<br> it's better he should never see it again.<br> Father, dear, we shall find it.<br> You're coming with me now. Home.<br> Home.<br> No one saw a coach leave here,<br> you understand?<br> Eighteen years in a cell without a trial...<br> ...because an aristocrat chose<br> to brush the good doctor from his path.<br> Too bad we don't know<br> which aristo it was.<br> But I do know.<br> I have cause to remember.<br> His outrages against my own family<br> would never let me forget.<br> Then you have his name on your register?<br> He has the place of honor.<br> The Marquis St. Evremonde.<br> Killed.<br> Dead.<br> The child is dead, Excellency.<br> It's extraordinary to me that you cannot<br> take care of yourselves and your children.<br> One or the other of you<br> is forever in the way.<br> How do you know what injury<br> you might do to my horses?<br> Drive on, faster.<br> Irritating episode.<br> The marquis drives fast.<br> We'll drive him fast to his tomb.<br> My dear nephew,<br> what goes forward here?<br> I'm leaving. I'm going to England.<br> Really?<br> Monsieur Gabelle,<br> when you were my nephew's tutor...<br> ...you shouldn't have encouraged him<br> to be so petulant.<br> You've made the name Evremonde<br> the most detested in all France.<br> I can't endure your cruelty.<br> There is a sickness these days<br> which labels itself humanitarianism.<br> You have no pity for those who suffer.<br> Pity, my dear boy,<br> is a diseased variety of sentimentality.<br> Do you pity the swine<br> whose flesh we eat?<br> The peasants are not swine.<br> That, my dear Charles,<br> is where you and I differ.<br> I'm very much afraid,<br> that you have taught my nephew...<br> ...to take the new philosophy<br> of equality seriously.<br> Now, I enjoy Monsieur Voltaire and<br> these other modern philosophers, but I...<br> I take them lightly,<br> and merely as an exercise for the mind.<br> Most of our lands are stolen.<br> I intend to see them returned<br> to the peasants.<br> Really?<br> Thank your stars that you're related to me,<br> or you might find yourself in the Bastille.<br> Monseigneur, I pray you overlook<br> the impulsiveness of youth.<br> - I'm not frightened of anything you can do.<br> - Charles, I beg of you.<br> I'm not at all sure that it wouldn't be the<br> patriotic thing to imprison you, Charles...<br> ...in spite of the pain<br> it would cause me personally.<br> By the bye, if you should run into<br> any difficulties in England, let me know.<br> The prisons, even in that utopia,<br> are very uncomfortable, they tell me.<br> A pleasant journey, Mr. Darnay.<br> What did he mean by that?<br> The steel hand in the velvet glove.<br> - But he's capable of anything.<br> - I'm not troubled, Gabelle.<br> Charles, let me go with you.<br> I can't take you now...<br> ...but some day we'll be together.<br> God bless you, Charles.<br> On the boat to England,<br> you say, Morveau?<br> Do you think it can be done<br> on the boat to England?<br> Darnay will be arrested the day he lands.<br> You are ingenious, Morveau.<br> I like your plan.<br> - Proceed with it.<br> - Very well, Your Excellency.<br> The boy is capricious.<br> He needs correction.<br> Yes, Your Excellency.<br> Here we are, Dr. Manette,<br> safe in England...<br> ...and you've borne the voyage<br> like a seasoned traveler.<br> It's been a pleasant voyage.<br> Your kindness has done me good,<br> much good.<br> It's nice to be one's self again.<br> Believe me, Miss Manette,<br> I'm sorry the voyage is ending.<br> And I... I can't tell you how glad I am<br> your hatbox fell into the water at Calais.<br> Really, Mr. Darnay.<br> Oh, I only meant that rescuing it gave me<br> the opportunity to meet you and your father.<br> And it gave me the opportunity<br> to hear your instructive discourse...<br> ...on George Washington<br> and the rights of man.<br> Now you're making sport of me.<br> Oh, no, Mr. Darnay,<br> it was most edifying.<br> Ahoy, ashore.<br> - All right, hand me my luggage, my bag.<br> - Get back.<br> Sorry.<br> There we are. Hurry up, lad.<br> Good, that's it.<br> Bon voyage.<br> Barsad.<br> Now to find the carriage,<br> and then for London, eh, doctor?<br> I wonder, Miss Manette, if I may presume<br> to call upon you at your home?<br> On such short acquaintance?<br> Oh, Mr. Darnay.<br> Certainly a crossing from Calais in this fog<br> cannot be called short acquaintance.<br> Do let me see you again.<br> Lucie, dear, ready?<br> Yes, Father.<br> Thank you, Mr. Darnay,<br> for all your kindness.<br> - Goodbye then until Sunday.<br> - Sunday?<br> I told Father I was inviting you to sup<br> with us on Sunday at our house in Soho.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, young man, until Sunday.<br> Which one is Evremonde?<br> That's him there.<br> But he calls himself Darnay,<br> Charles Darnay.<br> I tell you, the marquis is going to make it<br> well worthwhile for the both of us.<br> Really, not working yet, Carton?<br> This is too much.<br> You've got to put your mind<br> on this case.<br> No, not possible.<br> They've got this Charles Darnay<br> up for treason.<br> I don't know Charles Darnay.<br> I hate treason, I hate Frenchmen...<br> For that matter, I hate Englishmen.<br> Yes, but Lorry<br> sent this case on to us...<br> ...with a special request<br> for all my consideration.<br> It's not my consideration he wants,<br> it's yours.<br> Why don't you give it to him.<br> Of course, I count on you<br> for a little help.<br> You don't need me.<br> You're the great barrister Stryver.<br> Stryver of the King's Bench Bar.<br> Well, if I am, it's due to perseverance.<br> I had to get into the front rank.<br> I wasn't born there, was I?<br> I use my brains.<br> - You use mine, you mean.<br> - Well, if I do, I pay you for it.<br> Well, not enough to justify<br> your interfering with my drinking.<br> But this is a treason case.<br> It's a matter of life and death.<br> Well, so is everything else. What of it?<br> Carton, I beg of you,<br> have a look at this brief.<br> Really, with a man's life in your hands,<br> how can you hesitate?<br> - I don't hesitate.<br> - But I tell you, Darnay is lost.<br> We have to find a way to counteract<br> the evidence...<br> ...of these witnesses, Barsad and Cly.<br> Barsad and Cly. Cly and Barsad.<br> Barsad and Cly.<br> A case like that<br> could be tried on mere sound.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Well, Barsad and Cly or Cly and Barsad...<br> ...by the very sound of their names,<br> by the build of their syllables...<br> ...are manifestly villains.<br> Just as the other fellow...<br> The... The defendant,<br> what was his name?<br> Darnay. Charles Darnay.<br> Equally, manifestly a gentleman.<br> But you can't convict a man on syllables,<br> on the sound of his name.<br> Barsad.<br> Barsad.<br> I seem to know that name.<br> Wasn't he involved in<br> a treason case once before?<br> Barsad. Yes, he was.<br> I believe we've uncovered<br> something here, Carton.<br> Well, Mr. Darnay, fate and Mr. Barsad<br> have it that I should handle your case.<br> Your life is in my hands.<br> I may lead you to fortune or the grave.<br> Who knows, and who cares?<br> I wish you'd stop drinking, or I wouldn't<br> give much for Mr. Darnay's fortune.<br> You know, I shouldn't wonder<br> but that Cruncher...<br> ...Jerry Cruncher,<br> knows this fellow Barsad.<br> I think I'll call on Jerry.<br> I can't have you hobnobbing<br> with a fellow like him.<br> Why, he's a grave robber.<br> Now, a man who employs me<br> shouldn't be a snob.<br> But he's a grave robber.<br> You don't discern the facts.<br> The very pith and marrow escape you.<br> Do you know the most interesting<br> thing to me?<br> Saving an innocent man<br> from a horrible death.<br> No. It's that Cruncher probably knows<br> the tavern that Barsad drinks at.<br> That means I can pursue this case<br> in a congenial atmosphere.<br> You're in luck, Stryver.<br> I'll lay you a wager.<br> I'll drink you a victory.<br> Oh, dear Lord,<br> don't let him be a grave robber.<br> Have mercy on us.<br> Don't let him be a grave robber.<br> Oh, dear God...<br> Bust me if she ain't at it again.<br> Flopping yourself down<br> and praying against my prosperity.<br> Oh, Jerry, how can I keep from praying...<br> ...now that I know<br> what your real business is?<br> Listen, Aggerawayter, I won't<br> have me wittles blessed off<br> me table by your praying.<br> A grave robber.<br> Don't say that word.<br> I'm a resurrectionist, that's what I am.<br> Doing a service for the medical profession,<br> besides making a bit of money for myself.<br> So that's why your fingers<br> is always rusty, Father.<br> Quiet, you.<br> You're an unnatural wife and<br> an unnatural mother, praying against me.<br> I wasn't praying against you,<br> I was praying for you.<br> And I tell you I won't be<br> took the liberty with.<br> You've got a fine mother, you have...<br> ...praying that the bread and butter<br> be snatched out of the mouth of her child.<br> Father, I think she's flopping again.<br> - What, more flopping?<br> - No, no, no. I was meditating.<br> And I won't have you meditating neither.<br> Prayed against and meditated against<br> in me own home.<br> Jerry.<br> - How are you, Mr. Carton?<br> - Not rusty, huh?<br> - Oh, no, sir.<br> - Good.<br> - You'll never see them rusty again.<br> - Jerry, do you know a man called Cly?<br> Cly? No, I don't believes I do, sir.<br> Know anybody called Barsad?<br> Oh, Barsad. I knows him, sir.<br> - A great fellow for bowling.<br> - Where do I find him?<br> You might find him<br> bowling down at Puffey's.<br> Good.<br> But if you're going to meet him...<br> ...you won't be keeping<br> very good company.<br> Neither will Mr. Barsad.<br> - Hey, whose idea was it?<br> - Mine.<br> I did all the brainwork.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Told them where to hold up the coach...<br> ...and when to shoot the coachman.<br> And after doing all that for them,<br> what do you think they did, Barsad?<br> Run away with the swag?<br> Oh, oh, Barsad, where did you<br> learn so much of human nature?<br> In a really hard school of experience.<br> I don't believe in nobody,<br> and I don't trust nobody.<br> That's right.<br> Made up my mind, same thing.<br> Nobody. Never trust nobody.<br> But them swine,<br> did you get back at them?<br> Did I get ba...?<br> Did I fix something up on them.<br> - Did you plant something on them?<br> - Plant...<br> Oh, you got a brain, Barsad.<br> - You got a brain.<br> - What did you plant on them?<br> If I tell you where I last saw them...<br> ...maybe you'll guess<br> what I planted on them.<br> Where did you see them?<br> Outside Newgate Prison.<br> Newgate?<br> With my own eyes.<br> First hung up and then quartered.<br> Drawn and quartered?<br> Like animals, drawn and quartered.<br> You guessed it, Barsad.<br> Now... Now, let that brain of yours...<br> ...work out what I planted on them.<br> Treason. You got them for treason.<br> You're a great man, Barsad.<br> You guessed it.<br> - Treason, eh?<br> - Now, Barsad, match that if you can!<br> Right. I will match it.<br> If you'll take the trouble<br> to go to the Old Bailey tomorrow...<br> ...you'll have the pleasure<br> of seeing a Frenchman...<br> ...by the name of Darnay, up for treason.<br> Put there by no other<br> than your humble servant.<br> No. Oh, if that's true,<br> I take my hat off to you, Barsad.<br> Then doff it right now.<br> - Wait till I tell you how I did it.<br> - No, another drink first.<br> - There's plenty of time.<br> - No, no. Now, let me tell you.<br> Now, Mr. Barsad, will you please<br> tell us, in your own way...<br> ...just what happened on the boat,<br> just how your attention was<br> attracted to the prisoner.<br> Well, sir, I was strolling about<br> having a bit of exercise...<br> ...when I passed a cabin door<br> which happened to be open.<br> I looked down, and I noticed<br> some papers on the floor.<br> I thought they might be valuable.<br> So, thinks I to myself:<br> "Here's my opportunity to do<br> a good turn for some poor chap. "<br> You know, I... I likes doing<br> that sort of thing.<br> Do not delay, my good man.<br> Just get to the incriminating facts.<br> Yes, milord.<br> I picked up the papers, and imagine<br> my astonishment when I discovered...<br> ...that they were lists<br> of His Majesty's forces, God bless him.<br> And what was your motive in turning<br> these papers over to the police?<br> - My duty, sir.<br> - Your duty to your country?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Your duty as a patriotic Englishman.<br> Your duty as a shining citizen.<br> I say, milord,<br> that were statues decreed in Britain...<br> ...as they were in ancient Greece<br> and Rome to public benefactors...<br> ...this noble citizen<br> would most assuredly have one.<br> Your Honor, I protest.<br> Must we have a statue or<br> would you be satisfied with just a bust?<br> Silence in court.<br> No levity, gentlemen.<br> That's all, Mr. Barsad.<br> Your witness.<br> "No questions now.<br> Later on, if you're<br> not too silly, we'll... "<br> No questions now. Beg pardon, milord.<br> Here are the lists,<br> if you care to examine them.<br> Have these been<br> in the prisoner's possession?<br> - Yes, milord.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> Can't be too careful, you know.<br> Jail fever. Very prevalent.<br> I now call Miss Lucie Manette.<br> Miss Manette,<br> have you seen the prisoner before?<br> Oh, most unhappily, yes.<br> Answer the questions put to you.<br> Make no remark upon them.<br> Where did you first meet him?<br> - When the gentleman came onboard, I...<br> - If you mean the prisoner,<br> say the prisoner.<br> The prisoner noticed that my father<br> was in a very weak state of health.<br> He was very kind and good to my father.<br> To us both.<br> I hope I won't repay him<br> by doing him harm today.<br> It's your duty to tell the truth,<br> the whole truth and nothing but.<br> The prisoner understands that, or should.<br> The prisoner was overheard<br> to make some remark about America.<br> What was it? Be particular.<br> He tried to explain to me<br> the quarrel between England and America...<br> ...and said that it might have been avoided<br> had England been more understanding.<br> - Oh, he made treasonable remarks like that?<br> - There was no harm in the way he said this.<br> - It was said only to beguile the time.<br> - We'll leave that for the jury to decide.<br> That will be all, Miss Manette.<br> Your witness.<br> No questions, milord.<br> With your permission, milord,<br> I'd like to call the witness, Barsad, again.<br> Mr. Barsad, did you discuss this case<br> with Mr. Cly last night?<br> Last night? Why, sir, I... I haven't seen<br> Mr. Cly since last Sunday's services.<br> Services. My guess is<br> he stole the collection box.<br> Where were you last night?<br> At home. Working.<br> Working, Mr. Barsad?<br> Just what is your profession?<br> - Gentleman.<br> - Retired, of course.<br> And on what do you live?<br> On my property.<br> Where is it?<br> Well, I... I haven't any just now.<br> Oh, then at present you're not living.<br> Silence in court.<br> Really, Mr. Stryver, I don't see that<br> these questions are at all relevant.<br> - Mr. Barsad, have you ever been kicked?<br> - Certainly not.<br> Come, come, Mr. Barsad.<br> Weren't you one time kicked down stairs?<br> Well, once I was kicked<br> at the top of the stairs...<br> ...but I fell down the stairs<br> of my own will and volition.<br> Wasn't that kick the result of<br> your stealing a silver teapot?<br> I was maligned about a mustard pot,<br> but it turned out to be only plated.<br> Oh, I see. You were maligned.<br> Do you know a French marquis?<br> - No, sir.<br> - No?<br> A relative of the prisoner's?<br> - No, sir.<br> - No?<br> And now, Mr. Barsad,<br> I want to ask you the vital question.<br> The attorney general has told us<br> that his whole case rests...<br> ...upon the identification of a certain man<br> whom you say is the prisoner.<br> A man whom you saw enter the cabin<br> on the Dover boat.<br> Now, I want you to be very, very careful.<br> After all, all we want is the truth.<br> Now, are you quite certain<br> that the man you saw was the prisoner?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Couldn't have made a mistake?<br> No, sir.<br> Couldn't have mistaken him for me,<br> for instance?<br> - Oh, no, sir.<br> - Or his lordship, perhaps?<br> Piffle.<br> No, sir.<br> Well then, could you have mistaken him<br> for my learned friend here?<br> Why...<br> Now you seem to think otherwise.<br> Will milord bid my learned friend<br> lay aside his wig for a minute?<br> I don't think it's necessary,<br> but if he doesn't mind...<br> ...and won't catch cold in his head.<br> Now, Mr. Barsad...<br> ...couldn't you have mistaken the prisoner<br> for Mr. Carton there?<br> No, I...<br> Well, sir, come to think of it,<br> as a matter of fact...<br> ...it was not the prisoner at all, sir.<br> That's all, milord.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> it's quite sufficient.<br> Gentlemen... the jury will retire<br> and consider their verdict.<br> I'll never understand how<br> you got him to change his evidence.<br> I just have a way of getting<br> at the essence of the facts.<br> - The pith and marrow, as it were.<br> - Oh, really?<br> Oh, yes, quite so, quite so.<br> Oh, Mr. Carton,<br> if you'll excuse me.<br> Charles... Mr. Darnay<br> will be acquitted, won't he?<br> If the jury understands evidence, Charles...<br> Mr. Darnay will be acquitted.<br> Mr. Stryver's defense was brilliant.<br> Wonderful. If he does get off...<br> ...it'll be entirely due<br> to Mr. Stryver, won't it?<br> Nothing to it. Mere professional claptrap.<br> Young sir, give credit<br> where credit is due.<br> Mr. Lorry, I would like Charles to know<br> we wish him well.<br> - Would you tell him for me?<br> - No, I better.<br> It wouldn't do for respectable businessmen,<br> especially bankers...<br> ...to be seen talking to the prisoner.<br> - Might tell against the prisoner.<br> - Yes. Upstart.<br> Silence in court.<br> Gentlemen of the jury,<br> have you agreed upon your verdict?<br> - We have.<br> - What is your verdict?<br> Not guilty.<br> The prisoner at the bar,<br> the jury has found you not guilty.<br> Prisoner dismissed.<br> I'm so glad.<br> So very glad.<br> Charles. Charles, my boy.<br> - Glad to have got you off with honor.<br> - You saved my life.<br> Never any other outcome possible.<br> Barsad and Cly. Cly and Barsad.<br> I could have told from<br> the sound of their names...<br> ...from the very run of the syllables,<br> that they were...<br> Well, anyway, it was<br> all very simple, really.<br> Well, Mr. Stryver,<br> shows you can't tell brains by appearance.<br> Barsad.<br> As between fellow artists,<br> why not try another country?<br> Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Carton,<br> I think I should love to travel.<br> Perhaps France.<br> Or you might like to go even further,<br> say, China.<br> Never trust nobody.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Miss Manette.<br> My boy, never for a moment<br> did I doubt your innocence.<br> So, Mr. Lorry, respectable men of business<br> may speak to Mr. Darnay in public...<br> ...now he's acquitted.<br> - You mentioned that before.<br> We men of business must think of<br> the house we serve more than ourselves.<br> Yes, yes. Banking, of course,<br> imposes its own restrictions and silences.<br> And indeed, sir, I don't know<br> that it is any of your business.<br> - I have no business.<br> - And if you had, sir...<br> ...perhaps you would attend to it.<br> - Lord, love you, no, I wouldn't.<br> Mr. Darnay,<br> you're a very fortunate young man.<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> Well, it's not long since you were well<br> advanced on your way to another world.<br> I'm... I'm very grateful to Mr. Stryver<br> and to you.<br> Would you...?<br> Would you care to dine with me?<br> No, I don't dine,<br> but I'll wine with you.<br> Well, Mr. Darnay...<br> ...how does it feel to belong<br> to this terrestrial scheme again...<br> ...to taste, to feel, to be alive?<br> It's very agreeable.<br> - I'm glad you find it so.<br> - Why, don't you?<br> I?<br> Matter of fact, Mr. Darnay,<br> I care for no man...<br> ...and no man cares for me.<br> You seem to be rather bitter today.<br> I suppose you were up all night.<br> - All night.<br> - No sleep, I'll wager.<br> - Not a wink.<br> - Just drinking.<br> Very sad. Just drinking.<br> For no reason?<br> For no reason.<br> Well, pardon me, but...<br> But why do it?<br> You are smug, Mr. Darnay,<br> when you ask why people drink...<br> ...but I'll tell you.<br> So that they can stand<br> their fellow men better.<br> After a few bottles<br> I might even like you.<br> You've been kind to me, and<br> I'll not reward you by taking offense.<br> There's a good fellow.<br> A toast then. Let's drink a toast. Drink...<br> ...to the person<br> that's nearest your heart.<br> - To the person...?<br> - The one you're thinking of.<br> - But I don't know...<br> - Come now, man...<br> ...it's on the tip of your tongue.<br> Very well. To Miss Manette.<br> Miss Manette.<br> There's a fair young lady to hand<br> to a coach in the dark.<br> There's a fair young lady to be pitied by<br> and wept for by.<br> Must be worth being tried for one's life...<br> ...to be the object of such sympathy<br> and compassion.<br> Well, Miss Manette.<br> Oh, waiter, glass.<br> Tell me, Mr. Darnay,<br> do you think I particularly like you?<br> - I've not asked myself that question.<br> - Well, ask it now.<br> I thought you did,<br> but you're acting now as if you don't.<br> I begin to have a better opinion<br> of your understanding.<br> Waiter.<br> There is nothing to prevent<br> my settling for the dinner.<br> - Oh, nothing in the world.<br> - Let me have the record.<br> - You call the...? The whole dinner?<br> - I do.<br> In that case, waiter, another bottle.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> Good night.<br> And don't let your sober face elate you.<br> You never know what it may come to.<br> Why treat the fellow like that?<br> Is it because he shows you<br> what you have fallen away from...<br> ...what you might have been?<br> Change places with him.<br> Would you have been looked at<br> by those blue eyes as he was?<br> Come on, Carton, you're jealous.<br> Have it out in plain words.<br> You hate the fellow.<br> I've got to be getting home.<br> Christmas, you know.<br> Home? Where can you better find<br> the spirit of Christmas...<br> ...than a good old English tavern?<br> But a tavern ain't a home.<br> No, at home you bicker and quarrel.<br> And here, it's all peace on Earth,<br> good will to men.<br> Drink up, gentlemen. Good will to men.<br> Merry Christmas!<br> Really, what can be keeping Mr. Darnay?<br> A man who would be late for Christmas<br> services would be late for his own wedding.<br> Charles told me he had to see<br> Mr. Lorry about something.<br> Important indeed.<br> Anything can be more important<br> to a young man than going to church.<br> For myself, I'm very sorry to see Mr. Darnay<br> go into Mr. Lorry's bank.<br> You all think it was a great kindness<br> on Mr. Lorry's part, but I don't...<br> ...because I think Mr. Lorry is an atheist.<br> All bankers are atheists.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Darnay.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Merry Christmas, Charles.<br> - Merry Christmas, Lucie.<br> Merry Christmas, Miss Pross,<br> Dr. Manette.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> We've been waiting for you.<br> Will you forgive me<br> if I don't go to church?<br> I must speak to your father about...<br> - About something that has arisen.<br> - You're worried.<br> Oh, it's nothing serious, Lucie.<br> - Lf only I could speak to Dr. Manette.<br> - Certainly.<br> Mr. Lorry has sent Jerry Cruncher<br> to light you to the church.<br> We'll come back directly after the service.<br> You'll wait for us?<br> - Yes, I...<br> - Well, come along, Lucie.<br> Not going to church, indeed. Atheist.<br> Bankers and Frenchmen, all atheists.<br> May I remind you<br> that the port on the sideboard...<br> ...is for the party after services<br> and not for haphazard consumption.<br> Oh, Pross, do come along.<br> Won't you sit down, Charles.<br> I will not delay disclosing to you<br> what I have to say, Dr. Manette.<br> I have just learned from Mr. Lorry<br> something that distresses me deeply.<br> It is a bitter irony, sir...<br> ...that this man,<br> who did you such a dreadful injustice...<br> ...should be my blood relation.<br> I'm very sorry.<br> Can you understand that I...?<br> That I had to tell you?<br> Yes, I understand you had to tell me.<br> I am an Evremonde,<br> but I love you and yours.<br> For you and Lucie I would give up my life,<br> if necessary.<br> Dr. Manette, can you find it<br> in your heart to forgive me?<br> You showed character, Charles,<br> in coming to me.<br> And I have no blame for you.<br> In suffering, one learns many things.<br> Among them,<br> not to punish the innocent.<br> I shall never forget your kindness.<br> - But you must promise me one thing.<br> - Anything.<br> - You must not tell Lucie.<br> - But I must. That would be...<br> You must let me tell her in my own way,<br> in my own time...<br> ...or you may spoil not only<br> your own happiness, but hers.<br> Trust me, Charles.<br> I don't like Mr. Lorry sending dozens<br> of people to look after us we don't want.<br> If he's so anxious about us,<br> why didn't he come himself?<br> Oh, no, not himself, the old atheist.<br> Now, you know perfectly well<br> Mr. Lorry is the soul of kindness.<br> - Mr. Cruncher is his odd-job man.<br> - Odd-job man, indeed.<br> From what I can gather,<br> he's the oddest of odd-job men.<br> Wait.<br> Good evening, Mr. Carton.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Thank you, Miss Manette.<br> Miss Pross, merry Christmas.<br> I'd say merry Christmas to you,<br> Mr. Carton...<br> ...if it weren't plain to see<br> that you'd already had it.<br> Were you going to midnight service?<br> We're going. Do come with us.<br> Why not? Thank you, Miss Manette.<br> It's dangerous taking him to church,<br> Miss Pross.<br> He'll forget where he is<br> and call for a round of drinks.<br> Hold your tongue and hold that lantern<br> higher, or I'll bash you with this umbrella.<br> I'll light a candle for you.<br> Go along, my man. And I hope<br> you mend your ways in the future.<br> Lucie, my pet,<br> your father's waiting for you.<br> And as you know,<br> he doesn't like crowds of people about...<br> ...especially on Christmas Eve.<br> Please tell him I'll come in<br> in just a moment.<br> Won't you come in too?<br> - We're having a little<br> Christmas celebration.<br> - Oh, I'm afraid not.<br> - Thank you, Miss Manette.<br> - You'll be very welcome.<br> I must tell you, Miss Manette, that when<br> you met me, I wasn't on my way to church.<br> I know.<br> My usual Christmas Eve,<br> going from tavern to tavern.<br> Well, I know, but... Well, we...<br> We can't always be at our best.<br> Won't you please come in?<br> Not like this.<br> If I may come some other time.<br> Please do.<br> I'd love to have you for a friend.<br> So... So would Father.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> You're making quite a tea drinker<br> out of me, Prossie. Aren't you ashamed?<br> I am Miss Pross. And as for being ashamed,<br> why should I be ashamed?<br> For giving you a decent home<br> to come to, I suppose.<br> For saving you<br> from the gallows, practically.<br> - Ashamed... indeed.<br> - Oh, Miss Pross...<br> ...don't you think, at times, you're<br> inclined to exaggerate just a trifle?<br> One of Prossie's most endearing gifts.<br> That's why I love you.<br> I'll have you know, I'm not<br> one of those flibbertigibbeties<br> you can take liberties with.<br> No more liberties, Prossie.<br> And I'll thank you to call me Miss Pross<br> or not address me at all.<br> You know, I believe you've completely<br> captivated Pross.<br> She's part of the flavor<br> of this house to me.<br> I couldn't imagine it without her, no more<br> than without these paintings of yours.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - Please don't look at it.<br> I know it's dreadful, but I do it.<br> That's like my drinking.<br> I know it's dreadful, but I do it.<br> There hasn't been quite so much<br> of that lately, has there?<br> With your influence...<br> Your visits here have meant so much to us,<br> to Father and me.<br> What do you think it's meant to me,<br> being able to come here and see you?<br> - Oh, if we've helped you, I'm glad.<br> - It's you. It's you who have done it.<br> I've always felt in you<br> such hidden possibilities.<br> - It seems such a pity to...<br> - To waste them? Don't be afraid to say it.<br> I have wasted them and myself.<br> It's only now, after knowing you...<br> ...that I've told myself that perhaps<br> it's not too late.<br> I'm sure it's not.<br> After all, you're young.<br> Your whole life's before you.<br> - Anything you want to accomplish...<br> - Do you believe that?<br> Oh, I do.<br> - It makes it worth the trying.<br> - Thank you, Sydney.<br> That completes my happiness.<br> I wonder if you know how much<br> your happiness means to me.<br> Oh, of course I do.<br> You're my very dearest friend.<br> I must tell you.<br> What?<br> - Can't you guess?<br> - Guess?<br> I'm going to be married.<br> Charles Darnay.<br> Yes.<br> Aren't you going to wish me happiness?<br> Happiness, yes. Yes, of course.<br> All that you deserve.<br> Amen.<br> I join you together in marriage...<br> ...in the name of the Father, and of the<br> Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.<br> And now, for the first time, Mrs. Darnay.<br> All my congratulations, Dr. Manette.<br> Dear, dear. This is an occasion...<br> ...that makes me speculate<br> on all I may have lost.<br> To think there might have been<br> a Mrs. Lorry any time these 50 years.<br> You were a bachelor in your cradle.<br> You were cut out for a bachelor<br> before you were put in your cradle.<br> I may have been so in my cradle,<br> but since then, let me tell you...<br> ...there have been occasions...<br> - Mr. Lorry.<br> This is not the time or place<br> for such confidences.<br> But...<br> - Charles, have you seen Sydney?<br> - Why, no.<br> Well, I wonder why he didn't<br> come to my wedding.<br> Why, Sydney, why didn't you<br> come to the wedding?<br> Pleasant ceremonies, weddings.<br> You know, Sydney, come to think of it,<br> you ought to get married.<br> Find yourself someone<br> to take care of you...<br> ...some respectable woman<br> with a little property.<br> Landlady, lodging-house keeper.<br> Marry her against a rainy day.<br> Oh, must I spend my life listening to that<br> eternal blithering, pompous voice of yours?<br> Drives me mad.<br> You certainly are a funny fellow.<br> Never know how to take you.<br> Suggest marriage to you, and you fly up.<br> If you'd only seen<br> the joy in Lucie's eyes...<br> Why should that surprise me?<br> Why shouldn't she be happy?<br> Why shouldn't she be?<br> You are destined for more, Gaspard,<br> than revenge for the murder of your child.<br> You may light a spark<br> that will kindle all France.<br> I go.<br> He goes.<br> - "Henri Dupont, 42 francs, quit rental. "<br> - Not enough, Gabelle.<br> With what I get from these peasants,<br> I can hardly afford to pay my perfume bills.<br> - What about Roulet? Has he paid his rent?<br> - No, Your Excellency, nor will he.<br> Roulet died last week.<br> Now, that was impertinent of him.<br> He died with his rent unpaid.<br> - Oh, what did he die of?<br> - Hunger.<br> Hunger is an indulgence<br> with these peasants...<br> ...as gout is with us.<br> It is an indulgence they would gladly<br> dispense with, Monseigneur.<br> Oh, I keep forgetting, Gabelle. You're a...<br> You're a humanitarian, aren't you?<br> You think that one person<br> is as good as another.<br> A naive notion,<br> so contradicted by the facts.<br> But speaking of...<br> Speaking of humanitarians...<br> ...what has become of your disciple,<br> my nephew...<br> ...in the year since he left<br> my tyrannical roof?<br> - Do you hear from him, Gabelle?<br> - Oh, yes. He is very happy.<br> He has taken a post at Tellson's Bank.<br> Frightfully bourgeois.<br> If it weren't that my sister, Charles'<br> mother, were quite beyond reproach...<br> ...I should suspect that Charles<br> had tainted blood somewhere.<br> His conduct is so strange.<br> It's quite mystifying.<br> What was that, Gabelle?<br> What, Your Excellency?<br> I thought I saw somebody<br> at the window. Go and see.<br> Certainly.<br> There was nothing, Monseigneur.<br> Good night.<br> Gentlemen. Monsieur Gabelle.<br> Your forgiveness, gentlemen.<br> I'm certain you wouldn't have me<br> put promptness before gallantry.<br> It's of no consequence.<br> Believe me, no consequence.<br> Monsieur Gabelle here has been<br> trying to frighten us...<br> ...with hobgoblins, werewolves<br> and mythical revolutionists.<br> Proceed, Monsieur Gabelle.<br> You may laugh, gentlemen,<br> but revolution is in the air.<br> Yet there is still time to remove<br> the cause of this unrest.<br> All the people ask is justice.<br> Only the Jacquerie, the extremists...<br> ...are spreading the doctrine<br> of violence and bloodshed.<br> And what do you suggest, Gabelle?<br> That we double the police force?<br> Double the police? No.<br> Give the people bread.<br> Reduce their taxes.<br> Oh, I... I beseech you,<br> gentlemen, correct your errors<br> or the flood will come...<br> ...a flood that may sweep us all<br> away forever.<br> His terror is genuine, gentlemen,<br> even if his philosophy is not.<br> Remember your own terror five years ago<br> when my master met his death?<br> And remember also, gentlemen, that the<br> Jacques who killed him is still at liberty.<br> Enough of this, Gabelle.<br> I have a new agent in Paris...<br> ...a smart Englishman,<br> who will ferret out this murderer.<br> Our gracious king also has seen<br> the necessity for stronger measures.<br> He has brought German hussars<br> and Swiss infantry into Paris...<br> ...to give your Jacques' a good drubbing,<br> Monsieur Gabelle.<br> Mercenaries to fight Frenchmen?<br> More delicate than to slaughter them<br> ourselves, don't you think?<br> Shall we rejoin the ladies, gentlemen?<br> How I loathe intellectuals<br> like this fellow, peasants who read.<br> I think he's right about the peasants.<br> How many thousands of these<br> foreign soldiers are they bringing in?<br> It doesn't matter how many.<br> It will do them no good.<br> It'll do them no good.<br> The starving people of Paris<br> might wait a long time...<br> ...before rising up<br> to fight French soldiers.<br> But against hired foreign troops...<br> ...any day, any hour.<br> - Any minute.<br> Want this wood in the loft?<br> Aristo spy. Used to be with Evremonde.<br> Name is Barsad.<br> Good day.<br> Cognac, the very best.<br> Never mind the cost.<br> These foreign soldiers are gonna fi...<br> They march well, don't they?<br> Very well.<br> You knit with great skill, madam.<br> What sort of things do you make?<br> Everything, mostly shrouds.<br> Shrouds?<br> - Business seems bad.<br> - Business is very bad.<br> People are so poor.<br> The unfortunate, miserable people.<br> And so oppressed too, as you say.<br> As you say.<br> Pardon me.<br> Certainly it was I who said so...<br> ...but of course, naturally you think so.<br> - I think?<br> All we think here is how to live.<br> Good health, Jacques.<br> My name is Ernest De Farge.<br> De Farge?<br> Didn't you used to work for Dr. Manette?<br> - Yes.<br> - You know, I met him in England.<br> He has a charming daughter.<br> Little grandchild now too.<br> - Grandchild?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> His daughter married Charles Darnay.<br> You must remember him.<br> He's the nephew<br> of the Marquis St. Evremonde.<br> You must have known the marquis.<br> No. Why should I?<br> Well, when the marquis was killed<br> some years ago...<br> ...his death was applauded<br> in this neighborhood.<br> You remember that, Jacques?<br> You make a mistake<br> when you call my husband Jacques.<br> His name is Ernest.<br> I don't want to make<br> a mistake in your name.<br> Are there two Ds in Barsad?<br> I don't believe it.<br> It can't be true...<br> ...what he said of Mademoiselle Manette.<br> - No.<br> If he has said it, it's probably false...<br> ...but it may be true.<br> - No, no, it's not true.<br> If it is, I hope for her sake that destiny<br> will keep her husband out of France.<br> Her husband's destiny will lead him<br> to the end that is to end him.<br> - That is to end him.<br> - I can't understand the doctor...<br> ...permitting such a marriage.<br> - Or forgetting what the Evremondes did.<br> The doctor may forget,<br> and the doctor may forgive, but I don't.<br> We don't.<br> I don't believe there will be<br> a terror in France.<br> I count on the people's sanity<br> and good temper.<br> Well, the trouble is,<br> the aristocrats weren't firm enough.<br> They should hang hoodlums and that's all<br> the revolution there will be.<br> That's the kind of talk that cost us<br> the American colonies.<br> No comparison at all that I can see.<br> None. We lost the colonies because they fell<br> under the spell of that upstart Washington.<br> Well, the time may come<br> when the upstart Washington...<br> ...will be a better remembered<br> Englishman than George III.<br> Oh, stuff and nonsense.<br> You businessmen never read anything<br> but your ledgers. You're badly informed.<br> - Oh, bless my soul.<br> - And as for the French aristocrats...<br> ...they're so blind they can't see<br> the lightning in front of their eyes.<br> You mustn't make the mistake of thinking<br> that all aristocrats are alike.<br> - They differ as other classes do.<br> - I agree.<br> We of the younger generation<br> of Tellson's Bank...<br> ...have been studying<br> the French situation closely.<br> - And we have come to the conclusion...<br> - Oh, Miss Pross...<br> ...may I congratulate you on the dinner.<br> I know I express the sentiments of all<br> when I say that the roast tonight...<br> Is not up to your usual standard.<br> I suppose it not as good<br> as the taverns you are used to.<br> From what I hear, none of you<br> are strangers to taverns.<br> Mr. Carton, the infant has expressed<br> a desire to say good night to you.<br> The infant's desire shall be<br> gratified immediately, Prossie.<br> I suppose it's none of my business...<br> ...but I wouldn't allow that fellow<br> to handle a child of mine.<br> As to that, you haven't got one.<br> And by the looks of you, you're not likely<br> to have one. Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> She wanted so badly to say<br> good night to you, but she fell asleep.<br> You're her favorite, Sydney.<br> And she's mine.<br> She accepts me without criticism.<br> Never asks me where I've been<br> or what I've been doing.<br> Doesn't even object to my drinking.<br> The perfect friend.<br> You know, Sydney, sometimes<br> it's the part of a friend to criticize too.<br> Well, when there's any hope of reformation,<br> yes. But with me it's hopeless.<br> I don't believe it. I refuse to believe it.<br> Oh, I admit that once when...<br> When I first knew you,<br> the sight of you and your home...<br> ...stirred old shadows<br> that I thought had died out of me.<br> I had unformed ideas of striving afresh...<br> ...beginning anew,<br> fighting out the abandoned fight.<br> A dream that ended in nothing,<br> but you inspired it.<br> Must it end in nothing?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> But for that inspiration<br> and for that dream...<br> ...I shall always be grateful<br> to you, Lucie.<br> I feel in you still such possibilities.<br> No, they'll never be realized.<br> I am like one who died young.<br> I'll never give up my hopes<br> for you, Sydney. Never.<br> I know myself better.<br> But this I know too:<br> I would embrace any sacrifice for you...<br> ...and for those dear to you.<br> Will you hold me in your mind as being<br> ardent and sincere in this one thing?<br> Think now and then that there is a man<br> who would give his life...<br> ...to keep a life you love beside you.<br> Thank you, Sydney.<br> God grant it may never be necessary.<br> Look at the crowd rushing<br> to escape the storm.<br> Listen to the echoes.<br> You know...<br> ...sometimes I've sat here<br> of an evening until...<br> Until I've made the echoes<br> out to be the echoes...<br> ...of all the footsteps that are coming<br> by and by into my father's life and mine.<br> - Meat.<br> - Yes, meat.<br> - Stop it.<br> - Stop it.<br> Why do you endure it?<br> Why do you have to endure it?<br> Why?<br> Why?<br> Careful.<br> - Aristos.<br> - Children of aristos.<br> - Evremonde's lackey.<br> - Living on the blood of peasants.<br> It's not true.<br> I've always fought for the people.<br> I taught Charles Darnay<br> to love the people. Ask him.<br> - Then why isn't he here?<br> - Why isn't he here to testify for you?<br> Citizen Gabelle...<br> ...we know Citizen Darnay's views,<br> that he's a friend of the people.<br> - His word could save you.<br> - But he's in England.<br> Why doesn't he return to testify for you?<br> Lf, as you say, you have taught him<br> the views he holds...<br> ...he should be willing<br> to do that for you.<br> Write him.<br> His answer will be the test.<br> He will come.<br> I'm sure he will.<br> Pen. Paper.<br> Thank you, Citizen Gabelle.<br> Thanks for giving us an aristocrat.<br> His last will and testament.<br> I congratulate you<br> on your ruse, citizens...<br> ...but I beg of you, I implore you...<br> ...no matter what you do to me,<br> spare Charles Darnay.<br> He is your friend.<br> The revolution will need friends.<br> Remember a child that was killed<br> by the coach of your master...<br> ...the Marquis Evremonde?<br> Why, yes.<br> Was that your child?<br> - My child.<br> - Oh, that was a dreadful thing, citizen.<br> Do you see this hand? This is the hand<br> that struck your master down.<br> - Well, you can't blame me.<br> - You lived with him. You're his friend.<br> I see.<br> I'll not plead for justice for myself...<br> ...but I implore you<br> not to send that letter.<br> Charles Darnay is your friend.<br> He feels your sufferings.<br> He will feel them better and so will you.<br> Hurry up, you.<br> Come on here with that there mail.<br> What's been keeping you?<br> What's all the row, Father?<br> Lots of foreigners about today.<br> Frenchies over here to save<br> their heads and skins.<br> From what I hear, France would be a fine<br> place just now for a resurrectionist.<br> You're developing too fast, me lad.<br> And stay off my stool.<br> So we landed here without a silver...<br> - Letter for you, Mr. Darnay.<br> - Thank you, Jerry.<br> Where do I arrange for a loan?<br> Understand, I want this loan<br> on the house in the Rue St. Germain.<br> Everything will be attended to,<br> but it takes time.<br> - You can't hurry this house.<br> - I demand immediate action.<br> My dear sir, young Mr. Tellson<br> will see you, but you'll have to wait.<br> - I want to see old Mr. Tellson.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Mr. Tellson Sr. Hasn't<br> seen anyone in 15 years.<br> But here comes Mr. Tellson Jr.<br> Mr. Tellson, sir. Aren't you going to pay<br> any attention to my loan?<br> Indubitably.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> If you advise the bank to loan money<br> to these aristocrats...<br> ...you'll ruin Tellson's.<br> - This is the best opportunity...<br> ...for business in years.<br> These people are so anxious to get loans,<br> they'll put up twice the value for security.<br> Seems twice the value to you,<br> but it's no security at all.<br> This business in France<br> is a real revolution.<br> These people are putting up securities<br> they won't own.<br> I was thinking along<br> those same lines myself.<br> - Well, Darnay.<br> - Hello, Carton.<br> - Lucie still in the country?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> You seem upset. Is everything all right?<br> Yes, of course.<br> Mr. Stryver, you see<br> we are besieged for loans.<br> Our Mr. Lorry is in Paris<br> reviewing the situation.<br> Advices are delayed.<br> Shall we advance any money at all,<br> Mr. Stryver?<br> I shouldn't.<br> This is a real revolution in France,<br> Mr. Tellson...<br> ...and these securities, in my opinion,<br> are no securities at all.<br> - Don't you think so, Carton?<br> - Indubitably.<br> Well, Mr. Carton, even though<br> you do agree with Mr. Stryver...<br> ...I shall still risk his judgment.<br> Good day, sir.<br> - Jerry.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - When does the coach leave for Dover?<br> - In half an hour, from<br> the Golden Cross Inn.<br> - Does it meet the packet for France?<br> - Yes.<br> - Reserve space for me<br> immediately, will you?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> "I know you will understand<br> my obligation to my old tutor.<br> His life is at stake<br> and I cannot deny his appeal. "<br> Isn't that just like Charles...<br> ...to drop everything<br> and go to the aid of...<br> Father, what is it? What's the matter?<br> I should have told you before,<br> perhaps, Lucie.<br> - What?<br> - About Charles.<br> He is an Evremonde, nephew<br> of the notorious Marquis St. Evremonde.<br> The man who...?<br> Father, the same man who...?<br> Yes, it was Charles' uncle<br> who had me imprisoned in the Bastille.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> That is all past.<br> It is the present that troubles me.<br> - Charles' danger.<br> - Danger?<br> I heard only today that they've passed<br> a new law in France...<br> ...that the lives of all aristocrats<br> who return to France...<br> ...are forfeit to the revolution.<br> What are we going to do?<br> - We must follow him.<br> - Yes. Yes, of course we must.<br> Miss Pross.<br> - Father, I'm frightened.<br> - Yes, madame?<br> - Send Miss Pross to me.<br> - Yes, madame.<br> You needn't be frightened.<br> As a victim of the aristocrats,<br> I shall be welcome in France.<br> Yes. Yes, of course you will be.<br> How strange that I,<br> who suffered by an Evremonde...<br> ...must go to save an Evremonde.<br> Come, Father.<br> Charles Darnay?<br> Pass, Evremonde.<br> - Take Evremonde to La Force Prison.<br> - Take him away.<br> Wait. Prison? Under what law?<br> For what offense?<br> We have new laws, Evremonde,<br> and new offenses since you were here.<br> But isn't there...?<br> Will you...?<br> Will you permit me to communicate<br> with Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank...<br> ...who is now in Paris?<br> I will do nothing for you.<br> Take him away.<br> - Can he see us, Father?<br> - I'm sure he can.<br> You may kiss your hand towards<br> that highest row of windows up there.<br> I do so, and I send my soul with it.<br> Goodbye, my dear. I must go now<br> and try to arrange for Charles' trial.<br> If he sees us,<br> why doesn't he come down?<br> He will, darling...<br> ...if we wait long enough.<br> Mummy, something white up there.<br> Yes, darling, he sees us. Wave.<br> Former Count D'Etournelle,<br> anything to say in your defense?<br> Nothing I could say<br> would make any impression on you.<br> I prefer the dignity of silence.<br> He prefers the dignity of silence.<br> Vote, jury.<br> - Guilty.<br> - Guilty.

Pass.<br> But it's incredible that the<br> De Farges should have turned<br> against Manette like that.<br> He regarded them<br> as his best friends in Paris.<br> Every revolution breeds fanatics<br> like Madame De Farge...<br> ...but how anyone could be cruel<br> to Lucie I cannot understand.<br> Tell me, how is she?<br> How do you imagine she is<br> with her husband condemned to die?<br> Why do you take up my time<br> asking these questions?<br> What...? What good are these questions?<br> Forgive me if I notice<br> you are affected.<br> I shouldn't respect your sorrow more<br> if you were my own father.<br> From that misfortune, however,<br> you are free.<br> Indeed, that is one thing<br> to be grateful for, I suppose.<br> When is the...?<br> The execution to take place?<br> Within 24 hours.<br> You're remaining long in Paris?<br> No, I've done all the good I can do here.<br> You're going to Lucie's, I hope.<br> She must be very desolate tonight.<br> And she has such a strong attachment<br> to you and reliance on you.<br> I'll be going directly.<br> I shall venture to go and see her later.<br> Perhaps there is something<br> she would like me to do for her.<br> There's nothing for you to do<br> that I can see.<br> I shall let her tell me so.<br> Perhaps we shall meet at Lucie's then.<br> Perhaps.<br> Hello, Mr. Carton. How are you?<br> Hello, Jerry.<br> Better than the stool I had<br> in London, eh, Mr. Carton?<br> Belonged to a duke, they say.<br> I paid two shillings for it.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I arrived with documents for Mr. Lorry.<br> So I'm going to stay here<br> and do his errands like I did at home.<br> I suppose you heard about Mr. Darnay?<br> - Yes.<br> - Very sad.<br> You know, that couldn't happen<br> in England, Mr. Carton.<br> The other day,<br> I was talking about this case...<br> ...with an old friend<br> of yours, Mr. Barsad.<br> - Is he here in Paris?<br> - Is he here? And very important.<br> He goes in and out of prisons<br> as if he was high and mighty.<br> - He goes in any place.<br> - He does, does he?<br> If you ask me,<br> I think he's a sort of official...<br> ...a spy of the prisons.<br> And he's very prosperous, is Barsad.<br> Whatever you say about him,<br> he's talented.<br> Put him anywhere, he'll get along.<br> You say a spy on prisons,<br> what prison, for example?<br> - Mostly La Force Prison.<br> - La Force.<br> That information may be useful.<br> - Good, sir.<br> - All right, Jerry.<br> Glad to see you sitting<br> on the last throne left in Paris.<br> - Very fitting.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I implore you to have pity on me.<br> You have such power.<br> It is still not too late for you to help me.<br> As a wife and mother, I appeal to you.<br> We are wives and mothers,<br> and did they think of us?<br> All our lives we suffered,<br> and our children suffered...<br> ...poverty and nakedness,<br> hunger, sickness, death.<br> No one showed us mercy.<br> Why should the troubles of one wife<br> and mother mean anything to us now?<br> But I am not an aristocrat.<br> I'm the daughter of a country doctor.<br> - I'm one of the people, just as you are.<br> - I don't trust those members...<br> ...of the people who marry aristocrats.<br> I see that I can hope<br> for nothing from you.<br> You have no pity, no pity.<br> No, citizeness, none.<br> I'll thank you to leave the child alone.<br> And what's more,<br> don't grin at me, boldface.<br> Yes, there are still Evremondes.<br> Here, Ladybird, drink this.<br> No.<br> Sydney, there is still hope, isn't there?<br> - You think so, don't you?<br> - Of course there's hope.<br> But Father's been gone for hours.<br> It might take a long time<br> to see a man so important as Danton.<br> - He would be able to see him, wouldn't he?<br> - Sure.<br> Your father's reputation<br> would affect that easily.<br> And Danton could save him<br> if he wanted to, couldn't he?<br> Yes, Danton could save him.<br> Where did you get this, Lucie?<br> A nice old lady gave it to me<br> at the wine shop.<br> What wine shop<br> is the child talking about?<br> The D... The Defarge's.<br> We went there to...<br> You mean to say<br> that the De Farges saw the child?<br> Merciful heaven.<br> What is it? Why are you whispering?<br> Father.<br> Father.<br> Have you...? Have you seen him?<br> Have you seen Danton?<br> What...?<br> What name did you say?<br> Dan...<br> My work...<br> What have you done with my work?<br> My bench, tools, thread.<br> - Haven't you any thread?<br> - Father...<br> ...have you seen him?<br> You left to see Danton.<br> How can I make my shoes<br> if you don't give me any thread?<br> Father. Don't you know me?<br> Charles. You left to save Charles.<br> It's no use, my dear.<br> He doesn't understand you.<br> I'll take him to his room.<br> Not just now.<br> Say it.<br> Why not say it?<br> There's no hope now.<br> Where is Father? Didn't you say<br> he was going to bring back Father?<br> He's been delayed. He'll be here soon.<br> I want my father.<br> Come with Pross. Come, come.<br> I want my father.<br> It's going to seem<br> such a long time, Sydney.<br> Afterwards...<br> If only I could see him.<br> Just once.<br> I can't even do that.<br> Lucie, your father's calling for you.<br> Is there nothing we can do?<br> I think... I know I can get<br> to see Charles once.<br> You can? How?<br> Oh, I know of a man.<br> A way we drinking fellows have,<br> we always know of a man.<br> I spent the afternoon with him.<br> But what earthly good would it do<br> if you did see him?<br> You have your permit to leave Paris?<br> Yes.<br> And Lucie and the doctor, Miss Pross<br> and Jerry, they have theirs.<br> Oh, you'd have to move fast.<br> But why? These passes<br> are valid for any time.<br> - Until canceled.<br> - Canceled?<br> From what you've told<br> of Madame De Farge...<br> ...the permits will be canceled.<br> - But the doctor, Lucie,<br> they're in no danger.<br> They are in great danger.<br> The doctor is suspected.<br> His behavior at the trial.<br> It's death for anyone<br> to sympathize with the condemned.<br> And to that tiger, Madame De Farge,<br> even the child...<br> Little Lucie? It's unthinkable.<br> Look. Take the doctor's permit...<br> ...and the others.<br> And here's mine.<br> Keep it for me until tomorrow.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - Do as I ask.<br> Take the word<br> of a drinking man for once.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> At 8:00 tomorrow...<br> ...have your horses ready.<br> Start definitely at 8.<br> If Lucie hesitates, you must force her.<br> Tell her that it's Darnay's wish...<br> ...that she leave Paris<br> before the execution.<br> Do I wait for you?<br> Wait for nothing<br> but to have my place occupied.<br> And then for England.<br> You don't wish to tell me<br> anything more?<br> Carton...<br> ...if I've misunderstood you before,<br> believe me, I regret it.<br> You never misunderstood me, sir.<br> You were right.<br> Yours is a long life<br> to look back on, Mr. Lorry.<br> I'm 78.<br> Long life. Useful one.<br> Solitary bachelor.<br> Nobody will weep for me.<br> Wouldn't she weep for you?<br> Yes, thank God.<br> I didn't quite mean what I said.<br> It is a thing to thank God for, isn't it?<br> Tell me, if you looked back<br> on that long life...<br> ...and saw that you had gained<br> neither love...<br> ...gratitude nor respect<br> of any human being...<br> ...it would be a bitter reflection,<br> wouldn't it?<br> Why, yes, surely.<br> Would you mind if I borrowed that coat?<br> Certainly not.<br> Don't let anything she may say<br> change your plans.<br> I hope to do my part faithfully.<br> And I hope to do mine.<br> - Good night, Louis.<br> - Good night.<br> Sleep well. Pleasant dreams.<br> Hey there.<br> You work late, Mr. Barsad.<br> Now, Mr. Carton,<br> what is it you want, sir?<br> You know what I want.<br> Mr. Carton, I told you this afternoon<br> that it can't be done.<br> No one's ever escaped<br> from one of them prisons.<br> - It can't be done.<br> - Yes, yes. I believe that...<br> ...but there is something<br> that can be done.<br> You can get me an interview<br> with the prisoner.<br> One interview is all I want.<br> And what good will that do you?<br> You leave that to me.<br> I'll tell you that presently.<br> Well, Mr. Carton, you know<br> I don't like getting mixed up in things.<br> You can't trust these foreigners.<br> They'll cut your head off quicker<br> than you can say Jack Robinson.<br> How long do you think your head<br> would stay on your shoulders...<br> ...if I told the Committee<br> of Public Safety you were a spy...<br> ...of the Marquis St. Evremonde?<br> Don't say that.<br> I won't...<br> ...provided you do<br> what I tell you now.<br> I'll... I'll do as you say, Mr. Carton...<br> ...but remember now,<br> we can't trust nobody.<br> Very well. Now...<br> Oh, Citizen Barsad.<br> Citizen Victor.<br> The... The Evremonde cell,<br> which is it?<br> Third on the left.<br> - Ten minutes, no more.<br> - Right.<br> Wait.<br> Carton. Of all people on earth...<br> You least expected to see me.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I bring a request from Lucie.<br> She begs you to do exactly as I say.<br> Yes, but... Carton, I don't know<br> what you have in mind, but it's useless...<br> ...to attempt any form of escape.<br> It will involve all of you.<br> I have a plan that won't.<br> Now, write what I dictate. Hurry.<br> - What's the plan?<br> - No, no, write, quickly.<br> You will remember...<br> ...the words...<br> ...that passed between us...<br> ...on a certain occasion.<br> - What occasion?<br> - Never mind. Write.<br> I am grateful...<br> ...the time has come...<br> ...when I can prove them.<br> That I do so...<br> ...is no subject...<br> ...for regret or grief.<br> - What's that?<br> - Nothing.<br> Something queer, queer smelling.<br> - No, take the pen and finish. Hurry.<br> - L...<br> - I'm faint.<br> - No. Quick, write.<br> I said that if ever...<br> ...I could do anything...<br> ...for you...<br> ...or those dear to you...<br> Carton...<br> Citizen Victor. Twenty-one, eh?<br> Looks like that sharp female,<br> La Guillotine...<br> ...is going to have<br> a very busy day tomorrow.<br> - Tell me, what's Evremonde's number?<br> - Evremonde is 23.<br> Twenty-three.<br> Tell me, Citizen Victor...<br> ...what time do you take them<br> to the room for the last call?<br> Early in the morning.<br> Aristos have a good time in there.<br> They play cards, have mock trials.<br> - It's just like a club.<br> - Club?<br> That's a club that I don't wanna join.<br> Barsad.<br> It looks like my friend is ready.<br> Here, Citizen Victor, hop it<br> and buy yourself a bottle of cognac.<br> I'm afraid we're not going to<br> pull this through, Mr. Carton.<br> Do as you're told, and we will.<br> There's got to be a number 23 here<br> in the morning.<br> There will be. Now help me.<br> Mr. Carton, you couldn't pay me<br> to do what you're doing, sir.<br> I dare say you've got your price<br> for even this.<br> Oh, no, not me, Mr. Carton.<br> Now remember, you must get him<br> to Mr. Lorry's by 8:00.<br> Very good, I will.<br> Wait.<br> Now help me to get him to his feet.<br> All right, call your friend.<br> Victor. Victor, come on.<br> Give us a hand here.<br> - What's this?<br> - He's fainted.<br> - Take hold of his shoulders.<br> - I noticed he staggered<br> a bit as he came in.<br> Yes. When he saw Evremonde<br> had drawn a prize...<br> ...in the lottery of St. Guillotine,<br> it bowled him over.<br> Well, let's get him out.<br> - Mr. Cruncher. Mr. Cruncher.<br> - Aye.<br> Come up and help carry<br> Mr. Darnay down. Hurry.<br> Hurrying, Miss Pross. Hurrying.<br> Today, citizeness,<br> your years of waiting end...<br> ...when Master Evremonde<br> spits in the sack, eh?<br> It is not the end.<br> He is not the last of the Evremondes.<br> The wife must follow the husband.<br> The child must follow the father.<br> I'll go to them now. They'll be frantic.<br> They'll denounce the justice<br> of the republic and then...<br> And then:<br> Take this.<br> Have it ready for me at my usual seat<br> by the guillotine this afternoon.<br> You can stop wind and fire, but not her.<br> And don't let anything delay you,<br> Miss Pross.<br> I pray he gets my Ladybird<br> and her family out of France.<br> - Mr. Cruncher, don't dally.<br> - Don't beat the willing horse, Miss Pross.<br> If I ever get out of this<br> here crisis alive...<br> ...I'll make a vow I'll never stop<br> me old woman from flopping.<br> - She can even meditate when convenient.<br> - I am not interested in<br> your family situation.<br> I must go fetch<br> the other two small bags from the house.<br> Citizen doctor.<br> - Oh, no, you don't.<br> - Let me pass.<br> Never. I know what you want.<br> I know what you're after.<br> I thank heaven I'm put here to stop you,<br> for stop you I will.<br> - In the name of the republic, I...<br> - In the name of no one, you evil woman.<br> You've killed many innocent people.<br> No doubt you'll kill many more.<br> But my Ladybird<br> you shall never touch again.<br> No? Do you know who I am?<br> You might, from your appearance,<br> be the wife of Lucifer...<br> ...yet you shall not get the better of me.<br> I'm an Englishwoman. I'm your match.<br> Pig, get out of my way<br> or I'll break you in pieces.<br> Break away then. I don't care<br> an English tuppence for myself...<br> ...and I know that<br> the longer I keep you here...<br> ...the greater hope there is<br> for my Ladybird.<br> You're sick.
