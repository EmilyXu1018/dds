Yes.<br> I'll be honest with you.<br> I'm a divorced woman.<br> I'm under a lot of strain and tension.<br> I'm not sleeping too well.<br> I can do with some good,<br> healthy, uninvolved sex...<br> ...with someone who loves his wife and<br> won't be a pain in the ass when it's over.<br> This must be your lucky day.<br> I thought it was, but not in this<br> overworked little joy station...<br> ...where the sheets haven't been changed<br> and I've to be in the office in half an hour.<br> If you would like to arrange<br> a nice weekend somewhere...<br> ...away from London, in the sun,<br> where the sheets are changed every day...<br> ...please do.

I have another one.<br> Anything special, Derek?<br> No, not really.<br> Just the weekly sarcastic note<br> from New York.<br> Donnelly still wonders why Paris<br> runs ahead of us on sales and adjustments.<br> Also, Braithwaite took his usual<br> upside-down look at this lot...<br> ...and started measuring your chair size.<br> Anything else?<br> Isn't that enough?<br> Could you get me one<br> of those continental weather reports?<br> Continental weather report.<br> Excuse me.<br> What?<br> Come in.<br> Good afternoon.<br> - I have a surprise.<br> - What?<br> I've arranged us a week in Spain.<br> Could you just move,<br> because I'm trying to sketch.<br> - Pretty as you are, I can't see through you.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - A week?<br> - A week.<br> - I said a weekend.<br> - You can't just spend a weekend in Spain.<br> - It takes that long for room service.<br> - What about my children?<br> Who will run this place?<br> Maggie, the shoulder.<br> You'll love it. Warm winds, great food,<br> buffet right by the swimming pool.<br> Big soft towels.<br> - You can see Gibraltar.<br> - I would adore to see Gibraltar.<br> But I have a dog that needs exercise,<br> a cat that's losing its hair...<br> ...a model who can't stand straight.<br> Maggie, please.<br> - There are no problems we can't overcome.<br> - I wish I could...<br> Why aren't you at the airport?<br> Because, Mrs. Allessio, I'm only mortal.<br> I'm not Apollo.<br> When God made me,<br> he gave me hands, not wings.<br> - What an oversight.<br> - Just sign it. I've got a car waiting.<br> - Hello, I'm Cecil.<br> - Steven Blackburn.<br> - Buying or selling?<br> - Begging.<br> How many times have I told you?<br> A customs declaration should be typed.<br> That would take forever, sweetie pie.<br> I only type with one finger...<br> ...and I've hurt it.<br> Please don't tell me how.<br> Vickie, you have a long distance call.<br> It's New York.<br> Get that to the airport.

Goodbye.<br> I told him you're a classy fella. Are you?<br> I've got to be.<br> I live around the corner from Disraeli.<br> There we are.<br> Thank you.<br> Come on, Josie.<br> Here we are at last. Thank you, dear.<br> - Gently does it, Gloria.<br> - Thanks, Daddy.<br> Don't you think we should have wired<br> Steve we were coming?<br> Why spoil his fun?<br> This way he'll have a lovely surprise.<br> Good afternoon, I'm Miss Ramos.<br> Can I help you?<br> Good afternoon, Miss Ramos,<br> my name is Blackburn.<br> Reservations for two round-trip tickets<br> to Mlaga, night flight tonight.<br> Thank you, Mr. Blackburn, I'll just check.<br> The seats are available, sir.<br> Charge mine to my travel card,<br> I'll pay cash for the other one.<br> Why not charge both tickets,<br> Mr. Blackburn?<br> This is a business card.<br> I charge my ticket to the business.<br> They pay for it and the other is<br> a surprise vacation trip for my mother.<br> - How nice. What's your mother's name?<br> - Vickie.<br> Vickie Allessio.<br> - Allessio?<br> - She remarried.<br> I'll get the tickets.<br> Here, one for Mr. Blackburn<br> and one for Mrs. Allessio.<br> I'll take that. I'm Mrs. Allessio.<br> Happy Mother's Day.<br> Just tell me one thing:<br> Why must you leave tonight...<br> ...on the very day<br> my parents arrive for a visit?<br> Because when the S.S. Sera Magoso<br> rammed into the S.S. Antonio...<br> ...ripping out its corkscrew<br> turbine rotor shaft...<br> ...they didn't know about your parents,<br> or they would've avoided each another.<br> - You could send Braithwaite there.<br> - That's all I need now.<br> Why don't you both go down?<br> We didn't come to see you.<br> We came to be with our babies.<br> I'd love that, Grace,<br> but Gloria hates the place.<br> She can't stand the wind, the food.<br> Isn't that right, dear?<br> We were there last September.<br> - It was miserable.<br> - But in July, it's gorgeous.<br> Really. You'll enjoy it.<br> Ask her nice, Steve.<br> You might have a pretty roommate.<br> Why not try it, dear?<br> Maybe in July, it won't have the wind<br> and the lousy food and the heat.<br> - The flies.<br> - You think I can still get a ticket?<br> - That's another thing.<br> - That's easy.<br> - What are you flying?<br> - Iberian.<br> - You want me to call?<br> - No, I'll get it.<br> - Do you know the number?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> If you have any problems,<br> I know Valdez very well.<br> He runs the outfit.<br> He'd be glad to help you.<br> Valdez. If I need him, I'll call him.<br> Hello, lberia, this is Mr. Blackburn.<br> I made a reservation.<br> Hello, Mr. Blackburn. This is Miss Ramos.<br> You're still on.<br> Yes, I'm still on. Our night girl got sick.<br> I need one more ticket<br> on the Mlaga flight for Mrs. Blackburn.<br> Your grandmother?<br> My wife.<br> We can confirm that reservation.<br> The party will be you, your wife,<br> and your mother.<br> Thank you, Miss Ramos.<br> That's that.<br> Come on, dear. We'd better pack.<br> Just close the door, please. Come on, dog.<br> Quick, lovely ride in the car.<br> In you get. All right.<br> Good.<br> Oh, dog.<br> When are you gonna learn to walk?<br> God, you're heavy.<br> Are you mad? What are you doing?<br> My mother is allergic to cats,<br> dogs and birds.<br> - See you next week.<br> - But I've got a dog, a cat and a bird.<br> Then you'll have two dogs, two cats<br> and two birds. Two of everything, Cecil.<br> Are they housebroken?<br> I can only vouch for the bird.<br> My God.<br> Come along.<br> Gloria, have I ever criticized you<br> about the way you raise the children?<br> - No.<br> - Never?<br> But this time you're blowing it.<br> We'll return to two really screwed-up kids.<br> You know how your folks treat them.<br> Bicycles for this. Roller skates for that.<br> They bribe them for affection.<br> Remember when Billy came back<br> from a month with them?<br> He wouldn't smile until I gave him $3.<br> I'm telling you.<br> There's a time to think of yourself<br> and a time to think of the children.<br> - What's lberia's number?<br> - I'll do it.<br> I suppose there is<br> only one practical solution.<br> That's right.<br> - Hello, lberia, Miss Ramos?<br> - We'll take the kids with us.<br> This is Mr. Blackburn,<br> and we'll take the kids with us.<br> Take the kids with us?<br> You're right, darling.<br> They'll be better off with us.<br> - Are you serious?<br> - I'll make some excuse to my parents.<br> Make the reservation, darling.<br> Miss Ramos, I'd like to add my son<br> and daughter to that party.<br> They're just little children.<br> Do you take them that late at night?<br> Yes, and I can confirm that for you now.<br> Thank you.<br> We've just been confirmed.<br> Good.<br> And please make sure<br> they clean their teeth. 'Bye.<br> The airport, please.<br> Maria, get the children up and packed.<br> We're taking them to Marbella.<br> Maria, lay out their beach things.<br> I'll come and check it all, okay?<br> - I'll go help Maria.<br> - Just a second.<br> Hi, Miss Ramos, this is Mr. Blackburn.<br> I want two more seats.<br> Mr. And Mrs. Wendell Thompson.<br> Yes, Miss Ramos, my in-laws.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Just a minute, Miss Ramos.<br> You don't think they would miss a chance<br> to spoil their grandchildren, do you?<br> They'll be down on the next plane,<br> if they have to buy the airline.<br> God, it's turning into a pilgrimage.<br> You'd better go down alone.<br> I think that makes sense, too.<br> Miss Ramos, cancel my in-laws,<br> my wife and my children.<br> Just you and Mother.<br> Roger.<br> Are you free?<br> It's lberia. There's rather a lot. I think<br> if you went round it might be easier.<br> - Thanks. How much?<br> - &2, madam.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - 'Bye.<br> - Thanks very much.<br> - Cheers.<br> Hey, Steve. Steve.<br> - Over here, it's Walter.<br> - Hello, Walter.<br> How are you doing?<br> - Where are you headed? Mlaga?<br> - Yeah.<br> So am I. Who are you with?<br> Nobody.<br> - Good. We'll sit together on the plane.<br> - Swell.<br> That's terrific.<br> I hate to sit with strangers on a plane.<br> They try to tell you their life story.<br> They really annoy you.<br> You know what I mean?<br> - Gloria all right?<br> - Fine. Great.<br> - And the children?<br> - The children are great.<br> Steve, there is something<br> I wanted to talk to you about.<br> I got this screenplay ready to shoot.<br> It's a Western with weirdoes.<br> I got these Apaches...<br> ...and they start sucking this peyote root.<br> It drives them crazy.<br> Everyone starts banging everyone else.<br> It's got everything: Pot, sex, massacres,<br> orgies. Take the whole family.<br> It's gonna cost about $600,000.<br> Do you think Gloria's old man<br> would like to go in for about $200,000?<br> - What?<br> - The picture I just told you about.<br> Sorry, Walt. That's my deaf side.<br> Do you think Gloria's father<br> would invest $250,000 in my new picture?<br> - No.<br> - Are you sure?<br> Positive. He's been approached before.<br> You know something?<br> I liked you better when you couldn't hear.<br> I ordered a car, a Seat 124.<br> Seor Blackburn, if you complete<br> the papers, I'll get the keys.<br> - A Seat 124 is really a Fiat.<br> - Yes.<br> It's not a bad little car.<br> It'll hold all the luggage you have.<br> - Don't talk to me. Don't look at me.<br> - What?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Steve, boy.<br> - That's what's the matter.<br> - Hi, Walter. Son of a bitch.<br> You'd think those customs guys<br> would know me by now.<br> What a mess. Excuse me, Miss.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> - Stand by, pal. I may need you.<br> I'm Walter Menkes of Menkes Films.<br> I'd like a Seat 124.<br> I'm sorry. We don't have one car left.<br> You've got a car. A car.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Good, you can give me a lift.<br> You can find him a car.<br> He's a friend of mine.<br> What's the sweat?<br> You drop me off at Los Monteros.<br> - They got cars.<br> - It's on your way.<br> - Patty and the kids are waiting.<br> - What about those cars?<br> - They're reserved.<br> - You must have something.<br> We do have a Seat 600<br> that's just been returned.<br> But I'm a little nervous about the clutch.<br> - He'll take it.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You know what a 600 is?<br> It's a kiddie car. It's this big.<br> - Oh, boy.<br> - You've got to step outside to shift gears.<br> You don't drive it. You mail it.<br> In the water,<br> it becomes an outboard motor.<br> All right, Walter.<br> You take my car. I'll take the 600.<br> - This is stupid.<br> - It's not stupid.<br> I'll drop you off.<br> - We'll have a nice ride, pleasant talk.<br> - It's no good.<br> Why not?<br> I've got this...<br> I've got a trick back.<br> If someone else drives...<br> ...it could easily go right into spasm.<br> - Spasm?<br> You know, you're a sick fellow<br> with the ear and the spasms.<br> It's 2:00 a.m. I have to drive two hours.<br> Please take the car.<br> - Can I at least buy you a meal?<br> - Sure.<br> Tonight?<br> - Great.<br> - Dinner?<br> - Fine.<br> - Why should you be alone?<br> We'll have a nice quiet evening.<br> Just you, me, Patty and the boys.<br> We'll have a fun evening.<br> - After dinner, I'll read you the screenplay.<br> - I look forward to it.<br> Miss?<br> - Can I give you a lift?<br> - Thank you. I'm being met.<br> You should go. It sounds like fun.<br> What is this?<br> - Where do I sign?<br> - Here.<br> - Ever been in one of these?<br> - In Italy, when I was younger and shorter.<br> - Can you manage this?<br> - On my knee. Anything else?<br> Well, there's this.<br> - Gracias.<br> - Gracias.<br> If the clutch gives you any trouble,<br> change the car in Marbella.<br> I'll keep it in mind.<br> - Have a pleasant trip.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Adis.<br> That's second, it's an Italian gearbox.<br> - Thanks.<br> - No, that's third. First is up here.<br> - See?<br> - I see.<br> Good thing you're here.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yes.<br> - Nervous?<br> - No.<br> That's my girl.<br> It's a nice little car. It spins right along.<br> - You're still in first.<br> - Of course.<br> - Use the clutch.<br> - Right.<br> Sorry. I'm sorry.<br> There's a car coming.<br> There's a truck, it's trying to pass you.<br> Come on.<br> You're still in third.<br> - Would you like to drive?<br> - No.<br> - You sure?<br> - Positive.<br> Besides, I didn't bring my license.<br> For God's sake.<br> You'd think there'd be a porter<br> or something.<br> Leave the stuff here<br> and I'll come back for it.<br> It's all right.<br> I've always wanted long arms.<br> - You all right?<br> - I'm all right.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> My name is Blackburn.<br> This is Mrs. Allessio.<br> - We ordered a suite.<br> - Un momento, seor.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Blackburn...<br> ...but there's no reservation for a suite.<br> It's a room. A double room.<br> - Any objections?<br> - Anything, as long as I can see Gibraltar.<br> - Will we see Gibraltar?<br> - S, seor.<br> This way, please.<br> Just one moment, please. What is that?<br> What is what?<br> Does Gibraltar<br> have washing hanging all over it?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Because if it doesn't,<br> we don't have a view of Gibraltar.<br> What do we have a view of?<br> Roughly, I'd say the laundry.<br> Don't be ridiculous. They don't even have<br> big laundries down here.<br> - What is that out there?<br> - It's the laundry.<br> It's the laundry.<br> I told you we want to see Gibraltar.<br> We want a room with a view of Gibraltar,<br> comprende?<br> S, seor.<br> What we'd like, seor,<br> is a room with a view...<br> ...and a toilet with a seat.<br> That's not asking too much, is it?<br> Vickie?<br> Why don't we unpack in the morning?<br> - Aren't you tired?<br> - Only of unpacking.<br> I see.<br> Very well.<br> - Would you like that light on or off?<br> - Whichever you prefer.<br> - How about on?<br> - Certainly.<br> Would you do me a very big favor?<br> I thought that's what I was doing.<br> Would you mind getting on the other side?<br> What's wrong with this side?<br> Nothing, it's just more natural for me<br> being on that side.<br> I don't want to cause<br> an international incident...<br> ...but it's more natural for me this side.<br> We always started this way.<br> - We?<br> - Me and my Italian.<br> He had this tennis elbow<br> and a bad shoulder and...<br> Anyway, I just got used to this side.<br> It doesn't work for me.<br> - Why not?<br> - I'm deaf in my left ear.<br> What's that got to do with it?<br> - I won't be able to hear you.<br> - I'm not going to say very much.<br> You're going to breathe.<br> Sometimes that sounds pretty good.<br> Who knows? A word of encouragement<br> may slip out, it could do wonders.<br> - Shall I walk around?<br> - What?<br> Shall I walk around?<br> Why don't you slip over<br> and I'll slide under?<br> No, I think it's better if I slip under<br> and you slide over.<br> Why don't we just kind of roll towards...<br> It's getting awfully late. Why don't you<br> just get on top and hope for the best?<br> - I've heard it put more romantically.<br> - Indeed.<br> Christ, you're beautiful.<br> - My God, you can see Gibraltar.<br> - Where?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Spasm.<br> - I'm in spasm.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You think you're in spasm<br> and you're not in spasm, and I'm in spasm.<br> - Oh, boy.<br> - What do I do?<br> I think you better call the doctor.<br> Get the doctor.<br> Don't move. Please, don't move.<br> - How do I get the doctor if I don't move?<br> - Very slowly, that's all. Very slowly.<br> Oh, God!<br> Buenos das, seoras, seores.<br> Another beautiful day on the Costa del Sol.<br> I can't reach the phone. If you can just...<br> I've got the phone.<br> Help! What's doctor in Spanish?<br> - What is Spanish for doctor?<br> - II dottore.<br> - You sure?<br> - I think so.<br> - It sounds Italian.<br> - Well, maybe it's Italian. It's foreign.<br> - You tell them.<br> - Please, I'm in spasm.<br> - He's in spasm.<br> - Could you send a doctor?<br> Easy.<br> Gently.<br> Now, what precisely were you doing<br> when this thing happened?<br> I was sort of...<br> We were making love.<br> We were making love.<br> So, in the middle of making love<br> with this woman...<br> ...you turned to see Gibraltar.<br> - S?<br> - S.<br> I see.<br> Now, I'm going to turn you over, so relax.<br> Very gently. Gently.<br> Okay, it's coming.<br> Relax. That's it.<br> - Would you give me a hand with the foot?<br> - Hand with the foot?<br> Yes, give him a hand with the foot.<br> Very gently. Relax.<br> How do you feel?<br> Better. Better.<br> Good. Now you can put him<br> back in the bed.<br> Thank you.<br> Easy. Gently.<br> Give him this.<br> - This?<br> - To sleep.<br> - To sleep.<br> - Rest good.<br> And do not try to make love again<br> until you can touch your toes.<br> - Touch my toes?<br> - Like this.<br> Then everything will be all right. Adis.<br> - Adis.<br> - Adis.<br> Gracias.<br> Muchas gracias.<br> Can I have the pills, please?<br> How are you enjoying the trip so far?<br> Nice.<br> That's what I thought.<br> Aren't you going to get under the covers?<br> No.<br> I see. Nice.<br> Mom, can I have one of these?<br> All the guys have them.<br> No, no, no.<br> Why not, Mom?<br> Excuse me, do you speak English?<br> I try, but I'm an American.<br> I have a son about the same size as yours.<br> Could I borrow him?<br> - You can have him all day if you want to.<br> - Thanks. Do you mind?<br> - Are you British?<br> - Yes.<br> - From London? Me, too.<br> - Yes.<br> We've been living there for years.<br> What did you say your name was?<br> Well, I didn't.<br> But it's Allessio, Vickie Allessio.<br> Thanks very much.<br> - Where are you staying?<br> - Guadalmina.<br> Maybe you and Mr. Allessio would have<br> dinner with my husband and me.<br> Well, that's very kind of you,<br> but I'm afraid I'm right out of Mr. Allessios.<br> - Are you here alone?<br> - Yes.<br> - That makes it easier.<br> - It doesn't actually.<br> Because I'm here for a sort of a rest.<br> And I'm on a diet. And you know how it is.<br> Thanks for the use of the chest.<br> Mrs. Allessio, how do you spell that?<br> Two L's, two S's and I'm out a lot.<br> No.<br> Hello.<br> How are you feeling?<br> - I can touch my toes.<br> - Can you?<br> You do realize<br> that I've just greased myself...<br> ...with two tubes of very expensive<br> suntan oil?<br> I couldn't help noticing.<br> Pardon me for asking, but did you always<br> get what you want when you wanted it?<br> Even before I knew what to do with it.<br> If we are going to eat,<br> and I really think we...<br> Are you still asleep?<br> I feel marvelous.<br> I fell asleep before I could say thanks.<br> How do you feel?<br> Fine. But they do stop serving lunch<br> in 10 minutes.<br> Everything okay?<br> I booked a table,<br> but you know what they're like.<br> You know what I mean.<br> How was it for you?<br> Very nice.<br> - "Very nice"?<br> - Yes.<br> - Just "very nice"?<br> - What's wrong with "very nice"?<br> "Very nice" is hardly the phrase to describe<br> two bodies locked in heavenly transport.<br> You wouldn't chisel "very nice" in granite<br> under Rodin's The Kiss.<br> "Very nice" is when you get a get well card<br> from the butcher or TV repairman.<br> That's "very nice."<br> But for what we just did, the comments<br> range from lousy to sensational.<br> The rockets went off or the earth moved.<br> For God's sake.<br> These things take time.<br> This is a body not a machine.<br> You don't just press a button<br> and "Pow! " the earth moves.<br> - It moved pretty good for me.<br> - Well, lucky you.<br> God, you are all the same.<br> This obsession with male sexual prowess.<br> It is so typically American.<br> - Is it?<br> - It is, if you don't mind me telling you.<br> I don't mind you telling me. Not a bit.<br> It's that phrase I can't stand,<br> "Typically American."<br> Why not?<br> Because there's no such thing<br> as "typically American."<br> It's a big place. Which "typically<br> American" Americans do you mean?<br> The cab drivers in New York?<br> The coalminers in Pennsylvania?<br> The students at Berkeley? The Mormons<br> in Utah? The Harlem Globetrotters?<br> The daughters of the American Revolution,<br> you mean those?<br> I'll tell you,<br> they're all throwing rocks at each other.<br> The only thing "typically American"<br> about 200 million Americans...<br> ...is that they never do anything "typically"<br> alike and that goes for humping, too.<br> Well, of course. I've had it off<br> with all 200 million of them.<br> Don't be an idiot.<br> Why are you so angry?<br> The earth moved for you.<br> I've never seen anyone<br> change so fast in my life.<br> I haven't changed a bit.<br> I'm the same sweet, sex-crazed<br> "typical American" I was 20 minutes ago!<br> And just remember this:<br> There is no better way for a man<br> to start the day...<br> ...than with that bracing, glowing,<br> ego-building feeling...<br> ...of knowing that he has struck out<br> in the sack.<br> "Struck out in the sack" is, I assume...<br> ...a mixed metaphor,<br> undoubtedly American, and probably nasty.<br> - It'll do.<br> - And may I point out...<br> ...as you have never noticed,<br> women are a little different from men.<br> - They require time. A little sensitivity.<br> - English women.<br> All women!<br> Anybody but a superannuated Boy Scout<br> would know that.<br> End of conversation. Oh, boy!<br> - "Oh, boy" what?<br> - Nothing.<br> It just takes time to know a person.<br> - It certainly does.<br> - Time and trouble.<br> Lots of time and lots of trouble.<br> - Right.<br> - Do you want lunch?<br> - Just a sandwich. I'm playing golf.<br> - Good. I'll trail along.<br> - You don't have to.<br> - No, but I could use the exercise.<br> I'll say. God knows,<br> you didn't get any this morning.<br> Enrique, 100 for the first nine,<br> - Comprende?<br> - S, seor.<br> - Mucho bene.<br> - I shall win though.<br> Are you gambling with this child?<br> It's not gambling.<br> These kids have Spanish pride.<br> So instead of tipping him, I let him win.<br> - So he wins, does he?<br> - Yeah, if he can.<br> I see.<br> - What is that supposed to mean?<br> - What is what supposed to mean?<br> "I see." That supercilious, cold-assed,<br> English way of saying "I see."<br> It means I'm delighted<br> the boy has a chance to win.<br> I'd hate to witness a grown man<br> who has to beat an 8-year-old child.<br> He's 13, smokes cigarettes,<br> goes to the flamenco dancer...<br> ...and he gives me two shots aside.<br> - Ol!<br> - You gonna count that?<br> - You play four.<br> - She was talking to me.<br> - You lie three, you play four.<br> You know, winning is not that important.<br> You learn that as you go through life.<br> That's right. It's how you play the game.<br> Nice shot.<br> Nice shot.<br> - Muy bien.<br> - Try and stay off the green, will you?<br> What is it?<br> My cousins want to bet on me.<br> - Your cousins want to bet on you?<br> - S.<br> - Starting from here?<br> - S.<br> - Hundred, hundred, hundred?<br> - S.<br> - They're gonna give me two shots aside?<br> - S.<br> It's their money.<br> Seor, my cousins' friends<br> would like to bet on me.<br> - Your cousins' friends want to bet on you?<br> - S.<br> - Same action as before?<br> - S.<br> Okay, kid.<br> - Hey, seor.<br> - What is it?<br> My cousins' friends' cousins<br> would like to bet on me.<br> - Your cousins' friends' cousins?<br> - S.<br> - Same action as before?<br> - S.<br> Okay, kid. Get out the way you got in.<br> Vale.<br> Perdname.<br> What are you doing? What's all this?<br> Here is your money.<br> Forget it. I just got lucky.<br> You win a few, you lose a few. Here.<br> Buy the boys a drink. See you later.<br> What's bugging you now?<br> - Apart from the fact you're still in second?<br> - Yes.<br> All right. This isn't a romantic holiday,<br> it's a proving ground.<br> I think you brought me here for<br> the same reason you had to beat that kid.<br> - You do, huh?<br> - I do, "huh."<br> And I think your wife<br> gives you two shots aside...<br> ...and she's not happy in the end, either.<br> Let's get one thing straight,<br> since I came with you, not Freud...<br> ...which was my first mistake,<br> I've had all the amateur analysis I can take.<br> - Is that clear?<br> - Perfectly, and you're still in second.<br> I'm going to Mlaga<br> to take care of my business.<br> I figure I'll eat out. Alone.<br> You'll enjoy the company.<br> Hey, Steve!<br> I just called your room.<br> I wanted to see if you're still free tonight.<br> - I sure am, Walter.<br> - Good.<br> Antonio's at the port at 8:30.<br> - Good. See you then.<br> - Okay.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Business.<br> How's the clutch?<br> - What?<br> - The clutch!<br> - Fine!<br> - Okay.<br> Hello.<br> - Miss Allessio?<br> - Yes.<br> This is the lady you met this morning.<br> The one with the little boy.<br> - You borrowed his chest.<br> - How are you?<br> Would you like to go to dinner<br> with my husband and me tonight?<br> That would be very nice.<br> Great. We'll pick you up at about 8:15.<br> I'll look forward to it.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Mr. Menkes' table.<br> Hey, Steve, over here!<br> Hello, Walter.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Hello, Patty.<br> - Hi, Steve. How are you?<br> Steve, this is Vickie Allessio.<br> You two are in the same hotel.<br> This is Steve Blackburn.<br> Mr. Blackburn.<br> Mrs. Allessio.<br> We're off and running.<br> But you've got to be careful.<br> He's a slow starter, but he finishes fast.<br> So watch out.<br> - Wally.<br> - What's wrong?<br> They're two healthy people,<br> down here on their own.<br> No ties. No responsibilities.<br> It makes your mouth water.<br> Wally.<br> What do you want to drink?<br> - Whatever Mrs. Allessio wants.<br> - Whatever Mr. Blackburn wants.<br> - What about sangria?<br> - Yes. They say sangria's great.<br> - Lovely.<br> - Fine.<br> Camarero!<br> It's very Spanish. We're here.<br> Could I have some water?<br> Camarero!<br> I was just telling Wally this afternoon,<br> it's a shame Steve's wife couldn't come.<br> You'd just love her. Wouldn't she?<br> - They'd love each other.<br> - Really?<br> She's such an amazing girl.<br> She's had every advantage,<br> and you'd never know.<br> No pretenses, no airs.<br> She sounds wonderful.<br> - Why didn't you bring her?<br> - I wish I had.<br> You'd never get Gloria to leave those kids.<br> She devotes herself to them,<br> night and day. Especially the little one.<br> - How old is Josie now?<br> - Seven.<br> Cute as a button, but she's got a bit of a...<br> - What is it, a metabolism problem?<br> - Metabolism.<br> Oh, dear.<br> - So she's a little on the heavy side.<br> - Of course.<br> Could I have some more wine?<br> Camarero!<br> But Josie's really a lovely girl,<br> and once she finishes at the orthodontist...<br> ...she's gonna be gorgeous.<br> She has crooked teeth?<br> I think there's something more interesting<br> to talk about...<br> ...than my daughter's metabolism rate<br> or fixing her teeth.<br> We could talk about my kids' teeth,<br> but they don't stop eating long enough...<br> ...to get them fixed.<br> Did I say something wrong?<br> Oh, boy.<br> There you go "oh, boying" again.<br> What's bothering Mr. Sensitive now?<br> What do you know about sensitivity,<br> picking on a child?<br> I did not. I'm sure she's a lovely girl.<br> A lovely fat girl with crooked teeth.<br> - They're not crooked. Just overlapping.<br> - That's crooked.<br> - This is ridiculous. Let's call a truce.<br> - Fine by me.<br> You are extraordinary. I've never known<br> an adult who could be hurt so easily.<br> - Do you come from a large family?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Lots of brothers and sisters?<br> There you are, then.<br> Your mother spent too much time<br> with the others.<br> Is this a seminar on family relations?<br> You finish chopping up my daughter,<br> you start on my mother.<br> It's a strange time<br> to start attacking someone's mother.<br> - I wasn't attacking. I was talking.<br> - I don't call that talking.<br> - Tearing up a lady who never did you harm.<br> - I don't believe this!<br> She was a marvelous woman.<br> And I'll tell you this:<br> We weren't the richest kids,<br> but I never went to school in a dirty shirt.<br> Dear God!<br> Polio shots.<br> First electric blanket on the block.<br> Great food in the winter.<br> You lie there and hack away<br> at a woman like that.<br> Suddenly, I'm in bed with your mother.<br> In bed with my mother?<br> That's the most disgusting thing<br> I've ever heard in my life.<br> - What are you doing now?<br> - I'm leaving the sanatorium.<br> I've had enough therapy.<br> - I'm going back to London, tonight.<br> - It'll do us both the world of good.<br> You bet your ass.<br> What a washout this has been.<br> I'm gonna press it in my book of memories.<br> You should have been a worm.<br> A cestode worm. You know why?<br> Because it has a complete set<br> of male and female sexual organs...<br> ...in each of its 100 sections,<br> and spends its life copulating with itself.<br> Wouldn't that be lovely? You could've<br> taken you away for a weekend.<br> You'd have had you all to yourself.<br> And all those questions.<br> "Was I good? You were wonderful.<br> Did the earth move? The house collapsed.<br> "Am I manly?<br> No, but you're a great worm."<br> You missed your profession: A worm.<br> Crawling and humping its way through life,<br> and badly.<br> Thank you.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - London. It's where I live.<br> You can leave tomorrow.<br> I've had this place with or without you,<br> and even if we must go together...<br> ...I am going home to my thin children,<br> with their straight teeth.<br> You can go tomorrow.<br> - I am going now!<br> - All right. Okay.<br> But I don't want to hear one more word<br> out of you ever. Is that understood?<br> Perfectly. So listen very clearly,<br> because this is the last thing I will say:<br> Make a reservation.<br> Not necessary.<br> And if you're not downstairs in 10 minutes,<br> I'm leaving without you.<br> You can stay here and find another worm,<br> and hold another seminar.<br> - Can I help you, sir?<br> - Flight 826 to London.<br> - Two tickets, please.<br> - Flight 826 to London is full.<br> - Flight 826 to London is never full.<br> - It is tonight, sir.<br> - When did the last two tickets go?<br> - Just a few moments ago.<br> Press that in your book of memories.<br> - When is the next plane to London?<br> - 11:30, tomorrow morning.<br> - Can I help you, miss?<br> - Thank you, I'm getting very good at this.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Welcome to the house of mirth.<br> One phone call. One stupid phone call.<br> It would've cost seven pesetas.<br> You could've won that from your caddie.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> I've had a bellyful<br> of your chicken-shit innuendos...<br> ...your snotty insults,<br> and your smart-assed needling.<br> Get stuffed, you big schmuck.<br> Listen to Princess Grace, here.<br> Bertha Ball-Buster.<br> You're as tender,<br> sweet and feminine as Attila the Hun.<br> - Well, you should know.<br> - You should have a uniform and a whistle.<br> You direct traffic in bed, out of bed,<br> on the phone, in the car.<br> Talk about penis envy. You invented it.<br> - Now!<br> - Now.<br> Don't break the lamp!<br> You typical American!<br> Is this a way to treat a hotel?<br> Don't do it!<br> Thank you very much. Good night.<br> - Now, Mr. Know-All!<br> - Okay.<br> For God's sake. My chance to be raped,<br> you can't get your trousers off.<br> Isn't that Vickie and Steve?<br> - I guess they're getting together.<br> - I hope we haven't started something.<br> With Steve? Not a chance.<br> He's probably selling her a policy.<br> She just grabbed his arm.<br> What should she grab? She just met him.<br> Watch the bull.<br> Ol!<br> - Don't tell me they weren't holding hands.<br> - You're fantastic.<br> Two people reach for a peanut<br> at the same time, they're holding hands.<br> - You got a mind like a house detective.<br> - You should know.<br> Just pass me the potato chips.<br> After you've checked them for fingerprints.<br> Oh, boy.<br> "Got no pajamas with my monogram<br> "And just like Papa, I am what I am<br> "But she loves me<br> She told me she loved me last night<br> "Oh, last night, oh, yes<br> "She loves me<br> She told me so last night<br> "Oh, last night<br> "She loves me<br> She told me so last night"<br> - That's really awful.<br> - I thought it was beautiful.<br> - Were you in love when you wrote it?<br> - Yes. I was 18, in college.<br> - I was always in love. Weren't you?<br> - No.<br> - Even at 18?<br> - No.<br> When did you first fall in love?<br> - I didn't.<br> - What?<br> That blind, passionate, all-out<br> whatever-it-is you're supposed to feel...<br> ...is something I have never felt.<br> Maybe I'm incapable.<br> I don't believe that.<br> Why not? After all, I'm your everyday<br> cold-assed, supercilious English woman.<br> I'm terribly sorry I said that.<br> Don't be. It warmed things up quite a bit.<br> It did? Well, I'm very pleased to hear that.<br> Mr. Blackburn.<br> - What is it?<br> - Your tickets to London are confirmed.<br> No. We don't leave until the 26th.<br> This is the 26th, seor. You leave at 5:00.<br> Thank you.<br> - Shall we take a swim?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Hey!<br> Look alive.<br> Ready when you are. Lights and camera.<br> All right.<br> - Action.<br> - Steve! Hey, Steve!<br> What's so important,<br> you have to crash in without calling?<br> Are you a dentist? I need an appointment?<br> It's business.<br> - There's nothing about your business...<br> - It's not my business.<br> It's too intelligent,<br> keeping my nose in my own business.<br> This is none of my business.<br> You and the lady.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - The bullfight, the beach...<br> ...the restaurant.<br> You could've taken out an ad.<br> What are we doing? Where you going?<br> Steve, I'm gonna tell you something.<br> How do you want it?<br> In front of her, here?<br> Or up there, all by ourselves?<br> Listen carefully, Steve.<br> I know what I'm talking about.<br> I'm one of the walking wounded.<br> It's true.<br> Even a schlep like me<br> gets a little action once in a while.<br> Most of it is tired quail<br> that fly south the next day.<br> But once, and only once,<br> did I hook into the real thing.<br> Happened in Malibu.<br> Oh, boy, was she something.<br> We had a great setup.<br> A shack on the beach. She cooked, I ate.<br> - What the hell, we dug each other.<br> - Do you know what a thrill this is?<br> To waste my last hours here<br> listening to the plot of your next dirty film?<br> This was for real, Steve.<br> And it was fantastic.<br> But then the guilt started tearing me apart.<br> - La cuenta.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> I went to a shrink five times a week<br> to hear the same questions.<br> "Do you love the girl? Sure, I do.<br> "Do you love your wife and kids?<br> Of course I love them.<br> "Would you give them up for the girl?<br> Hell, no.<br> "Would you give the girl up for them?<br> I can't. I love her."<br> $18,000 later, he came to the key question.<br> "Do you love her enough to give her up?"<br> That's the one that pinned me to the rack.<br> One cockamamie question<br> cost me $18,000.<br> And that doesn't include the Kleenex<br> I used up crying.<br> I didn't go back to the coast for five years.<br> By that time, she'd had twin boys...<br> ...and a kidney-shaped pool, went<br> to Weight Watchers every Thursday night.<br> I've got to meet Patty and the boys.<br> We're going on some fakakta picnic.<br> That's all I need now, Spanish ants.<br> You two may be two ships that passed<br> in the night and scraped hulls for a week.<br> In which case, relax and enjoy.<br> I see.<br> Lots of luck, boy-chick.<br> He was right, your fat friend.<br> He was right.<br> He loved a girl enough to give her up.<br> But, my God, $18,000?<br> I could have told him for a lot less.<br> I'm not giving you up.<br> - What?<br> - I'm not giving you up. Look.<br> - I know I'm selfish and neurotic.<br> - And American.<br> American.<br> - Married.<br> - Married.<br> - Spoiled.<br> - Spoiled.<br> Which is precisely<br> why I'm not giving you up.<br> Why can't we get a little flat in Soho?<br> We'll see each other whenever we can.<br> And if you're worried<br> about breaking up a family, forget it.<br> There will be no families broken up.<br> You just have to take my word for it.<br> I think that Soho makes a lot of sense,<br> for both of us.<br> You can walk there.<br> I can take a taxi, the tube, or the 22 bus.<br> Vickie, what the hell have we got to lose?<br> And which part of Soho<br> did you have in mind?<br> - Do you like Chinese food?<br> - I love Chinese.<br> The reason I ask is,<br> there is a street called Macclesfield Street.<br> - Do you know it?<br> - To know it is to love it.<br> - You've had a flat there before.<br> - Many times.<br> - What's the flat number?<br> - 4D.<br> They're all named French.<br> - You think they're related?<br> - Only in price.<br> - Only in what?<br> - Price.<br> What do you think?<br> - It's not bad.<br> - No, it isn't, is it? Really.<br> - It's got distinct possibilities.<br> - Sure.<br> Oh, God.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - You moving into 4D?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - I'm Dora French. I'm in 5D, just above.<br> - Hello.<br> If you get a bit busy...<br> Anything you can't handle,<br> know what I mean?<br> - I'd be most obliged.<br> - It would be my pleasure, certainly.<br> Yes.<br> - Thanks very much.<br> - Not at all.<br> - 'Bye.<br> - 'Bye.<br> This is the second day she's forgotten<br> her lunch box.<br> - Would you like some coffee, dear?<br> - No, I ate too much.<br> - Coq au vin was perfect.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I think I'm going to walk it off.<br> - Take Dilly with you.<br> - Dilly?<br> - Yeah, take him with you.<br> You think he should go out in the rain?<br> It stopped an hour ago.<br> Yeah. Right.<br> Dilly, come on.<br> Taxi!<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi.<br> - Sorry about this.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Are we eating?<br> - That is what we arranged.<br> Oh, right.<br> - What are we having?<br> - Coq au vin. I hope you're hungry.<br> - I can always eat.<br> - Good.<br> - I'll just put Dilly down.<br> - Take your coat off.<br> - How did you manage to get away?<br> - Actually, I'm out walking the dog.<br> Goodbye, coq au vin.<br> Your sweater.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Okay?<br> Give me that. Come on.<br> Crikey, you got four arms.<br> - Thursday.<br> - Thursday. Go on.<br> - Is that you, dear?<br> - Yeah.<br> How did it go?<br> Was he a good boy or a bad boy?<br> You know, he didn't do a thing.<br> I'm gonna take him for another 20 minutes.<br> That's silly.<br> No, if you're gonna train a dog,<br> you got to train him right.<br> Here, Dilly! Come on, Dilly!<br> Come on, boy. Come on, Dilly.<br> Taxi!<br> I've had a job offered me.<br> I wasn't gonna tell you.<br> I wasn't going to take it.<br> But I know now, it's the only way out.<br> - Where?<br> - A long way away. Johannesburg.<br> Eric.<br> My brother's out there.<br> They're opening a new hospital...<br> It's a fine opportunity, really.<br> I'll take Madeleine and the boys.<br> It's been torturing me,<br> the necessity of making a decision.<br> I haven't told anybody, not even Madeleine.<br> Do you want me to stay?<br> - To turn down the offer?<br> - Don't be foolish, Eric.<br> Forgive me?<br> Forgive you for what?<br> For bringing you so much misery.<br> I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me.<br> How will it end with us?<br> Don't talk about it. I don't know.<br> It'll end. Everything ends.<br> All that was a week ago.<br> Socks, please.<br> Today was our last day together.<br> Our very last together in all our lives.<br> Dirty enough?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - At 12:30 this morning.<br> Those last few hours went by so quickly.<br> - Sunday.<br> - Yeah, Sunday.<br> Sunday.<br> ...I had no thoughts at all.<br> Only an overwhelming desire<br> not to feel anything ever again.<br> Safe. The game's over.<br> Excuse me.<br> Sorry.<br> Here you are.<br> You're not leaving?<br> We're taking the kids to lunch<br> at Kew Gardens.<br> - Didn't I tell you?<br> - No.<br> - Christ, I thought I mentioned it. Sorry.<br> - That's all right.<br> - You didn't go to any trouble?<br> - No.<br> - You sure?<br> - Truly. Do you have time for coffee?<br> - I don't even have time for a shower.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> You gonna take the kids to lunch?<br> Something like that, yes. Don't worry.<br> - Sure?<br> - Truly.<br> - Why do you look worried?<br> - I'm only worried you'll be late.<br> - Have a nice day.<br> - And you.<br> Cecil? It's me. Listen.<br> How'd you like to come for lunch,<br> stay for dinner, play chess...<br> ...watch TV, and kiss me good night?<br> - Sorry, I've already made arrangements.<br> - Yes, of course you have.<br> 'Bye.<br> 'Bye.<br> The picture is just about set.<br> I hired this hot, new director.<br> Sensational. $12,000.<br> He's 24 years old, hair down to here.<br> He has to use a shoehorn<br> to get into his pants.<br> The guy wears bracelets.<br> He has heels like that.<br> - Walter.<br> - The guy's last picture was a smash.<br> - Kind of a group grope in 3D.<br> - Walter...<br> When you see those big boobs coming<br> out of the screen at you, you better duck.<br> - Walter.<br> - What?<br> - You remember that talk we had in Spain?<br> - Don't tell me that's still going on.<br> You told me that you broke up<br> with the girl because you loved her.<br> But you didn't tell me how.<br> Only one way, pal:<br> According to the rules laid down<br> by the Geneva Convention.<br> Kick her right in the teeth.<br> Lay it on the line.<br> Sometimes you got to be cruel to be kind.<br> - I got it.<br> - Lunch is on me.<br> I hate to see a guy losing them all.<br> Listen, could you lend me<br> a couple of pounds?<br> Why don't you sign, Walter?<br> They won't let me do that in here anymore.<br> My treat.<br> And the solid color<br> should be out there, okay?<br> Hello?<br> Hi.

See you later.<br> 'Bye.<br> - I'm in a hurry.<br> - All right.<br> It's flattering that you'd give up Beethoven<br> for me, even if it is only for 30 bars.<br> - Drink?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Vickie.<br> - Yes.<br> - Why don't you sit down?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Vickie.<br> - Yes, again.<br> I think I'll have that drink.<br> - You said you had something to say to me.<br> - I do.<br> I do.

We can't. We can't do this.<br> - I've done it.<br> - I've got to be at the Albert Hall.<br> - You don't have to be at the Albert Hall.<br> - They're playing Beethoven.<br> - Beethoven won't mind.<br> You've been gone a long time.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Fine.<br> Did you leave the house that way?<br> - What way?<br> - With a golf sock.<br> - I must have.<br> - How could that happen?<br> How many times have I told you,<br> "Keep the kids out of my drawers."<br> Okay, Steve.<br> From now on,<br> don't rush me when I'm dressing.<br> All right.<br> The actuarial reports, their sales receipts.<br> That's it, Derek, I'm off to lunch.<br> It's been a long time between lunches.<br> Nice of you to keep score, Derek,<br> but not essential.<br> - What do I say if someone calls?<br> - I told you, I'm out to lunch.<br> One of the long ones,<br> or one of the short ones?<br> What if I told you<br> it was none of your business?<br> I'd say it was one of the long ones.<br> Like your job here?
