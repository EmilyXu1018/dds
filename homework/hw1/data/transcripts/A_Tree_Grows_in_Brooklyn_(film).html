Like that little old bird<br> right up there. Listen to him.<br> He didn't ask anybody could he sing,<br> and he certainly didn't take<br> any lessons.<br> He's so full of singing, it's just<br> got to bust out someplace.<br> Why they could cut that old tree<br> right down to the ground<br> and a root would push up<br> someplace else in the cement.<br> You wait till Spring, Prima Donna<br> and you'll see.<br> Well, this ain't winning the family<br> bread, huh?<br> Come on, ain't you got one nice<br> little wish just for yourself?<br> No, Papa. l just...<br> - Just what?<br> l just love you so much, Papa.<br> Well, what do you know.<br> Listen, if l make a lot of tips<br> tonight, you know what l'm gonna do?<br> What Papa?<br> l'm gonna put two bucks on the nose<br> of a horse l know is running Monday.<br> And l'll win ten.

What do you<br> mean, what does it mean?<br> Neeley, sit down at your place.<br> Well, why do girls always wear it<br> when they're married,<br> and when they're confirmed<br> and when they graduate?<br> Why does it always have to be white?<br> Just one of those things somebody<br> started. Lots of things like that.<br> Will l have a white dress when l<br> graduate?<br> We'll see. Neeley will probably have<br> to have shoes by that time.<br> But, Mama!<br> Well, talk to him about it.<br> lf you can get him to quit coming<br> through the soles of his shoes...<br> Just because he's a boy.<br> All right, Mama, l will gladly do<br> without so my little brother can be<br> happy with new shoes.<br> Little brother my eye...<br> That will do. Francie, you read too<br> much.<br> Hey, Aunt Sissy!<br> - What did you bring us?<br> l brought myself chickapeas, isn't<br> that enough?<br> Oh, and a couple of magazines from<br> the dentist.<br> What's he need 'em for, or me<br> either?<br> l can't read like my educated little<br> niece here.<br> Hello, Katie, my darling.<br> Good evening, sissy.<br> Well, you look fine, Katie.<br> Yeah, l look fine.<br> Who spilled the beans.

You and Johnny.<br> Oh, look, Katie.<br> l didn't tell you because l wanted<br> to bring Bill around.<br> But, l couldn't. He's home sleeping.<br> He's a milk man, you see.<br> Ah, listen.

The<br> works.<br> l'm a disgrace.<br> You don't know what to do with me.<br> You can hardly face the neighbors<br> with what they must be saying.<br> l'm old enough to know better.<br> Go on, get it all off your chest, then<br> we can make up and forget about it.<br> That's right. Talk your way out of<br> it. You probably will, too.<br> What'd Mama have to say?<br> Well, you know Mama,<br> she don't say much.<br> Oh, sure, l know Mama.<br> Says that you're bad, only where the<br> men are concerned but<br> she's good in her heart.<br> oh, but that ain't it, Sissy.<br> People got a right to talk, and the<br> kids are bound to hear,<br> and it ain't right for them.<br> And you can get in trouble.<br> You ain't real sure what happened.<br> And there's laws about things like<br> that...<br> Katie, so help me, this time it's<br> for keeps.<br> l ain't even gonna look at another<br> guy.<br> And as for the last one, he can't be<br> alive,<br> or l would have heard from him.<br> l've been pretty good.<br> Seven years is a long time to wait<br> around not being married.<br> They said all you had to wait was<br> seven years. And l waited.<br> Well, for the life of me, l don't<br> know what you're trying to talk<br> yourself into, but l got a feeling<br> it ain't right.<br> All l know, is it can't be wrong or<br> l wouldn't feel like l do about it.<br> l'm dumb, sure, but l know this much:<br> lf l feel bad about something,<br> it's wrong.<br> lf l feel good, it's right.

As soon as<br> we heard Mrs. Waters was vacating,<br> we made up our minds.<br> l've been waiting to see you, Mrs.<br> Nolan.<br> There's something l've got to ask<br> you, a favor l...<br> l'd better show you.<br> Hey, look at this thing.<br> Oh boy, we're sure to get out with a<br> lot less running up and down that.<br> We won't let anybody but us up there.<br> lt's in here. The late Mr. Waters<br> gave it to me as a wedding present.<br> lt won't go down the stairs, and<br> they want fifteen dollars to move it,<br> lowering it out the window.<br> Do you mind my leaving it, Mrs.<br> Nolan?<br> lt don't take up much room and some<br> day when l get the fifteen dollars,<br> l'll send back for it.<br> Why, sure l don't mind, Mrs. Waters.<br> Can you play it?<br> No. Neither one of us could.<br> lf it ain't too much trouble, you<br> could dust it off once in a while,<br> and keep the kitchen door open a<br> little so it won't get cold or damp.<br> l sure will.<br> - Thank you.<br> And l hope it won't be long before<br> you can send back for it.<br> Have you got the curtains?<br> Yes, they're coming.<br> ls it a... ls that a...<br> Yeah, we kept a baby in it about 40<br> years ago.<br> Well, l was just wondering, if, if,<br> if you don't need it, it'd make a<br> nice handy little wash basket and<br> l'd be happy to give you a quarter<br> for it.<br> Why sure. My Edgar's kids is even<br> too old.<br> Excuse me for asking, Mrs. Nolan,<br> but it won't really make a<br> handy wash basket.<br> Please don't say nothing, l ain't<br> told nobody yet.<br> lt ain't always easy when you're<br> poor.

Welcome to your new<br> home.<br> Yeah, it is kind of a surprise, all<br> right.<br> Did you move up here because it was<br> cheaper, or because l<br> We have to save where we can,<br> somebody's got to.<br> l don't mind the extra stairs.<br> We can still see the tree.<br> Pop, top floor tenant, the roof is<br> theirs.<br> And l ain't gonna let anybody up<br> there except Kenny Gaddis, because,<br> Hey, does Pop know?<br> Flossie Gaddis died last night.<br> Oh, the poor baby.<br> lt was nice that her Mama got her<br> all those pretty dresses.<br> Only now the poor thing will have to<br> lie in Potter's Field.<br> But, she did have the dresses.<br> You better show your Papa the piano.<br> Yeah, you better show me the piano,<br> Prima Donna.<br> The lady that was here left it.<br> lt's got a nice tone.<br> lt's all right.<br> Hey, now that we got it, maybe you<br> can take some lessons. Naa...<br> Maxwelton Braes are bonny<br> where early forms the dew.<br> And was there that Annie Lorrie gave<br> me a promise true.<br> Gave me a promise true, which ne'er<br> forget will be,<br> and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,<br> l would lay me down and dee.<br> l ain't never heard you sing that<br> before. lt's pretty.<br> Maxwelton Braes are bonny, where<br> early forms the dew.<br> And was there that Annie Lorrie gave<br> me a promise true.<br> Gave me a promise true,<br> which ne'er forget will be,<br> and for Bonny Annie Lorrie,<br> l would lay me down and dee.<br> Well, this is the beginning of a<br> vacation we've all looked forward to.<br> And l'm sure we'll enjoy our<br> holidays more, knowing we've helped<br> some unfortunate family who would<br> have had no Christmas dinner without<br> this basket.<br> And so a Merry...<br> Oh, one last thing, this extra pie,<br> Miss Schilling brought in.<br> lt's little, and a bit crushed, but,<br> anybody want it?<br> My, what well fed boys and girls.<br> All right, class.<br> Miss McDonald?<br> Yes, Frances?<br> l just remembered. l know a very<br> unfortunate family.<br> They live in a, in a hovel. They<br> have two children.<br> Little golden-haired twins. And<br> they're all starving.<br> The pie will probably save their<br> lives.<br> Well, then you should take the pie<br> by all means.<br> You can come and get it when class<br> is dismissed.<br> Which is right now.<br> And Merry Christmas to you all.<br> That was a very fine Christmas<br> spirit, Frances.<br> But it seems like such a tiny pie to<br> save so many lives.<br> Oh, it won't seem small to them,<br> Miss McDonald.<br> Even a little pie can look awful big<br> if you haven't had much to eat<br> for days and days.<br> l'll have to tell them to eat slowly,<br> because they eat very fast on an<br> empty stomach they'll, they'll...<br> lt isn't true, it's all a lie.<br> l wanted it for myself.<br> l'll stay after school, l'll do<br> anything, but don't send a note home.<br> l'm not going to punish you child,<br> for being hungry<br> or having an imagination.<br> You know, that's something very few<br> people have.<br> lt's very precious.<br> But it can also be dangerous unless<br> we learn how to use it.<br> Our everyday lives are real and true,<br> but all the stories in the world,<br> all the music, came out of<br> someone's imagination.<br> So, if we tell the truth, and write<br> the lies,<br> then they aren't lies<br> anymore, they become stories.<br> Like some of the very nice<br> compositions you've written, Frances.<br> Like the one about<br> my father taking me<br> to see the cotton fields<br> down south?<br> We didn't really go.<br> l rather imagined you didn't.<br> But don't you think it would be<br> still better<br> if you would write about the things<br> you really know about<br> and then add to them with<br> your imagination.<br> Even stories shouldn't be<br> just, well, pipe dreams.<br> Pipe dreamers can be very lovable<br> people but they don't help anybody.<br> But they don't help anybody. Now,<br> think about it a little.<br> And have a Merry Christmas.<br> And enjoy your pie.<br> Yes, Miss McDonald.<br> Thank you, Miss McDonald.<br> For Gos sakes. Where've you been?<br> You were supposed to meet me...<br> Neeley, l'm going to be a writer.<br> All right, but let's eat the pie.<br> Come on, we gotta see about our<br> Christmas tree.<br> Oh, golly, lit's still there,<br> isn't it?<br> Yeah, it's still here.<br> He ain't got much time<br> left to sell it.<br> Go on, beat it. You know l ain't<br> gonna throw 'em til midnight.<br> What do you want to do, block the<br> sidewalk?<br> Keep customers out?<br> Ah, you don't own the sidewalk!<br> How about this one, madam?<br> No, that one's too big.<br> l want a small one.<br> l got just what you want,<br> come over here, lady.<br> Well, now, that's more like it.<br> That's the size.<br> lt's awful big to get thrown at you.<br> Why does he have to throw 'em at us,<br> anyway?<br> Why can't he can't just give 'em to<br> us, if he can't sell 'em?<br> lf he just gave 'em away,<br> everybody'd wait.<br> They'd never sell any of 'em.<br> lt smells good.<br> There she goes!<br> Hey, l'll do it again!<br> l stumbled!<br> Go on! Beat it! Who's next?<br> Come on, give me a chance, l'm next.<br> All right. Here she goes.<br> Got it, didn't l?<br> All right, take it. Go home. Now,<br> who wants to try this one?<br> Who's man enough for this big one<br> right here?<br> l can take anything you got,<br> mister. Let her fly...<br> l'm next! That's my tree!<br> Go on, you're too small! Go home!<br> Me and my brother, we ain't too<br> small together.<br> Spunky huh?<br> All right, but if one of you drop,<br> you're not gonna get the tree.<br> There she goes!<br> Okay, you got it coming.

You better take the coffee in.<br> You're a fine girl, Katie. l never<br> said any different.<br> That's for nothing, Johnny. Except<br> for being a nice guy.<br> Coffee everybody!<br> Well, l guess that's about all.<br> Johnny, l gotta tell you something.<br> Maybe it ain't the right time, and<br> maybe it is.<br> The reason l moved us up here, we're<br> gonna have a baby, Johnny,<br> that's why l've been scrimping<br> so much and trying so hard to say.<br> well, that's...! . Well, l'm awful<br> glad, Katie, if you are.<br> There's a lot we've got to think<br> about, Johnny.<br> Oh, l know, but we'll make out.<br> Maybe things will be different.<br> And we'll have one to grow up with<br> all over again.<br> l got things all figured out.<br> l ought to be able to work until,<br> well anyway, April.<br> And then Francie'll have to leave<br> school<br> and take out her working papers.<br> She's young, but with what she can<br> make, we ought to be able to make out<br> Oh, but we can't do that, Katie<br> l don't like it any better than you<br> do, Johnny, but l thought<br> and l thought, and there<br> ain't no other way.<br> And Johnny, you got to help with<br> something. She listens to you.<br> You gotta quit getting her so all<br> excited about her school.<br> Why can't it be Neeley? He's the boy,<br> and he don't care like she does.<br> Well, maybe that's why.<br> Maybe it'll do her good to get out<br> in the world and learn something,<br> learn how to take care of herself,<br> learn something practical<br> while she's young.<br> She's gotta learn some day.<br> Well, well, there must be another<br> way. Oh, l don't know.<br> l'll try and swing anything. l'll do<br> anything.<br> We can't count on that, Johnny...<br> Don't look at me like that, Johnny,<br> it ain't my fault!<br> Oh, it ain't your fault either,<br> l guess. l don't know.<br> Anyway, one member of the Nolan<br> family will get to graduate,<br> and she come close.<br> That's something.<br> You'd better put out the light and<br> let's get some rest.<br> Oh, l thought you'd be asleep, Prima<br> Donna.<br> Ah-ah. l've been thinking. l might<br> be going to be a writer.<br> l've just about decided.<br> l knew you when you was going to be<br> a lady fireman.<br> Don't joke, Papa. l'm serious.<br> All right, l baby.<br> All l meant was, maybe it's better<br> not to get your heart set...<br> on just one thing, in case<br> something happens.<br> She said, Miss McDonald, l mean, she<br> said maybe l could be.<br> She said l have imagination.<br> Do you think l have, Papa?<br> Oh, sure you have, baby.<br> Those compositions of yours are sure<br> fine, but...<br> She said l'd have to work hard.<br> She said imagination<br> wasn't any good if<br> you were just a pipe<br> dreamer about it.<br> You didn't help anybody that way.<br> Not even yourself, she said.<br> Yeah, l see. A pipe dreamer.<br> l'm not putting it good like she did.<br> l wish you could have heard her.<br> She was wonderful.<br> For ever and ever l'll be glad you<br> helped me go to that school, Papa.<br> You kind of like that school, don't<br> you, baby?<br> Yes, oh yes. And she said lots more.<br> l've been trying to remember.<br> She said, even if you have<br> imagination;<br> it's better to write about<br> the things you know about<br> so they'll be true, and...<br> and the way things are only.<br> Only what, baby?<br> Papa, the people in the hall when we<br> brought up the tree,<br> the look on their faces<br> all friendly and nice.<br> Why can't people be like that all<br> the time? Not just on Christmas?<br> Well, l guess it's because...<br> Well, l don't know.<br> Maybe it's because Christmas is like<br> people really<br> are and the other part ain't true.<br> And with that imagination of yours,<br> if you think about it hard enough,<br> you know, like it ought to be.<br> But when you get to thinking.<br> Papa, the people in stories, they<br> don't just live happily ever after,<br> do they?<br> No, baby, but...<br> But the trouble is...<br> it doesn't feel good when<br> you think about things like that.<br> l mean, like they really are.<br> You better stick out your tongue,<br> Prima Donna.<br> Oh, it's just like l thought. You've<br> got a bad case.<br> A very bad case.<br> Case of what, Papa?<br> A very bad case of growing up.<br> That's all it is.<br> Oh it ain't fun some times, but,<br> don't you be afraid.<br> l don't want you should ever be<br> afraid.<br> You're so nice, Papa.<br> l guess it's better if you don't<br> just stay young all your life.<br> lt'll be much nicer growing up.<br> Yeah. And you get to see things<br> like they really are.<br> Good night, baby.<br> Good night, Papa. l'm sleepy now.<br> That's fine, baby. Just fine.<br> Ain't you coming to bed, Johnny?<br> No, l'm going to take a little walk.<br> Don't start drinking,<br> not tonight, Johnny.<br> l won't, Katie, l won't.<br> Well, did he go out on a job,<br> do you know?<br> lf he did, he didn't get it through<br> us.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, how are you, Mrs. Nolan,<br> and a Happy New Year to you.<br> Same to you, Mr. McGarrity.<br> l just came to.<br> well, l happened to be passing by<br> and l thought l'd run in and thank<br> you for the candy canes you sent us.<br> lt was nice of you.<br> Oh, that's all right. lt wasn't much.<br> Well, it was nice of you. Good night,<br> Mr. McGarrity.<br> Good night, Mrs. Nolan. Mrs. Nolan,<br> Johnny ain't here.<br> He ain't been here since before<br> Christmas.<br> Oh, l'm afraid it's bad news l'm<br> bringing you, Mrs. Nolan.<br> Our station just got a report that<br> Mr. Nolan was found<br> over in Manhattan, very sick.<br> He's been taken to a hospital.<br> See that Neeley gets to school on<br> time in the morning.<br> There's an apple for your lunches.<br> The report says that he just<br> collapsed,<br> right in the doorway of<br> an employment agency.<br> And he'd just been going out on a<br> job, as sand hog in a tunnel, they said.<br> And he hadn't been drinking, ma'am.<br> He'd been waiting there a long time<br> for the job.<br> He was just sick.<br> We did everything we could.<br> Yeah, sure, l know.<br> What are you writing down that he<br> died from, Doctor?<br> Acute alcoholism and pneumonia.<br> One led to the other.<br> l don't want you to write down that<br> he died like that.<br> Put just the pneumonia.<br> l can't do that.<br> Pneumonia was the direct cause of<br> death, but the alcoholism was...<br> Look, he's dead.<br> l've got two nice kids that are going<br> to grow up to amount to something.<br> Why do you have to make it hard by<br> saying that their father<br> died from the drink when that's<br> only a little piece of the truth?<br> He wasn't drinking, they said so.<br> He was out looking for work.<br> Why can't you put that down?<br> Cause of death: pneumonia.<br> Everlasting rest and happiness,<br> through the infinite merits<br> of Jesus Christ.<br> Oh, God,<br> great and omnipotent judge of the<br> living and the dead,<br> if all whom we are to appear<br> after this short life,<br> to render an account of our worth,<br> let our hearts we pray to be deeply<br> wounded at the sight of this death,<br> and while we consign the body of the<br> deceased to the earth,<br> let us be mindful of our own frailties<br> and mortality,<br> that walking always in thy fear and<br> in the ways of thy commandments,<br> we may after our departure from this world,<br> experience<br> a merciful judgement and rejoice<br> in everlasting happiness.<br> Through Christ our lord.<br> All them people, and the flowers.<br> Some of them from people l never<br> heard of even.<br> Who'd have thought, that many folks.<br> l mean they was carrying on like<br> they was his family, or...<br> or... l don't know.<br> Yeah, he took the time to make a lot<br> of people love him all right.<br> lt's hard to figure out so many of<br> them showing up.<br> And they was feeling something.<br> l mean, there was no reason for them<br> to put on.<br> He was nobody big, he was just a...<br> Katie, don't talk about it no more,<br> kid.<br> Francis!<br> Let's leave her be, Katie. She<br> maybe wants to be by herself.<br> She's taking on kind of funny, she<br> ain't even cried.<br> l'd like my father's shaving cup.<br> That one, "Nolan".<br> Oh, you're the little girl. Yes,<br> l'll clean it up for you.<br> He was a fine man.<br> Tell your Mama that l,<br> his barber, said this.<br> Francis...<br> What?<br> Francis, do you know where you're<br> going?<br> No place.<br> Francis?<br> Yes, Mama?<br> lt was nice of the neighbors to send<br> over all that food,<br> don't you want something?<br> No, Mama.<br> l wanted to talk to you, Francie.<br> l want things to go on,<br> reading and all. l want to do...<br> Well, l gotta be Mama and Papa both<br> to you now, Francie.<br> Yes, Mama. ls that all, Mama?<br> Well, you gotta go right now,<br> Francie.<br> l'll be back. Honest l will.<br> Mom, l guess l'm a little hungry.<br> Look, he can't be dead. He can't.<br> They don't understand.<br> Maybe you could let me have a baby<br> some day, and it could be a boy,<br> so it could be just like him.<br> lt'd have to be me.<br> Nobody else loved him like l do.<br> Maybe you could do that for me. And<br> if you could, he wouldn't even die.<br> l hope you don't think l'm forward<br> coming in like this, Mrs. Nolan.<br> How are you, Francie?<br> l'm well, thank you.<br> Have a chair. Francie, see if Mr.<br> McGarrity won't have some coffee.<br> Not for me, thank you.<br> l figured l'd ought to come.<br> l suppose you know how Johnny<br> and l done business.<br> He used to give me money to keep<br> and then draw against it.<br> l got to looking around.<br> And... what do you think?<br> l had pretty near 5 bucks<br> in his box.<br> Ando so l figured<br> it belongs to you.<br> lt'd more likely be<br> that he owed you.<br> But thank you very much.<br> l just thought...<br> - We'll make out.<br> There's something else, then.<br> Maybe you wouldn't mind if...<br> if Francie and Neeley<br> come down and work for me,<br> afternoons like. l mean,<br> after school and Saturdays.<br> Maybe it isn't just the place<br> you'd favour them working,<br> but l'd keep an eye on them.<br> And l could pay them<br> l'd take it<br> as a real favour, Madame.<br> You're an awful bad liar.<br> But you're a very good man.<br> l'm ashamed l didn't know before.<br> No, it isn't that, Madame.<br> Johnny was...<br> Well, l don't know. Johnny...<br> Johnny always talked<br> about his family like...<br> like folks ought to,<br> only they don't.<br> And whenever he talked about it<br> he always made you<br> feel better,<br> or you wanted to laugh.<br> laugh. Like that sea shell l had<br> there.<br> He was always... he was always<br> listening to it and...<br> and telling you what it was saying.<br> He was always giving things like<br> that to people.<br> He was a fine man, Mrs. Nolan.<br> l'd a glad to let the children work<br> for you, Mr. McCarrity.<br> And the four dollars a week will<br> keep us until the baby comes.<br> And Francie won't have to quit<br> school, she can keep on,<br> and they can both...<br> Well, it's a deal, then.<br> And you tell them to come through<br> the family entrance tomorrow after<br> school and ah...<br> ls that all right with you, Francie?<br> Yes.<br> Well, ah, well it's settled then,<br> and good day to you, Mrs. Nolan.<br> And thank you again, Mr. McGarrity.<br> Francie?<br> Yes, Mama?<br> l'm glad you can keep on with your<br> school.<br> l was hoping something like this<br> would happen but l didn't want to<br> say anything until the time come.<br> But your Papa and l talked it all<br> over and there were reasons<br> and there just wasn't any other way.<br> lt doesn't matter. Papa saved one<br> from it.<br> Hi-ya, kid.<br> Well, they're sure taking chances l<br> wouldn't, leaving you handling meat.<br> Where's France.<br> Hello, kid. How are you lamb? Look,<br> you gotta do something for me.<br> This was in the paper and l cut it<br> out.<br> You got to read it to me.<br> What's the matter, hon?<br> Nothing, l'm all right, Aunt Sissy.<br> No, you ain't. You ain't been since...<br> Look, don't you think you better<br> spill it to your Aunt Sissy?<br> What is it you want me to read to<br> you, Aunt Sissy?<br> Well, we'll get that out of the way<br> first. Look, here it is.<br> Likely you don't remember him, but<br> it's my last husband, Bill.<br> The one l thought was dead,<br> but he ain't.<br> He's got his picture in there and l<br> want to know what it says.<br> Maybe it says where he lives so's l<br> can write to him about getting a ...<br> ... divorce or something.<br> l got the best husband in all the<br> world now,<br> and l don't want this here one<br> bobbing up and making no trouble.<br> He's a fireman someplace. l can tell<br> that from his clothes.<br> He was just starting out in the<br> fireman business...<br> lt says he's a hero. He saved some<br> people in a fire.<br> Does it say where?<br> The ninth precinct. Manhattan.<br> Manhattan, huh? Couldn't make the<br> grade in Brooklyn, l guess.<br> l want you to write to him, Francie.<br> Write this: "Dear Bill...<br> This says his name is Roland Polasky.<br> That's right. l remember. Make it<br> "Dear Mr. Polasky.<br> Being's as now l'm married to<br> somebody else, l want you to see<br> about getting a real legal divorce.<br> Because l thought you was dead but<br> you ain't.<br> And because you got the money now on<br> account of the reward.<br> Yours very truly, Sissy." Something<br> like that.<br> But Aunt Sissy, he must have already<br> done that.<br> Because it says here he's married<br> again.<br> lt does?<br> "On the human interest side of the<br> story,<br> Mrs. Polasky had returned home only<br> the day before from the hospital,<br> after presenting Mr. Polasky with<br> a brand new son,<br> the fourth child of the marriage.<br> So, if he got a divorce that long<br> ago, you don't have to.<br> Then my being married to Bill, this<br> one l mean, is all legal?<br> Well, now, if that ain't a load off<br> my chest.<br> You know something, l think l'll<br> give Bill Polasky a wedding present.<br> But Aunt Sissy, you can't. He's been<br> married for years.<br> Four kids, huh? Must be a sickly<br> woman, this Mrs. Polasky,<br> going to the hospital just<br> to have a baby.<br> Oh, no, lots of people go there now<br> to have babies. lt's better.<br> Sure enough? You know something?<br> l'm gonna cash in my funeral policy<br> and have my baby at a hospital.<br> And when my baby is born, and lives,<br> l want you to write that R. Polasky<br> and announce it.<br> Boy do l feel better.<br> And now, chickapea, we'll talk about<br> you.<br> Can't your Aunt Sissy help you any?<br> l'm all right.<br> No, you aren't honey.<br> Not all shut up like that, l know<br> how you feel,<br> but you can't keep hanging on to it.<br> l'm ail right. l don't want to talk<br> about it.<br> All right, baby. All right. But l'll<br> tell you what.<br> You can do something for me.<br> Look, your Mama feels awful bad too.<br> She needs you.<br> Why don't you talk to her about it.<br> She doesn't need me.<br> No she doesn't.<br> She's got Neeley!<br> Why wasn't it Neeley she was going<br> to make quit school.<br> He never cared about it.<br> She doesn't love me like Papa did.<br> And she didn't love him, either. Not<br> really.<br> She hurt him, l saw her. And he<br> never hurt anybody.<br> l'm gonna finish this grade because<br> he gave it to me<br> and then l'll work for her.<br> But she can't be Papa to me, she<br> can't ever!<br> Don't feel like that, baby, don't.<br> Leave me alone. l'm all right.<br> Please go away and leave me alone.<br> All right, chickapea, all right.<br> Ah, Mr. Sterns...<br> Yes, sir.<br> Francie...<br> Yes, Mama?<br> l want to talk to you, Francie.<br> Yes, Mama?<br> lt isn't going to be long now, for<br> me, l mean, for my baby.<br> We can't come to a hospital.<br> There isn't even going to be enough<br> money for a woman to come and help.<br> l'm going to need you, Francie.<br> Don't ever be far away.<br> Neeley's, well, a boy ain't much<br> good at a time like this.<br> l'm counting on you, Francie.<br> You won't forget that, will you?<br> All right, Mama. l'll remember.<br> Which one of you is Mr. Steven<br> Edwards?<br> That's me.<br> Well, there are three in your family<br> now.<br> You are the father of a pretty fine<br> boy.<br> ls he alive?<br> - Very much so.<br> He was a little reluctant about it<br> at first, l had to rouse him with a<br> little oxygen, now he's mad at me,<br> you ought to hear him.<br> l've got to see him.<br> Well, neither one of them are quite<br> up to a visit just now,<br> in a little while.<br> The learning. The learning that<br> saved that baby.<br> That's fine, Bill.<br> Where are you going, Uncle Bill?<br> l'm going out and get some<br> strawberry ice cream<br> and a rattle for my son.<br> And what's more, my name ain't Bill.<br> lt's Steve, do you hear that? l'm a<br> Papa and my name's Steve.<br> And it's Uncle Steve, too. Steve,<br> Steve...<br> So, we have a man in the family.<br> Quick as we see she's all right,<br> you go on up to McGarrity's and<br> see if you can do my work, too.<br> l'm going to finish the scrubbing<br> for her.<br> She oughtn't do any more.<br> She wasn't feeling good this morning.<br> Mama!<br> Mama!<br> ln here, Frances.<br> You all right, Mama?<br> Give Neeley a nickel to go after<br> Grandma and Sissy.<br> He can walk home after.<br> Get me a nightgown in that bottom<br> drawer.<br> Hurry, don't stand there staring.<br> ls she going to die?<br> Of course not, it's the baby. You<br> heard what Mama said, and hurry.<br> And don't forget stopping at<br> McGarrity's on the way back.<br> We can't lose the work. She only<br> wants me now. Mama!<br> What is it?<br> Oh, l'll be there in a minute.<br> You're taking real good care of me,<br> Francie.<br> Am l, Mama?<br> Umm. Tastes good.<br> Can l get you a glass of water,<br> Mama?<br> When l want something,<br> l'll ask for it.<br> Yes, Mama.<br> Don't just stand there and throw<br> questions at me, l'm too tired.<br> You'd better have some coffee too.<br> Mama, even if Neeley is a boy,<br> wouldn't you rather have him here?<br> He's always such a comfort to you.<br> No, it's you that's a comfort now.<br> What time is it?<br> l don't know, Mama.<br> Get the clock.<br> one minute to Mama.<br> Are you sure it isn't slow?<br> No, Mama.<br> Maybe it's fast, then.<br> l'll look at the jeweler's clock out<br> the parlor window.<br> That candle's pretty, like Christmas.<br> That was the night l told him.<br> lt's nice having a visit from my<br> daughter.<br> l didn't want for you to have to<br> grow up so soon.<br> l didn't want for you to have to<br> quit school.<br> l tried to tell him that.<br> He didn't mind about the baby, but<br> he never forgived me<br> for wanting you to quit school.<br> l told him and he just went out. You<br> never forgived me, either.<br> Please don't, Mama.<br> He would have bought you dolls<br> instead of milk.<br> l don't know, maybe you would have<br> been happier. l don't know.<br> l never woulve thought of giving<br> you that school, like he did.<br> And all them fine compositions of<br> yours. l never read one of 'em.<br> l shoulda had time. Johnny did.<br> But l couldn't do no different.<br> l don't know how l could do any<br> different.<br> What time is it?<br> One minute after four, Mama.<br> Rinse a cloth out in cold water,<br> wipe my face.<br> Don't let her die, please!<br> Mama, what if the baby comes before<br> Grandma and Aunt Sissy get here?<br> You can see l couldn't do no<br> different, can't you?<br> Neeley, he don't like school.<br> lf he'd quit, he'd never go back<br> again.<br> But you, no matter what happens,<br> you'd find a way to go back,<br> you'd fight to go back.<br> You can see that, can't you?<br> l... Yes, Mama.<br> Read me something, Francie.<br> - Yes, Mama.<br> Read me one of your compositions.<br> l ain't never read any of your<br> compositions.<br> lt's on my conscience.<br> l tore all those up.<br> No, you didn't. Not all of'em.<br> Can't l read you Shakespeare? lt's<br> much better.<br> Read "Twas on a Night Like This".<br> l'd like to have something pretty on<br> my mind. Sit by the candle.<br> "The moon shines bright,<br> in such a night as this,<br> when the sweet wind did<br> gently kiss the trees..."<br> Say, did you ever find out who<br> Troylis was and Cressida?<br> Yes, Mama, Troylis was...<br> Some other day when l got time. Read<br> me one of your compositions now.<br> You won't like them, Mama.<br> You thought about them, and you<br> worked on them,<br> and you got good marks on them.<br> Get 'em, l said.<br> Sit here. Go on.<br> lt's called, "The Man People Loved".<br> Please don't make me do this, Mama.<br> Read it.<br> "Perhaps many people might have said<br> of him that he was a failure.<br> lt is true that he had no gift for<br> making money,<br> but he had a gift for laughter,<br> and for making people love him.<br> He had the gift of making you feel<br> proud to walk down the street with him<br> He had nothing to give but himself.<br> But of this he gave generously, like<br> a king.<br> Like a king. That's like it was.<br> Walking down the street with him,<br> you always felt like that.<br> Did you, Mama.<br> You were real smart to write it down<br> like that, Francie.<br> That's like it was. Francie, l miss<br> him so much!<br> lf the baby's a boy, we'll call him<br> Johnny. Where's Sissy?<br> Neeley's been gone a long time. Wipe<br> my face.<br> No, don't let go of my hand.<br> lf it's a girl, we'll call her Annie<br> Lorrie.<br> Remember that tune he played? You<br> ought to have piano lessons.<br> l'll see if l can manage.<br> You won't forget to dust the piano,<br> will you Francie?<br> Who'll cry for me like that if l<br> died?<br> l never did a wrong thing in my life,<br> but it ain't enough.<br> Oh! Sissy, l didn't mean to be hard,<br> like you said!<br> lf Johnny were here, he could go to<br> your graduation, and l'd go to<br> Neeley's, but l, l can't tear myself<br> into two pieces.<br> How am l going to do both? Oh!<br> Where are you, Francie!<br> l'm here, Mama!<br> Oh, you're such a comfort to me.<br> l'm so tired. Leave me sleep now.<br> You'd better start some water<br> boiling,<br> she's going to be needing it.<br> We'll call you if there's anything<br> we need.<br> l thought you were never coming,<br> Sissy.<br> Come on, you quit worrying, now.<br> The baby is here and the Mama is<br> doing good. She's asleep.<br> A small baby sister it is.<br> Annie Lorrie. Papa would have liked<br> that.<br> Where's Grandma?<br> l've got her in a front seat so she<br> won't miss a thing.<br> lsn't your classroom around here<br> somewhere?<br> Yes, but...<br> How about giving me a peek?<br> Wouldn't hurt me none seeing a<br> little more places like that.<br> Hey, Francie, you forgot your<br> flowers.<br> They aren't mine, l'm not carrying<br> flowers today.<br> Some of the girls, their family<br> sends them flowers.<br> They're on your desk, lamb. Better<br> go see.<br> Oh well, l have to get my things,<br> anyway.<br> "To Francie on graduation day, love<br> from Papa."<br> He gave me the money to buy them way<br> before Christmas.<br> To make sure he had it, he said.<br> Then he wrote out the card.<br> Come on, Kid.<br> Let it go, baby, there ain't a soul<br> around here. Let it go.<br> Frances Nolan.<br> Well, sir, l don't think Grandma<br> said one word the whole time.<br> And from the looks of her when l put<br> her on the street car, she'll<br> probably ride clear out to Coney<br> lsland and never know the difference.<br> Heaven knows what she would have<br> been like<br> if she'd got to both graduations.<br> Looks to me like it was a pretty<br> fine day. How's your soda, Francie?<br> Pineapple's not as good as chocolate.<br> Then what'd you order it for?<br> Because l'm up to the "Ps". Next<br> time l'll try raspberry next.<br> There's something to that idea. Try<br> everything once.<br> Sissy!<br> And a dime for you, my boy. This is<br> a special occasion. Thank you.<br> He don't know how special it is.<br> Two diplomas in the Nolan family all<br> in one day.<br> Mama, l've got a nickel if you want<br> to leave it. People do.<br> lt's going to be all right, Francie.<br> And you know something, these ain't<br> gonna be the last diplomas, either.<br> l don't know how we're gonna work it,<br> but we're gonna find<br> some way for you and...<br> Hi, Neeley, how ya doing?<br> Okay, l got out of jail.<br> Say, wasn't that you l saw working<br> behind that bat the other day?<br> Well, yeah, but...<br> Hey, you were pretty good.<br> You know what?<br> l can come out and give you some<br> pointers some time.<br> Honest?<br> Sure l will. That is, if your mom<br> don't mind.<br> Naw, she don't mind. You mean it?<br> Sure. Well, l'll see you on the lot.<br> Maybe you better ask your ma, you<br> know,<br> l don't want to do anything<br> she wouldn't want me to.<br> Naw, she won't care.<br> Maybe you'd better ask her yourself,<br> just to make sure.<br> l'm Neeley's aunt, this is his ma,<br> but that's his sister.<br> What's-your name, big boy?<br> Hershel Knudsen.<br> Mr. Knudsen, l'd like for you to<br> meet my niece, Miss Francie Nolan.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> Hello.<br> Nice night if it don't rain.
