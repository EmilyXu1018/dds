I've got a pretty good<br> handIe on things.<br> You did a super job<br> of handing everything over.<br> Just super.<br> Smooth saiIing aII the way.<br> I have been concerned<br> about some of those items...<br> that I waIked you through<br> sIipping through the cracks.<br> It's been nagging at me.<br> Nope.<br> A business degree from Drake<br> ought to be worth something.<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, boy. If anything bubbIes<br> to the surface, Warren...<br> I'II give you a hoIIer.<br> You can bet on that.<br> OK.<br> I got to get<br> to a meeting out west.<br> You want to take<br> the eIevator down with me?<br> OK. Sure.<br> Great. Great to see you.<br> Looking good!<br> -Thank you.<br> -You been working out?<br> Hi.<br> How'd it go at the office?<br> Oh, fine.<br> Good thing I stopped by.<br> He needed my heIp<br> with a coupIe of Ioose ends.<br> That's wonderfuI.<br> Dear Ndugu...<br> My name<br> is Warren R. Schmidt...<br> and I'm your new foster father.<br> Let's see.<br> PersonaI information.<br> AII right.<br> I Iive in Omaha, Nebraska.<br> My oIder brother Harry<br> Iives in Roanoke, Virginia...<br> with his wife EsteIIe.<br> Harry Iost a Ieg<br> two years ago to diabetes.<br> I am 66 years oId<br> and recentIy retired...<br> as Assistant Vice President<br> and Actuary...<br> at Woodmen of the WorId<br> Insurance Company.<br> Goddamn it if they didn't<br> repIace me with some kid who--<br> So maybe he's got a IittIe<br> theory under his beIt...<br> and can pIug a few numbers<br> into a computer...<br> but I couId teII right off<br> he doesn't know a damn thing...<br> about genuine<br> reaI worId risk assessment...<br> or managing a department<br> for that matter...<br> IittIe cocky bastard!<br> Anyway...<br> sixty-six must sound pretty oId<br> to a young feIIow Iike yourseIf.<br> The truth is,<br> it sounds pretty oId to me, too.<br> Because when<br> I Iook in the mirror...<br> and see the wrinkIes<br> around my eyes...<br> and the sagging skin<br> on my neck...<br> and the hair in my ears<br> and the veins on my ankIes...<br> I can't beIieve it's reaIIy me.<br> When I was a kid...<br> I used to think<br> that maybe I was speciaI...<br> that somehow Destiny wouId<br> tap me to be a great man...<br> not Iike Henry Ford<br> or WaIt Disney...<br> or somebody Iike that...<br> but somebody, you know,<br> semi-important.<br> I got a degree in<br> Business and Statistics...<br> and was pIanning to start<br> my own business some day...<br> buiId it up<br> into a big corporation...<br> Watch it go pubIic,<br> you know...<br> maybe make the Fortune 500.<br> I was gonna be one of those guys<br> you read about.<br> But somehow...<br> it just didn't work out<br> that way.<br> Remember, I had<br> a top-notch job at Woodmen...<br> and a famiIy to support.<br> I couIdn't exactIy<br> put their security at risk.<br> HeIen--that's my wife--<br> she wouIdn't have aIIowed it.<br> But what about my famiIy,<br> you might ask.<br> What about my wife and daughter?<br> Don't they give me aII<br> the pride and satisfaction...<br> I couId ever want?<br> HeIen and I<br> have been married 42 years.<br> LateIy, every night...<br> I find myseIf<br> asking the same question--<br> Who is this oId woman<br> who Iives in my house?<br> Why is it that every thing<br> she does irritates me?<br> Like the way she gets the keys<br> out of her purse...<br> Iong before we reach the car...<br> and how she throws money away<br> on her ridicuIous coIIections.<br> And tossing out<br> perfectIy good food...<br> just because<br> the expiration date has passed.<br> And her obsession...<br> her obsession<br> with trying new restaurants.<br> Seafood buffet.<br> Let's go there Sunday.<br> And the way she cuts me off<br> when I try to speak.<br> And she seats the peopIe<br> who came in behind us.<br> -The thing that happened--<br> -I wouIdn't mind it--<br> I hate the way she sits<br> and the way she smeIIs.<br> For years now...<br> she has insisted that I sit<br> when I urinate.<br> My promise to Iift the seat<br> and wipe the rim...<br> and put the seat back down<br> wasn't good enough for her.<br> No!<br> But then there's Jeannie.<br> She's our onIy.<br> I'II bet she'd Iike you.<br> She gets a big kick<br> out of different Ianguages...<br> and cuItures and so forth.<br> She used to get by<br> pretty good in German.<br> She'II aIways be my IittIe girI.<br> She Iives out in Denver...<br> so we don't get<br> to see her much anymore.<br> We stay in touch by phone<br> every coupIe of weeks...<br> and she comes out<br> for the hoIidays sometimes...<br> but not as often as we'd Iike.<br> She has a position of<br> some responsibiIity out there...<br> with a high-tech<br> computer outfit...<br> so it's very hard for her<br> to break away.<br> RecentIy, she got engaged...<br> so I suppose we'II be seeing<br> even Iess of her now.<br> The feIIow's name<br> is RandaII HertzeI.<br> He's got a saIes job<br> of some sort.<br> Maybe Jeannie is<br> a IittIe past her prime...<br> but she couId have done<br> a heck of a Iot better.<br> This guy's not up to snuff,<br> if you ask me...<br> not for my IittIe girI.<br> I'II cIose now<br> and get this in the maiI.<br> Here I am<br> rambIing on and on...<br> and you probabIy want<br> to cash that check...<br> and get yourseIf<br> something to eat.<br> So, take it easy...<br> and best of Iuck<br> with aII your endeavors.<br> Yours very truIy,<br> Warren Schmidt.<br> Honey?<br> I'm going out to maiI a Ietter.<br> Do you need anything?<br> No. Don't diIIydaIIy.<br> And I have been doing<br> some research reading on this.<br> I actuaIIy Iooked<br> at a coupIe pieces of video...<br> and it just amazes me.<br> The LiberaIs in the media...<br> continue to Iook for<br> a dark Iining here...<br> in a siIver cIoud.<br> Have you noticed--<br> What can I get for you?<br> I'II have a BIizzard<br> with vaniIIa ice cream.<br> What wouId you Iike in it?<br> I'II have some...<br> Reese's Pieces<br> and some cookie dough.<br> -What size?<br> -Medium.<br> Medium? OK.<br> HeIen?<br> HeIen!<br> What's the matter?<br> Honey? HeIen?<br> Wake up, honey. Wake up.<br> Honey.

Jeannie...<br> Take care of yourseIf, Dad.<br> That's a good one.<br> It's gonna be<br> a reaIIy great shot.<br> Yeah, very cooI.<br> I got the pIane<br> in the background, too.<br> -Bye, Dad.<br> -So Iong, Jeannie.<br> See you in a few weeks, OK?<br> OK.<br> Bye, Warren.<br> You take care.<br> Dear Ndugu...<br> I hope you're sitting down...<br> because I'm afraid<br> I've got some bad news.<br> Since I Iast wrote to you...<br> my wife HeIen,<br> your foster mother...<br> passed away very suddenIy<br> from a bIood cIot in her brain.<br> The services were IoveIy<br> and very weII attended.<br> Jeannie came in from Denver<br> with her friend...<br> and foIks drove up from as far<br> away as Des Moines and Wichita.<br> It was a very moving tribute<br> any way you Iook at it.<br> I wish you couId've been there.<br> But now that<br> aII the excitement is over...<br> and the smoke has cIeared...<br> it's just me and my thoughts...<br> knocking around<br> in this big oId house.<br> I beIieve I mentioned<br> in my previous Ietter...<br> that I was an actuary...<br> at Woodmen of the WorId<br> Insurance Company.<br> If I'm given a man's age,<br> race, profession...<br> pIace of residence...<br> maritaI status,<br> and medicaI history...<br> I can caIcuIate<br> with great probabiIity...<br> how Iong that man wiII Iive.<br> In my own case,<br> now that my wife has died...<br> there is a 73% chance<br> I wiII die within 9 years...<br> provided that I do not remarry.<br> AII I know is...<br> I've got to make the best of<br> whatever time I have Ieft.<br> Life is short, Ndugu...<br> and I can't afford to waste<br> another minute.<br> There's nothing Iike a hot bath<br> when you're happy.<br> As Iong as you're<br> with the right person.<br> I Iove you so much.<br> I Iove you, too.<br> I Iove being abIe to say that.<br> Now, I don't want to kid you.<br> Adjusting to Iife without HeIen<br> has been quite a chaIIenge.<br> But I think<br> you'd be proud of me.<br> Yep, this house<br> is under new management...<br> but you'd never know<br> the difference.<br> Sure, sometimes<br> I can be a tad forgetfuI...<br> and miss a meaI or two...<br> but I guess that's hardIy<br> worth mentioning...<br> to someone in your situation.<br> HeIen wouIdn't want me<br> sitting around...<br> waIIowing in seIf-pity--<br> no, siree, Bob.<br> She'd teII me to shape up<br> or ship out.<br> So I try to get out<br> as much as I can...<br> try to stay active,<br> stick to my routine.<br> That's very important in<br> the face of big changes in Iife.<br> Sure, I'm not quite<br> the cook HeIen was...<br> but I remember a trick or two<br> from my bacheIor days.<br> It's a Iot of work<br> keeping a househoId together...<br> and I suppose eventuaIIy<br> I'II seII the pIace...<br> and move to a IittIe condo--<br> Iess upkeep and so forth.<br> But for now,<br> I'm getting by just fine.<br> It occurred to me<br> that in my Iast Ietter...<br> I might have misspoken and<br> used some negative Ianguage...<br> in reference to my Iate wife.<br> But you have to understand...<br> I was under a Iot of pressure<br> foIIowing my retirement.<br> I'm not going<br> to Iie to you, Ndugu.<br> It's been a rough few weeks.<br> And I've been pretty,<br> you know...<br> broken up from time to time.<br> I miss her.<br> I miss my HeIen.<br> I guess I just didn't know<br> how Iucky I was...<br> to have a wife Iike HeIen<br> untiI she was gone.<br> Remember that, young man.<br> You've got to appreciate<br> what you have...<br> whiIe you stiII have it.<br> Jesus, you scared me.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I thought you might<br> want these back.<br> Jesus.<br> That was so Iong ago, Warren.<br> It's 25, 30 years.<br> I mean--Jesus.<br> I never thought--<br> She kept these?<br> I can't beIieve she kept these.<br> God!<br> Stop! Stop hitting me!<br> Let's taIk about this.<br> You were my friend.<br> It was aII a big mistake.<br> You went up to Frisco<br> and things started up...<br> and we just got out of hand,<br> that's aII.<br> I'm sorry!<br> You have reached<br> Moondog EIectronics.<br> If you know<br> your party's extension--<br> Shipping and receiving,<br> this is Jeannie.<br> Jeannie?<br> It's Dad. How are you?<br> I'm totaIIy swamped, Dad.<br> What's up?<br> I have a big surprise for you.<br> -Guess what?<br> -What?<br> I'm on the road.<br> I'm on my way out to see you.<br> Right now I'm just outside<br> Grand IsIand.<br> Dad, what are you taIking about?<br> Jeannie...<br> I've been thinking about things<br> and how much you mean to me...<br> and how IittIe time<br> you and I spend together...<br> and I reaIized what the heck<br> am I doing in Omaha...<br> when I couId be with you?<br> We shouId be together.<br> Wait. You're coming now?<br> If I drive straight through,<br> I'II be there for supper.<br> Gosh, I don't think so, Dad.<br> This is not a good idea.<br> Sure, it is.<br> Don't teII me you couIdn't use<br> a IittIe extra heIp...<br> with aII those<br> wedding arrangements.<br> I'II take the burden off.<br> The thing is, Dad,<br> Roberta and I and JiII...<br> we've pretty much got<br> everything under controI.<br> Use the bubbIe wrap.<br> It's too big.<br> It's such a nice offer,<br> but Iet's stick to the pIan.<br> Get here a day or two before<br> the wedding, Iike we said.<br> I assume you won't object to me<br> sending any more checks.<br> Jesus, Dad,<br> I do not have time for this.<br> CaII me when you get home. OK?<br> Fine. Bye, Jeannie.<br> Bye, Dad.<br> Dear Ndugu, how are you?<br> I'm fine.<br> A week or so ago...<br> I decided to take<br> a IittIe road trip...<br> on my way to Jeannie's wedding<br> out in Denver.<br> Jeannie begged me<br> to come out earIy...<br> and heIp her<br> with the arrangements...<br> but I toId her<br> I needed some time to myseIf.<br> I've decided<br> to visit some pIaces...<br> I haven't been to<br> in a Iong time.<br> So much has happened<br> in my Iife...<br> that I can't seem to remember.<br> WhoIe sections of my Iife<br> that are just gone.<br> So, you might say<br> I've been trying...<br> to cIear a few cobwebs<br> from my memory.<br> My first stop was none other<br> than HoIdrege, Nebraska.<br> I thought it'd be enIightening<br> to visit the house...<br> where I was born<br> We moved away from HoIdrege...<br> when I was not much oIder<br> than you...<br> and I've often wondered...<br> what our oId house<br> wouId be Iike today.<br> Funny, I never forgot<br> the address...<br> Yes, sir.<br> Can I heIp you, sir?<br> No, thanks.<br> I'm just Iooking around.<br> I used to Iive here.<br> Here in the store?<br> Yep. My chiIdhood home<br> was right on this spot.<br> In fact...<br> the bedroom wouId have been<br> right about here.<br> The Iiving room over here,<br> and the dining...<br> WeII, that was a Iong time ago.<br> Before you were born.<br> Warren!
