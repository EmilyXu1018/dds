                        Do I have an original thought<br> in my head? My bald head?<br> Maybe if I were happier,<br> my hair wouldn't be falling out.<br> Life is short. I need<br> to make the most of it.<br> Today is the first day<br> of the rest of my life.<br> I'm a walking clich.<br> I really need to go to the doctor,<br> have my leg checked.<br> There's something wrong.<br> A bump.<br> The dentist called again.<br> I'm way overdue.<br> If I stopped putting things off,<br> I'd be happier.<br> All I do is sit on my fat ass.<br> If my ass wasn't fat,<br> I'd be happier.<br> I wouldn't have to wear these shirts<br> with the tails out all the time.<br> Like that's fooling anyone.<br> Fat ass. I should start jogging again.<br> Five miles a day.<br> Really do it this time.<br> Maybe rock climbing.<br> I need to turn my life around.<br> What do I need to do?<br> I need to fall in love.<br> I need to have a girlfriend.<br> I need to read more,<br> improve myself.<br> What if I learned Russian<br> or something?<br> Or took up an instrument?<br> I could speak Chinese.<br> I would be the screenwriter<br> who speaks Chinese.<br> And plays the oboe.<br> That would be cool.<br> I should get my hair cut short.<br> Stop trying to fool everyone into<br> thinking I have a full head of hair.<br> How pathetic is that?<br> Just be real. Confident.<br> Isn't that what women<br> are attracted to?<br> Men don't have to be attractive.<br> But that's not true,<br> especially these days.<br> Almost as much pressure on men<br> as there is on women these days.<br> Why should I be made to feel I have<br> to apologize for my existence?<br> Maybe it's my brain chemistry.<br> Maybe that's what's wrong:<br> bad chemistry.<br> All my problems and anxiety can be<br> reduced to a chemical imbalance<br> or some kind of<br> misfiring synapses.<br> I need to get help for that.<br> But I'll still be ugly, though.<br> Nothing's gonna change that.<br> Shut up! Shut up! Okay?<br> Let's really try today<br> to solve our camera problems.<br> Keep between-take time<br> at an absolute minimum.<br> These masks are really hot. Okay?<br> I wanna be very well-heard<br> on that from everybody.<br> Don't futz unless it's absolutely<br> important to the shot, okay?<br> I don't say that for me.<br> I say that for the people sitting here<br> Thank you.<br> in the rubber.<br> I like my dress. Okay?<br> Very good.<br> So now, folks, you better<br> heed that advice.<br> Okay? Heed that advice.<br> Stand by for picture.<br> Have her rotate around the table<br> a little bit further.<br> Hold on until we're clear.<br> You. You're in the eyeline.<br> Can you please get off the stage?<br> Yeah, just bring in the six-footer.<br> What am I doing here?<br> Why did I bother to come here today?<br> Nobody even seems to know<br> my name.<br> I've been on this planet for 40 years,<br> and I don't understand a single thing.<br> Why am I here?<br> How did I get here?<br> My leg hurts.<br> I wonder if it's cancer.<br> There's a bump. I'm starting<br> to sweat. Stop sweating.<br> I've got to stop sweating.<br> Can she see it dripping<br> down my forehead?<br> She looked at my hairline.<br> She thinks I'm bald. She--<br> We think you're great.<br> Oh, wow.<br> Thanks.<br> That's nice to hear.<br> We all just loved<br> the Malkovich script.<br> Thanks. Thanks...<br> Such a unique voice.<br> Boy, I'd love to find<br> a portal into your brain.<br> Trust me, it's no fun.<br> Heh, heh.<br> So tell me your thoughts<br> on this crazy little project of ours.<br> First, I think it's a great book.<br> Laroche is a fun character.<br> Absolutely.<br> And Orlean makes orchids<br> so fascinating.<br> Plus, her musings on Florida<br> and orchid poaching, Indians.<br> It's just-- It's great,<br> sprawling New Yorker stuff.<br> I'd want to remain true to that.<br> I'd wanna let the movie exist,<br> rather than be artificially<br> plot-driven.<br> Great.<br> I guess I'm not exactly sure<br> what that means.<br> Oh.<br> I'm not sure I know<br> what that means either.<br> I don't wanna ruin it by making it<br> a Hollywood thing. You know?<br> Like an orchid heist movie<br> or something, you know?<br> Or changing the orchids<br> into poppies<br> and making it about<br> drug running.<br> Definitely.<br> Why can't there be a movie<br> simply about flowers?<br> I guess we thought that maybe<br> Susan Orlean and Laroche<br> could fall in love, and--<br> Okay. But I'm saying, it's like,<br> I don't wanna cram in sex<br> or guns or car chases,<br> you know,<br> or characters, you know,<br> learning profound life lessons.<br> Or growing,<br> or coming to like each other,<br> or overcoming obstacles to succeed<br> in the end, you know? I mean--<br> The book isn't like that<br> and life isn't like that.<br> You know, it just isn't. And-- Ahem.<br> I feel very strongly about this.<br> John Laroche is a tall guy,<br> skinny as a stick,<br> pale-eyed,<br> slouch-shouldered,<br> sharply handsome, despite the fact<br> he's missing all his front teeth.<br> I went to Florida two years ago<br> to write a piece for The New Yorker.<br> After reading a small article about a<br> white man and three Seminole men<br> arrested with rare orchids<br> they'd stolen from a place<br> called the Fakahatchee Strand<br> State Preserve.<br> As natural selection works solely by<br> and for the good of each being,<br> all corporeal and mental<br> endowments will tend to<br> progress towards perfection.<br> It's interesting to contemplate<br> an entangled bank...<br> Polyrrhiza lindenii.<br> A ghost.<br> Cut her down, Russell.<br> Morning.<br> Hey.<br> May I ask you gentlemen what you<br> have in those pillowcases?<br> Yes, sir,<br> you absolutely may.<br> Okay, then, I'm asking.<br> Well, okay, then.<br> Let's see.<br> We've got five kinds<br> of bromeliad,<br> one peperomia,<br> nine orchid varieties.<br> Uh...<br> You know,<br> about 130 plants all told.<br> Which my colleagues here<br> removed from the swamp.<br> You're aware it's illegal<br> to remove plants or animals<br> from state-owned land?<br> Yeah, and don't forget,<br> these plants are<br> all endangered, sir.<br> Every one of them.<br> Well, exactly.<br> That's exactly the issue.<br> This is a state preserve.<br> Yes, sir. It is.<br> But--<br> My colleagues are Seminole Indians.<br> Did I mention that?<br> You're familiar, I'm sure,<br> with the State of Florida<br> v. James E. Billie?<br> So you know even though<br> Seminole Chief Billie<br> killed a Florida panther,<br> one of, what,<br> Forty.<br> Forty.<br> The state couldn't<br> successfully prosecute him,<br> because, you know,<br> he's an Indian, and it's his right.<br> As repugnant as you and I,<br> as white conservationists,<br> find his actions.<br> But--<br> Not to mention the failed attempts<br> on three occasions<br> to prosecute Seminoles<br> for poaching palm fronds.<br> Which I believe they use<br> to thatch the roofs of their<br> traditional chickee huts.<br> How about that?<br> With the chickee huts, right?<br> Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what<br> we use them for. Chickee huts.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, but I don't--<br> I can't let you fellas leave yet.<br> Just hold on there a minute.<br> Okay?<br> Charles, is that you?<br> Did you eat lunch?<br> I had that shrimp cocktail<br> in the fridge. Was it yours?<br> I hope not. I couldn't remember,<br> so I ate it.<br> Maybe we should write<br> our names on our food<br> items from now on.<br> What's with you?<br> My back.<br> Charles, you'll be glad.<br> I have a plan to get me<br> out of your house, pronto.<br> A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?<br> Drum roll, please.<br> I'm gonna be a screenwriter.<br> Like you.<br> I know you think this is one<br> of my "get rich quick" schemes,<br> but I'm doing it right.<br> I'm taking a three-day seminar,<br> and it's only 500 bucks.<br> Screenwriting seminars<br> are bullshit.<br> In theory, I agree with you.<br> But this one's different.<br> This one's highly regarded<br> in the industry.<br> Donald, don't say "industry."<br> I'm sorry. I forgot.<br> Charles, this guy<br> knows screenwriting.<br> People come from all over<br> to study with him.<br> I'll pay you back as soon as I--<br> Let me explain something.<br> Anybody who says<br> he's got "the answer" will<br> attract desperate people,<br> be it in the world of religion--<br> I need to lie down<br> while you explain this.<br> Sorry. I apologize.<br> Okay, go ahead.<br> So--<br> Sorry. Okay. Go.<br> There are no rules, Donald.<br> And anybody who says there are<br> is just, you know--<br> Not rules. Principles.<br> McKee writes that a rule says,<br> "You must do it this way."<br> A principle says, "This works and<br> has through all remembered time."<br> The script I'm starting,<br> it's about flowers.<br> Oh.<br> Nobody's ever done a movie<br> about flowers before.<br> So there are no guidelines.<br> What about Flowers for Algernon?<br> Well, that's not about flowers.<br> And it's not a movie.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I never saw it.<br> How--? Okay, keep going.<br> Look, my point is that<br> those teachers are dangerous<br> if your goal is to do<br> something new.<br> A writer should always<br> have that goal. Writing is<br> a journey into the unknown.<br> It's not building, you know,<br> one of your model airplanes.<br> McKee is a former<br> Fulbright Scholar, Charles.<br> Are you a former<br> Fulbright Scholar?<br> Say something. I dragged her here,<br> and now I'm not saying anything.<br> Make her laugh.<br> Say something funny.<br> I hate parties, Amelia.<br> Why did we come here?<br> Because we're hip, young<br> trendsetters on the make?<br> More like old losers<br> sitting on the floor, maybe.<br> Jesus, Charlie.<br> Heh, heh, heh.<br> Speak for yourself. Okay...<br> Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.<br> We're gonna solve the whole Charlie<br> Kaufman mess for once and for all.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, let me see.<br> What do you need?<br> What, what, what?<br> Well, I'm glad you took<br> the orchid script.<br> I think it will be good for you<br> to get out of your head.<br> It'll ground you to think<br> about the bigger picture,<br> about nature and stuff.<br> I still can't believe<br> they gave me that job.<br> I mean, after that lunch.<br> I was sweating insanely.<br> I was ranting. I was a mess.<br> You were nervous<br> because she was pretty.<br> How do you know<br> she was pretty?<br> After eight months of knowing you,<br> I think I get what makes you sweat.<br> Well, whatever.<br> Well, moving on, what next?<br> You need a new getup.<br> This whole flannel-shirt thing,<br> it's not really doing anything<br> for you anymore.<br> Thanks for coming out<br> with me tonight, Amelia.<br> To begin.<br> To begin.<br> How to start?<br> I'm hungry.<br> I should get coffee.<br> Coffee would help me think.<br> But I should write something first,<br> then reward myself with coffee.<br> Coffee and a muffin. Okay,<br> so I need to establish the themes.<br> Maybe banana-nut.<br> That's a good muffin.<br> Orchid hunting is<br> a mortal occupation.<br> Victorian-era orchid hunter<br> William Arnold<br> drowned on<br> a collecting expedition.<br> Osmers vanished without a trace<br> in Asia.<br> Augustus Margary survived<br> toothache, rheumatism,<br> pleurisy and dysentery,<br> only to be murdered when<br> he completed his mission<br> and traveled beyond Bhamo.<br> Laroche loved orchids, but I...<br> I came to believe he loved<br> the difficulty and fatality<br> of getting them<br> almost as much as he loved<br> the orchids themselves.<br> I've been a professional<br> horticulturist for like 12 years.<br> Uh, I owned my own<br> plant nursery, which was<br> destroyed by the hurricane.<br> I'm a professional<br> plant lecturer.<br> I've given over, like, 60 lectures<br> on the cultivation of plants.<br> I'm a published author,<br> both in magazine and book form.<br> And I have extensive experience<br> with orchids<br> and the asexual micropropagation<br> of orchids under aseptic cultures.<br> That's laboratory work.<br> It's not at all like your nursery work.<br> Um...<br> I'm probably<br> the smartest person I know.<br> Thank you.<br> You're very welcome.<br> Mr. Laroche?<br> I'm Susan Orlean.<br> I'm a writer for The New Yorker.<br> It's a magazine that--<br> I'm familiar with<br> The New Yorker.<br> "The New Yorker?<br> Yes, The New Yorker." Right?<br> That's right.<br> I'm very interested in doing a piece<br> on your situation here, and--<br> Oh, yeah? Yeah.<br> You wanna put this in?<br> I don't care what goes on here.<br> I'm right, and I'll take it all the way<br> to Supreme Court.<br> Because that judge<br> can screw herself.<br> That for real would go in?<br> Absolutely.<br> Hmm.<br> We open on State Road 29.<br> A battered white van speeds along,<br> making a sharp, skidding right<br> into the Fakahatchee Strand<br> State Preserve.<br> The driver of the van is<br> a skinny man with no front teeth.<br> This is John Laroche.<br> I need a break.<br> I loved the Sibelius violin concerto.<br> Yeah, me too. It was great.<br> The end was a little weird, but--<br> Oh, no! God, it was passionate.<br> It was exultant.<br> The soloist was amazing.<br> Such beautiful tones. So precise.<br> God, it blows my mind.<br> I wish I could play like that.<br> You do.<br> Oh, Charlie. I don't.<br> I'm mediocre at best.<br> Well, I love listening to you play.<br> Oh, thanks, Charlie.<br> Here we are.<br> So, uh...<br> What are you up to now, then?<br> Oh, um, I should<br> probably get to bed.<br> I have a lot of work<br> to do tomorrow.<br> Well, good night, then.<br> I would stay out.<br> It's just that I've been struggling<br> on the script right now.<br> Been thinking about it too small,<br> writing it like a story about Laroche.<br> That's not enough. I mean,<br> I wanted to write about flowers.<br> Anyway, I can't figure it out, and I<br> haven't been sleeping well lately,<br> so I thought I should get home<br> and try to get a good night's sleep,<br> you know. Start fresh in the morning.<br> Hm.<br> Otherwise, I'd stay out.<br> I understand. I hope you<br> figure it out, Charlie. I really do.<br> Thanks. Thanks for coming out<br> with me and everything.<br> Sure, it was fun.<br> So I have to go to Santa Barbara<br> next weekend for this orchid show<br> up there.<br> I thought maybe you could come.<br> No, I....<br> I don't think I can make it<br> next weekend.<br> I don't think I can.<br> I've got something. Sorry.<br> Okay.<br> So, well, okay, then.<br> So good night, then.<br> Good night, Charlie.<br> Why didn't I go in?<br> I'm such a chicken.<br> I'm such an idiot. I should have<br> kissed her. I've blown it.<br> I should go and knock<br> on her door right now and kiss her.<br> It would be romantic. Something<br> we could someday tell our kids.<br> I'm gonna do that right now.<br> Hi.<br> Hey.<br> Thanks for picking me up.<br> This van's a piece of shit.<br> But when I hit the jackpot,<br> I'll buy myself an awesome car.<br> Hey, what are you driving?<br> Um, it's-- Well, it's a rental.<br> It's a Lumina.<br> Awesome.<br> I think I'll get one of those too.<br> Here we go.<br> Where do these people<br> learn to drive, huh? Ha, ha!<br> The world's insane.<br> So I was impressed to hear<br> how accomplished you are<br> in horticulture.<br> The thing you gotta know is,<br> my whole life is looking for<br> a goddamn profitable plant, see?<br> And that's the ghost.<br> Why the ghost orchid?<br> Well, the sucker's rare.<br> You know?<br> Mm-hm.<br> And I'm the only one in the world<br> who knows how to cultivate it.<br> Mmm.<br> See, the idea was, get the Indians<br> to pull it from the swamp.<br> I researched it. Long as I don't touch<br> the plant, Florida can't touch us.<br> And I stop future poaching<br> by making the flowers<br> readily available in stores.<br> I'm a hero, the flowers are saved,<br> Laroche and nature win.<br> Oh. Great.<br> Did you get that last part?<br> Uh, yeah, I sure did.<br> Orchids are the sexiest<br> flowers on earth.<br> The name orchid derives from the<br> Latin orchis, which means testicle.<br> Hey, Charles.<br> I pitched my screenplay<br> to Mom.<br> Don't say "pitch."<br> Sorry.<br> Anyway, she said it was<br> Silence of the Lambs<br> meets Psycho.<br> Maybe you guys could collaborate.<br> I hear Mom's good with structure.<br> So how come Amelia doesn't<br> come around anymore?<br> Did you put the moves on her<br> or something?<br> Hi.<br> I'm looking for John Laroche.<br> Hi. Hi.<br> I'm writing an article on John,<br> and I stopped by.<br> Hoped I could see him.<br> John's not here.<br> Oh.<br> Well, you were at the swamp<br> with him, weren't you?<br> Saw you at the courthouse,<br> that's how I know.<br> I'm Matthew Osceola.<br> Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.<br> Maybe I could talk to you<br> for a second.<br> I'm just trying to get a feel<br> for the whole operation...<br> You have very beautiful hair.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you. I just...<br> I just washed it this morning.<br> I just used a new conditioner.<br> I can see your sadness.<br> It's lovely.<br> Well, I'm just tired, that's all.<br> That's my problem.<br> So maybe we could chat<br> a little bit,<br> and I could get some background--<br> I'm not going to talk to you much.<br> It's not personal.<br> It's the Indian way.<br> Angraecum sesquipedale.<br> Beauty! God!<br> Darwin wrote about this one.<br> Charles Darwin?<br> Evolution guy? Hello?<br> You see that nectary down there?<br> Darwin hypothesized a moth<br> with a nose 12 inches long<br> to pollinate it.<br> Everyone thought he was a loon.<br> Then, sure enough,<br> they found this moth<br> with a 12-inch proboscis.<br> "Proboscis" means nose, by the way.<br> I know what it means.<br> Hey, let's not get off the subject.<br> This isn't a pissing contest.<br> The point is,<br> what's so wonderful<br> is that all these flowers<br> have a specific relationship<br> with the insect<br> that pollinates it.<br> There's a certain orchid<br> looks exactly like a certain insect.<br> So the insect is drawn<br> to this flower,<br> its double, its soul mate,<br> and wants nothing more<br> than to make love to it.<br> After the insect flies off,<br> it spots another soul-mate flower<br> and makes love to it, pollinating it.<br> And neither the flower nor the insect<br> will ever understand<br> the significance<br> of their lovemaking.<br> How could they know that because<br> of their little dance, the world lives?<br> But it does.<br> By simply doing<br> what they're designed to do<br> something large<br> and magnificent happens.<br> In this sense, they show us<br> how to live.<br> How the only barometer<br> you have is your heart.<br> How when you spot your flower,<br> you can't let anything get in your way.<br> He's really quite a character.<br> No front teeth.<br> Doesn't seem to bother him at all.<br> Why doesn't he get them fixed?<br> It seems almost sociopathic<br> to make everybody look at that.<br> Yeah, but he gives<br> a great blowjob, honey.<br> He is a fascinating character,<br> though.<br> Sounds like a gold mine,<br> Sue.<br> It could be. I don't know,<br> you know? He's, uh...<br> He lives with his dad,<br> he's obsessed with his<br> dead mother, and...<br> He wears his sunglasses on a little<br> dingle-dangle around his neck.<br> Loving it.<br> Tell them about the van.<br> Okay, the van. The van.<br> I can't tell about the van. I gotta pee.<br> No, tell us about the van.<br> It's amazing. It's...<br> What's in it?<br> You did it in the van.<br> Shut up.<br> David, you tell--<br> Don't you tell them.<br> Don't tell them.<br> Okay, the van.<br> David!<br> This van was filled<br> with junk--<br> Shut up!<br> Potting soil. Shovels.<br> Food wrappers. Fertilizer.<br> Susie said she hoped<br> it was fertilizer, anyway.<br> Said she couldn't be sure.<br> Laroche had a certain<br> aromatic look about him.<br> And she said--<br> She said perhaps his obsessiveness<br> didn't leave room in his schedule<br> for personal hygiene.<br> Maybe the orchids got<br> all the available water.<br> I wanted to want something as much<br> as people wanted these plants.<br> But...<br> it isn't part of my constitution.<br> I suppose I do have<br> one unembarrassed passion.<br> I wanna know what it feels like to care<br> about something passionately.<br> "Should one be lucky enough<br> to see a ghost orchid,<br> all else will seem eclipsed."<br> If the ghost orchid<br> was really a phantom,<br> it was such a bewitching one that<br> it could seduce people to pursue it<br> year after year<br> and mile after miserable mile.<br> If it was a real flower,<br> I wanted to see one.<br> The reason wasn't that<br> I love orchids. I don't even<br> especially like orchids.<br> What I wanted<br> was to see this thing<br> that people were drawn to<br> in such a singular and powerful way.<br> So how many turtles<br> did you end up collecting?<br> Oh, I lost interest right after that.<br> Oh.<br> I dropped turtles when I fell<br> in love with Ice Age fossils.<br> Collected the shit out of them.<br> Fossils were the only thing that made<br> sense to me in this fucked-up world.<br> I ditched fossils<br> for resilvering old mirrors.<br> My mom and I<br> had the largest collection<br> of 19th-century Dutch mirrors<br> on the planet.<br> Perhaps you read about us.<br> Mirror World, October '88?<br> I got a copy here somewhere.<br> I guess I'd just like to know<br> how you can detach from something<br> that you've invested<br> so much of your soul in.<br> I mean, didn't you ever<br> miss turtles?<br> The only thing that made<br> your 10-year-old life worth living?<br> Look, I'll tell you a story, all right?<br> I once fell deeply, you know,<br> profoundly in love with tropical fish.<br> I had 60 goddamn fish tanks<br> in my house.<br> I'd skin-dive to find<br> just the right ones.<br> Anisotremus virginicus,<br> Holacanthus ciliaris,<br> Chaetodon capistratus.<br> You name it.<br> Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."<br> I renounce fish. I vow never<br> to set foot in that ocean again.<br> That's how much "fuck fish."<br> That was 17 years ago, and I have<br> never since stuck a toe in that ocean.<br> And I love the ocean.<br> But why?<br> Done with fish.<br> If you'd really loved something,<br> wouldn't a little bit of it linger?<br> Evidently Laroche's finishes<br> were downright and absolute.<br> He just moved on.<br> I sometimes wished<br> I could do the same.<br> Good afternoon.<br> So, what looks good today?<br> The key lime pie, please.<br> A small slice.<br> And a coffee, please.<br> Skim milk, please.<br> Orchids. I love orchids.<br> Oh, cool. That's... Heh.<br> Well, I'll be right back<br> with your pie.<br> I'm so excited. I've always wanted<br> to come to an orchid show.<br> I think these flowers are so sexy.<br> Let's see what's around back.<br> What?<br> You wanna hear my pitch?<br> Go away, goddamn it.<br> You know, I'm just trying<br> to do something.<br> Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.<br> Cool.<br> Okay, there's this<br> serial killer, right?<br> Well, no, wait.<br> And he's being hunted by a cop.<br> And he's taunting the cop, right?<br> Sending clues who his next victim is.<br> He's already holding her<br> hostage in his basement.<br> So the cop gets obsessed<br> with figuring out her identity<br> and in the process<br> falls in love with her.<br> Even though he's never even<br> met her. She becomes like...<br> Like the unattainable.<br> Like the Holy Grail.<br> It's a little obvious,<br> don't you think?<br> Okay, but here's the twist.<br> We find out that the killer<br> really suffers from<br> multiple personality disorder. Right?<br> See, he's actually really the cop<br> and the girl.<br> All of them are him.<br> Isn't that fucked up?<br> The only idea more overused than<br> serial killers is multiple personality.<br> On top of that,<br> you explore the notion<br> that cop and criminal are<br> two aspects of the same person.<br> See every cop movie ever made<br> for other examples of this.<br> Mom called it<br> psychologically taut.<br> The other thing is, there's no way<br> to write this. Did you consider that?<br> I mean, how could you<br> have somebody held<br> prisoner in a basement<br> and working in a police station<br> at the same time?<br> Trick photography.<br> Okay, that's not what I'm asking.<br> Listen closely.<br> What I'm asking is:<br> In the reality of this movie, where<br> there's only one character, right?<br> Okay?<br> How could you...?<br> What exactly would...?<br> I agree with Mom. Very taut.<br> Sybil meets, I don't know...<br> Dressed to Kill.<br> Cool. I really liked<br> Dressed to Kill.<br> Until the third act denouement.<br> That's not how it's pronounced.<br> Sorry. I--<br> Okay, sorry.<br> Hi.<br> Hey.<br> Some key lime pie for you today?<br> Okay, yeah. That sounds great.<br> I'll cut you an extra-large slice.<br> Preferred customer.<br> Thank you.<br> That's really sweet of you.<br> Well, I'm just a sweetie, ain't I?<br> Still reading about orchids, I hope?<br> Yes, I am.<br> This friend of mine<br> has this little, tiny pink one<br> that grows on a tree branch<br> just like that.<br> I can't remember--<br> It's called an epiphyte.<br> Right. Right!<br> Boy, you know your stuff.<br> No, not really.<br> I'm just learning.<br> Epiphytes grow on trees,<br> but they're not parasites.<br> They get their nourishment<br> from the air and the rain.<br> Well, I'm impressed.<br> That's great.<br> There are more than 30,000 kinds<br> of orchids in the world.<br> Wow, that's a lot, huh?<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll be back with an extra-large slice<br> of key lime pie for my orchid expert.<br> But-- So anyway,<br> I was also wondering...<br> I'm going up to Santa Barbara this<br> Saturday for an orchid show, and I...<br> Oh.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well, um...<br> I apologize. I'm sorry.<br> So I'll just be right back with your pie.<br> There are more than 30,000<br> known orchid species.<br> One looks like a turtle.<br> One looks like a monkey.<br> One looks like an onion.<br> One looks like a schoolteacher.<br> One looks like a gymnast.<br> One looks like that girl<br> in high school with creamy skin.<br> One looks like a New York<br> intellectual<br> with whom you do the Sunday<br> Times crossword puzzle in bed.<br> One looks like a Midwestern<br> beauty queen.<br> One looks like Amelia.<br> One has eyes that dance.<br> One has eyes that contain<br> the sadness of the world.<br> So I got married,<br> and me and my beautiful new wife,<br> my now ex-wife, the bitch,<br> opened up a nursery.<br> People started coming out<br> of the woodwork to ask me stuff<br> and admire my plants<br> and admire me.<br> I think people were spending time<br> with me because they were lonely.<br> Couldn't drag me away<br> And you know why I like plants?<br> Huh-uh.<br> Wild, wild horses<br> Because they're so mutable.<br> Adaptation's a profound process.<br> It means you<br> figure out how to thrive<br> in the world.<br> Yeah, but it's easier for plants.<br> I mean, they have no memory.<br> You know, they just move on to<br> whatever's next. But a person, now...<br> adapting's almost shameful.<br> I mean, it's like<br> running away.<br> No sweeping--<br> Keener!<br> Hey, man.<br> Please don't hit<br> on crew members, Donald.<br> What, the makeup girl?<br> She was hitting on me, bro.<br> Heh, heh, heh.<br> Don't embarrass me.<br> I have to work with these people.<br> I won't. Anyway, listen,<br> I meant to ask you,<br> I need a cool way<br> to kill people.<br> Don't worry. For my script.<br> I don't write that kind of stuff.<br> Come on, man, please?<br> You're the genius.<br> Here you go: The killer's<br> a literature professor.<br> He cuts off little chunks from<br> his victim's bodies until they die.<br> He calls himself<br> "The Deconstructionist."<br> That's kind of good. I like that.<br> See, I was kidding, Donald.<br> Oh, okay. Sorry.<br> You got me. Heh, heh.<br> Do you mind<br> if I use it, though?<br> It's really good.<br> I tried to split the Cassie scene<br> from the beginning to the end.<br> I saw that. Why did you do that?<br> Because I wanted there to be more<br> tension. Then you pick it up later...<br> - But are you changing...?<br> - Keeps more tension.<br> That way the audience<br> gets stuck early on.<br> You like it?<br> I really like it.<br> Oh, it's so funny to be seeing you<br> After so long, girl<br> The way you look...<br> Heh. You look hot tonight, baby.<br> Thanks, Donald.<br> That's swell of you to say.<br> Don't you think she's hot, bro?<br> I'm heading home, Donald.<br> Really? Come on.<br> Hey, it's Amelia.<br> Hey, Amelia!<br> Hey, Donald. Hey, Charlie.<br> Hey. Hi there.<br> Amelia, we don't see you anymore.<br> What happened to you?<br> It's good<br> to see you.<br> Oh! This is my girlfriend,<br> Caroline. She's a makeup artist<br> for the movies.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> This is David, my friend.<br> Hi.<br> Hey. Nice to meet you.<br> Amelia's talked a lot about you.<br> Hi, I'm Donald.<br> Hey.<br> Caroline.<br> Cool camera.<br> So how are you?<br> You know me, a mess.<br> Oh, Charlie,<br> it's really good to see you.<br> Is the work good?<br> It's a disaster.<br> I don't know what I'm doing.<br> But, anyway, it's my problem.<br> I don't want to bore you.<br> You have your stuff, right? I mean,<br> we both have our own separate stuff.<br> Anyway, I should go. I was<br> heading home to do some work.<br> You coming?<br> No, I'm gonna stay at Caroline's.<br> A little push, push<br> in the bush.<br> Donald, you're such a tard!<br> See you, Charlie.<br> To write about a flower,<br> to dramatize a flower,<br> I have to show the flower's arc.<br> And the flower's arc stretches back<br> to the beginning of life.<br> How did this flower get here?<br> What was its journey?<br> Therefore, I should infer<br> from analogy<br> that probably all the organic beings<br> which have ever lived on this earth<br> have descended<br> from some one primordial form<br> into which life was first breathed.<br> It is a journey of evolution.<br> Adaptation.<br> The journey we all take.<br> A journey that unites<br> each and every one of us.<br> Darwin writes that we all come from<br> the very first single-cell organism.<br> Yet here I am.<br> And there's Laroche.<br> There's Orlean.<br> And there's the ghost orchid.<br> All trapped in our own bodies,<br> in moments in history. That's it.<br> That's what I need to do.<br> Tie all of history together.<br> Start right before<br> life begins on the planet.<br> All is...<br> lifeless.<br> And then, like, life begins, um,<br> with organisms.<br> Those single-cell ones.<br> Oh, and it's before sex, because,<br> like, everything was asexual.<br> From there we go to bigger things.<br> Jellyfish.<br> Then that fish that got legs<br> and crawled out on the land.<br> And then we see,<br> you know, like, dinosaurs.<br> Then they're around for a long time.<br> Then an asteroid comes and "phwar!"<br> --the insects, the mammals,<br> the primates, monkeys.<br> The simple monkeys.<br> Old-fashioned monkeys<br> giving way to the new ones.<br> Whatever. And then apes.<br> Whatever. And man.<br> Then we see the history of human<br> hunting, war, love,<br> heartache, disease,<br> loneliness, technology.<br> And we end with Susan Orlean<br> in her office at The New Yorker<br> writing about flowers, and bang!<br> The movie begins.<br> This is the breakthrough I've been<br> hoping for. It's never been done.<br> McKee is a genius!<br> Hilarious. He just comes up<br> with these great jokes,<br> and everybody laughs.<br> But he's serious too, Charles.<br> You'd love him.<br> He's all for originality, just like you.<br> But he says we have to realize<br> that we all write in a genre<br> and we must find our originality<br> within that genre.<br> See, it turns out, there hasn't<br> been a new genre since Fellini<br> invented the mockumentary.<br> My genre's thriller. What's yours?<br> You and I<br> share the same DNA.<br> Is there anything<br> more lonely than that?<br> What'd you say, bro?<br> Yeah?<br> Hey.<br> Hey, Susie-Q.<br> What you up to?<br> I don't wanna bother you.<br> Just thought I'd call<br> and get some more info.<br> I think you say some<br> pretty smart things, John.<br> Yeah, smartest guy I know, huh?<br> So...<br> whatever happened<br> to your nursery?<br> It was going pretty well.<br> But, you know, sometimes bad<br> things happen, darkness descends.<br> Nursery business good,<br> Johnny?<br> Everything's good, Uncle Jim.<br> This last year's been a dream.<br> I'm telling you.<br> Finally pulling out of debt.<br> Amen, honey.<br> I'm so proud of you two, and--<br> No, ma'am. I'm sorry,<br> I can't answer that.<br> Stay right there.<br> Hey.<br> Hold it. Which ones are dead?<br> Sir, please, don't move.<br> Which ones are dead?<br> Let's move it!<br> I killed my mom, you know,<br> and my uncle.<br> Um, that's how I lost<br> my front teeth.<br> And my wife was in a coma<br> for like three weeks.<br> And she divorced me soon after<br> she regained consciousness.<br> Well, I think if I almost died,<br> I would leave my marriage too.<br> Why?<br> Because I could.<br> Because it's like a free pass.<br> Nobody can judge you<br> if you almost died.<br> Well, I judged her.<br> Maybe I was being judged too.<br> It was like a month after that,<br> Hurricane Andrew came and just<br> swooped down<br> like an angel of God...<br> and just wiped out<br> everything I had left.<br> Everything.<br> I knew it'd break my heart<br> to start another nursery,<br> so, you know,<br> when the Seminoles called,<br> wanted a white guy or an expert to<br> get their nursery going, I took the job.<br> I wasn't gonna give them a<br> conventional little potted-plant place.<br> I was gonna give them<br> something<br> amazing, you know?<br> Yeah, I know, John.<br> I know.<br> "I was going to give them<br> something amazing."<br> It's beautifully written.<br> You have such a unique voice.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Ahem.<br> We're big fans.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Laroche is such<br> a fun character.<br> Yeah.<br> It's funny and fresh.<br> And sad in a way.<br> So we were wondering<br> what's next.<br> Well, Random House<br> has asked me<br> to expand it into a book,<br> so I'm gonna be doing that.<br> And--<br> Susan, we would like to option this.<br> You wanna make it into a movie?<br> Into a movie.<br> Ha, ha, ha. Oh, God!<br> That's really...<br> How does that sound?<br> That's very exciting.<br> Good.<br> It's just comical. I hadn't<br> thought of it. I've never<br> written a screenplay before.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> We have screenwriters<br> to write the screenplay.<br> Hey, superstar.<br> It's Marty, super agent.<br> I just wanna remind you<br> it's been 13 weeks<br> and Valerie's anxious<br> to see a draft.<br> If you could wrap things up, get<br> it to her by Monday, that'd be great.<br> Call me when you get this.<br> Adis, amigo.<br> What? What'd you laugh at?<br> You're a genius.<br> Which line?<br> You're a genius.<br> You're a genius.<br> "We see orchid hunter<br> Augustus Margary.<br> He wears a filthy, spittle-soaked rag<br> around his head to quell the pain.<br> The back of his trousers are stained<br> greasy black from an anal leakage<br> due to dysentery.<br> He moans with each tentative step<br> through the overgrown jungle."<br> I'm fucked.<br> We open with Laroche. He's funny.<br> He says, "I love to mutate plants."<br> He says, "Mutation is fun."<br> Okay, we show flowers and... Okay.<br> We have to have the case.<br> Show Laroche.<br> He says, "I was mutated as a baby.<br> It's why I'm so smart."<br> That's funny. Okay, we open<br> at the beginning of time. No!<br> Laroche is driving into the swamp.<br> Crazy White Man!<br> Aah!<br> I don't know how to adapt this.<br> I should've stuck with my own stuff.<br> Don't know why I thought<br> I could write this.<br> See her?<br> I fucked her up the ass.<br> No. I'm kidding.<br> Um...<br> Maybe I can help.<br> It's about flowers.<br> Okay. Um...<br> But it's not only about flowers, right?<br> You have the crazy plant-nut guy?<br> He's funny. Right?<br> "There's not nearly enough of him<br> to fill a book."<br> So Orlean "digresses in long<br> passages." Blah, blah, blah.<br> "No narrative unites these passages."<br> New York Times Book Review.<br> I can't structure this.<br> It's that sprawling New Yorker shit.<br> Oh, man, I'd fuck her up the ass.<br> Sorry.<br> The book has no story.<br> All right. Make one up.<br> I mean, nobody in this town<br> can make up a crazy story like you.<br> You're the king of that.<br> No, I didn't want to do that this time.<br> It's someone else's material.<br> I have a responsibility to Susan--<br> Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer.<br> I wanted to do something simple.<br> Show people how amazing<br> flowers are.<br> Are they amazing?<br> I don't know. I think they are.<br> I need you to get me out of this.<br> All right.<br> Charlie, you've been stringing<br> them along for months.<br> Not to give them anything<br> at this point would be<br> a terrible career move.<br> Hey, my script's going amazing.<br> Right now, I'm working out<br> an image system.<br> Because of my multiple personality<br> theme, I've chosen a motif<br> of broken mirrors to show my<br> protagonist's fragmented self.<br> Bob says an image system<br> increases the complexity<br> of an aesthetic emotion.<br> Bob says--<br> You sound like you're in a cult.<br> No, it's just good<br> writing technique.<br> I made you a copy<br> of McKee's 10 Commandments.<br> I posted one over<br> both our work areas.<br> You shouldn't have done that.<br> Because it's extremely helpful.<br> Hey, Charles, I'm putting a song on.<br> "Happy Together."<br> Like when characters sing<br> in their pajamas and dance around.<br> I thought it'd break the tension.<br> At first I was nervous<br> about putting a song in a thriller,<br> but Bob says that Casablanca,<br> one of the greatest screenplays<br> ever written,<br> did exactly that. Mixed genres.<br> I haven't slept in a week,<br> Donald.<br> I need to go to bed.<br> Oh. Okay.<br> Good night.<br> Yeah?<br> Hi.<br> John, it's Susan again.<br> Hey, Susie-Q.<br> Um...<br> How's it going?<br> Great. I'm training myself<br> on the Internet.<br> It's fascinating.<br> I'm doing pornography.<br> It's amazing how much these suckers<br> will pay for photographs of chicks.<br> It doesn't matter if they're fat<br> or ugly or what.<br> Well, that sounds good.<br> It's great, is what it is.<br> Listen, John, I hate feeling like<br> I'm being a pain to you, but I...<br> I still haven't seen a ghost.<br> Yeah?<br> And I was hoping maybe you'd...<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I'll take you in.<br> Tomorrow.<br> Really?<br> Thank you so much.<br> Oh, John.<br> Damn it.<br> There are too many ideas<br> and things and people.<br> Too many directions to go.<br> I was starting to believe the reason<br> it matters to care about something<br> is that it whittles the world down<br> to a more manageable size.<br> Such sweet, sad insights.<br> So true.<br> I like looking at you.<br> I like looking at you too, Charlie.<br> I don't know how to do this.<br> I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.<br> You've written a beautiful book.<br> I can't sleep.<br> I'm losing my hair.<br> I'm fat and repulsive.<br> Shh. You're not. You're not.<br> Just whittle it down, you know?<br> Focus on one thing in the story.<br> Find that one thing<br> that you care passionately about<br> and then write about that.<br> We see Susan Orlean:<br> delicate, haunted by loneliness,<br> fragile, beautiful.<br> She lies awake next to her sleeping,<br> insensitive husband.<br> Her voice-over begins,<br> "I suppose I do have one<br> unembarrassed passion.<br> I want to know how it feels to care<br> about something passionately."<br> Hey.<br> Morning.<br> Hey, you two.<br> Up early for a change?<br> You seem chipper.<br> I'm good. I have some new ideas.<br> God, you guys are so smart.<br> It's like a brain factory in here.<br> I got some ideas too this morning.<br> He got really, really good ones.<br> You know,<br> in a Donald sort of way.<br> I'm putting--<br> Hey! What?<br> I'm putting in a chase sequence.<br> So the killer flees on horseback<br> with the girl.<br> Cop's after them on a motorcycle.<br> And it's like a battle between<br> motors and horses.<br> Like technology versus horse.<br> And they're still<br> all one person, right?<br> Well, that's the big payoff.<br> It sounds exciting.<br> Thanks, man.<br> Thanks.<br> See, I told you he was gonna like it.<br> - You're my muse. You are.<br> - I love being your muse.<br> I'm so happy about that.<br> I'm picking up<br> an order for Kaufman.<br> Oh.<br> Valerie.<br> Hi, Charlie.<br> It's quite a coincidence<br> bumping into you.<br> I'm sorry I didn't call you back.<br> I was away last week.<br> That's okay.<br> I meant to because<br> things are going well,<br> and I wanted you to know.<br> That's great.<br> I'm anxious to see something.<br> You should sit because<br> I'm here with Susan right now.<br> She's dying to meet you,<br> so it's funny bumping into you.<br> Have a seat.<br> Susan Orlean's here?<br> Yeah, she's here in town<br> for a reading or something.<br> She's just on the phone.<br> Sit down. Have a seat.<br> She's dying to meet you.<br> Oh, um, um-- Well, I should<br> probably go, because...<br> Well, I'd love to meet her too,<br> but I don't want to be beholden.<br> And, well--<br> Once you meet somebody<br> that you've been writing about,<br> it becomes very hard<br> to separate. So...<br> Well, okay, I'll speak to you soon.<br> And I'm almost done.<br> I'm almost done.<br> Tell Susan that I would love<br> to meet with her at a future date.<br> As she sees fit.<br> Okay.<br> Who am I kidding?<br> This isn't Susan Orlean's story.<br> I have no connection with her.<br> I can't even meet her.<br> I have no understanding of anything<br> but my own panic, self-loathing<br> and pathetic, little existence.<br> The only thing I'm qualified to write<br> about is myself and my own self--<br> We open on Charlie Kaufman.<br> Fat, old, bald, repulsive,<br> sitting in a Hollywood restaurant<br> across from Valerie Thomas,<br> a lovely, statuesque film executive.<br> Kaufman, trying to get<br> a writing assignment,<br> wanting to impress her,<br> sweats profusely.<br> Fat, bald Kaufman<br> paces furiously in his bedroom.<br> He speaks into his hand-held<br> tape recorder, and he says,<br> "Charlie Kaufman, fat, bald,<br> repulsive, old,<br> sits at a Hollywood restaurant<br> with Valerie Thomas."<br> Kaufman, repugnant, ridiculous,<br> jerks off to the book jacket photo<br> of Susan Or--<br> What do you want?<br> I've finished my script.<br> I'm done.<br> So would you show it<br> to your agent?<br> It's called The Three.<br> Thanks. I also want to<br> thank you for your idea.<br> It was very helpful.<br> I changed it a little.<br> Now the killer cuts off body pieces<br> and makes his victims eat them.<br> Caroline has this tattoo of a snake<br> swallowing its own tail, and--<br> Ouroboros.<br> I don't know what that means.<br> The snake.<br> It's called Ouroboros.<br> Don't think so. It's cool for my killer<br> to have this modus operandi.<br> When he forces the woman<br> who's him to eat herself<br> he's eating himself to death.<br> I'm insane.<br> I'm Ouroboros.<br> I don't know what that word means.<br> I've written myself<br> into my screenplay.<br> That's kind of weird, huh?<br> It's self-indulgent.<br> It's narcissistic.<br> It's solipsistic.<br> It's pathetic.<br> I'm pathetic.<br> I'm fat and pathetic.<br> I'm sure you had good reasons,<br> Charles. You're an artist.<br> It's because I'm too timid to speak<br> to the woman who wrote the book.<br> Because I'm pathetic.<br> Because I have no idea how to write.<br> I can't make flowers fascinating.<br> Because I suck.<br> Hey, am I in the script?<br> I'm going to New York.<br> I'll meet her. That's it.<br> That's what I have to do.<br> Don't get mad at me<br> for saying,<br> but Bob's having a seminar<br> in New York this weekend.<br> So if you're stuck...<br> And she said, "Laroche<br> is such a fun character."<br> No shit, I'm a fun character.<br> Who's gonna play me?<br> Well, I've gotta write<br> the book first, John.<br> Then, you know, they get<br> somebody to write the screenplay.<br> Hey, I think I should play me.<br> Ha, ha, ha.<br> Most people yearn for something<br> exceptional, something so inspiring<br> they'd want to risk everything for<br> that passion, but few would act on it.<br> It was very powerful,<br> and it's intoxicating to be<br> around someone so alive.<br> Come on, just follow me.<br> They're right nearby.<br> Okay.<br> Can I ask you<br> a personal question?<br> Look, we're not lost.<br> I've done this a million times.<br> When everything is killing me,<br> I just say, "Screw it,"<br> and go straight ahead.<br> Oh, fuck...<br> Sundial.<br> I'll just set this up,<br> we'll wait a few minutes,<br> and then we'll be able to tell<br> which way the sun's moving.<br> We should be headed southeast.<br> So you collect anything?<br> Not really, no.<br> Yeah, well, you know,<br> it's not really about<br> collecting the thing.<br> It's about being able...<br> The thing about computers,<br> the thing I like,<br> is that I'm immersed in them,<br> but it's not like a living thing that's<br> gonna leave or die or something.<br> John, I'm sorry. I just--<br> Okay.<br> I don't--<br> Hey. Okay.<br> Fuck the sundial.<br> I know how to get out of here.<br> I know how to get out of here.<br> I know this swamp like<br> the back of my goddamn hand.<br> You're just like everybody else.<br> Fucking leeches.<br> You just attach yourself to me<br> and suck me dry, spit me out.<br> Why don't you get your own life?<br> Your own fucking interests?<br> Fucking spoiled bitch.<br> Life seemed to be filled with things<br> that were just like the ghost orchid.<br> Wonderful to imagine<br> and easy to fall in love with,<br> but a little fantastic<br> and fleeting<br> and out of reach.<br> "--but a little fantastic<br> and fleeting and out of reach."<br> Hello?<br> Hey, it's Marty. How's it going?<br> Has it been helpful talking<br> to the writer? What's her name?<br> Susan Orlean. It's been okay.<br> Uh-huh. Well, I mean,<br> are you making headway?<br> Valerie's breathing down my neck.<br> You can't rush inspiration.<br> Okay. All right. Fair enough.<br> Listen, the other reason<br> I called was The Three.<br> It's just amazing.<br> I don't know what that is.<br> Donald's script.<br> A smart, edgy thriller.<br> It's the best script I've read all year.<br> Oh.<br> Good.<br> Yeah, I'm gonna sell it for a shitload.<br> Two fucking talented guys<br> in one family.<br> Maybe you could get your brother<br> to help you with the orchid thing.<br> Marty, don't say that. I mean--<br> All right. It's just a thought, buddy.<br> I mean, he's really<br> goddamn amazing at structure.<br> I have to go.<br> All right. Adis, amigo.<br> Finish that--<br> Fuck!<br> Okay, thank you, thank you.<br> We have a long three days ahead.<br> Years from now, you'll be at a posh<br> cocktail party congratulating yourself<br> on how you spent<br> a weekend with an asshole<br> from Hollywood for your art.<br> I am pathetic. I am a loser.<br> So, what is the substance<br> of writing?<br> I have failed. I am panicked.<br> I have sold out. I am worthless.<br> I-- What the fuck am I doing here?<br> What the fuck<br> am I doing here? Fuck!<br> It is my weakness, my ultimate lack<br> of conviction that brings me here.<br> Easy answers,<br> rules to shortcut yourself to success.<br> And here I am because my jaunt<br> into the abyss brought me nothing.<br> Well, isn't that the risk one takes<br> for attempting something new?<br> I should leave right now.<br> I'll start over. I need to face<br> this project head-on--<br> And God help you if you use<br> voice-over in your work, my friends.<br> God help you.<br> It's flaccid, sloppy writing.<br> Any idiot can write narration to<br> explain the thoughts of the character.<br> Okay, that's it.<br> One hour for lunch.<br> You cannot have a protagonist<br> without desire.<br> It doesn't make any sense.<br> Any fucking sense.<br> You follow? Good.<br> Anyone else?<br> Yes?<br> What if a writer is attempting<br> to create a story where nothing<br> much happens?<br> Where people don't change,<br> they don't have any epiphanies.<br> They struggle and are frustrated,<br> and nothing is resolved.<br> More a reflection<br> of the real world.<br> The real world?<br> Yes, sir.<br> The real fucking world.<br> First of all, you write a screenplay<br> without conflict or crisis,<br> you'll bore your audience to tears.<br> Secondly, nothing happens<br> in the world?<br> Are you out of your fucking mind?<br> People are murdered every day.<br> There's genocide, war, corruption.<br> Every fucking day,<br> somewhere in the world,<br> somebody sacrifices his life<br> to save somebody.<br> Every day, someone somewhere<br> takes a conscious decision<br> to destroy someone else.<br> People find love.<br> People lose it.<br> A child watches a mother beaten<br> to death on the steps of a church.<br> Someone goes hungry.<br> Somebody else betrays<br> his best friend for a woman.<br> If you can't find that stuff in life,<br> then you, my friend,<br> don't know crap about life!<br> And why the fuck are you wasting my<br> two precious hours with your movie?<br> I don't have any use for it!<br> I don't have any<br> bloody use for it!<br> Okay, thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> No. Thank you.<br> Thank you so much, Mr. McKee.<br> This course makes you look at<br> writing in a whole different way.<br> Mr. McKee.<br> Yes?<br> I'm the guy you yelled at<br> this morning.<br> I need more.<br> I'm the one who thought<br> things didn't happen in life.<br> Ah. Right. Okay.<br> Nice to see you.<br> I need to talk.<br> Mr. McKee, my even<br> standing here is very scary.<br> I don't meet people well.<br> But what you said this morning<br> shook me to the bone.<br> It was bigger than<br> my screenwriting choices.<br> It was about my choices<br> as a human being. Please.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, you know, I could<br> sure use a drink, my friend.<br> "--but a little fantastic<br> and fleeting and out of reach."<br> Then what happens?<br> Well, that's the end<br> of the book.<br> I wanted to present it simply<br> without big character arcs<br> or sensationalizing the story.<br> I wanted to show flowers<br> as God's miracles.<br> I wanted to show<br> that Orlean never saw<br> the blooming ghost orchid.<br> It was about disappointment.<br> I see.<br> That's not a movie.<br> You gotta go back,<br> put in the drama.<br> I can't go back. I've got pages of<br> false starts and wrong approaches.<br> I'm way past my deadline.<br> I'll tell you a secret.<br> A last act makes a film.<br> Wow them in the end,<br> and you got a hit.<br> You can have flaws, problems,<br> but wow them in the end<br> and you've got a hit.<br> Find an ending. But don't cheat.<br> And don't you dare bring in<br> a deus ex machina.<br> Your characters must change<br> and the change<br> must come from them.<br> Do that and you'll be fine.<br> You promise?<br> Mr. McKee.<br> Have you taken my course before?<br> My brother did.<br> My twin brother, Donald.<br> He's the one who got me to come.<br> Twin screenwriters?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, Julius and Philip Epstein,<br> who wrote Casablanca,<br> they were twins<br> You mentioned that in class.<br> Finest screenplay ever written.<br> Great writers' residence.<br> Donald.<br> Hey, how's your trip going?<br> You getting it on with that<br> lady journalist, you dog, you?<br> Yeah.<br> Listen, I'm just calling to say<br> congratulations on your script.<br> Isn't that cool? Marty says he can<br> get me high-sixes against a mil-five.<br> That's great, Donald.<br> I want to thank you<br> for all your help.<br> I wasn't any help.<br> Come on,<br> you let me stay in your place.<br> And your integrity<br> inspired me to even try.<br> It's been a wild ride.<br> Catherine says<br> she wants to play Cassie.<br> Oh, please!<br> Ha, ha, ha.<br> Please, Donald?<br> Catherine Keener?<br> Catherine Keener's in my house?<br> Yeah, we're playing Boggle.<br> She's great. You should really<br> hang out with her, Charles.<br> Yeah. Um, look...<br> I've been thinking.<br> Maybe you'd be interested<br> in hanging out for a few days<br> in New York.<br> Oh, my God, yes.<br> Yeah?<br> I was gonna show my script<br> to some people,<br> and, well, maybe you could<br> read it too, you know, if you like.<br> Of course. I'd be flattered.<br> Okay.<br> Thanks, Charles.<br> Okay, bye.<br> So, like, what would you do?<br> The script kind of<br> makes fun of me, huh?<br> I'm sorry. I was trying something--<br> Hey, I don't mind. It's funny.<br> Good. Okay.<br> So, what would you do?<br> You and me are so different,<br> Charles. We're different talents.<br> I know. Just for fun...<br> how would the great Donald<br> end this script?<br> Heh, heh. Shut up.<br> "The great Donald."<br> I feel like you're missing something.<br> All right. Like what?<br> Look.<br> I did a little research<br> on the airplane.<br> "Sometimes this kind of story<br> turns out to be something more,<br> some glimpse of life<br> that expands<br> like those Japanese paper balls<br> you drop in water<br> and they bloom into flowers<br> and the flower is so marvelous<br> you can't believe there was<br> a time all you saw<br> was a paper ball<br> and a glass of water."<br> First of all, that's inconsistent.<br> She said she didn't care<br> about flowers.<br> For God's sake, it's just a metaphor.<br> Well, but for what?<br> What turned that paper ball<br> into a flower?<br> It's not in the book, Charles.<br> I don't know. You're reaching.<br> Maybe.<br> But I think you actually need<br> to speak to this woman.<br> To know her.<br> I can't.<br> Really.<br> I'll go.<br> I'll pretend I'm you.<br> I want to do it, Charles.<br> We'll get to the bottom of this.<br> We're gonna fix your movie, bro.<br> But you've gotta be<br> exactly me.<br> I have a reputation<br> to maintain.<br> You can't be a goofball.<br> Can't be an asshole.<br> I'm not an asshole.<br> You know what I mean.<br> No flirting.<br> No bad jokes.<br> Don't laugh<br> how you laugh.<br> I'm not gonna laugh.<br> I get to have people<br> think I'm you.<br> It's an honor.<br> So I guess I'll bring out<br> the big guns now.<br> Do you keep in touch<br> with Laroche?<br> I felt I detected an attraction to him<br> in the subtext. Care to comment?<br> Uh...<br> Well, our relationship<br> was strictly reporter-subject.<br> I mean, certainly an intimacy does<br> evolve in this kind of relationship.<br> By definition, I was so interested<br> in everything he had to say.<br> But the relationship ends<br> when the book ends.<br> Mendacious deceit.<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> I just have one more question.<br> If you could have dinner with one<br> historical personage, living or dead,<br> who would it be?<br> Uh, well, I would have to say...<br> Einstein.<br> Or Jesus.<br> Very good.<br> Interesting answer.<br> She's lying.<br> What do you mean?<br> What happened?<br> Nothing. She said everything right.<br> Too right.<br> Well, maybe because they're true.<br> Did you embarrass me?<br> People who answer questions<br> too right are liars.<br> Everybody says Jesus and Einstein.<br> That's a prepackaged answer.<br> "Jesus and Einstein"?<br> Listen, Charles, I have an idea.<br> You'll need to buy me<br> a pair of binoculars.<br> What's<br> "Jesus and Einstein"?<br> Imagine me and you<br> I do<br> Come on.<br> I think about you day and night<br> It's only right<br> Sing with me.<br> To think about the one you love<br> And hold her tight<br> So happy together<br> What the hell do you need<br> binoculars for?<br> Let's go, let's go.<br> She hung up the phone.<br> She's upset.<br> Stop watching her.<br> Leave her alone.<br> She's crying.<br> She's at her computer.<br> This is morally reprehensible.<br> United<br> to Miami.<br> Eleven fifty-five a.m.<br> tomorrow.<br> Thought she was done with Laroche.<br> Her parents live in Florida.<br> That was no parent phone call,<br> my friend.<br> Don't say "my friend."<br> A guy entering.<br> Handsome.<br> Must be her husband.<br> She's acting weird<br> with him, though, right?<br> Don't you think?<br> What's she hiding<br> from him?<br> Maybe she's a lesbian<br> and doesn't know how to tell him.<br> What do you think?<br> Have you checked out<br> Laroche's porn site?<br> No. I'm trying to read.<br> Anyway, I'm gonna look<br> at the porn site. Research.<br> Don't tell my old lady.<br> You mean Mom?<br> No, I don't mean Mom.<br> Still say we should go<br> to Miami tomorrow.<br> Forget it.<br> Some of these chicks<br> look okay.<br> Hey, guess what.<br> We're going to Miami tomorrow.<br> I said, no.<br> I said, oh, yeah, baby. Come here.<br> What I came to understand<br> is that change is not a choice.<br> Not for a species of plant,<br> and not for me.<br> It happens, and you are different.<br> Maybe the only distinction<br> between the plant and me<br> is that afterward,<br> I lied about my change.<br> I lied in my book.<br> I pretended with my husband<br> that everything was the same.<br> But something happened<br> in the swamp that day.<br> Hey, look.<br> I told you I'd find<br> the jewel of the Fakahatchee.<br> It's a flower.<br> Just a flower.<br> Well, might as well grab it.<br> Long as I'm here.<br> Oh, man.<br> Boy, my porn site's<br> gonna be big.<br> Look, something<br> I didn't tell you<br> that I want to tell you<br> about the ghost. Okay?<br> I think it might help you.<br> I'd just started at the nursery.<br> And I went back one night<br> to pick up something.<br> They wanted the ghost<br> just to extract the drug.<br> It had been a ceremonial thing,<br> but the young guys, you know,<br> they liked to get stoned.<br> So Matthew...?<br> He was one of the guys who--?<br> Sure.<br> Matthew lived on that shit<br> till they ran out.<br> Because there was this one day<br> he was fascinated by me.<br> By my hair and my sadness.<br> Yeah, well, it does that.<br> That's what I wanted to tell you.<br> I mean, I think you'd like it,<br> Susie. It seems to help<br> people be fascinated.<br> I can extract it for you.<br> I know how. I watched.<br> I'm probably the only<br> white guy who knows.<br> I want to do this, Susie.<br> I'm done with orchids, Laroche.<br> Hello?<br> Hi.<br> It's John.<br> Did you get my package?<br> John?<br> John!<br> Johnny.<br> Hey, John?<br> Yeah?<br> Very happy now.<br> Well, I'm glad.<br> Very happy.<br> Um, John?<br> Hm?<br> Will you go like this--?<br> No. Keep going.<br> No. No.<br> I'm trying to make a dial tone.<br> And you have to sustain.<br> And then I will join you,<br> and together--<br> See, I can't do it by myself.<br> Which one do you want me to do?<br> Yes. Yes. Yes.<br> Okay. Here we go.<br> That's it.<br> We got it.<br> We got it. That's fucking amazing.<br> Do you ever get<br> lonely sometimes, Johnny?<br> Well, I was a weird kid.<br> Nobody liked me.<br> But I had this idea...<br> if I waited long enough,<br> someone would<br> come around and just,<br> you know, understand me.<br> Like my mom.<br> Except someone else.<br> She'd look at me and quietly say,<br> "Yes."<br> Just like that.<br> And I wouldn't be alone anymore.<br> Oh, I wish I were an ant.<br> Oh, they're so shiny.<br> You're shinier than any ant,<br> darling.<br> That's the sweetest thing<br> anybody has ever said to me.<br> Well,<br> I like you, that's why.<br> Hey.<br> I don't have time for that.<br> I'll get a closer look. You wait here.<br> No, wait.<br> I should go.<br> I mean, it should be me, right?<br> I mean, it's my...<br> I was, you know--<br> Go for it.<br> You're the man.<br> Rip them.<br> Just rip them.<br> Darling, I don't know<br> what's come over you.<br> You came all over me last time<br> I was here, as I recall.<br> Oh!<br> Mmm!<br> Ooh.<br> Goddamn!<br> Hey! Fuck. Hey! Hey!<br> Aah! Aah!<br> Get in here!<br> Shut the fuck up, now!<br> Sit the fuck down!<br> Who is that, Johnny?<br> Who the fuck are you?<br> I just-- Nobody.<br> Huh?<br> I just-- I'm just--<br> Wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> He's that screenwriter.<br> The guy that's adapting our book?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, that's wild.<br> It's nice to meet you.<br> Hey, dude,<br> who's gonna play me?<br> I don't know that. I should--<br> Well, I thought<br> I should play me.<br> Why--? Did he follow me?<br> No, of course not. I should go.<br> Yeah, yeah. I mean,<br> it was nice to meet you,<br> but let me give you<br> my number.<br> I'm really freaking here, Johnny.<br> Why is he here?<br> Why did he follow me?<br> What does he know?<br> I don't know anything about anything.<br> He did see the greenhouse.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Are you gonna write about this<br> in your screenplay?<br> I really don't know what "this" is.<br> He's lying.<br> Hold him.<br> Stay! Just--<br> We have to kill him.<br> What?<br> What are we supposed to do?<br> What can we do?<br> Sit the fuck down!<br> Susie, you gotta<br> calm down.<br> Now, you're getting<br> a little emotional.<br> You don't know--<br> I can't have him writing about me.<br> I can't have the whole world,<br> all the people knowing about us<br> and about this.<br> Why?<br> You ashamed of me, Susie?<br> No, that's not it.<br> No. How can you even think of that?<br> Well--<br> I'm a professional journalist,<br> and the drugs and--<br> Susie.<br> We can't kill anyone.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Then I'll do it.<br> By myself.<br> Susan--<br> Hey! Come on. Fucking get down!<br> - I wouldn't tell any--<br> - Put him in his fucking car!<br> Turn it off. Just get out.<br> Run! Run! Go!<br> Susan! What the fuck was that?<br> I don't know. I couldn't see.<br> Shit.<br> Fuck!<br> Come on!<br> Help me find the flashlight.<br> So it was a guy?<br> Yeah. Fat.<br> That's all I could tell.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> We're gonna have to split up.<br> I can't. I can't be by myself out here.<br> I'm not gonna do that.<br> They're gonna find us.<br> I don't think so.<br> I don't want to die, Donald.<br> I've wasted my life.<br> God, I've wasted it.<br> You didn't. And you're not gonna die.<br> I wasted it.<br> I admire you, Donald, you know?<br> I spent my whole life paralyzed,<br> worrying about what people think,<br> and you, you're just oblivious.<br> I'm not oblivious.<br> No, you don't understand.<br> I mean that as a compliment.<br> There was this time in high school.<br> I was watching you out<br> the library window,<br> you were talking to Sarah Marsh.<br> Oh, God, I was so in love with her.<br> I know. And you were flirting<br> with her, and she was being<br> really sweet to you.<br> I remember that.<br> And then, when you walked away,<br> she started making fun of you<br> with Kim Canetti.<br> And it was like<br> they were laughing at me.<br> You didn't know at all?<br> You seemed so happy.<br> I knew. I heard them.<br> Well, how come<br> you were so happy?<br> I loved Sarah, Charles.<br> It was mine, that love.<br> I owned it.<br> Even Sarah didn't have<br> the right to take it away.<br> I can love whoever I want.<br> But she thought you were pathetic.<br> That was her business,<br> not mine.<br> You are what you love,<br> not what loves you.<br> That's what I decided<br> a long time ago.<br> What's up?<br> Thank you.<br> For what?<br> No, shh, shh, shh!<br> Listen. I hear them.<br> I hear them. I hear them breathing.<br> Charlie?<br> Charlie?<br> Charlie!<br> - Guys?<br> - Charlie!<br> Charlie!<br> Where's the van?<br> Are they gone?<br> I don't know. Maybe.<br> John? John!<br> Shit!<br> I can't believe I got shot.<br> Isn't that fucked up? Heh, heh.<br> Shut up. Stop laughing.<br> Donald? You're gonna be okay.<br> It's gonna be okay, Donald.<br> Just don't go to sleep. Just don't<br> go to sleep, Donald. Look at me.<br> Look at me, Donald.<br> Keep looking at me.<br> Open your eyes.<br> Donald, please open your eyes.<br> Donald. Donald, please<br> open your eyes, Donald.<br> Donald! Donald, open your eyes!<br> Imagine me and you<br> I do<br> I think about you day and night<br> It's only right<br> To think about the one you love<br> And hold you tight<br> So happy together<br> Look at me.<br> Imagine me and you<br> I do<br> And I--<br> Help!<br> John!<br> Halt!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Now I have to do this too.<br> I'm not a killer.<br> You put yourself in--<br> Johnny!<br> - Susan!<br> - No!<br> Help!<br> No, no!<br> Johnny! Johnny! John!<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, you fat piece of shit!<br> He's dead, you loser!<br> Shut up!<br> You ruined my life, you fat fuck!<br> Shut up! Shut up!<br> Fuck you, lady! You're just a lonely,<br> old, desperate, pathetic drug addict!<br> Oh, my God.<br> It's over.
