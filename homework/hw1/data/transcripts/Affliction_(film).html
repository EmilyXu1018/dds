They're still out.<br> - Those are the Hoyts.<br> - I don't care. They're out!<br> Can't you see?

[Continues, Indistinct]<br> [Man] I'll tell you who's a pisser.<br> Glen Whitehouse.<br> He was mean normal.<br> But when he drank,<br> it was like he burst on fire.<br> Brown's Canadian.<br> Always drank B.C.<br> One Christmas, there was this cord<br> of wood out back he'd forgotten about.<br> He decides he's gonna have<br> his boys stack it.<br> Except it's been out back<br> for two months. The wood's all iced in.<br> He grabs the boys, throws them outside.<br> And he's drunk.<br> Oh! Come on, move it.<br> Daylight in the swamp.<br> - Pop, the kids are waiting for us.<br> - Rolfe.<br> A lesson in work<br> and its rewards.<br> You'll thank me for this one day, boys.<br> Now, come on.<br> Here we are, boys. Dig in.<br> Come on, let's do it right over here.<br> See that?<br> Goddamn it!<br> Let's do it!<br> Show a little muscle there.<br> Come on.<br> [Laughing]<br> There! There we go.<br> Attaboy. Come on!<br> Please, Pop, let's go back.<br> What the hell are you,<br> a quitter?<br> Huh? Get in there!<br> Quitter? Huh? Huh?<br> - So what happened?<br> - Oh, beats me.<br> That's all I heard.<br> Wade would know more about it. Wade?<br> We were just talkin' about your old man.<br> "What are you, a quitter?"<br> [Men Laughing]<br> Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better<br> to do than tell stories?<br> The pity is, someday<br> some college student will come in here<br> and believe this shit...<br> 'cause you're the only one<br> dumb enough to talk to him.<br> [Pop Grunts, Door Opens]<br> That was some job.<br> We'll work at it, we promise.<br> - I think I made a point.<br> - You just need a drink.<br> What was that, Wade?<br> You say something?<br> You got something to say, say it.<br> Say it!<br> You no good pup!<br> Mom!<br> - Well?<br> - Mom!<br> Mom!<br> [Mockingly]<br> Mom! Mom!<br> [Woman's Voice]<br> # I've forgotten more #<br> # Than you'll ever know #<br> # About him ##<br> [Wade]<br> Don't look right.<br> The sign.<br> Looks like it's spelled wrong<br> or somethin'.<br> Ahh. Wade, Wade. It's people like you<br> who keep this town from prospering.<br> I'm not finding fault. It's good<br> for you. It's good for the town.<br> - It's a good idea.<br> - Yeah.<br> What did you do? Hire one of<br> those hippie craftsman from Concord?<br> Think you're gettin'<br> something you can use,<br> only it turns out to be<br> a work of art?<br> Whatever somebody does to improve things<br> around here, you gotta find fault.<br> - Is that it?<br> - Come on.<br> I'm only sayin' there's something wrong<br> with "Homemade Cooking."<br> The sign's fine.<br> What it says is wrong.<br> Who needs it? Everybody that<br> comes here, been coming here for years.<br> What do we need<br> a sign for?<br> But I guess it's better<br> than what was there before.<br> - What was there before?<br> - [Laughing] Nothin'.<br> There was nothin' here before.<br> Hmm.<br> - You okay?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> I'm sorry about what I said.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - About you and Jill<br> and needing a third person.<br> - She went back with Lillian?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah. Forget it.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'm gonna start me<br> one of those custody suits.<br> - I don't give a fucking shit anymore!<br> - You don't mean that.<br> - Yeah, I do.<br> - No, you don't. You're just pissed.<br> You just oughta cool off for a few days,<br> then have a long talk with Lillian.<br> Work it out with her.<br> Tell her how you feel.<br> - Lillian's not out to get you.<br> - The hell she isn't!<br> Lillian's been trying to nail me<br> to a cross since the day I met her.<br> I'm gonna get me a lawyer from Concord,<br> and get this divorce thing rearranged.<br> - Marge?<br> - That goddamn woman.<br> She thinks she can cart Jill off<br> and leave me alone like this.<br> I'm a whole lot more than pissed.<br> I've been there plenty in my life,<br> and I know the difference.<br> And this is different.<br> Marge, you got orders.<br> Call me.<br> - Tonight. Let's get together tonight.<br> - Okay.<br> - Talked to Jack?<br> - Nah. Not since last night.<br> He took a guy hunting.<br> The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang!<br> That's what it sounded like.<br> Not on purpose.<br> I assume accidental.<br> - Who? Jack?<br> - The other guy.<br> - How'd you hear this?<br> - C.B., a little while ago.<br> One of the boys comin' in. Jack on<br> the C.B. Callin' for state troopers.<br> I figured you'd know<br> what really happened.<br> I was on the grader. Twombley,<br> summer people from Massachusetts.<br> Friend of Gordon's. It was Gordon's idea<br> for Jack to take him hunting.<br> Oh, boy. I gotta go.<br> I want you to work on<br> a new logo for that. I don't like that.<br> - All righty.<br> - Put an idea of a mountain down there.<br> Something like that<br> with a stream below.<br> - What's the hurry?<br> - Hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.<br> - I figured you would've heard.<br> - Twombley! Jesus! Get moving.<br> I gotta get up there. How would I have<br> heard? Have somebody move the grader.<br> Go on. Go on! You drive.<br> We'll take my truck.<br> [C.B. Indistinct]<br> [LaRiviere]<br> Turn it off.<br> All you heard was there was<br> some kind of accident?<br> Twombley's shot. I heard that.<br> Jack's okay, I assume.<br> - You don't know how bad or anything?<br> - You mean Twombley?<br> Yes, Wade.<br> I mean Twombley.<br> Put out that cigarette!<br> Fuck, fuck, fuck!<br> [Wade] Probably shot himself<br> in the foot or somethin'.<br> That's what usually happens.<br> - I should've sent you instead of Jack.<br> - I wish you had.<br> I'd rather be deer huntin' than freezin'<br> my ass off on that fuckin' grader.<br> Well, you ain't the hunter Jack is, and<br> he can't drive the grader worth shit.<br> - Like hell!<br> - [Siren Wailing]<br> - That must've been Twombley.<br> - Want me to follow them to Littleton?<br> No, no, let's go to the top.<br> Talk to Jack first.<br> He'll know what happened.<br> He best fucking better know!<br> There's Jack.<br> [Policeman]<br> I clocked 105.<br> [Jack]<br> [Policeman] Turns out to be<br> one of these kids up for the weekend.<br> She says, "Officer, can we make this<br> disappear?" Shows me $100 bill.<br> Heard the news?<br> - I heard Twombley got shot.<br> - Yeah.<br> Watch the dog, Wade.<br> - Takes a mind to,<br> he'll take your head off.<br> - He likes me.<br> - Is it bad?<br> - 30-30 at close range.<br> Jesus!<br> - Will he make it?<br> - D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open.<br> Had a hole in his back<br> you could put your fist into.<br> Nice hole in front too.<br> - Did you see it?<br> - No. Heard it.<br> We weren't far apart.<br> I'd spotted this buck.<br> I looked at the bottom<br> of the cliff where he was standin',<br> and there the fucker was,<br> deader than shit!<br> I called it right in.<br> This is gonna be one mess<br> to clean up.<br> Twombley's son-in-law and daughter<br> are up for the weekend.<br> - Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?<br> - Yeah. Damn near ran me over.<br> You want to tell them?<br> You knew the old man.<br> What the fuck!<br> My day's already ruined.<br> Gimme the keys.<br> You can go back with Jack.<br> - You still got plowing to do.<br> - It ain't finished,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> - Something bugging you?<br> - Yeah, a few things.<br> Right now we're not interested<br> in a few things.<br> Why don't you do a few things<br> for me, and then you get bugged<br> on your own time?<br> You might as well take the rest<br> of the day off. You look fucked up.<br> You've been paid<br> for the day anyhow, right?<br> Not exactly.<br> I mean, he never paid me.<br> Don't worry.<br> You'll get your money.<br> Don't talk to any newspaper<br> about this.<br> [LaRiviere] Twombley's<br> a big deal down in Massachusetts.<br> Just tell them that your lawyer<br> says you shouldn't comment.<br> [Jack] Lawyer?<br> I don't need a lawyer, do I?<br> No, of course not.<br> Just say it. That's all.<br> [Speaking French]<br> - Where'd Twombley get shot?<br> - In the chest.<br> - No. I mean whereabouts.<br> - About a half mile in,<br> along the old lumber road.<br> The old lumber road, huh? That's a<br> steep climb. You bring him up yourself?<br> Ambulance guys lugged him up.<br> - You stayed away?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where'd you get that blood?<br> - What blood?<br> On your sleeve.<br> Must've... Ahh.<br> How do I know?<br> - What are you doing, playing cop?<br> - [Laughing]<br> I gotta make a report to Fish and Game.<br> I'm just wondering, that's all.<br> - What'd he do?<br> - Who the fuck knows?<br> Must've slipped or something.<br> I just heard the gun go off.<br> I've never seen a man get shot before.<br> Not even in the service.<br> Must be somethin'.<br> - I didn't actually see it. Like I said.<br> - Sure you did.<br> - What?<br> - Saw him get shot.<br> What the fuck are you telling me?<br> I never seen the guy get shot.<br> You must've seen him get shot!<br> I know you did!<br> Let's get the fuck outta here.<br> You're not making any sense.<br> There's your old 20-gauge, and that's<br> that new Browning you were showing me.<br> Oh, look at this.<br> That must be Twombley's gun.<br> It's brand-new.<br> Very fancy tooling, huh?<br> Probably only been fired one time.<br> But what the hell, Jack? I guess you<br> deserve it. Right's right, huh?<br> Twombley sure as hell<br> won't be shooting it again.<br> - I gotta turn it in to Fish and Game.<br> - Yeah, I was goin' to.<br> Sure, you were.<br> - [Wade] Rolfe?<br> - [Rolfe Over Phone] Yeah, Wade?<br> Brother, look.<br> I was calling 'cause...<br> Has there been anything on TV in Boston<br> about a hunting accident...<br> involving a guy named Twombley,<br> Evan Twombley?<br> [Rolfe] There was something.<br> It happened up your way.<br> Yeah. Yeah, I know him.<br> I mean, the kid that was with him.<br> Maybe you did too.<br> Jack Hewitt.<br> He works for LaRiviere with me.<br> He's my best friend.<br> Wade, it's late.<br> I know you're probably at Toby's.<br> But I'm in bed reading.<br> We have different habits.<br> No, no. Not tonight.<br> I'm in bed too.<br> I was calling 'cause<br> I need you to listen. I got this theory.<br> [Wade]<br> Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot.<br> [Gunshot]<br> Lt'll come out that Jack lied,<br> and the kid'll hang for it.<br> He was scheduled to testify<br> for a committee...<br> investigating organized crime in<br> New England, the construction business.<br> - Who?<br> - Twombley.<br> - No shit!<br> - Why? Do you think Jack shot him?<br> - Well, it was an accident.<br> - They were out deer hunting, right?<br> [Gunshot]<br> [Wade]<br> Maybe there was a third person.<br> [Rolfe]<br> Hmm.<br> Lillian was here. In Lawford.<br> - Night before the shooting.<br> - How was she?<br> She came to pick up Jill.<br> She was supposed to spend<br> the weekend for Halloween,<br> but she wanted to go home.<br> - Who?<br> - Jill.<br> I was thinking of getting a lawyer.<br> Maybe you can help me.<br> - What happened?<br> - A divorce lawyer.<br> No, a custody lawyer.<br> You know, 'cause of Jill.<br> Don't think about it.<br> You're exhausted.<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> Get some sleep.<br> I get to feeling like<br> a whipped dog some days.<br> Some night I'm gonna bite back.<br> I swear it.<br> Haven't you already done<br> a bit of that?<br> No, no, I haven't.<br> Not really.<br> I've growled a little,<br> but I haven't bit.<br> [Knocking On Door]<br> It's okay, sweetie.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm Wade Whitehouse.<br> Is your husband here?<br> He's asleep.<br> We were up very late last night.<br> I just wanted to say I'm really sorry<br> about your father, Mrs. Twombley.<br> Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.<br> Yeah. Yeah, sure.<br> I just had a little business<br> to do with Mr. Gordon.<br> - I'm the local police officer.<br> - Something about my father?<br> No, no, no. It's just a traffic thing.<br> It's no big deal.<br> Can it wait then?<br> Whitehouse, next time,<br> phone ahead.<br> [Laughing]<br> Jesus Christ, Mr. Gordon.<br> When I come all the way out here<br> to serve somebody a summons,<br> I don't call ahead.<br> What the hell<br> are you talking about?<br> I'm issuing you a ticket.<br> A moving violation.<br> Moving violation?<br> I just get out of bed,<br> and you're talking about<br> a goddamn speeding ticket?<br> - Yesterday you passed a stopped<br> school bus which had a flashing...<br> - Hold on.<br> Don't ever put your hands on me,<br> Mr. Gordon.<br> You're talkin' about a goddamned ticket<br> from the time I passed you...<br> while you were dreaming of<br> becoming a traffic cop or something.<br> [Paper Rustling]<br> There's your ticket.<br> You get the hell outta<br> my house now, asshole.<br> You'll be a lucky asshole if I haven't<br> got you fired by the end of the day.<br> I could do that. Just one phone call.<br> I'm pissed enough to do it.<br> [Margie]<br> Jack's kind of sensitive, I guess.<br> Heard he was drunk at Toby's last night<br> and got in a fight with Hettie.<br> He drove off without her.<br> I'm sure. I'm positive it didn't<br> happen the way Jack says it did.<br> Jack's turned into one of those men<br> who are permanently angry.<br> He used to be a sweet kid.<br> When he found out he couldn't<br> play ball anymore, he changed.<br> Now he's like everyone else.<br> I've been wondering<br> if maybe Jack shot Twombley,<br> instead of Twombley<br> shooting himself.<br> [Wade] I wonder if maybe<br> Jack shot him on purpose.<br> [Gunshot]<br> Wade! How can you even<br> think such a thing?<br> Why would Jack Hewitt do that?<br> Shoot Twombley on purpose?<br> Money.<br> - Jack doesn't need money.<br> - Everybody needs money.<br> Except Twombley and that son of a bitch<br> son-in-law of his. People like that.<br> - Jack wouldn't kill for it.<br> Besides, who'd pay him?<br> - Lots of people.<br> A guy like Twombley probably got<br> lots of people who want to see him dead.<br> The government's investigating<br> his links to the Mafia.<br> [Laughing]<br> Oh, the Mafia hired Jack Hewitt?<br> [Laughing]<br> No, no.<br> I just know Jack's lying<br> about how it happened.<br> He seemed... tight, you know?<br> I know that kid. I know what he's like<br> inside. He's like me when I was his age.<br> You wouldn't have done anything<br> like that, shoot somebody for money.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Not for money.<br> But if somebody'd give me half a damned<br> excuse... I was pretty fucked up.<br> But you're not anymore.<br> When are you gonna get<br> that tooth fixed?<br> - Oh, yeah, I can see<br> what you looked like as a kid.<br> - You knew me when I was a kid.<br> No, not really. Not what you<br> looked like. I never studied your face.<br> Hmm. I never really...<br> could see you as a kid when<br> you were a kid until now, this way.<br> In what way?<br> After making love.<br> I like it. It's nice to see that<br> in a grown-up person.<br> It's kind of scary.<br> - But it's nice.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'll get us a beer.<br> - Okay.<br> Don't you think...<br> Do you really think<br> it's a good idea to press...<br> this custody thing right now?<br> Sure. Why not?<br> I don't know.<br> It's just... Seems like...<br> I'm her father.<br> Supposed to be, but I'm not able to.<br> Yeah. Yes, I do.<br> You know, maybe the only thing<br> in my life...<br> that I've been<br> so sure about wanting.<br> Even if it takes a big fight.<br> Well, then I guess you have to.<br> There's another thing<br> I've been thinking about.<br> I don't know how you feel<br> about the idea, 'cause<br> we've never talked about it.<br> But I've been thinking...<br> I've been thinking we should<br> get married sometime. You and me.<br> - Oh, Wade.<br> - It's just... It's just<br> a thought, that's all.<br> - You've been married twice.<br> - Yeah, but it was to the same woman.<br> I was just a kid.<br> It's not like<br> a marriage proposal or anything.<br> It's just a thought, an idea.<br> Something for you and me<br> to think about, you know.<br> - All right. I'll think about it.<br> - Good.<br> [Pop]<br> I've got sons, goddamn it!<br> My God, have I got sons!<br> Wade? Rolfe?<br> Elbourne?<br> You love me, boys?<br> You love your Pop?<br> [Chuckling]<br> Of course you do.<br> Glen, come on, please.<br> Oh, Christ, Sally!<br> You are such a good person.<br> Capital "G."<br> By God, you are...<br> You are so much better than I am.<br> I who am no goddamn good at all.<br> And you,<br> you are a truly good person...<br> like a fucking saint!<br> Fucking beyond compare!<br> - Glen, don't. Come on.<br> - Get away!<br> Whoa! My, my,<br> look at my big boy here,<br> bursting out of the seams<br> of his jeans.<br> - You little prick!<br> - Glen, don't!<br> [Mom, Wade Crying]<br> Yeah, well...<br> [Chuckles]<br> [Margie]<br> Did you tell them that we were coming?<br> Don't you think it's proper for a fella<br> to introduce his girl to his parents?<br> I know your parents.<br> I just gotta pick up my divorce papers<br> for the lawyer. It won't take long.<br> You're really gonna do that?<br> That custody thing?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Oh, God.<br> I think you'll be sorry. I think you'll<br> wish you'd never opened this up again.<br> Maybe. But I'd be a hell<br> of a lot sorrier if I just let it go.<br> Kids grow up fast<br> and then it's over.<br> You get old, your kids are strangers.<br> Look at me and my old man.<br> Your father's not like you.<br> That's why you and he are strangers.<br> That's my whole point.<br> I don't want to get into that.<br> And Lillian's not like your mother.<br> She won't roll over.<br> She'll fight you like a she-bear.<br> If Lillian had been like my mother,<br> I wouldn't have to be doing any of this.<br> Are you sure they're home?<br> Well, the truck's still here.<br> Looks like they stayed inside<br> since the snowfall.<br> That's strange.<br> You think they're all right?<br> Yeah, of course.<br> I would've heard.<br> - How?<br> - I don't know, for chrissake!<br> Pop?<br> [Wade]<br> Hey, Pop, you okay?<br> Huh?<br> Oh.<br> Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold,<br> dressed like that?<br> Huh? Oh.<br> Where's Ma?<br> Ah, she's sleeping.<br> Oh.<br> You remember Margie Fogg?<br> Oh. From Wickham's?<br> Hello, Mr. Whitehouse.<br> Ah. You, ah, like<br> some coffee or something?<br> No, thanks.<br> How are you and Ma doing?<br> I haven't seen you in town.<br> We're all right.<br> Yeah, we're all right.<br> Uh, she's sleeping.<br> You want me to go up and get her?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh.<br> Jesus. Nothing's<br> changed around here.<br> - It's freezing in here.<br> - Yeah, yeah. I'll put some wood on.<br> Close the door would help.<br> Don't. It's bad for you.<br> - Maybe they're too old<br> to be staying here.<br> - Maybe so.<br> [Footsteps, Pop Coughing]<br> Where's Mom?<br> Ah, she's comin'.<br> [Margie] Have you been heating<br> the house? Not just with the stove.<br> Well, there's a furnace here.<br> - You're not using it today?<br> - Well, l...<br> It's broken or something.<br> There's an electric<br> up in the bedroom.<br> Maybe Wade oughta take a look at it.<br> Your pipes will freeze.<br> - Would you do that, Wade?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Ah...<br> Ma?<br> Ma?<br> [Whispering]<br> Hey, Ma.<br> Ma, come on, wake up.<br> [Whispering]<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> Oh, Lord.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> Wade?<br> Is, uh...<br> [Sighs]<br> She's dead then?<br> Yep.<br> When did she die?<br> I checked on her.<br> I brought the electric up.<br> The cold bothers her<br> more than it does me.<br> That's why I brought<br> the electric up and...<br> - Don't you have a telephone?<br> - It's in the living room.<br> Why didn't you call<br> and have the furnace fixed?<br> Oh, Wade.<br> I thought she was all right.<br> Till this morning, she was.<br> It makes me sad!<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> Makes me sad it was her<br> instead of me.<br> God!<br> Oh.<br> I should've froze.<br> [Rolfe Narrating]<br> Wade called me, as usual, late at night.<br> I knew it was Wade.<br> No one else calls me at that hour.<br> And I was ready to listen to another<br> chapter in one of his ongoing sagas.<br> There was the detective story concerning<br> the shooting of Evan Twombley,<br> and the family melodrama<br> about Wade's custody fight with Lillian.<br> But not this time.<br> Wade was telling<br> a different story, or so it seemed then,<br> one in which I myself was a character.<br> He had called to tell me<br> that some time the previous night...<br> he had discovered<br> our mother had died,<br> and he'd discovered the body<br> when he went over to visit her<br> and our father with Margie Fogg.<br> It was left to me to tell<br> our sister Lena and her husband Clyde...<br> who'd gone overweight and<br> made Jesus Christ their personal Savior.<br> Pop was okay, but out of it.<br> Worse than usual, maybe,<br> though no drunker than usual.<br> [Woman]<br> How 'bout you, Rolfe? Are you saved?<br> No, I'm not.<br> But then you'll be in hell.<br> I guess I will.<br> Me and Mom and Wade and Pop.<br> We'll all be there together.<br> [Wade]<br> Shouldn't we get this show on the road?<br> Well, pointless to stand around<br> in church, I guess, with nothing to do.<br> What about Jill?<br> Is Lillian bringing her?<br> They'll be at the church<br> and the cemetery.<br> Anyone else want another beer?<br> Rolfe?<br> No, thanks.<br> I don't drink.<br> Yeah, I forgot. Sorry.<br> How are you holding up, Wade?<br> Oh, I'm fine.<br> - Are you Rolfe?<br> - Yes.<br> Gordon. Gordon LaRiviere.<br> I remember you from high school.<br> You're a teacher now? Hmm?<br> - Harvard?<br> - B.U.<br> Oh. I don't see you around.<br> I don't suppose there's much reason<br> for you to come this way.<br> - Come on, Pop.<br> - [Pop] Hmm?<br> - Join us.<br> - Huh?<br> Reverend?<br> Let's kneel for a moment of prayer<br> before the service.<br> Wade? Rolfe?<br> - [Whispering] This is nuts.<br> - Wade.<br> - Jesus in heaven,<br> - Oh!<br> We come to Thee on our knees,<br> begging for Thy forgiveness.<br> And thanking Thee for<br> the undeserved gift of Thy salvation.<br> We thank Thee, whose blood<br> was shed that we may live.<br> - [Lena] Praise the Lord!<br> - [Everyone] Praise the Lord.<br> Oh, God, not one of you<br> is worth a single hair<br> on that woman's head! God!<br> Please look down upon this woman,<br> our mother and friend,<br> and make her example<br> known to us.<br> Not one of you is worth a goddamned hair<br> on that good woman's head!<br> - Pop!<br> - Jesus! What is this shit?<br> - I'll head on to the church.<br> - [Reverend] This is a difficult time.<br> - Pop, it's no big deal.<br> - Oh, smart guy.<br> Tell me it's no big deal?<br> I just... Tell me...<br> there's a single one of you<br> that's worth one single hair<br> on that woman's gray head!<br> - Pop?<br> - What?<br> Jesus is more powerful<br> than any demon.<br> - Oh, go fuck yourself!<br> - Wade, just leave it.<br> Yeah, just listen<br> to your little brother here.<br> "Wade, just leave it."<br> Candy-asses.<br> All of you.<br> That's what I've got for children.<br> Jesus freaks and candy-asses!<br> Oh. "Just leave it, Wade.<br> Praise the Lord!<br> Just leave it, Wade."<br> - Stop, Glen Whitehouse!<br> - Goddamn it! Come on, girl!<br> If you ever touch her again,<br> I'll kill you! I swear it!<br> [Pop] You're still standing up<br> for your little brother, huh?<br> [Reverend]<br> For as much as it hath pleased<br> Almighty God of His great mercy...<br> [Rolfe Narrating]<br> It snowed the day of the funeral.<br> The snow line had descended<br> from Canada weeks before...<br> and was now well south of Lawford,<br> creeping across New Hampshire<br> towards Massachusetts.<br> [Reverend] In sure and certain hope<br> of the Resurrection to enteral life,<br> through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br> Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,<br> dust to dust.<br> Amen.<br> Pop, let's go back to the house.<br> - Hey, Dad.<br> - Hey.<br> [Coughs]<br> I'm glad you came.<br> Can you stay for a while?<br> No.<br> You ever go to<br> your father's grave anymore?<br> No, not anymore.<br> It's too far.<br> We should talk.<br> - We've done all our talking, Wade.<br> - It's just that...<br> No, please don't.<br> I'm sorry about your mother.<br> I really liked her.<br> You never know how much<br> women like that suffer.<br> Like they live their whole lives<br> with the sound turned off.<br> Then they're gone.<br> - Mom?<br> - Huh?<br> - She's got an ice skating<br> lesson at 4:00.<br> - I'm taking ice skating, Dad.<br> [Chuckles]<br> That's great.<br> - Figure skating, I suppose.<br> - And ice ballet.<br> That's great.<br> Well...<br> Good-bye, Dad.<br> [Car Engine Revving]<br> - What about Margie?<br> - What about her?<br> You still plan on<br> getting married?<br> Oh, yeah. She'll probably quit her job<br> and move out here with Pop.<br> We can't leave him alone anymore.<br> He'll probably set<br> the damn place on fire.<br> And with Jill here a lot,<br> it'll be good to have Margie around.<br> [Grunts]<br> Things are gonna change<br> in that department, by the way.<br> I got a custody lawyer down in Concord.<br> I'm gonna see him tomorrow.<br> All hell's gonna break loose, but it'll<br> be worth it. Here, put the shovels away.<br> - [Engine Revving]<br> - I wanna let it run out of gas.<br> I don't want the bastard drivin' drunk.<br> He's drunk all the time now.<br> After, we'll hide the keys.<br> Anything new about<br> the shooting? Twombley?<br> No. I guess it was an accident<br> like everybody thinks.<br> Want to know what<br> I think happened?<br> You find them everywhere.<br> I think your first response<br> to the shooting was the correct one.<br> - Which is?<br> - That it wasn't an accident.<br> Well, then who shot him?<br> Your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.<br> [Chuckling]<br> Jack.<br> Come on, Rolfe.<br> Give me a motive.<br> - Money.<br> - Money? Who'd pay 'im<br> that kind of money?<br> Not the mob.<br> They got their own guys. Specialists.<br> Who else benefits<br> if Twombley is suddenly dead?<br> - I don't know. You tell me.<br> - Okay.<br> It's likely there are people<br> in the union who don't want<br> Twombley to testify.<br> That probably includes his son-in-law,<br> who's vice president,<br> and will probably be<br> the next president.<br> - I read that in the papers.<br> Uh, what's his name?<br> - Mel Gordon.<br> - Mel Gordon, right.<br> - The guy in the B.M.W., right?<br> Okay, here's my theory.<br> Twombley, he doesn't know<br> about illegal loans or whatever,<br> and he starts to nose around because<br> of the investigation, and he finds out.<br> Finds out his son-in-law is involved.<br> So Mel Gordon wouldn't want<br> a professional hit.<br> That makes the Feds dig deeper.<br> He wants it to look like an accident.<br> A hunting accident's perfect.<br> [Chuckling] Around here,<br> you shoot somebody in the woods,<br> you say it was an accident,<br> they fine you 50 bucks and<br> they lift your hunting license.<br> And Jack, he...<br> Jack's probably sayin' the guy shot<br> himself 'cause he ain't got his deer,<br> and he don't want<br> his license lifted.<br> Nah. That's too neat.<br> Things ain't that neat.<br> - Some things are.<br> - Only in books.<br> It's what happened.<br> That makes me mad.<br> That somebody can shoot somebody,<br> his own father-in-law,<br> and not be punished for it.<br> - Don't that piss you off?<br> - No, not particularly.<br> Right's right, goddamn it. Jesus, Rolfe.<br> Don't you care about what's right?<br> I care about what happened.<br> The truth.<br> Remember, I'm a student<br> of history. Books.<br> I've been thinkin' about<br> that story you told me...<br> about Pop...<br> and chopping the firewood<br> out of the ice and after.<br> I don't want to disappoint you,<br> but I don't think it happened.<br> - You don't think I'd remember<br> a thing like that?<br> - It wasn't me.<br> I wasn't there.<br> When I heard about it, it was Elbourne.<br> Elbourne, Jesus. We'd have<br> to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.<br> And Elbourne and Mom<br> brought you to the doctor...<br> and told him<br> you fell from the hayloft.<br> [Laughing]<br> I never heard that one.<br> No, I remember clearly because...<br> after I heard, I became<br> real careful around Pop.<br> I was a careful child...<br> and I became a careful adult.<br> But at least I was never afflicted<br> by that man's violence.<br> [Laughing]<br> That's what you think.<br> [Laughing]<br> Ahh!<br> I better head back.<br> It's a long drive.<br> All right.<br> Okay.<br> [Jack]<br> Ready, Jimmy?<br> Put out that cigarette!<br> [LaRiviere]<br> Not there, asshole. Strip it.<br> - Morning, Gordon.<br> - Morning, Wade.<br> Hey, Jack.<br> - I'm fuckin' out of here.<br> - What, Lawford?<br> Out of this fucking job.<br> This job sucks.<br> Workin' outside<br> in the winter sucks.<br> - Open the door, will you?<br> - Why don't you quit now,<br> you want out so bad?<br> - Open the door. We're late.<br> - No, I mean it, Jack.<br> You got enough money now.<br> Head out to California. Surf's up, Jack.<br> - And you digging wells in the snow.<br> - What do you mean I got money?<br> - I'm as broke as you.<br> - Looney Tunes, Jack.<br> Fucking Looney Tunes.<br> [Wade]<br> You think you're getting away with it?<br> [Elaine]<br> Mr. Gordon!<br> - Is the boss in?<br> - Yes, indeedy.<br> [Wade]<br> I screwed up the divorce.<br> I agreed to everything<br> that she said.<br> I just wanted her to like me.<br> I wanted to be a good father.<br> I have the documents.<br> You know,<br> [Clears Throat]<br> It would help if you were married,<br> if there was someone at home<br> while you're at work.<br> I plan to soon.<br> How soon?<br> - Next spring.<br> - It would help...<br> if there was some change in circumstance<br> since this was drawn,<br> if there was some drug or alcohol abuse<br> on the part of your ex-wife.<br> Sexual problems upsetting the child.<br> I'm sorry!<br> But these are the things<br> we're gonna have to explore<br> if we want to contest this document.<br> - Does it have to get that messy?<br> - Absolutely.<br> This is just the tip of the iceberg,<br> Mr. Whitehouse.<br> I hope you understand<br> what I'm saying.<br> Looks kind of hopeless, don't it?<br> No, not really. I'll have<br> another look at the divorce decree,<br> see if we can get it redrawn.<br> But at some point, I'm going<br> to have to interview your daughter.<br> - It's Jill, right?<br> - Yes.<br> You got an ashtray?<br> I'll need a $500 retainer.<br> You can just mail it to me.<br> [Exhales]<br> - How much is the whole thing<br> gonna cost?<br> - It's hard to say.<br> But if we go for custody, there's<br> depositions, psychiatric evaluations.<br> But if we just want to get<br> the visitation rights redrawn,<br> assuming they're unduly restrictive,<br> it wouldn't be more than $3,500.<br> Oh.<br> It might be in your best interest<br> legally as well as financially<br> to just go for...<br> I know. The custody thing wasn't<br> just my trying to get back at her.<br> I'm not as dumb as I look.<br> I didn't say you<br> looked dumb, Mr. Whitehouse.<br> I love my daughter.<br> I'll send you the $500.<br> [Wade]<br> I'm sorry about the long lunch.<br> My transmission's going out again.<br> Did you ever think about<br> getting a new car?<br> On what you pay me?<br> Elaine, call Chub Merritt, have him pick<br> up Wade's shitbox, fix the transmission.<br> [Elaine]<br> What?<br> Call Chub Merritt, have him pick up<br> Wade's car, fix the transmission.<br> I'll bill the repair<br> to the town.<br> You can use my four-by-four.<br> You're the town police officer.<br> The town police officer<br> should have a decent car.<br> Well, you want a new car or not?<br> - What do I have to do for it?<br> - Nothing.<br> You know, Wade,<br> I've been thinking.<br> You don't get enough<br> appreciation around here.<br> - Uh-uh. I saw Mel Gordon<br> in here this morning.<br> - So?<br> He say anything about<br> that summons I tried to give him?<br> Son of a bitch wouldn't accept it.<br> - Wade, "dat" wasn't smart.<br> - "That?"<br> Going out right after<br> the man's father-in-law shot himself.<br> It's pronounced "that,"<br> not "dat." That.<br> - That.<br> - Yeah.<br> Let it go.<br> Call it a favor to me.<br> You? Why?<br> Well, Mel's doing<br> some business with me.<br> It's nice to do a favor for people<br> you do business with.<br> He was in a hurry.<br> It's no big deal.<br> - That was before Twombley<br> was shot, before he knew.<br> - What's the difference?<br> Take my truck, take a rest.<br> Stop worrying about Mel Gordon.<br> Have you decided what to do<br> with your old man's place yet?<br> You oughta sell it,<br> move into town.<br> - You wanna buy?<br> - Don't light that here. I'm allergic.<br> - I won't. You interested?<br> - Maybe.<br> - You and Mel Gordon?<br> - Could be.<br> - Always count on Wade<br> for a good screwing, huh?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Why should you guys make all the money?<br> You, Mel and Jack.<br> - Right's right.<br> - I asked you not to light<br> that fucking thing in here.<br> Get out of here<br> with that smoke!<br> [Coughs]<br> [Truck Door Closes]<br> [Rolfe's Voice]<br> A hunting accident's perfect.<br> Anything new<br> about the shooting?<br> I think your first response<br> to the shooting was the correct one.<br> Your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.<br> He's my favorite.<br> Money. Hunting accident.<br> I bet it wasn't an accident.<br> - [Jack's Voice]<br> It wasn't me. I wasn't there.<br> - [Wade's Voice] The truth.<br> [Wade] Remember, it may have happened,<br> but not the way you said.<br> It's what happened<br> not because it's neat.<br> [Rolfe] Twombley's sudden death.<br> Killing was the correct one.<br> [Wade]<br> The truth, remember.<br> You crazy son of a bitch!<br> You almost killed us both!<br> Get off the fuckin' ice!<br> Get off!<br> What're you runnin' from, Jack?<br> We're gonna talk.<br> Stay back. I'll shoot you.<br> I'll fuckin' shoot you dead<br> if you don't get back in that truck.<br> You ain't shootin' shit.<br> Now put the gun away.<br> Tell me what happened.<br> Don't move!<br> I'll shoot you dead if you move.<br> [Chuckles]<br> [Gun Cocks, Rifle Shots]<br> [Groaning]<br> [Groaning]<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Stop that!<br> Who? Me?<br> I didn't do nothin'.<br> [Sighs]<br> Just look what a good job I done here.<br> You haven't done anything. I should've<br> left you at home to stew in your drink.<br> Damn right you should have.<br> It's about time.<br> Your father's here.<br> Marge got to baby-sit him.<br> She moved in with you, huh?<br> - What happened?<br> - Don't even ask.<br> My, my, my.<br> The prodigal son.<br> About fuckin' time too.<br> I got me a new job.<br> Second cook and bottle washer.<br> Pop, for chrissake,<br> let's go home.<br> I'm sorry. I got waylaid.<br> The hell you got waylaid.<br> You follow your prick around<br> like it was your nose, for chrissake!<br> Can it, Whitehouse.<br> Get him out of here.<br> - It was funny at first, but I'm tired.<br> - Let's go home.<br> What home is that?<br> Is that your home or my home?<br> You're a fuckin' sly, Wade.<br> Now, your mom's dead. She can't<br> make any excuses for you anymore.<br> You've got to deal with me now.<br> No more sugar tit, sonny!<br> - For chrissake, Pop. Let's go home.<br> - Don't give me any of your lip.<br> - Get out of this fast.<br> - I can't.<br> Are you pushing me?<br> - Come on. My God.<br> - Don't push me!<br> - You think you can take me now?<br> Just come on.<br> - Come on.<br> - Just get in the car.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Just get in the car.<br> - Get in. Just get in.<br> - Wimp!<br> [Pop]<br> Why don't you grow up?<br> You never could stand up<br> for yourself!<br> Goddamn it!<br> - You could never understand<br> what it's about.<br> - I wish you'd die!<br> Oh, stop it!<br> Just stop it! Stop it!<br> [Wade's Voice] No shit, Rolfe.<br> I glanced up and there he was,<br> only it was me.<br> But it was like<br> I had never seen myself before.<br> It was a stranger's face.<br> It's hard to explain.<br> You fly on automatic pilot, like I was<br> doing all night, and you disappear.<br> Then you accidentally see your body,<br> or your face, or whatever,<br> and you don't know<br> who in the hell it belongs to.<br> Strange.<br> It's the business with the old man,<br> I know, and how incredibly<br> pissed I was at him,<br> and chasing Jack Hewitt<br> and the goddamned truck,<br> not to mention Margie's being upset.<br> One thing on top of another.<br> [Rolfe]<br> Wade, are you all right?<br> You gotta hear this.<br> You won't believe it.<br> Mel Gordon had come by<br> to visit LaRiviere.<br> So they're in the office.<br> Mel Gordon realized<br> that I was onto them.<br> Mel thinks he can buy me off.<br> But LaRiviere,<br> he knew that wouldn't work.<br> Mel Gordon may be able<br> to buy off LaRiviere. That's one thing.<br> But not me.<br> How could a guy like Jack Hewitt<br> get into a mess like this?<br> - [Alma] Coffee?<br> - [Wade] Thank you, Alma.<br> - You want milk and sugar?<br> - No, no. Black is fine.<br> I like it this way.<br> You got yourself<br> a new computer, huh?<br> I've been putting<br> all my files into it.<br> You all right, Wade?<br> Yeah. I got this damn tooth.<br> It's killing me.<br> Got a few things bugging me,<br> just like everybody else.<br> I'm okay.<br> I don't mean to pry.<br> I'm sorry about your mother.<br> It was a nice funeral.<br> It's over now.<br> Alma,<br> I think there's some dirty business<br> goin' on in this town.<br> I know that.<br> There always has been.<br> No, no. I think this is a little worse<br> than you and I are used to.<br> I'm talkin' about murder,<br> among other things.<br> - Who?<br> - Twombley. Evan Twombley.<br> The union boss official<br> who got shot.<br> - Somebody murdered him.<br> - Who would...<br> [Clears Throat]<br> You know Jack Hewitt,<br> the kid I work with?<br> Well, I think Jack shot him.<br> You know, Twombley was<br> the father-in-law of Mel Gordon.<br> That's a friend of LaRiviere's.<br> I don't know what<br> the connection is yet,<br> but LaRiviere had Jack<br> take him out hunting,<br> pretending it was an accident.<br> [Rifle Shot]<br> If Jack told the truth, he could<br> be free by the time he's my age.<br> Sometimes things<br> are simpler than you think.<br> - Let me ask you a question.<br> - You don't believe me?<br> About Jack? No.<br> Have you checked out the tax bill<br> on your father's farm lately?<br> Um, I know he's been due<br> for a couple of years.<br> I was thinkin' of paying it<br> when the insurance comes in.<br> Has anybody offered to buy it?<br> Yeah. Matter of fact, LaRiviere.<br> These are all<br> the real estate transactions<br> in this town for the last year.<br> Most of it is unused land. Most of it is<br> for little more than back taxes owed.<br> How's Lillian?<br> She's fine.<br> That's three years ago.<br> It's quite a difference, hmm?<br> What's the North Country<br> Development Association?<br> Went down to Concord.<br> I checked it out.<br> Mel Gordon is the president.<br> And the vice president<br> and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere.<br> They're buying up the whole mountain.<br> $364,000 last year.<br> I believe that's a little<br> outside of LaRiviere's league.<br> - Is Twombley involved?<br> - No.<br> Hmm.<br> He must've found out.<br> They had to get rid of him.<br> And Jack...<br> Jack will get blamed for it.<br> All these figures show is that...<br> Gordon LaRiviere is gonna be a very rich<br> man because of his being a selectman.<br> In a year or two,<br> you're not gonna recognize this town.<br> Oh, boy. Oh, boy!<br> You sneaky son of a bitch!<br> I got your number now!<br> All these years<br> I thought you were a decent man.<br> Ran around feeling grateful to you.<br> Can you believe that? Grateful!<br> - You're fired!<br> - He's using us.<br> - We're his slaves. We're alike.<br> - What were you doing with my truck?<br> - Are you a quitter? Quitter!<br> - You're finished. Gimme the keys.<br> I give it with pleasure.<br> I'm free of you.<br> - You're not on my back anymore.<br> You see how easy it is?<br> - Keep your hands off me.<br> I'll handle this.<br> Break it up. Break it up, Wade!<br> Break it up! Wade!<br> You ain't gettin' away with this!<br> You ain't gettin' away with it!<br> Stay out of it, Jimmy. You're fired.<br> I want the shop keys. Where are they?<br> Wade, get out of here! Just go!<br> I gotta call my brother.<br> [Door Closes]<br> [Wade's Voice]<br> Yeah, I know what it means.<br> I'm just runnin' out of ways to use it.<br> - [Rolfe's Voice] Why? For what?<br> - To help Jack.<br> To nail those sons of bitches.<br> You know, the two Gordons.<br> That's what Alma calls them.<br> Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?<br> [Rolfe] Wade, listen.<br> Take care of the little things first,<br> the things that are distracting you<br> from taking care of the big things.<br> Call Chub Merritt,<br> get your car back.<br> Call a dentist<br> and get your tooth pulled.<br> Forget about the hunting accident.<br> Let it go.<br> - [Groaning]<br> - Wade?<br> - Chick.<br> - The good news is,<br> we haven't got to your car yet.<br> - The bad news...<br> - Just tell me when you have it fixed.<br> The bad news is there's a problem with<br> Gordon's truck, which somebody shot up.<br> - Figured you'd know<br> something about that, Wade.<br> - Yeah, I know about that.<br> LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay<br> for fixing your car.<br> It's a couple hundred<br> for the transmission.<br> I got more bad news.<br> Wanna hear it?<br> - Yeah, tell me.<br> - Chub says you're fired.<br> He can't fire me.<br> LaRiviere already did that this morning.<br> Your other job for the town.<br> Chub's a selectman. Said to turn<br> your badge in and clean out your office.<br> What do you mean you can't<br> take me today? I told you it's...<br> Shit! Shit! Shit!<br> - [Margie] Wade?<br> - What?<br> What in the world<br> is happening to you?<br> - Why are you acting this way?<br> - It's my tooth! It's my goddamn tooth!<br> I can't even think anymore<br> because of it.<br> You got fired this morning,<br> didn't ya?<br> Margie, look.<br> That's temporary, believe me.<br> There's so much shit that's gonna<br> hit the fan in the next few days,<br> and my getting fired by LaRiviere<br> and Merritt won't matter a bit.<br> I'll get another job.<br> People are gonna need me.<br> After this is over,<br> they're gonna make me<br> into a goddamn hero!<br> You wait, you'll see. I'll deliver.<br> I'll be the best father that ever lived.<br> You need me. Even Pop!<br> For chrissake, he needs me!<br> This town needs me!<br> I'll get another job.<br> Maybe right now...<br> they think they can send me howling<br> into the corner like a kicked dog!<br> But by God,<br> it'll be different soon!<br> Always been a whiner. God!<br> Now, my old man, there was...<br> There was a real man.<br> He let no woman push him around.<br> Worked till the day he died.<br> Yeah, men like him<br> were real men.<br> And women knew their place.<br> There was no confusion.<br> Women respected men then.<br> It wasn't like it is today...<br> Be careful what you say,<br> Glen Whitehouse.<br> I know you.<br> My mother knew your wife.<br> Oh, what she went through.<br> Don't you sass me, damn it!<br> You think you're<br> pretty hot stuff, huh?<br> Well, you're gettin' old too.<br> And there's not a goddamn thing<br> a woman can do about that.<br> Is there?<br> [Laughing]<br> - [Groans]<br> - Gimme the bottle.<br> - Sure.<br> - [Door Slams Shut]<br> [Grunts]<br> [Panting]<br> [Sighing]<br> [Rolfe Narrating]<br> You will say that I should've known...<br> terrible things<br> were about to happen.<br> You will say<br> that I was responsible.<br> But even so, what could<br> I have done by then?<br> Wade lived on the edge<br> of his emotions.<br> He was always first to receive<br> the brunt of our father's anger.<br> He had no perspective<br> to retreat to,<br> even in a crisis.<br> [Coughs]<br> [Doorbell Chiming]<br> Wait there.<br> She'll be right out.<br> I thought we'd go<br> out to the farm, see my dad.<br> - Get your boots.<br> - Hi, honey.<br> - Have her home tomorrow night by 6:00.<br> - That's no problem.<br> Lillian, I'm sorry. I had<br> this damn tooth, and I got it pulled.<br> - God, you make me sick.<br> - What?<br> I can't believe<br> you would sink this low.<br> - Low as what? What have I done?<br> - Your lawyer called.<br> Yeah. Is that bad to want<br> to see your own daughter?<br> Don't play dumb.<br> For what this will do to her,<br> this kid you say you love so much.<br> Love, Wade?<br> Really? Shame on you!<br> Shame on you.<br> - [Footsteps Approaching]<br> - Bye, sweetie. Call me tonight<br> if you feel like it.<br> Are we going in this?<br> Yeah, my car's in the shop.<br> This'll be fine.<br> - It's pretty old.<br> - It belongs to Pop.<br> - Pop?<br> - Yeah, my father. You know who he is.<br> Pop. It's his.<br> Yeah.<br> [Wade]<br> Well, how 'bout a Big Mac?<br> Mom won't let me eat fast food.<br> You know that. It's bad for you.<br> Come on. We can always sneak<br> a Big Mac like we used to.<br> - And a cherry turnover.<br> What do you say, Jillie?<br> - No.<br> - What do you want then?<br> - Nothing.<br> Come on, you can't have nothing.<br> We gotta have lunch.<br> - Mr. Pizzeria?<br> - Same thing, Dad.<br> - Mom says all that food is bad for you.<br> - I don't care what Mom says.<br> I'm in charge today, okay?<br> Okay. We'll get what you want.<br> What do you want?<br> What do I want?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I guess I can wait till we get home.<br> Maybe we'll stop at Wickham's.<br> - Okay.<br> - Fine. Fine.<br> [Sighs]<br> Are you okay?<br> Ah, Jillie, come on.<br> Come on, honey.<br> Don't get sad on me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - What are you sorry for?<br> What am I sorry for?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I guess it was the food business.<br> I just thought we'd sneak a Big Mac<br> on Mommy like we used to.<br> I wanna go home.<br> [Sighs]<br> - You can't.<br> - [Beer Can Pops Open]<br> That's illegal, you know.<br> I know.<br> [Slurping Beer]<br> You're a policeman.<br> No, not anymore.<br> I'm nothin' anymore.<br> Here we go.<br> Go on, grab that pocket.<br> So, what do we want?<br> Come on, Jillie, what do we want?<br> Jillie, Jillie, Jillie!<br> We want a cheese<br> grilled sandwich?<br> It's called<br> a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.<br> [Jill Gasps]<br> - Jill! Jill, I'm sorry.<br> - [Crying]<br> Honey, nothin' happened.<br> Nothin' happened.<br> - I wanna go home.<br> - Oh, yeah. Sure, honey.<br> We'll go home right now.<br> I'm sorry. Nothin' happened.<br> Let's go. Come on.<br> Wade, I got a message for ya.<br> Jack Hewitt, he's lookin' for you.<br> He wants you to clear your stuff<br> out of his office in town hall.<br> - His office? You mean my old office.<br> - That's what he said.<br> I'd stay away from him<br> if I were you.<br> He's real pissed.<br> [Woman]<br> Are you all right, Nick?<br> You goin' somewhere, Margie?<br> I'm just clearing out some of the stuff<br> that's piled up for the rummage sale.<br> And some of it's<br> for the cleaners and the Laundromat.<br> Don't lie to me, Marge.<br> You're leaving me. I can see that.<br> Don't be silly.<br> Hi, Jill.<br> [Sighs]<br> Marge.<br> - [Crying]<br> - Oh, Marge.<br> Oh. Oh.<br> Help me, Marge.<br> Leave me alone!<br> - Leave me alone!<br> - Leave her alone!

I know you!<br> [Laughing]<br> Ah, yes.<br> You. Yeah, you goddamn...<br> son of a bitch.<br> I know you.<br> You're my blood. You're a goddamn<br> fuckin' piece of my heart.<br> You don't know me.<br> You don't know me.<br> Fuck you.<br> Fuck you!<br> You done finally done it.<br> Done it right.<br> Done it like a man done it.<br> Just the way I taught ya.<br> Oh, goddamn!<br> I love you,<br> you mean son of a bitch.<br> - I do.<br> - Love. What do you know about love?<br> Love? Hell,<br> I'm made of love.<br> Call it what you want.<br> Everything you know...<br> - comes from me.<br> - Yeah.<br> Bang!<br> You and me!<br> Where the hell you goin'?<br> Where you goin', Wade? Best you leave<br> my goddamn truck where it is.<br> Wade, I need to...<br> Gimme those keys.<br> Wade! I need to get to town.<br> Crawl.<br> There's hardly any booze left in<br> the house. I gotta get me some Brown's.<br> Hey!<br> It's my house, my money,<br> my goddamn truck!<br> Stolen!<br> You and me.<br> You and me.<br> I don't know you.<br> My own goddamn father,<br> and I don't know you.<br> [Scoffs]<br> You and me.<br> Don't you sass me, goddamn it.<br> [Laughs]<br> [Yelling]<br> [Gasping]<br> I love you too.<br> [Rifle Clicks]<br> Ha. Joke.<br> Pop?<br> Pop?<br> Dad.<br> Dad.<br> [Sniffles]<br> Ahh.<br> [Rolfe Narrating] The historical facts<br> are known by everyone.<br> All of Lawford, all of New Hampshire,<br> some of Massachusetts.<br> Facts do not make history.<br> Our stories, Wade's and mine,<br> describe the lives of the boys and men<br> for thousands of years:<br> Boys who were beaten<br> by their fathers,<br> whose capacity for love and trust<br> was crippled almost at birth,<br> men whose best hope for connection<br> with other human beings...<br> lay in detachment...<br> as if life were over.<br> It's how we keep from destroying<br> in turn our own children...<br> and terrorizing the women<br> who have the misfortune to love us;<br> how we absent ourselves from<br> the tradition of male violence;<br> how we decline<br> the seduction of revenge.<br> Jack's truck turned up three days later<br> in a shopping mall in Toronto.<br> - Wade killed Jack...<br> - [Rifle Shot]<br> Just as surely as Jack<br> did not kill Evan Twombley,<br> even accidentally.<br> The link between Jack and Twombley,<br> LaRiviere and Mel Gordon...<br> existed only<br> in Wade's wild imaginings.<br> And briefly, I admit,<br> in mine as well.<br> LaRiviere and Mel Gordon<br> were indeed in business.<br> The Parker Mountain Ski Resort<br> is now advertised across the country.<br> The community of Lawford,<br> as such, no longer exists.<br> It is an economic zone<br> between Littleton and Catamount.<br> The house is still in Wade's name,<br> and I keep paying taxes on it.<br> It remains empty.<br> Now and then I drive out there<br> and sit in my car,<br> and wonder why not let it go.<br> Why not let LaRiviere buy it and<br> build the condominiums he wants there?<br> We want to believe Wade died<br> that same November,<br> froze to death on a bench<br> or a sidewalk.<br> You cannot understand<br> how a man,<br> a normal man, a man like you and me,<br> could do such a terrible thing.<br> Unless the police happen<br> to arrest a vagrant who<br> turns out to be Wade Whitehouse,<br> there will be<br> no more mention of him.<br> Or his friend Jack Hewitt.<br> Or our father.<br> The story will be over,<br> except that I continue.<br>
