It's nice to see<br> them whack the little ball.<br> Better than whacking<br> the little woman.<br> Maybe you better go a little easy<br> on the sauce, babe.<br> Saying something like that?<br> I haven't touched the sauce.<br> I've been on the gin. And I never said<br> you whacked me, Luchy.<br> Not on the outside.<br> What is it with you, Phyl?<br> I come in here to have a nice dinner<br> and already you're firing shots.<br> What's that?<br> Okay, alright.<br> What did the doctor say?<br> What's that about?<br> He said very little indeed.<br> I seemed to do most of the talking.<br> - What's wrong with you?<br> - Nothing's wrong with me, Lucky.<br> - I'm just taking it as I see it.<br> - And you see plenty, babe.<br> Yeah, from behind my veils...<br> Like, what's her name, the belly dancer?<br> Like her.<br> Phyllis and the Seven Veils.<br> - Dopey, Grumpy, Sleepy...<br> - Happy.<br> Happy.<br> You know the hardest part of all,<br> Lucky...<br> ...is finding out...<br> too late, that none of it lasts.<br> Bulb's got to blow out sooner or later,<br> babe.<br> Yes, it's lights out sooner or later.<br> But you know, the good stuff's still<br> hiding in the dark.<br> In the afterglow.<br> I saw Cassie today.<br> At the Parc des Ecluses.

Or you.<br> She ran away from both of us.<br> She ran away from both of us and<br> since she isn't coming back, let it go.<br> It wasn't her today.<br> I didn't for a minute think<br> she'd be returning to us...<br> ...a couple of selfish fools like us,<br> but I don't know, after 8 years...<br> ...and we're still here, maybe she<br> thought it would be safe.<br> I mean, sometimes I think she'll just<br> appear.<br> Maybe she thinks we've become more...<br> Ioving?<br> She was nice, this girl today.<br> She held herself well.<br> She was carrying a shopping bag.<br> - Am I just making it all up?<br> - Sometimes you lose things, Phyl.<br> And sometimes you find them.<br> Just let it be, what it is.<br> It's lost, I know that.<br> I just want to feel happy or unhappy,<br> just something.<br> You still at the same number, Lucky?<br> I'll call you.<br> - Yeah, same number.<br> - Be right bacvk with the bread.<br> You still feel lots of things.<br> Lucky Mann, you great big old octopus...<br> - All your tentacles waving about.<br> - What do you want me to say, Phyl?<br> Just what the hell do you want me<br> to say?<br> You want me to say that I'm not eager<br> to dry up and live in the past?<br> - Not an octopus.

Any time you say.<br> He'll bring the written estimate over<br> today, and he promised...<br> ...that it wouldn't be a dime<br> over 4,000, for everything.<br> When did you day it was a platinum<br> door lock?<br> I forgot about the door lock.<br> Get it fixed, Marianne.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Jeffrey, we are going to make these<br> changes.<br> - We don't need a baby's room.<br> - Why not?<br> Because we don't need a baby!<br> It's a very tough world out there,<br> Marianne.<br> Not to mention, overcrowded.<br> All the more reason to soften it up<br> a little bit!<br> Isn't that our job?<br> Isn't that our purpose, why we're here?<br> To take a flying leap into the future<br> and spread a little joy along the way?<br> Tell me something. Why did you bother<br> getting married?<br> You don't need kids, you don't need<br> love, you don't need sex...<br> ...you don't need anything<br> but yourself!<br> Come to think of it, you're the most<br> selfish person I've ever met!<br> For your information, I'm not afraid<br> to go this alone, Jeffrey.<br> I'm having a baby,<br> with or without you!<br> - Oh, really?<br> - Really.<br> My, my.<br> The green-eyed monster.<br> No.<br> You're far too stuck on yourself<br> to be jealous.<br> If that's what you really want...<br> ...I don't give a good goddamn.<br> You don't know anything, Jeffrey!<br> You haven't got a clue!<br> I'm having this baby!<br> And you're not invited!<br> You can't even come!<br> Good morning, Mr. Byron.<br> Go away.

I'll go write that down.<br> - All right.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Wow! Okay. Okay.<br> - So, what's your type?<br> - What?<br> - What's your type?<br> - My type?<br> When you're being careful.<br> There's a certain type that I am<br> careful with.<br> But I trust the ones that never sleep<br> around but who feel like getting lucky.<br> - It's a matter of trust, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's a matter of trust.<br> My God, you're a fine looking woman.<br> I forgot the sugar.<br> I'll go get the sugar.<br> Marianne, business trip has come up<br> for this weekend.<br> I won't be coming home.<br> Afternoon, sir.<br> You just missed Mrs. Byron.<br> That so?<br> Marianne, business trip has come up<br> for this weekend.<br> I won't be coming home.<br> No wonder cheating is so popular.<br> - Do they let the feeling last?<br> - Who's they?<br> I don't know.

I'm not going to<br> ask anything of your time, or of you.<br> - I'm perfectly willing to go this alone.<br> - Isn't there something in between?<br> I love the way you smell.<br> Like a man.<br> Jeffrey smells like soap.<br> The only thing him and me got in<br> common is you.<br> Haven't seen this kind of splendor<br> since "Bambi".<br> I'd rather look at you.<br> - Is this some kind of mother thing?<br> - Mother would never approve of this.<br> My daughter's about your age.<br> Well, a few years younger maybe.<br> - She's the reason we came to Montreal.<br> - From England?<br> No, not from England.<br> - She's beautiful, I'm sure.<br> - Yes.<br> Young and beautiful, like you.<br> Just a kid, like you.<br> I'm not a kid.<br> A kid wouldn't know how to handle you.<br> Entertaining a new client, laddie?<br> Ornay.<br> May I introduce, Monica Bloom,<br> my research associate.<br> And you certainly do look familiar.<br> I have been know to be,<br> from time to time.<br> - Bernard Ornay, meet Phyllis...<br> - Hart, I'm his mistress.<br> - He must be lucky.<br> - I find him very different from Lucky.<br> - So?<br> - So?<br> - Dinner at 8?<br> - A pleasure.<br> Did I mention?<br> Separate rooms.<br> See you in a few days,<br> don't way up.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Byron.<br> Mr. Byron isn't home as yet.<br> - Did the handy-man come back?<br> - No. Are you expecting him this evening?<br> - I suppose not. "Good evening".<br> - "Good evening, Madam".<br> Jack Dana and Dirk O'Brien were in it.<br> It was a stupid film.<br> The director was bad.<br> He hadn't a clue about acting.<br> And Jack was very serious about<br> this work.<br> I was always trying to soothe him.<br> He had the most terrible temper.<br> And on the last day, Jack and<br> the director has this huge row.<br> And the director, just like that,<br> cut us out of the big scene...<br> ...and gave all our lines to other<br> actors.<br> I couldn't believe it. Jack and I<br> ended up in Dirk's dressing room.<br> And we got completely blotto.<br> Dirk suggested that we hide during<br> lunch, in the closet, on the set.<br> And when they came back and did the<br> scene...<br> ...we would open the closet door<br> and deliver our last lines.<br> But we were in that bloody closet for<br> about an hour before anyone came back...<br> And we were drunk...<br> And... Jack was my pal.<br> And he was very attractive.<br> My husband was in the navy at the time.<br> And I got pregnant in that closet.<br> Well, tha's it. That's the story.<br> The most unbelievable coming-out-of-<br> the-closet story I've ever heard.<br> - How about you, laddie?<br> - Well, I've heard two this weekend.<br> This is by far the more compelling.<br> True confessions again, I'm afraid.<br> Better send me to bed with no pudding.<br> I have exactly the opposite in mind.<br> I want to dance.<br> Somebody dance with me.<br> So, what did your husband say when<br> he found out?<br> - He didn't.<br> - He didn't?<br> Not then.<br> I waited 15 years to tell him.<br> I thought we were safe,<br> we had a good marriage.<br> We had fun, we used to go dancing.<br> We were in love, for God sakes.<br> We had rows of course, but who doesn't?<br> We made sense to each other.<br> And I thought I could tell him<br> in a way he'd be able to handle.<br> I thought we were safe.<br> I thought we were that safe thing<br> called family.<br> It was all right, at first.<br> We were both calm.<br> And then... he lost his mind.<br> He started screaming...<br> She's not mine!<br> And she heard him.<br> He didn't mean it. He loved her more<br> than anything on earth.<br> But she heard him.<br> It must have broken her heart.<br> We lost it all.<br> Jack Dana never did know.<br> - So you had the child?<br> - Of course I had the child.<br> Of course I did.<br> "Fascinating!"<br> Bernard?<br> Come and dance with me.<br> No, no. I want to tell Miss Hart<br> about my own acting fantasies.<br> Why don't you dance with Monica,<br> laddie?<br> Sorry, Horny.<br> Well, who needs a partner to dance?<br> All of a sudden, I feel like<br> Scarlet O'Hara.<br> I duly regret I must take my leave.<br> Don't stand, gentlemen.<br> The pleasure has been all mine.<br> When they said you were good<br> at putting people together laddie...<br> ...I didn't realize just how good.<br> If you call me laddie one more time,<br> after you pay for dinner...<br> ...your next drink will be from<br> the lake.<br> I've paid for nothing yet.<br> Nothing is signed.<br> And if you continue on like this<br> quite probably I won't.<br> That's waht drives a lemming like you,<br> isn't it? The probability of things.<br> Very boring predictability.<br> Corporate takeovers, bimbo girlfriends,<br> fertility cycles.<br> You fool!<br> For a king, Horny, for a true king,<br> the impossible is far more rewarding...<br> ...than the probable!<br> Take a flying leap into the future!<br> See what the hell is out there!<br> She's always saying that.<br> Take a flying leap into the future,<br> Horny!<br> Aw! Jesus, fuck!<br> Hi. Look, I'm sorry, it's late.<br> You want to go somewhere?<br> Have a quiet beer?<br> Ough!<br> - Thank you.<br> - For what?<br> - For going bowling.<br> - Anything's possible.<br> - No, it's too late for most things.<br> - Why?<br> - Other people, for openers.<br> - Your only reason?<br> I wouldn't know how.<br> They say it's just a matter of too much<br> or too little.<br> "Just two seconds and I'll be..."<br> Go away.<br> - Who is that?<br> - Room service.<br> Pudding in bed.<br> You're not going to deny that urge,<br> are you?<br> What?<br> My sweet tooth?<br> No. Mine.<br> I want to know more of you.<br> What does that mean wanting to know<br> you?<br> - Beats me.<br> - Why don't you ask me?<br> Why would I ask you anything, laddie?<br> Please!<br> - The choice seems to be yours.<br> - Lf only that were true.<br> But lovely of you think so,<br> thanks ever so much.<br> Perhaps another time.<br> I have some phone calls I have<br> to make in the morning.<br> We leave around noon,<br> is that all right?<br> I'm in no hurry.<br> It's all right.<br> It's okay.<br> A clever ruse, that's all it is.<br> Sexuality.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Not just us, everyone.<br> Oh, them.<br> I mean, what is wrong with sexual<br> modesty? Tell me that.<br> You mean, exercising restraint?<br> - Well, it's good and it's bad.<br> - Right. It's good and it's bad.<br> - The eternal marriage.<br> - Marriage. You mean happy ever after.<br> I want a divorce.<br> - I want a divorce.<br> - We are not married.<br> If a woman is loved and treated well<br> life can be quite simple.<br> But, if necessary, she is just as<br> capable of living like a man.<br> Why would you wnat to do something<br> like that?<br> Most marriages don't work out anyway.<br> - Do I look like an explorer?<br> - An explorer?<br> Let's see. To be an explorer you have<br> to put your hands on your hips.<br> To be a man stick your chest out.<br> Act cocky.<br> You know?<br> I think women should stay women.<br> You know, completely women.<br> - Uniquely women.<br> - What about children, Lucky?<br> When Phyl sat me down and told me that<br> I wasn't the father of my daughter...<br> ...I just sat there in shock.<br> I was numb.<br> What a betrayal.<br> So I just got up and said that I needed<br> to think it over and needed some time.<br> And I went down to a bar.<br> I sat down at the bar and had a couple<br> of drinks, and it just started cooking.<br> How the tell could she do this to me?<br> To Cassie, for Christ's sake?<br> I got so pissed off I went back to the<br> house and I'm just sreaming at her.<br> I'm yelling, throwing things.<br> I said, "we don't have a child together.<br> You have a child, not me."<br> You, selfish sonovabitch!<br> She ain't mine, goddamit!<br> I think that's what Cassie heard.<br> In the morning, I went down<br> to the room, she was gone.<br> A couple of weeks went by.<br> We got a letter.<br> It was from here, Montreal.<br> She said that she never wanted to see<br> us again.<br> We weren't fit to be her parents.<br> It just killed Phyllis.<br> God, it just killed her.<br> She wanted to come here, to find Cassie.<br> So I sold the house, we moved.<br> Phyl still thinks she sees her now<br> and then, but it's been 8 years.<br> I've given up.<br> Every once in a while I catch myself<br> searching the faces.<br> I don't know if I really want do find<br> her.<br> Because I don't know how I'd feel.<br> - Can I buy you a drink, at least?<br> - What a great mind you have!<br> Here?<br> I'll have gin and tonic.<br> Get off him!<br> Leave him alone!<br> Leave him alone, Jeffrey!<br> - Take him!<br> - Leave him. Stop it!<br> I want to talk to that man!<br> - I want to talk to that man!<br> - I'm right outside!<br> - She's with me.<br> - Take it easy. Take it easy.<br> - What he's been doing with my wife?<br> - What?<br> - I'm not going to cause any trouble.<br> - You wouldn't understand even...<br> if I told you, Jeffrey!<br> Tell them to be careful with that guy.<br> He's cute.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Oh! I'm with him.<br> - You're with my husband.<br> - I am really sorry...<br> Why don't we all meet at your place?<br> I think everybody knows where that is.<br> - All right.<br> - Now walk away.<br> My truck's up that way.<br> What did you do with my car?<br> Get out of the way!<br> - How did you meet my husband?<br> - Rather he met me.<br> - Did you sleep with him?<br> - Sleep with him? No.<br> - I didn't sleep with him.<br> - Frigid, isn't he?<br> Frigid?<br> Tell me, is it true what they say<br> about the laboring classes?<br> I mean, did he give you everything<br> you need?<br> - He's the most sexual man I've ever met.<br> - Really?<br> How many men have you met?<br> Two.<br> "Good morning, Pedro."<br> Excuse the mess. I'm doing a little<br> remodeling.<br> - That's how we met.<br> - Wonderful!<br> - Would you like something to drink?<br> - Gin.<br> - I'll make some coffee, too.<br> - Yes. That'd be good.<br> This is my favorite. We're still in the<br> process of making it into a baby's room.<br> - We?<br> - Yeah, he's been helping me.<br> - Are you pregnant?<br> - I won't know for a few days...<br> ...but I have that feeling.<br> - Bully for you.<br> - And you? Any children?<br> A daughter.<br> - Does she live here?<br> - Visiting.<br> So... Do you know who the father is?<br> Well, he's a lucky man.<br> I'll have to leave now.<br> This has suddenly become...<br> ...a little crazy.<br> It's funny you would say that.<br> Mr. Byron, good evening.<br> It's a beautiful ev...<br> Your car.<br> Could I get...<br> - Have you told him?<br> - No, he knows nothing.<br> Just be sure you tell him.<br> Mr. Byron, Mrs. Byron and another<br> woman have just arrived.<br> Sir, that's far too fast.<br> This is a residential area.<br> I could make you another one.<br> You know what?<br> I'm starting to enjoy myself.<br> No, I really am.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - You, fucking bastard!<br> - Ough!<br> - Get out from in front of the door.<br> - You!
