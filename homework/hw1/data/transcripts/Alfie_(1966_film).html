                        Youre lucky, you know.<br> l rarely allow anyone into my flat.<br> I know, I know, I know.<br> Humble digs.<br> Not exactly what youd call<br> a "panty peeler."<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> But it suits me just fine.<br> To be honest, I rarely spend a night<br> in my own bed anyway.<br> You see, heres my theory:<br> For most women, if a guys<br> a good provider<br> and generally a nice chap, six-pack<br> abs really arent a deal-breaker.<br> On the flip side, however,<br> even though the PC boyfriend<br> sat next to you<br> with his arm slung around<br> your shoulder will deny it...<br> And he will deny it. For us boys,<br> its all about F.B.B.<br> Face. Boobs. Bum.<br> Im just being honest.<br> Its been said that clothes<br> speak the international language.<br> And I have to admit,<br> Im a bit of a fashion whore.<br> Unfortunately, today Ive got work,<br> and I have to tone it down a little bit,<br> but thats all right. Gucci.<br> End-of-summer sale.<br> Very understated.<br> And I can easily spice it up with...<br> What? No, no. I know<br> what you are thinking.<br> If you ooze masculinity,<br> like some of us do,<br> you have no reason to fear pink.<br> Smashing.<br> Now, in the cologne department,<br> most men overdo it.<br> Americans practically spray it on<br> with a crop-duster.<br> My rule: Nothing above the neck,<br> though I do like a little splash<br> on Big Ben.<br> You never know<br> where the day may take you.<br> Almost forgot.<br> New word for the day.<br> Ostentatious: The attempt<br> to attract attention to oneself. <br> Who? Me?<br> Oh, blimey. Im so rude.<br> I havent introduced myself.<br> - Im...<br> - Alfie?<br> There you go. Alfie.<br> Are you the little elf that left these<br> mocha bonbons on my doorstep?<br> No, no, no. You must have<br> a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.<br> You are such a doll, Alfie.<br> But Im supposed to be on a diet.<br> Oh, on a diet?<br> - A diet.<br> - You?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Now, I dont mean to be forward, Lu,<br> but you should know by now<br> that a full-figured girl like yourself<br> - is every guys secret fantasy.<br> - Stop it.<br> So shes a tub of lard.<br> The ships already sailed,<br> so why not make her<br> feel good about herself, right?<br> - Oh, Lu?<br> - Yes, angel?<br> Im working the night spot,<br> and my apartment is a horror show,<br> so Im sorry if I keep you up<br> - with the dust-busting at 2 a. m.<br> - Oh, dont you worry.<br> - Ill give it a quick straighten.<br> - Oh, no, no, you dont need to that.<br> Nonsense.<br> I like doing things for you, Alfie.<br> Im a blessed man<br> having you in my life.<br> Thank you.<br> Keys are in the usual spot.<br> Now, back home, youre always<br> hearing tales about some bloke<br> migrating to the States and winding<br> up with buckets of money.<br> So not long ago, l packed up<br> my bucket and headed west.<br> Now, I must admit,<br> I had a second motive.<br> Id always been told that the most<br> beautiful women in the world...<br> ...resided in Manhattan.<br> And when it comes to shagging birds,<br> its all about one thing:<br> Location, location, location.<br> God, l love this city.<br> All right, girls.<br> Just look around. l mean,<br> every one of them, unique, special,<br> like snowflakes.<br> And with such a plethora...<br> Calendar word meaning "abundance,"<br> of gorgeousness and diversity,<br> well, how could a man ever choose<br> to settle down with just one?<br> I myself subscribe more<br> to the European philosophy of life.<br> My priorities leaning towards<br> wine, women...<br> Well, actually, thats about it.<br> Wine and women.<br> Although, women and women<br> is always a fun option.<br> So...<br> ...to live life to the fullest,<br> I require only enough<br> to cover my modest expenses.<br> Ive no desire to be the richest stiff<br> in the cemetery.<br> I think this might just be my<br> favourite position.<br> I know it was President Kennedys.<br> He was such a great leader.<br> Of course, JFK used the old<br> bad-back excuse,<br> but if you ask me, he knew<br> it gave you maximum pleasure<br> with minimum exertion.<br> What is it about the back of a limo?<br> Obligatory cuddling.<br> Thousand one,<br> thousand two...<br> Cripes. Hey, Ive gotta get cracking.<br> Ive got a 10:00 pickup.<br> You better hurry up.<br> You dont want to keep her waiting.<br> Quite the number, isnt she?<br> Yet, she tells me her old man<br> hasnt shagged her in six months.<br> Six months. I mean, thank God<br> there are gentlemen like me around<br> to pick up the slack.<br> Just look at her.<br> Legs like a racehorse.<br> Perfect yoga bum. I give her<br> my highest grade:<br> A-minus.<br> Where did we tell the old man<br> we were going tonight?<br> - A movie.<br> - Treasure, please, no, no, no.<br> Stop messing about.<br> Youll ruin my presets.<br> - Sorry.<br> - What movie?<br> I dont know. Whats the difference?<br> The difference is, the more detail<br> you give, the less interested hell be.<br> It wouldnt matter what I said.<br> It would never occur to Phil<br> that another man<br> - would ever look twice at me.<br> - Dor, darling,<br> you fishing for a compliment?<br> No.<br> You should know by now they only<br> come from me when least expected.<br> Now, come and have a mint so Phil<br> doesnt smell the Alfie on your breath.<br> I dont care if he does.<br> Theres one thing that puts me<br> off marriage: Its married women.<br> Dorie doesnt know it yet,<br> but you wont be seeing<br> much more of her.<br> Ive got that all-too-familiar feeling.<br> Sooner or later, shell be wanting<br> a little bit more than Im able to give.<br> Wouldnt it be great if I was<br> going home with you tonight<br> instead of Phil the Pill?<br> Yeah.<br> lts definitely time<br> to stage a disappearing act.<br> So next Tuesday,<br> same time, same place?<br> Im sorry, love, its Fashion Week.<br> Im booked double shifts.<br> - Ill call you the instant things let up.<br> - Okay.<br> In the meantime, I left you<br> a little souvenir to remember me by.<br> Oh, Dor?<br> Your derrire looks really rather<br> ravishing from this vantage point.<br> See?<br> A compliment when least expected.<br> What can I say?<br> Happy as a pup with two tails.<br> And I think Ive done old Phil<br> a bit of a favour too.<br> Of course, hed be the last to see it.<br> Never expect any thanks in this life.<br> You know what I mean?<br> So Tuesday...<br> ...10:03 p.m.<br> Do I drag myself home<br> to a cold flat, empty fridge,<br> or nip across town for a hot bath,<br> warm body, breakfast in bed?<br> Decisions, decisions...<br> Yeah, l think lll pay a visit<br> to my semi-regular,<br> quasi, sort of girlfriend.<br> My sweet Julie.<br> Let me guess.<br> Unexpected last-minute fare.<br> Yeah. She had me going<br> up and down for hours.<br> That supposed to be funny?<br> Because it is so very...<br> Not.<br> Hey!<br> Im not kidding, Alfie!<br> Im not kidding. I hate you sometimes.<br> You have a very ostentatious way<br> of showing it.<br> Yeah, I sure do.<br> No, darling. Can we hit pause?<br> I just need a second to unwind.<br> Oh, I nicked half a bottle<br> of Stoli from the limo.<br> How do you want yours,<br> on the rocks?<br> I just want my usual, Alfie. Straight up.<br> No, Im so totally knackered.<br> Ill make it up to you in the morning.<br> Cross my heart.<br> But tonight, all Im good for<br> is a bite to eat, hot bath<br> and a nice long sleep.<br> You know, this isnt<br> a Holiday Inn, Alfie.<br> Whats that again?<br> Where were you tonight? Really?<br> Youve got to open a restaurant.<br> Thats seriously delicious.<br> Thanks, Alfie. Its just chilli.<br> Hey.<br> A little eye contact, please.<br> We have something here,<br> or am I just a glorified booty call?<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> Heres what shes really saying:<br> She wants me to commit.<br> Translation: Become domestified. <br> Now, it doesnt do to become<br> dependent on anybody in this life.<br> Change your nature,<br> youre a dead man.<br> Chilli, please.<br> Dont get me wrong.<br> Shes adorable.<br> Cute? Absolutely.<br> But is it ever enough?<br> I told you how we men are.<br> We want showstoppers.<br> And the problem is,<br> Julie hasnt got enough<br> of the superficial things<br> that really matter.<br> - I dont deserve you.<br> - Yeah, thats probably true.<br> Too bad I love you.<br> Thanks, babe.<br> - Alfie, Alfie...<br> - What?<br> Youre giving me the "Thanks, babe."<br> Youre giving me the "Thanks, baby."<br> - Calm down.<br> - Dont tell me to calm down!<br> - I know how you feel!<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Youre gonna wake up...<br> - Max.<br> Hey, little man. Did we wake you up?<br> Yes.<br> Now, lads, learn from my mistake.<br> Never get involved<br> with a single mum.<br> See, they come with accessories,<br> some of which can be...<br> ...unfortunately, irresistible.<br> Sights like that make you realize<br> we all have an expiration date.<br> And women do have a shorter<br> shelf life than men, dont they?<br> I think thats what Julie<br> was banging on about yesterday.<br> Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur.<br> This is where I make<br> my reasonably honest living.<br> Standards of elegance has taken<br> quite a pounding, wouldnt you say?<br> I know. Believe me,<br> its merely a stepping stone.<br> Currently parked on one<br> of those stepping stones<br> is my best mate and future<br> business partner, Marlon.<br> Black. Like Lonettes skin...<br> ...which I will never again touch.<br> Im afraid youre not meeting<br> my man on top form.<br> See, Marlons got a problem.<br> lts called Lonette.<br> And very recently, it dumped him.<br> Oh, dear. Come on,<br> what was it this time?<br> Three a. m. begging, at her front door.<br> - Level of inebriation?<br> - Vomiting.<br> Right. So let me get this straight.<br> You were at her front door,<br> begging and vomiting?<br> And what,<br> she wasnt charmed by that?<br> Alfie? Why is there no Stoli<br> in car number two?<br> Ive no idea.<br> I gotta watch this guy like a hawk.<br> That little chaps name is Wing.<br> My boss and owner<br> of this tragic enterprise.<br> - Wipe that car good.<br> - Owner, that is, till me and Marlon<br> swing a loan and buy it out<br> from underneath his scrawny...<br> Hello. You miss bird shit.<br> Wing.<br> Hes barking mad.<br> Check out the way he talks<br> to the little woman.<br> Shes given him her best years,<br> cooked his chop suey,<br> helped with the business, and I bet<br> at one time he couldnt wait<br> to rip off her kimono.<br> And now look at him.<br> And Im supposed to respect<br> the institution of marriage?<br> Thats a great figure, man.<br> We swing that loan,<br> cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...<br> Were gonna take Wing<br> by surprise with an offer like this.<br> I couldve predicted this. See,<br> Marlon and Lonette have reached<br> that critical 18-month Where are<br> we going, what are we doing,<br> whats happening here? crisis point<br> that rears its ugly head<br> in every relationship.<br> Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.<br> Marlon wanted another 18 months<br> to make sure nothing better<br> was coming his way.<br> I fucked up egregiously.<br> I see youre making the most<br> of that birthday calendar.<br> By the time he realized hed made<br> a mistake and he wanted her back...<br> - ... it was too late.<br> - Hey, stranger.<br> Hey.<br> Carol.<br> - Carol.

You be well.<br> Whats up with that?<br> Put it this way, the show closed<br> after one performance only.<br> - Do I even wanna know why?<br> - No. Come on,<br> it would be less than discreet<br> to tell you why.<br> Hair on the arms.

Maybe it was time<br> to stoke the home fires.<br> Anybody in the mood<br> for a little Alfie, straight up?<br> Oh, this isnt a good time, Alfie.<br> Got a lot on my mind.<br> Oh, God. Yeah, I really hate<br> when that happens.<br> Open up, baby.<br> You look seriously beautiful.<br> - Not tonight, Alfred.<br> - Whats the matter? Tell me.<br> I dont...

I dont remember.<br> - Dude, you did something to her.<br> - No.<br> Oh, yeah, you did.<br> Because she shows up at my house,<br> at 4 in the morning,<br> saying that she wanted me back.<br> She even said<br> that if I needed more time,<br> that she understood completely.<br> How fucking crazy.<br> Chalk one up for the blokes.<br> Thanks to me, Marlon won the game.<br> Which means hes off scot-free,<br> and so am I.<br> This is a bloody miracle.<br> Thats fantastic. Fantastic.<br> - Come on, what did you say to her?<br> - Look, look.<br> - Its all good.<br> - Come on, what did you say?<br> I asked her to marry me.<br> You know youre my best man, right?<br> Moral of the story:<br> No good deed goes unpunished.<br> New word for the day?<br> Resilience:<br> The ability to readily recover<br> after disappointment or loss. <br> Capacity to spring back.<br> Understand, its not<br> about replacing Julie.<br> l just wanna get back<br> to the simple life:<br> Women who mean nothing to me.<br> So lve struck up a friendship<br> with a nightclub hostess called Uta.<br> Hello, Uta.<br> Now, as a heat-seeking bachelor,<br> I have to live<br> by some very simple rules.<br> Alfie Elkins credo or philosophy,<br> which is probably best summed up<br> by the only advice<br> my father ever gave me.<br> He said, Son, whenever you<br> meet a beautiful woman...<br> ...just remember, somewhere theres<br> a bloke whos sick of shagging her. <br> - Can I help you, man?<br> - G and T, please.<br> Explain to me what everyone sees<br> in that Eurotrash?<br> I think its incredibly unfair<br> that its acceptable for men<br> to be sexually experimental,<br> then with a woman,<br> if she wants to try something...<br> A kiss or a threesome.<br> You know, that theyd be judged.<br> I wouldnt judge them.<br> And I think if you two were to kiss,<br> I would... I would just...<br> I would just see it<br> as a thing of beauty.<br> Although lm living every guys<br> Rat Pack fantasy,<br> something feels a bit off.<br> And throwing myself<br> back into the old lifestyle<br> isnt going quite as smoothly<br> as ld hoped.<br> Sorry.<br> Im sorry.<br> You carry on without me.<br> Oh, my loves, I...<br> I dont know what happened.<br> This is so unlike me.<br> Yeah, you... You two just...<br> l used to think<br> there was nothing worse than death.<br> Then, from out of nowhere...<br> ...the unthinkable.<br> Now I really dont get<br> what everyone sees in you.<br> It just keeps on happening<br> and happening.<br> Or more accurately, not happening<br> and not happening.<br> This never happens, Uta.<br> Honestly, never.<br> Honestly.<br> Not the word around town...<br> ...peewee.<br> Mr Elkins? Miranda Kulp.<br> Miranda.<br> The penis doctor is a he<br> with a little bit of she thrown in.<br> So I understand youre experiencing<br> some erectile dysfunction.<br> I am experiencing a little... A little...<br> A little bit of... What you just said.<br> Not to worry.<br> Thats my area of expertise.<br> So have you been under any unusual<br> emotional stress lately, Mr Elkins?<br> Stress? Emotional? Me? No, never.<br> Well, unless you count<br> that recent chat I had with Julie.<br> I cant see you anymore, Alfie.<br> - Why? You angry?<br> - No, Im really not angry.<br> Just, you know,<br> we want different things.<br> And I cant have you traipsing<br> in and out of Maxs life.<br> Youve changed your hair,<br> havent you?<br> You have, havent you?<br> No, you have.<br> Youve changed your hairdo.<br> You cut it?<br> It looks gorgeous.<br> - Thanks.<br> - How come...?<br> How come you never had it like that<br> when we were together?<br> I really gotta go.<br> Well, I guess...<br> ...you need these back.<br> Thank you.<br> Alfie?<br> You gonna be okay?<br> Yeah. No worries.

Maam.<br> Now that, my friends,<br> is a real woman.<br> Smart and sexy and...<br> You noticed the little flirt<br> going on between us, huh?<br> Makes me think,<br> if a woman like that,<br> of that calibre<br> should take notice<br> of a bloke like me,<br> then, perhaps...<br> Perhaps Im selling myself<br> a bit short.<br> ln a flash,<br> l have my New Years resolution.<br> Aim higher.<br> Catastrophic. Doomed.<br> Desolate. Cataclysmic.<br> Bought him a word-of-the-day<br> calendar for Christmas.<br> Big mistake.<br> Holiday season,<br> busiest time of the year.<br> I try to run a business.<br> - Whats the problem, Mr Wing?<br> - Your soul brother.<br> He quit.<br> ln the letter Marlon left me,<br> he called me his best friend...<br> ...but apologized for bailing<br> on our business scheme.<br> He said his whole thing now<br> was to make Lonette happy.<br> They decided,<br> on the spur of the moment,<br> to move upstate,<br> and l had a standing<br> invite to drop by any time.<br> Somehow Lonette<br> convinced Marlon<br> it would be too painful<br> to say our goodbyes in person.<br> And to make matters worse,<br> it all dovetails into<br> the second loneliest night of the year:<br> Christmas Eve.<br> A night that brings on all those<br> familiar festive feelings<br> of hopelessness,<br> anguish, despair.<br> Not a great time to be flying solo.<br> Thats why Im of the belief<br> couples should never split up<br> between Thanksgiving<br> and January 2nd.<br> Always have a relationship to see<br> you through the holidays. Always.<br> The downside, of course, being gifts.<br> Personally, Ive always<br> suspected that everyone else<br> is having a far merrier<br> Christmas than I am.<br> Not that Ive ever actually<br> had a Christmas.<br> Thats a whole other Dickens story.<br> Taxi.<br> Excuse me.<br> Im sorry, mate, its against the law<br> for me to carry any more than...<br> Thank the Lord.<br> A Christmas miracle.<br> All right, hop in.<br> Thanks for saving us.<br> I was freezing my little tush off.<br> No worries. You know,<br> its pretty full back there.<br> - Why dont you...<br> - Good idea.<br> Why dont I?<br> Hey, watch the champagne.<br> All in.<br> - They dont get out much.<br> - You wanna watch out, you guys.<br> Youll end up with a lump of coal<br> in your stocking.<br> Youre English.<br> I love English.<br> - Whats your name?<br> - Alfie.<br> You wanna abuse<br> a little substance, Alfie?<br> No, thanks. Im trying to quit.<br> All right. One hit.<br> Merry Christmastime<br> Theres an expression<br> the Yanks use, Go with the flow. <br> So, yeah, I got a dose<br> of the holiday blues.<br> But when a girl of this mind-blowing<br> calibre invites you to a party,<br> its time to get going<br> and start flowing.<br> Maybe its the late hour.<br> Maybe its the heavily<br> spiked eggnog.<br> Maybe it was simply<br> a mutual desperate desire<br> to have ourselves<br> a merry little Christmas.<br> Whatever the reason, hooking up<br> has never gone more swimmingly,<br> and l find myself saying<br> something highly out of character:<br> Im renovating my apartment<br> on the Upper West Side.<br> But, say, you could...<br> ...crash at my sublet,<br> if you want.<br> See you through the holidays.<br> That sounds inviting.<br> And so it came to pass,<br> that after all those years,<br> little Alfred finally got<br> what he wanted for Christmas.<br> The 12 days of Christmas<br> were flying by<br> at a surrealistic pace.<br> Yeah, its been quite the ride.<br> The package was irresistible.<br> A showstopper with<br> a new-school brand of sexiness.<br> Who wouldnt get off on the way<br> she makes heads turn?<br> Plus, we have so much in common.<br> - Shes sweet, fun, original, exciting,<br> - Adore you.<br> full of surprises.<br> Oh, and did l mention,<br> she makes a cracking good bed.<br> l began to wonder,<br> could this be the one...<br> ...who finally holds my attention?<br> Happy New Year!<br> ln every doomed relationship,<br> there comes what l like to call<br> the uh-oh moment. <br> When a certain little<br> something happens,<br> and you know youve just witnessed<br> the beginning of the end.<br> And suddenly you stop<br> and you think:<br> Uh-oh, iceberg ahead. <br> With Nikki, that was<br> the first of many...<br> ...uh-oh moments.<br> lt began with petty arguments.<br> Followed by random bouts<br> of melancholia.<br> Major highs and manic lows.<br> This girl never knows<br> when shes had one too many.<br> And there had been constant displays<br> of erratic, reckless behaviour.<br> And thank you, no.<br> No, l did not have insurance.<br> But whenever l begin to feel<br> theres little reason to go on,<br> lm reminded that we still have<br> one very major thing in common.<br> lf only she didnt insist<br> on smoking before,<br> after<br> and during.<br> What time are you gonna<br> be home, honey?<br> Hear that?<br> What time are you gonna<br> be home, honey? <br> Thats dangerously close<br> to wife-speak to me.<br> Because Im making something<br> really special for din-din.<br> Din-din?<br> Ill call later.<br> Listen, are you sure you dont<br> think that colours a little bit intense?<br> - I think youre a little bit intense.<br> - Careful,<br> because youve got paint<br> all over your hands.<br> Plus, youre wearing my favourite shirt<br> to paint the house in, Nik. Dont...<br> Sorry, baby.<br> I gotta run.<br> No, Ive gotta run.<br> I bet that I can make it<br> worth your while to stay.<br> Im sure you can. But you know what?<br> Ive got that meeting.<br> - Havent I?<br> - Yeah.<br> You know youre in trouble when<br> a sight like that cant keep you planted.<br> When I was a boy<br> at St. Albans Secondary School,<br> the school took us<br> on this cultural trip<br> to observe art at one of the...<br> One of those big famous<br> London museums.<br> Anyway, when I was there,<br> I came across this statue<br> of a Greek goddess in marble.<br> Aphrodi... Aphrodite,<br> something like that.<br> Beautiful, she was.<br> Perfect female form.<br> Chiselled features.<br> Exquisite.<br> I stood in awe of her.<br> Finally, the teacher calls us<br> all over, and Im walking past it,<br> and on the way I notice,<br> in the side of this Greek goddess,<br> all these cracks,<br> chips, imperfections.<br> Ruined her for me.<br> Well, thats Nikki.<br> A beautiful sculpture...<br> ...damaged...<br> ...in a way you dont notice<br> till you get too close.<br> I lost the signal for a second there.<br> But I dont know.<br> Its just a lot of personal stuff<br> going on.<br> You know what I mean?<br> - Oh, I know.<br> - Welcome, Mr Alfie.<br> Good to see you, Elvis. Look, I hope<br> you dont mind me rambling on.<br> - Enjoy your evening, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> As you can see, the lads<br> moving up in the world.<br> Its just that Ive got<br> this friend whos,<br> lets say, outstayed his welcome.<br> Absolutely right.<br> Its a lot tougher getting them out<br> than getting them in. I like that.<br> Youll never guess<br> who Im dropping in on now.<br> I wouldnt have believed it myself<br> a couple of weeks ago.<br> Why dont you just try being honest,<br> and tell your friend that the hotel<br> is under new management<br> and that they have to vacate<br> the premises. You know what I mean.<br> That kimono<br> does wonders for your dcolletage.<br> - Big word.<br> - Big dcolletage.<br> Why dont we have a drink and you<br> can tell me the rest of your troubles.<br> Instead of me listening to hers.<br> Thats a change.<br> You know, for someone<br> so very young, youre terribly wise.<br> Secret admirer?<br> One of many.<br> You would never think of bringing<br> a girl flowers, would you, Alfie?<br> It would only encourage them.<br> Im gonna make us that drink.<br> Whats your poison, sweetheart?<br> Ill have a spot of whiskey, please.<br> Midleton Rare, if youve got it.<br> I like dropping a fancy brand name<br> in now and again,<br> let her know she aint<br> the only one been around.<br> Why not make this<br> an absinthe afternoon?<br> Brilliant.<br> - No idea what shes talking about.<br> - Youve had absinthe?<br> Not recently, no.<br> Remind me, what is it again?<br> The Green Fairy. The French<br> impressionists liquid drug of choice.<br> And I got you some of those<br> little egg thingies you like so much.<br> I mention I like something once,<br> next thing I know,<br> I get it on a silver platter.<br> Perfect, huh?<br> Kind of pad I plan<br> to earn myself one day.<br> Understated elegance<br> with just a touch of the trendy.<br> Shes a regular fashionista.<br> You dont have to tell this one<br> which slingbacks go with which frock.<br> Owns her own cosmetics company.<br> Empire, actually.<br> Started out doing facials<br> in a fancy salon.<br> Took a handful of mud,<br> mixed it with a dash of papaya,<br> put it on the market,<br> and bingo: All this.<br> This stuff is so illegal.<br> I smuggled a whole batch<br> of it back from Prague<br> in Listerine bottles.<br> Oh, I checked out<br> your business plan.<br> - And?<br> - Im impressed.<br> - You seem surprised.<br> - Not at all.<br> Because underneath<br> all that bravado<br> beats the heart of a guy whos a lot<br> smarter than he thinks he is,<br> but not nearly as cocky as hed like<br> everybody else to believe.<br> What are we...?<br> What exactly are we basing this on?<br> This insight into my personality?<br> That it takes one to know one.<br> What?<br> I was just wondering if theres<br> a clever little tattoo artist out there<br> who could change Pablo into Alfie. <br> Heres to clever little tattoo artists.<br> Jesus.<br> It made me feel<br> all warm going down.<br> Thats my job.<br> You know what they say.<br> What do they say?<br> Absinthe makes<br> the heart grow fonder.<br> Oh, great.<br> Check this out.<br> Have a look at the size of this tub.<br> Shes had two husbands,<br> both croaked,<br> and I have a feeling<br> this was the scene of the crime.<br> Come on, baby, lets get wet.<br> If she keeps this up,<br> were gonna be updating that tattoo<br> of hers a lot sooner than she thinks.<br> Remember how little Alfred finally got<br> what he wanted for Christmas?<br> Be careful what you wish for.<br> Theres something else.<br> Dozed off?<br> Yeah.<br> I tried waiting up for you.<br> - Your meeting ran late, huh?<br> - Very.

It looks brilliant.<br> Really smashing.<br> - So, Nik...<br> - Alfie, Ive been thinking.<br> Will you look at these<br> cute little potatoes?<br> Okay. I know I have been<br> a real handful lately.<br> I dont know, I think it has to do a lot<br> with me feeling displaced...<br> ...and not totally trusting.<br> Sweetie, cutting to the chase.<br> I am gonna do better.<br> I promise.<br> I am gonna take my medication<br> religiously from now on.<br> And everything, everything<br> is gonna be easy and breezy.<br> Sound good? Honey?<br> So come, come and sit.<br> A feast awaits.<br> I already ate, Nik.<br> Of course.<br> No worries, well have leftovers.<br> I can whip up a little<br> corned beef hash for brunch.<br> Whats the matter, Alfie?<br> Nothing. I just...<br> Ive got a lot on my mind and...<br> - ... Im feeling a bit...<br> - What?<br> Cold? Distant? Remote? What?<br> Oh, Nik, this is a complete drag.<br> Everything happened so quickly.<br> - Im not the best at this sort of thing.<br> - What sort of thing?<br> I...<br> ...dont know exactly how to say it.<br> Sure you do, Alfie.<br> Youve had plenty<br> of experience dumping girls.<br> Dont worry.<br> Im already gone.<br> Strange.<br> But even when you know<br> it has to end...<br> ...when it finally does...<br> ...you always get<br> that inevitable twinge:<br> Have l done the right thing?<br> I must admit...<br> ...I do miss the companionship.<br> Nikki was a showstopper.<br> But as me ugly old Aunt Gladys<br> used to say,<br> Looks arent everything. <br> I used to think that was<br> a load of bollocks,<br> but just lately Ive been thinking...<br> ...maybe the old bat had something.<br> Julie?<br> Alfie, hi.<br> What a surprise.<br> - God, I havent seen you since...<br> - Yeah.<br> You look...

Come on.<br> Come on, just tell me.<br> Just tell me, come on.<br> Whats he got better than me?!<br> Hes younger than you.<br> Hes younger than you. <br> lve gotta admit,<br> l didnt see it coming.<br> She caught me off-guard, all right.<br> You couldnt tell, though, could you?<br> As youve learned by now,<br> Im rather skilled at hiding my feelings.<br> You see, the thing with feelings<br> is they have<br> this quiet way of sneaking up on you<br> when you least expect it.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Yeah.<br> Like with Liz.<br> Who wouldve thought,<br> of all the women Ive known...<br> ...the one I let my guard down with<br> delivers the knockout punch.<br> Ironic.<br> Calendar word.<br> Dorie.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello, Alfie.<br> - I havent seen you in ages.<br> - Maybe because you stopped calling.<br> I know. Things were getting<br> a bit too...<br> Dont bother explaining. Im way past<br> needing excuses.<br> All right. No, you know what?<br> I want to explain.<br> What? You had your fill of me?<br> Someone cuter came along?<br> I dont need to hear it, Alfie.<br> - Look, Dorie...<br> - Really.<br> Look, Dorie...<br> What happens with me is...<br> I dont know, I get...<br> When it gets too... Not close<br> but something like that,<br> I start to feel... Not stifled,<br> not trapped, but something like that.<br> And I... And...<br> You know? You know what I mean?<br> Did that make...?<br> Did that make any sense?<br> I think it has to make sense to you<br> more than me at this point.<br> Yeah, fair enough.<br> I need to go. Hell be waiting for me.<br> Dorie.<br> Im sorry.<br> Good luck, Alfie.<br> I warned them all from<br> the beginning.<br> I always said something along<br> the lines of,<br> I must advise you,<br> I am stamped with an<br> invisible warning.<br> I will not commit. I will never marry. <br> Despite my best efforts, Im beginning<br> to feel some small cracks<br> in my faux finish.<br> You know, when l look back<br> on my little life,<br> and all the women lve known...<br> ...l cant help but think about...<br> ...all that theyve done for me...<br> ...and how little lve done for them.<br> How they looked after me,<br> cared for me...<br> ...and l repaid them by never<br> returning the favour.<br> Yeah.<br> I used to think I had the best end<br> of the deal.<br> What have I got?<br> Really?<br> Some money in my pocket.<br> Some nice threads.<br> Fancy car at my disposal.<br> And Im single.<br> Unattached. Free as a bird.<br> I dont depend on nobody.<br> Nobody depends on me.<br> My lifes my own.<br> But I dont have peace of mind.<br> And if you dont have that,<br> youve got nothing.<br> So...<br> So, whats the answer?<br> Thats what I keep asking myself.<br> Whats it all about?<br> You know what I mean?<br>
