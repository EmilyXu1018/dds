Good luck.<br> Good evening,<br> sports fans across the nation.<br> Liston in the white trunks<br> with the black stripes.<br> Clay, an inch and a half taller, in<br> the white trunks with the red stripes--<br> And Cassius Clay<br> is sidestepping.<br> There it is, champ.<br> Stay on your toes now.<br> And we can see that the champion<br> is the aggressor.<br> There's a shot under the heart.<br> Cassius Clay slips away.<br> And now Clay pounds a left.<br> Another left. A straight jab.<br> It seems to have stunned him.<br> And that's the bell.<br> And they're fighting after the bell.<br> And they're still fighting.<br> This round is over.<br> Break it up, ref.<br> There is no love lost between<br> the two contenders at this time.<br> Cassius goes back to his corner.<br> It's been an amazing round.<br> You can beat this guy.<br> I'm still here.<br> And Sonny Liston<br> is not taking the stool.<br> He's anxious to get back<br> into the challenger's face.<br> Take it to the body.<br> Kill the body, the head will follow.<br> This is a totally different fight<br> than Liston expected...<br> and anyone in this arena<br> will tell you.<br> There's a long, looping left hand.<br> Clay's eyes are wide open now.<br> - Come on, Cass! Move!<br> - Step back.<br> - Come on, Cassius!<br> - Come on, Chi-Chi!<br> I'm not prognosticating<br> anything...<br> but merely his survival<br> to this juncture--<br> Cass, hit him!<br> Break.<br> Let him go.<br> Sonny Liston is hurt.<br> He's bleeding from his eye.<br> He's defying the experts early.<br> We have to take a look at this man and<br> say he is not in awe of the champion.<br> He ain't nothin' to me.<br> And he know it.<br> This is it now.<br> Let me have that, John.<br> And now they're ready.<br> You gonna knock<br> the ugly off of him.<br> That's gonna take a long time,<br> but you can do it.<br> There he is. Get him off.<br> Do your job, ref.<br> Shake him.<br> Do your job, ref.<br> There it is.<br> Come on, ref.<br> Break.<br> - There he is.<br> - Clay slips around and out.<br> Up against the ropes.<br> Right above me now.<br> Too tight. Get in there.<br> My eyes. There's something in my eyes.<br> I can't see nothin'.<br> Come on.<br> - What's going on?<br> - Nothin'.<br> The guy's punchin' on the breaks.<br> Just take care of it. We're fine.<br> I can't see nothin', man.<br> Just go and cut 'em off, Angie.<br> No, no. You can't fight<br> with no gloves on.<br> Just get up. Get up.<br> Try and do it. Come on.<br> I can't see, man.<br> - Come on, Cass!<br> - Dance!<br> Liston crouching,<br> hitting to the body.<br> It's like he's blinking,<br> like he doesn't see Liston.<br> Ref, you gotta do your job.<br> Hold it.<br> Stay away from him, Clay.<br> Stay away from him.<br> The champion, you can see,<br> is the aggressor.<br> - Get him, Cass!<br> - Come on, Cass!<br> - Knock him up!<br> - Clay looks all done.<br> Hold on to him!<br> - Stop it. Stop. Break.<br> - Knock him up.<br> Get on him.<br> Get on him, man.<br> - You can see him now.<br> - You go get him, man.<br> Clay lands a left,<br> but Liston ducked under it...<br> and took it high<br> on the forehead.<br> It's Clay coming on.<br> And Liston backs away.<br> And all the predictions<br> are going down the drain...<br> as Liston is listless.<br> And there's the bell.<br> We're coming up<br> to round seven.<br> Wait a minute!<br> Liston's not coming out.<br> The winner and new heavyweight<br> champion of the world is Cassius Clay.<br> Eat your words!<br> Eat your words!<br> Les, I'm going up into the ring.<br> Get back.<br> I'm the greatest thing<br> ever happened to boxing.<br> Cassius. Cassius.<br> I shook up the world!<br> It's a scene of<br> absolute bedlam in the ring!<br> I am the greatest.<br> I'm a bad man. I shook up the world!<br> Did he ever hurt you?<br> I'm only 22 years old.<br> I ain't got a mark on my face.<br> - I must be the greatest.<br> - And you're pretty.<br> I must be the greatest.<br> Wait.

I know it's a lie.<br> Joe Frazier knows it's a lie.<br> And it's time for everybody<br> to stop lying and tell the truth.<br> Let's tell it like it is.<br> With your court and boxing problems...<br> can you get a fight promoted?<br> I would fight Joe Frazier for free<br> in a phone booth...<br> in the middle of Times Square<br> if I wasn't broke.<br> Did you say you were broke?<br> How can you be broke?<br> You made more money than all previous<br> heavyweights champions combined.<br> What about your management?<br> Surely they have provided for you.<br> All I'm trying to say is it's time<br> for everybody to stop lyin'.<br> Muhammad Ali is the champ.<br> Get my son Herbert<br> on the telephone.<br> Muhammad, thank you for calling in.<br> I'll relay that to Joe.<br> And tell Joe I said<br> he is very ugly.<br> Muhammad says that he will<br> fight you anywhere, anytime...<br> and that the championship really is his<br> until that battle ensues.<br> Mr. Ali has sporting blood.<br> Mr. Ali wants a place<br> in this sports world.<br> He loves it too much.<br> I am therefore suspending Mr. Ali<br> from the practice of Islam.<br> He may no longer appear in temple,<br> pray or teach...<br> or have any conversation<br> with any Muslim whatsoever.<br> Why didn't you call<br> an ambulance or a doctor?<br> Because he gave me your number<br> when he checked in.<br> Normally, he's up there<br> making a lot of noise.<br> But now he hasn't answered the door<br> in three days.<br> - What's that?<br> - It's daylight.<br> Get me that short dog.<br> Give it to me.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Ain't nothin' wrong with me.<br> My head ain't bad.<br> - Leave me alone.<br> - Leave you alone. You called me!<br> Yes, but that was a week ago.<br> - Why are you shamin' yourself?<br> - Let me go, man.<br> Why you doin' that<br> to yourself?<br> - Why you shamin' yourself?<br> - Ain't nobody shamed.<br> Ain't nothin' wrong with me.<br> I'm flyin'.<br> The Sky Chief talk through me.<br> I know the word.<br> - You know low.<br> - Yeah?<br> I know low where the king<br> is goin' back to his throne!<br> - From the root to the fruit!<br> - Them rhymes is old, Bundini.<br> You need to get some new ones.<br> God don't care about you.<br> Don't care about me.<br> In all of everything, we don't mean<br> nothin'. He don't owe us.<br> We be.<br> And that's the onliest thing He did.<br> But that's good.<br> That's why we free.<br> But free ain't easy. Free is real<br> and real is a motherfucker.<br> It eats raw meat.<br> It walk in its own shoes.<br> It don't ever waiver.<br> Yeah.<br> I-- I sold your belt.<br> I sold your belt to a barber<br> for $500 on Lenox Avenue.<br> That's how low I did you.<br> I couldn't help it. I got a crazy mind.<br> That belt say you the heavyweight<br> boxing champion of the world...<br> and I took that $500...<br> and I put it in my arm.<br> That's what I called to tell you.<br> I heard about the Nation stuff,<br> the courtroom.<br> What you gonna do?<br> Take me back.<br> I could go down there and get the belt.<br> I can go get the belt.<br> Hey, champ.<br> $1,000 to the man that bring me<br> Howard Cosell's toupee dead or alive!<br> Don't bother me.<br> I'm a world-famous sportscaster...<br> and you're an ex-champion<br> with diminished skills.<br> I can't be seen with you.<br> - How's it goin', champ?<br> - Pretty good, man.<br> Muhammad, I'd do anything for you.<br> You know that.<br> But I've got bosses who only<br> give a damn about Nielsen ratings.<br> I guarantee...<br> it will be a historical<br> and a momentous night.<br> If they came to me tomorrow and say,<br> "We want you to fight Joe Frazier.<br> Madison Square Garden.<br> Millions and millions of dollars.<br> Here's your license back."<br> I will tell them...<br> "I will never fight again."<br> Frankly, Muhammad, I'm surprised,<br> because unless you--<br> or until you fight Frazier--<br> Cosell, are you losin' your hearing<br> along with your hair?<br> Don't put no question to it, man.<br> I done told you, I'm through fightin'.<br> I got a much bigger contender,<br> a much heavier opponent.<br> I'm fightin'<br> the entire US government.<br> Do you think<br> you're going to jail?<br> I don't know. I don't know.<br> Joe Frazier told me on this show<br> that he could knock you out.<br> See, there you go agitatin'.<br> You should've asked Smokin' Joe<br> what have he been smokin'?<br> That boy even dream he whupped me,<br> he better wake up and apologize.<br> If I was to get in the ring with Joe...<br> here's what you might see.<br> Ali comes out to meet Frazier,<br> but Frazier starts to retreat.<br> If Joe goes back an inch farther,<br> he'll wind up in a ringside seat.<br> Ali swings with his left,<br> Ali swings with his right.<br> Just look at the kid<br> carry the fight.<br> Frazier keeps backin',<br> but there's not enough room.<br> It's only a matter of time<br> before Ali lowers the boom.<br> Ali swings with his right.<br> What a beautiful swing.<br> But the punch lifts Frazier<br> clean out of the ring.<br> Frazier's still risin',<br> and the referee wears a frown...<br> 'cause he can't start countin'<br> till Frazier comes down.<br> Frazier's disappeared from view.<br> The crowd is getting frantic.<br> But our radar stations picked him up.<br> He's somewhere over the Atlantic.<br> Now, who would've thought<br> when they came to the fight...<br> they was gonna witness the launchin'<br> of a black satellite.<br> But don't wait for that fight.<br> It ain't never gonna happen.<br> Only thing you could do...<br> is wonder and imagine.<br> This has been another<br> sports exclusive from ABC.<br> - Two. Go two.<br> - Over to Jim McKay...<br> in Bern, Switzerland.<br> - How you gonna go from me to Jim McKay?<br> - Listen, uh--<br> - Did your wife leave you yet?<br> - No, she hasn't left me yet.<br> She's going to, 'cause I<br> told your wife when I seen her...<br> I said, "Listen, why you<br> doin' this to yourself?"<br> Oh, man, Joe.<br> Who dresses you?<br> You look like the heavyweight<br> champion of pimps.<br> Hey, shut up and get in.<br> That jacket's a mess, man.<br> What you in Philly for?<br> Philly's my town.<br> Well, I just wanted to get<br> a little closer to you, honey.<br> Man, fuck you.<br> There'll be two undefeated heavyweight<br> champions, and they ain't fightin'.<br> - What about your license?<br> - I can fight in Atlanta.<br> There ain't no state boxing commission<br> in Georgia.<br> It's all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta<br> against Jerry Quary...<br> but we got to get this<br> steamroller movin' right now.<br> So what do I have to do?<br> All you got to do is announce<br> that after I whup Jerry Quary...<br> you gonna give me a title shot.<br> Come on, man.<br> Say it! Say it!<br> What I got and all I got,<br> I got with these right here.<br> Hell, man, I already got the title.<br> So I ain't got nothin' to win,<br> but I got eveythin' to lose.<br> Yeah, but you know<br> you ain't the real champ yet.<br> You beat Quary...<br> I'm gonna get you in the ring.<br> I'm gonna kick your ass.<br> By the way...<br> you need any money<br> or anything to tide you by?<br> No, I'm fine.<br> Time!<br> What you want?<br> Take me back, boss.<br> I'm clean.<br> This is a resurrection.<br> This is God's act.<br> And the prophet is goin' home.<br> Take me with you, boss.<br> I'll do anything.<br> Your hands can't hit<br> what your eyes can't see.<br> Float like a butterfly,<br> sting like a bee.<br> Rumble, young man, rumble.<br> God ain't watching'!<br> Ain't nobody but us!<br> God ain't watching'!<br> Ain't nobody but us!<br> There it is!<br> Stay in his face!<br> Go, Muhammad!<br> There it is!<br> Now for the right. Boom!<br> Prophet is goin' home<br> to the throne.<br> That's how you do it, Ali.<br> That's how you do it.<br> You okay?<br> You're a goddamn Superman.<br> Ain't no kryptonite<br> in this ring tonight.<br> - We want Joe Frazier!<br> - We want him!<br> - We want Joe Frazier!<br> - And you deserve it. You deserve it.<br> This prophet is comin' home,<br> goin' from the darkness to the light.<br> Soak it in this<br> for about 20 minutes.<br> We don't need their management.<br> Hey, Herbert, we did good.<br> Doin' good tonight.<br> All praise to Allah.<br> The messenger has lifted<br> your suspension.<br> Congratulations.<br> So you're sayin'<br> I can be a Muslim again.<br> - Yes.<br> - I ain't never stopped.<br> Just like I ain't never stopped<br> bein' the champ.<br> I begged my father<br> to reinstate you.<br> When? When you do that, Herbert?<br> After I promoted this Quary fight<br> or after I won it?<br> - We can get Frazier.<br> - Man, I done already got Frazier.<br> We can get $5 million for Frazier.<br> We talkin' management,<br> talkin' money or talkin' religion?<br> When I got leery<br> and talked up why I'm broke...<br> then come the suspension.<br> Now you explain that one to me,<br> my brother.<br> That was my father.<br> Your father.<br> I love your father, Herbert.<br> I swear, man. I love the Nation.<br> But it don't own me.<br> You go on out there<br> and you make that Frazier deal.<br> My brother.<br> Yeah, your brother Herbert.<br> Go on somewhere,<br> make that deal.<br> And he accepts me.<br> I'm Jewish, but yet he's Muslim...<br> and we still get along.<br> He understands me. He understands me<br> and he still allows me to hang with him.<br> He knows I like pork and white women,<br> but still allows me to be here with him.<br> Now, I can give up pork...<br> but them white women,<br> goddamn it!<br> How you deal with it, boy?<br> Hello?<br> Muhammad, it's for you.<br> Thank you, Lana.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Muhammad? Howard Cosell.<br> - You TKO'd them.<br> - Hey, what you talkin' about, Howard?<br> - With Quary?<br> - No.<br> The Supreme Court ruled today...<br> in the case of The United States<br> vs. Cassius Clay...<br> aka Muhammad Ali.<br> You won an eight-to-zero<br> unanimous decision.<br> You're free.<br> Congratulations.<br> I'm free.<br> The Supreme Court<br> just set me free.<br> What are you talkin' about?<br> Eight-to-oh, unanimous decision.<br> The Supreme Court<br> just overturned my conviction.<br> - Yes!<br> - All right. All right.<br> - Did we get 'em, Ali?<br> - We got 'em, man.<br> Hey, man.<br> - Did we do it?<br> - We did it, man.<br> They wanna be on your side now because<br> the truth has shown itself to the power.<br> Now the power's comin' to the truth.<br> That's what it is.<br> And the truth tastes good<br> when there's a belly full of lies.<br> - What you talkin' about?<br> - It don't matter. It don't matter.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> for the undisputed heavyweight<br> championship of the world.<br> In this corner, the contender and former<br> heavyweight champion of the world...<br> weighing in at 213 pounds...<br> with a record of 31 and 0<br> with 25 knockouts...<br> Muhammad Ali!<br> His opponent,<br> weighing in at 2051/2 pounds...<br> with a record of26 and 0<br> with 23 knockouts...<br> the current heavyweight<br> champion of the world...<br> Smokin?

It is over!<br> It'd be easy to get a fight<br> with Frazier now.<br> Only thing he's champion of<br> is gettin' knocked down.<br> George Foreman is<br> the heavyweight champion of the world.<br> The Rumble in the Jungle.<br> That is the name that I've given it.<br> Muhammad Ali and George Foreman<br> in Kinshasa, Zaire.<br> - Don, Zaire?<br> - Yeah, Don.<br> I mean, why not Antarctica,<br> somethin' like that?<br> What's wrong with New York City?<br> Because you miss the significance.<br> See, I dream of overcoming<br> to the dawn of a new day of liberation,<br> financial and otherwise.<br> It will raise up the spirits<br> of our inner cities.<br> It will rise up and fill with hope,<br> the souls...<br> the unrequited needs<br> of the black proletariat.<br> That is, the discouraged, dispirited,<br> denigrated denizens...<br> of the demimonde<br> that is called the ghetto.<br> Man, Don, you crazy.<br> You must've studied the whole<br> "D" section of the dictionary.<br> Good morning, sister.<br> Hi, brother.<br> How you doin', champ?<br> Why they saying that?<br> What they sayin'?<br> What that mean?<br> I don't understand.<br> - It means--<br> - What?<br> It mean, "Ali, kill him.<br> Ali, kill him."<br> The champ is here!<br> Ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight<br> champion of the world has arrived!<br> The champ is here!<br> Hey, man.<br> He's quite younger than you.<br> How you feeling about that?<br> He's quite younger than me?<br> Well, we quite younger than you.<br> What you talkin' about? Thirty-two<br> years old. Best shape of my life.<br> Hey, stop!<br> All right, back up.<br> Did you see Muhammad Ali?<br> - Here's your water.<br> - Oh, thank you, hon.<br> Bottled water.<br> Frozen steaks.<br> Brought all that stuffin<br> like Africa's ain't got no steaks.<br> - You could pick up parasites.<br> - Mobutu eats it.<br> Mobutu's takin' care of Mobutu.<br> He steals all the wealth<br> and sends it to Switzerland.<br> What that got to do<br> with any of why we here?<br> We are here 'cause Don King<br> got Mobutu to put up $10 million.<br> Don King don't care about Africa.<br> He's worse than Herbert.<br> Here come Herbert.<br> And Don King fit right in too.<br> Now he's a dashiki-wearin' rip-off.<br> Don King delivered the first-ever...<br> black-promoted<br> championship fight in Africa.<br> Don King talks black,<br> lives white and thinks green.<br> And you're defending him<br> and Brother Herbert?<br> 'Cause clean-cut Muslims in a parade<br> on the South Side of Chicago...<br> ain't gonna get this done!<br> I got to put honkies with connections<br> and bad-ass niggas to it.<br> And now they matched you up<br> against George Foreman.<br> Do you think they give a damn<br> if you get killed?<br> So that's what you think?<br> I just wanna know why<br> my Muslim husband...<br> is allowing himself<br> to get strung up on a cross.<br> Just tell me why.<br> Mayum's sick.<br> Maybe I ought to go back<br> to Chicago and look after her?<br> Sure.<br> Well, then I guess<br> I'll be back before the fight.<br> If that's all right, my husband.<br> This fight is no contest!<br> He is entirely too slow to fight me.<br> I say that George Foreman<br> is a mummy.<br> He's too slow.<br> You know I name all my fighters.<br> I'm gonna call George Foreman<br> "The Mummy."<br> He fight like a mummy.<br> And when I see George throwin' punches,<br> this is what I hear:<br> Here come the left.<br> Here come the right.<br> But the mummy can't hit<br> what the mummy can't see...<br> 'cause I'm too fast for him.<br> I'm too fast.<br> I'm too fast. I'm too fast.<br> I move too good for him.<br> I'll hit George Foreman so many times,<br> he'll think he's surrounded.<br> He gonna say, "Call the police!<br> It's five of 'em in here!"<br> I'm bad, man. I'm bad!<br> Muhammad, I'm sorry.<br> I have to ask.<br> Are you really<br> fast enough anymore...<br> to beat George Foreman?<br> If he gets you against the ropes,<br> he can knock you out with either hand.<br> Many people believe you're not the man<br> you used to be ten years ago.<br> See, now, Howard...<br> I didn't even want to talk<br> about this, man.<br> Especially not out here<br> in front of all these people.<br> But I talked to your wife...<br> and she said you not the man<br> you used to be two years ago!<br> Champ.<br> - Champ, George had an accident.<br> - He-- He had what?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - He got cut right above his right eye.<br> His sparring partner's elbow<br> split it open.<br> - Can he fight?<br> - Not for six weeks.<br> This is not a humorous situation,<br> my champ.<br> This postponement could be long,<br> especially if George leaves.<br> You tying to<br> pull something here, Don?<br> If George leaves, he ain't comin' back.<br> George don't like it here.<br> How right you are, my suspicious<br> and short Italian brother.<br> Look here, man,<br> my fiduciary responsibility...<br> to this first all-black promotion...<br> is analogous to a garden in the African<br> sun-- it must grow, it must bloom.<br> Cannot flower in the gloom and shade<br> of postponement to the Astrodome...<br> or any dome out of Zaire where it be<br> deprivileged of light and bled of water.<br> 'Cause what gonna be bleedin' out of<br> there is money-- a hemorrhage of cash.<br> I'm talkin' about blood on the floor.<br> Double hotel costs, airplane,<br> travel costs, food and beverage.<br> - So what do you want us to do?<br> - Muhammad Ali. The people's champion.<br> My black brother.<br> I need you.<br> I need your strength.<br> I need you to find a way<br> to get George to stay.<br> Be Moses in reverse.<br> Do not let my people go.<br> Keep them the fuck right here in Egypt.<br> - If you'll pardon my Swahili.<br> - Lingala.<br> - Say what?<br> - They speak Lingala.<br> Ali wants his title,<br> and he wants it in Zaire.<br> Okay, all right, okay.<br> Let's take it back.<br> George go, George go.<br> Hell, I can get you Joe Frazier.<br> Ali-Frazier 3.<br> That's the fight everybody want to see.<br> - We don't want Frazier, we want George.<br> - Hell, I don't control George Foreman.<br> There's been an accidental injury<br> to George Foreman in training.<br> The truth is...<br> George knocked his self out.<br> That's right.<br> He did three rounds, realized<br> he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali...<br> and knocked his self out.<br> I predict that when the fight is set,<br> he might not show.<br> Oh, you bad.<br> - That's right, I'm a bad man.<br> - Ain't no doubt about that.<br> Yeah, but you tell George<br> the same thing.<br> I heard you.<br> I been watching you.<br> I know he's your man, I know you got<br> him picked, but the man is in trouble.<br> The whole world was gonna know,<br> but now he ain't gonna show.<br> In order to ensure that George is ready,<br> we are thinking of postponing...<br> from September 24 to October 30.<br> What about the concert?<br> The concert will go on as planned.<br> Those dates are September 20, 21--<br> I want all the helicopters guarded,<br> all the private planes, private boats.<br> I'm serious.<br> I want the airports--<br> I want President Mobutu<br> and all his paratroopers--<br> All you Zaireans,<br> y'all be on guard too.<br> Any strange boats creeping away,<br> they might be taking him out.<br> Bus stations.<br> And bus stations!<br> Right.<br> Watch the bus stations.<br> The elephant caravans-- They might be<br> tying to take him out on an elephant.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - Hell, I ain't talking to you.<br> Hey. Hey, man.<br> Don't you never talk<br> to Angelo like that.<br> Don't you never talk to Angie<br> like that again.<br> Something wrong with you, man?<br> Think you callin' some shots here?<br> You ain't callin' nothin'.<br> They all know.<br> All them ladies out there,<br> they know I'm ready.<br> I see fear in the eyes<br> of his followers.<br> This was supposed to be the fight<br> that Muhammad Ali was ended.<br> Supposed to be Muhammad was gonna fall.<br> Supposed to be my destruction.<br> Well, they miscalculated.<br> They misjudged.<br> They got it wrong.<br> Hold on a second.<br> What's your name?<br> Veronica Porche.<br> Porche.
