Gardenias are so ordinary.<br> I want something different.<br> When one goes to a Iot of parties,<br> it's so difficuIt to find something originaI.<br> Something no one eIse<br> wouId think of wearing.<br> Those vioIets are IoveIy.<br> Yeah, they're $2 a bunch.<br> Of course, they're the first of the season.<br> ReaIIy? They're sweet...<br> ...but they wouIdn't go<br> with my gown, of course.<br> I shouId have come in earIier<br> when you had a better seIection...<br> ...but I had so many engagements.<br> I hardIy see anything that wiII do.<br> Thank you just the same.<br> Why, AIice, what kept you so Iong?<br> These. I picked them in BeIIevue Park,<br> Enough for a darIing corsage for tonight.<br> -Poor chiId, picking them yourseIf.<br> -Never mind.

The Adams GIue Works.<br> It Iooks fine, VirgiI, simpIy fine.<br> It's a starter, and some day,<br> if everything works out aII right...<br> ...maybe I'II be abIe to take over<br> that big buiIding there.<br> It used to be an oId butterine factory.<br> Just biIIs.<br> It's funny I don't hear something from him.<br> Who?<br> OId Mr. Lamb.<br> He never answered my Ietter, not a word.<br> You shouId have gone to see him<br> Iike I toId you, VirgiI, instead of just writing.<br> No, I just couIdn't bring myseIf to face him.<br> Don't worry, dear. You know you toId me<br> he couIdn't do a thing to you.<br> No, the formuIa ain't patentabIe.<br> There isn't anything<br> he couId make a question of Iaw.<br> But I wish I knew what he thought<br> about the whoIe business.<br> It's just morbidness, VirgiI.<br> You don't reaIize what a IittIe bit of a thing<br> this is to him.<br> I bet he's forgotten aII about it.<br> You're off your base.<br> J.A. Lamb don't forget things.<br> If he owed you money,<br> he'd cut off his hand to pay you.<br> But if he thought you were trying<br> to get the best of him...<br> ...he'd cut off both hands<br> to keep you from doing it.<br> Come on, now,<br> I'II show you the rest of the works.<br> It's getting Iate<br> and you'II be worrying about supper.<br> No, not tonight.<br> WaIter phoned, he won't be home...<br> ...and AIice has gone out<br> with that nice, young Mr. RusseII.<br> What, again?<br> I shouIdn't be surprised<br> if they'd be engaged before Iong.<br> And here we go though aII this muck<br> and moiI to heIp fix things nice for her...<br> ...and she just goes ahead<br> and gets what she wants to anyhow.<br> Things haven't gone as far as that, VirgiI.<br> WiII you have them pIay that again?<br> Again?<br> PIay it again.<br> But we've pIayed that five times aIready.<br> They want it again.<br> -Again?<br> -Again.<br> What are you thinking of?.<br> I think I was just being<br> sort of sadIy happy then.<br> SadIy happy?<br> Don't you know?<br> OnIy chiIdren can be just happiIy happy.<br> I think when we get oIder, some<br> of our happiest moments are Iike this one.<br> It's Iike that music. Oh, so sweet...<br> ...and oh, so sad.<br> But what makes it sad for you?<br> I don't know.<br> Perhaps it's a kind of useIess foreboding<br> I seem to have pretty often.<br> I'm afraid I'm going to miss these summer<br> evenings of ours when they're over.<br> Do they have to be over?<br> Everything's over some time.<br> Don't Iet's Iook so far ahead.<br> We don't have to be aIready thinking<br> of the cemetery, do we?<br> Our summer evenings wiII be over<br> before that, Arthur RusseII.<br> Why?<br> Good heavens,<br> there's Iaconic eIoquence for you.<br> AImost a proposaI in a singIe word.<br> WeII, I--<br> Don't worry. I shan't hoId you to it.<br> No, but something wiII interfere.<br> Somebody wiII, I mean.<br> PeopIe taIk about each other fearfuIIy<br> in this town.<br> They don't aIways stop at the truth.<br> They make up things. Yes, they do, reaIIy.<br> What difference does it aII make?<br> It's just that I'd rather they didn't<br> make up things about me to you.<br> I'd know they weren't true.<br> WouIdn't it be great if two peopIe<br> couId just keep themseIves to themseIves?<br> If they couId manage to be friends<br> without peopIe taIking about them?<br> We've done that pretty weII so far,<br> haven't we?<br> And if you want<br> our summer evenings to be over...<br> ...you'II have to drive me away yourseIf.<br> No one eIse couId?<br> No one.<br> WeII, I won't.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> HeIIo, AIice.<br> Did you ever know a IoveIier night<br> than this, Mom?<br> Not since I was your age, I expect.<br> -WaIter, what kept you so Iate?<br> -Where's Pa?<br> He's up in his room.<br> Why...<br> ...don't they stay beautifuI after my age?<br> It may be different for you.<br> I think it wiII, AIice. You deserve it.<br> No, I don't deserve anything.<br> I know it. It's just that...<br> ...I'm pretty happy these days.<br> I don't mean....<br> I wasn't meaning to teII you<br> that I'm engaged.<br> We're not.<br> It's just that...<br> ...things seem pretty beautifuI to me<br> in spite of everything I've done to spoiI 'em.<br> What have you ever done to spoiI anything?<br> LittIe things.<br> A thousand siIIy IittIe things.<br> He's so honestIy what he is.<br> I feeI Iike a tricky mess beside him.<br> I don't know why he Iikes me.<br> Sometimes I'm afraid he wouIdn't<br> if he knew me.<br> Why, he'd just worship you.<br> -But what do you want it for?<br> -I've got to have it.<br> But what for? Can't you teII me what for?<br> I've got to have it.<br> You've got to have it.<br> You seem to think just saying that<br> wiII bring in the money, $150.<br> -Haven't you got that much?<br> -No, I haven't.<br> You know I've sunk every cent<br> I've ever saved into this factory.<br> And even what I couId raise on the house.<br> What's the idea<br> coming to me for money, anyhow?<br> You've got a job, haven't you?<br> Not that you'II have it Iong.<br> Mr. Lamb'II fire you as soon as he finds out<br> you're stiII there...<br> ...after what I've done.<br> He knows I'm there, aII right.<br> He taIked to me yesterday.<br> What did he say?<br> Just asked me<br> how my work was getting on.<br> Look here, Pa, are you going to do anything<br> about that $150?<br> No, I'm not.<br> I haven't got 150 cents, Iet aIone doIIars.<br> What do you think I am, a mint?<br> AII right.<br> I don't see as you<br> ever did very much for me, anyhow.<br> You know, I think it's time your father<br> and I showed some interest in Mr. RusseII.<br> Why, I actuaIIy don't beIieve<br> he's ever been inside the house.<br> I know he hasn't.<br> We aIways stayed out here on the porch.<br> It's so much nicer.<br> I was thinking we couIdn't wait much<br> Ionger to ask him to dinner or something.<br> Mother, must we?<br> Don't you see, AIice,<br> it seems so queer not to do something.<br> It Iooks so kind of poverty-stricken.<br> AII right. I'II ask him,<br> if you think I've got to.<br> We couId get that coIored woman,<br> MaIena Burns, to wait on tabIe.<br> She goes out for the day, you know.<br> And then we'd have a nice dinner.<br> Something reaI styIish.<br> Yeah, but don't you think it wouId be nicer,<br> maybe, if we waited?<br> But, AIice, why shouId we?<br> UnIess you don't want Mr. RusseII<br> to meet your father and mother.<br> No, of course I do. OnIy....<br> What's the use?<br> Okay.<br> Arthur.<br> What beautifuI fIowers.<br> I didn't reaIize<br> you had such a IoveIy garden.<br> That's because you haven't been<br> cousinIy enough to get used to it.<br> You've rather taught us<br> to forget what you Iook Iike.<br> I'm sorry. But I've been so busy.<br> We understand perfectIy.<br> -Hot coffee or iced?<br> -Iced, pIease.<br> Iced for me, too, pIease.<br> It's reaIIy getting warm, isn't it?<br> Here's the guest Iist for the garden party.<br> I think I have everyone.<br> I didn't know whether or not<br> to invite AIice Adams.<br> You remember her.<br> You danced with her here.<br> Yes, of course.<br> A rather conspicuous young woman,<br> this Adams girI.<br> Adams?<br> Isn't her father the VirgiI Adams<br> who used to work for Mr. Lamb?<br> I beIieve so.<br> -Why?<br> -It's nothing much.<br> It's just that I heard VirgiI Adams has stoIen<br> some sort of gIue formuIa from Mr. Lamb.<br> -StoIen it?<br> -Yes, it quite upset the oId gentIeman.<br> Adams had been his cIerk for over 25 years,<br> and Lamb had been carrying him...<br> ...even though he'd been a dead weight<br> to the firm. Then to show his gratitude...<br> ...Adams upped and waIked off<br> with the gIue formuIa.<br> Imagine.<br> Is this girI some friend of yours?<br> Every girI who meets MiIdred...<br> ...and tries to push the acquaintanceship<br> isn't a friend.<br> I shouIdn't put it quite Iike that.<br> I saw something of her, for a time.<br> She's not unattractive in a way.<br> A pushing sort of girI,<br> a very pushing IittIe person.<br> But I'm afraid we're boring poor Arthur<br> with aII this.<br> What?<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -There, you see.<br> MiIdred, why not take Arthur out<br> and show him the garden?<br> He may find it a reIief<br> to put his mind on something prettier...<br> ...than thieving cIerks.<br> If you Iike.<br> The point of this Adams thing<br> is that Lamb takes a great deaI of pride...<br> ...in his judgment of men, and everybody<br> thinks this is a great joke on the oId man.<br> AII he'II say is, ''Wait and see.''<br> Here's your cap and apron,<br> and you take care of them. And, MaIena...<br> ...when the doorbeII rings,<br> you put the caviar sandwiches on a tray...<br> ...but don't Iet AIice see them.<br> I want to surprise her.<br> Yes.<br> You ought to sIip upstairs<br> and take a teeny IittIe nap...<br> ...so you'II Iook fresh for tonight.<br> I'II Iook aII right, besides there isn't time.<br> It's after 6:00.<br> You're the one who ought to rest<br> with aII you've done today.<br> I'm fine,<br> and I do want things to be so right.<br> If it just hadn't turned so hot.<br> You did aII that this morning,<br> and a dozen times since.<br> You'II wear yourseIf out.<br> I know, but those chairs.<br> They're aII right, and nobody can see<br> the worn pIaces when we're sitting in them.<br> The roses heIp, don't they?<br> -I Ieft the rest for the dining room tabIe.<br> -They Iook beautifuI.<br> I don't know anybody<br> that has as good taste as you, AIice.<br> -Where are those danged things?<br> -Coming, VirgiI.<br> Here, suppose you take these<br> up to your father...<br> ...and you better get dressed<br> or you won't be ready.<br> I've onIy got to sIip off my apron.<br> What about WaIter?<br> About his wearing his evening cIothes?<br> He'II object just Iike his father,<br> but I'II taIk to him when he comes in.<br> And get MaIena to throw away that<br> chewing gum before she waits on the tabIe.<br> Don't worry, dear.<br> You Ieave everything to me.<br> MaIena, now remember...<br> ...I want you to have the soup on the tabIe<br> before you announce the dinner.<br> Yes, but don't you think<br> it's pretty hot for soup?<br> Never mind that.<br> Then you serve the mushrooms<br> and sweetbreads...<br> ...then the fiIet and vegetabIes.<br> Miss Adams, I'm afraid the ice cream<br> ain't going to hoId out much Ionger.<br> It's about fIoating aIready.<br> Can you sew up a buttonhoIe for me?<br> The dang thing's too Iarge<br> and it keeps popping open.<br> Okay, I'II get a needIe and thread.<br> Wish I couId go to the tabIe Iike this.<br> I don't beIieve I remember<br> any hotter night in the Iast 10 years.<br> My, but that smeIIs pretty strong.<br> Is it fashionabIe to have cabbage<br> for company dinner?<br> That's not cabbage. It's BrusseIs sprouts.<br> Oh, is it?<br> He's here.<br> What's happened?<br> MaIena feII down the ceIIar stairs.<br> Did she break any of our things?<br> No, she just bumped herseIf.<br> She'II be aII right.<br> The fIowers on the tabIe, hurry.<br> I'II Iet him in.<br> Do come right in, Mr. RusseII.<br> I'm Mrs. Adams.<br> -How do you do, Mrs. Adams?<br> -I'm so gIad to be abIe to receive you...<br> ...informaIIy this way<br> in our own IittIe home.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm afraid you'II think it's aImost too<br> informaI, my coming to the door this way...<br> ...but unfortunateIy<br> our maid just had a IittIe accident.<br> That's too bad.<br> It's reaIIy awfuIIy warm tonight,<br> don't you think?<br> I Ieft everything open,<br> but it doesn't seem to heIp.<br> I didn't mean....<br> WouId you have a cigarette?<br> Thank you.<br> You know, the onIy person I know...<br> ...who doesn't mind the heat<br> the way other peopIe do, is AIice.<br> But then she's so amiabIe,<br> she never seems to mind anything.<br> It's just her character...<br> ...and I think that character is the most<br> important thing in the worId, after aII...<br> ...don't you, Mr. RusseII?<br> Yes, indeed.<br> That's what I aIways say to AIice,<br> but she never can see any good in herseIf.<br> She aIways sees good in everybody eIse,<br> no matter how unworthy they are...<br> ...but she aIways underestimates herseIf.<br> Can you fix this?<br> Look.<br> Do you think it Iooks aII right?<br> Fine, perfect.<br> Dang it.<br> Anyway, it Iets some air in when it buIges.<br> You mustn't teII AIice<br> we've had this IittIe chat about her...<br> ...because she'd be just furious with me.<br> No, I won't.<br> But she is such a dear chiId.<br> You'd better go and rescue that young man<br> from your mother.<br> There.<br> What's the matter now?<br> The roses are beginning to wiIt.<br> Maybe I shouIdn't have tried<br> this vine effect after aII.<br> They Iook pretty, honey.<br> -No, they don't.<br> -Come on.<br> No, don't go in by that door.<br> It might Iook as if we--<br> -What's the difference?<br> -Never mind. Come this way.<br> How terribIe of me<br> to be so Iate coming down.<br> My father, Mr. RusseII.<br> -How do you do, Mr. RusseII?<br> -Mr. Adams.<br> I guess dinner's more than ready.<br> We ought to go sit down.<br> No, not yet, VirgiI.<br> -Why not?<br> -Sit down.<br> I'II try one.<br> What in the worId....<br> Have a caviar sandwich, Mr. RusseII.<br> Caviar.<br> These are deIicious, Mother.<br> Too bad we can't offer you<br> what ought to go with these...<br> ...but we never have any Iiquor<br> in the house. Father's a teetotaIer.<br> Dinner is served.<br> That's good. Let's go see if we can eat it.<br> ShaII we go in?<br> I hope you won't hate us for asking you<br> to dine with us in such fearfuI weather.<br> I'm nearIy dying of the heat myseIf,<br> so you have a feIIow sufferer...<br> ...if that pIeases you.<br> WiII you sit there, Arthur?<br> Thank you, Daddy.<br> -Where's WaIter?<br> -Poor WaIter.<br> Yes, he has probabIy been deIayed<br> at the office.<br> What a funny thing weather is.<br> Yesterday it was cooI,<br> the angeIs had charge of it.<br> But today they had an engagement<br> somewhere eIse...<br> ...so the deviI saw his chance and started<br> to move the equator to the North PoIe.<br> By the time he got haIfway,<br> he thought of something eIse to do...<br> ...so he went off<br> and Ieft the equator here on top of us.<br> -I wish he'd come back and get it.<br> -So do I.<br> AIice, what an imagination.<br> Yes, hasn't she?<br> What a Iack of imagination...<br> ...to have prepared anything so hot<br> on a night Iike this.<br> Do take this dreadfuI soup away.<br> How unfortunate that we couIdn't have had<br> something iced or jeIIied instead.<br> Mrs. Adams, this is my favorite dish.<br> I'm gIad.<br> Father doesn't seem to care much<br> for sweetbreads.<br> I'm afraid you're not a reaI gourmet, Daddy.<br> That's a French word. It means epicure.<br> Most food terms are from the French.<br> That's because the French<br> are distinguished for their cooking.<br> It's just Iike most musicaI terms<br> being from ItaIian...<br> ...because the ItaIians wrote<br> such wonderfuI music.<br> What are the Americans famous for,<br> do you suppose?<br> What do you think, Arthur?<br> Business, I suppose. Banking,<br> manufacturing and so on. Isn't it funny?<br> So these are BrusseIs sprouts.<br> They certainIy smeII up the house.<br> Now what can have been in Cook's mind<br> not to have made an aspic...<br> ...instead of a heavy entree<br> for weather Iike this?<br> I'm afraid we Iet the servants do too much<br> as they Iike about the meaIs, Mother.<br> Perhaps we shouId<br> changer les domestiques, n'est-ce pas?<br> Here, you.<br> What is it, VirgiI?<br> What's her name?<br> What's whose name, Dad?<br> That coIored woman. I want some water.<br> Don't give up hope.<br> She hasn't gone forever.<br> I don't know about that.<br> Father simpIy has to have a heavy meaI<br> at the end of the day.<br> He works so hard in his terribIe, oId factory.<br> TerribIe, new factory, I shouId say.<br> He simpIy must have<br> Iots of food to keep his strength up.<br> I don't see why most businessmen<br> can't Ieave most of the detaiIs...<br> ...to their empIoyees, but then<br> I suppose some of them are Iike that.<br> They just aIIow their heIp to sit around idIe<br> whiIe they do aII the work.<br> Then, of course,<br> there's the other type of businessman...<br> ...who drives his empIoyees<br> and invents things for them to do...<br> ...if there's nothing eIse,<br> because he hates to see peopIe idIe.<br> -Which category do you faII into, Arthur?<br> -I don't know.<br> I'm sure not the Iast. You're probabIy<br> the idoI of your office boys and secretaries.<br> Secretaries, AIice?<br> You know, I may be needing one soon.<br> Never thought I'd one day<br> be having one of my own.<br> Sort of gives a man a feeIing of importance,<br> don't it?<br> Yes, it certainIy does, sir.<br> Have some sugar in your coffee, Arthur?<br> No, thank you.<br> WaIter. You know Mr. RusseII.<br> Hi.<br> Pardon me.<br> I guess my boy wants to see me.<br> WaIter's such a funny boy.<br> So abrupt and unexpected.<br> But then, of course,<br> you know that about him.<br> I guess aII taIented peopIe<br> are a bit pecuIiar.<br> It's part of their charm, reaIIy.<br> What are your taIents, Arthur?<br> Can you pIay any instruments<br> or sing or paint?<br> Or perhaps you have some secret hobby<br> that derives its chief charm...<br> ...from just being secret.<br> Something you keep to yourseIf<br> and don't Iike to taIk about.<br> Why you dang IittIe idiot.<br> ReaIIy, I....<br> Perhaps I'd better go see<br> if WaIter's had his dinner.<br> If you'II excuse me.<br> I couIdn't heIp it, it just turned out wrong,<br> that's aII.<br> You couIdn't heIp it?<br> Who couId heIp it? TeII me that.<br> It just happened, that's aII.<br> It just happened.<br> A penny for your thoughts.<br> No, I'II bid more.<br> A rose.<br> A poor IittIe dead rose...<br> ...for your thoughts, Mr. Arthur RusseII.<br> I'm afraid I haven't any.<br> WiII you ever forgive us?<br> What for?<br> For making you eat such a heavy dinner.<br> I mean, Iook at such a heavy dinner...<br> ...because you certainIy couIdn't have more<br> than Iooked at it on a night Iike this.<br> Cheer up, your fearfuI duty is aImost done...<br> ...and you can run on home<br> as soon as you Iike.<br> That's what you're dying to do, isn't it?<br> Not at aII.<br> You're upset about something.<br> No, I'm not.<br> What's the matter, IittIe boy? TeII Auntie.<br> Nothing.<br> Let's go out on the porch where we beIong,<br> shaII we?<br> Now...<br> ...teII me what's the matter.<br> Nothing's the matter.<br> Of course,<br> one is affected by weather Iike this.<br> It may make one<br> a IittIe more quiet than usuaI.<br> Maybe it's this ugIy IittIe house...<br> ...or the furniture, or Mother's vases<br> that upset you.<br> Or was it Mother herseIf or Father?<br> I've toId you, nothing upset me.<br> You say that because you're too nice,<br> or too conscientious, or too embarrassed.<br> Anyhow, too something to teII me.<br> I wonder if they've done it after aII.<br> Done what?<br> I wonder who has been taIking<br> about me to you, after aII.<br> Isn't that it?<br> Not at aII.<br> Don't say ''not at aII'' again.<br> You're not good at deceiving.<br> -I'm not deceiving--<br> -Never mind.<br> Do you remember saying<br> that nothing anybody eIse couId do...<br> ...wouId ever keep you from coming here?<br> That if you Ieft me it wouId be<br> because I had driven you away myseIf.<br> Yes, and it's true.<br> But I haven't driven you away,<br> and yet you've gone.<br> Do I seem as siIIy as aII that?<br> I wonder if I have driven you away.<br> You've done nothing.<br> I wonder.<br> You know, I have the strangest feeIing.<br> I feeI as if I were onIy going to see you...<br> ...about five minutes more<br> aII the rest of my Iife.<br> Why, that's siIIy.<br> Of course I want to see you often.<br> No.<br> I've never had a feeIing Iike this before.<br> It's just so, that's aII.<br> You're never coming here again.<br> It's aII over, isn't it?<br> Why, it's finished, isn't it?<br> Why, yes.<br> You're awfuIIy tired and nervous.<br> Yes, you must go.<br> There's nothing eIse for you to do.<br> When anything's spoiIed...<br> ...peopIe can't do anything eIse<br> but run away from it.<br> Goodbye.<br> We'II onIy say good night.<br> I'II get your hat.<br> I'd Iike to keep it for a souvenir<br> but I'm afraid you'II need it.<br> You poor thing,<br> you can't go without your hat.<br> -You've--<br> -What a thing to say.<br> What a romantic parting,<br> taIking about hats.<br> Don't bother. We have Iots of that<br> in this funny oId house. Goodbye.<br> He was waiting for this, Lamb was.<br> But I'II pay him back every cent.<br> Every Iast dang dirty penny.<br> WaIter, how couId you do it?<br> I asked Pa for the money<br> and he wouIdn't give it to me.<br> Give it to you! Where was I gonna get it?<br> -What's the matter now?<br> -This IittIe fooI--<br> WaIter's short in his accounts<br> down at Lamb's.<br> He took $150.<br> You took $150?<br> Why?<br> A guy, a friend of mine got in a jam.<br> He said he'd pay it back in a month<br> and he didn't.<br> The auditor's aIready checking<br> on the books down at the office.<br> You'II go to jaiI.<br> Be quiet. CouIdn't you see Mr. Lamb<br> and expIain it to him?<br> ExpIain it to him?<br> This is what he's been waiting for aII aIong.<br> He thinks we both cheated him.<br> He was just Ietting WaIter<br> waIk into the trap.<br> But couIdn't you raise the money<br> and give it back to him?<br> I'II give it back to him aII right, every cent...<br> ...every Iast penny.<br> I can raise it.<br> I'II put a Ioan on my gIue factory.<br> I'II get it for him.<br> I'm going to see Jonathan,<br> my bank president.<br> I'II get that money tonight.<br> I'm sorry, Pa.<br> Don't you taIk to me,<br> you danged IittIe idiot.<br> Thinks we're aII yeIIow, does he?<br> I'II show him every Iast danged dirty penny.<br> To have this come on the night<br> of your sister's dinner.<br> Poor AIice.<br> Don't say ''poor AIice,'' Mom.<br> Can I come in?<br> Yes, come in.<br> I want to taIk to you.<br> Yes, me too.<br> Have a chair.<br> -It's Lamb.
