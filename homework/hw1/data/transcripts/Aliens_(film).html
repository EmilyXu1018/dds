                        Bio-readouts are all in the green.<br> Looks like she's alive.<br> Well, there goes our salvage, guys.<br> How are we today?<br> Terrible.<br> Well, better than yesterday, at least.<br> - Where am I?<br> - You're safe.<br> You're at Gateway Station.<br> Been here a couple of days.<br> You were pretty groggy at first,<br> but now you're OK.<br> Looks like you've got a visitor.<br> Jonesy! Come here!<br> Hey, come here!<br> How are you, you stupid cat?<br> How are you!<br> Where have you been?<br> Guess you two have met, huh?<br> I'm Burke. Carter Burke.<br> I work for the company.<br> But... don't let that fool you.<br> I'm really an OK guy.<br> I'm glad to see you're feeling better.<br> They say that all the weakness<br> and disorientation should pass soon.<br> That's just natural side effects of such<br> a long hypersleep. Or something like that.<br> What do you mean?<br> How long was I out there?<br> Has no-one discussed this with you yet?<br> No. But, I mean, I don't...<br> ...recognise this place.<br> No, I know. Uh... OK.<br> It's just that, uh,<br> this might be a shock to you.<br> - It's longer...<br> - How long?<br> Please.<br> What?<br> That's the thing.<br> You were out there for 57 years.<br> You had drifted<br> right through the core systems.<br> And it's really just blind luck...<br> ...that a deep-salvage team<br> found you when they did.<br> It's one in a thousand, really.<br> You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.<br> You could be floating out there forever.<br> You OK?<br> Uh...<br> Oh!<br> You OK?<br> Oh!<br> God!<br> Nurse! Please!<br> Someone get in here now!<br> No!<br> Now!<br> Hold!<br> Please!<br> Hold her!<br> Kill me!<br> No!<br> No!<br> Bad dreams again?<br> - You want something to help you sleep?<br> - No.<br> I've slept enough.<br> Jonesy... come here.<br> Shh!<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right now.<br> It's over.<br> Hi. Sorry I'm late.<br> Been running behind all morning.<br> Is there any word about my daughter?<br> Uh... I think we should worry<br> about the hearing now.<br> I read your deposition...<br> ...and it's great.<br> If you stick to that, we'll be fine.<br> There are gonna be<br> a lot of heavyweights in there.<br> Feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission...<br> ...Colonial Administration,<br> insurance company guys.<br> Do you have any news about my daughter?<br> Well, we did come up with some information.<br> Why don't we sit down?<br> I was hoping to wait until after the inquest.<br> Uh...<br> Amanda Ripley McClaren...<br> Her married name, I guess?<br> Age 66.<br> And that was at the time of her death...<br> ...which was two years ago.<br> I'm real sorry.<br> Amy...<br> She was cremated...<br> ...and interred at Westlake Repository,<br> in Wisconsin.<br> No children mentioned.<br> I promised her...<br> ...that I would be home for her birthday.<br> Her eleventh birthday.<br> Ohh...<br> They'd like to go back to this<br> point about the override destruct order.<br> I don't understand this.<br> We have been here for three and a half hours.<br> How many different ways<br> do you want the same story?<br> Look at it from our perspective, please.<br> Please?<br> You admit to detonating the engines of, and<br> thereby destroying, an M-Class star freighter.<br> An expensive piece of hardware.<br> 42 million in adjusted dollars.<br> That's minus payload, of course.<br> The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates<br> some elements of your account.<br> In that, for reasons unknown,<br> the Nostromo set down on LV-426...<br> ...an unsurveyed planet at that time.<br> That it resumed its course, and was<br> subsequently set for self-destruct by you...<br> ...for reasons unknown.<br> Not for reasons unknown. I told you.<br> We set down there on company orders<br> to get this thing, which destroyed my crew...<br> ...and your expensive ship.<br> The analysis team found no physical<br> evidence of the creature you describe.<br> Good!<br> That's because I blew it out<br> of the goddamn air lock.<br> Like I said.<br> Are there any species like<br> this hostile organism on LV-426?<br> No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.<br> Did IQ's just drop sharply while I was away?<br> Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.<br> It was a derelict spacecraft. An alien ship.<br> It was not from there.<br> Do you get it? We homed in on its beacon.<br> And found something never recorded once<br> in over 300 surveyed worlds.<br> A creature that "gestates...<br> ...inside a living human host".<br> - Yes.<br> These are your words.<br> - "And has concentrated acid for blood."<br> - That's right.<br> Look, I can see where this is going,<br> but I'm telling you that...<br> ...those things exist.<br> - Thank you, Officer. That will be all.<br> Please! You're not listening.<br> Kane - the crew member...<br> Kane, who went into that ship, said<br> he saw thousands of eggs. Thousands.<br> Thank you. That will be all.<br> Goddamn it, that's not all! If one of those<br> things gets down here, that will be all!<br> Then all this bullshit that you think is so<br> important... you can kiss all that goodbye!<br> It is the finding<br> of this court of inquiry that...<br> ...Warrant Officer E Ripley...<br> ...NOC 14472...<br> ...has acted with questionable judgment...<br> ...and is unfit to hold an ICC licence<br> as a commercial flight officer.<br> Said licence is hereby suspended indefinitely.<br> No criminal charges will be filed against<br> you at this time, and you are released...<br> ...on your own recognisance for a six-month<br> period of psychometric probation...<br> ...to include monthly review<br> by an ICC psychiatric technician.<br> These proceedings are closed.<br> That could have been... better.<br> - Look, I think... Ripley?<br> - Van Leuwen.<br> Why don't you just check out LV-426?<br> Because I don't have to.<br> The people there have never complained<br> about any hostile organism.<br> What do you mean? What people?<br> Terraformers.<br> Planet engineers.<br> They set up atmosphere processors<br> to make the air breathable. Takes decades.<br> It's what we call a Shake 'n' Bake colony.<br> How many are there? How many colonists?<br> I don't know. 60, maybe 70, families.<br> Do you mind?<br> Families.<br> Jesus!<br> I'll be down in maintenance, OK?<br> - Al?<br> - What?<br> - Hey, Al.<br> - What?<br> Remember you sent some wildcatters<br> out past the alien range last week?<br> Yeah.<br> One of them's on the horn.<br> Says he's on to something.<br> Wants to know if his claim will be honoured.<br> Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?<br> Because you sent them<br> on company orders, maybe?<br> Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on<br> Earth says "Go look at a grid reference".<br> We look. They don't say why and I don't ask.<br> I don't ask because it takes two weeks<br> to get an answer out here.<br> And the answer is always "Don't ask".<br> So what do I tell this guy?<br> Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,<br> if he finds something, it is his.<br> - Lydecker?<br> - What?<br> You kids are not supposed<br> to be on this level! Get out of here!<br> You go in places we can't fit!<br> So? That's why I'm the best!<br> Knock it off! If I catch you playing<br> in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.<br> Mom, all the kids play...<br> Annie, come and have<br> a look at this, will ya?<br> Folks, we have scored big this time.<br> What is it, Dad?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Let's see if we can't get<br> a closer look at this thing.<br> - Shouldn't we call in?<br> - Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.<br> That's about as close as we can get.<br> Should we take a look inside?<br> You kids stay inside. I mean it.<br> We'll be right back.<br> - OK.<br> - Bye.<br> Timmy, they've been gone a long time.<br> It'll be OK. Dad knows what he's doing.<br> Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo<br> Two Four Niner calling Alpha Control!<br> This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!<br> Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman<br> of the Colonial Marine Corps...<br> Ripley, we have to talk.<br> We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.<br> I don't believe this.<br> You guys throw me to the wolves...<br> ...and now you want me to go back out there?<br> Forget it. It's not my problem.<br> - Can I finish?<br> - No.<br> There's no way.<br> You wouldn't be going in with the troops.<br> I can guarantee your safety.<br> These Colonial Marines are tough hombres.<br> They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.<br> There's nothing they can't handle.<br> Am I right?<br> We've been trained to deal<br> with situations like this.<br> Then you don't need me. I'm not a soldier.<br> We don't know what's going on out there.<br> It may just be a downed transmitter.<br> But if it's not...<br> ...I would like you there as an advisor,<br> and that's all.<br> What's your interest in all this?<br> Why are you going?<br> The corporation co-financed that colony<br> along with Colonial Administration.<br> We're doing a lot of terraforming,<br> building better worlds...<br> Yeah. I saw the commercial.<br> Look, I don't have time for this.<br> I've got to get to work.<br> Oh, right.<br> I heard you're working the cargo docks.<br> That's right.<br> - Running loaders and forklifts.<br> - Yeah. So?<br> Nothing. I think it's great<br> that you're keeping busy.<br> And I know it's the only thing that you<br> could get. There's nothing wrong with it.<br> What would you say if I told you<br> I could get you reinstated as a flight officer?<br> The company's already agreed<br> to pick up your contract.<br> If I go.<br> If you go.<br> Come on, that's a second chance, kiddo.<br> Get out there and face this thing.<br> Get back on the horse.<br> Spare me, Burke.<br> I've had my psych evaluation this month.<br> Yeah, I know. I've read it.<br> You wake up every night...<br> ...soaked in sweat...<br> - I said no! And I mean it!<br> Now please leave.<br> I am not going back! And I am...<br> I would not be any good to you if I did.<br> OK.<br> Shh.<br> Would you do me a favour?<br> Just think about it.<br> Thanks for the coffee.<br> Aagh!<br> Ohh!<br> Hello.<br> Ripley? You OK?<br> Just tell me one thing, Burke.<br> You're going out there to destroy them, right?<br> Not to study.<br> Not to bring back.<br> But to wipe them out.<br> That's the plan. You have my word on it.<br> All right, I'm in.<br> And you, you little shithead...<br> ...you're staying here.<br> They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.<br> Not enough to have to<br> wake up to your face, Drake.<br> What?<br> - Is that ajoke?<br> - Oh, I wish it were!<br> Hey, Hicks. Man, you lookjust like I feel.<br> All right, sweethearts,<br> what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?<br> Another glorious day in the Corps!<br> A day in the Marine Corps<br> is like a day on the farm.<br> Every meal's a banquet,<br> every paycheck a fortune.<br> Every formation a parade.<br> I love the Corps!<br> Man, this floor is freezing!<br> - You want me to fetch your slippers?<br> - Gee, would you, sir?<br> Look into my eye.<br> Fall in, people!<br> Come on, let's go.<br> I hate this job.<br> Crowe! Wierzbowski! On your feet!<br> I'm talking about breathing,<br> not this frozen shit.<br> Yeah, Top, how about it?<br> All right, first assembly's<br> in 15, people. Shag it!<br> Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?<br> She's supposed to be<br> some kind of consultant.<br> Apparently, she saw an alien once.<br> Whoopee-fucking-doo!<br> Hey, I'm impressed.<br> Qu bonita!<br> Hey, Vasquez.<br> Have you ever been mistaken for a man?<br> No. Have you?<br> Oh, Vasquez!<br> You're just too bad.<br> Hey, Top, what's the op?<br> It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.<br> There's some juicy colonists' daughters<br> we have to rescue from their virginity.<br> Dumb-ass colonists!<br> What's this crap supposed to be?<br> - Cornbread, I think.<br> - It's good for you, boy. Eat it.<br> I sure wouldn't mind getting more of that<br> Arcturian poontang. Remember that time?<br> - But the one that you had was male!<br> - Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!<br> - Hey, Bishop. Do the thing with the knife.<br> - Oh, please...<br> All right!<br> I don't wanna see that, man.<br> Come on, man. All right!<br> Hey, what are you doing, man?<br> What are you doing?<br> - Don't move.<br> - Quit messing, Drake!<br> Bishop! Hey, man!<br> - Do it, Bishop.<br> - Hey, not me, man!<br> Yeah, you. Don't move.<br> Trust me.<br> Aaaaggghhhhhh!<br> All right, knock it off.<br> Thank you.<br> Enjoy your meal.<br> That wasn't funny, man.<br> - Lieutenant Gorman?<br> - No.<br> - Mr Burke?<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> Looks like the new lieutenant's too good<br> to eat with the rest of us grunts.<br> The boy's definitely<br> got a corncob up his ass.<br> I thought you never missed, Bishop.<br> You never said an android<br> was on board. Why not?<br> It never occurred to me.<br> It's common practice<br> to have a synthetic on board.<br> I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.<br> Right.<br> - Is there a problem?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I didn't even... Ripley's last trip, the syn...<br> The artificial person...<br> ...malfunctioned.<br> - Malfunctioned?<br> There were problems and...<br> a few deaths were involved.<br> I'm shocked.<br> Was it an older model?<br> Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.<br> The A-2s always were a bit twitchy.<br> That could never happen now<br> with our behavioural inhibitors.<br> It is impossible for me to harm,<br> or allow to be harmed, a human being.<br> You sure you don't want some?<br> Just stay away from me, Bishop.<br> Guess she don't like the cornbread, either.<br> Squad! Atten-hut! Officer on deck!<br> As you were.<br> Quickly, quickly. Settle down.<br> All right, listen up!<br> Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have<br> time to brief you before we left Gateway...<br> - Sir?<br> - What is it, Hicks?<br> Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.<br> What's the question?<br> Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,<br> or another bug hunt?<br> All we know is there's still<br> no contact with the colony...<br> ...and a xenomorph may be involved.<br> - Excuse me, sir. A what?<br> - A xenomorph.<br> It's a bug hunt.<br> What exactly are we dealing with here?<br> Ripley?<br> I'll tell you what I know.<br> We set down on LV-426.<br> A crew member was brought back<br> with something attached to his face...<br> ...some kind of parasite.<br> We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.<br> Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die.<br> Kane seemed fine.<br> We were all having dinner.<br> It must have laid something inside<br> his throat, some sort of embryo.<br> He started...<br> Um, he...<br> Look, man,<br> I only need to know one thing:<br> Where they are.<br> - Go, Vasquez, kick ass!<br> - Anytime, anywhere.<br> Somebody said "alien". She thought<br> they said "illegal alien" and signed up!<br> - Fuck you, man.<br> - Anytime, anywhere.<br> Are you finished?<br> I hope you're right. I really do.<br> Yeah, OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.<br> We also have Ripley's report on disk.<br> I suggest you study it.<br> One of those things managed to wipe out<br> my entire crew in less than 24 hours.<br> If the colonists have found that ship, there's<br> no telling how many have been exposed.<br> Do you understand?<br> Anyway, we have it on disk, so look at it.<br> Any questions?<br> What is it, Private?<br> How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?<br> You secure that shit, Hudson.<br> All right.<br> Now listen up.<br> I want this thing to go smooth<br> and by the numbers.<br> I want DCS and tactical<br> database assimilation by 0830.<br> Ordnance loading, weapons strip and<br> drop-ship prep details. We have seven hours.<br> Now move it, people!<br> You heard the man, and you know the drill!<br> Assholes and elbows!<br> Hudson, come here. Come here!<br> I don't care if you are short, Hudson.<br> Get it done!<br> - Sarge, you'll get lip cancer smoking those!<br> - Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!<br> - How many more, Spunkmeyer?<br> - Last one.<br> Good. Take it away.<br> Clear behind.<br> Did you check number three?<br> Is this the non-op?<br> I feel like kind of a fifth wheel.<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> I don't know. Is there anything you can do?<br> Well, I can drive that loader.<br> I have a Class Two rating.<br> Be my guest.<br> Where you want it?<br> Bay twelve, please.<br> We're a team and<br> there's nothing to worry about.<br> We come here, and we gonna conquer, and<br> we gonna take some. Is that understood?<br> That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.<br> Gonna go and get some.<br> All right, people, on the ready-line!<br> - Are you lean?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Are you mean?<br> - Yeah!<br> - What are you?<br> - Lean, mean Marines!<br> Get on the ready-line! Get some today!<br> Get on the ready-line!<br> Move it out!<br> Move it out, goddamn it!<br> Get hot! One, two, three!<br> Get out! Get out! Get out!<br> Move it out! Move it out! Move it out!<br> One, two, three, four! One, two, three!<br> Absolutely badasses!<br> Let's pack 'em in! Get in there!<br> Move it!<br> - Let's go, let's go!<br> - One, two, three, four, five, six!<br> I want combat seating. You know your places.<br> Get those weapons stowed. Let's go!<br> Come on, settle down, people.<br> Lock 'em in, Hudson.<br> Ready to get it on? You know it!<br> OK, Bishop, let's go.<br> Roger.<br> I'm ready, man.<br> Ready to get it on! Go!<br> Stand by. Cross-locking now.<br> Pre-launch auto-cycle engaged.<br> Primary couplers released.<br> Hit the internals.<br> Confirm cross-lock<br> and drop stations secured.<br> Affirmative.<br> All drop stations secured.<br> Stand by. Ten seconds.<br> Stand by to initiate release sequencer.<br> On my mark.<br> We're on an express elevator to hell!<br> Going down!<br> Two, one, mark.<br> Whoo-hoo!<br> Switch to DCS ranging.<br> - 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.<br> - We're in the pipe. Five by five.<br> - We're picking up some hull ionisation.<br> - Got it. Rough air ahead.<br> We're in for some chop.<br> How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?<br> Simulated.<br> How many combat drops?<br> Uh, two...<br> ...including this one.<br> - Shit!<br> - Oh, man!<br> Range 0-1-4. Turning on final.<br> I got a bad feeling about this drop.<br> You always say<br> "I got a bad feeling about this drop".<br> OK, OK.<br> When we get back without you,<br> I'll call your folks.<br> All right. Let's see what we can see.<br> Everybody on-line. Looking good.<br> Drake, check your camera.<br> There seems to be a malfunction.<br> That's better.<br> Pan it around a bit. Good.<br> I'm ready, man. Check it out.<br> I am the ultimate badass!<br> State-of-the-badass-art!<br> You do not wanna fuck with me.<br> Check it out.<br> Hey, Ripley, don't worry.<br> Me and my squad of ultimate<br> badasses will protect you.<br> Check it out.<br> Independently targeting<br> particle-beam phalanx.<br> Whap!<br> Fry half a city with this puppy!<br> We got tactical smart missiles...<br> ...phase plasma pulse rifles, RPGs...<br> We got sonic electronic ballbreakers!<br> We got nukes.<br> We got knives, sharp sticks...<br> Knock it off, Hudson!<br> All right, gear up.<br> Two minutes, people. Get hot.<br> Somebody wake up Hicks.<br> - Coming around for a seven-zero-niner.<br> - Terminal guidance locked in.<br> Where's the damn beacon?<br> Oh, I see it.<br> - That's the atmosphere processor?<br> - Yep, that's it.<br> Remarkable piece of machinery.<br> Completely automated.<br> We manufacture those, by the way.<br> OK, Ferro.<br> Take us in low over the main colony complex.<br> Storm shutters are sealed.<br> There's no visible activity.<br> All right. Hold at forty.<br> - Roger.<br> - Give me a slow circle of the complex.<br> Structure seems intact.<br> They still have power.<br> OK, Ferro.<br> Set down on the landing grid.<br> Immediate dust-off on my clear,<br> then stay on station.<br> Down and clear.<br> Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!<br> I want a nice, clean dispersal this time.<br> Let's go! Move it out!<br> Head 'em out!<br> First squad up, on-line.<br> Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.<br> Vasquez, take point.<br> Let's move!<br> Move up.<br> Hudson, run a bypass.<br> Second squad, move up.<br> Flanking positions.<br> Second squad, on-line.<br> You set?<br> Go on.<br> Second team, move inside.<br> Hicks, take the upper level.<br> Sir, you copying this?<br> Looks like hits from small-arms fire.<br> We got some explosive damages,<br> probably seismic survey charges.<br> Are you reading this?<br> Keep it tight, people.<br> Hicks, Hudson,<br> use your motion trackers.<br> Nothing.<br> Not a goddamn thing.<br> Quarter and search by twos.<br> OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.<br> It's right in there.<br> - Now!<br> - Now!<br> Good one, Hudson!<br> Uh, sir, we have a negative situation here.<br> Uh, moving on, sir.<br> Wait, tell him to...<br> Hicks, back up.<br> Pan right.<br> There.<br> You seeing this?<br> Looks melted. Somebody must have<br> bagged one of Ripley's bad guys here.<br> Acid for blood.<br> If you liked that, you're gonna love this.<br> Quit screwing around.<br> Second squad, what's your status?<br> We just finished our sweep.<br> Nobody's home.<br> Roger. Sir, this place is dead.<br> Whatever happened here, we missed it.<br> The area's secured.<br> Let's go check their computer.<br> - It's not secure.<br> - The area's secured.<br> First team, head for Operations.<br> - Hudson, get their CPU on-line.<br> - Affirmative.<br> Hicks, meet me at the south lock.<br> We're coming in.<br> He's coming in. I feel safer already.<br> Pendejo jerkoff!<br> Sir, we got the CPU on-line.<br> No problem.<br> Good. Stand by in Operations.<br> OK, let's go.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yes.<br> Sir... They sealed off this wing at both ends.<br> Welded the doors, and blocked off<br> the stairs with heavy equipment.<br> But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.<br> - Any bodies?<br> - No, sir.<br> Last stand.<br> Must have been a hell of a fight.<br> Yeah, looks that way.<br> All right, Drake, this way. You should be able<br> to cut through the med lab to Operations.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Gorman.<br> Are those the same ones?<br> Careful, Burke.<br> Looks like love at first sight to me.<br> Oh, he likes you, Burke.<br> Two are alive. The rest are dead.<br> Surgically removed<br> before embryo implantation.<br> Subject: Marachuk, John J,<br> died during the procedure.<br> They killed him taking it off.<br> Yo, Hicks.<br> I think we got something here.<br> - Behind us.<br> - One of us?<br> Apone, where are your people?<br> - Anybody in D-Block?<br> - Negative. We're all in Operations.<br> - Talk to me, Frosty.<br> - Let's keep moving, baby.<br> - It's moving.<br> - Which way?<br> It's coming straight for us.<br> Straight up.<br> - Fuck!<br> - Hold up!<br> Ripley.<br> Hey... shh, it's all right.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Grab her, Corporal.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Come on. We won't hurt you.<br> Shh... it's all right. It's OK.<br> Come on out. Come on. Easy, easy.<br> I got her!<br> Ow! Damn!<br> - Don't let her go!<br> - She's under the grill!<br> - Frost, get your light up here.<br> - Where'd she go?<br> Shine the light!<br> Down here.<br> Here. Here.<br> Keep back. Don't scare her.<br> - Grab her, man! We're gonna lose her!<br> - Damn it!<br> Wait!<br> It's OK. It's all right.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> See?<br> Wait! No, you don't!<br> It's OK! You're gonna be all right now!<br> Shh!<br> Easy! Easy!<br> It's gonna be OK. It's all right.<br> You're gonna be OK.<br> Shh, shh, shh!<br> Easy.<br> Easy.<br> - What's her name again?<br> - Rebecca.<br> Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.<br> Just start at the beginning.<br> Where are your parents?<br> Look, Rebecca...<br> Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?<br> Total brainlock.<br> Physically she's OK. Borderline malnutrition,<br> but no permanent damage.<br> Come on. We're wasting our time.<br> Try this.<br> It's a little hot chocolate.<br> There you go.<br> Whoop.<br> That good, huh?<br> Uh-oh.<br> I made a clean spot here.<br> Now I've done it!<br> Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.<br> Hard to believe there's<br> a little girl under all this.<br> And a pretty one, too.<br> You don't talk much, do you?<br> - Smoking or non-smoking?<br> - Just tell me what you're scanning for.<br> PDT's. Personal data transmitters.<br> Every colonist had one surgically implanted.<br> If they're within 20 clicks,<br> we'll read it out here.<br> So far, zippo.<br> I don't know how you managed to stay alive,<br> but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.<br> Newt.<br> - What did you say?<br> - Newt.<br> My name's Newt.<br> Nobody calls me Rebecca...<br> ...except my brother.<br> Newt.<br> I like that.<br> I'm Ripley.<br> It's nice to meet you.<br> And who is this? Hm?<br> Casey.<br> Hello, Casey.<br> What about your brother? What's his name?<br> Timmy.<br> Is Timmy around here, too?<br> Maybe hiding like you were?<br> Any sisters?<br> Mom and Dad?<br> Newt, look at me.<br> - Where are they?<br> - They're dead, all right? Can I go now?<br> I'm sorry, Newt.<br> Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?<br> These people are here to protect you.<br> They're soldiers.<br> It won't make any difference.<br> Need anything else?<br> Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?<br> No.<br> Nice pet you got there.<br> Magnificent, isn't it?<br> Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!<br> Found 'em.<br> They alive?<br> Unknown, but it looks like all of 'em...<br> ...over at the processing station...<br> ...sub-level three...<br> ...under the main cooling towers.<br> It looks like a goddamn town meeting.<br> Let's saddle up, Apone.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Let's go, people.<br> They ain't payin' us by the hour.<br> Head 'em out!<br> OK, Frost, you're driving.<br> It's OK. Don't worry. It'll be OK.<br> I want a straight Vdeployment.<br> Second team on left flank.<br> Advance on axial six-six-four.<br> Tracker on-line.<br> Set the V-gain to filter R-F ambient.<br> Hudson, tracker on-line.<br> Left and right, little buddy.<br> 40 metres in, bearing two-two-one,<br> there should be a stairwell.<br> Check. Got it.<br> You want sub-level three.<br> Let's go, people. Hudson,<br> you got the point. Hicks, watch our tails.<br> Nice and easy. Check those corners.<br> Check those corners.<br> Watch your spacing.<br> You heard the man. Don't bunch up.<br> Your transmission's showing break-up.<br> Probably getting<br> interference from the structure.<br> Use those lights.<br> Next one down,<br> and proceed on a two-one-six.<br> Roger, that's a two-one-six.<br> I'm not making that out too well.<br> What is it, Hudson?<br> You tell me, man. I only work here.<br> What is that?<br> I don't know.<br> Proceed inside.<br> Watch your fire<br> and check your targets.<br> Remember we're looking for civvies in here.<br> Easy.<br> Tighten it up, Frost.<br> We're getting a little thin.<br> Nice and easy.<br> Looks like some sort of secreted resin.<br> Yeah... but secreted from what?<br> Nobody touch nothing.<br> Busy little creatures, huh?<br> - Hot as hell in here.<br> - Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.<br> Knock it off, Hudson.<br> - Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?<br> - Ten-millimetre explosive-tip caseless.<br> - Standard light armour-piercing round. Why?<br> - Look where your team is.<br> They're right under<br> the primary heat exchangers.<br> So?<br> So, if they fire their weapons in there,<br> won't they rupture the cooling system?<br> - Yeah. She's absolutely right.<br> - So what?<br> This whole station is basically<br> a big fusion reactor.<br> Right?<br> So she's talking about a thermonuclear<br> explosion and "Adis, muchachos".<br> Oh, great. Wonderful.<br> Shit!<br> Look.<br> Uh... Apone.<br> Look.<br> We can't have any firing in there. I want<br> you to collect magazines from everybody.<br> - Is he fuckin' crazy?<br> - What do we use? Harsh language?<br> - Flame units only.<br> - Sir, I...<br> Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.<br> All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.<br> Let's have 'em.<br> Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.<br> Damn!<br> You, too. Give it up, Ski.<br> Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.<br> Right on, Vas.<br> Let's go, Marine. Give it up.<br> Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.<br> - Thanks a lot, Sarge.<br> - Hicks, cover our ass.<br> Head 'em out, people.<br> I like to keep this handy,<br> for close encounters.<br> I heard that.<br> Any movement?<br> Nothing. Zip.<br> Holy shit!<br> Newt, go sit up front.<br> Go on!<br> Now!<br> Steady, people.<br> Let's finish our sweep.<br> We're still Marines, and we got a job to do.<br> Keep it moving.<br> Easy.<br> - Top!<br> - What?<br> We got a live one!<br> - You're gonna be all right.<br> - Please... kill me.<br> Stay calm. We'll get you out.<br> It's gonna be all right.<br> - We've got to get her out!<br> - What is it, Dietrich?<br> Convulsion!<br> Ohh!<br> Dietrich, get back! Get back!<br> Aagh!<br> Aagh!<br> No!<br> Frost, flamethrower!<br> Get back! Flamethrower! Move!<br> Movement!<br> What's the position?<br> I can't lock in!<br> Talk to me, Hudson!<br> Multiple signals!<br> They're closing!<br> Go to infrared, people.<br> Look sharp!<br> What's happening, Apone?<br> We can't see anything in here.<br> Pull your team out, Gorman.<br> I got readings in front and behind!<br> Where, man?<br> I don't see shit.<br> He's right. There's nothing back here.<br> Something's moving and it ain't us!<br> Shit!<br> Tracker's off-scale, man.<br> They're all around us, man! Jesus!<br> Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.<br> Aagh!<br> Aagh!<br> Frost!<br> Aagh!<br> Come on!<br> Aagh!<br> Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on!<br> Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!<br> Dietrich! Crowe! Sound off!<br> Frost!<br> Frost!<br> Wierzbowski!<br> Wierzbowski!<br> Let's rock!<br> Yeah!<br> Who's firing? Goddamn it!<br> I ordered a "hold fire".<br> They're coming out of<br> the goddamn walls in swarms!<br> Uh, Apone, I want you to lay down<br> a suppressing fire with...<br> Vasquez! Drake! Hold your fire!<br> Are you copying me?<br> Lay down a suppressing fire...<br> ...with the incinerators,<br> and fall back by squads.<br> Say again? All after incinerators.<br> Lay down a suppressing fire<br> with the incinerators, and fall back...<br> Aagh!<br> Sarge!<br> Apone...<br> ...talk to me.<br> Apone?<br> - Talk to me!<br> - He's gone!<br> Get them out of there! Now!<br> - Shut up!<br> - Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell...<br> - Shut up!<br> - Goddamn it!<br> Where's Apone?! Where's Apone?!<br> The Sarge is gone!<br> Let's get the fuck out of here!<br> Let's go, Marines!<br> Hudson?<br> Vasquez?<br> - Hudson, look out!<br> - Get it!<br> Hudson!<br> - Hicks! Hicks!<br> - It's too much! Fall back!<br> I told them to fall back.<br> - I told them to fall back.<br> - They're cut off!<br> Do something!<br> Fuck!<br> Keep movin'!<br> Hold on, Newt.<br> Ripley, what the hell are you doing!<br> Turn around!<br> That's an order!<br> - Get off me!<br> - Goddamn it, that's an order!<br> You had your chance, Gorman.<br> Come on!<br> Come on, Drake!<br> Let's move it!<br> Come on! Let's go! Let's go!<br> It's blocked, man!<br> We got to go around!<br> Open the door! Hicks!<br> Drake! We are leaving!<br> Get them, Vas!<br> Run for it!<br> Shit!<br> - Let's go!<br> - Drake, come on, man!<br> Drake, come on!<br> Aagh!<br> - Aaaghhh!<br> - No!<br> Fire in the hold!<br> - He's gone!<br> - No! Drake's out there!<br> Put it out!<br> Drake's coming!<br> He's gone!<br> No, he's... not!<br> Forget him! He's gone!<br> Get on the goddamn door!<br> Eat this!<br> Aagh!<br> Ripley! Go, go, go!<br> Whoa!<br> Oh!<br> It's all right! We're clear!<br> Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!<br> You're just grinding metal!<br> Come on, ease down.<br> Ease down.<br> Ease down!<br> Ease down.<br> You OK?<br> I'm all right.<br> Get away from me, man!<br> - Lieutenant.<br> - What happened to Gorman?<br> I don't know... Maybe a concussion.<br> - But he's alive.<br> - No, man, he's dead!<br> - Wake up, pendejo! I'm gonna kill you!<br> - Back off!<br> Right now.<br> Somebody get me a first-aid kit.<br> Hey. Hey, look!<br> The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.<br> Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.<br> - Then we go back in there and get them.<br> - I ain't going back!<br> You can't help them!<br> You can't. Right now they're<br> being cocooned just like the others.<br> Oh, dear Lord Jesus,<br> this ain't happenin', man.<br> This can't be happenin', man.<br> This isn't happenin'!<br> We've got seven canisters of CN-20.<br> I say we roll them in there<br> and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.<br> It's worth a try, but we<br> don't know if it'll affect 'em.<br> Let's bug out and call it even.<br> Why even talk about it?<br> I say we take off and<br> nuke the entire site from orbit.<br> It's the only way to be sure.<br> - Fuckin' A!<br> - Hold on one second.<br> This installation has a substantial<br> dollar value attached to it.<br> They can bill me.<br> OK, look.<br> This is an emotional moment<br> for all of us, OK? I know that.<br> But let's not make snap judgments, please.<br> This is clearly an important species<br> we're dealing with...<br> ...and I don't think anybody<br> has the right to arbitrarily...<br> ...exterminate them.<br> - Wrong.<br> Yeah. Watch us.<br> Maybe you aren't up on current events,<br> but we just got our asses kicked, pal!<br> Look, I'm not blind to what's going on...<br> ...but I cannot authorise that kind of action.<br> Well, I believe Corporal Hicks<br> has authority here.<br> Corporal Hicks is...<br> This operation is under military jurisdiction.<br> Hicks is next in chain of command.<br> Am I right, Corporal?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> Yeah. Look, Ripley, this is<br> a multimillion-dollar installation, OK?<br> He can't make that decision. He's just a grunt.<br> No offence.<br> None taken.<br> - Ferro, do you copy?<br> - Standing by.<br> - Prep for dust-off. We need immediate evac.<br> - Roger. On our way.<br> I say we take off... nuke the site from orbit.<br> It's the only way to be sure.<br> Let's do it.<br> Let's go! Pick it up, Hudson.<br> Pick it up, baby.<br> All right. Set him down here.<br> Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.<br> Hold on a second. There's something...<br> Just get up here.<br> I'm in. Ramp closing.<br> Spunkmeyer.<br> Goddamn it.<br> Well, where the fuck...<br> Run!<br> Well, that's great.<br> That's just fuckin' great, man.<br> Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?<br> We're in some real pretty shit now, man!<br> Are you finished?<br> You all right?<br> I guess we're not<br> gonna be leaving now, right?<br> I'm sorry, Newt.<br> You don't have to be sorry.<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> That's it, man. Game over, man! Game over!<br> What the fuck are we gonna do now?<br> What are we gonna do?!<br> Maybe we could build a fire, sing<br> a couple of songs. Why don't we try that?<br> We'd better get back cos it'll be dark soon,<br> and they mostly come at night.<br> Mostly.<br> That's everything, right?<br> This is absolutely everything<br> we could salvage out of the APC wreckage.<br> We got four pulse rifles<br> with about 50 rounds each.<br> That ain't so good.<br> We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.<br> Don't touch that.<br> Dangerous, honey.<br> - Is that the only flamethrower?<br> - Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.<br> And another one's damaged.<br> I don't know about that one.<br> But the good news...<br> We got four of these robot sentries...<br> ...with display and scanners intact.<br> They really kick ass. They'll come in handy.<br> How long after we're declared overdue<br> can we expect a rescue?<br> Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,<br> but we're not gonna last 17 hours!<br> Those things are gonna come in here<br> like they did before, and...<br> Hudson! Hudson!<br> This little girl survived longer than that<br> with no weapons and no training.<br> Right?<br> - Why don't you put her in charge?<br> - You better start dealing with it, Hudson.<br> Listen to me.<br> Deal with it, because we need you...<br> ...and I'm sick of your bullshit.<br> Now get on a terminal and call up<br> a floor-plan file. Do you understand?<br> Construction blueprints. Anything that<br> shows the layout. Are you listening?<br> Yeah.<br> I need to see air ducts, electrical<br> access tunnels, sub-basements...<br> ...every possible way into this complex.<br> We don't have much time.<br> OK.<br> - OK, I'm on it.<br> - Hudson...<br> Just relax.<br> I'll be in med lab.<br> I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.<br> Fine.<br> You do that.<br> So this service tunnel must be<br> how they're moving back and forth.<br> Right. It moves from the processing<br> station right into the sub-level here.<br> Come down on that.<br> OK, come over.<br> Hold it. Go back.<br> OK, punch that in right there.<br> - No. It's back here.<br> - OK.<br> Well, there's a pressure door at this end.<br> Couldn't we put a remote<br> sentry unit in the tunnel...<br> ...and then seal that door?<br> - But we gotta figure on them getting in.<br> That's right, so...<br> ...we repair the barricades<br> at these two intersections...<br> ...and weld plate steel<br> over these ducts here, and here...<br> ...and here.<br> Then they can only come at us<br> from these two corridors.<br> Right. Then we put<br> the other sentry units here...<br> ...and here. Right?<br> - Right.<br> - Outstanding.<br> Now all we need is a deck of cards.<br> All right, let's move<br> like we've got a purpose.<br> - Affirmative.<br> - Affirmative.<br> Do your thing, baby.<br> Vasquez, let's get the hell out of here.<br> - A and B sentries are in place and keyed.<br> - Roger.<br> Stand by. Arming now.<br> Test it, Hudson.<br> - Do it!<br> - Fire in the hole!<br> OK! Let's get the hell out of here!<br> We're sealing the tunnel!<br> Come on, baby.<br> For what it's worth...<br> Here, I want you to put this on.<br> What's it for?<br> It's a locator. Then I can find you<br> anywhere in the complex... on this.<br> It's just a precaution.<br> Thanks.<br> Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.<br> All right, what's next?<br> Last stop.<br> Get in.<br> Scoot down.<br> That's good.<br> Now you lie here and have a nap.<br> You're very tired.<br> I don't want to. I have scary dreams.<br> Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.<br> Let's take a look.<br> Nope. Nothing bad in there.<br> See?<br> Maybe you could just try to be like her.<br> Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...<br> ...because she's just a piece of plastic.<br> Right.<br> I'm sorry, Newt.<br> There.<br> My mommy always said there<br> were no monsters. No real ones.<br> But there are.<br> Yes, there are, aren't there?<br> Why do they tell little kids that?<br> Most of the time it's true.<br> Did one of those things grow inside her?<br> I don't know, Newt.<br> That's the truth.<br> Isn't that how babies come?<br> I mean, people babies?<br> - They grow inside you.<br> - No. That's very different.<br> Did you ever have a baby?<br> Yes, I did.<br> I had a little girl.<br> Where is she?<br> She's gone.<br> You mean dead.<br> Here.<br> Take this.<br> For luck.<br> How's that?<br> Don't go! Please!<br> Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.<br> And you see that camera?<br> I can see you through that camera...<br> ...all the time, to see if you're safe.<br> I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.<br> I mean that.<br> That's a promise.<br> You promise?<br> I cross my heart.<br> And hope to die?<br> And hope to die.<br> Now go to sleep...<br> ...and don't dream.<br> Sneak.<br> The molecular acid oxidises after the<br> creature's death, completely neutralising.<br> Bishop, that's interesting,<br> but it gets us nowhere.<br> I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing<br> with here. Let's go through it again.<br> They grab the colonists and immobilise them<br> to be hosts for more of these.<br> So there would have to be<br> a lot of these parasites.<br> One for each colonist.<br> A hundred at least.<br> Yes, that follows.<br> Each one of these things<br> comes from an egg, right?<br> So who's laying these eggs?<br> I'm not sure.<br> It must be something we haven't seen yet.<br> Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.<br> - Bees, man. Bees have hives.<br> - You know what I mean.<br> There's, like, one female<br> that runs the whole show.<br> - Yes. The queen.<br> - Yeah, the mama.<br> And she's badass, man. I mean big.<br> - These things ain't ants.<br> - I know that!<br> Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed<br> as soon as you're finished with them.<br> Mr Burke said they were to be kept alive<br> in stasis for return to the company labs.<br> He was very specific about it.<br> Those two specimens are worth millions<br> to the bio-weapons division.<br> If you're smart, we can both<br> come out of this heroes...<br> ...and we will be set up for life.<br> You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?<br> You really think you can get a dangerous<br> organism like that past ICC quarantine?<br> How can they impound it<br> if they don't know about it?<br> But they will know about it, Burke. From me.<br> Just like they'll know you were responsible<br> for the deaths of 157 colonists.<br> - Wait a second!<br> - You sent them to that ship.<br> I just checked the colony log: Directive<br> dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.<br> You sent them out there<br> and you didn't even warn them.<br> What if that ship didn't even exist?<br> Did you think about that? I didn't know.<br> So now if I make a major security situation<br> out of it, everybody steps in...<br> ...and there's no exclusive rights<br> for anybody. Nobody wins.<br> So I made a decision and it was wrong.<br> It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.<br> Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!<br> Have you any idea what you've done here!<br> I'm gonna make sure<br> they nail you right to the wall.<br> You won't sleaze your way out of this one.<br> Right to the wall.<br> Ripley.<br> You know, I expected more from you.<br> I thought you'd be smarter than this.<br> I'm happy to disappoint you.<br> What is it? What's going on?<br> - They're coming.<br> - Where?<br> In the tunnel.<br> Here we go.<br> A and B gun tracking and firing.<br> Multiple targets.<br> Look at those ammo counters go.<br> B gun's down 50 per cent.<br> It's a shooting gallery down there!<br> B gun's dry. 20 on A.<br> Ten...<br> ...five...<br> That's it.<br> Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.<br> They're at the pressure door.<br> Man, listen to that.<br> Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.<br> Well, that's a switch!<br> It's very pretty, Bishop,<br> but what are we looking for?<br> That's it. Emergency venting.<br> That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.<br> How long till it blows?<br> Four hours...<br> ...with a blast radius of 30 kilometres,<br> equal to about 40 megatons.<br> - We got problems.<br> - I don't fuckin' believe this!<br> Vasquez, close the shutters.<br> Why can't we shut it down from here?<br> The crash caused too much damage.<br> An overload was inevitable at this point.<br> Oh, man! And I was getting short!<br> Four more weeks and out.<br> - Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!<br> - Give us a break!<br> Four more weeks. Oh, man!<br> We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco.<br> Can't we bring it down on remote?<br> How? The transmitter was on the APC!<br> It's wasted!<br> I don't care how,<br> but we'd better think of something!<br> Think of what?!<br> We're fucked! We're doomed!<br> Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?<br> The uplink tower at the other end?<br> The hard-wiring between<br> here and there was damaged.<br> We can't align the dish.<br> Somebody has to go out there. Take<br> a portable terminal and patch in manually.<br> Oh, yeah, sure! With those things<br> running around? You can count me out.<br> - We can count you out of everything.<br> - I'll go.<br> - Why don't you go, man?<br> - I'll go.<br> - What?<br> - I'll go.<br> I'm the only one qualified<br> to remote-pilot the ship.<br> Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.<br> Good idea!<br> Believe me, I'd prefer not to.<br> I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.<br> How long?<br> This conduit runs almost<br> to the uplink assembly. 180 metres.<br> - Say 40 minutes to crawl down there...<br> - Right.<br> ...an hour to patch in and align the antenna...<br> ...30 minutes to prep the ship,<br> and about 50 minutes flight time.<br> It's gonna be close.<br> - Good luck.<br> - See you soon.<br> Watch your fingers.<br> Vaya con Dios, man.<br> This is unbelievable!<br> How many?<br> Can't tell. Lots.<br> D gun's down 50 per cent.<br> C gun's right behind it.<br> It ain't stopping 'em.<br> It ain't stopping 'em!<br> 150 rounds on D.<br> Come on, baby. Come on!<br> Come on, come on!<br> D gun's down to 20.<br> Ten.<br> Damn it!<br> Wait!<br> They're retreating.<br> The guns stopped them.<br> You're right.<br> Next time they walk right up and knock.<br> Yeah, but they don't know that.<br> They're probably looking<br> for other ways to get in.<br> That'll take 'em a while.<br> - Maybe we got 'em demoralised.<br> - Shut up.<br> I want you two walking perimeter.<br> Move!<br> Hey, listen.<br> We're all in strung-out shape...<br> ...but stay frosty...<br> ...and alert.<br> We can't afford to let<br> one of those bastards in here.<br> All right. Vmonos.<br> How long's it been since you got any sleep?<br> Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.<br> You'll take care of it, won't you?<br> If it comes to that, I'll do us both.<br> Let's just make sure<br> it doesn't come to that, all right?<br> All right.<br> Hey, I want to introduce you<br> to a personal friend of mine.<br> This is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimetre...<br> ...with an over-and-under 30 millimetre<br> pump-action grenade launcher.<br> Feel the weight.<br> OK. What do I do?<br> Pull it in tight here.<br> - Right.<br> - Lean into it.<br> All right, now it will kick some.<br> When the counter reads zero here, you...<br> - I press this up?<br> - That's right.<br> Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.<br> - Right.<br> - Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.<br> - What's this?<br> - The grenade launcher.<br> I don't think you want to mess with that.<br> You started this. Show me everything.<br> I can handle myself.<br> Yeah, I noticed.<br> How do you feel?<br> All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.<br> - Look, Ripley, I just want...<br> - Forget it. Excuse me.<br> Shh, shh, shh.<br> It's OK. It's OK.<br> Newt. Wake up.<br> - What?<br> - Be quiet.<br> We're in trouble.<br> Agh!<br> Move, Newt!<br> Hey!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Hicks!<br> Say again, Bishop?<br> You've got it into auto-refuel mode<br> and it's sequencing right?<br> That's right.<br> Good. Stay on it.<br> Get back to me when you've<br> activated the launch cycle.<br> - He's at the uplink tower.<br> - Terrific.<br> - Hicks! Hicks!<br> - Help! Help!<br> Hicks! Help us!<br> Break the glass!<br> Break it, break it!<br> I'll try.<br> Ripley, I'm scared.<br> Me, too.<br> Stay here.<br> It's the med lab. Hudson!<br> Vasquez! Meet me in med lab! We got a fire!<br> We're on our way.<br> They're coming, Newt.<br> Urgh!<br> Aagh!<br> Shoot it out!<br> - Hudson!<br> - Jesus!<br> Oh!<br> Christ, kid, look out!<br> - Over there!<br> - Yeah!<br> - Ready?<br> - Yeah!<br> Hudson!<br> Yeah, all clear. Nailed the other one.<br> It's history, man.<br> Jesus!<br> Burke. It was Burke.<br> I say we grease this rat-fuck<br> son of a bitch right now.<br> It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.<br> He figured that he could get an alien<br> back through quarantine...<br> ...if one of us was impregnated.<br> Whatever you call it.<br> And then frozen for the trip home.<br> Nobody would know about<br> the embryos we were carrying...<br> ...me and Newt.<br> Wait, now. We'd all know.<br> Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging<br> certain freezers on the way home.<br> Namely, yours.<br> Then he could jettison the bodies<br> and make up any story he liked.<br> Fuck! He's dead.<br> You're dog meat, pal.<br> This is so nuts. I mean, listen...<br> Listen to what you're saying.<br> It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.<br> It's pathetic.<br> Burke, I don't know which species is worse.<br> They don't fuck each other over<br> for a goddamn percentage.<br> All right, we waste him. No offence.<br> No! He's got to go back...<br> They cut the power.<br> How can they cut the power?<br> They're animals!<br> I want you two checking the corridors! Move!<br> Gorman, watch Burke.<br> Newt, stay close.<br> - I'll go this side.<br> - You do that, man.<br> - Anything?<br> - There's something.<br> It's inside the complex.<br> You're just reading me.<br> No, it ain't you.<br> They're inside the perimeter. They're in here.<br> Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?<br> Hudson may be right.<br> - Get back, both of you.<br> - The signal's weird.<br> Must be some interference or something.<br> There's movement all over the place!<br> Get back to Operations. It's game time.<br> Newt.<br> Seal the door.<br> Hurry!<br> Come on! Come on, get back!<br> Work fast.<br> Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.<br> Movement. Signal's clean. Range: 20 metres.<br> They found a way in, something we missed.<br> We didn't miss anything.<br> Something under the floor, not in the plans.<br> - 15 metres.<br> - Ripley!<br> Definitely inside the barricades.<br> Let's go!<br> - That's right outside the door. Get back!<br> - This is a big fuckin' signal.<br> - How you doing, Vasquez?<br> - Almost there.<br> That's it.<br> - They're right on us.<br> - 9 metres.<br> - Remember, short controlled bursts.<br> - 8 metres.<br> - That can't be!<br> - It's reading right, man!<br> You're not reading it right.<br> What the hell!<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - Give me the light!<br> There they go! Get 'em!<br> - Come on!<br> - Get 'em!<br> Do something, Gorman!<br> Look out! Look out!<br> There's more of 'em!<br> Get to medical!<br> Do it! Now!<br> Hudson! Look out!<br> Aagh!<br> Now!<br> Burke!<br> Open this door! Burke! Open it!<br> Agh!<br> Let's go! Let's go! Fall back!<br> Go!<br> Die, motherfucker!<br> Burke!<br> Hudson!<br> Hudson!<br> Motherfucker!<br> Come on! Come on! Come and get it, baby!<br> I don't got all day! Come on, you bastard!<br> Come on, you too!<br> You want some of this? Fuck you!<br> Aagh!<br> Fuck you!<br> - Hicks!<br> - Hudson!<br> Come on, Hicks!<br> Go!<br> It's locked!<br> Got it! Let's go!<br> Go! Go!<br> Move, Gorman!<br> Seal it!<br> Burke!<br> Goddamn you! Open this door!<br> Get back!<br> - Hurry up!<br> - Gorman, get out of the way!<br> - Ripley, this way!<br> - What?<br> Wait. Get behind me.<br> Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!<br> - Hicks!<br> - Come on, let's go!<br> Move!<br> - Which way to the landing field?<br> - This way.<br> Go right!<br> This way! This way.<br> - Which way?<br> - Straight ahead and left.<br> Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.<br> The ship is on its way.<br> ETA 16 minutes.<br> Good! Stand by there! We're on our way!<br> - Which way now?<br> - That way.<br> - No, wait! This way!<br> - Are you sure?<br> Vasquez, move!<br> - Right up here! It's just up here!<br> - Hicks!<br> We're almost there!<br> Newt, wait!<br> Newt!<br> Vasquez!<br> Go!<br> Ohh! Ohh, no!<br> Newt!<br> Up there!<br> There's a short cut across the roof!<br> Hicks!<br> You always were an asshole, Gorman.<br> Newt!<br> - Ripley!<br> - Newt!<br> Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!<br> Oh! Hold on, Newt!<br> - I'm slipping!<br> - Don't let go!<br> - Ripley!<br> - Hold on!<br> - Help!<br> - Gotcha!<br> I gotcha!<br> Newt! No!<br> Come on! We can find her with this!<br> Stay where you are, Newt!<br> - Ripley!<br> - We're coming!<br> Ripley!<br> This way.<br> She's close.<br> Newt!<br> Ripley!<br> Where are you! Can you hear me!<br> - Newt!<br> - Here! I'm here!<br> Where?!<br> Newt, are you OK?<br> Gonna have to cut it.<br> Climb down, honey.<br> We've got to cut through.<br> Newt?<br> Now don't move. Stay very still.<br> OK.<br> We're almost there. Hang in there, OK?<br> Hicks! Hurry!<br> - I know!<br> - I mean it!<br> Newt, just stay still!<br> Aagh!<br> - Almost there!<br> - No!<br> Newt!<br> No! No!<br> - Let's go!<br> - No!<br> They don't kill you!<br> They don't kill you! They...<br> - She's alive! She's alive!<br> - All right! I believe you! She's alive!<br> We've got to go! Now!<br> Hicks...<br> Get it off!<br> Aagh!<br> Get it off!<br> Aagh!<br> Here!<br> Go!<br> Come on, you can make it!<br> Bishop! How much time?!<br> Plenty! 26 minutes!<br> - We're not leaving!<br> - We're not?<br> - Ripley...<br> - Bishop, she's alive. There's still time.<br> In 19 minutes this area<br> is gonna be a cloud of vapour.<br> - Hicks, don't let him leave.<br> - We ain't going anywhere.<br> - See you, Hicks.<br> - Dwayne.<br> It's Dwayne.<br> Ellen.<br> Don't be gone long, Ellen.<br> Attention. Emergency.<br> All personnel must evacuate immediately.<br> You now have 15 minutes<br> to reach minimum safe distance.<br> Attention. Emergency.<br> All personnel must evacuate immediately.<br> You now have 14 minutes<br> to reach minimum safe distance.<br> Ripley!<br> Ripley!<br> Grab on to me!<br> Hold on!<br> Let's go!<br> Behind us!<br> Attention. Emergency.<br> All personnel must evacuate immediately.<br> Attention. Emergency.<br> All personnel must evacuate immediately.<br> You now have four minutes<br> to reach minimum safe distance.<br> Come on, goddamn it!<br> Hold on to me!<br> Attention. Emergency.<br> All personnel must evacuate immediately.<br> You now have two minutes<br> to reach minimum safe distance.<br> No!<br> Bishop!<br> Goddamn you!<br> Close your eyes, baby.<br> Look!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Punch it, Bishop!<br> It's OK.<br> We're OK.<br> Hey.<br> We made it.<br> I knew you'd come.<br> He's gonna be all right.<br> He's just out. I had to give him<br> another shot for the pain.<br> We need a stretcher<br> to carry him up to medical.<br> OK.<br> I'm sorry if I scared you.<br> That platform was becoming too unstable.<br> I had to circle and hope that things<br> didn't get too rough to take you off.<br> Bishop...<br> - You did OK.<br> - I did?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Go! Move!<br> No! Here! Here!<br> Run!<br> Here!<br> Get away from her, you bitch!<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Aagh!<br> Aagh!<br> Aagh!<br> Ripley!<br> Ohh!<br> Aagh!<br> Bishop!<br> - Mommy!<br> - Oh, God!<br> Not bad for a... human.<br> Are we gonna sleep all the way home?<br> All the way home.<br> Can I dream?<br> Yes, honey. I think we both can.<br> Sleep tight.<br> Affirmative.<br>
