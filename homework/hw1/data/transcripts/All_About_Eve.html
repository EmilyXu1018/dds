                        (narrator) The Sarah Siddons Award<br> is perhaps unknown to you.<br> It has been spared<br> the sensational publicity<br> of such questionable honors<br> as the Pulitzer Prize<br> and those awards presented annually<br> by that film society.<br> The distinguished-looking gentleman<br> is an extremely old actor.<br> Being an actor,<br> he will go on speaking for some time.<br> It is not important<br> that you hear what he says.<br> However, it is important that you know<br> where you are and why you are here.<br> This is the dining hall<br> of the Sarah Siddons Society.<br> It is the annual banquet and presentation<br> of the highest honor our theatre has:<br> the Sarah Siddons Award for<br> Distinguished Achievement.<br> These hallowed walls,<br> indeed many of these faces,<br> have looked upon Modjeska,<br> Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.<br> Mansfield's voice filled this room.<br> It is unlikely that the windows<br> have been opened since his death.<br> The minor awards, as you can see,<br> have already been presented.<br> Minor awards are for such<br> as the writer and director,<br> since they merely construct a tower<br> so that the world can applaud<br> a light which flashes on top of it.<br> And no brighter light has ever<br> dazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.<br> Eve... But more of Eve later.<br> All about Eve, in fact.<br> To those who do not read,<br> attend the theatre,<br> listen to unsponsored radio programs<br> or know anything of the world<br> in which you live,<br> it is perhaps necessary<br> to introduce myself.<br> My name is Addison DeWitt.<br> My native habitat is the theatre.<br> In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.<br> I am a critic and commentator.<br> I am essential to the theatre.<br> This is Karen Richards.<br> She is the wife of a playwright,<br> therefore of the theatre by marriage.<br> Nothing in her background should have<br> brought her closer to the stage<br> than Row E.<br> However,<br> during her senior year at Radcliffe,<br> Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.<br> The following year<br> Karen became Mrs. Lloyd Richards.<br> There are, in general,<br> two types of theatrical producers.<br> One has a great many wealthy friends<br> who will risk a tax-deductible loss.<br> This type is interested in art.<br> The other is one to whom each production<br> means potential ruin or fortune.<br> This type is out to make a buck.<br> Meet Max Fabian.<br> He is the producer of the play<br> which has won for Eve Harrington<br> the Sarah Siddons Award.<br> Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.<br> She made her first stage appearance at<br> the age of four<br> in Midsummer Night's Dream.<br> She played a fairy and entered,<br> quite unexpectedly, stark naked.<br> She has been a star ever since.<br> Margo is a great star. A true star.<br> She never was or will be<br> anything less or anything else.<br> Having covered in tedious detail not only<br> the history of the Sarah Siddons Society,<br> but also the history of acting<br> since Thespis<br> first stepped out of the chorus line,<br> our distinguished chairman has finally<br> arrived at our reason for being here.<br> I have been proud and privileged<br> to have spent my life in the theatre,<br> a poor player that struts<br> and frets his hour upon the stage,<br> and I've been honored to be, for 40 years,<br> chief prompter<br> of the Sarah Siddons Society.<br> this highest honor the theatre knows.<br> Surely no actor is older than I.<br> I've earned my place out of the sun.<br> (laughter)<br> And never before has this award gone to<br> anyone younger than its recipient tonight.<br> How fitting that it should<br> pass from my hands to hers.<br> Such young hands. Such a young lady.<br> Young in years, but whose heart<br> is as old as the theatre.<br> Some of us are privileged to know her.<br> We have seen<br> beyond the beauty and artistry<br> that have made her name<br> resound through the nation.<br> We know her humility, her devotion,<br> her loyalty to her art,<br> her love, her deep and abiding love for us,<br> for what we are<br> and what we do, the theatre.<br> She has had one wish,<br> one prayer, one dream,<br> to belong to us.<br> Tonight her dream has come true,<br> and henceforth<br> we shall dream the same of her.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguished<br> achievement in the theatre,<br> the Sarah Siddons Award<br> to Miss Eve Harrington.<br> Bravo!<br> (Addison) Eve.<br> Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.<br> The girl next door, the girl on the moon.<br> Time has been good to Eve.<br> Life goes where she goes. She's been<br> profiled, covered, revealed, reported,<br> what she eats and what<br> she wears and whom she knows<br> and where she was and<br> when and where she's going.<br> Eve.<br> You all know all about Eve.<br> What can there be to know<br> that you don't know?<br> (Karen) When was it? How long?<br> It seems a lifetime ago.<br> Lloyd always said that in the theatre<br> a lifetime was a season<br> and a season a lifetime.<br> It's June now. That was early October.<br> Only last October.<br> It was a drizzly night.<br> I remember I asked the taxi to wait.<br> Where was she?<br> Strange. I'd become so accustomed<br> to seeing her there night after night,<br> I found myself looking for a girl<br> I'd never spoken to.<br> Wondering where she was.<br> Mrs. Richards?<br> There you are.<br> It seemed odd, suddenly,<br> your not being here.<br> -Why should you think I wouldn't be?<br> -Why should you be?<br> Six nights a week for weeks<br> of watching even Margo Channing<br> enter and leave a theatre.<br> -You don't mind my speaking to you?<br> -Not at all.<br> I've seen you so often.<br> It took every bit of courage I could raise.<br> To speak to just a playwright's wife?<br> I'm the lowest form of celebrity.<br> You're Margo Channing's best friend.<br> You and your husband are always with her.<br> And Mr. Sampson. What's he like?<br> Bill Sampson? He's a director.<br> -He's the best.<br> -He'll agree with you.<br> Tell me. What do you do in between<br> the time Margo goes in and comes out?<br> Just huddle in that doorway and wait?<br> Oh, no. I see the play.<br> You see the play? You've seen<br> every performance of this play?<br> Yes.<br> But don't you find it...<br> Apart from everything else,<br> don't you find it expensive?<br> Standing room doesn't cost much.<br> I manage.<br> -I'm gonna take you to Margo.<br> -Oh, no!<br> -Oh, yes. She's got to meet you.<br> -No, I'd be imposing on her.<br> I'd be just another tongue-tied fan.<br> There isn't another like you.<br> There couldn't be.<br> If I'd known... Some other time.<br> Looking like this.<br> You look just fine.<br> By the way, what's your name?<br> Eve. Eve Harrington.<br> -Good evening, Gus.<br> -Good evening, Mrs. Richards.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night, Gus.<br> You can breathe it, can't you?<br> Like some magic perfume.<br> (laughter from behind the door)<br> Wait right here. Don't run away.<br> "If the South had won,<br> you could write plays about the North."<br> -Hi.<br> -Hello!<br> "I don't think<br> you can rightly say we lost the war."<br> "We was more starved out,<br> you might say."<br> "I don't understand all these plays<br> about love-starved Southern women."<br> "Love is one thing we were<br> never starved for in the South."<br> Margo's interview with<br> a reporter from the South.<br> When it gets printed, they're<br> gonna fire on Gettysburg again.<br> -It was Fort Sumter they fired on.<br> -I never played Fort Sumter.<br> Honeychild had a point.<br> Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.<br> Write me one about a nice, normal woman<br> who just shoots her husband.<br> -You need new girdles.<br> -Buy some.<br> -Same size?<br> -Of course.<br> I find these wisecracks<br> increasingly less funny.<br> -Aged in Wood happens to be a fine play.<br> -That's my loyal little woman.<br> The critics thought so.<br> The audiences think so.<br> Packed houses, tickets<br> four months in advance.<br> I can't see that Lloyd's plays<br> have hurt you any.<br> -Easy now.<br> -Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.<br> You get me so mad sometimes.<br> Of all the women<br> with nothing to complain about...<br> -Ain't it the truth?<br> -Yes, it is.<br> You're talented, famous, wealthy.<br> People waiting around night after night<br> just to see you. Even in the rain.<br> Autograph fiends. They're not people.<br> Little beasts that run around in packs<br> like coyotes.<br> -They're your fans.<br> -They're nobody's fans.<br> They're juvenile delinquents.<br> They're nobody's audience.<br> They never see a play or a movie.<br> They're never indoors long enough.<br> Well, there's one indoors right now.<br> -I've brought her back to see you.<br> -You've what?<br> She's just outside the door.<br> The heave-ho.<br> But you can't put her out. I promised.<br> Margo, you've got to see her.<br> She worships you.<br> It's like something out of a book.<br> That book is out of print.<br> Those days are gone.<br> But if you'd only see her.<br> You're her whole life.<br> You must have spotted her by now.<br> She's always there.<br> Oh, the mousy one with<br> the trench coat and the funny hat.<br> How could I miss her?<br> Every night, every matinee.<br> Come in, Eve.<br> -I thought you'd forgotten about me.<br> -Not at all.<br> Margo, this is Eve Harrington.<br> -How do you do, my dear?<br> -Oh, brother.<br> -Hello, Miss Channing.<br> -My husband.<br> -Hello, Miss Harrington.<br> -How do you do?<br> And this is my dear friend<br> and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.<br> -Oh, brother.<br> -Miss Coonan.<br> -Oh, brother, what?<br> -When she gets like this,<br> she starts playing Hamlet's mother.<br> I'm sure you must have things<br> to do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.<br> If I haven't, I'll find<br> something till you get normal.<br> Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?<br> Harrington.<br> -I'm so sorry. Won't you sit down?<br> -Thank you.<br> Would you like a drink?<br> I was saying how often<br> you've seen the play.<br> No, thank you.<br> Yes, I've seen every performance.<br> Every performance?<br> Then am I safe in assuming you like it?<br> -I'd like anything Miss Channing played in.<br> -Would you really? How sweet.<br> I doubt very much that<br> you'd like her in The Hairy Ape.<br> Please don't misunderstand me,<br> Mr. Richards.<br> I think part of Miss Channing's greatness<br> lies in her ability to pick the best plays.<br> Your new play<br> is for Miss Channing, isn't it?<br> Of course it is.<br> -How did you hear about it?<br> -There was an item in The Times.<br> I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.<br> Yes, but let's get back to this one.<br> -Have you really seen every performance?<br> -Yes.<br> Why? I'm curious.<br> Well, if I didn't come to see the play,<br> I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.<br> There are other plays.<br> Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards.<br> But you must have friends,<br> a home, family?<br> Tell us about it, Eve.<br> -If I only knew how.<br> -Try.<br> -Well...<br> -(door opens)<br> Well, it started<br> with the play before this one.<br> -Remembrance.<br> -Remembrance.<br> -Did you see it here in New York?<br> -San Francisco.<br> It was the last week. I went one night.<br> The most important night<br> of my life, until now.<br> I found myself going the next night<br> and the next and the next.<br> Every performance.<br> Then, when the show went East,<br> I went East.<br> -Eve, why don't you start at the beginning?<br> -Oh, it couldn't possibly interest you.<br> Please.<br> I guess it started back home.<br> Wisconsin, that is.<br> It was just Mom and Dad and me.<br> I was an only child.<br> I used to make believe a lot<br> when I was a kid.<br> Acted out all sorts of things.<br> What they were isn't important.<br> But, somehow, acting and make-believe<br> began to fill up my life more and more.<br> It got so I couldn't tell<br> the real from the unreal.<br> Except that the unreal<br> seemed more real to me...<br> -I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?<br> -Not at all.<br> Farmers were poor in those days.<br> That's what Dad was, a farmer.<br> I had to help out.<br> So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,<br> became a secretary in a brewery.<br> When you're a secretary in a brewery, it's<br> hard to make believe you're anything else.<br> Everything is beer.<br> It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.<br> And there was a little theatre group there,<br> like a drop of rain on the desert.<br> That's where I met Eddie.<br> He was a radio technician.<br> We played Liliom for three performances.<br> I was awful.<br> Then the war came and we got married.<br> Eddie was in the air force.<br> They sent him to the South Pacific.<br> You were with the OWI,<br> weren't you, Mr. Richards?<br> That's what Who's Who says.<br> Well, with Eddie gone,<br> my life went back to beer.<br> Except for a letter a week.<br> One week he wrote me<br> he had leave coming up.<br> I'd saved my money and vacation time<br> and went to San Francisco to meet him.<br> But Eddie wasn't there.<br> They forwarded the telegram<br> from Milwaukee.<br> The one that came from Washington.<br> To say that Eddie wasn't coming at all.<br> That Eddie was dead.<br> I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.<br> I was alone.<br> I couldn't go back without Eddie.<br> I found a job, and his insurance helped.<br> And there were theatres in San Francisco.<br> And then, one night, Margo Channing<br> came to play in Remembrance,<br> and I went to see it.<br> Well...<br> Here I am.<br> What a story. Everything but<br> the bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.<br> There are some human experiences that<br> do not take place in a vaudeville house!<br> And that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian<br> should understand and respect.<br> -I want to apologize for Birdie.<br> -You don't have to apologize for me.<br> I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.<br> It's just my way of talking.<br> You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.<br> Call me Birdie.<br> And as for being fifth-rate,<br> I closed the first half<br> for eleven years, and you know it.<br> and how do I find you?<br> -Not ready, looking like a junkyard.<br> -Thank you so much.<br> Is it sabotage?<br> Have you no human consideration?<br> -Show me a human and I might have.<br> -Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.<br> I start shooting a week from Monday.<br> Zanuck is impatient.<br> Zanuck, Zanuck!<br> What are you two? Lovers?<br> -Only in some ways. You're prettier.<br> -I'm a junkyard.<br> -Bill. This is Eve Harrington.<br> -Hi.<br> My wonderful junkyard. The mystery<br> and dreams you find in a junkyard.<br> Heaven help me.<br> I love a psychotic.<br> -Hello. What's your name?<br> -Eve Harrington.<br> -You've already met.<br> -Huh? Where?<br> -Right here, just a minute ago.<br> -That's nice.<br> -You're not going, are you?<br> -I think I'd better.<br> It's been... I can hardly find<br> the words to say how it's been.<br> No, don't go.<br> The four of you must have so much to say<br> to each other with Mr. Sampson leaving.<br> No, stick around, please.<br> Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavsky<br> on his plane, then go somewhere and talk.<br> Well, if I'm not in the way...<br> I won't be a minute.<br> Lloyd, we've got to go.<br> Good night, Margo.<br> -I'll call you tomorrow.<br> -Not too early.<br> -Good luck, genius.<br> -Geniuses don't need good luck. I do.<br> -I'm not worried about you.<br> -Keep the thought.<br> Good night, Eve.<br> I hope I see you again soon.<br> -I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee.<br> -Not just that way. As a friend.<br> I'd like that.<br> -It's been a real pleasure, Eve.<br> -I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Mrs. Richards?<br> I'll never forget this night as long as I live.<br> And I'll never forget you<br> for making it possible.<br> (Karen) And I'll never forget you, Eve.<br> Where were we going that night,<br> Lloyd and I?<br> Funny, the things you remember<br> and the things you don't.<br> -So you're going to Hollywood?<br> -Mm-hm.<br> -Why?<br> -I just wondered.<br> -Just wondered what?<br> -Why?<br> -Why what?<br> -Why you have to go out there.<br> -I don't have to. I want to.<br> -Is it the money?<br> Then why? Why, if you're the most<br> successful young director in the theatre...<br> The theatre. The theatre.<br> What rules say the theatre exists<br> only within some ugly buildings<br> crowded into one<br> square mile of New York City?<br> Or London, Paris or Vienna?<br> Listen, Junior, and learn.<br> Do you wanna know what the theatre is?<br> A flea circus. Also opera.<br> Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,<br> Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,<br> a one-man band, all theatre.<br> Wherever there's magic and make-believe<br> and an audience, there's theatre.<br> Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.<br> Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.<br> Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.<br> Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse,<br> all theatre.<br> You don't understand them all.<br> You don't like them all.<br> Why should you?<br> The theatre's for everybody, you included,<br> but not exclusively.<br> So, don't approve or disapprove.<br> It may not be your theatre,<br> but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.<br> I just asked a simple question.<br> And I shot my mouth off.<br> Nothing personal, Junior. No offense.<br> It's just that there's so much bushwa in<br> this ivory greenroom they call the theatre,<br> sometimes it gets up around my chin.<br> But Hollywood.<br> You mustn't stay out there.<br> -It's only a one-picture deal.<br> -So few come back.<br> I read George Jean Nathan every week.<br> -Also Addison DeWitt.<br> -Every day.<br> -You didn't have to tell me.<br> -(door opens)<br> It's the latest thing, one earring.<br> If it isn't, it's going to be.<br> I can't find the other one.<br> Throw that dreary letter away.<br> It bores me.<br> -Where do you suppose it could be?<br> -It'll show up.<br> Oh, I give up. Look in the wigs.<br> Maybe it got caught in one.<br> Real diamonds in a wig.<br> The world we live in.<br> -Where's my coat?<br> -Right where you left it.<br> The seams.<br> He can't take his eyes off my legs.<br> Like a nylon lemon peel.<br> Byron couldn't have said it<br> more graciously.<br> Here we go.<br> Got any messages?<br> What do you want me<br> to tell Tyrone Power?<br> Just give him my phone number.<br> I'll tell him myself.<br> Kill the people.<br> -You got your key?<br> -See you at home.<br> I have a suggestion.<br> There's really not very much time left.<br> I mean, you haven't had a minute<br> alone yet.<br> And I could take care of everything here<br> and meet you at the gate with the ticket,<br> if you'd like.<br> I think we'd like very much.<br> -Sure you won't mind?<br> -Of course not.<br> -She's quite a girl, this whatshername.<br> -Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way.<br> That lack of pretense, that strange<br> directness and understanding.<br> Did she tell you about<br> the theatre and what it meant?<br> No, I told her. I sounded off.<br> All the religions in the world<br> rolled into one,<br> and we're gods and goddesses.<br> Isnt it silly? Suddenly I've developed<br> a big, protective feeling toward her.<br> A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle.<br> -Take care of yourself out there.<br> -They have the Indians pretty well in hand.<br> Bill.<br> -Don't get stuck on some glamour puss.<br> -I'll try.<br> You're not much of a bargain. You're<br> conceited, thoughtless and messy.<br> -Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.<br> -You're a setup for some young babe.<br> How childish are you gonna get<br> before you stop it?<br> I don't wanna be childish.<br> I'd settle for a few years.<br> And cut that out right now.<br> Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?<br> As of this moment, you're six years old.<br> All ready.<br> Thanks for your help. Good luck.<br> Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.<br> -Knit me a muffler?<br> -Call me when you get in.<br> (Bill) Hey, Junior!<br> Keep your eye on her.<br> Don't let her get lonely.<br> She's a loose lamb in a jungle.<br> Don't worry.<br> (Margo) That same night, we sent for Eve's<br> things, her few pitiful possessions.<br> She moved into the little guest room<br> on the top floor.<br> The next three weeks<br> were out of a fairy tale,<br> and I was Cinderella in the last act.<br> Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,<br> friend, psychiatrist and cop.<br> The honeymoon was on.<br> (inaudible)<br> (applause)<br> (cheering)<br> One more?<br> From now on it isn't applause,<br> just something to do<br> till the aisles get cleared.<br> What, again?<br> I could watch you play that last scene<br> a thousand times, cry every time.<br> Performance number 1,000 of this one,<br> if I play it that long,<br> will take place<br> in a well-padded booby hatch.<br> I must say, you can certainly tell<br> Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.<br> You certainly can.<br> Especially if you're me<br> between now and tomorrow morning.<br> You bought the new girdles a size smaller.<br> I can feel it.<br> Something maybe grew a size larger.<br> You can get into one of those girdles<br> and act for two and a half hours.<br> I couldn't get into the girdle<br> in two and a half hours.<br> You haven't noticed my latest bit<br> of interior decorating.<br> (Margo) But you've done so much.<br> What's new?<br> The curtains. I made them myself.<br> They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?<br> Adorable.<br> We now got everything a dressing room<br> needs except a basketball hoop.<br> Just because<br> you can't even work a zipper!<br> It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.<br> I appreciate it.<br> I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress.<br> Don't bother.<br> Mrs. Brown will be along soon.<br> No trouble at all.<br> May I be so bold as to say something?<br> -Have you ever heard of the word "union"?<br> -Behind in your dues? How much?<br> -I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.<br> -Well?<br> But the wardrobe women have got one<br> and, next to a tenor,<br> a wardrobe woman is the<br> touchiest thing in show business.<br> Oh, oh.<br> She's got two things to do:<br> carry clothes and press 'em wrong.<br> And don't let anybody try to muscle in.<br> Eve.<br> We'd better let Mrs. Brown<br> pick up the wardrobe.<br> (phone rings)<br> Hello.<br> We are ready<br> with your call to Beverly Hills.<br> -Call? What call?<br> -Is this Templeton 89970? Miss Channing?<br> Yes, it is, but I don't understand.<br> We are ready with the call you placed<br> for 12 midnight, California time,<br> to Mr. Sampson.<br> -I placed?<br> -Go ahead, please.<br> (Bill) Margo, what a wonderful surprise.<br> What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do.<br> Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill?<br> -You're my girl, aren't you?<br> -That I am.<br> Then you're crazy.<br> -When are you coming back?<br> -I leave in a week.<br> The picture's wrapped up.<br> We previewed last night.<br> Oh, those previews.<br> Like opening out of town, but terrifying.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> You're trapped. You're in a tin can.<br> In a tin can, cellophane or wrapped<br> in a Navajo blanket, I want you home.<br> -You in a hurry?<br> -In a big hurry, so be quick about it.<br> Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> You haven't even said it yet.<br> Oh, now, Bill. You know how much I do,<br> but over a phone...<br> Now, really. That's kids' stuff.<br> Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happen<br> every day and I wanna hear it.<br> -And if you won't say it, you can sing it.<br> -Sing it?<br> Sure, like the Western Union boys<br> used to do.<br> Bill...<br> It's your birthday.<br> And who remembered it?<br> Who was there on the dot at 12 midnight?<br> Happy birthday, darling.<br> The reading could've been better,<br> but you said it.<br> Now, "Many happy returns of the day."<br> Many happy returns of the day.<br> -I get a party, don't I?<br> -Of course. Birthday and coming home.<br> -Who will I ask?<br> -I know all about the party. Eve wrote me.<br> -She did?<br> -She hasn't missed a week since I left.<br> But you know that.<br> You probably tell her what to write.<br> I sent her a list of guests,<br> so check with her.<br> Yeah, I will.<br> -How is Eve? OK?<br> -OK.<br> -I love you.<br> -I'll check with Eve.<br> Hm?<br> I love you, too. Good night, darling.<br> See ya.<br> -Birdie.<br> -Hm?<br> You don't like Eve, do you?<br> You want an argument or an answer?<br> -An answer.<br> -No.<br> -Why not?<br> -Now you want an argument.<br> -She works hard.<br> -Night and day.<br> -She's loyal and efficient.<br> -Like an agent with only one client.<br> She thinks only of me,<br> doesn't she?<br> Well, let's say she thinks<br> only about ya, anyway.<br> -How do you mean that?<br> -I'll tell ya how.<br> Like...<br> Like she's studying you.<br> Like you was a play, or a book,<br> or a set of blueprints.<br> How you walk, talk, eat, think...<br> I'm sure that's flattering.<br> There's nothing wrong with it.<br> (knock on door)<br> Good morning. Well, what do<br> you think of my elegant new suit?<br> It looks much better on you<br> than it did on me.<br> I can imagine. All it needed was<br> a little taking in here and letting out there.<br> Are you sure you won't want it yourself?<br> Quite sure.<br> I find it too seventeenish for me.<br> Come now,<br> as though you were an old lady.<br> I'm on my way. Is there anything else?<br> -That script to take to the Guild.<br> -I've got it.<br> And those checks<br> for the income-tax man.<br> Right here.<br> It seems I can't think of a thing<br> you haven't thought of.<br> That's my job. See you at teatime.<br> Eve?<br> Did you place a call from me to Bill<br> for midnight California time?<br> -Golly, I forgot to tell you!<br> -Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.<br> I was sure you'd want to,<br> being his birthday.<br> You've been so busy lately. Last night<br> I meant to tell you before you went out.<br> I guess I was asleep when you got home.<br> Yes, I guess you were.<br> It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.<br> Mr. Sampson's birthday,<br> I couldn't forget that.<br> You'd never forgive me.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I sent him a telegram myself.<br> (Margo) Bill's welcome-home birthday<br> party, a night to go down in history.<br> Even before the party started,<br> I could smell disaster in the air.<br> I knew it. I sensed it even as I finished<br> dressing for that blasted party.<br> -You all put together?<br> -My back's open.<br> -Extra help get here?<br> -There's some characters<br> dressed as maids and butlers.<br> Did you call the William Morris Agency?<br> You're not funny. Actors would cost less.<br> How about the food?<br> The caterer had to go back<br> for the hors d'oeuvres.<br> Voil!<br> That French ventriloquist taught you a lot.<br> There was nothing he didn't know.<br> There's a message from the bartender.<br> "Does Miss Channing know that<br> she ordered domestic gin by mistake?"<br> The only thing I ordered<br> by mistake is the guests.<br> They don't care what they drink<br> as long as it burns.<br> -Where's Bill? He's late.<br> -Late for what?<br> Don't be dense. The party.<br> I ain't dense.<br> He's been here for 20 minutes.<br> Well, I certainly think it's odd<br> he hasn't even come up to...<br> -(laughter)<br> -The cameraman said,<br> "Even DeMille couldn't see anything<br> looking through the wrong end!" So...<br> Don't let me kill the point.<br> Or isn't it a story for grown-ups?<br> You've heard it. I looked through<br> the wrong end of the camera.<br> Remind me to tell you about the time<br> I looked into the heart of an artichoke.<br> -I'd like to hear it.<br> -Some snowy night in front of the fire.<br> Meanwhile, would you check<br> about the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?<br> The caterer forgot them.<br> The varnish wasn't dry or something.<br> Of course.<br> Looks like I'm going to have a fancy party.<br> -I thought you were going to be late.<br> -Well, I'm guest of honor.<br> I had no idea you were even here.<br> I ran into Eve<br> and she told me you were dressing.<br> That's never stopped you before.<br> She wanted to know about Hollywood.<br> She seemed so interested...<br> -She's a girl of so many interests.<br> -It's a pretty rare quality these days.<br> -A girl of so many rare qualities.<br> -So she seems.<br> So you've pointed out so often.<br> So many qualities so often.<br> Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth<br> and affection, and so young.<br> So young and so fair.<br> I can't believe you're making this up.<br> It sounds like something<br> out of an old Clyde Fitch play.<br> Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,<br> was well before my time.<br> I always deny that<br> you were in Our American Cousin<br> the night Lincoln was shot.<br> -I don't think that's funny.<br> -Of course it is.<br> This is all too laughable<br> to be anything else.<br> You know what I feel<br> about your age obsession.<br> And this getting into a jealous froth<br> because I spent ten minutes<br> with a stage-struck kid.<br> -20!<br> -30 minutes, 40 minutes. What of it?<br> Stage-struck.<br> She's a young lady of qualities.<br> And I'm fed up with both<br> the young lady and her qualities.<br> Studying me as if I were a play<br> or a blueprint.<br> How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.<br> How can you take offense at a kid<br> trying to be like her ideal?<br> Stop calling her a kid.<br> As it happens, there are<br> particular aspects of my life<br> to which I would like to maintain<br> sole and exclusive rights and privileges.<br> -For instance, what?<br> -For instance, you.<br> This is my cue to take you<br> in my arms and reassure you.<br> But I'm not going to. I'm too mad.<br> -Guilty!<br> -Mad!<br> There are certain characteristics<br> for which you are famous,<br> on stage and off.<br> I love you for some and in spite of others.<br> I haven't let those become too important.<br> They're part of your equipment for getting<br> along in what is called "our environment".<br> You have to keep your teeth sharp,<br> all right.<br> But I will not have you<br> sharpen them on me, or on Eve.<br> -What about her teeth? Her fangs?<br> -She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!<br> So when you start judging<br> an idealistic, dreamy-eyed kid<br> by the bar-room, Benzedrine standards<br> of this megalomaniac society,<br> I won't have it!<br> Eve Harrington has never by word,<br> look, thought or suggestion<br> indicated anything to me but adoration<br> for you and happiness at our being in love.<br> To intimate anything else<br> spells a paranoiac insecurity<br> that you should be ashamed of.<br> Cut. Print it.<br> What happens in the next reel?<br> Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?<br> (Eve) Miss Channing?<br> The hors d'oeuvres are here.<br> Is there anything else I can do?<br> Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.<br> I'll get it.<br> -What'll you have?<br> -A milk shake?<br> A martini, very dry, please.<br> (laughter and chatter)<br> -The party's on the first floor.<br> -Hi, Bill.<br> -Hello, Mrs. Richards.<br> -How are you, dear?<br> Good evening, Mr. Richards. Mr. Fabian.<br> -May I have your coat?<br> -I'll take it up.<br> -Please.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hi, Margo.<br> -The house looks lovely.<br> -I like that girl.<br> That quality of quiet graciousness.<br> Among so many quiet qualities.<br> Shall we?<br> -It's made me so happy your taking Eve in.<br> -I'm so happy you're happy.<br> You haven't been running<br> a settlement house exactly.<br> The kid has earned her way.<br> You had a mixed-up inventory<br> when she took over.<br> Merchandise laying all over the shop.<br> -You mixed Margo up with a five-and-ten.<br> -Make it Bergdorf Goodman.<br> Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?<br> All done up in little ribbons.<br> I could die right now<br> and nobody'd be confused.<br> -How about you, Max?<br> -How about me what?<br> Suppose you dropped dead.<br> What about your inventory?<br> I ain't going to drop dead.<br> Not with the heat.<br> This is the most ghoulish conversation.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Nothing.<br> Max! Mon vieux!<br> Fife!<br> "The kid" will be down in a minute, unless<br> you'd like to take her drink up to her.<br> I can get a fresh one...<br> Karen, you're a Gibson girl.<br> The general atmosphere<br> is very Macbethish.<br> -What has or is about to happen?<br> -What is he talking about?<br> -Macbeth.<br> -We've seen you like this before.<br> Is it over or is it just beginning?<br> Fasten your seat belts.<br> It's going to be a bumpy night.<br> -Margo, darling!<br> -How are you?<br> Mademoiselle, je vous remercie<br> pour l'invitation.<br> Enchante to you too.<br> I remember, Addison, crossing you off<br> my guest list. What are you doing here?<br> Dear Margo, you were an unforgettable<br> Peter Pan. You must play it again soon.<br> -Remember Miss Casswell?<br> -I do not. How do you do?<br> -We've never met. Maybe that's why.<br> -She is an actress.<br> A graduate of the Copacabana<br> School of Dramatic Art.<br> Ah... Eve.<br> -Good evening, Mr. DeWitt.<br> -I had no idea you knew each other.<br> This must be, at long last,<br> our formal introduction.<br> -Until now, we've only met in passing.<br> -That's how you met me. In passing.<br> Eve, this is an old friend<br> of Mr. DeWitt's mother.<br> -Miss Casswell, Miss Harrington.<br> -How do you do?<br> I've been wanting you<br> to meet Eve for the longest time.<br> Your timidity must have<br> kept you from mentioning it.<br> -You know of her interest in the theatre?<br> -We have that in common.<br> Then you two must have a long talk.<br> I'm afraid Mr. DeWitt would find me<br> boring before too long.<br> You won't bore him, honey.<br> You won't even get a chance to talk.<br> Claudia, come here.<br> You see that man?<br> That's Max Fabian, the producer.<br> Now, go and do yourself some good.<br> Why do they always look<br> like unhappy rabbits?<br> Cos that's what they are.<br> Now go and make him happier.<br> Now, don't worry about your little charge.<br> She'll be in safe hands.<br> Amen!<br> ("Liebestraum" by Liszt)<br> (changes to a jaunty tune)<br> -Liebestraum.<br> -I just played it.<br> -Play it again.<br> -But that was the fourth straight time.<br> Then this will be five.<br> Many of your guests are wondering when<br> they may be permitted to view the body.<br> -Where has it been laid out?<br> -It hasn't been laid out.<br> We haven't finished with the embalming.<br> As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.<br> The remains of Margo Channing<br> sitting up.<br> It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.<br> Wouldn't you feel more natural<br> taking a bow?<br> You know nothing about feelings,<br> natural or unnatural.<br> Your guests were also wondering<br> whether the music couldn't be<br> a shade more on the,<br> shall we say, happier side?<br> If my guests do not like it here,<br> I suggest they accompany you<br> to the nursery<br> where I'm sure<br> you will all feel more at home.<br> Margo, you by any chance haven't got<br> any bicarbonate of soda in the house?<br> Poor Max. Heartburn?<br> It's that Miss Casswell.<br> I don't see why she hasn't<br> given Addison heartburn.<br> No heart to burn.<br> Everybody has a heart,<br> except some people.<br> Of course I've got bicarb.<br> I've got a box in the pantry.<br> We'll put your name on it. "Max Fabian."<br> It will stay there always, just for you.<br> Let the rest of the world<br> beat their brains out for a buck.<br> It's friends that count.<br> -And I have friends.<br> -I love you, Max. I really mean it.<br> I love you.<br> Come to the pantry.<br> She loves me like a father.<br> Also, she's loaded.<br> There you are, Maxie dear.<br> One good burp<br> and you'll be rid of that Miss Casswell.<br> The situation I'm in ain't the kind<br> you can belch your way out of.<br> -I made a promise.<br> -To Miss Casswell? What?<br> For an audition<br> for this part we are replacing.<br> What's her name? Your sister?<br> -One?<br> -No, two, please.<br> If she can act, she might not be bad.<br> She looks like she might<br> burn down a plantation.<br> Right now, I feel like<br> there is one burning in me.<br> -When's the audition?<br> -A couple of weeks.<br> Tell you what. Why don't I read with her?<br> -Would you?<br> -Anything to help you out, Max.<br> Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.<br> Not at all. And now you<br> can do me a great favor.<br> Just name it.<br> Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.<br> -(belches)<br> -You get quick action, don't you?<br> I wouldn't think of taking<br> that girl away from you.<br> You said yourself<br> my inventory was in shape,<br> all my merchandise put away.<br> To keep her here with nothing to do,<br> I'd be standing in her way.<br> -And you need her, Max.<br> -What will she do?<br> She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,<br> interview people you have to see,<br> get rid of those you don't have to.<br> You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie.<br> -Well...<br> -Think of your health.<br> More time to relax<br> in the fresh air at a racetrack.<br> -I don't think it's such a good idea.<br> -Promise?<br> -Promise.<br> -That's my Max.<br> Oh, there you both are.<br> Max, Karen's decided it's time to go.<br> -Where is she now?<br> -Up in your room.<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> I'll go and tell Miss Casswell.<br> -Who's left out there?<br> -Too many.<br> And, besides, you got a new guest.<br> A movie star from Hollywood.<br> Shucks! And I sent<br> my autograph book to the cleaners.<br> You disapprove of me<br> when I'm like this, don't you?<br> Not exactly. Sometimes, though,<br> I wish I understood you better.<br> -When you do, let me in on it.<br> -I will.<br> -How's the new one coming?<br> -The play? Oh, all right, I guess.<br> Cora. Still a girl of 20?<br> Don't you think it's about time<br> it became important?<br> -How do you mean?<br> -Don't be evasive.<br> Margo, you haven't got any age.<br> Miss Channing is ageless.<br> Spoken like a press agent.<br> I know what I'm talking about.<br> They're my plays.<br> Spoken like an author.<br> Lloyd, I'm not 20-ish. I'm not 30-ish.<br> Three months ago I was 40 years old.<br> That slipped out.<br> I hadn't quite made up my mind<br> to admit it.<br> Now I suddenly feel as if<br> I've taken all my clothes off.<br> To thousands of people<br> you're as young as you want.<br> As young as they want, you mean.<br> I'm not interested whether thousands<br> of people think I'm six or 600.<br> Just one person, isn't that so?<br> You know what this is all about.<br> It has little to do with<br> whether you should play Cora.<br> It has everything to do with<br> you having a fight with Bill.<br> Bill's 32. He looks 32.<br> He looked it five years ago.<br> He'll look it 20 years from now.<br> I hate men.<br> Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.<br> I'll wear rompers and come in<br> rolling a hoop, if you like.<br> Who'd show up at this hour?<br> It's time people went home.<br> Hold that coat up.<br> (wolf-whistles)<br> -Whose is it?<br> -Some Hollywood movie star.<br> -Her plane got in late.<br> -Discouraging, isn't it?<br> Women with furs like that<br> where it never even gets cold.<br> Hollywood.<br> Tell me, Eve. How are things<br> going with you? Happy?<br> There should be a new word for happiness.<br> Being here with Miss Channing<br> has been a... I just can't say.<br> She's been so wonderful,<br> done so much for me.<br> Lloyd says Margo compensates for<br> underplaying on stage<br> by overplaying reality.<br> Next to that sable, my new mink<br> seems like an old bed jacket.<br> You've done your share, Eve. You've<br> worked wonders with Margo. Good night.<br> -Mrs. Richards?<br> -Karen.<br> Karen.<br> Isnt it awful? I'm about<br> to ask you for another favor,<br> after all you've done already.<br> Nobody's done so much.<br> Stop thinking of yourself<br> as one of the hundred neediest cases.<br> -What is it?<br> -Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,<br> so there isn't enough<br> to keep me as busy as I should be.<br> Not that I'd consider anything<br> that would take me away from her.<br> But the other day<br> when Mr. Fabian told Miss Channing<br> that her understudy was going to have<br> a baby and they'd have to replace her...<br> -You wanna be Margo's new understudy?<br> -I don't let myself think about it even.<br> But I do know the part so well,<br> and every bit of the staging,<br> there'd be no need to break in a new girl.<br> Suppose I had to go on one night<br> to an audience that came<br> to see Margo Channing.<br> -Oh, no, I couldn't possibly!<br> -I wouldn't worry too much about that.<br> Margo just doesn't miss performances.<br> If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays.<br> -The show must go on.<br> -No, dear. Margo must go on.<br> I don't see any reason<br> why you shouldn't be her understudy.<br> -You think Miss Channing would approve?<br> -I think she'd cheer.<br> -But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson?<br> -They'll do as they're told.<br> Then would you speak<br> to Mr. Fabian about it?<br> -Of course.<br> -You won't forget?<br> I won't forget.<br> I seem to be forever<br> thanking you for something, don't I?<br> -The bed looks like a dead animal act.<br> -(Karen chuckles)<br> -Which one is sable?<br> -But she just got here.<br> Well, she's on her way<br> with half the men in the joint.<br> -It's only a fur coat.<br> -What do you expect? Live sable?<br> Diamond collar, gold sleeves.<br> You know, picture people.<br> (Addison) Elder statesmen<br> of the theatre or cinema<br> assure the public that actors<br> and actresses are just plain folks,<br> ignoring the fact that their greatest<br> attraction to the public<br> is their complete lack of resemblance<br> to normal human beings.<br> Now there's something<br> a girl could make sacrifices for.<br> -And probably has.<br> -Sable.<br> -Sable? Did she say sable or Gable?<br> -Either one.<br> We all have abnormality in common.<br> We're a breed apart from the rest<br> of humanity, we theatre folk.<br> We are the original<br> displaced personalities.<br> You won't have to read his column<br> tomorrow, Eve. You just heard it.<br> -I don't agree, Addison.<br> -That's your particular abnormality.<br> I admit there's a screwball<br> element in the theatre.<br> It sticks out, it's got spotlights<br> on it and a brass band.<br> But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.<br> If it were, the theatre couldn't survive.<br> Oh, waiter.<br> That isn't a waiter, my dear.<br> That's a butler.<br> Well, I can't yell out "butler", can I?<br> Maybe somebody's name is Butler.<br> You have a point.<br> An idiotic one, but a point.<br> I don't wanna make trouble.<br> All I want is a drink.<br> -Leave it to me. I'll get you one.<br> -Thank you, Mr. Fabian.<br> Well done. I can see your career<br> rising in the east like the sun.<br> -You were saying?<br> -The theatre is nine-tenths hard work.<br> Work done the hard way, by sweat,<br> application and craftsmanship.<br> To be a good actor or actress,<br> or anything in the theatre,<br> means wanting to be that<br> more than anything else.<br> Yes. Yes, it does.<br> It means a concentration<br> of desire or ambition and sacrifice<br> such as no other profession demands.<br> And the man or woman who accepts<br> those terms can't be ordinary,<br> can't be just someone.<br> To give so much<br> for almost always so little.<br> "So little?"<br> "So little," did you say?<br> Why, if there's nothing else,<br> there's applause.<br> I've listened backstage to people applaud.<br> It's like...<br> Like waves of love coming over<br> the footlights and wrapping you up.<br> Imagine, to know every night<br> that different hundreds of people love you.<br> They smile, their eyes shine,<br> you've pleased them.<br> They want you. You belong.<br> Just that alone is worth anything.<br> Don't get up. And please stop acting<br> as if I were the Queen Mother.<br> -I'm sorry, I didn't...<br> -Outside of a beehive, Margo,<br> your behavior<br> is hardly queenly or motherly.<br> You're in a beehive, pal.<br> We're all busy little bees, full of stings,<br> making honey day and night.<br> -Aren't we, honey?<br> -Margo, really.<br> Please don't play governess, Karen.<br> I haven't your unyielding good taste.<br> I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,<br> but Father wouldn't hear of it.<br> He needed help behind a notions counter.<br> I'm being rude now, aren't I?<br> Or should I say, ain't I?<br> You're maudlin and full of self-pity.<br> You're magnificent.<br> How about calling it a night?<br> And you pose as a playwright.<br> A situation pregnant with possibilities,<br> and all you can think of is "go to sleep."<br> -It's a good thought.<br> -It won't play.<br> As a nonprofessional,<br> I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.<br> Undramatic, perhaps, but practical.<br> -Happy little housewife.<br> -Cut it out.<br> This is my house, not a theatre.<br> In my house you're a guest, not a director.<br> Then stop being a star and treating<br> your guests as your supporting cast.<br> -Let's not get into a big hassle.<br> -It's time we did.<br> Margo has to realize what's attractive<br> on stage need not be attractive off.<br> All right!<br> I'm going to bed.<br> You be host. It's your party.<br> Happy birthday. Welcome home.<br> And we who are about to die salute you.<br> Need any help?<br> To put me to bed?<br> Take my clothes off, hold my head?<br> Tuck me in, turn out the lights<br> and tiptoe out?<br> Eve would, wouldn't you, Eve?<br> -If you'd like.<br> -I wouldn't like.<br> -Oh, I forgot I had it.<br> -I didn't.<br> Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.<br> They're gonna play it offstage.<br> -Coming, Max?<br> -In a minute.<br> Eve, you mustn't mind Margo<br> too much, even if I do.<br> There must be some reason,<br> something I've done without knowing.<br> The reason is Margo and don't try<br> to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.<br> But if I thought I'd offended her,<br> of all people...<br> Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.<br> But I know Margo.<br> And every now and then,<br> there is nothing I wanna do so much<br> as kick her right square in the pants.<br> Well, if she has to pick on someone,<br> I'd just as soon it was me.<br> -Max is gonna drop us.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> Mrs. Richards? You won't forget, will you?<br> What we talked about before?<br> No, Eve. I won't forget.<br> Why so remote, Addison?<br> You should be at the side of<br> your protge, lending her moral support.<br> Miss Casswell is where I can<br> lend no support, moral or otherwise.<br> In the ladies' shall we say "lounge"?<br> Being violently ill to her tummy.<br> It's good luck before an audition.<br> Miss Casswell got lucky too late.<br> The audition is over.<br> It can't be. I came here to read<br> with Miss Casswell. I promised Max.<br> The audition was at 2.30.<br> It's now nearly four.<br> Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.<br> I never have, you know.<br> Who read with Miss Casswell?<br> -Bill? Lloyd?<br> -No.<br> -Well, it can't have been Max. Who?<br> -Naturally, your understudy.<br> It's unnatural to allow a girl<br> in an advanced state of pregnancy...<br> I refer to your new and unpregnant<br> understudy, Miss Eve Harrington.<br> Eve? My understudy?<br> -Didn't you know?<br> -Of course I knew.<br> It just slipped your mind?<br> How was Miss Casswell?<br> Frankly, I don't remember.<br> -Just slipped your mind?<br> -Completely.<br> Nor can anyone else present<br> tell you how Miss Casswell read,<br> or whether Miss Casswell read<br> or rode a pogo stick.<br> Was she that bad?<br> Margo, I have lived in the theatre<br> as a Trappist monk lives in his faith.<br> I have no other world, no other life.<br> Once in a great while,<br> I experience that moment of revelation<br> for which all true believers<br> wait and pray. You were one.<br> Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,<br> Hayes. There are others, three or four.<br> Eve Harrington will be among them.<br> I take it she read well.<br> It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.<br> Brilliant, vivid,<br> something made of music and fire.<br> How nice.<br> In time, she'll be what you are.<br> A mass of music and fire.<br> That's me.<br> An old kazoo with some sparklers.<br> Tell me, was Bill swept away, too?<br> Or were you<br> too full of revelation to notice?<br> Bill didn't say.<br> But Lloyd listened to his play<br> as if it had been written by someone else,<br> he said.<br> It sounded so fresh,<br> so new, so full of meaning.<br> How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.<br> How nice for everybody.<br> Eve was incredibly modest.<br> She insisted that no credit was due her.<br> That Lloyd felt as he did because she read<br> his lines exactly as he'd written them.<br> The implication being<br> that I did not read them as written?<br> Neither your name nor your performance<br> entered the conversation.<br> (door opens)<br> Ah! Feeling better, my dear?<br> Like I just swam the English Channel.<br> Now what?<br> Your next move, it seems to me,<br> should be towards television.<br> Tell me this.<br> Do they have auditions for television?<br> That's all television is, my dear.<br> Nothing but auditions.<br> Oh, Margo, darling.<br> Mm-hm!<br> Terribly sorry I was late.<br> Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab.<br> -Where's Miss Casswell? Oh, hello, Eve.<br> -Hello, Miss Channing.<br> How are you making out<br> in Mr. Fabian's office?<br> Now, Max, I don't want you<br> working this child too hard<br> just because you promised.<br> As you see, I kept my promise, too.<br> It's all over.<br> -What's all over?<br> -The audition.<br> -Eve read with Miss Casswell.<br> -Eve? How enchanting.<br> How did you get the idea of letting<br> Eve read with Miss Casswell?<br> -Well, she's your understudy.<br> -Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.<br> I thought you knew.<br> She started a week ago.<br> I've never seen her backstage,<br> but with so many people loitering about...<br> Well, well.<br> So Eve is not working for Max, after all.<br> Max, you sly puss.<br> Miss Channing, I can't tell you<br> how glad I am that you arrived so late.<br> Really, Eve? Why?<br> Otherwise,<br> I never would have dared to read.<br> -Why not?<br> -If you'd come in the middle,<br> I couldn't have gone on.<br> What a pity.<br> All that fire and music being turned off.<br> -What fire and music?<br> -You wouldn't understand.<br> How was Miss Casswell?<br> Back to the Copacabana.<br> But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.<br> I was dreadful, Miss Channing.<br> I have no right to be anyone's understudy,<br> much less yours.<br> I'm sure you underestimate yourself.<br> You always do.<br> You were about to tell me about Eve.<br> -You'd have been proud of her.<br> -I'm sure.<br> -She was a revelation.<br> -Oh, to you too?<br> -What do you mean by that?<br> -It must have been a revelation<br> to have a 24-year-old character<br> played by a 24-year-old actress.<br> -That's beside the point.<br> -It is the point.<br> It must have seemed<br> so new and fresh to you,<br> so exciting, to have your lines<br> read just as you wrote them.<br> -Addison.<br> -So full of meaning, fire and music.<br> You've talked to that<br> venomous fishwife DeWitt.<br> In this case, as trustworthy<br> as the world almanac.<br> You knew when you came in<br> that Eve was your understudy.<br> Playing that childish game<br> of cat and mouse.<br> Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.<br> Your genius for making a bar-room brawl<br> out of a perfectly innocent<br> misunderstanding.<br> Perfectly innocent?<br> Men have been hanged for less.<br> I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,<br> accused of reading your play<br> as if it were the holy gospel.<br> I never said it was.<br> You listen as if someone else had written<br> your play. Whom do you have in mind?<br> Arthur Miller? Sherwood?<br> Beaumont and Fletcher?<br> -May I say a word?<br> -No!<br> You think Miller or Sherwood would stand<br> for the nonsense I take from you?<br> Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.<br> They've been dead for 300 years!<br> All playwrights should be dead<br> for 300 years!<br> That would solve none of their problems<br> because actresses never die!<br> The stars never die and never change.<br> You may change this star<br> any time you want<br> for a new and fresh and exciting one,<br> fully equipped with fire and music.<br> Any time you want,<br> starting with tonight's performance.<br> This is for lawyers to talk about.<br> This concerns a contract<br> that you cannot rewrite or ad-lib.<br> Are you threatening me<br> with legal action, Mr. Fabian?<br> -Are you breaking the contract?<br> -Answer my question.<br> -Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.<br> -I don't hear you.<br> -I said I'm a dying man!<br> -Not until the last drugstore<br> has sold its last pill.<br> I shall never understand the process<br> by which a body with a voice<br> suddenly fancies itself as a mind.<br> Just when does an actress decide<br> they're her words she's saying<br> and her thoughts she's expressing?<br> Usually at the point<br> when she has to rewrite and rethink them<br> to keep the audience<br> from leaving the theatre.<br> It's about time the piano realized<br> it has not written the concerto!<br> And you, I take it, are the Paderewski<br> who plays his concerto on me, the piano?<br> Where is Princess Fire and Music?<br> -Who?<br> -The kid. Junior.<br> -Gone.<br> -I must have frightened her away.<br> I wouldn't be surprised.<br> Sometimes you frighten me.<br> Poor little flower.<br> Dropped her petals and folded her tent.<br> -Don't mix your metaphors.<br> -I'll mix what I like!<br> I'm nothing but a body with a voice.<br> No mind.<br> What a body. What a voice.<br> That ex ship-news reporter.<br> No body, no voice, all mind.<br> The gong rang, the fight's over,<br> calm down.<br> I will not calm down.<br> Don't calm down.<br> -You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?<br> -I'm trying terribly hard.<br> Well, you needn't be. I will not be<br> tolerated and I will not be plotted against.<br> -Here we go.<br> -Such nonsense. What do you take me for?<br> Little Nell from the country?<br> Been my understudy for a week<br> without me knowing it.<br> -Carefully hidden, no doubt.<br> -Don't get carried away.<br> Arrives here for an audition<br> when everyone knows I will be here,<br> -and gives a performance out of nowhere.<br> -You've been all through that with Lloyd.<br> The playwright doesn't make the<br> performance. It doesn't just happen.<br> Full of fire and music and whatnot.<br> Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.<br> Full of those Bill Sampson touches.<br> -I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts.<br> -Paranoiac?<br> I didn't know Eve was<br> your understudy until this afternoon.<br> Tell that to Dr. Freud<br> along with the rest of it.<br> No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.<br> Cos you've got to stop hurting the two<br> of us by these paranoiac tantrums.<br> That word.<br> I don't even know what it means.<br> It's time you found out.<br> -I love you. I love you.<br> -Hah!<br> -You're beautiful and intelligent.<br> -A body with a voice.<br> A beautiful and an intelligent woman,<br> and a great actress.<br> A great actress at the peak of her career.<br> You have every reason for happiness.<br> -Except happiness.<br> -Every reason.<br> But due to some uncontrollable drive,<br> you permit the slightest action of a kid...<br> -A kid!<br> -...a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.<br> Now, once and for all, stop it.<br> It's obvious you're not a woman.<br> -I've been aware of that for some time.<br> -Well, I am.<br> I'll say.<br> Don't be condescending.<br> Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.<br> I may have seen better days,<br> but I'm still not to be had<br> for the price of a cocktail.<br> Like a salted peanut.<br> -Margo, let's make peace.<br> -The terms are too high.<br> Just being happy? Just stopping<br> all this nonsense about Eve?<br> -And Eve and me?<br> -It's not nonsense.<br> But if I tell you it is, as I just did,<br> were you listening to me?<br> -Isnt that enough?<br> -I wish it were.<br> Then what would be enough?<br> If we got married?<br> I wouldn't want you to marry me<br> just to prove something.<br> You've had so many reasons<br> for not wanting to marry me.<br> Margo, tell me what's behind all this.<br> I don't know, Bill.<br> It's just a feeling. I don't know.<br> I think you do know.<br> But you won't or can't tell me.<br> I said before it was gonna be<br> my last try, and I meant it.<br> I can't think of anything else to do.<br> I wish I could.<br> We usually wind up screaming<br> as the curtain comes down.<br> Then it comes up again<br> and everything's fine.<br> But not this time.<br> No playwright in the world<br> could make me believe<br> this would happen<br> between two adult people.<br> Goodbye, Margo.<br> Bill?<br> Where are you going?<br> To find Eve?<br> That suddenly makes<br> the whole thing believable.<br> (sobs)<br> (door opens)<br> Lloyd.<br> -Lloyd, what's happened?<br> -Up to here, that's where I've got it.<br> Of all the star-ridden,<br> presumptuous, hysterical...<br> -Margo again.<br> -And again and again.<br> -Two hours late for the audition.<br> -That's on time for Margo.<br> And then a childish routine about<br> not knowing Eve was her understudy.<br> -It's possible she didn't.<br> -She knew.<br> Addison told her how superbly<br> Eve had read the part.<br> Karen, let me tell you about Eve.<br> She's got everything. A born actress.<br> Sensitive, understanding,<br> young, exciting...<br> You'll run out of adjectives, dear.<br> Everything a playwright first thinks<br> of wanting to write about,<br> until his play becomes<br> a vehicle for Miss Channing.<br> Margo hasn't done badly by it.<br> Margo's great.<br> She knows it, that's the trouble.<br> She can play Peck's Bad Boy<br> all she wants and who's to stop her?<br> Who's to give her that boot<br> in the rear she needs and deserves?<br> It's gonna be a cozy weekend.<br> -What is?<br> -We're driving to the country tomorrow.<br> Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.<br> Well, we've spent weekends<br> before with nobody talking.<br> Just be sure to lock up all blunt<br> instruments and throwable objects.<br> (Karen) Newton, they say,<br> thought of gravity<br> by getting hit on the head by an apple.<br> And the man<br> who invented the steam-engine,<br> he was watching a teakettle.<br> But not me. My big idea came<br> to me just sitting on a couch.<br> That boot in the rear to Margo.<br> Heaven knows, she had one coming.<br> From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,<br> Bill, Max and so on.<br> We'd all felt those size fives<br> of hers often enough.<br> But how? The answer was<br> buzzing around me like a fly.<br> I had it.<br> But I let it go.<br> Screaming and calling names is one thing,<br> but this could mean...<br> Why not? "Why," I said to myself, "not?"<br> It would all seem perfectly legitimate.<br> And only two people in the world<br> would know.<br> Also, the boot would land where it would<br> do the most good for all concerned.<br> After all,<br> it was no more than a harmless joke<br> which Margo herself<br> would be the first to enjoy.<br> And no reason why she shouldn't<br> be told about it, in time.<br> Hello. Will you please call<br> Miss Eve Harrington to the phone?<br> Not at all. I'll wait.<br> (Karen) It was a cold weekend,<br> outside and in.<br> Bill didn't come at all.<br> Margo didn't know where he was<br> and didn't care, she kept saying.<br> Somehow we staggered through Sunday,<br> and by the time we drove Margo<br> to the station late Monday afternoon,<br> she and Lloyd had thawed out<br> to the extent of being civil to each other.<br> What time is it?<br> When you asked a minute ago, it was 5.42.<br> It is now 5.43.<br> When you ask again a minute from now...<br> I just don't want Margo to miss her train.<br> As it is, she'll barely make the theatre.<br> in plenty of time.<br> That little place<br> "just two hours from New York."<br> It's on my list of things<br> I'll never understand,<br> like collecting shrunken Indian heads.<br> You should know what it means<br> to want a little peace and quiet.<br> Peace and quiet is for libraries.<br> Lloyd. Please.<br> Just a little skid, that's all.<br> This road's like glass.<br> -Karen and I just don't want an accident.<br> -I don't intend to have an accident.<br> It isn't important whether you do.<br> We are wearing long underwear.<br> Now what's this?<br> (car fails to start)<br> But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.<br> I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it full<br> when you drove to Brewster this morning?<br> I didn't look. You know<br> I don't pay attention to those things.<br> Just incredible.<br> -How much time have we got?<br> -Roughly ten minutes.<br> -How far is the station?<br> -About three or four miles.<br> -Any houses where we can borrow gas?<br> -There's not much along this back road.<br> Not many cars either.<br> Not much chance of a lift.<br> No sense in sitting here. I'm gonna<br> walk up about half a mile, just in case.<br> ("Liebestraum" by Liszt)<br> -You want it on?<br> -It doesn't matter.<br> I detest cheap sentiment.<br> (radio off)<br> -Karen?<br> -Mm-hm?<br> No, thank you.<br> -I haven't been very pleasant this weekend.<br> -We've all been a little tense lately.<br> Come to think of it,<br> I haven't been very pleasant for weeks.<br> For that, I'm truly sorry.<br> More than any two people I know, I don't<br> want you and Lloyd to be angry with me.<br> We're never deeply angry.<br> We just get mad the way you do.<br> We know you too well.<br> So many people know me.<br> I wish I did.<br> I wish someone would tell me about me.<br> You're Margo. Just Margo.<br> And what is that? Besides something<br> spelled out in light bulbs, I mean.<br> Besides a temperament, which consists<br> mostly of swooping about on a broomstick<br> and screaming at the top of my voice.<br> Infants behave the way I do, you know.<br> They carry on and misbehave.<br> They'd get drunk if they knew how,<br> when they can't have what they want.<br> When they feel unwanted or insecure or...<br> ...unloved.<br> -What about Bill?<br> -What about Bill?<br> He's in love with you.<br> More than anything in this world,<br> I love Bill. And I want Bill.<br> And I want him to want me.<br> But me, not Margo Channing.<br> And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?<br> Well, why should he and why should you?<br> Bill's in love with Margo Channing.<br> He's fought with her, worked with her,<br> loved her.<br> But ten years from now<br> Margo Channing will have ceased to exist.<br> And what's left will be... What?<br> Margo, Bill is all of<br> eight years younger than you.<br> Those years stretch as the years go on.<br> I've seen it happen too often.<br> Not to you, not to Bill.<br> Isnt that what they always say?<br> I don't suppose the heater runs<br> if the motor doesn't.<br> Silly, isn't it?<br> You'd think they'd fix it so people<br> could just sit in a car and keep warm.<br> About Eve.<br> I've acted pretty disgracefully<br> toward her too.<br> -Well...<br> -Don't fumble for excuses.<br> Not here and now with my hair down.<br> At best,<br> let's say I've been oversensitive to...<br> Well, to the fact that she's so young,<br> so feminine and so helpless.<br> To so many things I want to be for Bill.<br> It's funny, a woman's career.<br> The things you drop on your way up<br> so you can move faster.<br> You forget you'll need them again<br> when you get back to being a woman.<br> That's one career all females have<br> in common, whether we like it or not.<br> Being a woman.<br> Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.<br> No matter how many<br> other careers we've had or wanted.<br> And in the last analysis,<br> nothing's any good unless you can<br> look up just before dinner or<br> turn around in bed and there he is.<br> Without that, you're not a woman.<br> You're something with a French provincial<br> office or a... A book full of clippings.<br> But you're not a woman.<br> Slow curtain. The end.<br> Margo. Margo, I want you<br> to know how sorry I am about this.<br> -About what?<br> -This.<br> I can't tell you how sorry I am.<br> Don't give it a thought.<br> One of destiny's merry pranks.<br> After all, you didn't personally<br> drain the gasoline tank yourself.<br> (Addison) Eve, of course, was superb.<br> Many of the audience<br> understandably preferred to return<br> another time to see Margo.<br> But those who remained cheered loudly,<br> lustily and long for Eve.<br> How thoughtful of her to call<br> and invite me that afternoon.<br> And what a happy coincidence<br> that several representatives<br> of other newspapers<br> happened to be present.<br> All of us invited that afternoon<br> to attend an understudy's performance,<br> about which<br> the management knew nothing<br> until they were forced<br> to ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.<br> Coincidence.<br> (Bill) You were better than all right.<br> You rang a bell. Little things<br> here and there, but it doesn't matter.<br> Be proud of yourself.<br> You've got a right to be.<br> Are you proud of me, Bill?<br> I admit I was worried<br> when Max called. I had my doubts.<br> -You shouldn't have had any doubts.<br> -After all, the other day was one scene.<br> The woods<br> are full of one-scene sensations.<br> But you did it. With work and patience,<br> you'll be a good actress<br> -if that's what you wanna be.<br> -Is that what you want me to be?<br> -I'm talking about you and what you want.<br> -So am I.<br> -What have I got to do with it?<br> -Everything.<br> The names I've been called,<br> but never Svengali. Good luck.<br> Don't run away, Bill.<br> From what would I be running?<br> You're always after truth<br> on the stage. What about off?<br> -I'm for it.<br> -Then face it. I have.<br> Ever since that first night in here.<br> I told you<br> what every actress should know.<br> You told me that whatever I became,<br> it would be because of you.<br> -Make-up's a little heavy.<br> -And for you.<br> -You're quite a girl.<br> -You think?<br> -I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?<br> -You hear all kinds of things.<br> I'm only human, rumors to the contrary,<br> and I'm as curious as the next man.<br> -Find out.<br> -Only thing:<br> what I go after I want to go after.<br> I don't want it to come after me.<br> Don't cry. Just score it<br> as an incomplete forward pass.<br> (knocking)<br> Who is it?<br> May I come in?<br> Certainly, Mr. DeWitt.<br> I expected to find this room<br> with a theatreful of people at your feet.<br> -I'm lucky they didn't throw things.<br> -Your performance was no surprise to me.<br> After the other day, I regarded it<br> as simply a promise fulfilled.<br> You're more than kind. But it's<br> still Miss Channing's performance.<br> I'm the carbon copy you read<br> when you can't find the original.<br> -You're more than modest.<br> -It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.<br> A revolutionary approach to the theatre.<br> -But if I may make a suggestion...<br> -Please do.<br> I think the time has come<br> to shed some of your humility.<br> It is just as false not to blow your horn<br> at all as it is to blow it too loudly.<br> I don't think I've done anything<br> to sound off about.<br> We come into this world with our little<br> egos equipped with individual horns.<br> If we don't blow them, who else will?<br> Even so. One pretty good performance by<br> an understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.<br> It needn't be.<br> Even if I wanted to, as you say,<br> be less humble, blow my own horn,<br> how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.<br> -I'm somebody.<br> -You certainly are.<br> Leave the door open a bit, so we can talk.<br> After you change, if you're not busy<br> elsewhere, we could have supper.<br> I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?<br> Let's have a minimum of pretending.<br> I shall want to do a column about you.<br> I'm not even enough for a paragraph.<br> Perhaps more than one.<br> There's so much I want to know.<br> I've heard your story in part.<br> Your home in Wisconsin,<br> your tragic marriage,<br> your fanatical attachment to Margo.<br> It started in San Francisco, didn't it?<br> I say your idolatry of Margo<br> started in San Francisco, didn't it?<br> That's right.<br> San Francisco, an oasis of<br> civilization in the California desert.<br> Tell me, do you share<br> my high opinion of San Francisco?<br> Yes, I do.<br> And that memorable night when Margo<br> first dazzled you from the stage,<br> what theatre was it in San Francisco?<br> Was it the Shubert?<br> Yes, the Shubert.<br> Fine old theatre, the Shubert.<br> Full of tradition.<br> Untouched by the earthquake.<br> Or should I say fire?<br> Tell me, what was your husband's name?<br> -Eddie.<br> -Eddie what?<br> I'm about to go into the shower.<br> I won't be able to hear you.<br> Well, it can wait.<br> Where would you like to go?<br> We must make this a special night.<br> You take charge.<br> I believe I will.<br> (shower running)<br> (Karen) Some morning papers carried<br> a squib about Eve's performance.<br> Not much, but full of praise.<br> I couldn't imagine<br> how they found out about it.<br> But Lloyd said Max's publicity man<br> probably sent out the story.<br> At any rate, I felt terribly guilty<br> and ashamed of myself<br> and wanted nothing so much<br> as to forget the whole thing.<br> Margo and I were having lunch at 21,<br> just like girlfriends, with hats on.<br> -Has Miss Channing come in?<br> -Not yet.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, Eve! I've heard the most wonderful<br> things about your performance.<br> Relief that I managed<br> to stagger through it.<br> She was magnificent.<br> -Then you've heard, too.<br> -I was there.<br> -You were at the play last night?<br> -A happy coincidence.<br> -We're having lunch with a talent scout.<br> -They certainly don't waste much time.<br> -It's nothing definite. Just lunch.<br> -They'll be wasting their time.<br> Eve has no intention<br> of going to Hollywood.<br> By your smart dress,<br> I take it your companion is a lady?<br> -Margo.<br> -Margo lunching in public?<br> It's a new Margo,<br> but she's just as late as the old one.<br> She may be later than you think.<br> Why not read my column<br> to pass the time?<br> -The minutes will fly like hours.<br> -Thank you, Addison.<br> Now we must join<br> our sunburned eager beaver.<br> -Goodbye, Karen.<br> -Goodbye.<br> "And so my hat which has,<br> lo, these many seasons,<br> "become firmly rooted about my ears,<br> is lifted to Miss Harrington.<br> "I am available for dancing in the streets<br> and shouting from the housetops."<br> I thought that one went out<br> with Woollcott. Now listen to this.<br> "Miss Harrington had much to tell and<br> these columns shall report her faithfully<br> "about the lamentable practice<br> in our theatre of permitting<br> "mature actresses<br> to continue playing roles<br> "requiring a youth and vigor<br> of which they retain but a dim memory."<br> -I just can't believe it.<br> -It gets better.<br> "About the understandable reluctance<br> of our entrenched first ladies of the stage<br> "to encourage, shall we say,<br> younger actresses,<br> "and Miss Harrington's unsupported<br> struggle for opportunity."<br> -I can't believe Eve said those things.<br> -In this rat race,<br> everybody's guilty till proved innocent.<br> One of the differences between<br> the theatre and civilization.<br> What gets me<br> is how all the papers happened<br> to catch that particular performance.<br> Lloyd says it's a publicity release.<br> The witch<br> must have sent out Indian Runners,<br> snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms<br> and museums or wherever they hole up.<br> She won't get away with it.<br> Nor will Addison DeWitt<br> and his poison pen.<br> If Equity or my lawyer can't<br> or won't do anything about it,<br> I shall personally stuff that pathetic little<br> lost lamb down Mr. DeWitt's ugly throat!<br> (footsteps)<br> I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.<br> I ran all the way.<br> Bill's here, baby.<br> Everything's all right now.<br> I guess at this point<br> I'm what the French call "de trop."<br> Maybe just a little around the edges.<br> It's Addison from start to finish.<br> It drips with his brand of venom.<br> Taking advantage of a kid,<br> twisting her words,<br> making her say what he wanted her to say.<br> -Where did you get all that information?<br> -Eve.<br> -Eve?<br> -She's been to see me.<br> She left just before you came in.<br> You just missed her.<br> -That was a pity.<br> -Wanted to explain about the interview.<br> Wanted to apologize to someone,<br> and didn't dare face Margo.<br> -I wonder why.<br> -She started talking and couldn't finish.<br> She cried so.<br> I've been going over our financial position,<br> if you'll pardon the expression.<br> -That's quite a change of subject.<br> -What with taxes coming up, and,<br> since I'm a playwright and not<br> an oil-well operator, I was thinking...<br> I'm trying hard to follow you.<br> Instead of waiting until next season<br> to do Footsteps on the Ceiling,<br> which is in pretty good shape,<br> and if Margo can be talked into<br> going on tour with Aged in Wood,<br> we could put Footsteps<br> into production right away.<br> -I'm beginning to catch up.<br> -If we can cast it properly, that is.<br> Maybe get some younger actress?<br> Someone who'd look the part<br> as well as play it?<br> -You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty.<br> -Now you're quoting Addison or Eve.<br> Eve did mention the play, but in passing.<br> She'd never have the nerve<br> to ask to play a part like Cora.<br> Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.<br> I got the idea myself while<br> she was talking about the play.<br> -With gestures, of course.<br> -To write something<br> and have it realized completely.<br> For once, not to compromise.<br> Lloyd Richards, do not consider<br> giving that contemptible little worm<br> the part of Cora!<br> -Now just a minute...<br> -Margo's not been exactly a compromise.<br> Playwrights everywhere would<br> give their shirts for that compromise.<br> Now just a minute...<br> Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude<br> must be contagious.<br> All this hysteria because<br> of an impulsive excited kid<br> and a professional<br> manure-slinger named DeWitt.<br> -She apologized, didn't she?<br> -On her knees, I've no doubt.<br> Very touching.<br> Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.<br> That bitter cynicism is something<br> you've acquired since you left Radcliffe.<br> That cynicism I acquired the day I<br> discovered I was different from little boys.<br> (phone rings)<br> Hello.<br> Oh, hi, Margo.<br> No, not at all.<br> Karen and I were just chatting.<br> Hm?<br> Yes, I'm sure we can<br> and I'm sure we'd love to.<br> Right. 11.45ish.<br> See you then.<br> Margo and Bill want us to meet them<br> at the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.<br> Margo Channing in the Cub Room.<br> I couldn't be more surprised<br> if she'd said Grant's tomb.<br> -I'm glad Bill's back.<br> -They'd die without each other.<br> I didn't promise Eve anything.<br> I said she'd be fine for the part<br> but there were practical difficulties.<br> -Such as?<br> -You, for one.<br> I told her you wanted Margo to play<br> the part and I would want your approval.<br> That's fine. Fine and dandy.<br> Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington's<br> future requests to me.<br> The so-called art of acting is not one<br> for which I have a particularly high regard.<br> -Hear, hear.<br> -But you may quote me as follows.<br> "Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave<br> a performance in your cockamamie play,<br> "the like of which I have never seen before<br> and expect rarely to see again."<br> -He does not exaggerate. I was good.<br> -You were great.<br> Quite a night. I hear your understudy,<br> a Miss Harrington, has given her notice.<br> -Too bad.<br> -I'm broken up about it.<br> You just can't pick up<br> champagne and drink it.<br> Somebody's got to be<br> very witty about a toast.<br> I shall propose the toast,<br> without wit, with all my heart.<br> To Margo.<br> -To my bride-to-be.<br> -Glory hallelujah.<br> -Margo.<br> -Drink.<br> -When? When are you going to do it?<br> -Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten.<br> -And you're going to be on time.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> City Hall, that's for prizefighters<br> and reporters.<br> I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...<br> It's only for the license.<br> There's a three-day wait for blood tests.<br> I'll marry you if it turns out<br> you have no blood at all.<br> -What are you going to wear?<br> -Something simple,<br> a fur coat over a nightgown.<br> The point is this. In a cathedral,<br> a ballpark or a penny arcade,<br> we want you two beside us,<br> as our nearest and dearest friends.<br> Which we are. Which we'll always be.<br> There are very few moments in life<br> as good as this. Let's remember it.<br> To each of us and all of us,<br> never have we been more close.<br> May we never be farther apart.<br> -Mrs. Richards?<br> -Yes.<br> -For you.<br> -Thank you.<br> Very indiscreet.<br> A note in the open like that.<br> Next time, tell your lover<br> to blow smoke rings or tap a glass.<br> Lloyd, I want you to be big about this.<br> The world is full of love tonight.<br> No woman is safe.<br> Well, this beats all world's records<br> for running, jumping or standing gall.<br> "Forgive my butting in to what<br> seems such a happy occasion,<br> "but it's important that I speak with you.<br> "'Please"' and that's underlined,<br> "meet me in the ladies' room. Eve."<br> I understand she's now<br> the understudy in there.<br> Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.<br> Well, look. There's Rasputin.<br> Encore du champagne.<br> -More champagne, Miss Channing?<br> -That's what I said, bub.<br> Maybe she just wants to apologize.<br> I have no interest in anything she may say.<br> But what could she say?<br> That's what fascinates me.<br> -Go on, find out.<br> -Karen, in all the years of our friendship,<br> I have never let you go<br> to the ladies' room alone.<br> Now I must. I am busting to find out<br> what's going on in that feverish<br> little brain waiting in there.<br> Well... All right.<br> Karen!<br> How nice.<br> Very effective, but why take it out on me?<br> I was wondering<br> whether you'd come at all.<br> Don't get up. And don't act<br> as if I were the Queen Mother.<br> I don't expect you to be pleasant.<br> I don't intend to be.<br> Can't we sit down just for a minute?<br> I've got a lot to say and none of its easy.<br> -There can't be very much.<br> -But there is.<br> -Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it.<br> -Why should you?<br> Please sit down.<br> You know, I've always considered<br> myself a very clever girl.<br> Smart, good head on my shoulders,<br> that sort of thing.<br> Never the wrong word at the wrong time.<br> But then I'd never met Addison DeWitt.<br> I remember I had a tooth pulled once.<br> They gave me some anaesthetic.<br> I don't remember the name.<br> It affected me strangely.<br> I found myself saying things<br> I wasn't even thinking.<br> As if my mind was outside of my body<br> and couldn't control what I did or said.<br> -And you felt like that talking to Addison?<br> -In a way.<br> You find yourself<br> trying to say what you mean,<br> but somehow the words change.<br> They become his words.<br> And suddenly you're not saying<br> what you mean, but what he means.<br> Do you expect me to believe<br> that you didn't say any of that?<br> That they were all Addison?<br> I don't expect you to believe anything,<br> except that the responsibility<br> is mine, and the disgrace.<br> Let's not get overdramatic.<br> You really have a low opinion<br> of me, haven't you?<br> I'll give you some pleasant news.<br> I've been told off<br> in no uncertain terms, all over town.<br> Miss Channing should be happy<br> to hear that.<br> To know how loyal her friends are,<br> how much more loyal than<br> she had a right to expect me to be.<br> -Eve, don't cry.<br> -I'm not crying.<br> Tell me, how did your luncheon<br> turn out with the man from Hollywood?<br> Some vague promises of a test.<br> If a particular part should come along,<br> one of those things.<br> -But the raves about your performance...<br> -An understudy's performance.<br> Well, I think you're painting<br> the picture a little blacker than it is, really.<br> Don't underestimate him.<br> You have a powerful friend in Addison.<br> He's not my friend. You were my friends.<br> -He can help you.<br> -I wish I'd never met him.<br> I'd like him to be dead.<br> I want my friends back.<br> Eve. I don't think<br> you meant to cause unhappiness.<br> But you did. More to yourself perhaps,<br> as it turned out, than to anyone else.<br> -I'll never get over it.<br> -Oh, yes, you will.<br> You theatre people always do.<br> Nothing is forever in the theatre.<br> Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up,<br> burns hot,<br> and it's gone.<br> -I wish I could believe that.<br> -Give yourself time.<br> Don't worry too much<br> about what people think.<br> You're very young and very talented.<br> And, believe it or not,<br> if there's anything I can do...<br> There is something.<br> -I think I know.<br> -Something most important you can do.<br> You wanna play Cora. You want me<br> to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.<br> If you told him so, he'd give me<br> the part. He said he would.<br> After all you've said. Don't you know<br> that part was written for Margo?<br> It might've been 15 years ago.<br> It's my part now.<br> -You talk just as Addison said you did.<br> -Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd.<br> Nothing in the world<br> will make me say that.<br> Addison wants me to play it.<br> -Over my dead body.<br> -That won't be necessary.<br> Addison knows how Margo<br> happened to miss that performance,<br> how I happened to know she'd miss it<br> in time to notify every paper in town.<br> It's quite a story.<br> Addison could make quite a thing of it.<br> Imagine how snide<br> and vicious he could get,<br> and still tell nothing but the truth.<br> I had a time persuading him.<br> You better sit down.<br> You look a bit wobbly.<br> If I play Cora, Addison will never<br> tell what happened, in or out of print.<br> A simple exchange of favors.<br> I'm so happy I can do something<br> for you at long last.<br> Your friendship with Margo,<br> your deep, close friendship.<br> What would happen to it<br> if she knew the cheap trick<br> you played on her for my benefit?<br> You and Lloyd, how long,<br> even in the theatre,<br> before people forgot what happened<br> and trusted you again?<br> No.<br> It would be so much easier for everyone<br> concerned if I were to play Cora.<br> So much better theatre, too.<br> A part in a play.<br> You'd do all that just for a part in a play?<br> I'd do much more for a part that good.<br> Hungry?<br> I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.<br> Nothing of the kind.<br> Karen and I had a nice talk.<br> Heart to heart? Woman to woman?<br> Including a casual reference to the part<br> of Cora and your hopes of playing it?<br> I discussed it very openly.<br> I told her I'd spoken to Lloyd,<br> and that he was interested.<br> And Karen mentioned, of course,<br> that Margo expects to play the part?<br> Oddly enough, she didn't<br> say a word about Margo.<br> Just that she'll be happy to do<br> what she can to see that I play it.<br> Just like that, eh?<br> Just like that.<br> You know, Eve, sometimes<br> I think you keep things from me.<br> -I don't think that's funny.<br> -It wasn't meant to be.<br> I confide in you and rely on you<br> more than anyone I've ever known.<br> To say a thing like that now,<br> without any reason,<br> when I need you more than ever.<br> I hope you mean what you say.<br> I intend to hold you to it.<br> We have a great deal<br> in common, it seems to me.<br> -Well, what happened?<br> -Nothing much. She apologized.<br> -With tears?<br> -With tears.<br> But not right away. First fight them back,<br> chin up, stout fellow.<br> -Check.<br> -Very classy. Lots of technique.<br> You mean all this time she's done<br> nothing but apologize? What did you say?<br> Not much.<br> Groom, may I have a wedding present?<br> -What would you like? Texas?<br> -I want everybody to shut up about Eve.<br> Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.<br> Give Karen more wine.<br> Never have I been so happy.<br> Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.<br> What a lovely, clever name.<br> Where the elite meet.<br> Never have I seen so much elite,<br> all with their eyes on me,<br> waiting for me to crack that little<br> gnome on the noggin with a bottle.<br> But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.<br> Even Eve. I forgive Eve.<br> There they go.<br> There goes Eve.<br> Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.<br> But "the evil that men do..."<br> How does that go, groom?<br> Something about the good<br> they leave behind.<br> I played it once in rep in Wilkes-Barre.<br> You've got it backwards,<br> even for Wilkes-Barre.<br> Do you know why I forgive Eve?<br> She left good behind.<br> The four of us here together,<br> it's Eve fault. I forgive her.<br> And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.<br> You know, she probably<br> means well after all.<br> -She is a louse.<br> -Never try to outguess Margo.<br> -Groom?<br> -Yes, dear.<br> -Do you know what I'm going to be?<br> -A cowboy?<br> -A married lady.<br> -With a paper to prove it.<br> I'm going to look up at six o'clock,<br> and there he'll be.<br> -Remember, Karen?<br> -I remember.<br> -You'll be there, won't you?<br> -Often enough to keep the franchise.<br> No more make-believe, offstage or on.<br> Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.<br> Lloyd, will you promise<br> not to be angry with me?<br> -That depends.<br> -No, I mean deeply angry.<br> I don't think I could be.<br> Well, I don't want to play Cora.<br> -What?<br> -You're always so touchy about his plays.<br> It isn't the part. It's a great part<br> and a fine play. But not for me anymore.<br> Not for a foursquare, upright,<br> downright, forthright, married lady.<br> What's your being married<br> got to do with it?<br> It means I've finally got a life to live.<br> I don't have to play parts I'm too old for<br> just because I've got<br> nothing to do with my nights.<br> Oh, Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.<br> I'll tour a year with this one, anything.<br> Only you do understand, don't you?<br> -What's so funny?<br> -Nothing.<br> -Nothing?<br> -Everything. Everything's so funny.<br> (Karen) Lloyd never got around to asking<br> whether it was all right with me<br> for Eve to play Cora.<br> Bill, oddly enough, refused to direct<br> the play at first, with Eve in it.<br> Lloyd and Max finally won him over.<br> Margo never came to rehearsal.<br> "Too much to do around the house,"<br> she said.<br> I'd never known Bill and Lloyd<br> to fight as bitterly and often,<br> and always over some business for Eve,<br> or a move, or the way she read a speech.<br> But I'd never known Lloyd<br> to meddle as much with Bill's directing,<br> as far as it affected Eve, that is.<br> Somehow Eve kept them going.<br> Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.<br> And I thought it might be best<br> if I skipped rehearsals from then on.<br> It seemed to me I had known always<br> that it would happen. And here it was.<br> I felt helpless. That helplessness you<br> feel when you have no talent to offer,<br> outside of loving your husband.<br> How could I compete?<br> Everything Lloyd loved about me,<br> he'd gotten used to long ago.<br> (phone rings)<br> Hello?<br> Who? Who's calling Mr. Richards?<br> My name wouldn't mean anything.<br> I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.<br> She isn't well. She's been crying<br> all night and she's hysterical.<br> She doesn't want a doctor and...<br> Who is it? What's it all about?<br> -Did Miss Harrington tell you to call?<br> -Oh, no. Eve didn't say to call him.<br> I saw Mr. Richards with her<br> a couple of times.<br> I thought, they being such good friends...<br> This is Lloyd Richards.<br> Where is Eve? Let me talk to her.<br> Hello, Mr. Richards.<br> She's upstairs in her room.<br> I really hate to bother you this way,<br> but the way Eve's been feeling,<br> I've been worried sick, what with<br> her leaving tomorrow for New Haven.<br> Tell her not to worry.<br> Tell her I'll be right over.<br> (Addison) To the theatre world,<br> New Haven, Connecticut,<br> is a short stretch of sidewalk between<br> the Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,<br> surrounded by what looks<br> very much like a small city.<br> It is here that managers have<br> what are called out-of-town openings,<br> which are openings for New Yorkers<br> who want to go out of town.<br> What a day. What a heavenly day.<br> -D-day.<br> -Just like it.<br> Tomorrow morning,<br> you will have won your beachhead<br> on the shores of immortality.<br> Stop rehearsing your column.<br> Isnt it strange, Addison?<br> I thought I'd be panic-stricken,<br> want to run away or something.<br> Instead, I can't wait for tonight<br> to come. To come and go.<br> Are you that sure of tomorrow?<br> -Aren't you?<br> -Frankly, yes.<br> It'll be a night to remember.<br> It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.<br> The end of an old road,<br> the beginning of a new one.<br> -All paved with diamonds and gold?<br> -You know me better than that.<br> Paved with what, then?<br> Stars.<br> What time?<br> Almost four.<br> Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.<br> We rehearsed most of last night.<br> You could sleep now, couldn't you?<br> -Why not?<br> -The mark of a true killer.<br> Sleep tight, rest easy<br> and come out fighting.<br> Why did you call me a killer?<br> Did I say killer? I meant champion.<br> I get my boxing terms mixed.<br> Addison, come in for a minute, will you?<br> I've got something to tell you.<br> Suites are for expense accounts.<br> You're being extravagant.<br> Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd<br> had a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted.<br> -Can I fix you a drink?<br> -With the reluctant compliments of Max?<br> Lloyd. I never have any.<br> He likes a few drinks after we finish,<br> so he sent it up.<br> Some plain soda. Lloyd must be<br> expecting a record run in New Haven.<br> That's for tonight. You're invited.<br> We're having everyone up<br> after the performance.<br> "We are?"<br> Lloyd and I.<br> I find it odd that Karen<br> isn't here for the opening.<br> -Addison...<br> -She was always so devoted to Lloyd.<br> One would think only death<br> could keep her...<br> Addison.<br> I said this would be a night to remember,<br> that it would bring me all I ever wanted.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Something about an old road ending<br> and a new one starting,<br> all paved with stars.<br> I didn't mean just the theatre.<br> What else?<br> Lloyd Richards.<br> He's going to leave Karen.<br> We're going to be married.<br> So that's it. Lloyd.<br> Still just the theatre, after all.<br> It's nothing of the kind.<br> Lloyd loves me. I love him.<br> I know nothing of Lloyd's loves.<br> I leave those to Louisa May Alcott.<br> But I know you.<br> I'm in love with Lloyd.<br> He is a commercially<br> successful playwright.<br> -You have no right to say that.<br> -And, artistically, very promising.<br> Eve, dear, this is Addison.<br> Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?<br> Lloyd and I.<br> There's no telling how far we can go.<br> He'll write great plays for me.<br> I'll make them great.<br> You're the only one who knows,<br> except Lloyd and me.<br> -And Karen.<br> -She doesn't know.<br> -She knows enough not to be here.<br> -But not all of it.<br> -Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married.<br> -I see.<br> And when was this unholy alliance joined?<br> We decided night before last,<br> before we came up here.<br> I trust the setting was properly romantic.<br> Lights on dimmers<br> and gypsy violins offstage.<br> The setting wasn't romantic,<br> but Lloyd was.<br> He woke me up at three o'clock<br> in the morning, banging on my door.<br> He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.<br> Couldn't go on with the play or anything<br> else until I promised to marry him.<br> We sat and talked until it was light.<br> He never went home.<br> -You sat and talked until it was light?<br> -We sat and talked, Addison.<br> I want a run-of-the-play contract.<br> There never was, and there<br> never will be, another like you.<br> Well, say something. Anything.<br> Congratulations. Skl. Good work, Eve.<br> What do you take me for?<br> I don't know<br> that I "take you" for anything.<br> Is it possible that you've confused me<br> with those backward children<br> you've played tricks on?<br> That you have the same contempt<br> for me as for them?<br> I'm sure you mean something,<br> but I don't know what.<br> Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.<br> I am Addison DeWitt.<br> I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours.<br> -I never intended you to be.<br> -Yes, you did, and you still do.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> But I want to take my nap. It's important...<br> -It's important that we talk, killer to killer.<br> -Champion to champion.<br> Not with me, you're no champion.<br> You're stepping up.<br> Please say what you have to say,<br> plainly and distinctly,<br> and then let me take my nap.<br> Very well. Although it's unnecessary,<br> because you know what I'm going to say.<br> Lloyd may leave Karen,<br> but he will not leave Karen for you.<br> -What do you mean by that?<br> -More plainly and more distinctly?<br> I have not come to New Haven<br> to see the play, discuss your dreams,<br> or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.<br> I came to tell you that you will<br> not marry Lloyd, or anyone else,<br> because I will not permit it.<br> -What have you got to do with it?<br> -Everything.<br> Because after tonight<br> you will belong to me.<br> Belong? To you?<br> I can't believe my ears.<br> A dull clich.<br> "Belong" to you?<br> That sounds medieval.<br> Something out of an old melodrama.<br> So does the history of the world<br> for the past 20 years.<br> I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.<br> I'd hoped that you would have<br> taken it for granted that you and I...<br> "Taken it for granted?"<br> "That you and I...?"<br> Now remember, as long as you live,<br> never to laugh at me.<br> At anything or anyone else,<br> but never at me.<br> -Get out.<br> -You're too short for that gesture.<br> Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.<br> Then if you won't get out,<br> I'll have you thrown out.<br> Don't pick up that phone.<br> Don't even touch it.<br> Something told you to do<br> what I said, didn't it?<br> That instinct is worth millions.<br> You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.<br> When that alarm goes off,<br> go to your battle stations.<br> To begin with, your name is not Eve<br> Harrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski.<br> What of it?<br> True, your parents were poor,<br> and still are.<br> They would like to know how you are.<br> They haven't heard from you<br> for three years.<br> What of it?<br> A matter of opinion, granted.<br> It's also true you worked in a brewery.<br> But life there was not as dull<br> as you pictured it.<br> It got less and less dull, until your boss's<br> wife had your boss followed by detectives.<br> -She never proved a thing!<br> -But the $500 you got to get out of town<br> brought you straight to New York,<br> didn't it?<br> That $500 brought you<br> straight to New York.<br> She was a liar. She was a liar!<br> Answer my question.<br> Weren't you paid to get out of town?<br> There was no Eddie, no pilot.<br> You've never been married.<br> That was not only a lie,<br> it was an insult to dead heroes<br> and the women who loved them.<br> San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.<br> You've never been to San Francisco.<br> That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,<br> not worthy of you.<br> I had to get in to meet Margo.<br> I had to say something, be somebody.<br> Make her like me!<br> She did like you.<br> She helped and trusted you.<br> -You repaid her by trying to win Bill.<br> -That's not true!<br> I was there. I saw you and heard you<br> through the dressing-room door.<br> You used my name to blackmail Karen<br> into getting you the part of Cora.<br> -You lied to me about it.<br> -No!<br> I had lunch with Karen<br> not three hours ago.<br> As always with women who try to find out<br> things, she told more than she learnt.<br> Now do you want to change your story<br> about Lloyd beating at your door<br> that night?<br> Please, please.<br> That I should want you at all suddenly<br> strikes me as the height of improbability.<br> But that in itself is probably the reason.<br> You're an improbable person, Eve,<br> and so am I. We have that in common.<br> Also a contempt for humanity,<br> an inability to love and be loved.<br> Insatiable ambition and talent.<br> We deserve each other.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> -Then say so.<br> -Yes, Addison.<br> And you realize and you agree<br> how completely you belong to me?<br> Yes, Addison.<br> Then take your nap,<br> and good luck for tonight.<br> I won't play tonight.<br> I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.<br> "Couldn't go on"?<br> You'll give the performance of your life.<br> (door closes)<br> (Addison) And she gave<br> the performance of her life.<br> And it was a night to remember,<br> that night.<br> (applause and cheering)<br> Honored members of<br> the Sarah Siddons Society,<br> distinguished guests,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> What is there for me to say?<br> Everything wise and witty<br> has long since been said<br> by minds more mature<br> and talents far greater than mine.<br> For me to thank you as equals<br> would be presumptuous.<br> I am an apprentice in the theatre,<br> and have much to learn from all of you.<br> Let me say only that I am proud and happy,<br> and that I regard this great honor<br> not so much as an award<br> for what I have achieved,<br> but as a standard to hold against<br> what I have yet to accomplish.<br> (applause)<br> And, further, that I regard it<br> as bestowed upon me only in part.<br> The larger share belongs<br> to my friends in the theatre,<br> and to the theatre itself<br> which has given me all I have.<br> In good conscience,<br> I must give credit where credit is due.<br> To Max Fabian. Dear Max.<br> Dear sentimental, generous,<br> courageous Max Fabian,<br> who took a chance on<br> an unknown, untried amateur.<br> To my first friend in the theatre,<br> whose kindness and graciousness<br> I shall never forget,<br> Karen. Mrs. Lloyd Richards.<br> It was Karen who first brought me<br> to one whom I'd always idolized,<br> one who became<br> my benefactress and champion.<br> A great actress and a great woman,<br> Margo Channing.<br> (cheering)<br> To my director,<br> who demanded always a little more<br> than my talent could provide,<br> but who taught me patiently and well,<br> Bill Sampson.<br> (applause)<br> And one without whose<br> great play and faith in me,<br> this night could never have been.<br> How can I repay Lloyd Richards?<br> (applause)<br> How can I repay the many others,<br> so many,<br> I couldn't possibly name them all,<br> whose help, guidance, and advice<br> have made this, the happiest<br> night of my life, possible.<br> Although I am going to Hollywood<br> next week to make a film,<br> do not think for a moment<br> that I am leaving you.<br> How could I?<br> My heart is here in the theatre,<br> and 3,000 miles are too far<br> to be away from one's heart.<br> I'll be back to claim it, and soon.<br> That is, if you want me back.<br> Good night to you all,<br> and to all, a good night.<br> For services rendered beyond<br> whatever it is of duty, darling.<br> Come on, I'm the host. I got to get home<br> before my guests start stealing the liquor.<br> -Congratulations, Eve.<br> -Thank you, Karen.<br> -Congratulations, Miss Harrington.<br> -Oh, thank you so much.<br> Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry<br> too much about your heart.<br> You can always put that award<br> where your heart ought to be.<br> I don't suppose there's a drink left?<br> -You can have one at Max's.<br> -I don't think I'm going.<br> -Why not?<br> -Because I don't want to.<br> -I'm so happy for you, Eve.<br> -Thank you so much.<br> Max has gone to a lot of trouble.<br> This is going to be an elaborate party<br> and it's for you.<br> No, it isn't. It's for this.<br> -It's the same thing, isn't it?<br> -Exactly.<br> Here, take it to the party instead of me.<br> You're being very childish.<br> -I'm tired. I want to go home.<br> -Very well. I'll drop you off.<br> I shall go to the party alone.<br> I have no intention of missing it.<br> -Who are you?<br> -Miss Harrington.<br> -What are you doing here?<br> -I... I guess I fell asleep.<br> Please don't have me arrested.<br> I didn't steal anything. You can search me.<br> -How did you get in here?<br> -I hid outside till the maid came in.<br> She went out to get something<br> and left the door open.<br> I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.<br> Then I just looked around.<br> I was afraid someone would notice<br> the lights were on, so I turned them off.<br> -Then I guess I fell asleep.<br> -You were just looking around?<br> -That's all.<br> -What for?<br> -You probably won't believe me.<br> -Probably not.<br> -It was for my report.<br> -What report? To whom?<br> About how you live,<br> what kind of clothes you wear,<br> what kind of perfume<br> and books, things like that.<br> You know the Eve Harrington Club that<br> they have in most girls' high schools?<br> -I've heard of them.<br> -Ours was one of the first, Erasmus Hall.<br> -I'm the president.<br> -Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?<br> Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.<br> Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.<br> Of course, they're just movie stars.<br> You're going to Hollywood, aren't you?<br> Mm-hm.<br> From the trunks you're packing,<br> you must be going to stay a long time.<br> I might.<br> That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.<br> Maid'll fix it in the morning.<br> -I'll just clean up the mess.<br> -Don't bother.<br> -How'd you get up here from Brooklyn?<br> -Subway.<br> How long does it take?<br> With changing and everything,<br> a little over an hour.<br> It's after one now.<br> You won't get home till all hours.<br> I don't care if I never get home.<br> (buzzer)<br> That's the door.<br> You rest. I'll get it.<br> Hello. Who are you?<br> Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. DeWitt.<br> She asked me to see who it is.<br> Well, we won't disturb her rest.<br> It seems Miss Harrington left her award<br> in the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?<br> Tell me, how did you know my name?<br> It's a very famous name, Mr. DeWitt.<br> -And what's your name?<br> -Phoebe.<br> -Phoebe?<br> -I call myself Phoebe.<br> And why not?<br> Tell me, Phoebe, do you want someday<br> to have an award like that of your own?<br> -More than anything else in the world.<br> -Then ask Miss Harrington how to get one.<br> Miss Harrington knows all about it.<br> (Eve) Who was it?<br> Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.<br> You left your award in his cab,<br> and he brought it back.<br> (Eve) Put it on one of the trunks,<br> will you? I wanna pack it.<br> Sure, Miss Harrington.<br>
