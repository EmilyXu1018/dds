                        "ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT"<br> This story is neither an...<br> accusation nor a confession...<br> and least of all an adventure...<br> for death is not an adventure...<br> to those who stand<br> face to face...<br> with it. It will try simply to...<br> tell of a generation<br> of men who.<br> even though they may have...<br> escaped its shells, were<br> destroyed...<br> by the war...<br> - Thirty thousand.<br> - From the Russians?<br> No, from the French.<br> From the Russians we capture<br> more than that every day.<br> Mr. Postman.<br> War is war and schnapps is schnapps,<br> and business must go on.<br> You didn't leave the mail<br> yet this morning.<br> Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.<br> Hello, Himmelstoss. Anything<br> for us today?<br> - No, no, Master Peter.<br> - Oh, there must be something.<br> Here, here you go, young lad.<br> There. This is the last mail<br> deliver anyhow.<br> - What?<br> - Tomorrow I change uniforms.<br> - You're going in the army?<br> - Yes, I was called.<br> I'm a sergeant in the<br> reserves, you know.<br> I'll be called my self, if it doesn't<br> end in a few months.<br> - It will, though.<br> - I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.<br> ...defending our country,<br> our father land.<br> Now, my beloved class, this<br> is what we must do.<br> Strike with all our power.<br> Give every ounce of strength...<br> to win victory before the<br> end of the year.<br> It is with reluctance that I bring<br> this subject up again.<br> You are the life of the<br> fatherland, you boys.<br> You are the iron men<br> of Germany.<br> You are the gay heroes who<br> will repulse the enemy...<br> when you are called upon<br> to do so.<br> It is not for me to suggest<br> that any of you...<br> should stand up and offer<br> to defend his country.<br> But I wonder if such a thing is<br> going through your heads.<br> I know that in one<br> of the schools...<br> the boys have risen up<br> in the classroom...<br> and enlisted in a mass.<br> But, of course, if such a thing<br> should happen here...<br> you would not blame me<br> for a feeling of pride.<br> Perhaps some will say...<br> that you should not be<br> allowed to go yet...<br> that you are too young, that you<br> have homes, mothers. Fathers...<br> that you should not<br> be torn away.<br> Are your fathers so forgetful<br> of their fatherland...<br> that they would let it perish<br> father than you?<br> Are your mothers so weak that<br> they cannot send a son...<br> to defend the land which<br> gave them birth?<br> And after all, is a little<br> experience...<br> such a had thing<br> for a boy?<br> Is the honour of wearing<br> a uniform...<br> something from which<br> we should run?<br> And if our young ladies glory<br> in those who wear it...<br> is that anything to be<br> ashamed of?<br> I know you have never desired<br> the adulation of heroes.<br> That has not been part<br> of my teaching.<br> We have sought to make<br> ourselves worthy...<br> and let a claim come<br> when it would.<br> But to he foremost<br> in battle...<br> is a virtue not to be<br> despised.<br> I believe it will he<br> a quick war...<br> that there will he<br> few losses.<br> But if losses there must be...<br> then let us remember<br> the Latin phrase...<br> which must have come to the<br> lips of many a Roman...<br> when he stood embattled<br> in a foreign land:<br> "Dulce et decorum est<br> pro patria mori."<br> "Sweet and fitting it is to die<br> for the fatherland."<br> Some of you may<br> have ambitions.<br> I know of one young man who has<br> great promise as a writer...<br> and he has written the first<br> act of a tragedy...<br> which would be a credit to<br> one of the masters.<br> And he is dreaming,<br> I suppose...<br> of following in the footsteps<br> of Goethe and Schiller...<br> and I hope he will.<br> But now our country calls.<br> The fatherland needs leaders.<br> Personal ambition must<br> be thrown aside...<br> in the one great sacrifice<br> for our country.<br> Here is a glorious beginning<br> to your fives.<br> The field of honour<br> calls you.<br> Why are we here?<br> You, Kropp, what has<br> kept you back?<br> You, Mueller, you know how<br> much you are needed?<br> Ah, I see you look<br> at your leader.<br> And I, too, look to you,<br> Paul Baumer...<br> and I wonder what you<br> are going to do.<br> - I'll go.<br> - I want to go.<br> Count on me.<br> - Me too.<br> - I'm ready.<br> I'm not gonna stay home!<br> Follow me!<br> Enlist now!<br> - No more classes!<br> - No more classes!<br> - Don't be a quitter!<br> - Come on, Behn!<br> Stick together. That's what<br> we've got to do.<br> - Let's all stick together.<br> - Come on, Behn.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> - I'll go.<br> - That's the way!<br> Let's go!<br> Hey! Let's sing!<br> Come on!<br> Keep in line there,<br> soldiers.<br> Anything you say,<br> General.<br> Detail, halt!<br> Left face!<br> Get into uniform, ready to<br> report. Fall out!<br> I betcha a place like this gets<br> you in good condition.<br> You have to be for the<br> long marches.<br> I'm gonna get in the<br> cavalry and ride.<br> No cavalry for me.<br> Infantry's where you<br> see the fighting.<br> Where are all the guns? That's<br> what I want to know.<br> Oh, you don't get a gun for<br> a long while yet.<br> If I'm gonna bump off the enemy,<br> I gotta have some practice.<br> Bayonet drill. That's<br> what I want.<br> You won a medal that<br> times, Mueller.<br> You wait. In about a month I'll<br> be covered with them.<br> Say, keep your boots<br> out of my face!<br> Why, it's an Honor to have those<br> boots in your face.<br> They're the best pair in the army!<br> My uncle gave them to me.<br> Just look at that special<br> imported leather.<br> Put them anyplace you like,<br> except in my face.<br> Not even a kitchen maid'll<br> look at me in this!<br> Attention!<br> Well, for the love of...<br> It's Himmelstoss!<br> - So it is.<br> - And all dressed up.<br> Hello, Himmie. You didn't think you'd<br> see me again so soon, did you?<br> - You see my rank?<br> - Sure.<br> Fall back, then!<br> Himmelstoss, we certainly<br> are glad to see you.<br> What did you say?<br> - I was going to say...<br> - Never mind!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> When you address your superior<br> officer, say "sir"!<br> - Where'd he get such a nice uniform?<br> - Any mail for us, Himmie?<br> - Quiet!<br> - My dear fellow, you're shouting.<br> Ah, come on, Himmelstoss.<br> We know ya. Take off the<br> false whiskers.<br> - I believe you mean it!<br> - You'll find out that I mean it.<br> But only three days ago you<br> were our postman.<br> Silence!<br> Come back here!<br> Line up!<br> Line up! Get in some kind<br> of a line!<br> All of you! Line up,<br> I say!<br> What a pretty sight that is!<br> Have you never heard<br> of standing in line?<br> You make a fine mess of it.<br> Well, I'll have to<br> teach you.<br> We'll append the whole<br> day on it, huh?<br> You may be stupid but<br> I'm used to that.<br> And then there'll be plenty<br> of other things too.<br> Oh, I'll not neglect you.<br> You're not much to<br> begin with...<br> but I'll do my best.<br> I see that we have come here with<br> a slight misunderstanding...<br> and we'll correct that,<br> too, won't we, huh?<br> And the first thing to do is to forget<br> everything you ever knew.<br> Everything you ever learned,<br> forget! See?<br> Forget what you've been and what<br> you think you're going to be.<br> You're going to be soldiers,<br> and that's all!<br> I'll take the mother's milk out of you!<br> I'll make you hard-boiled!<br> I'll make soldiers out of you<br> or kill you!<br> Now... salute!<br> Detachment... lie down!<br> Head down!<br> Keep your head down,<br> Baumer!<br> Detachment... get up!<br> Now sing!<br> Do you call that singing?<br> Detachment, halt!<br> So... we have no spirit, huh?<br> We are in no mood<br> for recreation.<br> Work is what we want.<br> Good!<br> Then we'll go back<br> to work!<br> Detachment... lie down!<br> Keep your head down!<br> Now sing!<br> Men... halt!<br> Order, arms!<br> Inspection at 3:00.<br> Dismissed!<br> Oh, that swine! That means<br> we get no time off.<br> It will take four hours to get<br> ready for inspection.<br> - I'd like to know what's in his mind.<br> - He hasn't got any!<br> I'm gonna cut him open sometime<br> and find out!<br> He's too thick-skinned.<br> He won't cut.<br> This is the fourth time he's made<br> me disappoint that poor girl.<br> Arms!<br> Order, arms!<br> Left shoulder, arms!<br> Squad right. To the right,<br> march!<br> Left, left, left, left.<br> Follow right,<br> march!<br> Squad, left march!<br> Forward... march!<br> Detachment...<br> halt!<br> Present arms!<br> Himmelstoss.<br> Excellent work. They're going up<br> front tomorrow.<br> - I recommend leave till midnight.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Left, left, left.<br> Detachment...<br> lie down!<br> Crawl forward!<br> He spoiled our leave. I'll never<br> forgive him for that.<br> - The rat!<br> - Leave till midnight.<br> It'll take till midnight to<br> dry our clothes.<br> There goes the filthy<br> ape now.<br> While we slave over this mud, he<br> goes off to have a few drinks!<br> Someday I'm going to take one<br> smack at him... just one.<br> Me too. That's gonna be my<br> life's work from now on.<br> Why only one? I'm gonna<br> take several.<br> I might even kick him while<br> he's down I feel mean.<br> What are you doing?<br> You're not going to desert,<br> are you?<br> What?<br> Listen. I've got an idea.<br> Crawl forward!<br> Lie down!<br> Lie down! Crawl forward!<br> Oh! What?<br> Cover!<br> Paul, you all right?<br> Behn! Behn!<br> Behn! Come on!<br> Behn, come on! You fool!<br> Behn!<br> Get up! Come on.<br> Sounds like more replacements<br> coming in.<br> Yeah. Tjaden must have gone<br> home, for that wood.<br> There's some more, fresh from<br> the turnip patch.<br> I suppose this is where<br> we bunk.<br> That's me, "I. Westhus..."<br> and this is where I live.<br> - I didn't know!<br> - Well, you know now!<br> Yes. Yes, of course.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Here's a bunk, Paul.<br> - When did we eat last?<br> - Don't remind me.<br> - I was fine until you spoke.<br> - Where are we anyway?<br> I don't know. The name on the<br> railroad station's been shot off.<br> There must be something<br> to eat somewhere.<br> I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll ask those fellas.<br> Sorry to disturb you,<br> Mr. Westhus.<br> Oh. Meet Detering. A better<br> farmer never lived.<br> - And Mr. Tjaden.<br> - Sit down.<br> You see, we haven't eaten<br> since breakfast.<br> We thought maybe you could tell us<br> what we ought to do about it.<br> Eat without further delay.<br> Well, what's funny<br> about that?<br> This is a bad town to bring an<br> appetite to, soldier.<br> We've been here since yesterday morning<br> living on baled hay and razor blades.<br> We're willing to buy our food.<br> Where's the canteen?<br> The only canteen in these regions<br> is out looking for supplies.<br> - Ever hear of Katczinsky?<br> - Who?<br> Katczinsky. He's uncanny.<br> If there's any food within 25 miles,<br> he'll be the one to get it.<br> Attention!<br> What's this?<br> Volunteers for the future<br> general's staff.<br> Sometime I'm gonna take one of<br> you volunteers apart...<br> and find out what makes you leave<br> school and join the army.<br> At ease. This is no<br> parade ground.<br> - Hungry?<br> - Yes.<br> Wait! Wait a minute!<br> That's no invitation.<br> - Can you pay?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> I have some money.<br> No, not money. That's just<br> pieces of paper.<br> Have you got any cigarettes,<br> cigars...<br> - Or soap, cognac...<br> - Yeah.<br> - Chewing tobacco?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Kat!<br> Are you crazy? There ain't<br> enough here for us.<br> I wish you three would get<br> bumped off.<br> I'm tired of feeding ya<br> for nothing.<br> Bring everything you got.<br> - I'm so hungry...<br> - I'd be glad to give you...<br> - Come on!<br> - Is this enough, sir?<br> Kat!<br> - You've got the wiring detail tonight.<br> - Where?<br> - Past the graveyard.<br> - With this bunch?<br> It's quiet tonight. You can teach them<br> a couple of things.<br> Thanks. I'd rather<br> do it alone.<br> - These babes get killed off too fast.<br> - Well, the lorry's waiting.<br> Last night I was too<br> hungry to sleep...<br> and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out<br> of my gut, they think up wiring duty.<br> Well, here's your chances,<br> heroes.<br> For the fatherland!<br> Come on, get your stuff and<br> let's get out of here.<br> - Is that any way to drive?<br> - Let him drive any way he wants.<br> Suppose he breaks your arm. You<br> get sent home, don't you?<br> A lot better than having<br> a hole in your guts.<br> If there's any of you left, I'll pick<br> you up in the morning.<br> Well, if that ride you gave us<br> didn't kill us, nothing will.<br> And be on time. I don't want to<br> miss my breakfast.<br> You better wait for your army,<br> Papa.<br> Here, here. Don't be<br> so backward.<br> Listen, children. All we got to do<br> is to string a little wire.<br> We pick it up at the dump and carry<br> it to where we need it.<br> Now, you're gonna see some shell fire,<br> and you're gonna be scared, see?<br> It's all right, boy.<br> Get up.<br> Here. Never mind.<br> It's happened to better men than you,<br> and it's happened to me.<br> When we come back, I'll get you all<br> some nice clean underwear.<br> That kind of shell you don't have<br> to pay much attention to.<br> Those big fellas just make a lot<br> of noise and land about...<br> five miles behind the line.<br> The things we've got to watch<br> out for are the light ones.<br> They don't give you<br> much warning.<br> They go "waa-aa-aah zing."<br> And when you hear that,<br> down!<br> Mother Earth.<br> Press yourselves down<br> upon her.<br> Bury yourselves deep<br> into her.<br> Just keep your eyes on me.<br> When you see me flop,<br> you flop...<br> only try to beat me to it.<br> Now listen.<br> I'll show you how<br> it's done.<br> Give me a couple of those.<br> That's to kill the noise.<br> Tjaden.<br> See that?<br> - What's that mean?<br> - Bombardment.<br> My eyes!<br> I'm blind!<br> I can't see!<br> God!<br> My eyes! I can't see!<br> - I can't see!<br> - It's Behn! It's Behn!<br> - I'll go get him...<br> - You'll get killed!<br> - Let me...<br> - Lay down and stay there!<br> He's dead.<br> - He's dead!<br> - Why did you risk your life...<br> bringing him in?<br> But it's Behn!<br> - My friend.<br> - He's a corpse, no matter who it is.<br> Now, don't any of you<br> ever do that again.<br> Put him over there.<br> - Mind the wire.<br> - Mind the wire.<br> - Mind the wire.<br> - Mind the wire.<br> - Mind the wire.<br> - Mind the wire.<br> All right, come on.<br> All right, come on. Get your packs<br> and fall in. Hurry up!<br> Come on. Hurry up.<br> Make it snappy.<br> Get your packs<br> and fall in.<br> Kat, what are we doing?<br> What's happening?<br> You heard him. Orders<br> to march.<br> - But where to, for the love of...<br> - Another party.<br> And this one is gonna<br> last a long time.<br> Come on.<br> Here we go.<br> Company, attention!<br> Shoulder arms!<br> March right,<br> march!<br> Take your hands off that!<br> - Queen takes it!<br> - Well, if you think...<br> that's a queen, look again.<br> Ah, it's a jack.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Honest, these cards all look alike.<br> It's too noisy!<br> I can't play.<br> I suppose your delicate nerves...<br> - Can't stand it.<br> - Get up!<br> That's Oscar.<br> The son of a...<br> Look at that!<br> Don't be so snooty. You may wish<br> you had this back.<br> About two more days of this...<br> and this rat-bitten and of a piece<br> of bread's gonna taste...<br> like a hunk of fruitcake.<br> It wouldn't... It wouldn't last two<br> more days, would it?<br> Didn't I tell you this was<br> gonna be a bad one?<br> I don't mind the days so much.<br> It's keeping up all night...<br> Ah, two more days makes<br> a week, kid.<br> Then you can say you've<br> been under fire!<br> You're not scared, are you?<br> No. I was just asking.<br> That's all.<br> - Wanna play some more?<br> - Do you?<br> - Sure.<br> - All right. My deal.<br> You better get your boot back<br> before Oscar eats that!<br> The kid's all right.<br> Yeah, yeah. Let him sleep.<br> He's dreaming.<br> Oh, God. Can't you see<br> it's Behn?<br> He didn't want to<br> come to war!<br> No, no.<br> It isn't Behn.<br> It isn't Behn!<br> It's Kemmerick!<br> It's me!<br> Shut up, will you? It's bad<br> enough in here as it is.<br> Every...<br> Everything's all right, Franz.<br> You're dreaming.<br> You're just dreaming,<br> I guess.<br> - Attention!<br> - At ease.<br> The barrage is getting worse.<br> The men in two more<br> dugouts gone.<br> However, we'll do our best to get<br> some food up here by evening.<br> Stop! Stop!<br> Let me out!<br> - What did you do that for?<br> - Shut up! Grab him.<br> - No.<br> - Now hold him.<br> You all right now?<br> I think so.<br> I couldn't hold out<br> much longer.<br> - Oh, god, it's Franz!<br> - Get him over there!<br> No, he's been hit in the stomach.<br> He can't have anything to drink.<br> Get a stretcher.<br> Where'd they get you,<br> Kemmerick?<br> - Here it is, sir.<br> - Take his head.<br> All right. Take him out.<br> - Is it serious, sir?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> - Tell the others he's all right.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> If we're going to fight,<br> why don't we fight?<br> Why don't we go over?<br> You could go crazy<br> staying here.<br> Let's do something!<br> - Let's go after them!<br> - Sit down!<br> If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd<br> try to bring something through.<br> He's so far behind the lines he<br> can't hear the shooting!<br> - Here's Kat. Get anything?<br> - Any luck?<br> - We'll have to split this up among us.<br> - Something to eat!<br> We need butter too.<br> Yes. And dessert. And a feather<br> bed to sleep on.<br> - Rats! Rats!<br> - Rats!<br> Get out of the way!<br> What's that?<br> Come on! Grab your rifles!<br> Come on!<br> - Here they come.<br> - Get your grenades here.<br> Hurry up. Come on, hurry up.<br> Let's go!<br> Let's go!<br> Back to your own lines!<br> - Fill it up.<br> - And hurry up.<br> I've got other things to do.<br> I've been waiting for this<br> for three weeks.<br> When they all<br> get here.<br> What do you want?<br> Beans, you homely - looking<br> son of a frog's leg.<br> - What do you think I want?<br> - We're hungry.<br> Shut up! I'll feed you when<br> you're all here.<br> - We're all here now.<br> - Only half the company's here.<br> Get the rest.<br> Wake them up.<br> I wish I could wake them up.<br> There's 80 of us left.<br> The rest is in dressing stations<br> or pushing up daisies.<br> Eighty? And I cooked for 150!<br> All right. We'll have enough for<br> once. Come on. Dish out!<br> You mean you've cooked<br> beans for 150...<br> and you've got bread<br> for 150...<br> and sausage for 150, and<br> tobacco for 150?<br> Everything! It's all wrong. I should<br> have been notified.<br> What a feast!<br> Everyone gets two issues.<br> - Get back in line! Get back in line!<br> - Oh, no!<br> That won't do.<br> I can't give 80 men what's<br> meant for 150.<br> Listen.<br> You drew rations for the 2nd<br> Company, didn't ya?<br> Yeah.<br> All right. We're the<br> I've got my orders.<br> - Kat's right.<br> - We're the 2nd Company?<br> And if only half of us get back,<br> that's our good luck.<br> - Come on. Dish it out.<br> - Come on!<br> - No!<br> - Hey!<br> You're the yellowest baboon that<br> ever drew a cook wagon...<br> and you're scared...<br> it shows.<br> All we want to hear out of you<br> is one more little yip...<br> and we'll cut ya up<br> and eat ya raw.<br> Why, you keep your kitchen<br> so far back of the lines...<br> we never get anything to eat until<br> it's cold and we're asleep!<br> Now, you low-down rat,<br> get out...<br> or we wreck the joint!<br> - Come on! Give us...<br> - Attention!<br> At ease.<br> What's going on here?<br> He's cooked for 150, sir, and he<br> only wants to give us half.<br> - Looks pretty good.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Serve the whole issue.<br> - The men can use it.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - And bring me a plate too.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All right. Take it all.<br> Take everything.<br> Give them honey. Give them<br> what they want.<br> - Fill it up!<br> - Fill it up!<br> - Don't mind me.<br> - Oh, that's all right. Don't mention it.<br> You know...<br> I could do with some<br> more beans.<br> Go help yourself. There's<br> more ever there.<br> It's too far.<br> I wonder, when are we going<br> back to the front?<br> Tomorrow.<br> It's enough to take away<br> a man's appetite.<br> You know, if they're gonna march<br> us in again tomorrow...<br> we ought to go see how<br> Kemmerick is.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> - Let's do that.<br> - How far is the dressing station?<br> - About two miles.<br> - We could take his things to him.<br> - Good!<br> It seemed rotten to think of a thing<br> like that happening to him...<br> a nice fellow like<br> Kemmerick.<br> Ah, the French certainly deserve to be<br> punished for starting this war.<br> Everybody says it's<br> somebody else.<br> Well, how do they<br> start a war?<br> Well, one country offends<br> another.<br> How could one country<br> offend another?<br> You mean there's a mountain over<br> in Germany gets mad...<br> at a field over in France?<br> Well, stupid, one people<br> offends another.<br> Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't<br> be here at all.<br> I don't feel offended.<br> It don't apply to tramps<br> like you.<br> Good. Then I can be going<br> home right away.<br> - Ah, you just try it.<br> - Yeah. You wanna get shot?<br> The Kaiser and me...<br> Me and the Kaiser felt just<br> alike about this war.<br> We didn't either of us want any<br> war, so I'm going home.<br> - He's there already.<br> - Somebody must have wanted it.<br> Maybe it was the English.<br> No, I don't want to shoot<br> any Englishmen.<br> I never saw one till<br> I came up here.<br> And I suppose most of them never saw<br> a German till they came up here.<br> No, I'm sure they weren't<br> asked about it.<br> No.<br> Well...<br> it must be doing somebody<br> some good.<br> - Not me and the Kaiser.<br> - I think maybe the Kaiser...<br> wanted a war.<br> You leave us<br> out of this.<br> I don't see that.<br> The Kaiser's got everything<br> he needs.<br> Well, he never had a<br> war before.<br> Every full-grown emperor needs one<br> war to make him famous.<br> - Why, that's history.<br> - Yeah, generals too. They need war.<br> And manufacturers.<br> They get rich.<br> I think it's more a<br> kind of fever.<br> Nobody wants it<br> in particular...<br> and then all at once,<br> there it is.<br> We didn't want it. The English<br> didn't want it.<br> And here we are fighting.<br> I'll tell you how it should<br> all be done.<br> Whenever there's a big<br> war coming on...<br> - You should rope off a big field...<br> - And sell tickets.<br> Yeah. And...<br> And on the big day...<br> you should take all the kings and<br> their cabinets and their generals...<br> put them in the center dressed<br> in their underpants...<br> and let them fight it out<br> with clubs.<br> The best country wins.<br> Well, now that Kat's settled everything,<br> let's go see Kemmerick.<br> Something interesting might<br> happen on the way.<br> Might cheer him up.<br> Boys, me and the Kaiser want you<br> back in time to march tomorrow.<br> Don't forget.<br> - We'll be back.<br> - Give the boy my regards.<br> There he is.<br> - Hello, Kemmerick.<br> - How are you?<br> How's it going?<br> How are things going? Are they<br> looking after you all right?<br> How are they treating you?<br> Franz?<br> They're robbers here.<br> Robbers.<br> They stole my watch!<br> I always told you, nobody should<br> carry as good a watch as that.<br> - They took it while I was under ether!<br> - Franz, you'll get it back.<br> Do you feel all right?<br> - Just look at my hand.<br> - That's because you lost...<br> so much blood.<br> Just eat decently and you'll<br> get well again.<br> You must eat. What's the main thing.<br> It looks good too.<br> I have such a terrible pain<br> in my foot.<br> Every toe on my right<br> foot hurts.<br> Well, how can your foot hurt<br> when your leg's been...<br> I know what you mean!<br> I know!<br> I know now!<br> They cut my leg off.<br> Why didn't they tell me? Why...<br> Why didn't they tell me?<br> - Franz! Franz!<br> - Now I can't walk anymore!<br> You must be thankful that you've<br> come off with only that.<br> I wanted to be a<br> forester once.<br> You can yet. They make artificial<br> legs that are wonderful.<br> And you're through too. You can<br> go home. Think of that.<br> We brought your things<br> for you. See?<br> Put them under the bed.<br> That's a marvellous pair<br> of boots.<br> Look at that leather!<br> What comfort.<br> I was just thinking.<br> If you're not going to be using<br> these, Franz...<br> why din't you leave<br> them with us?<br> What good are they to you?<br> I can use them.<br> My boots give me blister<br> after blister...<br> Well, we'll be going,<br> Franz.<br> Oh, don't go. Stay just<br> a little while longer.<br> - I'll come right back. We'll be<br> coming soon again, Franz.<br> - I know you'll be feeling better.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Good-bye, Franz.<br> You think he'll last till after mess?<br> - I don't think...<br> - Done for.<br> Boys, you go along.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Good-bye. All right, Paul.<br> I'm sorry, Paul.<br> I wouldn't touch a thing of<br> his if he could use it.<br> I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for<br> him if it'd do him any good.<br> Only... Only why should some<br> orderly get those boots?<br> I understand, Mueller. We're<br> all alike out here.<br> And good boots<br> are scarce.<br> Tell the doctor to come,<br> please.<br> Doctor, the man in the next bed<br> would like to see you, sir.<br> I've done everything I can for him.<br> There's no helping him.<br> Poor little fella.<br> He says next time,<br> Franz.<br> Do you think I'll ever<br> get well?<br> Why, of course.<br> - Do you really think so?<br> - Sure, once you get...<br> over the operation.<br> I don't think so.<br> Franz! Don't talk nonsense. Why,<br> you'll be as good as new.<br> They fix up worse things<br> than that.<br> Perhaps you'll go to the<br> convalescent home...<br> in Klosterberg among<br> the villagers.<br> Then you can look out of the<br> windows, across the fields...<br> to the two trees<br> on the horizon.<br> The loveliest time of the year<br> now when the corn ripens.<br> You can go out without<br> asking anyone.<br> You can even play piano<br> if you want to.<br> Oh... Oh, but, Franz, you must<br> try to sleep now.<br> O God...<br> this is Franz Kemmerick...<br> only 19 years old.<br> He doesn't want to die.<br> Please don't let him die.<br> Paul.<br> - Paul.<br> - Franz.<br> Take my boots home<br> for Mueller.<br> Oh, no, Franz, no.<br> And if... Paul...<br> you find my watch,<br> send it home.<br> Franz!<br> Doctor! Doctor!<br> Doctor!<br> Doctor! Where's the doctor?<br> Why isn't there a doctor here?<br> Doctor, come quick!<br> - Franz Kemmerick is dying!<br> - Which one is that?<br> - Amputated leg.<br> - I've amputated a dozen legs today.<br> - Bed 26, sir.<br> - You see to it.<br> I'm due in the operating room.<br> One operating after another since<br> Sixteen dead today, and<br> yours is the 17th.<br> There'll probably be 20<br> by the morning.<br> You're looking good.<br> Very good today.<br> What's your hurry? Hey! I'll bet<br> he stole those boots!<br> I got it, Kat.<br> Listen: "The sum of an<br> arithmetic series...<br> is S = A + L x N over 2."<br> Interesting, isn't it?<br> What do you wanna learn<br> that stuff for?<br> One day you'll stop a bullet<br> and it'll all be worthless.<br> I get a lot of fun out of it.<br> My boots!<br> Mueller.<br> I saw him die.<br> I didn't know what it was like<br> to die before.<br> And then... then I<br> came outside...<br> and it felt...<br> it felt so good to be alive that<br> I started in to walk fast.<br> I began to think of the<br> strangest things...<br> like being out in the fields.<br> Things like that.<br> You know... girls.<br> And it felt as if<br> there were...<br> something electric running from<br> the ground up through me.<br> And I started. I began<br> to run hard.<br> I passed soldiers and I heard<br> voices calling to me.<br> I ran and I ran.<br> I felt as if I couldn't breathe<br> enough air into me.<br> And... And now I'm hungry.<br> I don't mind the war now.<br> Be a pleasure to go to the front<br> in boots like these.<br> It's a good invention<br> just the same.<br> If you crack each separate louse, think<br> of all the energy you use up. Watch.<br> Burned to death.<br> How was patrol? Bad?<br> Must've been terrible if they had<br> time to gather the harvest.<br> We passed a cherry tree and when<br> he saw it, he went crazy.<br> I could hardly drag him away.<br> It was... beautiful.<br> I have a big orchard with cherry<br> trees at home.<br> When they're in full blossom...<br> from the hayloft it looks<br> like one single sheet.<br> So white.<br> - Perhaps you can get leave soon.<br> - You may even be sent...<br> back as a farmer.<br> A woman can't run a farm alone.<br> That's no good, you know?<br> No matter how hard<br> she works.<br> Harvest coming on again.<br> What's the matter<br> with him?<br> Got a letter yesterday from his wife.<br> He wants to get back to his farm.<br> We'd all like to get<br> back home.<br> I wonder what we'd do if it were<br> suddenly peacetime again?<br> Get drunk and look<br> for women!<br> I'd go looking for<br> a Cinderella...<br> that could wear this<br> for a garter.<br> And when I'd found her, nobody'd<br> see me for two weeks.<br> I'll go back to the<br> peat fields...<br> and those pleasant hours<br> in the beer gardens.<br> And there's worse things<br> than cobbling too.<br> Look. My family.<br> I oughta give you a kick in the<br> backside for starting all this.<br> It's all right for all you to talk.<br> You've got something to go back to.<br> Wives, children, jobs.<br> But what about us? What have<br> we got to go back to?<br> - School?<br> - Why not?<br> You know everything already.<br> A man can't take all that rubbish<br> they teach you seriously...<br> after three years of<br> shells and bombs.<br> You can't peel that<br> off easily.<br> They never taught us anything<br> really useful...<br> like how to light a cigarette in the<br> wind or make a fire out of wet wood...<br> or bayonet a man in the belly instead<br> of the ribs where it gets jammed.<br> What can happen to us<br> afterwards?<br> I'll tell you. Take our class.<br> Out of 20, three are officers...<br> nine dead...<br> Mueller and three others<br> wounded...<br> and one in the madhouse.<br> We'll all be dead someday,<br> so let's forget it.<br> Hurry up! Get in there!<br> Hurry up!<br> Himmelstoss!<br> What's up?<br> - What are you, crazy?<br> - It's Himmelstoss!<br> Himmelstoss? There is justice<br> in the army!<br> Well, well. So, we are<br> all here, huh?<br> A bit longer than you,<br> Himmie.<br> Since when have we become<br> so familiar?<br> Stand up and click your heels<br> together! All of you!<br> - Take a running jump at yourself!<br> - Who's your friend?<br> Would somebody get General<br> Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?<br> I command you as your<br> superior officer!<br> - Do you want to be court-martialed?<br> - I do!<br> There's going to be a big<br> attack tonight...<br> and I'd just love to<br> get out of it.<br> Kiss my butt!<br> It isn't customary to ask for<br> salutes here.<br> But I'll tell you what we'll do.<br> We're going to attack a town that<br> we tried to take once before.<br> Many killed and many wounded.<br> It was great fun.<br> This time you're<br> going with us.<br> If any of us stops a bullet,<br> before we die...<br> we're going to come to you, click<br> our heels together and ask stiffly...<br> "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss,<br> may we go?"<br> You'll...<br> You'll pay for this,<br> you...<br> There it is.<br> Right on time. Better<br> get ready, boys.<br> I'm wounded!<br> I'm wounded!<br> It's just a scratch, you yellow rat!<br> Up! Get out with the others!<br> - Up!<br> - No! No! No!<br> You yellow rat!<br> Stinking yellow rat! Let the<br> others do it, eh?<br> Get up!<br> Get up!<br> Get up! Forward!<br> - Get out here.<br> - Command... was forward.<br> Command was forward!<br> Forward!<br> Forward! Forward!<br> Forward!<br> Forward!<br> Counterattack.<br> I want to help you.<br> I want to help you.<br> Stop that! Stop it, stop it.<br> I can bear the rest of it.<br> I can't listen to that!<br> Why do you take so long dying?<br> You're going to die anyway!<br> Oh, no.<br> Oh, no. You won't die.<br> Oh, no. You won't die. They're<br> only little wounds.<br> You'll get home. You'll be<br> all right.<br> You'll get home long<br> before I will.<br> You know I can't run away. That's<br> why you accuse me.<br> I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.<br> I tried to keep you alive.<br> If you jumped in here again,<br> I wouldn't do it.<br> When you jumped in here you were my<br> enemy, and I was afraid of you.<br> But you're just a man like me,<br> and I killed you.<br> Forgive me, comrade.<br> Say that for me. Say you<br> forgive me.<br> Oh, no. You're dead.<br> You're better off than I am.<br> You're through.<br> They can't do any more<br> to you now.<br> Oh, God, why did they<br> do this to us?<br> We only wanted to live,<br> you and I.<br> Why should they send us out<br> to fight each other?<br> If we threw away these rifles<br> and these uniforms...<br> you could be my brother just<br> like Kat and Albert.<br> You'll have to forgive me, comrade.<br> I'll do all I can.<br> I'll write to your parents.<br> I'll write to...<br> I'll write to your wife.<br> I'll write to her.<br> I promise she'll not want<br> for anything.<br> I'll help her and your<br> parents too.<br> Only forgive me.<br> Forgive me!<br> Forgive me. Forgive me.<br> Forgive me.<br> Terrible thing happened<br> yesterday.<br> I stabbed a man. With my own<br> hands, stabbed him.<br> I know how it is.<br> Your first time.<br> Never mind. The stretcher-bearers<br> will find him.<br> - He's dead. I watched him die.<br> - You couldn't do anything about it.<br> We have to kill. We<br> can't help it.<br> That's what we are here for.<br> Look there, for instance.<br> That got him. You should've seen how<br> he leaped in the air.<br> That fellow had to shoot with us<br> for today with three hits.<br> If he keeps it up, he'll have a<br> decoration for his...<br> buttonhole this evening.<br> Don't you lose any more sleep<br> over this business.<br> Maybe it was because I was out<br> there with him so long, huh?<br> Sure, that's it.<br> After all, war is war.<br> March! Forward!<br> Forward, march!<br> Quick there! Forward!<br> Company... halt!<br> Dismissed!<br> Uncommissioned officers,<br> enlisted men...<br> dismiss!<br> Come on! Let's get outta here!<br> - Give me your best sausage.<br> - Two.<br> Give me a beer.<br> One, two, three!<br> Hey, come on. A beer.<br> Hey, get out of here!<br> Come on. Give me a beer.<br> A beer. One b...<br> here's hoping we get falling-down<br> drunk tonight.<br> Here's how it started.<br> I'd forgotten there were<br> girls like that.<br> There aren't.<br> Just look at those thin,<br> little shoes.<br> She couldn't march many<br> miles in those.<br> Paul! Don't speak about marching.<br> You're boring the young lady.<br> A thousand pardons.<br> - How old you think she is?<br> - Oh, about 22.<br> No, that'd make her<br> older than us.<br> She's... 17.<br> A girl like that.<br> That'd be good,<br> Albert?<br> We wouldn't have much of a<br> chance with him around.<br> We could take a bath wash<br> our clothes...<br> All right.<br> And I might even go so far<br> as to get deloused.<br> Wait a minute! She's a long way<br> from here now.<br> Look at the date.<br> May, 1917.<br> - Four months ago.<br> - That's true.<br> Well, here's to her anyway.<br> Here's to them all,<br> everywhere.<br> Albert...<br> - We might as well wash up anyway.<br> - All right.<br> Personally, I like them<br> bigger around.<br> This conversation was on a high<br> moral plane up to now.<br> Now we do need a bath.<br> - A bath?<br> - For what?<br> You wouldn't understand.<br> This water is freezing. This romantic<br> business has gone too far.<br> Ahh, but think of her<br> beautiful eyes!<br> Oh, and her hair.<br> - Here we are!<br> - We're not gonna miss a thing!<br> Go away!<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Bathing!<br> They tell me there's some people in<br> this world takes a bath every week!<br> Women!<br> Mademoiselle, you want to swim?<br> Mademoiselle!<br> Aw, baby!<br> Aw, no, girls! Don't go away!<br> Aw, mama!<br> - Please don't go!<br> - Don't go away!<br> Food! Food!<br> Halt! You know you're forbidden<br> to cross.<br> You fellows stay on this side<br> or you'll get...<br> yourselves in a lot of trouble.<br> What are they jabbering<br> about?<br> They want us to swing over tonight.<br> They're expecting us.<br> - That's fine!<br> - We'll do it!<br> That blonde's crazy about me.<br> But there's four of us and<br> only three of them.<br> I was the one that<br> stopped them!<br> That blonde piece of work is mine.<br> You three fight for what's left.<br> Fight's the word. All's fair<br> in love and war.<br> What do you mean? What're<br> you gonna do?<br> You'll find out.<br> Au revoir!<br> Au revoir!<br> - C'est moi, blondie!<br> - Bon ami! Bon ami!<br> Vos camarades!<br> Vos camarades!<br> She means the door.<br> Not only modest, but dashing!<br> A perfect fit.<br> It might've been made for me.<br> An officer's coat.<br> We're calling distinguished<br> company.<br> Merci.<br> Have another little drink,<br> comrade.<br> Is this your birthday<br> or mine?<br> Why?<br> You've been buying me drink<br> after drink for two hours.<br> What I'm trying to figure<br> out is why.<br> Why?<br> Why?<br> Oh. I it's just that the boys...<br> told me to amuse you<br> for a little while.<br> Oh, nice boys.<br> They... They said you'd<br> understand.<br> I've been betrayed!<br> Yeah, you certainly have.<br> Take that for a minute!<br> I'll give you more!<br> It's too loud.<br> Suzanne. And I wouldn't even<br> know you if I did.<br> And yet, I'll remember<br> you always.<br> Toujours.<br> Oh, if you could only know how<br> different this is...<br> from the women we<br> soldiers meet.<br> You. That's what I'm<br> talking about. Vous.<br> It seems as though all war and<br> terror and grossness...<br> had fallen away from me...<br> like a miracle.<br> Like something I never believed.<br> Pauvre garon.<br> Pauvre garon.<br> Frau Paul.<br> We're going, Paul.<br> Have a look. Nice, new coffins.<br> Huh! For us.<br> I must say, that's a very cheerful<br> preparation for this offensive.<br> That's very considerate of them.<br> But I don't see any long...<br> enough for our comrade Tjaden.<br> Mind you, I'm not speaking<br> to you, you traitors.<br> - But no coffin's gonna get me.<br> - I should say not, heartbreaker.<br> You'll be thankful if they slip<br> a waterproof sheet...<br> around that Aunt Sally of a<br> carcass of yours.<br> Oh... Oh, my side!<br> My side.<br> Catholic hospital,<br> Albert.<br> They say you always get good<br> food and good treatment.<br> - We're lucky.<br> - After that rainy dressing station...<br> and 24 hours on the train, we<br> deserve to have some luck.<br> I'm Hamacher.<br> Yeah, that's my name.<br> I got a crack in the head and they<br> gave me a certificate stating...<br> "Josef Hamacher is<br> periodically...<br> not responsible for<br> his actions."<br> And ever since then, Hamacher has<br> been having a grand time.<br> I hope you boys are not too<br> badly wounded.<br> The others die off so quickly we<br> don't have time to get acquainted.<br> You'll get to know us...<br> very well.<br> Thank you.<br> You too.<br> I'm sorry, my dear. It's<br> time to go now.<br> Yes, sister.<br> Watch.<br> If they take his clothes away,<br> you've seen the last of him.<br> See? They're taking him to<br> the dying room.<br> Dying room?<br> When you're ready to kick the<br> bucket, they get you out...<br> of the way so they can<br> use the bed.<br> In the corner of the building<br> there's a little room...<br> right next to the morgue!<br> It's so convenient. It saves<br> a lot of trouble.<br> But suppose he gets well?<br> I've seen a lot of them go<br> in that dying room...<br> but nobody ever<br> comes back.<br> Sister.<br> Sister. Sister.<br> - Is that you ringing, Paul?<br> - Yes.<br> - Is something going on?<br> - I think I have a haemorrhage.<br> The bandage is all wet. I've been<br> ringing forever and nobody comes.<br> I think I'm bleeding.<br> Sister, get me a sterile dressing<br> and an ice pack.<br> - Why didn't someone call me?<br> - He's been ringing.<br> Nobody can walk, Sister.<br> - Sister, is it bad?<br> - No. No, we'll be all right.<br> We've got it in time.<br> What's the matter? What<br> are you doing?<br> We must rearrange<br> your bandages.<br> Where are you<br> taking me?<br> To the bandaging ward.<br> No, no! I'm not going!<br> I'm staying here!<br> Paul! Paul!<br> - Now, now!<br> - I'm not going to the dying room!<br> - We're going to the bandaging ward.<br> - Why are you taking my clothes?<br> You're lying to me! But I'll come<br> back. I won't die!<br> I'll come back!<br> I won't die!<br> I'll come back!<br> I won't die!<br> I'm not going to die!<br> I'll come back!<br> Sister Libertine, how is he?<br> Poor boy. They had to<br> amputate his leg.<br> Paul. Paul.<br> Paul.<br> Oh, he is...<br> gone.<br> Gone.<br> Hello. Welcome home,<br> Albert!<br> - How do you fell, kid?<br> - All right.<br> But I've got such<br> an awful pain.<br> My foot hur...<br> Hamacher. Did they cut<br> my leg off?<br> Of course not! How many did<br> you have? Two?<br> You still got them!<br> One, two!<br> Don't play the fool, Hamacher.<br> Tell me truthfully.<br> Of course not. And<br> you look fine.<br> Look. See?<br> - I won't be a cripple.<br> - Now, now.<br> - I won't live like that!<br> - Be calm.<br> I'll kill myself the first<br> chance I get!<br> Albert!<br> - I won't live! I won't live!<br> - Yes, you will.<br> Albert! Albert!<br> Albert, I've come back!<br> I told you I'd come back. Look,<br> everybody! I've come back!<br> Paul. Paul.<br> That's not where I'm going.<br> I live over there.<br> Paul, I'm so happy.<br> Hamacher, I've come back<br> from the dead!<br> It's most irregular. Never<br> happened before.<br> Albert, get well quickly...<br> so we can go home soon.<br> - Everything will be all right now.<br> - Yes, Paul.<br> Everything will be all right...<br> now.<br> Oh! Paul! Paul!<br> Paul.<br> - What's the matter, Paul?<br> - Nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> Paul.<br> Give me your hanky chief.<br> - Mother?<br> - Here I am, Paul. Here I am.<br> Mother's ill.<br> - Are you wounded?<br> - No, Mother. I got leave.<br> Here I am crying instead<br> of being glad.<br> Anna, get down the jar<br> of blackberries.<br> You still like them,<br> don't you?<br> Yes, Mother. I haven't had<br> any for a long time.<br> We might almost have known<br> you were coming.<br> - I'm making potato cakes.<br> - Don't let them burn.<br> Paul... sit down...<br> beside me.<br> My Paul.<br> My baby.<br> I almost forgot, Mother. I've got<br> some little presents for you.<br> Look, Mother. Bread,<br> sausage and rice.<br> Paul, you've been starving<br> yourself.<br> Hadn't I better go and tell<br> father Paul's home?<br> Paul could watch the things<br> on the stove.<br> No, I'm getting up.<br> Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now,<br> aren't you?<br> But somehow, I don't seem<br> to know you.<br> I'll take these off,<br> mother.<br> I'll get your suit. It's in the<br> wardrobe, just where you left it.<br> Are you really here,<br> Paul?<br> You won't...<br> You won't disappear,<br> will you?<br> No. I'm here.<br> Your things are ready<br> for you, Paul.<br> I remember when you<br> caught that one.<br> Yes. And you took it away from<br> me, didn't you?<br> Yes, I did.<br> We're behind the lines, but we know<br> how to honour the soldier...<br> who goes on in spite of<br> blood and death.<br> Gentlemen, my son.<br> - Prosit.<br> - Prosit.<br> Cheers.<br> I'm glad to know you, young man,<br> I am glad to know you.<br> How are things out there?<br> Terrible, eh? Terrible.<br> But we must carry on.<br> After all, you do at least get<br> decent food out there.<br> Naturally, it's worse here.<br> Naturally.<br> But the best for our soldiers all<br> the time. That's our motto.<br> The best for our soldiers.<br> But...<br> you must give the Frenchies<br> a good licking!<br> And, if you boys want to<br> come home...<br> let me show you what you must<br> do before you can come home.<br> Give us a hand there,<br> men.<br> Now, then, there's the line.<br> Runs so,<br> in a "V".<br> Here is St. Quentin. You can<br> see for yourself.<br> You're almost through now.<br> All right?<br> Shove ahead out there and<br> don't stick to that...<br> everlasting French warfare!<br> Smash through the johnnies! And<br> then you will have peace.<br> When you get in it... the war isn't<br> the way it looks back here.<br> Oh! You don't know<br> anything about it.<br> Of course, you know about<br> the details...<br> but this relates<br> to the whole!<br> You can't judge that.<br> Of course, you do your duty<br> and you risk your life.<br> But for that, you receive<br> the highest honour.<br> I said that every man in the war<br> ought to have the Iron cross.<br> First, the enemy lines must be<br> broken through in Flanders.<br> - On to Paris! Push on to Paris!<br> - Right.<br> No, not in Flanders. I'll tell you<br> just where the...<br> break should come.<br> Here.<br> The enemy has too many<br> reserves there.<br> - I insist upon Flanders!<br> - Why should they do that...<br> when they're halfway through<br> St. Quentin already?<br> Because Flanders is<br> a flat country!<br> - No mountains, no obstructions!<br> - There's too many rivers there!<br> From the farms they<br> have gone;...<br> from the schools, from<br> the factories.<br> They have gone bravely,<br> nobly, ever forward...<br> realizing there is no other duty<br> now but to save the fatherland.<br> Paul! How are you,<br> Paul?<br> Glad to see you,<br> Professor.<br> You've come at the right moment,<br> Baumer! Just at the right moment.<br> And as if to prove all have said,<br> here is one of the first to go.<br> A lad who sat before me on<br> these very benches...<br> who gave up all to serve in the<br> first year of the war...<br> one of the iron youth who have made<br> Germany invincible in the field.<br> Look at him... sturdy and bronze<br> and clear-eyed.<br> The kind of soldier every one<br> of you should envy.<br> Oh, lad, you must<br> speak to them.<br> You must tell them what it means<br> to serve your fatherland.<br> - No, I can't tell them anything.<br> - You must, Paul.<br> Just a word... Just tell them how<br> much they're needed out there.<br> Tell them why you went and<br> what it meant to you.<br> I can't say anything.<br> You can remember some deed of<br> heroism, some touch of nobility.<br> Tell about it.<br> I can't tell you anything<br> you don't know.<br> We live in the trenches<br> out there. We fight.<br> We try not to be killed,<br> sometimes we are.<br> That's all.<br> No. No, Paul.<br> I've been there! I know<br> what it's like.<br> That's not what one<br> dwells on, Paul.<br> I heard you in here reciting<br> that same old stuff...<br> making more iron men,<br> more young heroes.<br> You still think it's beautiful<br> and sweet to die...<br> for your country, don't you?<br> We used to think<br> you knew.<br> The first bombardment<br> taught us better.<br> It's dirty and painful to die<br> for your country.<br> When it comes to dying for<br> your country...<br> it's better not to die at all!<br> There are millions out there dying<br> for their countries...<br> and what good is it?<br> Paul!<br> You asked me to tell them how<br> much they're needed out there.<br> He tells you,<br> "Go out and die."<br> Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's<br> easier to say "Go out and die"<br> than it is to do it.<br> Coward!<br> And it's easier to say it than<br> to watch it happen.<br> No! No! Boys, boys!<br> - I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say...<br> - It's no use talking like this.<br> You won't know<br> what I mean.<br> Only, it's been a long while since we<br> enlisted out of this classroom.<br> So long I thought maybe the whole<br> world had learned by this time.<br> Only now they're sending babies,<br> and they won't last a week!<br> I shouldn't have come<br> on leave.<br> Up at the front you're alive or<br> you're dead, and that's all!<br> You can't fool anybody<br> about that very long.<br> Up there we know we're lost and done<br> for whether we're dead or alive.<br> Three years we've had<br> of it... four years.<br> Every day a year and every<br> night a century.<br> Our bodies are earth and our<br> thoughts are clay...<br> and we sleep and<br> eat with death.<br> We're done for because you<br> can't live that way...<br> and keep anything<br> inside you!<br> I shouldn't have come on leave.<br> I'll go back tomorrow.<br> I've got four days more, but<br> I can't stand it here!<br> I'll go back tomorrow!<br> Sorry.<br> Mother, you'll catch clod here.<br> You must go to sleep.<br> There'll be plenty of time<br> to sleep...<br> when you're gone.<br> Must you go tomorrow, Paul?<br> Must you?<br> Yes, Mother. Orders were<br> changed.<br> Are you very much afraid,<br> Paul?<br> No, Mother.<br> There's something I want to<br> say to you, Paul.<br> It's...<br> Just be on your guard against<br> the women out there.<br> They're no good.<br> Where we are, there aren't<br> any women, Mother.<br> Be very careful at the<br> front, Paul.<br> Yes, Mother,<br> I will.<br> I'll pray for you<br> every day.<br> And if you could, get a job that's<br> not quite so dangerous.<br> Yes, Mother. I'll try and get<br> in the cookhouse.<br> - That can easily be done.<br> - You do it then, and if...<br> - The others say anything...<br> - That won't worry me, Mother.<br> Now, you must go to bed and<br> you must get well...<br> quickly before I come back.<br> I put two sets of underwear...<br> new ones... in your pack.<br> They'll keep you nice<br> and warm.<br> They're all wool.<br> That's sweet of you.<br> Good night...<br> my son.<br> Good night,<br> Mother.<br> Oh, Mother, Mother.<br> You still think<br> I'm a child.<br> Why can't I put my head<br> in your lap and cry?<br> - Is this the 2nd Company?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Is this all of it?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> We had 150 men, but this is all<br> that came back yesterday.<br> But now they're going to give us<br> enough to make 150 again.<br> How old are you?<br> Sixteen.<br> No use. I couldn't<br> find anything.<br> We'll have to eat the<br> sawdust.<br> Not me! I'll go hungry first.<br> It makes me sick.<br> Now it's gonna be a<br> real war again.<br> Paul! How's old Paul?<br> Here I am.<br> You know, the 2nd Company's<br> getting hard to find.<br> Nobody seemed to know<br> where you were.<br> I'm glad you found it.<br> I guess I don't get<br> much of this.<br> There used to be some food in the<br> sawdust. Now it's all sawdust.<br> No joke, either. Eats ya<br> up inside.<br> This doesn't look much like<br> the old 2nd Company.<br> The replacements are<br> all like that.<br> Not even old enough to<br> carry a pack.<br> All they know how<br> to do is die.<br> I guess... some of the old-timers<br> are here yet.<br> Paul, they're trying to invent<br> something to kill me right now.<br> Where's Westhus?<br> Messenger dog was wounded.<br> He went out to get it.<br> - Is it true about the armistice?<br> - Doesn't look that way back there.<br> You mean they want us to<br> go on fighting?<br> That's what they say.<br> They're crazy!<br> Germany'll be empty<br> pretty soon.<br> Where is... Where is Detering?<br> He got homesick. You remember<br> about the cherry blossoms?<br> I guess he never got<br> over that.<br> He started out one night to go home<br> and help his wife with the farm.<br> They got him behind the lines, and<br> we never heard of him since.<br> He was just homesick, but probably<br> they couldn't see it that way.<br> Where's Kat? Is he...<br> Not Kat! If he were out, the<br> war would be over.<br> You remember what he always says:<br> They're saving him for the last.<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's out looking for food...<br> something to make<br> soup with.<br> - Which way?<br> - Down the road about...<br> two miles that way.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Kat!<br> Paul!<br> Hello, Paul.<br> - How's the side?<br> - Oh, it's all right now. It's fine.<br> - Have any luck?<br> - No, the general's staff's been...<br> over this country<br> with a rake.<br> Let's sit down there.<br> Tell me, Paul... how was<br> it at home?<br> Have a good leave?<br> - In spots.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I'm no good for back<br> there anymore, Kat.<br> None of us are. We've been<br> in this too long.<br> The young men thought I was a<br> coward because I told them that...<br> we learn that death is stronger<br> than duty to one's country.<br> The old men said<br> "Go on. Push on to Paris."<br> My father even wanted me to<br> wear my uniform around him.<br> It's not home back<br> there anymore.<br> All I could think of was, "I'd like<br> to get back and see Kat again."<br> You're all I've got left,<br> Kat.<br> I'm not much to have left.<br> I missed you, Paul.<br> At least we know what it's all about<br> out here. There're no lies here.<br> Push on to Paris?<br> You ought to see what they've<br> got on the other side.<br> They eat white bread<br> over there.<br> They've got dozens of<br> airplanes to our one...<br> and tanks that'll go<br> over anything.<br> What've we got left?<br> Guns so worn they drop shells<br> on our own men.<br> No food, no ammunition,<br> no officers.<br> Push on to Paris!<br> So that's the way they talk<br> back there.<br> I guess we'd better<br> be going.<br> How I lied to my<br> poor mother.<br> I told her it wasn't so bad<br> out here because there was...<br> always a lot of us together.<br> Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning<br> to believe that I told her the truth.<br> Down!<br> That's another one that missed us.<br> Come on. Let's go.<br> Wait a minute. Looks like the old<br> bread wagon's broke down.<br> I guess I don't walk the<br> rest of the way.<br> Did that get ya, Kat?<br> Aah, I think it broke my shin.<br> That's not so bad.<br> Hold it together.<br> - Just my luck?<br> - Good luck.<br> That means the war is over.<br> Oh, no, sir!<br> This war don't end till<br> they really get me.<br> Now this one...<br> Easy, now.<br> - Hey!<br> - Easy!<br> Easy!<br> Come on. I'll take you in.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Easy.<br> All right.<br> Well, kid... now we're gonna<br> be separated.<br> Maybe we can do something together<br> later on when the war is over.<br> Yes, kid.<br> You give me your address,<br> I'll give you mine.<br> You can't get both of us<br> in one day.<br> Ah, we'll surely see each<br> other again, Kat.<br> Remember that day when you brought<br> the whole pig into the factory?<br> And that day in the woods when you<br> taught us how to dodge shells?<br> And my first bombardment.<br> How I cried.<br> I was a young recruit then.<br> Here we are.<br> Here we are.<br> All right now, Kat.<br> You could've spared yourself<br> the trouble. He's dead.<br> Oh, no. He's just fainted.<br> He was hit in the shin.<br> He's dead.<br> Would you like to take<br> his pay book?<br> - You're not related, are you?<br> - No, we're not related.<br> Your deal. Get his name<br> and number?<br> Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus<br> Katczinsky, 306.<br> THE END<br>
