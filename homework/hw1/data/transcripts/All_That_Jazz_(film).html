Thank you, thank you. No, no...<br> You're wonderful, wonderful.<br> The word superstar is greatly<br> overused in this business.<br> But for my next guest, the word<br> superstar is totally inadequate.<br> Whenever l do a benefit-<br> and l've done 150, 60, 70, this year,<br> all for very worthy causes - l can always<br> count on this dude to be right there with me.<br> l feel humbled in his presence.<br> From deep, deep in here, ladies<br> and gentlemen, let me lay on you...<br> - A great entertainer.<br> - a great entertainer,<br> - A great humanitarian.<br> - a great humanitarian,<br> - And my dear friend for 25 years.<br> - and my dearest, dearest friend for 20 years.<br> - You missed by five years.<br> - Oh, boy, do l hate show business.<br> - Joey, you love show business.<br> - Tha's right, l love show business.<br> l'll go either way.<br> l got insight into you, Gideon.<br> You know wha's underneath?<br> The dreadful fear that you're ordinary,<br> not special.<br> Right.<br> Oh, l think...<br> l think...<br> - l'm getting an erection.<br> - Oh, Mr Gideon, don't do that.<br> That sex thing, Jesus. Listen,<br> l wouldn't say you were a faggot,<br> but you do have a lot<br> of feminine characteristics, right?<br> Right.<br> You are foolishly and childishly<br> flirting with disaster.<br> Joey, you're really crazy!<br> What do you wanna do, kill yourself?<br> Dr Ballinger told me to get a little exercise.<br> Everything he does seems<br> to be a denial of his condition.<br> Dr Ballinger, every time l've seen him,<br> l get the impression that<br> he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.<br> Yes, l know. But l think he cares a lot.<br> OK, we'll limit his visitors<br> to no more than two.<br> Joe, l wish you could have been there.<br> before a single review was out,<br> the line at Cinema One was around the<br> block. The people know. The people know.<br> This broke every first-day record.<br> l's a blockbuster. l mean a blockbuster.<br> And those guys in California...<br> You wouldn't believe the telephone calls.<br> "Congratulations", they say. "We're glad<br> you took your time. lt was worth it."<br> They said "Every dollar that we put<br> in that film is up there on the screen."<br> l'm telling you, they're talking about<br> a $3.5 million advertising budget.<br> Do you believe that? 3.5 million dollars. This<br> picture is gonna go right through the roof.<br> Right through... the roof.<br> Look at those reviews. See it?<br> We did it. Joe, we did it.<br> Where are the bad ones?<br> There are no bad ones.<br> Josh...<br> Well, there were a couple that<br> quibbled a little. l left them at the office.<br> Josh, l want you to do me a favour -<br> don't show them to me.<br> Never. How were the television reviews?<br> l think we got Leslie Perry.<br> At the screening, she told me she loved it.<br> Following Gideon's triumphant directorial<br> achievement with "50 Beautiful Girls, 50",<br> when he won every possible award,<br> it would be nice to report that<br> Mr Gideon's latest effort, "The Stand-up",<br> starring Davis Newman, was a better film.<br> Oh, boy, here it comes.<br> Joey, turn it off, please.<br> ... falls into his characteristic weakness<br> of trying too hard to please, to entertain.<br> - Josh, no. l wanna hear it.<br> - The razzle-dazzle sometimes obliterates...<br> - What does she know?<br> - She never gives a good review.<br> That woman is totally unqualified<br> to criticise anything.<br> - She doesn't know a damn thing about film.<br> - Or anything.<br> She's not even reviewing a film.<br> She's telling you how clever she is.<br> ... where the has-been comic,<br> played impeccably by Davis Newman,<br> demonstrates his former<br> brilliance in a monologue<br> where clearly director Gideon<br> gave Mr Newman free rein.<br> Rising above rather commonplace material,<br> the actor creates a classic comic...<br> l guarantee this picture<br> will do 30 million domestic, at least.<br> - One of you better get somebody.<br> - What?<br> l think l'm in trouble.<br> ... chopping off the ends of scenes<br> before the drama is played out,<br> left this reviewer with bewilderment<br> and a four-aspirin headache.<br> Using my four-balloon rating system,<br> l give "The Stand-up" haIf a balloon.<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - The truth? l'm scared.<br> Roll 'em.<br> Action. Oh, my God...<br> Ladies and gentlemen, the doctors.<br> l'm Dr Hyman, the internist.<br> l'm Dr Garry, the surgeon.<br> - l'm Dr Ballinger, the cardiologist.<br> - Five, six, seven, eight...<br> The heart is the viscus that maintains<br> the circulation of the blood.<br> That means he had total blockage in...<br> two arteries.<br> This is the man who would be<br> my first choice as a modern-day saint.<br> When l was in those marches, like Selma,<br> this brother was shufflin'<br> right alongside me,<br> long before those cats who thought<br> civil rights was a hip scene<br> and jumped on the blackwagon.<br> The blackwagon! Oh, ladies<br> and gentlemen, let me lay on ya...<br> - A great entertainer.<br> - a great entertainer,<br> - A great humanitarian.<br> - a great humanitarian,<br> - And my dearest friend.<br> - and my dearest friend<br> - Blah-blah.<br> - for 17 years.<br> - Ladies and gentlemen...<br> - See how much l learn from you?<br> - l'm afraid you've learned too much from me.<br> - There you are, Mr Gideon.<br> This is one of my A1,<br> first-rate, top-drawerjobs.<br> Tha's it. Good luck tomorrow.<br> What did you mean, l learned too much?<br> You're gonna make it. l'm hardly ever wrong.<br> Thanks.<br> Remember last Tuesday night?<br> lt was raining... very hard.<br> Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was raining. What about it?<br> l called you at midnight.<br> l must have been walking the dog.<br> l don't have time for this sort of thing.<br> You were with someone.<br> Yes.<br> And you made love to him.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, tha's it, huh? We're finished?<br> l don't know.<br> How do you feel about me?<br> l love you.<br> Then l guess we're not finished.<br> Because l really do love you, Katie.<br> - You mean that?<br> - Ah, hell, no.<br> l was pissed off at her.<br> l don't know. Yeah, l did mean it.<br> Sort of. Sometimes l don't know where<br> the bullshit ends and the truth begins.<br> l just wanted to say something nice to her.<br> Why?<br> ln case...<br> ln case...<br> ln case.<br> lf l die, l'm sorry for all<br> the bad things l did to ya.<br> And if l live, l'm sorry for all<br> the bad things l'm gonna do to you.<br> ...as stated in the declarations,<br> sustained directly as the result of injury,<br> sickness, death of, or permanent disability...<br> Excuse me, Mr Clark.<br> Larry, give me our figures.<br> Well, on an estimated<br> production budget of $941,000,<br> with a contingency of 59,000<br> to round it out to the million,<br> so far we're in for<br> at least two-thirds of the fees.<br> Design, 8,000, costumes, 8,000,<br> electrics, 4,000.<br> We're in for the full director-choreographer,<br> Construction of scenery, where more than<br> half has been done, tha's 125,000... plus.<br> Stage manager's about 8,000.<br> Press agent 1500, musicians about... two.<br> Assistants, secretaries, etc, 3,000.<br> Rehearsal halls and auditions... 9500.<br> Script and administrative, 1500.<br> Managers, l'd say... ten.<br> Advertising and printing, about 20,000.<br> Orchestrations, so far, around 10,000.<br> Legal, 10,000, auditing, 2,000,<br> payroll taxes... maybe seven.<br> Well, seven.

Tha's the figure l had here.<br> And change.<br> Let me try to understand.<br> Of that figure, how much do we recoup?<br> Yeah, l'm confused too. Do we<br> get all of that, or part of it, or what?<br> Simply, here are the options.<br> One, if Mr Gideon recovers<br> and you resume production within the<br> Two, if Mr Gideon should die and you resume<br> production with another director<br> within the 180 days, we are still not liable.<br> Three, however, if Mr Gideon<br> should expire before February 1,<br> and you abandon production,<br> we are liable for the full million dollars.<br> This means, gentlemen,<br> you could make a profit of...<br> $519,500.<br> You could be the first show on Broadway<br> to make a profit without really opening.<br> Well...<br> i's all very clear to me.<br> All this bullshit about death with dignity.<br> You know what death with dignity is,<br> man?
