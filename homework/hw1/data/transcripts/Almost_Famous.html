Do the story.<br> Who cares, you know?<br> It'll be good for ya.<br> Remember this: Don't do it<br> to make friends with people...<br> who are trying to use you...<br> to further the big business desire...<br> to glorify worthless rock stars<br> like Stillwater!<br> Dont let those<br> swill merchants rewrite you.<br> - "Swill merchants." That's good.<br> - Yeah, swill merchants.<br> - What are you listening to?<br> - Stillwater.<br> Stillwater?<br> Fucking kid's doing drugs.<br> No, no, no.

But I'm just gonna say this,<br> and I'm gonna stand by it:<br> You should be<br> really proud of him.<br> 'Cause I know men,<br> and I'll bet you do too.<br> He respects women,<br> and he likes women.<br> And let's just pause<br> and appreciate a man like that.<br> You created him out of thin air,<br> you know, you raised him right.<br> He's having a great time.<br> He's doing a good job.<br> And, don't worry, he's still a virgin,<br> and we're all looking out for him.<br> You know? That's more than I've<br> ever even said to my own parents.<br> So there you go.<br> This is the maid speaking,<br> by the way.<br> - Can you please hold it down?<br> - Sorry, ma'am!<br> Russell! So, what is it<br> you love about music?<br> Shut that thing off for a second<br> and I'll tell you the truth, all right?<br> Look... Fuck. I trust you,<br> so I'm just gonna lay this right on ya.<br> Just make us look cool.<br> I will quote you<br> warmly and accurately.<br> Well, that's what<br> I'm worried about.<br> Some of us...<br> we got girlfriends<br> back home, you know?<br> Some of us have wives.<br> And some of the people<br> that you meet on the road...<br> are really amazing people.<br> Like you.<br> But some of the stuff that happens,<br> it's good for...<br> a few people to know about,<br> as opposed to, say...<br> a million people.<br> - Understand what I'm trying to say?<br> - Yeah.<br> See, I grew up with these guys,<br> but I can't play all that I can play.<br> I'm past 'em,<br> as musicians, but...<br> the more popular we get,<br> the bigger their houses get...<br> the more responsibilities,<br> the pressure, you know...<br> The harder it gets<br> for me to walk out on them.<br> What am I doing?<br> I'm telling secrets to the one guy<br> you don't tell secrets to.<br> We'll do the interview tomorrow.<br> So tonight, it's...<br> Well, friends.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> - We trust ya.<br> Stinking Rhodes!<br> - Hey, what's going on?<br> - Russell just got electrocuted!<br> Come on!

Your shoddy stage setup<br> almost killed my guitarist!<br> You trashed my fucking dressing room,<br> and you didn't do your 25 minutes.<br> - Don't fuck with my band's safety, ever!<br> - Fuck you, man!<br> I'm gonna report you<br> to every promoter in this country!<br> What is that?<br> What are you, Bruce Lee?<br> Lock the gates!<br> - Motherfucker!<br> - Let's go through the fucking gate.<br> That's your last<br> fucking tour, man!<br> Lock the gates<br> on these fuckheads!<br> - Where's my goddamn cart?<br> - William?<br> I forgot to tell you.<br> Your mom called.<br> She says you gotta<br> call home immediately.<br> And she says to tell you,<br> "I know what's going on."<br> So, I'll see you guys<br> in Topeka, okay?<br> Amateurs!<br> You don't know who you're<br> dealing with here! Lock the gates!<br> - You wanna buy a gate?<br> - Yeah!<br> You just bought a gate!<br> Russell, wake up.<br> Wake up, man.<br> High school girls.<br> Goddamn!<br> Let it go.<br> Let it go, buddy.<br> When do we get in to Topeka, man?<br> - Larry, you're a sick individual.<br> - Wake up, man.<br> Look at all these fucking<br> tasty-looking high school girls.<br> We can't stop the bus<br> every time you see a girl in shorts.<br> Hey, when we go to Morocco...<br> I think we should wear<br> completely different clothes...<br> and be completely different people.<br> What will our names be?<br> What do you think of Russell?<br> I like him.<br> But that's between us.<br> Because I am a professional.<br> - You're coming to Cleveland, right?<br> - Oh, no.<br> I have to get my interview<br> with Russell before Greenville.<br> - You've got to help me, okay?<br> - Here's the thing about Russell.<br> He's my last project.<br> I only do this for a very few people,<br> and I think we should do it together.<br> Because all the guys are good,<br> but he could be great.<br> What's your real name?<br> All right, let's go!<br> Oh, it's okay.<br> I'm easy to forget.<br> Just leave me behind!<br> I'm only the fucking lead singer!<br> - You said you'd tell me where you were.<br> - Mom, I know!<br> You told me you would<br> call me twice a day.<br> - You told me you wouldn't miss tests.<br> - I'll be home for graduation.<br> - Mom...<br> - Where are you?<br> Right now, Topeka.<br> Then Greenville, then home.<br> What about graduation?<br> We had an agreement, William.<br> I'm sorry I didn't<br> call you yesterday.<br> I guess I just miss you,<br> and I don't understand...<br> why I've driven my two kids<br> so far away from me.<br> By all practical rules,<br> don't I get you for another three years?<br> Was I not fun?<br> Yes.<br> This is Beth from Denver.<br> She's one of the legendary,<br> original Band Aids.<br> - She's clairvoyant!<br> - I can't read your mind or anything.<br> I mean, I pick up things<br> here and there.<br> Estrella says hi.<br> - She says I can stay in your room.<br> - Sure.<br> Great. I've got some...<br> hydroponic pot!<br> Wow, your aura<br> is really fantastic!<br> - It's this beautiful purple color.<br> - I love you.<br> I missed the last thing you said.<br> - Your aura is purple!<br> - I love you.<br> - What?<br> - Purple! It's purple!<br> - Mom, what?<br> - Your aura is purple.<br> I miss you and I love you!<br> I love you.<br> All right.<br> Fire away. I'm ready.<br> Do you have to be depressed<br> to write a sad song?<br> Do you have to be in love<br> to write a love song?<br> Is the song better<br> if it really happened to you?<br> Like "Love Thing." Where did you<br> write that? Who is it about?<br> When did you get<br> so professional?<br> Gentlemen, your first<br> T-shirts have arrived.<br> It's the record company's mistake,<br> and they will pay.<br> T-shirts are gone.<br> Band happy, all right?<br> Can we just skip the vibe, and go<br> straight to us laughing about this?<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Because I can see by your face<br> you want to get into it.<br> How can you tell?<br> I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.<br> Here. Take it.<br> Let's take a good look at it,<br> all right?<br> See, you love this T-shirt.<br> It lets you say<br> everything you want to say.<br> Well, it speaks<br> pretty loudly to me.<br> It's a T-shirt.<br> Do you give a shit<br> about a T-shirt?<br> I'm just hungry, man. Let's just go out<br> and find some barbecue or something.<br> I'm always gonna<br> tell you the truth.<br> From the very beginning,<br> we said I'm the front man...<br> and you're the guitarist<br> with mystique.<br> That's the dynamic we agreed on.<br> Page, Plant, Mick, Keith...<br> but somehow it's all turning around.<br> We have got to control<br> what's happening!<br> - There's a responsibility here.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Didn't we all get into this<br> to avoid responsibility?<br> I can't say any more<br> with the writer here.<br> You can trust him.<br> Say what you want.<br> He won't write it.<br> I work as hard, or harder,<br> than anybody on that stage.<br> You know what I do?<br> I connect.<br> I get people off!<br> I look for the one guy<br> who isn't getting off...<br> and I make him get off.<br> Actually, that you can print!<br> And yet, why do I always end up<br> feeling like I'm a joke to you?<br> You want to pretend this isn't<br> gonna be a very big band? Well, it is!<br> You call yourself<br> a leader of this band...<br> but your direction<br> allowed this T-shirt...<br> when you allowed Dick<br> to manage us.<br> 'Cause he's your friend!<br> Don't you see, man?<br> The T-shirt is everything.<br> Is it my turn now?<br> Because I think we should, for once,<br> say what we really mean.<br> - This is the part where you quit!<br> - Right. I'm so predictable.<br> Deal with it.<br> And let me say<br> what nobody else wants to say.<br> - What?<br> - Your looks have become a problem!<br> All right, enough!<br> Break it up.<br> Everyone out of the room<br> for five minutes.<br> Hey! Yeah.<br> William. Sorry.<br> Come on, man. Come on.<br> Let's go find something real.<br> From here on out, I'm only interested<br> in what is real.<br> Real people, real feelings.<br> That's it.<br> That's all I'm interested in<br> from here on out.<br> You're real.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You know...<br> you know all about us,<br> and I don't know shit about you.<br> Tell me,<br> what's your family like?<br> My dad died of a heart attack...<br> and my sister believes<br> that my mom is so intense...<br> that she had to escape our family...<br> and they can't seem to find<br> a way to get through it.<br> I mean, they don't even speak<br> to each other anymore.<br> Plus, she gave me all her albums,<br> and now she's a stewardess?<br> It's good to talk about.<br> Really good.<br> But here I am telling secrets...<br> to the one guy youre not supposed to<br> tell your secrets to.<br> You're Russell from Stillwater.<br> Well, yeah, on my better days,<br> I am Russell from Stillwater.<br> Hey, you wanna go to a party with me<br> at my friend Aaron's house?<br> I mean, I know you're<br> a big rock star and all...<br> but do you wanna hang with some good<br> people looking to have a good time?<br> - We're just real Topeka people, man.<br> - Smoke some righteous weed.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You too.<br> Oh, my God! Holy shit!<br> Fuck!<br> I grew up with that lamp shade.<br> I love this kitchen.<br> I fucking love this kitchen!<br> That's William over there.<br> Hey, William!<br> You, Aaron,<br> are what it's all about.<br> You're real.<br> Your room is real.<br> Your friends are real.<br> Real, man, real.<br> You know? Real.<br> Real. You know?<br> You're more important<br> than all the silly machinery.<br> Silly machinery.<br> And you know it!<br> In eleven years, it's gonna be 1984, man.<br> Think about that!<br> Wanna see me feed a mouse<br> to my snake?<br> Yes.<br> Russell, we should probably<br> get back with the others.<br> - Oh, it's over, daddy.<br> - Hey...<br> there's acid in the beer<br> that's in the red cups.<br> That's wonderful.<br> Topeka. Check it out.<br> Please, don't give him any more acid.<br> Thank you.<br> Dick? Dick, I got him.<br> He's okay.<br> He is on acid, though.<br> I can't really tell.<br> How do you know when it's kicked in?<br> I am a golden god!<br> Yes, you are!<br> - I am a golden god!<br> - Hey, Russell!<br> Dont jump.<br> And you can tell<br> Rolling Stone magazine...<br> that my last words...<br> were...<br> I'm on drugs.<br> I think we should work<br> on those last words!<br> Okay.

Huh?<br> The Enemy?<br> Stop fucking looking at me!<br> Easy. Easy.<br> Don't worry. He only means half<br> of what he says.<br> Which half?<br> Dick, just help me get<br> my interview.<br> - I have to go home, Dick.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> - I have to go home.<br> - Look.<br> You saved the tour, and that's<br> good enough for now, all right?<br> - Come on, big fell, let's go.<br> - I hurt the flower.<br> Did you, man?

You got me?<br> Now, this isn't Creem magazine.<br> This is Rolling Stone.<br> We need this story in four days.<br> Now I wanna know how it's shaping up.<br> It's a think-piece<br> about a mid-level band...<br> struggling with their own limitations<br> in the harsh face of stardom.<br> That's great.<br> I like what we're saying.<br> Let me try and get you<br> a thousand more words.<br> Now, it's in consideration<br> for the cover...<br> but don't tell the band.<br> The cover of Rolling Stone magazine.<br> Crazy.<br> Crazy.<br> Some coffee.<br> Me too.<br> Greenville is so boring.<br> You know, any other city<br> in the world...<br> and you'd still be a virgin.<br> - Oh, God. Oh, God.<br> - What?<br> I've never written anything more<br> than a few pages in my whole life.<br> Don't worry, baby, you will.<br> I gotta find Russell.<br> I gotta find Russell.<br> Oh, will you take the laundry?<br> Take the laundry?<br> What am I to you?<br> Huh? Tell me.<br> Tell me right now.<br> What am I to you?<br> Excuse me, sir,<br> would you mind signing for this?<br> Good morning.<br> Please go the fuck away!<br> Hey, how you doing?<br> Hi.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Hi, welcome to Swingo's Celebrity Inn.<br> You must be Stillwater.<br> It's Bowie!<br> Hi, Mom. I'm in Cleveland.<br> Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.<br> I'm gonna fly back Monday morning.<br> No, no, no,<br> I'll only miss one test.<br> I'll be back for graduation.<br> Tell her youre a slave to the groove.<br> You cant help it.<br> Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.<br> I play guitar in Stillwater.<br> Hey, how does it feel<br> to be the mother of the greatest...<br> rock journalist we've met?<br> Hello?<br> Look, you got a great kid here.<br> There's nothing to worry about.<br> We're taking good care of him.<br> You should come to the show sometime.<br> - Hey, listen to me, mister.<br> - Join the circus.<br> Your charm doesn't work on me.<br> I'm onto you.<br> Oh, of course you like him.<br> Well, yeah.<br> He worships you people.<br> And that's fine by you<br> as long as he helps make you rich.<br> - Rich? I don't think so. We sit...<br> - Listen to me.<br> He's a smart, good-hearted<br> with infinite potential.<br> This is not some apron-wearing mother<br> you're speaking to.<br> I know about your Valhalla decadence,<br> and I shouldn't have let him go.<br> He's not ready for your world<br> of compromised values...<br> and diminished brain cells<br> that you throw away like confetti.<br> Am I speaking to you clearly?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - If you break his spirit...<br> harm him in any way...<br> keep him from his chosen profession,<br> which is law...<br> something you may not value,<br> but I do...<br> you will meet the voice<br> at the other end of this telephone.<br> And it will not be pretty.<br> Do we understand each other?<br> - Uh, yes, ma'am.<br> - I didn't ask for this role...<br> but I'll play it.<br> Now go do your best.<br> "Be bold and mighty forces<br> will come to your aid."<br> Goethe said that.<br> It's not too late for you to become<br> a person of substance, Russell.<br> Please get my son home safely.<br> You know, I'm glad we spoke.<br> Song and pong<br> it sounds like lots of fun<br> Won't you get on my back<br> for piggyback ride<br> Get on my back<br> for piggyback ride<br> - All right, boys.<br> - All right.<br> Your mom kind of freaked me out.<br> She means well.<br> From Troy, Michigan...<br> would you please welcome<br> to Cleveland...<br> Stillwater!<br> Father, Father<br> Tell me the story<br> tell me what to do<br> Doctor, Doctor<br> Is there a cure<br> for the young man's broken blues<br> And he said<br> Everybody knows<br> Yeah, you had to be there<br> Girl, you had to be there<br> Did you see that chick's shirt<br> in front of Russell?<br> When you play a great show<br> like tonight...<br> Okay, I need everyone's attention,<br> please.<br> Girls, I need five minutes<br> with the band alone.<br> Right.<br> Well, it seems the rumors are true.<br> The record company has sent<br> a big-time manager here...<br> to try and talk you<br> into replacing me.<br> His name is Dennis Hope.<br> I know you've all heard of him.<br> He's got all the big bands,<br> and he's outside right now...<br> and he wants five minutes with you.<br> And, well, I think<br> we've gotta do this.<br> - Well, send him in.<br> - Yeah, bring him in.<br> - We'll send him out on a rail!<br> - All right.<br> We'll finish the interview in Maryland.<br> You can fly home from Maryland, okay?<br> Hey, we've already got a manager.<br> He's been with us from the beginning.<br> Respectfully.<br> We all have our roots.<br> I believe in bands<br> holding on to their roots.<br> Those roots need to be augmented.<br> Your manager here<br> needs a manager.<br> Example... if you hadn't have run out<br> on your contract in Phoenix...<br> we could have sued<br> over Russell's hand.<br> But you left, negating the contract,<br> forfeiting the deposit.<br> You effectively traveled a long way<br> to pay that promoter to electrocute you.<br> Okay, your damages have put you<br> way in the hole for this tour.<br> Right now, you owe the record company<br> more than you've got.<br> But your record's selling.<br> There's money to be made.<br> So I brought a plane in. We could add<br> more shows to make up the difference.<br> - Respectfully.<br> - We travel by bus.<br> Doris is the soul of this band.<br> That bus has been our home since<br> we were the Jeff Bebe band. No way.<br> Hey, man, I'd travel on a pogo stick<br> if I thought we could make more money.<br> You could play more dates<br> with a plane.<br> Well, it's not about money. It's about<br> playing music and turning people on.<br> Clearly. Respectfully.<br> Why should we pay you for something<br> we can do ourselves?<br> Do you know how to keep<br> from getting charged...<br> for the ice below the floorboards<br> at Chicago Stadium?<br> Do you know how to do<br> a headlining tour?<br> Do you know how to get a record<br> not pressed, but played?<br> You gotta take what you can,<br> when you can, while you can...<br> and you gotta do it now.<br> That's what the big boys do.<br> Because if you think Mick Jagger'll<br> still be out there...<br> trying to be a rock star at age 50,<br> you're sadly, sadly mistaken.<br> I didn't invent the rainy day, man.<br> I just own the best umbrella.<br> I'm telling you, you're coming along at<br> a very dangerous time for rock and roll.<br> The war is over.<br> They won...<br> and they will ruin rock and roll...<br> and strangle everything<br> we love about it.<br> Put 'em up.<br> All right, money down.<br> One guy says, "I'll draw a picture<br> and you guess what it is, all right?"<br> - Can I help you?<br> - Is Russell Hammond here?<br> Hey, the Enemy!<br> Come on in, son.<br> Welcome to the road manager<br> poker party.<br> This game's been going on for two years.<br> Come on, find a spot.<br> - This is Mick. He's with The Who.<br> - How you doing?<br> This is Raymond. He's with the Eagles.<br> This is Reg. He's with Humble Pie.<br> - I think you know Red Dog.<br> - Hey, brother!<br> We've been developing this system<br> of poker over the years...<br> - so you can play it in any condition.<br> - Any.<br> - All right, I'm in.<br> - All right, all right.<br> Side proposition to the winner.<br> For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...<br> I'll throw into the pot<br> three lovely ladies...<br> including Miss Penny Lane<br> and the famous Band Aids...<br> who have to leave the tour<br> before New York.<br> - Is that okay with you?<br> - Russ is getting soft on us.<br> - Is that okay?<br> - Okay.<br> - It's a deal.<br> - Show 'em.<br> Three lovely ladies<br> in the custody of Humble Pie.<br> - Be good to 'em, Rich.<br> - We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.<br> All right.<br> - Joint?<br> - You know how I know this is good stuff?<br> - How's that?<br> - This is from Crosby.<br> - Is that the Crosby weed?<br> - Yeah, this is from Crosby.<br> - Oh, I'm in.<br> - I'm in.<br> Give me this.<br> Give me a light. I want fire.<br> Look, nobody's feelings<br> are getting hurt here.<br> She already knows that Leslie's coming<br> to New York tomorrow.<br> Everybody understands.<br> This is the circus.<br> Everybody's trying not to go home.<br> - Nobody's saying goodbye.<br> - Would you like some?<br> - I may.<br> - How many?<br> - Quit looking at me like that.<br> - You think you can fool me.<br> I can read you.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> - What's that?<br> - You're worried about me and Russell.<br> Yeah, I gotta work on that.<br> You're so sweet.<br> God, if there was more of you in him.<br> Don't tell me this stuff.<br> I wanna like him.<br> Did you miss your test or something?<br> - You have no idea.<br> - Look, I know I'm not on the plane.<br> I'm not going<br> on some other band's bus.<br> I could go with the Stillwater road crew<br> but that would be pathetic...<br> and the girls are all going<br> with Humble Pie.<br> So, if you could find out<br> from Russell...<br> Forget it.<br> I'm flying to New York myself.<br> I've got a bunch of partial tickets.<br> I know his ex-wife...<br> current girlfriend thing<br> is gonna be there.<br> I'm not sure that's a good idea.<br> What are you saying?<br> Did Russell say something?<br> - I don't know anything.<br> - Well, I know he wants me there.<br> Wake up!<br> Don't go to New York.<br> - Why are you yelling at me?<br> - I thought we were going to Morocco.<br> There is no Morocco.<br> There's never been a Morocco.<br> There's not even a Penny Lane.<br> I don't even know<br> your real name.<br> If I ever met a man<br> in the real world...<br> who looked at me<br> the way you just looked at me...<br> When and where<br> does this "real world" occur?<br> I mean, I am really confused here.<br> All these rules...<br> and all these sayings and nicknames.<br> Honey, you're too sweet<br> for rock and roll.<br> Sweet? Where do you get off?<br> Where do you get sweet?<br> I am dark and mysterious<br> and pissed off!<br> And I could be very dangerous<br> to all of you.<br> I am not sweet!<br> And you should know that about me.<br> I am the Enemy!<br> Look, you should be happy for me.<br> You don't know<br> what he says to me in private.<br> Maybe it is love,<br> as much as it can be for somebody...<br> Who sold you to Humble Pie<br> for 50 bucks and a case of beer?<br> I was there.<br> I was there!<br> Oh, God.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What kind of beer?<br> Welcome to New York!<br> It's okay to be nervous.<br> You should be nervous.<br> All you can do is be yourself...<br> and leave a pint of blood<br> on that stage.<br> We showed you America.<br> We did everything but get you laid.<br> No. Yeah?<br> I'm from the Church of Lenny. We bow<br> to his will and all it represents.<br> She's here.<br> - Can I have your autograph?<br> - Yep.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Jeffrey.<br> Room's fully stocked.<br> Air-conditioning's on.<br> - And, by the way, you look stunning.<br> - Thanks.

I slept with Marna, Dick.<br> - I did too.<br> I waited until you broke up with her,<br> but me too.<br> I also slept with Leslie,<br> when you were fighting.<br> - You slept with Jeff?<br> - Yeah, but it didn't count.<br> It was the summer we decided<br> to be free of all rules.<br> And you say you love me!<br> I don't love you, man.<br> I never did.<br> None of us love you.<br> You act above us.<br> You always have.<br> Finally, the truth.<br> You just held it over us,<br> like you might leave.<br> Like we're lucky to be with you.<br> And we had to live with it, man.<br> I had to live with you.<br> And now I might die with you,<br> and it's not fucking fair.<br> Please, enough!<br> And I'm still in love with you,<br> Leslie.<br> Oh, I don't wanna hear any more.<br> Shut up, Jeffrey!<br> - It's all happening.<br> - What the fuck!<br> - Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead.<br> - Don't be self-righteous, Russell.<br> Not now, man.<br> You were sleeping with Penny,<br> that fucking groupie...<br> Last summer up until yesterday.<br> Why don't you tell Leslie that?<br> - Shut up!<br> - I quit!<br> - I'm gonna kill you!<br> - I quit!<br> "That groupie"?<br> She was a Band Aid.<br> All she did was love your band.<br> And you all used her.<br> All of you.<br> You used her and threw her away.<br> She almost died last night<br> while you were with Bob Dylan.<br> You guys, you're always talking<br> about the fans, the fans, the fans.<br> She was your biggest fan.<br> And you threw her away.<br> And if you can't see that,<br> that's your biggest problem.<br> And I love her!<br> I love her!<br> Fuck it!<br> I'm...

You told me to send what I had.<br> It's not finished.<br> Give me tonight to work on it.<br> Oh, man, you made friends with 'em.<br> See, friendship is the booze<br> they feed you...<br> 'cause they want you to get drunk<br> and feel like you belong.<br> Well, it was fun.<br> Because they make you feel cool.<br> - And, hey, I met you. You are not cool.<br> - I know.<br> Even when I thought I was,<br> I knew I wasn't.<br> Because we are uncool.<br> While women will always be<br> a problem for guys like us...<br> most of the great art in the world<br> is about that very problem.<br> Good looking people...<br> they got no spine.<br> Their art never lasts.<br> They get the girls,<br> but we're smarter.<br> - Yeah, I can really see that now.<br> - Yeah, 'cause great artist about...<br> you know, guilt and longing...<br> and, you know,<br> love disguised as sex...<br> and sex disguised as love.<br> Hey, let's face it.<br> You got a big head start.<br> I'm glad you were home.<br> I'm always home.<br> I'm uncool.<br> - Me too.<br> - You're doing great, you know?<br> The only true currency<br> in this bankrupt world...<br> is what you share with someone else<br> when you're uncool.<br> Listen, my advice to you...<br> and I know you think<br> these guys are your friends...<br> if you wanna be a true friend to them...<br> be honest and unmerciful.<br> "I'm flying high<br> over Tupelo, Mississippi...<br> with America's hottest band...<br> and we're all about to die."<br> - Dark, lively.<br> - Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.<br> - Did this all really happen?<br> - I'll call and check the quotes.<br> Holy shit! I just got off the phone<br> with Rolling Stone.<br> They called me too.<br> What's he using?<br> All... he's using it all.<br> This, according to the "fact-checker."<br> So what?<br> "So what"?<br> We come off like amateurs...<br> Some average band trying to come<br> to grips with success...<br> Jealous and fighting<br> and breaking up.<br> We're buffoons.<br> "Rock and roll can save the world"?<br> "The chicks are great"?<br> I sound like a dick.<br> - You are a dick.<br> - I never said that.<br> Maybe we just don't see ourselves<br> the way we really are.<br> Is it that hard<br> to make us look cool?<br> This kid has you on acid screaming,<br> "I'm a golden god" from a fan's rooftop.<br> They used him to fuck us. They'll<br> probably just put you on the cover.<br> Wait.
