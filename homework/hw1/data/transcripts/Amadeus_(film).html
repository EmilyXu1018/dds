Do you want<br> to be a trained monkey?<br> You'd like me to drag you around,<br> doing tricks like a circus freak?"<br> How could I tell him...<br> ...what music meant to me?<br> While my father<br> prayed earnestly to God...<br> ... to protect commerce...<br> ... I would offer up...<br> ... secretly...<br> ... the proudest prayer<br> a boy could think of.<br> "Lord, make me a great composer."<br> "Let me celebrate your glory<br> through music...<br> ... and be celebrated myself."<br> "Make me famous through the world."<br> "Make me immortal."<br> "After I die...<br> ...let people speak my name<br> with love for what I wrote."<br> "In return...<br> ...I will give you my chastity...<br> ...my industry...<br> ...my deepest humility,<br> every hour of my life."<br> "Amen."<br> And do you know what happened?<br> A miracle!<br> My life changed forever.<br> I knew God had arranged it all.<br> That was obvious.<br> One minute I was a frustrated boy...<br> ...in an obscure little town.<br> The next I was here...<br> ...in Vienna, city of musicians...<br> ... and Emperor Joseph,<br> the musical king.<br> In a few years, I was his court<br> composer. Isn't that incredible?<br> Every night I sat with<br> the emperor of Austria...<br> ... playing duets with him...<br> ... correcting the royal sight-reading.<br> Actually, the man had no ear at all.<br> But what did it matter?<br> He adored my music.<br> Tell me...<br> If you had been me...<br> ...wouldn't you have thought<br> God had accepted your vow?<br> And believe me, I honored it.<br> I was a model of virtue.<br> I kept my hands off women.<br> I worked hours every day<br> teaching students, many for free!<br> Sitting on endless committees<br> to help poor musicians.<br> Work, that was all my life.<br> And it was wonderful.<br> Everybody liked me.<br> I liked myself.<br> Until he came.<br> He came to Vienna to play<br> some of his music...<br> ...at the residence<br> of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.<br> Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.<br> That night...<br> ... changed my life.<br> As I wandered through the salon...<br> ... I played a little game with myself.<br> This man had written<br> his first concerto at the age of 4...<br> ... his first symphony at 7,<br> a full-scale opera at 12!<br> Did it show?<br> Is talent like that...<br> ... written on the face?<br> Which one of them...<br> ... could he be?<br> Mozart is not here.<br> - Stop it!<br> - I am.<br> - Stop it!<br> - I am stopping it.<br> I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.<br> There. You see? I've stopped.<br> - Now we're going back.<br> - No!<br> Yes! You don't know where you are.<br> Here, everything goes backwards.<br> People walk and dance and sing<br> and even talk backwards.<br> - That's stupid.<br> - Why? People fart backwards.<br> Ssa-ym-ssik!<br> Ssa-ym-ssik!<br> Yes, you are. You are very sick.<br> No! Say it backwards, shitwit!<br> Ssa-ym-ssik.<br> Ssik, kiss.<br> Ym, my. Ssa.<br> Kiss my ass.<br> Em-yrram!<br> - I'm not playing!<br> - Say it, it's serious.<br> It's very serious.<br> Yrram.<br> Marry me.<br> I'm not gonna marry you.<br> You're a fiend.<br> Uoy-evol-I-tub.<br> Tub.<br> But I...<br> ...love...<br> But I love you?<br> - Tihs-ym-tae.<br> - What?<br> - Eat.<br> - Eat.<br> - Ym, my.<br> - My.<br> Tihs. Eat my shit.<br> You filthy fiend!<br> You filthy...!<br> My music.<br> They've started without me.<br> That was Mozart!<br> That giggling, dirty creature<br> I'd just seen crawling on the floor.<br> - I think that went well, don't you?<br> - Indeed.<br> The Viennese know good music,<br> don't you think?<br> Certainly.<br> Your Grace.<br> Ah, Mozart.<br> - Why?<br> - Why what, sir?<br> Why do I have to be humiliated<br> in front of my guests...<br> ...by one of my own servants?<br> The more license I allow you,<br> the more you take.<br> If His Grace is not satisfied,<br> he can dismiss me.<br> I wish you to return immediately<br> to Salzburg.<br> - Your father is waiting for you there.<br> - No, Your Grace!<br> I would prefer you dismissed me.<br> It's obvious I don't satisfy.<br> I have no intention of dismissing you.<br> You will remain in my service...<br> ...and learn your place.<br> On the page it looked...<br> Nothing!<br> The beginning simple, almost comic.<br> Just a pulse.<br> Bassoons, basset horns...<br> ...like a rusty squeezebox.<br> And then, suddenly...<br> ...high above it...<br> ...an oboe.<br> A single note, hanging there,<br> unwavering.<br> Until...<br> ...a clarinet took it over...<br> ...sweetened it into a phrase<br> of such delight.<br> This was no composition<br> by a performing monkey.<br> This was a music I had never heard.<br> Filled with such longing,<br> such unfulfillable longing.<br> It seemed to me I was hearing<br> the voice of God.<br> Excuse me.<br> But why?<br> Why would God choose an obscene child<br> to be his instrument?<br> It was not to be believed.<br> This piece had to be an accident.<br> It had to be.<br> It better be.<br> How good is he, this Mozart?<br> He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an<br> extraordinary opera of his last month.<br> -Idomeneo, King of Crete.<br> - That?<br> A tiresome piece. I heard it too.<br> Tiresome?<br> A young man trying to impress<br> beyond his abilities.<br> Too much spice.<br> Too many notes.<br> Majesty...<br> ...it was the most promising work<br> I've heard in years.<br> Then, we should make<br> some effort to acquire him.<br> We could use a good German composer<br> in Vienna, surely?<br> I'm sure he could be tempted<br> with the right offer. Say...<br> ...an opera in German<br> for our National Theater.<br> Excellent, sire!<br> But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.<br> Italian is the proper language<br> for opera.<br> All educated people agree on that.<br> What do you think, chamberlain?<br> In my opinion, it's time<br> we had a piece in our own language.<br> Plain German for plain people.<br> Kapellmeister?<br> Majesty...<br> ...I must agree with "Herr Direttore".<br> German is...<br> ...too brute for singing.<br> Court composer...<br> ...what do you think?<br> I think it's an interesting notion<br> to keep Mozart in Vienna.<br> It should infuriate the archbishop...<br> ...if that is Your Majesty's<br> intention.<br> You are "cattivo", court composer.<br> I want to meet this young man.<br> Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.<br> Well, there it is!<br> This is a beautiful wig for you.<br> It looks so marvelous and I love it.<br> The other one.<br> Here is the other one.<br> I think you will love it.<br> Here's the third one. So? Here we go.<br> - How do you like it?<br> - They're all so beautiful!<br> Why don't I have three heads?<br> This is funny!<br> Three heads!<br> Gentlemen.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Morning, Your Majesty.<br> What do you have for me today?<br> - Your Majesty, "Herr Mozart".<br> - Yes, what about him?<br> He's here.<br> Well, there it is. Good!<br> I hope you won't find it improper,<br> but I've written a march in his honor.<br> What a charming idea, court composer.<br> May I see?<br> Just a...<br> Just a trifle, of course.<br> May I try it?<br> Let's have some fun.<br> Delightful, court composer!<br> May I play it when he comes in?<br> - You do me too much honor.<br> - Bring in "Herr Mozart".<br> But slowly.<br> I need a minute to practice.<br> Good, continue.<br> G, Majesty.<br> Excellent!<br> Good, Majesty.<br> Continue. Very good.<br> Very good, Majesty.<br> Tempo! Up.<br> Lightly, then strongly!<br> It's a march, Majesty.<br> Again.<br> Bravo, Majesty!<br> Gentlemen, please.<br> A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.<br> No, please. It's not a holy relic.<br> You know, we have met before.<br> In this very room.<br> You don't recall. You were only 6.<br> He was giving a delightful concert!<br> As he got off the stool, he fell.<br> My sister Antoinette helped him up.<br> Know what he did?<br> He jumped into her arms and said,<br> "Will you marry me? Yes or no?"<br> You know all these gentlemen.<br> The Baron Van Swieten.<br> - I'm a great admirer of yours.<br> - Thank you.<br> Kapellmeister Bonno.<br> My pleasure.<br> The Director of Opera,<br> Count Orsini-Rosenberg.<br> Sir, yes. The honor is mine,<br> absolutely!<br> Here is our<br> illustrious court composer...<br> ...Maestro Salieri.<br> At last, such immense joy!<br> I know your work well.<br> You know, I composed some variations<br> on a melody of yours.<br> - Really? Which one?<br> - "Mio Caro Adone."<br> I'm flattered.<br> A funny tune,<br> but it yielded good things.<br> And now he has returned<br> the compliment.<br> "Herr Salieri" composed<br> this little march for you.<br> Really?<br> Well, there it is.<br> Down to business. We're going<br> to commission an opera from you.<br> What do you say?<br> Did we vote in the end<br> for German or Italian?<br> Sire, if you remember,<br> we did finally incline to Italian.<br> Did we?<br> I don't think it was really decided,<br> Your Majesty.<br> - German. Please let it be German.<br> - Why so?<br> Because I've already found<br> the most wonderful libretto.<br> Have I seen it?<br> I don't think you have, "Herr Direktor".<br> It's quite new.<br> - I'll show it to you immediately.<br> - I think you'd better.<br> Well...<br> ...tell us about it.<br> Tell us the story.<br> Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.<br> It's set...<br> The whole thing is set in a...<br> Yes? Where?<br> In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.<br> - You mean in Turkey?<br> - Yes, exactly.<br> Then why especially<br> does it have to be in German?<br> It doesn't, especially. It could be<br> in Turkish if you really want.<br> No, my dear fellow, the language<br> is not finally the point.<br> Do you really think that subject<br> is appropriate for a national theater?<br> Why not? It's charming.<br> I mean, I won't actually show<br> concubines exposing their...<br> It's not indecent.<br> It's highly moral, Majesty.<br> It's full of proper German virtues.<br> Excuse me, Majesty, but what<br> do you think these could be?<br> Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.<br> Well, tell him, Mozart.<br> Name us a German virtue.<br> - Love, sire.<br> - Oh, love!<br> Of course, in Italy<br> we know nothing about love.<br> No, I don't think you do.<br> Watching Italian opera,<br> all those male sopranos screeching...<br> ...stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes<br> about. That's not love. It's rubbish!<br> Majesty, you choose the language.<br> I'll set it to the finest music<br> ever offered a monarch.<br> Well, there it is.<br> Let it be German.<br> This is yours.<br> Keep it.<br> It's already here in my head.<br> What? On one hearing only?<br> I think so, sire. Yes.<br> Show us.<br> The rest is just the same, isn't it?<br> That doesn't really work, does it?<br> Did you try...?<br> Shouldn't it be a bit more...?<br> Or this?<br> This. Yes.<br> Better? What do you think?<br> Grazie, Signore.<br> All I ever wanted<br> was to sing to God.<br> He gave me that longing...<br> ...and then made me mute. Why?<br> Tell me that.<br> If he didn't want me<br> to praise him with music...<br> ...why implant the desire...<br> ...like a lust in my body?<br> And then deny me the talent?<br> Madame Cavalieri is here<br> for her lesson, sir.<br> Maestro.<br> Well...?<br> How do you like it?<br> It's Turkish.<br> My hairdresser said everything<br> this year's going to be Turkish.<br> Does he?<br> What else did he tell you today?<br> Come, come! Give me some gossip.<br> Well, I heard you met "Herr Mozart".<br> News travels fast in Vienna.<br> And he's been commissioned<br> to write an opera. Is it true?<br> - Yes.<br> - Is there a part in it for me?<br> - No.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Do you know where it's set, my dear?<br> - Where?<br> In a harem.<br> - What's that?<br> - A brothel.<br> Come.<br> Let's begin.<br> - What does he look like?<br> - Mozart?<br> - You might be disappointed.<br> - Why?<br> Looks and talent don't always<br> go together, Katerina.<br> Looks don't concern me, maestro.<br> Only talent interests<br> a woman of taste.<br> Shall we continue?<br> There she was.<br> I don't know where they met or how.<br> There she stood!<br> On stage, for all to see.<br> Showing off like<br> the greedy songbird she was.<br> Ten minutes of ghastly scales.<br> Arpeggios!<br> Whizzing up and down<br> like fireworks at a fairground.<br> Understand, I was<br> in love with the girl.<br> Or at least in lust.<br> And I swear to you,<br> I never laid a finger on her.<br> All the same, I couldn't bear<br> to think of anyone else touching her.<br> Least of all, "the creature".<br> Brava, madame!<br> You are an ornament to our stage.<br> Your Majesty.<br> Well, "Herr Mozart". A good effort.<br> Well, decidedly that.<br> An excellent effort!<br> You have shown us something...<br> ...quite new tonight.<br> - It is new.<br> - It is, isn't it, sire?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> So then, you liked it?<br> You really liked it, sire?<br> Well, of course I did! It's very good!<br> Of course, now and then,<br> just now and then...<br> ...it seemed a touch...<br> What do you mean, sire?<br> Well, I mean, occasionally,<br> it seems to have...<br> How shall one say...?<br> How shall one say, "direktor"?<br> - Too many notes, Majesty?<br> - Exactly. Very well put.<br> - Too many notes.<br> - I don't understand.<br> There are just as many notes<br> as I required, neither more nor less.<br> My dear fellow, there are in fact...<br> ...only so many notes<br> the ear can hear in an evening.<br> I think I'm right in saying that,<br> aren't I, court composer?<br> Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.<br> This is absurd!<br> Young man, don't take it too hard.<br> Your work is ingenious.<br> It's quality work.<br> And there are simply too many notes.<br> Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.<br> Which few did you have in mind?<br> Wolfgang!<br> Wolfgang, my dear!<br> - Wolfgang!<br> - Majesty, this is "Frau Weber".<br> She's my landlady.<br> - Enchanted, madame.<br> - Sire, such an honor!<br> This is my dear daughter, Constanze.<br> - She's the fiance of "Herr Mozart".<br> - Really?<br> How charming. Please.<br> Well...<br> ...when do you marry?<br> We haven't exactly received<br> my father's consent yet.<br> Not entirely. Not altogether.<br> - Excuse me, but how old are you?<br> - 26.<br> My advice is for you to marry<br> this charming young lady...<br> ...and stay with us in Vienna.<br> - You see?<br> I told him that,<br> but he won't listen to me.<br> Your Majesty,<br> you give such wonderful...<br> ...such royal advice. May I...?<br> Well, there it is.<br> Wolfie, will you get some water?<br> Will you get some water, please?<br> Wolfie, get some water!<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> Did you know?<br> - What?<br> - The marriage.<br> What does it matter to you?<br> Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,<br> I don't give a damn.<br> How was I?<br> You were sublime.<br> And what did you think of the music?<br> Extremely clever.<br> Katerina, I...<br> Excuse me.<br> Is that woman still lying<br> on the floor?<br> - No, she's fine.<br> - Oh, I'm so relieved.<br> Dear Mozart,<br> my sincere congratulations.<br> - Did you like it then?<br> - How could I not?<br> It's the best music<br> in Vienna today, don't you agree?<br> She must be dazzling in bed.<br> I assume she's the virtuoso<br> in that department.<br> No other reason why<br> you'd marry someone like that.<br> Come in.<br> Excuse me.<br> Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.<br> - Can we go home?<br> - Yes.<br> No, no, no.<br> You can't take him away now.<br> This is his night.<br> Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?<br> Excuse us, "Frulein".<br> Good night, "signore".<br> At that moment I knew,<br> beyond any doubt...<br> ... he'd had her.<br> The creature had had my darling girl.<br> It was incomprehensible!<br> What was God up to?<br> Was it possible I was being tested?<br> Was God expecting me<br> to offer forgiveness...<br> ...in the face of every offense?<br> No matter how painful?<br> It's very possible.<br> But why him?<br> Why choose Mozart<br> to teach me lessons in humility?<br> My heart was filling up...<br> ...with such hatred<br> for that little man.<br> For the first time in my life,<br> I began to know...<br> ...really...<br> ...violent thoughts.<br> Every day, sometimes for hours,<br> I would pray.<br> Lord...<br> ...please...<br> ...send him away...<br> ...back to Salzburg.<br> For his sake...<br> ...as well as mine.<br> - No! I won't have him back.<br> - But, Your Grace...<br> Your son is an unprincipled,<br> spoiled, conceited brat!<br> Yes, sir...<br> ...that is the truth.<br> But don't blame him.<br> The fault is mine, entirely.<br> I was too indulgent with him.<br> Please, Your Grace?<br> Give him one more chance?<br> You have leave to try.<br> God bless, Your Grace!<br> I thank Your Grace.<br> I thank you!<br> I write to you with urgent news.<br> I'm coming to Vienna.<br> Take no further steps<br> towards marriage until we meet.<br> As you honor the father who has<br> devoted his life to yours...<br> ... do as I bid, and await my coming.<br> I now join you<br> in the holy bonds of matrimony.<br> Those whom God hath joined together...<br> ...let no man put asunder.<br> Beloved father:<br> You say Vienna is the musicians' city.<br> To conquer here is to conquer Europe.<br> With my wife I can do it.<br> One day, when I'm wealthy...<br> ... you'll live with us,<br> and we'll be so happy.<br> Good morning.<br> This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.<br> Your Highness.<br> She's asked me to recommend<br> a music instructor.<br> - I've come up with an excellent idea.<br> - Your Majesty!<br> It would be such a tremendous honor!<br> I was thinking of "Herr Mozart".<br> What is your view?<br> It's an interesting idea,<br> Majesty, but...<br> Yes?<br> My concern is to protect you...<br> ...from any hint of favoritism.<br> Favoritism.<br> - What is this?<br> - What is what?<br> Why must I submit samples of my work<br> to a committee to teach a girl?<br> Because His Majesty wishes it.<br> Is the emperor angry with me?<br> - Quite the contrary.<br> - Then why not appoint me to the post?<br> You are not<br> the only composer in Vienna.<br> No. But I'm the best.<br> Mozart.<br> A little modesty<br> might suit you better.<br> Who is on this committee?<br> Kapellmeister Bonno, Count<br> Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.<br> Naturally, the Italians!<br> Of course, always the Italians!<br> They're all musical idiots!<br> - And you want them to judge my music?<br> - Young man...<br> ...the issue is quite simple.<br> If you want this position...<br> ...you must submit your stuff,<br> along with all your colleagues.<br> Must I?<br> Well, I won't.<br> How are we supposed to live?<br> Do you want me to beg on the streets?<br> Don't be stupid.<br> - All they want to see is your work.<br> - Shit.<br> - What's wrong with that?<br> - Shut up! Just shut up.<br> One royal pupil,<br> and all of Vienna will come flocking.<br> They'll come anyway.<br> - No, they won't.<br> - They love me here.<br> - I know how things work in this city.<br> - You know everything, don't you?<br> - Yes?<br> - Excuse me, sir.<br> - A lady insists on talking to you.<br> - Who?<br> She didn't say,<br> but she says it's urgent.<br> Excuse me, my dear.<br> Your Excellency.<br> How can I help you?<br> - Frau Mozart?<br> - I've come on behalf of my husband.<br> I brought samples of his work so he<br> can be considered for the appointment.<br> How charming,<br> but why did he not come himself?<br> Well, he's terribly busy, sir.<br> I understand.<br> I will look at them the moment I can.<br> It will be an honor.<br> Please give him my warmest regards.<br> Would it be too much trouble<br> to ask you to look at them now?<br> - While I wait.<br> - I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...<br> ...this precise moment.<br> Leave them with me.<br> I assure you, they will be safe.<br> I really cannot do that, sir.<br> You see, he doesn't know I'm here.<br> Then he didn't send you?<br> No, sir. This was my own idea.<br> - I see.<br> - Sir, we're desperate.<br> We really need this job.<br> My husband spends far more<br> than he can ever earn.<br> I don't mean that he's lazy,<br> because he works all day long.<br> It's just that he's not practical.<br> Money simply slips through<br> his fingers. It's ridiculous.<br> Let me offer you some refreshment.<br> Do you know what these are?<br> "Capezzoli di Venere"!<br> Nipples of Venus.<br> They're Roman chestnuts in brandied<br> sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!<br> They're quite surprising.<br> They're wonderful!<br> Thank you very much, Your Excellency.<br> Don't keep calling me that.<br> Keeps me at such a distance.<br> I wasn't born a court composer,<br> you know.<br> I'm from a small town.<br> Just like your husband.<br> Are you sure you can't...<br> ...leave this and come back again?<br> It's very tempting, sir.<br> But it's impossible, I'm afraid.<br> He'd be frantic<br> if he knew they were missing.<br> You see, they're all originals.<br> - Originals?<br> - Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.<br> These...<br> ...are originals?<br> Astounding!<br> It was actually...<br> It was beyond belief.<br> These were first and only...<br> ... drafts of music.<br> But they showed no corrections<br> of any kind. Not one.<br> He had simply written down music...<br> ...already finished in his head.<br> Page after page of it.<br> As if he were just taking dictation.<br> And music...<br> ...finished as no music<br> is ever finished.<br> Displace one note...<br> ...and there would be diminishment.<br> Displace one phrase,<br> and the structure would fall.<br> It was clear to me...<br> ... that sound I had heard<br> in the archbishop's palace...<br> ... had been no accident.<br> Here again<br> was the very voice of God.<br> I was staring through the cage...<br> ...of those meticulous ink strokes...<br> ...at an absolute beauty.<br> Is it not good?<br> It is miraculous.<br> Yes, he's very proud of his work.<br> So you will help us?<br> I dine with the emperor<br> tomorrow evening.<br> One word from me and the post is his.<br> Thank you, Your Excellency!<br> Thank you!<br> Come back tonight.<br> - Tonight?<br> - Alone.<br> What for?<br> Some service<br> deserves service in return.<br> No?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Isn't it obvious?<br> It's a post all Vienna seeks.<br> If you wish it for your husband,<br> come tonight.<br> I'm a married woman, sir.<br> Then don't.<br> It's up to you.<br> And not to be vague,<br> that is the price.<br> There is no God of mercy, Father.<br> Just a God of torture.<br> Evening came.<br> I sat there, not knowing<br> whether she would return or not.<br> I prayed as I had<br> never prayed before.<br> Dear God...<br> ... enter me now.<br> Fill me with one piece of true music.<br> One piece with your breath in it,<br> so I know that you love me.<br> Show me one sign of your favor,<br> and I will show mine to Mozart.<br> I will get him the royal position.<br> Enter me.<br> Please.<br> Please!<br> Yes?<br> That lady is back, sir.<br> Show her in.<br> Well?<br> I'm here.<br> My husband has gone to a concert.<br> He didn't think I would enjoy it.<br> Well, where shall we go?<br> Should we stay here?<br> Well...<br> Do you still want to look at these?<br> Or don't we need to bother anymore?<br> Suppose we don't, really.<br> Show this woman out.<br> Stanzi.<br> Stanzi.<br> What is it?<br> What's the matter? Tell me.<br> Tell me.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> From now on, we are enemies.<br> You and I.<br> Because you choose<br> for your instrument...<br> ... a boastful, lustful,<br> smutty, infantile boy...<br> ... and give me for reward only the<br> ability to recognize the incarnation.<br> Because you are unjust...<br> ... unfair...<br> ... unkind...<br> ... I will block you.<br> I swear it.<br> I will hinder and harm<br> your creature on earth...<br> ... as far as I am able.<br> I don't like to talk<br> against a fellow musician.<br> Of course not.<br> I have to tell you.<br> Mozart is not entirely to be trusted<br> alone with young ladies.<br> Really?<br> One of my own pupils,<br> a very young singer...<br> ...Maria Theresa Paradis...<br> ...told me she was...<br> Well...<br> Well, what?<br> Molested, Majesty.<br> Twice, in the course of<br> the same lesson.<br> There is a "Herr Mozart"<br> waiting for you in the salon.<br> - Whom did they choose?<br> - Herr Zummer.<br> Herr Zummer?<br> But the man's a fool!<br> He's a total mediocrity.<br> No, no. He has yet<br> to achieve mediocrity.<br> I can't lose this post.<br> I simply can't.<br> Excellency, please.<br> Let's go to the palace.<br> You can talk to the emperor...<br> ...and tell him that "Herr Zummer"<br> is an awful choice.<br> He could do musical harm<br> to the princess.<br> Between us, no one in the world<br> could do musical harm to the princess.<br> Look...<br> ...I must have pupils.<br> Without pupils, I can't manage.<br> You don't mean<br> you're living in poverty?<br> No, but I'm broke.<br> Well, how is this possible?<br> I hear your concerts are<br> quite successful.<br> They're stupendously successful.<br> You can't get a seat.<br> But no one will hire me.<br> They want to hear me play...<br> ...but they won't let me teach<br> their daughters, as if I was a fiend.<br> Seriously...<br> ...is there any chance<br> you could manage a loan?<br> Only for six months.<br> Eight, at the most.<br> You expect your fortunes to change<br> in six or eight months?<br> As a matter of fact, I do.<br> I am working on something that will<br> explode like a bomb all over Europe.<br> I'll be the richest man in Vienna.<br> I'll pay you back double. Anything.<br> You name the terms.<br> Well, how exciting.<br> Tell me more.<br> - It's a bit of a secret.<br> - Come, come. I'm interested.<br> This is delicious. What is it?<br> It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...<br> ...suffused with rum.<br> Crema Mascarpone Speciale.<br> Italian.<br> Forgive me. We all have<br> patriotic feelings of some kind.<br> Two thou...<br> Two hundred florins.<br> That's all I need.<br> A hundred.<br> Fifty.<br> What exactly are you working on?<br> Really, I can't say.<br> I don't think you should become known<br> in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.<br> However...<br> ...I know a distinguished<br> gentleman I can recommend, and...<br> ...he has a daughter.<br> Quiet! Quiet!<br> Herr Mozart.<br> Welcome. Pay no attention,<br> they're impossible.<br> I treat them just like<br> my own children.<br> Which of them do you wish me to teach?<br> That's funny.<br> You're a funny fellow.<br> This is the instrument.<br> I hope it's to your satisfaction.<br> Of course it'll be<br> to his satisfaction.<br> Come, we're going to listen<br> to some music. Come!<br> Good boy.<br> Now.<br> Please play me something,<br> just to give me an idea.<br> Anything will do.<br> Just go ahead.<br> Just as if we weren't here.<br> Part of music, getting used<br> to an audience. Right, "Herr Mozart"?<br> Perhaps it would be better<br> if we were left alone.<br> We're both a little shy.<br> Play.<br> - I said play!<br> - Michael, please.<br> Perhaps if I play first,<br> it might encourage the "Frulein".<br> Why don't you let me try?<br> Stop it! Stop!<br> He always howls when he hears music.<br> We've got to break him of that habit.<br> We've got to break them<br> of their habit!<br> Play. Please.<br> "Herr Mozart", play. Please, I beg you.<br> That's it. That's it.<br> Keep playing!<br> Keep playing! That's it!<br> Mozart, that's wonderful!<br> Wonderful!<br> Next time you wish me to instruct<br> another of your dogs, let me know.<br> Goodbye, "Frulein". Goodbye, madam.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> Papa?<br> Papa!<br> Why are you here?<br> Am I not welcome?<br> Of course, welcome.<br> Papa, welcome! Welcome!<br> You're very thin.<br> Doesn't your wife feed you?<br> Of course she feeds me.<br> She stuffs me like a goose all day!<br> - Is she not here?<br> - No, she had to help her mother.<br> She's like that.<br> Her mother's a very<br> sweet woman, you'll...<br> I didn't know you were home.<br> Stanzi, this is my father.<br> We'll wait. We'll wait.<br> Why don't you get up now, my darling?<br> She's very tired, poor creature.<br> You know me. I'm such a pig.<br> It's not easy cleaning up after me.<br> Don't you have a maid?<br> Oh. No. We could if we wanted...<br> ...but Stanzi insists on doing<br> everything herself.<br> How is your...<br> ...financial situation?<br> Couldn't be better.<br> That's not what I hear.<br> What do you mean? It's wonderful.<br> Really, it's marvelous!<br> People love me here.<br> They say you have debts.<br> Who?<br> Who says that?<br> That's a malicious lie!<br> Do you have pupils?<br> I don't want pupils!<br> They get in the way.<br> I have to have time for composition.<br> Composition doesn't pay.<br> You know that.<br> That one will.<br> What's that?<br> It's a secret.<br> Secret?<br> You don't have secrets from me.<br> No! Please! I don't want you to see it.<br> I don't want anyone to see it.<br> You'll be so proud of me.<br> It'll be the best thing I've<br> ever done. The best thing anyone...<br> There she is!<br> Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?<br> Now, Papa, confess it.<br> - Could you want a prettier daughter?<br> - Stop it, Wolfie!<br> I look dreadful.<br> Are you...<br> ...expecting?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.<br> - May I offer you some tea?<br> - Who wants tea? Let's go out!<br> This calls for a feast.<br> You don't want tea, do you?<br> I know! Let's go dancing.<br> Papa loves parties, don't you?<br> How can you be so boring? Tea!<br> Come on, Papa. Hurry!<br> Here we go. Good day.<br> Now!<br> I name the penalty!<br> I name the penalty!<br> And the penalty is...<br> - Give her a good one!<br> - Show us your legs!<br> Come on, come on!<br> It's just a game, Papa.<br> Thank you.<br> "Herr Mozart", why don't you<br> name your son's penalty?!<br> Yes, Papa. Name it.<br> Name it. I'll do anything<br> you say. Anything.<br> I want you to come back<br> to Salzburg with me.<br> The penalty must be<br> performed in the room.<br> I'm tired of this game.<br> But my penalty!<br> I've got to have a penalty!<br> I name a penalty!<br> The penalty is...<br> ...you shall play our tune...<br> ...in the manner of<br> Johann Sebastian Bach!<br> - Turn him over!<br> - Over?!<br> Now you play it backwards!<br> - Another one! Give me another one!<br> - Play it like Gluck!<br> - Boring. Another!<br> - Handel!<br> I don't like him! Another one!<br> Play Salieri.<br> Now that is a challenge!<br> That is a challenge.<br> Please! Please!<br> Go on. Mock me. Laugh!<br> That was not Mozart laughing, Father.<br> That was God.<br> That was God laughing at me<br> through that obscene giggle.<br> Go on, "Signore". Laugh.<br> Show my mediocrity for all to see.<br> One day I will laugh at you.<br> Before I leave this earth...<br> ...I will laugh at you.<br> - Wolfie?<br> - What?<br> There's a young girl here to see you.<br> What does she want?<br> She won't talk to me.<br> She says she has to speak to you.<br> Damn.<br> Yes?<br> - Are you "Herr Mozart"?<br> - That's right.<br> My name is Lorl, sir.<br> I'm a maidservant.<br> I was asked to come here<br> and offer my services to you.<br> They'll be paid for by an admirer<br> of yours who wishes to remain...<br> ...anonymous.<br> Is this your idea, Papa?<br> Mine?<br> - Are you playing a trick on me?<br> - I've never seen this girl.<br> - Is this some kind of joke?<br> - Not at all, sir.<br> Young woman, this won't do.<br> My son can't accept such an offer,<br> no matter how generous...<br> ...unless he knows who's behind it.<br> - I can't tell you that, sir.<br> - This is ridiculous!<br> - What is ridiculous?<br> Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.<br> People send us gifts all the time.<br> You cannot accept her<br> without references.<br> Well, this is none of your business.<br> - Whoever sent you is going to pay?<br> - That's right.<br> Splendid! Now we're going<br> to let a stranger into our house.<br> Who is we? Who is letting who...?<br> - Could you please wait outside?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Look, old man!<br> We spend a fortune on you,<br> and all you can do is criticize.<br> - And now...<br> - Stanzi!<br> No! It's right that he should hear!<br> I'm sick to death of it.<br> We can't do anything<br> right for you, can we?<br> You won't have to do anything<br> for me ever again.<br> I'm leaving.<br> - No, Papa.<br> - I won't stay and be a burden.<br> No one calls you that.<br> She does. She says I sleep all day.<br> And so you do!<br> The only time you come out is to eat.<br> Well, what do you expect?<br> Do you expect anyone to walk out<br> into a mess like this every day?<br> - So now I'm a bad housekeeper!<br> - So you are. It's a pigsty.<br> When can you start?<br> - Right away, ma'am.<br> - Good.<br> They're out every night, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Do any pupils come to the house?<br> Not that I've seen.<br> Then how does he pay for all this?<br> Does he work at all?<br> Yes, sir. All day long. He never<br> leaves the house till evening.<br> He just sits there,<br> writing and writing.<br> Really?<br> What is it he's writing?<br> I wouldn't know that, sir.<br> Of course not.<br> You're a good girl.<br> You're very kind to do this.<br> The next time you're sure they'll<br> be out of the house, let me know.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I think I found out<br> about the money, sir.<br> Yes? What?<br> He kept seven snuffboxes in here.<br> I could swear they were all gold.<br> And now look.<br> There's only one left.<br> Where does he work?<br> In there, sir.<br> Gentlemen, I've just<br> heard some news...<br> ...that may interest you.<br> - What?<br> Mozart is writing a new opera.<br> An Italian opera.<br> Italian?<br> That's not all.<br> He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.<br> The Marriage of Figaro.<br> He's setting that play to music?<br> Yes.<br> What is this "Marriage of Figaro"?<br> It's a French play, Kapellmeister.<br> It has been banned by the emperor.<br> You're absolutely sure?<br> Herr Mozart.<br> Gentlemen, sit down.<br> Mozart.<br> Are you aware that I have declared<br> the French play "Figaro"...<br> ...unsuitable for our theater?<br> Yes, sire.<br> Yet we hear you're making an<br> opera from it. Is this true?<br> Who told you this, Majesty?<br> It is not your place to ask questions.<br> Is it true?<br> Yes, I...<br> I admit it is.<br> Would you tell me why?<br> Majesty, it is only a comedy.<br> What you think is scarcely the point.<br> It's what His Majesty thinks<br> that counts.<br> But, Your Majesty...<br> Mozart...<br> ...I am a tolerant man.<br> I do not censor things lightly.<br> When I do, I have good reason.<br> "Figaro" is a bad play.<br> It stirs up hatred between classes.<br> In France, it has caused<br> only bitterness.<br> My sister Antoinette is beginning<br> to be frightened of her own people.<br> I swear, there's nothing<br> like that in the piece.<br> I've taken out everything that could<br> give offense. I hate politics.<br> I'm afraid you're rather innocent.<br> In these dangerous times I cannot<br> afford to provoke our people...<br> ...simply over a theater piece.<br> Majesty, this is just a frolic.<br> A piece about love.<br> "Love". Again!<br> And it's new!<br> It's entirely new.<br> The people will go mad for it.<br> I have scenes...<br> The end of Act Il, for example.<br> It starts as a duet.<br> A husband and wife quarreling.<br> Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.<br> It's a very funny situation.<br> Duet turns into trio.<br> Then the husband's valet comes in.<br> Trio turns into quartet.<br> Then a gardener.<br> Quartet becomes quintet.<br> And so on, on and on.<br> Sextet, septet, octet.<br> How long do you think<br> I can sustain that?<br> I have no idea.<br> Guess.<br> Guess, Your Majesty.<br> Imagine the longest time<br> it could be sustained, then double it.<br> Well...<br> Six...<br> ...seven minutes?<br> - Eight minutes?<br> - Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!<br> Twenty minutes of continuous music.<br> No recitatives!<br> Sire, only opera can do this.<br> In a play, if more than one person<br> speaks at once...<br> ...it's just noise.<br> But with opera, with music...<br> ...you can have 20 individuals<br> all talking at the same time.<br> It's not noise.<br> It's a perfect harmony!<br> Mozart, music is not the issue here.<br> No one doubts your talent. It's your<br> literary judgment that's in question.<br> Even with the politics taken out,<br> it would still remain a vulgar farce.<br> Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?<br> Surely you can choose more<br> elevated themes.<br> Elevated!<br> What does that mean, elevated?<br> I am fed to the teeth with these...<br> ...elevated things. Old dead legends.<br> Why must we go on forever<br> writing of gods and legends?<br> Because they do.<br> They go on forever.<br> At least what they represent:<br> the eternal in us.<br> Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.<br> You and me,<br> just the same as His Majesty.<br> "Bello, bello, bello."<br> Come on now, be honest!<br> You'd rather listen to your hairdresser<br> than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.<br> People so lofty, they sound<br> as if they shit marble!<br> What!<br> Govern your tongue, Mozart!<br> How dare you!<br> Forgive me, Majesty.<br> I'm a vulgar man...<br> ...but I assure you, my music is not.<br> You are passionate, Mozart...<br> ...but you do not persuade.<br> Sire, the whole opera is finished.<br> Do you know how much work<br> went into it?<br> His Majesty has been<br> more than patient, "Signore".<br> How can I persuade if I can't show it?<br> That will do, "Herr Mozart".<br> Just let me tell you how it begins.<br> May I just do that, Majesty?<br> Show you how it begins? Just that?<br> Please.<br> Look...<br> There's a servant on his knees.<br> Do you know why?<br> Not from oppression.<br> He's measuring a space.<br> Do you know what for?<br> His bed. His wedding bed.<br> To see if it will fit!<br> Late.<br> Late!<br> On the beat.<br> Good!<br> Yes!<br> Early!<br> Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.<br> In that case, gentlemen, I think...<br> I think we should help<br> Mozart all we can.<br> And protect him against<br> the emperor's anger.<br> What anger?<br> About the ballet.<br> What ballet?<br> Excuse me...<br> ...but didn't His Majesty specifically<br> forbid the ballet in his opera?<br> - Herr Mozart!<br> - Yes?<br> - A word with you.<br> - Certainly, "Herr Direktor".<br> Now, "Herr Mozart"!<br> Five minutes, please.<br> Five minutes!<br> Yes?<br> Do you not know that His Majesty has<br> expressly forbidden ballet in operas?<br> - It's not a ballet, it's a dance.<br> - Exactly. A dance.<br> Surely, His Majesty didn't mean<br> no dancing when it's in the story.<br> It's dangerous to interpret his<br> edicts. Give me your score, please.<br> Thank you.<br> What are you doing, "Herr Direktor"?<br> Taking out what you should<br> never have put in.<br> Please. Please!<br> I have no one else to turn to.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's unbelievable.<br> The "direktor" has torn up<br> a huge section of my music.<br> They say I have to rewrite the opera.<br> But it's perfect as it is.<br> I can't...<br> ...rewrite what's perfect.<br> Please.<br> Can't you talk to him?<br> Please.<br> Why bother?<br> He's no friend of yours.<br> I could kill him!<br> I mean, really! Kill him!<br> I threw the entire score into<br> the fire, he made me so angry.<br> - You burned the score?<br> - No, my wife took it out in time.<br> Thank God.<br> It's unfair that a man like that<br> should have power over our work!<br> But there are those<br> who have power over him.<br> I think I'll take this up<br> with the emperor.<br> Excellency...<br> ...would you?<br> With all my heart, Mozart.<br> Thank you.<br> Please, "Herr Mozart".<br> "Please, it's not a holy relic."<br> I don't need to tell you I said<br> nothing, whatever, to the emperor.<br> I went to the theater to tell<br> Mozart something, anything...<br> ... when suddenly,<br> in the middle of the third act...<br> ... to my astonishment, the emperor...<br> ... who never attended rehearsals,<br> suddenly appeared.<br> What is this?<br> I don't understand.<br> Is it modern?<br> Majesty...<br> ...the "Herr Direktor"...<br> ...he has removed "un balletto"...<br> ...that would have occurred<br> at this place.<br> Why?<br> It is your regulation, sire.<br> No ballet in your opera.<br> Salieri.<br> Do you like this?<br> It's not a question<br> of liking, Majesty.<br> Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.<br> Well, look at them!<br> No! This is nonsense!<br> - Let me see the scene with the music.<br> - But, sire!<br> Oblige me!<br> Yes, Majesty.<br> Can we see the scene<br> with the music, please?<br> Certainly! Certainly, "Herr Direktor"!<br> Bring the palace set back in, please.<br> The restored third act...<br> ...was bold, brilliant.<br> The fourth...<br> ...was astounding.<br> I saw a woman...<br> ... disguised in her maid's clothes<br> hear her husband speak the first...<br> ... tender words he has<br> offered her in years.<br> Simply because he thinks<br> she is someone else.<br> I heard the music of true forgiveness<br> filling the theater...<br> ... conferring on all who sat there,<br> perfect absolution.<br> God was singing through<br> this little man...<br> ... to all the world.<br> Unstoppable.<br> Making my defeat more bitter<br> with every passing bar.<br> And then, do you know what happened?<br> A miracle!<br> With that yawn...<br> ... I saw my defeat<br> turn into a victory.<br> Mozart was lucky<br> the emperor yawned only once.<br> Three yawns...<br> ...and the opera<br> would fail the same night.<br> Two yawns, within a week at most.<br> With one yawn, the composer<br> could still get...<br> Nine performances! Nine!<br> That's all it's had! Withdrawn!<br> I know, I know.<br> It's outrageous.<br> Still, if the public<br> doesn't like one's work...<br> ...one has to accept<br> the fact gracefully.<br> But what is it that they don't like?<br> I can speak for the emperor.<br> You make too many demands<br> on the royal ear.<br> The poor man can't concentrate for<br> more than an hour. You gave him four.<br> What did you think of it yourself?<br> Did you like it at all?<br> I thought it was marvelous.<br> Of course.<br> It's the best opera yet written.<br> I know it!<br> Why didn't they come?<br> I think you overestimate<br> our dear Viennese, friend.<br> You didn't give them a bang<br> at the end of songs...<br> ...to let them know when to clap.<br> I know, I know.<br> Maybe you should give me<br> some lessons in that.<br> I wouldn't presume.<br> Nevertheless,<br> at the risk of imposing...<br> ...I'd like you to see my new piece.<br> It would be an honor for me.<br> No, the honor would be all mine.<br> I believe...<br> I believe...<br> ...it is the best opera<br> yet written, my friends.<br> Salieri!<br> You are the brightest star<br> in the musical firmament.<br> You do honor to Vienna and to me.<br> "Herr Mozart"!<br> - It was good of you to come.<br> - How could I not?<br> Bravo, maestro.<br> Did my work please you?<br> I never knew that music<br> like that was possible.<br> - You flatter me.<br> - No.<br> One hears such sounds...<br> ...and what can one say but: Salieri!<br> Everybody's here and we've got guests.<br> Bravo! Well, I've got some more.<br> You remember my good<br> friend Schikaneder. Come in.<br> Don't be shy.<br> - This is a very nice girl, and this...<br> - Wolfie?<br> Yes, my love?<br> - These gentlemen are from Salzburg.<br> - Salzburg?<br> We were just talking about Salzburg.<br> Your father is dead.<br> So rose the dreadful ghost...<br> ...from his next and blackest opera.<br> There on the stage,<br> stood the figure of a dead commander.<br> I knew...<br> ...only I understood...<br> ...that the horrifying apparition<br> was Leopold...<br> ...raised from the dead!<br> Wolfgang had actually<br> summoned up his own father...<br> ...to accuse his son<br> before all the world!<br> It was...<br> ...terrifying and wonderful to watch.<br> And now...<br> ...the madness began in me.<br> The madness of a man<br> splitting in half.<br> Through my influence, I saw to it...<br> ... "Don Giovanni" was played<br> only five times in Vienna.<br> But, in secret,<br> I went to every one of those five.<br> Worshiping sound<br> I alone seemed to hear.<br> And as I stood there,<br> understanding how...<br> ...that bitter old man was<br> still possessing his poor son...<br> ... even from beyond the grave...<br> ... I began to see a way...<br> ... a terrible way...<br> ...I could finally triumph...<br> ...over God.<br> "Herr Mozart"?<br> I have come to commission<br> work from you.<br> - What work?<br> - A Mass for the dead.<br> What dead?<br> Who is dead?<br> A man who deserved a Requiem Mass<br> and never got one.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I am only a messenger.<br> Do you accept?<br> You will be well paid.<br> Do you accept?<br> Work fast.<br> And be sure tell no one what you do.<br> You will see me again soon.<br> Wolfie?<br> My plan was so simple...<br> ...that it terrified me.<br> First, I must get the death Mass,<br> and then...<br> ...I must achieve his death.<br> What?<br> His funeral!<br> Imagine it!<br> The cathedral,<br> all Vienna sitting there.<br> His coffin.<br> Mozart's little coffin in the middle.<br> And then...<br> ...in that silence...<br> ...music.<br> A divine music...<br> ...bursts out over them all.<br> A great Mass of death.<br> Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.<br> Composed by his devoted friend...<br> ...Antonio Salieri.<br> What sublimity!<br> What depth!<br> What passion in the music!<br> Salieri has been touched<br> by God at last...<br> ...and God forced to listen!<br> Powerless to stop it!<br> I, for once, in the end,<br> laughing at him!<br> The only thing that worried me<br> was the actual killing.<br> How does one do that?<br> How does one kill a man?<br> It's one thing...<br> ...to dream about it.<br> Very different when you...<br> When you have to do it...<br> ...with your own hands.<br> Come in!<br> I've come to dinner<br> Dinner! Are you mad?<br> I'm a nobleman!<br> I only ever dine<br> with people of my own height!<br> Stop it!<br> Be careful<br> Be careful<br> Hold tight<br> I'm a famous...<br> ... horseman<br> And we're a famous horsy<br> Give me a hoof, my darling<br> And I'll give you my heart<br> Take me to your stable<br> And never more we'll part<br> Kill me<br> Kill me<br> We're going to make a soprano stew<br> We're going to make a soprano stew<br> And when you make a soprano stew<br> Shut up!<br> I'm sick to death of that tune!<br> Give me some hay, my darling<br> And I'll give you my heart<br> Leporello! Some hay!<br> We hope...<br> ... you're contented<br> With what...<br> ... we've presented<br> And love our dove of peace<br> - What did you think?<br> - It was wonderful!<br> - He liked the little people.<br> - It's all in good fun.<br> I liked the horse.<br> I tell you, if you played<br> "Don Giovanni" here...<br> ...you would've had<br> a wonderful success.<br> You belong here.<br> Not at the snobby court.<br> You could do anything you like.<br> The more fantastic, the better.<br> That's what people want: fantasy.<br> You write a proper part for me...<br> ...a couple of catchy songs...<br> ...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!<br> - What do you say?<br> - How much will you pay him?<br> Well! I see you brought<br> your manager with you.<br> Well, madame...<br> ...how about half the receipts?<br> Half the receipts!<br> - Stanzi!<br> - I'm talking about now.<br> How much will you pay him now?<br> Down payment.<br> Down payment?<br> Who do you think I am, the emperor?<br> I have to go.<br> Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.<br> You won't do this.<br> - Why not? Half the house!<br> - When?<br> We need money now! He pays<br> you now, or you don't do it.<br> I don't trust that man.<br> I don't like what he did<br> with your opera. It was common.<br> You liked it. Monkey, punky, flunky!<br> Half the house.<br> You'll never see a penny.<br> I want it here in my hand.<br> - I'll put it here in your hand.<br> - Shut up!<br> You won't put a thing in my hand<br> until I see some money!<br> It's embarrassing. Can't you think of<br> anyone who can do something for him?<br> I'm afraid Mozart<br> is a lost cause, baron.<br> He has succeeded in alienating<br> practically the whole of Vienna.<br> He never pays his debts.<br> I can't think of anyone<br> to whom I'd dare recommend him.<br> "Herr Mozart". What a surprise!<br> What can I do for you?<br> Is my pupil still interested<br> in learning the art of music?<br> Your pupil is married<br> and living in Mannheim, young man.<br> Really?<br> Perhaps your dear wife might care<br> to profit from my instruction.<br> What is it, Mozart?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Well...<br> ...since it appears no one<br> is eager to hire my services...<br> ...could you favor me<br> with a little money instead?<br> What for?<br> If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.<br> That's hardly the way to go about it.<br> You are right, sir. You are right.<br> But you see, I am endowed<br> with talent, and you with money.<br> If I offer mine...<br> ...you should offer yours.<br> I'm sorry, no.<br> Please.<br> My answer is no, Mozart.<br> Please.<br> Please!<br> Don't answer it.<br> Why?<br> Tell him...<br> Tell him I'm not here.<br> Tell him...<br> Tell him I'm working on it.<br> Come back later.<br> - Am I interrupting something?<br> - No.<br> Good. Where's our friend?<br> He's not here.<br> But he's working on it,<br> he told me to tell you.<br> Is that it?<br> Is he happy with it?<br> What's this? A Requiem Mass?<br> - You think I'm in the funeral business?<br> - Leave that alone!<br> - Put it down! It's nothing for you!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> What have you got for me?<br> Finished?<br> - What?<br> - The vaudeville, what do you think?<br> Yes.<br> - Can I see it?<br> - No.<br> Why not?<br> Because there's nothing to see.<br> Look...<br> ...I asked you if we could start<br> rehearsals next week and you said yes.<br> - Well, we can.<br> - So let me see it. Where is it?<br> Here.<br> It's all right here in my noodle.<br> The rest is just scribbling.<br> Scribbling and bibbling.<br> Bibbling and scribbling.<br> - Like a drink?<br> - Look, you little cunt!<br> Do you know how many<br> people I've hired?<br> - Leave him alone!<br> - I'm paying them!<br> - He's doing his best.<br> - Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!<br> You know what's ridiculous?<br> Your libretto!<br> Only an idiot would ask him<br> to work on that!<br> Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?<br> What's so intelligent about a Requiem?<br> Money. Money.<br> You're mad.<br> She's mad.<br> - Oh, yes?<br> - Wolfie, write it down.<br> Just write it down.<br> On paper.<br> It's no use to anybody in your head.<br> To hell with your death Mass!<br> Calm yourself.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> - I won't work there anymore.<br> - What happened?<br> You don't know what it's like.<br> "Herr Mozart" frightens me.<br> He drinks all day...<br> ...then takes all that medicine<br> and it makes him worse.<br> Is he working?<br> Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!<br> - When he speaks, he makes no sense.<br> - Is he working?<br> I suppose so.<br> He sits there all the time,<br> doing some silly opera.<br> - Opera?<br> - Don't ask me to go back again.<br> I'm frightened.<br> I'm very, very frightened!<br> Are you sure it's an opera?<br> I don't have it yet.<br> Are you neglecting my request?<br> No. No, I...<br> I promise you...<br> ...I'll give you a wonderful piece,<br> the best I ever...<br> This is my wife, Stanzi.<br> I've been sick,<br> but I'm all right now, aren't I?<br> Yes, sir. He's all right.<br> And he's working on it very hard.<br> Give me two more weeks. Please.<br> The sooner you finish,<br> the greater your reward.<br> Work.<br> Wolfie.<br> I think you really are going mad.<br> You slave for that idiot actor<br> who won't give you a penny!<br> And here,<br> this is not a ghost!<br> This is a real man,<br> who puts down real money.<br> Why on earth won't you finish it?<br> Can you give me one reason<br> I can understand?<br> It's killing me.<br> You're drunk, aren't you?<br> Be honest, tell me.<br> You've been drinking.<br> It's not fair.<br> I worry about you all the time.<br> I do everything I can to help you.<br> And all you do is drink<br> and talk nonsense, and frighten me.<br> Go back to bed!<br> Please.<br> Let me...<br> Let me sit here.<br> Let me stay here with you.<br> I did it.<br> And I was proud to do it.<br> "Leave!" I said. "Right away.<br> Take the child with you!"<br> "Go to the spa and get<br> your health back." I was shocked.<br> Shocked to my foundation<br> when I saw her.<br> I couldn't believe my eyes,<br> poor little thing.<br> You monster!<br> No one exists but you, do they?<br> You and your music. I warned her.<br> "Choose a man, not a baby", I said.<br> "You marry him, you won't have a pot<br> to piss in." You selfish thing!<br> Selfish, that's what you are.<br> Simply selfish! Do you hear me?<br> Pick him up.<br> Pick him up!<br> Be careful. Come with me.<br> You, follow me.<br> - Is it over?<br> - Yes, it's over. It's over.<br> Go!<br> Go, go. Go.<br> Go! Go!<br> Where is your wife?<br> Where is your wife?<br> She's not well either.<br> She went to the spa.<br> You are so good to me.<br> Truly. Thank you.<br> Please!<br> No, I mean to come to my opera.<br> You. You are the only colleague<br> of mine who came.<br> Mozart.<br> I would never miss anything<br> you had written.<br> - It's just a vaudeville.<br> - No, no!<br> It's a sublime piece.<br> The grandest "operone"!<br> I tell you...<br> ...you are the greatest composer<br> known to me.<br> Do you mean it?<br> - It's him!<br> - Who?<br> The man.<br> He's here.<br> Tell him to go away.<br> Tell him I'm still working on it.<br> Don't let him in.<br> No, no. Wait!<br> Ask him if he would<br> give me some money now.<br> Tell him if he would,<br> it will help me to finish it.<br> - Salieri?<br> - Yes.<br> - Can we come in?<br> - Better not. He's sleeping.<br> - He's all right, though?<br> - Yes, he's just exhausted.<br> He became dizzy, that's all.<br> - Well, tell him we came by, won't you?<br> - Of course.<br> Give him this. That's his share.<br> - That should cheer him up.<br> - Indeed!<br> And now, good night to you all.<br> It was...<br> ...perfection, truly.<br> Thank you.<br> What happened?<br> He said to give you this.<br> And if you finish by tomorrow night...<br> ...he will pay you<br> another hundred ducats.<br> Another...?<br> That's too soon. Tomorrow night...<br> It's impossible.<br> - Did he say a hundred?<br> - Yes.<br> It's too soon.<br> Can I...?<br> Could I help you?<br> Would you?<br> Actually, you could.<br> - I want to go.<br> - Where?<br> - I want to go back to Vienna.<br> - Now?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> I feel wrong.<br> I feel wrong being here.<br> - Where did I stop?<br> - The end of the "Recordare".<br> So now "Confutatis"...<br> How would you translate that?<br> "Consigned to flames of woe."<br> - Do you believe in it?<br> - What?<br> A fire which never dies,<br> burning you forever.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Possible.<br> - Come, let's begin.<br> - We ended in F major.<br> - Yes.<br> - So, now, A minor.<br> - A minor.<br> - Yes.<br> "Confutatis". A minor.<br> Start with the voices.<br> - Basses first. Second beat of the...<br> - Time?<br> Common time.<br> Second beat of the first measure.<br> On A.<br> Second measure, second beat.<br> You see?<br> - Yes. G-sharp?<br> - Of course.<br> Second beat<br> of the third measure, on E.<br> Do you have me? Show me.<br> Good. Good.<br> Now the tenors.<br> Fourth beat<br> of the first measure, on C.<br> Second measure, fourth beat. D.<br> - All right?<br> - Yes, continue.<br> Second beat<br> of the fourth measure, on F.<br> Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,<br> bass trombones, basses.<br> Identical notes and rhythm.<br> First bassoon, tenor trombones,<br> with the tenors.<br> - You go too fast.<br> - Do you have it?<br> - Bassoon to trombone what?<br> - With the tenors.<br> - Identical?<br> - The instruments doubling the voices.<br> Trumpets and timpani.<br> Trumpets in D. Listen.<br> - I don't understand!<br> - Listen!<br> Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant,<br> first and third beats.<br> It goes with the harmony!<br> Yes. Yes, yes!<br> I understand. And that's all?<br> No, now for the real fire.<br> Strings in unison.<br> Ostinato, on A. Like this:<br> Next measure is rising.<br> Do you have it? Show me.<br> - It's wonderful!<br> - Yes, yes. Go on.<br> - Write that down!<br> - Yes, yes.<br> "Call me among the blessed."<br> C major.<br> Sopranos and altos in thirds.<br> Altos on C, sopranos above.<br> Sopranos up to F on the second "voca"?<br> And on "dictus". And underneath,<br> just violins. Arpeggios.<br> Scale in eighth notes,<br> then back to ostinato.<br> - Do you have it?<br> - You go too fast.<br> - Do you have it?<br> - One moment, please!<br> Good. Show me the whole thing<br> from the beginning.<br> Do you want to rest a bit?<br> No, I'm not tired at all.<br> We'll stop for a moment.<br> - Then we'll finish the "Lacrimosa".<br> - I can keep going. I assure you.<br> Will you stay with me<br> while I sleep a little?<br> I'm not leaving you.<br> I'm so ashamed.<br> Of what?<br> I was foolish.<br> I thought you did not care<br> for my work, or me.<br> Forgive me.<br> Forgive me.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Your husband took sick.<br> I brought him home.<br> Why you?<br> Because, madame, I was at hand.<br> Well, thank you very much.<br> You can go now.<br> He needs me, ma'am.<br> No, he doesn't.<br> And I don't want you here.<br> Just go, please.<br> - He asked me to stay.<br> - And I'm ask...<br> I'm back.<br> I missed you so much.<br> If you'd just...<br> ...show me that you need me.<br> And I'll try to do better too.<br> What is this?<br> No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.<br> You're not to work on this ever again.<br> I've decided.<br> This is not his handwriting.<br> It's mine.<br> I was assisting him.<br> He's not to work on this anymore.<br> - It's making him ill.<br> - But...<br> Good night.<br> I regret we have no servants<br> to show you out, "Herr Salieri".<br> Please respect my wish and go.<br> Madame...<br> ...I will respect his.<br> Your merciful God.<br> He destroyed his own beloved,<br> rather than let a mediocrity...<br> ...share in the smallest part<br> of his glory.<br> He killed Mozart.<br> And kept me alive to torture.<br> Thirty-two years of torture.<br> Thirty-two years of slowly<br> watching myself become extinct.<br> My music...<br> ...growing fainter.<br> All the time fainter...<br> ...till no one plays it at all.<br> And his...<br> Good morning, professor.<br> Time for the water closet.<br> Then we have your favorite breakfast.<br> Sugar rolls.
