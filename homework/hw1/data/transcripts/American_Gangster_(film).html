Don't know what you're sayin.<br> - Pay your bills?<br> If you're not getting your share,<br> you should go talk to your chief.<br> What's my share?<br> Cause you don't fuckin know me.<br> - Maybe I am special.<br> - You are special.<br> Do you see that right there?<br> Special Investigations Unit.<br> Special.<br> Get it?<br> Ten grand, first of each month,<br> deliver right here.<br> - Are you done?<br> - Yeah, I'm done.<br> Don't forget your card.<br> Have a fuckin nice honeymoon.<br> Let's go.<br> His name is Frank Lucas,<br> originally from Greensboro,<br> North Carolina.<br> Couple of arrests years ago,<br> gambling and unlicensed firearm.<br> For fifteen years,<br> he was Bumpy Johnson's driver.<br> Bodyguard and collector.<br> He was with him when he died.<br> He's got five brothers.<br> He's the oldest.<br> And a lot of cousins.<br> They all live up here now,<br> spread throughout<br> the five boroughs in Jersey.<br> The brothers are Dexter,<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - In Brooklyn, a dry cleaner.<br> Picking up.<br> Melvin in Queens has a custom<br> furniture and fire door business.<br> - This one here?<br> - Right there.<br> Terrence in Newark<br> has a hardware store.<br> Turner in the Bronx has a tire shop.<br> And Huey Lucas in Bergen County<br> has a body shop.<br> Is there a manager here?<br> - That's my price.<br> - I'll take it somewhere else.<br> These businesses are the distribution<br> and collection points<br> for Frank's dope,<br> and Frank's money.<br> Everything about Frank's life<br> seems unpretentious,<br> orderly and legitimate.<br> Starts early, gets up at 5 am.<br> Has breakfast in a diner in Harlem<br> every morning<br> usually by himself.<br> Then starts work.<br> Takes a meeting with the accountant,<br> or his lawyer.<br> At night, he usually stays at home,<br> and if he does go out,<br> it's to one of two clubs, or a handful<br> of restaurants with his new wife.<br> Ball players, friends<br> musicians, never, never,<br> organized crime guys.<br> Sundays,<br> he takes his mother to church.<br> Then he drives out<br> and he changes the flowers<br> on Bumpy's grave.<br> Every Sunday no matter what.<br> Not your typical day in the life<br> of a dope man, Richie.<br> Bumpy's life wasn't typical either,<br> and he ran Harlem for years.<br> You're saying that Frank Lucas<br> replaced Bumpy Johnson?<br> - Yeah.<br> - His driver?<br> Sounds a little far-fetched.<br> But is it?<br> Because everything he does...<br> Handing out turkeys.<br> He does the same<br> as Bumpy would've done.<br> Who was Bumpy most likely to teach?<br> The guy he sees every day.<br> It's like a Sicilian family.<br> He structured his organization<br> to protect him in the same way.<br> And if he was with Bumpy for so long,<br> that means he would've spent<br> a lot of time with Italians,<br> definitively long enough<br> to learn that much.<br> But here's the thing.<br> I don't think it's Frank Lucas<br> we're after.<br> Who we want<br> is whoever Lucas is working for.<br> Whoever is bringing the heroin in.<br> Okay.<br> So, what do you have on him<br> that'll stick in court?<br> Because this isn't it.<br> Without powder,<br> without informants,<br> no one's going to jail.<br> That's understood, Sir,<br> I don't think we'll get<br> informants,<br> not from inside the family.<br> Unless we get very, very lucky.<br> That's it down there.<br> Let's all join hands.<br> Lord, we thank you for this food<br> we're about to receive<br> the nourishment of our bodies.<br> Fill our souls with heavenly grace,<br> in Jesus' name, and for his sake.<br> -
