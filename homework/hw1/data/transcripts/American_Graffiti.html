                        Hey, Curt, you guys gonna have<br> a little bash your last night in town?<br> Moose has been<br> lookin' for you all day.<br> He got worried. Thought you were<br> tryin' to avoid him.<br> What do you got?<br> - Oh, great.<br> - That's $2,000, man. $2,000!<br> Mr. Jennings gave it to me<br> to give to you. He's sorry it's late.<br> It's the first scholarship<br> the Moose Lodge has given out.<br> He says they're all very proud of you<br> back at the lodge.<br> - Why don't you hold it for me?<br> - I don't want it. Take it. It's yours.<br> I'll take it.<br> Listen, your sister calls.<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> - Wait a second. She can wait.<br> - Make it short and sweet, huh?<br> Listen, I don't think<br> I'm gonna be going tomorrow.<br> Come on.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I was thinkin' I could wait a year,<br> go to City for a while.<br> You chicken fink.<br> After all we went through<br> to get accepted?<br> We're gettin' out of<br> this turkey town...<br> and now you wanna crawl<br> back into your cell?<br> You wanna end up like John?<br> You just can't stay 17 forever.<br> - Get that through your head!<br> - I just need some time.<br> I gotta go talk to Laurie.<br> Now take it. Take it!<br> We're leaving in the morning,<br> all right?<br> We're leaving<br> in the morning!<br> We gonna rock and roll ourselves<br> to death, baby!<br> You got the Wolfman Jack Show!<br> Don't with the thing!<br> Will you stop it<br> with the Big Bopper stuff?<br> - Hi, John!<br> - Not too good, huh?<br> Why is it every girl around here<br> is ugly or has a boyfriend?<br> Where is the dazzling beauty<br> I've been searching for all my life?<br> I know what you mean.<br> The pickings are really gettin' slim.<br> The whole strip is shrinkin'.<br> You know, I remember<br> about five years ago...<br> it would take a couple of hours<br> and a tank full of gas...<br> just to make one circuit.<br> It was really somethin'.<br> Hey, John.<br> Someone new in town.<br> Are you gonna go after him?<br> Hey, listen, professor.<br> If he can't find me, then he ain't<br> even worth racin', right?<br> Big shot.<br> Well?<br> Where was I?<br> How you thought<br> high school romances were goofy...<br> and we started dating only because<br> you thought I was cute and funny...<br> but then you suddenly realized...<br> you were in love with me,<br> it was serious...<br> You were leadin' up<br> to somethin' kinda big.<br> You make it sound like<br> I'm giving dictation.<br> Well, seriously...<br> what I meant was that...<br> since we do care for each other<br> so much...<br> and since we should really consider<br> ourselves as adults now...<br> Could I have a couple<br> of those fries?<br> Where was I?<br> - Consider ourselves adults.<br> - Right, right.<br> I thought,<br> maybe before I leave...<br> we could agree that...<br> seeing other people while I'm away<br> can't possibly hurt, you know?<br> - You mean dating other people?<br> - It would strengthen our relationship.<br> Then we'd know for sure<br> that we're really in love.<br> Not that there's any doubt.<br> I think you're right.<br> I mean, we're not kids anymore...<br> and it's silly to think<br> that when we're 3,000 miles apart...<br> we shouldn't be able<br> to see other people and go out.<br> Laurie, listen.<br> I didn't ask for that back.<br> I know. I just sort of think<br> it's juvenile now.<br> I'll keep it at home.<br> It's less conspicuous there.<br> - You don't wanna wear it?<br> - I didn't say that.<br> I understand,<br> and I'm not upset.<br> I can't expect you to be a monk<br> while you're away.<br> I got a really neat<br> record collection.<br> I even got "Pledging My Love"<br> by Johnny Ace.<br> How can you love Nelson when<br> he's going out with Marilyn Gator?<br> - Since he dumped on you...<br> - He didn't dump on me, you little dip!<br> Oh, hi, Steve.<br> Hey, sis.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What is it?<br> - Nothing!<br> I've decided to let you take care<br> of my car while I'm away.<br> At least until Christmas.<br> I'm comin' back for a couple<br> of weeks at Christmas.<br> I've got some very simple instructions<br> for you. Here's the keys.<br> First of all,<br> only 30-weight Castrol-R.<br> I've written the tire pressure<br> and stuff on a pad in the glove...<br> - Are you listening?<br> - Hey, what's wrong?<br> - Are you crying?<br> - I can't believe it!<br> I don't know what to say!<br> I'll love and protect this car<br> until death do us part.<br> This is a super fine machine.<br> This might even be better than<br> Darryl Starbird's superfleck moon...<br> It is! It's better than<br> Darryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird.<br> Budda?<br> How'd you like to go<br> to the drive-in movies with me?<br> - You gotta be kidding.<br> - Would I kid about a thing like that?<br> I have a new car.<br> Did she do that to you?<br> Curt, you wanna bomb around?<br> I wanna try out my new wheels.<br> Well, I'd like to, Toad...<br> but I'm gonna go<br> with Steve and Laurie to the hop.<br> - Besides, I'd spoil your luck.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> Tonight, things are gonna be<br> different.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You're goin' to the freshman hop?<br> Come on, man!<br> That place is for kids.<br> You two just got your ass outta there.<br> Don't go back there.<br> You ain't got no emotions?<br> We are going to remember<br> all of the good times.<br> - Yeah, well, go.<br> - Why don't you come with us?<br> - Bullshit, man!<br> - Come on. For old times' sake.<br> Listen, you go.<br> Go ahead, Curtsie baby.<br> You go on over there and remember<br> the good times you won't be havin'.<br> I ain't goin' off to some<br> goddamn fancy college.<br> I'm stayin' right here...<br> havin' fun as usual!<br> Jesus, Milner, you're really<br> in a great mood tonight!<br> What's the matter, John?<br> Did I do somethin' wrong?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Man, it's nothin'.<br> - We'll see you later, okay?<br> - All right.<br> We'll all do somethin' together<br> before Steve leaves.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Now you're not goin'?<br> I don't know.<br> - Hey, Milner!<br> - What happened to your flathead?<br> - What happened to your flathead?<br> - Your mother!<br> Your mother!<br> Hey, we been talkin' 'bout you.<br> There's a very wicked<br> '55 Chevy lookin' for you.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> - Watch out for the cop at Jerry's.<br> Yeah, all right. Thanks.<br> Hey, Toad!<br> Is that you<br> in that beautiful car?<br> Jeez, what a waste<br> of machinery!<br> Hey, kid!<br> All right, baby.<br> Here we go with another call.<br> - Answer the phone, dummy.<br> - Pinkie's Pizza.<br> You got any more of those<br> secret agent spy scoops?<br> Hit parade<br> on a stethoscope?<br> No, secret agent spy scope, man...<br> that pulls in the moon,<br> stars, the planets...<br> and the satellites<br> and little bitty space men.<br> You have the wrong number,<br> partner.<br> Wait!<br> What did you say?<br> Quick. Quick.<br> Hang a right.<br> - What? Why?<br> - Steven, cut over to "G" Street.<br> I just saw a vision.<br> I saw a goddess.<br> Come on.<br> You gotta catch up to her.<br> - I didn't see anything.<br> - Come on, Curt.<br> We can't be spendin' half the night<br> chasing girls down for you.<br> Laurie, this was the most perfect,<br> dazzling creature I've ever seen!<br> - She's gone. Forget it.<br> - She spoke to me.<br> She spoke to me through the window!<br> I think she said, "I love you."<br> That means nothing<br> to you people?<br> You have no romance,<br> no soul?<br> Someone wants me. Someone<br> roaming the streets wants me.<br> Will you turn the corner?<br> - Later.<br> - Alligator.<br> You're new around here.<br> Where you from?<br> - Turlock.<br> - You know a guy named Frank Bartlett?<br> No. Does he go to Turlock High?<br> Well, he used to.<br> He goes to J.C. Now.<br> - Do you go to J.C.?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Wow! Do you know Guy Phillips?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> I got him in a class.<br> He's so boss!<br> How'd you like to ride around<br> with me for a while?<br> I'm sorry. I can't.<br> I'm going steady.<br> - Come on!<br> - I just can't.<br> You're just ridin' around<br> with a bunch of girls.<br> Anybody else in there<br> wanna go for a ride?<br> You got nothin' to fear.<br> I'm as harmless as a baby kitten.<br> - I'll go!

We'll go up<br> and stop at that light.<br> It'll turn red by the time we get there.<br> All right?<br> If you ever get tired of going steady<br> with somebody that ain't around...<br> I'm up for grabs.<br> So, you're Judy's little...<br> Shit! How old are you?<br> I'm old enough.<br> How old are you?<br> - I'm too old for you.<br> - You can't be that old.<br> I think you better go back<br> and sit with your sister.<br> Where are they anyway? Are they<br> comin' back? This is a joke, right?<br> This better be a joke,<br> 'cause I'm not drivin' you around!<br> You asked me. What's the matter?<br> Am I too ugly?<br> Judy doesn't want me with her,<br> and now you don't want me with you.<br> Nobody wants me.<br> Even my mother and father hate me.<br> - Everybody hates me.<br> - They don't hate ya.<br> - You throw me out, I'll scream.<br> - No, no. Stay cool.<br> Everything's all right.<br> We'll find your sister.<br> - Can't be too hard to find.<br> - John, you gonna be there tonight?<br> Shit!

Not the car!<br> Oh, no! Anything!<br> Not the car!<br> You know,<br> it doesn't make sense...<br> to leave home<br> to look for home.<br> To give up a life<br> to find a new life.<br> To say good-bye to friends you love<br> just to find new friends.<br> - Wait, could you say that again?<br> - Something Curt said.<br> Figures.<br> You must've talked his ear off<br> tryin' to get him to stay.<br> No, Steven. That's not true at all.<br> I didn't say anything.<br> Curt just said at dinner tonight...<br> that he didn't see<br> what the big hurry was.<br> He thought that he ought to stay<br> and go to J.C. For a while...<br> and try and figure out<br> what he wanted to do with his life.<br> - That sounds logical.<br> - Do you think so?<br> Sure. I think Curt's<br> probably right, for Curt.<br> Not for me, though.<br> Laurie, look at me.<br> You know what I want out of life.<br> And it's just not in this town.<br> I'm not going with you<br> to the airport tomorrow.<br> - No, Steven, don't.<br> - Come on.<br> It's our last night together<br> for three months.<br> I know. But we've been<br> through this before.<br> I'm gonna miss you so much.<br> I need something to remember you by.<br> You don't want me<br> to forget you, do you?<br> No.<br> What's wrong?<br> You're just sitting there.<br> - You want to. Go ahead.<br> - Not like that.<br> If you're not gonna remember me<br> for anything else, just go ahead.<br> Come on.<br> You want it and you know it.<br> Don't be so damn<br> self-righteous with me...<br> after all that stuff you told me<br> about watching your brother.<br> You're disgusting!<br> Get out of my car!<br> I told you never<br> to mention that!<br> So, anyhows, the goat killer...<br> - Can't we talk about something else?<br> - No.<br> Whenever he strikes, he leaves<br> a bloody goat's head next to the victim.<br> Isn't that creepy?<br> They thought he went up to Stockton,<br> but two nights ago...<br> they found the bodies<br> of Carlie Johnson and Don White...<br> right here at this canal<br> all hacked to pieces.<br> Who do you think'll take<br> the regionals this year?<br> Not only were there bloody<br> goats' heads all around...<br> but he had switched parts<br> of their bodies.<br> She had on his arms<br> and he had on her legs and...<br> Wait a second!<br> Did you hear that?<br> - Do you think it's the goat killer?<br> - No!<br> Listen, I'll go for help<br> and you stay here.<br> No, let's get in this field.<br> Come on, come on!<br> Maybe if it's the goat killer, he'll get<br> somebody and we'll see the whole thing.<br> I don't want to see<br> the whole thing!<br> I can't see what he's doing.<br> Darn it,<br> I wish I could see.<br> I can't see anything.<br> I don't wanna see anything.<br> Just keep him away from me.<br> That's all I want.<br> How do I get into these things?<br> We're all right up...<br> Debbie?<br> - Oh, no! Please! Please!<br> - Terry.<br> - Steve!<br> - What are you doin' up here?<br> Oh, God, Steve.<br> Is it safe to come out?<br> - Where did you go, anyway?<br> - Over there.<br> - Let's get outta here.<br> - Where's my 'rod?<br> - Your 'rod?<br> - Yeah.<br> Did I introduce you?<br> This is Debbie. Debbie, this is Steve.<br> Well?<br> It's in the garage.<br> I put it in the garage<br> for safekeeping.<br> I don't want to take any chances<br> with it.<br> It's a good thing too,<br> because somebody stole our car.<br> - That's terrible. What kind was it?<br> - Where's Laurie anyway?<br> - I guess we broke up.<br> - You broke up? Bull.<br> Doesn't look like a gearshift knob.<br> What is it?<br> - Come on, give it back to me.<br> - What's wrong? You're a tough guy.<br> Go ahead and cream me.<br> Break my arm. See if I care.<br> I was just gonna keep it<br> for a little while.<br> You're an ogre, like my father.<br> He won't let me stay out late,<br> or play records, or anything.<br> Your father won't let you<br> stay out late?<br> No, he's terrible.<br> Once I was out late at a party.<br> He called the cops.<br> Can you imagine?<br> He had the whole police force there.<br> By the way,<br> where is it that you live, Carol?<br> Over on Ramona. Why?<br> Oh, no! You thought I'd tell you<br> where I live?<br> Not me. Not old Carol.<br> The night is young.<br> And I'm not hittin' the rack<br> till I get a little action.<br> What do you keep lookin' at?<br> Who's that? You know him?<br> - He's followin' awful close.<br> - Grab on to something.<br> Hey, man, I'm sorry<br> if I scared ya.<br> You'd have to do a hell of a lot<br> more than that to scare me.<br> I been lookin' all over for ya.<br> Didn't nobody tell you?<br> I can't keep track of all you punks<br> runnin' around here backwards.<br> You're supposed to be<br> the fastest thing in the valley.<br> But that can't be your car.<br> It must be your mama's car.<br> I'm sort of embarrassed<br> to be this close to you.<br> I'm not surprised,<br> drivin' a field car.<br> Field car?<br> What's a field car?<br> A field car runs through the fields,<br> drops cow shit all over the place.<br> That's pretty good.<br> I like the color of your car, man.<br> What's that supposed to be?<br> A cross between piss yellow<br> and puke green, ain't it?<br> You call that a paint job,<br> but it's pretty ugly.<br> I'll bet you gotta sneak up on the pumps<br> just to get a little air in your tires.<br> At least I don't have to pull over<br> to the side just to let a funeral go by.<br> Funny. You know what?<br> Your car's uglier than I am!<br> That didn't come out right.<br> Come on, boy.<br> Let's go. Prove it.<br> Why don't you go out and try<br> to win yourself a few races?<br> Then you come on back<br> and I'll show you a few things.<br> Race him. You can beat him.<br> That's a tough-lookin' girl<br> you got with you, man.<br> Tryin' to pick up<br> a few extra bucks baby-sittin'?<br> Doll, come and ride with me...<br> in about ten years!<br> Leave her out of this.<br> This is between you and me.<br> He's really fast, isn't he?<br> Yeah, but he's stupid.<br> Any of you guys know a blonde<br> in a white T-Bird?<br> I know her.<br> What about it?<br> I'm tryin' to find out who she is.<br> She's out of your price range, man.<br> - My brother's been out with her.<br> - Price range?<br> Are you trying to tell me<br> she's a prost...<br> That's right, she's a $30 Sheri.<br> Can you imagine that?<br> - Thirty bucks for that broad.<br> - We're thinkin' about different broads.<br> Watch it. Fuzz ahead.<br> - Where?<br> - At Jerry's Cherry.<br> You can barely see the fender.<br> Yeah. We oughta do somethin'.<br> I got an idea.<br> I got a good idea.<br> I think I'm gonna<br> go over to Burger City.<br> Yeah, Laurie's probably over there.<br> You think she's got me<br> worried about where she is, don't you?<br> I couldn't care less.<br> - Want to come along?<br> - Yeah, I do.<br> - No.<br> - Make up your minds.<br> No, thanks.<br> We got to report the car missing.<br> All right. I'll see ya.<br> Shut up! They'll hear us.<br> - Listen, Carl...<br> - Curt.<br> Despite you scratchin' Gil's car,<br> I like you.<br> And I know what you'd like<br> more than anything right now.<br> Like every guy in this town, you got<br> the same secret dream, right?<br> You wanna be a Pharaoh.<br> Go ahead. You can admit it.<br> But you didn't think<br> it was possible, did you?<br> Well, tonight...<br> I'm gonna give you your chance.<br> Get down.<br> Okay. Now, you got it?<br> - I'm stayin' here. You're on your own.<br> - Wait a minute, Joe.<br> - What if he hears me?<br> - Listen, listen!<br> Look at it this way.<br> You got three choices.<br> One, you chicken out.<br> In that case, I let Ants tie you<br> to the car and drag you around a bit.<br> - You don't want that, right?<br> - No.<br> Two, you foul up<br> and Holstein hears you, and, well...<br> - You don't want that, right?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Three, you are successful<br> and you join the Pharaohs...<br> with a car coat and<br> a blood initiation and all that.<br> Wait a minute.<br> What blood initiation?<br> Why don't we go get your Jeep?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Your Jeep.<br> The one you sold the hunting ponies for.<br> The one with the four-wheel drive.<br> You sure you got<br> enough slack?<br> Yeah, no sweat.<br> Let's get outta here.<br> Come on, Terry.<br> Stand by for justice!<br> I can't believe it.<br> Feeling so good<br> 'cause you're 16.<br> Ooh, you come on<br> like a dream<br> Peaches and cream<br> Lips like strawberry wine<br> You're 16<br> You're beautiful<br> and you're mine<br> Why are we stopping here?<br> - Carol.<br> - What?<br> I don't think that I can<br> control myself any longer.<br> - You can't?<br> - I've got to have you.<br> Me?<br> All night you've been sitting there<br> and you've been so sexy...<br> and it's been so hot out here...<br> and I can't wait any longer.<br> A lot of that<br> was an act, you know.<br> Like my crying.<br> That was just an act.<br> It's been building up inside of me<br> like a volcano all night.<br> If you told me where you lived,<br> then I could take you home...<br> but you won't tell me where you live,<br> so here we are.<br> I mean, I've got to have you.<br> It's too late.<br> It's not too late.<br> It's never too late!<br> I'll show you.<br> It's easy to find.<br> Hi, Steve.<br> Mind if I sit down?<br> No. Have a seat.<br> Just got five minutes off<br> and I saw you all alone...<br> for once.<br> - Where's Laurie?<br> - I don't know.<br> I thought you guys'd be together,<br> this being your last night.<br> - We broke up.<br> - What?<br> - It's no big deal.<br> - What happened?<br> Budda, you got an hour left.<br> Let's get on it.<br> All right, all right,<br> you old fart! Relax!<br> Listen.<br> I'm off in an hour, and I thought<br> you'd maybe like to come over.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Well, why not?<br> This time it'd just be for fun.<br> Okay?<br> Okay.<br> I'll see you later, then.<br> Budda, wait.<br> Listen, l...<br> I gotta get up early in the morning<br> and I don't think it'd work out.<br> I tell you somethin'.<br> That thing jumped about<br> five feet in the air...<br> Listen, I still gotta find<br> that blonde.<br> Anyway, we'll catch you tomorrow.<br> I guess so. I don't know.<br> What do you mean,<br> you guess so?<br> We don't admit a lot of guys<br> to the Pharaohs.<br> We got to steal your car coat,<br> things like that.<br> You gotta<br> make up your mind.<br> Rome wasn't burned<br> in a night.<br> - Let's go!<br> - I'll see you, boys.<br> You only got about five minutes<br> if you want to talk to the Wolfman.<br> Gonna make all your dreams<br> come true, baby.
