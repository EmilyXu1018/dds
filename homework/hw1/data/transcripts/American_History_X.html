Have a look-see.<br> Cameron Alexander, well,<br> he's a Venice Beach landmark.<br> He's the biggest distributor<br> and writer...<br> of White Power literature<br> and videos in L.A. County.<br> He promotes White Power bands,<br> he writes reviews...<br> and in his spare time, this guy<br> even writes hate columns.<br> - Does he have a record?<br> - He's pretty clean.<br> Been trying to pin something<br> to him, but it doesn'twork.<br> Trust me.<br> He's behind all of it.<br> He runs everything<br> out of his house by the beach.<br> There were no white gangs<br> in Venice Beach...<br> before Cameron Alexander<br> and Derek Vinyard hooked up.<br> Alexanderfound in Derek<br> his shining prince.<br> Essentially,<br> he used Derek to recruit...<br> a slew of insecure, frustrated,<br> and impressionable kids.<br> This kid Vinyard,<br> he's got a lot of baggage...<br> as you'll see on this tape<br> we've gotten courtesy of NBC.<br> Earliertoday, L.A. County<br> fire-fighter Dennis Vinyard...<br> was shot and killed<br> battling a blaze...<br> at a suspected Compton drug den.<br> We're at the Vinyard home now...<br> and Lieutenant Vinyard's<br> oldest son Derek...<br> has agreed to talk with us<br> for a moment.<br> Derek, if you could come<br> down here please for a second.<br> Look, I know this is tough,<br> but how do youfeel right now?<br> How do you think lfeel?<br> - I think it's typical.<br> - Typical how?<br> Well, this country's becoming<br> a haven for criminals...<br> so what do you expect?<br> Decent hard-working Americans<br> like my dad...<br> are getting rubbed out<br> by social parasites.<br> Parasites?<br> Blacks, browns, yellow,<br> whatever.<br> I don't understand.<br> You think maybe yourfather's<br> murderwas race-related?<br> Yeah, it's race-related.<br> Every problem in this country<br> is race-related.<br> Not just crime.<br> It's immigration,AIDS, welfare.<br> Those are problems<br> of the black community...<br> the Hispanic community,<br> the Asian community.<br> They're notwhite problems.<br> Aren't those really issues<br> that deal more with poverty?<br> No. They're not products<br> of their environments.<br> Minorities don't give two shits<br> about this country.<br> They come here to exploit it,<br> not to embrace it.<br> Millions of white Europeans<br> came here andflourished...<br> within a generation.<br> What the fuck is the matter<br> with these people?<br> They have to go around<br> shooting atfiremen.<br> What does this have to do<br> with the murder of yourfather?<br> Because my fatherwas murdered<br> doing his job!<br> Putting out afire in afucking<br> nigger neighbourhood...<br> he shouldn't<br> have given a shit about.<br> He got shot<br> by afucking drug dealer...<br> who probably still collects<br> a welfare cheque.<br> Derek Vinyard was quietly<br> releasedfrom Chino...<br> early this morning after serving<br> three and some odd years.<br> I think this is something<br> we gotta keep an eye on.<br> If something happens to him...<br> things could get very ugly<br> down by the beach.<br> Just keep it low.<br> Venice Beach<br> didn't always look like this.<br> It used to be<br> a great neighbourhood.<br> The boardwalk's always<br> been a dump...<br> butwhen my dad moved us<br> out here...<br> Venice was a nice,<br> quiet place to grow up.<br> Overthe years, though,<br> it's just gone to hell.<br> The gangs are like a plague.<br> They moved westfrom Inglewood<br> and South Central...<br> and basically took over.<br> I ain'tfoulin' you!<br> I ain't got time<br> for all this bullshit.<br> Fuck y'all.<br> You all right?<br> I'm all right.<br> Yo, is that thatfool<br> you was telling me about?<br> Yeah, that's that motherfucker.<br> Yeah, man, that's him.<br> Bitch-ass motherfucker.<br> That's why Derek started<br> the D.O.C.<br> He said white kids shouldn't<br> have to walk around scared...<br> in their own neighbourhood,<br> andfor a while there...<br> we really made it<br> like itwas ours again.<br> Throw the ball!<br> Come on, Curtis!<br> Quit chucking it up.<br> Pass the ball.<br> "D" up!<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Look at this<br> fucking jungle bunny.<br> He does a spin move every time.<br> You ain't gettin' shit,<br> motherfucker.<br> This one's for you, boy!<br> What the fuck you...<br> Who you callin' boy,<br> motherfucker?<br> You're lucky, motherfucker!<br> I'm through monkeying around<br> with yourfucking ass!<br> Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating,<br> cracker motherfucker.<br> A hundred bucks<br> say I make you my bitch.<br> Hearthat?<br> He's trying to make ends meet...<br> for his cut in welfare.<br> You're on!<br> It's eight-six, Seth.<br> When I want your opinion,<br> I'll ask for it.<br> Come on.

Now!<br> All right, let's go!<br> Come on!<br> Come on, let's go.<br> No green card, no fucking work.<br> Comprende?<br> Come on!<br> We're fucking going! Come on!<br> Dad was gone, but things<br> were almost normal again.<br> Derek had a good job.<br> Mom was starting<br> to live a little.<br> Everyone was feeling so good,<br> we just didn't see it coming.<br> Maybe we should've.<br> The irony is<br> that most of the stores...<br> destroyed during the riots<br> were owned by black people.<br> That's stupid, though.<br> Why trash your neighbourhood?<br> Well, that's my point.<br> It's an irrational act.<br> It's like an expression<br> of rage...<br> by people who feel neglected<br> and turned away by the system.<br> It's like we had in Watts<br> orthe riots in Chicago in '68.<br> I don't buy that.<br> Calling a riot an irrational<br> expression of rage.<br> That's such a cop-out.<br> It's opportunism at its worst.<br> It's people grabbing<br> any excuse they can find...<br> to go and loot a store,<br> nothing more.<br> The fact that these people<br> ripped off the stores...<br> in their own communities,<br> all that reflects...<br> is that they have no respect<br> forthe law at all...<br> and certainly no concept<br> of community...<br> or civic responsibility.<br> Now wait a minute.<br> White people commit crimes<br> againstwhite people, too.<br> Yeah, but they're not offing<br> each other in record numbers.<br> Look at the statistics,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> One in every three<br> black males...<br> is in some phase<br> of the correctional system.<br> Is that a coincidence...<br> or do these people have<br> a racial commitment to crime?<br> Not only that.<br> They're proud of it.<br> Maybe it says something<br> about prejudice...<br> in the judicial system.<br> If you want to talk<br> about criminal statistics...<br> take a look at the social<br> inequalities that produce them.<br> That's exactly what I hate.<br> You're taking one thing<br> and calling it something else...<br> and just alleviating<br> the responsibility...<br> these people have<br> fortheir own actions.<br> It's like saying,<br> it's not a riot, it's rage.<br> It's not crime, it's poverty.<br> That's just nonsense.<br> It's exactly what happened<br> in this trial...<br> because the media<br> twisted things around...<br> so people got allfocused<br> on these cops...<br> and whether or not they were<br> going to get convicted...<br> and whether Rodney King's<br> civil rights had been violated.<br> Everybody lost sight<br> of old Rodney King himself.<br> The guy's a multiple felon<br> by his own admission.<br> He's high as a goddamn kite...<br> driving 120 miles an hour<br> down the highway.<br> He gets pulled over<br> by a bunch of cops...<br> and he attacks them.<br> He attacked police officers.<br> That's the bottom line,<br> and he walked.<br> And there's some yahoo there<br> with a video camera...<br> who turned it on<br> halfway through...<br> so that all we see<br> is them hitting him.<br> You got Powell and Koon<br> cracking him with billy clubs...<br> and Briseno's kicking him<br> in the back of the skull...<br> so it looks severe, you know?<br> People are going,<br> "Oh, this poor guy."<br> This poor guy<br> who attackedfour cops...<br> and those cops<br> end up on the stand...<br> defending themselves for using<br> standard textbook procedures.<br> I don't think the tapes<br> showed that at all.<br> You didn't think so?<br> And you're an authority?<br> Murray, what do you think?<br> I did think the police used<br> their clubs rather excessively.<br> Who are you<br> to say what's excessive?<br> I think itwas<br> totally appropriate.<br> They're in a better position<br> to make that call than you are.<br> We, as society, grant cops<br> a certain amount of authority...<br> to make those calls,<br> because we acknowledge...<br> that their job is difficult<br> and dangerous.<br> Very few people respect that<br> and respect that authority.<br> Look who's talking about<br> respect... Mr. Junior KKK.<br> What?<br> You want to go to college?<br> Learn to listen.<br> I didn't say I respect the laws.<br> I acknowledge a cop's authority.<br> I don't respect laws that let<br> Rodney King back on the street.<br> Second, I am not a member<br> of a low-rent...<br> disorganized bunch of rednecks<br> like the fucking KKK. Please.<br> So take your head<br> out of your ass.<br> You've gotten off the point.<br> I had a point.<br> Thatwasn't even the point.<br> Do you have one?<br> What is your point?<br> All right, think about this.<br> If Danny was walking<br> across the street that night...<br> and Rodney King<br> plowed into him...<br> Can we drop<br> this Rodney King thing?<br> Who would like some dessert?<br> We're having a discussion.<br> We're having<br> a nice discussion, right?<br> If Rodney King<br> had been driving along...<br> hopped up on PCP<br> and had killed Danny...<br> you'd be singing<br> a different tune...<br> I didn't see him hit anybody,<br> and neither did you.<br> He didn't happen<br> to kill anybody, thank God.<br> Keep it down, OK?<br> Ally's sleeping.<br> If thatfucking monkey<br> had run some kid over...<br> everybody would have<br> a very different opinion.<br> They'd be focused on Rodney King<br> and not on these officers.<br> But instead,<br> he just attacked afew cops...<br> so, suddenly,<br> it's Hands Across America...<br> forthis fucking total<br> son of a bitch.<br> It blows my mind.<br> We're so hung up on this notion<br> thatwe have some obligation...<br> to help<br> this struggling black man.<br> Cut him some slack<br> until he can overcome...<br> these historical injustices.<br> It's crap. This stuff<br> just perpetuates it...<br> all this liberal nonsense.<br> Everyone's looking<br> the otherway...<br> while our country rots<br> from the inside out.<br> I mean, Christ, Lincoln freed<br> the slaves 130 years ago.<br> How long does it take<br> to get your act together?<br> Jews have been persecuted<br> for over 5,000 years.<br> Are you saying it's wrong<br> to feel sensitive...<br> about anti-Semitism?<br> Oh, forget that.<br> I'm with you. I'm with you<br> all the way, baby.<br> I'm so sick of<br> these liberal hypocrites.<br> Here we go again.<br> I love this part.<br> This is great.<br> Look how they scapegoated<br> Chief Gates.<br> Think they would've come down<br> that hard on Willie Williams?<br> No way. That videotape was<br> a set-up to get rid of Gates.<br> - Can I be excused?<br> - No. Don't interrupt.<br> Excuse me. I was talking.<br> I listened to you.<br> - Who do you think you are?<br> - She's making a point.<br> Davina, sit down.<br> Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!<br> - Derek, calm down.<br> - Don't tell him to shut up!<br> Sit your ass down. No.<br> Sit down. Shut your mouth.<br> Move! Goddamn it! Move!<br> Shut your mouth and give<br> my girlfriend respect.<br> Derek, what are you<br> trying to prove?<br> Murray, stay out of it!<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> Derek, let her go!<br> You need to learn<br> some fucking manners, Davina!<br> Shut yourfucking mouth!<br> Stop!<br> She can't breathe!<br> Let her go!<br> You going to apologize?<br> You're afucking asshole.<br> I hate you!<br> What are you doing?<br> This is yourfamily.<br> Right.<br> My family, so you know what?<br> I don't give two shits about you<br> orwhat you think.<br> You're not a part of it.<br> - That has nothing to do with it.<br> - It doesn't?<br> You don't think<br> I see what you're doing?<br> You think<br> I'll sit here and smile...<br> while some fucking kike<br> tries to fuck my mother?<br> It's never going to happen.<br> Fuckingforget it.<br> Notwhile I'm in this family.<br> I willfucking cut<br> your Shylock nose off...<br> and stick it up your ass<br> before I let that happen.<br> Coming in here and poisoning<br> my family's dinner...<br> with yourJewish,<br> nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.<br> Fuck you.
