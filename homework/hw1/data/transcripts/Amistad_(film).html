                        Por favor!<br> Si.<br> Dolly!<br> Dolly!<br> Lay up, Mr. Packwood!<br> Aye, aye, sir!<br> Straight ahead!<br> Fire over their heads!<br> Open the gate!<br> Come on, come on, come on!<br> Move along, now!<br> Move along!<br> - Forward! Move along!<br> - Keep it going!<br> Get along! Get moving!<br> - Don't stop there! Keep moving!<br> - Make way for the stinking heathens!<br> All right, move on.<br> Lock 'em up!<br> Gates! Gates! Gates!<br> Push 'em in!<br> Mr. President!<br> What?<br> Seor Calderon.<br> Yes, all right. Not now.<br> - It is a matter of importance, sir.<br> - God bless you all!<br> I'm trying to drink my brandy<br> after a very long day.<br> I simply wasn't certain<br> whether this was something you wanted<br> to take care of personally.<br> Leder, there are what, four million<br> Negroes in this country?<br> Why on earth should I concern<br> myself with these forty-four? Hmm?<br> Well, there are reasons.<br> I don't care how.<br> You just take care of it.<br> The ship is Amistad.<br> It's too small to be<br> a transatlantic slaver.<br> They're plantation slaves, then?<br> West Indians?<br> Not necessarily.<br> At least they certainly<br> don't look it.<br> Not from the glimpse I caught of them<br> on their way to jail.<br> They have these... scars.<br> - Scars?<br> - Yeah.<br> They were first detained by officers<br> of a brig off Long Island.<br> They were conveyed to New Haven -<br> under what authority, I don't know -<br> and given over to<br> the local constabulary.<br> About forty of them,<br> including four or five children.<br> The arraignment<br> is day after tomorrow.<br> I can only assume that<br> the charge is murder.<br> I'll see what I can do about that.<br> Perhaps a writ for illegal arrest<br> and detainment to stall things.<br> At the very least,<br> make sure they have good counsel.<br> Hear ye! In the matter of the court<br> of the United States of America<br> in the year of our Lord, 1839, the<br> honourable Andrew T Judson presiding.<br> If it please, Your Honour.<br> The bench recognises<br> District Attorney Holabird.<br> I would like to present<br> the court, Your Honour,<br> with the charges<br> of piracy and murder...<br> I have a petition for<br> a writ of habeas corpus.<br> I was speaking.<br> Mr. Holabird, your charges, whatever<br> they might be, will be rendered moot.<br> That petition, Mr. Tappan<br> - if that's what it is - is moot,<br> until an actual writ by some higher<br> court, by some miracle, is granted.<br> - Mr. Holabird is correct.<br> - And if you would, sir,<br> please kindly refrain from<br> impersonating a lawyer,<br> which you patently are not.<br> - As I was saying, Your Honour...<br> - Your Honour.<br> Mr. Secretary.<br> Your Honour, I am here on behalf of<br> the President of the United States,<br> representing the claims of<br> Queen Isabella of Spain,<br> as concerns our mutual treaty<br> on the high seas of 1795.<br> - You have my attention.<br> - Thank you.<br> These slaves, Your Honour,<br> are the property of Spain,<br> and as such, under Article 9 of said<br> treaty, are to be returned posthaste.<br> Said treaty taking precedence<br> over all other claims...<br> Them slaves belong to me<br> and my mate, Your Majesty.<br> - Your Honour, I...<br> - Who be you two gentlemen?<br> "We, Thomas R Gedney<br> and Richard W Meade,<br> "whilst commissioned<br> US Naval officers,<br> "stand before this court<br> as private citizens,<br> "and do hereby claim salvage<br> on the high seas<br> "of the Spanish ship La Amistad<br> and all her cargo."<br> - Here you go, sir.<br> - Your Honour...<br> You wish to make this claim above<br> that of the Queen of Spain?<br> Where was she, pray,<br> when we was fightin' the winds,<br> Your Excellen... uh, Honour.<br> Her Majesty, the Queen of Spain,<br> was busy ruling a country.<br> Your Honour, these officers<br> claims are just...<br> Your Honour!<br> Here are the true owners<br> of these slaves.<br> - Order!<br> - On their behalf...<br> I am in possession of<br> a receipt for purchase<br> executed in Havana, Cuba,<br> June 26, 1839,<br> I do hereby call upon this court<br> to immediately surrender...<br> - ..these goods!<br> And that ship out there<br> to my clients,<br> - Jose Ruiz...<br> - Yo soy Ruiz.<br> "Yoso" Ruiz, and... Pedro Montes?<br> Pedro Montes.<br> Ah, Mr. Tappan. How do you do, sir?<br> My name is Roger S Baldwin,<br> attorney-at-law.<br> Real estate?<br> Real estate, inventories<br> and other assets.<br> - Can I help you with something?<br> - What is it that you do?<br> Well, I own various business...<br> and banks.<br> As a matter of fact, you probably<br> could help me, Mr. Tappan.<br> But that's not why I'm here.<br> I'd like to help you.<br> - Me?<br> - Yes. I deal with property.<br> Sometimes I get people's<br> property back,<br> other times I get it taken away,<br> as in this case.<br> Every one of the claims speaks<br> to the issue of ownership.<br> - Thank you, Mr... Mr. Baldwin.<br> - Baldwin, Roger S, attorney-at-law.<br> But I'm afraid what's<br> needed here is a criminal attorney.<br> A trial lawyer.<br> But thanks for your interest.<br> Yes. Well...<br> intending no disrespect, Mr. Tappan,<br> but if that were the way to go,<br> well, then...<br> Well, I wouldn't have bothered<br> coming down here.<br> Goodbye. I bid you gentlemen<br> a good afternoon.<br> In closing,...<br> I call upon our distinguished<br> colleague from Massachusetts,<br> Representative John Quincy Adams<br> to reweigh his unmeet<br> and unprecedented attempt<br> to convert this eccentric<br> bequest of - let's be frank -<br> a bunch of junk of<br> one James Smithson,<br> into a so-called institute<br> of national treasure!<br> Perhaps Mr. Adams is meditating<br> on his response.<br> Had I thought your remarks worthy<br> of riposte, Representative Pinckney,<br> be assured you'd have heard<br> from me... hours ago!<br> - Who?<br> - Mr. Tappan. Lewis Tappan.<br> Yeah?<br> I must see him?<br> I'm required to see him?<br> No, sir. He requests an audience.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Oh, he requests, does he?<br> Yeah. I don't know<br> anyone called Tappan.<br> - Sir, you do. You've met him often.<br> - Where?<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's right over there, sir.<br> Oh.<br> - What is that?<br> - Where?<br> - Right there, sir.<br> Lewis! Good to see you again!<br> - And you, sir.<br> - This is Theodore Joadson.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> - An honour to meet you, sir.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Sir? Is there somewhere...<br> - Let's stroll in the garden...<br> - Yes.<br> - What?<br> Let go of my arm. Over here.<br> This case has<br> great significance.<br> Our secretary of state<br> is paying it his attention.<br> You don't have to shout!<br> He supports the Queen's<br> claim that she owns the Africans.<br> - Two sailors are making claims.<br> - What season is it?<br> - Pardon?<br> - I said, what season is it?<br> I don't understand what you mean.<br> There are two ways of knowing<br> without consulting a calendar.<br> The leaves on the maple trees<br> have all gone,<br> and the fact that the President is<br> not at home on Pennsylvania Avenue.<br> Tell me, sir...<br> Do you really think Van Buren<br> cares about the whims<br> of an 11-year-old girl<br> who wears a tiara?<br> I assure you, only one thing occupies<br> his thoughts this time of the year,<br> being all things to all people,<br> which means nothing to no one.<br> In other words,<br> gettin' himself re-elected.<br> Give me a hand.<br> Huh?<br> - Will you help us, sir?<br> - Let go of my arm.<br> Take my stick.<br> - Mr. Adams?<br> - Yeah, what?<br> As an advocate for the abolition<br> of slavery, will you help us?<br> I'm neither friend nor foe to the<br> abolitionist cause. I won't help you.<br> Sir...<br> - What?<br> - I know you, Mr. President.<br> I know you and your presidency as<br> well as any man, and your father's.<br> You were a child at his side<br> when he helped invent America.<br> You, in turn, have devoted your life<br> to refining that noble invention.<br> There remains but one task undone.<br> One vital task the Founding<br> Fathers left to their sons,<br> before their 13 colonies could<br> precisely be called United States.<br> And that task, sir, as you<br> well know, is crushing slavery.<br> Your record confirms you're an<br> abolitionist, sir, even if you won't.<br> - And whether or not you admit it...<br> - Mr. Joadson.<br> ..you belong with us.<br> You're quite the scholar,<br> Mr. Joadson, aren't ya?<br> Quite the historian.<br> Let me tell you about<br> that quality, if I might.<br> Without an accompanying mastery of at<br> least one-tenth its measure of grace,<br> such erudition is worthless, sir.<br> Now, you take it from one who knows.<br> If you gentlemen will excuse me.<br> - We know we aimed high asking you...<br> - Well, aim lower!<br> Find yourselves someone<br> whose inspiration blossoms<br> the more you lose.<br> If the court<br> awards them to Spain,<br> they'll be taken to Cuba<br> and executed.<br> If the two lieutenants prevail,<br> they'll likely to sell them to Spain,<br> and they'll be executed.<br> If Montes and Ruiz are successful...<br> I'm a little confused.<br> What are they worth to you?<br> We're discussing the case,<br> not its expense.<br> Of course. Well, the case is much<br> simpler than you think, Mr. Tappan.<br> It's like anything - land,<br> livestock, heirlooms, what have you.<br> Livestock.<br> Yes. Consider -<br> the only way one may sell or purchase<br> slaves is if they are born slaves,<br> as on the plantation.<br> - I'm right, aren't I?<br> - Yes.<br> - So, are they?<br> - "Are they?"<br> Yes. Born slaves,<br> as on a plantation.<br> We're not certain,<br> but we very much doubt it.<br> Let's say they are.<br> Then they are possessions,<br> and no more deserving of<br> a criminal trial than a bookcase.<br> On the other hand,<br> let's say they aren't slaves,<br> in which case they were<br> illegally acquired.<br> Forget mutiny, forget piracy,<br> forget murder.<br> Those are irrelevant occurrences.<br> Ignore everything but<br> the pre-eminent issue at hand.<br> The wrongful transfer<br> of stolen goods.<br> Either way, we win.<br> Sir, this war must be waged on<br> the battlefield of righteousness.<br> The what?<br> It would be against<br> everything I stand for<br> to let this deteriorate into<br> an exercise in legal minutia.<br> Mr. Tappan, I'm talking about<br> the heart of the matter.<br> As am I.<br> It is our destiny,<br> as abolitionists and as Christians,<br> to save these people.<br> These are people, Mr. Baldwin,<br> not livestock.<br> Did Christ hire a lawyer<br> to get him off on technicalities?<br> He went to the cross, nobly.<br> You know why?<br> To make a statement.<br> To make a statement, as must we.<br> But Christ lost.<br> - You, I think...<br> - No, sir, he did not.<br> - You want to win, don't you?<br> - Yes.<br> I certainly do. Hell, sometimes<br> I don't get paid unless I do.<br> Which brings us back to<br> the question of worth.<br> In order to do a better job<br> than the Son of God's attorney<br> I'll require two and a<br> half dollars a day.<br> # Amazing grace<br> # How sweet the sound... #<br> # That saved a wretch like me... #<br> # I once was lost<br> # But now am found... #<br> How do you do, sir? How do you do?<br> There?<br> I'm sorry. I don't understand.<br> Excuse me. I...<br> My name is Roger Baldwin.<br> This is Theodore Joadson<br> of the Anti-slavery Society<br> and owner of the Forten<br> Shipping Service.<br> And this is Professor Gibbs,<br> a linguist.<br> Keep talking. Get them to talk.<br> Have you seen this before?<br> - This belongs to you?<br> No.<br> Umm...<br> I need to know where you're from.<br> Uh...<br> He said, I think, "Show me the map."<br> Here, Africa...<br> Is this where you're from?<br> A-fri-ca.<br> Were you born in the West Indies?<br> What did he say?<br> Oh, he said, er...<br> They have to go away.<br> - Emancipation! It's God's way!<br> You cannot own another human being!<br> - Killers of white men!<br> - Slavery is tyranny!<br> God's blessing on you this morning.<br> Yes. You place your hand on<br> this book and I'll pray for you.<br> They're<br> human beings, not animals!<br> Slavery will kill this country!<br> ... in the<br> quietude of the night<br> after the Spaniards attended their<br> vespers and were in virtuous sleep,<br> the savages broke loose<br> their collars,<br> and stole onto the deck<br> like creatures of prey.<br> They fell upon the unsuspecting crew<br> with these sabres and cane knives...<br> - I cannot overstate...<br> ... they mutilated at least one...<br> The simple cook, a Creole...<br> Their own kind.<br> But for Seors Ruiz and Montes,<br> who steered the Amistad<br> to these shores<br> under constant threat of like fate,<br> we might never have heard of<br> this massacre, this bloodbath.<br> But for their bravery, these villains<br> would have escaped justice.<br> But they've not. They've not.<br> Do you know the difference<br> between a cow and a cabbage?<br> A brick and a bear?<br> Or how about...<br> a polecat and a president?<br> The Spanish government hopes you<br> don't have much more sense than that.<br> This case isn't about murder,<br> mayhem or massacres.<br> It's not about anything<br> that dramatic.<br> This case is about knowing the<br> difference between here and there.<br> I want to show you something.<br> Open your mouth.<br> He doesn't understand.<br> He doesn't speak English.<br> Abra su boca.<br> Doesn't he understand? I thought<br> he was born on a Cuban plantation?<br> Perhaps he simply doesn't like you.<br> He wouldn't be the first,<br> Mr. Holabird.<br> Yes.<br> What, did he learn this on some Cuban<br> plantation, this decorative effect?<br> Cuban plantation!<br> Stand up. Stand up!<br> Hey. Levantate.<br> Levantate.<br> - Levantate.<br> - Stand up.<br> - Ahh!<br> Thank you.<br> Your Honour, I speak more Spanish,<br> and I was born in Philadelphia.<br> On Spanish plantations,<br> slaves choose to live<br> surrounded by their own ways<br> and simple languages.<br> Pray tell, what need they know<br> of Spanish? "Fetch? Carry? Stop?"<br> Gestures suffice for slaves,<br> as for any other beast of burden.<br> Your Honour...<br> I represent the interests<br> of Seors Ruiz and Montes.<br> - I remember.<br> - I have a bill of sale,<br> issued in Havana<br> for the purchase of slaves.<br> I remember that too.<br> On it, in addition to the amounts<br> paid for each, are their names.<br> Jose, Bernardo...<br> Paco and so on.<br> On behalf of my clients, I submit<br> this document to the court.<br> Mr. Baldwin, you've proffered<br> a good deal of - I'll be kind -<br> circumstantial evidence.<br> Have you, in addition, anything, in<br> the order of actual documentation,<br> that might refute this one,<br> and so more compellingly<br> support your claims?<br> I'm sure I could manufacture some<br> as easily as they have, Your Honour.<br> What you're saying is,<br> then, you don't.<br> Is that correct?<br> I have them.<br> I'm afraid that does not impress me.<br> I thought you did quite well.<br> You do?<br> Much better than I expected,<br> to be honest.<br> Well, thank you, I think.<br> Although, I was concerned that<br> you might have forgotten<br> - this is just a case like any other.<br> - You needn't worry about that.<br> That's good.<br> Hello, Cinque.<br> My name is Roger Baldwin.<br> I'll be your attorney.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> All right.<br> I need to prove where you're from.<br> How are you supposed to tell me?<br> You go.<br> Here. This is where I'm from.<br> Here. This.<br> All of this. All of this is...<br> is... my home.<br> Here.<br> Cuba. Cuba's an island.<br> The Amistad. This is where...<br> where you...<br> where everyone... was killed.<br> Here. Cuba, the Amistad.<br> Now, Cuba... Is this your home?<br> I don't think so.<br> But... Excuse me.<br> Now...<br> Africa.<br> This is your home, isn't it?<br> This... is... your home.<br> Yes?<br> You came...<br> all the way...<br> from... here.<br> Secure the ballast, transport!<br> Put your backs into it, boys.<br> This is a court order granting us<br> permission to search this vessel.<br> - What did they want?<br> - To come aboard.<br> I informed them they needed to obtain<br> one of these... an authentic one.<br> Aren't you coming?<br> Heave-ho!<br> My light! Light... ?<br> Light the lamp, Mr. Baldwin.<br> I'm trying.<br> Mr. Joadson!<br> Here.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yes.<br> These papers - and I shall<br> ask you to examine them -<br> are portions of a ship's manifest I<br> retrieved from the Amistad yesterday.<br> At first glance, they may appear<br> to bolster the prosecution's case.<br> You see, they list cargo.<br> Cargo bearing the very Spanish names<br> Messrs Ruiz and Montes<br> insist represent my clients,<br> hand-scrawled in the margins.<br> But no, this is not the manifest<br> of the Amistad at all. Look.<br> This is part of the cargo manifest<br> of a Portuguese vessel,<br> the notorious transatlantic<br> slave ship the Tecora.<br> The Tecora.<br> I can bring you as many witnesses<br> as you wish, Mr. Holabird...<br> Tecora!<br> Their clients trade primarily off<br> the coast of West Africa.<br> The Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> Sierra Leone is a protectorate<br> of the British Crown.<br> Slavery is outlawed there.<br> Its principal port, in fact,<br> has been re-christened "Freetown".<br> How, then, can the<br> Portuguese Tecora...<br> engage in the slave trades<br> in these waters?<br> I'll tell you how. In a word...<br> Illegally.<br> Whatever these men say<br> clearly matters not<br> because this proves them liars.<br> My clients' journey<br> did not begin in Havana,<br> as they keep claiming more<br> and more emphatically.<br> No, my clients' journey...<br> began much, much further away.<br> I underestimated you, sir!<br> I really did!<br> - I should take that as a compliment.<br> - Oh, you should indeed, sir.<br> I can't imagine there's no not<br> reaching a favourable conclusion...<br> Hey! Hey!<br> A-Am I bleeding?<br> There's nothing there.<br> What did I do to deserve this?<br> You took the case, Mr. Baldwin.<br> You took the case, sir.<br> I should take that as a compliment.<br> "As you may perceive,<br> "I wish you to act promptly<br> "before this matter becomes<br> a weight on our two countries."<br> Uh, "great countries."<br> "Our great countries.<br> "After all, the business of<br> great countries is to do business."<br> Excelente, Su Alteza.<br> "Slavery is our pillar of<br> commerce in the New World.<br> "Without it, our goodwill<br> and excellent trade relations sh... "<br> - Uh, "should be imperilled."<br> - "Should be imperilled.<br> "Without it, we might<br> have been denied the glory<br> "of aiding you in your rebellion<br> against the British.<br> "As slave-owning nations,<br> we must together stand firm.<br> "Speak the words of humaneness<br> for the masses of your citizens,<br> "but hold tightly to the power<br> that protects them.<br> "That power, of course,<br> is their wealth.<br> "The Africans must never go free.<br> "With sincerest admiration,<br> "Isabella the Second,<br> Queen of all of Spain."<br> I am not about to bend to the will<br> of some pubescent queen.<br> Forget about them.<br> They're unimportant.<br> - Prepubescent.<br> - You need to concern yourself<br> with what this matter means here,<br> not an ocean away.<br> Someone would tell me what it means!<br> Leder, you yourself<br> said it was meaningless.<br> Well, not any more.<br> - John Calhoun paid me a visit.<br> - Oh, God.<br> To explain to me why this case<br> is of much greater import...<br> - much greater symbolism, to use his<br> word - to the South than the North.<br> If the Africans are executed,<br> the abolitionists will<br> make good use of it.<br> And yes, they will make<br> some converts.<br> If, on the other hand,<br> they are freed,<br> Calhoun says the Southern states<br> will so ally themselves against you<br> that you can forget<br> about re-election.<br> - Over this?<br> - It's worse than that.<br> Worse? What could be<br> worse than that?<br> Calhoun believes, and I am not sure<br> I can disagree with him,<br> that this could take us all<br> one long step closer to civil war.<br> - This?<br> - Yes, Mr. President.<br> But all is not lost.<br> The jury appears likely to free them,<br> but juries can be dismissed.<br> They can?<br> But I believe we must go further<br> and remove the judge.<br> We can do that?<br> He could be prevailed upon to<br> recuse himself for various reasons.<br> With that in mind,<br> I've taken the liberty of<br> exploring possible replacements.<br> I've found one I strongly<br> believe to be better.<br> He's young, which means he has a<br> career before him rather than behind,<br> he has yet to feel the hankering<br> for magnanimous last gestures<br> for the sake of posterity.<br> And he is monumentally insecure,<br> particularly about<br> his Catholic heritage.<br> - He's Catholic?<br> - His grandfather was Catholic,<br> which young Mr. Coglin has striven<br> all his days to keep quiet.<br> Mr. President, Judge Coglin.<br> Judge Coglin,<br> we are so pleased to meet you.<br> Thank you so much for coming.<br> I've been reading in the papers<br> the continuing saga<br> of the, uh, Amistad.<br> Real papers.<br> Real papers. Yes, sir.<br> Yes. Bad luck,<br> this last unfolding chapter.<br> What to do now, eh?<br> Which is why I came here<br> and imposed on you, sir.<br> No imposition... really.<br> Yeah.<br> How did that, uh...<br> How did that young lawyer<br> take the news?<br> Oh, in stride, sir. In stride.<br> The thing is, sir,<br> he did everything right.<br> - He proved the case.<br> - Did he?<br> Oh, yes, sir. Surprisingly, he did.<br> Hmm. Good.<br> Well, he'll just have<br> to do it again, then.<br> But like most things, it should<br> be easier second time around.<br> Well, I'm afraid it doesn't matter<br> what he does now, sir.<br> Rumour has it our next judge<br> was hand-picked by Van Buren himself.<br> No!<br> I'm embarrassed to admit that<br> I was under the misconception<br> that our executive<br> and judicial branches were separate.<br> No more so than these, Mr. Joadson.<br> No more so than these.<br> - So now you know.<br> - Yes.<br> - Sir?<br> - Yeah?<br> Mr. President, if it was you<br> handling the case...<br> Well, it isn't me.<br> And thank God for that.<br> - But if it was, sir,<br> - Huh?<br> What would you do?<br> Well, when I was an attorney,<br> a long time ago, young man,<br> I, er, I realised<br> after much trial and error,<br> that in a courtroom,<br> whoever tells<br> the best story wins.<br> In unlawyer-like fashion, I give you<br> that scrap of wisdom free of charge.<br> I'm much obliged<br> for your time, sir.<br> What is their story,<br> by the way?<br> - Sir?<br> - What is their story?<br> Why, they're, um,...<br> from West Africa.<br> No. What is their story?<br> Mr. Joadson, you're<br> from where originally?<br> Why, Georgia, sir.<br> - Georgia.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Does that sum up what you are?<br> A Georgian? Is that your story?<br> No. You're an ex-slave,<br> who's devoted his life<br> to the abolition of slavery,<br> and overcoming great hardships<br> along the way, I should imagine.<br> That's your story, isn't it?<br> You and this young so-called lawyer<br> have proven you know what they are.<br> They're Africans. Congratulations.<br> What you don't know, and haven't<br> bothered in the least to discover,<br> is who they are.<br> Right?<br> Seven.<br> Eight.<br> Number nine...<br> and ten.<br> Now, how about you, Mr. Baldwin?<br> Would you like to count<br> from one to ten?<br> One to ten in Mende.<br> - One.<br> - Ta.<br> - Two.<br> - Fele.<br> - Three.<br> - Sawa.<br> - Four.<br> - Nanee.<br> Right. Five.<br> Lorlu.<br> Fresh fruit!<br> Straight from the Caribbean!<br> - Sawa, nanee, lorlu...<br> - What's happened here?<br> - One of them died last night.<br> We tried to take the body<br> away to bury it.<br> What do they want?<br> They want to live with it?<br> They want to bury him.<br> They have to bury him<br> according to their poro beliefs.<br> Otherwise, his soul<br> will haunt them.<br> # The house of Thine abode<br> # With His own precious son... #<br> # The house of Thine abode<br> # The church of<br> blessed redeemers... #<br> If I were you, if I ran this place,<br> I'd set protocol aside just<br> this once and let them bury him.<br> # I love Thy kingdom, Lord... #<br> I was thinking the same thing.<br> A problem has arisen.<br> The judge we had,<br> who believed, I believe,<br> that you should be freed,<br> has been dismissed.<br> A new judge has been called upon<br> to hear the case,<br> this time without a jury.<br> How is that possible?<br> A chief cannot be replaced.<br> I can't explain it in any way<br> that you would understand, Cinque.<br> Or me, for that matter.<br> Only that, well, it has happened.<br> I am not a great orator<br> or advisor, Cinque.<br> I'm not a big man in my profession.<br> I don't know if I alone can convince<br> this next judge to set you free.<br> I need your help.<br> When we go to court,<br> I need you to speak.<br> I'm not<br> an advisor of any kind.<br> I cannot speak for the others.<br> Cinque, the others, they say you can.<br> They say you're the big man here.<br> I am not.<br> What's this I hear about a lion?<br> They say you alone - alone, Cinque -<br> slew the most terrifying beast<br> anyone has ever seen.<br> Is it not true?<br> It had killed several people.<br> Even hunters among us.<br> Everyone including me was afraid.<br> I was lying down with my family,<br> when out of nowhere it appeared.<br> As it came for me<br> I picked up this big rock<br> and I threw it.<br> And by some miracle,<br> you see, I hit it.<br> He don't know how<br> that killed it, but it did.<br> A rock.<br> A rock.<br> I received the gratitude<br> of everyone in the village.<br> I was given respect.<br> They treated me<br> as if I was a prince.<br> They gave me<br> the fine country cloth.<br> All these things they gave me,<br> I took them all.<br> But I knew<br> I didn't deserve it.<br> For when I threw that rock at<br> that beast... if I had missed him...<br> He said he wouldn't be here<br> trying to explain these things.<br> He'd just be dead.<br> Understand?<br> Understand?<br> I'm not a big man.<br> Just a lucky one.<br> I might agree with you, Cinque,<br> except you're forgetting something.<br> The other lion.<br> The Amistad, Cinque.<br> The insurrection.<br> That too was an accident?<br> I hardly think so.<br> That wasn't bravery.<br> Any man would do the same<br> to get back to his family.<br> You yourself would do it.<br> Someone said that might be yours.<br> 'My wife gave it to me.'<br> 'To keep me safe.'<br> Cinque...<br> I need you to tell me<br> how you got here.<br> I wanted to kill them too.<br> For they convinced some of us<br> that they would take us back home.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Mr. Holabird.<br> Quite a tale.<br> Intrigue, abduction,<br> courage in the face<br> of unspeakable suffering.<br> And all true. All right.<br> Now tell me if this is true.<br> Some tribes in Africa, for hundreds<br> of years - thousands, perhaps -<br> have owned slaves.<br> Translate.<br> Yes.<br> Under what circumstances might one<br> become a slave among the Mende,<br> of which you claim to belong?<br> Translate.<br> Wars, debts.<br> Oh, I see. And how many men<br> are indebted to you ?<br> I don't think you do see.<br> Mr. Holabird is trying<br> to intimidate my colleague.<br> The Mende word for "slave"<br> is closer to "worker".<br> Do these workers own the land<br> they work on? Do they receive wages?<br> Are these workers free to not work<br> for you, if they so choose?<br> He's questioning the translator!<br> The translator is answering<br> for the witness.<br> - The witness isn't getting a chance!<br> - Mr. Baldwin!<br> Fine, Mr. Baldwin! Slavery,<br> indentured servitude.<br> Whatever they want to call it,<br> the concept is the same.<br> Now, he is familiar with the concept.<br> When you come down to it,<br> it's all about money, isn't it?<br> Slaves, production, money.<br> I mean, that's the idea of it.<br> Whether it's here or there.<br> I'm confused.<br> Do your people routinely<br> slaughter their slaves<br> in the manner that you just<br> so vividly described to us?<br> Of course they don't.<br> What would be the point of that?<br> Killing your own slaves is like<br> burning down your own house or hut,<br> isn't it?<br> How do you explain that paradox?<br> I don't understand what you mean.<br> Sure you do.<br> As does everyone here.<br> The behaviour you attribute to<br> your tormentors - your victims -<br> and therefore every other<br> aspect of your testimony,<br> makes no sense.<br> - Not even to you.<br> But thank you. Like all good works<br> of fiction, it was entertaining.<br> Nothing more.<br> Captain Fitzgerald,<br> please explain your duties<br> in Her Majesty's navy.<br> To patrol the Ivory Coast<br> for slave ships.<br> Because?<br> Because slavery is banned<br> in British law, sir.<br> Yet the abduction of men from the<br> British protectorate of Sierra Leone<br> and their illegal transportation<br> as described by Cinque,<br> - is not unheard of, is it?<br> - Not even unusual, regrettably.<br> What, if anything, in his account of<br> his ordeal, do you find believable?<br> His description of the slave<br> fortress, for one thing.<br> There is such a place.<br> You've seen it?<br> No, sir. We've not<br> managed to locate it,<br> but there is overwhelming<br> evidence that it is real.<br> What evidence, exactly? Rumour?<br> Reports.<br> By "reports" you mean of the variety<br> Cinque shared with us today?<br> Its existence, sir,<br> has been reported.<br> Cinque describes<br> the cold-blooded murder<br> of many of the people<br> on board the Tecora.<br> Mr. Holabird sees this as a paradox.<br> Do you, sir?<br> Often when slavers are intercepted,<br> or believe they may be,<br> they simply throw all<br> their prisoners overboard<br> and thereby rid themselves<br> of the evidence of their crime.<br> - Drown hundreds of people?<br> - Yes.<br> It hardly seems a lucrative<br> business to me,<br> going to all that trouble rounding<br> men up only to throw them overboard.<br> No, it's very lucrative.<br> If only we could corroborate<br> Cinque's story somehow with...<br> with evidence of some kind.<br> The inventory.<br> This? From the Tecora?<br> If you look, there's<br> a notation made on May 10,<br> correcting the number of slaves on<br> board, reducing their number by 50.<br> What does that mean?<br> If you look at it in conjunction<br> with Cinque's testimony,<br> I would say that it means this:<br> The crew greatly underestimated<br> the amount of provisions<br> required for their journey,<br> and solved the problem<br> by throwing 50 people overboard.<br> I'm looking at<br> the inventory, Captain,<br> and I'm sorry, I don't<br> see where it says,<br> "This morning, we threw<br> On May 10 or any other day.<br> As of course you would not.<br> I do see that<br> the cargo weight changed.<br> They reduced the poundage,<br> I see, but that is all.<br> It's simple, ghastly arithmetic.<br> Well, for you, perhaps.<br> I may need a quill and parchment<br> and a better imagination.<br> And what poundage do you imagine<br> the entry may refer to, sir?<br> A mast and sails, perhaps?<br> Give us... us... free.<br> Give... us...<br> free.<br> Give us, us free.<br> Give... us... free.<br> Your Honour, please<br> instruct the defendant<br> not to disrupt proceedings<br> with such outbursts.<br> Give us, us free!<br> If we are to have any semblance<br> of order in court...<br> Give us, us free! Give us, us free!<br> He cannot keep crying out<br> "Give us free"...<br> Give us, us free!<br> ... while I am questioning<br> this witness!<br> GIVE US, US FREE!<br> GIVE US, US FREE!<br> All rise.<br> After careful review<br> and thorough reflection,<br> I find it impossible to deny the<br> power of the government's position.<br> There is no doubt in my mind<br> that District Attorney Holabird,<br> Her Catholic Majesty,<br> Isabella of Spain,<br> and her trusted minister,<br> Seor Calderon,<br> have all proceeded<br> with the utmost faith<br> in the soundness of their case.<br> I also believe<br> that Seors Ruiz and Montes<br> may have... misrepresented<br> the origin of the prisoners,<br> an issue which weighs<br> crucially upon their fate,<br> and that of the Spaniards as well.<br> Were they born in Africa?<br> Since the answer to that question<br> shall govern every determination<br> of this court, I ask it again.<br> Were they born in Africa?<br> I believe they were.<br> As such, Her Catholic Majesty's<br> claims of ownership have no merit.<br> Neither do those for salvage<br> made by Lieutenants Mead and Gedney.<br> I hereby order the arrest<br> and detention<br> of Seors Ruiz and Montes..<br> ... by federal mar...<br> By federal marshals... on<br> the charge of slave-trading!<br> The release of the Africans<br> and their conveyance,<br> by this government,<br> at her earliest<br> convenience and expense,<br> back to their homes in Africa!<br> Yes!<br> We've done it, Joadson!<br> We've done it! Yes!<br> Covey, tell them! Tell them now!<br> Look at 'em!<br> What's most bewildering<br> to Her Majesty<br> is this arrogant independence<br> of the American courts.<br> After all, if you cannot<br> rule the courts, you cannot rule.<br> Seor Calderon, as any<br> true American will tell you,<br> its the independence of our courts<br> that keeps us free.<br> John... I'm glad you came.<br> Mr. President?<br> Senator Calhoun is here.<br> John! I was afraid you weren't<br> going to be able to join us.<br> - You may put that fear to rest, sir.<br> - Oh, thank you! Please.<br> I'd like you to meet Seor Calderon,<br> ambassador from Spain.<br> Buenas noches, Seor Ambassador.<br> - Thought you said he wasn't coming.<br> - He said he wasn't.<br> You see, Seor Calderon,<br> there's a growing number of people<br> in this part of the country<br> that regard us in the South<br> as not only geographically<br> beneath them.<br> They ignore the fact<br> that slavery is so interwoven<br> into the fabric of this society,<br> that to destroy it would be<br> to destroy us as a people.<br> It's immoral. That's all they know.<br> Therefore, so are we.<br> Immoral and inferior.<br> We are inferior in one area.<br> We're not as proficient<br> in the art of gain.<br> We're not as wealthy<br> as our northern neighbors.<br> We're still struggling.<br> Take away our life's blood now...<br> Well, we all know<br> what happens then.<br> North and South.<br> They become the masters,<br> and we the slaves.<br> But not without a fight.<br> Senator Calhoun is being modest.<br> He's not inferior in another area -<br> the art of exaggeration.<br> Ask yourself, Seor Calderon...<br> What court wants to be responsible<br> for the spark that ignites<br> the firestorm?<br> What president<br> wants to be in office...<br> when it comes crashing<br> down around him?<br> Certainly no court before this one.<br> Certainly no president<br> before this one.<br> So...<br> Judge us not too harshly, sir,<br> and bid Her Majesty like.<br> Because the real determination our<br> courts and our president must make<br> is not whether this<br> ragtag group of Africans<br> raised swords against their enemy,<br> but rather... must we?<br> Whoa!<br> Come along, Mr. Joadson.<br> This news...<br> Well, of course,<br> it's bad news, but...<br> They may be more valuable to our<br> struggle in death than in life.<br> Martyrdom, Mr. Joadson.<br> From the dawn of Christianity,<br> we have seen no stronger<br> power for change.<br> You know it's true.<br> What is true, Mr. Tappan -<br> and believe me when I tell you,<br> I've seen this -<br> is that there are men whose hatred of<br> slavery is stronger than anything,<br> except for the slave himself.<br> If you wish to inspire such hatred<br> in a man, Mr. Joadson,<br> speak to him in that fashion<br> and it may come true.<br> Our president,<br> our big, big man,<br> has appealed the decision<br> to our Supreme Court.<br> What does that mean?<br> We have to try the case again.<br> Now, I-I know it's hard<br> to understand, Cinque.<br> I don't understand, for that matter.<br> You said there would be<br> a judgment, and we would go free.<br> No, no. What I said is that we won<br> it at the state level.<br> I said if we won it at the<br> state level, we then go on.<br> That's what you said!<br> - That's what you said!<br> - All right! Yes, I said it!<br> I said it, but I shouldn't have.<br> What I should have said...<br> - I can't translate that.<br> - You can't translate what?<br> - I can't translate "should".<br> - There's no Mende word for "should"?<br> No. Either you do something,<br> or you don't do it.<br> What I meant to say, what I meant...<br> Not in the way you mean it.<br> Try and understand me.<br> "Meant" is the same as "should".<br> You're misunderstanding the language.<br> Cinque! Listen to me.<br> Understand what I'm saying.<br> What I said to you<br> before the judgment<br> is almost how it works here.<br> Almost!<br> Almost?<br> Yes, Cinque. But not always.<br> Yes. And that's what's happened here.<br> "To His Excellency,<br> John Quincy Adams,<br> "Massachusetts member,<br> House of Representatives.<br> "I have understood from Mr. Joadson<br> "that you are acquainted with<br> the plight of the Amistad Africans.<br> "If that is true, then you are<br> aware that we have been,<br> "at every step, successful in<br> our presentation of their case.<br> "Despite this,<br> "and despite the unlikelihood of<br> President Van Buren's re-election,<br> "he has appealed our most recent<br> favourable decision<br> "to the highest court in the land.<br> "As I'm sure you are well aware,<br> "seven of nine of these<br> Supreme Court justices<br> "are themselves Southern<br> slave owners.<br> "Sir, we need you.<br> "If ever there was a time for a man<br> to cast aside his daily trappings<br> "and array himself for battle,<br> that time has come."<br> Thank you.<br> "Cicero said, appealing to Claudius<br> in defence of the Republic,<br> "that 'the result of this war<br> "depends on the life of one<br> most brave and excellent man.'<br> "In our time, in this instance,<br> I believe it depends on two.<br> "A courageous man, at present<br> in irons, named Cinque,<br> "and you, sir.<br> "Sincerely, Roger S Baldwin,<br> attorney-at-law."<br> Mr. Tippings, excuse me<br> a moment, please.<br> - Any word from... ?<br> - What did Cinque say?<br> He won't talk to you.<br> He won't talk to me?<br> No.<br> How's your English coming?<br> No better than my Mende, I suppose.<br> Cinque, I know this isn't something<br> you necessarily want to think about,<br> but has it occurred to you<br> that I'm all you've got?<br> Because, since my practice has<br> now completely deteriorated,<br> you're all I've got.<br> See, this is me. You see?<br> You see? You see how this works?<br> And-And-And this, this here,<br> Cinque, is for me. Hmm?<br> More death threats.<br> Some have been signed.<br> By my own clients, no less.<br> I should say, should say...<br> former clients, shouldn't I?<br> There is one more consequence<br> to having no clientele to speak of.<br> I am now free to sit here<br> as long as it takes<br> for you to acknowledge me.<br> Yes, you understood that word,<br> didn't you?<br> Free.<br> All right.<br> Then we'll just sit.<br> Caesar.<br> Cicero's appeal was to<br> Julius Caesar, not Claudius.<br> Claudius would not be born<br> for another hundred years.<br> You were right,<br> there was one of them.<br> - Is that him?<br> - Yes, Mr. President.<br> Please unlock this door.<br> Adams has flirted with abolitionists<br> for 15 years,<br> but has yet to take one home.<br> - How old is he?<br> - Too old to take anyone home!<br> He sleeps through three quarters<br> of the sessions on the Hill.<br> Let's see. President,<br> slumbering congressman,<br> jailhouse lawyer - one waits with<br> great anticipation for what's next!<br> - What must that be like?<br> - What?<br> Knowing all your life,<br> whatever your accomplishments,<br> you'll only be remembered<br> as the son of a great father.<br> The only thing John Quincy Adams will<br> remembered for is his middle name!<br> I wonder, is there anything<br> as pathetic as an ex-president?<br> I was talking about John...<br> - Sir.<br> - Yes?<br> Cinque has asked me t-t-to ask you...<br> whether you have thought about<br> the question of jurisdiction.<br> What?<br> That since they took over<br> the ship far out to sea,<br> and since neither Spain<br> nor America owns the sea,<br> how is it that the treaty applies?<br> Tell him the treaty recognises<br> no jurisdictional limitations.<br> He will ask me why.<br> Because I said so.<br> - Excuse me, sir.<br> - Yes?<br> Cinque would like to know that if he<br> is the property of Ruiz and Montes,<br> then how does the treaty apply,<br> as it is between America and Spain?<br> Or their citizens.<br> "Or their citizens" is included<br> in the language, if he must know.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> It's a good point, though.<br> Does Britain have any treaties with<br> West Africa which may override<br> - those between Spain and America?<br> - No.<br> Does Britain have any<br> treaties with America<br> - which might override those...<br> - No.<br> Does America have treaties<br> with West Africa?<br> No!<br> - Does Spain?<br> - No!<br> Does the Commonwealth of Connecticut<br> - have any treaties with West Africa?<br> - No, no, no, no! Now stop this!<br> Unshackle him.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> - I'm under strict orders...<br> - Unshackle him, please.<br> Yes, Mr. President.<br> This is a phalaenopsis, moth orchid,<br> I brought over from China.<br> And this is a primrose<br> from an English garden.<br> And, uh, this spear lily,<br> from the south of France.<br> This is my rose Blush Noisette.<br> This came all the way from,<br> uh, Washington, DC,<br> but don't tell anyone.<br> Hmm.<br> Go on, go on.<br> African violet. I can't tell you<br> how difficult that was to come by.<br> Now, you understand you're going<br> to the Supreme Court.<br> Do you know why?<br> It is the place where<br> they finally kill us.<br> No. Well, yes,<br> that may be true too.<br> That's not what I meant.<br> No, there is another reason<br> and a more important reason.<br> Although I'll admit that, uh,<br> perhaps more so to us than you.<br> All right, don't...<br> Cinque...<br> Do you know who I am?<br> Has anyone told you about me?<br> What have they told you?<br> That you are a chief.<br> I was a chief, yes.<br> A chief cannot become anything less<br> than a chief, even in death.<br> Oh, how I wish such<br> were true here, Cinque.<br> You've no idea.<br> One tries to govern<br> wisely, strongly, but...<br> One tries to govern in a way that<br> betters the lives of one's villagers.<br> One tries to... kill the lion.<br> Unfortunately, one isn't always<br> wise enough or strong enough.<br> Time passes...<br> and the moment is gone.<br> Now, listen, Cinque. Listen.<br> We're about... We're about<br> to bring your case<br> before the highest court<br> in our land.<br> Were about to do battle with a lion<br> that is threatening<br> to rip our country in two.<br> Huh? And all we have on our side<br> is a rock.<br> Of course, you didn't ask<br> to be at the centre<br> of this historic conflagration<br> any more than I did,<br> but we find ourselves here,<br> nonetheless,<br> by some mysterious mix<br> of circumstances<br> and the whole world watching.<br> So, uh, what are we to do? Huh?<br> - What did he just say?<br> - I-I... Sorry, I didn't catch it.<br> Cinque, look.<br> I'm being honest with you.<br> Anything less would be<br> disrespectful.<br> I'm telling you, I'm preparing you,<br> I suppose I'm explaining to you,<br> that the test ahead of us is<br> an exceptionally difficult one.<br> We won't be going in there alone.<br> Alone? Indeed not.<br> We have right at our side.<br> We have righteousness at our side.<br> We have Mr. Baldwin over there.<br> I meant my ancestors.<br> I will call into the past,<br> far back to the beginning of time,<br> and beg them to come and help me<br> at the judgment.<br> I will reach back<br> and draw them into me.<br> And they must come,<br> for at this moment, I am the whole<br> reason they have existed at all.<br> Your Honours...<br> I derive much consolation<br> from the fact that my colleague,<br> Mr. Baldwin here,<br> has argued the case<br> in so able, and so complete a manner<br> as to leave me scarcely<br> anything to say.<br> However...<br> Why are we here?<br> How is it that a simple,<br> plain property issue<br> should now find itself<br> so ennobled as to be argued<br> before the Supreme Court of<br> the United States of America?<br> Do we fear the lower courts, which<br> found for us, missed the truth?<br> Or is it, rather, our great<br> and consuming fear of civil war,<br> that has allowed us to heap symbolism<br> upon a simple case<br> that never asked for it?<br> And now would have us disregard truth<br> even as it stands before us,<br> tall and proud as a mountain.<br> The truth... in truth, has been driven<br> from this case like a slave.<br> Flogged from court to court,<br> wretched and destitute.<br> And not by any great legal acumen<br> on the part of the opposition,<br> I might add.<br> But through the long, powerful arm<br> of the executive office.<br> This is no mere property<br> case, gentlemen.<br> This is the most important case<br> ever to come before this court.<br> Because what it in fact concerns<br> is the very nature of man.<br> Uh, these are, um...<br> These are transcriptions of letters<br> written between our<br> secretary of state, John Forsyth,<br> and the Queen of Spain,<br> Isabella the Second.<br> Now, I ask that you accept<br> their perusal<br> as part of your deliberations.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I would not touch on them now<br> except to notice<br> a curious phrase<br> which is much repeated.<br> The Queen again and again refers<br> to our incompetent courts.<br> Now what, I wonder, would be<br> more to her liking? Huh?<br> A court that finds against<br> the Africans?<br> Well, I think not.<br> And here is the fine point of it.<br> What Her Majesty wants is a court<br> that behaves just like her courts.<br> The courts this 11-year-old child<br> plays with in her magical kingdom<br> called Spain.<br> A court that will do what it is told.<br> A court that can be toyed with<br> like a doll.<br> A court, as it happens,<br> of which our own president,<br> Martin Van Buren,<br> would be most proud.<br> Thank you.<br> This is a publication<br> of the office of the President.<br> It's called "The Executive Review",<br> and I'm sure you all read it.<br> At least I'm sure the President<br> hopes you all read it.<br> This is a recent issue, and there's,<br> uh, an article in here,<br> written by "a keen mind<br> of the South", who...<br> My former vice-president,<br> John Calhoun, perhaps.<br> Could it be?<br> Who asserts that "there has never<br> existed a civilized society<br> "in which one segment did not<br> thrive upon the labour of another.<br> "As far back as one chooses to look,<br> "to ancient times, to Biblical times,<br> "history bears this out.<br> "In Eden, where only two<br> were created.<br> "Even there, one was pronounced<br> subordinate to the other.<br> "Slavery has always been with us,<br> "and is neither sinful nor immoral.<br> "Rather, as war and antagonism<br> are the natural states of man,<br> "so, too, slavery, as natural<br> as it is inevitable."<br> Well, gentlemen, I differ with<br> the keen minds of the South,<br> and with our president,<br> who apparently shares their views,<br> offering that the natural state<br> of mankind is instead -<br> and I know this is<br> a controversial idea -<br> is freedom.<br> Is freedom.<br> The proof is the length to which<br> a man, woman or child will go<br> to regain it, once taken.<br> He will break loose his chains.<br> He will... decimate his enemies.<br> He will try and try and try,<br> against all odds,<br> against all prejudices,<br> to get home.<br> Cinque, would you stand up,<br> if you would,<br> so everyone can see you.<br> This man is black.<br> We can all see that.<br> But can we also see as easily<br> that which is equally true?<br> That he is the only<br> true hero in this room.<br> If he were white,<br> he wouldn't be in this court,<br> fighting for his life.<br> If he were white<br> and his enslavers British,<br> he'd be weighed down by the medals<br> and honours we would bestow upon him.<br> Songs would be written about him.<br> The great authors of our times<br> would fill books about him.<br> His story would be told<br> and retold, in our classrooms.<br> Our children, because we would<br> make sure of it,<br> would know his name as well as<br> they know Patrick Henry's.<br> Yet, if the South is right,<br> what are we to do with that<br> embarrassing, annoying document,<br> "The Declaration of Independence"?<br> What of its conceits?<br> "All men created equal," "inalienable<br> rights," "life, liberty," and so on.<br> What on Earth are we<br> to do with this?<br> I have a modest suggestion.<br> The other night I was talking<br> with my friend Cinque.<br> He was over at my place, and we were<br> out in the greenhouse together.<br> He explained to me how when a member<br> of the Mende - that's his people...<br> How when a member of the Mende<br> encounters a situation<br> where there appears<br> no hope at all,<br> he invokes his ancestors.<br> Tradition.<br> The Mende believe that if one can<br> summon the spirit of one's ancestors,<br> then they have never left.<br> And the wisdom and strength<br> they fathered and inspired<br> will come to his aid.<br> James Madison,<br> Alexander Hamilton,<br> Benjamin Franklin,<br> Thomas Jefferson,<br> George Washington,<br> John Adams.<br> We have long resisted<br> asking your for guidance.<br> Perhaps we have feared<br> in doing so,<br> we might acknowledge<br> that our individuality,<br> which we so, so revere,<br> is not entirely our own.<br> Perhaps were feared an... an appeal<br> to you might be taken for weakness.<br> But we have come to understand,<br> finally, that this is not so.<br> We understand now...<br> We've been made to understand,<br> and to embrace the understanding<br> that who we are<br> is who we were.<br> We desperately need<br> your strength and wisdom<br> to triumph over our fears,<br> our prejudices, ourselves.<br> Give us the courage<br> to do what is right.<br> And if it means civil war,<br> then let it come.<br> And when it does,<br> may it be, finally,<br> the last battle of<br> the American Revolution.<br> That's all I have to say.<br> In the case of the United<br> States of America<br> versus the Amistad Africans,<br> it is the opinion of this court<br> that our treaty of 1795 with Spain,<br> on which the prosecution has<br> primarily based its arguments,<br> is inapplicable.<br> While it is clearly stipulated<br> in Article 9 that - and I quote -<br> "Seized ships and cargo<br> "are to be returned entirely<br> to their proprietary."<br> The end of quote.<br> It has not been shown<br> to the court's satisfaction<br> that these particular Africans<br> fit that description.<br> We are then left with the alternative<br> that they are not slaves,<br> and therefore cannot<br> be considered merchandise,<br> but are, rather, free individuals<br> with certain legal and moral rights,<br> including the right<br> to engage in insurrection<br> against those who would deny them<br> their freedom.<br> And therefore, over one dissent,<br> it is the court's judgment<br> that the defendants are to be<br> released from custody at once,<br> and, if they so choose,<br> to be returned<br> to their homes in Africa.<br> Thank you.<br> Well...<br> - What did you say to them?<br> - Huh?<br> What words did you use<br> to persuade them?<br> Yours.<br> To keep you safe.<br> Thank you... Baldwin.<br> Fire!<br> All clear, sir.<br> - Fire.<br> - Fire!<br> - Fire.<br> - Fire!<br> Fire.<br> Fire.<br> Fire.<br> Take a letter, Ensign.<br> "To His Honour, the United States<br> secretary of state, Mr. John Forsyth.<br> "My dear Mr. Forsyth,<br> "it is my great pleasure to inform<br> you that you are, in fact, correct.<br> "The slave fortress in Sierra Leone<br> does not exist."<br> Que bonita!<br>
