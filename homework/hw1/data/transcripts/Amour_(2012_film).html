                        This is the fire brigade.<br> Is anybody here?<br> Please wait outside.<br> What's the date of the last letter?<br> The 9th, as far as I can see.<br> The door is open!<br> ...no as far as I know.<br> During the whole time, they had a nurse,<br> but it's been a while since I last<br> saw her. My wife has been...<br> - Did you open the window?<br> - No.<br> LOVE<br> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to<br> the Thtre des Champs Elyses.<br> We ask you to turn off<br> your mobile phones.<br> and remind you that all forms of video<br> and audio recordings are prohibited.<br> We hope you enjoy the concert.<br> They used a screwdriver or something<br> similar. Doesn't look very professional.<br> - But who would do something like that?<br> - No idea.<br> Why someone would try to break in?<br> Because he wants to steal something.<br> - From us?<br> - Why not?<br> If I come to think about it<br> three or four people we know<br> have already been burgled.<br> What time is it?<br> Can't we call the caretaker?<br> I'll do that tomorrow morning.<br> Don't let this put a damper<br> on your good mood.<br> - Or call the police?<br> - Come, give me your coat.<br> Imagine if we were lying in bed<br> and somebody broke in.<br> Why should I imagine such a thing?<br> It's terrible.<br> I think I would die of fright.<br> I would too.<br> - Shall we have a drink?<br> - I'm tired.<br> I fancy another drink.<br> Do as you please.<br> Matilda told me<br> that in her building<br> burglars entered the top floor<br> through the attic.<br> They simply knocked<br> a hole into the wall,<br> cut the most valuable paintings<br> out of their frames<br> and disappeared<br> without leaving a trace.<br> That's how professionals do it.<br> Did I tell you that I thought<br> you looked very pretty tonight.<br> What's gotten into you?<br> The semi quavers in the presto<br> were incredible. What subtlety!<br> Don't you think?<br> You're proud of him, huh?<br> What's the matter.<br> Nothing.<br> Next week?<br> No. Yes.<br> No, but it would be better to fix this<br> as soon as possible.<br> It might give people silly ideas.<br> And anyway, it's ugly to look at.<br> At what time?<br> Yes, okay.<br> All right.<br> Will you also bring<br> the varnish with you?<br> But at least some primer.<br> Yes, okay.<br> Excellent.<br> Yes.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Goodbye. Thank you.<br> - He's reliable.<br> - I hope so.<br> The last time he kept us<br> waiting for ages, if you remember.<br> Yes, that's true.<br> Thank you.<br> But if I call a regular company, they<br> let us wait for at least two months.<br> Oh yeah?<br> The Frodons had to wait for three days<br> when their toilet was clogged.<br> Not exactly pleasant.<br> The salt cellar is empty.<br> I don't know if he's going<br> to bring us the CD today.<br> Maybe he won't come at all.<br> We could go to Virgin<br> this afternoon and buy it.<br> What do you say?<br> What's going on?<br> What's the matter?<br> Anne?<br> Cuckoo.<br> I'm here<br> Anne.<br> What's going on?<br> Anne, what's going on?<br> What's the matter?<br> Anne...<br> Anne, darling, please.<br> Anne, look at me.<br> What's the matter?<br> What's the matter?<br> Anne?<br> What are you doing?<br> You left the water running.<br> Hey, what's wrong with you?<br> Are you completely crazy?<br> - Is this a joke?<br> - What?<br> Is this a joke?<br> Is this supposed to be a joke?<br> What joke?<br> I don't get it.<br> Why do you talk to me in that tone?<br> What has gotten into you?<br> Please, Anne, stop this game,<br> it's not funny.<br> What game, for Christ's sake?<br> What's the matter?<br> Why did you not react?<br> - To what?<br> - To what? Uh, to everything, to me.<br> - When?<br> - Just now. A moment ago.<br> Please, tell me, what's wrong.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> You really don't remember<br> what just happened?<br> But what did happen?<br> You were sitting there,<br> staring into space<br> and you didn't answer<br> when I asked you what the matter was.<br> I took this towel and put it<br> on your face but you didn't react.<br> Look, there's still dampness<br> on your collar.<br> And when... when was it?<br> Just now, a couple of minutes ago.<br> - So?<br> - So? There's no "so".<br> I went into the bedroom to get dressed.<br> I wanted to get help.<br> - Help?<br> - Yes.<br> But then you turned off the tap.<br> Yes, because you left it on.<br> I don't understand.<br> Me neither.<br> I should call Dr. Bertier.<br> - Why? What can he do?<br> - I don't know. Examine you.<br> I am fine, I am fine.<br> Please, Anne.<br> It's absurd, we cannot go on<br> as if nothing had happened.<br> But what did happen?<br> I'm sitting here, having breakfast<br> and you're telling me things<br> I don't understand.<br> Can you explain to me<br> how the tea towel got here?<br> No.<br> - Who turned the tap on?<br> - You did.<br> - Oh, you remember that?<br> - No.<br> Do you want to torture me?<br> Leave me in peace.<br> Don't you think<br> I'd better call Dr. Bertier?<br> No!<br> You know how he is.<br> Once he's got something into his head,<br> he has to go through with it.<br> In the end<br> everyone was delighted.<br> Besides, it didn't hurt<br> our financial situation.<br> So, we're playing until the 28th,<br> then we have a ten-day break<br> then we go to Stockholm for four days<br> and then to Kuhmo in Finland.<br> I don't know where that is.<br> At the North Pole.<br> Geoff has already been there a few times,<br> he loves it.<br> We're playing the "Dowland<br> Transcriptions" there.<br> Then we return to London.<br> What about the children?<br> Liz is at her boarding school<br> and John lives his own life. He's 26.<br> What does he do?<br> He works.<br> He is very independent.<br> We rarely see him.<br> A bit like Geoff.<br> They don't really get along.<br> Geoff wants to advise him on everything.<br> John doesn't like that at all.<br> - Is he good?<br> - Yes, I think so.<br> He is less impulsive,<br> but very industrious.<br> This sounds rather depreciatory.<br> No. He's just not like Geoff.<br> He is...<br> calm, but stubborn.<br> I think he'll do all right.<br> The other day he played the solo part<br> of the Haydn concerto<br> at the conservatoire's last concert.<br> It was very good.<br> Geoff was there<br> and he congratulated him at the end.<br> And you?<br> What do you mean?<br> Did you both make up?<br> Oh, you know him.<br> In September, he discovered his love<br> for a violinist,<br> who had been in our ensemble<br> for many years.<br> What can I tell you?<br> It was a huge drama.<br> She tried to commit suicide.<br> That scared him.<br> He returned to me, devoured by remorse.<br> I've got used to it by now, but...<br> I feel embarrassed because<br> the whole ensemble knows about it.<br> Do you love him?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> What about the surgery?<br> What do you want me to explain?<br> They made a test,<br> said the carotid artery was blocked<br> and that surgery would be necessary.<br> She was scared.<br> Totally confused, frightened.<br> You know<br> she's always been afraid of doctors.<br> They said the risk was very low<br> and that if they didn't operate,<br> she'd be certain<br> to have another, more serious stroke.<br> And what do they say now?<br> That it didn't go well.<br> It's one of the 5% that go wrong.<br> It's pretty upsetting.<br> Usually at this time, I take a nap.<br> My blood sugar<br> is somewhere down in my socks.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - Yes.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - Nothing.<br> It was very nice of you to come<br> despite all of your stress.<br> No, honestly,<br> there's nothing you can do.<br> We'll see how things go<br> when she's back here in the apartment.<br> We'll manage all right.<br> Maybe I'll hire a home health aide,<br> maybe I'll manage on my own.<br> We'll see.<br> We've been through a lot together,<br> your mother and I.<br> All this is still a bit new.<br> It's funny. I don't know if I should<br> tell you as it might embarrass you<br> but when I came in earlier<br> I remembered how I always used to listen<br> to the two of you making love as a child.<br> This always reassured me.<br> It gave me a feeling<br> that you loved each other<br> and that we'd always be together.<br> - Watch your fingers!<br> - Yeah.<br> Put this next to the window.<br> Thank you.<br> Certainly, sir.<br> Sorry.<br> - This is for both of you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Thank you, Mr. Mry.<br> If you need anything,<br> just call downstairs.<br> - If we can help you in one way or another...<br> - Right now everything's fine.<br> I'll let your wife know<br> as soon as we need anything.<br> Good to have you back,<br> Mrs. Laurent.<br> Yes, thank you, Mr. Mry.<br> Thank you.<br> If... If you need anything...<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Goodbye then, ma'am.<br> Welcome home again.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Mry, thank you.<br> Where do you want...<br> In the living room.<br> Shall I make some tea?<br> First come sit with me.<br> - Can you help me into the arm chair?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Come closer.<br> Put your knees against mine<br> so I don't slip.<br> Put your right arm around me.<br> And lift me up.<br> And up!<br> Here.<br> I'm so glad you're back.<br> So am I.<br> - Promise me one thing.<br> - What?<br> Please never take me back<br> to the hospital.<br> What?<br> You promise?<br> - Anne...<br> - You promise?<br> - Anne, I'm...<br> - Don't talk right now.<br> Don't give me any lectures.<br> Please.<br> - What can I say?<br> - Nothing.<br> Just don't say anything.<br> Okay?<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> - Everything fine?<br> - Everything is fine.<br> You don't have to hold my hand<br> all the time.<br> I can look after myself,<br> you know.<br> And don't feel guilty.<br> That would be pointless.<br> And a drag for me too.<br> - I don't feel guilty.<br> - That's good.<br> Go over there now.<br> I'm not a cripple.<br> You can easily leave me alone<br> for two minutes. I won't collapse.<br> Okay.<br> Did you buy the new book<br> on Harnoncourt?<br> - I've already read it.<br> - And?<br> Do you want it?<br> Shall I get it for you?<br> Please do.<br> I don't know where I put it.<br> - Don't worry. It's not that important.<br> - Yes it is.<br> I think I left it...<br> Ah, here it is!<br> Nothing like an infallible memory!<br> I thought I had left it<br> in the small bedroom<br> but I had already put it away.<br> Tidy people just can't help being tidy.<br> Thank you.<br> Good, now do something for yourself.<br> Don't stay here to see<br> how I hold the book, okay?<br> Okay.<br> I'll leave the door open.<br> Unfortunately the strawberries<br> were already moldy.<br> I'll go and get you some fresh ones<br> tomorrow morning from the market.<br> My husband will bring you<br> the Evian water this afternoon.<br> I'm not supposed to carry anything<br> heavy. My back, you know.<br> No problem.<br> It came to 76.40.<br> Here's the receipt.<br> - Your change, 23.60.<br> - Keep the small change.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Well, I'll be going then.<br> Call me if you need anything.<br> I will.<br> - Is your wife doing well?<br> - Yes. She's recovering.<br> That's good.<br> Give her my regards.<br> My husband and I are very glad<br> she's back.<br> Yes, we are too.<br> Goodbye, Mrs. Mry, thank you.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> I'll bring you the strawberries<br> tomorrow around noon, if that suits you.<br> Yes, fine.<br> Thank you.<br> - Can you come here, please.<br> - Yes.<br> Some banal love story about a nobleman<br> and a lower middle class girl<br> who can't marry<br> and who then, out of sheer magnanimity,<br> renounce their love for each other.<br> In fact, I don't remember the story.<br> In any case, I remember that I was<br> completely shaken up when I went out<br> and that I needed some time<br> to calm down.<br> Thank you.<br> In the courtyard of the house<br> where grandma lived,<br> there was a young guy at the window<br> who asked me where I'd been.<br> He was a few years older than me.<br> He was a show-off<br> who of course really impressed me.<br> "To the cinema", I said to him.<br> Because I was very proud grandma had given<br> me money to go all alone to the cinema.<br> "What did you watch?"<br> I started to tell him the story<br> and as I did,<br> all the emotion came back.<br> I didn't want to cry in front of this<br> guy, but it was impossible.<br> There I was, in tears in the courtyard,<br> and I told him the drama till the end.<br> So? How did he react?<br> No idea.<br> He probably laughed at me.<br> I don't remember.<br> I don't remember the film either.<br> But I remember the feelings.<br> I was ashamed to cry.<br> But telling him the story made<br> all my feelings and tears come back,<br> maybe even stronger than<br> when I was actually watching the film.<br> I just couldn't stop.<br> That's sweet.<br> Why have you never told me this?<br> There are still many stories<br> I've never told you.<br> Don't tell me you're going to ruin<br> your image in your old age?<br> You bet I won't.<br> But what is my image?<br> Sometimes you're a monster.<br> But you're nice.<br> Can I get you another drink?<br> Five.<br> Six.<br> Seven.<br> Eight.<br> Nine.<br> Ten.<br> Up to fifteen.<br> Eleven.<br> Twelve.<br> Thirteen.<br> Fourteen.<br> And fifteen.<br> - You're okay?<br> - I'm okay.<br> Listen to this.<br> My horoscope.<br> Motto: You have lots of verve,<br> but need to be more serious!<br> Love: High-class conversation<br> is what you need.<br> Work: You're motivated again.<br> But proceed with care.<br> Health: Loosen up by doing exercises.<br> It'll give you renewed pizazz.<br> You've got only yourself to blame<br> if you read this nonsense.<br> Tomorrow afternoon<br> is Pierre's funeral.<br> You've got to go.<br> I fear I must.<br> Though I don't want to go at all.<br> Few people like to go to funerals.<br> Oh, I know a few people who do.<br> Annette, for instance,<br> cannot wait to get all dressed up.<br> - And Franois, this idiot...<br> - You're mean.<br> What would you say<br> if no one came to your funeral?<br> Nothing, presumably.<br> Have you talked to Jeanne<br> since I went to the hospital?<br> Does she knows I can't come?<br> Yes.<br> Of course.<br> What did she say?<br> - She was in shock.<br> - In what way?<br> I don't know. What are people like<br> when they're shocked?<br> She was speechless,<br> she couldn't believe it.<br> I don't know, well, not precisely.<br> You know I've spoken<br> to a lot of people since.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No.<br> Please forgive me.<br> I didn't mean to be unkind.<br> But what's the point<br> of talking about it all the time.<br> Do I talk about it all the time?<br> No.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What...<br> Why are you back already?<br> What time is it?<br> Forgive me, I was too slow.<br> - Anne...<br> - Can you wheel me into the living room?<br> Yes.<br> You're always good at surprises.<br> Yes.<br> Why did you come home earlier?<br> I didn't come home earlier.<br> I took a taxi.<br> On Saturdays<br> there's not a lot of traffic.<br> That's true.<br> How was the funeral?<br> Anne...<br> How was it?<br> Come on, tell me!<br> It was rather bizarre.<br> The priest was an idiot.<br> A former colleague of Pierre's<br> came to make a speech<br> that was embarrassingly emotional.<br> His former secretary<br> came with a mini cassette player<br> and put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles.<br> You can't imagine.<br> Everybody turned round<br> to look at her.<br> Obviously, it was not planned.<br> Pierre's grandchildren were there.<br> Of course, they giggled<br> as soon as the music began.<br> Then<br> the urn was put on a huge stretcher<br> that was obviously<br> designed for a coffin,<br> and we went out into the rain.<br> They placed the urn<br> on a small electric cart<br> that crawled along<br> for what seemed like an eternity<br> to the small hole<br> that they had dug.<br> Many people got the giggles.<br> It must have been terrible for Jeanne.<br> There's no point in going on living.<br> That's how it is.<br> I know it can only get worse.<br> Why should I inflict this on us,<br> on you and me?<br> You're not inflicting anything on me.<br> You don't have to lie, Georges.<br> Put yourself in my place.<br> Didn't you ever think<br> that it could happen to me too?<br> Of course, I did.<br> But imagination and reality<br> have little in common.<br> - But things are getting better every day.<br> - I don't want to carry on.<br> You're making such sweet efforts<br> to make everything easier for me.<br> But I don't want to go on.<br> For my own sake.<br> Not yours.<br> I don't believe you.<br> I know you.<br> You think you are a burden to me.<br> But what would you do<br> in my place?<br> I don't want to rack my brain<br> over this.<br> I'm tired, I want to go to bed.<br> Hello.<br> Nice to see you.<br> I'm sorry to descend upon you like this.<br> I tried many times to call you<br> but to no avail.<br> I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone<br> when I've stored the caller's number<br> and I know who's calling.<br> But come on in.<br> I was so sorry that I couldn't manage<br> to come by after the concert.<br> I was so pleased that you came.<br> Come with me.<br> Yesterday my agent called me.<br> Actually I'm going to record<br> an album in June<br> and I had to pick a location,<br> a piano.<br> So I flew into Paris this morning,<br> and once I was at my hotel, I thought,<br> I'll just give it a try and drop in.<br> It's just around the corner.<br> Very nice.<br> - This is for your spouse.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Isn't she home?<br> - Yes she is. I'll get her in a minute.<br> - Have a seat, please.<br> - I hope I'm not disturbing you.<br> No, not at all. I'm very happy<br> to see you. Have a seat.<br> We were so thrilled by your concert,<br> my wife and I.<br> We hoped we'd see you again soon.<br> Can I can get you something?<br> - A cup of tea?<br> - No, thank you.<br> I'll just put the flowers in a vase<br> and tell her that you are here.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Alexandre, I'm delighted.<br> How lovely to see you!<br> Mrs. Laurent!<br> Lovely to see you too.<br> Don't get up.<br> Come on, sit down.<br> And don't look so serious.<br> I'm really proud of you.<br> We were both in raptures<br> after your concert.<br> Georges wanted to buy your new CD<br> the very next morning.<br> Oh my God! I wanted to bring you one<br> but then I completely forgot about it.<br> I left in such a hurry.<br> - I'll get one today and drop it by.<br> - No, no, don't worry.<br> We want to contribute to your success,<br> even it's only 20 euro.<br> You have already contributed a lot.<br> I owe you so much, ma'am.<br> You owe it to your hard work<br> and your talent.<br> Do you remember, when you first gave me<br> the "Bagatelles" to play?<br> I was 12 years old.<br> And in my youthful arrogance<br> I asked you: "But why the 'Bagatelles'?"<br> Don't you remember? That day, you really<br> gave me a piece of your mind.<br> What has happened to you?<br> My right side is paralyzed, that's all.<br> This can happen when you get older.<br> And how...<br> Let's talk about something else,<br> if you don't mind.<br> Yes.<br> Don't be offended.<br> But I want to enjoy the lovely interlude<br> you've given us with your visit.<br> Yes, of course.<br> You haven't told us yet<br> what's been going on<br> since the Paris concert.<br> Well, I was in London<br> most of the time.<br> I performed two concerts in Copenhagen,<br> that was Schubert too.<br> The "Impromptu", the "Musical Moments".<br> My whole life revolves<br> around Schubert at the moment.<br> Ideally, I would like to record<br> the complete collection of sonatas.<br> Though I think I still need<br> a couple more years for the late ones.<br> - Could you do me a favor?<br> - What?<br> Would play the<br> "Bagatelle in G Minor" for me?<br> I haven't played it in a while.<br> I don't remember it very well.<br> - If you want, I can give it a try.<br> - Give it a try.<br> Okay.<br> What's the matter?<br> What are you doing?<br> Have you completely lost your mind?<br> I can't believe it.<br> See what you have done.<br> Can't you call me<br> if you need something?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Yeah, I am too.<br> Sorry.<br> The lamp is broken, too.<br> Yes?<br> Who's there?<br> Anybody here?<br> Is there anybody here?<br> Georges, what's the matter?<br> What's going on?<br> Calm down, will you.<br> What was it?<br> Eva. They're coming on the 12th.<br> Why?<br> No idea.<br> Apparently, she's coming with Geoff.<br> When is it?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> What day is it today?<br> I'll go and look.<br> I don't want that.<br> What?<br> Geoff doesn't need to come.<br> It's not necessary.<br> I don't need any comments<br> on my predicament.<br> I can only take his British humor<br> in small doses.<br> Dear Mrs. Laurent<br> and Mr. Laurent.<br> It was beautiful<br> and yet sad to see you.<br> My heartfelt wishes<br> that things will get better.<br> With deepest sympathy,<br> your former pupil, Alexandre.<br> Stop the CD.<br> Where are the photo albums?<br> The photo albums?<br> I don't know.<br> In the small bedroom, I think.<br> Why?<br> Can you get them for me?<br> Now?<br> But why now?<br> I'd like to look at them.<br> Please.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> It's beautiful.<br> What?<br> Life.<br> So long.<br> Long life.<br> Stop watching me.<br> I wasn't watching you.<br> Of course you were.<br> I'm not that dumb yet.<br> ... the focus will be as much<br> on the how as on the what.<br> Benjamin Netanyahu,<br> is finally granted an official visit<br> with all the honours:<br> handshake photo,<br> joint press conference,<br> conspicuously demonstrating<br> the renewal of ties between Israel...<br> handshake photo,<br> joint press conference,<br> conspicuously demonstrating<br> the renewal of ties between Israel...<br> Israel and the United States.<br> You're soaked through.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Hang on.<br> It's no big deal.<br> Come on.<br> Wait.<br> Don't get all worked up.<br> Calm down, calm down.<br> ... thinking about<br> whether it wouldn't be better<br> to invest the money<br> in an apartment block.<br> If inflation gets going again,<br> property is the only sure thing.<br> Right now,<br> savings accounts pay 1.75% at best.<br> That's a good rate already.<br> Four years ago, Geoff bought<br> shares for a small amount of money,<br> and the whole thing collapsed.<br> So now we're obviously worried.<br> In the meantime,<br> other people have had the same idea<br> and property prices are soaring.<br> Since I came back from Scandinavia,<br> I spend my spare time<br> going through the classifieds.<br> We'll see.<br> It takes time.<br> We'll find something in the end.<br> I have...<br> the grandmother...<br> woman with house...<br> not...<br> house then...<br> money...<br> I'm... Sorry, Mum,<br> I don't understand you.<br> I don't understand<br> what you say.<br> yes...<br> straight away...<br> it's all...<br> house sel...<br> sel...<br> not...<br> in two strokes...<br> so quickly...<br> God...<br> it's hard...<br> say...<br> house sol...<br> money gone...<br> gone...<br> al...so the... the... the... the... hou...se<br> Yes.<br> Whose house?<br> The house of...<br> also... grandmother...<br> grandmother...<br> Three times a week.<br> I'm not experienced enough.<br> We'll see if that's enough.<br> How much is she asking?<br> It's paid by the hour.<br> We'll see.<br> And her?<br> Anne?<br> It's hard to say.<br> Sometimes I get the feeling she's<br> totally unaware of the state she's in.<br> But in the next moment<br> I feel the opposite.<br> And what does the doctor say?<br> He...<br> She only talks gibberish.<br> What's going on?<br> We can't just leave her lying<br> on her bed like that!<br> She's unrecognizable!<br> It's ridiculous!<br> There's nothing we can do<br> at the moment.<br> She's undergoing treatment,<br> gets medication.<br> There are no other options<br> right now.<br> What does that mean, "no other options"?<br> Why not put her in the hospital?<br> She had a second stroke.<br> Bertier examined her<br> and felt we could spare her<br> all the hospital inpatient procedures.<br> Anyway, they wouldn't keep her.<br> They'd send her to a care home<br> with nursing.<br> What they do in those places,<br> we can do here.<br> And she won't be put in a care home.<br> I promised her that.<br> Don't you think<br> you're taking on too much?<br> Have you got a better idea?<br> I can't believe that these days<br> there is not a more effective treatment.<br> No one's stopping you<br> from finding out.<br> I take it you believe me when I say<br> I love your mother as much as you do.<br> So please, don't treat me<br> as if I was a total idiot<br> incapable of doing the obvious.<br> I didn't say that.<br> I'm simply questioning whether what I<br> see going on here is the best solution.<br> Don't you want to get<br> a second opinion?<br> Stop it, both of you.<br> Another doctor did come.<br> He agrees with Bertier.<br> From Monday, a nurse will come<br> three times a week.<br> Is that good enough?<br> Now can we talk<br> about something else?<br> Like what?<br> a republican awakening by a president<br> who has secluded himself<br> in the lyse Palace for the weekend.<br> He's cancelled everything,<br> doors are closed, his schedule is empty.<br> All that's on his mind right now is to<br> prepare his appearance on France 2.<br> This appearance will be in the form of<br> an interview conducted by David Pujadas<br> because his previous interview in January<br> was conducted by TF1's Laurence Ferrari.<br> France Inter will broadcast a special<br> programme tomorrow between 9 and 10 p.m.<br> where we'll analyse<br> and comment the interview<br> ... and behind the shoulder. You turn.<br> And behind the buttocks.<br> Hold like this, with the elbow.<br> And we put the nappy on.<br> Straighten your back.<br> Straighten it.<br> Then gently roll back,<br> straighten your leg.<br> Could you grab the sheet down there?<br> I'll help you.<br> Pull, pull, pull, pull.<br> Now you pull the diaper.<br> Like this.<br> That's it.<br> And we lie down on the back.<br> And you put the nappy on<br> and fasten the tapes.<br> There, my love,<br> I hope you like it.<br> Yes, yes.<br> I added some peach juice.<br> I find it tastes quite good.<br> Come on, Anne, my love,<br> you've only swallowed three mouthfuls.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Mum to the concert...<br> Yes?<br> Mum to the concert...<br> No... no dress...<br> No dress, mum to the concert.<br> Mum to the concert...<br> No!<br> I'll also wash the other one.<br> That's it.<br> Now we only wash off the soap.<br> Does the temperature suit you?<br> No? I'm bending you forward.<br> Don't be afraid, I'm here.<br> Very well.<br> ... come from 8 till 12<br> and I'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7.<br> I'll think about it.<br> She just has to know in time<br> so she can plan ahead.<br> Of course. I'll let you know<br> in the next few days.<br> Very well.<br> I have to go now.<br> - Thanks for the coffee.<br> - My pleasure.<br> I'll see you out.<br> You mustn't take it too seriously.<br> Usually they always say something.<br> She might just as well say<br> "Mum, Mum, Mum".<br> - It's just mechanical.<br> - I know.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> - Goodbye.<br> I'd like to hire a second nurse.<br> The two could take turns.<br> That would make everything<br> a bit simpler, wouldn't it?<br> What do you think?<br> Hurts.<br> Hurts.<br> Hurts.<br> Hurts.<br> - Please leave them in the kitchen.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm back!<br> Thank you.<br> Is there anything else<br> I can do for you?<br> No, thank you.<br> You've been a big help, Mr. Mry.<br> It's nothing, sir.<br> Thanks a lot, sir.<br> I'll let you know<br> if I need you again.<br> With pleasure, sir.<br> Goodbye.<br> - May I say something, sir?<br> - Yes?<br> My wife and I, we are very impressed<br> by your handling of the situation.<br> I take my hat off to you.<br> That's very kind of you.<br> Thank you.<br> Until next time.<br> - Give my regards to your wife.<br> - I certainly will.<br> Hello Eva.<br> How are you?<br> Things are fine.<br> On...<br> the...<br> b...<br> On the bridge...<br> bridge of A...<br> of Avignon...<br> On the bridge of Avignon...<br> the... the...<br> - Come on, Anne.<br> - The bridge!<br> of Avignon...<br> vi...vi...vignon...gnon<br> On the bridge of Avignon<br> we all dance there,<br> we all dance there<br> - Dance!<br> - On the bridge of Avignon...<br> - Dance!<br> - We all dance...<br> - all... all...<br> - On the bridge of Avignon<br> we all dance there,<br> we all dance there<br> On the bridge of Avignon<br> we all dance there in a ring<br> On the bridge...<br> dance... dance...<br> all... all...<br> There we are.<br> Now you're all beautiful again.<br> So everyone will admire you.<br> That's it.<br> You want to see?<br> Wait.<br> Well?<br> Aren't we a pretty sight?<br> Shoo!<br> Shoo!<br> Shoo!<br> As you wish, sir.<br> I don't know<br> what you were expecting, but..<br> I gave up another job<br> to come and work here.<br> You should've thought it over before<br> if you'll need a second nurse or not.<br> I didn't know then<br> how incompetent you are.<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> I don't want to discuss it with you.<br> Anyway, you wouldn't understand.<br> No one has ever reprimanded me.<br> Good for you.<br> How much do I owe you?<br> I've never had anything like this<br> happen to me before.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> I've been doing this job for years.<br> I don't need you<br> to teach me how to do it.<br> Do you have 20 euro?<br> - No.<br> - Then take the 800 and go.<br> You're a wicked old man.<br> I feel sorry for you.<br> I hope from the bottom of my heart<br> that one day someone treats you<br> the same way you treat your patients,<br> and that you too will have no way<br> of defending yourself.<br> Now get out.<br> Get out of here.<br> Go fuck yourself, you old fart!<br> Open your mouth, Anne.<br> Come on, open your mouth.<br> Anne! Please.<br> Come on.<br> Please.<br> Stop it.<br> If you don't drink, you'll die.<br> Is that what you want?<br> Come on.<br> Please.<br> Christ almighty.<br> You can't force me<br> to let you die of thirst.<br> If you persist, I'll call Bertier<br> and he'll put you in hospital.<br> They can force-feed you there.<br> Is that what you want?<br> I promised to spare you that<br> but you must help me.<br> I'm out of my depth.<br> Come on, Anne.<br> Drink this, now!<br> That's it.<br> Good.<br> Well, swallow it!<br> Please, forgive me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Who's there?<br> - It's me.<br> - Eva?<br> - Yes.<br> Just a minute.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> What was going on?<br> Nothing.<br> I was in the toilet.<br> No, come in.<br> - Why this unannounced visit?<br> - What's going on with mum?<br> Nothing.<br> What should be going on?<br> Don't you want to sit down first?<br> Why are you in Paris?<br> What's going on with mum?<br> Why don't you answer the phone?<br> Since our last conversation, I left<br> four messages on your answering machine.<br> Why don't you call back?<br> Sorry. I didn't listen to it.<br> Forgive me.<br> Don't you realize we're worried?<br> Your worries are no use to me.<br> No, don't get me wrong.<br> I'm not criticizing you.<br> I just don't have the time<br> to deal with your worries, that's all.<br> - Dad...<br> - No, let's stop this conversation.<br> Your mother is just as could have been<br> expected: bad the whole time.<br> She is turning more and more<br> into a helpless child.<br> It's sad and humiliating<br> for her and for me.<br> And she doesn't want<br> to be seen in that state.<br> Even the last time<br> she did not want you to come.<br> You two have your own life.<br> Nothing wrong with that.<br> But let us have our life too.<br> Okay?<br> Dad, what's the matter?<br> Nothing.<br> Your visit caught me by surprise.<br> And I'm annoyed that you show up here<br> to check that everything's okay.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> Stay here, please.<br> Please!<br> Mum?<br> Mum!<br> Tell me, what's going on?<br> Have you gone crazy?<br> Sit down.<br> I don't want to sit down.<br> What's going on here?<br> Nothing's going on. I want to spare<br> us all a pointless drama.<br> I presume your mother is asleep.<br> She sleeps all day.<br> And then she wakes up at night.<br> If you really want to,<br> we'll go and see her in a little while.<br> Now, sit down.<br> We do our speech exercises every day,<br> or we sing together.<br> Usually I wake up around 5.<br> At that time, she's still awake.<br> We change the nappy,<br> I rub cream on her to avoid bed sores.<br> Then, around 7, I try to persuade her<br> to eat and drink.<br> Sometimes it works, sometimes not.<br> Sometimes she tells me things<br> from her childhood.<br> Or calls for help for hours.<br> Then, suddenly, she starts giggling.<br> Or crying.<br> Nothing of any of that<br> is worth showing.<br> You can't forbid me<br> from seeing her.<br> No.<br> It's me, Mum.<br> Can I do something for you?<br> Mum.<br> Mum.<br> Mum.<br> Mum.<br> The tea isn't very hot any more.<br> But it does make you feel better.<br> Thanks.<br> It was silly of me<br> to lock the door.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You took me by surprise.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What's going to happen now?<br> What's going to happen now?<br> The nurse comes<br> three times a week.<br> Every two weeks Dr. Bertier<br> and the hairdresser come.<br> That's what you wanted to know?<br> No?<br> Things will go on<br> as they have done up until now.<br> They'll go from bad to worse.<br> Things will go on,<br> and then one day it will all be over.<br> You can't go on like this, Dad.<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> What do you suggest?<br> Can't we have a serious talk,<br> you and me?<br> What do you call "a serious talk"?<br> Do you want to have Mom live with you?<br> Do you want to pack her off<br> to a care home?<br> Is this what you want?<br> Go on, talk to me seriously!<br> All long...<br> Ding dong...<br> Yes, it swung to and fro.<br> Yes, yes, to, fro.<br> You...<br> Very serious...<br> Like that.<br> Yes.<br> Like that.<br> Serious.<br> Yes, I was very uptight.<br> Yes.<br> Up...tight.<br> It... was... nice.<br> Hurts.<br> Hurts.<br> Hurts.<br> What's the matter.<br> Where do you hurt?<br> What's going on?<br> Is it the nappy?<br> Is it full?<br> Where do you hurt?<br> It's all right, it's all right.<br> I'm here.<br> Everything's fine.<br> We will...<br> Do you want me<br> to tell you a story?<br> But you must be quiet,<br> I can't talk too loud.<br> It wears me out.<br> When I was little,<br> well, I wasn't as little as all that,<br> I think it was<br> toward the end of primary school,<br> so I was about 10.<br> Dad and mum had sent me<br> to a holiday camp.<br> They thought it would do me good to<br> spend the summer with kids my own age.<br> We were lodged in an old castle<br> in the midst of the forest.<br> I think it was in the Auvergne.<br> I don't remember.<br> In any case it was the opposite<br> of what I'd expected.<br> We had to get up at 6 in the morning<br> and plunge into a lake.<br> It was a small lake<br> not far from the castle.<br> It was fed by an icy mountain stream.<br> We had to enter it running,<br> in a double file.<br> You know,<br> I was never very sporty.<br> They had worked out a programme<br> to keep us on the go all day,<br> Probably to nip in... in the bud<br> any potential pubescent impulses.<br> But the worst thing was the food.<br> The third day after our arrival,<br> there was rice pudding for lunch.<br> I hate rice pudding.<br> We sat at long tables in a huge hall.<br> I didn't want to eat the stuff.<br> One of the monitors said to me:<br> "If you don't clear your plate,<br> you won't get out of here."<br> So after the meal everybody left,<br> and I remained alone, in tears.<br> I had made a secret pact with mum.<br> I was to write to her every week.<br> I was to send her a postcard.<br> If I liked the stay,<br> I was to draw flowers,<br> if not, stars.<br> She kept the card.<br> It was covered all over in stars.<br> After three hours,<br> I was finally allowed to get out.<br> I went up to my room,<br> got into bed<br> I had a fever of over 40 degrees.<br> It was diphtheria.<br> I was taken<br> to the nearest hospital<br> and sent to quarantine.<br> Which meant that mum,<br> when she came to visit me,<br> could only wave at me<br> through a window.<br> At some point I lost that postcard.<br> It's a pity.<br> ... you won't believe it.<br> A pigeon came in,<br> for the second time already,<br> through the light well.<br> This time I caught it.<br> In fact it wasn't difficult at all.<br> But I set it free again.<br> I'm almost done.<br> You can put your shoes on if you want.<br> Thank you.<br> Aren't you taking a coat?<br>
