                        AN EDUCATION<br> Come on, girls.<br> Anybody?<br> Anybody else?<br> Jenny. Again.<br> Isn't it because Mr Rochester's blind?<br> Yes, Jenny.<br> I've got an English essay to do<br> by tomorrow morning.<br> Right.<br> So the only sound I want to hear<br> coming through the ceiling...<br> ...is the sound of sweat dripping<br> onto textbooks.<br> - Cello?<br> - No. No cello.<br> I thought we agreed that<br> cello was my interest or hobby?<br> But it's already is your interest<br> or hobby.<br> So when they ask you<br> at the Oxford interview...<br> "What is your interest or hobby?"<br> ...you can say, "the Cello".<br> And you won't be lying.<br> Look, you don't have to<br> practise a hobby.<br> A hobby is a hobby.<br> Can I stop going to the youth<br> orchestra, then?<br> No!<br> No. No. The youth orchestra<br> is a good thing.<br> - That shows you're a joiner-inner.<br> - Yes.<br> But, I've already joined in.<br> So now I can stop.<br> No!<br> No. Well, that just shows the opposite,<br> don't you see?<br> No, that shows you're a rebel.<br> They don't want that at Oxford.<br> No. They don't want people<br> who think for themselves.<br> No, of course they don't.<br> Jenny.<br> Should I wear like,<br> Sunday best?<br> You'd better, I'm afraid.<br> Just to show my father<br> you're a serious young man...<br> ...not a teddy boy.<br> Oh, God!<br> I need to go.<br> It'll bucket down in a minute.<br> - Alright...<br> - I'll see you at the weekend.<br> - Bye, then.<br> - Bye.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Sorry.<br> Goodbye, my love.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Stop it, now! Stop it!<br> Oh no, look what you've done.<br> - The nice man is waiting for us.<br> - It fell off.<br> Hello.<br> Look...<br> If you had any sense, you wouldn't<br> take a lift from a strange man.<br> But I'm a music lover, and I'm<br> worried about your cello. So...<br> ...what I propose is, you put it<br> in my car and walk alongside me.<br> How do I know you won't just<br> drive off with the cello?<br> Good point.<br> How much does a new cello cost?<br> Ten? Fifteen pounds?<br> I don't know.<br> Let's say... fifteen.<br> No? Alright.<br> Up to you.<br> And that.<br> I'm David, by the way.<br> - Jenny.<br> - Very good.<br> How did the concert go?<br> It was a rehearsal.<br> The concert's next Thursday.<br> - What are you playing?<br> - Elgar.<br> I think it's a shame he spent<br> so much time in Worcester, don't you?<br> Worcester's too near Birmingham.<br> And you can hear that in the music.<br> There's a terrible Brummy accent in there,<br> if you listen hard enough.<br> Anyway, Elgar and the Jews<br> don't mix very well.<br> I'm not a Jew!<br> - No. I am.<br> - Oh!<br> I wasn't accusing you.<br> Can I sit in the car<br> with my cello?<br> Jump in.<br> I've never seen a<br> car like this before.<br> - It's very chic.<br> - It's a Bristol.<br> Not many of them made.<br> Where to, madam?<br> Jenny live round the corner.<br> - Worst luck!<br> - I'll see what I can do.<br> I suppose cellists must go to a<br> lot of concerts.<br> We don't go to any concerts.<br> - We don't believe in them.<br> - Oh, they're real.<br> So people say.<br> - Smoke?<br> - I'd better not.<br> I live just up there.<br> Why don't we believe in them?<br> He'd say there's no point in them.<br> - Your father, this is?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> They're just for fun.<br> Apart from school concerts,<br> which are no fun at all,<br> ...so we go to those.<br> They don't help you get on.<br> Which of course is what is so<br> wonderful about them.<br> Anyway, you'll go one day.<br> I know. I will.<br> If I get to University...<br> I'm going to read what I want...<br> ...and listen to what I want.<br> And I'm going to look at paintings<br> and watch French films...<br> ...and I'm gonna talk to people<br> who know lots about lots.<br> - Good for you.<br> - Yes.<br> - Which University?<br> - Oxford. If I'm lucky.<br> Did you go anywhere?<br> I studied at what I believe they<br> call the University of Life.<br> I didn't get a very good degree there.<br> Well, thank you for driving me home.<br> - You alright? You got it?<br> - Yes, it's fine.<br> - Thank you.<br> - My pleasure.<br> bSous le ciel de Paris<br> performed by Juliette Greco/b<br> I don't want to hear<br> any French singing.<br> French singing wasn't on the syllabus,<br> last time I looked.<br> - Battenberg?<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> So where are you applying, Graham?<br> I'm not sure yet.<br> When will you be sure?<br> You can't let the grass grow<br> under your feet, young man.<br> - I might take a year off.<br> - What for?<br> I don't know yet.<br> Maybe do some travelling, yeah,<br> that sort of thing.<br> Travelling?<br> What are you, a teddy boy?<br> You know she's going to Oxford,<br> don't you?<br> If we can get her Latin<br> up to scratch.<br> So while she's studying<br> English at Oxford...<br> ...you'll be the wandering Jew.<br> Mr Mellor, I'm not a teddy boy.<br> I'm... I'm a, uh,<br> serious man. Young.<br> No... yeah.<br> A young man serious...<br> man.<br> - They're for me!<br> - Who are they from?<br> - Gosh! Him.<br> - What's this?<br> Jack, I'm afraid Jenny's been<br> sent some flowers from a chap.<br> - A chap? What kind of chap?<br> - He's wishing me luck for tonight.<br> Are you sure that's all<br> he's wishing you?<br> Where did he get the money from?<br> - He earns it, I expect.<br> - Earns it? Why isn't he in school?<br> I don't... can we just go?<br> Otherwise the good-luck flowers will<br> actually be responsible for me...<br> ...actually missing the concert.<br> Which would be ironic, isn't it?<br> - I... I don't like it<br> - Objection noted.<br> - Jenny?<br> - Noted.<br> Yeah, well... it's gotta be ten bob's<br> worth of luck here, I mean...<br> That's a bit much<br> for a schoolgirl, isn't it?<br> Oh, we can't leave it here.<br> I mean, I'd burgle a house<br> with flowers left outside.<br> They'll think we're made of money.<br> Thank you, Marjorie.<br> Camus doesn't want you to like him.<br> Feeling is bourgeois.<br> Being engagee is bourgeois.<br> He kills someone<br> and he doesn't feel anything.<br> His mother dies<br> and he doesn't feel anything.<br> I wouldn't feel anything<br> if my mother dies.<br> Does that make me an<br> existentialist?<br> No. That just makes you a cow.<br> A cow.<br> Well...<br> After I've been to the university...<br> I'm going to be French.<br> And I'm going to Paris...<br> ...and I'm going to smoke and wear black<br> and listen to Jacques Brel.<br> And I won't speak. Ever.<br> - Oh, cranky!<br> - What?<br> Wait, here.<br> Hello?<br> Hello!<br> Hello. Thank you.<br> How did it go?<br> Fine. I think.<br> Well, I didn't mess my bit up.<br> Nobody got thrown out<br> of the orchestra afterwards.<br> Always the mark of a cultural triumph.<br> Listen. I'm glad I ran into you.<br> What are you doing on Friday?<br> - Going to school.<br> - I meant the evening.<br> Oh, of course. Nothing.<br> Because I'm going to listen to<br> some Ravel in St. John's Smith Square.<br> My friends Danny and Helen<br> would be coming too,<br> ...so it wouldn't be, uh...<br> I tell you what.<br> I'll come and pick you up...<br> ...and if your mother and<br> father disapprove,<br> ...then you can have the tickets<br> and go with one of them.<br> - How does that sound?<br> - Thank you.<br> And I'd like to go with you.<br> Seven?<br> Okay, fine.<br> And probably go for<br> a spot of supper afterwards.<br> - Supper?<br> - Hm, if you want to.<br> Well, the thing is that...<br> we probably would have eaten.<br> Well, if you'd like supper,<br> then perhaps on friday...<br> ...you could, uh, not eat?<br> Yes. Of course.<br> A spot of supper?<br> - You've heard of supper?<br> We've heard of it.<br> But we've never eaten it.<br> So, you're gonna have to<br> tell us everything.<br> Otherwise, it's not fair.<br> I won't allow it!<br> - Fine.<br> He's more than happy<br> for you to take me.<br> Fine. I will.<br> - Good.<br> - Well, where is it?<br> - St. John's Smith Square.<br> - Where's that?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm sure we could find out.<br> It's in Westminster.<br> Right next to the Abbey.<br> How did you know that?<br> I had a life before we were<br> married, you know?<br> - He soon put a stop to that.<br> - Well, there we are.<br> - Where are we?<br> - We're near Westminster Abbey.<br> I'm not going all the way over there.<br> The trouble is, that's where<br> St. John's Smith Square is.<br> There must be something on locally.<br> Where's the paper?<br> She wants to see someone<br> who can play.<br> She doesn't want to see<br> Sheila Kirkland scratching away.<br> I'll take her.<br> And how do you propose to get there?<br> RAF helicopter?<br> - That's him.<br> - Oh, bloody hell.<br> Jack!<br> By the way, David's a Jew.<br> A wandering Jew.<br> So watch yourself.<br> What did she mean by that?<br> I've never said anything like that!<br> It's just an expression!<br> Look, I got nothing against the Jews...<br> I'm glad to hear it.<br> Hello.<br> No, I didn't mean that<br> I got against you..<br> - No, of course I do mean that.<br> - Dad!<br> No, it's that... sorry,<br> it's just that...<br> You're not the sort of person<br> that I'd be against,<br> But I wouldn't because...<br> I'm not the kind of person<br> who would be against...<br> ...people.<br> I'm Jack, and<br> this is my wife Marjorie.<br> You didn't tell me<br> you had a sister, Jenny.<br> Please.<br> You're a lucky man, Jack.<br> Yes, I suppose I'm.<br> This is lovely.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> David, would you like a drink?<br> I'd love one, Jack,<br> but we're running a little late.<br> If Jenny's ready,<br> perhaps we'll shoot off.<br> Actually, David, Dad has something<br> he has to tell you.<br> No, no, really...<br> It... It was just a question.<br> Point of reference.<br> What's the best way to get to<br> St. John's Smith square from here?<br> It's a pretty straight run, really.<br> Up to Hammersmith, take the A4<br> through Kensington and you're there.<br> - Simple as that?<br> - Simple as that.<br> - Shall I book us some tickets?<br> - No.<br> But... have her back by ten, David.<br> I was hoping she might come<br> with me afterwards...<br> ...for a spot of supper<br> with my aunt Helen.<br> Oh, well...<br> No... no, no.<br> She's usually in bed by then.<br> What if I promise to have<br> her back by eleven thirty?<br> Well, it's Friday night.<br> And you're going all the way<br> to the West End...<br> Thanks, Jack.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Alright.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Have a nice time.<br> Hello. Hello.<br> Are we late?<br> No, I thought we're going to<br> miss the beginning,<br> ...and then it wouldn't be<br> worth going in,<br> ...and we could go off dancing<br> or something.<br> Helen is one of the more reluctant<br> members of tonight's audience.<br> Hello.<br> Jenny, these are my friends<br> Helen and Danny.<br> Shall we?<br> Fine.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - That's alright. It's nice, isn't it?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - Where did you get it from?<br> - Oh, in Chelsea somewhere.<br> Oh, yours is...<br> Well, it's good for<br> this sort of concert, isn't it?<br> Thank you.<br> We should go shopping together<br> one day, you and I, if you want.<br> That would be nice.<br> But Chelsea... C'est beaucoup<br> trop cher pour moi.<br> Sorry?<br> I just said, um,<br> it's too expensive for me.<br> No, you didn't.<br> You said something<br> completely different.<br> No, well...<br> I said it in French.<br> In French? Why?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, Chelsea is too expensive<br> for me too, really.<br> But, we don't have to<br> worry about that.<br> If you want something in Chelsea,<br> just get David to take you shopping.<br> Why would David want to<br> take me shopping?<br> I've booked a table at Juliette's.<br> Will that kill the mood,<br> do you think?<br> Oh, I hope so.<br> God, I always think<br> I'm going to my own funeral...<br> ...when I listen to classical music.<br> - That was classical, wasn't it?<br> - Yes. Very classical.<br> - As classical as you can get.<br> - Juliette's it is, then.<br> Heaven forbid that we'd end the evening<br> reflecting on our own mortality.<br> I want a Sunday kind of love <br> A love to last past Saturday night <br> Extraordinary woman right there,<br> just like you, Helen.<br> What about "Chante Francoise Sagan"?<br> Have you heard that one?<br> - It's wonderful<br> - I've only got...<br> Well, I think it's just called<br> "Juliette Greco".<br> The one with the eyes<br> on the sleeve.<br> I saved up and got my<br> French conversation teacher...<br> ...to bring it back<br> after Christmas.<br> You've got a French<br> conversation teacher?<br> - Yes.<br> - Is that why you suddenly speak French...<br> ...for no reason?<br> You never heard her sing?<br> She's marvellous.<br> You'd see her in Paris then, not here.<br> David will take you.<br> I'd love to.<br> You'd fit right in.<br> Better than here, really.<br> Isn't it wonderful to find a young person<br> who wants to know things?<br> There's so much<br> I want you to see.<br> Are you alright to come<br> and have a look at that...<br> ...Pembroke Villas place<br> with me on Friday, Danny?<br> Oh, no. I can't.<br> There's a Burne-Jones coming up<br> at Christie's on Friday.<br> Desperate to get my hands on it.<br> You're thinking of buying<br> a Burne-Jones?<br> A real one?<br> I just had a feeling that the<br> pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.<br> I love the pre-Raphaelites.<br> - Do you?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Um, Rossetti and<br> Burne-Jones, anyway.<br> Not Holman Hunt, so much.<br> He's so garish.<br> Oh, absolutely!<br> Well, why don't we all go<br> to the auction together?<br> Auction?<br> Gosh! How exciting!<br> Next Friday morning.<br> Friday, oh.<br> You're busy?<br> - Yes.<br> - Too bad.<br> What a pity!<br> It's no problem.<br> - Are you sure you're busy?<br> - No.<br> I'm sure I could re-arrange.<br> That would be lovely.<br> You got me wrapped around<br> your little finger <br> If this is love, it's everything<br> I hoped it would be <br> When we kiss,<br> it's as if our lips agree <br> That we were meant to be <br> When we touch, it's too much <br> What are you doing?<br> I can't get this<br> casserole dish clean.<br> It's all burnt round...<br> It's twenty-five to twelve.<br> - We finish tea at seven.<br> - I know what the time is.<br> How was your evening?<br> The best night of my life.<br> Good night, Mom.<br> I can think of two violins,<br> one cello,<br> ...two violas, a harp.<br> I don't want to hear about Ravel.<br> I want to know what else<br> was on the program.<br> Oh, there was nothing like that.<br> He was a perfect gentleman.<br> He just said he wanted to take me<br> places and show me things.<br> - Things?<br> - Plural? My God!<br> I knew that "Jane Eyre" would<br> eventually work its magic upon you.<br> I'm assuming that's what<br> you're so animated about.<br> Of course.<br> - "Jane Eyre" and Jenny's new boyfriend.<br> - He's not my "new boyfriend".<br> Oh, sorry. He's more a<br> man-friend actually.<br> - He's got a sports car, Ms. Stubbs.<br> - It's maroon.<br> So could we call him, uh,<br> Mr. Rochester figure?<br> I think he must be<br> as blind as Mr. Rochester.<br> You may or may not have noticed,<br> I'm trying to stir the subject away...<br> ...from Jenny's lurid love-life<br> and into the matter in hand.<br> And it's clear from this evidence...<br> ...that most of you know<br> far too much about the former...<br> ...and next to nothing<br> about the latter.<br> Reluctantly, I have to admit that<br> Jenny is clearly an expert on both.<br> Excellent as always, Jenny.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Any further bids?<br> Sold them for 60 guineas.<br> - Hello.<br> - You're late.<br> We now turn to lot 41.<br> "The Tree of Forgiveness"<br> by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.<br> This is a rare opportunity to purchase<br> a key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.<br> - Who will start me off at 100 guineas?<br> - Is it that one?<br> Yes, that's the one.<br> Fifty guineas?<br> Twenty guineas?<br> Thank you.<br> Forty?<br> Thank you.<br> Do I hear sixty?<br> Eighty guineas?<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Another one, one hundred guineas?<br> One hundred and twenty?<br> No further bids?<br> Your turn.<br> - What?<br> - Any further bids?<br> - Any more?<br> - Quick!<br> One hundred and twenty guineas from<br> the very eager new bidder.<br> One hundred and forty, madam?<br> Thank you.<br> One hundred and sixty.<br> One hundred and eighty.<br> Thank you.<br> Two hundred guineas?<br> Two hundred and twenty?<br> Another one, madam?<br> Sold for two hundred guineas.<br> Thank you.<br> Your name, please?<br> Mellor.<br> Now we move on to lot 42.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I couldn't have possibly<br> bought it without you.<br> Just a couple of years ago, you'd<br> pick one of them for fifty quid.<br> - No one was interested.<br> - Oh, I'd have been so interested.<br> As you can see,<br> I just love things.<br> That's not a Lockey-Hill!<br> There aren't many people<br> who come in here and say that.<br> - Certainly not me.<br> - Oh, it's beautiful.<br> - Do you play?<br> - I used to.<br> I vowed to myself that<br> one day I'd own one of these.<br> And now I do,<br> I want to never touch it.<br> It's vulgar really,<br> putting it on display.<br> - Give it to Jenny.<br> - Huh?<br> - I think that would be even more vulgar.<br> - Play for us, Jenny.<br> No. I mean, one day.<br> When I'm good enough.<br> - Oh, she's good enough now.<br> - David, you've never seen me play.<br> I can come and hear you in Oxford,<br> when you get there.<br> We should all go and spend<br> a weekend in Oxford.<br> Straw boaters...<br> - punting, cream teas, anti...<br> - Boats?<br> ...quarian bookshops.<br> Bit of business, if we can find it.<br> What about next weekend?<br> Yes.<br> I wouldn't be allowed to do that.<br> I'll talk to them.<br> You're going to ask my father...<br> ...if you can take me away<br> for the weekend?<br> - He'd have you arrested.<br> - We'll see.<br> - I bet you can't.<br> - How much?<br> I'd be careful, if I were you, Jenny.<br> You don't know<br> who you're dealing with.<br> Half-a-crown.<br> You're on.<br> How do you know Danny?<br> Oh, you know.<br> We kept bumping into each other,<br> ...and we became pals,<br> ...ended up doing a bit of business<br> together, when it suits us.<br> What kind of business?<br> Property. A bit of art dealing.<br> Some buying and selling.<br> This and that...<br> Alright, just be two ticks.<br> - Okay.<br> Mr. Goldman,<br> good to see you.<br> Madam. Alright.<br> - Alright, I got this one. And, um...<br> - Put me down.<br> Go on, then.<br> Sorry about that.<br> - How do you know those Negro people?<br> - They're clients.<br> Clients?<br> Schwarzers have to live somewhere.<br> It's not as if they can rent off<br> their own kind, is it?<br> Test results for the Virgil translation.<br> We'll start from the bottom...<br> Patricia.<br> Absent.<br> Margaret.<br> Jenny.<br> That would just about scrape<br> a pass in the exam proper.<br> Not good enough for<br> Oxford candidates.<br> It's her Latin, isn't it?<br> Everyone's doing their best, Jack.<br> But what if everyone's best<br> isn't good enough?<br> What do we do then? Hm?<br> Well, perhaps the whole thing's<br> been a waste of money anyway.<br> You don't mean that.<br> Well, what's she going to do with<br> an English degree?<br> And if she's going to spend three years<br> playing that bloody cello...<br> ...talking in French<br> to a bunch of... beatniks,<br> Well, I'm... I'm just throwing<br> good money after bad.<br> I wish she might meet<br> a nice lawyer.<br> But she could do that<br> at a dinner dance tomorrow.<br> Oh, that's the point of<br> an Oxford education. Isn't it, Dad?<br> It's the expensive alternative<br> to a dinner dance.<br> What about private tuition?<br> Can anybody hear me?<br> How much this is going to cost me?<br> Five shillings an hour.<br> Maybe a little more for A-level.<br> Five bob! We'll spend five bob here,<br> we'll spend five bob there,<br> ...and next thing we know that's<br> our savings down the drain.<br> And what else are we spending<br> five bob on?<br> What else are we<br> spending six pence on?<br> Oh, nothing? No, nothing!<br> All of this is free.<br> This vase... is free.<br> It was, actually.<br> It was a present from Auntie Vi.<br> That chair, this sofa...<br> it's all free.<br> We don't have to pay for<br> any of it.<br> You see, that's<br> the beauty of life, Jenny.<br> You don't have to pay for anything.<br> You know, there's a lovely<br> Oxford tree growing in the garden.<br> Lucky for you, because<br> that's Oxford taken care of.<br> And there's a whole orchard<br> of school trees.<br> So that school is free.<br> And I think there's even a<br> private tuition tree in there.<br> - I'll just go and check, shall I?<br> - Jack?<br> Oh, that's alright, Marjorie.<br> Don't worry, I'll be in a second.<br> Because I think<br> there's a whole clump of them...<br> ...surrounding the pocket<br> money tree.<br> I'll just go and make sure<br> they're all nice and safe, shall I?<br> Oh, by the way,<br> you might be lucky.<br> There might be a man<br> with deep pockets growing out there.<br> Because God know<br> you gonna need one.<br> Well, you can always go to<br> secretarial college with Hattie.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - Charming!<br> - Oh, God, no.<br> - Hello.<br> Hello... Graham.<br> I haven't seen you in ages.<br> It all went wrong, didn't it?<br> The, uh...<br> The tea-party, I mean.<br> Was it because of the<br> year off thing?<br> - Because I...<br> - No.<br> I just have so much work to do...<br> ...if I'm gonna get the grades<br> I need.<br> Yeah. She doesn't have time for boys.<br> - Bye, Graham.<br> - Bye.<br> - Oh, he does all the Goons.<br> - No, my Eccles is no good.<br> - Oh, no, you've got him.<br> - No, no...<br> Hello?<br> Oh, Jenny...<br> ...David does the most<br> fantastic Bluebottle.<br> You came to see my parents?<br> Oh, why is that so hard to imagine?<br> Why are you drinking?<br> It's not Christmas!<br> Well, there's a lot you don't know<br> about us, young lady.<br> - We had a life before you came along.<br> - Hm, that's true.<br> I'm only going on what I've seen<br> over the last sixteen years.<br> I'm trying to think what you missed.<br> Nothing much comes to mind.<br> Anyway, I've got a huge pile<br> of Latin translation to do.<br> You didn't tell us<br> David went to Oxford.<br> No... I didn't.<br> For all the good it did me.<br> - Isn't that funny?<br> - Extraordinary!<br> I was just telling Jack that<br> I'm going back next weekend.<br> I go and visit my old English professor<br> every now and again.<br> See, that's what you need, Jenny.<br> Someone on the inside track.<br> It's not always what you know,<br> is it, David?<br> Too true.<br> - Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?<br> - Dad's never come across anyone.<br> He wrote a children's book called...<br> "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"<br> that did very well, I believe.<br> C. S. Lewis?<br> Well, to us he was just the old codger<br> who taught Medieval literature.<br> But I came to know him very well.<br> We just... got along.<br> Jenny used to devour those books.<br> I'd love to meet him.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Am I being slow on the uptake?<br> Would Jenny like to come<br> with me at the weekend?<br> No, not this weekend.<br> But sometimes, perhaps.<br> Yes.<br> How often do you see him?<br> Not very often,<br> every couple of years.<br> - Maybe next time.<br> - Huh...<br> Well, I suppose...<br> Would she have to stay the night?<br> I wouldn't recommend driving home<br> after one of those Oxford dinners.<br> Clive could get her a room at the college.<br> That's easy enough.<br> Seems like too good an<br> opportunity to pass up.<br> It wouldn't be a bother,<br> would it, David?<br> We walk along hand in hand <br> Come on!<br> Just putting a few things into the bag.<br> Don't worry.<br> Yeah, we both understand <br> Ummm, Sweet Nothin's <br> Come on!<br> We're nearly ready.<br> Be there in two ticks.<br> How can they only be<br> nearly ready?<br> I wouldn't be surprised<br> if three of them come out there.<br> That's the only explanation.<br> They're making themselves a friend.<br> Ladies! Come on, let's go!<br> There. Have a look in the corner.<br> Open the door.<br> You should keep that one<br> if you want to.<br> I can only wear so many on one day.<br> Thank you.<br> What about tonight?<br> We got to put on a nightie.<br> Would David share the room with you?<br> Oh, you haven't slept with him?<br> No.<br> Good for you.<br> - Really? Do you think so?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, you're only sixteen.<br> You don't want to get pregnant, do you?<br> No, I wouldn't...<br> I wouldn't let that happen.<br> I want to wait till<br> I'm seventeen.<br> On my seventeenth<br> birthday, hopefully.<br> With David?<br> Oh Golly, it will be with David,<br> won't it?<br> If that's what you want.<br> Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.<br> Ta-da!<br> Should we make a move?<br> You got me wrapped around<br> your little finger <br> If this is love, it's everything<br> I hoped it would be <br> Can we get off<br> and have a look around?<br> Later.<br> If we have time.<br> - Imagine spending three years here.<br> - Oh, I know.<br> Why university girls are<br> strange-looking?<br> They can't all have started off<br> that way, can they?<br> Well, most girls aren't born ugly,<br> ...but most girl students<br> seems to be. So...<br> ...there must be something<br> about those places that make you...<br> ...fat, or spotty, or short-sighted.<br> Well, if you look at it like that,<br> I mean...<br> ...that's proper scientific analysis.<br> You can't argue with science.<br> I still don't quite understand what<br> you want to do when you get here.<br> I want to read English.<br> Books?<br> - Sorry?<br> - You want to read English books?<br> Reading English is just<br> another way of saying...<br> Don't worry, Jenny.<br> You're wasting your breath.<br> Tomorrow we'll get<br> more of a feel for the place.<br> Absolutely.<br> This place would be good<br> for a little business.<br> - All those little old ladies wandering around.<br> - Old ladies?<br> - I'll bet this place is rife with stats.<br> - Please explain what stats are.<br> You're always going on<br> about them.<br> - It isn't very interesting.<br> - But you two are interested.<br> Because we are not<br> very interesting either.<br> - Oh, no. They're not, really.<br> - True.<br> So we have an idiot here,<br> to save us from ourselves.<br> Yeah, to put some intelligence<br> and culture to our brutal lives.<br> Sing to us! Sing to us!<br> Please don't make me<br> sing to you.<br> Please don't make us<br> talk about work.<br> So...<br> Now, is he Clive,<br> do you think? Or CS?<br> I'm confused now.<br> I thought you'd made him up?<br> No, we...<br> Never mind.<br> "To dear Jenny. "<br> "With the pleasure<br> of meeting you. "<br> "Come and see me<br> again soon. Clive. "<br> Dirty old man.<br> Bad girl.<br> We've got these exact<br> same curtains at home.<br> Let's not talk about curtains.<br> You look beautiful.<br> - David...<br> - Hm?<br> There's something you should know.<br> I'm a virgin.<br> And I want to stay that way<br> until I'm seventeen.<br> I think that's good.<br> I think that's right.<br> We can still be romantic,<br> can't we?<br> Yes, of course.<br> - As long as it's not actually...<br> - Minnie.<br> Is that me?<br> Yes.<br> You're my Minnie Mouse...<br> ...and I'm your bubbalub.<br> Okay... if that's what<br> you want to do.<br> - Minnie.<br> - Yes, David?<br> Bubbalub.<br> Bubbalub.<br> May I have a look?<br> Just a peek.<br> You just want to see them?<br> Thank you.<br> I think there's a house for sale<br> around here.<br> Really?<br> - Might be worth a look.<br> - Hm-hmm.<br> Jenny?<br> - Aren't you coming?<br> - We don't go in.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Why don't you go and get<br> a nice cup of tea somewhere?<br> Helen will look after you.<br> I don't need looking after,<br> thank you very much.<br> - David?<br> - I'm not gonna tell you a second time.<br> Run along.<br> Oh, they won't be long.<br> Either way.<br> Either way?<br> Well, sometimes they find something,<br> sometimes they don't.<br> And when they do find something,<br> ...we often have to leave<br> quite quickly.<br> They can be quite naughty,<br> sometimes.<br> Thank you.<br> - Bye.<br> - See you around.<br> - Catch!<br> Careful! Careful! Careful!<br> Come on.<br> - Helen.<br> - Pass the ball.<br> Good.<br> Jenny!<br> - What?<br> - You can stand there if you like,<br> ...but I won't recommend it.<br> Cooee!<br> Jenny?<br> Sorry about being a little brisk<br> back there, Jenny.<br> It's just the way we do things.<br> Silly, really.<br> Hey, don't forget your case.<br> Who's coming up for a drink?<br> - Jenny?<br> - No.<br> You go. I'll make my<br> own way home.<br> Jenny?<br> Jenny!<br> It's an old map.<br> A speed.<br> Poor dear didn't even know<br> what it was.<br> It's a waste.<br> It shouldn't spend its life...<br> ...on a wall in wherever<br> the hell we were.<br> It should be with us.<br> We have to to look after it properly.<br> - We liberated it.<br> - Liberated!<br> That's one word for it.<br> Don't be bourgeois, Jenny.<br> You're better than that.<br> You drink everything<br> I put in front of you down in one...<br> ...and you slam your glass down<br> on the bar and ask for more.<br> It's wonderful.<br> We're not clever like you,<br> so we've to be clever in other ways,<br> ...because if we weren't,<br> there would be no fun.<br> We have to be clever with maps,<br> and... and...<br> You want to know<br> what stats are?<br> Stats are old ladies who are<br> scared of coloured people.<br> So we move the coloureds in<br> and the old ladies move out...<br> ...and I buy their flats cheap.<br> That's what I do.<br> So now you know.<br> And...<br> ...if you don't like it,<br> I will understand,<br> ...and you can go back<br> to Twickenham...<br> ...and listen to the<br> Home Service...<br> ...and do your<br> Latin homework.<br> But these weekends, and<br> the restaurants and the concerts...<br> They don't grow on trees.<br> This is who we are, Jenny.<br> That's nice.<br> - Come on, you two.<br> - Come on, up!<br> You can have my olive.<br> Come on.<br> I suppose you have<br> homework to do.<br> You've no idea how boring<br> everything was before I met you.<br> Action is character,<br> our English teacher says.<br> I think it means that<br> if we never did anything,<br> ...we wouldn't be anybody.<br> And I never did anything<br> before I met you.<br> And sometimes I think no one's ever done<br> anything in this whole stupid country,<br> ...apart from you.<br> - Okay.<br> - Alright.<br> There you go.<br> Good night.<br> Marjorie, look at this.<br> "Clive"... lucky girl.<br> Never a dull moment with David, eh?<br> Better than that young man<br> you brought home for tea.<br> David's a lot older<br> than Graham.<br> Graham could live to be<br> two hundred years old,<br> ...you'll never see him swanning<br> around with famous authors.<br> Hasn't got it in him.<br> Graham might become<br> a famous author, for all you know.<br> Becoming one<br> isn't the same as knowing one.<br> That shows you're well connected.<br> Very impressive young man,<br> your David.<br> I must admit, life's a<br> little brighter with him around.<br> What the hell are those?<br> Russian Sobranies.<br> Where did they come from?<br> She probably bought them from<br> the Savoy, or Claridges...<br> ...or the opera,<br> or some fancy nightclub.<br> Who knows, with Jenny?<br> Paris. You can't buy them here.<br> - You never bought them yourself?<br> - No. I never.<br> Shut up, you stuck-up cow!<br> But I'll bring you some back,<br> if you like?<br> - You're joking?<br> - No.<br> - He's taking you to Paris?<br> - Yes.<br> - This term?<br> - May be.<br> Wait.<br> Isn't it your birthday<br> next Thursday?<br> Might be.<br> Oh, my God! Your birthday!<br> I would not like to be you.<br> All those supper's<br> you've had off him.<br> Ouch!<br> You've such a Victorian attitude<br> to sex, you two.<br> Your parents wouldn't let you<br> swan off like that, would they?<br> Well, he haven't told them yet.<br> But David will come up with some story,<br> he usually does.<br> Yeah, I've noticed that.<br> Chanel perfume,<br> Chanel perfume.<br> Chanel lipstick,<br> Chanel lipstick.<br> Those funny cigarettes<br> you were smoking. Sobranies.<br> Ten packets each.<br> How much is that Chanel perfume?<br> Are you the girl going to Paris<br> or are you not? Because...<br> Tina, top button.<br> Jenny, the headmistress<br> wants a word with you.<br> The, uh, legend Mr. Rochester may have<br> travelled further than you intended.<br> Come.<br> Ms. Mellor.<br> We're all very excited about...<br> ...your forthcoming trip to Paris.<br> Our excitement, indeed,<br> knows no bounds.<br> Some of us can talk of little else.<br> An older man, I understand.<br> A word of warning, Ms. Mellor.<br> There may well have been the odd...<br> ...sixth-form girl who has lost...<br> ...an important part of herself,<br> perhaps the best part.<br> while under our supervision.<br> These things happen, regrettably.<br> If, however, we are made aware<br> of that loss, then...<br> ...of course the young lady in question...<br> ...would have to continue<br> her studies elsewhere,<br> ...if she still has any use<br> for A-levels.<br> Do I make myself clear?<br> - Can I go now?<br> - If you want.<br> What are you doing in there?<br> Well, I imagine she's lighting<br> the candles on my cake.<br> You're seventeen<br> not two hundred and fifty.<br> - Thanks for inviting me.<br> - Oh, it was Marjorie's idea, not mine.<br> - Not even Jenny's for that matter.<br> - Dad!<br> Well, blow them out,<br> before the house burns down.<br> Wait up!<br> Okay, don't wait.<br> Bravo.<br> - Who'd like a piece?<br> - Me, please.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Presents.<br> What's that?<br> It's a new Latin dictionary.<br> Thank you.<br> I needed a new one.<br> Oh dear.<br> Snap!<br> Oh, good grief!<br> - Jenny, you'd see this.<br> - It's a special day.<br> - She's a special girl.<br> - I know it.<br> Bit of help?<br> Makes your dictionary look<br> a bit feeble, eh, Graham?<br> Gosh!<br> These are for you.<br> - Hello, young man.<br> - Oh, David...<br> - David, would you like a drink?<br> - I'd love one.<br> I'd better be going because...<br> ...I have a stack of<br> homework to do, so...<br> Thank you.<br> - Bye.<br> - See you.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Mellor.<br> - See you, young man.<br> Thank you.<br> Wonderful to see you, Graham.<br> - Goodbye, Jenny.<br> - Bye, Graham.<br> - Little something warming?<br> - You know me so well.<br> - Can I open anything yet?<br> - Wait for me.<br> Before you open that lot,<br> I got a surprise.<br> Next weekend, we're all going<br> to Cafe de Flore...<br> ...to celebrate Jenny's<br> birthday.<br> Lovely.<br> Cafe de Flore is in the Boulevard<br> St. Germain, in Paris.<br> - What do you mean Paris?<br> - You know the one, Dad.<br> No! No!<br> No, no, no...<br> No, we don't have any French money.<br> And besides, it's...<br> Well, I don't think<br> he would agree with me.<br> Dad?<br> The French don't like us, Jenny.<br> You know that.<br> John Sutton from work,<br> he went there last year.<br> They were very rude to him.<br> I don't want to spoil<br> anyone's fun,<br> ...but it's just not for me,<br> Europe.<br> - You'll have to go another time.<br> - You've just said you don't like Europe.<br> So what's going to change?<br> It'll have to be Europe, won't it?<br> Because it certainly won't be you.<br> - I'll take her.<br> - To the continent?<br> - Why not?<br> - And leave me here on my own?<br> Oh, for God's sake!<br> What do you think?<br> You know, what Jenny's<br> like about France, Jack?<br> French films and books<br> and music.<br> - Of course, I do.<br> - Sorry.<br> Yes, because without saying,<br> she's your daughter.<br> Jenny likes to joke about...<br> ...how you're a stick in the mud<br> and all the rest of it.<br> But I know that's not<br> who you are.<br> Otherwise, she wouldn't be,<br> who she is.<br> No.<br> But I can also see that,<br> I've acted out of turn and...<br> ...I'm sorry.<br> What about your aunt Helen?<br> An hour late!<br> - We'll make it, I promise.<br> Okay, there's a flight at eight<br> in the morning.<br> Good.<br> There's no bed!<br> I pushed the boat out<br> and got us a suite.<br> - A suite?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, if work stops us from getting<br> to Paris until tomorrow, then...<br> ...work can buy us<br> a nice hotel room.<br> Anyway, it's a special occasion,<br> isn't it?<br> I'd have thought that tonight<br> of all nights we only need a bed.<br> Hold on... one second.<br> I've got something.<br> I thought...<br> I thought we might<br> practice with this.<br> With a banana?<br> I thought we might get<br> the messy bit over with first.<br> What?<br> David!<br> I don't want to lose my virginity<br> to a piece of fruit.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, I think the moment<br> might have gone.<br> - I think we should wait until Paris.<br> - I'm sorry, um...<br> Minnie.<br> I'm an idiot.<br> I'm sorry.<br> David...<br> ...if tomorrow night does happen,<br> it's only ever going to happen once.<br> Why? Why it only ever happen once?<br> Because the first time can only<br> ever happen once.<br> So...<br> No, baby talk.<br> No Minnie.<br> Just... treat me like a grown-up.<br> Okay?<br> I know. Let's go and sit<br> in our sitting room.<br> Alright.<br> I'll order us some champagne.<br> Room service!<br> bSur Les Quais Du Vieux Paris<br> performed by Juliette Greco/b<br> Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?<br> And it wasn't too uncomfortable?<br> Not after the... first bit.<br> It's funny, though,<br> isn't it?<br> All that poetry,<br> and all those songs...<br> ...about something<br> that lasts no time at all?<br> Yeah.<br> All your exercise books<br> on my desk in a pile, please.<br> I bought this for you.<br> That's very kind of you.<br> But I can't accept it.<br> Why not?<br> It's because of people like you...<br> ...that I plough through illiterate essays<br> by Sandra Lovell about her pony.<br> But I know<br> where this came from, Jenny.<br> And if I took it...<br> ...I'll feel I would be<br> betraying both of us.<br> Jenny.<br> You can do anything you want.<br> You know that.<br> You're clever<br> and you're pretty...<br> Is your boyfriend interested<br> in clever, Jenny?<br> I'm not quite sure<br> what you're trying to tell me.<br> I'm telling you to go to Oxford,<br> no matter what.<br> Because if you don't,<br> you'll break my heart.<br> - Where did you go?<br> - Cambridge.<br> Well, you're clever<br> and you're pretty.<br> So presumably,<br> Clever Miss Stubbs won.<br> And here you are<br> with your pony essays.<br> I don't know.<br> These last few months...<br> I've eaten in wonderful restaurants,<br> and went to jazz clubs,<br> ...and watched wonderful films,<br> ...heard beautiful music.<br> - Jenny, are you taking precautions?<br> - It's nothing to do with that.<br> Isn't it?<br> Maybe all our lives are going<br> to end up with pony essays.<br> Or housework.<br> And yes, maybe<br> we'll go up to Oxford.<br> But if we're all going to die<br> the moment we graduate,<br> ...isn't it what we do<br> before that counts?<br> I'm sorry, you think I'm dead.<br> I don't think you're dead.<br> I just, uh...<br> I think, you'd better<br> get to your next class.<br> Well done, Jenny.<br> I've never won anything before.<br> Not even at the raffle.<br> ...the sweetest looking<br> one of yours always comes last.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Can we do it again? I'm feeling lucky!<br> Come on, let's go.<br> I don't want to miss him.<br> - Pick up your 10 bob on your way out.<br> - I won 10 shillings!<br> Who is this man, anyway?<br> - Peter Rachman.<br> - A complete bastard.<br> Why do we've to see him here?<br> Because he's not a sort of chap<br> with an office.<br> Alright.<br> Ladies...<br> A bottle of your finest champagne, please.<br> There he is.<br> Come on, Jenny.<br> Tell them your good news.<br> Don't be bashful.<br> No. Be sneezy.<br> Jenny got two A's<br> and a B in her mock-A levels.<br> Like everyone else in this<br> sophisticated establishment.<br> - The B was in Latin.<br> - Well, seriously, congratulations.<br> Excuse us.<br> Don't worry too much.<br> About what?<br> Someone told me that in about 50 yrs<br> no one will speak Latin, probably.<br> Not even Latin people.<br> So don't worry about your B.<br> He's even more of a bastard,<br> than I thought.<br> You don't want him<br> to marry your sister.<br> Or want to talk to him in a club,<br> come to that.<br> You do know<br> what you're doing, old chap?<br> With Jenny?<br> - This is the one, Danny.<br> - Right.<br> You can see, she's different.<br> I just don't want to see her hurt.<br> Have you bought any more<br> paintings recently?<br> Have I?<br> Yes. Picked up a little Piper.<br> A good one, I think.<br> I'm still trying to work out<br> what makes good things good.<br> - It's hard, isn't it?<br> - Well, the thing is, Jenny...<br> ...you know,<br> ...without necessarily being<br> able to explain why.<br> See, you've taste.<br> That's not half the battle.<br> That's the whole war.<br> Jenny, we should go.<br> It's late.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Alas. One day, school will be<br> over forever,<br> ...and we can talk about<br> art all night.<br> You're alright in a taxi,<br> aren't you?<br> - Yeah. I'm fine.<br> - Yeah?<br> Let's go.<br> Come on.<br> Good night.<br> Wait here.<br> David, what are you looking for?<br> It's just...<br> What are you doing?<br> Will you marry me?<br> What were you looking for?<br> I... I thought I had a ring.<br> It wouldn't have been the right one.<br> But it would have done for tonight.<br> Oh, David.<br> I'm serious.<br> You're very sweet.<br> What do you think?<br> - Take me home.<br> - Alright.<br> They do need some looking after,<br> ...but nothing that will require<br> too much work.<br> Just leave them in your potting shed<br> for a couple of weeks,<br> ...and they'll look after themselves.<br> Fine, the potting shed.<br> Who does he think I am?<br> Prince Rainier of Monaco?<br> What if I got married<br> instead of going to college?<br> - Married?<br> - Married.<br> Well, it would depend who it was,<br> of course.<br> Would it?<br> - That's interesting.<br> - Of course it would.<br> I wouldn't want you married off<br> just for the sake of it.<br> Thanks.<br> - Has somebody asked you?<br> - Yes.<br> Who?<br> David?<br> No. A man I just met<br> walking his dog.<br> - What did you tell him?<br> - Nothing yet.<br> Do you have a choice?<br> Or is it too late?<br> Of course, she's got a choice.<br> An interesting choice too, eh?<br> This is where<br> you're supposed to say,<br> "But what about Oxford?"<br> Well, looked at it another way,<br> ...you wouldn't really need to go now,<br> would you?<br> I wouldn't need to go.<br> - Would you like to expand on that?<br> - You'd be looked after.<br> All that Latin!<br> All those essays!<br> What was the point?<br> Why didn't you just send me<br> prowling round nightclubs?<br> It would have been less trouble.<br> And I might have had more fun.<br> I don't know about nightclubs,<br> I know about education.<br> Anyway, looks like it might have<br> turned out for the best.<br> How?<br> He wouldn't want you<br> if you were thick, now, would he?<br> May not an ass know<br> when the cart draws the horse?<br> Sings whoop jug,<br> I love thee.<br> And when it says "Sings",<br> ...it means, you sing the line.<br> Never mind. Right.<br> Leer?<br> Does any here know me?<br> This is not Lear.<br> Does Lear walk thus?<br> Speak thus?<br> Where are his eyes?<br> Waking? Who is it that can<br> tell me who I am?<br> Oh, Miss, me.<br> I can.<br> Oh, Jenny.<br> What?<br> Take it off.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Is that what I think it is?<br> I'm going to be a bridemaid!<br> You know the school rule on jewelry.<br> Half the girls in this room<br> are wearing jewelry.<br> Yes. But none of it is<br> going to ruin their lives.<br> We have a difference of opinion<br> about that.<br> How far advanced are these<br> ridiculous plans?<br> Have you set a date?<br> Have you decided on a church?<br> We won't be getting married<br> in a church.<br> David's Jewish.<br> Jewish?<br> He's a Jew?<br> You're aware, I take it,<br> that the Jews killed our Lord?<br> And you're aware, I suppose,<br> that our Lord was Jewish?<br> I suppose he told you that.<br> We're all very sorry about<br> what happened at during the War.<br> But that's absolutely no excuse<br> for that sort of...<br> ...malicious and untruthful<br> propaganda.<br> Anyway, I can see, you're far more<br> in need of responsible advice...<br> ...than I realised.<br> Nobody does anything<br> worth doing without a degree.<br> Nobody does anything<br> worth doing with a degree.<br> No woman, anyway.<br> So what I do isn't worth doing?<br> Or what Ms. Stubbs does,<br> or Mrs. Wilson, or any of us here?<br> Because none of us would be here<br> without our degree,<br> ...you do realise that,<br> don't you?<br> And yes, of course studying is hard,<br> and boring...<br> - Boring!<br> - I'm sorry?<br> Studying is hard and boring.<br> Teaching is hard and boring.<br> So you're telling me to be bored,<br> and then bored,<br> ...and finally bored again,<br> but this time for the rest of my life.<br> This whole stupid country is bored.<br> There's no life in it,<br> or colour, or fun.<br> It's probably just as well,<br> the Russians are gonna drop...<br> ...a nuclear bomb on<br> us any day now. So...<br> ...my choice is to do<br> something hard and boring,<br> ...or to marry my Jew.<br> And go to Paris and Rome<br> and listen to jazz...<br> ...and read and eat good food<br> in nice restaurants...<br> ...and have fun.<br> It's not enough to educate us<br> any more, Ms. Walters.<br> You've got to tell us,<br> why you're doing it.<br> It doesn't have to be teaching,<br> you know?<br> There's the Civil Service.<br> I don't wish to be impertinent,<br> Ms. Walters.<br> But it is an argument<br> worth rehearsing.<br> You never know.<br> Someone else might want to know<br> the point of it all, one day.<br> Where did you find him?<br> I can't tell you that.<br> - Why?<br> - I think he likes you.<br> Do you like her?<br> "I thought you would like her. "<br> You... you don't?<br> What?<br> You don't remember?<br> It's Jenny!<br> You remember her from last time.<br> "No, I don't. "<br> Yes, you do!<br> You naughty!<br> You're pardoned?<br> Stick to your own species.<br> He wants to kiss you,<br> I think.<br> Isn't that naughty?<br> We are engaged.<br> No!<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Engaged?<br> - Show her.<br> Yes, look!<br> Gosh! That's fantastic news.<br> Thank you.<br> Congratulations.<br> I knew you'd see sense<br> about university.<br> You'll stay pretty now.<br> Can I still read?<br> Of course, but it doesn't<br> have to be books, does it?<br> And magazines will do just as well.<br> And you learn<br> more from them anyway.<br> Oh, Helen.<br> Oh, you won't be laughing, David,<br> ...when she gets all speccy<br> and spotty.<br> Danny didn't seem very pleased<br> about our engagement.<br> I noticed that, too!<br> Thought he might be a bit jealous.<br> Jealous?<br> We're going to keep him<br> away from you.<br> I mean, what I'm supposed to order<br> for starter, anyway?<br> And how will I know what is a starter<br> and what isn't?<br> We've been through this, Dad.<br> It'll be quite clearly marked<br> on the menu.<br> Oh, can't the three of you<br> just go on your own?<br> Leave me here. I'll be perfectly<br> happy with a tin of salmon.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Ready?<br> I think you'll like this place, Jack.<br> Their wine list is as good as<br> anything I've seen in London.<br> Yes, someone told me that.<br> David, probably.<br> Who else would it have been?<br> Madam.<br> I was hoping<br> you'd take us in this.<br> Hey, you won't want to drive in<br> anything else after tonight.<br> - Mind you, it drinks petrol.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm afraid we'll have to stop<br> on the way into town.<br> - I feel like Eamonn Andrews.<br> - Is that a good thing?<br> Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person<br> that Jack can imagine being.<br> How are you tonight, sir?<br> - Very well.<br> You might as well fill her up.<br> I'm gonna make a quick call.<br> I'll be two ticks.<br> Do you think I should offer to help,<br> pay for the petrol?<br> Would he feel insulted,<br> what do you think?<br> I know, he said tonight was his treat.<br> But, does that apply to the petrol,<br> what do you think?<br> I'm quite sure it does, Jack.<br> - Jack!<br> - Come on, it just came off.<br> - Filled my bill? Huh?<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Take this.<br> Jenny! Jenny...<br> - Take us home.<br> - What's wrong?<br> I'm afraid there's been...<br> - Jenny's in bit of a shock.<br> - What's happened?<br> It's just another one of David's<br> little muddles and misunderstandings.<br> I don't want to hear another word<br> from anybody.<br> - Take us home. Now!<br> - Fine.<br> You can take care of this,<br> can't you, David?<br> Go inside, Dad.<br> Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman,<br> Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman,<br> Mr. and Mrs. David...<br> You're married!<br> Legally, yes, but I...<br> When were you going to tell me?<br> Soon.<br> It just never seemed<br> like the right time.<br> You seemed so happy,<br> and I was happy...<br> You were living with your wife!<br> All this time!<br> Around the corner!<br> Byron Avenue!<br> It's no wonder we kept bumping<br> into each other, is it?<br> - What number?<br> - Thrity four.<br> Don't be like this.<br> Come on.<br> I have nothing.<br> I didn't take my exams.<br> I do...<br> I left school.<br> Where's it all gone, now?<br> I can get a divorce.<br> Everything will turn out for the best.<br> Go and tell them.<br> Go and tell them,<br> then go and tell your wife.<br> They won't listen now.<br> Alright?<br> I'll come round tomorrow.<br> When...<br> ...everyone's a bit calmer.<br> Please don't leave me...<br> Please don't leave me<br> to tell them on my own.<br> You owe me that much.<br> You owe them that much.<br> I owe them much more than that.<br> Two minutes. And then<br> I'll come out and drag you in.<br> What's going on?<br> He's helping himself to some<br> Dutch courage before facing you.<br> Stolen Dutch courage,<br> from the look of it.<br> He has something<br> he has to tell you.<br> He just drove off.<br> Can you tell us?<br> Jenny, please?<br> I wouldn't worry about it too much.<br> - When I found out...<br> - Not now, Helen.<br> I tried to tell him.<br> I'm not speaking to him now,<br> ...if that's any consolation.<br> It's a funny world<br> you people live in.<br> You both watched me<br> carrying on with a married man,<br> ...and you did't think<br> it's worth saying anything about.<br> If you want that conversation...<br> You watched David and I<br> help ourselves to a map,<br> ...and you didn't say much either.<br> Come on, you.<br> Let's go.<br> Good boy.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Sorry, I think<br> I have the wrong number.<br> I was looking for my...<br> I wanted number for my cello lesson.<br> Oh, no.<br> Don't tell me.<br> Good God!<br> You're a child.<br> You didn't know about<br> any of this.<br> Presumably.<br> No. They never do.<br> You're not in the family way,<br> are you?<br> Because that's happened before.<br> Thank God for that.<br> No. No.<br> You stay here.<br> Did you see her?<br> - Yes, I saw her.<br> I didn't talk to her.<br> There wasn't any need.<br> We've to have this out.<br> Well, if you won't do it,<br> I will.<br> - I'm still your father.<br> - You're my father again, are you?<br> What were you when you encouraged<br> me to throw my life away?<br> Silly schoolgirls are always getting<br> seduced by glamorous older men.<br> What about you two?<br> Jenny?<br> Jenny?<br> Jenny, I'm sorry.<br> I know... I know I've made<br> a mess of everything.<br> All my life I've been scared,<br> I didn't want you to be scared.<br> That's why I wanted you<br> to go to Oxford.<br> And then along came David, and...<br> ...he knew famous writers,<br> ...he knew how to get to<br> classical music concerts.<br> But he wasn't<br> who he said he was.<br> He wasn't who you said<br> he was, either.<br> The other day, your mother<br> and I were listening to a...<br> ...a program on the radio about<br> C.S. Lewis and they said...<br> ...that he moved to Cambridge<br> in 1954.<br> I... I said...<br> well, they've got that wrong.<br> Our Jenny wouldn't have<br> his name in her book...<br> ...if he'd moved to Cambridge.<br> There's a cup of tea<br> and some biscuits out here.<br> How do you think we can help?<br> I want to repeat my last year<br> at school.<br> And take my exams.<br> I got the impression<br> the last time we spoke...<br> ...that you didn't see<br> the point of school.<br> Or of me,<br> or of any of us here.<br> I know. I was stupid.<br> The life I want...<br> there's no shortcut.<br> I know now that<br> I need to go to university.<br> It gives me absolutely<br> no pleasure whatsoever to see...<br> ...our young schoolgirls<br> throwing their lives away.<br> Although, of course, you're not<br> one of our schoolgirls any more.<br> Through your own volition.<br> I suppose you think<br> I'm a ruined woman.<br> You're not a woman.<br> No, I'm afraid, I think that<br> the offer of a place at this school...<br> ...would be wasted on you.<br> Come in.<br> I didn't expect to see you again.<br> This is lovely.<br> All your books and<br> pictures and...<br> Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.<br> That's all you need, isn't it?<br> Just somewhere to...<br> I'm sorry<br> I said those silly things.<br> I didn't understand them.<br> Let's forget about it.<br> A Burne-Jones.<br> - Do you like him?<br> - I do.<br> Still.<br> Still?<br> You sound very old and wise.<br> I feel old.<br> But not very wise.<br> Ms. Stubbs, I need your help.<br> I was so hoping<br> that's what you were gonna say.<br> Thank you, Marjorie.<br> It's from Oxford.<br> It is my pleasure,<br> to inform you that...<br> ...your application to read English<br> at Oxford has been accepted.<br> On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,<br> staff of the University...<br> So I went to read English books.<br> And did my best to avoid the speccy-spotty<br> fate that Helen had predicted for me.<br> I probably look as wide-eyed,<br> fresh and artless...<br> ...as any other student.<br> But I wasn't.<br> One of the boys I went out with,<br> and they really were boys,<br> ...once asked me to<br> go to Paris with him.<br> And I told him,<br> I'd love to.<br> I was dying to see Paris.<br> As if I'd never been!<br> Subtitle by silentFX<br>
