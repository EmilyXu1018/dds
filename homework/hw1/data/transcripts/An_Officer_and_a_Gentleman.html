She just checked out.<br> I always hated her for that.<br> Oh, God. That must really hurt.<br> Hurt? No. No.<br> You're all alone in the world.<br> Once you got that down,<br> nothing hurts anymore.<br> I bet most people buy that line<br> when you feed it to them.<br> Hey, are you really serious<br> about having him over?<br> I haven't made up my mind yet.<br> Paula...just how far<br> would you go to get Zack?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You know what I mean.<br> Would you let yourself get pregnant?<br> No way, Lynette. Would you?<br> Well...I never used to think<br> I'd do something like that.<br> But I don't know anymore.<br> Nine weeks just ain't long enough<br> for a guy to fall in love with you.<br> That doesn't justify trapping him<br> or getting pregnant.<br> I can't believe you'd think that.<br> It's real backward.<br> It ain't any more backward<br> than the way these hotshot assholes<br> use us till they've had enough,<br> then ditch us like we's trash.<br> Don't you ever feel used, Paula?<br> Don't you feel the sons of bitches<br> ought to be paying for our troubles?<br> No. I never feel like that.<br> Well, I do.<br> Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.<br> It was my pleasure.<br> Those are the most beautiful<br> things I've ever saw.<br> Wipe that stuff off your mouth.<br> Zack?<br> This is great.<br> Sir?<br> How many more weeks till graduation?<br> Three more. Three more weeks.<br> Those are the roughest, aren't they?<br> That's what they tell me.<br> Sir, why are you staring at my food?<br> Or are you staring at me?<br> Staring at you.<br> He doesn't mean anything by it.<br> Do you, Joe?<br> No, I don't mean anything by it.<br> - Like some more chicken, Zack?<br> - No. No, thanks.<br> I've had it.<br> I can't eat another bite.<br> I'm stuffed, too.<br> This is the best meal<br> I've had in a long time.<br> Let's go, Zack. Thank you, Mama.<br> - Thank you, Zack.<br> - Thanks again, ma'am.<br> Go on and eat.<br> Mama, Mama, Mama!<br> I'm sorry. I'm so embarrassed, Zack.<br> I shouldn't have brought you here.<br> That's OK. A great free meal.<br> A nice, relaxing dinner.<br> Those people are so uptight.<br> I felt so sorry for you.<br> Don't. I'm used to it.<br> It's hereditary.<br> After this, you go to basic flight<br> which is in Pensacola, right?<br> Yeah, Pensacola.<br> And...going to Beeville, Texas,<br> when I get jets.<br> So, after that...<br> don't you think about...<br> I mean, come on... What's after that?<br> Family, kids...<br> Don't you think about all that?<br> No.<br> - Is that what you think about?<br> - Sometimes.<br> If I could do a better job than them,<br> I'd love it.<br> And what would you do different?<br> Everything.<br> First, I'd marry a man<br> I really loved.<br> So why did your mom marry this guy<br> if she didn't love him?<br> My real father wouldn't marry her.<br> - Your real father?<br> - My real father.<br> I want to show you my real father.<br> Pop.<br> Your real father<br> was an Officers Candidate like me?<br> - About 22 years ago.<br> - Jesus.<br> No wonder this guy was looking<br> at me funny.<br> He always looks funny.<br> It's about time<br> I got back to the wars.<br> Yeah, I know, I know.<br> Thank your mom for dinner, OK?<br> - Great chicken, huh?<br> - I loved the chicken.<br> If you get a chance,<br> why don't you call me?<br> I have survival training this week,<br> so I can't make any promises.<br> No promises.<br> I didn't have to show you<br> that picture if I didn't want to.<br> - I wanted to tell you that.<br> - I know. Bye, baby.<br> - Be careful on that.<br> - Yeah.<br> You and Paula still seeing<br> those flight candidates?<br> Any reason we wouldn't be?<br> It's 3:40 and you haven't said<br> what you're doing this weekend.<br> Hi. I'd like to speak with Zack Mayo.<br> He's an AOC candidate.<br> Could you look for him?<br> Tell him it's Paula.<br> Liberty time, boys and girls.<br> Fall out!<br> Aye, aye, sir!<br> - Where you going? Where's my bread?<br> - Forget that thing.<br> Come on, Perryman. Come on.<br> - Seeger, don't forget TJ's.<br> - I won't.<br> Hey, Mayo! You got a phone call.<br> Somebody named Paula.<br> Tell her I already split.<br> I see. OK.<br> Comes a time<br> right after survival training,<br> they start thinking<br> they can make it without you.<br> Suddenly, they stop calling.<br> Suddenly, they own the goddamn world.<br> They said that he already left.<br> I don't think he did.<br> He hasn't called by now,<br> he won't call.<br> Bunny, just shut up!<br> You don't know so much.<br> Clock me out, Lynette.<br> Paula, what are you doing?<br> May they all crash and burn.<br> - Paula, wait! Where are you going?<br> - Let me go, Mama.<br> You're going to look for Zack.<br> Don't do it.<br> I love him. I can't let him go.<br> How will you stop him?<br> I don't know,<br> but I'll think of a way.<br> - No!<br> - No?<br> I can't let you do this.<br> Don't go. Please, don't go.<br> What are you crying about?<br> Cos I know what you're feeling!<br> - What am I feeling?<br> - Don't do it. Let him go.<br> Don't trick him or trap him.<br> I wouldn't do that.<br> I'd never try to trap him.<br> If you find him,<br> you'll say anything. You will.<br> And God help you after that.<br> Mama, you're right.<br> Daddy, Zack's 2/10 of a second<br> off the obstacle course record.<br> He'll break it before he leaves.<br> Lucky you weren't<br> in the program when I was.<br> You couldn't quit<br> the way you can now.<br> When I and my oldest boy<br> went through it,<br> you bilged out, you became a swabby.<br> That's real interesting, sir.<br> How come you haven't written<br> Susan in over three weeks?<br> We haven't had time to write anybody.<br> I've only written y'all once.<br> It's incredible.<br> - Right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Who is this Susan?<br> - My girl back home.<br> I'm marrying her<br> as soon I get out of here.<br> She was Tommy's girl.<br> They were supposed to get<br> married before he got killed.<br> I didn't want you to think<br> I was a shit for fucking Lynette.<br> Man, I ain't your parents.<br> Do you love this girl?<br> Greatest chick you'll ever know.<br> She loves kids.<br> Works with handicapped kids<br> every afternoon.<br> That ain't what I'm talking about.<br> I asked you if you loved her.<br> Everybody loves her.<br> - I won't make that reunion tonight.<br> - Why not?<br> I'm meeting Lynette at the Tides.<br> Best head in 52 states.<br> What can I do?<br> No, no, no.<br> You should've done what I did...<br> break it off clean,<br> have it done with, over.<br> It's the best.<br> She was torn up you didn't call her.<br> I'm not supposed to tell you that.<br> Women. Women, women, women.<br> They say, "A lot of laughs,<br> no problems."<br> Doesn't work that way, does it?<br> Look out, TJ's! Here I come.<br> See you later, man.<br> I don't know<br> what you're smiling about, Perryman.<br> You're lucky you're here.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I still taste that bug.<br> A toast. We made it.

Obviously.<br> How was your week?<br> It was good.<br> I'm getting a raise<br> beginning of next month.<br> That's great.<br> You're graduating in a couple weeks?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm starting to believe I'll make it.<br> You'll make it.<br> I told you -<br> you saw it, and it happened.<br> Yeah, you told me.<br> I got to go, I have a date. So...<br> Look, there's something I wanted...<br> What?<br> I...I wanted to thank you.<br> I wouldn't have made it<br> through this crazy thing<br> if I didn't have something<br> to look forward to.<br> Don't thank me for nothing.<br> I had a good time.<br> Good luck in Pensacola<br> with your flight training, and...<br> Get jets, huh?<br> I'll see you, Zack.<br> Give me another one.<br> In fact, give me the bottle.<br> Come here, baby doll.<br> Come here.<br> Come over here.<br> Sit down for a second.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> Had to have one more taste.<br> This stuff come in anything<br> besides strawberry?<br> I'll bring some coconut next time.<br> Sid...I've really got to go.<br> Shouldn't you have<br> got your period by now?<br> I'm a little late, that's all.<br> How late are you?<br> Why? What's the difference?<br> If anything happened,<br> it would be my responsibility.<br> Now, just exactly how late are you?<br> What do you care?<br> Suppose I was to get pregnant.<br> Just suppose. I'd never make you do<br> something you didn't want to do.<br> I know.<br> But that's not the only issue here.<br> There's more to it than that.<br> What other issue is there, Sid?<br> My responsibility as its father,<br> for one thing.<br> If I've got you pregnant,<br> I'll do the right thing by you.<br> I'll pay for the abortion,<br> be with you through it, comfort you.<br> We'd go through it together.<br> So how late are you?<br> Let's just wait<br> and see what happens, OK?<br> See you later.<br> I'll call you.<br> Fuck!<br> Last chance for the record!<br> Go!<br> This is it, Mayonnaise. Go!<br> Come on!<br> Go for it, Mayo!<br> Go get it! You got it!<br> Go, Mayo! Push it!<br> Put your name on that wall!<br> Mike, let's catch that animal!<br> Let's do this together, Seeger.<br> - Come on, Seeger.<br> - Forget it, just go for the record.<br> Come on! You got it!<br> Come on, man!<br> Hey! Where you going?<br> - Seeger, get up.<br> - Forget it.<br> You want jets? Then get up!<br> You're going over! Right here!<br> Three steps. Right, left, right.<br> Hand over hand. Walk the wall.<br> - Come on, Seeger.<br> - Ready? Let's go!<br> Left, right, pull!<br> Walk that wall, Seeger! Walk it!<br> Hand over hand!<br> Hand over hand! Walk it! Walk it!<br> Walk the wall! Seeger! Seeger, walk!<br> Seeger!<br> Don't you let go! You walk that wall!<br> Pull! Pull! Pull, Candidate Seeger!<br> Pull! One leg! You got it!<br> Pull over! Pull over!<br> Pull yourself over! All right!<br> Where's Sid?<br> What makes you think she's not lying?<br> She went to a doctor. She's pregnant.<br> So get an abortion.<br> I'd love to, believe me.<br> She won't even talk about it.<br> She's Catholic.<br> You're not marrying this girl.<br> If I don't, she'll have the baby<br> on her own somewhere.<br> Women do it all the time.<br> I can't let her have a kid<br> by herself. It's my kid, too.<br> You sure?<br> It's mine.<br> I'm sorry, all right?<br> What if Foley was right?<br> She got knocked up to trap you.<br> Is it still your responsibility?<br> That's not the point.<br> No matter how it happened,<br> the child would still be mine.<br> I wouldn't know<br> where it was or nothing.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> Is everything your responsibility?<br> Sit. Adjust. Pray. Attack.<br> It's like your brother<br> getting killed.<br> It's the same damn thing -<br> him getting killed instead of you.<br> That's why you promised<br> to marry Susan.<br> You do everything<br> out of some bullshit code of ethics.<br> It may be bullshit to you,<br> but I wasn't raised that way!<br> We're responsible<br> for the people in our lives.<br> That's all that separates us<br> from the animals!<br> I'm not like you, Mayo.<br> I can't shit on people<br> and sleep at night.<br> I say you're responsible<br> to yourself first.<br> If you can't handle that,<br> you got bigger problems<br> than making some girl pregnant!<br> Gentlemen, relax.<br> Without an oxygen mask<br> at 30,000 feet,<br> your insides will feel<br> like this rubber glove.<br> Your coordination deteriorates.<br> Even the most childlike exercises<br> seem impossible.<br> Look for the warning signs...<br> giddiness, shortness of breath,<br> claustrophobia.<br> They can hit you at any moment.<br> The instant you feel yourself<br> losing control, go back on oxygen.<br> That's the purpose of this drill.<br> Does everyone understand<br> the exercises?<br> OK, everybody set?<br> Let's see a thumbs up, please.<br> Very good. Everybody remove<br> your mask, please.<br> All right. Begin the exercises now.<br> Queen of diamonds.<br> Nine of diamonds.<br> If you have any problems,<br> put your mask on.<br> If you can't, raise your hand,<br> and the corpsman will assist you.<br> How you doing, Mayo and Seeger?<br> Having a little trouble?<br> Concentrate.<br> Try to make your palms meet.<br> Ace of spades.<br> How you doing down there, Worley?<br> Worley, are you all right?<br> - Worley, can you hear me?<br> - Ace of spades.<br> Worley, put your mask back on,<br> please.<br> Put your mask back on!<br> - Sid, you OK?<br> - Sid!<br> I got to get out.<br> Worley, sit down.<br> Corpsman, we got a problem.<br> I got to get out of here!<br> Corpsman, get that mask on.<br> It's all right.<br> Get out of here!<br> It's all right. Breathe! Breathe!<br> Mayo, they're watching!<br> We're going<br> to stabilize the pressure.<br> It's OK. All right. Everything's OK.<br> Everybody's watching you. Hold on.<br> We'll stabilize the pressure now.<br> Man the doors. One minute.<br> Stay where you are.<br> Leave your masks on!<br> - He's got it.<br> - He's fine.<br> He's OK. No problem. He's OK.<br> Colours!<br> Secure the halyard!<br> Charlie, take care of that.<br> What's going on?<br> You didn't kick him out?<br> Did he tell you what<br> he's been going through?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> What does matter is that<br> he freaked out at 25,000 feet.<br> That can't happen ever.<br> He's got a girl who's pregnant.<br> That don't matter.<br> Don't matter?<br> You've got two weeks left!<br> That can happen to you,<br> too, Mayonnaise.<br> He ain't bullshitting you, buddy.<br> I'm talking to you, motherfucker!<br> Don't fuck for you!<br> What did you call me?<br> I thought the DI's<br> were supposed to help.<br> What kind of a human being are you?<br> Lock it up or you'll go with him.<br> Go back to the barracks. Please?<br> I don't get this.<br> He's the best candidate in the class!<br> The best student, the best leader...<br> the best friend to everybody.<br> Can't you bend your goddamn rules?<br> He didn't ask me to DOR.<br> I went to him.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm glad it's over.<br> I was here for everybody but me.<br> I was here for my big brother.<br> Hey, buddy.<br> Sid, wait a minute.

It's beautiful!<br> It cost my savings,<br> but what the fuck?<br> Oh, God! Sid!<br> So...does this mean...<br> Yes, ma'am! That's what it means!<br> Oh, Sid!<br> Let's do it right now!<br> I wonder where we'll get stationed?<br> I've always wanted to go to Hawaii!<br> Honey, we're not being<br> stationed anywhere. I DOR'd.<br> - You what?<br> - I DOR'd.<br> I wasn't cut out to be a pilot.<br> I was faking it. I've been<br> faking everything up to now.<br> But...<br> What'll we do? Where would we go?<br> Oklahoma.<br> I'll get my old job<br> back at JC Penney's.<br> Hell, in two years,<br> I'll be floor manager.<br> You're going to love Oklahoma.<br> You and mama will get along great.<br> Money might be tight,<br> so we'll live at home.<br> It's going to work out.<br> Sid... There's no baby.<br> What?<br> I'm not pregnant.<br> I got my period this morning.<br> There's no baby, Sid.<br> I'll be goddamned.<br> What do you say<br> we get married anyway?<br> I love you!<br> I don't think I really knew<br> that till just now, just this second.<br> I have never been happier in my life<br> than I have in the last seven weeks.<br> I've never felt so relaxed,<br> and I've never felt so loved<br> for who I really am.<br> Lynette, marry me.<br> Make me the happiest man<br> in the whole world.<br> I'm sorry, Sid.<br> But I don't want to marry you.<br> I really like you,<br> and we've had ourselves<br> some really great times,<br> but I thought you understood.<br> I want to marry a pilot.<br> I want to live my life overseas...<br> the wife of an aviator!<br> Damn you!<br> Goddamn you!<br> Nobody DORs after 11 weeks!<br> Nobody!<br> Hi, ma'am.<br> Have you seen Paula around?<br> Paula!<br> I'm looking for Sid. He DOR'd<br> and split. Nobody's seen him since.<br> I don't know where to look.<br> - Same room?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Number three.<br> Yep.
