Oh!<br> - Happy Easter, Excellency.<br> - What is it you want, Stepan?<br> Could you drive to the Kasbek<br> and ask General Bounine<br> to come here immediately?<br> Isn't it too late for the Church<br> to save that master of yours?<br> - Twenty-five francs?<br> - No. Ten.<br> On Easter night? Twenty.<br> - Fifteen, Excellency.<br> - All right, Stepan.<br> - Happy Easter to you.<br> - Please. Hurry.<br> - Leave it to me.<br> - It's very urgent. Please.<br> [Horn Honking]<br> ?? [Gypsy Violins]<br> Look, Bob.<br> Don't you adore Russian food?<br> Faster! Faster!<br> Faster! General...<br> - I'm just mad for your place.<br> - It's always a pleasure<br> to see you here, madame.<br> General Bounine, my husband.<br> Excuse me, General,<br> The Count Beresoff is<br> waiting outside in his taxi,<br> - He has a message for you.<br> - From Stepan?<br> - Yes. He says it is urgent.<br> - I'll be right out.<br> Will you forgive me<br> for just a moment?<br> ?? [Gypsy Violins Continue]<br> ?? [Bells Ringing,<br> Choir Singing In Russian]<br> - Is she here?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Where?<br> - Over there. By the tree.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yes, Excellency.<br> All right. Wait here.<br> Happy Easter.<br> Happy Easter, Anna Koreff.<br> It is Anna Koreff.<br> Or at least, so you were called<br> in the asylum at St. Cloud.<br> - You see the resemblance?<br> - No more than 100 women might have.<br> There is nothing to fear,<br> I promise you.<br> - Why do you always run away?<br> - Always questions.<br> I've lost the answers.<br> Perhaps if you hadn't told the nun<br> who you were, there wouldn't be<br> any questions.<br> - Who am I?<br> - Grand Duchess Anastasia, I believe.<br> In an asylum,<br> a nun might be mad.<br> - It's contagious.<br> - Then you do admit that you were<br> in that asylum, don't you?<br> ?? [Continues]<br> Stepan, are you positive she is<br> the same woman you saw in St. Cloud?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Come on.<br> ? [Accordion]<br> [Police Whistle Blowing]<br> [Footsteps Running]<br> [Coughing]<br> [Tin Can Rattling]<br> Let me go, please!<br> Let me go!<br> ? [Singing In Russian]<br> ? [Singing In Russian]<br> The General said to wait for him<br> at the usual place.<br> Wait! How do you like that?<br> The nerve of that Bounine.<br> - Didn't he leave us a message?<br> - Yes. He said he'd be back shortly.<br> Late! Always late.<br> - Petrovin, the hour has<br> arrived for me to tell...<br> - I know.<br> You only tell me what<br> you're going to tell Bounine.<br> Still, be happy now. In one week,<br> you shall be telling it in prison.<br> Petrovin, I forbid that word.<br> - I didn't hear it.<br> - It's the logical end to what<br> was always a ridiculous scheme.<br> Ridiculous scheme, huh?<br> But your eyes lit up like<br> those of a mad monk...<br> when you heard our tsar's daughter<br> might be alive.<br> - That was ridiculous.<br> - And yours lit up...<br> when you heard he had<br> a 10 million inheritance.<br> - Equally ridiculous.<br> - Not equally.<br> The 10 million lie waiting<br> in the Bank of England.<br> But the Grand Duchess Anastasia<br> Nicolaevna lies buried in Russia.<br> - Vodka?<br> - No, thank you. My digestion<br> has been shocking...<br> ever since Bounine decided<br> to form our corporation.<br> Bounine decided?<br> The idea was mine!<br> My years of banking experience<br> are for nothing, huh?<br> I devised the method of<br> selling shares to stockholders...<br> to pay for the search for<br> their beloved grand duchess.<br> I worked out the ratio of<br> so many shares in her inheritance...<br> to so many shares of our stock.<br> - And my advice...<br> - I know! Bounine was nothing.<br> Bounine was nothing...<br> Good evening, comrades.<br> If the term doesn't grate<br> on your White Russian ears.<br> - Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. L...<br> - Excuse me.<br> - The meeting is called to order.<br> - "Called to order."Just like that?<br> May we have<br> the financial report, please?<br> - The financial...<br> - Yes, the financial report.<br> - There's another report, General.<br> - All in due time, Petrovin.<br> Go ahead, Chernov.<br> As of today, our treasury<br> shows assets...<br> of, uh, here... exactly 5,250 francs.<br> That new suit looks<br> very well on you, Chernov.<br> Am I wrong, or were there not some<br> My dear general,<br> may I ask you...<br> May I ask you what paid for<br> this club of yours?<br> the stockholders, that's what!<br> - We live in one room, Petrovin and l...<br> - Two.<br> - We share the bedroom.<br> - This is not a meeting<br> on your housing problem.<br> - Proceed with the accounts.<br> - [Chernov] Housing problem, hmph!<br> Umm, 275 francs<br> to Natalya Yakovski...<br> formerly dressmaker<br> to the Imperial family,<br> Paid for the information received<br> on clothes and measurements,<br> - I see you have made<br> good use of the information.<br> - I drew it myself.<br> - Those are her exact measurements.<br> - The crown is a nice touch.<br> Yeah.<br> A face would be a better one.<br> It's all too late now!<br> We're facing disaster.<br> As a son of the former deacon<br> to His Majesty's court,<br> you should have more faith.<br> I wish my poor father,<br> bless his soul, had had less.<br> All right, Chernov, please.<br> Give him the news.<br> I would rather have his first.<br> - Mine?<br> - I know that smile.<br> I'll bet you have another<br> of your brilliant surprises for us.<br> - Never mind. What happened, Petrovin?<br> - Chernov was called...<br> I was summoned by<br> the stockholder's committee.<br> - Oh, how kind of them.<br> - Kind, huh? [Chuckles]<br> Old General Anikin came<br> straight to the point.<br> "Years ago," he said, "rumors started<br> that the Grand Duchess<br> Anastasia Nicolaevna...<br> "daughter of His Imperial Majesty<br> Nicholas II...<br> "had not been murdered with<br> the rest of the royal family...<br> "but had escaped<br> miraculously.<br> "Ayear ago," he went on,<br> "you and your friends came<br> to us with the claim...<br> "you knew Her Highness<br> was somewhere in Berlin.<br> Then you said you found<br> her, but she ran away."<br> Was it then we thought of<br> using the redhead?<br> - No, no, the one<br> who was always giggling.<br> - Ah yes, the redhead came later.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - "Then," he said, "you needed<br> more money to find her.<br> "Again we subscribed.<br> Then you said you found her,<br> but she was too sick.<br> - More money."<br> - Too sick?<br> - Oh, that was Galina. Too stupid.<br> - "How long can she be sick, Chernov?<br> How much money can you drain<br> from our thin pockets, Chernov?"<br> - How much have they got, Chernov?<br> - The joke is on us, General.<br> - They give us exactly eight days.<br> - Eight days for what?<br> Eight days to produce Her Highness,<br> the Grand Duchess Anastasia.<br> - Or we go to prison for fraud.<br> - For fraud!<br> - Well, it has taken them long enough.<br> - Is that all you can say?<br> It really sickens me how<br> you let him make you suffer...<br> how you like to suffer...<br> and you delight in making him suffer.<br> Not particularly. I merely<br> thought it advisable...<br> to determine exactly<br> what our situation was...<br> - before suggesting how to deal with it.<br> - What did I tell you?<br> All right, General.<br> Let's have your surprise. Where is she?<br> - Where is who?<br> - The woman Stepan saw<br> in the asylum in St. Cloud!<br> Correct. We have<br> finally tracked her down.<br> - Really?<br> - No!<br> - Of course, she does not<br> admit that she was there.<br> - No.<br> - Really?<br> - Nor does she admit that<br> she told a nun there...<br> - that she was the tsar's daughter.<br> - What does she admit?<br> - Nothing. I think she may be lying.<br> - Then why do you believe...<br> But the important thing<br> is that properly used,<br> she may serve our purpose.<br> - How?<br> - She has certain surprising features.<br> - Such as?<br> - You will see.<br> She also has a rather<br> intriguing strangeness.<br> Of course, that may be<br> simply the result of amnesia.<br> Him and his surprises.<br> If he were looking for a grand duke...<br> - he wouldn't find so many.<br> - Stepan!<br> Bring her in,<br> ? [Woman Singing]<br> - Come over here.<br> - [Slamming]<br> Don't worry.<br> These two gentlemen are friends.<br> Here, Sit down,<br> How about a glass of vodka?<br> It'll do you good.<br> Thank you.<br> There's nothing to fear.<br> They merely want to examine you.<br> Examine? Are they doctors?<br> - They don't help.<br> - Doctors? No.<br> - They are not doctors.<br> - No, no, We should have<br> kept the redhead,<br> The tsar's daughter<br> drinks like a cossack.<br> - May I have a cigarette?<br> - Sure. Here.<br> ? [Woman Continues Singing<br> In Russian]<br> - Where am I?<br> - I told you. With friends.<br> - Strange,<br> - What?<br> - The resemblance to the other.<br> - Yes. Both female.<br> Have you gentlemen considered<br> what she went through?<br> The streets, probably.<br> I can imagine her walk.<br> - Stand up.<br> - What did you say?<br> Ho, ho, ho!<br> I said, "Stand up."<br> We would like to see you walk<br> over to there, if you please.<br> Mm, no. At least with the redhead,<br> we could have dyed her hair.<br> But a walk? The grand duchesses<br> learned with books on their heads.<br> - You could recognize them<br> by their carriage alone,<br> - [Audience Applauding]<br> Oh. Stone walls.<br> - [Chernov]<br> What's she talking about?<br> - Chernov?<br> That bookkeeper who nearly<br> ruined you twelve years ago<br> in the forgery affair...<br> Would you recognixe<br> his walk today?<br> Would you recognixe the smile<br> of a girl you knew ten years ago?<br> - I didn't think of that.<br> - You are both fools.<br> You're examining her as if<br> she was the real Anastasia.<br> There is no Anastasia.<br> She was shot to death ten years ago<br> by a firing squad.<br> We're not looking for her,<br> gentlemen.<br> We're seeking only<br> a reasonable facsimile.<br> Reasonable, yes.<br> But that is unreasonable.<br> - [Petrovin]<br> Please, Let's be constructive,<br> - What will the committee say?<br> - Most of them have seen the original.<br> - How?<br> At a court ball, from a balcony?<br> In church, by candlelight,<br> flickering shadows?<br> Yes, you saw her.<br> Many saw her. From a distance.<br> - Or in the newspapers.<br> - What about the servants?<br> Some of them are here in exile.<br> They saw her through devoted tears,<br> and they will again.<br> - All right, and the family...<br> - The family? If it was<br> the immediate family...<br> I would not try it...<br> but they are dead.<br> And do you have faith in the memories<br> of uncles, aunts, cousins?<br> - I don't.<br> - You have faith in nothing.<br> They will closet themselves<br> in their bedrooms, and secretly<br> peer at yellow photographs...<br> - which that woman will resemble.<br> - That?<br> Yes, that. Rouge will turn<br> the mouth up a bit.<br> Some powder, a new coiffure.<br> Dresses to suggest<br> the other period.<br> Walk, manner, voice<br> taught along with faces, names, places.<br> [Laughing] It would be easier if we<br> could present her to the committee...<br> - lying in her coffin.<br> - Yes, no questions,<br> no answers, no mistakes.<br> - No money, either.<br> - I know. Now I know!<br> - Know what?<br> - It's a cellar. You brought me<br> down here to shoot me!<br> - Are you mad? This is absurd.<br> - It's a cellar!<br> - Sit down. Sit down, I said!<br> - No!<br> - [Gasping]<br> - [Chernov, Laughing]<br> Pretty good, pretty good,<br> - A little more rehearsal, perhaps.<br> - What?<br> He told her how the real one<br> was shot in a cellar and instructed...<br> Don't be stupid,<br> I told her nothing,<br> The woman can undoubtedly read.<br> And certainly, enough has been written<br> describing their death in the cellar.<br> - Some say she did not die.<br> - Huh? Where did you get that?<br> He just said so: From a book,<br> or a story I was told.<br> - A rumor, a whisper.<br> - Or it happened.<br> It did not, and that woman<br> is too... too something.<br> Too craxy, too clever,<br> too tricky.<br> I don't care what she is.<br> The important thing is that she fits.<br> Get up. Go over there.<br> - What is it?<br> - Just a drawing. Stand closer.<br> Turn around.<br> - The correct height.<br> - [Scoffs] "The correct height!"<br> Yes. The crown might<br> belong on her head.<br> A drawing of whom?<br> Who is it?<br> A princess. A Russian<br> grand duchess who died in 1918.<br> A princess!<br> [Laughing]<br> G...<br> [Coughing]<br> Petrovin, a glass of water.<br> - It's all right.<br> - It's all right, Petrovin.<br> Her Highness is better.<br> - Don't call me that!<br> - How well you hear.<br> And how well you know how to use<br> what you hear, and when.<br> It was you who told the nun that<br> you were the Grand Duchess Anastasia.<br> - Sick people get sick ideas.<br> - Then you were in that<br> asylum in St. Cloud.<br> And before that, in Berlin.<br> - Let me out of here!<br> - You know you were.<br> You were and you weren't,<br> and why and why not?<br> Questions like that<br> can only be answered by lies.<br> - Let me go, let me go!<br> - Stop it! Stop it!<br> [Gasps]<br> No. No. Please.<br> Please, don't. Don't!<br> - Look at her hand. Go on, look.<br> - [Petrovin] What?<br> Well, he wants us to look.<br> All right. Come.<br> Now, come under the light.<br> Sit down.<br> Open your hands.<br> I told you there were<br> surprising features.<br> - On the palm of each hand, a scar.<br> - As from bullets.<br> Now, look at her head.<br> Above the left temple.<br> A narrow depression, extending<br> almost to the forehead.<br> - Just as we were told.<br> - Where did you get those scars?<br> A gift from an unknown admirer.<br> - Where?<br> - I don't remember.<br> Wounds like that<br> and you don't remember?<br> - Huh! Who are you?<br> - No one.<br> - Who are your parents?<br> - None.<br> - Where are you from?<br> - The river.<br> - Before that?<br> - A madhouse.<br> - And before that?<br> - Another river, and another madhouse.<br> Oh, come on now.<br> Who are you?<br> - You tell me.<br> - You must be someone!<br> - Why?<br> - [Scoffs] Nobody, nothing, no one!<br> - Incredible.<br> - But most convenient for us.<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> Come over here, Add up the facts,<br> One: She has a certain resemblance,<br> which we can heighten.<br> Two: She's obviously smart enough<br> to learn what we teach.<br> Discrepancies in her memory can be<br> attributed to the head wound.<br> Three: She has<br> no identity whatsoever.<br> Which means it will be<br> exceedingly difficult for anyone<br> to prove she's someone else.<br> - Four... precisely.<br> - We have eight days.<br> All in favor of the candidate...<br> two to one, elected.<br> [Laughs]<br> Two to one elected.<br> Do you realixe there are<br> 10 million at stake?<br> - Ten million?<br> - Yes, my dear.<br> The inheritance of 10 million...<br> left by the tsar<br> in the Bank of England!<br> And you want to risk it all<br> on a madwoman.<br> I must still be in the asylum...<br> with the one who sat covered<br> and crouched on the floor<br> because she wasn't born yet.<br> It's you who are mad!<br> I'll have no part of this.<br> Now, now, my dear,<br> The carriage of the head<br> not quite so high,<br> Grand duchesses are proud,<br> but also modest.<br> - They are to be killed, not to be sold.<br> - There you are!<br> Mad as a hatter! Now she<br> really thinks she is Anastasia.<br> - I do not! I am not.<br> - But you can be.<br> - I can make you Anastasia.<br> - She is dead. You said so.<br> - That doesn't matter.<br> - Please, please. No one will believe it.<br> - The family. They'll call the lie.<br> - No matter, they will accept you.<br> For 10 million, gladly.<br> They would accept me, and<br> pretend to love me for money?<br> - Is that what they are like?<br> No. I'm going.<br> - Isn't everyone?<br> - Where? To the river or the madhouse?<br> - You have no papers,<br> The police will<br> pick you up soon enough.<br> - If you don't die of starvation sooner.<br> - Oh, come, come.<br> Why then did you tell<br> those stories in the hospital?<br> To the little nun?<br> Her eyes grew big as a child's.<br> But then, in the evening,<br> she brought me special things to eat.<br> - An orange, or some grapes.<br> - We can bring you much more.<br> But in another hospital<br> I told other stories,<br> and they believed them, too.<br> Especially the one<br> where the train blew up.<br> We were too close<br> to where the mine was planted...<br> so when the train hit it,<br> pieces of metal fell like<br> a shower of fireworks...<br> all about us.<br> The man beside me was killed,<br> and the man beside him, too.<br> But I was only wounded.<br> Oh. So that's how<br> you got those scars.<br> Yes, so it would seem.<br> I thought<br> you couldn't remember.<br> - [Audience Applauding]<br> - L-I can't, always. Things come and go.<br> - Like waves of mist.<br> - But look, to be her is<br> what you want, what we want.<br> Even what<br> the royal family wants.<br> So I've heard before. All of it.<br> Say this, remember that.<br> You are, you are not.<br> I know you, I don't know you...<br> - Oh, I've heard it many times.<br> - Where?<br> - Bucharest, Berlin...<br> - Berlin?<br> China, I don't remember!<br> But the enthusiasm and<br> the promises, those I remember.<br> And then<br> when memory failed:<br> Disappointment, anger, dismissal!<br> [Sobbing] Out in the street,<br> failure, fake, nobody!<br> There you're wrong. There will not<br> be failure this time. Not with me.<br> Now, listen. You want to know<br> who you are, don't you?<br> [Softly]<br> Oh, yes.<br> You want to find the family<br> to whom you belong, don't you?<br> Yes, yes.<br> By yourself, you are lost.<br> But with me, you will find yourself.<br> Oh, please, l...<br> I'm tired.<br> You know I am right. The album.<br> Take the chance!<br> It's the only one you have.<br> Oh, I'm too tired to argue.<br> You don't have to do anything.<br> I will do it all.<br> Now, here. Look.<br> It's you on the deck<br> of your father's yacht.<br> - The Standart?<br> - [Chernov] The Standart?<br> - You know the name?<br> - It's written on the lifeboat.<br> Oh, yes. Now, here you are<br> with your family:<br> Your father the tsar,<br> your mother, your sisters,<br> your little brother.<br> - My family.<br> - And here.<br> Look.<br> the House of Romanov. 300 years.<br> There they are on the balcony<br> of the Winter Palace:<br> And that little girl, there...<br> - that is you.<br> - [Petrovin] Thousands kneeling,<br> Singing, "God Save the Tsar."<br> - The people. Your people.<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> - You can see it, can't you?<br> - Yes, I can.<br> And now, may I present your staff:<br> Boris Andreivich Chernov.<br> Formerly of St. Petersburg.<br> Banker.<br> Piotr Ivanovich Petrovin. Former<br> student of the theological seminary.<br> Sergei Pavlovich Bounine...<br> General of the Tcherkess Regiment,<br> former aide-de-camp...<br> attached to the person of<br> His Imperial Majesty, Nicholas II...<br> Tsar of all Russia.<br> Then l...<br> I am Her Imperial Highness...<br> the Grand Duchess<br> Anastasia Nicolaevna.<br> [Laughing, Hysterical]<br> [Sobbing]<br> - [Knocking]<br> - [Bounine] Now, once more,<br> - [Knocking]<br> - [Bounine] Now, once more,<br> "Awakened in the middle of the night<br> and taken down to the cellar,<br> - "And then, without warning..."<br> - "...guards appeared in the doorway...<br> "and began firing.<br> - One fainted, shielded<br> by the body of her sister."<br> - Which sister?<br> - Was it Olga?<br> - Right.<br> Yes. A white dress.<br> Then darkness.<br> "One of the executioners<br> crashed down with his rifle,<br> "Later, two brothers were among<br> the guards that came into the cellar...<br> "to remove the dead.<br> - "One of the bodies moved.<br> - Hers.<br> "Hidden in a farm cart<br> under straw...<br> "wrapped in sheets<br> filled with snow for her fever.<br> "They fled across the country...<br> bribed guards with jewels<br> sewn into her blouse."<br> - Skirt.<br> - Was it?<br> - "And they made their way to..."<br> - [Sighs]<br> - I don't know. Balta.<br> - Balta.<br> And from there<br> across the Romanian border to...<br> - [Sighs]<br> - Bucharest.<br> - And there?<br> - There?<br> There she died of heartbreak...<br> and was thrown into the sea...<br> to the strains of<br> an old Russian waltx.<br> It was all quite good<br> up to the end.<br> This icon. You're supposed<br> to have seen it before.<br> - Remember? Where was it?<br> - In my mother's bedroom.<br> She was very religious, and she<br> placed holy pictures everywhere.<br> - Right.<br> - And books, and albums...<br> just like these, scattered about,<br> overflowing the tables.<br> There was a sitting room between<br> the bedroom of my mother and my fa...<br> Oh, no, that was that little reading<br> room in the hospital. How silly.<br> - More coffee? She won't sleep.<br> - She hasn't got time.<br> I don't very much anyway,<br> but thank you.<br> - [Door Closes]<br> - All right.<br> - Where were we? Oh, yes. Your mother.<br> - [Bounine] Don't get excited,<br> But I know what I'm talking about!<br> We have exactly three days left.<br> Let us worry about<br> one thing at a time.<br> [Grumbling]<br> One thing at a time.<br> - All right, Piotr Ivanovich,<br> I'll take over.<br> - I think she's very tired.<br> No, I've had my coffee.<br> Besides, it all helps<br> to bring my memory back.<br> And maybe one memory<br> will convince someone.<br> Even if it's only me.<br> Where did you live<br> in the winter?<br> - The Winter Palace, St. Petersburg.<br> - Right, Spring?<br> Spring?<br> I don't remember.<br> - Tsarskoie Selo.<br> - Tsarskoie Selo.<br> - Summer?<br> - Peterhof.

The committee<br> will not give us even one more day.<br> - You think she's ready?<br> - [Sighs] No.<br> - Of course, she thinks she is.<br> - Oh! Listen, she thinks she's Anastasia.<br> And the great Stanislavski once said,<br> when an actor believes he is...<br> - the character he's playing, fire him.<br> - It's a bit late for that.<br> It's a bit late for anything.<br> The eight days are finished.<br> The play is finished.<br> We are finished.<br> - The play is merely being<br> replaced by a pantomime.<br> - Huh?<br> Our leading lady will be very weak,<br> exhausted, too sick to talk.<br> - [Disgusted Groaning]<br> - With careful staging,<br> the committee will be satisfied.<br> And careful casting. Her Imperial<br> Highness will be too weak...<br> to see any more than,<br> let us say, six members.<br> - Why six?<br> - Three stupid enough to accept<br> even you as Anastasia...<br> three important enough<br> to spread the news that<br> she is Anastasia.<br> Your Highness, may I present<br> a few members of our colony here...<br> who, as I told you are anxious<br> to see you for just a moment.<br> His Excellency,<br> Count Ilia Feodorovich Bechmetieff...<br> and his brother,<br> Count Andreikovich Bechmetieff.<br> His Excellency,<br> Court Assessor Schischkin.<br> - Schischkin.<br> - What?<br> Your Imperial Highness.<br> - [Bounine]<br> His Excellency, Von Drivnitz,<br> - [Coughing]<br> - It's very rude to stare.<br> - Forgive me.<br> Difficult to say.<br> [Bounine]<br> Madame de Lissenskaia,<br> Come closer. No.<br> You, please.<br> I think I know you. Were you not<br> a lady-in-waiting to my mother?<br> Many people know that,<br> I'm afraid.<br> I'm trying to remember more.<br> When I was a child, I used to watch<br> the faces of the ladies-in-waiting...<br> to see if they were wearing lip rouge...<br> my mother did not allow makeup, so l...<br> I was not mean, just...<br> just mischievous.<br> I used to report to her.<br> What was it my mother<br> used to call you?<br> Shura? No. Zina.<br> I'm sorry, it escaped my...<br> Nini. Yes, Nini.<br> [Weeping] Your Highness!<br> Your Imperial Highness!<br> [Continues Sobbing]<br> - What's the matter?<br> Don't you like my borscht?<br> - No.<br> Too bad. The General says<br> you have to eat it.<br> - She won't eat!<br> - All right, go.<br> This entire household, everything has<br> been turned upside down just for you.<br> To make you comfortable,<br> to help you get well.<br> - I don't like borscht.<br> - I don't care whether<br> you like it or not. Eat it.<br> I specifically warned you not to say<br> one word to that committee.<br> You could have ruined everything.<br> - I told you about Nini, didn't I?<br> - Maybe, I don't know.<br> Yes, I did, or Petrovin did,<br> or you overheard us.<br> But the important thing...<br> Are you angry because you're<br> beginning to wonder who I am?<br> Or because you want me to do<br> nothing except what you tell me?<br> I know who you are not, just as I know<br> that unless you do as I tell you...<br> I'll have an extra<br> cigarette girl at my club.<br> We now have a breathing spell<br> we need badly.<br> You still have a great deal to learn<br> to achieve what we have agreed.<br> Understand?<br> Yes, I understand,<br> Excellency.<br> Then finish your dinner and get to bed.<br> Work begins again in the morning.<br> - And now, royal etiquette.<br> - All right? One.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> A queen.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - A prince of royal blood.<br> - Your Highness.<br> - A prince of ordinary station<br> outside of the royal family.<br> Prince, I suppose, or Your Excellency.<br> [Sighs Sharply]<br> - Cabinet ministers of...<br> - This is absurd!<br> - Even Anna Koreff would know all of it.<br> - Pick up the book.<br> - But why do I need it?<br> - Pick up the book.<br> Put it on your head,<br> and walk over there.<br> You don't seem to realixe<br> that the gesture, the grace...<br> - the carriage of<br> a true daughter of a tsar...<br> ...cannot be taught.<br> Either she learns as a child<br> how to hold herself,<br> or it's too late, Excellency.<br> ?? [Scales]<br> - Did she like to play as a child?<br> - No.<br> - But your mother wanted you to.<br> - I still don't like it.<br> My hands don't have<br> the strength anymore.<br> All right, we can use<br> that as an explanation.<br> But listen to this.<br> Now, this is important.<br> Your tutor wanted you to learn this,<br> to prove to your mother...<br> - ?? [Classical]<br> - That the lessons were not in vain.<br> Did I ever learn it?<br> Yes, but you hated it.<br> ? Mm, mm, mm?<br> ?? [Humming Continues]<br> I like it now.<br> It's quite pretty,<br> ? [Phonograph]<br> Now around. That's it.<br> Once more.<br> - ? [Ends]<br> - All right. Now the Polonaise.<br> - [Sighs] Can't I rest?<br> - Yes, after dinner. Here we go.<br> - I can't!<br> - You will. Head up.<br> Back straight.<br> One, two, three.<br> - ? ["The Polonaise'"]<br> - One, two, three, one, two, three.<br> - Please.<br> - Please concentrate.<br> - And one, two, three, one, two, three...<br> - My feet hurt. I can't anymore.<br> - A little rest.<br> - There is no time.<br> The waltx, Petrovin. Come on.<br> I'm sure you won't mind doing this.<br> This is the waltx you like so much.<br> The back, the back.<br> With ease, style...<br> ?? [Waltx]<br> Didn't you say the other day<br> it reminded you of something?<br> Yes, of my first boy.<br> - And your first love, no doubt.<br> - Yes.<br> - Who was he?<br> - I can't remember.<br> Was he fair, or was he<br> dark with a mustache?<br> I don't know. One day<br> he's fair, the next he's dark.<br> I don't know.<br> One, two, three, one, two, three,<br> one, two, three, one, two, three.<br> [Gasping]<br> [Crying Out]<br> [Screaming]<br> ? [Piano Cadenza]<br> - ?? [Ends]<br> - [Sobbing]<br> [Door Closing]<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - [Sobbing] Oh, I can't anymore.<br> I don't know who I am anymore.<br> I don't know what I remember,<br> and what I've been told I remember.<br> - What is real? Am I?<br> - Anna...<br> Anna. Am I Anna?<br> Why not Tamara, why not Lisa?<br> Why not Tatiana?<br> Yes, why not Tatiana?<br> I can't anymore.<br> I want to be me, whoever I am.<br> I want to be me! I want someone<br> to tell me, someone to accept me.<br> You have been working very hard,<br> and you're overtired.<br> - But we're almost finished now.<br> - Are you?<br> - Well, then you know who I am?<br> - A good night's sleep...<br> - But you must know. You must!<br> - Just go to bed.<br> - No, I'm leaving! I'm leaving! L...<br> - Stop it!<br> - [Sniffling]<br> - Go to bed at once!<br> My father was very strict.<br> I did not like to obey,<br> but he was ringmaster in a circus.<br> General Bounine?<br> - Yes?<br> - Who am I?<br> I don't know.<br> - ? [Waltz]<br> - [Footman] Excellencies<br> Countess Iliana Petrovna,,,<br> - ? [Waltz]<br> - [Footman] Excellencies<br> Countess Iliana Petrovna,,,<br> - and Prince Tigantseff,<br> - My dear madame!<br> Her Highness and the general<br> will be here shortly.<br> May I thank you again<br> for all of us for what you're doing.<br> Oh, I should not be thanked.<br> It makes me happy to do anything<br> that will help restore...<br> - what is rightfully...<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh, Excellency!<br> - [Footman Announces Another Guest]<br> I cannot tell you how important<br> your presence is here today.<br> My dear Irina, I promised your<br> late father I'd keep an eye on you.<br> And occasionally,<br> it's a little trying.<br> I promise you will not<br> regret coming.<br> That's a promise you may<br> have some difficulty in keeping.<br> - May I sit down?<br> - Oh, do, please.<br> - This abominable gout.<br> - This way.<br> Albert, a chair for His Excellency.<br> Take care of His Excellency.<br> You know how he is.<br> - Baron and Baroness Royalvich,<br> - The old fox himself.<br> - I never thought he would come.<br> - Well...<br> we may wish he hadn't.<br> - How many are you taking?<br> - [Clears Throat]<br> - People will think you're hungry.<br> - Hungry? [Chuckling]<br> I'm not hungry, I'm nervous.<br> No, thank you.<br> [Footman]<br> His Excellency, Count Marzumov,<br> - Xenia!<br> - Grischa!<br> I must say,<br> a truly wonderful occasion!<br> - Yes. Red caviar.<br> - What?<br> - You mean...<br> - Yes.<br> - If the caviar were real...<br> ...she would be real.<br> - [Footman Announcing Guest]<br> - Vasilli Dimitrovich, please remain<br> here, Your Excellency.<br> - Hmm?<br> - [Louder] Remain here!<br> We will see that they come to you!<br> - I understand. So many dear old faces.<br> - Ah, yes.<br> - And it is their<br> dear old names we want...<br> - Hmm?<br> We want their names<br> on signed statements that will<br> convince the Bank of England...<br> - Yes! Yes!<br> - Yes, yes, convince...<br> [Footman] Her Imperial Highness,<br> the Grand Duchess Anastasia,<br> - This way, Your Highness.<br> Close by the alcove.<br> - Stepan.<br> My dear general,<br> this is all so exciting.<br> Your Imperial Highness, please.<br> So, Piotr Ivanovich, here we go.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends...<br> - Oh, I would like to say<br> a few words, but,,,<br> - Too much. She's doing too much.<br> It is very difficult<br> for me to speak today.<br> General Bounine,<br> would you, please?<br> As you all know, I am the last one to<br> believe in miracles or resurrections.<br> But reality cannot be<br> established without help.<br> Legal help. Witnessed<br> and signed statements.<br> It is frankly our hope,<br> and our need...<br> that those among you who believe will<br> come forward after the reception...<br> and sign these testimonials<br> voluntarily.<br> Now, I am quite sure...<br> that some of you have<br> come here to obstruct.<br> The reasons... political, monetary...<br> we all know,<br> There are some who have been made<br> understandably cynical by the revolution,<br> And there are some who will testify<br> to anyone, and anything, and have,<br> To none of you do we bring<br> any pressure.<br> To all of you we bring<br> someone who has literally suffered<br> worse than death for ten lost years.<br> It is our duty to restore<br> this extraordinary person<br> to the world of the living.<br> If you are sentimental, say it is<br> because she has suffered enough.<br> If you are humane,<br> say justice must be done.<br> If you are Russian, a loyal subject<br> of His late Majesty, then say with me:<br> Our only hope is his daughter...<br> Her Imperial Highness,<br> Anastasia Nicolaevna.<br> Her Excellency,<br> Countess Baranova,<br> Your Highness. When Irina...<br> When Madame de Lissenskaia told me...<br> I confess I really had doubts.<br> You can understand.<br> - It really is a miracle,<br> - Is it?<br> - Yes, Your Highness. We met only once...<br> - I remember.<br> - Near the tennis courts at Livadia.<br> - Yes!<br> I remember that my uncle Alex got you<br> the title because he liked dancing.<br> But from then on, you made a fool<br> of him. My mother never liked you.<br> My father never liked you<br> and I never liked you. Please go.<br> - Now just a moment.<br> You're not Anastasia yet...<br> - I said, please go.<br> You are mad. Don't answer.<br> But I warn you for the last time.<br> - [Groaning]<br> - Your Excellency, you're not leaving...<br> - without seeing Her Highness.<br> - I have seen her.<br> But she will be so disappointed<br> at not having seen you again.<br> - And how do you know that?<br> - Huh? You mean, how do l...<br> Uh, well, uh...<br> Truthfully, Excellency, we don't,<br> but we are sure she will.<br> - We are sure, Excellency.<br> - And I! Dear Ivan Wassielevich,<br> you stayed this long...<br> - and after all, you did promise me...<br> - Now, don't wheedle, Irina.<br> - Oh, all right. But don't keep me<br> there too long. My foot hurts.<br> - Excellency.<br> I think you are<br> due for a surprise.<br> - His Excellency...<br> - I am so glad to see you,<br> Ivan Wassielevich.<br> - They told you my name. How kind.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> No, thank you.<br> I don't expect to stay.<br> My father's chamberlain<br> was a man of great courtesy.<br> His Majesty complimented me<br> on many things.<br> I don't recall<br> his mentioning courtesy.<br> My father's chamberlain<br> was also a temperate man,<br> who did not judge before...<br> Madame, forgive me,<br> I've a miserable attack of gout,,,<br> undoubtedly a punishment<br> for being intemperate.<br> And I'm eager to return<br> to my tub of hot water.<br> There are many characteristics<br> which you could recall...<br> many details, but<br> so could doxens of others.<br> My relations with His Majesty's<br> children were impersonal, public,<br> So in the end, myjudgment could<br> only be a matter of opinion,,,<br> and that opinion can only be<br> determined by resemblance and manner.<br> Your Excellency,<br> ten years is a long time.<br> No, I've already<br> noted the resemblance.<br> As to the manner,<br> I've been watching.<br> And you have given me pleasure.<br> You've taken me back to my seat...<br> in the Imperial Theater<br> at St. Petersburg.<br> Second row on the aisle,<br> every Tuesday night.<br> For the purpose of acting<br> is not only to imitate reality,,,<br> but to create illusion,<br> I'm not being sarcastic when I say<br> you are an excellent actress, Madame.<br> Extremely well trained.<br> My compliments.<br> - I do not accept them.<br> - Madame, my foot is troubling me.<br> My life is troubling me,<br> and it has yet to be lived.<br> You do not believe because<br> you do not wish to believe.<br> You say my words will not<br> convince because you're afraid<br> I know the right words.<br> You misquote, Madame. I said<br> that the manner, the deportment<br> of a grand duchess...<br> would convince me, but...<br> [Scoffing]<br> I don't see it in you.<br> Not a gesture.<br> Though one would be worth<br> more than all the words<br> you undoubtedly can produce.<br> Good day, Madame.<br> How dare you smoke in my presence<br> without my permission?<br> Who are you?<br> Fifteen, 16, 17, 18.<br> Out of a possible 31.<br> And you were so sure it would<br> be almost a clean sweep!<br> Didn't the old fox himself say<br> her performance was great art?<br> We're not doing this for art,<br> we're doing it for money!<br> Now listen,<br> this can go on forever!<br> - Some saying she is,<br> some saying she isn't.<br> - Precisely.<br> - My mind is made up.<br> - Oh? To what?<br> There's only one way:<br> To go straight to the top.<br> - You mean, the old icon?<br> - Yes, the dowager empress.<br> Sure, the old ramrod sits in her castle<br> in Copenhagen biting her nails...<br> because she's waiting<br> for Sarah Bernhardt here<br> to give her performance.<br> She's the one chance.<br> As head of the family, no one<br> would dare dispute her word.<br> - "Dispute her word."<br> - Excellency, Her Highness<br> would like to see you.<br> - Her what? She can wait.<br> - Isn't she?<br> Not too long.<br> She's packing up.<br> Packing up?<br> - And where's Her Highness going?<br> - I don't know, and it doesn't matter.<br> - I thought you enjoyed yourself today.<br> - Yes, until I became ashamed.<br> Ashamed of allowing myself<br> to be put on display.<br> Ashamed of conjuring up tricks<br> like a circus freak.<br> Ashamed of asking people<br> to sign papers that I'm real.<br> I am real, and I will not<br> stoop to prove it to them.<br> - Who are they? I think I know.<br> - Who are you?<br> Today? And tomorrow?<br> Will you be so sure tomorrow,<br> and the day after?<br> Why? Why can't you<br> let me believe?<br> I will even help you believe,<br> when I'm sure of the truth myself.<br> No one will ever be sure, and you<br> least of all. I know that today, too.<br> Wrong. Those people today<br> were not worth your efforts.<br> But there is someone who is.<br> One word from her<br> and they will all grovel.<br> - The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna.<br> - Grandmama.<br> - Grandma-MA.<br> - Grandma-MA.<br> - She'll never see me.<br> - She will.<br> - How do you know? Words!<br> - I know she will.<br> Call me schemer, plotter,<br> call me what you will.<br> Deep down you know that if anyone can<br> get you to see that old woman, it is I.<br> - And I'll get you there for your sake.<br> - For my sake?<br> - Yes.<br> - You never did anything for the<br> sake of anybody but yourself.<br> You enjoy playing with people,<br> making fools of them.<br> That's why you're doing it, as a joke!<br> To prove that you are great, and alive...<br> and the others<br> are small and dead.<br> Yes, and for money...<br> Go ahead.<br> It won't hurt.<br> Sit down.<br> If you want to leave after I am through,<br> I won't force you to stay.<br> Let us say you are right.<br> As a matter of fact, you are.<br> That's all the more reason for you to go<br> with me to the empress in Copenhagen.<br> Never trust anyone who functions from<br> noble motives. The good are never sure.<br> And in the end,<br> they'll let you down,<br> Our motives are different, agreed.<br> But our goal is the same,<br> And that's the only thing that counts,<br> Well?<br> We'll go to Copenhagen?<br> - I had a dream the other night.<br> - Yes. About your father<br> being a ringmaster.<br> No. This time<br> he was a doll maker.<br> My mother, his assistant<br> who painted the faces.<br> The correct ancestry<br> for a puppet.<br> You know I'll go.<br> You always know.<br> [Whistle Shrieking]<br> She always wore black,<br> the empress, didn't she?<br> Yes.<br> For ten years,<br> I've wanted to see her.<br> - She was never very easy,<br> even before the end.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> You know,<br> or you remember?<br> Prince Paul. Let's see.<br> Nephew to the empress,<br> second cousin to me...<br> - engaged to me when I was... how old?<br> - Sixteen.<br> Quite attractive.<br> - Do you remember him?<br> - No.<br> You should. I'll tell you a secret,<br> that first waltx you remember...<br> - [Knocking On Door]<br> - It was with him.<br> - Danish customs.<br> Have you anything to declare?<br> - No.<br> Madame. Thank you.<br> - Madame Anderson. Madame Anderson!<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Oh, yes. Bounine.<br> Everything in order?<br> Yes, it seems to be.<br> Welcome to Denmark.<br> I hope you enjoy your visit.<br> - Thank you.<br> - [Whistle Shrieking]<br> - [Door Closes]<br> - I'm sorry, I forgot.<br> - I've had so many names.<br> - It was a struggle to get you that one.<br> - Why Anderson?<br> - Oh, well you needed some name...<br> - and once I was in a situation with...<br> - With a lady?<br> Well, as an alias,<br> it is innocuous enough.<br> "Madame A. Anderson."<br> The least real thing about me<br> is my legal reality.<br> What happened to<br> the other Madame Anderson?<br> - Oh, nothing very important.<br> - Just got tired of her?<br> - [Whistle Shrieks]<br> - This visa is good for only 14 days.<br> Two weeks. Most people have<br> a lifetime in which to be accepted.<br> - Suppose two weeks are not enough.<br> - They must be.<br> [Coughs]<br> ?? [March]<br> - What's that for?<br> - In the cavalry, we used to do it...<br> when we saw<br> the infantry marching.<br> - Driver, what is this parade?<br> - Nothing special.<br> We have it every day<br> the king is here in Copenhagen.<br> Thank you. The king?<br> - Uncle Chris.<br> Cousin to Grandmama, the empress.<br> - Good. Very good.<br> [Bicycle Bells Ringing]<br> Excuse me, sir,<br> - Will you see Mrs. Anderson<br> to her rooms, please?<br> - Yes.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> Where is the bar?<br> That way, sir.<br> - Well?<br> - Not good.<br> - Uh-uh.<br> The empress absolutely refuses<br> to see you, let alone her.<br> - And him?<br> - [Chuckling]<br> No. Our Prince Paul lives<br> on the old lady's allowance.<br> He was always<br> rather courageous.<br> One possibility. Remember<br> Baroness von Livenbaum?<br> That craxy lady-in-waiting<br> of the empress?<br> - Mm, vaguely.<br> - She remembers you clearly.<br> Uh, just a moment. You have a rendexvous<br> with her tomorrow at 4:00.<br> - Rendexvous?<br> - Yes.<br> - At the Tivoli Gardens,<br> - ? [Trumpet Fanfare]<br> ? [Fades]<br> It isn't! It can't be!<br> - It is!<br> - Elena von Livenbaum.<br> - Sergei Bounine.<br> - Do sit down.<br> Thank you...<br> No, it's too dangerous.<br> - But I will.<br> - Dangerous? Come.<br> Whom could we possibly run into<br> here at Tivoli, except children?<br> That's exactly why I chose it.<br> How fit you look.<br> Superb. But this is a stiflingly<br> small town... a village.<br> A hundred chattering tongues<br> will go gossiping to Her Majesty...<br> "Your lady-in-waiting<br> was seen with that man."<br> - That man. [Chuckling]<br> A flagon of your delicious beer.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> I always drink what the natives drink.<br> Ah, this is madness without the moon.<br> My dear Baroness,<br> you will never change.<br> Now you're trying to bribe me,<br> just as the empress said you would.<br> - Where is she?<br> - The empress?<br> She's playing solitaire,<br> with her memories.<br> No, dear General, Anastasia.<br> Or should I say, "Her Highness"?<br> Is it really she?<br> - I'd love to meet her.<br> - And so you shall.<br> As soon as she is properly<br> introduced to Copenhagen.<br> What a look you have.<br> How inevitable that<br> I am useless to you.<br> - Why?<br> - The empress will never<br> receive you, or that woman.<br> You know her. An "unmeltable" icicle.<br> Uh, thank you.<br> And you won't get at her<br> through Paul, either.<br> He sends her his bills as though<br> they were invitations.<br> He behaves as though we were<br> still in Russia. Russia!<br> I am all of Chekhov's<br> three sisters rolled into one.<br> - I shall never get back there.<br> - Surely you must have a pleasant<br> life with the empress here.<br> With Her Majesty, life<br> is one eternal glass of milk.<br> - Oh, come.<br> There must be some court life.<br> - Not a crumb!<br> - She never entertains?<br> - Her phantoms.<br> The ghosts of her dead family.<br> But she must go out for a drive.<br> Or shopping. Or a museum.<br> If you ever speak, whisper,<br> breathe one word...<br> Well, she does go out occasionally,<br> if there's anything Russian.<br> An opera or a ballet.<br> Let me see.<br> They're performing a ballet<br> ofTchaikovsky's this week<br> at the Royal Theater.<br> Thursday, I believe.<br> ?? [Tchaikovsky, "Sleeping Beauty"]<br> Come over here for a moment.<br> I want you to look<br> as beautiful as possible tonight.<br> - Oh.<br> - He's quite a simple soul,<br> really, Prince Paul.<br> His vocation and avocation<br> are one and the same.<br> The pursuit<br> of beautiful women.<br> If you thought it necessary,<br> I suppose you would even have<br> sent me to a plastic surgeon.<br> - Take your seat.<br> - Do you know how long it is<br> since I've been to a theater?<br> Don't display too much<br> excitement. Sit down.<br> - General, they just arrived.<br> - She too?<br> Yes.<br> - Program.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> Box nearest the stage.<br> - The man you want me<br> to look beautiful for?<br> - Yes.<br> - My fianc?<br> - The lady next to him is<br> Baroness von Livenbaum...<br> lady-in-waiting to the empress.<br> - Where's the empress?<br> - In the back of the box,<br> behind the curtain.<br> So close, after so many years.<br> [Coughs]<br> Oh, I'm suddenly frightened.<br> ? [Crescendo]<br> [Applauding]<br> [Chattering]<br> ? [Mozart,<br> "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'"]<br> Go with them to the buffet,<br> and stand facing this way.<br> - Tonight can mean...<br> - I know what tonight can mean.<br> Go ahead.<br> [Chernov]<br> Uh, please, Three coffees,<br> [Men Chattering]<br> - Good evening, Your Highness.<br> - Oh, Bounine. We were just<br> talking about you.<br> - Good to see you again.<br> - Thank you. When did you return?<br> - Where from?<br> - The hunting trip I was told<br> you were on all week.<br> Oh. My relations with my aunt<br> force me to be on far too many trips.<br> - I apologixe.<br> - I understand.<br> - Who's the lovely lady with you?<br> Extremely lovely.<br> - Mrs. Anderson?<br> - Yes, she's rather pretty.<br> - Anderson? Is she Danish? English?<br> Well, she's many things.<br> Would you like to meet her?<br> You know very well I would.<br> May I present His Highness,<br> Prince Paul von Haraldeberg?<br> Her Imperial Highness,<br> Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicolaevna.<br> - I should have known.<br> - Traveling under the name of<br> Mrs. Anderson.<br> Surprised?<br> I wasn't sure<br> I recognixed you either.<br> - But you are sure now?<br> - Yes.<br> I shall not ask yet<br> whether you are.<br> You're either very kind<br> or very tactful. My compliments.<br> - Will you both excuse me?<br> - You are afraid.<br> As a little boy<br> you always were.<br> Is it such a terrible risk<br> to have a drink with us?<br> It seems that anything<br> with the general is a risk...<br> - Even a drink.<br> - Then have it with me.<br> - Now it is my turn.<br> Will you both excuse me?<br> - Of course.<br> - You have changed.<br> - So have you.<br> Then you do remember?<br> I remember a little girl who used to<br> delight in backing me into a corner.<br> I remember a little boy who always<br> took time to make up his mind.<br> - For example?<br> - Ah. You're testing me?<br> No, prodding you to talk,<br> so I can enjoy looking at you.<br> - Champagne?<br> - Why not?<br> Ah, the Baroness<br> von Livenbaum, please.<br> General Bounine, quelle surprise,<br> Vassili, Her Majesty would like<br> a glass of mineral water.<br> You are a monster.<br> I've survived a revolution,<br> I suppose I can survive this.<br> Will you forgive me<br> if I make sure that Vassili<br> gets the right kind of water?<br> - Her Majesty is madly particular.<br> - Certainly.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Oh.<br> - Your Majesty, forgive me.<br> I did once when<br> I heard you'd been shot.<br> - I was sentenced twice.<br> - By whom, the Whites or the Reds?<br> - As I recall, by both.<br> - Good for them. But you're still here.<br> - I have asked Your Majesty's pardon.<br> - For what? For this intrusion?<br> For the effrontery of using<br> the name of Romanov to launch<br> a commercial enterprise?<br> For hammering<br> at my gate for days?<br> - Your Majesty...<br> - Bounine...<br> I have already been shown<br> two Tatianas, an Alexei, and a Maria...<br> as well as an Anastasia.<br> I will not see your client.<br> I am as weary of these spectral<br> grandchildren as I am of false hope.<br> I have lost everything<br> I have loved.<br> My husband, my family,<br> my position, my country...<br> I have nothing but memories.<br> I want to be left alone with them.<br> Perhaps one memory<br> may be a reality.<br> The only reality for you<br> is an investment.<br> Your Majesty, only a fool<br> would bring you a mere investment.<br> Whatever you may think of me,<br> you must know that I am not a fool.<br> I too have gone through<br> the revolution into the world.<br> The effects of your journey<br> are not visible.<br> You know perfectly well this woman<br> is not my granddaughter.<br> Quite honestly,<br> I don't know who she is.<br> But there is so much that<br> cannot be explained unless<br> she is the woman she believes she is.<br> - I see now that it mattered more<br> to you than I thought.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> You really wanted that title<br> you never got. You're not doing<br> this simply for money.<br> You have never forgiven<br> my family, have you?<br> I'm here simply to tell you<br> that whoever this woman is,<br> she asks only one thing...<br> - To see you.<br> - Unfortunately, there are not<br> enough years remaining for me...<br> to see every madwoman<br> with a royal obsession.<br> If she must see me, show her<br> my photographs again.<br> - Your Majesty...<br> - Go back to Paris, Bounine.<br> You are wasting your time.<br> General, good evening,<br> - Your Majesty,<br> I thought perhaps that you...<br> - Save your nonsense. My cape.<br> So Bounine is still attractive.<br> [Chuckling]<br> Yes, Your Majesty.<br> - Madly attractive.<br> - Yes, Your Majesty.<br> Livenbaum, your voluptuous<br> fancies are disgusting.<br> To a woman of your age,<br> sex should mean nothing but gender.<br> - Yes, Your Majesty.<br> - ? [Orchestra]<br> You saw her?<br> What did she say? Did she...<br> I did not see her.<br> What did he say?<br> He was very charming. I like him<br> much more than I thought I would<br> from your description.<br> - Do you?<br> - Don't you want me to?<br> I want you to make him like you<br> more than he thought he would.<br> - Forgive me, Aunt Marie.<br> I just ran into somebody...<br> - I forgive you.<br> You ran into a blond.<br> Very pretty.<br> Is she married?<br> - And who is she?<br> - I don't know yet.<br> - Go on, you can tell me.<br> - Livenbaum, I came<br> for the other performance.<br> Your Majesty.<br> - The jewels, please.<br> - Jewels?<br> Yes, the jewels.<br> Please, Andrei, will you put<br> these in the safe downstairs?<br> Why? They are fake.<br> - You know that, but the manager won't.<br> - Oh, public relations.<br> - Anything else?<br> - No. See you in the morning. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> You did very well tonight.<br> Thank you.<br> Am I dismissed now too?<br> Yes, you had better<br> get some rest.<br> Prince Paul will be calling<br> for you tomorrow evening.<br> Thank you for achieving<br> the invitation.<br> You achieved it.<br> I merely accepted.<br> The empress doesn't want<br> to see me, does she?<br> - She will see you.<br> - I'm sure she said no tonight.<br> So now the route<br> is through Paul via me.<br> You don't hesitate to use anybody<br> for anything, do you?<br> Oh, I hesitate.<br> I hesitate until I'm sure<br> of the desires of those concerned.<br> Good night.<br> To begin with, a nice,<br> clear champagne soup.<br> And then, uh, I think<br> a fricassee of champagne.<br> - No vegetables.<br> - But a crisp champagne salad.<br> - Excellent.<br> - And for dessert?<br> - A small champagne souffl.<br> - 1921 is a very good year for souffl.<br> I really don't like champagne.<br> I only like what it does to me.<br> - You won't like it in the morning.<br> - Mmm.<br> I'll adore it in the morning. I'll have<br> a fantastically enormous hangover...<br> and your friend Bounine<br> will be furious.<br> You know what he is?<br> Vodka. Quick, hard, sharp.<br> - And you?<br> - Champagne, I hope.<br> - Don't be greedy. Mmm.<br> - As a little girl you used to say that...<br> Oh, no, no.<br> Not tonight.<br> - How many times have<br> we been together? Four, five?<br> - Three.<br> And every time...<br> Well, every time I've heard<br> your mind "click, click, click.<br> Is she? Isn't she? Is sh..."<br> It's very, very unattractive<br> of you, and very noisy.<br> Tonight I just want<br> to have a good time.<br> Do you know who I am?<br> No. A woman.<br> - An extremely attractive one.<br> - Then behave accordingly.<br> Well that's...<br> That's difficult.<br> - No "click, click, click."<br> - Not a one.<br> Excuse me, Your Highness,<br> I apologize for the intrusion,,,<br> but Her Highness has not<br> yet recovered from her illness.<br> Her doctor has given<br> strict orders that she retire early.<br> Vodka, pure vodka.<br> That poor Cinderella. The coach<br> turned back into a pumpkin...<br> - and the footman into a big white rat.<br> - Your Highness.<br> - Don't you think<br> the glass slipper cut her foot?<br> - Good night, Your Highness.<br> Oh, that ugly stepsister!<br> Good night. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> And thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Pleasant dreams.<br> [Giggling]<br> Good evening. Ah...<br> I forgot. My compliments to the chef.<br> [Laughing]<br> - Good night.<br> - May I speak to you for a moment?<br> - It's very late.<br> - It's very important.<br> All right, I enjoy her company.<br> And I agree she's a beautiful woman.<br> With the possibility<br> of inheriting ten million pounds.<br> Bounine, everyone is boringly aware<br> of my weakness, and yours...<br> For beauty and money.<br> I don't think it so inhuman of us.<br> They are the two most desirable<br> items in the world.<br> All right.<br> What do you propose to do?<br> At times you push too hard.<br> Her visa expires in four days.<br> - If she hasn't seen the empress...<br> - You've been knocking too loudly<br> on the door, Bounine.<br> It is precisely when my aunt thinks<br> somebody is trying to force her<br> to do something...<br> - that she does nothing.<br> - When do you do something?<br> - Depends.<br> - On the odds?<br> You're pushing again.<br> They are high this time,<br> my dear prince. Very high.<br> Good night.<br> [Anna]<br> One, two...<br> Three, four...<br> General...<br> General, I'm hungry,<br> You just came from<br> a restaurant, didn't you?<br> Oh, but, but such<br> a funny restaurant,<br> No food! Why don't you<br> take me there tomorrow?<br> [Bounine]<br> You've had too much to drink,<br> [Anna] No! Not quite enough,<br> Shall I call for some more?<br> - No!<br> - "No! '"It must be very dreary<br> in your room,<br> Everyone in mine<br> is having a wonderful time,<br> [Anna Giggles]<br> Would you care tojoin us?<br> [Bounine] Please stop the nonsense<br> and go to sleep,<br> [Anna, Singsong] Go to sleep,<br> When we sleep, we sleep,<br> General, I have<br> a confession to make:<br> I was lying,<br> There's no one here but me,<br> Can you hear me? General!<br> Why don't you<br> make a concession?<br> Uh, I mean confession.<br> Well, it's the same thing,<br> Come on, General,<br> One little confession,<br> One sweet tiny confession,<br> ? [Humming]<br> Prince Paul was asking<br> for you twice, Your Majesty.<br> Thank you, Fedya.<br> Good afternoon, Your Majesty.<br> Did Her Majesty enjoy the drive?<br> Yes, it was quiet for a change.<br> - Prince Paul...<br> - I heard. He called twice.<br> He's still waiting, Your Majesty.<br> - Sorry, Your Majesty, to be<br> so persistent, but it is a...<br> - Money?<br> - Much more important.<br> - Oh, a woman.<br> Very well, come in.<br> Well, who is she?<br> - I'll come straight to the point,<br> - You usually do,<br> - [Woman] Is Her Majesty back?<br> - [Man] Yes,<br> Late, dear Countess, late.<br> Livenbaum, I'm in<br> no mood for you.<br> I had to go all the way<br> to town on the trolley.<br> - On the trolley, my dear, while you...<br> - Oh, your bursitis again.<br> - I do not have bursitis.<br> I have migraine,<br> - In the shoulder?<br> Another area wouldn't<br> surprise me as much.<br> Livenbaum, enough is...<br> - Is there someone in there with her?<br> - Paul.<br> Paul? You know he's been seen<br> publicly with that woman?<br> - Which woman?<br> - The impostor.<br> Prenez garde, Comtesse,<br> Perhaps the empress<br> will accept her?<br> - You mean he's going<br> to talk her into it?<br> - She's getting old.<br> - Never.<br> - And lonely.<br> - Never.<br> - And she...<br> - Never.<br> - [Empress] Livenbaum,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Do you know<br> what he wanted?<br> - I can imagine, Your Majesty.<br> - To see that woman.<br> How easily he swallows<br> the trick she performs.<br> And what do they prove? That she can<br> memorixe the teachings of Bounine.<br> What if there is a resemblance?<br> What if she does think<br> she is Anastasia?<br> Wanting a dream<br> does not make it true.<br> She's a fraud.<br> She must be.<br> - Well, isn't she?<br> - I... don't know, Your Majesty.<br> You all think<br> I'm stubborn, don't you?<br> I am. Very stubborn.<br> Perhaps too stubborn.<br> At what hotel is she staying?<br> "Believe me, I really tried.<br> My sincere regrets."<br> Sincere,<br> "Signed, Paul."<br> - Miserable handwriting.<br> - You think he really saw the empress?<br> What's the difference<br> whether he did and she refused,<br> or whether he didn't?<br> The answer's<br> the same for us: No.<br> [Phone Ringing]<br> Hello. Yes.<br> And who? Thank you.<br> Baroness von Livenbaum is<br> on her way up... with a lady.<br> - What lady?<br> - I think you'd better<br> go inside, both of you.<br> - Lady? Do you think it i...<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Petrovin, come.<br> Who is on the way up?<br> I think the empress.<br> She's coming here? Now?<br> I don't think I'll be able to face her.<br> - Don't be a fool.<br> - No, I'm not well enough.<br> Must it be now?<br> If I only could have some time?<br> - [Knocking]<br> - Get ready.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - Wait downstairs, Livenbaum.<br> I am deeply grateful,<br> Your Majesty.<br> I only hope that you will not allow<br> your opinion of me to interfere...<br> Bring her in.<br> Your Highness,<br> Her Majesty's waiting.<br> Courage.<br> Yes.<br> The resemblance is quite good enough<br> for a waxworks gallery.<br> - Don't you recognixe me?<br> - Should I?<br> Who are you?<br> Where were you born?<br> My birth certificate<br> says Tsarskoie Selo.<br> But I was really<br> born in Peterhof.<br> Daughter, no doubt,<br> to Tsar Nicholas II and Alexandra.<br> And granddaughter<br> to Maria Feodorovna...<br> dowager empress.<br> I have received too many appeals<br> from resurrected Romanovs.<br> The firing squads were such poor shots<br> it's amaxing the revolution succeeded.<br> Twice I started out<br> to find you, but...<br> There were so many days, weeks, even<br> months when I didn't know who I was.<br> And now you do?<br> I thought I did,<br> but if you don't know me...<br> Have I changed so much,<br> Your Majesty?<br> One does not change,<br> mademoiselle.<br> No, not if one is loved.<br> Perhaps if love<br> had not been cut off so abruptly...<br> I would not have changed so much.<br> You are making vulgar<br> and sentimental use...<br> of an episode which is for me<br> a great personal sorrow.<br> Forgive me.<br> I forgot for a moment...<br> that you would regard that tragedy<br> as more yours than mine.<br> I am trying to... You're making it<br> very difficult for me, Grandmama.<br> I did not give you permission<br> to call me that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> [Coughing]<br> You think a lonely old woman<br> should be eager to hear someone<br> call her "Grandmama"?<br> - My loneliness has been<br> as sharp as yours.<br> - We are most of us lonely.<br> And it is mostly<br> of our own making.<br> But no masquerade of any kind<br> can fill the emptiness.<br> You ask me for recognition,<br> You do it well,<br> Your eyes are moist, your voice<br> blurred with feeling,<br> I believe you are lonely<br> and you want love.<br> Who does not?<br> But the love you beg from me<br> belongs to one who is dead.<br> Are you so sure?<br> You have won the endorsement<br> of the sentimental, the greedy,<br> I am none of those,<br> So you shut me out before<br> you even open that door.<br> I was told you would<br> ask me difficult questions.<br> You are not even interested enough<br> to ask me one!<br> I am not interested in a demonstration<br> of the tricks taught you...<br> - by your business associates.<br> - I care nothing about their business!<br> - I care nothing about the money!<br> - Ah, but you know of the inheritance.<br> I know what they've told me.<br> I don't want money.<br> - Tell me to whom it should<br> be given and I'll give it.<br> - Easily said.<br> But you cannot give it away<br> until you have it.<br> And you cannot get it without<br> first obtaining my recognition.<br> It's useless to say that<br> that is not what I want.<br> You are so hard.<br> I remember hearing Father say<br> that in a fight you were harder<br> than anyone in the family.<br> I thought at the time that<br> that was a very strong word to use...<br> just because you and my mother<br> were quarreling over a necklace.<br> Some, some emeralds. Yes.<br> You wanted to keep them, though<br> they belonged to the imperial treasure.<br> Who told you that? Oh, there were<br> many who could have known.<br> You wore them with<br> your last court dress...<br> Green and gold velvet,<br> and a long train.<br> The photograph was<br> unflattering, but accurate.<br> My father took my mother's side<br> in the quarrel.<br> There they were, all of them<br> against you, but you were stubborn.<br> - You kept Figgy's emeralds.<br> - How did you learn to call<br> Catherine the Great "Figgy"?<br> We always called her that.<br> Sometimes we gave the nickname<br> to Maria because she had<br> such an eye for the men.<br> - And Olga used to say...<br> - Stop!<br> I forbid you<br> to bandy those names.<br> I can speak of them if I choose.<br> They are my sisters.<br> Impostor!<br> You call me that.<br> If you have any decency, end this<br> charade at once. I will pay you.<br> - I will give you more than<br> whatever Bounine promised you.<br> - Go away!<br> - I'm offering you money.<br> - Oh, please go.<br> So, you are giving up.<br> It wasn't enough to have<br> suffered the asylum...<br> Some people trying me,<br> using me, rejecting me.<br> And before that,<br> the cellar and the flight!<br> The rescue from the very edge<br> of the grave...<br> Years of lost memory in an asylum...<br> excellent material for melodrama.<br> Long empty days, in which<br> the consciousness of living<br> came only through pain.<br> Hardly melodrama.<br> And then slowly,<br> finally struggling up,,,<br> out of the water,<br> into the light...<br> into the air, thinking...<br> "Yes, perhaps yes, I may be...<br> "I must be... I am.<br> I am, and my grandmother<br> is still alive to tell me so."<br> My grandmother is alive to hold out<br> her hand full of money.<br> I'd rather you slapped me<br> across the face with that hand!<br> The tragic scene of despair.<br> Well done.<br> You are forgetting nothing,<br> are you?<br> I am sorry, mademoiselle...<br> that your failure to win me over<br> is such a cruel disappointment.<br> Good-bye.<br> - Oh, don't go,<br> - But you just told me to.<br> I promise I will not say anything<br> more to try and convince you.<br> - Then what do you want of me?<br> - A moment or two longer.<br> A moment more to be with you.<br> To pretend you do not think<br> what you do.<br> To close my eyes and pretend<br> it is years ago.<br> A terrace in the summer sun.<br> No, no, no. I promise, I promise<br> I will not say names or places.<br> The smell of the sea air.<br> The sound of a tennis ball.<br> The laughter from the courts<br> beyond the trees.<br> And your voice<br> calling me "Malenkaia".<br> And then the sudden lightning<br> in the summer sky.<br> - [Coughing]<br> - Are you ill?<br> I was, but I'm not now.<br> Have you seen a doctor?<br> A good one?<br> I'm well acquainted with doctors.<br> But it is kind of you to ask.<br> - I'd better go.<br> - I'm really not surprised<br> that you do not recognixe me.<br> - I have changed very much indeed.<br> - You asked for just one moment.<br> What is strange<br> is that you have changed so little.<br> It is as though the horror of all these<br> last years has only made you stronger.<br> I am not strong, mademoiselle.<br> Let me go.<br> You are too clever for me.<br> I am an old woman.<br> My strength is only outward now.<br> - At least we met again.<br> - And we will another time<br> when my mind is clearer.<br> - But now...<br> - No, we'd better not meet again.<br> You have softened towards me,<br> but later you'll regret it.<br> You'll say,<br> "It was all acting.<br> She was some cheap little actress<br> they hired for money, '"<br> And... in a way<br> they did hire me.<br> I was starving after I ran<br> from the last asylum.<br> I had nowhere to go.<br> Bounine found me<br> on the bank of the Seine.<br> Maybe there is more<br> good to him than we think,<br> Or maybe I should have run away from<br> him too, but I was so tired of running.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - [Coughing] Yes.<br> And if it is better<br> for you not to believe...<br> - You are ill.<br> - No.<br> I cough only because<br> I'm a little frightened.<br> It doesn't mean...<br> Say that again.<br> That I cough<br> when I'm frightened?<br> When you were a little girl<br> you coughed when you were frightened.<br> - Malenkaia... Malenkaia!<br> - [Weeping]<br> You have come from so far away,<br> and I've waited so long.<br> No, no, no.<br> Don't cry.<br> There's no need to be frightened.<br> No, don't speak.<br> You are safe, Anastasia.<br> You are with me. You're home!<br> The phantoms can go.<br> The closed rooms can be opened.<br> I have a footman...<br> Oh, he's a very old man...<br> And each night he goes<br> from one room to the other...<br> lighting the empty lamps...<br> until the great dark rooms<br> are a blaxe of light.<br> And perhaps that is true<br> of all of us.<br> We are lighting dead lamps<br> to illumine a past that is gone.<br> I thought you were gone, but<br> you have come back, Anastasia.<br> You have come back!<br> But, oh, please, if it should not<br> be you, don't ever tell me.<br> ?? [Gypsy]<br> Many beautiful shops<br> and restaurants... Yes.<br> Also we might make<br> a small trip to America.<br> After all, it's the only country left<br> with a proper respect for wealth.<br> - I hate trips.<br> - I would like to go to Uruguay.<br> - Yes, why?<br> - I like the name, "Uruguay".<br> - I hate it.<br> - And "Guatemala".<br> - They sound so far away.<br> - Yes, very.<br> - Why don't you charter a boat<br> and sail the high seas?<br> - I hate the sea.<br> My dear Maxine, you're here<br> to eat, drink, enjoy the show<br> and have a good time.<br> I hate Russian food.<br> I hate bad champagne.<br> I'm sick of the gypsies,<br> and I'm having a terrible time.<br> Then why don't you go home?<br> I hate my room even more.<br> ?

Wonderful!<br> Then we can have<br> the press conference at 7:30.<br> - In the grand ballroom of their hotel.<br> - Good.<br> - What about the marriage rumors?<br> - Yes.<br> Can we announce<br> her engagement to Paul?<br> You know, every time<br> Paul is mentioned, he gets peculiar.<br> - You don't think he's getting jealous?<br> - Yes.<br> I began to think<br> back in Copenhagen.<br> You're eating<br> like a pig again.<br> I'm nervous again.<br> - [Bounine] Where the devil<br> did that come from?<br> - The opera warehouse,<br> - I think it is very impressive.<br> - Stepan, get rid of those lights.<br> What time is it?<br> been waiting for her.<br> - Too late to do anything<br> about that throne.<br> - ?

Di...<br> - I told you 50 times.<br> I have not seen her,<br> nor him, nor the empress.<br> Perhaps if I write it very carefully,<br> in very big letters...<br> I'm sorry.

Proceed.<br> "At 10:15, the dowager empress<br> will make her appearance.<br> "At 10:20, the Russian national<br> anthem will be played,,,<br> - and Her Majesty will formally<br> present her granddaughter...

I do.<br> I was convalescing in the next ward<br> when they brought you in.<br> - It is possible.<br> - Possible, but you don't remember,<br> Well, when they discharged you,<br> a man was waiting for you<br> and took you home.<br> Me.<br> - General, I beg you, We cannot proc...<br> - Quiet.<br> - What is your name?<br> - Mikhail Vlados.<br> - Vlados.<br> - And yours is Anna Koreff!<br> - Koreff, is that true?<br> - Yes, I have used that name.<br> - Used it?<br> - Her Highness has used many names.<br> As you know, she has<br> been forced to hide.<br> Also she has suffered amnesia.<br> Please.<br> Mikhail Vlados...<br> Yes, we were in the same hospital<br> in Bucharest.<br> - They treated you for head wounds...<br> - They did.<br> Which you got in a train explosion<br> outside Bucharest.<br> - Is that true?<br> - Were you in a train wreck?<br> - Please, I would like to answer.<br> - All right.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, please!<br> Please!<br> Her Highness cannot hear your<br> questions, let alone answer them.<br> What is it you wish to know,<br> whether I was wounded...<br> - in a train explosion<br> on the way to Bucharest?<br> - [Reporters] Yes.<br> I remember being<br> in a train explosion.<br> Whether or not I was wounded,<br> I do not know.<br> - Well, where did you get the wounds?<br> - In Russia or in Bucharest?<br> - Is it not possible<br> to have been wounded twice?<br> - In a war maybe,<br> What else is a revolution?<br> I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,<br> the interview is over.<br> Make sure there are men<br> posted at every entrance...<br> to keep the reporters<br> from the guests.<br> - And check every invitation at the door.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I don't make things easier<br> for you, do I?<br> Was it a disaster?<br> No matter what the papers print,<br> before they can be on the street...<br> the guests will be here, and the empress<br> will have made the presentation.<br> - Oh, forgive me. May I?<br> - You may even give me one.<br> Thank you.<br> The stairs aren't<br> doing that dress any good.<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> - It will in an hour.<br> I haven't seen you<br> in a long time.<br> And you missed me terribly.<br> I missed you, yes.<br> Whose orders kept you from<br> seeing me, the empress's or Paul's?<br> Apparently, it has<br> never occurred to you...<br> that I can function<br> without orders from anyone.<br> Then you didn't want<br> to see me. Why?<br> I thought it better not to.<br> The marriage rumors are true.<br> You yourself told me that<br> Paul and I were engaged years ago.<br> - Aren't you taking your royal<br> duties a bit too seriously?<br> - Independently, you mean.<br> - The puppet has pulled<br> the strings herself.<br> - This is childish.<br> You've always had an obsession<br> that people want you to do<br> only what they tell you.<br> No, not people. You.<br> - Nonsense.<br> - Is it?<br> You pushed me at Paul.<br> And now you're against him. Why?<br> - Are you afraid that<br> he's going to be in control?<br> - Over what?<br> - Over me. Over the money.<br> - I don't give a hang about the money.<br> Then what is bothering you,<br> that I might be Anna Koreff?<br> I don't care what your name is.<br> I care what you are.<br> What bothers me<br> is the way you've changed.<br> - I'm the one who has changed.<br> - Yes!<br> When we began you wanted<br> to find out who you were.<br> You said that was<br> all you wanted.<br> - Yes, I s...<br> - But is it? No!<br> Now you must be the Grand Duchess<br> Anastasia Nicolaevna.<br> Now you must be placed upon a throne<br> before a morgue of royal corpses.<br> - Must you always hate?<br> Must you always ridicule?<br> - Ridicule who?<br> Your loyal loving subjects?<br> Those embalmed skeletons?<br> They don't care about you!<br> They don't care who is Anastasia,<br> so long as they get money<br> and a better position...<br> in a world that is dead<br> and buried, and should be!<br> You didn't say that a month ago.<br> Then you wanted it,<br> and you wanted it for me!<br> - Well, now I like it.<br> - Go on, like it.<br> Be a grand duchess!<br> And make it really royal.<br> Marry a man who wouldn't come<br> within ten feet of the altar...<br> if you were not an heiress.<br> Oh, the truth is insulting.<br> You told me once that I was<br> selfish and ambitious.<br> And I admitted<br> that you were right.<br> And I admitted<br> that you were right.<br> Why don't you now have the courage<br> to admit that I'm right?<br> Why don't you now have the courage<br> to admit that I'm right?<br> ? [Orchestra]<br> - Remember?<br> - What?<br> - The music. This waltx.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - No, you don't really.<br> - Sorry. Should I?<br> No, it was a long time ago.<br> My first waltx.<br> My first ball.<br> - My first...<br> - What?<br> Partner.<br> I thought it was you.<br> It must have been somebody else.<br> - It might have been me.<br> - It really doesn't matter.<br> It might not even<br> have been at the ball.<br> - Frankly, I don't understand you.<br> - Why?<br> - Because I didn't deny what Vlados said?<br> - Yes.<br> How do you know<br> that I'm not Anna Koreff?<br> - Be serious.<br> - I am.<br> You're deliberately behaving<br> very strangely tonight.<br> How do you know<br> how Anna Koreff behaves?<br> I know how you behave.<br> And all I care about is you.<br> - Do you mean that?<br> - Of course.<br> Then let's announce<br> our engagement tonight.<br> I want to very much.<br> Prince Paul von Haraldeberg<br> to Miss Anna Koreff.<br> - Will you announce that?<br> - Certainly not.<br> - Oh.<br> - Because it's not true.<br> No? Suppose I have no title,<br> no inheritance, nothing.<br> I can't suppose that when I know<br> perfectly well who you are.<br> Still, what if I can't get the money?<br> Or if I make no claim to it?<br> You can and you will. Why be poor<br> when you can so easily be very rich?<br> The poor have only one advantage.<br> They know when they are loved<br> for themselves.<br> Sorry, but I refuse to take<br> that remark seriously.<br> - The empress is ready.<br> She's upstairs in the green room.<br> - Good.<br> - It's almost time.<br> - All right.<br> - Oh, Piotr Ivanovich.<br> Should I not be back in time...<br> - Why not?<br> Just go ahead without me.<br> Sergei Pavlovich,<br> isn't this all superb?<br> - I have never seen you look so well.<br> - In this? Oh.<br> They don't know how<br> to make baggage nowadays.<br> Imagine trying to fit this<br> into a modern suitcase.<br> [Chuckling] Oh, the times<br> aren't suited for elegance.<br> But you have<br> brought it back ce soir,<br> - What's the matter? You look upset.<br> - No, just tired.<br> Would you ask Her Majesty if she would<br> receive me for just a moment?<br> You know I will.<br> General, General!<br> - You may go in.<br> - It's very kind of you.<br> - Just in case,<br> she's heard about the reporters.<br> - Thank you.<br> Vassili, Her Majesty<br> is expecting the general.<br> I was going to send<br> for you, Bounine.<br> My granddaughter tells me<br> to expect some unpleasantness<br> in the newspapers.<br> - I'm afraid so, Your Majesty.<br> - Thank you.<br> The man was probably<br> a hired troublemaker.<br> - Her Highness says that actually...<br> - I'm aware what she says.<br> Unfortunately, she is not aware...<br> that truth serves only a world<br> that lives by it.<br> I have prepared a statement<br> for the press...<br> that I want you to give to them<br> before you leave tonight.<br> I am leaving now,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Oh, and why?<br> I feel that my work is finished,<br> satisfactorily, I trust.<br> And since this is your evening<br> I felt it my duty...<br> And since this is your evening<br> I felt it my duty...<br> No, that isn't quite true. I simply<br> wanted to say good-bye to you.<br> Extraordinary.<br> You want to leave<br> before the spectacle.<br> I should have thought no one would<br> watch it with more triumph than you.<br> If the evening belongs to anyone,<br> General, it is to you.<br> - We are all grateful.<br> - Thank you, but I want<br> no further part in it.<br> Come. After all, you performed<br> an enormous task.<br> You've restored my granddaughter<br> to her rightful position.<br> And, unless I have been misinformed...<br> you even effected her reunion<br> with her childhood sweetheart.<br> Yes, to a degree, I suppose I did.<br> But you are not particularly pleased<br> with it, are you? You are not pleased.<br> - Why not?<br> - But I am not in a position...<br> Oh, come. After all,<br> it is extremely unlike you...<br> to speak of position, Bounine.<br> When I am with Your Majesty,<br> I'm deeply aware of it.<br> Thank you.<br> Then I request you answer.<br> If it is what the grand duchess<br> really desires...<br> why then, I must be pleased.<br> But for myself, no,<br> I am not pleased.<br> [Chuckling] We should not only<br> have given you that title...<br> we should have made you<br> an ambassador.<br> How deviously you have arrived<br> at what you wanted to say.<br> And even now,<br> you don't say it.<br> You have not given me even<br> a piece of string to hang you with.<br> Sergei Pavlovich,<br> what do you wish to ask?<br> Why do you try to ask me?<br> Why have you not asked her?<br> Often what is difficult<br> for others is simple for me.<br> But what has always been<br> the simplest for others,<br> is impossible for me.<br> I made the attempt, Your Majesty,<br> but it became translated into anger.<br> You're less of a knave<br> than I thought...<br> - but very much more of a fool.<br> - [Knocking]<br> Yes?<br> Excuse me, Your Majesty.<br> It's time.<br> So soon.<br> Bounine, I want you<br> to wait for me here.<br> This time it is a command.<br> Will you?<br> Yes, Your Majesty. I will.<br> Your Majesty, I cannot wait for you<br> to look down into the ballroom.<br> You'll weep absolute tears.<br> Everyone's there.<br> And the gowns. And the uniforms.<br> It's incredible, like it used to be.<br> Yes, I can smell the mothballs.<br> Your Imperial Majesty,<br> I beg you... Excuse me.<br> If Your Majesty will permit me<br> to explain the ceremony, and...<br> - Livenbaum.<br> - We discussed the ceremony this morning.<br> - Yes, but, uh...<br> - The "but" we'll discuss later.<br> Yes, Baroness.<br> How lovely you are.<br> - Are you having a good time?<br> - Yes, Grandmama.<br> - Where is Paul?<br> - He's dancing with<br> the Princess of Falkenburg.<br> - He dances very well.<br> - Yes, very well.<br> - And he's very handsome.<br> - Yes, he's handsome.<br> - Your Majesty, a thousand apologies...<br> - Your Majesty, it is time.<br> If they have waited ten years,<br> they should not mind<br> waiting ten minutes more.<br> Livenbaum, I want to speak<br> to my granddaughter alone.<br> Out, gentlemen! Out.<br> Where is Bounine?<br> It is just like him to disappear<br> when he is really needed.<br> All right, ladies. Count.<br> Livenbaum,<br> That gentleman you are so fond of,<br> see that he does not leave<br> the green room.<br> Yes, Your Majesty.<br> - They're whirling in delight down there.<br> - Yes.<br> Come here.<br> Let me put it on for you.<br> Are you that tired of it already?<br> - It's just that I'm not used to one.<br> - It takes time.<br> Are you sure about Paul?<br> I, I like him very much.<br> - Why do you stammer?<br> - I was surprised by<br> the suddenness of the question.<br> If you love, the answer<br> is always ready.<br> I've been asked to announce<br> your engagement tonight.<br> - Are you sure you want me to?<br> - I want to marry.<br> Why?<br> I suppose I want<br> the belonging, the closeness.<br> - Am I selfish?<br> - No, but do you want all this with Paul?<br> I think it will<br> please you, Grandmama.<br> And anything that will please you<br> would please me.<br> Do you know you are talking<br> exactly like Bounine?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Anastasia Nicolaevna, you don't<br> really want to marry Paul.<br> - I don't know.<br> - You do know.<br> Because you really<br> want someone else.<br> Do I? Maybe.<br> Except that all this time...<br> the only thing I thought<br> I really wanted was you.<br> That you already have.<br> And it's not enough,<br> nor should it be.<br> No one can blame me for living with<br> my dear phantoms. But you...<br> You must find the things from which<br> other women make their happiness.<br> Sit here for just<br> one moment longer.<br> Livenbaum says things are just as<br> they used to be down in the ballroom.<br> She is foolish.<br> The world moves on, Malenkaia...<br> and we must move on with it,<br> or be left to molder with the past.<br> I am the past. I like it.<br> It's sweet and familiar.<br> The present is cold and foreign.<br> And the future...<br> [Chuckles]<br> Fortunately, I don't need to concern<br> myself with that. But you do.<br> It's yours.<br> Unfasten this for me,<br> will you please?<br> - Figgy's emeralds?<br> - Yes, I want to give them to you.<br> Grandmama, you have given me<br> what no one else in the world could...<br> Myself. Thank you.<br> Here, here.<br> You'd better fix it yourself.<br> Go into the green room.<br> - Livenbaum will help you.<br> - Yes, Grandmama.<br> Hurry.<br> There's not much time.<br> [Door Closes]<br> Forgive me, Your Majesty.<br> Yes, what is it?<br> I thought you'd like to know that<br> the gentleman no longer waits alone.<br> Good. I suppose we shall<br> have to go on with the performance.<br> - Bring in the jesters.<br> - Yes, Your Majesty.<br> - Ladies and gentlemen...<br> - Baroness.<br> Oh, Your Majesty, I beg you.<br> We cannot keep them waiting any longer.<br> - May we proceed now?<br> - Yes, yes. Proceed.<br> Majesty. Oh, uh...<br> - The musicians?<br> - All arranged.<br> - Good. Take your position<br> by the curtains.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Eh! Straighten your tie.<br> And you, Excellency, please<br> don't forget, all the names...<br> loud, strong, clear.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - Oh, thank you, Excellency.<br> Uh, ladies, get ready.<br> Where is, uh...<br> - Where is Prince Paul?<br> - I told you twice, he's coming.<br> Twice, and three times you've told me<br> you cannot find Bounine.<br> - I also told you that he said...<br> - Yes, yes, to go ahead without him.<br> Well, I say there is something<br> unbalanced with him tonight.<br> And the sooner we fin...<br> Oh, Your Highness.<br> Your Majesty.<br> I've never seen you<br> look like this before.<br> I have never felt<br> like this before.<br> It is time.<br> Would you be so kind<br> as to inform Her Imperial Highness,<br> the Grand Duchess, we are ready.<br> - Right away.<br> - Hurry.<br> Baroness, uh, the procedure.<br> Just to refresh your memory as<br> to what we discussed this morning.<br> - You think my mind is failing?<br> - [Laughing] Baron...<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> there will be a, "a drumroll."<br> After that, Her Imperial Majesty,<br> the Dowager Empress, will come forward.<br> And when she passes<br> through the curtains...<br> the orchestra will strike up<br> our national anthem.<br> - After that, the grand duchess,<br> escorted by His Highness...<br> - She has gone! She has gone!<br> - After that, the grand duchess,<br> escorted by His Highness...<br> - She has gone! She has gone!<br> Gone? Gone where?<br> What is he talking about?<br> She's not there!<br> I looked all over. She has gone!<br> - But this is impossible.<br> I mean, she must be...<br> - Silence!<br> - You have looked in the green room?<br> - Yes, Your Majesty,<br> - There is no one there.<br> - No one.<br> Perhaps she went to her room.<br> Quick, send somebody...<br> You won't find her.<br> It's a waste of time.<br> They have both gone.<br> - Both?<br> - She and your friend Bounine.<br> - Bounine?<br> - But why? I don't understand.<br> - You never did.<br> - You mean the others were right?<br> - She was not Anastasia, after all.<br> - Wasn't she?<br> Your Majesty, I beg you.<br> They're all waiting down there.<br> - What shall we say to them?<br> What can we say to them?<br> - Nothing.<br> Paul, your arm.<br> I will speak to them.<br> Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.<br> Everybody, please.<br> Forgive me, Aunt Marie,<br> but what will you say?<br> Say? Oh, I will say...<br> "The play is over. Go home."<br>
