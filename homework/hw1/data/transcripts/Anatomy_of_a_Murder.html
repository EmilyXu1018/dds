You just leave a message.<br> Tell her to call this number.<br> - What do you say there, Counsellor?<br> - Save your money.<br> - What's in the brown paper bag?<br> - It might be a cabbage head.<br> But it wouldn't be.<br> You're a very suspicious man.<br> True.<br> I'm everlastingly suspicious of...<br> ...andlor fascinated by...<br> ...the contents of brown paper bags.<br> - Can I sneak a peek?<br> - You do that, Counsellor.<br> You do that.<br> After you sneak a peek,<br> why, you uncork whatever you find.<br> Shall I pour?<br> - Your privilege.<br> - My pleasure, sir.<br> You fought this soldier by yourself.<br> You've been drinking alone, Pauly.<br> I don't like that.<br> Drop the stone, Counsellor.<br> You live in a glass house.<br> My windows were busted a long time ago,<br> so I can say as I please.<br> - Have an Italian cigar?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Those stinkweeds<br> are another sign of your decadence.<br> Pauly, it's a fact.<br> Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out<br> of the office of public prosecutor...<br> ...you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.<br> Not that I don't understand how you feel.<br> A man who gets beat out of an office<br> he's held for a long time...<br> ...feels his community has deserted him.<br> The finger of scorn is pointed at him.<br> None but the lonely hearts<br> shall know my anguish.<br> Pauly, you are a good lawyer.<br> You ought to make like one.<br> Be here ready for clients, not fishing...<br> ...and playing that rooty-tooty jazz.<br> I'm making a living.<br> I run a few abstracts and divorce Jane Doe<br> from John Doe every once in a while.<br> Threaten a few deadbeats.<br> And in the evening I sit around...<br> ...and drink bourbon whiskey and read law<br> with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy.<br> One of the world's great men.<br> That was a kind word, Pauly.<br> You know, I might have been.<br> That's one of the reasons I hate to see<br> your talent pushed aside by lesser men.<br> I look at you and see myself years ago,<br> with the same love for the smell...<br> ...of the old brown books in a dusty office.<br> Here's a rose, a lily...<br> ...a sweet lupine.<br> The United States Supreme Court Reports.<br> What shall we read this evening,<br> Counsellor?<br> How about a little Chief Justice Holmes?<br> Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.<br> I might have a client. Waiting for a call.<br> - Hello?<br> - Mr. Biegler?<br> This is Paul Biegler speaking.<br> Hello, Mrs. Manion?<br> - What?<br> - Mr. Biegler?<br> I'm sorry I missed you.<br> Did you get my message?<br> Who? What is that name?<br> Just a minute, please.<br> We seem to have a bad connection.<br> It's a woman named Manion.<br> Maida took a message from her.<br> In Thunder Bay? If she wants you<br> to represent her husband, say yes.<br> - I don't know what it's all about.<br> - Pretend you do and say yes.<br> - Hello?<br> - Mr. Biegler?<br> This is much better now.<br> Yes, I can hear you fine.<br> I waited for your call all afternoon.<br> Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago.<br> You've read about my husband?<br> Muffy, please.<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Biegler,<br> have you read about my husband?<br> Yes, I have. A little.<br> Will you defend him?<br> I don't know.<br> I'd have to know more about it.<br> Will you talk to him?<br> He's in the county jail.<br> Will you see him in the morning?<br> He's very anxious to see you.<br> You've been so highly recommended.<br> I have?<br> Yes, someone told him about you.<br> Will you see him?<br> I suppose I could.<br> I'll see him tomorrow morning.<br> - Would you want me there, too?<br> - I think that would be fine.<br> Let's make it about 10:00.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> - You're quite welcome.<br> What's this all about?<br> A man named Barney Quill<br> raped Mrs. Manion.<br> Her husband is a lieutenant in the Army.<br> There's a base in Thunder Bay,<br> gunnery or something.<br> The lieutenant goes to Quill's place<br> and plugs Quill about five times...<br> ...which causes Quill<br> to die of lead poisoning.<br> - When?<br> - A couple of nights ago.<br> If you hadn't been out fishing in some<br> godforsaken place, you'd have known.<br> Good morning, Maida.<br> - There it is.<br> - What?<br> The newspaper.<br> I thought maybe they didn't bring it.<br> We haven't paid the bill.<br> Did you get my note?<br> We may be in the case.<br> I'm reading up on it now...<br> ...before talking to Lt. Manion.<br> Doesn't he ever go home?<br> You mean Parnell?<br> We were up late last night.<br> Is that a fact?<br> I think maybe you'd better cancel<br> all my appointments for today.<br> What appointments?<br> People think you've migrated to the woods.<br> If this refrigerator gets more fish in it...<br> ...it'll swim upstream<br> and spawn all by itself.<br> May I have your attention<br> for a moment, please?<br> Yeah.<br> I went over your cheque-book yesterday.<br> I can't pay me my salary.<br> What happened to the fee<br> for the Walkers' divorce?<br> Help salt a uranium mine or something?<br> I bought a few bare necessities.<br> Like a new outboard motor.<br> I wish I could be classed as a necessity.<br> - Aren't you going to have any toast?<br> - No.<br> I'll call you.<br> Let you know how things are going.<br> Now, don't let him pay you off<br> in Purple Hearts.<br> Those professional soldiers<br> never have a dime.<br> I ought to know, I was married to one.<br> Pardon me. Are you Mrs. Manion?<br> - Hi.<br> - I'm Paul Biegler.<br> - I'm Laura.<br> - How do you do?<br> - This is Muff.<br> - Hello, Muff.<br> The jail's right here.<br> You're tall!<br> - Hello, Pauly.<br> - Hi, Sulo.<br> You wait here, Muffy.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - How're you feeling?<br> Fine. I guess you've come<br> for the soldier boy?<br> Yes. Do you think we could talk<br> in the sheriff's office?<br> Sure, I'll bring him down.<br> Would you mind taking your glasses off,<br> Mrs. Manion?<br> Gee-whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?<br> More than that. You should see. All over.<br> You can put them back on,<br> if it's more comfortable for you.<br> This is Pauly Biegler.<br> This is the bucko, Pauly.<br> - Lt. Manion?<br> - Hello, there.<br> - Hi, Manny.<br> - Hello, Laura.<br> I wonder if you could meet me<br> down at my office about 2:00 p.m.<br> It's 305 West Barnham.<br> - Of course.<br> - Fine.<br> - Is there anything I can get you, hon?<br> - I'm all right, hon.<br> Right in here.<br> Wanted: The Big 10.<br> They got the 10 best-dressed dames,<br> the 10 top teams, the 10 top tunes...<br> ...and now the 10 most-wanted.<br> Don't knock it. That's the American dream.<br> Those boys made the grade.<br> You were the district attorney around here,<br> weren't you?<br> Yes. Ten years.<br> What's your experience<br> as a defence lawyer?<br> Not very much.<br> How do I know you can handle my case?<br> I guess you don't know.<br> Shall we talk about it?<br> I suppose so.<br> Come on. Don't be so bored.<br> You know, it might very well be<br> that no lawyer can "handle" your case...<br> ...if you mean getting off scot-free.<br> You seem to be forgetting:<br> Barney Quill raped my wife.<br> I have the unwritten law on my side.<br> The unwritten law is a myth.<br> There is no such thing<br> as the unwritten law.<br> Anyone who commits murder<br> on the theory it does exist...<br> ...has bought himself room and board<br> in the state penitentiary.<br> Maybe for life.<br> With that in mind, perhaps we can proceed<br> with a few questions and answers that...<br> Can I borrow your lighter?<br> We can proceed with a few questions...<br> ...that might be of some help<br> in your defence.<br> But probably won't be.<br> That's a nice lighter.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Twenty-eight.<br> - How long have you been in the service?<br> - Since '50.<br> - Have you seen any action?<br> - Korea.<br> - Do you have any decorations?<br> - Plenty.<br> - Is this your first marriage?<br> - No.<br> You're not on the witness stand.<br> You don't have to answer yes or no.<br> Just give me the matrimonial rundown.<br> Is this necessary?<br> I'll be the judge of that.<br> My first wife divorced me.<br> Charged cruelty.<br> Eating crackers in bed,<br> you know, the usual stuff.<br> The truth was, she found another guy<br> when I was in Korea.<br> I met Laura four years ago, in Georgia.<br> We were married right after her divorce.<br> Did you know the husband?<br> He was in my outfit down there.<br> You mean you were buddies?<br> I'll withdraw the question.<br> That's a little old-fashioned.<br> Have there been any children<br> by or from any of these marriages?<br> - No.<br> - Any present prospects?<br> Not unless Barney Quill started something.<br> What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?<br> War souvenir. Luger.<br> The police have it now.<br> I suppose you've read<br> the newspaper stories about your case?<br> Some of them.<br> - Are they substantially correct?<br> - Yes.<br> And you didn't see Quill<br> rape and beat your wife?<br> No. When she got back to the trailer,<br> she told me what had happened.<br> How long was it<br> before you went to Quill's and killed him?<br> I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.<br> That long?<br> The newspapers say your wife volunteered<br> to take a lie-detector test.<br> Know anything about this?<br> Only what I read and what she told me.<br> Do you know<br> how the lie-detector test turned out?<br> - They didn't tell her.<br> - Yes, Sulo?<br> Pauly, we got lunch served for the jail.<br> Do you want to eat with us?<br> - Does your sister still cook for the jail?<br> - Sure, she cooks.<br> You give her my compliments, Sulo.<br> I've got a luncheon date downtown.<br> - Nice going...<br> - I'll be back after lunch.<br> I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.<br> No, you're not.<br> Come on, bucko.<br> Pass the salt, Pauly.<br> Thank you.<br> Did you give the lieutenant<br> the well-known lecture?<br> If you mean,<br> "Did I coach him into a phoney story?" No.<br> Maybe you're too pure, Paul. Too pure<br> for the natural impurities of the law.<br> Could be that you owe the lieutenant<br> a chance to find a defence.<br> You might guide him, show him the way<br> and let him decide if he wants to take it.<br> - Want some salt?<br> - No, I'm not ready.<br> I'm not the right lawyer for this fellow.<br> He's insolent, hostile.<br> You don't have to love him,<br> just defend him.<br> What's the matter, don't you need a fee?<br> You know something?<br> I think you might be a little bit afraid.<br> - Afraid of what?<br> - That you might get licked.<br> You know, there's only one thing<br> more devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...<br> ...and that's an Irish lawyer. Pass the salt.<br> Put it down!<br> - Hello, there.<br> - I usually answer to the name Paul.<br> Are we gonna have some more jokes?<br> Not unless you want to be the comic.<br> - I brought you some cigarettes.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Peace?<br> - Sure.<br> Fine. Now, Lieutenant...<br> ...there are four ways I can defend murder.<br> Number 1: It wasn't murder.<br> It was suicide or accidental.<br> Number 2: You didn't do it.<br> Number 3: You were legally justified.<br> Like protecting your home or self-defence.<br> Number 4: The killing was excusable.<br> Where do I fit into this rosy picture?<br> I'll tell you where you don't fit.<br> You don't fit in any of the first three.<br> Why wouldn't I be legally justified<br> in killing the man who raped my wife?<br> The time element.<br> If you'd caught him in the act, the shooting<br> might be justified. But you didn't.<br> You had time to get the police.<br> You didn't do that, either.<br> You're guilty of murder,<br> premeditated and with vengeance.<br> That's first-degree murder<br> in any court of law.<br> - So I should plead guilty?<br> - When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.<br> - Cop out?<br> - That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.<br> If you're not telling me to cop out,<br> what are you telling me?<br> I'm not telling you to do anything.<br> I just want you to understand<br> the letter of the law.<br> - Go on.<br> - Go on with what?<br> Whatever it is you're getting at.<br> You're very bright.<br> Let's see how really bright you can be.<br> Well, I'm working at it.<br> Because your wife was raped, you'll have<br> a favourable atmosphere in the courtroom.<br> The sympathy will be with you<br> if all the facts are true.<br> What you need is a legal peg...<br> ...so the jury can hang up<br> their sympathy in your behalf.<br> - You follow me?<br> - Yes.<br> What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?<br> What's your legal excuse<br> for killing Barney Quill?<br> Not justification, huh?<br> Not justification.<br> Excuse.<br> Just excuse, huh?<br> What excuses are there?<br> How should I know?<br> You're the one that plugged Quill.<br> I must've been mad.<br> - How's that?<br> - I said I must've been mad.<br> A bad temper's no excuse.<br> I mean, I must've been crazy.<br> Am I getting warmer?<br> Okay, Sulo. I'm going...<br> Am I getting warmer?<br> I'll tell you that<br> after I've talked to your wife.<br> In the meantime, see if you can remember<br> just how crazy you were.<br> Is Mrs. Manion here yet?<br> She's been waiting quite a while.<br> She's been through all your albums<br> from Dixieland to Brubeck.<br> What do you think of her?<br> Soft, easy. The kind men<br> like to take advantage of, and do.<br> Did you get any money?<br> - Huh?<br> - Money.<br> I haven't decided to take the case yet.<br> You surprise me, sometimes.<br> Why? I've been around.<br> Yeah, well...<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> I think we'd better talk.<br> You're a funny kind of a lawyer.<br> The music, I mean.<br> Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?<br> Not that kind of music.<br> I guess that settles it.<br> I'm a funny kind of a lawyer.<br> Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?<br> Where'd you go to school?<br> Where did you grow up?<br> No place in particular. We moved around.<br> My father was a boomer.<br> Construction boomer.<br> Building dams mostly. Call me Laura.<br> - Is your family still alive, Laura?<br> - No.<br> I have some cigarettes<br> around here someplace.<br> - Want a cigarette?<br> - No, I wanted to offer you one.<br> - You could light it for me.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Here.<br> That's just like your husband's, isn't it?<br> He gave me this because I liked the one<br> he had. He's like that.<br> He gives me presents all the time.<br> You have a happy marriage?<br> Yes.<br> What went wrong with the first marriage?<br> What went wrong<br> is when I went for Manny.<br> - That's honest enough.<br> - It was more than just that.<br> Like I told you, I grew up on the move,<br> and Jack, my first husband...<br> ...didn't like to move.<br> He wouldn't even take a transfer.<br> I was really bored. Manny likes to go.<br> We're always going.<br> Whenever we get the chance.<br> We've been all over.<br> I'm thirsty.<br> Water? Or would a beer do?<br> I think a beer would do fine.<br> Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?<br> - Are you married?<br> - No.<br> That's nice.<br> What do you do alone in this house<br> if you aren't married?<br> It's a family home.<br> I'm the last of the family...<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Aren't you having one?<br> - No, not right now.<br> There you are.<br> Could Muff have a little?<br> In that ashtray, maybe? He loves beer.<br> You want a beer for the dog?<br> Well, here we are.<br> He'll go to sleep now.<br> - Isn't he cute?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, how about it? Are you ready?<br> I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?<br> I know what you mean.<br> Suppose you tell me<br> everything you told the state police...<br> ...plus, everything you didn't tell<br> the state police.<br> Where shall I begin?<br> What time did you leave for Quill's bar?<br> Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.<br> Manny was late getting home<br> from the firing range. So, we had dinner.<br> He laid down and went to sleep.<br> I hadn't been out of the trailer all day,<br> so I took Muff and a flashlight...<br> ...and walked over to the bar.<br> I bought a drink<br> and played the pinball machine.<br> Many people in the bar?<br> Not many. Barney came over<br> and challenged me to a game. For drinks.<br> How well did you know Barney?<br> He owned this bar where Manny and I went<br> sometimes, that's all.<br> - Had he ever made a pass at you?<br> - No, nothing like that at all.<br> Was he drinking heavily that night?<br> He didn't seem to be.<br> At least, not when we were playing pinball.<br> Were you with him<br> the whole time you were there?<br> No, there were other people playing.<br> What time did you leave the bar?<br> About 11:00, I guess.<br> I left by the side door.<br> Muff was carrying the flashlight.<br> He carries it in his mouth.<br> He's so cute,<br> running along with the light shining.<br> Was he sober?<br> Muff? Of course he was sober.<br> You're joking now, aren't you?<br> Yes, I'm joking. Go on.<br> Well, Barney came from somewhere,<br> not the door I left by.<br> He said he was going my way<br> and he could drive me home.<br> He said the bears were prowling around<br> and I oughtn't to walk home.<br> The bears come out at night to scavenge.<br> They're harmless enough, aren't they?<br> I suppose I wouldn't have been afraid<br> in the daylight, but...<br> ...the dark isn't the same.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Now, you got into Barney's car...<br> I got in and he drove to the trailer park.<br> He made overtures?<br> No, nothing.<br> When we got to the trailer park,<br> the auto-gate was closed.<br> Mr. Lemon closes it about 11:00,<br> or a little after.<br> I thanked Barney<br> and started to get out of the car...<br> ...but he said<br> there wasn't any need for me to walk.<br> That he could drive me into the park<br> on another road.<br> I didn't know there was another road,<br> but he drove on...<br> ...before I could say yes or no.<br> - Were you alarmed?<br> - No, I'm not usually afraid of men.<br> And anyway, he hadn't touched me<br> or even said anything out of the way.<br> Doesn't a woman sort of instinctively know<br> when a fellow's on the make?<br> Sure, but that's only usual with me,<br> with almost all men.<br> Ever since I was a kid.<br> You, for instance. You're interested.<br> But there isn't any reason to be afraid<br> of you. It was like that with Barney.<br> Mrs. Manion, believe me,<br> I'm not in the least...<br> Call me Laura.<br> Laura, I'm only interested in helping<br> your husband. Nothing more.<br> I don't mean you'd try anything.<br> I just mean, it's the way you look at me.<br> It would be very difficult<br> not to look at you.<br> The way I dress, you mean?<br> You don't like it?<br> I love it. I just love it.<br> We'd better keep moving along<br> with this thing.<br> How were you dressed that night?<br> In a sweater, like this, and a skirt.<br> And the rest? What about that?<br> Underneath? I had on a slip<br> and panties and a bra.<br> No girdle?<br> I don't need a girdle.<br> Do you think I need a girdle?<br> I don't know. How should...<br> I'm only concerned with the few facts<br> that might be of help to me...<br> ...to defend your husband. That's all.<br> - Well, I don't wear one.<br> - Okay, no girdle.<br> All right. Now, go on.<br> He turned off the highway into a lane<br> in the woods, and he stopped the car...<br> ...and turned off the lights.<br> And then he grabbed me and he said,<br> "I'm gonna rape you." Just like that.<br> He used those words?<br> Exactly those words. Muff began to bark,<br> so he threw him out the window.<br> I could hear little Muffy whining<br> outside the car, all through it.<br> Barney began to try to get at me<br> and I fought him off as best I could.<br> But he was terribly strong.<br> Did you cry out? Did you scream?<br> Didn't seem to be much use,<br> out there in the woods.<br> He began to shout names at me<br> like "army slut" and some other names.<br> Then, he drew back<br> and hit me with his fist.<br> He hit me again and I didn't fight anymore.<br> I must've been only half-conscious...<br> ...but I know that he tore my panties off<br> and did what he wanted.<br> The newspapers said<br> a doctor examined you...<br> ...and he didn't think you'd been raped.<br> I don't care what the doctor thought,<br> a woman doesn't mistake these things.<br> All right. Go ahead.<br> I don't know exactly what happened then,<br> I must've fainted.<br> The next thing I remember,<br> the car was moving.<br> Barney was driving very fast<br> and he was breathing hard.<br> An ugly, gasping sound.<br> We were on the main road<br> to the trailer park...<br> ...and he swung in by the gate<br> and stopped.<br> I opened the door to get out.<br> Muffy jumped out<br> with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You said he'd thrown Muff out of the car,<br> back in the woods.<br> He did, but he must've let him back in.<br> I don't remember.<br> All right. You opened the door<br> and Muff got out first.<br> Before I could get out, Barney grabbed me<br> and said he was gonna...<br> ...tear all my clothes off<br> and attack me again.<br> I got away and ran.<br> I could see Muff at an opening in the fence.<br> He was scooting back and forth<br> with the flashlight.<br> Barney caught me from behind<br> and I fell to the ground.<br> He fell on top of me<br> and began to beat me with his fists.<br> I thought he was gonna kill me.<br> I screamed and somehow<br> I got to my feet again and ran.<br> I went through the opening in the fence,<br> followed Muffy...<br> ...who was running ahead<br> with the flashlight.<br> I kept following the light<br> until he led me to our trailer.<br> And you didn't see Barney again?<br> I never laid eyes on him again,<br> dead or alive.<br> I think that's enough for now.<br> I've got lots of time. All you want.<br> Where can I reach you?<br> I'm still in Thunder Bay,<br> but I can drive down again in the morning.<br> - Was there something else?<br> - No.<br> - Thanks for letting me play the records.<br> - You're very welcome.<br> - Who was that?<br> - The lady in the case.<br> You're not gonna take the case?<br> I don't know. That depends on<br> what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.<br> He's thinking things out.<br> That's more like it.<br> If I take the case, I'll want you in it.<br> Me? In a big murder case?<br> The sight of this whiskey-drinking old man<br> at the counsel table would ruin you.<br> I need you.<br> You mean that?<br> Why else would he say it?<br> I'll be glad to work with you outside<br> the courtroom, but not in the courtroom.<br> You suit yourself about that.<br> Either way, I'm gonna have to be able<br> to depend on you.<br> Will you lay off the booze?<br> I don't know about that.<br> Why don't you know?<br> Do you think I could lay off the booze?<br> Have you ever tried it?<br> Try it.<br> I've never been in a big murder case.<br> Not once in all my life.<br> Well, it's up to you, Parn.<br> Will you be around tonight?<br> Yeah, I'll be around.<br> Maida, darling, I might manage it.<br> I might manage to be a real lawyer again...<br> ...for a little while, anyway.<br> I tried remembering.<br> There were still some pieces missing.<br> I remember...<br> ...going to Quill's bar with a gun.<br> And I remember Quill's face<br> behind the bar...<br> ...but I don't remember anything else.<br> Not even going home.<br> Don't you remember firing the gun?<br> Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.<br> I remember hearing shots,<br> but they don't seem connected with me.<br> They seemed far away, like somebody else<br> was doing the shooting.<br> Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.<br> Thanks, Mr. Biegler.<br> There's the little matter of the fee.<br> $3,000. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?<br> More than reasonable.<br> I'll pay you later. I'm broke.<br> - You're what?<br> - I'm flat busted.<br> I don't have $3, much less $3,000.<br> Can you raise it?<br> Yeah, as soon as I get out of jail.<br> Next week's payday,<br> I'll be able to give you $150.<br> If you get me off,<br> I'll give you a promissory note for the rest.<br> Suppose I don't go along with you<br> unless you pay me half the fee?<br> I'll have to take a lawyer<br> the court appoints. I got my defence now.<br> Right? Insanity?<br> I think I'll stick around<br> and make damn sure you get off.<br> - Where do we start?<br> - We're gonna need a psychiatrist.<br> As neither one of us has money...<br> ...do you think<br> the Army'll stir one up for you?<br> I know a colonel in the Pentagon. I'll write.<br> Good, do that. Sulo?<br> Where are you going now?<br> I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.<br> Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?<br> That's right, I did.<br> She's a very pretty woman, your wife.<br> A man gets used to the way his wife looks.<br> Yeah, I guess he does. I'll see you.<br> Come on in, Pauly.<br> You haven't been in here<br> since you vacated.<br> Hardly recognise the old place?<br> Mary did it for me.<br> She just finished a decorator's course.<br> Smart girl.<br> - Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print.<br> - Very nice.<br> Try this chair.<br> It sort of does things for you.<br> Here, sit right down.<br> Great, isn't it?<br> "Good for the nerves," they say.<br> How do you shut it off?<br> Here we are. Feel better?<br> I feel all shook up.<br> I just dropped by to tell you<br> I've got both feet in the Manion case.<br> - You're going to cop out, aren't you?<br> - No.<br> That's a mistake. It's open and shut.<br> Maybe. We'll see.<br> Judge Maitland's in the hospital.<br> Maybe you'd like a continuance<br> until he gets back.<br> If we go now, we'll have to try...<br> ...before some grab-bag judge<br> they'll send in.<br> - I'd rather have Maitland.<br> - Yeah, so would I.<br> But, of course, that also means my client<br> lies around in jail another two...<br> ...or three months before the trial.<br> If you drop the charge<br> down to manslaughter...<br> ...so he can get out on bail,<br> we'll agree to a continuance.<br> You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.<br> I don't know, I might.<br> I might, since a big fat lie-detector test<br> on his wife has given proof...<br> ...to the rape story.<br> The jury'll be with him.<br> How did you know what the lie...<br> - Bit, didn't I?<br> - Yeah, you did.<br> A lie-detector test<br> isn't admissible evidence.<br> You can't use it.<br> No, but it carries moral weight.<br> I wouldn't sit in that chair too much.<br> It could shake a fellow's brains loose.<br> I'll see you later.<br> He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.<br> He likes the beer in my icebox.<br> What's the occasion today, a buffalo hunt?<br> No, I bought these in Arizona<br> when we were stationed there.<br> Aren't they smart?<br> We can sit in my car.<br> Here you are.<br> Several things have occurred to me.<br> The undergarments<br> that Barney Quill tore off:<br> Who has them now? The police?<br> You mean my panties?<br> All right, your panties.<br> I haven't seen them since.<br> I gave the torn skirt and sweater<br> to the police.<br> Then I went with them into the woods<br> to look for the panties...<br> ...but we couldn't find anything<br> but my glasses.<br> Your glasses!<br> You mean,<br> you were wearing glasses through all that?<br> I had them in a case in my hand.<br> I wear them for reading,<br> playing pinball, things like that.<br> I must've tried to get out of the car<br> and dropped them.<br> You might be interested to know<br> that your lie-detector test turned out...<br> ...in your favour.<br> Of course it did.<br> I could've told you it would.<br> You weren't worried about it?<br> No, why should I be?<br> Would you like to have something<br> to worry about?<br> Silly.<br> Like your husband watching us<br> from his cell window?<br> All right, let's have it.<br> Did he say something to you?<br> Just enough. Are you afraid of him?<br> Yes.<br> Is that why you volunteered<br> for a lie-detector test? For him?<br> Yeah.<br> Does he have reason to be jealous?<br> He was jealous<br> even before we were married.<br> I should've known how it would be.<br> It's funny, though.<br> He likes to show me off.<br> He likes me to dress the way I do,<br> and then he gets furious...<br> ...if a man pays any attention to me.<br> I've tried to leave him, but I can't.<br> He begs, I give in.<br> Now, if you think<br> I've forgotten my question, I haven't.<br> I have.<br> Then I'll ask it again. Does your husband<br> have any reason to be jealous?<br> No. Not once.<br> Not ever.<br> Like the place all right?<br> I was just looking at those pictures.<br> That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?<br> - That's right. Barney Quill.<br> - I'm Paul Biegler...<br> I know who you are.<br> I've seen you around Iron City.<br> You didn't tell me your name.<br> Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.<br> That's all right. I can wait.<br> I don't have the shakes yet.<br> You were on the job that night,<br> weren't you?<br> The night Barney Quill was killed.<br> Like the newspaper said, I was present.<br> You were the fellow<br> that stopped Lt. Manion outside.<br> That's right.<br> He pointed the gun at me and said,<br> "You want some too, buster?"<br> And you said no,<br> because your name isn't Buster.<br> Wasn't anything funny about it.<br> No, there wasn't anything... I'm sorry.<br> Where were you<br> when Barney Quill was killed?<br> I gather you don't want to talk<br> about that night?<br> That's right. I don't want to talk about it.<br> You'll have to talk to me about it in court,<br> why not now?<br> 'Cause I don't have to now.<br> Reason enough, okay?<br> Okay.<br> Old Barney, he was<br> kind of a rugged character, wasn't he?<br> Ex-prize fighter and muscleman,<br> and fancy with guns.<br> He paid his debts, ran a clean place.<br> Me, I liked him.<br> You run the place now?<br> No, I just work here.<br> Mary's running things.<br> Mary? Was that Barney's wife?<br> No. He didn't have a wife.<br> Mary was his manager.<br> I wonder who's going to inherit the place.<br> - Mary, I guess.<br> - Mary again, huh?<br> What's the matter with that?<br> You mean, what's the matter with Mary?<br> I don't know.<br> Mary what?<br> Pilant. Mary Pilant.<br> She's in the back booth.<br> We don't talk about our customers here,<br> but if we did, which we don't...<br> That's her. That's Mary Pilant.<br> Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?<br> Sure. I know the lieutenant, too.<br> He's a good officer.<br> She's all right, too. Friendly, a good kid.<br> - What do you know? Knock it off.<br> - I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?<br> What chances has the lieutenant got?<br> Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple<br> of character witnesses like you.<br> I'd like to help him out,<br> I sure would, but we're moving out.<br> The whole outfit. Berlin.<br> Tell me, who is this "babe" at the hotel?<br> Her name is Mary Pilant.<br> She was Quill's private property.<br> - Would you like a table, sir?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Will you be alone?<br> No, I'll be joined by two others.<br> - May I take your hat?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> How was the manicure?<br> Ask me any questions about anybody.<br> I've got all the dope.<br> Can you tell me about a woman<br> by the name of Mary Pilant?<br> Easy. Mary Pilant may<br> or may not have been...<br> ...the mistress of the late B. Quill.<br> The manicurist is in favour<br> of the mistress theory...<br> ...but the hairdresser is against it.<br> However, they both agree that some kind<br> of hanky-panky must've been going on.<br> To be continued.<br> - Menu?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Pretty, huh?<br> - Yes, very pretty. Well, go on.<br> There's one story that says that Barney's<br> wild night with Mrs. Manion was...<br> ...somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.<br> Seemed she'd been seeing some soldier<br> and Barney blew his stack.<br> He got tanked up and exploded.<br> - Is Mary Pilant local?<br> - No, she's a Canadian.<br> Barney brought her in<br> to dress up the place...<br> ...and she stayed on to manage it for him.<br> Looks like she's done all right.<br> It's better than all right.<br> She's in for the estate.<br> She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?<br> Where?<br> What do you mean, "where"?<br> The pretty one with the menus.<br> This girl, right here?<br> Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?<br> I'm Paul Biegler, attorney for Lt. Manion.<br> This is Mrs. Rutledge and Mr. McCarthy,<br> my associates.<br> Could you sit with us for a minute?<br> - Yes, I can take a minute.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'd like to ask you a few things,<br> if you don't mind.<br> What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?<br> Like, what kind of man your employer was?<br> A very nice man.<br> If that's true, how do you explain<br> what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?<br> I don't know what happened<br> with Lt. Manion's wife...<br> ...so there isn't anything for me to explain.<br> Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill<br> is very touching.<br> Barney was well-liked here by everyone,<br> Mr. Biegler.<br> It's very generous to overlook his little<br> faults, like raping other men's wives.<br> If you will pardon me.<br> The waitress will take your order<br> when you're ready.<br> Nice to have met you,<br> Mr. Biegler, Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.<br> You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.<br> Manion?<br> - Any word, Lieutenant?<br> - Yeah, this. From Washington.<br> They'll let a doctor come to testify,<br> but there's a string on it.<br> They want me to go to an army hospital<br> in Detroit for an examination.<br> Doesn't the Army understand<br> you're in jail on a non-bailable offence?<br> That's it, as far as the Army's concerned.<br> I don't know how I can get around this.<br> I'll try to think of something.<br> My wife hasn't been here for two days.<br> - Have you seen her?<br> - No. Not for a while.<br> - Where the hell is she?<br> - You've got other things to worry about.<br> I'll get in touch with her<br> and tell her you miss her.<br> Yeah, you tell her that.<br> - Thanks, Sulo.<br> - Okay, Pauly.<br> I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.<br> I'd be tearing my hair out, too,<br> if I had something like that outside.<br> Something like what outside?<br> You know what I mean. Something<br> like that running around on the loose.<br> Now, what's the big noise, buckos?<br> It's me, dummy.<br> I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.<br> You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?<br> No, but a little bourbon might help.<br> Knock it off, buckos!<br> Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.<br> Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got!<br> Hi, Pauly.<br> That's what they call you, isn't it? Pauly?<br> That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.<br> - Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.<br> - You're not splitting the scene, man?<br> - I mean, you're not cutting out?<br> - No, I'll be back.<br> Hi, Pauly. Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.<br> - Sit down, won't you?<br> - Sorry, I can't right now.<br> Mrs. Manion, may I talk to you<br> for a moment outside?<br> Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped<br> the formalities a long time ago.<br> We'd better pick them up again.<br> This is important.<br> - All right, I'll go with you.<br> - All right, come on.<br> - You're coming back, aren't you?<br> - Sure, what do you think?<br> - See you later, Pie-Eye.<br> - Okay.<br> Did you get my phone message?<br> Yeah, but I got busy.<br> Why haven't you been to see<br> your husband?<br> I don't see why I have to go every day.<br> It would be a very good idea if you did.<br> All right. I'll see him every day.<br> - Okay?<br> - No, it's not okay.<br> - Where's your car?<br> - I came with them.<br> - Mine's right over here.<br> - Now wait, I got friends inside.<br> Friends or not, you're going home.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> I'm the lawyer trying to save your husband.<br> Remember?<br> - What's that got to do with...<br> - You listen to me!<br> Until this is over, you're going to be<br> a meek little housewife...<br> ...with horn-rimmed spectacles.<br> You're going to stay away from men,<br> juke joints, booze and pinball machines.<br> You're gonna wear a skirt<br> and low-heeled shoes.<br> And you're gonna wear a girdle.<br> Especially a girdle.<br> Believe me. I don't usually complain<br> of an attractive jiggle...<br> ...but you save that jiggle<br> for your husband to look at...<br> ...if and when I get him out of jail.<br> Now, come on. Let's go.<br> I'm sorry. I really am.<br> I wouldn't hurt Manny's chances<br> for anything.<br> Come on.<br> Is this about where<br> Barney knocked you down?<br> Yeah. Right over here.<br> Over there's the opening in the fence<br> where Muffy...<br> ...was running back and forth<br> with the flashlight.<br> Where's your trailer?<br> Up there on the hill.<br> This is my favourite place.<br> Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,<br> I'd come out here and just sit.<br> I had to get out of that trailer.<br> I couldn't stand<br> being cooped up all the time.<br> I'm lonely, Paul. I'm awful lonely.<br> I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse<br> if it weren't for that.<br> Maybe you're getting in<br> some good practise for being lonely.<br> You think maybe Manny won't get off?<br> That'll be up to the jury<br> and you never can tell about them.<br> If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.<br> No, I don't mean that.<br> I may think it sometimes,<br> but I don't really want it.<br> Hello, sweetie. Did you miss me?<br> Of course you missed me.<br> You want to come in, Paul?<br> You can if you want to, you know.<br> No, thank you, Laura.<br> I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun<br> over at that place.<br> - Good night, Laura.<br> - Good night.<br> Hear ye, hear ye.<br> The Circuit Court for the County<br> of Iron Cliffs is now in session.<br> You can be seated.<br> For those of you I haven't met,<br> my name is Weaver.<br> I'm from downstate<br> and I'm sitting temporarily...<br> ...while your good Judge Maitland<br> is recovering from a severe illness.<br> There's no need, I think,<br> to dwell at length upon my methods.<br> One judge is quite like another.<br> The only differences may be<br> in the state of their digestions...<br> ...or their proclivities<br> for sleeping on the bench.<br> For myself, I can digest pig iron...<br> ...and while I might appear<br> to doze occasionally, you'll find...<br> ...that I'm easily awakened...<br> ...particularly if shaken gently<br> by a good lawyer...<br> ...with a nice point of law.<br> We will now take up the criminal docket.<br> Case Number 1:<br> The People versus Clarence Madigan.<br> Breaking and entering in the nighttime.<br> Will the defendant rise and come forward?<br> That's me, Your Honour.<br> "State of Michigan, Court of Iron Cliffs.<br> I, Mitch Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...<br> "... come into said county<br> and give the court to understand...<br> "... that Clarence Madigan, alias 'One-Shot<br> Madigan,' alias 'Smoky Madigan'...<br> "... did enter the dwelling of Casper Katz...<br> "... and did there commit the felony<br> of larceny on said premises."<br> Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?<br> No. A man's got to have money<br> to ask them fellows the time of day.<br> Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,<br> it's my duty to appoint an attorney...<br> ...on your behalf.<br> I wouldn't bother, Your Honour.<br> I stole the whiskey. I'm guilty as hell.<br> It was a full case of expensive bourbon.<br> Did you sell this whiskey?<br> No. I drank it.<br> - All of it?<br> - You bet, Judge.<br> Are you aware that it will be necessary<br> to punish you for this crime?<br> It was worth it.<br> I'll accept your plea of guilty.<br> You'll be sentenced later.<br> - You may now return to your place.<br> - Thanks, Your Honour.<br> Case Number 2:<br> The People versus Frederick Manion.<br> The charge: Murder.<br> Paul Biegler for the defendant.<br> My formal appearance is already on file.<br> Which of these men is your client,<br> Mr. Biegler?<br> None of them.<br> Mr. Sheriff, will you produce the prisoner?<br> I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Honour.<br> Perhaps someone should explain.<br> I'm not clairvoyant.<br> The defendant is in Detroit<br> being examined by a psychiatrist.<br> Shouldn't the court have been consulted...<br> ...before the defendant<br> was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?<br> We're dealing with the Army in this matter.<br> They only gave us one crack<br> at one of their psychiatrists.<br> The court was not present<br> and it was urgent...<br> ...to get the defendant to the psychiatrist.<br> What does the attorney for the People say?<br> It was done with my knowledge,<br> Your Honour.<br> I've always heard this Upper Peninsula<br> of our fair state...<br> ...was a queer place.<br> If it's customary here to allow a man<br> charged with first-degree murder...<br> ...to wander about at will,<br> I don't suppose it behoves an outsider...<br> ...to point out that the law makes<br> no provision for such quaint liberalism.<br> The defendant is in the care of a deputy<br> and will be returned this afternoon.<br> We'll formally arraign the defendant<br> on his return.<br> For the sake of the docket,<br> can you give me a clue as to his plea?<br> The defendant will waive reading<br> of the information and stand mute.<br> A plea of not guilty will be entered.<br> The case of Frederick Manion<br> will be placed first on the trial docket.<br> Can you hurry it up?<br> If the judge hears the prisoner<br> was lounging at the railroad station...<br> ...he'll really give it to me.<br> It'll just take a minute. Come over here.<br> Lieutenant, how did things turn out?<br> I was temporarily insane.<br> - Did he tell you that?<br> - Yeah.<br> He said he'd write you a letter,<br> but I took notes on my own.<br> - The doctor's name was Smith.<br> - Smith?<br> Anatole Ludwig Smith<br> or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.<br> - Name like that would impress the jury.<br> - Just plain Matthew Smith.<br> He said when I shot Quill...<br> ...I was suffering from<br> "dissociative reaction."<br> Dissociative reaction.<br> Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?<br> What does it mean in English?<br> It means I had an "irresistible impulse"<br> to shoot Quill.<br> That's okay, isn't it?<br> Did he say you knew the difference...<br> ...between right and wrong<br> when you shot Quill?<br> I don't think he said anything about that.<br> Is that important?<br> We'd better not keep the sheriff waiting.<br> You'd better go.<br> You ever heard of a Michigan court<br> accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?<br> No. Maybe we'd better switch<br> to self-defence.<br> Even Mitch Lodwick<br> would make a monkey out of us on that.<br> Damn strawberry soda.<br> - Here, do you want a peanut?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Tomorrow is Saturday.<br> We just have the weekend before the trial.<br> When do we start working?<br> Tomorrow morning. Early.<br> - Pauly!<br> - Hey, listen to this, Parn.<br> Never mind that. Just find:<br> "People versus Durfee,<br> That's it. I have it right here in the A.L.R.<br> Listen.<br> "The right and wrong test,<br> though deemed unscientific...<br> "... is adhered to by most of the states,<br> but..." Listen to this.<br> "But, the fact that one accused<br> of committing a crime...<br> "... may have been able<br> to comprehend the nature...<br> "... and the consequences of this act...<br> "... and to know that it was wrong,<br> nevertheless..."<br> Dear, sweet, endearing word,<br> "nevertheless."<br> "Nevertheless, if he was forced<br> to its execution by an impulse...<br> "... by an impulse,<br> which he was powerless to control...<br> "... he will be excused from punishment."<br> Why, the Michigan Supreme Court<br> did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.<br> This is precedent.<br> I think we got a hold of something here.<br> Good old Durfee, 1886. How about that?<br> Give me a pad.<br> By the saints, this strawberry soda pop<br> is beginning to taste like whiskey.<br> Don't get drunk yet.<br> We've got to convince a jury...<br> ...that our client was irresistibly impulsed.<br> Remember that.<br> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.<br> Before we proceed, it will be necessary<br> for me to examine you...<br> ...on your qualifications to sit as jurors.<br> Please remember that you are under oath.<br> Are all of you citizens?<br> Will you please raise your hand<br> if you are not?<br> Are there any justices of the peace<br> or law enforcement officers among you?<br> No.<br> Are any of you related by blood<br> or marriage to a law enforcement officer?<br> No.<br> So much for qualifications.<br> I will now examine for cause.<br> Does anyone have business pending with<br> the prosecuting attorney, Mitch Lodwick?<br> No.<br> Does anyone have business pending<br> with Paul Biegler, attorney for the defence?<br> No.<br> Is anyone acquainted with the defendant...<br> ...seated there on Mr. Biegler's left?<br> Will the defendant's wife please stand?<br> - Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?<br> - No.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Manion.<br> You may be seated.<br> Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.<br> Before counsel's challenge, may I introduce<br> Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?<br> Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general<br> from Lansing.<br> Because of the peculiar nature<br> of this case...<br> ...I asked the attorney general<br> for Mr. Dancer to sit with the prosecution.<br> Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.<br> - It's a privilege to have you in my court.<br> - I'm sure it'll be instructive.<br> Do any of you have any business pending<br> before the attorney general's office?<br> No.<br> I must apologise<br> for my disparaging remarks...<br> ...about the Upper Peninsula<br> and its customs.<br> I've seldom seen a murder jury selected<br> and sworn in less than half a day.<br> You've won my heart completely.<br> Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.<br> What's your problem?<br> There was a little suggestion<br> I wanted to make.<br> By all means.<br> Since the defence plea is insanity,<br> the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.<br> By statute, we have the right to request<br> a mental examination by our own doctor.<br> Are you familiar with that statute,<br> Mr. Biegler?<br> Moderately.<br> It would only delay things<br> to file a formal petition...<br> ...so why don't we informally agree...<br> ...to ask for an adjournment?<br> Only a day or so...<br> ...and our doctor can see the defendant.<br> It would save a great deal of time.<br> - Yes, I'm sure it will.<br> - Good.<br> But, suppose you just go ahead<br> and file that formal petition anyway?<br> You're a little late,<br> but maybe His Honour will overlook that.<br> I'd sort of like the jury to see that<br> you think our insanity plea has some merit.<br> There's no need for our doctor<br> to examine your client.<br> - I was only following the usual procedure.<br> - I'm all for it.<br> Do you wish to file the petition?<br> - Yes...<br> - It won't be necessary.<br> It won't be necessary.<br> Skirmish over.<br> Shall we join now on the field of battle?<br> The body of Quill had sustained<br> five gunshot wounds.<br> One of the bullets<br> had passed through the heart.<br> Death, in my opinion,<br> was almost instantaneous...<br> ...and was directly caused by this wound.<br> Dr. Raschid,<br> may I have your detailed report?<br> Certainly.<br> I ask that this report be marked<br> "People's Exhibit 1" for identification.<br> So received and marked.<br> The People hand the defence<br> a copy of the report.<br> Counsel may cross-examine.<br> Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was<br> to ascertain the cause of death, was it not?<br> Yes.<br> Yet I read in your report...<br> ...you checked to determine<br> if spermatogenesis was occurring...<br> ...in the body at the time of death.<br> Objection, Your Honour!<br> The People call this witness<br> only to show the cause of death.<br> Your Honour,<br> the entire report was offered as evidence...<br> ...and it contains this information<br> about spermatogenesis.<br> Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.<br> The witness may answer.<br> Yes, I made that examination<br> on the deceased.<br> Would you tell the court your findings?<br> Spermatogenesis was occurring<br> at the time of death.<br> In other words, the deceased,<br> in life, was not sterile.<br> - He could produce children.<br> - Correct.<br> If a woman says she has had intercourse<br> with a certain man...<br> ...who is proven fertile, though no evidence<br> is found in the woman's body...<br> ...could a lawyer, a prosecuting attorney...<br> ...could he use this as evidence<br> that the woman is lying?<br> Your Honour...<br> ...I object to this line of questioning.<br> We are not concerned here with relations<br> between a man and a woman.<br> As long as an examination<br> for spermatogenesis had been made...<br> ...at least we're entitled to know why.<br> Overruled. You may answer.<br> Yes, prosecution could use that...<br> ...though it certainly would not be<br> conclusive that she was lying.<br> Why not?<br> There could be several reasons<br> why the test on her was negative.<br> The use of a contraceptive...<br> ...or possibly, there was no completion<br> on the part of the man.<br> In this post-mortem,<br> were you asked to determine...<br> ...if the deceased<br> had reached sexual climax...<br> ...shortly before death?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Could you have determined it?<br> - Yes.<br> So, you were only asked<br> to make such examinations...<br> ...that might be useful to the prosecution,<br> but not the defence?<br> I object, Your Honour.<br> The question is argumentative.<br> The defence is trying to impugn the intent<br> of the representatives of the People.<br> Mr. Biegler, you must be aware<br> that the question is improper.<br> I withdraw the question and apologise.<br> The question and answer will be stricken...<br> ...and the jury will disregard<br> both the question and the answer.<br> That's all.<br> No redirect.<br> The People now call Lloyd Burke.<br> Will the witness step forward, please?<br> How can a jury disregard<br> what it has already heard?<br> They can't, Lieutenant.<br> They can't.<br> ...the whole truth and nothing<br> but the truth, so help you God?<br> I do.<br> Will you state your profession, please?<br> I'm a commercial photographer.<br> Were you called upon by the police...<br> ...to take photographs of the body<br> of the deceased, Bernard Quill...<br> ...before and after he was removed<br> from the scene of death?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Were these photographs of the deceased<br> made by you?<br> They were.<br> The recorder will mark these photographs:<br> "People's Exhibit 2A to 2D"<br> for identification.<br> Photographs are tendered to the defence<br> for examination...<br> ...and we move their admission<br> as evidence. Your witness.<br> No questions, no objections.<br> - He took pictures of me that night, too.<br> - Just a minute, Mr. Burke.<br> Mr. Burke, these photographs<br> offered as evidence:<br> Are they the only photographs<br> you took that night?<br> No.<br> The others didn't turn out?<br> All my pictures turn out.<br> Of course. I beg your pardon.<br> Did you give the other pictures<br> to the police?<br> Yes, sir, I did.<br> What were they?<br> Were they side shots<br> or a shot of the moon, perhaps?<br> Or a black bear scavenging<br> in the Thunder Bay dump?<br> I object. I can't see how other photographs<br> are relevant.<br> The photographs<br> were introduced to show...<br> ...that the deceased<br> met with a violent death.<br> Your Honour, any photograph<br> pertaining to the case would be relevant.<br> The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.<br> What were these other photographs of,<br> Mr. Burke?<br> Lt. Manion's wife.<br> These photographs showed how she looked<br> after Barney Quill was killed?<br> - Yes.<br> - Your Honour, how she looked is irrelevant.<br> No evidence has been introduced<br> to connect her appearance to the murder.<br> - Sustained.<br> - I'm sorry, Your Honour.<br> I wanted to be sure the prosecution<br> wasn't withholding evidence.<br> Now, look here!<br> I protest to the defence attorney's<br> persistent attacks...<br> ...on the motives of the prosecution.<br> The jury will disregard the remark made<br> by the attorney for the defence.<br> There is no reason to believe<br> the prosecution hasn't acted in good faith.<br> My apologies to the prosecution<br> and the court.<br> But, Your Honour...<br> ...as long as protests are being made,<br> I'd like to make a protest myself.<br> I'm perfectly willing to take on<br> these two legal giants any time, any place.<br> But, in all fairness,<br> it ought to be one at a time.<br> I don't want these two pitching<br> knuckle balls at me at the same time.<br> It seems to me<br> you're batting close to 1000...<br> ...but your point is well-taken.<br> Whichever attorney opens<br> with the witness...<br> ...he, alone, shall continue<br> with that witness until they are excused.<br> Thank you, Your Honour.<br> No more questions.<br> No questions.<br> We're doing well, aren't we?<br> - Where is Parnell?<br> - Why? Isn't he here?<br> No, nor in his rooming house.<br> He hasn't been there all night.<br> You saw him last. Where is he?<br> I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.<br> He hasn't fallen off the wagon?<br> No. He was sober.<br> Has he gone somewhere?<br> He did borrow my car for something.<br> Your car? That was smart.<br> He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.<br> He'll kill himself. Where's he gone?<br> My word is my bond.<br> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.<br> You may proceed.<br> Your Honour...<br> ...the defence notices a third person<br> at the prosecution's table.<br> We were wondering if the court<br> shares our curiosity about him?<br> I was about to introduce him.<br> Your Honour, this gentleman<br> is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.<br> Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist<br> in this case.<br> We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed<br> to sit at our table as an observer.<br> What will he observe? The constellation<br> of Taurus or the life of a bumblebee?<br> He'll observe the defendant.<br> That's fine.<br> The defence has no objection.<br> I just wish to express my relief...<br> ...that the new recruit is not additional<br> legal reinforcements from Lansing.<br> We call Alphonse Paquette.<br> Raise your right hand, please.<br> You do solemnly swear<br> that the testimony you give...<br> ...shall be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> - I do.<br> - Take the seat, please.<br> Will you state your name, please?<br> Alphonse Paquette.<br> - You work at the Thunder Bay Inn, right?<br> - I'm bartender there.<br> Were you working the night<br> Mr. Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?<br> - I was.<br> - Were you witness to the shooting?<br> I was.<br> Will you tell us in your own words, please,<br> what happened?<br> I was at a table by the door<br> when Lt. Manion came in.<br> Did you know Lt. Manion<br> by sight and name?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Go ahead.<br> He came in and walked over to the bar<br> and began to shoot.<br> He shot Barney<br> when he came up to the bar.<br> When Barney fell, he kept on shooting<br> down at Barney behind the bar.<br> Then he turned and walked out.<br> When Lt. Manion entered the bar,<br> how did he appear to you?<br> Well, he walked slow.<br> Kind of deliberate.<br> Did he speak to Barney Quill?<br> Not a word.<br> He just walked over<br> and pulled out his gun and "bang."<br> - And then he walked out?<br> - Yes.<br> When he walked out,<br> how did he appear to you?<br> He seemed just like he did<br> when he walked in.<br> Like he was the mailman delivering mail.<br> When Lt. Manion walked out of the bar,<br> what did you do?<br> It happened so fast,<br> I guess I was stunned...<br> ...but then I ran after him.<br> - Did you find him outside?<br> - Yes, sir. He was walking away.<br> - Did you speak to him?<br> I said, "Lieutenant,<br> you'd better not run away from this."<br> Did he reply to you?<br> He said, "Do you want some, too, buster?"<br> Was he pointing the gun at you?<br> He was holding the gun in my direction,<br> but the muzzle was low.<br> When he said,<br> "Do you want some, too, buster?"...<br> ...how was that expressed?<br> Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?<br> Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?<br> No, sir. He just said it cool and hard,<br> and looked right at me.<br> Did he appear to you,<br> as far as you could tell...<br> ...to be in complete possession<br> of his faculties?<br> Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.<br> - Your witness.<br> - Did you see Laura Manion...<br> ...Lt. Manion's wife, in the bar that night?<br> There he goes again.<br> This is immaterial and irrelevant.<br> I don't see what the prosecution's<br> jumpy about. I haven't gone any place yet.<br> Let's see where he's going<br> before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.<br> You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.<br> Did you see Mrs. Manion<br> in the bar that night?<br> - She was there.<br> - Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you remember when he returned?<br> Around midnight.<br> From which entrance did he come?<br> Did he come from the lobby entrance<br> or from that outside entrance?<br> It was from the lobby.<br> - How did he appear to you at that time?<br> - How do you mean?<br> You understood the prosecution...<br> ...when he asked<br> about Lt. Manion's appearance.<br> He was just old Barney, like usual.<br> You mean,<br> he was just good old, sober, reliable...<br> ...gentle, salt-of-the-earth,<br> friend-to-man Barney?<br> - What kind of a question is that?<br> - I withdraw the question.<br> Mr. Paquette...<br> ...had Barney changed his clothes<br> since he left the bar?<br> I don't remember.<br> Might his clothing have been different<br> when he returned?<br> That is,<br> might he have changed his clothes?<br> I couldn't say. I didn't notice.<br> Was Barney drinking that night?<br> He always had a few shots<br> while talking to the customers.<br> - He was friendly.<br> - Sure he was, good old Barney.<br> How many shots would you say<br> good old Barney usually had?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> Wasn't he, in fact,<br> pretty loaded that night?<br> Objection.<br> Even if the deceased was dead drunk,<br> it's no defence to this charge.<br> Sustained. I suggest you get off this.<br> Mr. Paquette.<br> What would you call a man<br> with an insatiable penchant for women?<br> A what?<br> A penchant: A desire, a taste, passion.<br> A ladies' man, I guess.<br> Or maybe just a damned fool.<br> Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.<br> The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.<br> What else would you call a man like that?<br> We can't see the drift of this.<br> You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.<br> You may answer.<br> Can you think of another name?<br> - Woman chaser.<br> - Try again.<br> - Masher?<br> - Come now, Mr. Paquette.<br> Mashers went out<br> with whalebone corsets and hairnets.<br> - Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?<br> - Sure, I've heard that.<br> - It just slipped my mind.<br> - Slipped your mind. Naturally, it would.<br> Clanking around in there<br> with those rusty old mashers.<br> Have you ever known a man<br> who you could call a wolf?<br> - I'm not sure.<br> - Was Barney Quill a wolf?<br> - I couldn't say.<br> - Or wouldn't.<br> - Objection.<br> - Sustained.<br> The question was answered.<br> He said he couldn't say.<br> Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned...<br> ...from wherever he had gone...<br> ...did he relieve you at the bar?<br> - Yes.<br> - What did he say?<br> - He said, "I'll take over."<br> Coming out from behind the bar,<br> where did you go?<br> I went over to the Pedersons' table.<br> You testified that you were by the door<br> when Lt. Manion came in.<br> You were by the door<br> because the Pedersons' table was there?<br> Yes.<br> How long was it<br> before Lt. Manion came in?<br> I don't know exactly. Maybe 30 minutes.<br> And you remained with the Pedersons<br> all that time?<br> Yes. They're my friends.<br> Is there also a window beside that table?<br> - I think so.<br> - You think so.<br> How long have you worked<br> at the Thunder Bay Inn?<br> Six or seven years.<br> Does this window beside the table<br> suddenly vanish...<br> ...and then reappear,<br> and come and go in a ghostly fashion?<br> It's there all the time.<br> While you were talking to your friends,<br> did you look out the window?<br> - I might have.<br> - When you looked out...<br> ...were you looking for something?<br> - No, I wasn't looking for anything.<br> Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go<br> to the window and watch out for Manion?<br> Did he tell you to look out for Lt. Manion?<br> He did not.<br> Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?<br> With guns.<br> He'd won prizes for shooting, hadn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> - Did he keep any guns behind the bar?<br> He might have.<br> Isn't it a fact that there are three<br> concealed pistol racks behind the bar?<br> The defendant's plea is one of insanity,<br> not self-defence.<br> I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten that,<br> Mr. Lodwick.<br> You may answer.<br> Are there concealed gun racks<br> behind the bar?<br> - Yes.<br> - How many people know of the gun racks?<br> I couldn't say.<br> Isn't it a fact that Barney<br> would sometimes take the guns out...<br> ...twirling them on his fingers,<br> to demonstrate his skill to the patrons?<br> - I don't remember.<br> - Try and remember.<br> Did you ever see him do that yourself?<br> Once or twice.<br> That's all, Mr. Paquette.<br> No further questions.<br> The witness may step down.<br> Call George Lemon.<br> Biegler's going off in all directions.<br> What's he getting at?<br> I have a feeling he's afraid<br> of what we'll get at.<br> Mr. Biegler's putting up a smoke screen<br> for some reason.<br> - I do.<br> - Take the seat, please.<br> - Will you state your name, please?<br> - George Lemon.<br> What kind of work do you do?<br> I'm caretaker of the tourist park<br> in Thunder Bay.<br> I see the place is clean and orderly.<br> I check people in and out,<br> lock the gate at night.<br> What is your authority for these duties?<br> I'm paid by Mastodon township<br> and I'm also a deputy sheriff...<br> ...just courtesy, sort of.<br> Did you see Lt. Manion<br> on the night of the 15th...<br> ...the night Barney Quill was killed?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Will you tell the court...<br> ...about how and when<br> you saw Lt. Manion?<br> About 1:00 a.m.,<br> a knock on my door waked me up.<br> I went to the door<br> and Lt. Manion was standing there.<br> He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,<br> because I just shot Barney Quill."<br> I told him to go to his trailer<br> and that I would call the police.<br> How did Lt. Manion appear to you<br> when he asked you to take him?<br> He said what he had to and did what I said.<br> There wasn't any fuss.<br> Did he appear to be,<br> as far as you could tell...<br> ...in complete possession of his faculties?<br> As far as I could tell, yes, sir.<br> Take the witness.<br> Mr. Lemon,<br> did you go to the Manions' trailer?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What was her appearance?<br> She was a mess.<br> Objection.<br> No evidence has been introduced...<br> ...to make Mrs. Manion's<br> appearance relevant.<br> No evidence was introduced to make<br> Barney Quill's appearance relevant...<br> ...but you didn't object to that.<br> Is that because you know<br> that Barney Quill bathed and changed...<br> ...after he raped and beat<br> this poor woman?<br> Everybody in this court is being tried<br> except Frederick Manion. I protest...<br> This is a cross-examination<br> in a murder case, not a high-school debate!<br> What are you trying to do,<br> railroad this soldier into the clink?<br> Mr. Biegler,<br> you are an experienced attorney...<br> ...and you know better<br> than to make such an outburst.<br> I will not tolerate<br> intemperance of this sort.<br> If you once again try the patience<br> of this court...<br> ...I shall hold you in contempt.<br> Sorry.<br> Your Honour...<br> ...I apologise.<br> It won't happen again.<br> The witness' answer will be stricken<br> and the jury will disregard the answer.<br> Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Mr. Lemon.<br> On the night when Lt. Manion<br> awakened you and turned himself in...<br> ...had you been awakened before?<br> - Had anything else disturbed your slumber?<br> - No, sir.<br> There were no soldiers singing?<br> No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.<br> There were no women screaming?<br> Those screams were down by the gate.<br> Objection!<br> I see no reason for objecting yet.<br> Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.<br> I didn't hear them myself.<br> Some tourists from Ohio in the park<br> heard them and told me the next day.<br> Mr. Lodwick?<br> This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...<br> ...irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...<br> That's too much for me.<br> The witness is yours.<br> No questions.<br> The witness may step down.<br> Call your next witness.<br> Detective Sgt. James Durgo.<br> - Hi, Pauly.<br> - Hi, Jim.<br> As soon as we break,<br> you'd better phone that Army psychiatrist.<br> - Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.<br> - Will do.<br> Will you please tell me<br> where Parnell has gone?<br> Won't do.<br> You're fired!<br> You can't fire me till you pay me.<br> Were you called to Thunder Bay<br> by Deputy Sheriff Lemon...<br> ...on the night Barney Quill was killed?<br> - Yes, sir, I was.<br> My companion officer and I<br> were first on the case.<br> Sgt. Durgo, when you arrived<br> at the Manion trailer, who was there?<br> Lt. Manion and his wife.<br> What did Lt. Manion say to you?<br> He said his wife had had some trouble<br> with Barney Quill...<br> ...and that he'd gone to the tavern<br> and shot Quill.<br> He asked whether Quill was dead or not,<br> we told him he was.<br> How did Lt. Manion take this information?<br> He didn't seem surprised.<br> What did you do then?<br> I asked for the gun he'd used.<br> Did you take Lt. Manion<br> to the jail here in Iron City that night?<br> Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant down<br> with his wife.<br> On the drive to Iron City,<br> did the lieutenant talk about the shooting?<br> He said that if he could do<br> the whole thing again, he'd still do it.<br> During all this,<br> at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...<br> ...how did Lt. Manion appear?<br> He was very quiet most of the time.<br> Seemed clear-headed.<br> Would you say he was<br> in complete possession of his faculties?<br> He seemed so to me.<br> Your witness.<br> You testified that Lt. Manion<br> told you that he shot Barney Quill...<br> ...after he had learned that his wife<br> had had some trouble with Quill.<br> Were these the words<br> Lt. Manion used: "some trouble"?<br> No, sir. Those were my words, not his.<br> Was it your notion to use your own words?<br> No, sir, it was not.<br> Was the suggestion<br> to call it "some trouble"...<br> ...made by somebody in this courtroom?<br> Yes, sir, it was.<br> Would you tell the court<br> what words Lt. Manion actually used...<br> ...to describe the trouble his wife had?<br> Objection. We've been over this before.<br> This would not be relevant<br> to any issues before the court.<br> The statement "some trouble" came out<br> during the examination of Sgt. Durgo.<br> Up to now, you've adroitly restricted<br> all testimony concerning Laura Manion.<br> The cat's out of the bag,<br> it's fair game for me to chase it.<br> This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,<br> and it's getting sorer.<br> I'd like to hear the prosecution.<br> The burden is on the defence...<br> ...to prove temporary insanity<br> at the time of the shooting.<br> If the reason for the alleged insanity<br> is important to this case...<br> ...then it's a matter<br> for a competent witness.<br> An expert on the subject<br> of the human mind.<br> What the defence is trying to do...<br> ...is introduce some sensational material...<br> ...for the purposes of obscuring<br> the real issues.<br> Your Honour, how can the jury accurately<br> estimate the testimony being given here...<br> ...unless they first know the reason<br> behind this whole trial:<br> Why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?<br> Now, the prosecution would like<br> to separate the motive from the act.<br> That's like trying to take the core<br> from an apple without breaking the skin.<br> The core of our defence is that<br> the defendant's temporary insanity...<br> ...was triggered by this<br> so-called trouble with Quill.<br> I beg the court...<br> I beg the court to let me cut into the apple.<br> Our objection still stands, Your Honour.<br> Objection overruled.<br> Tell the court how Lt. Manion<br> described the trouble...<br> ...his wife had with Barney Quill.<br> He told us that Quill had raped his wife.<br> Can you recall what Lt. Manion<br> told you about the rape?<br> Yes, sir.<br> He said he'd been asleep<br> since right after dinner.<br> He was waked up by some noise,<br> screams, he thought.<br> He got up,<br> opened the trailer door and went outside.<br> His wife came running out of the dark<br> and fell into his arms.<br> You saw his wife in the trailer.<br> How'd she look?<br> She was a little hysterical.<br> She'd been pretty badly beaten up.<br> She had big, black bruises<br> over her face and arms.<br> Did Mrs. Manion tell you<br> about this rape and beating?<br> She did.<br> Did she take you to where it happened?<br> Yes, the next morning.<br> Did you find anything?<br> Any evidence pertaining to the story<br> that Mrs. Manion had told you?<br> On the lane in the woods,<br> we found tyre tracks and dog tracks...<br> ...and a leather case<br> with some horn-rimmed glasses inside.<br> We also looked for a certain undergarment<br> of Mrs. Manion's, but we didn't find it.<br> Will the attorneys for both sides<br> approach the bench, please?<br> Mr. Biegler, you finally got<br> your rape into the case...<br> ...and I think all the details<br> should now be made clear to the jury.<br> Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?<br> Absolutely.<br> What exactly was the undergarment<br> just referred to?<br> Panties, Your Honour.<br> Do you expect this subject<br> to come up again?<br> Yes, sir.<br> There's a certain light connotation<br> attached to the word "panties."<br> Can we find another name for them?<br> I've never heard my wife<br> call them anything else.<br> I'm a bachelor, Your Honour.<br> That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?<br> When I was overseas during the war,<br> Your Honour, I learned a French word.<br> I'm afraid it might be slightly suggestive.<br> Most French words are.<br> All right, gentlemen, back to your places.<br> For the benefit of the jury,<br> but more especially for the spectators...<br> ...the undergarment referred to<br> in the testimony was, to be exact...<br> ...Mrs. Manion's panties.<br> I wanted you to get<br> your snickering over and done with.<br> This pair of panties will be mentioned<br> again in the course of this trial.<br> When it happens, there will not be<br> one laugh, one snicker, one giggle...<br> ...or even one smirk in my courtroom.<br> There isn't anything comic<br> about a pair of panties...<br> ...which figure in the violent death<br> of one man...<br> ...and the possible incarceration of another.<br> Proceed, Mr. Biegler.<br> Did you give Mrs. Manion<br> a lie-detector test?<br> Objection. A polygraph test<br> is inadmissible evidence in our courts.<br> I only asked if he gave the test.<br> I didn't ask the results.<br> He may answer that.<br> I gave her a lie-detector test<br> at her request.<br> Now, after all this investigation,<br> did you believe Mrs. Manion?<br> I did.<br> - Even after the lie-detector test?<br> - I object to that question.<br> It constitutes flagrant subterfuge<br> on the part of the defence counsel.<br> Objection sustained.<br> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,<br> a polygraph or lie-detector test...<br> ...is not admissible in evidence,<br> because no one has ever been sure...<br> ...that some people couldn't lie<br> to a lie detector and get away with it.<br> Go ahead.<br> In any case, Sgt. Durgo, you, yourself,<br> in your own heart and mind...<br> ...are quite convinced<br> of Mrs. Manion's honesty.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - That's all.<br> Just a moment.<br> Did you look for the panties<br> elsewhere than the lane in the woods?<br> We looked in Barney Quill's car<br> and his room in the hotel.<br> We didn't find the panties.<br> Do you know why Mrs. Manion<br> requested a lie-detector test?<br> - I know what she said.<br> - What was that?<br> She wanted everybody to believe her story<br> as she knew it would help her husband.<br> Was that the only reason she gave?<br> Said she'd already sworn to her husband<br> and she wanted everybody to believe it.<br> One moment please, Your Honour.<br> Ask him in what manner she swore.<br> Did Mrs. Manion say<br> how she had sworn to her husband?<br> Yes, sir.<br> She said she had sworn on a rosary.<br> Sergeant, this lane in the woods:<br> What's it used for? Where does it go?<br> It used to be a logging road.<br> Doesn't go any place, just stops.<br> Who uses it now?<br> I think it's a road kids drive down to park.<br> - It's a lovers' lane?<br> - I think so, yes.<br> - The witness is yours.<br> - No more questions.<br> The witness may step down.<br> In view of the evidence concerning rape,<br> which Your Honour has ruled admissible...<br> ...we ask for a 30-minute recess<br> in order that we may...<br> ...bring in a witness<br> we had not anticipated using.<br> All right, we'll take a 30-minute recess.<br> Recess.<br> Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?<br> We forgot it.<br> We didn't forget it. Manny said,<br> maybe we shouldn't tell that again.<br> It might've looked like something else.<br> Like I didn't believe her.<br> How much more didn't you tell me?<br> Everything else.<br> We told you everything else.<br> Is that right, Laura?<br> Yes, everything else.<br> All right, now get this, both of you:<br> When you get up on that stand,<br> I want you to tell the truth.<br> I don't want you to tell anything<br> but the truth.<br> Don't try and lie or conceal anything,<br> or you'll get skinned alive.<br> This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.<br> Doctor Dompierre, did you have occasion<br> to come to the county jail...<br> ...the night of August 15 of this year?<br> I did.<br> - Who called you to the jail?<br> - The police authorities.<br> What did they want you to do?<br> They wanted me to make a test<br> for the presence of sperm...<br> ...on the person<br> of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.<br> I made the test.<br> In making this test,<br> what was your conclusion?<br> Negative. There was none.<br> Your witness, Mr. Biegler.<br> In making these tests,<br> did you notice any bruises or marks...<br> ...on Mrs. Manion at that time?<br> I did.<br> Were you asked about<br> the reason for these bruises?<br> I was not.<br> Where did you do the lab work<br> on your test for sperm?<br> St. Margaret's Hospital in this city.<br> - Who worked up the slides for you?<br> - A technician at the hospital.<br> Wouldn't it have been better to have<br> these slides worked up by a pathologist...<br> ...or an expert in this field?<br> Yes, but the police were in a hurry.<br> I knew this fellow came on at 7:00 a.m.<br> Wouldn't it have been better<br> to wait for the expert...<br> ...if the possible question of rape<br> hung on the result?<br> It would've been.<br> In the newspaper,<br> on the evening of August 16...<br> ...it was stated you found<br> no evidence of rape. Is that true?<br> It is not true. I made no such statement.<br> Did you form an opinion as to<br> whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?<br> - No.<br> - Why didn't you form an opinion?<br> It's impossible to tell if a mature,<br> married woman has been raped.<br> That's all.<br> Did you have an opinion about whether<br> she'd had any recent relations with a man?<br> Insofar as no sperm was present...<br> ...it didn't appear that she had had<br> recent relations with a man.<br> Just one more question:<br> The fact that no evidence was present<br> in her body...<br> ...does not mean that she was not raped,<br> does it?<br> No.<br> Do you know what constitutes rape<br> under the law?<br> Yes, sir. Violation is sufficient for rape.<br> - There need not be a completion.<br> - No further questions.<br> The witness may step down.<br> The People recall Alphonse Paquette<br> to the stand.<br> Your Honour, since counsel for the defence<br> has forced the question of rape...<br> ...it's necessary to take<br> additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.<br> You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.<br> Will you look at Mrs. Manion,<br> seated behind the defence table?<br> Was she dressed like this<br> on the night of the shooting?<br> - No.<br> - How was she dressed?<br> She had on a real tight skirt<br> and sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.<br> She was wearing<br> red shoes with high heels.<br> Was she wearing hose?<br> No, she was bare-legged.<br> - Was she wearing a hat?<br> - No.<br> What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion have<br> under that hat?<br> We'd be very happy to show the court<br> Mrs. Manion's hair.<br> Mrs. Manion,<br> would you take off your hat, please?<br> Thank you, Mr. Biegler.<br> Mr. Paquette, was she wearing glasses<br> that night?<br> I think she was when she played pinball.<br> Considering the tight skirt<br> and the tight sweater and the bare legs...<br> ...what was the result in her appearance?<br> Would you say Mrs. Manion's appearance<br> was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?<br> You could pretty much see<br> everything she had.<br> The defence will concede that Mrs. Manion,<br> when dressed informally...<br> ...is an astonishingly beautiful woman.<br> Mrs. Manion, stand up, please.<br> As a matter of fact, it's pretty easy<br> to understand why her husband...<br> ...became temporarily deranged, seeing<br> such beauty bruised and torn by a beast.<br> I protest.<br> Mr. Biegler is the least disciplined...<br> ...and the most completely out-of-order<br> attorney I've ever seen.<br> The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.<br> Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily<br> that night?<br> I sold her six drinks myself,<br> and then Barney got some more for her.<br> I don't remember how many.<br> Would you say that she was tight?<br> She was high all right.<br> What did she do<br> to make you think she was high?<br> She took off her shoes<br> and went barefooted.<br> When she played pinball...<br> ...she'd swish around<br> to give the machine inkling.<br> You mean,<br> she was flipping her hips around?<br> Anything else?<br> When she made a good score, she jumped<br> up and down and squealed like women do.<br> She was playing pinball<br> with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?<br> What was her attitude<br> toward Barney Quill?<br> Friendly, I guess.<br> More than friendly?<br> - I thought so.<br> - Why did you think so?<br> She'd kind of lean on him...<br> ...and a couple of times<br> she bumped him with her hip.<br> Would you say that Mrs. Manion<br> was making a play for Barney Quill?<br> Objection. That calls for an assumption<br> on the part of the witness.<br> Would you say that Mrs. Manion<br> was free and easy with Barney Quill?<br> I would.<br> Your witness.<br> The attorney for the People asked you<br> if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...<br> ...and you said she was "high."<br> Speaking as a bartender,<br> what's the distinction between the two?<br> I don't think I understand.<br> When we say a person is tight,<br> we usually mean they're a little...<br> ...stupid with drink, isn't that so?<br> I guess that's about it, yes.<br> If they're high,<br> they're gay and enjoying themselves.<br> Yes.<br> In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.<br> Is there anything wrong with being happy<br> in Thunder Bay Inn?<br> Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?<br> Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?<br> Is there anything unusual about seeing<br> a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?<br> So, Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off<br> in Thunder Bay...<br> ...doesn't necessarily mean<br> she was being unladylike, does it?<br> - I guess not.<br> - Yes or no?<br> No.<br> You testified that Mrs. Manion<br> was squealing and jumping up and down...<br> ...and "swishing her hips"<br> around the pinball machine.<br> Was she creating a disturbance?<br> Was she attracting a crowd?<br> Were all the men at the bar<br> standing around watching Mrs. Manion?<br> But you were very conscious<br> of Mrs. Manion.<br> You were so conscious<br> that you can tell us all this.<br> Barney Quill was conscious of Mrs. Manion<br> because he was playing pinball with her.<br> Wouldn't you say so?<br> So, it seems only you and Barney Quill<br> were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion...<br> ...her actions and her appearance.<br> Maybe when good old Barney<br> came to get some drinks from you...<br> ...maybe he winked and said,<br> "I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."<br> No, he didn't.<br> Yeah, and maybe you said,<br> "Do it once for me, boss."<br> Objection!<br> Counsel is attacking the witness.<br> No more questions.<br> The court's had about all of this dogfight<br> it can take for one day.<br> I'm sure the jury<br> is equally tired and hungry.<br> Tomorrow, the defence takes over.<br> With expedition, prayer,<br> and a little self-discipline...<br> ...on the part of the counsel, perhaps<br> we can reach an end by Saturday night.<br> Will you adjourn court?<br> This court stands adjourned<br> until 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.<br> He's banged up a little, but nothing else.<br> We'd like to watch him for a day or so.<br> How much damage did he do?<br> He wrecked a gate and a barn door<br> and he hasn't got a driver's license.<br> He'll have to appear in the J.P. Court<br> when he's able, the old fool.<br> Speak kindly of the dead.<br> - Can I have a minute with the corpse?<br> - Sure, Pauly.<br> Was it worth trying to kill yourself<br> for whatever it is you've been up to?<br> How's the trial going?<br> I'm making a lot of noise.<br> Dancer's racking up all the points.<br> Where've you been?<br> Quill hired Mary Pilant<br> up north of Sault Sainte Marie.<br> It struck me funny he'd go up there<br> to hire somebody just to work for him.<br> I've been up there nosing around.<br> Did you find anything useful?<br> Not until I looked up her birth certificate.<br> Born: Blind River, Ontario, 1934,<br> out of wedlock.<br> Mother was a waitress. Simone Platt.<br> Father was a lumberjack<br> named Barney Quill.<br> I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.<br> It's late, mister.<br> I know. This is important.<br> - Real important?<br> - Real important.<br> Miss Pilant? Sorry if I woke you.<br> There's a guy to see you.<br> Says it's important.<br> - What's your...<br> - Biegler.<br> I don't wish to see him.<br> She said it's not important enough.<br> You call her back and tell her<br> I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.<br> I'll be in the bar.<br> Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?<br> I'll try a little of both.<br> What do you say we start out with a beer?<br> On the house.<br> That's all you get: A beer.<br> No questions, no answers.<br> I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.<br> What are you so afraid of, Al?<br> Sit over there, please.<br> Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.<br> I was a little rough<br> when I was out here before.<br> I didn't know Barney Quill was your father.<br> You didn't come here just to apologise.<br> No, but the apology was part of it.<br> To tell the truth, I sort of hoped<br> maybe it would thaw you out a bit.<br> All I want you to do is listen to me,<br> just for a few minutes.<br> I need some strong evidence to back up<br> Laura Manion's story about the rape.<br> The prosecution's gonna attack<br> that story pretty hard.<br> If the jury thinks she's lying,<br> it could turn the decision against Manion.<br> Isn't she lying? Barney didn't do<br> what she said he did. He couldn't have.<br> What did you know about your father?<br> All I needed to know. He took care of me<br> and my mother for as long as she lived.<br> He was always there when I needed him.<br> That's what I know about my father.<br> Will that back up Laura Manion's story?<br> I don't want to get at you.<br> I don't want to hurt you.<br> I appreciate your affection for your father.<br> But, as a lawyer, I've had to learn<br> that people aren't just good or just bad.<br> People are many things.<br> I kind of have a feeling<br> that Barney Quill was many things.<br> I don't wanna hear it.<br> Please, hear me out.<br> I believe that Barney told Al Paquette...<br> ...what happened that night.<br> He told him to go to this window<br> and wait for Manion.<br> Barney stayed behind the bar,<br> next to a gun rack.<br> Just waiting.<br> Manion came in and fired<br> the minute he got inside that door...<br> ...and the first shot<br> went through Barney's heart.<br> Here's what I want you to do.<br> I want you to try and persuade Al<br> to come to court as a defence witness...<br> ...and tell them exactly<br> what Barney told him that night:<br> That he'd raped<br> and assaulted Mrs. Manion.<br> Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.<br> Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?<br> I don't know.<br> But I know this:<br> Everybody loves something or someone.<br> Me, I love fishing<br> and an old guy by the name of Parnell.<br> Manion loves his freedom,<br> he'd like to have a little more of it.<br> Barney loved you, maybe so does Al.<br> I wouldn't blame him.<br> But he doesn't want to hurt you.<br> He doesn't want you to know the truth:<br> That Barney could be dangerous and brutal.<br> If you just ask Al...<br> If you just ask him straight out...<br> Mr. Biegler knows<br> that Barney was my father.<br> He thinks you know something<br> about the night my father was killed.<br> Something you won't tell.<br> Lawyer, I told you once, I'll tell you again:<br> No questions, no answers.<br> Wait, Al.<br> Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?<br> Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.<br> Is there any reason<br> you wouldn't tell me the truth about that?<br> What reason?<br> Anything else, Mr. Biegler?<br> I'm gonna leave a pass<br> for you and Al at the trial.<br> You might like to watch<br> Lt. Manion get convicted.<br> You gonna talk about<br> Mary being Barney's kid?<br> No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.<br> Thank you for the beer.<br> - Good night.<br> - 'Night.<br> All right, now let's get at this rosary thing.<br> It's been testified<br> that your wife swore to you on a rosary...<br> ...that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.<br> Now, did you ask your wife<br> to swear on a rosary?<br> My wife was hysterical<br> and she wasn't making much sense.<br> I thought if I asked her to take an oath<br> on a rosary it might serve to calm her.<br> Make her think more clearly.<br> Did the rosary help?<br> She was able to tell me, in detail,<br> what had happened.<br> All right, go on from there.<br> Now, what did you do then?<br> I had her lie on the bed<br> and I got some cold cloths for her head.<br> I gave her a drink of brandy.<br> After a while, she became calm<br> and seemed to go to sleep.<br> Then I went to the closet,<br> I got my gun and I loaded it.<br> - Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?<br> - No.<br> Then why did you go to the closet<br> and get your gun and load it?<br> I knew I had to go to his place,<br> I thought I'd need it.<br> Why?<br> I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.<br> I was afraid he might shoot me.<br> Might shoot you if you did what?<br> What were you going to do?<br> I'm not sure.<br> I remember having some idea<br> of finding him...<br> ...and holding him while I called the police.<br> Well, that Mr. What's- his-name...<br> Mr. Lemon at the tourist court<br> was a deputy sheriff.<br> Why didn't you get him to go with you?<br> Maybe because he always seemed to be<br> just the old caretaker of the park.<br> Maybe I wasn't thinking about anything<br> too clearly, except finding Barney Quill.<br> Why didn't you call the state police<br> before you went to the bar?<br> I don't know.<br> I was in sort of a daze.<br> It was a horrible thing to see<br> what had been done to my wife.<br> You say you were in a sort of a daze.<br> When you got to the bar,<br> did you see that the bar was crowded?<br> I didn't see anyone at the bar<br> except Barney Quill.<br> He was the only person I saw.<br> What was he doing?<br> I think he was just standing there<br> behind the bar.<br> Did he make a threatening move<br> to get a gun?<br> I don't know.<br> He may have, I don't know.<br> You say you went there to find him,<br> to hold him for the police?<br> Why did you shoot him?<br> I don't remember shooting him.<br> When you left the bar, do you remember<br> Alphonse Paquette coming up to you...<br> ...saying,<br> "You'd better not run away from this"...<br> ...and your reply,<br> "Do you want some, too, buster?"<br> Remember that?<br> I seem to have a vague recollection<br> of someone speaking to me...<br> ...but I don't remember what I said<br> or what was said to me.<br> When did you realize you'd shot Quill?<br> I was getting a drink of water.<br> I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.<br> When I put the glass down, I saw the gun<br> on the kitchen sink beside the tap.<br> I noticed the gun was empty.<br> I'd like you to show the court and jury...<br> ...just how you knew this gun was empty.<br> This gadget here, when it sticks up,<br> you know the last round's been fired.<br> On the night of the shooting,<br> did you love your wife?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Do you still love her?<br> Very much.<br> The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.<br> How many men have you killed?<br> Now, wait a minute!<br> A man's war record,<br> in Lt. Manion's case a great record...<br> ...shouldn't be used against him.<br> I'm as patriotic as the next man...<br> ...but the simple truth is war can condition<br> a man to killing other men.<br> I just want to know how conditioned...<br> ...the lieutenant may be to the use<br> of firearms on other human beings.<br> I don't like the question...<br> ...but I don't see how I can exclude it.<br> Let him answer.<br> I know I killed at least four men in Korea.<br> Three with a hand grenade<br> and one with my service automatic.<br> I may have killed others.<br> A soldier doesn't always know.<br> In these acts of killing,<br> did you ever have a lapse of memory...<br> ...like when you killed Barney Quill?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Ever have a memory lapse during battle?<br> - No, sir.<br> Were you ever submitted<br> to a constant barrage...<br> ...in a sweat for many hours,<br> constantly under attack?<br> Many times.<br> Ever treated for shellshock<br> or war neurosis?<br> No, sir.<br> Did you ever experience<br> any unusual mental state during the war?<br> - I remember having one great urge.<br> - What was that?<br> To get the hell out and go home.<br> You would do well to consider<br> the seriousness of the situation you are in.<br> Sorry, Your Honour.<br> I sympathise with the lieutenant.<br> I expect he has the same feeling<br> about getting out of jail.<br> The point is that during your service there<br> was never a record of mental disturbance.<br> - You were always completely sane?<br> - Yes, sir, that's right.<br> No more questions.<br> No redirect, Your Honour.<br> Step down, please. Call your next witness.<br> We call Laura Manion to the stand.<br> - Up these stairs to the right.<br> - Thanks.<br> How long after you told your husband<br> what happened did he leave the trailer?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> Everything was kind of fuzzy.<br> I was faint and I lay down on the bed,<br> he sat beside me.<br> I vaguely remember<br> his getting up and going out.<br> I remember wondering if he was going<br> for a doctor, and then he came back in.<br> It seemed like just a few seconds,<br> but it must've been longer.<br> I must've gone to sleep.<br> When he came back in, he sat on the bed<br> and he had a gun in his hand.<br> And I said, "What are you going to do?"<br> He said, "I think I've already done it.<br> I think I've killed Barney Quill."<br> Are you sure he didn't say,<br> "I've killed Barney Quill"?<br> No. I remember distinctly:<br> "I think I've killed Barney Quill."<br> Then what did you do?<br> I put my arms around him<br> and began to cry.<br> I said, "You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."<br> My husband said, "I forgot about that."<br> What did he mean? Forgot about what?<br> He meant he'd forgotten<br> Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.<br> And he said,<br> "Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."<br> I have no other direct questions<br> at this time.<br> But, since I'm sure it's difficult<br> to visualise the part...<br> ...a little dog played on this night...<br> ...I should like to show the court<br> this remarkable little animal.<br> Do the People object?<br> I'm sure if we did...<br> ...Mr. Biegler would declare<br> that we're haters of small, furry animals.<br> A creature that cannot talk<br> will be a welcome relief.<br> Bring in the dog.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Will the deputy bring in the dog, please?<br> Now, you can put him right there.<br> Come on.<br> That's a boy!<br> Now, I'll ask Mrs. Manion<br> to bring a flashlight for the dog.<br> I'll ask the court to notice<br> that the dog turned on the light.<br> It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know<br> who his enemies are.<br> Remove the dog, please.<br> Witness will resume the stand.<br> There we go, Muff.<br> Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you<br> on your well-trained pet.<br> May I also say that I'm pleased to see...<br> ...you are not hiding your lovely hair<br> under a hat.<br> Is the assistant attorney general<br> from Lansing pitching woo...<br> ...or is he going to cross-examine?<br> Let's get on with it.<br> What was your occupation<br> before you were married?<br> Housewife.<br> You were married before?<br> Yes, once.<br> I suppose your first husband died?<br> No.<br> Did you divorce your first husband<br> to marry Lt. Manion?<br> If counsel wants to know the grounds<br> for her divorce, let him ask that question.<br> - What were they?<br> - Mental cruelty.<br> Naturally. How long after your divorce<br> did you marry Lt. Manion?<br> I'm not sure.<br> May I refresh the witness' memory<br> for Mr. Dancer?<br> By all means.<br> I believe she told me that they were<br> married three days after the divorce.<br> - Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?<br> - Yes.<br> Then unless yours was<br> a whirlwind courtship...<br> ...you must've known Lt. Manion<br> before your divorce.<br> Yes.<br> Mrs. Manion,<br> what is your religious affiliation?<br> I'm a Catholic.<br> A Catholic in good standing?<br> No, the divorce, you know.<br> You were ex-communicated<br> because of the divorce?<br> Yes.<br> Wouldn't you say that a Catholic...<br> ...who can blithely ignore<br> one of the cardinal rules of her Church...<br> ...could also easily ignore<br> an oath taken on one of its artefacts?<br> Say, an oath taken on a rosary?<br> I don't think that's true.<br> Wouldn't there be some doubt<br> about the integrity of such a person?<br> I don't know. All I know is<br> the rosary means something to me.<br> I see.<br> I'll pass on to something else.<br> You testified that your husband came<br> home late on the night of the shooting.<br> Were you a little angry<br> about his being late?<br> I guess I was a little put out.<br> - Did you have an argument?<br> - Not much. A little.<br> When you left to go to the inn,<br> did your husband know you were going?<br> He was asleep.<br> Was part of your reason for going without<br> his knowledge because you were vexed?<br> I'd been ironing all day...<br> Yes, I guess that's true.<br> Counsel has deliberately cut off my view<br> of the witness.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't interfere<br> with your signals to Mrs. Manion.<br> I object to the implication I was signalling.<br> This is the shabbiest courtroom trick<br> I've ever seen.<br> You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.<br> I ask the court to rule on my objection.<br> Will you be careful not to place yourself<br> between Mr. Biegler and his witness?<br> Of course, Your Honour.<br> Anything else, Mr. Biegler?<br> You do it again, I'll punt you all the way<br> out into the middle of Lake Superior.<br> Gentlemen, this rowing has got to stop.<br> The next one of you that speaks out of turn<br> will have me to deal with.<br> Now, get on with your cross-examination.<br> Would you have gone to the inn<br> if your husband had been awake?<br> He would have gone with me.<br> Would you have gone alone?<br> - Not if he didn't want me to.<br> - Would he have not wanted you to?<br> I'm not sure.<br> I don't know how to answer that.<br> Had you ever gone<br> to the Thunder Bay Inn...<br> ...or elsewhere in Thunder Bay,<br> alone at night?<br> Yes. Sometimes.<br> Did your husband know you were going?<br> Not always. He goes to sleep early<br> and sometimes I'm restless.<br> Where did you go on these occasions?<br> I'd take a walk by the lake,<br> or to the bingo place, maybe to the inn.<br> Did you ever go to meet another man?<br> No, I didn't. I never did that.<br> You mean to say a lovely woman<br> like yourself, attractive to men...<br> ...lonely, restless, that you never...<br> Objection, the witness has answered<br> the question about other men.<br> Counsel is now making<br> a veiled suggestion to the jury.<br> I withdraw the question.<br> On these occasional excursions into the<br> night, did you always return home alone?<br> Of course.<br> You testified that the reason<br> you got into Barney Quill's car...<br> ...was that you were afraid<br> to go home alone.<br> Why were you so frightened<br> on this particular night?<br> I said that it was because he told me<br> bears had been seen around.<br> Was this the first time you'd heard<br> that bears came around Thunder Bay...<br> ...to pick up scraps?<br> Had you seen the bears before?<br> Yes.<br> This was just the first time<br> you were afraid of them?<br> No. I was always afraid of them.<br> This was just the first time<br> you were enough afraid to allow a man...<br> ...to take you home after an evening prowl?<br> Objection. The use of the word "prowl"<br> is meant to mislead the jury.<br> - Sustained.<br> - I apologise, Mrs. Manion.<br> I didn't mean to imply<br> that you were a huntress.<br> Was this the first time<br> you were enough afraid...<br> ...to allow a man to take you home<br> from one of your evening walks?<br> It wasn't just that. It was...<br> You should be able<br> to answer that straight off.<br> That's a simple enough question.<br> How can the witness answer straight off,<br> if counsel keeps interrupting the answer?<br> The witness seemed a little slow to me,<br> Mr. Biegler.<br> However, let her complete her answers<br> before you interrupt.<br> In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection<br> has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time...<br> ...to think of an answer.<br> You've thought of one, haven't you?<br> What I was going to say was that...<br> ...I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill<br> by making him think I didn't like him.<br> He'd been very pleasant to my husband<br> and me when we'd been in his bar.<br> That's very good. Very good indeed.<br> Your Honour, please.<br> The attorney for the People will reserve<br> his comments for the arguments.<br> I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion:<br> Was this the first time you had been<br> in Barney Quill's car at night?<br> Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?<br> Yes, I heard.<br> Yes, it was the first time.<br> Would you raise your voice a little?<br> I said it was the first time.<br> I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.<br> Would you describe this article<br> of clothing to the courtroom?<br> They were nylon and had lace up the sides.<br> There was a store label in them<br> from the Smartshop in Phoenix, Arizona.<br> What was their colour?<br> - I believe white.<br> - You believe?<br> I have white and pink.<br> They may have been pink.<br> You're not sure. Haven't you checked<br> to see which pair of panties is missing?<br> When your husband came home late<br> and you had this little spat...<br> ...were you already dressed to go out?<br> - No.<br> - When did you dress?<br> After dinner. When he was asleep.<br> It's been stated<br> you were bare-legged in the bar.<br> - Is that true?<br> - Yes.<br> In your anger and haste<br> to get out of the trailer...<br> ...perhaps you forgot your panties?<br> Objection. She testified<br> as to what she was wearing.<br> Sustained.<br> Do you always wear panties?<br> Your Honour,<br> I object to this line of questioning.<br> Now, it's immaterial<br> what she does all the time.<br> The night of the attack,<br> she was wearing panties.<br> That's all we're concerned with.<br> Mrs. Manion seems a little uncertain about<br> what kind of panties she was wearing.<br> Since they've not been found...<br> ...I submit that it's possible<br> she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.<br> That's all I'm getting at.<br> You may answer, Mrs. Manion.<br> Do you always wear panties?<br> No.<br> On what occasions don't you?<br> When you go out alone at night?<br> Objection. He claims to go after<br> one thing and goes after another.<br> I'll sustain the objection.<br> Strike out the last two questions<br> and Mrs. Manion's answers.<br> Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.<br> You've done enough damage.<br> Yes, Your Honour.<br> Mrs. Manion,<br> is your husband a jealous man?<br> He loves me.<br> I'm sure of that,<br> but is he excessively jealous?<br> How can the witness answer that?<br> What's the norm of jealousy?<br> Can you put your question differently,<br> Mr. Dancer?<br> Has your husband ever struck you<br> in a jealous rage?<br> Mr. Dancer's fishing now.<br> What's the relevancy of this question?<br> The shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.<br> In his own words, this isn't a debate,<br> it's a cross-examination in a murder trial.<br> Proceed, Mr. Dancer.<br> Mrs. Manion.<br> Did you ever go out socially<br> in Thunder Bay?<br> A few times.<br> When your husband's outfit moved there...<br> ...didn't Mr. Quill throw a cocktail party<br> for the officers and their wives?<br> Didn't your husband strike<br> a young second lieutenant at this party?<br> There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.<br> - What was it about?<br> - I'm not sure I remember.<br> - Were you too drunk to remember?<br> - No, I was not.<br> I think it was because the lieutenant<br> was cutting in too much...<br> ...when I danced with my husband.<br> Shortly afterwards, on the veranda...<br> ...didn't your husband slap you hard<br> enough so that you fell against the wall?<br> He was drinking.<br> - Wasn't it a jealous rage?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Do you remember why he struck you?<br> - Yes.<br> Wasn't he enraged because he thought<br> you'd encouraged this young lieutenant?<br> He might have thought so.<br> There are witnesses to this.<br> I'll ask you again,<br> wasn't this a jealous rage?<br> I guess you could call it that.<br> Now I'll ask you:<br> On the night of the shooting,<br> what did you swear?<br> What oath did you take on the rosary?<br> It was about Barney Quill raping me.<br> Why did you swear on the rosary<br> that he'd raped you?<br> For the reason that he gave:<br> I was hysterical.<br> That is why he asked you to swear.<br> - Why did you swear?<br> - So he'd believe me.<br> Why shouldn't he?<br> Objection. The reason for the rosary<br> has been established.<br> These questions are immaterial.<br> No, I think I'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.<br> I'll ask you again.<br> Why shouldn't he believe you?<br> Because I wasn't making much sense.<br> Did he think you'd lie about such a thing?<br> Objection. Lt. Manion has already testified<br> as to what he thought.<br> Sustained.<br> Did your husband strike you that night?<br> Did he hit you that night?<br> He may have slapped me<br> because I was hysterical.<br> Didn't you swear to a lie<br> to stop him hitting you?<br> No. I didn't.<br> Didn't he beat you at the gate<br> upon your return from...<br> ...lovers' lane with Quill?<br> Objection. She testified<br> she was beaten by Barney Quill.<br> - Quiet.<br> - No more questions.<br> I think the witness has had enough,<br> Your Honour.<br> The witness may step down.<br> We'll recess for lunch.<br> Recess until 1:00.<br> It's all right, you were fine.<br> Dr. Smith?<br> I've come to meet you, sir.<br> My name is...<br> Sorry, you're mistaken.<br> Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.<br> Are you Mr. Biegler?<br> No, I'm his associate in the case.<br> Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith?<br> That's me.<br> The Army psychiatrist?<br> Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.<br> No.<br> I didn't expect anybody so young.<br> I'm forty.<br> I sort of hoped you'd have a beard<br> and wear a monocle.<br> - Is that better?<br> - It helps.<br> You're on the stand this afternoon.<br> Have you formed an opinion<br> as to Frederick Manion's...<br> ...mental and emotional state<br> when he killed Barney Quill?<br> - I have.<br> - And what is it?<br> He was temporarily insane<br> at the time of the shooting.<br> At that time, do you believe he was able<br> to distinguish right from wrong?<br> He may or may not have been.<br> It doesn't make much difference.<br> As clearly as you can...<br> ...will you explain<br> Manion's temporary insanity?<br> It is known as "dissociative reaction."<br> A psychic shock which creates<br> an almost overwhelming tension...<br> ...which the person in shock must alleviate.<br> In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...<br> ...it is only natural<br> that he would turn to action.<br> Only direct, simple action<br> against Barney Quill...<br> ...would relieve this unbearable tension.<br> This is not uncommon.<br> For example, in combat,<br> some of the more remarkable heroics...<br> ...take place in this state of mind.<br> Is there another name for this state<br> we might be more likely to recognise?<br> Yes, it has been known<br> as "irresistible impulse."<br> A man in the grip of irresistible impulse,<br> would he be likely to go...<br> ...to his neighbour for advice,<br> or call up the police to come to his aid?<br> Completely incompatible.<br> Yes, but our man was able<br> to take out a gun and load it...<br> ...before setting out to find Quill.<br> That was his conscious mind.<br> But if no gun were available,<br> he would've gone anyway.<br> How would a man look<br> in the grip of dissociative reaction?<br> He might appear to be deadly calm,<br> fiercely deliberate.<br> Would you describe his behaviour as being<br> like a mailman delivering the mail?<br> Yes. Like a mailman, he would have<br> a job to do and he would do it.<br> Your witness.<br> Did you find any psychosis<br> in Frederick Manion?<br> - I did not.<br> - Any neurosis?<br> I found no history of neurosis.<br> - Any history of delusion?<br> - None.<br> - Loss of memory?<br> - Not before this instance.<br> Can you spot Mary Pilant?<br> She didn't come back after lunch.<br> I think you'd better give up on that one.<br> Doctor, you stated that the defendant<br> might or might not...<br> ...have been able to distinguish<br> right from wrong...<br> ...but it wouldn't have made a difference.<br> - Is that what you said?<br> - Approximately.<br> So, at the time of the shooting,<br> he could have known the difference?<br> He might have, yes.<br> Dr. Smith...<br> ...if the defendant could have known<br> what he was doing and that it was wrong...<br> ...how can you testify<br> that he was legally insane?<br> I'm not saying he was legally insane.<br> I'm saying that in his condition<br> it wouldn't have made a difference...<br> ...whether he knew right from wrong.<br> He would still have shot Quill.<br> Dr. Smith...<br> ...are you willing to rest your testimony<br> in this case on this opinion?<br> Yes, I am.<br> Your Honour,<br> I'd like to ask for a short recess.<br> We would like to meet with Mr. Biegler<br> and the court in chambers.<br> - Mr. Biegler?<br> - Glad to oblige, Your Honour.<br> Short recess. The jury will remain.<br> Someday I'm going to horrify tradition<br> and lay a dense cloud of tobacco smoke...<br> ...in that hallowed courtroom.<br> What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?<br> In view of Dr. Smith's testimony,<br> the defence might like to change their plea.<br> - Change it to what?<br> - Guilty, of course.<br> No, we'll still go for broke.<br> No one's considered nuts<br> unless he didn't know right from wrong.<br> - Why don't you get this over with?<br> - Your Honour, would you turn to page 486?<br> What's that?<br> Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.<br> I'm sorry, Your Honour.<br> I make those to help me think sometimes.<br> - For perch?<br> - No, it's for frogs.<br> What case is he citing?<br> We gig frogs<br> down in my part of the country.<br> It's the same up here.<br> I'm a trout man,<br> but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.<br> They do it a lot down in the bayou.<br> The idea is to get a great big long pole<br> and a 10-pound line.<br> Just drift along a high bank in a boat.<br> Then you see that great big old bullfrog<br> in a crevice, and you float this along...<br> ...in front of him<br> and that old tongue snaps out.<br> You got frog's legs for supper.<br> I'll be darned.<br> Keep it. Try it sometime.<br> Thanks. I will.<br> - What is it, Your Honour?<br> - People versus Durfee, 1886.<br> Looks like a precedent.<br> Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?<br> No, thank you. I think I recall the case.<br> We're hooked, like the frog.<br> Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive<br> your university training?<br> Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.<br> And where do you practise now?<br> I'm the medical superintendent<br> of the Bonder State Hospital for the insane.<br> It's been stated that dissociative reaction<br> or irresistible impulse...<br> ...is not uncommon<br> among soldiers in combat.<br> - Do you agree with that statement?<br> - I do.<br> But not as it was put by Dr. Smith.<br> Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?<br> Dissociative reaction is not something<br> that comes out of the blue...<br> ...and disappears as quickly.<br> It can only occur,<br> even among soldiers in combat...<br> ...if the individual has a psychoneurotic<br> condition of long standing.<br> It has been testified here<br> that a psychiatric examination...<br> ...of the defendant showed<br> no evidence of neurosis...<br> ...and no history of dissociative reaction.<br> You've also heard it testified<br> that the defendant's behaviour...<br> ...on the night of the shooting<br> was cool and direct.<br> - As an observer, do you remember this?<br> - Yes.<br> Have you formed an opinion<br> about the defendant's sanity...<br> ...on the night of the shooting?<br> Yes. I'm of the opinion...<br> ...that he was in sufficient possession<br> of his faculties...<br> ...so he was not dominated<br> by his unconscious mind.<br> In other words, he was not in the grip<br> of irresistible impulse.<br> In my opinion, he was not.<br> Your witness.<br> Psychiatry is an effort to probe into<br> the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.<br> In there, the world might be round,<br> it could be square.<br> Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's<br> opinion could be right, is that true?<br> I'd be a poor doctor<br> if I didn't agree with that.<br> But, I believe my opinion to be right.<br> Might you have changed your opinion...<br> ...if you'd examined the defendant<br> like Dr. Smith?<br> I don't believe so.<br> But Smith's opinion was made<br> under better circumstances?<br> If you mean that he was able<br> to examine the man, yes.<br> Yes. Thank you, Doctor.<br> That's all, Dr. Harcourt.<br> Is there more rebuttal?<br> We're over a barrel, Mitch.<br> We have to use him.<br> We call Duane Miller to the stand.<br> Will the sheriff bring in the witness?<br> What can he tell?<br> Nothing.<br> He can't tell anything.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear the testimony you give...<br> ...shall be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> I do.<br> State your name, please.<br> Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.<br> Where do you presently reside?<br> Across the alley, in the jail.<br> You know the defendant, Lt. Manion?<br> I got to know him recently.<br> His cell's next to mine.<br> When was your last conversation?<br> Except for "hello" this morning,<br> it was last night.<br> Did you discuss his trial last night?<br> Yeah, some.<br> Would you tell the court<br> what Lt. Manion said about the trial?<br> I said, "Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"<br> He said, "I got it made, buster."<br> He said, "I fooled my lawyer,<br> I fooled that head-shrinker...<br> "... l'm gonna fool<br> those corn-cobbers on the jury."<br> You're a liar!<br> A lousy stinking liar!<br> I apologise for my client, Your Honour.<br> His outburst is almost excusable<br> since the prosecution has seen fit...<br> ...to put a felon on the stand to testify<br> against an officer in the U.S. Army.<br> I don't know who is the worst offender:<br> Manion or his lawyer.<br> We're close to the end.<br> In the name of heaven, let's have peace<br> and courtesy for these last few hours.<br> Mr. Dancer, you will continue<br> your interrogation without comment.<br> Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off<br> at every opportunity.<br> The defendant will remain seated<br> and keep his mouth shut.<br> - Now, go ahead.<br> - Mr. Miller.<br> Are you certain that Lt. Manion said:<br> - "I've got it made, buster"?<br> - That's what he said.<br> - Did Lt. Manion say anything else?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He said when he got out,<br> the first thing he'd do...<br> ...was kick that bitch<br> from here to kingdom come.<br> - To whom was he referring?<br> - To his wife.<br> Your witness, Mr. Biegler.<br> - What're you in jail for, Mr. Miller?<br> - Arson.<br> I copped out<br> and I'm waiting for a sentence.<br> How many other crimes<br> have you committed?<br> I was in reform school when I was a kid,<br> but that's all.<br> I'd like to see this man's criminal record.<br> Do you have his record?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Here it is.<br> Your record shows you've been in prison<br> six times in three different states.<br> Been in three times for arson,<br> twice for assault, once for larceny.<br> It also shows you've done<br> short stretches in four city jails...<br> ...on charges of indecent exposure,<br> window-peeping...<br> ...perjury and disorderly conduct.<br> Is this your true record?<br> Them things are never right.<br> How did you get the ear<br> of the prosecution...<br> ...to tell them about this conversation<br> you had with Lt. Manion?<br> - The D.A. Was taking us to his office.<br> - Taking who?<br> Us prisoners, in the jail.<br> All at once, or one at a time?<br> One at a time.<br> Him and that other lawyer<br> took us to his office...<br> ...and asked us questions about Lt. Manion.<br> Were you promised a lighter sentence<br> if you went on the witness stand?<br> - The People object...<br> - Overruled. Answer.<br> I wasn't promised anything.<br> You just thought it would help you...<br> ...if you dreamed up this story<br> to please the D.A.<br> I didn't dream it up.<br> - You're sure that's what he said?<br> - I'm sure.<br> As sure as you were about your record?<br> I guess I kind of goofed on that one.<br> I don't feel I can dignify this creature<br> with any more questions.<br> Take the witness away.<br> Would you like a conference<br> with your client?<br> I can see how the last witness<br> was quite a surprise.<br> No, we don't need a conference.<br> I'll recall Lt. Manion to the stand right now.<br> You've heard the testimony of this Miller.<br> Is any part of it true?<br> None.<br> Do you have any idea why he might come<br> here with a tale like that?<br> No, sir.<br> Have you ever talked with this man?<br> Yes.<br> What did you talk about?<br> Nothing important.<br> Certainly nothing about my personal life<br> or my feelings.<br> That's all I wanted to know.<br> Lt. Manion.<br> Have you ever had any trouble with Miller?<br> What do you mean?<br> An argument, something like that?<br> Did you ever attack Miller?<br> Physically attack him?<br> Your lawyer can't answer the question<br> for you.<br> Did you ever attack Miller?<br> I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.<br> I pushed his head against the bars once.<br> - Why?<br> - He said something ugly about my wife.<br> Do you remember pushing or bumping<br> his head against the bars?<br> Sure. I just told you.<br> Then this was not dissociative reaction?<br> - The defendant isn't qualified to answer.<br> - Sustained.<br> Lt. Manion.<br> Wasn't your action against Quill<br> the same as your action against Miller...<br> ...and against the lieutenant<br> you struck at the cocktail party?<br> All in the heat of anger, with a wilful,<br> conscious desire to hurt or kill?<br> I don't remember my action against Quill.<br> How long had you known<br> your wife was running around with Quill?<br> I never knew anything like that.<br> I trust my wife.<br> I suppose you beat her up occasionally<br> just for fun?<br> Nothing has been established<br> to permit such a question.<br> He implies things<br> without getting to the point.<br> Let him ask, "Did he ever beat his wife?"<br> I'll sustain the objection.<br> Would you like to rephrase your question?<br> No, thank you.<br> I've finished.<br> Then I'll ask it.<br> Did you ever beat your wife,<br> on the night of the shooting...<br> ...or at any other time?<br> - No.<br> Is there any doubt in your mind<br> that Quill raped Mrs. Manion?<br> - No, sir.<br> - That's all.<br> Step down, Lieutenant.<br> - Are we hurt?<br> - We're hurt bad.<br> Paul.<br> I know time is pressing,<br> I don't want to ask for a recess.<br> I'd like to leave the courtroom briefly.<br> If it's important,<br> we can be at ease for a minute.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> This is highly irregular, Your Honour.<br> There's no reason<br> to make a federal case out of it.<br> Thank you, Your Honour.<br> We now have another rebuttal witness.<br> The defence calls Mary Pilant.<br> We must protest this whole affair.<br> The noble defence attorney<br> rushes to a secret conference...<br> ...and the last-minute witness<br> is brought dramatically in.<br> It's obviously been rigged<br> to unduly excite the jury.<br> It's just another cornball trick.<br> Your Honour, I don't blame Mr. Dancer<br> for feeling put upon.<br> I'm just a humble country lawyer,<br> trying to do my best...<br> ...against this brilliant prosecutor<br> from the big city of Lansing.<br> Swear the witness.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear the testimony you give...<br> ...shall be the truth, the whole truth<br> and nothing but the truth?<br> - I do.<br> - Sit down, please.<br> - Where do you live?<br> - At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.<br> - How long have you lived there?<br> - For two years.<br> - What's your profession?<br> - I manage the inn.<br> Miss Pilant.<br> How is the laundry handled at the inn?<br> It's chuted down to the laundry room.<br> Where is that chute on the second floor?<br> Between Room 42 and 43.<br> Who lives in those rooms?<br> I live in 42, Mr. Quill lived in 43.<br> Would Mr. Quill,<br> coming up from the lobby...<br> ...have to pass by that chute<br> on the way to his room?<br> - Yes.<br> - Would it be easy for him...<br> ...to drop something<br> into that chute as he passed?<br> Yes.<br> Have you ever had occasion<br> to go down into the laundry?<br> Yes. Part of my job is to sort<br> various pieces of laundry...<br> ...as they come out of the machines.<br> Would you tell us<br> what you found among the laundry...<br> ...the day after Mr. Quill was killed?<br> I found a pair of woman's panties.<br> - What did you do with them?<br> - I threw them in the rag bin.<br> When did you learn the significance<br> of those panties?<br> Here. This morning in the courtroom.<br> - You went and got them out of the rag bin?<br> - Yes.<br> - Did you bring them with you?<br> - Yes.<br> I offer this article of lingerie<br> as "Exhibit Number 1" for the defence.<br> They're white.<br> They have lace up the side...<br> ...and they're badly torn.<br> As if they'd been ripped apart<br> by powerful hands.<br> The label reads:<br> "Smartshop, Phoenix, Arizona."<br> If there is no objection,<br> the exhibit will be received in evidence.<br> That's all.<br> Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick<br> about Quill's death?<br> Yes. He came to the hotel several times<br> after Mr. Quill was killed.<br> Did you tell him you didn't believe<br> Quill raped Mrs. Manion?<br> Yes, I told him that.<br> - Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?<br> - Yes.<br> - In connection with Quill's death?<br> - Yes.<br> Did you tell him<br> you didn't believe Quill raped her?<br> - How many times did you talk with him?<br> - Twice.<br> - When was the last time?<br> - Last night.<br> Have you now changed your mind?<br> Do you now believe<br> Quill raped Mrs. Manion?<br> I don't know now. I think he might have.<br> When did you change your mind,<br> last night?<br> No, it was here, this morning.<br> When were you given the panties?<br> Last night?<br> - Just wait a minute!<br> - Use the proper form of objection.<br> On second thought, I don't object.<br> I'd like the jury to hear her answer.<br> The witness may answer.<br> No. I was not given the panties,<br> last night or any other time.<br> I found them exactly as I said.<br> Do you know that Quill<br> put the panties in the chute...<br> ...or did you assume it?<br> - I assumed it.<br> Had you thought someone else<br> may have put them there?<br> Someone who wanted them found<br> in the laundry?<br> I hadn't thought of that.<br> In the grip of what Mr. Biegler<br> might call "irresistible impulse"...<br> ...you rushed in with the panties...<br> ...wanting to crucify Quill's character?<br> - No, it was my duty.<br> - Your pride was hurt, right?<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> He's trying to confuse the witness.<br> Let him ask a question she understands.<br> Yes, Mr. Dancer. I, myself,<br> would like to know what you're driving at.<br> When you found the panties...<br> ...was your first thought that Quill<br> might have raped Mrs. Manion...<br> ...or was it that he might have been<br> stepping out with Mrs. Manion?<br> I don't know what he means.<br> Mr. Dancer, once again, I must ask you...<br> ...to put straight questions to the witness.<br> Here is a straight question, Your Honour.<br> Miss Pilant,<br> were you Barney Quill's mistress?<br> No, I was not!<br> Everyone knows you were living with Quill.<br> That's not true. Barney Quill was...<br> Was what?<br> Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?<br> Barney Quill was my father.<br> No more questions.<br> That's all.<br> The witness may step down.<br> We will recess for 15 minutes, after which<br> we will hear the closing arguments.<br> If possible, I would like to charge the jury<br> before nightfall.<br> Think they're gonna stay out all night?<br> Can't somebody say something?<br> What do you want me to say,<br> Maida, darling?<br> Tell me we're gonna win.<br> I'm counting on getting that<br> promissory note from the lieutenant.<br> I hope we can borrow some money on it.<br> I need a new typewriter.<br> Half the time, the "P" and the "F"<br> don't strike on mine.<br> "Party of the first part" sometimes<br> comes out "arty o the irst art."<br> Doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.<br> "Arty o the irst art"?<br> I kind of like that.<br> It has a ring to it.<br> Twelve people go off into a room.<br> Twelve different minds.<br> Twelve different hearts.<br> Twelve different walks of life.<br> Twelve sets of eyes,<br> ears, shapes and sizes.<br> These twelve people are asked to judge<br> another human being...<br> ...as different from them<br> as they are from each other.<br> In their judgement, they must become<br> of one mind, unanimous.<br> It's one of the miracles of man's<br> disorganised soul that they can do it.<br> In most instances, do it right well.<br> God bless juries.<br> I don't know what I'd do<br> if I were on that jury.<br> I really don't know.<br> Do you?<br> I loved that, Pauly.<br> I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.<br> You had Mr. Dancer dancing.<br> I'm afraid he got in the last dance.<br> That's the best summary I've ever heard.<br> I liked yours much better, Pauly.<br> Do you have to play that?<br> Can't you play Danny Boy<br> or Sweet Isle of Innisfree?<br> Paul Biegler's office.<br> Yes, sir. Right away.<br> They're ready.<br> Hey, sweetie!<br> Go on.<br> - The jury's coming in.<br> - Yeah, I heard.<br> You can tell my loving husband<br> I'll be in the car.<br> - You're sure he's gonna come out?<br> - Sure.<br> He's lucky.<br> Some people have all the luck.<br> You can tell him I'm waiting<br> to get kicked to kingdom come.<br> Hey, sweetie.<br> I have a souvenir for you.<br> You'd better keep that.<br> You might need it again sometime.<br> You never know.<br> No, you don't, do you?<br> I like you, Pauly.<br> I warn all those present<br> not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.<br> I will stop the proceedings<br> and clear the courtroom...<br> ...if there is any demonstration.<br> Proceed, Mr. Cray.<br> Members of the jury, have you a verdict?<br> - If so, who will speak for you?<br> - We have. I'm the foreman.<br> The defendant will rise.<br> What is your verdict?<br> We find the defendant not guilty,<br> by reason of insanity.<br> Did Maida give you that promissory note?<br> Right here,<br> ready to be signed by our happy client.<br> I used to think the world looked better<br> through a glass of whiskey.<br> It doesn't.<br> I think I'll keep it this way.<br> It looks nice.<br> I got one good thing out of this case:<br> A new law partner.<br> If it's all right with him.<br> He'd be mighty proud to have his name<br> on a shingle with yours.<br> I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion,<br> aren't you?<br> He gave me this note for you.<br> Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.<br> She was crying.<br> Left a mess, didn't they?<br> We'd better get busy here.<br> "Dear Mr. Biegler:<br> "So sorry, but I had to leave suddenly.<br> "I was seized by an irresistible impulse.<br> "Frederick Manion."<br> How in the world<br> are we gonna face Maida?<br> Gin.<br> I knew there was something wrong<br> with that guy.<br> I never saw a gin-drinker yet<br> you could trust.<br> Partner, what do you say<br> we go and see our first client?<br> Who might that be?<br> Mary Pilant. We're going to administer<br> Barney Quill's estate.<br> Now, that's what I call<br> poetic justice for everybody.<br> Yeah.<br>
