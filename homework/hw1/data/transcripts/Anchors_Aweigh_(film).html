No, no.<br> She was rather interesting.<br> Oh, interesting.<br> You should have seen the kid work.<br> - I'll tell you, we took the dames home.<br> - You took them home.<br> - Little slow at first. A little slow.<br> - Little slow.<br> I asked my girl for a kiss.<br> - She said no.<br> - Skip the details.<br> - What happened?<br> - Well, I'll tell you.<br> I begged her<br> That's the way he started.<br> I pleaded<br> You should have seen this boy.<br> I told her,<br> "Baby, come out of your shell"<br> I told her,<br> "Maybe you'll find that it's swell"<br> What technique.<br> I argued<br> I never saw such a stubborn dame<br> in my whole life.<br> I threatened<br> And he's got muscles, too.<br> I said,<br> "You can 't send me home, not like this"<br> And I finally got that kiss<br> Tell them, Brooklyn.<br> Tell them how it is.<br> She begged me<br> - True?<br> - True.

Where's the phone?<br> Hello. Hello, Lola. Listen, honey, l...<br> Well, then, who is it?<br> Oh, well, listen, this is Joe Brady.<br> Where's Lola?<br> Did she leave a message for me?<br> Never mind what you'd say!<br> What did Lola say?<br> Well, that's too bad<br> about you too, sister...!<br> Hey. Hey, don't hang up on me.<br> Let's leave a note, will you?<br> Tell her I'll call at 10...<br> Honest, Joe,<br> I can explain the whole thing.<br> Just give me a second,<br> I can explain.<br> You were sleeping like a baby,<br> and I didn't wanna disturb you.<br> I know you need your rest very badly.<br> I know you don't look good unless...<br> Joe, help! Help! Help!<br> Joe, help!<br> It's against the rules, really,<br> but we thought just this once...<br> ...we ought to serve breakfast<br> up here.<br> After all,<br> you've been through so much.<br> Oh, thanks a lot.<br> You must appreciate<br> a buddy like Clarence.<br> Do you know he wouldn't let anyone<br> make a sound all morning?<br> We just crept around like little mice<br> so as not to wake you.<br> I never saw such devotion.<br> Oh, don't think I don't appreciate it.<br> And don't think I won't pay him back.<br> Oh, I'm sure Clarence<br> doesn't expect it.<br> Oh, no. Really, I don't. I'd hate it.<br> You poor, poor boy.<br> Forty-eight days and nights<br> on a raft.<br> Isn't this thrilling?<br> If you want any more coffee,<br> just let us know.<br> - And he looks so shy.<br> - I know, he's so sweet.<br> Joe. Joe, don't you think you ought<br> to eat some of this food?<br> It gets cold very quickly, you know.<br> Why don't you try the eggs.<br> They're very good.<br> Joe, I left you a razor in the shower,<br> there's a towel...<br> Clarence, you can wait on me<br> hand and foot.<br> You can polish my shoes,<br> you can be my slave.<br> But, Clarence...<br> ...it won't do you any good.<br> Because I'm not going to help you<br> with Aunt Susan. Get it?<br> But, Joe...<br> Joe, it isn't Aunt Susan, it's Donald.<br> You promised him<br> you'd go back to see him.<br> Why, it's like breaking<br> the word of honor...<br> ...of the whole United States Navy.<br> Clarence...<br> ...I'm not going back to that house!<br> Look, I get you a date with her,<br> it washes us up.<br> I don't owe you a thing, right?<br> Okay. Here, take all this stuff.<br> It'll make an impression.<br> Let me look at you.<br> Well, it'll have to do.<br> Now, try, will you?<br> - Hello, Aunt Susie.<br> - Why...<br> Hello. Won't you come in?<br> We promised Donald<br> we'd come back and, well...<br> Brooklyn spent the whole afternoon<br> getting him toys.<br> Oh, that's awfully kind of you.<br> - Let's put them over here, huh?<br> - Where's he hiding?<br> Donald? Oh, he's down in school.<br> Thanks to you,<br> he went almost willingly today.<br> Oh, good.<br> Say, aren't you a little young<br> to be bringing up a kid all by yourself?<br> Well, I'm all the family he has.<br> His mother died when he was a baby,<br> and then his father.<br> His father left us this house,<br> and that helps quite a lot.<br> You see, I work,<br> and that keeps me...<br> ...from being with Donald<br> as much as I'd like.<br> I never know when the studio<br> is going to call me.<br> - Gee, are you an actress?<br> - I wanna be a singer.<br> But right now<br> I'm doing extra work in the movies.<br> You ever get a chance<br> to do any singing?<br> No, but there are some<br> really great musicians.<br> There's Stokowski and Jos lturbi and<br> people like that who work in pictures.<br> There's always a chance that<br> I might get to sing for one of them.<br> - Any luck so far?<br> - No.<br> That's awful. That's terrible.<br> Thank you, Clarence.<br> Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.<br> Please forgive me, but I really<br> should run up and dress now.<br> I'm sorry you missed Donald,<br> he'll be disappointed.<br> Well, as a matter of fact, we didn't<br> come just to see Donald, we...<br> Clarence, I'm going to tell her<br> whether you like it or not.<br> Clarence didn't sleep all night,<br> you know.<br> And do you know why?<br> Because he was thinking about you.<br> Why, Clarence.<br> I told him that you'd understand<br> how it is, getting to a strange town...<br> ...when you've been away at sea.<br> "She'll understand," I said,<br> "how important it is...<br> ...when you finally do get<br> a little leave, to meet someone..."<br> Clarence, do you wanna take me out?<br> Is that what all this is leading up to?<br> - "She's a girl with a heart," I said...<br> - Well, I'd love to.<br> Honest?<br> I wish I could make it tonight,<br> but I'm busy.<br> - Boyfriend?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Just someone I met at the studio.<br> He should be here now,<br> so I really have to run up and dress.<br> You did mean what you said<br> about my calling you?<br> Well, of course. Any night that<br> you're free, you just give me a ring.<br> Goodbye.<br> And thank you again for Donald.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> You know, I bet she's not so bad.<br> Gee, I'm glad you like her.<br> I didn't say I liked her,<br> I said she wasn't bad.<br> Yeah, but coming from you.<br> Well, I guess if Aunt Susie likes him,<br> he must be okay.<br> Gee, that's a nice car, isn't it?<br> Hey, what's the matter with you?<br> Aren't you even worried?<br> Once she goes out with him,<br> she'll turn up her nose at any place we...<br> I mean, that you could take her to.<br> Look, this means nothing to me,<br> I'm telling you for your own good.<br> Once she goes out with him,<br> brother, you're dead.<br> - Gee, you think so, Joe?<br> - Sure.<br> There isn't anything I can do about it.<br> Brooklyn, there's always something<br> you can do about everything.<br> Come on.<br> Did you want to see Ms. Abbott?<br> - She's upstairs dressing, I'll call her.<br> - Oh, I wouldn't do that, bud.<br> Susie hates to be bothered<br> when she's dressing.<br> Yeah, she hates it.<br> - Something wrong, jack?<br> - Oh, no. Nothing at all.<br> Well, then squat someplace, jack,<br> you're making me nervous.<br> My name is Bertram Kraler.<br> Bertram?<br> Are you good friends of Ms. Abbott's?<br> You might call it that.<br> - Are you?<br> - I just met her.<br> I'm taking her to dinner.<br> Maybe you know<br> what you're doing, Bertram...<br> ...but I don't think<br> the boys will like it.<br> I beg your pardon? The boys?<br> The Navy. I don't think they're<br> gonna like Susie branching out this way.<br> But I don't quite...<br> Ms. Abbott knows<br> a great many Navy men?<br> Maybe some she doesn't know,<br> say a dozen or two maybe.<br> It's a funny thing.<br> You get onboard a new ship...<br> ...don't know a soul,<br> kind of lonesome even.<br> Then at chow somebody says,<br> "Anybody seen Susie lately?"<br> And right away<br> everybody's talking about her.<br> You know, it's kind of homey,<br> if you see what I mean.<br> Yes. Yes, I do. But, well,<br> she seems such a quiet girl.<br> Susie? Quiet?<br> Well, that's not what the song says<br> when the boys sing about her.<br> They never even mention<br> the word "quiet."<br> They sing about her?<br> The Navy's got a song about her?<br> - Sure.<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - Well, okay.<br> - All right, let me hear it.<br> Well, I don't think you'd better, Bertram.<br> It's strictly for sailors, see?<br> Yeah. Yeah, it's not<br> your type of a song.<br> I insist on hearing it.<br> All right, Brooklyn,<br> if the man insists, let's play.<br> But, Joe, I don't think we ought to.<br> - Go ahead. Play that Susie song.<br> - Well, you start and I'll find you a key.<br> If you knew Susie<br> Like we know Susie<br> Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!<br> She's not so choosy<br> No, not our Susie<br> - Oh, oh...<br> - Susie is a lollapaloozie<br> - When Susie kisses<br> - It never fails<br> When Susie kisses<br> She takes the wind<br> Right out of your sails<br> - So in conclusion<br> - Beware of Susion<br> Oh, oh, oh, what a gal!<br> S is for sincerity<br> Which she's got none of<br> U is for you-know-what-l-mean<br> - S is for...<br> - Sincerity<br> Which she's got none of<br> I is for the Irish in her smile<br> Her Irish smile<br> E is for her eagerness to please us<br> That is how she won her Navy E<br> Put them all together<br> They spell Susie<br> The sweetheart of the boys at sea<br> Oh, that Susie<br> She's a doozy<br> She's not choosy<br> You won 't lose-y<br> - Don 't care who-sie<br> - I mean you-sie<br> You'll get woozy<br> After just one date with Susie<br> When you take her home about 10<br> Another gob is waiting there<br> To take our Susie out again<br> - So in conclusie<br> - Beware of Susie<br> She belongs to you and you and me<br> And the U.S. Navy<br> S, S-U, S-U-S<br> S- U-S-I, S-U-S-l-E<br> Well, well, well.<br> I don't know what's the matter<br> with him, do you, Brooklyn?<br> Yes, and I wish I didn't.<br> Will you please tell Ms. Abbott<br> that Mr. Kraler regrets...<br> Regrets what?<br> What on earth is the matter?<br> What are you two doing here?<br> Mr. Kraler regrets what?<br> I'm afraid there's been<br> a misunderstanding.<br> Knowing your taste as I do now,<br> I'm sure the kind of evening...<br> ...I'd planned wouldn't interest you.<br> S-U-S, S-U...<br> But, Mr. Kraler, l...<br> What did you say to him?<br> - What difference does it make?<br> - I'd like to know.<br> - What did you say to him?<br> - I kind of figured...<br> ...you were stuck with him and...<br> It wasn't Brooklyn, really. It was me.<br> I don't understand why you think<br> I was stuck with him.<br> Well, I thought that you'd be glad<br> to get him off your hands.<br> - I thought you'd be grateful if l...<br> - And you thought I'd be grateful.<br> Well, yes, maybe, l...<br> I mean, if I were a dame and that...<br> If you were a dame and for one solid year<br> you'd been trying to get someplace...<br> ...and you met a man whose mother<br> was in the philharmonic society...<br> ...and who could introduce you<br> to very important people.<br> People like lturbi. I mean...<br> ...I think this is the meanest<br> and the cruelest...<br> Don't cry. Please, don't cry.<br> Aunt Susie.<br> - Oh, go away.<br> - No.<br> I'm sorry. I had no right to brush<br> Bertram off without your okay.<br> Honest, I'm sorry. Please don't cry.<br> Oh, I know you didn't mean it...<br> ...but it's just that<br> I might never get another chance.<br> We've got a better chance for you.<br> That is, Clarence has.<br> It's... Well, it's a surprise.<br> - Well, what kind of a surprise?<br> - Oh, he'd never tell you.<br> That's Clarence all over.<br> You know what he did<br> before he went into the Navy?<br> - He was the assistant...<br> - Joe!<br> Joe, remember<br> what you promised me.<br> Okay. At least I can tell her<br> you were in music, can't I?<br> And he was a big shot too.<br> Why, when you went upstairs<br> to change, he said to me:<br> "You know, if meeting lturbi<br> would do her any good...<br> ...well, after all,<br> he's a friend of mine and..."<br> - He is, Clarence?<br> - They're pals.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I once even heard lturbi say:<br> "It is I who should be grateful<br> to you, Clarence."<br> Remember? At San Diego?<br> Well, you know what Clarence did?<br> He just went to the phone<br> and called his pal lturbi...<br> ...and arranged for you<br> to have an audition, that's all.<br> Oh, Clarence, you didn't.<br> Well, when...? When did he say?<br> - When?<br> - Go ahead, tell her when, Clarence.<br> Saturday. Saturday morning at 11: 15.<br> Oh, Clarence.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's just that it's the nicest thing<br> that anyone has ever done for me and...<br> What did he say?<br> What did you tell him about me?<br> - What does he...?<br> - Look, I've got an idea.<br> No.<br> He has many things to tell you,<br> why don't you go out...<br> ...have dinner and talk it over.<br> - I think that'd be a wonderful idea.<br> - Well, you come too.<br> - Please do, Joe.<br> - Look...<br> ...you haven't got a thing to do<br> until 10:00, remember?<br> - Joe!<br> - Hiya, sailor.<br> You came! You came!<br> Don't tell me you've been<br> at school all this time?<br> Sure, I stayed to tell the teacher<br> what I had to study for the Navy.<br> She sure doesn't know much.<br> You mean you kept the teacher<br> until now?<br> - Of course. Hiya, Clarence.<br> - Hiya, Donald.<br> Come on, I'm gonna march you<br> over to Mrs. Murphy's.<br> - We're going out.<br> - I'll come too.<br> - Oh, no, you won't.<br> - But I gotta talk to Joe.<br> You can just talk to Joe<br> some other time.<br> - When? Tomorrow?<br> - Sure. Sure.<br> Will you come in school to see me?<br> - Aunt Susie is coming tomorrow.<br> - Okay, it's a promise.<br> Come along, darling.<br> Hey, you dope.<br> You wanted a date with her, didn't you?<br> Wanted to be alone?<br> What do you wanna drag me along for?<br> Because I don't know<br> what lturbi said to me on the phone.<br> It's a wishing well.<br> Every time I pass by,<br> I always toss a coin in and make a wish.<br> Thanks to you, I got my wish.<br> Oh, but should I still toss a coin in?<br> You better play it safe.<br> Now it's your turn.<br> No, no, not me. I got a theory called<br> "Wishing Don't Make It So."<br> You decide what you want<br> and then you go out and get it.<br> Come on.<br> - Oh, no, not again enchiladas.<br> - What else?<br> Enchiladas for all of us<br> and all the trimmings.<br> All right.<br> - Now, listen, gentlemen, this is on me.<br> - But you can't spend your money on us.<br> - I'm not.<br> - What are you gonna do? Wash dishes?<br> - Polish the silver?<br> - Scrub the floors?<br> That sounds reasonable.<br> Now, listen, you stay right here...<br> ...and no matter what happens,<br> be brave.<br> - You're all set, I'm gonna go.<br> - You can't leave me alone.<br> How are you gonna get to know her<br> if you're never alone with her?<br> Besides, I wanna phone Lola.<br> We have Ms. Susan Abbott<br> to sing for you.<br> Jealousy<br> You constantly hurt me<br> I sometimes wonder<br> If this spell that I'm under<br> Can only be a melody<br> For I know no one but me<br> Has won your heart<br> But when the music starts<br> My peace departs<br> From the moment they play<br> That languorous strain<br> And we surrender<br> To all its charm once again<br> This jealousy<br> That tortures me<br> Is ecstasy<br> Mysterious pain<br> We dance to a tango of love<br> Your heart beats with mine<br> As we sway<br> Your eyes give the answer<br> I'm dreaming of<br> That soft word<br> Your cruel lips<br> Will never say<br> I fear that the music will end<br> And shatter the spell it may lend<br> To make me believe<br> When your eyes just deceive<br> And it's only the tango you love<br> To make me believe<br> When your eyes just deceive<br> And it's only the tango<br> You love<br> - Where is the phone?<br> - Oh, right up here.<br> Gee, I thought<br> you were wonderful, honest.<br> Joe went to make a phone call.<br> - He's a busy guy.<br> - He is?<br> He's the biggest wolf<br> in the whole Navy.<br> Yeah, they call him the sea wolf.<br> Well, that's what they call him.<br> Clarence, do you realize<br> that I don't know anything about you?<br> I mean, other than you're very nice...<br> ...but tell me about yourself.<br> I'm fine.<br> Well, what sort of work<br> do you do in the Navy?<br> - Gun crew.<br> - Is it interesting?<br> It's keen.<br> - Well, we missed you.<br> - Susita...<br> ...it was not bad this time.<br> It was great.<br> Well, I have wonderful news for you.<br> Guess for whom I'm going to sing<br> this Saturday morning at 11: 15.<br> Jos lturbi. The Jos lturbi.<br> - No.<br> - Yes.<br> Clarence is one of his best friends,<br> and he arranged it for me.<br> Wait, I must run. I must tell Mama.<br> I must tell Pedro. I must tell Manuel.<br> - I must tell everybody.<br> - But it's only an audition...<br> It's no use,<br> it'll be all over the street in five minutes.<br> Susan, you think<br> you ought to tell people?<br> I know you have a wonderful voice...<br> Yeah, but what if everything<br> didn't go just right?<br> Well, you've given me the opportunity,<br> and I want everyone to know about it.<br> If I fail, it's... Well, it's right<br> that they should know that too.<br> Yeah, I guess she's right.<br> Say, Clarence,<br> why don't you dance with Susan.<br> Sure. Do you wanna?<br> I mean, I'd like to if you'd like to.<br> I'd love to.<br> I only know how to waltz...<br> ...and this isn't a...<br> Well, that's too bad.<br> Maybe they'll play one later on.<br> You know, you're a strange team,<br> you two.<br> Clarence is so shy...<br> ...and you're so...<br> Well, you're a sea wolf.<br> Clarence told me you were.<br> Yeah, well,<br> dames are plenty crazy about him.<br> Nice dames, that is.<br> And not about you?<br> Nice dames, that is.<br> Well, I'm an altogether different<br> kind of a guy. You know, l...<br> Well, I'm never serious about things...<br> ...but, well, Clarence,<br> he's always on the level.<br> All right, all right,<br> I know I should have tried, but I didn't.<br> Okay, so I'm a coward.<br> I don't know why, you tell me.<br> Gee whiz, why do I freeze<br> when she looks at me?<br> What makes people act this way<br> about people?<br> What makes anything?<br> What makes the sun set?<br> What makes the moon rise?<br> What makes the tide<br> Remember to hide<br> And why does it soon rise?<br> What makes a star fall?<br> Where does it fall to?<br> Why does its flight<br> Make us stop in the night<br> And wish as we all do?<br> And what holds a cloud together?<br> What makes the sky so blue?<br> What makes the sun set?<br> What makes the moon rise?<br> Is it my love<br> For you?<br> And what holds a cloud together?<br> And what makes the sky so blue?<br> What makes the sun set?<br> What makes the moon rise?<br> Is it my love<br> For you?<br> Gee, you sing just like a bird.<br> - Brooklyn!<br> - Yeah, how do you know?<br> - Flatbush.<br> - Go on. Greenpoint.<br> - How do you like that?<br> - How do you like that?<br> Lmagine meeting a dame<br> all the way from Brooklyn.<br> Ain't it a small world?<br> Like my old lady used to say.<br> Hey, mister, you better sit down, huh?<br> The manager.<br> - Gee, are you all alone?<br> - No, I'm here with a girl. She's dancing.<br> Oh, he's my best friend.<br> Okay, maybe you know<br> what you're doing.<br> She's a swell one, all right, that girl.<br> And what a voice.<br> Yeah, she's wonderful.<br> She's just about the loveliest...<br> Only, you know something?<br> I can never talk to her.<br> I can never talk to girls at all.<br> I never know what to say.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You're talking to me, ain't you?<br> Oh, you...<br> Oh, I mean... I mean, you're different.<br> You're from Brooklyn.<br> Yeah. Yeah, I know.<br> Most girls are so easy<br> to figure out, see?<br> - They are?<br> - Yeah, but you are...<br> One time you look kind of as if<br> you knew all the answers...<br> ...and then 10 minutes later<br> you're just like a little kid.<br> Just when a guy starts thinking<br> he ought to buy you a doll...<br> ...or an ice cream cone<br> or something...<br> ...then all of a sudden<br> you're all grown up again.<br> I am?<br> Yeah.<br> And everything gets all kind of<br> mixed up and interesting.<br> I mean... Well, that's what Clarence<br> said about you.<br> You know,<br> he thinks about you all the time.<br> He does?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> All the time.<br> I guess I'll be seeing you again<br> tomorrow night at the restaurant?<br> - Lf you don't mind going back there.<br> - Oh, I don't mind. It's a swell place.<br> Well.<br> Well.<br> It's been a lovely evening...<br> ...and I don't know when<br> I've been so happy.<br> Good night.<br> Joe, did you hear what she said?<br> She's never been so happy.<br> Yeah, and if you stop to think<br> for a minute...<br> ...maybe you'll figure out why.<br> - You mean lturbi?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why shouldn't she be happy,<br> with that big, beautiful audition...<br> ...you fixed coming up?<br> All of a sudden my heart sings<br> When I remember little things<br> The way you dance<br> And hold me tight<br> The way you kiss<br> And say good night<br> The crazy things we say and do<br> How fun it is to be with you<br> The magic thrill<br> That's in your touch<br> Oh, darling, I love you so much<br> The secret way you press my hand<br> To let me know you understand<br> The wind and rain upon your face<br> The breathless world<br> Of your embrace<br> Your little laugh and half-surprise<br> The starlight gleaming in your eyes<br> Remembering all those little things<br> All of a sudden<br> My heart sings<br> Yes, Mr. Banick, I understand.<br> You've gotta have a pass<br> to get in, sailor.<br> I'll take care of that right away,<br> Mr. Banick. Yes, sir.<br> - Mr. Iturbi work here?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, I'd kind of like to see him.<br> - Is Mr. Iturbi expecting you?<br> - Well, not exactly.<br> - Well, I'm sorry, but it's impossible.<br> I gotta talk to him. It's important.<br> Even just for a minute, can't you?<br> Really, there's nothing I can do. He's<br> very busy. He's on the stage, recording.<br> Gentlemen, bar 95, please.<br> - Roll it, Jim, please.<br> - Speed.<br> So the admiral went up on deck,<br> said to him, he said, "Gunner's Mate...<br> ...Second Class Joe Brady,<br> what do you think we should do?"<br> So Joe said, "Well, sir..."<br> Because even in a battle...<br> ...if you talk to an admiral,<br> you have to say "sir."<br> So Joe said...<br> Joe! Come on, kids, it's Joe.<br> Hi.<br> - I was just telling them about you.<br> - Yeah, so I heard.<br> - Where's Aunt Susie? I thought she...<br> - She had to go to the studio.<br> Listen, Joe, I told the kids you'd tell us<br> all about your adventures.<br> Oh, look, l... Honest...<br> All right, all right.<br> Sit down, sit down.<br> Oh, boy.<br> Tell us how you got your medal.<br> All right,<br> I'll tell you how I got my medal.<br> Now, close your eyes...<br> ...and try to imagine the most<br> beautiful day you've ever seen.<br> The greenest grass<br> and the singing-est birds...<br> ...and the shining-est sun.<br> Can you see it?<br> Yeah.<br> Good. Now, try to imagine me there,<br> walking along, playing a tin whistle...<br> ...just as happy as can be.<br> Do you see me?<br> Yeah.<br> Good. Of course,<br> I was in the Pomeranian navy then...<br> ... and we wore white suits.<br> With blue stripes and a white hat<br> with a little red ball on top.<br> Oh, I was so happy<br> that I ran and jumped...<br> ... and leaped and played,<br> just for the fun of it.<br> My, I felt good.<br> It was such a wonderful,<br> wonderful day.<br> When all of a sudden<br> I stepped into a big hole and fell...<br> ... right to the bottom of it.<br> I seemed to be in a long tunnel.<br> Way ahead, I could see light,<br> so I started towards it.<br> Finally, I reached the end<br> and found myself in a strange land.<br> It looked...<br> Well, it looked just like a page<br> out of a storybook...<br> ... and everything<br> was hushed and still...<br> ... like your room at night<br> after you've gone to sleep.<br> Hello!<br> Hello!<br> Hello!<br> Is anybody here?<br> No music?<br> I can't sing if I want to?<br> Can I dance?<br> - It's a law. It's a law. It's a law.<br> - It's a terrible law.<br> I'll sing and dance whenever I will<br> No law on Earth can keep me still<br> Young man, there is such a law.<br> Our king forbids us to sing and dance.<br> Wait. Where dwells<br> this monster of a king...<br> ...whose people<br> may not dance and sing?<br> In yonder castle,<br> but none can reach him.<br> Trust in me, my honored friend<br> I'll bring your sadness to an end<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello. Who are you?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Just a sailor come a-visiting.<br> Why are you sad?<br> - I'm not sad.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - I am not.<br> - You are so.<br> - Not.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> I'm lonesome.<br> Well, you deserve to be lonesome.<br> Lonesome's too good for you.<br> Passing a law like that,<br> not letting people sing and dance...<br> ...aren't you ashamed of yourself?<br> - I had to.<br> - What do you mean you had to?<br> - Well...<br> A king's gotta do everything<br> his subjects do, see? Only better.<br> Well, I can't sing and I can't dance,<br> so there had to be a law. I had to.<br> You can so sing and dance.<br> Anybody can.<br> Well, not anybody that's cranky<br> and gloomy and grumpy.<br> But anybody whose heart is big<br> and warm and happy, they can.<br> Go on. Try it, just for a minute.<br> Try being happy.<br> If you worry, if you worry<br> - lf you bother your head<br> - I do.<br> It won 't help you, it won 't help you<br> - It will hurt you instead<br> - It will?<br> Grouchers, groaners<br> Cranks and moaners<br> - They're so unfair<br> - I know.<br> If you can 't be gay and merry<br> Lock yourself in solitary<br> Though it hurts you<br> Though it hurts you<br> Be a pleasanter guy<br> You may even learn to like it<br> - lf you give it a try<br> - I'll try.<br> You could laugh and sing and dance<br> As gaily as an elf<br> But don 't expect to get much help<br> If you don 't help yourself<br> - Will you try?<br> - Lf you show me.<br> - I'll show you.<br> - I'll try.<br> Good. One, two, three, four.<br> - One, two, three, four.<br> - One, two, three.<br> One, two, three.<br> - You see?<br> - It's easy.<br> Look at me. I'm dancing.<br> - That's a beautiful story.<br> - And that's how I got my medal.<br> I'm sorry, recess is over.<br> Goodbye.<br> Joe? Joe?<br> What would you like most<br> for a present?<br> Well, don't tell Aunt Susie<br> I told you, now, because it's a secret...<br> ...and she said that you and Clarence<br> fixed it up with a man...<br> ...for her to get a new job<br> and make lots of money.<br> So she's gonna buy us all the most<br> wonderful presents in the world.<br> Joe, what would you rather have<br> than anything?<br> Well, I'll sort of think it over<br> and let you know.<br> Don't tell Aunt Susie I told you, now.<br> No, no, I won't.<br> - Hiya, Brooklyn.<br> - Hello.<br> Joe. Am I glad to see you.<br> Never mind about me.<br> What about you?<br> I got a feeling you didn't<br> get in to see lturbi.<br> We're sunk.<br> I can't get through that gate.<br> What do you mean you can't?<br> Look, Joe, honest.<br> I've tried and tried, but it's no use.<br> You have to have an appointment<br> or something.<br> - Hello.<br> - Yes?<br> My name is Joe Brady,<br> I'd like to see Jos lturbi.<br> - Is he expecting you?<br> - Yes.<br> Just a minute<br> and I'll let you talk to his secretary.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Hello, Jean. A Mr. Brady<br> from the United States Navy...<br> ...to see Mr. Iturbi,<br> says he's expected.<br> Gee, I don't know, Joe.<br> Sometimes when I watch you,<br> I feel that something's wrong with me.<br> Look, Brooklyn, you just gotta learn<br> not to get scared, that's all.<br> Hey, you! You, stop.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Hey, I got a pass.<br> Brooklyn, I got a pass!<br> Wait a minute. Stop.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> - Stop.<br> - Brooklyn!<br> - I guess everybody's out.<br> - Okay, let's go.<br> Pardon me, can you tell me<br> where Mr. Iturbi's office is?<br> - Sure, right over there.<br> - Thanks.<br> Mr. Brady?<br> I expect Mr. Iturbi at any moment.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> Thanks.<br> - Have you been at sea recently?<br> - Yeah, I'm on leave.<br> I suppose you're having<br> a wonderful time.<br> My name is Susan Abbott<br> and someone made an appointment...<br> ...for me to have an audition<br> with Mr. Iturbi this Saturday...<br> - Ever speak to sailors, lady?<br> - Hello, Joe. What are you doing here?<br> Clarence is off having a little chat<br> with Jos and I was waiting for him.<br> We can go out and have a Coke.<br> - I was just...<br> - Ms. Abbott, I'm afraid...<br> Hold on, that's all right, Jean.<br> Tell Mr. Iturbi she'll be back.<br> - But Mr. Iturbi...<br> - Don't worry, I'll be back.<br> Tell him to wait for me.<br> Aunt Susie, you almost made<br> a terrible mistake.<br> I just wanted to ask Mr. Iturbi<br> if there was any song...<br> ...that I should prepare<br> for the audition.<br> That's just what I thought<br> you wanted.<br> Boy, am I glad I was there<br> to stop you.<br> Believe me, Aunt Susie,<br> take my word for it.<br> You shouldn't go even near that guy<br> until the very minute you're ready.<br> But, Joe, why?<br> Well, look, you go see him now,<br> you try to talk to him.<br> He's polite, but he's busy.<br> It's just no good.<br> But you wait till Saturday<br> at 11: 15...<br> ...Iturbi is expecting one<br> of these big, beefy characters.<br> Instead, you walk in.<br> You're all dressed up.<br> You look like a million dollars.<br> Go, Aunt Susie.<br> Believe me, you'll kill him, huh?<br> Come on, sailor, I owe you a Coke.<br> You're sort of Clarence's<br> guardian angel too, aren't you?<br> What I mean is...<br> Well, you're always with him<br> or talking about him. Why, Joe?<br> Well, l... I figured he needed a girl...<br> ...but Clarence didn't want<br> just any girl...<br> ...he wanted somebody<br> he could think about and write to...<br> ...and, you know, come home to.<br> I guess he found her, huh?<br> What about you, Joe?<br> What do you want?<br> - Me?<br> - What kind of girl do you like?<br> Why?<br> I guess I'm just curious.<br> Well, the kind of girl I like<br> is a very definite kind of a girl.<br> Take for example<br> the one I know here in Los Angeles.<br> - You mean Lola.<br> - How...?<br> Well, yeah. Take her, then.<br> Nothing serious about her...<br> I mean, nothing serious,<br> strictly for laughs.<br> She sees you, great. If she doesn't,<br> great, she'll find somebody...<br> ...it doesn't tie you down at all.<br> I see.<br> You don't want to be tied down,<br> do you?<br> That's for guys like Clarence.<br> Nice guys.<br> What I like is...<br> Yes, what do you like?<br> Oh, I don't know, Aunt Susie.<br> Right now I'm a little confused<br> about what I like, it's...<br> - I have a feeling that everything is...<br> - Yes?<br> Back on the set, kids, let's go.<br> Come on, Susie.<br> Everybody works in the next shot,<br> come on.<br> Joe, why don't you come down<br> to the caf tonight.<br> You could bring your girl, you know.<br> Well, maybe Clarence<br> would like to see you alone.<br> All right.<br> Call the Victory Committee<br> and tell them I'll be at the camp.<br> But, Mr. Iturbi,<br> you have to be at the studio.<br> - How are you gonna get to the camp?<br> - I'll be able to make it.<br> Please tell them not to expect me<br> until the last minute.<br> Remember, later on you have<br> an appointment with Carlos.<br> Yes, I remember. I'll be there.<br> And I'll be there on time.<br> Please, stop worrying.<br> Give me the Tchaikovsky concerto.<br> Go and get yourself<br> a double chocolate sundae.<br> - Your next appointment...<br> - With walnuts.<br> With walnuts.<br> Again?<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Ahoy.<br> - Oh, I'm doing fine. Fine.<br> You tune pianos or play them?<br> A little bit of both.<br> Hey, buddy. Hey, I know that song.<br> - Oh, you do, huh?<br> - Sure.<br> Tonight we love while the moon beams<br> Down in dreamland<br> Tonight we touch the stars<br> Love was ours<br> - Oh, sure, I like that.<br> - You like Tchaikovsky?<br> - Who?<br> - Tchaikovsky, the composer.<br> You must be mistaken, buddy.<br> Freddy Martin wrote that.<br> I heard it on the radio<br> at least a thousand times.<br> Well, you know, all those fellows,<br> they steal from each other.<br> Meant to borrow<br> But tomorrow<br> I forgot the words<br> - Yeah, that's nice.<br> - I'm glad you like it.<br> Say, do you know<br> what I would do if I were you?<br> I'd quit this piano tuning,<br> ain't no future in it.<br> - You play very well.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's very nice to be encouraged.<br> You seem pretty good yourself.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Well, I got to go now.<br> I have a few more pianos to tune.<br> Well, goodbye, sailor. Thanks again.<br> - Keep plugging.<br> - Okay.<br> Senor Clarence, friend of Susita.<br> Senor Clarence.<br> The whole street is talking<br> of what you are doing for our Susita.<br> Yeah. I got a date with her.<br> Oh, how happy she will be<br> to see you. Come.<br> Sit down,<br> make yourself comfortable.<br> But I must rush<br> and tell her that you are here.<br> Senor lturbi. He is well, yes?<br> Oh, sure. Sure, he's well.<br> Well, for heaven's sakes,<br> look who's here...<br> ...and looking like he's at a wake.<br> - Hiya, Brooklyn.<br> Yeah, I got a date with Susan.<br> - What's the matter? Don't you like her?<br> - Sure, I like her. I think she's wonderful.<br> Only, I'm gonna be all alone with her.<br> And I'll sit here like a dope, I know it.<br> - I won't even know what to say.<br> - What are you worrying about?<br> The first note I heard you sing...<br> ...I knew you were<br> the romantical-type fella.<br> Quit your kidding. Think I'm just gonna<br> walk up to her and start singing?<br> Of course you don't just walk up to her<br> and start singing. Look.<br> I'm her.<br> I'm just finishing dinner,<br> toying with my coffee.<br> The fellas are beating<br> their brains out playing soft music.<br> I'm looking at you...<br> ...you're looking at me.<br> Okay, take it.<br> Gee, you're swell.<br> Gee, thanks.<br> That's right, that's the way.<br> The charm of you<br> Is comparable to<br> A Christmas tree with toys<br> With little girls and boys<br> When first they see<br> The tree<br> The thrill of you<br> Is comparable to<br> The thrill I felt when I<br> First learned the heart could sigh<br> And you were the reason why<br> And yet, and yet<br> If we two had never met<br> I'd know your grace<br> That warms the face<br> That only the angels get<br> And so comparing you<br> With all of these things is all<br> That I can do<br> Because they add up to<br> The charm of you<br> Gee, I'd give a month's tips...<br> ...to have somebody sing<br> words like that to me.<br> Somebody will, Brooklyn.<br> What do you bet?<br> Some girls, when a fella comes<br> to see her, he brings flowers...<br> ...orchids even.<br> I'm the other type girl.<br> Me, a fella brings four bottles of beer.<br> What's the sense of kidding myself?<br> What are you talking yourself down for?<br> You're a terrific girl.<br> Oh, go on.<br> - I'd better get working.<br> - Hey, Brooklyn. Hey, I think you're...<br> Oh, hello, Clarence.<br> I hope you haven't been waiting long.<br> - Well, l...<br> - What did you say?<br> I didn't say anything.<br> I didn't say a word.<br> Did you have a nice time<br> with Mr. Iturbi today?<br> L... I saw Joe at the studio<br> and he said you were there.<br> You know, Clarence...<br> ...I feel as though Saturday<br> will never come. I can hardly wait.<br> Well, it's natural, I guess.<br> Until I'm doing it, l...<br> I just can't believe that<br> I'm really going to sing for Mr. Iturbi.<br> Susan, look,<br> there's something I've got to tell you.<br> It may make a difference in the way<br> you feel about seeing me, even.<br> But I've got to tell you.<br> Well, please, Clarence,<br> don't tell me now.<br> I like you very much...<br> ...but we haven't known<br> each other very long...<br> ...and sometimes it's a mistake<br> to say things too soon.<br> - Do you think so?<br> - Oh, yes, I do.<br> Now I feel better.<br> I was afraid to tell you anyway.<br> By the way, where is Joe tonight?<br> Joe probably has a date with Lola.<br> He's crazy about her.<br> I mean, she's crazy about him,<br> and he doesn't seem to mind it.<br> That's just to hold you.<br> Now, don't forget,<br> I got one wish coming.<br> Let's keep the whole thing quiet, huh?<br> Clarence, you're wonderful.<br> You know, Clarence, I can't begin<br> to tell you how grateful I am.<br> Oh, gee, Aunt Susan,<br> it's really nothing, l...<br> But I've waited all my life<br> for a chance like this.<br> - Oh, mister, I'm so sorry.<br> - That's all right. It hardly touched me.<br> Wanna come to the kitchen?<br> Couple minutes next to that oven<br> and you'll be dry.<br> Yes, Clarence,<br> you'd better go ahead. Hurry.<br> So I says to myself,<br> "Half of every year for 18 years...<br> ...your feet get cold,<br> hands get chapped, nose gets blue.<br> Get smart, get out of town," I said.<br> So here I come to sunny California.<br> Sure, my nose don't get blue anymore,<br> but the rest of me is blue all the time.<br> You're homesick, that's what.<br> Yeah.<br> I guess you're dry, I guess.<br> I guess.<br> Well...<br> She's gone.<br> No kidding?<br> Don't worry, she must have gone up<br> to her dressing room to change.<br> She'll be back in a minute.<br> You know something?<br> With you around, even with<br> the palm trees and this stuff...<br> ...this feels like Brooklyn.<br> Gee, thanks.<br> You're welcome.<br> The customers are sitting in the inside<br> and the waitress sits outside.<br> - Hiya, Joe.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I wanted to see you. You having fun?<br> - Oh, I'm having a swell time.<br> - Sure. All you needed was a girl.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Say, you'd better get back to her.<br> What are you doing out here, anyway?<br> Listen, Joe, it's kind of tough...<br> ...what with the excitement and all<br> about her audition.<br> Don't you think I'd better tell her?<br> Oh, that's what I came down<br> to see you about.<br> I thought not getting to lturbi<br> might cramp your style with Susie...<br> ...so I found out<br> where we could see him.<br> Tomorrow, the first thing,<br> at the Hollywood Bowl.<br> So don't worry, everything's gonna be<br> okay with you and Susan.<br> - Thanks, Joe.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hollywood Bowl.<br> - Yeah, Hollywood Bowl.<br> - Mr. Iturbi is in there, isn't he?<br> - Yes, he is.<br> We're friends of his,<br> we'd like to see him.<br> I'm sorry, boys,<br> I wish I could let you in, but I can't.<br> Nobody is allowed in there<br> during rehearsals.<br> I got a dream I dream all the time,<br> I go up to a cop and he says:<br> "Glad to see you, come right in."<br> - So we give up, huh?<br> - So we don't give up, huh.<br> Come on, we got him cornered.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, all. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, goodbye.<br> - Hey, where's lturbi?<br> Oh, he just left.<br> And he's eight minutes late. Oh, dear.<br> Hey.<br> Even you can be late, Joe.<br> We just tell Susan the truth.<br> That's all there is to do.<br> Okay, I'll go.<br> Joe?<br> I'll tell her.<br> It's up to me to do it, not you.<br> Now, look, I'll go out to the studio<br> and tell her it's all a phony.<br> She'll be good and sore,<br> but at me, right?<br> I'll tell her how I pulled you into it...<br> ...and how it all happened<br> because you're crazy about her.<br> What's the use, Joe? We're due<br> back in San Diego tomorrow...<br> ...and our leave is up.<br> - What difference does that make?<br> Susan's not a girl just for a leave.<br> Well...<br> She's the kind<br> you come home to and...<br> - Well, this will do it.<br> - Joe?<br> Yeah?<br> There's something I've been...<br> Yeah, yeah,<br> I guess you're right. Okay.<br> I'll meet you at that little barn<br> near Susie's house about 6.<br> That way I can tell you<br> how she took it.<br> Unless you wanna come with me.<br> Are you just gonna sit here?<br> Yeah, yeah, I'm tired.<br> I fall in love<br> Too easily<br> I fall in love<br> Too fast<br> I fall in love<br> Too terribly hard<br> For love to ever last<br> My heart should be well-schooled<br> 'Cause I've been fooled<br> In the past<br> And still I fall in love too easily<br> I fall in love<br> Too fast<br> Brooklyn, I love you.<br> Oh, no. No, you love Susie.<br> I did, but I don't.<br> I know it's awful, but I can't help it.<br> I love you.<br> I don't think it's so terrible.<br> Yes, it is.<br> There is Joe, off telling Susie<br> that I want to come home to her...<br> ...and here I want<br> to come home to you.<br> Gee, I got a feeling I'm...<br> I got a feeling I'm fickle.<br> You're gonna marry me, aren't you?<br> But, Brooklyn...<br> Before I say for sure,<br> there's something I gotta tell you.<br> So that everything will be<br> on the level, see?<br> No, no. Whatever happened<br> before you met me, it doesn't count.<br> But this was after I met you.<br> It was?<br> I don't care.<br> You still don't have to tell me.<br> But I wanna. I gotta.<br> Well, last night, when I dropped<br> the soup on you by accident...<br> ...it wasn't no accident.<br> I didn't want you<br> to sit there with her.<br> Why, Brooklyn...<br> ...that's just about the nicest thing<br> that anyone has ever done for me.<br> Imagine, you were jealous.<br> But, honey, you better tell your pal<br> to stop fixing it up with Susan.<br> - Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.<br> - Yeah.<br> Because bigamy, I don't believe in.<br> Everybody on the set for the morning<br> at 9:00 sharp.<br> Susie.<br> Can I speak to you for a minute?<br> What would you like to say?<br> - Well, l...<br> - Perhaps I could tell you.<br> Clarence is a very fine boy,<br> that I know.<br> You saved his life,<br> so you owe him something.<br> You've decided<br> that he's just about right for me.<br> Does that cover everything?<br> No, that doesn't come<br> anywhere near it.<br> Oh, I forgot.<br> You like a very definite type of girl...<br> ...and I'm very definitely not it.<br> Oh, don't be mad, Aunt Susie.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What is it, Joe?<br> Susie, what I wanna say...<br> Well, it's not awfully...<br> Same thing happens every time<br> I'm with you.<br> I hear myself saying words...<br> ...that never have anything to do<br> with the things I feel about you.<br> All I know are the things you say, Joe,<br> and I don't like them.<br> Susan, I've never said to you...<br> ...what I really<br> wanted to say because...<br> I guess because my way of saying it<br> just isn't good enough.<br> - Then there must be some other way.<br> - Sure there is.<br> Comes right out of Romeo and Juliet,<br> Three Musketeers...<br> ...and all the books and poems.<br> Those are the words<br> I wanna say, but...<br> I can't. You'd laugh at me.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Well, then I'd laugh at myself.<br> Words like that don't go<br> with sailor suits...<br> ...and three-day leaves<br> and the world we live in.<br> They go with that world,<br> cloaks and swords and...<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> If you lived in that house,<br> then I could tell you.<br> But I do live in that house.<br> If you lived in that house...<br> ...in some other time, you'd be...<br> You'd be a princess...<br> ...and I'd be a bandit chief<br> who had to hide out in the hills.<br> A bandit who had seen<br> the princess once...<br> ...and having seen her,<br> could never forget her.<br> Then one night,<br> he'd risk his life to see her again.<br> Hiding in a shadow here,<br> a patch of darkness there...<br> Hiya, Clarence.<br> - Joe.<br> - Yeah?<br> You...<br> Nothing.<br> - Clarence.<br> - Yeah, Joe?<br> It's been a hot day.<br> Give me a Scotch. A double.<br> Are you used to that stuff?<br> No, I never touch it.<br> It cuts down on your wind.<br> Yeah.<br> It's been a hot day.<br> - Look, Joe...<br> - No, Clarence, you look.<br> Clarence, sometimes things happen<br> and you just can't help them, see?<br> You meet somebody and you don't think<br> it's anything, and then...<br> ...all of a sudden it is something.<br> Gee, that's exactly<br> the way it happened.<br> Don't I know.<br> It's...<br> It's wonderful, though.<br> It could be.<br> But not when you double-cross a pal.<br> When did you find out, Joe?<br> Today.<br> But I've had a hunch about it<br> pretty nearly from the beginning.<br> - You did?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's funny, I didn't.<br> Not for sure. Not till I kissed her.<br> Of course, last night<br> when she dropped her soup on me...<br> ...I should have known.<br> The waitress?<br> Yeah.<br> Gee, she's a terrible waitress.<br> You mean you're not sore, Joe?<br> No, no. I'm not sore.<br> No, I forgive you.<br> Is she sore? Susan?<br> Susan? No, I wouldn't say<br> she acted sore. No, not at all.<br> Even when you told her that there<br> wasn't gonna be any audition?<br> Joe.<br> You mean you didn't tell her?<br> Well, what did you tell her?<br> What could you be talking about<br> all this time?<br> Just things.<br> You know how it is with things.<br> Joe, you're in love<br> with Susan yourself.<br> - You gonna ask her to marry you?<br> - Sure.<br> Well, when? Before or after<br> she doesn't have her audition?<br> Lturbi.<br> Iturbi. I gotta get to lturbi.<br> But where? I don't know where.<br> Oh, Clarence, where can he be?<br> He's gotta light someplace sometime.<br> There's gotta be someplace<br> he calls home.<br> Home.<br> Home.<br> Good morning. Well, thank you.<br> Can I help you gentlemen?<br> Well, we were looking for Mr. Iturbi.<br> Will he be in this morning?<br> He gave a concert<br> at Bakersfield last night.<br> And when he returns<br> he'll probably go straight to the studio.<br> Is there any message?<br> Well...<br> - No. No, thanks.<br> - Very well.<br> Gee, that's awful.<br> What are you gonna do, Joe?<br> Well, I'll go to her house<br> and stop her before she leaves.<br> Now, look,<br> don't let this spoil it for you, kid.<br> You go see your girl,<br> you haven't got much time.<br> I'll meet you at the bus.<br> You want me to go with you?<br> No.<br> Joe, I was afraid<br> I wouldn't get to see you again.<br> What, you think I'd go away<br> without saying goodbye?<br> Aunt Susie isn't home.<br> She went to the studio.<br> Look.<br> Donald.<br> I've gotta go back to my ship...<br> ...and I don't know if I'll get to see<br> Aunt Susan again or not.<br> - So will you tell her something for me?<br> - Sure.<br> - Sure, Joe.<br> - Okay, you tell her that...<br> ...I tried awfully hard to make things<br> come out right and that...<br> ...I'm awfully sorry<br> that it had to end this way.<br> You got that?<br> - Good morning, Mr. Iturbi.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Here's your coffee and doughnut.<br> - Thank you, dear.<br> Mr. Iturbi, I'm so excited.<br> Imagine running into you this morning<br> of all mornings.<br> Do so hope I won't be<br> a disappointment to you.<br> - A disappointment? To me?<br> - How silly of me.<br> You don't even know who I am,<br> do you?<br> - Well, I'm Susan Abbott.<br> - Oh, that's nice.<br> You know,<br> your friends told you about me.<br> Clarence and Joe.<br> And, well, this is going to be<br> quite a day for me.<br> It looks like quite a day for me too.<br> You know, I had rather expected<br> that Joe would be with you today...<br> ...but I'm sort of glad he isn't,<br> that would make me too nervous.<br> - You don't know him very well, do you?<br> - Not really well.<br> You'd love him<br> because he's really a wonderful person.<br> Well, what I mean is that...<br> - Well, he's Clarence's best friend and...<br> - Oh, he's Clarence's best friend?<br> And I know Clarence very well,<br> don't I?<br> You'd hardly be giving me<br> an audition if you didn't.<br> An audition.<br> And when is it going to be,<br> this audition?<br> You didn't remember it?<br> Well, it isn't exactly<br> that I didn't remember.<br> It's that...<br> It's that you didn't know<br> anything about it.<br> That there never was really<br> an audition at all.<br> Oh, Mr. Iturbi, I'm terribly sorry.<br> See, it's just that Joe and Clarence...<br> Joe and Clarence told me<br> that they had arranged for...<br> What I mean is that...<br> It is a joke. I can see that now.<br> Please forgive me.<br> Wait. Wait for a minute.<br> These boys,<br> you like them very much, yes?<br> Especially this Joe. Don't you?<br> Yes.<br> To throw away a friend in anger,<br> this is not good.<br> And perhaps, if we talk a little<br> about this terrible situation...<br> ...perhaps it will turn out<br> not to be so terrible.<br> - Camera ready.<br> - All right.<br> From the heart of a lonely poet<br> Came a song for the girl he adored<br> Though she tried very hard<br> Not to show it<br> She was terribly, terribly bored<br> But then the poet asked her<br> If she'd like a walk<br> And her eyes shone<br> And the moon shone<br> And the stars shone<br> Up above<br> And they walked<br> Through the evening together<br> They were swaying<br> To the music of a drum and violin<br> He held her and told her he'd love her<br> Till the moon faded above her<br> As they walked<br> Though she tried not to show it<br> She was certain<br> She'd fallen in love<br> And her eyes shone<br> And the moon shone<br> And the stars shone<br> Up above<br> And they walked<br> Through the evening together<br> They were swaying<br> To the music of a drum and violin<br> The spell of the moon<br> Fell upon them<br> And the stardust<br> Breathed upon them<br> As they walked<br> Though she tried not to show it<br> You could see in her eyes a light<br> She was certain<br> She'd fallen in love<br> As they walked<br> Through the thrill of the night<br> - Why don't you write her a letter.<br> - Because there isn't anything to say.<br> Well, tell her you're sorry.<br> - She knows I'm sorry.<br> - How does she know?<br> Oh, Clarence, will you<br> write Brooklyn a letter...<br> ...or wash some socks<br> or go to sleep or something?<br> Carry on.<br> You boys were looking for me.<br> What did you want to see me about?<br> Well, I...<br> - It's too late now.<br> - That, of course, I can tell.<br> Come, come along. We'll talk it over.<br> - Come on, I haven't got much time.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Brooklyn, what are you doing here?<br> - Are you complaining, honey?<br> Joe, you stay right here.<br> Don't go away.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> today I invited myself to your concert.<br> And because I felt it might be<br> of special interest to you...<br> ...I requested Admiral Hammond to grant<br> a young artist permission...<br> ...to make her debut right here.<br> Therefore,<br> allow me to introduce to you...<br> ...a singer discovered<br> by the United States Navy.<br> Miss Susan Abbott.<br> In about five minutes,<br> I will introduce to you...<br> ...a young singer discovered<br> by the United States Navy.<br> Anchors aweigh, my boys<br> Anchors aweigh<br> Farewell to college joys<br> We sail at break of day<br> Through our last night on shore<br> Drink to the foam<br> Until we meet once more<br> Here's wishing you<br> A happy voyage home<br> Anchors aweigh<br>
