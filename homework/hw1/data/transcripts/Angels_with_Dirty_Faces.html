                        Bull's-eye.<br> - It's dead as a doornail around here.<br> - Yeah.<br> How about seeing a picture, Rocky?<br> There's one at the Academy on 14th.<br> - Yeah, what?<br> - Covered Wagon. It's new, just come out.<br> - You got any dough?<br> - No. You got any?<br> No.<br> Oh, look. There's Rocky Sullivan.<br> Walk right by him like we don't see him.<br> Hey, Rocky, there's Laury Martin coming.<br> So what?<br> Oh, my books, they're coming loose.<br> Say, that ain't a bad-looking doll,<br> that one in the middle.<br> - The one with the pretzel legs.<br> - He means you, Laury.<br> - Why, the fresh...<br> - Don't be so smart-alecky, Rocky Sullivan.<br> - Go on. Beat it, pigtails.<br> - Trying to show off, ain't you?<br> - Scram, before I wipe the street with you.<br> - You better wipe your nose first.<br> - Is that so? I'll fix you.<br> - You better scram. You know the Rocky.<br> - Come on.<br> - Leave me alone, I can handle him.<br> Wait till I get down there. I'll fix you.<br> - I'll slap you down.<br> - Oh! Why, you, you...<br> Shut up.<br> Come on. Let's get out of here,<br> dig up some corn.<br> You won't get away with that, Rocky.<br> I'll get even someday. You just wait.<br> Say, maybe this winter we can<br> hop a freight to Florida.<br> They say you can go swimming there,<br> even in January.<br> Sure, we can even hop one to California<br> if we wanted to.<br> Look here, "Rubelin Coal Company,<br> Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."<br> It's too bad it ain't winter. We could<br> grab a couple bags of those coals.<br> "Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."<br> I wonder what's in there.<br> Come on. Let's take a look.<br> It's loaded full of cases.<br> Fountain pens. Hundreds of them.<br> - We can break that easy.<br> - We shouldn't, we don't need those pens.<br> - It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.<br> - We can sell them.<br> Now, listen.<br> What we don't take, we ain't got.<br> Look around. See what you can find<br> to break that lock.<br> All right, whoever's in here,<br> come on out.<br> Come on out, I say!<br> - What's the trouble?<br> - Just a couple of kids. I heard them.<br> Come on out of there.<br> Come on, you hoodlums.<br> You won't get away.<br> - Come out, or I'll come in after you.<br> - Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now.<br> Come on, Rocky! Jump!<br> Hi, Snowflakes.<br> - Hi, Jerry.<br> - Hello.<br> What do you hear? What do you say?<br> Sit down.<br> - How they treating you, Rocky?<br> - Like a prince.<br> I get three square meals and real butter<br> on my bread. What a life.<br> - Is that a bad cut on your eye?<br> - Not bad. Just a few stitches.<br> I thought you knocked your eye out.<br> You coming to my trial tomorrow?<br> Rocky, I've been worrying about<br> this all last night.<br> - I can't let you take the whole blame.<br> - Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?<br> Now get this. You got away, didn't you?<br> Okay. I wanna be a sucker.<br> But, Rocky, maybe if they thought<br> I was in on it, they'd go easier on you.<br> In a pig's eye. Just because you can run<br> faster, you don't gotta eat yourself.<br> - But it ain't fair to you, Rocky.<br> - Look, so they send me up. So what?<br> What've I got to lose? The old man's<br> got troubles enough without me. Forget it.<br> I got caught, and you got away.<br> But you, Rocky. Supposing I was the one<br> who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet.<br> - You'd make them send you up too.<br> - What do you think I am?<br> - I'd lay dead just like you're gonna do.<br> - You would?<br> Sure. Always remember, don't be a sucker.<br> I'm pulling every string I can.<br> I'm seeing the right people.<br> - I can get you off with about three years.<br> - You talk like I can do it in a handstand.<br> That ain't no picnic. You'll be outside<br> having it soft on cushions.<br> It's tough. I'm not gonna mark time.<br> I'll scout around, make connections.<br> - Not only for me, for both of us.<br> - Why should I take the fall?<br> There's no other way out. Be sensible.<br> If they get me, I'll be disbarred. They'll<br> check my vault box and grab the 100 grand.<br> You don't want to lose that dough,<br> do you?<br> All right, Frazier.<br> It's my rap, and I'll take it...<br> ...but it's my 100 grand, and I'll take<br> that, too, the day I get out. Look...<br> I know you're a smart lawyer,<br> very smart...<br> ...but don't get smart with me.<br> Very good, boys. That's all.<br> Wait till I get you outside, mug-face.<br> I'll immobilize you.<br> Yeah? You and your old maid!<br> Come in.<br> What's on your mind, son?<br> Not very much, Father. It's just been<br> bothering me for 15 years.<br> What did you do with those fountain pens<br> you stole?<br> - Rocky! You old...<br> - Jerry, glad to see you.<br> - What do you hear? What do you say?<br> - I'm glad to see you.<br> Good to see you.<br> Fifteen years.<br> Hasn't changed a bit.<br> - You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.<br> - Remember it?<br> He used to stand right where you are<br> and boil the tar out of me.<br> Gosh, 15 years. It doesn't seem possible<br> I haven't seen you in that length of time.<br> - I've seen you.<br> - You have? Where?<br> I was there when you made<br> the 90-yard run against NYU.<br> - Why didn't you come back and see me?<br> - Some people were waiting for me.<br> - Oh. Well, I got a kick coming, though.<br> - You have? What?<br> - Why haven't you written to me?<br> - You know how it is, Jerry.<br> I changed my address and number<br> so often, you had no way to answer me.<br> You know what happens to letters<br> written in the stir. Everybody reads them.<br> When I was inside, nothing happened.<br> When I was out...<br> ...it was all there to read<br> on the front page.<br> Yes, I read all the papers.<br> - You certainly make a good-looking priest.<br> - Thanks.<br> Your mother always wanted you to do it,<br> but what finally decided you?<br> Well, I was riding along on the top<br> of a bus...<br> ...looking down, passing the cathedral.<br> - That gave you the idea, huh?<br> That's funny, I got an idea on the top<br> of a bus once. Got me six years.<br> I was around while you were<br> singing with the kids...<br> ...and I kept thinking of you and me<br> - With Father Boyle.<br> - Yeah.<br> Remember slipping "Merry Oldsmobile"<br> into the hymnbook?<br> - How could I forget it?<br> - How'd it go?<br> Lead, kindly light<br> Amid the encircling gloom<br> Lead thou me on, for the night is dark<br> And I am far from...<br> - Did a lot of crazy things in those days.<br> - Certainly did. Certainly did.<br> Come in.<br> Father, you're supposed to be down at<br> the store. The fellas are waiting for you.<br> You run and tell them I'll be right over.<br> Tell them to get the game started.<br> - Okay, Father!<br> - All right.<br> What's this store racket?<br> Got the kids shilling for the parish?<br> That's not a bad idea, Rocky.<br> No. It's a pet scheme of mine.<br> - A recreation spot for the kids.<br> - Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?<br> No, it's for the big fellas too.<br> You'd be surprised how tremendously it's<br> helped to keep the kids from becoming...<br> Hoodlums like me?<br> - You've cost me a lot of prayer.<br> - I've been in kind of a retreat myself.<br> - Yes. Will you be here for some time?<br> - Depends. I got a little business to attend.<br> - I gotta find a place to live.<br> - Get a room here in the parish.<br> - Not a bad idea. No place like home.<br> - Yes, and it's great to have you home.<br> - I came back to take a look at your kisser.<br> - Stick around and take a lot of them.<br> This is Maggione's. Go in and get a<br> furnished room. Remember her, don't you?<br> Took a lot of good lead pipe<br> out of that cellar.<br> Church is just around the corner.<br> I can drop in to see you from time to time.<br> - See you at Mass Sunday?<br> - Sure. I'll help you with your collection.<br> - It's a deal.<br> - Fair enough.<br> - Mrs. Maggione at home?<br> - What do you want?<br> Looking for a room.<br> My mother ain't here, but the lady<br> in number two will show you the rooms.<br> Yes?<br> Yes?<br> I'm looking for a room. Mrs. Maggione's<br> kid told me you'd take care of that.<br> Yes. I'll get the key.<br> Third floor.<br> There's something about your face<br> that looks awfully familiar.<br> - You've been looking at the funny papers.<br> - No, really.<br> Listen, sister, all I'm looking for<br> is a room.<br> Here it is.<br> Mrs. Maggione will give it<br> a good cleaning.<br> - It's all right. I've seen worse.<br> - I guess you have.<br> - I'll take the room. What's the tariff?<br> - Five dollars a week.<br> - Sold.<br> - In advance.<br> All right.<br> Write me a receipt.<br> You can trust me.<br> How did you happen to come<br> to this house?<br> Looking for references, huh?<br> An old friend of mine sent me over here.<br> Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish.<br> - You know him?<br> - Father Jerry?<br> Yeah. Does that send me in?<br> Oh, I get it now. You're Rocky Sullivan.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Remember me?<br> - No.<br> - Laury Martin?<br> Laury Martin? That little fresh kid<br> with the pigtails?<br> Well, hello. What do you hear?<br> What do you say?<br> Hello.<br> - Hey! Wait a minute!<br> - I've waited 15 years to do that!<br> I wanna see Jim Frazier.<br> - I wanna see Frazier.<br> - He's busy.<br> - I'll wait.<br> - Who are you?<br> - Rocky Sullivan.<br> - Oh. Come on.<br> Number one. Clear the board.<br> Wait here.<br> - There's somebody to see you.<br> - Yeah? Who?<br> Rocky Sullivan.<br> - Rocky Sullivan?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Does he know I'm here?<br> - Sure. Didn't you want me to tell him?<br> That's all right. Send him in.<br> Well, well, Rocky! This is a surprise.<br> - What do you hear? What do you say?<br> - I had the date on the calendar.<br> I thought it was next month. Otherwise<br> I would've met you with a brass band.<br> I thought it was funny you didn't show,<br> but you've been busy the last three years.<br> You got a swell layout here.<br> Looks like you're in the dough.<br> - Yes, only... Well, you know Mac Keefer.<br> - Mac Keefer? Yeah, heard of him.<br> - He owns the town. Can buy and sell it.<br> - Only he doesn't buy it. He sells it.<br> - That's soft, eh?<br> - Softer than that store cot...<br> ...l've been sleeping on<br> for the last three years.<br> - Well, you're out now, Rocky.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where's that dough?<br> - What? The hundred grand?<br> I had it for you, only as I said,<br> I didn't expect...<br> - I know. You said it before.<br> - You don't have to worry about it.<br> - I'm not worried.<br> - I'll have it by the end of the week.<br> In the meantime, I suppose you'd like<br> some spending money. Here, here's 500.<br> I'll take that. It'll take me<br> a few days to get settled.<br> By that time, you can get that dough<br> together and tell me where I come in.<br> Where you come in? What do you mean?<br> What business you want me to handle,<br> what parts of town and what my cut is.<br> - Your cut?<br> - Yeah. That was the idea, wasn't it?<br> I took the rap, three years. You took<br> the dough, made connections, built it up.<br> For you and me. Wasn't that it?<br> Oh, I see. Yes. I understand...<br> ...but you've got this thing all wrong.<br> See, I work for Keefer. He's the boss.<br> I haven't anything to say.<br> If you want a spot in his business, why...<br> ...you'll have to take it up with him.<br> Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up<br> with anybody but you.<br> You figure it out for yourself.<br> I'm taking up with you where I left off.<br> That was the agreement,<br> and we're going to stick to it. Got it?<br> - Well, yes, but...<br> - But what?<br> Well...<br> - Hello, Mac.<br> - Am I breaking in on anything here, Jim?<br> No, not at all. Come right in.<br> I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.<br> Pleased to meet you, Sullivan.<br> I know all about you. You're okay.<br> - When did you get out?<br> - Couple days ago.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Looking around.<br> - Maybe I might have a spot for you.<br> - We were just talking about that.<br> - Where you stopping?<br> - A room at my old neighborhood...<br> ...on Dock Street, number 24.<br> Well, I'll blow now.<br> I'll drop up, say, Monday?<br> - Monday? That'll be fine.<br> - I'm going downtown. I'll give you a lift.<br> - Thanks.<br> - See you later, Jim.<br> Monday.<br> Get me Steve.<br> There's a fella leaving with Mac.<br> I want you to...<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah, I got a good look.<br> Yeah, yeah. I got it.<br> Sure, I'll take care of him.<br> Out of the way, blubberhead.<br> The famine is on.<br> Guys, want some cigarettes?<br> All you guys can have cigarettes off me.<br> You better pack them now, boys.<br> Here comes the beef trust.<br> How do you do?<br> - A nickel you don't conk him.<br> - All right, a nickel I do.<br> - You missed him, chump.<br> - Yeah. A nickel apiece you owe.<br> That cop don't walk right or something.<br> - Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic.<br> - You'd think they'd learn where...<br> ...a tomato comes from in police college.<br> Look.<br> Hello, toots. You want the bottle?<br> You want the bottle? Oh, nuts.<br> Hey! What are you doing with my baby?<br> "Hey! What are you doing with my baby?"<br> Here's your baby!<br> - You loafer! I'll get the cops after you!<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> The way he talks, you'd think<br> he had something there.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hey. Look at the dude.<br> - Come on. Let's give him the works.<br> - All right, kiddo.<br> - Hey, watch out!<br> - Give me that!<br> I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!<br> All right, come on! Let's go!<br> Like taking candy from a baby.<br> How'd you get it, Crab?<br> I hoisted it over the transom<br> in the alley and dropped it.<br> - The corner caught me right in the dome.<br> - So long as it didn't break the machine.<br> Boy, we'll be in the money now.<br> Six nickels and two slugs.<br> Imagine crooks like that?<br> Putting slugs in a slot machine.<br> - Chiselers.<br> - I'm gonna break this thing...<br> Pipe down.<br> - It's only Soapy and the gang.<br> - That's good.<br> Hi, Soapy!<br> - Soapy, look what we got.<br> - You should see the hook I got.<br> It's the most I got in my life.<br> - We got a sucker's poke.<br> - No kidding!<br> - Come on. Dish it out. Time's a-wasting.<br> - What's the matter, crabbing already?<br> - Give me air! Give me air!<br> - How much you got there, Soapy?<br> - Let me see. Ten, 20, 30, 35...<br> - Gee!

Can't get anyplace.<br> You talk for 10 minutes, they'd<br> jump through a hoop if you asked.<br> Maybe it's because<br> I wear my collar frontwards.<br> As long as you're sponsoring the gym,<br> let's go and take a look at it.<br> - You mean now?<br> - Sure. Come on, I want to show you.<br> - You remember old Krausmeyer's store.<br> - Yeah, sure.

Right here.<br> Ready?<br> Run! Run!<br> - Free throw!<br> - That's not fair. He didn't do nothing.<br> That's it.<br> - Come on! Take it down!<br> - I got my man!<br> You do that again,<br> you're out of the game.<br> - I didn't do nothing. He's screwy.<br> - Give us a break.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Can't even shove a guy in this game?<br> What do you mean, shove a guy?<br> It's a free throw. Gibby, take it.<br> That's not fair!<br> - Hey, dribble that ball and pass it.<br> - Dribble that.<br> Foul!<br> That big bozo just stuck his belly out.<br> You boys know better than that.

Let's go!<br> - Break it up!<br> Foul!<br> All right!<br> Come on! Sullivan,<br> what are you doing?<br> Foul!<br> Foul ball!<br> - Wait for the whistle, you understand?<br> - Let's go.<br> - What's the idea?<br> - He didn't do nothing.<br> What's the idea?<br> I'm asking you.

Right there.<br> Put them in there.<br> - Somebody stole it.<br> - They played rough.<br> Where's my nickel?<br> - Who put those slugs in there?<br> - Not me.<br> - Kid, come on.<br> - Think I'd gyp you?<br> Rocky, you give us some practice tomorrow,<br> and we'll mop up these mugs.<br> I don't know nothing about that.<br> Better ask Father.<br> - Will you give us another chance tomorrow?<br> - Father! Come on!<br> - Give us some practice.<br> - Be a sport.<br> Well, I'll tell you...<br> ...promise no fouls. Meet me here,<br> and I'll try to arrange a game.<br> - Can you get smaller kids?<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, boy!<br> - You didn't know it was there, did you?<br> - No.<br> Just in time. Thanks.<br> Say...<br> ...you going home?<br> - Yes.<br> I'll wait for you.<br> Hey, Rock...<br> ...you wanna watch out. She's a jinx.<br> She put her last guy 6 foot under.<br> Anybody ask you?<br> I didn't say a word.<br> - Who's carrying your books for you now?<br> - Nobody.<br> I heard somewhere about you being<br> mixed up with a guy. Who was that?<br> There was only one: My husband.<br> - Took care of him?<br> - Yeah, about four years ago.<br> What happened?<br> What usually happens when a boy<br> gets mixed up...<br> ...with a bunch of would-be<br> tough guys.<br> He was a swell kid<br> when we first got married.<br> But he tried to give me a lot more<br> than he could get driving a cab.<br> Partly my fault. I didn't stop him.<br> Well, he got in deeper and deeper.<br> One night, he tried to shoot it out<br> with the cops.<br> That's what always happens, isn't it?<br> Maybe with guys who don't know<br> their business.<br> Hey, look, I think I got something<br> in my eye. Can you see anything?<br> - No.<br> - Got a handkerchief?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> No, no. It's all right.<br> What's the difference?<br> I've seen everything.<br> You know, you were right the other day.<br> This neighborhood don't change much.<br> Know that?<br> There's too much traffic.<br> We gotta wait for a better opening.<br> Now, trail him slow.

See?<br> - All right. All right. I was just asking.<br> How'd you get away with it?<br> You should've seen them cops pass me<br> on the stairs. They don't know nothing.<br> And me with this in me shirt.<br> You're all wrong, boys.<br> There was no snatch.<br> - We was on a business trip, that's all.<br> - Come on, Rocky.

Where?<br> - Murphy's poolroom.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah, Soapy and the gang.<br> Passing out beer to the neighborhood<br> kids. Throwing dollar bills like confetti.<br> - Wonder where they got the money.<br> - Well, you might ask them.<br> - Well, I'm gonna be going, Rocky.<br> - So soon?<br> - Coming, Laury?<br> - No, Father.<br> I want to stay and talk to Rocky<br> for a while.<br> When will I see you, Rocky?<br> - I'll catch up with you.<br> - Okay.<br> Bye.<br> - Well, Rocky, I guess...<br> - Wait a minute.<br> You're the kind of gal that's smart enough<br> to mind her own business.<br> - Am I right or wrong?<br> - Don't worry.<br> I know all the rules.<br> Get your one here. Five. Get your 10 here.<br> All bets covered! Come on, put it in.<br> Where'd you get the dough, Pasty?<br> We wrote to Santa Claus, see.<br> Then when we woke up this morning,<br> there it was in our socks.<br> All bets covered. Come on, boys.<br> - Give me another one.<br> - What do you mean? All I bet was 5 bucks!<br> - You trying to gyp the kid or something?<br> - He owes me 5 bucks.<br> Shut up!<br> - Dirty tables aggravate me.<br> - You're gonna make this shot, you know.<br> - Put your eight ball on the corner.<br> - Okay.<br> - All right.<br> - Hey, bury that beef, will you?<br> Pull in your head and get that off the table!<br> Got a three ball off the corner.<br> Nice shot, boy!<br> Eight bucks!<br> Eight bucks! My mother has to work almost<br> all week to make this much.<br> Give, give, give.<br> All right. All right.<br> All gamblers die broke.<br> Hey, Soapy, you promised us another round<br> of beers if you won.<br> Okay, go on, bring up another case.<br> What's the difference?<br> Those chumps are paying for it.<br> - What is this, a raid?<br> - No.<br> Maybe they're gonna make<br> a Sunday school out of it.<br> - Come on. I'll take two.<br> - I got that covered.<br> - Give me two.<br> - I got it covered.<br> Weren't you boys going over<br> to start that game?<br> Sure, Father, we just wanted to see<br> what was going on in here.<br> Come on, Joe. Come on, kids.<br> Let's go to the gym.<br> Giving a party, Soapy?<br> Everybody invited?<br> Yeah.<br> Why don't you give it at the gym.<br> Because we're having it here.<br> What about that game you asked for?<br> Hey, Small Change...<br> ...double that bet on that shot, okay?<br> - Okay. It's your murder.<br> Where did you get this money<br> you've been spending?<br> Hasn't anything I've told you for the last<br> three years meant anything?<br> You think that spending<br> this kind of money...<br> ...with a lot of hoodlums is gonna get you<br> anyplace but jail?<br> Come on, fellas, what do you say?<br> Why not go with me, and we'll figure<br> this whole thing out.<br> Come on. Let's go over to the gym.<br> - How about it, Swing?<br> - I don't know, Father.<br> I got a sore leg.<br> What do you say, Bim?<br> Father, there ain't no future<br> in playing basketball.<br> - Well, how about you fellas?<br> - Can't a guy even have any fun?<br> It's a waste of time.<br> Look, Father...<br> ...we don't fall for that pie-in-the-sky<br> stuff no more, see.<br> What's wrong? Can't you get them<br> to go to heaven with you?<br> You got the wrong slant, honey.<br> You got a bad break a long time ago...<br> ...and you're still figuring<br> that's the only way.<br> You're reading stuff about<br> "crime don't pay."<br> Don't be a sucker. That's for smalltimers<br> on shoestrings. Not people like us.<br> You belong in the bigshot class.<br> Both of us do.<br> - I wonder.<br> - Look...<br> Got any glad rags, something fancy,<br> an evening gown?<br> - A very old one.<br> - Well, come on, get it on.<br> - We'll go out and celebrate.<br> - What will we be celebrating?<br> All this! You don't get on<br> the front pages every day.<br> You don't get away<br> from the cops every day.<br> You do if you're smart. Come here.<br> See those white lights up there?<br> That's where you belong,<br> and that's where you're going.<br> Come on, I'll show you who<br> this town's made for.<br> Well, I hope that old gown of mine<br> hangs together.<br> - Wants an eight.<br> - Wants an eight.<br> - Here's 10,000 on red.<br> - You got a bet!<br> Thirty-six, red.<br> - Place your bets.<br> - Give the lady a stack of black chips.<br> - For whom?<br> - For me.<br> - Rocky Sullivan.<br> - Oh, yes. Sure, of course.<br> Try your luck. I got some business.<br> I'll be back in a while.<br> - But, Rocky, I'm not lucky.<br> - Don't be afraid. Let your hair down.<br> - Have some fun. Go ahead.<br> - Place your bets.<br> - How much are these?<br> - Fifty dollars.<br> - Change them to dollar chips.<br> - But he wants black.<br> - I don't like black.<br> - Oh, you don't like black.<br> After I knew the facts, and seeing how<br> Jim owed you the dough...<br> ...and it being a misunderstanding,<br> we'll call it square, with no hard feelings...<br> ...especially now that you're<br> in the know of things.<br> - You boys really want to talk business?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on, let's talk.<br> Look here, Rocky, what about<br> those accounts you took from my safe?<br> Those are very good insurance,<br> just in case you boys change your minds.<br> - Okay. What do you want, Rocky?<br> - Nothing from you, Mac.<br> Just my original agreement with Frazier:<br> That sounds fair enough, Jim.<br> All right. It's a deal.<br> Now, look, I'm gonna take very good care<br> of those accounts.<br> If I was you, I wouldn't do anything<br> I'd be sorry for...<br> ...because I'm gonna pay special attention<br> to those books, understand?<br> A deal between you guys is a deal,<br> just like it was on paper.<br> - That's me, Rocky. I do everything legal.<br> - Oh, yeah. I know that.<br> If you don't mind, partners, my accountant<br> will go over the books...<br> ...just to make sure you boys ain't cheating.<br> Fair enough?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Okay.<br> How long do you think I'll let that guy<br> sit in my chair?<br> Just as long as he hangs on<br> to that information.<br> - You like this place?<br> - Sure. Why wouldn't I?<br> - Just got a piece of it.<br> - Rocky.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Maybe you are smart enough.<br> How'd you like to give up that<br> two-for-nickel job and move in here?<br> Doing what?<br> Just sitting, looking pretty, dance a little,<br> play a little. Kind of a hostess.<br> Give you 100 a week and expenses.<br> And it'll be very nice to have<br> at least one friend in this place.<br> Come in.<br> Yes, Mrs. McGee, what is it?<br> Well, I've had lunch waiting since noon,<br> then this package came by messenger.<br> I thought maybe it was important,<br> so I brought it up.<br> All right. Thank you.<br> Is there anything wrong, Father?<br> No, no, nothing.<br> Oh, I won't have any lunch.<br> If I'd known that this morning,<br> I could've saved some money.<br> You wait. I'll tell him you're here.<br> Make yourself at home.<br> Thanks.<br> Hi, Jerry. What do you hear?<br> What do you say? Trying your luck?<br> Yes, I'd like to,<br> but I haven't got any money.<br> Except this, and it's not mine.<br> - Say, where did you get ahold of that?<br> - Where did you?<br> Here, Rocky. Thanks, but I can't accept it.<br> What's the matter? You silly?<br> That ain't mine.<br> I know it isn't. That's why I can't take it.<br> What is this?<br> You flash this wad on me, then try to tell<br> me the dough is mine. What's it all about?<br> You've got a great poker face, Rocky.<br> But don't forget, I've known that face<br> for a long time.<br> I know you forced Frazier to get you<br> $ 100,000. Everybody knows it.<br> What's the difference<br> where the dough came from?<br> First place, Frazier owed it to me.<br> It's mine.<br> Second, it's a lot better you get<br> a chunk of it than him.<br> And suppose the dough is hot?<br> Nobody knows that but you and me.<br> That's just it.<br> Oh, come on. Don't be such an angel.<br> You want to get the center built?<br> Go get it started!<br> I don't want to build it<br> on rotten foundations.<br> Oh, don't be a sucker!<br> All right, Rocky.<br> Supposing I take the money.<br> And I kid myself it's a means to an end.<br> Well, it isn't. Never will be.<br> Inside the center, my boys will be clean,<br> and outside...<br> ...they'd be surrounded by the same<br> rotten corruption and crime and criminals.<br> Yes, yourself included.<br> Criminals on all sides for my boys<br> to look up to and revere...<br> ...and respect and admire and imitate.<br> What good is it to teach<br> that honesty is the best policy...<br> ...when all around, they see<br> that dishonesty is a better policy?<br> The hoodlum and gangster is looked up to<br> with the same respect...<br> ...as the successful businessman<br> or popular hero.<br> You, and the Fraziers<br> and the Keefers...<br> ...and the rest of those rotten politicians<br> you've got in the palm of your hand.<br> Yes, and you've got my boys too.<br> Whatever I teach them,<br> you show me up.<br> You show them the easiest way.<br> The quickest way<br> is with a racket or a gun.<br> Well, it's so, ain't it?<br> Yes, it's so. God help us.<br> You see, Rocky...<br> ...I thought I could solve<br> my problems and...<br> Problems with my boys,<br> which, after all, they are...<br> ...from the bottom up.<br> But I can't do it.<br> - I've got to start from the top down.<br> - Yeah? How?<br> I'll tell you how.<br> I'm gonna use your kidnapping Frazier<br> as a crowbar...<br> ...to pry open and uncover<br> this cesspool.<br> I'm gonna force the law,<br> corrupt or not...<br> ...to bring to the light of day<br> this filthy affair.<br> Now, there's gonna be a lot of people<br> stepped on, Rocky...<br> ...and if you happen to get in the way...<br> ...l'll be sorry, but you'll be stepped on<br> just as hard.<br> All right, Jerry, go to it. But you've got<br> as much chance of getting an indictment...<br> ...as I have of getting into<br> Bible Society.<br> You'll find nobody cares.<br> You'll find them laughing at you.<br> End up a lot of blind alleys.<br> But go ahead, kid.<br> And if I'm in your way, why,<br> keep on stepping just as hard.<br> For being honest<br> and for old times' sake.<br> Rocky, there's one favor I'm gonna<br> have to ask you.<br> Maybe I won't be able to return it.<br> Well, go ahead. Anything you say.<br> Soapy and those kids,<br> give them a break, will you?<br> Don't offer them any more money.<br> Don't encourage them to...<br> To admire you.<br> All right. I'll do that.<br> Sure, you will.<br> Father Connolly, I'd like to help you.<br> I really would.<br> But we can't get away with it.<br> The organization is too powerful to fight.<br> You know what you're asking of me?<br> Yes, Mr. White.<br> The other papers have gone to great lengths<br> to explain the risks to me.<br> You'll go into the fight personally?<br> Devote your full time to it?<br> Believe me when I say,<br> nothing would please me any more.<br> Very well, Father Connolly, I'm with you.<br> The press will back you to the limit.<br> Thank you, and I appreciate it.<br> Get me the inside<br> on Frazier and Keefer's bank accounts.<br> I don't care where you get the dope<br> but get it.<br> Pap, get me all the information you can<br> on Frazier before he got to town.<br> If he'd ever been mixed up with Sullivan.<br> The lid is off on expenses.<br> Jenkins, go back through the police files<br> and find out...<br> ...how many of Keefer's men<br> have been sprung since Frazier moved in.<br> Why are you hounding Rocky?<br> Why are you trying to send him<br> to prison for life?<br> You can't do that to Rocky.<br> I won't let you.<br> It's not his fault, Father.<br> He was just a kid who made a mistake<br> and got sent to reform school.<br> They made a criminal out of him.<br> But he's not bad, not really bad.<br> You know that.<br> And whatever they've done to him,<br> no matter what he is now...<br> ...no matter whether he's right or wrong...<br> ...we both love him, Father.<br> Yes, Laury, we both love him.<br> I've loved him since we were kids,<br> We worked together, fought together.<br> Stole together.<br> Oh, I'm not blaming Rocky<br> for what he is today.<br> But for the grace of God,<br> there walk I.<br> I'd do anything for him, Laury...<br> ...anything in the world to help him.<br> I'd give my life if I thought<br> it would do any good...<br> ...but it wouldn't.<br> You see, Laury,<br> there's all those other kids...<br> ...hundreds of them, in the streets<br> and bad environment...<br> ...whom I don't want to see<br> grow up like Rocky did.<br> I can't sacrifice them for Rocky.<br> You see, Laury, they have lives too.<br> I can't throw them away.<br> I can't.<br> And the very fact that countless thousands<br> of you are listening in tonight...<br> ... is proof to fling in the teeth<br> of these cynics and skeptics...<br> ... that the public does care<br> and does propose to do something...<br> ... about the appalling conditions<br> I have tried to describe tonight.<br> And do not doubt that our efforts so far<br> have not struck fear and panic...<br> ... into the cesspool of official<br> and near-official corruption.<br> Yeah, I'm shaking like a leaf.<br> "This very afternoon, I was approached<br> with a sugarcoated proposition...<br> ...a bribe offered me<br> by this corrupt officialdom.<br> $ 100,000 for the building and equipment<br> of a recreation center in my parish...<br> ...if I would agree to refrain<br> from further attacks...<br> ... if I would sabotage this campaign...<br> ... if I would shut my eyes, stop my ears<br> and hold my tongue.<br> But the building of an isolated playground<br> to shield my boys from crime...<br> ...is not rooting out the crime itself.<br> We must rid ourselves<br> of the criminal parasites that feed on us.<br> We must wipe out those<br> we have ignorantly elected...<br> ... and those who manipulate this<br> diseased officialdom behind locked doors.<br> Tonight, we have in our power<br> to ask definitely...<br> ... incriminating questions<br> of these officials.<br> And the power to demand<br> satisfactory answers.<br> What really is the truth in the case of<br> the racketeer and gunman Rocky Sullivan?<br> Why did the police release him so suddenly<br> with all the evidence they had against him?<br> Why did the notorious Mac Keefer<br> pay Sullivan $ 100,000 in cash...<br> ... and what political sword does he hold<br> over the trembling hands...<br> ... of district attorneys, judges<br> and police officials?<br> But tomorrow, the new grand jury will meet,<br> and these questions must be answered.<br> Therefore, I ask all of you<br> who are listening in..."<br> And you thought you could<br> buy him off?<br> - I told you you were wasting your time.<br> - We ain't wasting any more time.<br> That was that guy's last chance.<br> We're gonna take care of him tonight.<br> You're talking through your hat.<br> You can't bump off a priest.<br> Forget it.<br> I'll forget it. Tomorrow morning,<br> when he's floating down the river.<br> Now, get this straight, Sullivan.<br> Even if he is an old pal of yours,<br> I'm still running the works.<br> I'm not taking orders from you<br> all of a sudden.<br> He's not gonna appear<br> at no grand jury tomorrow.<br> Shooting off his mouth...<br> I say he gets it tonight.<br> - Not if I'm around.<br> - Now, wait a minute, gentlemen.<br> There's no sense in running<br> too far ahead of ourselves.<br> Don't forget, there are all kinds<br> of grand juries...<br> ...and there's all kinds of ways<br> of handling them.<br> That's what you got me for.<br> - Lf you can do a thing legally, why take a...?<br> - Sure, only I want action.<br> I don't care how we stop that guy,<br> I only want him stopped.<br> All right, then leave it to me.<br> You know, Rocky...<br> ...this is no penny-ante reform wave<br> this priest is starting.<br> This is a tidal wave,<br> and unless we stop it quick...<br> ...we're gonna find ourselves in the pen.<br> Look, Frazier, nobody knows better than me<br> that we're in a spot. I know that.<br> And, Mac, as far as I'm concerned,<br> you can settle it any way you like.<br> But lay off the rough stuff, you see?<br> That's out.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Don't worry, Mac. I've got an idea<br> how we can stymie that grand jury.<br> That preacher won't get to first base.<br> I hope you were stalling.<br> I meant what I said.<br> This is the way I figure it.<br> - Connolly is Rocky's pal, and he's a priest.<br> - So what?<br> Where would be the logical place<br> for Rocky to keep those accounts?<br> With a priest, to make them public<br> if anything happens to Rocky.<br> That ain't news to me.<br> I knew that.<br> - That's why he can be a wise guy.<br> - All right.<br> If we're gonna get that preacher tonight,<br> why not get those accounts too?<br> Yeah.<br> Only this time, no drugstore mistakes.<br> I'm taking care of this job myself.<br> Get Blackie up here right away.<br> Now listen, Mac. I don't care how<br> you handle Sullivan.<br> It's got to look like an accident<br> with the priest.<br> Leave that to me.<br> Rocky! Don't! Don't!<br> - I'll do anything.<br> - Oh, no, you won't.<br> You've had your last chance.<br> Take this with you.<br> I never let go of those papers.<br> All you had to do was bump me off.<br> - It's locked.<br> - Come on, stand back. Shoot it off.<br> Gunfight at the El Toro.<br> Is Father Connolly still there?<br> I must talk to him. It's urgent.<br> - Well?<br> - Rocky Sullivan, captain.<br> He got Frazier and Keefer. They've chased<br> him up on the roof of the El Toro.<br> MacMahon, throw a cordon<br> around the block.<br> Come on, you men, with me.<br> Here's the microphone, captain.<br> O'Flannigan, hook up those searchlights<br> and play them on the building.<br> Galavan, cover the warehouse skylights.<br> There he is!<br> Sullivan, are you coming out,<br> or must we smoke you out?<br> All right, give him the tear gas.<br> Please.<br> Captain.<br> I'm Father Connolly,<br> an old friend of Rocky's.<br> He'll come out for me.<br> He'll listen to me.<br> This is a job for the police, Father.<br> He'll need a priest later.<br> - You wanna kill him, or you want him alive?<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> He'll listen to me, I'm sure.<br> Won't you let me talk to him?<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Thank you.<br> Rocky! Rocky, this is Jerry.<br> Please come out.<br> Tell him we'll get him, if we have to<br> blow up the whole block.<br> Rocky, you've got to come out!<br> I'm coming up.<br> Officers, hold your fire.<br> Rocky?<br> - Rocky.<br> - What are you doing up here? Beat it!<br> I'm coming in, Rocky.<br> You wanna get your skull full of lead?<br> Get out of here!<br> You're smarter than to stick your kisser<br> in this place.<br> I couldn't watch them shoot you down,<br> Rocky.<br> They've got you covered from every angle.<br> Your only chance is to give yourself up.<br> You're through, Rocky. You're finished.<br> Yeah, I was until you stepped into it.<br> Father Connolly, are you all right?<br> Go on.<br> Get over there and tell them<br> to call off their dogs.<br> I'm going down with you.<br> Sure, you are.<br> Call off your men, all of them!<br> Sullivan's coming out with me.<br> Hold your fire, men, but stand by.<br> Let's go.<br> Come on, get them up, Jerry.<br> Sorry it has to be you, kid,<br> but get going.<br> Get away, or I'll let him have it!<br> Get away!<br> Back around.<br> Come on.<br> Get them up high. High!<br> Get back, all of you.<br> I'll give it to him right in the head!<br> Back!<br> Duck, Jerry!<br> Got him in the leg.<br> Empty.<br> So is your thick skull, copper.<br> Extra! Identify killer!<br> Papers! Get your papers! Extra!<br> Extra! Get your papers!<br> Identify killer!<br> Gee, that's tough.<br> Boy, I'd like to get my hands<br> on those squealers.<br> "Special prosecutor for trial of Rocky today.<br> State builds strong case."<br> That dope of a governor's so scared<br> of Rocky, he's appointing a special shyster.<br> "Rocky guilty. To die."<br> Gee, you think they'll burn him<br> in the chair?<br> No, they can't build no death house<br> that'll hold Rocky.<br> - You mean he'll blow it?<br> - Just wait, that's all. Just wait.<br> He'll show those mugs how to die<br> in a big way.<br> Sure, he will. They'll never make him crack.<br> - There's nothing yellow about Rocky.<br> - You bet.<br> Remember what he said at the trial?<br> He said he'd spit in their eye.<br> He'll do it too. He'll laugh at them.<br> Sure. Sure, he'll show those phonies up.<br> Sullivan.<br> Rocky, Father Connolly has received<br> permission to be with you.<br> He just arrived. You'll see him, won't you?<br> Yeah, sure, send him in.<br> But tell him none of that incense<br> and holy-water stuff, will you?<br> Whatever you say, Rocky.<br> Did you enjoy your dinner, Mr. Sullivan?<br> Yeah, it was good,<br> only the meat was burnt.<br> And I don't like burnt meat,<br> do you?<br> Listen, big shot, you got only<br> Don't try stalling around<br> with that priest pal of yours.<br> Ten minutes till that hot seat.<br> I'm gonna tell the electrician<br> to give it to you slow and easy, wise guy.<br> Somebody get him out of here,<br> will you!<br> - Come on! Take him out of there!<br> - Get him out of there!<br> Let him alone, Herbert.<br> Quiet.<br> Quiet, now! Quiet.<br> - How are you?<br> - How much time?<br> About 10 minutes.<br> Hi, Jerry. What do you hear?<br> What do you say?<br> - Hello, Rocky. How do you feel?<br> - Like a million.<br> - How's Soapy and the kids?<br> - Pulling for you all the way...<br> ...as long as there's<br> the slightest hope from the governor.<br> - They'll be easier to handle without me.<br> - That's up to you, Rocky.<br> We haven't got a lot of time.<br> I want to ask one last favor.<br> - There's not much left that I can do, kid.<br> - Yes, there is, Rocky.<br> Perhaps more than you could do<br> under any other circumstances.<br> If you have the courage for it,<br> and I know you have.<br> Walking in there?<br> That's not gonna take much.<br> - I know that, Rocky.<br> - It's like a barber chair.<br> They're gonna ask, "Anything to say?"<br> I'll say, "Sure, give me a haircut, a shave<br> and one of those new electric massages."<br> - But you're not afraid, Rocky?<br> - No. They'd like me to be.<br> But I'm afraid I can't oblige them, kid.<br> You know, Jerry, I think to be afraid,<br> you gotta have a heart.<br> I don't think I got one.<br> I had that cut out of me a long time ago.<br> Suppose I asked you to have the heart, huh?<br> - To be scared.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Suppose the guards dragged you out of here<br> screaming for mercy.<br> - Suppose you went to the chair yellow.<br> - Yellow?<br> Say, what's the matter with you?<br> You've been worrying about my courage.<br> I know that.<br> This is a different kind of courage,<br> Rocky.<br> The kind that's...<br> Well, it's born in heaven.<br> Not the courage of heroics and bravado.<br> The kind that you and I<br> and God know about.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> Look, Rocky, just before I came up here,<br> the boys saw me off on the train.<br> Soapy and several of the others.<br> You can well imagine what they told me.<br> "Father, tell Rocky to show the world<br> what he's made of.<br> Tell him not to be afraid...<br> ...and to go out laughing..."<br> - Well, what do you want?<br> I'm not gonna let them down.<br> That's what I want you to do.<br> I want you to let them down.<br> See, you've been a hero to these kids and<br> hundreds of others, all through your life.<br> Now you're gonna be a glorified hero<br> in death, and I want to prevent that, Rocky.<br> They've gotta despise your memory.<br> They've got to be ashamed of you.<br> You're asking me to pull an act, turn yellow<br> so those kids will think I'm no-good?<br> You're asking me to throw away the only<br> thing I got left that they can't take away.<br> To give those newspapers a chance to say,<br> "Another rat turned yellow."<br> You and I will know you're not.<br> You ask a nice little favor, Jerry.<br> Asking me to crawl on my belly<br> the last thing I do.<br> I know what I'm asking.<br> The reason I'm asking is because<br> being kids together gave me the idea...<br> ...that you might like to<br> join hands with me...<br> ...and save some of those other boys<br> from ending up here.<br> You're asking too much.<br> You wanna help those kids...<br> ...figure out some other way.<br> - It's impossible to do it without your help.<br> I can't reach all of those boys.<br> Thousands of hero-worshiping kids<br> all over the country.<br> Don't give me that humanity stuff again.<br> I had enough in the courtroom.<br> Told everything.
