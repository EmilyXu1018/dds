Are you out of your mind?<br> Nothing, it's doesn't matter.<br> Forget about it...<br> ...don't get angry.<br> It's just, when you work all day long<br> with a guy...<br> ...sometimes you're imagining things.<br> Well, it's not my style.<br> A bit awkward, uh?<br> Still, I find you funny.<br> VYou must be quite a catch,<br> but you're not aware of it.<br> You have nerve!<br> Oh, you didn't understand!<br> I didn't try to position myself.<br> Do you have someone?<br> Right!<br> Is she pretty?<br> They're very pretty.<br> Oh my, what a bastard!<br> Okay, so long chick!<br> If this is love, why bother?<br> I'd rather never, never.<br> I'd rather never love.<br> One day it's me.<br> The day after, it's someone else.<br> So why, why me...<br> ...rather than someone else?<br> If this is love, why bother?<br> Change always, all the time...<br> ...I'd rather forget about love.<br> Is there something else about sensual life<br> Than a alternative motion...<br> ...between apetite and disgust,<br> and between disgust and apetite...<br> ...between apetite and disgust,<br> and between disgust and apetite.<br> I don't care!<br> Shut up, Let me talk.<br> The floating mind, always unsecure,<br> between ardour who revels itself...<br> ...ardour who renew itself and<br> then slow down...<br> ...ardour who renew itself and<br> then slow down.<br> Gimme a break!<br> But amidst this perpetual motion<br> ...between apetite and disgust,<br> and between disgust and apetite...<br> ...we fool ourselves by the concept<br> of stray...<br> ...freedom. Do you who i'm quoting?<br> - No.<br> Bossuet.<br> Bravo!<br> The Funeral Orations?<br> Oh no!<br> Because I'm cynical enough<br> to make it my course of action.<br> Ah you're disgusting!<br> Disgusting, man.<br> Sure. A little bit of amnesia<br> and look where it's getting you.<br> A violent poison,<br> this is what love is.<br> Something to take carefully.<br> Like in car.<br> Actually it's 190.<br> Bloodshed.<br> Here's a piece of advice,<br> if you care about your life...<br> ...forget it!<br> I'm running after a shadow.<br> And it's not even mine.<br> She'd be on the theater's bill.<br> I could wait for her in front of<br> the stage door.<br> But she's unreachable.<br> Where could I possibly find her?<br> Ah, my little Amstrong Jones,<br> you shouldn't have shot pictures!<br> Oh you're so sickening.<br> There's no way to talk with you.<br> Everythin's a joke for you!<br> Wrong.<br> Terribly wrong.<br> One of these days, you'll see,<br> and you'll get me.<br> Listen.<br> When you'll be fed up...<br> ...I have a chick for you...<br> ...absolutely stupid...<br> ...but so aesthetically pleasing.<br> Okay, don't bother.<br> Bye!<br> With her everything would be possible.<br> Will she even recognize me?<br> Between dream and reality,<br> there's a gap.<br> Yeah, everything's possible.<br> She can find me unbearable.<br> With a girl you know from a picture,<br> you never know.<br> With her everything would be possible.<br> It will be wonderful for me at first.<br> We'll see lesser of each other,<br> if I don't tell him.<br> But then, it will hurt<br> more and more.<br> With him everything would be possible...<br> ...it's never good the first time though.<br> It would surely be not that bad,<br> and then it would get better.<br> And then it would ge worse.<br> What if she finds me unbearable?<br> It would surprise me though.<br> I'd be in sorrow, each day more.<br> As she wouldn't mind my love.<br> With him, it's impossible.<br> Splitting up would be awful the first time.<br> I'd be in sorrow, each day less...<br> ...until I just wouldn't mind.<br> I just need to see her to know.<br> He just need to see me to have me.<br> Hey, it's you?<br> Well I don't know, I guess so.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Same as you, I'm trying to cross the street.<br> This way then.<br> I know, I know, you're the illustrator<br> from the lane 4...<br> ...room 3, table 42.<br> The one who's biting her pencils!<br> First of all, I'm not a illustrator,<br> I'm a colorist.<br> That's what I said.<br> You color drawings & advertisments.<br> Not at all. From monday to thursday,<br> I use blue.<br> From thursday to saturday,<br> I can use red.<br> If I'm not making too much mistakes...<br> ...next year, maybe I'll have the right to<br> use orange,<br> but somone has to pull strings for me.<br> Say, you're still running after<br> your caricature?<br> Why a caricature?<br> You don't even know her.<br> Neither do you.<br> True. I don't know her.<br> Nevertheless, I'm addicted to her.<br> And it's gonna get worse if I meet her!<br> I think...<br> ...it's a good thing to be separated from<br> someone before you get to know that person.<br> It means less pain.<br> Will you end up kill yourself for her?<br> I don't really know.<br> I haven't made up any plan yet.<br> For the moment, I'm nuts and<br> that's a full-time job.<br> You're nuts?<br> That's great!<br> I'm not and it's getting boring.<br> Farewell.<br> Goodbye.<br> So be it.<br> I don't know this place,<br> I've never been there.<br> That's the first symptom, so I've been told.<br> A percussive jam-session.<br> She's behind my eyelids,<br> upside down.<br> I won't say "you", I say "she".<br> She must at least know that I love her!<br> Stupid bitch!<br> I know what's wrong with me:<br> dlirium.<br> I chase you away from my mind...<br> ...I reject you...<br> ...I avoid you, but you come back to me...<br> ...always, you come back to me...<br> ...like a boomerang.<br> It'd be so nice if you could hit me<br> lethally...<br> ...and end my life...<br> ...but no, tou keep coming back...<br> ...like a boomerang.<br> Me, myself and I think that I'm cured...<br> ...my heart no longer beats.<br> I stay until dawn...<br> ...between life and love.<br> Sometimes, I think I'm cured...<br> ...my heart no longer beats.<br> I stay until dawn...<br> ...between life and love.<br> Have mercy on the fool I am...<br> ...Finish me off for good.<br> Go away, yeah, go away...<br> ...don't ever come back like a boomerang.<br> That's the 13th bar I'm in tonight.<br> But I'll find her...<br> ...I'll find her.<br> Y'know...<br> ...looking for a girl in the bars, it makes you<br> kind a thirsty.<br> What time is it?<br> In six secondes, it'll be 4:00 AM.<br> Hey, don't make fun of me!<br> Sorry, Sir.<br> I'm gonna break up.<br> It will be quiet, no shouting, no crying.<br> I'll remain cold, icy, english-style.<br> She'll clutch to me...<br> ...She'll cry, she'll weep,<br> but I won't even look at her, oh no.<br> Because I, I'm more worthy than her.<br> She must be a foreigner.<br> How could you know since you don't even<br> know her?<br> The eyes...<br> ...like circumflex accents.<br> Oh, c'mon. The hallucination trick,<br> I'm not buying it!<br> Do you think I'm some sort of dumb-ass?<br> Do you?<br> She exaggerates,<br> she thinks I'm a dumb-ass.<br> Yes, Sir!<br> It ain't right! It ain't right!<br> Stay still,<br> only way here to move.<br> Or else I'll crumble!<br> I'm killing myself!<br> Look what she has done to me!<br> See what's left?<br> Thank you! Thank you so much!<br> What is she doing for god's sake!<br> She's here, she's not here.<br> It's not possible, not possible!<br> Not possible.<br> And yet, as I'm closing my eyes, she's here.<br> Don't say anything, no need to.<br> Don't say anything, follow me.<br> Ne dis rien. N'aie pas peur...<br> ...ne crains rien de moi.<br> Suis-moi jusqu'au bout de la nuit...<br> ...jusqu'au bout de ma folie.<br> Laisse le temps...<br> oublie demain...<br> oublie tout,<br> ne pense plus rien.<br> Don't say anything, no need to.<br> Don't say anything, follow me.<br> Don't say anything, don't be afraid...<br> ...have no fear.<br> Follow me till the bottom of the night...<br> ...till the bottom of my madness.<br> Let time be...<br> forget about tomorrow...<br> forget everything, don't think about<br> anything.<br> Follow me till the bottom of the night...<br> ...till the bottom of my madness.<br> Let time be...<br> forget about tomorrow...<br> forget everything, don't think about<br> anything.<br> Did he take his pink pills?<br> Pistolet Joe sleeps with one eye open...<br> the other one is always open.<br> Pistolet Joe sleeps with one eye open...<br> ...the other one is made out of glass.<br> Pistolet Joe.<br> Oh... Pistolet Joe.<br> Pistolet Joe was striking me...<br> but one day he was betraying me.<br> Pistolet Joe, it serves you right...<br> the bullet that blinded you half.<br> G.I. Joe, you're gonna die<br> under stars & stripes.<br> G.I. Joe, all the rockets will get your<br> american ass.<br> How many stars on this flag?<br> One, two, three, four,<br> five, six, seven, eight.<br> How many stars on this hero?<br> Seven, six, five, four,<br> three, two, one, zero!<br> It's my fault, I've loved her,<br> I'm the one who killed her!<br> G.I. Joe, Wonder-Woman for<br> the american hero.<br> G.I. Joe, you're gonna die<br> under stars & stripes.<br> How many stars on this flag?<br> One, two, three, four,<br> five, six, seven, eight.<br> How many stars on this hero?<br> Seven, six, five, four,<br> three, two, one, zero!<br> How was it already?<br> That's the tune I've loved so much.<br> A precise point under the tropic.<br> All this stuff looks so far...<br> ...so far...<br> ...so far, so far, so far...<br> Unreachable.<br> A vanishing point.<br> On the seashore.<br> Laying down on the sand...<br> ...under the sun, precisely under the sun.<br> I must have gone crazy...<br> ...It was merely a dream.<br> - Look at that cutie, look!<br> - Yeah, she's not bad!<br> Ah, so here's the awaited picture for<br> the end of the year.<br> Look at your face on this one!<br> Wow, look at you, you look nice there.<br> - Hey, wait a moment. Who's that?<br> - Look. It's me.<br> No, not you.<br> What?<br> Gimme a break!<br> What's the trouble?<br> Leave him be.<br> Say, Paul, where is she?<br> Who?<br> Her.<br> Answer me!<br> I don't know.<br> She can't to this to me, it's not possible.<br> Qhe can't leave me that way.<br> You could have told me it was you!<br> I was looking for you!<br> What's he doing now?<br> I must seek her, for sure.<br> I should have tried to tell him.<br> Maybe she tried to tell me something.<br> But I was insane, looking for the other.<br> For her, actually.<br> And I got it so wrong.<br> What a fool!<br> What a fool I've been!<br> She was so close to me.<br> I didn't manage to hold her up.<br> All I want is to tell him...<br> ..."I love you".<br> Thus, maybe...<br> ...who knows?<br>
