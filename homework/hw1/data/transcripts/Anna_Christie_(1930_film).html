Me?<br> Oh, no. Sure, kid. No, l...<br> I was thinking of something else.<br> Well, I wouldn't blame you, at that.<br> I guess I do look rotten.<br> I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.<br> I'm gonna have another drink.<br> What do you say?<br> Will you have something on me?<br> Sure thing. Thanks. Larry?<br> Larry!<br> Little service here, please.<br> - Same for me.<br> - Oh, same here.<br> Sit over here.

Well, I wanna<br> tell you straight, kiddo...<br> ...that Marthy Owens never...<br> Oh, let's cut out the scrapping.<br> I don't want no hard feelings<br> with no one.<br> - Come on, let's shake and be friends.<br> - Sure.<br> I ain't looking for trouble either.<br> Let's have another, huh?<br> Say, don't you think you'd better<br> go kind of easy on that stuff?<br> Well, I guess you're right.<br> I gotta meet someone too. My old man.<br> I ain't seen him since I was a kid.<br> Don't even know what he looks like.<br> I just got a letter now and then.<br> This was always the only address<br> he gave me to write him back.<br> He used to be a sailor. He's a janitor<br> of some building here.<br> - A janitor?<br> - Sure.<br> And I was thinking, seeing he ain't<br> done a thing for me in my life...<br> ...he might be willing to stake me with<br> a room and eats until I could rest up.<br> But I ain't expecting much from him.<br> Give you a kick when you're down,<br> that's what all men do.<br> And I don't suppose he'll turn out<br> no better than the rest.<br> Do you hang around this dump much?<br> Oh, off and on.<br> Why, maybe you know him, my old man.<br> Well, it... It isn't old Chris, is it?<br> - Who, old Chris?<br> - Yeah, Chris Christopherson.<br> - That's his full name.<br> - That's him.<br> Anna Christopherson is my real name...<br> ...only out there, I call myself<br> Anna Christie.<br> - So you know him, huh?<br> - Oh, I've seen him around here for years.<br> What kind is he?<br> Well, he's as fine an old guy<br> as ever walked on two feet...<br> ...and that goes.<br> Well, I'm glad to hear that.<br> Why, you think he'll stake me<br> to the rest cure I'm after, then?<br> Surest thing you know. Where'd you<br> get the idea that he was a janitor?<br> Well, he wrote me he was himself.<br> He's lying.<br> He's a captain on a barge.<br> A barge? What kind of a barge?<br> Well, coal, mostly.<br> A coal barge?<br> Well, well. If that ain't a swell job...<br> ...to find your long-lost old man<br> working at.<br> Oh, gee.<br> Well, that puts the kibosh<br> on his giving me a rest.<br> Why? Couldn't you live on it too?<br> Who, me? On a dirty coal barge?<br> Well, what do you think I am?<br> Well, what do you know about a barge?<br> Bet you ain't never seen a barge.<br> That's what comes of him bringing<br> you up inland where you'd be safe.<br> Say, his bringing me up,<br> is that what he tells people?<br> Well, I sure like his nerve.<br> Why, he let them cousins keep me on the<br> farm and work me to death like a dog.<br> Well, you didn't fall<br> for that farm life, did you?<br> I should say not.<br> I had to slave for all of them.<br> Was all right till my mother died...<br> ...but I was only a poor relation,<br> you know...<br> ...and they treated me worse<br> than they dared treat a hired girl.<br> Oh, what a life on that farm<br> out in Minnesota.<br> With them Swedes, woman-hungry.<br> One night I was alone in the house<br> and one of the sons came back.<br> After that, I hated them,<br> so I'd kill them all if I stayed...<br> ...so I ran away. St. Paul.<br> Yeah, I overheard Chris saying as how<br> you was in St. Paul.<br> - Working, he said.<br> - Oh, that's no lie.<br> I went there to work, but I was still a kid.<br> It's all men's fault,<br> giving you the wrong start.<br> I'm just out of the hospital two weeks.<br> The judge gave all of us girls 30 days.<br> Well, the others didn't seem to mind<br> being in the cooler much.<br> But I couldn't stand it. I went nuts.<br> I never could stand<br> being caged up nowhere.<br> I got good and sick, and they had<br> to send me to the hospital.<br> And it was nice there.<br> I was sorry to leave it, honest.<br> If my old man doesn't help me...<br> ...it's men again.<br> Men all the time.<br> Oh, how I hate them,<br> every mother's son of them.

I'm thinking<br> it is a poor weak thing you are.<br> Not a man at all.<br> You see if I'm man<br> maybe quicker than you think.<br> You know the truth in your heart. The sea<br> hit you a clout once and knocked you down.<br> You're not man enough to get up for<br> another, but you lie there howling murder.<br> I'd like to see you<br> in the best of your youth.<br> - Do what I done in the storm and after.<br> - Why, you young fool, you.<br> In old days,<br> when I was on windjammer...<br> ...I went through hundred storms<br> worse than that.<br> Ships were ships then,<br> and men what sailing them real men.<br> What you got on steamers now?<br> You got fellas on deck don't know<br> a ship from a mud scow...<br> ...and below deck, you got fellas<br> just know how to shovel coal.<br> You might as well<br> work on coal wagon ashore, you.<br> Is it throwing insults at the men<br> in the stokehold you are, you old ape?<br> One of them is worth any 10 squareheads<br> ever shipped on a windbag.<br> - You Irish swine.<br> - So you don't like the Irish, you old baboon?<br> Sure, it's that you're needing<br> in your family. An Irishman.<br> A man of the stokehold<br> to put guts in it...<br> ...so you'll not be rearing up grandchildren<br> to be jackasses like yourself.<br> Sure, old men getting childish<br> shouldn't play with knives.<br> Faith, I've half a mind to hit you a clout<br> will put sense in your square head.<br> Keep away from me, now.<br> Hello, Matt. Are you here already?<br> Say, what's up? How did that chair<br> get knocked over?<br> Oh, Matt, you haven't been fighting<br> with him, after you promised?<br> I've not laid a hand on him, Anna.<br> I told him to his teeth I love you.<br> That's God's truth, and well you know it.<br> He tell same thing<br> to girl in every port he goes.<br> I know it's true, Matt.<br> Don't you mind what he says.<br> God bless you.<br> And then I said I thought maybe<br> you'd have a bit of love for me too.<br> So you told him that?<br> Maybe I have. I've been wondering<br> if I do love you.<br> I didn't want to, I must own up to that.<br> But l... I guess I can't help it,<br> so I guess I do.<br> Oh, sure, I do, Matt. What's the use<br> of kidding myself different?<br> - Sure, I love you.<br> - God be praised.<br> And I haven't ever loved a man<br> in my life before, never.<br> Faith, we'll be having a grand, beautiful<br> life together to the end of our days.<br> Matt.<br> - Goodbye, Matt.<br> - Goodbye, is it?<br> I'll be coming at you in a second<br> for more of the same.<br> Own up like a man<br> when you're beat fair and square.<br> Here's me hand to you.<br> We'll be friends from this out.<br> No, I don't shake hands with you, fella.<br> Not while I live.<br> The back of me hand to you,<br> then, if that suits you.<br> It's a rotten bad loser you are,<br> devil mend you.<br> No, I don't lose.<br> Anna said she like you little bit.<br> But you don't hear her say<br> she marry you, I bet.<br> No, and I don't hear her say<br> the sun is shining, either.<br> - No, I didn't say it, Matt.<br> - There, you hear?<br> You're waiting to be asked, you mean?<br> Well, I'm asking you now.<br> We'll be wedded this day,<br> with the help of God.<br> - You heard what I said after I kissed you.<br> - I don't remember.<br> I said goodbye.<br> That kiss was for goodbye, Matt.<br> What do you mean?<br> I can't marry you.<br> We've said goodbye, that's all.<br> - I knew that was so.<br> - Is it making game of me you'd be?<br> It's a queer time to joke with me.<br> Don't be doing it, for the love of God.<br> You don't think I'd kid you now.<br> I'm not joking, Matt. I mean what I say.<br> You don't. You can't.<br> It is mad you are, I'm telling you.<br> - No, I'm not.<br> - What's come over you so sudden?<br> You were saying you love me.<br> I'll say that as often as you want me to.<br> It's true.<br> But why? What? What is it?<br> Because...<br> ...it's the best way I can figure out, Matt.<br> I've been thinking it over and thinking<br> it over, day and night, all week.<br> Oh, don't think it isn't hard<br> on me too, Matt.<br> Well, will you tell me what's preventing<br> this wedding...<br> ...when the two of us has love?<br> I'm thinking it's listening<br> to that old fool you are...<br> ...him hating me, filling your ears<br> full of lies against me.<br> Yes, Anna believe me, not you.<br> She know her old father don't lie like you.<br> You sit down, do you hear?<br> Why do you come butting in<br> and making things worse?<br> You're like a devil, you are.<br> Here I was, beginning to like you,<br> beginning to forget all the things...<br> ...l've held up against you.<br> - You ain't got nothing for hold against me.<br> Haven't I, though? Well, let me tell you.<br> Matt, I'm surprised at you.<br> - You didn't think anything he'd said...<br> - Sure, what else would it be?<br> Tell me, and don't keep me waiting.<br> I can't tell you, and I won't.<br> I've got a good reason,<br> that's all you need to know.<br> I can't marry you,<br> and that's all there is to it.<br> So for heaven's sake,<br> let's talk of something else.<br> No, I'll not.<br> - Is it married to someone else you are?<br> - I should say not.<br> You're like them women<br> can't make up their minds...<br> ...till they're drove to it.<br> Well, I'll make up your mind for you.<br> We've had enough talk.<br> Let's go to the other room...<br> ...and dress in your best.<br> We're going ashore.<br> - She don't do that.<br> - Where do you get that stuff?<br> Never mind,<br> get on with your dressing.<br> - We'll see who'll win in the end, me or you.<br> - Stay, Anna.<br> She will not. She'll do what I say.<br> You've had your hold on her long enough.<br> - It's my turn now.<br> - Your turn? What am I anyway?<br> Never mind what you are.<br> It's what you're gonna be:<br> Wedded to me.<br> Come on with your dressing.<br> - Don't do one thing he say!<br> - She will!<br> - I'm her father.<br> - She will in spite of you.<br> She's taking my orders<br> from now on, not yours.<br> Orders is good.<br> Never mind now.<br> We've no time to be wasting.<br> - Do you hear what I'm telling you?<br> - No, stay here, Anna!<br> You can go to blazes, both of you.<br> You'd think I was a piece of furniture.<br> I'll show you. Sit down.<br> Sit down, do you hear?<br> Let me talk for a minute.<br> You're all wrong, see?<br> I'm gonna tell you two something,<br> and then I'm gonna beat it.<br> I've been meaning<br> to turn it loose on you...<br> ...every time you get my goat<br> with your crazy talk...<br> ...about wanting to keep me safe inland.<br> I wasn't going to tell you,<br> but you've forced me into it.<br> Oh, what's the use?<br> It's all wrong anyway. You might as well<br> get cured this way as any other.<br> Don't forget what you said about it not<br> mattering to you what reason I got...<br> ...as long as I wasn't married already.<br> That's me word, and I'll stick to it.<br> You make me laugh, honest.<br> Wanna bet you will?<br> You wait and see.<br> You was going on as if<br> one of you had to own me.<br> But nobody owns me, see,<br> excepting myself.<br> I'll do what I please. And no man,<br> I don't give a darn who he is...<br> ...can tell me what to do.<br> I ain't asking either of you for a living.<br> I'll make it myself, one way or another.<br> I am my own boss. Now, put that<br> in your pipe and smoke it.<br> - You and your orders.<br> - I wasn't meaning it that way at all...<br> ...and well you know it.<br> You've no call<br> to raise this rumpus with me.<br> - It is him, you've a right.<br> - I'm coming to him.<br> But you, you did mean it that way.<br> You sounded just like all the rest.<br> It is queer, rough talk, that,<br> for a decent girl the like of yourself.<br> Decent. Who told you I was?<br> I'm talking to you now.<br> I don't want to hear.<br> You go out your head, I think.<br> Well, living with you is enough<br> to drive anyone off their nut.<br> Your bunk about the farm being so fine.<br> Didn't I write you, year after year,<br> how rotten it was...<br> ...and what a dirty slave<br> them cousins made out of me?<br> What did you care? Nothing. Not even<br> enough to come out and see me.<br> Your crazy stuff about wanting<br> to keep me away from the sea...<br> ...don't go down with me.<br> You just didn't want<br> to be bothered with me.<br> - Oh, that ain't so, Anna.<br> - But one thing I never wrote you...<br> ...it was one of them cousins<br> that you think is such nice people...<br> ...that started me wrong.<br> And it was none of my fault.<br> I hated him and he knew it.<br> But he was big and strong, like you.<br> That's why I ran away from the farm.<br> That's what made me get a job<br> as a nurse girl in St. Paul.<br> You think that was a nice job<br> for a girl, too, don't you?<br> With all them nice inland fellas<br> just looking for a chance to marry me.<br> They weren't looking for marrying.<br> You don't say nothing.<br> Either one of you.<br> But I know what you're thinking.<br> You're just like all the rest.<br> And who's to blame for it? Me or you?<br> If you'd been a regular father<br> and had me with you...<br> ...things would've been different.<br> - Don't talk that way.<br> - I go crazy. I won't listen to you.<br> - You will listen.<br> You, keeping me safe inland.<br> I was no nurse girl the last two years.<br> I lied when I wrote you.<br> I was in a house, that's what.<br> Yes, that kind of a house.<br> The kind that sailors like Matt and you<br> go to in port...<br> ...and your nice inland men too.<br> And all men.<br> I hate them, I hate them...<br> - Oh, it's a lie, Anna, it's a lie...<br> - So...<br> ...that's what's in it.<br> I suppose you remember your promise.<br> No other reason was to count with you<br> as long as I wasn't married already.<br> You want me to get dressed<br> and go ashore, don't you?<br> Oh, yes, you do.<br> I suppose if I tried to tell you<br> that I wasn't that no more...<br> ...you'd believe me, wouldn't you?<br> And if I told you that just getting out<br> on this barge and being on the sea...<br> ...had changed me and made me<br> feel different about things...<br> ...as if all that I've been through<br> wasn't me, didn't count...<br> ...it was just like it never happened...<br> ...you'd laugh, wouldn't you?<br> And you'd die laughing,<br> I'm sure, if I told you...<br> ...that meeting you that funny way<br> that night in the fog...<br> ...and afterwards, seeing that you were<br> straight good stuck on me...<br> ...had got me to thinking<br> for the first time in my life.<br> And I sized you up as different from<br> the ones on land, as water is from mud.<br> I couldn't marry you<br> with you believing a lie.<br> And I was ashamed to tell you the truth.<br> And now, give me<br> a bawling-out and beat it...<br> ...like I can tell you're going to.<br> Will you believe it...<br> ...if I tell you that loving you<br> has made me clean?<br> It's straight goods, honest.<br> Oh, yes, you will.<br> You're just like all the rest.<br> The rest, is it?<br> My curse on you. Clean, is it?<br> Oh, don't, Matt. Get out of here.<br> Let me alone. Get out of here!<br> I'll be going. And I'll be<br> drinking slews of whiskey...<br> ...so to wash that<br> black kiss of yours off me lips!<br> And I'd be getting dead, rotten drunk<br> so I'll not remember you at all!<br> I'll ship away on a boat to the end of the<br> world, where I'll never see your face again!<br> - Oh, don't go. It's better Anna marry you...<br> - Let go of me, you old ape!<br> Marry her, is it?<br> I'd see her dead at me feet first.<br> I'm shipping away out of this,<br> I'm telling you.<br> My curse on you,<br> and the curse of all the saints.<br> - I go ashore too.<br> - Not after him, I tell you.<br> Don't you dare.<br> Oh, I go for get drink.<br> I'm driving you to drink too, huh?<br> You wanna get drunk<br> so you can forget, like him.<br> Aye. You think I like hear<br> them things? Oh, Anna.<br> Anna, I think you wasn't that kind of girl.<br> You want me to beat it, don't you?<br> You don't want me here<br> disgracing you, I suppose.<br> Oh, no, no, Anna. You stay here.<br> It ain't your fault, I know that.<br> It's that old devil do this to me.<br> It was all right on barge,<br> with just you and me.<br> Then she bring that Irish fellow in fog.<br> That fella, he don't<br> never come, you don't...<br> ...never tell me them things.<br> I don't never know.<br> Then everything is all right.<br> Oh, that dirty devil sea.<br> Oh, what's the use?<br> Go ashore and get drunk.<br> You wait here, Anna?<br> Maybe. Maybe not.<br> Maybe I'll get drunk too. Maybe I'll...<br> Go on and beat it.<br> It's foggy outside.<br> Oh, God.<br> - What's the trouble? Feeling sick?<br> - Inside my head feels sick.<br> Oh, Anna, you think maybe sometime<br> you forgive me, Anna?<br> - I'll forgive you right now.<br> - Oh, Anna lilla.<br> Oh, don't bawl about it.<br> There ain't nothing to forgive anyway.<br> It ain't your fault, it ain't mine.<br> It ain't his, neither.<br> I fix everything all right<br> for you and me, Anna.<br> Yes?<br> Then you and me will stick together?<br> We'll work for each other<br> and help each other, huh?<br> - What is it you fixed?<br> - Well, I sign on steamer Londonderry.<br> Sail for Cape Town tomorrow.<br> Oh, Anna, I only bring you bad luck.<br> That's how you fix me, is it?<br> Well, I think that old devil get me back...<br> ...maybe she leave you alone, then.<br> Oh, can't you see that you're doing<br> the same thing that you've always done?<br> Can't you see that?<br> Oh, what's the use of talking?<br> You ain't right.<br> I'll never blame you anymore.<br> Oh, Anna.<br> You forgive me, sure?<br> Surely I do. You ain't to blame.<br> You're just what you are, like me.<br> And you, you let me<br> kiss you once again, eh?<br> - Oh, sure, no hard feelings.<br> - Oh, Anna lilla.<br> I can't say it, Anna.<br> I think I go lie down, go to sleep.<br> Oh, that booze, he don't go well, Anna.<br> I think I'm never going to drink again.<br> I can't stand this much longer.<br> What am I waiting for, anyhow,<br> like a darn fool?<br> Anna?<br> - Anna?<br> - Yes, what do you want?<br> Don't say it. I know what's in your mind.<br> Yes, that's what I was,<br> and that's what I'm going back to.<br> I'd kill you first. And finish it up.<br> It's a dog's life I been living<br> since I found out what you are.<br> Oh, why don't you leave me alone.<br> Go away.<br> Don't you see I'm licked? What do you<br> want to keep kicking me for?<br> Don't you deserve the worst I'd say,<br> God forgive you?<br> All right, maybe I do. But don't rub it in.<br> Why haven't you done<br> what you said you were going to?<br> Ship away to the other side of the earth,<br> where you don't have to see me.<br> - I have.<br> - What?<br> You're going away, honest?<br> I signed on, drunk as I was,<br> and she's sailing tomorrow.<br> - Where is she going? Far away?<br> - Cape Town. It is at the end of Africa.<br> That's far for you.<br> - What's the boat's name?<br> - The Londonderry.<br> The Londonderry?<br> Oh, this is too much.<br> Faith, I don't blame you<br> for laughing at me.<br> True, it is the fool of the world I am<br> to come back to talk to you at all.<br> Oh, what's the use? What's the use of<br> me talking? What's the use of anything?<br> Anna...<br> Anna, if I could only be believing<br> I was the only man in the world...<br> ...ever you had love for,<br> I could be forgetting the rest, maybe.<br> Are you trying to accuse me<br> of being in love...<br> ...really in love, with them?<br> You fool, you.<br> I've stood enough from you.<br> Love them, is it? I hated them, I tell you.<br> And may God strike me dead,<br> and my mother too, if she was alive...<br> ...if I'm not telling you the honest truth.<br> Oh, sure, Anna, if I could only<br> be believing you, now.<br> Why, Matt, you've got to believe it.<br> What can I do? What will I do<br> to prove to you I'm not lying?<br> Anna, would you...? Would you be willing<br> to swear an oath, a terrible, fearful oath?<br> Oh, sure, I will, Matt, on anything.<br> Would you swear on this?<br> Oh, sure. Give it to me.<br> It is a cross given to me by me mother,<br> God rest her soul.<br> And I'm telling you,<br> it has great power in it.<br> And I'm warning you now,<br> if you swear on this...<br> ...it is me old woman herself who'd<br> be looking down on you from heaven...<br> ...and praying the saints to put a curse<br> on you if she hears you swear a lie.<br> I wouldn't have the nerve,<br> honest, Matt, if it was a lie.<br> But it's the truth,<br> and I ain't scared to swear it.<br> Give it to me. What do you<br> want me to swear? You say it.<br> Swear I'm the only man in the world<br> ever you felt love for.<br> I swear it. I swear it by God.<br> And may the blackest curse of God<br> strike you if you're lying.<br> And may the blackest curse of God<br> strike me if I'm lying.<br> Oh, glory be to God,<br> I'm after believing you now.<br> - Now what's the matter?<br> - Is it Catholic you are?<br> - No, why?<br> - Oh, God pity me.<br> Sure, it's some devil's treachery in it.<br> You swearing on a Catholic cross,<br> and you one of the others.<br> - Well, don't you believe me, Matt?<br> - Oh, but if it ain't a Catholic you are...<br> I ain't nothing, Matt.<br> What's the difference?<br> Didn't you hear me swear?<br> I'm afraid I love you, God forgive me,<br> no matter what you are.<br> I'd be going mad if I'd not be having you.<br> I'd be killing the world.<br> We'll be wedded this day.<br> And we'll be happy, the two of us,<br> in spite of the devil.<br> Well, we gotta have a drink on this,<br> my good man.<br> - Blast you.<br> - That's the way to talk.<br> Oh, Matt, it's time for you two<br> to kiss and make up.<br> You'll be shipmates<br> on the Londonderry, you know.<br> - Shipmates? Has himself...?<br> - Aye, and I'm boatswain on her.<br> The devil!<br> You'd be shipping away to sea<br> and leaving her alone again, will you?<br> It's all right, Matt. That's where<br> he belongs, and I want him to go.<br> You've gotta go too.<br> We'll need the money.<br> And as for me being alone, why,<br> that runs in the family...<br> ...and I'll get used to it.<br> I'll get a house somewhere and I'll make<br> a regular place for you two to come back.<br> And now you'll drink<br> and be friends, huh?<br> Sure.<br> - Here's luck to you.<br> - Skoal.<br> Well, you'll not be lonesome long.<br> I'll see to that, God willing.<br> Sure as himself will be having<br> a grandchild riding his foot, I tell you.<br> - Maybe twins.<br> - Oh, quit your kidding.<br> Is it any religion at all you have,<br> you and your Anna?<br> Well, in the old country,<br> we was Lutherans.<br> Lutherans, is it?<br> Oh, then I'm damned entirely.<br> Oh, well, what's the difference?<br> It is God's will anyhow.<br> It's queer, you and me<br> shipping on same boat that way.<br> That ain't right.<br> It's that funny way old devil sea<br> do her worst dirty tricks.<br> Aye, is so.<br> Faith, I'm afraid you've the right of it<br> for once, devil take you.<br> Why, gee, Matt, you ain't<br> agreeing with him, are you?<br> Come on. Here's to the sea,<br> no matter what.<br> Be a game sport, man. Drink to that.<br> Fog, fog all time.<br> You can't tell where you was going.<br> Only that old devil sea.<br> She knows.<br>
