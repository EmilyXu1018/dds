The harem, you mean?<br> - Yes.<br> It's, uh, quite a place.<br> I've heard it called the universe,<br> with a single sun and a thousand moons.<br> - The king being the sun, naturally.<br> - Good gracious.<br> They run a bit to language out here.<br> They say too that he's the disc of light<br> they all revolve around.<br> How many women revolve<br> around this disc of light?<br> Oh, a thousand or more.<br> Really?<br> The book didn't mention that.<br> I haven't anything against that book of yours,<br> Mrs Owens, but look here.<br> This is Siam.<br> There isn't even a consulate here.<br> - You see...<br> - (elephant trumpets)<br> Hello!<br> Someone to meet me, I suppose.<br> (captain speaks Siamese)<br> Mrs Owens, may I present His Excellency<br> the Kralahome, prime minister of Siam.<br> (captain speaks Siamese) Mem Anna Owens.<br> Are you lady who is to teach<br> children of royal family?<br> - Yes.<br> - Have you friends in Bangkok?<br> No. I know no one in Bangkok at all.<br> Are you married?<br> I was married. My husband is dead.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> (interpreter) How long<br> your husband been dead?<br> About a year.<br> What manner of man, your husband?<br> He was an officer<br> in Her Majesty's Army, serving in...<br> Ask His Excellency<br> why it is necessary to know these things.<br> - (interpreter speaks Siamese)<br> - (speaks Siamese)<br> My master says if he ask,<br> it should be enough for mem to answer.<br> Tell your master that his business with me<br> is in my capacity as governess.<br> It is not necessary for him<br> to pry into my personal affairs.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> My master graciously says mem need not<br> talk at all. His slaves will take her to palace.<br> - Tell him to wait.<br> - (captain speaks Siamese)<br> I was promised a house of my own would be<br> provided on my arrival. I wish to go there.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> My master says if mem does not wish to go<br> to palace, she can go wherever she pleases.<br> That's the rudest man I ever met in my life.<br> If your book was any good, you'd have known<br> they ask personal questions here to be polite.<br> And he wasn't being rude.<br> He came out to meet you in person.<br> And you're a woman, and women do not exist<br> in Siam. They simply do not exist.<br> I hope I'll have nothing more to do with him.<br> My dear young woman, you'd better realise<br> you can't do anything out here without him.<br> If I were you I'd try to see him in the morning,<br> say you didn't understand and you're sorry.<br> Or as near it as you can manage.<br> Well, looks like you sleep on board tonight.<br> Means I can't go with you in the morning<br> and be down the river early.<br> Oh, well, I'll find someone.<br> - Thank you, Captain Orton.<br> - Not at all, ma'am.<br> And don't worry, ma'am.<br> The king has invested money in your<br> passage, and he's very canny about money.<br> He'll see that you have<br> a chance to do your work.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> (speaking Siamese)<br> He's not gonna wait for us.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> Good morning. I wish to see your master.<br> I will see. You will wait.<br> - They write in such a funny way here.<br> - Don't be rude. Come here and wait quietly.<br> - You will come this way.<br> - Thank you.<br> You will wait.<br> - What shall I draw now?<br> - Well, let's see. Draw an elephant.<br> I just did. I wish we could go.<br> We're going to wait.<br> My master wishes to know<br> why you come here. What you want.<br> Tell His Excellency I did not understand<br> the honour he paid me in coming to meet me.<br> I'm sorry I behaved ungraciously,<br> and I came here to tell him so.<br> (speaking Siamese)<br> My master wishes to know if mem<br> truly regret sin of having bad temper,<br> or if she only says so<br> in order to ask favour of him.<br> I'm...<br> Tell him it's both. I am sorry, and I would like<br> his help in getting started with my work.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> Why hasn't he a coat on?<br> You make me wear one.<br> - Quiet, dear.<br> - Let's go. I don't think I like him.<br> (Kralahome laughs)<br> What is your name, boy?<br> Louis Owens, sir.<br> - Are you afraid of me?<br> - I don't think so.<br> That is good. I like you.<br> - Take a seat. Sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> Your Excellency speaks English.<br> I-I didn't know.<br> Not necessary to know everything<br> in first minutes.<br> What for you object to live in palace?<br> I must have a place of my own where I can go<br> when my duties are over for the day.<br> What you wish to do evenings<br> that cannot be done in palace?<br> You don't understand, Your Excellency.<br> It isn't some foolish reason.<br> I came here to teach because I must work<br> to support myself and my son.<br> - Why you not marry again?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Not ever.<br> The only thing I want now<br> is to bring up my son.<br> He's very like his father,<br> and I want him to grow up that way.<br> That's very difficult in a strange country.<br> That's why we must have a home of our own.<br> This is very important to me,<br> Your Excellency. Please believe that.<br> - You say king promise you house?<br> - Yes, Your Excellency. I have the letters.<br> You do not show me. I do not think you lie.<br> But sometime His Majesty<br> do not remember everything he promise.<br> But couldn't you remind him?<br> Mem, if I tell king he breaks his promise,<br> I will make anger in him.<br> I think it is better if I make anger in him<br> about larger matters.<br> Very well. If you're afraid to tell him, I'm not.<br> Will you arrange for me to see him?<br> You think you tell king<br> he breaks his promise?<br> Yes, if that's necessary. If he wants to get<br> angry about breaking his own promise...<br> Mem, I think I arrange this meeting for you.<br> When?<br> I do not know. His Majesty very busy now.<br> Is he too busy to remember<br> he asked me to come here?<br> Unfortunately, New Year and you<br> arrive at same time.<br> New Year more important.<br> But it wouldn't take 10 minutes of his time...<br> After New Year, festival called Songkran, with<br> fireworks. That will take week or so, maybe.<br> - Then is cremation of late cousin...<br> - But surely...<br> ..and His Majesty goes up river<br> to receive sacred white elephant.<br> Then ceremonies of tonsure of hair<br> of oldest daughter.<br> And what am I supposed to do<br> in the meantime?<br> - Wait. Live in palace and wait.<br> - But this is ridiculous. I came here to teach.<br> Mem, this country has been here thousand<br> years before you came, and must continue.<br> That may be, but I intend to keep my part of<br> the bargain, and I expect the king to keep his.<br> Mem, I do not think<br> king will remember this promise,<br> but I do think will be<br> very interesting meeting.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> I don't think we'd better open this one. It's full<br> of things I didn't know what to do with.<br> - (tearfully) Yes, memsahib.<br> - Oh, Beebe, do stop crying.<br> I told you, Moonshee<br> will probably be here any minute.<br> I think I shall never see him again. They said<br> that he could not live here with us, and...<br> Nonsense. You must have misunderstood.<br> It's just that there isn't room for him here.<br> - Yes, memsahib.<br> - Do you remember where I put the sheets?<br> - I see fireworks.<br> - It's New Year's Day.<br> No, it isn't, Mother. It's only April.<br> It's New Year's out here.<br> I won't sleep a wink tonight unless<br> we have our own sheets on those beds.<br> - After dinner, may we go see the fireworks?<br> - We'll see.<br> Ah, yes. They're in here, I remember now.<br> There, Beebe.<br> All right. Come on, darling.<br> Now I'll see about dinner.<br> We would like to have some dinner.<br> Something to eat.<br> Eat.<br> No, wait a moment.<br> What part of the palace are we in?<br> Well, poor souls,<br> they don't seem to understand.<br> What made them shut the door?<br> Ah.<br> I don't know.<br> - What are they doing there?<br> - Oh!<br> Oh, no.<br> So that's why Moonshee<br> can't be here with us.<br> Oh, Louis...<br> Beebe...<br> What a thing for me to do.<br> And I said so positively.<br> Oh, Louis, you'll have to forgive your mother.<br> I said we'd have a home of our own,<br> and I've brought you into a harem.<br> What does that mean, Mother?<br> What is a harem?<br> Well, it's... (laughs)<br> Oh, don't ask me that.<br> I should have a good answer, and I will,<br> but I just can't think of one now. (sobs)<br> - Do I have to wear this suit, Mother?<br> - Don't sulk, dear. Come, we must hurry.<br> Where did I put my...? Oh, here it is.<br> The day is here, Mem Owens.<br> It is unfortunate mem had to wait<br> for New Year and cremation,<br> but at least she is ahead of white elephant.<br> Who is going to present me to the king?<br> Oh, by all means, I present you myself.<br> First, let us observe manner<br> of entering presence of His Majesty.<br> Let us suppose Lord of Light sits here.<br> Here is door. (speaks Siamese)<br> - Oh, no.<br> - It is custom of country.<br> I couldn't. I'm very sorry, but I couldn't.<br> His Majesty very sensitive<br> about such matters.<br> Your Excellency, I intend<br> to show His Majesty the utmost respect,<br> but he cannot possibly expect me<br> to crawl along the floor.<br> I wouldn't do that for my own queen.<br> What you do in presence of your own queen?<br> I'll show you.<br> Do as you wish, mem.<br> But remember, you are not only one<br> with temper. This king has temper too.<br> I'll return when it is time.<br> You will wait.<br> Mother, I can walk on my knees<br> if they want me to. That's easy.<br> You'll walk in and make your bow<br> exactly as I've shown you.<br> Don't you dare crawl in like a worm.<br> Don't you dare!<br> Yes, Mother.<br> Perhaps they don't like us here.<br> The whole thing is perfectly childish.<br> If mem is ready now...?<br> Quite ready.<br> Sorry, mem.<br> His Majesty has concluded audience.<br> - He isn't going to receive us after all?<br> - Some other day. Not today.<br> - I wish to be presented now.<br> - I do not advise it.<br> Louis.<br> Who? Who? Who?<br> Your Majesty, I present new English<br> governess Mrs Anna Owens, and son Louis.<br> How old shall you be?<br> You do not look like scientific person<br> for teaching of school. How old shall you be?<br> I am 150 years old, Your Majesty.<br> In what year were you borned?<br> - And how many years shall you be married?<br> - Several, Your Majesty.<br> How many grandchildren shall you have by<br> now? How many? How many? How many?<br> You do not answer that so quick.<br> I make better questions<br> than you make answers, hm?<br> (he laughs)<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> (all laugh)<br> You not afraid to tell king<br> something is not his business?<br> It would not be a compliment to His Majesty<br> if I were afraid of him.<br> Ah.<br> Not to be afraid<br> is good thing in scientific mind.<br> I think maybe...<br> you will make very good schoolteaching.<br> These my wives.<br> This Chow Chon Son Klin,<br> who is favourite.<br> They not speak English. I cannot teach, being<br> busy with foreign affairs and other situations.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> Will get my children.<br> I have fine idea. You teach<br> all my wives as have sense to learn.<br> Siam be very modern country.<br> Very good. Everybody speaking English.<br> I would be happy to, Your Majesty.<br> Ah. Here come my children.<br> You see? Mostly boys.<br> Not all. Few more.<br> Ah.<br> Oh.<br> How many are there, Your Majesty?<br> They are not all here, of course.<br> Only those old enough for school.<br> I have 67 children. Not many.<br> I began marriage a little late.<br> Which is the eldest?<br> Ah. This one. This is Prince Chulalongkorn.<br> This... Princess Fa-Ying.<br> This Prince Tae Wa Wong. This...<br> No. Too many. Will take time to learn.<br> They're a wonderful-looking family,<br> Your Majesty. You make me wish I had 67.<br> Ha! Is impossible. That is very funny.<br> Come.<br> I consider Mrs Owens suitable<br> for teaching wives as well as children.<br> Thank you.<br> You begin school next Thursday. Best day for<br> such undertaking, according to astrologers.<br> Very well, Your Majesty.<br> I am very pleased with this lady.<br> Why was she not presented here more soon?<br> "How many grandchildren?" (chuckles)<br> You may go.<br> Good day, Your Excellency.<br> Come, darling.<br> - Is this the school?<br> - I don't know, dear, but we'll find out soon.<br> Don't they even start school on time here?<br> Perhaps the astrologers<br> found a star they'd overlooked.<br> (gong)<br> - What's the matter now, Mother?<br> - I don't know.<br> Must have something to do with the king.<br> (king shouting)<br> June 12, 1862! June 12, 1862!<br> He is fool! Do you understand<br> meaning of word "agility"?<br> Well, I think Your Majesty's giving<br> a very good illustration of it.<br> You see? She understands!<br> This ignorant and lazy man is my secretary.<br> Understands nothing!<br> All he ever wants to do is sleep! Sleep!<br> On June 12, 1862, which is today<br> and therefore birthday for me.<br> You see I am young, strong.<br> - I have agility like young man.<br> - Of course, Your Majesty.<br> Then how can I be "spare man"? How can l?<br> Perhaps if Your Majesty<br> could explain a little more...<br> Birthday should be happy day.<br> And what is first happening?<br> It is writing about me in British newspaper<br> from Singapore says I am "spare man".<br> A king cannot be "spare man"!<br> How can I be spared<br> from work which is necessary?<br> Who can fill my place?<br> I ask you this! Who can fill my place?<br> Your Majesty,<br> the word "spare" has two meanings.<br> One of them is "extra". The other is "thin".<br> They don't mean to say<br> that you are unnecessary. Just thin.<br> Why shall you contradict me?<br> - I'm only trying to help you.<br> - Is it help to say I am wrong?<br> How can king be wrong and woman be right?<br> I ask you that. How?<br> I am afraid, Your Majesty,<br> that it has happened sometimes.<br> It is clear you are not scientific.<br> Why are you here?<br> Because you told me<br> you intended opening my school today.<br> My astrologers are fools.<br> How can this be good day for schools?<br> You may go.<br> Very well, Your Majesty.<br> But since you postponed opening the school,<br> there's something I'd like to discuss.<br> I should like to use the time<br> in getting settled in my own house.<br> - House? House? House?<br> - The house you promised me.<br> Conditions different suddenly.<br> Have you not agreed to teach our women?<br> - Of course I have, Your Majesty.<br> - How can you teach them if you live outside?<br> It is our pleasure<br> that you shall reside within this palace.<br> If Your Majesty remembers,<br> you promised me a house.<br> I will do remembering of what I promise.<br> Who is king here?<br> I remind you.<br> I do not know condition which will arise.<br> I do not know anything<br> but that you are my servant,<br> and that it is our pleasure<br> that you shall reside within this palace.<br> And you shall obey.<br> I am prepared to obey all your commands as<br> far as they concern my duties as a teacher...<br> You shall live in palace.<br> You shall live in palace! You shall...<br> Come back!<br> Come back!<br> I command you, come back!<br> That king hasn't very good manners.<br> His mother didn't teach him not to shout.<br> Women don't seem<br> to count for very much out here.<br> "How can a king be wrong<br> and a woman be right?"<br> Well, the disc of light<br> isn't going to talk to me like that.<br> Beebe, take Louis into the other room.<br> Yes? What do you want?<br> I have been ordered into forbidden city<br> so I could personally conduct mem<br> to house His Majesty has<br> graciously decided she should have.<br> - A house outside the palace?<br> - His Majesty instruct me to say<br> he desire to observe fully<br> terms of his promise.<br> Well...<br> Is this it?<br> Get out of my way.<br> Get out of my way!<br> What was it like? Is there a stable<br> for my pony when I get it? Is it on the river?<br> Oh, Louis, it was horrible.<br> And he did it deliberately<br> to teach me a lesson, to put me in my place.<br> Well, he'll rue this day, let me tell you.<br> If he knows the meaning of the word "rue".<br> Unpack these things, Beebe.<br> Unpack everything.<br> - But, memsahib, you said...<br> - It doesn't make any difference what I said.<br> That man's going to give me a house before l<br> leave if I have to stay here the rest of my life.<br> I'll not just go away and let him sit here<br> laughing at me. (sobs) I'll not.<br> Mrs Owens has graciously changed her<br> plans, so will live in royal palace<br> and be free for question of education<br> at all times.<br> I command you to be diligent,<br> and to make most of this opportunity<br> for sake of yourselves and country.<br> We will come to attention, please.<br> (all talk)<br> Order, please!<br> Quiet! Order, please! Quiet!<br> Order! Quiet!<br> Quiet! Quiet! Order, please.<br> Quiet! Order!<br> Don't any of you<br> understand any English at all?<br> (shrieks)<br> (talking stops)<br> They think you wear dress like that...<br> because you're shaped like that, down there.<br> You speak English.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> I am very glad to see you.<br> I think of you very often.<br> In the beginning,<br> God created the heaven and the earth.<br> - Missionary.<br> - Oh.<br> A missionary taught you English?<br> Thiang.<br> - Lady Thiang?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> How fortunate. I shall ask you to help me<br> in explaining to the others.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> We shall now begin the class.<br> The usual way to begin<br> would be with the English alphabet.<br> But I should like to impress His Majesty<br> with the way English people feel.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> Therefore, we will begin<br> by learning a song or two,<br> or a sentence or two,<br> which will express English feeling.<br> For instance, this one.<br> It's an old proverb.<br> "lf a man break faith with me,<br> shame on him."<br> "But if I let him deceive me twice,<br> shame on me."<br> It is not good day. I feel it.<br> There will not be many gifts this morning.<br> Who shall this be?<br> My name is Tuptim.<br> She was sent by governor of Lao province.<br> She is daughter of his youngest brother.<br> Ah.<br> What favour shall this governor want now?<br> Never mind. Write letter. Say thank you.<br> Make it nice letter.<br> Where this come from?<br> I do not know, Your Majesty.<br> There is writing on it.<br> Read it to me, O my father.<br> You would not understand it, little one.<br> But I have studied a month now.<br> The English memcha says I am very clever<br> and you will be pleased.<br> Tell me something<br> that you have learned in school.<br> Good morning. This is a thought for the day.<br> "A promise delayed is justice deferred."<br> "A promise neglected is the truth untold."<br> "East or west,<br> home is best."<br> (women singing)<br> ? Home, home, sweet sweet home<br> ? There's no place like home<br> ? There's no place like home<br> (singing continues, muffled)<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> ? Be it ever so humble<br> ? There's no place like home...<br> That will do for today. Now I think<br> it's time we started learning our alphabet.<br> Look on your slates and listen<br> while I pronounce the letters.<br> A.<br> B.<br> C.<br> D.<br> E.<br> Oh, good morning, Your Majesty.<br> Are you going to say something<br> to our class this morning?<br> No.<br> F.<br> G...<br> (man singing "Home, Sweet Home")<br> ? There's no place like home...<br> No singing here. If singing necessary, I sing.<br> Your Majesty.<br> It has begun, Toongramon.<br> We've lost Cambodia.<br> Our governor of Cambodia made<br> a treaty with the French government.<br> They recognised Cambodia as independent<br> of Siam, placed it under their protection.<br> And this governor of ours<br> still protests his loyalty to Your Majesty.<br> So...<br> The camel's nose is in the tent.<br> The partition of Siam. It has begun.<br> For a long time<br> we've said this hour must come.<br> Now it is no longer talk, it is upon us.<br> What do we do?<br> Nothing.<br> We shall do nothing whatever in this matter.<br> Because there is nothing we can do.<br> Your father took such a man once<br> and burned out both his eyes.<br> Hung him in the sun in a cage<br> over cool running water,<br> until he went mad.<br> We have not the right to waste ourselves<br> on something which cannot be changed.<br> We shall save what strength and cunning<br> we have to hold together what is left of Siam.<br> And if we cannot save all that is left,<br> we shall save what we can.<br> Tell me something, Toongramon.<br> A long time ago, I came to you and asked you<br> to leave a life of peace and be the king.<br> If I could ask you now to make that choice,<br> what would your answer be?<br> Think well before you answer that.<br> Think what this can mean to you.<br> You feel great responsibility for me,<br> don't you, Cha Kum?<br> You might still be living peacefully<br> at the monastery if I had not persuaded you.<br> Perhaps it is not too late to return.<br> Think well on that.<br> The monastery, instead of this place<br> where you have only enemies and danger.<br> Well you know this is not the end.<br> The ships of Europe will crowd thicker<br> on our seas, greedy for conquest.<br> They have the power.<br> And the cunning.<br> They know how to set your nobles<br> against you, how to buy and threaten them.<br> How can you hope to hold Siam together<br> against enemies without and within?<br> All that it can mean to you is that<br> in the end you will die in a lost cause.<br> I have done you a sorry service<br> to have brought you to this moment.<br> I think you take too much credit<br> on yourself, Cha Kum.<br> There is a man born for every task,<br> and I was born for this one.<br> Remember, I was prince before I was monk.<br> Let me ask you.<br> If you were in my place,<br> what would your answer be?<br> Then give me as much credit<br> as you allow yourself, my friend.<br> If only we had more time.<br> (? "Home, Sweet Home" on reed pipe)<br> - She's got someone else at it.<br> - "She"?<br> That woman and her house!<br> - Stop it!<br> - (music stops)<br> Take a lesson from her, my friend,<br> and you will never give up on anything.<br> - Give her a house.<br> - But...<br> Give her a house! If she was meant<br> to be a sign to us, she deserves a reward.<br> And if she wasn't...<br> Well, give her a house anyway,<br> before she drives me out of my mind.<br> - Very nice.<br> - Yes, mem.<br> No fish here.<br> No fish.<br> You like it?<br> I could be quite comfortable here.<br> It is of course our wish<br> that mem shall be perfectly satisfied.<br> Oh, I am. Perfectly, Your Excellency.<br> I said I'd get a house, and I got it.<br> But now you may go to the king<br> and tell him he can have it back.<br> I wouldn't live in it<br> if it had a roof made of rubies.<br> And you can tell him something else too.<br> I wouldn't live in a country where<br> promises mean nothing. Simply nothing.<br> I won't stay a minute longer than I have to,<br> not if he gave me the whole palace to live in.<br> Good day, Your Excellency.<br> I'll find out what time we sail. I think we can<br> go aboard ship first thing in the morning.<br> If Louis wakes up, tell him I'll be back soon.<br> Yes, memsahib.<br> How dare you treat me in this manner?<br> I demand an explanation. And I warn you...<br> - Be quiet, sir.<br> -..that I am a British subject.<br> That is not reason you are safe.<br> I could have you killed if that would serve<br> my purpose. Such things are simple here.<br> Sir, you enjoy your triumph<br> about your house.<br> Cos you shall now enjoy greater triumph.<br> I have something to ask of you.<br> Not demand, but ask.<br> It is that you shall stay in Siam.<br> You may enjoy yourself if you like, sir.<br> No matter what you asked, I wouldn't do it.<br> - If you do not stay, where will you go?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Have you other place to put your life?<br> - What's it to do with you?<br> - Have you, sir?<br> - Please stop calling me "sir"!<br> I call you "sir"<br> so you will not be lowly, like a woman.<br> But you continue to talk like a woman,<br> I no longer call you "sir".<br> You think now you are nothing here,<br> but that could be different.<br> How could it be, as long as the king can<br> change his mind from one day to another?<br> - The king is not ordinary man.<br> - lndeed he isn't.<br> - He is lonely man.<br> - "Lonely"!<br> Mem, I have watched you.<br> I think there is need here for you.<br> You know what is truth about many things,<br> and I know you have courage to speak it.<br> The king has no one near him like you. He has<br> many wives, but they cannot help him.<br> You can speak with him as a woman,<br> where they cannot.<br> He will listen, because he will know<br> you do not seek something for yourself.<br> Indeed I wouldn't. Least of all the chance<br> to revolve around him. He doesn't need help.<br> Mem, why you not see? Why?<br> He is two men.<br> One part of him is king, like his father was.<br> Other part tries to be man of new world.<br> Scientific man who desires to learn<br> all modern things, to save his country.<br> But greedy men of Europe are at our door.<br> They say Siam is barbaric land<br> and so must be ruled by them.<br> So king must learn all modern things now.<br> He tries work too big for any man,<br> with no one to help.<br> His own people are his enemies.<br> They do not want change.<br> And sometimes inside himself is enemy...<br> that cannot change.<br> Oh, mem, are you blind?<br> Have you no eyes to see?<br> He does not live coldly, with mind, as I do.<br> But with heart.<br> With heart, mem, as king must.<br> And so is torn in two within himself.<br> And to whom can he turn? Who can he trust?<br> He is very lonely man.<br> And very strange man.<br> Yet for him I would die.<br> I'm...<br> I'm afraid I haven't been very understanding.<br> Mem, I cannot promise<br> that it will ever be easy for you.<br> We have proverb here.<br> "Go up by land and you meet tiger,<br> go down by water and you meet crocodile."<br> But for you, it will be place to put your life.<br> "Your Majesty once suggested that I might<br> possibly be of some slight help to him<br> with his correspondence<br> and in the translation of..."<br> Ah!<br> Alak, take letter.<br> To Mrs A Owens, by our gracious consent,<br> governess of the court of Siam,<br> et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br> Dear Madam, I have your letter<br> in which you make offer of assistance.<br> In reply, I beg to state, you were engaged<br> for teaching school. Not otherwise.<br> You shall ask yourself, are your scholars<br> now interested in facility of language<br> more than certain songs and proverbs<br> concerning houses?<br> (chuckles)<br> ? L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, ? U, V, W, X, Y, Z<br> ? A, B, C, D, E, F, G<br> There seems to be definitely no answer.<br> (students continue singing)<br> (students stop singing and laugh)<br> Do you speak English?<br> My family speak some English a long time.<br> - What is your name?<br> - Tuptim.<br> He's very amusing, but none of us<br> can do any work while he's here.<br> You'd better take him outside<br> until school is over.<br> He will be good, mem.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> He's really very clever.<br> But I cannot allow him to stay.<br> Take him out now, Tuptim.<br> If he make people to laugh<br> in this dull palace, that is good.<br> I don't want to have to make<br> a report of this to His Majesty.<br> His Majesty give him to me.<br> But not to bring to school.<br> Go to the king...<br> if you like.<br> Mem...<br> Do not make quarrel with<br> new favourite of the king. You will lose.<br> Tuptim...?<br> Let's get on with our work now, please.<br> We've lost enough time.<br> Mem, there is thing in this book<br> I do not believe.<br> What is it, Prince Chulalongkorn?<br> It shows world like round ball<br> that spins on stick through middle.<br> And everyone knows<br> that world rest on back of great turtle,<br> who keeps it from running into stars.<br> - Where did you get the book?<br> - I gave it to him.<br> - But you shouldn't without asking me.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> There are many stories about the world,<br> and when we're further along with our studies<br> I shall explain them to you.<br> For the present,<br> I think we'd better stick to our letters.<br> But I know all my letters, mem.<br> A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, l...<br> (laughter)<br> Quiet, please!<br> I know that you are very quick to learn,<br> and I shall do all I can to help you,<br> but for the present<br> I wish you to recite with the class.<br> Oh.<br> You wanted to see me, Lady Thiang?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm glad you've stayed. I wanted to thank you<br> for warning me about Tuptim.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I don't quite understand<br> about Tuptim being the favourite.<br> I thought the Lady Son Klin...<br> Why you think Lady Son Klin not here?<br> - I thought perhaps she was ill, or...<br> - She in prison.<br> - But what for?<br> - Because she gamble too much.<br> Which is law. But she do not go to prison<br> for this if she is still favourite.<br> - Is there anything we can do?<br> - She is young.<br> She will become used to such things.<br> I will help her when this can be done.<br> But it is hard. I not in favour with my lord.<br> Oh.<br> Not for long time.<br> My lord's table - I taste food there. That is all.<br> - For fear of poison?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Guard my lord. That is all.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - No, sir.<br> No, not for me sorry.<br> I am... (speaks Siamese)<br> Mother royal prince.<br> - Prince Chulalongkorn?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Yes. My little boy.<br> - You like little boy?<br> - Yes, of course.<br> You think my little boy... Iearn?<br> - Yes, he seems very bright.<br> - Please, mem...<br> You do not mind that it is hard for him?<br> Hard to learn from woman.<br> He wants much to learn.<br> Please - you will help him<br> to learn all wisdom.<br> That is most important thing.<br> Yes, of course.<br> And I'm sure he'll do beautifully.<br> Well, after today<br> I think I can manage a large cup of tea.<br> Louis!<br> Thank you, Lady Thiang, for all your help.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> Ready for tea? I'm sure I am.<br> Well, we might as well, I suppose.<br> Oh, dear. What seems to be the trouble?<br> - I think you'd better tell me.<br> - Well, I can't make any sense out of it.<br> He says nobody can touch his head because<br> it's sacred. And his shoulders are, almost.<br> Anyone who struck me upon head<br> would have to be killed.<br> When I am king like my father, no one<br> may stand so head is higher than mine.<br> So the only way they know how to fight<br> is to hold a long stick in the middle<br> and beat each other<br> on the shins and legs with it.<br> We might just as well stand and kick each<br> other's shins. But he wouldn't even do that.<br> It is a matter that takes much skill.<br> I would have beaten him very badly.<br> I see.<br> But suppose you tell me why it was<br> necessary to fight in the first place?<br> Well, he said I wasn't a man because I told<br> you I was sorry about giving him the book,<br> and a man shouldn't tell a woman he's sorry -<br> not about anything.<br> Oh.<br> Tell me, Your Royal Highness,<br> if your father corrected you about something,<br> would you resent that?<br> He is man. He is very wise.<br> He knows everything.<br> Well, you see, in our country<br> it's possible for me to be almost like a father<br> to Louis, even though I am a woman.<br> And because we love one another very much,<br> he knows I want only what is right for him.<br> And he can accept authority from me<br> just the same as you can from your father.<br> I do not think I would like country<br> in which this was so.<br> But since it is so with us,<br> I see no great need to fight.<br> I think it would be much nicer<br> if you could be friends.<br> Well... he was not coward.<br> He would have tried sticks.<br> Well, all right, then.<br> That's better.<br> We'll see you in school tomorrow.<br> (knocking at door)<br> - (door opens)<br> - (man speaks)<br> Memsahib! Memsahib! It is the end!<br> The end has come. I knew it would come.<br> - Don't be foolish, Beebe. What is it?<br> - Messengers. The king wishes to see you.<br> - What can he want at such a time of night?<br> - I don't know. Help me find my things.<br> Your Majesty.<br> Mem, I think your Moses<br> shall have been a fool.<br> - Moses?<br> - Moses, Moses, Moses.<br> I think he shall have been a fool.<br> Here it stands, written by him:<br> "The world was created in six days."<br> Now, you know and I know<br> it took many centuries to create world.<br> I think he shall have been<br> a fool to have written so.<br> What is your opinion?<br> Do you mean to say that you sent for me<br> at this hour of the night just to ask me that?<br> Yes. What is your opinion?<br> But couldn't you have waited till morning?<br> Mem, you say you wish to help<br> with study, et cetera.<br> Do you wish help, or do not?<br> I'm sorry, Your Majesty.<br> I do want to help if I can.<br> Then what is your opinion<br> of this thing as stated by Moses?<br> It is necessary for me to read all European<br> books to try to understand modern world.<br> And there have been many things written.<br> There have been mountains of things written.<br> And knowledge is buried<br> underneath this mountain.<br> I ask you to consider this is<br> very much reading for one lifetime.<br> And how shall I do this understanding when<br> different English books say different things?<br> Your Majesty, the Bible<br> was not written by men of science.<br> It was written by men of faith.<br> It was their explanation<br> of the miracle of Creation,<br> which is just as great a miracle<br> whether it took six days or many centuries.<br> Science does not contradict the Bible,<br> it has only made us more aware<br> of how great the miracle was.<br> Well, I still think<br> your Moses shall have been a fool.<br> You may go.<br> Moses! The idea!<br> Three o'clock in the morning.<br> Someone ought to tell him a thing or two...<br> (baby cries)<br> (baby continues crying)<br> (speaking Siamese)<br> Lady Tuptim's slave?<br> I am not sorry about the monkey,<br> if that is why you make me stay.<br> It isn't the monkey, Lady Tuptim.<br> I want to ask your help for someone.<br> It's your slave woman, L'Ore. I talked with<br> her.<br> By what right?<br> I can't believe you would deliberately keep<br> her in chains so long. And with a child, too.<br> She tried to run away.<br> She was only trying to go to her husband.<br> He wants to buy her freedom.<br> Isn't there a law in Siam that says<br> a slave must be freed if the money is offered?<br> What right has she to be happy with<br> someone she love while I am shut up here?<br> Let her stay where she is.<br> You can have your law. I have the king.<br> Go and find this out for yourself.<br> - Memcha?<br> - Oh, yes, Your Royal Highness?<br> What is it about this law?<br> Does it mean slaves of king too?<br> Of course. A law is the same for everyone.<br> But I do not understand about law that<br> makes it more important than king. Tell me.<br> I'm sorry. We'll talk about it some other time.<br> Now I must go and see your father.<br> Yes, memcha.<br> - Mem?<br> - Oh, yes, Lady Thiang?<br> Is it not all right for him to ask you things?<br> Things outside the books?<br> Of course. But some other day,<br> when we have more time.<br> I'm sorry, but I must go to the king now.<br> He's really doing very well with his studies.<br> Your Majesty, I've come to you to bring<br> something to your attention. It concerns...<br> Mem, why must you stir up tempest<br> over Lady Tuptim's slave?<br> I have much unpleasantness<br> because of this.<br> Then Lady Tuptim<br> has already told you about it?<br> I do not have time to discuss such matters.<br> In future, do not trouble me with same.<br> They do not interest me. You may go.<br> Surely, Your Majesty, you want to hear all the<br> truth? You've only heard Lady Tuptim's story.<br> - Perhaps this slave isn't important...<br> - Mem, why you stand over my head?<br> I don't understand.<br> Last night, when I invited you<br> to consider Moses, you stood up over me.<br> You do so now,<br> and I cannot stand up all the time.<br> No one's head shall be higher than the king's.<br> It is sign of great disrespect.<br> In future in presence<br> you shall conduct like all other subjects.<br> - You mean on the floor?<br> - All subjects do so.<br> I'm sorry. I shall try my best never to allow<br> my head to be as high as Your Majesty's.<br> But I simply cannot grovel on the floor.<br> You are very stubborn, mem.<br> I do not understand why you must be so.<br> Your Majesty,<br> I couldn't possibly work that way.<br> Surely when we're alone it isn't necessary?<br> No one shall say I am not a reasonable man.<br> I grant you such favour.<br> Thank you, Your Majesty.<br> But... you shall observe care<br> that head shall not be higher than mine.<br> If I shall sit, you shall sit.<br> Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br> - I'll try, Your Majesty.<br> - Very well. You may go.<br> Not until I've said what I came to say.<br> Your Majesty, I think this slave<br> has a right to expect justice from you.<br> And I think it's wrong when the king of Siam<br> upholds his wife when she disobeys the law.<br> I am the law here,<br> as people can discover if not discreet.<br> I'm sorry to hear you say that, Your Majesty,<br> because it goes against everything<br> I thought you wanted for your country.<br> How shall you know<br> what I want for my country?<br> I know you want it to progress. To take its<br> place among the other nations of the world.<br> You made this law yourself.<br> But if you put your own will<br> above the laws you make, you'll fail.<br> Other countries won't trust a nation<br> where a man can put himself above the law.<br> Everything might change<br> with your successor.<br> Siam's word, her treaties with them,<br> would be good only as long as you live.<br> I do not like this talk about "successor".<br> Why must you make entire household<br> in uproar over one slave?<br> I ask you to remember,<br> there are 3,000 women in household.<br> And how shall I do work which is necessary<br> when there is so much uproar?<br> But this is more important, Your Majesty.<br> The progress you want<br> isn't a matter of customs and manners.<br> It's the spirit behind those things.<br> It's... It's recognising<br> that every living person is an individual<br> with the same right<br> to liberty and justice under the law,<br> so that he can make as much<br> as he's willing to make of his life.<br> Your law began to give your people that right,<br> but a law must be the same for everyone -<br> for slave just as much as for king.<br> Consider Her Gracious Majesty Victoria.<br> Queen of the United Kingdom,<br> sovereign of British colonies around globe<br> of human world, and our affectionate sister.<br> - Is she not above the law?<br> - No, Your Majesty.<br> My country may have many faults,<br> but her laws are the same for all.<br> And in the United States, their president, Mr<br> Lincoln, is fighting a war for that principle.<br> This sounds like<br> progress in America pretty bloody.<br> Sometimes you have to fight<br> for what you believe in.<br> Who shall this Mr Lincoln be?<br> Is he king of this United States?<br> - He is their president<br> - What is "president"? I do not understand.<br> It means he was elected. That means he was<br> chosen by the people, by vote, to lead them.<br> I do not think I like this.<br> - Shall he be winning this war?<br> - No one knows, Your Majesty.<br> And how shall he be trained to rule<br> if he is not born to do so?<br> He doesn't rule them. He only sees that the<br> laws they make themselves are carried out.<br> And I believe he studied very hard.<br> He educated himself.<br> This difficult thing,<br> as I know of sad experience.<br> I teach myself English and other language.<br> In this respect,<br> Mr Lincoln and I much alike.<br> He said something about progress once,<br> when he was speaking at a school.<br> He said he was afraid we were inclined to<br> accept as wisdom what is only knowledge,<br> and to accept as progress<br> things that are nothing more than change.<br> He said true progress must bear<br> some relation to man's character.<br> It must have its roots in his heart.<br> I think I like this Mr Lincoln.<br> Why is he not winning war? Has he enough<br> guns, and elephants for transporting same?<br> There are no elephants in America.<br> - No elephants?<br> - No, Your Majesty.<br> Ah. No wonder Mr Lincoln does not win war.<br> - We will write letter to Mr Lincoln.<br> - Now, Your Majesty?<br> Now. When you think?<br> Now always best time.<br> But I wanted to talk to you<br> about the slave woman.<br> Take letter to Mr Lincoln.<br> Yes, Your Majesty.<br> (speaks Siamese) Maha Mongkut,<br> by the blessing of the highest superagency<br> of the whole universe, king of Siam.<br> Sovereign of all interior tributary countries<br> adjacent and around in every direction,<br> et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br> To His Most Respected Excellent...<br> To His Most Respected Excellent Presidency,<br> President of the United States of America.<br> It has occurred to us...<br> "lt has occurred to us..."<br> ..that, should there be several pairs<br> of young male elephants<br> turned loose in forests of America,<br> we are of opinion that after a while they will<br> increase in numbers and inhabitants of...<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - Well?<br> I don't think you mean<br> pairs of male elephants.<br> Do not interrupt.<br> Inhabitants of America will be able to catch<br> them, tame them and use them as beasts of...<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - How can I think such...<br> Only male elephants?<br> Hm. Hm.<br> We on our part will procure<br> young male and female elephants<br> and forward them on to you<br> one or two pairs at a time.<br> Believe me.<br> Yours faithfully, et cetera, et cetera.<br> That is all. You may go.<br> But, Your Majesty, I had hoped<br> you'd talk about the slave woman.<br> That is all. Good day, Mem Owens.<br> Good day, Your Majesty.<br> "True progress shall lie in man's heart."<br> Good morning, Lady Tuptim.<br> I wish to show you something very beautiful.<br> Oh, how lovely.<br> My name mean "pomegranate".<br> He say I am most perfect<br> and fascinating woman in palace.<br> - It's a beautiful gift.<br> - It is worth thousand times price of slave.<br> Then the slave is free?<br> She mean nothing to me now.<br> I do not wish to see her again.<br> It was very generous of you, Lady Tuptim.<br> Perhaps it means<br> much more than you realise.<br> - You did not know this? That she is free?<br> - No.<br> It is strange he did not tell you this.<br> He didn't give me any answer at all. I...<br> Then you did talk to him.<br> And it is you he listened to.<br> If I am not first here, what is left for me?<br> "l appreciate most highly<br> Your Majesty's tender of good offices<br> in forwarding to this government<br> a stock from which a supply of elephants<br> might be raised on our own soil."<br> "But, unfortunately,<br> the present jurisdiction of this government..."<br> "Jurisdiction"?<br> It means "authority".<br> Jurisdiction.<br> Jurisdiction.<br> "..the present jurisdiction of this government<br> no longer reaches<br> those latitudes southernly enough<br> to favour the multiplication of the elephant."<br> "But this nation is warmly grateful for<br> this indication of Your Majesty's friendship,<br> and commends both Your Majesty<br> and the generous people of Siam<br> to the blessings of almighty God."<br> "Your good friend, Abraham Lincoln."<br> Yes, I think I like this Mr Lincoln.<br> Jurisdiction.<br> Jurisdiction.<br> But no elephants.<br> I thought the prince<br> might come to lunch, but he didn't.<br> I think he's lonesome. He doesn't even<br> live with his mother, or talk to her.<br> It's almost as if he didn't have a mother.<br> Why is that?<br> Well, that's just<br> the way things are out here, dear.<br> He hasn't seemed quite so interested<br> in school. Probably something on his mind.<br> - I'll have to find time to talk to him...<br> - Mem... Mem...<br> His Majesty wish<br> that you come to him at once.<br> - But we're just beginning luncheon.<br> - His Majesty say you shall come right now.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Mem, shall it be proper for English dignitary<br> to see some of our women?<br> If Your Majesty were in England, you'd wish<br> to see some of the prettiest women there.<br> But how shall I let him see them like this?<br> No shoes on feet.<br> He will go back and tell Queen Victoria<br> I am barbarian.<br> - Why you not think of that?<br> - Who will tell her?<br> Sir Edward Ramsay.<br> So you, mem, shall choose<br> most beautiful women of harem<br> and dress and educate same<br> in European custom for presentation.<br> Well, when do you wish to have them ready?<br> Five o'clock postmeridian this Saturday.<br> But that's only four days.<br> I can't possibly have them ready in four days.<br> Mem, shall it be possible<br> you are becoming lazy?<br> I'm not lazy at all. I simply can't...<br> Perhaps if mem understood<br> very great importance of occasion...<br> Then why have you not told her this?<br> Mem...<br> Do you think I am barbarian?<br> Of course not, Your Majesty.<br> I hope Sir Edward shall agree with you.<br> Situation for Siam very murky and critical.<br> Oh? What's happened?<br> My agents in Singapore have obtained<br> copies of letters to British government<br> from certain persons wishing<br> to acquire interests in Siam or parts thereof.<br> Such letters describing me as barbarian,<br> and not suitable as ruler of Siam.<br> Wherefore they suggest necessity<br> of establishing protectorate, maybe.<br> That's outrageous!<br> I have met situation by requesting<br> official visit of British representative,<br> who shall see for himself<br> whether or not I am barbarian,<br> and make report of same<br> to your gracious queen.<br> So now you see necessity<br> of making dresses for them.<br> Your Majesty, wouldn't it make<br> a better impression upon Sir Edward<br> if the ladies receive<br> in their own manner and dress?<br> Mem, you are not scientific.<br> He knows we are Siamese.<br> I wish him to see we are also European.<br> So you shall tell me which girls are most like<br> European women for dressing as same.<br> Very well, then.<br> Let me see.<br> - Son Klin, stand still. How can I possibly...<br> - Mem, what kind of men are English men?<br> I have heard they have the evil eye. Terrible<br> blue eyes, mem, that look into the soul.<br> Nonsense. Whoever heard of such a thing?<br> - Oh, dear!<br> - What shall be trouble now?<br> I forgot - they've practically<br> nothing to wear underneath.<br> - Shall you wear something underneath?<br> - Certainly, Your Majesty.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> I am not aware of difference.<br> There is a great difference, Your Majesty,<br> whether you're aware of it or not.<br> All properly dressed European ladies<br> must have undergarments.<br> If I am not aware of difference,<br> how shall Sir Edward be?<br> - But he might notice.<br> - He should not.<br> Mem, what is your opinion?<br> Shall they be all right?<br> I think they're going to look charming.<br> Your Majesty,<br> do you mind if I make a suggestion?<br> What shall this be?<br> I think it's wrong<br> that the only reports about Siam<br> are taken back<br> by sea captains and adventurers.<br> I think that, if you ask him,<br> Sir Edward would help you get officials<br> from England to be here permanently.<br> A consulate, I mean. And such men<br> would tell the truth in their reports.<br> As long as you're having Sir Edward here,<br> why not have other people at the same time?<br> The Dutch and the French, all the Europeans<br> you can reach with invitations.<br> And ask their help in accomplishing<br> the same thing with their countries.<br> - All at same time?<br> - Why not?<br> You want all the other governments<br> to know what you're trying to do here.<br> Too many people. I think you shall<br> proceed with the outer garments, mem.<br> (knocking at door)<br> Oh, dear, I don't think I can stand it.<br> You shall write invitation for dinner<br> for Saturday, six o'clock postmeridian,<br> from list of European people furnished you<br> hereto, and any other desirable you think of.<br> - Submitting names to me firstly.<br> - I thought you said...<br> We are aware gratefully<br> that such idea was suggested by you.<br> But it's idea of doing so with dinner<br> which is important.<br> All slaves shall be given you that you need<br> for cooking and serving. You shall train same.<br> You shall set table yourself, so everything<br> shall be done in best European custom.<br> I'll do everything I can,<br> Your Majesty, but I wish...<br> I shall prove to all that I am not barbarian.<br> You may go.<br> - Shall this be correct for table service?<br> - It's perfect. The loveliest I've ever seen.<br> Oh! Oh, how magnificent!<br> - Suitable for European, maybe?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> (speaks Siamese)<br> - But where are the knives and forks?<br> - Mem? Pure gold, mem.<br> We couldn't possibly use chopsticks<br> with soup and other things I've arranged for.<br> - Mem, have you such things?<br> - Yes, but not nearly enough for...<br> Get knives, forks, spoons - two kinds - from<br> Mem Owens, and have them copied in gold.<br> - But there isn't time, Your Majesty.<br> - They shall work without sleeping.<br> And if it is not done, each man<br> shall be beaten 100 strokes. Tell them this.<br> They shall be ready.<br> - Mem?<br> - Yes, Your Majesty?<br> Shall it be necessary for me<br> to use knife and fork also?<br> It would be desirable, I think, Your Majesty.<br> W-w-would you like me to show you how?<br> That shall not be necessary.<br> I have ability for proper use without lesson.<br> Now, ladies, take your seats, please.<br> All you have to do is sit in your chair<br> until His Majesty makes the presentation,<br> then rise and bow.<br> - Now, do you understand?<br> - (all) Oh, yes, mem.<br> I only hope you do when the time comes.<br> Now, just sit quietly until the presentation.<br> And for goodness' sake,<br> be careful with your dresses.<br> Your Majesty, may I present<br> Mrs Cortright and Mr Cortright.<br> Mr Cortright is the editor<br> of the newspaper in Singapore.<br> Ah.<br> This is newspaper that prints I am spare man.<br> I should like to talk with you, Mr Cortright.<br> Rose-water. Hospitable custom of country.<br> Wherefore have you decorated yourself<br> better than all the rest?<br> - Shall it be for my observation?<br> - Your Majesty...<br> You are fine. Very fine indeed.<br> Your Majesty, may I present Miss Elizabeth<br> McFarlane, who has come out from England.<br> Miss McFarlane's brother<br> is the lieutenant governor in Singapore.<br> - Are you an anecdote, Miss McFarlane?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> You are unmarried woman?<br> An anecdote and an unmarried woman<br> are not the same in English.<br> They are the same.<br> An anecdote is a hereto-untold event<br> of curious interest.<br> An unmarried woman's life is also an untold<br> event, and therefore of curious interest.<br> - I say they are the same.<br> - But...<br> Well, this will make an interesting anecdote<br> for you, Miss McFarlane.<br> - It makes no difference...<br> - Miss McFarlane would like some rose-water.<br> She is very ugly.<br> Herewith shall be list of subjects<br> for you to bring up,<br> because on such subjects I am very brilliant<br> and will make fine impression.<br> - Mem?<br> - Yes, Alak?<br> The napkins, they did not come.<br> I think he will be very angry.<br> It's too late now.<br> We can only pray he won't notice.<br> His Majesty made an interesting point<br> about Moses, when he was reading the Bible.<br> Moses. A very remarkable man.<br> If you remember, he wrote in the Bible...<br> But unfortunately the present jurisdiction<br> of my good friend Mr Lincoln's country<br> did not favour multiplication of the elephant,<br> and we considered the idea was not practical.<br> I was not aware Your Majesty was so familiar<br> with Mr Lincoln and the war in America.<br> Ah. This is point. This is exactly<br> impression I hope you will correct.<br> Court of Siam, through much study thereof,<br> is familiar with happenings<br> on the entire globe of modern world.<br> And now, ladies, gentlemen,<br> I commend to you<br> theatricals for your pleasure.<br> And they shall be<br> of history of kingdom of Siam.<br> A very old and very proud history.<br> (traditional music)<br> Not now, Your Majesty. They've finished.<br> Mem, may I permit them<br> to say I am barbarian without napkins?<br> (knocking at door)<br> Oh, no.<br> Gracious heavens. Now?<br> Wherefore do you not sit down<br> when I am in same position?<br> I have experienced very fatiguing day.<br> So have l, Your Majesty, and it's very late.<br> Very anxious day for me also.<br> I had great fears for success.<br> Are you aware of why I am so hungry?<br> I was sick. Very sick.<br> However, I shall tell you that,<br> on account of conversation with Sir Edward,<br> we are in accord with British government<br> regarding consulates<br> and other matters<br> relating to security of this nation.<br> And very happy thereof.<br> I'm very happy too, Your Majesty. Very.<br> Well, l...<br> I... hope you will accept<br> slight gift of appreciation.<br> For you.<br> Your Majesty, you're very kind.<br> I shall treasure it always.<br> Shall you be hungry?<br> Terribly.<br> Plenty for two.<br> Well, this is odd.<br> Where do you suppose everybody is?<br> - Perhaps they're just late.<br> - Well, it's queer they should all be late.<br> Looks as though<br> something extraordinary's going on.<br> - Perhaps there won't be any school today!<br> - I'll find out what's happening.<br> - May I get my pony and ride?<br> - If you like, dear.<br> But be sure you take Moonshee with you.<br> (door opens)<br> Good day, sir.<br> Lady Thiang,<br> something very strange is going on.<br> I'd be grateful<br> if you could tell me what's happening.<br> Why you concerned with such matters,<br> instead of school?<br> Because whatever it is, it affects my school.<br> And me.<br> - Why you come to me?<br> - Because I thought you would know.<br> - You do not say I told you.<br> - Of course not.<br> - Lady Tuptim has been found.<br> - Tuptim?<br> Didn't you know<br> she had run away from the palace?<br> No.<br> She hasn't been to school<br> for some time, but...<br> How could she<br> possibly get out of the palace?<br> She escaped in robes of novice of the<br> priesthood... which someone gave to her.<br> - Where was she found?<br> - I do not know.<br> All I do know is,<br> when she was brought back to the palace,<br> they brought a young priest with her.<br> - What will this mean, Lady Thiang?<br> - What it has always meant here.<br> - When will she go on trial?<br> - They question her now.<br> You mean her trial has already begun?<br> This is not the same thing.<br> - But she will have a...<br> - I do not say any more.<br> And I think it will be best<br> if you return to teaching of pupils.<br> Thank you, Lady Thiang.<br> The other novices who lived in cell with me<br> never knew I was woman until this morning.<br> They were with me all the time.<br> If they did not know I was woman,<br> how could he know?<br> They will tell you he did not know. Why are<br> they not here? Why do you not ask them?<br> The truth is, this man got you a novice's robe<br> in which you escaped from the palace.<br> You went to his cell and stayed with him<br> there until you were found.<br> Will you confess to this,<br> or must we get it out of him?<br> No, wait!<br> You must believe the truth about him.<br> He had nothing to do with it.<br> He is completely innocent.<br> I went to the monastery<br> because I did not know where else to go.<br> But Phra Palat did not recognise me,<br> not then or ever.<br> Not even though he had known me<br> since he was a boy.<br> I had been betrothed to him by my family<br> before I was sent to palace.<br> After I was sent to palace, he entered the<br> priesthood and put me out of his mind.<br> If he ever thought of me at all,<br> he thought of me as gone forever<br> beyond the wall of inside.<br> He taught us every day.<br> And I grew quiet and happy<br> because I was near him.<br> I no longer wanted to be anything to him.<br> Only to be near him.<br> Only to be near him.<br> A very pretty story, and you told it<br> beautifully.<br> Only no one believes you, of course.<br> Now, let us get back to the beginning.<br> - You went to this man because you love him.<br> - No!<br> - You live in his cell as a woman.<br> - Ask the others. They will tell you the truth.<br> You make him break his holy vows. Confess!<br> I will not. I will not!<br> Stop it! Stop it, do you hear? Stop it!<br> She's telling the truth and you know it.<br> Why don't you call the other novices?<br> You don't want the truth.<br> I shall go to the king<br> and have her taken out of your hands.<br> We will wait.<br> The mem has much to learn.<br> Your Majesty will forgive me.<br> It's a matter of great importance.<br> It's Lady Tuptim, Your Majesty.<br> Is there nothing dishonourable to me<br> that is secret here?<br> Go. All of you, out!<br> It will be better if you understand at once<br> that this matter does not concern you.<br> But it does. It does, dreadfully. Because<br> of her, and even more because of you.<br> Your Majesty, I'm sure if you'd known in the<br> first place she was in love with someone else,<br> you never would have<br> allowed her to be brought here.<br> But now they're trying to make her confess<br> to something that isn't true.<br> Torturing her,<br> without regard to proof or witnesses.<br> You waste your time.<br> But surely you're going to see<br> that they call her witnesses?<br> This shall be my affair.<br> You must, when she's called to trial.<br> I do not wish... to talk more of this.<br> You can't refuse her a trial.<br> There must be a law in this...<br> I am the law!<br> That's what I was afraid of, Your Majesty.<br> I beg you, don't take revenge on this girl.<br> If you do, you'll have thrown away<br> everything you've done.<br> All you built up for your country and yourself,<br> with such labour, against such odds.<br> And you'll never be able to get it back again.<br> How can you have faith yourself<br> in what you're doing?<br> Or ask anyone else to believe in you,<br> or the country you represent,<br> when you know yourself<br> you're only pretending?<br> That you don't give a snap of your fingers<br> for your people or human progress.<br> That it's a lie. Something to cover up<br> caprice and passion and self-indulgence.<br> You go too far.<br> This girl hurt your vanity, that's all.<br> You don't love her.<br> She didn't hurt your heart. You haven't<br> a heart. You've never loved anyone.<br> You are a barbarian.<br> You'll never change.<br> You'll be a barbarian as long as you live.<br> Mem...<br> how shall you like<br> if I make you watch what I shall do?<br> He has not sinned!<br> He did no wrong to anyone!<br> We have not sinned!<br> We have not sinned!<br> (Tuptim screaming in agony)<br> - Goodbye, memcha.<br> - Goodbye, Prince Sawat.<br> - Goodbye, memcha.<br> - Goodbye, Princess Phatana.<br> - Goodbye, memcha.<br> - Goodbye, Princess Sumawa.<br> - Goodbye, memcha.<br> - Goodbye, Princess Mowana.<br> - Where's Prince Chulalongkorn?<br> - He would not come.<br> - Memcha?<br> - Princess?<br> I will always feel so unhappy,<br> thinking of you<br> being among all those English people.<br> I shan't ever forget you, Princess.<br> Goodbye.<br> I guess that's all.<br> You go on, Mother.<br> Why? What are you going to do, Louis?<br> I rather thought<br> I'd like to say goodbye to the prince.<br> Oh.<br> It's odd he wasn't here today.<br> Well, he's funny.<br> All right, dear, but don't be too long.<br> Oh.<br> - Good day, sir.<br> - Good day.<br> We are wishing<br> to say something to you, mem.<br> Oh?<br> Be seated, please.<br> Shall you be ready?<br> (giggles nervously)<br> "Dear friend and teacher."<br> "My goodness gracious, do not go away."<br> "We are in great need of you."<br> "We are like one blind."<br> "Do not let us fall down in darkness,<br> but continue good<br> and sincere concern for us<br> and lead us in the right road."<br> "Your loving pupils."<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> You can't imagine...<br> You can't imag...<br> Lady Thiang...<br> I came here because l...<br> I've seen very little of you lately.<br> Somehow I have a feeling<br> you've been avoiding me.<br> I should hate to leave like that.<br> I have a sense of having failed here, but...<br> I'd hoped that we had become<br> rather special friends.<br> If there's any reason why...<br> Does the mem want me<br> to say she has not failed?<br> Or does she wish me to speak truth?<br> Why, the truth, of course.<br> This is maybe not good room<br> for mem to speak about her failure.<br> Has she ever observed my wallpaper?<br> - It's very beautiful.<br> - But you have not really looked at it.<br> It tells a story,<br> for anyone with the eyes to see.<br> I had it painted.<br> That straight young tree<br> is like unto me when I am young<br> and became first wife to my lord,<br> who is the great tree there.<br> I am happy, and you can see<br> that there are flowers all around.<br> They are the happiness<br> that grows in our shadow.<br> But here, other trees grow up<br> between me and my lord.<br> That is custom - for king to take many wives.<br> And here, my lord the king, the great tree,<br> grows very fast, very high,<br> trying to touch stars.<br> But the branches are bare,<br> not green with leaves<br> to make kind shadow from the sun.<br> See? The flowers are almost gone.<br> And the small tree, which is me,<br> droops and withers.<br> I cannot help him.<br> And here...<br> I see that beside me,<br> very small tree is growing.<br> This is my son,<br> the prince who shall be king.<br> See that the ground is all bare now.<br> The sun is very cruel.<br> I try to shelter him,<br> but I am very small,<br> because I am only woman.<br> I try, but I do not know if I can do this.<br> - But you haven't finished it.<br> - No.<br> I did not know what the end shall be.<br> But I know now, and I do not wish to paint it.<br> I cannot help him.<br> This tree will not be better than the other one.<br> And this shall be your fault,<br> Mem Owens.<br> You should have helped him.<br> That is what I hoped for.<br> He wished for such love as your son has.<br> That is what he needed.<br> I watch him.<br> He could have grown gentle and kind.<br> And in this is happiness, not in lessons.<br> All this you could have given him,<br> but I could not.<br> He is the one you fail.<br> And I shall remember you for this failure<br> every time I look at my son,<br> as long as I shall live.<br> (sobbing)<br> Memsahib! Memsahib!<br> Only infidels would send gifts<br> at a time like this, memsahib.<br> They should be sold,<br> and this I will undertake for you.<br> Yes, we'll see, Moonshee.<br> - Good day, mem.<br> - Your Excellency.<br> You're better today, mem?<br> Much better.<br> Won't you sit down, Excellency?<br> Not today, mem. I'm here officially today.<br> I have something I'm ordered to read to you.<br> Are you prepared for listening, mem?<br> Yes.<br> "The unforeseen misfortune<br> of mournful event of death<br> of said affectionate boy<br> has caused great sorrow<br> to His Majesty and to royal family,<br> since this boy was beloved by all<br> as if member of said family."<br> "But as sign of regret<br> that events of such sorrowful nature<br> must be arriving to those<br> deserving of better happiness,<br> as day of mourning for entire country,<br> to observe same with fireworks and other<br> ceremony just as for member of royal family."<br> "Also, from this day,<br> Mem Anna Owens shall bear title<br> of Lady Kroo Yai of Kingdom of Siam,<br> as mark of sad respect of said nation."<br> "Maha Mongkut, king of Siam."<br> Took him a long time to write it, mem.<br> He wrote it many times.<br> It was very kind of him.<br> Mem...<br> please, try and understand.<br> He's trying to say in this letter<br> that he is sorry.<br> Not only about your son,<br> but about the woman.<br> That he was wrong.<br> That you spoke truth to him.<br> That nothing is any better for it.<br> That is very much for him to say, mem.<br> It is first time that he shall have tried<br> to say that he is sorry to any person.<br> Please thank him for me.<br> Memsahib, is this to be put up with?<br> Is it to be endured?<br> For Louis sahib - fireworks?<br> They're holding religious services too,<br> if you listen.<br> Then listen.<br> (man chanting prayers in distance)<br> Mem.<br> - You may go.<br> - Yes, memcha.<br> - Memcha...<br> - Your Royal Highness.<br> I came...<br> I wanted to ask...<br> Do you... remember this?<br> When we said goodbye to each other,<br> he gave it to me.<br> I think that you shall maybe want it back.<br> No.<br> It was Louis's, to give to whom he pleased.<br> - You think that I may keep it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Mem?<br> - Yes, Your Royal Highness?<br> I did not give Nar Lek...<br> That is what I call Louis.<br> I did not give him anything, and there is<br> something I would have given to him, I think.<br> It is white. Not all white, of course,<br> but it is whiter than most.<br> And it is mine.<br> There are not many things that are mine.<br> Not really. I mean, to give.<br> So if you wouldn't mind taking it,<br> maybe... maybe it would be like...<br> - What is it?<br> - My elephant.<br> It's almost white, and...<br> You liked Louis, didn't you?<br> Well, he gave me the knife,<br> and he'd like it if you had<br> something that could take care of you.<br> I think he's very strong, the elephant,<br> and I like him very much.<br> But... if you gave me this strong, gentle<br> elephant, who's going to look after you?<br> You're growing so fast,<br> your wrists are sticking out of your jacket.<br> - Somebody really ought to look after you.<br> - Mem... Mem...<br> You sent for me, Your Majesty?<br> Yes, l... I sent for you.<br> What is it, Your Majesty?<br> I...<br> Mem, doctors I send say you do not<br> take medicine for sleeping as prescribed.<br> Resting shall be necessary. I do not know<br> why you shall be so strong-headed in this.<br> I'm sorry. I'm afraid I haven't...<br> I want Your Majesty to know<br> that I'm very grateful<br> for the kind things you've done since...<br> since my boy's death.<br> Such things I do not important.<br> - Is that all, Your Majesty?<br> - No.<br> This is not all.<br> I have other matter to talk with you.<br> Mem, I become every day<br> more behind with work,<br> which every day becomes more difficult,<br> thus making for me much confusion<br> and weariness, et cetera.<br> For such instance,<br> it shall be important to know -<br> why shall geographies say<br> this is absolute monarchy?<br> How shall I be absolute if, when I wish<br> something to be so, it doesn't happen,<br> despite my absolute will<br> to the contrary? Geographies!<br> What is opinion, mem?<br> I don't know. I...<br> Never mind. Is difficult question.<br> I am also much worried whether I shall<br> send delegate, suitable display, et cetera<br> to great exhibition in Paris. What is opinion?<br> It sounds like an admirable idea,<br> Your Majesty.<br> I think you shall not give opinion<br> so quickly, without thinking.<br> Maybe French have murky reason<br> for suggesting such exhibit.<br> Why you not think of this?<br> It would be much help if you would examine<br> correspondence for such murky propositions.<br> This I am too burdened to do myself,<br> and there is no one else to be trusted.<br> This shall be much important, mem.<br> What shall answer be?<br> I can't, Your Majesty.<br> Mem, shall you be forgetting<br> that work is always best remedy?<br> I know, but I can't. I can't take<br> any more letters or give any more advice.<br> I'd like to, but I can't.<br> What shall you be doing, then?<br> You do not go away?<br> I don't know, l...<br> I haven't been able to think. I...<br> I'd like to keep on with my school, I think.<br> I've nowhere else... I...<br> I'd like to keep on with my school.<br> But, Mem, only schoolteaching?<br> I think that also...<br> It's the children I want.<br> It's the children. (sobs)<br> Very well, mem.<br> I think if you do other work such as letters,<br> such arrangement would contemplate<br> raise in salary, but...<br> Very well, mem.<br> That will be all for today.<br> And for tomorrow you need not prepare<br> the lesson in geography.<br> I find His Majesty has done away<br> with the geographies we had,<br> so we'll have to wait till new books arrive.<br> That's all.

Very ill.<br> He asked for us.<br> But we must wait again.<br> Maybe for last time.<br> (man chanting prayers)<br> Mem!<br> Yes, Your Majesty?<br> Wherefore... have you not<br> arrived more quickly?<br> I wish to talk to you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<br> Sit down, mem.<br> - You mustn't talk now, Your Majesty.<br> - I shall talk, I say.<br> There is not much time. I die, mem.<br> No!<br> Do not say foolish things.<br> I know if I die or do not die.<br> You shouldn't be here.<br> Can't we move you to your room?<br> No. I wish to remain here,<br> in room with knowledge.<br> I have finished thinking about dying.<br> I think of many other things<br> while I am lying here.<br> I think of things... I should have said to you.<br> I mean...<br> when I think maybe I do not see you again, l...<br> I write down these things.<br> I think maybe it will be better<br> he shall read them.<br> Shall you be listening, old friend?<br> There shall be words for you too.<br> I'm listening, Toongramon.<br> "l think there shall not be much importance<br> that a man shall die,<br> for it is time that does<br> all true things, not man."<br> "Then I think it shall be important to consider<br> those who have been of most help."<br> Ah! Words, words.<br> I wish to say...<br> you...<br> You have spoken truth to me, always.<br> Even when I do not wish to hear it, you have<br> always courage to say when I am wrong.<br> You have set feet of children<br> on excellent path of learning,<br> and are therefore<br> most affectionately thought of by same.<br> More so... than regular parents,<br> including self.<br> So that if some shall grow<br> better than parents...<br> it shall be your doing.<br> And as reward for this,<br> what shall I have done?<br> I have often lost my temper on you.<br> I have never spoken gratitude of feeling.<br> I haven't even given promised raise in salary.<br> I do not wish to die without having said that...<br> gratitude...<br> and...<br> and large respect,<br> and...<br> confidence...<br> on you,<br> which shall have become larger every day.<br> But, mem,<br> if I haven't graciously said<br> this gratitude before,<br> you must remember<br> you have been very difficult woman.<br> Much more difficult than... than generality.<br> Generality.<br> That's a good word.<br> It means...<br> It means...<br> Never mind.<br> True progress...<br> shall lie...<br> Et cetera,<br> et cetera,<br> et cetera.<br> He tried so hard. No one will ever know.<br> It was so hard to let anyone help him.<br> He wanted to,<br> but he couldn't.<br> He was like a little boy sometimes.<br> You remember about the forks and knives.<br> And he was sick that night, he cared so much.<br> They didn't know he cared like that.<br> Nobody understood.<br> Not really.<br> It seems a long time ago,<br> I tried to make you understand this man.<br> I do not think I said it half so well.<br> What happens now?<br> All his work, and...?<br> I think now the young prince<br> will have much need of you.<br> It was meant<br> that you shall stay and help him, mem.<br> Let this, our first message to our people,<br> be proclaimed.<br> And not as if we were doing<br> a great and lordly thing,<br> but only what is right and fitting.<br> But from this hour, the ancient national<br> custom of obeisance on hands and knees<br> is abolished.<br> And all men shall stand before the king,<br> and before one another,<br> as men should do.<br> And let it be the spirit of this proclamation<br> that this shall be the first of many changes<br> which we hope to bring about<br> as soon as they are possible.<br> As I believe my father, the late king,<br> would wish us to do.<br> And as I have learned<br> it is right and necessary to do<br> if we are to live and work together<br> in liking and respect for one another,<br> as we must do<br> if we are to work together<br> for the good of our country.<br> English SDH<br>
