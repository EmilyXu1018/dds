                        - What is the verdict?<br> - Guilty, Your Grace.<br> All of them?<br> Guilty.<br> Farewell, farewell<br> My pleasure past<br> Welcome my present pain<br> Welcome the torment in my heart<br> To see my love again<br> Warrant for the execution of<br> Sir Henry Norris for adultery with Annee,<br> Queen of England.<br> For the execution of Mark Smeaton<br> for the treason of adultery with Annee,<br> Queen of England.<br> To the Lieutenant Governor of the Tower<br> of London a warrant for the execution...<br> ...of Annee, Queen of England.<br> For adultery and treason.<br> To be burned or beheaded<br> at the King's pleasure.<br> Annee, Queen of England.<br> My wife.<br> My wife, Cromwell.<br> She has borne you a useless daughter<br> and a dead son.<br> When we married she promised me a son.<br> I must have a son to rule<br> when I am dead.<br> God guided the conscience<br> and answered prayers of the King.<br> - He will not let you condemn unjustly.<br> - Then why do I hesitate?<br> Is the hesitation from God?<br> Or is He telling me you must die, you<br> who found evidence and arranged trial?<br> I care only that the King rules<br> absolutely.<br> The Queen despised her marriage<br> and indulged her carnal lust.<br> Betrayed me?<br> Did she, Cromwell? Did she?<br> Your Grace, the Queen betrayed you<br> and stands condemned.<br> The warrant is before you.<br> If she betrayed me, she must die.<br> If I am to rule, keep my sanity,<br> and hold England off the rocks,<br> and as you say, God would not<br> allow me to condemn unjustly.<br> If I question that, I question<br> my whole life and all Ive done.<br> At times, I do question it.<br> Write it down.<br> Write down Henry Rex and it's done.<br> Ive condemned men before,<br> nobles and peasants, why not a queen?<br> She struck down a few herself<br> or driven me to do it for her.<br> It's only...<br> Its only that when you've<br> held a woman in your arms<br> and longed for her when she's away,<br> suffered with her<br> and waited with her<br> for the outcome of the child bed...<br> You promised me a son.<br> Annee.<br> Annee!<br> She's new.<br> Boleyn's youngest daughter.<br> Newly returned from the French court.<br> Do you like her, Kate?<br> Shall we keep her here at court<br> to cheer you?<br> Whatever you command, My Lord.<br> And suppose I command you<br> to give me a son?<br> - Would to God I could, Henry.<br> - Amen.<br> But you cAnneot, because our marriage<br> is accursed in heaven and hell, madam.<br> Play on. Play on.<br> The Queen wishes it and I command it.<br> Play!<br> When I call for it,<br> tell the musicians to play my galliard.<br> And see to it, More,<br> that there is no argument.<br> My Lord Bishop.<br> Your Majesty.<br> - If it please Your Grace...<br> - No politics, Wolsey.<br> Go and commune with the devil<br> while I dance.<br> No, just a simple domestic matter.<br> A wedding.<br> Any man who marries<br> when he can be free is a fool.<br> Here. Here is the couple.<br> Young Percy, Northumberland's son.<br> He's a member of my household.<br> And Annee Boleyn.<br> Their parents agreed.<br> Have they your permission to marry?<br> - Ive told them...<br> - No.<br> - "No", did Your Grace say?<br> - No.<br> - But it is a love match.<br> - Un-match them, Wolsey, unmatch them.<br> And send the Boleyns, father,<br> mother, son and eldest daughter,<br> back to their castle in Kent,<br> and send Annee with them tonight.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Im bored, Wolsey.<br> Im bored with the court.<br> Bored with my Spanish cow.<br> I shall go hunting<br> in the beautiful country of Kent.<br> - Your Grace.<br> - No ceremony.<br> I have a mind to put you all to shame.<br> You're short of breath.<br> - A misspent life, sir.<br> - No doubt.<br> Brereton, you keep time like a deaf man.<br> - Your Grace has learned my secret.<br> - Norfolk, sit by the fire at your age.<br> - Better to lie by it, Your Grace.<br> - Yes, but with whom?<br> Percy, you have feet of lead,<br> a northern clodhopper.<br> With your permission,<br> Mistress Annee, will you teach the King<br> how they dance at the court of France?<br> There is nothing France<br> can teach England, Your Majesty.<br> Well said.<br> Well said.<br> The galliard. Play.<br> My Lord?<br> Tell Boleyn<br> I wish to speak to him privately.<br> - Yes, My Lord.<br> - And then prepare for a journey.<br> - A journey?<br> - Yes.<br> For where the dove is<br> the hawk will not be far behind.<br> To Hever Castle in Kent.<br> Mary, it must be said,<br> the King wishes to see me alone.<br> He asked not to see me?<br> Not directly.<br> That could mean he's finished with me.<br> Has he? Tell me the truth.<br> One never gets used to these things.<br> There is always a hell to go through.<br> When a girl gives herself<br> so completely...<br> You know why I gave myself to the King.<br> Since I opened my bedroom door to him,<br> you've lived well by it.<br> Steward of Tonbridge and Penshurst.<br> Sheriff of Bradsted. Viscount.<br> And now King's Treasurer.<br> You don't want to lose those revenues,<br> do you, Father?<br> Mary, I have always loved you.<br> All those things are true.<br> The King was generous to me<br> because you were generous to him.<br> But you're a fool because you gave him<br> everything and asked for nothing.<br> What His Majesty is denied,<br> he goes mad to obtain.<br> What he gets freely, he despises.<br> You have lost him.<br> I can't help you.<br> Go now and cause no trouble.<br> I will not have you<br> put the rest of us at risk.<br> - What ails you?<br> - Ask our beloved father.<br> Father, the Lord Cardinal is here.<br> - Boleyn. I see you've told the lady.<br> - Yes, My Lord.<br> - And Annee?<br> - No.<br> - Why not? The King is almost here.<br> - Like you, I encouraged her with Percy.<br> It never entered my head<br> that the King would look at her.<br> My Lord, the King is here.<br> - There is no time...<br> - Leave the girl to me.<br> Tell the King what rubbish you please,<br> but give me time.<br> As for young Percy,<br> he'll do as I bid him.<br> Whoa, boy.<br> Your Majesty.<br> Only your King, Thomas.<br> No ceremony. Only your Henry.<br> This is a great honour.<br> From Harry Percy?<br> Where is Annee, Lady Elizabeth?<br> I found this in her room.<br> - How is the Vicar of Hell this morning?<br> - Warm enough, Your Majesty.<br> To be active on the King's business<br> generates a certain heat.<br> Yes, with your feet<br> on the devil's fender<br> and your buttocks toasting<br> at God's altar.<br> - Has he spoken to you?<br> - He has, Your Grace.<br> Good. Good.<br> And when may I smell this<br> pretty posy of yours?<br> If you mean Annee, sir,<br> she is still at her mirror.<br> A new dress, nervous fingers. If you<br> could give her half an hour, perhaps?<br> - We have this whole day, Thomas.<br> - Ive a new pack of hounds<br> and there's a clump of deer<br> in the meadow.<br> - We'll see one, hunt the other.<br> - Good hunting.<br> - You'll not be with us?<br> - It appears there are two poor souls<br> who seek religious comfort.<br> I must go.<br> Indeed, My Lord Cardinal, indeed.<br> God's work must come first.<br> And, who knows, there may be<br> a little worldly profit attached.<br> Oh, Your Majesty...<br> Find them, bring them to me.<br> Thomas, a private word with you<br> before I meet Annee.<br> Yes, Your Grace?<br> There is always a temptation<br> for a man in my position<br> to regard the nation as his own trough<br> and to eat from one end to the other.<br> - Not Your Grace.<br> - Why not? Who can say no to me?<br> Except God, and He does, Thomas.<br> I kneel. I pray. He answers.<br> But can that be seen to be so?<br> Why else would His Holiness the Pope<br> have named you Defender of the Faith?<br> True. True.<br> I am a religious man.<br> I want to do right by God<br> and the Church,<br> and the people and myself,<br> and you, Thomas.<br> Do you follow?<br> That's a swathe of folk to satisfy,<br> if it includes God, Your Grace.<br> It includes your two daughters, Thomas.<br> - Are they friends?<br> - Yes.<br> And do they exchange confidences,<br> do you think?<br> Do they whisper together at night<br> secrets about me, perhaps?<br> Who knows, Your Grace?<br> The one you have had,<br> the other you desire.<br> Will Annee have me, and for myself?<br> - I want an honest answer.<br> - She's no fool, My Lord.<br> Good. Good.<br> What I do is God's will<br> and my prayer always is<br> that He will allow no thought<br> to enter my heart or mind<br> that is not His will.<br> He has...<br> He has never failed me, Thomas.<br> But Your Majesty realizes<br> this might seem as...<br> As what?<br> As an excuse to do as you please,<br> to eat the trough dry.<br> Im the King of England.<br> When I pray, God answers.<br> Yes, Your Grace.<br> And let no man dare question that.<br> Or woman.<br> Again.<br> - Im angry with myself.<br> - Why?<br> Well, think of the years I spent<br> at the French court.<br> I was surrounded by gallant,<br> captivating, exquisite French courtiers<br> and I loved none of them.<br> No sooner do I return<br> than I fall in love with a...<br> - "Clodhopper", said His Majesty.<br> - He was right.<br> No mAnneers, can't dance,<br> can't sing, can't...<br> - Can put his arms around you.<br> - Not as well as Ive known it done.<br> But they are the arms I want,<br> for some God knows what reason.<br> I love your awkwardness.<br> But if we love enough to marry,<br> we must keep nothing back.<br> So?<br> - Are we to bed together? Before?<br> - If you like.<br> Kiss me.<br> Are you a virgin?<br> - Im a man.<br> - I know, but are you a virgin?<br> When we bed together,<br> shall I be your first?<br> - I...<br> - Speak out.<br> Well, Ill say it frankly<br> as they do in France.<br> In England we make muddy mysteries<br> of such things as if they were crimes.<br> We don't come out of a rainbow at 17<br> and there's no use pretending we do.<br> You may ask me whatever you like.<br> - Are you a virgin?<br> - No.<br> - In France?<br> - Yes. And long before.<br> When I was little,<br> I was playing with a boy<br> and he threw me down...<br> The King refuses you<br> permission to marry.<br> - But...<br> - Why? Why, My Lord?<br> Marriages of the nobility<br> are affairs of State.<br> I was wrong to encourage you.<br> The King wishes you to marry<br> a daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.<br> I am pledged to Annee.<br> It is a good match.<br> I brought you to court. You're a member<br> of my household. You will obey.<br> The world knew we meant to marry.<br> Nothing was said against it.<br> You've heard the King's pleasure<br> against it.<br> A half grown steer and a leggy girl<br> will not be allowed<br> to overturn the policies of State.<br> Why was nothing said?<br> Her father, my father,<br> and you, My Lord Cardinal,<br> who knows the King's business<br> better than himself.<br> Be silent!<br> You will obey<br> or your estates will be forfeit.<br> If you show further disloyalty,<br> it's doubtful how long you'll live.<br> The Duke of Buckingham<br> lost his head for less. Now go.<br> You must go.<br> Kiss me, then.<br> Don't touch her.<br> - Be careful of yourself.<br> - I will, for you.<br> My Lord, I love him truly<br> and we are pledged to each other.<br> If you force him to marry elsewhere,<br> although I am only a girl,<br> you'll know you have an enemy.<br> Madam, you do me wrong.<br> I have no spleen against you,<br> I am only a messenger.<br> Messenger? Who has chosen for me?<br> When Henry of England<br> turns his eyes on a girl,<br> she can hardly look away.<br> - The King has asked for me?<br> - He has.<br> And sent you to me?<br> It is sometimes my duty<br> to anticipate his desires.<br> Even in carnal matters,<br> My Lord Cardinal?<br> We have had the King in the bosom<br> of this family for some years.<br> My sister Mary is with child by him<br> and of no further use.<br> I shall not go the way of my sister.<br> You would be wise to anticipate<br> my answer<br> and spare His Majesty any Anneoyance.<br> I will not be a mistress of the King<br> even with the blessing<br> of a prince of the Church.<br> - Good sport in Boleyn's woods.<br> - And in his bowers.<br> I heard you, Norris.<br> Well, you two, tell me,<br> man to man, all kingship aside,<br> - what's the best way to win a maid?<br> - A maid?<br> I couldn't swear to it medically,<br> but it's young and it's wild.<br> My skills are not for<br> the grade of female you seek.<br> Im more successful with waiting women.<br> Don't be modest.<br> Ive followed your spoor so close<br> there was scarce time<br> to close the window you left by<br> or change perfumes<br> to put me off the scent.<br> Speak on, your lure,<br> your most seductive.<br> - You'll not be offended?<br> - Ill be offended if you hold back.<br> If you truly want her, make her believe<br> that you are potent only with her.<br> Pretend that you've tried with others.<br> Gone to bed, kissed hotly,<br> but hung embarrassed and unable.<br> But with her you rouse up.<br> You're a man again.<br> They can't resist that.<br> They open like...<br> Never mind the simile.<br> Yes. What a game. What a ploy.<br> Dare I ask, has Your Grace<br> ever been refused by a wench?<br> Who? I? Refused? Why, never.<br> When Ive wanted them, Ive had them.<br> When Ive had a wench, Im cured.<br> That's general, isn't it?<br> Your Grace, can you all leave talking<br> of virgins to look at the venison?<br> Yes, yes. Come, come.<br> Next to the haunch of a virgin,<br> there's nothing<br> like a haunch of venison.<br> Do you also offer me up<br> to this royal bull?<br> You, my father?<br> And you, my mother?<br> - Lower your voice!<br> - Do you know what it is to be in love?<br> - I love Harry Percy and will marry him.<br> - You'll have us all dead or disgraced.<br> Lower your voice.<br> The royal bull can't force you.<br> Brother, I must fight. I must.<br> Do you know what it means<br> when a king asks for you?<br> I can ask my pregnant<br> and foolish sister.<br> Turn him away and we can say farewell<br> to all we've worked for.<br> If our parents had not taken advantage<br> what would've become of us?<br> If we lose favour, we lose everything.<br> Then say goodbye to it all,<br> for I will not take the King to my bed!<br> Your Majesty.<br> I was so anxious to see you, madam,<br> I ran ahead.<br> Have you been faithful to me<br> or lying about with this husband?<br> Remarkable women you breed, you Howards.<br> [laughter]<br> Norfolk, greet your sister.<br> Ive brought your brother<br> to make sure I was welcome.<br> George, you should have hunted with us<br> and not stayed at home with the ladies.<br> Nan.<br> - Give me a kiss.<br> - Yes, Your Majesty.<br> And now on the lips, sweet Nan.<br> Ive been taking medicines for a cold.<br> My breath is foul, Your Grace.<br> Your health is very dear to us.<br> You must needs keep well.<br> We live all too brief a span.<br> What little we have<br> should not be wasted.<br> Well, there's no trace of medicine<br> or fever on these sweet lips.<br> The surprise of Your Majesty's visit<br> must have cured me.<br> Wonderful. I shall continue the cure.<br> Shall I dismiss the chaperones?<br> - By your leave.<br> - Yes, by your leave.<br> Yes, without your leave.<br> Off. Out. All of you, go.<br> Companions, brothers.<br> Lawyer. Go.<br> Annee, you see before you<br> not the King, but a poor fellow<br> as uncertain, as eager,<br> as hopeful, as afraid<br> as any man that ever fell in love.<br> I see the King.<br> Believe me, all kingship on one side.<br> Women give love to the King<br> like paying taxes.<br> I wish to be loved for myself.<br> Well, as you say you're not the King,<br> but only a poor, uncertain,<br> eager, hopeful fellow.<br> Could you tell me why the King sent an<br> old Church pander to give me my orders?<br> - Pander?<br> - The Lord Cardinal Wolsey.<br> Oh. Did he speak clumsily?<br> No, Your Grace.<br> He spoke to the point.<br> What the King wants, he will have.<br> No, Annee. Its quite the reverse.<br> What you want, you shall have.<br> - If I have you first.<br> - Not against your will.<br> - Not?<br> - Never.<br> Ill earn your love<br> and then your bed.<br> Tell me what things you want.<br> Prove me.<br> There is one thing I want.<br> I want something that has gone.<br> You shall have it.<br> Now walk with me, talk with me.<br> I love your sweet voice,<br> your company and your bold spirit.<br> Tell me, dare I ask it?<br> Is there anything about me<br> that you love?<br> No.<br> My God.<br> You asked not to be treated<br> like the King.<br> I would have lied to the King.<br> No one has ever talked to me<br> like that before.<br> My sweet voice will not lie to you.<br> But in time, Nan,<br> you'll grow to love me.<br> Anything is possible.<br> With us everything is possible.<br> That's settled. I can return to London.<br> - You, Cromwell, will remain here.<br> - Here, My Lord?<br> To keep me informed.<br> Tell My Lord of Suffolk that we shall<br> entertain no more such petitions.<br> Show that to Sir Thomas More,<br> that's his province.<br> Ah, Thomas.<br> You smell of horse sweat.<br> His Majesty has sent me to inform you,<br> My Lord, that the...<br> ...entertainment at Hever suits him<br> well, and he intends to remain.<br> Excellent. No, tell Lovell<br> his request is denied.<br> That witch has been leading him<br> a dance for two weeks.<br> She'll go the way of all the rest.<br> Granted.<br> The King should be attending to matters<br> of State, not pursuing a reluctant girl.<br> If he wants her, he should take her.<br> What is Sir Thomas More's opinion<br> about that?<br> Master Cromwell,<br> when you counsel the King<br> tell him what he ought to do,<br> but never what he is able to do.<br> If he knew his real strength, it<br> would be hard for any man to rule him.<br> - He ought to leave Hever.<br> - Let sleeping kings lie, Thomas,<br> and we'll see to the government<br> of the country.<br> Nan, it's a cruel thing to be<br> near a woman day after day,<br> to touch her when you wanted to,<br> to have her company when you asked it<br> and to have no response.<br> To burn with love as I do for you<br> and be denied any pleasure<br> in your cool company.<br> It is a cruel thing, Nan,<br> to be denied love.<br> The same cruel thing has happened to me.<br> Ive fallen in love.<br> - Nan!<br> - But not with you.<br> My God. I got it right in the face<br> that time. Percy, is it?<br> You know.<br> You had Wolsey send him away.<br> - That blundering...<br> - I mean to marry him.<br> - Never!<br> - But not as my sister is married.<br> He won't be a complacent husband<br> and I shall not be accessible to you.<br> All wives are accessible.<br> Any husband can be placated.<br> Then you have nothing to fear.<br> Let me marry him.<br> No! I want you all to myself!<br> Nan. Nan.<br> If you give yourself to me<br> this whole kingdom will turn around you.<br> Whatever you wanted for anyone.<br> knighthoods, revenues,<br> you shall dispose of them<br> exactly as you please.<br> And be thrown out in the end? What great<br> revenues does my sister dispose of?<br> Well, Mary asked for nothing.<br> I won't bargain. Ask for what you want.<br> My freedom. To marry whom I love.<br> Never.<br> Ive heard what your courtiers say<br> and Ive seen what you are.<br> You're spoiled and vengeful<br> and bloody.<br> Your poetry is sour<br> and your music is worse.<br> You make love as you eat, with<br> a good deal of noise and no subtlety.<br> This is not safe.<br> Yes, Ive been told it's not safe<br> for any of us to say no to our King.<br> That put on, kindly,<br> hail-fellow-well-met of yours.<br> My father's house will be pulled down,<br> and Northumberland's too, they tell me.<br> Well, pull them down, Your Majesty,<br> you are what I said.<br> There is no better way to make an end<br> than to raise anger in me.<br> I thank you for that. You made<br> a fool of me! And Im well out of it!<br> Your Grace!<br> - You will not harm Harry Percy?<br> - Ill try not.<br> Vengeful and bloody as I am,<br> Ill try not!<br> [grunts]<br> - Where are you from?<br> - Northumberland.<br> - Ive a message for the Lady Annee.<br> - You better rest. Give me the letter.<br> - Give it to no one but the Lady Annee.<br> - All right.<br> Harry Percy is married.<br> "Annee, my love, forgive me".<br> - The King did this.<br> - Not the King, Wolsey.<br> See here.<br> ''I would have held out. But for your<br> safety, dearest Annee, I had to marry.''<br> That would be Wolsey's threat, that you<br> would suffer if Percy remained defiant.<br> God, I can't believe it.<br> The pain is so great, I want to die.<br> Pain goes, my child.<br> Few of us marry where our hearts lie.<br> [shouting, cheering]<br> Damn all entertainment<br> and damn all women!<br> Why must I want the one woman<br> who doesn't want me?<br> Ill see her!<br> Elizabeth.<br> For God's sake make her hurry. When the<br> King is hungry he's in an evil temper.<br> Ill see to this.<br> Will. Let's see what the lady Elizabeth<br> has decided.<br> - He's never returned to a woman.<br> - Lucky for all of us and your child.<br> - Henry was generous with his children.<br> - Learn from me, Nan.<br> Lock up your heart,<br> never surrender completely.<br> I shall not surrender myself at all.<br> The moment you're conquered<br> he'll walk away.<br> That's enough!<br> I hate him only a little less<br> than I hate Wolsey.<br> - Ready? Are we ready?<br> - Quite ready, Father.<br> Farewell, farewell<br> My pleasure past<br> Welcome my present pain<br> Welcome the torment In my heart<br> To see my love again<br> Alone, alone<br> I longed for her<br> While mistresses forsaking<br> Now must I tell my hopes and fear<br> Of love In her awaking<br> Bravo, Your Majesty! Bravo!<br> Bravo, Majesty.<br> No other king can write as you do,<br> Your Majesty.<br> That cheers me, Elizabeth.<br> Someone, I forget whom,<br> said once that my music was sour<br> and my poetry worse.<br> That caused me great anguish. True verse<br> and music grow from suffering.<br> I heard it in my mind<br> when I woke from a troubled sleep.<br> I wrote it down without a correction.<br> It sings what is truly in my heart.<br> If some young man wrote this song<br> for you, Annee, what would you say of it?<br> I would ask him how his wife liked it,<br> Your Grace.<br> You shall dance to my tune, mistress.<br> The Basse dance I composed.<br> Play. Be merry. Dance.<br> Annee, why do you taunt me?<br> Percy is married, Your Majesty.<br> - None of my doing.<br> - I see.<br> Wolsey is King of England, is he?<br> That's enough. I am the King.<br> If you dare to treat me like<br> a bawling boy in front of my court,<br> - Ill tear this castle down.<br> - Do so.<br> Annee, even a king cAnneot choose<br> where he will love.<br> I want no one in this kingdom but you.<br> That's why Ive returned.<br> You are not free to love,<br> you have a wife.<br> If a man is married, king or commoner,<br> he is not free.<br> I never married Catherine.<br> England married Spain.<br> My father coupled my brother Arthur<br> with Catherine for the Spanish Alliance.<br> Arthur died and I became heir, so it was<br> decided that I, in my turn, should...<br> ...marry my dead brother's widow.<br> I was 17 and she 23.<br> So England and Spain married,<br> not Henry and Catherine.<br> There's a...<br> There's a curse on that marriage.<br> All my sons were born dead.<br> For 20 years Ive had dead sons.<br> Now she's past the age<br> of bearing children.<br> What has this barren marriage<br> to do with you and me?<br> You cAnneot touch my heart.<br> You cAnneot bribe me with favours.<br> The only love I will give you is the<br> love of a loyal subject for her king.<br> Very well then.<br> As your King,<br> I command you to return with me<br> to the court.<br> I command you to be<br> lady-in-waiting to my wife,<br> Catherine the Queen.<br> You will be in my presence<br> every day of your life.<br> Then we shall see.<br> - Was he shouting for me?<br> - Bellowing.<br> - How they all tremble when he bellows.<br> - And you?<br> Does that tremble?<br> No. But you so hated coming here<br> you spoke wildly.<br> - I fear you might provoke his anger.<br> - That was six months ago.<br> Im still young. I love dancing<br> and new clothes and gifts.<br> - And power.<br> Power is as exciting as love,<br> I discover.<br> And who has more of it than the King?<br> The warship will be launched<br> from Portsmouth<br> in five days time, Your Grace.<br> Here is the warrant.<br> But a name is needed for the vessel.<br> The "Annee Boleyn".<br> - The ambassadors from Spain?<br> - Deal with them yourself.<br> She almost reigns. She entirely rules.<br> And I believe gives... nothing for it.<br> - She could prove powerful.<br> - Thomas, this is a man's world.<br> The seat of power does not lie<br> between a woman's legs.<br> Wolsey, Nan reminds me that her<br> father's patent of the Earl of Wiltshire<br> - has not yet been drawn.<br> - Indeed. It should be done at once.<br> Good. Good.<br> I must tell you, My Lord,<br> a game we ladies-in-waiting play.<br> A game of titles.<br> Who has the most titles in the land?<br> I said that, of course, His Majesty.<br> But another said, "No, no".<br> "The great Cardinal Wolsey<br> has more than the King".<br> "He is Bishop of Tournai, of Lincoln, of<br> Bath and Wells, Durham and Winchester".<br> "He is also Archbishop of York<br> and Papal Legate in England,<br> which puts him above<br> the Archbishop of Canterbury".<br> "Who knows?<br> He may one day be Pope".<br> "So he is the most powerful churchman".<br> "He is also Lord Chancellor and<br> therefore the most powerful layman".<br> I said, "How fortunate for His Majesty<br> that the good Cardinal<br> is devoted only to the King<br> and to England".<br> "Consider how dangerous it would be<br> if so powerful a man<br> had ambitions of his own".<br> His Sovereign,<br> I confess your royal favours<br> showered on me are more than I deserve.<br> I can render nothing<br> but my thanks, my prayers<br> and my unending loyalty.<br> And what livings would you shed<br> to prove your loyalty,<br> my good Vicar of Hell?<br> Any, or all, sir, at your command.<br> And your wealth, My Lord?<br> I believe he is richer even than you.<br> - So many livings, so many palaces.<br> - I wonder.<br> Such vanities mean little to me<br> if I may serve you.<br> Choose anything I have<br> and it is yours, Majesty.<br> I will. I will.<br> When I have given it some thought.<br> Thank you. Thank you, Annee.<br> My Lord, you are as generous<br> as you are great.<br> I shall ask the King to show me<br> your palace at Hampton Court.<br> Bull's-eye.<br> Come, girl, play something cheerful.<br> Men prefer women who laugh and are gay.<br> Well, what more do you want?<br> - Nothing.<br> - For yourself, your family and friends?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Liar!<br> You have a taste for power. Its very<br> common. Ive seen it many times.<br> You don't get it for nothing.<br> You have to pay.<br> You ordered me to court.<br> The power is yours, not mine.<br> Im mad for you. I dream of you<br> at night. I long for you by day.<br> And you dare tell me<br> that I have the power?<br> Im no good with any other woman.<br> I think of nothing but you,<br> of you and me playing dog and bitch,<br> horse and mare,<br> of you and me in every way.<br> I want to fill you up night after night.<br> I want to fill you up with sons.<br> Bastards. They would be bastards.<br> One word more and Ill strike you.<br> One word more.<br> Without marriage, if you and I<br> have sons, they will be bastards.<br> Annee.<br> Forgive me. Forgive me, Annee.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Norfolk, with a message from the King.<br> The devil take him.<br> Bess.<br> - Bess, be gone. Come on.<br> - Out you go, out you go.<br> - What?<br> For form's sake.<br> - Come on, come on.<br> Enter.<br> Well?<br> The King commands that you<br> come at once to the Palace at Greenwich.<br> Does he, My Lord?<br> Is he ill?<br> Is there some urgent danger?<br> A boat is waiting.<br> Norfolk!<br> Is the tide with or against us?<br> I leave such details to the boatman<br> and other riffraff, My Lord.<br> You may go.<br> Enter.<br> What keeps you half the night<br> from getting here?<br> Your Grace, pardon me.<br> Tide is flooding.<br> Tell the Lady Annee the law of England,<br> My Holy Lord Chancellor.<br> Is it not true that I can make<br> legitimate whomsoever I choose?<br> - Most certainly.<br> - The documents can be drawn at once?<br> - Within the hour.<br> - So?<br> Could any child of the King's body<br> be made legitimate?<br> Yes.<br> And such a child would be heir<br> to the throne of England?<br> - Most certainly.<br> - Thank you. Thank you, Thomas.<br> - Take the flooding tide and go home.<br> - Wait.<br> Madam?<br> Surely such a child would be heir<br> to the throne after the Princess Mary,<br> daughter of the King<br> and his rightful Queen?<br> - Well, My Lord?<br> - That might be argued.<br> No. Let us have it clearly.<br> Princess Mary is first in line<br> against any son His Majesty<br> may father out of wedlock.<br> After Mary comes the Duke of Richmond,<br> his bastard by Bessie Blount.<br> Can you deny that he would inherit<br> if she died?<br> Richmond? Oh, he's a sickly fellow.<br> I doubt if he'll live out the year.<br> Then my sister's child by the King.<br> We're affectionate, Mary and I,<br> and forgive each other little things,<br> but if she would rather her son<br> sat on the throne than mine,<br> I would rather mine than hers.<br> And so mine, you must agree,<br> would be fourth in the lists.<br> Who knows, madam,<br> you may not be capable of a son.<br> Ill give the man that marries me<br> a houseful of lusty sons.<br> Marriage.<br> If I were free of Catherine...<br> You cAnneot be free of Catherine.<br> - If I were...<br> - It is impossible.<br> For the last time,<br> if I were free of Catherine<br> and made you the Queen of England,<br> would you marry me?<br> Yes.<br> If you make me Queen of England,<br> Ill marry you...<br> ...and give you sons.<br> Meanwhile...<br> Ill go alone to my bed,<br> with Your Gracious leave.<br> - Brilliant, Your Grace. Brilliant.<br> - You think so?<br> Yes. Keep promising her marriage<br> and the siege will soon be over.<br> - In a month you'll have breached her.<br> - You think I was lying?<br> If wooing, praise,<br> gifts and power have failed<br> then you must try a new strategy.<br> When I go down on my hunkers and pray,<br> good Cardinal, as I do day in, day out,<br> there's only one thing I pray.<br> Show me how to save England<br> from chaos when Im dead.<br> That prayer has just been answered.<br> I shall remarry and have a son.<br> - Divorce? Catherine?<br> - Anneulment.<br> My marriage is cursed<br> and my sons born dead<br> because Ive transgressed God's Law<br> in marrying my brother's wife.<br> It was incest and Ive been punished.<br> I was never married in the eyes of God.<br> Indeed you were, My Lord.<br> Thoroughly married.<br> The Pope granted you a dispensation<br> to marry Catherine when Arthur died.<br> Because England and Spain<br> needed one another.<br> Because your brother was 15<br> and had not consummated the marriage.<br> At 15, I was rogering maids<br> right, left and centre.<br> At the time I believed, and the Pope<br> believed, and my father chose to believe<br> that Catherine was virgin.<br> I was deceived.<br> The marriage was consummated.<br> Prepare the evidence.<br> Get me a case for Anneulment.<br> My Lord, I beg you, as your faithful<br> servant, I beg you to consider.<br> Catherine is a princess of Spain.<br> Try to Anneul your marriage and you'll<br> gather enormous forces against you.<br> Spain, Naples, Germany, the Netherlands.<br> All of them ruled by Catherine's nephew.<br> The Roman Catholic Church.<br> - Your own people who love the Queen.<br> - I will marry Annee!<br> It could mean war.<br> It could mean the loss of your kingdom.<br> I will marry Annee<br> if it breaks the Earth in two<br> and flings the two halves into the void!<br> No. I don't believe it of him.<br> I fear it is true, madam.<br> As Spanish Ambassador, it is my duty<br> to have... many sources of information.<br> Then it is Wolsey, not the King.<br> That butcher's cur, Wolsey,<br> who put it in his mind.<br> Wolsey is preparing the case<br> to take to Rome.<br> Enter.<br> The King is here.<br> He wishes to see Your Majesty.<br> I will do all in my power to aid you.<br> I will send word today to your nephew.<br> - Yes and to His Holiness.<br> - This Pope bends to the wind.<br> Your hope lies in your nephew.<br> - Your Majesty.<br> - My Lord Ambassador.<br> It delights my heart to see you<br> privately after so many months, My Lord.<br> Sit, Kate. Sit.<br> Kate,<br> Ill come bluntly to the point.<br> God tells me that our marriage is a sin.<br> My conscience is deeply troubled.<br> Incest will be punished and we<br> have been punished with dead sons.<br> Our daughter, Mary,<br> is alive and well, Henry.<br> Our marriage must be Anneulled.<br> Then it is true.<br> Wolsey has brought you to this.<br> Kate.<br> - Kate, it's God's will.<br> - My conscience is clear.<br> Help me, for both our sakes.<br> Support me in my case to the Pope.<br> But Im your wife.<br> Do you believe I can ask Pope Clement<br> to tell the world that my father lied?<br> My mother lied?<br> Ferdinand and Isabella,<br> the most christian princes,<br> that each of them lied that my marriage<br> to your brother was never consummated?<br> Your own father signed the paper<br> with them.<br> God knows he lied like a Trojan,<br> in season and out.<br> Ive had little happiness in my life.<br> I was a lonely girl,<br> brought from Spain at 15<br> to be used for English politics.<br> When Arthur died I was pushed aside<br> and kept here for seven years<br> until I could be used for you.<br> And you, I loved.<br> With you I had my only happiness.<br> I love you still.<br> Then do as I ask!<br> No. I will not betray our daughter.<br> Our daughter is a threat,<br> not a blessing.<br> I must...<br> I must have a son!<br> Get one then,<br> from one of your women!<br> Im your wife and your Queen.<br> And neither your nor the Pope<br> can make my child a bastard!<br> If you defy me,<br> Ill have you sent from the court.<br> You shall be shut away in the country.<br> Its you then, and not Wolsey,<br> who really wants this thing.<br> I will have it!<br> I too gave evidence that my marriage<br> to Arthur was never consummated.<br> Did I lie to the Pope<br> all those years ago?<br> Did I lie to God?<br> Did I lie to you?<br> No.<br> I will live and I will die your wife.<br> And your Queen.<br> As soon as I reach Rome, I shall<br> send dispatches back via Holland.<br> See that messengers are there.<br> Not long.<br> Not long to wait now, Nan.<br> I shall believe it<br> on the day it happens.<br> Your Grace.<br> Yes?<br> The Spanish Emperor<br> has captured the Vatican.<br> - Captured the Vatican?<br> - Rome is sacked.<br> The dead in their hundreds<br> lie unburied in the streets.<br> - And the Pope?<br> - Is besieged.<br> What...?<br> By your gracious permission,<br> in private.<br> [courtiers gasp and mutter]<br> Well?<br> The Pope had fled from the Vatican<br> to the town of Orvieto.<br> - We exchanged letters.<br> - Yes and the Anneulment?<br> - He refuses to Anneul your marriage.<br> - He cAnneot!<br> - He cAnneot do anything else.<br> - What's his reason?<br> The Spanish Emperor's<br> got him by the nose.<br> The Pope won't offend that Emperor<br> by Anneulling his aunt's marriage to you.<br> Poor Henry.<br> He shall, by God Almighty.<br> I say he shall!<br> And to hell with the Spanish Emperor.<br> - Sir Thomas.<br> - My Lord Bishop.<br> Shall you in your conscience<br> accept the Anneulment<br> if the decision is for the King?<br> The Pope has answered the King's appeal<br> and has sent Cardinal Campeggio<br> to try this case.<br> Campeggio speaks for His Holiness.<br> I will accept that.<br> I shall speak against it<br> while I have breath.<br> I shall be silent<br> until I am forced to speak.<br> Well, Im an old man and have no family.<br> At my age a good death is better<br> than a bad conscience.<br> Well, you will be the mother and father<br> and I shall be the uncle<br> of a queen next week.<br> - God be praised.<br> - I wonder what Annee is thinking.<br> Out there are my bishops,<br> my courtiers and my loyal subjects.<br> Campeggio is not your subject.<br> But I am, Your Majesty.<br> And I promise you the verdict.<br> You shall see, Annee.<br> Wolsey has never failed me yet.<br> Pray silence for His Grace,<br> the Lord Cardinal of York.<br> Our commission from Rome<br> having been publicly read,<br> this inquiry will now proceed.<br> Henry, King of England,<br> come into court.<br> Here, my lords.<br> Catherine, Queen of England,<br> come into court.<br> On. On.<br> What can I do<br> if the Queen will not appear?<br> - My Lord Cardinal.<br> - Ecco.<br> The King may now proceed.<br> My Lords, I have come to this court<br> not because I wish to discard a wife,<br> but because such grave doubts<br> are cast upon my marriage<br> and such grave fears<br> invest my conscience.<br> I do not wish to marry another woman<br> for carnal pleasure,<br> or nor for any displeasure<br> of the Queen's person or age.<br> This court has been convened<br> to try the validity of that marriage.<br> The bishops assembled here<br> have signed this document<br> declaring that the marriage is in doubt<br> and must be resolved by trial.<br> That is the truth,<br> if it please Your Highness.<br> No, Sir, that is not the truth.<br> - I do not give my consent.<br> - Wolsey.<br> Your memory is failing with age, Bishop.<br> We argued and in the end you agreed<br> that I should sign for you<br> and affix your seal.<br> My Lord, there is nothing more untrue.<br> I told you I would never<br> support this cause.<br> - Well, well, you're only one man.<br> Continue.<br> Hear the witnesses<br> who spoke with my brother<br> the morning after<br> he left the bedchamber.<br> Are we to have no evidence<br> but bedroom sniggering and gossip?<br> Get a message to the Queen.<br> She should be here.<br> She'll let her case go by default.<br> I will hear the Queen.<br> I will only be heard in Rome.<br> I appeal to Rome.<br> I appeal against all judges here.<br> To Rome and to God I commit my cause.<br> Catherine.<br> Catherine!<br> Proceed.<br> - I am going to adjourn.<br> - No, I beseech you, do not.<br> I adjourn this court.<br> - You have the power. Use it.<br> - Power to hear the case, Your Majesty.<br> - But you've heard it, hours of it.<br> - From Your Majesty's witnesses.<br> The Queen says no court in England<br> can be impartial.<br> She appeals directly to Rome.<br> But you are Rome come to England,<br> My Lord.<br> My hands are tied. The trial is<br> adjourned for the Queen's appeal.<br> To the Pope who fears the Queen's nephew<br> more than he loves the justice of God.<br> - Your Grace could be excommunicated!<br> - Get out!<br> Limp back to Rome.<br> Tell His Holiness I will have<br> the marriage Anneulled. Get out, get out.<br> Get out!<br> Well, My Lord Cardinal,<br> so much for your boastful promises.<br> Your Grace, forgive me.<br> Forgive me.<br> Go to the Queen.<br> Banish her from the court<br> and house her at your own expense<br> in some remote place.<br> Yes, Your Majesty.<br> Wolsey.<br> Remove yourself from my sight.<br> You're unfit for office.<br> Render up the Great Seal.<br> And hide, Wolsey.<br> Hide from my anger.<br> Go now. Go.<br> Wolsey.<br> I do not forgive you.<br> I spare you for your past services.<br> The business of the day is over, lawyer.<br> - I am a lawyer who has read the law.<br> - So?<br> There is a law of this land<br> that says it is treason<br> to acknowledge any higher authority<br> than the will of the King.<br> It is, I take it, the will of the King<br> that he shall divorce the Queen<br> and marry the Lady Annee?<br> It is.<br> Then the Church in England<br> must grant your will.<br> It is treasonable to say that the Pope<br> is a higher authority than the King...<br> ...under the law.<br> Ive always been a defender<br> of the faith and of the Church.<br> As matters stand,<br> you are but half the King.<br> To say that Rome may dictate this matter<br> is to say that Rome may dictate<br> the succession to the Crown.<br> What the King of England wants,<br> he should have<br> without hindrance from abroad.<br> True. It is true.<br> It would mean excommunication.<br> It would mean a break with Rome.<br> It would need only the appointment of a<br> new Primate of the Church in England.<br> He would grant the divorce.<br> Yes. And the penalty for those good men<br> who could not stomach your law?<br> The penalty for treason<br> has always been death, Your Grace.<br> You may go.<br> There is something else, Your Majesty.<br> Cardinal Wolsey,<br> through skilful manipulation,<br> has seen to it<br> that the monasteries of England<br> are richer than the goldmines<br> of the New World.<br> If, as you should be, you become Head<br> of the Church, those riches are yours.<br> You're a man without scruple, lawyer.<br> Entirely without scruple.<br> I learned my trade under<br> Cardinal Wolsey, Your Grace.<br> Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal?<br> No, no, I studied under a real master,<br> my father.<br> Whatever villainy was lacking<br> in the world when Henry VII was born,<br> he invented before he left it.<br> But the one cardinal principle<br> he taught me was,<br> always keep the Church on your side.<br> Well, you have the Church on one side<br> and you have me on the other.<br> Yes.

God, forgive me.<br> You great royal fool!<br> Whoa there, boy.<br> Go and get her!<br> - Your pardon, madam, the Queen calls.<br> - Is it born? A boy?<br> It is nearly time, the midwife says.<br> Fetch the King.<br> Ive waited 20 years for this.<br> I shall teach him to ride,<br> wrestle, draw a bow.<br> It makes a man young again<br> to have a son.<br> Your Majesty!<br> Your Majesty!<br> Here comes my good news.<br> The child is born!<br> The child is perfectly formed<br> and in good health, Your Majesty.<br> I have failed.<br> I have failed.<br> God help me<br> Give me privacy.<br> Don't weep.

Do you hear me?<br> - Is she beautiful?<br> - Yes, she is.<br> Give me the child.<br> Give me my daughter.<br> Is he well? Is he strong?<br> My Lord...<br> Those are lungs that will out-bellow<br> the Spanish Ambassador. Ey, Nan?<br> And the eyes. The eyes are clever.<br> We'll call him Edward.<br> Its a lucky name for English Kings.<br> I have borne you a daughter,<br> Your Majesty.<br> - A daughter?<br> - Yes.<br> Why did no one tell me<br> before I entered?<br> I wanted to tell you myself, Hal.<br> We have a beautiful daughter.<br> Next time, a son.<br> Elizabeth.<br> We shall call her Elizabeth.<br> - Is the child in good health?<br> - Perfect, Your Majesty.<br> Good.<br> Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,<br> we can have a healthy son,<br> as you say, as you... say.<br> Ill kiss you and leave you, Annee.<br> God bless all here.<br> Will you not kiss your daughter?<br> My daughter?<br> No. When she's older.<br> When she has a brother.<br> - Still no word from the King?<br> - No, Your Majesty.<br> - No answer even to my letter?<br> - Nothing, Your Majesty.<br> How can he so utterly forget so much?<br> He does not forget, Mother.<br> He just has no wish to remember.<br> But rumours say that<br> all is not well with them.<br> Still no sign of a son.<br> That woman is in despair, they say.<br> For already my beloved father's eye<br> has started to wander again.<br> Poor Hal.<br> Poor Hal.<br> - You pity him?<br> - Was I not his much-loved wife?<br> And you are his daughter.<br> Unless he has a son of a true marriage,<br> you are his heir.<br> You must be Queen.<br> And remember,<br> when Im gone,<br> you're first.<br> Doctor! Quickly!<br> Touch her and Ill have her<br> sent from court.<br> Who?<br> That half-witted Seymour who is always<br> so tongue-tied and blushing and adoring<br> - when you enter my chamber.<br> - She's a child.<br> - But you would get a child by her.<br> - But not by you, except a useless girl.<br> Mind your tongue or Ill have you sent<br> from court to cool your temper, madam.<br> Play on! Play!<br> The Queen is tired, but does not wish<br> to spoil your pleasure.<br> Play!<br> Jane.<br> I...<br> I think we shall dance well together.<br> If I lead strongly,<br> will you softly follow?<br> I hope so, Your Grace.<br> That little sheep won't hold the<br> royal bull beyond the first encounter.<br> I order you!<br> Leave us.<br> Where is Jane Seymour?<br> Cromwell tells me when the dance was<br> ended, she was sent away under guard.<br> She's on her way to Northumberland.<br> As far away as I could send her,<br> since we don't own Scotland.<br> She has the face of a simpering sheep,<br> and the mAnneers. But not the morals.<br> I don't want her near me.<br> - You will bring her back!<br> - I think not!<br> If you want her near you, find a place<br> for her in your palace at Whitehall.<br> Whilst I am here,<br> Jane Seymour must lie elsewhere.<br> Tell her.<br> Your Majesty, the people say<br> that you are the witch Queen.<br> Are we ruled by superstition?<br> Catherine still lives<br> in the heart of the people.<br> The people say that her daughter<br> is the heir and yours the bastard.<br> I do not fear the people.<br> The people hate you, madam,<br> for displacing Queen Catherine<br> and tearing the King<br> away from the true Church.<br> As they hate me<br> for despoiling the monasteries.<br> But the King, they truly love.<br> You and I, madam,<br> live in the protection of the King.<br> So?<br> So in Parliament,<br> which speaks for the people,<br> there is a bill.<br> It is called the Act of Succession.<br> It makes your daughter the heir<br> and Catherine's daughter, Mary,<br> illegitimate.<br> If the King does not wish it, the<br> Act of Succession will not be passed.<br> Would you sacrifice<br> the child of our love<br> to get a silly little harlot<br> brought back to court?<br> One daughter is much like another.<br> I care not who's named bastard<br> when Im dead.<br> If I bring Jane Seymour back<br> you will have Parliament<br> pass the Act of Succession?<br> Yes.<br> What a liar you are.<br> What good is that Act<br> unless every man in the kingdom<br> who has power to accept my child<br> as legitimate heir<br> first swears an oath of fealty<br> to you as Head of the Church?<br> And if they do not, Act of Succession<br> or no Act of Succession,<br> they will say my child is the bastard<br> and there's an end!<br> Go.<br> Nan, if you love me, don't defy me.<br> Bring her back.<br> I love you.<br> I shall go to my grave loving you,<br> no doubt, and hating you.<br> I will bring her back to my court<br> if the oath is sworn<br> by all men of power, high and low.<br> But those who refuse must die.<br> - You once said they must not die.<br> - You once said they must.<br> And now so say I.<br> Annee.<br> Annee.<br> If you love me, forget the succession.<br> If you remember how it all came about,<br> how can you look me in my eyes<br> and say our daughter will not succeed?<br> Because it would need unlimited murder.<br> Nan, look at me.<br> Is it fitting I should be Head<br> of the Church, Pope and King at once,<br> a farce so that so many men must die?<br> Could you sign the death warrants?<br> Id sign 10,000<br> rather than disinherit my blood!<br> Its that, or else it's my blood<br> and Elizabeth's.<br> Cromwell knows that.<br> Your butcher cleaver man knows that.<br> Send him to implement these details,<br> and let it be done quickly.<br> High or low, they will sign.<br> I wish I were loved, but Im not.<br> And yet I am Queen of this island<br> and Elizabeth also shall be Queen.<br> For Elizabeth, no.<br> For her I will not commit murder.<br> Annee, if we had a male heir,<br> your son and mine...<br> I can be angrier than you've seen me.<br> I know where your heart is, not with me.<br> What has love got to do<br> with begetting of a king?<br> Im not young. Im not true.<br> Im bitter. Im envious.<br> Im dangerous. Im malicious!<br> Its your misfortune that you love me<br> now that I no longer love you.<br> And yet, at this moment I want you<br> because of the anger in your face<br> - and the spark of blood in your cheek.<br> - No.<br> Annee, give me a prince<br> and everything would be forgotten.<br> No! Not unless you kill them,<br> More and Houghton and Fisher<br> and all who will not sign,<br> not unless Elizabeth is your heir!<br> Ill kill them, then.<br> I rob, murder and commit sacrilege...<br> at your command.<br> You do what you wish<br> and call the deed mine.<br> I hate you.<br> I hate your desire and mine!<br> I pray you, Master Kingston,<br> see me safe up.<br> As for my coming down,<br> let me shift for myself.<br> Good people, it has...<br> The King's orders.<br> You must not be heard.<br> Well, then I will not speak.<br> I die the King's good servant,<br> but God's first.<br> No!<br> No! No!<br> - Well?<br> - A boy born dead.<br> She has miscarried of her saviour.<br> I am accursed!<br> A live daughter and a dead son!<br> Did I accept excommunication for this?<br> Did I send More, Houghton and Fisher<br> to their death for this?<br> She cAnneot give me a living son!<br> Very well, then.<br> If she cAnneot give me a male heir,<br> I shall rid myself of her.<br> Sir, with Catherine's death,<br> Annee is too firmly the Queen.<br> Find a way. Find a legal way.<br> I will divorce Annee.<br> Divorce is like killing. After the<br> first time, it doesn't seem difficult.<br> Your Grace, we asserted English law.<br> Annee is now Queen by English law.<br> Indeed. Indeed.<br> I divorced Catherine in good faith.<br> But since that time, I have discovered<br> an impediment to my marriage to Annee.<br> I had a child by her sister Mary.<br> That, too, is incestuous.<br> We used the incest excuse last time.<br> We can't make a habit of it.<br> Neither Pope nor Emperor will<br> uphold her and the people hate her.<br> She'd fight. Her sister was married. You<br> couldn't prove it wasn't her husband's.<br> - Who do you serve?<br> - The King, Sir.<br> Your Grace can't afford<br> to start all that again.<br> Then do you know another way?<br> No, you! You tied me to her!<br> Now you find a way to get rid of her!<br> Perhaps...<br> ...in her own life.<br> Her life?<br> Yes.<br> Her marriage contract with Percy.<br> He had her.<br> That's it, you crawling toad.<br> No, Your Grace, not her past life,<br> the present.<br> - The rumours that she has a lover.<br> - Annee? A lover?<br> I, a cuckold?<br> - Why, you're mad.<br> - If I could prove it?<br> Invent it, you mean,<br> with false evidence.<br> Adultery is high treason.<br> The penalty is death.<br> Get out.<br> Cromwell.<br> Its most kind of you<br> to come, Master Smeaton.<br> I am honoured.<br> When invited to supper,<br> Im expected to sing for it.<br> - As you do for the Queen?<br> - Oh, that is my pleasure.<br> She wishes me to be the first<br> music teacher to the Princess.<br> Please, sit.<br> No other guests.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, for the Queen to make<br> the Princess your pupil,<br> she must think most highly of you.<br> Ah, the advantages of music.<br> I did not know<br> that music interested you.<br> It doesn't.<br> I am interested in the Queen,<br> and you know her so well.<br> Why, Im merely a servant.<br> I have the King's express orders<br> to protect the Queen's person.<br> We have learned of threats.<br> Oh, many hate her.<br> I am dining you, as I will dine others,<br> to get to know those whom I may trust.<br> Oh, I see, I see.<br> And it is true that she likes<br> to have you close to her, is it not?<br> Without boasting,<br> I believe she prefers me to many.<br> She prefers my style to the Italian.<br> It is nearer to the mAnneer<br> she loved in the French Court.<br> She learned to love<br> like a French woman.<br> Yes, simple tunes sung with...<br> You would be wiser not to laugh.<br> It is a more valuable asset<br> than a pleasant singing voice.<br> I make my way by singing. Ive no desire<br> to go any further by any other route.<br> Come now.<br> There are only two reasons for you to be<br> constantly in the Queen's apartments.<br> You love her,<br> or you are in the pay of Spain.<br> - Why, I go when I am sent for.<br> - To love or spy? Which?<br> Im sorry...<br> Which?<br> You're too simple to spy,<br> I know that.<br> - So it is love. You love her.<br> - No! No!<br> You do not love your Queen?<br> Well, yes, all right, I do love her.<br> As my Queen.<br> - And she loves you.<br> - No, Sir, of course not.<br> Barton, come out here.<br> Bring your papers.<br> The last reply, but one.<br> ''Well, yes, all right, I do love her.''<br> - What are you trying to make me say?<br> - The truth.<br> - That you are the Queen's lover.<br> - Oh, no.<br> No! No!<br> - You first slept with her in February.<br> - I never!<br> - On the 18th of February.<br> - No!<br> Surely you remember<br> such an important date?<br> - No!<br> - Come, try to remember.<br> No! No! No!<br> - Try!<br> - Yes!<br> Yes! Yes! Yes!<br> Anyone can walk,<br> but can you walk with a train?<br> - Yes.<br> - All right, head up.<br> Go on. Good!<br> Don't look round. Go on.<br> It will follow you like a kitten's tail.<br> Oh, what a queen it will make some day.<br> - Enter.<br> - Madam, the Duke of Norfolk insists...<br> Uncle! This is a rare honour nowadays.<br> Leave us.<br> Nan, brace yourself, girl.<br> I have a warrant for your arrest.<br> For my arrest?<br> A poor joke.<br> Its not a joke, Annee.<br> I could've let others do it,<br> but I felt I could do it more gently.<br> But Im the Queen.<br> How could I be arrested? For what?<br> Adultery, it says here.<br> Nonsense no doubt, but there it is.<br> Adultery? With whom?<br> - Smeaton, Norris and others.<br> - I thought you were serious.<br> - I am.<br> I am to take you to the Tower.<br> There's to be a trial. I am to preside.<br> But Im the Queen.<br> My child, she's the King's heir.<br> Leave her with your women.<br> Annee, you must come at once.<br> Elizabeth!<br> Annee.<br> Down? Master Kingston,<br> shall I be shut in a dungeon?<br> No, madam. You will be lodged<br> near the room where you lay<br> on the night before your coronation.<br> Oh, Jesus, have mercy on me.<br> I am Lady Kingston, madam.<br> I will wait upon you.<br> Will you?<br> Then go away. Leave me!<br> I fear, madam, that she must stay.<br> Every word spoken to you<br> or by you must be reported.<br> Send them away, Norfolk!<br> - Leave us.<br> - But...<br> Leave us!<br> Shall I ever be allowed to walk out<br> and look at the sky?<br> Shall I ever be free?<br> Norris, Weston, his friends?<br> His friends since I first met him?<br> - And they are accused with me?<br> - Yes.<br> He is willing to kill them<br> to get rid of me?<br> - To kill his closest friends?<br> - [man] Come on! The other way!<br> My brother.<br> Why have they arrested him?<br> He also is accused of being your lover.<br> Incest.<br> Oh, God help me. The King is mad.<br> I am doomed.<br> Your Highness,<br> you are accused of high treason<br> in that you, being the lawfully<br> wedded wife of our Lord the King,<br> did commit adultery.<br> I ask that you answer my questions.<br> By what lawful authority<br> am I called here?<br> I am your Queen. And, as such, share the<br> King's immunity from arrest and trial.<br> Norris, Weston, Smeaton and Brereton<br> were tried and condemned ten days ago.<br> If they are guilty, then you are guilty.<br> - Did they plead guilty?<br> - They were found guilty.<br> They were innocent as I am innocent!<br> Any man, no matter who he is,<br> who says the contrary is a liar!<br> My Lord, the warrant of treason<br> was issued by direction of the King.<br> That is sufficient to give jurisdiction,<br> however, so that there may be no<br> possibility of doubt as to her guilt,<br> - will My Lord call the first witness?<br> - Call the Earl of Rochford.<br> George Boleyn, Earl of Rochford,<br> come into court.<br> The Earl of Rochford.<br> Read the indictment.<br> George Boleyn,<br> you are accused of high treason,<br> in that on certain days and dates,<br> here specified,<br> you did commit adultery<br> with Annee, Queen of England.<br> Being your own sister in the flesh,<br> an act of incest.<br> No! Not true!<br> It is not your turn to speak.<br> How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?<br> You are a foul liar,<br> and my judges are your creatures.<br> Stand up, Thomas Boleyn,<br> Earl of Wiltshire. Come to the bar.<br> Do you recognize<br> these two here accused,<br> known as Annee and George Boleyn,<br> as issue of your body?<br> - I do.<br> - Look at them, My Lord.<br> By the same mother, Elizabeth Howard,<br> daughter of the late Duke of Norfolk,<br> and therefore full brother and sister<br> in the flesh<br> so that their lying together<br> would be incest?<br> - Yes.<br> - For which the penalty is death.<br> Proper evidence will be introduced<br> later. Remove the prisoner.<br> That's all, My Lord.<br> As father of the accused,<br> you are excused your duty as a judge<br> and may leave.<br> Present your next witness.<br> - Mark Smeaton, come into court.<br> - Mark Smeaton.<br> My Lords, this man<br> was tried as a commoner.<br> He confessed and was found guilty<br> of adultery with the Queen<br> by a jury of his own order.<br> He will give evidence against the Queen.<br> Put your questions.<br> Smeaton, did you have carnal relations<br> with the Queen?<br> Smeaton, did you lie with the Queen?<br> No.<br> There is mercy only for those<br> that tell the truth.<br> Three men have been found guilty<br> on your evidence.

Whether<br> you say aye or no, I shall never know.<br> You come here to make sure<br> whether there was truly adultery<br> because that would touch<br> your manhood or your pride<br> and even so, my heart and my eyes<br> are glad of you.<br> Fool of all women that I am,<br> Im glad of you here.<br> Go, then.<br> Keep your pride of manhood,<br> you know about me now.<br> Nan, is it true<br> that you're glad to see me?<br> - Yes, it's true.<br> - Then, Annee,<br> let's do all gently for old time's sake.<br> I have no wish to harm you,<br> and your words have moved me deeply.<br> I must be free to have a son,<br> and the son must be free<br> to rule England when I die.<br> Why must you leave a king to follow you?<br> Why not a queen?<br> This country has never been ruled<br> by a queen. It never could be.<br> We can never have a son now,<br> God has spoken.<br> I must have a son elsewhere.<br> And it's getting late.<br> Im not as young as I was.<br> What do you want of me?<br> Agree to Anneul the marriage<br> and give up all rights.<br> You shall go abroad and take Elizabeth<br> with you. You will be well cared for.<br> Please set me free.<br> To marry Seymour<br> and make our child a bastard?<br> No. No. No.<br> Nan...

Well, I won't have it!<br> We are man and wife together.<br> King and Queen. I keep that.<br> Take it from me as best you can.<br> Then you have decided, and so have I!<br> Before you go,<br> perhaps you should hear one thing.<br> I lied to you.<br> I said ''I love you'', but I lied.<br> I was untrue. Untrue with many.<br> - That is a lie.<br> - It is true.<br> I was unfaithful to you<br> with all of them.<br> With half your court! With soldiers<br> of your guard, grooms, stable hands.<br> Look, for the rest of your life,<br> at every man that ever knew me<br> and wonder if I didn't find him<br> a better man than you!<br> You whore!<br> But Elizabeth was yours.<br> Watch her as she grows.<br> She's yours. She's a Tudor.<br> Get yourself a son on that<br> sweet pale girl if you can<br> and hope that it will live.<br> But Elizabeth shall reign after you.<br> Yes! Elizabeth,<br> child of Annee the whore<br> and Henry the bloodstained lecher,<br> shall be Queen.<br> You've asked for death<br> and you shall have it.<br> So be it.<br> Only what I take to my grave,<br> you take to yours.<br> And think of this, Henry.<br> Elizabeth shall be a greater queen<br> than any king of yours.<br> She shall rule a greater England<br> than you could ever have built.<br> Yes! My Elizabeth shall be Queen.<br> And my blood will have been well spent.<br> She's lying.<br> She was never unfaithful to me.<br> She could. Any woman could.<br> No. She lies.<br> If she lies, let her die for lying.<br> Let her die!<br> - Is everything ready?<br> - Yes, My Lord. The Queen is at prayer.<br> Fetch her.<br> The time for prayer is passed.<br> - And where is the King?<br> - At Richmond. Out hunting.<br> Will you join him later?<br> No, by God.<br> For me there's killing enough this day.<br> [executioner speaks French]<br> Will it hurt?<br> They say not, My Lady.<br> The executioner from France<br> is an expert with the sword.<br> I hear that he is good.<br> And I have a little neck.<br> - Oh, My Lady.<br> - No, Kingston. No.<br> Come, I am glad to die.<br> The month is May.<br> - My Lady?<br> - Nothing.<br> Mon Dleu! She looks at me!<br> Distract her!<br> - Away, My Lords.<br> - Where to, Your Grace?<br> To Mistress Seymour's.<br> Elizabeth shall be a greater<br> queen than any king of yours.<br> She shall rule a greater England<br> than you could ever have built.<br> My Elizabeth shall be Queen.<br> And my blood will have been well spent.<br>
