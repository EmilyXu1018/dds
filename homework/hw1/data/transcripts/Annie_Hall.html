                        There's an old joke. Two elderly women|are at a Catskill Mountain resort.<br> One of 'em says,|''The food at this place is really terrible.''<br> The other one says,|''Yeah, I know. And such small portions.''<br> Well..that's essentially how I feel about life.<br> Full of loneliness and misery|and suffering and unhappiness.<br> And it's all over much too quickly.<br> The other important joke for me is one|that's usually attributed to Groucho Marx.<br> I think it appears originally in Freud's|Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious.<br> It goes like this - I'm paraphrasing.|I would never wanna belong to any club<br> that would have|someone like me for a member.<br> That's the key joke of my adult life|in terms of my relationships with women.<br> Lately the strangest things|have been going through my mind.<br> Cos I turned 40, and I guess|I'm going through a life crisis.<br> I'm not worried about ageing.|Although I'm balding slightly on top.<br> That's about the worst|you can say about me.<br> I think I'm gonna get better as I get older.<br> I think I'm gonna be|the balding virile type,<br> as opposed to, say,|the distinguished grey, for instance.<br> Unless I'm one of those guys with|saliva dribbling out of his mouth,<br> who wanders into a cafeteria|with a shopping bag,<br> screaming about socialism.<br> Annie and I broke up.|And I still can't get my mind around that.<br> I keep sifting the pieces of|the relationship through my mind,<br> examining my life, and trying to|figure out - where did the screwup come?<br> A year ago we were... in love, you know.<br> And... It's funny... I'm not a morose type.|I'm not a depressive character.<br> I... I... You know...<br> I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess.<br> I was brought up in Brooklyn|during World War II.<br> He's been depressed.|All of a sudden he can't do anything.<br> - Why are you depressed, Alvy?|- Tell Dr Flicker.<br> It's something he read.<br> Something he read, uh?<br> - The universe is expanding.|- The universe is expanding?<br> The universe is everything. If it's|expanding, someday it will break apart<br> and that will be the end of everything.<br> What is that your business?<br> He stopped doing his homework.<br> - What's the point?|- What has the universe got to do with it?<br> You're here in Brooklyn!|Brooklyn is not expanding!<br> It won't be expanding|for billions of years yet, Alvy.<br> And we've gotta try and enjoy ourselves|while we're here, uh?<br> My analyst says I exaggerate|my childhood memories.<br> But I was brought up|under the roller coaster<br> in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn.<br> Maybe that accounts for my personality,|which is a little nervous.<br> I have a hyperactive imagination.<br> My mind tends to jump around a little.<br> I have some trouble|between fantasy and reality.<br> My father ran the bumper car concession.<br> There he is.<br> And there I am.<br> I used to get my aggression out|through those cars all the time.<br> I remember the staff at our public school.<br> We had a saying.:|''Those who can't do, teach,<br> and those who can't teach, teach gym. ''<br> And those who couldn't do anything,|I think, were assigned to our school.<br> I always thought|my schoolmates were idiots.<br> Melvyn Greenglass. His fat little face.<br> And Henrietta Farrell.|Just Miss Perfect all the time.<br> And Ivan Ackerman.|Always the wrong answer. Always.<br> Seven and three is nine.<br> Even then, I knew they were just jerks.<br> In 1942 I had already discovered women.<br> He kissed me! He kissed me!<br> That's the second time this month!|Step up here.<br> - What did I do?|- Step up here!<br> You should be ashamed of yourself.<br> Why? I was just expressing|a healthy sexual curiosity.<br> Six-year-old boys|don't have girls on their minds.<br> I did.<br> For God's sakes, Alvy!|Even Freud speaks of a latency period.<br> Well, I never had a latency period.|I can't help it.<br> Why couldn't you have been more like|Donald? Now there was a model boy.<br> Tell the folks where you are today.<br> I run a profitable dress company.<br> Sometimes I wonder|where my classmates are today.<br> I'm president of|the Pinkus Plumbing Company.<br> I sell tallises.<br> I used to be a heroin addict.|Now I'm a methadone addict.<br> I'm into leather.<br> I lost track of most of my schoolmates,|but I wound up a comedian.<br> They did not take me in the army.|I was... Interestingly enough... I was 4-P.<br> In the event of war, I'm a hostage.<br> You always only saw the worst in people.<br> You never could get along|with anyone in school.<br> You were always out of step|with the world.<br> Even when you got famous,|you still distrusted the world.<br> I distinctly heard it.|He muttered under his breath, ''Jew.''<br> You're crazy.<br> We were walking off the tennis court.|Him and me and his wife.<br> He looked at her and they both looked at|me. And under his breath he said, ''Jew.''<br> Alvy, you're a total paranoid.<br> I pick up on those kinda things.<br> I was having lunch with some guys from|NBC. So I said, ''Did you eat yet or what?''<br> And Tom Christie said, ''No. D'you?''<br> Not ''Did you''. ''D'you eat?'' ''D'you?''<br> Not ''Did you eat?'' but ''D'you eat?''|''Jew?'' You get it? ''Jew eat?''<br> - Max...|- Stop calling me Max.<br> Why, Max? It's a good name for you.|Max, you see conspiracies in everything.<br> I was in a record store. There's|this big, tall, blond, crew-cutted guy,<br> looking at me in a funny way and saying,|''We have a sale this week on Wagner.''<br> Wagner, Max. Wagner. I know what he's|really trying to tell me, very significantly.<br> Right, Max.<br> California, Max.<br> - Get the hell out of this crazy city.|- Forget it.<br> We move to sunny LA.|All of show business is there.<br> No. I don't wanna live in a city|where the only cultural advantage<br> is that you can make|a right turn on a red light.<br> Forget it.|Aren't you late for meeting Annie?<br> I'm meeting her at the Beekman.|I have a few minutes.<br> Are you on television?<br> Once in a while. Occasionally.<br> - What's your name?|- You wouldn't know it. lt doesn't matter.<br> You were on the... uh...|'The Johnny Carson', right?<br> Once in a while, you know.<br> What's your name?<br> I'm... I'm Robert Redford.<br> Come on!<br> Alvy Singer. lt was nice...|Thanks very much for everything.<br> Hey!<br> What?<br> This is Alvy Singer!<br> Fellas, you know...<br> This guy's on television.|Alvy Singer? Am I right?<br> - Give me a break.|- This guy's on television.<br> I need a large polo mallet.<br> - Who's on television?|- On 'The Johnny Carson Show.<br> Is this a meeting of the Teamsters?<br> - What programme?|- Can I have your autograph?<br> - You don't want my autograph.|- No, I do. It's for my girlfriend.<br> Make it out to Ralph.<br> - Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?|- It's for my brudder.<br> You're really Alvy Singer, the TV star?<br> Alvy Singer over here!<br> It's all right, fellas.<br> Jesus! What did you do?|Come by way of the Panama Canal?<br> - I'm in a bad mood.|- I'm here with the cast of 'The Godfather'.<br> - You have to learn to deal with it.|- I'm dealing with guys named Cheech!<br> Please. I have a headache, all right?<br> You are in a bad mood.|You must be getting your period.<br> Every time anything out of the ordinary|happens, you think I'm getting my period!<br> A little louder. I think|one of them may have missed it.<br> - Has the picture started?|- It started two minutes ago.<br> That's it. Forget it. I can't go in.<br> - Two minutes, Alvy.|- I can't do it. We've blown it already.<br> I can't go in in the middle.<br> We'll only miss the titles.|They're in Swedish.<br> - You wanna get coffee for two hours?|- Two hours? No. I'm going in.<br> - Go ahead. Goodbye.|- While we're talking, we could be inside.<br> Can we not stand here and argue|in front of everybody? I get embarrassed.<br> All right. So what do you wanna do?<br> I don't know now.|You wanna go to another movie?<br> Let's go see 'The Sorrow and the Pity'.<br> Come on. I'm not in the mood to see|a four-hour documentary on Nazis.<br> Well, I'm sorry. I've gotta see a picture|exactly from the start to the finish.<br> Cos... Cos I'm anal.<br> That's a polite word for what you are.<br> We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.|It is not one of his best.<br> It lacks a cohesive structure.<br> You get the feeling that he's not|absolutely sure what it is he wants to say.<br> I've always felt he was essentially|a technical filmmaker.<br> Granted, 'La Strada' was a great film.|Great in its use of negative imagery.<br> I can't stand this guy.|I'm gonna have a stroke.<br> Well, stop listening to him.<br> He's screaming his opinions in my ear.<br> Like all that 'Juliet of the Spirits'|or 'Satyricon'.<br> I found it incredibly... indulgent.<br> He really is. He's one of|the most indulgent filmmakers.<br> The key word here is indulgent.<br> Without getting...<br> - What are you depressed about?|- I missed my therapy. I overslept.<br> - How can you possibly oversleep?|- The alarm clock.<br> Do you know|what a hostile gesture that is to me?<br> I know.|Because of our sexual problem, right?<br> Everybody at 'The New Yorker'|has to know our rate of intercourse?<br> It's like Samuel Beckett.<br> I admire the technique,|but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.<br> - I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.|- Stop it, Alvy!<br> He's spitting on my neck.|He's spitting on my neck when he talks.<br> You know, you're so egocentric|that if I miss my therapy,<br> you can only think of it|in terms of how it affects you.<br> Weltanschauung is what it is.<br> Probably on their first date.<br> Probably met by answering an ad|in the 'New York Review of Books'.<br> ''Thirtyish academic|wishes to meet woman<br> who's interested in Mozart,|James Joyce and sodomy.''<br> Our sexual problem? I'm comparatively|normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.<br> OK. I'm very sorry. My sexual problem.|OK? My sexual problem.<br> I never read that. That was a Henry James|novel? Sequel of 'The Turn of the Screw'?<br> It's the influence of television.<br> Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it|in terms of it being a high...<br> high intensity.|You understand? A hot medium...<br> What I wouldn't give for a large sock|with horse manure in it.<br> What do you do when you get stuck in|a movie line with a guy like this behind?<br> Why can't I give my opinion?|It's a free country.<br> Do you have to give it so loud? Aren't|you ashamed to pontificate like that?<br> The funny part is, you don't know|anything about Marshall McLuhan.<br> Really? I happen to teach a class|at Columbia called 'TV, Media and Culture'.<br> So I think my insights into Mr McLuhan|have a great deal of validity.<br> Oh, do you? That's funny, because|I happen to have Mr McLuhan right here.<br> Just let me... Come over here a second.<br> I heard what you were saying.<br> You know nothing of my work.<br> You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.<br> How you ever got to teach a course|in anything is totally amazing.<br> Boy, if life were only like this!<br> June 14th, 1940.|The German army occupies Paris.<br> All over the country, people are desperate|for every available scrap of news.<br> Those guys in the French Resistance|were really brave.<br> To have to listen to|Maurice Chevalier sing so much.<br> Sometimes I ask myself|how I'd stand up under torture.<br> The Gestapo would take away|your Bloomingdale's charge card<br> and you'd tell 'em everything.<br> That movie makes me feel guilty.<br> Yeah, cos it's supposed to.<br> Alvy...<br> What? What... What's the matter?<br> I don't... I don't know.<br> It's not natural. We're sleeping in a bed|together. You know, it's been a long time.<br> Well, it's just that I gotta sing tomorrow|night, so I have to rest my voice.<br> There's always an excuse.|You used to think I was very sexy.<br> When we first started going out,|we had sex constantly.<br> We're probably|in the 'Guinness Book of World Records'.<br> Alvy, it'll pass.|I'm going through a phase. That's all.<br> You've been married before.|You know how things can get.<br> You were very hot for Allison at first.<br> You're on right after Chris Brown,|which looks about 20 minutes.<br> Excuse me. When do I go on?<br> Who are you?<br> Alvy Singer.<br> I'm a comedian.<br> Oh, comedian. Yeah.<br> Oh. You're on next.<br> What do you mean, next? I'm...<br> You're on right after this act.<br> No, it can't be. Because he's a comic.<br> Yes.<br> - You're putting on two comics in a row?|- Why not?<br> No, I'm sorry. I don't wanna go on|after another comedian.<br> It's OK.<br> No. Because they're laughing.|So I'd... rather not.<br> Will you relax? They're gonna love you.<br> I'd prefer not to. Look.|They're laughing at him.<br> They're gonna laugh at him|then I gotta go out.<br> I gotta get laughs too.|How much can they laugh?<br> - They're laughed out.|- Do you feel all right?<br> Jesus!<br> What's your name?<br> Allison.<br> Yeah?<br> Allison what?<br> Portchnik.<br> - That's nice.|- Thank you.<br> Allison Portchnik.<br> So, what are you telling me? You work|for Stevenson all the time or what?<br> No. I'm in the midst of doing my thesis.<br> On what?<br> Political Commitment|in 20th-Century Literature.<br> You're like... New York, Jewish,|left-wing, liberal, intellectual,<br> Central Park West, Brandeis University,|socialist summer camps?<br> The father with the Ben Shahn drawings?|The really strike-oriented...<br> Stop me before I make|a complete imbecile of myself.<br> No. That was wonderful. I love|being reduced to a cultural stereotype.<br> Right. I'm a bigot. But for the Left.<br> I have to go out there.|Say something encouraging. Quickly.<br> - I think you're cute.|- Do you?<br> Go ahead.<br> I don't know why they would have me|at this kind of rally cos...<br> I'm not essentially|a political comedian at all.<br> I interestingly had... dated a woman<br> in the Eisenhower administration briefly.<br> And it was ironic to me cos...<br> Cos I was trying to do to her<br> what Eisenhower has been doing|to the country for the last eight years.<br> I'm sorry. I can't go through with this.<br> I can't get it off my mind, Allison.|It's obsessing me.<br> I'm getting tired of it.|I need your attention.<br> But it doesn't make any sense.|He drove past the book depository,<br> and the police said conclusively|that it was an exit wound.<br> So how is it possible for Oswald|to have fired from two angles at once?<br> It doesn't make sense!<br> I'll tell you this.|He was not marksman enough<br> to hit a moving target at that range.<br> But...<br> if there was a second assassin...<br> - That's it!|- We've been through this.<br> They recovered the shells from that rifle.<br> OK. What are you saying now?<br> Everybody on the Warren Commission|is in on this conspiracy, right?<br> Well, why not?<br> Yeah. Earl Warren?<br> Hey, honey. I don't know Earl Warren.<br> Lyndon Johnson?<br> Lyndon Johnson is a politician!|You know the ethics those guys have.<br> It's like a notch|underneath child molester.<br> Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.<br> The FBI and the CIA|and J Edgar Hoover and oil companies<br> and the Pentagon and the men's room|attendant at the White House.<br> I would leave out|the men's room attendant.<br> You're using this conspiracy theory|as an excuse to avoid sex with me.<br> Oh, my God!<br> She's right.<br> Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?<br> She was beautiful, she was willing,|she was real intelligent.<br> Is it the old Groucho Marx joke that|I just don't wanna belong to any club<br> that would have|someone like me for a member?<br> Alvy, don't panic! Please stop it!<br> It's a mistake to ever bring|a live thing in the house.<br> Stop it! Go for that one there.<br> Maybe we should call the police.|Dial 911 . It's the lobster squad.<br> They're only baby ones, for God's sakes.<br> - If they're only babies, you pick 'em up.|- All right! All right!<br> - Here you go!|- Don't give it to me! Don't!<br> Look! One crawled|behind the refrigerator.<br> It'll turn up in our bed at night.<br> Will you get out of here|with that thing? Jesus!<br> Talk to 'em. You speak shellfish.<br> Hey, look.

Maybe I should take...<br> ''Introduction to the Novel''.<br> Just don't take any course|where they make you read 'Beowulf'.<br> Hey, what do you think? You think we|should go to that party in Southampton?<br> Don't be silly.|What do we need other people for?<br> We should just turn out the lights|and play hide the salami or something.<br> Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette.<br> Grass, right?

It's terrific.<br> Can I confess something?<br> I tell you this because,|as an artist, I think you'll understand.<br> Sometimes when I'm driving,<br> on the road at night, I see|two headlights coming toward me.<br> Fast. I have this sudden impulse|to turn the wheel quickly,<br> head-on into the oncoming car.<br> I can anticipate the explosion.<br> The sound of shattering glass. The...<br> flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.<br> Right. Well...<br> I have to go now, Duane, because I...<br> I'm due back on the planet Earth.<br> - Don't let it be so long.|- Look up Uncle Billy.<br> - He is adorable.|- Do you think so?<br> - You're taking them to the airport?|- Duane can.

How did it go?<br> Oh, it was really weird,|but she's a very nice woman.<br> I didn't have to lie down on the couch.|She had me sitting up.<br> I told her about the family|and my feelings towards men<br> and my relationship with my brother.<br> She mentioned penis envy.|Do you know about that?<br> I'm one of the few males who suffers|from that. Go on. I'm interested.<br> She said I was very guilty about my|impulses towards marriage and children.<br> Then I remembered, when I was a kid, I|accidentally saw my parents making love.<br> All this happened the first hour?<br> I've been going for 15 years.|I don't have... nothing like that.<br> I told her my dream and then I cried.<br> You cried? I have never once cried.|That's fantastic.<br> I whine. I sit and I whine.<br> In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding this|pillow across my face and I can't breathe.<br> - Sinatra?|- Yeah. Strangling me.<br> Sure. Because he's a singer|and you're a singer.<br> It's perfect.|So you're trying to suffocate yourself.<br> It's a perfect analytic kind of insight.<br> She said your name was Alvy Singer.<br> - What do you mean? Me?|- Yeah, you.<br> Because in the dream|I break Sinatra's glasses.<br> You never said Sinatra had glasses. What|are you saying? That I'm suffocating you?<br> God, Alvy. I did this|really terrible thing to him.<br> Because then, when he sang,|it was in this real high-pitched voice.<br> What did the doctor say?<br> I should probably come five times a week.<br> I don't think I mind analysis at all. The|only question is, will it change my wife?<br> - Will it change your wife?|- My life.<br> - You said, ''Will it change my wife?''|- I said, ''Will it change my life?''<br> - You said wife.|- Life! I said life.<br> She said, ''Will it change my wife?''|You heard that, so I'm not crazy.<br> I told her I didn't think|you'd ever take me seriously,<br> because you don't think|I'm smart enough.<br> Why do you always bring that up?<br> Because I encourage you|to take adult education courses?<br> You meet wonderful,|interesting professors.<br> Adult education is such junk.|The professors are so phoney.<br> I don't care what you say about David.|He's a fine teacher.<br> And why are you following me around?<br> - I was following you and David.|- Let's call it quits.<br> That's fine. That's great.|I don't know what I did wrong.<br> She cooled off to me.|Is it something that I did?<br> It's never something you do.|That's how people are. Love fades.<br> Love fades? God!|That's a depressing thought.<br> I have to ask you a question.|With your wife in bed,<br> does she need some kind of|artificial stimulation? Like marijuana?<br> We use a large vibrating egg.<br> A large vibrating egg?<br> Well, I ask a psychopath,|I get that kind of an answer. Jesus!<br> Here. You look like a very happy couple.<br> - Are you?|- Yeah.<br> So how do you account for it?<br> I'm very shallow and empty,<br> and I have no ideas|and nothing interesting to say.<br> - And I'm exactly the same way.|- I see. Well, that's very interesting.<br> So you've managed|to work out something, huh?<br> Well, thanks very much for talking to me.<br> Even as a kid, I always went for the|wrong women. I think that's my problem.<br> My mother took me to see Snow White.|Everyone fell in love with Snow White.<br> I immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.<br> - We never have any fun any more.|- How can you say that?<br> You're always leaning on me|to improve myself.<br> You must be getting your period.<br> I don't get a period!|I'm a cartoon character.<br> Can't I be upset once in a while?<br> Max, forget about Annie.|I know lots of women you can date.<br> I don't wanna go out|with any other women.<br> I have got a girl for you. You'll love her.|She's a reporter for 'Rolling Stone'.<br> I think there are more people here to see|the Maharishi than there were for Dylan.<br> I covered the Dylan concert,|which gave me chills.<br> Especially when he sang,|''She takes just like a woman.''<br> ''And she makes love just like a woman.|Yes, she does.''<br> ''And she aches just like a woman.''<br> ''But she breaks just like a little girl.''<br> After that,|the most charismatic event I covered<br> was Mick's birthday|at Madison Square Garden.<br> - That's great. That's just great.|- Did you catch Dylan?<br> Me? No, I couldn't make it.|My raccoon had hepatitis.<br> You have a raccoon?<br> A few.<br> The only word for this is transplendid.<br> It's transplendid.<br> I can think of another word.<br> He's God. This man is God.|He's got millions of followers<br> who would crawl across the world|just to touch the hem of his garment.<br> Yeah? Must be a tremendous hem.<br> I'm a Rosicrucian myself.<br> I can't get with any religion|that advertises in 'Popular Mechanics'.<br> Look. There's God|coming out of the men's room.<br> It's unbelievably transplendid!<br> I was at the Stones concert|when they killed that guy.<br> Were you?|I was at an Alice Cooper thing<br> where six people were rushed|to the hospital with bad vibes.<br> I hope you don't mind|that I took so long to finish.<br> Oh, no. Don't be...|Don't be silly. You know, I...<br> I'm starting to get|some feeling back in my jaw now.<br> Sex with you is really|a Kafkaesque experience.<br> Oh. Thank you.<br> I mean that as a compliment.<br> I think... I think there's too much burden|placed on the orgasm.<br> You know, to make up for|empty areas in life.<br> Who said that?<br> I don't know. I think|it may have been Leopold and Loeb.<br> Oh, hi!<br> Uh... no. What...<br> What's the matter?<br> You sound terrible.<br> No. Sure, I...<br> What kind of emergency?<br> No. Well, stay there.|I'll come over right now.<br> Just stay there. I'll come right over.<br> It's me. Open up. Are you OK?<br> What's the matter? Are you all right?<br> There's a spider in the bathroom.<br> What?<br> There's a big, black spider|in the bathroom.<br> You got me here at three in the morning|cos there's a spider in the bathroom?<br> You know how I am about insects. I can't|sleep with a live thing crawling around.<br> Kill it! What's wrong with you?|Don't you have a can of Raid?<br> I told you a thousand times. You should|always keep a lotta insect spray.<br> You never know who's gonna crawl over.<br> And a first-aid kit|and a fire-extinguisher...<br> Give me a magazine, cos I'm a little tired.<br> You make fun of me,|but I'm prepared for anything.<br> An emergency, a tidal wave,|an earthquake.<br> Hey, what is this?|Did you go to a rock concert?<br> Oh, yeah? Really?<br> How'd you like it?<br> Was it... I mean, was it heavy?|Did it achieve total heavy-ocity?<br> It was just great.<br> Why don't you get the guy|that took you to the rock concert<br> to come over and kill the spider?<br> I called you. You wanna|help me or not, huh?<br> Since when do you read|the 'National Review'?<br> - What are you turning into?|- I like to try to get all points of view.<br> Then get William F Buckley|to kill the spider.<br> Alvy, you're a little hostile.|You know that?<br> Not only that. You look thin and tired.<br> It's three o'clock in the morning!|You got me out of bed.<br> I ran over here. I couldn't get a taxi cab.|You said it was an emergency.<br> I ran up the stairs. I was a lot more|attractive when the evening began.<br> Are you going with a right-wing|rock-and-roll star?<br> Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?<br> Hey, what am I? Your son?|I came over for...<br> I got the good chocolate.<br> - Where's the spider?|- It's in the bathroom.<br> Don't squish it. And after it's dead,|flush it down the toilet a couple of times.<br> Darling, I've been killing spiders|since I was 30, OK?<br> It's a very big spider.|Lotta trouble. There's two of them.<br> I didn't think it was that big,|but it's a major spider. You got a broom?<br> It's at your house. I think I left it there.|I'm sorry. What are you doing?<br> Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom|the size of a Buick.<br> - What is this? You got black soap?|- It's for my complexion.<br> What, are you joining a minstrel show?<br> Don't worry!<br> I did it. I killed them both.|What are you sad about?<br> What did you want me to do?|Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?<br> - Oh, don't go. Please.|- What do you mean, don't...<br> What's the matter?|Are you expecting termites?<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't know. I miss you.<br> - Oh, Jesus. Really?|- Oh, yeah.<br> - Alvy?|- What?<br> Was there somebody in your room|when I called you?<br> - What do you mean?|- Was there... I thought I heard a voice.<br> I had the radio on. I'm sorry -|it was the television set.<br> I was watching...<br> Alvy, let's never break up again.<br> I don't wanna be apart.<br> I think we're both much too mature|for something like that.<br> Living together|hasn't been so bad, has it?<br> No. For me, it's been terrific. You know?<br> Better than either one of my marriages.<br> There's just something different about|you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.<br> You know, I think that if you let me,|maybe I could help you have more fun.<br> I mean, I know it's hard. It's...<br> Alvy, what about...|what if we go away this weekend?<br> Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us|would drive into Brooklyn?<br> We could show you the old|neighbourhood. That'd be fun for you.<br> Yeah, it would.<br> Oh, my God! It's a great day!<br> Watch the road!|You're gonna total the whole car!<br> I've never even been to Brooklyn.<br> I can't wait to see the old neighbourhood.|We can show her the schoolyard.<br> I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max.|The best. I was all-schoolyard.<br> They threw him a football once|and he tried to dribble it.<br> I used to lose my glasses a lot.<br> Oh, look! That's my old house.|That's where I used to live.<br> Holy cow!<br> You're lucky. Where I lived is now|a pornographic equipment store.<br> I have some very good memories there.<br> Your mother and father|fighting all the time?<br> Yeah, and always over|the most ridiculous things.<br> - You fired the cleaner?|- She stole!<br> She's coloured!|They have enough trouble!<br> - She went through my pocketbook!|- They're persecuted enough!<br> - Who's persecuting? She stole!|- So? We can afford it!<br> How can we afford it? On your pay?|What if she steals more?<br> She's a coloured woman from Harlem!|She has no money!<br> She's got a right to steal from us!|Who is she gonna steal from if not us?<br> - You're both crazy!|- They can't hear you, Max.<br> Leo, I married a fool!<br> Hey, Max. What's that?<br> That's the welcome-home party,|1945, for my cousin Herbie.<br> Look. There. That's Joey Nichols.|He was my father's friend.<br> He was always bothering me|when I was a kid.<br> Joey Nichols. See? Nickels.<br> See? Nickels.<br> You see? Nickels.|You can always remember my name.<br> Just think of Joey Five Cents.<br> That's me! Joey Five Cents!<br> What an asshole.<br> The one who killed me the most|was my mother's sister Tessie.<br> I was always the sister|with good common sense.<br> Tessie was always|the one with personality.<br> When she was younger,|they all wanted to marry Tessie.<br> Tessie Moskowitz had the personality.|She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt.<br> She was once a great beauty.<br> Tessie, they say you were|the sister with personality.<br> I was a great beauty.<br> - How did this personality come about?|- I was very charming.<br> There were many men interested in you?<br> Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.<br> That's very hard to believe.<br> Well, I had a really good day. lt was just|a real fine way to spend my birthday.<br> - Your birthday's not till tomorrow.|- But it's real close.<br> Yeah, but no presents till midnight.<br> I wonder what this is.<br> - Happy birthday.|- What is this?<br> Is this a present? Are you kidding?<br> - Yeah. Why don't you try it on?|- Yeah? I don't...<br> - This is more like a present for you.|- It'll add ten years to our sex life.<br> - Yeah. Forget it.|- Here's a real present.<br> Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?<br> - Check it out.|- Let me see.<br> OK. Let's see.<br> Oh, God!<br> You knew I wanted this.|God! It's terrific.<br> Just put on the watch and the...|and that thing and everything.<br> Oh, God. Oh.<br> Seems like<br> Old times<br> Having you<br> To walk with<br> Seems like<br> Old times<br> Having you to walk with<br> And it's still a thrill<br> Just to have my arms around you<br> Still the thrill<br> That it was the day I found you<br> Seems like<br> Old times<br> Dinner dates and flowers<br> Old times<br> Staying up all hours<br> Making dreams come true<br> Doing things we used to do<br> Seems like old times<br> Here with<br> You<br> Thank you.<br> You were sensational. I told you|if you stuck to it you would be great.<br> And... and you know...|you were sensational.<br> Well, Alvy, they were|just a terrific audience.<br> It makes it really easy for me|because I can be...<br> Excuse me.<br> Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.<br> We just wanted to stop by and say|that we really enjoyed your set.<br> Oh, yeah, really?<br> I thought it was very musical|and I liked it a lot.<br> That's really nice. Thanks a lot.<br> Are you recording? Do you...|Are you with any label now?<br> Me? No.<br> No. Not at all.<br> Well, I'd like to talk to you about that|sometime if you get a chance.<br> - Possibly working together.|- Well, that's nice.<br> Oh, listen. This is Alvy Singer.|Do you know Alvy?<br> No, but I know your work.|I'm a big fan of yours.<br> Thank you very much.<br> This is Shaun and Bob and...|Bob and Petronia.<br> Hi.<br> We're going back to the Pierre.|We're staying at the Pierre.<br> We're gonna meet Jack|and Anjelica and have a drink.<br> If you'd like to come,|we'd love to have you.<br> We can just sit and talk. Nothing...<br> Not a big deal. It's just relaxed.|It would just be very mellow.<br> Remember we have that thing.<br> What thing?<br> Don't you remember we discussed|that thing that we were... We had a...<br> Oh, the thing!<br> Yeah...<br> Oh, well, if it's inconvenient,|that's fine too. We'll do it another time.<br> Maybe if you're on the coast,|we'll get together and meet there.<br> It was a wonderful set. I really enjoyed it.<br> Nice to have met you. Good night.<br> Bye.<br> What's the matter?|You wanted to go to that party?<br> I don't know.|I thought it might be kinda fun.<br> It would be nice|to meet some new people.<br> I don't think I could take a mellow|evening. I don't respond well to mellow.<br> I have a tendency to...|If I get too mellow, I ripen and then rot.<br> It's not good for my...<br> So you don't wanna go to the party.|So what do you wanna do?<br> That was the last day I remember|really having a good time.<br> - We never have any laughs any more.|- I've been moody and dissatisfied.<br> - How often do you sleep together?|- Do you have sex often?<br> - Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.|- Constantly. I'd say three times a week.<br> - The other night Alvy wanted to have sex.|- She would not sleep with me.<br> Then... I don't know... Six months ago|I would have done it just to please him.<br> I tried everything, you know.|I put on soft music and my red light bulb.<br> But the thing is,|since our discussions here,<br> I feel I have a right to my own feelings.<br> I think you would have been happy|because I asserted myself.<br> I'm paying for her analysis. And she's|making progress and I'm getting screwed.<br> I feel so guilty because|Alvy is paying for it.<br> So I do feel guilty|if I don't go to bed with him.<br> If I do go to bed with him, it's like|I'm going against my own feelings.<br> She's making progress and I'm not.|Her progress is killing my progress.<br> Sometimes I think|I should just live with a woman.<br> I don't believe it! You mean to tell me|you guys have never snorted coke?<br> Well, I always wanted to try.|But Alvy, he's very down on it.<br> Don't put it on me. I don't wanna put|a wad of white powder in my nose.<br> There's the nasal membrane.<br> - You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.|- How can you say that?<br> I said that you, I and that girl from your|acting class should have a threesome.<br> - Well, that's sick!|- I know it's sick, but it's new.<br> You didn't say it couldn't be sick.<br> Come on, Alvy.<br> Do your body a favour. Try it.<br> I'm sure it's a lot of fun,|cos the lncas did it.<br> And they were a million laughs.<br> Come on. For your own experience.|You wanna write.<br> It's great stuff. A friend of mine|just brought it in from California.<br> Oh, you know, we're going|to California next week.<br> It's incredible. I'm thrilled, as you know.<br> On my agent's advice, I sold out|and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.<br> No. That's not it at all.|Alvy's giving an award on television.<br> You act like|you're violating a moral issue.<br> We have to leave New York|during Christmas week, which kills me.<br> Listen, while you're in California, could|you possibly score some coke for me?<br> Oh, sure. I'd be glad to. I'll just put it|in a hollow heel that I have on my boot.<br> How much is this stuff, incidentally?<br> It's about $2,000 an ounce.<br> Really? And what is the kick of it?|Cos I never...<br> I've never been so relaxed|as I have been since I moved here, Max.<br> I want you to see my house. I live next to|Hugh Hefner. He lets me use the Jacuzzi.<br> And the women are like|the women in 'Playboy' magazine,<br> only they can move their arms and legs.<br> I can't get over it -|this is really Beverly Hills.<br> The architecture's so consistent.<br> French next to Spanish|next to Tudor next to Japanese.<br> God! It's so clean out here.<br> They don't throw their garbage out.|They make it into TV shows.<br> Give us a break, Max. It's Christmas.<br> Can you believe this is Christmas?<br> It was snowing and|really grey in New York, naturally.<br> Santa Claus'll have sunstroke.<br> Max, there's no crime.|There's no mugging.<br> There's no economic crime.<br> But there's ritual religious-cult murders.|There's wheat-germ killers out here.<br> While you're out here,|I want you to see some of my TV show.<br> And we're invited|to a big Christmas party.<br> All right now, Charlie,|give me a good laugh here.<br> ..limousine to the track break down?<br> A little bigger.<br> Max, you realise how immoral this all is?<br> - Max, I got a hit series.|- I know. But you're adding fake laughs.<br> ..home so early.<br> Give me a tremendous laugh here,|Charlie.<br> We do this show live|in front of an audience.<br> And nobody laughs,|cos the jokes aren't funny.<br> That's why this machine is dynamite.<br> Honey, you'd better lie down.|You've been in the sun too long.<br> Now give me|a medium-sized chuckle here.<br> And then a big hand.<br> Is there booing on that?<br> Oh, Max.<br> I don't feel well.<br> - What's the matter?|- I don't know. I just got... very dizzy.<br> - I feel dizzy, Max.|- Well, sit down.<br> Oh, Jesus!<br> - Are you all right?|- I don't know.<br> - You wanna lie down?|- No. My stomach felt queasy all morning.<br> - How about a ginger ale?|- Oh... Max, no.<br> Maybe I'd better lie down.<br> Why don't you try to get a little|of this down? It's just plain chicken.<br> Oh, no. I can't eat this.<br> I'm nauseous.<br> If you can just give me something|to get me through the next two hours.<br> I have to go out to Burbank|and give out an award on a TV show.<br> There's nothing wrong with you,|actually, so far as I can tell.<br> You have no fever.|No symptoms of anything serious.<br> - You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.|- Excuse me. I'm sorry, doctor.<br> Alvy, that was the show.|They said everything is fine.<br> They found a replacement|so they're going to tape without you.<br> Jesus! Now I don't get to do the TV show?<br> - I know. Listen, doctor.|- I was just saying, I can't find anything.<br> - Nothing at all?|- No. I could get a lab man up here.<br> Can I have the salt, please?<br> Perhaps it would be even better|if we took him to hospital for a day or two.<br> Otherwise there's no real way|to tell what's going on.<br> This is not bad, actually.<br> Don't tell me we have to walk|from the car to the house.<br> My feet haven't touched pavement|since I reached Los Angeles.<br> I'll take a meeting with you|if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.<br> I took a meeting with Freddy.|Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.<br> All the good meetings are taken.<br> Right now it's only a notion.|But I think I can get money<br> to make it into a concept,|and then turn it into an idea.<br> Like this house, Max?<br> I even brought a map|to get us to the bathroom.<br> You should have told me|it was Tony Lacey's party.<br> What difference does that make?<br> - I think he has a thing for Annie.|- No. Unfortunately, Max,<br> - he goes with that girl over there.|- Where?<br> The one with the VPL.<br> Visible Panty Line.<br> - Max, she is gorgeous.|- Yeah, she's a ten, Max.<br> - Great for you, cos you're used to twos.|- There are no twos, Max.<br> The kind with shopping bags in Central|Park with surgical masks on, muttering.<br> How do you like this couple? They just|came back from Masters and Johnson.<br> Yeah. Intensive care ward.<br> My God. Hey, Max,|I think she's giving me the eye.<br> If she comes over,|my brain'll turn into guacamole.<br> - Hi.|- You're Alvy Singer, right?<br> - Didn't we meet at EST?|- No, I was never to EST.<br> - Then how can you criticise it?|- Oh, he didn't say anything.<br> I came out to get some shock therapy,|but there was an energy crisis.<br> - He's my food taster. Have you two met?|- How you doing?<br> - You taste to see if the food's poisoned?|- Yeah. He's crazy.<br> You guys are wearing white. lt must be|in the stars. Uri Geller must be here.<br> We're gonna operate together.<br> We just need about six weeks. ln six|weeks we could cut the whole album.<br> I don't know. This is strange to me.<br> You can come and stay here.|There's a whole wing you can have.<br> - Yeah? Stay here?|- Really. Why are you smiling?<br> I don't know.<br> Not only is he a great agent,|but he really gives good meeting.<br> This is a great house. Really.|Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.<br> You know who the original owners were?|Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.<br> - Then you know who lived here?|- Trigger.<br> Charlie Chaplin.|Right before his un-American thing.<br> That's great.<br> - But you guys are still New Yorkers.|- Yeah, I love it there.<br> I used to live there. I used to live there|for years, but... It's so dirty now.<br> I'm into garbage. It's my thing.<br> This is a really nice|screening room, Tony.<br> There's another thing about New York.<br> If you wanna see a movie, you have to|stand in line. It could be freezing.<br> We saw 'Grand Illusion' here last night.<br> Hey, that's a great film if you're high.<br> Come and see our bedroom.|We did a fantastic thing.<br> No, thanks, man. I'm cool.<br> It's wonderful. They just eat|and watch movies all day.<br> And gradually you get old and die.<br> It's important to make an effort|once in a while.<br> Do you think his girlfriend's beautiful?<br> A tad on the androgynous side,|but dynamite.<br> Yeah. I forgot my mantra.<br> That was fun.<br> I don't think California's bad at all.<br> It's a drag coming home.<br> A lot of beautiful women.<br> It was fun to flirt.<br> I have to face facts.<br> I adore Alvy, but our relationship|doesn't seem to work any more.<br> I'll have the usual trouble|with Annie in bed tonight.<br> What do I need this?<br> If only I had the nerve to break up.|But it would really hurt him.<br> If only I didn't feel guilty|asking Annie to move out.<br> It'd probably wreck her.|But I should be honest.<br> Alvy, let's face it. You know...<br> I don't think our relationship is working.<br> I know. A relationship,|I think, is like a shark.<br> It has to constantly|move forward, or it dies.<br> And I think what we got|on our hands is a dead shark.<br> Whose 'Catcher in the Rye' is this?<br> If it has my name on it,|then I guess it's mine.<br> It sure has... You wrote|your name in all my books<br> cos you knew this day was gonna come.<br> Alvy, you wanted to break up|just as much as I do.<br> No question. I think we're doing|the mature thing, without any doubt.<br> All the books on death and dying are|yours, and all the poetry books are mine.<br> 'Denial of Death'. This is the first book|that I got you. Remember that day?<br> Jeez, I feel like|there's a great weight off my back. Hm.<br> Oh. Thanks, Annie.<br> Oh, no, no, no. I mean,|I think it's really important for us<br> to explore new relationships|and stuff like that.<br> There's no question about that. Cos|we've given this a more than fair shot.<br> My analyst thinks this move is key for me.<br> And, you know, I trust her.|Because my analyst recommended her.<br> Why should I put you through|all my moods and hang-ups anyway?<br> And you know what the beauty part is?<br> - We can always get back together again.|- Exactly.<br> I don't think many couples could handle|this. Just break up and remain friends.<br> Hey, this one's mine, this button.|I guess these are all yours.<br> Impeach Eisenhower. Impeach Nixon.<br> Impeach Lyndon Johnson.|Impeach Ronald Reagan.<br> I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.<br> She's living in Los Angeles|with Tony Lacey.<br> Then the hell with her.|If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there.<br> - He's a jerk, for one thing.|- He graduated Harvard.<br> He may have... Listen, Harvard makes|mistakes too. Kissinger taught there.<br> Don't tell me you're jealous.<br> Yeah. Jealous? A little bit. Like Medea.<br> Can I show you something, lady?|I have here... I found this in the apartment.<br> Black soap. She used to wash her face|800 times a day with black soap.<br> Don't ask me why.<br> Why don't you go out with other women?<br> Well, I tried. But it's...|you know, it's very depressing.<br> This always happens to me.|Quick! Get a broom!<br> What are you making such a big deal|about? They're only lobsters.<br> You're a grown man.|You know how to pick up a lobster.<br> - I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.|- When did you quit?<br> What do you mean?<br> Mean?<br> You stopped smoking 16 years ago.|Is that what you said?<br> I don't understand.<br> Are you joking or what?<br> Central Park's turning green.<br> Yeah. I saw that lunatic|that we used to see<br> with the pinwheel hat,|you know, and the roller skates.<br> Listen, I... I want you to come back here.<br> Well... Then I'm gonna|come out there and get you.<br> What do you mean, where am l?|Where do you think I am?<br> I'm at the Los Angeles airport. I flew in.<br> I... Well, I flew in to see you.<br> Hey, listen. Can we not|debate this on the telephone?<br> Because I feel that I got a temperature.<br> And I'm getting my chronic Los Angeles|nausea already. I don't feel so good.<br> Wherever you wanna meet. I don't care.|I'll drive in. I rented a car.<br> I'm driving. What do you...<br> What, is that such a miracle?|I'm driving myself.<br> I'm gonna have the alfalfa sprouts and...<br> a plate of mashed yeast.<br> You look very pretty.<br> Oh, no. I just lost a little weight, that's all.<br> Well... you look nice.<br> I've been thinking about it,|and I think that we should get married.<br> Oh, Alvy. Come on.<br> Why? You wanna live out here?<br> It's like living in Munchkin Land.<br> What do you mean?|It's perfectly fine out here.<br> I mean, Tony's very nice.<br> And... well, I meet people|and I go to parties and we play tennis.<br> I mean, that's a very big step for me,|you know.<br> I mean, I'm able to enjoy people more.<br> So... you're not gonna|come back to New York?<br> What's so great about New York? It's|a dying city. You read 'Death in Venice'.<br> You didn't read 'Death in Venice'|till I bought it for you.<br> That's right. You only gave me books|with the word ''death'' in the title.<br> Cos it's an important issue.<br> Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life.<br> You're like New York City.|You're just this person.<br> You're like this island unto yourself.<br> I can't enjoy anything|unless everybody is.<br> If one guy is starving someplace,|that's... it puts a crimp in my evening.<br> So you wanna get married or what?<br> No. We're friends.<br> I wanna remain friends.<br> OK.<br> Check, please!<br> You're mad, aren't you?<br> Yes, of course I'm mad.|Because you love me. I know that.<br> Alvy, I can't say that that's true|at this point in my life. I really can't.<br> You know how wonderful you are.<br> You know you're the reason that I got out|of my room and that I was able to sing<br> and get more in touch|with my feelings and all that crap.<br> Anyway, look, I don't wanna...|Listen, listen, listen...<br> So what are you up to anyway, huh?<br> The usual, you know. I'm trying to write.|I'm working on a play.<br> So what are you saying? You're not|coming back to New York with me?<br> No. Look...<br> I gotta go.<br> - I flew 3,000 miles to see you.|- I'm late.<br> Air miles. You know what|that does to my stomach?<br> It's a hectic time for Tony.|The Grammies are tonight.<br> - The what?|- He's got a lot of records up for awards.<br> They give awards for that music?|I thought just earplugs.<br> Just forget it!|Let's just forget the conversation.<br> Awards! They do nothing|but give out awards! I can't believe it.<br> Greatest fascist dictator - Adolf Hitler.<br> I know what you're gonna say. I'm not a|great driver. I have some problems with...<br> Can I see your licence, please?<br> Just don't get angry or anything, cos I...<br> I have my licence here.<br> It's a rented car and I... I...<br> Here.<br> Don't give me your life...<br> story.<br> Just pick up the licence.<br> You have to ask nicely cos I've had|an extremely rough day. My girlfriend...<br> Just give me the licence, please.<br> Since you put it that way,|it's hard for me to refuse.<br> I have a terrific problem with authority.<br> It's not your fault. Don't take it personal.<br> So long, fellas. Keep in touch.<br> Imagine my surprise|when I got your call, Max.<br> Yeah. I had the feeling|that I got you at a bad moment.<br> I heard high-pitched squealing.<br> Twins, Max.<br> Can you imagine|the mathematical possibilities of that?<br> You're an actor, Max. You should be|doing Shakespeare in the Park.<br> I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.|I got mugged.<br> I was playing Richard II, and two guys|with leather jackets stole my leotard.<br> Max, are we driving through plutonium?<br> It keeps out the alpha rays, Max.<br> You don't get old.<br> You're a thinking person.|How can you choose this lifestyle?<br> What is so incredibly great|about New York?<br> It's a dying city.|You read 'Death in Venice'.<br> You didn't read it till I gave it to you.<br> You only give me books|with ''death'' in the title.<br> - It's an important issue.|- You are totally incapable of enjoying life.<br> You're like New York. You're an island.<br> OK. lf that's all that we've been|through together means to you,<br> I guess it's better if we just|say goodbye, once and for all.<br> You know, it's funny, after all the serious|talks and passionate moments,<br> that it ends here, in a health-food|restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.<br> Goodbye, Sunny.<br> Wait.<br> I'm gonna go with you.<br> I love you.<br> What do you want? lt was my first play.<br> You know how you're always trying to|get things to come out perfect in art<br> because it's real difficult in life.<br> Interestingly, however,|I did run into Annie again.<br> It was on the Upper West Side|of Manhattan.<br> She had moved back to New York.|She was living in SoHo with some guy.<br> And when I met her, she was dragging|him in to see The Sorrow and the Pity,<br> which I counted as a personal triumph.<br> Annie and I had lunch|sometime after that and...<br> just kicked around old times.<br> Just to have my arms<br> Around you<br> Still the thrill that it was<br> The day I found you<br> Seems like<br> Old times<br> Dinner dates and flowers<br> Old times<br> After that, it got pretty late|and we both had to go.<br> But it was great seeing Annie again.|I realised what a terrific person she was<br> and how much fun it was|just knowing her.<br> And I thought of that old joke, you know.<br> This guy goes to a psychiatrist and says,<br> ''Doc, my brother's crazy.|He thinks he's a chicken. ''<br> And the doctor says,|''Well, why don't you turn him in?''<br> And the guy says,|''I would, but I need the eggs. ''<br> Well, I guess that's pretty much now|how I feel about relationships.<br> You know, they're totally irrational|and crazy and absurd and...<br> But I guess we keep going through it|because most of us need the eggs.<br>
