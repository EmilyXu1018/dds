Kurtz's|memory...<br> any more than being back|in Saigon was an accident.<br> There is no way|to tell his story<br> without telling my own,<br> and if his story|is really a confession,<br> then so is mine.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Stand at ease.<br> Want a cigarette?<br> No, thank you, sir.<br> Captain, have you ever seen|this gentleman before?<br> No, sir.<br> Met the general or myself?<br> No, sir.<br> Not personally.<br> You've worked a lot|on your own?<br> Yes, sir, I have.<br> Your report specifies|intelligence with Com-Sec.<br> I'm not disposed to|discuss those operations.<br> Did you not work|for the CIA and I Corps?<br> No, sir.<br> Did you not assassinate<br> a government|tax collector,<br> Quang Tri province,|June 18, 1968?<br> Captain?<br> Sir, I'm unaware of<br> any such activity|or operation...<br> nor would I be disposed<br> to discuss|such an operation<br> if it did|in fact exist, sir.<br> I thought we'd have lunch|while we talk.<br> I hope you brought|a good appetite, Captain.<br> I noticed that you|have a bad hand there.<br> Are you wounded?<br> A little|fishing accident<br> on R and R, sir.<br> Fishing on R and R?<br> Yes, sir.<br> But you're|ready for duty?<br> Yes, General.<br> Very much so, sir.<br> Well, let's see|what we have here.<br> Roast beef.<br> Usually|it's not bad.<br> Try some, Jerry,|and pass it around.<br> To save a little time,|we might pass both ways.<br> Uh...
