                        We have the crew crossing gantry<br> for capsule ingress.<br> Roger that.<br> Inspired by the late President Kennedy,<br> in only seven years, America has risen<br> to the challenge of what he called...<br> "the most hazardous and dangerous<br> and greatest adventure...<br> on which man has ever embarked."<br> After trailing the Russians for years<br> with our manned space program,<br> - We got a short!<br> - And after that sudden, horrible fire...<br> on the launchpad<br> during a routine test...<br> - that killed astronauts Gus Grissom...<br> - Fire in the cockpit!<br> - Ed White and Roger Chaffee...<br> - Get us outta here!<br> There were serious doubts that we<br> could beat the Russians to the moon.<br> But tonight, a mere 18 months<br> after the tragedy of Apollo 1...<br> the entire world watched in awe<br> as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...<br> landed on the moon.<br> The big news came<br> just a moment ago.<br> Mission Control gave<br> the spacecraft permission...<br> to go for<br> the extravehicular activity...<br> that is, for the walk<br> on the moon...<br> far earlier than anticipated,<br> Important thing when you're penetrating<br> the lunar module is your attitude...<br> and your relative speed.<br> Let's say this is me in the command<br> module and this is you...<br> - All right.<br> - In the LEM.<br> This thing sticks out.<br> That's called a probe.<br> - Is that true?<br> - Absolutely.<br> Tracey, when you feel that thing<br> slide in, everything's clickin'...<br> it's like no other<br> feeling in the world.<br> - A little liquid propulsion.<br> - What's the big occasion?<br> How's it goin' at Mission Control?<br> It's a nervous time. They're pacin'<br> around, smokin' like chimneys.<br> Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.<br> Jim Lovell.<br> - Hi.<br> - This is Tracey.<br> - How do ya do, Tracey?<br> - This is the man.<br> Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.<br> They were the first around the moon.<br> This guy did ten laps.<br> With one hand on the wheel.<br> Make yourselves at home.<br> - Hey, Marilyn.<br> - Where have you been?<br> This is the last champagne<br> in Houston.<br> - Very good. Very good.<br> - Everything else all right?<br> - Everything's on course.<br> - Looks okay. Hey! Cadet Lovell.<br> - Hey, Dad.<br> - Put this on ice. Make sure it's cold.<br> - You gonna get a haircut this week?<br> - I'm on vacation.<br> Oh, get a haircut.<br> Well, hello there.<br> - I wouldn't mind bein' up there tonight.<br> - God, who wouldn't.<br> Don't worry. Our day's comin'.<br> They're not gonna cut<br> the program before number 14.<br> - You know, my cousin called.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> Asked who we bribed<br> to get on Jim Lovell's crew.<br> Yeah.<br> I told him they wanted<br> to make sure he got the best.<br> Well, they got that right.<br> - What network do we want?<br> - Come on! Walt! Hey! Put on Walter!<br> - Walter!<br> - Jules Bergman!<br> John, turn it up!<br> ...has completed putting on<br> the spacesuits and the boots.<br> I, uh... I really appreciate you all<br> coming to this dress rehearsal party...<br> for my Apollo 12 landing.<br> Sit down, Conrad.<br> I think we should all take<br> a moment to recognize...<br> the exemplary...<br> hell, damn near heroic...<br> effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's<br> backup for this historic moon walk...<br> and, of course, his crew.<br> Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,<br> Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.<br> There he is! There he is!<br> Everybody quiet down!<br> Hey! Kids!<br> We had a good touchdown.<br> We can verify the position of the<br> opening I ought to have on the camera.<br> What?<br> - Think it's too late for him to abort?<br> - He still has time to get out.<br> He just needs somebody to wave him off.<br> Pull up, Neil!<br> Pull up! Pull up!<br> Okay, Neil, we can see you<br> coming down the ladder now.<br> Look at those pictures. Wow.<br> I'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder.<br> The LEM footpads are only depressed<br> in the surface about, uh...<br> one or two inches.<br> - It's almost like a powder.<br> - Armstrong is on the moon.<br> Neil Armstrong,<br> standing on the surface<br> of the moon...<br> on this July 20, 1969.<br> That's one small step for man...<br> one giant leap for mankind.<br> His quote was...<br> "That's one small step for man,<br> one giant leap for mankind."<br> Somewhere<br> Beyond the sea<br> Somewhere waitin' for me<br> - You're drunk, Lovell.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm not used to the champagne.<br> Me neither.<br> I can't deal with cleaning up.<br> Let's sell the house.<br> All right, let's sell the house.<br> They're back inside now<br> lookin' up at us.<br> Isn't that somethin'?<br> I bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't<br> get a wink of sleep tonight.<br> When you were on the far side on 8,<br> I didn't sleep at all.<br> I just vacuumed<br> over and over again.<br> Christopher Columbus,<br> Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.<br> Neil Armstrong.<br> From now on, we live in a world<br> where man has walked on the moon.<br> It's not a miracle.<br> We just decided to go.<br> On Apollo 8, we were so close...<br> just 60 nautical miles down and...<br> It was like I could just...<br> step out and walk<br> on the face of it.<br> I want to go back there.<br> Where's my mountain?<br> Well, it... Up there.<br> It's, uh, right up by the...<br> It's... Okay, do you see<br> where the shadow crosses...<br> the white area there?<br> That's the Sea of Tranquility...<br> and your mountain's right there<br> on the edge of that.<br> It's your mountain.<br> Your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.<br> I don't see it.<br> Well, you gotta look harder.<br> You... You... You look harder...<br> - Jim.<br> - While I...<br> Jim!<br> Groovin'<br> Down a crowded avenue<br> The astronaut is only<br> the most visible member...<br> of a very large team, and all of us<br> down to the guy sweeping the floor...<br> are honored to be a part of it.<br> What did the man say? "Give me a lever<br> long enough and I'll move the world"?<br> That's what we're doing here.<br> This is divine inspiration.<br> It's the best part of each one of us,<br> the belief that anything is possible.<br> Things like a computer<br> that can fit into a single room...<br> and hold millions of pieces<br> of information...<br> or the Saturn 5 rocket.<br> This is the actual launch vehicle<br> that will be taking Alan Shepard...<br> and his crew on the first leg<br> of the Apollo 13 mission.<br> When are you<br> going up again, Jim?<br> I'm slated to be the commander<br> of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.<br> If there is an Apollo 14.<br> Jim, people in my state have been<br> asking why we're continuing...<br> to fund this program now that we've<br> beaten the Russians to the moon.<br> Imagine if Christopher Columbus<br> had come back from the new world...<br> and no one returned<br> in his footsteps.<br> Attention, all personnel.<br> Clear level three.<br> Are there any other questions?<br> How do you go<br> to the bathroom in space?<br> Well, I tell you,<br> it's a highly technical process...<br> of cranking down the window and<br> looking for a gas station, which, uh...<br> Oh, there's Deke Slayton.<br> Deke, you might be able<br> to answer this lady's question.<br> Deke is one of the original Mercury<br> seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Now he's our boss. He hands out<br> the astronauts' flight assignments...<br> so naturally we kick back<br> part of our salaries to Deke.<br> - How much this month?<br> - Can I have a minute?<br> Something's come up.<br> Sure, you b... Uh, Henry?<br> Hey!<br> - Anybody home?<br> - I'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!<br> You don't understand!<br> I worked so hard on this!<br> Maybe I don't understand...<br> but you are not wearing that<br> out in this neighborhood.<br> She's not even wearing a bra!<br> You can see everything!<br> Shut up!<br> - Everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.<br> - Jim.<br> You know that Easter vacation trip<br> we had planned for Acapulco?<br> Uh-oh.<br> I was thinkin' there might be<br> a slight change in destination.<br> Really?<br> Maybe, say... the moon.<br> Al Shepard's ear infection<br> has flared up...<br> and we've all been bumped up<br> to the prime crew of Apollo 13.<br> Straight to the head of the line<br> and the Fra Mauro highlands.<br> Six months?<br> You're moving up six months?<br> - Dad, can I please wear this?<br> - Sure.<br> - Jim.<br> - No! No. Absolutely not.<br> - Don't you want somebody to love<br> - This stinks!<br> They're not rushing things, are they?<br> You're gonna be ready<br> in six months?<br> We'll be ready. Boy, I wouldn't want<br> to be around Al Shepard tonight.<br> I gotta get over there.<br> We're gonna have to get up to speed.<br> Go. Go.<br> I'm gonna walk<br> on the moon, Marilyn.<br> I know. I can't believe it.<br> Naturally, it's 13.<br> Why 13?<br> It comes after 12, hon.<br> Apollo 13, you are go for docking.<br> All systems are nominal<br> and on the line.<br> Okay, S-4B is stable,<br> slot panels are drifting free.<br> The drogue is clear.<br> The docking target is clear.<br> Okay, I'm comin' up on that now.<br> Two... one... mark.<br> Seventy-five feet.<br> We're comin' up on docking.<br> Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.<br> We'll see what he does.<br> Whoa. Wait a minute.<br> I lost something here.<br> I can't translate up.<br> Houston, we are drifting<br> down and away.<br> - Wanna back off and take another run?<br> - No, I got it.<br> Let me just try<br> and get it stable here.<br> - I'm gonna reset the high gain.<br> - Got the target back in the reticle.<br> We're stable.<br> Go ahead and recycle the valves.<br> - Forty feet.<br> - They're all gray.<br> Twenty.<br> - Easy.<br> - Ten feet.<br> - Capture.<br> - That's it!<br> - That's it.<br> - Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.<br> - Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.<br> - Man, that woke me up.<br> Apollo 13 backup crew,<br> you're up in the simulator.<br> - Nice job, gentlemen.<br> - That's three hours of boredom...<br> followed by seven seconds<br> of sheer terror.<br> Good job, guys.<br> You just won the Christmas turkey.<br> Nice try, Frank.<br> You really outfoxed 'em, brother.<br> Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.<br> Used up too much fuel.<br> You're above the curve.<br> Not by much. Listen, guys,<br> I wanna work it again.<br> Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol<br> headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?<br> - Wheels up at 0700.<br> - Yeah, I know...<br> but my rate of turn<br> is still a little slow.<br> I really think<br> we should work it again.<br> - Well, let's get it right.<br> - Okay, set it up again, Frank.<br> Okay, 13 backup crew.<br> It'll have to wait.<br> - Prime crew's up for another run.<br> - Yeah, baby.<br> Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...<br> and all systems are nominal.<br> Fred, set the S-band omni to B...<br> and when you get<br> in the LEM, two forward.<br> Good shape over here.<br> Hey, we got a problem.<br> - Ken, get your helmet on!<br> - I can't get it locked!<br> Oh, God!<br> Jim!<br> I thought the stars<br> would fall down on you.<br> That's silly.<br> Stars can't fall on us.<br> You're a smarter kid than I was.<br> How long will it take<br> to get to the moon?<br> Four days.<br> But that's pretty fast.<br> See, this is<br> the Saturn 4B booster...<br> and it shoots us<br> away from the Earth...<br> as fast as a bullet from a gun...<br> until the moon's gravity<br> actually grabs us and pulls us...<br> into a circle around the moon...<br> which is called an orbit.<br> All right?<br> Fred and I float down the tunnel<br> into the lunar module...<br> this spidery-Iookin' guy.<br> Only holds two people,<br> and it's just for landin' on the moon.<br> And I take the controls<br> and I steer it around...<br> and I fly it down...<br> adjustin' it here,<br> the attitude there, pitch, roll...<br> for a nice, soft landing<br> on the moon.<br> Better than Neil Armstrong.<br> Way better than Pete Conrad.<br> Dad... did you know<br> the astronauts in the fire?<br> Yeah. Yeah, I did. I knew the<br> astronauts in the fire. All of 'em.<br> Could that happen again?<br> Well, I'll tell ya<br> somethin' about that fire.<br> Um, a lot of things went wrong.<br> The, uh... The door.<br> It's called the hatch. They couldn't<br> get it open when they needed to get out.<br> That was one thing. And, uh...<br> Well, a lot of things<br> went wrong in that fire.<br> Did they fix it?<br> Oh, yes. Absolutely.<br> We fixed it.<br> It's not a problem anymore.<br> I can't believe they still<br> have you doing public appearances.<br> Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.<br> I know. But with a training<br> schedule this tight...<br> Well, it's... It's the program, Marilyn.<br> You know, it's NASA.<br> Hey! Hey, you're<br> Jim Lovell, aren't ya?<br> Hey! Lucky 13!<br> Right on!<br> That's the second time<br> it's done that.<br> I was looking at the kids'<br> school schedule coming up.<br> Yeah?<br> - It's a very busy week.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm thinking about<br> not going to the launch.<br> Huh.<br> The kids need me at home, honey.<br> Marilyn, we've had<br> these kids for awhile now.<br> They've never kept you from<br> comin' to the other launches.<br> But now we have your mother.<br> She's just had this stroke.<br> Mom's fine.<br> It's not like I've<br> never been to a launch.<br> The other wives<br> have not done three.<br> I just don't think<br> I can go through all that.<br> I'll just be glad<br> when this one's over.<br> Well, you're gonna miss<br> a hell of a show.<br> - Jim.<br> - Hey, guys. See ya in a few weeks.<br> Take care.<br> Bring us back a moon rock.<br> So the number 13<br> doesn't bother you.<br> Only if it's a Friday, Phil.<br> Apollo 13, lifting off<br> at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...<br> and entering the moon's<br> gravity on April 13?<br> Uh, Ken Mattingly here has been<br> doing some scientific experiments...<br> regarding that very phenomenon,<br> haven't you?<br> Uh, yes. Well, I had a black cat,<br> uh, walk over a broken mirror...<br> under the lunar module ladder.<br> It didn't seem to be a problem.<br> We're considering a letter<br> we got from a fella...<br> who said we oughta take<br> a pig with us for good luck.<br> Does it bother you that the public<br> regards this flight as routine?<br> There's nothing routine about flying<br> to the moon. I can vouch for that.<br> And, uh, I think that<br> an astronaut's last mission...<br> his final flight... that's always<br> going to be very special.<br> Why is this your last, Jim?<br> I'm in command<br> of the best ship...<br> with the best crew<br> that anybody could ask for...<br> and I'll be walking in a place<br> where there's 400 degrees difference...<br> between sunlight and shadow.<br> I can't imagine, uh,<br> ever topping that.<br> We have that scheduled<br> for 0900 hours tomorrow.<br> - That's not gonna work, Walter.<br> - Why?<br> Freddo and I are gonna be goin' over the<br> lunar surface experiments tomorrow...<br> and Ken's gonna be<br> back in the simulator.<br> We're gonna be goin' over<br> the flight plan tonight.<br> Gonna pay a visit to this machine<br> after you're hard down. Thanks.<br> Jim, we've got a problem.<br> We just got some blood work back from<br> the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.<br> So we need a new backup.<br> - You've all been exposed to it.<br> - Oh, I've had the measles.<br> Ken Mattingly hasn't.<br> You wanna break up my crew<br> two days before the launch...<br> when we can predict each other's moves,<br> read the tone of each other's voices?<br> Ken Mattingly will be<br> getting seriously ill...<br> precisely when you and Haise will<br> be ascending from the lunar surface.<br> That's a lousy time for a fever.<br> Jack Swigert has been<br> out of the loop for weeks.<br> He's fully qualified<br> to fly this mission.<br> He's a fine pilot, but when was<br> the last time he was in a simulator?<br> I'm sorry, Jim.<br> I understand how you feel.<br> We can do one of two things.<br> We can either scrub Mattingly<br> and go with Swigert...<br> or we can bump all three of you<br> to a later mission.<br> I've trained<br> for the Fra Mauro highlands...<br> and this is flight surgeon<br> horseshit, Deke!<br> Jim, if you hold out for Ken,<br> you will not be on Apollo 13.<br> It's your decision.<br> Oh, let it ring.<br> Listen, I-I gotta take that.<br> - Oh, why?<br> - Because I'm on the backup crew...<br> and the backup crew has to set up<br> the guest list and book the hotel room.<br> Swigert. Yeah.<br> I looked all around<br> Yes. Yes, sir.<br> Uh-uh, I understand.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Why don't you come with me, little girl<br> On a magic carpet ride<br> Well, you don't know<br> what we can see<br> Why don't you tell<br> your dreams to me<br> Well, I, uh...<br> Damn.<br> Medical guys.<br> I had a feeling when they started doing<br> all the blood tests that, uh...<br> I mean, I know it's their ass if I get<br> sick up there, but, I mean... Jesus!<br> Oh, boy.<br> Swigert, he'll be fine. He's, uh...<br> He's strong.<br> It'll be a hell of a mission.<br> One for the books.<br> You sure about this?<br> Why don't I talk to Deke?<br> I'm sure we can work this out.<br> This was my call.<br> Must've been a tough one.<br> Look, I don't have the measles.<br> I'm not gonna get the measles.<br> Shit. Ken, wait up.<br> Trajectory is holding steady.<br> We're right on the line.<br> We're into program 64. We're in 05 Gs,<br> so we're feeling that gravity now.<br> Houston, we are at 400,000 feet<br> passing entry interphase.<br> About to lose signal.<br> Reentry data is nominal,<br> and we have radio blackout.<br> What's the story here?<br> I got a corridor light.<br> We're comin' in too shallow.<br> I'm goin' to manual.<br> - Houston, switching to S.C.S.<br> - Roger, Thirteen.<br> Okay, we're at three Gs.<br> Five Gs.<br> We're comin' in too steep.<br> I'm gonna stay in this roll,<br> see if I can pull us out.<br> We're at eight Gs.<br> Nine. Ten.<br> - We're at 12 Gs.<br> - Twelve Gs. We're burnin' up.<br> Damn it!<br> I gave 'em a false indicator light<br> at entry interphase.<br> Even Mattingly didn't<br> get it the first time.<br> How ya feelin', Freddo?<br> Char-broiled.<br> So what happened?<br> Came in too steep. We're dead.<br> - No shit.<br> - Yeah, we were into program 67 there.<br> Okay, we're gonna<br> do this again, obviously...<br> but give us a minute<br> to get our switches reset.<br> Jim, could we have a word?<br> Oh, sure, Deke.<br> We're going to drop off line<br> and debrief.<br> - So?<br> - Well...<br> if I had a dollar for every time<br> they killed me in this thing...<br> I wouldn't have<br> to work for you, Deke.<br> Well, we have two days.<br> We'll be ready.<br> Let's do it again.<br> Do it again.<br> Margaret, get them!<br> Fred, Stephen, come here!<br> - Daddy!<br> - Watch out! You'll fall!<br> We can't go across that road.<br> We don't want Daddy to get our germs<br> and get sick in outer space.<br> Hey, boys. Not givin' your mom<br> a hard time, are ya?<br> Princess, you look beautiful.<br> Jack!<br> Well, hey, that looks<br> like Marilyn Lovell.<br> But it can't be.<br> She's not coming to the launch.<br> I heard it was gonna be<br> a hell of a show.<br> Who told you that?<br> Some guy I know.<br> You can't live without me.<br> Okay, folks.<br> Let's say good night.<br> - We got a big day tomorrow.<br> - Good night!<br> You hear about Ken?<br> Yeah.<br> One, two.<br> Stand back, please.<br> Ah, Guenter Wendt.<br> I wonder where Guenter went?<br> Jim.<br> - You walk on ze moon, ja?<br> - Ja. Ja, we walk and...<br> and we talk on ze moon.<br> How do you feel? Pretty good?<br> Good. Might be a little<br> warmer in here, huh?<br> - How are you today? Ready?<br> - Good. Yeah.<br> Oh! Oh! Jeez! Oh!<br> Oh, God, no!<br> Oh, no.<br> - Okay, we have the oxygen burn system?<br> - Check.<br> - We have the helmet restraint ring?<br> - Check.<br> Communication umbilical on.<br> - Fred.<br> - What?<br> - Gum.<br> - Aw, sorry.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm gonna give these guys<br> a beautiful ride.<br> Sure you will, Jack.<br> You need more air?<br> You want some apple?<br> - Marilyn, hey!<br> - Mary.<br> Aw, I hate this already.<br> You're not just about to pop,<br> are you?<br> No. I got 30 days<br> 'til this blast-off.<br> This is for Gene.<br> Mrs. Kranz has pulled out<br> the needle and thread again.<br> The last one looked like<br> he bought it off a gypsy.<br> Well, you can't argue with tradition.<br> Copy that.<br> This is from your wife, Gene.<br> Thank you, Tom.<br> I was startin' to get worried.<br> There we go.<br> - I like it. I like that one, Gene.<br> - Sharp, Gene.<br> Jim, you're all set.<br> Very sharp.<br> Hey, Gene, I guess we can go now.<br> Save it for splashdown, guys.<br> Apollo 13 flight controllers,<br> listen up.<br> Give me a go,<br> no go for launch.<br> - Booster.<br> - Go.<br> - RETRO.<br> - Go.<br> - FIDO.<br> - We're go, Flight.<br> - Guidance.<br> - Guidance go.<br> - Surgeon.<br> - Go, Flight.<br> - EECOM.<br> - We're go, Flight.<br> - GNC.<br> - We're go.<br> - TELMU.

Recovery.<br> - Go.<br> - Go.<br> - CAPCOM.<br> - We're go, Flight.<br> Launch Control, this is Houston.<br> We are go for launch.<br> Roger that, Houston.<br> Pad leader, what's your status?<br> We are go for launch.<br> T minus 60 seconds and counting.<br> - Stand by.<br> - Roger.<br> Fuel pumps.<br> This is it. A few bumps<br> and we're haulin' the mail.<br> Control, this is Guidance.<br> They're ready for takeoff.<br> We are go for launch.<br> - T minus...<br> - 15... 14...<br> ten... nine...<br> eight... seven...<br> six... ignition sequence starts...<br> three... two... one...<br> ignition!<br> The clock is running!<br> We have lift-off!<br> Houston, we have cleared<br> the tower at 1313.<br> Okay, guys, we got it.<br> Come on, baby. Come on.<br> Altitude is on the line.<br> Velocity right on the line.<br> Roll complete. We are pitching.<br> Thirteen, stand by<br> for mode one Bravo.<br> FIDO, how we lookin'?<br> Looks good, Flight.<br> Right down the middle.<br> We see your B.P.C.<br> Is clear, Thirteen.<br> Roger. E.D.S. To manual.<br> Inboard.<br> Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.<br> That was some little jolt.<br> Tower jett.<br> Houston, we've got a center engine<br> cutoff. Go on the other four.<br> Roger that, Thirteen.<br> We show the same.<br> Booster, can you<br> confirm that cutoff?<br> - Roger. Looks like we lost it.<br> - FIDO, what's that going to do?<br> Stand by, Flight.<br> I need to know if the I.U.'s<br> correcting for the shutdown.<br> Houston, what's the story<br> on engine five?<br> We're still go. We'll be all right<br> as long as we don't lose another one.<br> - Roger that.<br> - Thirteen, we're not sure<br> why the inboard was out...<br> but the other engines are go,<br> so we're gonna burn those engines...<br> a little bit longer.<br> Roger that.<br> Our gimbals are good.<br> Our trim is good.<br> Looks like we just had<br> our glitch for this mission.<br> - 13, stand by for staging.<br> - Roger that.<br> S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.<br> Thrust looks good, Flight.<br> Flight, S-4B cutoff<br> in ten seconds.<br> Thirteen, this is Houston.<br> Predicted cutoff is 12 plus 34, over.<br> Coming up on 12 minutes 34.<br> - And...<br> - SECO!<br> Shutdown.<br> And that, gentlemen,<br> is how we do that.<br> Oh, boy. Hope I can sleep.<br> Mom, that was loud.<br> Here, hold my hand.<br> I can't believe<br> you did this four times.<br> The worst part's over.<br> It is?<br> Listen, this doesn't stop for me<br> until he lands on that aircraft carrier.<br> Well, you just look<br> so calm about it.<br> If the flight surgeon had to okay me<br> for this mission, I'd be grounded.<br> Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!<br> Can we speak to you?<br> Can we just have<br> a word with you?<br> Remember, you're proud,<br> happy and thrilled.<br> Mrs. Lovell!<br> - How're ya feeling?<br> - Well, very proud...<br> and very happy,<br> and we're thrilled.<br> Flight, Booster.<br> I show S-4B shutdown.<br> T.L.I. Is on the money.<br> Looks good, Flight.<br> Roger, FIDO.<br> Okay, guys.<br> We're goin' to the moon.<br> Flight, we have reacquisition<br> of signal at Hawaii.<br> Flight, everything looks good.<br> Okay, Houston. C.M.P. Here.<br> I've exchanged couches with Jim.<br> I'm in the pilot's seat.<br> I'm gonna go ahead and get set<br> for transposition and docking.<br> Roger that, Jack.<br> Freddo, you okay?<br> Okay, let's get turned around<br> and pick up the lunar module.<br> Odyssey, you're go<br> for pyro arm and docking,<br> and we recommend you secure<br> cabin pressurization.<br> Roger that.<br> Okay, we're ready<br> for C.S.M. Separation.<br> Okay, S.M.R.C.S.<br> Isol valves are all gray.<br> Okay, Swigert,<br> command module pilot...<br> she's all yours.<br> Houston, we've got<br> a good separation.<br> - The S-4B is stable.<br> - Translation looks good.<br> - We confirm that, Thirteen.<br> - We're gonna start to pitch around...<br> to line up with the LEM.<br> You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...<br> was upchuckin' most of the way<br> to the moon on Apollo 8.<br> I'm all right. I just ate too much<br> breakfast. Let's go to work.<br> And pitching up.<br> Pitch rate,<br> Roger, Jack.<br> We see you pitching around.<br> Keep an eye on that telemetry.<br> Roger that. If Swigert can't dock<br> this thing, we don't have a mission.<br> - How's the alignment?<br> - G.D.C. Align.<br> Thrusting forward.<br> One hundred feet.<br> Watch the alignment, now.<br> Ah, don't worry, guys.<br> I'm on top of it.<br> - FIDO, let me know when you're ready.<br> - Okay, let's uplink that.<br> - How we lookin'?<br> - We're not there yet. Forty feet.<br> Twenty.<br> Come on, rookie,<br> park that thing.<br> Ten feet.<br> - Capture.<br> - That's it.<br> - Talk back is barber pole.<br> - Go ahead and retract.<br> Houston, we have hard dock.<br> Roger, understand.<br> That's a good deal, Jack.<br> Let's start back up with procedure 17.<br> Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.<br> We copy that, Thirteen.<br> Now you're off<br> to the Fra Mauro highlands.<br> - I gotta get out of this suit.<br> - Houston, we are ready...<br> for the beginning<br> of the P.T. C...<br> and I think once we're in that<br> barbecue roll, uh, Jack and I will eat.<br> - Hey, I'm hungry.<br> - Are you sure?<br> I could eat the ass<br> out of a dead rhinoceros.<br> - We got a smooth one, huh?<br> - By the numbers so far.<br> We just ran a minimum load test on the<br> cooling system. Let me clean this up.<br> - See you tomorrow.<br> - Take care.<br> It's too bad we can't<br> demonstrate this on TV.<br> What a shame.<br> Okay. Overboard dump comin' up.<br> Here it comes...<br> the constellation Urion.<br> Now, that's a beautiful sight.<br> Barbara. Barbara, we are going<br> to your father's broadcast.<br> No! I'm never coming out!<br> I hate Paul! No one else<br> can ever play their records again!<br> She's still going on about<br> the stupid Beatles breaking up?<br> - They're not stupid! You're stupid!<br> - Barbara!<br> I know you're in mourning.<br> I'm not going, Mom!<br> Dad won't know if we're there!<br> The whole world is going to be watching<br> this broadcast, and so are we.<br> Excuse me while I...<br> Okay, uh, good evening, America...<br> and welcome aboard Apollo 13.<br> I'm Jim Lovell, and we're<br> broadcasting to you tonight...<br> from an altitude of almost<br> away from the face<br> of the earth...<br> and we have a pretty good show<br> in store for you tonight.<br> We are going<br> to show you just what...<br> - Susan. Barbara.<br> - Our life is like for the three of us...<br> - in the vast expanse of outer space.<br> - Double!<br> One of the first things<br> we'd like to do...<br> is provide you with the<br> appropriate background music.<br> So, uh, hit it there, Freddo.<br> Hello, world!<br> That, uh, was supposed<br> to be the theme to 2001...<br> in honor of<br> our command module Odyssey...<br> but there seems to have been<br> a change in the program.<br> When I go up on 19, I'm gonna take my<br> entire collection of Johnny Cash along.<br> - Hey, Marilyn.<br> - Where's their broadcast?<br> All the networks dumped us.<br> One of them said we made<br> goin' to the moon...<br> as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.<br> My son's supposed to be on.<br> He's in outer space.<br> This is all the channels<br> we get, Mrs. Lovell.<br> It's that damn TV Guide again.<br> Ruthless porters.<br> Savage baggage masters...<br> When I was just a lad of ten<br> My father said to me<br> - Come here and take...<br> - Do they know they're not on the air?<br> We'll tell them<br> when they get back.<br> Don't put your faith<br> in love, my boy<br> My father said to me<br> Uh, well, if anyone from the,<br> uh, I.R.S. Is watching...<br> I forgot to file my 1040 return.<br> I meant to do it today, but, uh...<br> That's no joke.<br> They'll jump on him.<br> Well, folks, let's head on down<br> to the lunar excursion module.<br> Follow me.<br> Now, when we get ready<br> to land on the moon...<br> Fred Haise and I will float<br> through this access tunnel...<br> into the lunar module, leaving...<br> EECOM, that stir's gonna be...<br> on both H2 and both O2 tanks,<br> is that correct?<br> ...the spacecraft<br> will remain connected.<br> Well, folks, as you can<br> probably tell...<br> the Aquarius isn't much bigger<br> than a couple of telephone booths.<br> The skin of the LEM<br> in some places...<br> is only as...<br> as thick as a couple of layers...<br> of tinfoil, and that's all that<br> protects us from the vacuum of space.<br> We get away with this because the LEM is<br> designed only for flight in outer space.<br> Fred Haise, Renaissance man.<br> Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now<br> and back into the Odyssey.<br> When you and your baby<br> have a fallin' out<br> All right, we've returned to the...<br> Stand by one, Houston.<br> Gotcha!<br> Houston, that bang you heard was<br> Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.<br> He gets our hearts goin'<br> every time with that one.<br> We'll go honky tonkin'<br> 'round this town<br> Okay, we're, uh, about<br> to close out the Aquarius...<br> and, uh, return to the Odyssey.<br> Our next broadcast will be from<br> Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.<br> So, uh, this is the crew<br> of the Apollo 13...<br> wishing everyone<br> back on Earth a...<br> a pleasant evening.<br> All right.<br> Daddy was funny.<br> They might air a few minutes<br> of it on the news tonight.<br> You'd think so.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Well, between Jack's back taxes<br> and the Fred Haise Show...<br> I'd say that was a pretty<br> successful broadcast.<br> - That was an excellent show.<br> - Thank you very much, Houston.<br> We've got a couple of<br> housekeeping procedures.<br> We'd like you to roll right<br> to 0-6-0 and null your rates.<br> Roger that.<br> Rolling right, 0-6-0.<br> And then if you could give<br> your oxygen tanks a stir.<br> Roger that.<br> Hey, we've got a problem here.<br> - What did you do?<br> - Nothing. I stirred the tanks.<br> - Whoa!<br> - Hey!<br> Uh, this is Houston.<br> Say again please.<br> Houston, we have a problem.<br> We have a main bus B undervolt.<br> - We've got a lot<br> of thruster activity here.<br> - What's with the computer now?<br> It just went off line.<br> There's another master alarm.<br> - I'm checking the quad.<br> - That was no repress valve.<br> - Maybe it's in quad C.<br> I'm gonna reconfigure the R.C.S.<br> - We've got a computer restart.<br> - We've got a ping light.<br> - The way these are firing<br> doesn't make sense.<br> We've got multiple caution and warning,<br> Houston. We've got to reset and restart.<br> I'm going to S.C.S.<br> Jesus. Flight, their<br> heart rates are skyrocketing.<br> - EECOM, what's your data telling you?<br> - O2 tank two not reading at all.<br> Tank one is at 725 psi<br> and falling.<br> Fuel cells one and three<br> are, uh...<br> Oh, boy, what's going on here?<br> Flight, let me get back to you.<br> Flight, GNC.<br> They're all over the place.<br> - They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.<br> - I keep losing radio signal.<br> Flight, their antennae<br> must be flipped around.<br> They're gonna have to do it<br> manually if they do it at all.<br> One at a time, people.<br> Is this an instrumentation problem<br> or are we looking at real power loss?<br> It's reading a quadruple failure.<br> That can't happen.<br> It's got to be<br> instrumentation.<br> Let's get the hatch buttoned.<br> The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.<br> The tunnel's really torquin'<br> with all this movement.<br> Houston, we had a pretty large bang<br> there associated with a master alarm.<br> Shit, it's main bus A.<br> - Main bus A undervolt?<br> - Main bus A undervolt down to...<br> It's reading 25 and a half.<br> Main bus B is reading zip now.<br> We got a wicked shimmy up here.<br> These guys are talking<br> about bangs and shimmies.<br> Doesn't sound like instrumentation.<br> - You are breaking up, 13.<br> - Can't get this hatch to seal.<br> Just stow it. If we'd been hit<br> by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.<br> I'm gonna try to get us<br> out of this lurch.<br> Houston, did you say<br> switch to omni Bravo?<br> - Roger that, Thirteen.<br> - The signal strength went way down.<br> It's fighting me. What's the story?<br> We keep flirting with gimbal lock.<br> We need a confirmation.<br> What systems do you have down?<br> - I'm having a hard time, Rick.<br> - S.M.R.C.S. Helium one.<br> - Did you say switch to omni Charlie?<br> - A and C are barber pole.<br> Houston, I'm switching over<br> quad C to main A.<br> Roger that, Thirteen.<br> Okay, Houston, fuel cell one,<br> fuel cell three.<br> We got a main bus B undervolt,<br> cryo pressure, suit compressor.<br> What don't we have?<br> A.C. Bus one, A.C. Bus two...<br> command module computer<br> and O2 flow high.<br> I don't know. Maybe this is<br> a caution and warning failure.<br> Houston, we are venting<br> something out into space.<br> I can see it outside<br> of window one right now.<br> It's definitely, uh...<br> a gas of some sort.<br> It's got to be the oxygen.<br> Roger, Odyssey.<br> We copy your venting.<br> - Give me an alignment.<br> - Let's think about the kind<br> of things we can connect.<br> - Let's start back at the beginning.<br> - Anything look abnormal?<br> Okay, listen up. Quiet down, people.<br> Quiet down. Quiet down.<br> Let's stay cool, people.<br> Procedures, I need another<br> computer up in the R.T.C.C.<br> I want everybody to alert<br> your support teams.<br> Wake up anybody you need<br> and get them in here.<br> Let's work the problem, people.<br> Let's not make things worse<br> by guessin'.<br> the room. We're gonna get you answers.<br> We keep venting, we're gonna keep<br> hitting the edge of that deadband.<br> Take a look at the O2<br> on number one.<br> O2 tank two still zero.<br> - Tank one: 218 psi and falling.<br> - Is that what you're gettin'? Confirm.<br> - We're seeing the same, 13.<br> - Can we review our status, Sy?<br> Let's look at this thing<br> from a standpoint of status.<br> What have we got<br> on the spacecraft that's good?<br> I'll get back to you, Gene.<br> We're not gonna have<br> power much longer.<br> The ship's bleedin' to death.<br> - Flight?<br> - Yeah. Go, EECOM.<br> Um, Flight, I recommend we shut down<br> the reactant valves of the fuel cells.<br> What the hell good<br> is that gonna do?<br> If that's where the leak is,<br> we can isolate it.<br> We can isolate it there,<br> save what's left in the tanks,<br> and we can run on the good cell.<br> You close 'em,<br> you can't open 'em again.<br> You can't land on the moon<br> with one healthy fuel cell.<br> Gene, the Odyssey is dying.<br> From my chair here,<br> this is the last option.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.<br> CAPCOM, let's have them<br> close the reactant valves.<br> Thirteen, this is Houston.<br> We want you to close react valves<br> on cells one and three. Do you copy?<br> Are you saying you want<br> the whole smash?<br> Closing down the react valves<br> for fuel cells shut down?<br> Shutting down the fuel cells?<br> Did I hear you right?<br> Yeah, they heard me right.<br> Tell them we think that's<br> the only way they can stop the leak.<br> Yeah, Jim. We think that closing<br> the react valves may stop the leak.<br> - Did he copy that?<br> - Do you copy, Jim?<br> Yes, Houston, we copy.<br> We just lost the moon.<br> Okay, Freddo,<br> shut those down.<br> Let's see what this does.<br> If this doesn't work...<br> we're not gonna have enough<br> power left to get home.<br> - Shit!<br> - Goddamn it!<br> Houston, O2 on one is still falling.<br> Freddo, how long does it take<br> to power up the LEM?<br> Three hours by the checklist.<br> We don't have that much time.<br> Shit!<br> Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries<br> completely die on us in here...<br> let's power down everything so we can<br> save as much as we can for reentry.<br> Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that's it.<br> The command module will be dead.<br> Okay. Okay, guys, listen up.<br> Here's the drill.<br> We're moving the astronauts<br> over to the LEM.<br> We've got to get some oxygen up there.<br> TELMU, Control, I want emergency power<br> procedure; essential hardware only.<br> GNC, EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down<br> the command module at the same time.<br> We'll have to transfer the guidance<br> system from one computer to the other...<br> so I want those numbers up and ready<br> when our guys are in position.<br> We've gotta transfer all control<br> data over the LEM computer...<br> before the command module dies.<br> The lunar module<br> just became a lifeboat.<br> Odyssey, this is Houston.<br> We need you to power down immediately.<br> You're gonna have to power up<br> the LEM at the same time, so you<br> better get somebody over there.<br> We already have Freddo<br> in the LEM, Houston.<br> We've got serious time pressure.<br> You've got to get<br> the guidance program transferred,<br> and you've got to do it before you're<br> out of power in the command module...<br> or you're not gonna be able<br> to navigate up there.<br> How much time?<br> Can you give me a number?<br> Well, we're looking at less than 15<br> minutes of life support in the Odyssey.<br> We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.<br> It's worse than I thought.<br> Houston, be aware I've moved<br> from the command module into the LEM.<br> If Jack can't get that guidance computer<br> data transferred before they go dead...<br> - They won't even know<br> which way they're pointed.<br> - That's right.<br> - That's a bad way to fly.<br> - I'll be in 210 if you need me.<br> Houston, this is Thirteen.<br> Are you back with me now?<br> Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have<br> about 12 minutes to power up.<br> I can't see any stars. Man, there's a<br> lot of debris floatin' around out there.<br> Okay, Houston, I have completed<br> the steps on page 15.<br> Now I'm ready<br> to power down the computer.<br> I'm gonna need<br> your gimbal angles, Jack...<br> - before you shut down the computer!<br> - Okay, Jim.<br> I need this back to me<br> before they power down.<br> All right, all right.<br> I got it. Hold on.<br> - Houston, our computer is up.<br> - Roger. Stand by.<br> Jack, we need to proceed with<br> steps 12 through 17 quickly.<br> You're down to about<br> eight minutes remaining.<br> Fuel cell pump's off.<br> O2 fans, tank two off.<br> Okay, Houston, check me. I have<br> completed these gimbal conversions...<br> but I need a double check<br> of the arithmetic.<br> - Yeah, you can go, Jim.<br> - The roll CAL angle is minus two.<br> Lunar module roll is 355.57.<br> Pitch: 1678... Correction.<br> Pitch: 167.78.<br> - Yaw is 351.87.<br> - Stand by. We're checking it.<br> We've got negative visibility<br> in our star field,<br> and if this paperwork isn't right,<br> who knows where we'll end up out here?<br> Looks good, Flight.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Good here.<br> - He's good, Andy.<br> - We'll go on those numbers.<br> - You're good.<br> - Log them in, Freddo.<br> Jack, turn off the I.M.U.<br> Switch to S.C.S.<br> Stand by to turn off<br> the thrusters. Over.<br> It's a great day in New York.<br> It's girl watchers' weather.<br> I like those ingenious girl watchers<br> who put on Con Edison helmets...<br> and dig trenches in the street<br> to get a better view.<br> But I... Hey, speaking<br> of girl watching,<br> did you know that our first bachelor<br> astronaut is on his way to the moon?<br> Is it Swigert?<br> Yeah, first bachelor.<br> He's the kind, they say, has a girl<br> in every port. He has that reputation.<br> He's sort of foolishly optimistic,<br> taking nylons, Hershey bars to the moon.<br> Did you read<br> that three million...<br> What do you say?<br> Less viewers or fewer viewers?<br> Three million fewer viewers, uh, watched<br> the space shot than did the last one.<br> Uh, I...<br> Colonel Borman is h...<br> An ABC New...<br> Here is ABC science editor<br> Jules Bergman.<br> The Apollo 13 spacecraft<br> has lost all electrical power,<br> and astronauts Jim Lovell,<br> Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...<br> are making their way through<br> the tunnel to the lunar module,<br> using it as a lifeboat,<br> so they'll have electrical power<br> for their radios on the command module.<br> Apollo 13 is apparently<br> also losing breathing oxygen...<br> Slow down. An electrical failure.<br> What exactly does that mean?<br> The emergency has ruled out<br> any chance of a lunar landing...<br> and could endanger the lives<br> of the astronauts themselves...<br> if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever<br> is left of the command module's oxygen,<br> can't last them until<br> they can get back to Earth.<br> What do you mean there's<br> no immediate danger?<br> I just heard they're losing oxygen.<br> Can they get back?<br> The LEM's descent rocket engine<br> will be used in aborting the mission...<br> and getting the astronauts<br> safely back to Earth.<br> Recapping what has happened: The Apollo<br> No, don't give me<br> that NASA bullshit!<br> I want to know what's<br> happening with my husband!<br> We want to switch control<br> to the Aquarius now.<br> - Roger that.<br> - Houston, wait!<br> You're down to<br> about five minutes now, Jack.<br> Be aware our R.C.S. Isn't up here yet.<br> We have no attitude control on Aquarius.<br> They don't have control?<br> Did we miss a step here?<br> - Control, what the hell happened?<br> - What? I don't know.<br> We're out of whack. I'm trying to pitch<br> down, but we're yawing to the left.<br> Why can't I null this out?<br> She wasn't designed to fly<br> attached like this.<br> It's like flying with<br> a dead elephant on our back.<br> Flight, Guidance. We're getting<br> awfully close to center here.<br> Watch that middle gimbal. We don't<br> want you tumbling off into space.<br> Freddo, inform Houston I'm well aware<br> of the goddamn gimbals!<br> Roger that, Houston.<br> I don't need to hear the obvious.<br> - I've got the frappin' eight-ball<br> in front of me!<br> - Andy, we're on VOX.<br> Aquarius, this is Houston.<br> We've got you both on VOX.<br> You want what?<br> You want us to go to VOX?<br> You have a hot mike.<br> We are reading everything you say.<br> Sorry, Jim.<br> It's only<br> by a very narrow margin...<br> that we're going to get Lovell,<br> Haise and Swigert back alive.<br> Marilyn?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Jeffrey's calling for you.<br> ...the terseness of Kraft and<br> the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.<br> This has been a very close call.<br> We're not out of the woods yet.<br> Jeffrey?<br> Why are so many people here?<br> Oh, well, you know...<br> your dad's flying his mission.<br> He said he was going<br> to get me a moon rock.<br> Right.<br> Well...<br> something broke<br> on your daddy's spaceship,<br> and he's gonna have to turn around<br> before he even gets to the moon.<br> Was it the door?<br> Thirteen, Houston. We still show<br> that venting pushing you around.<br> - How you doing?<br> - Houston, Aquarius.<br> We've had to learn how to fly all over<br> again, but we are doing better now.<br> - Uh, roger that, Aquarius.<br> - Have him close it out.<br> Jack, we can close out<br> your procedure now.<br> Do we know for sure that we can<br> power this thing back up?<br> It's gonna get<br> awfully cold in here.<br> Copy that, Jack.<br> We'll just have to deal with that later.<br> - Computer off.<br> - We're clear.<br> We're going to the LEM.<br> We confirm shutdown, Jack.<br> Lunar module now in control.<br> Roger that, Houston.<br> This is Odyssey signing off.<br> Freddo, we're gonna have<br> to execute some sort of burn.<br> It's just a matter of when.<br> - Did they shut us all down in there?<br> - Yeah.<br> Didn't think we'd<br> be back in here so soon.<br> Houston, how far off course<br> do you project we are?<br> Over.<br> Okay, people, listen up!<br> Gentlemen, I want you all<br> to forget the flight plan.<br> From this moment on, we are<br> improvising a new mission.<br> Sorry about that.<br> - We'll get somebody to look at that.<br> - Find a bulb around here.<br> How do we get our people home?<br> They are here.<br> - Do we turn 'em around,<br> straight back, direct abort?<br> - Yes!<br> - Gene...<br> - I can't guarantee the burn yet.<br> No, sir, no, sir, no, sir!<br> We get them on<br> a free-return trajectory.<br> It's the option with the fewest<br> question marks for safety.<br> I agree with Jerry. We use the moon's<br> gravity to slingshot them around.<br> - The LEM will not support three<br> guys for that amount of time.<br> - It barely holds two.<br> We've got to do a direct abort. We do an<br> about-face, bring the guys right home.<br> Get 'em back soon.<br> Absolutely.<br> We don't even know if<br> the Odyssey's engine's working.<br> If there's been serious damage<br> to this spacecraft...<br> They blow up and they die!<br> - That is not the argument!<br> We are talking about time!<br> - Jesus! Come on!<br> I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!<br> Okay, hold it.<br> Let's hold it down.<br> Let's hold it down. The only engine<br> with enough power for a direct abort...<br> is the S.P.S.<br> On the service module.<br> From what Lovell has told us, it could<br> have been damaged in an explosion,<br> so let's consider<br> that engine dead.<br> We light that thing up,<br> could blow the whole works.<br> It's just too risky.<br> We're not gonna take that chance.<br> About the only thing the command<br> module is good for is reentry.<br> That leaves us with the LEM,<br> which means free-return trajectory.<br> Once we get<br> the guys around the moon,<br> we'll fire up the LEM engine,<br> make a long burn,<br> pick up some speed<br> and get 'em home as quick as we can.<br> Gene, I'm wondering what<br> the Grumman guys think about this.<br> We can't make any guarantees.<br> We designed the LEM to land on the moon,<br> not fire the engine out there<br> for course corrections.<br> Well, unfortunately, we're not<br> landing on the moon, are we?<br> I don't care what anything was designed<br> to do. I care about what it can do.<br> Let's get to work.<br> Let's lay it out, okay?<br> CAPCOM. Flight, he says<br> it will be ready in time.<br> After this burn, we've got to build<br> some time in the flight plan for sleep.<br> - Run it by the F.A.O.<br> - I've run it by the F.A.O.<br> Do we know how long<br> we're gonna fire that burn?<br> - He specifically wanted<br> a quote from a flight director.<br> - Who wanted a quote?<br> - The President.<br> - The President?<br> Nixon. He wants odds.<br> We are not losing the crew.<br> I gotta give him odds.<br> Five to one against?<br> - Three to one?<br> - I don't think they're that good.<br> We are not<br> losing those men!<br> How long are they<br> gonna have to burn the engine?<br> Look, tell him...<br> three to one.<br> Expect loss of signal<br> in less than one minute.<br> When we pick you back up we will<br> have your P.C. Plus two burn data.<br> Roger that, Houston. We'll hear<br> from you again at acquisition of signal.<br> You wanna look?<br> Oh, look at that.<br> Wow.<br> Aquarius, that's 30 seconds<br> until loss of signal.<br> Mare Tranquillitatis.<br> Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.<br> Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.<br> Jim, you gotta<br> take a look at this.<br> I've seen it.<br> Aquarius, this is Houston.<br> We expect loss of signal<br> in approximately ten seconds.<br> So long, Earth.<br> Catch you on the flip side.<br> When you go<br> into the shadow of the moon...<br> and the moon is<br> between you and the sun,<br> you see stars that are more brilliant<br> than anything you've ever seen...<br> on the clearest nights<br> here on Earth.<br> And then you pass into the lunar sunrise<br> over the lunar surface.<br> It must be an awe-inspiring sight.<br> I-I-I can't wait to see it myself.<br> The problem now is not so much<br> a question of an adequate oxygen supply,<br> but it is the rate<br> of consumption of water,<br> which is vitally needed<br> for the cooling operations...<br> to maintain the electronic systems<br> and so forth.<br> Look, it's Fra Mauro.<br> I can see our landing site.<br> Wow.<br> Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.<br> I can't believe how bright<br> the ejecta blanket is.<br> It's like snow. It's beautiful.<br> That's Mare Imbrium to the north.<br> Thirteen, this is Houston.<br> We're reading your telemetry.<br> It's good to see you again.<br> Good to see you too, Houston.<br> We are picking you up at a velocity<br> of 7,062 feet per second...<br> at a distance from the moon<br> of 56 nautical miles.<br> Stand by for your<br> P.C. Plus two burn data.<br> I had an itch to take this baby down,<br> do some prospectin'.<br> Damn, we were close.<br> Gentlemen,<br> what are your intentions?<br> I'd like to go home.<br> We got a burn coming up.<br> We're gonna need a contingency<br> if we lose comm with Houston.<br> Freddo, let's get an idea where<br> we stand on the consumables.<br> Jack, get into the Odyssey...<br> and bag up all the water you can<br> before it freezes in there.<br> Let's go home.<br> Aquarius, we got some P.C.<br> Plus two burn data for you fellas.<br> So you're telling me you can<br> only give our guys 45 hours?<br> That brings them to about there.<br> Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.<br> Gene, Gene, we've got<br> to talk about power.<br> Whoa, whoa, guys!<br> Power is everything!<br> - Power is everything.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Without it, they don't talk to us,<br> they don't correct their trajectory,<br> they don't turn<br> the heat shield around.<br> We gotta turn everything off, now.<br> They're not gonna make it to reentry.<br> - What do you mean, "everything"?<br> - With everything on,<br> the LEM draws 60 amps.<br> At that rate, in 16 hours<br> the batteries are dead, not 45.<br> And so is the crew.<br> We gotta get them down to 12 amps.<br> - Twelve amps?<br> - How many?<br> You can't run a vacuum cleaner<br> on 12 amps, John.<br> We gotta turn off... We have to<br> turn off the radars, cabin heater,<br> instrument displays,<br> the guidance computer, the whole smash.<br> Whoa! Guidance computer.<br> What if they need to do another burn?<br> They won't even know<br> which way they're pointed.<br> The more time we talk,<br> the more juice they waste.<br> - That's the deal?<br> - That's the deal.<br> Okay, John. The minute we finish<br> the burn, we'll power down the LEM.<br> All right.<br> Now in the meantime, we're gonna have<br> a frozen command module up there.<br> We're gonna have to power it up using<br> nothing but the reentry batteries.<br> - That's never been tried.<br> - We've never even simulated it before.<br> Well, we're gonna<br> have to figure it out.<br> I want people in our simulators<br> working reentry scenarios.<br> I want you to find every engineer who<br> designed every switch, every circuit,<br> and every light bulb<br> that's up there.<br> Then talk to the guy in the assembly<br> line who actually built the thing.<br> Find out how to squeeze every amp<br> out of both of these goddamn machines.<br> I want this mark all the way<br> back to Earth with time to spare.<br> We never lost<br> an American in space.<br> We're sure as hell not<br> gonna lose one on my watch.<br> Failure is not an option.<br> Ken?<br> Ken?<br> - What? Huh?<br> - Good, you're not dead.<br> I've been trying to get in touch<br> with you for 45 minutes.<br> Jesus, John,<br> what are you doing here?<br> I gotta get you in the simulators.<br> We got a ship to land.<br> - What?<br> - There's been an explosion.<br> Oxygen tanks are gone. Two fuel cells<br> gone. Command module shut down.<br> - What about the crew?<br> - Crew's fine so far.<br> Trying to keep them<br> alive in the LEM.<br> We're gonna have to shut<br> that down pretty soon too.<br> We got a lot of people working<br> the numbers on this one, Ken.<br> Nobody's too sure how much power<br> we're gonna have when we hit reentry.<br> The command module's gonna be<br> frozen up pretty good by then.<br> You see this ammeter rise over 20<br> at any point, power-up is no good.<br> We see it spike, that's sayonara<br> for the guidance computer.<br> Our guys can't reenter. Okay?<br> How much power do we have<br> to play with?<br> Barely enough to run this<br> coffee pot for nine hours.<br> - Go.<br> - Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.<br> Copy. He's here.<br> They've been losing heat<br> since the accident.<br> They're gonna start getting water<br> condensation on the control panels.<br> - Ken, glad you're here.<br> You know what's going on?<br> - John's brought me up to speed.<br> - What do we have left in the batteries?<br> - We don't really know.<br> We gotta get started on<br> some shortcuts for power-up.<br> You know how short?<br> It's all in the sequencing. If we can<br> skip whatever we don't absolutely need,<br> - turn things on in the right order...<br> - I agree.<br> - You started on a procedure?<br> - The engineers have tried,<br> but it's your ship.<br> - We gotta get you in there.<br> - Okay.<br> Frank, I need the sim<br> cold and dark.<br> Give me the exact same conditions<br> they've got in there now.<br> - I need present status<br> of every instrument.<br> - You got it.<br> I need a flashlight.<br> That's not what they have up there.<br> Don't give me anything<br> they don't have on board.<br> Let's get this show on the road.<br> Put him in space, fellas.<br> Okay, Houston, the quad heater<br> circuit breakers are open.<br> Copy that.<br> We're using the forward omni<br> when the earth's in the window,<br> and we're switching to aft omni<br> when we see the moon.<br> We copy that, Thirteen.<br> Aquarius, we don't want you<br> to make any more waste dumps.<br> The venting may<br> push you off course.<br> - Oh, Christ.<br> - What's up?<br> No more waste dumps.<br> We're just gonna have to store it.<br> Jack, we're gonna need<br> some more urine bags.<br> Okay, Houston, that leaves us<br> with just the computer,<br> which I'm shutting down now.<br> And that's it.<br> We just put Sir Isaac Newton<br> in the driver's seat.<br> Is it A.M. Or P.M.?<br> A.M. Very, very A.M.<br> Haise is running a temperature,<br> and none of them has slept.<br> I can't order these guys to go to sleep.<br> Could you sleep up there?<br> It's gonna get awful cold<br> in there for those guys.<br> Gene, we have a situation<br> brewing with the carbon dioxide.<br> We got a CO2 filter problem<br> on the lunar module.<br> - Five filters on the LEM.<br> - Meant for 2 guys for a day and a half.<br> - I told the doc...<br> - They're already up to 8 on the gauges.<br> Anything over 15 and you get<br> impaired judgment, blackouts,<br> - beginnings of brain asphyxia.<br> - What about the scrubbers<br> on the command module?<br> - They take square cartridges.<br> - The ones on the LEM are round.<br> Tell me this isn't<br> a government operation.<br> This just isn't a contingency<br> we've remotely looked at.<br> Those CO2 levels<br> are gonna be getting toxic.<br> I suggest you invent a way to put<br> a square peg in a round hole rapidly.<br> Okay, people, listen up.<br> The people upstairs have handed us<br> this one, and we gotta come through.<br> We gotta find a way<br> to make this...<br> fit into the hole for this...<br> using nothing but that.<br> - Let's get it organized.<br> - Okay, let's build a filter.<br> Better get some coffee<br> going too, someone.<br> The Haise family<br> lives in El Lago, Texas.<br> His wife, Mary,<br> is from Biloxi, Mississippi.<br> When Fred Haise<br> was growing up in Biloxi,<br> he may have looked<br> ahead to a fine family,<br> but he never dreamt of flying.<br> I'd never flown really<br> before I went into the service,<br> and I only went into the flying business<br> as a means to getting a commission.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Henry. Don't you ever sleep?<br> - I have a request from the news people.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> They want to put<br> a transmitter up on the lawn.<br> Transmitter?<br> It's kind of a tower<br> for a live broadcast.<br> They didn't care about this mission.<br> They didn't even run Jim's show.<br> Well... it's more dramatic now.<br> Suddenly people are...<br> Landing on the moon<br> wasn't dramatic enough for them.<br> Why should not landing be?<br> Look, I, um, realize<br> how hard this is, Marilyn,<br> but the whole world<br> is caught up in it.<br> - It's the biggest story since...<br> - No, Henry.<br> Those people don't put one piece<br> of equipment on my lawn.<br> If they have a problem with that,<br> they can take it up with my husband.<br> He'll be home on Friday.<br> When you are sad and Ionely<br> And have no place to go<br> Come to see me, baby<br> and bring along some dough<br> And we'll go honky tonkin'<br> Honky tonkin'<br> Honky tonkin', honey baby<br> We'll go honky tonkin'<br> 'round this town<br> Hey, Freddo.<br> It's too cold in there.<br> Yeah.<br> That's a nice one of Mary.<br> - You don't look too good, Freddo.<br> - I'll survive.<br> - There's aspirin in the medical kit.<br> - I took some.<br> Jim, I'm all right.<br> It was an accident,<br> Mary gettin' pregnant.<br> You should have seen the look<br> on my face when she told me.<br> Well, that has<br> a tendency to happen.<br> Yeah.<br> I wonder if it's<br> a boy or a girl.<br> You're gonna find out<br> soon enough.<br> Sure.<br> I never dreamed I'd ever get<br> to do something like this:<br> Come up here on a real mission.<br> Most of the guys<br> I graduated high school with...<br> never even left home,<br> and here I am.<br> Oh, yeah... here you are.<br> It hurts when I urinate.<br> Well, you're not<br> gettin' enough water.<br> I'm drinking my ration<br> the same as you.<br> I think old Swigert<br> gave me the clap.<br> He's been pissin' in my relief tube.<br> Well... that will be a hot one at<br> the debriefing for the flight surgeon.<br> That's another first<br> for America's space program.<br> Listen, um... I've been<br> going... over some stuff,<br> and I'm a little worried about this cold<br> affecting our battery efficiency.<br> We quit heatin' the glycol to save<br> water and power, so that's not helping.<br> It could cost us<br> amp hours on the back end?<br> - That's a possibility.<br> - I've been goin' over the numbers again.<br> Have they called up<br> with a reentry plan yet?<br> - We're comin' in too shallow and fast.<br> - We're workin' on something. Hold on.<br> I can't remember<br> the ratio to temperature.<br> We got no references on board.<br> Let's see if Houston<br> can pull up the mill specs.<br> Listen, listen! They gave us too much<br> Delta V. They had us burn too long.<br> At this rate we're gonna skip<br> right out of the atmosphere,<br> and we're never gonna get back.<br> What are you talkin' about?<br> How'd you figure that?<br> I can add.<br> - They've got half the Ph.D. S<br> on the planet working on this.<br> - Houston says we're on the money.<br> What if they made a mistake and<br> there was no way to reverse it?<br> Do you think they would tell us?<br> - There's no reason to tell us.<br> - What do you mean? That's bullshit!<br> There's a thousand things<br> that have to happen in order.<br> We are on number eight.<br> You're talking about number 692.<br> In the meantime, I'm trying to<br> tell you we're coming in too fast.<br> I think they know it, and that's why<br> we don't have a goddamn reentry plan.<br> That's duly noted.<br> Thank you, Jack.<br> Ow!<br> - Goddamn this piece of shit!<br> - Hey!<br> - This piece of shit's<br> gonna get you home.<br> - All right.<br> That's because that's<br> the only thing we got left, Jack!<br> - What are you saying, Fred?<br> - I think you know what I'm saying.<br> Now wait a minute.<br> All I did was stir those tanks.<br> What was that gauge reading<br> before you hit the switch?<br> - Don't tell me how to fly the damn C.M.!<br> - You don't know, do you?<br> They brought me in to do a job!<br> They asked me to stir the tanks,<br> and I stirred the tanks!<br> - Stop kicking yourself in the ass.<br> - This is not my fault!<br> No one is saying it is.<br> If I'm in the left-hand seat when<br> the call comes up, I stir the tanks.<br> Yeah, well, tell him that.<br> I just asked you what the gauge<br> was readin', and you don't know!<br> Look, we're not doing this.<br> We are not gonna do this.<br> We're not gonna go bouncing<br> off the walls for ten minutes...<br> because we're just gonna end up right<br> back here with the same problems!<br> Try to figure out<br> how to stay alive!<br> Aquarius, this is Houston.<br> - Are we on VOX?<br> - No, we're not on VOX.<br> Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius.<br> Go ahead.<br> Yeah, Jim, could you check<br> your CO2 gauge for us?<br> Yeah, Houston,<br> we were just looking at that.<br> Our CO2 measurement has jumped<br> four notches in the last hour.<br> That can't be right.<br> I went over those numbers three times.<br> Jim, that sounds about right.<br> We were expecting that.<br> That's very comforting, Houston.<br> What do we do about it?<br> We're working on a procedure<br> down here for you.<br> - Do you copy?<br> - Oh, Christ.<br> All right, Houston, we're<br> standing by for those procedures.<br> Christ, I know why<br> my numbers are wrong.<br> I only figured it<br> for two people.<br> Maybe I should just<br> hold my breath.<br> The deadly CO2 gas is poisoning the<br> astronauts with every breath in and out.<br> Heads up. Heads up.<br> - Oh! Go, go, go, go!<br> - Someone get that. Damn.<br> Heads up, people.<br> Look out now.<br> - What's this?<br> - That's what they gotta make.<br> - I hope you got the procedures for me.<br> - Right here.<br> That's it?<br> All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.<br> Do you have a flight plan?<br> Affirmative, Andy.<br> Jack's got one right here.<br> Okay, we have an unusual<br> procedure for you here.<br> We need you<br> to rip the cover off.<br> He wants you to rip the cover<br> off the flight plan.<br> With pleasure.<br> The other materials<br> you're gonna need here are...<br> - a lithium hydroxide canister...<br> - Two, two.<br> Two lithium hydroxide canisters.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - A roll of gray tape.<br> - Duct tape.<br> Duct tape. You need an L.C.G. Bag...<br> Two L.C.G. Bags.<br> The red suit hoses,<br> and you've got the flight plan cover.<br> - Can you give me a timetable?<br> - Henry! Henry!<br> What about their level<br> of carbon dioxide?<br> It's, uh, climbing.<br> You're saying that they're<br> almost out of breathable air?<br> Wait a second. That's not what he said.<br> He said we're working on it.<br> You want to cut<br> the duct tape three feet long.<br> - Tell him to use his arm.<br> - Just use your arm.<br> - It's a good arm length.<br> - I see what you're getting at. Hold on.<br> Jack, tear that piece of tape<br> down the middle lengthwise.<br> - All right?<br> - Hold on, Houston.<br> While the astronauts appear to have<br> enough oxygen to keep them alive,<br> one thing they have too much of<br> is carbon dioxide.<br> With each breath,<br> the three men expel...<br> more of the poisonous gas<br> into the lunar module cockpit,<br> and the scrubbers intended to<br> keep the atmosphere breathable...<br> are quickly becoming saturated.<br> Oh, shit. I tore it.<br> Shit!<br> Houston, what do we do if we<br> ripped the bag? Can we tape it?<br> - They just tore the bag.<br> - Oh, no.<br> Uh, stand by.<br> What should I tell 'em to do?<br> They should have one more.<br> But they've still got<br> a long way to come.<br> They are now working on their backup<br> facilities, their emergency facilities.<br> The problem is, if anything more<br> goes wrong, they're in real trouble.<br> As most of you are aware, there is<br> no rescue possible in space flight.<br> A-Any rescue system the space agency<br> has long since calculated...<br> Hold this a minute.<br> Since any rescue system<br> the space agency calculated...<br> - One sock.<br> - Once you have the sock in place,<br> - we're gonna want you to bungee...<br> - Work it in.<br> The entire filter assembly<br> to the bulkhead,<br> - right above the LEM canister.<br> - We're getting close to 15.<br> So how does this flight compare to other<br> emergency situations you've faced?<br> I'd have to say that this is<br> the most serious situation...<br> we've ever encountered<br> in manned space flight.<br> - Houston, filter's in place.<br> - Cabin gas return to egress.<br> Suit circuit relief to close.<br> - CO2 canister select to secondary.<br> - All right.<br> Here goes.<br> I can hear air moving.<br> Just breathe normal, fellas.<br> Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.<br> Yeah, Houston, we're taking<br> a look at those numbers now.<br> We're still holding<br> close to 15, Houston.<br> Roger that. Standing by.<br> Houston, the CO2 level<br> has dropped to nine...<br> and it is still falling.<br> - Yes!<br> - Great. Good job, you guys.<br> That is good to hear, Aquarius.<br> And you, sir,<br> are a steely-eyed missile man.<br> Okay, spacecraft control to computer.<br> Damn!<br> Damn.<br> We overloaded.<br> We used way too much power.<br> There must be a sneak circuit<br> between step seven and ten.<br> - Which one has the leak?<br> - Don't know that yet, John.<br> The sequence was wrong. We just have to<br> go back and try 'em one at a time.<br> You need a break, Ken?<br> If they don't get one,<br> I don't get one.<br> Well, if it won't work,<br> get me another one.<br> - My son's supposed to be on.<br> - I know, Mrs. Lovell.<br> - Hi, Blanch.<br> - They can't fix a thing in this place.<br> Blanch, it's Marilyn.<br> Hi, Grandma.<br> - I was gonna see Jimmy.<br> - I know. I know.<br> We came to tell you something.<br> There's been an accident.<br> Jimmy's okay. He's all right.<br> But he's not gonna get<br> to walk on the moon.<br> Well, they said he was.<br> I know. I know.<br> Um... that was before.<br> Now there's been an explosion,<br> and they're all okay.<br> They're all right.<br> But now they're just going to...<br> try to figure out<br> a way to get them home.<br> And...<br> And it's a little bit dangerous.<br> Oh, sweetie.<br> Are you scared?<br> Well, don't you worry, honey.<br> If they could get<br> a washing machine to fly,<br> my Jimmy could land it.<br> You saw me standing alone<br> Without a dream in my heart<br> Without a love of my own<br> Jack, you'll be happy to hear<br> we contacted President Nixon,<br> and he's gonna grant you<br> an extension on your income taxes...<br> since you are most decidedly<br> out of the country.<br> Roger that, Houston.<br> That's wonderful news.<br> Tell them they have to sleep.<br> Haise is running a fever of 104.<br> Thirteen, we've had another<br> request from the flight surgeon...<br> that you fellas get more sleep.<br> He doesn't like<br> his readings down here.<br> Let's see how<br> he feels about this.<br> I am sick and tired<br> of the entire western world...<br> knowing how my kidneys<br> are functioning!<br> Flight, I just lost Lovell!<br> Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.<br> Jim, we just had a dropout<br> on your bio-med sensors.<br> I'm not wearing<br> my bio-med sensors, Houston.<br> Okay, Jim. Copy that.<br> Now I'm losing all three of 'em!<br> It's just a little<br> medical mutiny, Doc.<br> I'm sure the guys<br> are still with us.<br> Let's cut 'em<br> some slack, okay?<br> It's not the velocity,<br> it's the angle.<br> Maybe they're still venting something<br> that's throwing off the trajectory,<br> but we are definitely<br> shallowing again.<br> - We are up to a 5.9.<br> - Damn it.<br> At this rate, they nick the earth's<br> atmosphere and bounce off into space.<br> - We need another burn<br> to get them back in the corridor.<br> - Definitely another burn.<br> - Another burn. Copy that.<br> - Fire the engines and get 'em on course.<br> Aquarius, this is Houston.<br> Houston, Aquarius.<br> Jim, we've got another<br> course correction for you.<br> What's up?<br> Something about another<br> course correction.<br> Uh, we copy, Houston.<br> Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and I<br> a while to power up the computer...<br> for the alignment platform<br> if we have to fire the engine.<br> Negative on that, Jim.<br> We can't spare power<br> for the computer.<br> We gotta do this blind?<br> Without the computer,<br> what do we use for orientation?<br> We've got to be able<br> to give these guys something.<br> Without the power,<br> we can't give them a reading.<br> I'm not talking about power,<br> I'm talking about reference.<br> No, there's no references.<br> We have debris up there.<br> Houston, what's the story<br> with this burn?<br> We're trying to hash something out<br> down here, Aquarius.<br> Stand by.<br> Look, Houston. All we need to hold<br> attitude is one fixed point in space.<br> - Is that not correct?<br> - Yeah. Roger that, Jim.<br> Well, Houston, we've got one.<br> If we can keep the Earth<br> in the window, flying manually,<br> the co-ax cross hairs<br> right on its terminator,<br> all I have to know is: How long<br> do we need to burn the engine?<br> - The shorter, the better.<br> - Roger that, Jim.<br> Can they fly it manually<br> and still shut it down...<br> on time without the computer?<br> I guess that's the best we can do.<br> We're out of time.<br> In order to enter<br> the atmosphere safely,<br> the crew must aim for a corridor<br> just two and a half degrees wide.<br> If they're too steep, they'll incinerate<br> in the steadily thickening air.<br> If they're too shallow,<br> they'll ricochet...<br> off the atmosphere like<br> a rock skipping off a pond.<br> The reentry corridor is,<br> in fact, so narrow...<br> that if this basketball<br> were the Earth...<br> and this softball<br> were the moon,<br> and the two were placed<br> the crew would have to hit a target<br> no thicker than this piece of paper.<br> Okay, people, on your toes.<br> We're doing this one blind.<br> Gene, I want you to understand<br> we've never tried this before:<br> Burn, cold soak, burn,<br> cold soak, burn, manual control.<br> Look, it will ignite, will it not?<br> I just want you to know the engine's<br> never been tried like this.<br> That's all I'm trying to tell you.<br> I know what you're trying to do.<br> I guarantee you, I won't hold you<br> personally responsible.<br> If it lights, it lights.<br> Let Lovell do the rest.<br> Okay.<br> They're gonna burn the engines<br> and steer it manually,<br> attempting to keep<br> the Earth in the window.<br> Okay, this is gonna take<br> all three of us.<br> Freddo...<br> you handle the pitch.<br> Put on the translation<br> controllers, all backwards.<br> So if the Earth starts drifting down,<br> you need to thrust aft,<br> not forward.<br> I'll do the same on mine<br> with everything else.<br> We're going to burn at ten percent<br> thrust for 39 seconds.<br> - Jack, you time us.<br> - Got it.<br> Give us a count of<br> the last ten seconds up to 39.<br> Let's not miss this.<br> You up to this, Freddo?<br> I'm with you.<br> Standing by<br> for corridor control burn.<br> Okay, Jim,<br> you can fire when ready.<br> You are go<br> for the manual burn.<br> Okay, X plus button<br> at ten seconds. Mark.<br> - Come on, baby. One more burn.<br> - Nine, eight,<br> seven, six, five,<br> - four, three,<br> - Ullage is go.<br> Two, one, ignition!<br> - She's burnin'!<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Master arm off.<br> - Okay, here we go.<br> - Helium regulator on.<br> - R.C.S. Is go, 10% thrust.<br> - Bring her around, Freddo.<br> - I'm tryin', but it's draggin'.<br> - Ten seconds.<br> - Drop it down, Freddo.<br> - We're driftin'!<br> - No, hold what you got.<br> - I'll roll it. Back off.<br> - I can't get it stable.<br> She's dancin' all over the place!<br> - Come to the right a little bit.<br> - Fifteen seconds.<br> She's driftin'.<br> I'm losin' attitude.<br> Hold it right there.<br> That's it. No, Freddo, back!<br> - Shit! I'm losin' it!<br> - Bring the Earth up.<br> Forward, Fred.<br> Come on. Forward.<br> Shit, I lost it!<br> Where is it? Where is it?<br> Bring it down, Freddo.<br> Just nose it down.<br> - Okay, uh, okay, I got it!<br> - Thirty seconds.<br> Little farther.<br> Ease your touch!<br> Damn it! Damn it, that's mine.<br> That's me. Around.<br> - A little more. Come on, baby.<br> - Come on, that's it. Hold it. Damn it!<br> - Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.<br> ...seven, eight, nine!<br> Shutdown!<br> Houston, we have shutdown.<br> That's close enough, Jim. Good work.<br> I knew it! I knew it!<br> How about that LEM, huh?<br> How about it?<br> - Guess you can keep your job.<br> - You betcha.<br> Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating<br> our power usage on that burn.<br> Well, let's hope we don't<br> have to do that again.<br> Gentlemen, you've given our guys<br> enough to survive 'til reentry.<br> Well done.<br> Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me<br> about the power-up procedures.<br> Here's the order<br> of what I want to do.<br> I want to power up Guidance,<br> E.C.S., Communications,<br> warm up the pyros for the parachutes<br> and the command module thrusters.<br> The thrusters are gonna<br> put you over budget on amps.<br> They've been sitting at 200 below for<br> four days, John. They gotta be heated.<br> Fine. Then trade off<br> the parachutes, something.<br> Well, if the chutes<br> don't open, what's the point?<br> You're telling me what you need.<br> I'm telling you what we have<br> to work with at this point.<br> I'm not making this stuff up.<br> They're going to need<br> all these systems, John.<br> We do not have the power, Ken.<br> We just don't have it.<br> Okay, I'm gonna go back<br> and reorganize the sequencing again...<br> and find more power.<br> Let's start from scratch.<br> Clear the board.<br> I don't know where the hell<br> we're gonna find it.<br> Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell<br> has more time in space,<br> almost 24 days already,<br> than any other man,<br> and I asked him recently<br> if he ever was scared.<br> I've had an engine flame out<br> a few times in an aircraft...<br> and was curious as to whether it<br> was going to light up again,<br> but, uh, they seem to work out.<br> Is there an instance<br> in an airplane emergency...<br> when you can recall fear?<br> Uh, well, I remember this one time,<br> I'm in a Banshee at night in<br> combat conditions, so there's no<br> running lights on the carrier.<br> It was the Shangri-la,<br> and we were in the Sea of Japan.<br> My radar had jammed,<br> and my homing signal was gone...<br> because somebody in Japan<br> was actually using the same frequency,<br> and so it was leading me away<br> from where I was supposed to be.<br> I'm looking down at a big, black ocean,<br> so I flip on my map light.<br> Then, suddenly, zap, everything<br> shorts out right there in my cockpit.<br> All my instruments are gone.<br> My lights are gone and I can't<br> even tell what my altitude is.<br> I know I'm running out of fuel, so I'm<br> thinking about ditching into the ocean.<br> I look down there<br> and then, in the darkness,<br> there's this, uh,<br> there's this green trail.<br> It's like a long carpet that's just laid<br> out right beneath me. It was the algae.<br> It was that phosphorescent stuff...<br> that gets churned up<br> in the wake of a big ship.<br> It was, it was, it was<br> just leading me home.<br> If my cockpit lights<br> hadn't shorted out,<br> there's no way I'd have ever<br> been able to see that.<br> So, uh, you, uh,<br> you never know...<br> what, what events are going<br> to transpire to get you home.<br> Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell,<br> no stranger to emergencies.<br> - How's it going, Fred?<br> - I'm okay.<br> What the hell was that?<br> Let's hope it was<br> just the burst disk.<br> - Can you confirm a burst helium disk?<br> - We confirm that.<br> Houston, is that going to<br> affect our, uh, entry angle at all?<br> Uh, negative. Your entry angle<br> is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.<br> Houston, uh...<br> we, we sure could use...<br> the reentry procedure up here.<br> When can we expect that?<br> Uh, that's coming<br> real soon, Aquarius.<br> Uh, Houston, we, we...<br> We just can't throw this<br> together at the last minute.<br> So, here's what you're gonna do.<br> You're gonna get the procedure<br> up to us, whatever it is,<br> and we're gonna go over it<br> step by step, so there's no foul-ups.<br> I don't have to tell you<br> we're all a little tired up here.<br> The world's getting awfully big<br> in the window.<br> - Jim, this is Deke.<br> - It's Deke.<br> They don't know how to do it.<br> - Maybe Jack's right.<br> - Hello there, Deke. What's the story?<br> We're gonna get that<br> power-up procedure to you.<br> We're gonna get it<br> as soon as we possibly can.<br> Ken Mattingly's<br> in the simulator right now.<br> Ken's working on it?<br> Look...<br> I know this sequence works, John.<br> The sequence looks good.<br> We're just over budget on the amperage.<br> - By how much?<br> - Three or four amps.<br> Goddamn it, John!<br> Is it three or four?<br> - Four.<br> - Four!<br> Four more amps.<br> We know they have some power left<br> in the LEM batteries, right?<br> Yeah.<br> We have an umbilical that provides power<br> from the command module to the LEM.<br> - It's backup for the LEM power supply.<br> - I'm listening.<br> So... reverse it.<br> Reverse the flow and see if<br> we can draw these four amps...<br> from the LEM batteries<br> before we cut it lose.<br> - Why can't we do that?<br> - We don't have a procedure for that?<br> You're gonna lose a lot<br> in the transfer, Ken.<br> Yeah, yeah, but all we're<br> talking about here is four amps.<br> I want whatever you guys got<br> on these power procedures.<br> - Gene, they're already...<br> - I don't want the whole bible,<br> just a couple of chapters.<br> - We've got to get something<br> up to these guys.<br> - They're working on it.<br> - I'll call the simulator<br> and get an estimate.<br> - Goddamn it!<br> I don't want another estimate!<br> I want the procedures... now!<br> I.M.U. Is up.<br> - How am I reading?<br> - Fine, so far.<br> - Say again.<br> - You're under the limit. Keep going.<br> Okay. Floodlights to fixed.<br> Okay, I'm bringing up the guidance.<br> Here we go.<br> C.M.C. Attitude I.M.U.<br> C.M.C. Source.<br> C.M.C. Mode, auto,<br> and we're on the computer.<br> Ken?<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Is your computer on now?<br> Up and running.<br> How do we look?<br> John?<br> I think we got it, buddy.<br> Arthur, my notes are clear<br> on that last sequence, right?<br> Yeah.<br> - Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> - I was getting a little blurry there.<br> Here's Ken. Here's John.<br> It's good to see you, Ken.<br> This is the sequence.<br> - Was it tried on the hardware yet?<br> - We didn't have time.<br> Aquarius, Houston.<br> Do you read?<br> Yeah, we read you, Ken.<br> Are the flowers blooming in Houston?<br> Uh, that's a negative, Jim.<br> I don't have the measles.<br> Jim, is Jack in there with you?<br> Uh, yeah, stand by one.<br> We gotta get him on comm.<br> - Put those on the table.<br> - Oh, damn it. Thanks, Jackie.<br> I think it would<br> really help if you could...<br> just distract her when<br> the heavy predictions come in.<br> - Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.<br> - Thanks.<br> Blanch.<br> Blanch, these nice, young men<br> are gonna watch the television with you.<br> This is Neil Armstrong,<br> and this is Buzz Aldrin.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> - Hi.<br> - Are you boys in the space program too?<br> Okay, Jack, give me a read-back<br> on that last procedure.<br> Uh, stand by, Ken.<br> Ken, I'm having trouble<br> reading my own writing.<br> I guess I was a little<br> more tired than I thought.<br> Uh, don't worry, Jack.<br> I'll talk you through it.<br> Okay, find the main<br> bus breakers on panel 11.<br> Yeah, main bus breakers.<br> - Got it.<br> - Close main bus B.<br> Ken, there's an awful lot<br> of condensation on these panels.<br> What's the word on these<br> things shorting out?<br> Uh, we'll just take that<br> one at a time, Jack.<br> It's like tryin' to drive<br> a toaster through a car wash.<br> Main bus B is closed.<br> Okay, Thirteen, we're coming up<br> on entry interface.<br> Flight, we're still shallowing up<br> a bit in the reentry corridor.<br> It's almost like<br> they're underweight.<br> - Now how could they be underweight?<br> - We didn't land on the moon.<br> - Rocks?<br> - That's affirm.<br> Uh, one more thing, Jim.<br> While Jack's working on the power-up,<br> we'd like you and Freddo...<br> to transfer some ballast<br> over to the command module.<br> Uh, say again, Houston.<br> Ballast?<br> Um, that's affirm.<br> We got to get the weight right.<br> We were expecting you to be toting<br> a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.<br> Right, Houston.<br> - Now, Jack.<br> - Yeah, go ahead, Ken.<br> Okay, now, uh, panel five.<br> Circuit breaker caution<br> and warning main B closed.<br> Main B closed.<br> Master alarm off.<br> Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven,<br> B-MAG number two, power to warm-up.<br> B-MAG number two,<br> power to warm-up done.<br> Sequential logic one and two on.<br> Sequential logic... two on.<br> C.M.R.C.S. Pressure on.<br> C.M.R.C.S. Pressurization.<br> As her husband prepares to jettison<br> his lunar module lifeboat,<br> Marilyn Lovell waits with her<br> children, her neighbors...<br> and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts<br> Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.<br> Only the Lovell's eldest son,<br> Jay, is absent...<br> as he holds vigil<br> with his classmates...<br> at the St. Johns Military Academy<br> in Wisconsin.<br> ABC News science editor<br> Jules Bergman.<br> With a crippled command module, and<br> surviving by using the LEM's systems,<br> there can be no easy maneuver.<br> Their LEM lifeboat is doing things<br> and working longer...<br> than it was ever intended to.<br> It's a race against time<br> until splashdown.<br> Okay, Jack, we're ready to see<br> if the computer will accept...<br> - uplink of the reentry data now.<br> - Okay, the I.M.U. Is up.<br> - We got our eight-balls back.<br> - Copy that.<br> Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry,<br> command module to accept, right?<br> That's affirm.<br> Go ahead and try it.<br> Come on.<br> Uplink completed.<br> - Yeah. That's more like it.<br> - We're back in business.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Okay, let's go.<br> Look at your amps. How we doin'?<br> We got her back up, Ken.<br> Boy, I wish<br> you were here to see it.<br> I'll bet you do.<br> Way to go, Jack.<br> - Flight, this is RETRO.<br> - Go, RETRO.<br> Flight, we are looking<br> at a typhoon warning...<br> - on the edge of the prime recovery zone.<br> - Say again, RETRO.<br> We are looking at a typhoon warning<br> on the edge of the prime recovery area.<br> This is just a warning.<br> It could miss them.<br> Only if their luck changes.<br> Jim, we're ready<br> for S.M. Jettison!<br> All right, Jack, on three!<br> One... two...<br> - upward thrust.<br> - We're loose!<br> Reverse thrust!<br> We have service module jettison.<br> Okay, Houston,<br> service module is free.<br> We're gonna take a look<br> at what we have here.<br> Copy that.<br> There it is. I see it!<br> Oh.<br> Houston, we're getting our first look<br> at the service module now.<br> One whole side<br> of the spacecraft is missing.<br> Right by the high gain antennae<br> a whole panel is blown out,<br> right up, right up<br> to our heat shield.<br> Uh, copy that, Aquarius.<br> It looked like it got<br> the engine bell too. Can you see that?<br> Oh, man, that's incredible.<br> The heat shield.<br> The heat will build up to as much<br> as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.<br> On a lunar reentry flight,<br> the heat approaches 4,000 degrees.<br> So, uh, Blanch?<br> Blanch? Did Jim make<br> Eagle Scout or not?<br> - Yes, he did.<br> - He did.<br> If the heat shield<br> is even slightly cracked,<br> the extreme cold<br> could have split it wide open.<br> Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics<br> that control the parachutes...<br> have been damaged,<br> the chutes may not open at all,<br> causing the spacecraft to hit the water<br> not at a gentle 20 miles per hour,<br> but at a suicidal 300.<br> Perhaps never in human history...<br> has the entire world been united<br> by such a global drama.<br> In New York City, thousands<br> of people have gathered...<br> to watch updates of the mission<br> in Times Square.<br> Many countries offered help,<br> and the State Department said...<br> it would ask for it<br> if it were needed.<br> The House and Senate passed resolutions<br> calling on the American people...<br> to pray tonight<br> for the astronauts.<br> In Rome, Pope Paul<br> led 50,000 people...<br> in prayers for the safe<br> return of the astronauts.<br> In Jerusalem,<br> prayers at the Wailing Wall.<br> Uh, it's about time to bail<br> out of this ship, Freddo.<br> Freddo?<br> You okay?<br> I'm, uh... I'm freezing.<br> Can you hold out<br> just a little longer?<br> - Long as I have to.<br> - Aw, come on.<br> It won't be long.<br> Just a little while longer, Freddo.<br> Just a little while longer. We're gonna<br> hit that water in the South Pacific.<br> Open up that hatch.<br> - It's 80 degrees out there.<br> - Eighty degrees.<br> - You are a mess.<br> - Y-Yeah.<br> Odyssey, Houston.<br> Uh, how we doin', guys?<br> We're closing in<br> on lunar module jettison.<br> As you know,<br> that is time critical.<br> We should be making our move<br> into the command module.<br> Let's get that hatch<br> buttoned up,<br> and, when you get a chance,<br> let us know how you're doing.<br> Roger that.<br> Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.<br> We're coming up on LEM jettison.<br> Is everyone strapped in, Ken?<br> We're getting real close.<br> Uh, copy that, Flight. Uh, 13, Houston.<br> Uh, we're coming up on LEM jettison.<br> Stand by.<br> Have you got everybody<br> in the Odyssey?<br> Yeah, Ken, I'm gonna check those<br> pyro batteries one more time here.<br> Okay, the pyro batts look good.<br> I don't think we're gonna<br> have to tie the other batteries.<br> Sorry, Jack,<br> this is an old habit.<br> I'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.<br> She's yours to fly.<br> Okay, Odyssey, I want to double check<br> some reentry procedures...<br> right after we jettison the LEM,<br> which is coming up in 30 seconds.<br> What is that?<br> Oh, I was getting<br> a little punchy,<br> and I didn't want to cut the LEM loose<br> with you guys still in it.<br> That's good thinking.<br> Stand by, Houston.<br> We have lunar module jettison.<br> She sure was a good ship.<br> Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.<br> Mary?<br> It's almost time, honey.<br> Flight 9-6-6-4-0-6.<br> Let me put it this way.<br> The trajectory may be off.<br> Their thrusters may be frozen.<br> Their guidance system<br> might be malfunctioning.<br> Their heat shield could be cracked.<br> And their parachutes<br> might be three blocks of ice.<br> Clearly, we have<br> some obstacles to overcome.<br> Yeah, okay, but now I'm asking you,<br> when will we know?<br> Well, blackout lasts<br> for three minutes.<br> If they're not back<br> in four, we'll know.<br> Velocity now reading<br> - Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.<br> - Copy that.<br> Okay, Ken,<br> we are aligned for reentry.<br> Jim, we're going to need<br> that computer reentry program.<br> - Fred, how are the batteries looking?<br> - Okay. Batt A looks good.<br> Reentry interface in one minute...<br> - Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.<br> - And 30 seconds.<br> Batt C...<br> shit, no volts, only two amps.<br> It may die before<br> the main chutes open.<br> Roger. Let's tie all the batteries<br> onto main A and main B.<br> Flight, they're still shallowing a bit<br> up there. Do you want to tell 'em?<br> - Is there anything we can do about it?<br> - Not now, Flight.<br> - Then they don't need to know, do they?<br> - Copy that.<br> RETRO says the typhoon is still<br> a presence in the splashdown area?<br> - Yeah.<br> - We got the parachute situation,<br> the heat shield, the angle<br> of trajectory and the typhoon.<br> There's so many variables,<br> I'm a little at a loss...<br> I know what the problems are.<br> This could be the worst disaster<br> NASA's ever experienced.<br> With all due respect, sir, I believe<br> this is going to be our finest hour.<br> Okay.<br> Expect entry interface<br> in 45 seconds.<br> And on my mark, your velocity...<br> will be 35,245 feet per second.<br> Mark 35 seconds<br> to entry interface.<br> Gentlemen...<br> it's been a privilege<br> flying with you.<br> Flight, we have loss<br> of radio contact.<br> Roger that.<br> Expect to regain signal<br> in three minutes.<br> It all depends<br> on the heat shield.<br> Back to the Iwo Jima<br> and our live cameras there.<br> The Navy recovery and rescue<br> helicopters already airborne,<br> circling, waiting<br> for first radar contact.<br> Coming up now on three minutes<br> until time of drogue deployment.<br> Bill, what time you got?<br> Standing by for any reports<br> of acquisition.<br> One minute and 30 seconds<br> to end of blackout.<br> No reentering ship<br> has ever taken longer...<br> than three minutes<br> to emerge from blackout.<br> This is the critical moment.<br> Will the heat shield hold?<br> Will the command module survive<br> the intense heat of reentry?<br> If it doesn't,<br> there'll only be silence.<br> - Mommy, you're squishing me.<br> - Oops, sorry, sweetie.<br> It's okay.<br> Okay, Flight,<br> that's three minutes.<br> - We are standing by for acquisition.<br> - Copy that.<br> Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?<br> Odyssey, this is Houston.<br> Do you read?<br> Expected time of reacquisition,<br> the time when the astronauts were<br> expected to come out of blackout,<br> has come and gone.<br> About all any of us can do now<br> is just listen and hope.<br> We're about to learn whether<br> or not that heat shield,<br> which was damaged<br> by the explosion three days ago,<br> has withstood<br> the inferno of reentry.<br> Odyssey, this is Houston.<br> Do you read me?<br> Odyssey, Houston.<br> Do you read?<br> Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.<br> Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?<br> Odyssey, this is Houston.<br> Do you read me?<br> That's four minutes.<br> Standing by.<br> Odyssey, uh, Houston. Do you read?<br> Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.<br> It's good to see you again.<br> Odyssey, Houston.<br> Welcome home.<br> We're glad to see you.<br> - Good job, Ken. Good job.<br> - Thank you.<br> They made it. They made it.<br> - Yeah!<br> - Lunney.<br> Houston, we're at stable one.<br> The ship is secure.<br> This is Apollo 13 signing off.<br> Good job.<br> Our mission was called<br> a successful failure,<br> in that we returned safely,<br> but never made it to the moon.<br> In the following months,<br> it was determined...<br> that a damaged coil built<br> inside the oxygen tank...<br> sparked during our cryo stir and caused<br> the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.<br> It was a minor defect<br> that occurred two years...<br> before I was named<br> the flight's commander.<br> Fred Haise was going back<br> to the moon on Apollo 18,<br> but his mission was canceled<br> because of budget cuts.<br> He never flew in space again.<br> Nor did Jack Swigert,<br> who left the astronaut corps...<br> and was elected to Congress<br> from the state of Colorado.<br> But he died of cancer before<br> he was able to take office.<br> Ken Mattingly orbited the moon<br> as command module pilot of Apollo 16...<br> and flew the space shuttle,<br> having never gotten the measles.<br> Gene Kranz retired as Director<br> of Flight Operations just not long ago.<br> And many other members of Mission<br> Control have gone on to other things,<br> but some are still there.<br> And as for me...<br> the seven extraordinary days<br> of Apollo 13 were my last in space.<br> I watched other men walk on the moon<br> and return safely,<br> all from the confines of Mission Control<br> and our house in Houston.<br> I sometimes catch myself<br> looking up at the moon,<br> remembering the changes<br> of fortune in our long voyage,<br> thinking of the thousands of people who<br> worked to bring the three of us home.<br> I look up at the moon<br> and wonder...<br> when will we be going back...<br> and who will that be?<br>
