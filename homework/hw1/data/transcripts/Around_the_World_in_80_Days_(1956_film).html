                        To the Bank of England! Quickly!<br> Surround the building!<br> You go that way! You go this way!<br> There he is!<br> - Come on!<br> - After him, men!<br> That way!<br> - He came this way. I'm sure of it.<br> - Come on!<br> Come on, mates! Keep up!<br> Sorry, sir.<br> Today is the day I will finally achieve<br> what has been deemed impossible.<br> Man can break<br> the 50-mile-per-hour speed barrier.<br> And you're lucky<br> to be a part of it, Pierre.<br> - It's Jean Michel, sir.<br> - Yes.<br> We will make history.<br> Or we will die trying.<br> - Die?<br> - This is very exciting.<br> That's it!<br> I refuse to be catapulted,<br> electrocuted, or have my internal organs<br> disrupted any longer!<br> I quit!<br> He is a very sick man!<br> The electrocution was not my fault!<br> You refused to wear<br> the rubber underpants!<br> We're looking for a bank robber.<br> Is there no man brave enough<br> to be my valet?<br> Oh... Aah!<br> I'm your new valet.<br> Uh... I must commend<br> the valet service<br> on their impeccable foresight.<br> But they know I only<br> accept French valets.<br> Yes. Oh! Oui! Oui!<br> I come from a long line<br> of French valets.<br> On my father's side.<br> Very, very French.<br> - But your accent.<br> - My father French. Never speak.<br> My mother Chinese and never shuts up.<br> All the children pick up her accent.<br> Very well.<br> Will you be willing to risk your life<br> to challenge the laws of physics?<br> - Yes. Uh, and I can sing, too.<br> - Excellent. Pop this little hat on.<br> - He's got to be in here.<br> - He's this way!<br> And the throttle in your<br> right hand controls the speed.<br> - How do I stop?<br> - Godspeed!<br> Uh-uh-uh...<br> Twenty-five miles per hour.<br> Yes, the pressure's stable-ish.<br> We need more speed, man.<br> Waah! Wee-yoo!<br> Forty miles per hour.<br> Hang on in there, my good man.<br> Forty-seven.<br> Forty-eight.<br> Forty-nine.<br> Eureka! We've done it!<br> Uh...<br> Waaah!<br> I say, I say. Uh, good morning.<br> - I'm looking for a man with...<br> - Over here!<br> There he is. There's my valet.<br> Sorry! New valet.<br> Whoa!<br> Whoa!<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> You'll be able to let go any second.<br> The pack will run out of steam<br> in exactly three, two, one.<br> Now.<br> Look out!<br> - That was incredible!<br> - We've broken the human speed barrier.<br> Good-bye, sir.<br> It's been very nice valeting for you.<br> Let's... do it again soon.<br> Please, wait!<br> With you as my brave valet,<br> I can test all my inventions.<br> No!<br> Spread out!<br> - Cover that...<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - I take the job.<br> - Splendid!<br> I can't wait to present<br> my results to the Academy.<br> Too kind. Too kind. Thank you.<br> And with this grant to develop<br> new applications for copper wire,<br> Dr. Ramsey invented this.<br> Needless to say,<br> the Royal Academy of Science<br> declared this crackpot<br> mentally incompetent,<br> and he was duly dispatched<br> to a lunatic asylum.<br> Sir. I have an urgent<br> announcement for you. Here.<br> Don't just stand there. Read it.<br> Oh. Um...<br> "It is with great distress<br> that Scotland Yard announces<br> that the Bank of England...<br> has been robbed."<br> My stolen Jade Buddha stolen?<br> You blighter!<br> You gave me every assurance that<br> the Bank of England was impenetrable!<br> Sir, sir, I said, "lmpregnable."<br> It's the same thing, you idiot!<br> Please, please, not the quills!<br> Lord Salisbury!<br> Please contact General Fang<br> and inform her, no Buddha, no deal.<br> To forgo your obligation would<br> be dishonorable, Lord Kelvin.<br> A woman in the Royal Academy?<br> The Jade Buddha was delivered<br> by us to the Bank of England.<br> - What happens while in British hands...<br> - Is absolutely your concern.<br> Colonel Kitchner,<br> chief of Scotland Yard,<br> please inform General Fang<br> what other items were stolen<br> from the bank.<br> Nothing else.<br> Exactly. It seems<br> your little land dispute<br> has spilled over<br> onto our noble shore.<br> Until the Jade Buddha<br> is back in my possession,<br> you and your cause will receive no<br> British military assistance whatsoever.<br> Kitchner.<br> My agents will retrieve the Jade<br> Buddha once again, Lord Kelvin.<br> This time, do not let it<br> slip through your fingers.<br> A female general.<br> What sort of pathetic man<br> takes orders from a woman?<br> Cor!<br> - Come away from here.<br> - Oh, Dad. Can't we stay?<br> My wind-powered pulley system<br> circulates the house with fresh air.<br> Kitchen items are to be placed<br> on the white boat,<br> and the blue is for laundry.<br> But most importantly,<br> this supplies the house<br> with a running current of electricity.<br> Electricity.<br> This is my comprehensive<br> data schedule and list of regulations.<br> It's quite simple. You're never<br> to divert one iota from my plans.<br> I must live my life<br> with total efficiency...<br> to maximize my inventing capacity,<br> thus enabling me to do<br> the most I can for mankind.<br> Uh, Mr. Fogg, you are a noble,<br> precise gentleman.<br> Thank you. Uh... Sorry.<br> What was your name? Ahem.<br> Passport. Too.<br> Passepartout.<br> Bottled light.<br> A miracle.<br> Hardly.<br> Just undiscovered science from<br> an American named Thomas Edison.<br> It turns on with a whistle.<br> Please don't do that.<br> Ah, I see your eye is drawn<br> to what I hope will one day<br> be my crowning achievement.<br> A giant moth?<br> - It's a flying machine.<br> - It can fly?<br> Yes.<br> No. But it will... one day.<br> One day it will transport people<br> through the air.<br> Perhaps over entire oceans.<br> Uh-oh.<br> I'm going to have<br> to make a rule for this.<br> Dear Father:<br> I will find the fastest way<br> back to China...<br> to make our village safe once again.<br> Passepartout?<br> Departure for the Royal Academy<br> of Science in two minutes.<br> Prepare my urban transport device.<br> Prepare my urban transport device.<br> It's the shoes<br> with little wheels on them.<br> It's the shoes<br> with little wheels on them.<br> Clear the way. Clear the way.<br> Mr. Fogg coming through.<br> Watch out! Watch out!<br> Excuse me. Out of way.<br> - Gangway.<br> - Fogg's arrived.<br> - Gangway. Ooh!<br> - Hey!<br> That makes it exactly<br> ten minutes before noon.<br> That will be all.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Today I have proved that man<br> can break the 50-mile-per-hour<br> speed barrier<br> without disrupting<br> his internal organs.<br> Where is your Royal Academy<br> of Science authorization?<br> What am I thinking? What a fool.<br> That would mean that you<br> were a real scientist!<br> By your definition,<br> a real scientist's objective<br> would be to prevent man from progress.<br> We live in a golden age, Fogg.<br> Everything worth discovering<br> has been discovered.<br> Yet ridiculous dreamers<br> like you insist<br> on a past filled with dinosaurs...<br> and evolution.<br> And on a future filled<br> with motorized vehicles,<br> radio waves,<br> and flying machines!<br> Confound it! The bloody<br> Bank of England is a madhouse!<br> Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.<br> An Asian chap.<br> Rumor has it the bloke's a foreigner.<br> Nothing.<br> Yes, I heard it was a Chinese fellow,<br> and he acted alone.<br> No. Actually,<br> they say he was Norwegian.<br> In fact, though, it was a gang<br> of elderly Norwegians.<br> I heard it from a very reliable source<br> that it was a gang<br> of redheaded elderly Norwegians<br> with very tiny feet.<br> It's about time<br> someone robbed that bank.<br> Like this very institution,<br> the Bank of England is outdated.<br> As usual, your contempt<br> for tradition is appalling.<br> You rest on your traditions,<br> if you prefer,<br> but, as with this bank robber,<br> progress waits for no one.<br> So now you're an expert<br> on the bank thief as well.<br> Give us the benefit<br> of your ineffable wisdom, Fogg.<br> Twenty-six minutes ago,<br> a ship left Dover for Paris.<br> From there, the thief<br> takes the Orient Express,<br> where he transfers to a steamer,<br> from Istanbul to India.<br> In little over a month,<br> that man could be in China.<br> If we're to believe Fogg's calculations,<br> he will have circled the globe<br> and returned to England in a fortnight.<br> Actually, by my calculations, it would<br> be closer to, uh, exactly 80 days.<br> Outstanding idea.<br> Well, then, Fogg,<br> let's see you circumnavigate the world<br> in 80 days.<br> I... That would be<br> a fruitless use of my time.<br> I'm on the verge of numerous...<br> countless... scientific breakthroughs.<br> You coward. Admit it.<br> It cannot be done.<br> It can! I could do it.<br> A wager.<br> 10,000.<br> Unlike you and your colleagues,<br> money does not inspire me.<br> I believe every man has his price.<br> Even you, o noble Phileas Fogg.<br> There must be something I could offer<br> that would be worthy of your time.<br> There is. Your position as head<br> of the Royal Academy.<br> I could lead Britain<br> and the rest of the world<br> into a new age of progress<br> and discovery.<br> - Fair enough.<br> - What?<br> I, Lord Kelvin, hereby vow<br> to surrender my position as minister<br> of science to Phileas Fogg...<br> - No!<br> - No! No!<br> if he can circumnavigate<br> the globe...<br> in no more than 80 days.<br> But if he cannot,<br> he must never set foot<br> in this academy again,<br> he must tear down that abhorrent eyesore<br> he calls a laboratory,<br> and he must swear...<br> never to invent again.<br> Just as I always suspected, Fogg.<br> You promise so much, yet you deliver...<br> oh, nothing.<br> - I'll take your wager.<br> - What did you say?<br> I'll take your wager!<br> He did it.<br> Then it's done.<br> A man who has never set foot<br> out of England circling the globe.<br> This is going to be rather amusing.<br> History won't remember your amusement,<br> but it will be hard-pressed to forget<br> the moment I'm standing on the very top<br> step of the Royal Academy of Science.<br> By the strike of noon,<br> after I, Phileas Fogg,<br> have traveled around the world<br> in 80 days!<br> Oh, dear.<br> Mr. Fogg, we all pack and ready to go.<br> Mr. Fogg, are you in here?<br> Phileas! Phileas! Phileas!<br> - Uh...<br> - Mr. Fogg, are you well, sir?<br> Huh?<br> Uh, Passepartout.<br> Would you... sit with me a moment?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I risked everything,<br> my entire life's work.<br> For something you believe in.<br> Nothing could make<br> more sense than that, sir.<br> You are honorable, Passepartout.<br> But I'm afraid this was<br> a calamitous lapse of judgment.<br> - Mr. Fogg?<br> - Yes?<br> - Let your family...<br> - There is no one left to tell.<br> This house and my inventions<br> are all I have.<br> And a brave French valet that will help<br> you make it around the world in 80 days.<br> - You really believe we can succeed?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes. Yes. Yes!<br> You're mad. We'll be sliced to pieces<br> before we reach India.<br> We're with you, sir!<br> Good luck!<br> Halt!<br> - Quite a contraption here, Mr. Fogg.<br> - Thank you, Inspector.<br> But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to detain<br> you and your valet until further notice.<br> This here doohickey is in violation<br> of the city's new vehicle code.<br> Vehicle code?<br> Code 431.<br> All vehicles<br> must be powered by horses.<br> Or other indigenous<br> quadruped creatures of the like,<br> excluding giraffes and...<br> You're driveling. Stand aside.<br> I'm about to embark upon<br> a journey around the world.<br> Not in this monstrosity,<br> you're not. No!<br> - Mm-mm.<br> - That's hot.<br> It's... Ow!<br> Time to go.<br> We have a boat to catch.<br> Stealing a police vehicle is not<br> an acceptable way to begin our journey.<br> - Not stealing. Borrowing.<br> - Excuse us.<br> We're borrowing this vehicle<br> to catch our ship to Paris,<br> if someone could inform<br> the appropriate authorities.<br> Bloody hell! Me brain's leakin'!<br> Ahh! Damn that nincompoop Fix.<br> What's the point of hiring<br> a corrupt police officer<br> if he can't abuse the law properly?<br> - Kitchner.<br> - Sir!<br> Tell Fix to pack his bags.<br> - He's going on a trip.<br> - Right away, sir.<br> Hmm. Smart man.<br> Passepartout, tell this<br> impudent fellow we must<br> leave within six and a half hours, or we<br> miss our connection in Constantinople.<br> Yes, sir. Please.<br> We are in a great hurry.<br> - Passepartout?<br> - Yes?<br> In French.<br> Sacre bleu, la champignon,<br> chateau, bien, franoise, voil,<br> ooh-la-la, foie de gras.<br> - What did he say?<br> - Uh...<br> He say...<br> - What?<br> - He says not to worry.<br> The next train will leave in five hours.<br> Good time for sightseeing.<br> Passepartout, this is<br> a scientific expedition, not a holiday!<br> I will not miss this train.<br> Ah!<br> - Very amazing.<br> - What?<br> What does it say?<br> Eddie Thomason will be<br> showing his inventions.<br> Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?<br> What a chance for you<br> to meet another great inventor.<br> I would quite like to tell him<br> about my whistle modification.<br> Good idea.<br> See? Exposition. Science.<br> I assure you these are not<br> the works of Thomas Edison.<br> Uh, I think he is<br> somewhere around here.<br> Wait a moment. This isn't science.<br> This is art.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hmm.<br> That painting is highly inaccurate.<br> It's not supposed<br> to be accurate.<br> The artist views reality<br> through imagination<br> rather than simply recording it.<br> It is called "lmpressionism."<br> Well, um, I'm not impressed.<br> Trees are not violet,<br> grass is not charcoal,<br> and a man cannot...<br> fly.<br> You feel something.<br> You dream of flying.<br> Or of naked men.<br> - Sometimes.<br> - Ah.<br> The flying. N-N-Not the men.<br> I am glad you like my painting.<br> Monique La Roche.<br> Phileas Fogg. I must say, it's a lot<br> better than these amateurs.<br> What did he say?<br> Oh, no.<br> Non.<br> Goodness. What was that all about?<br> Well, a wealthy gentleman<br> bought my painting for a lot of money.<br> Champagne for everyone!<br> I'm still looking for Mr. Eddie.<br> Nice painting.<br> Have you considered<br> a career in schematic drawing?<br> No. It would be far too limiting.<br> At least your work<br> shows genuine promise.<br> Thank you. Those I painted<br> many months ago.<br> I was lacking inspiration.<br> I found some men<br> to help me find Mr. "Edimon."<br> - This way.<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> He's very eager.<br> Get him!<br> Oh, no, no, no, no.<br> Oh, it's terrible, no?<br> No, no, it's...<br> - clever.<br> - Oh.<br> Hmm. Yes.<br> - He's a clown.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> And yet...<br> he's incredibly angry.<br> The irony is, uh, terrifying.<br> - Is that good?<br> - Is it?<br> Ah, this is interesting.<br> Without opposable thumbs,<br> a dog could never play poker.<br> Yes, they can.<br> Where have you seen<br> a dog playing poker?<br> Right there.<br> Perhaps I'm not the best judge.<br> Bandits! They come to take away<br> all the paintings!<br> - Quickly! Come this way!<br> - Passepartout!<br> Go, go, go!<br> Thank you, Miss La Roche.<br> You may just have saved our trip.<br> - There you are.<br> - I would, uh...<br> - I would like to repay you.<br> - Take me with you.<br> - What?<br> - I'm stifled here. Pigeonholed.<br> They think of me only<br> as a coat-check girl!<br> - Why?<br> - Because I am the coat-check girl.<br> - Ah.<br> - Look.<br> The leading art critic in Paris.<br> Look what he wrote<br> about one of my paintings.<br> - I can't read this. It's French.<br> - I wish I couldn't.<br> Why do you carry it?<br> When I do succeed,<br> I can throw it in his face, but for now,<br> I need a world journey to inspire me.<br> I'm inspired to get us<br> back on schedule.<br> Let's see. Wind velocity<br> approximately twelve knots,<br> factoring in air density...<br> Outstanding!<br> Passepartout, onward! Ah.<br> There we go. Passepartout,<br> tell him to keep the change.<br> Uh...<br> fromage, por favor.<br> We are going around<br> the world in 80 days!<br> The balloon cannot<br> support all this weight!<br> Your hot air should compensate, no?<br> Get off!<br> - What are they doing?<br> - They're being disorderly.<br> Hey! Let go! Let go!<br> Hey! Passepartout!<br> My valise! It has all my money in it.<br> Hey, lady, lady, lady! It's my bag.<br> No, that is my bag.<br> No, that's not your bag. It's my bag!<br> - No!<br> - You crazy.<br> Yes.<br> That tickles!<br> You took my bag.<br> Mr. Fogg!<br> - Good catch!<br> - Thank you.<br> Ooh!<br> Those are the gallery bandits.<br> Oh, yes!<br> Ah.<br> He stole my purse!<br> This devil stole my purse!<br> My bag! He took my... Ah!<br> - We've stolen that old lady's purse.<br> - Huh. Here.<br> We must help Passepartout.<br> How do I make this go lower?<br> What are you doing?<br> Decrease the overall weight...<br> - That's not going to work.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> Physics, no?<br> Yes.<br> Ahhh...<br> Bonjour.<br> Bonjour.<br> - Eh?<br> - Bye-bye!<br> Wake up, lady! Wake up, lady!<br> Wake up! Lady, wake up!<br> - Bye, mama.<br> - Merci.<br> Bye, baby.<br> Ohh...<br> Very impressive. I'd have let go by now.<br> The statue's grabbing his trousers.<br> I don't think it's doing it on purpose.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Help!<br> Well done, Passepartout.<br> We're still on schedule<br> despite those dogged thieves.<br> Yes, yes. Thank you.<br> Those art thieves<br> seemed to recognize you.<br> - I look like someone they know.<br> - Some other Frenchman, perhaps?<br> - So, where can we drop you off?<br> - We're not stopping.<br> Once we land to board<br> the Orient Express, you are free to go.<br> Thank you so much.<br> - For what?<br> - I'm free to go with you.<br> I did not say you were free to come.<br> - I said you were free to go.<br> - Where?<br> - Anywhere.<br> - Thank you. I will go with you.<br> - No, you will not, Miss La Roche.<br> - Monique.<br> Miss... Monique!<br> There! Now we are getting along.<br> Comme c'est beau.<br> C'est magnifique.<br> Toutes ces couleurs.<br> Look at the sunrise.<br> There is only one word for it.<br> - "Magical."<br> - Miss La Roche!<br> I refuse to allow you<br> to continue traveling with us.<br> I'm not traveling with you.<br> I'm making my own way.<br> Maybe you shouldn't travel with me.<br> This is what happens<br> when you leave your home.<br> You meet... people!<br> Why are you keeping up this ruse?<br> Perhaps I should inform Mr. Fogg,<br> and together he and I can speculate.<br> A very sacred object<br> was stolen from my village.<br> I have taken it back.<br> Incroyable.<br> For many centuries, the Jade Buddha<br> has protected my people.<br> It has never left our village until now.<br> And those art thieves. Who are they?<br> The Black Scorpions.<br> They work for an evil warlord. Fang.<br> She wants the Buddha<br> so she can take over my village.<br> I must return the Jade Buddha<br> to protect Lanzhou.<br> Mr. Fogg is the fastest way.<br> Perhaps, then,<br> we can help one another.<br> I will keep your secret,<br> and you convince Mr. Fogg<br> to allow me to travel<br> the world with you.<br> Keep this Dummkopf in his seat,<br> or we throw him off!<br> Merely pointing out if they coordinated<br> their coal-shoveling technique,<br> they could maximize our speed.<br> When we reach Constantinople, I suggest<br> you board a train we are not on.<br> - Uh, Mr. Fogg, she must come with us.<br> - And why is that?<br> Uh, we just discovered that we are<br> related from the same family.<br> I'm her father's second cousin's sister<br> on my mother's side. French.<br> Monsieur Fogg. If I make the train<br> go faster, I can come with you, oui?<br> Yes.<br> I bid you farewell, Miss La Roche.<br> If there's anything else you would like,<br> just let us know, Miss La Roche.<br> Ah! Voil.<br> Champagne with your first-class seats,<br> Mademoiselle La Roche.<br> Merci.<br> - Champagne?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Merci.<br> - Monsieur.<br> A tea?<br> Okay.<br> How to make English tea.<br> Precisely 96 degrees.<br> Ooh.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> - Fogg's valet!<br> - A jade Buddha!<br> - This is not a jade Buddha.<br> - Oh, yes, it is!<br> - You're right. But I'm not a valet.<br> Oh. Really?<br> Owww!<br> Me bloody nose!<br> Let me in!<br> You're gonna pay for scorchin' me willy!<br> Heh-heh-heh-heh. Now I gotcha.<br> Ow! Oh! Ow!<br> Ahhh!<br> You're under arrest!<br> Ah! Ooh! Ow!<br> Sorry!<br> Why the devil are we stopping?<br> Prince Hapi would be honored<br> to have Fogg<br> and his traveling companions<br> at his banquet.<br> How very flattering.<br> But please inform Prince "Happy"<br> that we are on a very tight schedule.<br> Prince Hapi demands it.<br> Then Prince Hapi<br> will have to get accustomed<br> to not getting everything he wants.<br> It is magnificent.<br> Mr. Fogg, his house<br> is even bigger than yours.<br> His collection, his taste...<br> It is exquisite.<br> Yes, it is.<br> Not good.<br> Very old. Look. Broken.<br> And where is His Highness?<br> Oh. The prince is also<br> a talented musician.<br> If I did nothing<br> but lounge about the palace,<br> I'd learn to pluck a few notes.<br> Let's make this brief.<br> I'll pose for photographs,<br> wearing a turban,<br> holding an atlas...<br> Mademoiselle.<br> How magical that our paths should cross.<br> Do you believe in fate?<br> Is that what you call it<br> when one stops a train<br> and kidnaps its passengers?<br> Phileas Fogg.<br> Please forgive me,<br> but I feel like Aphrodite herself<br> descended to Earth.<br> What is a ravishing<br> woman like you...<br> - I never think when I'm naked.<br> - I do. In the bath.<br> - Yes. Well, I mean...<br> - No!<br> Don't touch it!<br> - That is my most treasured possession.<br> - I was only pointing. I was just...<br> Don't even point.<br> Rodin.<br> Yes. A Rodin.<br> Oh.<br> I have never seen a more beautiful...<br> muscular form.<br> Well, I can assure you,<br> I'm in much better shape now.<br> Incroyable. It is a sculpture of you!<br> Yes.<br> "Hapi Birthday.<br> Your pal, Rodin."<br> - Come, my dear. Let us dine.<br> - Yes.<br> Ah, Mr. Fogg, please join us.<br> No, sorry. We are on a tight schedule.<br> We will join you, actually.<br> But just one drink.<br> After the duke and the duchess<br> sat down in the bath,<br> I realized I forgot<br> to put on my bathing suit.<br> I'm such a fool.<br> Always embarrassing myself<br> in front of visiting dignitaries.<br> But you know how that can be,<br> right, Phil?<br> Uh, yes.<br> Uh, it's Phileas, actually.<br> So, Foggy, tell me.<br> I heard you're an inventor.<br> Well, I try to apply myself<br> to thinking of new ways<br> to help better mankind,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> Well, I'm not an inventor,<br> but I did develop a new way<br> of irrigating dry land<br> so that no one in my kingdom<br> ever has to be hungry.<br> Oh.<br> Mr. Fogg invented wheelie shoes.<br> Not now, Passepartout.<br> Oh.<br> Mmm.<br> - Miss La Roche.<br> - Hmm?<br> It is mesmerizing,<br> the way your face illuminates.<br> Oh...<br> Her discoloration could be<br> an allergic reaction<br> or a mild form of hives.<br> Although I've noticed a certain<br> luminescent glow about her<br> complexion when she's drawing.<br> And sometimes, when she's...<br> concentrating on her latest work,<br> her ears will actually flutter.<br> - It's rather fetching.<br> - Guess who else was in this bath.<br> U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes.<br> Shouldn't we be going?<br> We have a schedule to keep.<br> Thank you for your hospitality.<br> It's been absolutely fascinating,<br> but I'm afraid we must push on.<br> Yes.<br> Very well.<br> The gentlemen are free to go.<br> But Miss La Roche...<br> stays here with me.<br> - To be my wife.<br> - Hmm?<br> Yes. Wife number seven.<br> - You have seven wives?<br> - One for each day of the week.<br> - This is absolutely ridiculous!<br> - No more talk!<br> Prince Hapi has spoken!<br> Well, we did say one drink.<br> Passepartout, we're leaving.<br> I can tell when we're not wanted.<br> Monsieur Fogg!<br> Do Tuesdays work for you?<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Thank you!<br> No!<br> Halt!<br> Or Hapi gets smashed!<br> Please! Anything but my statue of me!<br> Miss La Roche,<br> please join us, if you will.<br> - All of you, drop your weapons.<br> - Do as he says!<br> - Get in the tent.<br> - Everybody!<br> - Now!<br> - Let's go. Come on.<br> Now, take off your clothes<br> and throw them... Uh...<br> I assure you the statue is not<br> armed... harmed in any way.<br> Get them!<br> His arm!<br> Thank you, Phileas.<br> That was very heroic.<br> Yes, and needlessly time-consuming.<br> This is exactly why<br> I should never have let you come along.<br> Kill them!<br> I want my arm!<br> No!<br> Sir! I've received a telegram<br> from Inspector Fix.<br> - A-ha!<br> - According to him,<br> the bank thief and Fogg's valet<br> are the same man.<br> Fogg doesn't realize<br> he's transporting the bank thief!<br> Or does he?<br> He did leave town in quite a hurry.<br> Wouldn't you say, Lord Rhodes?<br> Indeed, Lord Salisbury.<br> Eh, evading arrest,<br> stealing a police vehicle,<br> sounds rather incriminating to me.<br> One can almost deduce<br> this entire bet was merely a ruse<br> to facilitate his escape.<br> - Don't you agree, Lord Kelvin?<br> - Yes.<br> Brilliant, Lord Salisbury.<br> I shall name a beef-related entre<br> after you in your honor! Kitchner!<br> - Sir!<br> - Inform your men at Scotland Yard<br> that Phileas Fogg is without a doubt<br> the man who robbed the Bank of England!<br> - Where are they now?<br> - They're taking a train across India,<br> from Bombay to Calcutta.<br> Thank God we own India!<br> I want their faces<br> in every police station,<br> army barracks, post office,<br> railway station and outhouse in India!<br> We're going to stop Fogg<br> and get my Jade Buddha back<br> by any means necessary!<br> Agra is where we will capture them!<br> Intercept them at Agra!<br> Carry on, Cutter!<br> Move it! Move it! Fall in!<br> And they were<br> the greatest kung fu boxers.<br> Ten Tigers of Canton.<br> Brothers in arms.<br> They fought to keep order<br> and justice in China.<br> The most famous of Ten Tigers<br> is Wong Fei Hung.<br> Armed with<br> only bamboo sticks...<br> It's salivating on... please.<br> Is this your goat?<br> Did they really fight like tigers?<br> Each Tiger have their own<br> animal fighting style.<br> Like tiger.<br> Snake. Snake head, snake tail,<br> snake mouth, snake tongue!<br> Where are my calculations?<br> Monkey!<br> The goat! Passepartout, I'm being<br> attacked by a ferocious animal!<br> - It has small horns.<br> - Sorry, Mr. Fogg.<br> Please keep that inconsiderate<br> beast away from me.<br> And refrain from ridiculous anecdotes.<br> Why do you not like his story, Mr. Frog?<br> It's Fogg. Phileas Fogg.<br> How could a man learn to defend himself<br> by watching animals behave like...<br> - animals?<br> - It is famous legend.<br> - A ridiculous legend.<br> - Most legends are born from truth.<br> Yes.<br> But all truths are born from facts.<br> Solid, tangible facts<br> that can be calculated<br> and written down on paper.<br> And then eaten by a goat.<br> Mr. Feelsillious,<br> when I tell the story<br> of the man who circled<br> the entire world in 80 days,<br> would that not be a legend?<br> Only if the man's name<br> was Feelsillious Frog.<br> - What the blazes is it now?<br> - Come this way! Come on!<br> Look sharp, now. Get 'em!<br> Find these men!<br> Uh-oh. Time to go. They seem to think<br> we robbed the Bank of England.<br> Preposterous. This is a desperate<br> attempt by Lord Kelvin<br> to impede my journey.<br> I am a British citizen.<br> I have nothing to fear.<br> Except bullets.<br> Listen up!<br> Have you seen these men?<br> Come on!<br> Any word on the bank thieves, sir?<br> They were on the train.<br> Keep your rifles ready.<br> They won't get past us, sir!<br> Ladies, have you seen these two men?<br> Look closely. They're very dangerous.<br> They're everywhere!<br> This is not going to work!<br> - Just act like ladies.<br> - Not a problem.<br> Hello. Hello! Ah.<br> - I feel faint.<br> - Phileas, women are not that weak!<br> No, but I am.<br> Hello, darling.<br> What can I do for you, eh?<br> What nice hand,<br> nice eye, nice hair...<br> Hang about!<br> Mr. Fogg, what are you doing?<br> This is no time to sleep.<br> Stop, stop.<br> Go, go, go! Get us out of Agra quickly.<br> Passepartout, we did it.<br> Hey, wrong way.<br> Ah!<br> Phileas? No! No!<br> Aah! Run! Run, Passepartout!<br> Ah! Ah!<br> Ahhh!<br> Fogg's valet! Heh!<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Now I gotcha!<br> Hand over the Jade Buddha!<br> Oh!<br> You're under arrest! Whoa!<br> Watch me plums! Ooh!<br> Now you get him very mad! Let's go.<br> Stop, or I'll arrest you as well!<br> Run!<br> - Which way?<br> - Down!<br> Again!<br> Down!<br> Jump!<br> - Go, go, go!<br> - What's upsetting him?<br> - He wants the Jade Buddha!<br> - Then give it to him!<br> - Phileas, wake up!<br> - Please, please. You must go.<br> - My husband will be home soon.<br> - Phileas!<br> Ow! Ay!<br> Phileas, help!<br> Leave her alone! I'll protect you!<br> Ah!<br> I'm here, my dear.<br> Uh, that stumble was<br> simply to buy me time.<br> This cane is not as it appears.<br> If I depress this button, it would<br> deploy a weapon more deadly than yours.<br> This... is...<br> a strange knife.<br> Isn't it a sextant?<br> Yes.<br> Huh.<br> - Are you all right, my dear?<br> - Phileas, that was so unlike you. Ah!<br> You men, come with me!<br> You'd better put this on.<br> Perhaps I should wear<br> women's clothing more often.<br> Oh.<br> We should run.<br> - What, now?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Yes, we should run.<br> - Break down the door!<br> - Okay.<br> No, not me brains!<br> - Give me the Jade "Bu-ddha"!<br> - Okay, okay.<br> What's "Bu-ddha"?<br> Get ready to jump! Now!<br> It is him, the Englishman<br> who robbed the Bank of England!<br> He's escaping in that palkee-garry!<br> Hey, there he is!<br> They'll check all trains heading east.<br> If we could make it to the coast, we<br> can't sail into Singapore or Hong Kong.<br> - They're both British colonies.<br> - Does England own everything in Asia?<br> Not China. Not yet.<br> Passepartout?<br> - You look troubled.<br> - I cannot keep lying to Mr. Fogg.<br> You did what you had to.<br> The fate of your village<br> is of far greater importance<br> than any bet Phileas has made.<br> If he loses, all it will<br> cost him his money and pride.<br> No, Mr. Fogg will lose<br> much more than that.<br> What do you mean?<br> My village!<br> - Your village?<br> - Uh... I mean,<br> my, what a village!<br> Oh, it's beautiful!<br> We do need to stop and<br> resupply, but we must be off by morning.<br> - Lau Xing, Lau Xing.<br> - Lau Xing, Lau Xing.<br> Lau Xing.<br> - Lau Xing.<br> - Lau Xing.<br> Goodness, that's quite a welcome.<br> Do these people know him?<br> It must be their custom,<br> the way they welcome all strangers.<br> - Lau Xing.<br> - Lau Xing.<br> Whoo!<br> Lau Xing.<br> Lau Xing.<br> Lau Xing.<br> Ah. Uh...<br> Oh. It's beautiful.<br> You are very talented.<br> Thank you.<br> You need more blue.<br> Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.<br> Sorry?<br> Vile.<br> Absolutely vile.<br> Welcome home, Lau Xing.<br> Your brothers will be proud.<br> The whole notion of<br> a lighter-than-air craft cannot work,<br> unless you can<br> harness the power of helium.<br> Or hydrogen, which is far better...<br> Yes, well, couldn't have<br> put it better myself.<br> As for this Englishman, do you think<br> such an association is wise?<br> He is the most disciplined man<br> I have ever met.<br> The crane!<br> The monkey. Very frightening.<br> Snake.<br> And, of course, the eagle.<br> Phileas?<br> Phileas, I made this for you.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.<br> What does this say?<br> Stupid.<br> Lau Xing...<br> I've had quite enough.<br> I just... I...<br> Ahhh.<br> I am going to be abominably ill.<br> I... I want to die.<br> Please kill me.<br> "Dear Father:<br> I will find the fastest way to China."<br> It's strong.<br> Mr. Fogg, I was going to tell you.<br> - This is your family.<br> - My name is not Passepartout.<br> It is Lau Xing.<br> - I robbed the Bank of England.<br> - You robbed the Bank of England?<br> Not for gold or money,<br> but for the Jade Buddha.<br> It was stolen from our village.<br> Phileas, he had no other choice.<br> This was his only way to get home.<br> - You knew about this?<br> - Well...<br> I have nothing but respect<br> for you, Mr. Fogg.<br> Then respect my deductive reasoning.<br> You have both used me.<br> You to escape to China,<br> and you to travel to further<br> your impressionistic humbug!<br> Your overtures of... comradeship,<br> of friendship, of...<br> All that was a means to ensure<br> I would take you along.<br> My entire life,<br> I got along splendidly by myself.<br> You've been pebbles in my shoe,<br> slowing me down, endangering my life,<br> risking everything,<br> all I've ever lived for.<br> And you!<br> You knew that.<br> Don't let him go.<br> He'll be lost by midnight.<br> Go!<br> More of your relatives, I suppose.<br> You can just forget<br> about a reference.<br> I beg a thousand pardons, Mr. Fogg.<br> What's he screaming about?<br> He's saying, "Please, let me go.<br> I'm bored."<br> Why is he in prison?<br> Urinating in public.<br> Charming.<br> At least he had the decency<br> to be forthcoming about it.<br> Is there anything you've told me<br> that's even remotely true?<br> I really can sing.<br> # Frre Jacques, Frre Jacques<br> # Dormez-vous<br> # Dormez-vous<br> # Sonnez les matines<br> Sonnez les matines<br> # Ding, ding, ding<br> Ding, ding, ding #<br> Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.<br> Ding, dang, dong.<br> Look!<br> Oh, good. Here comes<br> Mr. Grumpy and the Leatherettes.<br> - Where is the Jade Buddha?<br> - You are better off killing me.<br> You have nerve.<br> Are your comrades so brave?<br> Your threats don't frighten me.<br> Nor does your silly bracelet.<br> All right. It's not silly.<br> I spit on you! France spits on you!<br> Vive I'Anjou!<br> - Your turn will come soon enough.<br> - Coward!<br> Leave them alone. Fight me.<br> Yes, fight him.<br> Let's see how ferocious you really are.<br> Hey, that's cheating!<br> - Look out!<br> - Huh?<br> Left!<br> Behind you!<br> No!<br> - Hit them!<br> - Silence!<br> You savages!<br> Phileas, help him!<br> - Watch out on the right.<br> - Huh?<br> No, my right.<br> Stop helping me!<br> What's happening?<br> Where is Passepartout?<br> How is he getting on?<br> I wouldn't say he's winning,<br> but, uh, I think he's doing all right.<br> Go home to mama.<br> Huh?<br> - What took you so long?<br> - I had to finish my lunch.<br> Wong Fei Hung!<br> Surely you're not foolish enough<br> to take on all of my men by yourself?<br> Ten Tigers?<br> Kill them!<br> Execute the prisoners!<br> I want their heads on pikes!<br> What's happening?<br> Phileas!<br> Ohhh!<br> Passepartout... Knife!<br> - Merci.<br> - You're welcome.<br> You promise me that Black Scorpions<br> will never come back to Lanzhou.<br> These are my brothers and sister.<br> The Ten Tigers.<br> - But there are only nine.<br> - Including me.<br> They're real.<br> The legend was true.<br> - Mr. Fogg...<br> - Passepartout,<br> or whatever your name is,<br> save your apologies.<br> Phileas, he risked his life<br> for what he believes in.<br> If anyone understands that, you do.<br> Please ensure Miss La Roche<br> finds safe passage home.<br> This should be adequate.<br> Oh.<br> I, uh, believe this is your veil.<br> I will never dress like a woman again.<br> Ever.<br> Mr. Fogg.<br> Please let me help you win your bet.<br> I have secured the services<br> of a more reliable gentleman.<br> Yes. Well, perhaps I'll just, uh,<br> travel alone.<br> Fifi La Belle!<br> She sings! She dances!<br> She does the dance of the...<br> You, sir, come right in.<br> See Miss Fifi La Belle in all her...<br> Ah, the most modern city in the world.<br> Finally, civilization.<br> Excuse me. Pardon me.<br> Can anyone direct me<br> to the Pacific Railroad Station?<br> Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.<br> I'm such a... rutabaga sometimes.<br> No, no, no.<br> Please, it's my fault entirely.<br> - Let me, uh...<br> - Oh... Ah!<br> Oh. Oh, Lord,<br> I think I sprained my knee.<br> Uh! Ooh.<br> I should find you a physician.<br> There's a doctor who has<br> an office around the corner.<br> Excellent.<br> Well, uh, I'll get him for you.<br> Thank you.<br> There should be more people<br> like you in this world.<br> Whoo, doggy! Jackpot!<br> Whoo!<br> Mon Dieu.<br> Can you imagine Phileas alone<br> in a place like this?<br> I'm sure he's fine.<br> Alms.<br> Alms.<br> Alms for the poor?<br> Arms?<br> You already got arms.<br> It's money you need.<br> I can't even scrounge proficiently.<br> Hey.<br> Cheer up, pal. You just gotta<br> figure out what'll work for you.<br> Now, what makes you<br> different from them?<br> I'm hungry and miserable.<br> No. You stink.<br> Your stink is your most powerful weapon<br> in your begging arsenal.<br> Watch this.<br> Hey.<br> - Give me money.<br> - Sure. Don't touch me. You stink.<br> - That guy smells like a dead horse!<br> - I'm not proud of it.<br> Simple, yet effective.<br> - Yeah, I see.<br> - You try.<br> Give it a shot. I got faith in you.<br> Excuse me. Now, uh, you...<br> Ah.<br> I'm not gonna lie to you.<br> That's gonna happen about half the time.<br> It's a volume business.<br> - Hunk of cheese?<br> - Oh, yes, I would rather...<br> Maybe later.<br> What are them drawings?<br> You some kind of devil worshipper?<br> Don't you be putting a hex on me.<br> I'll cut you.<br> - I'm an inventor.<br> - That's nice.<br> Or, rather, I was.<br> One day I will build a machine<br> that will allow man to fly.<br> Flying men? Where?<br> - Nowhere.<br> - Where are the flying men?<br> - Where are the flying men?<br> - Over there.<br> The bird men are coming! I knew it!<br> The bird men are coming!<br> The bird men are coming!<br> The birds! The bird men!<br> Bird men! Birds!<br> "I traveled the world for inspiration<br> and found it in a man...<br> who lives what he dreams."<br> - Phileas?<br> - No.<br> Passepartout! Monique!<br> Mr. Fogg.<br> You crossed the Pacific Ocean.<br> For me?<br> - We will help you win your bet.<br> - Mr. Fogg, I would never let you down.<br> - But why would you do this?<br> - Because you are our friend,<br> and perhaps... more.<br> More with her. You and me?<br> We just stick with friends.<br> - Ooh.<br> - Oof!<br> Lord Kelvin, I can<br> offer you something much more precious<br> than a single Jade Buddha.<br> Beneath Lanzhou are a series<br> of untapped jade reserves.<br> If the town were to be overrun,<br> those reserves would be ours.<br> I see.<br> However, should Phileas Fogg<br> win this race,<br> I will have neither the power nor<br> the means to hand over any arsenal.<br> Then I will see to it personally<br> that Mr. Fogg's journey is cut short.<br> Very well.<br> Let us consider our deal to be...<br> Still, it's a first-rate idea, sir.<br> What's this blocking my jade reserves?<br> That will have to be demolished.<br> But that is<br> the Great Wall of China, sir.<br> But that is<br> the Great Wall of China, sir.<br> It's not that great.<br> Passepartout went<br> to get help hours ago.<br> What if he's lost, or...<br> Don't fret, my dear.<br> Passepartout's a warrior<br> with impeccable survival instincts.<br> No doubt he'll return with help, and we<br> will board our train with time to spare.<br> Agua.<br> Perhaps I'm being a little optimistic.<br> Help!<br> - Help us!<br> - Help!<br> Ah! A rattlesnake!<br> Help!<br> I don't want to die!<br> Ah. Good morning.<br> - Howdy.<br> - Hey.<br> Crazy English cowboy wannabe man.<br> How's about going someplace else?<br> You're blocking the path.<br> Wilbur, it's him.<br> I'll be damned.<br> Mr. Fogg, my name is Orville Wright.<br> This is my brother, Wilbur.<br> - We're big fans of yours.<br> - Fan's a strong word.<br> Better way to say it's we got a lot<br> of money riding on you to win your bet.<br> We're gonna use<br> our winnings to build this.<br> Orville, maybe now is not the time.<br> Let me explain it to Mr. Fogg.<br> Just one second. Forgive my brother.<br> He's got his head up in the clouds.<br> He's one of these dreamers who thinks<br> man's gonna go swooshing around<br> on the planet<br> like a little hummingbird.<br> Yeah, we're all gonna fly.<br> He thinks so, too.<br> It's kind of sad. I'm sorry.<br> He's kind of a moron.<br> He's mastered the cable steering system.<br> The drag-and-lift ratio.<br> - This is brilliant.<br> - Thank you.<br> That's what I've been saying,<br> but Orville doesn't listen.<br> All that stuff about mastering...<br> That's what I say.<br> You gotta have faith in me, no matter<br> how crazy big brother's dreams sound.<br> - But you told me...<br> - You gotta have confidence.<br> - You've got to speak up and support me.<br> - Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> Have you come across our friend<br> on your way here?<br> Who are we looking for?<br> Passepartout.<br> You mean the crazy,<br> half-naked Chinese guy<br> we saw running around,<br> where he was like...<br> - Singing "Frre Jacques"?<br> - With a cow skull on his head?<br> - Possibly.<br> - Yes.<br> - He's in the back of the wagon.<br> - Passepartout.<br> - You are alive!<br> - Is that you, Grandma?<br> - Bye-bye.<br> - Good luck. Go win the bet.<br> - No pressure, but you gotta win it.<br> - Bye.<br> Now, you see, to get the real<br> classy dames, you gotta invent stuff.<br> I did.<br> "I did"? What's with the "I did"?<br> We're the Wright Brothers.<br> We did. Now go.<br> Hyah!<br> They're not going to make it!<br> Ah-ha-ha! New York, New York!<br> So much to see! So little time!<br> Our steamer leaves in ten minutes!<br> Go, go, go! Go, go, go!<br> - We're never going to make it.<br> - Phileas Fogg?<br> Autograph this for me?<br> It's for the wife.<br> Certainly. This business about me<br> robbing the Bank of England...<br> Ah, I'm from Ireland. Nice goin'.<br> The boat. Follow me.<br> I know a shortcut. Make a lane!<br> Make a lane!<br> Where are we?<br> - Ah!<br> - Whoa!<br> - That's a big man.<br> - It is a lady. A French lady.<br> She looks like an evil<br> Chinese warlord to me.<br> Your journey has caused<br> quite a stir, Mr. Fogg,<br> but I'm afraid it ends here.<br> Leave them alone.<br> This has nothing to do with them.<br> On the contrary, Lau Xing,<br> Lord Kelvin and I have made<br> new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.<br> Unfortunately for Mr. Fogg,<br> they entail his... permanent detour.<br> I knew Kelvin was duplicitous,<br> but to align himself<br> with such a little scoundrel!<br> You're not a scoundrel,<br> but you are quite small!<br> As in petite, but most definitely lethal<br> and generally very scary.<br> One, two...<br> - Go!<br> - Three!<br> - Go up there.<br> - Stop them.<br> Passepartout, my cane!<br> Uh, there.<br> Passepartout!<br> Help! We are trapped!<br> Help!<br> Passepartout! Help!<br> There you are!<br> You have a knife in your buttock.<br> It's the evil Chinese warlord!<br> - Ooh!<br> - Huh?<br> She's coming!<br> The boat!<br> Up there! Hurry! Go, go, go!<br> Go, Mr. Fogg. There's not much time.<br> Wait, wait! What am I thinking?<br> Passepartout can't defeat them.<br> He's nine Tigers short.<br> Phileas, I do believe you are becoming<br> the man of my dreams.<br> When this is over,<br> let's hope the arms and legs<br> of the man of your dreams<br> are still attached to the torso...<br> of the man of your dreams.<br> - You have failed to stop him.<br> - Then your death will have to suffice.<br> Let go of me!<br> The book! It's going to fall!<br> How can we save...<br> - Phileas?<br> - I will save him...<br> Wah!<br> Mr. Fogg!<br> No!<br> Oh. Passepartout?<br> Passepartout!<br> - Huh?<br> - You're alive!<br> Are you injured?<br> Yes, well, uh...<br> Rules are made to be broken.<br> Or, uh, stabbed by a spiky shoe.<br> Mr. Fogg, you missed the ship.<br> You'll lose your bet.<br> Oh. At least I didn't lose a friend.<br> You must be the eleventh Tiger.<br> Meow!<br> - Let's go. We must catch the next ship.<br> - It would never reach London in time.<br> No. No! No!<br> We are not giving up!<br> I almost died! You almost died!<br> We take the next ship<br> and win that bet!<br> Very well.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Yes!<br> Thank you.<br> Yes. Yes! Yes!<br> Oh, it's hopeless.<br> By those calculations,<br> I'm still behind by one day.<br> - There must be some way!<br> - Phileas Fogg on my boat?<br> What an honor, sir!<br> I've quite a penny wagered on you.<br> The wife's none too happy about it.<br> Then again, she hasn't cracked a smile<br> since that shark almost devoured me.<br> Got 'em both in one bite.<br> Ah, it's Inspector Fix!<br> My goodness! He made it<br> around the world before Fogg!<br> I came back from India<br> the short way, you ninny!<br> I take it you don't have<br> Phileas Fogg in that valise.<br> A little Jade Buddha, perhaps?<br> That's the last<br> of the coal, Captain.<br> Mr. Fogg.<br> I'm sorry to say,<br> we've burnt the last of the coal.<br> But I've had a word with the crew,<br> and all of them...<br> have agreed to burn their shoes.<br> The effort is appreciated, Captain.<br> Unfortunately,<br> we've gained a mere six hours.<br> - Even shoes cannot help us now.<br> - Must be something we can do.<br> That's it.<br> I've got it.<br> Birds.<br> Excellent idea! We'll burn birds!<br> No, we'll fly to London.<br> We follow the laws of physics<br> mastered by the birds millennia ago<br> and combine it with the Wright<br> Brothers' steering system.<br> Most people would laugh at you.<br> But not us. We care about you.<br> Captain, I'm afraid<br> I have to ask permission<br> to dismantle your ship<br> to build this machine.<br> Dismantle Carmen?<br> But she's me livelihood,<br> me most loyal companion.<br> Never, never, ever!<br> What if I could direct you<br> to an impeccable physician<br> who could replace both your nipples,<br> at my expense,<br> and I will give you enough money<br> to buy a brand-new ship?<br> You had me at the nipples.<br> - Cornelius, fetch me me tools! Now!<br> - Aye, aye, Captain!<br> One, two! One, two!<br> Timber!<br> I'll go sharpen the propeller.<br> Wrong way. Not looking.<br> Just one more.<br> That's it! Right, lads, tie it off!<br> The Greenwich time zone. The last time<br> I shall set my watch ahead.<br> Well...<br> - Shall we fly?<br> - Let's.<br> Mr. Fogg. Hurrah!<br> Hurrah!<br> Inspiring words.<br> - Very well. Prepare for takeoff!<br> - Yes, sir!<br> - Mr. Fogg, are you sure?<br> - No!<br> Whoa!<br> How the hell are we getting back?<br> Whoa!<br> - Now!<br> - Ohhh!<br> You did it, Phileas! We are flying!<br> My God! It's...<br> magical!<br> - Better than your dreams?<br> - Better than my dreams.<br> Hey! Don't forget to steer!<br> It's a...<br> a telegram from...<br> General Fang, sir.<br> We're going to make it!<br> - This all right?<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - This is exactly like a dream I had.<br> - You dream of winning the race?<br> - No, of crashing to my death.<br> - Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.<br> - Look up there!<br> - Great Scott!<br> Look! A flying machine!<br> - Don't step on the wing!<br> - It's Phileas Fogg!<br> Sir, rumor has it a flying machine<br> is heading for the Royal Academy,<br> our bank thief at the pedals.<br> Some people will believe anything.<br> A flying machine is<br> heading for the Academy!<br> - The bank thief is pedaling!<br> - See what I mean?<br> Help!<br> Well done, Passepartout!<br> The wing ropes!<br> Just a minor setback.<br> Another minor setback.<br> All right, this is a major setback.<br> A flying machine is headed<br> for the Royal Academy,<br> and witnesses swear<br> that it's Phileas Fogg.<br> Faster, Passepartout! Faster!<br> - We're losing altitude!<br> - Landing gear?<br> That would have been<br> an excellent idea!<br> The bird men are here!<br> No. I will not lose this wager!<br> He is not to reach the top step.<br> Get the police. Here. Now!<br> I want Fogg arrested the moment<br> his feet touch British soil!<br> Oh!<br> - I'm sorry...<br> - Right in my ear!<br> Passepartout, get back in your seat.<br> We're going to return to the ground!<br> Stop! Kitchner! Hold your ground!<br> Why are they fleeing?<br> Cowards!<br> Hold on!<br> Make it to the top step!<br> - New Zealand. We didn't go there.<br> - Top step.<br> Arrest them!<br> They robbed the Bank of England!<br> No, no!<br> Nonsense! Where is your proof?<br> This is the Royal Academy of Science!<br> We don't need to prove anything!<br> Besides which,<br> by the time you get out of jail,<br> you'll have lost the wager.<br> Noon.<br> We did our best.<br> Out of me way! Move it!<br> I used to be somebody important!<br> Should have thrown him<br> through a higher window.<br> - Get off!<br> - Get rid of this buffoon!<br> That's the thanks I get for going<br> halfway around the world to stop Fogg?<br> He also sent a Chinese warlord<br> to kill Phileas Fogg!<br> That's right. He did!<br> Lies! All of it!<br> - Kitchner!<br> - Yes?<br> - Tell them!<br> - Oh, well, yes, uh...<br> - Well, the thing of it...<br> - You mumbling moron!<br> Salisbury, translate Kitchner's blather.<br> I... Me... I... Yes. Yes!<br> - Rhodes!<br> - The thing of it is,<br> I don't want to make a fuss.<br> You spineless cretins!<br> That man stuck me with quills!<br> Bunches of them!<br> Yes! Lord Kelvin's a bully!<br> It's true! I hate to admit it,<br> but I'm a battered lord.<br> - No!<br> - Oh, boo-hoo!<br> So what if I did<br> try to kill Phileas Fogg?<br> What are you gutless peons<br> going to do about it?<br> I hold all the power!<br> I run everything!<br> So which of you half-wits<br> is going to stop me? You? You? You?<br> - The queen!<br> - The queen?<br> Oh, the queen!<br> That inbred, antiquated old cow!<br> The only way she could stop me<br> is if she sat on me!<br> With her big, fat royal bottom!<br> She's behind me, isn't she?<br> Oh, Your Majesty.<br> I have just apprehended the culprits<br> who robbed the Bank of England.<br> - No, Majesty!<br> - Rubbish!<br> Quiet!<br> I love being able to do that.<br> So, Lord Kelvin,<br> unsportsmanlike conduct,<br> attempted murder,<br> trading my arsenal for Buddhas.<br> How do you know about that?<br> I never said...<br> Admit it. You've been<br> a naughty boy, haven't you?<br> Your Majesty, I assure you,<br> there is an explanation for all of this.<br> What it was, was, was...<br> I was... I... I was simply...<br> simply...<br> Why do they always run?<br> Arrest him.<br> Get out of my way, you fools!<br> Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?<br> I'll kill you!<br> I'll have you for this, Fogg!<br> So, is this Phileas Fogg's<br> miraculous flying invention?<br> Your Majesty, we all invented it.<br> I'm very impressed,<br> and that doesn't happen often.<br> Thank you.<br> But still, we failed<br> to help Phileas win his bet.<br> - I'm sorry, Phileas.<br> - Don't be, my chri.<br> I saw the world.<br> I learnt of new cultures.<br> I flew across an ocean.<br> I wore women's clothing.<br> Oh?<br> Made a friend.<br> Fell in love.<br> - Who cares if I lost a wager?<br> - I do.<br> - I've got 20 quid riding on you.<br> - Your Majesty, it has gone 12 noon.<br> Correct. Which gives you<br> - Could we have miscounted?<br> - No.<br> I moved Mr. Fogg's watch ahead one hour<br> as we passed each time zone.<br> The international date line.<br> We set our watches forward<br> at 20 more time zones, so...<br> here it's still day 79.<br> - So, we've...<br> - We've won!<br> We won, we won...<br> Thank God. Ah!<br> Your Majesty, I...<br> I apologize. Do forgive me.<br> - I quite forgot myself.<br> - Go and win your bet, Mr. Fogg.<br> I shall need a new minister of science.<br> Uh, yes, of course, Your Majesty.<br> - Shall we?<br> - Yeah.<br> Go!<br> - We won, Phileas! We won!<br> - Yes!<br> We won!<br> Oh, well done!<br> Go ahead.<br>
