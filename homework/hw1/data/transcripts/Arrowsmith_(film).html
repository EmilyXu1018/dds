                        Emmy. you better turn down<br> towards Cincinnati.<br> If we could find your uncle.<br> Ned Arrowsmith.<br> I guess he'd take us in.<br> Nobody ain't gonna take us in.<br> We're going West.<br> There's a whole lot of new things<br> I aim to be seeing yet.<br> And that was your grandmother. Martin.<br> Fine stock to come from.<br> Pioneer stock.<br> Stubborn stock.<br> That would make a medical man<br> out of you. if anything will.<br> It would make a real scientist out of you.<br> if you live up to it.<br> - Reading old Gray. eh?<br> - Yes. sir.<br> That's right.<br> Physician's library. Three books...<br> Gray's Aratomy. The Holy Bible.<br> Shakespeare.<br> Study. Martin.<br> Someday you may be a great doctor.<br> Get training.<br> Go to college before you go<br> to medical school.<br> Study chemistry.<br> Latin. physics. biology.<br> Be a fine doctor.<br> - Yeah. well?<br> - My name's Arrowsmith.<br> - Arrowsmith?<br> - Martin Arrowsmith.<br> I'm just starting medical school.<br> and I thought I'd like to take<br> my Bacteriology with you this fall<br> instead of waiting till second year.<br> That is. if you don't mind.<br> Yeah? But I do mind.<br> Well. I'm not going to be just<br> an ordinary doctor.<br> No?<br> No. I want to be a research scientist<br> like you. Dr. Gottlieb.<br> Not as great as you are.<br> of course. but...<br> but I'm not interested<br> in just giving pills to people.<br> I'd rather find a cure for cancer.<br> Yeah. if you can do that.<br> you will be much greater than I.<br> I really mean I want to<br> find out things for myself.<br> I know how little I know.<br> and I'm not afraid of hard work.<br> So now we begin to talk sensibly.<br> M o<br> To be a scientist.<br> that is born in a man.<br> And in very few men.<br> It may be born in you.<br> But first. go and be a medical student.<br> Go learn the names of the diseases.<br> Learn to work in the dissecting school<br> without being sick.<br> Learn to watch the blood flow<br> without fainting.<br> Go and get your M.D. after your name.<br> And then... come back to me.<br> - All right. Doc. up you go.<br> - Fine.<br> - You're new. aren't you. Doc?<br> - I'll say so. I was born yesterday.<br> That's why I come along.<br> These people get kinda excited<br> down here once in a while.<br> Does anyone here speak English?<br> - Tutto. sure.<br> - Where's the patient?<br> Well. congratulations.<br> You're the father of a fine boy.<br> No. no. I'm the uncle.<br> he's the father.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> Viro? Why. certainly.<br> You know. Doctor.<br> he's his first baby.<br> Well. it's my first baby. too.<br> - Nurse. I want to find Ward D.<br> - Do you?<br> - Can you direct me?<br> - I could. yes.<br> - Well. if it isn't interrupting your work...<br> - This isn't my work.<br> Nurses aren't supposed to scrub floors.<br> Superintendent caught me<br> smoking a cigarette.<br> You go back for Ward D.<br> turn right and then left.<br> I've been informed<br> that the first duty of a nurse<br> is to stand<br> when she speaks to a doctor.<br> Gee. I've been getting fresh again.<br> It may interest you to know<br> that I'm Dr. Gottlieb's assistant<br> and that I'm on my way to Ward D to take<br> a strain of a very dangerous microbe.<br> When I've done what I came here to do.<br> I shall report you. What's your name?<br> - What's yours?<br> - Arrowsmith.<br> - You're not reporting me. you know.<br> - Gee. there I go again.<br> Scrubbing floors<br> just makes me rebellious.<br> and being rebellious just naturally<br> makes me fresh. and there you are.<br> My name is Leora Tozer.<br> It's a silly name. isn't it?<br> What's wrong with it?<br> I kinda like it.<br> Thanks.<br> When can you get away for dinner?<br> With you?<br> I've decided to overlook reporting you.<br> How about tonight?<br> - Well...<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't mind.<br> - What time?<br> You will report the patient's temperature<br> to me every hour.<br> I'll look in again at 7:00.<br> At 7:00.<br> - I've talked too much.<br> - You haven't bored me.<br> - I've been pretty technical.<br> - I liked it. Made me feel intelligent.<br> Well. at that. you've got to get used<br> to hearing my ideas.<br> - I'm gonna hear a lot of them?<br> - You're going to marry me.<br> - You don't tell me.<br> - I certainly do.<br> Now. you know.<br> I shouldn't wonder if you're right.<br> Of course. it's a little early in the game<br> to be dead sure.<br> but I shouldn't wonder.<br> Guess you're pretty pig-headed<br> and self-centered. aren't you?<br> But I like you so much.<br> I'd be a fool to pass you up.<br> Have you got a nickel?<br> Certainly.<br> What for?<br> I want soft music.<br> You know. I wasn't being funny.<br> I didn't think you were.<br> M oa ovo<br> M ovo oovo<br> I hope you mean that.<br> Because. I warn you.<br> I'm never going to give you up.<br> I've found you. My life's begun.<br> I have sent for you. Martin. to tell you<br> that I am leaving this place<br> where I teach young doctors<br> to kill their patients.<br> I have been called to<br> the McGurk Institute of New York<br> where I shall do only my own research.<br> McGurk?<br> The McGurk Institute is the greatest<br> scientific plant in the world.<br> I am very happy.<br> - Yes. sir. I should think you would be.<br> - And I am happy for you. too. Martin.<br> I have arranged for you to go with me<br> as my assistant.<br> You will have great opportunity there.<br> You're the greatest man<br> I've ever known. Dr. Gottlieb.<br> I'd black your shoes for you.<br> But I can't go to New York with you.<br> It is many years since my shoes<br> have been black. Martin.<br> Anyway. I was not taking you<br> as a bootblack.<br> Why can't you go with me?<br> I'm going to be married.<br> And a man can't marry<br> on what a lab assistant makes. so...<br> I'll just have to practice medicine<br> after all.<br> Practice?<br> Practice!<br> To give pills to ladies.<br> to hold their hands for them.<br> to make their diets for them.<br> Practice? You?<br> You. who have the stuff<br> that makes scientist in you?<br> I'm sorry. sir. but that's how it is.<br> Oh. well.<br> I am too wise to argue<br> with a man in love.<br> You will be a bad doctor for a while.<br> and then you will find your way back to us.<br> And when you do. Martin.<br> let me know. and...<br> I will make a place for you.<br> Go.<br> Good luck to you.<br> - I wish you happiness.<br> - Thank you. sir.<br> By the laws of God<br> and by the laws of the state.<br> I hereby pronounce you<br> man and wife.<br> Two dollars. please.<br> The lady gets it.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Don't mention it. Next.<br> Well... we're married.<br> - I don't feel any different.<br> - I feel kind of flat.<br> - So. where do we go from here?<br> - You start practicing.<br> How does a doctor start practicing?<br> I've often wondered about that.<br> Well. I thought you might take a train<br> with me to my hometown.<br> - That's Wheatsylvania. South Dakota.<br> - Dakota?<br> We got 366 inhabitants<br> in Wheatsylvania.<br> And not a doctor in the lot.<br> Dakota. yeah!<br> Real man's country.<br> Frontier! Opportunity!<br> You're gonna love South Dakota.<br> Come on. we're on our way!<br> For what we are about to receive. Lord.<br> and for all the many blessings<br> Thou hast bestowed upon our house.<br> may we be truly grateful.<br> Amen.<br> - I always...<br> - Leora.<br> - What is it. Mom?<br> - Look!<br> Oh. that.<br> - That happened day before yesterday.<br> - This is too much.<br> - Do you mean to tell me...<br> - You've broken your old parents' hearts.<br> - Now. Iook. here. l...<br> - Martin. please. let me.<br> I'm sorry. darling. but I've got to<br> make my position clear.<br> Mr. Tozer. I've been living alone<br> and working hard for a long time.<br> I intend to go on working hard.<br> But I'm not gonna live alone any longer.<br> That is. I'm not gonna live<br> without Leora.<br> You couldn't have stopped us<br> getting married.<br> But you would have tried<br> to stop us getting married.<br> And I can't waste time now.<br> You asked me this afternoon if l...<br> if I had any money. and l...<br> If you think for a moment you're going<br> to get one red cent out of this family<br> simply because you've butted in<br> where you weren't invited.<br> I wanna know about it.<br> I certainly wanna know about it.<br> I'm not asking for money.<br> I'm asking for your good will.<br> I'm asking you to help me to start<br> in practicing here. so I can support...<br> Martin may not be asking<br> for any money. but I am.<br> Pa's gonna lend Martin $1.000<br> to start up an office.<br> Martin'll pay him interest on it.<br> That is. if Pa doesn't want to give it to us<br> as a wedding present.<br> - A thousand...<br> - You can afford it. Pa. You know you can.<br> - A thousand...<br> - You sit down.<br> And I don't wanna hear<br> any more talk about it.<br> because Martin's giving up a great career<br> as a research scientist<br> to be a country doctor<br> so he can support a wife.<br> And... and you all ought to just<br> get down on your knees<br> and appreciate him<br> and stop scrapping.<br> Will you give me a cigarette.<br> please. Martin?<br> - Leora!<br> - You ain't learned to smoke cigarettes?<br> Yes. I have. And now you can scream<br> at me for a while and lay off Martin.<br> Hey. Lee. Iook.<br> That ought to bring 'em rolling in.<br> Come inside<br> and see what I've got.<br> What have you got?<br> Wait till you see.<br> - What's that?<br> - It's Pa's old Prince Albert.<br> - What. for me to wear?<br> - Certainly!<br> Come on.<br> Martin. stop. Now. this is serious.<br> You put that on.<br> Come on.<br> - Now. let me see.<br> - In a Ford.<br> Well. you're a doctor. aren't you?<br> I'm a country doctor.<br> You bet you're a country doctor. Martin.<br> You gotta to make the young folks<br> get married when they ought to<br> and stay married<br> when they don't want to.<br> You gotta lecture the big boys<br> on the evils of drink<br> and do your own drinking<br> with the shades down.<br> You gotta see that<br> the backyards are tidy.<br> and the milk's fresh.<br> and the meat's pure.<br> That's what being a country doctor<br> means. Martin.<br> I'm proud to know you.<br> Fellow citizens!<br> Do you realize. fellow citizens.<br> there are 366 human souls in this town.<br> and only one man to keep 'em fit?<br> Yay!<br> Leora. sweet.<br> I didn't know a man could be so happy.<br> - Is it a patient?<br> - I think so.<br> Hello. yes. the doctor speaking.<br> My little girl. Mary. she's got<br> a terrible sore throat.<br> She look bad.<br> Can you come right away?<br> Yeah. I'll be right there.<br> Sore throat.<br> Might be diphtheria.<br> - First patient.<br> - About time.<br> There's always a time when<br> things begin to happen.<br> - Four miles to go.<br> - Four miles to glory.<br> Four miles in eight minutes.<br> Good luck. Martin!<br> Don't cry. Mama.<br> Doctor's here now.<br> She looks pretty bad.<br> We done all we could for her.<br> Last night and tonight<br> we steamed her throat.<br> and we put her in the new bedroom.<br> I think it's croup.<br> A little wider.<br> That's a good girl.<br> A little more. That's it.<br> Croup. huh?<br> It is diphtheria.<br> Diphtheria?<br> What's that. diphtheria?<br> I don't know.<br> You fix her up good. Doc?<br> You should have called a doctor<br> before this.<br> If this were a hospital. I'd operate.<br> Try and... try and get some sleep.<br> I'll let you know<br> if there's any change.<br> No. Doctor.<br> Gottlieb was right.<br> I am a rotten doctor.<br> Don't say that. Martin.<br> You did your best.<br> No. I didn't. though.<br> I should have operated.<br> No matter what.<br> I should have operated.<br> You have followed me tonight<br> through the jungles of Africa.<br> You have seen how David Bruce<br> conquered sleeping sickness there.<br> You have waded with me<br> in the Italian marshes<br> where Grassi identified and doomed<br> the malarial mosquito.<br> I have sung to you tonight the praises<br> of your four American doughboys<br> who sacrificed their lives. volunteered<br> to become human guinea pigs.<br> that mankind might<br> be saved from yellow fever.<br> Here in India. and in China. too.<br> from where comes the bubonic plague.<br> I have seen village after village dying.<br> with no help from no doctor nowhere.<br> except me.<br> I sound like<br> pretty important fellow. huh?<br> Well. I am.<br> Not so far ago the whole population<br> of London was nearly wiped out<br> because a little rat carried the germ<br> of the bubonic plague<br> on a ship from China to England.<br> Now that could happen again.<br> I tell you. we don't want<br> no more old-style soldiers.<br> We want<br> new-style doctor-soldiers.<br> Scientific soldiers. Yeah.<br> That's all.<br> - Thank you. Doctor. very nice.<br> - Thank you. thank you. Yeah.<br> - And you. you have questions to ask?<br> - My name's Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> I thought perhaps if you weren't<br> due someplace.<br> you might care to come out<br> and have a...<br> - A drink?<br> - Something of that description. yes.<br> I just think I would.<br> You know some nice place.<br> cool place. here in Detroit...<br> Where am I tonight?<br> - This is Minneapolis.<br> - Min...<br> Yes. there's a fine beer joint here.<br> With real beer.<br> I buy you a drink.<br> Come on.<br> I was assistant to Max Gottlieb.<br> You know him?<br> Gottlieb! The greatest.<br> The spirit of science.<br> I had once the pleasure<br> to speak to him in New York.<br> But let us not be serious.<br> Let us drink. Let us sing.<br> She's a dark and roving eye<br> And her hair hung down in ringlets<br> She's a nice girl...<br> Yes. I've a new lease on life.<br> No doubt about it. you can see<br> for yourself. I'm a new man.<br> I've been stagnating for two years.<br> I'm not going to stagnate any longer.<br> - Have some coffee.<br> - Thanks.<br> Bacon? Eggs?<br> No. thanks.<br> Have some toast.<br> - You must eat something. you know.<br> - I can't.<br> Lee. sweet.<br> It's all right. Lee. sweet.<br> Good babies always<br> make their mothers a little sick.<br> Poor Martin.<br> - You'll be tied down worse than ever now.<br> - What do you mean. tied down?<br> I don't have to go to Africa<br> to save mankind.<br> Plenty of mankind around here.<br> We'll see the world yet.<br> And we'll take the boy with us.<br> Even if he turns out to be a girl.<br> we'll take him.<br> Martin. going places!<br> In the meantime. you watch me<br> stand this town on its ear.<br> - Doc.<br> - Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's about Johnny.<br> - Johnny?<br> - He wants to get his tooth pulled.<br> Are you Johnny?<br> All right. get around to the front.<br> I guess I can't save mankind<br> till I've saved Johnny.<br> Poor Martin.<br> Come on. Johnny. Stand over here.<br> and let's have a look at that tooth.<br> You boys sit on the sofa.<br> And you better hold that dog.<br> He might think I'm hurting Johnny.<br> I wouldn't hurt him.<br> Only dentists do that.<br> And I'm no dentist.<br> Now open your mouth.<br> Is that the one?<br> Yes. I thought it would be.<br> All right. Johnny.<br> you sit over here.<br> You can shut your mouth.<br> Did you ever stop to consider. Johnny...<br> ...how wonderful nature is?<br> In giving us two chances<br> of growing teeth?<br> We get a practice set first.<br> Just to practice brushing our teeth on.<br> Then we get a real set later.<br> And you know. Johnny. somehow...<br> I don't think you're making the most<br> of your tooth-brushing opportunities.<br> Had coconut pie for supper<br> last night. didn't you?<br> All right.<br> Now. Johnny. I'll tell you<br> what's gonna happen.<br> The pain is gonna leave that tooth<br> and it's gonna come all the way<br> along this... this piece of string<br> and disappear into something<br> I've got here in my hand.<br> Now look out. Johnny. it's coming!<br> There you are.<br> Hey. boys. listen.<br> Here's half a dollar.<br> That's a soda apiece<br> and a dime over for gumdrops.<br> then I can get the rest<br> of your teeth. Come on.<br> - Thank you. Doc.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thanks. Doc.<br> What's the matter. Henry.<br> trouble?<br> Well. my cattle got blackleg<br> out by my farm.<br> - Blackleg?<br> - Yeah. Half my cows is dead already.<br> Blackleg. What do you do for that?<br> - Well. the state "vegeteterian." he come.<br> - The state what?<br> The... the cattle doctor.<br> That's him over there.<br> Oh. yes. the vet.<br> Yeah. he's got a needle thing<br> just like you got.<br> But he don't do no good.<br> The poor cows just die quicker.<br> Come on. let's have a look at it.<br> Come on. Henry. I'll be turning vet<br> on you before you know it.<br> That's a pretty bad swelling.<br> You better milk her<br> before she dies on you.<br> - Hello. Doc.<br> - Howdy. Doc.<br> That's my cow there.<br> I'm sorry. gentlemen. but this corral<br> has been commandeered<br> as a state experimental station.<br> It ain't open to the public.<br> - Are you the state veterinarian?<br> - That's me.<br> Well. I'm Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> - I don't believe I know that name.<br> - Well. I'm only a physician.<br> Well. if you've got any influence<br> with these crazy Swedes around here...<br> they seem to think I'm a miracle man.<br> There's no medicine on earth<br> that's sure-fire.<br> - Novak says you use a serum.<br> - Sure. we use a serum.<br> I like to fool around<br> with a microscope. Doctor.<br> and if you'd let me have<br> a bit of your serum<br> and a blood specimen from<br> one of these sick animals...<br> just for the fun of the thing.<br> Why. sure.<br> You. let me have some of that.<br> - Great things. these serums.<br> - Oh. yes. yes.<br> - What is it?<br> - Research. darling. research.<br> Blackleg. cattle disease.<br> I'm turning vet on you.<br> Saving cows may not be the same thing<br> as saving mankind.<br> but it's a step in the right direction.<br> Here's the blood and here's...<br> - Yes. Martin.<br> - I was right. That serum wasn't any good.<br> Yes. Martin.<br> Now. I'm ready to go.<br> and we'll try mine in the morning.<br> Yes. Martin.<br> I'm gonna take it over to Henry's<br> and shoot all his cattle full.<br> Yes. Martin.<br> You see. I'm gonna try a different...<br> a different strength dose on every cow.<br> And then we can see which gets well<br> quickest and which dies quickest.<br> Yes. Martin.<br> Darling. are you hungry?<br> Darling. are you hungry?<br> Hungry?<br> Yes. by gosh. I'm famished.<br> - I'm not surprised. it's after 10:00.<br> - Well. let's have some dinner.<br> How can I cook dinner when<br> you're using the whole stove<br> to cook your old cow medicine?<br> We can have some sandwiches.<br> We've had nothing<br> but sandwiches for days!<br> What's the matter<br> with sandwiches. dear?<br> Five days. Henry.<br> and not a new case yet.<br> Not a one. Doc.<br> I thought she was a goner.<br> but she looks all right now.<br> By golly. Doc. you should be<br> state's vet in South Dakota.<br> I'm sorry about that pair. Henry.<br> You should have shoot<br> your stuff in them. too.<br> That's where you're wrong.<br> Listen. the ones we gave<br> the serum to are all right.<br> The ones we didn't give it to<br> are dead.<br> Don't you see? You have to try<br> both ways when you're experimenting.<br> That's how you find out<br> which way is best.<br> Well. I ain't kicking. Doc.<br> How much I owe you?<br> Forget it.<br> It was just for the fun.<br> Pretty good fun for me all right. Doc.<br> Thanks.<br> Next time you see Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> tell him for me that I don't stand<br> for this kind of monkey business.<br> and if he can't keep off my cattle.<br> he'd better keep out of my way.<br> I'll run him out of the state.<br> I'll see the governor. see that<br> his license is taken away from him.<br> Hiya. Doc.<br> How are ya. Doc?<br> - I've got some things to show you.<br> - You got nothing to show me.<br> - You know best.<br> - Where you been. Doc?<br> - You're quite a vet. Doc.<br> - Best in town.<br> - I'm back on the bellyaches now. though.<br> - That's where you belong.<br> - How's that?<br> - I say bellyaches is where you belong.<br> I don't want to say anything. Doc. but...<br> I don't quite like the tone in your voice.<br> - It's about time you understood...<br> - What?<br> Suppose you try understanding<br> that I've made a blackleg serum<br> that's better than yours.<br> because mine cures the cows.<br> and yours doesn't.<br> When you get that through your head.<br> drop over and I'll show you how<br> to make more like it.<br> If you think you're gonna discredit me<br> and then hold me up...<br> I'm not holding you up.<br> I'm giving you this.<br> Well. you see this?<br> It's what I'm giving you.<br> If you won't take the serum from me.<br> you'll take it from the government.<br> I've sent my reports and samples<br> in to Washington already.<br> Now. what was that<br> you were going to give me. Doctor?<br> Why. you!<br> - That's all right.<br> - You're all right. Doc.<br> Right on the jaw.<br> - Dr. Arrowsmith!<br> - What is it. Johnny?<br> - They've been looking for you all over.<br> - They? Who?<br> Everybody at your house. Your wife<br> took sick this morning after you left.<br> I'll have to ask you to be quiet. Doctor.<br> I'm Dr. Hesslikn. of Leopolis.<br> They called me<br> when they couldn't locate you.<br> The baby?<br> But you can't blame yourself. Doctor.<br> You couldn't possibly have foreseen it.<br> It would have happened anyway.<br> Well...<br> ...as long as I've still got her.<br> Thank you. Doctor.<br> My darling!<br> Lee. sweet!<br> My darling.<br> There...<br> I'll never forgive myself<br> for leaving you like this.<br> Shh. darling.<br> N o o<br> Now I can't have a baby.<br> I'll have to bring you up.<br> I know.<br> Make a great man that<br> everybody will wonder at.<br> Like... like your... Sondelius.<br> or your Gottlieb. even.<br> Don't feel badly. Martin.<br> Lee. sweet.<br> If we could only...<br> Anyway. now we...<br> Oh. let's get out of this!<br> Now I remember.<br> I got a telegram in my pocket<br> for Doc Arrowsmith<br> from New York City.<br> Well. I...<br> I'm gonna love New York!<br> - Scares me. though.<br> - Yeah. me. too.<br> I guess this is us.<br> - All of that?<br> - No. Only the 25th floor.<br> Way up there?<br> "McGurk Institute only."<br> - Did you say 25th floor. Martin?<br> - 25th. yes.<br> I'm not going up that high yet.<br> - No. sir. I've got to get used to this first.<br> - Right.<br> Going up!<br> Go.<br> I'd like to see Dr. Gottlieb. if I may.<br> Have you an appointment?<br> Well. he's expecting me.<br> I wired him I was coming.<br> My name is Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> It's Dr. Tubbs you want to see.<br> Dr. Tubbs is our director.<br> You may come with me.<br> - Doctor.<br> - Martin. my boy! So...<br> you have come back to me.<br> as I said you would.<br> Glad to be with you again. sir.<br> And you have come back<br> on your own feet.<br> without any help from me.<br> - I am very glad.<br> - Thank you.<br> So this is the big cow doctor<br> from the West.<br> Delighted to welcome you.<br> Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> A most interesting experiment<br> of yours with the cattle disease.<br> Yeah. Martin. this is Dr. Tubbs.<br> our director.<br> And this is Terry Wickett.<br> a fine chemist.<br> You will be able to meet<br> your other colleagues later.<br> But. Dr. Gottlieb...<br> You will leave my prodigal son<br> to me for a moment. eh?<br> Let me conduct him to his laboratory.<br> Do you think I know enough<br> to work here. Dr. Gottlieb?<br> Now. let us be clear. Martin.<br> You will do your own work here<br> and have no one but yourself to satisfy.<br> A man should do fine work with all this.<br> This? This does not make a scientist.<br> His equipment is here.<br> And a man who cannot make<br> his own laboratory<br> out of toothpicks<br> and a piece of string.<br> he should buy his ideas<br> along with his fine equipment.<br> God give me clear eyes<br> and freedom from haste.<br> God give me anger<br> against all pretense.<br> God keep me... looking<br> for my own mistakes.<br> God keep me at it<br> till my results are proven.<br> God...<br> ...give me strength<br> not to trust to God.<br> Winter again.<br> Well. it was bound to come.<br> I mean. it always has come.<br> That's a fine mess of bugs<br> you got here.<br> Shove them in the incubator.<br> and let's go out and catch a drink.<br> Well. I'll put them in the incubator.<br> but. if you don't mind. I'm going home.<br> Martin. for the love of Pete!<br> I'm sorry. Terry.<br> but I don't feel like drinking tonight.<br> - You are in a bad way. So long.<br> - So long. Terry.<br> - Is that you. Martin?<br> - Yup.<br> How did things go today. any better?<br> About as usual.<br> It just scares me to death<br> to see you this way.<br> Well. you won't be<br> scared much longer. Lee.<br> I've made up my mind to chuck it<br> before they fire me.<br> I've been down there two whole years<br> and haven't accomplished a darn thing.<br> I'm no good. I'm worse at science<br> than I was at doctoring.<br> You mustn't say such things.<br> I won't have it.<br> You may be on the verge<br> of a great discovery this very minute.<br> I've got kind of a feeling that you are.<br> No. don't look at me like that.<br> I mean it.<br> And you'll feel much better<br> when you've had your dinner. too.<br> It's a swell dinner. I bought<br> a beautiful fish this afternoon.<br> Fish.<br> I wish you'd get that old lab<br> out of your mind.<br> I'm through with the lab. all right.<br> I'm not hungry. Lee.<br> Neither am I.<br> I think I'll go for a walk.<br> - I'll come along.<br> - In this snow?<br> I love snow. Come on.<br> I'll get your things.<br> We'll hike across the park. Martin.<br> It'll be like<br> the Canadian Northwest tonight.<br> The park's this way!<br> - Why. Lee. sweet!<br> - I thought you'd be coming back here.<br> And you... you tagged along all that way?<br> You poor kid.<br> That's all right. I didn't mind.<br> I'm a brute. You ought<br> to get a new husband.<br> - Come inside. I'll get you a taxi.<br> - I don't want a taxi.<br> - Let me go up with you.<br> - But. my dear. l...<br> - I have to work. It may be late.<br> - I don't care. I won't bother you.<br> I promise not to open my mouth.<br> Only please. don't send me home.<br> It-it's such a scary night...<br> - I'll imagine things.<br> - What things?<br> Things.<br> All right. Come along.<br> Well... what...<br> What is it?<br> It's got me. Something funny.<br> I left these three flasks<br> thick with bugs.<br> And these two<br> are still thick with them.<br> But this one...<br> They've completely disappeared<br> from this one.<br> Nothing ever happened<br> like that before.<br> Is that good luck or bad?<br> I wouldn't know.<br> I don't know. We're just starting on<br> something new. it's...<br> - Then it is bad luck. I'm sorry.<br> - I don't know that it's bad.<br> Might be something...<br> ...better than anything.<br> Quick. Lee. light that...<br> light the burner.<br> Give me that stain.<br> No. the other one.<br> What is it. Martin?<br> I was right. They're dead.<br> Bugs don't commit suicide.<br> What killed them?<br> Does it matter?<br> "Does it matter?"<br> Lee. I'll say it matters.<br> Something in this clear flask<br> killed them.<br> Maybe it was some fool mistake of mine.<br> but I've got to find out what it is.<br> Because it might...<br> it might just happen that...<br> ...that it turns out to be<br> the greatest thing...<br> How?<br> I won't say it. I won't throw my luck.<br> I'm going to work it out.<br> - Tomorrow. Martin.<br> - No. no. tonight.<br> Right now. You go home<br> and get some sleep.<br> What I need... I've got to have<br> some of...<br> some clean flasks.<br> That is enough of chemistry<br> for today. Terry.<br> We go out now. and drink<br> maybe one glass of beer.<br> Maybe one. maybe two. Sounds<br> reasonable. Chief. I'll get Martin.<br> Where's he been keeping himself lately?<br> I haven't seen him since...<br> - For the love of Pete!<br> - Martin. what is it?<br> - Been working.<br> - You look it.<br> All night long. Two nights.<br> a couple of weeks. I don't know. Look.<br> Notes. Wish you'd look at them. Chief.<br> - Think I may have found something.<br> - What?<br> Don't ask me.<br> All I know is it's...<br> it's hell on the bugs.<br> Dissolves them. eats them up.<br> slaughters them. wipes them off the...<br> You're groggy. aren't you?<br> It's all right. Terry. I fancy<br> I must have been all in...<br> when I started.<br> I need sleep.<br> Food.<br> I need a drink.<br> Terry. I need that more than anything.<br> I'll get it for you.<br> Here. Just wrap yourself around this.<br> Two shakes of a lamb's tail.<br> What?<br> You have a big thing here.<br> A great thing.<br> Terry. Iook.<br> N o<br> Now you must find out what it is.<br> How many different kinds of bacteria<br> it will destroy.<br> That way you will find out<br> what it is good for.<br> You will begin working in earnest.<br> I am very glad. Martin.<br> I'm glad you feel that way. sir.<br> Boy! You are shooting high!<br> We're gonna celebrate.<br> I don't care how tired you are.<br> we're gonna celebrate.<br> - I always knew the kid had talent!<br> - Thanks. Terry.<br> - What do you mean by getting up?<br> - I got to go back to work.<br> Look at you!<br> What's wrong with me?<br> I shaved.<br> You promised you'd stay in bed 12 hours.<br> and you haven't been there three.<br> I couldn't sleep those three hours.<br> I'm not gonna have any more of this.<br> do you hear that?<br> I'm not gonna stand by<br> and see you kill yourself.<br> I'll walk out on you. I mean it.<br> You mustn't ever say that.<br> no matter how mad you get.<br> Lee. I love you so.<br> Even if this darned work<br> does tie me up.<br> I know I've been neglecting you.<br> But when this is over.<br> I'll take time off every day.<br> and we'll go to the movies.<br> and we'll have friends in.<br> and I'll send you flowers<br> every morning.<br> Nice big red roses.<br> I'll even learn to play bridge.<br> Stand by. old girl.<br> Have some coffee?<br> You got the nastiest way of treating me.<br> Martin Arrowsmith.<br> As if I wanted flowers every morning.<br> All I want is for you to take care of yourself.<br> You're a rotten husband.<br> But I'd rather have you<br> than all the decent ones in the world.<br> Please. go back to bed!<br> What is it?<br> - Where's my hat?<br> - What's the matter?<br> That cheap publicity hound Tubbs<br> is the matter! Murder's the matter!<br> Make a cheap fake<br> out of me. will he!<br> You wait a minute!<br> You forgot your...<br> - Hello. Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> - How about a picture?<br> - Very good.<br> - Is Mr. Tubbs down yet?<br> Yes. Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> I'll see if he's engaged.<br> - No. I'll see for myself.<br> - Just a minute. Doctor!<br> - Good morning. Martin.<br> - Are you responsible for this?<br> I don't deny the responsibility.<br> I claim it.<br> A slight overstatement<br> to catch the public eye...<br> A slight overstatement.<br> You tell the papers<br> that I can cure all disease<br> when you know I can't even cure<br> whooping cough yet.<br> And you call that<br> "a slight overstatement."<br> - I can understand your surprise.<br> - My surprise?<br> My only surprise is that<br> I don't wring your fat neck.<br> - My husband's a violent man.<br> - I know your husband.<br> And I mean the world to know him<br> and appreciate him as I do.<br> After all. he's still<br> got his name to make.<br> You've done that for me.<br> You've made my name smell<br> from one end of this country to the other<br> as a quack and a faker<br> and a racketeer.<br> Call your reporters in<br> and tell them I'm through with you<br> and your front page publicity<br> and your cheapjack institute.<br> I'd much rather tell them<br> of the paper I've just signed.<br> Yes. Dr. Gottlieb.<br> We are busy at the moment.<br> Busy turning my friend Martin<br> into a megaphone.<br> - That's all right. Chief.<br> - Something has happened.<br> But it's something<br> not altogether bad.<br> Martin is not the discoverer<br> we thought he was.<br> But you don't mean that someone<br> has stolen...<br> Yes. A Frenchman. D'Herelle<br> of the Pasteur Institute of Paris.<br> He has published his report.<br> It is the same thing.<br> You have got into the newspapers<br> too soon. Dr. Tubbs.<br> Of course. there can be no talk<br> of the Head of Department now.<br> No raise of salary. either.<br> Well l... I've got to say something<br> to those reporters.<br> I am sorry. Martin.<br> Come to my office later.<br> I love that man Gottlieb.<br> He might have gloated.<br> Three stowaways<br> in the hold. sir. dead.<br> What is it?<br> Come on. Sondelius.<br> we have a look.<br> Where was your last port of call?<br> Blackwater. St. Hubert Isle.<br> Did you hear anything there<br> about bubonic plague?<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> These three men<br> died of bubonic plague.<br> I tell you. gentlemen.<br> in West India<br> is bubonic plague.<br> Are you certain of this.<br> Dr. Sondelius?<br> I have investigate.<br> If you don't believe me. call up<br> my good friend Captain Gunnersson<br> of the steamer Sverker.<br> He will tell you.<br> He live by the hotel... What the devil's<br> the name of that hotel in Hoboken?<br> My dear Dr. Sondelius.<br> I'm not questioning your authority.<br> but it's difficult to believe<br> that in the West Indies...<br> Nothing is difficult to believe<br> where rats are concerned.<br> I am no novice at rats neither.<br> Dr. Tubbs.<br> I am only novice<br> in scientific institutions<br> where. all day long. scientists<br> sit and look through microscopes<br> and see nothing.<br> But. my dear Dr. Sondelius!<br> - In common justice to a fine institution...<br> - Excuse me. Dr. Tubbs.<br> Yes. Miss Robbins?<br> A cable just came from London.<br> Doctor.<br> It's from the Colonial Office.<br> There. Dr. Sondelius.<br> is your confirmation.<br> I don't need none.<br> I should like the Institute<br> to have a part in this.<br> Miss Robbins. ask Dr. Arrowsmith if he<br> can receive Dr. Sondelius and myself.<br> Yes. Doctor.<br> Well. what does Dr. Arrowsmith...?<br> Only one year ago.<br> one little year. Dr. Tubbs.<br> you were so excited about<br> my friend Arrowsmith's discovery.<br> Oh. yes. to be sure!<br> But that was...<br> Only something that killed bacteria.<br> that is all?<br> Thank you. Dr. Gottlieb!<br> - I wonder...<br> - I think so.<br> Arrowsmith...<br> Don't I know that name?<br> Young fellow? Dark?<br> Mustache?<br> Sure! Didn't I got drunk with him<br> in Montreal?<br> No. no. Indianap...<br> Well. well. Arrowsmith.<br> it is the same.<br> How are you. my friend?<br> So. you are become great!<br> You hold the stuff of salvation<br> in your hands.<br> I'd like to believe that.<br> I can't quite believe it yet. though.<br> Martin is a very careful fellow.<br> Dr. Sondelius.<br> He has only worked<br> one year on this discovery.<br> After five years. he may be confident<br> that he is right.<br> Five years?<br> He cannot wait for five years.<br> In five years. the whole population<br> of the West Indies will be wiped out.<br> The bubonic plague<br> will be raging in New York.<br> I don't know anything<br> about bubonic plague.<br> But I know. I will teach you<br> what I learn in China and in India.<br> Give me blood germs.<br> give me rats.<br> rat fleas. little jumpy fleas.<br> I will teach you what I learned<br> in China and India.<br> I will show you.<br> Then I will go with you.<br> So. you are off<br> to the West Indies tomorrow.<br> That's right. sir.<br> We have called you in. Terry and I.<br> to give you your final instructions.<br> What are they. sir?<br> Can you be trusted. Martin. to conduct<br> an experiment where you are going?<br> What is the experiment?<br> It is agreed that it will be of value to know<br> what this stuff of yours is good for.<br> Why. yes. of course.<br> Well...<br> If you could give injections to. say...<br> only half your patients.<br> and sternly deprive<br> the other half of them...<br> then you would know.<br> I certainly would. yes.<br> That is the experiment. Martin.<br> I've done that sort of thing with cattle.<br> but. good Lord. these are human beings.<br> So. you're just<br> a country doctor. after all.<br> Country doctor be blowed.<br> I've got compassion in me.<br> These people are gonna be dying<br> and begging me for help.<br> It's up to you to stand up<br> and take it on the chin.<br> So many men are kind and neighborly.<br> so few ever add to human knowledge.<br> It's a good deal to ask. just the same.<br> Spare your pity<br> for generations not yet born. Martin.<br> and you may be<br> the man to end all plague.<br> I am an old man. Martin.<br> I have been an honest scientist<br> all my life.<br> I look to you to carry on<br> my work after me.<br> Are you going to fail me?<br> No. sir. no. I am not going to fail you.<br> I...<br> I knew.<br> For the old man's sake.<br> keep your notes complete down there.<br> And keep them in ink.<br> You sound as though<br> you thought I wasn't coming back.<br> Don't be silly.<br> All ashore who's going ashore!<br> I'm not much<br> of a seeing-off committee.<br> but good luck to you down there<br> and take care of yourself.<br> - Take care of Gottlieb.<br> - I will.<br> Good luck to you. Doctor.<br> We will drink your health<br> in good West Indian rum.<br> It's time. Lee.<br> Yes. Martin.<br> We won't say good-bye.<br> - Will you try not to be too lonely?<br> - I will.<br> That's a brave girl.<br> Excuse me. madam. but which cabin<br> does the trunk belong in?<br> - In Dr. Arrowsmith's. of course.<br> - Yes. madam.<br> - Wait. I haven't got a trunk.<br> - Don't confuse him. It's my trunk.<br> - What do you mean. your trunk?<br> - You had to find out sooner or later<br> that I'm going along with you.<br> - Lee. you're not.<br> - Yes. I am. in spite of everything.<br> You'll do no such thing.<br> Hold that gangplank!<br> On board?<br> - What is it. Doctor?<br> - Get her ashore.<br> - Have to step lively. madam.<br> - No. I won't step lively.<br> I told you I wouldn't let you go there<br> without me and I meant it.<br> And you can't put me off. Nobody<br> but the captain can. I've got a ticket.<br> - No. Lee. please!<br> - I love you.<br> - She stays.<br> - Step to the cabin. madam.<br> I shall divide my group into two halves.<br> To one. I shall give<br> injections of our serum.<br> I shall deprive the other half<br> of any injections whatsoever.<br> I shall then watch which half<br> resists the plague more successfully.<br> When I have done that.<br> I shall know what our serum is worth.<br> Good heavens!<br> The man's a lunatic.<br> Order. gentlemen. order. order.<br> I can handle this. Order.<br> Do you mean to say you can't find<br> any other way to test your serum?<br> There is no other way.<br> You call yourself a doctor<br> and want to see half your patients die?<br> No. sir. no. no. The uninjected half<br> will be fully as well taken care of<br> as they are at present.<br> You actually propose<br> using the inhabitants of this island<br> as you use guinea pigs<br> in your laboratories?<br> Well. you put it unpleasantly. Sir Robert.<br> but that is what I do precisely propose.<br> and for precisely<br> the same benefit to mankind.<br> Well. we decline the honor<br> in the name of civilization.<br> Hear. hear!<br> Hear. hear!<br> I think civilization's on my side.<br> Sir Robert.<br> You see only this one epidemic<br> on this island.<br> I have to see whole continents<br> and generations of children yet unborn<br> in China. in India. and even.<br> it seems. in your own West Indies.<br> I have to say to all humanity.<br> "This is the prevention. this is the cure.<br> "You may count on it as you count<br> on quinine for malaria<br> and castor oil for the bellyache."<br> Because that is<br> what humanity wants to hear.<br> Humanity is not going to hear it<br> at our expense.<br> Well said. Sir Robert!<br> N o<br> While you are on this island.<br> you stick to your doctoring.<br> - That is for me to say. not you.<br> - What the devil do you mean?<br> I mean that if you<br> prevent this experiment.<br> my instructions leave me free to withhold<br> my serum until you come to heel.<br> Confound your instructions.<br> But what...<br> what are we going to do. sir Robert?<br> Sir Robert.<br> hadn't we better reconsider?<br> Order. order.<br> This meeting is adjourned.<br> But. Sir Robert. what shall we do?<br> Die like men...<br> before we let these bandits<br> turn us into a shambles.<br> If it weren't for the quarantine.<br> I'd drive them off the island<br> with whips and scorpions.<br> Sir Robert is quite right.<br> I tell you this...<br> - That was a fine fight.<br> - If I hadn't lost it.<br> You didn't mean that.<br> about holding the serum back?<br> I made them think I meant it.<br> Call me inhuman!<br> I'll show them<br> what the word really means!<br> How's that. Gottlieb?<br> Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> My name is Oliver Marchand.<br> Dr. Marchand.<br> I have my M.D. from Howard University.<br> I've been listening<br> to your proposal. Doctor.<br> I need hardly say<br> that it has my complete sympathy.<br> Thank you.<br> May I offer you an alternative?<br> If you care to come along with me.<br> I believe I can provide<br> the opportunity you're after.<br> - Did you hear that. Gustav?<br> - Yeah. I hear.<br> It will be a privilege to assist you.<br> And if you succeed. it will be a privilege<br> for my people to have served the world.<br> How soon will you be starting?<br> If you'll come over to my place...<br> You don't have to tell me.<br> it came off all right.<br> For once you're wrong. Lee.<br> It couldn't have come off worse.<br> That is. until my savior turned up.<br> This is my savior.<br> Dr. Marchand. my wife.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Come in. Doctor.<br> We've got to move fast.<br> no time to lose.<br> I'll put my things in here.<br> Lee. throw some clothes in a knapsack.<br> - You're going away?<br> - You bet I'm going.<br> - With him?<br> - With him. God bless him.<br> He had the nerve to take a chance<br> and let me do my stuff.<br> Yes. he's a man after my own heart.<br> Wait. where are you going?<br> To his district. Island of Carib.<br> Native population. plague raging.<br> Ideal conditions.<br> - Are you going now?<br> - As soon as we get packed.<br> Sondelius is out chasing up<br> his squad of rat catchers.<br> You might put his things in.<br> too. will you?<br> - Excuse me. Doctor.<br> - I'll wait outside.<br> What is it. Lee?<br> Are you planning to leave me behind?<br> Lee. I've got to.<br> I didn't come here to be left behind.<br> I should have choked you<br> before I brought you along here.<br> You did everything but choke me<br> to stop me.<br> But now that I'm here.<br> I'm not going to be left behind.<br> I've come here to look after you.<br> How can I look after you<br> if you leave me behind?<br> - I'll be all right. sweet.<br> - How do I know that?<br> lt... it might get you.<br> And if it did. there's nobody<br> but me could nurse you.<br> And even if it didn't get you.<br> I'd go mad being without you.<br> Can't you see?<br> I haven't got any life beside you.<br> I'm you. and I've got to be with you.<br> You cannot leave me behind.<br> Lee. sweet.<br> Be reasonable.<br> We don't know where we'll be living off.<br> what we'll be getting into.<br> I daren't take you along with me.<br> It's no place for a woman.<br> Darn being a woman!<br> Give me the comfort<br> of knowing you're safe.<br> - All right.<br> - There's a brave girl.<br> N o<br> Now. will you help me<br> with this knapsack?<br> Bella?<br> Will you come in here. Bella?<br> Bella. I want you to pack<br> the doctors' knapsacks for them.<br> I want you to put in their pajamas.<br> the thin ones.<br> and their underwear<br> and their socks.<br> And. Bella. their razor. toothbrushes.<br> and toothpaste.<br> Can I help you. Martin?<br> I'm all right now. Sorry I cracked up.<br> That's a good girl.<br> Now. here we are.<br> Alcohol. serum...<br> hypodermics. notebooks.<br> Yes. they're ready.<br> - Fountain pen.<br> - Fountain pen. Thanks.<br> - How about these? You want these?<br> - No. I don't want those.<br> Have you got any water boiling<br> on the stove?<br> There should be.<br> Stick the whole works in. will you?<br> - I can't leave those around.<br> - What is it?<br> Plague virus.<br> Enough to kill half a dozen armies.<br> Everything's ready. missy.<br> All right.<br> I'm off to glory. Lee.<br> Wish me luck.<br> I can't go outside.<br> Will you kiss me good-bye here?<br> No. no. Lee. Steady. old girl.<br> This is only the first of our big hikes.<br> If I pull this thing off<br> on Marchand's island.<br> I'll be a great man in science.<br> I do love you. Martin.<br> Wait for me. Lee. I won't be long.<br> Here's where we land. Doctor.<br> It's the island of Carib.<br> You can see the jetty<br> right ahead of us.<br> The worst-infected place<br> in the entire colony.<br> You'll have plenty of opportunity here<br> to do what you want.<br> Voodoo.<br> Their voodoo is just about as effective<br> as anything we've been able to do.<br> Yeah. we show them<br> a new kind of voodoo.<br> The only thing to do with this place<br> is to burn it.<br> - If we can only get the authority.<br> - We'll take the authority.<br> General Sondelius is now in command.<br> We'll get these people out of here<br> and find them a clean place.<br> We'll take off our coats and get to work.<br> We'll get in the supplies.<br> - The medical supplies.<br> - And build a hospital.<br> Sure. we'll kill the rats.<br> the bugs. the germs.<br> I'll get these people out of here.<br> Here. here is food.<br> canned food.<br> - Where is the owner?<br> - The owner lives in London.<br> - How about the agent?<br> - The agent. he's dead.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm watchman.<br> Good. you are a fine watchman.<br> Break down the door. Come on.<br> What the devil is the meaning of this?<br> You have empty bunkhouses<br> and beds.<br> We want them right away<br> for emergency hospital.<br> If you think you're going to bring<br> that filthy plague onto this plantation.<br> you can go to blazes!<br> That's just where we are going.<br> We accept your hospitality.<br> Martin. move in.<br> - Come on.<br> - Hurry up.<br> - All right. Gustav.<br> - Yeah. Martin.<br> Don't forget. half to get the injection.<br> half to be sternly deprived.<br> All right. Marchand. let them in.<br> We're off. Gottlieb.<br> All right. two lines here.<br> Right and left.<br> Go on.<br> Go on through.<br> - Don't we get nothing. Doctor?<br> - Not on the right. Keep moving.<br> It's Dr. Arrowsmith's orders.<br> Half to the left. half to right.<br> You ought to be glad to be hurting.<br> I'm sorry. I can't do anything<br> for him. poor baby.<br> You take him.<br> Don't holler before you're hurting.<br> I am clumsy.<br> That's four hypodermics<br> I broke this morning.<br> Get some more<br> from Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> Hot. ja?<br> I think I'll sit down.<br> Just a little.<br> I apologize if I seemed to be<br> unfriendly last night. Doctor.<br> Didn't know what you were up to then.<br> I approve thoroughly.<br> Indeed. it's splendid<br> what you're doing. Doctor.<br> No objections to giving us a shot?<br> We stood in line with the rest.<br> We'll step over to the other line if you like.<br> Doctor. this is my daughter.<br> And this is Mrs. Lanyon.<br> from your New York.<br> Marooned here with the rest of us.<br> That's quite all right if you'll get<br> into line with the rest.<br> I didn't mean to be rude just now.<br> but you took me by surprise.<br> I wish you'd find something<br> I could do to help you.<br> You?<br> Yes. I feel an awful rotter<br> doing nothing.<br> You!<br> Why? Do I strike you<br> as being so hopelessly useless?<br> If I had a twin sister.<br> I think she'd be rather like you.<br> That's how you strike me.<br> That's an original compliment.<br> That's no compliment.<br> it's a scientific fact.<br> Now. would you pass along. please.<br> and let science carry on?<br> All right. Miss Twyford.<br> Dr. Sondelius is sick. sir.<br> Would you come right away?<br> Sondelius sick?<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Here. Marchand!<br> You take over for me. I've got to...<br> Gustav!<br> - What is it. Gustav. what is it?<br> - I don't know. Martin.<br> I'm not feel so good all day.<br> but now l...<br> Good Lord.<br> Maybe the bugs have got me. Martin.<br> You wouldn't take your shot before.<br> but you're gonna take it now.<br> - Quick. bring me one of those trays.<br> - At my age!<br> I was just thinking. Martin.<br> I am nearly 60 years of age.<br> I could lift weights once<br> no sailor could touch.<br> And now... l'm so weak. I...<br> - Bring me a glass of rum.<br> - No. Later.<br> You're going to take this shot now<br> and go back to Blackwater<br> and have Leora nurse you.<br> I. who have quarantined so many.<br> It is my turn now.<br> Why the devil didn't I bring<br> Leora along with me?<br> No chance?<br> Steadily worse. I'm afraid.<br> Thanks. Don't let us keep you.<br> - Rain.<br> - Only a shower. I'll take you home.<br> No. you go. Mr. Twyford.<br> I'll wait. if you don't mind.<br> You'll get soaked.<br> You ever think<br> the jokes God plays?<br> The best one is on the tropics.<br> He made them so beautiful<br> and so rich.<br> And then He give them the plague.<br> All right. I am quite peaceful.<br> Did you ever see Sto...<br> You ever see Stockholm?<br> I would like just once more to see<br> the Strandvagen at dawn.<br> with the young snow falling white.<br> and stagger home through it<br> with one more last good drunk.<br> I feel fine now.<br> I think I'm a little weak.<br> It's a great life.<br> You try to save all these poor devils.<br> Save all of them.<br> Let science experiments go.<br> I never knew before<br> people could hurt me so much.<br> I think I'll sleep... just a little.<br> I'm sorry.<br> He used to troupe all over the country<br> lecturing on heroes of health.<br> Now he's one of them. all right.<br> It was good of you to come.<br> You take it pretty calmly. Doctor.<br> When one of your field officers<br> in the war died in battle.<br> you couldn't stop to mourn for him.<br> You must come home with us.<br> You must let us put you up.<br> Well. thanks. I...<br> I'd love to.<br> But I can't come<br> till Marchand and I have...<br> Let me send down two men<br> to do it for you.<br> I'd rather do it myself. if you don't mind.<br> It's little enough.<br> And then?<br> Why. then. we...<br> we carry on. of course.<br> Lord. Lord<br> Lord. Lord<br> Why hast Thou turned<br> Thy face away. Lord?<br> Lord. save us<br> Lord. preserve us<br> Lord. don't let thy children die<br> Lord. Lord<br> Oh. Lord<br> Arrowsmith. where are you?<br> Well. there you are.<br> Your friend Marchand<br> wants to see you.<br> Hello. Marchand.<br> Nothing wrong down below?<br> I've been called back to Blackwater.<br> I hope your working with me<br> hasn't made trouble for you.<br> The port doctor is down. Seems there's<br> no one but me to call on now.<br> You'll have to go. then.<br> That means I'll have to stay longer<br> than I expected.<br> I had intended putting Marchand<br> in charge of our show. but now...<br> Well. somebody's got to watch things.<br> You're welcome to stay here<br> as long as you care to. Doctor.<br> - Ten days should do it. Doctor.<br> - Ten days.<br> Is there anything I can do for you<br> in Blackwater?<br> You might look in<br> on my wife. Marchand. Tell her...<br> - Tell her not to worry.<br> - Certainly.<br> Hold a while. please.<br> he'll be here in a minute.<br> - It's for you. Arrowsmith.<br> - Thanks.<br> Dr. Arrowsmith?<br> This is Marchand calling<br> from Blackwater.<br> Yes. Marchand. what is it?<br> I can't hear you. Marchand.<br> Are you there. Marchand?<br> Operator. operator. get me<br> the Surgeon General's office back again.<br> Dr. Marchand.<br> Well. you've got to make them answer.<br> Then send somebody over there at once.<br> Dr. Marchand's ill.<br> This is Dr. Arrowsmith at Carib.<br> No. I'm two hours away.<br> Send somebody at once. Anybody.<br> My dear fellow!<br> It's Marchand.<br> It's more than Marchand. it's my wife.<br> I've got to get her over here. I've got to.<br> She'll be alone in that hole now.<br> - Bring her here. of course.<br> - Certainly. bring her here.<br> - How soon can I get her here?<br> - How soon?<br> What if I start now? Have you got<br> a boat of some sort?<br> Yes. I'll get it ready.<br> You have...<br> You have...<br> You have to come home.<br> Help me. Martin.<br> Please.<br> Gone. Missy gone.<br> M goo<br> M goo<br> M goo<br> Lee! Leora. wake up. we're here!<br> She's dead.<br> I thought she'd be safe!<br> But she's dead.<br> We'd better pick her up.<br> No. let me.<br> I'd rather...<br> I loved you. Lee.<br> You knew that. didn't you?<br> Didn't you know<br> I couldn't love anyone else?<br> Didn't you know that. Lee?<br> Give them all the serum.<br> Shoot 'em full of it.<br> Come on. open the doors.<br> let 'em all in!<br> - Open the doors!<br> - Come on!<br> Let them in!<br> Come. come. children.<br> Let them in.<br> Go on. hurry. hurry.<br> Go around.<br> Get all your...<br> Doctor. l... I just...<br> Great job.<br> Thank you in the name of the colony.<br> I'm licked! You never beat me.<br> but I'm licked.<br> Go on. line up. get your shot.<br> Get over there. get your shot.<br> all of you.<br> Go on. line up.<br> Get your shot full of serum.<br> Kill all the rats.<br> Burn all the villages.<br> To hell with the experiment.<br> to hell with science.<br> to hell with Gottlieb!<br> My dear Martin.<br> congratulations.<br> There's never been anything like it.<br> It's stupendous!<br> Letters from the British government.<br> You have ended plague.<br> M oa ca o o<br> In my enthusiasm of the moment.<br> I forgot.<br> My deepest sympathy.<br> Great story. Dr. Arrowsmith.<br> Tell us all about it. Do.<br> Keep on the left.<br> On the left. folks.<br> On the left. folks.<br> You'll have to hurry.<br> my dear fellow.<br> My man will take care<br> of your luggage for you.<br> - Hold it. right there.<br> - Right there. please.<br> That's fine. One more.<br> Hold still. Just a minute. Doctor.<br> Right. We'll get another one.<br> Doctor. Please.<br> - One more. now. Very nice.<br> - Right this way. Doctor.<br> What have you got to tell us?<br> - Hello. Martin.<br> - Hello. Terry.<br> - Sorry. Martin.<br> - Thanks. Terry.<br> - How was it?<br> - Bungled it. Terry.<br> - Afraid you had.<br> - What'll Gottlieb say?<br> You'll find that out.<br> - How is the old man?<br> - Well. I'm afraid he's...<br> Dr. Gottlieb?<br> Are you ready?<br> - What for should I be ready?<br> - For the reception. Doctor.<br> They're bringing him up<br> in the elevator now.<br> He will come to me.<br> He is my son.<br> More than my son.<br> Even if you do make a clown<br> out of him.<br> Out of my laboratory with your...<br> your nonsense.<br> Dr. Mayne. how d'you do?<br> Glad you're here.<br> - Where's Dr. Gottlieb?<br> - We'll send for him.<br> - Will you fetch Dr. Gottlieb. please?<br> - No. please. I'll go to him.<br> Master and pupil. you know.<br> I want to confess.<br> You gave me everything<br> you knew of truth.<br> And when you gave me my chance<br> as well. I betrayed you.<br> I had an excuse. perhaps.<br> but I don't want to go into that.<br> Because whatever I may<br> have accomplished.<br> I did not add to knowledge.<br> I did the humane thing.<br> I lost sight of science.<br> Now. say what you've got to say<br> and throw me out.<br> Dr. Gottlieb!<br> Martin. what's happened?<br> - Dr. Gottlieb.<br> - He's had a stroke.<br> This is most unfortunate.<br> I mean. coming at a time like this.<br> He's gone down into the darkness<br> believing in you. Martin.<br> He never understood a word I said.<br> Not a word.<br> No. no. of course.<br> He couldn't have.<br> But you really must pull yourself<br> together. you know.<br> We've got to get through<br> with this luncheon.<br> in spite of Dr. Gottlieb's<br> regrettable collapse.<br> But before we go in.<br> I want to tell you that from now on.<br> you're department head.<br> with 15.000 a year.<br> I guess that ought to buck you up.<br> How are you. Martin?<br> You didn't expect to see me. did you?<br> I know all you've been through.<br> If my friendship has any meaning<br> for you. will you take that?<br> For all it's worth. Martin.<br> I'm taking him away now.<br> where he can be looked after.<br> But I want to tell you<br> what I'm going to do then.<br> I'm going to clear out of this swell joint<br> with all its swell equipment and publicity.<br> I'm going to build my own lab<br> in the Vermont woods.<br> and I'm going to work.<br> and do nothing but work.<br> And I wouldn't wonder<br> if you'd want to do it with me.<br> because he counted on you<br> to carry on after him.<br> If you want me.<br> you'll know where to find me.<br> We are ready. Martin.<br> Joyce. my dear.<br> Thank you.<br> But will you try and think kindly of me.<br> even if you never see me again?<br> I see. Martin.<br> M a o o a o oa<br> Ready. are you?<br> Well. so am I.<br> It's all right. it's just a few things<br> I want to take along with me.<br> Notes. notes.<br> where are those notes?<br> - But. my dear Martin!<br> - Now. what else? Yes.<br> Why... what in heaven's name<br> are you going to do with...<br> Just an old friend. Did well enough<br> by me before I came.<br> it'll do well enough by me<br> after I'm gone.<br> - Gone?<br> - I can't stay for that luncheon after all.<br> Surely the Institute deserves<br> better of you than this.<br> It certainly does. You know<br> what old Gottlieb used to say?<br> That the man who couldn't make<br> his own lab out of a few toothpicks<br> and a bit of string had better buy<br> his ideas along with his fine equipment.<br> - Martin. what are you thinking of?<br> - The rest of my life. So long. Tubbs.<br> Hey. Terry. hold your horses!<br> Terry. wait! I'm coming with you!<br> Lee and I.<br> we're both coming with you!<br>
