Good luck...<br> I wanted to tell you<br> the other night, but I...<br> Don't worry about it.<br> I have to go. Okay?

Offer to take my coat.<br> You don't have a coat.<br> Well, offer to take my tie.<br> It's a little joke.<br> Take the rest of the week off.<br> You're obviously<br> under a lot of tension.<br> Would you care to wait<br> in the library?<br> Yes!

That's why<br> I had you come over today.<br> This is a tough room.<br> I don't have to tell you that.<br> You must have hated this moose.<br> Why don't you forget<br> the moose for a moment?!<br> Right.<br> You know...<br> ...I didn't inherit money<br> like you did.<br> I started with nothing.<br> And yet...<br> ...I was a millionaire<br> by the time I was 18.<br> Anyone stood in my way,<br> they got hurt.<br> When I was 11 years old...<br> ...I killed a man.<br> When you're 11, you don't even<br> know there's a law against that.<br> Is Susan here?<br> I knew what I was doing.<br> We were poor.<br> He came into our house<br> to steal our food.<br> Well, he was asking for it.<br> I took a knife...<br> ...and I killed him<br> in the kitchen.<br> You probably ate out that night.<br> I mean, with that man<br> lying in your kitchen.<br> - You seem to find humor in everything.<br> - Yes, sorry.<br> - Arthur!<br> - What?<br> Do you know what I consider to be<br> my most precious possession?<br> My daughter.<br> She is my gold.<br> - She is my treasure.<br> - She's very nice.<br> And I protect what's mine.<br> And I do it in an ugly way.<br> - I'm from the gutter.<br> - I understand. The gutter.<br> You seem upset.<br> Now, Susan loves you.<br> And I want you to make her happy.<br> You can count on it.<br> I insist upon you making her happy.<br> Listen.<br> What happens...<br> ...this is just hypothetical...<br> ...if I don't make her happy?<br> Which is out of the question!<br> But let's just say...<br> ...I make her...<br> ...cranky?<br> For cranky, I guess you'd<br> probably just break my ankles.<br> Something like that.<br> You'll make her happy.<br> I don't like your drinking.<br> It makes you unreasonable.<br> I want you to go to work.<br> Now, your father and I<br> talked about it. I want you...<br> ...to work for me.<br> Is this it?<br> She's not happy already?<br> Susan loves you.<br> So I love you.<br> You'll find me a friend.<br> Don't you get it?<br> You can get drunk.<br> You can throw up.<br> You can forget to call me<br> for months.<br> You can't lose with me.<br> I know you too well.<br> And I'm much stronger<br> than you are.<br> I know how alone you are.<br> I hate how alone you are.<br> I've cried because<br> you're so alone.<br> Don't be afraid, Arthur.<br> You're never going<br> to be alone again.<br> Waiter!<br> I'll have another.<br> You want another fish?<br> Don't drink anymore.<br> You're such an asshole!<br> This is what I am!<br> Everyone who drinks<br> is not a poet.<br> Some of us drink<br> because we're not poets.<br> A real woman could<br> stop you from drinking.<br> It'd have to be a real big woman.<br> Will you take my hand?<br> That would leave you with one!<br> Sorry. Here's the hand.<br> I love you, Arthur.<br> Good! I have to talk<br> to the waiter now.<br> My doctor advised me to<br> drink 10 of these an hour.<br> I understand, Mr. Bach.<br> This is the ring my grandfather<br> gave to my grandmother.<br> Then he died.<br> And subsequently,<br> she gave it to me.<br> I'll always love you.<br> It's a great ring, isn't it?<br> It's a beautiful ring.<br> It's a magical night.<br> Do you have any objection<br> to naming a child Vladimir?<br> Even a girl?<br> Ask me.<br> Will you marry me?<br> Take the weekend if you want.<br> Congratulations!<br> Would you mind if I took you home?<br> I've got a terrible headache.<br> I'm sorry.<br> This must be the building.<br> I hope it's not late.<br> Who am I talking to?<br> It's me, it's me.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Oh, shit!<br> I'm sorry to have<br> disturbed you, madam.<br> I was looking for Linda. I hope<br> it's the wrong house. No offense.<br> My husband has a gun!<br> I'm sure he has, madam.<br> For all I know, he shot it<br> while you screamed.<br> Perry! Come over here!<br> This man wants to know<br> where Linda lives!<br> She lives at 14133, Apartment A,<br> next door.<br> You tell a total stranger that?<br> You don't know who he is.<br> - He looks okay.<br> - Right, get over here!<br> She's terrible! Does she<br> always hit you like that?<br> Yeah, what can I do?<br> Mind your business!<br> For God's sake, she's going<br> to kill you! Get in there!<br> Give her a shot!<br> It's you against her, Perry!<br> Oh, God!<br> It's horrible!<br> Horrible!<br> You shouldn't hear this.<br> God!<br> Perry, you're a dead man.<br> Pardon me.<br> Oh, you're a hedge.<br> - You must be Linda's father.<br> - It's kind of late.<br> Although I wasn't sleeping myself.<br> Oh, nice to meet you, Arthur.<br> Hi, Linda!<br> Can I come in?<br> Don't you hate Perry's wife?<br> Let him in.<br> Linda, I've missed...<br> Sorry, Linda.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Really.<br> It happens.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Nobody knocks on a door<br> at 3:00 in the morning!<br> You're so drunk,<br> you can hardly stand up.<br> And you're engaged!<br> This is a goner.<br> I'm going to sleep.<br> You come here at 3 o'clock<br> in the morning to say goodbye?<br> I have to get up and go to work<br> in the morning. Stop kidding around!<br> Will you stop kissing me!<br> I'm sure you're not going<br> to want to be a waitress...<br> ...for the rest of your life.<br> I am studying to be an actress.<br> - You told me.<br> - Well, I am.<br> This is for you...<br> ...your father...<br> ...and your acting career.<br> Please take it and I'll go.<br> $ 100,000.<br> We don't need your money.<br> Linda, it'll help you.<br> Look what it's done for you.<br> Tell your story walking,<br> before I call a cop!<br> Get out of here!<br> Closet.<br> I know.<br> Want to take her for a spin, Hobson?<br> No, thank you, Arthur.<br> Mr. Bach, be sure you call me<br> anytime you need the track.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Thank you.<br> Do you know how miserable I am?<br> You're miserable?<br> I've got all this and I'm on a salary.<br> ARTHUR 3<br> Do you know the worst part?<br> The worst part of being me?<br> I should imagine your breath.<br> Let me be unhappy, will you?<br> You know, Hobson...<br> ...I could love somebody.<br> I never got to love anybody!<br> What do I have to live for?<br> I'm a failure. I'm just in the way.<br> Would you remove your helmet, please?<br> - Why?<br> - Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Now your goggles.<br> - Why?<br> - Please.<br> You spoiled little bastard!<br> You're a man who has everything.<br> But that's not enough.<br> You feel unloved? Welcome to<br> the world. Everyone is unloved!<br> Stop feeling sorry for yourself.<br> And incidentally, I love you.<br> Marry Susan, Arthur.<br> Poor drunks do not find love.<br> Poor drunks have very few teeth.<br> They urinate outdoors.<br> They freeze to death in summer.<br> I can't bear to think<br> of you that way.<br> I need Linda, Hobson.<br> I see.<br> Well, perhaps fate<br> will lend a hand, Arthur.<br> One never knows.<br> Good afternoon?<br> May I come in?<br> If you and your undershirt<br> would walk two paces backwards...<br> ...I could enter this dwelling.<br> How revolting.<br> Look who's here.<br> The British Tonto.<br> How are you? How's Arthur?<br> Ever since I met Arthur,<br> I liked him.<br> We have to make sure these<br> two wonderful kids stay together.<br> Who is this person?<br> - He's my father.<br> - Yes, and I'd like to say that...<br> Try not to speak.<br> Would you get me a cup of tea?<br> I wish to speak to Linda.<br> Sure.<br> There is an engagement<br> party tonight...<br> ...at Arthur's father's house<br> in Southampton.<br> Here is the address.<br> Perhaps you should attend.<br> Are all the ones<br> he passed up coming?<br> Young woman, this is a tie<br> you cannot steal!<br> This is a tie you'll have<br> to work for.<br> Are you inviting me<br> to Arthur's engagement party?<br> This is not an invitation.<br> However...<br> ...if there's one thing that<br> old gentlemen can still do...<br> ...they can still spot<br> young gentlemen in love.<br> Please go to the party.<br> Are you all right?<br> Yes, I'm fine.<br> Does Arthur know you're here?<br> No, Arthur is far too fine<br> a person to be involved...<br> ...in something as devious as this.<br> You really look out for him,<br> don't you?<br> And it is a job<br> that I recommend highly.<br> I have something for you.<br> For me?<br> What is it?<br> If I told you,<br> it would spoil the surprise.<br> Don't open it.<br> Here's your tea.<br> I despise tea.<br> Would you bring me 2 aspirin<br> from the bathroom?<br> You'll find them on the top shelf,<br> behind the untouched shaving cream.<br> That sounds bad.<br> Have you seen a doctor?<br> Yes.<br> And he has seen me.<br> You know...<br> ...I think Arthur has<br> a very good friend.<br> May I kiss you on the cheek?<br> Is it something you feel<br> strongly about?<br> What about your aspirins?<br> The aspirins are for you, my dear.<br> Hello.<br> Good evening.<br> God knows when I'll see you again.<br> Arthur, will you play<br> something for us?<br> - Don't you hate these things?<br> - Despise them.<br> Actually, seriously...<br> ...songs come and go.<br> But I love the classics.<br> And I hope you'll enjoy this one.<br> You'd better watch out<br> You'd better not cry<br> Are you good friends with Arthur?<br> For ages.<br> I'm so pleased he finally found<br> the right woman. Where is she?<br> Over there.<br> Isn't she just beautiful?<br> Of course she is.<br> Why would Arthur marry a dog?<br> Pardon?<br> Santa Claus is coming to town<br> How does it feel to be<br> getting married?<br> Blue Moon<br> You saw me standing alone<br> Without a dream in my heart<br> Thanks a lot. That's flattering.<br> If you knew Susan<br> like I knew Susan<br> I need a drink!<br> - Tell me your entire name, darling.<br> - Preston Langly.<br> Really!

I like a living room<br> you can land a plane in.<br> There's more of it. You like a tour?<br> I've seen bedrooms.<br> Don't be a lover.

Tell them what's happened.<br> The wedding will have to wait.<br> And bring me back some clothes here.<br> Okay, let's open the presents.<br> I'm sorry, Arthur.<br> - For what?<br> - For leaving you.<br> You're not leaving anyone.<br> Why, it's a basketball!<br> What the hell?<br> I knew you didn't have one.<br> If I feel the urge to dribble...<br> ...I can always call the nurse.<br> I'll put this over here.<br> You purchased a choo-choo?<br> Look, the wheels go round.<br> I'm very pleased.<br> Do you remember...<br> ...when you used to play<br> hide-and-seek with me?<br> I used to hide and<br> you never found me!<br> - Did you know I never looked?<br> - Come on!<br> Well, I looked a little.<br> One for you, one for me.<br> Put it on.<br> I don't wish to put it on.<br> I'll put it on.<br> If I begin to die,<br> please take this off my head.<br> This isn't how<br> I wish to be remembered.<br> Aren't they great?<br> I've got guns and<br> holsters too. Look.<br> Just in town for supplies, partner.<br> Arthur, I'm frightened.<br> I know you're frightened.<br> I'm going to take care of you.<br> Good morning, Mr. Bach.<br> Hi, Ken.<br> Here, I'll take that.<br> You look terrible.<br> You haven't slept in a week.<br> Well, we had a bad night.<br> He was up.<br> I got the kippers and eggs.<br> I'll get fired.<br> No, you won't.<br> Listen.<br> For lunch...<br> ...I want the trout almondine<br> from Lutece. Tell Henri it's for me.<br> He shouldn't eat that.<br> I don't want his last meal<br> to be Jell-O.<br> Thanks very much.

Now eat.<br> Come on. You used to make me eat.<br> It's not so bad.<br> You don't need to be<br> so frightened about it.<br> - What?<br> - Dying.<br> Seems natural.<br> Even comforting, now.<br> You're even teaching me<br> how to die?<br> I'm through teaching you anything.<br> You've grown up.<br> You can do anything<br> with your life that you want to.<br> What do you mean?<br> Figure it out.<br> You seen Linda Marolla lately?<br> Linda Marolla?<br> Why would you ask about her?<br> I don't know what I'm talking about.<br> I'm dying.<br> Want me to read you Shakespeare?<br> Hamlet was in big trouble<br> when we left off.<br> No.<br> You're a good son.<br> You take your average kid today.<br> He don't want to go in the army.<br> Yeah, what does he care? Dope!<br> But the Communists,<br> they go in the army!<br> If only we had some Communists here.<br> No.<br> While our kids are dancing...<br> ...their kids are learning<br> how to fight!<br> Everybody's dancing here!<br> You're right.
