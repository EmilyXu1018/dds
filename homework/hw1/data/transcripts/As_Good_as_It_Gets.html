                        I'm just gonna get some flowers, dear.<br> I'll be back in 20 minutes.<br> It's tulip season today.<br> I'm so happy.<br> - Son of the bitch.<br> - Come on, sweetie.<br> Come on, sweetie.<br> Excuse me.<br> Yes, come on.<br> Come on, now.<br> Go for a little ride,<br> then you can whiz all over the city.<br> Go for a ride.<br> Come on. Come on, sweetie.<br> No! Freeze, freeze.<br> Leg down. Leg down. Leg down.<br> Leg down. That's it.<br> That's it. Come on, now.<br> No! You monkey-eared son of...<br> You have pissed your last floor.<br> I bet you wish you were a real...<br> You dog-eared monkey.<br> This is New York.<br> If you can make it here,<br> you can make it anywhere.<br> You ugly, smelly...<br> AS GOOD AS IT GETS<br> Verdell?<br> Verdell?<br> Where's my good doggie?<br> Verdell?<br> Come here, sweetheart.<br> - Mr. Udall?<br> - Yes?<br> - Have you seen Verdell?<br> - What does he look like?<br> My dog, you know...<br> My dog with the little face,<br> little adorable face.<br> Don't you know what my dog looks like?<br> I got it.<br> - You were talking about your dog.<br> - Yeah.<br> I thought it was the name of that colored man<br> that I've been seeing in the halls.<br> Which color was that?<br> Like thick molasses with a broad nose.<br> Perfect for smelling trouble<br> and prison food.<br> Frank!<br> - Yu have got to get dressed.<br> - Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.<br> How are you doing?<br> Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.<br> I think you know that.<br> People are gonna start coming.<br> Please.<br> What I know is as long as you keep<br> your work zipped up around me,<br> I don't give a rat crap what or where<br> you shove you show.<br> Are we done being neighbors for now?<br> - Let me talk to you for a minute.<br> - No, no, no. Not worth it.<br> Definitely not worth it.<br> Verdell must be in the apartment.<br> Okay.<br> Hope you find him.<br> Love that dog.<br> You don't love anything, Mr. Udall.<br> One, two, three, four, five.<br> One, two, three, four, five.<br> Hot! Hot, hot, hot!<br> - Hi, Carl.<br> - Frank.<br> - So, where is he?<br> - He's here, isn't he? He lives here.<br> Take it easy.<br> He just had a little thing with the dog.<br> - It's not such a hot-looking dog.<br> - He's adorable.<br> Where are you going, Frank?<br> Who buys more than me?<br> My honey, where have you been?<br> Look at my boy! Look at him!<br> - I found him, Mr. Bishop.<br> - I know you did. We know you did.<br> Where was my little baby?<br> Where was my baby?<br> In the basement garbage bin,<br> eating diaper shit.<br> - Go ahead, John. You earned your fun.<br> - I'm sorry. It just struck me as funny.<br> Wait.<br> How did he get down in the basement?<br> I mean, even if he got in the elevator...<br> Maybe some nice neighbor shoved him<br> down the garbage chute.<br> "Somewhere in the dark, she confessed,<br> and he had forgiven."<br> "This is what you live for, he said."<br> "Two heads on a pillow,<br> where all is approval."<br> "There is only the safety of<br> being with each other."<br> "How she wondered, could she find such<br> hope in the most shameful part of her?"<br> - Mr. Udall!<br> - "At last, she was able to define love."<br> "Love was..."<br> Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you, please.<br> Let me do this by myself.<br> - "Love was..."<br> - Are you in there?<br> Son of a bitch!<br> bne kl homo!<br> Pansy ass stool pusher!<br> Yes!<br> Maybe this can wait.<br> I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.<br> Well, that's a load off.<br> Did you do something to him?<br> Do you realize that I work at home?<br> No. I wasn't aware.<br> Do you like to be interrupted when<br> you're nancing around in your little garden?<br> No, no. I actually will turn the<br> ringer off on my phone.<br> - Sometimes put a piece of cardboard...<br> - I work all the time.<br> So never, never interrupt me.<br> Okay?<br> Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear<br> the sound of a thud from my home.<br> One week later, there's a smell coming from<br> there that can only be a decaying human body.<br> You have to hold a hankie to your face because<br> the stench that you think you're gonna faint.<br> Even then, don't come knocking.<br> If it's election night, and you're<br> excited and you want to celebrate<br> because some fudge-packer was elected<br> the first queer president of the US<br> and he's going to have you down<br> to Camp David,<br> and you want someone to share<br> the moment with.<br> Even then, don't knock.<br> Not on this door.<br> Not for any reason.<br> Do you get me sweetheart?<br> Yes. It's not a subtle point<br> that you're making.<br> Okay, then.<br> So, the theory of confrontation says now<br> he'll think twice before messing with me.<br> "Love was..."<br> What was love?<br> "Love was..."<br> Now I'm pissed.<br> Now I am really pissed!<br> Don't touch!<br> Don't touch!<br> Shut up!<br> You can intimidate the whole world with<br> your attitude, but you don't intimidate me.<br> I grew up in hell, homeboy.<br> My grandmother had more attitude.<br> Police!<br> Doughnut munching morons!<br> Help me! Help me!<br> Shut up!<br> Assault and battery and you're black!<br> I like Simon! I like him enough<br> to batter you unrecognizable<br> if you verbally abuse him or so much<br> as touch that dog again.<br> Meantime, I'm gonna think of some<br> way that you can make it up to him.<br> I hate doing this!<br> I'm an art dealer.<br> Have a nice day.<br> Party!<br> Excuse me.<br> - Don't touch. Don't touch.<br> - Get a life.<br> - Hey, watch it!<br> - Don't touch!<br> - Look at you. You're all better.<br> - It's that new medication.<br> So you know all my son's stuff, right?<br> No, no, no, no. I got a date tonight.<br> I'm walking out the door.<br> He says to me:<br> "Mom, I promise not to get one of<br> my fevers or coughs during your date."<br> - Isn't that sweet?<br> - Little blonde angel.<br> I said, "you love me the way<br> you love your remote control."<br> "As long as I switch every time you<br> press one of my buttons."<br> - That's great.<br> - I know, yeah.<br> I think people that talk in metaphors<br> ought to shampoo my crotch.<br> - Eat up!<br> - Good.<br> - Stay there. I've got your money.<br> - No, you pay me next week.<br> No, I owe you. I told you today.<br> That's the rule.<br> - Excuse me, Melvin.<br> - Don't...<br> - There you go. You take care.<br> - Thank you.<br> Pardon. Pardon me.<br> Take the money.<br> Debts make me crazy.<br> This way you take a cab home so<br> you have time to get ready for the date.<br> Ready is not my problem.<br> I'm starving.<br> Sit down. You know you're<br> not allowed back here.<br> Spence is more excited by it than I am.<br> He says, "Mom, I promise not to get<br> a fever or cough during your date."<br> Sometimes, this kid,<br> you just wanna...<br> - I've got Jews at my table.<br> - It's not your table.<br> It's the place's table. Behave.<br> This once, you can sit<br> at someone else's station.<br> Or you can wait your turn.<br> How much more you got to eat?<br> Appetites aren't as big<br> as your noses, huh?<br> - What?<br> - That's it. Forget it.<br> - Let me talk to him.<br> - I don't care how long he's been coming.<br> - Let's go.<br> - I'm gonna give him one more chance.<br> - Barred for life.<br> - Here I go! Here I go!<br> - They left.<br> - Yeah, what do you know?<br> Bryan says he doesn't care how<br> long you've been coming.<br> You ever act like this again,<br> you're barred for life.<br> I'm gonna miss the excitement,<br> but I'll handle it.<br> Three eggs over easy.<br> Two sausages, six strips of bacon<br> with fries.<br> - Fries today?<br> - A short stack.<br> Coffee with cream and sweetener.<br> You're gonna die soon with that diet,<br> you know that.<br> We're all gonna die soon.<br> I' will, you will, and it sure<br> sounds like your son will.<br> If you ever mention my son again,<br> you will never be able to eat here again.<br> Do you understand?<br> Give me some sign you understand,<br> or leave now.<br> Do you understand me,<br> you crazy fuck?<br> Do you?<br> Yeah. Yes.<br> I'll get your order.<br> I wan't you wear my earrings tonight.<br> It's just so interesting what you said<br> at dinner. You said it like it was nothing.<br> - Where's the bedroom?<br> - The truth is... This is sort of it.<br> I sort of sleep in here.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> What?<br> I don't know.<br> Grandma! Grandma!<br> Maybe you'd better check.<br> What'd you think I was gonna do?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Mom!<br> I was hearing everything that<br> you were doing, so<br> I put these on to give you privacy.<br> - So how was dinner?<br> - Hi, pal.<br> - How's your friend?<br> - You okay?<br> - Not bad.<br> - You got a temperature?<br> Scootch over.<br> - Where did your friend take you to eat?<br> - Nice place.<br> Carol, I have him.<br> - One more spit.<br> - I said I have him. He's waiting.<br> - Go.<br> - She has me.<br> - Okay, pal. Give me a hug.<br> - Carol.<br> - Give me a big hug.<br> - Carol, I have him.<br> I'm okay, mom.<br> She has me. Go.<br> Close the curtains.<br> No, no, no. You can't smoke.<br> He can't take smoke.<br> Magic.<br> God. Well, that'll teach you.<br> I don't even notice it anymore.<br> All right. Come here.<br> It's all right. You don't have to get that<br> embarrassed. It's a little bit of throw-up.<br> Little bit of throw-up?<br> What should we do?<br> Want me to write down which trains you<br> take to get home, or you wanna lay down<br> No, no. I'll take a cab.<br> Just a little too much reality<br> for a Friday night.<br> I just can't. I promised Simon<br> I'd find him a model.<br> Carl, take me off the speaker. Did I<br> tell you that these are house seats?<br> Come on. You could use a break.<br> Hello? Carl? You there?<br> Okay.<br> I just found a model.<br> Hey, boys!<br> Hey, look! I know this guy.<br> He even brought me dinner.<br> Carl, right?<br> Hey, what's going on?<br> - Hey, hi, remember?<br> - I only need one.<br> You picked me up, maybe a few weeks,<br> I don't know, sometime ago.<br> But this is for a portrait.<br> I need a pretty face.<br> Portrait?<br> Come here. I'll give you the address.<br> It's for tomorrow morning.<br> - Brad Pitt. It's the shit.<br> - Do you read?<br> Who is it, baby?<br> Who is that, Verdell?<br> Who is that?<br> I'm sorry. I told you today.<br> I was out in the studio doing my work,<br> and I just...<br> It's out here.<br> - You sure have great things.<br> - Gershwin. He's great, isn't he?<br> I usually make such a big deal about<br> picking models, but Carl is so thorough.<br> I bet he drove you nuts<br> checking your resume, huh?<br> This is not a nude.<br> Just kidding around.<br> So much for love.<br> And yet another pose.<br> Exactly what is your previous<br> experience?<br> How about that?<br> I'm running out of ideas here.<br> Well, then give me some<br> direction, ok?<br> Nothing. I just watch until<br> something strikes me.<br> I mean, do anything that you think of.<br> Wait for me to say, "hold that pose,"<br> and then just try to comfortably hold it.<br> No direction.<br> Okay.<br> What I do is, I watch.<br> You ever watch somebody who<br> doesn't know that you're watching them.<br> An old woman sitting on a bus,<br> or kids going to school<br> or somebody just waiting. And<br> you see this flash come over them,<br> and you know immediately that it has<br> nothing to do with anything external.<br> Because that hasn't changed.<br> And when you see it, they're just sort<br> of "realer" and they're more alive.<br> I mean, you look at someone long enough,<br> you discover their humanity.<br> No, no. I know exactly<br> what you mean.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Hold it.<br> Hey, look out!<br> Excuse me.<br> So I went in, and I got on<br> the third line of dialogue.<br> And all of a sudden, I blanked.<br> I had no clue as to what the next line was.<br> Clippity-clop, clippity-clop.<br> Ignores me.<br> - So he said to me, ''Last chance.''<br> - Last chance.<br> - So i came back in.<br> - Here she comes to ignore me again.<br> I messed up in the exact same line.<br> I know. But guess what?<br> What?<br> He cast me!<br> Just what the world needs.<br> Another actress.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Can't live without me?<br> I'm finally going to ask. All right.<br> What's with the plastic picnic ware?<br> Why don't you try ours?<br> Are you afraid it isn't clean?<br> I see the help. It's a judgment call.<br> So give yourself a little pep talk:<br> ''Must try other people's clean silverware<br> as part of the fun of dining out.<br> - What's wrong with your son?<br> - What do you care?<br> He's got to fight to breathe.<br> His asthma can just shoot off the charts.<br> He's allergic to dust,<br> and this is New York,<br> so his immune system bails on him<br> whenever there's trouble, so an ear infection<br> - ls this bothering you?<br> - No.<br> An ear infection, whatever, sends us<br> to the emergency room five, six times a month,<br> where I get whatever nine year-old<br> they just made a doctor.<br> Nice chatting with you.<br> - His name?<br> - Spencer.<br> Okay.<br> Spence.<br> Puppy. It's okay.<br> Go on. Go on.<br> You can put on anything you want now.<br> I might be sort of done here.<br> I've been coming here for two weeks,<br> and all we've done is work. Let's play!<br> - So you're practically finished?<br> - Yeah. There is one more stage.<br> Where are you going?<br> No place.<br> I was just gonna sneak a peek.<br> - Verdell, you want some chocolate?<br> - No. He's not allowed.<br> Wait! I gotta take off. Do you<br> wanna say good-bye or anything?<br> Yeah.<br> - He's just got to go. One second.<br> - No, wait.<br> I'm gonna look at the painting,<br> all right?<br> Where are you going, sweetheart?<br> Verdell?<br> Want some water?<br> What is the matter with you? Come on.<br> You want some water?<br> Simon, wait!<br> Why are you doing this?<br> No, no, wait, wait...<br> - That painting in there...<br> - What are you doing, cruising him?<br> Excuse me.<br> - Help me!<br> - We gotta go! Come on!<br> Come on.<br> Okay, so you call 911<br> and don't leave your name?<br> That's right. Yes.<br> - Even a dumb geezer should know...<br> - Just move on. No one was killed.<br> - Is he dead?<br> - Ask him.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Don't bark at me.<br> I didn't name you.<br> We will. And if we can't, we'll come<br> back and ask you again and again.<br> Hey, what are you trying to<br> intimidate me with that attitude?<br> I come from hell.

Just a couple of questions.<br> How hard is that?<br> How do you write women so well?<br> I think of a man.<br> And I take away reason<br> and accountability.<br> - Mom!<br> - In here, Mrs. Connelly.<br> - What?<br> - Hi.<br> - What? Please, just tell me.<br> - I'm Martin...<br> - Please, just tell me!<br> - I'm Martin Bettes. Dr. Bettes.<br> Not your name! What are you telling<br> me your name for? Where is he?<br> He's in the bathroom.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Nothing.<br> Do you know there are doctors<br> come to your house?<br> - No, i didn't.<br> - I'm home.<br> - So what are you doing here?<br> - Well...<br> I didn't know that you had<br> a secret admirer.<br> - What?<br> - You met the gift.<br> He's good.<br> I'm an expert on doctors.<br> Okay, doctor.<br> My wife is<br> Melvin Udall's publisher.<br> She said I was to take excellent<br> care of this little guy<br> because you are urgently needed<br> back at work. That's what she told me.<br> - What kind of work do you do?<br> - I'm a waitress.<br> - In Manhattan.<br> - Dr. Bettes?<br> Yeah. Terry. Excuse me.<br> I'm sorry it took so long.<br> I don't know Brooklyn.<br> I couldn't find it either.<br> Could you get this to the lab?<br> Tell them I need C.B.C. differential,<br> platelets, the whole thing.<br> - And I want it back today.<br> - Okay.<br> I'm sorry. Did you say you're<br> gonna get the results back today?<br> Sure.<br> Let's sit down.<br> These are the receipts,<br> from all the prescriptions<br> from the beginning of the year.<br> - Don't forget the calendar.<br> - Yeah. And this is a calendar of days...<br> and how he felt and what he's been eating.<br> - That's good, that's very good.<br> - How long has he had the problem?<br> - Since forever. Six months old.<br> - Have they done blood tests on him?<br> - Yeah.<br> Only in the emergency room,<br> or when he was well?<br> - Emergency room only.<br> - Okay.<br> - How about skin testing for allergies?<br> - No.<br> No standard scratch test?<br> They poke them with a needle.<br> No, I asked.<br> They said my plan didn't cover it and<br> that it wasn't necessary anyways.<br> - Why? Should I have?<br> - Well.<br> Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's okay. Actually, I think<br> that's their technical name.<br> So, once the tests come back,<br> is there someone in your office<br> we should talk to to get the results, or<br> Me.<br> My home number is on the card.<br> That's his home number.<br> - What?<br> - It's your home...<br> Can we get you anything else?<br> Do you want some water or some coffee?<br> No, thank you.<br> A couple of female slaves?<br> Mrs. Connelly, there's still a lot of<br> tests I need to do...<br> a lot of things I have to find out here.<br> But look, whatever I find out,<br> I promise you at the very least<br> from now on your son is gonna<br> feel a great deal better, okay?<br> Doc!<br> Fine. Okay, okay.<br> That's good.<br> So, you gotta let me know about the<br> additional costs.<br> One way or another we'll...<br> The costs are gonna be<br> considerable, I'm afraid.<br> But don't worry.<br> But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.<br> That's wonderful.<br> Anyway, dear.<br> Thank you for everything, Nora.<br> Forgive my recent crankiness.<br> I'll call when things get back<br> on track, okay?<br> Hijole.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - Who's going to walk Verdell?<br> Oh, no.<br> No!<br> - Is he dead yet?<br> - No.<br> Would there be any way that you would<br> be willing to walk his dog for him?<br> - Absolutely.<br> - You're a wonderful man.<br> Two o'clock would be a good time.<br> Here is the key in case he's asleep.<br> Open his curtains for him<br> so he can see God's beautiful work.<br> And he'll know that even things<br> like this happen for the best.<br> Where did they teach you to talk like this?<br> In some Panama city sailor<br> "wanna hump-hump" bar?<br> Or is this getaway day<br> and your last shot at his whiskey?<br> Sell crazy someplace else.<br> We're all stocked up here.<br> No! No, no!<br> There is a seriously goofy man<br> behind this!<br> You're not allowed to block out that man!<br> Do you really want to go back to emergency<br> where those runt doctors<br> keep telling us that they can't help?<br> This lets a crazy man into our lives.<br> Let's not fight. You know how<br> this will turn out. Come on!<br> You know how this will turn out.<br> This is not like stockings.<br> It's not like a string of pearls.<br> You don't send this one back.<br> Right?<br> No. I do, I understand.<br> Listen. I have to go, okay?<br> FRIENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY<br> No. Okay.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Bye-bye.<br> What a day.<br> Come here, come here.<br> Maybe I'll bring him some food by.<br> Thank you for walking him.<br> - Excuse me, I'm not feeling so well.<br> - This place smells like shit.<br> Go away.<br> - This cleaning lady doesn't...<br> - Please, just leave!<br> What happened to your queer<br> party friends?<br> Get out of here!<br> There's nothing worse than having<br> to feel this way in front of you.<br> Nellie.<br> Your a disgrace to depression.<br> - Rot in hell, Melvin.<br> - No need to stop being a lady.<br> Quit worrying.<br> You'll be back on your knees in no time.<br> Is this fun for you?<br> You lucky devil, it just keeps getting<br> better and better, doesn't it?<br> I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.<br> Frank wants me to beg my parents,<br> who haven't called me, for help.<br> And I won't.<br> And I don't want to paint anymore.<br> So the life that I was trying for is over.<br> The life that I had is gone,<br> and I'm feeling so damn sorry for<br> myself that it's difficult to breathe.<br> It's high times for you, isn't it, Melvin?<br> The gay neighbor is terrified.<br> Terrified!<br> I was just trying to give you a boost.<br> Lucky you.<br> You're here for Rock Bottom.<br> You absolute horror<br> of a human being.<br> The one thing I'll do for you,<br> I might cheer you up.<br> Get out.<br> You wanna know why that dog<br> prefers me? It's not affection.<br> It's a trick.<br> I keep bacon in my pocket.<br> See?<br> My Gosh.<br> We'll both call him. You'll see.<br> It's a trick.<br> Okay?<br> Come here, Verdell.<br> Come here.<br> Come on.<br> - Come here. Come here, baby.<br> - No.<br> It's okay. Come here.<br> Just a stupid dog.<br> Could you leave now?<br> Please?<br> I don't get it.<br> I don't get it.<br> Mr. Udall!<br> - Carol the waitress?<br> - Yes.<br> The doctors gave me your building address.<br> I'm sorry about the hour.<br> If you are...<br> - if you're worried about thanking me...<br> - That's not why I'm here.<br> Though you have no idea<br> what it's like to...<br> have a real conversation<br> with a doctor about Spencer.<br> Note. Put it in a note.<br> - I have a hairdryer.<br> - Why did you do this for me?<br> So you'd come back to work<br> and wait on me.<br> Do you have some idea<br> how strange that sounds?<br> I'm worried you did this be...<br> Are you waiting for me<br> to say something?<br> Look...<br> I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.<br> I don't think this can wait until tomorrow.<br> I need to clear this up now.<br> Clear what up?<br> I'm not going to sleep with you.<br> I will never sleep with you.<br> Never, ever.<br> Not ever!<br> I'm sorry, but...<br> ...we don't open<br> for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.<br> - I'm not kidding.<br> - Anything else?<br> Just... thank you.<br> So you will be at work tomorrow?<br> Yes.<br> ''Never'', she said.<br> ''Never'', she said.<br> I took a chance you were up.<br> I brought you some Chinese soup.<br> Thanks.<br> I've never been this tired<br> in my life.<br> I haven't been sleeping.<br> I haven't been clear in my head<br> or felt like myself.<br> I'm in trouble.<br> It's not just the tiredness.<br> - Boy.<br> - Sick.<br> - Nauseous.<br> - Sleepy.<br> Where everything looks distorted,<br> and everthing inside just kind of aches.<br> And you can barely find the will<br> to complain.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> I'm glad we did this.<br> Good talking to you.<br> You are not still writing that<br> Thank-you note?<br> I'm on the last page.<br> How do you spell "conscience"?<br> C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.<br> Look, I got Sean from the bakery to<br> baby-sit so we could go out.<br> I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer<br> with someone.<br> - Could you spell that again, please?<br> - Spencer's okay.<br> You better start finding something else<br> to do with your free time.<br> - Sean, are you hungry?<br> - Yeah.<br> All right.<br> We got pizza.<br> Carol and I are going out.<br> Sausage, pepperoni. You wanna<br> make this later for you and Spencer?<br> We are going out, like people do.<br> If you can't feel good about<br> this break and step out a little,<br> then i think you ought to have Mr. Udall<br> send you over a psychiatrist.<br> I don't need one, because<br> I know what's really going on here.<br> I gotta finish this letter, or I'll go nuts.<br> This can't be right.<br> "Con-science"?<br> Carol!<br> What?<br> It's very weird not feeling that...<br> ...stupid panic thing inside me<br> all the time.<br> Without that, I just start<br> thinking about myself and...<br> what good<br> does that ever get anybody?<br> Today on the bus<br> there was this adorable couple.<br> And I felt myself...<br> ...giving them a dirty look.<br> I just had no idea everything was...<br> Go ahead.<br> Moving in the wrong direction.<br> Away from a time...<br> when I remembered what it was like<br> to have a man to do anything.<br> Hold fucking.<br> - Sorry.<br> - No, it's okay.<br> Hands with, for christ sake!<br> I felt almost really bad<br> that Dr. Bettes is married.<br> Which is probably why I make poor Spencer<br> hug me more than he wants to.<br> The poor kid doesn't have<br> enough problems.<br> He has to make up for his mom<br> not getting any.<br> - Who needs these thoughts?<br> - So, what are you saying?<br> - That you're frustrated?<br> - Leave me be!<br> Why are you doing this?<br> What is it you want?<br> I hope getting me thinking about<br> everything that's wrong,<br> when all I want to do is not do that,<br> has some purpose.<br> Really, Mom, what is it you want?<br> - What?<br> - I want us to go out.<br> Okay.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Now I gotta send you a thank-you note.<br> Look, Evelyn's here, and her giant Joey.<br> That's why you brought me here?<br> That's really why you brought me here?<br> Well, it's not even mine.<br> This guy Simon seems to have<br> enough on his mind.<br> But the dog did throw up twice last night<br> and his bark is off.<br> - Well, take him to the vet.<br> - I did.<br> They say his stomach's out of whack.<br> - They need him for a couple of days.<br> - Well, do it! What...<br> Sorry.<br> - Excuse me. This is for later.<br> - What's this?<br> - It's a note.<br> - A note?<br> - Yeah, it's a thank-you note.<br> - Thank-you note? No, no, no.<br> - You can read it later.<br> - No, no, thank you.<br> No, thank-you note. No, no.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> She's nice.<br> Evet.<br> - Realy nice, huh?<br> - Really nice.<br> Shouldn't that be a good thing,<br> telling somebody, "no thanks required"?<br> Sure looks like it went over, too.<br> Look at you.<br> You're sure making the rounds.<br> Simon says you brought him soup last night.<br> - What?<br> - Look at you. You think I'm a mark.<br> You helped with the dog.<br> Now, there's other things.<br> Hey, I'm as concerned about<br> Simon as you are.<br> - Concerned?<br> - It's not just financial assistance.<br> He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask<br> his parents for money tomorrow.<br> Well, yeah.<br> I mean, if his parents are alive,<br> they have to help. It's the rules.<br> - Good! That's great.<br> - Absolutely.<br> Let them help him.<br> Only...<br> ...I got a high-maintenance selling painter<br> coming through, so I'm out.<br> - Can you drive him?<br> - Think white and get serious!<br> Take my car? A convertible.<br> - Do you drive?<br> - Like the wind. But I'm not doing it!<br> Getting loud. Getting loud.<br> He wants me to take his car<br> and his client to Baltimore.<br> I want your life for one minute, where<br> my big problem is somebody offers me<br> a free convertible<br> so I can get out of this city.<br> - Go ahead, girl.<br> - Okay. I'll do it.<br> I'll take him. I'll take him.<br> Yeah, get him ready, packed.<br> Tomorrow morning I'll take him. Okay.<br> I'll take him.<br> Fine. Okay.<br> All right.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Let's not drag this out.<br> We don't enjoy one another that much.<br> If there is some mental health foundation<br> that raises money for people like you...<br> please be sure to let me know.<br> - Last-word freak.<br> - Bye-bye.<br> Good luck, lady.<br> - So anything else?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm gonna give my queer neighbor<br> a lift to Baltimore.<br> - Okay.<br> - Hey.<br> What I did for you,<br> It's working out?<br> What you did changed my life.<br> No!<br> No. No thank-you note.<br> Well, part of what I said in this<br> entire history of my life,<br> which you won't read,<br> is that somehow you have done<br> more for my mother, my son<br> and me than anybody else ever has.<br> I'm just going to read you<br> this part of it.<br> "And that makes you the most important,<br> surprising, generous person"<br> "i ever met in my life."<br> "And that you're gonna be in our prayers,<br> our daily prayers, forever."<br> Lovely.<br> I also wrote one part...<br> I'm just gonna say, I wrote, "I'm sorry."<br> I was talking about how I was sorry<br> when I got mad at you for<br> when you came over, and you told my son<br> that he oughta answer back.<br> So i wrote that I was sorry about that.<br> I wrote I was sorry for busting you on that<br> and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night<br> ...when I said I was never...<br> I was sorry. And I'm sorry<br> for every time your food was cold,<br> and that you had to wait<br> two seconds for a coffee filler.<br> I'm sorry for never spotting right there<br> at the table in the restaurant,<br> the human being that had it in him<br> to do this things for us.<br> I'll just, you know what,<br> I'm just gonna start from the beginning.<br> ''I have not been able to express<br> my gratefulness to you.''<br> "Even as I look at the word 'grateful' now,"<br> "it doesn't begin to tell you what I feel."<br> That's nice of you. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Now I want you<br> to do something for me.<br> I'm sorry. Didn't I say ''what''?<br> I thought I said, "what"?<br> - What?<br> - I want you to go on this trip.<br> - No, sir.<br> - I can't do this without you.<br> I'm afraid he might pull<br> the stiff one-eye on me.<br> I need you to chaperone.<br> Separate everything but cars.<br> You said you liked convertibles.<br> Now I'm on the hook.<br> - I'm sorry, "the stiff one-eye"?<br> - Two days.<br> - I can't. I work.<br> - You get off when you want to.<br> - My son.<br> - Bettes said he's doing fine.<br> - Melvin, I'd rather not.<br> - What has that got to do with it?<br> - Funny, I thought it was a strong point.<br> - Write a note. Ain't she sweet.<br> I need a hand, and where'd she go?<br> Are you saying accepting<br> your help obligates me?<br> ls there any other way to see it?<br> No.<br> Here's a little suitcase.<br> Shocked that it's being used.<br> There's no way to pack<br> for this trip.<br> - Alo?<br> - You're still coming, aren't you?<br> Yes.<br> Melvin, I would like to know<br> exactly where we are going.<br> Just south of Baltimore, Maryland.<br> I know what you're gonna say next.<br> I mean, I think I know.<br> I'm not sure, but I think so.<br> There's no need for me to bring<br> anything dressy?<br> I didn't know if we were gonna be eating<br> in any restaurants that have dress codes?<br> Maybe...<br> - Yes. Yes, let's! Let's.<br> - Okay, got you.<br> - What did you think I was gonna ask?<br> - Whether crabs were in season there now.<br> Okay, then. Goodnight.<br> - Anything unusual in the dog's diet?<br> - No.<br> - Everybody gets their own cage?<br> - Certainly.<br> Okay. Put him in with that one, not that one.<br> Builds his confidence, huh?<br> Lip kiss.<br> I love you. I'll miss you.<br> Hey! Real sensitive.<br> - Bye.<br> - Call me when you get settled.<br> - Don't worry, mom. Have good time!<br> - No, don't, don't run.<br> - Have fun! Don't worry!<br> - Don't run. No, no.<br> - No, no. Have fun, but don't run.<br> - Grandma will take care of me! Bye!<br> - Sorry I'm not taking you myself, Simon.<br> - So am I, Frank.<br> Give me a hug.<br> - Everything's gonna be okay, all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Soak it up.<br> It's your last chance<br> for a hug for a few days.<br> Hello.<br> Thank you for being on time.<br> Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.<br> Holy God. Who did that to you?<br> I was attacked.<br> I walked in on some men robbing me.<br> And I was hospitalized.<br> - I almost died.<br> - Let's do the small talk in the car.<br> Let's go.<br> - I was gonna do that for you.<br> - It's all right. Where should we sit?<br> - There's no place cards or anything.<br> - That's all right.<br> You need all the room<br> you can manage.<br> So I'll sit in the back.<br> Never a break. Never.<br> I'm sorry. Thank you for the seat.<br> That was very thoughtful.<br> - You look like you're crowded in there.<br> - It's all right.<br> Thanks.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> I've got the whole trip programmed.<br> I'm just kidding.<br> I wanted to see what you'd do.<br> - No, seriously.<br> - "- TO USE AS ICEBREAKER"<br> We've got good stuff here.<br> I like this music.<br> I like this music.<br> Yes, I'm sure, Simon, they did something<br> really off for you to feel this way,<br> but when it comes to your parents<br> or your kid,<br> something will always be off for you<br> unless you set it straight.<br> And maybe this thing happened to you<br> just to give you a chance to do that.<br> Nonsense, and you want to know why?<br> Anybody here who's interested in what<br> Melvin has to say raise their hand.<br> Do you want to know what happened<br> with my parents?<br> Yes.<br> - When I was a kid...<br> - Wait, wait.<br> I'm gonna pull over,<br> give you my full attention.<br> I always painted,<br> and my mother always encouraged it.<br> I mean, she was really sort of fabulous<br> about it actually.<br> And she used to I was too young to think<br> there was anything wrong with it,<br> and she was, she was very natural.<br> So she used to pose nude for me.<br> And I always thought or I guess<br> I assumed that my father knew about it.<br> - This stuff is pointless.<br> - Hey! Let him finish, please.<br> You like sad stories?<br> You wanna hear mine?<br> Stop!<br> Go ahead, really.<br> Please don't let him stop you.<br> One day he walked in and he found us,<br> and he just, he started screaming.<br> My father didn't come out of<br> his room for 11 years.<br> He used to hit me on the hands<br> with a yardstick<br> if I made a mistake playing the piano.<br> Go ahead, Simon. So you said he came in<br> your room, and he was yelling?<br> Please, come on.<br> He was...<br> Yeah, I know he was...<br> I remember I was defending my mother,<br> I was trying to make peace<br> in the lamest way.<br> I said,<br> ''She's not naked. It's art.''<br> And he started hitting me.<br> He beat me unconscious.<br> And he talked to me less and less<br> after that.<br> He knew what I was before I did.<br> The morning I left for college<br> he walked into my room.<br> He held out his hand.<br> And it was filled with money.<br> A big sweaty wad of money.<br> And he said, ''I don't want you<br> to ever come back.''<br> I just grabbed him<br> and I hugged him.<br> And he turned and walked out.<br> We all have these terrible stories<br> to get over, and you...<br> It's not true.<br> Some of us have great stories,<br> pretty stories,<br> that take place at lakes with boats<br> and friends and noodle salad.<br> Just no one in this car.<br> But a lot of people that's their story.<br> Good times, noodle salad.<br> What makes it so hard is not that<br> you had it bad,<br> but that you're that pissed<br> that so many others had it good.<br> - No! I don't think so.<br> - Not it at all, really.<br> Not it at all?<br> Okay.<br> Let's go to the hotel.<br> Tomorrow you'll see if you can get another<br> big wad of sweaty money out of his hand.<br> Can I ask you a personal question?<br> Sure.<br> You ever get an erection<br> over a woman?<br> Melvin.<br> I mean, wouldn't your life be<br> easier if you weren't...<br> You consider your life easy?<br> All right.<br> I give you that one.<br> Nice packing.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey, Spence.<br> - Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear.<br> - Why are you out of breath?<br> Mom, I ran over a guy and scored a goal.<br> - You did?<br> - Yep. He was big. Charlie, you know!<br> - That's great!<br> - Yep, amazing.<br> - My God, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Mom, we're playing again. Gotta go.<br> - Wait, wait. Just tell me...<br> - He scored a goal.<br> - Mom, I don't believe it.<br> - You would've died.<br> - Yeah.<br> My son was outside playing soccer.<br> Come on, take me out for a good time.<br> Take me out dancing.<br> Dancing?<br> - I can't. I'm exhausted.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> - No. No.<br> - Please, come on. Come on.<br> No.<br> - All right. You're right.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you sad or something?<br> - No, no. I'm nervous.<br> It would be very rough, Carol,<br> if you weren't along.<br> What a nice complient.<br> I'm happy.<br> And you're my date.<br> Let's get dressed.<br> - I'm going to jump in the shower.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'll be right with you.<br> - Okay.<br> All set?<br> Yeah.<br> - Do you sell hard-shell crabs?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do they sell hard-shells?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do they sell hard-shells?<br> - Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Hi.<br> - You have hard-shells, right?<br> - Stop asking everyone.<br> Just him. That's all.<br> Okay, you can answer. We worked it out.<br> Yes, we do.<br> - I can give you a tie and jacket.<br> - What?<br> They require a tie and jacket,<br> but we have some available.<br> Sir.<br> No. I'm not putting that on.<br> In case you were gonna ask,<br> I'm also not going to let you inject<br> me with the plague, either.<br> It's such a nice place.<br> You probably have these dry-cleaned<br> all the time, don't you?<br> Actually, I don't think so.<br> You just wait here.<br> Excuse me. Thank you.<br> Good evening.<br> - I need a coat and tie.<br> - Come on in.<br> No.<br> - No?<br> - That one.<br> That one, yeah. And this tie.<br> Excuse me.<br> She's here.<br> We saved a table for you.<br> Thanks.<br> - Should I get her for you?<br> - No, it's all right. I'll just watch.<br> Madam?<br> Wait!<br> You look so sex...<br> You look great.<br> You look great.<br> You want to dance?<br> I've been thinking about that<br> since you brought it up before.<br> - And?<br> - No.<br> I don't get this place.<br> They make me buy a new outfit<br> and let you in in a housedress.<br> I don't get it.<br> What? Wait. No, wait. What?<br> Where you going? No, why?<br> I didn't mean it that way.<br> I mean, you gotta sit down.<br> You can still give me the dirty look,<br> just sit down and give it to me.<br> Pay me a compliment, Melvin.<br> I need one. Quick.<br> You have no idea how much<br> what you just said hurt my feelings.<br> The mono-minute someone gets that they<br> need you, they threaten to walk out.<br> A compliment is something nice<br> about somebody else.<br> - Now or never.<br> - Okay.<br> And mean it.<br> Can we order first?<br> Okay.<br> Two hard-shell crab dinners!<br> Pitcher ice-cold beer!<br> - Baked or fries?<br> - Fries.<br> - Fries.<br> - One baked, one fried.<br> I'll tell your waiter.<br> Okay. Now...<br> I got a real great compliment for you,<br> and it's true.<br> I'm so afraid you're about to say<br> something awful.<br> Don't be pessimistic.<br> It's not your style.<br> Okay. Here I go.<br> Clearly a mistake.<br> I've got this what... ailment.<br> My doctor, a shrink that<br> I used to go to all the time,<br> he says that in 50 or 60 percent<br> of the cases, a pill really helps.<br> I hate pills.<br> Very dangerous thing pills.<br> Hate. I'm using the word "hate"<br> here about pills. Hate.<br> My compliment is, that night when you came<br> over and told me that you would never...<br> All right, well, you were there.<br> You know what you said.<br> My compliment to you is,<br> the next morning<br> I started taking the pills.<br> I don't quite get how that's<br> a compliment for me.<br> You make me<br> want to be a better man.<br> That's maybe<br> the best compliment of my life.<br> Well, maybe I overshot a little,<br> because I was aiming at just enough<br> to keep you from walking out.<br> How's it going with those pills?<br> Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.<br> It's little by little.<br> It's exhausting talking like this.<br> Exhausting.<br> Do you ever let a romantic moment make<br> you do something you know is stupid?<br> Never.<br> Here's the trouble with never.<br> - You don't owe me that.<br> - That wasn't a payment.<br> When you first came into breakfast,<br> when I first saw you,<br> I thought you were handsome.<br> Then, of course, you spoke.<br> So, now that your soft,<br> little underbelly's all exposed.<br> Tell me,<br> why did you bring me here?<br> Well, I...<br> - That's a personal question.<br> - Tell me, even if you're scared.<br> - Scared?<br> - Tell me why you wanted me here.<br> It's okay.<br> If you ask me, I'll say yes.<br> I...<br> Well...<br> There's a lot of reasons.<br> I thought, maybe if you had sex<br> with Simon, maybe it would...<br> What?<br> - Well, it's just one idea.<br> - That's why you brought me?<br> Like I'm a, what,<br> and I owe you what?<br> I don't know why I brought you.<br> It was just one thought that I had.<br> It came out first. That was<br> all there was to it. I thought...<br> you kiss him, me, when you two<br> seemed to hit it off.<br> No. Wait, wait. That's, I didn't mean.<br> Forget what said about Simon.<br> - I'll never forget you said it.<br> - It's a mistake.<br> It was a mistake.<br> Hello, this is Fred Bishop. And Betty.<br> Sorry to be unable to take your<br> call right now.<br> Please leave a message with all<br> pertinent information.<br> - Say, "good-bye".<br> - Good-bye. - And thank you.<br> It's Simon.<br> I'm in town.<br> Hello?<br> Folks, you haven't been out later<br> than 10:00 in your entire lives.<br> Please pick up the phone.<br> Really.<br> Okay, I'm gonna try you in the morning.<br> I need to see you.<br> Or at least<br> get you to answer the phone.<br> How are you?<br> - ls this going to be your room?<br> - Our room.<br> I don't wanna see him, and he's not<br> gonna come knocking on your door.<br> - What happened?<br> - Don't ask.<br> - Can you not be so violent?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Do you need help?<br> - No!<br> I'm taking a big bath<br> and ordering a big meal.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Are you okay?<br> Don't ask. I'm tired of my own complaints.<br> I gotta get some new thoughts.<br> - Why? What are you thinking about?<br> - How to die, mostly.<br> Can you believe in our little mix<br> you're the "good" roommate?<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Hold it.<br> - I have to draw you.<br> - Ha?<br> - I have to draw you.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Absolutely not. I'm a lot more<br> shy than people think.<br> - I give off the wrong impression...<br> - I have to.<br> - I haven't sketched anything in weeks.<br> - Stop staring. Do a vase.<br> But you're beautiful, Carol.<br> Your skin, your long neck.<br> The back. The line of you.<br> You're why cavemen<br> chiselled on walls.<br> All right.<br> Cut me a break.<br> The next thing I know<br> she's sitting right there next to me.<br> Well, it's not right to go into details.<br> I got nervous.<br> I screwed up.<br> I said the wrong thing.<br> Where if I hadn't,<br> I could be in bed right now<br> with a woman who<br> if you make her laugh you got a life.<br> lnstead, I'm here with you.<br> No offence, but a moron<br> pushing the last legal drug.<br> Jameson, soda back.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't care how you put this.<br> - We're being naughty here, pal.<br> - No, no. This is, this is great.<br> This is so great.<br> I swear to God, my hand won't even<br> keep up. Hold it. Hold it.<br> - I'm just turning.<br> - But then hold that. Hold any of them.<br> - Okay, this?<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> I can't get over my hand's not<br> even bothering me.<br> I can't, I just,<br> I can't get the angle with this cast.<br> Careful.<br> PRIVACY<br> I'm coming in. It's late.<br> Did you have sex with her?<br> Okay, so are you sure you don't<br> want your shampoos or anything?<br> Sorry.<br> I didn't know she was still here.<br> Did you have sex with her?<br> To hell with sex. It was better<br> than sex. We held each other.<br> What I need, he gave me great.<br> I'll get dressed in a hurry.<br> I just love her.<br> How are you doing?<br> - Hello?<br> - Mom, hi.<br> Hello, Simon.<br> You were right.<br> We were home last night.<br> Do you have to whisper?<br> I can barely hear you.<br> - I'm not a screamer. Look, thr reason...<br> - No, no.<br> It was the luckiest thing for all of us<br> you didn't answer last night.<br> - Your father has not been feeling well.<br> - No, I can't hear you!<br> - Hold on.<br> - Hold for what? What do you gotta do?<br> I get why you're angry with me,<br> but it's no...<br> - He's talking to his parents.<br> - Then you listen to me.<br> Truly, no grudges. Okay?<br> Truly.<br> It was a little odd that you didn't come<br> and see me when you heard I was hurt, but<br> - We almost did.<br> - No, I don't even wanna talk about it.<br> The important thing is that<br> your son is happy.<br> - You do sound different.<br> - Yes, I'm working again.<br> - Good. About money...<br> - No, I don't need anything.<br> I'll drop you a line from wherever I land,<br> and then it's up to you to make the<br> next move, and I hope that you do.<br> He's gonna wanna stay. And they'll wanna<br> take a ride to the lake or whatever...<br> - Okay. Bye-bye.<br> - Goodbye, dear.<br> - He's gonna feel stirred up.<br> - By, Mom.<br> We'll probably have a good five-hour drive.<br> It'll give us a chance to relax...<br> - So?<br> - I'm coming with you.<br> - What about your parents?<br> - No, no. I'll take care of it myself.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You've got real problems.<br> I know.

All right.<br> Here's the keys to my apartment.<br> You go up there and wait,<br> and I'm gonna take Carol home,<br> - I'll take a bus.<br> - No, I'll take you.<br> Can you come here?<br> - Look, I don't care what you did for me.<br> - What's wrong?<br> I don't think I wanna know you anymore.<br> All you do is make me feel bad about myself.<br> You have my number.<br> - Let him take you home.<br> - Don't want to.<br> - I love you.<br> - I love you too.<br> Don't say anything.<br> I gotta get a hold of Frank and<br> see where I'm hanging my hat.<br> I think you're going to<br> have to camp it here.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Look.<br> There's Verdell!<br> Come here.<br> Look at you, sweetheart.<br> You feel like your old self again.<br> I know the feeling.<br> Mommy and Daddy are home.<br> Sorry.<br> You're just fun to mess with.<br> They rented your place furnished.<br> Jackie said she was gonna bring<br> your personal things.<br> They were going to set you up<br> in here. It's an extra room.<br> I never use it. It's got good light.<br> No other choice really.<br> I'm coming. I'm coming.<br> It's nice. t's looks good.<br> They've even got your music,<br> paintings, paints.<br> I have to say they did a good job.<br> You know, it's gonna be okay, huh?<br> Cosy, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Thank you, Melvin.<br> You overwhelm me.<br> I love you.<br> I tell you, buddy. I'd be the luckiest<br> guy alive if that did it for me.<br> Make yourself at home.<br> Anything else in the bag?<br> But I was playing soccer<br> while you were away.<br> I know.<br> I love my cookbook.<br> Great.<br> It's got all these wonderful recipes in here.<br> It says something with a shark.<br> I never even fixed shark before.<br> Shark with a bite.<br> - Would you like that, Spencer?<br> - No.<br> There's some cookies here<br> called "Wasps' nests".<br> Where is my big hairy boy?<br> Where is he?<br> Where is my beautiful boy?<br> Sweetheart!<br> - You're in bed.<br> - No, no.<br> Melvin.<br> I just didn't think Verdell should get too<br> comfortable sleeping in here because...<br> Look.<br> The dog's already comfortable.<br> Is this okay?<br> Hello? Hi, it's me.<br> Hi!<br> Yes. He took me in.<br> Yes. It's Carol for you.<br> - Yes. I fainted when I walked...<br> - Just take the dog. Take the dog.<br> - Just take the dog.<br> - Come here.<br> That's right. Take him.<br> Come on. Move fast.<br> - Don't limp. Move fast.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Hello.<br> - Yeah.<br> - How are you doing?<br> - Not so hot.<br> Why? What's wrong?<br> I don't know whether I'm being<br> sensible or hard on you.<br> Maybe both. Maybe.<br> See? Right there I don't know whether<br> you're being cute or crazy now.<br> Cute.<br> You don't have to answer everything I say.<br> Just listen to me, okay?<br> Listen to me.<br> It's really something<br> that you're looking after Simon.<br> And what I said on the street,<br> that was a bad thing to say.<br> It made me sick to my stomach.<br> It was a bad thing to say.<br> And I'd be lying if I didn't say<br> I enjoy your company.<br> But the truth is you do bother<br> me enormously.<br> And I know that think that it's...<br> I think that it's better for me...<br> ...to not have contact with you<br> because you're not ready.<br> And you're pretty old guy to not be ready,<br> and I'm too old to ignore that!<br> But there were extraordinary<br> kindnesses that did take place.<br> So, anyway, thanks for the trip.<br> Good night. Good night.<br> Okay if I say something now?<br> Go ahead.<br> I should've danced with you.<br> Good night.<br> - Are you going to talk to me or not?<br> - I'm coming.<br> - What did she say?<br> - That I'm a great guy.<br> Extraordinary.<br> And she doesn't want<br> contact with me.<br> I'm dying here.<br> - Because... you love her.<br> - No.<br> And you people are supposed to be<br> sensitive and sharp?<br> Then you tell me why!<br> You're the one who's dying here.<br> - I don't know. Let me sleep on it.<br> - Come on.<br> - I'll figure it out.<br> - Please.<br> I'm stuck.<br> I can't get back to my old life.<br> - She's evicted me from my life.<br> - Did you really like it that much?<br> It's better than this.<br> Look, you.<br> I'm very intelligent.<br> If you're gonna give me hope,<br> you gotta do better than you are doing.<br> If you can't be at least mildly interesting,<br> then shut the hell up!<br> I'm drowning here!<br> And you're describing the water.<br> Picking on me won't help.<br> If that's true,<br> I'm really in trouble.<br> Melvin.<br> Do you know where you're lucky?<br> You know who you want.<br> I would take your seat any day.<br> So do something about it! Go over there.<br> Now. Tonight.<br> Don't sleep on it.<br> I mean, it's not always good to<br> let things calm down.<br> You can do this, Melvin.<br> You can do this. You can.<br> Pull the stops. Tell her how you feel.<br> You can do this.<br> - I'm charged.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> She might kill me if I go there.<br> Then get in your jammies<br> and I'll read you a story!<br> Listen, I really think you have a<br> chance here.<br> The best thing you have going for you<br> is your willingness to humiliate yourself.<br> So go over there.<br> Do this. Catch her off guard.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - Okay.<br> Here I go.<br> What's wrong?<br> I forgot to lock the door.<br> - What do you want, Melvin?<br> - I'm sorry I woke you.<br> - Some other time<br> - I wasn't asleep.<br> What a break.<br> Is it a secret<br> what you're doing here?<br> I had to see you.<br> Because?<br> It relaxes me.<br> I'd feel better sitting outside your<br> apartment on the curb...<br> than any other place<br> I can think of or imagine.<br> No, no, wait. That's overstating.<br> I'd rather be sitting inside on the steps,<br> because I don't wanna get my feet<br> in the gutter.<br> - What would that serve?<br> - Stop it!<br> Why can't I just have a normal<br> boyfriend? Why?<br> Just a regular boyfriend<br> who doesn't go nuts on me?<br> Everybody wants that, dear.<br> It doesn't exist.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to interrupt.<br> Boyfriend.<br> Come on in and try<br> not to ruin everything by being you.<br> Maybe we could live<br> without the wisecracks?<br> Maybe we could.<br> It feels a little confined here.<br> Let's take a walk.<br> It's four in the morning.<br> A walk sounds a little screwy to me.<br> - If you don't mind.<br> - Well, if you need an excuse...<br> there's a bakery on the corner<br> we got a good shot it'll be open soon.<br> That way we're not screwy,<br> just two people that like warm rolls.<br> Okay.<br> What are you doing?<br> I still want you to hear part<br> of that car song.<br> You don't have to.<br> And darling<br> I'm never lonely<br> whenever you're in sight...<br> Thank you.<br> You know, I was hope...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Whatever this is, is not gonna work.<br> - I'm feeling...<br> - What?<br> I'm feeling better, Carol.<br> Melvin, even though it may<br> seem that way now,<br> you don't know me all that well.<br> I'm not the answer for you.<br> - I've got a great compliment for you.<br> - You know what?<br> Just let me, let me talk.<br> I might be the only person<br> on the face of the earth<br> that knows you're<br> the greatest woman on earth.<br> I might be the only one who appreciates<br> how amazing you are in every<br> single thing that you do.<br> And how you are with Spencer.<br> Spence.<br> And in every single thought that you have<br> and how you say what you mean<br> and how you almost always<br> mean something<br> that's all about being straight and good.<br> And I think most people miss<br> that about you.<br> And I watch them,<br> wondering how they can watch you bring<br> their food and clear their tables<br> and never get that they just met<br> the greatest woman alive.<br> And the fact that I get it<br> makes me feel good...<br> ...about me.<br> Is that something that's bad for you<br> to be around for you?<br> No.<br> I'm going to grab you.<br> I didn't mean for that to be<br> a question. I'm going to grab you.<br> I know I can do better than that.<br> Better.<br> Definitely better.<br> See?<br> - Want something?<br> - Warm rolls.<br> - Excuse us.<br> - Excuse us.<br>
