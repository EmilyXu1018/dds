                        England<br> - I finished my play.<br> - Well done.<br> Have you seen Mummy?<br> Well, she'll be in the drawing room, I expect.<br> I hope you're not gonna be getting under<br> our feet today, Miss Briony.<br> We got a dinner for 10 to prepare.<br> - Hello, pal, I hear you're putting on a play.<br> - Who told you?<br> Jungle drums.<br> - Will you come and see it?<br> - I'm not sure that would be quite...<br> Why don't you let me read it?<br> You used to make me those beautiful<br> bound copies of all your stories.<br> - I've kept them all.<br> - I still want you to come.<br> - Let's see.<br> - I have to go now.<br> Mummy, I need you!<br> Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.<br> Your first play.<br> Do you think so?<br> Do you think Leon will like it?<br> Well, of course he will.<br> The Trials of Arabella, by Briony Tallis.<br> - BRIONY: Cee.<br> - Yes?<br> What do you think it would feel like<br> to be someone else?<br> CECILIA: Cooler, I should hope.<br> - I'm worried about the play.<br> - I'm sure it's a masterpiece.<br> But we only have the afternoon to rehearse.<br> What if the twins can't act?<br> You have to be nice to them.<br> I wonder how'd you feel if your mother<br> had run off with Mr What's-his-name<br> who reads the news on the wireless?<br> Perhaps I should have written Leon a story.<br> If you write a story, you only have to<br> say the word "castle," and you could see<br> the towers and the woods<br> and the village below, but...<br> In a play, it's...<br> It all depends on other people.<br> - Cee.<br> - Yes?<br> Why don't you talk to Robbie any more?<br> I do.<br> We just move in different circles, that's all.<br> - Do we have to do a play?<br> - Why do we have to?<br> - It's to celebrate my brother Leon's visit.<br> - PIERROT: I hate plays.<br> - JACKSON: So do I.<br> - How can you hate plays?<br> - It's just showing off.<br> - You'll be in this play or you'll get a clout.<br> - And I'll tell the parents.<br> - JACKSON: You're not allowed to clout us.<br> We're guests in this house. And what did<br> the parents say we were to make ourselves?<br> - Well, Pierrot?<br> - Amenable.<br> - Jackson?<br> - Amenable.<br> Amenable, that's right.<br> Now, Briony, what's your play about?<br> Well, it's about how<br> love is all very well,<br> but you have to be sensible.<br> - I suppose you're going to be Arabella.<br> - Well, not necessarily.<br> - In that case, do you mind if I play her?<br> - PIERROT: Lola was in the school play.<br> Do say yes. It'd be the first decent thing<br> to happen to me in months.<br> Well, yes, all right.<br> I suppose we should start by reading it.<br> If you're going to be Arabella, then I'll be<br> the director, thank you very much.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm going to do the prologue.<br> "Prologue.<br> "This is the tale of spontaneous Arabella,<br> "who ran away with an extrinsic fellow.<br> "It grieved her parents to see their firstborn<br> "evanesce from her home<br> to go to Eastbourne."<br> Yes?<br> - Nothing. Just thought I'd watch.<br> - BRIONY: Rehearsals are private, I'm afraid.<br> You can see the play this evening.<br> - I'll have to work then.<br> - Well, I'm sorry, Danny.<br> JACKSON: Can we go for a swim now?<br> PIERROT: Yes, yes, yes!<br> - No, I don't really think there's time!<br> - PIERROT: Cecilia will let us.<br> I'm sure a half-hour break<br> would do us all good.<br> PIERROT: Cecilia? Cecilia!<br> Cecilia!<br> Cecilia! Cecilia, Cecilia.<br> Please, can we go for a swim, Cecilia?<br> Yes, I don't see why not.<br> Don't go out of your depth!<br> Can you do me<br> one of your Bolshevik roll-ups?<br> - CECILIA: Beautiful day.<br> - I suppose so. Too hot for me.<br> - Are you enjoying your book?<br> - No, not really.<br> It gets better.<br> I prefer Fielding any day.<br> Much more passionate.<br> - Leon's coming down today, did you know?<br> - I heard a rumour.<br> He's bringing a friend with him.<br> It's Paul Marshall, the chocolate millionaire.<br> - Are the flowers for him?<br> - Why shouldn't they be?<br> Leon says he's very charming.<br> The Old Man telephoned last night.<br> He says you're planning on being a doctor.<br> - I'm thinking about it, yes.<br> - Another six years of student life.<br> - How else do you become a doctor?<br> - You could get a fellowship, now,<br> - couldn't you? With your First?<br> - I don't want to teach.<br> I said I'd pay your father back.<br> That's not what I meant at all.<br> - Let me help with that.<br> - No, I'm all right, thanks.<br> - Take the flowers. Take the flowers.<br> - I'm all right. I'm all right.<br> Oh, you idiot.<br> Do you realise that's probably<br> the most valuable thing we own?<br> Not any more, it isn't.<br> Careful!<br> I'm...<br> LEON: Hello, Robbie!<br> No need to encourage him.<br> Cee?<br> Mother?<br> - Where is everyone, Danny?<br> - I don't know, sir.<br> DANNY: Sir.<br> LEON: Gasping for a drink.<br> - Will you have one?<br> - PAUL: Rather.<br> - Whisky?<br> - Please.<br> - Leon!<br> - Here she is.<br> CECILIA: Oh, I've missed you.<br> I've been going completely doolally up here.<br> - This is my sister, Cecilia. Paul Marshall.<br> - I've heard an awful lot about you.<br> - Likewise.<br> - LEON: Where are we putting him?<br> In the blue room. Mother's lying down,<br> she's got one of her migraines.<br> I'm not surprised, with this heat.<br> It's the big room next to the nursery.<br> Is the Old Man staying in town?<br> LEON: Looks like it.<br> Some sort of rush on at the Ministry.<br> PIERROT: So aren't we doing the play?<br> LOLA: No.<br> - JACKSON: Why not?<br> - Don't ask me.<br> PIERROT: I don't like it here.<br> PAUL: There's always a problem<br> when a new brand comes about.<br> The remarketing, the re-packaging,<br> the re-shaping.<br> Even the re-flavouring in some cases,<br> or whole new technology.<br> I think our main challenge is whether or not<br> to launch the new Amo Bar.<br> The Army Amo. Do you see? Pass the Amo?<br> (PAUL CHUCKLES)<br> My source at the Ministry is very reliable,<br> I used to clean his shoes at Harrow,<br> informs me we have a good chance<br> of including it<br> in the standard issue ration pack.<br> Which means that I'd have to open<br> at least three more factories.<br> More if they bring in conscription,<br> which I say is bound to happen<br> if Herr Hitler doesn't pipe down.<br> He's about as likely to do that as buy shares<br> in Marks and Spencer's,<br> wouldn't you agree?<br> - This isn't very good.<br> - I make a cocktail with crushed ice,<br> rum and melted dark chocolate.<br> It's absolutely scrumptious.<br> - LEON: Guess who we met on the way in?<br> - Robbie.<br> - I told him to join us tonight.<br> - Oh, Leon, you didn't.<br> So, Robbie, the housekeeper's son,<br> whose father did a bunk 20 years ago,<br> gets a scholarship to the local grammar,<br> the Old Man puts him through Cambridge,<br> goes up at the same time as Cee, and<br> for three years she hardly speaks to him.<br> Wouldn't let him within a mile<br> of her Roedean chums.<br> Anyone got a cigarette?<br> I don't know what the hell he's doing<br> these days, messing about in flower beds.<br> As a matter of fact, he's planning on doing<br> a medical degree.<br> LEON: And the Old Man said yes to that?<br> Look, I really think you should go down<br> to the lodge and ask him not to come.<br> Why? Has something happened<br> between you?<br> For God's sake.<br> - When can we go home?<br> - LOLA: Soon.<br> We can't go home. It's a divorce.<br> - How dare you say that?<br> - Well, it's true!<br> LOLA: You will never, ever use that word<br> again! Do you understand?<br> - Now what are we going to do?<br> - I'm always asking myself that.<br> My name is Paul Marshall.<br> You must be the cousins from the north.<br> - What are your names?<br> - Pierrot.<br> - Jackson.<br> - What marvellous names.<br> JACKSON: Do you know our parents?<br> PAUL: Well, I've read<br> about them in the paper.<br> - What exactly have you read about them?<br> - Oh, you know. The usual sort of nonsense.<br> I'll thank you not to talk about this<br> in front of the children.<br> Your parents<br> are absolutely wonderful people,<br> that's quite clear, and they love you<br> and think about you all the time.<br> Jolly nice slacks.<br> We went to see a show<br> and I got them at Liberty's.<br> - What was the show?<br> - Hamlet.<br> Ah, yes. "To be or not to be."<br> I like your shoes.<br> Duckers in the Turl. They make<br> a wooden thing, shaped like your foot.<br> Keep it forever.<br> PIERROT: I'm starving. When's dinner?<br> Well, I might be able to help you there,<br> if you can guess what I do for a living.<br> - You've got a chocolate factory.<br> - Everyone knows that.<br> Then it wasn't a guess, was it?<br> There'll be one of these in every kit bag<br> of every soldier in the British Army.<br> Sugar casing, so it won't melt.<br> JACKSON: Why should they get free sweets?<br> 'Cause they'll be fighting for their country.<br> Our daddy says<br> there isn't going to be a war.<br> Your daddy is wrong.<br> - Calling it the Army Amo.<br> - Amo, amas, amat.<br> Top marks.<br> It's boring how everything ends in "o."<br> "Polo" and "Aero."<br> - And "Oxo" and "Brillo".<br> - Sounds as if you don't want it.<br> Then I shall just have to give it<br> to your sister.<br> PAUL: Bite it.<br> You have to bite it.<br> BRIONY: The Princess was well aware<br> of his remorseless wickedness.<br> But that made it no easier to overcome<br> the voluminous love she felt<br> in her heart for Sir Romulus.<br> The Princess knew instinctively<br> that the one with red hair<br> was not to be trusted.<br> As his young ward dived again<br> and again to the depths of the lake,<br> in search of the enchanted chalice,<br> Sir Romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache.<br> Sir Romulus rode with his two companions,<br> northwards, drawing ever closer<br> to an effulgent sea.<br> So heroic in manner,<br> he appeared so valiant in word<br> No one could ever guess at the darkness<br> lurking in the black heart<br> of Sir Romulus Turnbull.<br> He was the most dangerous man<br> in the world.<br> "Dear Cecilia, I thought I should write<br> to apologise for my clumsy<br> "and inconsiderate behaviour."<br> "Forgive me if I seem strange but I'm..."<br> ROBBIE: Dear Cecilia, you'd be forgiven<br> for thinking me mad,<br> the way I acted this afternoon.<br> The truth is I feel rather lightheaded<br> and foolish in your presence, Cee,<br> and I don't think I can blame the heat.<br> "Will you forgive me?<br> "Robbie."<br> Off out then?<br> ROBBIE: Yes, Leon's asked me<br> to join them for dinner.<br> So that's why I've been polishing<br> silver all afternoon.<br> I'll think of you when I see my face<br> in the spoon.<br> You're not a bit like your father.<br> Not in any way.<br> That's because I'm all yours. I'll be late.<br> Your shirts are hanging upstairs.<br> - Son.<br> - Yes?<br> Nothing.<br> Briony! Is that you?<br> Are you all right?<br> Do you think you could do me a favour?<br> Could you run ahead<br> and give this to Cee? I...<br> - Feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself.<br> - All right.<br> Briony.<br> Briony!<br> - I suppose he's what you might call eligible.<br> - Rather.<br> He certainly seems to think<br> he's the cat's pyjamas.<br> Which is odd, considering he has pubic hair<br> growing out of his ears.<br> I should imagine he'd give you<br> a lot of very noisy, boneheaded sons.<br> - He's quite a good egg, actually.<br> - You say that about everyone.<br> - Leon!<br> - Rummy, if it ain't my little sis!<br> I wrote you a play, Leon.<br> I wanted to do a play for you.<br> - The Trials Of Arabella.<br> - Well, there's still time.<br> - Doesn't have to be this evening.<br> - No, it's impossible.<br> CECILIA: Briony.<br> LEON: Tell you what. I'm good at voices,<br> you're even better,<br> so we'll read it out after dinner.<br> - Briony, did you read this letter?<br> - Yes, let's. That's a wonderful idea.<br> - Briony!<br> - Here we are. My choc-tail.<br> I insist you try it.<br> Wasn't there an envelope?<br> Do you mind if I come in?<br> LOLA: I've had the most appalling evening.<br> The twins have been torturing me. Look.<br> How awful.<br> Chinese burns.<br> That's right.<br> They want to go home.<br> They think it's me that's keeping them here.<br> Lola.<br> Can I tell you something?<br> Something really terrible.<br> Yes, please.<br> What's the worst word<br> you can possibly imagine?<br> - He's a sex maniac!<br> - That's right.<br> - What's Cecilia going to do?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You ought to call the police.<br> - Do you think so?<br> He said he thought about it all day long.<br> All you have to do is show them the letter.<br> - You won't tell anyone, will you, promise?<br> - I promise.<br> Good. If he found out,<br> there's no knowing what he might do.<br> You're right.<br> You better tidy your face.<br> I've still got to change.<br> Thanks, Briony. You're a real brick.<br> BRIONY: Cecilia!<br> - It was a mistake.<br> - Briony read it.<br> My God, I'm so sorry.<br> It was the wrong version.<br> Yes.<br> - It was never meant to be read.<br> - No.<br> What was in the version<br> I was meant to read?<br> I don't know. It was more formal. Less...<br> - Anatomical?<br> - Yes.<br> It's been there for weeks,<br> and then this morning by the fountain...<br> I've never done anything like that before.<br> And I was so angry with you,<br> and with myself.<br> I thought if you went away to medical<br> school, then I'd be happy, but...<br> I don't know how I could have been<br> so ignorant about myself, so...<br> So stupid.<br> You do know what I'm talking about,<br> don't you?<br> You knew before I did.<br> Why are you crying?<br> Don't you know?<br> Yes, I know exactly.<br> Robbie.<br> Cecilia.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Someone's come in.<br> Cecilia!<br> LEON: People were sitting out<br> having dinner on the pavement.<br> It was always the view of my parents<br> that hot weather encouraged loose morals.<br> In high summer, my sister and I<br> were never allowed out of the house.<br> They thought the villagers would be<br> unnecessarily provoked.<br> What do you say, Cee? Does the hot weather<br> make you behave badly?<br> - Good heavens, you're blushing.<br> - It's just hot in here, that's all.<br> Lola, wipe that lipstick off.<br> You're far too young.<br> What about you, Briony?<br> What sins have you committed today?<br> - I've done nothing wrong.<br> - EMILY: Have you seen the twins recently?<br> They didn't look very happy<br> last time I saw them, poor little chaps.<br> - BRIONY: You know nothing about it.<br> - Briony.

I haven't changed any names,<br> including my own.<br> And was that the problem?<br> No.<br> I had, for a very long time,<br> decided to tell the absolute truth.<br> No rhymes, no embellishments.<br> And I think...<br> You've read the book,<br> you'll understand why.<br> I got first-hand accounts of all the events<br> I didn't personally witness,<br> the conditions in prison,<br> the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.<br> But the effect of all this honesty<br> was rather pitiless.<br> You see, I couldn't any longer imagine<br> what purpose would be served by it.<br> By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?<br> By honesty.<br> Or reality.<br> Because, in fact,<br> I was too much of a coward<br> to go and see my sister in June, 1940.<br> I never made that journey to Balham.<br> ROBBIE: Do you have any idea<br> what it's like in jail?<br> BRIONY: So the scene in which<br> I confess to them is imagined.<br> CECILIA: He sleeps so deeply.<br> BRIONY: Invented.<br> ROBBIE: How old do you have to be to know<br> the difference between right and wrong?<br> BRIONY: And, in fact,<br> could never have happened.<br> Because<br> Robbie Turner died of septicaemia<br> at Bray-Dunes<br> on June the first, 1940,<br> the last day of the evacuation.<br> Cheerio, pal.<br> And I was never able to put things right<br> with my sister, Cecilia,<br> because she was killed<br> on the 15th of October, 1940,<br> by the bomb that destroyed the gas<br> and water mains above Balham tube station.<br> So...<br> My sister and Robbie were never able<br> to have the time together<br> they both so longed for, and deserved.<br> And which, ever since, I've...<br> Ever since I've always felt I prevented.<br> But what sense of hope,<br> or satisfaction, could a reader derive<br> from an ending like that?<br> So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie<br> and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.<br> I'd like to think<br> this isn't weakness or evasion,<br> but a final act of kindness.<br> I gave them their happiness.<br>
