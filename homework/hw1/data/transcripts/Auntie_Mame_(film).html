We're not greenhorns.<br> - That's 95 cents.<br> - Here's a dollar. Keep the change.<br> It's like the ladies' restroom<br> in the Oriental Theater.<br> You're not scared, are you, Norah?<br> Of course not! And don't you be, child.<br> Norah's here to look after you.<br> Saints alive!<br> - You want?<br> - Is this the residence of Mame Dennis?<br> Mame Dennis. Oh, yes!<br> I'm Norah Muldoon.<br> I'm bringing Dennis to his aunt.<br> Oh, you come in. You wait. I fetch.<br> Madam having affair now.<br> Isn't he wonderful?<br> Help is on the way, darlings.<br> That adorable bootlegger is<br> on his way with a gallon of gin.<br> Oh, Allen, darling!<br> Edna, I called you yesterday.<br> - Hello, Mame.<br> - I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - Vladimir, what are you doing here?<br> - Drinking myself to death, of course.<br> Besides, I'm your guest of honor.<br> Of course! You must hear<br> his new symphony, the pastorale.<br> It has real airplane motors<br> and live sheep. It's devastating.<br> You've met our guest of honor,<br> Vladimir Klinkoff? Miss...<br> Mrs. Klinkoff.<br> Yes, of course. Then you've met.<br> Oh, Perry!<br> Doris, now where are you off to?<br> Everyone's going to Clifton's.<br> It's nearly 7.<br> Give Clifton my love.<br> I'll be right over...<br> Oh, dear. The employment bureau didn't<br> tell me you were bringing a child.<br> He looks nice. If he misbehaves,<br> we can toss him in the river.<br> Please let us escape<br> from this den of criminals.<br> Doctor, get this woman<br> on your couch in a hurry!<br> I'm not that kind of a woman.<br> I'm looking for a Miss Mame Dennis.<br> - Ito! lto!<br> - Yes, missy.<br> Show this woman to the kitchen,<br> start her on glasses.<br> - This not dishwashing lady.<br> - Then I must have invited you.

I have an<br> important announcement to make.<br> This is my little boy!<br> He's not really my little boy.<br> He's my late brother's son.<br> My only living relative. That's all we<br> have, just each other, my little love!<br> Well, what am I going<br> to call you, dear?<br> - Pat. Patrick Dennis.<br> - I know the Dennis part.<br> And from now on, you must call me<br> Auntie Mame. Well, well, well, now.<br> Would you like a mar...? No.<br> Is it your bedtime? No, it can't be.<br> The powder room?<br> Food, food! That's it! You must be<br> famished. Come right along with me.<br> Take your shoes off, darling.<br> It's like removing your hat in America.<br> Before sukiyaki,<br> a little hors d'oeuvre.<br> - Could I try some of that jam?<br> - Jam?<br> - That blackberry jam?<br> - Of course.<br> Actually, it's sort of a fishberry jam.<br> It's called caviar.<br> Now, some pickled octopus,<br> raw fish tails...<br> - It's salty, but I like it.<br> - Good. You have wonderful taste.<br> Vera!<br> Vera, this is my little boy.<br> Patrick, I want you to meet a star.<br> A great lady of the theater<br> and my dearest friend, Vera Charles.<br> - Hello!<br> - How do you do?<br> She just loves little boys.<br> - Who's he?<br> - That's a Lithuanian bishop.<br> Doesn't speak a word of English.<br> Stimulating man! Oh, Your Grace.<br> He's a darling and so worldly<br> for a man of God.<br> Everything in the universe is composed<br> of the elements of Aristotle.<br> Thus man is fire, dust and air<br> mingled with water.<br> Acacius, darling,<br> this is my nephew Patrick.<br> This is Mr. Page, dear.<br> That means "Know thyself."<br> Mr. Page is an educator.<br> He runs a school where<br> they do advanced things.<br> You think you might<br> find room for Patrick?<br> For him, yes! In this boy,<br> I see already the fire, dust and air.<br> Add water and stir.<br> Would you want to go there?<br> - Do they wear uniforms?<br> - At my school, we wear nothing.<br> It's heaven! lt'll stimulate<br> his psyche and stir up his libido.<br> - What's libido?<br> - It's perfectly simple. It...<br> I'll tell you what we'll do.<br> Every time you hear a word you don't<br> understand, dear, write it down.<br> Later, I will explain it.<br> - I'm off, Mame.<br> - Lindsay! Lindsay, this is Patrick.<br> Patrick, I want you to meet<br> Lindsay Woolsey, the publisher.<br> - Circulate, darling. Circulate!<br> - New man in your life?<br> Little Patrick!<br> Guess I won't see much of you.<br> We'll go to the zoo,<br> the aquarium, the Philharmonic.<br> We'll be together constantly,<br> the three of us!<br> That's exactly what I had in mind.<br> - Good night, Mame. Thanks.<br> - Watch it, Phyllis.<br> - Some party!<br> - So good of you to come.<br> You played beautifully.<br> I can't thank you enough.<br> Goodbye, Mrs...<br> Of course.<br> There you are, my little love.<br> Come here with your Auntie Mame<br> and sit down a minute.<br> We'll really get to know each other.<br> Well, now, read me all the words<br> you don't understand.<br> "Libido, inferiority complex,<br> stinko, blotto...<br> ...free love, bathtub gin...<br> ...monkey glands, Karl Marx."<br> Is he one of the Marx Brothers?<br> No, dear.<br> She last pretty good tonight.<br> Marie Antoinette room again?<br> Yes. Perhaps she'll wake up<br> without a head.<br> - Get that dog of a dress off her.<br> - Me tuck her in.<br> Is the English lady sick?<br> She's not English.<br> She's from Pittsburgh.<br> - She sounded English.<br> - She has to do something.<br> Now, where were we?<br> "Narcississistic, Lysissistrata...<br> ...cubism, squiffed,<br> neurotic, heterosexual."<br> My, what an eager mind!<br> You won't need these words for months.<br> Your vocabulary needs work.<br> Didn't your father talk to you?<br> - I only saw him at breakfast.<br> - What did he say then?<br> He usually said, "Pipe down, kid.<br> The old man's hung."<br> That's succinct.<br> What did you do in Chicago for fun?<br> Norah took me to the movies<br> every Saturday afternoon.<br> I played Parcheesi with the doorman,<br> until he got fired.<br> Didn't they do anything cultural<br> for you? Well, never mind!<br> Your Auntie Mame will open doors<br> for you.<br> Doors you never even dreamed existed.<br> What times we'll have!<br> Now, what on earth did I do<br> with that will?<br> Now, it's here someplace.<br> Here we are!<br> Now, "Get mahjong lesson, hair done."<br> That can't be it. Yes, it is it!<br> Oh, dear. This is a legal document.<br> A lot of folderol about<br> the Knickerbocker Bank...<br> ...and some Mr. Babcock,<br> your trustee...<br> Oh, I see! I have the responsibility<br> and your trustee has the authority.<br> Norah took me to a movie once<br> about a trustee.<br> There was a prison break.<br> A trustee saved the warden's daughter.<br> This isn't the kind of trustee<br> that lives in a prison. As a rule.<br> We'll tackle him<br> in our own good time.<br> Now, Patrick, is your Auntie Mame<br> anything like you expected?<br> No. The only picture I saw of you was<br> with a shawl and a rose in your teeth.<br> Like a Spanish lady.<br> It's in my suitcase.<br> Didn't your father tell you<br> anything about me before he died?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Well, what was it?<br> Come now, my little love.<br> You must always be frank<br> with your Auntie Mame.<br> Well, my father said, since you're<br> my only living relative...<br> ...I might be living<br> with you someday, and...<br> Well?<br> But that to be left in your hands was<br> a fate he wouldn't wish on a dog.<br> That...<br> What's that?<br> That is a B. The first letter of a<br> Come, child,<br> I'll show you to your room.<br> It's a cozy little nook. My loom is<br> by the window. Do you weave?<br> You can sit at it. I have instructions<br> from a descendant of Pocahontas.<br> I began with an enormous rug.<br> It's that bell pull by the fireplace.<br> Your own little den.<br> How stupid of me.<br> I gave up weaving for sculpture.<br> That is, a sculptor friend<br> used this room for six months.<br> A divine man! Such talented fingers,<br> but what he did to my bust.<br> That's the head, you know.<br> I guess it's not quite ready yet.<br> The Marie Antoinette room! No, Vera's<br> there. You better camp out with me.<br> Shall we try this out for size?<br> - Perfect! Shall we...?<br> - I'll do it.<br> - Sheets. Where were the sheets...?<br> - When will you be home from the party?<br> What makes you think<br> I'm going to any party?<br> Just as I was getting used to<br> all them dragons. What is it?<br> Don't ask me. I didn't paint it.<br> Can I get in her room?<br> At 2:00? You'll be lucky<br> to get in by 5. She's sleeping.<br> - I'll start in the other room.<br> - Can't!<br> She's sleeping in two bedrooms?<br> No. It's the first lady of American<br> theater out cold in the guest room.<br> Again? What does she do, live here?<br> She don't live here. She drinks<br> and does her passing out here.<br> It's a wonder their blood<br> hasn't turned to vinegar.<br> In two weeks,<br> they've had 13 cocktail parties.<br> Only 13 in two weeks?<br> They had to call one off.<br> The bootlegger couldn't come that day.<br> Auntie Mame! Auntie Mame!<br> What is it? What happened?<br> I've got something to show you.<br> Look!<br> Bats!<br> I built it. It has a rubber-band motor.<br> I built the body out of wood.<br> Please, darling,<br> your Auntie Mame is hung.<br> Sure, Auntie Mame.<br> - Sure.<br> - Patrick, Patrick, come back.<br> You know, I really am<br> interested in all your projects.<br> Child, how can you see<br> with all that light?<br> That's better. Be an angel<br> and tell lto to bring me breakfast.<br> Black coffee and a sidecar.<br> And a cold towel for Auntie Vera.<br> - Is she in the guest room again?<br> - Since Sunday. Run along, darling.<br> First, come and give your Auntie Mame<br> a good morning kiss.<br> Gently, darling, gently.<br> That was lovely.<br> I really am fascinated by aviation.<br> I never knew before<br> they did it all with rubber bands.<br> Miss Dennis? Yes, she's here.<br> Who's calling, please?<br> - Mr. Babcock.<br> - Hold the wire.<br> - It's Mr. Babcock, from the bank.<br> - I've been dodging him for days.<br> Well, hello, Mr. Babcock. How nice<br> to hear your voice at long last.<br> I too am looking forward<br> with anticipation to meeting you.<br> The little lad is fine.<br> He can't wait to meet you.<br> Hurry, my tray, darling!<br> Auntie needs fuel.<br> Do drop over anytime, Mr. Babcock.<br> In how many minutes?<br> Yes, 57th Street is right<br> in my neck of the woods.<br> Spitting distance?<br> How vivid. Come right along, then.<br> You can join me for tea.<br> That's right, number 3 Beekman Place.<br> Right away. Vera! Vera!<br> Vera! Vera! I am about to be attacked<br> by the Knickerbocker Bank.<br> - That's lovely.<br> - Vera!<br> Why'd that Oriental sandman<br> let me sleep in my best Chanel?<br> He tried but you bit him.<br> Patrick's trustee,<br> some hideous man...<br> ...is about to descend upon me<br> like a vulture and rob me of my child.<br> He's coming here?<br> In the middle of the night?<br> That moon's bright!<br> Stop being silly. I have got<br> to make the right impression!<br> The Knickerbocker Bank is so<br> conservative, they don't pay interest.<br> All right! Let's get organized.<br> What time is it, and what day is it?<br> I was due at the theater guild.<br> You can't desert me in my predicament.<br> What will I wear?<br> - How can I face the guild?<br> - Will this make me look Scarsdale?<br> - Have you ever been to Scarsdale?<br> - Good afternoon, Aunt Vera.<br> Do Lillian Gish.<br> Simple dress, Madonna-like hairdo.<br> Madonna-like hairdo. That's it.<br> A switch! A switch!<br> - You got one?<br> - Dozens.<br> - Do you throw anything away?<br> - I may go back to one of these colors.<br> - lf you kept your hair natural as l...<br> - I'd be bald! Pick one close to mine.<br> Try this. You need a dress like I wore<br> as Lady... That's stunning!<br> It's my new dress.<br> I haven't had it on yet.<br> I won't put $500 on my back<br> for that awful man. A suit will do.<br> - Hold it so I can braid it like a halo.<br> - I've got to go.<br> I can't let him see you. He'll think<br> I run a house for wanton women.<br> - I'll wear your mink.<br> - Over my dead body!<br> This dress is heaven.<br> You know, green suits me.<br> I think I'll phone up Maggie.<br> Put this on my head. Hurry!<br> No matter how it looks.<br> - I've got to go.<br> - Don't you dare leave me!<br> - You could care less about my career...<br> - Not already! Norah, lto, the door!<br> I've gotta get out before he gets in.<br> I can't leave him down in the foyer!<br> That's the third time!<br> - Be my friend for five minutes.<br> - I've been a friend!<br> Go down and make<br> Mr. Babcock feel at home.<br> But the theater guild!<br> Get out of my way! What am I gonna<br> do with this damn stinking halo?<br> You want?<br> I'm Mr. Babcock.<br> Miss Dennis is expecting me.<br> - You come in.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I take coat?<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> - You sit.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr. Babcock? We've been expecting you.<br> My name is Patrick Dennis.<br> - Please sit down.<br> - Fine. Fine.<br> Auntie Mame will be right down.<br> She's having a little trouble<br> with her halo.<br> She'll be right down.<br> You look like a bully little chap.<br> Yes, sir, a bully little chap.<br> - You look very bully too.<br> - Yes.<br> Would you care<br> for a martini, Mr. Babcock?<br> Dry or extra dry?<br> Sit down, please. I'll make them<br> like I do for Mr. Woolcott.<br> Stir, never shake. Bruises the gin.<br> Would you care for an olive?<br> Auntie Mame says olives take up<br> too much room in such a little glass.<br> Why, Mr. Babcock!<br> What an honor it is<br> to have you in our little home.<br> I wonder if it makes the best first<br> impression on a sensitive young mind...<br> ...to see you drinking<br> during business hours.<br> - But he...<br> - I won't breathe a word to the bank.<br> Just one minute.<br> Where did he learn to mix...?<br> Mr. Babcock, knowledge is power.<br> That is exactly what I'm here for.<br> To discuss this boy's proper education.<br> Nuts?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> He won't have to worry about his<br> future. His money is in steady bonds.<br> You'll agree that it's time he be<br> enrolled in an institution of learning.<br> - I'm already enrolled in...<br> - Let Mr. Babcock talk.<br> I've gone to pains to gather information<br> on some better boys' schools in town.<br> - I prefer coeducational schools.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Coeducational means when boys<br> and girls go to school together.<br> First, the Bixby School<br> which is known to be splendid.<br> Have you considered a school<br> run by Acacius Page?<br> It follows ancient Greek principles...<br> Your brother's will was most specific.<br> Conservative schooling, he said.<br> There's my alma mater,<br> St. Boniface in Massachusetts.<br> It's too far.<br> You'd better settle<br> on the Browning School.<br> It is known to be conservative<br> and this gives the boys basic...<br> - That's enough candy, dear.<br> - Sorry.<br> Not you, Mr. Babcock.<br> You can have all you want.<br> Have you thought of<br> the Dillman School? It's here...<br> Too experimental. You wanna keep<br> the riffraff out of the boy's life.<br> The school must be exclusive<br> and restricted.<br> Exclusively what<br> and restricted to whom?<br> We must spare the boy<br> certain influences...<br> ...from the wrong side of the tracks,<br> shall we say?<br> - Mr. Babbitt...<br> - Babcock.<br> - Yes. It was very good of you to come.<br> - What school will it be?<br> Name the school, and Patrick<br> and I will know what to do.<br> - I'd say Bixby.<br> - Then bully for Bixby.<br> I'll make out a check to Bixby School.<br> You register him.<br> Whatever you say.<br> I say I'm very happy to have met you.<br> After the reports I'd heard,<br> I was prejudiced, and not in your favor.<br> But I find you a woman<br> with a very powerful charm.<br> And you're a man<br> with a very powerful bank.<br> Floor all scrubbed.<br> Clean just like old country.<br> I go now. Get lamb chops,<br> bottle of milk for boy.<br> - Pick up my coat!<br> - Bye, Aunt Vera!<br> Bye, kid!<br> Don't drop anything. What a marvelous<br> day! October's bright, blue weather.<br> All we've seen was the store.<br> Haven't even called my office.<br> Oh, stop complaining, Lindsay.<br> When are we going<br> to have time to ourselves?<br> I've had to make up Patrick's 10<br> neglected years in a matter of months.<br> Dr. Spock says it's impossible.<br> Does Dr. Spock mention<br> that a child needs a father?<br> There are a lot of women<br> who think I'm attractive.<br> Don't start that! How can I be a wife?<br> I'm too busy being a mother.<br> Oh, I forgot. One moment!<br> Thank you.<br> My hat! Thank you.<br> I hope Patrick likes the chemistry set,<br> the books, the atlas, the Kipling.<br> - I don't like your latest fad.<br> - Fad? Patrick?<br> I've seen you through yogi,<br> sculpture, dance and foods.<br> You take each as if nothing else<br> existed. Then you drop them.<br> You think he's a temporary enthusiasm?<br> - It's called "molding a new life."<br> - You've been in some mood.<br> - You deceitful, irresponsible bohemian!<br> - Whatever do you mean?<br> - You're not fit to raise a child!<br> - Something's happened?<br> Come here, you heathen!<br> - What's wrong?<br> - He came to my school...<br> I dropped by the Bixby School<br> and what did I find?<br> I find he isn't even registered!<br> I hunted through<br> every low, crackpot school.<br> - I found him in the lowest of them.<br> - Mr. Page is progressive.<br> There they were!<br> A room full of them!<br> Boys, girls, teachers, romping around<br> naked, bare as the day they were born.<br> The children were engaged in<br> normal, healthful, broadening pursuits.<br> Broadening? Show them what<br> you were doing when I broke in.<br> We were playing fish families.<br> It's part of constructive play.<br> - Listen to this.<br> - Show me.<br> We do it right after yogurt time.<br> Mrs. Page and all the girls<br> crouch down under the sun lamps...<br> ...pretending to be lady fishes<br> depositing their eggs in the sand.<br> Then Mr. Page and all the boys<br> do what gentlemen fish do.<br> What could be more wholesome<br> or natural?<br> Natural? Well, it might<br> be natural for a sardine!<br> Mr. Babcock, I consider<br> your behavior most undignified.<br> Undignified? At least I wear a vest.<br> Making a scene. Causing<br> a traumatic experience for this child.<br> I know how you twist things around.<br> I'm getting out of this nudist camp...<br> ...before you make me look<br> like the president of free love.<br> Mr. Babcock,<br> not in front of the B-O-Y.<br> Tomorrow morning I'm taking<br> this kid off to boarding school.<br> I am placing him<br> in St. Boniface Academy.<br> You'll only get him<br> Christmas and summer.<br> - I wish I could stop you from that!<br> - Do I have to?<br> - Please, I'll do whatever you say.<br> - Not on your life! He goes tomorrow.<br> - Let's be reasonable.<br> - I'll make him a decent Christian...<br> ...if I have to break his bones.<br> Give me another chance.<br> I wouldn't give you the time<br> after the double-cross you pulled.<br> But he's all that I have!<br> Have him ready at 8:00 sharp tomorrow.<br> Kid, you'd better be wearing knickers!<br> I want to stay with you, Auntie Mame.<br> I don't want go to St. Bony-face.<br> Now, hush.<br> Hush, my little love.<br> I'm sure St. Boniface<br> is really very nice.<br> You go upstairs now, dear...<br> ...and get ready for dinner.<br> We'll talk about it later.<br> Lindsay.<br> Lindsay, what am I going to do?<br> Mame, I'm sorry.<br> Well, I...<br> I just don't think I can bear it.<br> I just don't.<br> Mame.<br> I've never seen you cry before.<br> Mame!<br> - Mame, are you home?<br> - Is that you, Vera?<br> What on earth does she want?<br> Have you talked to your stockbroker?<br> Yes, I can see you have.<br> - What about her stockbroker?<br> - He's trying to locate both of you.<br> - What happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> Except nothing's worth<br> anything anymore.<br> - Hello.<br> - Now, don't you worry.<br> It can't affect us. We own solid stuff<br> like Bank of the United States.<br> Missy Dennis, stockbroker want to say<br> hello before he jump out of window.<br> How bad is it, Arthur?<br> Not Bank of the United States.<br> Atwater Kent too?<br> Mame, I'm afraid you're wiped out.<br> We all are.<br> Everyone said I was a fool<br> spending all my money at Tiffany's.<br> Who cares about money?<br> I've lost my child.<br> - What?<br> - Patrick's trustee is sending him away.<br> Oh, Mame, darling.<br> I know how you must feel.<br> - Do you?<br> - Well, of course I do.<br> I never had a child,<br> but I'm an actress. I can imagine.<br> There must be something I can do.<br> I've got it! The perfect solution.<br> It'll solve everything. You'll work.<br> - Work?<br> - You'll return to the stage...<br> ...in my play, Midsummer Madness.<br> There are dozens of parts.<br> We open Thanksgiving in New Haven.<br> I'll call Max.<br> - Do you think I could?<br> - Of course you could. Couldn't she?<br> You'll have to work at something.<br> The only chance to get Patrick back<br> is to show Babcock...<br> ...that you've settled down<br> into something steady.<br> Or to earn money to fight him with.<br> You're so right!<br> - About $500 a week to start.<br> - It'll be a bit in the last act.<br> Then there'll be a raise. I accept!<br> Your heart is from Tiffany's too.<br> It'll be like old times...<br> ...when we were trooping together<br> in Chu Chin Girl. I can't wait!<br> This is a serious drama.<br> I was in front. Vera was behind me.<br> If I'd been behind you,<br> I'd have kicked...<br> I know exactly what I did.<br> It used to go:<br> That's it!<br> - An appalling situation.<br> - Frightful, my dear.<br> Where's Miss Dennis?<br> Keep your shirt on!<br> She's still making up.<br> She has a lousy two-line bit.<br> She's had two acts to make up.<br> Make sure she knows her entrance<br> is from the other side.<br> But in all fairness to him,<br> I believe she's been leading him on.<br> After all, she is a princess.<br> He, a commoner.<br> Everybody into the solarium.<br> I think I hear them coming now.<br> But, Reginald, to do such a thing!<br> To dash away together like this<br> would be mad.<br> Quite devastatingly mad.<br> Quite devastatingly mad.<br> Lord Dudley, your flattery would turn<br> a young girl's head.<br> Come now. Hurry to the ball.<br> If we tarry, we shall be late.<br> No, it would be madness.<br> I belong to one world, you to another.<br> It's better we part now.<br> Now, while we cherish<br> this ecstasy we've known.<br> What have you got back there,<br> reindeer?<br> This is goodbye, Reginald.<br> I hear the others coming.<br> Lord Dudley, no more champagne<br> or I shall forget myself altogether.<br> - I have... I have...<br> - I must say, you're the funniest man.<br> I have something to tell you!<br> I have been unexpectedly<br> called back home.<br> Prince Alex needs me<br> and my place is by his side.<br> It has been so lovely<br> this whole summer.<br> But after all, it has only been<br> midsummer madness.<br> Lady Iris, would you be good enough<br> to ring for my wrap?<br> Certainly, princess.<br> And get rid of those damn cowbells!<br> - May I help you, princess?<br> - Thank you, Lady Iris.<br> Goodbye, goodbye.<br> I shall always feel<br> a strong attachment to you all.<br> - Let go!<br> - I can't. I'm stuck.<br> Let go!<br> - It's my bracelet. It's caught on you.<br> - Bring down the curtain!<br> I was only...<br> Ruining my beautiful play<br> with your lousy bell ringing!<br> These are the only bracelets<br> I have in the world.<br> Enough! That's enough!<br> - Okay, strike the set!<br> - Why?<br> - I thought I'd give her character.<br> - You scene-stealing, society biddy!<br> You destroyed me!<br> There were critics out there!<br> We're all ruined!<br> Don't let me catch the sight of<br> your evil face again, you assassin!<br> But, Vera... You see...<br> I felt if I should make<br> something out of...<br> There weren't<br> many lines, and I felt...<br> Ms. Charles asked...<br> I thought you were very good,<br> Auntie Mame. Everybody noticed you.<br> My little love.<br> How did you get up to New Haven?<br> lto brought me up.<br> How could lto drive you up?<br> I sold the car.<br> He didn't drive. We hitchhiked.<br> Mr. Babcock thinks you're in school.<br> It's all right.<br> It's Thanksgiving vacation.<br> Is it?<br> Can I be your escort?<br> Can I take you back to your hotel?<br> You can take me all the way<br> back to New York.<br> Patrick.<br> Oh, Patrick.<br> Are you ashamed of your Auntie Mame?<br> I'm proud of you!<br> Nobody liked the stinky old play<br> at all until you came in.<br> Lady Iris?<br> Charmed...<br> ...Lord Dudley.<br> Widdicombe, Gutterman,<br> Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.<br> You want to talk to Mr. Gutterman?<br> I'll connect you.<br> Widdicombe, Gutterman,<br> Applewhite, Bibberman and Black.<br> Yes, Mr. Bibberman.

Cash?<br> Just Oglethorpe Orphanage,<br> Georgia.<br> Wouldn't you prefer<br> if I sent them COD?<br> The nippers wouldn't think<br> much of their Santa Claus...<br> ...if he filled their stockings<br> with bills for collection on delivery.<br> I haven't worked here long.<br> The only kind of sales slip<br> I know how to make out is COD.<br> I might be of assistance here.<br> - We'd get in a lot of trouble.<br> - I'm familiar with financial matters.<br> First, get your duplicates<br> and triplicates straightened out.<br> Mr. Macy wouldn't have any way<br> of knowing what you sold.<br> - That's why they have tissue paper!<br> - A nice, new order blank.<br> First name:<br> Beauregard...<br> ...Jackson Pickett Burnside.<br> That's a lot.<br> You took up all that space.<br> Ms. Dennis! May I inquire<br> what is going on here?<br> - He was helping me with the slip.<br> - This young lady, Ms. Dennis...<br> ...was having trouble with the sales<br> slip for skates. I was helping her.<br> - Was there something unusual?<br> - Yes, he wanted to pay cash.<br> A Macy employee doesn't know<br> how to make a cash sale?<br> I'm a whiz at CODs.<br> You can tell.<br> Ms. Dennis, this sales book<br> is a shambles!<br> Goodbye, everybody,<br> and Merry Christmas.<br> That young lady was doing<br> the best she knew!<br> I consider myself<br> responsible for this!<br> The thing is a misunderstanding.<br> Don't forget the skates<br> for the little nippers!<br> Get them at Gimbels!<br> I'm not finished decorating yet.<br> You're home early.<br> They gave me my Christmas<br> vacation a little bit early.<br> I'm glad, because now<br> it fits with your vacation.<br> We won't miss even a day together.<br> Patrick, that's beautiful.<br> A genuine Picasso, huh?<br> His black and blue period.<br> It's almost a week till Christmas.<br> But open it.<br> Patrick, where did you get the money?<br> Mr. Leavitt down at the pawnshop...<br> ...gave me a good price for<br> my hockey stick and microscope.<br> - I was getting tired of microbes.<br> - Now, you know you...<br> - My, my, my, my.<br> - They're not quite diamonds.<br> Oh, darling, that's the most beautiful<br> bracelet I ever owned.<br> Wiggle it.<br> See, it doesn't make any noise.<br> I told the man you had to have<br> a quiet one for when you go on-stage.<br> Wear it with your mink coat.<br> You'll make a sensation at Macy's.<br> I've already made<br> a sensation at Macy's.<br> My mink coat is down at Mr. Leavitt's<br> with your microscope.<br> If we're going to have Christmas,<br> let's have it all around.<br> Norah, lto!

Vultures!<br> - Good afternoon.<br> Now, Ms. Burnside,<br> that doesn't include me, does it?<br> No, Sally Cato, you ain't no vulture.<br> You're just a dead pigeon.<br> I can't see how you got<br> Beauregard out of your nest.<br> You should've sat on him.<br> Son? We got our sweet<br> Georgia peaches right here.<br> Don't know why you had to go<br> and bring back a Northern lemon.<br> Let's keep our grits going<br> in the right direction.<br> My Auntie Mame, Miss Dennis,<br> says she'll be here in a moment.<br> Well, now, what a lovable,<br> genteel little gentleman!<br> You and my brother<br> are gonna get along...<br> ...like a pair of colts in a pasture,<br> I can just tell.<br> Emory!<br> - Your sister's nice.<br> - Nice?<br> You're plumb crazy. She's the meanest<br> damn filly in the entire South.<br> Mame, where are you?<br> We're all waiting on you.<br> - I'm coming, Beau, sugar.<br> - There we are, honey.<br> I'm sorry to keep you waiting.<br> I'm just busting to meet your mother.<br> Mother, dear, I'd like<br> to present Miss Mame Dennis.<br> Well, I...<br> I must say, Mrs. Burnside,<br> you're everything I ever expected.<br> - And quite more.<br> - And these here are my...<br> Bless you.<br> These are the rest of my kin.<br> The Jacksons, Picketts, Burnsides.<br> This is Sally Cato MacDougal.<br> Stay out here and have a nice chat.<br> I'm gonna fix you a drink.<br> And then we're gonna run along down<br> and I'll have you meet my horses.<br> Well, I...<br> I can't tell you how charming<br> it is to meet all of...<br> ...you all.<br> Tell me, Miss Dennis...<br> May I call you "Mame"?<br> - Please do.<br> - And you call me Sally Cato.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Tell me...<br> ...was it horses brought you<br> and Beauregard together?<br> A horse is the most important<br> thing in his life.<br> I love riding. In New York, hardly a<br> day goes by, I don't have boots on.<br> Up every morning at dawn<br> for a ride through Central Park.<br> That settles it. In your honor,<br> we've got to have a hunt.<br> A hunt? Oh, a hunt. A hunt?!<br> Everybody, Beauregard's gone<br> and surprised us all!<br> She's a prominent Northern horsewoman.<br> Naturally, we've got to have a hunt.<br> Dawn, tomorrow morning.<br> Everybody's invited!<br> Won't we have a lark?<br> The sun up...<br> ...leaping over hedges, jumping over<br> river gaps and the hounds yapping!<br> Every eye in this county<br> will be on you tomorrow.<br> I didn't bring any of my riding togs.<br> Don't worry, I got dozens<br> of things you can wear.<br> - What's your shoe size?<br> - 3B.<br> That's marvelous! Same as I wear.<br> You do ride astride, Mame, dear?<br> No, sidesaddle. Daddy,<br> the colonel, insisted that I learn it.<br> He said it was the only way for a lady<br> to ride, so graceful. Silly of him.<br> Nobody rides sidesaddle now,<br> but it's the only way I know.<br> Now, isn't that just grand?<br> I just happen to have a little<br> sidesaddle that'll do you fine.<br> - Refreshments?<br> - Beau, darling...<br> ...we're having a hunt. Your sweet<br> Yankee girl is riding sidesaddle!<br> - I won't permit it. It's too dangerous!<br> - But, darling, she's insisted.<br> Well, anything that Mame says<br> she can do, she can do.<br> I tell you, she's an amazing woman.<br> Mame, sugar...<br> ...l'm just gonna hold my breath<br> until dawn tomorrow.<br> Do that, honey.<br> Stop looking at the pictures.<br> Read it to me, I'm listening.<br> "How to Ride a Horse."<br> It says, "Always get on the horse<br> from the left side."<br> - My left side or the horse's left side?<br> - It doesn't say. Listen to this.<br> "Whenever approaching<br> a strange mount...<br> ...fix the animal in the eye<br> with a masterful gaze.<br> Remain calm, for a horse has<br> a highly developed sense of smell...<br> ...and can react dangerously<br> when he smells fear."<br> I hope he likes Chanel No. 5.<br> I didn't know this.<br> "Horses aren't native to America."<br> Read me something useful.<br> I'm about to go over the top.<br> Clearing fences.<br> It says you should always lean.<br> Jumping water hazards.<br> "Don't lean. Sit erect."<br> Don't lean. Sit erect.<br> Say your prayers.<br> Be good to Norah and lto<br> after I'm gone.<br> I think Sally left a foot in this one.<br> - Let me help you.<br> - No, darling. It's no use.<br> Why are you going through all this?<br> If I can snag you an Uncle Beau,<br> all our problems will be solved.<br> Besides, there's another minor,<br> relatively unimportant thing:<br> I happen to be in love with him.<br> I like Beau. I like him a lot.<br> Then it's all settled!<br> Not so fast,<br> he hasn't asked me anything yet.<br> - You dressed yet, Mame, honey?<br> - Come in, Beau, darling.<br> - Oh, my, how handsome you look!<br> - Well, likewise, Mame.<br> Hold it steady,<br> I want to get a picture of this.<br> That's it. Now, give me<br> a nice pose, Mame, darling.<br> And big smile! That's a girl.<br> There we are. You have now<br> been immortalized in celluloid.<br> Patrick.<br> You must have left it in my room.<br> I'll find it.<br> Mame...<br> Thank you.<br> I've got something to say. I'll have<br> to say it fast or not say it at all.<br> Talk slow then, Beau, darling.<br> I can listen fast.<br> Well, Mame, you and I don't<br> exactly come from the same world.<br> Not that I think I'm worth...<br> There comes a time in every life...<br> Mame, I'm just gonna have<br> to come right out and say it.<br> Well, I'm gonna ask you to...<br> Mame, would you...?<br> - I mean, could you...?<br> - Mame! Mame, darling!<br> It's me, Sally Cato!<br> I wanted to see if there was anything...<br> Oh, hello, Beau.<br> Was I interrupting?<br> There's the signal, darling!<br> Come on, let's hurry.<br> - Well, shall we to the hounds?<br> - Yeah, I'd love to meet your family.<br> - We almost thought you wasn't coming.<br> - Morning. Lovely day for a hunt.<br> Sugar, you look absolutely dreamy.<br> Say, boys, you can bring<br> Miss Dennis' horse around now!<br> Well, what a break.<br> Glorious weather for the hunt.<br> I thought it might rain,<br> we'd call it off.<br> Well, where are we riding to?<br> Outside of the hounds, of course.<br> It's a good 10-mile course,<br> for those that makes it.<br> - I can try.<br> - This way, Auntie Mame.<br> - Morning, Miss Dennis.<br> - Morning.<br> Well, has he?<br> Not yet. So I die an old maid<br> sometime before lunch.<br> No, you won't. You look convincing,<br> like a magazine cover.<br> Horror Stories.<br> - What's in there?<br> - That's the horse I picked out for you.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Meditation.<br> I'll trip you. You'd only break a leg.<br> I can't disgrace Beau,<br> not in front of all these people.<br> Fix the animal in the eye<br> with a masterful gaze.<br> Fix the master in the eye<br> with an animal gaze.<br> Fix the aster in the maze<br> with an animal guy.<br> You look fit. They're bringing<br> the fox up from the icehouse.<br> Come on, let's go, everybody!<br> Goodbye, Yankee gal!<br> - Where does she think she's going?<br> - Look at him go!<br> - Fall off! Fall off!<br> - Look out for that flood wall!<br> - Auntie Mame, fall off! Fall off!<br> - Look out! Look out!<br> Danged if she didn't sail<br> clear over it! No hands!<br> Look at her! She's passing everybody!<br> She's passing the master<br> of the hounds! Very bad form.<br> She's passing the dogs!<br> Mother of Jefferson Davis,<br> she's passing the fox!<br> Ms. Burnside! I was driving by.<br> I thought I saw...<br> - That couldn't be Meditation!<br> - Yes, fine bit of horseflesh.<br> He's a killer! I gotta stop this!<br> They're headed back this way!<br> Stay out of the flowerbed!<br> Get that horse out of my bougainvillea!<br> She's heading for the icehouse!<br> That's my car! That's county property!<br> Mame!<br> - Mame, where are you?<br> - She come this way.<br> There you are!<br> Darling, are you all right?<br> If I hadn't grabbed on to this,<br> I'd have been in Nova Scotia!<br> - What happened to the fox?<br> - Poor thing is all tuckered out.<br> Oh, my little love!<br> As county veterinarian, I commanded you<br> two years ago to destroy that horse!<br> Letting her ride this horse,<br> superb horsewoman that she is...<br> ...that was premeditated murder!<br> Let's have three cheers, everybody,<br> for my little Yankee!<br> What a seat that woman has!<br> What a magnificent seat!<br> Look here, everybody,<br> I want three cheers...<br> ...for the future Mrs. Beauregard<br> Jackson Pickett Burnside!<br> - Hip, hip...<br> - Hooray!<br> - Hip, hip...<br> - Hooray!<br> Emory, come on home!<br> Hot damn!<br> My sister's gonna bust a gut!<br> What are y'all standing around for?<br> Come back to the house.<br> We'll have a glass of whiskey.<br> - Oh, Beau!<br> - Come on, Mame, darling.<br> Here we are. Take it easy, now.<br> Mame, I'm sorry about making<br> my proposal so public...<br> ...but I'm gonna do everything I can<br> to make you happy.<br> Of course, you'll have to educate me.<br> Make me more cosmopolitan.<br> For a honeymoon, let's take a trip<br> around the world for a few years.<br> Oh, Beau! That's...<br> - Darling, excuse me a minute.<br> - Sure.<br> - My little love.<br> - Congratulations, Auntie Mame.<br> Your Auntie Mame's in love<br> and very happy.<br> I won't see you for a long time.<br> Patrick, nothing can ever<br> really separate us.<br> You'll join us on all your vacations.<br> The rest of the time,<br> you'll be busy at school.<br> I'll just have two men instead of one.<br> And I'll write to you every day,<br> I promise.<br> You don't think I'd run off and<br> abandon you to the Babcocks, do you?<br> You're stuck with me<br> whether you like it or not.<br> Now let me see you smile.<br> I want to see it.<br> Where is it? That's my boy!<br> Can I ask you just one question?<br> How did you stay on that horse?<br> It's like New Haven with the bracelet.<br> I got stuck, but at the other end.<br> "Dear Auntie Mame: I plan to spend this<br> holiday with Mr. Babcock in Darien."<br> - Hold it right there, darling.<br> - Now, no higher, Beau.<br> "Junior Babcock<br> and I have fun there...<br> ...and I have met the kids from all<br> the best families in Connecticut."<br> Oh, dear.<br> I have a feeling we should be<br> getting back. Patrick needs me.<br> - That last one was the best one yet.<br> - Good, darling.<br> - Now, did you put film in this time?<br> - I sure did.<br> - Oh, dang!<br> - Up, up, Rover! Up, up!<br> - Mrs. Burnside.<br> - Mr. Babcock.<br> - So good to see you again.<br> - Thank you. Nice to see you.<br> Darling!<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mame! Up here, Mame, honey!<br> That's it. Give me a nice smile.<br> I gotcha.<br> Mame, honey. Look up here.<br> Come, Patrick. Do be careful, darling.<br> Now, give me a nice smile.<br> Patrick, take off your hat.<br> Now, give me a nice smile.<br> That's it.<br> I got it.<br> - Dennis?<br> - Hey, Dennis!<br> - Sign here.<br> - It's another one for you! Dennis!<br> Siam this time.<br> Thanks.<br> Siam. "Dear Patrick:<br> Here's a handy woman to have<br> around the house. Love, Auntie Mame."<br> Here we are, darling.<br> You all right?<br> Next time, let's take the elevator.<br> It's 10,000 feet up.<br> We only got another mile to go.<br> Why don't you stay here<br> and rest a while?<br> I'll go up and get some film of you.<br> - I'll finish Patrick's letter.<br> - All right.<br> "Have to dash.<br> Dinner at Uncle Dwight's.<br> That's Babcock,<br> the baboon-faced boy to you.<br> Old Babcock's introducing me<br> to all the blond heiresses...<br> ...on the Eastern seaboard."<br> Blond heiresses? Dwight?<br> Beau? Beau!<br> I knew that letter was worrying you.<br> I already made reservations back.<br> Good. Well then, let's get back down.<br> Wait a minute,<br> I still got a little more film left.<br> Mame, would you mind<br> stepping back just a bit?<br> - I'd rather not.<br> - Never mind, I'll scale up higher.<br> Now, Beau, no higher!<br> Take this.<br> It keeps on getting in my way.<br> Take hold of the other end<br> for your balance.<br> Don't you worry.<br> Just be looking out at the view there.<br> Hold it now, will you?<br> Now, you hold on tight while I re-focus.<br> Heavens, this looks like<br> the main chapel of a funeral parlor.<br> - Haven't Norah and lto been alerted?<br> - They'll be here tomorrow.<br> - What's that thing supposed to be?<br> - A Dictaphone.<br> She'll never use it. Patrick's carried<br> all this junk up here for nothing.<br> Mame can't stay still long enough<br> to write a postcard, let alone a book.<br> No, he was right.<br> Mame can't go on living in a vacuum.<br> - She's always got to have a project.<br> - She's got one.<br> Now, she's the tragic queen.<br> She's having such fun being miserable.<br> All she's done for 10 months is revisit<br> the places she's been with Beau.<br> Eight times, she climbed the Matterhorn<br> to throw rose petals down the glacier.<br> I should have gone to meet her.<br> I haven't seen her since the funeral.<br> Wasn't it just like Mame<br> to keep him till I got there?<br> Listen, you cynic, she was in love<br> with him. She's changed, I tell you.<br> Look, I'll get some champagne.<br> I'll answer it.<br> Mame!<br> She can't have changed that much.<br> - I'm from Speed-O.<br> - You're what?<br> Patrick called a secretarial service.<br> Your name?<br> Agnes Gooch.<br> You'll be taking dictation from<br> Mrs. Burnside. She talks very fast.<br> Speed-O won't let anybody out<br> who can't do 180 words a minute.<br> - I'm over 200.<br> - No, you're not.<br> She may let loose<br> with a million words and ideas.<br> Soak them all up, like a sponge.<br> Speed-O better have symbols<br> for four-letter words.<br> Lindsay, Mame will never write a book.<br> But Patrick got a fella to help her.<br> He'll be here at 3:00.<br> What fella?<br> - That's the signal.<br> - What signal?<br> Patrick wants us to surprise Mame.<br> Come on, hide. In there, quick!<br> You too, Miss Gooch.<br> Why are you ringing?<br> Don't you have a key?<br> Oh, of course! What am I thinking of?<br> Welcome home.<br> Good old Beekman Place.<br> Always so loyal.<br> No matter how far I go, it waits<br> for me. I hope you used it weekends.<br> No, I didn't. I usually go from school<br> to Connecticut, to Uncle Dwight's.<br> I did rather expect Vera<br> to be down at the boat.<br> I wouldn't let her.<br> I wanted to be alone with you.<br> Patrick! My little Patrick.<br> Now, open your presents.<br> I can't get over it. Every time I see<br> you, you're taller and more grown-up.<br> Oh, golly, short pants! At last.<br> Can I try them on right now?<br> Right now.<br> Surprise! Welcome home, Mame!<br> Vera.<br> And dear, staunch, stalwart Lindsay.<br> How good of you both to rally<br> around this bereft old woman.<br> - Doesn't she look great?<br> - How can you tell?<br> Couldn't you have gone<br> to purple by now?<br> Come on, Auntie Mame,<br> champagne and fishberry jam.<br> No, Patrick. The bubbles<br> no longer tickle my nose.<br> I've given up alcohol,<br> along with everything else.<br> It's wonderful of you all.<br> Very touching, but... What's that?<br> It's your Dictaphone<br> and your typewriter.<br> - And what's that?<br> - I'm your sponge.<br> - This is your secretary.<br> - My secretary?<br> - Yes. You'll write your autobiography.<br> - Me? Write a book?<br> No one's had a more colorful life.<br> You've known fascinating people:<br> Winston Churchill, Gandhi, me.<br> You'll be so busy digging up the past,<br> you won't think of the present.<br> - And I promise to publish it.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> This is some sort of conspiracy.<br> Some trumped-up occupational therapy,<br> like basket weaving.<br> I swear, it'll be a bestseller.<br> And you'd be doing me a favor.<br> - My memoirs? Patrick, my drink.<br> - Champagne?<br> Anything, just make it double. I see<br> it in two volumes. Boxed, like Proust.<br> - Let me see. Chapter one, page one.<br> - She's supposed to start right now?<br> This isn't so difficult. Another drink.<br> Where was I? Chapter one, page one...<br> - What are you writing?<br> - "Chapter one, page one.<br> This isn't so difficult. Another drink.<br> Where was I? What are you writing?"<br> She is fast.<br> You're off and running.<br> Should I do this? lt'll take up all<br> my time. I came home to be with you.<br> After all, you can't be with me.<br> No women in the dorm.<br> I forgot, you're grown-up now.<br> You don't need me anymore.<br> Nobody needs me anymore. It's sad...<br> How do you turn her off?<br> The most important thing is<br> to have a good beginning.<br> - Wait for your collaborator.<br> - Collaborator?<br> Yes. My friend got a kind<br> of editor to work with you.<br> Fella named O'Bannion.<br> You don't trust me to write<br> my own life? He got me a ghost!<br> - It's not a ghost.<br> - I see it all now. A ghostwriter!<br> I won't expose my life<br> to some beer-drinking Irishman...<br> ...who leads a low, common life<br> in some Third Avenue bar!<br> You don't trust me to write my life?<br> Who else could write it?<br> Whoever this creature is...<br> Mr. O'Bannion to see you.<br> I was asked to drop by to meet<br> the fabulous Mrs. Burnside.<br> You are she, of course.<br> I can sense the aura<br> of creative vitality about you.<br> Won't you come in, Mr. O'Bannion?<br> I thought by way<br> of introduction, Mrs. Burnside...<br> ...l'd present you with a slim volume<br> of my poems, The Parched Garden.<br> What a lovely title. Thank you.<br> Do you mind if I sit down?<br> That long ride up in the elevator,<br> it's after getting me dizzy.<br> - I'll get you a bit of water.<br> - No, please don't bother.<br> Of course, a bit of champagne,<br> if it's handy.<br> Patrick.<br> It seems to help.<br> Thank you.<br> It's the other one.<br> Tell me, how did it happen?<br> Well, it was in 1922.<br> The Great Rebellion.<br> Even a lad of 15 can feel strongly<br> about his country's independence.<br> How nice.<br> Tell me, Mr. O'Bannion.<br> Do you think you and I<br> can ever get anyplace?<br> With the book, I mean.<br> Well, we've both known sorrow.<br> I feel that you and I are going<br> to create something.<br> Something beautiful.<br> Actually, my child, it was so sad.<br> Mother died in childbirth.<br> It was a dreadful thing.<br> And Father traveled all the time.<br> How difficult he was.<br> But I must be fair to Father.<br> Remind me to do a whole new chapter<br> about him. No, no, take that out.<br> And I had to start working<br> when I was 8.<br> I went next door and said,<br> "Can I baby-sit? Can I do something?"<br> After all, I was a child. I said,<br> "I need clothes. Parties. Pretties."<br> Please.<br> Please, Miss Gooch!<br> How can I court the muse<br> with all that clackety-clack?<br> I'm sorry. I'm only taking off<br> what Mrs. Burnside dictated.<br> Everything Mrs. Burnside<br> dictates is so wonderful.<br> When I think of the things<br> she's done...<br> ...and think of the things<br> I haven't done, I could just die.<br> But it's so exciting<br> being in this house.<br> Just imagine, a Japanese houseboy...<br> ...all those artistic friends...<br> ...and you, Mr. O'Bannion.<br> I'll get it, Brian. Hello.<br> Hello, Lindsay.<br> It's coming along.<br> Well, it's only been three months.<br> Brian is polishing and perfecting it.<br> A party? Oh, I'd...<br> No, I'm afraid not.<br> Brian couldn't possibly...<br> What is it, my dear?<br> Lindsay feels that Warner Bros.<br> might pay for our book...<br> ...as a vehicle for Bette Davis. He's<br> meeting Jack Warner tonight, but l...<br> Mrs. Burnside and I couldn't<br> possibly allow our work...<br> ...to be defiled<br> by a movie company.<br> But, just as a courtesy,<br> we'll come and discuss it.<br> About 8:30? A black tie?<br> All right, and thank you very much.<br> Goodbye.<br> Brian, you accepted! It might do you<br> good to get back in the world.<br> - Here's what you dictated.<br> - Thank you.<br> And here's what Mr. O'Bannion edited.<br> Mr. O'Bannion and I are going to work,<br> so why don't you do...<br> ...whatever it is you do do to relax.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Burnside.<br> I think I'll just fix myself<br> a Dr. Pepper.<br> I'm worried.<br> We have little to show Mr. Warner.<br> We'll tell him the story. How long<br> will it take to finish this book?<br> Flaubert spent 13 years<br> on Madame Bovary.<br> - Where were we?<br> - Give us our last sentence.<br> "My puberty in Buffalo was drab."<br> Oh, no, no. It has no majesty.<br> "Drab" is such a drab word.<br> How right you are, Brian.<br> It has no afflatus.<br> What about "bleak"?<br> Bleak? Bleak.<br> How bleak was my puberty.<br> Bleak Buffalo! Hear how<br> the words cling to each other?<br> Like a man and woman in each other's<br> arms. Listen to the words sing!<br> How bleak was my puberty!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Come, Mame. Let us lie down in front<br> of the fire and stare at the flames.<br> It will help stir the flames<br> of our inspiration.<br> Yes. Well, now, Brian.<br> Will the general public understand<br> all this symbolism?<br> "Like an echo from the caves<br> of Kakamora...<br> ...I came forth whilst Deirdre<br> wept cool tears."<br> Wouldn't it be simpler to say, "The<br> day I was born, it rained in Buffalo"?<br> - It's drab.<br> - It's drab, but it's clear.<br> Here is clarity. I stayed awake half<br> the night to sift it from obscurity.<br> In the blank gray midnight<br> of me haunted garden<br> Your soft form appeared raining<br> kisses on the parched earth of me lips.<br> What's come over you?<br> Now, you mustn't!<br> Besides, it takes Agnes no time at all<br> to knock off a Dr. Pepper.<br> Brian, you mustn't!<br> Do not withdraw this wondrous water,<br> for without you...<br> I rinsed out the glass.<br> Aren't you neat?<br> It came from the fiber of my being.<br> That's why I'm so tired today.<br> You could revitalize me<br> with a single, motherly kiss.<br> What's happened to you?<br> - I'm revitalized!<br> - You're recharged.<br> Don't you come near me!<br> You're old enough to be my mother!<br> I'm going to your room...<br> I mean, my room. Ito!<br> - You'll kill yourself.<br> - What a way to die. I'm mad for you.<br> You've poured your strength into me.<br> And I want to pour it right back.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> It's like having a crush<br> on your teacher. Or your analyst.<br> Stop it!<br> Hello, anybody?<br> Patrick.<br> Hello, Auntie Mame.<br> - Hello, Dennis.<br> - I'm so glad to see you, darling.<br> Mrs. Burnside and I were<br> just working on the book.<br> - I bet that's gonna be some book.<br> - Why are you home from school?<br> I had to talk to you.<br> You have things to talk about.<br> I'll go to my room and change.<br> - His room? Is he living here?<br> - Of course.<br> He was living in some miserable flat.<br> Since we're working together<br> night and day...<br> Let me tell you something about<br> that spiritual Irish poet...<br> You don't have to tell me a thing.<br> It looks very cozy.<br> For a minute, you sounded like<br> someone from the Knickerbocker Bank.<br> Please get O'Bannion out of here.<br> Right away.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I don't want him in this house.<br> Aren't you taking rather an imperious<br> tone? Mr. O'Bannion is my colleague.<br> Colleague, my foot!<br> Gloria would never understand...<br> Who is Gloria?<br> Auntie Mame, listen to me.<br> I've met a girl.<br> I've been going with her<br> for several months.<br> She's a very special girl, and...<br> I should have told you<br> about her before.<br> I would have, but I knew you<br> were tied up with the book...<br> ...and everything.<br> And until now it wasn't definite.<br> What's definite now?<br> Gloria's the girl.<br> That's what's definite.<br> - You're going to meet her. Tonight.<br> - You didn't leave her in the car?<br> I left her at her girlfriend's house.<br> She wanted to spruce up.<br> - I'd better spruce up too.<br> - I'll bring her in 10 minutes.<br> I'll have my face all organized.<br> What did you do with<br> me evening slippers?<br> - It's all right. I found them.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> If he's still in the house...<br> ...l'm not gonna bring Gloria<br> back here.<br> May I inquire why?<br> Gloria is a very sensitive<br> and well brought-up girl.<br> I don't want you flaunting<br> your new flames...<br> ...and old peccadilloes<br> in front of her.<br> Then why bring her here at all?<br> Want to know the truth?<br> I've been trying to avoid it.<br> She wanted to meet you.<br> I see.<br> You dropped by to see<br> that I was all...<br> ...scrubbed up and presentable<br> for inspection, is that it?<br> Yes.<br> And to tell you that<br> while she's here...<br> ...for five minutes to try to act<br> like a normal human being.<br> Gloria's from<br> a very conservative family.<br> She doesn't have to know<br> about things...<br> ...ordinary mortals<br> simply don't have to know about.<br> Should she know you've turned into<br> one of the most beastly, bourgeois...<br> ...Babbitty little snobs<br> on the Eastern seaboard?<br> Or will you be able to make that<br> quite clear without any help from me?<br> Well, it's been nice knowing you.<br> Patrick?<br> Auntie Mame?<br> Darling. I love you so.<br> I'd do anything for you. I'd denounce<br> Calvin Coolidge as a Bolshevik.<br> Gloria had better like you or<br> I'll bill her one square in the chops.<br> I'll get him out of here and have<br> the whole place fumigated. I promise.<br> Thanks, Auntie Mame.<br> Brian?<br> - Why aren't you dressed?<br> - Would you mind going without me?<br> - You want me to go alone?<br> - Something came up.<br> Hurry up and get dressed.<br> I am not going to that party alone.<br> If there's nothing more you wanted,<br> I just thought I'd go up to my room.<br> Agnes.<br> I wonder.<br> Is anything wrong, Mrs. Burnside?<br> - You're coming out.<br> - Where?<br> You know, you have<br> very beautiful eyes.<br> Take these glasses off forever.<br> I can't see out of my right eye.<br> Then look out of your left one.<br> Now, now, now, now.<br> You do have a bust!<br> Where have you been hiding that<br> all these months?<br> - What do you call those?<br> - Orthopedic Oxfords.<br> Kick them off. Now take<br> off your clothes. Norah, lto!<br> There's a man in the house.<br> Will you stop being a goose<br> and get these clothes off?<br> Norah? lto? Where are you<br> when I need you?<br> I don't have a very clear picture<br> of what's going on.<br> Now, Agnes, dear...<br> ...I am sending you to that party<br> tonight with Mr. O'Bannion.<br> I couldn't. I'm too nervous!<br> This will calm you down.<br> Oh, no! Spirits do<br> the most terrible things to me.<br> - I'm not the same girl.<br> - What's wrong with that?<br> Will it mix with Dr. Pepper?<br> He'll love it. Drink!<br> Norah, go get my black Patou velvet.<br> Ito, lay out my cosmetics,<br> my cold cream, everything.<br> You see, me be Charlie of the Ritz.<br> Come, child.<br> I think I know what you want me to do.<br> I'm not a bit sure I want to do it.<br> Agnes, where is your spine?<br> You've taken my dictation for weeks and<br> you don't get the message of my book.<br> - Live, that's the message.<br> - Live?<br> Yes! Life is a banquet and<br> most poor suckers are starving.<br> Now, come on, Agnes, live!<br> Come, child. Live!<br> The whole place has gone nuts.<br> She'll never make a silk purse<br> out of that sow's ear.<br> Mrs. Burnside, I can't breathe!<br> Good, good. If you can breathe,<br> it isn't tight enough.<br> - And why aren't you dressed?<br> - I am not going to that party tonight.<br> Then I'm not going either.<br> I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!<br> Well, you can use the Duesenberg.<br> And I have a date for you.<br> Agnes?<br> Agnes?! You can't expect...<br> Would you ask Toscanini<br> to lead a harmonica band?<br> I won't take Gooch,<br> she's an offense to the sight.<br> It's good her mother, the Countess<br> de Gooch, can't hear you.<br> She'd pull your beard.<br> Countess? You're joking.<br> Surely you've heard of the de Gooches?<br> Second wealthiest bankers.<br> Fabulous estate at Newport.<br> This child is just doing this<br> for a little literary experience.<br> Agnes. No, no, no.<br> Agnes, head up, dear.<br> Shoulders back. Tummy in.<br> Agnes, tonight you are<br> queen of Romania.<br> Agnes. On your feet.<br> Darling, you look divine.<br> - Do I really?<br> - Yes, now come along.<br> Enchanting.<br> Golly.<br> Hang those furs on the Gooch. Hurry.<br> Auntie Mame, Gloria Upson.<br> This is my Auntie Mame, Mrs. Burnside.<br> I can't tell you how pleased<br> I am to make your acquaintance.<br> Yes. Come in, children.<br> Do, please.<br> There's some friends<br> I'd like you to meet.<br> This is my secretary, Miss Gooch.<br> My Boswell, as it were.<br> Miss Upson and my nephew, Patrick.<br> What is your boyfriend's name?<br> O'Bannion. Mr. O'Bannion.<br> Well, now, you two run along<br> and have a good time.<br> Well, good night!<br> I can't tell you how pleased I am<br> to have met you, Mr. O'Bannion.<br> And Miss Boswell.<br> Well, Patrick tells me<br> how special you are to him.<br> That means you're very special<br> to me too.<br> - My, what a stunning apartment.<br> - Thank you.<br> Books are awfully decorative,<br> don't you think?<br> Won't you sit down?<br> - Can I get you something? A cognac?<br> - Another hot chocolate?<br> Not a thing. On our way to Bunny's,<br> my friend who lives on Park Avenue...<br> ...Patrick and I just stuffed<br> ourselves at Schrafft's.<br> Do you know what<br> your silly nephew did?<br> He spoke French to the counterman.<br> Imagine anybody speaking French<br> to a counterman at Schrafft's.<br> Showoff.<br> If nobody minds,<br> I think I'll have something.<br> You're at school, dear?<br> I'm an Upper Richmond<br> Girls' School girl.<br> How did you get that lovely tan<br> so early in spring?<br> I played hooky for a couple of weeks.<br> Mums and Daddums and I went<br> to our place in Fort Lauderdale.<br> I was out of my mind<br> until she got back.<br> I'm insanely jealous of this kid.<br> It's torture and I love it.<br> Silly.<br> Tell me, dear, have you<br> chosen your major yet?<br> Chosen my major?<br> What courses are you taking<br> at college?<br> Just a general sort of liberal arts<br> thing. English Lit and like that.<br> Upper Richmond's top drawer.<br> Really top drawer.<br> How did you two ever get acquainted?<br> Uncle Dwight introduced us.<br> Uncle Dwight? Oh, yes.<br> Well, he's not really my uncle.<br> But he's been a close friend<br> of the family since I was a girl...<br> ...with braces on my teeth.<br> One day I must meet Mums and Daddums.<br> We won't bother you with family stuff.<br> Naturally, we'll expect you<br> at the wedding.<br> The wedding?<br> Is there a wedding?<br> I told you it was definite,<br> Auntie Mame.<br> Well, it's awfully good of you<br> to let me know.<br> We've decided on a September wedding<br> at our place in Montebank.<br> September?<br> Tell me, just where is Montebank?<br> It's above Darien. You'll love it.<br> It's awfully pretty<br> and terribly handy to the city.<br> Of course, it's completely restricted.<br> I'll get a blood test.<br> We'd better hurry<br> to catch that Italian picture.<br> Those awful foreign movies.<br> What I go through for your nephew.<br> But he is kind of cute, isn't he?<br> Yes, isn't he?<br> I'm pleased to have made<br> your acquaintance.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> Well?

All that champagne,<br> I don't remember a thing.<br> I think we went to a movie.<br> Yeah, there was a wedding in it.<br> And Gary Cooper was the groom.<br> I don't remember who the girl was,<br> but it made me cry.<br> Where's Mrs. Burnside?<br> She get ready for Connecticut.<br> Where Duesenberg?<br> I don't know. Mr. O'Bannion said<br> he just had to meet my mother.<br> Then we got on the Staten Island Ferry<br> and he disappeared.<br> I've got to see Mrs. Burnside<br> before she goes.<br> Is anything wrong?<br> I did just what she told me. I lived.<br> I've gotta find out what to do now.<br> I think it's a very good match<br> for our little Gloria.<br> Why didn't Dwight want us<br> to meet the aunt?<br> We never would have<br> if she hadn't phoned.<br> I'm glad she did.<br> I've been dying to get a look at her.<br> - Where is she now?<br> - Freshening up in the guest room.<br> That certainly is an expensive outfit<br> she's wearing.<br> I looked at the label in her coat.<br> I'll bet she's better fixed<br> than Dwight figured.<br> I hope it's all right to have<br> a cocktail hour in the patio.<br> She may think we live like gypsies.<br> You show me a gypsy<br> that lives like we do.<br> Claude, you be genteel<br> in front of Mrs. Burnside.<br> That must be she.<br> We're out here on the patio,<br> Mrs. Burnside.<br> What a delightful spot you have here.<br> We adore Montebank.<br> Of course, we always spend summers<br> at our camp in the Adirondacks.<br> We call it Upson Pines.<br> We leave next week.<br> There's one thing we ought<br> to get straight right off.<br> You do take a little nip,<br> now and then?<br> On festive occasions.<br> Good!<br> I'll have an Upson daiquiri<br> ready in a minute.<br> I can't get over the thought you've<br> given every detail of your house.<br> We've done all we could to make it<br> seem like authentic Colonial America.<br> And how well you've succeeded.<br> Those enchanting miniatures in the<br> powder room of John Quincy Adams.<br> - Did you see our driveway signpost?<br> - I did.<br> What a divine name you've<br> given this place, Upson Downs.<br> - I'll bet you thought of that.<br> - That was Claude.<br> I'm just a homebody.<br> Claude is the clever one.<br> - Now, Mrs. Upson...<br> - Doris, dear.<br> Doris, dear.<br> Well, you must call me Mame.<br> Mamie.<br> Mame.<br> Well, Mamie old girl,<br> here's your poison.<br> I use a secret ingredient I learned<br> from a native in Havana, Cuba.<br> You'll never guess what<br> that secret ingredient is.<br> I'll say this much, there's no sugar<br> in a Claude Upson daiquiri.<br> And yet it's so sweet.<br> Whatever do you use?<br> Chocolate ice cream?<br> Say, that's rich!<br> Did you hear that, Doris?<br> Chocolate ice cream!<br> Since you're practically one of the<br> family, I'll let you in on my secret.<br> Honey.<br> I beg pardon?<br> Strained honey. That's the secret.<br> Of course, I use quite<br> a little rum too.<br> Now, Mamie, I've made these<br> especially for you, dear.<br> Oh, my! Don't they look delicious?<br> Well, well, well.<br> What are they?<br> I put two cans of tuna fish<br> through the meat grinder...<br> ...then add clam juice<br> and peanut butter.<br> It's a recipe from<br> Ladies' Home Journal.<br> These are plain Jack<br> cheese and chutney.<br> Now, sit you down, Mamie.<br> I've something special to show you.<br> Baby pictures of Gloria?<br> The whole family, more or less.<br> On a bear rug. Isn't that precious?<br> Better not let Patrick see that one.<br> That's Miss Tuttail,<br> Little Glory's first school teacher.<br> I think the light<br> was hurting her eyes.<br> Enough of this girly-girly talk.<br> Since we have Mamie here,<br> we ought to let her know the plans.<br> - Plans?<br> - For Patrick's career.<br> Dwight Babcock and I<br> have that coordinated.<br> After the honeymoon,<br> I want Patrick to choose.<br> I can slip him into a berth on Madison<br> Avenue or a seat on the stock exchange.<br> A seat and a berth...<br> Pardon me. I'm so sorry.<br> Mamie, you're a pretty fast drinker.<br> Don't worry, I'm way ahead of you.<br> - You don't happen to like gin, do you?<br> - I adore it.<br> After dinner,<br> we'll get out the cards and play.<br> Now we come to the problem of the<br> wedding present. I have that settled.<br> Now, here's my idea, Mamie:<br> Why don't you and I get together<br> and buy the newlyweds that?<br> - What?<br> - That lot, right next door.<br> Wouldn't that make a wedding present?<br> We could take out this wall<br> and join our patios.<br> You couldn't tell where one left off.<br> You wouldn't be losing a daughter.<br> You'd be gaining a patio.<br> We gotta work fast. There's<br> people bidding on that property.<br> The wrong kind.<br> A fellow named Epstein.<br> Abraham Epstein.<br> The cellist? How lucky you are.<br> All that glorious music next door!<br> And she's a darling.<br> I guess you don't understand<br> quite how it is here.<br> This section is restricted<br> only up to our property line.<br> We feel we have an obligation<br> to make sure...<br> Well, you know.<br> I'll tell you what. I'll buy it<br> and we'll divvy it up 50-50.<br> You won't have to worry about a thing.<br> My, my, my.<br> You've thought of everything,<br> haven't you?<br> Laid out Patrick's career.<br> Planned the wedding.<br> Even chosen my gift.<br> Well, I guess there's only<br> one thing left for me to do.<br> What's that?<br> When you get back from Prickly Pines,<br> I'll give an intimate family dinner.<br> Well, how about that?<br> Say, you're a good scout, Mamie.<br> By golly, you're top drawer!<br> Well, that's a very<br> interesting design...<br> ...but are you sure you planned it<br> with that end up?<br> That is the beauty of it, madam.<br> It can be used upside down.<br> Just leave it outside, please.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> You must be Patrick Dennis.<br> Guilty. Are you guilty of all of this?<br> I'm not the decorator. I'm your<br> aunt's secretary, Pegeen Ryan.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello.<br> I'm sorry, I didn't know.<br> I was away all summer.<br> A lot of changes here.<br> Leave it to Auntie Mame.<br> - Where'd she get this stuff?<br> - It's the only set in the universe.<br> It's made by the famous<br> Danish designer, Yul Uhlu.<br> Who?<br> Yul Uhlu.<br> Say that to the right fella<br> and you'll get kissed.<br> Incidentally, congratulations.<br> I hear you're getting married.<br> A week from next Tuesday.<br> The old ball and chain.<br> I wish I had said that. Or,<br> "The first 100 years are the hardest."<br> Good one. How about,<br> "Marriage is a great institution"?<br> "Yeah, but who wants<br> to be in an institution?"<br> Well, that's enough of that.<br> Patrick. Patrick, my little love!<br> I'm glad to see you. Did you have<br> a good time at Upson Pines?<br> I had a wonderful time.<br> What is the idea of...?<br> - Not now. I have to go to Montebank.<br> - They adored you but...<br> I'm so relieved. I want everything<br> to be extra special tonight...<br> ...and give the Upsons<br> as cozy a time as they gave me.<br> - Now, Pegeen, dear...<br> - I forgot the horror.<br> - Will someone help me with the ladder?<br> - Of course.<br> Fish food. Where's the fish food?<br> Oh, dear, dear, dear.<br> Don't nibble on the hors d'oeuvres.<br> You'll get fat.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Burnside.<br> I try to do exactly as you say.<br> Come and get it.<br> Come along, come along.<br> You're so wonderful.<br> Nobody else would've taken me in,<br> an outcast of society.<br> I'm grateful! You've given me a new<br> interest, now that I'm losing Patrick.<br> - I wish I had someone to look after.<br> - You will, dear, you will.<br> - Where do you want this set up?<br> - Right there will be fine.<br> - What's that supposed to be?<br> - You don't like it?<br> It might be a little avant-garde<br> for the Upsons.<br> Take it right down.<br> I want everything to be perfect.<br> - I think it's very unusual.<br> - Agnes! What is she doing here?<br> - Where else, in her condition?<br> - The Upsons will not understand.<br> - Perhaps they won't notice.<br> - Won't notice?<br> They're here. They're here.<br> - Help me get this down.<br> - Help her, darling.<br> - Leave it. Get the ladder out of here.<br> - Norah, lto, somebody answer the door!<br> - I'll get it.<br> - No, you don't!<br> - He's right. Go and stay in your room.<br> - But what will I do?<br> Sleep, knit, start making up names:<br> Rudolph, Abigail, Beulah, anything.<br> Welcome to the Burnside fireside.<br> How I have looked forward<br> to this evening! Come in.<br> - And Claude.<br> - Good to see you, Mamie!<br> - And little Glory.<br> - I'm so pleased to see you again.<br> Yes, dear.<br> Say!<br> My, my, my, my, my!<br> - Hi, everybody.<br> - Well, hello, son.<br> Patrick.<br> - Gloria.<br> - I made up a joke on the way up.<br> Listen to this:<br> Why is an elevator man's job<br> like my place in Connecticut?<br> - Give up?<br> - Almost.<br> I'll tell you. Because it has<br> its ups and down.<br> You get it? Upson Downs!<br> - Clever. Clever.<br> - Oh, well.<br> - Do sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> Doris, you're not comfortable.<br> These are all marvelously adjustable.<br> This is the master control.<br> Each chair has its cord.<br> Now, let me see, Doris.<br> You are number four. Now, here we go.<br> So sorry, Claude, you are number four.<br> Doris, you must be number five.<br> Patrick, you're confusing me.<br> Doris, here you are. Five, going up.<br> There we go.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> So easy to sweep under.<br> Claude, here we go. Hang on<br> to your seat belts. Down we go.<br> My, what supple legs you have.<br> You must have studied yoga.<br> Here are the drinks.<br> So sorry, Doris dear.<br> Going down to the main floor.<br> Cigars, cigarettes, lingerie, hardware.<br> Well, now, Patrick.<br> And little Glory.<br> And here's Uncle Dwight.<br> - Claude.<br> - Dwight!<br> Well, how are you?<br> - Mr. Babcock.<br> - Mrs. Burnside.<br> We must have that game of golf soon.<br> My, my, my, my, my.<br> We'll have to take that up a bit.<br> Pegeen, better bring the ladder again.<br> - Won't you sit down, Mr. Babcock?<br> - Thank you.<br> They're almost ready.<br> The spcialit de la maison.<br> - I want you to meet Miss Pegeen Ryan.<br> - How do you do?<br> Take it up. It seems to be<br> getting in peoples' hair.<br> - Claude.<br> - Thank you.<br> And Doris.<br> Claude, I'm not going to tell you<br> one thing that's in these drinks...<br> ...because all the ingredients<br> are secret.<br> Now, now, now, just hang on.<br> Well, what do you know?<br> The trick is to drink them up fast...<br> ...before all the alcohol burns away.<br> Don't you worry about a thing, Claude.<br> I'm fully covered by fire insurance.<br> Well, now, Patrick. Here.<br> And little Glory.<br> My friend who may drop in later<br> calls it the Flaming Mame.<br> - Who? Who is coming?<br> - Just family, darling.<br> Don't be a scaredy-cat.<br> There's nothing to be frightened of.<br> There, now.<br> Are we all lit?<br> - Mr. Upson, can I fix you a daiquiri?<br> - No. Not for a minute.<br> Your Aunt Mamie made this for me,<br> and I'm gonna drink it.<br> It looks just fine.<br> This is spicy.<br> Try one of the striped ones, Mums.<br> - These are tasty.<br> - What are they, dear?<br> Just plain old pickled rattlesnake.<br> Pure protein. They're marinated<br> after they remove the fangs.<br> Mr. Babcock, you've gone out.<br> Don't bother, Mrs. Burnside.<br> Agnes.<br> Agnes, I told you to stay<br> in your room.<br> But it's a quarter past 8,<br> and you told me...<br> I told you to take your pills<br> a quarter past 8.<br> - My calcium pills are in the kitchen.<br> - Now, now, come, dear.<br> - Is that a member of the family?<br> - Darned if I know.<br> It's a member of somebody's family.<br> I would like you to meet my former<br> secretary.

You have enough problems.<br> - Don't I, though?<br> That's a pretty picture, I must say.<br> Yes, isn't it? Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I want to propose a toast.<br> To this lovely young couple...<br> ...as they start up<br> the ladder of life together.<br> Oh, no, Auntie Vera.<br> This isn't Gloria. That's Gloria.<br> Pity.<br> - I brought you something.<br> - What is it?<br> - Be careful. The ink's wet.<br> - My book!<br> I'm in print. Just like Edna Ferber.<br> You did it. I never knew<br> you went on with it.<br> Patrick, you have vision.<br> Mame, he's just like you.<br> - My lifesaver, Patrick, and Lindsay.<br> - This has been a great day.<br> Patrick, why didn't you tell me<br> your aunt was literate?<br> - Am I mentioned in your book?<br> - Mentioned?

I was 10.<br> Here's all about the roller skates<br> and Uncle Beau.<br> And that Christmas we were so broke.<br> Patrick, my little Patrick.<br> You can practically write a whole book<br> about what happened to me.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I said, you can write a whole book<br> about what happened to me.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Yes.<br> Bunny Bixler and I were in the<br> semifinals, the very semifinals...<br> ...of the Ping-Pong tournament<br> at the club.<br> And this ghastly thing happened.<br> We were both playing way over<br> our heads and the score was 29-28.<br> We had this terrific volley...<br> ...and I stepped back<br> to get this really terrific shot.<br> And I stepped on the Ping-Pong ball.<br> I just squashed it to bits.<br> And then Bunny and I ran to the closet<br> to get another ball.<br> And the closet was locked. Imagine?<br> We had to call the whole thing off.<br> Well, it was ghastly.<br> Well, it was just ghastly.<br> - Well, it was amusing.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> It's hilarious!<br> - What is?<br> - Your story.<br> I'm so proud. The whole<br> last chapter's all about me.<br> "Fighting the stigma...<br> ...of the unwed mother."<br> Mr. Upson, you lucky devil.<br> Your future son-in-law is featured in<br> one of the raciest books of the year.<br> Patrick, I had no idea how many times<br> you unzipped me and put me to bed.<br> Now, just a minute!<br> There are young people here.<br> I only did it when Miss Charles<br> had passed out.<br> Thank you, lto.<br> - Don't tell me she can't come.<br> - Who can't come?<br> That woman with the snakes from Paris.<br> She was to entertain us.<br> Vera, loan me your glasses.<br> "Read a forthcoming publication<br> of our book.<br> I'm entitled to half of the royalties<br> for services as editor and co-author..."<br> Brian!<br> Brian?<br> "Will return in a few days<br> to claim fruits of collaboration.<br> My claim will be substantiated<br> by my wife, Agnes Gooch O'Bannion."<br> Wife?<br> - Think, Agnes, think.<br> - Think?<br> Try!<br> Maybe that wasn't a movie we went to.<br> Maybe that wasn't Gary Cooper.<br> It was Brian.<br> And the girl was...<br> ...me!<br> - I'm a bride!<br> - Oh, darling, congratulations.<br> Isn't it wonderful, Patrick?<br> - I'm so happy for you!<br> - Honey, isn't this terrific?<br> This is revolting.<br> How can you tolerate people who...?<br> Who aren't absolutely top drawer?<br> These are my friends.<br> People who brought me up.<br> Riffraff! When we're married,<br> don't invite such people to our house.<br> - Who'll be coming? Bunny, Muriel Puce?<br> - What's wrong with Muriel Puce?<br> She has the IQ of a dead battery.<br> As for your other girlfriends...<br> ...they're a lot of vain,<br> selfish, empty bigots.<br> Marvelous! You'll make<br> a fortune out of this book.<br> She will, but not for herself.<br> She gave her royalties<br> to the Epstein Home in Montebank.<br> - Epstein the cellist?<br> - What about Montebank?<br> Can't the Epsteins afford<br> their own home?<br> They're not going to live there.<br> They're building a home there<br> for refugee Jewish children.<br> - What's that?!<br> - Oh, no!<br> Jackpot!<br> Pegeen, call Denmark quick<br> and get ahold of Yul Uhlu!<br> Are you all right, Doris?<br> You ready?<br> I've been ready for quite some time.<br> Come, Glory!<br> You...!<br> Claude! Claude! Don't be hasty.<br> For 9 years, Mame Dennis Burnside,<br> I have done everything in my power...<br> ...to protect this boy from<br> your idiotic, cockeyed nincompoopery!<br> Now you've ruined everything.<br> All my plans for Patrick...!<br> Your plans!<br> You're shouting orders for everyone.<br> Did it occur to you<br> this boy might be hungry...<br> ...for something<br> you've never heard of?<br> When Patrick first walked<br> into my life...<br> ...a frightened little boy...<br> ...hanging on to Norah's hand...<br> ...it was love at first sight.<br> For 9 years I've tried<br> to open windows in his life.<br> You want to shut him up<br> in a safe deposit box.<br> I won't let you do that<br> to my little one.<br> Oh, no.<br> He's not little anymore.<br> And he's not mine.<br> But he's not yours, Mr. Babcock.<br> Patrick won't let you settle him down<br> in a restricted community...<br> ...make him an Aryan from Darien...<br> ...and marry him off to a girl<br> with braces on her brains.<br> Mame, did you deliberately<br> plan all this?<br> Don't be ridiculous. Patrick always<br> makes all his own decisions.<br> Rattlesnake, anyone?<br> Thank you...<br> ...Lady Iris.<br> Charmed...<br> ...Lord Dudley.<br> Punjab, India. June 28, 1946.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Dennis,<br> Dear Patrick and Pegeen:<br> Arriving from India, June 31.<br> Meet me Beekman Place apartment.<br> Must return India in two weeks...<br> ... when Uncle Lindsay will have<br> finished his course in yoga.<br> - What were you doing in there?<br> - Just giving Michael his presents.<br> Look, Dad. Which is the front?<br> Oh, my little love, let me help you.<br> There, now.<br> Salaam for your mother<br> like Auntie Mame just taught you.<br> Very good, sahib.<br> - That's not a real sword, is it?<br> - It's a scimitar.<br> That's what I always say.<br> In Hindustani it means, "The<br> water oxen are waiting at the gate."<br> My water oxen's waiting at Idlewild,<br> Pan American flight 100 for Karachi.<br> Michael, if I could only<br> show you India.<br> The color, the splendor, the mystery.<br> - The elephants in the street...<br> - Now, Auntie Mame.<br> I know, I know.<br> I shouldn't mention the possibility<br> of Michael going to India with me.<br> Auntie Mame said she'd love<br> to have me. She said so in there.<br> - That's ridiculous. I won't hear of it.<br> - Dad?<br> It's out of the question.<br> You heard your mother.<br> You know what your trouble is?<br> You don't live, live, live!<br> Life is a banquet and most poor<br> suckers are starving to death.<br> One thing you must remember:<br> School begins the day after Labor Day.<br> He must be back by then.<br> Naturally.<br> Of course.<br> Labor Day. That's sometime<br> in November, isn't it?<br> The first week in September,<br> Auntie Mame.<br> Labor. The problem of labor<br> in India is gargantuan.<br> What's "gargantuan," Auntie Mame?<br> On the plane, I'll give you<br> a pad and pencil...<br> ...to write down all the words<br> you don't understand.<br> I've been out shopping all morning<br> for your traveling gear.<br> Let's go upstairs and try things on.<br> Oh, Michael, I'm going<br> to open doors for you.<br> Doors you never even dreamed existed.<br> I give up. She's the pied piper.<br> Oh, what times we're going to have!<br> What vistas we're going<br> to explore together.<br> We'll spend a day at<br> an ancient Hindu temple.<br> The head monk is Auntie Mame's friend.<br> Perhaps he'll let you ring the bells<br> that bring the monks to prayer.<br> There, on the highest tower on a<br> clear day, you can see the Taj Mahal.<br> Beyond that is a beautiful...<br>
