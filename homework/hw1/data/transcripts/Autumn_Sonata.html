                        AUTUMN SONATA<br> Sometimes I watch my wife,<br> without her being aware of<br> my presence.<br> The first time she entered that room,<br> she said,<br> "It's good. I want to be here."<br> We'd met only a few days before,<br> at a bishops' council in Trondheim.<br> She was the correspondent<br> of a church magazine.<br> We met at lunch, and I told her about<br> the vicarage here.<br> I ventured to suggest we come here<br> after the conference.<br> On the way here, I asked her<br> if she would marry me.<br> She didn't reply.<br> But when we entered this room,<br> she turned to me and said,<br> "It's good. I want to be here."<br> Ever since then we've lived a good<br> and quiet life here at the vicarage.<br> Eva has told me about her life.<br> After school, she went to university.<br> She was engaged to a doctor,<br> and lived with him for several years.<br> She wrote two little books,<br> contracted tuberculosis,<br> broke off the engagement<br> and moved from Oslo to a small town<br> in the south of Norway,<br> where she started working<br> as a journalist.<br> This is the first of her books -<br> I'm very fond of it.<br> She writes,<br> "One has to learn to live;<br> I practise every day.<br> "The greatest obstacle<br> is that I don't know who I am.<br> "I fumble in the dark.<br> "Were someone to love me<br> for who I am,<br> "I might at last be able<br> to study myself.<br> "The possibility of this<br> is rather remote."<br> If I could only tell her one time<br> that she is loved,<br> unreservedly.<br> But I can't say it in such a way<br> that she will believe me.<br> I lack the proper words.<br> Can I read you my letter to Mother,<br> or am I disturbing you?<br> No, come in. Let me<br> switch off the radio.<br> I can come back later.<br> I would very much like<br> to hear your letter.<br> "Dearest Mother,<br> yesterday I ran into Agnes,<br> "who was visiting her parents<br> with her family.<br> "She told me Leonardo had died.<br> "Dearest little Mummy, I can imagine<br> how terrible you must feel.<br> "Would you like to visit us<br> for a few days, or weeks?<br> "Whichever suits you best.<br> "In case you get frightened<br> and say no directly,<br> "I must tell you the vicarage<br> is very spacious.<br> "You'll have your own room,<br> secluded and with all mod cons.<br> "We have a grand piano<br> for you to practise on.<br> "Wouldn't it be nice<br> not to have to stay at a hotel?<br> "Please say you'll come!<br> "We'll take good care of you<br> and spoil you.<br> "It's such a long time since we met.<br> In October it will be seven years.<br> "With love from Viktor<br> and your daughter Eva."<br> - That sounds very good.<br> - Do you think so?<br> - Mummy dearest! Welcome!<br> - Eva dear, here I am.<br> I'm so happy you're here.<br> Let me help you.<br> - What a long journey.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> The last bit is the worst.<br> But isn't it beautiful here.<br> - Will you stay for a while?<br> - I certainly will.<br> - How nice that you're here!<br> - And I want to see everything.<br> What heavy bags! Have you brought<br> all your music?<br> - Of course. I intend to move in.<br> - That would be lovely.<br> - You must give me some lessons.<br> - Of course.<br> - Where's Viktor?<br> - He's not here.<br> We didn't expect you so early.<br> He'll be back for lunch.<br> - This is your room.<br> - It's charming.<br> What a wonderful view.<br> Here's the bathroom.<br> Very attractive and modern.<br> - The closet, I hope it's big enough.<br> - I'm sure it is.<br> I'm really very tired.<br> My back aches. I sat with Leonardo<br> during his last 24 hours.<br> He was in terrible pain,<br> despite injections every two hours.<br> At times he cried.<br> It wasn't for fear of dying,<br> but out of pain.<br> There was building work going on<br> outside, drilling and hammering.<br> The sun was so hot, and there were<br> neither blinds nor awnings.<br> We tried to get another room, but<br> several wards were closed for repairs.<br> Towards the evening the noise<br> subsided and I opened the window.<br> The heat was like a wall outside -<br> it was windless.<br> The professor came at night,<br> an old friend of Leonardo's.<br> He said he didn't have long left.<br> Leonardo would have injections<br> once an hour,<br> so that he could fall asleep<br> without pain.<br> The professor left<br> and the nurse came in.<br> She thought I should eat,<br> but I wasn't hungry.<br> The smell made me nauseous.<br> Leonardo slept for a few minutes.<br> When he woke up, he asked me<br> to leave the room.<br> He called the nurse, who immediately<br> gave him an injection.<br> A few minutes later she came out.<br> She said that...<br> Leonardo was dead.<br> I stayed with him all night.<br> I thought about us having been friends<br> for 18 years, living together for 13.<br> Never a harsh or angry word<br> between us.<br> For the last two years<br> he knew he was hopelessly ill.<br> I went to see him in his villa<br> outside Naples as often as I could.<br> He was kind and considerate,<br> pleased by my success.<br> We would chat and joke,<br> play some chamber music.<br> He never mentioned his illness,<br> and I didn't ask.<br> He wouldn't have liked that.<br> One day he looked at me<br> for a long time.<br> Then he laughed and said,<br> "By this time next year,<br> I'll be gone,<br> "but I'll always be with you,<br> I'll always think of you."<br> It was nice of Leonardo to say that,<br> but then again he was a bit theatrical.<br> I can't really say I mourn him.<br> It feels empty, but one mustn't<br> bury oneself.<br> Have I changed much<br> since we last met?<br> - You're exactly the same.<br> - I dye my hair, of course.<br> Leonardo didn't want to see<br> my grey hairs.<br> I bought this trouser suit in Zrich,<br> for the car journey.<br> I spotted it in a window.<br> I went in and tried it on - perfect fit.<br> - Astonishingly cheap. Do you like it?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> Let's unpack. Give me a hand<br> with this suitcase, my back hurts so.<br> Can we find a board to put<br> under the mattress, for my back?<br> It's already there.<br> I put it there yesterday.<br> What's the matter, dear?<br> Are you crying?<br> - Have I said something wrong?<br> - It's because I'm so happy to see you.<br> Let's hug tightly,<br> as we did when you were little.<br> I only talk about myself.<br> Now you must tell, Eva dearest.<br> Let's sit down.<br> - How are you, little Eva?<br> - I'm very happy.<br> That's good. But isn't life here<br> very isolated?<br> - Viktor and I have our parish work.<br> - Yes, of course you do.<br> I often play in the church. Last month<br> I gave an evening recital.<br> I played, and then I talked about<br> the music. It was a great success.<br> - You will have to play for me.<br> - I'd love to.<br> I gave five school recitals<br> in Los Angeles.<br> Imagine, playing and talking<br> to three thousand children!<br> What a success - but awfully tiring.<br> There's something I have to tell you.<br> Helena is here.<br> You should have written and told me.<br> If I'd told you about Helena<br> you wouldn't have come.<br> - I'm sure I'd have come all the same.<br> - I'm sure you wouldn't.<br> Leonardo's death wasn't enough.<br> You had to drag poor Lena here, too?<br> Mother, Helena's lived here<br> for two years.<br> I wrote to tell you we were going<br> to ask her to come and live here.<br> - I wrote to you.<br> - I never received that letter.<br> Or you didn't bother to read it.<br> - Isn't that an unfair accusation?<br> - Yes, I'm sorry.<br> I can't bear to see her,<br> at least not today.<br> Mother, Helena is a wonderful person.<br> She's so looking forward<br> to seeing you.<br> She was so comfortable<br> in the nursing home.<br> I wanted to have her here.<br> - Are you sure she's better off here?<br> - Yes, she is.<br> And I have someone to care for.<br> Has she... I mean, has she...<br> Is she... worse?<br> Yes, of course she's worse.<br> It's part of the illness.<br> Then let's go and see her.<br> - Are you sure you want to?<br> - Do I have a choice?<br> I've never had a taste for people<br> who are unaware of their motives.<br> - Do you mean me?<br> - Take it the way you like. Come on.<br> My dearest Lena.<br> I've thought of you so often,<br> every day.<br> She's got a cold. She's afraid<br> she'll give it to you.<br> I'm not afraid - I haven't had a cold<br> for twenty years!<br> What a lovely room you have. And the<br> view is the same as from my room.<br> Helena wants you to hold her head<br> and look at her.<br> - Like this? Is this good?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm so glad Eva's taking care of you.<br> I thought you were still at the home.<br> I was going to come and see you<br> before I left. But this is much better.<br> - We can be together every day.<br> - Yes.<br> Are you in pain?<br> No.<br> Your hair looks lovely.<br> It's in your honour, Mummy.<br> If you want, I could read to you.<br> Would you like that?<br> And we could go out in the car.<br> I've never been to these parts.<br> - What is she saying?<br> - You must be tired.<br> You needn't exert yourself<br> further today.<br> Mummy's been very good.<br> - Doesn't Lena have a clock?<br> - Yes, on the bedside table.<br> Have my watch.<br> I was given it by an admirer<br> who thought I was always late.<br> - Will Lena eat dinner with us?<br> - No, lunch is her main meal.<br> Anyway, Lena is on a diet.<br> She ate too much at the home.<br> Why do I feel feverish?<br> Why do I want to cry?<br> How stupid! There I stand - shamed.<br> And that's the idea.<br> And the guilty conscience,<br> always the guilty conscience!<br> I was in such a hurry to come here.<br> What did I expect?<br> What was it I longed for,<br> that I didn't dare admit to myself?<br> This inconceivably peculiar mother!<br> You should have seen her<br> when I told her that Helena lived here.<br> She even managed a smile,<br> despite her surprise and dismay.<br> And then, outside Lena's door,<br> the actress before her entrance.<br> Awfully frightened - but composed.<br> An outstanding performance.<br> Why did she come?<br> What did she expect from a reunion<br> after seven years?<br> - Who knows?<br> - What did I expect?<br> Do we never give up hope?<br> Never stop being mother and daughter?<br> No point in crying.<br> Damn!<br> There she was, looking at me<br> with her big eyes.<br> I held her face in my hands<br> and I could feel<br> the illness tugging at<br> her neck muscles.<br> Damn!<br> Why can't I hold her and comfort her,<br> like I did when she was little?<br> That ravaged, soft body,<br> that's my Lena.<br> Don't cry, damn it!<br> A writer - I forget the name - said,<br> "It's like a heavy ghost that falls over<br> you when you open the nursery door,<br> "because you've long ago forgotten<br> it's the nursery door."<br> Do you think I'm adult?<br> To be an adult is to be able to deal<br> with one's dreams and expectations.<br> - One has stopped yearning.<br> - Do you think so?<br> Perhaps one ceases to be surprised.<br> You look so sensible, sitting there<br> with your old pipe.<br> - You're altogether adult.<br> - Hardly. I'm surprised every day.<br> - At what?<br> - At you, for example.<br> Besides, I nurture some unreasonable<br> dreams and expectations,<br> as well as a kind of yearning.<br> - Yearning?<br> - I yearn for you.<br> Those are pretty words, aren't they?<br> Words that don't mean anything real.<br> I was brought up on pretty words.<br> Mother is never mad,<br> or disappointed or unhappy.<br> She "feels pain".<br> You use words like that, too.<br> I suppose it comes with the job.<br> When you say you yearn for me<br> when I'm right here, I get wary.<br> - You know very well what I mean.<br> - No.<br> If I knew that, you wouldn't<br> think of saying you yearn for me.<br> I have to check on the roast.<br> Mother thinks I'm a poor cook.<br> She's a real glutton.<br> - I think you're...<br> - .. a wonderful cook. Thank you.<br> I mustn't forget she wants<br> decaffeinated coffee.<br> I'll shorten my stay.<br> Four days - I could make that.<br> Then I'll go to Africa, as I planned.<br> This hurts, Charlotte.<br> Hurts.<br> Viktor, I've often wondered why she<br> suffers from insomnia. I think I know.<br> If she slept normally, her vitality<br> would crush those around her.<br> Insomnia is nature's way<br> of making her bearable.<br> I'll wear my red dress.<br> And I'm doing it out of sheer spite.<br> Eva will think I should wear something<br> more seemly after Leonardo's death.<br> Viktor, she will have dressed up<br> for dinner, you'll see.<br> Note the perfect clothes<br> which discreetly will remind us<br> that she's in mourning, after all.<br> All this anger.<br> All they've done is show<br> how happy they are to have me.<br> Viktor's a kind soul. Lucky for Eva,<br> the crybaby, to have such a good man.<br> I bet the shower's not working.<br> It is.<br> - What a beautiful dress!<br> - Does it suit me?<br> I met my old 'girlfriend',<br> Samuel Parkenhurst, and he said,<br> "I've just come from a fashion show,<br> there's a red dress that's so you."<br> Let's have a toast. Welcome to<br> the vicarage, dear Charlotte.<br> Eva, are my glasses on the table<br> by the window?<br> Thank you, darling.<br> My agent - he's so sweet.<br> He's my only friend these days.<br> Do you remember Paul, Eva?<br> We've worked together for 30 years.<br> What a lovely old instrument!<br> Such a beautiful timbre!<br> And it's newly tuned.<br> Now I'm happy!<br> - I worried unnecessarily.<br> - What do you mean?<br> I was anxious about seeing you<br> after all this time. I nearly cancelled.<br> No sugar, thanks.<br> This coffee isn't much fun,<br> but what to do when one can't sleep?<br> I see you're playing<br> the Chopin Preludes.<br> - Won't you play for me?<br> - Not now, Mother.<br> Don't be childish. It would give me<br> great pleasure to hear you play.<br> You told me you were hoping<br> your mother would listen to you.<br> I just dabble at it, I lack all technique.<br> I haven't even learnt the fingering<br> of this prelude. I couldn't...<br> Enough excuses, darling. Get to it!<br> My dearest little Eva.<br> - Is that all you have to say?<br> - No, no, I was just so moved.<br> - Did you like it?<br> - I liked you.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - Play something else, it's lovely.<br> - I want to know about my mistakes.<br> - There weren't any.<br> You didn't like the way<br> I played the piece.<br> - We all have our own opinion.<br> - Right.<br> - I want to hear yours.<br> - You're already cross.<br> I'm sad that you don't find it<br> worthwhile to give me your opinion.<br> If you insist.<br> We'll disregard your technique,<br> which wasn't so bad,<br> though you could have paid more<br> attention to Cortot's fingering,<br> as it helps the interpretation. But we're<br> only talking about the conception.<br> Chopin was emotional, Eva,<br> not sentimental.<br> There is a chasm between emotion<br> and sentimentality.<br> The prelude you played speaks of<br> suppressed emotion, not reveries.<br> You have to be calm,<br> clear and austere.<br> Take the first few bars...<br> It hurts, but he's not showing it.<br> Then - brief relief.<br> But almost instantly it fades away<br> and the pain remains the same,<br> not greater, not lesser.<br> A constant and complete restraint.<br> Chopin was proud, sarcastic,<br> impetuous, tormented<br> and very manly.<br> He was no sentimental old woman.<br> This prelude must be played<br> in an almost ugly manner.<br> It mustn't be seductive,<br> it should sound wrong.<br> Laboured, or successfully negotiated.<br> Like this, I'll show you.<br> I see.<br> - Don't be upset, Eva.<br> - I'm not upset. On the contrary.<br> I've worked on these preludes<br> for forty-five years.<br> Many secrets still remain,<br> things I do not understand.<br> As a child I admired you terribly.<br> Then I was fed up with you<br> and your pianos for many years.<br> Now I'm beginning to admire you<br> again, in a different way.<br> - Then there's hope.<br> - I suppose so.<br> - Eva, where are you?<br> - I'm upstairs, Mother!<br> There you are. I've changed<br> so that we can go for a walk.<br> - Isn't this the nursery?<br> - Yes, it's Erik's room.<br> You've just left it like this?<br> Viktor and I often talk of redecorating,<br> but we don't get round to it.<br> Sometimes I come here<br> to sit and think.<br> - Let's go out now.<br> - Wait.<br> Do you feel how peaceful it is here?<br> Erik died the day before his fourth<br> birthday... but you know that.<br> Viktor couldn't handle it - Erik and he<br> had a special bond.<br> Outwardly, I grieved for him a lot,<br> but deep down inside<br> I feel he is still alive,<br> that we are still close to each other.<br> I only have to concentrate a little<br> and he's right there.<br> Sometimes, when I'm going to sleep,<br> I can feel his breath on my face.<br> Then he touches me with his hand.<br> He's in his world, but we can<br> reach each other any time.<br> There is no boundary,<br> no insurmountable wall.<br> At times I wonder what the reality is like<br> where my boy lives and breathes.<br> At the same time<br> I know it can't be described,<br> as it's a world of liberated emotions.<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> To me, man is<br> an unparalleled creation,<br> like an unfathomable thought.<br> Everything exists in man,<br> from the highest to the lowest.<br> Man is created in God's own image,<br> and everything exists in God.<br> And so man is created,<br> but also the demons and the saints,<br> the prophets and the artists,<br> and all those who destroy.<br> Everything coexists, grows together.<br> Enormous patterns that constantly<br> change. Do you see what I mean?<br> In the same way, a limitless number<br> of realities must exist,<br> not only the reality we can grasp<br> with our blunt senses,<br> but a tumult of realities that arch<br> over and around, inside and outside.<br> Only fear and sententiousness<br> confine us.<br> There are no boundaries.<br> Not for our thoughts.<br> Not for our emotions.<br> It's anxiety that sets boundaries,<br> don't you think?<br> During the slow movement of<br> Beethoven's 'Hammerklavier' sonata,<br> you must feel you're living in a world<br> without boundaries,<br> in a movement you could never<br> explore or penetrate.<br> Let's go for a walk<br> before it gets too dark.<br> I thought I heard Helena call.<br> Forgive me.<br> Viktor, I think Eva is terribly unhappy.<br> I'm dismayed by the way she talks.<br> She's so highly strung.<br> Just a moment, my dear Charlotte,<br> and I will try to explain<br> how I view my wife.<br> When I asked her to marry me, she<br> immediately said she didn't love me.<br> - What are you saying?<br> - I asked, did she love someone else?<br> She replied that she had<br> never loved another person,<br> that she was incapable of loving.<br> Eva and I lived here for several years.<br> Then Erik was born.<br> We'd given up hope of having a child<br> and were talking about adopting.<br> You see, during her pregnancy,<br> Eva underwent<br> a complete transformation.<br> She became happy,<br> soft and gregarious.<br> She grew lazy,<br> ignoring the parish work<br> and her piano playing.<br> She'd sit and watch the light travel<br> across the mountains and the fjord.<br> We were suddenly very happy.<br> I'm quite a lot older than Eva,<br> and I had begun to feel that a grey film<br> was enveloping my existence.<br> I felt as though I could look back<br> and say,<br> "Oh, so this is life, this is what<br> it's going to be like."<br> But then,<br> everything was different.<br> You'll have to forgive me, Charlotte.<br> I still find it hard to...<br> A few very rich years went by.<br> Erik.<br> You should have seen Eva.<br> Really seen her.<br> I remember the time<br> around Erik's birth.<br> I was recording all the Mozart sonatas<br> and concertos. I was so busy.<br> Right. We repeatedly invited you,<br> but sadly you could never make it.<br> No.<br> When Erik drowned,<br> the film became even greyer.<br> But for Eva it was different.<br> - Different? In what way?<br> - Her feeling is alive.<br> Unspoilt.<br> At least that's how it seems.<br> And Charlotte,<br> if she feels that her son lives near her,<br> then perhaps that's how it is.<br> She seldom talks about it,<br> for fear it will hurt me,<br> and I suppose it does.<br> But what she says sounds true.<br> I believe her.<br> Of course, you're a man of God.<br> The little faith I have<br> exists on her terms.<br> - Forgive me if I hurt you.<br> - That's all right, dear.<br> Unlike you and Eva, I'm vague<br> and insecure. It's my own fault.<br> I think I'll feast on<br> a couple of proper sleeping pills.<br> It's so peaceful here,<br> just the rain on the roof.<br> - Do you have everything?<br> - Everything is perfect.<br> The right biscuits, mineral water,<br> a tape recorder, two detective novels,<br> my mask and earplugs, my little<br> extra pillow and my travelling rug.<br> Have some Swiss chocolate,<br> fresh from Zrich. Take two.<br> - Thanks, but I don't like chocolate.<br> - How strange.<br> You were crazy about sweets<br> as a child.<br> - Helena liked sweets, not me.<br> - All the better then, it's all for me.<br> - Good night, Mummy.<br> - Good night, dear child.<br> Viktor really is charming.<br> - You must take good care of him.<br> - I do.<br> Tell me, my dear,<br> are you happy together?<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Viktor is my best friend.<br> I don't know what life would be like<br> without him.<br> - He said you didn't love him.<br> - He told you that?<br> - Yes. Why?<br> - It's a bit surprising, that's all.<br> - Was it a secret?<br> - No.<br> - You don't like him saying it?<br> - Viktor seldom confides in people.<br> We were talking about you.<br> Ask me directly. I will answer<br> as honestly as I can.<br> Don't blow this up.<br> Is it so strange if a mother<br> is curious about her daughter?<br> We talked about you<br> with the utmost affection.<br> Why can't you leave people alone?<br> - I've left you alone far too long!<br> - That's true.<br> Give me a hug and promise me<br> you're not cross.<br> - I'm not cross.<br> - It's because I love you.<br> I love you, too.<br> It's not that much fun<br> being alone all the time.<br> I'm envious of you and Viktor.<br> And now, with Leonardo dead,<br> I'm so terribly lonely.<br> - You must see that.<br> - I do.<br> No, no, I'll soon start crying<br> out of self-pity.<br> This detective novel is not bad.<br> It's a new writer, Adam Kretzinsky.<br> Heard of him?<br> I met him in Madrid. He's quite mad.<br> I couldn't defend myself.<br> That is, I didn't defend myself at all.<br> - Should I turn this light out?<br> - Yes, please do.<br> - Tell me when you want breakfast.<br> - Don't bother.<br> - But I want to spoil you.<br> - Well, if you insist.<br> Strong coffee with hot milk, two slices<br> of rye bread with Jarlsberg cheese,<br> and one slice of toast with honey.<br> Right?<br> - And orange juice.<br> - I nearly forgot.<br> - You'll get your juice.<br> - Bye, little darling. Good night.<br> Good night, dear Mother.<br> Maybe I should have a look at<br> my accounts.<br> I mustn't forget to have Brammer<br> invest the money from Leonardo.<br> The house is worth quite a lot.<br> Yes, Leonardo, you didn't bother with<br> assets and liabilities.<br> You were beyond worldly worries.<br> You left all your problems<br> to your Charlotte.<br> Three million, seven hundred<br> and thirty-five thousand,<br> eight hundred and sixty-six francs.<br> To think you had all that money,<br> Leonardo. Who would have guessed?<br> And you left everything<br> to your old Charlotte.<br> I also have a penny or two.<br> That makes nearly five million in all.<br> What do I want with all that money?<br> That's it - I'll buy a nice car<br> for Viktor and Eva!<br> They can't keep their old banger -<br> it looks lethal.<br> We'll go into town on Monday<br> and look for a new car.<br> That will cheer them up,<br> and me, too.<br> "She gave him the red flower of her<br> innocence with quiet dignity.<br> "He received it without enthusiasm."<br> What trash!<br> He really was quite an idiot,<br> that Adam.<br> Even if he nearly killed himself<br> for my sake.<br> What if I buy myself a new car, and<br> give the Mercedes to Viktor and Eva?<br> Then I could fly to Paris<br> and buy a new car there.<br> Then I won't have to drive<br> all the way there.<br> Tomorrow I must<br> set about Ravel properly.<br> Christ, I've been lazy lately.<br> It's inexcusable, really.<br> Mother, dear, what's happened?<br> I heard your cry, but then I couldn't<br> find you in your room.<br> I'm sorry if I woke you up, but I had<br> a nightmare. I dreamt that...<br> No, I don't remember.<br> - I'll stay if you want to talk.<br> - No, thank you, dear.<br> - I'll just sit here for a while. Go to bed.<br> - If you say so.<br> - Eva!<br> - Yes, Mother?<br> - You do like me, don't you?<br> - You're my mother.<br> What an answer.<br> - Do you like me?<br> - But I love you!<br> That's not true.<br> I took a break in my career<br> to stay at home with you and Father.<br> Your back injury made it impossible<br> for you to practise six hours a day,<br> so your playing deteriorated<br> and your reviews got poorer.<br> Really, Eva!<br> I don't know what was worse - you<br> playing at being a wife and a mother,<br> or you being on tour.<br> You made life hell<br> for both Father and me.<br> It's not true. Your father and l<br> were very happy.<br> Josef loved me, and I'd have done<br> anything for him.<br> Of course - you cheated on him.<br> I did not cheat on him!<br> I was totally honest with your father.<br> I fell in love with Martin and<br> went away with him for eight months.<br> Do you think it was so easy?<br> It was I who sat with Father in the<br> evenings, I who had to comfort him.<br> I had to tell him<br> that you still loved him,<br> and that you would surely come back.<br> I had to read your letters aloud.<br> Your long, affectionate, funny letters,<br> in which you told of<br> your interesting journeys.<br> We sat there, like two idiots,<br> reading your letters twice, three times.<br> We thought you were<br> the most wonderful woman alive.<br> Eva, you hate me.<br> I don't know.<br> Suddenly you're coming here,<br> and I'm so happy.<br> I don't know what I was imagining.<br> Maybe that you were sad and lonely.<br> I don't know, I'm so confused!<br> I thought I was adult, that I had<br> a clear picture of you and me,<br> of Helena's illness and our childhood.<br> Now I realise it's utterly chaotic.<br> It's Helena.<br> There, there. Wake up a little.<br> Wake up.<br> I'll sit here while you go back to sleep.<br> To you I was a doll to play with<br> when you had the time.<br> If I was ill or difficult, you'd<br> hand me over to the nanny.<br> You'd shut yourself up in your work,<br> no one was allowed to disturb you.<br> I would stand outside and listen.<br> I'd sneak in during your coffee break<br> to make sure you existed.<br> You were always kind...<br> but completely preoccupied.<br> If I asked you something,<br> I'd barely get a reply.<br> Mummy would like to be alone.<br> Why don't you go out and play?<br> Because you were so elegant,<br> I wanted to be elegant, too.<br> I became fussy about my clothes.<br> I worried that you wouldn't like<br> my appearance.<br> I was ugly.<br> Skinny and angular,<br> with big, round eyes and fat lips.<br> No eyebrows.<br> My arms were too thin and my feet<br> too big. I thought I looked disgusting.<br> Once you said,<br> "You should have been a boy."<br> Then you laughed, so I wouldn't<br> be upset. But I was, of course.<br> One day, your suitcases<br> stood at the foot of the stairs.<br> You were talking on the phone,<br> in a foreign language.<br> I prayed to God something would<br> happen to stop you going away.<br> But you always went.<br> You came up to me,<br> hugged and kissed me.<br> Embraced me and kissed me again.<br> You looked at me and smiled.<br> You smelt so good, so strange.<br> But you were a stranger to me.<br> You were already on your way,<br> you didn't see me.<br> And so you were gone.<br> I thought, "Now my heart will stop.<br> I'm going to die from the pain.<br> "I'll never be happy again.<br> "How could I endure<br> this pain for two months?"<br> I would cry on Father's lap.<br> He would sit motionless,<br> his soft little hand on my head.<br> He'd sit there for hours, smoking his<br> old pipe, enveloping us with smoke.<br> Sometimes he'd speak.<br> "Shall we go to the cinema tonight?"<br> Or, "Let's have ice cream<br> for dinner today."<br> I didn't care about either,<br> because I was dying.<br> The days and weeks went by.<br> We negotiated the loneliness.<br> We didn't have much to talk about.<br> It was easy with Father -<br> he was never disturbed.<br> At times he'd look worried. I didn't<br> know that he had financial difficulties.<br> But he always lit up<br> when I came clumping in.<br> We'd have a little chat, or he'd just<br> pat me with his pale little hand.<br> Or Uncle Otto would sit on the sofa,<br> drinking cognac.<br> They would mutter quietly.<br> I wonder if they actually heard<br> each other.<br> Or Uncle Harry would be there,<br> playing chess.<br> It would be extra quiet then.<br> You could hear three different clocks<br> ticking in the house.<br> Several days before your return,<br> I'd be feverish with excitement.<br> At the same time,<br> I feared falling ill for real,<br> as I knew you were afraid of<br> sick people.<br> When you came, my joy<br> was more than I could stand.<br> I couldn't speak. Sometimes you<br> would become impatient and say,<br> "Eva doesn't seem very happy<br> to have her mother back home."<br> Then I'd turn crimson,<br> and all sweaty.<br> I couldn't speak.<br> I didn't have any words.<br> You'd taken care of all the words<br> in our house.<br> - You exaggerate, Eva.<br> - Let me finish.<br> I know I'm a little drunk. But if I wasn't,<br> I wouldn't be saying this.<br> When I daren't say more, or fall silent<br> from shame, then you can explain.<br> I shall listen and understand, the way<br> I've always listened and understood.<br> I loved you, Mummy.<br> It was a matter of life or death,<br> but I didn't trust your words.<br> They didn't agree with<br> the look in your eyes.<br> Your voice is beautiful. I could feel it<br> in my whole body when you spoke,<br> but I knew instinctively that you<br> hardly ever meant what you said.<br> I didn't understand your words.<br> The worst part was that you smiled<br> when you were angry.<br> When you hated Father,<br> you called him "my dearest friend".<br> When you were fed up with me,<br> I was "my darling girl".<br> You're very quiet.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> You could defend yourself.<br> - Is it worth it?<br> - How would I know that?<br> You reproach me for going away,<br> you reproach me for staying at home.<br> You've probably never realised<br> that those years were hell for me.<br> My back hurt, I couldn't practise and<br> my recitals suffered.<br> lmportant contracts were cancelled.<br> My life felt meaningless.<br> But I always had a guilty conscience<br> for not being at home.<br> You smile ironically!<br> I'm trying to be honest.<br> I'll tell you how I reasoned -<br> and I don't care what you think.<br> Let's have it out this once,<br> and never again.<br> I'm trying to understand.<br> It was in Hamburg. I played<br> Beethoven's first,<br> which isn't so difficult,<br> and everything went well.<br> After the concert, I went out with<br> old Schmiess, the conductor,<br> for a bite to eat - we always did.<br> When we'd lingered over dinner,<br> I was very happy,<br> I could hardly feel my backache.<br> Then old Schmiess said,<br> "Why don't you stay at home<br> with your family<br> "and live a respectable life,<br> "rather than suffer<br> constant humiliation?"<br> I stared at him,<br> then I gave a laugh and said,<br> "Was I that bad?"<br> "No, not that bad," he said.<br> "But I can't help thinking of<br> August 18, 1934.<br> "We did Beethoven's first together,<br> in Linz.<br> "You were twenty,<br> and the hall was packed.<br> "We played like gods,<br> the orchestra was on fire.<br> "Afterwards, people were screaming<br> and stamping their feet.<br> "The musicians showed<br> their appreciation.<br> "You were wearing<br> a simple red summer dress,<br> "with your hair down to your waist."<br> "How can you remember all this?"<br> I asked.<br> "I have it written down in my score,"<br> he said.<br> "I note down all my greatest<br> experiences."<br> That night I couldn't fall asleep.<br> At 3am I called your father and told<br> him that I'd decided to stop touring.<br> I was going to stay at home,<br> we would be a real family.<br> Josef was so terribly happy.<br> We both cried with emotion.<br> We spoke for two hours.<br> That's that. And that summer<br> we were...<br> We were happy then, weren't we?<br> No.<br> - You weren't happy?<br> - No.<br> You said you'd never been happier.<br> Yes. I didn't want to hurt you.<br> Oh, so that's how it was?<br> - What did I do wrong?<br> - I was fourteen.<br> For want of anything better, you<br> turned all your pent-up energy on me.<br> You felt you had neglected me,<br> and were going to make up for it.<br> I tried to defend myself,<br> but I didn't stand a chance.<br> There you were, with your tender care<br> and concern in your voice.<br> Not a single detail escaped<br> your loving attention.<br> I had a stoop,<br> so you set me exercises.<br> You exercised with me,<br> pleading your back as an excuse.<br> You thought I had too much bother<br> with my long hair, and cut it short.<br> It was horrible.<br> You decided my teeth were crooked,<br> so I had to wear braces.<br> I looked grotesque!<br> You said I was too old<br> for my trousers and skirts,<br> and had dresses made for me,<br> without asking my opinion!<br> And I didn't dare say anything,<br> for fear of hurting you.<br> You gave me books to read<br> that I didn't understand.<br> I read and I read, and then you and l<br> were to discuss what I had read.<br> You talked and talked,<br> but I didn't understand a thing!<br> I only worried about having my<br> ignorance exposed. I was paralysed.<br> One thing I learnt, though.<br> Not one molecule of the real me<br> could be loved, or even accepted.<br> You were obsessed, and I became<br> more and more scared and crushed.<br> I said what you wanted to hear,<br> made your gestures.<br> I wasn't even myself<br> when I was on my own,<br> as I abhorred everything<br> that was my own!<br> It was horrendous, Mother!<br> I still shake all over<br> when I think of those years.<br> It was horrible!<br> I didn't understand that I hated you -<br> I was convinced we loved each other.<br> I couldn't hate you, so my hatred<br> turned into a terrible anxiety.<br> I had nightmares, I bit my nails,<br> I pulled out chunks of my hair.<br> I wanted to cry, but I couldn't -<br> I couldn't utter a single sound.<br> I tried to scream, but only<br> stifled grunts came out,<br> which scared me even more,<br> as I thought I was going insane!<br> - Then I met Stefan.<br> - You couldn't have had a child!<br> I was eighteen, Stefan was grown-up!<br> We'd have coped.<br> - You wouldn't have coped!<br> - We would have!<br> We wanted the child, but you ruined<br> our relationship.<br> It's not true! I even said to Josef<br> that we had to show consideration.<br> You didn't see that Stefan was an idiot!<br> Do you know everything?<br> Did you hear me and Stefan talk?<br> Did you lie under our bed? Do you<br> know what you're talking about at all?<br> Have you ever cared about<br> anybody else but yourself?<br> I couldn't have forced<br> an abortion on you.<br> How could I stand up to you?<br> I was scared and insecure.<br> - I needed support.<br> - I tried to help you.<br> I was convinced an abortion was the<br> only solution. I have been until now.<br> All these years of hatred.<br> Why didn't you say something?<br> Because you never listen.<br> Because you run away from things.<br> Because you're emotionally crippled.<br> Because you actually loathe me<br> and Helena.<br> You're helplessly locked up inside<br> yourself, holding yourself back.<br> Because I loved you.<br> Because you thought I was a failure,<br> disgusting and untalented.<br> You damaged me for life,<br> just as you yourself are damaged.<br> You went for everything<br> sensitive and fragile.<br> You tried to stifle<br> every living thing you could get at.<br> You speak of my hatred.<br> Your hatred wasn't any less strong.<br> Your hatred isn't any less strong.<br> I was small and malleable<br> and loving.<br> You tied me down<br> because you needed my love,<br> just as you want everyone<br> to love you.<br> I was exposed and defenceless.<br> And it all took place<br> in the name of love.<br> You kept on saying you loved me,<br> and Father and Helena.<br> And you knew the intonation<br> and gestures of love.<br> People like you are lethal -<br> you should be locked up<br> and made harmless.<br> A mother and her daughter.<br> What a terrible combination...<br> of emotions and confusion...<br> and destruction.<br> Everything's possible and will be done<br> in the name of love and caring.<br> The daughter shall inherit<br> the mother's injuries.<br> The daughter shall suffer for<br> the mother's failures.<br> The unhappiness of the mother<br> shall be the daughter's unhappiness.<br> It's as if the umbilical cord<br> had never been cut.<br> Mummy...<br> is that how it is?<br> Is the daughter's unhappiness<br> the mother's triumph?<br> Mummy...<br> is my grief...<br> your secret pleasure?<br> Christ, my back hurts.<br> Do you mind if I lie on the floor?<br> It's the only thing that helps.<br> I remember very little<br> from my childhood.<br> I can't recall either of my parents<br> ever touching me,<br> either to caress or punish.<br> I was completely ignorant of anything<br> to do with love,<br> affection, touching, intimacy, warmth.<br> Only through music did I get a chance<br> to reveal my emotions.<br> Sometimes when I lie awake at night,<br> I wonder whether I've lived at all.<br> And I wonder whether it's the same<br> for all people,<br> or if some people have a greater<br> talent for living than others.<br> Or if some people never live,<br> but simply exist.<br> Then I'm seized with...<br> I'm seized with anxiety.<br> I see an ugly picture of myself...<br> I've never grown up.<br> My face and my body have aged.<br> I'm accumulating memories<br> and experiences.<br> But inside all of this,<br> I haven't even been born.<br> I don't remember any faces,<br> not even my own.<br> Sometimes I try to remember<br> Mother's face,<br> but I can't see her.<br> I can remember that she was big<br> and dark, with blue eyes,<br> a large nose and a full mouth.<br> But I can't seem to get<br> the different pieces to agree.<br> I can't see her.<br> In the same way, I can't see your<br> face, or Helena's or Leonardo's.<br> I remember having given birth<br> to you and your sister,<br> but all I remember of the deliveries<br> themselves is that they were painful.<br> But the pain, what did it taste like?<br> I don't remember.<br> Leonardo once said...<br> No, I can't remember...<br> Yes. "Having a sense of reality<br> is a matter of talent," he said.<br> "Most people lack this talent,<br> "and maybe just as well."<br> - Do you understand what he meant?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - But it's really too peculiar.<br> - Peculiar?<br> - I've always been afraid of you.<br> - I don't see why.<br> I think I wanted you<br> to take care of me,<br> take me in your arms and comfort me.<br> I was a child.<br> - Does that matter?<br> - No.<br> I could see that you loved me.<br> And I wanted to love you,<br> but I couldn't. I was afraid of<br> your demands.<br> - I had no demands.<br> - But I thought you did.<br> I didn't want to be your mother.<br> I wanted you to know<br> that I was as helpless as you.<br> Is it true?<br> - What are you thinking about?<br> - About Leonardo and Helena.<br> I don't understand.<br> They hardly knew one another.<br> - We spent Easter together once.<br> - You left after three days.<br> I was playing Bartk with Ansermet<br> in Geneva.<br> I wanted to go through the concerto<br> with the old man in peace<br> It's possible I left a bit early,<br> the weather was awful.<br> Leonardo was in low spirits,<br> and so were you.<br> Why remind me<br> of that horrible Easter?<br> I'll tell you why.<br> Leonardo and you arrived on the<br> Thursday and we had a nice evening.<br> We drank wine, we sang and laughed,<br> and played some old game.<br> Helena wasn't so ill at that point.<br> She was jolly and happy<br> the whole evening.<br> Leonardo enjoyed her happiness.<br> He was joking and talking to her.<br> Helena immediately fell in love.<br> The two of them sat up<br> late into the night.<br> The following morning,<br> Helena told me<br> that Leonardo had kissed her.<br> That night we had guests.<br> Leonardo got drunk and played<br> all of Bach's Cello Suites.<br> He didn't seem like himself.<br> He was heavy and mild,<br> somehow enlarged.<br> He played badly but beautifully.<br> Helena sat shining in the twilight.<br> I had never seen anything like it.<br> You and I went for a walk. You talked<br> incessantly, but I wasn't listening.<br> All I could think of<br> was those two people.<br> When we returned they sat as before,<br> one in each end of the room.<br> You went upstairs to sleep.<br> I had to help Leo up the stairs.<br> He stopped outside<br> the door of your bedroom,<br> turned to face me, and said,<br> "Would you believe it?<br> "There's a butterfly<br> that's bouncing against the window."<br> When I went downstairs,<br> Helena sat erect on her chair.<br> Completely calm, completely relaxed.<br> There wasn't even the faintest trace<br> of her illness.<br> I won't forget her face, Mother.<br> I won't forget her face.<br> The following morning,<br> you left for Geneva.<br> Four days earlier<br> than we had agreed on.<br> On leaving, you said in passing,<br> "I've asked Leonardo to stay on a bit,<br> as I can see it's doing Helena good."<br> And then you smiled.<br> Leonardo suddenly became<br> restless and unhappy.<br> On Easter Day, he took a long walk<br> in the rain.<br> When he came back, he went up to<br> Helena and said he had to go,<br> but that they'd meet again.<br> Then he called you in Geneva<br> and spoke to you for half an hour.<br> He left on the last evening flight.<br> That night I was woken<br> by Helena screaming.<br> She complained of pain<br> in her hip and right leg.<br> She didn't think she could endure it<br> through the night.<br> At five o'clock I had to call for<br> an ambulance.<br> - So it's my fault that Lena fell ill?<br> - Yes, I believe so.<br> You don't mean that Lena's illness...?<br> Yes.<br> Not really...<br> You abandoned Helena<br> when she was one.<br> You continually abandoned<br> her and me.<br> When Helena became seriously ill,<br> you sent her to a home.<br> - It can't be true...<br> - What can't be true?<br> If you've got proof to the contrary,<br> please tell me.<br> Look at me, Mother.<br> Look at Helena.<br> There are no excuses.<br> There is only one truth,<br> and one lie.<br> - There is no forgiveness.<br> - You can't put all the blame on me.<br> You always wanted there to be<br> special exceptions for you.<br> You've established a kind of<br> discount system in life.<br> But at some point you must see<br> that your agreement is one-sided.<br> You must realise that you<br> carry a guilt - like everyone else.<br> What guilt?<br> Dearest Eva,<br> could you forgive me<br> for everything I've done wrong?<br> I will try to change.<br> You will teach me, we will talk.<br> But help me - I can't stand it<br> any longer.<br> Your hatred is so dreadful.<br> I haven't understood. I've been selfish<br> and childish.<br> Please hold me.<br> At least touch me.<br> Help me!<br> Mummy!<br> Come here!<br> Help me.<br> Poor little Mother,<br> rushing off like that.<br> She looked so scared,<br> and suddenly so old and tired.<br> Her face looked so small,<br> and her nose was red from crying.<br> I'll never see her again.<br> It'll soon be dark, and it's getting cold.<br> I have to go home and cook dinner<br> for Viktor and Helena.<br> I can't die now.<br> I'm scared of committing suicide.<br> One day God may want to use me,<br> and release me from my prison.<br> I feel so left out of everything.<br> I'm always homesick.<br> But when I do come home,<br> I realise it must be something else<br> that I want.<br> Erik!<br> Are you touching my cheek?<br> Are you whispering in my ear?<br> Are you with me now?<br> We'll never abandon each other.<br> The light is on in Helena's room.<br> Viktor is talking to her.<br> That's good - he's kind.<br> He's telling her Mother is gone.<br> Your mother sent her love.<br> She was upset and anxious,<br> and she'd been crying.<br> Eva has gone for a walk.<br> She was so excited about<br> seeing your mother.<br> She set her hopes too high.<br> I didn't have the heart to warn her.<br> I don't understand.<br> What do you want?<br> Try to speak slowly,<br> dearest Helena - I can't understand.<br> Eva, come here!<br> Sometimes I watch my wife,<br> without her being aware of<br> my presence.<br> She's tormented.<br> Ever since Charlotte rushed off<br> she's been so horribly tormented.<br> She hasn't been able to sleep.<br> She says she drove her mother away,<br> and she can never forgive herself.<br> - Are you going out?<br> - Yes, I'm going to the post office.<br> - Do you think you could post this?<br> - With pleasure.<br> - It's for Charlotte?<br> - You can read it if you want.<br> I'm going up to Helena.<br> "Dear Mother, I realise now<br> that I treated you badly.<br> "I came to you with demands<br> instead of with affection.<br> "I tormented you with a rancid hatred<br> that isn't there any more.<br> "I did wrong, and I ask you<br> to forgive me.<br> "I don't know whether this letter<br> will reach you.<br> "I don't even know if you'll read it.<br> "Perhaps it's too late already.<br> "But I hope that my discovery<br> won't be in vain.<br> "There is a kind of grace.<br> "I mean the opportunity we have<br> to take care of each other,<br> "to help each other,<br> "to show affection.<br> "Never again will I let you<br> disappear from my life.<br> "I'll persist.<br> "I won't give up, even if it's too late.<br> "I don't think it's too late.<br> "It mustn't be too late."<br>
