They fully<br> mature on the flight out.<br> So the progress up the stim<br> seem to work really well.<br> Yeah, they got great muscle tone.<br> It'll take us a few hours<br> to get them prepared,<br> but you can take them out tomorrow.<br> There's yours.<br> Looks like him.<br> Looks like you.<br> This is your avatar now, Jake.<br> The concept is that every driver<br> is matched to his own avatar.<br> So that their nervous system are in tuned.<br> Or something...<br> Which is why they offered me the gig,<br> because I can link with Tommy's avatar.<br> Which is insanely expensive.<br> Is this right?<br> I just say whatever<br> to the video log?<br> Yeah, we gotta get the habit<br> of documenting everything.<br> What we see, what we feel,<br> it's all part of the science.<br> Science is good observation.<br> - Plus it'll help keep you sane.<br> for the next 6 years.<br> Whatever.<br> Here I am.<br> Doing science.<br> They're coming out.<br> Attention, drivers coming out of the lane.<br> Who's got my god<br> damn cigarette?<br> Guys, what's wrong with this picture?<br> Thank you!<br> Grace Augustine is a legend.<br> She's the head of the avatar<br> program, she wrote the book.<br> I mean literally wrote the<br> book on Pandoran botany.<br> That's because she likes<br> plants better than people.<br> Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.<br> Grace I'd like you to meet<br> Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.<br> Norm, I hear good things about<br> you. How's your Na'vi?<br> If I may, Great Mother,<br> it's a pleasure to meet you.<br> Not bad, a bit rough though.<br> I've studied for 5 years,<br> but I still have much to learn.<br> Grace, this is Jake Sully.<br> I know who you are<br> and I don't need you.<br> I need your brother, the PHD<br> who trained for three<br> years for this mission...<br> He's dead.<br> I know it's a big inconvenience<br> for everyone.<br> How much lab training have you had?<br> I dissected a frog once.<br> You see?<br> They're just pissing on us with out even<br> a courtesy of calling it rain.<br> I'm going to Selfridge.<br> - No Grace!<br> This is such bullshit.<br> I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.<br> He has no business sticking<br> his nose in my department.<br> Here tomorrow, 08:00.<br> Try and use big words.<br> Did you see that?<br> - Yes sir.<br> No you didn't, you were looking at<br> the monitor. I love this putter Ronnie.<br> Parker...<br> I used to think it<br> was a knowing neglect,<br> but now I see that you're<br> intentionally screwing me.<br> Grace, I enjoy our little talks...<br> I need a researcher,<br> not some jar-head drop out.<br> Actually, I thought we<br> got lucky with him.<br> Lucky?<br> - Yeah.<br> How is this in any way lucky?<br> Lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky<br> that brother wasn't some oral hygienist.<br> A marine we could use. I'm assigning him<br> to your team as security escort.<br> The last thing I need is another<br> trigger happy moron out there.<br> You're supposed to be<br> winning the hearts and the<br> minds of the natives, isn't that the<br> whole point of your little puppet show?<br> You look like them, you talk like<br> them and they'll start trusting us.<br> We build them a school,<br> we teach them English...<br> But after how many years relations with<br> the indigenous are only getting worse.<br> That tends to happen when you<br> use machine guns on them.<br> Right, come here.<br> This is why we're here, Unobtanium.<br> Because this little gray<br> rock sells for 20 million a kilo.<br> That's the only reason.<br> It's what pays for the whole party.<br> It's what pays for<br> your science, comprendo?<br> Those savages are threatening<br> our whole operation.<br> We're on the brink of war and you're<br> supposed to be finding<br> a diplomatic solution.<br> So use what you've got<br> and get me some results.<br> How much link time do you log?<br> About 520 hours.<br> - That's good.<br> You're in there,<br> you're here.<br> How much have you logged?<br> - Zip.<br> But I red the manual.<br> Tell me you're joking.<br> This is cool.<br> Let's go.<br> Don't, I got this.<br> So you just figured you'd come out here<br> to the most hostile environment<br> known to man...<br> with no training of any kind<br> and see how it went?<br> What was going through your head?<br> Maybe I was sick of doctors<br> telling me what I couldn't do.<br> Biometrics look good.<br> - Link is ready.<br> Keep your arms in,<br> hands in.<br> Head down.<br> Just relax and let your mind go blank.<br> That shouldn't be hard for you.<br> Kiss the darkest part of my...<br> - Initiate link.<br> Run sequence, unit 3.<br> - Launching.<br> I have the first congruency.<br> That's a gorgeous brain.<br> Nice activity.<br> Go figure.<br> - Phase lock 40%.<br> I'm going in.<br> Phase lock 99%,<br> link is stable.<br> Jake can you hear me?<br> Fibrial reflexes look good.<br> Response normal.<br> How are you feeling Jake?<br> Hey guys.<br> Welcome to your<br> new body Jake. - Good.<br> We're gonna take this<br> nice and easy Jake.<br> No problem.<br> - I can see you remember that one.<br> Well, if you want to<br> sit up, that's fine.<br> Let's take it nice and slow Jake.<br> No tranquil attacks, that's good.<br> Do you feel lightheaded or dizzy?<br> Wiggling your toes.<br> - Good Jake.<br> System motor control is good.<br> Are you feeling any numbness or pain?<br> Take it easy, don't get<br> ahead of yourself.<br> There are few more sensory and motor<br> reflex tests we need to run, so tak it easy.<br> Jake listen to me.<br> Jake I need you to sit down.<br> - It's OK, I got this.<br> Jake you need to sit down.<br> - Guys get him back on the gurney.<br> You need to sit down...<br> Sedate him!<br> Jake, you're not used to your<br> avatar body, this is dangerous.<br> This is great.<br> - Come on, they're gonna put you out.<br> Sit down!<br> Come on, you ain't got no skills.<br> I don't even have to<br> play defense. - Hey guys.<br> It's OK, I'll get him.<br> - Jake you have to come inside.<br> Sorry.<br> You're not supposed to be running!<br> Sorry.<br> - Watch it.<br> Marine!<br> Damn...<br> Grace?<br> Who did you expect numb nuts?<br> Think fast!<br> Motor control is looking good.<br> Everybody quiet down.<br> Lights out.<br> C'mon Louise, chop chop.<br> Don't play with that,<br> you'll go blind.<br> That's kinda freaky.<br> -
