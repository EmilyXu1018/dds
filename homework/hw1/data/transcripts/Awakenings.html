No ...|I am not very good with people.<br> I never have been, Leonard ...|I like them.<br> I wish I had more than|a rudimentary understanding of them.<br> Maybe, if they were less unpredictable.<br> Eleanor would disagree with you.<br> - Eleanor?|- Miss Costello.<br> She has spoken to you about me?<br> What did she say?<br> That you were a kind man.|That you care very much for people.<br> I would like to put the others on the drug.|I realise this may be expensive.<br> - Have you got any idea how expensive?|- Yes, I talked to Ray.<br> I have an estimate ...<br> The pharmacist says giving all the rest|the same dosage as Mr Lowe would be -<br> - 1 2,000.<br> - How much?|- $1 2,000.<br> A month?|I cannot go before the board with that.<br> How about speaking|directly to the patrons?<br> They already give what they can.<br> We must convince them to give more|than they are accustomed to.<br> - Perhaps, if they see Mr Lowe.|- You overestimate his effect on people.<br> We are talking about money.<br> There was an extreme rigidity|of the axial musculature.<br> This is a gross impairment|of the postural reflexes.<br> It is a brain stem type of rigidity.|A meningismus.<br> What is most striking is|the profound facial masking -<br> - which we now know is not to be|confused with apathy or catatonia.<br> Less scientific.|Calm down!<br> Some things could reach him, though.<br> The mention of his name,|notes of a particular piece of music.<br> The touch of another human being.<br> But these awakenings were rare and|transient, lasting only a moment.<br> Otherwise he was as you see him here,|in a metaphorical, -<br> - if not physiological, equivalent of sleep.|Or even death.<br> This was his condition|when I found him at this hospital -<br> - and the quality of his life|for the last 30 years.<br> - Now?|- Whenever you are ready.<br> My name is Leonard Lowe.<br> It has been explained to me that|I have been away for quite some time.<br> I am back.<br> Here we go. Take her away.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Dr Sayer!|- What is it?<br> It is a fucking miracle.<br> - Where are my glasses?|- On your face.<br> Can this be so?<br> I am talking.<br> I am walking ... Who are you?<br> Thank you for coming.|Things are a little different today.<br> I ... I had the strangest dream.<br> I have to take your blood pressure.<br> I have been sitting for 25 years,|you missed your chance.<br> - I need some make-up.|- Okay, we can take care of that.<br> And some dye for my hair ... black.<br> - Black? Rose, are you sure?|- Yes, it has always been black.<br> Dr Sayer, something about fruit trees.<br> - Prune the fruit trees.|- I will.<br> I want a steak, rare.|Mashed potatoes and gravy. String beans.<br> I was aware of things, but nothing|meant anything to me.<br> It was no connection to me.|There was a war or two.<br> This morning I went to the bathroom|all by myself.<br> I think I liked them better the other way.<br> Rolando, can you speak to me?|It is Miss Costello.<br> Do you understand me?<br> - Lucy ... What year is it?|- What year is it?<br> It is '26, silly.<br> Come on, Miriam, be a sport.<br> "Like crowds storming the Bastille, the|Mighty Mets stormed their locker room -<br> - on their night to remember.<br> And touched off one of the|loudest, wildest, -<br> - wettest victory celebrations|in baseball history.<br> Released from ridicule after seven|destitute seasons, they raised the roof."<br> - Hi, Sydney.|- Hi.<br> - Will we go to the same place?|- Actually, I do not know.<br> Everybody stay together!<br> - Bring Leonard back.|- Anthony, will you get Leonard?<br> Everyone, please stay with the group.<br> - How is my father doing?|- The same.<br> - Mum, maybe you should not go.|- Of course, I want to go.<br> You cannot be there, Leonard,|or the door will not close.<br> - I do not understand. Sydney is going.|- He is a patient.<br> - Not the same kind of patient.|- He is still a patient, you are not.<br> - I am your mother.|- Are there any other mothers going?<br> What have you done to your hair?<br> - It is a tire.|- I know ... I am not an idiot.<br> - You treat me like an asshole.|- We will take care of that.<br> - Are you ready?|- I will stay here.<br> - Why?

Meatloaf, please.<br> - Meatloaf.|- Meatloaf, too.<br> Are you following me?<br> I am sorry, I was only kidding.|I saw you upstairs just now.<br> - Are you visiting someone?|- No.<br> You work here.<br> I live here.<br> You are a patient?<br> You do not look like a patient.<br> I do not?<br> I have always loved carnegia.<br> Dr Sayer ...|Did you choose this place?<br> - Why?|- I always come here.<br> It is a nice place, but after|the first hour, it loses something.<br> - Anthony thinks the group is bored.|- They are.<br> I thought about taking them|to the Opera House ...<br> Or the Museum of Natural History?<br> No ... There are|a lot of dead, stuffed things there.<br> Where else is there?<br> - Is it legal again?|- Yes, for some time.<br> Ladies, what can I get you?<br> A Rob Roy on the rocks.<br> Make that a virgin Rob Roy.<br> I work night shifts at this diner.<br> Sometimes before work|I come to see my father.<br> He used to go to all the games,|so I like to read him the sports pages.<br> I do not know if he knows I visit him.|My mother does not think so.<br> But, you do.<br> Sometimes I think I see something ...|I think I see a change.<br> And for a moment, I see him|like he was before the stroke.<br> And then it is gone; I am not sure|I saw anything. Does that make any sense?<br> Yes.<br> So, why are you here?<br> - I receive medication.|- For what?<br> Without it,|I am sort of like your father.<br> - But I am okay now.|- That is good.<br> I was so sure he wanted overeasy|with bacon, wheat toast, black coffee -<br> - I brought him his food|without taking his order.<br> He just said: "You forgot the tomato."<br> We were out of them.|That is why I did not give him one.<br> - It was really nice talking to you.|- It was nice talking to you, too.<br> - Paula?|- Yes.<br> He knows ...|Your father knows you visit him.<br> Doctor, these are my friends.<br> Is he not the cat's meow?<br> Miriam, I do not know how to say this,|so I will just say it ...<br> Your husband -<br> - was granted a divorce from you in 1953.<br> Thank God!<br> Look at that! Pontiac Firebird, 400|engine ... Now, that is a car, man.<br> - Lucy, may I have your hand?|- Take me away from this place.<br> - Wrong. It is here.|- I guess I lose.<br> I guess your luck is changing ...|Very nice.<br> - How is it going?|- How is it going?<br> Yes, how do you feel?<br> Well, my parents are dead,|my wife is in an institution, -<br> - my son has disappeared|out West somewhere ...<br> I feel old and I feel swindled.|That is how I feel.<br> I stopped by the hobby shop|and got more pencils.<br> And I got this ...<br> A small T-square.<br> I can use that, yes.<br> That is really nice.<br> - I will be right back.|- Leonard?<br> He never talked about girls before.<br> He certainly never had|anything to do with them.<br> It is a bit ridiculous, all this|girl business. Do you not think so?<br> He is a grown man.<br> He said I should take a vacation.|Go away for a few days and relax.<br> I am sure he meant|you deserve a vacation, which you do.<br> I cannot leave him alone in this place.|He would die without me.<br> Girls!<br> Hello? ... Dr Sayer?|I have to talk to you.<br> Leonard?<br> I think it is important some things|were said. I just have to talk to you.<br> What kind of things?<br> Things that matter, that have happened|to me. Things I now understand.<br> - Where are you calling from?|- Your office.<br> - It is very late.|- Is it?<br> - You stay there, I will be right over.|- Good.<br> - Dr Sayer, sit down.|- Why? What is wrong?<br> We have to tell everybody.|We have to remind them how good it is.<br> How good what is, Leonard?<br> Read the newspaper.|What does it say? It is all bad.<br> People have forgotten what life is all about.|What it is to be alive.<br> They need to be reminded of|what they have and what they can lose.<br> What I feel is the joy of life,|the gift of life, the freedom of life!<br> He says that people|do not appreciate the simple things.<br> Work, play, friendship ... family.<br> He was so excited he talked|until 5 o'clock in the morning.<br> - Is it liberation, mania ...|- Or love?<br> Yes. What he is saying is right, though.|We do not know how to live.<br> But at 5 in the morning!<br> - Waheedah ... How are you?|- I am fine.<br> - Mr Lowe, are you all right?|- Yes.<br> - What is it that you want?|- The simplest thing.<br> And that is?<br> To go for a walk if I want to,|like any normal person.<br> - You are free to go for a walk.|- I am? Alone?<br> What difference would it make?<br> Look, I am not a criminal.|I have committed no crime, -<br> - I am not a danger to myself or others.|But I am not allowed to walk by myself.<br> You did not wake a thing,|you woke a person ... I am a person.<br> Are you aware of the unconscious|hostility you exhibit towards us?<br> How can I be aware, if it is unconscious?<br> I am curious.|What would you do if you went out?<br> I would go for a walk,|look at things, talk to people.<br> Decide which direction I want to go.|All the things that you take for granted.<br> - And that is it?|- That is it.<br> All right ... we will take this into|consideration, and we will let you know.<br> - Are you all right?|- Yes, it was nothing, I was nervous.<br> What did they say?<br> That there was|insufficient data at this time -<br> - and that continued observation was|necessary for a diagnosis.<br> It is a different world out there|that you may not be prepared for.<br> They could not be held responsible|for what might happen to you.<br> They said no.<br> - And what did you say?|- They do not have to listen to me.<br> Did you agree with them?<br> Yes.<br> I am not sure we are out of the woods yet|and that this ... is nothing.<br> It is an experimental drug; we need|time to evaluate things before ...<br> - Leonard, where are you going?|- For a walk.<br> This is Dr Sayer ...<br> -Where are you going?|- I am going outside.<br> Patients are not allowed|beyond this point.<br> Do not make it hard on yourself.<br> I just want to go for a walk!<br> He is not a mental patient,|this is unnecessary. Let him go!<br> Please, he is not violent!<br> I do not understand it,|he was never any trouble before.<br> He was quiet, polite and respectful.|He never demanded anything.<br> - He was never disobedient.|- Because he was catatonic, Mrs Lowe.<br> I am speaking of when he was a boy.<br> I am sorry.<br> I do not know who that is up there.|I do not think he knows.<br> You turned him into something he is not.<br> It is not us that are defective, it is them.|We are not in crisis, they are!<br> We have been through the worst|and survived it. They fear it.<br> Because they know.<br> They know! They know!<br> Because we ... remind them -<br> - that there is a problem -<br> - which they do not have an answer to.<br> They will never be healers until they|realise this and see the problem.<br> Until they admit there is a problem,|and that the problem is not us.<br> We are not the problem,|they are the problem!<br> He has not been able to release anger|for 30 years.<br> - As the others.|- I think his behaviour is more natural.<br> You think his tics and paranoia are|signs of normal behaviour?<br> Yes, because he is in this place ...|We wake him up and lock him in a cage.<br> That is not paranoia; that is a fact.<br> I have 20 psychotics refusing to eat,|who have no idea why they are doing so.<br> - How long should that go on?|- He knows why. He wants out.<br> Mr Lowe is not the Messiah of Ward 5.|He is a man in trouble.<br> He was not resurrected,|he was given a drug by you.<br> A drug which is not all that miraculous.<br> - The others are fine ...|- He has been on it longer.<br> I sympathise with him -<br> - but I will not let him endanger|the health of the other patients.<br> - Excuse me.|- We cannot allow it.<br> He is all right.<br> - How are you today?|- I am all right.<br> - How are you?|- Never better.<br> - What is the purpose of these gentlemen?|- These gentlemen protect me.<br> - I wish I did not need them.|- Someone is trying to hurt you? Who?<br> That is the thing, is it not? Who?|One never knows.<br> Someone I least expect.|Look at history.<br> Every patient on this ward thinks|there is a plot against him.<br> They are mistaken, they are crazy.<br> You have got worse.<br> The drug is not working. All you are|experiencing are the side effects, -<br> - they make you behave this way.<br> I appreciate you coming to see me,|but I have things to do.<br> Please, look at yourself.<br> No, look at yourself!|I have a sickness.<br> Sickness took me out of this world,|and I fought to get back.<br> I fought for 30 years,|and I am still fighting.<br> But you ...<br> You have no excuse, you are just a|scared and lonely man with nothing!<br> No life, nothing!|You are the one that is asleep.<br> Your medicine could be taken away ...|They can do that.<br> You can wake up in the morning|and it will not be there.<br> Get away from me!<br> I am all right. Thank you.<br> I just fell.<br> Help me.<br> Can you walk?<br> I will not let them take the medicine away.|We will work together.<br> He has had a reaction to the drug.|He has tics.<br> He is not concerned with his appearance -<br> - but with how it will affect|the other patients.<br> We will work on his dosage;|he is prepared for any effects.<br> He wants the others to be prepared.|You have to help me with this.<br> - Hi, Leonard. Welcome back.|- Thank you.<br> - How are you doing?|- Are you all right?<br> - It got so quiet round here.|- Because we were waiting for you.<br> You are looking good, Len,|better every day.<br> What if he has just had enough of it?<br> What if it is just a matter of time|for all of us?<br> There is no medical reason to think|what happens to him will happen to you.<br> Why not?<br> You are all individuals ...|And you are well, are you not?<br> That was lovely, Lucy.<br> I learned that song a long,|long time ago.<br> I know what year it is.<br> I just cannot imagine being older|than twenty-two.<br> I have no experience at it.<br> I know it is not 1926.<br> I just need it to be.<br> - How are you, Leonard?|- Never better.<br> How are the others?|Are they talking about me?<br> - They are scared.|- They should be.<br> - Can you stop this?|- I am not sure, but I am trying.<br> - Do not give up on me.|- I will not.<br> I got a postcard from my son.<br> I am all right,|and then everything stops.<br> There is no warning, it is like a|light switch going off.<br> Something has to bring me back.|A sound, a touch, -<br> - and then I can move again,|I am okay again.<br> It is not that I feel bad,|it is just that I feel nothing.<br> It is as if I am dead. Nothing.<br> It is as if I am not a person anymore.|Just a collecion of tics.<br> Not that I mind them.|Sometimes they make life interesting.<br> I am not sure who is in control,|me or them, but they should not be there.<br> Up to 5.<br> Just a little more ...<br> It feels good when I am working.|I feel good here.<br> - The book list is coming along well.|- I would love to see it.<br> That is all right, another time.<br> - What is happening?|- You have an oculogyric crisis.<br> Get the camera!<br> I cannot do this ...|I will turn the camera off.<br> No! Watch, watch!<br> Learn, learn, learn ...|Learn for me.<br> Let us see ... 625.<br> - 675, just ...|- Okay.<br> I cannot read anymore!|I cannot keep my eyes in one place.<br> I keep going back to the beginning,|the beginning ...<br> - I have let everybody down.|- No.<br> I have let you down.|I have, I am grotesque.<br> You are not. I will not listen to this.<br> I am grotesque. Look at me|and tell me I am not!<br> You are not.<br> This is not me!<br> When my son was born healthy,|I never asked why.<br> Why was I so lucky? Had I deserved|this perfect child? This perfect life?<br> But when he got sick, you can bet|I asked why, I demanded to know why.<br> Why was this happening?|There was nothing I could do about it.<br> No one I could go to and say:|"Stop this. Please, stop this."<br> "Can you not see my son is in pain?"<br> My son is in pain. Please, stop this!<br> - He is fighting.|- He is losing.<br> I worked ... had friends over,|went dancing. That is about it.<br> That is great.|I have never done any of those things.<br> You will.<br> They will never let me out of this place|... and they should not.<br> I am still not well ...|as you can see.<br> I feel well when I see you.<br> I will not ... see you anymore.<br> I just want to say goodbye.<br> Is that not sweet?<br> - Now?|- Whenever you are ready.<br> My name is Leonard Lowe. I now know|I have been away for quite a while.<br> I am back.<br> - What is it like to be back?|- I thought it was a dream at first.<br> When did you realise it was not?<br> When I spoke and you understood me.<br> You told him I was a kind man.<br> How kind is it to give life ...|only to take it away again?<br> It is given and taken away|from all of us.<br> Why does that not comfort me?<br> Because you are a kind man.<br> Because he is your friend.<br> The summer was extraordinary. A season|of rebirth and innocence. A miracle.<br> Fifteen patients and for us,|their caretakers.<br> But now, we have to adjust to the|realities of miracles.<br> We can hide behind science and say|it was the drug that failed.<br> Or that the illness itself had returned.<br> Or the patients unable to cope with|losing decades of their lives.<br> The reality is ... we do not know|what went wrong or what went right.<br> What we do know is|as the chemical window closed -<br> - another awakening took place.<br> That the human spirit is more powerful|than any drug.<br> That is what needs to be nourished.<br> With work, play, friendship, family.<br> These are the things that matter.<br> This is what we had forgotten.<br> The simplest things.<br> - Well ... Goodnight.|- Goodnight.<br> - Eleanor?|- Yes?<br> What is wrong?<br> I was wondering what you are|doing tonight? If you have other plans ...<br> No, I was ...<br> - You have no plans?|- No, I have no ...<br> I was wondering if you ... we ...|you and I could ...<br> If we could ... go for a cup of coffee?<br> Yes, I would love to.<br> - My car is over here.|- What do you say we just walk?<br> Let us begin.<br>
