Wait a second, I do.<br> Fiona gave it to me.<br> Yes, I did.<br> Would anybody like some more?<br> Ween...<br> Wai... Wain...<br> No, but I'll have a touch of wine.<br> Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.<br> Some more wain.<br> The thing is...<br> half the time I wander around<br> looking for something<br> which I know is very pertinent.<br> I can't remember what it is.<br> Once the idea is gone,<br> everything is gone.<br> I just wander around<br> trying to figure out what it was<br> that was so important earlier.<br> I think I may be<br> beginning to disappear.<br> And what year is it?<br> Fiona, if you found a letter on the street,<br> addressed, with a stamp on it,<br> what would you do with it?<br> I'd mail it.<br> And where would you put it to mail it?<br> And if there was a fire<br> in a movie theater,<br> and you were the first person<br> to spot that fire,<br> what would you do?<br> Well, we don't go<br> to the movies much anymore,<br> do we, Grant?<br> All those multiplexes showing<br> the same American garbage.<br> Have you seen my coat?<br> There it is, dear.<br> It's on your chair.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Fiona, would you mind<br> if I asked you a few more questions?<br> Would you mind taking a seat?<br> I was just feeling<br> a little cold, that's all.<br> What an ugly baby.<br> When did we move into this cottage?<br> Was it last year<br> or the year before?<br> No. It was longer than that.<br> It was when I left the university,<br> Well, that's shocking.<br> Let's just see how it goes, shall we?<br> How is your husband doing?<br> Okay.<br> He and my wife struck up<br> quite a close friendship.<br> I heard about that.<br> So, uh,<br> I'd like to speak to you<br> about something.<br> If you have a minute.<br> My husband did not try<br> to start anything with your wife,<br> if that's what you're getting at.<br> He did not try to molest her.<br> He's incapable of it.<br> And anyway, he wouldn't.<br> From what I hear, it was the other way around.<br> No, uh, that isn't it at all.<br> I didn't come here with any complaints.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, well, I'm sorry.<br> I thought you did.<br> Maybe you should come in.<br> It's not as warm a day as it looks.<br> "Never let a person make you feel guilty<br> for your anger with God."<br> Hmm. Random.<br> I can't even see what the point is.<br> We can't be certain this is what...<br> You're far too young.<br> "Should the patient<br> afflicted with the disease<br> "remain at home...<br> the caregiver will very often be the spouse."<br> "The caregiver must preside<br> over the degeneration<br> "of someone he or she<br> loves very much,<br> "must do this for years and years<br> "with the news always<br> getting worse, not better,<br> "must put up sometimes<br> with deranged<br> "but at the same time<br> very personal insults,<br> "and must somehow learn<br> to smile through it all.<br> "Caregivers must be able to diagnose<br> "a wide variety of ordinary ailments<br> "under extraordinary circumstances.<br> "Imagine the person<br> you love the most<br> "suddenly upset about something,<br> "but completely unable<br> to communicate the problem<br> or even to understand it himself."<br> Sounds like a regular marriage.<br> Hello, there!<br> Oh!<br> Hello, there.<br> We are at that stage, Grant.<br> We are at that stage.<br> Well...<br> if we do think of it...<br> if we do...<br> then it must be as something<br> that isn't permanent.<br> A kind of experimental treatment or...<br> a rest cure of sorts.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> We can think of it that way.<br> We have to sit in the kitchen,<br> where I can hear Aubrey.<br> Well, you might as well<br> have a cup of coffee.<br> Thank you.<br> My son put him on the Sports Channel<br> a year ago Christmas.<br> I don't know what we'd do without it.<br> Must be a struggle.<br> Well, you know.<br> You know what<br> struggle is by now.<br> - You're sure?<br> - I'm sure.<br> You don't want to just get<br> a sense of the place?<br> I don't want to make<br> this decision alone.<br> What place?<br> Just kidding!<br> Fuck off.<br> You're not making<br> this decision alone, Grant.<br> I've already made up my mind.<br> Okay.<br> It's time to go home now.<br> - No, no.<br> - Mrs. Taylor...<br> - Hi. Is this your son?<br> - Yeah. I'm her son.<br> Hi. I'm Betty. It's time for your bath.<br> - Bath.<br> - Yeah.<br> You have to have a bath now.<br> Mama.<br> Mr. Andersson?<br> Madeleine Montpelier.<br> - I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.<br> - Hi, there.<br> I'm just going to take you<br> on the quick tour of the facility,<br> and then we can sit down<br> and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition<br> and the appropriate time<br> for admitting her.<br> As you can see,<br> we get a lot of natural light.<br> Yes, I can see that.<br> This is my favorite room.<br> Look, over there, as you can see,<br> they have a puzzle on the go.<br> They always have<br> a puzzle on the go.<br> - This works.<br> - You know, it's real important to us here<br> that our residents<br> maintain social function,<br> so a lot of our activities<br> and our whole layout<br> is really geared toward...<br> Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.<br> Hello, Michael.<br> Now, as you can see,<br> we're coming into our common room,<br> and again, we're really emphasizing<br> everybody being social.<br> So you can bring the family.<br> Everybody can come and visit.<br> We have a state-of-the-art<br> entertainment system<br> so the residents can gather<br> and watch together.<br> - Hi, Madeleine.<br> - Hello, ladies.<br> - Hello, Madeleine.<br> - I got a Christmas sweater.<br> Aren't you festive!<br> And this is our quiet corner<br> for crafts and reading and reflection.<br> We have a lot of activities<br> for physical activity.<br> Balloon badminton and sit and fit.<br> And here we have our<br> lovely new dining room.<br> We can accommodate<br> any dietary preferences or restrictions.<br> We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner<br> early for the families.<br> The old Meadowlake is just next door,<br> and that's a day center<br> now, but, um...<br> this for the permanent residents.<br> This is brand-spanking new.<br> So let's go upstairs, shall we?<br> Just taking my tea for a ride.<br> Oh, look at this one, Flo.<br> He's a real charmer, isn't he?<br> Would you say,<br> are you a charmer?<br> I think you could say<br> I was kind of a charmer.<br> You're a rascal.<br> Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.<br> Behave yourself.<br> I should have known it.<br> At this age, it's...<br> What do the kids call it, Flo? It's...<br> It's a real clusterfuck.<br> All the charmers are taken.<br> Or dead. Mostly dead.<br> You're kind of charming<br> yourself, sweetheart.<br> Shall we?<br> This is our second floor,<br> the extended care wing.<br> The elevators, of course,<br> have the lockdown system,<br> and this is where<br> the patients can move to<br> once they become more progressed.<br> Interesting choice of words.<br> Why don't I show you some of the rooms here,<br> while we're at it?<br> Then we can go back down<br> and see the regular rooms<br> where Mrs. Andersson will be living.<br> No, that will not be necessary.<br> My wife will not be<br> progressing to this floor.<br> All right.<br> Who chooses the music?<br> I'm sorry?<br> I'm assuming it's not the residents.<br> I don't see any of them<br> singing along.<br> Yeah, well. You know the rooms on the regular<br> floors all have their own stereo systems<br> so the patients can listen<br> to whatever they like.<br> How kind.<br> Now, we don't admit anyone<br> during the month of December,<br> so Mrs. Andersson will<br> have to wait till January<br> to make the big move.<br> Just December, Christmas, you know, too<br> many emotional pitfalls.<br> - Right.<br> - Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.<br> I'm looking for those documents<br> on Aubrey Burke.<br> Sure. Go ahead.<br> Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy,<br> our new managing nurse.<br> Against some people's<br> better judgment.<br> Now, now.<br> Mr. Andersson is here about his wife,<br> Mrs. Andersson,<br> who will be joining us in January.<br> - Hi, there.<br> - Hi.<br> We also have a policy,<br> which I'm sure you saw<br> in the brochure,<br> that our new residents<br> are not allowed visitors<br> or receiving phone calls<br> during the first 30 days,<br> just to give them a chance to settle in.<br> What sort of visitors?<br> Everyone. Even close relatives.<br> I couldn't just leave her here.<br> We understand,<br> it is very difficult<br> to leave a loved one<br> in a new environment for so long,<br> but most people need<br> that time to settle in.<br> Before we had this rule in place,<br> residents would forget<br> again and again<br> why they were being left here.<br> Whereas we find,<br> you give them the month<br> to settle in,<br> and they're happy as clams.<br> And after that, a little visit home<br> every now and then, perfectly fine.<br> We'll take good care<br> of her, I promise.<br> - Knock-knock.<br> - Oh, no! Not again.<br> Knock-knock. Boo.<br> - She's bringing two babies.<br> - Two babies?<br> She's got a new baby,<br> four months old.<br> Smells good.<br> I was going to go for a ski,<br> but I thought I shouldn't chance it,<br> what with the Alzheimer's and all.<br> Why didn't you wake me?<br> What are these, Grant?<br> Those are the documents<br> you're supposed to sign<br> if you decide to go to Meadowlake.<br> That is exactly<br> what I have decided.<br> You were to go and sign these<br> and leave them there.<br> I wouldn't be allowed<br> to visit you for 30 days.<br> after 44 years.<br> I don't think I like the place.<br> I don't think we should be looking<br> for something we like, Grant.<br> I don't think we'll ever find that.<br> I think all we can aspire<br> to in this situation<br> is a little bit of grace.<br> I suppose I'll be<br> dressed up all the time.<br> It will be sort of like... in a hotel.<br> How do I look?<br> Just like always.<br> Just as you've always looked.<br> And how does that look?<br> Direct and vague...<br> sweet and ironic.<br> Is that how I look?<br> Oh. Remember?<br> Surprised, Grant?<br> No, I'm not surprised.<br> I'm just grateful<br> you can remember that.<br> I'm not all gone, Grant. Just...<br> going...<br> There are things<br> I wish would go away.<br> But won't. You know.<br> Things we don't talk about.<br> You never left me.<br> You still made love to me,<br> despite disturbing demands elsewhere.<br> But all those sandals, Grant.<br> All those bare female toes.<br> What could you do but be a part of the time<br> you were a part of?<br> All those pretty girls.<br> Didn't seem like anyone<br> was willing to be left out.<br> I think you did all right,<br> compared to some<br> of your colleagues.<br> Those who left their wives.<br> And the women who<br> wouldn't put up with it.<br> I think people are too demanding.<br> People want to be in love<br> every single day.<br> What a liability. And then that silly girl.<br> That silly girl Veronica.<br> Girls that age<br> are always going around<br> saying they're going<br> to kill themselves.<br> But that was that.<br> Promised me a new life.<br> We moved out here,<br> that is exactly what you gave me.<br> How long ago was that?<br> God, that's shocking.<br> So you see, I'm going...<br> but I'm not gone.<br> - Fiona.<br> - Grant.<br> Don't go.<br> That's what is happening, Grant.<br> It's happening... right now.<br> Fiona.<br> Hello. I'm checking in today.<br> My name is Fiona Andersson.<br> Yes, Mrs. Andersson.<br> We have your room<br> all ready for you.<br> - Perfect.<br> - We'll have our supervisor,<br> Mrs. Montpelier, show you.<br> I'll go fetch her. She's expecting you.<br> Thank you.<br> Fiona.<br> Grant.<br> I can't go away from you like this.<br> We had nothing<br> to tie us down, Grant.<br> You could have just driven away<br> and forsaken me.<br> But you didn't.<br> I thank you for that.<br> - Mrs. Andersson.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - How do you do? I'm Madeleine.<br> - Hello.<br> Should I give you two a moment?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Yes, please.<br> All right, then, well,<br> we'll get you settled in your room,<br> and then I'd like to give you<br> a tour of the facility.<br> - That'd be lovely. Thank you.<br> - Right this way.<br> So, as you can see,<br> we get a lot of natural light.<br> Here we go.<br> Yes. This'll do just fine.<br> Good. I'm so glad<br> you like it. Now, is...<br> is this all you brought<br> with you today?<br> - For now.<br> - We'll see how it goes.<br> Well, if you need any help arranging things,<br> you just let me know.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.<br> Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say<br> good-bye to my husband.<br> We haven't been apart for a month<br> for the last 44 years.<br> It could be quite something.<br> Okay.<br> Please, Fiona.<br> Grant.<br> Fiona...<br> You know what I'd like?<br> I'd like to make love,<br> and then I'd like you to go.<br> Because I need to stay here,<br> and if you make it hard for me,<br> I might cry so hard<br> I'll never stop.<br> Go now.<br> Go now.<br> "All of the officers<br> "were from outside<br> the local area,<br> "and it probably had not<br> entered their minds<br> "that almost all of us<br> were named McDonald.<br> "Nobody moved except for<br> the shuffling of feet.<br> The red roo"...Hey.<br> - Hello, there.<br> - Kristy. We met on your tour.<br> How's Mrs. Andersson?<br> Has she settled in?<br> I'm wondering if I could have<br> a moment of your time<br> to ask your advice?<br> Oh, sure. I was just<br> reading to Mr. Burke here.<br> Maybe when we finish this chapter,<br> I can come find you<br> in the dining room?<br> Sure. That's fine.<br> "The red roof lights<br> revolved in the afternoon sun,<br> and even the dogs were<br> temporarily quiet."<br> Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.<br> Now, how can I help you?<br> Going down the center<br> of the dining room...<br> That's Frank. He used to be the play-by-play<br> guy for the Winnipeg Jets.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> He loved his job too much to retire.<br> Frank's on the second floor.<br> I just... My wife has always been<br> sort of a different sort of person.<br> I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be<br> confirmed until after...<br> And on our way here today,<br> we passed this conservation area<br> where we went<br> for a walk last spring.<br> And there were these gorgeous flowers.<br> The skunk lilies.<br> Oh, those are<br> beautiful, aren't they?<br> Yes, they really made<br> an impression, see?<br> And even though the whole<br> place was covered in snow,<br> she said, "Oh, remember?"<br> Now, that was...<br> that was... quite recently.<br> And isn't the short-term memory<br> the thing that goes first?<br> Well, yeah, but not all at once.<br> And what's comforting<br> is the long-term memory sometimes<br> stays for quite a long time.<br> Yeah, her long-term memory<br> seems quite intact.<br> But when she mentioned that,<br> about the skunk lilies,<br> it was all I could do not<br> to turn the truck around.<br> What if this is just her<br> just being herself?<br> She's far too young to...<br> She is young.<br> And it is hard.<br> No doubt about that.<br> A month is a real long time.<br> I mean, between you and me,<br> I don't know about the policy myself.<br> I think it makes it easier for the staff<br> is what I think.<br> Look. I'll give you my pager number.<br> You can call me<br> whenever you want.<br> You can call me every day<br> if you feel like it.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Mr. Andersson,<br> your wife wrote you this note,<br> and she asked me to pass it along.<br> Okay.<br> Thank you so much.<br> "Throughout much of the thinking brain,<br> gooey plaques now crowd neurons<br> from outside the cell membranes."<br> "And knotty tangles<br> mangle microtubal transports<br> from inside the cells."<br> "All told, tens of millions<br> of synapses dissolve away."<br> "Because the structures<br> and substructures of the brain<br> "are so highly specialized,<br> "the precise location<br> of the neuronal loss<br> determines what specific abilities<br> will become impaired."<br> "It is like a series<br> of circuit breakers<br> in a large house,<br> flipping off one by one."<br> That's a great-Iooking coffee maker.<br> I always meant to get one of those.<br> I saw they had them on sale<br> at Canadian Tire.<br> They gave it to us, my son and his wife.<br> They live in Kamloops, B.C.<br> They send us more stuff<br> than we can handle.<br> Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money<br> to come see us instead.<br> I suppose they're busy<br> with their own lives.<br> Not so busy they couldn't<br> go to Hawaii last year.<br> I mean, you could understand it<br> if there was someone<br> in the family closer at hand,<br> but, uh... he's the only one.<br> People do get Ionely,<br> especially when they're deprived<br> of seeing someone they care about.<br> Fiona, for instance.<br> My wife.<br> I thought you said<br> you went and visited her.<br> I do.<br> No, that's not it.<br> She's really settling in well.<br> Good. Good.<br> Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow,<br> Mr. Andersson.<br> Right. So I'll see you<br> tomorrow morning, then.<br> Now, remember,<br> she may be a little surprised to see you.<br> Don't be shaken by that.<br> Just... She hasn't seen you in a while.<br> She's sort of settled in here.<br> I understand.<br> There you are. I'll walk you down to her.<br> Wow. Narcissus this early.<br> You must have spent a fortune.<br> We brought it back here.<br> Hi, Mr. Andersson.<br> It's great to see you.<br> I'm gonna help you find<br> your sweater, Mrs. Albright.<br> All right. Here we are.<br> There is her room, right over there.<br> You remember from last time<br> you were here, don't you?<br> Her nameplate's right on the door.<br> I'll leave you to it.<br> There she is. Now you just<br> go over and say hello,<br> and try not to startle her...<br> Remember, she may not...<br> Well, just go ahead.<br> Bridge. Deadly serious.<br> Quite rabid about it.<br> I can remember being like that<br> at college for a while.<br> My friends and I would cut class<br> and sit in the common room and smoke<br> and play like cutthroats.<br> One's name was Phoebe.<br> I don't remember the others.<br> Phoebe Hart.<br> Oh, you knew her, too.<br> Can I get you something?<br> A cup of tea?<br> I'm afraid the coffee's<br> not up to much here.<br> I don't drink tea.<br> Oh.<br> I brought you some flowers.<br> I thought they might do<br> to brighten up your room.<br> I went to your room,<br> but you weren't there.<br> Well, no, I'm here.<br> So you've made a new friend.<br> Oh, that's just Aubrey.<br> The funny thing is I knew<br> him years and years ago.<br> He used to work in the store,<br> the hardware store where<br> my grandpa used to shop.<br> He and I were always kidding around,<br> but he never could get up<br> the nerve to ask me out.<br> Until the very last weekend,<br> he took me to a ball game.<br> But my grandpa showed up<br> to drive us home.<br> I was up visiting for the summer.<br> Visiting my grandparents.<br> They lived in a cottage on a lake.<br> Fiona, I know where<br> your grandparents lived.<br> It's where we lived. We live.<br> Really?<br> I'd better go back.<br> He thinks he can't play<br> without me sitting there.<br> It's silly. I hardly<br> know the game anymore.<br> I'm afraid you'll have<br> to excuse me.<br> Will you be through soon?<br> We should be. I mean, it depends.<br> If you asked that grim-Iooking<br> lady over there nicely,<br> she'll get you a cup of tea.<br> - No, I'm fine.<br> - I can leave you, then?<br> You can entertain yourself?<br> Must all seem strange to you.<br> But you'll be surprised<br> how soon you get used to it.<br> You'll get to know who everybody is,<br> except that some of them<br> are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?<br> Can't expect them all<br> to get to know who you are.<br> Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.<br> What do you think?<br> Do you think I'd look<br> good with red hair?<br> You caught her at sort of a bad moment,<br> involved in a game.<br> She isn't even playing.<br> Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.<br> Now, who is Aubrey?<br> That's who he is, Aubrey.<br> You know, they get<br> these attachments.<br> That kind of takes over for a while.<br> Best buddy kind of thing.<br> Sort of a phase.<br> Does she even know who I am?<br> No, she might not.<br> Not today, and then,<br> tomorrow you never know.<br> Things change back and forth all the time.<br> You'll see the way it is<br> once you get used to coming here.<br> You'll learn not to take it so personal.<br> Learn to take it day by day.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I'll have to go and fix that now.<br> Here's Yung Menenikenaha,<br> desperately clinging<br> to his one-stroke lead.<br> Here's the swing.<br> It doesn't look good.<br> Looks like he's pushed it<br> out to the right.<br> It lands 25 feet from the green.<br> This must be disappointing.<br> It doesn't look good<br> for Yung Menenikenaha.<br> He was three strokes<br> on the happy side of par<br> until these last three holes.<br> Look at you, Mr. Andersson.<br> I think you might be<br> one of our most frequent visitors.<br> Hi, Fiona.<br> Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?<br> I brought you some books.<br> They don't seem to have<br> an awful lot around here.<br> Letters from Iceland by Auden.<br> We always meant to read that together,<br> didn't we?<br> Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Um, Aubrey's card game<br> starts in a few minutes,<br> and then we usually go walking,<br> and then he does his drawing...<br> Or perhaps you can find<br> a bit of time later on.<br> Um, I'll stay here.<br> Or I'll come back in a few hours.<br> Oh, you are persistent,<br> aren't you?<br> Up comes Kapanen... Boy, oh, boy!<br> Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.<br> It's sudden-death overtime.<br> They're tied 2-2.<br> Here are the Leafs again,<br> led by Andreychuk.<br> He carries it over the blue line,<br> winds up a shot right on!<br> The bounce, the rebound<br> comes back behind the net.<br> McCabe couldn't get to it.<br> It goes back on the left wing<br> and here come the Flyers<br> led by Roenick again.<br> Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome<br> this two has been.<br> A shot right on!<br> Oh, it just went wide.<br> - Go for it, Frank.<br> - Over to the right side.<br> Here we go again. The Leafs again.<br> Here's Sundin carrying it<br> up over the line.<br> Can't get a shot away<br> and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.<br> A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia<br> over on the left wing...<br> I just came down to say<br> Aubrey is having his nap<br> if you'd like to, um, talk.<br> Oh, sure.<br> Can we go somewhere<br> a little more private?<br> ...the side with Mitchell.<br> He shoots, he scores!<br> If... If you'd like.<br> And Philly wins this series<br> by a score of 3-2.<br> That's it this season for the Leafs.<br> Look at Phil Hitchcock.<br> Is he a happy coach.<br> Philadelphia wins 3-2.<br> The game is over<br> in sudden-death overtime.<br> Y-You said you had<br> some books for me?<br> This.<br> Letters from Iceland.<br> Yes, yes.<br> You said by Auden.<br> Yes. That's right.<br> Now... where is Iceland?<br> Well, Iceland is<br> in the middle of the Atlantic.<br> It's an island.<br> Youngest country in the world.<br> It's constantly erupting.<br> Volcanoes, earthquakes.<br> It's always shaking itself off.<br> Wouldn't it be nice to come<br> from a young country?<br> You do. That's where you're from.<br> That's where<br> your people are from.<br> They immigrated here in the late 1800s.<br> But that's where you're from, Fiona.<br> And I teach... Well, I taught<br> the myths from there.<br> Norse mythology.<br> l-I must have been there, then.<br> Have I been there?<br> No.<br> Oh.<br> Why not? Wasn't I curious?<br> You were very curious.<br> Very curious.<br> You always said<br> there ought to be one place<br> that you knew about<br> and you thought about<br> and maybe even longed for,<br> but you did never did get to see.<br> Did I say that?<br> Yes, you said that.<br> Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.<br> He'll be wanting a little<br> walk around, I suppose.<br> It was nice chatting.<br> You'll be back again<br> tomorrow, I suppose?<br> Fiona, what are you doing...<br> What are you doing with Aubrey?<br> He doesn't confuse me.<br> He doesn't confuse me at all.<br> Well, it's been nice chatting.<br> I'll see you again<br> tomorrow, I suppose.<br> These affections between residents,<br> do they ever go too far?<br> Well, that depends<br> on what you mean.<br> The problem we have here, it's funny.<br> It's actually often the ones<br> who haven't been friendly<br> with each other at all.<br> I mean, they maybe<br> don't even know each other<br> beyond knowing, like,<br> is it a man or is it a woman?<br> And you'd think it'd be the old guys<br> trying to crawl in bed<br> with the old ladies,<br> but half the time<br> it's the other way around.<br> It's the old ladies<br> going after the old men.<br> It could be they aren't so worn out.<br> Now don't get me wrong.<br> I don't mean Fiona.<br> Fiona is a lady.<br> She's a real lady.<br> I sometimes wonder...<br> You wonder what?<br> I wonder if she isn't putting on<br> some kind of... charade.<br> A what?<br> Some kind of act.<br> Maybe some kind of punishment.<br> Why would she do that?<br> Oh.<br> Are you getting tired?<br> - No.<br> - Are you certain...<br> Excuse me.<br> Yes, Mr. Andersson?<br> How can I help you?<br> Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.<br> Well, it's pretty, isn't it?<br> No, it's not pretty. It's tacky.<br> - She would never wear it.<br> - Well, I'll tell you what.<br> You can talk to the duty attendant<br> on Mrs. Andersson's wing.<br> Boy, it's a marvel, really,<br> the way she's getting him up<br> and out of that chair.<br> Can you manage?<br> Will you be all right?<br> I'll be back in a second.<br> Fiona, I'm your husband.<br> Fiona, it's Grant.<br> We've been married for 45 years.<br> Look at me, Fiona.<br> That is not your sweater.<br> We had a good life together.<br> Those are your words,<br> Fiona, not mine.<br> That is not your sweater.<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right. It's all right.<br> I'm coming straight back.<br> I'm coming straight back.<br> It's going to be all right.<br> I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.<br> Please...<br> don't.<br> Please, please don't.<br> You're very persistent, aren't you?<br> I wish l...<br> Wish I knew what...<br> We'll see you again<br> tomorrow, I suppose.<br> You're not doing<br> too well, are you?<br> Well, no big surprise.<br> What we're handling isn't so easy.<br> I thought when I married,<br> I'd be with someone to the final stretch.<br> I'm betting you thought the same.<br> Well, didn't work out.<br> So, I, uh, think<br> you're here for a reason.<br> I'm the kind of person you can<br> say things flat out to, so shoot.<br> I wonder if you would consider<br> taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake,<br> maybe just for a visit.<br> Or I suppose I could take Aubrey<br> out there myself.<br> I wouldn't mind that at all.<br> Homemade.<br> Really?<br> No. No, I can't do that.<br> And the reason is<br> I don't want to upset him.<br> But wouldn't he understand<br> it was just a visit?<br> He understands everything.<br> Now, if I go to all that trouble,<br> I'd prefer to take him someplace<br> that'd be more fun?<br> It would make more sense<br> to take him to the mall<br> where there are kids and whatnot.<br> And then I'd have to get him all ready,<br> maneuver him into the car.<br> He's a big man. He's not that easy to manage.<br> Even if I agreed to do it?<br> You couldn't do it.<br> You don't know him.<br> You couldn't manage him.<br> And he wouldn't stand<br> your doing for him.<br> And after all that, what would he get out of it?<br> Smoke?<br> No. No, thanks.<br> What, did you never,<br> or did you quit?<br> I quit.<br> How long ago?<br> Oh, 30 years, maybe more.<br> I quit quitting.<br> Just made a resolution to quit quitting,<br> that's all.<br> So your wife's depressed, huh?<br> What's her name again? I forget.<br> Fiona.<br> And how old were you when you met?<br> She was 18.<br> Holy, that's pretty young<br> to get married, eh?<br> Wasn't my idea.<br> You mean she proposed to you?<br> Well, that's lovely,<br> that's what I think.<br> How'd she do it?<br> She hadn't planned it necessarily.<br> We were in Tobermory<br> waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin,<br> and it was miserable and rainy,<br> and she was in a good mood.<br> She didn't want any part<br> of my sour mood.<br> And what'd she do, what'd she say?<br> Well, she said,<br> "Do you think it'd be fun...<br> Do you think it'd be fun<br> if we got married?"<br> And what did you say?<br> I took her up on it.<br> I shouted yes.<br> I never wanted<br> to be away from her.<br> She had the spark of life.<br> You know, nothing can take away<br> what's happened to you<br> and what you've experienced.<br> I don't think so, anyway.<br> Even if it goes away somehow,<br> it's still there.<br> It's still what you are.<br> It's curious.<br> What's curious?<br> All of that "madly in love" business.<br> The beginning.<br> I hear myself tell the story,<br> and it all sounds so crucial.<br> I suppose it is.<br> But compared to what we ended up with,<br> until recently...<br> all of that seems<br> so superficial somehow.<br> Not such a fun place to visit, eh?<br> Excuse me?<br> Not such a fun place to visit.<br> Fucking depressing.<br> No offense.<br> None taken.<br> No one came to visit you, huh?<br> That must suck huge.<br> Well, it would suck huge,<br> but I don't live here.<br> I'm just visiting someone.<br> Who? Which one?<br> Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.<br> The one sitting with her husband?<br> - You might say that.<br> - Why wouldn't you?<br> I wouldn't say that<br> because I'm her husband.<br> So why aren't you sitting with her, then?<br> Just learned to give her some space.<br> She's in love with that man<br> she's sitting with.<br> I don't like to disturb her.<br> I just like to see her, I suppose.<br> Make sure she's<br> doing well, you know?<br> I suppose that must seem<br> rather pathetic.<br> I should be so lucky.<br> Come on.<br> She's not here.<br> She's sick.<br> He's not here, either.<br> I brought you a book.<br> It's all about Iceland.<br> Thought you might like to take a look at it.<br> Why, thank you.<br> Oh, what is it, dear heart?<br> What is it? Oh, I see.<br> Here. Here. Here.<br> Here, here, yes.<br> Do you by any chance have<br> any influence around here?<br> I've seen you talking to them.<br> Oh.<br> We'll get to see each other.<br> You'll see. We have to.<br> I'll come and see you,<br> and you'll come and see me.<br> You know, I just wish his wife<br> would hurry up and get here.<br> I wish she'd get him out of here<br> and cut the agony short.<br> Should I stay?<br> Don't worry. She's not sick, you know.<br> To keep her company.<br> Well, they have to learn to get<br> over these things by themselves.<br> They've got short memories,<br> and that's not always so bad.<br> Okay?<br> Fiona. Her name is Fiona.<br> And what's yours?<br> I don't think I was ever told that.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. It's Grant.<br> Hello, Grant.<br> I'm Marian.<br> Well, now that we know<br> each other's name,<br> I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.<br> I don't know if he's still<br> so stuck on seeing your...<br> seeing Fiona.<br> I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.<br> But I don't feel like<br> putting him back in there<br> in case it turns out<br> to be more than that.<br> I don't want him<br> getting hard to handle.<br> I don't have any help. It's just me here.<br> I'm it.<br> It is very hard for you.<br> Did... Did you ever consider<br> his going in there for good?<br> No. I'm keeping him right here.<br> Well, that's very good<br> and noble of you.<br> Oh, you think so?<br> Well, noble is not<br> what I'm thinking about.<br> No, but it isn't easy.<br> No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.<br> If I pay to put him in there,<br> I won't hold on to the house,<br> and the house is the only thing<br> we own outright.<br> And it means a lot to me,<br> this house does.<br> It's very nice.<br> Well, I guess it's all right.<br> I've done a lot on it,<br> fixing it up, keeping it up.<br> Yes, I can see<br> that you have... you do.<br> - I don't want to lose it.<br> - No.<br> - I'm not going to lose it.<br> - I see your point.<br> See, the company<br> left us high and dry.<br> In the end, they said<br> he owed them money.<br> What do I think?<br> Well, he was pretty stupid.<br> But I'm not supposed<br> to ask, so I shut up.<br> You've been married, huh?<br> I mean, you are married.<br> You know what it's like.<br> And then, in the middle of all this,<br> he gets sick from this virus,<br> and he goes into a coma.<br> So that pretty much<br> takes him off the hook, hmm?<br> It's bad luck.<br> It's, no, just life.<br> Can't beat life.<br> No.<br> Oh. Hello.<br> Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.<br> I don't have any books.<br> Oh, there are some.<br> Letters from Iceland.<br> "Isn't it true,<br> however far we've wandered<br> "into our provinces<br> of persecution,<br> "where our regrets accuse,<br> we keep returning<br> "back to the common faith<br> "from which we've all dissented,<br> "back to the hands,<br> the feet, the faces?<br> "Children are always there<br> and take the hands,<br> "even when they are most terrified.<br> "Those in love cannot<br> make up their minds to go or stay.<br> "Artist and doctor return most often.<br> "Only the mad will never,<br> never come back.<br> "For doctors keep<br> on worrying while away,<br> "in case their skill<br> is suffering and deserted.<br> "Lovers have lived so long<br> with giants and elves,<br> "they want belief again<br> in their own size.<br> "And the artist prays ever so gently,<br> "'Let me find pure<br> all that can happen.<br> "'Only uniqueness is success.<br> "'For instance,<br> let me perceive the images of history.<br> "'AII that I push away<br> with doubt and travel,<br> today's and yesterday's alike,<br> like bodies."'<br> To all the men and women<br> of the United States Armed Forces<br> now in the Middle East,<br> the peace of a troubled world<br> and the hopes of an oppressed people<br> now depend on you.<br> How could they forget Vietnam?<br> The air strike started again<br> at 5 A.

Bye-bye.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> I think I want to ask you<br> about the second floor,<br> just to know a little more about it.<br> Well, it's for people<br> who've really lost it.<br> What do they do, then?<br> What happens after that?<br> After they've... Iost it?<br> You don't really want to know.<br> But, you know,<br> sometimes they get it back.<br> They go into their room for a year,<br> they don't know you from Adam,<br> and then one day, it's,<br> "Oh, hi. When are we going home?"<br> I mean, all of a sudden,<br> they're back to normal.<br> But it doesn't last for long.<br> You think,<br> "Oh, wow, back to normal,"<br> and then they're gone again, like so.<br> I haven't even asked you<br> about yourself.<br> You married?<br> Well, technically, yeah, I guess.<br> Got three kids.<br> Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.<br> He's making it rich, maybe.<br> I wouldn't know.<br> Must be quite a struggle.<br> It, uh... knocks the wind<br> out of you every now and then,<br> but you just pick yourself<br> back up like everyone else.<br> I suppose our lives<br> must seem easy to you.<br> We got through life<br> without too much going wrong.<br> What we have to suffer<br> now, when we're old,<br> hardly counts, I suppose.<br> That's what you must think.<br> Well, how would you<br> know what I think?<br> To tell you the truth, I'd rather be<br> the one that stayed<br> than the one that left.<br> I'll bet you weren't always<br> the doggedly devoted husband.<br> Am I right?<br> I mean, you said that you wondered<br> if maybe she was punishing<br> you for something?<br> I'll bet you had something<br> pretty specific in mind, didn't you?<br> You know, you see a lot<br> of things in this job.<br> You see the end of things<br> all day long.<br> And in my experience,<br> at the end of things<br> it's almost always<br> the men that think<br> that not too much went wrong.<br> I wonder if your wife<br> feels the same way.<br> I wonder that, too.<br> I bet you do.<br> Uh, hello, Grant.<br> I hope I got the right person.<br> I just thought of something.<br> There is a dance here in town<br> at the Legion on Saturday night,<br> and I am on the supper committee,<br> which means I can bring a free guest.<br> So I wondered whether you would<br> happen to be interested in that.<br> Call me back<br> when you get a chance.<br> I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.<br> Well, you probably recognize<br> the voice, the accent.<br> It's Marian.<br> I'm still not so used<br> to these machines,<br> and I wanted to say<br> I realize you're not single<br> and I don't mean it that way.<br> I'm not, either.<br> But it doesn't hurt<br> to get out once in a while.<br> Anyway, now I've said all this,<br> I really hope<br> it's you I'm talking to.<br> It did sound like your voice.<br> If you're interested, you can call me.<br> And if you are not,<br> you don't need to bother.<br> I just thought you might<br> like the chance to get out.<br> It's Marian speaking.<br> I guess I already said that.<br> Okay, then. Good-bye.<br> "The desires of the heart<br> "are as crooked as corkscrews.<br> "Not to be born is the best for man.<br> "The second-best<br> is a formal order.<br> The dance's pattern:<br> dance while you can."<br> Fiona?<br> Is there any way to let this go...<br> do you think?<br> If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder<br> when I bump into it again.<br> Okay.<br> "Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.<br> The tune is catchy<br> and will not stop."<br> "Dance till the stars<br> "come down from the rafters.<br> Dance, dance, dance<br> till you drop."<br> Yes?<br> Hello, Marian.<br> So...<br> There you are.<br> Here I am.<br> Thank you.<br> What are you thinking?<br> Not an awful lot, really.<br> Skiing.<br> Downhill?<br> Cross-country.<br> I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.<br> What are you thinking?<br> I'm thinking you never know<br> how things are going to turn out.<br> You almost know...<br> but you can never be quite sure.<br> Mr. Andersson?<br> Mr. Andersson?<br> Now, as you know, we're, uh,<br> we're going to have<br> to think about moving<br> Mrs. Andersson upstairs<br> fairly soon, I'm afraid.<br> She hasn't been out of that bed<br> for two weeks now, and...<br> I'm quite aware of your policies.<br> I'm more than aware<br> of your bloody policies.<br> Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me<br> back to the second floor.<br> The area to my right<br> are the elevators,<br> and as we go on down the hall,<br> there's a man with a broken heart,<br> broken in a thousand pieces.<br> Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office,<br> past the lunchroom.<br> Hopefully, they're serving right now.<br> The cannelloni<br> was cold yesterday,<br> but let's see what it's doing today.<br> Let's have... I gotta have<br> some Cokes again.<br> That's what I'm going to do.<br> Wouldn't it be better if...<br> when we go out again,<br> to put Aubrey<br> back into Meadowlake?<br> Just for a day?<br> What do you think?<br> I'm thinking that sometimes you...<br> just have to make<br> the decision to be happy.<br> Just decide.<br> Things aren't ever<br> what you hoped they'd be.<br> Not ever, for anybody.<br> The only thing that separates<br> one kind of person from another<br> is there are some<br> who stay angry about it<br> and there are some who...<br> accept what comes their way.<br> And which kind of person are you?<br> I was pretty mad about it.<br> But now...<br> Iooking at what came my way...<br> I think I could be<br> the other kind of person.<br> Quite the philosopher, huh?<br> Look, why don't you pull over here?<br> Just... pull over, could you?<br> I know what you're doing.<br> It would be easier for me<br> if you could pretend a little.<br> Do you think you could do that?<br> Now, what were we talking about?<br> She was the only one in her family<br> who bothered to learn sign language.<br> Now she can't remember how,<br> or maybe even who she is.<br> Her daughter?<br> Yeah.<br> It's left her pretty stranded.<br> Marooned.<br> You know, I thought of you the other day.<br> You know that billboard out in front<br> of the United Church in Bradford,<br> they post all that biblical-type stuff?<br> The other day, it said,<br> "It's never too late<br> to become what you<br> might have been."<br> Doesn't sound all that biblical.<br> Well, maybe they're<br> getting creative on us.<br> See you soon, Aubrey.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks.<br> Would you mind<br> if I had a moment alone<br> before you come in?<br> To explain things to her?<br> I found this beautiful book<br> about Iceland.<br> You wouldn't think they'd leave<br> valuable books lying around.<br> People who stay here<br> aren't all necessarily honest.<br> And I think they got<br> the clothes mixed up.<br> I never wear yellow.<br> I seem to remember you<br> reading this to me.<br> You were trying<br> to make me feel better.<br> You tried so hard.<br> You're a lovely man, you know?<br> I'm a very lucky woman.<br> - Fiona?<br> - You've been gone a long time.<br> Are we all checked out?<br> I have a surprise for you.<br> Do you remember Aubrey?<br> Names elude me.<br> I'm happy to see you.<br> You could've just driven away.<br> Just driven away<br> without a care in the world<br> and forsook me.<br> Forsooken me.<br> Forsaken.<br> Not a chance.<br>
