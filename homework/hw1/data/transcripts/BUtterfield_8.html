                        Liggett.<br> Liggett?<br> Good morning, Mr. Liggett.<br> -Morning.<br> Butterfield 8? Hi, it's Gloria.<br> Any messages?<br> Johnny. George.<br> -Listen...<br> ...a Mr. Liggett will call sometime<br> today. He might use Mr. L.<br> Find me wherever I am.<br> This is one call I want to take<br> personally and immediately.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> Taxi!<br> Double your tip for a cigarette.<br> What's the matter, you crazy?<br> You're in good voice this morning.<br> I'm from the Census Bureau.<br> Good morning.<br> How many persons<br> do you have living here?<br> Just one. Me.<br> -Well, that's not nearly enough.<br> You working?<br> -Trying to. Tomorrow's arrangements.<br> Tribute. -To what?<br> -Your faith, hope and charity.<br> Sunday morning and scotch<br> on your breath?<br> Well, it's good scotch.<br> Twenty years old. -And cigar smoke?<br> I always said I'd try anything once.<br> -Ever try common sense?<br> Only in desperation.<br> Notice anything unusual about me<br> this morning? -I wish I could.<br> Look.<br> Well, look! -You're panting<br> to tell me where you got it.<br> I stole it.<br> -Sure you did. It figures.<br> Oh, not for real. Just long enough<br> to get even with somebody.<br> Even for what?<br> Somebody made me so damn mad.<br> He left me money.<br> He actually left me money.<br> What would you have done?<br> -I don't know.<br> My work is designed so people<br> will leave me money.<br> This wasn't work.<br> Besides, my dress was torn.<br> I had nothing to wear so I borrowed<br> something spiteful and elegant.<br> Liggett.<br> Weston Ansbury Liggett.<br> Do you know him?<br> -Heard of him. He's very social.<br> And very Yale. -What's with<br> you and Yale? Always Yale.<br> It's the last college left.<br> -Why?<br> I started with Amherst, and I worked<br> my way through the alphabet to Yale.<br> I'm stuck there.<br> Of course, I could work<br> backwards again.<br> Did he tell you about his wife?<br> Killjoy.<br> -I hear he's a lush.<br> A rumor of little mind.<br> We did have a drink last night.<br> One?<br> -A dozen maybe.<br> And this morning you stagger<br> out of his apartment. Charming.<br> Funny thing, I don't even<br> remember going there.<br> Better than sleeping pills.<br> Can I help with anything?<br> Could I help you with anything?<br> Housework?<br> You put that coat back on.<br> Why?<br> Half-dressed women make it<br> difficult to concentrate.<br> Well, then don't.<br> Don't think of me as a woman.<br> After all, we're just<br> like brother and sister.<br> Remember?<br> You're mad at me this morning.<br> Put the coat on!<br> Why this morning?<br> Because I'm sick of seeing you<br> boozed up, burned out and ugly!<br> Sick for me or sick for you?<br> For you.<br> For everything you're wasting.<br> Why do you come here like this?<br> Where have I always come, Steve?<br> At least I can be honest with you.<br> Start being honest with yourself.<br> You're making a mess out of your life<br> and forcing me to watch it.<br> Do you want me to go?<br> -Yes!<br> For good? -Yes!<br> No.<br> It's terrible, isn't it?<br> I say "yes" too much when I shouldn't.<br> And you say "no" too much<br> when you shouldn't.<br> But you're not nearly as mad<br> as you pretend to be.<br> I try to be.<br> Hungry?<br> Ravenous.<br> Now, the problem is,<br> how do I get home?<br> Car's outside. You drive.<br> -By the way, thanks for the use of it.<br> -Anytime.<br> What I mean is, what's my mother gonna<br> think if I show up dressed like this?<br> Your mother knows everything<br> about you.<br> That may be so,<br> but we never admit it.<br> I'm still her innocent little girl.<br> And she's my dear, sweet<br> cookie-baking mother.<br> So go home, give her an innocent<br> smile and have a cookie.<br> And tell her the truth.<br> If I tell her the truth,<br> I'll have to move out.<br> That's what normally happens<br> when people grow up.<br> If I left, she'd be lonesome.<br> I'm all she has, so we have<br> to lie to each other.<br> What does your analyst say<br> about all this?<br> I only tell Dr. Tredman<br> what I think he ought to hear.<br> That's very intelligent.<br> If I were intelligent,<br> I wouldn't need a psychiatrist.<br> Listen, where am I gonna find<br> a dress to wear on Sunday?<br> How would I know?<br> Your girlfriend, Norma,<br> is almost my size.<br> You expect me to ask Norma to bring<br> her clothes over here to put on you?<br> It would certainly get me<br> out of a jam.<br> And put me in one.<br> Listen to old Gloria.<br> The greater the sacrifice<br> you ask a woman to make...<br> ...the more she knows<br> you love her. Honestly.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Norma?<br> Problems, Liggett?<br> You haven't said a word<br> since we left the city.<br> Bing...<br> ...you know three of the most<br> overrated things in this world?<br> Home loving, home cooking<br> and security.<br> That should be over<br> the doorway of The Stork Club.<br> It should be over the doorway<br> of my apartment.<br> Oh, come on, Ligg.<br> You've got everything.<br> Lots of people would envy you.<br> But am I happy?<br> Obviously not.<br> Ever wonder why?<br> I have.<br> Can you take it from<br> an old fraternity brother?<br> You're a heel.<br> A low-down, rotten heel.<br> Anything doesn't go your way,<br> anything you can't have, you destroy.<br> I've known you all these years...<br> ...and I never realized<br> you despise me.<br> If I really despised you, I could<br> never tell you what I think of you.<br> Tell me.<br> You married a lovely woman,<br> and you mistreat her...<br> ...because you blame her<br> for your life.<br> Drinking, letching and lying.<br> You won't face the truth.<br> -And what is this so-called truth?<br> -You find it out yourself.<br> -Tell me.<br> -It wouldn't be any good.<br> Go out and earn it the way<br> everybody else does.<br> The offer is still open.<br> You could come back as a law partner<br> with me anytime.<br> I wouldn't join<br> the Foreign Legion with you.<br> Pull!<br> Emily.<br> Yes, darling?<br> How's your mother?<br> She's doing well, thank you.<br> She's getting much stronger.<br> When are you coming back to town?<br> Soon as I can.<br> -Why? You getting lonesome?<br> -Sometimes.<br> The question was more one<br> of curiosity than passion.<br> Pull!<br> I have to get back to town<br> after lunch.<br> But I invited the Farleys<br> for dinner tonight.<br> My apologies to the Farleys.<br> Cliff Holbrook's in town.<br> And the court jester of the chemical<br> industry has to keep him laughing.<br> Pull!<br> As vice president<br> in charge of nonsense...<br> ...I have to keep a $6 million<br> customer happy, don't I?<br> Why don't you send someone<br> less important in the company?<br> There isn't anybody<br> less important than me.<br> Pull!<br> Darling?<br> Will you be charming<br> at the country club today?<br> I know you're always charming,<br> but will you be especially so?<br> Why?<br> I was asked if you'd consider being<br> elected to the board of governors.<br> Why me? Nobody on that board<br> is under 60.<br> Isn't that where aging,<br> useless executives go to die?<br> Maybe they want to get<br> some young blood on it.<br> Or maybe they see me as just<br> another aging, useless executive.<br> Why do you say such cruel<br> things about yourself?<br> To beat everybody, including you,<br> to the punch.<br> Pull!<br> Somebody at the cleaners<br> seems to have left a pin in it.<br> I know how embarrassed you must be.<br> I'll speak to them.<br> Really, this is terribly sweet of you.<br> Just remember that suit has led<br> a sheltered life. It shocks easily.<br> Then it's time it had<br> a little adventure.<br> By the way, just for the record,<br> what did happen to your dress?<br> Well, it's a funny thing.<br> One minute it was there...<br> ...and the next minute<br> it wasn't.<br> Much like your virtue, I presume.<br> Am I wrong?<br> Somehow...<br> ...I get the feeling<br> that you don't like me.<br> And I tried so hard to conceal it.<br> Why?<br> You're Steve's girl.<br> I'm just an old friend.<br> Well, listen, old friend,<br> it's about time...<br> Are you decent?<br> -I am. You can speak for yourself.<br> Come on in.<br> I hate to drink and run.<br> To the three of us.<br> One for all, and all for one.<br> The question is, which one?<br> Where are the keys to my car?<br> Right there, on the mantel.<br> Oh, darling, don't forget<br> to feed junior regularly.<br> Bye, now.<br> What're we gonna do?<br> -About what?<br> Me. You. Her.<br> Three mixed-up musketeers.<br> I don't understand.<br> How are you fixed for honesty?<br> Do you know how old I am?<br> Twenty-seven.<br> How long have we been,<br> what they call, going together?<br> Three years.<br> And four months.<br> It's a lot of time to put in on<br> a man who can't make up his mind.<br> What are you talking about, marriage?<br> -I didn't say that.<br> But it's Gloria or me.<br> Are you telling me<br> who I can have for friends?<br> I'm only telling you that you can't<br> kiss me, wishing I were Gloria anymore.<br> That's the stupidest...<br> -Call me when you make up your mind.<br> Shall we set a deadline?<br> New Year's Eve?<br> Wait a minute!<br> Let me get this straight.<br> You're handing me an ultimatum?<br> The first ultimatum<br> is always the hardest.<br> Goodbye and good luck.<br> Gloria, don't go like this.<br> My name is Norma.<br> Here's Gloria now.<br> From where? Girl Scout camp?<br> Do I look all right?<br> Do you have to?<br> -Hi, girls!<br> -Oh, darling!<br> You're getting circles<br> under your eyes.<br> Too much reading.<br> Dear Mrs. Thurber.<br> How's church?<br> Why don't you go sometime<br> and find out?<br> Coffee. Just what I need.<br> Not bad.<br> Now, Frances, you know Gloria's<br> always been a big coffee drinker...<br> ...ever since she was little.<br> That's a perfectly lovely suit, dear.<br> Have I seen it before?<br> I picked it up at the designer's last<br> week. Had it in the trunk of the car.<br> Must be hard changing clothes<br> in one of those foreign car trunks.<br> The model agency sent some dresses.<br> One of them they want you to wear<br> to three different places.<br> The Salvation Army, the public library<br> and the PTA in Brownsville.<br> Frances, don't joke<br> about Gloria's work.<br> It's very important to her.<br> She's one of the few girls<br> of her kind in the city.<br> I pass.<br> Did Butterfield 8 call?<br> Not today.<br> Any mail?<br> Oh, just act like I'm not here.<br> You mean I haven't been?<br> There's a card from<br> the finance company.<br> You're two weeks late<br> on your car payments.<br> Oh, it completely slipped my mind.<br> Listen, I've only got about $40.<br> Could I borrow the $35<br> until I'm paid?<br> Of course, darling.<br> I don't know what I'd do without you.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> I'll go get cleaned up<br> and do my nails.<br> Yeah, sharpen them!<br> For you, Mrs. Thurber, I would.<br> In case you forgot, your room<br> is the first one on the right.<br> Thank you.<br> Exactly where did you stay last night?<br> Oh, the penthouse at the YWCA.<br> Oh, Annie.<br> Please don't tease Gloria.<br> My daughter and my best friend<br> should appreciate each other.<br> Mama, don't be upset.<br> Every time I'm separated<br> from Mrs. Thurber...<br> ...I learn to appreciate her<br> a little bit more.<br> I return the sentiment.<br> Enjoy them in good health.<br> Thank you, Frances.<br> I spent the night<br> with Steve's girlfriend, Norma.<br> Now isn't that nice?<br> She knows a boy whose girlfriend<br> is that unselfish.<br> That's a girlfriend that won't<br> have a boyfriend long.<br> A compliment from you, Mrs. Thurber?<br> I must have said it wrong.<br> See you later.<br> Hello.<br> He's on the line?<br> Let me speak to him.<br> Mr. Liggett, I didn't think you'd<br> be foolish enough to call today.<br> But since you have...<br> Wow!<br> I haven't heard that since<br> I was in Marine boot camp.<br> But you're way out of line, honey.<br> Okay, no "honey".<br> I tore your dress last night<br> and felt I owed you a new one.<br> After all, only a fool would<br> offer pennies for a Renoir.<br> Suppose we meet again<br> at the o/d trading post?<br> I might be in the neighborhood.<br> If I am, what time<br> will you be there?<br> About 8:30?<br> I'm getting cold in my skin.<br> Goodbye.<br> Keep the change, honey.<br> -Here you are, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> May Yale go bankrupt.<br> That will take a while.<br> But here's to it.<br> We didn't talk much last night.<br> Hardly.<br> But be grateful for small favors.<br> I'm sorry about the money.<br> Forgotten!<br> Hey, you're with me, kid.<br> Remember?<br> By choice, only.<br> You're all alike, aren't you?<br> Play tough.<br> I'm not like anyone. I'm me.<br> -That's right.<br> I shouldn't knock it, should I?<br> You know...<br> ...last night you were great company.<br> I've spent time around and about.<br> I didn't ask for your credits<br> last night.

Sit down.<br> I want to make a point.<br> All right.<br> We've had sacrifice and cowardice...<br> ...honor and infidelity...<br> ...courage, love...<br> ...deception, confusion, brilliance...<br> ...tragedy.<br> -Why not just bring the dictionary?<br> You know what we've never had in the<br> family since its history's been recorded?<br> Privacy.<br> There's not one single,<br> solitary divorce.<br> It's my opinion, after 150 years,<br> we've earned...<br> ...a divorce with a clear conscience.<br> Tomorrow, I want you<br> to call Mr. Robinson...<br> ...and instruct him to draw up<br> the necessary papers...<br> ...and to have them served<br> forthwith on that...<br> ...worthless,<br> absentee husband of yours.<br> -He is not worthless.<br> -Then why isn't he with you?<br> Mother, you were ill.<br> I wanted to look after you.<br> You wanted to hide from<br> unpleasantness and the truth.<br> Somewhere, at this very minute, he's<br> probably lifting a glass in a bar...<br> ...or some woman's skirt.<br> And you know it.<br> Oh, Mother, don't be vulgar!<br> Vulgarity has its uses.<br> Anyway, your marriage is over.<br> Divorce him without delay...<br> ...and start out fresh.<br> -No.<br> Never.<br> This is not pride speaking,<br> but because I know Wes is good.<br> And I love him. -Oh, nonsense!<br> -Now, Mother, you listen to me.<br> If there's anything wrong with Wes,<br> we brought it about.<br> Explain.<br> Instead of my living his life,<br> we brought him here to ours.<br> We handed him a gift-wrapped<br> package and said:<br> "Here. Here's your life.<br> Don't bother to live it yourself".<br> You presented him with a meaningless<br> job, all title and no work.<br> He woke up with energy to burn,<br> and he started burning it.<br> But in all the wrong directions:<br> Liquor, women, defiance.<br> The more he did it, the more<br> he had to go on to justify it.<br> You're not running a mission<br> for lost egos.<br> Mother, I'm running a marriage.<br> Not just through the good days,<br> but through the bad days too.<br> Someday Wes is going to find himself.<br> When he does, I want to be there.<br> In the meantime?<br> All I need is patience.<br> How much have you got left?<br> I don't know, Mother.<br> That's what scares me.<br> I don't know.<br> You're a magnificent woman, Emily.<br> Magnificent.<br> But why don't you fight for him?<br> A knock-down, drag-out kind of fight.<br> And give him all the more reason<br> to run away from me?<br> Emily...<br> ...where did you ever learn<br> all this wisdom?<br> From you, you fool!<br> That attach case, a man would<br> love that, wouldn't he?<br> Any man.<br> Especially if the right woman<br> gave it to him.<br> I know the right woman<br> and the right man.<br> Let's buy it.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning.<br> -I'd like to see that attach case.<br> The one in tan.<br> -This one?<br> Very nice.

That's the business<br> I wouldn't mind having again.<br> What're you talking about?<br> -Come on, Liggett. Come on.<br> Gloria!<br> Sure.<br> She's frantic, isn't she?<br> Like a rocket right off the Earth.<br> Who should know better<br> than yours truly?<br> Mother, help me.<br> I'd have left home for that.<br> She's got a traveling itch<br> like a flea.<br> Hop, hop, hop. One dog to another.<br> She picks you up, and she drops you.<br> Well, welcome to the fraternity.<br> We meet once a year in Yankee Stadium.<br> Now, listen, Butterfield 8...<br> ...I've called her hundreds of times.<br> I'm her closest friend.<br> You've got to tell me where she is.<br> It's a matter of life and death!<br> You're liars.<br> Liars, all of you!<br> Thieves and liars!<br> Now tell me!<br> Do you know the speed limit here?<br> -No.<br> posted every half-mile.<br> Do you know how fast you were going?<br> -No.<br> Let me see your license, please.<br> Thank you.<br> Turn your face around toward me.<br> Now breathe out.<br> Thank you.<br> You got troubled?<br> Yes.<br> -I thought so.<br> Let me give you some advice.<br> Don't try to drive your troubles away.<br> First, you're gonna be<br> mad at the world.<br> You push your foot down on that<br> gas pedal, and then you go.<br> Tomorrow, the sun will come out<br> like it did this morning.<br> Take it easy.<br> Cookies.<br> So what was I saying?<br> So she said to herself,<br> "You get in solid with the director.<br> He puts you in solid<br> with the producer.<br> You wind up with a big partnership".<br> So two days, or should I say,<br> two nights later...<br> ...she was in, butt solid.<br> Yeah, with the director,<br> with his cousin...<br> She was so busy being in solid with<br> every Tom, Dick, Harry and George...<br> ...she wouldn't recognize a producer<br> if one was under her pillow.<br> Do you take sugar?<br> So now time passes,<br> and our heroine is very big.<br> Yeah, but not in the theater.<br> No, in all the wrong places.<br> In 500 little black books...<br> ...28 divorce cases...<br> ...two police blotters and one<br> restraining sheet in Bellevue's ward.<br> Are you sure?<br> Yeah, she hit it big.<br> From a size 12 dress to a size 44.<br> She went from looking<br> like an orchid...<br> ...to a face like a pan of worms.<br> And all because...<br> ...she said, "With only a rag,<br> a bone, a hank of hair...<br> ...I will move the world my way!"<br> What's the matter? I'm boring you?<br> You live it up.<br> You kick up your heels.<br> You grab everything you can get.<br> "You light the candle from one end<br> to the other," like they say.<br> And then one day, you too can be...<br> ...the proud proprietor...<br> ...of a very heavily mortgaged,<br> roadside brothel...<br> ...and wish you were dead.<br> Good morning, darling.<br> What time did you get in last night?<br> -Late.<br> Did the private detective have any...?<br> Detective?<br> The man you'll see about the coat.<br> -Oh, him.<br> He was on a job.<br> I'm gonna see him again today.<br> I've seen you drink...<br> ...many times, but never<br> in the morning like this.<br> Don't worry, Emily.<br> It's not alcoholism.<br> It's just a kind of medicine.<br> Why don't you go back to bed?<br> I can't.<br> I have to go and look<br> for your fur coat.<br> Why do you feel so responsible?<br> It disappeared while I was here.<br> -No one's blaming you.<br> That's not the point.<br> -What is?<br> I could tell you things about<br> people, but never mind.<br> You have enough problems of your own.<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> -Yes.<br> When I come back with that coat, which<br> I will, I want you to throw me out.<br> Hi, Mama.<br> -Hello, darling.<br> That looks pretty.<br> You might like it for your bathroom.<br> -I would.<br> I'm sorry I didn't<br> come home last night.<br> That's all right.<br> I spent the night in a motel.<br> Alone.<br> I had some thinking to do.<br> I saw a woman.<br> Utterly proper,<br> utterly conventional...<br> ...utterly beautiful.<br> You're beautiful too, dear.<br> I have a face.<br> That's not the kind of beauty I mean.<br> -What kind of beauty?<br> The kind that comes<br> from self-respect, I guess.<br> It shines.<br> -I've seen that kind.<br> It takes a lifetime to find.<br> -I'm going to find it.<br> I think you will.<br> Butterfield 8 called.<br> Any messages?<br> Mr. Liggett says he has to see you.<br> It's a matter of life and death.<br> Did he say when or where?<br> I've written it down.<br> So you did take it.<br> Yes. And I'm sorry, Liggett.<br> May I sit down?<br> That's up to you, honey.<br> Would you care to order something?<br> -No, the lady's not going to order.<br> Why did you bother to bring it back?<br> Because it isn't mine.<br> Because you're scared, you mean.<br> Because you know I'm not an ordinary<br> Joe on your sleigh ride.<br> Because you know, while I might<br> have given you the world...<br> ...I'd tear your head off if you<br> stole as much as a nickel from me.<br> Isn't that it?<br> No.<br> So you pick up the man<br> when you want...<br> ...and drop him like a bomb...<br> ...when you want.<br> Get lost! We're talking!<br> People don't mean anything to you,<br> do they?<br> The way they feel in here.<br> Not down where you live.<br> I care about some people.<br> For an hour or a day or a week.<br> Till you've had your kicks.<br> Then you slither off to the next one.<br> I'll talk to you tomorrow.<br> There isn't gonna be any tomorrow.<br> And for once,<br> somebody's going to drop you.<br> Go ahead, try that heel trick again.<br> The one that gets the boys hot.<br> And I'll rip this arm right out!<br> May I say something?<br> -Sure...<br> ...honey, babe, dollface, kid.<br> Say something sexy!<br> Something that always got the boys<br> headed for the motel.<br> You can't have everything in life.<br> Be grateful for the few things you do<br> get, no matter where they come from.<br> The pornographic philosopher!<br> Now, you just sit there<br> like a good tramp should...<br> ...until I get out of your sight.<br> I can't stomach being seen<br> in public with you.<br> Liggett.<br> And don't you dare<br> mention my name again!<br> You're a dirty joke, from one<br> end of this town to the other!<br> That will be enough of that.<br> -Mind your own business!<br> Now, look.<br> -Take it easy.<br> There's other women in this place,<br> including my wife.<br> Hey! Take it easy, pal! Come on!<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> I just must have<br> gone berserk, I guess.<br> He's gonna be all right.<br> I'm awfully sorry, miss.<br> Can I help you?<br> Mr. Liggett!<br> Good heavens, what happened?<br> -Get away.<br> Liggett?<br> For a lousy fur coat, you'd do this?<br> You want me to give this back<br> to my wife after you touched it?<br> Leave me alone.<br> Do you want a doctor?<br> Yes, and tell him to make me<br> unconscious before I can think.<br> Who is it?<br> Who is it?<br> It's me.<br> Can I get you anything?<br> Ask me about the coat, Steve.<br> Ask me.<br> I see you still have it.<br> Because it's mine.<br> Every skin.<br> Every thread.<br> Every hair is mine.<br> And do you know why?<br> Why?<br> Because I earned it.<br> Pretty good pay for one week.<br> $ 1000 in fur a day.<br> You and Liggett couldn't make it?<br> That isn't the important thing now.<br> The important thing is, Steve...<br> ...I took money.<br> Do you know what that makes me?<br> -Baby, don't.<br> Let me cry.<br> Let me cry!<br> Like all the times I should have...<br> ...and never could.<br> I have to tell you something.<br> I know all about you, Gloria.<br> -You don't know this.<br> Nobody knows this...<br> ...except a certain man somewhere...<br> ...who I'd like to think of as standing<br> in a lake filled with burning gasoline.<br> Please, listen.<br> I was 13.<br> My father was dead.<br> All older men seemed<br> like fathers to me.<br> But I wanted one of my own...<br> ...to sit in his lap...<br> ...to hug him...<br> ...and have him say I was beautiful.<br> Do you remember Major Hartley?<br> I remember him.<br> Major Hartley.<br> My mother's friend.<br> He came down to Grand Central Station<br> one day to pick me up from camp.<br> Mother was away visiting.<br> He took me home.<br> He let me sit on his lap.<br> He let me hug him.<br> He told me I was beautiful.<br> He stayed in that house<br> for one week...<br> ...and taught me more about evil than<br> any 13-year-old girl in the world knew.<br> Don't.<br> You haven't heard the worst of it yet!<br> I loved it!<br> Every awful moment of it, I loved!<br> That's your Gloria, Steve!<br> That's your darling Gloria!<br> I made a way of life out of it.<br> The deep shame of it didn't<br> hit me until it was too late.<br> I couldn't go back to 13 again.<br> I had one chance to stop it.<br> One last chance.<br> And I...<br> ...I threw it...<br> ...all away for 32 animals...<br> ...sewn together in a coat.<br> It's not all over.<br> Give it another chance.<br> Where you going?<br> -It doesn't matter.<br> -Wait!<br> It matters a great deal,<br> what you do.<br> You've got to decide<br> what you're gonna do next.<br> I do too.<br> Stay here tonight.<br> Thank you, Steve.<br> Anything you need?<br> There is. A divorce.<br> There's no call for such remorse<br> over last night.<br> Let's face it, Emily.<br> I'm a failure as a husband<br> and as a man.<br> Wes, I love you!<br> I know you do.<br> That makes the divorce<br> all the more necessary...<br> ...because I can't go on<br> disappointing you.<br> Couldn't you try?<br> -No.<br> Do you love her?<br> That woman you were with.<br> -I seem to.<br> But you fought over her<br> and sent her away in a rage.<br> Yes, I did.<br> I was sick because I was afraid<br> I was going to lose her.<br> I hated her unreasonably because<br> I couldn't stand losing her.<br> Just as you hate me now.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning, sweetheart.<br> Open your eyes good and make sure<br> you know who you're talking to.<br> Norma, isn't it?<br> -Shrewd guess.<br> I wanna marry you today.<br> I haven't anything else to do.<br> Good. I'll be ready in a minute.<br> Fine. Thank you very much.<br> Okay. Bye.<br> I've just called Butterfield 8<br> to shut off the service...<br> ...and to send me a bill.<br> As soon as I have an address in<br> Boston, will you forward it to me?<br> Yes, dear, I will.<br> Take care of Mama.<br> I've got plans for her.<br> My cousin Harry.<br> Oh, Frances!<br> -I'm a born matchmaker.<br> -Naturally!<br> I don't want to be a nosy<br> neighbor, but why Boston?<br> That's where the Pilgrims<br> made a fresh start.<br> If it's good enough for them,<br> I can take it.<br> Can Boston take you?<br> What will you do in Boston, dear?<br> Well, I'll buy a paper.<br> Look up the want ads.<br> Same as any girl without a job.<br> Before we all start crying,<br> let's get the luggage in the car.<br> This is as close<br> as I'll ever get to heaven.<br> Do you like it?<br> Of course not. I'm only faint<br> from not eating in three days.<br> It's yours.<br> No.<br> Wear it in good health.<br> Oh, no.<br> You can't bribe me with this.<br> I could never say a mean word about<br> you ever again. I'd die of boredom.<br> Well, then just keep it warm for me.<br> Goodbye, Mama.<br> I don't want you to go.<br> I have a feeling<br> you'll never come back.<br> I never will come back, Mama.<br> But I'll send for you<br> as soon as I can.<br> Did she leave any forwarding<br> address or number?<br> Now, look...<br> ...this is the most important<br> telephone call of my life.<br> You must tell me, please.<br> Boston?<br> You're certain?<br> Thank you, Butterfield 8.<br> Thanks.<br> Don't be frightened, Gloria. Please.<br> I can only think of one apology.<br> Will you marry me?<br> I've arranged for a divorce.<br> Wait for me and...<br> ...I'll make you forget every word<br> I uttered last night.<br> You can't.<br> I'm left with those words.<br> I'm branded with them.<br> Thank you for asking me to marry you.<br> If only you'd done it yesterday,<br> it might have meant something.<br> But not today.<br> But I only did<br> what I did last night...<br> ...because you were so much<br> in my blood that I exploded.<br> But you were right last night.<br> No man could marry me...<br> ...and not keep remembering.<br> You'd have to explode<br> at my life, past and...<br> You couldn't help but explode.<br> I can think of a dozen apologies.<br> Oh, I know.<br> And I'd accept.<br> But then look.<br> Look at all the thousands<br> of explosions ahead...<br> ...and the thousands<br> of apologies and acceptances...<br> ...until we both got so disgusted.<br> -I love you. I love you.<br> And I love you.<br> It's no use. It's no damn use.<br> Let's go someplace to talk.<br> Over at Happy's.<br> Just talk. Just so that we can be<br> together and alone.<br> So that I can tell you<br> what I want to do.<br> If I get in a room with you...<br> ...together, alone...<br> ...I know what will happen.<br> It'll be the same thing<br> all over again.<br> We started this whole thing together.<br> We're obligated to solve it together.<br> Please.<br> Hello, Mr. Liggett.<br> You brought another weary traveler.<br> Hi, honey.<br> Welcome home.<br> Give me a key, Happy.<br> -Keys, that's my business.<br> Here pass the most beautiful...<br> -Give me a key.<br> Yeah, yeah. Right away.<br> You saw the accident?<br> Yes.<br> Your name, please.<br> Weston Liggett.<br> I stopped that same girl for speeding.<br> I wish I'd put her in jail then.<br> They didn't make her name yet?<br> -No.<br> Gloria Wandrous.<br> -You knew her?<br> We were traveling north...<br> ...together.<br> You're going to read about it<br> in the newspapers tomorrow.<br> The family name...<br> ...your picture, my picture...<br> ...everything.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't understand. What's happened?<br> Tell me. -She's dead.<br> She lived for an hour unconscious.<br> -But she's dead. -Who?<br> That girl? -Yes.<br> -Terrible. -Automobile accident.<br> She was trying to get<br> away from me.<br> I'm sorry. So sorry.<br> I don't suppose that anybody would<br> think that she was a good person.<br> But, strangely enough, she was.<br> On the surface, she was all<br> sex and devil-may-care.<br> Yet everything in her was<br> struggling toward respectability.<br> She never gave up trying.<br> I'm going out looking for my pride.<br> Alone.<br> When I find it, if you're here,<br> I'll come back.<br> And we'll see if it still has<br> any value to either of us.<br> Adaptation and technical<br> correction: kocijan<br>
