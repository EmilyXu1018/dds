                        This is a tale about<br> an unprejudiced heart...<br> and how it changed our valley forever.<br> There was a time not so long ago...<br> when pigs were afforded no<br> respect except by other pigs.<br> They lived their whole lives<br> in a cruel and sunless world.<br> In those days, pigs believed that<br> the sooner they grew large and fat,<br> the sooner they'd be<br> taken into pig paradise.<br> - Haa! Haa! Get up!<br> - A place so wonderful...<br> - that no pig had ever thought to come back.<br> - Yo! Yeah!<br> Good-bye, Mom.<br> So when the day came for their parents to<br> go to that other world of endless pleasures,<br> it was not a time for<br> young pigs to be sad.<br> Just another step towards the day<br> when they, too, would make the journey.<br> Perhaps it was because he was alone.<br> Perhaps his sadness<br> made him easier to catch.<br> Whatever the reason, of the thousands<br> of animals in the piggery that day...<br> only one was chosen.<br> - How's this one, Harry?<br> - Just right for the purpose.<br> - How much do I owe you?<br> - It's a runt, Harry. A worthless, little runt.<br> You're too modest, Esme Hoggett.<br> Nine out of ten first prizes<br> for jams and jellies...<br> is more than a matter of luck.<br> Luck still plays its part. Our<br> berries were wickedly good this year.<br> And our water is very tasty too.<br> Of course, we don't use the town water.<br> Arthur Hoggett! How's it going, Arthur?<br> How are those sheep of<br> yours? Come on, try your luck.<br> How about taking a guess,<br> Arthur? All for a good cause.<br> - Don't keep pigs.<br> - Christmas day. Think of it. What a feast!<br> That'll do, Pig.<br> The pig and the farmer<br> regarded each other.<br> And for a fleeting moment,<br> something passed between them.<br> - A faint sense of some common destiny.<br> - Hah. Strange.<br> First time the little thing<br> hasn't screamed its head off.<br> Now you'll have to have a guess.<br> Sixteen pounds, five-<br> Eew.<br> Two ounces.<br> Hooey! Hoggett!<br> Hooey! Hoggett!<br> Thanks, Arthur. We'll be<br> weighing the little pig tomorrow.<br> We'll phone you if you win.<br> When you win, Arthur. When you win!<br> Care to guess the pig's weight, sir?<br> Support the Lion's Club.<br> Ooh!<br> What could we do with<br> a pig, eh, Duchess?<br> Just think. Two nice<br> hams. Two sides of bacon.<br> Oh, and pork chops, kidney,<br> liver, chitlins, pickle his feet.<br> - Save his blood for black<br> puddin'. There's the telephone.<br> Hoggett!<br> Good news, Arthur. You've won the pig.<br> Oh.<br> Pigs are definitely stupid.<br> Oh, oh, oh, oh.<br> - What is it, Mom?<br> - That's a pig.<br> - They'll eat him when he's big.<br> - Will they eat us?<br> Good heavens, no! The bosses<br> only eat stupid animals...<br> like sheep and ducks and chickens.<br> Yea!<br> It does look stupid, Mom.<br> Not as stupid as sheep, mind you.<br> But pigs are definitely stupid.<br> Excuse me. No, we're not.<br> - Good heavens! Who are you?<br> - I'm a Large White.<br> - Yes, that's your breed, dear. What's your name?<br> - I don't know.<br> What did your mother call you to tell<br> you apart from your brothers and sisters?<br> Our mom called us all the same.<br> And what was that, dear?<br> She called us all Babe.<br> Perhaps we shouldn't talk<br> too much about, uh, family.<br> I want my mom.<br> There, there. You've got<br> to be a brave boy now.<br> I left my mother when I was your age,<br> and my pups will have to leave me soon.<br> But I'll keep an eye on you, if you<br> like, just 'til you find your feet.<br> The little pig's a bit low.<br> He's going to sleep with us...<br> just 'til he finds his feet.<br> Until he finds his feet.<br> But, Mom, he'll wet the bed!<br> Nonsense!<br> If you do want to do anything,<br> you'll go outside, won't you?<br> Good boy.<br> Yea!<br> Yeah! Yeah! Stomp on him!<br> What's your name, Pig?<br> - What does he taste like?<br> - Where did he come from?<br> Comin' through! Hey, get lost!<br> We've got to do<br> something about that duck.<br> Ooh! Ooh!<br> Doodle-loo-dee-doo.<br> - What's that noise?<br> - It's only Ferdinand.<br> - What's Ferdinand?<br> - He's a duck.<br> - He wants to be a rooster.<br> - He hates being a duck.<br> - We'll catch him one day and eat him. Won't we, Mom?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> Yech! Who'd want to eat a duck?<br> Babe, you wait here.<br> - Aren't pigs allowed?<br> - Not live ones.<br> - Sorry, dear. Only dogs and cats inside the house.<br> - Why?<br> That's just the way things are.<br> Whoa!<br> - Ow! -<br> Pig-pig-piggy!<br> Ooh, what a spectacular<br> feast I've got for you.<br> Oh, yes! What a lucky<br> little pork chop you are.<br> Delicious! Oh, yes! Yum, yum, yum.<br> Who's gonna grow up<br> to be a big, fat pig?<br> You are! You are! Yum, yum, yum.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - To work with the sheep.<br> - What's sheep?<br> - Sheep is animals with thick, woolly coats.<br> And thick woolly heads. And men<br> can't look after them without us.<br> - Why do they need us?<br> 'Cause we're sheepdogs! Yea!<br> - Not you, dear.<br> - Why not?<br> We have to do dogs' work. You're a pig.<br> Your job is to stay here and eat your food.<br> We'll be back at the end of the day.<br> They don't think I'll<br> remember. Well, I don't forget.<br> Seems like a sheep's<br> just born to suffer.<br> Hello? Excuse me.<br> Darn wolf!<br> - I'm not a wolf. I'm a pig. What are you?<br> - Ewe.<br> Pig. What are you?<br> I'm a ewe. A ewe!<br> - You're a sheep!<br> - I'll not be called a common sheep, thank you kindly.<br> I'm a Border Leicester<br> ewe. The name's Maa.<br> Oh.<br> - What's wrong with you, Maa?<br> - Foot rot. And I got me a nasty cough.<br> And I'm not as young as I used to be.<br> Hmph.<br> - Seem like a nice young pig. What be your name?<br> - Babe.<br> Not like them wolves. Treat<br> you like dirt, they do!<br> - Bite you as soon as look at you, those savages!<br> - Bite you?<br> And worse. Some wolves be so bad,<br> they run a sheep down<br> and tear it to pieces.<br> Fly would never do that!<br> Fly, is it? A right vicious<br> creature she be, I'll tell you.<br> - Not Fly.<br> - All them wolves is cruel to sheep. Always have been.<br> Brutal savages! That's what they be.<br> I wouldn't want to see a gentle soul<br> like you mixin' with the likes of them.<br> That afternoon when he saw Fly,<br> the pig's mind was a<br> tangle of questions.<br> Cruel, vicious, brutal?<br> What was it that dogs<br> did in the fields all day?<br> - Hello, Babe? Had a good day?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> The old sheep had to be wrong about Fly.<br> And the pig promised himself that he would<br> never think badly of any creature ever again.<br> Crime and Punishment!<br> The morning of the terrible crime...<br> started like any other on Hoggett Farm.<br> Comin' through! Comin' through!<br> Take off!<br> - Now!<br> - Up, up, up.<br> Nee-nee-nee-nee.<br> Hmm?<br> I was worried it might have a harsh tone,<br> but that's quite a nice musical ring.<br> I walked into O'Halloran's Hardware,<br> and there it was waiting for me.<br> What a splendid way to<br> wake up each morning!<br> Hoggett, dear. Church.<br> When embarking on an audacious crime,<br> a duck needs a willing accomplice.<br> A creature who is<br> reliable, beyond suspicion,<br> and above all, extremely gullible.<br> Hey! Psst!<br> Wha<br> - What?<br> You look like an intelligent,<br> sophisticated, discerning young fella.<br> - Who, me?<br> - Yeah. Follow me. Oh, boy! Are you in for some fun!<br> What are we doin'? Where are we goin'?<br> Now the duck knew<br> exactly what he had to do.<br> - The alarm clock had to go. His very life depended on it.<br> - Do you see it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good.<br> So I go through the kitchen,<br> across the living room...<br> - Good, good.<br> - into the bedroom.<br> Get the mechanical rooster<br> and bring it out to you.<br> - What about that cat?<br> - But quietly bring it out to you.<br> - Excellent.<br> - I don't think I can do it.<br> It's against the rules. Only dogs<br> and cats allowed in the house.<br> It's a good rule, but this is bigger<br> than rules. This is life and death.<br> - It is? -<br> Mm-hmm. Follow me.<br> Hello! Look, there's<br> something you should know.<br> - Humans eat ducks!<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> Most ducks prefer to forget it, but the<br> fact is that humans like to eat plump ducks.<br> I don't think so. Not the<br> boss. Not the boss's wife.<br> Come on. Humans don't eat cats. Why?<br> - Well, they're- - They're<br> indispensable. They catch mice.<br> Humans don't eat roosters. Why? They make eggs<br> with the hens and wake up everyone in the morning.<br> I tried it with the<br> hens. It didn't work.<br> So I turned to crowing,<br> and lo! I discover my gift.<br> But no sooner do I become indispensable<br> than they bring in a machine to do the job!<br> Ah, the treachery of it!<br> - A mechanical rooster!<br> - Oh, dear me.<br> Oh, dear you?<br> I suppose the life<br> of an anorexic duck...<br> doesn't amount to much in<br> the broad scheme of things.<br> But, Pig,<br> I'm all I've got.<br> Why do you need me to do it?<br> - I'm allergic to cats.<br> - Oh.<br> They make me sneeze.<br> Ahh.<br> Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.<br> My life is in your hands.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Oh, no!<br> Ah, boy.<br> No, no, no!<br> Your foot, your foot! Take<br> the string off your foot.<br> Wait, wait. Let me put it<br> this way. Stop. Turn around-<br> Shh.<br> No, no! The other way! Turn-<br> No, stop! Oh!<br> Stop! Stop, stop, stop!<br> Don't, don't, stupid. Go outside... now.<br> - But you said you can't do without me.<br> - I can. Trust me, I can.<br> - Are you sure? You're positive?<br> - Yes!<br> - Go outside and stand guard.<br> - Okay. Good idea.<br> Oh, boy. Want something done,<br> you gotta do it yourself.<br> - Hmm.<br> - Guard against what?<br> Ahh! Ahh! Don't worry.<br> Stick with me and please, I<br> beg you, not one more word.<br> All right.<br> Aah-<br> Don't sneeze, Ferdie.<br> - Just hold your<br> breath. - Ahhh-<br> Ah-choo!<br> It was my mistake. I was trying<br> to loosen things up a little.<br> But, no. Today proves<br> that it doesn't work.<br> From now on, we'll<br> all respect the rules.<br> To each creature its own destiny.<br> Every animal in its proper place.<br> And a pig's proper place is under<br> the old cart, not in the barn.<br> And absolutely never in the house.<br> - Is that understood?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Now, Pig, regarding the<br> company you keep. Being young,<br> it's hard to discriminate,<br> so I'll make it easy for you.<br> I forbid you to talk<br> to or consort with...<br> that duck... ever.<br> - Have I made myself clear?<br> - Uh... what's "consort"?<br> It means, young man,<br> that you must not go<br> anywhere near that duck.<br> As for the fugitive duck, when he<br> shows himself, let him know this:<br> Being a duck he must behave like a duck.<br> No more of this crowing and nonsense.<br> He should accept what he<br> is and be thankful for it.<br> - That goes for all of us.<br> - Here, here!<br> Rex continued long into the night.<br> Elsewhere, there was more talk.<br> The subject was Christmas dinner...<br> and whether that year the main<br> course would be roast pork...<br> or Duck a l'Orange.<br> And pork is a nice, sweet meat.<br> Then there's the crackling. That<br> always adds interest and texture.<br> Get him!<br> Get the pig! Get the pig! Get the pig!<br> Get him! Get him!<br> - Psst!<br> - Ferdinand!<br> - Everyone's been looking for you.<br> - Shh. Shh.<br> - What is this place?<br> - What's happenin' out there?<br> Rex isn't very happy.<br> Boy, all these new rules!<br> I'm not allowed to<br> - Oops.<br> Not allowed to what?<br> Huh?<br> - Piggy!<br> - What? You didn't see me, all right?<br> And I didn't see you. All right? Oops.<br> The time comes for all creatures...<br> when childhood ends...<br> and the doorway opens<br> to life as an adult.<br> And so it was with Fly's pups.<br> Though that time was<br> all too soon for Fly.<br> Puppy, puppy, puppy. Come on.<br> In my pocket.<br> Fly?<br> May I call you Mom?<br> And so it was that the pig...<br> found his place in<br> the world of the farm.<br> And he was happy, even in his dreams.<br> - Hello!<br> - Folks, how are you? Merry Christmas!<br> How's my favorite girl?<br> Nanny's got a jellybean.<br> Give us a kiss.<br> Guess what we're having<br> for Christmas dinner.<br> - Roast pork.<br> - I hate pork.<br> Darn silly carry-on, if you ask me.<br> The cat says they call it Christmas.<br> Christmas! Christmas dinner, yeah.<br> Dinner means death.<br> Death means carnage!<br> Christmas means carnage!<br> Christmas means carnage!<br> Oooh.<br> Yes!<br> Wait.<br> Eatin' pigs! Blaah! Barbarians!<br> You're goin' back to the fields, Maa.<br> Oh, young'un, tragic there<br> ain't more of your kind.<br> - I'll be thinkin' of ya always.<br> - I could come visit you.<br> I'd like that, but-<br> Well, we shouldn't<br> hope for too much. Ooh!<br> And so, it was Christmas Eve.<br> And time had run out for the pig.<br> - Are you doing him tonight then?<br> - Mmm.<br> Good. The blood'll drain by morning.<br> - Pity.<br> - What's that?<br> Nothin'.<br> What on earth are you babbling on about?<br> Shame to miss out on the best ham<br> prize at next year's fair, is all.<br> Nice plump haunches he's gettin'.<br> Beautiful. Still...<br> silly to wait, I suppose.<br> Here it is!<br> - The bird.<br> - Yuck. Chicken?<br> No, it's Duck a l'Orange.<br> And, Mother, it looks absolutely superb.<br> - I'm not going to eat any of it!<br> - This is fabulous.<br> Ferdinand!<br> If you're out here, who's that in there?<br> Her name's Rosanna.<br> Why Rosanna?<br> - She had such a beautiful nature.<br> - Oh, Ferdinand.<br> - I can't take it anymore.<br> - Really!<br> The fear's too much for a<br> duck. It eats away at the soul.<br> There must be kinder dispositions<br> in far-off gentler lands.<br> The only way you'll find<br> happiness is to accept...<br> that the way things are<br> is the way things are.<br> The way things are stinks! I'm<br> not gonna be a goner. I'm gone.<br> I wish all of you the best of luck.<br> - Where will you go?<br> - No idea.<br> But I'm a clever duck. I<br> could do with an adventure.<br> - I'll miss you, Ferdie.<br> - Ferdie? No one's ever called me that before.<br> Hey, good luck, Pig. Huh?<br> - I am outta here.<br> - Bye, bye.<br> Ow! Would you do me a favor, old thing?<br> - Anything.<br> - Open the gate, huh?<br> Ah! Ah! Ahh!<br> Ha-ha-ha! Whoa!<br> The pig knew it was against<br> the rules to leave the farm.<br> But something was definitely wrong.<br> How lovely, darling. What is it?<br> It's a fax machine. You can<br> send us letters by phone.<br> - Hmm.<br> - Oh.<br> At any other time, the pig<br> would've been tickled pink...<br> by his first visit to the sheep fields.<br> But now there was fear in the air.<br> Maa and her kind were under threat.<br> Hey, Frank, feel like<br> pork for dinner tonight?<br> - Young'un, you're alive!<br> - Maa!<br> What's happening? Who are these men?<br> I'll get him out. Come around, Sniff!<br> Where's our boss? It doesn't seem right.<br> - What's wrong, dear?<br> - It's the wrong one!<br> I want the house I<br> saw on the television!<br> Oh, there, there.<br> Get! Quick! Get the dog in.<br> Out of the sheep! Come on!<br> Let's go!<br> Good dog.<br> Good pig.<br> Oooh.<br> Oooh!<br> - Hey, hey. Dad says his little porker's a watch pig.<br> - Dearie me!<br> If it's not a duck that<br> thinks it's a rooster,<br> it's a pig that thinks it's a dog!<br> A pig that thinks it's a dog!<br> A pig that thinks it's a dog!<br> A washing machine, a<br> radio, a new alarm clock.<br> I think it's a lovely fax machine,<br> darling, but can't you use it?<br> We already have one, Mom.<br> That's the whole idea.<br> We can send faxes to each other.<br> Don't be afraid of it<br> just because it's new.<br> These accounts are a real worry, Arthur.<br> Every month your expenditure<br> is greater than your income.<br> It's eating up your reserves.<br> You need to modernize, get<br> some sort of cash flow going.<br> You're still using a horse<br> and cart, for God's sakes.<br> - Dad?<br> - Funny, that.<br> - What?<br> - Those chickens, that pig.<br> What's the pig got to do with anything?<br> Nothing.<br> Just look at them. The<br> browns and the whites.<br> Come, Rex. Come, Fly.<br> Come, Pig.<br> Come, Pig!<br> Perhaps he's pleased with you<br> for what you did yesterday.<br> - I didn't do much.<br> - If it wasn't for you, dear,<br> they could've stolen the whole flock.<br> - Is Rex unhappy with me?<br> - Oh, he'll be all right.<br> Just stay out of his way today.<br> Way to be, Fly. Rex, come by.<br> That'll do.<br> You're so quick. I'd never<br> be able to fly like you can.<br> Pigs aren't built to fly, dear.<br> But speed isn't the<br> thing. It's attitude.<br> They just have to know who's boss.<br> Out you go.<br> Mmm!<br> Get 'em up, Pig.<br> - He wants you to drive them out of the yard.<br> - Away to me, Pig.<br> Remember, you have to dominate them.<br> Do that and they'll do<br> anything you want. Go.<br> Woof!<br> Woof, woof, woof!<br> Woof! Woof! Woof, woof, woof, woof!<br> Woof, woof, woof!<br> This is ridiculous, Mom.<br> Nonsense. It's only your first try.<br> But you're treating them like equals.<br> They're sheep. They're inferior.<br> - Ah, no they're not.<br> - Of course they are!<br> We are their masters. Let them doubt it<br> for a second and they'll walk all over you.<br> - Fly, get that pig out of there.<br> - Make them feel inferior. Abuse them. Insult them.<br> - But they'll laugh at me.<br> - Then bite them.<br> Be ruthless. Whatever it<br> takes. Bend them to your will.<br> - Enough!<br> - Go on! Go!<br> Move along there, you-<br> You, uh, big butt heads!<br> - Ow!<br> - Young'un, stop this nonsense.<br> What's got into you? I just finished<br> tellin' what a nice young pig you be.<br> Maa, I was just trying to be a sheepdog.<br> Hah! Enough wolves in<br> the world already...<br> without a nice lad<br> like you turnin' nasty.<br> You haven't got it in ya, young'un.<br> You and I are descended<br> from the great sheepdogs.<br> We carry the bloodline<br> of the Ancient Bahou.<br> We stand for something.<br> And today I watched in shame<br> as all that was betrayed.<br> - Rex, he's just a little pig.<br> - All the greater the insult.<br> I'm sorry I bit you. Are you all right?<br> I wouldn't call that a bite, myself. You<br> got teeth in that floppy mouth or just gums?<br> You see, ladies, a heart of gold.<br> Ahh. Heart of gold.<br> No need for all this<br> wolf nonsense, young'un.<br> All a nice little pig<br> like you need do is ask.<br> Thanks very much. It<br> was very kind of you.<br> - A pleasure.<br> - What a nice little pig!<br> All right, how did you do it?<br> I asked them, and they did<br> it. I asked them nicely.<br> We don't ask sheep, dear.<br> We tell them what to do.<br> I did, Mom. They were really friendly.<br> Maybe Rex might be a little more<br> friendly if I had a talk with him.<br> No, no, no. You better leave that to me.<br> Rex?<br> I know it was hard for you today...<br> watching all that happening.<br> But surely it's not<br> worth all this misery.<br> Please, dear, not on<br> such a beautiful night.<br> You put these ideas into his head!<br> Two-faced<br> traitorous wret-<br> Get down!<br> Down, Rex. Fly!<br> A dark cloud had<br> descended on the valley.<br> And the pig felt that the<br> troubles were all his fault.<br> But he was certain that he knew<br> how to put things right again.<br> Oh, uh, e<br> - excuse me, sir.<br> But I-I-I think<br> all this trouble-<br> Well, it's not distemper.<br> Can't be rabies.<br> Must be the hormones.<br> - What about Hoggett's notion, the dog jealous of the wee pig?<br> - I don't see that myself.<br> No. So what should we do?<br> You can keep him locked up or...<br> snip, snip. I can do it Tuesday.<br> No.<br> Or Wednesday.<br> Hoggett doesn't want the dog<br> operated on. He's a breeding dog.<br> I can sedate him, of course,<br> but he'll be useless as a working dog.<br> - I'll give you pills<br> to put in his food.<br> Good dog.<br> The Sheep Pig.<br> A pig doing the work of a sheepdog?<br> With Rex out of action and Fly injured from<br> the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice.<br> Maa! Maa! The boss has<br> to give you some medicine.<br> Oh, dear, I thought so!<br> It's horrible stuff, that.<br> - I know, but it's for the best.<br> - Young'un, if you say so.<br> Shoo! Shoo!<br> When the thought first came to him,<br> Farmer Hoggett dismissed<br> it as mere whimsy.<br> But, like most of his harebrained<br> ideas, it wouldn't go away.<br> - What are they doing?<br> - It's a sheepdog trial.<br> So it's like a<br> competition for sheepdogs?<br> And their bosses. It's<br> like an obstacle course.<br> How do they decide who wins?<br> It's time and mistakes. You get<br> points for how quick you are.<br> And they take points<br> off for every mistake.<br> Every time a sheep goes the wrong way,<br> that's a mistake and you lose points.<br> - Looks like fun!<br> - For a sheepdog, there's no prouder moment.<br> - Rex and I<br> used to- - Hmm?<br> Never mind.<br> Oh.<br> Was Rex a champion?<br> He had the makings of the greatest champion<br> there ever was, but it wasn't to be.<br> - What happened?<br> - A while back when Rex was in his prime,<br> the winter rains brought a<br> great flood to the valley.<br> Rex and the boss got most of<br> the flock onto the high ground.<br> Then Rex went back to<br> look for the strays.<br> He found them. They'd been<br> stranded by the rising water.<br> He tried to herd them across to<br> safety, but they wouldn't budge.<br> Too afraid and too stupid<br> to save their own skins.<br> It was freezing cold and<br> the water kept rising.<br> Rex stayed with them<br> right through the night.<br> By morning, the sheep were drowned.<br> - And when they found Rex, he was barely alive.<br> - Oh, Mom!<br> Two weeks rest in front of the<br> fire saw him back on his feet.<br> But his hearing was<br> never the same again.<br> He'd never want anyone to know,<br> but he's almost totally deaf.<br> - Is that why he's so, you know, angry?<br> - That's not the half of it.<br> All this was barely a month before<br> the Grand National Challenge.<br> He tried his best, but he couldn't hear<br> the boss's calls, and it slowed him up.<br> The cold truth is that, but<br> for the stupidity of sheep,<br> Rex would've been the<br> champion of champions.<br> Good dog.<br> That's it, all right. Good.<br> Here we go. All right.<br> Now, through here like this.<br> And then, big hook<br> to the left. Big hook.<br> Big hook. Through this gate here.<br> It was at that time that Mrs. Hoggett<br> began to worry about her husband.<br> But Farmer Hoggett knew<br> that little ideas...<br> that tickled and nagged<br> and refused to go away...<br> should never be ignored...<br> for in them lie the seeds of destiny.<br> Close the gate like<br> that, and you're done.<br> A Tragic Day.<br> Mom. Mom! Can we start work early today?<br> Oh, dear, it's not even dawn yet.<br> You can go to work when the<br> rooster crows. Oh, go back to sleep.<br> Ahem.<br> Um, excuse me.<br> Hello, sir. Excuse me,<br> but it's nearly dawn, and-<br> - What?<br> - Sorry to disturb you.<br> It's nearly dawn, and I wondered if you'd mind<br> crowing just a few minutes early this morning.<br> - Get out of here!<br> - But, well, see I-<br> - Get lost!<br> - Oh, okay.<br> Whoa!<br> Now the pig understood why the<br> sheep called all dogs wolves.<br> And he was filled with<br> a deep and terrible rage.<br> Maa! Maa!<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Hello, young'un.<br> Oh, Maa, can you get up?<br> I don't reckon.<br> It's over, Maa. The<br> wolves have gone far away.<br> I'll get the boss up<br> here to look after you.<br> - You'll be all right.<br> You'll be all right!<br> Oh, Maa! Maa!<br> Maa! Maa!<br> Maa!<br> Maa!<br> Home, Pig.<br> Fly knew that there was only<br> one fate for any creature...<br> that took the life of<br> a sheep on Hoggett Farm.<br> But Fly could never believe<br> that Babe was a sheep killer,<br> so she remained in the field to do<br> something she'd never talk to the sheep.<br> Tell me. Who killed the old one?<br> - Wolf! - Wolf. Is that the<br> only words you half-wits know?<br> - Wolf!<br> - Are you saying it was a dog?<br> - Where's Babe?<br> - Was it wolf or Babe?<br> Wolf! Babe!<br> Farmer Hoggett was carrying<br> something in the crook of one arm.<br> A kind of black, shiny tube.<br> Come, Pig.<br> The pig had a vague memory<br> that shiny tubes produced food,<br> and guessed that some<br> quite unexpected surprise...<br> would come out of two<br> small round mouths.<br> Babe! Wolf!<br> Babe! Wolf!<br> Quiet!<br> Fly decided to speak very slowly,<br> for it was a cold fact of<br> nature that sheep were stupid...<br> and no one would ever<br> persuade her otherwise.<br> Please, please would you be...<br> so kind as to tell me what happened?<br> Quiet!<br> Please, tell me what<br> happened this morning.<br> The sheep spoke very slowly...<br> for it was a cold fact of nature<br> that wolves were ignorant...<br> and nothing would<br> convince them otherwise.<br> Babe came! He saved us!<br> - The wolves killed Maa.<br> - But Babe drove the wolves away!<br> Thank you! Thank you!<br> Thank you all very much!<br> Pleasure talkin' to ya.<br> Hooey! Hoggett! Hooey! Arthur!<br> Oh, there you are!<br> Well, what do you think?<br> That was the police on the telephone.<br> Said there are wild dogs about.<br> Apparently the Mitchells<br> lost six lambs this morning.<br> What are you doing with that gun?<br> Oh, I<br> - Nothing.<br> Pig of Destiny!<br> It's all very simple. Half<br> an hour at 350 degrees.<br> I've given you rabbit<br> casserole for Friday.<br> Now, for Duchess, it's liver in<br> the morning, heart for the evening.<br> Except Fridays, when it's steak in<br> the morning, and cooked liver at night.<br> Warm it up a bit but test it, because she<br> bites into it before she knows what's what.<br> That'll be the bus.<br> - Oh, bye, bye.<br> - Have a good time. Bye.<br> Hello, everyone!<br> Oh, dearie me, Valda.<br> I know I have to be at<br> the National Conference.<br> I am the Assistant General Secretary<br> of the Northeast Region after all,<br> but I do worry about<br> leaving that man alone.<br> - Still acting a bit strange?<br> - Just silly things.<br> Odd little things only<br> a wife would notice.<br> - Still, he can't get up to too much mischief in three days.<br> - Of course not.<br> Go on.<br> Go on!<br> - Oh! Good evening.<br> Shame about the weather.<br> Nasty cough!<br> It had been a long time<br> since Arthur Hoggett...<br> had had an animal in whose<br> abilities he had so much faith.<br> And with the National Grand Challenge<br> Sheepdog Trials only two days away,<br> he wasn't going to let the fact<br> that his animal was a pig deter him.<br> He had been worried, for<br> he was a truthful man,<br> that the heading might<br> say "Name of dog. "<br> And then whatever he put would be a lie.<br> But as it happened, luck, for<br> the moment, was running with him.<br> It's all right, really!<br> I'm just, well<br> - Bless you.<br> Whoa, whoa! Uh, easy, whoa! Ah.<br> Oh, no.<br> - So, ah... what's happening?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Shh. Easy, easy.<br> - Good pig. Good pig.<br> - Huh? Huh?<br> Hold still. Hold still.<br> Huh?<br> There are many perfectly<br> nice cats in the world.<br> But every barrel has its bad apples.<br> And it is well to heed the old adage,<br> "Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge. "<br> - How are you feeling?<br> - A bit tired.<br> You'll need a good sleep to put<br> you in top condition tomorrow.<br> Don't stay up too late. Good night.<br> Good night, Mom.<br> Oh, do forgive me for<br> scratching you, dear.<br> I got a bit carried<br> away. It's a cat thing.<br> Oh. Well-<br> But oh-<br> Feeling good about tomorrow, are you?<br> Mm-hmm. It should be<br> all right, I think.<br> I probably shouldn't say this,<br> but I'm not sure if you realize...<br> how much the other animals are laughing<br> at you for this sheepdog business.<br> Why would they do that?<br> Well, they say that you've forgotten<br> that you're a pig. Isn't that silly?<br> They even say that you<br> don't know what pigs are for.<br> What do you mean?<br> - You know... why pigs are here.<br> - Why are any of us here?<br> Well, the cow's here to be milked.<br> The dogs are here to help the<br> boss's husband with the sheep.<br> And I'm here to be beautiful<br> and affectionate to the boss.<br> Yes?<br> The fact is that pigs<br> don't have a purpose.<br> Just like ducks don't have a purpose.<br> - I don't- - All right, for<br> you own sake, I'll be blunt.<br> Why do the bosses keep<br> ducks? To eat them.<br> So why do the bosses keep a pig?<br> The fact is that animals that don't seem<br> to have a purpose really do have a purpose.<br> The bosses have to eat. It's probably<br> the most noble purpose of all...<br> when you come to think about it.<br> They eat pigs?<br> Pork, they call it. Or bacon.<br> They only call them<br> pigs when they're alive.<br> But, uh, I'm a sheep pig!<br> The boss's husband's just<br> playing a little game with you.<br> Believe me, sooner or<br> later, every pig gets eaten.<br> That's the way the world works.<br> Oh! I haven't upset you, have I?<br> - Mom?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Mom!<br> - Good heavens!<br> What on earth are you<br> doing out in the rain?<br> You should be looking after yourself<br> with such a big day ahead of you.<br> - Are pigs for eatin'?<br> - Who told you that?<br> The cat told me. Pigs don't have<br> a purpose except to be eaten.<br> Is it true?<br> It's true. For many pigs, it's true.<br> So my mother, my father,<br> my brothers and my sisters,<br> - all- -<br> Probably, dear.<br> - Do you want to talk about it?<br> - No, it's all right.<br> I understand. I'll be all right.<br> Even... the boss?<br> Yes, dear.<br> Ooh! Ooo!<br> Babe?<br> Babe!<br> Babe!<br> Babe!<br> Babe!<br> Babe's run away.<br> Rex?<br> Please?<br> Call the boss.<br> He's over here.<br> Hold on, Pig. You'll be home soon.<br> He's got a cold, but that<br> doesn't explain a pig not eating.<br> He's got me stonkered, Arthur.<br> But I can tell you this.<br> If you don't get fluids into<br> him soon, you're gonna lose him.<br> C'mon, son. Pull yourself together.<br> The boss needs you.<br> Here we go.<br> Come on, Pig. Ah, come on.<br> There's my boy.<br> Come on, then. Come on.<br> Listen, Arthur, I'll<br> tell you what we can do.<br> You're listed third, but we<br> can put you last in the program.<br> However, you must be here by 3:30;<br> otherwise you'll be disqualified.<br> All right.<br> And welcome back to the National<br> Grand Challenge Sheepdog Trials...<br> coming today from the Kingsmith Show<br> Ground in the heart of sheep country.<br> The weather's been patchy,<br> but we've already seen some<br> wonderful work by these talented dogs.<br> Stay there.<br> Excuse me, sheep.<br> Hello! Hello! Good morning to you all!<br> I've never met a sheep with<br> such a strong, dark face.<br> Are they feeding you well?<br> Babe, I'll try.<br> All right, blockheads!<br> Pay attention over here!<br> Now, you pay attention to<br> what this pig has to say...<br> or I'll come in there<br> and rip you to shreds!<br> Hadn't thought of this. Keep talking<br> to them. I'll see what I can do.<br> - Doesn't it look a picture? Our show ground on the telly!<br> - Apart from the weather.<br> - Look! There's your Bert!<br> - Bert Ford and Sweep doing very well.<br> - Sweep's having a little trouble with this gate, Clive.<br> - A lot of trouble actually.<br> - That's going to set Bert back.<br> - Don't worry, Valda. Just a little slipup.<br> Look, he's doing much better now.<br> Too many loose sheep. And Sweep's<br> usually such a reliable dog.<br> Hey, whoa. Stop!<br> If those sheep won't talk to Babe, the<br> boss is going to look like an idiot.<br> - I don't know what to do.<br> - There is one thing.<br> I gotta go! I'll try to be back in time.<br> Ahem. It must've been<br> terrible weather for you,<br> - out in the field with all<br> this rain we've been having.<br> Hey, that dog's in a hurry.<br> Come on, Nick, I got a<br> beer and a TV waiting.<br> The last entry is<br> Pig. Owner, A. Hoggett.<br> - Was that "Hoggett"?<br> - I think it was!<br> - Huh?<br> - He said Hoggett. It was clear as a bell.<br> Must be another Hoggett. We only have<br> the two dogs, and they certainly...<br> aren't-<br> Wolf! Wolf!<br> Wolf! Wolf!<br> Shut up, you morons!<br> The little pig's in trouble.<br> What trouble has come to our Babe, wolf?<br> The sheep at the trials won't<br> talk to the little fellow.<br> They won't listen. He<br> doesn't know what to do.<br> Don't know what we could do to help.<br> - It's not right to give help to a wolf.<br> - You wait here, wolf.<br> You'll have to speak up. I'm<br> a... little hard of hearing.<br> I asked you to wait here, wolf.<br> Do what you're told by<br> an old sheep for a change.<br> We'll see what we can do for you.<br> Work completed. Restore power.<br> Very frustrating to<br> be sitting up here...<br> wondering what's causing the delay.<br> We have someone on their<br> way to the judges' rooms now.<br> We'll tell you what's causing the<br> problem as soon as we find out.<br> - Perhaps it's a drug test?<br> - Yeah, it could be.<br> - I've never heard of a drug<br> test at a sheepdog contest before.<br> We've got somethin' here that<br> might be of use to our pig.<br> Password! Password!<br> Before we gives you anythin',<br> - you'll be makin' us a solemn promise.<br> - Yes?<br> - Treat us civil! - Yes!<br> You gotta treat us nice-like.<br> I'll try.<br> - No bitin'!<br> - That's right. Wolf must avoid bitin' us sheep...<br> - at all costs!<br> - All right! I'll try that too.<br> It's preposterous! We'd be the laughingstock<br> of every sheepdog organization...<br> - in every civilized country<br> in the world! - There's no rule-<br> We'll see about that when the adjudication<br> committee have finished their meeting.<br> What will we have next year, a<br> laughing hyena doing show jumping?<br> But the most important of<br> all, you must promise...<br> never ever to let this<br> password we be about to give...<br> to be used against any sheep anywhere.<br> I promise you that. I'll make<br> sure the pig knows it too.<br> - We have the promise!<br> - 'Tis for Babe.<br> Maa would have wanted it.<br> Baa, ram, ewe.<br> Baa, ram, ewe.<br> To your breed, your<br> fleece, your clan be true.<br> Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.<br> Is that it? Is that the password?<br> Mr. Hoggett, the judges would<br> like me to convey to you...<br> their disappointment that<br> a man such as yourself,<br> with a long and honorable association with<br> the work of National Sheepdog Association,<br> should see fit to flout...<br> the historic conventions which<br> have long ruled our sport.<br> However we find there<br> is no rule, as such,<br> which would prevent your...<br> animal... being entered.<br> The committee has ruled<br> that if you wish to proceed,<br> there is nothing we can do to stop you.<br> What do you wish to do?<br> There appears to be some<br> movement down there now.<br> I expect if there are<br> no further problems,<br> we shall see Hoggett and his dog Pig.<br> - Unusual name. Strange name, isn't it?<br> - Pig.<br> Anyone for a game of cards?<br> Oh, good grief! Look!<br> He's a fool!<br> Entry number 23, Mr.<br> A. Hoggett with Pig.<br> This is just too crazy to believe.<br> And if that isn't enough. We<br> have a stray dog on the field.<br> They trying to round him up?<br> The dog's gonna give a few<br> tips on how to be a sheep pig.<br> Well, it's up to him now.<br> Away to me, Pig.<br> Get off!<br> Baa, ram, ewe. Baa, ram, ewe!<br> To your breed, your<br> fleece, your clan be true.<br> Sheep be true. Baa, ram, ewe.<br> What... what did you say?<br> Get yourself a dog, Hoggett.<br> There, there, Esme. It's<br> not the end of the world.<br> Is he just going to stand<br> there until his time runs out?<br> Or could this be some sort of protest?<br> Maybe we should line up an<br> interview with the sheep pig?<br> Or the sheep pig's trainer.<br> He's a lively sort of fellow<br> by the looks of things.<br> Good heavens!<br> - Hey!<br> - Shh.<br> It's Babe!<br> I-<br> I-<br> - It,<br> uh- - Hmm.<br> Oh, beautifully done! I can't tell<br> you how grateful I am to y'all.<br> Now, for one last favor.<br> If the three ladies with collars<br> would kindly walk out of the ring,<br> I'd be very much obliged.<br> And so it was that in<br> all the celebration,<br> in all the hubbub of<br> noise and excitement,<br> there were two figures who<br> stood silent and still...<br> side by side.<br> The pig did it! The perfect score!<br> Yippee! Yippee!<br> And though every single human in the<br> stands or in the commentary boxes...<br> was at a complete loss for words,<br> the man, who in his life had uttered<br> fewer words than any of them...<br> knew exactly what to say.<br> That'll do, Pig.<br> That'll do.<br> And a-one and a-two<br> and a-three. Hit it.<br>
