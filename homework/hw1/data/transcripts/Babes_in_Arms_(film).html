My first 100 bucks.<br> - And it's only the beginning too.<br> - Is it really the beginning?<br> Does it mean<br> that I'm really on my way in the theater?<br> - I want success so.<br> - And you'll have it.<br> I know you will, Mickey.<br> Just think when our names<br> are up in electric lights.<br> You, the big composer and producer,<br> and me, the singing star.<br> Oh, and I'll work hard for you, Mickey,<br> honest I will.<br> Yeah, then when we go<br> on our vacations to Europe...<br> ...you know, like you read in the paper.<br> - Our folks won't have to worry.<br> - No.<br> We can pay the bills then.<br> Pat, sometimes<br> do you ever feel older than your folks?<br> Lots. Especially when they talk about<br> Yeah, and making a comeback.<br> Gee, it must be terrible to be a has-been.<br> Don't talk like that. It scares me.<br> We gotta work hard<br> and make a lot of dough for our folks.<br> That will be fun.<br> Oh, won't it be fun, Mickey?<br> Oh, with both of us in there pitching,<br> it certainly will be.<br> It's got to be.<br> Pat, I'd like to buy you a little something<br> out of this 100 bucks, but l...<br> oh, we gotta pay our grocery bill too.<br> Well, l... Just the same<br> I'd like to show my appreciation some way.<br> Would you like my pin?<br> It's your music class pin.<br> Well, what do you want me to say?<br> You know what I want you to say.<br> Well, I won't.<br> All right then, don't.<br> Oh, Pat, I do.<br> You do what?<br> I do,<br> what you want me to say and I won't.<br> Very much.<br> - Well, that settles that.<br> - Yeah.<br> Gee, you know, it's good for a man<br> to have responsibilities.<br> Your act is just as sure fire as it was<br> when you were knocking them in the aisle.<br> Say, Dad. Dad, what's going on here?<br> Mickey, we're going on the road,<br> all of us.<br> - Oh, gee, that's swell, Dad. When do leave?<br> - Mickey, none of us kids can go.<br> None of the kids can...<br> What do you mean, Dad?<br> Well, you see, son, it's only the acts<br> that go, no excess baggage.<br> You call talent excess baggage?<br> Dad, there's a lot of entertainment<br> on this side of the room.<br> You folks are responsible for it.<br> We're your kids, chips off the old block.<br> Most of us were born in theaters,<br> greasepaint in our veins.<br> You say you don't want us<br> to go on a stage. No.<br> You want us to be lawyers and brokers<br> and your girls to marry rich guys.<br> - I suppose that's bad being a broker.<br> - Clark Gable ain't on relief.<br> - You're too young, all of you.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> I suppose I'm too young<br> to sell a song I wrote.<br> Look, 100 bucks in advance.<br> - What?<br> - Mickey, you sold your song.<br> - Yeah, Mom, and it's all yours too.<br> - Oh, Mickey, I'm so proud of you.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Of course, I always knew you had talent.<br> Well, so do the other kids.<br> I've seen them do their stuff.<br> Take our sister for instance.<br> What a voice, a natural.<br> Two more years and she'll be in the Met.<br> Patsy and Don Jr. And Dody<br> are swell dancers.<br> - But our acts are routine, they're standard.<br> - I'll say they're standard.<br> So standard that when you miss a line<br> the audience can prompt you.<br> All right, I'm sorry.<br> I don't mean to be fresh,<br> but I've got a new slant on things.<br> Got my finger on the pulse of the public.<br> You wanna hear something?<br> Molly and Patsy come on over here.<br> Look out. Spread out kids,<br> give us room to work here, will you?<br> Get set. We'll show them<br> whether we got talent or not.<br> Wait, until you hear,<br> this will send you solid.<br> Now, come on, kids, give your all.<br> To look at us you'd never dream<br> The two of us were twins<br> In fact it's quite ridiculously odd<br> But speaking pedagogically<br> And not too biologically<br> We're really just like two peas in a pod<br> We both like to swim<br> And we both like to dance<br> We both could fall in love with Gable<br> If we had the chance<br> Our tastes are just the same<br> Except for just one thing<br> I like opera<br> I like swing<br> We both like to eat<br> But it pains us to discuss<br> The fact we like potatoes<br> But potatoes don't like us<br> But when we want to sing a song<br> We're really on a spot<br> For I sing sweet<br> And I sing hot<br> You are my lucky star<br> My darling, you're my lucky star<br> I saw you from afar<br> Rudolpho<br> Robert Taylor<br> Minneapolis and St. Paul<br> You are<br> My lucky star<br> Once there was a barber<br> A barber who lived in Spain<br> He was a barbering fool,<br> A shaving fool, shaving fool from Spain<br> He was kind of crazy,<br> He was always singing in the rain<br> His name was Figaro<br> The barber of Seville<br> Figaro<br> Figaro<br> Figaro was Spanish<br> Every time there's a bullfight<br> He quits<br> Shave and a hair cut, six bits<br> Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro<br> Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro<br> Hi de ho Figaro, Hi de ho Figaro<br> Hi de ho ho de ho fig fig Figaro<br> Figaro<br> Figaro<br> Figaro<br> We're gonna break it up tonight<br> Stand back<br> Give them room<br> - You've gotta clown<br> - Yeah, you gotta clown on old Broadway<br> Broadway rhythm, it's got me<br> Everybody dance<br> Broadway rhythm, it's got me<br> Everybody dance<br> Out on the gay white way<br> And each merry cafe<br> Orchestras play<br> Taking your breath away with that<br> Broadway rhythm, it's got me<br> Everybody sing<br> Everybody stand right up and dance<br> - Hey, Pop, how did you like that?<br> - Oh, it was fine. Grand, son.<br> Great, but you see, for instance,<br> that number, it just wouldn't fit in.<br> - Well, for Pete's sake, why?<br> - Because we're doing a comeback show.<br> The kind of acts we did on the big time.<br> They've got value, a selling point.<br> Oh, I get you, Pop.<br> I've gotta show you,<br> just like the rest of the world.<br> I thought we could help you, but<br> you don't want us on the stage, do you?<br> - Just because you're all...

In...<br> Why, I think that would be swell.<br> And with your name and all...<br> You don't wanna fool around<br> with a punk like this.<br> You be quiet. You wanna come over<br> to my place for dinner and talk it over?<br> - Tomorrow night? Oh, l...<br> - Say, listen.<br> My aunt's gonna put you in<br> the state work school where you belong.<br> Why, you...!<br> - Please, don't fight over me.<br> - Stop it. Mickey!<br> - Don't worry, it's a pleasure.<br> - Stop it! Stop it!<br> Oh, my perfumes.<br> Hey, get out of here.<br> Get out of here.<br> Get out of here, all of you. Get out.<br> Come now, come now, quiet, please.<br> This is not a picnic.<br> This is a very serious matter.<br> Proceed, Mr. Marks.<br> And when these young roughnecks<br> finished up...<br> ...my drugstore looked as though<br> they'd taken an ax to it.<br> I want you to know that seven bottles...<br> ...of my most expensive perfumes<br> were busted.<br> Forgive me if I say I told you so.<br> Martha, my faith in human nature<br> would be shattered if you didn't.<br> Why doesn't somebody tell<br> what he said to my brother?<br> I'll tell. I was there.<br> He told Mickey his aunt was<br> gonna put him in the state work school.<br> I hope you see<br> how this proves every point I made.<br> Even with provocation,<br> wrecking this man's shop...<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> Young man, I'll trouble you<br> to step into my private office.<br> There are things I'd like to clear up.<br> The rest of you will kindly wait here.<br> - Mickey.<br> - Well?<br> Let you in on a little secret.<br> I don't need those glasses<br> any more than a rabbit.<br> But in times of stress,<br> they're the best safety valve I ever had.<br> Gives me time to think too before acting.<br> - You ought to find something like that.<br> - Oh, I got it.<br> You mean I ought to think first<br> and then bust-up drugstores afterwards.<br> Come over here and sit down.<br> - Quit school, huh?<br> - Yeah, last fall.<br> Tried to get a job. Started writing songs,<br> you know, show numbers.<br> Where's your father playing now?<br> Schenectady.<br> Good booking?<br> I'm so worried about my family, judge,<br> I'm sick inside me.<br> Miss Steele might be right, Mickey.<br> It's not fair for you youngsters<br> to be carrying grownup burdens.<br> I'm wondering if you were my son, if<br> I wouldn't rather see you in some school...<br> ...getting an education.<br> Yes, I think if I were your parents,<br> I might sign Miss Steele's petition.<br> No, no, no, judge, you don't understand.<br> She don't understand either.<br> Why, she don't mean no harm to us...<br> ...but we're not her kind of people<br> or yours either.<br> We belong in show business.<br> We gotta start young so we can get<br> some steel in our backbone.<br> Well, gee, we're developing it.<br> You couldn't teach us a trade.<br> We got one.<br> And you couldn't do without it.<br> We're only kids now...<br> ...but someday we're gonna be<br> the guys that make you laugh and cry.<br> Think that there's a little stardust left<br> on life's dirty old pan.<br> She don't understand.<br> Why, she'd put butterflies to work<br> making rubber tires.<br> I'm not saying I hate her, but why can't<br> people leave other people alone?<br> Defense sustained. Case dismissed.<br> I'll give you 30 days probation<br> to square yourself with Mr. Marks.<br> Here he is now.<br> - What happened, Mickey?<br> - Was it all right?<br> Oh, everything's swell.<br> I guess I showed you, twerp.<br> The judge bought out the whole front row.<br> Look at that.<br> Come on, kids,<br> we got some rehearsing to do.<br> Isn't that marvelous?<br> It seems we stood<br> And talked like this before<br> We looked at each other<br> In the same way then<br> But I can't remember where or when<br> The clothes you're wearing<br> Are the clothes you wore<br> The smile you are smiling<br> You were smiling then<br> But I can't remember where or when<br> Some things that happen<br> For the first time<br> Seem to be happening again<br> And so it seems that we have met before<br> And laughed before<br> And loved before<br> But who knows where or when<br> Come on, put some life in that song,<br> will you?<br> Patsy, will you hook my collar<br> in the back for me, please?<br> So you're going to dinner<br> with Rosalie tonight?<br> Don't go getting jealous.<br> We haven't got time for that.<br> - She made eyes at you.<br> - Oh, you're crazy.<br> I'm not. She's practicing to be a glamour<br> girl, so she can get back into pictures.<br> If those two sing that song like that,<br> the audience will think it's a lullaby.<br> It seems we've stood<br> And talked like this before<br> We looked at each other<br> In the same way then<br> But I can't remember where or when<br> That's right. With feeling like that.<br> I figure you have to know<br> what you're singing about...<br> ...before you can give<br> the idea to others.<br> Don and Molly don't know<br> what they're singing about?<br> They're just bashful in front of people,<br> that's all.<br> Come on, let's go out<br> and see if we can't needle them up a bit.<br> And so it seems that we have met before<br> And laughed before<br> And loved before<br> - But who knows where<br> - But who knows where<br> - Or when<br> - Or when<br> That's what the audience will be doing<br> if you sing the song like that.<br> - We were just rehearsing.<br> - Yeah. Well, that's no excuse.<br> Molly's heard pop say a million times,<br> do your best always if you wanna improve.<br> Wait until Dad's suit fits you<br> before you try to talk like him.<br> The coat fits all right. I can button it up so<br> nobody can see how loose the pants are.<br> I wanted my white pants,<br> but wouldn't they be at the cleaners?<br> She'll be so busy talking about herself<br> that she won't notice.<br> Maybe not, but lay off me.<br> You gotta get some feeling into this.<br> This show is all business.<br> - Get in there and try the number again.<br> - Do we have to do it in the canoe?<br> It's cramped in there, you can't move.<br> All right.<br> Then come on, do it over here...<br> ...so long as you get some feeling into it.<br> Spread out.<br> Kids, get back to your places.<br> We're gonna try the number again.<br> - Bring that settee down here, please.<br> - I wish they would make up their minds.<br> Spread out.<br> Give them plenty of room to work.<br> Start the number back of the settee here<br> and later on you can come around in front.<br> For goodness' sake,<br> put some real feeling into it.<br> All right, Antonio.<br> Give them the introduction.<br> It seems we stood<br> And talked like this before<br> We looked at each other<br> In the same way then<br> But I can't remember where or when<br> The clothes you're wearing<br> Are the clothes you wore<br> The smile you are smiling<br> You were smiling then<br> But I can't remember where or when<br> Some things that happened<br> For the first time<br> Seem to be happening again<br> And so it seems that we have met before<br> And laughed before<br> And loved before<br> But who knows where<br> Or when<br> And so it seems that we have met before<br> And laughed before<br> And loved before<br> - But who knows where<br> - But who knows where<br> - Or when<br> - Or when<br> Swell.

That's why I think my production<br> would be perfect for you.<br> Do you think so?<br> Oh, I was praying you'd say that.<br> Oh, Michael, don't tell me you're going<br> to give me my chance.<br> Well, if I had the dough, I would.<br> How much do you need?<br> Well, let me...<br> Let me see.<br> We're gonna use a barn some actors used<br> last summer, turn it into an outdoor theater.<br> I figured if we all pitched in together...<br> That is, for the scenery and the costumes<br> and everything, it would run us about $287.<br> Have you got it yet?<br> No.<br> Well, you have now.<br> Move over here where we can talk.<br> - Oh, it will be exciting.<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> I can hardly wait.<br> We'll work together wonderfully,<br> you and I.

They're daddy's best.<br> Well, I can't pass up anything like this.<br> I suggest, sir, it would draw better<br> if one bites the end off.<br> How could I make a mistake like that?<br> Don't draw the cigar smoke in,<br> Mr. Moran.<br> Blow it out for your own sake.<br> This is... This is delightful.<br> When does the show start rehearsing?<br> Well, as soon as I can get it...<br> When?<br> Well, I'll phone you.<br> I'll phone you tomorrow<br> and let you know.<br> You'll have to excuse me, please.<br> I've got another appointment.<br> Thanks for the dinner.<br> It was swell while it lasted.<br> - Hey, Mickey, here's your pants.<br> - Where have you been?<br> Go on, get up there in your place,<br> would you?<br> All right, kids, that's enough.<br> Take a rest.

More... More...<br> - Suave?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, go on. Now, let's try it again.<br> Come on, right from where we left off.<br> Here we go.<br> You're up there, Baby. That's it, fine.<br> Your Majesty.<br> I have a feeling<br> I'm going to find Egypt fascinating.<br> Terrible. Terrible. Don, terrible.<br> - I didn't think so.<br> - It's the way you read the lines.<br> There's no feeling to it or anything.<br> Maybe we'd better try it here on the couch.<br> Don, come and sit beside her.<br> I want a more virile approach,<br> like Clark Gable would do it.<br> Come on, do it once for me, will you?<br> Your Majesty, I have a feeling<br> I'm going to find Egypt fascinating.<br> No, no, that's still not it, Don.<br> Let me show you, will you?<br> Just stand up there for a minute. Look.<br> Now, see here, Cleo.<br> You've stalled me for the last time.<br> You can't push Mark Antony around<br> like that and get away with it.<br> Last month, I took over the south side.<br> Now, I'm taking over the palace.<br> And what's more,<br> I'm taking over you, see?<br> Get your things packed.<br> We're taking a honeymoon on the Nile.<br> I've got a barge waiting<br> with the motor running.<br> Now, you see?<br> That's more the way Gable would do it.<br> - Well, Gable and I work differently.<br> - Yeah, that's why he works more often.<br> Okay, Sid, it's your cue.<br> Don, you're over here now.<br> Cleopatra, who is this man?<br> - Who's this?<br> - Well, that's your uncle, Croesus.<br> But Cleopatra didn't have an uncle.<br> Well, she has now.<br> - Shall I keep going while I'm hot?<br> - You're as cold as an ice cube.<br> Look, I want this uncle<br> to be a violent character.<br> Like Lionel Barrymore would play it.<br> I mean, when he comes into this room...<br> ...and finds his niece here<br> with a strange man, he's...<br> He's gotta be...<br> - Suave?<br> - No, furious.<br> Look, Sid,<br> let me show you what I mean, huh?<br> Now, this is the way Barrymore would do it.<br> Now, watch, Sid.<br> Now, see here, Cleo.<br> This isn't by chance<br> one of your latest admirers, is it?<br> Why, uncle,<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> Don't try to act innocent, my child.<br> The whole town's talking.<br> Now, see here, sonny, we don't like<br> strangers hanging around this place.<br> I'll give you just 48 hours to get out.<br> Pardon me, Don.<br> When I go, Cleo goes with me.<br> I love her, you see?<br> Out of the way, uncle. We're leaving.<br> Now, look here, Cleo. I'm your uncle.<br> I love you as if you were my own niece.<br> But this man is marrying you<br> just for your money.<br> She's going with me, understand?<br> Do you love me<br> because I'm worth $50 million?<br> Nonsense. I'd love you<br> if you only had $40 million.<br> Money isn't everything.<br> And I love you.<br> Yes, that's fine, Miss Essex.<br> That's just right.<br> Here, Don, you take over from there.<br> Come on, Clark Antony,<br> finish the scene.<br> Well, if you insist.<br> - Is this the sleeper bus for Schenectady?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Have you seen a little girl about?<br> Oh, never mind.<br> Oh, Pat. Patty.<br> Look, let me talk to you.<br> - Will you listen to me, please?<br> - No, I won' t.<br> - Wait a minute, that's acting like a big baby.<br> - I'm not a baby, Mr. Moran.<br> - Then why are you going to Schenectady?<br> - I wanna see my mother.<br> - Why?<br> - None of your business.<br> Wait a minute, Pat.<br> Listen, I'm doing the best I can.<br> Oh, you're doing grand for Baby Rosalie.<br> - Whatever I've done, I've had to do.<br> - Did you have to kiss Baby Rosalie today?<br> Well, that's my business, honey.<br> I'm a director.<br> Then you'd better get to work,<br> Mr. Ziegfeld.<br> The Girl Scouts<br> are just clamoring for you.<br> - Oh, you don't have to talk...<br> - Here. I suppose you want this too.<br> Indian giver.<br> Listen, how can I be an Indian giver...?<br> Oh, Pat, listen.<br> Won't you let me explain?<br> Hey! Hey, Patsy!<br> Give me a chance to explain, will you?<br> Will you let me...?<br> I cried for you<br> Now, it's your turn to cry over me<br> Every road has a turning<br> That's one thing you're learning<br> I cried for you<br> What a fool I used to be<br> But I'll find two eyes<br> Just a little bit bluer<br> I'll find a heart<br> Just a little bit truer<br> I cried for you<br> Now, it's your turn to cry<br> Over me<br> I know I'm no glamour girl like Baby...<br> Like her.<br> But maybe someday, you'll realize that<br> glamour isn't the only thing in this world.<br> If your show's a flop, you'll find<br> you can't eat glamour for breakfast.<br> Anyway,<br> I might be pretty good-looking myself...<br> ...when I grow out<br> of this ugly duckling stage.<br> And you're no Clark Gable yourself.<br> But that's all right.<br> You go your way and I'll go mine.<br> Don't worry about me. I'll recover.<br> Time is a great healer.<br> But in the future, if we should meet again<br> at the opera or at a ball...<br> ...and I'm dazzling in my diamonds<br> and pearls and ermine wraps...<br> ...and surrounded by lords<br> and dukes and princes...<br> ...you'll probably be sorry.<br> And you'll probably realize that life is...<br> ...just an idiot's delight.<br> And as I speed through the dark night<br> into the abyss of oblivion...<br> ...I can only say thanks.<br> Thanks for the memory.<br> I'll find two eyes<br> Just a little bit bluer<br> I'll find a heart<br> Just a little bit truer<br> I cried for you<br> Now, it's your turn to cry<br> Over me<br> - George, everybody in?<br> - All but Eddie.<br> - He'll be here shortly.<br> - Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes.<br> - You're on seconds, folks.<br> - Okay.<br> - Who opens the show tonight?<br> - You fellows do.<br> We do? What's the idea...?<br> Hey, Joe, why do we open the bill?<br> Listen, we've gotta take turns<br> in opening the show.<br> - We're all headliners.<br> - But we got a terrific finish.<br> - You want to see anyone?<br> - Yes, I wanna see my mother, Mrs. Barton.<br> - Okay. Dressing Room Number 4.<br> - Thank you.<br> We'll try it that way tonight<br> and we'll see how it works.<br> - For the love of Mike, Patsy.<br> - Hello, Mr. Moran.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I got kind of lonesome for my mother.<br> Things got so tough<br> you had to come up here, huh?<br> - Oh, no. Everything's just fine.<br> - Lillian, Lillian, I got a surprise for you.<br> - Look what I found in the hall.<br> - Why, Patsy.<br> Why, did the house<br> burn down or something?<br> Can't a girl come to see her mother<br> without everybody thinking she's crazy?<br> Hello, Mrs. Moran.<br> - Hi, Patsy.<br> - When did you get in here?<br> Patsy, tell me, what's Mickey doing?<br> What's Mickey doing?<br> He's got a lot of kids together and he's<br> gonna put on a show, a wonderful show.<br> - He's doing what?<br> - Dear, don't get excited.<br> - He didn't say anything in his postcard.<br> - Is Junior in it?<br> - How's Dody?<br> - How Frankie's dance?<br> - It's grand.<br> - What's this baloney about a show?<br> It's the truth.<br> He wrote it, and now he's gonna produce it.<br> And he's got the Rangerettes<br> and Baby Rosalie and...<br> oh, he's got a lot of kids.<br> No kidding. It's gonna be swell.<br> Why did Mickey do this?<br> Miss Steele said that<br> we weren't having the proper care...<br> ...and she threatened to send us<br> to the state work school.<br> - What state work school?<br> - An institution?<br> How do you like that?<br> Our kids in a work school.<br> Listen, folks, let's give up<br> this silly tour and go home.<br> - I'm going home.<br> - Right.<br> George, we can't do that<br> just because the going is tough.<br> - I know business will pick up next week.<br> - You told us that last week...<br> I'm gonna put you all out of here...<br> ...because I wanna talk to Patsy.<br> - Right you are. Everybody get out of here.<br> Mickey's show sounds elegant.<br> Where did he get the money?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Isn't Baby Rosalie the movie baby?<br> - She's the star of the show.<br> - Wonderful.<br> Now, dear, tell me, why aren't you in it?<br> Oh, I thought I wanted a theatrical career,<br> but I changed my mind.<br> Why?<br> Too many heartaches.<br> - Now, what do you know about heartaches?<br> - Well...<br> You and Mickey quarrel?<br> You did, didn't you?<br> And you quit the show<br> and came up here to see me?<br> You shouldn't have done that, Patsy.<br> Well, he took all my songs<br> and gave them to her.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> - Why not?<br> - Mickey was doing it for everybody.<br> Patsy, your daddy was a minstrel man.<br> So was his daddy.<br> They did plenty of crazy things,<br> but they never walked out on a show.<br> But, Mother, Mickey and I were...<br> And she kept putting her arms<br> around him and I just couldn't...<br> Sid, girls, what are you standing<br> around for? Hurry up, get ready.<br> Aren't you finished with that?<br> I may be a sap about the men I pick,<br> but I'm no quitter.<br> So there. My family are all troupers<br> and we don't walk out on any show.<br> Who said anything about<br> walking out on any...?<br> Oh, women.<br> See who it is, Millicent.<br> - Is Miss Essex dressed?<br> - Come in, Michael.<br> Oh, how's our little star? Fine, I hope.<br> - A little nervous. Sit down.<br> - Thanks.<br> - How's our director?<br> - I'm a little nervous too, and then some.<br> That's a sign of a good trouper.<br> Then I must be great. Gee, I wished I hadn't<br> plastered my name all over everything.<br> - You'll get used to it. Look at me.<br> - Well, maybe.<br> Get out of my way or I'll put you<br> in jail where you belong, the lot of you.<br> My father!<br> Well, there you are, young lady.<br> - Where's this Michael Z. Moran?<br> - I'm him.<br> So you're the smart twerp that was going to<br> exploit the prestige of an important name.<br> - Why, for a nickel...<br> - Wait a minute...<br> Wait nothing. Here, young lady,<br> get into this coat. We're getting out of here.<br> - But she's the star of the show.<br> - Don't make me laugh.<br> I'm grooming her for a comeback.<br> Millicent, you pack up. Come on.<br> - But, father, I've got a great part.<br> - Listen, you can't take her away.<br> - Take her. She's a pain in the neck.<br> - Come on.<br> - Listen. Will you listen?<br> - Father, dear...<br> - She's got money in the show.<br> - Kiss that goodbye.<br> I'll tell you when you have<br> a great part just as I always did.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - What about the audience?<br> - Are we gonna give a show?<br> - What's gonna happen?<br> Quiet, will you?<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do?<br> Give me a chance to think.<br> Come on with me, Patsy.<br> Everybody out but Patsy.<br> The show is going on.<br> The curtain goes up in seven minutes.<br> Now, snap into it, will you, kids?<br> Get your makeup on.<br> I wrote this show for you, see?<br> Get out there and show them<br> I wasn't crazy when I did it.<br> Don't think things have changed<br> between you and me. Go out and sell it.<br> - Oh, Mickey, you're...<br> - Never mind.<br> I know what I am, an Indian giver.<br> What's the delay, Mickey?<br> I didn't know<br> you could have so much trouble.<br> Would you do me a favor?<br> Would you make a speech...?<br> Mickey, here's your makeup.<br> You'd better hurry.<br> Tell them that Patsy's going on instead.<br> - What's happened?<br> - Tell you later.<br> Would you do that for me, please?<br> - All right, Mickey.<br> - Thanks.<br> My daddy was a minstrel man<br> When minstrels were the thing<br> When Mr. Bones and Mr. Jones<br> Danced the buck and wing<br> When Eddie Leonard was so great<br> And Primrose was the king<br> Gee, I'd like to be a minstrel man<br> I'd like to black my face<br> Put on a stovepipe hat<br> Get out an old banjo<br> And go once again down memory lane<br> With an old-fashioned minstrel show<br> Going to run all night<br> Going to run all day<br> I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag<br> Somebody bet on the bay<br> Here they come.<br> Hurry, we go on in a minute.<br> I'm hurrying.<br> Come from Alabammy<br> Come from Alabammy<br> Come from Alabammy<br> Come from Alabammy<br> Come from Alabammy<br> With my banjo on my knee<br> I come from Alabammy<br> With my banjo on my knee<br> I'm going to Louisiana<br> For my true love to see<br> Now, it rained all night the day I left<br> The weather, it was so dry<br> The sun so hot I froze to death<br> Susanna, don't you cry<br> Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me<br> I've come from Alabama<br> With a banjo on my knee<br> Oh, Susanna, oh, don't you cry for me<br> I come from Alabammy<br> With my banjo on my knee<br> Gentlemen, be seated<br> Mr. Bones, Mr. Bones<br> I've a question to ask<br> - There is something that I want to know<br> - Well, tell me, sonny<br> Mr. Bones, will you tell me<br> And answer me right<br> Who's that lady<br> You were with last night?<br> Now, Mr. Interlocutory<br> You are a curious man<br> But I will tell you if you want to know<br> Now, so help me, Moses<br> And upon my life<br> That was no lady, that was my wife<br> Hallelujah upon his life<br> That was no lady, it was his wife<br> Mr. Tambo<br> I've a question to ask you tonight<br> And with all your fancy knowledge<br> You should know<br> Mr. Tambo, will you tell us<br> And give us a treat<br> Tell us why does a chicken<br> Cross the street<br> I has studied up my geography<br> Studied up my history<br> Studied up my poultry with pride<br> And I am here to repeat<br> A chicken crosses the street<br> Just to get on the other side<br> Mr. Rooster, don't you hide<br> The chicken crossed the street<br> To reach the other side<br> There's a grand old minstrel man<br> Whose name we hold so dear<br> I know that you'll remember him<br> The moment that you hear<br> Ida, sweet as apple cider<br> Oh, sweeter than all I know<br> Know, know, know, know, know, know<br> Come out, oh, won't you come out<br> In the silvery moonlight<br> Of love we'll whisper so soft and low<br> We were sailing along<br> - We were sailing along<br> - On Moonlight Bay<br> Down the silvery bay<br> We could hear the voices ringing<br> They seemed to say<br> - You have stolen my heart<br> - A maiden's heart<br> - Now, don't go away<br> - Don't you ever go away<br> As we sang love's old sweet song<br> On Moonlight Bay<br> I am here to state<br> I am here to relate<br> To explain and make it plain<br> That I'm just wild about Harry<br> And Harry's wild about me<br> The heavenly blisses of his kisses<br> Fills me with ecstasy<br> He's sweet just like chocolate candy<br> Or like the honey from a bee<br> Oh, I'm just wild about Harry<br> And he's just wild about...<br> Cannot do without<br> He's just wild about me<br> I'm just wild about Mandy<br> And Mandy's wild about me<br> I'm just wild about Harry<br> And Harry's wild about me<br> The heavenly blisses of his kisses<br> Fill me with ecstasy<br> He's sweet just like chocolate candy<br> And just like honey from the bees<br> Wait a minute, folks!<br> Don't go.

For the act?<br> - No, he's through with show business.<br> - Through?<br> That's all he knows.<br> That's all he's good for.<br> He's trying to find something steady.<br> Something we can depend on.<br> Maybe you could sell Mr. Randall<br> a couple of your songs to tide us over.<br> - I was over there this morning.<br> - Well?<br> They got enough songs on the shelf<br> to drive the country crazy.<br> I'll still keep on trying.<br> Maybe Dad is right. Maybe he is through.<br> But I'm not.<br> Show business owes us something<br> and I'm gonna collect.<br> Is that so?<br> We're through. All of us.<br> Starting over.<br> And if ever I hear show business,<br> song writing...<br> ...or that word vaudeville mentioned here,<br> I'll kick the tar out of you.<br> You didn't raise me<br> on that kind of talk.<br> I'll take that rap.<br> I didn't know any better.

What is this?<br> - Haven't you told them yet?<br> - I'll take care of this, thank you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Dad...<br> Dad, you've... You've turned against us.<br> - You, you...<br> - It'll only be for the time being.<br> You'll get education there.<br> I can't do it no other way and<br> I won't let you be a tramp in the streets.<br> Listen, son, you gotta be something.<br> You'll thank me someday, I know you will.<br> Quit talking like that.<br> It makes me sick to hear you.<br> Go on, sign the papers!<br> - But that Steele, she'll never get me!<br> - Shut up.<br> All right, Dad.<br> Here comes Mickey now.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - What's happened?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Something the matter?<br> - What's up?<br> - Anything wrong?<br> They're gonna sign us<br> to the state work school.<br> - They are?<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Did you near that?<br> - Hey, Mickey, here's a letter for you.<br> The mailman just brought it.<br> It's from Harry Maddox.<br> - Say, that's the big producer.<br> - Read it, Mickey.<br> - Yeah, go on.<br> - See what it says.<br> You read it, Don.<br> "Dear Mickey. Your friend, Judge Black,<br> talked me into coming to see your show.<br> It was the only time I came near<br> being drowned and liking it.<br> Drop in and discuss your<br> production with me.<br> Sincerely yours, Harry Maddox."<br> Say, anybody got a dime<br> that I can get to New York with?<br> - Here, I got two bits.<br> - Oh, what a pal.<br> - Come on, let's go to the station with him.<br> - All right.<br> Look what it says in the paper<br> about the show. "Babes In Arms..."<br> Come on, get back on the stage.<br> We got a lot of rehearsing to do. Come on.<br> Hello. Yes, this is the Harry Maddox<br> Theatrical Productions.<br> Yes, ma'am. Yes, we're casting children<br> for the new show.<br> You're welcome.<br> Stage mother. Why doesn't Mr. Maddox<br> produce lbsen instead of kid shows?<br> You got me.<br> Sorry, Mr. Maddox is busy.<br> You'll have to wait.<br> Hello. Yes, Mr. Maddox.<br> No, he hasn't come in yet. Yes, sir.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> - Only casting children today.<br> I'm Joe Moran. Mr. Maddox sent for me.<br> Mr. Moran. Oh, yes, he's expecting you.<br> Please come right this way.<br> Hello, Joe.<br> By golly, it's good to see you.<br> Thanks, Mr. Maddox.<br> Cut it out. Where did you get that<br> Mr. Maddox stuff?<br> - Well, you're a big shot now, Harry.<br> - Apple sauce.<br> You know show business, up today<br> and down tomorrow and back up again.<br> Sit down, sit down, I wanna talk to you.<br> Say, Joe, do you know it's taken me<br> a month to find you?<br> Well, Florrie and me have got<br> a place down near the job.<br> - You know, the kids went out on their own.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yes, I know. They'll...<br> They'll do that, kids will.<br> What I wanted to see you<br> about was this.<br> - I'm in a spot where you can help me out.<br> - Oh, no show business.<br> The world has been changing so rapidly<br> in the last few years, it's kept us all dizzy.<br> The public...<br> The public is like the Frenchman's flea...<br> ...you put your finger on them<br> and boom, they aren't there.<br> They're always hungry<br> for something new.<br> I'm not interested in the public.<br> Didn't talk like that the night Mickey<br> was born, back in the Palace Theater.<br> When everybody in the audience got<br> to be your brother and your sister.<br> Gee, they were great that night.<br> Remember?<br> - Yeah, they were.<br> - A lot of that's come back, Joe.<br> Old-fashioned sentiment's<br> not taboo anymore.<br> And, Joe, a song-and-dance man<br> as great as you are...<br> ...is just as much of a miracle<br> as he ever was.<br> Leave me alone, Harry.<br> I want no part of it.<br> I stood on Broadway corners<br> and watched the business I grew up in...<br> ...that I was good in.<br> I watched it pass me by<br> like I had no place in it.<br> Never turned around to see<br> if your feelings were hurt.<br> Kids had nothing.<br> Home gone.<br> I got up out of the rosin<br> as often as I could.<br> I'm tired.<br> - I'll stay where I am.<br> - You...<br> Kidding yourself that you can live<br> without doing what you were put here for.<br> You mean to say that you think you can<br> keep away from show business? No.<br> Joe, I'm offering you a job.<br> A job where you'll see the people crowding,<br> sure they're gonna have a good time.<br> You get to the theater,<br> you meet your pals...<br> ...you get your makeup on.<br> You hear the orchestra tuning up.<br> The stage manager calls, "First act places,<br> please. Curtain's going up."<br> Then the curtain goes up.<br> Oh, boy, what a thrill.<br> No, Joe. You and I,<br> we can't ever live without it.<br> We know too much about it.<br> What's your proposition, Harry?<br> Well, I've got a show.<br> A new show. A bunch of kids, see?<br> As fresh and sparkling as anything<br> that ever hit Broadway.<br> But, well, they don't know as much about<br> song and dance as they think they do...<br> ...so I want you to teach them.<br> Show them how.<br> Yeah?<br> What do you say?<br> - All right, Harry.<br> - I knew you would.<br> You run home and tell Florrie<br> all about it.
