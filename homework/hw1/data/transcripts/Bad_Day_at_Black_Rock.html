                        Stopping?<br> Man, they look woebegone and faraway.<br> I'll only be here 24 hours.<br> In a place like this, it could be a lifetime.<br> - Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.<br> - Thank you. Thanks very much.<br> You for Black Rock?<br> - That's right.<br> - There must be some mistake.<br> I'm Hastings, the telegraph agent.<br> Nobody told me this train was stopping.<br> - They didn't?<br> - No, I just told you they didn't.<br> And they ought to.<br> What I want to know is, why didn't they?<br> - Maybe they didn't think it was important.<br> - Important?<br> It's the first time the streamliner<br> stopped here in four years.<br> You being met?<br> You visiting folks or something?<br> I mean, what do you want?<br> I want to go to a place called Adobe Flat.<br> Are there any cabs available?<br> Adobe Flat? No cabs.<br> Hotel open?<br> Is the hotel open?<br> Thank you.<br> Pete, now listen.<br> A man just got off the train<br> and asked for Adobe Flat.<br> Afternoon.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> - You run this hotel?<br> - No.<br> Then there's nothing you can do for me.<br> Find Smith.<br> Hello. Like a room.<br> - We're all filled up.<br> - Have you any idea where I could...<br> This is 1945, mister.<br> There's been a war on.<br> It ended a couple of months ago, didn't it?<br> Yeah, but the OPA lingers on.<br> - You don't know about the OPA?<br> - No, you tell me.<br> Well, for establishments<br> with less than 50 rooms...<br> the hotelkeeper's got to report regularly...<br> about tenants and registration.<br> There are penalties imposed.<br> - You seem to have lots of vacancies.<br> - Well, as I said...<br> They're every one of them locked up.<br> Some are showrooms...<br> for feed salesmen, cattle buyers.<br> The rest, they're spoken for.<br> Rented to cowboys, ranch hands<br> for when they come into town.<br> They pay by the month.<br> We provide for their every wish<br> and comfort.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - No, not exactly.<br> But while I'm pondering it,<br> why don't you get a room ready for me?<br> That will be a good one.<br> I'd like to have a bath. Where is it?<br> - At the head of the stairs.<br> - Thank you.<br> I don't know why you're so interested,<br> but the name is Macreedy.<br> - It's all in the ledger.<br> - You look like you need a hand.<br> John J. Macreedy, Los Angeles.<br> I want to know everything he does, Pete.<br> Phone calls, mail...<br> In the meantime?<br> In the meantime, I crowd him a little.<br> See if he's got any iron in his blood.<br> I guess maybe you're in the wrong room.<br> Do you think so?<br> What else you got on your mind?<br> Why, nothing else, I guess.<br> If you had half a mind, boy, you would<br> have paid attention to what Pete said.<br> He said these rooms here<br> is for us cowboys.<br> For our every wish and comfort.<br> - And this one is yours, I guess?<br> - When I'm in town.<br> And I'm in town, as any fool can see.<br> You can see that, can't you, boy?<br> Yes, I guess so.<br> Would you mind<br> if I sort of got my things together...<br> and found another room?<br> Not at all.<br> But if you really wanted this room...<br> we can maybe settle your claim<br> without all this talk.<br> I believe a man's nothing unless<br> he stands up for what's rightfully his.<br> What do you think?<br> - I guess so.<br> - You guess so.<br> But you still ain't claiming this room?<br> No, I guess not.<br> You're all the time guessing,<br> ain't you, boy?<br> Don't you know anything?<br> Well, I know that<br> ever since I got off the train...<br> everybody's been needling me. Why?<br> I guess I rightfully don't know.<br> He walks light for a big man, doesn't he?<br> - Who?<br> - You know who.<br> What do you think, Doc?<br> Why ask me?<br> He's no salesman, that's sure.<br> Unless he's peddling dynamite.<br> Maybe he's a cop or something.<br> - You ever see a cop with a stiff arm?<br> - Maybe his arm's all right.<br> Maybe he's hanging on to something tight<br> in his pocket.<br> Like what? A pistol?<br> A stick of TNT, so he can blow up<br> the whole mangy, miserable town?<br> Why are you so interested, Sam?<br> If I was that interested...<br> I'd ask him.<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> Got any cigarettes?<br> How long you staying?<br> Where? In my new room? I'm staying.<br> I mean, in the hotel.<br> Twenty-four hours, why?<br> Just asking.<br> Why? Are you gonna have a convention?<br> I was just asking.<br> - Where can I get a car?<br> - I don't know.<br> Let's put it this way.<br> Supposing I had a car<br> and I wanted some gas.<br> - Where would I go?<br> - But you don't have a car.<br> You might try that garage<br> down at the end of the street.<br> Thank you.<br> Here we go again.<br> This is all I know about him, Mr. Smith.<br> Sit down, Coley.<br> - I was only...<br> - Sit down.<br> Real cool guy.<br> Doesn't push easy, huh?<br> Well, that's it. That's just it.<br> He pushes too easy.<br> - Maybe we ought...<br> - What do you want, Doc?<br> Nothing. I was just wondering<br> what all you people are worrying about.<br> Not that I have the slightest idea.<br> You wonder too much<br> and you talk too much.<br> It's a bad parlay, Doc.<br> I hold no truck with silence.<br> I've got nothing to hide.<br> - What are you trying to say?<br> - Nothing, man.<br> You worry about the stranger only<br> if you look at him from a certain aspect.<br> How do you look at him, Doc?<br> With the innocence of a fresh-laid egg.<br> Keep it up, Doc. Make bad jokes. Be funny.<br> Someday I'll have Coley<br> wash your mouth out with lye.<br> I called the Circle T.<br> He ain't got business there<br> if they don't know him. Right, Mr. Smith?<br> Send a wire to Nick Gandi in Los Angeles.<br> Tell him to find out everything he can<br> about John J. Macreedy.<br> - What was that?<br> - Nick Gandi, Los Angeles.<br> Tell him I wanna know fast.<br> - Sign my name.<br> - Who was that?<br> Nick Gandi.<br> G-A-N-D-I. Blake Hotel.<br> You get the rest of it?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All right. Sign my name.<br> Who's Gandi?<br> Private detective.<br> I drive to LA now and then.<br> This guy Gandi can get us the dope?<br> He can get us anything we want<br> for $20 a day and expenses.<br> Don't get too nervous too fast, Hector.<br> - It's just I don't like it.<br> - Maybe he's just passing through.<br> Don't bet on it. He can mean only trouble.<br> Hector, you're jumpy as a stall horse.<br> We ought to see him. Talk to him.<br> About what?<br> What will I talk to him about?<br> The birds, the bees,<br> the crops, the weather?<br> You tried it. What'd it get you?<br> - It's just I thought that...<br> - You just thought.<br> Well, what'll we do?<br> What'll you do?<br> You'll wait, just like Pete here.<br> That right, Pete? And that's all you'll do.<br> - And while you wait, I'll talk to him.<br> - Hey, what do you know?<br> Mr. Macreedy seems to be heading<br> for the jail.<br> Now, what do you suppose<br> he'd wanna talk to the sheriff about?<br> Hold it, friend.<br> I ain't hankering to get locked<br> in my own jail.<br> I'm sorry, I thought you were a guest.<br> As it happens, I'm the host.<br> - Snort?<br> - No, thank you.<br> I don't blame you. It's awful.<br> What are you looking at?<br> - You tell me.<br> - I ain't always this bad.<br> It's just that last night me and my pal,<br> Doc Velie, did a little celebrating.<br> What were you celebrating?<br> Well, you name it.<br> What do you want?<br> My name is Macreedy.<br> I came in on the streamliner.<br> You what?<br> - I say, I came in on the...<br> - You ain't from around here.<br> Are you up Phoenix way?<br> Tucson? Mesa?<br> You ain't selling cattle nor seed corn,<br> nothing like that?<br> No, all I want from you<br> is a little information.<br> I have to go to a place called Adobe Flat.<br> This ain't no information bureau.<br> That's one thing about Black Rock:<br> Everybody is polite.<br> That makes for very gracious living.<br> - Nobody asked you here.<br> - How do you know?<br> - What about Adobe Flat?<br> - I'm looking for a man named Komako.<br> - Almost a disaster.<br> - Yeah, a fate worse than death.<br> You move fast for a crip...<br> For a big man.<br> How about Komako?<br> If there are no further questions...<br> Greetings.<br> That's the first pleasant word I've heard<br> since I got here.<br> My name is Smith.<br> I own the Three-Bar Ranch.<br> I want to apologize<br> for some of the people in town.<br> They act like they are sitting on a keg.<br> A keg? Of what?<br> I don't know:<br> Diamonds, gunpowder.<br> It's nothing like that.<br> We're suspicious of strangers is all.<br> Hangover from the old days. The Old West.<br> I thought the tradition of the Old West<br> was hospitality.<br> I'm trying to be hospitable, Mr. Macreedy.<br> - You going to be around long?<br> - Could be.<br> How'd you like to go hunting tomorrow?<br> I'd be proud to have you as my guest.<br> Thanks. I'm afraid I can't.<br> Because of your arm, I suppose.<br> I knew a man who lost his arm once<br> in a threshing accident.<br> He used to hunt all the time.<br> He was quite a man. He...<br> Sorry. If there's anything I can do<br> while you're around...<br> No, I was just looking for...<br> No, it doesn't matter.<br> You were looking for what, Mr. Macreedy?<br> I was looking for a man named Komako.<br> Komako. Sure, I remember him.<br> Japanese farmer. Never had a chance.<br> Got here in '41, just before Pearl Harbor.<br> Three months later, they shipped him off<br> to a relocation center.<br> Tough.<br> You don't happen to remember<br> which one they sent him to, do you?<br> Who knows?<br> Why don't you try writing him?<br> Glad to help you out.<br> I'm afraid you'd be wasting your time.<br> I've already written...<br> but they don't forward my letters.<br> They keep sending them back.<br> They do?<br> - Need any help?<br> - I can manage.<br> Well, I need a little help.<br> I'd like to rent your jeep.<br> That'll be $2 an hour. Gas extra.<br> - $10 for my time.<br> - Why not ask him where he wants to go?<br> He wants to go to Adobe Flat.<br> Is the road marked well?<br> Yeah, it's about six or seven miles down.<br> Fine, then I won't need your time.<br> - I thought you might need a little help.<br> - Oh, no.<br> I'll get along fine, thank you.<br> Liz, do you have a license to hire cars?<br> You might get into trouble.<br> I won't say a word to the sheriff.<br> You shouldn't have done that.<br> Thought it would be better if he went and<br> got done with it. What can he find out?<br> I wouldn't do anything to hurt you, Reno.<br> You know that.<br> This is liable to be the hardest $10<br> you ever earned in your life.<br> - What do you want?<br> - He asked about Komako.<br> - Do you think he'll kick up a storm?<br> - A storm?<br> - What about?<br> - I don't know.<br> All I know is that<br> I don't want no more trouble around here.<br> Never again, trouble.<br> You don't know anything about Komako,<br> do you?<br> I do not. That's the point.<br> The point is, what you don't know<br> won't hurt you.<br> Maybe there's something I ought to know.<br> Maybe there's something<br> I ought to ask you...<br> before the stranger returns<br> and starts breathing down my neck.<br> Tim, you're just a lost ball<br> in the high weeds.<br> I told you a long time ago,<br> nothing happened for you to worry about.<br> The thing is, I do worry.<br> Maybe I ain't much else,<br> but I'm sure a worrier.<br> And I'm still the law.<br> Then do your job, Tim.<br> What is my job, Mr. Smith?<br> I'd better find out<br> before Macreedy does it for me.<br> Macreedy will do nothing.<br> And neither will you, Tim.<br> - Suppose I decide to try.<br> - That might be dangerous.<br> You got the body of a hippo<br> but the brain of a rabbit. Don't overtax it.<br> Yes, Mr. Smith.<br> Tim, buy you a cup of coffee?<br> - From LA?<br> - Yeah, from that private detective.<br> What does he say?<br> Who is this guy, anyway?<br> Never heard of him, that's what he says.<br> He checked. There's no John J. Macreedy.<br> No listing, no record,<br> no information, nothing.<br> Where does that leave us?<br> I'll tell you where it leaves us.<br> I'm sick and...<br> Now, Coley.<br> - I think Macreedy's a nothing. A nobody.<br> - Is he?<br> - So there's nothing to worry about.<br> - Isn't there?<br> You got brains, you have.<br> What can he find out? That Komako...<br> Suppose he finds out.<br> A nobody like Macreedy<br> can raise a pretty big stink.<br> The point is,<br> who'd miss a nobody like Macreedy...<br> if he just, say, disappeared?<br> Who, Coley?<br> - Why don't we wait?<br> - Wait for what?<br> I mean, maybe he won't find anything.<br> Maybe he'll just go away.<br> Not Macreedy. I know those maimed guys.<br> Their minds get twisted.<br> They put on hair shirts<br> and act like martyrs.<br> All of them are do-gooders,<br> freaks, troublemakers.<br> Let's wait and see. There's no danger yet.<br> "No danger," he says.<br> This guy is like a carrier of smallpox.<br> Since he's arrived, this town has a fever.<br> An infection.<br> And it's spreading.<br> Hastings in a sick sweat,<br> running around, shooting off his face.<br> Doc getting snotty with me<br> for the first time in four years.<br> - And Liz, your sister, acts like a fool.<br> - She's only a kid.<br> Kid? She must have strained<br> every muscle in her head...<br> to get so stupid, renting him a jeep.<br> Tim the rumdum...<br> suddenly decides<br> he's got to act like a sheriff.<br> And he says there's no danger.<br> Of course,<br> if you want to take the chance...<br> - Not me.<br> - All right, then.<br> You're mighty quick to kill.<br> He's not an animal.<br> Well, listen to the little spitfire.<br> You miserable little toad.<br> I'm saving your neck.<br> - Lf I don't, who will? Tim? Doc?<br> - All l...<br> Your sister with the rocks in her head?<br> There's one thing about her.<br> She's got twice the guts you have.<br> - You're only fit for running away.<br> - And it's too late for that.<br> He's in this, and he ain't running no place.<br> All right, then.<br> Let Smith find himself a new boy.<br> I can't take it another day.<br> If you're a sheriff, they gotta respect you.<br> Otherwise you can't do your job.<br> They just laugh.<br> I don't laugh, Tim.<br> - Why don't you?<br> - Cut it out, Tim.<br> You should.<br> In the name of well-adjusted manhood,<br> get a hold of yourself.<br> Snap out of it. You're gonna have<br> a complex or something.<br> Four years ago, if I'd have done my job...<br> if I'd checked up<br> and found out what happened...<br> But I didn't. It was just like Smith figured.<br> What did you find out? They told you<br> a story, you had to believe it.<br> Would you believe it?<br> I don't know.<br> I live a quiet, contemplative life.<br> Me, I didn't even try to find out.<br> Don't you understand?<br> When you wear this badge, you're the law.<br> When someone does something<br> against the law...<br> then you're supposed to<br> do something about it.<br> Me, I did nothing.<br> That's what's eating me.<br> What kind of prescription you got for that?<br> I don't know.<br> Haven't found one for myself.<br> But there's one thing, Tim: Don't quit!<br> Why not?<br> Because maybe this fellow Macreedy's<br> got the prescription.<br> Well, if it's not Macreedy...<br> the world's champion road hog.<br> - Yeah, it's a small world.<br> - But such an unfriendly one.<br> Why'd you wanna crowd me off the road?<br> I'm sorry if I incurred your displeasure.<br> Look what you did to my car.<br> Anything I can do to make it up?<br> You ought to be more careful, man.<br> All that one-arm driving.<br> I'll be glad to pay for the damages.<br> It's a threat to life and limb.<br> Fortunately, no one was hurt.<br> You could get yourself killed that way,<br> nosing all over the countryside.<br> I guess that's a danger, all right.<br> That's pretty smart of you.<br> How long do you intend to keep it up?<br> I'm pulling out right now.<br> - Still expecting that convention?<br> - What?<br> If you're expecting any extra cowboys,<br> my room is available.<br> Are you checking out?<br> Any trains leaving tonight?<br> - Tomorrow morning. The streamliner.<br> - I know about that.<br> Milk train or freights?<br> - Tomorrow, after the streamliner.<br> - Buses?<br> Closest stop is Sand City, 32 miles away.<br> You're in such a hurry,<br> you should have never got off here.<br> I'm inclined to agree with you.<br> If you're looking for the keys to the jeep,<br> they're not there.<br> - Where would you suggest I look?<br> - The jeep's not for rent.<br> - Why, it was just a few hours ago.<br> - Things change.<br> Sure do.<br> And Smith is the kid<br> who changes them, isn't he?<br> You mind if I use this?<br> Yeah, go ahead.<br> What's wrong with this town of yours,<br> Miss Wirth?<br> Nothing's wrong with this town,<br> Mr. Macreedy.<br> It's none of your concern.<br> Why is everybody so concerned<br> about me then?<br> - Am I concerned?<br> - No, you're not, but...<br> But what?<br> I have a feeling<br> you're a little bit too unconcerned.<br> You're so unconcerned,<br> you won't even rent me a jeep.<br> I don't own a taxi service.<br> I don't have a license.<br> Too bad everybody in this town...<br> isn't as scrupulously devoted<br> to law and order as you are.<br> I don't want to get involved.<br> - Involved in what?<br> - Whatever you're up to!<br> Whatever happens,<br> I've got to go on living in this town.<br> These people are my neighbors,<br> my friends.<br> All of them?<br> This is my town, Mr. Macreedy.<br> Like it or not.<br> Well, if you don't like it,<br> why do you stick around?<br> My brother, Pete, he'd never leave.<br> Did it ever occur to you<br> that you might leave without him?<br> You look like an independent young lady.<br> Your brother seems...<br> Weak? I know.<br> That's why I couldn't leave him.<br> What did your brother do?<br> What do you care?<br> What do you care about Black Rock?<br> I don't care anything about Black Rock.<br> Only it seems to me that there aren't<br> many towns like this in America.<br> But one town like it is enough.<br> And because I think something kind of bad<br> happened here, Miss Wirth.<br> Something they can't quite seem<br> to find a handle to.<br> - You don't know what you're saying.<br> - Well, I know this much.<br> The rule of law has left here<br> and the gorillas have taken over.<br> Yeah, and you just tried to steal<br> the key to my jeep.<br> I figured that<br> that was the only way I could get it.<br> Was I wrong, Miss Wirth?<br> I'd like to ask you a few questions<br> while you're around.<br> I'm around, all right.<br> I guess probably you've heard...<br> that Miss Wirth is no longer<br> in the car rental business.<br> Good. I wouldn't want to see that girl<br> get into trouble.<br> - Wouldn't you?<br> - What with rental permits...<br> gas rationing, you know what I mean.<br> Yeah, I certainly admire<br> your sturdy sense of responsibility.<br> It's just that, that girl has a future.<br> Let's talk about my future.<br> - Do you think you have the time?<br> - I don't seem to be going anywhere.<br> I hear you handle a jeep real well.<br> Yes, I do have a way with jeeps.<br> A certain familiarity.<br> I think I understand. You're an army man.<br> - Where'd you get it?<br> - Italy.<br> That's tough.<br> I tried to enlist myself the day after<br> those rats bombed Pearl Harbor.<br> What stopped you?<br> Physical. They wouldn't take me.<br> Morning after Pearl, I was the first man<br> at Marine Recruiting in Sand City.<br> They wouldn't take me.<br> Tough.<br> What do you do in Los Angeles,<br> Mr. Macreedy?<br> I'm retired.<br> You might say<br> I was forced into retirement.<br> What were you looking for in Adobe Flat?<br> Like I told you, I was looking<br> for a fellow named Komako.<br> And like you told me, he wasn't there.<br> - What's so funny?<br> - Nothing.<br> Just I don't believe you.<br> I believe a man is as big<br> as what he is seeking.<br> I believe you are a big man, Mr. Macreedy.<br> Flattery will get you nowhere.<br> Why would a man like you<br> be looking for a lousy Jap farmer?<br> - You can't tell. Maybe I'm not so big.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> I believe a man is as big<br> as what will make him mad.<br> Nobody around here seems big enough<br> to get you mad.<br> - What makes you mad, Mr. Smith?<br> - Me?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You're a pretty big man yourself.<br> - The Japanese make you mad, don't they?<br> - Well, that's different.<br> After that sneak attack<br> on Pearl Harbor. Bataan.<br> - Komako made you mad?<br> - It's the same thing.<br> Loyal Japanese-Americans. That's a laugh.<br> They're all mad dogs.<br> What about Corregidor, the Death March?<br> What did Komako<br> have to do with Corregidor?<br> He was a Jap, wasn't he?<br> Look, Mr. Macreedy.<br> There's a law in this county<br> against shooting dogs.<br> But when I see a mad dog,<br> I don't wait for him to bite me.<br> I swear,<br> you're beginning to make me mad.<br> All strangers do.<br> No, they don't. Not all of them.<br> Some do<br> when they come around snooping.<br> - Snooping for what?<br> - I don't know.<br> Outsiders coming in<br> looking for something.<br> - Looking for what?<br> - I don't know!<br> Somebody's always looking for something<br> in this part of the West.<br> To the historian, it's the Old West.<br> To the book writer, it's the Wild West.<br> To the businessman,<br> it's the Undeveloped West.<br> They say we're all poor and backward,<br> and I guess we are.<br> We don't even have enough water.<br> But to us, this place is our West.<br> And I wish they'd leave us alone.<br> Leave you alone to do what?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> What happened to Komako?<br> He went away. I told you.<br> Shortly after he left, some kids<br> went out there. They got fooling around.<br> They burned his place down. That's how<br> it was. You know how kids are.<br> - What's so funny?<br> - Nothing.<br> It's just that I don't believe you...<br> any more than I believed you<br> about the letters.<br> You don't seem to believe anything I say.<br> Yes, I believe you about<br> what you say about the businessmen...<br> being interested in Adobe Flat.<br> Why?<br> Well, I would think<br> they would be interested...<br> maybe some historian,<br> in all that land lying fallow.<br> You know, it could be used<br> for some purpose, maybe a graveyard.<br> There's something buried up there.<br> You have wildflowers.<br> That means a grave.<br> I suppose you knew that.<br> I saw a lot of it overseas.<br> Figured it wasn't a human grave<br> because it wasn't marked.<br> Kind of a mystery, isn't it?<br> Kind of.<br> Maybe you can figure it out.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Why don't you give it a whirl?<br> It might help you pass the time<br> for a while.<br> Well, I've got other things to do.<br> I'm not interested.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> - Pull up a chair.<br> - Can I use your phone?<br> Yeah, help yourself.<br> You're one of the few people<br> who's been back here I can say that to.<br> It's 424.<br> What's 424?<br> If I've got you pegged, and I think I have,<br> you're calling the State Police.<br> But if I was you,<br> and I'm surely glad I'm not...<br> I'd look it up myself.<br> I wouldn't trust anybody around here.<br> Including me.<br> Don't tell me, I know.<br> The lines are all busy. Be busy all day.<br> - You mind not looking at me like that?<br> - Like what?<br> Like a potential customer.<br> Everybody is.<br> And I get them coming and going.<br> First, I sell them a piece of land.<br> Do you think they farm it?<br> They do not. They dig for gold.<br> They rip off the topsoil<br> of 10 winding hills...<br> then sprint in here all fog-heaved<br> with excitement, lugging nuggets...<br> big, bright, and shiny.<br> Is it gold? It is not.<br> Do they quit? They do not.<br> Then they decide to farm.<br> Farm in a country so dry that you<br> have to prime a man before he can spit.<br> Before you can say "Fat Sam,"<br> they're stalled, stranded, and starving.<br> They become weevil-brained<br> and butt-sprung.<br> So I bury them.<br> But why bore you with my triumphs?<br> - I got a problem of my own.<br> - You sure have.<br> They're gonna kill you<br> with no hard feelings.<br> And you're gonna sit there<br> and let them do it.<br> - Don't get waspish with me, mister.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I feel for you.<br> But I'm consumed with apathy.<br> - Why should I mix in?<br> - I don't know. Maybe to save a life.<br> I've got enough trouble<br> saving my own. Look.<br> I try to live right.<br> I drink my milk every day.<br> But mostly I try to mind<br> my own business...<br> which is something I advise you to do.<br> It's a little late for that.<br> No, you can still get out of town.<br> But you'd better get out like a whisper.<br> How?<br> I've got sort of a limousine<br> at your disposal.<br> Where is it?<br> Must be something wrong.<br> Could be the wiring.<br> Yeah, it's the wiring.<br> Now, wasn't that a good guess?<br> Maybe it can be fixed.<br> Easy. Except maybe if this wire<br> was busted or something.<br> Do the nice little things, like keep<br> your big, fat nose out of my business.<br> Yeah, it was the wiring.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - But you gotta admit, I tried.<br> - And for that, I thank you.<br> How much time do you think I've got<br> before they...<br> You've got at least till dark.<br> They'd be afraid to see each other's faces.<br> Well, thanks, Doc.<br> - I can't say that it's been charming...<br> - Where are you going?<br> I don't know, but I'm going on foot.<br> That's no good.<br> You stray 10 yards off the main street...<br> and you'll be stone-cold dead.<br> That's the situation in a nut.<br> Maybe...<br> Maybe what?<br> I'll see you later, Doc.<br> Lemonade?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - It's hot as Billy-be-durned.<br> - Don't you like lemonade?<br> - Never thought much about it.<br> You notifying the State Police?<br> That's what it says.<br> You sure you don't want some lemonade?<br> It don't have the muzzle velocity<br> of other drinks here...<br> but it's good for what ails you.<br> - What ails you, Mr. Hastings?<br> - Me?<br> Why are you so upset about this wire?<br> - Me?<br> - Are you afraid, Mr. Hastings?<br> Mr. Macreedy, I'm just a good neighbor.<br> To Smith, you are.<br> What about to Komako?<br> I've never seen Komako in my life. Honest.<br> All right.<br> Then you'll send that message<br> and give me the answer, won't you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - What've you got?<br> Chili and beans.<br> - Anything else?<br> - Chili without beans.<br> If you don't like the flavor, there's ketchup.<br> All right, I'll have it. A cup of coffee.<br> Well, you still around?<br> I thought you didn't like this place.<br> - You mean going to or coming from?<br> - Staying put.<br> - No comment.<br> - "No comment," he says.<br> No comment,<br> and all the time he's got my stool.<br> This stool ain't comfortable.<br> I was afraid of that.<br> I think I'd like the one you're on.<br> He's as changeable as a prairie fire.<br> Suppose you tell me where to sit.<br> I hope that ain't too much.<br> Your friend's a very argumentative fellow.<br> Sort of unpredictable, too.<br> Got a temper like a rattlesnake.<br> That's me all over.<br> I'm half-horse, half-alligator.<br> You mess with me<br> and I'll kick a lung out of you.<br> What do you think of that?<br> No comment.<br> Talking to you is like pulling teeth.<br> You wear me out.<br> You're a yellow-bellied Jap lover!<br> Am I right or wrong?<br> You're not only wrong,<br> you're wrong at the top of your voice.<br> You don't like my voice?<br> I think your friend<br> is trying to start trouble.<br> Why ever would he want to do that?<br> I don't know. Maybe he thinks...<br> that if he needles me enough,<br> I might crack. I might even fight back.<br> Then either he or your other ape<br> sitting over there could beat me to death...<br> and cop a plea of self-defense.<br> I don't think that'll be necessary.<br> You're so scared now,<br> you'll probably drown in your own sweat.<br> Before that happens...<br> couldn't I pick a fight with you<br> if I tied one hand behind me?<br> If I tied both hands?<br> Wouldn't it have been easier to wait<br> until I turned my back...<br> or are there too many witnesses present?<br> You're still in trouble.<br> You're in trouble.<br> Whatever happens, you're sunk.<br> You got things a bit twisted.<br> You killed Komako, Smith.<br> Sooner or later, you're gonna go up for it.<br> Not because you killed him...<br> because in a town like this<br> you can get away with it.<br> But because you didn't have the guts<br> to do it alone...<br> you put your trust in guys like this<br> and Hector here.<br> Not the most dependable<br> of God's creatures.<br> One of these days, they're gonna catch on<br> you're playing them for a sap. Then what?<br> Peel them off one by one?<br> Meantime, one of them is gonna crack...<br> and when they do, you're gonna go down.<br> But hard.<br> Because they got something<br> on you, Smith.<br> Something to use<br> when the going gets tough.<br> And it's getting tougher every minute.<br> Man, oh, man.<br> - Anything come for me?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Telegram or nothing?<br> - Nothing.<br> In case you're interested, Coley will live,<br> I'm truly sorry to say.<br> Your friend's pretty tough.<br> Yeah, he's wicked.<br> He defends himself when he's attacked.<br> You gonna sit there and let time run out?<br> Waiting for an answer from the state cops.<br> You send it through Hastings?<br> Just don't expect an answer,<br> if that's the way you sent it.<br> I guess that's probably for me.<br> Where's my answer?<br> Do you expect an answer<br> from a wire that was never sent?<br> What's so funny?<br> I just had a thought.<br> A thought that is dazzling in its purity.<br> You're in a lot of trouble.<br> You gave my message to Smith,<br> didn't you?<br> Why, you little wart!<br> That's a federal offense.<br> You're in this deep, too.<br> Like I say,<br> it's getting tougher and tougher.<br> Maybe you'd better do something<br> about this, Sheriff.<br> I reckon that's right, Mr. Smith.<br> You're not supposed to...<br> Don't be a jerk, Tim.<br> Divulging information?<br> There's a law that says you...<br> Tim, you're pathetic.<br> Maybe so, but I'm still sheriff.<br> That's the point.<br> You're not sheriff anymore.<br> You're so pathetic, you just lost a job.<br> Okay, Sheriff...<br> take over.<br> - You can't do that!<br> - I can't?<br> I put him in the job,<br> and now I'm taking him out.<br> Now, do you wanna register<br> a complaint, boy?<br> To register a complaint,<br> you've got to have evidence, boy.<br> You got evidence?<br> You got a big mouth, boy.<br> Making accusations<br> and disturbing the peace.<br> We got a law in this county protecting<br> innocent folks from bigmouths like you.<br> - I'd hate to...<br> - Hector.<br> Never mind, Tim. We're not licked yet.<br> Ain't we? I am.<br> There comes a time, Tim...<br> when a man has just got to do something.<br> Not me. I'm useless and I know it.<br> No man is useless<br> so long as he's got a friend.<br> I'm your friend, Tim.<br> Then why don't you let me alone?<br> Because he's going to need you<br> before the night's over.<br> And all the useful men<br> are on the other side.<br> Let me alone, I tell you!<br> I can't let you alone!<br> I can't let myself alone.<br> Don't you understand that?<br> Four years ago,<br> something terrible happened here.<br> We did nothing about it. Nothing!<br> The whole town fell into<br> a sort of settled melancholy...<br> and all the people in it closed their eyes<br> and held their tongues...<br> and failed the test with a whimper.<br> Now something terrible<br> is going to happen again.<br> And in a way, we're lucky,<br> 'cause we've been given a second chance.<br> I've got such a headache, I'm bewildered.<br> I hurt all over.<br> Yeah, pain is bewildering. I know.<br> I was bewildered when I came here.<br> Full of self-pity.<br> But your friend Smith tried to kill me.<br> It's strange how a man<br> will cling to the earth...<br> when he feels<br> he isn't going to see it again.<br> There's lot of difference between<br> clinging to it and crawling on the earth.<br> Are you going to stand by<br> and watch forever?<br> I ain't gonna watch.<br> And I ain't gonna get into anything.<br> I'm getting out.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Macreedy.<br> You'd be smart to get out, too, Doc.<br> There's too many smart guys around here.<br> I'm glad I'm a dummy.<br> You're a troublesome dummy.<br> You're liable to end up on your own slab.<br> I expect to be in a lot more trouble<br> before I die...<br> Go home, Doc. He's all washed-up.<br> You think so?<br> I was washed-up when I got off that train.<br> - You shouldn't have got off.<br> - I had to.<br> I had one last duty to perform<br> before I resigned from the human race.<br> I thought you were going to Los Angeles.<br> That hotbed of pomp and vanity.<br> Is that what you call<br> resigning from the human race?<br> Good jumping-off place<br> for South America, the islands.<br> Why?<br> I don't know. I guess I was just looking<br> for some place to get lost.<br> Why do you want to get lost?<br> Because I was afraid<br> I couldn't function any longer.<br> Luckily, your friend Smith<br> changed my mind.<br> - Sure, you're a man of action.<br> - I know what your trouble is, sonny.<br> You'd like me to die quickly, wouldn't you?<br> Without wasting too much of your time.<br> Or quietly,<br> so I won't embarrass you too much.<br> Or even thankfully...<br> so your memory of the occasion<br> won't be too unpleasant.<br> My memories are so pleasant, as it is.<br> It's gonna take an awful lot of whiskey<br> to wash out your guts.<br> Go on, swill it!<br> What is there left for you to do?<br> You're as dead as Komako,<br> and you don't know it.<br> Take it easy. Sit down.<br> Sit down?<br> Why don't you tell me to kneel down...<br> and beg his pardon<br> for bringing up an unpleasant subject?<br> You don't have to remind me.<br> I've never forgotten.<br> Isn't that noble of you?<br> You haven't forgotten and<br> you're ashamed. That's really noble of you.<br> I suppose four years from now,<br> you'll be sitting here...<br> telling people<br> you haven't forgotten me, either.<br> That's real progress.<br> In the meantime, I'll be as dead as a...<br> Why don't you tell me what happened?<br> What happened?<br> Why did you come here, Mr. Macreedy?<br> Did Komako have any other family<br> besides his son, Joe?<br> Son? Nobody around here<br> ever knew he had a son.<br> Yes, he had a son. He's dead, too.<br> He's buried in Italy.<br> I asked you before:<br> Why did you come here?<br> Why, this Komako boy died<br> trying to save my life.<br> They gave him a medal.<br> I came here to give it to his old man.<br> I figured the least I could do<br> was give him one day out of my life.<br> Well, are you gonna tell him<br> or have I got to?<br> I'll tell him.<br> Smith owned Adobe Flat.<br> He leased it to Komako.<br> He figured he cheated him because<br> you gotta have water to raise anything.<br> There never was any water on Adobe Flat.<br> Komako dug a well.<br> He must have gone down 60 feet.<br> He got plenty of water.<br> That made Smith pretty sore.<br> He didn't like Japs anyway.<br> The day after Pearl Harbor,<br> Smith went to Sand City.<br> Yeah, he got turned down. Tried to enlist.<br> When he got back, he was pretty sore.<br> Around 10:00, we all started drinking.<br> Smith, Coley, Sam, Hector, and me.<br> We were all drunk.<br> Patriotic drunk.<br> We wanted to go out to scare<br> the Jap a little and have a little fun.<br> When we got there,<br> he heard us coming and locked the door.<br> Then Smith started a fire...<br> and the Jap came running out.<br> His clothes were all burning.<br> And then Smith shot him.<br> I didn't even know he had a gun.<br> Then you got scared and buried him,<br> and kept your mouth shut?<br> Yeah.<br> Well, go ahead and have your drink.<br> You're going to need it.<br> Hello, Liz. Pete.<br> Listen, I'm getting Macreedy out of town.<br> I would call the police,<br> but all the outside lines are cut.<br> Let him try. I might as well be dead.<br> Yeah, I told him everything.<br> Never mind about that.<br> I'm asking you because I need your help.<br> You'd be saving two lives, Liz:<br> Macreedy's and mine,<br> if that means anything to you.<br> All right.<br> Now, here's what I want you to do.<br> Wait till it's dark.<br> I've been looking for you. Come here.<br> What do you want?<br> Macreedy. He went up to bed.<br> So, you want me to tuck him in?<br> No, but I thought<br> maybe you ought to tell Smith.<br> Smith don't want to be disturbed.<br> He'll be here at midnight, he said.<br> Why are you so nervous?<br> What do you mean? I'm not nervous.<br> You got a match?<br> No, I got some in the lobby.<br> What did you do to get Pete<br> to change his mind? Beat him up?<br> No, no muscle.<br> Not with brains, either.<br> He's a pushover for a muscleman.<br> I'm beginning to think<br> it runs in the family.<br> I'd sure like to have seen you tangle<br> with Reno Smith.<br> He didn't happen to be there when I left.<br> Maybe I will yet.<br> - What's this?<br> - Need water.<br> Smitty?<br> Liz, you fool.<br> If he gets me, he's gotta get you.<br> I'm here, honey. Head for the car.<br> So long, Macreedy.<br> A few more steps, honey.<br> Get him. Get him now.<br> First things first, honey.<br> Help me up, Smitty.<br> You were gonna help me, Liz.<br> I still need your help.<br> I did everything you said.<br> You two started out in the car.<br> And that's the way you're gonna end up.<br> Over a cliff, burning.<br> You can blame Macreedy for that.<br> He said I had too many witnesses.<br> Why me? Why start with me?<br> I gotta start with somebody.<br> Save me!<br> Am I going to have trouble with you?<br> No. But I sure thought the situation<br> was gonna be reversed.<br> I thought that<br> I was gonna have trouble with him.<br> I'll take care of him.<br> The gang's all here, all right.<br> Thought I'd take one last whack at my job.<br> Your sister's out in the car, Pete.<br> She's dead.<br> Do you want me to tell you who killed her?<br> I know who killed her.<br> About that medal? Can we have it?<br> - "Can we have it?" Who's "we"?<br> - We. Us.<br> Why?<br> Maybe we need it.<br> Maybe give us something to build on.<br> This town's wrecked,<br> just as though it was bombed out.<br> Maybe it can come back.<br> Some towns do, and some towns don't.<br> Depends on the people.<br> That medal would help.<br> Thanks, Mr. Macreedy.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> What's all the excitement?<br> What happened?<br> - A shooting.<br> - Thought it was something.<br> First time the streamliner's stopped here<br> in four years.<br> Second time.<br> English<br>
