Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> After all, I guess<br> nature made men that way.<br> It's their great weakness.<br> And how we women<br> encourage that weakness.<br> - Well, I don't.<br> - Oh, no.

I've got something to show ya.<br> - What?<br> - There's a fella over here who won't flirt.<br> - There ain't no such animal.<br> - On the level.<br> - His wife must be watching him.<br> No, he's all alone.<br> A girl can't get a tumble.<br> A girl can't get a tumble?<br> Wanna bet a quarter?<br> - That you can make him speak to you?<br> - Yeah!<br> - All right.

Do you have to do that?<br> - I'm singin'.<br> - I had an aunt once who used to make noises like that.<br> She called it neuraliga. "<br> Neuralgia must run in your family.<br> Yeah? Well, listen, kid.<br> If you want to prove that something<br> runs in your family, this is the spot.<br> You got a clear deck.<br> - I don't know whether I won or not.<br> - I'll ask him.<br> Hey, mister.

So some guy can get an eyeful.<br> And your dress is deliberately made<br> for the wind to blow up over your knees.<br> Listen, sister. If you don't want guys<br> to salute ya, take down your flag.<br> You're like all other janes.<br> If a guy makes a pass at ya,<br> you wanna call out the police.<br> And if he don't,<br> you wanna call the army.<br> - You don't seem to like me.<br> - I think you're a pain in the neck.<br> Well, my name is Dorothy Haley.<br> You ain't kiddin' me a bit.<br> You're like all the other fellas.<br> You just have a new line.

Everything<br> lives in this house.<br> Nobody'll speak to her<br> anymore but me.<br> It makes my brother sore when I do.<br> But as Edna says, nobody knows whether a person's<br> good or bad but the person themselves.<br> And they won't tell.<br> This Edna jane does most of<br> your thinking, don't she?<br> Edna's swell.

Your wife will enjoy that.<br> - Oh, I haven't any wife.<br> - Oh.<br> - That's why I'm able to pay $300 for a radio.<br> Well, there's something to that.

Do you suppose any man<br> would ever marry if he thought of it?<br> Why, I can't even talk to a girl.<br> You know, it's funny<br> about me that way.<br> I'd like to be nice to women.<br> You know, say nice things to them,<br> like fellas can.<br> I can't though.<br> I think of nice things to say.<br> But when it comes to putting 'em into words-<br> I only say something<br> sarcastic and mean.<br> - Hello?<br> - But me get married?<br> - That's a laugh.<br> - Well, I hope so.<br> Yeah. Hey, sheikh.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, stupid.<br> How are ya?<br> Sure, it's me.<br> Yeah.

Sweet job, huh?<br> Come here, and I'll show you<br> what I had to do with it.<br> What do I care what you had to<br> do with it? I'm not Marconi...<br> or Edison or whoever<br> invented the thing.<br> - I'm standing out there-<br> - All right. My mistake.<br> Radio's my job.<br> I'm gonna have my own store soon.<br> - I thought you were interested in my work.<br> - I am interested, Eddie.<br> But, gee, I got a right to be sore,<br> standing out in the rain like that.<br> Well, after all,<br> you can't saw sawdust.<br> What kind of a crack is that?<br> You can't saw sawdust. "<br> I mean it's done.<br> All I can do is say that I'm sorry.<br> - Do you forgive me?<br> - Well, I got a right to be sore.<br> All right.

All men are alike.<br> They puff themselves up.<br> You'd think they'd done something.<br> - Oh, I hope he'll really be like that.<br> - He wlll be.<br> I don't know though.<br> He's always yelling about living in a tenement...<br> and what a sin it is to have children<br> if you can't afford to give 'em everything.<br> I don't think I read anything in the papers<br> about him being born in the White House.<br> He was awful poor.<br> That's why he thinks like that about it.<br> Here he is.<br> Don't say anything.<br> - You still here?<br> - No.<br> Dld you get your paper, Eddle?<br> I got down there,<br> and I didn't have any change.<br> You can get one next week.

The way you run<br> people's business for them...<br> if you start buttin' in, I'll probably<br> end up ownin' a butcher shop.<br> Well, I'm going.<br> - Remember now.

Is that it?<br> - Oh, it's all right.<br> But I wish we had a flat of our own or<br> something-you know, our own furniture.<br> Can't you see, Eddie? If I went to work,<br> you could have your store just the same.<br> And with the money I make,<br> we could-<br> Do you think I'd take money<br> you worked for?<br> - Oh, it'd be all right.<br> - Not with me, it wouldn't.<br> My idea of a husband is a guy that looks<br> after his wife and takes care of her...<br> and sees that<br> she don't want for nothin'.<br> If I can't do that,<br> I won't be a husband.<br> Me take your money-<br> you work all day-<br> or let you use it for something<br> that I ought to be payin' for.<br> Listen. They got a name<br> for guys like that.<br> Oh, Eddie, I didn't mean<br> to make you sore.<br> I ain't sore.<br> But I ain't as happy as I was.<br> You can lay that on a line.<br> It was our 10 weeks anniversary.<br> And I had the store<br> all picked out and everything.<br> And, say, when I come in here tonight,<br> I was walkin' on air.<br> This kinda crumbs it all up.<br> Gee, I didn't know<br> you wasn't satisfied.<br> Oh, Eddie, I am satisfied.<br> It's all right.<br> Let's not talk about it.<br> - I'll bet that Edna jane put that idea in your nut.<br> - No, she didn't.<br> Let's not say any more about it.<br> You're crazy to have the store,<br> and it'll make you happy.<br> Well, that's all I care about-<br> making you happy.<br> Listen. I'm the husband,<br> and it's my job to make you happy.<br> If a husband ain't for that,<br> he ain't for nothin'.<br> Gee, I told the real estate guy<br> I'd meet him tonight.<br> I can't make up my mind<br> about that sign.<br> Eddie Collins" or Edward Collins"?<br> Course, Eddie Collins" is all right<br> for a saloon or somethin' like that.<br> Nope, it ain't got class enough<br> for a radio store.<br> I'll be back in 15 or 20 minutes.<br> And I still think that Edna jane<br> put that idea in your nut.<br> I was afraid you wasn't comin'.<br> What's the idea of phonin' me<br> to meet you here?<br> - Dot and me are movin' here.<br> - You're movin' here?<br> Sure. I got new furniture<br> and everything.<br> That's why I asked you to come.<br> I thought maybe you'd help me<br> put 'em in the right places.<br> You'd be buttin' in anyway, so I figured<br> out you might as well do it in the beginning.<br> You're moving here?<br> Yeah. Dot told me that secret.<br> What's that got to do with your moving<br> and spending your money?<br> She wanted to go to work.<br> - You mean that's the secret she told you?<br> - Yeah.<br> So I put two and two together<br> and figured out why.<br> She wanted a home<br> with nice furnishings and things.<br> - Say, how much did all this cost you?<br> - I shot the bankroll.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Yeah.<br> - All you'd saved?<br> - Sure. This is a swell joint.<br> The furniture man is takin' charge.<br> I bought everything new-<br> from soup to nuts.<br> When it's finished, it'll look just like a home<br> that somebody's lived in for a long time.<br> Some surprise for the kid, huh?<br> Yeah, but what about your store?<br> Well, I figured, why let her<br> starve to death...<br> while I'm tryin'<br> to build up a business?<br> I might've made a flop<br> of the store anyhow.<br> Not that I would've.<br> I'd have made a success of it.<br> Don't get that idea in your nut.<br> And you spent all your savings?<br> Sure. She's worth it.<br> She's a great kid.<br> You'll have me crying<br> in a minute, Eddie.<br> What for?<br> You wouldn't know.<br> Come on. You never saw anything<br> sweller than that parlor set I bought.<br> Come on.<br> Wait till you get a load of the bedroom.<br> It's got sheets and pillowcases<br> and beds and everything in it.<br> And the kitchen-<br> We got a lot of pots and pans.<br> It's gonna be like a party.<br> See, I'm gonna tell Dot that Pat and Sue<br> have got a new flat...<br> and are havin' a housewarming<br> and we're invited.<br> I asked a lot of the gang,<br> and they're in on it too.<br> It's gonna be like, you know,<br> one of those surprise parties.<br> And the big payoff<br> comes when I say...<br> Well, kid, how do you like<br> your new home?"<br> What do you think of the idea?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You didn't think it up. That's why.<br> Hey, wait a minute. Don't put that<br> great big chair over there by the divan.<br> - That's where the chair belongs.<br> - No, it isn't. It belongs over on this side.<br> Haven't you got<br> any sense of balance?<br> - You would get your mouth in it<br> some way or another.<br> dd<br> Hey, hey. Wait until they get here.<br> Aw, have a heart.<br> I haven't had any supper.<br> And don't drink up all the punch.<br> Here they are.<br> Listen, Pat. Remember, this is supposed<br> to be your home. You're the host.<br> - Right. I'll take off my coat and collar.<br> - That ain't funny.<br> - It always gets a laugh.<br> - You open the door. Go on.<br> I didn't even know that Pat<br> had moved from 92nd Street.<br> Sure. They got a swell place here.<br> - Hello, Dot. How are you?<br> - Hello, Sue.<br> - Hello, Eddie.<br> - I didn't know that you'd moved.<br> Oh, I've been here a week.<br> Come in.<br> Hi, everybody.<br> - Hello, Chad.

Oh, yeah. That's right.<br> Say, wait till you get a load<br> of the bedroom. Come on!<br> Say, if Eddie can get Dot a home like this,<br> why can't you get me one?<br> I thought that'd crop up.<br> - Look at this.<br> - Oh, this is swell.<br> Listen, kid.<br> There's a bed.<br> You can't buy a better bed<br> than that- 65 bucks.<br> - But how did you-<br> - Oh, Pat told me.<br> Come on.

When I think of<br> the way my folks used to live.<br> They didn't have enough money<br> to support themselves...<br> so they go and have nine kids.<br> My old lady used to scrub floors<br> in an office building.<br> she went to work-<br> sick or well, summer or winter.<br> I can see her goln'out<br> when It was 20 below zero...<br> wlth a cough that'd tear<br> the heart out of ya.<br> And for what?<br> To brlng up a couple ofklds<br> and dle-<br> dle before they was ever<br> any comfort to her.<br> Not for Dot.<br> Every nlckel I make,<br> she and I are gonna spend on ourselves.<br> - My slster dled brlnglng up-<br> - Oh, stop it!

Your wife, eh?<br> She's afraid.<br> Say, there ain't any danger<br> in these things, is there?<br> Well, lots of women<br> manage to have babies...<br> without calling out the militia.<br> There's no danger when they<br> have the proper attention.<br> She should be made to<br> have confidence in her doctor.<br> That's just it.<br> My wife ain't got any.<br> That's not right.<br> - She speaks of a Dr. Burgess.<br> - Burgess?<br> You'd have to be a millionaire to have him.<br> - Goin' to lunch, Eddie?<br> - Nah, I cut lunches out.
