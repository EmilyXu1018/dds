                        Make the same. It's good for you.<br> Spring air.<br> The way you're gulping it up,<br> there won't be enough left to go around.<br> Isn't it very hot for so early in April,<br> Dr. Gurkakoff?<br> I'm not surprised.<br> This recent bombardment<br> by ions from the sun.<br> You see, temperature is due<br> to the quantity of molecular...<br> Hey, hey. Stop, stop,<br> if you don't want me to retaliate<br> by reciting all the tributary branches<br> of the Amazon.<br> Incredible that only last week we were<br> drawing lots for our hot water bottle.<br> Observe the forsythia or golden bell.<br> I never knew it to bloom so early.<br> Gentlemen. Gentlemen.<br> It's 8:46, gentlemen.<br> Oh, Potts.<br> Just once more around the park.<br> Before we go back to our mausoleum.<br> I saw a scarlet tanager<br> which must have flown<br> all the way from Florida just to enjoy it.<br> - 1,500 miles.<br> - Yes.<br> Our constitutional<br> has taken up too much time already.<br> We're working under pressure.<br> After nine years of effort we are,<br> as the race track enthusiast might say,<br> in the home stretch.<br> Three more years<br> and our encyclopedia will be finished.<br> Let's not bog down<br> in the middle of the letter "S."<br> All right. All right.<br> That's done it.<br> It's now 8:49, gentlemen.<br> I, for one, am going back to work.<br> - Teacher's pet!<br> - Bertram Potts, the incorruptible.<br> The eternal no-no man.<br> Back home. Back home.<br> Oh, well,<br> it may be raining this afternoon, anyway.<br> - Good morning, Miss Bragg.<br> - Good morning, Miss Bragg.<br> - Good morning, Miss Bragg.<br> - Good morning, Professor.<br> - Good morning, Miss Bragg.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Miss Bragg.<br> - Good morning, Professor.<br> Gentlemen, before you get down to work,<br> I have got something to say.<br> One of you made off with<br> a jar of strawberry preserves<br> from my pantry last night.<br> I located the empty jar on the shelf behind<br> The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.<br> That seems to indicate our historian,<br> Professor Peagram.<br> I did no such thing, Miss Bragg.<br> I'm not accusing anybody,<br> but until it's cleared up, I think<br> we'll dispense with jam for breakfast.<br> - Miss Bragg.<br> - Yes, Professor Oddly.<br> I am the one.<br> I was writing about strawberries<br> when suddenly I got a horrible craving.<br> A crime confessed is half atoned.<br> Miss Bragg. Miss Bragg.<br> I had some material here.<br> What happened to it?<br> What happened?<br> I blushed for my duster<br> when I did your desk.<br> You'll find everything<br> in the middle drawer, face down.<br> I'm just starting my article on sex,<br> Miss Bragg. Any objections?<br> No, I trust you have more control<br> of yourself than Professor Oddly.<br> Professor Gurkakoff,<br> your window shade again.<br> Yes, Miss Bragg.<br> It's a crime<br> to carelessly expose this good carpet.<br> You've just committed<br> a more serious crime, Miss Bragg.<br> You have split an infinitive.<br> Never "to carelessly expose."<br> Always "to expose carelessly."<br> I'm not here to juggle words.<br> It's my job<br> to conscientiously see that this house...<br> You've just split another one, Miss Bragg.<br> - Professor...<br> - Oh, oh.<br> - Here's whatchamacallit.<br> - Who?<br> The lawyer for the Foundation.<br> And Miss Totten's with him.<br> And this place looking like a flicker's nest.<br> Yes, we're in for our semi-annual wigging,<br> I suppose.<br> - You'd better put your coat on, Potts.<br> - Why? What...<br> - Better fix your tie.<br> - Fix your hair, fix your hair.<br> Say, what is all this nonsense?<br> This nonsense is Miss Totten.<br> And will you please smile at her?<br> Say, this is all very undignified.<br> - If you think you're being funny, I...<br> - Shh!<br> - Morning, gentlemen.<br> Good morning.<br> Won't you sit here, Miss Totten?<br> It's a very nice morning, Miss Totten.<br> Would you like to speak, Miss Totten,<br> or shall I?<br> You, please, Mr. Larsen.<br> I'll make this as brief as possible,<br> gentlemen.<br> To date, $283,000 have been expended<br> in writing this encyclopedia.<br> You all realize that Miss Totten's father,<br> the late Daniel S. Totten,<br> left only a quarter of a million dollars<br> for this project.<br> Every additional penny will have to come<br> from Miss Totten's own pocket.<br> We would like a frank estimate<br> of how much longer you will take.<br> - Maybe three years, maybe four.<br> - It cannot be. It just cannot be.<br> Oh, my dear Miss Totten,<br> you wouldn't discontinue<br> your father's great gesture<br> towards human enlightenment?<br> "Human enlightenment."<br> What nonsense, Professor Jerome.<br> Papa had just one reason for ever starting<br> this unfortunate enterprise.<br> Vanity.<br> He broke a blood vessel<br> because he found his name was omitted<br> from the Encyclopedia Britannica.<br> Because 30 pages were devoted<br> to Thomas Alva Edison,<br> but not one line to Daniel S. Totten,<br> the inventor of the electric toaster.<br> In our encyclopedia,<br> Mr. Totten shall receive<br> an appropriate amount of space.<br> - Oh, yes, yes.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - Three quarters of a page, I should think.<br> - Three quarters of a page?<br> - That's all he deserves.<br> - Is it?<br> You may go on, Mr. Larsen.<br> All we ask is<br> that you bring this thing to a close<br> somehow or the other.<br> Get on with it. Slap it together.<br> Mr. Larsen, may I have a word?<br> - Hello, Professor Potts.<br> - Hello, Miss Totten.<br> Mr. Larsen, you said, "Slap it together."<br> We're not the slapping together kind.<br> We have started an encyclopedia,<br> and we shall finish it<br> as thoroughly as is humanly possible.<br> - Another $100,000?<br> - If necessary, yes.<br> If our work goes slowly<br> it's because the world, it goes so fast.<br> Take Professor Jerome, our geographer.<br> He has to rewrite all the time.<br> - And Dr. Magenbruch...<br> I'm not interested.<br> Don't interrupt, Mr. Larsen.<br> Go on, Professor.<br> I'm sure it's your wish that this monument<br> to your father be finished<br> as nobly as it was begun.<br> I'm appealing to you, Miss Totten,<br> to your vision and to your heart.<br> Maybe I'm a little inarticulate,<br> but I've always regarded you as a...<br> Yes, Professor?<br> Always regarded you as a...<br> Oh, Professor.<br> - You know what I mean, Miss Totten.<br> - Yes.<br> I warn you, Miss Totten,<br> another four years of this, with...<br> After all, it was Father's wish.<br> But, gentlemen, you will hurry<br> and finish the encyclopedia, won't you?<br> - We will.<br> - Yes, yes, indeed.<br> Last year, when all the other professors<br> came to my musical,<br> where were you, Professor Potts?<br> Sinus. But I shall be there this year.<br> I shall look forward to seeing you again.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, madam.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> That maneuver down my spine<br> was very unnecessary.<br> - Was it, my dear Potts?<br> - Didn't it work?<br> Hi.<br> I hope you don't mind.<br> I came through the kitchen.<br> Who are you?<br> - I'm the garbage man.<br> I want to find out something<br> about Cleopatra.<br> - Cleopatra?<br> - Yeah.<br> This is some kind of a library or school,<br> isn't it?<br> Neither, we are writing an encyclopedia.<br> - Icyclo-what?<br> - An encyclopedia.<br> A work which endeavors to compile<br> and catalog all human knowledge.<br> Say, that's just what I need.<br> Young man,<br> did you come through my kitchen?<br> - That's right, sister.<br> - I'm not your sister, and you get out.<br> - Oh, now...<br> - Miss Bragg.<br> Please, Miss Bragg,<br> we find this intensely interesting.<br> Go on, please.<br> You can't tell me<br> he's not infested with germs.<br> Then go and get your gas mask.<br> Now, shoo, scat, skedaddle.<br> - Please, won't you take a seat?<br> - Thanks, bo.<br> I seen all these books<br> through the window,<br> and I figured<br> that maybe you can help me out.<br> - In what way, young man?<br> - With this quizzola they got on the radio.<br> - This what?<br> - Quizzola?<br> Korn Krunchies Quiz-Quiz.<br> Send in 100 box covers,<br> and you stand to make a little dough.<br> Well, with my opportunities,<br> I got about 3,000 box covers together.<br> Only some of the answers<br> you have to send in to the questions.<br> You know, like true or false.<br> You have those questions here?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Well, that's very interesting.<br> "Question one. Cleopatra died...<br> "A. From swallowing a needle.<br> "B. From snake bite.<br> "C. From hiccups."<br> That's my province. I cover history.<br> The correct answer is "B."<br> Cleopatra, queen of Egypt,<br> daughter of Ptolemy XIII, born 69 BC,<br> killed herself<br> on the 29th day of August, 30 BC,<br> by placing an asp to her bosom.<br> - A what?<br> - An asp.<br> A small snake.<br> Well, patch my pantywaist.<br> Well, well, next.<br> "Which way would you say it?<br> "Two and two is five.<br> "Two and two are five.<br> "Two and two makes five."<br> Professor Potts covers English.<br> - Did you hear the question, Potts?<br> - I did.<br> As the verb<br> is always governed by the subject,<br> the correct answer is,<br> "Two and two are five."<br> - Potts.<br> - Oh, no, Potts.<br> Correct for a grammarian perhaps,<br> but not for a mathematician.<br> Two and two are four.<br> That's a good one.<br> Nobody's gonna get that.<br> Well, I certainly am obliged.<br> I could use a bundle of scratch right now<br> on account of I met me a mouse last week.<br> - Mouse?<br> - What a pair of gams.<br> A little in, a little out,<br> and a little more out...<br> I am still completely mystified.<br> Well, with this dish on me hands<br> and them giving away 25 smackaroos<br> on that quizzola.<br> - Smackaroos?<br> - Smackaroos?

Come on, we'll talk about it<br> in the dressing room.<br> Well, why can't you tell me now?<br> What is all this subpoena business?<br> On account of<br> Benny the Creep had an accident.<br> I never heard of Benny the Creep.<br> Who's he?<br> - One of the boys.<br> - He was on kind of an errand<br> when he grazed into a police car,<br> that dope.<br> And for that I've got to hide out?<br> That don't make sense, Pastrami.<br> No, you see,<br> when the bulls gave Benny a ticket,<br> they saw Kinnick in the back of the car.<br> - Dead.<br> - In the accident?<br> That's what Benny was trying to tell them.<br> - Only they saw Kinnick's feet.<br> - They was in a cake of cement.<br> Benny was gonna dump him<br> in the East River.<br> - That was the errand.<br> - What is all this? Where do I come...<br> Wait a second.<br> Is Joe Lilac mixed up in this?<br> The DA had him picked up<br> about a half hour ago.<br> That's why we're here.<br> That's why you got to beat it.<br> - Joe Lilac mixed up in a murder?<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't believe it, not for a second.<br> He was framed, Sugie, honest he was,<br> may I drop down dead.<br> - Wasn't he, Asthma?<br> - And there was them pajamas they found.<br> - Pajamas?<br> - Yeah, that's where you come in.<br> Remember the dozen pink ones<br> you gave to the boss last Christmas?<br> Before you knew<br> that the only color Joe Lilac wears is lilac?<br> - Yeah.<br> - So we handed them out to the boys.<br> And in the suitcase right beside<br> Benny the Creep when he gets caught<br> is a pair with that big JL monogram.<br> Who is it?<br> I'd like to speak to Miss O'Shea<br> regarding an investigation I'm conducting.<br> Okay, we'll take care of it.<br> Just a minute.<br> - How do you do, Miss O'Shea?<br> - Hello.<br> I hate to intrude like this,<br> but mine is a very...<br> Cut the corners. What is it?<br> Well, this inquiry<br> is one of considerable importance.<br> - Stop beating up with the gums.<br> - What was that?<br> Get this. I don't know from nothing.<br> Oh, but you do.<br> Every word you say proves as much.<br> - Where's that paper?<br> - Subpoena?<br> Suppose you tell the DA<br> to take a nice running jump for himself?<br> Bewildering. And you want to tell me<br> you're not the person I'm looking for?<br> - Say, how many of you are on this job?<br> - The entire project? Eight.<br> Oh. The other seven waiting outside?<br> Oh, no. They're at home.<br> Sound asleep I imagine.<br> - Asleep?<br> - Yes, they go to bed at 9:00 every night.<br> Do you mean to tell me<br> with crime what it is in New York...<br> Say, are you a bull or aren't you?<br> Well, if bull is the slang word<br> for professor, then I'm a bull.<br> - A professor?<br> - Of English.<br> Oh.<br> I thought<br> there was some misunderstanding.<br> Sure was.<br> You see, I'm conducting an investigation<br> on current slang.<br> Would you object<br> if I used you for observation and study?<br> - Yeah, I would.<br> - If I could have your assistance<br> for just a few days it would be...<br> Out, out, Professor.<br> - Then you won't help me?<br> - No. Out. Shove in your clutch.<br> "Shove in your clutch."<br> Exactly the kind of thing I want.<br> Perhaps if I could come back here again<br> when you have more time...<br> Save the gas. I won't be here after tonight.<br> Well, look,<br> here's the address of the Foundation<br> if you should happen<br> to change your mind by any chance.<br> - It's my residence, as well.<br> - Listen, not now.<br> - Well, I'll just leave it here.<br> - Okay, scrow, scram, scraw.<br> The complete conjugation.<br> All right, I'll scraw.<br> Stop futzing around.<br> You haven't got time to get dressed.<br> - All right. Only I...<br> - We'll go out the window.<br> I think you're a pair of cracked dice.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Look out, mister.<br> Good night.<br> - Miss O'Shea.<br> - What do you want?<br> Right there.<br> Open up. District Attorney's office.<br> - Where to?<br> - Just keep cruising, Jack.<br> - Well?<br> - How about that warehouse on West 11th?<br> - No. Too many rats.<br> - Hey, wait a minute.<br> - Where are you taking me?<br> - It's just for the night, Sugarpuss.<br> We can't take you to your place,<br> they'll have it covered.<br> Joe's apartment,<br> they got sealed up like a can of coffee.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Yeah, but you live someplace, don't you?<br> Yeah, sure and the cops know where.<br> Yeah, hotel, I thought of a hotel,<br> but they'll fan every hotel in town.<br> Well, I could change my name.<br> Listen, Sugie, why take chances?<br> It's an awful nice warehouse.<br> He says rats, big mouth does.<br> Well, maybe a few little bitty mice.<br> Uh-uh. That's out.<br> Tomorrow we'll get hold of a lawyer<br> and figure out something with more class.<br> Say, I got an uncle who's an undertaker<br> and with business like it is,<br> he's always got an extra slab.<br> That's fine. That's all I need.<br> Keep thinking.<br> Hey, what's this?<br> "Bertram Potts..."<br> Oh, that's that professor jerk.<br> Uh-oh.<br> I never would have believed it.<br> But how do you account for the name?<br> Have I missed anything?<br> No, I was just about to explain...<br> - You see, the word "puss" means face.<br> - Yes.<br> As for instance, sourpuss, picklepuss.<br> Sugarpuss implies<br> a certain sweetness in her appearance.<br> - Sugar, yes, yes.<br> - Yes.<br> Never mind the etymology.<br> - Was she...<br> - Was she blonde or brunette?<br> - Yes, which?<br> - That, I don't know. I didn't notice.<br> But her vocabulary,<br> even in ordinary conversation...<br> You spoke to her?<br> - Yes, in her dressing room...<br> - In her dressing room?<br> - Backstage?<br> - Yes.<br> Unfortunately,<br> she disclaimed any interest in our project<br> in words so bizarre<br> they made my mouth water.<br> - "Shove in your clutch," for instance.<br> - Why, it's amazing.<br> Potts, could you tell us<br> what was it like backstage?<br> Very vivacious, I imagine.<br> And perhaps, ballerinas giggling<br> up and down iron staircases.<br> Around and around.<br> - Possibly wearing tights.<br> - Tights.<br> And that ineffable smell of rice powder.<br> On nude shoulders.<br> Well.<br> It's getting a bit late, gentlemen.<br> Perhaps we had better get to bed.<br> Someday, I'll tell you my experiences<br> with a young actress<br> named Lillian Russell.<br> Did you know her?<br> I stood in the snow four hours to get to...<br> Is that our doorbell?<br> But it's 12:25.<br> It must be the statistics<br> on San Salvador's saltpeter.<br> I'll get it.<br> I asked for it to be sent registered airmail.<br> Hi-de-ho.<br> Don't tell me I'm too late for class,<br> Professor.<br> Oh, my goodness gracious.<br> Say, what is that?<br> - Those are my colleagues.<br> - Oh.<br> - I apologize for their lack of costume.<br> - Oh, that's all right, Professor.<br> And the fact<br> that I haven't got my tie on and...<br> Oh, you know,<br> once I watched my big brother shave.<br> - Won't you come in?<br> - Why not?<br> Frankly, your coming here<br> was the last thing I expected.<br> Your "no" was so explicit.<br> Well, I got thinking it over<br> and "Foo," I said to myself,<br> "Who am I to give science the brush?"<br> - Then I take it you've reconsidered?<br> - Yeah, that's the big idea.<br> Well.<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear.<br> Look out.<br> - Well, that was Professor Oddly.<br> - Any more of them around?<br> I hope not.<br> Say, who decorated this place?<br> - The mug that shot Lincoln?<br> - This is our work room.<br> The living quarters are upstairs.<br> That's a lot of books. All of them different?<br> - I trust.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - May I have your coat?<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> Miss O'Shea.<br> Greek philosophy,<br> I've got a set like this with a radio inside.<br> Are you sure you don't want your coat?<br> No, I'm fine.<br> Except I've got a run in this stocking.<br> Well, how do we start, Professor?<br> You see, this is the first time<br> anybody moved in on my brain.<br> Have you got some kind of a machine,<br> an X-ray or a vacuum cleaner maybe<br> that sorts out the words you want?<br> What's your method, Professor?<br> Well, it's quite simple. If you will be here<br> tomorrow morning not later than 9:30...<br> Tomorrow morning?<br> Why, yes.<br> I have arranged a round table discussion<br> with a few people of various backgrounds.<br> Uh-huh.<br> You don't think we could sort of<br> begin the Beguine right now?<br> Well, it's nearly 1:00, Miss O'Shea.<br> Oh, foo, Professor,<br> let's get ourselves a couple of drinks,<br> light the fire maybe, and you can start<br> working on me right away.<br> I wouldn't think of imposing upon you<br> at this hour.<br> Listen, I figured on working all night.<br> Well, any hasty random discussion<br> would be of no scientific value.<br> You see, I have to have my notes<br> thoroughly prepared<br> for the seminar tomorrow.<br> Okay. Where do I sleep?<br> I don't know. Where do you live?<br> Up on Riverside.<br> But I'm going to sleep here.<br> Here?<br> You don't understand, Miss O'Shea.<br> We're all bachelors with the exception<br> of Professor Oddly, who is a widower.<br> Why, no woman ever...<br> Even Miss Bragg who takes care<br> of our needs<br> goes home every night at 7:30.<br> If you want me<br> tomorrow morning at 9:30, you...<br> Oh, I do, Miss O'Shea.<br> Even the most free-thinking people<br> must respect the...<br> All right, feel that.<br> Go on. Feel that foot.<br> Okay, tootsie bell, what do you say?<br> - It's cold.<br> - It's cold and it's wet.<br> Now, come here.<br> Come here.<br> Closer.<br> Closer.<br> Come on, give.<br> Hello, kids. Look down my throat.<br> Go on. Look down.<br> All right, right down there, look.<br> I don't know what to look for.<br> There is possibly a slight rosiness<br> in the laryngeal region.<br> Slight rosiness?<br> It's as red as the Daily Worker<br> and just as sore.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm...<br> Who is he?<br> This is Dr. Magenbruch,<br> our physiological expert.<br> This is Professor Robinson, law.<br> - Professor Gurkakoff...<br> - Not so fast. Just let it creep up on me.<br> I'll get to know them.<br> Come here, physiology.<br> For all I know, I've got a fever. Feel.<br> - It's possible.<br> - Certainly.<br> And he wants to throw me out on my tin.<br> There'll be no 9:30 for me<br> if you let me go out in the rain now.<br> Naturally not.<br> With the streets cold<br> and the subway hot and full of germs.<br> I'm a push-over for streptococcus.<br> - Can I have this now, kid?<br> - Pardon me.<br> We'll call you a heated taxi and furnish you<br> with woolen socks and warm slippers.<br> - How do you like that?<br> - Really, I don't understand you, Potts.<br> - Why take chances?<br> - With valuable material?<br> - You must think of your article, Potts.<br> - See, they get the point.<br> If I might venture a suggestion,<br> why couldn't the young lady<br> sleep in my room?<br> - What?<br> - What?<br> - Well!<br> - Professor Peagram!<br> I can bunk in with Professor Robinson.<br> I sometimes do<br> when there's an electric storm.<br> Yes, he's afraid of thunder.<br> Well, then it's all settled.<br> Well, I guess I'll turn in.<br> Can I have my coat?<br> - Of course.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Hi-de-ho, fellows.<br> - Hi-de-ho.<br> - I'll show you to my room.<br> - Yes, we all will go.<br> I know where my own room is, thank you,<br> - without any help from you.<br> - Why shouldn't... Why shouldn't...<br> I'll find it. Don't bother.<br> Just rough out the directions.<br> Top of the stairs<br> and the third door on the left.<br> Gentlemen, just a moment, please.<br> Gentlemen, this is all highly irregular.<br> What if this should come<br> to the attention of the Foundation?<br> And what about Miss Bragg tomorrow?<br> What are you talking about?<br> This is research, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Certainly.<br> Who was that guy learned so much<br> from watching an apple drop?<br> Isaac Newton, 1642 to 1727.<br> - The law of gravity.<br> - Yeah, that's him.<br> And I want you to look at me<br> as another apple, Professor Potts.<br> Just another apple.<br> It fits you like a glove,<br> you admit that, don't you?<br> I like a little more effect around<br> the shoulders, sort of a puffed sleeve.<br> - You know that JL could be Joe Lilac.<br> - Could be.<br> - Still claim it isn't yours?<br> - No, it isn't and never was.<br> Come on, loosen up, Joe.<br> It's 5:00 in the morning.<br> How's about a little Benzedrine?<br> - Put it on Benny the Creep.<br> - Sure.<br> Take off your coat.<br> I should have brought along my valet.<br> I'm a sucker for comfort.<br> Why, don't worry, Joe.<br> You'll have your comfort.<br> We'll have platinum bars on your cell,<br> and we'll heat up a chair for you, special.<br> Twenty thousand volts.<br> AC or DC?<br> - So those are your pajamas, huh?<br> - Yep.<br> You always wear them<br> three sizes too big?<br> Allows for my chest expansion.<br> And my fingers get kind of chilly at night.<br> And the JL?<br> It stands for jellybean.<br> It stands for lollipop.<br> - Take him away.<br> - Come on.<br> That's fine. That's great.<br> You never heard of Benny the Creep.<br> Benny the Creep never heard of you.<br> There was no murder.<br> And there is no murder ring<br> with you at the control boards<br> pushing the buttons.<br> - Good morning, Joe.<br> - Hiya, McNeary?<br> Morning, and pardon my glove,<br> Mr. District Attorney.<br> Good morning.<br> - All right, I've got a writ of habeas corpus.<br> - I've forgotten my reading glasses.<br> Too bad. Come on, Joe.<br> May be a couple of days<br> before I find them.<br> - I won't stand for my client's...<br> - It's all right, McNeary.<br> The man's trying to clean up the city.<br> Why not give him<br> all the cooperation we can?<br> - Does that mean you're going to talk, Joe?<br> - What about?<br> Well, I'll make the pajamas talk.<br> Here's the sales slip for them.<br> They were bought by Miss O'Shea.<br> She bought them for you.<br> Or maybe you never heard of her.<br> Maybe she isn't your girlfriend.<br> - Why bring a lady's name into this?<br> - I'll bring the lady in herself.<br> Where do we stand with that O'Shea girl?<br> What?<br> What about the deputies?<br> All right, let me talk to Collins himself.<br> - What about the girl?<br> - Don't worry.<br> We've got her in safe deposit temporarily.<br> - Temporarily is not good enough.<br> - I've got something figured out.<br> - Nothing gloomy, I hope.<br> - Strictly legal.<br> A wife can't testify against her husband.<br> - She's not my wife.<br> - Not yet, she isn't.<br> But once they let you go,<br> we'll pull a fastie.<br> Of all the incompetent...<br> What sweetheart dreamed up that law?<br> Don't give me that. You've had six hours.<br> Tell those guys to get a jump on.<br> Having some trouble, Mr. DA?<br> Don't worry, Joe.<br> And don't underestimate this office<br> or the State of New York.<br> I've got some boys<br> that can find a needle in a haystack.<br> Why, that's a cinch.<br> All you have to do is get a horse<br> to eat the hay and then X-ray the horse.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Hold your horses.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> What time is it?<br> This is worse than being in the army.<br> Professor Potts started<br> the round table discussion 10 minutes ago.<br> He did? Say, that's divastigating.<br> - And this came for you.<br> - Who brought it?<br> - A couple of persons.<br> - Any message?<br> - Well, they spoke very picturesquely.<br> - Yeah, very.<br> Yes, they said it's getting hot and hotter<br> and to stay in the icebox<br> like a good little salad.<br> And this is the dressing.<br> - The salad, huh?<br> - And we wondered what it meant.<br> Yes, we did.<br> I'll tell you, sweetie. I...<br> Gentlemen. Gentlemen.<br> - Miss Bragg.<br> - Oh, my goodness.<br> Sounds like Mother calling.<br> Kids, you better go.<br> See you later.<br> - Gentlemen, where are you, gentlemen?<br> - We're coming, Miss Bragg, we're coming.<br> - On our way.<br> - I would like to talk to you.<br> I wanted to ask you,<br> what were all your trousers<br> doing in my kitchen?<br> - I wanted mine pressed.<br> - Well, that accounts for one pair.<br> - I did, too.<br> - Mine, too.<br> Seven pairs, all at once?<br> What's going on in this house anyway?<br> No constitutional this morning.<br> You've hardly touched your breakfast.<br> Professor Potts in the dining room with<br> a conglomeration of dubious characters.<br> You, not at your desks.<br> - That's right, gentlemen, we have to work.<br> - Yes, we have to work.<br> - What were you doing upstairs, anyway?<br> - We took up a suitcase.<br> - Suitcase?<br> - Yes.<br> - Whose suitcase?<br> - We're very busy, Miss Bragg.<br> I said, whose suitcase?<br> Well, now, Miss Bragg, there is...<br> - There is someone staying with us.<br> - Staying with us?<br> - That's it.<br> - Who?<br> Who's staying with us?<br> What's the matter? Cat got your tongues?<br> - Who's staying with us?<br> - Well, I...<br> - Well, I... Oh, dear.<br> - Professor Potts didn't tell you?<br> - No, and I want to know.<br> - Well, under the pressure<br> - of a very trying assignment...<br> - Yes?<br> - He's...<br> - Go on.<br> - He's taken a temporary assistant.<br> - Yes.<br> - So we're running a hotel now.<br> - Not exactly.<br> It seems to me that... Professor Robinson,<br> - is that one of your socks?<br> - No, not mine.<br> I wish that it...<br> Well, I know Professor Peagram<br> explains the corset he wears<br> as due to a floating kidney.<br> What's the explanation of this?<br> Say, kids, I'm stuck.<br> Any of you can jerk a zipper?<br> A zipper?<br> Yeah, the darn thing's stuck...<br> Hello, who are you?<br> - This is our Miss Bragg.<br> - Miss... Did you say Bag?<br> Bragg. How do you do?<br> Great-o.<br> Do you know anything about zippers?<br> - Do you? Do you?<br> - Well, I...<br> - Well, do you?<br> - Do I?<br> - No, I don't, but Professor Gurkakoff.<br> - Okay.<br> - Well, it's purely mechanical.<br> - But look, you were married.<br> No, I'm just a botanist.<br> Look, kids, after all,<br> you know, this is only a zipper.<br> - Come on, Gurky.<br> - Well, I can try.<br> You know, I had this happen one night<br> in the middle of my act.<br> I couldn't get a thing off,<br> was I embarrassed.<br> How's chances for a cup of coffee?<br> - No breakfast after 9:00.<br> - You see, it's a rule.<br> Just like my Aunt Beulah that<br> brought me up, that's why I left home.<br> - There.<br> - Oh, swell.<br> Now where is this little clambake<br> of Professor Potts'?<br> - In the dining room, just across the hall.<br> - In the dining room. See you later, kids.<br> Don't tell me the jive session<br> has beat off without baby.<br> Shut the door please, Miss O'Shea.<br> You're late.<br> I won't waste time with introductions.<br> These are our collaborators.<br> - Hi, kids.<br> - Hi.<br> As I was saying, I've worked out<br> a series of cross-references<br> which I believe will be the best approach<br> to our subject.<br> Going like gangbusters, isn't he?<br> Sit down, please.<br> I don't think<br> you'll find our venture dull, Miss O'Shea.<br> The scientific conquest of<br> an important subject is never dull.<br> "Slang," as the poet<br> Carl Sandburg has said,<br> "is language which takes off its coat,<br> "spits on its hands and goes to work."<br> Let us... Let us, too,<br> then get down to work.<br> Well, we've accomplished a lot<br> in the last three days,<br> and I'm very grateful to all of you.<br> There's another word<br> I'd like to take up now.<br> It's recurred several times<br> in our discussions,<br> and its meaning still eludes me.<br> I think it was Miss O'Shea<br> who used it yesterday<br> in reference to the cuffs that I wear.<br> - The word is "corny."<br> - Yeah, wouldn't you say they were corny?<br> - Because of the cornstarch in them?<br> - Because it's 1941.<br> - Then corny means old-fashioned.<br> - Kind of hick, loose-tooth.<br> Mortimer Snerd.<br> Oh, gee.<br> There's other kinds of corn, too.<br> When you give your girl<br> your fraternity pin,<br> well, if she says, "I'll keep it forever,"<br> - that's corny, too.<br> - Yeah, or take a joke.<br> "That's no lady, that's my wife."<br> Making your baby's shoes into ashtrays.<br> - That's corn.<br> - Right off the cob.<br> Well, let's stick to corn.<br> Is it synonymous with baloney?<br> No, it's anything<br> that gets them in the sticks.<br> "Long time, no see," that's Indian corn.<br> Yeah, when a guy comes to see a girl<br> and says,<br> "Let's turn off the lights,<br> it hurts my eyes."<br> Brother, that's corn.<br> The implication is<br> he's trying to pull some hoytoytoy.<br> - You're catching on, Professor.<br> - Countrified, old-fashioned, sentimental.<br> Business kind of peaked, Jack?<br> Yeah, it takes up a lot of time<br> being on the faculty.<br> - I'll buy the heap.<br> - There's no call for you to do that.<br> Why not?<br> I want to line my bureau drawers.<br> Gee, thanks.<br> - Back in a second, Professor.<br> - Oh, yes, all right.<br> - Miss O'Shea.<br> - Just a minute.<br> - Miss O'Shea.<br> - Yeah?<br> We saw you pass the library arch,<br> and we kind of got a little problem<br> on our hands.<br> - Would you help us?<br> - Why, I'd love to.<br> Oh, good.<br> You're kind of spruced up today,<br> aren't you, Professor?<br> - The spats?<br> - Yeah.<br> I ran across them in my bottom drawer.<br> Why let the moths eat them?<br> Attaboy. What's your problem, sweetie?<br> - Well, look.<br> - Let me start again.<br> But, Professor,<br> I'm completely exhausted.<br> But we've got to get it right.<br> Now, start with the right foot.<br> - The left foot.<br> - The right foot.<br> Gentlemen, it's the left foot.<br> - Which foot, please?<br> - The right foot.<br> All right, but you're wrong.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> One, two, three.<br> But I can't "humph" from here.<br> We've been working on it<br> ever since luncheon.<br> Holy smoke.<br> - Start again with the left foot, come on.<br> - The left foot.<br> One, two, three.<br> Well, it's the right motion.<br> - But it doesn't feel right.<br> - It doesn't look right.<br> Possibly it isn't right.<br> There was two "humphs." Humph, humph.<br> Well, that would make it right.<br> Humph, humph.<br> You're wrong, my dear Gurkakoff.<br> Mathematics can never be wrong.<br> Look here, I'll show you.<br> - Stay there, Professor Oddly.<br> - Show him.<br> One, two.<br> Professor Oddly, please stand up.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> - One, two, three. Humph, humph.<br> - Just one.<br> - The expert is here. We need you.<br> - What's the trouble?<br> Well, that dance you showed us last night.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yes, maybe we're not very bright.<br> Professor Gurkakoff has been trying<br> to reconstruct it by compound fractions.<br> - You'd better relax, lover.<br> - Who, me? Thank you.<br> I can't find the common denominator<br> between the steps and the music.<br> You bet you can't, you're playing<br> a polka, and I taught you a conga.<br> How about some light in here? Come on.<br> Look, kids, this is the tempo.<br> Got it?<br> - That's right, hit it.<br> - Hit what?<br> That's what I told you.<br> - One, two, three...<br> - Attaboy, Gurky! You're wonderful!<br> Wing it, Professor. Hang on.<br> Good afternoon.<br> How do you like the new suit?<br> What the well-dressed professor will wear.<br> A young lady chased me all the way up<br> Fifth Avenue.<br> Probably to tell you<br> to take the price tag off.<br> Did you... Did you get the records?<br> Well, they were all out of<br> Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar.<br> - Oh, dear, oh, dear.<br> - But I got Chicka Chicka Boom Boom<br> - and Shoot the Sherbet to Me Herbert.<br> - Now watch us go.<br> Thank you very much, gentlemen.<br> The same time tomorrow,<br> all of you who can.<br> - Okay, coach, so long.<br> - Goodbye.<br> This has given me<br> a new interest in life, Doc.<br> Me, too.<br> I'm gonna use some of those<br> two-dollar words hollering my papers.<br> Park Avenue bigamy scandal,<br> most illuminating, most illuminating!<br> - So long, Prof.<br> - And thank you very much.<br> That's all right.<br> Excuse me for talking shop,<br> but your garbage certainly<br> has cheered up these days.<br> Flowers, candy boxes, perfume wrappings<br> and an empty of that sweet French liqueur.<br> Why, that's not our garbage,<br> I'm sure.<br> Maybe it wasn't, but it was in your pail.<br> I'm leaving, sister.<br> Miss Bragg.<br> May I have a word with you,<br> Professor Potts?<br> That music, is it coming from next door?<br> From this door, and that's what<br> I want to talk to you about.<br> Either she goes or I go.<br> - You're speaking of Miss O'Shea?<br> - I am, Professor Potts.<br> That is the kind of woman<br> that makes whole civilizations topple.<br> It's always been my pride to scrupulously,<br> untiringly, efficiently...<br> Now, now, Miss Bragg,<br> you've split that infinitive three times.<br> I repeat, either she goes or I go.<br> I don't like ultimata, Miss Bragg,<br> but I shall look into the matter.<br> Don't look into the matter,<br> look into the library.<br> Hiya, Pottsy, come on, hook on!<br> I feel so abandoned.<br> Hey, what's the big idea?<br> As soon as you gentlemen get your breath,<br> we had better have a conference.<br> Will you please leave the room,<br> Miss O'Shea?<br> - But we've only just started.<br> - If you please, Miss O'Shea.<br> Loose-tooth again.<br> Now, if you gentlemen will be kind enough<br> to get together all that you've written<br> in the last three days...<br> Well, it's about time.<br> I thought you two had amnesia<br> and forgot where you parked me.<br> Hold the phone, Sugie.<br> Dropping me on the doorstep<br> like a throwaway for a credit dentist.<br> - You said it was for one night.<br> - Sugie, for snap's sake.<br> You're as hot as a pistol.<br> The DA's got 100 men on the job.<br> Why, they're squeezing this town<br> through a sieve, borough by borough.<br> You tell her, Pastrami.<br> They're tailing us, Sugie. Took us<br> three hours to get here from 48th Street.<br> Detoured through Jamaica, Long Island<br> to shake them off.<br> Okay, you wait here.<br> I'll get my things together<br> in two seconds flat.<br> Hey, wait a minute, Sugie.<br> - We got a surprise for you.<br> - You ain't leaving, not right yet.<br> I'm not? Joe's out, isn't he?<br> Yeah, but for how long? They're laying<br> for you so they can get him back.<br> That's the surprise.<br> I'm supposed to stay in this old mans'<br> home till the moths eat holes in me?<br> Say, when I say a surprise,<br> I mean a surprise.<br> Go on, flash it to her.<br> Put on your sunglasses, Sugie.<br> - Oh, boy.<br> - Seven grand boiled into that one, Sugie.<br> Joe doesn't have to bribe me<br> just because I do him a little favor.<br> It's not a bribe, don't take it like that.<br> Let him try and get it back though.<br> Say, it's not your size, is it?<br> It'll do, if I have to whittle down my finger.<br> Third finger, left hand, Sugie.<br> - Who do you think you're kidding?<br> - The future Mrs. Joe Lilac.<br> - Come again?<br> - Wedding bells, sweetheart.<br> Joe and the lawyer have got it<br> all figured out.<br> Yeah, a wife can't testify<br> against husband, see.<br> Don't put it like that, you dope.<br> Say, he's been thataway about you<br> ever since he first picked you out.<br> Yeah, but it took the DA<br> to make him pop the question.<br> He sent you a love message.<br> He says to tell you he gets more bang<br> out of you than any dame he ever knew.<br> And he's the top, Sugie,<br> do you realize that? He's the top.<br> Mrs. Joe Lilac.<br> Third Avenue girl<br> in the major league at last.<br> Wait till they find out,<br> those other dolls in the show.<br> Watch me break their crockery with this.<br> Here, here,<br> the wedding's got to be a fast one, though.<br> Over in New Jersey someplace.<br> Now, this is the application for the license,<br> and you sign right here.<br> - Will I? You got a pen?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Unscrew it for Mrs. Lilac.<br> - Right here, right here.<br> You know, I can't make up my mind.<br> Will I continue my night club career<br> or bust in on the Helen Hayes racket?<br> Say, this ought to be signed<br> before a notary public.<br> I'm a notary public,<br> permission expires 1943.<br> Were those pajamas a good investment.<br> You'll get the final dope<br> by tomorrow morning.<br> Joe will phone around 10:00.<br> Now, meantime lie low<br> and stick close to the Ameche.<br> - Okay, the what?<br> - The telephone.<br> - Miss Sugarpuss.<br> - You'd better duck.<br> - Okay, 10:00, I'll be waiting.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> - Miss Sugarpuss.<br> - Here I am.<br> Just getting a little air.<br> - Miss O'Shea.<br> - What's buzzing, cousin?<br> Professor Potts would...<br> He wishes to speak to you.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> Don't worry, kids, cheer up.<br> - Shut the door, please.<br> - Sure.<br> - Take this chair, please, Miss O'Shea.<br> - This particular one?<br> Okay.<br> Open your mouth, please.<br> Open your mouth. Wider.<br> Thank you.<br> - Can I close it now?<br> - Please do.<br> - Okay.<br> - Miss O'Shea.<br> Yeah?<br> Circumstances, under, over which<br> neither of us has the least control,<br> force me to a step<br> I am most reluctant to take.<br> The sky is perfectly clear.<br> The thermometer stands at 76.<br> Your throat seems quite normal.<br> I must ask you to leave.<br> Leave here? Why?<br> Miss O'Shea,<br> I want you to look at our project,<br> I mean the encyclopedia, as a voyage,<br> a long, hard, tedious one.<br> A voyage from "A" to "Z."<br> Now, when the Foundation<br> launched our vessel,<br> it very wisely followed an old rule<br> of the sea, no women aboard.<br> It chose a crew of single men<br> with nothing to distract them<br> from the course they were to sail.<br> Say, junior, couldn't stop<br> walking around a little, could you?<br> For four days, we have been drifting,<br> Miss O'Shea.<br> The needle of the compass<br> no longer points to the magnetic pole.<br> It points, if I may say so, to your ankles.<br> Come now, Admiral,<br> a bunch of grown men,<br> they've seen a pair of ankles before.<br> Not for nine years.<br> Except for the singularly uninspiring<br> underpinnings of Miss Bragg.<br> Now, my colleagues...<br> If you think I'm bothering them,<br> I'll sit on my legs.<br> - And I'll do it in my room or in the kitchen.<br> - Too late.<br> - You must leave, Miss O'Shea.<br> - Well, I can't leave now.<br> How about that slang?<br> It's not finished yet.<br> There's a lot of words<br> we haven't caught up with.<br> For instance, do you know what this<br> means, "I'll get you on the Ameche"?<br> - No.<br> - Of course, you don't.<br> An Ameche is the telephone.<br> - On account of he invented it.<br> - Oh, no, he didn't.<br> - You know, in the movies.<br> - I see what you mean. Very interesting.<br> Make no mistake, I shall regret<br> the absence of your keen mind.<br> Unfortunately, it is inseparable<br> from an extremely disturbing body.<br> All right. I'll go, only don't shove.<br> - I'll leave sometime tomorrow.<br> - Not tomorrow. Right away.<br> - But I tell you I've got a...<br> - I insist, Miss O'Shea.<br> Oh, Crabapple Annie.<br> - Listen, Pottsy...<br> - Crabapple Annie?<br> Why, that implies<br> that I'm puritanical and narrow-minded.<br> Yeah.<br> I am a perfectly normal man<br> with perfectly normal instincts.<br> - But an awful high boiling point.<br> - Not even that.<br> I, too, have been acutely aware<br> of your presence.<br> - You have?<br> - Twice, to be exact.<br> Once when you leaned over my shoulder<br> to correct my spelling of<br> the word "boogie-woogie,"<br> I could feel your breath on my ear.<br> And yesterday afternoon when you<br> happened to stand against the window<br> with the sunlight in your hair.<br> - What'd you do about it?<br> - I left the room,<br> dipped my handkerchief in cold water<br> and applied it to the back of<br> my neck right there,<br> - where the nerve center is.<br> - That's cute.<br> You see, that's the basic difference<br> between me and the other professors.<br> We are all beguiled,<br> but I am relatively young.<br> I can suppress temptation.<br> I generate enough energy<br> to take precautionary measures.<br> A little sun on my hair<br> and you had to water your neck.<br> Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it,<br> Miss O'Shea,<br> but I'm merely trying to point out the fact<br> that the success of our enterprise<br> is at stake.<br> I want you to...<br> Cooperate.<br> I want you to leave.<br> All right, I'll go.<br> But if I'm going to go anyway,<br> I guess I might as well spill it.<br> Spill it? Spill what?<br> Why do you suppose<br> I came here in the first place?<br> To help with the research.<br> - I did not. I came on account of you.<br> - Me?<br> And not on account of<br> you needed some slang.<br> On account of<br> because I wanted to see you again.<br> Miss O'Shea, the construction<br> "on account of because"<br> outrages every grammatical law.<br> So what? I came on account of<br> because I couldn't stop thinking about you<br> after you left my dressing room.<br> On account of because I thought<br> you were big and cute and pretty.<br> - Pretty?<br> - Yeah, I mean you.<br> Maybe I'm just crazy, but to me,<br> you're a regular yum-yum type.<br> - Yum-yum?<br> - Yeah, don't you know what that means?<br> No, we never got to that.<br> Well, we've got to it now,<br> and I'm glad it's out.<br> I don't give a whoop<br> whether the others went for me.<br> You're the one I'm wacky about,<br> just plain wacky.<br> - Can you understand that?<br> - Please, Miss O'Shea.<br> Oh, please, nothing.<br> Maybe you can generate or whatever it is<br> for all that suppress business, but...<br> I can't. No, you're too tall.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - You'll find out.<br> Those are Professor Gurkakoff's<br> reference books.<br> - Now, isn't that just too bad!<br> - And they're very...<br> - That's perfect.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> Come here,<br> I'm going to show you what yum-yum is.<br> Here's yum.<br> Here's the other yum.<br> And here's yum-yum.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hey, where are you going?<br> Did you see?<br> He practically stepped on my hand.<br> - Three steps at a time.<br> - Shot out of a gun.<br> - But where is he going?<br> - Why?<br> To get a razor strop, I hope,<br> and I hope he knows where to apply it.<br> - Well, Professor Potts?<br> - Yes, Miss Bragg.<br> Will one of you call a taxi<br> from the corner for Miss O'Shea?<br> - Right away.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Fine business.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> What's the idea of<br> running out on me like that?<br> Nothing, nothing.<br> The last few minutes<br> only confirmed my former decision.<br> Your further presence here would be fatal.<br> You must get me out of your mind<br> just as I must get you out of this house.<br> - Your hair's wet.<br> - Well, never mind, please.<br> - Well, it is wet.<br> - Well, what of it?<br> Nothing, I just happened to mention it.<br> - Well, forget it, please.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> Now to get back to the subject<br> under discussion.<br> It would be idle of me to deny that I, too,<br> feel the affinity<br> that you mentioned a few minutes ago,<br> very strongly.<br> After three years,<br> when my work is finished,<br> perhaps we can take up where we left off.<br> In the meantime, I hope we can keep up<br> some sort of correspondence.<br> - Would you, Miss Sugarpuss?<br> - Oh, Pottsy.<br> I know that's the way I feel, too,<br> but it has to be.<br> Sugarpuss, before you go, would you...<br> Would you<br> yum me just once more?<br> - It seems so unnecessary.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> - The taxi's here.<br> I'll tell him.<br> Professor Potts,<br> the taxi for that young woman is here.<br> The taxi.<br> - Yes, what is it?<br> - The taxi's here.<br> Taxi? What taxi?<br> Miss O'Shea's or mine.<br> It's all yours, Crabapple Annie.<br> What is the delay, young man?<br> Delivery was promised for 10:00.<br> Sign here.<br> - I trust that it's engraved correctly.<br> - I guess so.<br> - $39.85, wasn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Here's $40. Keep the change.<br> - You're sure the setting is solid gold?<br> - Why, of course.<br> There was one $5 cheaper,<br> but not nearly so handsome.<br> - Let's see it, Potts.<br> - Yes, please.<br> No, no, it's wrapped so neatly, I hate to.<br> - I'll take it, Miss Bragg.<br> - Room service.<br> - Now we've got room service.<br> - I thought she might like this.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's nothing, really.<br> Be careful.<br> If I were the cream<br> for that woman's coffee, I'd curdle.<br> I thought you meant to leave us<br> in protest, Miss Bragg.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> A nurse does not quit her post<br> when an epidemic reaches a crisis.<br> Come in.<br> - Morning, Pottsy.<br> - Good morning. I brought your breakfast.<br> Good, I'll have it right here<br> in the snooze stand, thank you.<br> - How do you take it?<br> - Just jav, no cow.<br> - Just what?<br> - Black.<br> - Sugar?<br> - Straight.<br> - Toast?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - You sure you don't want some toast?<br> - Uh-uh.<br> Well, here's some jam to go with it.<br> It's blackberry.<br> - Never use it.<br> - Not just one bite?<br> Mmm-mmm.<br> Sit down and take a load off your feet.<br> Say, I found out what's wrong with<br> "on account of because."<br> It's saying the same thing twice,<br> you know, like calling somebody<br> a rich millionaire.<br> You call it a pleo...<br> No, wait a minute, a plea...<br> - A pleonasm?<br> - Yes, that how you pronounce it? That's it.<br> - Who told you that?<br> - This room's full of books about grammar.<br> I read for a couple of hours.<br> I couldn't sleep, either.<br> I walked in the park till the sun<br> came up over the East Sixties.<br> It took me all that time<br> to gather my thoughts,<br> to analyze my impulses<br> and clarify our relationship.<br> Have we got one of those?<br> It's a very important moment,<br> a new chapter.<br> In fact, for me, it's the first chapter.<br> For what has my life been up till now?<br> A preface. An empty foreword.<br> You couldn't talk a little plainer,<br> could you?<br> Not if you won't have a piece of toast.<br> At least just... At least look under the lid.<br> - You went and bought me a present.<br> - I hope it fits.<br> Gurkakoff calculated the circumference<br> of your finger.<br> I woke up the jeweler at 7:00 this morning.<br> - It's a lovely ring, Pottsy, really it is.<br> - I hoped you'd like it.<br> It's our... It's our engagement ring.<br> - Pottsy, do you mean you...<br> - Yes, I did, I...<br> You mean you really...<br> Well?<br> - What am I supposed to say?<br> - Just say yes.<br> After you've declared your feelings,<br> it's the only logical step to take.<br> Don't you think you'd better take<br> another turn around the park, Pottsy?<br> I'm just as surprised as you.<br> Marriage? I thought<br> I was married to my books.<br> The only thing<br> I thought I could care for deeply<br> was a correctly constructed sentence.<br> The subject, predicate, adverbial clause,<br> each in its proper place, and then you...<br> You see, I've had rather a curious life.<br> I graduated from Princeton when I was 13.<br> I recited Tyger, Tyger Burning Bright<br> when I was a year old.<br> Before I was two, I could read fluently.<br> People like that just, well...<br> You see, dust just piles up on their hearts.<br> And it took you to blow it away.<br> Yeah, but I...<br> I didn't mean<br> to blow it smack into your eyes.<br> Well, that's what happened, look.<br> Look inside the ring.<br> Oh, yeah, there's writing.<br> - "Richard III." Who's Richard III?<br> - Richard III.<br> Act 1, Scene 2, line 204.<br> - There wasn't room for all the words.<br> - What words?<br> Well, they go like this, quote,<br> "Look, how this ring<br> encompasseth thy finger.<br> "Even so thy breast<br> encloseth my poor heart.<br> "Wear both of them,<br> for both of them are thine."<br> Unquote, I suppose.<br> I hope you don't think it's too corny.<br> - Pottsy, I...<br> - Come in.<br> - There is a telephone call for you.<br> - For me?<br> We didn't want to interrupt, but the man<br> on the wire said it was from your daddy.<br> - Daddy?<br> - That's what he said.<br> Oh.<br> - Oh, yes, Daddy!<br> - It's long distance.<br> Yeah, I'll get it.<br> - How did it go, Potts?<br> - She seemed quite overwhelmed.<br> That was to be expected.<br> You see, excuse me,<br> you see, the customary procedure<br> is to approach<br> the parents of the young lady first.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes, I realize that.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello, hello, it's Asthma, Sugie.<br> The boss wants to talk to you,<br> only we're relaying the call<br> so it won't be traced, dig me?<br> Here she is, boss. Ready?<br> Okay, Sugie, don't use no names, though.<br> Oh, boy, did you call at the right minute.<br> Where are you?<br> Some whistle snort in New Jersey.<br> Rancocas, it's called.<br> Well, how you been, Sugie? I hear<br> you're hiding out with the seven dwarfs.<br> Eight. And it's kind of indicated<br> I'd better get out of here quick.<br> Oh, no, nothing like that, it's just that one<br> of the professors got off the beam a little.<br> Yeah, a slight case of Andy Hardy.<br> Why don't you just take his umbrella<br> and whack him over the knuckles?<br> Well, everything's all set, babe.<br> The license comes through this afternoon.<br> I got a justice of the peace all lined up.<br> Yeah, that's what we're trying<br> to figure out, how to get you here.<br> No, I don't want you to take a train.<br> They'd spot you like a lead dime.<br> They'll be watching everything,<br> Holland Tunnel, Washington Bridge.<br> I don't even trust the highways.<br> I don't care<br> if I have to hook a ride on a hearse.<br> I want to get out of here.<br> I don't like it. I want to blow.<br> Well, what other news is there, Daddy?<br> Everything fine at home? Is Mom all right?<br> For Easter? Well, I don't know, Daddy.<br> Just a minute.<br> I won't be long, just wait in the library.<br> Do you mind if I have a few words<br> with your father?<br> Sure.<br> Daddy, this is the professor<br> I was telling you about.<br> Mr. O'Shea? My name is Bertram Potts.<br> I judge your daughter has already<br> told you of my aspirations in her regard.<br> Hey, are you crazy?<br> You're quite right, Mr. O'Shea.<br> It's inexcusable for one<br> to introduce oneself<br> to one's future father-in-law<br> over the telephone.<br> But before even considering<br> entrusting your daughter's<br> future happiness to my care,<br> I'm sure you want to know all about me.<br> Well, as character references,<br> you might get in touch with the head<br> of the Rockefeller Foundation,<br> and the President of Princeton,<br> my own university.<br> Well, except for occasional trouble<br> with my left sinus,<br> I am in excellent physical condition.<br> - How's your digestion, son?<br> - Good.<br> I draw a salary of $3,200 per year.<br> In the last election,<br> I voted the straight Republican ticket.<br> That's fine, that's fine.<br> I just had a brain flash, McNeary.<br> What did you say your first name is, son?<br> Bertram.<br> Well, Bertram,<br> I don't know if Sugarpuss told you,<br> but she's our only child.<br> We kind of never figured<br> on having a professor in the family,<br> but if that's what she wants,<br> then that's fine with us.<br> Well, I shall do everything I can,<br> Mr. O'Shea, to make her happy.<br> Just one thing more, Bertram.<br> Mom is kind of an invalid,<br> doesn't do any traveling.<br> But it would just break her heart<br> not to see Sugarpuss married.<br> - You understand that?<br> - Of course, sir.<br> My mother's dead,<br> but I know it would have...<br> It would have made her happy<br> to be present.<br> So, suppose you just bring the kid<br> right down here.<br> We want to see you and<br> let's have the ceremony in our hometown.<br> Why, of course, Mr. O'Shea.<br> May I call you Father, Mr. O'Shea?<br> Thank you, Father.<br> It was better than I hoped for.<br> Your father wants to talk to you.<br> Well, Sugie,<br> this solves your transportation.<br> That Jack was made-to-order.<br> Who's gonna stop the Rockefeller<br> Foundation and Princeton University?<br> And suppose you get a couple of the other<br> old beavers to come along in the car.<br> Maybe there's some other way.<br> I don't want to take them<br> for that kind of a ride.<br> That's quite all right.<br> I'll take a couple of days off.<br> - Yes, we all will.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> Now cut out the menkenkes, Sugie.<br> This gets you to Rancocas.<br> Once you're here, we'll give the professor<br> the boot, easy like,<br> where it won't blind him.<br> I don't want any discussions.<br> Just one thing.<br> Watch out for the Washington Bridge.<br> That'll be swarming with cops.<br> Hello? Hello?<br> - What's the matter, my dear?<br> - He's always in such a rush.<br> Which is my great good fortune,<br> the sooner the better.<br> Gentlemen, I now have the honor<br> to announce our betrothal.<br> Congratulations.<br> Very sensibly condensed,<br> as in the Reader's Digest.<br> - Please don't cry, I'm very happy.<br> - Can't help it.<br> Look, why don't you go upstairs and<br> pack my fiance's things for her? Please.<br> - I want to be an usher.<br> - We'll all be ushers.<br> One kisses the bride. May I?<br> - We'll all kiss the bride.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> - May we?<br> - Go ahead.<br> We are very happy.<br> We feel that you are marrying<br> all of us, a little.<br> Yes, yes, indeed.<br> We wish you every happiness, my dear.<br> All of us.<br> If we're gonna get started<br> this afternoon, I'd better be going.<br> Well.<br> - Kind of a cheesy picture of me, isn't it?<br> - Recognizable, thank heaven.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Get your things together<br> and get down the back stairs<br> before I call the police.<br> I've got something to say.<br> A gangster's moll thinking<br> she'd marry one of my professors.<br> Don't worry,<br> I'm not marrying any professor.<br> - Certainly not.<br> - I'm mink coat. I'm no bungalow apron.<br> That's the guy I'm getting.<br> Pretty good getting for a gal<br> that came up the hard way.<br> We'll have this room fumigated<br> when you're out of it.<br> - Well, you ought to, I guess.<br> - Let me past.<br> No, no, no, any spilling that's to be done,<br> I'll do, but not yet.<br> - Not while it would bug up everything.<br> - If you think I'll hold my tongue...<br> Why don't you look at it this way, Braggo?<br> The harm's been done.<br> Pottsy's gonna wear his heart in a sling<br> whether he finds out sooner or later.<br> Here or in New Jersey<br> won't make any difference to him.<br> Only, in New Jersey's<br> a darned sight better for me.<br> Better for you, indeed.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - Why, you, you...<br> - Open that door or I'll scream.<br> - No, I can't have you screaming, not now.<br> - A piercing scream...<br> - Sorry, Braggo.<br> - What did you say?<br> - What?<br> I was just running<br> through the marriage service.<br> "To be my lawful wedded wife.<br> "For better, for worse,<br> for richer, for poorer."<br> - Please, Pottsy.<br> - What?<br> Don't, please.<br> You're very nervous aren't you, darling?<br> It's been a very exciting day.<br> It's just this business of going to Jersey.<br> I mean, back home.<br> Every time I get to this old bridge,<br> I get worried for fear I might get stuck<br> and not be able to get back over again.<br> We'll bring you back, don't you be afraid.<br> Okay, go ahead.<br> - Hey.<br> - Sorry, sorry.<br> You trying to play piggy-back?<br> Listen to that.<br> - I don't see any reason for sarcasm.<br> - Neither do I.<br> Something wrong with your brakes,<br> sonny?<br> I couldn't locate it for a moment.<br> This is a rented car.<br> - Got a driver's license?<br> - I have, indeed.<br> "1903."<br> This should have been renewed 20 times.<br> - This is as far as you drive, brother.<br> - No, no.<br> But, Officer, this is a wedding party.<br> A wedding party?<br> - Are you the bridegroom?<br> - No, I am.<br> - Is this the bride?<br> - Yes.<br> - Pardon me.<br> - Officer, please.<br> What is it?<br> It's good luck to touch a bride,<br> and I got a promotion coming up.<br> Well, could you reciprocate<br> by letting us proceed?<br> - Yes, we'll drive very carefully.<br> - Yes.<br> Postponing a wedding<br> is bad luck, you know, Officer.<br> That's right.<br> Well, what are you waiting for?<br> - Get going.<br> - Okay.<br> A very nice gentleman.<br> All that nonsense with my driving license.<br> With that license I once drove<br> President Theodore Roosevelt.<br> And he pronounced my driving bully.<br> - He said that...<br> - Look out! Look out!<br> Look out, look out!<br> Help! Help!<br> Police! Police! Help! Help!<br> How's that, operator? No answer.<br> - Jam it.<br> - Jam it.<br> Huh?<br> All right, I didn't mean to say it, I'm sorry.<br> Hey, wait a minute,<br> there's a car driving up now.<br> Listen, sister, I said I was sorry.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Send you a bouquet of...<br> It's you, wait a minute.<br> Hey, it's Sugarpuss.<br> Sugie, say,<br> what the sweet Judas gives out?<br> Where are you?<br> We're not down here to enjoy ourselves.<br> This is a wedding.<br> A what? They had an accident.<br> Nothing serious.<br> No, it just shook the old boys up a little.<br> I couldn't get to a phone before.<br> I don't know,<br> some little hotel near Kingston.<br> Poplar Grove, it's called. Yeah.<br> Oh, sure, Joe,<br> there's a midnight bus. I can grab that.<br> Midnight bus, what are you talking about?<br> I'll have Asthma and Pastrami<br> pick you up in about 40 minutes.<br> Sure tonight.<br> I've got a justice of the peace on call.<br> There'll be a justice<br> of the peace tomorrow.<br> Now, why not do this thing right?<br> I want to wait until the old boys go to bed.<br> I can't walk out on them cold.<br> Maybe you'd like to sit down<br> and knit them eight little sweaters<br> to remember you by.<br> I've told you how it's going to be,<br> now stop barking orders.<br> So long.<br> Get the car ready.<br> I could prove to you<br> by the laws of relativity<br> that it was not I who ran into the signpost,<br> but that it was the signpost which ran...<br> That's all right, go ahead, sit down.<br> But that it was the signpost<br> which ran into me.<br> Let me explain.<br> If you do, by that same law,<br> your head will run into this bottle.<br> - Before you do that, I'd like a drink, please.<br> - By all means, excuse me.<br> No, I think I'll hit the hay, get some sleep.<br> - Why?<br> - The evening's young yet.<br> Oh, no, I don't belong here.<br> This is a bachelor dinner.<br> - But this one is different.<br> - No, that's the law.<br> We've heard from the garage.<br> The car will be ready in the morning.<br> Perhaps it will hold together<br> until Rancocas.<br> Then we'll be leaving early.<br> Yeah, after issuing an urgent appeal<br> to all signposts not to charge at us.<br> That's right.<br> What...<br> What time shall we waken you,<br> about 7:30?<br> I'll be awake all right.<br> Well, kids, here's to you.<br> - Here's to you.<br> - Here's to all of us.<br> Yes, to all of us.<br> Pottsy, I...<br> You know,<br> you boys still have time to warn him.<br> - A man is a goof to marry any woman.<br> - Just let them try to warn me.<br> He'll have to console us that<br> there aren't seven more just like you.<br> - Yeah, one for each of us.<br> - Of assorted ages, of course.<br> Naturally.<br> I...<br> Well, I...<br> I'd like to keep you all in a locket, always.<br> Eight squirrelly cherubs<br> right out of this world.<br> - Bye, kids.<br> - Good night.<br> Goodnight.<br> Did you hear, Potts?<br> I'm a squirrelly cherub.<br> No, no, no.<br> No, I insist, the happiest marriages<br> are those which produce three children<br> at intervals of not less than two<br> or more than three years.<br> Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.<br> You are all speaking very glibly<br> about a subject<br> of which you know practically nothing.<br> No, I know what I'm saying.<br> If you feel the need of any guidance,<br> may I suggest that you turn to me.<br> That's right.<br> You were married, weren't you?<br> Oh, yes. Genevieve has been dead<br> for some 24 years but...<br> I have relived every moment<br> of our happiness so many times.<br> And my experience<br> is entirely at your disposal, Bertram.<br> Thank you, Oddly, but I really...<br> I judge I do not have to start<br> with basic principles.<br> Being...<br> Being a botanist,<br> I find an astonishing parallel<br> between a woman's heart<br> and the wind flower<br> or Anemone nemorosa.<br> Perhaps you know the plant,<br> how it waits for the warm sunshine<br> and soft winds before it unfolds its petals.<br> Sensitive and delicate.<br> One rough, impetuous bee<br> can completely destroy the bloom.<br> Come out of the garden, will you, Oddly?<br> - Jerome.<br> - Have a heart.<br> I'm much obliged to you, Oddly, but I...<br> Please, please, Bertram.<br> Think of me as an elder brother<br> or father, anxious to send you off properly.<br> As we all are. Of course.<br> Now, tenderness,<br> that is what I advocate.<br> Tenderness and patience.<br> Genevieve was a watercolorist.<br> Therefore, after the wedding reception,<br> we went straight to the Catskills.<br> We spent there a beautiful week<br> filled with promise.<br> And returned to New York<br> with 14 excellent watercolors.<br> Fourteen watercolors.<br> Back in New York, I flung my enthusiasm<br> into preparing a lecture,<br> "The Flora of the Catskills,"<br> whilst Genevieve painted<br> a flight of swallows<br> around the walls of our living room.<br> Ah, me.<br> I remember for three months,<br> every time I bade her goodnight<br> I would kiss the palm of her little hand,<br> astonished at my own boldness.<br> What did you say<br> the name of the flower was?<br> Anemone nemorosa,<br> of the buttercup family.<br> Genevieve was a blonde.<br> Here is a lock of her hair.<br> - Very lovely.<br> - Yes.<br> I remember, it used to shine a great deal.<br> And there was a song at that time<br> everyone sang.<br> Unfortunately, I can never carry a tune.<br> That's it.<br> Please sing it all.<br> Does anyone else know it?<br> Please sing it again.<br> Please, go on.<br> Thank you, thank you so much.<br> Good boy.<br> Robinson, what did you make<br> of what Oddly was saying?<br> Don't ask me, Potts. He's the expert.<br> - What's his bungalow number?<br> - I don't know. Ask Peagram.<br> Peagram, what's the number<br> of Oddly's bungalow?<br> He's in six.<br> Oddly?<br> I'm sorry, Oddly,<br> but I've got to talk this out.<br> I must get this off my chest<br> before it stifles me.<br> If you don't mind,<br> we won't turn on the light<br> while we're discussing<br> these things extremely personal.<br> What you said,<br> I recognize the beauty and delicacy<br> of the relationship you described.<br> But I'm... I don't trust myself.<br> I'm afraid<br> I'm a lot bolder than you are, Oddly.<br> You don't think that would necessarily<br> endanger everything? Do you?<br> Why, the very idea that I should<br> have to spend my honeymoon<br> watching her paint in watercolors<br> just because she's like somebody<br> from the buttercup family, I...<br> I'm a man in love.<br> It's the first time in my life.<br> I want to take her in my arms.<br> I thought because I was young,<br> I had self-control but that's not true.<br> I think of her every waking moment.<br> Why, if this marriage had been delayed,<br> I mean, should have been delayed,<br> I mean, should be...<br> Listen to that.<br> Oddly, I don't know my tenses anymore.<br> I've gone goofy, completely goofy,<br> bim-buggy, slap-happy.<br> Can a man like that keep his mind<br> on the Anemone nemorosa?<br> - Pottsy.<br> - What...<br> I'm sorry, I don't know<br> how I could have made such a mistake.<br> To say such things to a woman.<br> You'll have to forgive me.<br> Don't apologize, Pottsy.<br> It was illuminating.<br> Professor Potts!<br> - Somebody is calling me.<br> - Are they?<br> Maybe it's just as well.<br> - Professor Potts!<br> - Professor Potts!<br> I'll be back.<br> - Were you calling me?<br> - Yes, we were, Potts.<br> Potts, something has come up.<br> - Yes, well...<br> - Well, what?<br> - You better tell him, Martin.<br> - Maybe he'd better tell him.<br> - Who?<br> - Potts.<br> There's a gentleman here. No.<br> There's a man here. No.<br> - Four men, four men inside.<br> - Yes, they'll tell you.<br> - Well, what...<br> - So you're the bridegroom?<br> - Yes. This is Professor Potts.<br> - How are you, Bertram?<br> I thought<br> you'd look like these other squats,<br> only with a beard and pea soup on it.<br> What about me evoked<br> this interest on your part?<br> - Sounds like it was engraved, don't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What is this all about?<br> - It's about Sugarpuss.<br> - Perhaps if we talked to him...<br> - There's been too many detours as is.<br> Maybe you recognize my voice, Bertram,<br> do you?<br> How's your sinus?<br> - You're not her father.<br> - You're getting warm.<br> I'm her daddy.<br> Shut up.<br> I believe I'm entitled to some clarification.<br> So am I.<br> Lipstick.<br> What are you doing?<br> Calm down now, Wimpy.<br> I was kind of counting on Sugarpuss<br> to tell you the score.<br> Trouble is she's all right giving out<br> with the twists and the wise cracks.<br> When it comes to leveling off,<br> she gets chicken.<br> He's trying to say that our wedding trip<br> was nothing but a vast lie.<br> A vast lie?<br> Don't you believe it, Bertram.<br> There's going to be a wedding all right,<br> with Sugarpuss the bride.<br> Only I'm the bridegroom.<br> Shake it off.<br> I certainly do appreciate the way<br> you guys delivered a hot cargo.<br> She was to be handled with care.<br> - Potts, it seems that your bride to be...<br> - His bride. That's a laugh.<br> It seems that Sugarpuss has used us<br> to circumvent the police.<br> - We serving as protective coloration.<br> Yes.<br> I don't believe it.<br> Professor, you really thought<br> she was going to marry you<br> with your $3,000 what-was-it a year?<br> She spends that much<br> for having her toenails painted.<br> She sulks if she has to wear<br> last year's ermine.<br> He don't believe it. Look at him.<br> All right. Suppose you go tell Sugarpuss<br> Daddy's here.<br> Joe Lilac's the name.<br> Professor Potts! Professor Potts!<br> - Why, Miss Bragg.<br> - Is it too late?<br> Have you married that girl?<br> She knocked me out.<br> Nine hours in a closet.<br> Something told me all along.<br> Hold the phone, sister.<br> We traced you through your accident.<br> There's a warrant from the DA's office<br> for this girlfriend of Lilac's.<br> Where is she?<br> There's a Mr. Lilac waiting for you.<br> Yeah.<br> The situation has been explained to me<br> in simple terms.<br> You don't have to worry about the police.<br> I told them you and he left a half hour ago.<br> Probably were in Trenton by now.<br> - Thanks, Pottsy.<br> - Thanks for what?<br> You've given us all a fine course in<br> the theory and practice of being a sucker.<br> It was a very small tuition fee.<br> Perhaps it wasn't quite worthy<br> of you choosing us<br> as subjects of your demonstration.<br> Eight pushovers,<br> like shooting fish in a barrel.<br> I...<br> I didn't want you to get it this way.<br> Not right in the face.<br> I've been...<br> I've been sitting here<br> trying to write you a letter.<br> Here are all my excuses.<br> The handwriting of a...<br> What would be your word for it?<br> A tramp.<br> - Good morning, Miss Bragg.<br> - Good morning, gentlemen.<br> What about some nice hot breakfast?<br> I made some Parker House rolls.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Even have some jam.<br> Strawberry jam, Professor Oddly.<br> Thank you, Miss Bragg,<br> but I don't think so.<br> - Nobody wants any breakfast?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Why? What? Very well.<br> Gentlemen, just a moment, please.<br> Before we attempt to get back to work,<br> I'd like to say a few words.<br> You've been very kind and very tactful.<br> If I may say so, over-tactful.<br> The entire ride home in the car,<br> you avoided a certain subject<br> and made empty conversation.<br> Now, let's have it out.<br> I made an ass of myself and I know it.<br> Oh, well, we all have, Potts.<br> Yes, but I was the lead donkey.<br> Why not just regard the episode<br> as a prolonged constitutional?<br> That's right. That's what we'll do.<br> Thank you.<br> What happened to our emotions<br> can't be undone.<br> What happened to our work<br> must be remedied.<br> I'm sorry, but because of me<br> we must work two extra hours a day.<br> In a month,<br> we'll be back on schedule again.<br> - Sure.<br> - That's right.<br> Now, we are all scholars.<br> Let us withdraw behind our wall of books,<br> and may her name never<br> be brought up in this house again.<br> - We didn't mention it, Potts.<br> - Not even by omitting it so obviously.<br> Excuse me, Bertram, but...<br> Well, now that<br> we are burying her memory,<br> I feel it only fair, you see,<br> she gave me something for you.<br> I found her crying in her bungalow,<br> and she slipped your ring into my pocket.<br> Put it in the wastebasket, please, Oddly.<br> Just a moment.<br> Just a moment.<br> - Is this your ring, Potts?<br> - That for $39.85?<br> - Doesn't look like it.<br> - Why, no it is not.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Positive.<br> Because if this is the one she gave<br> back to you and not the one you gave her,<br> it's enormously interesting.<br> - But why?<br> - Why? How so?<br> Potts.<br> - She loves you.<br> - How can you say that?<br> Please, she happened<br> to pull that one off by mistake.<br> - Not according to Professor Freud.<br> - Freud?<br> The subconscious mind<br> never makes mistakes.<br> She gave you the ring she didn't want,<br> his ring.<br> And she kept the one she wanted, yours.<br> - That's right, Potts.<br> - Bosh and nonsense.<br> I agree with Miss Bragg.<br> I refuse to be coddled with<br> a lot of psychoanalytical nonsense.<br> As one who understands a woman's heart,<br> I would like to...<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> Quite an eventful night<br> last night, gentlemen.<br> At least, so we see by the papers.<br> We're quite fresh this morning, however.<br> And we're going back to work with a will.<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> - There's no hurry about that.<br> - Not any longer.<br> - We've had quite enough of your activities.<br> It has cost the estate some $300,000<br> to at last have its name<br> spread across every tabloid in New York.<br> "Night club babe hides out<br> in Totten Foundation."<br> - And this one.<br> - Yes.<br> "Professor bridegroom carries<br> ball of fire across state line."<br> And many others like it.<br> For my father, I feel profound humiliation.<br> For myself, unutterable disgust.<br> - Shall I go ahead?<br> - Please.<br> For the aforesaid reasons,<br> Miss Totten has decided<br> to discontinue the encyclopedia.<br> What?<br> - How soon can you vacate?<br> - Vacate? After nine years?<br> - Expelled in disgrace?<br> - Pull the chair from under us?<br> Thrown out like eight old shoes?<br> I'm sorry, gentlemen,<br> but my mind's made up.<br> Go ahead, Mr. Larsen.<br> Several real estate firms<br> are interested in this property.<br> One of the companies wants to erect<br> an apartment house here, giving you...<br> Whoa! Please don't do that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> One word, Miss Totten, may I?<br> In your very understandable excitement,<br> a great injustice is being done.<br> I am the guilty one.<br> And I accept my dishonorable discharge<br> without protest,<br> but that others should suffer<br> and be punished<br> for my misconduct<br> is unthinkable.<br> Oh, my goodness, what was that?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> Everybody line up over there,<br> like for a photograph.<br> With you, Bertram, in the foreground.<br> Come on, get going.<br> Get around, get around. Go on.<br> Faster. Keep moving.<br> Saint Valentine's Day!<br> Is the bride ready yet?<br> - No, not yet.<br> - What?<br> - Louder, please.<br> - We're still talking it over.<br> Good idea. Important step.<br> - Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?<br> - For lunch. Five minutes late.<br> - When are you going to be back?<br> - After I've ate and had my nap.<br> How long are we gonna argue this?<br> - Now look, Sugie.<br> - I said no. And no is no.<br> Sugie, when I was nine years old,<br> I was in love with my piano teacher.<br> She played classical.<br> You're not nine years old.<br> I love him.<br> - She loves him.<br> - Yes, I love him.<br> I love those hick shirts he wears<br> with the boiled cuffs.<br> And the way he always has<br> his vest buttoned wrong.<br> Looks like a giraffe and I love him.<br> I love him because he's the kind of a guy<br> that gets drunk on a glass of buttermilk.<br> And I love the way<br> he blushes right up over his ears.<br> I love him because he doesn't know<br> how to kiss, the jerk.<br> I love him, Joe.<br> That's what I'm trying to tell you.<br> I'll never see him again.<br> But I'm not gonna marry you.<br> Not if you tie a ton of cement<br> around my neck<br> and throw me into the East River<br> like you did to all the others.<br> - I tell you, Joe was framed.<br> - Oh, sure, sure.<br> So you tell me, I know better now.<br> I guess she'd better talk to her professor.<br> Get him on the phone.<br> You leave him out of this.<br> Imagine that big giraffe<br> at the bottom of the East River.<br> You wouldn't like that to happen<br> to him, would you, Sugarpuss?<br> - That ain't funny, McGee.<br> - Who said it's funny?<br> I mean business.<br> That is if you don't say "I do"<br> like a nice little bride.<br> Uh-uh.<br> I kind of figured you'd bumped your brains<br> into one of them pink clouds.<br> - You can't do this, Joe.<br> - It's too late, Sugie.<br> - The pressure's on already.<br> - What is this? Putting the screws on me?<br> You said it,<br> and right where it'll do the most good.<br> - Neighborhood of the heart.<br> - Hello.<br> This is McNeary. Hang on. Here you are.<br> You take it.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello, Sugie.<br> Sure, it's Pastrami.<br> Just dropped in on the boys,<br> Asthma and me,<br> with our little old typewriters.<br> That's up to the boss.<br> We're waiting for orders.<br> - For orders?<br> - Can we make a deal now, Sugie?<br> Sure we can, brother.<br> Put him on, Pastrami, just a word.<br> Would you mind stepping<br> to the phone, Professor Potts?<br> A lady friend of yours.<br> I have nothing to say to Miss O'Shea.<br> - Oh, please, please!<br> - You haven't?<br> Just a moment.<br> Goodness, this is awful.<br> Yesterday, a nightclub...<br> Shut your clam, sister.<br> Hello.<br> Yes, Miss O'Shea, this is Professor Potts.<br> Your friends are here.<br> Not at all.<br> Your methods are familiar by now.<br> I don't know the exact purpose<br> of this maneuver.<br> What more can be gained from us?<br> But I hope<br> that it works to your advantage.<br> I'm sorry, Pottsy,<br> but it'll be all right in a little while.<br> They won't hurt anybody.<br> Just don't do anything foolish.<br> - Promise me, Pottsy.<br> - Give it.<br> Okay, Bertram, put Pastrami back on.<br> I imagine he wants to talk to you.<br> Yes, boss?<br> Okay, we'll wait for the call.<br> And best wishes, boss. Congratulations.<br> Well, all we have to do<br> is to wait for the all-clear signal.<br> We'll dismiss the class<br> right after the ceremony.<br> - Did you say after the ceremony?<br> - That's what I said.<br> You mean they're not married yet?<br> Why do you think<br> we're futzing around with these?<br> Well, I don't know, I thought...<br> A little trouble with Sugarpuss'<br> vocal chords. Wouldn't say yes.<br> She wouldn't say yes? What...<br> You very ugly young man,<br> you know, to me at this moment<br> you look perfectly delightful?<br> - I mean absolutely beautiful.<br> - I what?<br> - Positively wonderful.<br> - Are you nuts?<br> No, I feel like yodeling.<br> Pardon me.<br> Dr. Gurkakoff,<br> my apologies to Professor Freud.<br> Thank you.<br> But you don't understand.<br> This visit is no longer a mystery.<br> Apparently, it requires those two guns<br> leveled on us<br> to force Sugarpuss to marry Mr. Lilac.<br> - You mean to say that...<br> - Yes.<br> - That explains everything.<br> - Break it up, break it up.<br> - We can't allow that.<br> - No, no, indeed.<br> Can't, huh?<br> What do you think we're here for?<br> But, young man, you see,<br> we all love this young lady very dearly.<br> Better look out. It's gonna spit.<br> What is going to... Oh, dear.<br> - Now, sit down, all of you. Sit down.<br> - Yes, we're... I mean, we're...<br> Ah.<br> Don't look so big now,<br> them eight big brains.<br> Not to me they don't.<br> You are under the impression<br> that you are big<br> because you have those firearms<br> because you know how to load them<br> and pull the trigger.<br> It would be interesting<br> to teach them the contrary...<br> Button it up, understand?<br> Hey, fellows, this won't take a second.<br> They're pulling a double or nothing<br> on that quizzola.<br> Three new questions. First.<br> "The sword of Damocles, was that a..."<br> Say, was you holding a meeting<br> or something?<br> More like a wake, maybe.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Just a minute, Jack.<br> We got a loge seat for you,<br> right in the back row.<br> This way, please.<br> That's right.<br> Now, sit down.<br> Young man, your...<br> You don't mind if we talk, do you?<br> - Just keep it funny.<br> - Thank you.<br> Your question as you came in was about<br> the sword of Damocles, I believe.<br> Yeah.<br> - But I'd just as soon skip it.<br> - No, but it's a very interesting subject.<br> - Never mind.<br> - Yeah, but I do mind.<br> I just wanted to tell you<br> that the sword of Damocles<br> was suspended over his head.<br> - Yes, by a single hair.<br> - Exactly.<br> Did you hear that, Robinson?<br> Suspended over his head by a single hair.<br> A constant source of danger.<br> Mr. Pastrami,<br> you know your history, don't you?<br> It's not one of my best points.<br> I never went in for that kind of stuff.<br> - At least, not very much.<br> - Well, I thought I'd just ask you.<br> - A very interesting lesson indeed.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, indeed. I've always found it<br> a most absorbing subject.<br> But Mr. Totten is not suspended by a hair.<br> Uh-uh.<br> No secrets, boys, talk upstairs.<br> - I thought you'd see it.<br> - Don't you agree, Dr. Gurkakoff?<br> - What did you say?<br> - I said, don't you agree?<br> Yes, yes, yes. A danger very often<br> overhangs the unsuspecting.<br> What kind of jive is that?<br> If you're gonna talk, talk so we can dig it.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. We'll try.<br> - Dr. Gurkakoff?<br> - Yeah?<br> What was that about<br> the Roman fleet and Archimedes?<br> I don't remember.<br> You know, it's not exactly...<br> Why, he set it afire<br> with the use of reflectors.<br> You can talk just as well sitting down,<br> can't you?<br> Yes, yes.<br> I find that vastly instructive,<br> don't you, Dr. Gurkakoff?<br> Extremely enlightening.<br> - Potts, you were saying...<br> - Yes.<br> Now if I... May I stand?<br> - Sure, if it's gonna help.<br> - Thank you, it will a lot.<br> Now, if I may have your attention<br> for a few moments.<br> Gentlemen,<br> you see your inferiority is a question<br> of the bony structure of your skulls.<br> - What's the matter with our skulls?<br> - Now, just listen, please.<br> Let us take<br> the glandular syncopation of your eyes.<br> Kindly look at me, both of you.<br> It's very important.<br> They are the doliocephalic and<br> the brachiocephalic<br> with a somewhat<br> Mediterranean estrafuge.<br> Now try to follow me closely.<br> Now, the double smorgasbord<br> of your chins, for instance,<br> convexing into<br> the cataclysmic protoplasm...<br> Am I boring you?<br> - I don't get it.<br> - Now, the latest centrifugal research<br> as performed by<br> Bronxville scientists has proven<br> that syllogism is enigmatic to prolonged<br> resistance, especially in the cavalry.<br> Now take your ears.<br> The totalitarian mastoid<br> of their basic lobes prematurely<br> extricated from the paranoiac agriculture<br> - and molecular cadenzas...<br> - Get down to it.<br> - What's wrong with us?<br> - Nothing.<br> You're just fine. Everything's fine.<br> Now, on one hand<br> we have the sword of Damocles,<br> and on the other hand we have...<br> Professor Quintana,<br> would you look up something<br> in Tate's Oriental Philosophy for me?<br> - I think I saw it last on your desk.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - Line one, chapter seven.<br> - Yes.<br> Do you mind?<br> Hey, this mixed-up talk<br> is giving me a headache.<br> All that book talk. That's a lot of mahaha.<br> I assure you this is not a lot of mahaha.<br> This is...<br> I'll show you<br> what makes the world go round.<br> Kind of spread out a little bit, will you?<br> - My globe! My globe!<br> - Me, I don't like globes.<br> Now me.<br> I saw me a picture last week.<br> There's gonna be a lot<br> of trash tomorrow, sister.<br> If there is any tomorrow, brother.<br> Ain't there some more of<br> them things around?<br> - Don't get up, please, just...<br> - Please.<br> What's the matter with all of you?<br> We thought...<br> - Young man.<br> - What do you want?<br> Do you think you could shoot this dime<br> if I held it between my fingers?<br> Why, sure.<br> I mean...<br> I mean from where you were sitting.<br> Okay.<br> All right, put it up.<br> - Perhaps we'd better use a quarter.<br> - Well, that's twice as easy.<br> I'm glad.<br> Or maybe even a 50-cent piece?<br> He's not as dumb as he looks.<br> Has anyone change for $1?<br> Never mind, never mind.<br> A quarter will do. Put it up.<br> - Oh, no, I can get change.<br> - Never mind, put it up.<br> I've got him!<br> - Hold him, hold him.<br> - I've got him.<br> New Jersey? That's an awful big order.<br> Whereabouts in Jersey?<br> You just keep on driving.<br> Further orders will be forthcoming.<br> I warned you, Miss Totten,<br> you should never have come along.<br> It may be very dangerous.<br> This is my encyclopedia,<br> and I am going to stick with it.<br> I've never had so much fun in my life.<br> How are they doing inside?<br> Are we ready?<br> - Shall we start the torture now?<br> - Just one moment.<br> First, we are going to give him<br> just one chance to talk.<br> Where is that ceremony taking place?<br> Listen, monkey, I've been given<br> the third degree by all kinds of cops.<br> - All over.<br> - But not by us.<br> You will see, I am an authority<br> on Chinese tortures.<br> That tickles!<br> - Are you ready, Dr. Gurkakoff?<br> - That's right.<br> - Now, between the 12th and 13th vertebra.<br> - No!
