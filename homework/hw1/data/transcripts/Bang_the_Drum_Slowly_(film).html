                        Actually, you get over it<br> fairly quick.<br> You might not think so,<br> but it's true.<br> You're driving along<br> with a man<br> who's been told he's dying<br> and yet everything<br> keeps going on.<br> I mean, it'd been hard enough<br> rooming with him<br> when he was well.<br> He chewed<br> this disgusting tobacco<br> he pissed in the sink,<br> and as a catcher<br> he was a million dollars<br> worth of promise<br> worth two cents on delivery.<br> Most people didn't even know<br> he was with the club<br> and, um, he was almost too dumb<br> to play a joke on...<br> and now he'd been played<br> the biggest joke of all.<br> Bill! Oh, Bill!<br> Hi, Mom.<br> Oh, Bruce,<br> I'm so happy to see you.<br> I'm so glad you're home.<br> Hey, Bruce, Bruce,<br> how are you, son?<br> Hi, Dad.<br> It's so good<br> to see you.<br> - How you been?<br> - Okay.<br> You're looking good.<br> Oh, I feel... feel fine.<br> Daddy, Mama,<br> I want you to meet Henry.<br> You can call him Arthur.<br> Oh, I tell you,<br> it's an honor<br> to have you here,<br> Henry Wiggen.<br> I can't believe it.<br> I can't believe<br> I'm here.<br> Wonders never cease,<br> Papa.<br> - Howdy, Mr. Bruce.<br> - Hi.<br> - You all better now?<br> - Yeah.<br> We was worried.<br> Well, I was in good hands.<br> I bet it was cold<br> up there.<br> Not too damn cold, Mama.<br> What was wrong?<br> Nothing.<br> Arthur, tell me why in hell<br> I swam up and down this mud<br> a million times<br> and I never drownded<br> Why I never got killed<br> in the war in Vietnam<br> or why I never<br> got plastered by a truck<br> but I come<br> clean through all that<br> and now I get this disease.<br> Arthur?<br> Don't ask me questions<br> I can't answer.<br> Well, I been handed<br> a shit deal, boy.<br> I'm doomed.<br> Shh...<br> Arthur, you know that game<br> you and Joe Jaros played,<br> tegwar?<br> How you play it?<br> - Tegwar?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> You don't know<br> how to play tegwar?<br> Spell it.<br> T-E-G-W-A-R.<br> Stands for "The Exciting Game<br> Without Any Rules."<br> T-E-G-W-A-R.<br> No rules.<br> No rules at all?<br> I'm not too sure<br> I'm understanding this game.<br> You might never.<br> Throw down<br> in the middle, sir.<br> Why? Nobody else<br> threw down in the middle.<br> It's your fish-fly card.<br> How can you tell?<br> It's the rules.<br> When the rules are wrong.<br> What rules?<br> I haven't been noticing<br> any rules.<br> They seem to keep changing.<br> Five and six or 11, that's why.<br> Attaboy, Bruce.<br> Rules concerning what?<br> The rules of arithmetic.<br> I wouldn't play this game<br> for money, I can tell you.<br> Don't be discouraged.<br> Don't be discouraged.<br> See, it was no double birdie.<br> Double birdie?<br> Whereas where<br> it could've been a spread-eagle.<br> Probably you've been playing<br> southeastern tegwar<br> all your life,<br> but in the Majors<br> the boys all play<br> Western Canadian style<br> which, for my money,<br> is much faster.<br> That leaves you free<br> for a... butchered hog<br> most any time, whereas...<br> Whereas, uh...<br> whereas...<br> Whereas what?<br> Well, whereas it, uh<br> keeps you from dropping dead<br> on the board.<br> Hello, there, old lady!<br> Hi.

Let's go.<br> Okay, stand close.<br> Put your arms<br> around each other's shoulders.<br> I'd rather not.<br> I'm very high on him,<br> very high.<br> He's got all the tools.<br> He hits them a mile.<br> He runs like a deer.<br> His backside's one mile wide<br> by actual measurement<br> where his power is.<br> Drinks milk by the tons.<br> Who will stay?<br> Aw, how do I know<br> in February<br> who I'll love in April<br> when the flowers bloom, huh?<br> No, no, flowers<br> bloom in May.<br> It's April showers.<br> Smartest prospect<br> in years.<br> Henry, how many<br> catchers on a team?<br> Never that many.<br> Here's the premium<br> from George, Arthur.<br> Gracias, George.<br> George says,<br> "Sign your contract, Arthur."<br> Morning, Arthur, Holly.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey, Ugly.<br> Uh, I believe this, uh,<br> brings my insurance up to date.<br> Keep it coming;<br> it's your future.<br> Well, uh, I have to save some<br> for the present, however<br> such as, uh, these little girls<br> running around here<br> with their eye<br> on handsome ball players.<br> How much<br> you holding out for?<br> $127,500.<br> Well, even if I believed you,<br> you'll never get it<br> but as a veteran<br> of many a holdout<br> let me give you<br> a piece of sound advice:<br> Don't hang in the park<br> because your eye gleams,<br> your hand itches<br> and you wish<br> you were playing ball.<br> It shines through, Arthur,<br> and it'll cost you money.<br> It's the boss.<br> Don't be too comical;<br> just answer it.<br> Let it ring awhile.<br> Fishing pier;<br> tapeworms for sale.<br> Hey, Arthur, how<br> about coming down<br> and playing a game<br> of duo tegwar?<br> It's not the boss;<br> it's Joe Jaros.<br> Arthur, come on down.<br> This place is<br> swimming with fish.<br> All right, we'll be right down.<br> Who's "we"?<br> Well, me and Bruce.<br> Bruce Pearson?<br> Yeah, um... him<br> and me played<br> quite a bit of tegwar<br> over the winter.<br> He's a great player.<br> I'll stay here.<br> Forget it for today, Joe.<br> No, Henry, you go.<br> Bruce and I will stay here.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> You okay?<br> Yeah, go.<br> I'll be right down, Joe.<br> Would you mind if I watch?<br> Quarter to 11:00.<br> No, I said,<br> "Would you mind if I watch?"<br> Paging Mr. Donald Graham.<br> Mr. Donald Graham.<br> You're Henry Wiggen.<br> Paging Mr. Donald Graham.<br> Hey, would you mind if I sit in?<br> You know, I read your book, too.<br> I didn't read<br> your book, Arthur<br> but I will, I will, I plan to.<br> So far, I've just been concerned<br> with the parts that concern me.<br> Hey, who did you used to be?<br> I'm Joe Jaros.<br> I'm a coach.<br> I used to be a baby.<br> These are fifth and two,<br> fifth and queen.<br> Red rooster.<br> Banjo!<br> That's the first<br> natural banjo I've had<br> since the days of Joe DiMaggio<br> in St. Petersburg.<br> Hey, wait a minute, here.<br> Hey, what's the name<br> of this game?<br> is 32.<br> Oh, that's right.<br> That's a double honeybees.<br> I'm not sure if I'm too clear<br> on some of these new rules.<br> What new rules?<br> There hasn't been any new rules<br> since the Black Sox scandal,<br> Big league tegwar<br> is big league tegwar<br> known to every<br> big-time ballplayer<br> from Boston to California.<br> And this is the last time<br> we play without Pearson, Joe.<br> Arthur, your mind is crumbling.<br> He's too damn dumb.<br> - Promise me, Joe.<br> - I promise you.<br> I promise you.<br> I promise on a stack of cards.<br> Anyway, the way<br> that Banjo's been hitting<br> Pearson's sure<br> to drift down and out.<br> They're sending him down?<br> I didn't say nothing.<br> Well, that's it, then,<br> they're releasing Pearson?<br> Well, don't it look<br> quite obvious?<br> Well, they can't do that.<br> Paging Mr. Wiggen.<br> Paging Mr. Henry Wiggen.<br> Please pick up<br> the house telephone.<br> Forget it, Arthur.<br> Stick around, hang on.<br> It's the boss.<br> I got to go, Joe.<br> Damn it, Arthur, stick around!<br> Fair? You call that fair?<br> I was taught in school<br> where slavery went out<br> when Lincoln was shot!<br> Yeah, so you wrote<br> across your contract.<br> Not across my contract.<br> Maybe the contract<br> of turnstile turner.<br> Young players<br> often end up<br> old turnstile turners.<br> All right, let's all calm down.<br> You're looking very healthy<br> this morning.<br> Henry, you keep talking<br> about $125,000.<br> I can't do business<br> that way.<br> We'll just have to get along<br> without him.<br> Some of those pitchers out there<br> yesterday afternoon<br> looked very promising.<br> So I hear.<br> Any one of them might win<br> four or five games<br> if God drops everything else.<br> I have in my mind<br> an absolute maximum figure of...<br> $60,000.<br> If you have a good year<br> this year<br> we'll make it back<br> to you next year.<br> I will go on year after year<br> being paid for the year before.<br> Now, that shorts me a year<br> in the long run.<br> We've heard<br> this one before.<br> Every time Bradley Lord<br> opens his mouth<br> I'm raising<br> my absolute minimum figure.<br> All right, Henry...<br> Bradley. Bradley!<br> I have in my mind<br> an absolute maximum figure<br> of $60,000.<br> But she has in her heart<br> $10,000 more.<br> That's $70,000.<br> I'd think you'd jump<br> at that arrangement.<br> Leap at that arrangement.<br> I'll take it.<br> Good.<br> Well, then it's settled.<br> There's something I want<br> instead of money.<br> Nothing is instead of money.<br> Oh, money can buy nothing<br> but happiness.<br> There's one clause yet<br> to go in my contract.<br> All right, shoot.<br> There must be a clause saying<br> that I and Bruce Pearson<br> will stay with the club together<br> or else go together.<br> Whatever happens to one,<br> must happen to the other...<br> traded, sold, whatever.<br> We got to be tied in a package<br> on any deal under the sun.<br> I never heard<br> of such a thing.<br> No. Absolutely out of<br> the question.<br> Reason one, Dutch would never<br> hear of such a thing.<br> Look here, Henry<br> if you want to have<br> to get started this way<br> you better just watch out.<br> Bradley, now let's just think<br> before we speak.<br> Look, we won't bother<br> to write it down.<br> I give you my solemn word.<br> No verbal words...<br> must be wrote in.<br> Bradley, call Dutch.<br> It's his one day off.<br> Call him.<br> They should put zippers<br> on pajamas.<br> Tell him your clause.<br> Oh. So it's you with<br> the special clause, Arthur.<br> I'll bet it's a dilly.<br> Bradley, run and get me<br> a wet rag, huh?<br> Everybody thinks<br> they're special.<br> Sterling must be shot<br> for hay fever<br> with medicine made<br> out of the piss of a horse<br> Darochi must have<br> contact lenses<br> Gonzales must have a buddy<br> along to translate in Spanish<br> and Goldman must go home<br> for Passover.<br> What do you want now, Arthur,<br> Chinese New Year's?<br> I want a clause tying me<br> in a package with Pearson.<br> I'll bet he owes you money.<br> Jesus, Bradley.<br> You ain't got much strength<br> in your hands.<br> What do you mean<br> tied in a package?<br> If he's sold, I must be sold<br> or if he's traded,<br> I must be traded same place.<br> Wherever he goes, I go.<br> Well, this is telling me<br> who I must keep and who not<br> which nobody ever told me before<br> and nobody will ever tell me<br> again as long as I'm upright.<br> If it's money,<br> talk money and good luck.<br> They own all the banks.<br> Talking money's one thing<br> but talking business is another<br> and I'd as soon as trade the<br> whole club for a tin of beans<br> as leave anyone tell me who<br> stays and who gets cut loose.<br> I'm sorry to hear that<br> because without that clause,<br> there'll be no contract.<br> Well, then there'll<br> be no contract<br> and I must suffer along<br> the best I can.<br> Several of those young pitchers<br> looked good out there yesterday.<br> Yeah?<br> Good for what?<br> Will you go sell insurance?<br> You don't know a soul on Earth<br> to sell insurance to<br> outside of ball players.<br> Will you sell insurance<br> to other insurance agents, huh?<br> And where will you find<br> people with money,<br> with the language you speak?<br> Henry, I hardly ever<br> even saw you wear a necktie.<br> Bradley...<br> shut up, will you?<br> Go get me a Coke.<br> What's up between you two,<br> Arthur?<br> What are you, a couple<br> of fairies, or something?<br> That can't be.<br> It's been a long time since I<br> run across fairies in baseball.<br> Jesus.<br> This is too much for me.<br> Oh, you'll understand it<br> sometime.<br> When?<br> Oh, I don't know,<br> maybe soon, maybe not.<br> Oh, I'll certainly be hanging<br> from my thumb, waiting to hear.<br> Christ Almighty, I've seen you<br> on days when you hated Pearson<br> when you ate him out as bad<br> as I myself ever ate him out.<br> I saw you once get up<br> from the table and walk away.<br> Well, that could be<br> love as well as hate.<br> It ain't love.<br> I didn't mean fairy love.<br> I remember one time<br> you come storming<br> into my office.<br> You caught him pissing<br> in the sink in Pittsburgh.<br> Cleveland.<br> Urinating.<br> Does this clause go on<br> forever? Hmm?<br> I have four catchers.<br> I have a catcher that's sold<br> on the sauce<br> and a Black catcher<br> that cannot hit<br> and a motorcycle catcher,<br> wild and crazy<br> and Pearson,<br> who's just plumb dumb.<br> I'd give both my right eyes<br> for Sam Mott of Cincinnati<br> but Cincinnati wants Arthur<br> and I can't give Arthur<br> or if I give you, I must have<br> Scutter or Faulkland<br> which the son of a bitches<br> won't give me<br> except for all<br> my right-hand power.<br> I could spare<br> my right-hand hitting<br> if I got Diel with Pittsburgh<br> but Pittsburgh wants Arthur<br> and I've already given you<br> to Cincinnati<br> on paper for Sam Mott.<br> So...<br> I must play my old catcher<br> on days when<br> he gets himself sorted out<br> and play my Black catcher on<br> days when my hitting is hitting<br> and play my motorcycle catcher<br> on days he ever comes<br> to his senses...<br> which so far, he's given me<br> no sign of really having any.<br> I'll ship him down<br> to Queen City<br> and see if they can talk him<br> off his motorcycle.<br> We must never have another<br> motorcycle in camp!<br> I've been trying for days<br> to get some sleep.<br> You know, when I stop<br> and think about it<br> I'm liable to wind up using<br> my plumb dumb catcher<br> more and more.<br> Some day you'll understand.<br> Nah, nah, forget about it.<br> That's too much to ask.<br> All right.<br> I will agree to the clause.<br> I've never done<br> such a thing before<br> and I wouldn't do it now...<br> except there's a look<br> in your eye<br> that tells me I've got to.<br> Oh, Bruce.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Bye.<br> Have a good trip, okay?<br> Okay, I will.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hey, Holly? Holly.<br> - What?<br> You drive careful now.<br> All right.<br> Bye-bye, boys.<br> I'm going to miss you.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> I'll call you collect<br> tonight, okay?<br> - Please.<br> - I will.<br> Bye-bye. Bye, Bruce.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, boy, I hope<br> if it happens<br> it don't happen<br> at a bad hour.<br> It might or might not<br> probably never happen.<br> I have no faith<br> in those cockeyed<br> doctors up there.<br> Curveball.<br> Too bad a fellow<br> can't pitch spit.<br> Yeah, I'd have lots<br> of breaking stuff around.<br> Slider.<br> You see the dip on that?<br> Arthur, if you was on one club<br> and I was on another<br> what kind of book<br> would you keep on me?<br> If I was to keep a book<br> on you, I'd say to myself<br> "No need to keep<br> a book on Pearson<br> 'cause Pearson keeps<br> no book on me"<br> 'cause if I strike<br> you out on something<br> like a change-up in here<br> you don't come back<br> to the bench, thinking<br> "That son of a bitch Wiggen,<br> he struck me out in here.<br> So, I'll be on the<br> lookout the next time."<br> No, no, you come back<br> to the bench, thinking<br> "I think I eat a frank"<br> or, uh, "Gee, I see<br> a great pair of jugs<br> up there in the stands."<br> So, by the time you come up<br> against me again<br> you forgot<br> all about the time before.<br> So, I'll just throw you<br> in the same place again<br> and get past again, probably.<br> You got to think, Bruce...<br> think and remember.<br> I'm going to start keeping<br> a book.<br> Yeah, either in<br> your head or, um...<br> better still, on<br> paper for a while.<br> You already have<br> terrific power<br> but power plus brains<br> is the difference<br> between nobody<br> and somebody.<br> Yeah, well, I always been<br> pretty much of a nobody, though.<br> So, I-I guess what I got to do<br> is I got to develop brains.<br> Plus confidence.<br> Power and brains are<br> nothing without confidence.<br> Well, you always<br> had the confidence.<br> I never had confidence,<br> Arthur.<br> No... but I always looked<br> like I had it, didn't I?<br> Days when I'm tired,<br> my curve is hanging<br> it's bullshit<br> gets me through.<br> You got to crowd<br> in, look fierce.<br> Works wonders.<br> And half the pitchers<br> you're facing<br> they're just country<br> boys like you<br> or else country boys<br> from the city.<br> Country boys from the city?<br> Yeah, they're no<br> smarter than you.<br> Yeah, but I never been smart,<br> that's the thing.<br> Everybody's smart.<br> You've been dumb<br> on one count only...<br> you let somebody tell<br> you you were dumb.<br> Didn't you buy an Arcturis<br> insurance policy?<br> Yeah.<br> Didn't that prove<br> to be a smart move?<br> Well, now, as far as that goes,<br> I can't argue against that.<br> Is Dutch smart?<br> Oh, yeah, he certainly is.<br> Well, if you were so dumb,<br> why ain't Dutch cut you loose?<br> Well, he might yet.<br> Oh, no.<br> Piney Woods goes down,<br> you stay up.<br> Who says so?<br> I heard it with<br> my own ears.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah.<br> Shit.<br> Now that's the best news<br> I heard so far.<br> What's wrong with Bruce?<br> He gave you that<br> ring, did he?<br> Mm.<br> Who says anything is?<br> He says.<br> He says what?<br> He says marry him<br> and cash in on a big surprise.<br> He's nutty.<br> You get that way<br> sitting on the bench<br> too many years.<br> What was he doing<br> in Minnesota?<br> He had pneumonia.<br> Now, what would you go<br> all the way to Minnesota<br> with pneumonia for?<br> Well, whatever it is,<br> it isn't catching.<br> You think I'd be his roomie<br> if it were?<br> Oh, rooming with him's<br> one thing...<br> Ioving's another.<br> Oh, Katie<br> honey, why don't you get<br> yourself married<br> and raise yourself<br> some exemptions?<br> Why don't you play baseball<br> for free, Arthur?<br> Why should a girl go amateur<br> if she's got the stuff<br> to be professional?<br> I don't know why<br> you can't tell me<br> what's wrong with him.<br> Katie, if I knew...<br> you know I'd tell you.<br> Ladies and gentlemen<br> will you please rise<br> and join us in singing<br> our national anthem?<br> O say, can you see<br> By the dawn's early light<br> What so proudly we hail'd<br> At the twilight's<br> last gleaming?<br> Whose broad stripes<br> and bright stars<br> Thro' the perilous fight<br> O'er the ramparts we watch'd<br> Were so gallantly streaming?<br> And the rocket's red glare<br> The bombs bursting in air<br> Gave proof<br> through the night...<br> Why's he sending me down?<br> You'll be back up, Piney.<br> I ought to be back up now.<br> Stick to business<br> and stay off motorcycles.<br> I love motorcycles.<br> Look at that old washout.<br> Don't lose your ticket.<br> Take care of your banjo.<br> Guitar!<br> Say hello for me to everybody<br> down there in Queen City, okay?<br> ...O'er the land<br> of the free...<br> Maybe somebody'll<br> drop dead up here...<br> open up a slot for me.<br> ...And the home<br> of the brave.<br> Well, anything's possible.<br> Life is unfair,<br> I'll tell you that.<br> Get on there.<br> Ladies and gentlemen<br> your attention, please.<br> Today we honor<br> a recently elected immortal<br> Big Benjamin Scotland.<br> Big Ben, pitching for<br> the New York Mammoths<br> struck out<br> Gun it in, Ben!<br> Gun it in!<br> Save this for me.<br> Batting first for Pittsburgh...<br> Hey, man, this one's<br> for the money.<br> ...a left fielder...<br> Play ball!<br> What do you say, Henry?<br> What do you say?<br> All the way, kid.<br> All the way this year.<br> What do you say, Henry?<br> Come to me, boy.<br> Come to me, kid.<br> Swing it through.<br> Right here, kid.<br> What do you say?<br> Wing it strong!<br> Strike!<br> So, you wanted that through!<br> All right!<br> All right!<br> Come on, team!<br> Say, Pearson...<br> I always wondered...<br> exactly how tall are you?<br> Paul, you always did wonder.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah, I heard<br> about it.<br> Yeah?<br> Yes, I did.<br> I'm exactly five feet.<br> I never knew shit piled<br> that high.<br> We were a strong club.<br> We had great pitching<br> with both hands<br> and good relief<br> if FDR Caselli come through.<br> We had the best outfield<br> in baseball, bar none<br> and the best<br> double-play combination.<br> In fact, I didn't think there<br> was anyone who could beat us<br> except maybe ourselves.<br> We started ragging each other.<br> I know you're discussing<br> my personality<br> with George in Spanish.<br> No such a thing, never.<br> Don't tell me!<br> Spanish is the same<br> as Italian.<br> We're talking about<br> Mr. Dutch, the manager.<br> Shut up, man.<br> I don't know about you, Bruce.<br> You know<br> that goddamn tobacco you chew?<br> You ever hear of Old Yeller?<br> That's what they're<br> going to call your teeth.<br> And you have that, you know,<br> that hairdo you wear, man.<br> You ever seen that commercial<br> with the... what is it?...<br> Joe Namath or something,<br> about the greasy kid stuff?<br> You got to get hip<br> like them guys, man.<br> That's part of the, you know<br> the whole image<br> of a baseball player.<br> He has to look good.<br> Why don't you, like, you know<br> read some kind<br> of fashion magazine<br> something like "Esquire"?<br> You know, me and the other guys<br> we read "Esquire" and "Playboy"<br> and things like that...<br> that's why we dress well...<br> but you, man<br> you're reading farmer magazines<br> every time I

Hey, hey, hey!<br> Hold it, man.<br> Come on, come on,<br> come on, come on.<br> Hey.<br> Come on, man, shake it off.<br> Arthur, Joe, uh, tells me<br> you've been playing cards<br> with Pearson<br> over the winter, huh?<br> Sure. Why not?<br> When?<br> Just before camp begun.<br> Where?<br> Down at Bruce's.<br> Oh...<br> What were you doing<br> down there?<br> You mean besides<br> playing cards?<br> Quit stalling.<br> Why did you go there?<br> He always wanted me to see<br> what his folks were like<br> and all his old<br> stamping grounds<br> and, uh... various<br> beautiful whereabouts.<br> Oh... oh...<br> Was the missus with you?<br> Sure.<br> You drove down there by car?<br> Yes indeedy.<br> Very welly!<br> Now we got you and your wife<br> located by car in Georgia.<br> Let's back up the car<br> to where you spoke to Goose<br> on the telephone in Chicago.<br> You drove to Georgia<br> from New York<br> by via Chicago, did you?<br> I never did speak<br> to Goose in Chicago.<br> You never did?<br> In other words, you're<br> telling me Goose is a liar?<br> No, no, I suppose what he means<br> is I spoke to his missus.<br> You know very goddamn well<br> what he probably means.<br> Don't procrastinate, Arthur.<br> You're stalling the wrong man.<br> When was it?<br> Probably around in February.<br> What were you doing in Chicago?<br> Besides, uh,<br> speaking with Goose's missus?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Uh, I was only changing planes.<br> For where?<br> Minneapolis.<br> For what?<br> Insurance matters.<br> Name me somebody<br> you planned on seeing<br> on insurance matters<br> in Minneapolis.<br> Aleck Olson.<br> Joe!<br> Joe?<br> Yeah?<br> Where's that Aleck Olson from<br> in Boston<br> that swings like<br> an ax chopper?<br> Olson?<br> Yeah.<br> Olson?<br> Minneapolis.<br> You sell him any insurance?<br> It's only a matter of time.<br> This is all a lie.<br> I got Olson in the palm<br> of my hand.<br> I got a feeling that all your<br> little statements are true<br> but what they add<br> up to is one big lie.<br> Am I right?<br> About what?<br> About the feeling I got.<br> I don't know what kind<br> of feeling you got.<br> You say you got such<br> a feeling, I guess you do.<br> I wish you could be<br> wrapped in a sack<br> and threw in a river<br> all except<br> your pitching arm.<br> Hey Aleck,<br> can I see you, man?<br> Yeah, sure, sure can.<br> How's it going?<br> Hey, fellas, you know what<br> I think about fraternizing?<br> Ooh!<br> Dutch called you.<br> Yeah, what's<br> it all about?<br> What'd he say?<br> Oh, what'd you do<br> in Minneapolis.<br> I said, uh, "Bought a coat,<br> that's all I know."<br> Oh, he asked<br> about insurance<br> did I buy insurance<br> off you yet.<br> Is he selling insurance?<br> What else?<br> Uh, he asked me, "Then what?"<br> I said, uh, he got on the bus<br> to see Pearson.<br> That's all I remember.<br> Oh, what's up, Arthur?<br> You got a girl or something?<br> Did you tell him<br> where I went to see Pearson?<br> Well, I figured if you got<br> on a bus to Rochester<br> you're going to Rochester,<br> you know.<br> Ain't there any places<br> between Minneapolis<br> and Rochester?<br> Cannon Falls?<br> It just so happens<br> we met in Cannon Falls.<br> Well, listen, you can meet<br> anywhere you want to meet<br> except what would you be doing<br> in Cannon Falls?<br> Fishing.<br> In nine feet of ice?<br> Hunting?<br> Yeah, but you'd be most likely<br> go up north of the cities.<br> I mean,<br> that's where most people go.<br> You guys got girls<br> in Cannon Falls?<br> Arthur, concerning insurance,<br> I wanted to know...<br> No, no, no, no, no, no.<br> Up north's<br> exactly where I'd never go.<br> That's where everybody goes,<br> packed in like sardines.<br> Thanks, Aleck.<br> Yeah, for what?<br> I just wanted to talk to you<br> about insurance.<br> I mean, combining insurance<br> with annuity, you know?<br> Next time. I got to warm up.<br> Yeah, but I...<br> Jesus Christ,<br> every time I talk to that guy...<br> We started out near the top<br> running neck and neck<br> with Baltimore and Cincinnati<br> but all spring we kept floating<br> never dropping far back,<br> but never gaining, either<br> staying alive with pitching<br> one day and power the next<br> but never<br> putting the two together.<br> We weren't pulling like a club.<br> I was worried, but Dutch,<br> he was going out of his mind.<br> It's no surprise<br> he kept hounding me<br> trying every which way<br> to figure out<br> what was happening to the club.<br> Ain't you afraid you're going<br> to burn a hole in your chest?<br> I sit here,<br> reading the Chicago book<br> and I keep trying to figure<br> the son of a bitches out<br> but then you know what<br> I wind up thinking about?<br> Wiggen and Pearson.<br> Goddamn it, Arthur<br> you told me you went back<br> home from Minneapolis.<br> So, it's this again.<br> No, Dutch<br> I don't believe<br> I told you that.<br> But you lead me to believe it,<br> which is the same thing.<br> You see Olson?<br> Sure I seen Olson.<br> About what?<br> Insurance matters.<br> By the way...<br> he mentioned you called him.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Dutch, I wish you wouldn't<br> push this thing too far.<br> Why not?<br> It's a personal matter.<br> Flip up the bowl.<br> How so?<br> Well...<br> you're probably<br> going to think<br> I'm some kind of heel<br> and all that<br> but there's<br> this airline stewardess...<br> Her name being what?<br> Mary.<br> Mary what?<br> Smith, Jones, Brown?<br> Mary Pistologlioni.<br> Go on.<br> I'm trying very hard<br> to believe this.<br> So, you pitter round<br> between Chicago and Minneapolis<br> and then you get on a bus in<br> Minneapolis and you go where?<br> Well, didn't Olson tell you?<br> You tell me.<br> Cannon Falls, Minnesota.<br> For what?<br> To hunt.<br> You never hunt.<br> I'm taking it up.<br> What kind of a gun do you shoot?<br> No kind.<br> I only went there<br> 'cause Pearson asked me to.<br> What'd you catch?<br> Nothing.<br> You know, we changed our minds<br> and went back.<br> Back where?<br> Back home.<br> Him to Georgia<br> and me to New York.<br> You're probably driveling<br> up to the eyes by now<br> but I'm going to hear<br> other sounds from him anyway.<br> Bradley!<br> Send Pearson in.<br> I don't believe<br> this cockeyed bull story<br> about Mary Pistolcoloni<br> for one minute, but if it's true<br> you're making<br> a very big mistake.<br> Anybody with<br> a wife like yours<br> should count his blessings.<br> What plane did you go up<br> to Minnesota in, Pearson?<br> Um, no plane, sir.<br> In my car.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Is, uh, Cannon Falls<br> a nice town?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Well, tell me, what is it like?<br> Well, it's a pretty nice<br> little town<br> with a main drag<br> and a few stores, but very cold.<br> Oh.<br> Yeah, we couldn't fish.<br> The ice was nine feet thick.<br> Mm-hmm?<br> So we went hunting.<br> What'd you shoot?<br> Uh... nothing.<br> No, we start hunting<br> but then we changed my mind.<br> So, uh... 'cause I didn't feel<br> like killing anything anymore.<br> Hmm.<br> Well, that knocks<br> the hell out of hunting.<br> Yeah, sir.<br> I guess it does.<br> Then where did you go<br> from Minnesota?<br> Uh, back home.<br> Alone?<br> Yeah.<br> You sure?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Weren't we, Arthur?<br> Weren't we who?<br> Me and Arthur.<br> You two went down<br> from Minnesota by car?<br> Yeah.<br> Flip up the bowl again.<br> Very well, Arthur.<br> I think we might<br> be heading<br> toward something at last<br> for two days ago,<br> I asked you<br> who drove your car<br> down to Bainbridge<br> and you said you<br> and your wife did<br> but now I hear<br> something else again.<br> Did you go down there<br> and back home for your wife<br> or did her and Mary Pistolcoloni<br> maybe drive down<br> with Aleck Olson<br> or in other words,<br> what the hell is going on here?<br> Because you know<br> as sure as your name is<br> that I'm going to get<br> to the bottom<br> of this.<br> Well, Dutch, the joke's on you.<br> I'm laughing my ass off.<br> Because if you'll<br> back the whole thing up<br> you'll remember I called you<br> during this time<br> on the telephone<br> and give you<br> a little patter, right?<br> And I told you I was up home<br> when all the time, where we were<br> we were right downtown St. Louis<br> and we would've went<br> out and seen you<br> but we weren't dressed<br> and, uh, we didn't want<br> to see the missus like that.<br> So, we made a gag<br> out of the whole thing.<br> Well, you can understand me<br> not wanting to give away<br> a gag like that<br> I might want to use it<br> on somebody else<br> at another time.<br> Get out.<br> Get out!<br> Strike two, two, two,<br> two, two, two, two!<br> Come on, let's go, Pearson!<br> Come on, baby, let's go!<br> Hit it! Hit it!<br> Back to first!<br> Back to first!<br> Back! Back!<br> Bring it back!<br> Attaboy, Pearson!<br> Yeah, attaboy, Bruce!<br> Not bad, huh, Dutch?<br> Nah, not bad.<br> Arthur... how do I change<br> my beneficiary?<br> Who do you want to change it to?<br> To Katie.<br> She's going to marry me at last.<br> When?<br> When you change<br> your beneficiary?<br> Arthur, you got no right<br> telling me who I can<br> and who I cannot change<br> my beneficiary to.<br> Why didn't she marry you<br> last year or the year before?<br> Well, she never<br> loved me before.<br> Before what?<br> Before now.<br> How is now<br> different?<br> Arthur, will you<br> change it for me<br> or will you not<br> change it for me?<br> I'll write away to Arcturis.<br> Well, when?<br> Tuesday.<br> Well, why not now?<br> Because it's time<br> to go the ballpark.<br> Oh, I seen you dash off<br> many a letter<br> standing against the wall<br> or when you was in a cab.<br> This is a matter<br> of $137,500.<br> Now, a large figure<br> like that<br> has got to be handled<br> sitting down<br> with plenty of time<br> to whet your pencil.<br> Well... okay, but don't forget,<br> and do it Tuesday, huh?<br> Hey, Arthur, come here.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> How are you, Tootsie?<br> Pretty good.<br> I want<br> to ask you something.<br> Why can't you Mammoths get it<br> together, for heaven's sake?<br> What's with the squabbling?<br> You know, considering the<br> personnel of the organization<br> you'd be on top of it<br> if you guys hung together.<br> What do you guys do on the road,<br> anyway?<br> I think that's what's wrong.<br> Oh, I'm sorry; this hotel does<br> not provide such a service.<br> I'm sorry.<br> And I wish somebody'd tell Dutch<br> to bolster up the catching.<br> You know, I'm going to tell him<br> myself if I see him?<br> You do that, Tootsie.<br> Quick, Arthur,<br> help me, for God's sake.<br> This place is full of fish.<br> Yeah? I'll get Bruce.<br> Let him sleep; it's tegwar.<br> He wants to join us.<br> Let him sleep;<br> the two of us are enough.<br> Then let him sit in for me.<br> He can't do it.<br> Don't you understand that?<br> I promised him, Joe,<br> and you promised me in Florida!<br> Shh!

I<br> don't know which is which.<br> Oh, Joe, how's the show?<br> I will make you sorry<br> for this, Arthur.<br> I really will.<br> You're going to pay for this,<br> Arthur!<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Nothing.<br> What are you reading?<br> Well, you ain't going<br> to believe this<br> but I'm reading how some girl<br> said she was seduced by Dracula.<br> Boys...<br> today, we start shaking the son<br> of a bitches off for good, hmm?<br> You know...<br> To me, they're like a...<br> a buzzing fly."<br> "To me, they're like<br> ...a buzzing fly,<br> buzzing around your head<br> while you sit<br> and watch it for a while<br> without raising your hand,<br> against it... like this.<br> Si? Ah...<br> Go ahead,<br> you Baltimore fly.<br> Buzz me one more time<br> and I will snatch you<br> out of the air<br> and you will buzz me no more.<br> Diego...<br> Diego!<br> Forget it, huh?<br> This isn't so much<br> for George, anyhow<br> as, uh... certain other people<br> who can't control their feelings<br> toward their teammates.<br> Rule one: No dissension.<br> - Baltimore...<br> - Baltimore...<br> ...enough is enough.<br> I should've pulled<br> away from you by now<br> and now I think I will<br> simply pull myself together<br> and squash out<br> your miserable life.<br> Fly, you are done for.<br> Whack!<br> But only one thing is wrong.<br> I look down on my hand,<br> and I see no fly<br> and I ask myself,<br> "How could I have missed it<br> "when I already seen the whole<br> league around, east and west<br> and I know that I am the winner<br> if I work together?"<br> Diego, forget it, huh?<br> - Forget?<br> - Yeah.<br> What is "forget"?<br> Ah! "Forget"<br> is not to remember.<br> But, mister, it's too<br> quick not to remember.<br> She's just now...<br> boom... happened, no?<br> "Forget it" means "screw it."<br> Why did I lose<br> when I should have won?<br> Because the fly flew<br> through my fingers<br> and the reason that the fly flew<br> through my fingers was<br> because the fingers<br> did not work together.<br> The first finger's saying<br> to the second finger<br> "I don't like you because<br> you won't play cards with me"<br> and the second finger says<br> to the third finger<br> "You should hear<br> what finger number one<br> has been saying about you"<br> and the third finger says<br> to the fourth finger<br> "I don't agree<br> with the color of your skin"<br> and the fourth finger says<br> to the fifth finger<br> "Let's you and me cut finger<br> number three down, then<br> "and tell our goddamn wives<br> to do the same<br> and bring up our children<br> likewise."<br> Boys, boys!
