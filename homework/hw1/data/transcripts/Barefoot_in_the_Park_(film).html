We meet once<br> every five years<br> for a dinner<br> we cook ourselves.<br> In 1987, they're<br> supposed to come to my house.<br> We have another<br> 30 seconds.<br> Till what?<br> Until they're<br> edible.<br> The last 15 seconds,<br> we just let them<br> sit there and breathe.<br> Oh, Paul,<br> aren't they gorgeous?<br> Yeah.<br> When you eat knichi,<br> you take a bite<br> into history.<br> Knichi is over<br> 2,000 years old.<br> Not this particular batch,<br> of course. Ha ha.<br> Ha ha ha ha...<br> Ha ha ha.<br> Would you be betraying the society<br> by telling us what's in them?<br> Well, if caught,<br> your taste buds<br> are ostracized for two years.<br> But since I'm<br> among friends...<br> It's bits<br> of salted fish,<br> grated olives,<br> spices,<br> and onion batter.<br> Ready?<br> 5...<br> 4...<br> 3...<br> 2...<br> 1... 0.

Thank you.<br> Are you O.K.?<br> I think I popped it<br> back too far.<br> Was that water?<br> No. Vodka. I use it<br> in the knichi.<br> Oh, my stomach.<br> Of course, the trick<br> is to pop it<br> right through the center<br> of the tongue.<br> Then it gets the benefit<br> of the entire palate. Corie.<br> Well... here goes.<br> How about that?<br> Perfect! You are the prettiest epicurean<br> I've ever seen.<br> Paul.<br> No. No, thank you.<br> L... I have a bad arm.<br> You can try.

Sorry, I forgot.<br> We're having<br> a heat wave.<br> Do you have a dime?<br> Yeah.<br> Would you look<br> at her?<br> Look at her.<br> She's freezing to death,<br> but she wouldn't admit that.<br> I'll admit it.<br> I'm freezing to death.<br> Ah!

He put his hand in<br> to take out the fly.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Ooh! How's my head<br> going to feel tomorrow?<br> Wonderful!<br> No headache?<br> No, but<br> you won't be able<br> to make a fist<br> for three days.<br> Hey!<br> Look at that!<br> Coffee. We promised<br> to make coffee.<br> Oh! And a promise<br> is a promise!<br> I forgot the stove<br> doesn't work.<br> Hey, upstairs,<br> everybody, for coffee.<br> Don't you two<br> want coffee?<br> Oh, they'll drink it<br> if we make it.<br> Don't you two go away.<br> Shama shama el mal kema ma.<br> I feel like<br> we've died...<br> and gone to heaven...<br> only we had<br> to climb up.<br> Struck down<br> in the prime of life.<br> It isn't exactly<br> that I feel sick, just...<br> kind of numb...<br> and I can't<br> make a fist.<br> Mom, you want to hear<br> something frightening?<br> My teeth feel soft.<br> Huh. It's funny.<br> The best thing we had all night<br> was the knichi.<br> Ohh... anyway, Corie<br> had a good time.<br> She seems to get<br> such a terrific kick out of living.<br> You've got to admire that,<br> don't you, Paul?<br> Yes, yes.<br> I admire anybody<br> who has three portions<br> of pelenchki.<br> I tried, Paul.<br> I just couldn't seem<br> to work up an appetite<br> the way they did.<br> No, you mustn't blame<br> yourself, Mom.<br> We're not used<br> to that kind of food, that's all.<br> You don't...<br> pick up a fork<br> and dig<br> into a black salad.<br> You got to play<br> with it.<br> I don't think I could get through<br> coffee tonight.<br> I'm all out<br> of pink pills.<br> Where you going?<br> Home. I'd like to die<br> in my own bed.<br> What will I<br> tell them?<br> Make up some<br> clever little lie.<br> Tell Corie I'm not<br> really her mother.<br> We've decided to have<br> flaming brandy.<br> I'm afraid you must<br> excuse me, darling,<br> but it is<br> a little late.<br> You can't go.<br> It's early.<br> I know, but I have a 10:00<br> dentist appointment at 9:00,<br> and it's been<br> a very long evening,<br> and I don't know<br> what I'm saying.<br> You can't do that.<br> Darling.<br> Good night, Paul.<br> Good night,<br> Mr. Velasco.<br> Good night,<br> Paul.<br> Good night.<br> Good night,<br> Corie.<br> You're not<br> going, too?<br> Certainly. I'm driving<br> Mrs. Banks home.<br> Oh, no. I mean,<br> it's too late.<br> For what?<br> The buses stop at 2:00.<br> How would you get home?<br> Why worry about that?<br> I'll meet that problem in New Jersey.<br> Really, Mr. Velasco,<br> it's very sweet...<br> Victor.<br> What?<br> If we're spending<br> the rest of the evening together,<br> it must be Victor. And I insist<br> the arrangement be reciprocal.<br> What is it?<br> What<br> is what?<br> Your name,<br> Mother.<br> It's Ethel.<br> Oh, yes. Ethel, that's right.<br> My name is Ethel.<br> That's better.<br> Are you ready... Ethel?<br> If you insist...<br> Walter.<br> Victor. It's Victor.<br> Yes, Victor.<br> Good night, Paul.<br> Shama shama, Corie.<br> Shama shama.<br> If you don't hear<br> from us in a week,<br> we'll be at the Nacional Hotel<br> in Mexico City...<br> Room 703.<br> Come on, Ethel.<br> What did he mean<br> by that?<br> Stop worrying, Mother.<br> Call me in the morning.<br> Oh...<br> How about that?<br> He likes her!<br> He likes my mother!<br> He'll probably<br> have to sleep over.<br> Paul, do you<br> suppose that...<br> Not my mother.<br> Boy, what a night!<br> I got an idea. Let's take the bottle<br> of Scotch downstairs<br> and ring all the bells<br> and yell "police. "<br> Huh? Just to see who comes out<br> of whose apartment?<br> What's the matter, darling?<br> Don't you feel well?<br> What a rotten<br> thing to do,<br> dragging your mother out like that<br> into the middle of the harbor<br> for a bowl<br> of sheep dip.<br> It was Greek bean soup.<br> And at least<br> she tasted it.<br> She didn't jab at it<br> with her knife<br> throwing cute<br> little epigrams like,<br> "Ho, ho, ho. I think<br> there's somebody in there. "<br> That's, um... quite<br> a match you made.<br> I can just hear the conversation.<br> Sparkling dialogue.<br> He's telling her about some great<br> Japanese restaurant<br> in East Berlin,<br> and she's describing<br> the joys of having<br> a root canal job.<br> Give me your<br> hand, Ethel.<br> My what?<br> Your hand. There is ice<br> on the stoop.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I can manage.<br> Ohhh!<br> Ethel.<br> Are you all right?<br> Uhhh...<br> Ohhh...<br> Well.<br> I just can't<br> understand<br> how you can be so unconcerned<br> about all this.<br> - Unconcerned?<br> - I really...<br> Do you think<br> I'll get one wink of sleep<br> until that phone<br> rings tomorrow?<br> I'm scared to death<br> for my mother.<br> And I'm grateful there's finally<br> something to be scared about.<br> What I'm really<br> concerned about is you.<br> Me?<br> Me?<br> Yeah. I'm beginning<br> to wonder<br> if you're capable<br> of having a good time.<br> Why? Because I like<br> to wear my gloves in winter?<br> No. Because there isn't the least bit<br> of adventure in you.<br> You know what you are, Paul?<br> You're a watcher.<br> You're a watcher.<br> There are watchers in this world,<br> and there are doers.<br> And the watchers<br> sit around watching the doers do.<br> Tonight you watched,<br> and I did.<br> It was a little harder<br> to watch what you did<br> than it was for you to do<br> what I was watching.<br> You can't even relax<br> for one evening.<br> I don't know, Paul,<br> sometimes you act like a...<br> What? Hmm? A stuffed shirt?<br> Is that it?<br> I didn't say that.<br> That's what you<br> were implying.<br> That's what<br> you're anticipating.<br> I didn't say<br> stuffed shirt.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> But you're extremely<br> proper and dignified.<br> Proper and dignified?<br> When was I proper and dignified?<br> The other night at Delfino's,<br> you were drunk, right?<br> Right.<br> I was stoned.<br> Exactly. I didn't<br> even know it<br> until you told me<br> in the morning.<br> Uhh... I mean, you're a funny kind<br> of drunk, Paul.<br> You just sat around looking unhappy,<br> watching your coat.<br> I was watching<br> my coat<br> because I saw someone else<br> watching my coat.<br> If you want, I'll get drunk<br> for you sometime,<br> make your hair<br> stand on end.<br> In Harry's Bar last New Year's Eve,<br> I punched an old woman.<br> Don't tell me<br> about drunk.<br> When else? When else<br> was I proper and dignified?<br> All the time.<br> You're always<br> dressed right.<br> You always look right.<br> You always say<br> the right thing.<br> You're very nearly<br> perfect.<br> That's a rotten<br> thing to say.<br> Before we were married,<br> I thought you slept with a tie.<br> Just for formal sleeps.<br> You have absolutely no sense<br> of the ridiculous.<br> Like last<br> Thursday night,<br> you wouldn't walk barefoot with me in<br> Washington Square Park.<br> Why not?<br> Simple answer.<br> It was 17 degrees.<br> Exactly. It's very logical,<br> it's very sensible,<br> and it's no fun.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Maybe I am<br> a little bit too proper<br> and dignified for you.<br> Maybe you would've<br> been happier<br> with somebody a little more colorful and<br> flamboyant... like the geek.<br> It'd be a lot more laughs than<br> a stuffed shirt.<br> You said I wasn't.<br> Well, you are now.<br> I'm not listening<br> to this.<br> I have a court case<br> in the morning.<br> Where are you going?<br> To sleep.<br> How can you now?<br> I'll close my eyes<br> and count knichis. Good night.<br> You cannot sleep now.<br> We're having a fight.<br> You have the fight. When you're<br> through, turn off these lights.<br> That gets me<br> absolutely insane!<br> You can even control<br> your emotions!<br> No, no. I'm just as upset<br> as you are.<br> But when I'm hungry, I eat.<br> When I'm tired, I sleep.<br> I've seen you<br> eat and sleep.<br> Not in midcrisis.<br> What crisis?<br> We're just yelling.<br> You don't consider<br> this a crisis!<br> Our whole marriage<br> is hanging in the balance.<br> It is?<br> When did this happen?<br> Just now. It's suddenly become<br> very clear to me<br> that you and I have<br> absolutely nothing in common.<br> Because I won't<br> go walking barefoot in the park?<br> No case. Adultery, yes,<br> but cold feet, no.<br> Don't you oversimplify this.<br> I am angry. Can't you see that?<br> It's 2:15. If I can get to sleep<br> in half an hour,<br> I'll get<br> about 5 hours sleep.<br> I'll call you from court tomorrow,<br> and we'll fight by phone.<br> You won't go to sleep!<br> You'll stay here<br> and fight to save our marriage!<br> If our marriage hinges<br> on those fishbowls and pelmenchki,<br> it's not worth saving.<br> Care to join me in our tiny bed?<br> We're sleeping from left<br> to right tonight.<br> You won't discuss it!<br> You're afraid to discuss it!<br> I married a...<br> a coward!<br> Would you bring in a pail?<br> The closet's dripping.<br> Oh, I hate you!<br> I really,<br> really hate you!<br> There's one thing<br> I've learned in court.<br> Be careful when<br> you're tired and angry.<br> You may say something<br> you'll regret.<br> I am now tired and angry.<br> And a coward!<br> Maybe you're right.<br> Maybe we don't have<br> anything in common.<br> Two people<br> should have more<br> than just<br> a blood test first.<br> Maybe they should<br> be checked first<br> for a little common sense,<br> understanding,<br> and emotional maturity!<br> All right. Why don't<br> you get it passed<br> by the Supreme Court?<br> Only those couples bearing a certificate<br> from their psychiatrist<br> proving that they're<br> emotionally mature can be married.<br> Oh, listen...<br> Don't touch me!<br> Don't lay<br> a finger on me!<br> I can't stand<br> to have you near me!<br> I don't want to be<br> in the same room with you!<br> You're hysterical.<br> I am not hysterical!<br> I know exactly<br> what I'm saying.<br> It's all over<br> between us.<br> It's never going<br> to be any good anymore.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't want to cry.<br> Cry, please. Go ahead.<br> Don't tell me<br> when to cry!<br> I'll cry when<br> I feel like crying.<br> I won't cry until you're<br> out of this apartment.<br> What do you mean?<br> You certainly don't think we're<br> going to live here anymore, do you?<br> After this?<br> Are you serious?<br> Of course<br> I'm serious, Paul!<br> I want a divorce!<br> Divorce!<br> I'm sorry.<br> I can't discuss it anymore.<br> Where are you going?<br> To bed.<br> You can't, not now.<br> You did before.<br> During a fight.<br> This is during<br> a divorce.<br> I can't talk to you when<br> you're hysterical.<br> I want to know why<br> you want a divorce.<br> Huh?<br> Why?<br> Because you and I have absolutely<br> nothing in common.<br> Nothing in common?<br> What about the six days<br> at the Plaza, Corie?<br> Six days does<br> not a week make.<br> What does that mean?<br> I don't know!<br> I don't know<br> what it means.<br> All I know is<br> that I want a divorce.<br> You know,<br> I think you mean it.<br> You mean this?<br> I do.<br> I really do.<br> Let's just...<br> think.<br> I thought you<br> weren't going to cry.<br> Well, I am!<br> I'm going to have<br> the biggest cry<br> I've ever had<br> in my whole life,<br> and I'm going<br> to enjoy it!<br> I'll cry so hard<br> I'll keep you<br> awake all night.<br> Good night, Paul.<br> I mean goodbye.<br> Six days does<br> not a week make.<br> It's for you. I don't<br> live here anymore.<br> Fine. Fine.<br> You work and work<br> for a lousy 6 cents.<br> I don't even care.<br> I don't know...<br> why I even bother.<br> It's just...<br> it's just nothing.<br> One pound of grapes.<br> Anything else?<br> No, thank you.<br> Ah-choo!<br> God bless him.<br> If that's for tonight,<br> you needn't bother.<br> I have my own dinner.<br> I thought you<br> were moving out.<br> I haven't had a chance<br> to look for a room yet.<br> I work during the day.<br> You'll look tonight.<br> I'm coming down<br> with a cold.<br> That's why<br> I'm home early.<br> I thought I'd take aspirins and get<br> right into the sofa.<br> I'm sure you<br> can find someplace.<br> You can stay<br> at your club.<br> It's not that kind<br> of a club.<br> It's a locker room<br> and a handball court.<br> To sleep over, I'd have<br> to keep winning the serve.<br> Hello, Mrs. Bratter,<br> Mr. Bratter.<br> How's every<br> little thing?<br> The little things<br> are fine.<br> Shall I charge it,<br> Mr. Bratter?<br> Charge it to Mrs. Bratter.<br> It's a new account.<br> The grapes are his.<br> It's open!<br> Hi.<br> Hello again.<br> Phone's out<br> of order.<br> Yeah. I know.<br> I wouldn't be up here<br> on a social call.<br> Hey, you did<br> a real nice job.<br> Thank you.<br> Know anybody that<br> might want to rent it?<br> Rent it?<br> You moving already?<br> I'm looking<br> for a smaller place.<br> Smaller than this,<br> they're not easy to find.<br> How do you<br> like married life?<br> Very interesting.<br> Hello.<br> I'm the<br> telephone man.<br> I'm the husband.<br> Well, let's see what's<br> wrong with the phone.<br> It's dead.<br> I know. It was<br> murdered last night.<br> I'll be out of here<br> as fast as I can.<br> Take your time.<br> Nobody's rushing you.<br> Is there any beer<br> in the house?<br> I said, "Is there any beer<br> in the house?"<br> Would you<br> like me to look?<br> There's no beer<br> in the house.<br> There is no beer.<br> Ah!<br> That's my trouble... beer.<br> I can drink 10 cans<br> in a night... of beer.<br> Ahh!<br> My laundry come back today?<br> Yes, your laundry<br> came back today.<br> They stuffed your shirts<br> beautifully.<br> Would you<br> like a drink?<br> I said, "Would you<br> like a drink?"<br> Who? Me?<br> Yeah.<br> No.<br> Right.<br> Just one more little screw<br> will do it.<br> There. I'm finished.<br> I'm finished.<br> Aah!<br> Hello. Yes, it is.<br> Just a moment.<br> It's Aunt Harriet.<br> I don't have<br> an Aunt Harriet.<br> I guess you won't<br> be needing me anymore.<br> Goodbye.<br> Aunt Harriet,<br> can you hang on a second?<br> When do I get it?<br> Get what?<br> When do I get my divorce?<br> I don't know.<br> They didn't send<br> the marriage license yet.<br> I want you out tonight.<br> Fine.<br> I'll get my bag.<br> I'll pack<br> my wet suits.<br> Hi, Aunt Harriet.<br> What's wrong?<br> I'll go sleep<br> in the park,<br> where it's<br> dry and warm.<br> No, Mother's not with me.<br> She left about<br> 2:00 this morning.<br> Yeah? What happened?<br> What?<br> Mother?<br> My mother?<br> Are you sure?<br> What's the matter?<br> What happened?<br> No. My phone's been<br> out of order all day.<br> Don't get excited.<br> I'll call you back<br> as soon as I find out<br> anything. Goodbye.<br> What's wrong<br> with your mother?<br> Mother didn't<br> come home last night.<br> Her bed hasn't<br> been slept in.<br> I'm calling the police.<br> Take it easy.<br> There's nothing to be...<br> Maybe her back<br> was bothering her,<br> and she fell asleep<br> on the ironing board.<br> Would you just go away.<br> Just go away.<br> Where are you going?<br> Upstairs to find out<br> what happened to mother.<br> You better not come back.<br> I'm buying<br> a big dog tomorrow.<br> You'll have somebody<br> to walk barefoot in the park with.<br> A dog. That's a laugh.<br> When she tries<br> to take him for a walk,<br> he'll get one look<br> at those stairs<br> and go right<br> for her throat.<br> Mr. Velasco, can I see you<br> for a minute?<br> A little dog.<br> A little doggie.<br> I don't need anybody<br> to protect me, sweetheart,<br> because I am a man,<br> independent, mature,<br> self-sufficient<br> man... ah-choo!<br> Oh! God bless me.<br> I've probably got the flu.<br> Yeah.<br> Chills, fever, sweaty.<br> Probably have<br> a 24-hour virus.<br> Better tomorrow<br> at a quarter to 4:00.<br> Oh!<br> Thanks. Thanks a lot, pal.<br> And thus it was written.<br> Some shall die<br> by pestilence,<br> some by the plague,<br> and one poor schnook<br> will get it from a hole<br> in the ceiling.<br> Ahh!<br> That's it. That's it.<br> Goodbye, leaky closet.<br> Bye, no bathtub.<br> Bye, hole.<br> Goodbye, six flights.<br> Oh!<br> Goodbye,<br> Corie.<br> Oh, no goodbye?<br> According to law,<br> I'm entitled to...<br> Goodbye!<br> What?<br> Is it your mother?<br> Corie, what is it,<br> an accident?<br> For Pete's sake,<br> what's it about?<br> It's not the way<br> it looks at all!<br> Boo-hoo!<br> Good God.<br> Corie, you've<br> got to believe me.<br> Somebody believe me.<br> I warned her.<br> I warned her,<br> and I was right.<br> He warned me,<br> and he was right.<br> It must have<br> been the drinks.<br> I had a great deal<br> to drink last night...<br> Martinis, vodka, coffee,<br> black bean soup, and ouzos.<br> That's not<br> my problem.<br> I'm well<br> out of it now.<br> Ahh!<br> Then after I fell,<br> Victor picked me up<br> and carried me inside.<br> I couldn't walk because<br> my shoes fell down the sewer.<br> You don't have<br> to explain.<br> He started<br> to carry me here,<br> but his hat<br> fell over his eyes,<br> and we fell down the stairs<br> into apartment 3C.<br> I fell on his foot.<br> I thought we'd<br> have a nice evening.<br> Mr. Gonzales, Mr. Armandariz,<br> and Mr. Calhoun<br> carried us both<br> up there<br> and put us down<br> on the rugs.<br> When I awoke,<br> Victor was gone,<br> and I was there<br> in his bathrobe.<br> I swear that's<br> the truth, Corie!<br> Got a cold.<br> I've had one<br> for 20 years.<br> Ahh!<br> Gee, that's a nice coat<br> you got there.<br> What?<br> Huh?<br> Your coat.<br> I'll make you a trade.<br> What have you got?<br> Nothing.<br> It's a deal!<br> You must believe me.<br> I've told you everything.<br> Then where<br> are your clothes?<br> That I can't tell you.<br> Why not?<br> You won't believe me.<br> I will. Mother,<br> where are your clothes?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't believe you.<br> Didn't I tell you<br> you wouldn't believe me?<br> I don't know<br> where they are.<br> I've never<br> been so humiliated.<br> I kept having<br> the most horrible nightmares.<br> I kept dreaming<br> my fingers were falling off<br> because I couldn't<br> make a fist.
