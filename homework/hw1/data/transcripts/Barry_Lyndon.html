                        Gentlemen, cock your pistols.<br> Barry's father had been bred,<br> like many sons of genteel families...<br> ...to the profession of the law.<br> There is no doubt he would've made<br> an eminent figure in his profession...<br> ...had he not been killed in a duel...<br> ...which arose over the purchase<br> of some horses.<br> Barry's mother,<br> after her husband's death...<br> ...lived in such a way<br> as to defy slander.<br> Many a man who had been charmed<br> by the spinster...<br> ...renewed his offers to the widow.<br> But she refused all proposals<br> of marriage...<br> ...declaring that she lived<br> only for her son...<br> ...and the memory of her departed saint.<br> First love! What a change<br> it makes in a lad.<br> What a magnificent secret it is<br> he carries with him!<br> The tender passion gushes out<br> of a man's heart.<br> He loves as a bird sings...<br> ...or a rose blows from nature.<br> Killarney.<br> Now, what shall it be?<br> Turn around and face the wall.<br> The object of Barry's attention, and...<br> ...the cause of his early troubles...<br> ...was his cousin,<br> Nora Brady by name.<br> I have hidden my neck ribbon<br> somewhere on my person.<br> If you find it, you can have it.<br> You are free to look anywhere for it.<br> I will think little of you<br> if you do not find it.<br> I cannot find it.<br> You haven't looked properly.<br> I cannot find it.<br> I'll give you a hint.<br> I feel the ribbon.<br> Why are you trembling?<br> At the pleasure of finding the ribbon.<br> Liar.<br> About this time the United Kingdom<br> was greatly excited...<br> ...by the threat...<br> ...of a French invasion.<br> The noblemen and people of condition...<br> ...loyally raised regiments...<br> ...to resist the invaders.<br> Their scarlet coats and swaggering airs<br> filled Barry with envy.<br> Brady Town sent a company to join...<br> ...the Kilwangen Regiment<br> of which John Quin was the Captain.<br> The whole country was alive<br> with war's alarums...<br> ...the kingdoms ringing<br> with military music.<br> Redmond, what is the matter?<br> Were you obliged to dance<br> five times with Captain Quin?<br> I don't care a fig for Captain Quin.<br> He dances prettily,<br> and is a pleasant rattle of a man.<br> He looks well in his regimentals.<br> He asked me to dance.<br> How could I refuse him?<br> But you refused me.<br> I can dance with you any day.<br> To dance with my cousin looks as though<br> I could find no other partner.<br> Besides, Captain Quin is a man.<br> You're only a boy and penniless.<br> If I meet him again,<br> you will find out who is the best man.<br> I'll fight him Captain as he is.<br> Oh, don't be so silly!<br> I mean it.<br> But Captain Quin is known<br> as a valiant soldier.<br> It is mighty well of you<br> to fight yokels...<br> ...but to fight an Englishman<br> is a different matter.<br> You best have him take you home.<br> Redmond!<br> Barry resolved never to see Nora again.<br> But such resolutions,<br> steadfastly held for a whole week...<br> ...are abandoned<br> in a few moments of despair.<br> No, Nora, no, except for you<br> and four others...<br> ...I vow before all the gods my heart...<br> ...has never felt the soft flame.<br> Ah, you men, you men, John...<br> ...your passion's not equal to ours.<br> We are like some plant I've read of.<br> We bear but one flower and then we die.<br> You, you, you mean you...<br> ...never felt an inclination for another?<br> Never, my John.<br> How can you ask such a question?<br> Oh, darling Norelia!<br> Nora was chaperoned by her brothers<br> Mick and Ulick...<br> ...whose interests would be affected...<br> ...by the favorable outcome<br> of her affair with Quin.<br> Redmond, how nice to see you.<br> Redmond!<br> How could you do this to me?<br> Redmond, what's the matter?<br> What are you saying?<br> I think this might be the moment<br> to return something to you.<br> Thank you, Redmond.<br> I must have forgotten it.<br> Yes, you did.<br> Captain Quin, may I introduce<br> my cousin, Redmond Barry.<br> Miss Brady, it would appear...<br> ...you both have something<br> private to discuss.<br> It would be best for me to withdraw.<br> Captain Quin, I have nothing private<br> to discuss with my cousin.<br> Miss Brady, it appears you have<br> a great deal to discuss.<br> Captain Quin, he don't signify any more<br> than my parrot or lapdog.<br> Indeed!<br> Are you in the habit of giving...<br> ...intimate articles of your clothing<br> to your parrot or lapdog?<br> Mayn't I give a bit of ribbon<br> to my own cousin?<br> You're welcome, miss.<br> As many yards as you like.<br> When ladies make presents to gentlemen,<br> it's time for other gentlemen to retire.<br> I wish you both a good day.<br> Jack Quin!<br> What's the matter?<br> I'll tell you, sir.<br> I've had enough of Miss Brady<br> and your Irish ways.<br> What is it?<br> We'll accustom you to Irish ways,<br> or we'll adopt English ones.<br> It is not the English way<br> for ladies to have two lovers.<br> And so, I'll thank you to pay me<br> the sum you owe me.<br> And I resign all claims<br> to this young lady.<br> If she fancies schoolboys,<br> let her take 'em, sir.<br> You're joking!<br> I never was more earnest.<br> John, wait.<br> Meddling brat!<br> Your hand is in everybody's pie!<br> What business have you to quarrel<br> with a gentleman of substance?<br> Redmond, me boy, take a seat.<br> Mrs. Brady and ladies, if you please.<br> This sort of toast is drunk<br> too seldom in my family...<br> ...and you'll please to receive it<br> with all honors.<br> Here's to Captain and Mrs. John Quin<br> and a long life to them.<br> Kiss her, Jack,<br> for faith you've got a treasure.<br> Come on, Jack.<br> There's the man!<br> A long and happy life together.<br> A long and happy life together.<br> Thank you.<br> Redmond!<br> Here's my toast to you,<br> Captain John Quin.<br> Redmond, how dare you behave like that<br> in my house!<br> Mrs. Brady, take the children out.<br> My dear fellow, are you all right?<br> In heaven's name,<br> what does all the row mean?<br> The fact is, sir...<br> ...the young monkey's in love with Nora.<br> He found her and the Captain<br> in the garden today.<br> Now he's for murdering Jack Quin.<br> Mr. Brady, I've been insulted grossly<br> in this house.<br> I'm not satisfied<br> with these ways of going on.<br> I'm an Englishman!<br> And a man of property!<br> And this impudent young swine...<br> ...should be horsewhipped!<br> Mr. Quin can have satisfaction<br> any time he pleases...<br> ...by calling on Redmond Barry,<br> Esquire of Barryville.<br> I'll see the boy home.<br> A pretty day's work, Master Redmond.<br> Knowing your uncle is distressed<br> for money...<br> ...trying to break off a match which<br> will bring 1,500 a year into the family...<br> Quin has promised to pay off the 4,000<br> which is bothering your uncle.<br> He takes a girl without a penny...<br> ...a girl that's flinging herself<br> at the head of every man in these parts.<br> And missing them all!<br> And you, who ought to be attached<br> to your uncle as to your father...<br> I am.<br> And this is the return<br> you make for his kindness?<br> Didn't he harbor you<br> when your father died?<br> Hasn't he given you and your mother<br> a fine house, rent free?<br> Mark this, and come what will of it...<br> ...I will fight the man who pretends<br> the hand of Nora Brady.<br> I'll follow him if it's into the church<br> and fight him there.<br> I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.<br> Faith, and I believe ye!<br> I never saw a lad more game in me life.<br> Give me a kiss, me boy.<br> You're after me own soul.<br> As long as I live, you shall never want<br> a friend or a second.<br> Will you take my message to him?<br> And arrange a meeting?<br> Well, if it must be, it must.<br> Look here, Redmond, me boy,<br> this is a silly business.<br> The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.<br> And as sure as she does,<br> you'll forget her.<br> You're but a boy and Quin is willing<br> to consider you as such.<br> Right, Quin?<br> Yes.<br> Now, Dublin's a fine place.<br> If you've a mind to ride there<br> and see the town for a month...<br> ...here's ten guineas at your service.<br> Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?<br> Yes, if Mr. Barry will apologize<br> and go to Dublin...<br> ...I will consider the whole affair<br> honorably settled.<br> Say you're sorry, Redmond.<br> You can easily say that.<br> I'm not sorry.<br> And I'll not apologize.<br> And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell.<br> Then there's nothing else for it.<br> God bless you.<br> This isn't my pistol.<br> It's all right, it's one of mine.<br> Yours will serve, if it's needed,<br> for the next round.<br> Good luck, Redmond.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...cock your pistols.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...aim your pistols.<br> One.<br> Two.<br> Three.<br> Is he dead?<br> Quite dead.<br> This has been a sad day's work<br> for our family.<br> Ye've robbed us of 1,500 a year.<br> Now you'd better ride off<br> before the Police are up.<br> They'd wind of this<br> before we left Kilwangen.<br> Come on, Redmond, I'll go home with you.<br> How different Barry's fate<br> might have been...<br> ...had he not fallen in love<br> with Nora...<br> ...and had he not flung the wine<br> in Captain Quin's face.<br> But he was destined to be a wanderer.<br> And the battle with Quin set him<br> on his travels at an early age...<br> ...as you shall soon see.<br> The boy must go into hiding<br> for a short time, anyway.<br> Dublin's the best place for him.<br> He can stay there<br> 'til matters have blown over.<br> But the child has never been<br> away from home before.<br> Wouldn't he be as safe here?<br> I wish that were true, Aunt Belle.<br> But the Bailiffs may be<br> on their way already.<br> Now, Dublin is five days ride<br> away from here.<br> There's not a soul who'll know him there.<br> I don't want to harp<br> on unpleasant matters...<br> ...but you do know what can happen<br> to him if he's taken.<br> I'll be all right.<br> I'll be all right in Dublin, Mother.<br> No lad with liberty for the first time,<br> and 20 guineas in his pocket...<br> ...is very sad.<br> Barry rode towards Dublin<br> thinking not so much of...<br> ...the kind mother left alone,<br> and the home behind him...<br> ...but of tomorrow<br> and all the wonders it would bring.<br> Excuse me, miss.<br> Would it be possible to have<br> a drink of water?<br> Good day to you, young sir.<br> Good day.<br> Will you join us in a drink?<br> No, thank you.<br> Would you like something to eat?<br> That's very kind of you,<br> but I have to be on my way.<br> Thank you.<br> Goodbye.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Good morning again, young sir.<br> Don't even think about it.<br> Get down off that horse.<br> Raise your hands above your head, please.<br> Come forward.<br> Stop.<br> How do you do. I'm Captain Feeney.<br> Captain Feeney!<br> Captain Feeney, at your service.<br> The Captain Feeney?<br> None other.<br> May I introduce you to my son... Seamus?<br> To whom do I have<br> the honor of speaking?<br> My name's Redmond Barry.<br> How do you do, Mr. Barry?<br> Now we must get onto the more<br> regrettable stage of our brief acquaintance.<br> Turn around and keep your hands<br> high above your head, please.<br> There must be 20 guineas<br> in gold here, Father.<br> You seem to be a very well set up<br> young gentleman, sir.<br> Captain Feeney, that's all the money<br> my mother had in the world.<br> Mightn't I keep it?<br> I'm just one step ahead<br> of the Law myself.<br> I killed an English Officer in a duel, and<br> I'm going to Dublin until things cool down.<br> Mr. Barry...<br> ...in my profession<br> we hear many such stories.<br> Yours is the most intriguing and touching<br> I've heard in weeks.<br> Nevertheless,<br> I cannot grant your request.<br> But, I'll tell you what I will do.<br> I'll allow you to keep those fine boots,<br> which normally I would have for myself.<br> The next town is only five miles away.<br> And I suggest you now start walking.<br> Mightn't I keep my horse?<br> I would like to oblige you...<br> ...but, people like us must be able<br> to travel faster than our clients.<br> Good day, young sir.<br> You can put down your hands now,<br> Mr. Barry.<br> Gale's Regiment of Foot, commanded<br> by Lieutenant General Charles Gale...<br> ...which has distinguished itself<br> during the recent troubles...<br> ...wants several men to supply<br> the places of those veterans...<br> ...who have deserved to be pensioned<br> at one shilling a day.<br> All clever young fellows<br> who are free and able...<br> ...and are ambitious of becoming<br> gentlemen by bearing arms...<br> ...are hereby invited to meet<br> the Recruiting Officer...<br> ...who promises that they shall meet<br> with every encouragement...<br> ...that merit and good behavior<br> can entitle them to.<br> Those meeting the qualifications<br> will immediately receive...<br> ...His Majesty's Royal Bounty<br> of one and a half guineas...<br> ...with complete clothing, arms<br> and accoutrements.<br> King George and Old England forever.<br> For a young man in difficulty...<br> ...who had killed a man in a duel and<br> was anxious to find refuge from the Law...<br> ...the chance to earn distinction<br> in the European wars...<br> ...seemed a stroke of good fortune.<br> And King George needed men too much<br> to heed from whence they came.<br> Hey, lad! Lad!<br> Can I have a new beaker?<br> This one is full of grease.<br> Covered in grease!

It was made of tow.<br> Tow?<br> The Bradys wouldn't let you kill<br> The plan of the duel was arranged<br> in order to get you out of the way.<br> The cowardly Quin couldn't<br> be brought to marry...<br> ...from fear of you.<br> But hit him you certainly did, me lad.<br> With a fine thick plugget of tow.<br> He was so frightened,<br> it took him an hour to come to.<br> Are you in want of cash?<br> You may draw on me. For I got<br> a couple of hundred from your uncle.<br> While that lasts, you shall never want.<br> It would require a great historian<br> to explain the causes...<br> ...of the Seven Years' War in Europe...<br> ...to which Barry's regiment<br> was now on its way.<br> Let it suffice to say,<br> that England and Prussia were allies...<br> ...and at war against...<br> ...France, Sweden, Russia and Austria.<br> Barry's first taste of battle...<br> ...was only a skirmish against<br> a rearguard of Frenchmen...<br> ...who occupied an orchard<br> beside a road...<br> ...down which the English main force<br> wished to pass.<br> Though this encounter is not recorded<br> in any history book...<br> ...it was memorable enough<br> for those who took part.<br> I've only a hundred guineas<br> left to give you...<br> ...for I lost the rest at cards.<br> Kiss me, me boy,<br> for we'll never meet again.<br> It is well to dream of glorious war<br> in a snug armchair.<br> It is a different thing<br> to see it firsthand.<br> After his friend's death, Barry's thoughts<br> turned from military glory...<br> ...to those of escaping the Service...<br> ...to which he was tied for six years.<br> Gentlemen talk of the Age of Chivalry...<br> ...but remember the plowmen,<br> poachers and pickpockets they lead.<br> It is with these sad instruments<br> great warriors and kings...<br> ...have been doing their murderous work<br> in the world.<br> Barry could not have fallen<br> into worse circumstances...<br> ...than those in which he found himself.<br> But fate did not intend he should<br> remain long an English soldier.<br> An accident occurred...<br> ...which took him out of the Service<br> in a rather singular manner.<br> Freddie, I hope you won't be angry<br> with me, but...<br> ...I've got something to tell you<br> which you won't be happy about.<br> What is it?<br> First, promise me<br> you'll keep your temper.<br> Jonathan, don't be an ass!<br> You're making a big mystery of it.<br> What is going on?<br> I have to go away again.<br> For about two weeks.<br> Oh, God, you're not serious?<br> I am. There's nothing I can do about it.<br> Where to this time?<br> To Bremen, carrying important despatches<br> to Prince Henry.<br> But you promised me last time<br> it would be never again.<br> I know. And I've kept my part<br> of the bargain, but...<br> ...Pontersby insists I'm the only one<br> who can be entrusted with the trip.<br> Here was the opportunity to escape from<br> the Army for which he had been searching.<br> It was only a few miles to the area<br> occupied by their Prussian allies...<br> ...where this Officer's uniform<br> and papers...<br> ...should allow him to travel<br> without suspicion...<br> ...and to stay ahead of the news<br> of his desertion.<br> Then, we'll have little time together.<br> Are you cross with me?<br> Damn you, I can't stay cross<br> with you for long.<br> Oh, Jonathan...<br> ...at times like this I realize<br> how much I care for you...<br> ...and how empty life would be<br> without you.<br> Frederick!<br> Barry was glad to see the uniforms<br> of the Prussian Infantry.<br> They showed him that he was<br> out of English occupied territory.<br> His intention was to make for Holland...<br> ...almost the only neutral country<br> in Europe, in those times...<br> ...and thence to get a passage home,<br> somehow.<br> As he rode away...<br> ...Barry felt he was now<br> in his proper sphere.<br> And determined never again<br> to fall from the rank of a gentleman.<br> Excuse me, miss.<br> Yes.<br> Good day.<br> Good day.<br> Do you speak English?<br> I'm speaking little.<br> I have not eaten all day, no food.<br> Is there an inn nearby<br> where I might have a meal?<br> No... I don't think so.<br> There is nothing to eat before Grnberg.<br> Do you live near here?<br> Yes.<br> Would you... feed me?<br> I'd be happy to pay you.<br> I think so.<br> Is it a boy or girl?<br> A boy.<br> What's his name?<br> Peter.<br> How old is he?<br> He's one year old.<br> Where is Peter's father?<br> Where he is?<br> Yes.<br> In the war.<br> How long has he been gone?<br> Sorry... I didn't understand.<br> What?<br> Oh! A long time.<br> Since springtime.<br> It must be hard for you to be alone.<br> It is.<br> It must be dangerous for you in the war.<br> I'm an Officer and must do my duty.<br> You are sometimes...<br> ...lonely?<br> Sometimes.<br> What did you say your name is?<br> Lieutenant Fakenham.<br> No, I mean...<br> ...what is the name before Fakenham?<br> My first name?<br> Jonathan.<br> Would you like...<br> ...to stay with me?<br> For a few days, or sometimes?<br> That would be very nice.<br> Goodbye, my beautiful Lischen.<br> Goodbye, Redmond.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Look after yourself.<br> God be with you.<br> A lady who sets her heart<br> on a lad in uniform...<br> ...must be prepared to change lovers<br> pretty quickly...<br> ...or her life will be a sad one.<br> This heart of Lischen's was like<br> many a neighboring town...<br> ...that had been stormed and occupied<br> many times before Barry came to invest it.<br> During five years of war...<br> ...the illustrious Frederick had<br> so exhausted the males of his kingdom...<br> ...that he had to employ recruiters...<br> ...who would commit any crime,<br> including kidnapping...<br> ...to keep supplied those brilliant<br> regiments of his with cannon fodder.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> I'm Captain Potzdorf.<br> To whom have I the honor of speaking?<br> Good evening. I'm Lieutenant Fakenham,<br> Gale's Regiment of Foot.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> Can we be of assistance to you?<br> Thank you, but I am carrying urgent<br> despatches and must continue on my way.<br> And your destination?<br> Bremen.<br> Then you're obviously lost, Lieutenant.<br> Bremen is in the opposite direction.<br> Are you sure?<br> Yes.<br> Wouldn't you know it!<br> My departure was so hasty that<br> my orderly forgot to prepare proper maps.<br> I understand.<br> Please, do not be offended, Lieutenant...<br> ...but are you carrying<br> your identity papers?<br> Yes, of course.<br> May I see them?<br> Of course.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Lieutenant,<br> I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.<br> Not at all.<br> Now that we are riding<br> in the same direction...<br> ...may I offer you a meal and a bed<br> for the night...<br> ...and a proper map for the journey?<br> That's kind of you, Captain.<br> I'd be honored to accept.<br> Barry was treated with great civility...<br> ...and was asked questions<br> about England.<br> He answered as best he could,<br> inventing many stories.<br> He described the King and Ministers...<br> ...boasted that the British Ambassador<br> in Berlin was his uncle...<br> ...and even offered Potzdorf<br> a letter of introduction.<br> His host seemed satisfied<br> with these stories.<br> But, he led Barry on with<br> a skillful combination of questions...<br> ...and flattery.<br> I know so little of your country<br> of England...<br> ...except that you are<br> the bravest nation in the world...<br> ...and that we are fortunate<br> to have such allies.<br> Lieutenant Fakenham...<br> ...let us drink to the friendship<br> of our two great nations.<br> To our two great nations.<br> Aren't you lucky,<br> going to Bremen tomorrow?<br> I know one of the loveliest women<br> in Europe there.<br> Would you take a letter to her?<br> Certainly.<br> By the way, to whom are you carrying<br> your despatches?<br> General Williamson.<br> General Williamson?<br> General Percival Williamson?<br> Yes, the same.<br> This man is under arrest.<br> Under arrest? Captain Potzdorf, sir...<br> ...I'm a British Officer.<br> You're a liar and an imposter.<br> You're a deserter.<br> I suspected you this morning.<br> Your lies and folly have confirmed this.<br> You pretend to carry despatches<br> to a General, dead these ten months.<br> You say the British Ambassador in Berlin...<br> ...is your uncle,<br> with the ridiculous name of O'Grady.<br> Now, will you join and take the bounty,<br> or be given up?<br> I volunteer.<br> The Prussian Service was worse<br> than the English.<br> The life of a Private Soldier<br> was frightful.<br> Punishment was incessant.<br> Every Officer had the right to inflict it.<br> The gauntlet was a common penalty<br> for minor offenses.<br> More serious ones were punishable<br> by mutilation or death.<br> At the close of the Seven Years' War<br> the army...<br> ...renowned for its disciplined valor,<br> was officered by native Prussians.<br> But it was mostly composed...<br> ...of men from the lowest levels<br> of humanity...<br> ...hired or stolen<br> from every nation in Europe.<br> Thus, Barry fell<br> into the worst company...<br> ...and was soon far advanced in<br> the science of every kind of misconduct.<br> Help.<br> Get me out of here.<br> The Colonel's speech declared<br> the King's satisfaction...<br> ...with the conduct of the Regiment<br> at the Battle of Audorf...<br> ...and with Corporal Barry's bravery<br> in rescuing Captain Potzdorf...<br> ...which was to be rewarded<br> with the sum of two frederick d'or.<br> Corporal Barry, eight paces forward...<br> ...march!<br> Corporal Barry.<br> You're a gallant soldier,<br> and evidently of good stock...<br> ...but you're idle and unprincipled.<br> You're a bad influence on the men.<br> And for all your bravery,<br> I'm sure you'll come to no good.<br> I hope the Colonel is mistaken.<br> I have fallen into bad company,<br> but I've only done as other soldiers do.<br> I've never had a friend<br> or protector before...<br> ...to show that I was worthy<br> of better things.<br> The Colonel may say I'm ruined,<br> and send me to the Devil.<br> But, I would go to the Devil<br> to serve the Regiment.<br> Corporal Barry, fall in.<br> The war ended and Barry's regiment<br> was garrisoned in the Capital.<br> He had, for some time, ingratiated himself<br> with Captain Potzdorf...<br> ...whose confidence in him<br> was about to bring its reward.<br> Good morning, Redmond.<br> Good morning, Captain.<br> I should like you to meet my uncle,<br> the Minister of Police.<br> Good morning, Herr Minister.<br> Redmond...<br> ...I've spoken to the Minister regarding<br> your services and your fortune is made.<br> We shall get you out of the Army...<br> ...appoint you to the Police Bureau,<br> and, in time...<br> ...we'll allow you to move<br> in a better sphere.<br> Thank you, Captain.<br> Your loyalty to me and service<br> to the Regiment has pleased me.<br> Now there is another occasion<br> on which you can assist us.<br> If you succeed...<br> ...your reward will be secure.<br> I'll do my best, sir.<br> There is a gentleman in Berlin<br> in the service of the Empress of Austria.<br> He calls himself<br> the Chevalier de Balibari.<br> He appears to be a professional gambler.<br> He's a libertine:<br> Fond of women, of good food...<br> ...polished, obliging.<br> He speaks French and German indifferently.<br> But we have reason to fancy<br> that Monsieur de Balibari...<br> ...is a native of your country of Ireland.<br> And that he has come here as a spy.<br> Your knowledge of English...<br> ...makes you an ideal choice<br> to go into his service...<br> ...and find out whether or not<br> he is a spy.<br> Does this assignment interest you?<br> Minister, I'm interested in anything<br> that can be of service to you...<br> ...and Captain Potzdorf.<br> You will not know a word of English.<br> If the Chevalier remarks on your accent,<br> say you are Hungarian.<br> You served in the war.<br> You left the Army for medical reasons...<br> ...then served Monsieur de Quellenberg<br> for two years.<br> He's now with the Army in Silesia,<br> but you'll have a certificate from him.<br> Good morning, Your Honor.<br> So you are the young man<br> recommended by Seebach.<br> Yes, Your Honor,<br> here are my credentials.<br> Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> Monsieur de Quellenberg<br> recommends you highly.<br> Monsieur is a very good man.<br> It was imprudent of him...<br> ...but when Barry saw<br> the Chevalier's splendor...<br> ...and noble manner...<br> ...he felt unable to keep disguise<br> with him.<br> Those who have never been exiled...<br> ...know not what it is to hear<br> a friendly voice in captivity...<br> ...and would not understand the cause...<br> ...of the burst of feeling<br> now about to take place.<br> You seem the right one to me.<br> Thank you, Your Honor.<br> Are you ill?<br> Sir...<br> ...I have a confession to make to you.<br> I'm an Irishman.<br> My name is Redmond Barry.<br> I was abducted into the Prussian Army.<br> Now I've been put into your service...<br> ...by my Captain Potzdorf<br> and his uncle, the Minister of Police...<br> ...to serve as a watch<br> upon your... actions...<br> ...and to give information to them.<br> The Chevalier was much affected<br> at thus finding one of his countrymen.<br> For he too was an exile.<br> And a friendly voice, a look...<br> ...brought the old country<br> back to his memory.<br> He is very religious<br> and attends church regularly.<br> After Mass he comes home for breakfast.<br> He then takes an airing in his carriage.<br> Barry presented his reports<br> regularly to the Minister.<br> The details were arranged<br> beforehand with the Chevalier.<br> He was instructed to tell the truth...<br> ...as much as his story<br> would possibly bear.<br> The information he gave<br> was very minute and accurate...<br> ...though not very important.<br> Wine or punch, Your Honor?<br> Wine.<br> It was agreed that Barry should keep<br> his character of valet.<br> That, before strangers,<br> he should not know a word of English.<br> And that he should keep a lookout<br> on the trumps when serving the wine.<br> Having excellent eyesight...<br> ...and a natural aptitude...<br> ...he was able to give his dear patron<br> much assistance...<br> ...against his opponents<br> at the green table.<br> If, for instance, he wiped<br> the table with a napkin...<br> ...the enemy was strong in Diamonds.<br> If he adjusted a chair it meant Ace King.<br> If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...<br> ...Hearts were meant, and so forth.<br> The Prince of Tbingen...<br> ...who had intimate connections<br> with the Great Frederick...<br> ...was passionately fond of play<br> as were the gentlemen...<br> ...of almost all the Courts of Europe.<br> You owe 15,500 frederick d'or.<br> Chevalier...<br> ...though I cannot say how...<br> ...I believe you have cheated me.<br> I deny Your Grace's accusation...<br> ...and beg you to say<br> how you have been cheated.<br> I don't know.<br> But I believe I have been.<br> Your Grace owes me<br> ...which I have honorably won.<br> Chevalier...<br> ...if you will have your money now<br> you must fight for it.<br> If you will be patient...<br> ...maybe I will pay you something<br> another time.<br> Your Grace, if I am to be so tame<br> as to take this...<br> ...then I must give up an honorable<br> and lucrative occupation.<br> I have said all there is to be said.<br> I am at your disposal<br> for whatever purposes you wish.<br> Good night.<br> Was the Prince cheated?<br> In as far as I am able to tell,<br> Herr Minister, no.<br> I believe he won the money fairly.<br> What are the Chevalier's intentions?<br> I'm not sure.<br> The Prince told him that if he wanted<br> his money he'd have to fight for it.<br> A meeting with the Prince is impossible.<br> The Prince has left him no other choice.<br> Will you be able to return here tomorrow<br> without arousing suspicion?<br> I know they won't allow a meeting<br> with the Prince.<br> But if I say that, do you know any reason<br> why he'll pay me what he owes?<br> You must tell them I intend<br> to demand satisfaction.<br> Don't look so downcast, my boy.<br> They cannot harm me,<br> the Austrian Embassy will see to that.<br> The worst they can do is send me<br> out of this dreary country of theirs.<br> If they should, don't worry...<br> ...you shall not be left behind.<br> Have no fear of that.<br> The King has determined to send<br> the Chevalier out of the country.<br> Has he already demanded satisfaction?<br> Not yet, but I believe he intends to...<br> ...possibly today.<br> Then this must be done tomorrow.<br> All the arrangements are made.<br> You said he takes a drive<br> after breakfast every day.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Is there any reason he should do<br> any different tomorrow?<br> No, sir.<br> Good.<br> When the Chevalier comes out<br> to his carriage in the morning...<br> ...two Officers will meet him<br> and escort him to the frontier.<br> His baggage will be sent after him.<br> Excellent.<br> At ten o'clock the next morning...<br> ...the Chevalier de Balibari...<br> ...went out for his regular morning drive.<br> Where's my servant, Lazlo?<br> I will let down the steps, Your Honor.<br> What is this about?<br> Please get inside.<br> Am I under arrest?<br> We're driving to the frontier.<br> Frontier? But I'm on my way<br> to the Austrian Ambassador's house.<br> My orders are to escort you<br> to the frontier...<br> ...and see you safely across the border.<br> But, I'm not going to the frontier.<br> I have very important business<br> at the Austrian Ambassador's house.<br> My orders are to take Your Honor<br> to the frontier by any means necessary.<br> If you come willingly...<br> ...I'm to give you this purse<br> on behalf of the Prince of Tbingen...<br> ...containing 2,000 frederick d'or.<br> All Europe shall hear of this.<br> And so, without papers or passport...<br> ...and under the eyes<br> of two Prussian Officers...<br> ...Barry was escorted across the frontier<br> into Saxony and freedom.<br> The Chevalier himself had uneventfully<br> crossed the frontier the night before.<br> By these wonderful circumstances,<br> Barry was once more free...<br> ...and began his professional work<br> as a gamester...<br> ...resolving, thenceforward and forever,<br> to live the life of a gentleman.<br> The four wins.<br> Soon he and the Chevalier were received<br> in all the Courts of Europe...<br> ...and were speedily...<br> ...in the very best society<br> where play was patronized...<br> ...and professors of that science<br> always welcome.<br> The seven.<br> Why not the seven?<br> All... all, yes.<br> No more bets.<br> Number seven...<br> ...loses.<br> Place your bets.<br> Chevalier, will you give me credit<br> for 5,000 louis d'or, please?<br> Of course, Lord Ludd.<br> Five thousand.<br> Now, everything on the four.<br> Yes, I know, everything on the four.<br> No more bets.<br> The four loses.<br> It is not important.<br> Now, I'm weary.<br> I would like dinner. Shall we?<br> Excuse me, Lord Ludd.<br> If you don't mind.<br> Not at all.<br> They always played on credit with<br> any person of honor or noble lineage.<br> They never pressed for their winnings...<br> ...or declined to receive<br> promissory notes.<br> But woe to the man who did not pay<br> when the note became due.<br> Barry was sure to wait upon him<br> with his bill.<br> There were few bad debts.<br> Saluez.<br> It was Barry's skill with the sword,<br> and readiness to use it...<br> ...that maintained the reputation<br> of the firm, so to speak.<br> On guard!<br> I will pay you today, sir.<br> Thus, it will be seen, their life...<br> ...for all its splendor,<br> was not without danger and difficulty...<br> ...requiring talent and determination<br> for success.<br> And required them to live<br> a wandering and disconnected life.<br> And, though they were swimming<br> upon the high tide of fortune...<br> ...and prospering with the cards,<br> they had little to show for their labor...<br> ...but some fine clothes<br> and a few trinkets.<br> Five years in the Army,<br> and considerable experience of the world...<br> ...had dispelled any romantic notions<br> regarding love...<br> ...with which Barry commenced life.<br> And he had it in mind,<br> as many gentlemen had done before him...<br> ...to marry a woman<br> of fortune and condition.<br> And, as such things so often happen...<br> ...these thoughts coincided<br> with his setting sight upon a lady...<br> ...who will play a considerable part<br> in the drama of his life.<br> The Countess of Lyndon...<br> ...Viscountess Bullingdon of England...<br> ...Baroness Castle Lyndon of Ireland.<br> A woman of vast wealth and great beauty.<br> She was the wife of Sir Charles Lyndon...<br> ...Knight of the Bath...<br> ...Minister to George III<br> at several of the Courts of Europe.<br> A cripple, wheeled about in a chair...<br> ...worn out by gout<br> and a myriad of diseases.<br> Her Ladyship's Chaplain, Mr. Runt...<br> ...acted as tutor to her son,<br> the little Viscount Bullingdon...<br> ...a melancholy little boy,<br> much attached to his mother.<br> I'm going outside for a breath of air.<br> Yes, My Lady.<br> To make a long story short...<br> ...six hours after they met...<br> Her Ladyship was in love.<br> And once Barry got into her company...<br> ...he found innumerable occasions<br> to improve his intimacy...<br> ...and was scarcely out<br> of Her Ladyship's sight.<br> Good evening, gentlemen.<br> Sir Charles.<br> Good evening, Mr. Barry.<br> Have you done with my Lady?<br> Pardon?<br> Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather<br> be known as a cuckold than a fool.<br> I think, Sir Charles,<br> that you've had too much to drink.<br> What?<br> As it happens, your Chaplain, Mr. Runt,<br> introduced me to your Lady...<br> ...to advise me on a religious matter,<br> of which she is an expert.<br> He wants... to step into my shoes.<br> He wants to step into my shoes.<br> Is it not a pleasure for me,<br> as I am drawing near the goal...<br> ...to find my home such a happy one...<br> ...my wife so fond of me, that she is even<br> now thinking of appointing a successor?<br> Isn't it a comfort to see her<br> like a prudent housewife...<br> ...getting everything ready<br> for my departure?<br> I hope you're not thinking of leaving us,<br> Sir Charles?<br> Not so soon as you may fancy, perhaps.<br> I've been given over many times<br> these four years.<br> And there was always<br> a candidate or two...<br> ...waiting to apply for the situation.<br> I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.<br> It grieves me to keep you<br> or any gentleman waiting.<br> Had you not better arrange<br> with my doctor...<br> ...or have the cook flavor my omelet<br> with arsenic, eh?<br> What are the odds, gentlemen,<br> that I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?<br> Sir, let those laugh that win.<br> Gentlemen.<br> I'll get a surgeon.<br> Have some brandy, Sir Charles.<br> From a report in<br> The Saint James' Chronicle:<br> "Died at Spa in Belgium...<br> "...Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon...<br> "...Knight of the Bath,<br> Member of Parliament...<br> "...and for many years...<br> "...His Majesty's Representative<br> at various European Courts.<br> "He has left behind him a name<br> which is endeared to all his friends."<br> "Dearly beloved...<br> "...we are gathered together<br> here in the sight of God...<br> "...and in the face of this congregation...<br> "...to join together this man<br> and this woman in holy matrimony."<br> A year later,<br> on the fifteenth of June...<br> ...in the year 1773...<br> ...Redmond Barry had the honor to lead<br> to the altar the Countess of Lyndon.<br> The ceremony was performed by the<br> Reverend Runt, Her Ladyship's Chaplain.<br> "And therefore is not in any way<br> to be enterprized...<br> "...nor taken in hand unadvisedly...<br> "...lightly or wantonly...<br> "...to satisfy men's carnal lusts<br> and appetites...<br> "...like brute beasts<br> that have no understanding.<br> "But reverently...<br> "...discreetly...<br> "...advisedly...<br> "...soberly...<br> "...and in the fear of God.<br> "Duly considering the causes<br> for which

name.<br> "Secondly...<br> "...it was ordained for a remedy<br> against sin, and to avoid fornication."<br> Barry had now arrived<br> at the pitch of prosperity...<br> ...and by his own energy had raised<br> himself to a higher sphere of society...<br> ...having procured His Majesty's<br> gracious permission to add the name...<br> ...of his lovely Lady to his own.<br> Thenceforth, Redmond Barry<br> assumed the style...<br> ...and title of Barry Lyndon.<br> Redmond, would you mind not smoking<br> for a while?<br> Lady Lyndon was soon destined<br> to occupy a place in Barry's life...<br> ...not very much more important<br> than the elegant carpets and pictures...<br> ...which would form<br> the pleasant background of his existence.<br> My Lord Bullingdon,<br> you seem particularly glum today?<br> You should be happy<br> that your mother has remarried.<br> Not in this way.<br> And not in such haste.<br> And certainly not to this man.<br> I think you judge your mother too harshly.<br> Do you not like your new father?<br> Not very much.<br> He seems to me little more<br> than a common opportunist.<br> I don't think he loves my mother at all.<br> And it hurts me to see her<br> make such a fool of herself.<br> At the end of a year Her Ladyship<br> presented Barry with a son.<br> Bryan Patrick Lyndon, they called him.<br> Her Ladyship and Barry lived,<br> after a while, pretty separate.<br> She preferred quiet, or to say the truth,<br> he preferred it for her...<br> ...being a great friend to a modest<br> and tranquil behavior in woman.<br> Besides, she was a mother,<br> and would have great comfort...<br> ...in the dressing, educating<br> and dandling of their little Bryan.<br> For whose sake it was fit,<br> Barry believed...<br> ...that she should give up the pleasures<br> and frivolities of the world...<br> ...leaving that part of the duty<br> of every family of distinction...<br> ...to be performed by him.<br> Lady Lyndon tended to a melancholy<br> and maudlin temper...<br> ...and, left alone by her husband,<br> was rarely happy or in good humor.<br> Now she must add jealousy<br> to her other complaints...<br> ...and find rivals even among her maids.<br> Samuel, what would the time be?<br> Twenty-five minutes past eleven,<br> My Lady.<br> Shall we make this the last game, ladies?<br> Good morning, ladies.<br> Would you mind excusing us?<br> I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.<br> I'm sorry.<br> This coat is made of the finest velvet...<br> ...all cunningly worked<br> with silver thread.<br> No finer velvet has ever been woven,<br> and you will see none better anywhere.<br> Pardon me, gentlemen.<br> Good morning, dearest.<br> We're taking the children for a ride<br> to the village. We'll be back for tea.<br> Have a nice time. I'll see you then.<br> Goodbye, little Bryan.<br> Lord Bullingdon.<br> Take good care of your mother.<br> Come now, give your father a proper kiss.<br> Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...is that the way to behave<br> to your father?<br> Lord Bullingdon,<br> have you lost your tongue?<br> My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.<br> I have not forgotten him, if others have.<br> Lord Bullingdon,<br> you have insulted your father!<br> Madam, you have insulted my father.<br> Dearest, would you excuse us?<br> We have something to discuss in private.<br> Gentlemen.<br> One.<br> Two.<br> Six.<br> Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...I have always been willing<br> to live with you on friendly terms.<br> But be clear about one thing:<br> As men serve me, I serve them.<br> I never laid a cane on the back<br> of a Lord before...<br> ...but, if you force me to, I shall<br> speedily become used to the practice.<br> Do you have anything to say for yourself?<br> No.<br> You may go.<br> Barry believed, and not without<br> some reason, that it had been...<br> ...a declaration of war against him<br> by Bullingdon from the start...<br> ...and that the evil consequences<br> that ensued...<br> ...were entirely of Bullingdon's creating.<br> I shall make you into<br> a real magician now, Bryan.<br> I shall show you the knot that never was.<br> As Bullingdon grew up to be a man...<br> ...his hatred for Barry<br> assumed an intensity...<br> ...equaled only by his<br> increased devotion to his mother.<br> Very good, Bryan. A little bow.<br> Put it on the table for me.<br> Thank you.<br> For Bryan's eighth birthday the local<br> nobility, gentry and their children...<br> ...came to pay their respects.<br> The inside and outside are quite empty.<br> Wave your hand over the top.<br> Is there anything there?<br> Wonderful! Wonderful, colorful<br> silk handkerchiefs!<br> Take a bow, Bryan,<br> you did that beautifully.<br> Very good.<br> Let's see if you have something<br> behind your ear.<br> Yes, you have.<br> A little ball. Let's make it vanish.<br> It's gone.<br> Here it is, behind my elbow.<br> Wave your hand<br> over my green silk handkerchief...<br> ...and see if we can produce<br> a magic flower. I wonder if we can?<br> Here it comes.<br> The colors of the rainbow.<br> You know all the colors of the rainbow<br> produce but one color, Bryan.<br> Nothing in my magic cabinet.<br> They produce the color... white.<br> And there is my own...<br> ...beautiful white rabbit.<br> Bryan, you have done very well.<br> A little bow.<br> We crept up on their fort,<br> and I jumped over the wall first.<br> My fellows jumped after me.<br> You should have seen the Frenchmen's<br> faces when 23 rampaging he-devils...<br> ...sword and pistol, cut and thrust,<br> came tumbling into their fort.<br> In three minutes we left<br> as many Artillery men's heads...<br> ...as there were cannon balls.<br> Later we were visited<br> by our noble Prince Henry.<br> "Who is the man who has done this?"<br> I stepped forward.<br> "How many heads was it<br> that you cut off?" He says.<br> "Nineteen," says I,<br> "besides wounding several."<br> Well, I'll be blessed,<br> if he didn't burst into tears.<br> "Noble, noble fellow," he said.<br> "Here is nineteen golden guineas,<br> one for each head that you cut off."<br> What do you think of that?<br> Were you allowed to keep the heads?<br> No, they always become<br> the property of the King.<br> Will you tell me another story?<br> I'll tell you one tomorrow.<br> Will you play cards with me tomorrow?<br> Of course I will. Now go to sleep.<br> Will you keep the candles lit?<br> Bryan, big boys don't sleep<br> with the candles lit.<br> I'm afraid of the dark.<br> My darling, there's nothing<br> to be afraid of.<br> But, I like it with the candles lit.<br> All right, you can sleep<br> with the candles lit.<br> Thank you, Papa.<br> Good night.<br> Ah, Redmond!<br> It's a blessing to see my darling boy<br> has attained a position I knew was his due.<br> And for which I pinched myself<br> to educate him.<br> Little Bryan is a darling boy...<br> ...and you live in great splendor.<br> Your lady wife knows<br> she has a treasure...<br> ...she couldn't have had,<br> had she married a Duke.<br> But, if she should tire<br> of my wild Redmond...<br> ...and his old-fashioned Irish ways...<br> ...or if she should die...<br> ...what future would there be<br> for my son, and my grandson?<br> You have not a penny of your own...<br> ...and cannot transact any business<br> without her signature.<br> Upon her death the entire estate<br> would go to young Bullingdon...<br> ...who bears you little affection.<br> You could be penniless tomorrow...<br> ...and darling Bryan at the mercy<br> of his stepbrother.<br> Shall I tell you something?<br> There is only one way for you<br> and your son to have real security.<br> You must obtain a title.<br> I shall not rest<br> until I see you Lord Lyndon.<br> You have important friends.<br> They can tell you<br> how these things are done.<br> For money, well-timed<br> and properly applied...<br> ...can accomplish anything.<br> And Barry was acquainted with someone<br> who knew how these things were done.<br> This was the distinguished Barrister<br> and former Government Minister...<br> ...Lord Hallam...<br> ...whose acquaintance he had made,<br> like so many others, at the gaming table.<br> Do you happen to know<br> the Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?<br> I don't believe I do.<br> Well, this nobleman is one<br> of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...<br> ...with whom our revered Monarch<br> is on terms of considerable intimacy.<br> In my opinion, you would be wise<br> to fix upon him...<br> ...your chief reliance for the advancement<br> of your claim to the peerage.<br> When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon,<br> he, or she, is safe.<br> There is no question about them anymore.<br> My friends are the best people.<br> I don't mean they're the most virtuous...<br> ...or, indeed, the least virtuous,<br> or the cleverest...<br> ...or the stupidest,<br> richest or best born.<br> But, the best.<br> In a word, people about whom<br> there is no question.<br> I cannot promise how long it will take.<br> You can appreciate<br> it is not an easy matter.<br> But, any gentleman with an estate,<br> and 30,000 a year...<br> ...should have a peerage.<br> And there standing behind me<br> was a total stranger.<br> I looked at him, and he said to me:<br> "Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,<br> is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"<br> I was so astonished,<br> I couldn't think of what to say.<br> Then I became angry,<br> and said to him, "He's dead."<br> The striving after this peerage was<br> one of Barry's most unlucky dealings.<br> He made great sacrifices<br> to bring it about.<br> He lavished money here,<br> and diamonds there.<br> He bought lands<br> at ten times their value...<br> ...purchased pictures and articles<br> of virtue at ruinous prices.<br> He gave entertainments<br> to those friends to his claim...<br> ...all, being about the Royal person,<br> were likely to advance it.<br> And, I can tell you, bribes were<br> administered. And in high places, too.<br> So near the person of His Majesty<br> that you would be astonished to know...<br> ...what great noblemen condescended<br> to receive his loans.<br> This is by Ludovico Cordi...<br> ...a disciple of Alessandro Allori.<br> It's dated 1605...<br> ...and shows,<br> "The Adoration of The Magi."<br> It's beautiful.<br> Yes.<br> I love the use of the color blue<br> by the artist.<br> Yes, that is very beautiful.<br> What is the price of this one?<br> Well, this is one of my best pictures.<br> But, if you really like it, I'm sure<br> we can come to some arrangement.<br> Lord Wendover, Your Majesty.<br> I'm glad to see you here today,<br> Lord Wendover.<br> What news of Lady Wendover?<br> Thank you, Your Majesty.<br> Lady Wendover is much better.<br> Good! Present my compliments to her.<br> Say we miss her company here.<br> And what of those excellent boys<br> of yours?<br> They're well. Charles has gone to sea<br> under Captain Geary on the Ramillies.<br> John has gone to Oxford to learn<br> how to preach and pray.<br> Good, good!<br> Your Majesty, may I present<br> Mr. Barry Lyndon.<br> Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond<br> of Sir Charles Lyndon.<br> And how is Lady Lyndon?<br> She's very well, Your Majesty.<br> Mr. Lyndon raised a company of troops<br> to fight in America against the rebels.<br> Good, Mr. Lyndon. Raise another company<br> and go with them, too.<br> Barry was born clever enough<br> at gaining a fortune...<br> ...but incapable of keeping one.<br> For the qualities and energies<br> which lead a man to achieve the first...<br> ...are often the very cause of his ruin<br> in the latter case.<br> Now he was burdened with<br> the harassing cares and responsibilities...<br> ...which are the dismal adjuncts<br> of great rank and property.<br> And his life now...<br> ...seemed to consist mostly of drafts<br> of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...<br> ...and endless correspondence...<br> ...with decorators and cooks.<br> Gentlemen, I'm going to leave you for<br> a few minutes. Carry on with your work.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Bully.<br> What does...<br> ..."strenuous" mean?<br> Bryan, I'm trying to work.<br> But what does it mean?<br> It means "an effort requiring strength."<br> What does "quadrangle" mean?<br> A quadrangle is a four-sided figure<br> like a square or a rectangle.<br> Now, please be quiet,<br> and let me get on with my work.<br> Bryan, please be quiet!<br> Have you seen my pencil?<br> No, I haven't.<br> Bryan, please stop making so much noise.<br> That's my pencil.<br> No, it isn't.<br> It is. It's my pencil!<br> I've had this all morning.<br> It's my pencil!<br> Listen, will you be quiet!<br> It's my pencil!<br> I'll teach you a lesson.<br> What the devil's going on in here?<br> I told you never<br> to lay a hand on this child.<br> One.<br> Two.<br> Six.<br> Will that be all, Mr. Redmond Barry?<br> Yes, that will be all.<br> Well then, look you now.<br> From this moment, I will submit<br> to no further chastisement from you.<br> I will kill you, if you lay hands<br> on me ever again.<br> Is that clear to you, sir?<br> Get out of here!<br> Don't you think he fits my shoes<br> very well, Your Ladyship?<br> Dear child...<br> ...what a pity it is I'm not dead,<br> for your sake.<br> The Lyndons would then have<br> a worthy representative...<br> ...and enjoy all the benefits...<br> ...of the illustrious blood<br> of the Barrys of Barryville.<br> Would they not...<br> ...Mr. Redmond Barry?<br> From the way I love this child...<br> ...you ought to know how<br> I would've loved his elder brother...<br> ...had he proved worthy<br> of any mother's affection.<br> Madam!<br> I have borne as long<br> as mortal could endure...<br> ...the ill-treatment of the insolent Irish<br> upstart whom you've taken to your bed.<br> It is not only his lowly birth and the<br> brutality of his manners which disgust me.<br> But the shameful nature of his conduct<br> toward Your Ladyship...<br> ...his brutal and ungentlemanlike<br> behavior...<br> ...his open infidelity...<br> ...his shameless robberies and swindling<br> of my property, and yours.<br> And as I cannot personally chastise<br> this low-bred ruffian, and cannot bear...<br> ...to witness his treatment of you...<br> ...and loathe his company<br> as if it were the plague...<br> ...I have decided to leave my home<br> and never return.<br> At least, during his detested life...<br> ...or during my own.<br> Will anyone be joining<br> Your Lordship?<br> No, I shall be alone.<br> The roast beef's very good, My Lord.<br> Hello, Neville. How are you?<br> Ah, Barry. Hello.<br> I see you're alone.<br> Why don't you join me?<br> Oh, thank you, Barry,<br> you're very kind, but...<br> ...I'm expecting someone to join me.<br> What a shame! Lady Lyndon and I<br> have missed your company lately.<br> Please give my respects to Lady Lyndon...<br> ...and say I've been very busy of late<br> and not been able to go about much.<br> I shall.<br> The eighth of next month we're<br> having some guests over for cards...<br> ...we'd love to have you<br> and Lady Wendover join us.<br> I'll check my diary, but I think<br> I'm engaged on that evening.<br> I hope you're not engaged.<br> We'd love to see you again.<br> I'll write and say if I'm free or not.<br> I look forward to hearing from you.<br> It's nice to see you again.<br> If he had murdered Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...Barry could scarcely have been received<br> with more coldness and resentment...<br> ...that now followed him<br> in town and country.<br> His friends fell away from him.<br> A legend arose of his cruelty<br> to his stepson.<br> Now all the bills came down<br> on him together.<br> All the bills he had been contracting<br> for the years of his marriage...<br> ...and which the creditors sent in<br> with a hasty unanimity.<br> Their amount was frightful.<br> Barry was now bound up in an<br> inextricable toil of bills and debts...<br> ...of mortgages and insurances,<br> and all the evils attendant upon them.<br> Lady Lyndon's income was hampered<br> almost irretrievably...<br> ...to satisfy these claims.<br> Do you think that's good?<br> Excellent.<br> Who's this?<br> It's a peacock on the wall.<br> What's it say?<br> I saw this bird yesterday.<br> Who's that?<br> Mama in her coach.<br> Is she going to London?<br> I don't know.<br> Barry had his faults...<br> ...but no man could say of him<br> that he was not a good and tender father.<br> He loved his son with a blind partiality.<br> He denied him nothing.<br> It is impossible to convey<br> what high hopes he had for the boy...<br> ...and how he indulged<br> in a thousand fond anticipations...<br> ...as to his future success<br> and figure in the world.<br> But fate had determined that he should<br> leave none of his race behind him...<br> ...that he should finish his life...<br> ...poor, lonely...<br> ...and childless.<br> Papa.<br> Yes, Bryan?<br> Will you buy me a horse?<br> Buy you a horse?<br> Yes, Papa.<br> But you already have little Julia.<br> She's only a pony, I want a real horse.<br> Then I can ride with you on the hunt.<br> You think you're big enough for the hunt?<br> Oh, yes!<br> Jonathan Plunkett is only a year older<br> than I am and he rides with his papa.<br> I'll have to think about it.<br> Please, say yes. There's nothing I want<br> in the whole world more than a horse.<br> I'll think about it.<br> Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you!<br> How much are you asking for him?<br> One hundred guineas.<br> He's a nice little horse,<br> but I don't think he's worth that.<br> Seventy-five seems<br> more like the right price.<br> I'll accept eighty guineas,<br> and not a shilling less.<br> Five guineas should never keep two<br> gentlemen from their drink. Eighty then.<br> Done, sir.<br> Take the horse to Doolan's farm.<br> Tell him he needs a bit of breaking in.<br> Say it's for Master Bryan's birthday,<br> and I want it to be a surprise.<br> And remember that yourself.<br> Papa.<br> What is it, lad?<br> Did you buy that horse?<br> What horse is that?<br> The horse you were going<br> to buy me for my birthday.<br> I know nothing about any horse.<br> But one of the stable boys told Nelly<br> you'd already bought it...<br> ...and it was at Doolan's farm<br> where Mick the groom was breaking it in.<br> Is that true?<br> When is your birthday?<br> Next Tuesday.<br> Well, you'll have to wait till then<br> to find out.<br> Then, it's true! Oh, thank you, Papa.<br> Yes, Mama?<br> Promise me you won't ride that horse<br> except with your father.<br> Yes, Mama, I promise.<br> And I promise you a good flogging...<br> ...if you even go to Doolan's farm<br> to see him before your birthday.<br> Yes, Papa.<br> You understand?<br> Yes, Papa.<br> You promise me?<br> Yes, Papa, I promise.<br> All right, eat your food.<br> I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lyndon...<br> ...but I believe Master Bryan<br> has disobeyed you...<br> ...and stolen away to Doolan's farm.<br> On going to his room this morning,<br> I found his bed empty.<br> One of the cooks saw him<br> cross the yard at daybreak.<br> Didn't you see him go?<br> He must have passed through my room<br> while I was asleep.<br> Oh, my God! What has happened here?<br> I noticed the lad riding<br> across the field, sir...<br> ...and having trouble with the horse,<br> which was playing up.<br> Suddenly the animal plunged and reared,<br> and the poor lad was thrown.<br> Oh, Bryan, why did you disobey me?<br> I'm sorry, Papa.<br> You won't whip me, will you?<br> No, my darling.<br> I won't whip you.<br> Take my horse and ride like the Devil<br> for Doctor Broughton.<br> Tell him whatever he's doing<br> he must come at once. Understand?<br> The doctors were called.<br> But what does a doctor avail in a contest<br> with the grim, invincible enemy?<br> Such as came could only confirm<br> the hopelessness of the poor child's case.<br> He remained with his parents<br> for two days.<br> And a sad comfort it was to know<br> that he was in no pain.<br> Papa.<br> Am I going to die?<br> No, my darling, you're not going to die.<br> You're going to get better.<br> But I can't feel anything,<br> except in my hands.<br> Does that mean I'm already dead<br> in part of my body?<br> No, my darling, that's where<br> you were hurt by the horse.<br> But you're going to be all right.<br> Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?<br> Of course you will, my darling...<br> ...but you're not going to die.<br> Mama, give me your hand.<br> Papa, give me your hand.<br> Will you both promise me something?<br> Yes.<br> Promise me never to quarrel so.<br> But to love each other.<br> So that we may meet again, in heaven...<br> ...where Bullingdon said<br> quarrelsome people will never go.<br> We promise.<br> Will you tell me the story<br> about the fort?<br> Of course.<br> We crept up on the fort.<br> I jumped over the wall first,<br> and my fellows jumped after me.<br> And you should have seen the look...<br> ...on the Frenchmen's faces when<br> ...cut and thrust,<br> came tumbling into the fort.<br> In three minutes...<br> ...we left...<br> "'I am the resurrection and the life,'<br> saith the Lord.<br> "'He that believeth in me,<br> though he were dead...<br> "'...yet shall he live.<br> "'And whosoever liveth<br> and believeth in me...<br> "'...shall never die.'<br> "I know that my Redeemer liveth...<br> "...and that He shall stand<br> at the latter day upon the earth.<br> "And though after my skin<br> worms destroy this body...<br> "...yet in my flesh shall I see God.<br> "Whom I shall see for myself<br> and mine eyes shall behold...<br> "...and not another.<br> "We brought nothing into this world...<br> "...and it is certain<br> we can carry nothing out.<br> "The Lord gave,<br> and the Lord hath taken away.<br> "Blessed is the name of the Lord."<br> Barry's grief was inconsolable.<br> Such solace as he could find,<br> came only from drink.<br> His mother was the only person who would<br> remain faithful to him in his misfortune.<br> And many a night, when he was<br> unconscious of her attention...<br> ...saw him carried off to bed.<br> "O blessed Lord...<br> "...the Father of mercies<br> and God of all comforts.<br> "We beseech Thee, look down<br> in pity and compassion upon this...<br> "...Thy afflicted servant.<br> "Thou writest bitter things against her...<br> "...and makest her to possess<br> her former iniquities."<br> Her Ladyship,<br> always vaporish and nervous...<br> ...plunged into devotion...<br> ...with so much fervor, that you would<br> have imagined her distracted at times.<br> In the doleful conditions<br> which now prevailed at Castle Hackton...<br> ...management of the household,<br> and of the Lyndon estate...<br> ...fell to Mrs. Barry,<br> whose spirit of order...<br> ...attended to all the details<br> of a great establishment.<br> You wish to see me, madam?<br> Yes, Reverend. Please sit down.<br> I have some matters I would like<br> to discuss later, Graham...<br> ...but just now would you go<br> to Her Ladyship...<br> ...and have her sign these papers.<br> Yes, madam.<br> Reverend Runt...<br> ...I need not tell you<br> that the recent tragedy to this family...<br> ...has made the services of a tutor<br> no longer required here.<br> And as we are in considerable difficulty<br> about money...<br> ...I'm afraid I must ask you,<br> with the greatest reluctance...<br> ...to resign your post.<br> Madam, I'm sensible<br> to your predicament...<br> ...and you need have no concern about<br> my wages, I can willingly forego them...<br> ...but it is out of the question for me<br> to leave Her Ladyship in her present state.<br> I'm sorry to say this to you...<br> ...but I believe you are largely responsible<br> for her present state of mind.<br> The sooner you leave,<br> the better she will be.<br> Madam, with the greatest respect...<br> ...I take my instructions<br> only from Her Ladyship.<br> Reverend Runt...<br> ...Her Ladyship is in no fit mind<br> to give instructions to anyone.<br> My son has charged me with managing<br> the affairs at Castle Hackton...<br> ...until he recovers from his grief and<br> resumes his interest in worldly matters.<br> While I'm in charge...<br> ...you'll take your instructions from me.<br> My only concern is for Lady Lyndon.<br> Madam...<br> ...your only concern is<br> for Her Ladyship's signature.<br> You and your son have almost succeeded<br> in destroying a fine family fortune.<br> And what little remains for you...<br> ...depends on keeping Her Ladyship<br> prisoner in her own home.<br> Reverend Runt...<br> ...this matter bears<br> no further discussion.<br> You will pack your bags<br> and leave by tomorrow.<br> God, help. Help!<br> In the midst of these great perplexities...<br> ...Her Ladyship made an attempt<br> to kill herself by taking poison.<br> Though she only made herself<br> dangerously ill...<br> ...due to the very small amount<br> which she swallowed...<br> ...this, nevertheless, caused<br> an intervention from a certain quarter...<br> ...which was long overdue.<br> Oh, my God!<br> If my mother had died...<br> ...it would've been as much<br> my responsibility...<br> ...as if I had poured<br> the strychnine for her myself.<br> For to the everlasting disgrace<br> of my family name...<br> ...I have, by my cowardice,<br> and by my weakness...<br> ...allowed the Barrys<br> to establish a brutal...<br> ...and ignorant tyranny over our lives...<br> ...which has left my mother<br> a broken woman...<br> ...and to squander and ruin<br> a fine family fortune.<br> My friends profess sympathy,<br> but behind my back...<br> ...I know I am despised.<br> And quite justifiably so.<br> However...<br> ...I know now what I must do.<br> And what I shall do.<br> Whatever be the cost.<br> Good morning, My Lord.<br> Good morning.<br> Is Mr. Barry Lyndon here?<br> Yes, My Lord, he's inside.<br> Mr. Redmond Barry.<br> The last occasion on which we met...<br> ...you wantonly caused me injury<br> and dishonor.<br> In such a manner, and to such an extent<br> no gentleman can willingly suffer...<br> ...without demanding satisfaction...<br> ...however much time intervenes.<br> I have now come to claim<br> that satisfaction.<br> Mr. Lyndon...<br> ...these are a matched pair of pistols,<br> and as you have seen...<br> ...your second has loaded one,<br> and I have loaded the other.<br> As they belong to Lord Bullingdon,<br> you may have whichever one you wish.<br> Lord Bullingdon.<br> Now, gentlemen, to determine<br> who will have first fire...<br> ...I will toss a coin in the air.<br> As the offended party, it is<br> Lord Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.<br> Is that agreeable to both of you?<br> Yes.<br> If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly<br> he will have the first fire.<br> If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon<br> will have the first fire.<br> Is that clearly understood?<br> What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?<br> Heads.<br> It is heads.<br> Lord Bullingdon will have the first fire.<br> Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...will you take your ground?<br> One... two... three...<br> ...four... five... six...<br> ...seven... eight... nine... ten.<br> Mr. Lyndon, will you take your ground?<br> Mr. Lyndon, are you ready to receive<br> Lord Bullingdon's fire?<br> Yes.<br> Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...cock your pistol...<br> ...and prepare to fire.<br> Sir Richard, this pistol must be faulty.<br> I must have another one.<br> I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon,<br> but you must first stand your ground...<br> ...and allow Mr. Lyndon his turn to fire.<br> That is correct, Lord Bullingdon.<br> Your pistol has fired,<br> and that counts as your shot.<br> Mr. Lyndon, are the rules of firing<br> clear to you?<br> Yes.<br> Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...are you ready to receive<br> Mr. Lyndon's fire?<br> Yes.<br> Very well, then.<br> Mr. Lyndon...<br> ...cock your pistol...<br> ...and prepare to fire.<br> Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?<br> Is your pistol cocked, Mr. Lyndon?<br> Yes.<br> Then prepare to fire.<br> One...<br> ...two...<br> Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon<br> having fired into the ground...<br> ...do you now consider<br> that you have received satisfaction?<br> I have not received satisfaction.<br> Mr. Lyndon, are you ready?<br> Yes.<br> Lord Bullingdon...<br> ...cock your pistol<br> and get ready to fire.<br> One...<br> ...two...<br> Barry was carried to an inn nearby<br> and a surgeon was called.<br> I'm nearly finished.<br> I'm sorry to have to tell you this,<br> Mr. Lyndon.<br> I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...<br> ...most likely below the knee.<br> Lose the leg?<br> What for?<br> The simple answer is to save your life.<br> The ball has shattered the bone<br> below the knee and severed the artery.<br> Unless I amputate, there's no way<br> that I can repair the artery...<br> ...and stop the hemorrhage.<br> Graham.<br> Yes, My Lord?<br> When we arrive at Castle Hackton,<br> inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.<br> Don't go into any unnecessary detail.<br> Just tell her where he is<br> and that he has been wounded in the leg.<br> She will want to go to him.<br> See that she is out of the house and<br> on her way to London as soon as possible.<br> And in no event...<br> ...is she to be allowed to see my mother...<br> ...or create any disturbance at the house<br> before she leaves.<br> Yes, My Lord.<br> Mrs. Barry, how do you do?<br> How nice to see you, Graham.<br> Come in.<br> Thank you.<br> You...
