That's 25.50 a week<br> payable in advance.<br> Check-out time's 12:00 sharp,<br> only forget that.<br> You're a res.<br> If you need anything,<br> pick up your personal in-room telephone.<br> If you need anything,<br> pick up your personal in-room telephone.<br> My name is Chet.<br> Although we provide privacy<br> for the residential guests,<br> we're a full-service hotel,<br> including complimentary shoe shine.<br> My name is Chet.<br> Okay.<br> Those your only bags?<br> The others are being sent.<br> Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. Fink.<br> Six, please.<br> Next stop... six.<br> This stop... six.<br> Is that him?<br> Is that Barton Fink?<br> Let me at him.<br> Let me put my arms<br> around this guy.<br> Let me hug this guy.<br> How the hell are ya?<br> Good trip?<br> My name's Jack Lipnick.<br> You know that.<br> You read the papers.<br> Lou treating you all right?<br> What's the matter<br> with your face?<br> What's the matter<br> with his face, Lou?<br> It's not so bad.<br> A mosquito in my room.<br> Where'd we put him?<br> I'm at the Earle.<br> Never heard of it.<br> Let's move him.<br> Stay at my place.<br> I wanted a place a little less...<br> Less Hollywood. Say it.<br> It's not a dirty word.<br> Say whatever you want.<br> The writer is king<br> at Capitol Pictures.<br> Look at your paycheck.<br> That's what<br> we think of writers.<br> So, what kind of pictures<br> does he like?<br> Mr. Fink hasn't given<br> a preference, Mr. Lipnick.<br> So, how about it, Bart?<br> Well, uh, to be honest,<br> I don't go to the pictures much.<br> That's okay.<br> You probably<br> walked in here<br> thinking that was going<br> to be a handicap,<br> thinking we wanted people<br> who knew something about the medium,<br> thinking there's technical<br> mumbo jumbo to learn.<br> You were dead wrong.<br> There's only one thing...<br> Can you tell a story?<br> Can you make us laugh,<br> make us cry,<br> make us want<br> to break out in song?<br> That more than one thing?<br> I run this dump, and I don't know<br> technical mumbo jumbo.<br> Why do I run it?<br> 'Cause I got horse sense, showmanship!<br> And also I'm bigger<br> and meaner and louder<br> than any other kike<br> in this town.<br> I don't mean my dick's<br> bigger than yours.<br> It's not a sexual thing.<br> Coffee?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Lou!<br> Used to have shares<br> in the company,<br> ownership interest,<br> got bought out...<br> muscled out.<br> We keep him around.<br> He's got a family.<br> Poor schmuck.<br> He's sensitive.<br> Don't mention the old days.<br> Hell, say whatever you want.<br> Look, barring a preference,<br> you'll be working on<br> a wrestling picture... Wallace Beery.<br> They say you know<br> the poetry of the street.<br> That rules out<br> westerns, pirates,<br> screwball, Bible, Roman...<br> I'm not some guy<br> that thinks poetic is fruity.<br> We're together on that.<br> I'm from New York myself.<br> Minsk... if you want<br> to go all the way back,<br> which we won't<br> if you don't mind.<br> People will say to you...<br> Wallace Beery, wrestling...<br> it's a B picture.<br> You tell them... bullshit!<br> We don't make B pictures<br> here at Capitol.<br> Let's put a stop<br> to that rumor right now.<br> Thanks, Lou.<br> Join us.<br> Join us.<br> We're talking about<br> the Wally Beery picture.<br> Excellent picture.<br> Got a treatment on it yet?<br> We just bought the story.<br> Saturday Evening Post.<br> The hell with the story.<br> Wally Beery's a wrestler.<br> Give me his hopes, his dreams.<br> Naturally he gets mixed up<br> with a bad element<br> and a romantic interest<br> or else an orphan.<br> Lou, think Wally's too old<br> for a romantic interest?<br> Look at me.<br> A writer in the room,<br> and I'm asking Lou<br> about the goddamn story.<br> Which is it, Bart?<br> Orphan?<br> Dame?<br> Both maybe?<br> Maybe we should do a treatment.<br> Hell!<br> Let Bart take a crack at it.<br> He'll get into the swing of things<br> or I don't know writers.<br> Let's make it a dame.<br> Keep it simple.<br> The important thing<br> is we all want it to have<br> that Barton Fink feeling.<br> We all have that feeling,<br> but since you're Barton Fink,<br> I'm assuming you have it in spades.<br> I like you.<br> If all my writers<br> were like you,<br> I wouldn't have<br> to get involved.<br> Have something<br> by the end of the week.<br> I heard about your show,<br> by the way.<br> My man in New York saw it.<br> Says it's damn moving,<br> a little fruity,<br> but I guess you know<br> what you're doing.<br> Thanks for your heart.<br> We need more heart<br> in motion pictures.<br> We're all expecting great things.<br> Front desk.<br> Hello? Uh, Chet?<br> Speaking.<br> This is Barton Fink in room 621.<br> Yes. There's, uh, someone in the room<br> next door to mine...<br> and he's, uh...<br> he's, uh...<br> making a lot of... noise.<br> I'll take care of it<br> right away, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello.<br> What?<br> Huh?<br> Who?<br> Did you...<br> Somebody just complained.<br> No. I didn't.<br> I mean, I did call down,<br> not to complain exactly.<br> I was concerned that you might...<br> not that it's my business...<br> might be in some kind of... distress.<br> See, I was trying to work,<br> and it's...<br> Well, it was... difficult.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm damned sorry<br> if I bothered you.<br> The damn walls here...<br> I just apologize like hell.<br> My name's Charlie Meadows.<br> I guess we're neighbors.<br> Barton Fink.<br> Neighbor, I'd feel better<br> about the damned inconvenience<br> if you let me buy you a drink.<br> That's all right.<br> Really.<br> Thank you.<br> All right, hell.<br> You trying to work,<br> me carrying on in there.<br> The liquor's good.<br> What do you say?<br> You got a glass?<br> It's the least I can do.<br> Okay, a quick one.<br> Sure.<br> Yeah, just a nip.<br> I sure do forget myself sometimes.<br> I feel like a heel...<br> All the carryings-on next door.<br> That's okay, I assure you.<br> It's just I was trying to work.<br> What kind of work do you do, Barton,<br> if you don't mind my asking?<br> Well, I'm a writer, actually.<br> You don't say?<br> That's a tough racket.<br> My hat's off to you.<br> Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.<br> It's not easy, but...<br> Damn difficult, I'd imagine.<br> And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?<br> Hell, no, call me Charlie.<br> Well, Barton...<br> you might say I sell peace of mind.<br> Insurance is my game.<br> Door-to-door.<br> Human contact's the only way<br> to move merchandise.<br> In spite of what you might think,<br> I'm pretty good at it.<br> It doesn't surprise me.<br> I believe in it.<br> Fire, theft, and casualty aren't things<br> that only happen to other people.<br> Writing doesn't work out,<br> you may want to look into it.<br> Providing basic needs...<br> you could do worse.<br> I'll keep that in mind.<br> What kind of scribbler are you?<br> Newspaperman did you say?<br> No. Actually, I'm writing<br> for the pictures now.<br> Pictures?<br> Jesus!<br> Aw, I'm sorry, brother.<br> I was just sitting here thinking<br> I was talking to some ambitious<br> youngster eager to make good.<br> Hell, you've got it made.<br> Beating out that competition?<br> And me being patronizing?<br> Is the egg showing or what?<br> Actually, I'm just starting out<br> in the movies,<br> though I was well established<br> in New York,<br> some renown there.<br> Oh, it's an exciting time, then.<br> I'm not the best-read mug on the planet,<br> so it's not surprising<br> I didn't recognize your name.<br> Jesus, I feel like a heel.<br> That's okay, Charlie.<br> I'm a playwright.<br> My shows have only played New York.<br> The last one got<br> a hell of a write-up.<br> Must be why they wanted me.<br> Why not?<br> Everyone wants quality.<br> What kind of venue...<br> that is to say,<br> thematically,<br> um...<br> What do I write about?<br> Caught me trying to be fancy.<br> Yeah, that's it, Bart.<br> Well, that's a good question.<br> Strange as it may seem, Charlie,<br> I write about people like you...<br> the working stiff,<br> the common man.<br> Well, ain't that<br> a kick in the head.<br> I guess it is, but in a way,<br> that's exactly the point.<br> There's a few people in New York...<br> hopefully our numbers are growing...<br> who feel we have an opportunity<br> to forge something real<br> out of everyday experience,<br> create a theater for the masses<br> based on a few simple truths,<br> not on some shopworn abstractions<br> about drama<br> that don't hold true today.<br> I don't guess this means much to you.<br> Hell, I could tell you stories.<br> And that's the point...<br> we all have stories.<br> The hopes and dreams<br> of the common man<br> are as noble as those of any king.<br> The stuff of life...<br> Why shouldn't it be<br> the stuff of theater?<br> Why should that be<br> such a hard pill to swallow?<br> Don't call it new theater, Charlie.<br> Call it real theater.<br> Call it our theater!<br> I can see you feel<br> pretty strongly about it.<br> I don't mean to get up<br> on my high horse,<br> but why shouldn't we<br> look at ourselves up there?<br> Who cares about<br> the fifth Earl of Bastrop<br> and Lady Higginbottom<br> and...<br> and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?<br> My butt's getting sore already.<br> Exactly.<br> You understand what I'm saying<br> a lot more than some<br> of these literary types<br> because you're a real man.<br> I could tell you some stories...<br> Sure, you could,<br> yet many writers insulate themselves<br> from the common man,<br> from where they live,<br> from where they trade<br> and fight and love<br> and converse and...<br> and...<br> So, naturally, their work suffers<br> and regresses into<br> empty formalism and...<br> Well, I'm spouting off again,<br> but to put it in your language...<br> the theater becomes<br> as phony as a $3 bill.<br> That's a tragedy right there.<br> You're all right, Charlie.<br> I'm glad you stopped by.<br> I know sometimes I run on.<br> Well, Christ, if there's<br> any way I can contribute<br> or help or whatever...<br> You can help by just being yourself.<br> Well, I can tell you some stories.<br> Now, look...<br> I'm sorry about<br> the interruption.<br> Too much revelry late at night,<br> you forget there's other people<br> in the world.<br> I'll be eating on the lot today.<br> Who's this?<br> Barton Fink, Mr. Geezler.<br> Geisler.<br> I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler.<br> Ted Okum said to drop by.<br> Ever act?<br> Huh? No. I'm a...<br> We need Indians<br> for a Norman Steele western.<br> I'm a writer.<br> Writers come and go.<br> We always need Indians.<br> I'm a writer.<br> Ted Okum said you're producing<br> this Wallace Beery picture.<br> Ted Okum doesn't know shit.<br> They've assigned me<br> enough pictures for a year.<br> What Ted Okum doesn't know<br> you could almost squeeze<br> into the Hollywood Bowl.<br> Who should I talk to?<br> Get me Lou Breeze.<br> Mr. Breeze's office.<br> Is he in for Mr. Geezler?<br> Geisler.<br> Lou! How's Lipnick's ass<br> smell this morning?<br> Yeah? Yeah?<br> Yeah. All right.<br> Listen.<br> I got a writer here...<br> Fink... all screwy.<br> Says I'm producing<br> that Wallace Beery wrestling picture.<br> What am I, the goddamn janitor?<br> Yeah?<br> Who'd you get that from?<br> Well, tell Lipnick<br> he can kiss my dimpled ass.<br> No, no. All right. Shit.<br> All right. No.<br> All right.<br> Okay, Fink.<br> Let's chow.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> It's just a B picture.<br> I bring it in on budget,<br> they book it without screening it.<br> Lipnick said he wanted<br> to look at the script<br> by the end of the week.<br> Sure, he did.<br> He forgot about it<br> before your ass left his sofa.<br> He forgot about it<br> before your ass left his sofa.<br> Okay.<br> I'm just having trouble<br> getting started.<br> It's funny.<br> I'm blocked up.<br> I just feel<br> like I need<br> some kind of indication<br> of what's expected.<br> Wallace Beery.<br> Wrestling picture.<br> What do you need, a road map?<br> Look,<br> you're confused.<br> You need guidance?<br> Talk to another writer.<br> Who?<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> You throw a rock in here,<br> you'll hit one.<br> Do me a favor, Fink...<br> Throw it hard.<br> Bill Mayhew.<br> Sorry about the odor.<br> Barton Fink.<br> Jesus. W.P.?<br> I beg your pardon?<br> W.P. Mayhew?<br> The writer?<br> Just Bill, please.<br> Bill!<br> You're the finest novelist<br> of our time.<br> Why, thank you, son.<br> How kind.<br> My God.<br> I had no idea<br> you were in Hollywood.<br> All of us undomesticated writers<br> eventually make our way out here<br> to the great salt lick.<br> That's probably why<br> I always have<br> such a powerful thirst.<br> A little social lubricant, Mr. Fink?<br> No. It's a little early for me.<br> Bill...<br> if I'm imposing,<br> you should say so.<br> I know you're very busy.<br> I just wanted to ask...<br> you a favor.<br> Have you ever written<br> a wrestling picture?<br> You are drippin', sir.<br> They have not invented<br> a genre of picture<br> that Bill Mayhew has not<br> at one time or other<br> been invited to assay.<br> Yes, I've taken my stab<br> at the wrestling form,<br> as I have stabbed<br> at so many others.<br> Well, how do you...<br> I gather you're a freshman here,<br> eager for an upperclassman's counsel.<br> However, just at the moment<br> I have drinking to do.<br> Why don't you stop<br> by my bungalow, number 15,<br> later on this afternoon?<br> We will discuss wrestling scenarios<br> and other things literary.<br> Sons of bitches!<br> Sons of bitches!<br> Where's honey?<br> Huh?<br> Honey!<br> Where's my honey?<br> The water's lapping up on me, honey!<br> Honey, just stop it.<br> I can't.<br> I'm trying to help you.<br> Ohh!<br> Can I help you?<br> I'm sorry. I...<br> Where are you, damn it?<br> My name is Fink.<br> Bill asked me to drop by<br> this afternoon.<br> Is he, uh...<br> Honey!<br> In?<br> Oooh!<br> Mr. Mayhew is indisposed<br> at the moment.<br> Where's my honey?<br> Is he, uh...<br> Honey!<br> Is he okay?<br> He'll be fine.<br> Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor,<br> Mr. Mayhew's personal secretary.<br> Where's my honey?<br> I know this all must sound horrid.<br> I really do apologize.<br> Where are you, damn it?<br> When he can't write, he drinks.<br> It's so embarrassing.<br> How about you?<br> Will you be all right?<br> I'll be fine.<br> Are you a writer, Mr. Fink?<br> Yes. I'm working on a wrestling...<br> Please call me Barton.<br> I'll tell Bill you dropped by.<br> I'm sure he'll want to reschedule<br> your appointment.<br> Perhaps you and I can get together<br> at some point also.<br> Sorry if that sounds abrupt.<br> I just...<br> I... I don't know anyone here in town.<br> Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.<br> Please. Barton.<br> Barton.<br> You see, Barton,<br> I'm not just Bill's secretary.<br> Bill and I are...<br> in love.<br> Where's my honey?<br> Look, I know this must look...<br> Funny.<br> Bastard-ass sons of bitches!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Please don't judge us, Mr. Fink.<br> Where's that woman?<br> Bastard-ass sons of bitches!<br> The water's lapping up!<br> Oh, honey!<br> Oh...<br> Oh...<br> Oh...<br> Oh...<br> Ah...<br> Oh...<br> Oh...<br> Oh...<br> Ah...<br> Howdy, neighbor.<br> Charlie. How are you?<br> Oh, Jesus, I hope<br> I'm not interrupting you again.<br> Heard you walking around in here.<br> Figured I'd drop by.<br> Yeah. Come on in.<br> Have a seat.<br> I haven't really gotten started yet.<br> What happened to your ear?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> An ear infection.<br> Chronic thing.<br> Goes away for a while,<br> then it comes back.<br> I got cotton in it<br> to staunch the pus.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's not contagious.<br> You seen a doctor?<br> What's he going to tell me?<br> Can't trade my head<br> for a new one.<br> I guess you're stuck<br> with the one you got.<br> I'd invite you to my place,<br> but it's a goddamn mess.<br> You married, Bart?<br> No.<br> I myself have yet<br> to be lassoed.<br> Hey, Bart.<br> Ouch.<br> Got a sweetheart?<br> No.<br> I guess it's something<br> about my work.<br> I get so worked up over it.<br> I don't have much attention left over,<br> so it would be a little... unfair.<br> Yeah. Ladies do ask for attention.<br> In my experience,<br> they pretend to give it,<br> but it's generally a smoke screen<br> for demanding it back with interest.<br> How about family, Bart?<br> How you fixed in that department?<br> My folks live in Brooklyn<br> with my uncle.<br> Mine have passed on.<br> It's just us three now.<br> What's that expression?<br> Me, myself, and I.<br> Sure.<br> That's tough.<br> But in a sense,<br> we're all alone in the world,<br> aren't we, Charlie?<br> I'm often surrounded<br> by family and friends,<br> but...<br> You're no stranger<br> to loneliness, then.<br> I guess I got no beef,<br> especially where the dames<br> are concerned.<br> In my line of work,<br> I got opportunities galore.<br> I could tell you stories<br> to curl your hair,<br> but it looks like you've<br> already heard them.<br> That's me in Kansas City<br> plying my trade.<br> That was taken by<br> one of my policyholders.<br> They're more than just customers<br> to me, Barton.<br> They appreciate<br> what I have to offer.<br> Her hubby was out of town,<br> and they were carrying<br> fire and life.<br> The third quarter payment<br> was way past due.<br> In a way, I envy you...<br> your daily routine,<br> you know what's expected.<br> You know the drill.<br> My job is to plumb the depths,<br> so to speak.<br> Dredge up something from inside,<br> something honest.<br> I got to tell you,<br> the life of the mind...<br> There's no road map<br> for that territory.<br> And exploring it<br> can be painful.<br> I have pain most people<br> don't know anything about.<br> This must be boring you.<br> Not at all.<br> It's damned interesting.<br> Yeah.<br> Probably sounds a little grand<br> for someone who's writing<br> a wrestling picture<br> for Wallace Beery.<br> Beery?<br> You got no beef there.<br> He's a hell of an actor,<br> though you can't beatJack Oakie.<br> A stitch, Oakie.<br> Funny stuff, funny stuff.<br> But don't get me wrong.<br> Beery? Wrestling picture?<br> Could be a pip.<br> Could be a pip.<br> Wrestled myself some back in school.<br> I guess you know the basic moves.<br> No. I never watched any.<br> I'm not interested in the act.<br> Hell, you should know<br> what it's about.<br> I can show you<br> the wrestling basics in 30 seconds.<br> You're a little<br> out of your weight class,<br> but just for demonstration purposes...<br> That's all right.<br> Not a bit of it, compadre.<br> Easiest thing in the world.<br> Just get on your knees<br> to my left here.<br> Slap your right hand here,<br> your left hand here.<br> Come on, champ.<br> You can do it. Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Yeah. There you go.<br> Right there.<br> All right.<br> Now, when I say, "Ready, wrestle,"<br> we try to pin each other.<br> That's the whole game.<br> Got it?<br> Yeah. Okay.<br> Ready? Wrestle.<br> Oh!<br> Damn. There I go again.<br> Going to wake up<br> the downstairs neighbors.<br> I didn't hurt you, did I?<br> It's okay.<br> Well, that's all wrestling is.<br> Usually there's<br> more grunting and squirming<br> before the pin.<br> Well, you're out of your weight class.<br> Jesus, I did hurt you.<br> I sure do apologize.<br> I'm just a big, clumsy lug.<br> I sure do apologize.<br> You sure you're okay?<br> I'm fine, really.<br> Actually, it's been helpful.<br> But I guess I should get to work.<br> It wasn't fair of me to do that.<br> I'm pretty well-endowed physically.<br> Don't feel bad, though.<br> I wouldn't be<br> much of a match for you<br> at mental gymnastics.<br> Give me a holler<br> you need anything.<br> If I close my eyes,<br> I can almost smell the live oak.<br> That's chicken fat, Bill.<br> Well, my olfactory's<br> turning womanish on me...<br> lying and deceitful.<br> Still, I must say I haven't<br> felt peace like this<br> since the grand productive days.<br> Don't you find it so, Barton?<br> Ain't writing peace?<br> Well...<br> actually...<br> no, Bill.<br> No. I've always found<br> that writing comes<br> from a great inner pain.<br> Maybe it's a pain<br> that comes from a realization<br> that one must do something<br> for one's fellow man<br> to help somehow ease the suffering.<br> Maybe it's personal pain.<br> At any rate, I don't believe<br> good work is possible without it.<br> Hmm.<br> Well, me, I just enjoy<br> making things up.<br> Yes, sir. Escape.<br> It's when I can't write<br> and escape myself,<br> that I want to rip my head off<br> and run screaming through the street<br> with my balls<br> in a fruit picker's pail.<br> Hmm.<br> This will sometimes help.<br> That doesn't help anything, Bill.<br> I've never found that<br> to help my writing.<br> Your writing?<br> Son, have you ever heard<br> the story of Solomon's mammy?<br> Barton, you should read this.<br> I think it's Bill's finest,<br> or among his finest, anyway.<br> So now I'm supposed to roll over<br> and get my belly scratched?<br> Bill.<br> Look, uh...<br> maybe it's none of my business,<br> but don't you think<br> a man with your talent...<br> your first obligation<br> is to your gift?<br> Shouldn't you be doing<br> whatever you have to<br> to work again?<br> What would that be?<br> I don't know.<br> But with that drink,<br> you're cutting yourself<br> off from your gift<br> and your fellow man<br> and everything your art is about.<br> Oh, no, son.<br> I'm building a levee...<br> gulp by gulp,<br> brick by brick...<br> Putting up a levee<br> to keep that raging river of manure<br> from lapping at my door.<br> Maybe you better, too, Barton,<br> before you get buried<br> under his manure.<br> My honey pretends<br> to be impatient with me,<br> but she'll put up with anything.<br> Not anything, Bill.<br> Don't test me.<br> You're lucky she puts up with you<br> as much as she does.<br> Maybe to a schoolboy's eyes.<br> People who know about<br> the human heart, though,<br> maybe they'd say,<br> "Bill over here,<br> he gives his honey love,<br> and she pays him back with pity,<br> the basest coin there is."<br> Stop it, Bill.<br> Gone are the days<br> When my heart was young and gay<br> Gone are my friends<br> From the cotton fields away<br> Gone from the earth<br> To a better land I know<br> I hear their gentle voices<br> Callin'Old Black Joe<br> I'm comin'<br> I'm comin'<br> Oh, my head is bending low<br> I hear their gentle...<br> The truth, my honey, is a tart<br> that does not bear scrutiny.<br> Breach my levee at your peril!<br> Gone are my friends<br> From the cotton fields...<br> That son of a bitch!<br> Don't get me wrong.<br> He's a fine writer.<br> Gone from the earth<br> Are you all right?<br> To a better life I know<br> Audrey, y-you can't...<br> Oh, Barton.<br> You can't put up with that.<br> Old Black Joe<br> I feel so sorry for him.<br> What? He's... He's a son of a bitch.<br> No.<br> No.<br> He...<br> He sometimes just...<br> I hear their angel voices...<br> Well, he thinks about Estelle.<br> His wife still lives<br> in Fayettesville.<br> She's...<br> disturbed.<br> Really?<br> I'll just walk on down<br> to the Pacific,<br> and from there I'll improvise.<br> He'll wander back<br> when he's sober<br> and apologize.<br> He always does.<br> Okay, but that doesn't excuse his...<br> Silence upon the hill...<br> behavior.<br> In Darien!<br> Empathy requires understanding.<br> I'm comin'<br> What?<br> What don't I understand?<br> I'm comin'<br> Oh, my head is hangin'low<br> I hear their gentle voices<br> Callin'Old Black Joe<br> I hope these are your shoes.<br> Charlie.<br> Because that would mean...<br> they gave you mine.<br> Yeah.<br> As a matter of fact, they did.<br> Come on in.<br> Jesus, what a day I had.<br> Ever have one of those days?<br> Seems like nothing but lately.<br> Jesus, what a day.<br> Felt like I couldn't have sold<br> ice water in the Sahara.<br> Okay. So you don't want insurance.<br> Okay. So that's your loss.<br> But, God, people can be rude.<br> I feel like I have to talk<br> to a normal person like you<br> just to restore a little of my...<br> It's my pleasure.<br> I could use a little lift myself.<br> A little lift? Yeah.<br> Good thing they bottle it, huh, pal?<br> Did I say rude?<br> People can be goddamn cruel,<br> especially some of these housewives.<br> Okay.<br> So I have a weight problem.<br> That's my cross to bear.<br> I don't know.<br> It's a defense mechanism.<br> Defense against what, insurance?<br> Something they need?<br> Something they should be<br> grateful to me for offering?<br> A little peace of mind.<br> Finally decided<br> to knock off early.<br> Went to see a doctor about this.<br> He told me I had an ear infection.<br> $10, please.<br> I says, "Hell, I told you<br> my ear was infected.<br> Why don't you give me $10?"<br> Well, that led to an argument.<br> Listen to me bellyaching,<br> as if my problems amounted<br> to a hill of beans.<br> How goes the life of the mind?<br> Well, it's been better.<br> I can't seem to get going<br> on this thing.<br> That one idea,<br> the one that lets you get started,<br> I still haven't gotten it.<br> Maybe I only had one idea in me...<br> my play.<br> Maybe once that was done,<br> I was done being a writer.<br> Christ, I feel like a fraud,<br> sitting here staring at this paper.<br> Those two lovebirds next door<br> driving you nuts?<br> How do you know about that?<br> Know about it?<br> I can practically see<br> how they're doing it.<br> Brother, I wish I had<br> a piece of that.<br> Seems like I hear everything<br> that goes on in this dump...<br> the pipes or something.<br> Yeah, but...<br> You'll lick this picture business.<br> You got a head on your shoulders.<br> What do they say?<br> Where there's a head, there's hope.<br> Where there's life, there's hope.<br> See, that proves<br> you really are a writer.<br> There's hope for you, too, Charlie.<br> Tomorrow I bet you sell<br> a half-dozen policies.<br> Thanks, brother, but the fact is<br> I got to pull up stakes for a while.<br> You're leaving?<br> In a few days.<br> Out to your stomping grounds...<br> New York City.<br> Things got all balled up<br> at the head office.<br> I'm truly sorry to hear that.<br> I'll miss you.<br> Well, hell, buddy.<br> Don't pull a long face.<br> I keep a room here,<br> and I'll be back sooner or later.<br> And mark my words,<br> by the time I get back,<br> your picture will be finished.<br> New York can be<br> pretty cruel to strangers.<br> If you need a home-cooked meal,<br> you just look up<br> Sam and Lillian Fink.<br> They live on Fulton Street...<br> with my uncle Maury.<br> Christ.<br> Your room does that, too.<br> I guess the heat's<br> sweating off the wallpaper.<br> What a dump.<br> I guess this must seem pretty pathetic<br> to a guy like you.<br> Well...<br> But it's pathetic, isn't it?<br> I mean, to a guy from New York?<br> What do you mean?<br> This kind of heat.<br> It's pathetic.<br> Well, I guess<br> you pick your poison.<br> So they say.<br> Don't pick up and leave<br> without saying good-bye.<br> 'Course not, compadre.<br> You'll see me again.<br> Zing! Bango!<br> You're dead.<br> You're a corpse.<br> You got me.<br> Okay, go, go, you son of a gun.<br> Yeah, Fink.<br> Come on, come on.<br> What do you got for me?<br> What the hell happened to your face?<br> Nothing.<br> It's just a mosquito bite.<br> There are no mosquitoes<br> in Los Angeles.<br> Mosquitoes breed in swamps.<br> This is a desert.<br> What do you got for me?<br> Well, I...<br> On the Beery picture, where are we?<br> Well, I'm having a little trouble<br> getting started.<br> Getting start...<br> ChristJesus, started?<br> You don't have anything yet?<br> Well, not much.<br> What the hell do you<br> think this is, Hamlet,<br> Gone With the Wind,<br> Ruggles of Red Gap?<br> It's a goddamn B picture...<br> big men in tights...<br> you know the drill.<br> I don't really understand that genre.<br> Maybe that's the problem.<br> Understand? Shit!<br> You were going to consult<br> another writer on this.<br> Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew.<br> Mayhew? Some help.<br> The guy's a souse.<br> He's a great writer.<br> A great souse!<br> He's in pain<br> because he can't write.<br> Souse! Souse!<br> He manages to write his name<br> on the back<br> of his paycheck every week.<br> I thought no one cared<br> about this picture.<br> You thought?<br> I don't know<br> what the hell you said to Lipnick,<br> but the son of a bitch likes you.<br> He's taken a interest.<br> Never make Lipnick like you.<br> Never!<br> I... I don't understand.<br> Are you deaf?<br> He likes you.<br> What the hell did you say to him?<br> Nothing.<br> Well, he's taken a interest.<br> He'll make your life hell.<br> Since I drew the short straw<br> to supervise this turkey,<br> he'll be all over me, too.<br> Fat-ass son of a bitch called yesterday<br> to ask how it's going.<br> I said you were making progress.<br> We were all very excited.<br> I told him it was great.<br> Understand that?<br> Now my ass is on the line.<br> He wants you to tell him<br> all about it tomorrow.<br> I can't write anything by tomorrow.<br> Who said write?<br> Jesus, Jack can't read.<br> You got to tell it to him.<br> Tell him something,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> Well, what do I t-tell him?<br> Yes, Mr. Geezler.<br> Projection!<br> Jerry.<br> Jerry, Ben Geisler here.<br> Any screening rooms free?<br> Good! Book it for me.<br> I got a writer here.<br> He's coming in.<br> You're going to show him<br> wrestling pictures.<br> I don't give a shit which ones!<br> Isn't Victor Sjoderberg<br> shooting one now?<br> Show him some dailies on that.<br> Okay, Ben.<br> All right.<br> This will give you some ideas.<br> at Lipnick's house.<br> Ideas.<br> Broad strokes.<br> Don't cross me, Fink.<br> Devil on the Can...<br> Devil on the Canvas,<br> Action!<br> I will destroy him!<br> Cut!

I'm sorry.<br> It's Barton Fink.<br> Barton, I'm afraid<br> it's not a good time.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I just feel like I need...<br> I know I shouldn't ask.<br> I just need some kind of help.<br> I have a deadline tomorrow.<br> All right, Barton.<br> I'll see if I can slip away.<br> Oh, if you could...<br> If I can.<br> He... He gets jealous.<br> I need help, Audrey.<br> I'll try to slip out<br> if he quiets down, passes out.<br> I'm afraid he thinks...<br> Well, he said you were<br> a buffoon, Barton.<br> Uh-huh.<br> He becomes irrational.<br> Uh-huh, uh-huh.<br> I'll try and slip away.<br> Who is that?<br> Audrey, thank you for coming.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello, Barton.<br> I'm sorry to be...<br> such a... such a...<br> Thank you.<br> That's all right, Barton.<br> Everything's going to be all right.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> How's Bill?<br> Oh, he's, uh...<br> He drifted off.<br> He'll sleep for a while now.<br> What is it you have to do exactly?<br> Well, I have to come up<br> with an outline,<br> I guess you call it,<br> the whole goddamn story,<br> soup to nuts, three acts,<br> the whole goddamn...<br> That's all right, Barton.<br> You don't have to write<br> actual scenes.<br> No, but the whole goddamn...<br> Audrey...<br> have you ever read<br> any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?<br> Yes, I'm afraid I have.<br> What are they like?<br> What are they about?<br> Well...<br> usually they're simple morality tales.<br> There's a good wrestler<br> and a bad wrestler,<br> whom he confronts at the end.<br> In between, the good wrestler<br> has a love interest<br> or a small child he has to protect.<br> Bill would usually make<br> the good wrestler<br> a backwards type or a convict,<br> and sometimes, instead of a waif,<br> he'd have the wrestler<br> protecting an idiot man-child.<br> The studio always hated that.<br> Some of the scripts were so...<br> spirited.<br> Barton, look,<br> it's really just a formula.<br> You don't have to type<br> your soul into it.<br> We'll invent some names<br> and a new setting.<br> I'll help you.<br> It won't take any time at all.<br> I did it for Bill so many times.<br> You did what for Bill?<br> Well... this.<br> You wrote his scripts for him?<br> Well, the basic ideas<br> were frequently his.<br> You wrote Bill's scripts?<br> Jesus, you wrote his...<br> Well, what about before that?<br> Before what?<br> Before Bill came to Hollywood.<br> Bill was always the author,<br> so to speak.<br> What do you mean, "so to speak"?<br> Audrey, how long have you been his...<br> secretary?<br> Let's concentrate<br> on our little project.<br> I want to know how many<br> of Bill's books you wrote!<br> I want to know!<br> Barton, honestly...<br> Only the last couple.<br> Hah!<br> And my input was<br> mostly editorial, really,<br> after he had been drinking.<br> I'll bet.<br> Jesus, "the grand productive days"!<br> What a goddamn phony.<br> W.P. Mayhew...<br> William goddamn Phony Mayhew!<br> All his guff about escape!<br> I'll say he escaped!<br> We don't have much time.<br> It'll be fine.<br> Don't judge him, Barton.<br> Don't condescend to him.<br> I help Bill most<br> by understanding him,<br> by appreciating him.<br> We all need understanding, Barton...<br> even you tonight.<br> It's all you really need.<br> Aah!<br> Aah!<br> Aah!<br> Barton?<br> Barton, are you all right?<br> I'm fine, thanks.<br> You sure?<br> No! No.<br> Barton. Are you all right?<br> No. Can I come in?<br> Let's go to your room.<br> Charlie, I'm in trouble.<br> You got to help me.<br> Get a grip on yourself, brother.<br> Whatever the problem is,<br> we can sort it out.<br> Charlie, I'm in trouble.<br> Something horrible's happened.<br> I got to call the police.<br> Will you stay with me<br> till they get here?<br> Don't worry about it.<br> We can work it out.<br> Before you go in...<br> I didn't do this.<br> I don't know how it happened, but...<br> I didn't.<br> I want you to know that.<br> Okay.<br> Ohhh!<br> Oh...<br> Oh...<br> Jesus, Barton,<br> what the hell is this?<br> What are we going to do?<br> Call the police.<br> Hold on.<br> I didn't do this.<br> I did not do this!<br> Hold on!<br> Stop.<br> Take a deep breath.<br> Tell me what happened.<br> I passed out! I don't know!<br> Won't the police...<br> Stop with the police!<br> Wake up!<br> This looks bad!<br> They hang people for this!<br> But I didn't do it.<br> Don't you believe me?<br> I believe you!

Talk.<br> Relax for a minute.<br> Then talk.<br> Drink?<br> Uh...<br> yeah.<br> Rye whiskey?<br> Boy, you writers.<br> Work hard, play hard.<br> That's what I hear, anyway.<br> Lou!<br> Anyway, Ben Geisler tells me things<br> are going along great.<br> Says we got a real winner<br> in this one.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> I'm counting on it.<br> I've taken an interest.<br> Nothing to fear, mind you.<br> Hardly seems necessary in your case...<br> a writer,<br> a storyteller of your stature.<br> Give it to me<br> in bold strokes, Bart.<br> Give me the broad outlines.<br> I'm in the audience,<br> the lights go down,<br> Capitol logo comes up.<br> You're on, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Uh... okay.<br> Huh?<br> Well, uh...<br> we... we fade in...<br> Uh-huh.<br> It's...

I'd just as soon<br> not talk about it.<br> Mr. Fink... never mind me.<br> Never mind how long<br> I've been in pictures.<br> Mr. Lipnick's been in pictures<br> about since they was invented.<br> He practically invented them.<br> I think if he's interested<br> in what one of<br> his contract employees is doing,<br> that employee<br> should be able to tell him<br> if he wants to stay an employee.<br> Right now,<br> the contents of your head<br> are the property<br> of Capitol Pictures.<br> If I was you...<br> I would speak up.<br> And pretty goddamn fast.<br> You lousy kike...<br> son of a bitch.<br> You're telling this man...<br> this artist...<br> what to do?<br> Mr. Lipnick, I...<br> He creates for a living!<br> Thank him, you son of a bitch,<br> or you're fired!<br> Mr. Lipnick,<br> that's really not necessary.<br> Get down on your knees,<br> you son of a bitch!<br> Kiss this man's feet!<br> Mr. Lipnick, please.<br> Kiss this man's feet!<br> Get out of here!<br> You understand me?<br> You're out of here. You're fired.<br> Get out of my sight.<br> I...<br> I apologize, Barton.<br> No. Mr. Breeze actually<br> has been a great help.<br> You don't have to cover for him.<br> That's very noble.<br> I'd feel much better<br> if you'd just reconsider.<br> If that son of a bitch<br> won't apologize to you,<br> then goddamn it, I will.<br> I respect your artistry<br> and your methods.<br> If you can't fill us in yet,<br> hell, we should be kissing your feet<br> for your fine efforts.<br> You know...<br> in the old country,<br> we were taught as young children<br> that there's no shame<br> in supplicating yourself<br> when you respect someone.<br> On behalf of Capitol Pictures,<br> the administration,<br> and all of the stockholders,<br> please accept this<br> as a symbol of<br> our apology and respect.<br> Barton, can I come in?<br> Jesus... you're leaving?<br> Have to, old-timer,<br> just for a little while.<br> Jesus.<br> Charlie, I...<br> Everything's okay, believe me.<br> I know it's rough mentally,<br> but everything's been taken care of.<br> Charlie, I got no one else here.<br> You're the only person<br> I know in Los Angeles<br> that I...<br> that I can talk to.<br> I feel like I'm...<br> like I'm losing my mind,<br> like I'm going crazy.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I didn't do it, believe me.<br> I... I'm sure of that, Charlie.<br> You got to get a grip on, brother.<br> You got to carry on till I get back.<br> Try and stay here.<br> Don't talk to anyone.<br> We got to keep our heads,<br> and we'll figure it out.<br> Okay, but...<br> Don't argue.<br> You asked me to believe you and I do.<br> Now, don't argue with me.<br> Look, pal,<br> can you do something for me?<br> Keep that for me<br> till I get back.<br> It's just a lot of personal stuff,<br> but I don't want<br> to drag it with me.<br> Funny, huh?<br> When everything<br> that's important to a guy,<br> everything he wants to keep<br> from a lifetime,<br> and he can fit it all<br> into a little box like that.<br> I guess...<br> I guess it's pretty pathetic.<br> It's more than I've got.<br> Well, keep it for me.<br> Maybe it'll bring you good luck.<br> It'll help you finish your script.<br> You'll think about me.<br> Make me your wrestler.<br> Then you'll lick that story.<br> Thanks, Charlie.<br> Yeah, yeah, sure.<br> I'll see you soon, friend.<br> You'll be fine.<br> And you'll be back?<br> Don't worry about that, compadre.<br> I'll be back.<br> You read the Bible, Pete?<br> Holy Bible?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I think so.<br> Anyway, I've heard about it.<br> Fink?<br> Yeah.<br> Detective Mastrionotti.<br> Detective Deutsch.<br> L.A.P.D.<br> Uh-huh.<br> Got some questions<br> we want to ask you.<br> Just routine.<br> Sit down.<br> What do you do, Fink?<br> I...
