                        To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!<br> Forward! To the right flank, freeze!<br> Forward! Platoon, halt.<br> At ease.<br> What was that number in Paris?<br> All heads up. Right face.<br> Forward march.<br> Extend. Hut!<br> Swing right. Hut!<br> "Merry Christmas." That's a crock.<br> Beats those replacement camps.<br> You said the war would be over<br> by Christmas.<br> What do you want, egg in your beer?<br> Here we are, two hours from Paris.<br> The spitting image<br> of Camp Wolters, Texas.<br> You know, they got a man in the army.<br> A two-star general.<br> But all he does is fly around<br> in a private plane looking for ugly places.<br> Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.<br> Then he checks up on the climate.<br> If it's too hot in summer for human life<br> and too cold in winter...<br> and if it has more rain, fog, wind,<br> and snow...<br> than any other spot he can find,<br> then he plants the American flag...<br> and proclaims it a US Army camp.<br> Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?<br> Bombshell.<br> Box steps.<br> To the rear, freeze! Forward!<br> To the right flank, freeze!<br> Forward! Platoon, halt!<br> At ease!<br> Forty-two sixty what?<br> - Forty-two sixty-ten.<br> - Seventy!<br> Platoon, attention. Right face.<br> Forward march!<br> The Screaming Eagle.<br> They know who you are<br> when you wear that on your sleeve.<br> It wasn't bad enough<br> being in Infantry Replacement.<br> We have to volunteer<br> for the 101st Airborne.<br> You go in gliders instead of trucks.<br> That's the only difference.<br> There must be a difference<br> or they wouldn't give you extra pay.<br> Hooper, I don't think<br> I'll take in that movie tonight.<br> I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted<br> and sewing on shoulder patches.<br> Why did they have to put us<br> in different companies?<br> - Lf we ask them, they might do something.<br> - No. There's another major general.<br> His job is to find out who your buddy is<br> and then to split you up.<br> - Don't forget, I'm in K Company.<br> - I won't.<br> And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.<br> Third platoon, second squad.<br> So long, Hooper.<br> Thanks.<br> Remember that lieutenant in Normandy...<br> who said he'd court-martial the first man<br> who tossed his gas mask away?<br> We ripped out the masks...<br> and used the carriers<br> for toting that cognac we liberated.<br> "Take care of that gas mask, soldier.<br> It might save your life someday."<br> - Hiya. How did you make out?<br> - The lights were pretty bad...<br> but I was really flipping them in there.<br> Six completed passes.<br> - I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.<br> - Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?<br> Him? He'd rather play football than eat.<br> With the chow we've been getting,<br> I don't blame him. But Paris...<br> It's gonna be lonesome here.<br> The whole platoon's going.<br> All except the replacements.<br> - Sgt. Wolowicz?<br> - Yeah?<br> My name is Layton.<br> I've been assigned to your squad.<br> Make yourself at home,<br> but on some other sack.<br> - That one's mine.<br> - I'm sorry, I didn't know.<br> Li'I Abner in Paris.<br> Boy, that's gonna be something.<br> Daisy Mae won't know you<br> when you get back to Dogpatch.<br> That's for dang sure.<br> Abner, will you please stop saying that?<br> Fellows, look what I found.<br> - Holley.<br> - The Purple Heart kid.<br> At ease, men.<br> I heard the war was on its last legs,<br> so I thought I'd come back.<br> Rough in the ETO.<br> A little scratch on his leg...<br> and a month later he comes back in time<br> for a three-day pass to Paris.<br> It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.<br> Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.<br> And me brooding all the time<br> about my dear buddies back there...<br> defending the Republic.<br> Will you look at that girl bait.<br> I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad<br> just as soon as we hit Paris.<br> You can have the sack next to me.<br> Nobody's got it, have they?<br> No, I was just sitting here.<br> - That's a nice-looking little girl.<br> - It's a boy.<br> What's it like, Holley?<br> - Paris?<br> - Yeah.<br> I spent my spare time in the art galleries.<br> But I happened to hear about a place<br> that might interest you. Place Pigalle.<br> Pig Alley.<br> Be sure to bring your dog tags,<br> because one night in Pig Alley...<br> Excuse me.<br> Because you're going to think<br> you're the Caliph of Baghdad.<br> You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.<br> Compared to Pig Alley,<br> it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.<br> How about you and me<br> boarding up in Paris?<br> What's the matter,<br> did Pop Stazak disown you?<br> Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.<br> I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.<br> But I'm getting me a private room<br> and private bath in Paris...<br> if I have to get it at the point of a gun.<br> The big brain wants to get away<br> from us common people.<br> He hasn't got anybody around here<br> to chat with about the Einstein Theory.<br> What do you mean? He's got me.<br> There ain't nothing<br> we like to talk about better.<br> What happened to Lt. Belwick?<br> He was just your speed, Joe College.<br> He got hit in Holland.<br> It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.<br> Just brush me off when you're through.<br> - Holley, my boy, bonjour.<br> - Hiya. What are you busting out about?<br> It's nothing at all, son.<br> It's hardly worth mentioning.<br> They're just making me a civilian,<br> that's all.<br> - They what?<br> - I wish I had arthritis.<br> It ain't the arthritis.<br> They got a report from the Red Cross...<br> that my wife is too sick<br> to take care of the kids.<br> So I let them talk me into accepting<br> a dependency discharge.<br> Glad you made it, Pop.<br> Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?<br> He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.<br> One of these days<br> you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie...<br> right square in those GI teeth.<br> Such language. You should have<br> learned him better manners, Pop.<br> - Knock it off, will you?<br> - When do you leave?<br> Any day now. I have to sweat out<br> a letter of confirmation...<br> from our higher headquarters.<br> You'll be in Paris.<br> No, I decided to catch that football game.<br> That's swell. It'll be rugged<br> waiting around here all alone.<br> See you in the morning, Johnny.<br> You gonna miss me, Abner?<br> That's for dang sure.<br> I'm glad to see you guys<br> finally got the junk off my cot.<br> How about dousing that light?<br> Paris trucks are leaving early.<br> Okay, douse it.<br> All right, roll out of them sacks.<br> Hit it.<br> Leave your cots and grab your socks.<br> Let's go, men. You're slow.<br> Get them up, Wolowicz.<br> - I ain't going to Paris.<br> - Nobody's going to Paris.<br> - We're moving up. On trucks.<br> - Moving up? Where to?<br> Beats me. The Krauts<br> made a breakthrough someplace.<br> They tell me it's gonna be cold...<br> so wear your long johns and two pairs<br> of pants. Three, if you can get them on.<br> But they told us yesterday<br> we'd be off the line for good.<br> They didn't get the order<br> till after midnight.<br> There's trucks this time instead of gliders.<br> That's a good sign, anyway.<br> This is strictly for the birds, brother.<br> Beats anything<br> ever I stuck my finger in before.<br> "General, I need a crack division<br> to plug up that gap."<br> "A crack division, General?<br> I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."<br> "Awfully nice of you, old boy.<br> Thanks a lot."<br> "Not at all, General."<br> Maybe the adjutant<br> can put in a phone call.<br> Yeah. It's only a technicality.<br> - I forgot to tell you, men...<br> - Shut up!<br> It's a secret move,<br> so rip off your shoulder patches.<br> Sarge, you got any of them<br> rubber overshoes, them galoshes?<br> Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.<br> Take care of that gas mask, soldier.<br> It might save your life someday.<br> Yeah, if you can find some cognac.<br> - No dice?<br> - I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.<br> It's gonna be a cold trip.<br> Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.<br> Wind it up.<br> Let's get this show on the road.<br> - That the new platoon leader?<br> - Yeah, fresh off the boat.<br> I understand your problems, men.<br> - I used to be an enlisted man myself.<br> - For six months, maybe.<br> And 17 weeks at OCS,<br> and he's an officer and gentleman...<br> - by special act of Congress.<br> - Sound off!<br> Shut up!<br> - What did he say? Where are we?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> Do you speak French, sir?<br> Yes. Immediately.<br> - Cigarette?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> What time is it, Hansan?<br> - 11:30.<br> - What?<br> It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.<br> - Near lunchtime in Springfield.<br> - You never changed your watch?<br> What's the use of changing your watch?<br> What's the use? You're here,<br> you're not in Springfield, Illinois.<br> I hear you.<br> This is what I like about the infantry.<br> You always know just what's going on.<br> How do you like this guy?<br> He don't like the infantry.<br> - Must be off his nut.<br> - He never had it so good.<br> He found a home in the Army.<br> Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?<br> Chocolate, please.<br> Isn't she cute?<br> Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?<br> Here.<br> Get a load of mama!<br> I'd like to keep her in chocolate<br> for about a week.<br> What's she saying, Jarvess?<br> She wants to know<br> if we'd like to come inside and warm up.<br> - Yes. Warm up, please.<br> - Oh, brother!<br> - I like these secret moves.<br> - We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.<br> How do they find out these things?<br> Who tells them?<br> - I keep them posted. Short wave.<br> - Somebody does.<br> They only occupied France for four years.<br> Naturally they left a few spies<br> when they pulled out.<br> That's an idea.<br> Why don't us Gls hire some spies...<br> so we'll know what's going on<br> once in a while?<br> Get them inside! Come on!<br> On the double!<br> Kinnie, how about getting<br> these men in out of the hot sun?<br> Wolowicz, Garby,<br> in there with the second platoon.<br> This corner house.<br> I forgot to tell you.<br> Put those shoulder patches back on.<br> - Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.<br> - Overnight?<br> Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.<br> Smoke coming out of the chimney.<br> For once, we get a break.<br> Bastogne. I won't be forgetting<br> this place in a hurry.<br> I wouldn't mind holing up here<br> till Christmas.<br> I hear tell we might.<br> All the rumors is good ones.<br> This is the United States Armed Forces<br> Radio Service broadcasting from London.<br> Let's see if we can get some news.<br> - What's he selling?<br> - Wait till he slows down.<br> Ask her. I'll guarantee you<br> she can sprechen sie Deutsch.<br> Let's live a little, Jarvess.<br> - Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.<br> - No, not mama.<br> These two little children,<br> they live with me, but...<br> Slowly, please.<br> She said she's not the mother<br> of the two little girls.<br> They're from a town near here.<br> Bombed out, both parents killed.<br> They all got a sob story.<br> - Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?<br> - No, we've cut enough.<br> You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.<br> Fork over another chocolate bar.<br> What you say, please?<br> I said do you think<br> the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?<br> What he say?<br> Is there any coffee left?<br> - Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.<br> - Thank you.<br> Anything you want.<br> Sure, as long as you pay for it.<br> They're all alike here.<br> Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.<br> Scared, hungry, lonely.<br> Come on, stop beating your gums.<br> Let a guy get some sleep.<br> Yeah, it's about that time.<br> We sure come a far piece today.<br> - You okay, Kipp?<br> - Okay.<br> Poor tired soldiers.<br> - You want?<br> - Thank you.<br> I go now?<br> I guess so. I'm all beat-up.<br> It never fails.<br> Every time you meet a pretty babe...<br> you're either out on your feet<br> or you get the order to move.<br> - What you say, please?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - All right.<br> Good night.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Guard.<br> What did she say?<br> She said she's gonna hide the chocolate<br> from the kids till Christmas.<br> I wish I knew for sure<br> we'd be here tomorrow.<br> - You'll be here.<br> - Are you sure?<br> All we do is lie around till the fog lifts...<br> so the air corps can come out<br> and win the war for us.<br> In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.<br> This may go down in history<br> as the greatest gamble of the war.<br> - Good night, Denise.<br> - Good night, soldier.<br> Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?<br> Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.<br> Wake me up early, will you?<br> Maybe.<br> I ought to report this<br> to the Inspector General.<br> There's supposed to be 18 inches<br> between bunks.<br> This is dangerous, spreads germs.<br> There's some hot coffee on the stove.<br> I can use it.<br> Don't worry about that plane.<br> It's one of ours, I think.<br> Halt. Password.<br> - Hamburgers.<br> - Onions.<br> I thought the 101st<br> was the only division here.<br> They will be<br> as soon as the rest of us can get out.<br> - What's up?<br> - We were a little over to the east.<br> Been there for weeks without firing a shot.<br> Then they started coming.<br> Tanks, planes. Everything<br> you ever heard of and then some.<br> A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker<br> in English.<br> It said Hitler will give Paris<br> to the Germans for a Christmas present.<br> But they told us<br> it was just a weak little counterattack.<br> They'll probably tell you<br> that this is a strategic withdrawal.<br> - Good morning, soldier.<br> - Bonjour.<br> I'll be back in a minute.<br> Keep an eye on... What's going on?<br> Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move<br> I Company up on the line.<br> - That is, if you agree.<br> - I should have known better.<br> Maybe she'll give you a refund<br> on those chocolate bars.<br> How much time have I got?<br> Ten minutes? Five minutes?<br> Anything you gotta do,<br> you better do in 30 seconds.<br> Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.<br> Drop your packs and rolls.<br> Third platoon, on your feet.<br> We've got that patch of woods to clear.<br> Third platoon,<br> any time there's a dirty detail.<br> Let's not be having<br> any talk like that, soldier.<br> Let's go.<br> Keep sight of the man on each side of you.<br> Watch out for snipers.<br> Snipers, the man says.<br> Second squad, over here. Dig in.<br> You're in charge till I get back.<br> I'm going to see the Lieutenant.<br> - Don't go volunteer for any patrols.<br> - Who do I dig with, Sergeant?<br> That's right, we've got an odd man.<br> You can triple up with me and Hansan.<br> - Thanks. You want me to go with you?<br> - No, you stay and get the hole started.<br> Come on, Hansan, let's go.<br> Take ten, Jarvess.<br> Time for me to spare you.<br> Get out of here.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Let's not try to reach China this time.<br> There's no sense digging<br> if you don't go deep.<br> Last time we dug one together...<br> you went so deep that when I climbed out<br> I got the bends.<br> - How does it look?<br> - Great.<br> Only one thing wrong. We're moving.<br> - What?<br> - You heard me. It ain't my idea.<br> Saddle up, everybody, let's go.<br> Oh, no!<br> Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole...<br> and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.<br> Will you stop yapping?<br> First and third squads<br> gotta run patrols all night.<br> - All we gotta do is...<br> - Standiferd, take over.<br> - I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.<br> - Okay.<br> You better take a blanket with you.<br> This fog...<br> really gets to you.<br> I feel kind of woozy myself.<br> Let's go, Hansan.<br> Just get it started. We'll finish it up.<br> When you were in that camp<br> in New York...<br> - did you ever phone your wife?<br> - Sure.<br> - What did it cost?<br> - A nickel. What did you think?<br> That's right. She came there to see you.<br> Did you phone your kids long distance?<br> Yeah, just before we shipped out.<br> - Why?<br> - What did that cost?<br> $2 for three minutes.<br> - Why, Johnny?<br> - I was thinking...<br> it's probably about as far from New York<br> to Wichita, where your kids were...<br> as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles,<br> where my folks are.<br> And when you get back home...<br> what would that be, about 200 francs?<br> I'll send you a bill, Johnny.<br> Tell them that I...<br> Well, you'll think of something.<br> And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.<br> Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.<br> Put on that steel pot<br> and get over to the roadblock.<br> Three on a shift at night:<br> You, Kipp, and the new man.<br> They said to look out<br> for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.<br> What about the password?<br> That might be nice to know,<br> in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.<br> - Bug-jitter.<br> - Thanks.<br> Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.<br> Okay, you get half of them.<br> - How do you feel, Standiferd?<br> - Terrible.<br> It's settling down in my chest.<br> I'm almost sure I have a fever.<br> I had a fever in Holland, but the medics<br> wouldn't let me off the line.<br> You have to have 102. That's a regulation.<br> Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.<br> Yeah, it sounds good.<br> Halt! Password!<br> - Bug.<br> - Jitter.<br> - What is this, Charlie Company?<br> - No, sir, ltem.<br> I Company?<br> This must be the road to Neufchteau.<br> - I think it is.<br> - You want to be sure of things, soldier.<br> - Is there a bridge up ahead?<br> - Yes, about half a mile out.<br> Good. Let's go.<br> Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.<br> Must be a new replacement.<br> Don't let that happen again.<br> Speak English.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Oh, no!<br> Look, Pop, it's snowing!<br> I never saw snow up close before.<br> It's beautiful.<br> You didn't, by any chance hear...<br> that it's kind of cold<br> and a little on the wet side, did you?<br> Man, it's really coming down.<br> Well, close the window, Johnny,<br> and fix that hole in the roof.<br> You should know better<br> than to take off your boots in a foxhole.<br> You might want to start running fast.<br> - I can't sleep with wet boots on.<br> - Then wear your galoshes until they dry.<br> I ain't got no galoshes.<br> - Where did you get those branches?<br> - Where do you generally get branches?<br> - I didn't know if the woods were cleared.<br> - Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.<br> - K Company?<br> - Yeah.<br> I got a buddy in K Company.<br> - Is this K Company?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where will I find Hooper?<br> - Hooper? Never heard of him.<br> Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.<br> He's not in my platoon.<br> That first hole is the company C.P.<br> - They'll know where he is.<br> - Thanks.<br> What platoon is Hooper in,<br> William J. Hooper?<br> Nobody by that name in K Company.<br> Yes, there is. He came in with<br> the new replacements just the other day.<br> That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.<br> What's up?<br> That kid they got at last night,<br> name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.<br> Now I can finish<br> making out my morning report. Thanks.<br> Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.<br> You don't hear them coming.<br> You don't know what hit you.<br> You didn't even know his name.<br> We didn't even find his dog tags.<br> Chatsburg News.<br> Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.<br> I'll take it.<br> - Sorry, Pop.<br> - It'll probably come up in the next batch.<br> You act as if I want a discharge.<br> Man, I like it here.<br> Stick around, Kinnie. We're going<br> to choose up sides for a snowball fight.<br> Hand these letters out<br> with the rations, Hansan.<br> They're all dinner, for once without coffee.<br> Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed<br> lemonade powder:<br> "Simply add water<br> and serve ice-cold. Delicious."<br> - About that patrol, Kinnie...<br> - I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.<br> I want to be sure you'll be around to take<br> over the platoon if I have to go back.<br> My feet froze up pretty bad last night.<br> I want three volunteers<br> to go out on a patrol.<br> You, you, and you.<br> You're in charge, Holley.<br> Why am I always volunteering for patrol?<br> - I'm just a cowboy.<br> - All right, this is the deal, Holley.<br> G-2 says the Krauts<br> dropped some paratroops last night.<br> And they might be hiding in that patch<br> of woods on the other side of that farm.<br> G-2. Wonderful how<br> they always know what's cooking.<br> Well, I can tell you something<br> they do know.<br> Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms<br> infiltrated right through this area.<br> They blew up a bridge<br> on the road to Neufchteau.<br> Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?<br> - How did you know?<br> - We get all the latest rumors.<br> Rumor, my eye.<br> They captured one of them.<br> Spoke English perfect. Knew our<br> password, plan of deployment, everything.<br> Kinnie, how about showing me<br> the way to the aid station?<br> I'm freezing.<br> - Feeling any better?<br> - Worse. Much worse.<br> Never felt so sick in my life.<br> Maybe I've even got pneumonia.<br> He's really bad.<br> Yeah, he's a cinch to go back<br> to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.<br> I don't know. That penicillin...<br> He's liable to be back in a day.<br> Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.<br> Then they got to send you back.<br> No, thanks. I don't smoke.<br> Guys get sick, guys get wounded,<br> and nothing ever happens to me.<br> Nothing except that time<br> you broke your faux choppers.<br> It was when you were back. Kipp found<br> out you can't keep a man on the line...<br> unless he's got<br> at least six teeth of his own.<br> I didn't know about that.<br> So he broke his GI teeth<br> with the butt of his rifle.<br> I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.<br> He was off the line for two weeks<br> getting a new set made.<br> Let's get this patrol on the road.<br> That's incoming mail.<br> Holley, I think your eggs are about done.<br> We've had good deals before,<br> but this is the best one yet.<br> This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.<br> I found a home in the Army.<br> Of course, you can see snow from LA.<br> Way off in the mountains.<br> They got us zeroed in.<br> I'm getting out of here.<br> I hope he makes it. They should<br> never have sent him back on the line.<br> Some guys just can't take it.<br> Wolowicz, there's something<br> I want you to know.<br> My name is Layton.<br> - I know it is.<br> - I just wanted to be sure.<br> Thanks.<br> This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.<br> A whole division<br> could be hiding in that forest.<br> Nice job for a three-man patrol.<br> Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how<br> they'll know we ran into some Krauts.<br> - What's the password?<br> - Texas.<br> Keep them covered. They may be German.<br> - Any line on these woods, Major?<br> - I didn't hear the countersign.<br> Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.<br> Will this road take us<br> to Third Bat headquarters?<br> - Straight ahead.<br> - Get going.<br> - Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?<br> - How's that?<br> - I said what's a Texas leaguer?<br> - It's some kind of baseball term.<br> - What kind?<br> - A safe hit just over the infielder's head...<br> Nobody asked you.<br> How'd the Dodgers make out?<br> - Who's your commanding officer?<br> - He knows how the Dodgers made out.<br> - Let's see your dog tags.<br> - What?<br> We're not taking any chances.<br> What is this?<br> What kind of nonsense...<br> Drop those rifles.<br> - Who's Betty Grable going with?<br> - Cesar Romero.<br> - Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?<br> - She's in Terry and the Pirates.<br> - What's a hotrod?<br> - A hopped-up jalopy.<br> - Joe, what do you know?<br> - Just got back from a vaudeville show.<br> - I guess they're okay.<br> - Thank you, Sergeant.<br> PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.<br> That's why I believe in being careful.<br> May I suggest, sir,<br> that you study up on baseball?<br> I guess I'd better.<br> By the way, you might tell your buddy<br> that Cesar Romero is out.<br> She's married to Harry James.<br> Let's go.<br> They really should have sent out<br> a bigger patrol.<br> - Lf you want to goof off...<br> - Who said anything about goofing off?<br> Nobody.<br> I'm just saying<br> the best way is to tell them...<br> you heard voices talking in German.<br> Let's say we heard voices talking<br> in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.<br> That paper any good?<br> Best in the world. Sedalia News.<br> Keep your gloves off for two minutes and<br> you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.<br> Get a load of this.<br> "Our Changing Times,<br> by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...<br> "pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist<br> and her favorite husband...<br> "now on active duty, US Army."<br> You knew I worked on a newspaper.<br> Yeah, but a column?<br> You must be pretty good.<br> I was too good. I wrote a piece<br> about the real meaning of the war...<br> the fight against Fascism, why every<br> American had to get in there and pitch in.<br> The logic was magnificent.<br> You couldn't resist it.<br> The next thing I knew,<br> I was in a troop train...<br> waving bye-bye to my wife.<br> - Came the dawn?<br> - Yeah.<br> Only one thing gets me.<br> When you work on a newspaper...<br> I'd get those wire releases...<br> and know that I was the first person<br> in town who had the news. All the news.<br> I'll guarantee you, my wife knows<br> what's going on in Bastogne.<br> All I know is<br> what's happening to the second squad...<br> in the third platoon of I Company.<br> Watch this one.<br> Strike!<br> Can't hit them if you can't see them.<br> Now the count's three and two.<br> Man on first and third.<br> Two out. This is the one that counts.<br> Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.<br> Burn it in, boy. Come on.<br> A hit right over second base.<br> There, the center fielder<br> made a shoestring catch. You're out.<br> - How about it, ump?<br> - Sound off, pal. Password?<br> Don't you get it? Right over second base.<br> - Texas.<br> - Leaguer.<br> - You in charge?<br> - No, the lieutenant.<br> Hiya, fellows.<br> What's the situation, Lieutenant?<br> Nothing but pine trees in these woods.<br> We've been through them.<br> - I guess our mission's accomplished.<br> - Courtesy of K Company.<br> You can tell them to stop worrying<br> about this area.<br> Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.<br> - I guess we might as well partie.<br> - So long.<br> - So long.<br> - So long, fellows.<br> Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.<br> Come on!<br> Kraut tanks!<br> No. Take off, will you?<br> If they think we're all getting away,<br> maybe I've got a chance.<br> - Go on.<br> - We'll send a patrol back.<br> - Don't forget the sulfa powder.<br> - Go on, get in there.<br> Let's go.<br> - You're sure they were enemy tanks?<br> - We saw them, Lieutenant.<br> Think we've got enough<br> antitank grenades to do any good?<br> We ain't got any.<br> Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?<br> What?<br> Sir, our usual defense against tanks<br> is to call for artillery...<br> and then run like a jackrabbit.<br> We've got orders to hold these positions.<br> All right, sir, but let's call for artillery<br> and keep our heads down.<br> We could send out some bazooka men,<br> if we had any bazookas.<br> - Put in a call for artillery.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What a break.<br> Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.<br> Concentration 17.<br> Item three to ltem:<br> Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.<br> Concentration 17.<br> Roger. Start the fireworks.<br> That's great. Artillery can't miss.<br> They've got Roderigues to use<br> for an aiming stick.<br> Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues<br> as soon as this barrage lifts.<br> With what, a sponge?<br> I've got to get me a rifle.<br> Any extra ones, Garby?<br> No, we haven't had any casualties yet.<br> There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.<br> Your squad sent for the meat wagon<br> after the last shelling.<br> - Who was hit, Doc?<br> - Wolowicz.<br> Is he bad?<br> A shell landed<br> right on the edge of his foxhole.<br> His shoulder's like a sieve.<br> - Where's your steel pot, soldier?<br> - I lost it, Sergeant.<br> You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.<br> You're in charge now.<br> Leadership. That's what I got.<br> Where's Roderigues?<br> He'll be along, Pop.<br> Should have worn my shoulder pads.<br> In a couple of months you'll be flipping<br> those forward passes as good as ever.<br> Yeah, left-handed.<br> He's a good man, Holley...<br> but still a little jumpy.<br> He can move in with me.<br> You could do worse.<br> He sleeps warm and quiet.<br> His name's Layton. Jim Layton.<br> - So long, Wolowicz.<br> - Take it easy.<br> Say hello to Standiferd.<br> - Hansan, you can move in with Pop.<br> - What about Roderigues?<br> Is that incoming mail?<br> No, it's outgoing.<br> There'll be plenty more of it.<br> - What time is it, Hansan?<br> - 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.<br> Where's Roderigues?<br> Let's take a walk, Pop.<br> How much longer<br> are they going to leave him out there?<br> Let's partie.<br> We can carry him back in this blanket.<br> I want three volunteers.<br> It's a long walk, Pop.<br> - I need a fourth for bridge.<br> - I'll be the dummy.<br> You don't have to, Layton.<br> Maybe you'll find some more eggs.<br> What are you looking for, Kipp,<br> your discharge?<br> - I lost my teeth.<br> - You lost them?<br> They were searching me on<br> a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.<br> - And they jumped out?<br> - Dropped out.<br> I hope it's nice and warm<br> back where you're going.<br> I can't chew on K rations with my gums.<br> No! Keep your eye open.<br> He used to see snow<br> way off in the mountains.<br> They say it's just like going to sleep.<br> He was a religious kid.<br> When anyone got hit...<br> he used to say it was God's will.<br> - What's the Bulge?<br> - Search me.<br> "Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on<br> yesterday under a news eclipse...<br> "from which filtered the fact that German<br> armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."<br> We're in Belgium, aren't we?<br> Thought it was Luxembourg.<br> Let's see that.<br> "War Department authorities report<br> that morale is high all along the front.<br> "Battle-hardened doughboys<br> fresh from epic-making triumphs..."<br> Skip the commercial, Jarvess.<br> "Air activity was halted by<br> thick, swirling fog.<br> "At Bastogne, the 101st Airborne..."<br> Hey, that's us.<br> Then you'll be proud to know<br> that you are making a heroic stand...<br> "hurling back the best<br> that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."<br> - Who's Von Rundstedt?<br> - A Kraut general.

Right on the ball.<br> Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.<br> Let's be chicken those bolts.<br> Check your rifles.<br> Why can't they pass down<br> some information?<br> If a man gets hit, he must at least know<br> what country he's dying in.<br> Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.<br> I've asked you 800 times...<br> I won't say that no more, Jarvess.<br> That's for sure.<br> Can't see them.<br> I'm with you, Holley.<br> Come on.<br> Second squad!

I was scared to death.<br> You just joined the biggest club<br> in the Army. Everybody belongs.<br> Just drop me off at the psycho ward.<br> Why did I have to get up and start firing?<br> A good thing somebody did.<br> Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.<br> It happened so fast,<br> you had no time to look at your watch.<br> Yeah, sure forgot what time it was<br> in Springfield.<br> - Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...<br> - You can have it.<br> Let's get out of here, chum.<br> Thanks, Pop.<br> I'll drop back later.<br> Just don't get carried back.<br> Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?<br> Morphine. Him.<br> No more morphine?<br> That's great.<br> She pours him one more,<br> I'm gonna get myself shot.<br> They're way too big.<br> I wished we'd found them yesterday.<br> Let's go, men. Chow!<br> - What?<br> - You heard me. Hot chow!<br> I've been pulling KP ever since.<br> We was bombed out twice.<br> I'm telling you,<br> I never saw so much incoming mail.<br> Yeah, things are getting rough all over.<br> I wanted to go back on the line.<br> But they're short-handed<br> in the kitchen, see.<br> A couple more KPs got hit this morning.<br> I wouldn't mind a little action<br> for a change.<br> How about you and me switching?<br> Oh, no. They'd never let me go.<br> I've been learning how to cook.<br> - Bettis, anything left?<br> - No.<br> But it's clean. It's only leftovers.<br> I don't even see those things.<br> I wanna see them.<br> I wanna remember them.<br> We'll start back in about an hour.<br> Better stick around this area.<br> Where's the kid?<br> Who, Layton?

Hitler kaput.<br> How would you like some nice K rations?<br> Now we're getting somewhere.<br> He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.<br> What did he say?<br> They want us to surrender.<br> "Surrender or be killed," he says.<br> Us?<br> Tell him to go take a flying leap<br> at a rolling doughnut.<br> The Major thinks General McAuliffe<br> must have misunderstood.<br> We've appealed<br> to the well-known American humanity...<br> to save the people of Bastogne<br> from further suffering.<br> We have given you two hours to consider<br> before raining destruction upon you.<br> We do not understand<br> General McAuliffe's answer.<br> I'll be glad to repeat it.<br> The answer is, "Nuts!"<br> Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?<br> "Nuts" is strictly negative.<br> We will kill many Americans.<br> On your way, bud.<br> I feel better. For once we know<br> what's going on around here.<br> For once we get the story...<br> before my wife writes it up<br> and it's the daily news.<br> Here goes my last butt.<br> Don't tell me your problems.<br> Tell the chaplain.<br> Chaplain. I forgot.<br> We've got nothing to worry about.<br> Holy Joe is going to pray for us<br> at the Christmas services.<br> "They that wait upon the Lord<br> shall renew their strength.<br> "They shall mount up<br> with wings as eagles."<br> If the fog lifts.<br> "They shall run, and not be weary."<br> Unless they have frozen feet.<br> "And they shall walk, and not faint."<br> If they don't lose too much blood<br> before the medics come up.<br> Another airmail message from the Krauts.<br> "Merry Christmas, soldier,<br> and our deepest sympathy.<br> "It's tough being away from home<br> at this time of year...<br> "especially when you're surrounded<br> and outnumbered 10-to-1.<br> "Don't you feel your loved ones<br> worrying about you, praying for you?<br> "Yes, old boy, praying and hoping<br> you'll come home again.<br> "Man, have you thought about it?<br> What if you don't come back?<br> "Just remember this:<br> Where there's a will, there's a way.<br> "Hot chow and safety are waiting for you<br> only 300 yards away."<br> Anybody here from Ohio?<br> - Buckeye Lake, sir.<br> - Cincinnati.<br> - Maple Heights, sir.<br> - Tippecanoe City, sir.<br> I'm from Chillicothe.<br> Any of you men Lutherans?<br> Here, sir.<br> - I am, sir.<br> - My wife is, sir.<br> So am I.<br> These services aren't just for Lutherans,<br> any more than just for men from Ohio.<br> I merely happen to be in your area.<br> In other areas, there are other chaplains<br> of various denominations and religions.<br> All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.<br> Earlier this month in Holland,<br> I held Hanukkah services...<br> for some of the men of the Jewish faith.<br> How did I do, Levenstein?<br> Not bad for a beginner, sir.<br> Now it's nearly Christmas...<br> and here we are in beautiful Bastogne<br> enjoying the winter sports.<br> And the $64 question is:<br> "Was this trip necessary?"<br> I'll try to answer that.<br> But my sermons,<br> like everything else in the army...<br> depend on the situation and the terrain.<br> So I assure you<br> this is going to be a quickie.<br> Was this trip necessary?<br> Let's look at the facts.<br> Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.<br> A great many people tried to deal<br> with them, and a lot of them are dead.<br> Millions have died...<br> for no other reason<br> except that the Nazis wanted them dead.<br> So, in the final showdown,<br> there was nothing left to do except fight.<br> There's a great lesson in this.<br> Those of us who've learned it<br> the hard way aren't going to forget it.<br> We must never again<br> let any force dedicated to a super-race...<br> or a super-idea, or super-anything...<br> become strong enough<br> to impose itself upon a free world.<br> We must be smart enough<br> and tough enough in the beginning...<br> to put out the fire<br> before it starts spreading.<br> So my answer to the $64 question is:<br> Yes, this trip was necessary.<br> As the years go by,<br> a lot of people are going to forget.<br> But you won't.<br> And don't ever let anybody tell you...<br> you were a sucker<br> to fight in the war against Fascism.<br> And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.<br> Let us pray for this fog to lift.<br> Almighty God...<br> The organist is hitting those bass notes<br> a little too loud for me to be heard.<br> So let us each pray in his own way,<br> to his own God.<br> When you hear planes, men,<br> don't bother to look up.<br> They'll be ours.<br> Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.<br> Layton, you haven't got<br> a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?<br> I'm on that new lemonade diet.<br> Drop another nickel in the jukebox,<br> will you, chum?<br> We interrupt this program<br> with an important announcement.<br> A careful study of the most<br> scientific instruments and maps...<br> lead to the following weather forecast.<br> Continued cold, more snow,<br> and no sign of the fog lifting.<br> And now an old favorite,<br> which is growing more and more popular...<br> with the men of the 101st:<br> I Surrender, Dear.<br> Krauts walking around down there.<br> Tanks, too.<br> What am I supposed to use<br> for ammunition? Spitballs?<br> We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.<br> - What about the tank at the roadblock?<br> - Can't move up. They're out of gas.<br> Try and get some news on that radio.<br> Krauts have got it jammed up,<br> everything except their own wavelength.<br> I'll try again.<br> They ain't even dug in.<br> - Holley.<br> - What?<br> Is there anything to those stories<br> about Krauts shooting prisoners?<br> - Where'd you get that?<br> - It's going around.<br> I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol<br> on you when you're captured...<br> they blow your brains out with it.<br> Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.<br> Anybody want a Luger?<br> It's worth $100 in Paris.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> It's a violation of the Sullivan Act<br> for a civilian to carry firearms.<br> If I was you, Lieutenant,<br> I'd hightail it out of here.<br> Other side of the hill! Dig in!<br> A careful study of the most<br> scientific instruments and maps...<br> leads me to believe<br> that German bombers are over Bastogne...<br> fog or no fog.<br> Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.<br> Yeah, I've been thinking...<br> the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant...<br> the pill roller who gives us those shots<br> with a square needle...<br> I'm bleeding for them.<br> ... let me avoid death...<br> let me have forgiveness...<br> the eternal farewell.<br> Fall out in and draw a rifle!<br> - A rifle?<br> - They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.<br> The medics told me I wasn't supposed<br> to go up anymore. You can check.<br> Get your blanket.<br> Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!<br> - Chow?<br> - You ain't even warm.<br> Follow me, all of you, on the double!<br> That's all, brother.<br> Hey, you! Front and center!<br> Good thing they didn't send me up.<br> I never even fired an M-1 rifle.<br> Last time I was out on the range,<br> they were still using the.03.<br> All litter cases will prepare<br> to be evacuated immediately...<br> to air raid shelters.<br> All walking wounded<br> will fall out and draw rifles.<br> This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated,<br> clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.<br> Look, you ain't selling it to me.<br> You're only showing me how it works.<br> To load it, you just pull the bolt back<br> like this, and stick the clip in.<br> - What's up, Smitty?<br> - Battalion says to pull back.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - You, too, sir. They said to tell you.<br> It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.<br> I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.<br> Lieutenant, take the second squad.<br> First squad! Third squad! Over here.<br> Save it, Layton.<br> They'll be getting a lot closer,<br> and we'll still be here.<br> It's shining!<br> How have you been?<br> Jarvess, look at them! They got here!<br> Drive them out of there! Blast them!<br> C-47s!<br> What was that about eagles?<br> "They shall mount up<br> with wings as eagles.<br> "They shall run and not be weary."<br> - Well, what are we waiting for?<br> - Let's go!<br> - Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.<br> - Lighter?<br> I got a little old lamp I got to fill<br> back in Bastogne.<br> K rations.<br> All dinners.<br> Hey, fellows, here it is.<br> Hey, fellows, come and get it.<br> Here, take your watch.<br> Daddy, what are them things?<br> It's a new kind of warfare, son.<br> Mechanized, I think they call it.<br> Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.<br> What will they think of next?<br> Tank job, cigarette for papa?<br> Got a Stars and Stripes?<br> It's two days old.<br> Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.<br> That's for sure. That's for dang sure.<br> Hey, handsome.<br> Good luck!<br> The folks back home<br> knew we'd get out of this.<br> They heard relief was breaking through<br> two days ago.<br> Fine. I'd hate to think<br> they'd been worrying.<br> You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium,<br> not Luxembourg.<br> Just so we're going back.<br> That's all that counts.<br> You mean you're not happy in the service?<br> I didn't say that. I love it.<br> You found a home in the Army, chum.<br> Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.<br> Third platoon, on your feet.<br> Fall in.<br> Oh, no!<br> About face.<br> Forward march.<br> Whatever happened to Jody?<br> All right. Come on.<br> What do you want these guys to think,<br> you're a bunch of WACs?<br> All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.<br> English<br>
