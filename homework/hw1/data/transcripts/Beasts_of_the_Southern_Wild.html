You alone?<br> That's it?<br> Get in here.<br> Let me show you a magic trick.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> When you're a child,<br> people say that life...<br> ...is gonna be happy<br> and hunky-dory and all that bullshit...<br> ...but I'm here to tell you that it's not, so<br> you need to get that out your head right now.<br> Because, yeah, life is some big old feast,<br> but you...<br> ...ain't nothing<br> but a stupid little waitress.<br> One day, everything on your plate<br> gonna fall on the floor.<br> And nobody gonna be there<br> to pick it up for you.<br> One day, it's gonna be all on you.<br> You understand what I'm saying?<br> So smile, girl.<br> Smile.<br> Because nobody like<br> a pity-party-having-ass woman.<br> The gator is magic.<br> Oh. Mm-hm.<br> You can take care of me.<br> Me and Daddy.<br> Don't know nothing about your daddy.<br> I can't take care of nobody but myself.<br> And if that isn't love<br> It'll have to do<br> You can stay if you want.<br> Until the real thing comes along<br> I'd gladly move<br> This is my favorite thing.<br> To prove my love, dear, and its worth<br> I know.<br> If that isn't love,<br> It'll have to do<br> I can count all the times I've been lifted.<br> I can count all the times I've been lifted<br> on two fingers.<br> Wink! Bring my baby here!<br> We got to wash her up!<br> No, that waits.<br> All right, fatso, breathe some air.<br> I need to go home.<br> If that isn't love<br> It'll have to do<br> Until the real thing comes along<br> You're my friend, kind of.<br> I gotta take care of mine.<br> Real good.<br> No crying, hear?<br> No crying.<br> Don't you cry.<br> As I stand by the bayou,<br> I watch a ship as she disappears.<br> There, she is gone.<br> And we cry for this.<br> But she's not gone.<br> She's just as real as when she left me.<br> And somewhere else,<br> other voices are calling out:<br> "Here she comes."<br> And that is dying.<br> Here she comes!<br> When it all goes quiet<br> behind my eyes...<br> ...I see everything that made me...<br> ...flying around in invisible pieces.<br> When I look too hard, it goes away.<br> But when it all goes quiet,<br> I see they are right here.<br> I see that I'm a little piece<br> of a big, big universe.<br> And that makes things right.<br> When I die, the scientists of the future...<br> ...they're going to find it all.<br> They're going to know...<br> ...once, there was a Hushpuppy...<br> ...and she lived with her daddy<br> in the Bathtub.<br>
