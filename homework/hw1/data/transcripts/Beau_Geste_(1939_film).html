Dead.<br> It may be a trap, Major.<br> Let me go.<br> You are too important.<br> May I go, sir?<br> Yes.<br> Go over the wall<br> and open the gates.<br> Keep your eyes open!<br> What about<br> those 2 shots, sir?<br> I can ask the questions<br> myself, Dufour.<br> It shouldn't have<br> taken him this long.<br> No, sir.<br> I'm going over myself.<br> I'll tear the place down if<br> you're not out in 5 minutes.<br> All right.<br> Bugler!<br> Bugler!<br> Bugler!<br> Answer me!<br> Bugler!<br> Bugler!<br> Halt!<br> I'm glad<br> to see you, sir.<br> Thanks.<br> Come here.<br> Not a soul alive<br> in the place.<br> No sign of an enemy?<br> No, sir.<br> They're dead.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Where's the bugler?<br> Look for him if you want to.<br> I have.<br> No thanks, sir.<br> Up here is a young man<br> who died peacefully.<br> Beside him is a sergeant<br> with a French bayonet<br> through his heart.<br> Where, sir?<br> Never mind.<br> I have several questions<br> I'd like to ask, sir.<br> I have a few myself.<br> We'll camp<br> in the oasis tonight.<br> Tomorrow, I'll get<br> to the bottom of this<br> if I have to take a trip<br> to the next world.<br> Touaregs!<br> Fall back<br> on the oasis.<br> Break ranks<br> and fall back to the oasis!<br> Dufour, I want 2 men to go back<br> to Fort Tokotu for reinforcements.<br> Right, sir.<br> We'll go, sir.<br> Good.<br> Now, one of you<br> must get through.<br> Split up when you get<br> in the desert.<br> Have Lt.

No.<br> Are you all right?<br> Well...<br> Now be careful.<br> It hit pretty hard.<br> Don't bump that leg.<br> Here we are.<br> Lie down...<br> Steady.<br> ...and we'll examine<br> the wound.<br> Do you... Do you want<br> to bite on a bullet?<br> That's what they<br> always do in books.<br> Will... will I get<br> promoted if I do?<br> If you don't shout.<br> l... I won't shout.<br> I'm ready,<br> Captain.<br> Sit on him.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Wait till Aunt Patricia<br> hears about this.<br> There it is.<br> Bandage him, Isobel.<br> Look, Digby.<br> Oh, that must<br> have hurt going in.<br> Not half as much<br> as it did coming out!<br> You're very brave.<br> Oh, no, I'm not.<br> I just wanted<br> to be promoted.<br> I'm proud of you, John.<br> You'll be knighted<br> and given a Viking's funeral.<br> No! Really, Beau?<br> l... I mean, Admiral?<br> Kneel.<br> Ooh.<br> I dub you<br> Sir John Geste, Knight.<br> Rise, Sir Knight.<br> Get a ship ready, Captain.<br> Right, sir.<br> Sir John Geste.<br> Wait a minute.<br> A Viking always has to be<br> buried with a dog at his feet.<br> There's one on the table<br> in the study.<br> I'll go and get it.<br> Isobel, I think<br> this is awfully silly.<br> I never speak<br> to common sailors.<br> John, l...<br> Sir John!<br> Sir John, I think you're as<br> silly as the rest of them.<br> Here it is.<br> Ah. Very good, Captain.<br> Put it at Sir John's feet,<br> light the fire and cast off.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Hats off!<br> Attention!<br> Bugler,<br> blow the last post.<br> Are you crying<br> because you're proud<br> or because you're wounded?<br> Because I'm proud!<br> There, that's what I want<br> when my turn comes.<br> I'd give anything to have a Viking's<br> funeral, with a dog at my feet<br> and the last post<br> blown for me.<br> If it weren't<br> too much trouble.<br> Beau, it isn't<br> too much trouble.<br> I'll give you one<br> whenever you like.<br> Here comes Aunt Patricia.<br> Wait till<br> she hears about John's leg.<br> Sir John.<br> And you keep your mouth shut.<br> Children. I want to introduce<br> you to an old friend of mine.<br> Captain Henri de Beaujolais.<br> Henri,<br> this is Michael Geste.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> And Digby.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> And John,<br> the youngest brother.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> And this is<br> Isobel Rivers, my ward.<br> And Augustus Brandon,<br> Sir Hector's nephew.<br> How do you do, sir?<br> Aunt Patricia, John got<br> a bullet in his leg<br> and Beau took it out<br> with a penknife!<br> Oh, John!<br> It's... it's nothing,<br> Aunt Patricia.<br> It... it didn't even hurt.<br> Let me see, John.<br> An excellent job<br> of surgery!<br> We couldn't do better than<br> that in the Foreign Legion.<br> Which is Beau?<br> Oh, I am, sir.<br> You have<br> a very steady hand.<br> Well, I'm very glad<br> to have met you all.<br> Goodbye.<br> As soon as I get<br> old enough,<br> I'm going to join<br> the Foreign Legion.<br> That's exactly<br> what I was thinking.<br> Me, too.<br> But of course, we'd have<br> to leave Aunt Patricia.<br> Oh.<br> That's right.<br> Oh, I suppose<br> we'll have to give it up.<br> She'll always need some<br> men around to protect her.<br> I like your family,<br> Patricia.<br> Especially the Gestes?<br> Yes. Why do you ask?<br> Everybody does.<br> Who are they?<br> Orphans.<br> Three young gentlemen<br> of fortune that I've adopted.<br> And Augustus is Sir<br> Hector's heir, I suppose?<br> Mmm-hmm. If Sir Hector leaves<br> him anything to inherit.<br> Has he really managed<br> to go through everything?<br> Only the sapphire is left.<br> I'm sorry, Patricia.<br> Oh, I don't mind for myself.<br> It's the children.<br> I want to raise them and<br> give them a chance in life.<br> I'm a little desperate<br> about that.<br> And I suppose Sir Hector<br> will be a little desperate<br> the next time<br> he comes home?<br> Mmm. He has to be<br> desperate to come home.<br> Incidentally,<br> before I go,<br> may I see this fabulous<br> sapphire of Sir Hector's?<br> I've been hearing about it<br> clear across the world.<br> Of course.<br> You know, I read this<br> in a book somewhere.<br> Do you mean to tell me in the Foreign<br> Legion they read adventure stories?<br> This gets<br> better and better.<br> This is called<br> the Priests' Refuge.<br> In Oliver Cromwell's time,<br> the Brandons used<br> to hide them here.<br> Hmm!<br> Takes your breath away.<br> That's the great-great-<br> grandfather of all sapphires.<br> It's the one thing<br> Sir Hector really loves.<br> Everything else he has but the<br> estate has been gambled away.<br> Hasn't it a history?<br> Isn't it supposed to bring<br> bad luck to its owners?<br> Bad luck? Do you think you could<br> ever make any Brandon believe<br> there was bad luck<br> in having 30,000 pounds?<br> Well, we're not<br> going to get out today.<br> Let's play something<br> in the house.<br> What could we play,<br> Beau?<br> We could play King Arthur and<br> his Knights of the Round Table.<br> How do you play that?<br> Well, I'm<br> King Arthur.<br> First, you put me<br> in this suit of armor...<br> Aunt Pat<br> wouldn't like that.<br> I'll take the blame<br> if she finds out.<br> Digby,<br> you're Sir Lancelot.<br> John, you're Sir Gawaine.<br> Isobel is Queen Guinevere.<br> And, Gussie,<br> you can be Sir Mordred.<br> Who's Sir Mordred?<br> He's the knight<br> who betrayed King Arthur.<br> Oh, I like that.<br> Digby, John, and Gussie will<br> have to get swords and helmets.<br> Now, help me into this<br> suit of armor before you go.<br> Can you manage?<br> l... I think so.<br> Oh! Oh.<br> We'll be back<br> in a minute, Sire.<br> Can you breathe<br> all right?<br> Fairly well.<br> Go, my people!<br> That will be all,<br> Burdon.<br> Ram Singh.<br> Aunt Pat!<br> Well, there goes<br> our king.<br> Thank you,<br> Ram Singh.<br> Beau, Beau,<br> are you all right?<br> Yes. Help me out.<br> What was that man with the<br> towel on his head doing here?<br> I don't know.<br> You were close enough<br> to hear what he was saying.<br> Oh, I suppose<br> I'll have to tell you.<br> He was from the Arabs.<br> He wanted me to fight on their<br> side against the Foreign Legion.<br> And... and he asked<br> Aunt Pat if I could go.<br> What did Aunt Pat say?<br> Well... well, no.<br> It sounds like a big lie<br> to me, John.<br> Just a moment, Digby.<br> Are you doubting<br> the word of King Arthur?<br> Why, no, Sire.<br> Are you, John?<br> I didn't say<br> a word, Sire.<br> Excuse me.<br> I hope I'm not intruding.<br> Oh, no, Aunt Pat.<br> We were just...<br> Please go on, Isobel.<br> May I?<br> Aren't you a little old for<br> those childish games, Beau?<br> Aren't you a little young for<br> those grown-up cigars, Gussie?<br> Is he still there?<br> Yes. Don't make<br> so much noise.<br> What's the difference? He<br> knows we're after him now.<br> All right.<br> Then let's get to work.<br> Let's not act hastily.<br> This requires<br> some preparation.<br> All we need to do<br> is move the couch.<br> He'll move fast.<br> We gotta watch out for him.<br> Well, one of us<br> on each side.<br> And have him walk out<br> right between us?<br> I can see you haven't done much<br> of this sort of thing, Digby.<br> Now, you move the couch<br> and I'll cover the ground.<br> The minute he shows his head,<br> I'll be on him like a tiger.<br> Now look, I flushed him,<br> I stood watch while<br> you armed yourself.<br> It's up to you<br> to move the couch.<br> Sorry, old boy,<br> I don't see it your way.<br> Well, then we'll need a<br> third party to move the couch<br> while we do the dirty work.<br> John.<br> No, he's too busy.<br> We can't disturb him.<br> What's more important<br> than this?<br> When you get a little older<br> you'll realize. Love.<br> Love?<br> You mean he's in love<br> with Isobel?<br> Horribly. Worst case<br> I've ever seen.<br> Well, he has<br> my blessing.<br> Here he comes!<br> Cute little fellow,<br> isn't he?<br> Probably been here<br> for years.<br> Has a family, too,<br> I suppose.<br> Well, go ahead, Beau.<br> After all, it's your room.<br> It must be your mouse.<br> Digby, we can't go down<br> and face all the others<br> with blood all over<br> our hands, can we?<br> No.<br> Remind me tonight to bring<br> him up some cheese, will you?<br> Did you have fun?<br> Think of him<br> behind that couch.<br> Same form of rodent.<br> Thank you.<br> The Gestes are<br> such witty fellows<br> to themselves.<br> Ghastly!<br> If I could only...<br> Shush!<br> Don't argue with<br> the heir, Digby.<br> Thank you.<br> A telegram.<br> First one in 5 years.<br> Who's it for,<br> Burdon?<br> Her Ladyship, sir.<br> I wonder if anything's<br> happened to Sir Hector.<br> Now, please don't start<br> reciting the will, Gussie,<br> until we find out<br> definitely.<br> Telegram, Madam.<br> Oh, thank you,<br> Burdon.<br> Sir Hector is well,<br> I trust?<br> Quite well, Augustus.<br> And we are going to have<br> a visit from him.<br> Oh.<br> That's splendid.<br> I don't understand.<br> He never comes home<br> this time of year.<br> Only because he's<br> never needed money<br> at this time of the year<br> before, Augustus.<br> Well, I don't see what more he<br> expects to get out of the estate.<br> You forget the Blue Water.<br> Why, he wouldn't sell the<br> Blue Water, would he, Aunt Pat?<br> I'm afraid that's<br> what he intends doing.<br> Why, there wouldn't be<br> anything left!<br> Excuse me.<br> Aunt Pat,<br> would you show us<br> the Blue Water before you go?<br> We may not get<br> another chance to see it.<br> Very well. Burdon.<br> Yes, Madam?<br> Will you come to the Priests'<br> Refuge with me, please?<br> And bring a candle.<br> Yes, Madam.<br> Well, why are we<br> all so glum?<br> Selling the Blue Water isn't<br> the end of everything, is it?<br> It is for Gussie.<br> Poor Aunt Pat.<br> She probably doesn't mind<br> losing the Blue Water.<br> It's having Sir Hector<br> around again.<br> Well, that's a splendid way<br> to talk about your benefactor.<br> Where would you be<br> if it weren't for him?<br> I don't know, Ghastly,<br> but not with you, at any rate.<br> We couldn't quietly arrange<br> to dispose of Sir Hector<br> in some way before<br> he gets home, could we?<br> Oh, nothing gory,<br> of course.<br> Thank you,<br> Burdon.<br> It looks like a piece of sky<br> that had become solid,<br> with sunlight<br> imprisoned in it.<br> Cold sunlight.<br> Cold as the unhappiness<br> it has brought so many people.<br> Well, must have blown a fuse.<br> Isobel, you're the closest.<br> Try the switch.<br> So somebody<br> turned them off.<br> Another Geste joke?<br> It's... It's gone!<br> Why... why,<br> it's impossible!<br> Somebody in this room<br> took it.<br> Now, don't be any more of an<br> ass than you can help, Ghastly.<br> There's no one in this<br> room but the family.
