                        (men singing in Latin)<br> (bell ringing)<br> (chanting in Latin)<br> Well, Thomas Becket,<br> are you satisfied?<br> Here I am stripped,<br> kneeling at your tomb<br> while those treacherous Saxon monks<br> of yours are getting ready to thrash me.<br> Me, with my delicate skin.<br> I bet you'd never have done<br> the same for me.<br> But I suppose I have to do this penance<br> and make my peace with you.<br> Hmm.<br> What a strange end to our story.<br> How cold it was when we last met<br> on the shores of France.<br> Funny, it's nearly always been cold,<br> except at the beginning<br> when we were friends.<br> We did have a few<br> fine summer evenings with the girls.<br> Did you love Gwendolen, Archbishop?<br> Did you hate me<br> the night I took her from you,<br> shouting, "I am the king"?<br> Perhaps that's what<br> you could never forgive me for.<br> Look at them lurking there,<br> gloating.<br> Oh, Thomas,<br> I'm ashamed of this<br> whole silly masquerade.<br> All right, so I've come here to<br> make my peace with their Saxon hero,<br> because I need them now,<br> those Saxon peasants of yours.<br> Now I'll call them my sons,<br> as you wanted me to.<br> You taught me that, too.<br> You taught me everything.<br> Those were the happy times.<br> Do you remember?<br> At the peep of dawn,<br> and as usual we'd been drinking<br> and wenching in the town.<br> You were even better at that<br> than I was.<br> (man and woman laughing)<br> (snoring)<br> (laughter continues)<br> (creak)<br> - (gasps)<br> - Shh. Listen.<br> - Huh?<br> - Upstairs.<br> (laughter continues)<br> - She's up with someone.<br> - Well, go on up.<br> (laughter continues)<br> - Shh.<br> - (laughter continues)<br> (gasps)<br> (screaming)<br> - Get up, man, get on up there!<br> - Quick, out through the window.<br> Thank you.<br> (woman gasps)<br> Oh. Ah. Ooh.<br> Come on now.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come here.<br> I'll lay my hands on her, the dirty slut.<br> Where is he, the swine?<br> You don't - Don't you dare,<br> don't you dare - (sobbing)<br> - Here. Catch.<br> - Ha! Ho! Hyah! Ah!<br> - (laughing)<br> - Go on, get in there.<br> - (both grunting)<br> - Here. Take my boot.<br> I can't get my boot back on.<br> - Faster now.<br> - (laughing)<br> Whoo!<br> Whoo! Whoo!<br> (shivering)<br> Oh, Rub harder, pig. I'm cold.<br> Ah, no one does it the way you do,<br> Thomas.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I think you actually like the cold.<br> I made you a nobleman.<br> Why do you play at being my valet?<br> I'm your servant in the council chamber,<br> or here in the bath.<br> My Norman barons resent it. They feel it's<br> your Saxon way of mocking their nobility.<br> Nobility lies in the man, my prince,<br> not in the towel.<br> Have you any idea how much trouble<br> I took to make you noble?<br> I think so. I recall you pointed a finger<br> and said, "Thomas Becket, you are noble."<br> The queen and your mother<br> became very agitated.<br> (chuckles)<br> They're always agitated.<br> No, I mean trouble from the barons.<br> They hate you, you know?<br> Of course. One always hates<br> what one wrongs.<br> When you Normans invaded England,<br> you seized our Saxon land,<br> burned our Saxon homes,<br> raped our Saxon sisters.<br> Naturally, you hate Saxons.<br> Don't include me.<br> It was my great grandfather William<br> who was called "The Conqueror."<br> - I'm an old resident.<br> - I did not mean you.<br> Didn't you? You know,<br> when I took you into my service,<br> everyone predicted<br> you'd put a knife in my back.<br> - And did you believe them?<br> - No.<br> I assured them that you were<br> a man of honor... and a collaborator.<br> That was accurate of you.<br> - How do you combine the two?<br> - My Lord?<br> Honor and collaboration.<br> I don't try. I love good living,<br> and good living is Norman.<br> I love life, and the Saxons'<br> only birthright is to be slaughtered.<br> One collaborates to live.<br> And honor?<br> Honor is a concern of the living.<br> One can't very well be concerned<br> about it once one's dead.<br> You're too clever for me, Thomas.<br> But I know there's something<br> not quite right about your reasoning.<br> Honor is a private matter within.<br> It's an idea, and every man<br> has his own version of it.<br> How gracefully you tell your king<br> to mind his own business.<br> Time for the council meeting, My Lord.<br> Ugh.<br> Will My Lord dine with me tonight?<br> - On gold plates?<br> - Always.<br> I am your king, and I eat off silver.<br> Your expenses are heavy.<br> I have only my pleasure to pay for.<br> Tonight you can do me the honor<br> of christening my forks.<br> - Forks?<br> - Yes, from Florence.<br> New little invention. It's for pronging<br> meat and carrying it to the mouth.<br> - It saves you dirtying your fingers.<br> - Well, then you dirty the fork.<br> - Yes, but it's washable.<br> - So are your fingers. I don't see the point.<br> It hasn't any, practically speaking, but<br> it's refined, it's subtle, it's very un-Norman.<br> You must order me some.<br> For my barons.<br> I have enough forks to go around.<br> Bring the gentlemen with you tonight.<br> I shall.<br> We won't tell them what they're for.<br> They'll probably think<br> they're a new kind of dagger.<br> (both laughing)<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> the council is open.<br> Gentlemen, I've called you here to<br> find out why a simple request for taxes<br> - causes such unpriestly caterwauling.<br> - My Lord...<br> We must come to an understanding<br> about who rules this kingdom, the church -<br> - My Lord, I wish to ask you -<br> - Just a moment, Archbishop.<br> The church or me.<br> There are many troublesome issues<br> between us which call for a reckoning.<br> Amongst other abuses<br> is the claim you make<br> of judging your clergy<br> accused of civil crimes<br> in your own ecclesiastical courts.<br> I warn you, there can be<br> only one justice in this country,<br> and that is the king's.<br> But before we quarrel,<br> here is some happy news.<br> I have decided to revive<br> the office of Chancellor of England,<br> keeper of the Lion's Seal,<br> and entrust it to our loyal servant<br> Thomas Becket.<br> Yes, my little Saxon?<br> My Lord?<br> Well, for once<br> I've taken you by surprise.<br> My Lord, this is a stupendous honor,<br> for which I may not be worthy.<br> I'm inexperienced in these matters<br> and frivolous by nature.<br> Rubbish. You know more than<br> all of us put together.<br> He's read books, you know. It's amazing.<br> He's drunk and wenched his way<br> through London,<br> but he's thinking all the time,<br> aren't you, Thomas?<br> He'll checkmate the lot of you.<br> Even you, Archbishop.<br> I never did anything without your advice.<br> No one knew it.<br> Now everyone will. That's all.<br> There.<br> That's the Great Seal of England.<br> Don't lose it.<br> Without the Seal, there's no more<br> England, and we'll all have to pack up<br> and go back to Normandy.<br> May I crave leave<br> to greet our young and learned friend,<br> for I noticed him<br> when he was first made Archdeacon.<br> Thank you, Archbishop, but don't rely<br> too much on Becket to play your game.<br> He's my man. I'd forgotten<br> you were an Archdeacon, Thomas.<br> So had I, My Prince.<br> Now to business.<br> The law demands that every landowner<br> send soldiers to give me service<br> or pay a tax in silver,<br> is that correct?<br> I have heard so, My Lord.<br> We are about to cross the channel<br> to force Louis of France<br> to return the Norman towns<br> he has taken from us.<br> I have received neither soldiers nor<br> silver from you, gentlemen, for this war.<br> But surely one must distinguish<br> between the individual landowner<br> - and God's church?<br> - The law doesn't distinguish.<br> - But this has never been spoken of before.<br> - I've never been this poor before.<br> No. I've made up my mind,<br> and I'm passing around the plate.<br> Just drop in the money.<br> Ooh. My backside's sore.<br> - Is that all? Count your blessings, sire.<br> - (belches)<br> I don't know about you, but I'm starving.<br> Have them bring us something to eat.<br> A layman who shirks his duty<br> and fails to supply his king with arms<br> should pay the tax.<br> - Nobody will question that.<br> - Least of all the clergy.<br> On the other hand, a priest's duty<br> is to assist his king with his prayers<br> for godliness and peace.<br> He cannot maintain men at arms<br> without violating the very essence<br> of that sacred function.<br> Therefore, he cannot be held<br> liable for the tax.<br> Your priests fought well enough<br> in the days of a conquest<br> when there was booty to be had.<br> Sword in fist, rumps in the saddle.<br> Death to Saxon scum.<br> It's God's will, it's God's will.<br> Those violent days are over.<br> The priest is back in his sanctuary.<br> - It is peacetime now.<br> - But not for long.<br> Pay up. I don't intend to budge.<br> Come on, Chancellor, say something.<br> Has your new title made you tongue-tied?<br> May I respectfully draw to My Lord<br> Archbishop's attention one small point?<br> Respectfully but firmly.<br> You're Chancellor now.<br> England is a ship.<br> The king is the captain of the ship.<br> That's neat. I like that.<br> My Lord Chancellor, in point of fact,<br> there is also a saying,<br> the captain is sole master after God.<br> After God!<br> Nobody's questioning God's authority,<br> Archbishop.<br> Most certainly God protects the ship<br> by inspiring the captain,<br> but I've never heard that he<br> determines the wages of the crew,<br> nor instructs the paymaster<br> in his duties.<br> God has more important business.<br> Our young deacon's ambition<br> has carried him away from the church.<br> But he cannot have forgotten<br> that what is important<br> is revealed to man<br> only through his church<br> in the person of our Holy Father in Rome,<br> his bishops and his priests.<br> Or does the chancellor think<br> otherwise?<br> True, there is a priest on board<br> every ship.<br> He gives God's blessings.<br> But neither God nor the church ask him<br> to take the wheel from the helmsman.<br> My Reverend Lord, the Bishop of London,<br> who I understand is the son of a sailor,<br> surely cannot have forgotten that.<br> I will not allow personal insinuation<br> to compromise the integrity<br> and honor of the church.<br> Please, Bishop, no long words.<br> All that's at stake here is its money.<br> I need money to fight the French.<br> Will the church give it to me?<br> Yes or no?<br> My Lord, your illustrious ancestor<br> William the Conqueror<br> granted these tax exemptions<br> to the church.<br> May he rest in peace.<br> Where he is now, he doesn't need money.<br> I'm still on Earth, and I do.<br> This is not primarily<br> a question of money, Your Highness.<br> This is a question of principle.<br> I need troops, Bishop.<br> I've sent for 3,000 Swiss<br> to help me fight the king of France<br> and no one has ever paid the Swiss<br> with principles.<br> - My Lord Chancellor...<br> - It is pointless to continue this discussion.<br> The law has given us<br> the means of coercion.<br> We will use it.<br> You - you owe everything<br> to Holy Mother Church.<br> Would you dare plunge a dagger<br> into her bosom?<br> My Lord and King,<br> who rules by the grace of God,<br> has given me his seal<br> with the three lions to protect.<br> My mother is England now.<br> Traitor! Saxon!<br> My reverend friend, I strongly suggest<br> that you respect my Chancellor,<br> or else I'll call my guards.<br> Ahh, here they are now.<br> Oh, no.<br> It's only my snack.<br> Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me,<br> at this hour in the morning<br> I need sustenance,<br> or else I tend to feel weak.<br> And a king must never weaken.<br> I'm sure you will agree.<br> I'll have it in my chapel.<br> Then I can pray directly afterwards.<br> Come on, Thomas, keep me company.<br> He means it's time for the hunt.<br> Not until we have eaten,<br> my dear Bishop.<br> (horn blowing)<br> - Race?<br> - Right.<br> Hyah!<br> (laughing)<br> Get!<br> (horn blowing)<br> - The king's hunt.<br> - Eh?<br> - Oh, inside, quick.<br> - (woman gasps)<br> Let's get under cover<br> before we're drowned.<br> We've lost the barons.<br> Oh, they'll find us.<br> Here. Hold this.<br> (shivers)<br> Oh, I'm cold, my pretty.<br> Go on, sit on there. That's a good girl.<br> Go on, get on there.<br> I'm freezing. Get the fire going.<br> - There'll be no wood in this house.<br> - In the middle of the forest?<br> These people are entitled to<br> two measures of deadwood a year.<br> One branch more, and they hang.<br> - My edict?<br> - Your edict.<br> (horses neighing)<br> Come here, old man.<br> We need firewood. Don't be afraid.<br> Thomas!<br> Thomas, come here!<br> Look at this.<br> She stinks a bit,<br> but we could wash her.<br> What would you think of it,<br> clean her up a little?<br> She's a child.<br> What would it be like<br> when it's a woman?<br> How old would you say it was, 16, 17?<br> It can speak, My Lord.<br> How old are you?<br> Eh?<br> Of course it can speak.<br> How old's your daughter, dog?<br> Odd, the number of dumb people I meet<br> when I set foot out of my palace.<br> - I rule over a kingdom of mutes.<br> - They're afraid.<br> Quite right, too. Don't stand there.<br> Put the wood on the fire.<br> Hello, pretty.<br> (laughs)<br> Look at it.<br> The odd thing is, it's so ugly,<br> yet it makes such pretty daughters.<br> You're a member of the family.<br> Explain that.<br> At 20, before he lost his teeth and took on<br> that ageless look common people have,<br> he may have been handsome.<br> He may have had one night of love,<br> one moment when he was a king<br> and shed his fear.<br> Afterwards, his pauper's life<br> went on eternally the same.<br> The moment faded, and he forgot it all,<br> but the seed was sown.<br> - Will she grow ugly, too?<br> - Surely.<br> If we made her a whore<br> and kept her at the palace,<br> - would she stay pretty?<br> - Perhaps.<br> Then we'd be doing her a service,<br> wouldn't we?<br> - No doubt.<br> - Ooh.<br> Look at it.<br> It understands every word.<br> Stop staring at me, dog!<br> Get me something to drink!<br> - I have some drink in my saddle.<br> - What's the matter, Thomas?<br> Nothing.<br> I'm getting you a drink.<br> - Thank you, Thomas.<br> - (horn blowing)<br> Our escort. Want some?<br> - What's the matter? You hurt?<br> - It's nothing.<br> Show me.<br> Now, you know you can't stand<br> the sight of blood.<br> My horse bit me.<br> (laughing)<br> That is too funny.<br> My Lord here makes us all look silly<br> at the jousts with his fancy horsemanship.<br> He goes to his saddlebags<br> and gets bitten like a groom.<br> You look quite shaken, little Saxon.<br> Funny, I can't bear<br> to think of you in pain.<br> All this just to get me a drink.<br> Wounded in the service of the king.<br> This deserves a gift.<br> What would you like?<br> This girl.<br> I fancy her.<br> That's very tiresome of you.<br> I fancy her myself.<br> And where that subject's concerned,<br> friendship goes by the boar.<br> All right, she's yours.<br> Thank you, My Prince.<br> But you will return the favor<br> equally one day.<br> At your pleasure.<br> Equally. Favor for favor.<br> You give me your word as a gentleman?<br> I do.<br> Right. She's yours.<br> Shall we take her with us,<br> or shall we have her sent?<br> No, no, no.<br> The soldiers can bring her.<br> (dogs barking/horn blowing)<br> Wash your daughter, dog,<br> and kill her fleas.<br> She's coming to the palace<br> for My Lordship here.<br> He's a Saxon, too,<br> so I hope you'll be pleased.<br> Give him money, Thomas.<br> I'm feeling generous this morning.<br> Don't worry about your daughter.<br> Nobody will come to take her away.<br> I'll see to that. And tell your son<br> he should stay hidden in the forest<br> until he can handle a knife better.<br> Here.<br> (men shouting/laughing)<br> - Ooh!<br> - (laughing continues)<br> Forgive me.<br> Not for fighting, my dear baron.<br> For eating.<br> (laughter)<br> (d singing)<br> (d singing)<br> (d singing stops)<br> Go on. It's lovely.<br> (d singing resumes)<br> - (d singing stops)<br> - (men shouting)<br> Noisy brutes.<br> You seem to spend a great deal<br> of time in their company.<br> No, I can forget it when I come to you.<br> I'm happy that I can relieve you.<br> Now, don't tease me tonight, Gwendolen.<br> I'm off to France again tomorrow,<br> and war.<br> I am My Lord's captive.<br> Whatever his purpose<br> and whatever his mood.<br> - I hope so.<br> - It is God's will,<br> since he gave the Normans<br> victory over my people.<br> - And that's the only reason you're here?<br> - If the Welsh had won the war,<br> I would have married a man<br> of my own race at my father's castle.<br> God did not will it so.<br> All right.<br> I'm sorry I was so late coming to you,<br> but the king is demanding,<br> and the barons<br> have to be kept at bay.<br> I'm lying.<br> You are my lord, God or no God.<br> If we had won the war,<br> you could just as easily have<br> taken me from my father's castle.<br> I would have come with you.<br> For you had taken my heart<br> before you captured my body.<br> Have I said something wrong?<br> Somehow I can never support<br> the idea of being loved.<br> - I told you that.<br> - (humming/footsteps)<br> (men continue shouting)<br> Oh, please.<br> Sit.<br> Uh, play something.<br> Something sad.<br> It helps the digestion.<br> Play.<br> (d singing)<br> Oh, sweet and melancholy.<br> (d continues singing)<br> Sit, Thomas.<br> Witness one of my finer moments.<br> I behave like a brute,<br> but I'm as soft as swans down inside.<br> (belches)<br> You know, Thomas,<br> sometimes I think that you and I<br> are the only civilized men in England.<br> I eat with a fork,<br> and you've made me into a man<br> of the most delicate sensibilities.<br> And now, if you really love me,<br> you should find me a beautiful,<br> well-bred girl to give me a little polish.<br> Favor for favor.<br> Do you remember?<br> I am your servant, My Lord.<br> All that I have is yours.<br> But you are also gracious enough<br> to say I am your friend.<br> Yes, that's what I mean -<br> as one friend to another.<br> You do care for her then?<br> You do care about something?<br> Or do you?<br> Go on, tell me.<br> Tell me if you care for her or not.<br> I said, "favor for favor,"<br> and I asked for your word.<br> And I... gave it to you.<br> Right.<br> Well, that's settled then.<br> May I have a moment's grace?<br> Surely. Surely.<br> After all, I'm not a savage.<br> Did you promise me to him?<br> No.<br> I promised him anything he asked for.<br> I never thought it would be you.<br> If he sends me away tomorrow,<br> will you take me back?<br> No.<br> I leave you this.<br> You've almost learned to play it.<br> You've not found anything in the whole<br> world to care for, have you?<br> - No.<br> - We both belong to a conquered race,<br> but you've forgotten<br> that people robbed of everything<br> can still have one thing left<br> to call their own.<br> Yes.<br> Where honor should be,<br> in me there is only a void.<br> I loved you,<br> Thomas Becket.<br> My Lord.<br> Enter.<br> How careless you are, Thomas.<br> You had forgotten her.<br> But you told me that you fancied her,<br> and I remembered.<br> You see, I really am your friend,<br> and you're wrong not to love me.<br> Good night, sire.<br> Shall I undress, My Lord?<br> What?<br> Shall I undress?<br> (laughs)<br> Thomas?<br> Thomas?<br> She's dead.<br> She's killed herself.<br> All this blood.<br> Help me, Thomas. I'm frightened.<br> I'm the king!<br> Get rid of her.<br> Guard.<br> I'm sleeping here tonight.<br> Give this girl a silver piece<br> and let her go.<br> He won't hurt you.<br> I don't want to be alone tonight.<br> I'm here, My Prince.<br> You'll hate me now.<br> I'll... I'll... I'll never be able<br> to trust you.<br> You have nothing to fear.<br> You gave me your seal.<br> And while I wear it,<br> my duty is to my king.<br> But I'll never know<br> what you're thinking.<br> Sleep now.<br> We cross the channel tomorrow.<br> When we face the French<br> on the field of battle, there will be<br> simple answers to everything.<br> So long as Becket must improvise<br> his honor from day to day,<br> he will serve you faithfully.<br> But what if one day he should meet<br> his honor in truth,<br> face to face?<br> But where is Becket's honor?<br> An early good morning to you, gentlemen.<br> I've just ridden from the town.<br> I've arranged for its capitulation.<br> Will there be loot?<br> No, I want these people<br> to collaborate with grace.<br> The French bishop will deliver<br> the keys of the city to the king<br> at eight o'clock in the cathedral.<br> No fighting?<br> What are we here for?<br> To secure King Henry's possessions<br> in France.<br> You have three more towns to recapture.<br> I'd rather sack the town<br> and slaughter the lot.<br> Yes, and have a dead city.<br> No, I want to give the king living cities<br> to increase his wealth.<br> From dawn this morning,<br> I'm the townspeople's dearest friend.<br> And what of England's pride?<br> England's pride, my dear baron,<br> is to succeed.<br> What a mentality.<br> Chancellor of England.<br> Who knows what he is.<br> He's a Saxon.<br> (grunting)<br> Release him.<br> - Leave us, Sergeant.<br> - My Lord?<br> Leave us.<br> What are you, a Saxon monk, doing<br> in France? They'll kill you, you know?<br> - I'm prepared to die.<br> - How old are you?<br> - 18.<br> - Hmm. Dying is easy at 18.<br> Your knife stinks of onions,<br> like every proper little Saxon's knife.<br> You used to be a Saxon.<br> Now you belong to the Normans.<br> Ah, I see.<br> A Saxon knife for a Saxon collaborator.<br> Did you think that by killing me<br> you could liberate your race?<br> - No, not my race. Myself.<br> - From what?<br> My shame... and yours.<br> The Normans have occupied England<br> for a hundred years since Hastings.<br> Shame is an old vintage to the Saxon.<br> Your father and your grandfather<br> drank it to the dregs.<br> - The cup is empty now.<br> - No, never.<br> What's your name?<br> What is your name?<br> John.<br> Sergeant.<br> Well, brother John,<br> I'm going to save your life.<br> It has no importance for me,<br> but it's very rare for fate to bring one<br> face to face with one's own ghost<br> when young.<br> - My Lord?<br> - Have this monk returned to England<br> to the custody of the abbot<br> of his monastery.<br> I want him treated without brutality<br> but carefully watched.<br> Yes, My Lord.<br> - (gargling)<br> - My Lord?<br> (gargling continues)<br> - Good morning, My Lord.<br> - (gargles)<br> Oh.<br> French wine.<br> I had a little too much last night.<br> It's their major contribution<br> to civilization.<br> - Here's another.<br> - (woman gasps)<br> I must say I adore my French possessions.<br> They're certainly worth recapturing.<br> What's your name, my pretty?<br> - Name?<br> - Marie.<br> Marie. Very French.<br> French luxury is very luxurious.<br> And for the moment, free.<br> We take possession of the town<br> this morning.<br> Yes, I heard.<br> You managed that very well, Thomas.<br> Personally, I shall miss the fighting.<br> Meanwhile, we have some business<br> to discuss.<br> I've been studying<br> the dispatches from England.<br> You love work, don't you?<br> If you love anything.<br> I love doing what I have to do<br> and doing it well.<br> You'd be as efficient against me<br> as for me, wouldn't you?<br> If fate had arranged it that way.<br> So what in most people is morality,<br> in you it's just an exercise in...<br> What's the word?<br> - Aesthetics.<br> - Yes, that's the word.<br> - Always aesthetics.<br> - Yes.<br> Well, now...<br> Look at that.<br> Isn't that aesthetic, too?<br> Some people go into ecstasies over<br> cathedrals, but that's a work of art.<br> Look at it.<br> Round as an apple.<br> Want her?<br> Business, My Lord.<br> All right, business. Sit down.<br> Listen carefully, Marie, to the droppings<br> of the greatest brain of our day.<br> (chuckles) I'm piecing together all<br> the information I've received from London.<br> There are unpleasant deductions<br> to be made.<br> The power of the bishops is increasing<br> like the pestilence.<br> - Soon it will rival your own.<br> - Talk sense, Thomas.<br> Priests are always intriguing,<br> but I can crush them anytime I wish.<br> If you don't crush them now, in five years'<br> time there will be two kings of England -<br> the Archbishop of Canterbury and you.<br> In ten years' time, there will be only one.<br> And it won't be me?<br> I fear not.<br> Grant to horse, Thomas, to horse.<br> War on the clergy, death to the archbishop.<br> My Lord, I can't breathe.<br> What are you doing down there,<br> spying for the clergy?<br> Be off with you.<br> Put on your clothes and go home.<br> My Lord, am I to come back<br> to the camp tonight?<br> Yes. No.<br> I don't know. I'm thinking of priests,<br> not you. Go away.<br> Wait. I'd rather be sure<br> I'm getting another one as good.<br> Yes, come back tonight.<br> You're adorable.<br> (giggling)<br> You must always tell them that,<br> even when you pay.<br> That's high politics, too.<br> Only one? It won't be me?<br> It won't be you.<br> But what will God say if I attack his<br> church? After all, they're his bishops.<br> We must manage the church.<br> One can always come to<br> a sensible little arrangement with God.<br> (laughs)<br> Becket, you're a monster.<br> You flatter me, My Lord.<br> But please, My Lord, dress quickly.<br> It's inelegant for conquerors to be late.<br> (laughing) You're a monster!<br> (crowd cheering)<br> You see, they love us dearly,<br> these French.<br> (laughs) So they should.<br> We paid them enough.<br> In that case, we should have found some<br> that didn't dress out of a rag barrel.<br> (cheering continues)<br> - The rich are at home sulking.<br> - Supporters of King Louis of France?<br> - No, it just would've cost too much.<br> - That sounds real.<br> Yes, we have soldiers disguised<br> in the crowd to encourage enthusiasm.<br> Why must you destroy<br> all of my illusions?<br> Because you should have none,<br> My Prince.<br> - What do you see?<br> - Reality.<br> Stop here!<br> - The bishop is waiting.<br> - As if it mattered what I do<br> - with a bishop whose city I've taken.<br> - It matters.<br> - Am I the strongest, or am I not?<br> - You are today.<br> But one must never drive one's enemy<br> to despair. It makes him strong.<br> Gentleness is better politics.<br> It saps virility.<br> A good occupational force<br> must never crush. It must corrupt.<br> Make a note of the house.<br> Oh, never mind.<br> - My Lord, the bishop.<br> - Yes, Papa. No, Papa.<br> Put your men at rest, Captain.<br> - Is this William of Corbeil?<br> - Yes, sire.<br> I hardly recognized you<br> without a tankard covering your face.<br> How did they pry you away from it?<br> I had urgent messages from London<br> for you, My Lord.<br> It seems that God<br> is on our side after all, Thomas.<br> What is that, My Prince?<br> He's just recalled the Archbishop<br> of Canterbury to his bosom.<br> That frail old man. He was the first<br> Norman to take an interest in me.<br> God rest his soul.<br> He will, he will.<br> And he'll be much more use to God<br> than he ever was to me.<br> Thomas.<br> An extraordinary idea<br> is creeping into my mind.<br> A masterstroke.<br> I'm suddenly very intelligent.<br> It probably comes from making love<br> to that French girl last night.<br> I'm subtle.<br> I'm even profound.<br> Oh, I'm so profound,<br> it's making my head spin.<br> (Thomas laughs)<br> - Are you listening to me, Thomas?<br> - I'm listening, My Prince.<br> We need a new<br> Archbishop of Canterbury.<br> I think there is a man we can rely on.<br> No matter who it is, once<br> the archbishop's miter is on his head,<br> he will not longer be on your side.<br> But if the archbishop is my man,<br> if Canterbury is for the king,<br> how could his power<br> possibly get in my way?<br> My Lord, we know your bishops.<br> Once enthroned at Canterbury, every<br> one of them will grow dizzy with power.<br> Not this man.<br> This is someone who doesn't know<br> what dizziness means,<br> someone who isn't afraid of God.<br> I'm sorry to deprive you<br> of the French girls<br> and the other spoils of victory, but...<br> - Are you listening to me, Thomas?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - You're leaving for England tonight.<br> - On what mission, My Prince?<br> You are going to deliver a letter<br> to all the bishops of England.<br> Uh-huh.<br> My royal edict nominating you,<br> Thomas Becket,<br> Primate of England,<br> Archbishop of Canterbury.<br> (laughing)<br> Shut up.<br> Thomas, I'm in deadly earnest.<br> My Lord,<br> don't do this.<br> You have an odd way<br> of taking good news.<br> I should think you'd be triumphant.<br> But I... I'm not even a priest.<br> You're a deacon.<br> You can be ordained priest<br> and consecrated archbishop the next day.<br> Have you considered<br> what the Pope would say?<br> I'll pay his price.<br> My Lord,<br> this frightens me.<br> I thought you had God<br> in the palm of your hand, Thomas.<br> I beg of you,<br> do not do this.<br> You've never disappointed me,<br> Thomas,<br> and you're the only man I can trust.<br> You'll leave for England tonight.<br> Becket?<br> Thank you for returning to us<br> the keys of our city.<br> The die is cast, Thomas.<br> Make the most of it.<br> And if I know you,<br> I'm sure you will.<br> (bell ringing)<br> - There you are.<br> - Thank you, My Lord.<br> - Thank you, My Lord.<br> - You're welcome. It will keep you warm.<br> - He'll only sell it for drink.<br> - Then that will keep him warm.<br> - Yes, Your Grace.<br> - No, not "Your Grace."<br> I will not be consecrated archbishop<br> until tomorrow.<br> - I'm sorry. Father.<br> - That is temporarily correct.<br> You don't really intend<br> to give away your winter cloaks?<br> Everything.<br> Has the gold plate been sold?<br> Yes, the money from the sales<br> is in those purses.<br> Excellent.<br> Bring me the rest of the money.<br> - But Your Grace, sir... I mean, Father...<br> - Everything.<br> Well, welcome to Canterbury,<br> My Lord Bishop. Is anything wrong?<br> May I ask what is happening here?<br> "Go sell all that thou hast<br> and give it to the poor,<br> - and thou shalt have treasure in heaven."<br> - I doubt if the Lord Jesus<br> meant that to apply to a chancellor<br> about to be consecrated archbishop.<br> Perhaps then it's a touch of vanity.<br> A truly saintly man I know<br> would never do all this in one day.<br> Let us call it the clumsy gesture<br> of a spiritual gatecrasher.<br> Most clever, an archbishop<br> who gives all so dramatically<br> to the people would be<br> most popular with them.<br> Oh, no, Folliot.<br> I'm simply enjoying all of this.<br> I'm beginning to believe he's not<br> a sad God after all.<br> Forgive me, I fear<br> my inexperienced methods<br> will never meet with your approval.<br> I know that you cast<br> the only vote against me.<br> In the end I gave way<br> to the king's wishes.<br> I don't blame your reluctance.<br> As Bishop of London<br> and senior churchman,<br> you should've been archbishop.<br> Now to have to consecrate me instead<br> and place the miter on my head.<br> I have no choice. I'm only<br> performing my function as bishop.<br> I see you still wear the seal<br> of the King's Chancellor.<br> Yes. I will continue to wear it -<br> that and the archbishop's ring.<br> You do not find this inconsistent?<br> No. God is best served when<br> the two rest side by side in harmony.<br> These excessive acts of humility will not<br> compensate for subservience to the crown.<br> Thank you. We are both aware<br> of the delicacy of my position.<br> Let us trust that God<br> will find a solution for it.<br> And now,<br> since humility seems to be<br> a little hard on the knees,<br> I trust you will be comfortable<br> under our roof, My Lord Bishop.<br> Dear Lord,<br> I wish there was something<br> I really regretted parting with<br> so that I might offer it to you.<br> But forgive me, Lord.<br> It's like going on a holiday.<br> I've never enjoyed myself<br> so much in my whole life.<br> Lord,<br> are you sure you're not<br> laughing at me?<br> It all seems far too easy.<br> (chanting in Latin)<br> It is a bishop's duty to pass judgment,<br> to interpret,<br> to consecrate, to ordain,<br> to offer sacrifice,<br> to baptize and to confirm.<br> Let us pray, beloved brother.<br> Let the goodness of Almighty God,<br> providing for the well-being<br> of his church,<br> may bestow upon this bishop elect<br> the abundance of his grace<br> through Christ our Lord.<br> (all) Amen.<br> (chanting in Latin continues)<br> May these hands be anointed<br> with hallowed oil,<br> with the chrism that sanctifies.<br> Even as Samuel anointed David<br> king and prophet,<br> so may these hands<br> be anointed and consecrated.<br> (chanting in Latin continues)<br> Take this ring,<br> token of the pledged word.<br> Yours it is,<br> donned with unshakable fidelity<br> to preserve and guard,<br> in unblemished honor,<br> God's bride, the Holy Church.<br> (chanting in Latin continues)<br> Lord, on the head of this bishop<br> and champion of thine,<br> I put the helmet of defense<br> and salvation,<br> that with forehead thus adorned,<br> head armed with the horns<br> of both testaments,<br> he may appear fearsome<br> to the enemies of truth.<br> (chanting in Latin continues)<br> (chanting stops)<br> (praying in Latin)<br> (praying in Latin)<br> (continues in Latin)<br> (continues in Latin)<br> (all) Amen.<br> (chanting in Latin)<br> (crowd cheering)<br> (cheering)<br> His Grace will receive you here.<br> It isn't every day that a Saxon monk<br> has an audience with an archbishop.<br> - Open your eyes.<br> - You'll kiss his ring<br> and show respect to His Grace, or<br> you'll get my foot on your backside.<br> You're welcome to Canterbury.<br> Kneel to His Grace.<br> I see our young brother<br> is quite unchanged.<br> - Has he been troublesome to his abbot?<br> - Stubborn as a mule, My Lord.<br> Father Abbott tried kindness,<br> but had to have recourse<br> - to bread and water, even to the whip.<br> - Nothing has any effect.<br> Except for a good kick in the rump,<br> if Your Grace will pardon the expression.<br> - Stand up straight.<br> - Pay attention to your brother.<br> As a rule, the sin of pride<br> stiffens a man's back.<br> Look me in the face.<br> Look me in the face.<br> Now, what do you have<br> to say for yourself?<br> I see.<br> Now, brothers, we relieve you for the day<br> from your rule of abstinence.<br> Go to our kitchen before you depart,<br> and I hope you'll do justice<br> to our cuisine.<br> - And this one?<br> - We will keep him here with us.<br> - He's vicious, Your Grace.<br> - We are not afraid.<br> Well, now, wouldn't you rather have<br> a Saxon archbishop than a Norman one?<br> I hope I won't regret sending for you.<br> Why did you?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Perhaps in a young, intemperate way,<br> yours is a voice that is good<br> for me to hear.<br> - Then why...<br> - But, please,<br> not too often<br> and not too loud, Brother John.<br> You betrayed your Saxon race.<br> Now you betray God.<br> Perhaps you will succeed in teaching me<br> humility. It's a virtue I've never mastered.<br> - (knock on door)<br> - Enter.<br> Your Grace, Bishop Folliot<br> has arrived from London.<br> He wishes to speak to you urgently.<br> Well, My Lord Bishop, what is it?<br> But, Your Grace?<br> You may speak freely. Brother John<br> is in our confidence. What is it?<br> Your Grace, I have a most<br> serious matter to report<br> which requires<br> your immediate intervention.<br> - Proceed.<br> - A parish priest in Lord Gilbert's domain<br> who is accused of debauching a young girl<br> has been seized by His Lordships' soldiers<br> and dragged before the civil courts.<br> - Is the priest guilty?<br> - That is immaterial.<br> As a consecrated minister of God,<br> he can only be tried<br> by our ecclesiastical courts.<br> You must demand his release<br> into church custody immediately.<br> - The principle is a vital one.<br> - Does the king know of this?<br> He knows, but he turns a deaf ear.<br> Lord Gilbert is his friend.<br> I'm also a friend of King Henry.<br> As chancellor, you are his friend.<br> But I wear the miter now.<br> You also wear the great seal<br> of England, and I warned you,<br> you could never do so honorably.<br> It is fortunate that I do.<br> I will plead our case to the king.<br> I did not come here<br> to ask you to plead a case.<br> I'm asking you to defend a principle,<br> and you'd better do so quickly,<br> Your Grace.<br> Thank you for your warning.<br> We appreciate your efforts to<br> chart the course<br> you would naturally have followed<br> had you become archbishop.<br> At least, Your Grace, I could never<br> have been accused of divided loyalties.<br> Should I go now?<br> - Can I go?<br> - (knock on door)<br> No. See who's outside.<br> This is Brother Philip, Your Grace.<br> He's come with a message<br> for the Bishop of London.<br> I told him he just left,<br> but now he insists on seeing you.<br> Your Grace, I wouldn't have<br> dreamed of disturbing you, but...<br> It's you who are disturbed,<br> Brother Philip. What is it?<br> I believe My Lord Bishop of London<br> came to you<br> to demand the custody<br> of the accused priest.<br> - Yes.<br> - The priest is dead.<br> - Dead?<br> - Yes.<br> He tried to escape, but<br> Lord Gilbert's soldiers caught him<br> and, in the presence<br> of his Lordship, killed him.<br> Thank you, Brother Philip.<br> You may retire.<br> Leave us now, Brother John.<br> My Lord Jesus,<br> I find it difficult to talk to you.<br> What can I say?<br> I, who have turned away from you<br> so often with indifference.<br> I have been a stranger to prayer,<br> undeserving of your friendship<br> and your love.<br> I've been without honor<br> and feel unworthy.<br> I am a weak and shallow creature,<br> clever only<br> in the second rate and worldly arts<br> seeking my comfort and pleasure.<br> I gave my love,<br> such as it was, elsewhere,<br> putting service to my earthly king<br> before my duty to you.<br> But now they have made me<br> the shepherd of your flock<br> and guardian of your church.<br> Please, Lord, teach me now<br> how to serve you with all my heart,<br> to know at last what it really is<br> to love,<br> to adore.<br> So that I may worthily administer<br> your kingdom here upon Earth<br> and find my true honor<br> in observing your divine will.<br> Please, Lord,<br> make me worthy.<br> You are a creature of extremes,<br> aren't you, Brother John?<br> Get up.<br> Forgive me.<br> I didn't know.<br> I never realized.<br> Nor did I.<br> Get up.<br> You were very good at admonishing<br> an archbishop.<br> Do you think you could talk<br> to a king?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good.<br> Then you will memorize what I write.<br> Henry?<br> - Henry?<br> - What is it, Mother?<br> Why do you keep<br> gazing out of the window?<br> Becket won't come, you know.<br> He's much too busy<br> giving money to the poor.<br> And fitting sandals on beggars.<br> I never liked him as an adventurer,<br> but now that he puts on<br> the airs of a saint...<br> He certainly keeps himself in splendid<br> isolation since you made him archbishop.<br> He's in retreat.<br> It's part of the ritual.<br> Anyway, I don't need<br> to be reassured by his presence.<br> - He's my friend.<br> - More is the pity.<br> He has a strange way<br> of showing gratitude.<br> Your friend. You mean you went<br> to the whorehouses together.<br> It was he who lured you away<br> from the duties you owed to me.<br> Madam, in matters of debauchery,<br> it was I who lured him.<br> And I didn't need anyone to lure me<br> away from the duties I owe you.<br> I made you four children<br> very conscientiously.<br> Thank the Lord my duty is done.<br> I pray heaven<br> he stays away from you.<br> When you realize how he has used you,<br> you may appreciate the joys<br> of family life again.<br> (children playing)<br> The joys of family life<br> are limited, madam.<br> To be perfectly frank, you bore me!<br> You and your everlasting backbiting!<br> - Stop this.<br> - And this eternal tatting of yours.<br> In God's name, how long does it take<br> to make a tapestry?<br> - And it's mediocre beyond belief.<br> - One performs according to one's gifts.<br> Yes.<br> (children playing)<br> - Oh!<br> - Come on, victory!<br> (all shouting)<br> Shut up, the lot of you!<br> - Which one are you?<br> - Henry III.<br> Not yet, sir! Number two<br> is in the best of health!<br> A fine way<br> you bring up your children, madam.<br> Do you see yourself<br> as regent already?<br> No wonder I shun your bed.<br> It's not amusing to make love<br> with one's own widow.<br> Who's that?<br> A messenger... from Canterbury.<br> If you can spare the time<br> from bullying your children.<br> Messenger?<br> Is your master ill?<br> No, Your Highness.<br> I have a message from His Grace.<br> - A message?<br> - These are Becket's words.<br> "Whereas men at arms<br> of the Lord Gilbert,<br> under his orders and in his presence,<br> have seized and killed<br> a priest of the church,<br> I, Becket,<br> Archbishop of Canterbury,<br> Primate of England,<br> do now ask that Your Highness,<br> in accordance<br> with the law of the Realm,<br> apprehend Lord Gilbert and charge him<br> with the crime of murder."<br> Well, my son, now you have<br> heard from your friend.<br> Get out!<br> Get out, both of you!<br> Take your royal vermin with you!<br> Your Highness,<br> is there a reply for the archbishop?<br> - Your Grace.<br> - Yes?<br> The king is here.<br> - Are you certain?<br> - He came mounted and alone,<br> - but I'm sure it's he.<br> - (footsteps)<br> - My Prince.<br> - Why did you send a messenger?<br> Canterbury's only five hours<br> from London.<br> I've just ridden it in four.<br> I'm frozen stiff.<br> - Would you like some wine?<br> - No. Give me a reason.<br> - Why did you send a messenger?<br> - What answer did you give him?<br> - You've arrived here before he has.<br> - (chuckles)<br> I detect ill, devious Becket here.<br> What game are you playing, Thomas?<br> No game, My Prince.<br> Lord Gilbert murdered a priest.<br> I want the guilty punished.<br> The guilty of what? This priest<br> was a scandal to his parish.<br> That was never proved.<br> Gilbert should've handed the accused<br> to the church for process of law.<br> If guilty, we would have determined<br> his punishment.<br> I am the law!<br> Gilbert will recourse to me.<br> I gave him leave to arrest this priest.<br> I can't allow my clergy to be thrown into<br> prison and tried by the civil authorities.<br> Neither can I stand by<br> and let my priests be murdered.<br> You? You can't allow?<br> You can't stand by?<br> Are you taking yourself seriously<br> as archbishop?<br> I am the archbishop, My Prince.<br> By my grace!<br> Are you demented? You're<br> Chancellor of England. You're mine.<br> I'm also the archbishop,<br> and you have introduced me<br> to deeper obligations.<br> And if I won't charge Gilbert?<br> I can't force you,<br> but there is always a final judgment<br> beyond the king's justice.<br> Oh, that. Lord Gilbert<br> will face his fate<br> on the day of judgment,<br> as we all will.<br> I'm sure he'll have more to answer for<br> than killing a felonious priest.<br> Lord Gilbert will come to that judgment<br> already damned, sire.<br> I intend to excommunicate him.<br> You are demented.<br> Don't you understand that when you<br> attack my nobles, you attack me,<br> and when you attack me,<br> you attack England?<br> There is more to England<br> than the crown.<br> You must learn to face that<br> eventually, My Prince.<br> Damn you, don't lecture me!<br> You once told me you didn't know<br> what honor was, and I laughed at you.<br> But now to betray me,<br> to challenge my power.<br> I do not seek power, My Prince.<br> It is only that I finally discovered<br> a real honor to defend.<br> Whose honor?<br> Whose honor is greater than the king's?<br> The honor of God.<br> Forgive me.<br> Hmm. You give the lions of England<br> back to me,<br> like a little boy<br> who doesn't want to play anymore.<br> I would have gone to war<br> with all England's might behind me<br> and even against England's interest<br> to defend you, Thomas.<br> I would have given away my life<br> laughingly for you.<br> Only I loved you<br> and you didn't love me.<br> That's the difference.<br> Stay away.<br> But thank you for this last gift<br> as you desert me.<br> Now I shall learn to be alone.<br> (chanting in Latin)<br> Bishop.<br> What do you want, Philip?<br> Your Majesty.<br> Alone without an escort?<br> The king, nevertheless.<br> Bishop, I wish to confess.<br> The king has his own confessor.<br> It is an important court prerogative.<br> Don't be nervous, Bishop.<br> I'm not asking for absolution.<br> I have something far worse<br> than a sin on my conscience.<br> A mistake,<br> a crass mistake.<br> I ordered you to vote for Becket<br> in the election at Canterbury.<br> - I repent of it.<br> - I bowed beneath the royal hand.<br> Very reluctantly, I know. I'm told<br> this compromise with your conscience<br> made you seriously ill afterwards.<br> - God cured me.<br> - Very good of him.<br> You wear his uniform<br> and have his ear.<br> He's let me fall ill<br> without lifting a finger,<br> and I must cure myself.<br> - I did not know of this...<br> - I have the archbishop on my stomach,<br> a big, hard lump<br> I shall have to vomit back.<br> I think you are a man<br> one can talk to, Bishop.<br> I believe I misjudged you.<br> Friendship blinded me.<br> Is the king's friendship<br> for Thomas Becket dead, Your Highness?<br> Yes, Bishop, it died quite suddenly,<br> a sort of heart failure.<br> A curious phenomenon, Your Highness,<br> but quite frequent.<br> I hate Becket now.<br> I hate him<br> as much as you are jealous of him.<br> He's like an animal tearing my guts.<br> I can't bear it anymore.<br> I shall have to turn it loose on him.<br> But I am the king,<br> and my office stands in my way.<br> I need someone to help me.<br> My only interest is for the church.<br> Oh, come, Bishop.<br> We're alone, and the church is empty.<br> The church is never empty.<br> The little red lamp<br> burns in the chapel<br> signifying God's presence<br> in the tabernacle.<br> (laughs)<br> Do you take me for one of<br> your sheep, Holy Pastor?<br> I like playing games,<br> but only with boys of my own age.<br> The one for whom<br> that little red lamp burns<br> has seen into your innermost heart<br> and mine a long time ago.<br> Of my hatred of Thomas Becket<br> and your envy of him,<br> he knows all there is to know.<br> Strange. I'd always taken<br> Your Highness<br> for a perennial adolescent<br> who cared only for his pleasures.<br> One can be wrong about people,<br> Bishop. I made the same mistake.<br> Now, if it could be proved<br> that Becket had committed some<br> gross impropriety as Chancellor,<br> say embezzlement,<br> what would the church do?<br> If that were established -<br> I say, if -<br> the bishops could legally dissolve<br> their allegiance to him<br> pending their report to the Pope.<br> - And beyond that?<br> - You, you would go beyond that?<br> The whole way.<br> In his guilt -<br> if he were found guilty -<br> he would then be charged<br> under canon law.<br> And the penalty?<br> That would be for Your Majesty<br> to decide.<br> - Thomas.<br> - You love him, don't you?<br> You still love him. That impostor,<br> that Saxon guttersnipe, that mitered hog.<br> Hold your tongue, Priest.<br> All I confided to you<br> was my hate, not my love.<br> For England's sake,<br> you'll help me get rid of him,<br> but don't ever insult him to my face.<br> He will be accused,<br> and you will play your proper part.<br> According to law.<br> I would spit<br> if I were not in God's house.<br> (bell ringing)<br> My brothers,<br> as you have been told,<br> your presence here is voluntary.<br> If any of you have second thoughts,<br> you may retire now.<br> Thank you for attending.<br> Good day, My Lords.<br> I did not expect to see you<br> at Canterbury.<br> Do you still disagree<br> with my decision?<br> Your Grace, can nothing<br> persuade you to delay?<br> Oh, yes. The king's arrest<br> of Lord Gilbert<br> on the charge of sacrilegious murder.<br> There will be an arrest,<br> but not Lord Gilbert's.<br> The sheriff of London<br> is waiting in the sacristy.<br> He has orders to summon you<br> before the king's grand justicer<br> the instant<br> you pronounce the excommunication.<br> - How curious. On what charge?<br> - Embezzlement.<br> The king finds that there are large<br> sums of money missing from the treasury<br> during your administration<br> as Chancellor.<br> - How much?<br> - 40,000 pounds in fine gold.<br> (chuckles)<br> There was never that much gold<br> in the whole treasury.<br> I beg of you, do not do this.<br> You will strike a blow that will split<br> church and state for a generation.<br> If I do not strike it now,<br> the church as we know it<br> will not survive a generation.<br> God will see that it survives.<br> No, the kingdom of God<br> must be defended<br> like any other kingdom.<br> Gentlemen,<br> it is a supreme irony<br> that the worldly Becket,<br> the profligate and libertine,<br> should find himself<br> standing here at this moment.<br> But here he is,<br> in spite of himself.<br> But the King, for good or ill,<br> chose to pass the burden<br> of the church onto me,<br> and now I must carry it.<br> I've rolled up my sleeves<br> and taken the church on my back.<br> Nothing will ever make me<br> set it down again.<br> Now, Lords,<br> if you will forgive me.<br> (chanting in Latin)<br> Lord Gilbert,<br> baron of England, by the grace<br> of His Majesty, King Henry II,<br> seized upon the person of a priest<br> of the holy church<br> and unlawfully did hold him in custody.<br> Furthermore,<br> in the presence of Lord Gilbert<br> and by his command,<br> his men seized upon this priest<br> when he tried to escape<br> and put him to death.<br> This is the sin<br> of murder and sacrilege.<br> In that<br> Lord Gilbert has rendered<br> no act of contrition or repentance<br> and is at the moment<br> at liberty in the land,<br> we do here and now separate him<br> from the precious body and blood<br> of Christ<br> and from the society of all Christians.<br> We exclude him<br> from our Holy Mother Church<br> and all her sacraments<br> in heaven or on Earth.<br> We declare him excommunicate<br> and anathema.<br> We cast him into the outer darkness.<br> We judge him damned with the devil<br> and his fallen angels<br> and all the reprobate<br> to eternal fire<br> and everlasting pain.<br> (all) So be it.<br> (chanting in Latin)<br> As the Lord Sheriff of London,<br> I'm commanded to summon you,<br> Thomas Becket, to the king's court<br> on the charges herein set forth,<br> stamped with the king's seal.<br> I, Robert de Beaumont,<br> Duke of Leicester,<br> Grand Justicer of the Realm,<br> do now summon Thomas Becket<br> to this court of law<br> for the third and last time.<br> Thomas Becket, step forward.<br> He's doomed, isn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> - At last.<br> I forbid you to gloat.<br> At seeing your enemy perish?<br> Why not?<br> Becket is my enemy,<br> but in the human balance,<br> traitor that he is<br> and naked as his mother made him,<br> he's worth 100 of you, madam,<br> with your crown and your jewels<br> and your august uncle the emperor<br> into the bargain.<br> I'm forced to fight him now<br> and crush him,<br> but at least he gave me<br> with open hands<br> everything that is at all good in me,<br> and you have never given me anything<br> but your carping mediocrity<br> and your everlasting obsession<br> with your puny little person<br> and what you thought was due to it!<br> That's why I forbid you to smile<br> while Becket is being destroyed!<br> I gave you my youth.<br> I gave you your children.<br> I don't like my children!<br> And as for your youth,<br> that withered flower<br> pressed between the pages of<br> a hymn book since you were 12 years old<br> with its watery blood<br> and stale insipid scent,<br> you can bid farewell to that<br> without a tear.<br> Your body was an empty desert,<br> madam,<br> which duty forced me<br> to wander in alone.<br> But you have never been a wife to me.<br> And Becket was my friend -<br> red-blooded,<br> generous and full of strength.<br> - Oh, my Thomas.<br> - And I?<br> I have given you nothing, I suppose?<br> Life, yes.<br> Thank you.<br> But after that I never saw you except<br> in a passageway on your way to a ball,<br> or in your crown and ermine mantle<br> when you were forced to<br> tolerate my presence.<br> No! No one on this earth has ever<br> loved me except Becket!<br> Call him back then.<br> Absolve him if he loves you.<br> Give him back his power,<br> but do something.<br> I am.<br> I'm learning to be alone.<br> (d trumpets)<br> By the authority granted me,<br> I, Robert de Beaumont,<br> servant of the crown,<br> do now, before this council,<br> charge Thomas Becket<br> with the crimes of -<br> Robert.<br> - I charge you, Thomas Becket -<br> - Robert de Beaumont,<br> hear me for the sake of your soul,<br> which is in the gravest danger.<br> All in this assembly know how faithfully<br> I've served my lord the king.<br> It was he who willed<br> that I be archbishop,<br> and it was for love of him alone<br> that I accepted.<br> I am innocent of any wrongdoing<br> in my administration of the king's treasury<br> as chancellor or at any other time.<br> I therefore refuse to plea<br> to these trumped-up charges.<br> I will be judged<br> by the Pope alone,<br> to whom before you all<br> I now appeal and place myself<br> and my church under his protection.<br> As head of the Church of England<br> and as your spiritual father,<br> I forbid you to pass judgment on me.<br> I command you<br> and all who would charge me<br> to hold your peace<br> on pain of endangering<br> your immortal souls.<br> Well played, Thomas.<br> (men murmuring)<br> Do you think you can carry this off<br> indefinitely, you fool?<br> We are all God's fools, My Lord.<br> Becket,<br> you are a liar!<br> You are a traitor!<br> Sheathe your sword, Morville,<br> before you impale your soul upon it!<br> (chuckles)<br> It's funny. It's too funny.<br> He's made mincemeat of them.<br> I'm surrounded by fools!<br> Becket is the only intelligent man<br> in my kingdom, and he's against me!<br> (laughing)<br> - Your Highness, it was impossible -<br> - Shut up. Get to your feet.<br> Did you hear him?<br> He appeals to the Pope.<br> If he gains the Pope's ear, Bishop,<br> we may find the entire kingdom<br> under Papal interdict.<br> I could be excommunicated myself.<br> But, Your Highness,<br> I do not think that -<br> I want no more thinking!<br> Becket must not cross the channel.<br> King Louis of France would be<br> the first to help him get to the Pope.<br> The archbishop must not leave<br> England. See to it.<br> From now on, Bishop,<br> it is total war.<br> Psst!<br> My French knight<br> takes your English bishop.<br> - Your Majesty's adroit.<br> - Pardon, sire.<br> Too snug. Why do all tailors want<br> to strangle one's armpits?<br> Your Majesty, the English ambassador's<br> extraordinary<br> insist that I convey their compliments.<br> They've already done that.<br> I'll see them when I'm ready.<br> That's my job.<br> They wish respectfully, sire,<br> to call your attention to the fact<br> that they have been waiting<br> for three days.<br> Let them wait. That's their job.<br> Ambassadors are paid to pace about<br> in anterooms,<br> especially in these times<br> of uneasy peace.<br> But they have an urgent communication<br> from Henry of England, sire.<br> The king of England and his<br> ambassadors can drown themselves<br> in what they are impertinent enough<br> to call their English Channel.<br> But, Your Majesty, the extradition<br> of a criminal is a courtesy due<br> from one crowned head to another.<br> My dear man, crowned heads are free<br> to play the little game of courtesy,<br> but nations owe one another none.<br> Oh.<br> All right, show them in,<br> show them in.<br> No, you may stay.<br> The ambassadors can share<br> our attention with our tailor.<br> It will demonstrate to the English<br> that exact social status of our court.<br> May I be permitted to present to Your<br> Majesty the two envoys extraordinary<br> from His Highness, Henry of England,<br> His Grace, the Bishop of London<br> and Robert de Beaumont,<br> Duke of Leicester.<br> Welcome, My Lords.<br> Fresh from England?<br> How is our good King Henry?<br> He was well, Your Majesty,<br> when we left him two weeks ago.<br> Two weeks to cross the channel?<br> Gentlemen.<br> We have been waiting upon Your Majesty<br> for three days.<br> - Why was I not informed? Girot.<br> - Your Majesty?<br> See what I have to contend with?<br> But perhaps I can make it up to you.<br> Would you permit me to furnish you<br> with some French garments<br> made by our craftsmen here?<br> - It will only take two weeks.<br> - We thank Your Majesty,<br> but we have urgent business in Rome.<br> Too bad.<br> Well, is there anything else<br> I can do for you?<br> I wish to deliver a message<br> from Henry, King of England<br> to his friend Louis,<br> King of the French.<br> - We are all ears.<br> - He wishes you to know -<br> Oh, just one moment.<br> - Yes, do continue.<br> - He wishes you to know<br> that Thomas Becket,<br> Archbishop of Canterbury,<br> has been found guilty of treason<br> and has forthwith fled his kingdom.<br> He therefore entreats you<br> not to allow this criminal<br> to reside within your territories,<br> nor to permit any of your vassals<br> to give counsel or support to him.<br> He solemnly declares that your enemies<br> would receive none from him,<br> nor from his subjects.<br> Henry, King of England,<br> Duke of Normandy.<br> Gentlemen, we have listened<br> most attentively<br> to your sovereign's gracious request,<br> and we shall shortly be drafting<br> a formal reply to it.<br> In the meantime, however, we can<br> only express our astonishment.<br> No news has reached us of the Archbishop<br> of Canterbury's presence in our domains.<br> But, sire, we have word<br> that he is in your domains.<br> He's taken refuge<br> in the Abbey of San Martin.<br> My Lord Bishop, we flatter ourselves<br> there is some order in our kingdom.<br> If he were there, we should<br> most certainly had been informed.<br> Bring in Thomas Becket.<br> Rise, Thomas Becket, and greet us<br> as the Primate of England.<br> The bow would've been enough.<br> And if I know my etiquette,<br> you were entitled to<br> a slight nod of the head from me.<br> That's done.<br> I might also be required to kiss the ring<br> if this visit were an official one,<br> but I am under the impression<br> that it isn't.<br> No, sire. I'm only an exile.<br> That, too, is an important title<br> in France.<br> I'm told you are a dangerous one.<br> - I'm afraid so, sire.<br> - How delightful.<br> Shall we discuss it in private?<br> We enjoy danger, Becket.<br> It keeps us alive.<br> - Do you value candor?<br> - I do, sire.<br> Then let me tell you that were you<br> a French official,<br> I might have kept you into<br> prison myself.<br> For the moment, however, we are pleased<br> to grant you our royal protection.<br> I humbly thank you, Your Majesty,<br> but I'm bound to tell you<br> that I cannot buy your favor<br> with any act hostile to my country.<br> You do us an injustice.<br> That was understood.<br> I believe that in the past, however,<br> you have been no stranger<br> to the art of political maneuver.<br> That is true, sire.<br> Well, speaking frankly,<br> you suit our purpose in our chess game.<br> England is splitting into<br> the Henry camp and the Becket camp,<br> and that suits us admittably.<br> We ask nothing further of you.<br> But... There is always a "but,"<br> as I'm sure you are aware.<br> I am aware.<br> I am responsible only<br> for France's interest, Becket.<br> Unfortunately, I cannot afford to<br> shoulder those of heaven as well.<br> For the moment, it suits me to<br> shelter any fugitive from Henry's court.<br> His recent impertinence<br> in claiming and capturing<br> some of our frontier towns<br> must be well known to you, Thomas,<br> since you more than distinguished yourself<br> in several of these engagements.<br> In a month or so, however, my dealings<br> with Henry may require a different tactic.<br> I might even be obliged<br> to ask you to leave France.<br> I hope to have a solution<br> to such a dilemma.<br> - Oh?<br> - I intend to go onto Rome<br> to put my case before the Holy Father,<br> if you will give me safe conduct.<br> You shall have it, of course.<br> You're the ideal guest.<br> But might I be permitted<br> to give you a word of advice?<br> - I would appreciate it.<br> - The Pope is a most holy man,<br> but like so many lofty personages,<br> he is surrounded by men<br> of a somewhat inferior stamp.<br> They need money. And King Henry<br> might be willing to provide it.<br> Keep your eyes open.<br> I will.<br> But permit me to show you my aviary.<br> That man Becket smacks<br> of too much sincerity.<br> A practice that is most disconcerting.<br> Fiddlesticks. Sincerity is a form<br> of strategy just like any other.<br> In a pinch I have been known<br> to use it myself.<br> The trouble is, if your opponent starts<br> being sincere at the same time you do,<br> then the game becomes<br> horribly confusing.<br> Shh.<br> I assure you, Your Holiness,<br> it's a simple matter.<br> No, no, no, Zambelli,<br> I don't agree.<br> It is impossible.<br> If we take the money from King Henry,<br> I cannot possibly receive Becket.<br> Receive the money from the king,<br> very Holy Father,<br> and receive the archbishop, too.<br> The one will neutralize the other.<br> You know what they say<br> Becket is going to ask me.<br> - No, Holy Father.<br> - Zambelli, don't play the fox with me.<br> It was you who told me.<br> I beg your pardon, Holy Father.<br> I had forgotten.<br> Or rather, as Your Holiness<br> asked me the question,<br> I thought you had forgotten,<br> and so I took a chance and -<br> Zambelli, if you start out<br> maneuvering yourself to no purpose,<br> we'll be here all night.<br> Well, bring him in.<br> His Holiness will receive you now.<br> I'm sorry to be importunate,<br> Your Holiness, but time is running out,<br> and my course concerns<br> the very life of the church in England.<br> I know, I know.<br> And your cause is worthy.<br> But nevertheless, Becket,<br> the church must seek<br> to exist peacefully<br> within the framework of the state.<br> I sought that with desperation,<br> Your Holiness.<br> Precisely, Becket.<br> You are new to God's service,<br> and perhaps for that reason,<br> you were somewhat hotheaded<br> and intemperate in your methods.<br> You have proved your moral worth,<br> but you have also split the church<br> in England into two parties,<br> and that is regrettable.<br> Holy Father,<br> I fear this may be true.<br> And it has given me much agony.<br> If I'm guilty,<br> if my judgment was wrong,<br> then I am most sincerely repentant.<br> Unfortunately, that doesn't solve<br> the problem.<br> Holy Father, relieve me<br> of the title of archbishop.<br> Let me be an ordinary priest.<br> - All right, done.<br> - Zambelli.<br> Why do you request this?<br> Then Your Holiness could make<br> a free and open decision.<br> The protection of my position<br> as head of the English church<br> may prove an embarrassment<br> I would like to relieve you of.<br> No.<br> That would mean<br> our total surrender to the state.<br> You will maintain your status<br> as archbishop,<br> but you will, for the present,<br> maintain it in a monastic retreat.<br> Where do you wish us to send you?<br> To the Abbey of San Martin<br> in France.<br> I ask only that my former servant,<br> Brother John,<br> be allowed to accompany me.<br> Of course.<br> God grant you peace, Thomas Becket.<br> (door closes)<br> That man is obviously<br> an abyss of ambition.<br> - How long a retreat?<br> - A very long retreat.<br> I wouldn't count on it.<br> Wait till he tastes the food<br> at the monastery.<br> (cattle lowing)<br> You look concerned, Your Grace.<br> Is something wrong?<br> - No, Brother John.<br> - You are unhappy here?<br> No, perhaps I'm too happy.<br> - Can I help?<br> - No, only God can help.<br> Lord,<br> what do you really want me to do?<br> To remain here, a poor monk<br> in simplicity of spirit,<br> is it a path to bring me nearer to you?<br> Or is too easy a way,<br> perhaps even a luxury?<br> The path to holiness in this monastery<br> is too effortless.<br> I think it would be too easy<br> to buy you like this.<br> Bargain price.<br> It has pleased you<br> to make me archbishop<br> and to set me like a solitary pawn<br> face to face with the king<br> on the chessboard.<br> I think you mean me<br> to defend your honor,<br> peacefully if I can,<br> with argument and with compromise.<br> And if I cannot,<br> then with the full challenge of my office<br> and the soaring force<br> of what I know to be right.<br> So...<br> I shall take up the miter again<br> and the golden cope<br> and the great silver cross...<br> and I shall go back<br> and fight with the weapons<br> it has pleased you to give me.<br> All the rest...<br> thy will be done.<br> Look, Thomas,<br> your king awaits you.<br> I'm glad you weren't born<br> on this side of the channel, Thomas.<br> You'd have been a thorn<br> in my side, too.<br> How did you bewitch me<br> into doing this for you?<br> I convinced you that<br> if the king and I reconciled,<br> he will be placed in your debt.<br> True.<br> Why does he hate you so?<br> He's never forgiven me<br> for preferring God to him.<br> Go, Thomas.<br> You know, it's a strange thing,<br> but Becket's safety<br> has become quite dear to me.<br> You look older, Thomas.<br> So do you, My Prince.<br> - You cold?<br> - I'm frozen stiff.<br> Chilblains are killing me.<br> You love it, of course.<br> You're in your element, aren't you?<br> Just that monk's habit.<br> I always told you one must fight the cold<br> with the cold's weapons.<br> Strip yourself naked<br> every morning and...<br> (together) ...splash yourself<br> with cold water.<br> I used to...<br> when you were there to make me.<br> I never wash now. I stink.<br> How's your son?<br> He must have come of age.<br> He's an idiot<br> and sly like his mother.<br> Thomas, don't you ever marry.<br> You took that matter out of my hands<br> when you had me ordained.<br> If we start on that, we're sure to quarrel.<br> Talk about something else.<br> Very well.<br> Has Your Majesty done much<br> hunting lately?<br> Yes, every day.<br> It doesn't amuse me anymore.<br> Becket, I'm bored.<br> My Prince,<br> I wish I could help you.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> For the honor of God and the honor<br> of the king to become one.<br> That may take long.<br> Yes, that may take long.<br> I'm the King, Thomas,<br> and so long as we are on this earth,<br> you owe me the first move.<br> I'm prepared to forget a lot of things,<br> but not the fact that I am king.<br> - You yourself taught me that.<br> - Never forget it, My Prince.<br> You have a different task to do.<br> You have to steer the ship.<br> And you - what do you have to do?<br> To resist you with all my might<br> when you steer against the Lord God.<br> What do you expect of me then?<br> Are you hoping I'll weaken?<br> No.<br> I'm afraid we must only do,<br> absurdly,<br> what it has been given to us to do<br> right to the end.<br> Look, suppose we come down to earth<br> and use words that make sense<br> to a boor like myself?<br> Otherwise, we'll never get anywhere.<br> And there'll be two frozen statutes<br> trying to make their peace<br> in a frozen eternity.<br> My Lord, I was doing my best<br> to make you understand.<br> I'm an idiot then!<br> Talk to me like an idiot.<br> Will you lift the excommunication<br> you pronounced on Lord Gilbert?<br> No, because it's the only weapon<br> I have left<br> to defend what was given<br> into my care.<br> Will you agree to the ten proposals which<br> the Bishop's accepted in your absence,<br> particularly to the surrender of priests<br> who seek the protection of the church<br> to escape my courts of justice?<br> No. My role is to defend my sheep.<br> And they are my sheep.<br> But I shall agree to the nine other<br> articles in a spirit of peace<br> and because I know you must remain<br> king in all and of all,<br> save the honor of God.<br> All right.<br> I will give way on this one point<br> in memory of our past friendship.<br> You may return to England.<br> Thank you, My Prince.<br> I meant to go back in any case<br> and give myself up to your power.<br> For in all things that concern this earth,<br> I owe you obedience.<br> We're finished now.<br> And I'm cold.<br> I feel cold, too... now.<br> You never loved me, did you,<br> Thomas?<br> Insofar as I was capable of love,<br> yes, I did.<br> Did you start to love God?<br> You mule!<br> Answer a simple question!<br> Yes.<br> I started to love...<br> the honor of God.<br> I should never have seen you.<br> It hurts too much.<br> - My Prince.<br> - No, no pity. It's dirty.<br> This is the last time I shall come<br> begging to you. Go back to England.<br> Farewell, My Prince.<br> I sail tomorrow.<br> I know that I shall<br> never see you again.<br> How dare you say that<br> when I've given my royal word?<br> Do you take me for a traitor?<br> Thomas!<br> Sit.<br> Come here, you.<br> Sit here.<br> You look to me, sir, not your mother.<br> Sit, you witless baboon.<br> What is the meaning of this?<br> Henry, what are you doing?<br> I know very well what I'm doing,<br> madam.<br> Out.<br> Before you fill your bellies,<br> we have something to announce.<br> Reviving an ancient custom,<br> we have decided to have our successor<br> crowned in our lifetime.<br> We do this to protect the kingdom<br> from future pretenders to the throne.<br> - Henry, this -<br> - Shut up.<br> Stop dribbling<br> while I raise you to glory.<br> To my successor,<br> Henry III.<br> Henry III.<br> When will the coronation take place?<br> As soon as we arrive in England.<br> - Where, may I ask?<br> - You may well ask.<br> - At York.<br> - Not at Canterbury?<br> My good mother, gentlemen,<br> is hinting with her customary delicacy<br> that there is a double purpose<br> to this mummery.<br> There is.<br> We are going to show<br> our freshly reinstated archbishop<br> that we can still do without him.<br> A coronation of the English king<br> is the most jealously guarded<br> privilege of Canterbury.<br> (chuckles) I'd give anything<br> to see Becket's face<br> when he learns he's lost it,<br> and that York has got it.<br> (laughing)<br> Ah, that will fix him.<br> Get out of there, you young cretin.<br> You're not crowned yet.<br> What a look.<br> Filial devotion<br> is a beautiful thing.<br> You'd like to be the real king,<br> wouldn't you, you little pig?<br> With that number three after your name<br> and Papa good and stiff in his tomb.<br> Well, you'll have to wait a bit.<br> Papa is well.<br> Papa is very well indeed.<br> My son, you know<br> I've always been against<br> any reconciliation<br> with that wretch Becket.<br> You know I understand<br> your hatred for him,<br> but do not let it lead you into an action<br> which you may bitterly regret.<br> This boy is not clever.<br> Ambitious men will use him against you<br> long before you cease to reign.<br> I'm still very much alive, madam,<br> and in control.<br> Henry, for all our sakes,<br> think of England<br> and not of your disappointed love<br> for this man.<br> Love? Love?<br> A moment ago, it was hate.<br> And what gives you the right, madam,<br> to meddle in my loves and hates?<br> You have an obsession about him<br> which is unhealthy and unnatural,<br> and now that he no longer<br> gives you comfort -<br> - Oh, God.<br> - If Thomas Becket were a faithless woman,<br> you'd behave no differently.<br> Sweet Jesus, you'd tear him<br> out of your heart.<br> Oh, if I were a man.<br> Thank God, madam,<br> he gave you breasts.<br> An asset from which I derived<br> not the slightest benefit.<br> I was let out to be suckled<br> by a peasant girl.<br> That no doubt is why it is so difficult<br> to see the king beneath your crown.<br> (chuckles) So you have something<br> to add, my lady.<br> Well, go on, add it.<br> Add it.<br> Get it out of you<br> once and for all in one great whine.<br> Let's hear the poison<br> you've accumulated.<br> I pity you.<br> I tolerated your mistresses, sir,<br> but do you expect me<br> to tolerate everything?<br> Becket! Always Becket!<br> I am a woman, I am your wife,<br> I am a queen!<br> I'll complain to my father!<br> I'll complain to my uncle the emperor!<br> I'll complain to all the kings of Europe!<br> I'll complain to God!<br> (laughing)<br> If I were you, madam,<br> I'd start with God!<br> Go to your chapel and see if he's at home!<br> Get out, the pack of you. I retch<br> with boredom at the sight of you!<br> To the devil with my whole family -<br> if he'll have you!<br> And as for you,<br> young Henry III,<br> here's my royal foot<br> up your royal buttocks!<br> (laughing)<br> Ah, that's better.<br> Let us drink, gentlemen.<br> Let us drink<br> till we roll under the table<br> in vomit and oblivion.<br> My faithful hounds.<br> It's warm beside you,<br> like beasts in a stable.<br> Good sweat.<br> Comfortable nothingness.<br> Not the least glimmer inside<br> to spoil the fun.<br> And to think before I met Becket,<br> I was like you,<br> a well-oiled machine<br> for belching,<br> whoring and punching heads.<br> What did you put in mine, Thomas,<br> that stopped the machine?<br> Tell me, do you ever think?<br> Never, sire.<br> A gentleman has better things to do.<br> (laughs)<br> Here, drink up.<br> What's the news from England?<br> Has Becket landed?<br> He has landed, sire.<br> Was no one there to receive him?<br> Lord Gilbert, for example?<br> Oh, he was there, damned<br> and excommunicate as he still is.<br> But there were seven bishops there<br> charging his soldiers<br> not to cause bloodshed<br> and give the light of the safe conduct<br> you gave Becket.<br> Yes. I gave him safe conduct.<br> The peasants escorted him<br> from village to village.<br> They cheered him<br> all the way to Canterbury.<br> Not a single gentleman,<br> not a single Norman showed his face.<br> - Only Saxons?<br> - Yes.<br> Swarms of them.<br> Becket left England a fugitive,<br> an exile.<br> He's returned there<br> to find an affection<br> that people have always saved<br> for their king.<br> A man who ate my bread.<br> A man I raised from nothing.<br> A man I loved.<br> Yes,<br> I loved him.<br> I loved him,<br> and I still do.<br> Enough. Oh, God, enough.<br> Stop.<br> Stop.<br> (grunts)<br> I can do nothing.<br> I'm as useless as a woman.<br> So long as he's alive,<br> I tremble,<br> I shake.<br> I'm the king,<br> and yet I shake.<br> (sobs)<br> Will no one rid me<br> of this meddlesome priest?<br> A priest who mocks me.<br> Are all around me cowards,<br> like myself?<br> Are there no men left in England?<br> (gasping)<br> It's my heart.<br> It's too fast.<br> Too fast.<br> It's too...<br> (gasping continues)<br> Thomas.<br> (bell ringing)<br> Make haste.<br> It's difficult with all these little laces.<br> It warrants a woman's hands.<br> A man's hands are better today.<br> What's worth doing<br> is worth doing well.<br> Yes.<br> If it's worth doing,<br> it's worth doing well.<br> Do up all the laces,<br> every one of them.<br> I must look my best today.<br> God will give us time.<br> There, that's done. But I just as soon<br> had cleaned out our pigsty at home.<br> It's not half so much hard work.<br> - Are you fond of your pig?<br> - Yes, I was.<br> At my father's house we had pigs,<br> too, when I was a child.<br> Did you now?<br> Will it... be today?<br> It's possible, my son.<br> - Are you afraid?<br> - Oh, no, not if I have time to fight.<br> All I want is the chance<br> to strike a few blows first,<br> so I shan't have done nothing<br> but receive them all my life.<br> If I can kill one Norman first,<br> just one,<br> that'll seem fair<br> and right enough to me.<br> - Are you so set in killing one?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> I don't mind if I am<br> just a grain of sand in a machine,<br> because I know by putting more and more<br> grains of sand in a machine,<br> one day it'll come grinding to a stop.<br> And on that day, what then?<br> Well, we'll have a fine,<br> new, well-oiled machine<br> in place of the old one,<br> and this time we'll put the Normans<br> into it instead.<br> That's what justice means, doesn't it?<br> Now give me my silver cross.<br> I must hold it.<br> My Lord, it's heavy.<br> A good swipe with this,<br> and they'd feel it.<br> Lucky little Saxon.<br> For you that would settle all accounts<br> in this black world, wouldn't it?<br> There, Lord.<br> I am ready,<br> adorned for your festivities.<br> Come. Let us go to the altar.<br> (bell rings)<br> Your Grace.<br> Your Grace.<br> There are armed men at the doors.<br> - I bolted the doors, but...<br> - It's time for vespers.<br> Does one bolt the doors during vespers?<br> I've never heard of it.<br> But, Your Grace?<br> Open them.<br> Everything must be as it should be<br> for divine service.<br> (pounding on door)<br> (pounding on door)<br> (pounding on door)<br> (praying in Latin)<br> (all continue in Latin)<br> (door opening)<br> It is here now,<br> the supreme folly.<br> This is its hour.<br> One does not carry arms into God's house.<br> What do you want?<br> Your death.<br> We will continue with the service.<br> Saxon!<br> Dog!<br> Traitor!<br> Oh, Lord,<br> how heavy thy honor is to bear.<br> Poor Henry.<br> - (whipping)<br> - (gasping)<br> (gasping continues)<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, yes, it was all agreed.<br> I forgive you... pigs.<br> Saxon pigs.<br> They certainly wanted<br> their money's worth.<br> - Is there a large crowd outside?<br> - Yes, sire.<br> There's nothing more certain to<br> win them over<br> than the sight of a king doing penance<br> and humbling himself under the lash.<br> The honor of God, gentlemen,<br> is a very good thing,<br> and all things considered,<br> one gains by having it on one's side.<br> Thomas Becket, our friend,<br> always used to say so.<br> Tonight in council,<br> we will determine what punishment<br> his murderers should receive.<br> Sire, they are unknown.<br> Our justice will seek them out,<br> you may be sure.<br> It is a time, my dear barons,<br> for all of us to do penance.<br> (crowd murmuring)<br> (crowd murmuring)<br> Hear me!<br> People of Canterbury<br> and citizens of England,<br> as I have submitted myself to the lash,<br> so have I petitioned the Pope.<br> And this day,<br> I have received his answer.<br> Thomas Becket,<br> former Archbishop of Canterbury<br> and martyr to the cause<br> of God and his church,<br> shall henceforth be honored<br> and prayed to in this kingdom<br> as a saint.<br> (crowd cheering)<br> Is the honor of God<br> washed clean enough?<br> Are you satisfied now, Thomas?<br>
