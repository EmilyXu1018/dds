                        Amelia!<br> Did you think we were going to forget you?<br> And not say good bye,<br> and see you go without a kiss?<br> Elizabeth!<br> Lines to Amelia upon leaving Miss Pinkerton's academy.<br> Farewell, farewell, sweet friend of childhood years.<br> Let sorrow not detain thee,<br> nor our tears.<br> Thy wings have grown, they seek another nest.<br> I can't... I can't... Oh, Amelia!<br> Our pretty, poor Amelia. Now she will never hear<br> the end of that tender poem.<br> Oh, well, there's too much bad poetry<br> in the world anyway.<br> But Becky, haven't you a single tear<br> for the years you've spent here?<br> No, my sweet, tears are not expected of charity pupils.<br> Oh, no, no tears. Humility.<br> Gratitude for an education not so very useful,<br> but, oh, so genteel.<br> And curtsies for the leftover food<br> of the second table.<br> And the lovely frocks that the other girls<br> will no longer wear.<br> Oh, no, Laura. No tears.<br> We orphans must learn that the luxury of emotion<br> is for our betters.<br> Miss Pinkerton herself.<br> Miss Sedley. As you now leave us to return<br> to the polished and refined bosom of your family...<br> you depart rich in those virtues and accomplishments<br> which characterize the young English gentlewoman.<br> In Music, Dancing and Orthography<br> you have realized our fondest hopes.<br> And in the principles of religion and morality<br> you have proved yourself worthy<br> of this establishment.<br> Receive then, dear child, this elegantly bound copy<br> of the illustrious Dr. Johnson's dictionary<br> as a token of my affection.<br> A dictionary!<br> It shall always rest under my pillow.<br> Miss Sharp!<br> The time has come...<br> Oui, oui, mademoiselle. je veux vous faire mes adieux.<br> Be good enough to respond in the English tongue.<br> Oh, dear, Miss Pinkerton, I'd quite forgotten<br> that you can't quite understand French.<br> For a moment I thought I was talking<br> to my dear dead mother, whose language it was.<br> But who could blame me or any of us<br> for thinking of you as a mother?<br> Miss Sharp, what I meant to say was<br> you are about to go forth into the world alone,<br> unaided, to exist by the fruits of your labor.<br> I hope you go with the feeling of gratitude<br> for the gift you have received within these walls.<br> Oh, mum, what other feeling is possible?<br> Not one of hatred, certainly.<br> Not one of wanting to leave this place.<br> Or a feeling that you took me because I was useful.<br> Mercy, wasn't it a joy teaching the younger girls<br> Music and French<br> and knowing how much money I saved for you?<br> Oh, it was, it was.<br> Goodbye, then.<br> Oh, this dictionary, for you.<br> Miss Pinkerton. Mr. Joseph Sedley, mum.<br> Enter, sir.<br> Joseph!<br> Ahhh!<br> Dearest Jos.<br> Bless my soul, it must be you, is it?<br> Now, Jos, how many sisters have you?<br> Monstruous clever of you to put it that way.<br> Monstruous clever.<br> Welcome to Chiswick Mall, sir.<br> Your servant, mum.<br> Your sister's belongings are ready.<br> Splendid! Meredith!<br> Fetch my sister's trunk.<br> And now let us kiss our little friends, Amy,<br> and then be on our way.<br> Adieu, dear friend.<br> Oh, my Becky, to think we must part now.<br> Yes, part.<br> Where will you go? What's going to happen to you?<br> Does it matter?<br> Thank Heaven you're safely cared for.<br> Becky, permit me, my brother Joseph.<br> Your servant, mum.<br> Who's coming to take you away, darling?<br> The dilligence?<br> Public conveyance?<br> It will have to do.<br> I have no gallant brother to claim me.<br> But my four horses claim you,<br> that are waiting outside.<br> Miss Sharp's travelling arrangements<br> have already been made.<br> What is your destination?<br> I have no destination.<br> Not until I find a home. Oh, a room, a garret,<br> any pillow to lay my head upon.<br> Amelia, is this true? Not a pillow to her name?<br> No, it isn't true. No longer.<br> Becky, you're coming home with me<br> until you find suitabele employment somewhere.<br> No, no, I mustn't burden you.<br> Oh, you angel.<br> Huzzah! I shout Huzzah!<br> My man will seek your trunk presently.<br> I feel it my duty to warn you.<br> I can't abandon her. She has nobody.<br> Nobody.<br> Goodbye, Miss Pinkerton. Goodbye!<br> Bye! Bye Amelia!<br> Goodbye, goodbye!<br> Miss Pinkerton! Words are but little thanks.<br> Yet let this speak volumes.<br> Back to your rooms!<br> For you, Becky.<br> I shall press this one too.<br> I've kept all of your dear flowers.<br> Becky, I don't know what to say to you.<br> By Jove, dare I call you my...<br> Your what, Joseph?<br> My bird?<br> Or something similar?<br> I wonder if your George Osborne in there<br> is calling Amelia something similar?<br> How I admire men who do not hesitate<br> to express their emotions.<br> I offer you my heart, my true affection.<br> I offer you love, Amelia, and a lifetime of devotion.<br> Now you've heard us both, the choice is yours, madam.<br> Why do you make it so difficult for me?<br> Two little boys I grew up with.<br> How am I to choose between them?<br> Am I to say no to you, William,<br> whom I've always respected?<br> Or to you, George, whom I've always...<br> Always...<br> Loved, Amelia, loved?<br> Admired.<br> Let him be your choice, then. Take George.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> I shall love you nonetheless, always.<br> Only I shall think of you as a sister.<br> A sister who is married to my best...<br> my oldest friend.<br> William Dobbin, no man had a truer friend.<br> By Jove, that scoundrel kissed my sister's hand.<br> I'll make him marry her.<br> Too late, Joseph.<br> The question has just been popped.<br> What? Why, I didn't realize it.<br> Why, that's beautiful.<br> What a handsome best man you'll make.<br> Only I'll not be there to see you.<br> I'll be gone by then.<br> Not if Joseph Sedley has anything to do with it.<br> How can Joseph Sedley keep me here?<br> By offering you the continued hospitality<br> of his father's home.<br> You're too noble. But if you were to keep me here any longer<br> I should never want to leave.<br> I'd dream that I could stay forever.<br> See you about me, receive your roses.<br> An idle dream, isn't it Joseph?<br> I... I...<br> A foolish unrealizable dream.<br> But I must face the world, look for employment,<br> Becky, Becky, don't,... I...<br> What is it, Joseph?<br> Do you care?<br> Do I care? Why I...<br> When I think of you without a home, I...<br> I'm completely a man... a man.<br> I... I...<br> Becky!<br> Becky, I've news to tell you, such wonderful news.<br> George...<br> Has asked for your hand and you accepted him.<br> Oh, my little blushing bride.<br> You are happy?<br> You'll never know how happy, you're not in love.<br> Perhaps I am.<br> Perhaps I too have given my heart.<br> And you never told me about it.<br> We wanted to surprise you.<br> Joseph is so shy, so timid.<br> Our Joseph?<br> Oh, Becky, you poor, poor girl.<br> Poor? Is Joseph so undesirable a match?<br> Oh, then it must be I.<br> Father would never approve.<br> I know him, he...<br> I understand.<br> I've reached above my station. I've no fine pedigree.<br> Stop, Becky. Father has ambitions for Joseph.<br> He plans to send him to India on government service.<br> Wise father. Don't weep precious.<br> I'll marry one of these days some worthy tradesman.<br> A draper, a greengrocer, someone humble<br> fit to my position.<br> Present my compliments to your father<br> and say that I'm leaving tonight.<br> And good luck to Joseph, the civil servant.<br> The government needs men of courage, decision,<br> men who are brave.<br> Well, here we are. Don't be making up your mind<br> too soon if you'll be wanting to stay here.<br> Are those... are they my pupils?<br> Ay, brood of Satan, that's what they are.<br> Well, you see, for better or worse,<br> you're at Queen's Crawley.<br> The food's bad, the service hard,<br> and the pay miserly.<br> I arranged for the position through correspondence.<br> Sir Pitt Crawley told you about all this in his letter,<br> did he?<br> Of course he didn't. He blessed the devil himself<br> a drive in the bargain.<br> For the last time, what is all that noise for?<br> Stop or it'll be the death of you!<br> Silence, have you lost your minds?<br> Quiet, you hear me?<br> Children, your governess.<br> Come and meet them.<br> Now. Try and make ladies and gentlemen of them.<br> This is their brother.<br> Nothing better that they for his cold ears.<br> I welcome you under our roof tree.<br> May you find peace and happiness here.<br> Peace and happiness, he says!<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> I don't think I've had sufficient training<br> for the position your father so kindly offered me.<br> If you would so inform the Baronet.<br> He inform the Baronet?<br> Hasn't the Baronet ears of his own to hear?<br> Bless you, Missy. I am Sir Pitt Crawley<br> and these are my children.<br> Quiet! Quiet!<br> Quiet!<br> That's another son.<br> As worthless a scoundrel as ever wore<br> the King's uniform.<br> Then you'll not be staying, eh?<br> Pucks take it...<br> Why, you're the prettiest governess I've ever<br> had my hands on.<br> Sir Pitt, as I was saying, although I haven't had<br> enough experience for so exacting a position,<br> I should like to accept.<br> These dear little children have completely<br> won my heart.<br> You'll live to regret it.<br> But I'm glad.<br> My name is Becky, darlings.<br> Would you like me to read you a pretty story?<br> No!<br> And here I bring you "The Blind Washerwoman of Moorefield".<br> A moral and instructive volume.<br> Mr. Pitt, it's kind of you, but I haven't yet finished<br> "Thrump's Legacy" that you brought me last week.<br> Read them both, then, read them both.<br> Works by pious authors are soothing to the soul.<br> What was that about the soul, Pitt?<br> Let me hear it too.<br> You know how your sermons always affect me.<br> You are too far sunk in the morass of iniquity,<br> my beloved brother, for my sermons.<br> I hope to see you later, Miss Rebecca.<br> Now I must work on my speech<br> for the questionable Aid Society.<br> Questionable Aid Society.<br> How on earth do you stand him, Becky?<br> What choice have I?<br> I must watch the side my bread is buttered on.<br> Why bread when that little mouth<br> was made for cake and kisses?<br> I know the two of you would willingly supply the second.<br> Oh, not enough.<br> Not half so nourishing as bread.<br> On the contrary. Every kiss counts, Becky.<br> I'm returning to London tomorrow.<br> Regimental duty.<br> London is such a large town.<br> So many willing lips to please a soldier.<br> Yes, but none like yours.<br> Becky, these pretty little hands,<br> who will hold them when I'm gone?<br> They'll be very busy.<br> Washing Violet, combing Rose,<br> mending Sir Pitt's shirts.<br> Oh, blasted, you shouldn't be doing all that.<br> Becky, if I were to ask you to come to London...<br> to find a position for you.<br> I've tried all that<br> No, Queen's Crawley is my haven.<br> Oh, but there must be something.<br> Some... Becky, wait!<br> I have an aunt in London.<br> Young and pretty, of course.<br> No, old and a spinster, but rich.<br> I can persuade her that she shouldn't stay alone.<br> That she needs a companion.<br> And I need a protector, Rawdon.<br> Becky!<br> Becky Sharp!<br> Can't you hear me? Where is that girl?<br> Sharp! Sharp! Sharp!<br> Miss Crawley, mam. Are you perhaps calling<br> Miss Sharp, mam?<br> No! I'm calling on heaven<br> to help me preserve me calm!<br> Where is me drops? Where is me jelly?<br> Am I to sit here and be murdered with inattention?<br> Where in blazes is that misbegotten girl?<br> Miss Crawley, mam,<br> if I may venture the opinion, mam...<br> Miss Sharp has left the house, mam.<br> Probably on some dark amorous errand.<br> Some dark amorous errand, eh?<br> I wouldn't put it past her.<br> I've been watching her for weeks.<br> A smile for the butcher, and a smile for the baker.<br> That girl hasn't a principle to bless herself with.<br> That's what I like about her.<br> What are those weeds doing here?<br> You know how vegetation nauseates me.<br> But these were brought by your nephew, mam.<br> Captain Crawley.<br> Very cozy nosegays.<br> Throw it out! And throw my nephew out too.<br> What the devil is he doing around here<br> every single day?<br> Well, that's not hard to guess, mam.<br> Miss Sharp has a way of blinking,<br> and a way of winking.<br> What? Are you suggesting that my nephew<br> would as much as notice that girl?<br> How dare you? Show him in.<br> And get Miss Sharp for me.<br> Go to her room! Get her!<br> Don't you come back here without her!<br> Yes, mam.<br> Oh, my head, my head.<br> I know I shall get the wafers.<br> Miss Crawley is awaiting you, sir.<br> Dear Aunt Julia.<br> Well, sir, to what am I indebted<br> for the question of the honor of this visit?<br> To the affection of a devoted nephew.<br> And do devoted nephews always get themselves<br> oiled and barbered to call on their maiden aunts?<br> Or did you hope to find Becky Sharp at home?<br> Answer me!<br> Becky, eh?<br> Now I will not have you so much as look at Becky.<br> Remember that!<br> That girl will twist you round her little finger.<br> But Aunt Julia, I assure you...<br> Don't assure me, sir, I assure you!<br> I will indulge and I've been generous. I've paid your card debts<br> and I've laughed at your extravagance!<br> But I'll not have you ensnared<br> by any calculated little snip of a menial.<br> The woman you marry must be a lady.<br> And a lady of quality!<br> How dare you come bounding into the room like this.<br> Just as I knowed. Miss Sharp's not in her room.<br> She's not in the house.<br> There isn't a stitch of clothing in the closet<br> and there's a trunk all packed.<br> Trunk? Packed? Well, where is it?<br> Bring it here! Instantly!<br> Well, well, well...!<br> Do you expect me to go for it myself?<br> Hurry! Hurry!<br> Who is it now?<br> Am I never to have any peace?<br> Rawdon, put that brandy down!<br> Hards and spirits are for invalids only.<br> Give it to me.<br> Mr. Pitt calling, mam.<br> That pewling hypocrite!<br> Don't you dare show him in!<br> Well, sir. Isn't London difficult enough<br> without your presence?<br> Here you come, reeking with the vulgar<br> urges of the country.<br> Madam, I've been sent by my good father.<br> That old ruffrub prate, what does he want?<br> My father wishes to know if you still have need<br> of Miss Rebecca'a services.<br> I certainly haven't, but neither has he.<br> Sir Pitt is lonesome, madam, very lonesome.<br> If he's lonesome, let him join Napoleon at Elba.<br> Then they can both be lonesome together.<br> Ah, good!<br> The trunk, mam.<br> Bring it here.<br> Open it!<br> Now we shall see what we shall see.<br> Angels of Bath!<br> What the deuce is this?<br> Not what a respectable female I should gaze on.<br> And look at this!<br> Pantomime. And an orange wig!<br> Confound you, leave her things alone.<br> She's acting on my orders, Rawdon.<br> Here's her rouge...<br> Ah, cosmetics, sinful, sinful.<br> Give me that.<br> And here is Becky Sharp herself.<br> Wait! It's Becky's own handwriting.<br> "A Portrait of my Mother".<br> Becky Sharp's mother a dancer?<br> At the risk of contradicting you, mam,<br> Miss Sharp's mother was an aristocrat.<br> A French lady by the name of Montmorency.<br> You're wrong, Rawdon.<br> I have it on Miss Rebecca's own authority<br> that her mother's name was Denier.<br> Here it says<br> "a portrait of my mother by my father".<br> A painter fellow?<br> And I had it on Becky's own authority that her father<br> was distinguished and rich.<br> I don't care what that blasted thing says.<br> I don't believe a word of it, not a single word of it.<br> Believe it, Mr. Crawley.<br> Believe anything, everything!<br> Only these relics, they're mine, sacred to me.<br> And no hand shall ever touch them but my own.<br> How well I remember that sweet smile.<br> Her portrait painted in exile.<br> This is how she looked always when she'd bend over my bed,<br> singing me to sleep.<br> Yes, my mother was a dancer. She danced herself<br> and she taught others to dance.<br> But she was an aristocrat.<br> Oh, make no mistake about that.<br> A Montmorency of the finest blood of France.<br> And that was the thing for which<br> she was exiled by the Revolution.<br> Her chteau burned, her estate confiscated,<br> her fortune taken from her.<br> Yes, she danced. Danced to feed her baby,<br> her only child.<br> To clothe me, to shelter me!<br> Do you wonder now why I treasure these things<br> that remind me of my mother?<br> Oh, this string of beads!<br> Miss Rebecca! Don't.<br> Not all diminishes when the heart is pure.<br> How dare you! Apologize to Miss Sharp at once!<br> Miss Sharp, we apologize...<br> Poor girl!<br> We were so unjust to her.<br> A little brandy, please.<br> Send for Dr. Crackenbush.<br> I know I'm going to die.<br> We must all part when the hour cometh.<br> Come in.<br> Becky, darling, why didn't you tell me?<br> Do you suppose I would have cared who your mother was,<br> how you were brought up?<br> Why did you have to hide things from me?<br> If you had led my life you would want to hide<br> something even from yourself.<br> Oh, tell me, are you sorry about yesterday?<br> I Sorry? My Becky darling, you're my wife now,<br> my own sweet wife.<br> Your wife! We've been married less then 24 hours<br> and already you doubt my words.<br> I don't, darling. I only want to know...<br> Know? Want more? Still more? Endlessly?<br> Do you want to hear about my father?<br> How he drank? How drink killed his talent,<br> his hopes, his wife?<br> When he beat her. And when I begged him<br> "Daddy, Daddy, don't strike her, strike me!".<br> What do you think he did?<br> I'll tell you: he struck me.<br> Oh, my sweet Becky. My poor darling.<br> Oh, don't pity me, perhaps I'm lying.<br> Perhaps I'm inventing the story as I go along.<br> I don't care, I still love you.<br> Oh, that's what I wanted to hear.<br> Love me, Rawdon. Love me.<br> I've had so little love in my life.<br> I've been kicked about so much.<br> Take me away from here.<br> Oh, but Becky, we couldn't do that.<br> My aunt would disinherit me.<br> Who cares if she does?<br> We mean more to each other than money.<br> Oh, darling, get a hackney coach.<br> Come for me when it's dark.<br> Oh, why did I want you, my silly?<br> What have you? Not a penny, not a plan , not ambition.<br> But we'll make out, my Rawdon, we'll make out.<br> Life owes me many things and I intend to get them.<br> All it takes is the least touch of wit.<br> Oh, don't look so disturbed.<br> I don't expect you to supply the wit.<br> That's my dowry to you.<br> Lieutenant Osborne, you silly!<br> I'll not have you saying such things in my house.<br> Marriage is far too sacred to jest about.<br> Amelia, did you hear what your husband said?<br> No, darling.<br> He said Rawdon was prolonging our honeymoon<br> just to scare other men away from me.<br> George is such a wit.<br> Yes, both of you are, dear.<br> Do you think I've done justice to your treasure,<br> Lieutenant Osborne?<br> Beautiful, so delicate.<br> Is that all the praise I deserve?<br> Oh, Amelia, your husband's embarrassing me.<br> He simply doesn't respond to art.<br> Don't be too critical, love.<br> Your beauty is too gentle to reproduce.<br> Becky, how talented you are.<br> It's lovely...<br> George, what the deuce is keeping you?<br> We want you back in the game.<br> Oh, George, please don't play anymore.<br> You've lost so much lately.<br> Oh, let him play.<br> Gambling is an agreeable vice for a young man.<br> We can't afford it. We're already in debt.<br> In debt?<br> Lo, my precious, look about you.<br> This is the house that debt built.<br> Why, I'm wearing a debt dress, standing on a debt rug.<br> We must owe money to every shopkeeper in London.<br> We mustn't, but we do. Come on, George.<br> Let me touch your hand. It will bring you luck.<br> Gentlemen, I said ace and I keep my word.<br> It's still pretty short.<br> Why not, it's quite earned.<br> Where's your lady, Rawdon? She promised<br> to stand behind my chair and bring me luck.<br> She promised me that.<br> That's the way she entices Rawdon's victims.<br> To the victims she pays no favors,<br> does she, gentlemen?<br> George, would you like to throw an eight?<br> How many years since I heard you play last?<br> It was on your own harpsichord.<br> How I envied you for it.<br> But then I envied you for so much.<br> For all that you had and I didn't.<br> Becky, you envied?<br> You didn't pay any attention to me at all.<br> You were too busy with Joseph.<br> That fat brother of yours?<br> Oh, how you all worried for fear I'd marry him.<br> That's why poor Joseph was shipped off to India,<br> wasn't it?<br> Becky, you know Father...<br> Never mind that.<br> That's all forgotten.<br> That's the past.<br> Oh, Becky. You're the most generous,<br> the most forgiving darling.<br> Becky. Amelia.<br> Captain Thorndyke has just told us.<br> Napoleon has escaped from Elba.<br> Napoleon?<br> Napoleon?<br> War?<br> War, yes.<br> Our regiment will be ordered to Belgium.<br> How terrible!<br> How amusing!<br> Becky! What are you saying?<br> What luck! What incredibly dazzling luck!<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> Yes, I'm crazy for joy!<br> War! Belgium! A new start!<br> What have we here? Debts.<br> Tradesmen getting nasty! Bills!<br> And why do you think our luck will improve<br> in Brussels?<br> Because...<br> we'll force it to.<br> Silver, aren't they pretty?<br> I found them in a little curiosity shop<br> and I couldn't resist them.<br> Seven.<br> Seven again.<br> Becky!<br> And don't imagine I'll ever use them.<br> How silly you are. You look so frightened.<br> They happened to amuse me.<br> I had no idea they were loaded.<br> Not for us, are they, dear?<br> That's not the way to coax Lady Luck.<br> Not your way.<br> By Gad, no.<br> No, sweet, no.<br> Remember what's ahead of us. Brussels! Brussels!<br> Everyone will be there. Officers with their wives.<br> The best people, the richest people.<br> Society! A new life, Rawdon.<br> Oh, we should be very grateful to Napoleon.<br> Darling.<br> Now I understand why Wellington keeps us<br> in Brussels.<br> England expects every man to do his duty...<br> nightly.<br> Now, General, don't make me sorry I invited you.<br> I shall send you home.<br> To be thrown out by the Duchess of Richmond<br> is the beginning of a social career.<br> Impossible man!<br> Don't listen to him. I adore it here.<br> So breathtaking, so brilliant.<br> Always the danger of a sudden attack.<br> No danger, my dear.<br> There will be no fighting till the Prussians join us.<br> Mrs. Crawley, a waltz, a single waltz.<br> No, don't ask me, not a waltz.<br> Can't I pressure you, Mrs. Crawley?<br> That's just what I was afraid of.<br> Such an immodest dance,<br> don't you think, Prince, all cling and swing.<br> It's the dance of the angel.<br> A fallen angel.<br> Mama, she slapped Papa.<br> That was Papa Mrs. Crawley slapped.<br> Pay no attention, Blanche.<br> You're too fine to notice such vulgarity.<br> Oh, that slap. What memories of my folks.<br> Would you believe, mum,<br> Mrs. Crawley honored Myers once by slapping him?<br> Why, the inelegant creature.<br> Whatever induced the Duchess of Richmond<br> to invite a mere ex-governess?<br> If I may, gentlemen, I'm weakening.<br> I find it impossible to choose from among you.<br> Then choose me, Becky.<br> Becky?<br> Don't you know me?<br> Have I changed so much in these few years?<br> Oh, no, it isn't you. It can't be.<br> Not Joseph Sedley.<br> The name sounds familiar to me, mam.<br> By Jove, Becky, it's good to see you.<br> You haven't changed a bit. I could have picked you out<br> from amongst the regiment.<br> I'm still the same little girl<br> who wasn't good enough for you to marry.<br> Don't say that, Becky. You know I'd have married you<br> in a moment if it hadn't been for those elephants.<br> You know, it was father who shipped me off to India<br> to hunt the blasted pachyderm.<br> I know, your dear little sister Amelia<br> told me all about it.<br> But, then, what were you doing in India, Jos?<br> Your son?<br> Becky! You blacken my character.<br> No, I collected taxes and butterflies for the Prince.<br> I gave him a lot of butterflies.<br> I'd rather hear about the taxes.<br> Come, let's make Rawdon listen.<br> Rawdon? Where is he?<br> Three eights, good for six<br> and one for his knob, seven.<br> Sorry, old chap, my game again.<br> As usual.<br> It's nothing but luck, eh, Rawdon?<br> Nothing but luck, George.<br> There you go, then I owe you 30 pounds.<br> Rawdon, George!<br> I brought you a dear, old friend.<br> Hello, Rawdon.<br> I've already seen Joseph, all of him.<br> Well, you've been neglecting me all evening.<br> Take me for a dance, George.<br> Joseph will play your silly cribbage.<br> Oh, Rawdon, perhaps you'll let him beat you<br> at billiards.<br> Billiards? I haven't touched a cue for three years.<br> Although we have a similar game in India.<br> Except we play it with one ball and a mallet<br> on horseback.<br> I'm dying for a dance.<br> No, I want to talk to you.<br> Here.<br> Now you shall give me my answer.<br> I'm not very good at giving answers.<br> I seldom listen to the questions.<br> You'll listen to this one.<br> Why didn't you reply to my letter?<br> Because only very silly people put such things<br> in writing.<br> Rawdon can read, you know.<br> What if he had seen your letter?<br> Or somebody had whispered about it into Amelia's<br> pearly little ears.<br> It's too late for me to be concerned<br> about Amelia.<br> You and I are going away.<br> Are we?<br> I love Rawdon, always remember that.<br> I remember it daily.<br> I remember when I lose to him 10 pounds, 50 pounds.<br> I tell myself it'll buy so much lace,<br> so much silk for Becky.<br> Champagne, servants. You've been expensive, Becky,<br> but I lost willingly.<br> Now, I've no more. I'm in debt.<br> Have you ever tried to borrow?<br> Not a bad method.<br> There's no one left to borrow from.<br> But that doesn't matter, does it?<br> You don't care anything about money.<br> You make such charming conversation.<br> Why do you deprive Amelia?<br> Becky, listen to me.<br> No, I don't want to go in there.<br> I can't bear to see them together.<br> Becky on George's arm.<br> George is either dancing with her or losing at cards<br> to her husband.<br> Oh, William, I can't do anything, I'm helpless.<br> I'll take Becky for a dance.<br> And after the dance?<br> She'd find him again, trust her.<br> If I could only make George understand.<br> And there's another thing I didn't like<br> about your letter.<br> You misspelled every other word.<br> Oh, hang my spelling. Don't play with me.<br> Is there someone else?<br> No.<br> Who is that man?<br> Oh, I intended just a homey, intimate affair.<br> A little singing, dancing.<br> Oh, my dear, dear Lord Steyne.<br> Dear Lord Steyne, I've been looking for you.<br> I thought you were hopelessly lost.<br> Your Grace must blame the Polish Ambassador.<br> Diplomatic secrets?<br> Not at all, the Ambassador too has chosen to bring his wife.<br> She has won me over completely<br> to the Polish cause.<br> At least to the better half of the Polish cause.<br> Tell me, what is his name?<br> I want to know.<br> How perfect your instincts are, Becky.<br> The Marquess of Steyne, Steyne with his millions.<br> Bigger game, eh?<br> Will you tell me about Napoleon?<br> I'm so interested in him.<br> Is there any danger here in Brussels?<br> No, madam, as far as I know,<br> Napoleon is many leagues away.<br> Is it true that the King of Prussia is bent<br> on leading his own army?<br> Really? When did he lead an army?<br> I wish I could whisper to you what the Czar Alexander<br> told me about that.<br> Milord, you hobnob with all the crowned heads<br> of Europe.<br> No, only with those that still remain<br> on their royal shoulders.<br> You see, dear Lady Bareacres,<br> royal heads have been known<br> to hop away from their bodies, especially in France.<br> Remarkable how many people managed<br> to come tonight.<br> Lady Blanche, I was so sorry to hear<br> of your mother's misfortune.<br> I do hope the operation was successful.<br> To think of her going blind at her age<br> and now she can't recognize even acquaintances.<br> These are glass eyes you're wearing,<br> aren't they?<br> Perfect, perfect.<br> I do hope they'll continue to attract men.<br> Oh!<br> Who is that woman?<br> The brightest new star in our social sky.<br> Introduce me. I can spend many nights studying astronomy.<br> Mrs. Crawley, permit me.<br> The Marquess of Steyne asks the honor<br> of your acquaintance.<br> Milord.<br> Will you favor me with a dance, Mrs. Crawley?<br> What a joy it is to waltz.<br> So fond of it?<br> Oh, I could die for the waltz.<br> There are some who call it an immodest dance,<br> but I've always called it the dance of the angels.<br> George, Amelia's alone on the terrace.<br> Go to her. Ask her for a dance.<br> It's a drink I need, not a dance.<br> For me, war is rising stocks.<br> I play for Napoleon's defeat. What do you play?<br> I? Patience.<br> The we are both above he fortunes of nations.<br> But not above wars.<br> Or champagne, froth, bubbles.<br> Your head swims, your heart beats.<br> Then your glass is empty.<br> And you wait for the headache.<br> Headaches can be cured.<br> Heartaches too, milord?<br> By drinking more wine. A new bottle.<br> And a new hand to pour it.<br> Oh, milord, I get drunk so easily.<br> Are we both waiting for a light in that sky,<br> madam?<br> Yes, I want this night to end.<br> I don't want the dark.<br> Heaven knows if it will end too soon.<br> If light comes before it's due.<br> Your Grace.<br> Who was that man?<br> The Duke of Wellington.<br> What's there in the distance?<br> There? A village. A small village.<br> Waterloo, or some such name.<br> And then we went on from the...<br> And it was at that point...<br> What was that?<br> Did you hear it?<br> Shhh. Listen again.<br> Cannon?<br> Thunder?<br> Artillery?<br> No, it must be a thunderstorm.<br> I say, was that a cannon?<br> Your Grace, can they shoot this far?<br> Sometimes they almost wish they could.<br> It's nothing. It must have been the wind.<br> It's just a thunderstorm.<br> I was so frightened.<br> It's a false alarm.<br> Let's dance.<br> Music! Play music!<br> It's Napoleon!<br> Get my carriage!<br> Wait for me here.<br> I'll take you home in my carriage.<br> Becky!<br> Come with me. I'll take you home.<br> We could still leave.<br> The call to the colors. Did you hear, Lieutenant?<br> The call to the colors.<br> It means nothing to me. You are coming with me.<br> I'll desert, Becky, we'll go somewhere.<br> To Canada, to Sidney.<br> Only let's hurry. There's still time.<br> Why not take your wife, George?<br> Occasionally you must remember that you're married.<br> George!<br> Oh, my dear, I've been so concerned about you.<br> You, Becky, concerned about anyone but yourself?<br> You can't take George from me.<br> By heavens!<br> You'll never take him from me.<br> You're excited, Amelia, you're frightened.<br> I don't want your George. See her home, George.<br> Take care of my poor Amy.<br> Au revoir, George.<br> I'll be watching you from above.<br> Rawdon!<br> Darling!<br> Oh, Rawdon!<br> Darling, where have you been?<br> Wellington's orders.<br> I just dashed back for a few moments.<br> Oh, darling, I have so many things to tell you<br> before I go.<br> I've been happy with you.<br> I've gambled and I drank but always...<br> always I've loved you.<br> We've loved each other, understood each other.<br> Here, take this money. I shan't need it.<br> You sell my watch, my silver dressing case.<br> Oh, darling, I leave you with so many debts.<br> No!<br> Sell my two horses.<br> Don't think about money. I'll make out.<br> I'll pray for you Rawdon. I want you back.<br> I love you!<br> I love you and I'll never love anybody else.<br> I must go now, but remember...<br> Never forget this.<br> I worship you, Becky, from your little toes up.<br> What shall I do? What will happen to me?<br> What will I do? How shall I get out of here?<br> Answer me, you little devil!<br> Answer me!<br> No horse, Sahib.<br> All join the army.<br> Now what? Now what?<br> Am I to rot away in Brussels?<br> Why did I ever leave India? Why?<br> Why?<br> Becky!<br> Not a single horse left in Brussels.<br> Is this the end of justice, Becky?<br> I could sell you a horse.<br> Becky!<br> I can sell you two horses.<br> A brown and a pink.<br> What? You're robbing!<br> Two thousand for the pair.<br> No, five hundred.<br> Do you prefer to walk?<br> You get winded so easily.<br> Seven-fifty for one horse.<br> Your proportions call for two horses.<br> Two thousand for the pair.<br> Two thousand pounds. I'm ruined.<br> Ruined. I could have bought a herd of elephants<br> for that.<br> Becky, where are those horses?<br> In the main stable. They'll recognize you.<br> The drums. The marching men.<br> In an hour they'll be dying for their country.<br> Dying for their country.<br> Well, I'm dying for my breakfast.<br> Lady Southdown, would you do me the honor.<br> Lord Liverpool, please condescend.<br> And Mrs. Sedley, would you please.<br> Your Grace... Mr. Sheridan.<br> My dear brother.<br> What honorable man is to sue for the privilege<br> of sitting on your right?<br> The loser is to challenge the winner to pistols<br> at forty paces.<br> Lord Dobbins is next to Lady Southdown<br> and you are by the famous Mrs. Sittons.<br> What would Mayfair say if that old Dane sat next to me?<br> They'd clap their hands.<br> You can't clap your hands<br> when you're whispering behind your palms.<br> Lord Steyne.<br> Bizarre. I shot a hog for the Tsar!<br> With all these famous men here,<br> I feel I'm still in the House of Lords.<br> Or lying in Westminster Abbey.<br> Why did you bring me here, Pitt?<br> This is a wicked and immoral atmosphere.<br> Look at Lord Steyne and that woman.<br> That woman is your sister-in-law now, Jane,<br> please remember.<br> And remember also that she's very pious.<br> Why, before I married you<br> she and I used to read sermons together.<br> Everything is so delightful in your new home,<br> my dear.<br> These pictures, are they family portraits?<br> Ancestors, Lady Southdown.<br> Oh, yours or Captain Crawley's?<br> Mine. The Duke and Duchess de Cordonnet.<br> Lavinia and Alastair. I bought them last week.<br> Five pounds a piece.<br> Bravo!<br> You've got them eating out of your hand.<br> But they may bite it later.<br> Becky, you've arrived.<br> Where, milord, not St. James's Palace?<br> Not yet.<br> Patience, Becky, patience.<br> The Queen presenteth Miss Elizabeth Cooper.<br> Now watch out for Mrs. Crawley.<br> She has wagered me a hundred pounds if the Prince Regent<br> will stop the presentation to talk to her.<br> It's unthinkable. The Court of St. James<br> will be shaken to its solemn foundation.<br> The foundations may be solemn, but the head isn't.<br> The Queen presenteth Mrs. Rawdon Crawley.<br> Did you get it?<br> Yes, I have, Your Grace.<br> And the man actually guarantees to take<br> ten pounds off every week.<br> The Queen presenteth Lady Cybil Clay.<br> Voil, madame.<br> Oh, exquis! Ravissant!<br> Oui, c'est sduisant, madame!<br> Very elegant, Becky!<br> Tell him I'll keep it.<br> Il ne peut pas le laisser sans avoir ru<br> quelque chose.<br> Is the man mad? Can you imagine a tradesman<br> demanding cash in this house?<br> An outrage! Shall I kick him down the stairs?<br> Be your usual gallant self and just pay the bill.<br> Voil, monsieur.<br> Twenty-five pounds?<br> Oui, monsieur.<br> I don't pay that much for my Sunday breeches.<br> Merci, monsieur.<br> Look here, Becky.<br> Everytime I come here it costs me money.<br> You either borrow or I have to pay the bill,<br> like a gentleman.<br> Why do you come?<br> To advance myself.<br> Did you or did you not promise me<br> that Lord Steyne would have me appointed to some post?<br> Well, I've spoken to him and he thinks you'd make<br> a very fine Consul...<br> at some distant spot.<br> When?<br> When? I thunder, when?<br> Promises are not enough. Am I a Consul?<br> Do I wear a sword and a cocked hat?<br> Do I stand for the British land?<br> No! Thrice no!<br> Yes! Thrice yes! It's all settled.<br> You are to be made Consul for Sierra Leone.<br> Sierra Leone?<br> Sierra Leone.<br> But, Becky. Those chaps are all cannibals.<br> How will they take to me?<br> Oh, I think they'll get to like you...<br> bit by bit.<br> Huh? But... look here, Becky.<br> At last!<br> Hello, Rawdon.<br> Where on earth have you been?<br> I've worried about you all night long.<br> I'm sorry. You shouldn't have.<br> I stayed at the club.<br> Club, eh?<br> You must have met some sirens, that's what.<br> Sirens.<br> Come now, Rawdon, confess.<br> You'll come again tomorrow, won't you?<br> Well, I'm here now, you know.<br> Wouldn't this be a good time for you to be buying<br> that cocked hat and sword?<br> That's right.<br> I'll sally forth and have me outfitted.<br> Bit by bit. Your servant, Becky.<br> Your servant, Rawdon.<br> My echo... sounds.<br> Carey & Carter thirty-seven pounds for livery.<br> And here's a little bill due for eight hundred<br> or they'll sue.<br> Bagatelle.<br> What's wrong, Rawdon?<br> Everything. I had a nasty night at the club.<br> Almost came to blows with Dussais.<br> Others had to separate us and all that sort of rot.<br> But why?<br> He kept hounding me and fretting me<br> about the four hundred pounds that I owe him.<br> He demanded immediate payment.<br> A pretty time he picked. We haven't sixpence.<br> I know, that's the devil of it.<br> After the row it became a matter<br> for the entire club.<br> Naturally a debt of honor.<br> I was instructed to pay immediately.<br> You go away for a few days<br> and the whole thing will blow over.<br> No, it won't.<br> This is not like owing money to a shopkeeper.<br> This is a gambling debt. I pay or I'm expelled.<br> Captain Dobbin is in charge of collecting it.<br> Who?<br> William Dobbin. He represents the club.<br> Dussais, that little swine. He was here last week<br> and he never even mentioned the debt.<br> He and I gambled while you played billiards.<br> Gambled? What did you play?<br> Dice. And I won.<br> For heaven's sake, you didn't...<br> The loaded dice? Oh come, come.<br> I promised you I never would. A promise is a promise.<br> I don't even know where they are.<br> I seem to have lost them.<br> Why do you look at me like that?<br> What do you see?<br> That I've become a liar, a cheat?<br> Oh, no, no.<br> But how can I help worrying, Becky?<br> Where is all this leading us?<br> Is there any end? Are we getting anywhere?<br> Who knows, who cares?<br> We live elegantly on nothing to gear.<br> Look at all the splendor.<br> It won't last.<br> We are paying heavily little bits of ourselves.<br> Well, it's worth the price.<br> Women who cut me last year would give their eyes<br> to be where I am now because they envy me.<br> This is what I've worked for. I won't give it up!<br> Don't ask me to.<br> Oh, darling, enjoy it with me.<br> But I can't get Dussais out of my mind.<br> I'll raise the money somehow.<br> I could borrow it from...<br> Steyne? You won't, not from him.<br> We have to take the money from where we can find it.<br> Not Steyne's money.<br> I won't have all London thinking that...<br> You don't really trust me, do you?<br> Is that what you wish to say?<br> Oh, no, darling.<br> I'll believe only what you tell me<br> and nothing that you deny.<br> Then believe that I'm your Becky and that I love you,<br> I love you and nothing else matters...<br> Don't worry, darling.<br> Dobbin can be persuaded to wait.<br> Mrs. Crawley, I'm a brother officer of your husband's<br> and I'm sincerely trying to help him.<br> All I can say is that the debt will have to be paid promptly,<br> it's a debt of honor.<br> But I've told you, we have no money.<br> Where do you propose I turn<br> for four hundred pounds?<br> I have no suggestions to make.<br> And I'm afraid you have to raise five hundred,<br> not four.<br> Really? A hundred pounds added for interest<br> or damages to Dussais' wounded feelings?<br> I'll try to explain as kindly as I can.<br> Mr. Dussais came to me privately.<br> He's too much the gentleman<br> to charge this before the club.<br> It seems that you played dice with him<br> some time last week and he lost a hundred pounds.<br> He did? Well, it's too hard to remember.<br> At your house. You used a pair of silver dice.<br> Loaded dice.<br> He managed to take them with him<br> after the game.<br> Unfortunately I've never seen them before.<br> Do you intend to use them?<br> I hope not.<br> Come now, aren't you rather enjoying this?<br> Here I am. You've always considered me<br> Amelia's bad angel.<br> You've always hated me. Now I'm in your power.<br> You're not in my power, I'm still trying<br> to help Rawdon.<br> Oh, of course, then this isn't a personal matter.<br> Then, if I appeal to your chivalry,<br> would you lend me the money?<br> No?<br> But perhaps you'd grant me a delay?<br> I don't think I could persuade Mr. Dussais.<br> I didn't think you would.<br> Sure, I came all prepared to do business with you.<br> I have something to sell, something I think<br> you'll be interested in buying.<br> Madam, I couldn't possibly be...<br> Wait until you see it, I've brought it with me.<br> By the way, I was brokenhearted to hear<br> that Amelia had rejected you again.<br> Mrs. Crawley!<br> Poor, darling Amelia...<br> she's still possessed with the idea<br> that she must be true to George.<br> Loyal to the dear ghost who was so true to her<br> when he was alive.<br> I have no desire to discuss...<br> Not to discuss how to gain the key<br> to her rusted little heart, Captain?<br> What noble self-denial.<br> George wrote me a letter.<br> Not a literary gem, but clear.<br> The idea was that he and I elope.<br> You remember the Duchess of Richmond's ball?<br> We were to go away that night.<br> It would be invaluable in your courtship.<br> Can you imagine the change it would bring in Amelia?<br> It's for sale. Five hundred pounds.<br> Mrs. Crawley, women like you...<br> How much time have I to pay?<br> Till tomorrow morning.<br> Oh, generous, generous.<br> You'll get the money!<br> I was just thinking. If I were Amelia would I respond<br> any more readily to your charms.<br> I walked up and down in front of the hotel.<br> And I didn't dare come in.<br> But how could I resist when I knew<br> you were in town?<br> Rebecca, you haven't told me anything.<br> What is it? What has happened? Tell me.<br> No, I can't, your kindness only makes it worse.<br> Rebecca, my dear girl, my own little sister.<br> Tell me, I have a right to know.<br> I'm the head of the family now.<br> Alas, you force me.<br> It's so humiliating to talk of money.<br> Oh, dear, perhaps you're right.<br> Your secrets are your own.<br> Yes, why should I tell you that I need<br> five hundred pounds at once or else I'll kill myself.<br> You shouldn't, you mustn't. Even if you did,<br> I couldn't afford any more money.<br> Oh, I know, I know.<br> You've always been most generous.<br> Besides, someone else has offered to help me.<br> Someone else, who?<br> Oh, a friend.<br> On second thought, you can have it, sister.<br> Brother!<br> But on a condition.<br> That you let me rescue you from<br> an unholy and imprudent connection.<br> I refer to the Marquess of Steyne.<br> Promise me that. Dear Rebecca, promise me.<br> My conscience is against it. My conscience.<br> Your conscience is kissing my hand now.<br> With my brotherly love.<br> Oh, Rebecca, do you recall<br> how we read sermons together?<br> Couldn't we read a few soon?<br> Isn't the Marquess of Steyne fortunate?<br> He has no conscience.<br> And as for brotherly love, not an ounce of it.<br> Thus each performs her part, Mamma,<br> the birds have found their voices,<br> If I'm to find five hundred pounds for you<br> we must discuss my part, hm?<br> The blowing rose a flush, Mamma,<br> her bonny cheek to dye...<br> Why do you sing, my dear?<br> It's such a prosaic matter.<br> I sing because I'm embarassed<br> and I sing because I hate to beg.<br> I'm sorry I appear to make it so difficult for you.<br> The money is at your disposal, of course.<br> What's it for this time? Pretty ribbons,<br> toast for your breakfast?<br> Or to save my name?<br> Or charity?<br> Ah, charity! There we have it.<br> I'm trying to help an unfortunate man<br> with a deserving wife.<br> Perhaps you know them. The Crawley's.<br> He got in a disagreeable mess at his club.<br> A gambling debt.<br> I'm delighted with the opportunity to serve you.<br> If I give you this money<br> will you consider the possibility of granting me<br> this evening<br> that little supper that you've promised me<br> for so long now?<br> I've been very patient, you know.<br> I am sorry, but Rawdon and I planned<br> something else for this evening.<br> Will he not be going to the club in a hurry to pay<br> that unfortunate debt?<br> Perhaps.<br> He'll have to, won't he?<br> Yes.<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> And now, go on with your singing.<br> You sing most charmingly.<br> And there's sunshine in my heart, Mamma,<br> which wakens and rejoices,<br> And so I sing and blush, Mamma,<br> and that's the reason why...<br> And so I sing and blush, Mamma,<br> No luck.<br> No? Did you try everybody?<br> Yes, everybody.<br> Come here.<br> Sit down.<br> Shut your eyes.<br> Now isn't that a wonderful surprise?<br> Wonderful.<br> Where did you get it?<br> Steyne?<br> Nonsense!<br> Lord Southdown came in this afternoon.<br> You know he owed me five hundred pounds.<br> No, I didn't. When did you discover it?<br> The moment he sent the money, silly.<br> He did? I thought he came over.<br> Well, both. He came over and...<br> he sent Fifine then with it.<br> Well, take it, darling. Be on your way with it.<br> There's no time to lose.<br> No, I suppose not.<br> Oh, darling, you've had a miserable day.<br> You need some amusement.<br> Would you like to stay at the club this evening<br> and play billiards?<br> Yes.<br> Rawdon, you're not taking the money.<br> Yes, I was going to leave the money,<br> wasn't I?<br> But you must go tonight.<br> Tonight, eh?<br> It would be quite serious if I didn't.<br> Tonight.<br> I agree with you.<br> Oh, Rawdon, it's our last debt.<br> We'll never have another...<br> once this last debt is paid.<br> It really happened?<br> It may have.<br> No sugar.<br> Thank you for remembering.<br> Ah, your little heart is flurried.<br> And my little head is in the clouds.<br> And your senses swim. Don't leave that out, Becky.<br> In a sea of happiness. I don't know what I am about.<br> I'll tell you.<br> You are about to eat a strawberry.<br> I saw you watching while I was kissing your hand.<br> Milord, you've wounded me.<br> Do you question my emotions?<br> On the contrary.<br> I am flattered that a midnight visit from the wolf<br> should prove so exciting to a lamb of your<br> coolness and self-possession.<br> I'm sorry to disappoint your Lordship,<br> but this lamb is far from being excited.<br> She thinks there's some good in every wolf.<br> Poor, optimistic lamb.<br> What was that?<br> Somebody seen in the street, or quarreling,<br> or making love.<br> Why, you don't expect an intruder, do you?<br> No, returning husbands can hardly be called intruders.<br> What a pity that yours is forced to remain away.<br> You seem confident, milord.<br> I am.<br> Curious enough, Mr. Crawley was arrested by a bailiff<br> just as he was entering his club.<br> Arrested?<br> So I have reason to believe.<br> Of course, I wasn't there to see for myself.<br> It was the most unfortunate mistake.<br> In the morning the mistake will be discovered.<br> There will be apologies and the whole thing<br> will be treated as a harmless little joke.<br> Only a joke? Then we are free to enjoy the wine.<br> And with your wit and charm,<br> how easy it will be to forget everything.<br> Not everything, Becky.<br> You mustn't forget your ambitions.<br> Ambitions?<br> I've worked like a galley slave<br> to get into your fine society.<br> And what have I got for it?<br> The privilege of dining with the dullest people in London.<br> You can't have ancestors and not be dull.<br> I'd rather be a parson's wife.<br> But you're not, Becky.<br> You've your own cock and soul in men's stockings.<br> No, nor do I replenish the earth.<br> Therefore you must enjoy life as you find it, Becky.<br> We mustn't be hypocrites, you know.<br> Otherwise, what would happen<br> to things like this little feast of ours?<br> This innocent little feast.<br> Milord, always your little generosities.<br> What beautiful pearls.<br> Didn't you hear something?<br> You heard your own wicked little heart.<br> No, no!<br> How did you do it, Becky?<br> How the devil did you ever catch my fancy<br> because there isn't an ounce of sweetness<br> or goodness about you.<br> That's your secret.<br> Wait, wait, we must drink to that.<br> To your marvelous portrait of me.<br> To your shrewd understanding.<br> Here's to...<br> Rawdon. Milord and I are having...<br> Milord and I...<br> You didn't go to the club.<br> When you left the house you didn't go to the club.<br> A trap, hmm?<br> Mrs. Crawley's husband returns to his home unexpectedly.<br> He doesn't go to his club.<br> Well, sir, how much am I blackmailed for?<br> I've done nothing, I'm innocent.<br> Milord, tell him I'm innocent.<br> Innocent?<br> Come off with the amount.<br> I've already paid five hundred...<br> for your absence.<br> No, no, Rawdon!<br> I'll make you pay for this.<br> You'll regret this to the end of your life.<br> Why bother?<br> Why squabble about something that you don't own...<br> and I don't want.<br> Rawdon, listen to me.<br> If I've ever done anything...<br> Those pearls, take them off.<br> I'll explain, I have nothing to hide.<br> All the world might have been here...<br> Don't hate me!<br> Oh, let them go, I don't want them.<br> It's only you I want.<br> I love you, I love you...<br> I won't let you go! I'll fight for you!<br> I couldn't have done anything else.<br> I had to help, I had to do something for you,<br> for both of us.<br> Don't hate me, try to understand.<br> All right, darling, I'm yours.<br> Nothing else matters.<br> My love for you is the only real thing<br> that I have in my life.<br> Don't take that away from me!<br> Don't leave me!<br> You can't leave me, I'm your wife!<br> You're not my wife!<br> Just someone I was once married to.<br> But that's over with!<br> Rawdon!<br> Oh, Rawdon!<br> They'll all laugh at me!<br> Oh, how they'll laugh!<br> Oh, I love Windy!<br> Oh, I love Nelly.<br> Up, Windy! Up, Windy!<br> Capital! Capital!<br> I had no idea I'd fancy this.<br> The seamy side of life, me boy.<br> The seamy side, eh?<br> We've been watching the seams.<br> Young Molly who lives at the foot of the hill<br> whose fame every maiden with envy doth fill.<br> Why, Myers, that's Mrs. Crawley! Becky!<br> She's been out of England.<br> She's either come back or I'm seeing things.<br> Hey, that's my fear you're singing to.<br> Here, here, don't annoy her ladyship.<br> They call her the lass with the delicate air.<br> I say, I'm delicate. See how delicate I am.<br> Then tell me ye swains who have conquered<br> the fair<br> How to win the dear lass with the delicate air<br> Delicate! That was my trouble.<br> How to win the dear lass...<br> with the delicate air.<br> How to win the dear lass with the...<br> delicate air.<br> ...with the delicate air<br> Out! Out with you!<br> You impostor!<br> You fraud! You've disgraced my house!<br> The finest place in Bath.<br> A pigsty, run by a hog for swine.<br> And what are you?<br> A lady!<br> Forthright, dearie, read the cards.<br> Ask them where to find the money<br> for the landlord.<br> 'Cause you pay today, or out you go.<br> Tell him I'll settle tomorrow.<br> Do you think he'll believe that?<br> He knows all about what happened<br> to the great singer last night.<br> I'm expecting a remittance any day now.<br> I've written to my brother who's a rich man,<br> a baronet.<br> Your brother, eh?<br> I used to call them me cousins.<br> I had an earl and a count.<br> You wouldn't think it, would you,<br> looking at me now.<br> But I was a dancer.<br> I had me home in Park Lane.<br> Me jewels, me carriages.<br> Now I got me broom and me scrubbing brush.<br> There won't be any brush for me nor broom,<br> you old crow.<br> It's not in the cards.<br> The king of hearts... Rawdon...<br> See how close we are to each other?<br> There's the king of spades between them.<br> The king of spades. He always keeps us apart.<br> Well, you can forget about it if you drink<br> enough brandy.<br> Superstition, nonsense.<br> I'm not the queen of hearts and Rawdon's<br> not the king.<br> Who cares? Cards won't bring him back, anyway.<br> Then why do you sit here wishing and sighing?<br> Because I dream and I don't want to dream.<br> I don't want to see him shipwrecked, killed,<br> dying of fever.<br> The ace of spades.<br> Do you think he's dead?<br> Cards never lie.<br> Now what the devil?<br> Perhaps we're not welcome.<br> Here!<br> Mrs. Crawley.<br> Becky!<br> Come in!<br> Becky! What a time I had finding you.<br> What happened to you after the theater last night?<br> Did you fly off in a balloon?<br> Becky, you mustn't look away.<br> Amy, how can I face you here, looking like this?<br> Ah!<br> Joseph, my gentle friend.<br> Now, that's better.<br> Thought you were going to throw me out.<br> That brush in my stomach wasn't very cordial.<br> Amy, what are you doing here?<br> Why did you come?<br> Nothing could have kept me away.<br> When Joseph came home and said<br> that he'd seen you...<br> I said, "Amy, I've just seen Becky cutting capers."<br> She said, "You didn't",<br> I said, "I did, capers."<br> We'd have gone on arguing for hours,<br> but Dobbin arrived with a pineapple.<br> Dobbin? Is he with you?<br> Are you married to him?<br> Oh, no, he just happened to accompany us.<br> He's been happening for years.<br> What I mean to say is, accompanying Amy.<br> At this very moment he's down in the caproom<br> accompanying a mug of beer.<br> He wouldn't come up, he still remembers.<br> Don't, Becky, the past must be forgotten.<br> Not there, dear, it's such a mess!<br> I've been too sick, too dejected<br> to put things in order.<br> It doesn't matter, dear.<br> We always used to fit on the bed for our talks.<br> Come sit by me.<br> Amelia.<br> Becky...<br> I still have your little bed from my house.<br> How would you like to have it again<br> for your very own?<br> I offer it to you with all the old affection.<br> Amelia!<br> You can't stay here. Come live with me.<br> Oh, this is a dream.<br> Dream, eh? Well, it isn't.<br> Leave us, Jos.<br> Go down to Dobbin in the caproom.<br> Becky and I have much to say that's not<br> for strange ears.<br> My ears are strange? They're the same ones<br> I've worn for forty years.<br> Did you mean what you said?<br> Do you know what you're doing for me?<br> You're saving me from myself, from this.<br> from Pitt, with his leering charity<br> and his clammy hands.<br> I've written him a letter, pleading for money.<br> You have no need of him now.<br> No, I can go with you.<br> Oh, for the first time in years I'm happy again.<br> I can breathe. You've done this for me.<br> You, Amy, you.<br> You've been like a sister to me, always.<br> Come in.<br> You decided to come up, after all.<br> Amelia! Joseph has just told me<br> that you've asked Mrs. Crawley to...<br> Oh, I knew it. It was too good to last.<br> That you've asked her to come and live with you.<br> He told you the truth, William.<br> Becky is the oldest friend I have in the world.<br> She wasn't always a friend to you.<br> I don't care to remember that.<br> Isn't there such a thing as forgiveness?<br> Forgive her if you will, help her, give her money,<br> but don't take her with you.<br> She needs me.<br> She's hard, she's selfish, she'll take advantage of you.<br> As your friend I can't let you do this.<br> Promise me you won't.<br> I've given you the devotion of a lifetime.<br> This is the only favor I've ever asked of you.<br> If you deny me,<br> this will mean the end of our friendship.<br> I must do what's right.<br> Then, goodbye.<br> William!<br> You're in love with the man.<br> You can't live without him.<br> It would break your heart to lose him.<br> Amy, I'm not coming home with you.<br> I'll not let you do this.<br> I'll send you back to Dobbin...<br> no matter how much he's hated me.<br> Don't give up, love.<br> Don't let it be taken from you by me or anybody else.<br> Fight for it, keep it. It doesn't come often.<br> But you...<br> Don't worry about me. I'll manage.<br> Go downstairs, he'll be waiting for you.<br> Take his hand. Ask him to marry you.<br> I can't. I'll never marry him.<br> You will, why shouldn't you?<br> Because of George.<br> I must be true to his memory, to his love.<br> Love, why you fool, you monkey,<br> he never really loved you.<br> He did!<br> I'll prove it to you.<br> No matter what you say, I think he did.<br> He was never faithful to you.<br> He made love to me when you were hardly married.<br> Your husband in heaven... Here it is.<br> You know the handwriting. He wrote this to me.<br> Sent it to me in Brussels right under<br> your unsuspecting little nose.<br> Now you know. Now you're free<br> to forget the past.<br> Go to the man who really loves you.<br> Marry him!<br> Go on, go on!<br> I say, Amy, did you and Dobbin have a breeze?<br> Jos, you're drunk.<br> Drunk? I, drunk?<br> This is an unjustice.<br> Am I her only brother?<br> Similarly, is she my only sister?<br> Similarly, where is she running to?<br> To Dobbin. She's going to marry him.<br> What?<br> Why, I... think that's beautiful.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What have you lost?<br> Lost my heart out of my bosom.<br> To see my sister blessed with such happiness.<br> Why weep? They'll be happy but they haven't stolen<br> all the happiness in the world.<br> I think they have.<br> Would you like to sit down and be<br> just as happy as they are?<br> Yes.<br> Do you like brandy, Joseph?<br> How will it sit with the beer in me?<br> Perfect! Extra fine cognac.<br> And we have biscuits and golden doughnuts.<br> We'll have a feast.<br> Do you mind sharing the plate with me?<br> No. Quite the contrary.<br> I'll even share the bottle.<br> I have only one knife, I'm ashamed to admit.<br> Isn't it enchanting?<br> Enchanting? You're enchanting too.<br> Drink hearty, drink deep.<br> A million years have passed since we drank together.<br> Or sat together undisturbed.<br> Returning glance for glance, smile for smile.<br> Golden doughnut for golden doughnut.<br> To the happy two people.<br> To the memory of the past.<br> And the joy of the present.<br> When two people meet again and they agree.<br> That's it!<br> Agree!<br> Honors to our sentiments, Becky!<br> Think of a a little cottage with the trees,<br> the stars above...<br> Honors to the stars above!<br> And the murmuring of moonlit streams<br> and the perfume of love...<br> Does that fetch you, you dear, gay fellow?<br> It's you that are gay, Becky.<br> Gay and... gallant.<br> Come, come closer, Becky.<br> Jos, you frighten me. You're so intense.<br> Intense, but honorable, Becky.<br> Tell me, are you a widow?<br> Yes, or no, because you must become...<br> my widow next.<br> Later, later we'll talk about it.<br> Now you must help me pack.<br> I've had enough of all this. We're going!<br> Going? Where?<br> Mayfair, India, anywhere! Away from all this.<br> We can't, Becky, I have no money.<br> No money? You're poor?<br> Who dares accuse Joseph "Waterloo" Sedley of poverty?<br> No, it's just that I have no cash.<br> We'll have to wait here for a week<br> until my next month's allowance comes.<br> But I can't wait.<br> The landlord will have me jailed by then.<br> Speak of the devil.<br> Who's there?<br> It's I, Rebecca. And Jane.<br> They're here. My letter, they've come.<br> What shall I do?<br> Let me throw them out.<br> Wait! Perhaps they are a blessing in disguise.<br> Becky! Sister!<br> Brother!<br> The money we need. I'll get it from Pitt.<br> Oh, darling James. I can't believe it's really you.<br> One moment. I must make myself presentable.<br> Climb out the window.<br> If Pitt finds you here,<br> I'll never get the money from him.<br> Climb out!<br> I can't. The cheers have gone to my head.<br> I'm almost ready, quite ready.<br> Here... hurry!<br> Oh, this bliss, this happiness!<br> Oh, Jane.<br> My Jane.<br> My forgiving kinsman, to see you again.<br> To feel my hand in yours after such a long time.<br> Your letter came, Rebecca.<br> Our hearts we were deeply touched by your plight.<br> My prayers have been answered.<br> Yes, we've come to rescue you.<br> To restore you to the bosom of our family,<br> to the tranquility of Queen's Crawley.<br> Queen's Crawley? Oh, I'm overcome.<br> Before we do that, my dear,<br> you must cleanse your soul.<br> Rebecca, would it not make you happy<br> to go to church with us?<br> Before we talk of anything else?<br> Oh, I'd go happily, happily.<br> As soon as I settle with the landlord.<br> He'll not let me leave the house<br> until I pay him the money I owe him.<br> Isn't the peace of your soul more urgent?<br> Yes, but so is the landlord urgent.<br> I trust it's not a large amount.<br> No. Two hundred pounds.<br> Settle with him for thirty-five.<br> One hundred and fifty?<br> Fifty then.<br> Make it a hundred, brother.<br> Then we can go and listen to the sermon.<br> Thank you.<br> What was that? Aren't you alone?<br> Alone, always alone. It must have been a mouse.<br> Now, dear, get your wallet and come.<br> To regain peace.<br> Yes, regain... peace...<br> Oh... Peace... regain...<br> Oh, what's wrong? Oh, dear.<br> My heart. The excitement of seeing you again.<br> Water.<br> Oh, no, perhaps I'll feel better soon if I rest.<br> Yes, rest. And I shall stay with you<br> and care for you in your need.<br> Oh, no, you mustn't. I'd never forgive myself<br> if you missed the service.<br> You must go, dear. I'm used to my solitude.<br> Please go and come back for me later.<br> Come, dear, Rebecca is overwrought.<br> Soon as she rests she will be better.<br> This book of moral precepts that we brought you...<br> When you're better, read and profit.<br> The title is "Rewards of Virtue."<br> Until later then, poor child.<br> Rest well.<br> One hundred pounds. And I owe the landlord twelve.<br> Don't stand there blinking at me.<br> You must get out of here.<br> I'm not blinking. That's love.<br> The trunk's for our love.<br> Put those letters in then lock it.<br> We're going. Going.<br> India. Rich places. Taxes to collect.<br> Butterflies and elephants.<br> Fine Rajahs in rubies and gold.<br> The box! The box!<br> Pitt! Brother!<br> Yes, Rebecca?<br> My deepest gratitude, brother,<br> for virtue is its own reward!<br>
