Mariquita!<br> Hazle comer|el mojn de caballo!<br> ( gunshots )<br> Coo! Qu es eso?<br> Qu pasa ahora?<br> Oye, welcome to our picnic,|compaero.<br> Tranquilo,|no te muevas de all.<br> - What do you want?|- Shut up.<br> What do I want?<br> I want Carlos first|to frisk this guy.<br> Why him?<br> See if he's got a weapon.<br> He's not even dressed.<br> What's your name?<br> My name?<br> Franz Kafka.<br> Franz Kafka.<br> You're funny.<br> You think I'm ignorant?<br> Let's see how|ignorant you are.<br> Ever heard of a summer camp|called La Isla de la Juventud?<br> No, then maybe|you can tell me...<br> when was the last time|you took it up your ass?<br> The last time?<br> Oh, I don't remember.<br> You don't remember?<br> But, I remember|the last time you did.<br> When was that?<br> Maybe the last time|you bent over<br> to tie your boots?<br> Est bien,|lo ves, no?<br> Est bien, est bien.<br> Do you have a cigarette?<br> Yes, I have a cigarette.<br> There was also a sexual|revolution going on<br> that came along with excitement|of the official revolution--<br> but the drums of militarism|were still trying to beat down<br> the rhythm of poetry and life.<br> When I wasn't at my job|at the library,<br> or guard duty,|or attending rallies,<br> there were three|wonderful things<br> that I enjoyed|in the 60's:<br> my typewriter, at which I sat|like a dedicated performer<br> sitting at his piano;<br> the youth of those days,<br> when everyone was ready|to break free;<br> and lastly, the full discovery|of the sea.<br> Did you ever notice there|are four categories of gays?<br> Really?<br> Really.<br> Which are they?<br> Well, the first one|is the dog collar gay--<br> He's loud,<br> shows off that|he's gay,<br> there's no limit|to his sexual voracity,<br> therefore he's constantly|being arrested.<br> The system has created|a permanent collar<br> around his neck,<br> so they can|hook him up<br> and take him to|a rehabilitation camp<br> like a Valparaso.<br> Two is the common gay.<br> He's made his commitments|with other gays,<br> has a job, film clubs,<br> likes to sip tea|with his friends,<br> writes a poem|now and then,<br> only has relations|with other gays,<br> never takes a risk,<br> and never gets|to know a real man.<br> The third one,<br> the closet gay,|okay,<br> nobody knows|he is gay.<br> He's married,|has children,<br> hides on his way|to the bathroom,<br> still wearing the ring|that his wife gave him.<br> They're hard to spot,|but I've got one here.<br> Most of the time they're|the ones who censor other gays.<br> And fourth, the royal gay,<br> a unique product|of our country,<br> a communist country.<br> Because of his closeness|to our Maximum Leader<br> or special work with|the State Security,<br> he can afford|to be openly gay,<br> travel freely in this|country and abroad,<br> cover himself|with jewels, clothes...<br> Coo, he even has|a private chauffeur.<br> Hey, hey.|Stop!<br> Reinaldo!<br> Hey, Reinaldo!<br> Come on.|We'll give you a ride.<br> Where are you going?<br> Don't worry.|Take a seat.<br> Hello.<br> How are you?<br> Now, we're going to take|a little shortcut<br> and show you a beautiful|part of Havana<br> that not many|visitors get to see.<br> The crackdown began in earnest.<br> The horror and ugliness|advanced day by day<br> at an ever increasing pace,<br> but the oppression only|acted as a stimulus<br> and sex became a way|of fighting it...<br> a weapon to use|against the regimen.<br> Needless to say,<br> the Revolution wasn't|for everybody.<br> Mr. Heberto Zorrilla Ochoa,<br> are you aware of Article 243|in the Penal Code?<br> Yes.<br> And

they were there.<br> Are you aware|that Lezama Lima<br> and Virgilio Piera|are homosexuals?<br> Yes.<br> I am aware of my errors.<br> that are unpardonable,<br> errors that demand|to be severely punished.<br> But I must confess|that I see before me<br> in this room,<br> the faces of many comrades|who like me,<br> have lost their way,<br> whose ideology has waivered,<br> who have committed|similar errors...<br> errors that also demand|to be severely punished.<br> ( crowd screams )<br> I'm sorry.|I'm late.<br> We got a call about|an hour ago.<br> They said they would be|at the Hotel Nacional<br> and they're leaving|today at 4:00 p.m.<br> That's all they said?<br> They're friends of|Lezama Lima.<br> - Reinaldo?|- Yes.<br> I'm Jorge Camacho.<br> - This is my wife,
