Or boyfriends?<br> Makes it very easy<br> to end up alone.<br> To leave people.<br> You can stay in the same place and<br> still find ways to leave people.<br> You are like that?<br> It's what you do?<br> So, we are the same?<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> Oh, did I wake you?<br> Yeah. Thank you, Maria.<br> And now that you're here,<br> would you please<br> put those up there?<br> What are you...

Yeah?<br> Yeah.<br> Right.<br> - Here, Pop.<br> - Oh, God.<br> I know, I know.<br> Come on.<br> Hey, no, no, no. That's Gay<br> Pride day stuff. Just leave those.<br> All right.<br> And that's gay book club.<br> You better leave those, too.<br> But what about the chair?<br> Is the chair gay?<br> The chair is not gay.<br> Obviously.<br> Pop, Pop, the cord<br> won't go so far.<br> To hell with it.<br> Oh, what's that?<br> Now that you're<br> out of the hospital,<br> you'll have to exercise,<br> get you back into shape.<br> That's a great idea.<br> Okay, let's try it.<br> I'll show you how.<br> Yeah, later on.<br> I'm gonna make<br> myself some tea.<br> Okay. I'll go clean it up.<br> It's a little bit...<br> Your mother's vase<br> needs some flowers.<br> You need to tell Andy<br> that you're not well.<br> Pop, you're just out of the<br> hospital. You should take it easy.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> You'll tell him,<br> won't you?<br> Me?<br> Please.<br> Hey.<br> You know, I tried to<br> have sex with women?<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> I just wanted you to know, I<br> tried. It just... It didn't work.<br> Hey, I don't have<br> a problem with gay guys.<br> Have you had<br> sex with a man?<br> No.<br> I heard that if a man hasn't<br> had sex with another man,<br> he's always<br> afraid of gay men.<br> You know,<br> they're a threat.<br> I don't know, Andy.<br> I didn't want you<br> to feel threatened.<br> I don't wanna<br> have sex with you.<br> What I do,<br> most people wouldn't<br> even call it sex anyway.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Hey.<br> I couldn't tell him.<br> That's okay.<br> No, it's not.<br> You can't hide this<br> from him. He loves you.<br> For someone with so much<br> relationship advice,<br> you seem awfully alone.<br> Just act natural.<br> When he's not looking,<br> we'll make a run for it.<br> Okay?<br> Don't, don't, don't.<br> It's my dad.<br> He's that bad?<br> I'm gonna<br> let you be me.<br> Okay.<br> Annie?<br> You never call me back.<br> I'm busy. I'm shooting all the time.<br> You know, I can't<br> stop thinking about...<br> You know, about it.<br> Doing it.<br> Doing what?<br> Killing myself.<br> You are the only one<br> I can tell that to.<br> You should tell Mom<br> about that, not me.<br> You are my girl.<br> Now I'll have<br> to kill you.<br> Just as it was<br> going so well.<br> I know. I'm sorry.<br> Really?<br> Hey, Anna.<br> Hey, Oliver.<br> How do you feel<br> about vandalism?<br> I don't know.<br> Pretty okay.<br> Oliver,<br> don't write any of that serious<br> stuff, okay? Just something funny.<br> Girls like funny.<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> You know what?<br> Here, give me Arthur.<br> We'll just stay here<br> and get arrested.<br> You know, that's good.<br> - Good?<br> - Mmm.<br> You okay?<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> You okay?<br> Yeah. I'm gonna stay<br> here with my new friend.<br> Okay.<br> Anna?<br> I'm trying<br> to impress you.<br> Really?<br> It's working.<br> Arthur, Arthur.<br> No, no, no, no.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No problem. No problem.<br> What's with this card?<br> - Do you mind?<br> - No.<br> - Thank you.<br> - All right.<br> He looked like your dad.<br> Yeah.<br> Somewhere along the line<br> he stopped admitting to<br> himself that he was sick.<br> Oliver, this is Blake.<br> He's a wonderful man.<br> Look.

I can't leave him in the car.<br> I'm sorry, no.<br> He needs to be removed.<br> I don't know what she's<br> saying and I don't like it.<br> You need to remove the dog<br> from the premises.<br> She's just talking in French. She's<br> saying, "It's okay, it's such a small dog."<br> - You're gonna call the authorities?<br> - All right, you know what?<br> - She's calling the authorities.<br> - Steal the skates.<br> Steal the skates.<br> - Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> - Come on, Arthur.<br> - Faster, faster.<br> Okay.

Why?<br> Because I'm falling<br> in love with you.<br> Anna and I are<br> in a relationship in 2003.<br> This is what<br> the sun looks like<br> and the stars.<br> This is what it looks like when we eat.<br> When we tell each other<br> the stories in our heads.<br> I was born in 1965.<br> Anna was born in 1971.<br> This is what<br> the sun looked like.<br> Her pets.<br> Her parents.<br> She left home<br> when she was sixteen.<br> She lived here and here<br> and here and here.<br> She had three serious relationships.<br> She left all of them.<br> I had four serious relationships.<br> I left them, too.<br> Or let them fall apart.<br> We didn't go to this war.<br> We didn't have to<br> hide to have sex.<br> Our good fortune<br> allowed us to feel<br> a sadness that our parents<br> didn't have time for,<br> and a happiness that<br> I never saw with them.<br> We didn't know how we learned<br> the stories in our heads,<br> but sometimes<br> they stop running<br> and I can really see<br> Anna's eyes in 2003.<br> Her ears.<br> Her feet.<br> This is what it looks like when she says,<br> "I love you," in 2003.<br> This is what it looks<br> like when she cries.<br> When she tells me there's<br> always a new empty room waiting for her.<br> They used to<br> make her feel free.<br> Now they make her feel<br> the opposite of free.<br> - Last one.<br> - Oh, Lord.<br> I know.<br> There.<br> This is for you. Yeah.<br> Now, that means<br> Gay Pride.<br> Yeah, everyone<br> knows that.<br> No, they don't.<br> Yeah. Everyone<br> knows about that.<br> No. Of course not.<br> Don't be silly.<br> Pop, pretty much everyone<br> knows that that means Gay Pride.<br> - Do they really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Did you know?<br> About me?<br> No.<br> I just thought you<br> and Mom weren't in love.<br> We loved each other.<br> But you were gay<br> the whole time.<br> Well, I worked<br> hard not to be.<br> For 44 years?<br> Yeah.<br> I knew I was gay, though.<br> I mean, at parties I'd be staring<br> at the husbands and not the wives.<br> What about sex?<br> Well, she didn't think<br> I was the greatest lover.<br> But we made do.<br> Look, I liked my life.<br> The museum, our house.<br> That's what I wanted.<br> And Mom.<br> You wanted Mom,<br> too, right?<br> Yes!<br> Stop that.<br> She proposed to me,<br> you know.<br> I said,<br> "Look, I love you, and we're great<br> buddies, but you know what I am."<br> And then she says,<br> "That doesn't matter.<br> "I'll fix that."<br> I thought,<br> "Oh, God.<br> "I'll try anything."<br> Sex.<br> Life.<br> Healing.<br> Sunlight.<br> Nature.<br> Magic.<br> Serenity.<br> Spirit.<br> The first Gay Pride flag was made by<br> a man named Gilbert Baker in 1978.<br> He gave a meaning<br> to each color.<br> This man was President.<br> This was invented.<br> This is what<br> movies looked like.<br> Pets.<br> On November 27th, 1978,<br> Harvey Milk was shot and killed.<br> One week after, my father<br> opened his annual museum Christmas exhibit.<br> He collected stuffed animals<br> from people in the community<br> and he put them on display.<br> My father printed a quote<br> from The Velveteen Rabbit<br> in large type on the wall.<br> The stuffed rabbit asked,<br> "What is real?"<br> And the rabbit asked,<br> "Does it hurt?"<br> And the horse said,<br> "Sometimes."<br> "Does it happen all at once?"<br> "It takes a long time.<br> "Generally,<br> by the time you are real,<br> "most of your hair<br> has been loved off,<br> "your eyes dropped out,<br> and you get loose in the joints.<br> "But these things<br> don't matter at all<br> "because you are real.<br> "You can't be ugly except to people<br> who don't understand. "<br> Andy's moving in.<br> Yeah?<br> Is that a good idea?<br> Just be happy<br> about it. Huh?<br> Come on.<br> This is the idea, is<br> that it's the history of sadness.<br> Here could be your...<br> This could be your...<br> You know, you're<br> gonna need a big CD box.<br> Four billion years ago,<br> Earth begins.<br> And the idea is that sadness<br> has not yet been created, but...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, too.<br> Well, that went well.<br> Come on, Arthur.<br> This is the living room.<br> Dining room.<br> There are my... I have some<br> boxes. They're my parents.<br> My mom.<br> Hal, Georgia, meet Anna.<br> Anna, Hal, Georgia.<br> Hi.<br> - These are the stairs.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> They go up.<br> I emptied these for you.<br> I'll get your case.<br> Are you okay?<br> I couldn't sleep and I<br> didn't want to bother you.<br> I was...<br> I was nervous<br> and excited.<br> I kept thinking, maybe,<br> I'm not so lost.<br> Why were you<br> crying yesterday?<br> You okay?<br> Yeah.<br> You look so unhappy.<br> Well, are you happy?<br> Here?<br> Maybe I'm not<br> perfect at it.<br> I don't really know<br> what I'm doing.<br> But I wanna be here.<br> I don't know, Anna.<br> I don't think this is what<br> I'm supposed to feel like.<br> Okay.<br> I will go back<br> to New York then.<br> Hal, you don't need to come in<br> for any more treatments.<br> Is there something wrong?<br> It's best<br> you stay home.<br> Hospice can<br> help you more now.<br> Any more treatments<br> would just<br> cause more pain.<br> Yeah, I understand.<br> I'm sorry. I wish<br> we could do more.<br> No, no, you've, you've done<br> an excellent job, Dr. Long.<br> And thank you<br> for coming to the party.<br> You always wanted to hold my hand<br> when you were little.<br> I couldn't, you know. I was<br> afraid it would look funny.<br> I wanted to be<br> close, you know,<br> and my father certainly<br> was never close with me.<br> God, I hope<br> I wasn't like that.<br> I can barely remember you<br> from when I was little.<br> I guess I was at work.<br> Look at the hand<br> of the man in the brushwork.<br> It's as if you can feel the spirit<br> of the artist, if he's very good.<br> And his every gesture.<br> It's like a sort of<br> structural entity in...<br> I mean that in the...<br> Let's go home.<br> ...largest use<br> of that word.<br> What about your father? What<br> will he possibly do without us?<br> Georgia,<br> are you leaving?<br> Yes, Mary.<br> It's an emergency.<br> Oliver's appendix<br> has ruptured.<br> Oh, dear.<br> He's a very composed child.<br> You point,<br> I'll drive.<br> Ah!

But I didn't leave.<br> Fuck. I'm in<br> your building.<br> Okay. See the window<br> near to the radiator?<br> There is<br> a hide-a-key behind it.<br> Okay, I'm inside.<br> Well, there's,<br> like, nothing here.<br> No.<br> This is my kitchen.<br> It's where I eat.<br> This is my bathroom.<br> It's very fancy.<br> Outside my window<br> is my neighbor's roof.<br> The room at the end<br> is my bedroom.<br> That's my closet.<br> Those are my clothes.<br> My pictures.<br> Why do you leave everyone?<br> Why did you let me go?<br> Maybe because<br> I don't really believe that it's gonna work.<br> And then I make sure<br> that it doesn't work.<br> Isn't Juan's hair<br> wonderful?<br> Thanks.<br> I use this<br> great mousse.<br> Well, it's terrific.<br> Do you wanna<br> try something?<br> Just a little bit?<br> I don't think so.<br> Come on.
