                        Craig, honey, it's time for bed.<br> Craig, honey, time to get up.<br> Craig, honey, time to get up.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't know Orrin Hatch<br> was out of his cage.<br> - Come here. Morning, sweetheart.<br> - Morning.<br> What are you gonna do today, honey?<br> Working in the workshop.<br> I was thinking, maybe you'd feel better<br> if you got a job.<br> We've been over this.<br> Nobody's looking for a puppeteer<br> in today's wintry economic climate.<br> I know, honey, but I thought, you know...<br> ...maybe something else<br> until this puppet thing turns around.<br> Derek Mantini doesn't need a day job.<br> Not everybody can be Derek Mantini.<br> I gotta get to the shop. We have<br> a shipment of kitty litter coming in.<br> Will you do me a favor?<br> Will you take a look at Elijah today?<br> - He's not feeling very good again.<br> - Which one is Elijah again?<br> - The chimp, honey.<br> - Yeah, okay.<br> On the lighter side of the news<br> in Westchester County today...<br> ... puppeteer Derek Mantini<br> thrilled onlookers as he performed...<br> ...The Belle of Amherst<br> with a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet.<br> "How dreary to be somebody!"<br> "How public, like a frog<br> To tell your name the livelong day"<br> Gimmicky bastard.<br> You don't know how lucky you are,<br> being a monkey.<br> Because consciousness...<br> ...is a terrible curse.<br> I think, I feel, I suffer.<br> And all I ask in return<br> is the opportunity to do my work.<br> And they won't allow it...<br> ...because I raise issues.<br> While we enjoyed the pleasures<br> of an uneasy love...<br> ... and abandoned ourselves to fornication...<br> ... we were spared God's severity.<br> Say no more, I beg you,<br> and cease from complaints like these...<br> ... which are so far-removed<br> from the true depths of love.<br> Look, a puppet show!<br> Okay, honey, just for a minute.<br> Mommy's waiting.<br> Even during the celebration of Mass<br> when our prayers should be pure...<br> ... lewd visions of these pleasures<br> take such a hold upon my unhappy soul...<br> ... that my thoughts are<br> on their very wantonness...<br> ... instead of my prayers.<br> Sometimes my thoughts are betrayed...<br> ... by the movement of my body.<br> I took my fill<br> of my wretched pleasures in you...<br> ... and this was the sum total of my love.<br> You motherfucker!<br> Oh, Craig!<br> Honey, not again!<br> Why do you do this to yourself, honey?<br> I'm a puppeteer.<br> Seven and a half, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I'll take you through it.<br> Seven and a half.<br> Thank you.<br> Welcome to Lestercorp.<br> How may we meet your filing needs?<br> No. My name's Craig Schwartz.<br> I have an interview with Dr. Lester.<br> - Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez.<br> - Schwartz.<br> - Pardon?<br> - Schwartz.<br> I'm sorry, I have no idea<br> what you're saying to me right now.<br> - My name is Schwartz.<br> - "My name is Warts."<br> Mr. Juarez?<br> Yes?<br> - Chest?<br> - I said, "Yes".<br> You suggest what?<br> I'm sorry. I have no time for piddling<br> suggestions from mumbling job applicants.<br> Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now.<br> Come in, Mr. Juarez.<br> My name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.<br> Security!<br> No, sir, it's just a little mix-up<br> with your secretary.<br> My name is Craig Schwartz.<br> I tried to explain that to her.<br> She's not my secretary.<br> She's what they call an executive liaison.<br> And I am not banging her,<br> if that's what you're implying.<br> No, sir, not at all.<br> I think I must have simply misspoke.<br> Well, now, tell me, Dr. Schwartz...<br> ...what do you feel<br> you can bring to Lestercorp?<br> Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.<br> Are you? All right. Let's see about that.<br> Which of these two letters comes first?<br> This one or this one?<br> The symbol on the left is not a letter, sir.<br> Damn, you're good.<br> - I was trying to trick you.<br> - I see.<br> - Well then, put these in order.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Floris, get Guinness on the phone.<br> Yes, sir. Genghis Khan Capone. Fine.<br> Damn fine woman, Floris.<br> I don't know how she puts up<br> with this speech impediment of mine.<br> You don't have a speech impediment,<br> Dr. Lester.<br> Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy.<br> I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on that one.<br> You see, she's got her doctorate...<br> ...in Speech Impedimentology<br> from Case Western.<br> I apologize if you can't understand<br> a word I'm saying.<br> No, I understand perfectly.<br> It's very kind of you to lie.<br> You see, I've been very Ionely...<br> ...in my isolated tower<br> of indecipherable speech.<br> You got the job.<br> - Any questions?<br> - Well, just one.<br> Why are these ceilings so low?<br> Low overhead, my boy!<br> We pass the savings on to you.<br> But seriously, that'll all be covered<br> in orientation.<br> Welcome to the 7 1/2 floor<br> of the Mertin-Flemmer building.<br> As you'll now be spending<br> your workday here...<br> ... it's important that you learn a bit<br> about the history of this famous floor.<br> - Hello, Don.<br> - Hello, Wendy.<br> Don, I was wondering, do you know why...<br> ... our workplace has such low ceilings?<br> It's an interesting story.<br> Many years ago in the late 1800s...<br> ... James Mertin, an Irish ship captain,<br> came to this town...<br> ... and decided to erect an office building.<br> He called this building the Mertin-Flemmer<br> building after himself and...<br> ... someone else, who local legend<br> has it was named Flemmer.<br> Well, one day, old Captain Mertin received<br> an unexpected visitor.<br> - Captain Mertin?<br> - Aye. What want ye, girl child?<br> I'm not a child, but rather an adult lady<br> of miniature proportions.<br> I see. Well, if it's charity you're after...<br> ... be gone with ye, you foul demon!<br> I'm not asking for alms, Captain...<br> ... but, rather, the ear of a kind man<br> with a noble heart.<br> Well, speak then, if you must.<br> Captain Mertin, I'm afraid that the world<br> was not built with me in mind.<br> Doorknobs are too high,<br> chairs are unwieldy...<br> ... and high-ceilinged rooms<br> mock my stature.<br> Why cannot there be a place for me<br> to work that's safe and comfortable?<br> Thy story has moved me like no other.<br> Therefore, I shall make ye me wife.<br> And I shall build a floor for ye...<br> ... between the seventh and the eighth<br> in me own building...<br> ... so at least there'll be one place<br> on God's green earth...<br> ... where ye and your accursed kind<br> can live in peace.<br> So that's the story of 7 1/2.<br> Since the rents are considerably lower,<br> this floor has been adopted...<br> ... by businesses which have been forced<br> to cut corners.<br> After all, the overhead is low.<br> Moving story, huh?<br> Unfortunately, the story's bullshit.<br> Listen, I'm Craig Schwartz.<br> I'm just starting out at Lestercorp.<br> Where are you starting out?<br> Shut up! Shut up!<br> - Shut up! Shut up!<br> - Hey, shut up!<br> - Shut up!<br> - I'm sorry, honey.<br> Sorry, honey.<br> Sorry, honey.<br> - Shut up!<br> - Sorry!<br> - Help! She's locking me in a cage.<br> - Isn't that cute?<br> - I just taught him that today.<br> - Yeah, that's adorable.<br> - You want to do some dishes for me?<br> - Put that down.<br> Here, Elijah. Here you go.<br> You know, I have an appointment<br> tomorrow with Elijah's shrink.<br> I think we're finally getting down<br> to the bottom...<br> ...of this acid stomach, aren't we?<br> Come here.<br> Get down from the...<br> She thinks that it's some sort<br> of childhood trauma.<br> Feelings of inadequacy as a chimp,<br> you know?<br> Careful. Isn't that interesting?<br> I find it really interesting.<br> So, honey, have you thought any more<br> about us having a baby?<br> I think it's just so tough right now,<br> economically and all...<br> ...that I think maybe we should just wait<br> and see if this job thing pays off.<br> You know?<br> I was thinking about what you said<br> the other day...<br> ...about the orientation film being bullshit.<br> - Yes?<br> I think maybe you're on to something.<br> - And 50 other lines to get in a girl's pants.<br> - No, no!<br> No, I was just talking about the film.<br> Here's the thing.<br> If you ever got me, you wouldn't<br> have a clue what to do with me.<br> I wasn't. I was talking about the film.<br> What magic those fingers could work<br> on the right cabinet.<br> Maybe you could alphabetize me.<br> And don't forget...<br> ..."I" comes before "U".<br> Floris, I think you're very nice...<br> ...but the truth is that I'm in love<br> with someone else.<br> I'm afraid I have no idea<br> what you're saying to me.<br> - You bastard.<br> - What?<br> - Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.<br> - No.<br> If I was 80 years younger, I'd box your ears.<br> I wasn't toying with her, sir. I wouldn't...<br> - Pardon me. How old are you, sir?<br> - 105.<br> Carrot juice, and lots of it.<br> I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.<br> I piss orange.<br> And I have to piss sitting down...<br> ...like a goddamn girly-girl,<br> every 15 minutes.<br> But nobody wants to die.<br> To be a young man again.<br> Maybe then Floris would care for me.<br> The elderly have so much to offer.<br> They're our link with history.<br> I don't wanna be your goddamn link,<br> damn ya.<br> I want to feel Floris's naked thighs<br> next to mine.<br> I want my body to inspire lust...<br> ...in that beautiful, complex woman.<br> I want her to shiver<br> with a spasm of ecstasy...<br> ...as I penetrate her wet...<br> Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered<br> you would share your feelings with me...<br> ...the workplace isn't the most suitable<br> environment for this type of discussion.<br> You're right. I'll tell you what.<br> Meet me after work today<br> at Jerry's Juiceteria on Lex...<br> ...and I'll spill my goddamn guts for ya.<br> No, I won't be late, Lotte.<br> I just have to, you know...<br> ...listen to Lester's sexual fantasies<br> and drink carrot juice for a while.<br> It's a job thing, really.<br> So, I'll talk to you later, okay?<br> Yeah. You, too.<br> Gotta go back to work. Okay, bye.<br> Hi. Do you know that I don't even know<br> your name or where you work?<br> Yeah.<br> How about this?<br> If I can guess your name in three tries,<br> you have to have a drink with me tonight.<br> Why not?<br> Okay.<br> You look like a...<br> ...Bar...<br> ...Ru...<br> ...Bell...<br> ...Carol...<br> ...Ta, Cher...<br> ...Susan...<br> ...Emily...<br> ...Marlar...<br> ...Maxine. Maxine?<br> Yeah! Who told you?<br> Nobody told me.<br> That just came out. Isn't that odd?<br> So where do you live and stuff?<br> I am dubious...<br> ...but I don't welsh.<br> Okay, meet me at The Stuck Pig, 7:00.<br> If you're late, I walk.<br> Nubile. Blonde.<br> Wet with desire. Me in leather.<br> A harness, if you like.<br> And all eyes, Craig,<br> are upon me as I speak.<br> "Ladies", I begin.<br> "I am the love god Eros." They like that.<br> "I intoxicate you."<br> "My spunk is, to you, manna from heaven."<br> Dr. Lester, this is all really fascinating<br> and stuff...<br> ...but I gotta get back home to my wife.<br> - You have a wife. I'd like to meet her.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Shall we say dinner Thursday?<br> You can come, too, if you like.<br> Get that? That was a joke.<br> You hear what I said? You can come, too.<br> That was a good one.<br> - All right. Thank you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Maxine.<br> - I made it, Maxine.<br> - Just.<br> Buy you a drink, Maxine?<br> Are you married?<br> - Yeah. But enough about me.<br> - Yeah.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - I'll have more of the same, please, Barry.<br> And I'll have a light beer, or something.<br> So...<br> I don't know, I like you.<br> - I don't know what it is about you. I just...<br> - My tits?<br> - No!<br> - No?<br> It's your energy,<br> the way you carry yourself.<br> You're not a fag, are you?<br> No. I am really attracted to you.<br> "I am really attracted to you."<br> You are a fag.<br> Well, we can share recipes, Darlene.<br> - Wait! I love your tits. I wanna fuck 'em.<br> - Now we're gettin' somewhere.<br> Not a chance.<br> So tell me about yourself.<br> If you can get your mind<br> out of the gutter long enough, dog boy.<br> Well, I'm a puppeteer.<br> - I've been...<br> - Check.<br> I'm sorry I'm so late.<br> Lester just wouldn't let me get away.<br> Hi, Elijah. We're supposed to have dinner<br> with him on Thursday...<br> ...but I can get us out of it, if you want.<br> It's amazing. He's like this insane old lech,<br> and it's kind of amusing...<br> ...once you get past<br> how disgusting it actually is.<br> - Did you eat?<br> - No. I'm not hungry.<br> I'm sorry I didn't call.<br> It was just hard to get away.<br> - I was worried.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> You know...<br> ...you wanted me to work.<br> How was your evening?<br> Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.<br> - The ferret?<br> - The iguana.<br> So I just dressed the wound...<br> ...and I've just been feeding everyone<br> and putting everybody to bed.<br> - You want a beer?<br> - No. I think I'm going to go to bed.<br> Elijah's gonna sleep with us tonight.<br> - I don't think he's feeling very well.<br> - Okay.<br> You know what? I'm gonna go<br> in my workshop for a little while.<br> - But I'll be in in a little while.<br> - Okay.<br> Tell me, why do you love puppeteering?<br> Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.<br> Perhaps it's the idea of becoming<br> someone else for a little while.<br> Being inside another skin...<br> ...thinking differently, moving differently...<br> ...feeling differently.<br> Interesting, Craig.<br> Would you like to be inside my skin...<br> ...think what I think, feel what I feel?<br> More than anything, Maxine.<br> It's good in here, Craig.<br> It's better than your wildest dreams.<br> You're not somebody<br> I could get interested in.<br> You play with dolls.<br> Puppets, Maxine.<br> It's the idea of being inside<br> someone else's skin...<br> ...and seeing what they see<br> and feeling what they feel.<br> Yikes!<br> It's just that, well...<br> Please, let me explain.<br> I've never done this before, but...<br> ...I feel something for you,<br> and I've never felt this way before...<br> ...you know, about anybody,<br> not even my wife.<br> And I just...<br> I really feel that you and I belong together.<br> Shit.<br> What's the file number?<br> You know what?<br> The puppeteer told me he loved me today.<br> I know. I can't think<br> of anything more pathetic.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Afternoon, sir.<br> The Broadhurst Theatre, please.<br> Say, ain't you that actor guy?<br> Yes.<br> John, what is, John...<br> Don't tell me. Maplethorpe?<br> - Malkovich.<br> - Malkovich. Right.<br> Yeah. I thought you were all right<br> in that one movie.<br> Thank you.<br> The one where you played a jewel thief.<br> - I never played a jewel thief.<br> - No?<br> - Who am I thinkin' of?<br> - I don't know.<br> No, no, I'm pretty sure it was you.<br> Yeah. Absolutely, doll.<br> I'm just about to close up.<br> Wanna meet at The Pig in 20 minutes?<br> Cool. Bye.<br> I'm splittin' for the day, puppet man.<br> Lock up for me, okay?<br> Don't you wanna know<br> what happened to me?<br> No.<br> - Please, this is important.<br> - Better be.<br> It is.<br> There's a tiny door in my office, Maxine.<br> It's a portal, and it takes you<br> inside John Malkovich.<br> You see the world<br> through John Malkovich's eyes...<br> ...and then after 15 minutes,<br> you're spit out...<br> ...into a ditch on the side<br> of the New Jersey Turnpike.<br> Sounds great!<br> Who the fuck is John Malkovich?<br> He's an actor. He's one of the great<br> American actors of the 20th century.<br> Oh, yeah? What's he been in?<br> Lots of things. That jewel thief movie.<br> He's very well-respected.<br> Anyway, the point is...<br> ...this is a very odd thing.<br> It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.<br> I mean, it raises all sorts<br> of philosophical-type questions...<br> ...about the nature of self,<br> about the existence of a soul.<br> You know, am I me?<br> Is Malkovich Malkovich?<br> I had a piece of wood in my hand, Maxine.<br> I don't have it any more. Where is it?<br> Did it disappear? How could that be?<br> Is it still in Malkovich's head?<br> I don't know!<br> Do you see what a metaphysical<br> can of worms this portal is?<br> I don't see how I could go on living my life<br> the way I've lived it before.<br> Yeah?<br> So I've been thinking,<br> is this Malkovich fellow appealing?<br> Maxine! Yes, of course, Maxine.<br> He's a celebrity.<br> Good. We'll sell tickets.<br> - Tickets to Malkovich?<br> - Exactly.<br> $200 a pop.<br> But, Maxine, there's something,<br> I don't know, like, profound here.<br> I don't know if we should exploit it.<br> You think?<br> I need you for this, Craigy.<br> You're my man on the inside.<br> You need me? I'm your man?<br> Sure, whatever.<br> Hey everybody, I'm home.<br> - Treats for everyone.<br> - Maxine?<br> - Yeah?<br> - We don't know the significance of this.<br> It might be dangerous to toy with?<br> I'll protect you, doll face.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Who was that?<br> I'm going to be working a lot of late nights<br> with this partner...<br> ...'cause Lestercorp's open during the day,<br> so I'll be working a lot of nights.<br> It's a good thing. It'll get us<br> out of the hole financially...<br> ...'cause we're gonna turn it<br> into a business.<br> But I don't understand.<br> There's no such thing as a hole,<br> or a portal into somebody's brain.<br> Yes, there is. A brain or soul or whatever.<br> I was inside John Malkovich lookin' out.<br> - Really?<br> - Yep.<br> - I wanna try it then.<br> - Pardon?<br> I want to be John Malkovich tomorrow.<br> That'd be perfect,<br> 'cause then I can meet your partner.<br> The thing is, Lestercorp's open during<br> the day, so we can't go during the day.<br> But if you want to, we can do it right now.<br> - Now? Right now?<br> - Tonight, on the way to Lester's.<br> I'll meet you on the side of the road<br> by the New Jersey Turnpike.<br> I'm scared.<br> You don't have to do this, you know.<br> No.<br> No, I wanna go.<br> - You sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's wet.<br> Weird.<br> That's nice.<br> God, I feel sexy.<br> Lotte, are you all right?<br> Craig, I gotta go back!<br> - No!<br> - Maybe tomorrow.<br> - No! I gotta go back now!<br> - We'll talk about it later.<br> Being inside did something to me.<br> I knew who I was.<br> It's like everything made sense.<br> I knew who I was.<br> But you weren't you.<br> You were John Malkovich.<br> God, I was. I was, wasn't I?<br> I was John Malkovich.<br> I was John fucking Malkovich!<br> - Take me back, Craig.<br> - We're late for Lester.<br> So tell me, Lotte,<br> can you understand a word I'm saying?<br> Oh, yes, Dr. Lester. Absolutely.<br> You were just explaining<br> the nutritional value...<br> ...of ingesting minerals through a colloidal<br> form which I couldn't agree more with.<br> Be still, my heart.<br> Dr. Lester, would you point me<br> in the direction of the restroom?<br> With the greatest pleasure, my dear.<br> You go up the grand "escalier"...<br> ...and once atop the stairs you'll want<br> to enter the fifth door on my left.<br> - Watch the step down. It's sunken.<br> - Okay. Thank you.<br> What do you think Lester's relationship<br> with John Malkovich is?<br> That portal's been boarded up forever.<br> I bet Lester's not even aware of it, him,<br> the portal. Why?<br> No reason. I was just thinking.<br> Do you think that it's kind of weird<br> that John Malkovich has a portal?<br> Do you think it might have some sort<br> of significance, for example?<br> I don't know. Why do you think that?<br> I don't even care.<br> I think it's kind of sexy<br> that John Malkovich has a portal.<br> Sort of like he's a vagina.<br> It's sort of vaginal, like he has a...<br> ...he has a penis and a vagina.<br> It's sort of like...<br> ...Malkovich's feminine side.<br> I like that.<br> "Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building...<br> ...nightly from 9:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m."<br> Sounds good. Oblique, but intriguing.<br> Phone it in.<br> - Want me to phone it in?<br> - No.<br> - Lotte!<br> - Hi.<br> - I heard your voice.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> Is this your partner? She's pretty.<br> I had to do the Malkovich ride again,<br> you know? Is this her?<br> - Hi. You're Craig's wife?<br> - Yeah. Hi.<br> Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.<br> - Have you done Malkovich yet?<br> - Hi. Yeah, I want to place an ad.<br> Okay. "Ever want to be someone else?"<br> No, that's the ad, but we can talk<br> about you in a minute.<br> "Ever want to be someone else?"<br> "Now you can. Visit J.M. Inc."<br> "Inc. Mertin."<br> "M-E-R-T-I-N. Flemmer."<br> You should really be at work.<br> I've been going over and over<br> my experience last night, Craig.<br> It was amazing.<br> I've decided...<br> ...that I'm a transsexual.<br> - I know it's the craziest thing, Craig!<br> - Are you fuckin' nuts?<br> No. It's just that for the first time,<br> everything just felt right.<br> I've got to make sure.<br> But if the feeling is still there...<br> ...I'm going to talk to Dr. Feldman<br> about sexual reassignment surgery.<br> This is absurd!<br> Besides, Feldman is an allergist.<br> If you're going to do something, do it right.<br> You get these half-assed ideas<br> and do a half-assed job.<br> Just drop it.<br> It's just that I really like Dr. Feldman.<br> All right?<br> So I thought<br> that I would ask him his opinion.<br> Is there something so terrible about that?<br> - Why do you always yell at me like this?<br> - Sweetie, I'm sorry.<br> It's just a phase. It's the thrill of seeing<br> through somebody else's eyes.<br> Okay? It'll pass.<br> Don't stand in the way<br> of my actualization as a man.<br> Let her go, Craig.<br> - Okay.<br> - I mean him.<br> Right now?<br> It's the middle of the day.<br> How will I get her past Lester?<br> - Yawn. Figure it out.<br> - Okay.<br> Let's go. Come on.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Davey, it's Max.<br> Listen, can you get me<br> John Malkovich's home phone?<br> "But what I had been through."<br> "I am hungry as the winter."<br> "I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar."<br> "Fate has tossed me hither and thither."<br> "I have been everywhere. Everywhere."<br> - "So strong."<br> - "But wherever I have been..."<br> - "...every minute, day and night..."<br> - I want that voice.<br> - "...my soul has been full..."<br> - "My soul has been full..."<br> - "...of mysterious anticipation."<br> - "I feel the approach of happiness."<br> "Anya, I see it coming."<br> - Yeah?<br> - Mr. John Malkovich?<br> - Yeah. Who's calling?<br> - Oh, my goodness!<br> You don't know me, but I know you.<br> I'm a great admirer of yours.<br> How did you get this number?<br> It's just that...<br> ... I dream about you.<br> And well, even speaking to you now<br> has gotten me sort of excited, you know?<br> The way this woman's talking to him.<br> Listen, I really don't find this amusing.<br> Don't call here anymore, okay?<br> My nipples are at attention,<br> General Malkovich, sir.<br> What, her nipples?<br> So why don't we have dinner tonight?<br> Bernardo's? 8:00?<br> I really want to see you.<br> I just loved you in that jewel thief movie.<br> You're not gonna meet her there?<br> Come on!<br> Meet her. Meet here there.<br> - Meet her there!<br> - "...as the winter."<br> "I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar."<br> - Meet her there!<br> - "Fate has tossed me hither and thither."<br> "I have been everywhere. Everywhere."<br> "But wherever I have been,<br> every minute, day and night..."<br> Meet her there. Meet her there.<br> Yes!<br> - How was it?<br> - I have to go back at 8:00 exactly tonight.<br> - Why?<br> - Don't crowd me, Craig.<br> - Excuse me. Are you John Malkovich?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> Wow. You really are great in that movie<br> where you play that retard.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - I have a cousin who's a retard.<br> - Thank you.<br> So, as you might imagine,<br> it means a lot to me...<br> ...to see retards...<br> ...portrayed on the silver screen<br> so compassionately.<br> Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.<br> Good night.<br> - Maxine? It's Maxine.<br> - Hi.<br> I'm so glad you decided to come.<br> I'm Maxine.<br> I'm John. How do you do?<br> Good.<br> I wasn't sure I was going to come,<br> but I felt oddly compelled.<br> You're so beautiful.<br> The way you're looking at me,<br> I mean, at him, at us.<br> I've never been looked at like this<br> by a woman before.<br> I think I'm sweating.<br> I must say, I was intrigued by your voice.<br> And the funny thing is, Mr. Malkovich...<br> ...my voice is probably<br> the least intriguing thing about me.<br> So, I mean, how was it?<br> What was he doing?<br> He wasn't doing anything, really.<br> He was just hanging around his apartment.<br> I think he's probably<br> just a really Ionely guy.<br> See, men can feel unfulfilled too, Lotte.<br> I'm glad you're finally realizing that.<br> You shouldn't assume<br> that switching bodies...<br> ...is gonna be the answer to your problems.<br> You're right, Craig. You're right.<br> You know what I was thinking?<br> I was thinking that maybe...<br> ...we should invite Maxine<br> over for dinner one night...<br> ...because you're partners and<br> I thought it might be a really nice gesture.<br> - I think she'd like that.<br> - Maxine?<br> The thing is, there's been some tension<br> between us at work...<br> ...business stuff,<br> and I would hate to expose you to that.<br> It'll be okay.<br> I'll cook my lasagna,<br> we'll smoke a joint, and...<br> ...tensions will just melt away.<br> Now, when you say that I can be<br> somebody else, what do you mean exactly?<br> Well, we mean exactly that.<br> We can put you inside someone else's body<br> for 15 minutes.<br> Can I be anybody that I wanna be?<br> - Actually...<br> - You can be John Malkovich.<br> That's perfect!<br> It's my second choice, but it's wonderful.<br> I'm a fat man. I am sad and fat...<br> $200?<br> Yes.<br> Okay. You gotta crawl in there.<br> Oh, my God.<br> No, that's what I'm saying.<br> See, I don't really need an extra bath mat.<br> So if I get the set, would it be possible...<br> ...if I could just get maybe three...<br> ...extra hand towels...<br> ...if I get the set, instead of the bath mat?<br> - Yes, sir. Sure, we can do that.<br> - Great. That sounds good.<br> And for the color: Periwinkle?<br> I'm sorry. We're out of stock in periwinkle.<br> Do you want to back order?<br> No. I'll go with the Ioden.<br> Would you like to order anything else?<br> What is the difference between<br> the foot-pampering, looped cotton rug...<br> ...and the bath mat?<br> You're my friends. Thank you.<br> Did you know that Eskimos have not one...<br> ...but...<br> ...forty-nine words for snow?<br> It's because they have so much of it.<br> So much snow.<br> After dinner, I'll show you my puppets.<br> After dinner, I'll introduce you<br> to my chimp Elijah.<br> He has an ulcer right now<br> due to suppressed childhood trauma...<br> ...but we're working through it.<br> Psychotherapy.<br> - This the bedroom?<br> - Yeah.<br> The thing is, the way that I see it...<br> ...I think the world is divided...<br> ...into those who go after what they want<br> and then those who don't, right?<br> - Right.<br> - The passionate ones...<br> ...the ones who go after what they want...<br> ...well, they may not get what they want.<br> But at least they remain vital.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> So when they lie on their death beds,<br> they have few regrets.<br> Right?<br> And the ones who don't go after<br> what they want...<br> ...well, who gives a shit<br> about them anyway?<br> - Lotte!<br> - Craig!<br> I don't find you attractive.<br> And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you.<br> I am. But only when you're in Malkovich.<br> When I looked into his eyes last night,<br> I could feel you peering out.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Behind the stubble and the too-prominent<br> brow and the male-pattern baldness...<br> ...I sensed your feminine longing.<br> And it just slew me.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Only as John, sweetie. Sorry.<br> Thanks for a wonderful dinner.<br> No hard feelings, partner?<br> J.M. Inc.<br> Hi. It's Lotte.<br> I'd like very much to see you again.<br> Can you call him and invite yourself over?<br> When?<br> Tonight after you close?<br> Okay, 4:11.<br> - Thank you, Maxine.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Thanks so much for having me over,<br> sugarplum.<br> I'm glad you called.<br> Shall we to the "boudoir"?<br> A couple of minutes. I'm early.<br> So do you enjoy being an actor?<br> Sure. It's very rewarding.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> My sweet Maxine.<br> - My darling.<br> - I love you, Lotte.<br> Did you call me Lotte?<br> Do you mind?<br> No, not really.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - My sweet, beautiful Lotte.<br> Maxine!<br> Yes, Maxine. Yes.<br> Maxine, this is so right.<br> - You were him, weren't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> And he was with her!<br> We love her, Craig.<br> - We?<br> - John and me.<br> Don't forget about me!<br> You have the Maxine action figure<br> to play with!<br> I'm sorry. That was nasty.<br> You are late, my little cowboy.<br> Are you torturing me on purpose?<br> - I've fallen in love.<br> - I don't think so.<br> You know why?<br> Because I've fallen in love!<br> This is what people<br> who've fallen in love look like.<br> You picked the unrequited variety.<br> It's very bad for the skin.<br> You're evil, Maxine.<br> Do you have any idea what it's like<br> to have two people look at you...<br> ...with total lust and devotion...<br> ...through the same pair of eyes?<br> No, I don't suppose you would.<br> It's quite a thrill, Craigy.<br> What are you doing?<br> - Oh, my God! Is that real? What is that?<br> - Yes!<br> I don't know how to use it very well,<br> so don't make any sudden moves!<br> I'm serious! I'm serious.<br> Suck my dick!<br> Shut up, okay? Just shut up.<br> - Craig!<br> - Tell her you need to see her.<br> J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.<br> I need to see you.<br> Sweetie!<br> I had so much fun with you last night.<br> Shoot. But it's business hours.<br> Tell her, "What the hell,<br> close early, live dangerously."<br> Say it.<br> What the hell, you know?<br> Live dangerously. Close early.<br> Doll.<br> I love this new devil-may-care side of you.<br> All right. I'll track down lover-boy<br> and see both of you in one hour.<br> Exactamundo.<br> - What's the matter with you? Stop it!<br> - Sit up, okay? Just sit up. Just sit up.<br> Help! He's locking me in a cage!<br> Shut the hell up!<br> Shut up!<br> "Was ever woman in this humor wooed?"<br> "Was ever woman in this humor won?"<br> Tommy, can I take 15?<br> Good night, everybody.<br> See you back here at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.<br> Lotte, this is so good!<br> My God! This is amazing.<br> I want to touch her breast.<br> Touch her breast.<br> Move right hand across left breast now.<br> Move right hand across left breast now!<br> Move right hand across left breast now!<br> - Holy shit, yes!<br> - Holy shit, yes!<br> - Holy shit, he said what I said!<br> - Shit, he said what I said!<br> - Lotte? Is that you?<br> - Yes, yes, sweetheart.<br> Yes, sweetheart, yes.<br> What the fuck is going on?<br> That's not me! I didn't say that.<br> - Lotte.<br> - Maxine.<br> Something was making me talk.<br> Some goddamn thing<br> was making me move.<br> - I've gotta get out of here.<br> - Doll face!<br> It was just your passion for me taking hold.<br> No, doll face. I know what<br> my passion taking hold feels like.<br> Bye!<br> I did it!<br> I made him move his arm<br> across your girlfriend's glorious tit!<br> And I made him talk, sort of.<br> It's just a matter of practice<br> before Malkovich...<br> ...is nothing more than another puppet<br> hanging next to my work table.<br> I'll tell you about it when I get home, okay?<br> All right?<br> Craig! I wanna...<br> No, man, I'm sorry...<br> ...I'm sorry to have called you like that,<br> but I was just really scared.<br> I was so freaked out.<br> I mean, it was like, somebody was<br> just moving all the way through me...<br> ...moving my arms, moving my hands,<br> talking for me.<br> I mean, literally,<br> I feel like I'm going crazy, Charlie.<br> I'm sure you're not going crazy.<br> You don't understand, man.<br> It was like nothing I've ever felt before.<br> - Were you stoned?<br> - Yes, I was...<br> Jesus.<br> Yes, I was stoned.<br> But that doesn't have<br> anything to do with it.<br> Charlie, someone was talking<br> through my mouth.<br> You were stoned.<br> Case closed. End of story.<br> - How hot is this babe?<br> - You know what?<br> Maybe it was this Lotte woman talking...<br> ...because it could have been her<br> talking through me.<br> Because the weird thing is...<br> ...this Maxine likes to call me Lotte.<br> Ouch. That is hot.<br> Maybe she's using you<br> to channel some dead, lesbian lover.<br> She's my kind of gal.<br> Tell me when you're done with her.<br> What are you talking about,<br> "done with her"? Tonight freaked me out.<br> You're nuts to let a girl go<br> that calls you Lotte.<br> I don't know anything about the girl.<br> She could be a fucking witch or something.<br> That's even better!<br> Hot, lesbian witches.<br> Think about it. It's fucking genius.<br> I gotta know the truth, Charlie.<br> The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy.<br> Thanks.<br> This way.<br> Excuse me. Exactly what type of service<br> does this company provide?<br> You get to be John Malkovich<br> for 15 minutes.<br> I see.<br> - No cutting, by the way.<br> - No cutting!<br> Come on! Break it up!<br> Break it up! Cut it out!<br> Everybody gets...<br> It's him. It's John Malkovich.<br> Sorry, Mr. Malkovich.<br> Hope we didn't hurt you too terribly.<br> Get inside!<br> - Darling!<br> - What the fuck is going on?<br> John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich, sir.<br> - Mr. Malkovich, I think I can explain.<br> - Yeah, explain.<br> My name is Craig Schwartz...<br> ...and we operate a little business here...<br> ...that simulates for our clientele...<br> ...the experience...<br> ...of being you, actually.<br> - Simulates?<br> - Yeah, after a fashion.<br> - What exactly does that mean?<br> - Well, it's hard to describe.<br> I want to do it.<br> That'd pale compared<br> to the real experience.<br> - I want to do it!<br> - Right now Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube...<br> - Let him do it, Craig.<br> - Of course.<br> Right this way, Mr. Malkovich,<br> compliments of the house.<br> Jesus.<br> What happens when a man<br> goes through his own portal?<br> We'll see.<br> Malkovich.<br> Malkovich. Malkovich.<br> - How was it?<br> - It was amazing this time.<br> - That was no simulation!<br> - I know. I'm sorry.<br> It's an honor.<br> I have been to the dark side.<br> I've seen a world that no man should see!<br> Really? For most people,<br> it's a rather pleasant experience.<br> That portal is mine,<br> and it must be sealed forever...<br> ...for the love of God.<br> But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,<br> with all due respect...<br> ...I discovered that portal.<br> It's my livelihood. You understand?<br> It's my head, Schwartz! It's my head!<br> I will see you in court!<br> What makes you think<br> I won't be seeing what you're seeing...<br> ...in court?<br> Hey, Malkovich, think fast!<br> Fuck!<br> Dinner.<br> You know, Craig,<br> once this was a relationship...<br> ...built on love.<br> Well, you gave up that claim...<br> ...after the first time you stuck your dick<br> in Maxine, Lotte.<br> You fell in love with her first, Craig.<br> But I didn't do anything about it,<br> out of respect for our marriage.<br> You didn't do anything about it, Craig...<br> ...because she wouldn't let you near her<br> with a 10-foot pole!<br> That's true.<br> God, Lotte, what have I become?<br> My wife, in a cage with a monkey.<br> I need to go to the bathroom<br> and take a shower.<br> What am I, some kind of monster?<br> I don't want to be a monster, Lotte,<br> I don't want to.<br> Craig, you're not a monster. No.<br> I know you're not a monster, honey.<br> You're just...<br> ...a very, very confused man.<br> I love you so much.<br> I love you.<br> Come on, Craig.<br> - J.M. Inc.<br> - Maxine.<br> Lotte.<br> I've been thinking about us, you know?<br> We have to meet.<br> Okay, I'll see you in Malkovich in one hour.<br> Craig!<br> I hate you.<br> Elijah!<br> You really are magnificent.<br> - J.M. Inc.<br> - Maxine!<br> Honey pie! I was just heading<br> out the door to meet you.<br> Listen, Maxine.<br> It hasn't been me in Malkovich last time.<br> It's been that son of a bitch Craig.<br> He had me locked in a cage with my chimp,<br> holding a gun to my head.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - He made me call you.<br> I'm sorry, Maxine.<br> It's been him the whole time.<br> I'm so sorry. That's horrible.<br> I miss you so much, Maxine.<br> So, but...<br> ...that was Craig inside of Malkovich?<br> - Yes, it was him.<br> It's because he's a puppeteer, I think.<br> Well, boy, I'm...<br> I'm surprised. That's pretty impressive.<br> - What?<br> - So if Craig can control Malkovich...<br> - ... and I can control Craig...<br> - But, Maxine...<br> ...I thought it was me that you loved!<br> I do.<br> It's confusing, you know?<br> This is a very confusing situation.<br> I know.<br> Listen, I should really get going, okay?<br> 'Cause I'm gonna be late<br> for Malkovich now.<br> - What?<br> - We'll talk about this later.<br> - Maxine! Wait!<br> - Okay?<br> What the fuck do you want?<br> I can explain about the portal, darling.<br> Listen, don't con me, Maxine.<br> I don't know who the hell you people are,<br> but this insanity is now over.<br> Shut up.<br> Craigy. Craig.<br> Schwartzy, are you in there?<br> How did you know it was me?<br> Lotte called me.<br> She escaped your evil clutches.<br> Really? Well, I'm really sorry<br> I did that, Maxine...<br> ...but I'm really in love with you,<br> and I didn't know how else to be with you.<br> Apparently you can control<br> this Malkovich fellow now?<br> Yes, I'm getting better all the time.<br> I'll say you are.<br> Hey, let's do it on his dining room table.<br> Then we'll make him<br> eat an omelet off of it.<br> No!<br> Shut up, you overrated sack of shit!<br> Craigy.<br> Yes?<br> Hi, Dr. Lester.<br> It's Lotte Schwartz, Craig's wife.<br> Yes.<br> Oh, my God.<br> You'll catch your death out here.<br> Look at you. You're soaking wet.<br> Please come in, come in.<br> - Here you are, my dear.<br> - Thank you.<br> How's that?<br> Much better, thank you.<br> So, my dear...<br> ...what is it that brings you to my doorway<br> on such an inhospitable evening?<br> Well, Dr. Lester...<br> See, I...<br> I have a very unhealthy obsession<br> with John Malkovich.<br> I see.<br> You mean, the performer.<br> Yes.<br> And what prompted you<br> to come to me with this issue?<br> Well, when I was here<br> with my husband for dinner...<br> ...I came upon a room that seemed to be<br> some sort of John Malkovich museum.<br> So I thought, perhaps, maybe you would...<br> ...have some appreciation<br> for my state of mind.<br> You look so lovely, my dear...<br> ...standing before the fire<br> in my oversized man's robe.<br> Thank you, Dr. Lester.<br> Tell me...<br> ...what is this strange power<br> that Malkovich exudes?<br> You've gotta help me understand.<br> All I think about is wanting to be him.<br> - Wanting to what?<br> - Wanting to be him.<br> Wanting to be John Malkovich.<br> I see.<br> Well, perhaps you can.<br> But, Dr. Lester...<br> I am not Dr. Lester.<br> I am Captain Mertin.<br> I don't understand.<br> It was 90 years ago<br> that I discovered a strange portal.<br> And I found that this portal led<br> to a vessel body...<br> ...and that I could live forever<br> by leaping from vessel to vessel.<br> - So Dr. Lester is such a vessel?<br> - Yes, he is.<br> You still there, sweets?<br> I figured out how to hang on<br> as long as I want.<br> It's all a matter of making friends<br> with the Malkovich body.<br> Rather than thinking of it as an enemy<br> that has to be pounded into submission...<br> ...I've begun imagining it<br> as a really expensive suit...<br> ...that I enjoy wearing.<br> This illustrates...<br> ...how I will move<br> into my next vessel, Malkovich...<br> ...on his 44th birthday.<br> That's when he becomes ripe.<br> But I must enter by midnight on that day.<br> After that, I'd get diverted<br> into the next newly forming infant vessel.<br> I don't want that to happen.<br> - I'd be absorbed.<br> - Absorbed? What does that mean?<br> Well, trapped, held prisoner,<br> if you like, in the host's brain...<br> ...unable to control anything...<br> ...forever doomed to watch the world<br> through someone else's eyes.<br> Now I'd like you to meet some friends.<br> See, I got Ionely in Lester by myself...<br> ...so I figured out a way this time<br> to take others along with me.<br> Come.<br> Everyone, this is Lotte.<br> - Hi, Lotte!<br> - She's a new friend of mine.<br> Do a puppet show for me, Craig, honey.<br> You mean, with Malkovich?<br> - I'd love to see your work.<br> - Really?<br> Okay.<br> This is something that I call:<br> "Craig's Dance of Despair<br> and Disillusionment."<br> That was incredible! You're brilliant!<br> You see, Maxine,<br> it isn't just playing with dolls.<br> My darling, it's so much more!<br> It's playing with people.<br> Stay in him forever.<br> How will we make a living<br> if our clientele can't access to our product?<br> Well, we'll have all the money<br> in Malkovich's bank account...<br> ...plus he does get<br> acting work occasionally.<br> No, please!<br> Shut up! We're trying to think here.<br> It is sort of like puppeteering.<br> - I like that about it.<br> - Exactly!<br> And no one would ever even<br> have to know it's not him.<br> And I could use Malkovich's<br> existing notoriety...<br> ...to launch my own puppeteering career.<br> Craigy, that's brilliant.<br> So lovely. I've always wondered<br> what it would be like to have a penis.<br> - Now I'll know.<br> - Really? I know it's very...<br> Lotte? We like you.<br> We can see you're a kind<br> and decent woman...<br> ...and so...<br> ...we've decided to offer you a place<br> in John Malkovich with us...<br> ...if you like.<br> Dr. Lester...<br> ...you've been so kind to me...<br> ...and trusting.<br> And...<br> ...there's something I think you should<br> know about the Malkovich vessel.<br> John's here to see you.<br> Should I send him in?<br> Of course send him right in. Don't ever<br> keep him waiting again, you understand?<br> Hey, John.<br> Great to see you.<br> Sorry about the cunt at reception.<br> - This is my fiance, Maxine.<br> - Great to see you, Maxine.<br> Sorry about the cunt at reception.<br> Please, have a seat.<br> Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?<br> No, thank you.<br> - Teresa, get me chicken soup.<br> - Okay.<br> Chicken soup?<br> Larry? I want to get right to the point.<br> From now on, I'm no longer an actor.<br> I'm a puppeteer.<br> Okay. Great.<br> And I would like to redirect my career...<br> ...so that from now on<br> the name John Malkovich...<br> ...will be synonymous with puppets.<br> Sure. No problemo.<br> Poof, you're a puppeteer.<br> Just let me make a couple calls.<br> Honey? Maxine?<br> Maxine?<br> I'm busy.<br> Maxine, honey, it's on!<br> Yeah, there's the truth, and there are lies...<br> ... and, art always tells the truth,<br> even when it's lying.<br> The enigmatic John Malkovich...<br> ... one of the world's greatest entertainers<br> and the man who reinvented...<br> ... how we view puppeteering.<br> Tonight we look at the man<br> above the strings...<br> ... and the woman behind the man.<br> Raised in Evanston, Illinois, Malkovich<br> had a lifelong interest in theatre arts...<br> ... and as a young man,<br> was one of the founding members...<br> ... of Chicago's world-renowned<br> Steppenwolf Theatre Company.<br> From there, it was a simple transition<br> to Broadway accolades...<br> ... and Hollywood stardom.<br> But nothing could prepare the public<br> for what was to come next.<br> And so it was,<br> that just eight short months ago...<br> ... John Malkovich dropped the bombshell<br> that sent shock waves...<br> ... through the entertainment community.<br> Turning his back on his former profession,<br> Malkovich had to start from scratch...<br> ... and pay his dues all over again<br> as a fledgling puppeteer.<br> Hello, ladies and gentlemen,<br> I'm John Malkovich.<br> I'm really John Malkovich.<br> From these inauspicious beginnings...<br> ... John Malkovich's rise to stardom<br> was fast and furious.<br> His breakout performance was<br> at this year's Emmy Awards...<br> It's really good! I look really amazing.<br> I'd fuck me.<br> If there's anything that upsets me<br> about it...<br> ... it's feeling like if I move<br> into it too quickly...<br> ... l'll be, you know, deemed an imitator.<br> But, I think that<br> once we all get the courage...<br> ... to follow through on our instincts,<br> like Malkovich has...<br> ... I think that a lot of us<br> will move into puppetry.<br> Malkovich's rise to fame brought about<br> a renaissance in puppeteering.<br> No, no, no. What are you doing?<br> I'm making him weep, John.<br> You're making him weep,<br> but you're not weeping.<br> Don't ever... with your audience.<br> Until the puppet becomes...<br> ... an extension of you, it's a novelty act.<br> It's Topo Gigio.<br> No?<br> He's a technical genius.<br> He breathes life into inanimate objects.<br> It's a very godlike thing...<br> ... to be able to take something and,<br> you know, make it live.<br> He was the talk of the town...<br> ... from the Beltway to Broadway...<br> ... aided in no small part by his new wife<br> and manager, Maxine Lund.<br> In Maxine,<br> Malkovich had found his mentor...<br> ... his muse, his inspiration.<br> In Malkovich,<br> Maxine had found the love of her life.<br> There, there, my dear. Relax.<br> This travesty will all be over with<br> by morning.<br> And the crowds have been<br> absolutely sensational...<br> ... and I'djust like to thank God<br> for giving us this opportunity...<br> ... to share our creative vision.<br> Nothing was impossible for John<br> and Maxine in the early days.<br> Their union was a joyous one,<br> and together they worked tirelessly...<br> ... to further Malkovich's<br> puppeteering career.<br> John Malkovich, the artist...<br> ... and Maxine, the entrepreneur...<br> ... they make this character...<br> ... this protean figure<br> that we call John Malkovich.<br> But some say Maxine has changed<br> since becoming pregnant...<br> ... recoiling from the limelight...<br> ... and, rumor has it,<br> from her husband's affections.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Malkovich shows us...<br> ... a reflection of ourselves, our frailties...<br> ... and our, you know, desperate humanity.<br> That's what makes him one<br> of the most relevant artists of our time.<br> And what does the future hold<br> for John Horatio Malkovich?<br> Well, to quote the Bard,<br> "He's got the world on a string."<br> As the poet said, "The puppeteer's voice<br> need not merely be the record of man."<br> "It can be one of the pillars, the props...<br> ...to help him endure and prevail",<br> and I believe that.<br> It's over!<br> Max?<br> I've gotta head down to ABT now.<br> I've got the "Swan Lake" benefit tonight.<br> But when I come back,<br> we can maybe celebrate...<br> ...Malkovich's big four-four.<br> Okay?<br> Jesus! Why couldn't I have found<br> the portal to a younger body?<br> What if I fall tonight and break my hip?<br> Like that, little girl?<br> Huh, lamb?<br> I love you.<br> Bravo!<br> Maxine?<br> Hello? Hello?<br> - We have Maxine.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Please, please, don't hurt her.<br> Listen, I'll give you<br> anything you want. Please.<br> You listen to me, asshole.<br> I don't want your fucking money.<br> What I want is for you<br> to leave John Malkovich now!<br> - Who is this, Lester?<br> - Does it matter?<br> We're gonna kill Maxine<br> if you don't leave the body immediately!<br> But I can't do that.<br> I mean, if I leave Malkovich,<br> then I'm Craig Schwartz again.<br> No career, no money.<br> Maxine will have nothing to do...<br> She barely has anything<br> to do with me now.<br> Jesus, we're going to kill your wife,<br> you fucking lunatic!<br> God.<br> Listen, Schwartz, Malkovich is our vessel.<br> We're old.<br> We're going to die if we don't<br> get into him by midnight...<br> He called our bluff.<br> Shit!<br> Can't we just go inside the portal<br> and push Craig out?<br> No, he's much too powerful.<br> Schwartz would just jam us down<br> into Malkovich's subconscious.<br> Lotte.<br> If I can't have you, no one will.<br> Lotte, no!<br> No, Lotte!<br> God, no, we can't really kill her!<br> She's carrying Malkovich's seed!<br> My next vessel!<br> Hey! Help me!<br> - Where the fuck am I?<br> - We're in Malkovich's subconscious.<br> The last thing you'll ever see, Maxine.<br> Fag-o-vitch!<br> Johnny, baby, Johnny.<br> Bad. I am bad. I am bad.<br> Maxine, I am gonna kill you!<br> You're creepy.<br> Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!<br> I loved you so much!<br> Why did you have to hurt me like that?<br> I'm sorry, Lotte.<br> I guess I loved you, too, in my way.<br> You are so full of shit, Maxine!<br> I know.<br> I know!<br> It's your baby, okay?<br> What?<br> The baby, it's yours.<br> It's ours. I got pregnant<br> when you were in Malkovich.<br> - You can't fuck with me any more, Maxine!<br> - I'm not!<br> I kept it because I knew<br> you were the father...<br> ...the other mother, whatever...<br> ...because it was yours.<br> So, we're parents?<br> Together?<br> Yeah.<br> - Aren't you John Malkovich?<br> - No.<br> - Yeah, you are.<br> - No.<br> I can't believe you're in this shithole, man.<br> - This is John Malkovich.<br> - I'm not John Malkovich.<br> - This is John Malkovich.<br> - I am not John Malkovich!<br> Yes?<br> Lester, please don't do it.<br> Please don't kill Maxine.<br> - So you'll leave?<br> - Yes, I am leaving.<br> All right. Do it now<br> while I'm on the phone so I can hear...<br> ...and your lovely bride walks.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> I'm going.<br> Now, my friends. The time is now.<br> I'm free.<br> I'm back!<br> Lotte.<br> Hello. Hello, young lady.<br> We're Malkovich.<br> Maxine! I did it, Maxine!<br> I left Malkovich for you, sweetie!<br> It's no good being Malkovich without you.<br> - It proves I love you!<br> - Fuck off!<br> - Doesn't it?<br> - He's not with us.<br> Maxine, I love you!<br> I'm gonna go right back into Malkovich,<br> and kick Lester out!<br> And then you'll love me again! Maxine!<br> - Machine.<br> - Hey. Malcatraz.<br> - How are you?<br> - I'm very well. And you?<br> - Good, good.<br> - You look well.<br> Thank you. How's Celeste?<br> She's good.<br> She's sorry she couldn't make it today.<br> - She had to go to the store.<br> - That's okay.<br> Charlie, hi! I didn't even hear the door.<br> - Lookin' great, Flo.<br> - I'm looking grateful?<br> Charlie, we are not getting any younger.<br> Well, don't rub it in.<br> Listen, Charlie,<br> I know this is going to sound crazy...<br> ...but what would you think<br> if I told you that I'd found a way...<br> ...for us to live forever?<br> All of us.<br> - Johnny boy, what are you talking about?<br> - All of us.<br> Celeste, Floris, you, me.<br> Gary Sinise, maybe.<br> I don't really understand.<br> Charlie, this is Emily.<br> Isn't she lovely?<br> Pass the Cheetos.<br> - You need more puffs?<br> - No, I want more.<br> - Okey-doke. They're covered in grease.<br> - Shut up.<br> - Can I swim yet?<br> - Can you swim yet?<br> - What time is it?<br> - Shall we do the cramp test?<br> Check her.<br> Let me see.<br> Are you gonna throw up? Let me see!<br> Are you gonna throw up?<br> Are you gonna vomit?<br> Okay, you can swim.<br> Maxine.<br> Maxine.<br> I love you, Maxine.<br> Oh, look away.<br>
