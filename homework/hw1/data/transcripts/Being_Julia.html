mmm-hmm.<br> what's she doing there?<br> exercising.<br> exercising?<br> what are you doing?<br> swimming the channel, what<br> do you think I'm doing?<br> yeah, but why?<br> miss Phillips said my<br> tummy needed tightening,<br> so I'm tightening it.<br> oh.<br> oh, yes, I had a thought.<br> we should take a country house<br> for the summer.<br> what do you think?<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> so do you think a house<br> for the summer's a good idea?<br> yes.<br> golf, swimming, tennis.<br> it'll be especially good<br> for Roger. he loves golf.<br> then he'll have to decide<br> what's he gonna do with his life.<br> I think he should go to university.<br> he doesn't want to,<br> and we shouldn't insist.<br> it's his life.<br> oh, yes, I had another idea.<br> you remember that young<br> chap I introduced you to?<br> which young chap?<br> that American. good-looking fellow.<br> remember?<br> no.<br> he wants to learn the business.<br> Tom Fennel is his name.<br> American, you must remember.<br> vaguely.<br> well, he's frightfully good at his job.<br> he's a wizard with money.<br> lots of American ideas for avoiding tax.<br> what about him?<br> well, I thought we might invite him down<br> for a couple of weeks to<br> spend his holiday with us.<br> why would we want to do that?<br> he'll be company for Roger.<br> he's only a bit older.<br> Roger will like him, I'm sure of it.<br> shall I ask him?<br> hmm.<br> ah!<br> remind me to keep exercising.<br> so, will you come and stay?<br> Michael says the house is<br> frightfully comfortable.<br> probably not.<br> I'm going abroad for a couple of months.<br> what fun.<br> well, you'll be busy, won't you?<br> looking for a new play, reading scripts.<br> so, what do you think?<br> he hasn't done justice to your eyes.<br> as a matter of fact,<br> there is a play that interests me.<br> it's about an older woman<br> who has an affair with a younger man.<br> oh, a farce.<br> why do you say that?<br> well, because everyone<br> laughs at the older woman.<br> no, not in this play. it's all serious.<br> the act 1 curtain's good.<br> it comes as a shock to her.<br> what does?<br> that she's fallen in love with the boy.<br> and it happens just when everything<br> seemed to her so dull and unpromising,<br> as if her life was over.<br> she finds the affair exhilarating.<br> and everyone keeps telling her<br> she looks 10 years younger.<br> I trust she doesn't confess to the boy<br> that she loves him. that's always fatal.<br> does it sound like something for me?<br> oh, don't be ridiculous, Julia.<br> no, your public would<br> never stand for it.<br> if such a woman asked me,<br> I know what advice I'd give her.<br> what? break it off at once.<br> it will only end in tears.<br> but, Charles, she can't do that.<br> why ever not?<br> because she's fallen in love with him,<br> that's why. she's helpless.<br> hmm.<br> the character in the play.<br> dolly, old thing,<br> how are you?<br> I haven't seen you for ages.<br> sit down and make yourself, uh,<br> comfy.<br> so, come to see that<br> the old firm's raking in<br> the dividends for you?<br> Michael, I'll come<br> straight to the point.<br> you know I'm not one to gossip,<br> but--but I'm<br> upset about Julia.<br> I think you ought to know that<br> people are beginning to talk.<br> what the devil do you mean?<br> well, it's absurd that at her age,<br> she should make herself so conspicuous<br> with a young boy.<br> oh, you mean tom fennel?<br> don't be such a fool, dolly.<br> I'm not a fool.<br> when someone is as well-known as Julia<br> and they're always seen with the<br> same man, naturally people talk.<br> tom fennel is a very<br> good type of American.<br> he's clean, honest and by<br> way of being a gentleman.<br> he's boring, dull, common and a snob.<br> he's just using Julia.<br> he's a little gold digger.<br> can you look me in the eyes, dolly,<br> and tell me you really think<br> Julia's having an affair with him?<br> no.<br> ah.<br> the truth is, Michael,<br> I've hardly seen her.<br> she never telephones anymore, and...<br> and...<br> I understand, dolly, believe me.<br> she's very fond of you, you know that,<br> but she's bound to have other friends.<br> I don't think chaps<br> should talk about their wives to others.<br> I think it's frightfully bad form<br> but let me explain<br> something to you about Julia.<br> sex doesn't mean a thing to her.<br> it was different in the beginning.<br> then she could be somewhat<br> tiresome sometimes.<br> but after she had Roger, she changed.<br> having a baby seemed to settle her.<br> all those instincts went<br> into her acting, you see.<br> gossip isn't good for business, Michael.<br> I mean, if Julia had one flagrant<br> affair after another, nobody would notice<br> but--but this boy,<br> he's half her age.<br> the public has always looked up to you<br> as such a devoted and loyal couple.<br> and so we are, damn it. in our way.<br> devoted, united, but not...<br> how shall I put it? not possessive.<br> we're a very modern couple.<br> hello, Roger, my boy.<br> hello, daddy.<br> glad to be finished at Eton?<br> no mummy?<br> no, it's Saturday. she's got 2 shows.<br> she'll be down first<br> thing in the morning.<br> thank you so much.<br> thank you, sir.<br> here, let me give you a hand.<br> she's bringing a young<br> chap down with her,<br> your age more or less.<br> a yank. I think you'll like him.<br> I get no kick from champagne<br> mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all<br> so tell me why should it be true<br> that I get a kick out of you<br> what's the matter?<br> nothing.<br> tell me.<br> it's...
