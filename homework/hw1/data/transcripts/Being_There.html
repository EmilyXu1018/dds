                        I dare you to stop me<br> in my Super Cop Clobberer.<br> Anybody who'd try to stop him<br> has to be totally stupid.<br> Stupid? Hey, Mumbly, come back.<br> And make it snappy.<br> ...snow that fell over the whole weekend,<br> and the blizzard is one of the worst...<br> ...as you can see,<br> one of the worst in that city's history.<br> They have not been lucky in the Midwest,<br> as soon as they dig out...<br> ...another storm hits and there's one<br> out West that might be in soon.<br> We've been very lucky, though.<br> Every time it snows-<br> - Your friend's out here.<br> - Friends? I have no friends.<br> Big Bird, we came to see you drive.<br> It's a little too late now, isn't it?<br> Good morning, Louise.<br> He's dead, Chance.<br> The old man's dead.<br> I see.<br> He wasn't breathing...<br> ...and he's cold as a fish.<br> I touched him, just to see.<br> Chance?<br> Then I...<br> .. covered him up...<br> pulled a sheet over his head.<br> Oh, Lord!<br> What a morning.<br> Yes, Louise.<br> It looks like it's going to snow.<br> Have you seen the garden?<br> - It feels just like it's going to snow-<br> - Damn it, boy.<br> Is that all you've got to say?<br> That old man is lying up there<br> dead as hell...<br> ...and it just don't make<br> any difference to you.<br> Lord, Chance...<br> I'm sorry for yelling like I did.<br> No, sir. I just don't know<br> what I was expecting.<br> I suppose I better gather you up<br> some breakfast.<br> Yes, please. I'm very hungry, Louise.<br> I'll make you some eggs.<br> There're lots of animals in the barnyard.<br> Want to go with the rooster to see them?<br> "Sealy Posturepedic morning"<br> Feeling so good it shows.<br> Because Posturepedic is designed...<br> ...in cooperation with leading orthopedic<br> surgeons for no morning backache...<br> ...from sleeping on a too-soft mattress.<br> "It's a Sealy Posturepedic morning"<br> - Keep in the shade, Alvin.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> I won't have the horses<br> standing in the sun.

I'm Chance, the gardener.<br> - The gardener?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.<br> Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts.<br> The law firm handling the estate.<br> Yes, Thomas, I understand.<br> Are you waiting for someone?<br> An appointment?<br> Yes. Louise will bring me my lunch.<br> All kidding aside, Mr. Chance,<br> may I ask just what you're doing here?<br> I live here.<br> There is no mention of a gardener.<br> According to our inventories, there hasn't<br> been a man employed here since 1933.<br> Except for a Mr. Joe Saracini...<br> ...a brick mason,<br> who did some repairs to a wall.<br> He was here for two and a half days<br> in 1952.<br> Yes. I remember Joe.<br> He was very fat, had short hair...<br> ...and showed me pictures<br> from a funny little book.<br> - Some pictures?<br> - Yes.<br> Of men and women.<br> Just how long have you been living here,<br> Mr. Chance?<br> Ever since I can remember.<br> Ever since I was a child<br> I've worked in this garden.<br> Then you really are a gardener?<br> My roses.<br> We will need some proof<br> of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.<br> You have me, I'm here.<br> That's where Joe fixed the wall.<br> Are you related to the deceased?<br> I don't think so.<br> That's a nice car.<br> Do you drive it, Mr. Chance?<br> I've never been in an automobile.<br> You've never been in a car?<br> No.<br> I've never been allowed<br> outside of the house.<br> You can call me Ray,<br> or you can call me Jay...<br> I used to listen to the radio.<br> Then the old man started giving me<br> television sets.<br> This one has a remote control.<br> Maybe there's another<br> gum machine someplace.<br> You see? This is my bed.<br> This is my bathroom.<br> This is my sink.<br> This is my toilet.<br> This is my bathtub.<br> Here is my closet.<br> You have a very handsome wardrobe.<br> Yes.<br> I'm allowed to go to the attic<br> and wear any of the old man's clothes.<br> - They fit me very well, don't they?<br> - Yes.<br> It's amazing how those clothes<br> have come back into style.<br> Why is the bed like this?<br> I like to sleep with my head<br> facing the north.<br> I sleep better that way.<br> Yes, I've heard about that. Could you<br> show us something with your address?<br> But this is facing west.<br> - What is facing west?<br> - The bed.<br> I see.<br> Mr. Chance, I'd like to know<br> what sort of claim...<br> ...you're planning to make<br> against the deceased's estate.<br> The garden is a healthy one, Thomas.<br> I have no claim.<br> I see. Would you be willing<br> to sign a paper to that effect?<br> I don't know how to sign, Thomas.<br> Very well, Mr. Chance,<br> I have no alternative but to inform you...<br> ...that this house is now closed.<br> If, indeed, you have resided here,<br> you have no legal right to remain.<br> You'll have to move out by,<br> let's say, noon tomorrow.<br> I don't understand "move out. "<br> Call me, or have your attorney call me...<br> ...if you change your mind about signing.<br> Come on, Sally, let's grab a bite.<br> What about medical records?<br> Could you give us the name<br> of your doctor or your dentist?<br> I have no doctor or dentist.<br> I see.<br> Good day, Mr. Chance.<br> Good day, Sally. Good day, Thomas.<br> Every day you're doing new things,<br> and you need the Washington Post to help.<br> Pardon me for intruding at a time like this,<br> but were you very close to Max?<br> Are you kidding? We were inseparable.<br> Jogger's knee and swimmer's...<br> We have tennis elbow, jogger's knee,<br> and simmer's...<br> And swimmer's what?<br> I'm sorry. All I can think of is trunks.<br> Jim's back was broken in three places,<br> his skull was fractured...<br> ...and his chest crushed. He's a paraplegic.<br> But after a year in the hospital,<br> he went back to school...<br> ...got his master's degree<br> and now looks to the future.<br> I get depressed, you know,<br> this kind of thing...<br> ...and it's momentary,<br> it usually hits at night.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm very hungry.<br> Could you give me some lunch?<br> It's an all-girl show, sir.<br> it's an all-girl show.<br> Come right in. it's an all-girl show.<br> Excuse me.<br> Could you please tell me<br> where I could find a garden to work in?<br> A garden? What are you growing, man?<br> There is much to be done<br> during the winter.<br> I should start the seeds for the spring<br> and work the soil.<br> Bullshit!<br> Who sent you here, boy?<br> Did that chicken-shit asshole Raphael<br> send you, boy?<br> No.<br> Mr. Thomas Franklin told me<br> I must leave the old man's house.<br> - He's dead, you know.<br> - Dead, my ass.<br> You tell that asshole,<br> if he got something to tell me...<br> ...to get his ass down here himself.<br> Got that, boy?<br> TV changer, man.<br> What you got?<br> Now move, honky,<br> before I cut your white ass.<br> If I see Raphael,<br> I will give him your message.<br> - Do that.<br> - Good day.<br> Excuse me. That tree is very sick.<br> It needs care.<br> Yes, sir. I'll report it right away.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good day, sir.<br> - Good day.<br> W-4.<br> - I'm very sorry, sir, I didn't see you.<br> - Can't move. My leg.<br> This is terrible, sir.<br> I hope you're not badly injured.<br> No. I'm not badly injured.<br> But my leg is very sore.<br> - it's not broken, is it? Can you walk?<br> - I hope not.<br> - Perhaps I should call an ambulance.<br> - Let's have a look. Do you mind?<br> - No. I'd like to look.<br> - What's happened?<br> My goodness, your leg!<br> Yes.<br> It should be examined.<br> We could take you to a hospital.<br> - There's no need for the hospital.<br> - A doctor should look at that.<br> I insist. We'll take him to a hospital.<br> I'm very sorry, Mrs. Rand.<br> I never saw the man.<br> - it's really no one's fault, David.<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> I've never ridden in an automobile before.<br> I assure you, sir,<br> David is a very careful driver.<br> - I understand.<br> - Very good.<br> These situations can be so trying.<br> Everyone seems to make such a to-do<br> out of a simple little accident.<br> Is your leg feeling any better?<br> No, it isn't.<br> I see.<br> This is just like television,<br> only you can see much further.<br> Why don't you come to our house<br> and we could take care of you there?<br> Your house?<br> My husband's been very ill. The doctor<br> and the nurses are staying with us.<br> Hospitals can be so impersonal.<br> - I agree.<br> - Fine.<br> That'll save a lot of unnecessary fuss and<br> it'll be that much more pleasant for you.<br> We'll go right on home.<br> And, Jeffery, please call<br> and tell them we're on our way.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Would you care for a drink?<br> Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.<br> Thank you. May I watch television, please?<br> Why, yes. Certainly.<br> And now, the piece of resistance...<br> May I ask your name?<br> Chance.<br> Chance?<br> Chance, the gardener.<br> Chauncey Gardiner?<br> Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.<br> Are you related to Basil<br> and Perdita Gardiner?<br> No, I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.<br> They are such a wonderful couple.<br> My husband and I<br> are very good friends of theirs.<br> We often visit their island.<br> Thank you.<br> Did you lose something?<br> Yes, I lost my remote control.<br> I use it to change the channels.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You Wouldn't think of driving<br> without your rear-View mirror...<br> ...and yet some people still drive<br> without a fuzz buster.<br> When they unwrapped the chopsticks<br> to be used by the Chinese guests...<br> ...the packages were clearly stamped<br> "Made in Taiwan. "<br> I know it's important to stay informed<br> of all the latest events, but...<br> ...I find there's so much to assimilate<br> it can become quite muddling.<br> Until they placed the chopsticks around<br> the table. If the Chinese were upset-<br> Good evening, ma'am.<br> Wilson, will you take Mr. Gardiner<br> to the third-floor guest suite?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I'll see you after Dr. Allenby<br> has a look at your leg.<br> Thank you. Yes.<br> I've never been in one of these before.<br> It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill.<br> I see.<br> Does it have a television?<br> No. But Mr. Rand does have one<br> with an electric motor.<br> That way, he can get around by himself.<br> How long do we stay in here?<br> How long?<br> I don't know.<br> We'll see what the doctor says.<br> I've seen it done before,<br> in a film on television.<br> This won't hurt at all.<br> It did hurt.<br> There's no apparent damage to the bone.<br> But to be sure, we'll do an X-ray.<br> X- ray?<br> By the way, Mr. Gardiner,<br> I'd like to ask you something straight out.<br> - Straight out?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Are you planning on making<br> any sort of claim against the Rands?<br> Claim.<br> That's what Thomas asked me.<br> Thomas?<br> You can pull your trousers up now.<br> Who's Thomas?<br> Thomas Franklin. He's an attorney.<br> - An attorney?<br> - Yes.<br> Then you wish to handle this matter<br> through your attorneys?<br> There's no need for a claim.<br> I don't even know what they look like.<br> Well, then.<br> You caught me off guard there,<br> I must admit.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, the only thing we have<br> to look out for is minor hemorrhaging...<br> ...which isn't serious,<br> but could cause trouble later on.<br> Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...<br> ...would it be possible for you<br> to stay here for a day or two...<br> ...so we could keep an eye on it?<br> Yes, I could stay here.<br> - Does this house have a garden?<br> - Why, yes. Many.<br> Good.<br> Keep your weight off that leg,<br> Mr. Gardiner.<br> Mr. Wilson, wheel Mr. Gardiner in<br> for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> - Thank you.<br> Ever watch a game on TV and see<br> the players chugging down this stuff?<br> Ever wonder why?<br> I miss you so when I'm out.<br> How're you feeling?<br> No headaches?<br> No, it's been a fairly good day.<br> - Better than yours, so I've been told.<br> - You heard about it?<br> I may be a shut-in, but...<br> I'm sorry you had to go through all that.<br> It was nothing, really.<br> It just sounded worse than it was.<br> And Mr. Gardiner is a very reasonable man.<br> Reasonable...<br> I'd like to meet a reasonable man<br> for a change.<br> Why don't you ask this Robinson<br> for dinner?<br> Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.<br> Chauncey Gardiner.<br> Gardiner.<br> You think you're well enough<br> for dinner, Ben?<br> Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'll have them set another place.<br> My God, Eve, you'll freeze.<br> No. I just...<br> I just wanted to get some fresh air.<br> How's Mr. Gardiner?<br> Doesn't seem to be too serious.<br> But it's a rather large contusion<br> and I'd like to keep an eye on him...<br> ...so I suggested that he stay here<br> for a couple of days.<br> Here?<br> Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?<br> Is that necessary?<br> Not necessary, but helpful.<br> Don't worry,<br> he might be a breath of fresh air.<br> He is different, isn't he?<br> You know, he's very...<br> ...intense.<br> Perhaps.<br> Actually, I found him to have<br> quite a sense of humor.<br> That's a very small room.<br> Yes, sir, I guess that's true.<br> Smallest room in the house.<br> Yes, I guess that's true.<br> Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Can I help you to the table, Mr. Gardiner?<br> Thank you.<br> I feel very good in here.<br> That's the oxygen.<br> When I first got sick...<br> ...I had this entire room glassed in...<br> ...so they could pump in<br> some extra oxygen.<br> Keeps my spirits up.<br> You must be very ill.<br> Aplastic anemia.<br> The bone marrow doesn't supply<br> enough red blood cells.<br> Not a damn thing they can do about it.<br> They can keep me comfortable.<br> Prolong my life with steroid therapy...<br> ...and these transfusions.<br> But what makes my blood boil...<br> ...that is, what there is of it...<br> ...is that this is usually...<br> ...a young person's disease.<br> Here I am getting along in years...<br> ...and I'm about to die<br> of a young person's disease.<br> I've never seen anything like this<br> on television.<br> Please, lie still, Mr. Gardiner.<br> You'll join us for dinner, of course.<br> Yes, please. Thank you.<br> I'm very hungry.<br> Yes, so am I, my boy.<br> So am I.<br> Do you know Raphael?<br> No, sir. I don't believe I do.<br> Because I have a message for him.<br> Yes, sir?<br> A small black man<br> gave me a message for Raphael.<br> I still don't believe I know the man,<br> Mr. Gardiner. Now, please...<br> ...lie still.<br> Is there anyone we could notify for you?<br> No.<br> The old man died and Louise left.<br> I'm very sorry.<br> I do hope your injury won't prevent you<br> from attending to business.<br> Do you need a secretary?<br> No, thank you.<br> My house was shut down.<br> You mean your business was shut down?<br> Yes.<br> Shut down and closed by the attorneys.<br> What did I tell you?<br> That's exactly what I mean.<br> The businessman today is at the mercy<br> of kid lawyers from the SEC.<br> It's happening to everyone, I'm afraid.<br> The way things are going, they'll probably<br> legislate the medical profession...<br> ...right out of existence.<br> Yes. Right out of existence.<br> Yeah, it's a damn shame.<br> What are your plans now, Mr. Gardiner?<br> Or may I call you Chauncey?<br> Chauncey's fine.<br> So then, what are your plans, Chauncey?<br> I know exactly what he means.<br> isn't it wonderful...<br> ...to be with the trees<br> and the flowers like that?<br> I never had much feel for it, myself.<br> I'm a very good gardener.<br> It's such a pleasant way<br> to forget one's troubles.<br> Isn't that what any businessman is?<br> A gardener.<br> He...<br> ...works on...<br> ...flinty soil...<br> ...to make it productive...<br> ...with the labor of his own hands.<br> He waters it...<br> ...with the sweat of his own brow.<br> He makes a thing of value for his family...<br> ...and for the community.<br> Yes, indeed, Chauncey,<br> a productive businessman...<br> ...is a laborer in the vineyard.<br> I know exactly what you mean.<br> The garden that I left was such a place.<br> I don't have that any more. All I have left...<br> ...is the room upstairs.<br> Come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.<br> You've got your health.<br> For God's sake, man, you can't let those<br> bastards get you down. You've got to fight.<br> I don't want to hear any more from you<br> about that room upstairs.<br> That's where I'm going, too damn soon.<br> It's a very pleasant room, Ben.<br> I'm sure it is.<br> That's what they say, anyway.<br> You know...<br> ...there are thousands of businessmen,<br> large and small...<br> ...in your situation.<br> I've...<br> ...given the matter a good deal<br> of consideration for some time.<br> They've been harassed long enough by...<br> ...inflation, increased taxation...<br> ...all sorts of indecencies.<br> After all, they're our strongest defense<br> against the pollutants...<br> ...of our basic freedoms...<br> ...as well as the well-being<br> of our middle class.<br> I've been thinking about starting<br> a financial assistance fund.<br> Tell me, would you have any ideas<br> on that subject?<br> No, Ben.<br> Reluctant to speak, eh?<br> I can understand that.<br> After a man's lost everything...<br> ...anger tends to block out rationality,<br> for a while.<br> But, you work on the idea.<br> Water it.<br> Fertilize it.<br> I will, Ben. Yes.<br> I'm sure you'll sprout some thoughts<br> in a few days.<br> I will, Ben. Yes.<br> Sorry, sir.<br> I thought you were going to come out with<br> another jest about the elevator.<br> Excuse me.<br> Elevator.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Elevator.<br> I just wanted you to know<br> how delighted I am...<br> ...that you're staying with us<br> and how dreadful I feel about your leg.<br> Thank you, Eve.<br> You lifted Ben's spirits tonight<br> to such an extent, do you know that?<br> He liked you so much. He really did.<br> Ben is very ill, Eve. I've seen that before.<br> I know.<br> He reminds me of the old man.<br> Does he?<br> Are you going to leave and close<br> this house when Ben dies?<br> Why, I don't think so.<br> Goodnight, Eve.<br> Goodnight, Chauncey.<br> - 'Morning, Mr. Perkins.<br> - 'Morning, Mr. Riff.<br> - Nice to see you.<br> - Thanks.<br> We have an additional guest with us today,<br> Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.<br> I see. Shall we set up the communications<br> in the usual place?<br> - Of course.<br> - Okay, let's go to work.<br> Would you like a car, sir?<br> Yes, I would like a car.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Send up number seven, please.<br> Chauncey, there you are.<br> What are you doing on that leg?<br> It's fine today, Robert.<br> Shame on you.<br> Let me be the judge of that.<br> Please, sit in the chair.<br> I swear, between you and Benjamin,<br> I've got my hands full.<br> Say, that is coming along.<br> The swelling's gone down considerably.<br> Your limousine, sir.<br> Fine. Thank you.<br> Are you going somewhere?<br> No.<br> Anyway, the President's volunteered<br> to sit in for Ben at the convention.<br> Quite a nice gesture.<br> They're due here soon, I believe.<br> I know about the President coming.<br> - You do, do you?<br> - Yes.<br> Ben would like me to meet the President.<br> - He would, would he?<br> - Yes.<br> How will I know when it's 10:00?<br> It's 9:10, now.<br> And if you don't see a clock...<br> ...I'm sure someone will have the time.<br> I understand.<br> I'm going to walk.<br> Walk? Well, yes, hell yes. Walk.<br> - You're meeting the President, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> I've watched him on television.<br> It's very precise, sir.<br> It's 10:00.<br> Thank you, Jim.<br> Mrs. Aubrey, the President is arriving.<br> - Up and around this morning, are you?<br> - I like to walk, Ben.<br> That's good news, my boy.<br> You look much better today.<br> It's all make-up.<br> I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.<br> I didn't want the President to think<br> I would die while he was talking to me.<br> I see.<br> Nobody likes a dying man.<br> Because nobody knows what death is.<br> You seem to be an exception.<br> That's one of the things I admire<br> about you, your admirable balance.<br> You seem to be a truly peaceful man.<br> Thank you, Ben. Thank you.<br> Nurse Teresa did a very good job there.<br> Mr. Rand, the President is arriving.<br> Just show the President into the library.<br> We'll be along in a few minutes.<br> An old habit that goes along with power:<br> Keep them waiting.<br> Not now, Arthur.<br> But, sir...<br> I'm going to meet the President...<br> ...on my own two feet.<br> Shall we go?<br> That's a very good idea.<br> When I was younger,<br> I had thoughts of public office.<br> But I found that...<br> ...I was able to contribute more<br> as a private citizen.<br> Of course, my...<br> ...wealth provided me<br> with considerable influence.<br> But I've tried, believe me, I've tried...<br> ...not to misuse that power.<br> It's extremely important<br> that we don't allow ourselves...<br> ...to become blinded to the needs<br> of our government...<br> ...no matter how strong the temptation.<br> I've been labeled a kingmaker...<br> ...but I've tried...<br> ...to keep myself open<br> to the voice of the people.<br> And I've remained honest to myself.<br> That's the main thing.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Rand.<br> - Good morning, gentlemen.<br> Where the hell is he?<br> Mr. President.<br> Ben.<br> It's good to see you. You look terrific.<br> Thank you, Mr. President.<br> Your visit has helped to raise my spirits.<br> I've missed you, my friend.<br> Come, sit down. Take a load off your feet.<br> Hello, Mr. President.<br> Hello.<br> I want you to meet my very dear friend,<br> Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.<br> On television, Mr. President,<br> you look much smaller.<br> I must warn you,<br> Chauncey's not a man to bandy words.<br> Oh? Really?<br> Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man<br> who appreciates a frank discussion.<br> - Would you be seated?<br> - Yes, I will.<br> - Ben, I was wondering if you had a chance-<br> - Yes?<br> - Did you happen to have a chance to go-<br> - Yes?<br> Ben, did you read my speech?<br> Overall, pretty good.<br> But I think, Mr. President,<br> that it is very dangerous...<br> ...to play around with temporary measures<br> at a time like this.<br> Ben, I mean...<br> I sympathize with you...<br> ...and I know how difficult it is<br> to be straightforward.<br> But I'll tell you right now, Bobby...<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi. I'm Riff. Secret Service.<br> Good. Of course.<br> What you're saying, Ben, is that...<br> - ... you don't think I should take the chance.<br> - Absolutely not.<br> Do you agree with Ben, or do you think<br> we can stimulate growth through...<br> ...temporary incentives?<br> As long as the roots are not severed...<br> ...all is well.<br> And all will be well...<br> ...in the garden.<br> - In the garden?<br> - Yes.<br> In a garden, growth has its season.<br> First comes spring and summer...<br> ...but then we have...<br> ...fall and winter.<br> And then we get spring and summer again.<br> - Spring and summer?<br> - Yes.<br> - And fall and winter?<br> - Yes.<br> I think what our insightful<br> young friend is saying...<br> ...is that we welcome the inevitable...<br> ...seasons of nature...<br> ...but we're upset by the seasons<br> of our economy.<br> Yes.<br> There will be growth in the spring.<br> I must admit, that is one of the most<br> refreshing and optimistic statements...<br> ...I've heard in a very long time.<br> I admire your good, solid sense.<br> That's precisely what we lack<br> on Capitol Hill.<br> I must be going.<br> - This visit has been most enlightening.<br> - Yes, it has.<br> And Ben, thank you<br> for your time and thought.<br> Oh, nonsense.<br> Thank you for taking time out<br> with a dying man.<br> No, I won't have any of that.<br> Why don't you listen<br> to your friend Chauncey?<br> This is a time to think of life.<br> That's right, Mr. President.<br> Now, you take care, Ben.<br> And you take care, too, Bobby.<br> Chauncey.<br> Bobby.<br> He's a decent fellow, isn't he,<br> the President?<br> Yes. I'm glad he came.<br> Kaufman, I'll need some information<br> on Chauncey Gardiner's background.<br> - Gardiner, yes, sir.<br> - And I'd like it sometime today.<br> No problem, chief.<br> You know...<br> ...you don't play games with words...<br> ...to protect yourself.<br> No, you're direct.<br> Do you remember what I was talking<br> to you about last night?<br> - No.<br> - Sure you do.<br> My plan for financial assistance<br> to businessmen.<br> I think you're just the man to take charge<br> of an institution like that.<br> I understand.<br> I know you're not a man<br> to act on the spur of the moment...<br> ...so don't feel that you have to rush<br> into a decision.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, I'm afraid I must excuse myself.<br> I'm awfully tired.<br> I'm sorry you're so sick.<br> We have 60,000 tulip bulbs up there.<br> It is so glorious when they bloom.<br> Of course, the roses are my favorites.<br> We have 20,000 rose bushes.<br> And over here,<br> we plant something different every year.<br> I haven't quite decided<br> what we'll plant this year.<br> And that's the gardener's house.<br> And this is the greenhouse.<br> I like to watch the young plants grow.<br> - it's wonderful, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> Young plants do much better<br> if a person helps them.<br> You know...<br> ...Ben told me that the President<br> was very taken with you this morning.<br> Last night you mentioned<br> an old man that died.<br> You must've been very close to him.<br> I was. Yes.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You mentioned also<br> that Louise had gone, also.<br> Were you very close to Louise?<br> Yes, I liked Louise very much.<br> She was his maid.<br> - Oh, his maid.<br> - Yes.<br> I see.<br> So stupid of me. I thought maybe<br> she was perhaps someone...<br> ...you were romantically involved with<br> or maybe a sister.<br> No.<br> She used to bring me my meals.<br> She was very kind to me.<br> Chauncey Gardiner, Mr. Rand's friend and<br> advisor, was at the meeting this morning.<br> I found Mr. Gardiner to have a feeling<br> for this country that we need more of<br> To quote Mr. Gardiner,<br> a most intuitive man:<br> "As long as the roots of industry remain<br> firmly planted in the national soil...<br> "... the economic prospects<br> are undoubtedly sunny. "<br> - What is it?<br> - Doctor.<br> Decoral. Five milligrams.<br> Now, I know that many of you...<br> Put your arms up.<br> I think you'd better leave, Eve.<br> - Will he be okay?<br> - He'll be fine.<br> Yeah, we got you, Ben.<br> Come on, Chauncey.<br> But I have decided<br> there are no temporary stopgaps.<br> So I'm going to rethink my position<br> and find another solution.<br> You'll be very pleased to know that your...<br> ...founder and Chairman of the Board...<br> ...Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand,<br> agrees with me on this...<br> ...for once.<br> Gentlemen, let us not fear the inevitable<br> chill and storms of autumn and winter.<br> Instead, let us anticipate<br> the rapid growth of springtime.<br> Let us await the rewards of summer.<br> As in a garden of the earth,<br> let us learn to accept...<br> ...and appreciate the times<br> when the trees are bare...<br> ...as well as the times<br> when we pick the fruit.<br> I'm just so very grateful<br> that you're here with us.<br> So am I, Eve.<br> It's been an exhausting day for Ben.<br> He's resting now,<br> and there's no cause for alarm.<br> I have a telephone call for you.<br> Telephone call?<br> Yes. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor<br> of the Washington Post.<br> Would you care to take it, sir?<br> Yes.<br> In my office.<br> Go, I'll be just fine.<br> Yes, you'll be fine.<br> He's such a kind and sensitive man.<br> Don't you think?<br> - He's not there.<br> - Not there?<br> Mr. Courtney, are you there?<br> Yes, he's there.<br> Where is he? There or here?<br> He's on both lines.<br> Are you there?<br> Yes, I'm here.<br> Hello, Mr. Gardiner.<br> I saw the President's speech<br> at the Financial Institute today.<br> Would you care to comment...<br> ...on the meeting between Mr. Rand<br> and the President and yourself?<br> Yes. It was very nice meeting...<br> ...the President.<br> What we'd like to know are some facts.<br> Such as, what is the exact relationship<br> between yourself and the...<br> ...First American Financial Corporation?<br> I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.<br> Well, yes, sir. But Mr. Rand is ill,<br> so I'm taking the liberty of asking you.<br> What? Say that again.<br> I said that since Mr. Rand is ill,<br> I'm taking the liberty of asking you.<br> Yes, you are.<br> You should ask Mr. Rand that.<br> Of course.<br> Just one quick question, Mr. Gardiner-<br> Will you hold a minute, please?<br> I have the producer<br> of The Gary Burns Show on the line.<br> Yes, I have watched that show.<br> Of course. They would like you to appear<br> on the show tonight.<br> The Vice President was scheduled,<br> but he had to cancel.<br> They asked if you would be interested.<br> Yes. I've been on television.<br> Fine.<br> Hello, Mr. Hull?<br> Mr. Gardiner has agreed to do the show.<br> He's been on television.<br> Yes. The show will be taped,<br> and then shown at 10:00...<br> ...but he's to be there...<br> What do you mean, he's got<br> no background? That's impossible.<br> I quoted the man on national television.<br> He's a very well-known man.<br> We're well aware of that, sir-<br> He's a close friend and advisor<br> of Benjamin Rand.<br> For Christ's sakes,<br> we've got volumes of data on Rand.<br> I plan to contact Mr. Rand the minute-<br> I do not want Ben disturbed.<br> We have other ways of gathering<br> information than to trouble a dying man.<br> la detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner.<br> Have it in my office, tomorrow at 7:00.<br> - I've got to take a leak.<br> - Right, chief.<br> Of course, your position in the financial<br> community carries a lot of weight.<br> But what caught Gary's interest<br> was your down-to-earth philosophy.<br> I see.<br> Do you realize more people<br> will be watching you tonight...<br> ...than all those that have seen<br> theater plays in the last 40 years?<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes.<br> Why?<br> Hell, I don't know.<br> Good.<br> - This way.<br> - Thank you.<br> Gardiner's laconic.<br> He plays his cards very close to the chest...<br> ...and the scuttlebutt is<br> he's a strong candidate for a seat...<br> ...on the board of First American Financial.<br> Kinney, what have you found<br> on his background?<br> Nothing.<br> Yeah, skip the levity.<br> I know it's ridiculous,<br> but there is no information about Gardiner.<br> We have no material on him.<br> Zilch.<br> Here. I want your shoulders to go<br> right on this pad.<br> Now, wait, you have to put your head<br> through the hole first.<br> Head in the hole.<br> That's right. Okay. Stretch your legs out,<br> push your body...<br> Thought you might need this about now.<br> It gets pretty hot underneath these lights.<br> Thank you. I'm very thirsty.<br> If Gary wants to interrupt you,<br> or ask you a question...<br> ...he'll lift his left forefinger<br> to his left eyebrow. All right?<br> - I understand.<br> - Good.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're very welcome.<br> - Nurse Teresa did Ben's make-up.<br> - Really?<br> - Did she do a good job?<br> - Yes, it looked just like this.<br> - Looks like you're up.<br> - I am?<br> - Gary's ready for you now.<br> - Yes.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Good luck.<br> This way.<br> How very nice to have you<br> with us this evening, Mr. Gardiner.<br> Hello, Gary.<br> This is Miss Annie Lawson.<br> Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.<br> - Hi. How do you do?<br> - Hello.<br> ld like very much to thank you<br> for joining us on such short notice.<br> ...and filling in for the Vice President.<br> Yes.<br> It's always somewhat surprising<br> to find men like yourself..<br> ...working so intimately<br> with the President, and yet...<br> ...somehow managing to remain<br> relatively unknown.<br> Yes, it is surprising.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Your anonymity is certainty likely<br> to be a thing of the past from now on.<br> Good.<br> I assume, since the President quoted you...<br> ...that you're inclined to agree<br> with his view of the economy.<br> Which view?<br> The President compared the economy<br> of this country to a garden and he stated...<br> ...that after a period of decline,<br> a time of growth would naturally follow.<br> Yes.<br> It is possible...<br> ...for everything...<br> ...to grow strong.<br> And there is plenty of room...<br> ...for new trees and new flowers...<br> ...of all kinds.<br> So, you're saying...<br> ...this is just another<br> season in the garden, so to speak.<br> Yes.<br> A garden needs a lot of care<br> and a lot of love.<br> And if you give your garden...<br> ...a lot of love, things grow.<br> But first, some things must wither.<br> Some trees die...<br> - it's that gardener.<br> - Yeah. Chauncey Gardiner.<br> No, he's a real gardener.<br> He does talk like one.<br> But I think he's brilliant.<br> That is very interesting indeed,<br> but what about the bad seasons?<br> Doesn't a country need<br> to have someone in charge...<br> ...who can see it through<br> these periods of crisis?<br> A leader, capable of guiding us through<br> the bad seasons, as well as the good?<br> - Yes.<br> - That bastard means it.<br> Oh, yes.<br> We need a very good gardener.<br> And I do agree with the President...<br> ...that the garden needs a lot of care.<br> It is a good garden.<br> Its trees are healthy-<br> for you to answer, but...<br> ...do you feel that we have...<br> ...in your words,<br> a very good gardener in office...<br> ...at this time?<br> Jesus!<br> Yes, some plants...<br> ...do well in the sun...<br> ...and others grow better in the shade.<br> Sounds as if we need<br> a lot of gardening here.<br> We certainly do.<br> It's for sure a white man's world<br> in America.<br> I raised that boy<br> since he was the size of a piss ant...<br> ...and I'll say right now he never learned<br> to read and write.<br> No, sir.<br> He had no brains at all.<br> Stuffed with rice pudding<br> between the ears.<br> Short-changed by the Lord<br> and dumb as a jackass.<br> Look at him now.<br> Yes, sir, all you got to be<br> is white in America...<br> ...to get whatever you want.<br> Gobbledygook!<br> What sort of gardener would you be,<br> Mr. Gardiner?<br> - I am a very serious gardener.<br> - I'm sure you are, Mr. Gardiner.<br> Remarkable.<br> You're fond of him, too, aren't you?<br> That's good.<br> That's good.<br> May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?<br> Bravo, sir. Outstanding!<br> Okay, Sally, I'll see you in 20 minutes.<br> Okay.<br> I won't belong. I've just got to talk to her<br> about this gardener.<br> Goodnight.<br> - Look, Johanna-<br> - I said, goodnight.<br> Tomorrow night...<br> ...Senator Rowley's widow...<br> ...is holding a reception<br> for the Soviet ambassador.<br> It's pretty obvious that Robert here<br> is not going to allow me to attend.<br> So, you'd be doing me a great favor...<br> ...if you would attend in my place,<br> and escort Eve.<br> Yes, Ben.<br> I would love to escort Eve.<br> You and Eve should create quite a stir.<br> I can already hear the gossip.<br> You have the gift of being natural.<br> That's a great talent, my boy.<br> I hope the entire country was listening.<br> The entire country.<br> Darling, what's wrong?<br> I can't.<br> I just can't, right now.<br> I'm sorry, dearest. I just...<br> I just can't.<br> We'll fix up one of Ben's for you.<br> Sophie insists on black tie.<br> I see.<br> - Chauncey?<br> - Yes?<br> I don't have very many friends.<br> And Ben's friends are...<br> ...quite a bit older than I am.<br> Quite a bit.<br> Goodnight.<br> Goodnight.<br> He was very clever, keeping it at a third<br> grade level, that's what they understand.<br> Yeah? I don't understand<br> why he was in Jennings' house.<br> What was up his sleeve<br> when he pulled that stunt with us?<br> What was he doing? And why?<br> Who knows? Maybe the government<br> had something to do with it.<br> You know...<br> ...he made a fool out of me.<br> - And you know what that means?<br> - No.<br> Any political future I had<br> is right down the toilet.<br> Jesus, the thought of spending<br> the rest of my life as an attorney...<br> Well...<br> ...that is really a downer. And, Christ...<br> ...I almost forgot. Johanna is starting<br> to think something's going on.<br> Sid, be reasonable.<br> I have been everywhere.<br> - There is no place left to look.<br> - Try again.<br> Sure, try again. Where? There's nothing.<br> It's like Gardiner never existed.<br> Try again.<br> Sid, it's useless.<br> I said, try again.<br> Up yours. You try again. I quit.<br> - 'Morning, gentlemen.<br> - Good morning, Mr. President.<br> - We found no information...<br> - it's not what I requested.<br> ...before Mr. Gardiner appeared<br> at the Rands'.<br> This information goes back<br> a day and a half.<br> - I want the standard file, you know that.<br> - Right, chief.<br> Well, where is it?<br> Right, chief.<br> Kaufman, what the hell<br> are you talking about?<br> The Bureau has some data, sir,<br> but it's not pertinent.<br> - I'd like to hear that data.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> His suits...<br> ...were made by a New York tailor,<br> handmade...<br> ...in 1928.<br> The tailor went out of business<br> in 1933 and later...<br> ...took his own life.<br> His underwear, all of the finest cloth.<br> The factory was destroyed by fire in 1948.<br> This man carries no identification.<br> No driver's license, no wallet,<br> no credit cards.<br> Computers have analyzed his...<br> - Miss Davies.<br> - ... vocal characteristics.<br> I'd like my eggs poached<br> this morning, please.<br> But they cannot determine<br> his ethnic background.<br> Come in.<br> Have you read the newspapers?<br> I don't read papers.<br> You're described as one of the architects<br> of the President's speech last night.<br> And your comments on the television show<br> are quoted alongside the President's.<br> I like the President very much.<br> He's a nice man.<br> You're very nice, too.<br> Hi, neighbor.<br> There's somebody at the door.<br> Let's see who that special person is.<br> it's Mr. McFeeland.<br> You don't mind my being here like...<br> ...this?<br> No.<br> I like you to be here.<br> You do?<br> I'd like to sing about something<br> even more special.<br> And that something is you.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm so grateful.<br> I would've just...<br> ...opened up at the slightest touch.<br> I would've just opened up. You know?<br> You know that.<br> But you're so strong...<br> ...that I can trust myself with you.<br> I'm glad you didn't open.<br> A long time ago,<br> people didn't have television...<br> ...but they still liked to look<br> at interesting pictures.<br> And they would put pictures like these...<br> - Thank you.<br> - ... in a special viewer.<br> They would look at them very carefully.<br> lll show you another one.<br> They looked like cards.<br> Flash cards for schools or something.<br> But they're really photographs.<br> Take a careful look at them.<br> The interesting thing about them,<br> is that they're two.<br> One. Two.<br> And they look very much alike.<br> Here, I'll show you another one.<br> Mr. Thomas Franklin, please.<br> Is Mr. Franklin in?<br> Certainly. This is Dr. Robert Allenby.<br> Would you tell Mr. Franklin<br> that I'd like to speak to him?<br> It concerns Chauncey Gardiner.<br> What was your reaction to the Post's<br> editorial on the President's speech?<br> I did not read that.<br> - But, sir, you must've at least glanced at it.<br> - I did not glance at it.<br> The New York Times spoke<br> of your "peculiar brand of optimism. "<br> - What was your reaction to that?<br> - I do not know what it means.<br> Sorry to persist, sir,<br> but it would be of great interest to me...<br> ...to know just what newspapers<br> you do read.<br> I do not read papers. I watch TV.<br> Do you mean that you find<br> television's coverage of the news...<br> ...better than that of the newspapers?<br> I like to watch TV.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Few men in public life have the courage<br> not to read the newspapers.<br> None, that this reporter has met,<br> had the guts to admit it.<br> I've never seen anyone<br> handle the press the way you do.<br> You're so cool and detached.<br> Thank you.<br> - How are you?<br> - I'm fine. How are you?<br> I'm very well.<br> I'd like you to meet Chauncey Gardiner.<br> Hello, Vladimir.<br> And this is Mrs. Skrapinov.<br> - Natasha.<br> - Hello, Natasha.<br> - Very nice meeting you.<br> - And you.<br> You must sit with us, my friends.<br> We have much to discuss.<br> I agree.<br> Let's let the men talk.<br> Would you two excuse us for a moment?<br> Regretfully, we shall yield<br> the pleasure of your company to others.<br> I shall yield, too.<br> Yes. Well, you have a nice chat.<br> Shouldn't we get together more often<br> to exchange our thoughts?<br> It's strictly at the rumor stage now, Lyman.<br> - But there's something in the wind.<br> - Something rather big in the wind, I'd say.<br> So whose files were destroyed?<br> The CIA's or the FBI's?<br> I don't know.<br> You may find, my friend,<br> that we are not so far from each other.<br> Not so far.<br> We are not so far from each other.<br> Our chairs are almost touching.<br> Bravo.<br> Our chairs are indeed almost touching.<br> And we want to remain seated on them,<br> correct?<br> We don't want them snatched out<br> from under us, am I right?<br> Because, if one goes, the other goes.<br> And then boom-boom and boom-boom.<br> What is it about his background<br> that they're trying to cover up?<br> A criminal record? A membership<br> in a subversive organization?<br> Homosexual, perhaps.<br> He told me that he had been living there<br> since he was a child...<br> ...working as a gardener.<br> He showed us a room in the garage<br> where he said he stayed, and...<br> ...I didn't really believe him,<br> of course, but why the act?<br> Tell me...<br> ...do you, by any chance,<br> enjoy Krylov's fables?<br> Now, I ask you that<br> because there is something...<br> ...Krylovian about you.<br> Do you think so?<br> I believe that you know Krylov.<br> So, you know your Krylov in Russian,<br> do you?<br> I must confess,<br> I had suspected as much all along.<br> Excuse me, but would you tell me<br> your name again?<br> A dash of American humor.<br> Vladimir Skrapinov.<br> That's a very nice name.<br> And yours, Chauncey Gardiner.<br> He must have been involved<br> on some major financial level...<br> ...with the deceased.<br> - With who?<br> - Mr. Jennings.<br> But our firm has no record<br> of any such transactions.<br> You had the Russian ambassador eating<br> right out of your hand. You know that?<br> I didn't know you spoke Russian.<br> it's incredible.<br> It is extremely useful<br> to speak Russian today.<br> - Are you proficient in other languages?<br> - He's so modest, Ambassador Gaufridi.<br> He just never advertises<br> his accomplishments.<br> Maybe you should talk to somebody,<br> darling.<br> No.<br> No, that wouldn't do any good.<br> Hello, Ronald. How are you?<br> - Just fine.<br> - Good. I am fine, too.<br> - Good.<br> - Yes. We're fine.<br> Yeah, fine.<br> My editors and I have been wondering<br> if you'd consider writing a book for us.<br> Something about your political philosophy.<br> What do you say?<br> - I can't write.<br> - Of course not. Who can, nowadays?<br> I have trouble writing a postcard<br> to my children.<br> Look, we can give you a six-figure advance.<br> I'll provide you with the very best<br> ghost writer, proofreaders...<br> - I can't read.<br> - Of course, you can't.<br> No one has the time.<br> We glance at things, we watch television.<br> I like to watch TV.<br> I'm sure you do. No one reads.<br> He's very, very sexy.<br> Don't leave me alone with him for too long.<br> You say he showed you his garden.<br> He said it was his.<br> He walked us through it.<br> I see.<br> Mr. Franklin, I must ask you<br> and Ms. Hayes...<br> ...to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner<br> strictly to yourselves.<br> There's no telling<br> what he could have been involved in.<br> It could be<br> an extremely confidential matter.<br> - Please, not a word.<br> - Of course, Doctor. I understand.<br> Fine.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Certainly. Glad to be of help.<br> I heard he speaks eight languages.<br> And on top of everything else,<br> holds a degree in medicine as well as law.<br> Isn't that true, Eve?<br> I don't know, Senator,<br> but it wouldn't surprise me.<br> He's very attractive.<br> Isn't he?<br> You know, I've never met anyone like you<br> in Washington before.<br> Yes, I've been here all my life.<br> Really?<br> And where have you been all my life?<br> Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...<br> ...have you ever had sex with a man?<br> No. I don't think so.<br> We could go upstairs right now.<br> Is there a TV upstairs?<br> I like to watch.<br> You like to watch?<br> Yes.<br> You wait right here. I'll go get Warren.<br> Is it me?<br> - Is it something I've done?<br> - No, sweetheart, it's not...<br> No, it's...<br> it's not you.<br> This never happened<br> when you were a senator.<br> It's not that, it's just that I...<br> - Yeah, Kaufman, what is it?<br> - The CIA or the FBI...<br> - ... destroyed Gardiner's files.<br> - What? Why?<br> - Neither agency will admit to a thing.<br> - All right.<br> Get Baldwin and Honeycutt over here.<br> I'll be right down.<br> I feel so close to you.<br> I feel safe.<br> Ben understands my feelings for you,<br> by the way, and he accepts them.<br> Ben is very wise.<br> Or thirdly, the man's files<br> have been destroyed.<br> - Now, I'd like some answers.<br> - Gardiner's not a foreign agent.<br> There are now 16 countries<br> investigating the man.<br> I see.<br> What about the third question?<br> Is it possible to erase all traces of a man?<br> Highly unlikely, sir.<br> In fact, the boys around the Bureau feel...<br> ...that the only one<br> capable of pulling this off...<br> ...would be an ex-FBI man.<br> I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.<br> What do the boys around Intelligence feel?<br> Well, Mr. President,<br> they don't quite know...<br> it's very difficult...<br> ...for me to say goodnight to you.<br> It's very hard...<br> ...for me to leave you.<br> It's very hard for me, too.<br> No.<br> Sell all 750,000 shares...<br> ...of CCT.<br> Let's see.<br> Sell a million shares of Inland Oil.<br> Mrs. Aubrey...<br> ...have 30,000 shares of Standard...<br> ...transferred into your account.<br> That's for you.<br> I was just cleaning up some loose ends.<br> Getting rid of the dead wood...<br> ...so Eve wouldn't have to cope with it.<br> I'd like to talk to you about Chauncey.<br> You know...<br> ...there's something about him...<br> ...that I trust.<br> He makes me feel good.<br> Since he's been around...<br> ...the thought of dying...<br> ...has been much Easter for me.<br> I couldn't stand it.<br> What is it?<br> What's wrong?<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't know what you like. I'm sorry.<br> I like to watch.<br> What do you mean, you like to watch?<br> I like to watch.<br> You mean...<br> ...me, you like to watch me...<br> ...do it.<br> It's very good.<br> No, thanks. I never touch the stuff never.<br> A cigar, then?<br> I'll have one of those. Thanks.<br> Thanks very much.<br> - Sit down, Rico.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> Now listen, Rico...<br> ...I'm going to talk to you, but<br> you're not going to hear a word I say, see?<br> This is inside dope and if it gets out,<br> it'll be just too bad for somebody.<br> You know me.<br> All right. Get this.<br> Pete Montana's through.<br> - And I thought he was such a big guy.<br> - He's through.<br> Suppose I were to tell you that,<br> from now on, you were Pete Montana.<br> That you were to take over his territory<br> in addition to your own.<br> Will you shake on it?<br> One of the first things you should know<br> about me, my darling...<br> ...is that I'm a little shy.<br> All right, it's set.<br> I'm doing a lot for you, Rico.<br> When I get you planted...<br> - ... I'll expect plenty of service.<br> - You'll sure get it.<br> Permit me, then, to drink to the new boss<br> of the North Side.<br> Thank you.<br> You look great, boss.<br> Feels terrible.<br> There ain't none of us ever been<br> invited up to eat at the Big Boy's dump.<br> And nobody ever crashed the gate<br> except Pete Montana.<br> If you think I'm going out in this harness,<br> you're crazy.<br> You look fine, boss.<br> - Hello, Big Boy.<br> - Hello, Rico.<br> Wow, you're rather lit up tonight,<br> aren't you?<br> This next exercise is trying to...<br> ...sort of explore and with any explorer,<br> go slowly.<br> Knee to the chest<br> and experimenting with the weight...<br> ...and going at this slowly.<br> Please, nobody leaping up.<br> Where did you go?<br> Don't be frightened of it. It's important<br> to know that, yes, you could roll over.<br> Tell her to come down.<br> I'm gonna put in a CVP line.<br> No.<br> No more shots.<br> No more.<br> It's not good.<br> I know.<br> You uncoil my wants...<br> ...desire flows within me.<br> And when you watch me, my passion...<br> ...it dissolves the desire.<br> You set me free.<br> And I reveal myself to myself<br> and I am drenched...<br> ...and purged.<br> Mr. Rand would like to see you.<br> I would like to see Ben.<br> Yes, Ben?<br> Are you going to die now?<br> I think I'm...<br> ...going to surrender the...<br> ...horn of plenty...<br> ...for the horn of Gabriel.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Let me feel your strength.<br> I hope that you'll stay here...<br> ...with Eve.<br> Take care of her.<br> She cares for you.<br> Watch...<br> ...over her.<br> She's a delicate flower.<br> A flower.<br> Yes.<br> There's...<br> ...so much left to do.<br> I've spoken to them, my associates.<br> They're eager...<br> ...very eager, to meet you.<br> Tell Eve...<br> He's gone.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I've seen this before.<br> It happens to old people.<br> Will you be leaving now?<br> Yes, in a day or two.<br> Yes.<br> Eve is staying.<br> She said she will not close up the house.<br> You've become quite a close friend<br> of Eve's, haven't you...<br> ...Chance?<br> Yes.<br> I love Eve very much.<br> And you really are a gardener, aren't you?<br> I am...<br> ...a gardener.<br> I'll go and tell Eve about Ben.<br> I understand.<br> I understand.<br> I know that Ben said,<br> "Keep it small and quiet. "<br> And I don't Want to go<br> against his Wishes...<br> ...but I thought it would be good,<br> while our friends are carrying Ben to his...<br> ...last resting place...<br> ...to read from his quotes.<br> "I have no use for those on welfare...<br> "... no patience whatsoever.<br> "But if I am to be honest with myself..<br> Must admit that they have<br> no use for me, either.<br> "I do not regret having political differences<br> with men that I respect.<br> "I do regret, however...<br> "... that our philosophies...<br> "... kept us apart. "<br> Yes, I agree. Except he's so boring.<br> What about Max?<br> - He could never take an election.<br> - Correct.<br> The people of this country<br> need to be awakened.<br> What about Lawson?<br> He's charismatic, exciting.<br> He's too exciting, I'm afraid.<br> If they start bringing up-<br> Gentlemen, time is running out.<br> We must come to a decision.<br> "I have heard the word 'sir'...<br> "... more often...<br> "... than I have heard the word 'friend'.<br> "But I suppose...<br> "... there are other rewards for wealth.<br> "I have met with kings.<br> "During these conferences...<br> have suppressed bizarre thoughts:<br> Could I beat him in a foot race?<br> Could 1 throw a ball further than he?<br> "No matter what our fagzade,<br> we are all children. "<br> What about Chauncey Gardiner?<br> What do we know of the man?<br> Absolutely nothing.<br> We don't have an inkling of his past.<br> Correct. That could be an asset.<br> A man's past cripples him.<br> His background turns into a swamp<br> and invitee scrutiny.<br> Until this time, he hasn't said anything<br> that could be held against him.<br> And the mail and telephone response<br> from his appearance on that Burns Show...<br> ...was the highest they've ever had.<br> And?<br> And it was 95 percent pro.<br> I'm certainly open to the idea.<br> It would be absolute lunacy<br> to support the President for another term.<br> That is exactly why I agree<br> with Ben's final wishes.<br> "I was born into a position<br> of extreme wealth.<br> "I have spent many sleepless nights...<br> "... thinking about extreme poverty.<br> "I've lived a lot...<br> "... trembled a lot...<br> "... was surrounded by little men<br> who forgot that we enter naked...<br> "... and exit naked...<br> "... and that no accountant<br> can audit life in our favor. "<br> I do believe, gentlemen,<br> if we want to hold on to the Presidency...<br> ...our one and only chance<br> is Chauncey Gardiner.<br> "When I was a boy, I was told...<br> "... that the Lord fashioned us<br> from his own image.<br> "That's when I decided<br> to manufacture mirrors.<br> "Security,<br> "Tranquility,<br> "A Well-deserved rest.<br> "All the aims I have pursued...<br> "... will soon be realized.<br> "Life...<br> "... is a state of mind. "<br> I understand.<br> Is it all clear there, boys?<br> Can you read that?<br> What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?<br> "Now, get this, honky... "<br> Sorry, carry on.<br> Okay.<br> All set.<br> What was the message, Mr. Gardiner?<br> "Now, get this, honky.<br> "You go tell Raphael...<br> "... that I ain't taking no jive...
