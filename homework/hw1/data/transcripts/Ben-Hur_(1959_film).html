                        In the year of our Lord...<br> ...Judea, for nearly a century,<br> had lain under the mastery of Rome.<br> In the seventh year of the reign<br> ofAugustus Caesar...<br> ...an imperial decree<br> ordered every Judean...<br> ...each to return<br> to his place of birth...<br> ... to be counted and taxed.<br> Converging ways of many of them led<br> to their capital city, Jerusalem...<br> ... the troubled heart of their land.<br> The old city was dominated<br> by the fortress ofAntonia...<br> ... the seat of Roman power...<br> ...and by the great golden temple...<br> ... the outward sign of<br> an inward and imperishable faith.<br> Even while they obeyed<br> the will of Caesar...<br> ... the people clung proudly<br> to their ancient heritage...<br> ...always remembering<br> the promise of their prophets...<br> ... that one day there would be<br> born among them a redeemer...<br> ... to bring them salvation<br> and perfect freedom.<br> You'll be counted at Hebron.<br> -Name?<br> -Samuel.<br> -What city?<br> -Joppa.<br> -What family?<br> -Michael.<br> -Move on. Move on.<br> -Yes.<br> -Name?<br> -Joseph.<br> -What city?<br> -Nazareth.<br> -What family?<br> -David of Bethlehem.<br> And the woman?<br> My wife.<br> Move on.<br> You'll be counted at Bethlehem.<br> Come on, come on.<br> What village is this?<br> Nazareth.<br> We should arrive in Jerusalem<br> tomorrow night.<br> You're not watching<br> the soldiers, Joseph?<br> We've seen Romans before.<br> Yes. . .<br> . . .and we will see them again.<br> My table is not finished.<br> Where is your son?<br> He's walking in the hills.<br> He neglects his work, Joseph.<br> No.<br> Once, I reproached him with<br> forgetting his work. He said to me:<br> "I must be about my father's business. "<br> Then why isn't he here, working?<br> He's working.<br> Trumpeters of the legion!<br> Welcome, Messala.<br> The command is yours.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you for relieving me.<br> Drusus. . .<br> . . .when I was a boy, I dreamed<br> of commanding this garrison.<br> Now the wheel has turned.<br> I am in command.<br> Attention!<br> Aisle one, face right!<br> Forward!<br> I'd forgotten the heat.<br> If it were only the heat.<br> I lived here until I was 1 4.<br> Jerusalem was my home.<br> -My father was head of--<br> -Yes, I know.<br> Your father is well-remembered.<br> Fine governor.<br> If there can be such a thing<br> in this forsaken land.<br> If you want to rise, Sextus,<br> do the difficult.<br> I asked to be sent here.<br> You'll find the people changed<br> since you were a boy.<br> In what way?<br> Oh, won't pay their taxes,<br> an irrational resentment of Rome. . . .<br> There's nothing new in all that.<br> And then there's religion. I tell<br> you, they're drunk with religion.<br> They smash the statues of our gods,<br> even those of the emperor.<br> Punish them.<br> We do.<br> When we can find them.<br> Find the leaders.<br> You don't know. There's nothing<br> you can put your finger on.<br> There are strange forces<br> at work here.<br> This "messiah" business--<br> I know. There was one<br> predicted when I was a boy.<br> A king of the Jews, who will lead them<br> into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.<br> Makes your head spin.<br> There's a wild man<br> in the desert named John. . .<br> . . .who drowns people in water.<br> And a carpenter's son who does magic<br> tricks. "Miracles" they call them.<br> There's always a rabble-rouser<br> stirring up trouble.<br> No, no, no. This man is different.<br> He teaches that God is near,<br> in every man.<br> It's actually quite profound,<br> some of it.<br> You've been too long away from Rome.<br> Go back, Sextus.<br> Go to Capri.<br> Bathe, rest, lie by the sea. . .<br> . . .and forget that<br> God is in every man.<br> -There is divinity in only one man.<br> -Yes, I know.<br> The emperor is displeased.<br> He wishes Judea made into a more<br> obedient and disciplined province.<br> He's ordered me to restore order.<br> I shall carry out his wishes.<br> How? You can break a man's skull,<br> arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.<br> But how do you control this?<br> How do you fight an idea?<br> Especially a new idea.<br> There's a Jew outside.<br> He wants to see the tribune Messala.<br> I assume he has a name.<br> -He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.<br> -Then treat him like one!<br> Tell him I will join him.<br> Yes, tribune.<br> Centurion!<br> This was his country<br> before it was ours.<br> Don't forget that.<br> Yes, tribune.<br> Very wise. This Ben-Hur is<br> the richest man in Jerusalem.<br> And the head of one<br> of the greatest families in Judea.<br> We were friends as boys.<br> We were like brothers.<br> Sextus. . .<br> . . .you ask how to fight an idea.<br> Well, I'll tell you how.<br> With another idea.<br> I said I'd come back.<br> I never thought you would.<br> I'm so glad.<br> -Look at you.<br> -Look at you!<br> You've come back a tribune.<br> When I heard that news,<br> I drank a toast to you.<br> We'll drink another now.<br> -Your sister and mother?<br> -They're fine.<br> They've talked of you<br> ever since we knew you were coming.<br> -Is Tirzah married?<br> -No.<br> Suitors come and go, but she dreams.<br> She's been in love with you<br> since she was 5.<br> I can't wait to see them.<br> Do you still hunt jackals and lions?<br> Or have you become too dignified?<br> -Down Eros, up Mars!<br> -Down Eros, up Mars!<br> Where the beams cross?<br> Good.<br> After all these years!<br> Still close.<br> In every way.<br> I hope so.<br> I know.<br> You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew. . .<br> . . .whose life you once saved.<br> The best thing I ever did.<br> Judah. . .<br> . . .it will be very difficult<br> to govern here.<br> I'm going to need help.<br> Your help. Your advice.<br> -You want my advice?<br> -Yes, I do.<br> Withdraw your legions.<br> Give us our freedom.<br> Unfortunately, the emperor<br> is devoted to his empire.<br> He's particularly fond of Judea.<br> And Judea's not fond of the emperor.<br> Is there anything so sad<br> as unrequited love?<br> My quarters.<br> A bit grim.<br> Not grim.<br> Austere. Virtuous.<br> Roman.<br> I'm going to be second-in-command<br> to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.<br> He's coming in a few days<br> with more legions.<br> Then the rumors are true.<br> The emperor does not approve<br> of your countrymen.<br> There is rebellion in the wind.<br> It will be crushed.<br> But you and your family<br> need have no concern.<br> I'm next in authority to the governor,<br> and you're my friend.<br> -I'm a Jew.<br> -Ah, you are like a Roman!<br> What have you in common<br> with the troublemaking rabble?<br> -They're my people. I'm one of them.<br> -Be wise, Judah.<br> It's a Roman world. If you want to<br> live in it, you must become part of it.<br> You've changed.<br> I've grown up. I've seen the world<br> since I left Jerusalem.<br> I've seen Rome. It's no accident<br> that one small village on the Tiber. . .<br> . . .was chosen to rule the world.<br> Your legions.<br> It wasn't just our legions.<br> Other countries have armies,<br> fine armies. I know, I fought them.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, it was fate that chose us<br> to civilize the world. And we have.<br> Our roads and ships connect<br> every corner of the earth.<br> Roman law, architecture, literature<br> are the glory of the human race.<br> I believe in the future of my people.<br> Of course you do.<br> And you can help them.<br> How?<br> You're an aristocrat.<br> Your family's name is honored.<br> You're a prince to your people.<br> You're rich and powerful.<br> Your reputation is stainless.<br> They'd listen if you<br> spoke out against rebellion.<br> Persuade your people that<br> their resistance to Rome is stupid.<br> It is worse than stupid, futile!<br> For it can end in only one way,<br> extinction for your people!<br> I'm against violence.<br> Everyone knows this.<br> I've spoken against it.<br> I shall do so again.<br> Then we're agreed!<br> Now, when can I come<br> to see your family?<br> -We had hoped tomorrow.<br> -Good.<br> And now for our toast.<br> It's dreadful wine, by the way.<br> It's especially fermented<br> for the Roman army.<br> You're very cruel to your conquerors.<br> It's an insane world.<br> But in it there is one sanity:<br> The loyalty of old friends.<br> Judah, we must believe in one another.<br> Will you drink to that?<br> With all my heart.<br> Here it is, the place I've remembered.<br> The court where we played<br> at changing the guard.<br> The roof where we'd throw pebbles<br> at people in the street and then hide.<br> -We were rascals, weren't we?<br> -No, you were good boys.<br> I would have that time again.<br> And here it is. Nothing has changed.<br> Except for the fountain.<br> -The old well would go dry, remember?<br> -Promptly, every summer.<br> A new fountain and a new Tirzah.<br> You've grown up.<br> -He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?<br> -No?<br> Of course he has. He was a boy<br> when he left us, now he's a man.<br> With great responsibilities.<br> Come.<br> The emperor builds and builds,<br> turning brick to marble.<br> Oh, I almost forgot.<br> I brought you this.<br> I've never seen anything<br> like this before. It's beautiful!<br> -Is it Roman?<br> -It's Libyan. I was there last year.<br> A tremendous campaign.<br> Our armies met on the coast.<br> After two days of fighting, they fled.<br> We marched on their capital.<br> Barbaric city, but fascinating.<br> Or was, till we destroyed it.<br> Now it's nothing but ashes.<br> I'm boring you with soldier stories.<br> Come with me, there's something<br> I want to show you.<br> Thank you for this.<br> I chose the right present for you.<br> It's a brooch for a woman.<br> What do you think of it?<br> Magnificent.<br> It's Arabic.<br> I think he has the look of the breed.<br> I've raised him.<br> Let me try him sometime.<br> Whenever you like. He's yours.<br> Do you mean you'll give me this?<br> Oh, Judah.<br> You are good. It's going<br> to be like old times, I know it.<br> Judah, tell me, did you. . .<br> . . .think about what I said?<br> Yes. Talked to a number<br> of people already.<br> Spoken against violence,<br> against incidents.<br> Most of the men agree with me.<br> Most? Not all?<br> No, not all.<br> Who does not agree?<br> Well, the resentful, the impatient.<br> Who are they?<br> Yes, Judah. Who are they?<br> Would I retain your friendship<br> if I became an informer?<br> Telling the names of criminals<br> is not informing.<br> They're not criminals, Messala.<br> They're patriots.<br> Patriots?!<br> Let me explain something to you.<br> Something you may not know.<br> The emperor is watching us.<br> At this moment, he watches the East.<br> This is my great opportunity,<br> and yours too.<br> If I bring order here,<br> I can have any post I want.<br> You'll rise with me, I promise.<br> And do you know where it can end?<br> Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side<br> of Caesar himself.<br> I mean it. It can happen<br> and this is the moment.<br> I swear, this is the time.<br> The emperor is watching us, judging<br> us. All I need do is serve him.<br> And all you need do<br> is help me serve him.<br> -You speak as if he were God.<br> -He is God. The only God.<br> He is power,<br> real power on earth, not--<br> Not that.<br> Help me, Judah.<br> I would do anything<br> for you, Messala. . .<br> . . .except betray my own people.<br> In the name of all the gods, what do<br> the lives of a few Jews mean to you?<br> If I cannot persuade them, that does<br> not mean I would help you murder them.<br> Besides, you must<br> understand this, Messala.<br> I believe in the past<br> and future of my people.<br> Future? You are a conquered people.<br> You may conquer the land.<br> You may slaughter the people.<br> But that is not the end.<br> We will rise again.<br> You live on dead dreams.<br> You live on the myths of the past.<br> Solomon's glory is gone.<br> You think it will return?<br> Joshua will not rise again<br> to save you nor David.<br> There is only one reality in<br> the world today. Look to the West.<br> Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!<br> Better a fool<br> than a traitor or a killer.<br> -I am a soldier.<br> -Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.<br> -I warn you--<br> -No! I warn you.<br> Rome is an affront to God.<br> Rome is strangling my people<br> and my country, the whole earth!<br> But not forever.<br> And I tell you, the day Rome falls<br> there will be a shout of freedom. . .<br> . . .such as the world<br> has never heard before.<br> Either you help me or you oppose me.<br> You have no other choice.<br> You're either for me or against me.<br> If that is the choice. . .<br> . . .then I am against you.<br> There they are.<br> Where's Messala?<br> -Where's--?<br> -He's gone.<br> Gone?<br> -But why?<br> -He couldn't stay.<br> -What happened?<br> -A new tribune must have many duties.<br> Come. Let us have dinner.<br> Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,<br> King of the world. . .<br> . . .who bringeth to us<br> bread from the earth.<br> We shall never see him again, Tirzah.<br> He wanted to use me<br> to betray our people.<br> -Master, the caravan from Antioch.<br> -Yes, Amrah, I saw.<br> Simonides.<br> -Oh, welcome homecoming.<br> -Master.<br> Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.<br> Amber and jade for me.<br> Silk for Tirzah.<br> And for the master, lberian wine.<br> Not to mention the best gift of all,<br> your presence.<br> You do your servant honor.<br> I also bring good news from Antioch.<br> -Caravans from Petra.<br> -Have all arrived.<br> -Good.<br> -Here is the accounting.<br> And what of Numidia?<br> The trade route is ours,<br> guaranteed by treaty with the king.<br> Once a year,<br> you bring your accounting.<br> And once a year,<br> I find myself wealthier.<br> Yeah, but my greatest treasure<br> is my steward.<br> My life belongs to the House of Hur.<br> Nothing else exists for me,<br> except my daughter.<br> -She must be a young woman by now.<br> -Yes, and your property.<br> She was born<br> the daughter of your slave.<br> When I inherited you,<br> I inherited a friend, not a slave.<br> Still, Esther has come with me from<br> Antioch for your permission to marry.<br> It's granted.
