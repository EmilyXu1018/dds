Got it.<br> Hit a couple more!<br> All right.<br> Where you been?<br> It's kind of late.<br> Oh, I was-- was out.<br> Out where?<br> Just... took a walk.<br> Josh, what's wrong?<br> What is it?<br> I haven't told you something<br> because I didn't think that<br> you were gonna believe me.<br> And even if you did believe me,<br> I didn't think that you were<br> gonna like me anymore, so--<br> Oh, honey, come here.<br> You can tell me anything.<br> What?<br> Susan, I'm not<br> what you think I am.<br> Uh, what do you mean?<br> Before I met you,<br> I was in Little League.<br> Um, I was in Little League,<br> and I rode my bike to school,<br> and I played with my friends<br> and hung out with them and--<br> Josh, what are you<br> What are you talking about?<br> I want to go home.<br> I miss my family, Susan,<br> and I want to go home.<br> - Oh, my God. You're married.<br> - No.<br> This was too good to be true.<br> There had to be something.<br> Susan, I'm not married.<br> You're not?<br> No.<br> - I'm a child.<br> - What?<br> I'm a child, Susan,<br> and I'm-- I'm not ready<br> for all of this.<br> Oh, that's fine.<br> That is-- That's just great.<br> You see, what happened--<br> No, I understand. "I'm not ready<br> to make a commitment.<br> I'm not ready to accept<br> the responsibility."<br> No, you don't understand.<br> - I'm 13 years old.<br> - Oh, and who isn't?<br> You think that there isn't<br> a frightened kid inside of me too?<br> No, I mean I really am 13.<br> I went to bed one night and<br> I was a kid, woke up the next<br> morning, I was a grown-up.<br> Oh, right. And just yesterday<br> I was a schoolgirl with pigtails.<br> Why are you doing this, Josh?<br> - There was this carnival in NewJersey.<br> - Please.<br> I made a wish on a machine<br> called the Zoltar machine.<br> Oh, stop it.<br> It was a Zoltar machine.<br> It had this bobbing head,<br> and it looked like a devil.<br> If you got a quarter in<br> the devil's mouth, you could<br> make a wish, and I did.<br> So I made a wish to be big.<br> That's what I'm trying to tell you.<br> I changed into a grown-up,<br> when I'm really just a kid.<br> Fine, Josh, you're a kid.<br> Look, I really don't know what it is<br> that you're trying to tell me,<br> but we have a very big presentation<br> to give tomorrow,<br> so I'm gonna get some sleep.<br> Hello?<br> Yeah, do you have<br> a Zoltar machine?<br> Nope. Never heard of it.<br> Yeah. Yeah, thanks.<br> Wait. I need a paper.<br> Would you get me<br> some gum?<br> Thank you.<br> These are the notes,<br> in case you want 'em.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, should get the cards set up<br> before everyone comes in.<br> Okay.<br> Hello?<br> Yeah, do you have<br> a Zoltar machine?<br> Got one right here.<br> You do?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah! Yeah, thanks.<br> That's great!<br> Yeah!<br> MacMillan Toys. I'll transfer.<br> Right there.<br> Sea Point Park, New York.<br> Well?<br> Yes?<br> They're waiting for you,<br> Mr. Baskin.<br> - Thanks.<br> - See you around.<br> There's this flat screen<br> on the inside with, uh,<br> with pictures on it,<br> and you read it, and you have<br> to make a choice of what<br> the character's gonna do.<br> If he's gonna fight the dragon,<br> you push one of the buttons--<br> Uh--<br> - Paul?<br> - I don't get it.<br> Well--<br> Paul, stop it.<br> It's a comic book that--<br> See, there's a computer chip inside<br> which stores the choices.<br> So, when you reach the end<br> of the page, you decide<br> where the story goes.<br> That's the point.<br> Terrific, Susan.<br> The kid makes his<br> own decision.<br> This is really possible?<br> - Yeah.<br> In fact, it's a very simple program.<br> Isn't that right?<br> So what happens when<br> you run out of choices?<br> That's the great thing. You can<br> just sell different adventures.<br> Just pop in a brand-new disk,<br> and you get a whole new set of options.<br> - We could market this<br> on a comic book rack.<br> -Mm-hmm.<br> I'll be right back.<br> How much<br> would the unit cost?<br> Our initial figure is around seven--<br> Around seven dollars,<br> with a retail cost<br> of about $ 18.95.<br> You expect a kid to pay<br> $19 for a comic book?<br> I think a kid--<br> Will you excuse me?<br> - What's going on?<br> Let 'em be.<br> Josh?<br> Josh?<br> Oh.<br> More.<br> Will you take me<br> to Sea Point Park, New York?<br> Get in.<br> Sea Point Park? Josh!<br> Hey! Not so fast!<br> Sorry. Here.<br> Josh! Josh!<br> See you back home!<br> Yeah!<br> Excuse me. Do you know him?<br> You knowJosh?<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Look, you have to tell me<br> where he went.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm-- I'm his girlfriend.<br> Ew.<br> Billy Kopecki.<br> You have to tell me where<br> he went. Where did he go?<br> Please tell me.<br> Tell me!<br> It's tough to find<br> a cab out here.<br> Thanks.<br> Work, damn it!<br> I wish I was a kid again.<br> Josh?<br> Susan.<br> You know, you don't<br> walk out on somebody.<br> You don't just get up<br> and leave and-- and--<br> and walk out like that.<br> You don't do that.<br> I know. I know.<br> I'm really sorry.<br> I'm really sorry,<br> but I didn't know<br> what to do.<br> I didn't know<br> what to say.<br> Oh, God.<br> You got your wish.<br> I tried to tell you.<br> I didn't listen.<br> I guess I didn't hear you,<br> or-- or want to, or<br> I tried to tell you last night.<br> How would I have-- Even if I<br> did listen, how would I know?<br> I've been thinking about this.<br> Why would I know that?<br> I've been trying<br> I've been thinking about it,<br> and there's a million reasons<br> for me to go home,<br> but there's only one reason<br> for me to stay.<br> What-- What reason is that?<br> Well, you.<br> Oh, come on. Come on.<br> Come on. Come on. Come on.<br> So, uh, what<br> what are you, 15, 16?<br> I'm-- I'm 13.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Well, that explains it.<br> Maybe you could come with me.<br> No.<br> No, I--<br> Why not?<br> I've I've been there before.<br> It's hard enough the first time.<br> You know what I mean?<br> No, you don't know<br> what I mean.<br> Come on.<br> I'll drive you home.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No, I'll be okay.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Ten years, who knows?<br> Maybe you should<br> hold on to my number.<br> So this is where you live.<br> Which one is it?<br> The one right there.<br> Oh. It's nice.<br> I'm gonna miss you.<br> I'm gonna miss you too.<br> You won't even remember me.<br> Oh, yes, I will.<br> Bye.<br> Ma?<br> Ma, it's me.<br> Josh?<br> Josh?Josh!<br> Oh, my God!<br> Oh, thank God you're home!<br> Oh, Ma, I missed you all so much.<br> I'm just not good enough.<br> What are you<br> talking about?<br> You've been hitting the ball<br> over the fence almost<br> every time in stickball.<br> You just gotta get used<br> to a fatter bat.<br> You really think<br> I could do it?<br> Yeah.<br> Come on.
