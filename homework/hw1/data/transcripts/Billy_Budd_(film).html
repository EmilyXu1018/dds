Turn your head.<br> All right, I'll let you off this time...<br> ...but don't do it again, boy-o.<br> I'm warning you.<br> - Will you shake hands, mate?<br> - Shake hands, is it?<br> - You're a hell of a peacemaker, Billy.<br> - Well, you beat me fair.<br> That's the first time<br> I ever hear him eat his words.<br> And what a terrible diet that is.<br> Worse than the stew.<br> Don't you be getting any wrong ideas.<br> I'm warning you.<br> - I'm more than a match for you, boy-o.<br> - Aye.<br> - I took you off your guard.<br> - Aye.<br> You make friends quickly, Master Budd.<br> Come here, boy.<br> What was the fight about?<br> Well, I...<br> Nothing to say.<br> And the rest of you?<br> Mr. Claggart.<br> Watch what you're doing.<br> Don't you ever touch me.<br> - I swear...<br> - You swear.<br> What?<br> None of you have anything to say?<br> It was nothing, master-at-arms.<br> A test of strength.<br> You'll need your strength<br> for the fighting to come, boy.<br> Aye, Budd.<br> You do indeed make friends quickly.<br> That's a good quality to have.<br> Billy...<br> ...be careful of the master-at-arms.<br> Careful? Why?<br> He had a pleasant smile for me.<br> That's why.<br> Make eight bells!<br> - First watch aboard a man-of-war, Billy?<br> - Hey, don't fall.<br> Or jump.<br> Come on, get up there.<br> Aye, he's quite a hand for jokes.<br> Always cheerful too.<br> Always smiling, waving at people.<br> Lovely little character. Always...<br> Afternoon, sir.<br> Wind seems to be freshening a little.<br> With your permission, sir.<br> "Freshening" did you say,<br> master-at-arms?<br> Yes, it is indeed,<br> master-at-arms. Indeed.<br> Our young newcomer<br> seems to feel quite at home.<br> Aye, sir. Indeed he does.<br> Yes.<br> He's even melted<br> old starry Vere's stone heart.<br> He'll make the old Avenger<br> a merchantman yet.<br> The trouble is I just can't find<br> the distances like I used to.<br> I'll take your turn tomorrow<br> while you stay below decks.<br> Who's there?<br> Well, what's up, then, Squeak?<br> Routine inspection, Jenkins.<br> What's the matter? Sick, are you?<br> My health does not concern you.<br> No need to be uncivil, Jenkins.<br> Is this sickness something<br> master-at-arms should know about?<br> He'll know<br> when I want him to know, boy-o.<br> Well, I hope it's nothing serious.<br> - Evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> Oh, it's on a petty report<br> you are again, Budd.<br> Well, I mean, look at it.<br> It's a pity you will not learn.<br> I don't understand.<br> That's the second time<br> it's happened like this.<br> Well, next time,<br> sew yourself up in it...<br> ...and then you'll be sure to know<br> if somebody meddles with it.<br> Oh, Dansker?<br> What?<br> Reading?<br> How many times<br> must you be on ship's report...<br> ...before they tie you to the gratings<br> and flog you?<br> That's a matter he decides.<br> He?<br> Aye...<br> ...the master-at-arms, Mr. Claggart.<br> Go on. That's all you're gonna get.<br> Fish.<br> They're serving fish.<br> I can't think why.<br> It's Wednesday.<br> However, I hope it's better<br> than that horsemeat we've been getting.<br> Maybe it's a seahorse.<br> Here, Jenkins,<br> aren't you eating anything?<br> Well, you've got to eat something,<br> you know, or go sick.<br> Well, at least come in out of the sun.<br> Handsomely done, lad.<br> But then handsome is<br> as handsome does.<br> Clean up that mess.<br> I thought that I said,<br> "Clean up that mess."<br> That's the mess boy's job.<br> It's yours when I order it so.<br> I'll clean it up.<br> After all, sir, it was I who spilled it.<br> Stand back, boy.<br> Might as well clean that up too.<br> - Sir, he's sick.<br> - Sick?<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> Is that what you'd like to do, Jenkins?<br> Perhaps you'd do it...<br> ...if you weren't so...<br> So sick.<br> You others feel well enough, I hope.<br> Here I am, unarmed.<br> Now's the time.<br> To make it easier...<br> ...l'll turn my back on you.<br> You lack fiber, men.<br> Or have you some more<br> devious plan for me?<br> - Some night when there's no moon.<br> - Don't be a fool.<br> That's a very good plan indeed.<br> A plan worthy of pigs like you.<br> You'll soon feel better, Jenkins.<br> Just keep your hate for me alive<br> until that time.<br> Damn his flaming soul.<br> I can't stand it no more.<br> What are you gonna do about it, mate?<br> Stick him. Stick him<br> one of these nights like he said.<br> He's waiting for it.<br> Don't do nothing foolish, mate. You can<br> get hung for no more than an angry look.<br> Oh, I'm sick of the taste of blood, boy-o.<br> Why is he so friendly to me?<br> It was I who spilled the food.<br> Don't you believe it.<br> It was him lurched into you. I saw it.<br> I'll ask him why.<br> No, you don't, Billy.<br> Not a word, you hear?<br> Just thank your stars he's still<br> smiling at you, lad, and leave it at that.<br> He never did smile at me. Never.<br> Not even the first day.<br> It's all right for you to give advice,<br> you've had your food. I'm hungry.<br> That don't mean much.<br> I ate mine, I'm hungry too.<br> I'll ask him when I get a chance.<br> I will.<br> You recommend Budd<br> for a post of more responsibility...<br> ...yet here's his name<br> on ship's report again.<br> These are just misdemeanors.<br> Nothing serious.<br> An infraction of any rule is serious.<br> - Mr. Ratcliffe.<br> - Sir.<br> You took him off that merchant ship.<br> When he cried out:<br> "Goodbye, old Rights of Man,"<br> what did you take it he meant?<br> At the time, sir, I wasn't sure.<br> Now I'm sure he meant nothing.<br> He knew of the shameful mutinies<br> at the Nore and at Spithead.<br> It was common gossip<br> aboard that merchantman.<br> I charged him to keep<br> the knowledge to himself.<br> As far as I can ascertain,<br> he's kept his secret well.<br> - Must be a hard one to keep.<br> - Yes.<br> He was the only man I dared impress,<br> if you remember, sir.<br> The boy has a quality of trust.<br> Thank you, Ratcliffe, that'll be all.<br> - Claggart. What does he recommend?<br> - I've not discussed it with him, sir.<br> - Well, why not, pray? The boy has sworn...<br> - With your permission, sir.<br> In this matter,<br> I didn't think it necessary.<br> What do you know about Claggart?<br> Before he came aboard this ship,<br> I mean.<br> Not much, sir. Nobody does.<br> - There are rumors.<br> - Rumors?<br> - But then there always are in any ship.<br> - What rumors?<br> That he was once arraigned<br> at the King's Bench...<br> ...on some mysterious charge...<br> ...then volunteered with the king's navy<br> as payment.<br> How flattering for us.<br> Too much of the navy<br> is made up of debtors...<br> ...murderers and drunkards without<br> the steady legs to escape impressment.<br> If it were not true in his case...<br> ...then why would a man of his intellect<br> have accepted life aboard ship...<br> ...on such a lowly station?<br> - Aye. Aye.<br> He's a good master-at-arms, mark you.<br> He's the best I've ever sailed with.<br> The ship is yours, sir.<br> - The choice of men to man her too.<br> - Choice.<br> What master-at-arms<br> is ever loved by the crew?<br> Loved?<br> They hate him, sir.<br> That may be better than indifference,<br> Seymour. Who knows?<br> The fact that I command<br> does not relieve me from doubts.<br> On the contrary, it magnifies them.<br> A man-of-war does not come to life<br> until it's in action.<br> Will we acquit ourselves well...<br> ...or badly?<br> What kind of a weapon<br> have we forged?<br> Or when the time comes,<br> will I know how to use it?<br> Claggart is a force for order, Mr. Seymour.<br> A force for order I must have.<br> Sir...<br> ...if he should be opposed<br> to Budd's promotion...<br> You know, Seymour, there are some men<br> who cannot stand too much perfection.<br> They see it as a disease...<br> ...which must be stamped out<br> at its first rash showing.<br> I will think over<br> the matter of Budd's promotion.<br> - What's the matter with him?<br> - What is it, mate?<br> Oh, it's no good, boy-o. I feel sick.<br> Sick and dizzy.<br> - Come on, let's get aloft.<br> - No, wait.<br> Get him down below.<br> Where are you taking him?<br> Sick berth.<br> This sickness<br> begins to grow tedious, Jenkins.<br> How does it strike you?<br> In the head?<br> In the limbs?<br> Maybe in the gut.<br> Does it exist at all?<br> - Can't you see?<br> - We're undermanned.<br> - Get aloft.<br> - You can't let a sick man...<br> ...hang from a spar like that.<br> He'll fall, sure.<br> We're in French waters.<br> Orders are a man on every spar.<br> Now, get aloft.<br> - You think I'm shirking?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Then be damned to you.<br> I'll stand my watch.<br> - At least let the ship's doctor...<br> - I said I'll stand my watch.<br> French waters...<br> ...undermanned.<br> That's not why you're sending me aloft,<br> Mr. Claggart.<br> A sail one mile off the starboard bow.<br> A Frenchman. Beat to quarters.<br> Clear for action.<br> Beat to quarters! Clear for action!<br> Mr. Seymour, sir.<br> Here, get ahold of that!<br> Go on, you lazy landlubbers there!<br> Go on, get ahold of this.<br> - Move on there, move on.<br> - Keep moving!<br> Battle stations fully manned, sir.<br> - Set more sail and give chase.<br> - We'll never catch her, sir.<br> - She may not have seen us.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Set more sail, Mr. Leverett.<br> - Set more sail, Mr. Seymour.<br> - Steer close to the wind, sir?<br> - Aye.<br> - Quartermaster, steer by the wind.<br> - By the wind it is, sir.<br> Why is that man leaving his post?<br> Who is it?<br> - Budd, sir.<br> - Budd?<br> For the love of God, Billy...<br> ...look to yourself.<br> Claggart!<br> Damn your bloody eyes!<br> The man is dead, Mr. Ratcliffe.<br> - Take the body below.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> You, you. Thompson, Ridley.<br> Bear him below.<br> - The Frenchman's drawing ahead, sir.<br> - Commence firing, Mr. Seymour.<br> - But, sir, it's hopeless. It's out of range.<br> - Yes, Mr. Seymour.<br> - We can attract other enemy ships...<br> - I know your objection.<br> We can't sink the Frenchman. All I can do<br> is to lessen the tension aboard my ship.<br> Commence firing, Mr. Seymour.<br> - Starboard battery, open fire!<br> - Open fire, sir.<br> - Fire at will.<br> - Fire at will!<br> Fire at will.<br> - Fire at will!<br> - What are we firing at?<br> Don't question the commands,<br> obey them! Fire!<br> Look out!<br> - Mr. Seymour.<br> - Sir.<br> Officers will wear swords all the time<br> from now on.<br> We've lost her, sir.<br> - Give up the chase, Mr. Seymour.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> What else do you expect me<br> to tell you?<br> Hand in your arms.<br> Oh, Kincaid.<br> You're under ship's arrest.<br> Take him below.<br> Hand in your arms.<br> Hand in your arms.<br> What's the matter, master-at-arms?<br> These dogs are out of temper, sir.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know, sir.<br> What is this about?<br> You will come to attention<br> when I address you!<br> May I remind you<br> that this ship is at war?<br> This is a wartime cruise.<br> We sail under the Articles of War.<br> Volunteer or impressed man,<br> veteran, seaman, or recruit...<br> ...you are no longer civilians but sailors.<br> A crew that I shall mold into a weapon.<br> One lawless act...<br> ...one spurt of rebel temper<br> from any one of you...<br> ...high or low...<br> ...I shall pay you out<br> in coin you know of.<br> You have only two duties here:<br> To fight and to obey.<br> And I will bend<br> each contumacious spirit...<br> ...each stiff-neck,<br> prideful soul of you...<br> ...or crush you...<br> ...if I must.<br> Abide by the Articles of War<br> and my commands...<br> ...or they will cut you down.<br> Now choose.<br> Kincaid, you shouted. Why?<br> Why did Jenkins fall, sir?<br> Master-at-arms, that accident, the man<br> who fell upon the deck from the yardarm...<br> ...do you know how this occurred?<br> - I do not, sir.<br> You were his messmates.<br> Does any man here<br> know how this occurred?<br> You?<br> No, sir.<br> Boy, you left your post. Why?<br> I knew that Jenkins was sick, sir.<br> I saw him sway.<br> You knew he was sick?<br> Mr. Claggart,<br> did you send a sick man aloft?<br> He said he was.<br> But when I questioned him,<br> he changed his mind...<br> ...and went to stand his watch.<br> But that's not the way it happened,<br> Mr. Claggart. Don't you remember?<br> That is the way it happened, sir.<br> I see.<br> Hand in your arms.<br> Take him below.<br> We therefore commit his body<br> to the deep...<br> ...to be turned into corruption.<br> Looking for the resurrection<br> of the body...<br> ...when the sea shall give up her dead.<br> - The sea shall give up her dead.<br> - And the corruptible bodies...<br> - And the corruptible bodies...<br> ...of those who sleep in him...<br> ...of those who sleep in him...<br> ...shall be changed...<br> ...shall be changed...<br> ...and...<br> ...and made like unto his glorious body...<br> ...according to the mighty working...<br> ...whereby he is able...<br> ...to subdue all things...<br> ...unto himself.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> Ship's company, dismiss!<br> Well, that's the end of Enoch Jenkins.<br> Over the side he goes<br> and his mates soon forget him.<br> They'll not forget him so soon,<br> I'm thinking.<br> Whatever's happened to Jenkins,<br> he ain't worried none.<br> He's got a hundred fathoms<br> between him...<br> ...and the troubles of this life.<br> I'd rather be buried at sea<br> than on the shore...<br> ...when I come to die.<br> Will you stand by the plank, mates...<br> ...so I can shake a friendly hand<br> before I sink?<br> Budd...<br> ...Captain Vere wishes to see you.<br> Come in.<br> Seaman Budd, sir.<br> - You sent for me, sir?<br> - Yes, Budd.<br> Your divisional officer recommends you<br> for a post of more responsibility.<br> He thinks you can perform duties<br> of a higher station, and so do I.<br> The spirit you showed last night<br> warrants it.<br> From now on,<br> you're captain of the foretop.<br> Yes, that's a real honor<br> for a man so new aboard.<br> You can trust me, sir.<br> I do.<br> Very well. That's all.<br> Aye, aye, sir. Thanks.<br> Captain Vere, sir...<br> ...with your permission.<br> - Yes?<br> You must be aware, sir,<br> that Budd is...<br> Well...<br> It's unlike you to falter, Mr. Claggart.<br> He has been aboard such a short time.<br> Long enough to prove himself to me.<br> He left his station last night.<br> In a good cause no doubt, master-at-arms.<br> He showed initiative.<br> The captaincy of the foretop is his reward.<br> With your permission, sir.<br> Will there not be some dissatisfaction<br> among those...<br> ...who've been aboard<br> much longer than Budd?<br> Oh, master-at-arms,<br> I concern myself with these matters.<br> They're really none of your function.<br> Until such a time as the senior topmen<br> formally object to Budd for incapacity...<br> ...and for no other reason whatsoever...<br> ...he is captain of the foretop.<br> Make it so on the bill.<br> - Captain Vere, sir, with your permission.<br> - What?<br> In the matter of Kincaid,<br> the man who shouted from the mast.<br> It was a serious breach of ship's discipline<br> while engaging the enemy.<br> What punishment do you recommend?<br> Ten lashes.<br> It was while engaging the enemy.<br> Ten lashes.<br> - Mr. Claggart.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Do you consider the sentence just?<br> May I speak freely, sir?<br> I do not ask questions<br> in order to get insincere answers.<br> Ten lashes would seem to me<br> a mild sentence...<br> ...under peacetime conditions.<br> A hundred would, to my mind,<br> be appropriate.<br> A hundred?<br> We must serve the law, sir...<br> ...or give up the right<br> and privilege of service.<br> It is only within that law that we may<br> use our discretions according to our rank.<br> You are so lucid and so intelligent<br> for the rank you hold, master-at-arms.<br> I thank you, sir.<br> Yes. That's no flattery, Mr. Claggart,<br> it's a melancholy fact.<br> It's sad to see such qualities of mind<br> bent to such a sorry purpose.<br> What's the reason for it?<br> I am what I am, sir...<br> ...and what the world has made me.<br> - The world?<br> The world demands<br> that behind every peacemaker...<br> ...there be the gun,<br> the gallows, the jail.<br> Do you think it will always be so?<br> - I have no reason not to, sir.<br> - You live without hope.<br> I live.<br> But remember, Mr. Claggart...<br> ...that even the man<br> who wields the whip...<br> ...cannot defy the code we must obey...<br> ...and not be broken by it.<br> - That'll be all.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> With your permission, sir.<br> Is it still to be 10 lashes?<br> It is.<br> One...<br> ...two...<br> ...three...<br> ...four...<br> ...five...<br> ...six...<br> ...seven...<br> ...eight...<br> ...nine...<br> ...10.<br> Release the prisoner.<br> Dismiss ship's company, please,<br> Mr. Seymour.<br> Ship's company, dismiss.<br> I expect the French will be putting us<br> to our stations any hour now.<br> Aye.<br> In the question of Jenkins...<br> ...Budd was telling the truth.<br> - I know, sir.<br> What are you going to do<br> about Claggart?<br> What can I do but watch and wait?<br> No court-martial would do more than<br> strip him of his rank for such misconduct.<br> And then what? As a rating,<br> he'd be slaughtered by the other men.<br> And who would replace him?<br> Would the French refrain from attacking us<br> while we settled our petty differences?<br> No, I...<br> I must give him his head until some act<br> puts him squarely counter to the law...<br> ...and then let the law consume him.<br> What would you do<br> if you were captain of this ship?<br> I'm not captain of this ship, sir.<br> One day you may be, Philip.<br> And then?<br> Remember.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> Good evening.<br> Will it be all right if I stay topside a bit<br> to watch the water?<br> I suppose the handsome sailor may do<br> many things forbidden to his messmates.<br> The sea's calm by night, isn't it?<br> Calm and peaceful.<br> You've made a good impression<br> on the captain, Billy Budd.<br> You have a pleasant way with you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> If you wish to make a good impression<br> on me too, however...<br> ...you will need to curb your tongue.<br> - Now, sir?<br> Not now.<br> Can it be that you really don't<br> understand my words?<br> Is it ignorance or irony...<br> ...that makes you speak so simply?<br> It must be ignorance, sir...<br> ...because I don't understand<br> the other word.<br> Let us see which it is.<br> Tell me, without fear, if you can...<br> ...what do you think of me?<br> I never met a man like you before.<br> You blame me for Jenkins' death.<br> You must have had a reason<br> for doing what you did.<br> If you thought I had a reason...<br> ...why did you contradict my words<br> before the captain?<br> In my ignorance, sir,<br> I could not guess the reason.<br> I only knew the truth and told it.<br> The sea is calm, you said...<br> ...peaceful.<br> Calm above...<br> ...but below,<br> a world of gliding monsters...<br> ...preying on their fellows.<br> Murderers, all of them.<br> Only the strongest teeth survive.<br> And who's to tell me it's any different<br> here onboard, or yonder...<br> ...on dry land?<br> You knew my reputation...<br> ...and yet you dared to speak<br> what you call the truth. Why?<br> I know some of the men<br> are fearful of you, hate you...<br> ...but I told them,<br> you can't be as they think you are.<br> Why not, pray?<br> No man can take pleasure in cruelty.<br> No?<br> Tell me, do you fear the lash?<br> Aye.<br> And will you speak the truth again?<br> I'm on my honor, sir,<br> if the captain asks.<br> Why are you laughing, boy?<br> Laughter's good, sir.<br> And it's good to hear you laugh.<br> Laughter's good?<br> Even the laughter of fools,<br> aimed at nothing?<br> No, sir. You didn't laugh at nothing.<br> What did I laugh at, then?<br> I don't know, sir...<br> ...but I think you were laughing<br> at yourself.<br> Why should I laugh at myself?<br> There's times when all men do,<br> men as you can call men.<br> They make mistakes...<br> ...behave like fools.<br> - They do?<br> Tell me in all ignorance,<br> do you dare understand me, then?<br> I think so, sir.<br> Why did Jenkins die?<br> - You did not wish his death.<br> - No, I did not.<br> You didn't even hate him.<br> I think that sometimes<br> you hate yourself.<br> I was thinking, sir...<br> ...the nights are lonely.<br> Perhaps I could talk to you<br> between watches...<br> ...when you've nothing else to do.<br> Loneliness.<br> What do you know of loneliness?<br> Them's alone as want to be.<br> Nights are long...<br> ...conversation helps pass the time.<br> Can I talk to you again, then?<br> It would mean a lot to me.<br> Perhaps to me too.<br> Oh, no.<br> You would charm me too, huh?<br> Get away.<br> Sir?<br> Get away.<br> Master-at-arms.<br> Mr. Claggart, sir?<br> What's the "Get thee behind me" for?<br> Which of us is Satan, then?<br> Why, I'm not ambitious.<br> Well?<br> I can't find nothing wrong<br> with Budd's gear.<br> All stowed perfect.<br> Well, disarrange it, man.<br> You've done it before.<br> I was nearly caught.<br> Two of his mates woke up.<br> Be more careful.<br> I want him on report,<br> now more than ever.<br> - Do as you wish.<br> - Well, it's not easy.<br> How's your gear, Squeak?<br> All stowed perfect?<br> Moon's in and out tonight.<br> There's a storm somewhere.<br> Aye, old man.<br> There's a storm somewhere.<br> Well...<br> ...I have my watch to do.<br> Billy.<br> Billy.<br> Slip into the lee forechains.<br> There's something in the wind.<br> - What you...?<br> - No, no, no. Don't speak here.<br> I'll meet you there.<br> We'll have to talk quickish, Billy.<br> The dawn'll be on us<br> before you can say "mutiny."<br> What is it you want? It's cold it is<br> and against the rules to be up here.<br> I saw you and Claggart talking.<br> I don't know what was said, not liking<br> to listen to other folks' conversations...<br> ...but if it's buttering him up you are,<br> beware.<br> I tried that.<br> I was frightened of him.<br> Well, that's how I began, see?<br> I talked to him one night,<br> and after that, I was his slave.<br> I amused him, see?<br> Something about me amuses him.<br> There's nothing I can do about it.<br> Anyway, I started spying on people<br> for him and the like.<br> Only to escape the lash.<br> Well, a man can't help<br> being frightened, can he?<br> I mean, it's human in some of us.<br> Every time he laughs at me,<br> I know I'm safe.<br> Until the next time, that is.<br> It's only old Dansker<br> passing away his watch.<br> Hey. You know when you kept<br> finding yourself on report?<br> Well, that was my doing.<br> Yeah, but I was only obeying orders.<br> His orders, Claggart's.<br> Claggart's?<br> - I thought it was you, out of spite.<br> - Me?<br> But I got no spite in me.<br> Now, take tonight. I'm supposed to<br> get you on report again, see?<br> I was sent by Claggart<br> to steal your kit while you was asleep.<br> Instead, I woke you up.<br> My conscience<br> wouldn't permit me to obey...<br> ...whatever the consequences.<br> I said to myself:<br> "You can't do this to Billy. Not this."<br> I ought to thank you, then,<br> didn't I?<br> No. No, no, I'm a human being,<br> that's all. Same as the next man.<br> I want no thanks.<br> I can't help being a coward though.<br> That's my trouble.<br> I hate Claggart.<br> That's what he don't realize.<br> I hate him.<br> - You hate him?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Don't you?<br> No.<br> - You don't?<br> - No.<br> You must do.<br> Why has the old man stopped singing?<br> Get away, old man.<br> Aye, I'll leave you in the dark, Kincaid...<br> ...but think again.<br> Well, even though<br> you don't hate him, Billy...<br> ...there's many as does,<br> and they need your help.<br> They came to me and they said,<br> "Do you think Billy'll help us?"<br> I said, "Well, I've never known him<br> not to help them in need."<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Tomorrow night...<br> ...talk to Claggart as you did tonight,<br> with his back to the deck.<br> Now, that's important.<br> - The lads will do the rest.<br> - The rest?<br> That's a lovely knife you got there.<br> What...?<br> Damn. I don't know what you mean.<br> Forget I even talked to you.<br> - You better go back where you belong.<br> - Yeah, I'm going.<br> If you don't start,<br> I'll toss you back over the rail.<br> I never said nothing.<br> - Well?<br> - Well, what?<br> I heard you muttering with him<br> down by the forechains.<br> I tried something new,<br> something you once suggested.<br> I told him some of the lads was out<br> to kill you and tried to get him to join in.<br> - And?<br> - He wouldn't do it.<br> Fool. Blithering idiot.<br> You didn't tempt him right.<br> You made mistakes.<br> - No.<br> - You were too obvious.<br> - Weren't you?<br> - No, I did as you suggested.<br> I tried to be subtle.<br> I told him<br> how much I hated you.<br> He didn't let forth one hint<br> that he agreed with you?<br> No, sir. No, master-at-arms.<br> Not one word.<br> Mr. Claggart, we done enough to him.<br> He's a good lad, sir.<br> Couldn't it be someone else?<br> Kincaid, maybe?<br> So he's softened your heart too, huh?<br> I'll see your back laid raw<br> with the flogging whip.<br> - No. No.<br> - Quiet.<br> Yeah.<br> He hates you, does Billy Budd.<br> He wants your life<br> like the rest of them.<br> You swear it?<br> I swear it...<br> ...on my oath.<br> I knew it.<br> Why don't you go to Mr. Seymour...<br> ...or to the captain?<br> Then I'd be an informer.<br> No, no, Dansker, I can't.<br> It's Kincaid.<br> Leave him be.<br> - No.<br> - Leave him be, Billy Budd.<br> Kincaid.<br> What are you doing topside?<br> You're after Mr. Claggart.<br> - Well?<br> - It's wrong, Kincaid. He knows.<br> - He's waiting for you.<br> - No more than I'm waiting for him.<br> Get out of my way, lad,<br> and let me do it.<br> No, I won't let you hang yourself.<br> I don't give a fiddler's damn<br> what happens to me.<br> Out of my way, lad.<br> Give me that knife.<br> Billy, you're a nice boy,<br> but I'm not playing.<br> This is no game for boys.<br> Damn me, I won't let you hang yourself.<br> The moon's under now.<br> Sweet mother of God,<br> will you let me go?<br> No.<br> Oh, my back.<br> Explain this.<br> It was nothing, sir.<br> - An argument.<br> - An argument?<br> - Whose knife is this?<br> - Mine, sir.<br> Truth, boy.<br> Truth.<br> Isn't that the course<br> by which you steer?<br> Or am I wrong?<br> That's not the way it happened.<br> That's what you told captain<br> when Jenkins slipped from carelessness.<br> There are many ways to lie,<br> Mr. Claggart.<br> But there is only one way<br> to tell the truth.<br> Jenkins was unfit.<br> Unfit?<br> Well, here's another one that's unfit.<br> Up man. On your feet.<br> I've been expecting you, Kincaid.<br> Why did you try to stop him?<br> Why should I want you...?<br> Killed?<br> "Why should I want you killed?"<br> What's the disturbance there?<br> You there, forward.<br> - Master-at-arms reports all in order, sir.<br> - Stand where you are.<br> Say nothing to this officer.<br> Come on, up. On your feet.<br> What's the matter, master-at-arms?<br> It's an odd hour for stargazing.<br> A slight matter, sir.<br> I found these men together here on deck,<br> contrary to captain's orders.<br> I was sending them below<br> when you called out.<br> Surely there's more to it than that.<br> The story's lame, man. What occurred?<br> Your knife, master-at-arms?<br> William Budd's, sir, I believe.<br> Return it to him.<br> You reported all in order, master-at-arms.<br> I'll take your word for it.<br> Consequently, I do not wish to see<br> either of their names...<br> ...on ship's report tomorrow.<br> - Sir...<br> ...I feel that I...<br> - Either all is in order or it is not.<br> If it is not,<br> I wish to know about it now.<br> There is no reason for these men's names<br> to be on ship's report, sir.<br> Good.<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> Get below.<br> Both of you.<br> Get below.<br> - More sail please, Mr. Ratcliffe.<br> - The glass is falling, sir.<br> Our mission is to join the fleet.<br> More sail, Mr. Ratcliffe.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Morning, master-at-arms.<br> - Battle stations fully manned.<br> - Carry on.<br> With your permission, sir, I would<br> like to speak to you in private.<br> If this is not a matter<br> of grave concern...<br> ...l'd rather...<br> - It is of grave concern, sir.<br> Set the topgallants!<br> Very well.<br> - I'll be in my cabin, Mr. Wyatt.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Well, master-at-arms, be brief<br> if you will. I'm required on deck.<br> Last night, when on my rounds...<br> ...discovering Budd's hammock<br> was unused...<br> ...I combed the ship and found him<br> in conclave with several growlers.<br> Men who, like himself, spread unrest<br> and rebellion among the crew.<br> - Budd spreads rebellion?<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - An accusation, I take it.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Ratcliffe.<br> - Oh, Captain Hallam.<br> - Sir.<br> Would you bring Budd,<br> the captain of the foretop?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> They were collected here,<br> near the lee forechains...<br> ...and when I ordered them below,<br> young Budd and others threatened me...<br> ...and swore they'd drop me<br> and officers they hate overboard...<br> ...on some misty night.<br> Should you desire substantial proof, sir,<br> it is not far.<br> Weigh what you speak.<br> There is the rope and the yardarm<br> for false witness, in peace as in war.<br> - I understand, sir.<br> - I am glad to hear it.<br> - Budd, sir.<br> - Bring him in.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Come in, Budd.<br> Captain, see that we're not disturbed,<br> if you will.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> Tell this man to his face<br> what you told me.<br> Certainly, sir.<br> I said this man, this William Budd...<br> ...acting so out of angry resentment against<br> impressment and against his officers...<br> ...against this ship,<br> this service, and the king...<br> ...heads in the crew a spirit of rebellion<br> against the officers, the mates and me.<br> And urges them<br> to the outrage of mutiny.<br> This very night,<br> I surprised him in the forechain...<br> ...and both saw and heard him<br> conspire with known malingerers...<br> ...and men who continually growl<br> about unfair pay...<br> ...mistreatment, the lack of shore leave,<br> and similar complaints.<br> I have the names of the others involved<br> in this sinister plot. The man Kincaid...<br> ...the old sailor<br> who goes by the name of Dansker...<br> ...and regrettably,<br> my own hitherto trusted corporal.<br> But there is no doubt in my mind...<br> ...that Budd is their ringleader.<br> I say this man<br> threatened his officers with murder...<br> ...and was bent tonight in urging<br> other men to act concertedly in mutiny.<br> I have nothing further to say<br> at this time, sir.<br> Speak, Budd.<br> - Defend yourself, Budd.<br> - I'm...<br> Take your time.<br> Take your time, there's no hurry.<br> May I add, sir...<br> ...I am as surprised as you seem to be<br> at Budd's complicity in this...<br> ...as I'd hitherto shared<br> your high opinion of him.<br> Give the lad his chance.<br> You've made your accusation.<br> It's up to him to defend himself.<br> - With all due respect, sir...<br> - Mr. Claggart.<br> - I don't think he can.<br> It's not so much<br> that he can't find the words...<br> ...as that there are no words to find.<br> - Mr. Claggart, I told you...!<br> Ca... Captain.<br> Seymour?<br> Go in there until I call you.<br> - Captain Hallam.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Forgive me for imposing<br> upon you again.<br> Do you think you could<br> call the surgeon to come?<br> The surgeon, sir?<br> - I do hope, sir, that you are not...<br> - No, no.<br> - Nothing.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> I trust I find you in good health.<br> How is it with this man?<br> Is it so, then?<br> I thought it.<br> - Verify it.<br> - The man is dead, sir.<br> - But is that possible? One blow?<br> - Temple.<br> I've known the largest men<br> to have thin skulls.<br> This might have happened at any time<br> and for any reason.<br> Ratcliffe.<br> What?<br> Why the drumhead court-martial?<br> Couldn't the prisoner be guarded?<br> The matter referred to the Admiralty<br> when we reach port?<br> When we reach port? We do not<br> sail to port, we sail into battle...<br> ...and battle makes a mockery of justice.<br> No, we must cling to what<br> vestiges of order we can.<br> - It must be done quickly.<br> - Quickly?<br> Since when is justice<br> compatible with speed?<br> You realize that we were spared mutiny<br> aboard this ship...<br> ...simply because we were not in port.<br> But the men know. They know.<br> Rumors fly over the empty sea<br> and with them...<br> ...the temper of the times we live in.<br> And so we are afraid?<br> Justice must be not only quick<br> but also expedient.<br> What did you say?<br> I apologize, sir, for the manner,<br> not for the matter.<br> Claggart would've hung for false witness<br> if Billy hadn't killed him.<br> Yes, he would have done,<br> but by fair process of law.<br> Budd has prevented that,<br> and he's turned the law against himself.<br> You can't condemn the boy for answering<br> with his arm for lack of words.<br> He was tempted beyond endurance.<br> - The motive was clearly justified.<br> - Aye, but was the act?<br> This master-at-arms,<br> you know him for a liar, a vicious dog.<br> A dog's obeyed in office.<br> Claggart was authority.<br> Seymour, a trial there must be.<br> And you cannot make the dead<br> stand trial.<br> So the living must stand trial<br> for a dead man's crimes.<br> It's more than any man<br> can have to answer for, captain...<br> ...to his God, or even to his king.<br> Come in!<br> You all know why<br> you've been summoned here?<br> Aye, sir, in a general sort of way.<br> - Ratcliffe.<br> - You took all precautions, gentlemen?<br> No man aboard knows<br> why you are here?<br> No, sir.<br> Oh, Captain Hallam, the body?<br> It still lies<br> in the compartment below, sir.<br> Nobody saw the men<br> who put it there?<br> No, sir, I made sure of that.<br> Thank you, captain.<br> I've never seen him so disturbed.<br> Aye.<br> I give him cause.<br> Very well, Mr. Seymour.<br> You may proceed.<br> Gentlemen.<br> You are appointed members<br> of a court-martial...<br> ...convened by Captain Vere<br> in extraordinary circumstances.<br> I am senior member...<br> ...and I declare these proceedings open.<br> As you know...<br> ...the master-at-arms has been killed<br> by the foretopman, Budd.<br> Whether by accident or by design...<br> ...and whether the act<br> shall carry the penalty of death or no...<br> ...you are to decide.<br> - Sentry.<br> - Sir.<br> Bring the prisoner in.<br> There is only one witness,<br> Captain Vere.<br> I shall call on him to give his deposition<br> as soon as the sentry brings in the prisoner.<br> - Sentry, stand outside.<br> - Sir.<br> You may sit down, Billy.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Captain, will you be good enough<br> to give us your account.<br> I speak to you not as your captain,<br> but as a witness before this court.<br> The master-at-arms, early this morning,<br> detailed to me...<br> ...an account of mutinous sentiments<br> expressed by Budd...<br> ...and spoke of overhearing a specific<br> conversation last night during mid-watch.<br> - Budd a mutineer? That's absurd.<br> - Lt. Wyatt.<br> - He's one of the best liked...<br> - Lt. Wyatt, do not interrupt the witness.<br> And now, sir, with your permission.<br> Budd...<br> ...did you speak with anyone<br> in the master-at-arms' hearing last night?<br> I spoke a little with the Dansker, sir.<br> - The sailmaker?<br> - Sentry.<br> Sir.<br> Do you know a seaman<br> referred to as the Dansker?<br> Sir.<br> Go on deck and find him.<br> Let him know apart he is wanted here.<br> And arrange it so that none of<br> the other people notice his withdrawing.<br> See you do it tactfully.<br> I want no curiosity aroused<br> among the men.<br> Sir.<br> Will you go on, sir, please?<br> I sent at once for Budd.<br> I ordered the master-at-arms<br> to be present at this interview...<br> ...and to repeat his accusations<br> to Budd's face.<br> May I ask what was the prisoner's reaction<br> on being confronted by the master-at-arms?<br> I perceived no uneasiness in his demeanor.<br> I believe he smiled.<br> And for the master-at-arms?<br> When I told him to make his accusations<br> to Budd's face, he faced Budd and did so.<br> Did Budd reply?<br> He tried to,<br> but could not frame his words.<br> And then, sir?<br> He answered with a blow.<br> The accuser fell.<br> It was evident at once<br> the blow was fatal...<br> ...but I summoned the surgeon<br> to verify the fact.<br> That's all.<br> You've heard Captain Vere's account.<br> Is it or is it not as he has said?<br> Captain Vere speaks the truth.<br> It's just as Captain Vere says.<br> But it is not as the master-at-arms said.<br> I've eaten the king's bread<br> and I'm true to him.<br> - I believe you, boy.<br> - God knows, I...<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Was there malice...<br> ...between you and the master-at-arms?<br> I bore no malice<br> against the master-at-arms.<br> I'm sorry that he's dead.<br> I did not mean to kill him.<br> If I'd have found my tongue,<br> I would not have struck him.<br> But he lied foully to my face, and I had...<br> Well, I had to say something.<br> I could only say it with a blow.<br> God help me.<br> Anybody seen Mr. Claggart about?<br> Well, he was not at the inspection.<br> You'd better not let him catch you<br> lying around like this.<br> You have been summoned<br> in secrecy...<br> ...to appear before this court<br> as a witness...<br> ...of which I am senior member.<br> I may not, at this time, disclose to you<br> the nature of the offense being tried.<br> However, the offender<br> is William Budd, foretopman.<br> Do you consent to give this court<br> your testimony...<br> ...though ignorant of the case at trial,<br> and further...<br> ...to keep in strictest confidence<br> all that passes here?<br> Aye.<br> Do you so swear?<br> I do.<br> Then this is my question:<br> In your opinion...<br> ...is there malice<br> between the master-at-arms and Budd?<br> Aye.<br> Explain your statement.<br> Master-at-arms bore malice...<br> ...towards a grace...<br> ...he could not have.<br> There was no reason for it...<br> ...that ordinary men could understand.<br> Pride was his demon.<br> And he kept it strong<br> by others' fear of him.<br> He was a Pharisee among the lepers.<br> Billy could not understand<br> such a nature.<br> He saw only a lonely man, strange...<br> ...but a man still.<br> Nothing to be feared.<br> So Claggart...<br> ...lest his world be proven false...<br> ...planned Billy's death.<br> I notice in your testimony<br> you've been using the past tense.<br> Why?<br> I look around...<br> ...and sense finality here.<br> - Have you any more questions?<br> - One thing more.<br> Ever since this master-at-arms<br> came aboard...<br> ...from God knows where...<br> ...I have seen his shadow<br> lengthen along the deck.<br> And being under it...<br> ...I was afraid.<br> Whatever happened here...<br> ...I am in part to blame.<br> Have you any further questions<br> to put to the accused?<br> - None.<br> - No.<br> William Budd...<br> ...if you have anything further<br> to say for yourself...<br> ...say it now.<br> I've said all, sir.<br> Sentry.<br> - Sir.<br> - Remove the prisoner to my compartment.<br> Have you anything to say, Ratcliffe?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Claggart was killed<br> because Budd couldn't speak.<br> In that sense, that he stammers,<br> he's a cripple.<br> You don't hang a man for that,<br> for speaking the only way he could.<br> If you condemn him, it's the same...<br> ...as condoning the lie<br> the master-at-arms clearly told.<br> I'd have struck him myself.<br> The boy is clearly innocent,<br> struck in self-defense.<br> - Aye. I'm ready to acquit him now.<br> - Good, then we can reach a verdict at once.<br> One moment, gentlemen.<br> With your pardon, sir,<br> as senior member of this court...<br> ...I must ask if you speak now<br> as our commanding officer...<br> ...or as a private individual.<br> As convening authority, Seymour,<br> I summoned this court.<br> I must review its findings and approve them<br> before passing them to the Admiralty.<br> - Aye, sir, that is your right.<br> - No right.<br> Which one of us here has rights?<br> It's my duty, and I must perform it.<br> Budd killed a man, his superior officer.<br> We've found a verdict, sir.<br> I know you have, and your verdict<br> sets him free, and so would I wish to do.<br> But are we free to choose<br> as we would if we were private citizens?<br> The Admiralty has its code.<br> Do you think it cares who Budd is?<br> Who you and I are?<br> We don't forget that, sir, but surely even<br> within that code, each crime is different.<br> We can't ignore the facts.<br> The facts. Come, you know the facts,<br> which are the Mutiny Act's provisions.<br> At sea, in time of war,<br> an impressed man...<br> ...strikes his superior officer<br> and the blow is fatal.<br> Now, according to the Act...<br> ...the mere fact of the blow<br> would be enough to hang him...<br> ...be it fatal or no.<br> Now, the men know this<br> as well as you and I.<br> They know the penalty<br> for Budd's action.<br> But they know Budd, sir.<br> Claggart too, I dare say.<br> As well as any dry letter of the law.<br> They would applaud<br> the decision that frees Budd.<br> They'd thank us for it.<br> Fight the better when the time comes.<br> String him to a yard,<br> they'll turn round and rescue him.<br> - And string us up instead.<br> - Aye, that's the point.<br> It's twice as dangerous to hang the boy<br> as to let him go.<br> Yes, that's possible, Ratcliffe.<br> Whatever step we take,<br> the risk is great, but it is ours.<br> That is what makes us officers.<br> If by our lawful rigor mutiny comes,<br> there is no blame for us.<br> But if in fear,<br> miscalled a kind of mercy...<br> ...we pardon Budd against specific order<br> and then the men revolt...<br> ...how culpable and weak<br> our verdict will appear.<br> I can see that, sir.<br> But this case is exceptional.<br> And pity, if we are men,<br> must move us, captain.<br> So am I moved, Ratcliffe.<br> But we cannot have warm hearts<br> betraying heads which should be cool.<br> Officers are only men in uniform.<br> We have our standards,<br> ethics, scruples.<br> Challenge your scruples.<br> Come, do they mean something like this?<br> Can we adjudge to summary<br> and shameful death...<br> ...a fellow creature<br> we believe to be innocent before God?<br> - Does that state your case rightly?<br> - That is my feeling, sir.<br> - Acquit him, then you say, as innocent.<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, I know the Articles prescribe death<br> for what Budd has done...<br> Stow the Articles. They don't account<br> for such a case as this.<br> You've said yourself, sir,<br> Budd is innocent.<br> In a court more merciful than a martial one,<br> our views might count.<br> - They might even set him free.<br> - Sir, when Claggart told you his lies...<br> ...the case immediately went beyond<br> military justice.<br> There, Seymour, you reveal<br> the whole weakness of your argument.<br> Here, nothing is beyond the scope<br> of military justice.<br> When we first put this on,<br> we resigned our freedom.<br> The gold we wear<br> shows that we serve the king...<br> ...the law.<br> For the term of my active life,<br> I am bound by an oath I took...<br> ...when I was half the age<br> of any of you here.<br> And now, for the first time in my life,<br> I feel the weight of those words...<br> ...I spoke so solemnly as a midshipman,<br> ignorant of their meaning...<br> ...with nothing but dreams of glory<br> in my mind.<br> Yes, but...<br> ...gentlemen, you took that oath as well.<br> There's no escape.<br> All I know is that I can't sit by<br> and see an innocent man hanged.<br> - Who'd gain by Budd's death? Admiralty?<br> - You want to make us murderers.<br> What is this ship you serve in?<br> An ark of peace? Go count her guns...<br> ...then tell your conscience to lie quiet,<br> if you can.<br> But that is war.<br> This will be downright killing.<br> It's all war, Ratcliffe.<br> War to the death for all of us.<br> Oh, you see that, Seymour?<br> That this war...<br> ...began before our time?<br> - And will end long after it.<br> - Aye...<br> ...if ever men deserve to be at peace.<br> Couldn't we...<br> ...mitigate the penalty<br> if we find him guilty?<br> No, Ratcliffe,<br> the penalty is prescribed.<br> I'd like to think about it, captain.<br> I'm not sure.<br> The French are not far off.<br> Soon the men will know what happened.<br> Our consciences are private matters,<br> Ratcliffe, but we are public men.<br> Dare we give our consciences precedence<br> over the code that made us officers?<br> And which called this case to trial?<br> Dare we?<br> No, sir.<br> Can you stand Budd's murder<br> on your conscience?<br> Wyatt, hold your tongue.<br> - I say let him go.<br> - Sit down, sir.<br> I won't bear a hand<br> to hang an innocent man.<br> My blood's not cold enough for that.<br> I cannot give the kind of judgment<br> that you wish to force upon us.<br> I beg to be excused<br> from sitting upon this court-martial.<br> Wyatt...<br> ...we do not deal with justice here,<br> but with the law.<br> Was not the one conceived<br> to serve the other?<br> Wyatt, can't you see that you must<br> first strip off the uniform you wear...<br> ...and then your flesh before you can<br> escape the case at issue here?<br> Decide you must, Wyatt...<br> ...or else reason with us.<br> Show us how to save the boy<br> without setting aside our function.<br> You think Seymour, Ratcliffe and I<br> wouldn't save the boy...<br> ...if we could find a way<br> consistent with our duty?<br> Well, perhaps you can do this.<br> Can you do this?<br> Speak, man.<br> Speak.<br> Show us how.<br> Save him, Wyatt, and you save us all.<br> Do not think me pitiless<br> in thus demanding sentence...<br> ...on a luckless boy.<br> I feel as you do for him.<br> And for myself...<br> ...revulsion...<br> ...shame...<br> ...and rage.<br> Is there hope for me, captain?<br> Billy...<br> ...what hope is there for any of us?<br> Tell me why.<br> I only want to understand.<br> A child, with his endless "whys."<br> "Why are there wars?<br> Why must men kill each other?"<br> A child will ask...<br> ...and the parent will grow impatient<br> believing these questions to be foolish.<br> They're not foolish,<br> they're questions...<br> ...to which grown men<br> have lost the answer.<br> The answer went with innocence.<br> Why?<br> I cannot tell you why.<br> I feel sorry, captain, but not guilty.<br> Nor should you. Claggart killed you<br> the moment you killed him.<br> But I'm still alive.<br> You, in your goodness,<br> are as inhuman...<br> ...as was Claggart in his evil.<br> Well, at least be human now, Billy.<br> Give in to anger for once.<br> Hate me for what I do to you. No...<br> Please, Billy.<br> Promise me your fury and resentment.<br> Hatred will make you<br> conquer your fear.<br> I'm not afraid, sir.<br> I did my duty. You're doing yours.<br> Sentry.<br> Take Budd into your charge.<br> Merryweather.<br> Time to get up, Budd.<br> Marine detachment. Attention!<br> - Marine detachment present and correct, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Over there. Mr. Seymour.<br> Ship's company, form ranks!<br> Come on, move up there.<br> Attention! Division commander's report.<br> Afterguard present or accounted for, sir.<br> Starboard battery<br> present or accounted for, sir.<br> Larboard battery<br> present and accounted for, sir.<br> Fore-, main-, and mizzentopmen,<br> five working party...<br> ...one absentee, sir.<br> One absentee.<br> All hands will stand by<br> to witness punishment.<br> Stand easy.<br> Who could they be punishing?<br> And what for?<br> It's got to be a flogging.<br> I ought to know.<br> But why have they kept us<br> off the catwalks?<br> They flog men at noon.<br> The early morning...<br> ...is for a hanging.<br> - Hanging?<br> - Hanging.<br> Hanging?<br> Where's Ferguson? Where's Billy?<br> And Turner.<br> Aye, Morrison too.<br> There were four hammocks<br> empty last night.<br> - That will be the working party.<br> - But there's five in the working party.<br> One absentee.<br> Hey...<br> ...where's Claggart?<br> - Well, you don't suppose it's him, do you?<br> - Oh, Judas, let it be that fish-blooded...<br> - Not him.<br> He's too smart, he is.<br> Where's Squeak, come to that?<br> Well, he'll be with Claggart.<br> Why isn't Claggart here?<br> He is here.<br> Where? I don't see him.<br> He is here.<br> You're barmy, old man.<br> Ship's company, attention!<br> Marine detachment, attention!<br> Ship's company<br> present to witness execution, sir.<br> Very well.<br> Ship's company<br> ready to witness execution, sir.<br> Captain Hallam.<br> Escort, bring forward the prisoner.<br> - Billy!<br> - Billy.<br> - They can't, Bill.<br> - They've got old Billy.<br> No talking in the ranks.<br> - They'll pay for this.<br> - Steady, mate. Steady.<br> Form up.<br> Do you hear me? Silence in ranks.<br> Escort.<br> I'm sorry, Billy.<br> Come on, keep moving.<br> Keep silent there.<br> Proceedings of the court-martial<br> held aboard HMS Avenger...<br> ...on the 28th August, 1797...<br> ...convened under the authority...<br> ...of Edwin Fairfax Vere,<br> post captain, royal navy...<br> ...and composed of the first, second<br> and third lieutenants of said vessel.<br> The case of William Budd,<br> foretopman, royal navy.<br> While attached and so serving<br> the aforesaid vessel...<br> ...he did, on the 28th day<br> of August, 1797...<br> ...strike and kill his superior officer...<br> ...one John Claggart, master-at-arms...<br> - Did you, Billy?<br> Quiet!<br> Silence, you men! Form up!<br> Stand to attention there, hang you!<br> Silence in the ranks!<br> You will be silent and remain<br> at strict attention until dismissed!<br> - Master-at-arms, royal navy.<br> Therefore, the court sentences<br> the aforementioned...<br> ...William Budd, foretopman,<br> royal navy...<br> ...to die by hanging on the first watch<br> following these proceedings.<br> Don't worry, Billy.<br> Do you hear, sir?<br> By authority of His gracious<br> Majesty George Rex...<br> ...and Alan Napier, Viscount Kelsey,<br> First Sea Lord.<br> Signed...<br> ...Philip Seymour, senior member.<br> Let them dance on a rope's end!<br> You're not hanging Billy Budd!<br> Silence!<br> You will resume discipline instantly!<br> Be warned!<br> For the last time, you scum,<br> will you obey orders?<br> Stand back into ranks.<br> Resume your ranks there<br> and be quick about it!<br> Prisoner...<br> ...have you anything to say?<br> If you have nothing to say,<br> the sentence of the court will be carried out.<br> God bless Captain Vere.<br> Sound off!<br> Marines, cover the hanging party!<br> No, Billy!<br> Permission to dismiss the men, sir.<br> Permission to dismiss the men, sir.<br> Sir?<br> You may do as you wish, Mr. Seymour.<br> It's of no further concern to me.<br> Sir, a decision must be made.<br> A decision has been made,<br> Mr. Ratcliffe.<br> I'm only a man,<br> not fit to do the work of God...<br> ...or the devil.<br> Ship's company.<br> Ship's company, by divisions, dismiss!<br> Afterguard dismissed.<br> Starboard battery dismissed.<br> Larboard battery dismissed.<br> Fore-, main-, and mizzentopmen dismissed.<br> Repeat the order!<br> Captain Hallam, fire into their ranks.<br> Marines, take aim.<br> Beat to quarters!<br> Clear decks for action!<br> Come on, lads, let's punish the French<br> for turning up late!<br> The rest belongs to naval history.<br> But if the sacrifice of Billy Budd...<br> ... has served to make men<br> more conscious of justice...<br> ... then he will not have died in vain.<br> Men are perishable things...<br> ... but justice will live<br> as long as the human soul...<br> ... and the law,<br> as long as the human mind.<br>
