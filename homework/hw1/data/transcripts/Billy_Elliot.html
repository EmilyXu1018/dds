They won't last long.<br> Tom, don't.<br> If they voted, they'd be back tomorrow.<br> It's just a few commies, stirring things up.<br> Let's face it,<br> they haven't got a leg to stand on.<br> Who doesn't?<br> The miners.<br> It stands to reason.<br> Some pits are just uneconomical.<br> If it costs more to pay everybody<br> to dig the coal out...<br> ...than you get for it when you sell it,<br> what does that say?<br> I don't know.<br> You wanna think about that,<br> don't you, son?<br> Tom.<br> If it was up to me,<br> I'd shut them all down tomorrow.<br> For God's sake.<br> What do you do, Mr. Wilkinson?<br> He's been made redundant.<br> - I thought he was gonna hit me.<br> - Don't be silly.<br> He's just under a lot of pressure.<br> That's what Mom says.<br> I think it's because he drinks too much.<br> Does he drink too much?<br> He's always pissed.<br> Once he pissed himself.<br> Your dad?<br> 'Cause he's unhappy and that.<br> 'Cause they sleep in separate beds.<br> - Why do they sleep in separate beds?<br> - So they can't have sex.<br> Do they not have sex?<br> Dad did it with this woman from work,<br> but they don't think I know.<br> Do you miss your mom, then?<br> I don't really miss her as such.<br> It's more like just feeling sad.<br> Especially when I remember her<br> all of a sudden.<br> When I'd forgot that she was dead<br> and that.<br> What about your mom?<br> Does she not have sex?<br> No, she's unfulfilled.<br> That's why she does dancing.<br> She does dancing instead of sex?<br> - Your family's weird.<br> - No, they're not.<br> They are though. They're mental.<br> Get off!<br> See? You're a nutter, you.<br> Debbie, it's time for Billy to go home.<br> Come on, Billy.<br> I'll drop you off at the corner.<br> I'll see you, Debbie.<br> Okay, then.<br> Miss...<br> ...what have I blown?<br> This'll sound strange, Billy...<br> ...but, for some time now,<br> I've thought of the Royal Ballet School.<br> Aren't you a bit old?<br> No, not me. You.<br> I'm the bloody teacher.<br> They hold auditions in Newcastle.<br> I'd never be good enough.<br> I hardly know aught.<br> They're not interested<br> in how much you know.<br> They'll teach you.<br> That's why they're a ballet school.<br> It's how you move,<br> how you express yourself that's important.<br> Express what?<br> I think you're good enough to go for it.<br> It would mean an awful lot of hard work.<br> But I'm banned.<br> - Maybe I should have a word with him.<br> - No, Miss!<br> - I could teach you on your own.<br> - We couldn't afford it.<br> - I'm not doing it for the money.<br> - What about Dad?<br> - He doesn't need to know.<br> - What about boxing?<br> Listen, if you wanna piss about<br> with your mates, that's fine with me.<br> All right, don't lose your blob.<br> "Blob"?<br> So, we could do it private like?<br> Just you and me.<br> Miss, you don't fancy me, do you?<br> No, Billy. Funnily enough, I don't.<br> Now, piss off.<br> Piss off yourself.<br> See you Monday, then.<br> You coming in or what?<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Nothing. Just dressing up.<br> - Whose dress is that?<br> - Come on.<br> - Whose dress is that?<br> - It's me sister's.<br> - Did she give you it?<br> - She doesn't know.<br> Do you wanna try?<br> You can have one of me mom's.<br> No. You all right?<br> - What are you doing that for?<br> - I'm just trying it on.<br> Christ.<br> Come here.<br> Stay still.<br> There.<br> - Won't we get in trouble?<br> - Don't be stupid.<br> Me dad does it all the time.<br> He dresses up in your mom's clothes?<br> Only when he thinks everybody's out.<br> Have you got a tutu yet?<br> Do you think being a ballet dancer<br> would be better than being a miner?<br> I don't know.<br> It's just, I've got this audition<br> in Newcastle, in a couple of weeks.<br> - What for?<br> - To go to ballet school.<br> Ballet school?

It's only a stupid audition.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Fuck off.<br> - There's always next year.<br> - Look, fuck off, will you?<br> You bent bastard!<br> What on earth's going on here?<br> How did it go?<br> Shit!<br> Mr. Elliot, I'm afraid that mutual respect<br> and self-discipline...<br> ...are absolute prerequisites<br> for any pupil in this school.<br> Such displays of violence...<br> ...cannot be tolerated<br> under any circumstances. Understand?<br> I realize we shall have to consider<br> this very seriously...<br> ...and it will be bound to affect<br> our final decision.<br> Yes, well, just a few questions, then.<br> Can you tell us why you first<br> became interested in the ballet?<br> Don't know.<br> Just was.<br> Well, was there any particular aspect<br> of the ballet, which...<br> ...caught your imagination?<br> The dancing.<br> He dances all the time.<br> Every night, after school.<br> Yes, well,<br> we have a very enthusiastic letter from...<br> ...Mrs. Wilkinson, and she has...<br> ...told us of your personal circumstances.<br> Mr. Elliot, are you a fan of the ballet?<br> I wouldn't exactly say I was an expert.<br> You do realize that...<br> ...all pupils must attain<br> the highest standards, not just in ballet...<br> ...but in their ordinary academic work?<br> No child can succeed without<br> the 100 percent support of the family.<br> You are completely behind Billy?<br> Are you not?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Do you want to ask us any questions?<br> No, not really. No.<br> In that case...<br> ...we shall let you know in due course.<br> Just one last question.<br> Can I ask you, Billy:<br> What does it feel like when you're dancing?<br> Don't know.<br> Sort of feels good.<br> It's sort of stiff and that...<br> ...but once I get going...<br> ...then I, like, forget everything...<br> ...and...<br> ...sort of disappear.<br> I sort of disappear.<br> Like I feel a change in me whole body.<br> Like there's a fire in me body.<br> I'm just there...<br> ...flying...<br> ...like a bird.<br> Like electricity.<br> Yeah...<br> ...like electricity.<br> Have a safe journey home.<br> Mr. Elliot.<br> Good luck with the strike.<br> Toast.<br> I think you should get yourself a trade, son.<br> Something useful.<br> I could have been a professional dancer.<br> What's happened to the dinosaurs, Miss?<br> They were crushed as well.<br> And the pressure of all of this<br> caused the plants and trees to change...<br> ...into coal.<br> That's what must have happened to her.<br> Michael Caffrey,<br> if you have got something to say...<br> ...you can say it to the class.<br> Sorry, Miss.<br> So, gradually...<br> ...over hundreds of thousands of years...<br> Post!<br> This is it.<br> - Have you heard anything yet?<br> - Not yet.<br> You'll have no problem, man.<br> Fingers crossed, eh?<br> I got in.<br> He did it! He fucking did it!<br> Jackie, have you not heard, man?<br> We're going back.<br> Strike's over, Jackie.<br> The union caved in yesterday.<br> I think I'm scared, Dad.<br> That's okay, son.<br> We're all scared.<br> Well, if I don't like it, can I still come back?<br> Are you kidding?<br> We've let out your room.<br> Four, five, six, seven, eight.<br> And one, two, three, four...<br> ...five, six, seven.<br> Keep going, girls.<br> Miss, I just came to tell you.<br> It's all right, Billy, I heard it from Debbie.<br> Look, it was just...<br> Well, you know, after everything.<br> - I'll miss you, Miss.<br> - No, you won't.<br> I will. Honest.<br> This is when you go out and find life...<br> ...and all those other things.<br> The best of luck, Billy.<br> Right. Back to the bar, girls. And again.<br> Thank you.<br> Debbie, eyes front.<br> - Was she there?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You'll miss the bus.<br> - I'll take it.<br> - Give us the bag.<br> - Okay, right, no time for this.<br> Come on, I'll take that.<br> - Good-bye, Billy.<br> - See you.<br> Dancing boy!<br> - You'll miss your bus, Billy.<br> - Stop being an old fucking woman.<br> See you, then.<br> - I'll miss you!<br> - What? I can't hear you!<br> Dad, come on, man. We're gonna be late.<br> Come on!<br> The show's just started.<br> Excuse me.<br> Can you tell Billy Elliot<br> that his family's here?<br> - Sorry, mate.<br> - It's all right, Tony.<br> It's me, Michael. Remember?<br> It's Michael.<br> - What the bloody hell are you doing here?<br> - I wouldn't have missed it for the world.<br> Stand by, please.<br> - Billy, your family are here.<br> - Thanks.<br>
