                        You will see all the<br> man-made and natural beauties<br> of the most spectacular bay in the world.<br> You'll pass beneath<br> the famous Golden Gate Bridge,<br> considered to be one of the most<br> striking structures ever erected by man.<br> From the bay, you will thrill<br> to the magnificent San Francisco skyline.<br> Your cruise ship, the Harbour King,<br> will circle Alcatraz,<br> a maximum-security prison containing<br> the most dangerous criminals in America,<br> and has been the home of such<br> notorious figures as Al Capone,<br> Baby Face Nelson<br> and Machine Gun Kelly.<br> That's the island of Alcatraz.<br> There's a man leaving there today<br> after 17 years' imprisonment.<br> His name is Robert Stroud.<br> He's spent most of his life behind bars,<br> including 43 years<br> in solitary confinement.<br> He has never used a telephone<br> or driven an automobile.<br> The last time he broke bread<br> with another human being was in 1916,<br> the year Kaiser Wilhelm ordered the<br> sinking of the Lusitania in World War I.<br> My name is Tom Gaddis.<br> I wrote a book about this man.<br> Our story<br> properly begins in the year 1912.<br> A cargo of rebellious prisoners<br> was being transferred<br> from the federal penitentiary at McNeil<br> Island, Washington, to The Big Top,<br> the name given by convicts<br> to the prison at Leavenworth, Kansas.<br> Shut up!<br> Make one more move<br> and I'll take you off at the neck.<br> Robert F Stroud.<br> Breaking that window<br> was a serious offence.<br> It was hot. I was thinking of my lungs.<br> Did you think about the consequences?<br> You might have started a riot.<br> - Even a convict's got a right to breathe.<br> - Rights?<br> I don't think you know<br> the meaning of the word.<br> In 1909, in Alaska, you appointed yourself<br> judge, jury and executioner<br> and killed one... Charles Dahmer<br> because he allegedly beat up a friend<br> named Katie Malone... a prostitute.<br> You were transferred here to Leavenworth<br> because of an inferior record.<br> Now, I propose to give you a fresh start.<br> Such rights as you will enjoy are listed<br> here in my rules and regulations.<br> There are 86.<br> I suggest you memorise them.<br> I know 'em. They're the same in all pens.<br> They tell you when to eat,<br> when to sleep, when to go to the privy.<br> Precisely. And what you'll do<br> for every minute 24 hours a day.<br> You're going to be here<br> for nine long years, Stroud.<br> So with or without your cooperation,<br> I intend to make a man of you,<br> before you check out these gates.<br> You'll conform to our ideas<br> of how you should behave.<br> You'll learn the lesson now<br> or five years from now, but you'll learn.<br> For breaking that train window, all your<br> privileges are suspended for 30 days.<br> That's all, Mr Ransom.<br> Let's go.<br> You're one of the new fish<br> from McNeil, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, well, I'm Tony Qualen.<br> Who are you?<br> Stroud.<br> You're lucky to be in this cellblock.<br> Boss here's a friend of mine.<br> Picture of your mother?<br> Put it back.<br> Put it back!<br> What did I do?<br> Just don't touch it again.<br> You know the guy<br> you're bunking with? Anthony?<br> Understand you and him<br> had a little misunderstanding.<br> Anthony is a friend of mine.<br> A very good friend.<br> He didn't mean nothin',<br> pickin' up the picture.<br> Beat it.<br> What kind of nut are you anyway? Just<br> because he picked up a picture of Mama?<br> Break it up!<br> Stroud! Stroud!<br> You ever mention<br> my mother again, I'll kill ya!<br> Stroud.<br> What's the matter, man?<br> What's eating you up inside, Bob?<br> You act as though you hate everyone.<br> You live in a pus-hole,<br> you act accordingly.<br> All right, Bob. Maybe 30 days in the hole'll<br> make you happy to see a face again.<br> Don't count on it... Harvey.<br> I don't think 30 days in the hole<br> is gonna cool that jaybird off, Warden.<br> Now, what do you suggest, Mr Kramer?<br> He's as mean as a boar hog.<br> If it was me, I'd keep him away from<br> the rest of the inmates permanently.<br> Isolation? No.<br> I don't give up on a man that easily.<br> Stroud comes from good stock.<br> He'll shape up.<br> He's a dingbat, Warden.<br> He's dangerous.<br> He's my responsibility, Mr Kramer.<br> Now, you let me worry<br> about his behaviour.<br> Yes, sir.<br> All right, Stroud.<br> Dearest Mother. I am feeling fine.<br> Hope you are the same.<br> Everything is OK at this end.<br> Time sure does fly.<br> Yesterday was<br> my fourth anniversary here,<br> but I got no cake. Ha-ha.<br> I guess everything would be all right<br> ifl couldjust see you<br> and give you a great big hug.<br> I hope your cold is better.<br> Your loving son, Robbie.<br> Dearest Robbie.<br> I was here today to see you,<br> but they would not let me in,<br> it being Saturday,<br> with no visiting allowed.<br> But I saw Warden Shoemaker,<br> and he was kind enough<br> to arrange for a visit next Friday.<br> Until then, my darling,<br> this little gift of fruit comes<br> with all my love. Mother.<br> Guard, guard! Mr Kramer!<br> - What do you want?<br> - Did you know my mother was here?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Why didn't you call me?<br> You know the rules.<br> No visitors on Saturday.<br> That all you got in you? Rules?<br> Stop bellyaching. She said she'd be<br> here next week. You can see her then.<br> You ain't got much,<br> but you keep subtracting from it.<br> Don't you know I gotta put you<br> on report for touching a guard?<br> Mr Kramer...<br> If you shoot me on report,<br> I won't get no visit from my mother.<br> You should have thought of that before.<br> She came 2,000 miles.<br> All the way from Alaska.<br> Do me this one favour.<br> I just follow the rules.<br> Now get back to your seat.<br> - I tell you, I got to see her.<br> - And I told you to get back to your seat.<br> You ain't a man, Kramer. You're dog puke.<br> I just came from Kramer's widow.<br> I couldn't look her in the eye, Stroud.<br> I feel responsible for her husband's death.<br> He warned me about you.<br> He told me you were dangerous,<br> but I wouldn't listen.<br> And how he's cold in his grave.<br> You've taken the lives of two people<br> and haven't felt a twinge of conscience.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> Cry? Say I'm sorry?<br> I'm only sorry for Kramer's wife.<br> - And the dead man?<br> - He was fixing to brain me with his club.<br> I protected myself.<br> No remorse, huh?<br> No pity. Just an animal.<br> Ain't that what these cages are for?<br> Animals?<br> I have to make out a report<br> about this killing.<br> I hope it'll help to hang you.<br> Stroud had three trials.<br> The first one was declared a mistrial.<br> In the second, he was sentenced<br> to life imprisonment.<br> He appealed and was granted a third trial.<br> On June 28, 1918,<br> he heard the final verdict.<br> Therefore it is now by the court<br> considered, ordered and adjudged<br> that you be remanded to the custody of<br> the warden of Leavenworth penitentiary<br> and kept in solitary confinement there<br> until the 8th day of November, 1918,<br> and then and there be hanged<br> by the neck until you are dead.<br> No!<br> This sentence is unspeakable!<br> You call this justice?<br> You don't even know<br> the meaning of the word, sir.<br> Forget it. It's "Katy bar the door" for me.<br> I'm done.<br> Sit down, Robbie.<br> Sit down.<br> Look, Ma, you fought,<br> you spent all your money,<br> you got old followin' me from jail to jail.<br> It's time to douse the lights.<br> I told you before, Robbie,<br> I will not let them kill you.<br> I'm going to Washington DC very soon.<br> - I haven't begun to fight.<br> - Time's up.<br> You just don't know how to quit,<br> do you, Ma?<br> Did you think Mother was gonna<br> let them hurt my Robbie?<br> Carrying a petition for clemency,<br> Elizabeth Stroud doggedly haunted<br> the offices of Washington officials,<br> in an effort to gain an audience<br> with the president of the United States.<br> Finally, she managed to see<br> Senator Ham Lewis.<br> He reminded her<br> of the president's grave illness.<br> Grasping at straws,<br> she pleaded with the senator<br> to make an appointment for her<br> with the president's wife.<br> Reluctantly, he agreed.<br> Tell me, Mrs Stroud, why do you think<br> the president should intervene?<br> Mrs Wilson, the president is known<br> as the symbol of compassion<br> throughout the whole world.<br> I'm sure that deep in his heart<br> he doesn't believe in the brutality<br> of an eye for an eye.<br> I've never seen your husband,<br> but I've seen pictures of him.<br> He has the face of a man<br> who has known great suffering.<br> I think he'd understand what it means<br> to have the pack yapping at his heels.<br> Mrs Wilson, they've turned on<br> your husband in his fight for peace.<br> - They've broken his heart.<br> - Mrs Stroud, please.<br> There's only one man left in the world<br> who can lend a helping hand to my son,<br> and that's the president.<br> Take the petition to him.<br> I assure you, I give you my solemn oath,<br> my son is a person of worth.<br> Save him.<br> Stroud! Listen!<br> Hey, do you hear that, you cons?<br> President Wilson commuted Stroud to life!<br> Well, I'll be damned. She pulled it off.<br> Been expecting you, Harvey.<br> I have a telegram here from Washington.<br> You probably know about it.<br> I've heard.<br> I think you will live to regret<br> that this wire ever came.<br> How come?<br> Because you're going to spend<br> the rest of your life in deep-lock.<br> - Who says so?<br> - The attorney general.<br> Remember the judge's sentence?<br> "And kept in solitary confinement<br> until you are hanged by the neck."<br> But that ain't what the judge meant.<br> That's what the attorney general<br> says he meant.<br> Look around you, Stroud.<br> This is going to be your home<br> for as long as you live.<br> Ain't much more<br> you can do to me, is there?<br> A few things.<br> Consider this. You will not be permitted<br> to associate with the other prisoners,<br> not even to exercise with them.<br> You'll eat all your meals alone<br> for the rest of your life.<br> Visiting and corresponding privileges<br> will be limited to your immediate family.<br> And there'll be no work. Nothing to do<br> but count the hours and days and years.<br> They're tearin' down my gallows.<br> - To my great regret.<br> - Yeah.<br> It must have galled you<br> to give that order, Harv.<br> I think I got you figured out, Shoemaker.<br> First day here you as much as asked me<br> to get down on my knees and whimper.<br> I wouldn't do it then and I won't do it now.<br> I won't lick your hand<br> and that's what eats you, keeper.<br> You keep this in mind.<br> A man ain't whipped until he quits.<br> And I'll never give you that pleasure.<br> Now get outta here.<br> I'll never forget you as long as I live.<br> No matter what happens to me,<br> no matter where I am,<br> if I ever get a chance<br> to punish you further, I'll do it.<br> Drop in from time to time.<br> See how long I stick around.<br> I don't have to drop in on you.<br> I'll always know where you are.<br> Being in solitary<br> is like being on rails.<br> A man pushes your food<br> through the door.<br> You eat alone.<br> Once a week you get a shower.<br> You walk in the bullpen.<br> Once a month an inmate comes<br> and cuts your hair.<br> You read.<br> You pace your cell.<br> Once a week you get clean laundry.<br> You pace your cell.<br> The routine's always the same.<br> The only way you can break it<br> is to go on sick call.<br> You sit and listen to your heartbeat,<br> and you hear your life ticking away.<br> The thing that swells in your head<br> until you lose your mind<br> is you know absolutely for sure<br> what's coming next.<br> Here's that Argosy magazine<br> you wanted, Shorty.<br> Thanks, Bull.<br> Do you want anything to read, Stroud?<br> I want something from you, I'll ask for it.<br> Stroud! Get in outta the rain, you nut!<br> You're all gut, you little runt.<br> Hey, Stroud, what ya doin'<br> up there on the ceiling?<br> - Collecting beetles and cockroaches.<br> - I see.<br> Beetles and cockroaches.<br> Poor old Stroud. He's goin' bugs.<br> Gettin' pretty big now, huh?<br> About time for you to fly.<br> Ok, kid, hop to it.<br> Well, go ahead, fly.<br> Well, come on, Runty, fly.<br> What's the matter?<br> A little chicken-hearted?<br> All right, come on, you little punk. Fly!<br> What are you gonna do when it's time to<br> go south for the winter? Walk to Mexico?<br> Hm.<br> All right, kid. Now give it a try.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Come on, Runt. Come on, fly.<br> Here. Come on.<br> Come here. Come on.<br> Come on!<br> - What's the matter with you, anyway?<br> - He'll never get off the ground.<br> That bird's yellow to the core.<br> You gonna be a quitter? Hm?<br> Now you fly, you little punk, or I'll throw<br> you out on your ear, you hear me?<br> Fly!<br> Fly!<br> Yellow, huh?<br> Cold?<br> About six months<br> after Stroud picked up the sparrow,<br> the biggest piece of news<br> a penitentiary can get<br> went through Leavenworth<br> like a forest fire.<br> A new warden had been appointed.<br> West.<br> Rather.<br> Sacourivitch.<br> Hollister.<br> Stroud.<br> Warden, can I have a minute of your time?<br> I mean you, Warden Younger.<br> I'd like you to watch something.<br> Ok, Runty.<br> That's it.<br> Come on, come on. Open it, open it.<br> Open it.<br> Open up. Go ahead.<br> Open it.<br> Go ahead. That's it.<br> That's it.<br> I've never seen anything<br> like that in my life.<br> Where did you get that bird?<br> Found him in the exercise yard, sir.<br> Just put your finger on his feet.<br> - What kind of a bird is that?<br> - A sparrow.<br> It must have taken great patience<br> to train him. I admire that.<br> Then I can keep him, sir?<br> I don't see why not. Do you?<br> You're the warden now, Jess.<br> It's up to you.<br> I think it'll be permitted.<br> Don't take advantage, Stroud.<br> I wouldn't think of it, sir.<br> - There is one thing.<br> - Yes?<br> - I need some birdseed.<br> - Birdseed?<br> Yes.<br> I doubt if we've got any in the warehouse.<br> I took the liberty of ordering some.<br> It's at the post office.<br> I need your permission<br> to have it released.<br> I like your nerve. You'll get your order.<br> Thank you.<br> Trained sparrows in solitary!<br> Pretty cute act you put on there.<br> Just amusing myself.<br> Still ignoring prison regulations,<br> aren't you?<br> I hear you're going to Washington to plan<br> a new Federal Bureau of Prisons.<br> Yes, I am.<br> Every pen run by the book, huh?<br> If you mean uniformity, you're right.<br> - Drop me a postcard, Harv.<br> - I plan to keep in touch.<br> - You did middlin', Runty. Middlin'.<br> - Middling?<br> He just saved your carcass, that's all.<br> Got the heart of an eagle.<br> When Younger allowed Stroud to keep<br> the sparrow, he opened the barn door.<br> Other inmates had relatives<br> send them canaries,<br> and the solitary block rang with song.<br> Then one prisoner became bored with his<br> two canaries, and gave them to Stroud.<br> That was a day penal authorities<br> will never forget.<br> What are you gawking at?<br> Looking at that bottle.<br> - Are you thirsty?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I want the bottle.<br> - What for?<br> I got a use for it.<br> What use?<br> I ain't gonna cut my throat,<br> if that's what's worryin' you.<br> - What about the refund?<br> - So I'll owe you a penny!<br> How about it?<br> Well, you're welcome.<br> Son of a...<br> - Well, now what do you want?<br> - That box you're sittin' on.<br> - That's tough.<br> - It's just an apple box.<br> - You could get another.<br> - I could.<br> - Well?<br> - But I ain't.<br> - Why not?<br> - I ain't so inclined.<br> All right, I'll buy it off you.<br> What do you want?<br> One pack of cigarettes? Two? Name it.<br> If you showed me a hundred-dollar bill,<br> you couldn't have this box.<br> What the hell is eatin' you?<br> to look at that frozen mug of yours.<br> And in all that time, never so much<br> as a how-de-do out of you.<br> I try to treat you decent,<br> cos you got no bed of roses.<br> So I put my head on the block<br> and I dummy up about the birds.<br> Did you say thanks, my boy?<br> Did just once you say thanks?<br> Or maybe I just didn't hear you.<br> You're a soft speaker.<br> You want a pop bottle.<br> You want a pop bottle.<br> Do I hear maybe<br> the word "please" someplace?<br> Or could I be goin' deaf?<br> "Hand over the box" says you,<br> like you was the tsar of Russia<br> or somebody.<br> You get this. I may be just a uniform<br> to you, but you got no patent on feelings.<br> I'm a man, the same as you,<br> and I wanna be treated like one.<br> So you'd better come up<br> with a few manners with me,<br> or don't even expect the time of day<br> from yours truly!<br> Mr Ransom.<br> - You know what I think, Bull?<br> - I don't give a damn what you think.<br> I think you're absolutely right.<br> I admire ya for sounding off like that.<br> I had it comin'.<br> You always treated me square.<br> You been good to me.<br> So there's something I wanna do.<br> I wanna apologise to you.<br> I ain't apologised to anybody in 20 years.<br> - Hey, Stroud.<br> - Yeah?<br> My bird won't sing.<br> Is he sick?<br> I'll check him.<br> You sick, little baby canary Jack?<br> Say "tweety-dee", sweetheart.<br> Tweet tweet tweet tweet.<br> I don't know.<br> You been giving him special feedings<br> of grasshoppers and bugs like I told you?<br> I can't find any!<br> By the time I get to the bullpen,<br> you cleaned it out!<br> What do you want me to do?<br> You got a way with birds.<br> You take Jack for a while, huh?<br> What about birdseed?<br> All right, I'll split mine with you.<br> - What do you say?<br> - All right. Send him in.<br> Only for about a year or so<br> and then I want him back.<br> OK.<br> You be careful, take it easy<br> and don't mash him.<br> You don't care of him, I'll bust you apart.<br> - Don't worry, Feto.<br> - Come on, Gomez.<br> It's your exercise period.<br> Well, how about it, Stroud? Is he sick?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Why don't he sing?<br> - It wouldn't be polite.<br> - Don't be smart!<br> Feto, don't you know<br> a lady canary never sings?<br> Lady canary?<br> - You mean Jack's a broad canary?<br> - Yep. A hen.<br> Well, tough luck, Bob.<br> You're stuck with a bird that don't sing.<br> Use up a lot of birdseed, huh?<br> Working with a razor blade<br> and ajagged piece of glass,<br> Stroud cut 128 slats,<br> in addition to roof boards,<br> tier bars, gate pieces and a handle.<br> Everyjoint was charred for hardness<br> and hand-fitted,<br> since he had no glue.<br> The birdcage took<br> seven months to complete.<br> Bob, that's a hell of a job you did there.<br> It's all right. Not bad.<br> - Next one'll be better.<br> - The next one?<br> What do you want another one for?<br> Ain't you got eyes? Mr and Mrs.<br> There's gonna be<br> some procreation around here.<br> - Procre... what?<br> - New life. Birth.<br> - In a prison?<br> - Yep.<br> Well, I guess they won't mind.<br> Canaries are always behind bars anyway.<br> It's springtime outside, slugger.<br> You best go find out who you are.<br> Come on.<br> Now what's wrong with you,<br> you old buzzard? Come on.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Out there you can kick up the dust.<br> You can dance to fiddle music.<br> Watch the alfalfa bloom.<br> If you like, you can... see gold teeth.<br> Taste sweet whisky and red-eyed gravy.<br> The air breathes easy, nights move faster,<br> and you tell time by the clock.<br> Now you don't wanna be a jailbird<br> all your life, do ya?<br> You're a highballin' sparrow.<br> So you fly high, old cock.<br> Go out there and bite the stars - for me.<br> Find yourself a fat mama<br> and make a family.<br> You hear?<br> Beat it.<br> Hey, Stroud.<br> Yeah, Feto?<br> - My bird laid an egg, huh?<br> - My bird laid an egg.<br> Why, you stinkin' crook!<br> I only loaned you my canary!<br> For a year.<br> I want half them eggs.<br> What for? You gonna make an omelette?<br> Any con who'd steal canary eggs<br> from another con is a dirty fink!<br> And a rat!<br> How many, Stroud?<br> Two?<br> How many, Stroud?<br> Three? Dirty crook.<br> How many?<br> Four.<br> How many?<br> Hey, Stroud. Anything happen yet?<br> Now it's been 20 days and 18 hours.<br> What's goin' on in there?<br> - Hey, Bob, what's that noise in there?<br> - Quiet, Feto.<br> Feto, you're a godfather.<br> Sealed off from the world,<br> denied the fundamental drive of man<br> to beget his own kind,<br> Stroud developed a world<br> in microcosm with his birds.<br> And because it was safe, and he knew<br> they would never turn on him,<br> he developed a deep but private<br> love for his canaries,<br> as he watched the cycle of love<br> and mating and issuing forth.<br> Then, one spring day,<br> an old friend came back.<br> Runty! What the hell<br> are you doin' back here?<br> Too tough out there, huh?<br> Come back for a little prison security.<br> I guess you're a lifer, pal, just like me.<br> Hey, Stroud. How come<br> the birds ain't singin'?<br> Because they're sick, and so's mine.<br> Hey, Stroud.<br> My bird's gonna kick off?<br> "Dreaded among breeders is a highly<br> contagious disease called septic fever."<br> "lts actual existence can only be surmised<br> by a postmortem by<br> a veterinary surgeon trained in..."<br> - Bob!<br> - Pipe down, Gomez.<br> "Death may be rapid or delayed."<br> "Faeces are abnormal<br> and always pale yellow in colour."<br> "There's no practical remedy."<br> Stroud?<br> I found Bacillus pasteurella<br> in great quantity.<br> I'd make an educated guess<br> that there's a filterable virus.<br> That it is septic fever?<br> Possibly.<br> Are there any chemicals<br> or medicines or anything?<br> I couldn't find any literature on<br> the disease. Apparently there isn't any.<br> So, without any specific drug, I'm afraid<br> there isn't much I can do to help.<br> Thanks, Doc. I appreciate what you done.<br> Sorry.<br> Any change?<br> Runty.<br> Shame.<br> He wasn't much of a bird. I threw him out,<br> but I guess it was too tough for him.<br> He had to come back<br> where he could freeload.<br> He was a born panhandler.<br> Tried to get rid of him<br> as late as last Friday.<br> I warned him, but he wouldn't<br> listen to me. He was too smart.<br> He'd rather have the walls<br> than somebody to talk to.<br> He didn't amount to much.<br> Hey, Bob.<br> You know Ape?<br> The baby bird you slipped me.<br> Well, in case you're interested,<br> he just knocked off.<br> Punk.<br> He dropped like he got shot in the head.<br> Reminded me of an old girlfriend<br> of mine named Peggy... Beeman.<br> What a face. Like a pan full of worms.<br> But stacked. Like to make<br> your tongue hang out.<br> Good-hearted broad, you know.<br> She used to put out to me.<br> And every other guy<br> in the neighbourhood.<br> A bum, in other words.<br> Well, she had a bird too. A parrot.<br> And he too was ugly also.<br> And one time I came up to her room,<br> and the door was open,<br> and she was tryin' to teach<br> the parrot to say somethin'.<br> You'll get a boot outta this, Bob.<br> You know what she wanted him to say?<br> "I love you, Peggy."<br> Over and over, you know,<br> she kept at him. "I love you, Peggy."<br> Oh, them two uglies.<br> I figured she was some kinda nut, so<br> I never seen her no more after that time.<br> Good old Peg.<br> So what happens?<br> So I wind up in the can,<br> and I'm talking to the birds<br> just like she did.<br> You know... I gotta admit it,<br> for the first time since I been in stir,<br> them baby canaries,<br> they make me feel good.<br> You know, it ain't just right<br> to flush Apey down the toilet bowl.<br> Hey, Stroud, what am I<br> supposed to do with him, huh?<br> What am I gonna do?<br> Hey, Bob?<br> Stroud struck back<br> at the oldest enemy of all.<br> Wash the cages, sterilise<br> the cell from top to bottom,<br> read everything in<br> the prison library about birds.<br> He learned of oxidisers, which had been<br> used as a poultry germicide for years.<br> He wrote to his mother, asking<br> for these drugs, plus equipment.<br> While waiting, he tried<br> fantastic concoctions on his birds,<br> like a sulphur solution<br> made from the heads of matches.<br> The birds died with increasing swiftness.<br> The package of drugs and<br> equipment came from Mother.<br> With little or no knowledge of the amount<br> of chemicals a canary could tolerate,<br> Stroud proceeded to administer<br> the oxidisers to his sick birds.<br> Clearly, this drug was<br> no cure for septic fever,<br> but Stroud persisted,<br> trying different combinations.<br> The birds still died.<br> However, Stroud made one discovery:<br> before death, their temperature<br> dropped to normal.<br> He concluded the chemicals<br> were too harsh, too caustic.<br> He decided to buffer them<br> with effervescent sodas.<br> The birds died.<br> Hey, Stroud! When you gonna<br> find a medicine for my birds?<br> They're droppin' like flies!<br> - We'll just have to wait.<br> - Wait?<br> I'm gonna kill 'em all!<br> Finally, there was only<br> one more buffering agent left<br> in his tiny arsenal of drugs:<br> Citrocarbonate.<br> He combined this<br> with potassium chlorate.<br> He dosed his birds. After that,<br> all he could do was hope.<br> - Three o'clock, Bob.<br> - Thanks, Johnson.<br> Hey, Bob?<br> What happened? Why is that bird singin'?<br> You find a medicine?<br> Go to it, kid. Sing your heart out.<br> The years passed,<br> and news of Stroud's medicine spread<br> to the gentle world of bird owners.<br> People began to wonder who<br> this strange new bird doctor was.<br> Finally, someone got curious.<br> Bob, did you enter some kind of a contest<br> in one of those canary magazines?<br> Yeah. I won second prize - a roller canary.<br> Well, you'd better go pick it up.<br> It's in the deputy's office.<br> Good.<br> - What's up?<br> - Not a thing.<br> You must be Mr Stroud.<br> Here you are. Your second prize.<br> A night roller of St Andreasburg stock.<br> I'm Mrs Stella Johnson. I offered the prize.<br> - Who let you in?<br> - The warden. It took three days.<br> Well, I suppose you wonder why I'm here.<br> Well, I kept reading your articles<br> and letters to the journal.<br> Then I tried your cure of oxidising agents<br> on one of my birds with septic fever,<br> and, by golly, it worked.<br> So I began to wonder<br> who this new bird doctor was.<br> And when you won the prize I put up,<br> my curiosity really got the best of me.<br> So I just had to find out who<br> Box 7, Leavenworth, Kansas was.<br> So I... I wrote to the postmaster<br> at Leavenworth and asked him,<br> and he told me it was<br> the federal penitentiary.<br> Why did you come to see me?<br> Well, you see,<br> I live in Shelbyville, Indiana.<br> And I was visiting a cousin in St Louis,<br> and Leavenworth isn't far...<br> You were visiting in St Louis<br> and you carried him all the way with you?<br> Well, the way it was...<br> I was going...<br> I thought...<br> Yes?<br> Mr Stroud, I'm terribly sorry<br> for taking so much of your time.<br> Good luck with the roller.<br> Mrs Johnson.<br> Thank you for bringing him.<br> Well, actually, you know, I...<br> I did have an idea when I came here.<br> Idea?<br> Have you ever thought<br> of selling your bird remedies?<br> Go ahead.<br> Well...<br> I have a little money. Not much. But<br> I believe it would be a good investment.<br> You make 'em and I sell 'em.<br> I've even thought of a name.<br> Stroud's Specifics.<br> Well, I'll be darned.<br> You said your name<br> was Mrs Stella Johnson.<br> - I'm a widow woman.<br> - I see.<br> My husband passed away<br> eight years ago.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Truth is, about all<br> I've got in life is my birds.<br> What do you know about me,<br> Mrs Johnson?<br> That you killed two men.<br> - Any questions?<br> - No.<br> Stroud's Specifics. Well.<br> - You hear a roll of the drums just then?<br> - Drums?<br> - There was even a trombone there.<br> - Meaning what?<br> The formation of our new company.<br> You mean you made up<br> your mind just like that?<br> One thing I've learned<br> is not to abuse time.<br> I suggest we split everything right down<br> the middle, if that's all right with you.<br> I never thought a business<br> could be set up this fast.<br> - You can change your mind if you want.<br> - Not me.<br> Yes, I guess so.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> I was just saying goodbye<br> to Shelbyville, Indiana.<br> I'll be moving to Leavenworth.<br> I've got to be near my factory.<br> This is a big day for me, Mrs Johnson.<br> I have a feeling you've brought me luck.<br> - I hope so.<br> - Time's up.<br> Before you go, would you do me a favour?<br> Of course. What is it?<br> Would it be too personal to...<br> to let me look through your purse?<br> Go ahead.<br> Lipstick?<br> - Cigarette case?<br> - Powder compact.<br> Oh, yes.<br> What were you looking for?<br> A hacksaw.<br> Write me when you get ready to move.<br> I'll have my mother find a place for you.<br> All right. Goodbye.<br> So long, partner.<br> Hey, Bob, get a load of this.<br> Hey, you hear that, Bob?<br> What's that word?<br> Congress.<br> The prison grapevine<br> hammered out the news<br> that a Federal Bureau of Prisons<br> had been created by an act of Congress.<br> Director: AJ MacLeod.<br> The new warden who came to<br> Leavenworth was Albert Comstock.<br> One of the first prisoners<br> he asked to see was Robert Stroud.<br> - Sit down, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> You've heard about the formation<br> of the new Bureau of Prisons, of course.<br> I have several directives from Washington<br> that will affect you personally.<br> I wanted to read them to you myself.<br> Go ahead, Warden.<br> The first one states<br> that no pets of any kind<br> will be allowed<br> in federal penitentiaries.<br> The second directive forbids any inmate<br> to engage in any commercial enterprise.<br> Do you know what that means?<br> That means my birds.<br> I'm sorry, Stroud.<br> I know how important they are to you.<br> Nobody looks at my record, huh?<br> - That don't mean billy-be-damned.<br> - You're exaggerating your importance.<br> These directives weren't made just<br> for you. It applies to the entire system.<br> Prisoners now have dogs, cats,<br> parrots, canary birds, even monkeys.<br> It's bad sanitation.<br> Feeding becomes a big problem.<br> It creates feuds among inmates.<br> Other prisoners complain of lice and fleas.<br> The situation simply has to be cleaned up.<br> You have 60 days to get rid of your aviary.<br> That's all, Stroud.<br> I never thought Uncle Sam<br> would go back on his word.<br> Meaning what?<br> There's been an understanding between<br> the government and me, for 11 years,<br> that I could raise my birds.<br> That pledge has been broken.<br> - As far as I'm concerned, all bets are off.<br> - That sounds like a threat.<br> Warden, you just got through<br> tellin' me that I ain't very important.<br> How could I threaten a big,<br> powerful Washington bureau?<br> I've been doin' a lot of thinkin', Mother.<br> I have a plan, and it might work.<br> What kind of a plan?<br> Do you remember how<br> you saved my neck in 1920?<br> - Yes, but I don't see...<br> - Publicity. That's what did it.<br> I don't think I follow you.<br> How many bird owners<br> know I'm a convict?<br> - Just a few.<br> - Then we'll tell 'em.<br> We'll tell 'em how<br> they're gonna take my birds away.<br> We'll write to newspapers,<br> radio stations, commentators, columnists,<br> bird clubs, magazines.<br> We'll have people angry<br> from coast to coast.<br> Excellent, Robbie. Excellent.<br> We'll drive 'em right down the pike.<br> It'll be just like it was in the old days.<br> Just the two of us together,<br> fighting the world.<br> I've just been to see Bob,<br> and I smuggled out this.<br> It's instructions for the campaign.<br> Why should he give you this material?<br> The kind of thing he usually<br> entrusts to his mother.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I guess that time was short.<br> It doesn't really matter, does it?<br> There's a great deal of copying<br> to be done. You'll follow my directions.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Start with letters to the bird clubs.<br> When you've finished I'll assign you more.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Here it is. Right here on the second page<br> of the Kansas City Star.<br> - Here.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> That's not enough.<br> I want the front page. We're ready now<br> for the next step of our campaign.<br> - You got another idea?<br> - Yes, and it's dynamite.<br> I came across it in an old law book.<br> Stell, you can save my neck.<br> How? Bob, you know I'd do anything.<br> Now, listen, how would you<br> like to marry me?<br> Let me understand you, now. Are you<br> trying to tell me that you married a man<br> serving a life term in solitary<br> at Leavenworth penitentiary?<br> Yes, sir. Yesterday.<br> And where did the ceremony take place?<br> At the penitentiary.<br> By the prison chaplain, no doubt?<br> No, sir. It was a civil ceremony.<br> Well, go ahead. I've listened this far.<br> Well, you see...<br> Yes?<br> You see, under the laws of the Treaty<br> of Paris and the Louisiana Purchase,<br> all a man and woman had to do to be<br> legally married was to sign a declaration.<br> You see, Leavenworth<br> is still federal property<br> and is therefore immune to<br> the laws of the state of Kansas.<br> It's all here, sir, if you want to read it.<br> Stroud got his front page - and with<br> a bang heard all the way to Washington.<br> Result: one of the strangest<br> conferences in prison history.<br> The warden's on his way right now.<br> - Hello, Bob.<br> - Hello, Harvey.<br> Well, you've succeeded in creating<br> quite a little flurry with your birds.<br> Just an inmate protecting his rights.<br> Would you like to sit down?<br> Yes, thanks.<br> Bob... I've been sent here as a delegate<br> of the bureau to make you an offer.<br> That's what I've been waiting for.<br> Now the bureau is willing to let you<br> keep your birds. You can even sell 'em.<br> Now this is their official proposal.<br> You can continue<br> to raise and sell the birds,<br> but the profits will be turned over<br> to the prison welfare fund,<br> and you will receive a salary<br> in the form of a share of the profits.<br> I consider that quite a generous offer<br> under the circumstances.<br> Frankly, it's more than I would<br> have offered, had I the authority.<br> Well, Stroud?<br> Let me see if I understand you.<br> You're proposing that the US government<br> go into the canary-bird business.<br> That's against private enterprise.<br> You sound like a Bolshevik, Harvey.<br> - You have no legal right to raise canaries.<br> - I know.<br> Rule 60 of the Federal Bureau of Prisons<br> Manual: "An inmate cannot be permitted<br> to operate a business, no matter<br> how legitimate, while in prison."<br> - That right?<br> - You quoted it correctly.<br> That's what I thought.<br> That's why I'm confused.<br> The rule says I can't have a business.<br> You say I can, provided<br> I give you the profits.<br> That's circumventing regulations.<br> It's not like you.<br> Mr Shoemaker came to try to work out<br> a plan so you can keep your blasted birds.<br> Don't con an old con, Warden.<br> He came because of public opinion,<br> and you know it.<br> Congressmen jumping<br> all over MacLeod's back.<br> I think I got you over a barrel, Harvey.<br> Is that your last word?<br> I could use more room.<br> For my birds.<br> I'll report the minutes<br> of our conference to Mr MacLeod.<br> That's all, Comstock.<br> Have a nice trip back to Washington.<br> I'm not going back to Washington.<br> I'm heading a new penitentiary. Alcatraz.<br> That's a big job, Harvey.<br> I wish you luck.<br> Thank you.<br> Keep one thing in mind, Bob.<br> The public has a short memory.<br> Hello, Mother. Here, sit ye down.<br> You hear that? You know what that is?<br> It's a jackhammer.<br> And do you know what it's doin'?<br> - No, I haven't been informed as yet.<br> - They're tearing down the wall of my cell.<br> And cuttin' through<br> a doorway into the next one.<br> - I'm gonna have two cells for my birds.<br> - How nice.<br> I can keep 'em and I can sell 'em.<br> I get larger quarters and even some<br> laboratory equipment. How about that?<br> Two women and a con,<br> and we whipped the bureau to a standstill.<br> That's very good news indeed.<br> Of course, there was a time<br> when I would have been the first to know.<br> It's a real victory, Mother.<br> And I got you and Stell to thank.<br> Sit down, Robbie.<br> - I want to talk to you about her.<br> - About Stella?<br> Your association with her<br> will bring you nothing but trouble.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> She's the wrong kind of a woman<br> for you to align yourself with.<br> She's worked her heart out for me.<br> She saved my bacon.<br> All right. She was of use temporarily,<br> but she's served her purpose.<br> And now if you'll follow my advice,<br> you'll get rid of her.<br> I don't understand<br> what you're talkin' about, Mom.<br> She's my wife.<br> Your trouble began with<br> that other woman in Alaska.<br> She's the same kind of a woman.<br> - She's a common adventuress.<br> - Don't say things like that, Mother.<br> She's a good woman. And she's kind.<br> And she'd do anything in the world for me.<br> It's disaster, Robbie.<br> She'll bring you nothing but heartache.<br> Besides, all she wanted was the publicity.<br> Mother... you can't be serious.<br> I can't believe this is happening.<br> Give her up, Robbie. Forget her.<br> You act as though<br> you wanted me here for all time.<br> With you as my only outside connection.<br> Then...<br> Then you choose her<br> instead of your own mother?<br> Don't say any more, Mother.<br> Please.<br> That's your decision? To desert me?<br> Mrs Stroud? My name is Peterson.<br> I'm a reporter from the Kansas City Star.<br> My paper wants a follow-up story<br> on your son's marriage.<br> No comment.<br> Well, does this so-called marriage<br> come as a surprise to you, Mrs Stroud?<br> I knew nothing of it.<br> Your son's parole hearing is coming up.<br> Who'll lead the fight this time?<br> You or Stella Johnson?<br> There will be no fight.<br> Wait a minute, Mrs Stroud.<br> What do you mean, there'll be no fight?<br> Just what does that mean?<br> My son is where he belongs.<br> I shall do nothing to obtain<br> his release from the penitentiary.<br> And this is for quotation?<br> I know he's safe where he is.<br> I wanna be sure. Are you saying<br> you'd rather have him in there than free?<br> You now oppose your own son's parole?<br> I'm doing it for his own good.<br> Well, Bob, you're the first con<br> in history that ever had two cells.<br> Gonna be great for the birds.<br> It's in all the papers. I can't understand<br> how she could turn on you that way.<br> Do you know what a mother tiger<br> does when she's upset?<br> She eats her young.<br> Maybe I could talk to your old lady,<br> try and fix it up.<br> I guarantee she'll change her mind.<br> Bob!<br> Far as I'm concerned, she's dead.<br> I gotta go make my bed check.<br> You know what this is, friends?<br> This is 180-proof alcohol.<br> I'm gonna make me<br> a Leavenworth cocktail.<br> You watch now.<br> You're gonna see me get drunk.<br> Fly, my avian friends.<br> I give you the illusion of freedom.<br> Enjoy it.<br> Go ahead, open it.<br> Go ahead.<br> Picked it up last night in a hockshop.<br> Thought you might get a kick out of it.<br> Why don't you look at somethin',<br> see if it works?<br> Mr Ransom, you sure are a darlin' man!<br> keep both eyes open.<br> After a while, you'll see only<br> through the eye of the eyepiece.<br> That's the ticket.<br> For Stroud, that microscope<br> was the lantern he had been waiting for<br> to light his way into the marvellous<br> and exacting truth of scientific research.<br> His object: the bird.<br> His tools: curiosity, dedication,<br> and the nerve of a riverboat gambler,<br> as he ripped into studies which read like<br> the curriculum of a medical university.<br> Cytology, morphology, biochemistry.<br> Stroud decided he was<br> equipped to launch a project<br> he had long dreamed about -<br> a definitive work on the diseases of birds.<br> He had found cures for diseases<br> he could hardly pronounce,<br> like haemorrhagic septicaemia, bird<br> diphtheria, aspergillosis, avian cholera.<br> He even found a specific<br> for fowl paralysis,<br> thereby saving poultry ranches<br> the lives of thousands of chickens.<br> The title of his book was "Stroud's<br> Digest of the Diseases of Birds".<br> Its contents established beyond doubt<br> that the ageing prisoner was<br> the world's foremost authority in his field.<br> The book took seven years to complete.<br> I want your scientific opinion<br> about this book of Stroud's.<br> Is it baloney or does it<br> amount to anything?<br> Well, Doctor?<br> It's hardly what you'd call baloney.<br> It's a highly scientific study<br> of the pathology - diseases - of birds.<br> You think Stroud's<br> quite a man, don't you?<br> I think he's a genius.<br> Why? Just because<br> he's written a book about birds?<br> No. No, not because of that.<br> Because, with only<br> a third-grade education,<br> he's become expert<br> in subjects like haematology -<br> that's blood.<br> Histology - tissue. Anatomy.<br> Studies tough enough with an instructor<br> in college, but self-taught in a cell,<br> an accomplishment<br> that staggers imagination.<br> He's smart. He has a high IQ.<br> He's more than that. He's dedicated.<br> He's spent over 3,000 hours<br> at that microscope of his,<br> made hundreds of drawings,<br> over 5,000 tissue sections.<br> He has one of the finest collections<br> of slides on birds in existence.<br> knows more about avian anatomy<br> and pathology than any man alive.<br> OK. I'll recommend his book<br> go to the publisher's.<br> Make the bird-lovers happy.<br> If Stroud's paroled and gets a laboratory,<br> there's no telling what he might do.<br> He should be working on<br> human diseases, not birds'.<br> Paroled? Not much chance of that.<br> I thought his record was good.<br> Not in the eyes of the bureau.<br> His attitude is poor.<br> He thinks he's a world unto himself,<br> like we were his own<br> personal quartermaster corps.<br> Chemicals,<br> laboratory equipment, birdseed.<br> Now he's demanding 25lbs of ice<br> every day. It's got to stop someplace.<br> I'd give him 500lbs of ice<br> a day if he wanted it.<br> You would, huh?<br> I wonder if the bureau<br> isn't afraid of Stroud.<br> Afraid to let the public know what kind of<br> a brain they're keeping locked up here.<br> Doctor, we're keeping<br> a killer locked up here.<br> Don't forget it.<br> I heard from that professor,<br> the one at the university of Kansas.<br> He said if I were out, I might have<br> a good chance to get a research grant.<br> - What's that?<br> - Well, they pay you to do research.<br> Bob! But that's wonderful!<br> Only one drawback - gettin' out.<br> Well, how can the parole board<br> turn you down now?<br> Boy, they talk about rehabilitation.<br> This book and the cures you discovered...<br> What do they want?<br> I wish you were on that board, Stell.<br> I'd be strollin' down the avenue right now.<br> But let's not make any plans.<br> I've seen too many of 'em go up in smoke.<br> You still won't let yourself<br> think about getting out, will you?<br> Bob, what's wrong with<br> having a little faith?<br> You're always bringing me new words.<br> Like "love" and "faith".<br> You're a wonderful man.<br> You've done some great things.<br> I have faith that the parole board<br> will see how good you are.<br> Golly, you just can't go on thinking that<br> you're gonna be here the rest of your life.<br> All right, honey. I'll bring faith<br> into my cell tonight and entertain it.<br> Just for the soup course.<br> But don't you start buying me<br> any new neckties yet, OK?<br> You look pretty today.<br> Bob, come on, wake up.<br> Bob, wake up. Come on. Get up.<br> What's up, Bull?<br> Your transfer orders.<br> Alcatraz.<br> Here. Better get dressed.<br> - Dressed?<br> - Now. They're on their way down.<br> All right, let's go.<br> - Why this time of night?<br> - Orders. Step on it.<br> What about my equipment? My birds?<br> Our instructions are you walk outta here<br> with just the clothes you have on.<br> I got a sick bird in there. Can I fix it?<br> Of course you can.<br> Listen to me, Bull.<br> I want you to talk to Stella.<br> I want you to tell her not to follow me.<br> Under no conditions.<br> Understand?<br> You better grab that pension and beat it,<br> before these walls get to ya.<br> I'll try and write.<br> Don't waste your time grieving over me.<br> When it's cut, it's cut.<br> So long, friend.<br> Merry Christmas, boys.<br> I could use a rest.<br> Yes?<br> Prisoner Stroud<br> completed processing, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Dog block. Solitary again, hm?<br> It's not called solitary here. Segregation.<br> Interesting name.<br> - Silence rule?<br> - Strictly enforced.<br> Hello, Bob.<br> - How are you, Harvey?<br> - Pretty good for an old man.<br> You're looking well.<br> How was your trip out?<br> Not too unpleasant, I hope.<br> Well, I've always enjoyed travelling.<br> It's quite an establishment<br> you've got here.<br> Yes, it has its good points.<br> It's modern, well-heated, clean.<br> First thing I noticed. Almost antiseptic.<br> Yeah, you'll find no cockroaches here.<br> We have linoleum on<br> all the floors of the cells.<br> Coming over on the launch,<br> I saw some children playing.<br> They belong to the guards<br> and all the other personnel.<br> We all live on the Rock, too.<br> Interesting, isn't it?<br> The game of tag never grows old.<br> Doesn't seem so long ago<br> I played it myself.<br> I got a good report on you<br> from Leavenworth, Bob.<br> And I'm satisfied you'll make<br> the adjustment here.<br> Now, your orders call for segregation.<br> But I think if you toe the mark,<br> eventually we can improve on that,<br> make things a little more pleasant for you.<br> My office is always open. If you're not<br> treated right, just let me know.<br> Do the children enjoy living here?<br> I don't suppose any of us<br> truly enjoy living on this island.<br> It wasn't designed for pleasure.<br> Stroud.<br> Hey, Stroud.<br> Feto.<br> Feto Gomez.<br> You old buzzard. I heard you was comin'.<br> - It's good to see ya. How do you feel?<br> - Still squeakin' by.<br> Remember the birds? Huh?<br> Ape and Jackie.<br> Them was good times, you know.<br> They sure were. Gee, you look good.<br> I still figure you stole<br> them baby canaries from me.<br> Well, you know me, Feto.<br> I'm just an old thief.<br> Have you seen the Shoemaker lately?<br> He met me at the barn door.<br> Well, he ain't such a bad old guy.<br> We been cutting it pretty good lately.<br> He made me trusty.<br> - Trusty?<br> - Sure.<br> No use beatin' your head up against the<br> wall. I should've wised up a long time ago.<br> I been flyin' right lately,<br> because my parole<br> comes up again in November,<br> and I'm gonna hit those bricks<br> before I kick the bucket, you see?<br> Sure. Sure, I understand, Feto.<br> You still go for the mince pie?<br> I can do you a lot of good, because I'm<br> the head man with the steam table here.<br> And old Feto Gomez can sneak you two,<br> maybe even three pieces every so often.<br> - Feto.<br> - Yeah?<br> - How much time you done?<br> - Time?<br> Yeah. How much time? Altogether?<br> I don't know.<br> Let me recollect.<br> I knocked off four at Atlanta.<br> I did three at Juliet.<br> And then I did that ten-spot<br> with you at Leavenworth.<br> And then I was on the street for four.<br> And then I been here for six.<br> - How much is that?<br> - 23.<br> Yeah.<br> - Why do you wanna know, Bob?<br> - Nothin'. I just wondered.<br> - What's all the gabbin', Gomez?<br> - Nothin', sir.<br> The prisoner just wanted<br> some more meat.<br> No chance, Stroud. No extra portions.<br> Everybody gets treated the same here,<br> you understand?<br> - Bob.<br> - I'm gonna wallop you today.<br> Congratulations on<br> the publication of your book.<br> Yeah, it's a honey. It should sell big.<br> But that's all behind me now.<br> I've started writin' a new book.<br> The history of federal prisons from 1790<br> up to the formation of the bureau.<br> A story about caged men<br> rather than birds.<br> What prison does to 'em.<br> Got the idea from seein' an old friend.<br> - It's an ambitious undertaking, Bob.<br> - It'll knock the public cold.<br> Graft, corruption,<br> stupidity, sadism.<br> All the elements<br> of a best seller, eh, Father?<br> - It's a story that needs telling.<br> - And how!<br> You realise, of course,<br> it involves a certain element of risk.<br> I do indeed.<br> But you know somethin'?<br> When you've lived in these manure piles<br> for over 30 years, as I have,<br> you come to know everything's a risk.<br> Your serve.<br> - I wish you luck.<br> - It's worth the gamble.<br> I'm confiscating this manuscript, Bob.<br> Have you read it?<br> Enough to realise that it's a blast<br> at the entire penal system.<br> You're in serious trouble.<br> The bureau has known for months<br> what you were writing.<br> You haven't told me what you think of it.<br> I resent this personally.<br> I stand high in my profession,<br> and I believe I've earned that esteem.<br> I am proud of the advances<br> that I have helped to inaugurate.<br> Think back to the old times.<br> Leg irons, carrying the iron ball,<br> stripes, corporal punishment,<br> indefinite periods in the hole.<br> I have been instrumental<br> in abolishing that kind of treatment.<br> Yes, that's true, Harvey.<br> Furthermore, you completely ignore my<br> fight for a constructive work programme.<br> Like making belt buckles,<br> or running a drill press?<br> I see.<br> My entire career has been for nothing.<br> I'm all wrong and you're all right.<br> I'm not talking about one tree, Harvey.<br> I'm talking about the whole forest.<br> I haven't spent most of my life<br> behind bars for nothing.<br> I've reached conclusions about penology,<br> and a couple of them may be valid.<br> When you first came here,<br> I thought you were changed.<br> I was even planning to return you<br> to the general prison population.<br> And now this. Well,<br> you're not gonna get away with it.<br> The bureau has suggested privileges be<br> suspended. You know what that means.<br> You know better than try to frighten me,<br> Harvey, at this late date.<br> Damn your heart!<br> Do you think that<br> I wanna go on punishing you?<br> We've grown old together, and in all that<br> time I've only asked one thing from you.<br> Cooperation. The only thing<br> I've ever gotten back was defiance!<br> Not once have you ever shown<br> a sign of rehabilitation!<br> - Rehabilitation.<br> - Yes. Rehabilitation.<br> I wonder if you know<br> what the word means.<br> Do you?<br> Now don't be insulting.<br> The unabridged Webster's<br> International Dictionary<br> says it comes from the Latin root habilis.<br> The definition is:<br> to invest again with dignity.<br> Do you consider that part of your job, to<br> give a man back the dignity he once had?<br> Your only interest is in how he behaves.<br> You told me that once a long time ago,<br> and I'll never forget it.<br> "You'll conform to our ideas<br> of how you should behave."<br> And you haven't retreated from<br> that stand one inch in 35 years.<br> You want your prisoners to dance<br> out the gates like puppets on a string,<br> with rubber-stamp values<br> impressed by you,<br> with your sense of conformity,<br> your sense of behaviour,<br> even your sense of morality.<br> That's why you're a failure, Harvey.<br> You and the whole science of penology.<br> Because you rob prisoners of<br> the most important thing in their lives -<br> their individuality.<br> On the outside they're lost, automatons,<br> just going through the motions of living.<br> But underneath there's a deep,<br> deep hatred for what you did to them.<br> First chance they get<br> to attack society, they do it.<br> The result? More than half<br> come back to prison.<br> Now it's all here in my book.<br> And I suggest you read it<br> and you read it thoroughly.<br> All right, you've spoken your piece.<br> I have no course left but to speak mine.<br> This San Francisco climate sure doesn't<br> help an old man's aches and pains.<br> Where does it hurt you, Harvey?<br> In my left shoulder and down my arm.<br> You should have a medical checkup.<br> Yeah.<br> You got a visitor.<br> Hello, Bob.<br> Hello, Stell.<br> Well, here I am.<br> I know what you told Bull to tell me.<br> Then why did you come?<br> What else have I got to do?<br> Bob...<br> Bob, I could get on your visiting list.<br> I could get a job in Oakland maybe.<br> I could get a room at the waterfront,<br> and you could get some spyglasses<br> and see my room from your cell.<br> It's no use, Stell.<br> Please, Bob. There's still hope.<br> Bureau policy changes.<br> There's always the chance<br> the president will pardon you.<br> Why did you come<br> Just to see me once a month?<br> I came because I'm your wife, that's why.<br> Bob, the only life I got is you.<br> Then you've got a damned<br> poor future, old girl.<br> I'm never gonna get outta here.<br> I could get a job in a factory.<br> I could write letters every day.<br> - It would be like old times.<br> - You'd wither away and die waiting.<br> - Forget it, Stell. It's the end of the line.<br> - Please, Bob.<br> Now, listen to me. Listen carefully.<br> You fought your heart out for me.<br> You fought your heart out for me,<br> but the sun's gone down.<br> And don't look for it to rise again.<br> I want you to pretend that I'm a dead man.<br> I want you to pretend...<br> that you're standin' on my grave.<br> Remember the story<br> I told you about Runty,<br> my sparrow, how I turned him loose?<br> Yes, but he came back.<br> Yes, he came back and he died.<br> Stell, you're not such an old girl.<br> You still got a dance or two left in ya.<br> Don't waste 'em waitin' for a lifer.<br> All right, Bob.<br> Whatever you say.<br> Now you... go on back<br> to Shelbyville, Indiana.<br> Open up a pet store.<br> All right, Bob.<br> Specialise in parakeets.<br> They're the coming thing, you know.<br> I could still sell Stroud's Specifics.<br> - There's still a market for 'em.<br> - And canaries.<br> - People always like canaries.<br> - That's the ticket.<br> And if a bird got sick,<br> I could look in your book.<br> Sure, Stell.<br> I can have a nice little business.<br> Stell, you'll be just fine.<br> I've got to go now.<br> Goodbye, Bob.<br> Goodbye, wife.<br> A prison is<br> a vast boiler of despair,<br> stoked by hatred and anger.<br> Alcatraz has the reputation of being<br> the harshest of all American prisons.<br> This means endless hours of idleness,<br> with little useful work and<br> limited prospects for rehabilitation.<br> Eventually, the pressure of life<br> without hope becomes unendurable.<br> On a lovely spring day in May 1946,<br> two convicts named Logue and Burns<br> started one of the most terrifying<br> riots in prison history.<br> With a contrivance made<br> in the machine shop and smuggled out,<br> Burns spread the bars in the gun gallery,<br> secured arms and ammunition,<br> and crossed over to "D" block,<br> which contained Robert Stroud's cell.<br> You.<br> Hapling.<br> Come here.<br> Come here, you fink.<br> Open it.<br> We're takin' over!<br> Call the coastguard and tell him to start<br> circling the island with patrol boats.<br> I wanna talk to the commanding officer<br> on Treasure Island, the chief of police,<br> and the FBI.<br> I'll have a statement<br> for the press by midnight.<br> Yes.<br> The frenzied plan of escape<br> was hopeless from the beginning.<br> It was predicated on getting<br> the key to the exercise yard,<br> which would at least allow<br> the prisoners to get out in the open.<br> When this failed,<br> they knew they were doomed.<br> After a briefoutburst of destruction,<br> the prisoners settled<br> into a mood of quiet despair.<br> Shoemaker had no way of knowing that<br> the weapons possessed by the mutineers<br> totalled one rifle and one revolver,<br> with 71 rounds of ammunition.<br> He's hurt bad. He's hurt bad.<br> Go back! Go back!<br> The kid needs help.<br> You know somethin' about medicine.<br> Help?<br> Try and snap out of it.<br> Snap out of it, you punchy old bum!<br> Now hold on.<br> - Where's he hit?<br> - In the gut.<br> Let's go.<br> Turn on the PA system.<br> All for nothin'.<br> - How do you feel, kid?<br> - How do you think I feel? I'm dyin'.<br> Good femoral pulse.<br> There's not much bleeding.<br> I don't believe it hit a big artery.<br> It may have pierced the gut.<br> Colour's not bad.<br> Now listen to this. Men in "D" block,<br> this is Warden Shoemaker.<br> You haven't got a chance, you hear me?<br> You had better surrender your arms.<br> This'll all be over soon.<br> They'll get you to a hospital.<br> You got a good chance.<br> I'm doin' 25. I'll get grey-headed.<br> - What do I have to live for?<br> - You just lie quiet.<br> I'm fed up with this life.<br> You don't know what I'm goin' through,<br> old man. I'm sick of it.<br> I hope to God I do die.<br> Never had a real good day all my life.<br> Life.<br> Who needs it?<br> You're just a kid.<br> You got your whole future ahead of you.<br> Knock it off, will ya?<br> How dare you lie there<br> and talk about dyin' at your age.<br> Bull.<br> The kid wasn't hurt that bad.<br> How the hell do you know?<br> I tell you, he might have lived<br> if he'd put up a fight.<br> What's wrong with knocking yourself off<br> in a maggot pile like this?<br> - What?<br> - I said what's wrong with dyin'?<br> What's wrong with dying?<br> Cos life's too precious a gift, that's why.<br> Because the first duty of life is to live.<br> Prisoners of "D" block,<br> this is your last chance.<br> Show a white sheet at the window,<br> or we'll commence firing again.<br> Warden Shoemaker.<br> Warden Shoemaker.<br> Are you there?<br> Give me the bullhorn.<br> Can you hear me, Warden?<br> Harvey, this is Bob Stroud.<br> I can hear you, Stroud.<br> Then watch this.<br> There are now no more guns in "D" block.<br> You can call off your marines, Harvey.<br> This is isn't lwo Jima.<br> What about Logue and Burns?<br> They're dead.<br> Of course, if you wanna kill us all,<br> you can drop a small atom bomb.<br> How do I know there are<br> no more guns up there?<br> Because I give you my word.<br> I think it'll be safe to enter "D" block now.<br> There'll be no more firing.<br> Sir, you gonna take<br> the word of one convict?<br> That one convict's been<br> a thorn in my side for 35 years.<br> But I'll give him one thing.<br> He's never lied to me.<br> Warden Shoemaker died in 1953.<br> My book was published two years later.<br> It is not known ifits publication<br> and the ensuing protests<br> influenced the decision of authorities,<br> but in 1959 the old man was finally<br> allowed to leave the Rock.<br> It was not a release, however,<br> but a transfer to another prison.<br> Mr Stroud, how does it feel<br> to get off the Rock?<br> Well, If you San Franciscans<br> had any true civic pride,<br> you'd blow that place outta the water<br> instead of advertising it. What an eyesore.<br> Is it true you've never seen<br> a television set?<br> Yes, but from what I hear,<br> I haven't missed very much.<br> If you're paroled, do you think<br> you can adjust to the modern world?<br> Why? What's so special<br> about your modern world, son?<br> Boeing 707. Weighs 247,000lb.<br> Carries a payload of 22,000.<br> Each engine has a thrust of 13,000lb.<br> Cruises at 595 miles an hour.<br> Just because a man's in prison<br> doesn't mean he's a boob.<br> Will you work with birds<br> where you're going?<br> I'm afraid not.<br> In the eyes of the prison bureau,<br> avian research is, as you boys<br> might put it, for the birds.<br> All right.<br> Just one more question. Do you have<br> any particular project in mind?<br> Nothing specific.<br> I pass the time profitably.<br> I read a great deal, reflect.<br> I might even spend a pleasant hour<br> measuring the size of a cloud.<br> - Thanks, Mr Stroud.<br> - Good luck to you.<br> Can I have a minute, Mike?<br> You must be Tom Gaddis.<br> That's right, Mr Stroud.<br> I heard you were getting a transfer.<br> I thought I might get a chance to see you.<br> You know me well enough to call me Bob.<br> - How did you know it was me?<br> - An old con's instinct.<br> Bob, I was hoping when we met<br> it might be under different circumstances.<br> What circumstances?<br> A release, not a transfer. I'm sorry.<br> Don't be a square, Tom. I'm going<br> to Springfield, and do you know what?<br> I'm going to sleep in a room<br> without a lock on the door. Think of it.<br> To be able to walk in and out<br> of a room any time you want.<br> They got 400 acres up there.<br> I can walk a half a mile, maybe,<br> without once turning a corner. Imagine.<br> Don't be sorry, Tom. It's gonna be<br> a swell place to live till I get my release.<br> I know. Live it one day at a time.<br> You said it, kid. Soar like a bird.<br> We gotta catch a train, Bob.<br> All right, Mike.<br> Goodbye, Tom.<br> Thanks for helping me.<br> Tom, you know what they used to call<br> Alcatraz in the old days?<br> - What?<br> - Bird Island.<br> Robert Stroud's petition for parole<br> has been denied annually for 24 years.<br> Age 72, he is now in<br> his 53rd year of imprisonment.<br>
