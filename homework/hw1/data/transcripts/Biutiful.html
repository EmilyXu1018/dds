                        Is it real?<br> Yes.<br> At least that's what my father<br> told my mother.<br> Why do you have it?<br> Your grandfather gave it to your grandmother<br> before he left Spain.<br> She was pregnant and expecting me--<br> and she never saw him again.<br> It's beautiful.<br> I never imagined<br> I would touch a real diamond.<br> Can I try it on?<br> - Yes.<br> It's yours now, sweetie.<br> - Really?<br> I don't know. Mom always<br> wore it on this finger.<br> She said it wasn't real.<br> Your mother never heard the sound.<br> What sound?<br> The sound of the ocean.<br> When I was little--<br> one radio station<br> played the sounds of the sea.<br> Giant waves.<br> The sounds scared me.<br> Why were you scared?<br> The bottom of the sea scared me.<br> All the creatures that<br> live there.<br> Dad?<br> Dad...<br> Did you know that when an owl dies...<br> it spits out a fur ball?<br> You shouldn't go with the ponytail.<br> It makes you look like a fox.<br> It scares away the owls.<br> I saw that movie.<br> Don't you believe me?<br> Once there was nothing here.<br> Just water. Saltwater.<br> Do you know what it sounded like?<br> And the wind?<br> And the two together?<br> What's over there?<br> When did the symptoms start?<br> I don't know.<br> A couple of months ago.<br> You can get dressed.<br> Couldn't you have come sooner?<br> It did not hurt as much before.<br> The nurse will be by<br> to take some blood samples.<br> Good morning.<br> Aren't you going take it?<br> Open and close your fist.<br> Is that a new syringe?<br> - Yes.<br> Is it new?<br> - Yes, don't worry. It's new.<br> Damn!<br> - Sorry.<br> Have you done this before?<br> - Your veins are just hard to find.<br> Be careful.<br> - Sorry.<br> Open and close your fist.<br> Ouch! Damn!<br> Give me the syringe.<br> - Sorry, but...<br> Please<br> give me a syringe.<br> Where did you learn that?<br> Did you fast for eight hours?<br> -What do you mean by fast?<br> Didn't they say that?<br> -No. They're fucking lying...<br> Don't stab me again.<br> Let's go outside now.<br> Thank you.<br> Your eyelids are still<br> your heart as well.<br> Your eyelids are still<br> your heart just...<br> Why don't you leave?<br> What's keeping you here?<br> Did they tell you about the accident?<br> - Did you hear anything?<br> I only heard Luis.<br> The boy furthest away...<br> - Luis?<br> Luis is doing well.<br> I helped him on his way.<br> He told me that he repented<br> and asked for forgiveness...<br> for stealing a watch.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You are a disgrace. You fool.<br> You come here to talk nonsense.<br> My son was not a thief.<br> Now, let me explain. I came here because ...<br> Go away! Luis, tell him to go.<br> Show a little respect for our son.<br> Hai was asking for you.<br> Tell him I'll drop by tomorrow.<br> Hello.<br> Dad, I tried to call you.<br> - Sorry, I'm a bit late. Let's go.<br> Take your bag. Ready?<br> Thanks, Lili.<br> Tomorrow at five o'clock?<br> Say goodbye to Lili.<br> And Li.<br> -Bye.<br> Fish is gross.<br> We always eat the same thing.<br> What would you prefer?<br> A burger with fries...<br> and a chocolate milkshake.<br> With pleasure.<br> And the lady?<br> Fried eggs with sausages--<br> and a potato frittata<br> with cream and cinnamon.<br> Burger.<br> And look at all the fries.<br> French fries here,<br> there, and everywhere.<br> And a large chocolate milkshake.<br> What would you like, madam?<br> Fried egg.<br> - Fried egg...<br> With sausages.<br> - Sausages...<br> And a potato frittata.<br> Frittata...<br> - With cream and cinnamon.<br> As ordered.<br> What did you have for lunch today?<br> - Rice and chicken.<br> Dad, did you know...<br> that if an space suit<br> gets a hole, it explodes?<br> Tomorrow, I'll ask Lili<br> to make something else for you.<br> It isn't Lili who cooks.<br> - So I'll tell Jung.<br> It's because of gravity.<br> Stop kicking the table, Mateo.<br> And don't cram all that food<br> in your mouth.<br> I've told you a thousand times.<br> A thousand times.<br> Don't make a mess.<br> Put it in your mouth again.<br> Food in the mouth, Mateo.<br> Come on.<br> Food in the mouth, right now!<br> More milk?<br> - No.<br> Stop it!<br> Leave the table<br> and go into your room.<br> I told you to go to your room,<br> not to rinse off your plate.<br> What's wrong?<br> I peed my pants.<br> I'll wash them tomorrow, Dad.<br> Yes?<br> Just a moment.<br> Can you turn it down a bit?<br> Turn down the music and stop singing.<br> Yes, I'm here.<br> Sorry about that.<br> Yes, the cemetery called again.<br> No, they're going to build a mall.<br> Right on top of Dad.<br> They have offered me money.<br> Good money.<br> They handle the coffin and everything.<br> It's a good deal.<br> There's no way to prevent it, anyway.<br> We should definitely have Dad cremated.<br> Okay, let's do it.<br> Yeah, okay. I'll call you.<br> Okay, next week.<br> Take care.<br> See you.<br> Who's being cremated?<br> - No one.<br> Don't lie.<br> I'll give you a Thai massage.<br> Who?<br> If you don't tell me...<br> - My father!<br> He's going to be cremated.<br> Which of you takes after him the most?<br> - I don't know.<br> I don't remember what he looked like.<br> Give me a kiss.<br> I want to go.<br> I'm gonna go now.<br> Stop, I'm leaving.<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> Asshole.<br> Crazy.<br> Where are the others?<br> I met Chinaza on the way here.<br> Where?<br> - In El Fondo.<br> I sent the idiot away.<br> Where are Cheikh and Mamadou?<br> Keep them under control, or we're screwed!<br> I told you, they can't sell here.<br> It's off limits.<br> Understood?<br> Do you understand what I'm saying?<br> Elsewhere, no one buys.<br> I also hear<br> you've started selling drugs.<br> Pack up, guys. They're coming.<br> Watch out for cops.<br> Run!<br> I have something to show you.<br> At home with me.<br> in your home? Jeez...<br> It's stuck.<br> Won't open.<br> Thank you, Ige.<br> It's no use lowering the price<br> if nobody wants them.<br> Are they all like that?<br> Most of them.<br> It's been a lousy month.<br> You have to talk to the Chinese.<br> Maybe I can get umbrellas.<br> Screw that!<br> It never rains here.<br> Yes, it rains.<br> Can you sleep, with the baby?<br> - No none can.<br> Keep it down, will you. I have a guest.<br> Who made this?<br> Was it you?<br> Who made this shit? Would you<br> even use such a shit bag?<br> We make no money faking these goods.<br> It's now or never.<br> at 1300 euros each...<br> That's a lot of money.<br> I have to think about it first.<br> - Why? We think too much.<br> We'll lose the contract with Mendoza.<br> What about the workers? Should they<br> keep on making this shit?<br> I don't know what you are saying,<br> but you have to do something quickly.<br> I can't continue selling crap.<br> The idiot must be good for something.<br> - That idiot has done far more than you.<br> For your friend in the police.<br> Have you talked to Mendoza?<br> Yes. My brother has a contact at<br> a building site in Badalona.<br> They need lots of workers.<br> How much is this?<br> How much?<br> It's no laughing matter, Hai.<br> How much is it?<br> What's wrong with you? It's a<br> sensitive issue, and I have a family.<br> We aren't at home in China.<br> Thanks, I know.<br> Why did you come here then?<br> Because I love you.<br> You're a strong man.<br> An important man.<br> Do you love me?<br> Say you love me.<br> I know you love me.<br> How many times have I told you.<br> Am I speaking Chinese?<br> I have explained it to them ...<br> - They can't sell here, Uxbal.<br> You'd better fucking learn<br> to speak African.<br> You should also talk to your people<br> and get them to calm down.<br> That's what I pay you for.<br> Listen, Uxbal. We've known each other<br> for quite a while now.<br> But next time you screw up you<br> you're done.<br> Clear?<br> Is that clear?<br> Okay, moving on...<br> October and November.<br> Next time they pay late,<br> they're fucked.<br> Clear?<br> Or should I translate?<br> Daddy's home!<br> - Mom picked us up from school barefoot.<br> I took my shoes off too.<br> Well?<br> - Well what?<br> Why weren't you home?<br> - I can't be in two places at once.<br> Mom's making spaghetti.<br> Turn off the TV.<br> Sit down and eat.<br> Why is the shower on?<br> None of your shirts was ironed.<br> Neat way to iron, huh?<br> Coming to eat?<br> Lili called, she was worried.<br> We agreed that you would call<br> if you wanted to pick up the kids.<br> Sorry, but a client canceled.<br> Then call my cell!<br> Want some frittata?<br> It has apple in it.<br> It's like a potato frittata, but juicier,<br> and sweet. I bought it from Miguel.<br> Won't you eat something?<br> - No, I'm not hungry, honey.<br> Miguel's daughter told me<br> that they were out driving...<br> yesterday, when a motorbike cut them off<br> like a goddamned maniac.<br> So Miguel yelled: "Die, you idiot!"<br> Five minutes later, they saw the<br> bike lying on the road--<br> and the rider was completely crushed<br> in a pool of blood.<br> Miguel was so shaken<br> that he drove to the hospital.<br> I don't get why he was shocked. If anyone<br> did something like that to me...<br> Quiet, Maramba, enough already.<br> If you could stop talking,<br> maybe you'd get hungry.<br> Please put out your cigarette.<br> And take your foot off the table<br> while were eating.<br> Do you want to stay<br> and watch a movie, Mom?<br> It's late, sweetie.<br> If I don't say anything, how can I get you<br> to stop taking them to funerals?<br> Telepathy? That's why Mateo still<br> wets the bed.<br> I haven't taken them in a long time.<br> That's not what they say.<br> Just because you have custody...<br> Are you here to see the children,<br> or to interrogate them?<br> Mom, the spaghetti's tasteless.<br> You almost finished it anyway.<br> - Go.<br> Leave now.<br> Let us eat in peace.<br> I'd better go.<br> See you, sweetheart.<br> Be good, sweetheart.<br> Marambra...<br> Sorry. You did good.<br> I did good?<br> - Yes.<br> I don't need your praise.<br> I'm not a dog.<br> You turned the kids against me.<br> - No, Maramba, you do that yourself.<br> It's like it bothers you<br> to see me happy.<br> It's only with you that I find it hard<br> to be myself, and feel good.<br> Do you remember what happened<br> the last time you felt good?<br> Should I remind you?<br> You don't need to remind me.<br> Why are you laughing?<br> At least I laugh.<br> And I like seeing people smile.<br> I'm happy if I'm happy<br> and depressed if I'm depressed.<br> I just wanted to...<br> I love you.<br> I love you, I said.<br> Yes, me too.<br> You don't have any money on you?<br> A little more?<br> - No.<br> Maybe, now that you're selling the grave...<br> - Who told you that?<br> Tito.<br> - When did you see him?<br> Don't start, please. I gave him<br> a massage. He had a sore lower back.<br> It's not a grave, it's a niche.<br> But...<br> Nobody told me to fast.<br> Maybe...<br> it threw off the results.<br> No, sorry.<br> Fasting is merely a formality.<br> What now?<br> - Excuse me?<br> How...<br> I would like to know<br> what's going to happen.<br> It depends on how your body<br> responds to chemotherapy.<br> In your case,<br> it's been so long--<br> that it has metastasized from<br> prostate to bone and liver.<br> Which means...<br> But how long?<br> Roughly how long?<br> With medical treatment<br> we can maintain your quality of life--<br> for a few months.<br> Months?<br> Dad, I learned a trick.<br> Think of a country<br> that starts with D.<br> Dad, look at me.<br> Ready?<br> - Yes.<br> Now think of an animal<br> that starts with I.<br> Hippopotamus doesn't start with I.<br> Are you ready?<br> - Yes.<br> You're guaranteed to be thinking<br> of iguana and Denmark.<br> How'd you know?<br> Dad, how do you spell<br> "beautiful"?<br> Just the way it sounds.<br> - As in?<br> Biu-ti-ful.<br> No, it's nothing, don't worry.<br> Just get the kids,<br> and take them home to your place.<br> I don't know.<br> Until I'm released.<br> In a couple of days, probably.<br> Times are hard.<br> We'll stop making bags<br> and copying movies.<br> You were right.<br> Construction is good business.<br> The laborers will keep working<br> for Mendoza.<br> Pay them what we agreed.<br> You won't regret it.<br> We lend a helping hand...<br> and it's safer for us, too.<br> Do you understand? There's lots of money to be made.<br> Uxbal asked me for money<br> for heaters in the warehouse.<br> People shouldn't freeze in the basement.<br> Okay, I'll see what I can do.<br> Where are you going?<br> I gotta go home.<br> You came to blows<br> over to a negro?<br> How much was bail?<br> I'll pay it back,<br> as fast as I can.<br> Never mind. I'll take it from the money<br> we get for Dad's niche.<br> It's all set?<br> We just sign the papers<br> from the cemetery, and we get the money.<br> But first we have to cremate him.<br> Then we do what we want.<br> We can bury him in the urn with<br> Mom's ashes, and save money.<br> Have a look at these.<br> Careful, it's Dad's papers.<br> How are the Chinese at the site?<br> Mendoza's freaking out.<br> Most of them don't know<br> a damn thing about construction.<br> None of them speaks Spanish,<br> and they all look like alike.<br> Did you tell Marambra<br> about the cemetery?<br> No.<br> Well...<br> She called me a while ago. She called<br> trying to get a hold of you, or something...<br> but I didn't tell her anything.<br> I haven't seen her in a long time.<br> Uxbal.<br> Take it.<br> It's not necessary.<br> - I need to know what my son said.<br> The day before the accident<br> we'd quarreled.<br> It's the last thing I...<br> Your son died in peace.<br> He was scared so I helped him.<br> He told me<br> where he had hidden your watch.<br> Where?<br> Behind a leg, under his bed.<br> Yes.<br> I'm terribly sorry. Really.<br> Who is it?<br> - It's me.<br> I thought you were coming by tomorrow.<br> - I was nearby, so...<br> Come in.<br> Thanks for helping with the kids.<br> I can take them now...<br> Quiet.<br> The kids are sleeping.<br> - What did you tell them?<br> That you were with your brother.<br> That it was something to do with work.<br> I'll get them tomorrow<br> before they leave for school, okay?<br> You're welcome to stay here.<br> I can make coffee or tea.<br> There's also wine.<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> I swear, I haven't started drinking.<br> I opened the bottle for a friend.<br> You remember Laura?<br> Here you go.<br> Thank you.<br> Did they hurt you?<br> - No, I'm okay.<br> Ana told me about something<br> she'd dreamed.<br> You came home to the apartment,<br> and the bedroom was filled with sand.<br> Like a dune, which piled up<br> almost to the ceiling.<br> You climbed on top and began to dig...<br> - I'm leaving.<br> I asked her where Mateo was.<br> She didn't know...<br> but she thought<br> he lay buried under the sand.<br> Why are you leaving?<br> Stay here.<br> I think<br> you will look at me differently.<br> It's probably not a good idea.<br> We both know what will happen.<br> - There is room for all of us here.<br> You can see the ocean from the kitchen.<br> Then we'll have breakfast together,<br> like in the old days.<br> I'll make you toast with eggs...<br> Be quiet for a moment.<br> - The children need me.<br> They can't wake up to a<br> different father every weekend.<br> Always dredging up that crap.<br> It's not just about the kids.<br> I need you.<br> I haven't relapsed once<br> in five months.<br> Give me a chance, my love.<br> You've said the same thing<br> so many times.<br> I haven't been manic for a long time.<br> I'm different now, I promise.<br> Are you taking your pills?<br> You told me to stop taking them,<br> when I was breastfeeding Mateo.<br> You're obsessed with those damn pills!<br> The doctor said that you should...<br> The doctor would say anything<br> to get rid of me.<br> None of that shit can cure<br> my manic depression.<br> Now I'm trying with a light box.<br> - With what?<br> Phototherapy. It's fantastic.<br> And much cheaper than medicine.<br> Want to see it?<br> See?<br> Isn't it amazing?<br> I started a couple of months ago.<br> I feel wonderful.<br> But not like before.<br> It's different now.<br> I feel normal,<br> like everyone else.<br> No, stop...<br> Stop Marambra...<br> Please.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> You're very tired.<br> And I'm getting old.<br> - You're not; what are you talking about?<br> About me.<br> Away, at the police station,<br> I couldn't stop thinking about...<br> getting back to you<br> and the kids gain.<br> The kids and I need...<br> Do you remember when we<br> fucked in the small closet?<br> I'd just arrived in Barcelona, and<br> you visited me at work--the dry cleaner's.<br> You took me in the closet.<br> And then the owner came<br> and found us...<br> Get up!<br> It's half past seven.<br> There is bread and tea outside.<br> Come on!<br> I always find myself<br> in all kinds of crap.<br> There are four minors.<br> I don't pay in advance.<br> If we are inspected, where do I<br> hide so many damn Chinese?<br> It's our only condition, Mendoza.<br> I don't pay a thing until I know<br> whether they're worth anything.<br> That's normal practice.<br> Right, Uxbal?<br> One week's probation.<br> Half of them are sick and frozen.<br> They have never ever seen a drill before<br> in their lives.<br> That doesn't exactly help<br> to cut costs.<br> Costs...<br> Okay.<br> The alternative is to hire<br> unionized construction workers.<br> Once you've crunched the numbers,<br> call me.<br> When do you need the money?<br> - About a week from today.<br> Stop looking like a scared Chinaman.<br> I'll pay next week.<br> But then I need the papers<br> no later than Friday.<br> Okay, okay.<br> It's a deal.<br> - Good.<br> How long are we here for?<br> I don't know.<br> A couple of days.<br> Can I invite Lili?<br> It's too hard.<br> I can't take it anymore.<br> It smells horrible.<br> Maybe I should throw out the fish.<br> It's been thawed out again and again.<br> Don't touch the fridge when you're barefoot.<br> Especially if the floor is wet.<br> The power comes and goes.<br> The stairs are tough, right?<br> The neighbor's wife says that the stairs<br> helped her with her belly.<br> As if I couldn't see she'd had surgery<br> done. They cut her belly--<br> and pulled the skin so high,<br> her navel ended way up there.<br> The doctor had to make<br> her a fake belly button.<br> God...<br> Too bad there's no electricity,<br> after I just bought ice cream.<br> Have you tasted the mango? It's<br> wonderful. There's also chocolate.<br> Ana, get spoons.<br> Let's see. I bought you one<br> with chocolate chip cookies in it.<br> It melted.<br> - It tastes better that way.<br> Yummy.<br> Here.<br> Is that chocolate?<br> Don't be gross.<br> Careful.<br> Should we take a trip to the countryside<br> for Ana's birthday?<br> Just a weekend or a Saturday.<br> Sure. Where?<br> - I don't know.<br> The Pyrenees?<br> The kids have never seen snow.<br> They have never been<br> outside this neighborhood.<br> We can go camping.<br> One of my friends went.<br> No, I'd rather have a dog. A small one.<br> No, honey. They shit all day long<br> and cost a fortune.<br> Getting away is much more fun.<br> Let me try some.<br> I have to try it.<br> What are you doing, Marambra?<br> - Want a taste?<br> Use the spoon. Don't be so...<br> You are so disgusting.<br> Good, huh?<br> - Want to try it?<br> Go for it.<br> Stick your fingers in there.<br> Come on.<br> Good, right?<br> - Give it a rest.<br> You're one to talk. Don't you<br> remember how you proposed to me?<br> What did he do?<br> If you're telling the story,<br> tell about how you gazed at me.<br> You and your gazes.<br> I hadn't even seen you.<br> Hadn't even seen me?<br> - I'm the one telling the story, not you.<br> The day I met your father<br> at a party, he said--<br> that I had the most beautiful nose<br> he had ever seen.<br> And, of course, I believed him.<br> Then he took my hand<br> to read my palm.<br> He said I'd get married<br> to an insufferable man--<br> but I would be loved very much.<br> Who knows how many girls he'd tried<br> that on, but it worked on me.<br> He said if I let go of his hand,<br> it wouldn't come true.<br> And all of a sudden,<br> before I knew what was happening--<br> he lifted my hand<br> up to his nose--<br> and stuck my finger in his nostril.<br> He picked a booger<br> and put it in my hand--<br> so I would always carry<br> a part of him with me.<br> A black, hairy snot.<br> It was disgusting.<br> So you shouldn't say anything.<br> It's not true. Do you think I could've<br> thought of something like that?<br> What do you want?<br> Did you come to apologize?<br> Money?<br> Don't give me fucking money.<br> Apologize to them too.<br> Just seeing you...<br> If you didn't have kids, I'd kill you.<br> They knew what they were doing.<br> They didn't have residence permits,<br> and they sold drugs.<br> Ekweme and the others knew<br> they couldn't be here.<br> The police won't allow it.<br> Do you understand?<br> Take the damn money.<br> What about me?<br> What should I do with my child?<br> I don't know, Ige. I don't know.<br> Here. Drink this.<br> How's your wife?<br> Fine. Better.<br> And the kids?<br> - They're doing well.<br> And you?<br> You're dying.<br> So it seems.<br> Spit.<br> Have you taken stock of your life?<br> Are you ready to say goodbye?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> I'm working on it.<br> You think so?<br> You need to be sure.<br> Take control of your life.<br> Don't leave any loose ends.<br> I don't want to die, Bea.<br> I'm afraid<br> to leave the kids in the lurch.<br> Do you think you're the one<br> looking after the kids?<br> Don't be naive, Uxbal.<br> The universe will provide for them.<br> Yes, but the universe<br> doesn't pay the rent.<br> When I was on Ana's age--<br> my mother died.<br> I barely remember her.<br> My father died without me<br> ever meeting him.<br> I don't want that for my children.<br> Then tell them that.<br> Tell them everything.<br> The dead will never be at peace<br> if they are in debt to the living.<br> Why is this happening to me?<br> Am I being punished?<br> You can pack up and go--<br> or hang in there, like fools do.<br> It's a long hard road, Uxbal.<br> Death is not the end of everything,<br> you know that.<br> I won't die, Bea.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Yes, you'll die.<br> I see it,<br> and there's nothing I can do about it.<br> Get your affairs in order, Uxbal.<br> It's all that matters.<br> Chemotherapy is poison.<br> What did you eat for breakfast?<br> Coffee with milk.<br> You've always been such a sweet boy.<br> Remember what I said the day we met?<br> That we got our gift for free--<br> and we must pass it on likewise.<br> Here.<br> Give this to the kids when needed.<br> What is it?<br> - Protection.<br> When you must leave them--<br> give each of them one.<br> He said he felt<br> like a muddy sea inside.<br> That his eyes felt like jelly,<br> and his hair was on fire.<br> Get up. It's half past seven.<br> How many heaters did Uxbal bring?<br> - Six.<br> How's Ana?<br> Hi, Lili.<br> How are you?<br> The heaters will make sure<br> that you don't freeze.<br> Ana's fine.<br> She wants to see you.<br> We moved in with her mother,<br> and she misses you.<br> I miss her too.<br> She loves to play with Li.<br> Uxbal! Hai wants to talk to you.<br> See you, Lili.<br> - Bye. Say bye.<br> Not a day longer.<br> If I'd wanted them to sew 16 hours<br> a day and to exploit them...<br> Exploit them?<br> - Yes, exploit them.<br> Do you know what they earn in China?<br> Millions of Chinese would suck my dick<br> every morning to stay here.<br> You forget that it was I<br> who negotiated the workers' salaries.<br> And as I can see below,<br> they obviously get jack shit.<br> But it's none of my business.<br> Just give me my share.<br> We'd agreed...<br> Agreed what?<br> Agreed what?<br> You fucking asshole!<br> It's my money, asshole.<br> It's mine!<br> It's my money, dammit!<br> Mine!<br> Fucking leeches. If you're not<br> starving, it's because of me.<br> If those Chinese bastards have work,<br> it's because of me.<br> If the two of you are not sitting in jail,<br> it's because of me.<br> If you don't give me half<br> of Mendoza's money, I swear...<br> What will you do?<br> Who do you think you are?<br> You twist everything<br> for your own benefit.<br> Uxbal...<br> I'll be deported tomorrow.<br> You have to stay here with Samuel.<br> We're not staying here without you.<br> - Samuel is Spanish...<br> He's not. Samuel is Senegalese like me.<br> We'll go back with you.<br> We'll be united again.<br> We're still young.<br> Stay here.<br> Stay here with him<br> and get an education.<br> Go back to work at the chicken factory.<br> I'll send you money.<br> Even if I cut off the heads<br> of one million chickens--<br> we'll never afford a house here.<br> We don't belong here.<br> Why would you go back to Senegal?<br> There are no jobs at all.<br> A policeman came by.<br> He says we'll be evicted.<br> All of us. We have until Monday.<br> Let Uxbal handle it.<br> I trust him.<br> I have already spoken with him.<br> Let him help us.<br> Hello.<br> Why do you look so sulky?<br> What happened to you?<br> Why did you do it?<br> You didn't have to go that far.<br> Is that why you asked me to come?<br> To give me an earful?<br> What could I have done?<br> They do whatever the hell they want.<br> What did you expect?<br> Were you the only one who didn't know<br> that they sold drugs?<br> I warned you, Uxbal.<br> We had to stop the negroes.<br> There's not enough money for everyone.<br> Should I live on my miserable salary?<br> Or would you steal from me?<br> They're going to be deported.<br> There are women with small children...<br> You damn well aren't Mother Teresa.<br> - You know what I mean.<br> You're the one exploiting them,<br> so spare me the bullshit.<br> I don't exploit them.<br> I help them find work.<br> Upon payment, like everyone else.<br> Would you care for anything?<br> -No thanks.<br> Do you remember Victor, Julia's son?<br> He moved to Murcia to tame<br> tigers in a circus. He fed them.<br> They danced for him<br> and licked his face.<br> I saw the show<br> with my daughter.<br> She wanted a tiger to take home.<br> They seemed to love him.<br> Just last month, I saw Victor's mother.<br> One of the tigers had torn off<br> a piece of his face him, and killed him.<br> He fed them every day.<br> Every day for six years.<br> But he made one mistake.<br> It's dangerous to rely on<br> a starving man.<br> Let alone one whose children<br> are starving too.<br> That has nothing to do with it.<br> - What are you talking about then?<br> We have to help Ekweme.<br> He's being deported. You have to help me.<br> I don't sit in parliament.<br> I can't help you.<br> I can't fucking continue<br> to play United Nations.<br> I have a daughter to feed.<br> Do you understand?<br> Take care of yourself, Uxbal.<br> Or take an Alka Seltzer.<br> Chinese food can be toxic.<br> There are so many illegal workers<br> --that they end up living high off the hog<br> while we eat rice.<br> Dad, did you know--<br> that when an owl dies<br> it spits out a fur ball?<br> No, I didn't know.<br> Not so loud, you'll wake Mom.<br> Dad, is Mom mad at us?<br> No.<br> Who's that?<br> Your grandfather.<br> - Let me see.<br> This was the last photo taken of him<br> before he left.<br> My Mom always kept it in her purse.<br> Where'd he go?<br> To Mexico.<br> He didn't travel there, he fled.<br> - Why did he flee?<br> Because your grandfather couldn't<br> keep quiet.<br> Back then, Franco persecuted and executed<br> people who couldn't keep quiet.<br> When he was 20, he fled Spain<br> to avoid the death penalty--<br> but died two weeks later<br> in Mexico, of pneumonia.<br> Did you love him a lot?<br> I didn't know him.<br> I never met him.<br> It sucks not having a dad.<br> When are we going up to see the snow?<br> Mom says we should go by train.<br> Call the window seat.<br> - Okay.<br> If we are going up to the snow--<br> you have to start saving as much energy<br> as you can, because there's plenty to do.<br> Now off to bed.<br> Careful, it's heavy.<br> Damn, it's sealed with zinc.<br> Give me a hammer and chisel.<br> Dammit, he's embalmed.<br> We'll take it like that.<br> ...placed Mateo Fernandez Gama's remains--<br> in Dept. 27, Saint Joseph,<br> the year 1966.<br> Excellent. Everything's in order.<br> Your father died in Mexico.<br> That's why he was embalmed,<br> before being shipped here by boat.<br> I'm telling you this because<br> formaldehyde might cause--<br> the cremation to take longer.<br> The body will be driven to<br> the Montjuic crematorium.<br> You'll want to get an urn, I suppose.<br> Here are his personal effects.<br> They were in the coffin.<br> May we see the body?<br> If you want to,<br> but people normally wouldn't...<br> but if you want to, then I'll call<br> Montjuic right away.<br> Tony, please open the bag,<br> so the deceased can be identified.<br> Sorry, the door was open.<br> I'll be back shortly.<br> The fridge tends to hum--<br> but if you whack it on the back,<br> it'll stop.<br> There's hot water--<br> but it's best that you wait<br> to shower until after ten o'clock. Okay?<br> That's about everything.<br> Kids' room.<br> You can stay here, if you want.<br> The rent's been paid<br> for the next few months.<br> Damn.<br> Are you...?<br> Are you okay?<br> I didn't know you had massage clients<br> in the middle of the night.<br> You frightened me.<br> You should see the sky.<br> It's studded with stars.<br> It's fucking annoying that ants<br> always come crawling in here.<br> Ana says you caught them smoking<br> and that the mattress was on fire.<br> Where have you been?<br> - Don't I get to have a little fun?<br> Not with two children home alone--<br> who have no idea where you are.<br> And dressed like that.<br> So it's my fault? Now I have to<br> ask you for permission to be their mother.<br> This is what happens<br> when a seven year old smokes.<br> Things catch fire. Or maybe<br> you didn't know that Mateo smokes?<br> You mustn't leave them, or throw<br> a burning mattress out of the window--<br> and then force them to bring it<br> up again. He's only seven years old.<br> But he can already<br> hurt others like he was 40.<br> He wanted to open the fridge...<br> and his feet were wet.<br> And he called me a whore.<br> The more love I give him--<br> the more nasty names he calls me.<br> He said it was my fault we separated.<br> Did you hit him?<br> No.<br> Yes.<br> It's the only way he'll learn.<br> I bought train tickets.<br> Four seats in first class.<br> I found a cute guest house<br> where we can stay overnight.<br> The kids are so looking forward<br> to the trip.<br> They talk about the Pyrenees--<br> as if we were going to Disneyland.<br> Honey, what you're seeing there,<br> aren't stars.<br> It's your nervous system.<br> If you would only hold me...<br> We're ruined.<br> Finished.<br> We could've...<br> Calm down.<br> It was your idea.<br> What happened?<br> Where are they?<br> Where are they?<br> - You fucking pig!<br> You're a fucking murderer.<br> - Shut the fuck up!<br> It was your idea too.<br> - We gotta go.<br> I don't want to go to jail.<br> - No one's going anywhere.<br> Where are they?<br> Downstairs. In the basement.<br> We have to decide what to do<br> with the one who's alive.<br> There's one whose alive?<br> There were two, but we couldn't...<br> One already died.<br> Reporting this would be suicide.<br> Promise me<br> that nobody will find out.<br> I'll give you all the money<br> you want. Just say how much.<br> Help me, help me.<br> What are you doing?<br> Help me!<br> Uxbal, let her be. She's dead.<br> What do we do?<br> You have to help me.<br> I don't know.<br> Lock the damn warehouse.<br> Wait, Marambra.<br> Please Marambra, listen to me.<br> Listen to me for a moment.<br> Take the train tonight;<br> We'll see again tomorrow.<br> Don't change the plan.<br> Don't change a damn thing.<br> Take the kids,<br> and head for the Pyrenees.<br> Yes, tell Ana that I'm sorry, that we'll<br> celebrate her birthday when you get back.<br> I tried to pray, but I don't know<br> who to pray to.<br> You haven't slept at all, have you?<br> Out with it.<br> I bought the damn heaters<br> because they were the cheapest.<br> Because I needed the fucking money.<br> I knew full well<br> that the heaters were bad.<br> It's my fault, Bea.<br> It's my fault, it's all...<br> They're all dead...<br> There were women there.<br> And children...<br> Lili was there.<br> I wanted to ask her to forgive me,<br> but she was already dead.<br> I don't know if I should go to<br> police. I'm really scared...<br> It was an accident, Uxbal.<br> Take it easy.<br> You know what to do, Uxbal.<br> Go find them--<br> and beg their forgiveness.<br> No, not that...<br> Not that...<br> Tito...<br> Here comes the prodigal son.<br> What happened to you?<br> I've been trying to reach you.<br> I left a thousand messages.<br> Why aren't you taking my calls?<br> Why aren't you taking my calls?<br> - Come here.<br> This is my long-lost brother.<br> What are you having?<br> I don't know.<br> - Clara!<br> Mendoza went nuts.<br> He almost cut my balls off.<br> Clara, one...<br> Two Jack Daniels.<br> The Chinese didn't show up for work.<br> These kinds of delays cost a fortune.<br> What happened?<br> - There was a problem, Tito.<br> What the hell?<br> Why didn't you come to me?<br> Because...<br> I don't know.<br> Come here, Clarita.<br> Drink, we'll talk about this tomorrow.<br> Listen...<br> I've got to talk to you, Tito.<br> Here, you've got to yell<br> or touch each other.<br> Check her out.<br> Damn, you were thirsty.<br> Look behind me. The girl in pink.<br> I fucked her in the ass.<br> She loves cock.<br> She's just a little girl.<br> Cheers!<br> I don't have anything.<br> Here it is.<br> Is Chepas here?<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Look at him.<br> How long is it<br> since you last went out?<br> It's been at least two years.<br> Look at him now.<br> He looks like the fucking Dalai Lama.<br> Here.<br> Hello, beautiful.<br> No, don't give him anything.<br> Let him suffer.<br> Look at him.<br> Now we can talk.<br> Want something to drink?<br> Get Chepas's stuff.<br> I'm going to the restroom.<br> Are you looking to party, girls?<br> - What for? We know you're gay.<br> Your brother's an idiot.<br> Do you know that?<br> Your brother's an idiot.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, he is.<br> How many kids do you have?<br> How many kids do you have?<br> - Two.<br> Where are they now?<br> - They went away.<br> They went up to the snow.<br> Who with?<br> - With their mother.<br> Why didn't you go with them?<br> - I can't.<br> Why can't you?<br> Why can't you?<br> Because I'm dying.<br> I'm dying of cancer.<br> PYRENEES are BlUTlFUL<br> Mateo. Sweetie?<br> Mateo.<br> Little buddy...<br> Why are you here all alone?<br> I peed my pants.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> What happened?<br> Mommy punished me.<br> She left me here.<br> She only took Ana.<br> They went up to the snow.<br> What happened to your face?<br> I've been very bad.<br> Dad...<br> Dad...<br> Let me explain.<br> It was Ana's birthday and Mateo...<br> - Don't talk to me, Marambra.<br> It's good that you're leaving.<br> I'm really glad you're clearing out.<br> You hear me?<br> You son of a bitch!<br> You are a fucking son of a bitch!<br> You can't even look at me, huh?<br> Give me the picture, Marambra.<br> Come on, Mateo.<br> The children are staying here.<br> I'll pick up their things later.<br> You can't take Mateo.<br> I'm telling you right now.<br> Come on, sweetie.<br> Please let him stay.<br> - Let go of him now.<br> Let him stay.

Let go of Mateo!<br> Let go, Marambra.<br> I can't.<br> Let him go, dammit!<br> Marambra, let go of Mateo.<br> Let him go. Let him go.<br> Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.<br> Ana. Ana!<br> Take your fucking ring!<br> You can have the kids' room.<br> We'll be moving into mine.<br> How old is he?<br> A year and two months.<br> I mean, it'll be<br> two months in four days.<br> His name is Samuel.<br> Named for Eto'o?<br> - Yes.<br> Ekweme was Barcelona fan.<br> - Who is Ekweme?<br> His father.<br> Tell him to be quiet.<br> Make him stop.<br> Go to sleep, Mateo.<br> Daddy, why is Ige living with us?<br> Because she doesn't have a home.<br> And she has a little kid.<br> Should I answer it?<br> - No, I already told you.<br> Where are the kids?<br> I dropped them off at school.<br> Why didn't you wake me?<br> - You were sleeping like a log.<br> Ana said she knew the way,<br> and it was fine for Mateo.<br> What time is it?<br> I don't know.<br> It must be around one.<br> I can pick up the kids,<br> if you like.<br> He lost his mind.<br> Liwei betrayed me.<br> The whole thing was his idea.<br> You yourself knew<br> what kind of man he was.<br> He dumped the dead bodies<br> Shimuya swore<br> the corpses sank to the bottom.<br> Liwei thought you would betray us.<br> I was scared, too.<br> They have taken my family.<br> My daughter, Suyin.<br> To cap it all, Liwei came to me--<br> crying like he'd been whipped.<br> This is insane. I don't get it.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> What do you want me to do?<br> We can't stay here.<br> Get out of here, as fast as you can.<br> What do you want?<br> - You are not innocent, Uxbal.<br> What?<br> - Don't play dumb.<br> You have to try to put a lid on it.<br> My family won't talk, I swear.<br> You have to hush up anyone you know<br> who knows anything.<br> The news has shocked the entire nation.<br> The latest news is that the<br> vast majority of victims were men--<br> but among them were the bodies<br> of two women and three children.<br> These images might be unpleasant for some.<br> The search for bodies continues...<br> No, I don't know.<br> It's not clear.<br> No, it's not clear.<br> What? Really?<br> Near the Chinese warehouse.<br> Damned if I know.<br> A family, or something.<br> Hang on, someone's at the door.<br> No, no, no!<br> Don't hang up.<br> What the hell are you doing here?<br> I just heard.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> Are we talking about the same thing?<br> - I don't know.<br> Are we talking about the same thing?<br> This sucks ass.<br> Want something to drink?<br> Marambra's bag?<br> - Give it a rest.<br> I don't get it at all.<br> They murdered them, Uxbal?<br> You fucking pig.<br> Damn, Uxbal...<br> You pig.<br> She was hysterical,<br> standing there and crying.<br> What was I supposed to do?<br> Leave her standing outside?<br> You're partly to blame, Uxbal.<br> If I see you near my wife, or my kids--<br> anywhere less than a kilometer away--<br> I swear on our mother--<br> I'll kill you.<br> I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.<br> I can't move.<br> I feel like if I moved my neck--<br> my head would fall off.<br> Easy. Nothing's going to fall off.<br> If I close my eyes--<br> the thoughts come.<br> They scare me so much.<br> I called you.<br> I called you several times.<br> I can't give the children what they need.<br> I'm so sorry I was mean to Mateo.<br> I do what I can to survive.<br> I want to be faithful.<br> But I also want to have some fun...<br> like a whore.<br> Don't say that, Marambra.<br> Forgive me.<br> I never knew how to help you.<br> I still don't know.<br> Something...<br> I've never known.<br> But we've hurt each other so much.<br> Send me away again.<br> At the clinic<br> they have to strap me in tight...<br> Easy.<br> Easy. It's going to be okay.<br> Going to be okay.<br> She is at the same place<br> where we visited her before.<br> Do you remember?<br> And she...<br> We must give her space to rest.<br> Are they taking care of her?<br> -Yes.<br> She has 2O people taking care of her.<br> She sends you many kisses.<br> She loves you very much.<br> Can we visit her?<br> -Yes, of course, sweetie.<br> But right now we must let her rest.<br> Make a wish, honey.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Don't stick it up your nose.<br> -Give me your hand.<br> What's this? A booger?<br> This is a gift from your dad.<br> Will you take good care of it?<br> You promise?<br> Will you take good care of it?<br> - Yes.<br> Should we have some cake now?<br> Sit down, Ige.<br> Well...<br> The first thing to do...<br> Mateo, don't be gross.<br> is to eat<br> this delicious chocolate cake.<br> The kids are very fond of you, Ige.<br> You and Samuel.<br> You have a home here.<br> And you can stay for as long as you want.<br> No, Uxbal.<br> I'm very fond of the children too--<br> but when I've scraped together<br> enough money, I'll go back.<br> This is no place for us.<br> Ekweme told me that...<br> Wait a minute.<br> This is enough for rent for a whole year--<br> and much more.<br> It's all for the children.<br> Do you understand?<br> Take the money, Ige. Take them.<br> Take them.<br> Ige, please...<br> Can't you stay here, please?<br> I need your help.<br> Take the money. Take them.<br> Damn...<br> What is it?<br> Nothing.<br> Why aren't you in school?<br> -Don't lie to me, Daddy.<br> Come here.<br> Does your brother know anything about this?<br> You can't leave us.<br> I won't.<br> Look into my eyes.<br> Look at my face.<br> Promise me you'll remember me.<br> Don't forget me, Ana.<br> Don't forget me, my darling.<br> Goodbye.<br> Ige?<br> Ige?<br> Yes, it's me.<br> I came back.<br> Daddy, are you okay?<br> Yes, dear.<br> Does it hurt?<br> No.<br> I can't sleep.<br> Turn on the light.<br> The ring looks funny on your hand.<br> Can I see it?<br> Is it real?<br> - Yes.<br> At least that's what my father<br> told my mother.<br> Why do you have it?<br> Because...<br> your grandfather gave it to your grandmother...<br> before he left Spain...<br> She was pregnant and expecting me--<br> and she never saw him again.<br> It's beautiful. I never imagined<br> I'd touch a real diamond.<br> Can I try it on?<br> - Yes.<br> It's yours now, sweetie.<br> - Really?<br> Mom always wore it on this finger.<br> She said it wasn't real.<br> Your mother never heard the sound.<br> What sound?<br> The sound of the ocean.<br> When I was little--<br> one radio station<br> played the sounds of the sea.<br> Giant waves.<br> The sounds scared me.<br> Why were you scared?<br> The bottom of the sea scared me.<br> Did you know that when an owl dies,<br> it spits out a fur ball?<br> All the creatures that live there.<br> You shouldn't go with the ponytail.<br> It makes you look like a fox.<br> It scares away the owls.<br> Dad?<br> Dad?<br> Don't you believe me?<br> Dad?<br> Once there was nothing here.<br> Just water. Saltwater.<br> Do you know what it sounded like?<br> And the wind?<br> And the two together?<br> What's over there?<br> Dedicated to my beautiful old oak tree,<br> Hctor Gonzlez Gama, my father<br> :o3<br> subs by scroungehound<br>
