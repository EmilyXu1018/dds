                        There.<br> Technicals, nine o'clock.<br> Oh, shit! Did you see that?<br> Chief, we got unarmed civilians<br> getting shot down here at nine o'clock.<br> I got it, Matt.<br> I don't think we can touch this.<br> Command, Super 64...<br> ...we got militia shooting civilians<br> at the food distribution centre.<br> Request permission to engage.<br> Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.<br> Negative, command.<br> U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64.<br> We cannot intervene.<br> -Return to base. Over.<br> -Roger.<br> Leaving.<br> General Garrison?<br> No, thanks. I got one.<br> But these are Cuban.<br> Bolivar Belicoso.<br> So is this.<br> Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.<br> I see not catching Aidid<br> is becoming a routine.<br> We weren't trying to catch Aidid.<br> We were trying to catch you.<br> Me?<br> But am I that important?<br> I hardly think so.<br> -You're just a businessman.<br> -Trying to make a living.<br> Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.<br> You've been here, what?<br> Six weeks?<br> Six weeks<br> you are trying to catch the general.<br> You put up reward posters.<br> $25,000. What is this?<br> Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?<br> It's the O.K. Corral.<br> Do you think bringing me in<br> will make him suddenly come to you?<br> Make him more agreeable?<br> You know where he sleeps.<br> You pay for his beds, much less his militia.<br> We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.<br> And we will find him.<br> Don't think because I grew up<br> without running water...<br> ...I am simple, General.<br> I do know something about history.<br> See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.<br> A tomorrow without a lot<br> of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.<br> Well, I wouldn't know about that.<br> I'm from Texas.<br> Mr. Garrison,<br> I think you shouldn't have come here.<br> This is civil war.<br> This is our war.<br> Not yours.<br> That's not a war, Mr. Atto.<br> That's genocide.<br> Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?<br> How'd he strike you?<br> Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.<br> Yeah, he's a good catch.<br> It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.<br> I'm not sure time is something we got<br> in great supply.<br> This isn't Iraq, you know.<br> Much more complicated than that.<br> Boss, most of Washington might disagree.<br> They've been calling for situation reports<br> every morning this week.<br> Well, tell them the situation is fragile.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.<br> I'll be your pilot today.<br> Federal regulations designate this<br> a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.<br> Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program<br> will earn 100 free credits.<br> And as always, the air sickness bags<br> are in the seatback in front of you.<br> Number one indications are good, Cliff.<br> Put her on two.<br> You're still clear.<br> I've got some bad news.<br> "Limo" is a word, Durant.<br> I don't want to hear about it.<br> It is not a word.<br> It's an abbreviation of a word.<br> "Limo" is a word in common usage.<br> That is the key phrase in Scrabble,<br> my good friend. Common usage.<br> If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!<br> It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!<br> It does have to be in the dictionary!<br> When we get back to the base,<br> it's coming off.<br> You touch my "limo"<br> and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.<br> Yeah, promises.<br> That's a nice beach down there.<br> How's the water?<br> Yeah, it's nice and warm.<br> And it's loaded with sharks.<br> -Name.<br> -Todd.<br> -Last name.<br> -Blackburn.<br> First name, Todd.<br> -So, what's it like?<br> -What's what like?<br> Mogadishu. The fighting.<br> -Serial number.<br> -72163427.<br> Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."<br> No one calls it Mogadishu here.<br> Secondly, I wouldn't know<br> about the fighting, so don't ask.<br> Why not?<br> Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?<br> You look like you're about 12,<br> so let me explain something to you.<br> I have a rare and mysterious skill<br> that precludes me from doing missions.<br> Typing.<br> -Can you type?<br> -No.<br> -Date of birth.<br> -2-27-75.<br> Well, I'm here to kick some ass.<br> Let's bring it in.<br> Nice, man! Very smooth!<br> Single shot through the engine block.<br> Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.<br> Cease fire! Cease fire!<br> Check your weapons!<br> Sergeant Eversmann.<br> Private First Class Blackburn.<br> Yeah?<br> Reporting for duty.<br> Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.<br> He should be here somewhere.<br> Can I leave him with you?<br> Yeah, go ahead.<br> -You brought your weapon.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Want me to shoot? I'm rested.<br> -When did you get in?<br> -Just now, Sergeant.<br> Hey, who's hungry?<br> What is this, Sarg'nt?<br> Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?<br> -Not if General Garrison is asking.<br> -I'm asking.<br> Have a nice meal, Captain.<br> -Hey, man, there's a line.<br> -I know.<br> -Well, this isn't the back of it.<br> -Yeah, I know.<br> Sergeant. Sergeant.<br> What's going on here?<br> Some aerial target practice, sir.<br> Didn't want to leave it behind.<br> I'm talking about your weapon.<br> Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.<br> You know better than that.<br> Safety should be on at all times on base.<br> Well, this is my safety, sir.<br> Let it go, sir.<br> The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.<br> You Delta boys<br> are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.<br> Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.<br> When we get on a five-yard line,<br> you're going to need my Rangers.<br> Y'all better learn to be team players.<br> We're done here.<br> Speak up. You say this is your safety?<br> Well, this is my boot, son.<br> And it will fit up your ass<br> with the proper amount of force.<br> -Is that a Jersey accent?<br> -I'm trying to do this, give me a break.<br> Take those sunglasses off.<br> Delta wants to wear Oakleys,<br> that's their business.<br> I don't want to see them on you again.<br> Is that a hot weapon?<br> Is that your move?<br> Is my hand on the piece?<br> I can mate you in three whatever you do.<br> I'd keep my eye on that queen<br> before counselling others.<br> Well, she's just lying in wait.<br> Yikes.<br> It's good. You're really improving.<br> If I may make a suggestion... Observation.<br> Go ahead.<br> -It's a children's book, right?<br> -Right.<br> They are not supposed to scare<br> the living shit out of the children.<br> This is the part of the story<br> where our knight is slaying the dragon.<br> That's scary.<br> Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.<br> Thought you finished that last week.<br> You done?<br> Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.<br> You understand?<br> Can you count? One, two, ten.<br> Okay? Where are my running backs?<br> Where are my running backs?<br> Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.<br> You had something more important to do?<br> Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.<br> I will make you believe, you understand?<br> Pretty funny, hoo-ah?<br> It was a good impression.<br> I recognize myself.<br> All right, carry on.<br> -I'd like a word, specialist.<br> -Sir.<br> You understand why we have<br> a chain of command, don't you?<br> Roger that, sir.<br> If you ever undermine me again,<br> you'll clean latrines with your tongue...<br> ...till you taste no difference<br> between shit and French fries.<br> -Are we clear?<br> -Hoo-ah, sir.<br> All right.<br> Listen to this:<br> If one skinny kills another his clan owes<br> the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.<br> A hundred camels.<br> Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.<br> Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.<br> Is that really true, Lieutenant?<br> Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.<br> Sgt. Eversmann,<br> you really like the skinnies?<br> It's not that I like them or I don't like them.<br> I respect them.<br> See, what you guys fail to realize<br> is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.<br> He believes in this mission<br> down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?<br> Look, these people, they have no jobs...<br> ...no food, no education, no future.<br> I just figure that, I mean,<br> we have two things that we can do.<br> We can help...<br> ...or we can sit back and watch<br> the country destroy itself on CNN.<br> Right?<br> I don't know about you guys,<br> but I was trained to fight.<br> Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?<br> Well, I think I was trained<br> to make a difference, Kurth.<br> Like the man said, he's an idealist.<br> Oh, wait. This is my favourite part.<br> Stay away from the cans!<br> Die, gas-pumper!<br> Stay away from those cans!<br> No, no, stay back.<br> He's having a seizure.<br> Put something in his mouth.<br> John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.<br> Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.<br> He's out of the game.<br> He's epileptic, going home.<br> I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.<br> -You got a problem with that?<br> -No, sir.<br> It's a big responsibility.<br> Your men will look to you<br> to make the right decisions.<br> They're lives depend on it.<br> All right.<br> -Rangers lead the way, sir.<br> -All the way.<br> Good luck.<br> A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet<br> may take place today at 1500 hours.<br> I say "may" because we all know by now...<br> ...with the intel we get on the street,<br> nothing is certain.<br> This is actual intel<br> confirmed by three sources.<br> Two tier-one personalities may be present:<br> Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...<br> ...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.<br> These are the guys we're after.<br> Today we go.<br> Same mission template as before.<br> will infiltrate the target building...<br> ...and seize all suspects within.<br> Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,<br> under command of Capt. Steele...<br> ...will rope in at 1546...<br> ...and hold a four-corner perimeter<br> around the target building.<br> No one gets in or out.<br> Extraction Force:<br> Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column<br> will drive in at 1547...<br> ...on Hawlwadig Road<br> and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.<br> Wait for the green light.<br> Now once Delta gives the word...<br> ...McKnight's column will go to the target<br> and load the prisoners onto trucks.<br> Immediately after<br> the prisoners are loaded...<br> ...the four Ranger chalks<br> will collapse back to the target building...<br> ...Ioad up on humvees...<br> ...and the entire ground force<br> will exfil the 3 miles back to base.<br> Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.<br> Now, I had requested light armour<br> and AC-130 Spectre gunships...<br> ...but Washington, in all its wisdom,<br> decided against this.<br> Too high-profile.<br> So Black Hawks and Little Birds<br> will provide the air cover...<br> ...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.<br> Colonel Harrell.<br> In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews<br> will coordinate the air mission...<br> ...and I will coordinate ground forces.<br> Colonel Matthews.<br> Mission launch code word is Irene.<br> Questions?<br> Which building is it, sir?<br> We're confirming that now.<br> Somewhere near the Bakara market.<br> I don't choose the time or place<br> of their meetings.<br> I didn't say a word, sir.<br> Make no mistake,<br> once you're in the Bakara market...<br> ...you're in an entirely hostile district.<br> Don't underestimate their capabilities.<br> We'll be in friendly neighbourhoods<br> before we hit the market...<br> ...so remember the rules of engagement:<br> No one fires unless fired upon.<br> Now, let's go get this thing done.<br> Good luck, gentlemen.<br> What's the matter, Danny?<br> Something you don't like?<br> No Spectre gunships,<br> daylight instead of night...<br> ...afternoon when they're all fucked up<br> on khat...<br> ...only part of the city Aidid can mount<br> a counter-attack on short notice...<br> -What's not to like?<br> -Life's imperfect.<br> For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,<br> it's imperfect.<br> Down in the street, it's unforgiving.<br> What the fuck, Smith?<br> -Well?<br> -Well, what?<br> We going?<br> -Why should I tell you that?<br> -Because I'm me.<br> Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.<br> -Bakara market.<br> -All right.<br> Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up<br> out there today, all right?<br> Keep sharp.<br> Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.<br> Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.<br> Nothing.<br> It's all in the grind, Sizemore.<br> Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.<br> This, my friend, is a science.<br> You're looking at the guy<br> that believed the commercials.<br> About "be all you can be."<br> I made coffee through Desert Storm.<br> I made coffee through Panama,<br> while everyone else got to fight...<br> ...got to be a Ranger.<br> Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"<br> or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"<br> -What happened to you?<br> -Ping-Pong accident.<br> What?<br> So guess what.<br> Your wish has been granted.<br> You're going out today.<br> You're fucking me.<br> You're taking my place<br> assisting the 60 gunner.<br> Sergeant Eversmann said<br> to get your stuff and get ready.<br> It's what you wanted, isn't it?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Hell, yeah.<br> Grimesy, stick with Waddell<br> and give him ammo when he needs it.<br> -Hoo-ah?<br> -Hoo-ah.<br> I wouldn't worry about that. Generally<br> speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.<br> Just watch out for the sammys<br> throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.<br> Might even be fun.<br> D-boys do their thing now.<br> All we got to do is cover them.<br> Choppers going to cover us,<br> and we'll be all right.<br> Look, you guys,<br> this is my first time as chalk leader...<br> ...but, this isn't our first time out together.<br> This is serious.<br> We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.<br> We're elite.<br> Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?<br> Any questions?<br> We're going to be okay.<br> Grab your gear. Let's move out.<br> You're not going to need that, dude.<br> We're not out there long enough.<br> You won't need that, either.<br> We'll be back before dark.<br> You might as well take dope<br> and beer instead.<br> What?<br> Ammo, dude. Take ammo.<br> Let me tell you something, Grimes.<br> You got 50 pounds of gear.<br> You don't need another 12.<br> I don't know about you,<br> I don't plan on getting shot running away.<br> Well, I better keep mine in.<br> Grimes.<br> Most important thing:<br> Remember, when everyone is shooting,<br> shoot in the same direction.<br> Look at this.<br> He's taping his blood type to his boots.<br> -That's bad luck.<br> -No, it's smart.<br> All Delta do that.<br> That's bad luck too, man.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> It's a good thing<br> you're right-handed, Adonis.<br> -lf not, I don't know what you'd do.<br> -You're a funny guy, man.<br> -I'm not taking no death letter.<br> -We have a deal.<br> I'll give it to you back in an hour.<br> -Blackburn, you okay?<br> -Excited.<br> In a good way.<br> I've been training my whole life for this.<br> You ever shot at anybody before?<br> No, sir.<br> Me neither.<br> Think he's reliable?<br> Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.<br> -Tell him to turn his damn radio off.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> Tell him to turn his radio off.<br> Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.<br> Hi.

It's my fault.<br> -We need to get out of here!<br> -That way.<br> We can't be far from the crash.<br> Which way?<br> I thought you might know.<br> Let's move out.<br> Nelson, Twombly? Come in.

You okay?<br> Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Go!<br> A crowd is advancing six,<br> seven blocks from the crash.<br> Shughart and Gordon<br> again request permission...<br> ...to secure until convoy arrives. Over.<br> General, crowds are in the hundreds now.<br> From where they are,<br> they can see things clearer than any of us.<br> They know what they're asking.<br> Let me talk to them.<br> This is Garrison.<br> I want to make sure that you understand<br> what you're asking, so say it out loud.<br> We're asking to go in and set up<br> a perimeter until ground support arrives.<br> You realize that I cannot tell you<br> when that might be, it could take a while.<br> -Roger that.<br> -You still want to go in there?<br> Yes, sir.<br> -Colonel Harrell?<br> -Yes, General?<br> It's your call.<br> Roger that.<br> Goffena, put them in.<br> Motherfucker.

Cover!<br> Wait, l...<br> I'm putting you down.<br> C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,<br> securing perimeter.<br> -You all right?<br> -Yeah, I'm good.<br> You're locked and loaded.<br> Any skinnies come around these corners,<br> you watch our backs.<br> -Where's the rescue squad?<br> -We're it.<br> All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.<br> Son of a bitch.<br> Romeo 64, we're back where we started.<br> I'm low on ammo,<br> I got many wounded including me...<br> ...vehicles that are barely running.<br> Okay, Danny,<br> I need a no-b.s. assessment here.<br> Can you get to the crash site?<br> Colonel, I can't see shit.<br> Negative.<br> With the amount of wounded we have,<br> we'd do more harm than good.<br> We need to come back to base, rearm<br> and regroup and then we can go back out.<br> Roger.<br> C-2, bring them back.<br> Get them out of there.<br> Roger. Return to base.<br> We're going home!<br> Let's go. Left.<br> Roger that. Understand.<br> Convoy returning to base.<br> -What's up?<br> -They're sending them back.<br> The convoy's headed back to base camp.<br> Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?<br> We need to exfil the wounded now<br> and get out of here before it's too late!<br> If Colonel McKnight went back to base,<br> then he had a good reason.<br> It changes nothing.<br> All right, listen up.<br> We're going to hold the perimeter<br> and we're going to hold the strongpoint.<br> Conserve your ammo.<br> Only shoot at what you can hit.<br> The convoy is going to come.<br> We're going to get home.<br> Loading!<br> Loading!<br> Randy, I need a pistol mag!<br> Loading!<br> Randy, last mag!<br> Gordy!<br> Fuck!<br> Gordy is gone, man.

Get down! Get down!<br> Stay with me.<br> You just got a bullet in the leg.<br> See where those tires are burning?<br> All that black smoke?<br> Roger. I can see it,<br> but I can't get there. Over.<br> Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.<br> Negative. You don't understand.<br> It's roadblock after roadblock.<br> You have to find us another route. Over.<br> There ain't one. The only other route is<br> all the way around the city.<br> Roger that.<br> Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.<br> Request permission to move<br> to crash site number two on foot. Over.<br> Green light, Kilo 11.<br> Stop the vehicle. Let me out.<br> After I'm finished with this,<br> I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.<br> The usual. Blended, no salt.<br> This is Kilo 12.<br> We've got to change our position. Over.<br> Eversmann, come in.<br> Eversmann.<br> -Roger who is this?<br> -Sanderson.<br> Do not...

I got him.<br> I want direct pressure on the wound.<br> It's going to be all right.<br> This is Kilo 11.<br> I'm at the Durant crash site.<br> Roger that.<br> Crash site two secured.<br> Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.<br> Cribbs?<br> -They're still debating the route.<br> -How long?<br> At least a couple of hours.<br> We haven't got that long, Joe.<br> Pakistani General says, since<br> we didn't deign to inform him of the raid...<br> ...it'll take some time to mobilize<br> the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.<br> You tell the general this:<br> I understand,<br> but it is my duty to remind him...<br> ...that my men are surrounded<br> by thousands of armed Somali militia.<br> It's imperative that we move them out<br> of the hostile area and into the safe zone.<br> I need his help now.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Durant.<br> Michael Durant.<br> Yes.<br> You are the Ranger who kills my people?<br> I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.<br> That's right.<br> None of you Americans smoke anymore.<br> You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.<br> What do you want with me?<br> You have taken hostages.<br> We have you.<br> My government<br> will never negotiate for me.<br> Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?<br> Soldier to soldier.<br> I'm not in charge.<br> Course not. You have the power to kill,<br> but not negotiate.<br> In Somalia, killing is negotiation.<br> Do you really think<br> if you get General Aidid...<br> ...we will simply put down our weapons...<br> ...and adopt American democracy?<br> That the killing will stop?<br> We know this:<br> Without victory, there can be no peace.<br> There will always be killing, you see?<br> This is how things are in our world.<br> Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.<br> Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.<br> You got to take over from me. Both hands.<br> It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it.<br> Which means that<br> it's retracted up into the pelvis.<br> I have to find it and clamp it.<br> It's the only way to stop the bleeding.<br> I got no more IVs.<br> So, I'm going to need you to assist. Okay?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> Now listen, Jamie.<br> I got to do something, it's going to hurt.<br> I got to cause you more pain,<br> but I have to do it to help you.<br> All right, you understand?<br> -Morphine.<br> -I can't.<br> It'll lower your heart rate too far.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Twombly, why don't you take his hands?<br> Hold the wound open,<br> keep pressure on the top of the leg.<br> Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.<br> On my count.<br> All right, Jamie. All right.<br> One. Two.<br> Three.<br> Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.<br> I feel the pulse.<br> I got it. I got it.<br> I got it, yeah.

What, you think I'm kidding?<br> -Is anybody hit?<br> -We're good!<br> You all right?<br> Yeah!<br> Is everybody all right?<br> Yeah!<br> Incoming!<br> DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!<br> Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.<br> Chalk Four. We're at the southeast corner<br> of the crash. Who's this?<br> This is Hoot.<br> I'm coming with three friendlies.<br> I need cover fire. Over.<br> Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!<br> Deltas coming in.<br> Hold your fire! Hold your fire!<br> Ground personnel will have to mark<br> target positions with infrared strobes.<br> Get Little Birds on strafing runs<br> and keep them going all night long.<br> If we don't hold back this city...<br> ...we'll have a 100 caskets<br> to fill by morning.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Colonel Harrell,<br> ground personnel at crash site one...<br> ...will have to mark the target<br> with infrared strobes to prep for air strike.<br> McKnight.<br> Between the 10th Mountain and U.N.,<br> we got enough personnel, okay?<br> Danny, you guys do not have<br> to go back out again.<br> I can't die here, man.<br> You're not going to die, all right?<br> You're not going to die.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You don't have anything to be sorry for.<br> You saved Twombly. You did perfect.<br> You okay, Twombs?<br> Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.<br> You did what you were trained to do.<br> You should be proud of that.<br> Be proud of that.<br> -Ev?<br> -Yeah.<br> Do me a favour.<br> You tell my parents<br> that I fought well today.<br> And that I fought hard.<br> You're going to tell them yourself, okay?<br> Do you hear me?<br> All right?<br> -Are the humvees here?<br> -They're coming, Jamie.<br> They're coming.<br> You just got to hang in there a little bit.<br> -You hold on for just a little bit.<br> -I can.<br> I can.<br> It's nothing.<br> It's nothing.<br> It's nothing.<br> -It's nothing.<br> -It's nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Hold the wound.<br> Doc.<br> Doc.<br> It's okay.<br> What are you doing?<br> We need the ammo.<br> You did all you could here.<br> They should've sent a medivac.<br> Right now we'd be out there<br> defending another crashed chopper.<br> More men would get torn up.<br> Maybe.<br> See, you're thinking. Don't.<br> Because, Sergeant, you can't control<br> who gets hit or who doesn't.<br> Who falls out of a chopper or why.<br> It ain't up to you. It's just war.<br> Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.<br> -This all happened because Blackburn fell.<br> -Should have, could have, don't matter.<br> You'll get plenty of time<br> to think about all that later. Believe me.<br> Sergeant, you got your men this far.<br> You did it right today.<br> You need to start thinking about<br> getting these men out of here.<br> Well, shall we?<br> I need four guys in this corner now!<br> RPG!<br> This is Barber 52 in position for gun run.<br> Jesus Christ. Look at that.<br> This is 25! I can see you.<br> You're right above me.<br> Eversmann, I can't tell who's who<br> down there. Too much activity.<br> I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.<br> Roger that.<br> You see it?<br> Nah, I can't see shit.<br> -I'm putting it on the roof.<br> -You're going to need help!<br> Cover me.<br> Okay, guys, we're going to lay down<br> some cover fire for him on three!<br> Ready?<br> One.<br> Two.<br> Three. Go!<br> I got your position. I got the target.<br> We're inbound and hot.<br> C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission<br> to return to base. Rearm. Over.<br> Roger that. Second team inbound.<br> Your station.<br> On your location, four minutes.<br> All right, they're here.<br> Get the wounded ready to move.<br> Lay down some cover fire!<br> I thought I heard a noise out here!<br> -Load up. We're getting out of here.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> and will be with you in about 5 minutes.<br> Prepare your men for exfil.<br> Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!<br> Five minutes! The convoy is going to be<br> here in five minutes!<br> I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!<br> My last one!<br> The convoy is here!<br> Sergeant Eversmann.<br> I heard you guys needed a lift!<br> Yes, sir!<br> Bring your wounded<br> and start loading them up!<br> Hey, I got you. I got you.<br> It's okay. I want to walk.<br> Yeah, I would too. Let's go!<br> Move!<br> We get the pilots' bodies out,<br> and then we go to the stadium.<br> We're running out of room around here.<br> Cram into every possible space.<br> Okay, 10th Mountain provides security<br> for armour, walks us out of the hot zone.<br> Sir, with respect,<br> my Rangers can provide rear security.<br> We'll walk you out of the hot zone,<br> then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.<br> Okay, let's get out of here.<br> Let's go.<br> -All right, you got him?<br> -Yeah, come on.<br> Come on!<br> These things are fucking bullet magnets.<br> Come on, let's go!<br> We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.<br> Careful.<br> Easy.

Bring him through.<br> -I got him.<br> -Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.<br> -Got you, sir!<br> -Move!<br> -Got you!<br> Move out! Move out! Let's go!<br> Fuck!<br> Fire in the hole!<br> -Let's go! Move!<br> -Let's go!<br> -Open the hatch! We got men back here!<br> -No room here! Go on the roof!<br> What's going on?<br> -The roof?<br> -I'm not getting on no fucking roof!<br> No, no, it's full.<br> We're running out. Keep moving.<br> Use the vehicles as cover.<br> Move it! Let's go!<br> All right, hold it up. Hold it up.<br> -Move!<br> -Go! Move!<br> Go!<br> Get down! Get down!<br> Get down, lady!<br> I'm out of ammo!<br> Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!<br> Don't you do it.<br> -What are you doing?<br> -Don't you damn do it.<br> Kurth, let's go!<br> Easy.<br> Ah, shit.<br> Bullet missed your jugular by<br> about three millimetres. Don't move.<br> Hurry up, hurry up.<br> Little short on coffee,<br> but I got you some tea.<br> How you doing, soldier?<br> Can't feel a thing.<br> Take his pulse.<br> Hey, Sarg'nt.<br> Captain.<br> Lorenzo. How you doing?<br> It went in and out, so the medic said<br> I should be okay in a couple of days.<br> That's great news.<br> Are we going after them?<br> You bet your ass we will.<br> We got to regroup.<br> Don't go out there without me.<br> Don't go back out there without me.<br> I can still do my job.<br> You get some rest now, okay?<br> You're going back in?<br> There are still men out there.<br> Goddamn.<br> When I go home...<br> ...and people ask me:<br> "Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?<br> "Why? You some kind of war junkie?"<br> I won't say a goddamn word.<br> Why?<br> They won't understand.<br> They won't understand why we do it.<br> They won't understand<br> it's about the men next to you.<br> And that's it.<br> That's all it is.<br> Don't even think about it, all right?<br> I'm better on my own.<br> We started a whole new week.<br> It's Monday.<br> I was talking to Blackburn the other day...<br> ...and he asked me, "What changed?<br> Why are we going home?"<br> And I said, "Nothing."<br> But that's not true, you know.<br> I think everything's changed.<br> I know I've changed.<br> A friend of mine asked me<br> before I got here...<br> It was when we were all shipping out.<br> He asked me:<br> "Why are you going to fight<br> somebody else's war?<br> "What, do y'all think you're heroes?"<br> I didn't know what to say at the time...<br> ...but if he asked me again, I'd say no.<br> I'd say there's no way in hell.<br> Nobody asks to be a hero.<br> It just sometimes turns out that way.<br> I'll talk to your ma and pa<br> when I get home, okay?<br> My love, you are strong<br> and you will do well in life.<br> I love you and my children deeply.<br> Today and tomorrow,<br> let each day grow and grow.<br> Keep smiling and never give up,<br> even when things get you down.<br> So, in closing, my love...<br> ...tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.<br> Tell them I love them.<br> Then hug them for me...<br> ...and give them both<br> a kiss good night for Daddy.<br>
