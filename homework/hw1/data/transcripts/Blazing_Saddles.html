I-I guess<br> we kind of got caught up.<br> Listen, dummy, the surveyors say they may<br> have run into some quicksand up ahead.<br> Better check it out.<br> Okay, I'll send down a team of<br> horses to check out the ground.<br> Horses?

Splendid.<br> And so the rail road has got<br> to go through Rock Ridge.<br> Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.<br> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.<br> Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.<br> - Be still, Taggart. Be still.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> My mind is aglow with whirling,<br> transient nodes of thought...<br> careening through a<br> cosmic vapour of invention.<br> Ditto!<br> Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz?<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> A plan. A plan. We need a plan.<br> What in the hell was that?<br> Morris!<br> We can't hear ourselves think!<br> Sorry, your Worship, but I've got<br> two men home sick with the flu...<br> and it's utter chaos down here.<br> I'll try to keep it<br> as quiet as possible.<br> But as you can see...<br> this one is a doozey.<br> Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings.<br> Well, do your best.<br> Well, let's see. Where were we?<br> - Rock Ridge.<br> - Rock Ridge.<br> Yes, when that rail road<br> goes through Rock Ridge...<br> that land will be worth<br> millions, and I want it!<br> I want that land so badly,<br> I can taste it.<br> There must be a way.<br> - Clumsy fool!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Wait a minute! There might<br> be a legal precedent.<br> Of course! Land-snatching!<br> Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."<br> Haley vs. United States.<br> Haley, seven. United States, nothing.<br> You see, it can be done.<br> It can be done.<br> Unfortunately, there is one thing that<br> stands between me and that property.<br> The rightful owners.<br> There must be some way of scaring<br> them off, driving them out.<br> Getting rid of every human being<br> alive in that...<br> It's down the hall and to the left.<br> - No. Sir, sir.<br> - What?<br> I've got it!<br> What? What? What?<br> I know how we can run<br> everybody out of Rock Ridge.<br> How?<br> We'll kill the first-born male<br> child in every household!<br> Too Jewish.<br> - Let's see.<br> - I got it, I got it!<br> We'll work up a Number Six on them!<br> Number Six? I'm afraid I'm not familiar<br> with that one.<br> That's where we go<br> riding into town...<br> and a-whapping and a-whooping<br> every living thing...<br> that moves within an inch<br> of its life!<br> Except the women folks, of course.<br> You spare the women?<br> No, we rape the shit out of them<br> at the Number Six dance later on!<br> That's marvellous! That's so creative!<br> Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!<br> Oh, that uppity nigger went'n hit me<br> on the head with a shovel.<br> I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if<br> you could find it in your heart...<br> to hang him up by his<br> neck until he was dead.<br> Got him locked up downstairs.<br> Consider it done, stout fellow.<br> Morris?<br> I've got a special.<br> When can you work him in?<br> I couldn't possibly fit him in<br> until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.<br> Monday. Splendid.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> And don't you worry.<br> Why, we'll make Rock Ridge<br> think it's a chicken...<br> that got caught in a tractor's nuts!<br> Splendid!<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right, Taggart. Just a man<br> and a horse being hung out there.<br> There was a peaceful town called Rock Ridge<br> Where people lived in harmony<br> They never had no kind of trouble<br> There was no hint of misery<br> The town saloon was always lively<br> But never nasty or obscene<br> Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson<br> He always kept things nice and clean!<br> And all at once the trouble started<br> A pack of murderers and thieves<br> Like swarms of locusts they descended<br> Their aim to make the townsfolk flee<br> Shit!<br> Well, that's the end of this suit!<br> Have you ever seen such cruelty?<br> Now is a time of great decision<br> Are we to stay or up and quit?<br> There's no avoiding this conclusion<br> Our town is turning into shit<br> Be seated.<br> Well, I don't have to tell you<br> good folks...<br> what has been happening<br> here in our beloved little town.<br> Sheriff murdered, crops burned...<br> stores looted, people stampeded...<br> and cattle raped!<br> Now the time has come to act.<br> And act fast!<br> I'm leaving.<br> You get back here, you old<br> pious, candy-ass sidewinder!<br> There ain't no way that nobody<br> is going to leave this town!<br> Hell, I was born here<br> and I was raised here...<br> and goddamn it,<br> I'm going to die here!<br> And no sidewinder,<br> bushwhacking, hornswoggling...<br> cracker croaker, is going<br> to ruin my biscuit-cutter!<br> Now who can argue with that?<br> I think we're all indebted<br> to Gabby Johnson...<br> for clearly stating<br> what needed to be said.<br> I'm particularly glad that<br> these lovely children...<br> were here today to hear that speech.<br> Not only was it authentic<br> frontier gibberish...<br> it expressed a courage<br> little seen in this day and age!<br> What are we made of?<br> Our fathers came across the prairie...<br> fought Indians, fought drought,<br> fought locusts, fought Dix!<br> Remember when Richard Dix came in here<br> and tried to take over this town?<br> Well, we didn't give up then...<br> and by gum, we're not<br> going to give up now!<br> Olson Johnson is right!<br> What kind of people are we, anyhow?<br> I say we stay and fight it out!<br> Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about<br> Olson Johnson's being right.<br> And I'm not giving up<br> my ice cream parlour...<br> that I built with these two hands<br> for nothing or nobody!<br> Howard Johnson is right!<br> Thank you, Van.<br> Well, if we're going to stay, and<br> I think it's a big mistake...<br> we're going to need us a new sheriff.<br> Now, who is it going to be?<br> Why don't we wire the governor<br> to send us a sheriff?<br> Why should we get our own men killed?<br> Howard Johnson is right.<br> We'll wire the governor.<br> Then let us pray for the deliverance<br> of our new sheriff.<br> Will the congregation please rise?<br> I shall now read from the books<br> of Matthew, Mark, Luke...<br> and duck!<br> We've got to do something at once!<br> Governor? Governor.<br> - Governor, may I disturb you for a moment, sir?<br> - Yeah, what is it?<br> If you will just sign this, governor.<br> Right here.<br> Yes, yes, what the hell is it?<br> Well, under the provisions<br> of this bill...<br> we would snatch 200,000 acres<br> of Indian territory...<br> which we have deemed unsafe<br> for their use at this time.<br> They're such children.<br> What will it cost, man?<br> What will it cost?<br> A box of these.<br> Are you crazy? They'll never go<br> for it, and then again they might.<br> The little red devils, they<br> love toys. May I try one?<br> - Please do, sir.<br> - Thank you, thank you.<br> These things are defective.<br> Right as usual, sir.<br> Show-off!<br> Just sign this, sir. Right here.<br> - Okay, give us a hand here.<br> - All right, sir.<br> Work, work, work, work, work,<br> work, work, work, work.<br> Hello, boys, have a good night's rest?<br> I missed you.<br> Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.<br> What the hell is this?<br> This is the bill that will convert<br> the State Hospital for the Insane...<br> into the William J. Le Petomane<br> Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.<br> Gentlemen, this...<br> this bill will be<br> a giant step forward...<br> in the treatment<br> of the insane gambler.<br> Yes, bravo! Beautiful.<br> Thank you. Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.<br> It's not Hedy. It's Hedley.<br> Hedley Lamarr.<br> What the hell are you worried about?<br> This is 1874.<br> You'll be able to sue her.<br> - Just sign right here, sir.<br> - All right, thank you.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> All right, help me in with this.<br> Help me in with this.<br> Help me in with this.<br> Just, ah, think of your secretary.<br> Ah, that was a very good suggestion.<br> - Thank you.<br> - All right.<br> Okay, is that it? Anything else?<br> Just this urgent telegram<br> from Rock Ridge.<br> It arrived last Friday.<br> Last Friday?<br> Read it, read it.<br> Wild bitch.<br> "Sheriff murdered. Church meeting<br> bombed. Reign of terror must cease.<br> "Send new sheriff immediately."<br> Holy underwear!<br> Sheriff murdered! Innocent women<br> and children blown to bits!<br> We've got to protect our<br> phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.<br> We must do something about this<br> immediately, immediately, immediately!<br> I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!<br> Give the governor a "hrumph".<br> You watch your ass.<br> Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.<br> - Well put.<br> - Thank you very much, sir.<br> As Attorney General, I can assure you...<br> that a suitable sheriff will be found<br> to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.<br> Meeting is adjourned.<br> Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean<br> to overstep my bounds. You say that.<br> What?<br> - Meeting is adjourned.<br> - It is?<br> No. You say that, governor.<br> - What?<br> - Meeting is adjourned.<br> It is?<br> - Here, play around with this for a while.<br> - Oh, thank you, Hedy.<br> - No, it's Hedley.<br> - It is?<br> Why don't you give these out<br> to some of the boys...<br> in lieu of pay? Here you go.<br> Franky. Johnny. Patsy. Jelly.<br> And one for Miss Stein,<br> my beloved secretary.<br> Play with these, boys,<br> in lieu of the other things.<br> This friggin' thing is warped.<br> Why do I always get a warped one?<br> A sheriff! But law and order<br> is the last thing I want.<br> Wait a minute. Maybe I could<br> turn this thing to my advantage.<br> If I could find a sheriff who so<br> offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...<br> that his very appearance<br> would drive them out of town...<br> But where would I find such a man?<br> Why am I asking you?<br> Welcome to Hanging House.<br> Not to worry...<br> everyone is equal in my eye.<br> Oh, not my ear! Not my ear.<br> - Not in the ear. Not in the ear.<br> - Sir?<br> Governor!<br> Yes?<br> Official business, sir.<br> Is it important?<br> It's very crucial.<br> Be with you in a minute.<br> Throw something on<br> and stay in that position.<br> Oh, sorry gentlemen.<br> Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking<br> the parapet, taking a look around.<br> What can I do for you?<br> Governor, as per your instructions...<br> I'd like you to meet<br> the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.<br> I'd be delighted... Wow!<br> I've got to talk to you. Come here.<br> Have you gone berserk?<br> Can't you see that man is a ni...<br> Wrong person.

Now it's "please".<br> This morning I couldn't get the time<br> of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?<br> Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who".<br> He's more of a "what".<br> What he said.<br> - Well, I don't know...<br> - Oh, thank you, sir.<br> Oh, thank you very much!<br> The fool's going to...<br> I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.<br> No, no, don't do that!
