Get in.<br> - Hello, Danny.<br> - Colonel.<br> You look well.<br> Clean living and a pure heart,<br> I suppose, huh?<br> Walk with me.<br> It seems the rebels have taken back<br> the diamond fields, Danny.<br> The government<br> of Sierra Leone has contracted us...<br> ...to go in there<br> and take the rebels down.<br> So you sell the rebels weapons...<br> ...the government hires you<br> when they use them? Nice, sir.<br> I assume you're asking<br> for mining concessions, huh?<br> We save the government,<br> they show their gratitude.<br> And you get rich, right?<br> How long have I known you, Danny?<br> I was... I was 19, sir.<br> And you survived.<br> A lot of boys didn't. Why is that?<br> Just lucky, I guess.<br> No, you were a good soldier.<br> But I made you better, didn't I?<br> Yes, sir. Yes, you did.<br> And over the years,<br> didn't I protect you...<br> ...teach you about diamonds,<br> cut you in on the deals?<br> - Some might call it that, yeah.<br> - But not you...<br> ...because you done with me now, eh?<br> On to bigger things.<br> I need a man that knows<br> his way around up there.<br> Unless, of course,<br> you wanna cut me in. Something pink?<br> Sir...<br> Our deal went bad,<br> and you owe me money.<br> I'll take a stone as payment.<br> Look, do you think if I found a stone<br> like that, I'd still be on this continent?<br> - Come on.<br> - Danny, give me your hand.<br> That's red earth. It's in our skin.<br> The Shona say the color<br> comes from all the blood...<br> ...that's being spilled<br> fighting over the land.<br> This is home.<br> You'll never leave Africa.<br> If you say so, sir.<br> So, what did you do, bury it?<br> Yeah. Yeah, I would have<br> buried it, huh?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - What am I talking about? Come on, bru.<br> I'm late for work.<br> Pink, huh? The biggest one<br> he'd ever seen.<br> You were in the mining camps,<br> weren't you, bru?<br> Why else would that rebel with<br> the bandaged arm make up such a story?<br> Go ask him.<br> Thank you.<br> Your mothers and fathers,<br> your brothers and sisters are dead.<br> - You are dead! You have been reborn.<br> - No!<br> - We are your family now.<br> - No! No!<br> Your parents are weak.<br> They're the farmers.<br> They're the fishermen.<br> They've done nothing<br> but suck the blood from this country.<br> But you are the heroes<br> who will save this nation.<br> You are not children anymore.<br> You're men.<br> No one has ever given you respect...<br> ...but with this in your hand,<br> they go fear you.<br> If you do not get<br> the respect you deserve...<br> ...you will take it<br> by shedding their blood.<br> - Repeat after me, shed their blood.<br> - Shed their blood.<br> - Louder! Shed their blood! Shed their blood!<br> - Shed their blood!<br> Make them hear you in Freetown.<br> Shed their blood! Shed their blood!<br> Shed their blood! Shed their blood!<br> Shed their blood!<br> - Dia Vandy, stand up.<br> - Shed their blood! Shed their blood!<br> - Shed their blood! Shed their blood!<br> - Put your hand on the gun.<br> Shed their blood!<br> Shed their blood!<br> Shed their blood!<br> Shed their blood!<br> - Shed their blood! Shed their blood!<br> - Now squeeze the trigger.<br> Come on, Dia. Pull the trigger.<br> Pull the trigger!<br> I know, I know.<br> It's hard to be a man.<br> Sit up. Come.<br> But you are a soldier<br> of the revolution now.<br> And I am your commander.<br> Whatever you need...<br> ...guns, CDs, food...<br> ...come to me.<br> I will take care of you.<br> Today, you are promoted<br> to the rank of captain.<br> Dia Vandy...<br> ...boss man.<br> How's it, bru?<br> - You got something for me, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - So, what's new, M'Ed?<br> - Fucking RUF.<br> Tried to hit the government building<br> across the street.<br> Shit, man, half the people<br> be soldiers today, RUF tomorrow.<br> - Might be time to get your family out, huh?<br> - And go where?<br> Just fire up the chopper<br> and fly away like you people?<br> This my country, man.<br> We here long before you came,<br> long after you gone.<br> - Hi. I'm Maddy Bowen.<br> - How about you dance with me?<br> - No, I don't dance.<br> - Neither do I. Come on.<br> - So, Danny...<br> - Archer.<br> Archer.<br> When did you first start<br> moving stones? Was it Angola?<br> Then you did the whole<br> mercenary thing. Was that fun?<br> So, what are you?<br> Nihilist? Opportunist?<br> Maybe I wasn't breast-fed<br> as a child, huh?<br> You think I haven't met<br> people like you before?<br> - I think you get off on people like me.<br> - You think?<br> When did you first start<br> working for Van De Kaap?<br> Christ, you never stop, do you?<br> No, I never stop.<br> Do you want me to stop?<br> Why don't we go back to your place,<br> see what's in the minibar, huh?<br> I'm a print journalist. I drank it.<br> Is it possible that you don't care<br> how many people die...<br> ...because of the deals you do?<br> People here kill each other as a way of life.<br> Always been like that.<br> So you can just watch it<br> and go about your day?<br> Maybe we should all just<br> write about it, then.<br> Look, thanks for the dance, huh?<br> - And a shot too, huh, M'Ed?<br> - Sure.<br> You're a hard case, huh?<br> Tell me something,<br> how long you been here in Africa, huh?<br> Three months. And before that,<br> Afghanistan and Bosnia.<br> You come here<br> with your laptop computer...<br> ...and your malaria medicine<br> and your little bottles of hand sanitizer.<br> Think you're gonna change<br> the outcome, huh?<br> Let me tell you something.<br> You sell blood diamonds too.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> Tell me, how is that?<br> Who do you think buys<br> the stones that I bring out?<br> Dreamy American girls who all want<br> a storybook wedding and a big, shiny rock...<br> ...like the ones in the advertisements<br> of your politically-correct magazines.<br> So, please, don't come here<br> and make judgments on me, all right?<br> I provide a service. The world wants what<br> we have, and they want it cheap.<br> We're in business together.<br> Get over yourself, darling.<br> Okay, just to clarify, not all American girls<br> want a storybook wedding...<br> ...just like not all Africans kill each other<br> as a way of life.<br> And yeah, it's a shit, shit world,<br> but you know what?<br> Good things are done every day,<br> just, apparently, not by you.<br> This place is about to explode.<br> I wanna spend my time<br> with someone else.<br> You are listening to BBC World Service.<br> In Sierra Leone, Revolutionary United Front<br> forces have been sighted...<br> ...within 10 kilometers<br> of the capital city of Freetown.<br> The minister of the interior<br> has expressed confidence...<br> ...that the government troops<br> can repel the attack.<br> All foreign nationals are being advised<br> to leave the country.<br> There are also unconfirmed reports...<br> ...that atrocities are being committed by<br> both sides in the rapidly worsening situation.<br> The United Nations has described<br> the refugee situation as critical.<br> Don't tell me you're gonna try<br> and sell it yourself.<br> To who?<br> And for what price, my friend?<br> You need my help,<br> whether you like it or not.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Here, let me help you with that.<br> You hear that? You hear that?<br> They came into the city overnight.<br> It's started.<br> What are you gonna do now, huh?<br> Listen, the right stone can buy anything.<br> Information, safety, even freedom.<br> But a big stone does not stay secret<br> for very long.<br> The moment you tell anyone about it,<br> your life is absolutely worthless.<br> The only reason you're alive is<br> you haven't told anyone where it is.<br> Am I right? Am I?<br> Who do you think got you<br> out of jail, huh?<br> - That makes us partners.<br> - I am not your partner!<br> What if I helped you find your family?<br> What do you know of my family?<br> The relief agencies are useless,<br> the hospitals are overwhelmed.<br> - There are other ways, bru.<br> - Liar.<br> Look at me. I know people, huh?<br> White people.<br> Without me, you're just another<br> black man in Africa, all right?<br> Oh, shit.<br> We got no time.<br> What's it gonna be?<br> You would say anything.<br> How can I trust you?<br> I don't give a fuck about you, all right?<br> That diamond could be priceless!<br> We split it, and you get your family.<br> What's it gonna be, yes or no? Yes or no?<br> - Where will we go? Where do we go?<br> - Come on, follow me!<br> Stay low!<br> Get your ass over here!<br> Wait!<br> Now!<br> Come on, come on.<br> Come on!<br> Come on.<br> Fuck!<br> No, this way.<br> Fire!<br> Fuck! Go, go, go!<br> Go!<br> Shit!<br> No! No!<br> This way.<br> This way. Stay low.<br> Come on. Go, go, go. Come on.<br> Come on!<br> It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.<br> Fire!<br> - Is there another way?<br> - That bridge is the only way across, huh?<br> So, what do we do?<br> - You are RUF, huh? And I am your prisoner.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You wanna see your son again, don't you?<br> You stay behind me.<br> Wait, wait. Wait.<br> Bring that pink chicken skin<br> over here, huh?<br> Now let me shoot that pink ass, boy.<br> Where are we going?<br> Lungi's under government control.<br> I'm gonna try to locate a sat phone<br> to get in contact with my pilot, all right?<br> I have agreed to nothing.<br> You're in a bit of a conundrum there,<br> my friend.<br> You know what that means?<br> It means you have no choice.<br> So you're a fisherman, huh?<br> - What do you catch mostly?<br> - Fish.<br> Come on.<br> - Hello.<br> - Back away from the fence.<br> Listen, I'm from<br> the Cape Herald, all right?<br> My wallet, my credentials,<br> everything got left in Freetown.<br> We barely got out with our lives.<br> Can we just get through?<br> Back away from the fence.<br> But you are not a journalist.<br> I'm trying to get us to Kono.<br> - Do you understand that, huh?<br> - Getting B-roll. Wait.<br> Listen, I'm coming back.<br> I'm coming back just now.<br> How's it, my bru?<br> Have you got an extra smoke?<br> - Here.<br> - Oh, cheers.<br> I'm looking for someone, an American<br> by the name of Maddy Bowen.<br> - If you saw her, you would not forget it.<br> - Yeah, I know her.<br> - Is it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Can you tell her Danny Archer's looking<br> for her? I've got the story she wants.<br> Okay, but I'm going out for a bit.<br> If I see her before, I'll tell her.<br> Magic. Listen, we'll be<br> right down the road, huh?<br> - Sweet. Cheers, bru.<br> - Cheers.<br> It is as I said.<br> You will say anything.<br> - You don't mind waiting?<br> - No worries.<br> - Thank you so much. I'll just be a sec.<br> - All right, Maddy.<br> Hi.<br> You got out.<br> Yes. Hello again.<br> - This is Solomon Vandy.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> So I'm on deadline. I've been waiting<br> four hours to use the phone.<br> - I've got someone holding my place in line.<br> - I understand. Come with me, huh?<br> All right. Here it is.<br> - There's a company called Tiara Diamonds.<br> - Right?<br> They get the stones<br> that I smuggle into Liberia.<br> Now, Van De Kaap<br> has no visible ties to Tiara...<br> ...but through a series of cross holdings<br> and offshore bank accounts...<br> - ...they actually own it.<br> - You can prove this?<br> - If you help me out, yeah.<br> - Right, here it comes.<br> Before you say anything,<br> look at that man. You see him?<br> His entire village was burned down.<br> His wife and children, they got away.<br> He's been working in the mining camps,<br> trying to get his family back.<br> He cannot get through the red tape.<br> All I'm asking is this,<br> that you help him, huh?<br> And how do you know this man?<br> - I know him. I know him.<br> - Oh, come on, Archer.<br> You're using him.<br> I'm using him, and you are using me,<br> and this is how it works, isn't it?<br> Come on. Look, you've got access<br> to U.N. databases.<br> - You can track his family for him.<br> - Why?<br> This whole country's at war.<br> Why should I help just one person?<br> I can't believe I just said that.<br> My family's here, in Guinea?<br> Yes, according to the manifest.<br> I do not know how to thank you.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> This is what a million people looks like.<br> At the moment, the second largest<br> refugee camp in Africa.<br> Might catch a minute of this on CNN,<br> somewhere between Sports and Weather.<br> - Hello.<br> - Yeah, hello?<br> I've spoken with Colonel Coedoo...<br> ...and highlighted the names<br> we're looking for.<br> - Move away.<br> - What him doing?<br> Okay, I'm gonna check for you.<br> - Wait me there.<br> - Okay, thank you.<br> We are here to help you.<br> This woman says she has<br> spoken to Coedoo.<br> An entire country made homeless.<br> Two multiplied by three<br> is equal to six.<br> Two multiplied by four<br> is equal to eight.<br> Two multiplied by five<br> is equal to 10.<br> Two multiplied by six<br> is equal to 12.<br> Jassie.<br> Jassie!<br> Jassie!<br> - Jassie.<br> - Solo.<br> - Jassie.<br> - Solo.<br> Jassie. Jassie.<br> - Solomon.<br> - Jassie.<br> - Solomon.<br> - Jassie.<br> Dia. Dia.<br> Where is Dia?<br> Jassie!<br> They took him.<br> There are only two children<br> on the manifest.<br> - Where is my son?<br> - Oh, Christ.<br> Where is my son?<br> - Away from the fence.<br> - Where is my son?<br> Move away from the fence.<br> - Let them out! Let them out!<br> - Keep away from the fence.<br> Let them out!<br> Away from the fence.<br> - They'll shoot you!<br> - Jassie!<br> No! Solo!<br> Do you want your wife and child<br> to watch you die?<br> Solo! Solo!<br> They said they're concerned that<br> some of the refugees might be rebels...<br> ...so they refused to release them<br> until there's a cease-fire.<br> I'm so sorry, Solomon.<br> What you want, Mr. Archer,<br> is beyond those hills...<br> ...where I buried it.<br> You say the mine is on the Sewa River.<br> Where exactly?<br> Solomon.<br> I do not need a map.<br> Yeah, well, I do.<br> Look, we are down here, huh?<br> The press convoy<br> is on its way to Kono.<br> You say the diamond mine is up here.<br> Where did you bury it?<br> When we get to Kono,<br> we're gonna have to walk, all right?<br> You damn well better be able to find it.<br> My son is a very good student.<br> He walks five kilometers<br> to the Sister School...<br> ...every morning to study English.<br> He's going to be a doctor one day.<br> "In the 90-degree heat,<br> Solomon Vandy drops to his knees...<br> ...rattling the wire<br> with his powerful hands."<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> Do you think I'm exploiting his grief?<br> You're right. It's shit.<br> It's like one of those infomercials.<br> You know, the little black babies<br> with swollen bellies and flies in their eyes.<br> So here I've got dead mothers,<br> I've got severed limbs, but it's nothing new.<br> It might be enough<br> to make people cry if they read it...<br> ...maybe even write a check...<br> ...but it's not gonna be enough<br> to make it stop.<br> I am sick of writing about victims,<br> but it's all I can fucking do.<br> Because I need facts.<br> I need names. I need dates.<br> I need pictures. I need bank accounts.<br> People back home<br> wouldn't buy a ring...<br> ...if they knew it cost<br> someone else their hand.<br> But I can't write that story...<br> ...until I get facts<br> that can be verified...<br> ...which is to say, until I find someone<br> who will go on record.<br> So if that is not you...<br> ...and you're not really gonna help me,<br> and we're not really gonna screw...<br> ...then why don't you get the fuck<br> out of my face...<br> ...and let me do my work?<br> Do you know that Solomon thinks<br> his son's gonna be a doctor one day?<br> Maybe his baby dies in that camp.<br> Maybe his daughter gets raped.<br> Who knows, maybe both.<br> Do you realize that<br> that diamond...<br> ...is the only chance he has<br> of getting his family out?<br> - You don't give a rat's ass about his family.<br> - Do you understand that?<br> Listen, I need to get to Kono, all right?<br> The only way<br> is with the press convoy.<br> I'm a journalist,<br> and he's my cameraman, all right?<br> - No.<br> - Please, Maddy.<br> - Please.<br> - No!<br> After I smuggle the stones<br> across the border...<br> ...local buyers get them<br> to a middleman in Monrovia.<br> Go on.<br> He pays off Customs and then certifies<br> that the diamonds were mined in Liberia.<br> That way, they can be legally exported.<br> Now, once they've reached<br> the buyers in Antwerp...<br> ...diamonds are brought<br> to the sorting tables...<br> ...no more questions are asked.<br> By the time they get to India...<br> ...the dirty stones are mixed with<br> the clean stones from all over the world...<br> ...and then they become<br> like any other diamonds.<br> And Van De Kaap<br> knows about all this?<br> Yeah.<br> When I get to London,<br> I meet with Simmons.<br> Supply and demand. You control the supply,<br> and you keep the demand high.<br> - Agreed.<br> - Good.<br> Now, there's an underground vault...<br> ...where they put all the stones<br> they buy up to keep off the market...<br> ...so they can keep the price high.<br> If rebels wanna flood the market<br> with a billion dollars' worth of rough...<br> ...a company like Van De Kaap,<br> who says that they're rare...<br> ...can't afford to let that happen.<br> Especially when they're telling<br> some poor sod...<br> ...he's supposed to shell out<br> three months' salary...<br> ...for an engagement ring.<br> Now, technically speaking,<br> they're not financing the war...<br> ...but creating a situation<br> where it pays to keep it going.<br> - You understand?<br> - Yes. And where's my proof?<br> Names, dates and numbered accounts.<br> You publish one word of this story<br> before I give them the stone...<br> ...and I'm dead, huh?<br> After I give it to them,<br> then... I leave this continent forever.<br> If you don't come out<br> with the diamond?<br> Then write whatever you want.<br> I'm already dead.<br> Now, remember. All you say is,<br> "I am the cameraman," all right?<br> Listen, I cannot do this.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because I am not a journalist.<br> - Of course you're not.<br> - Well, then how can I say I am?<br> Because you do. Because that's how<br> you get your son back, all right?<br> Now get on the bus. Go.<br> I am the cameraman.<br> You are writing about<br> what is happening here?<br> Yes.<br> So when people in your country read it,<br> they will come help us, yes?<br> Probably not.<br> - You heard of a Stinger?<br> - What?<br> Your friend, Maddy. She's like a full-on,<br> heat-seeking missile, bru.<br> I mean, I saw her go into Afghanistan...<br> ...like about 200 clicks<br> into Taliban land.<br> When the military said no,<br> she just took a bus, bru.<br> Came back with 3000 words,<br> and she still looked so good.<br> - Like hot, you know?<br> - All right.<br> Calm down to the frantic now, huh?<br> - What's that?<br> - What's going on?<br> Looks like it was an RPG.<br> Open the door. Let us out.<br> - Let's go, let's go.<br> - Come on. Go, go, go.<br> Go, go! Move, move, move!<br> We've just happened upon<br> the sight of an ambush...<br> ...fifteen kilometers<br> from the Liberian border...<br> - ...near the Moa River...<br> - As you can see behind me...<br> ...just a few minutes ago...<br> - ...an ambulance has...<br> - Got movement in the bush.<br> - Check out the head of the road.<br> - Spread out.<br> --at this site.<br> Dozens of--<br> Many are injured.<br> Get back on the bus, huh?<br> Get back on! Come on!<br> - Maddy!<br> - Move it! Move it!<br> Get back on the bus!<br> Solomon! Solomon!<br> - Let's go.<br> - Solomon, come here!<br> - Go, go, go.<br> - Come on, come on.<br> - Get in the bus!<br> - Move, move, move! Come on, come on.<br> - Move!<br> - Get in the bus. Let's go.<br> Get in, get in.<br> Goddamn it, get in! Get in!<br> - Let me inside!<br> - There's no fucking space!<br> - Let them on the bus.<br> - You give him your seat.<br> What if we just take your place, huh?<br> What if we take your place?<br> That's enough. He can ride with me.<br> Oi, he can ride with me.<br> Maddy! Let's go!<br> Maddy, let's go. Come on!<br> Nothing like a little bang-bang<br> to get the heart started, Maddy.<br> - Whatever you say, Corbauld.<br> - Come on, love. Don't be like that.<br> Story's played out, hasn't it?<br> Government bad, rebels worse.<br> No one gives a toss anymore.<br> Know what I mean?<br> This medicine will make you strong...<br> ...make you invisible to your enemies.<br> Bullets will bounce off you.<br> Superboy Killer, yes, huh?<br> Commando.<br> Foreigners are the cause of the problems.<br> Poppy Sankoh say,<br> "Overthrow those who would exploit you."<br> I am Baby Killer.<br> - I am the Master of Disaster.<br> - You will be strong.<br> I am Born Trouble.<br> I am See Me No More.<br> You'd think they'd want<br> at least one decent road in this place.<br> I'm gonna have to start charging<br> an entrance fee. Oh, God!<br> Get down!<br> - Look out!<br> - Shit!<br> - You all right?<br> - Fine.<br> Shit!<br> Hold on!<br> Hold on!<br> Come on.<br> - Everyone all right, huh?<br> - Yeah, I'm fine.<br> Let me see that. You okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right.<br> Quietly, now. Quietly.<br> Come on.<br> Kamajors. Local militia<br> protecting their homes, huh?<br> - Do not look them in the eye.<br> - No.<br> Excuse me. Excuse me?<br> Hi, I'm Maddy Bowen<br> with Vital Affairs magazine.<br> Wonder if I could take your picture.<br> I'm just gonna get my camera.<br> I've heard about your struggle.<br> I'd love to know more about it.<br> Would you mind if I took your picture?<br> Everyone together?<br> Everyone could all come in together.<br> Is that okay?<br> If everyone could come closer.<br> If you come over here and come in<br> nice and close. That's good.<br> Yeah. That's great.<br> And we'll get one with all of us.<br> There you go. That's perfect.<br> How about one together?<br> Us together, what do you think?<br> I'll come in like this, yeah?<br> Cheese.<br> So do you think<br> they've read your work?<br> Shut up.<br> Hey, get them, get them, get them.<br> - I got a score. I got a score.<br> - You missed.<br> Where have you come from?<br> - Where did you come from?<br> - Where have you come from?<br> That's right. Yeah.<br> From New York. From America.<br> I don't have anything for you.<br> My name is Benjamin Margai.<br> Danny Archer. This is Maddy Bowen.<br> - Hello. How are you?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> I'm the cameraman?<br> The Belgians were the first<br> to chop off limbs in Africa.<br> King Leopold took one hand<br> for every hundredth slave in the Congo...<br> ...to keep them in line.<br> Many of these children<br> were taken by the RUF.<br> We have taken them back.<br> Some of them have been<br> made to do horrible things.<br> We are trying<br> to bring them back to life.<br> Let me show you.<br> Imagine doing all this, huh?<br> What's your excuse?<br> Well, it's gotten hard to go back<br> to sipping lattes and talking interest rates.<br> So you're an action junkie, huh?<br> Three out of five ex-boyfriends<br> recently polled...<br> ...say that I prefer to be<br> in a constant state of crisis.<br> Maybe I just give a shit.<br> You were good today.<br> You know that?<br> You too.<br> "--that sometimes they forgot<br> to close the door.<br> She also wrote<br> about her sister Josie...<br> ...who was very ill<br> and who had to be taken to hospital."<br> Cheers.<br> So how many attacks<br> have there been in the area?<br> I have known most of the rebels<br> since they were children.<br> The local commander is still afraid<br> I will come after him with my ruler.<br> So you think because your intentions<br> are good, they'll spare you, huh?<br> My heart always told me<br> that people are inherently good.<br> My experience suggests otherwise.<br> But what about you, Mr. Archer?<br> In your long career as a journalist...<br> ...would you say that people<br> are mostly good?<br> No.<br> I'd say they're just people.<br> Exactly. It is what they do<br> that makes them good or bad.<br> A moment of love,<br> even in a bad man...<br> ...can give meaning to a life.<br> None of us knows which path<br> will lead us to God.<br> Hey!<br> It's palm wine.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> - Yeah, yeah. It takes getting used to, huh?<br> God.<br> - Drank that as a boy.<br> - In Rhodesia?<br> I take notes.<br> The Shona...<br> The Shona have a word for me.<br> - It means "white boy in Africa."<br> - When did you leave?<br> I didn't leave.<br> I got sent away to South Africa<br> in 1978 when the munts overran us.<br> Then you joined the army?<br> Yeah. Yeah, I did my time in Angola.<br> - The 32 Battalion.<br> - That's right.<br> You know, contrary to what<br> you might think about us...<br> ...we fought with the blacks, huh?<br> Yeah. Side by side.<br> There was no apartheid in a foxhole.<br> The colonel always used to tell us that.<br> - This is Colonel Coetzee?<br> - Yeah.<br> Then, of course, it's 1994.<br> No more army.<br> No more apartheid.<br> Truth and reconciliation<br> and all of that rubbish, you know.<br> Kumbaya.<br> We fought and died together,<br> you know?<br> Black and white. Most people back home<br> didn't even know we were at war.<br> We thought we were<br> fighting Communism...<br> ...but in the end, it was all about<br> who gets what, you know?<br> Ivory, oil, gold:<br> Diamonds.<br> So one day I decided,<br> "Fuck it," you know?<br> "I'm gonna get mine."<br> You gonna steal his diamond?<br> That diamond is my ticket<br> out of this godforsaken continent.<br> That doesn't answer the question.<br> My dad came home<br> from the war in '69.<br> And it took him...<br> ...about 20 years to get right.<br> What?<br> You Americans love to talk<br> about your feelings, huh?<br> So, what does that mean?<br> What does that mean?<br> - Got a thing for messed-up vets now?<br> - Shut up.<br> You lost both your parents.<br> That's a polite way<br> of putting it, yeah.<br> Mom was raped and shot...<br> ...and Dad was decapitated<br> and hung from a hook in the barn.<br> I was 9.<br> Boohoo, right?<br> Sometimes I wonder...<br> ...will God ever forgive us<br> for what we've done to each other?<br> Then I look around and I realize...<br> ...God left this place a long time ago.<br> It's...<br> What's the point, huh?<br> Oh, shit. Keep moving, huh?<br> - What?<br> - Drive at them. They'll panic.<br> Do you know where the word<br> "infantry" comes from?<br> It means "child soldier."<br> They are just children.<br> - Stop! Stop! RUF on the road!<br> - Hi. Hello. Hello.<br> Hello, little brothers.<br> - RUF on the road!<br> - Yeah, yeah. What is your names?<br> I'm Dead Body.<br> Who is this motherfucker?<br> We are teachers on our way to Kono.<br> Only RUF on the road.<br> - RUF only!<br> - Yes, yes, I understand that.<br> - Only RUF!<br> - But son, this is--<br> Don't move!

Because I can<br> get someone there to help you.<br> Maddy, you find someplace safe<br> for the boy, all right?<br> And keep him out of sight.<br> And get Solomon to London.<br> He's bringing something with him.<br> But he's gonna need your help.<br> Why aren't you bringing it yourself?<br> I'm saying it's a real story now.<br> And you can write the hell out of it.<br> I'm really happy I met you.<br> You know that?<br> Yeah, I'm...<br> I'm really happy I met you too.<br> And I wish I could be there with you.<br> That's all right.<br> I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.<br> When we get to the stairs,<br> you just keep walking...<br> ...and I'll wait for you here.<br> You're not coming.<br> I'm not here. Good luck.<br> You must understand, Mr. Vandy...<br> ...that your diamond could have ended up<br> nowhere else but with us.<br> - It is not enough.<br> - I assure you, 2 million pounds...<br> ...is more than anyone else will offer you<br> for that stone under the circumstances.<br> I want what was promised to me<br> by Mr. Archer.<br> - What was promised to you?<br> - My family.<br> When they are here,<br> you will get the stone.<br> I will have the money too.<br> Well, may I see what I'm buying?<br> You will get the stone<br> once my family is here.<br> How do I even know you've got it?<br> Can you comment on the diamonds<br> mined in Sierra Leone?<br> I'm not going to comment<br> on some sensationalist magazine article.<br> - What about Liberia?<br> - No comment. No comment.<br> - Mr. Van De Kaap--<br> - That's all I have to say.<br> The natural resources<br> of a country...<br> ...are the property of its people.<br> They are not ours to steal...<br> ...or exploit in the name of our comfort,<br> our corporations, or our consumerism.<br> They're ready for you, sir.<br> The Third World is not a world apart.<br> And the witness you will hear today<br> speaks on its behalf.<br> Let us hear the voice of that world.<br> Let us learn from that voice.<br> And let us ignore it no more.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> Mr. Solomon Vandy.<br>
