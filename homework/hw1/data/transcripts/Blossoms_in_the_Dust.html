                        Oh, that really looks<br> very nice, Frederick.<br> - Thank you, ma'am.<br> - Yes. Very, very nice indeed.<br> - Have the musicians come yet?<br> - They're washing in the cook's room.<br> Well, tell them when<br> Miss Charlotte and Miss Edna come down...<br> ...to play a fanfare.<br> A fanfare, ma'am?<br> Oh, you mean like they do<br> in the circus.<br> Very good, ma'am. I'll tell them.<br> Serve the punch at 10:00.<br> Oh, Frederick, be careful. Very little rum.<br> It's a young people's party, you know.<br> Very good, ma'am.<br> George, you're not even dressed.<br> Well, well, well.<br> How pretty you look, my dear Catherine.<br> - Thank you, dear. But, really...<br> - Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I'll hurry.<br> But I've just been thinking how sad it is<br> losing our two girls.<br> And both at once.<br> Oh, we're not really losing them, dear.<br> You know, a son is a son<br> till he gets him a wife.<br> But a daughter's a daughter<br> all the rest of her life.<br> Well, I won't be a minute, dear.<br> - Gus, is Miss Edna home?<br> - Yes?<br> Not yet, ma'am.<br> She took the tandem out about 4:00.<br> Dear, oh, dear, she'll be late.<br> Oh, madam, here's Miss Edna now.<br> Whoa.<br> - Here, Tom.<br> Edna.<br> Thank goodness you've come.<br> I know, I know, I know, Mother.<br> But I couldn't help it.<br> I had to go to the bank<br> and get the favors.<br> I'll dress as fast as I can.<br> Oh, here they are.<br> Paper caps, snappers, balloons, confetti.<br> You look simply lovely, Mother.<br> Thank you, dear.<br> - Oh, how beautiful.<br> Charlotte. Charlotte.<br> - Charlotte.<br> - Edna.<br> Where have you been?<br> Charlotte.<br> Tell me, do I look like a hussy?<br> Edna, what on earth do you mean?<br> Do I? Do I look like the kind of girl<br> that men insult?<br> Because I've been insulted.<br> Why, Edna Kahly.<br> I went to the bank to cash the check...<br> Father's check.<br> - for the favors and things,<br> and the cashier, my dear...<br> ...the cashier at that bank.<br> What on earth did he do?<br> Well, he looked at me and smiled.<br> And then I took my gloves off,<br> like this...<br> ...and then he saw my ring...<br> Damon's ring.<br> And what do you think he had<br> the effrontery to say to me?<br> He said, "If that's<br> an engagement ring, young lady...<br> ...you'd better get rid of it right quick. "<br> Right quick.<br> Must be a Westerner.<br> I never was so outraged in my life.<br> What on earth did you say?<br> Well, I don't know<br> what possessed me, but I said:<br> "Why?" And he said...<br> Well, what did he say, darling?<br> He said,<br> "Because you're gonna marry me. "<br> He didn't.<br> How perfectly thrilling.<br> Thrilling?<br> I never was so furious in my life.<br> It's a good thing Damon wasn't there.<br> He'd have knocked him down...<br> ...there'd have been a scene.<br> - What'd you do? Did you slap him?<br> No. I just picked up the money<br> and walked straight out of the bank.<br> If you knew how humiliated I was,<br> and how cheap I felt.<br> I'm going to tell Father.<br> I'm going to see that that impudent<br> cashier's discharged tomorrow.<br> Was he good-looking?<br> Oh, he wasn't anywhere near<br> as handsome as Damon.<br> Here's the new bustle, Miss Charlotte.<br> Ain't it a daisy?<br> Oh, Edna, I wonder if you know<br> how grateful I am.<br> Grateful, Charlotte? Why?<br> For all your darling parents<br> have done for me.<br> Oh, dear, you mustn't feel...<br> I was such a baby<br> when I came here to live.<br> I don't even remember<br> my own mother and father.<br> But you've let me share yours<br> and I love you for it. I always will.<br> Oh, darling.<br> Why, think how happy you've made us.<br> I hope I have.<br> Listen. Carriages.<br> It's David and Allan.<br> Hurry, hurry. We'd better dress.<br> Good evening, sirs.<br> - Good evening, Gus.<br> - Good evening, Gus.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, Edna, I only hope Allan's mother<br> and father take me into their hearts too.<br> I love him so.<br> Why, of course you do, darling.<br> We're going to be so terribly happy<br> when we're married.<br> Well, we mustn't cry about it.<br> Oh, it's just leaving home and all our<br> good times together and this dear room.<br> Well, we'll only be across the street,<br> after all.<br> Why, we'll never be separated, really.<br> We'll be brides together<br> and young wives together.<br> And maybe someday<br> we'll be mothers too.<br> Edna, how can you?<br> Mentioning such a thing.<br> Well, why not?<br> I don't know about you...<br> ...but I'm going to have<br> five sons and five daughters.<br> Edna...<br> How do I look?<br> Damon's the luckiest living human.<br> I'd say Allan was.<br> I'd say we are.<br> Come on. They're waiting.<br> Here they are.<br> - Sweetheart.<br> - Darling.<br> I'm the happiest man<br> in the world, sweetheart.<br> Thank you, Allan.<br> I hope we'll always be happy.<br> I'm the happiest man in the world,<br> sweetheart.<br> Thank you, Damon.<br> I hope we always will...<br> What...? What is it, darling?<br> Nothing, I...<br> Damon, will you be an angel<br> and get me a handkerchief from Hilda?<br> Why, of course, darling.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> Father, I want to tell you about<br> this man's attention to business...<br> ...in the bank this afternoon.<br> - You can't tell me anything...<br> ...about Sam Gladney, my dear.<br> The Wisconsin County Bank<br> is backing him in a new business venture.<br> Thank you for the testimonial,<br> Mr. Kahly.<br> Do you know when I cashed that check<br> this afternoon, I shortchanged you?<br> - Is that so?<br> - He's come out here to make restitution.<br> Oh, no bother, sir. No bother at all.<br> There you are.<br> Thank you very much.<br> You may keep that dime<br> as a tip for your honesty.<br> Well, thank you very much,<br> but I'd rather have this dance.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> You see, it belongs to my fianc.<br> Oh, go ahead and dance with Mr. Gladney.<br> Go ahead.<br> You didn't shortchange me.<br> I counted the change<br> because I didn't trust you.<br> You're doggone right, Miss Edna.<br> I suppose I should have taken<br> a little more time to get acquainted.<br> But I leave tomorrow<br> to go back to Texas, in the flour business.<br> - How interesting.<br> - Your father asked me up...<br> ...a couple of times to meet the family,<br> but I didn't accept...<br> ...because I've been up to my neck<br> in this new flour mill of mine.<br> Gee, I wish I'd have known<br> you were here.<br> Don't tell me<br> I'd have rivaled the flour business.<br> You've come darn near it.<br> Thank you.<br> Is this the way they dance in Texas?<br> Shucks, yeah. We dance down there<br> to have fun. Why don't you?<br> We have other ideas of diversion,<br> I'm afraid.<br> I believe I've had enough of dancing.<br> Very well. All right, Miss Edna,<br> you're the boss.<br> But I'm not through talking yet.<br> I don't think you're the kind of a girl<br> who'd do a mean trick on a man...<br> ...by marrying him when you belong<br> by rights to somebody else.<br> - You're insufferable.<br> - Wait.<br> When you showed up at my window this<br> afternoon, my mind was miles away from...<br> Well, from girls or anything like them.<br> And when you shoved that check in at me,<br> something fairly shouted in my ear...<br> ...and said,<br> "Sam, that's the future Mrs. Gladney. "<br> Didn't you hear it?<br> Oh, I didn't mean to be fresh,<br> but I had to act quick.<br> I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'm going back to Texas...<br> ...and fix it up for you.<br> Polish the sun, sweep the prairies.<br> Spread out the welcome mat<br> along the old Red River.<br> And then next spring<br> I'm coming back to fetch you.<br> Is that so?<br> Do you want to know<br> what time my train leaves tomorrow?<br> It's of no interest to me whatsoever.<br> Well, it leaves at 10:58<br> tomorrow morning...<br> ...if you'd care to come down<br> and see me off.<br> Well. Here you are, dear.<br> Oh, thank you, Damon.<br> I've just been marking time<br> with Mr. Gladney till you got here.<br> - This is Mr. McPherson, Mr. Gladney.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - The man I'm going to marry.<br> Oh.<br> I've just been trying to dance<br> with Mr. Gladney. Texas style.<br> I'm afraid I don't know<br> very much about Texas.<br> Well, Texas is a great place.<br> Greatest place in the world to raise a family.<br> Have you a family?<br> Oh, no, no. Not yet.<br> I've only just picked out my wife.<br> Well, congratulations.<br> Would you like to shake on that, sir?<br> Why, certainly.<br> Dear, we're missing<br> most of this lovely music.<br> Just watch Mr. McPherson,<br> Mr. Gladney.<br> You'll get some pointers<br> on how to succeed in a ballroom.<br> Thank you.<br> All aboard.<br> All aboard, boss.<br> Better get this on the train, boss,<br> if you're going.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> Go on, wave. Wave.<br> - Edna.<br> - Sam.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Well, where is everybody?<br> Well, here he is.<br> - Yep. Here I am.<br> - Well, at last.<br> You know, I'm a little flustered.<br> Only the second time we've met,<br> and soon I'll have to call you "son. "<br> Mother.<br> And I'm sure this must be<br> little Charlotte.<br> - Hello, Sam.<br> - I think you rate a kiss too...<br> ...for getting Edna down at the station<br> that morning.<br> Oh, I knew it was all up with poor Damon<br> the moment I saw you.<br> Poor Damon.<br> He's been happily married<br> for three whole months.<br> Happily?<br> I'll bet he doesn't even know it.<br> Where's Dad?<br> - In the library...<br> ...going over some mysterious matter<br> with my future in-laws.<br> - Will you tell them Mr. Gladney has arrived?<br> - Yes.<br> - Mr. Gladney.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> What stand do you take<br> on the subject of double weddings?<br> - Double what?<br> Well, you see...<br> ...Charlotte and Edna graduated together,<br> they came out together, and now...<br> Oh, I see.<br> And now they want to be hitched<br> in double tandem, right?<br> Well, why not?<br> I think another victim might buck a man up.<br> - How do you like your tea?<br> - Me? Oh, straight, please.<br> Sam.<br> - Oh, hello, Dad.<br> Mr. Kahly.<br> - You're looking awfully well, sir.<br> - Thanks. How's the new mill?<br> Great. We plan on opening next month,<br> you know.<br> You remember the wheat<br> I was telling you about in Texas?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Take a look at that, sir. Give me your hand.<br> Isn't that wonderful?<br> Texas wheat.<br> Greatest wheat in the world.<br> Sam doesn't think much of Texas.<br> I'll think a lot more of it<br> when I get you down there.<br> Mr. Kahly, please.<br> - That's all I've got with me.<br> - Oh.<br> Children...<br> ...you go on with your tea.<br> We'll... We'll join you presently.<br> Come, Catherine.<br> Why, what is it, dear?<br> They want to speak to you in the library.<br> I haven't broached the double wedding yet<br> to Allan's mother.<br> Why not? You afraid?<br> Who, me?<br> I'm terrified.<br> Let me do it. I'm not terrified...<br> ...much.<br> No, you won't. She's my problem, darling.<br> I'll brave it out.<br> All right, darling, go ahead, brave it out.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Go on back, dear, please.<br> But what is it, Allan?<br> There's something<br> we've got to straighten out.<br> You run along back to your tea.<br> George, it's time<br> that child was told a little truth.<br> - Sarah, please.<br> - Yes, Mother, stop talking, will you?<br> What is it, Mrs. Keats?<br> Well, something has come out,<br> Charlotte, that...<br> That might seem to interfere<br> with your plans to marry Allan.<br> But what is it?<br> I haven't done anything wrong.<br> It isn't true. Whatever they're saying,<br> it isn't true. You know it isn't.<br> - I wish you were right, Charlotte.<br> - Sarah, please.<br> Unfortunately, it's come to our knowledge<br> that you were a foundling.<br> A nameless foundling<br> with an unknown father.<br> Sarah, how could you?<br> I...<br> - I didn't know I was nameless, Mrs. Keats.<br> - Except for the kindness of the woman...<br> ...in the license bureau,<br> it might never have come to light.<br> Whose business is it but mine?<br> It's anybody's business now.<br> It's common gossip.<br> Was it common gossip<br> before you started telling it?<br> George, don't, darling.<br> Why, Charlotte's an angel.<br> She's kind, gentle, sweet.<br> Why, from the day George and I took her,<br> she's been as dear to us as our own child.<br> And she's the only one<br> I'll ever marry, Mother.<br> Make up your mind to that.<br> Allan wants to take you away<br> for a while.<br> Yes. We'll go to someplace nice,<br> where no one knows us.<br> Away from his practice and his family.<br> Oh, Sarah.<br> - You'll wreck his life.<br> - Mother, stop it.<br> Run along, Charlotte, darling.<br> I have a plan to talk over with Allan.<br> Don't worry, dear.<br> We love each other,<br> and that's all that really matters.<br> Everything's going to be fine.<br> Oh, Charlotte.<br> Did she agree?<br> Do we get the double wedding?<br> Why not?<br> Did you hear that, dearest?<br> - Here's to double tandem.<br> Edna.<br> - Edna.<br> - Yes, darling?<br> What is it?<br> I want you to have this.<br> Charlotte! Charlotte!<br> Charlotte! Charlotte!<br> How about amalgamating?<br> Share losses as well as profits.<br> Well, maybe you're right, Charlie.<br> But do you see that sign out there?<br> Someday it's going to read,<br> "Samuel Gladney and Son.

Where is she?<br> She right upstairs.<br> Stave it off, if you can,<br> till the doctor gets here.<br> Just keep out of my way, will you?<br> Heat all the water you can, at once.<br> - Plain water?<br> - Heat it.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Are you sure you know what you're doing?<br> I have 60 babies a year. Do you?<br> Careful, now.<br> Can't you tell what color its eyes are?<br> Oh, look at that.<br> Are you ready for a visitor, darling?<br> Yes.<br> Careful, nurse.<br> Watch the step there. That's it.<br> I want to introduce you to my son.<br> Would you like him beside you,<br> Mrs. Gladney?<br> Cover him all up, now,<br> so he won't get cold.<br> Look at that.<br> You see,<br> this is one thing I disapprove of most.<br> The time is coming when newborn babies<br> will be kept in glass cages...<br> ...away from their parents.<br> Nurse. Take the baby<br> back to the nursery, please.<br> Yes, Dr. Breslar.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Doctor's orders, you know.<br> Remember what I said<br> about tiring the patient.<br> All right, doctor.<br> Come on. Come on. Come on.<br> Gee, you had me scared, sweetheart.<br> Oh, Sam. Did I?<br> Well, I'm all right now.<br> And so happy.<br> Well, that's enough for now. Come along.<br> See you soon, darling.<br> Bye-bye.<br> The record of the case<br> from the time I took over.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> And you haven't explained to Mr. Gladney<br> about your findings relative to her condition.<br> He's trying to say that motherhood,<br> in a case like your wife's...<br> ...is extremely dangerous.<br> I didn't know that.<br> Edna can never have another child, Sam.<br> Thank God she's safe.<br> - Or is she safe?<br> - Oh, absolutely.<br> Dr. Breslar handled this case<br> as well as I could've done myself.<br> Thanks.<br> Maybe I ought to start charging<br> as much as you do, doctor.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Dr. Breslar.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Gladney.<br> - Oh, goodbye, doctor.<br> - And a thousand thanks.<br> - Oh, well.<br> I hope we have occasion<br> to meet socially sometime.<br> - Well, I'm a busy man. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> I don't even have time to go fishing.<br> Don't fall, Daddy. Don't fall.<br> More, more.<br> - Daddy's sorry, but he's tired.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> Merry Christmas again, Cleo.<br> - Here's some more Merry Christmas.<br> - Oh, unwrap it, please, Cleo.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Here comes Nana.<br> Looks as though the jig were up.<br> Doesn't anybody want to go for a nice ride<br> and get some fresh air?<br> Nope.<br> I don't think it's so good<br> for folks to stuff their selves with air.<br> Listen, darling, Daddy's anxious to know<br> what's going on in the state of Texas...<br> ...so it's up to you to go find out about it<br> and come and tell him.<br> - No.<br> - You wouldn't want Dr. West...<br> ...to scold Mummy<br> because you missed your airing?<br> - No.<br> - That's a boy.<br> And we'll take little Chico with us.<br> And the engine.<br> - And the soldiers. And the Christmas tree.<br> - Don't you think...<br> ...that might be too much of a load<br> for the poor horse?<br> - We can only take one toy, Sammy.<br> - Which one's it going to be, partner?<br> I guess my old horse.<br> That's loyalty for you.<br> - Run along now, sweetheart.<br> - Come on.<br> - Watch me drive off, Mummy and Daddy.<br> - Yes, darling.<br> Hurry up, there. Get into that coat.<br> Goodbye, Master Sammy.<br> - Goodbye, Cleo.<br> - Away we go, now. Come on.<br> Have a good time.<br> We will. Wait, darling.<br> Oooh-ooh-ooh!<br> Look at this, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Heavens. What a monstrosity.<br> Well, it's from your aunt Louise, dear.<br> What? Cleo, do you suppose<br> you can break it?<br> Oh, no, sir.<br> I'm gonna take good care of this.<br> Give her time.<br> Goodbye, Mummy and Daddy.<br> Oh, honey, there they are.<br> Goodbye, Mummy and Daddy.<br> - Goodbye, darling.<br> - Bye, partner.<br> He would take that old calico horse<br> with him.<br> Oh, he's had a lovely Christmas.<br> You've been pretty extravagant this time,<br> Mr. Gladney.<br> Why not? Wheat's still going up.<br> That only cost me a few thousand bushels.<br> And I still have a little left.<br> Not counting what you have<br> in your pocket.<br> I don't carry wheat anymore.<br> What would you like to bet me?<br> - Well, what odds do you give me?<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> - Oh, no, you don't.<br> - You gotta catch me first.<br> - Sam. Wait.<br> - I know you have, Sam.<br> - Come on.<br> You're too slow, darling.<br> Oh!<br> - Now, let's see.<br> - Darling, I haven't got any wheat.<br> - No. No wheat.<br> - I'm awfully glad I didn't bet.<br> You know, I shall never be civilized.<br> I wonder how you stand me.<br> Oh, you don't take<br> such an awful lot of standing.<br> That's exactly what I was fishing for.<br> Bother our friends and the reception<br> and the eggnog and the whole business.<br> Why, Mrs. Gladney.<br> And you, a society leader.<br> I'm surprised at you.<br> - Tell me, are you happy?<br> - Oh, terribly happy.<br> Not a single little thing I'd change.<br> Except to have Charlotte with us.<br> How she and little Sam...<br> ...would have loved each other.<br> She was so gay and so full of fun.<br> Mr. Gladney! Mr. Gladney! Mr. Gladney!<br> - What's the matter, Zeke?<br> - Go back, Mrs. Gladney. Don't come down.<br> What is it?<br> Oh!<br> Sammy.<br> - Sammy, speak to me.<br> - Send for the doctor.<br> - What about the nurse?<br> They're bringing her in.<br> I'm here.<br> Darling? It's Mummy, darling.<br> Speak to me, Sammy. Speak to me.<br> Our baby's dead, Sam.<br> Our baby's dead.<br> Oh, I love parties.<br> - Be careful, Edna. That's precious.<br> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> I was getting so clever at this too.<br> There you are. There you are.<br> It's wonderful music, Edna.<br> - Oh, thank you, dear, I'm glad you like it.<br> Why, Mr. Gladney.<br> Enjoying yourself?<br> - I am if you're happy, sweetheart.<br> - Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Yes?<br> - Do you think you have time...<br> ...to step into the library a moment?<br> - What for, Zeke?<br> - A Dr. Breslar is there to see you.<br> - Dr. Breslar?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Well, bring him out here.<br> Darling, don't you think<br> you better see him inside?<br> Well, come to my rescue in a few minutes,<br> will you?<br> All right, sweetheart.<br> Oh, good evening, Dr. Breslar.<br> Hello, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Your husband once invited me<br> to come here socially.<br> Looks as if I picked out<br> a fairly social evening.<br> Well, I'm very glad to see you,<br> doctor. Always.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm on my way to the county orphanage<br> with her.<br> Seeing you are the only folks I know<br> with more beds than you sleep in...<br> ...I'd like to dump her here for tonight.<br> So if it's just the same to you,<br> she won't be much trouble.<br> And I'll come back for her<br> tomorrow morning, and then...<br> Well, doctor.<br> This is a pleasant surprise.<br> Isn't it, darling?<br> Haven't you two chosen<br> rather a bad moment for your conspiracy?<br> I happen to be entertaining Baron Emden.<br> Perhaps some other time<br> might've been better, doctor.<br> The child's mother<br> had to be sent to the hospital tonight.<br> There's no need<br> to take her to an orphanage.<br> She can be boarded out<br> until the mother's well.<br> Give Dr. Breslar a check, Sam.<br> The mother can't keep the child.<br> She has to work.<br> - If I had a child, I'd keep it in spite of...<br> In spite of what?<br> Parties, soires, dressmakers<br> and all that whoop-de-doodle?<br> - The child's mother is a mill-hand.<br> - It's a kiddie of a good family, darling...<br> ...whose mother has found it impossible<br> to earn her own living.<br> We might protect her.<br> Get that child out of here.<br> - Edna.<br> - I never thought it would work.<br> Come on, darling.<br> Why should she adopt babies?<br> She's much too busy adopting barons.<br> Come.<br> This is criticism, isn't it?<br> Darling.<br> You're trying to mend a broken heart<br> by hitting it with a hammer.<br> Well, do I ever bore you<br> with my broken heart?<br> Or anybody else? Do I ever mention it?<br> - It might be better if you did, sweetheart.<br> - All right.<br> Ever since the time I first realized<br> we were never to have children...<br> ...the day doesn't go by or the night<br> that I don't feel humiliated...<br> ...cheated...<br> ...useless.<br> Do you think I don't know that,<br> sweetheart?<br> Then why do you bring<br> another woman's child here to hurt me?<br> Darling, you're hurting yourself.<br> Oh, Sam.<br> Go on and cry.<br> Cry all you want to, sweetheart.<br> I'm no good for you.<br> Somebody else would...<br> Would be much better for you.<br> I'm no good.<br> Watch yourself.<br> You're talking about the girl I love.<br> Oh, Sam.<br> All right, now, darling.<br> Are you sure this is the place?<br> This is where they done told us<br> at the mill, sir.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Good morning.<br> I'd like to see Mr. Gladney.<br> Oh, yes, sir. Come right inside.<br> - Does you wants to rest your hat?<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Just step right into the parlor.<br> - Mr. Gladney?<br> - Hello, Mr. Gladney.<br> Oh, no, you...<br> You are not Mr. Gladney.<br> No, no, my name's Hedger.<br> G. Harrington Hedger of Fort Worth.<br> - Yes.<br> - Please, sit down, Mr. Gladney.<br> - Oh, how do you do?<br> - How do you do? Is this Mrs. Gladney?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm G. Harrington Hedger.<br> I came to speak to your husband,<br> if he could spare me a moment.<br> I think it can be arranged.<br> Sit down, won't you, Mr. Hedger?<br> Thanks. You have a nice lot of kiddies.<br> We think so.<br> - Hello, sweetheart.<br> - Hello, dear. This is Mr. Hedger.<br> - My husband.<br> - How do you do, sir?<br> Are you Mr. Gladney?<br> Why, yes, of course.<br> What do you think of our little family?<br> They're very cute.<br> Just wait till you take a look<br> at the rest of them.<br> Are these all yours?<br> Well, I don't claim them.<br> They belong to my wife.<br> - It's a day nursery, Mr. Hedger.<br> - For mothers who work.<br> They bring them here in the morning<br> and pick them up on the way home.<br> It's quite an innovation.<br> Yes. You see, my husband<br> wanted to adopt this little one.<br> But I couldn't bring myself<br> to separate her from her mother.<br> So we compromised.<br> I take her for daytime...<br> And she's added 19 others<br> to the collection.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> - Goodbye, Mr. Hedger.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Now, what was it you wanted<br> to see me about?<br> I have a message here from Mr. Jed Fraser<br> of the Fraser Mills in Fort Worth.<br> It's rather urgent on account of<br> the recent decline in the wheat market.<br> Yeah. Yes.<br> Well, I... I won't bother you any further,<br> Mr. Gladney. Goodbye.<br> - Oh, goodbye, sir. Thank you very much.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> When I built this mill,<br> I made a lot of mistakes.<br> - Next time, I'm gonna do the job right.<br> - Sam.<br> You've lost the mill.<br> I'll build another one.<br> Sweetheart, why didn't you tell me?<br> Oh, Sam, you're tired.<br> Why, honey, you look ill.<br> He isn't ill, Mrs. Gladney. He's insane.<br> Thinking he can pay off all these debts.<br> Why, he couldn't do it in 20 years.<br> Maybe you can get him<br> to go into bankruptcy.<br> Nobody else can.<br> Sam.<br> He doesn't understand, darling.<br> None of them do.<br> You wouldn't want me to fail<br> in my obligations, would you?<br> But, dearest, if it takes 20 years...<br> Would you?<br> No.<br> That's my Edna.<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...what am I bid for this superb specimen<br> of the music master's art?<br> Presented to Mrs. Gladney on her<br> wedding day by her own loving husband.<br> This here grand piano has been caressed<br> by the immortal fingers...<br> ...of the world's greatest and foremost<br> virtuosos of the art of the pianoforte.<br> So get going, folks.<br> What am I bid for a starter?<br> Fifty dollars.<br> What's that I hear?<br> Why, lady, you grieve me.<br> Any bid under a thousand dollars...<br> - That's all. Now you can close it, Zeke.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> I hear that Fort Worth is a mighty nice place<br> to live in, Mrs. Gladney.<br> And Mr. Gladney sure ain't gonna be<br> no mill-hand for very long.<br> The first thing you know,<br> he'll own a mill once more.<br> You've been a good friend<br> to both of us, Zeke.<br> Our very first luxury<br> would be to send for you.<br> Yes, ma'am, Mrs. Gladney.<br> I knows that, now.<br> Darling, look what I brought home<br> with me.<br> Max. I thought we said goodbye<br> last night.<br> Well, I wasn't going to let you ride into<br> Fort Worth without a bouquet, was I?<br> How sweet.<br> Uh-oh. Wait a minute.<br> Zeke. Get this eyesore down to the<br> auctioneer right away. He might forget it.<br> We never could get Cleo to break it.<br> - Dear?<br> - Yes, darling?<br> Is it all arranged?<br> About the nursery?<br> It's just been made safely over<br> to the mothers of Sherman.<br> And we got the city council<br> to vote funds for its support.<br> That's good.<br> That's wonderful.<br> Six dollars and 25 cents I bid.<br> Do I hear the seven? Do I hear the seven?<br> Six and a quarter, I have.<br> Who will make it to seven?<br> Seven I want. Who will make it a seven?<br> Six and a quarter I have.<br> Six and a quarter once.<br> Six and a quarter twice.<br> Six and a quarter, third and last time.<br> Sold to Mrs. Brown for $6.25.<br> Edna.<br> Why, Molly, how nice to see you.<br> We just couldn't resist taking<br> one last look at you.<br> Mrs. O'Neill, and Sarah,<br> and Helen and everybody.<br> Mrs. Gladney, we mothers of Sherman,<br> whose lives have been gladdened...<br> ...by your great work at the day nursery<br> have bought this little...<br> - This little... This little...<br> - Momonto.<br> - Memento.<br> - Memento as a token...<br> ...of our affectionate esteem, for you<br> to take to your new home in Fort Worth.<br> Thank you.<br> How sweet of you.<br> I'll keep it always in memory of you...<br> ...and the happiness we've had together<br> with our children.<br> Goodbye, you darlings.<br> I'll never forget you.<br> I'll send you a picture of Molly.<br> - Yes, do. Do. I'll write to all of you.<br> Let me know how things go,<br> Mrs. O'Neill. Goodbye.<br> I will.<br> - Goodbye.<br> We're gonna miss her terribly.<br> Well...<br> I've got to love the darn thing<br> as long as I live.<br> Hello, Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Hello.<br> Hello, Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Hello, Mr. Jason.<br> Well, come into the company's<br> private office, partner.<br> And sit right down there and take a look.<br> Put your eye up to that<br> and tell me what you see.<br> - I don't see anything but wheat.<br> - That's all it is. It's a special kind of wheat.<br> The wheat I've been telling you about.<br> The Gladney Wheat Wastage Process.<br> I'm off to register<br> these papers at the patent office.<br> Sam, you've been working through your<br> lunch for six months. As your partner...<br> ...I insist you eat your lunch<br> and I mail the papers.<br> Well, hey, wait a minute.<br> What are you going to do?<br> Mail the lunch and let me eat the papers?<br> Oh, Sam, you fluster me so.<br> Darling, you shouldn't get flustered<br> during business hours.<br> - Run along, now.<br> - Now, eat your lunch.<br> Certainly, I'll eat my lunch.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> That's all, Mrs. Gladney. If you take it<br> to the post office, it'll go quicker.<br> Thank you, I'll do that. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Come back here, Joey.<br> Come on back.<br> - You mustn't run away from Mama, son.<br> - He isn't mine. If he was, I'd fix him.<br> Get back in there and don't you<br> leave that seat again.<br> Get right back.<br> You must look on Mr. and Mrs. Northworth<br> as your real parents from now on, Clara.<br> And be an obedient daughter to them.<br> Yes, sir. I mean, Your Honor.<br> That's a good girl.<br> - Thank you, Your Honor.<br> - Thank you, Your Honor.<br> Come on.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Bedlow.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Bedlow.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Joshua Bedlow.<br> Here, Your Honor.<br> This way, please.<br> - Your name?<br> Joshua Bedlow.<br> And yours?<br> Mrs. Mary Ann Bedlow.<br> - Why, they're tagged like cattle.<br> Thirty-nine.<br> The state can't afford chaperones<br> for the orphans, ma'am.<br> They're from all over Texas.<br> Mrs. Taylor?<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> This boy's name is Tony. Tony...?<br> Just Tony, Your Honor.<br> Oh, I see.<br> The record shows the mother to have<br> been of reputable family, Mrs. Bedlow.<br> The baby has not been<br> very well looked after.<br> But, doubtless, under proper conditions...<br> ...sufficient food and care,<br> he will blossom out into...<br> I'm sorry, Your Honor, but...<br> Well, you see, judge, we live among<br> rather conservative people and...<br> You insist on legitimacy?<br> Yes, judge.<br> You'll have to take<br> the baby back, Mrs. Taylor.<br> Yes, Your Honor.<br> But, judge...<br> Ho, ho.<br> Where are you, sweetheart?<br> - Hello there.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> - Got a surprise for you.<br> - Have you?<br> Oh, darling, you worked all through<br> your lunch hour again.<br> I wasn't hungry. Wait till you see<br> who's going to spend the night.<br> Here?<br> Oh, Sam.<br> Why, it's Zeke.<br> I sure is powerfully glad to see you,<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> What do you know,<br> he's got a job in Fort Worth.<br> - Who are you going to work for?<br> - Why, I'm gonna work for y'all.<br> Now, look here, Zeke, you know<br> perfectly well we can't afford you.<br> Well, if you can't afford me for the work,<br> then I'll just sort of hang around.<br> And I know that nobody ain't gonna pay<br> a man nothing for just hanging around.<br> Except maybe his eating and sleeping.<br> Oh, but that wouldn't be fair, Zeke.<br> Fair to you, I mean.<br> Oh, but you'll be doing me a powerfully<br> big favor, Mrs. Gladney.<br> What have you done<br> since we left Sherman?<br> Well, I got odd jobs now and again.<br> But I didn't seem to get up no interest,<br> Mr. Gladney.<br> One day, along come a freight train,<br> and that freight train said to me...<br> ...he said, "Zeke, why don't you catch hold<br> and come on down to Fort Worth?"<br> And the first thing you know,<br> there I was and here I is.<br> Darling, we can take blankets out of<br> the spare room and fix him up in the shed.<br> Well...<br> - I, uh... I, uh...<br> - Huh?<br> Come along.<br> Well, what does this mean?<br> Sam, these children were up for adoption<br> at the court this afternoon.<br> You didn't neglect to register<br> and mail those papers?<br> No, of course not. They went out<br> on the 2:10. But, Sam...<br> ...I wish you could see<br> what goes on in that court.<br> Children are tagged. Tagged like cattle.<br> These two were turned down<br> because they were foundlings.<br> Judge let me have them. He's given me<br> two weeks to find them homes.<br> And Sam, I'm going to do it.<br> What's the baby's name, Mrs. Gladney?<br> Just Tony.<br> Tony.<br> And it's just two now, Zeke,<br> but she'll probably wind up with 40.<br> Well, I knows where I can get<br> plenty of help.<br> Shut your mouth, will you?<br> How you expect these children<br> are gonna get to sleep?<br> Is this Mrs. Gladney's establishment?<br> That's what the sign says.<br> Mrs. Gladney and her establishment.<br> You may wait.<br> - Does you wants to see Mrs. Gladney?<br> - I do.<br> Mrs. Gladney ain't here, ma'am.<br> She out ringing doorbells.<br> - Ringing?<br> She's raising money for the children.<br> But I had an appointment.<br> Children always come before appointments<br> with Mrs. Gladney, ma'am.<br> Just help yourself to a chair, thank you.<br> Hello, honeybunch. Hello, sweetheart.<br> Hello. Hello, son.<br> How do you do, Mrs. Gladney?<br> Oh, I am sorry to be so late.<br> I'm back, Tony.<br> Look at me, Tony.<br> - Has he been all right, Cleo?<br> - Right as he ever is. Poor little fella.<br> Sweetheart.<br> I'm Mrs. Marcus Gilworth.<br> I telephoned for this appointment.<br> Oh, yes, Mrs. Gilworth.<br> I'll be with you in a moment.<br> Would you mind counting this, please?<br> The baby's waiting, Mr. and Mrs. Loring.<br> - Just a minute.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> Mrs. Gladney, look at that.<br> It say 104.<br> - Did you wash it in nice hot water?<br> - Yes.<br> I thought so.<br> Everybody tells me always use hot water.<br> And I uses it and then I gets the devil.<br> Now, Mrs. Loring, here she is.<br> Come on, sweetheart.<br> There. Little Janice.<br> She's going to grow up to be a tomboy.<br> Just like you were once upon a time.<br> Why, Mrs. Gladney, how did you know...?<br> Oh, I spent months finding out<br> all about you.<br> You see, it isn't enough just to give a baby<br> to people who want a child.<br> They should love the same things.<br> They should, as far as possible,<br> have the same characteristics.<br> That's why I study the child<br> and its tendencies...<br> ...and I study the parents and theirs.<br> Then I try to match them.<br> That's why I know that this is your baby.<br> Look at her, Dora.<br> She's making eyes at me.<br> Why, Janice Loring, behave yourself.<br> - Janice Loring. Doesn't that sound great?<br> - Oh, Ned.<br> You must get her home before her resting<br> time. And here's her food formula...<br> ...and instructions for everything.<br> - Goodbye, darling.<br> - Bye.<br> Why, Mrs. Gladney, you're crying.<br> I work like fury to get them adopted...<br> ...and then cry like a fool when they go.<br> - I'll write to you every week.<br> - You will?<br> Of course.<br> Goodbye. Take good care of her.<br> Goodbye, Mrs. Gladney,<br> and a thousand thanks.<br> Janice Loring. Gee.<br> - Well?<br> - It ain't enough money by about $6.<br> I'll go out again this afternoon.<br> If I owned the milk company, Mrs. Gladney,<br> I'd let you have it for nothing.<br> - Thank you. I hope you do someday.<br> - Thanks.<br> Oh, yes, Mrs. Gilworth.<br> My husband and I decided to give<br> the advantage of our home...<br> ...to one of your foundlings,<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> - How nice.<br> - Course, we wouldn't want one that cries.<br> I see.<br> Well, will you step into the office?<br> Hello.<br> Oh, Max. I thought you'd never get here.<br> I'm sorry. I had six maternities<br> to wind up before I could leave.<br> I know, I know, Max.<br> But I've been so worried about Tony.<br> Here he is.<br> A redhead, heh?<br> I've had every specialist in Fort Worth,<br> and nobody's helped him. Nobody.<br> - Now, which leg is it?<br> - The left.<br> The left.<br> - What treatment has he had?<br> - All sorts. I've stopped giving him medicine.<br> I massage him. I give him sun.<br> Yeah, that's what he needs.<br> Especially massage, plenty of it.<br> There's a new method of massage<br> underwater. But it takes...<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> When I came here out of the goodness<br> of my heart, I didn't expect to be insulted.<br> Oh, Mrs. Gilworth, I am sorry.<br> But Dr. Breslar has come all the way from<br> Sherman and he's a very busy pediatrician.<br> Pedia... Pedia...?<br> She means a baby doctor.<br> Yes, I know.<br> This way, please, Mrs. Gilworth.<br> I'll be with you soon, doctor.<br> Oh, doctor. I'm adopting a baby.<br> Maybe you'd like to help<br> with your advice.<br> Come along, doctor.<br> I want you to see Tony's chart, anyway.<br> Sit down, Mrs. Gilworth, please.<br> I'd want to know all about the baby,<br> its background, parents and so forth.<br> Oh, yes, indeed. We have to be very<br> careful about the children...<br> ...and the prospective parents.<br> - Naturally.<br> Oh, I suppose you do.<br> Now, your full name,<br> Mrs. Gilworth, please.<br> That's Tony, I'm sorry.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> - Will you make this out for me, Max?<br> - Oh, sure.<br> Your name?<br> Gilworth. Mrs. Marcus Gilworth.<br> - Your husband's occupation?<br> - He's a member of the board of supervisors.<br> Two names of people<br> who would vouch for you.<br> I said my husband<br> was a member of the board.<br> How old are you?<br> Uh...<br> - Well?<br> - Thirty-seven.<br> What are you writing there?<br> Let me see.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Any TB in the family?<br> - No.<br> - Hereditary diseases?<br> - No.<br> - Insanity?<br> - No.<br> No insanity? Don't understand it.<br> Mrs. Gladney, you haven't heard<br> the last of this.<br> Adopting babies.<br> You are aware of the zoning laws<br> in the district...<br> ...where you run your institution?<br> Yes.<br> Then you know those laws<br> prohibit the running of an institution...<br> ...such as yours in that district.<br> The law makes no exceptions, you know.<br> But I've told you<br> I'd find another place for them.<br> We appreciate your good intentions,<br> Mrs. Gladney...<br> ...but Fort Worth has an adequate<br> poor farm and city orphanage.<br> But don't you see? I'm able to get children<br> into homes, real homes...<br> ...to interest people in adopting babies<br> who might never have thought of it.<br> The city has had very few complaints<br> over our treatment of orphans.<br> Oh, I wish<br> you'd stop calling them orphans.<br> - What do you call them, Mrs. Gladney?<br> - They're children. Our children.<br> Every child born into this world<br> belongs to the whole human race.<br> Don't you think that's a few too many<br> for your budget, Mrs. Gladney?<br> - I move we put this to a vote.<br> I second the motion.<br> All right. Those in favor<br> of granting Mrs. Gladney's request...<br> ...to carry on her work,<br> signify in the usual manner.<br> Aye.<br> Aye.<br> - Those against.<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> - No.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Gladney. If you're<br> able later on to show adequate funds...<br> ...and a proper building to house children,<br> we'll be very glad to open the matter.<br> Thank you.<br> Why, Max. How sweet of you<br> to come and meet me, but...<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> I think you'd better run home<br> and see Sam.<br> Home?<br> He... I made him stop work<br> for the rest of the day.<br> - But what...?<br> - He had one of those fainting spells.<br> - Oh, Max.<br> - Don't worry, Edna.<br> I'm sure he'll be all right.<br> Oh, Sam.<br> Silly of me to fold up like this, isn't it?<br> Darling, look in my inside coat pocket.<br> Remember when<br> I used to carry wheat in my pocket?<br> I was saving that<br> for your next box of gladiolas, Thursday.<br> Look at it.<br> The company has bought out<br> the Gladney Process.<br> You'll soon be in the clear.<br> You must rest now.<br> What do they want you to do<br> about the babies?<br> It doesn't matter, sweetheart.<br> I'm through with all that.<br> No.<br> Don't you let them beat you.<br> You'll never desert, Edna. Never.<br> You'll win.<br> Fight for those kiddies of yours...<br> ...if you have to ring every doorbell<br> in Texas.<br> Edna.<br> Take me in your arms.<br> Hold me close.<br> Sam.<br> Max.<br> Max!<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Tony.<br> - Yes?<br> - I want to see Mrs. Gladney.<br> Yes. Come in.<br> - Oh, did you wish to see me?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Well, will you wait?<br> And I'll be with you as soon as I can.<br> - Hello, sweetheart. What is it?<br> - I wanna be with you, Auntie Edna.<br> I know, but there's<br> lots of other little boys and girls...<br> ...that Auntie Edna<br> has to arrange things for.<br> Now, you wouldn't want her<br> to neglect them, would you?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - No, you wouldn't.<br> I think little Oliver is ready,<br> Mr. and Mrs. Howard.<br> Texas Children's Home and Aid Society.<br> Auntie Edna.<br> Now, you run along out into the sunshine<br> and we'll be together this evening...<br> ...the whole evening long.<br> - And will you play me some music?<br> Yes, of course I will.<br> All right.<br> Come along.<br> - Is that little fellow up for adoption too?<br> - Not until we get him well and strong.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Howard, your son.<br> He's just as I've always dreamed.<br> - I guess he'll do.<br> - You guess?<br> There's kind of a suspense, though,<br> wondering how he's going to turn out.<br> Well, Mr. Howard, the average isn't bad.<br> You see, there's Andrew Jackson,<br> for instance, and Andrew Johnson...<br> ...Rutherford B. Hayes,<br> James Garfield...<br> ...Stonewall Jackson,<br> Billy Sunday, Booker T. Washington...<br> ...Cardinal Hayes and Lloyd George.<br> You don't mean to say<br> they were all orphans?<br> Every one of them.<br> Come on, Oliver. That's the boy. There.<br> Oh, look, Ted.<br> He isn't unlike Andrew Jackson.<br> - Well, I guess we'll take a chance.<br> - It's no chance, believe me.<br> It's the best investment<br> you ever made in your whole life.<br> - Bless you. Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Gladney, and thank you.<br> - We'll invite you to his inauguration.<br> - I hope so.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> Oh, Cleo, ask Dr. Breslar<br> to bring down little Frederick.<br> Yes.<br> - Will you come in, Mr. La Verne?<br> - Sure.<br> - Sit down, won't you?<br> - Thanks.<br> I've... I've just received your baby's tests<br> back from the hospital, Mr. La Verne, and...<br> - You're not gonna take the kid.<br> - Oh, no. Oh, no, it isn't that at all.<br> Everything's in order<br> for you to give the baby up...<br> ...and for me<br> to find a good home for him.<br> Gee, you had me scared there<br> for a minute.<br> The reason I sent for you again,<br> Mr. La Verne...<br> ...is because you're all he's got<br> in the world...<br> ...and I thought<br> you might like to say goodbye to him.<br> I see.<br> Hello, doc.<br> Hi, you little sucker.<br> Hello, Frederick.<br> Where are you going to be from now on,<br> Mr. La Verne?<br> Over the border in Mexico.<br> I'll be managing a dance hall.<br> - Oh, is that permanent?<br> - Sure.<br> There.<br> Oh, look here, I don't know<br> how to hold a kid, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Try.<br> You see, I never let parents separate<br> from their babies...<br> ...without doing everything<br> to make them realize what they're doing.<br> Here. I'm afraid I might drop him.<br> Oh, go on, please.<br> I wish you'd take him with you.<br> You could engage a housekeeper<br> where you're going...<br> ...and make a little home for him.<br> Listen, you're never going to find<br> another soul in all this world...<br> ...who'll be as close to you<br> as your own son.<br> Now, look, Mrs. Gladney...<br> ...I wasn't even gonna let my wife<br> keep the kid if she lived.<br> Now, what am I gonna be doing with him?<br> You might grow to be great pals.<br> You could bring him up to be<br> a fine young man, keep him out of trouble.<br> Meaning he'd keep his old man<br> out of trouble. Is that it?<br> Well, it would be good for both of you.<br> Now, don't dramatize things, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Will you take this?<br> You know, that's the trouble<br> with you girls that never had a kid.<br> I'm going to take him upstairs<br> to be disinfected.<br> So long, kid. Keep your pants pressed.<br> What's eating him?<br> Nothing. Your little son<br> will be well cared for, Mr. La Verne.<br> Well, that's fine. It's been a pleasure<br> meeting you, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Goodbye.<br> Will you come in?<br> Sit down, won't you?<br> Mrs. Gladney, I have some money<br> that I haven't any use for.<br> - I'd like to give it to you for the children.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Why, this... This looks like quite a sum.<br> - It's around $ 700.<br> Why are you giving me this money?<br> I was adopted from an institution myself,<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Wait a moment.<br> Where are your adopted parents now?<br> Well, this is May, isn't it?<br> That's the season in Cannes.<br> I suppose my mother would be there.<br> My father's in New York.<br> He's always busy.<br> I wanted to give you the money. You put<br> children in homes where they belong.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Wait.<br> - Can you tell me what's troubling you?<br> - I'm afraid I can't.<br> - Have you a child?<br> - No.<br> - Are you going to have one?<br> - No.<br> Never. Never.<br> Come and sit down.<br> Tell me about it.<br> Maybe I could help in some way.<br> I'm engaged to be married.<br> We'd made such plans, Alfred and I.<br> I've just found out<br> that I haven't a right to a name.<br> To any name.<br> I found it at the record of my birth.<br> The record I'd have to show<br> when we went for our wedding license.<br> Would he care?<br> I'm not gonna see him again,<br> Mrs. Gladney, not ever.<br> Just a minute.<br> Tell Dr. Breslar<br> I want to see him immediately.<br> Yes, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Will you let me have your purse?<br> Let me have what you have in it.<br> - There isn't anything in it.<br> - Please.<br> Please, let me have it.<br> Max, throw this...<br> Throw this away, will you?<br> Max...<br> ...for years<br> I've been haunted by something...<br> ...something that once<br> came very close to me.<br> The injustice of branding<br> innocent, little, nameless children...<br> ...in records where everyone can see.<br> On birth certificates...<br> ...of branding them all through life,<br> in marriage licenses...<br> ...passports, legal documents.<br> It's cruel, inhumanly cruel,<br> but there's a way it can be stopped.<br> I realize that now.<br> Max, the word "illegitimate" has<br> gotta be removed from the vital statistics.<br> But, Edna,<br> illegitimacy has had to be recorded...<br> ...since the beginning of records.<br> Then it's time it's stopped.<br> This didn't just happen, Max.<br> There was a purpose in her coming here,<br> and if you're as fine as I think you are...<br> ...you're not going to cheat<br> the man you love.<br> You're going to marry him right now.<br> Fight for his happiness and your own.<br> I had a friend as dear to me as a sister<br> who had the same problem you have.<br> She died for it.<br> But I know now she didn't die in vain.<br> Max, I used to think<br> that taking little nameless babies...<br> ...loving them and finding homes for them<br> was all that could be done...<br> ...but it isn't. I know that now.<br> I know my course,<br> and it's as clear as daylight.<br> Every human being born into this world<br> deserves the right...<br> ...to make its own good name<br> without bigotry and prejudice.<br> I'm going to fight for that right<br> for every child in Texas.<br> And it's because there's only one way<br> to remedy this tragic situation...<br> ...that I appeal to you for help,<br> and that way...<br> ...is to remove the word "illegitimate" from<br> the birth records, past, present and future.<br> I don't like to discourage you, but I'd say<br> such a bill had no chance of being passed.<br> Would open up a hornet's nest.<br> Why, it would be a direct blow<br> at the sanctity of the home, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Sanctity of the home?<br> But that's exactly what I'm fighting for.<br> One can't override the tradition<br> and prejudice of centuries, Mrs. Gladney.<br> What you propose would arouse<br> the antagonism of so-called good people.<br> Surely that's what leaders are for,<br> to fight intolerance and overcome prejudice.<br> How would you think of proceeding,<br> Mrs. Gladney?<br> People have hearts.<br> Let's try to reach them somehow.<br> - Auntie Edna.<br> - Yes, darling?<br> Why do you go away and leave me?<br> Auntie Edna had to see a lot of senators<br> about helping all the little children.<br> Are senators people?<br> Some of them are.<br> - Auntie Edna.<br> - Yes, sweetheart?<br> - Do you love all the other little children?<br> - Of course, darling.<br> - More than me?<br> - Oh, my darling.<br> Why, Auntie Edna loves you more<br> than anything in the whole wide world.<br> She doesn't want to leave you.<br> Not ever.<br> Not for one single little moment.<br> Then why can't I go with you<br> when you go away?<br> You can when you're well and strong.<br> You'll be my little escort and protector.<br> Keep me company and look after me.<br> When I get big,<br> will I be your big protector?<br> Of course, darling. Always.<br> You don't take care of children here.<br> All you do is play with them.<br> Gramophone music, animals<br> on the ceiling, lions, giraffes, elephants...<br> - But babies couldn't see them on the floor.<br> - But babies couldn't see them on the floor.<br> - Did you just get in, Edna?<br> - This morning.<br> - Take a sleeper?<br> - No.<br> Well, what do you think you are made of?<br> Cast iron?<br> - Does that hurt you now, sweetheart?<br> - No, ma'am.<br> - What reaction from your senators?<br> - Oh, the same old thing.<br> "Not since the Magna Carta, madam,<br> has so radical a procedure been suggested. "<br> That's funny, Auntie Edna.<br> No, it's not, son,<br> because there isn't any comeback.<br> But the Magna Carta went through.<br> You are wasting your time, Edna.<br> You are acting foolishly.<br> You are wearing yourself out<br> with a wild-goose chase.<br> You have got to save yourself<br> for what you can do.<br> I need Sam, Max.<br> I need his courage to go on.<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Yes, Zeke?<br> There's some ladies in your office<br> that says they've got to see you right away.<br> - Very well, and I wanna see you, Zeke.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Dry him and put his brace on,<br> will you, Max?<br> No, I want you to stay, Auntie Edna.<br> - Oh, Dr. Max will put the brace on.<br> I want you.<br> Buckle on the brace is a little loose, Max.<br> We'd better get it fixed.<br> Yes, I see.<br> Here, darling.<br> When did you buy me the horsie,<br> Auntie Edna?<br> Oh, a long, long time ago.<br> - You take good care of that.<br> - I will.<br> Just a minute, Tony.<br> What is it that you wanted me to do?<br> - Edna.<br> I'm sorry I upset you.<br> I lost a case last night.<br> Oh, Max.<br> The Eldridge boy.<br> I brought him into the world.<br> His parents are taking it pretty hard.<br> That would be a wonderful home<br> for little Tony.<br> - For Tony?<br> - You have done a great job, Edna.<br> He'll be out of that brace<br> before you know it.<br> Mrs. Gladney,<br> what is it you wanted me to do?<br> Come here, Zeke. You'll have to rig up<br> a crib for a couple of newcomers.<br> Two more babies, Mrs. Gladney? I can't.<br> All right. You tell them so.<br> I'm not going to.<br> I declare for goodness that...<br> Whoo-oo!<br> Deuces wild.<br> - I'm gonna fix them up right away.<br> - Well, I thought so.<br> - Any mail, Tess?<br> - Yes, a little.<br> What about my birthday note<br> to Janice Loring?<br> - Oh, I mailed it.<br> - Fine.<br> - Good morning, Mrs. Gladney.<br> - Good morning.<br> What can I do for you?<br> Mrs. Gladney, we've come to demand<br> that this long fight...<br> ...you've been putting up<br> for immoral legislation cease at once.<br> Immoral, ladies? In what way?<br> Because it encourages the young<br> to be bad.<br> We realize you think you're doing right,<br> Mrs. Gladney.<br> But nice people have to be segregated<br> from those who are evil.<br> What do you mean by "evil"?<br> And by "nice"?<br> Look out here a minute, please.<br> There are 12 children out there.<br> I happen to know that three of them<br> are what you term "illegitimate. "<br> I'd like you ladies<br> to pick out those three.<br> This is your answer to our request, then?<br> Somebody once told me I'd never desert.<br> I hope I never shall.<br> This is your final decision, then,<br> Mrs. Gladney?<br> I'm afraid so.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Very well.<br> Come, ladies.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> Look here, Max.<br> It's from Senator Cotton.<br> "Dear Mrs. Gladney,<br> I have at last created an opportunity...<br> ...to introduce your bill in the legislature<br> next week. "<br> What's that?<br> "The opposition, however,<br> is pretty strong...<br> ...and as I have not had time<br> to prepare as I would wish...<br> ...you had better come at once to Austin<br> and advise our committee...<br> ...on the points you state so ardently. "<br> Max, I leave for Austin today.<br> - This afternoon.<br> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Gladney.<br> I hate to butt in this way,<br> but I'm in a hurry.<br> The name's La Verne. Bert La Verne.<br> Remember?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Come on in, Charlie.<br> Mrs. Gladney, I have cause to believe<br> you took that kid of mine...<br> ...and turned him over to somebody<br> with plenty of dough.<br> Who is it?<br> That's a question I can't answer,<br> Mr. La Verne.<br> Now look here, Edna.<br> I know you're not running this place<br> for your health.<br> You took my kid<br> and sold him to somebody.<br> So I'd like to collect on him myself.<br> - I think you'd better be on your way.<br> - Max.<br> Now, who is it?<br> Who's got my kid?<br> You're wasting your time, La Verne.<br> Okay, Charlie. Give her the letter.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> But don't you see, Your Honor...<br> ...I'm pleading for a father<br> and a father's rights.<br> Some time ago, my client...<br> ...dazed...<br> ...broken...<br> ...almost out of his mind<br> through the death of his beloved wife...<br> ...took his little newborn son<br> to Mrs. Gladney.<br> He asked Mrs. Gladney<br> to keep the child...<br> ...until he could make a home for it<br> somewhere.<br> This, Mrs. Gladney promised to do.<br> My client then went to Mexico<br> and found work.<br> Hard work. In a cheap dance hall.<br> But he didn't mind the hours<br> or the humiliation...<br> ...or even the heartbreaking exhaustion,<br> because he was doing it for his son.<br> He saved every penny he had...<br> ...until at last he had enough money<br> to send for his child.<br> His little Frederick.<br> My client wrote Mrs. Gladney,<br> asking for the little one.<br> She refused.<br> Then we started to investigate.<br> And we learned that a paper<br> Mrs. Gladney had forced him to sign...<br> ...the day he brought the child to her...<br> ...had been a legal relinquishment<br> of the child for all time to come.<br> Yet even so, judge, the love my client<br> bears his child is great enough...<br> ...that if he finds the boy getting along<br> all right, as Mrs. Gladney claims...<br> ...he's willing to sacrifice<br> the only thing in life that he holds dear.<br> And go his way alone.<br> All I'm asking, judge,<br> is to see my little boy...<br> ...to know he's happy.<br> According to the law, a parent<br> may demand knowledge of a child...<br> ...only if there is any doubt<br> as to the environment in which it lives.<br> My client has such a doubt, judge.<br> Mrs. Gladney, you will tell<br> the complainant where his child is.<br> If you refuse, I shall be compelled<br> to confine you in jail for contempt of court.<br> I'm ready to go to jail, Your Honor.<br> Judge Hartford, my client is<br> putting up a fight in the legislature...<br> ...that requires<br> her immediate presence in Austin.<br> Is there any way sentence<br> can be postponed?<br> If you refuse to answer,<br> Mrs. Gladney...<br> ...the law insists I find you<br> in contempt of court.<br> I'm ready to go to jail.<br> Mr. Rader.<br> I have reason to believe<br> that I'm not qualified to try this case.<br> I'm going to ask that it be transferred<br> to another court.<br> For your information, Mr. La Verne...<br> ...there's a very adequate law<br> against blackmail in the state of Texas.<br> Go on to Austin, Mrs. Gladney.<br> And God bless you.<br> This court's adjourned.<br> Was it the baby he adopted?<br> Wonderful.<br> We, in this country, gentlemen,<br> are blessed with a constitution...<br> ...conceived in the sublime<br> and unshakable faith...<br> ...that all men are created equal.<br> I ask you how, under that constitution...<br> ...we can endure the law of illegitimacy<br> as it stands today?<br> How can we let little children...<br> ...from the time they are old enough<br> to understand the meaning of the word...<br> ...ponder on its dreadful implication?<br> Mr. President.<br> The law is no place<br> for quixotic and expensive illusions.<br> Mr. President.<br> It would cost the state of Texas<br> hundreds of thousands of dollars...<br> ...for the reissuing<br> of old birth certificates alone.<br> Order. Order. Order. Order.<br> Chair recognizes Senator Cotton.<br> Mr. President.<br> Persons branded as illegitimate...<br> ...must pay the same taxes<br> everybody does.<br> And yet they cannot enter the civil service<br> of their country.<br> They cannot marry<br> without exposing their tragedy.<br> They cannot have children<br> without passing on that shame...<br> ...as a black and bitter heritage.<br> Bravo, senator.<br> - Mr. President. Mr. President.<br> The passage of this bill in Texas<br> would result in anarchy.<br> It'd leave our families,<br> our loved ones unprotected...<br> ...and open to association<br> with creatures of shame.<br> If those who transgress the moral code...<br> ...aren't punished for breaking the rules<br> of decency...<br> ...what's left to hold society in check?<br> Do I hear correctly,<br> Mr. Senator? Punished?<br> Mr. Senator, did you say punished?<br> Yeah.<br> Order, order, order.<br> I declare a 10-minute recess.<br> Go ahead, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Members of the Senate may walk out<br> if chivalry is dead in Texas.<br> EDNA;<br> Thank you, Mr. President.<br> Gentlemen.<br> If you don't know what it means<br> to a mother who loves her child...<br> ...to give it up to strangers<br> knowing she'll never see it again...<br> ...never hold it in her arms...<br> ...never hear it call her "Mother"...<br> ...come to my home in Fort Worth<br> and see.<br> I'll show you punishment<br> that will haunt you all the days of your life.<br> I've put hundreds of little<br> nameless babies into respectable homes.<br> Fine homes.<br> And all of them,<br> without one single exception...<br> ...are growing up to be<br> morally fit and strong.<br> Madam.<br> This is resolving into the old argument<br> of what shapes human destiny:<br> Heredity or environment.<br> That argument has never been answered yet<br> by the scientists.<br> Then ask the scientists to come to me.<br> I'll tell them.<br> I never knew a child take a wrong step...<br> ...that couldn't be traced to the ones<br> who are bringing it up.<br> To misunderstanding.<br> Lack of honesty.<br> Lack of heart.<br> She's evading the issue.<br> If this law goes through,<br> it will encourage bad girls to have babies.<br> Bad girls don't have babies.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Life can be made<br> so much more beautiful by love...<br> ...by sympathy and understanding...<br> ...that it ever can by intolerant rules<br> and laws and regulations.<br> I've seen hearts broken.<br> I've seen a pure and innocent<br> young life...<br> ...destroyed by the inhumanity<br> of this man-made law.<br> For it is man-made.<br> God has placed no dishonor<br> on these innocent and helpless victims.<br> Oh, believe me, gentlemen,<br> there are no illegitimate babies.<br> There are only illegitimate parents.<br> Merry Christmas Eve, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Here's a telegram for you.<br> Why, Zeke, I thought you and Cleo<br> had gone on to your party.<br> Not yet, Mrs. Gladney,<br> though all the nurses is gone.<br> If you're nervous here alone...<br> Oh, I'm not alone. I have little Tony.<br> Yes, ma'am, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Merry Christmas, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> - Here's a Christmas present for you.<br> - Is this for me?<br> It sure is. The best you ever had.<br> Why, this is Tony's.<br> Merry Christmas, Auntie Edna.<br> Darling. Darling.<br> Look, I can walk.<br> Oh, my darling. My darling.<br> This is the bestest Christmas<br> we all has ever had.<br> Ain't it the truth? Glory be.<br> May I walk all I want to, Dr. Breslar?<br> The more the better.<br> But you have done enough<br> today, old fellow.<br> It's getting late now.<br> Way past your bedtime.<br> Oh, no.<br> Tony. Tony.<br> You have to hang up your stocking.<br> Don't you know?<br> Yes. Now, run along, dearest.<br> - Good night, Zeke. Good night, Cleo.<br> Good night, Tony.<br> Get your shoes off, sweetheart.<br> I'll be right in.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Dr. Breslar.<br> Good night. Sleep well<br> and dream of playing football.<br> Good night, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Good night, Zeke.<br> We'll get him a bicycle next Christmas.<br> Good night, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Good night, doctor.<br> - Good night.<br> - Have a good time.<br> I'm taking my own mistletoe.<br> Well, Max, the ordeal's over.<br> "Birth certificate bill passed<br> by healthy majority.<br> Merry Christmas. T.R. Cotton. "<br> Good work, Edna.<br> No, Max, the credit isn't mine.<br> It's hers. Charlotte's.<br> Have it your own way.<br> Well, Edna, one ordeal is over,<br> the next is all ready and waiting for you.<br> Why, what is it, Max?<br> Come on.<br> There we are. You got him?<br> Here, put the pin in it.<br> That's right.<br> I don't wanna get my clothes pinned.<br> Now that's got it.<br> Now, let's hope Santa Claus<br> fills it way up.<br> - So your name's Tony?<br> Yes, sir.<br> This is Mr. Eldridge. Mrs. Gladney.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Gladney?<br> - How do you do?<br> He has a swimming pool, Auntie Edna,<br> right in his own yard.<br> And seven puppy dogs and a pipe organ.<br> Your little ward and I find we have<br> a lot in common, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Have you?<br> What are you doing down here?<br> I came down to hang up my stocking.<br> Yes, well, go back to your room at once.<br> Now, be careful going up the stairs.<br> - I'll be right up to put you to bed.<br> Yes, Auntie Edna.<br> I suppose Dr. Breslar has told you,<br> Mrs. Gladney...<br> ...that my wife and I<br> recently lost our little boy.<br> I know. I'm sorry.<br> Leta hasn't been well since it happened.<br> There seems to be a question<br> that she may not be well again.<br> I mean ever, Mrs. Gladney.<br> I see.<br> This Christmastime is very hard on her,<br> remembering back to other Christmases...<br> ...when we had him with us.<br> The doctors feel that if they could<br> put another child into her arms...<br> ...a child that we could keep,<br> that would be our own...<br> ...it might make all the difference.<br> Dr. Breslar told me about little Tony.<br> And now that I've met him,<br> I feel he'd be ideal for us.<br> - Why, we took to each other right away.<br> - I can't let you have Tony.<br> It's a question of her reason, Mrs. Gladney.<br> Of her life.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well, if I could give you money<br> for the home.<br> That couldn't possibly enter into it.<br> The boy belongs somewhere else.<br> I'll see that the home does its best for you,<br> and as soon as possible.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Gladney.<br> I'll leave you my address.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, Dr. Breslar.<br> And a thousand thanks to you<br> just the same.<br> This isn't the first sacrifice<br> you have ever been asked to make, Edna.<br> And it won't be the last.<br> You must think of the boy now. Of Tony.<br> If it hadn't been for me,<br> Tony would have died.<br> I gave him his life.<br> He loves me.<br> He belongs to me.<br> Yes, Edna.<br> You gave him his life.

I don't think so, darling.<br> Because, you see,<br> I'm just your Auntie Edna.<br> And I'm lots of other children's<br> Auntie Edna too.<br> This lovely lady will be your mommy,<br> your very own mommy.<br> And you'll have a daddy too,<br> like other lucky little boys.<br> Come along now, sweetheart.<br> I mustn't cry, must I, Auntie Edna?<br> No, you mustn't cry.<br> Oh, my darling.
