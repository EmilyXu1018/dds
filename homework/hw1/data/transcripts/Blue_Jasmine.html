                        There was no one like Hal.<br> He met me at a party<br> and swept me off my feet.<br> "Blue Moon" was playing.<br> - You know "Blue Moon?"<br> - Sure.<br> I still remember that.<br> And one more year<br> and I would have graduated.<br> But I quit BU to marry him. I mean,<br> what was I learning at school anyway?<br> I mean, can you picture me<br> as an anthropologist?<br> Is that a joke?<br> The sex was always great.<br> Well, he was nine years older than me.<br> He'd already made<br> and lost a fortune.<br> But then he made it back, and more.<br> I mean, much more.<br> God, he was dynamic.<br> Taught me everything I know<br> about real lovemaking...<br> ...not that I care<br> to get too graphic.<br> Believe me when I tell you.<br> They tried six medications on me.<br> Cocktails, they call them.<br> The only cocktail that helped<br> was a Stoli martini.<br> I never trusted doctors.<br> Doctors put both my parents<br> in early graves.<br> I have never been<br> to San Francisco.<br> And Hal and I traveled everywhere.<br> I hear it's beautiful.<br> I'll be staying with my sister, Ginger.<br> She's divorced.<br> Biologically, she's not my sister.<br> She's adopted. We're both adopted.<br> I couldn't stand her ex-husband.<br> He used to hit her.<br> That's mine. The Vuitton.<br> My plan is to start<br> a new life out here.<br> Put everything behind me<br> and start fresh.<br> Go West. Was it Horace Greeley<br> who said that? "Go West. "<br> Oh, there's my family.<br> It was really nice talking to you.<br> Oh, I'll call you, maybe for lunch.<br> I don't have your number.<br> - Who's that woman you were talking to?<br> - I was sitting next to her on the plane.<br> She was talking to herself.<br> I thought she said something to me.<br> I said, "What?"<br> But she couldn't stop babbling<br> about her life.<br> Where...?<br> Where am I exactly?<br> You said 305 South Van Ness.<br> - Can you wait, help me<br> with my bags? - Sure.<br> I don't know where she is.<br> She expected me.<br> The plane was on time.<br> - Yes, I'm...<br> - You all right?<br> I'm fine. I just sometimes get<br> where I can't take a deep breath...<br> ...and when I can, it makes me panic<br> and it makes it even worse.<br> Okay.<br> - Could I have some privacy?<br> - Sure, sure.<br> Hello, Ginger?<br> Yes, I'm here.<br> I'm right in front of the place.<br> It is 305?<br> Well, how long?<br> What?<br> Where is it?<br> No, no, I see it.<br> Okay. Oh, okay.<br> Just- Would you please hurry?<br> My sister left the keys in the bar.<br> - Can you wait?<br> - Sure!.<br> Is that it?<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Have a great day, all right?<br> Bye-bye.<br> - So, what do you think?<br> - I love it.<br> The fireplaces work.<br> I don't like when they're for show.<br> It's so light and airy<br> and the ceilings are so high.<br> How can anyone breathe<br> with a low ceiling? The view...<br> - You wanted Fifth Avenue.<br> - Central Park. Superb.<br> Oh, this space is perfect.<br> We hardly have to do a thing.<br> - You shouldn't spoil me so.<br> - Well, why not?<br> Who else am I gonna spoil?<br> Did I tell you my news?<br> - What? - Danny is<br> gonna be living with us.<br> Oh, honey.<br> Oh, that's great news.<br> I worked it out with his mom,<br> her lawyers.<br> Oh, he'll be so much happier<br> when he's with us full-time.<br> Happy birthday, Danny.<br> Kids at school say we're really rich<br> and that you give money to charity.<br> Sure I do. You gotta remember<br> as you go through life...<br> ...to share what you earn<br> with the less fortunate.<br> Not everyone is as<br> lucky as we are.<br> - Domingo?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Another bottle of the Margaux.<br> - Sure.<br> Excuse me.<br> - It would look perfect.<br> - Wouldn't wash me out?<br> No, not at all. Not the way he...<br> Oh, isn't he sweet?<br> This song was playing<br> when Hal and I first met.<br> - I fell in love with the name Jasmine.<br> - Oh, so romantic.<br> I changed it.<br> Yeah, Jeanette had no panache.<br> This song was playing<br> when we first met.<br> You know it? Yeah, we met<br> at a party at Martha's Vineyard.<br> "Blue Moon. "<br> Come on, boys.<br> Okay, let's go, Augie.<br> I gotta get home. Someone's waiting.<br> We helped Dad<br> move the furniture today.<br> Oh, really? That's your idea<br> of taking the boys?<br> Letting them help you lug<br> somebody's furniture upstairs?<br> - They loved it. Great exercise.<br> - Yeah?<br> - They- We ate franks<br> and beans. - Yeah.<br> - Relax. - Okay. Let's go,<br> Johnny, come on.<br> - Come on. Let's go. Come on.<br> - What's the rush?<br> What's the rush, Ginger?<br> You got a date?<br> It's none of your business.<br> - It happens to be Jeanette, so...<br> - Jeanette?<br> Jasmine?<br> What is she doing in town?<br> She's living with me<br> till she gets back on her feet.<br> She's had a bad time. Yeah.<br> When she had money,<br> she wanted nothing to do with you.<br> Now that she's broke,<br> she's moving in.<br> She's not just broke.<br> She's screwed up.<br> And it's none of your damn<br> business. She's family.<br> - She stole our money.<br> - Okay.<br> Understand? We could have been set.<br> That was our whole chance in life.<br> For the last time, Augie,<br> he was the crook, not her, okay?<br> What the hell did she know<br> about finance?<br> Don't stand there and tell me that.<br> She's married to a guy for years...<br> ...up to his ass in phony real<br> estate and bank fraud.<br> She knew nothing about it?<br> Believe me, she knew, Ginger.<br> Okay? She knew.<br> But when all those diamonds<br> and minks were flying in...<br> - ... she just looked the other way.<br> - I don't think so, Augie.<br> You said it. You said to me,<br> "She's a phony and had to know. "<br> Jasmine, your country house<br> is so beautiful.<br> - See? - I'm sorry, but we<br> need an answer on this.<br> I told you, you change the<br> name of the corporation.<br> - Operate under Global Innovations.<br> - I don't know if we can.<br> I think we can, actually.<br> - Pay out of the accounts in<br> Amsterdam. - Amsterdam.<br> Whenever I hear them, they're one step<br> ahead of the Justice Department.<br> Just hope your<br> house is not bugged.<br> Oh, I never pay attention<br> to Hal's business affairs.<br> I have no head for<br> that sort of thing.<br> - We transfer to the old corporation?<br> - We could. Perfectly legal.<br> - It would be a mistake under that name.<br> - Definitely get in trouble for that.<br> Just don't file a joint tax return.<br> Don't say that. I sign anything.<br> I'm very trusting.<br> Famous last words.<br> It's called looking the other way.<br> Jasmine.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Look at you.<br> - Look at you.<br> Oh, I am so sorry for the wait.<br> - Sorry, I think I'm in Paris.<br> - It's okay.<br> - No, it's fine.<br> - Augie's day with the boys.<br> Well, no wonder you're late.<br> - Hello. Matthew, is it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Boys, say hello.<br> I told you about her, remember?<br> - Hi, I'm Jasmine.<br> - Shake hands. Okay, go play.<br> - They're big.<br> - I know.<br> - I'm getting it first.<br> - Quiet, you two.<br> - Well, they're loud.<br> - Stop running around.<br> Christ, this kid's got...<br> What the hell is it? ADD?<br> - Yeah. Your place is homey.<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> No, I mean, it"s got a very...<br> Well, it's casual charm.<br> God, knock it off, Jasmine.<br> I need to stay here<br> for a while. No, I do.<br> - I'm out of cash.<br> - Okay.<br> Couldn't pay my rent in Brooklyn.<br> Can you believe...<br> ...I had to move out of my home,<br> take a place in Brooklyn?<br> But I'm dead broke. Really,<br> the government took everything.<br> And the lawyers.<br> And I can't be alone, Ginger.<br> I really get some bad thoughts<br> when I'm alone.<br> Well, you know, all I can say is,<br> you look great.<br> - Now who's lying?<br> - You do.<br> You know, I was up all last night.<br> I was so anxious...<br> - ... about moving here.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I wasn't sure how angry<br> you still were. - Oh, well...<br> - Another drink? We're celebrating.<br> - Of course, yeah.<br> Oh, the flight was bumpy.<br> I didn't eat anything on the plane.<br> Oh, the food was awful. Here it is.<br> I mean, you'd think<br> first class, right?<br> You flew first class?<br> I don't know how anyone puts up<br> with those airlines.<br> - Isn't first class a fortune?<br> - Yes, I was quite shocked.<br> - I thought you were tapped out.<br> - I'm worse than tapped out, baby.<br> I've run up some serious debts.<br> So how did you fly first class?<br> I don't know, Ginger.<br> I just did.<br> All I meant was, if you've got<br> no money, to go first class...<br> You know me.<br> I splurge from habit.<br> Would you stop staring<br> at my luggage?<br> Yes, it's Louis Vuitton.<br> - You told me you had to sell everything.<br> - Look, look, look.<br> These are used, old suitcases.<br> See, with my initials. Who'd want them?<br> I sold what jewels and furs<br> I could hide from Uncle Sam.<br> God, I hate to tell<br> you about that.<br> Jewelry is priceless, a great investment<br> when you buy it at Graff or Van Cleef...<br> ...until you're desperate for money<br> and forced to sell...<br> ...and then it seems<br> you can't give it away.<br> Kids, stop it, come on!<br> - Were you adopted?<br> - Yes.<br> We were both adopted.<br> Born to different moms and dads,<br> but raised by the same mom and dad.<br> Could you stop doing that<br> gun thing? Sorry.<br> - Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.<br> - Matthew.<br> Did you like the new mom and dad?<br> - Yes, of course...<br> - Aunt Jasmine did.<br> I ran away from home<br> as fast as my feet could carry me.<br> - How come?<br> - Well...<br> Our mother liked Aunt Jasmine<br> and not me.<br> - Oh, stop.<br> - How come?<br> - She had better genes.<br> - Don't tell them that.<br> - Well, am I lying?<br> - Dad said you're glad we lived far away.<br> What?<br> They're perfect for the dress<br> that I'm wearing to the Met Gala.<br> What's the matter?<br> Your mind is a million miles away.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. No, I...<br> I just got a call from my sister, Ginger.<br> Oh, God, she's coming to New York<br> for a week with her husband, Augie.<br> He is a piece of work.<br> I just... I don't know,<br> I guess I have to see them.<br> - The one in San Francisco, the builder?<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, no, he's a contractor.<br> I mean, he's... No, he's a handyman.<br> No, don't get me wrong.<br> I love Ginger, I do. She's a dear.<br> But our paths just went<br> in totally different directions.<br> Okay, that happens.<br> It's terrible of me to say,<br> but she was never too bright.<br> You know? And she was so wild<br> and I, of course, was Miss Perfect.<br> - Hi.<br> - Oh, you made it.<br> - How lovely to see you.<br> - Hi. Oh, my God.<br> - Welcome.<br> - Hi. Thank you.<br> - Oh, this is my husband, Augie.<br> - Augie.<br> - This is Jeanette.<br> - Jasmine. I changed it.<br> - Jasmine. - I'm finally<br> getting to meet the sister.<br> I know. Hello. I'm so sorry<br> we couldn't make it to the wedding.<br> Just that Hal had some business<br> in Saint-Tropez.<br> - Couldn't get back in time.<br> - Know what?<br> You missed a nice little party.<br> My friend Dennis sang.<br> - He's great. Dennis Rackabuto.<br> - I know. Hey...<br> Hal! You remember Ginger.<br> - Oh, my gosh.<br> - How are you?<br> - How are you?<br> - This is Augie.<br> - Augie. How you doing?<br> - Awesome.<br> - Hell of a place you got.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Why don't you come through?<br> - Told you.<br> - Yvette, coffee?<br> - This is really...<br> Yeah, she's got taste.<br> It's like what you<br> see in the movies.<br> We have so much to catch up on.<br> Can't wait for you to show us New York.<br> Why don't you take<br> our car and driver?<br> Well, I hope you're gonna come.<br> I mean, how often am I here?<br> - No, no, I will definitely make<br> some time. - Oh, good.<br> Where are you staying?<br> Oh, well, we... We thought about<br> asking if we could stay with you...<br> ...but we don't wanna impose,<br> so we got a room at the Marriott.<br> - Oh, the Marriott's perfect.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'll have my office contact them<br> and forward us the bill.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - No, no, no, it's not necessary.<br> Please, you're our guests.<br> I insist.<br> Oh, well, then we insist<br> on taking you two to dinner tonight.<br> - What? Tonight?<br> - Yeah.<br> We have dinner plans.<br> I don't think we can...<br> Something we can't get out of.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - There'll be time.<br> We stashed the kids with Augie's sister,<br> we're here for a week.<br> - It's gonna be great.<br> - It is. Okay.<br> Well, we don't have<br> a lot of free time...<br> ...but we'll definitely take you<br> to Le Cirque, won't we?<br> I mean, or Daniel. I mean...<br> - They'd get a kick out of that.<br> - Yeah, absolutely.<br> I know your birthday is this week.<br> Let us at least take you out for that.<br> - I love how you're doing your hair.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> You'll have to take me shopping.<br> You always could pick clothes.<br> And Augie's got<br> some exciting business news...<br> ...he wants to talk to Hal about.<br> Don't worry, I don't need<br> to borrow money. We're flush.<br> - Yeah, - What kind of<br> work do you do, Augie?<br> Well, you know,<br> I do, like, repairs, furniture moving...<br> ...but I got plans to be my own boss.<br> We'll talk about it over dinner.<br> They're going out.<br> Hey, could we have a tour?<br> Oh, yeah, of course.<br> Why don't you start in the kitchen?<br> - Is there a little girls' room?<br> - Just down the hall.<br> Five days.<br> I'll have to invite them<br> to my birthday party now.<br> - Where did she come up with him?<br> - I always feel so guilty around Ginger.<br> We've got to make sure<br> we make their stay extra nice.<br> My God, five days.<br> Look.<br> It's so beautiful.<br> Oh, but where would I wear<br> a Fendi bag?<br> Oh, go ahead.<br> It's my treat.<br> - No.<br> - Yeah.<br> Really?<br> Oh, my God.<br> I love it. Look.<br> Look.<br> - Take the other one off.<br> - No, I like this.<br> Boy, this is some place you got here.<br> - I mean, this is unreal.<br> - It is.<br> Reminds me of when I was a kid.<br> I used to be a lifeguard.<br> Start your own construction company?<br> Great idea.<br> - We came into some money.<br> - Tell him how, Augie.<br> Well, the first 10, 12,000,<br> I really worked for.<br> Put away a little each week.<br> But he's not telling<br> you the big news.<br> - Why we're in New York.<br> - You tell them.<br> Okay, I will.<br> We always play the lottery...<br> ...and we never even get two numbers.<br> Am I right?<br> But last week, we hit it.<br> We got 200,000 bucks.<br> Oh, that's fantastic.<br> - I thought I'd drop dead.<br> - That's great.<br> I never held that kind of money<br> in my hands. I mean, ever.<br> He was shaking when we won.<br> Me? You had to see her. I had to tell her,<br> this is a once-in-a-lifetime.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Yeah.<br> He wants to begin a business.<br> What do you think?<br> Well, if you like, I think Hal<br> could probably help you do better.<br> Yeah?<br> You know- You know, I'm no gambler.<br> I mean, not with my one chance to-<br> Hey, come on. We don't know<br> the first thing about money, but he does.<br> First thing is how not to give half<br> your money to the government.<br> Look, I know there's taxes,<br> but, I mean, what can I do?<br> - There are ways.<br> - You see, Augie? You see?<br> Suppose I put you in a venture<br> that was low-risk, but very high-yield.<br> I'm not talking about 6 or 7 percent.<br> I'm talking about 20 percent.<br> - Profitable enough?<br> -20 percent?<br> He's developing a group of hotels<br> in the Caribbean.<br> You mean,<br> not starting my own business.<br> No, we mean investing with Hal.<br> Jeez, investing what?<br> You mean the whole thing?<br> You need money to make money.<br> Am I right?<br> Ginger.<br> Let them in on one of your-<br> The hotel deal or something.<br> It'd be great for them. Make a killing.<br> - Pay attention, Augie.<br> - I'm paying attention.<br> You will make money for them,<br> won't you?<br> I make money, they make money.<br> God, they're hard work.<br> Tomorrow I'm taking the day off.<br> I've neglected everything,<br> my yoga, my Pilates.<br> I've got that luncheon to plan...<br> ...the fundraiser<br> for the Central Park Conservancy.<br> I've rented them a limo and a driver...<br> ...and I've suggested they go<br> to the South Street Seaport.<br> Can you imagine if they lived here?<br> Here, for doing your duty.<br> Happy birthday.<br> I'm giving it to you now so you can wear it<br> to your party tomorrow night.<br> Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.<br> Not bad taste<br> for a philistine businessman, huh?<br> - I know, it's so extravagant.<br> - Oh, look at that.<br> He surprised me in the tub,<br> so to speak.<br> Corsica's a bore. The weather's nice,<br> but it's nothing like Sardinia.<br> This year you are coming<br> to Palm Beach, no excuses.<br> - Hey, Jasmine.<br> - What?<br> - Who's that woman?<br> - Which?<br> - That one.<br> - Oh, Raylene.<br> She's a friend. I love Raylene.<br> We met in a yoga class.<br> - Isn't she pretty?<br> - Yeah.<br> She runs a modeling agency.<br> - How long have you known her?<br> - Few years. Why?<br> - And you trust her?<br> - Trust her?<br> Of course I trust her.<br> What kind of question is that?<br> She just seems so cozy all night<br> with your husband.<br> I wouldn't worry. Hal's not<br> the roving type, nor is Raylene.<br> - She's a very close friend.<br> - I don't know.<br> If it was my husband,<br> I'd keep an eye on him.<br> Goodness, you are a suspicious one.<br> - I'm just saying.<br> - Just relax.<br> I am relaxed.<br> You shouldn't drink so much, Augie.<br> Nobody wants to hear<br> those stupid Polish jokes, you know?<br> Oh, I had a drink?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah?<br> Let me tell you, you were half in the bag<br> the entire night, okay?<br> Tell me about my drinking.<br> - Give me that.<br> - What's eating you?<br> If you saw your friend's wife kissing<br> another guy, would you tell your friend?<br> - What?<br> - Would you tell your friend?<br> - I'm talking.<br> - Tell him what?<br> Are you listening to me?<br> If you saw your friend's wife kissing<br> another guy, would you tell your friend?<br> - Would you tell him?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Bet your ass I'd tell him.<br> - But what if it causes trouble?<br> Or maybe a divorce?<br> If you don't say anything,<br> it could've been a passing thing.<br> He never knows and he lives on<br> happy with his wife.<br> You know, I would tell him,<br> because that's what a friend's for.<br> You gotta have his back.<br> That's why I'd tell him.<br> It's a tough call, Augie. I don't know.<br> - Ginger?<br> - What?<br> What are we doing?<br> Are we playing charades?<br> I mean, come on.<br> - Did you see something?<br> - Yeah.<br> On the street, by accident.<br> I saw Hal kissing that brunette<br> who was at the party.<br> You saw Hal kiss Raylene? Raylene?<br> You know her name too?<br> My God, she gets around.<br> Oh, we were introduced.<br> Come on, you got nothing to worry about.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Nobody could ever take your place.<br> Yeah, believe me,<br> I wasn't thinking she'd look at you.<br> - Nobody would ever look at me, right?<br> - Right.<br> - You looked at me.<br> - Yeah, once. It was a mistake.<br> - All right, listen.<br> - What?<br> You think Hal's banging her?<br> When Jasmine don't wanna<br> know something...<br> ...she's got a habit<br> of looking the other way.<br> Thank you for my present.<br> I got so many comments.<br> I think everyone enjoyed themselves<br> and that piano player was-<br> He was fantastic. I got his card.<br> What were you talking to Raylene<br> so intensely about?<br> Oh, her husband is thinking about<br> getting his own plane.<br> I was just weighing the pros and cons<br> for her of a Challenger versus a-<br> - Gulfstream?<br> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - She's so pretty.<br> - Yeah.<br> Bill's out of town for a couple weeks<br> and she'll be all alone.<br> I thought maybe we could take her out<br> to dinner or have her over here.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Great.<br> Sure.<br> - This is silly, Ginger.<br> - Why?<br> - It's Sunday.<br> - So?<br> It's his day off.<br> He wants to spend it alone with you.<br> He's alone with me plenty.<br> If I'm gonna marry Chili,<br> you're gonna meet him sooner than later.<br> I told him we'd show you the town.<br> - Well, he won't want your sister around.<br> - Will you stop it?<br> This city is so beautifully European.<br> Have you ever been abroad?<br> - At all?<br> - No.<br> We used to sail<br> from Saint-Tropez to Cannes...<br> ...and up the coast to Monaco.<br> - It reminds me of the Mediterranean.<br> - There's Chili.<br> - Which one?<br> - There.<br> - Who's that with him?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Chili.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi, hey.<br> - You look beautiful.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> - Yeah.<br> - You smell good too.<br> - You're late.<br> - Eddie. Nice to meet you.<br> - Hi. Ginger. Hi.<br> This is Jasmine.<br> - Jasmine, hi. I'm Eddie.<br> - This is Eddie.<br> - Nice to meet you. Eddie.<br> - I'm Jasmine.<br> - Hi.<br> - Ginger told me about you.<br> Oh, all good, I hope.<br> I gotta tell you, I was all set<br> to move in with your sister.<br> Then she tells me that we gotta postpone<br> because her sister's in town.<br> - He's joking.<br> - Well, I hope I didn't inconvenience you.<br> It was an emergency.<br> - No.<br> - Things happen. Right, Eddie?<br> Could've happened to anybody.<br> Told me you never been here,<br> don't know anybody...<br> ...so I brought along this sad excuse<br> for a blind date.<br> - Best he could do on short notice.<br> - He works with me.<br> I gotta get a beer.<br> - You want a beer?<br> - Can I buy you a drink?<br> - I have a drink, but thank you.<br> - I'm dropping dead of hunger.<br> This place has the best clams.<br> You like clams, Jasmine?<br> No, no, no. I'm not hungry.<br> What the hell are you drinking?<br> Let me see. What is this?<br> - Is it vodka?<br> - Martini.<br> - This place has the best clams in the city.<br> - The best are at Manero's.<br> - You're nuts. They don't even compare.<br> - Who cares?<br> This place is good too. They're fresh.<br> That's the thing with clams.<br> You get a bad clam,<br> you'll wish you were never born.<br> - So, what do you do, Jasmine?<br> - I told you, she just got here.<br> - She's looking for a job.<br> - Yeah?<br> I know a dentist who's looking for help.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - No, I'm actually thinking...<br> - ... of going back to school.<br> - School?<br> To study what?<br> I don't know. I mean,<br> the biggest mistake I made...<br> ...was leaving college in my last year<br> and not completing my education.<br> What would you be?<br> An anthropologist.<br> Really? Like digging up old fossils?<br> That's an archaeologist.<br> Ginger told me the whole story.<br> That must be terrible, right?<br> One minute you're on top of the world,<br> the next-<br> - Guy turns out to be a crook.<br> - Yeah.<br> Her husband, he owned racehorses.<br> - Is that so?<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, yes, yes, for a year or two...<br> ...Hal became quite obsessed<br> with thoroughbreds.<br> So, what are you gonna study<br> in college?<br> Let me guess.<br> A nurse.<br> Is that how I impress you?<br> - A nurse?<br> - You got something against nurses?<br> - My sister's a nurse.<br> - Nurses are very hot to go to bed with.<br> They have extensive knowledge<br> of how the human body works.<br> - Careful what you accuse my sister of.<br> - Just saying, I know a few good nurses.<br> Chili, why don't you<br> change the subject?<br> You think you're being charming,<br> but you're not.<br> You always stare into space like that?<br> I had a friend who used to do that...<br> ...but there was something wrong<br> with him. He was epileptic.<br> I'm not epileptic.<br> If you see the waitress,<br> I'd like another Stoli martini.<br> - What are you gonna study?<br> - Leave her alone.<br> - It's like the third time you asked.<br> - So? She hasn't answered.<br> I don't know, but I'll be sure<br> to keep you informed.<br> - Oh, okay, sorry. I'll back off.<br> - I'm sorry, I don't mean to be curt.<br> I just don't know what I'm gonna do<br> with the rest of my life.<br> - What do you wanna do?<br> - Why don't we take her to see the sights?<br> Then back to my place. She likes vodka.<br> My buddy's just back from Russia.<br> - Brought me this incredible vodka.<br> - Great idea.<br> - You're gonna love my place.<br> - Yeah, let's go.<br> - Wait till you try this vodka.<br> - All right, man.<br> I wish my apartment had a garden.<br> - We didn't take her inside Alcatraz.<br> - Thank you.<br> - They got tours in there, Jasmine.<br> - Ginger said your ex-husband did time?<br> He'd still be doing time<br> if he didn't hang himself in his cell.<br> - Really? Like with a belt?<br> - Well, it had to be a belt. Or a bedsheet.<br> - Could be a bedsheet.<br> - No.<br> He managed to get a piece of rope.<br> Plain rope.<br> You can get anything if you got juice.<br> That's some way to go.<br> Strangle yourself to death?<br> No, it wasn't strangulation.<br> When you hang yourself,<br> your neck breaks.<br> I wouldn't feel sorry for him.<br> He hurt a lot of people.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Yeah, including me and Augie and her.<br> A lot of people are under<br> the misapprehension you strangle...<br> - ... but your neck snaps.<br> - Okay, we got it.<br> He was a bad guy, you know?<br> He lived like a big shot<br> on other people's money.<br> - And he played around behind her back.<br> - No.<br> - Jasmine, go and start your cooldown.<br> - Oh, good.<br> - Hey, Jas.<br> - Yeah?<br> I know you don't wanna go<br> to the Yankee game tonight.<br> I'd go to any sporting event with you,<br> you know, but I just never got baseball.<br> - I thought I'd ask Melanie. She's a fan.<br> - Oh, sure. God, she'll be thrilled.<br> - Hey, Mel?<br> - Yeah?<br> - You like baseball, right?<br> - I love baseball. Why?<br> I got two season tickets<br> behind the Yankee dugout for tonight.<br> I don't have anybody else to go with me.<br> Are you free?<br> Absolutely, if you're sure<br> there's nobody else.<br> No.<br> - No, no, you'll do just fine.<br> - All right, thanks.<br> - This is where you live? Nice.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hey, can you grab the groceries for me?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I can get this one.<br> - Get them.<br> - You got it? All right.<br> - I got it.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - That's okay, don't worry.<br> - No more vodka for you.<br> - I didn't have any vodka.<br> - I didn't have no vodka.<br> - I know about you.<br> Hey, hey, come here,<br> come here, come here.<br> - Take it upstairs?<br> - Yes?<br> - Yeah.<br> - All right.<br> Eddie wants your phone number.<br> - Why?<br> - I think he wants to call you.<br> I think he wants to ask you out,<br> you know, for dinner.<br> - Look, I'm busy at the moment.<br> - He's a terrific guy. Look at him.<br> Well, why doesn't he ask me himself?<br> Because he's shy, you know?<br> He thinks he's short.<br> Look, I'm concentrating<br> on school, okay?<br> - And getting a job.<br> - That's perfect.<br> Right, he knows this dentist.<br> No, I have no interest<br> in being a receptionist.<br> What did you have in mind,<br> running a bank?<br> - Is this what you wanted to talk about?<br> - And how long you're planning...<br> - ... on staying with Ginger.<br> - Oh, right. It's just till I find my feet.<br> We have a lot of big plans.<br> Don't worry, I'm not gonna ruin<br> any of your big plans.<br> No one wants to get out of here<br> as fast as I do.<br> I'm sure this is a big comedown<br> from what you're used to.<br> It's fine. It's- I'm grateful for her help.<br> So you don't want Eddie to call you?<br> No, I'm not ready to go out<br> at the moment.<br> Ginger said<br> you had a nervous breakdown.<br> She tends to be quite dramatic.<br> Said you were in the street,<br> talking to yourself.<br> You know, I don't think<br> that this is any of your business.<br> No, but since I'm marrying her,<br> we don't have any secrets between us.<br> - What did Chili want?<br> - Oh, nothing.<br> His retarded boyfriend wanted a date,<br> but he was too shy to ask.<br> - What do you think of Chili?<br> - He's very anxious to move in with you.<br> Yeah, I know. He's got the hots for me.<br> Can I speak frankly?<br> - You hate him?<br> - Yeah.<br> I could tell you two didn't hit it off.<br> He's another version of Augie.<br> He's a loser.<br> Hey, didn't I hear Eddie say<br> he knows a dentist looking for help?<br> Oh, forget it! Jesus, it's too menial!<br> I'd go nuts.<br> I wanna go back to school.<br> I wanna get my degree and become,<br> you know, something substantial.<br> I can't just do some mindless job.<br> I was forced to take a job selling shoes<br> on Madison Avenue.<br> Oh, so humiliating.<br> Friends I'd had at dinner parties<br> at our apartment came in...<br> ...and I waited on them. I mean,<br> do you have any idea what that's like?<br> You know, one minute,<br> you're hosting women...<br> ...and the next, you're measuring<br> their shoe size and fitting them.<br> Erica Bishop came into the store.<br> She saw me<br> and was so embarrassed for me...<br> ...she slipped out<br> thinking I didn't see her.<br> I saw you, Erica!<br> Are you okay?<br> Hey, you got great taste.<br> Maybe you could do something<br> in fashion.<br> Or designing. Yeah?<br> - Yeah, that's true.<br> - Yeah.<br> Everyone used to say<br> I'd make a good interior decorator.<br> There's courses,<br> but, you know, they cost money.<br> No, Eve Logan<br> got her decorator's license online.<br> On a computer?<br> I guess you could, but-<br> Yeah, I'm so computer illiterate.<br> But I could take a class in computers.<br> And then when I can handle a computer,<br> then I can study decorating online.<br> - That sounds too complicated.<br> - Why is your reaction always negative?<br> I'm just saying.<br> You know, first you gotta<br> learn computers...<br> ...and then go for a decorator's<br> license online.<br> You're afraid I'll stay here too long.<br> No, you know-<br> Just all those courses,<br> they cost money.<br> You'll work out here. It's mostly phones<br> and keeping my appointments straight.<br> There's the follow-up cards,<br> which I explained...<br> ...and the notices for cleanings.<br> Any questions?<br> Tell Dr. Flicker it's an emergency.<br> - Come on, come on.<br> - Yes?<br> What?<br> Yes, a cancellation.<br> Oh, you want to cancel.<br> - When?<br> - Please.<br> Wait, wait, wait. You said the 24th.<br> My husband has an abscess.<br> Can you just put someone on<br> who speaks better English?<br> The software interface<br> is what provides you, the user...<br> ...the ability to control the hardware,<br> the computer.<br> Okay, that's the operating.<br> The operating system<br> gives you that ability.<br> I need an appointment in two weeks.<br> Is the 1 Oth good for you?<br> The 1 Oth. Yes, fine.<br> Oh, better make it the 12th.<br> - Oh, we're all booked on the 12th.<br> - Okay.<br> Make it the 14th.<br> - The 14th?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Is 3 good on the 9th?<br> Or noon on the 11 th?<br> Can you just settle on a time, please?<br> Just pick a time.<br> Remember the yoga class.<br> Deep breath.<br> Breathe deeply.<br> All right, deep breath.<br> If you take a deep breath,<br> you can smell the honeysuckle.<br> - Beautiful. Make a great perfume.<br> - It would.<br> - Your polo pony's in great shape.<br> - Thank you.<br> - No, I have never seen a polo match.<br> - Really?<br> My husband's a fanatic. Not to say<br> he's good at it, but it keeps him busy.<br> We got a flight to catch.<br> Hal's taking Danny to Augusta<br> for the Masters.<br> They're golf degenerates.<br> I'll be home alone.<br> - We'll be back in three days.<br> - Did we tell you?<br> - Danny was first in his class at Harvard.<br> - No.<br> - Yes.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thanks.<br> - He's a math genius.<br> He's the genius. Dad did a guest lecture<br> at the business school...<br> ...and everyone said<br> it was the best lecture.<br> Naturally I became an instant<br> celebrity on campus.<br> Hey, I need your signature<br> on these, baby.<br> Be careful. Don't get hit by a golf ball.<br> That's how Ray Becker died.<br> You know, a little blue bruise<br> on his temple.<br> What are you always studying<br> in your spare time?<br> Well, I'm trying to learn<br> to use a computer.<br> I wanna study interior design online.<br> Oh, you wanna be a decorator?<br> Yeah, it's where my strongest gifts are.<br> You know, I have a natural flair<br> for space and color...<br> ...and an eye for choosing<br> soft furnishings.<br> It's very commendable, but I can't really<br> have you studying on work time...<br> ...if it interferes<br> with the business at hand.<br> Yes. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.<br> Please, see that it doesn't.<br> - I was gonna ask you a question.<br> - Yes?<br> Would you have a drink with me?<br> A drink?<br> I'd love it if you could.<br> Well, it would have to be a quick one...<br> ...because, you know,<br> I'm meeting my boyfriend for dinner.<br> I was just saying...<br> ...you can tell an awful lot about people<br> when you look in their mouths.<br> Are they conscientious?<br> Are they disciplined? Are they vain?<br> Or careless?<br> You have to know what to look for.<br> Do you have the time?<br> I have to keep an eye on it.<br> I've got homework.<br> This computer thing is proving<br> a little more difficult than I imagined.<br> It's funny, really, because I used to be<br> a straight-A student in college.<br> You know, but they say every year,<br> millions of brain cells just die off.<br> You have good teeth.<br> I'm sure you get<br> many compliments on them.<br> - Well, thank you.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know,<br> you're a very beautiful woman.<br> Are you serious with your boyfriend?<br> I don't mean to pry.<br> God, life is complicated.<br> Have you ever had any children?<br> How do you expect me to react<br> when my father is unmasked...<br> - ... as a common thief?<br> - You can't just drop out of Harvard.<br> No, it's too humiliating.<br> I wanna die when I see what he's done.<br> - How he lied, stole, ruined people.<br> - I know-<br> He is a sleazy criminal.<br> But if you drop out, you will be<br> throwing away your whole future.<br> You think I could ever face anybody<br> up at school?<br> My father, who I bragged<br> to everyone about?<br> The financial genius, generous,<br> the philanthropist?<br> He's such a phony.<br> He's a cheap crook.<br> His charitable contributions<br> with stolen money.<br> Well, just think how he feels.<br> He was arrested in the street.<br> - It's in all the papers.<br> - How can you look at him?<br> Did you not suspect anything<br> or did you not care?<br> - What does that mean?<br> - It didn't pay for you to ask questions.<br> Think I would have allowed him<br> to set up corporations under my name?<br> Sign accounts? This is no cake walk.<br> I could get indicted.<br> He's done nothing but lie over the years.<br> He is a con man and a hypocrite.<br> This is how you respond, by squandering<br> your life to get even with him?<br> Don't try to find me, because you won't.<br> He's a fucking bum. Let's go.<br> Let's go, let's go. Get out of the clinch.<br> - Hey. Hey.<br> - That's it, pop the jab.<br> Hey, guys, keep it down.<br> My sister's trying to study.<br> When can we stop tiptoeing around?<br> - Pop the jab.<br> - She'll hear you.<br> Well, I don't care.<br> I work hard all week. I wanna relax.<br> - Let's go, come on.<br> - Let's go. Work the body.<br> - The guy's just standing.<br> - Look.<br> And Bruno makes it easy,<br> because he just pushes himself forward.<br> Her sister, she had millions.<br> Turned out she married a crook.<br> Look, where was she<br> when she was loaded...<br> ...and you were tending bar,<br> waiting tables?<br> Now family's family?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah, nice. You can see the money.<br> - I know.<br> - He's right.<br> Is it possible,<br> without ruining any of your fun...<br> ...that you could lower the TV a bit?<br> Hey, Jasmine, why don't you<br> stop working for a bit? Have a beer.<br> Believe me, I wish I could.<br> What kind of work are you doing?<br> I'm trying to work a computer...<br> ...but it seems I have no aptitude for it.<br> Hey, listen, I just-<br> I want you to know...<br> ...it's great when a grown-up continues<br> with their education. Not for nothing.<br> Well, my goal is to<br> study interior decorating online.<br> Why don't you just go<br> to decorator school?<br> Well, I have to use my days to work<br> and pay my way.<br> As Hal said,<br> "It's not the money, it's the money. "<br> Yeah, okay, but, you know,<br> life ain't all work and no play, right?<br> Ginger says between work and school,<br> you're cracking up.<br> - Hey, why don't you shut up?<br> - No, no.<br> I'll admit, it's been very trying...<br> ...but I'm determined<br> to make something of myself.<br> - You don't like working with the dentist?<br> - No, I do not.<br> Well, Ginger said<br> you're not used to working a job.<br> Well, in that respect,<br> I was very fortunate.<br> He was a handsome guy with money.<br> He was smooth talker and pampered her.<br> What's she gonna say, no?<br> I got it.<br> Why does it have to be a decorator?<br> Why can't you pick something else?<br> What would you want me to do?<br> Do you want me to wait tables?<br> Bag groceries?<br> Hey, Ginger bags groceries.<br> Well, Ginger and I<br> are completely different people.<br> Yeah, she got the good genes.<br> It's not genetic. You can't always<br> blame everything on your genes.<br> If you're prepared to work hard<br> and not settle-<br> - What, you mean Augie?<br> - She means me.<br> Who do I have to sleep with around here<br> to get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?<br> That's what I...<br> What-? What-?<br> Oh, Christ, I can't remember.<br> So, Chili was telling me that you used<br> to have a really nice collection of cars.<br> Oh, yes, my husband did.<br> He used to collect vintage<br> Bentleys and Mercedes.<br> - Wow, those are expensive cars.<br> - Yes, they are.<br> You know, having wealth<br> is nothing to be ashamed of.<br> - We were very civic-minded.<br> - Yeah, with other people's money.<br> This guy lost every penny<br> of Ginger's money.<br> I tried to bring my sister<br> and her husband in on a good thing.<br> I mean, what do I know<br> about financial schemes?<br> You'll be very happy to know<br> that I lost every cent of my own money.<br> You know, every home,<br> every stick of furniture...<br> ...every fur, every ring<br> and every bank account...<br> ...and still it wasn't enough<br> to placate the government.<br> Her husband was a slick operator.<br> I was there a week...<br> - ... I knew he was hitting on her<br> girlfriend. - I really need to study.<br> - I need some peace, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> I'm not gonna make it<br> if you turn this place into a nightclub.<br> - I can't. I just can't.<br> - All right, all right, all right.<br> - Everybody out. The girl's got homework.<br> - What? Main event's not on yet.<br> - Out.<br> - I'm not leaving now.<br> You know, she's right about you, Chili.<br> - You drink, you become a jerk.<br> - What about her? She's drink-<br> Jerk? Come here.<br> I'm sorry I don't drive a Bentley.<br> - Let's go to the bar.<br> - Bye, guys. Thank you for coming.<br> Good night.<br> - Jesus, it's a mess.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Ginger, I'm really- I don't-<br> I don't know what came over me.<br> But I have told you before, your taste<br> in men leaves a lot to be desired.<br> Yeah, I know these are not<br> your kind of guys.<br> I mean, God, don't you wanna meet<br> some decent man?<br> You know, someone<br> who can take you out of this-<br> What? This hole?<br> Yeah, I know what you think of it here.<br> I mean, you've got two kids.<br> You can do better than Chili<br> and his drunken loser friends.<br> If I thought I could do better, I would.<br> So far no one's beating my door down.<br> You know, he's sexy<br> and he doesn't steal.<br> Okay, okay. Do you always have to make<br> those stupid sarcastic digs?<br> I'm scared, Hal.<br> Paula said the reason Howard<br> is leaving Global Innovations...<br> ...is he's not comfortable with business<br> practices from a legal standpoint.<br> - Howard Trask is such a pussy.<br> - No, no-<br> - What do you think I have lawyers for?<br> - He didn't wanna wind up in jail.<br> Jail? Jesus.<br> Isn't that a bit dramatic?<br> If I back out now, I hate to tell you<br> how much money we'd lose.<br> It's like a domino effect.<br> One thing would follow the other.<br> Hey, let me deal with it, okay?<br> Is there anything you want<br> that you don't have?<br> Is there?<br> No.<br> So stop worrying and let me spoil you.<br> No, I agree. I mean,<br> Howard always was a prissy mama's boy.<br> Yeah, mama's boy.<br> That's the perfect phrase.<br> Okay, how about Tuesday<br> the 22nd at 9?<br> I can't make 9.<br> How about the afternoon?<br> All right, 2, 3?<br> I can't make the 22nd.<br> How about the 21 st?<br> - We have nothing open on the 21 st.<br> - Good night.<br> Well, he wants me in a week.<br> Well, another day or two won't matter.<br> How about the 24th?<br> - Fine. Oh, wait, no.<br> - Go for 9?<br> That's my colonoscopy prep day.<br> That's always very special.<br> Why don't you think about it<br> and call me?<br> Before you go,<br> can you call Dr. Girsback...<br> ...and tell him I read the x-rays<br> and we can talk later?<br> - Sure.<br> - No, no, no.<br> When you're done, when you're done.<br> When you're finished. Thank you.<br> Are you feeling more comfortable<br> in the job?<br> I hope you're pleased,<br> because I am determined to make it work.<br> - It fits in perfectly with my class.<br> - Are you getting better on the computer?<br> Well, I'm sure I'm the worst student there,<br> but another girl helps me, so...<br> I'm glad you're relaxing more<br> into this job.<br> - I'm trying.<br> - I must say, I like having you around.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Since you started working here...<br> ...have you noticed I've been wearing<br> more colorful neckties?<br> - I-<br> - Since you- I'm just- Just joking.<br> Can I-? Can I make a confession?<br> I don't know that I should be the one<br> to hear a confession, doctor.<br> Well...<br> The way you dress...<br> ...I sometimes find very...<br> ...arousing.<br> Really? I don't think I dress<br> in the slightest provocatively.<br> Does it upset you if I tell you<br> that I find you attractive?<br> Dr. Flicker, where is<br> all this talk leading?<br> Well, I'm not<br> the kind of person...<br> ...who likes to beat around the bush.<br> I find you a very alluring woman.<br> I'm flattered, but I certainly hope<br> that's not why you hired me.<br> A certain elegance in a woman<br> has always been enticing to me.<br> - I shouldn't be hearing this.<br> - No, don't be upset.<br> - I'm not upset. Can I just grab my coat?<br> - Don't be upset.<br> Really, I think if you get to know me,<br> you'd come out of your shell more.<br> I'm not in a shell.<br> - Ever gotten high on nitrous oxide?<br> - No.<br> - It would remove your inhibitions.<br> - I don't have inhibitions.<br> - Stop.<br> - Dr. Flicker.<br> - Stop being standoffish.<br> - I'm not standoffish.<br> You should be proud.<br> You've made a conquest.<br> Oh, Dr. Flicker.<br> This is so embarrassing.<br> I am never coming back here.<br> I don't have to put myself<br> through this nonsense.<br> I gotta take a deep breath.<br> Oh, now look what you've done.<br> I can't breathe.<br> Oh, God, I can't breathe.<br> I don't blame you for being shaken up.<br> I'd have that dentist reported.<br> If I told my boyfriend that story...<br> ...he would go to the guy's office<br> and break every bone in his body.<br> You can sue him. That's harassment.<br> No, I'm never going<br> into another courtroom.<br> I don't blame you.<br> My boyfriend's a lawyer.<br> He's got court stories.<br> - Sharon, do you know any men?<br> - Men?<br> Men that would be good for me.<br> I just moved here,<br> so I don't really know anybody.<br> If you can't fall in love in San Francisco,<br> you can't fall in love anywhere.<br> Someone substantial.<br> Well, what are you doing<br> Sunday afternoon?<br> Not very much.<br> Tony and I are going to a party.<br> Come with.<br> Oh, no, no. I don't think I'm ready<br> for a big crowd of strangers.<br> Oh, come on.<br> It's a big bash someone's having.<br> There'll be all kinds of people.<br> Make an effort,<br> otherwise nothing happens.<br> Then you blame<br> everything but yourself.<br> No, I want to. It's<br> not that I don't want to.<br> - Can I bring my sister?<br> - For moral support? Absolutely.<br> And Tony and I will be there.<br> You'll have fun. It's a huge party.<br> Maybe you'll get lucky.<br> But you have to come,<br> otherwise I'm not going.<br> - What the hell would I wear?<br> - Oh, we'll find you something.<br> Oh, God, I haven't shown my face<br> socially in so long.<br> Sharon said there could be<br> some eligible men there.<br> I haven't been to a party in years.<br> You know, Chili hates them.<br> - Well, you know what I say to Chili.<br> - It's hard to meet a man you can trust.<br> Hal.<br> Hey, Nat.<br> What are you doing out here?<br> I was having lunch in Southampton<br> and I wanted you to meet Amy Moore.<br> Oh, hi. Hal Francis.<br> This is my wife. Honey?<br> - Jasmine.<br> - Hello.<br> Amy will be handling your contracts for<br> Empire Solutions and Global Innovations.<br> She's brilliant.<br> We couldn't have done any better.<br> We should get together<br> on that Empire Solutions thing.<br> - Free on Tuesday?<br> - I'll make sure I am.<br> That's great.<br> Are you having an affair with Amy?<br> - Amy, my lawyer?<br> - Don't give me that. She's very pretty.<br> Of course not.<br> What makes you think that?<br> - Someone made a remark.<br> - What remark?<br> They saw you having lunch with her.<br> Taking her hand.<br> Oh, what crap. Who told you that?<br> I know who.<br> - That vacuous troublemaker Lydia, right?<br> - Were you?<br> I had a business lunch with Amy<br> at the Four Seasons.<br> - Lydia was there.<br> - Did you take her hand?<br> You think if I was having an affair,<br> I'd be crazy enough to have it in public?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Sometimes you drink at lunch.<br> Maybe you were high.<br> - It's obvious she's got crush on you.<br> - You're building a case.<br> If you were having an affair,<br> I would be pretty upset.<br> Well, I'm not,<br> so don't get your temper up.<br> I'm just jealous because I love you.<br> You should be flattered.<br> You know, I understand<br> other women have a-<br> Find you attractive,<br> but it's their hard luck. I have you.<br> - Yes, you do.<br> - No.<br> So you're not?<br> No, I'm not.<br> Good.<br> Let's make love.<br> You know, if you were having an affair,<br> I'd be pretty upset.<br> Pretty darn angry.

You are.<br> - Really? Really?<br> I'd rather be someplace else too.<br> - Do I look that uncomfortable?<br> - Almost.<br> - I'm Dwight Westlake.<br> - Jasmine French.<br> Jasmine French,<br> that's a very exotic name.<br> Well, my parents named me<br> after my mother's favorite flower.<br> Night-blooming jasmine.<br> Come to life after it gets dark.<br> That's the best offer I've had today.<br> I didn't say it was an offer.<br> I saw you in the other room before,<br> I was hoping I'd get to meet you.<br> Well, hope I don't shatter your illusion.<br> - You have great style.<br> - Do I?<br> Chanel belt, Herms bag<br> and Vivier shoes.<br> Vivier- Oh, my goodness.<br> Do you work in the fashion industry?<br> No, but my former wife was.<br> She worked at a fashion magazine.<br> - Right.<br> - She passed away last year.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - I'm so- And what do you do?<br> - Nothing as glamorous as fashion.<br> - I work in the State Department.<br> - Well, no, that's glamorous.<br> In the diplomatic corps.<br> - Don't tell me you're an ambassador.<br> - No, hardly.<br> But I wouldn't turn it down.<br> We knew the ambassador to Mexico.<br> My husband did.<br> Your husband? You have a husband?<br> No, no. Sadly, like your wife,<br> he passed away.<br> But, you know, we stayed overnight<br> in the embassy in Mexico once.<br> - I work in Europe. Vienna.<br> - Really?<br> - Oh, I love Vienna.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> We were there once, Hal and I.<br> I remember it as being two weeks<br> of young wine and chocolate cake.<br> Lovely. My ambition is to come back<br> after a few years and enter politics.<br> - I'd like to run for office in California.<br> - Oh, how exciting.<br> Yeah, it might just be an inflated ego,<br> but I think I'd make a good congressman.<br> I grew up in San Francisco.<br> I know California. I like challenges.<br> You from out here?<br> New York. Park Avenue.<br> You know, when my husband<br> passed away...<br> ...I mean, naturally I was very upset...<br> ...so I decided to come out here<br> and start a new life for myself.<br> What did he do?<br> He was a surgeon.<br> God, that must be incredibly stressful.<br> No, I mean, he had a heart attack.<br> I'm sure that's what gave it to him.<br> You have children?<br> No, no. No, there really wasn't time.<br> And what about you? What do you do?<br> I guessed you were in the arts.<br> - Am I right?<br> - Well, you're close.<br> I am an interior designer.<br> I really have hit the jackpot.<br> - Really?<br> - I meet this exotic creature...<br> ...not only is she charming<br> and elegant and single...<br> - ... but I just bought a new house.<br> - Really?<br> One I've been looking at. It's in Marin.<br> - Overlooking the Bay. My dream house.<br> - Beautiful.<br> I meet this woman, and she turns out<br> to be an interior designer.<br> Written in the stars.<br> You have to look at it.<br> - I would love to.<br> - Maybe you can help me with it.<br> Absolutely.<br> I never slept with anyone<br> the first night before, you know?<br> - Yeah, that-<br> - But dancing with you...<br> ...got me all hot and bothered,<br> so, you know...<br> Well, you were so sexy.<br> I mean, I knew right away<br> that you were gonna be good in bed.<br> - I knew it.<br> - Did you?<br> I said to myself, you know...<br> You know, I thought for sure<br> we were gonna get caught.<br> I didn't care. I mean, I-<br> I couldn't wait. There's no way I was-<br> I had to have you right then and there.<br> You know...<br> - You know what clinched it for me?<br> - What?<br> Because you were so smooth.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah. Oh, yeah.<br> - Well, that's- I just-<br> - But, you know, I-<br> I don't want you to think I'm just easy,<br> because I'm not.<br> No, I- You know what I think?<br> You're a fun-loving person.<br> - I am.<br> - That's- Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> - And that's what I am.<br> - I can see that.<br> - That's-<br> - I'm easygoing by nature.<br> - Yeah.<br> That's what I-<br> I bring music to people's lives.<br> You're very sweet, you know?<br> I never had a sweet guy before.<br> - I hope I-<br> - Never.<br> I hope I didn't get you in trouble<br> with your boyfriend.<br> No. You know, it's not like<br> we're engaged, so...<br> - You know, I'm free. I'm free.<br> - I'm glad to hear that.<br> Oh, God, I'd better get back.<br> My lunch hour's almost over.<br> But we- You know what?<br> We have time, though.<br> - For what?<br> - Let's go in the back seat.<br> - Again?<br> - Yeah, come on.<br> - Jesus, what are you?<br> - It's just...<br> - Are you one of those sex addicts?<br> - I am for you. Come on.<br> - Are you? I thought so.<br> - One more.<br> Nobody's around. Not many people.<br> - We gotta make this quick.<br> - I got tinted windows. It's perfect.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Seven thirty.<br> - My turn. It's my turn!<br> - God, he told me he'd call me yesterday.<br> I wanna play with it!<br> Can't you two stop fighting<br> for a second?<br> - I've got a throbbing headache.<br> - You gave him both here...<br> - ... and your cell number?<br> - Of course I gave him both numbers.<br> Unless he's been delayed<br> in Washington.<br> - Still, he could have phoned.<br> - Don't think he figured you were lying...<br> - ... and bailed out?<br> - Look, could you stop saying I was lying?<br> God. Okay, I may have dressed up a few<br> facts, omitted a few unpleasant details...<br> ...but in the main, I mean,<br> my feelings, my ideas, my humor-<br> I mean, isn't that who I am? Christ.<br> People reinvent themselves, don't they?<br> Do I have your permission?<br> You better take more of those pills.<br> You're shot.<br> Oh, Jesus. Would you please-?<br> Matthew, turn off that pounding.<br> Please, Matthew.<br> Can't stand it.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - Were you at a party Sunday afternoon?<br> - Who says?<br> I got a friend who's a bartender.<br> He saw you at a party.<br> - So?<br> - So you were dancing with a guy.<br> - So what?<br> - I asked her to come with me, okay?<br> I was nervous about going to a party<br> where I didn't know anyone.<br> Is that so? So the two of you<br> were in the corner...<br> - ... playing kissy-face.<br> - Give me a break.<br> We couldn't go to the ballpark<br> because you weren't feeling good.<br> Hey, don't treat me like property.<br> I had a headache when you called.<br> And then I decided<br> to keep my sister company at a party.<br> I don't buy that.<br> Since when am I taking orders<br> from you?<br> Can you please not fight in here?<br> I don't think I can take it. For some<br> reason, my Xanax isn't kicking in.<br> Who's this guy<br> you're fooling around with?<br> I told you, I didn't like you rushing me<br> into anything, okay?<br> - Is seeing other guys her idea?<br> - No, it's my idea.<br> I don't think it is. She thinks I'm a bum<br> like your first husband, right?<br> - You told me.<br> - Guys, give me a break.<br> - By all rights, I should be living here.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Didn't you want a guy here<br> for the kids?<br> - So they grow up with a father?<br> - I need to clear my head.<br> We're talking about getting married.<br> Now she's taking you to parties...<br> ...and telling you<br> I'm not good enough for you.<br> - If I catch you...<br> - Give her some space.<br> - ... with somebody else-<br> - Get out!<br> You keep out of this, okay?<br> It's got nothing to do with you.<br> You beat it, Chili. You've been drinking.<br> Hey, maybe that's for you.<br> Ginger, she's not somebody<br> you can count on. I am.<br> Don't pick it up. I don't want him to think<br> I'm waiting for him to call.<br> - What the hell's going on?<br> - It's Al.<br> - Hey, give me that.<br> - That's the guy, Al.<br> - Hi. Yeah, but you're calling<br> at a- Get off! - Give me that.<br> You call here again, I'm gonna bust you<br> in your fat fucking face!<br> - Hello. No! No!<br> - Give me that. Give me that.<br> Look what you did,<br> you drunken asshole!<br> You were right,<br> he's no better than Augie!<br> - Don't drag her to parties to meet men.<br> - Get out!<br> I didn't drag her out to meet men,<br> but if she has a brain...<br> ...she'll dump you in the garbage<br> and find someone she deserves for once.<br> - When are you moving out?<br> - Get out!<br> I'm sorry I don't come from Park Avenue,<br> but I don't steal people's money.<br> - I am not some lying jailbird.<br> - Get out or I'll call the cops, okay?<br> She doesn't care about you.<br> She's a phony.<br> - She didn't care about you...<br> - Get out!<br> - ... until she fucking needed you!<br> - Get out!<br> - That's my cell phone.<br> - Okay.<br> Where is it?<br> Oh, God, the kids were playing with it.<br> Oh, where is my goddamned<br> cell phone?<br> Hello? Dwight?<br> Yes, can you just hang on a moment?<br> I'm just in the middle of something.<br> Hello, how are you?<br> No, no, no, it's just some business<br> I had to attend to.<br> Oh, no, no. No, that's fine.<br> I know how hectic things can get<br> in the nation's capital.<br> When?<br> Well, I'm actually<br> meeting a client...<br> for a drink in the Fairmont...<br> ...so why don't you pick me up<br> in the lounge?<br> Great.<br> No, no, no, 3 is perfect.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> - I'd like to make this wall a little<br> higher. - Oh, well, it's lovely.<br> I knew you'd like it.<br> Oh, and the garden is so established.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - Yeah, it's all right.<br> The porch is so charming.<br> I can see why you love it.<br> - I have to get someone to take care of it.<br> - The orchids, oh.<br> Oh, this...<br> - This is spectacular.<br> - Right?<br> - I think it's incredibly cheerful.<br> - Oh, look at the flow, and the light.<br> - I mean, it-<br> - It goes a ways that way as well.<br> - I have a million ideas immediately.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Oh, the fireplace. Reminds me<br> of those places in the Hamptons.<br> - So delightful.<br> - You've done work in the Hamptons?<br> - We have friends out there.<br> - Yes.<br> - All right.<br> - Yes, I've done a number of...<br> ...beach houses.<br> Let me show you the view.<br> Well, I can see-<br> - Oh, my God, it's enormous.<br> - Right?<br> I had no i- You could have<br> - I don't have that many friends, but sure.<br> - Look at-<br> The view, it's just breathtaking.<br> Andrea and I used to do<br> a lot of entertaining.<br> I bet you did, living in New York.<br> Well, now you're talking<br> about my specialty.<br> You know, I gave the best<br> dinner parties in the city.<br> Come here.<br> I'm shocked.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> What's your reaction, really?<br> Well, my reaction is...<br> - ... you can do it again if you like.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> I've always wanted a canopy bed.<br> Look at this.<br> - Yeah, that looks interesting.<br> - It is, right?<br> Is that mid-19th century?<br> - I have no idea.<br> - Yeah. Well, no, all the pieces are here.<br> I do- I love the posts,<br> but these beds, they're just-<br> Well, they're not very wide.<br> - Oh, yeah? Well, we're not very wide.<br> - Oh, Dwight.<br> We could do the top<br> in a muslin or linen-<br> - Yeah, yeah, whatever you think.<br> - Well, it's not-<br> You know, last night<br> when we were making love...<br> ...I realized how removed<br> from the world...<br> - ... I've been since Andrea died.<br> - I know, I know. I...<br> I think when something's right,<br> you just...<br> - You know it immediately.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Do you-? Do you hear that?<br> - Can you hear the bass, though?<br> - Yeah.<br> Like, the bass<br> and then the high-end definition.<br> I'm definitely gonna get one. Yup.<br> - I'm giving you this one.<br> - No, you're not.<br> - Yeah, I am.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Come here.<br> - You're so sweet.<br> - You're sweet.<br> - You're sweet.<br> - You wanna dance?<br> - Yeah.<br> Isn't this dancing?<br> Yeah, this is slow dancing,<br> which is really...<br> - What?<br> - Well, it's the key, I always say...<br> ...to good lovemaking.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where do you think Mom is tonight?<br> - Oh, she's got a date tonight.<br> - Oh, that's cool.<br> - I wonder where she is.<br> Well, I don't think<br> she's at Chuck E. Cheese.<br> I'm gonna babysit you.<br> I'm a good babysitter.<br> - Yeah.<br> - You know?<br> You should babysit.<br> I used to babysit when I was a teenager.<br> It's how you make extra money.<br> Mom said you never did any work,<br> because you were so rich.<br> Well, I didn't know<br> what I wanted to become.<br> And Hal, my husband,<br> he swept me off my feet.<br> "Blue Moon" was the song that was<br> playing. You know the song "Blue Moon. "<br> Yeah, but I always wanted<br> to do something with my life.<br> You know, I had energy.<br> I didn't just shop and lunch<br> and go to matinees.<br> You know, I ran charities<br> for poor people...<br> ...and, you know, raised some money<br> for museums and schools.<br> You know, with wealth<br> comes responsibilities.<br> I wasn't just some mindless consumer<br> like so many of my so-called friends.<br> Though I won't say<br> I dislike buying pretty clothes.<br> Tip big, boys.<br> Tip big, because you get good service<br> and they count on tips.<br> You know, someday<br> when you come into great wealth...<br> ...you must remember to be generous.<br> Mom said you used to be okay,<br> but you got crazy.<br> Yeah, and then you talked to yourself.<br> Well, there's only so many traumas<br> a person can withstand...<br> ...until they take to the streets<br> and start screaming.<br> That's right, boys, they picked me up<br> on the street talking to myself...<br> ...and gave me something<br> called Edison's Medicine.<br> Why Edison?<br> Because they use electricity<br> to get you thinking straight.<br> See, everything unraveled so quickly.<br> You know, I started experiencing<br> anxiety and claustrophobia...<br> ...and this acute fear of death.<br> You know, I had nightmares<br> and a nervous breakdown.<br> I mean, you must have heard<br> of Prozac and lithium.<br> Well, all those drugs<br> just made me worse.<br> Of course, you know,<br> I probably did suspect...<br> ...that not everything Hal did<br> was always 100-percent aboveboard.<br> Christ, I mean,<br> you'd have to be an idiot...<br> ...not to think his phenomenal success<br> was too good to be true.<br> But a cheat is a cheat.<br> And when he had other women,<br> I just flipped out.<br> You know, and one thing led<br> to another and...<br> But that's all history, boys.<br> I met someone. I'm a new person.<br> - Get everything?<br> - Yes. These in the kitchen?<br> - Sure.<br> - I can't believe how much you paid for it.<br> I know it's ridiculous and it's old.<br> God knows if it even works.<br> - We have the terrace for a telescope.<br> - Watch the stars over San Francisco Bay.<br> And the moon will look incredible<br> through it.<br> - Ever seen the moon through that?<br> - Oh, I can imagine.<br> Hey, can I ask you something?<br> - Sure.<br> - You ever think...<br> ...you could see yourself<br> married to me?<br> Married?<br> I have it all planned, but obviously<br> you can say no if it sounds terrible.<br> All right? But you come with me<br> next month to Vienna.<br> We live there for a few years<br> and I can teach you to waltz.<br> And you can have all the chocolate cake<br> and wine you want.<br> And then we come back and I get serious<br> about my political dream.<br> And then we adopt kids<br> and we live in the house...<br> ...that you're gonna do<br> such a fantastic job making beautiful.<br> What do you think? Downside for you<br> is you have to stand next to me...<br> ...and smile at photo ops when<br> I throw my hat in the ring.<br> - So you're saying you love me.<br> - Can't you tell?<br> I hope I didn't cause you to become ill<br> over the prospect of being my wife.<br> You know, sometimes I get<br> these headaches.<br> You always take Xanax<br> for a headache?<br> I'll admit, my heart's<br> beating a little fast.<br> Yeah, your hands are shaking.<br> I wanted you to want me<br> and now you do.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Have a nice day. You got it?<br> Okay, I'll take that.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - You know why I'm here.<br> - I told you not to bother me.<br> - You're sleeping with Al.<br> You're not gonna make a fool<br> out of me.<br> Chili, this is not the place<br> to discuss this, okay?<br> - Sir, is there a problem?<br> - Sorry.<br> No, there's no problem.<br> - Ginger, Ginger, I love you.<br> - Ginger, what's going on?<br> - What happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> No, I just need a- Just need a break<br> from everything to think.<br> - All right, look, I blame this on Jasmine.<br> - No, she's just looking out for me.<br> Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, okay?<br> I don't like her.<br> You meant nothing to her<br> until she needed you.<br> - I'm working, Chili.<br> - I'm nuts about you, Ging.<br> I'm nuts about you. We're gonna do<br> all these things together, big things.<br> What great things, huh?<br> You're a grease monkey.<br> - And I'll be bagging groceries all my life.<br> - She"s cuckoo, baby. She talks to herself.<br> - You told me that yourself.<br> - I need space.<br> Just give me some space, okay?<br> I can't sleep.<br> - I'm a nervous wreck.<br> - Oh, for chrissake.<br> I can't get you off of my head.<br> Stop it. Will you stop crying?<br> There's people around.<br> I don't know what<br> I'm gonna do without you.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - I don't.<br> - Stop it. Stop it, please.<br> - I got this, okay?<br> - Would you like to sit in my office?<br> - No. But I appreciate it.<br> Look, who's this guy, Al?<br> - What does he do?<br> - You know what he doesn't do?<br> He doesn't make scenes<br> where I work in public.<br> Come on, brother.<br> Would you like a Kleenex?<br> - I love her so much.<br> - It's okay. There's nothing to see, okay?<br> Great.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi.<br> You seem up.<br> He's taking me to pick out<br> an engagement ring tomorrow.<br> - How great.<br> - What's that smell?<br> Did you break a bottle of perfume?<br> Al doesn't call it perfume,<br> he calls it a fragrance.<br> That's sweet. But if I may say...<br> ...you may have doused yourself<br> a little over-abundantly with it.<br> God, I'm always nervous<br> it will wear off.<br> He's taking me to his favorite jeweler.<br> You think Al is a step up from Chili?<br> Anybody is a step up from Chili.<br> He's such a gentleman.<br> Well, then he's definitely a step up.<br> But in bed, he's no gentleman.<br> Wait till he takes a whiff<br> of my new fragrance.<br> It's French.<br> Yeah, I'm on my way.<br> Yeah, I'm on my way over right now.<br> - You're late.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - I'm still shaking.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I think Hal is having an affair.<br> With Lisette Boudreau?<br> Who is she?<br> That French girl. The Jordans' au pair.<br> What do you know about this?<br> You're the only one who doesn't know.<br> I've known about Hal's affairs for years,<br> but it's not my business.<br> How did you find out?<br> The Ritz Hotel in Paris called.<br> Hal left his Rolex there.<br> But he told me that he was going<br> on a business trip to Chicago.<br> If he'd said Paris,<br> I would've gone along...<br> ...and I didn't know what they were talking<br> about, so I did some checking and...<br> I knew this day would come.<br> I'm surprised it took so long.<br> Who else?<br> Victoria Alter.<br> Raylene.<br> This au pair.<br> That trainer he used to take<br> to baseball games.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - You know how many people...<br> ...have said to me he's doing his lawyer,<br> the Chinese dragon lady?<br> - Can we get the waiter? I need a drink.<br> - Yes. Waiter.<br> - Yes, ma'am?<br> - This again.<br> - Right away. Thank you.<br> - Absolutely.<br> Hello?<br> Yeah, is Al there?<br> Al Munsinger, yeah.<br> I know he works<br> in the Audio Department, yeah.<br> Yeah, I'll hold.<br> Hello?<br> Al Munsinger, yes.<br> Al, where the hell are you?<br> What?<br> What? I don't get it.<br> Why couldn't you come?<br> Who found out what?<br> Who's Ellen?<br> Yeah, I-<br> I didn't understand you had a wife.<br> No.<br> No, you never said.<br> My mother was very impressed<br> with you.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah. You two had a discussion...<br> - ... about her collection of pewter.<br> - Yes. I love pewter.<br> Hal used to have his beer<br> out of a pewter mug.<br> And your dad?<br> My dad can be very critical sometimes,<br> but he was very taken with you.<br> Well, don't worry,<br> I won't pick out too big a stone.<br> Yeah, nothing larger<br> than the Hope diamond.<br> Hey, Jasmine.<br> What? You don't remember me?<br> Of course I remember you.<br> What a surprise.<br> Yeah, surprise, surprise, huh?<br> This is Augie. Dwight.<br> - Dwight, hi.<br> - How you doing?<br> I was married to her sister.<br> - Okay.<br> - Years ago. Years.<br> Wasn't that many years.<br> She makes it sound ancient.<br> Congratulations. Ginger said<br> you got a new job up in Alaska.<br> I could've had my own company<br> if it wasn't for you...<br> - ... and that crook you married.<br> - I don't think it's the time and place.<br> Oh, really? You think I wanna lay oil pipe<br> way the hell up there in Alaska?<br> I got no money.<br> Christ, can't you put this behind you<br> and move on? I've moved on.<br> - Take it easy. I don't know who you are-<br> - Right, you don't, so stay out of it.<br> I saw your son.<br> Yeah, that's right, Danny.<br> Remember him?<br> Lives across the bridge in Oakland,<br> works at a music store. Antonio's.<br> He's doing pretty good. He's married.<br> I think he's finally over Hal's suicide.<br> Danny's in Oakland?<br> Let me tell you something,<br> Jeanette, Jasmine...<br> ...whatever it is<br> you call yourself these days.<br> Some people...<br> ...they don't put things behind<br> so easily.<br> You have a son?<br> Yes, I have a son. He's not- Biologically<br> he's not my son. He's my step-<br> - Hal's suicide?<br> - I can explain it all later.<br> - Can we just-?<br> - Not until you tell me what's going on.<br> - Not in the street.<br> - I want to know.<br> - I know. We'll go somewhere quiet.<br> - Get in the car.<br> - Don't talk to me in that tone of voice.<br> - Okay.<br> Of course we can't get married!<br> You lied to me up and down the line!<br> - No, I wanted to tell you.<br> - Are you delusional?<br> Didn't you think I'd find out?<br> - What were you thinking?<br> - I don't know what I was thinking.<br> Everything happened in the past.<br> You and I loved each other.<br> What? That it would just vanish?<br> Didn't you think I would find out,<br> if not today, eventually?<br> Like after we were married? Is that what<br> you wanted, to wait until it was too late?<br> For your future plans<br> where you needed the appropriate wife?<br> I won't say it wouldn't be an issue,<br> but that you could stand by...<br> - ... deceive me until I married you-<br> - No, you mean till I trapped you.<br> - Your ethical behavior is equal to your ex.<br> - I wasn't deceiving you. I loved you.<br> - I found out by chance, by sheer chance.<br> - Okay, if it's over, it's over.<br> I get it. You're not marrying me.<br> I brought everything on myself.<br> I've only got myself to blame.<br> I did it to myself again, as usual.<br> You and your stupid<br> little French whore.<br> - I have no idea what you're talking about.<br> - Let me out of the car.<br> - Let me out of the car.<br> - How are you gonna get home?<br> I'm not going home. Let me out.<br> Let me out of the car!<br> Hey, remember to tell her<br> when she gets here, okay?<br> Believe me, she won't care.<br> - She is half out the door.<br> - Yeah, well...<br> I didn't start out not liking her.<br> I think she had it in for me<br> from the moment she met me.<br> Well, I like you.<br> Now, that's what counts,<br> not how she feels about you.<br> You know, I'm sick of her<br> calling you a loser...<br> ...or always pushing me<br> to find a better man.<br> You know, in my book, you're no loser.<br> You're twice the guy I met at the party<br> she dragged me to.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, I love you.<br> - I know.<br> - I love the boys. I think they love me too.<br> - They do.<br> - When I thought I lost you-<br> - You didn't lose me, baby.<br> I almost lost you.<br> Is this what you gave up<br> everything for?<br> To sell secondhand<br> musical instruments?<br> I asked Augie not to tell you<br> where I was.<br> Why?<br> What happened?<br> Why did you disappear like that<br> and never contact me?<br> I couldn't find you when I needed you.<br> I know the whole story, I found it out,<br> so don't act so surprised.<br> Are you having an affair<br> with Lisette Boudreau?<br> Oh, Jasmine,<br> I can't do this without a drink.<br> No, don't tap dance.<br> You never went to Chicago.<br> You took the Jordans' au pair<br> to Paris.<br> I know what's been going on.<br> - Can we talk about this, please?<br> - You bet we can talk about it.<br> Can you do it calmly?<br> I wanna talk to you about<br> what's going on, but you're always so-<br> How do you expect me to react?<br> You've been sleeping<br> with other women for years.<br> I mean, Raylene,<br> your secretary, our trainer.<br> - Amy.<br> - This is different.<br> This is serious.<br> Lisette and I are in love.<br> Wha-? What?<br> Are you crazy?<br> I'm sorry, but I need you to hear<br> what I'm saying. Lisette and I are in love.<br> What does that mean?<br> What does that stupidity even mean?<br> It means that we are making plans<br> for the future together.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm having trouble understanding.<br> I know this comes as a shock,<br> but I have to be honest with you.<br> You wanna be honest.<br> That's the biggest joke of all.<br> I've had casual flirtations in the past.<br> They didn't mean anything until now.<br> This is different.<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> She is a teenager, for chrissake.<br> She's an au pair.<br> I mean, are you crazy?<br> - Christ, this is hard for me to tell you!<br> - It's hard for you? What about me?<br> This is so humiliating for me.<br> I mean, it is bad enough that<br> everyone knows you've been unfaithful.<br> But to throw me away for this<br> stupid-looking little French-<br> - I will take very good care of you.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I can't breathe. I can't breathe.<br> I don't know what I'm-<br> What am I doing here?<br> Oh, God, this is unacceptable.<br> This is not gonna happen.<br> You're not going anywhere.<br> This is unacceptable.<br> - Jasmine, you're having a tantrum.<br> - Don't you touch me!<br> - Don't you touch me!<br> - You are having a tantrum.<br> Stop, stop.<br> - What am I doing here?<br> - Pull yourself together.<br> - I can't-<br> - Jasmine.<br> When you calm down, we can talk<br> like two civilized adults...<br> ...about the arrangements<br> we have to make.<br> Until then I'm gonna check into a hotel.<br> What am I doing here?<br> What am I doing here?<br> Hello.<br> Yes, I want the number of the FBl.<br> Can you connect me?<br> The FBl.<br> - Mr. Francis?<br> - Yes?<br> - Hal Francis?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> we have a warrant for your arrest.<br> - What?<br> - We have a warrant for your arrest.<br> - Is this some kind of a joke?<br> - No, sir.<br> - It's best if you come with us now.<br> - Under arrest for what?<br> Sir, come with us now.<br> We'll settle this downtown.<br> - Do you have a warrant?<br> - I do.<br> - Gonna handcuff me?<br> - We are.<br> - I wanna talk to my lawyer.<br> - You'll be able to call your lawyer.<br> But we'll warn you,<br> you have the right to remain silent.<br> Anything you say can be held<br> against you in court.<br> - Okay, okay, let's go.<br> - Let's go.<br> Jesus Christ Almighty.<br> - What am I being arrested for?<br> - We can discuss this downtown, sir.<br> As disillusioned as I was with him,<br> I hated you more.<br> The moment I did what I did,<br> I regretted it.<br> I don't wanna discuss it.<br> It's past. It's over.<br> You can't take back that phone call.<br> I need you, Danny.<br> I don't wanna see you, Jasmine.<br> I want the past past.<br> I've become a different person,<br> thanks to my wife. I'm off drugs.<br> Just, please, don't spoil everything.<br> Just get out of my life<br> so I can move on.<br> Definitely.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Hey, have some champagne.<br> Chili brought some over to celebrate.<br> We're back together.<br> I'm sorry,<br> I'm not in a celebratory mood.<br> I don't think I'd find that news<br> anything to celebrate about.<br> Hey, come on, Jasmine,<br> let's not dig at each other, okay?<br> I'm moving in, and she tells me<br> you found a rich husband.<br> - Gonna be a big shot in Washington.<br> - We made up.<br> - Yeah, she begged for my forgiveness.<br> - And he cried like a baby and apologized.<br> - I didn't cry.<br> - Bullshit. You cry all the time.<br> But we're moving in.<br> It's something we planned for a long time<br> and maybe if we'd just done it-<br> Oh, for chrissake.<br> What's wrong with your self-esteem?<br> There's men who'd never think<br> about ripping the phone out of the wall.<br> Hey, leave him alone.<br> You're always picking on him.<br> No, you choose losers, okay?<br> Because that's what you think<br> you deserve.<br> That's why you're living like this and<br> that's why you'll never have a better life.<br> I'm- I'm living-<br> I'm living like this because<br> you married the biggest loser of all...<br> ...and went your own sweet way...<br> ...while he pissed away my<br> one big chance to make a better life.<br> Come on, let's not ruin<br> our celebration, okay?<br> Come on, she's happy, we're happy.<br> Let's let sleeping dogs lie.<br> He's right. I'm not gonna be drawn<br> into defending myself...<br> ...when all I wanted to do<br> was bring you in on a good deal.<br> I'm moving out of this place today.<br> I just gotta get myself together.<br> Dwight asked me to move in with him,<br> as I expected he would.<br> He wants me to finish<br> decorating his home.<br> Then we'll marry<br> and we'll move in together.<br> He's one of these men<br> who's lost without a woman.<br> It has to be the right woman,<br> who's a plus for his career.<br> And I have the social skills required<br> for his future in politics.<br> For the next few years,<br> we'll be living in Vienna.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me,<br> I'm gonna take a shower.<br> I'll send for my luggage.<br> I was pretty angry at some of the things<br> she said, but I kept it on the inside.<br> I'm tired of her knocking you.<br> You know?<br> Don't even think about taking<br> that last slice of pizza.<br> - What? Why?<br> - That's my slice of pizza. Don't take it.<br> - Is it really?<br> - Last slice belongs to the man.<br> - You're putting too much on the hips.<br> - Is that so?<br> - Yeah, if you wanna keep me around-<br> - This slice is yours?<br> - Don't touch it. Ginger, I swear to God.<br> - Is this yours? Is this yours?<br> That slice of pizza is mine.<br> - That's mine.<br> - Yeah.<br> That's mine. That's mine.<br> Oh, that's mine.<br> Those are definitely mine.<br> Is that yours? Yeah?<br> Yeah, that's yours, okay.<br> It's fraught with peril.<br> They gossip, you know, they talk.<br> I saw Danny.<br> Yes, did I tell you?<br> He's getting married.<br> A weekend in Palm Beach<br> means I can wear...<br> What could I wear? I can wear<br> the Dior dress I bought in Paris.<br> Yes, my black dress.<br> Well, Hal always used to surprise me<br> with jewelry.<br> Extravagant pieces.<br> I think he used to buy them at auction.<br> It's so obvious what you're doing.<br> You think I don't know.<br> French au pair.<br> This was playing on the Vineyard.<br> "Blue Moon. "<br> I used to know the words.<br> I knew the words.<br> Now they're all a jumble.<br> Sync, fix: titler<br>
