It'll be<br> noted, along with all the other incidents.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Don't make any waves. I don't like them.<br> Very good, sir.<br> The guest officers<br> from NATO are visiting, sir.<br> Caro! Caro!<br> Hello, baby.<br> Oh!<br> This is Yves.

Au revoir!<br> Ciao!<br> Why you want to spoil my party?<br> You went too far today. Half the people<br> on this base saw you at the beach.<br> Oh, Jesus Christ! Brigitte Bardot<br> strips for millions, she's a goddess.<br> - I sunbathe topless, and I'm a scandal.<br> - You're not Brigitte Bardot, remember?<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't make you happy?<br> Have a drink, you'll feel better.<br> Feel better if I didn't have<br> to worry about you screwin' around.<br> I've been good for two years.<br> That's not what it seemed like<br> this afternoon.<br> I've got a severe radiation leak on site.<br> The Colonel is looking for<br> any excuse to discredit me.<br> Ooh!<br> I sure gave him<br> two good ones today, didn't I?<br> Well, yes, you did.<br> - Where are the children?<br> - At the cinema, mi amore.<br> Well, pack up your old kitbag, pal.<br> You're Alabamy bound.<br> Don't worry about it.

You always do.<br> As soon as we get there, we'll go lookin'<br> for the most beautiful Southern belle doll.<br> Maybe we'll find a Scarlett O'Hara.<br> - She's too old for dolls.<br> - I am not.<br> Not everybody spends every<br> waking minute buried in a book.<br> It's good to read.<br> Alex might just wind up a...<br> famous writer like Aunt Gail.<br> She's not famous. She writes<br> obituaries for her church bulletin.<br> I got a good feeling<br> about Fort Matthews.<br> I think we're going<br> to be very happy here.<br> # Cos I'm goin' to Alabama<br> with a banjo on my knee<br> I don't think I got the words right.<br> # Camptown ladies sing this song<br> # Doo-dah, doo-dah<br> # Camptown racetrack's five miles long<br> # Oh, doo-dah day<br> # Gwine to run all night... night<br> # Gwine to run all day<br> # Bet my money on a bobtailed nag<br> - Come on, girls.<br> - # All the doo-dah day<br> No, it's not "All the doo-dah day".<br> It's "Somebody bet on the bay".<br> # Gwine to run all night<br> # Gwine to run all day<br> # Bet my money on a bobtailed nag<br> # Somebody bet on the bay<br> Come on, girls.<br> # Oh, I wished I was in the land of cotton<br> # Old times there are not forgotten<br> # Look away!

What are we gonna do?<br> Mom, why don't you<br> help us make the beds?<br> No. You girls do it, OK?<br> You make the beds.<br> - First dibs on beds.<br> - It's yours.<br> Look at this, Hank. Look at this.<br> It's all clawed to bits.<br> People live like animals and leave their<br> shit for everybody else to take care of!<br> Carly, you're tired. You're exhausted.<br> Why don't you lie down?<br> It's starting again.<br> I'm not gonna live here, Hank!<br> I hate this place!<br> Cut it out! You're a big girl!<br> This is not the end of the world!<br> No, it's just the same goddamn world that<br> we had in Washington, only it's worse!<br> Look. Everything that was<br> on the right is on the left.<br> Right and left and right<br> and left and right and left!<br> Only it's worse,<br> cos we're all ten years older!<br> These rooms are smaller!<br> Ohh!<br> Move this thing outta here, Hank!<br> I want you to move this outta here!<br> Move this out of here!<br> Move this out of here!<br> Carly, it's OK.

Don't you touch me.<br> I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.<br> I can see it!<br> I can see that radiation<br> that's comin' off you!<br> No. No! You get your goddamn<br> contaminated hands off me!<br> Carly.<br> Do you trust me?<br> Do you think I know you?<br> Do you? Hm?<br> Well, listen to me, then.<br> You have nothing to be afraid of.<br> Do you want to go home?<br> Hm?<br> So come on.<br> Let's go home.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> The car!<br> Is she OK?<br> - What happened?<br> - Mom's fine. She's... tired.<br> She needs a little rest, that's all.<br> - Do you still love me, Daddy?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> - Do you still love me?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Oh.<br> - Do you love me?<br> - Yes.<br> She's got to see somebody.<br> You can't keep playing baby-sitter.<br> Your mom is fine. She's spirited.<br> Sometimes she wears herself out<br> with all the travelling and moving.<br> I can handle her.<br> We can all handle each others' problems.<br> We didn't move just because<br> of the project you're working on.<br> You don't know what proiect I'm working<br> on. You don't know a thing about it.<br> Maybe you and Mom<br> wanna live in your own little world<br> of make-believe and secrets, but we don't.<br> Her famous Aunt Gail<br> we're always hearing about...<br> Alex!<br> Well, you heard Mom yesterday.<br> The most popular girl in Richmond?<br> She grew up on a chicken farm<br> outside of Norfolk. She needs help.<br> She needs help arranging the furniture<br> and unpacking, Miss Freud.<br> Sit down there.<br> The perfect pancake.<br> Perfect.<br> Mine.<br> I know it's hard on you,<br> but your mother loves you.<br> And I know you love her.<br> Through all the ups and... downs,<br> I've realised that what we call love is<br> really the exchange of energy over time.<br> It's simple quantum mechanics.<br> You take water, for example.<br> Sometimes it's water. Sometimes it's ice.<br> Sometimes it's steam or vapour.<br> It's always the same old H20.<br> It only changes its properties.<br> Your mother's like that.<br> She's like water.<br> I made a decision a long time ago<br> just to love her basic properties.<br> Little did I realise I'd gone<br> nuclear fission in that water.<br> Get it?<br> Get it?<br> I made a pun.<br> "I went nuclear fission. " It's a pun.<br> You're a riot, Dad.<br> And we both know<br> a lot more about love now.<br> See you later, ladies.<br> - He's blind and she's crazy.<br> - They're perfect for each other.<br> Nobody woke me up.<br> You know I always like to make breakfast<br> the first morning in a new house.<br> How were the beds?<br> OK.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're always sorry.<br> Well, I guess they add up, don't they?<br> I'm just a... sorry, sorry<br> excuse for a mother.<br> If you say so, Mom.<br> No. You're a good mother.<br> You know, life hands you<br> a lot of surprises, Alex.<br> I guess I must be one of yours.<br> - Morning, sir.<br> - Colonel Johnson?<br> Yes, sir. End of the corridor.<br> Major Henry T Marshall<br> reporting for duty, sir.<br> - Major Marshall. Good to have you here.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> This is Lieutenant Colonel George Land.<br> Major. We've heard<br> good things about your work.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - I'll let you two get down to business.<br> Sit down. Sit down, Major.<br> Did your trip go OK?<br> Your family settling in?<br> - Yes, sir. They're professionals.<br> - OK. Good.<br> Hi, there. I'm Vera Johnson.<br> And on behalf of the Fort Matthews<br> Women's Welcoming Committee,<br> I would like to welcome you<br> to our little community.<br> - Thank you. I'm Carly Marshall.<br> - Mm.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Oh, come in. I'm sorry.<br> You just come right on in.<br> - Oh, what a beautiful doll collection.<br> - Thank you.<br> So, you've been stationed in Hawaii?<br> For two years. The last two years.<br> Have you ever been in<br> Mexico or South America?<br> Yes. See, my father...<br> was in the diplomatic corps,<br> and, of course, we travelled<br> extensively all over the world.<br> When I was growin' up,<br> I don't think I was in the same place<br> for more than six months at a time.<br> Well, the officers' wives,<br> we're doing a show.<br> - Ooh!<br> - It's sort of a musical revue.<br> Do you need any dancers?<br> Thank you. Cream and sugar?<br> No, thank you.<br> You see, we're on point here.<br> We've got a nuclear test programme<br> that's become somethin'<br> of a political football.<br> And I don't like to see us<br> gettin' kicked around.<br> Yes, sir. I appreciate that.<br> If this damn test ban is ratified, Major,<br> you and me are slated to be among<br> the first to get our butts kicked.<br> If the test ban is ratified,<br> we simply abandon atmospheric tests<br> and go underground.<br> Given some of the test results I've seen,<br> I think that's the way to go.<br> Well, I can appreciate that.<br> But we're a team here.<br> We have to present one point of view.<br> You understand, you're a soldier.<br> Yes, sir, I'm a soldier,<br> and my duty is science.<br> We work for the army, not the AEC<br> or Congress or Popular Science.<br> - You understand?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Good. That'll be all, Major.<br> If I hadn't gotten married, I was going<br> to Hollywood for a screen test.<br> Well, you sure are pretty enough<br> to be in the movies.<br> I took ballet, too. Did I tell you?<br> I just loved gettin' flowers<br> after a performance.<br> Carly, these are just the greatest<br> bunch of gals you'd ever wanna know.<br> Now, they're just all gonna<br> make you feel real at home.<br> Come on.<br> Ladies... help has arrived.<br> - Mom's gonna kill you.<br> - No, she won't.<br> - Let's play a joke on her.<br> - What kind of joke?<br> We'll both lay down on the living-room<br> floor and pretend we're dead or sick.<br> Hello. I'm home.<br> Where's Mom?<br> - I don't know. Probably at the movies.<br> - She didn't leave a note?<br> Actually, school was pretty good.<br> The principal and his custodial staff<br> took turns raping me,<br> while Governor Wallace stood there and<br> watched and welcomed us to Alabama.<br> That's what you'd call<br> Southern hospitality.<br> Oh, Daddy's home.<br> I missed you. I'm glad to see you.<br> Sorry I'm late. Hello, girls!<br> Ta-da!<br> I've decided to become a make-up artist.<br> My face is my easel.<br> You're too fair to wear that dark eye<br> shadow and too young to wear make-up.<br> - I told you.<br> - Wife, I hope you got food in those bags.<br> Oh, I got that, and more.<br> We are gonna have a party tonight. Whoo!<br> Looky here.<br> That, my dear, is for you.<br> Goody.<br> And for my sweet man...<br> To replace the one that was lost in that<br> move to Japan, or Germany, or... Alaska.<br> Thanks, Mom.<br> - Will you teach me?<br> - As soon as you wash your pretty face.<br> A Selmer. Thank you, sweetheart.<br> I've been missing a clarinet.<br> Did you know your daddy worked<br> through college playin' in a band?<br> - My daddy? No. Major Squarehead?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I found that in the pawnshop, along with...<br> For Alexandra.<br> It's cos you're so smart,<br> and you see things so clearly, and...<br> - Well, you can be the family historian.<br> - Thank you, Mom.<br> It's got film and flashbulbs and...<br> Well, you just pose us and shoot away.<br> - Mom, what did you get?<br> - I get to make us a... indoor picnic.<br> All right, now we'll see<br> who's hot and who's not.<br> Play us some old bop, Pop.<br> Come on, honey.<br> Dance with me. I'll teach you how.<br> OK?<br> Try this.<br> Everybody!<br> Say "shit".<br> Shit.<br> - Enioy your drink.<br> - Alex.<br> Young ladies do not chew gum in public.<br> I am not a lady. I'm a teenager.<br> - Teenagers keep Wrigley's in business.<br> - Spit it out.<br> Carly.<br> A double vodka martini on the rocks,<br> two Shirley Temples and a bourbon.<br> - So, where's our host?<br> - Right over there.<br> Oh, at ease, Major. This is a party.<br> Colonel Johnson, I'd like<br> you to meet my wife Carly.<br> - Very pleased to meet you.<br> - How do you do, Colonel?<br> - Carly, hi!<br> - Vera, hi.<br> Major Marshall, it's so good<br> to meet you at last.<br> Carly's told me how kind<br> you've been to her.<br> We've been havin' so much fun<br> at rehearsals, haven't we?<br> I'd like you to meet my son Glenn.<br> This is Mrs. Marshall.<br> - Mrs. Marshall, how you doin'?<br> - Rebecca and Alexandra.<br> Your mother says<br> you're goin' to West Point.<br> Yes, ma'am, if they'll have me.<br> Haven't turned down a Johnson in five<br> generations. They'll be lucky to get you.<br> I've always said that Vince was born<br> to command and I was born to demand.<br> - Lucky you two found each other.<br> - Would you two like to play croquet?<br> - Go on. Go on, go play.<br> - OK.<br> You got a real bevy of beauties,<br> Major. I envy you.<br> And you are a flatterer, Colonel.<br> - The kids seem to hit it off real good.<br> - Alex isn't very shy.<br> No. You know, she gets<br> that quality from me.<br> Lord, you should've seen<br> when I was pursuing the major.<br> I just ran him ragged<br> till I finally let him catch me.<br> - Hi, girls.<br> - Hi.<br> - Thought you were goin' to another party.<br> - We are.<br> Mom went over to help<br> Mrs. Johnson with her make-up.<br> - What are you doin'?<br> - Probably stay home and watch TV.<br> Why don't you go<br> check out the teen centre?<br> Cos any place that<br> calls itself a teen centre<br> is probably full of people<br> who can't make friends.<br> In two months, neither of you<br> has brought home a friend.<br> Dad, most of your colleagues around here<br> are dedicated to a programme<br> of armed nuclear destruction.<br> I think they're cretins, and that<br> makes their offspring sub-cretins.<br> If you have a problem with sub-cretins,<br> don't complain. Go and enlighten them.<br> Yeah. Maybe I'll start the first<br> "teens for test ban" club.<br> That should make me real popular here.<br> Run away from home<br> and change your name first.<br> I really appreciate this, Carly.<br> Oh, I like to do it.<br> You always look so stylish.<br> Women like you are the reason<br> that men like women in the first place.<br> Well, a woman's charm<br> is mostly illusion, after all.<br> I suppose we all have<br> to grow old someday.<br> Mm.<br> I just don't think you gotta<br> look bad in the process.<br> I see these... fine little lines in my face.<br> They're called wrinkles.<br> Get used to it now.<br> I look in the mirror sometimes,<br> I see this... old woman lurkin' there,<br> just waitin' to grab me.<br> Oh, I just get so frightened.<br> Oh, you have such an active imagination.<br> I've seen you in those rehearsals.<br> Come on, don't you think that<br> good posture and keepin' fit<br> and keepin' active<br> is all a part of keepin' young, too?<br> Maybe if you're a woodpecker.<br> Welcome to the Fort Matthews<br> Hail and Farewell Dance.<br> - Come on, dance with me.<br> - No.<br> - Yes.<br> - I can't dance.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> - Major! Glad you could make it.<br> This is Ray Stevens from the AEC.<br> Now, I have heard that<br> gentlemen from the AEC are, by rule,<br> much better dancers than military men.<br> Is that true? My husband won't dance.<br> Well, the only time I really enjoyed<br> dancin' was when I was in the service.<br> - That was years ago.<br> - Hm.<br> I suppose it's up to me to uphold the<br> honour of the military on the dance floor.<br> Shall we?<br> You two just... share some<br> atomic secrets or somethin'.<br> - I don't know if I can do this.<br> - Oh, yeah, you can.<br> You'll like it.<br> Whoo!<br> I didn't risk my ass in Guam so some<br> Harvard boy could run us into the toilet.<br> If he can't stand up to the damn<br> Communists, let us do our jobs.<br> The hell with Nevada,<br> we'll use Havana for a test site!<br> I know you're a strong supporter<br> of underground testing.<br> Hell, that's only my stated position<br> in about 30 extremely obscure reports.<br> You guys must be buryin' those reports<br> deeper than the Moscow subway!<br> # .. my hopes and dreams come true<br> # My one and only you<br> Do you have any children, Mr. Stevens?<br> Four. I know what you're thinkin'.<br> # My only prayer will be<br> # Someday you'll care for me<br> # But it's only...<br> My eldest daughter wants to form<br> a test-ban club on the base.<br> - Sometimes I feel that way.<br> - Think we oughta join?<br> No.<br> # My hopes and dreams come true<br> # My life I give for you<br> - You sure?<br> - No.<br> Let me have another one.<br> # My heart I can't control<br> # You rule my very soul<br> # My only prayer will be<br> # Someday you'll care for me<br> # But it's only make believe<br> Uh-oh. Here comes the stop sign.<br> - Time to go, Carly.<br> - I wanna stay.<br> This gal's a real dynamo, Major.<br> You harness her energy,<br> we won't need reactors.<br> Come on, Daddy. Dance with me.<br> Time to go. Now. Let's go.<br> Then I'll dance by myself.<br> Now, that is an exceptional woman.<br> No!<br> Something should be done about this.<br> Yeah, well, I can always<br> requisition another one.<br> You're a pig.<br> Whoo! Yeah!<br> Agh!<br> Well, you know, when you're just... sitting<br> around and you're not doing anything,<br> in a moment of time<br> when nothing's happening?<br> Hm?<br> Well, I call that a... a "noment".<br> Ah.<br> And then when it's really hot, and you're<br> too lazy to get up and do anything?<br> Well, I call that a "slowment".<br> "Slowment", huh? What do you call this?<br> - Tongue kiss.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> - People were laughing!<br> - Just cos you never have fun<br> doesn't mean you have to spend your<br> entire life ruining mine. Son of a bitch!<br> - Why's Mom all wet?<br> - She had an accident.<br> Hi, Daddy.<br> Ten hut!<br> - Ten hut!<br> - As you were.<br> - How's it goin', Hank?<br> - Busy, sir.<br> You're gonna be a lot busier. We just got<br> word that some seismologists in Finland<br> have evidence that the Soviets<br> have detonated an above-ground device.<br> The brass must be thrilled<br> we're back in the game.<br> You bet your ass we are.<br> Everything we do from now on<br> becomes that much more vital.<br> They push in a pile of chips,<br> we'd better raise the bet, right?<br> Right.<br> We can maximise<br> our opportunities real quick.<br> Especially you.<br> As of 0800 hours, Friday 4l28,<br> you are TDY at Operations HQ<br> at the Nevada test site in Mercury.<br> To what do I owe this honour, sir?<br> Stevens from the AEC.<br> He was real impressed with you.<br> You got a clean slate<br> to start with this time.<br> I knew Vince Johnson<br> wasn't such a bad guy.<br> - This is a real vote of confidence in...<br> - Carly, do you remember your Bible?<br> Course I remember my Bible.<br> You know Grandpa was a preacher.<br> All right. How did David steal<br> Bathsheba away from her husband?<br> - He bought her a drink.<br> - No, silly.<br> He sent her husband away into battle,<br> where he was killed.<br> Second Samuel, verse 1 5.<br> - Monsieur, your car's waiting.<br> - Tell him I'll be right...<br> right there.<br> I don't want anything to happen to you.<br> Only thing that ever<br> happens to me is that I just...<br> I miss you too much.<br> Do you really have to be gone<br> for two whole weeks?<br> Yes, I do, baby.<br> That's enough time to convince them<br> to abandon nuclear weapons.<br> Yes, it is. You bet.<br> - Ooh! Daddy?<br> - What?<br> Will you call me every night<br> just before I go to bed?<br> No! Too expensive.<br> Of course I will.<br> - I love you.<br> - Love you, too. Be good.<br> About the strength of two hand grenades.<br> Don't worry, though. They're all spent.<br> They used to train GIs back here<br> in the Second World War.<br> - You can't tell anybody about this place.<br> - Never.<br> I like it.<br> I wouldn't wanna live here, but... it's nice.<br> It's private.<br> Let's get hitched and live here for ever.<br> To an army man? They're too weird.<br> Last year, Colonel Harris took his family<br> to Nevada to watch the A-bomb go off.<br> - That was their vacation.<br> - I'm not ashamed of what they're doin'.<br> I mean, the Manhattan Proiect<br> ended the last war.<br> - Maybe Blue Sky'll prevent the next one.<br> - Do you know why they call it Blue Sky?<br> They're gonna detonate the big one<br> underground to track radiation.<br> But you can't... see radiation.<br> You can't feel it or taste it or smell it.<br> So only a handful of people<br> know where it is,<br> and the rest of the country<br> could be swimmin' in the stuff.<br> But for all they know,<br> the sky's just as blue as ever.<br> Yeah, well, what they<br> don't know won't hurt 'em.<br> No wonder West Point snapped you up.<br> And if I married you,<br> I'd end up just like my mom.<br> You know, you talk<br> gibberish sometimes, Alex.<br> - Catch.<br> - No!<br> - What the hell was that?<br> - Manoeuvres don't start for two weeks.<br> Maybe them Cubans<br> sprung a sneak attack.<br> Jesus! Let's get the hell outta here.<br> What in the hell are<br> you doin' here, mister?<br> What do you know?<br> I mean, what's happened in here?<br> - Glenn!<br> - Oh, Alex!<br> Calm down! Calm down!<br> Everything's under control. It's all right.<br> Alex, are you OK?<br> We oughta take him to the hospital.<br> It looks like he needs stitches.<br> - Let's see.<br> - He needs a swift kick in the butt.<br> - Are you hurt?<br> - No.<br> I'd like to apologise for my son. I'm afraid<br> he was off limits with your daughter.<br> Well, boys will be boys.<br> Yeah. I'd like this area secured! Nobody<br> goes in or out! Go on home. Show's over!<br> I wanna know what<br> you were doin' up there.<br> Just what you told me to do:<br> making friends with Glenn.<br> I wanna know exactly what<br> the two of you were doin' up there!<br> What do you mean by "exactly"?<br> Well, was an old grenade<br> the only thing that went on?<br> I can't believe you. You don't care about<br> me. You just wanna know about sex stuff!<br> - Don't you sass me, sister!<br> - I am not your sister!<br> Well, if I had a sister,<br> I would tell her everything!<br> Especially... about boys.<br> Ooh! Boys! Do-do-do-do-do!<br> What are you doing here?<br> I've come to kidnap you and take you to<br> the woods. I left my knife at the bungalow.<br> - Will you come with?<br> - That place is dangerous.<br> - Not any more. My dad had it cleaned up.<br> - If my mom finds out...<br> She's gonna be at rehearsal for hours.<br> Come on.<br> - I've gotta finish up my chores.<br> - All right, but I gotta help.<br> - That's what I'm here for.<br> - OK. Come in.<br> Wait. Come back here.<br> - Come in, Rad Two. Over.<br> - Base station, this is Rad Site Two. Over.<br> Rad Two, hold in place.<br> This underground stun's not like<br> the old days. Look at all this junk.<br> Hell, in Bikini, you could feel the wind<br> from the blast to the atmosphere.<br> Flying particles as big as cornflakes.<br> Coming up on 60 seconds, sir.<br> All cameras, report.<br> Ground cameras, report. Over.<br> Camera one ready.<br> Camera two ready.<br> Camera three ready.<br> - Camera four ready.<br> - Camera five ready.<br> Nuclear underground test number OO1.<br> Clear and counting.<br> All systems green.<br> All safeties are on and ready.<br> All personnel in position and holding.<br> Standing by. Final log position<br> procedure complete.<br> - What the hell is that?<br> - Let's take a peek.<br> Rad Site Two. We have two civilians<br> on horseback heading right toward site.<br> - Punch up a camera on those cowboys.<br> - Base station!<br> We gotta get 'em outta there.<br> Please advise. We cannot detonate!<br> - Abort the test!<br> - It's too late.<br> Detonate.<br> Oh, they did it!<br> It's 15!<br> Radiation's right off the scale.<br> This is Rad Site Two. We have<br> massive radiation in Sector Four.<br> Rad Two, return to base.<br> Rad Two, return to base.<br> - General, we gotta find those guys!<br> - The fox has left the henhouse.<br> We're not talkin' about chickens, sir.<br> We're talkin' about human lives!<br> These things happen.<br> Every TV station, every radio station,<br> every newspaper was notified of this test!<br> They were in the wrong place<br> at the wrong time.<br> I beg the general's pardon, but that is<br> bullshit. Those men have been cooked!<br> There's ways to handle it, Major. We'll be<br> notifying the local medical authorities.<br> - These men'll come in for treatment.<br> - Very good, if they're alive.<br> - Goddamn it, we've gotta keep a lid on it!<br> - There'll be no talk about this.<br> You can't even tell your dog.<br> Back away from the door, Hank.<br> Let's go have a drink.<br> - It's criminal. They should be found.<br> - Right.<br> - No, it's a crime.<br> - Right, they should, but we can't.<br> So forget it.<br> They're exposed. It's too late to do<br> anything for 'em, pal. It's too damn late.<br> Jimmy, I have dedicated my life<br> to counting alpha particles.<br> And beta particles and gamma rays.<br> I monitor radioiodine levels.<br> I calculate isotopic half-lives.<br> Things you can't see or hear or feel.<br> Things unknowable to the common man,<br> who winds up dead as shit.<br> - It's a crime.<br> - Your work's done here.<br> Forget about it.<br> It's a goddamn crime, and I am<br> going to forget precisely nothing.<br> And no one.<br> Fayrene, two more.<br> Bravo!<br> - Good night, ladies!<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, girls.<br> - I am so hot.<br> - Uh-oh. Here she goes.<br> - Next year we should do Gypsy.<br> Wouldn't our husbands just love that?<br> God, I could never do that. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> You know, I bet you really<br> could've been in movies.<br> I wanted that.<br> Oh, I really did.<br> You know, sometimes I think...<br> I could just disappear,<br> and no one would<br> ever know I'd been here.<br> That's why we have children.<br> And mine need tuckin' up about now.<br> D'you want a ride?<br> - No.<br> - OK. Night.<br> If the show's as good as<br> the rehearsal, you got a hit.<br> How's Glenn?<br> He's OK.<br> You know, that routine might be<br> a little risqu for the base.<br> Might... overexcite some of the men.<br> I thought men joined the army<br> lookin' for adventure.<br> You been watchin' too many war movies.<br> I hate war movies.<br> I need your help.<br> Zip me up.<br> You know, zippin' you up<br> is not exactly what I had in mind.<br> No?<br> No.<br> No.<br> Meet me outside.<br> - Maybe this isn't such a good idea.<br> - It's all right.<br> Ahh!<br> Let's go. Let's just go.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Come on. Let's go.<br> - Get away from me!<br> - Alex, open the door.<br> - I'm gonna tell him.<br> Alex, please!<br> Please what? "Please talk to me"<br> or "Please don't tell Daddy"?<br> You're not even sorry for what you did.<br> You're just afraid of getting caught!<br> That's not true.<br> How could you do this to him?<br> Everybody's gonna find out.<br> If I don't tell him, they're all gonna<br> laugh at him behind his back.<br> I hate you!<br> I'm gonna tell him.<br> When?<br> - Operator.<br> - Long distance, please.<br> - City and the state, please.<br> - Mercury, Nevada.<br> One moment, please.<br> - AEC, Mercury.<br> - Major Hank Marshall, please.<br> Call for Major Marshall, line one.<br> Line one, Major Marshall.<br> This is Hank Marshall.<br> Hank?<br> Daddy, when are you coming home?<br> Sweetheart, you're gonna have<br> to speak up. I can barely hear you.<br> I have to...<br> I have to tell you something,<br> and it's hard for me to...<br> What is it, baby? I can't hear.<br> After rehearsal tonight,<br> Vince Johnson drove me home.<br> And...<br> I can't hear you. You're gonna<br> have to speak up now, really loud.<br> Wait a minute,<br> I'll try to find a different line.<br> After rehearsal tonight,<br> Vince Johnson drove me home.<br> Vince Johnson drove me home.<br> Just a mistake, Daddy.<br> And...<br> I... I... I can't...<br> - Hi, Daddy!<br> - Hello, baby.<br> She's at the Officers' Club.<br> Tonight's the show.<br> - Oh, Lord. Where is she?<br> - Check the motels.<br> Ah, here she comes.<br> Lock up your husbands, girls.<br> - Hello.<br> - Boy, am I nervous. I just hope I don't trip.<br> Don't worry.<br> We've been practising for weeks.<br> What have you got to be worried about?<br> I'm the one with two left feet.<br> Hey, why don't you come over<br> to my house after the show?<br> - Sounds great.<br> - I could use a break from the kids.<br> Can I talk with you, Vera?<br> Why? Sit down and have a drink<br> and go over the gory details?<br> The things you like to share with friends?<br> People like you come and go, Carly.<br> You mean just one less<br> Christmas card to me.<br> Five minutes, ladies.<br> Can I still do my number?<br> God! Is that all you can think of?<br> All my life, people<br> have told lies about me.<br> Even when I was little,<br> other girls used to make up stories.<br> # Hernando's Hideaway<br> # Hernando's Hideaway<br> At least one of 'em's got nice legs.<br> # Hernando's Hideaway<br> - I need to talk to you.<br> - Later, Marshall.<br> Now. I need to talk to you right now.<br> - This is not the time.<br> - I need to talk to you right fucking now!<br> - If this is a personal...<br> - It's not personal. It's about Blue Sky.<br> # Hernando's Hideaway<br> # Ol<br> Look, I'm not gonna talk about this shit<br> with you now or any other time. All right?<br> two people in Mercury, Nevada,<br> who are now facing blindness,<br> leukaemia and cancer.<br> - One more word, you're court-martialled.<br> - You don't have the balls.<br> You're just jealous<br> because you can't satisfy...<br> Hank!<br> Oh, God!<br> I just hurt all over.<br> - Maybe we can call it even, Daddy.<br> - I doubt it.<br> We've done too much<br> damage to each other.<br> I'm the one all bandaged up.<br> I can't even imagine<br> what it's gonna look like.<br> I always loved looking at you.<br> I even enjoyed other men looking at you.<br> But you always take everything<br> right over the edge, don't you?<br> It didn't mean anything. You know that.<br> Oh, I know it didn't mean anything.<br> Just like all the other times.<br> It meant a lot to me.<br> I don't know how much longer<br> I can go on. I'm tired.<br> I'm real tired.<br> Gotta go see about the girls.<br> She's gonna be fine. Doctor says<br> she can come home in two days.<br> Lydia, will you take<br> the girls home, please?<br> Go on.<br> Mrs. Marshall, this can't come off for<br> another week, and it'll heal up just fine.<br> In a few weeks you'll need<br> a magnifying glass just to see it.<br> I'm gonna need dark make-up and heavy<br> lisle stockings for the rest of my life.<br> Now, now. You just relax.<br> You've got a visitor coming up.<br> - Who?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Hm.<br> - Brought you some flowers.<br> Vince.<br> Hank's in big trouble.<br> You should know that, Carly.<br> Well, this whole thing<br> doesn't look good for anyone.<br> It's real... messy,<br> and I like to keep a clean base.<br> Besides, I...<br> Well, I feel... personally responsible.<br> We're both responsible.<br> You don't know<br> how much I need him.<br> Nobody understands that.<br> Well, uh...<br> There is one way we could get him out.<br> Maybe.<br> Daddy, I've brought some good news.<br> Vince Johnson has figured out<br> a way to help us out of all of this.<br> He had me sign some papers,<br> to put you in the hospital for just<br> a couple of weeks, just for observation.<br> And then the whole thing<br> is written off to stress.<br> You've had me committed.<br> No! No, it's not as bad as it sounds.<br> It's hardly going<br> to affect your record at all.<br> - Is that what he told you?<br> - Yes. That's what he told me.<br> He also told me<br> that the only other alternative<br> would be a court martial.<br> Court martial is what I wanted.<br> It's my only chance to tell what happened.<br> A court martial would mean<br> eight years in prison, he said.<br> It would mean a dishonourable discharge.<br> No pension, no transfer, no nothing.<br> Darling, this is a setup.<br> We've been set up.<br> - We've orders remanding you to hospital.<br> - Let me see 'em.<br> - This was verbal, from Colonel Johnson.<br> - Get me the Adjutant General's office.<br> Our orders are to remove you<br> from here and remand you to VGH.<br> Get me the Adjutant General's office,<br> then I'll consider moving.<br> Consider this. You either stand up now,<br> or we'll drag your ass out so fast your butt<br> won't say goodbye to your shorts.<br> Do I make myself clear, sir?<br> Major Marshall, which room is he in?<br> - I'm sorry. He's not allowed visitors.<br> - I'm his wife. I'm Mrs. Marshall.<br> Of course I can see him.<br> Mrs. Marshall, there are procedures<br> to be followed in the hospital.<br> How long do those procedures take?<br> - About two weeks.<br> - Two weeks? For what?<br> We are doing everything<br> we possibly can for Major Marshall.<br> Right. And I'm Jackie Kennedy,<br> and flyin' saucers just stole my dog.<br> But I don't wanna see him there.<br> Daddy'll be home soon.<br> It has taken me two weeks<br> to get permission to visit him.<br> Now, he's gonna need<br> a hug from his little baby.<br> Besides, there's nothing to be scared of.<br> He's in a hospital but he's not sick,<br> or anything like that.<br> Besides, we're gonna have a...<br> We're gonna have a picnic.<br> Now... You're not even dressed!<br> Go on, get dressed!<br> I don't wanna be late.<br> You want me to fix your hair?<br> I can do it myself.<br> OK. Daddy likes mayonnaise.<br> Daddy likes a little pepper.<br> Now, everyone here is under temporary<br> sedation, so don't be alarmed.<br> His condition can change instantly.<br> Daddy!<br> I made...<br> Made these for us?<br> Almost.<br> Alex, you go after your sister.<br> Hi, Daddy.<br> I brought you a picnic.<br> I bet you could use<br> some good coffee, huh?<br> Excuse me, ma'am.<br> Oh, damn!<br> He's a nuclear engineer! They got<br> him making wallets. How can they...<br> They?! You! You did this!<br> Stop it!<br> What are you doing?<br> Just wiping off the ice cream.<br> Welcome to Fort Matthews<br> Memorial Day parade.<br> Participating in our Memorial Day parade<br> is the Maxwell Air Force Base drill team.<br> Fort Matthews is under the command<br> of Colonel Vincent P Johnson.<br> Joining the military band, we have<br> the Selma High drum and bugle corps.<br> Today, we are honoured to have local<br> veterans of the First World War on hand.<br> Let's have a big round of applause<br> for our patriotic doughboys.<br> Coming onto the parade ground next<br> is our fine Prattville High marching band,<br> playing "Host of Freedom".<br> They can't do this to Daddy.<br> Mom, what are you doing?<br> You will burn in hell<br> you lying son of a bi'tch!<br> You lying son of a bitch!<br> Do you think craziness is hereditary?<br> I don't know. It's not exactly something<br> we could ask either one of them.<br> Mommy, what are we gonna do?<br> Here's yesterday's mail.<br> There's a letter here<br> for Dad, from Nevada.<br> Daddy!<br> Alex? Alex. Alex, wake up.<br> Becky? Becky, get up.<br> Quickly. Come on, girls, get up.<br> We're goin' on a trip.<br> Hurry up. Pack a bag.<br> Help your sister.

"<br> - Maybe they're already dead.<br> Oh, shut up.<br> Hello, there.<br> My wife tells me you're<br> concerned with our health.<br> Well, yes, I am. Of course I am.<br> But mostly it's my husband.<br> You see, he was in<br> a helicopter that day. He saw it.<br> He tried to stop the test,<br> but of course it was too late.<br> - What's done is done.<br> - The army are drugging him<br> and holding him against his will<br> in some mental hospital.<br> But you can help me.<br> How can we do that?<br> I was just hoping that you would<br> come with me to the newspapers.<br> You could tell them just how sick<br> you've been, and how nobody - nobody! -<br> bothered to come by and explain<br> to you what had happened.<br> They would have to understand that<br> my husband's not crazy, not crazy at all.<br> - Don't believe we could do that.<br> - It's true. She's telling you the truth.<br> It ain't our way.<br> We don't like to make a fuss.<br> He's right. Besides,<br> there's another one tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow morning, about 10, 10.30.<br> And we're gonna be out here working.<br> If my government tells me there's no<br> danger, then, by God, I gotta believe 'em.<br> But that... I don't mean to be rude,<br> but that is so stupid.<br> That is just plain stupid.<br> Mom, why don't we go?<br> Take this lady back to the house<br> and tell her goodbye.<br> Come on, sweetie.<br> Good luck.<br> We've got the pilot's letter<br> and we've got Dad's reports.<br> Why don't we go to the newspapers<br> without the cowboys?<br> That's all we really need, isn't it?<br> Mom?<br> Mom?<br> Mom?<br> Alex? Alex, wake up.<br> Alex! Mom's gone.<br> Welcome to our underground bunker.<br> This is our test site today.<br> The tower is used to drill deep enough<br> to place the device securely underground.<br> The cables you see are linked to record<br> every reaction the material may provoke.<br> In this way, we can assure<br> our full strength... and your full safety.<br> Excuse me, General. Who's that?<br> - Not again!<br> - Abort detonation.<br> Get a squad out there immediately.<br> Get off your horse. You're under arrest.<br> Aside from almost blowing yourself<br> sky-high, what the hell were you doin'?<br> General, I am simply trying to get<br> my husband out of a mental hospital.<br> You are well on your way<br> to going there yourself.<br> Did you know that my father<br> is a very prominent businessman?<br> In fact, he owns several television<br> stations back home in Virginia.<br> He has copies of those reports,<br> those classified reports,<br> and if he doesn't hear from me by noon,<br> he'll release 'em to The New York Times.<br> Mrs. Marshall, please.<br> Threats and fantasies don't help.<br> The army knows exactly who you are.<br> I know who you are.<br> And you know my husband.<br> You know that there is not<br> a crazy bone in his body.<br> Not as crazy as his wife.<br> You know, I've been called that all my life.<br> That and a lot worse.<br> And it doesn't bother me in the least.<br> You can tell people<br> whatever you want about me.<br> - Just release my husband.<br> - We're not here to make deals.<br> We can have you arrested on<br> What are you gonna tell those reporters?<br> What are you gonna tell<br> those reporters and their cameras?<br> - I'm their story.<br> - Today's paper is tomorrow's trash...<br> General. General.<br> Mr. Stevens.<br> My husband said that<br> you were a fair man.<br> Won't you help him?<br> Authorities at a nuclear test site<br> in Mercury, Nevada,<br> arrested an unidentified woman<br> this morning,<br> who was attempting to interfere<br> with a scheduled weapons test.<br> Hey, look! That's Mrs. Marshall.<br> That's Mrs. Marshall. Mom, come here!<br> - Mom!<br> - According to the army,<br> the woman was carrying literature<br> linking her to the Communist Party.<br> The army also claimed she is a member<br> of a fundamentalist religious sect.<br> Officials refuse to disclose the identity...<br> The goddamn bitch.<br> The test has been postponed<br> due to weather conditions.<br> Also in the news, members of the...<br> Ben, this is the game plan. Prepare<br> discharge papers for Marshall right away.<br> We could be in deep shit.<br> What are you doin', Dad?<br> I've got to go to the base.<br> You're gonna discharge Major Marshall?<br> You said he was dangerous. You said<br> he was crazy, he was mentally ill.<br> He is.<br> But it's a little more<br> complicated than that, Glenn.<br> - Look, it's a military matter. OK?<br> - I thought this was a matter of justice.<br> That's what I told Alex when<br> she said her dad was framed.<br> I've got to go.<br> This doesn't concern you, son.<br> I used to be proud when<br> you called me your son.<br> I mean, all my life you've lectured<br> me about honour and justice<br> and the Johnson tradition.<br> I believed all that.<br> Those words lost their meaning<br> for your father a while ago.<br> This is a personal war between a man<br> and a woman that he wanted to screw.<br> It's as simple as that, Glenn.<br> - Just get me out of here.<br> - Glenn!<br> Dr. Vankay is waiting for you, Colonel.<br> - Vince.<br> - Ben. Is everything OK?<br> - What are you doing here, George?<br> - Order of General Nieremberg.<br> To do what?<br> To provide for the safe treatment<br> and the discharge of Hank Marshall.<br> I was also ordered to relieve you<br> as commanding officer,<br> pending further orders.<br> Effective immediately.<br> You just sleep, babies.<br> What's wrong?<br> My leg fell asleep.<br> We've been drivin' for two days.<br> I wanted to get here as fast as I could.<br> I didn't know if you would be waiting.<br> Next base, I'll be different, I promise.<br> There won't be a next base.<br> I've quit the army.<br> Oh, the girls are gonna be real...<br> happy to hear that.<br> What about you, Mrs. Marshall?<br> Are you happy?<br> Only if you still want me.<br> Come here.<br> Aren't you going to find<br> teaching to be a bit tame?<br> When I was in Nevada, I decided I could<br> no longer contribute to nuclear warfare.<br> I think that university is a fine place<br> to twist innocent young minds over<br> to my point of view. Don't you agree?<br> Can you see Mom as a professor's wife?<br> It is California. Maybe things<br> are a little looser there.<br> - I want a shot of you and Glenn.<br> - What?<br> I want a shot of you and Glenn.<br> Well, come on.<br> Get closer. Closer.<br> Wow!<br> - What a great car!<br> - Great car, Mom.<br> What are you doing?<br> We're goin' to California. We can't drive<br> up to the Brown Derby in that old jalopy.<br> I liked that old jalopy.<br> Now, nobody has said<br> anything about my hair.<br> You look like Elizabeth Taylor.<br> There. You have said the secret word,<br> and you qualify for a ride in my<br> new convertible. Come on, sweet boy.<br> Well, let's go.<br> Come on, Daddy. You drive.<br> # Well, now, it takes more than a robin<br> # To make the winter go<br> # And it takes two lips of fire<br> # To melt away the snow<br> # Well, it takes two hearts a-cookin'<br> # To make a fire grow<br> # And, baby<br> # You've got what it takes<br> # Oh, yeah<br> - # You know, it takes a lot of kissin'<br> - # Tell me about it<br> # To make a romance sweet<br> # Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin'<br> # To make my life complete<br> # Mmm, and it takes a lot of woman<br> # To knock me off my feet<br> # And, baby<br> # You've got what it takes<br> # I said, mmm<br> # Ah-ha<br> # Mmm<br> # You know, you've got just what it takes<br> # Because it takes more than an effort<br> # To stay away from you<br> # It'd take more than a lifetime<br> # To prove that I'll be true<br> # But it takes somebody special<br> - # To make me say "I do"<br> - # Oh, yeah<br> # And, baby<br> # You've got what it takes<br> # Ah-ha<br> # Mmm<br> # Mmm<br> # You know you've got just what it takes<br> - # Because it takes... oh, yeah<br> - # Start again, honey<br> - # I like your style<br> - # To stay away from you<br> - # I can't stay away from you<br> - # It takes more than a lifetime, Daddy<br> # To prove that I'll be true<br> Now it's you<br> - # But it takes somebody special<br> - # Like me, baby<br> # To make me say "I do"<br> - # And, baby<br> - # Baby<br> # You've got what it takes<br> - # Say it again<br> - # Let's do it one more time, all right?<br> - # And, baby<br> - # Baby<br> # You've got what it takes<br> # One more time<br>
