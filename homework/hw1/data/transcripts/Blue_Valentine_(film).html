That<br> would make me feel better, he's fat?<br> So what? If he was in good shape,<br> I shouldn't feel good?<br> I said the wrong thing.<br> I'm nervous, OK?<br> - What do you mean you're nervous?<br> - I feel funny, because you feel funny.<br> You're nervous 'cause I feel funny?<br> - What does that mean?<br> - I feel like I said the wrong thing.<br> I feel like I shouldn't have<br> said anything.<br> Really? That's an option?<br> You run into Bobby Ontario<br> and it's an option not to tell me?<br> I feel like you're upset,<br> and I upset you and I'm sorry.<br> And I said the wrong thing.<br> Baby... you can do whatever you want.<br> OK.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Fuck.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I gotta pee.<br> - Where, in this person's house?<br> - Fuck you.<br> Fuck me.<br> Hi.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Research.<br> Really, research.<br> So what, I mean,<br> you're supposed to be a quadriplegic?<br> No, quads can't use their arms.<br> I'm a paraplegic.<br> Really?<br> Hi.<br> Why do you have to act like<br> such a freak all the time, huh? Huh?<br> Come over.<br> - Come on.<br> - I can't.<br> - I can't.<br> - You know you want it.<br> I gotta go get Gramma.<br> I just came to say hi.<br> - Call you later.<br> - Yeah. Whatever!<br> - Oh! I thought you were Dad.<br> - Just us.<br> - How was the beauty parlor?<br> - Oh, lovely, just lovely.<br> Good.<br> What did it feel like<br> when you fell in love?<br> Ooh...<br> Oh, dear.<br> I don't think I found it.<br> Even with Grandpa?<br> Maybe a little in the beginning.<br> Bless us, O Lord, for these, thy gifts<br> which we are about to receive...<br> He didn't really have<br> any regard for me as a person.<br> You've gotta be careful of that.<br> You've gotta be careful that<br> the person that you fall in love...<br> ...is worth it to you.<br> I don't ever want<br> to be like my parents.<br> I know that they must have loved<br> each other at one time, right?<br> Did they just get it all out of the way<br> before they had me?<br> We're supposed to<br> eat this garbage?<br> Huh?!<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Do you want me to make you some eggs?<br> - No!<br> I want you to enjoy<br> your goddamned dinner!<br> How do you trust your feelings<br> when they can just disappear like that?<br> I think the only way you can<br> find out is... to have the feeling.<br> You're a good person, honey.<br> I think you have the right to say,<br> "Yes, I do trust."<br> "I trust myself."<br> What?<br> What, what?<br> - Fuck!<br> - Shit.<br> - Fuck!<br> - Sorry.<br> "Somehow, she didn't want to<br> confess to him that she was still wary"<br> of all those people who'd<br> seemed to want to care about her.<br> He touched her cheek gently,<br> caressing her.<br> Her heart was beating so loudly<br> that surely he could hear it. <br> Arms up.<br> "He smoothed her hair back,"<br> the touch of his fingers sending<br> waves of awareness through her.<br> He was going to kiss her.<br> That was what she wanted, wasn't it?<br> So why did she feel as if she trembled<br> on the edge of a precipice,<br> ready to topple over in an instant?<br> Then his lips found hers<br> and she stopped thinking at all,<br> only feeling,<br> feeling the tenderness of his kiss,<br> the strength of his arms around her...<br> ...the steady beat of his heart under<br> her hand as she turned into his arms.<br> There is a precipice,<br> and she was falling.<br> Head over heels.<br> Falling in love with him.<br> "Chapter 11 ..."<br> Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - I want a cigarette.<br> - No, Gramma, it's bedtime.<br> You're in bed.<br> You can't have a cigarette now, OK?<br> Do you want me<br> to keep reading or are you tired?<br> I need a cigarette!<br> Excuse me.<br> Can I talk to you for a second?<br> Why?<br> You think I stole that money, don't you?<br> - Yeah, you do.<br> - No.<br> Look, I've stolen money before, OK?<br> I know what it's like to get busted.<br> - That's what it feels like.<br> - OK.<br> I didn't steal it. I got a job.<br> - OK? This is my job.<br> - All right.<br> - All right? I make money.<br> - OK, I got it.<br> Money I can take girls out<br> on dates with.<br> Just so you know.<br> Good to know. OK.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Go away.<br> - "Go away"?<br> - Go away.<br> That's a weird name.<br> OK, hold on a second.<br> I wanna give you something.<br> Look at that. That's my business card.<br> I don't have a phone...<br> or a phone number,<br> but if you call<br> this number right here...<br> ...and then you ask for me...<br> - ...they'll tell me you called.<br> - Great.<br> Who should I say is calling?<br> Whoa!<br> Where are we, huh?<br> We're inside a robot's vagina.<br> Was this the only one<br> that they had?<br> I told you, you know...<br> they had Cupid's Cove or this.<br> You want me to see<br> if we can get Cupid's Cove?<br> I'm gonna make a drink.<br> There's no windows.<br> Cool bed, huh? Check this out.<br> Whoa!<br> The bed turns.<br> Hey, did you see this?<br> Hey.<br> Hey, look at me.<br> I don't think that there's a fridge.<br> Hey, that's how they laugh<br> in the future. Like this...<br> Oh, God.<br> I thought the whole point of coming here<br> was to have a night without kids.<br> Hello? Yeah, hold on.<br> Here, sweetheart, it's your mommy.<br> She wants to talk to you.<br> - Hi, Mom.<br> - Hi, sweetie!<br> Yes.<br> OK, honey. Don't forget<br> to go potty before you get into bed, OK?<br> Bye... Bye, I love you!<br> Frankie, this is<br> how they laugh in the future.<br> Try it.<br> Huh?<br> Frankie, are you tooting?<br> Is that you tooting?<br> Frankie... I can hear...<br> I love you like crazy. I gotta go, OK?<br> Kiss, kiss.<br> Bye-bye.<br> What are you doing?<br> What? What's it look like I'm doing?<br> Getting all wet and naked.<br> I'm gonna go order some food.<br> Do you want some?<br> You know what I like.<br> Can you close the door?<br> Oh.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - What does it look like I'm doing?<br> All right.<br> Come up.<br> Come up.<br> What are you so grumpy about?<br> Oh, I don't know. I don't know why.<br> - Do you want a drink?<br> - Yes, please.<br> - Hey, how are you?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> You're Gramma.<br> It's great to meet you.<br> Cindy, come on.<br> Could you talk to me<br> for five minutes, please?<br> I don't want to talk to you anymore.<br> Gramma, you know you have<br> an amazing granddaughter?<br> - Oh, of course I do.<br> - She's unbelievable.<br> I got these for you.<br> Would you please take them?<br> Cindy, come on,<br> would you give me five minutes?<br> This is ridiculous.<br> You're not even gonna talk to me?<br> Come on, Cindy.<br> I'm trying to say I'm sorry,<br> and you're acting like a total bitch!<br> I don't know, I just<br> feel like I should just stop...<br> You know, just stop thinking<br> about it, but I can't.<br> Maybe I've seen too many movies,<br> you know, love at first sight.<br> - Anyone call?<br> - No.<br> Thanks.<br> What do you think<br> about love at first sight?<br> You think you can love somebody<br> just by looking at 'em?<br> - By looking at 'em?<br> - But the thing is, man,<br> I felt like I knew her. You know?<br> You ever get that feeling?<br> Yeah, like, you've seen her<br> before and you just know her...<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's a feeling.<br> But, actually,<br> you really don't know her.<br> - Yeah, I probably... I don't, right?<br> - That's right.<br> - I felt like I did, though.<br> - If you get a little pussy...<br> ...I think all the mental-ness<br> will go away from you.<br> You think<br> I'm too much in my head?<br> Yeah, too much.<br> You already know<br> where she live at, right?<br> No, she was just, like,<br> visiting her grandmother.<br> So why don't you go back<br> to that grandmother...<br> - ...and ask her where she lives?<br> - I should go back, right?<br> Yeah. If you like her; yeah.<br> She just seems different,<br> you know? I don't know.<br> Wait. How different?<br> I don't know,<br> I just got a feeling about her.<br> You know when a song comes on<br> and you just gotta dance?<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Do you know<br> what happened to Walter?<br> - Who?<br> - Walter.<br> He's the gentlemen that just moved in<br> across the hall about a month ago.<br> I don't know anything<br> or anybody named Walter.<br> Oh.<br> OK.<br> Hey, can I ask you something else?<br> What's the story with that girl<br> that was in here like a month ago?<br> The blonde, the young blonde?<br> I gave her my card,<br> but she never called me.<br> What's her name?<br> - Cindy.<br> - Cindy.<br> - Will you tell her I say hi?<br> - OK. Why not.<br> Shit.<br> Do you think I could sit down,<br> because all these other seats are taken.<br> - OK.<br> - Hey, thanks.<br> You know, I just talked<br> to your grandmother.<br> That sounds weird, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - OK, let me put it into context.<br> I went out there to see Walter,<br> who's not there anymore.<br> That's why I talked to her.<br> Do you know what happened<br> to that guy, Walter?<br> Yeah, do you know what happened<br> to that guy, Walter?<br> No, I don't know what happened<br> to that guy, Walter.<br> What happened?<br> You gotta do it like that?<br> - What do you expect?<br> - What do you mean?<br> They're old.<br> Would you want to live like that?<br> - Like what? In that home?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, no but I'm not getting old<br> and he's a dummy for dying.<br> - Walter's a dummy for dying?<br> - Yeah.<br> What are you gonna do, wise guy?<br> Not do it.<br> - Are you gonna die?<br> - Definitely.<br> Hmm?<br> - What'd you say?<br> - I said definitely.<br> Well, with that kind<br> of attitude, you will.<br> Don't do it. It's for suckers.<br> Don't do it.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - Just not do it.<br> I went out there to give him this.<br> Isn't that nice? I found it.<br> Look at that.<br> - Is that him?<br> - Yeah, and his lady.<br> - Isn't he handsome?<br> - Look at her, she's so pretty.<br> So she's probably nuts, then.<br> In my experience, the prettier<br> a girl is, the more nuts she is.<br> Which makes you insane.<br> You're probably nutty-coo-coo crazy.<br> It's not your fault.<br> You know, it's just like...<br> Everybody treats you different.<br> Like, you make jokes and they're<br> not funny, but people laugh anyway.<br> That's gotta make you nuts.<br> I like how you can compliment<br> and insult somebody at the same time.<br> In equal measure.<br> What's an insult about that?<br> That I'm crazy and I'm not funny.<br> Well... I don't know if you're<br> not funny, tell me a joke.<br> So there's a child molester<br> and a little boy walking into the woods.<br> The child molester and the little boy<br> keep walking further and further,<br> and it's getting darker and darker<br> and they're going deeper and deeper<br> into the woods and the child molester...<br> ...and the little boy looks up<br> at the child molester and he says,<br> "Gee, mister, I'm getting scared!"<br> And the child molester<br> looks down at him and says,<br> "You think you're scared, kid?<br> I gotta walk outta here alone."<br> You don't think that's funny?<br> - No, I'm sorry.<br> - I do.<br> You get along<br> with your grandma, huh?<br> Yeah, she makes me laugh.<br> Nobody else talks in my family.<br> And when they talk, they just yell.<br> I'm never getting married.<br> This is a nice place, you live.<br> You like it?<br> - It's all right.<br> - Where you wanna go?<br> I wanna go away to school.<br> - What are you gonna study?<br> - Medicine.<br> Really?<br> - Yeah, really.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> Yeah, right.<br> Girls like you... Girls that look like<br> you don't go and study medicine.<br> What do I look like?<br> Girls like you are Supermodels.<br> - You got any, like, talents?<br> - Like hidden talents?<br> Uh...<br> That's all the presidents.<br> That was rad.<br> Can you dance?<br> - You can tap dance?<br> - Can you?<br> No. Here, I'll play a song<br> and you dance.<br> OK?<br> Come here.<br> Come here, like this.<br> Right here, behind the heart.<br> In front of the heart.<br> OK.<br> I can't really sing.<br> I have to sing goofy in order to sing.<br> Like, I have to sing stupid.<br> - OK?<br> - OK.<br> You're actually good.<br> OK, slow dance.<br> Slow dance to this part.<br> Whooo!<br> You're not gonna eat that?<br> Why don't you do something?<br> What do you mean?<br> I don't know.<br> What does that mean?<br> - Why don't I do something?<br> - Isn't there something you want to do?<br> There something you want to do?<br> - Like what?<br> - I don't know.<br> You're so good at so many things,<br> you could do anything you wanted to do,<br> you're good at everything that you do,<br> isn't there something else you wanna do?<br> Than what? Than be your<br> husband? To be Frankie's dad?<br> What do you want me to do?<br> What... In your, like, dream scenario,<br> of me, like, doing what I'm good at,<br> what would that be?<br> I don't know,<br> you're so good at so many things,<br> you can do so many things,<br> you have such capacity.<br> For what?<br> You can sing, you can draw, you can...<br> ...dance.<br> Listen, I didn't<br> wanna be somebody's husband.<br> OK?<br> And I didn't wanna be somebody's dad.<br> That wasn't my goal in life.<br> Some guys it is... Wasn't mine.<br> But somehow, I've...<br> It was what I wanted.<br> I didn't know that.<br> And it's all I wanna do...<br> I don't want to do anything else.<br> That's what I want to do.<br> I work so I can do that.<br> I'd like to see you have a job<br> where you didn't have to start drinking<br> at eight o'clock<br> in the morning to go to it.<br> No, I have a job that I can drink<br> at eight o'clock in the morning.<br> What a luxury, you know?<br> I get up for work, I have a beer,<br> I go to work, I paint somebody's house,<br> they're excited about it,<br> I come home, I get to be with you.<br> What's... like... This is the dream.<br> It doesn't ever disappoint you?<br> Why? Why would it disappoint me?<br> - Because you have all this potential.<br> - I could still do whatever I could do.<br> So what? Why do you have to<br> fucking make money off your potential?<br> Look, I'm not even saying<br> you have to make money off it.<br> - Don't you miss it?<br> - What does even potential mean?<br> What does that mean, potential?<br> Potential for what?<br> To turn it into what?<br> We rarely sit down and have an adult<br> conversation, because every time we do<br> you take what I say and you turn it<br> around into something I didn't mean.<br> You just... twist it.<br> Start blabbing,<br> blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.<br> If you're not interested<br> in what I have to say,<br> then maybe I just<br> shouldn't say anything.<br> That's funny, huh?<br> What's funny about that?<br> Good luck. I...<br> I'd like to see you think<br> about what you say,<br> instead of saying what you think<br> all the time. Good luck, give it a try!<br> What do you mean?<br> - You wanna fight me?<br> - Yeah, I wanna fight you.<br> - OK, there you go.<br> - On your back.<br> On your back, motherfucker!<br> Ow.<br> Cheers, you're the best.<br> You drunk?
