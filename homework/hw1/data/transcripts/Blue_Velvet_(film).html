I live near<br> you. I believe you know my father Tom?<br> - Beaumont's Hardware Store?<br> - Sure I do. I hear he's in the hospital.<br> - How's he doing?<br> - Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.<br> They're doing tests.<br> I was at the hospital this morning<br> and, coming home through<br> the field behind Vista,<br> I... found an ear.<br> You did? A human ear?<br> Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.<br> Yeah, that's right. Let's take a look at it.<br> Yes, that's a human ear, all right.<br> Let's see what the coroner makes of it.<br> Then I want you to show me<br> exactly where you found it.<br> All right.<br> We'll check the morgue records,<br> but I don't recall anything minus an ear.<br> The person may very well<br> still be alive somewhere.<br> What can you tell about the person<br> from the ear?<br> Once the tests are done, quite a lot.<br> Sex, blood type,<br> whether the ear came off a dead person.<br> Also, it looks like<br> the ear was cut off with scissors.<br> - I'm goin' out for a while.<br> - Do you want the car?<br> - No, I'm just gonna walk around.<br> - All right.<br> You're not going down by Lincoln,<br> are you?<br> No, just around the neighbourhood.<br> Don't worry.<br> OK, honey.<br> Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.<br> Is Detective Williams here?<br> - Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.<br> - Thanks.<br> Well, Jeffrey, you found<br> something very interesting.<br> Very interesting. I know you must<br> be curious to know more.<br> But I have to ask you not only<br> not to tell anybody about your find,<br> but also not to ask more about the case.<br> One day when it's all sewed up,<br> I'll let you know all the details.<br> Right now, though, I can't.<br> I understand.<br> I'm just real curious, like you said.<br> I was the same way myself<br> when I was your age.<br> - That's what got me into this business.<br> - Must be great.<br> It's horrible, too.<br> I'm sorry, Jeffrey.<br> That's the way it has to be.<br> Anyway, I know you do understand.<br> Sure.<br> - Thanks for the card for Dad.<br> - You're welcome. Nice to meet you.<br> You, too.<br> - Say hello to Sandy for me.<br> - We will.<br> - Good night, Jeffrey.<br> - Good night.<br> Are you the one that found the ear?<br> How did you know?<br> I just know, that's all.<br> - I remember you from Central.<br> - Are you a senior?<br> Yup.<br> - How is Central these days?<br> - Terrible.<br> - I don't know... Boring.<br> - What else is new!<br> So what are you doin' now?<br> I'm home from school.<br> My father's in the hospital.<br> - That's too bad.<br> - Yeah.<br> What do you know about the ear?<br> - Didn't Dad say not to talk about it?<br> - Yeah, but you brought it up.<br> You know anything?<br> I don't know much but bits<br> and pieces. I hear things.<br> Yeah?<br> - My room is above my father's office so...<br> - Above your father's office?<br> - So I heard a few things about the ear.<br> - Uh-huh. And?<br> Well... there are a couple of cases<br> I get mixed up on.<br> But one name that keeps coming up<br> is this woman singer.<br> She lives in an apartment<br> real close to your house.<br> Close to the field<br> where you found the ear.<br> It's a strange world, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where is this apartment?<br> It's really close by.<br> That's what's so creepy.<br> They had her under surveillance,<br> 'cept I don't know what they found out<br> cos she's not my dad's case. So...<br> I guess you gotta get<br> back home pretty soon, huh?<br> Not really. Why?<br> Well...<br> - You... wanna see the building.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Come on, I'll show you.<br> - OK.<br> Hey, baby. Hey, babe.<br> That's her building right there.<br> She lives on the seventh floor.<br> Come on.<br> So... what are you gonna do<br> now that you're home?<br> Help out at my father's hardware store.<br> They're giving me my own hours,<br> which is nice.<br> I used to know a kid that lived there.<br> Had the biggest tongue in the world.<br> What happened to him?<br> I don't know. He moved away.<br> All my old friends are gone.<br> - You know the chicken walk?<br> - What's that?<br> That's kind of interesting.<br> Coffee time.<br> Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?<br> They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,<br> where they've always been.<br> Hey, Ed, how many fingers?<br> Four.<br> I still don't know how you do that.<br> Now listen. You sure you don't<br> need me or this rig for a while?<br> If you wanna spray for bugs,<br> Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.<br> Okey-dokey, Double Ed.<br> - Oh, it's so good to have you back.<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> You hungry or thirsty, or both?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.<br> Wait just a minute.<br> Listen. Don't you guys<br> dare say anything to Mike.<br> - Sure.<br> - It's not what you think, OK?<br> - Promise?<br> - Whatever you say.<br> - I don't wanna cause trouble.<br> - I'm here, aren't I?<br> - He is nice-lookin'.<br> - Yeah.<br> You ever been to Arlene's?<br> Of course.<br> Now are you gonna tell me<br> why we're here?<br> There are opportunities in life<br> for gaining knowledge and experience.<br> Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.<br> I'll bet someone could learn a lot<br> by getting into that woman's apartment.<br> You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.<br> - Sneak into her apartment?<br> - Yeah.<br> Are you crazy?<br> Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.<br> This is givin' me the creeps.<br> Now just settle down.<br> I have a plan which I think will work.<br> There's very little for you to do,<br> but I do need your help.<br> Don't you even wanna hear the plan?<br> Tell me any plan you want, but it's not<br> going any further than this diner.<br> Sandy,<br> don't take that attitude.<br> All right. The first thing I need<br> is to get into her apartment<br> - And open a window to crawl into later.<br> - How are you gonna do that?<br> Right out in the car I happen to have<br> some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.<br> I will go to her apartment as a pest-control<br> man. I will spray her apartment.<br> You knock on the door, draw her attention<br> away from me, and I'll jimmy a window.<br> - And what do I say to her at the door?<br> - You will be a Jehovah's witness.<br> I have some Awake! magazines for you.<br> I don't need very much time,<br> just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?<br> I don't know.<br> I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,<br> but... actually doing it's too weird.<br> - It's too dangerous.<br> - Sandy, let's just try the first part.<br> No one will suspect us.<br> No one would think two people like us<br> would be crazy enough to do this.<br> You have a point there.<br> Give me at least three minutes.<br> I can stall if it's more, but I need time<br> to find a good window. All right?<br> All right.<br> Let's go.<br> Here I go.<br> Wait a minute. What's her name?<br> Oh, brother, Jeffrey.<br> Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.<br> Look on her mailbox<br> for the number, bright boy.<br> Thanks.<br> Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.<br> OK. Good luck.<br> Good luck yourself.<br> Three minutes. No sooner.<br> Yes? What is it?<br> Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.<br> - That stuff stinks.<br> - This is new stuff. There's no smell.<br> Good.<br> Just need to do the kitchen.<br> Grand Central Station.<br> It's only the bug man.<br> - That should do it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yeah. What happened?<br> I was about to go to the door<br> when that guy did it for me.<br> - Was it all right?<br> - Yes and no. Did you recognise him?<br> I only saw his back. I think<br> he went out a door at the end of the hall.<br> I didn't get a good look at him either,<br> but he sure looked at me.<br> I didn't have time to get a window,<br> but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?<br> Yeah, if they open the door.<br> Yeah.<br> So, what's next?<br> - Are you game for more?<br> - I owe you one since I goofed this one up.<br> You didn't goof it up.<br> But... you still owe me one.<br> I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.<br> It's Friday. Do you have a date?<br> Yeah. I do.<br> Well, that does that.<br> - You really wanna do this, don't you?<br> - I don't want you to get involved.<br> I do, but if something went wrong...<br> Like you said,<br> they may be involved in murder.<br> OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.<br> Just so the record<br> is kept straight, though,<br> I love Mike.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> First we'll have a really nice dinner. Try<br> to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.<br> I already know.<br> The Slow Club on Route 7.<br> Great. I'll pick you up about eight?<br> Don't pick me up.<br> My dad might think it's strange.<br> I'll walk over to your house.<br> I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?<br> You better get out<br> before someone sees us.<br> See ya!<br> Wait. Here's to an interesting<br> experience, huh?<br> I'll drink to that.<br> Man, I like Heineken!<br> You like Heineken?<br> - I never really had Heineken before.<br> - You never had Heineken before?<br> My dad drinks Bud.<br> - King of beers.<br> - Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.<br> She<br> Wore<br> Blue velvet<br> Bluer than velvet was the night<br> Softer than satin was the light<br> From the stars<br> She wore blue velvet<br> Bluer than velvet were her eyes<br> Shadows<br> Fall so blue<br> As lonely as a blue<br> Blue<br> Star<br> - Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.<br> - Why not?<br> Cos it's crazy... and dangerous.<br> - My God, I should have never told you.<br> - I'll be all right.<br> I don't think you should stay. I think you<br> should go home. Can you drive this car?<br> - Yeah, but I...<br> - Leave it in front of your house, OK?<br> OK.<br> I'll see ya tomorrow<br> and I'll tell ya how it went.<br> I don't wanna see you tomorrow.<br> - Mike's coming over.<br> - OK. Can I call you?<br> OK, yeah, call.<br> I hope you sneak out OK.<br> - I'm gonna wait here until she comes.<br> - Sandy...<br> I'm gonna honk four times.<br> I'll go one, two, three, four,<br> and then you'll hear it<br> - And you'll know she's on her way up.<br> - OK.<br> I don't know if you're<br> a detective or a pervert.<br> Well, that's for me to know<br> and you to find out.<br> See ya.<br> Bye.<br> Heineken.<br> I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.<br> Thank you, Jimmy.<br> See you tomorrow. Good night.<br> Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?<br> Frank, let me talk to him.<br> Please, Frank... sir.<br> I like to sing "Blue Velvet".<br> Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry.<br> Don!

Be with me, please.<br> Like a flame burning brightly<br> But when she left<br> Gone was the glow<br> Of<br> Blue velvet<br> But in my heart there'll always be<br> Precious and warm a memory<br> Through the years<br> And I still can see<br> Blue velvet<br> Through my tears<br> USA<br> Logs, logs, logs.

But it's interesting.<br> Number two.<br> I saw the Yellow Man come out<br> and meet a well-dressed man<br> carrying an alligator briefcase.<br> They went to a factory, stood on<br> a staircase and looked into the distance.<br> Now get this. In the distance,<br> there was a murder.<br> A drug dealer was shot to death<br> and a woman had her legs broken.<br> Jeffrey...<br> Then two guys told me the police would<br> find drugs in the dead dealer's place.<br> I can't believe what you're finding out.<br> Are you gonna continue with this?<br> Yeah.<br> Until when?<br> What are you gonna do with this?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> You're not going back to her apartment?<br> Yeah.<br> Jeffrey, why?<br> I'm seeing something<br> that was always hidden.<br> I'm involved in a mystery.<br> I'm in the middle of a mystery.<br> And it's all secret.<br> You like mysteries that much?<br> Yeah.<br> You're a mystery.<br> I like you...<br> very much.<br> Yeah?<br> Jeffrey, don't.
