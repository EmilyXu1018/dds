                        Ben...<br> Ben!<br> Where's he going? The champ must be crazy.<br> He's got a fight tomorrow night.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> I'll get him.<br> - Hiya, champ!<br> - How ya shake, champ?<br> - Okay, kid.<br> - It's Charlie Davis!<br> - Charlie!<br> - Hello, Ma.<br> Careful Charlie, you'll cut yourself.<br> What do you want, Charlie?<br> Ben died.<br> - When?<br> - Today. I had to come down anyway<br> for the fight tomorrow.<br> I couldn't sleep, Ma. I thought maybe I...<br> - Peg is sleeping here, Charlie.<br> - Oh.<br> I couldn't stand it up there, Ma.<br> After they took Ben away.<br> I couldn't sleep, so I came down.<br> I had to find a place where I could lie down.<br> You know, Ma.<br> You have to find a place...<br> I didn't mean all those things I said to Peg...You know that.<br> What's the matter? Don't you want me here?<br> The butcher was closed, but I got everything else from the grocer.<br> Peg!<br> Peg...Peg...<br> Go away, Charlie...Go away.<br> Hey, lay off of that!...I knew him when he was a kid in the poolroom. He used to beat everybody.<br> What a fighter!<br> You leaving, champ?<br> Oh, hello, Champ! She'll be through in a few minutes...<br> Can I check your coat?<br> - Hello, champ.<br> - Bourbon.<br> Chaser?<br> Hi, champ.<br> Hello, sweetie. Quinn's been going nuts. You've been every place in town but here.<br> Why didn't you come here first, Charlie ?<br> How does it look, Charlie, the night before the fight...3 a.m. and you loaded?<br> Come on, Alice, let's go.<br> Okay, champ.<br> Just on the nose, Davis.<br> All fat! Nightclub fat!<br> Whisky fat! 35-year-old fat!<br> - Too bad about Ben.<br> - Yeah.<br> - You in good shape tonight, Marlowe?<br> - Great shape.<br> - Two pounds under Davis.<br> - Think you're gonna lick him?<br> - I've licked everybody in the division.<br> Are you nervous?<br> Nervous? He's nervous! It took the Boxing Commission two years. It took every sportswriter two years...<br> - It took me two years to pressure Davis into this fight.<br> - In what round do you think you're gonna stop him?<br> I'll stop him in two if his legs hold out.<br> Look you, lay off the propaganda. Can't you keep this loud mouth shut?<br> I'm in charge of the muscles, not the brains.<br> Say...What eye are you using, champ, the good eye or the glass one?<br> Vince...go see what boxer's on.<br> That was great publicity, Charlie, smacking Marlowe this afternoon...<br> - I meant to hit him.<br> The kid was putting on an act to make it look good.<br> I could knock that Marlowe on his ear in two rounds.<br> What's wrong, Charlie ?<br> The books are all balanced. The bets are in. You bet your purse against yourself.<br> You gotta be business-like, Charlie...Just because the kid talks a little fresh...<br> Give me the tape, Quinn.<br> You still thinking about Ben, Charlie?<br> Everybody dies.<br> Ben, Shorty...even you.<br> - What's the point?<br> - No point, that's life.<br> You go in and just box that boy for 15 rounds, Charlie, like we agreed.<br> Nobody get hurt, nobody get knocked out. You'll lose by a clean decision.<br> You'll get your money and we're squared away.<br> You know the way the betting is, Charlie. The numbers are in.<br> Everything is addition or subtraction. The rest is conversation.<br> I still think I can knock that Marlowe on his ear in two rounds.<br> Maybe you could, Charlie. But the smart money is against it.<br> And you're smart.<br> It's a deal...It's a deal!<br> You gotta be business-like, Charlie...And businessmen have to keep their agreements.<br> Make it short then.<br> Get out of here.<br> I'm going down the drain...<br> everything down the drain.<br> All these years...everything down the drain...All these years...<br> And now The Iroquois Democratic Club of the 14th AD<br> has a big surprise for a very lucky young man.<br> The boy who won his first amateur bout in 1 minute and 12 seconds,<br> our own neighborhood champ, Charlie Davis!<br> Quiet, boys! Quiet!<br> Who's got the privilege of dancing a solo<br> with Miss Iroquois Democratic Club, 14 AD!<br> Come on, Charlie...Come on!<br> Take her around, Charlie, she won't bite you!<br> You can dance, can't you? Can you walk?<br> Come on, she's willing, like I am. Go ahead!<br> He's a ringer, a wrestler!<br> Now why ain't I young and lucky?<br> Okay friends, before we get lost in fun,<br> don't forget to vote for the people's choice, Jack Shelton,<br> the man who never said no to a friend.<br> Ever hear of the law of gravity?<br> - No...what's gravity?<br> - Sit up straight.<br> - Well, good night.<br> - Night.<br> I win.<br> Well, you're in better shape.<br> Depends on the point of view...<br> Well, good night.<br> - Aw, it's early yet.<br> - Why don't you go to a movie?<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Certainly.<br> Is your friend going to wait for you?<br> Hey!...Ouch!<br> My friend...<br> It don't look good!<br> - All right, but as soon as your friend leaves, you leave. Promise?<br> - Promise.<br> Say...What's your name?<br> Peg.<br> - Still the undefeated champ!<br> - Amateur!<br> - Irma?<br> - Yeah?<br> Don't you live alone?<br> - Are you decent?<br> - Not particularly. Bring him in.<br> Are you decent?<br> This is Irma.<br> She sculpts.<br> - I make statues.<br> - Oh.<br> And this is Charlie Davis, amateur boxing champion of the universe...<br> as of tonight!<br> - Really?<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> - Well...sit down, champ.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Take your coat and shirt off.<br> - What?<br> Like to pose for me?<br> No...sit down.<br> I've got a longshoreman posing for me now.<br> A longshoreman?<br> He's very graceful, too.<br> Anytime you'd like to be preserved for posterity, champ...<br> drop in to see me...Good night, champ.<br> - Peg.<br> - Irma.<br> Is she kidding?<br> - What do you do here?<br> - I paint.<br> Pictures.<br> I go to art school because I want to be a painter.<br> What about this Miss This and Miss That?<br> There's an agency which arranges these little jobs for me.<br> I get 25 dollars, and the crowd gets to whistle.<br> - What's with that accent?<br> - What accent?<br> The way you say "crowd", and "whistle"...<br> - Why, I talk that way.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, because...because I learned it that way.<br> - Where?<br> Oh...in Paris, Berlin, London, Montreal...<br> And you paint too?<br> - Well, paint me.<br> - Sure.<br> - Did your friend leave?<br> - ...Oh.<br> That character's still there...<br> Pull the shade up.<br> - What?<br> - That'll send him away.<br> Okay...<br> Should I take my coat off?<br> It makes no difference.<br> How's this?<br> Are you going to be professional prizefighter?<br> Or are you going to run for President?<br> I just want to be a success.<br> - You mean you want other people to think you're a success?<br> - Sure...sure.<br> Every man for himself.<br> - Ouch!<br> - It's time to go home now.<br> Good night...<br> - Can I see you again sometime?<br> - What for?<br> Just to see you...anything.<br> - Try sometime.<br> - Will you?<br> Try.<br> I don't get it, Peg.<br> Why should you want to see me?<br> Why do you want to see me?<br> Because you're beautiful and you're level...and you're different.<br> Oh Charlie, you're so innocent.<br> You know, when I went to school, I learned a poem.<br> It went:<br> "Tiger, tiger, burning bright<br> In the forest of the night,<br> "What immortal hand or eye<br> Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"<br> What's "symmetry"?<br> Well built.<br> After I showed him how to knock this guy out, we get this big feed, see?<br> - Yeah?<br> - And they bring this quail out.<br> - Yeah?<br> And then what happened, then what happened?<br> - Come on, come on!<br> - Finish the story!<br> - Well, She and Charlie begin to dance...<br> - Yeah?<br> And before you know it...Come here...<br> - She's inviting him up to her apartment.<br> - No kidding.<br> Charlie, perfect man of the world,<br> gives me the sign, see, and me...I blow.<br> Fellas...just like that...<br> - Charlie, very nonchalant...<br> - Hello, Charlie!<br> Well? Well?<br> What happened?<br> She draws pictures.<br> You mean she was drawing your picture?<br> Yeah! She's got a big room with big paintings and statues and all that kind of stuff. I'm going to see her again.<br> - She give you a diploma?<br> - Wise guy!<br> Let me see that.<br> - Look, she drew his picture!<br> - Hey, look! Fur!<br> - Doesn't look like you.<br> All right, all right...<br> - What are you getting sore about?<br> - I'm not sore...who's sore?<br> Hiya, Mr. Quinn!<br> He was at the fights.<br> - No kidding!<br> - Yeah! I saw him.<br> - You mean when I knocked that guy out?<br> - He was sitting right at the ringside.<br> - Gee.<br> - Come on!<br> - What for?<br> - Come on, don't be a dope! Hit him while you're hot!<br> - Okay.<br> I win.<br> Very strong! You see that, Charlie?<br> Like the fights tonight, Mr. Quinn?<br> So-so.<br> How'd you like that quick knockout Charlie made?<br> I've seen knockouts before.<br> Everybody said it was sensational!<br> You ever meet Charlie personally, Mr. Quinn?<br> You shoot.<br> - This is Charlie Davis.<br> - Hello.<br> How about you take in a hand? You know, set up a few money fights now? Charlie's on his way up.<br> Charlie's a great fighter, Mr. Quinn. He's got the natural stuff. He's got the style...<br> - A little training...<br> - So what?<br> So what? He won the amateurs!<br> So what? Kids win this and that every day. Thousands of them.<br> One out of a hundred fights professionally, one out of a thousand's worth watching,<br> one out of a million is worth coffee and donuts...Now tell your boy to get himself an honest job.<br> Nobody's asking you for coffee and donuts!<br> You see that, Mr. Quinn? He's a natural fighter, you got a champion!<br> Throw me the balls.<br> Hiya, Pop!<br> Good evening, Ma!<br> Good evening, champion.<br> We had a delegation tonight from the poolroom. They congratulated your parents.<br> Well...it's better to win than to lose.<br> Surely...And the other boy, you hurt him good, champion?<br> It's only a prizefight, Ma. It's a sport!<br> A fine sport...A fine sport, indeed!<br> Quinn will take you on. He'll teach you to be a professional fighter!<br> All we gotta do is raise ten or fifteen bucks for equipment.<br> We can dig up the dough, and...<br> Evening, Mrs. Davis...evening, Mr. Davis...<br> - I'll see you later, Charlie.<br> - Yeah.<br> So now you'll be a professional sport and make a living hitting people.<br> Knocking their teeth out, smashing their noses, breaking their heads in.<br> Sportsman, this is what you want?<br> All right, Anna, if we're closing up, let's close.<br> But instead we live in a jungle, so he can only be a wild animal.<br> Do you think I picked the East Side like Columbus picked America?<br> It was possible to buy the candy store with a small cash-down payment...<br> A fine investment.<br> Next door a speakeasy, across the street a poolroom...<br> Loafers on the corner, children like wolves...<br> Could I help it that J.P. Morgan refused to advance me credit?<br> I would have opened a fancy store on Fifth Avenue...<br> We could have lived at the Ritz, Charlie would be wearing a monocle...<br> You think I want to spend the rest of my life selling kids two-cent soda?<br> "Mr. Davis, give me a penny candy, Mr. Davis, give me a pack of cigarettes, mind the baby,<br> make mine raspberry!"...<br> Well not me, Ma! Understand, not me.<br> I don't want to end up like Pop.<br> Don't talk that way about your father.<br> Let the boy alone. He don't mean what he says.<br> I'll let him alone like you do, to fight in poolrooms, to hang around street corners...<br> - I want him to study to be something.<br> - I want to be a fighter!<br> So fight for something, not for money!<br> Charlie!<br> That's 10 dollars!<br> For your boxing equipment.<br> You don't have to discuss this with your mother.<br> Thanks, Pop!<br> They're bombing the speak!<br> They got the speakeasy.<br> Yeah, and they got the candy store, too!<br> Look at the front...All smashed in!<br> Pop...Pop!<br> Don't cry, Ma.<br> Don't cry.<br> Charlie, it's cold out...Why don't you come in and get a little warm?<br> - Thanks, I'm waiting for somebody.<br> - Okay...<br> - It's cold outside, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - She didn't come yet, huh?<br> - No.<br> Maybe she won't come.<br> She'll come...She'll come. That's wait I'm afraid of.<br> It's gonna be great! She and my mother...<br> - Well, if you're going with a girl...<br> - Who's going with a girl? I won't have a dime in a hundred years.<br> No unemployment for him.<br> All right, all right...Don't rub it in.<br> I got troubles of my own.<br> You and me both.<br> Look through the want ads. Maybe somebody died and you can carry the corpse.<br> How's business, Mr. Quinn?<br> Always pitching, huh, punk?<br> Why don't you talk to Charlie?<br> What for?<br> Well, he might listen to you. He ain't got a job...nothing.<br> It ain't my headache...He don't want to fight.<br> His old lady won't let him.<br> That never stopped anybody, kid. You know that. Charlie just doesn't have the drive, the fighting spirit.<br> How about Marino?<br> He stinks! But he's willing, that's half the racket.<br> Now look, stop dreaming, kid. You'll have to make a buck some other way.<br> - Let me see that form, will you, friend?<br> - Yeah, that Four Leaf Clover's following in...<br> Hey Marino, you were great in your last fight!<br> You know Marino, don't you, Charlie?<br> The real mutt. Couldn't even lick my kid brother.<br> Now lay off of that stuff, Shorty.<br> - He even got knocked out last week, but he still got plenty of dough in his pockets.<br> - And that was the ringer.<br> How much do you get when you lose?<br> You hear that, Charlie?<br> He don't have to take his girl walking on the streets...<br> - Jacks.<br> - Queens.<br> - Let me see the cards.<br> - You don't trust me, eh?<br> See what I mean? And your boy don't get 50 bucks this time.<br> You just burned up my cigar money, Charlie.<br> I bet you'd be willing to pay expenses now, wouldn't you?<br> - You know, you're a pretty cute kid! I oughta take a sock at you!<br> - Charlie...Charlie!<br> - That's a lot of dough, Charlie.<br> - There's Peg! - Get my hat, will you? Peg! Oh, Peg!<br> She left her lipstick on you, Charlie.<br> Did that other girl show you her paintings?<br> Oh. I ran into a door...Let's take a walk around the block.<br> What for?<br> My mother's been talking like I was bringing you around for approval or something.<br> - I don't want to embarrass you, and make you sore...<br> - I won't be sore.<br> Look Charlie, you can't call it off. Just tell her you like long engagements.<br> Is this a proposal?<br> From Mama! She'll say:<br> "And where do you come from, Miss Born?"<br> And where do you come from, Miss Born?<br> She told you, Ma.<br> I heard Miss Born, Charlie.<br> - Call me Peg, Mrs. Davis. My friends call me Peg.<br> - Thank you, Peg.<br> I mean where did you come from in this country?<br> Highlandtown. My father was a druggist there.<br> A professional man? Very nice...<br> Charlie's father's brother was a teacher. Very smart.<br> Charlie's going to night school. He told you?<br> Yes, I think it's an excellent idea.<br> - And you came to New York to study?<br> - I want to be a painter.<br> - Charlie made me bring this.<br> - Talented, huh?<br> Very talented.<br> No, thank you!<br> And you live in Greenwich Village?<br> - Yes.<br> It must be very lonely for a girl all alone. You live alone?<br> With a friend. She makes statues.<br> Wonderful. Your father's a druggist, a professional man, and you're an artist.<br> Peg...Have another cookie, they're homemade!<br> ..And Shorty?<br> You know, Shorty lives on the same block. He's got ten brothers and sisters.<br> And seven of them are out of work!<br> Times are very hard. It's not easy for a boy to get started nowadays.<br> But if his friends encourage him, if he goes to school and gets an education,<br> - if he makes sacrifices...<br> - He'll end up wearing glasses, and still broke.<br> We're very poor, Mrs. Davis. We've always been poor.<br> My father scrimped and scraped, and<br> when Prohibition came, he sold some of the bonded medicinal whisky, you know? Without prescription?<br> - And what happened?<br> - They arrested him and fined him.<br> I got fed up anyway, so I came to New York.<br> We're nothing fancy.<br> - Did Charlie show you his medal?<br> - No.<br> He won it at basketball. The very best in the whole school!<br> - Oh, Ma...<br> - Show her, show her!<br> Now don't be bashful, Charlie. Peg wants to see it!<br> Mrs. Davis? May I come in?<br> I heard your voices in the kitchen.<br> I'm Miss Tedder.<br> - Oh. Would you come in here please?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> I'm terribly sorry to interrupt your dinner, but it's hurry hurry hurry...<br> So many cases and so few people. And so little cooperation.<br> I won't be long. I have your letter here...<br> - Mrs. Anna Davis, is that right?<br> - Yes, I'm Anna Davis.<br> And now, just a form to make a proper check.<br> Race : White. Religion : Jewish.<br> Nationality : American.<br> Is this your boy?<br> I'm Charlie Davis.<br> Are you unemployed?<br> Have you got a job for me?<br> - Have you tried?<br> - He tried.<br> All these questions must be answered, I'm sorry.<br> Have you tried to get a job, Mrs. Davis?<br> Would I be asking for a loan from charity if I could find work?<br> It isn't personal, we're supposed to ask.<br> Have you any resources, any jewelry?<br> She has her wedding ring!<br> We don't ask our clients to sell their wedding rings...<br> I wish you'd understand, I have to ask these questions.<br> Charlie, please, go in the other room!<br> Is this furniture yours?<br> Get out of here!<br> Charlie, I won't have you talking like this.<br> Get out of here! Get out of here!<br> We have to ask questions if we're going to help.<br> We don't want any help. Tell them we're dead! We don't want any help!<br> I did it to buy myself fancy clothes? Fool!<br> It's for you! To learn, to get an education, to make something of yourself!<br> Shorty, get me that fight from Quinn. I want money, do you understand? Money. Money!<br> I forbid it. You'd better buy a gun and shoot yourself!<br> You need money to buy a gun!<br> Charlie!<br> It's cold.<br> I don't want any handouts.<br> You think I like the idea of waiting around for the whole world to make up its mind what to do with me?<br> My mother don't understand.<br> What is it you want to do?<br> There's only one thing I know how to do: Fight.<br> If you want to fight, fight.<br> And it's all right with you?<br> Anything you want is all right with me. I love you, Charlie.<br> I'll be quick!<br> - Tiger, tiger...<br> - Yeah, that's right!<br> I got claws!<br> But not for you, Peg...Not for you.<br> - Quinn!<br> - Hello, Shorty!<br> - What you doing up here? Couldn't you wait for Grand Central?<br> - Got big news!<br> - Hey, Quinn!<br> - Hello, Boy!<br> - Gee, that cigar stinks!<br> - Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!<br> Now you got that news...you got that fight for me?<br> - Well I don't know...<br> - Come on, tell me about it!<br> Hey...hey...hey...the hat's here!<br> - How do you like the new coat?<br> - I like the tie, Charlie!<br> Never mind that. Come on, give us the dope, will you?<br> We've got some business arrangements to take care of first, Charlie.<br> With who? Roberts?<br> Who else? Nobody fights the championship for anything unless Roberts gets cut in...You know that.<br> He's got the dough, the real estate, everything. The business.<br> What does Roberts want, Quinn?<br> Nothing much.<br> Only Charlie.<br> He'll be cutting you to pieces, Charlie.<br> That only means more dough cut more ways.<br> A bigger pie, more slices, more to eat for everybody!<br> And Roberts will be telling us what and when.<br> So what? Everyone's been telling us what and when!<br> The guy who owned the arena, the guy who owned the fighter, the guy who owned the books...<br> Cheap mobsters, gangsters, guys who own nothing.<br> We've been fighting for peanuts and eating them! Right?<br> - Right.<br> You know you can't get a fight in New York without Roberts' say-so. Right?<br> - Right.<br> Right. Okay, Quinn, make the deal.<br> I'll be the champ, then I'll give the orders. I'll say what and when.<br> You can tell us what and when, but you can't tell Roberts.<br> But the champ can.<br> Not if he gives away his right arm!<br> Aw, you made me cut myself!<br> It's my arm, isn't it?<br> - Gee, you're lighter!<br> - You're stronger.<br> Boy, you feel good!<br> Hey, who's that?<br> - I'm Victor. Mr. Quinn employed me.<br> - Doing what?<br> - It's the butler!...Hello, Peg.<br> - Hello, Shorty.<br> - You look beautiful.<br> - You took the words out of my mouth! How's your job?<br> Wonderful! I'm third assistant designer now...<br> - Where do the bags go?<br> - In there.<br> You miss me?<br> - It's been a long year, Charlie.<br> - Yeah.<br> A lonely year.<br> I missed you too.<br> - Hey, easy!<br> - What's the matter?<br> The guy had a head like a rock.<br> That'll be all right.<br> - And this?<br> - Chicago.<br> - And this?<br> - Philadelphia.<br> - And this?<br> - Boston.<br> You get something every time, but it's worth it.<br> As long as you win.<br> Look! Lots of money, lots of clothes...<br> Lots of everything.<br> Hey, Shorty...Shorty!<br> What about the reservations, the tickets for tonight?<br> - Why, I want to talk to you about that...<br> - How about a drink? - Yes, sir.<br> It's early in the morning yet, Charlie, we haven't said hello.<br> Hello, morning, noon or night, what's the difference how you cut up the 24 hours?<br> Well, what do you know!<br> The only trouble is Peg's picture's on the other side.<br> - We'll find another wall that stands still.<br> - Sure.<br> Look, it's even got a little sink!<br> Bourbon, scotch, like milk, like cream!<br> What'll you have, folks? Just like the candy store!<br> Want a two-cent soda, Peg?<br> - Shorty, I thought I told you...<br> - Charlie, I'd like to...<br> - Come on, come on, we got no secrets here!<br> - I need some money.<br> - What do you mean, you need money? I thought I gave you some in Detroit.<br> - That was Detroit.<br> All the time he needs money! Well, what do you do with it?<br> I steal it! I go through your pockets every night to see if there's any left to send to your old lady!<br> Get the reservations!<br> You, bring my bags in!<br> - What's wrong, Shorty?<br> - Nothing, nothing...<br> Come on, Shorty...Not with me.<br> He's restless, he's had a lot of fights, he's all wound up, like a guy on a jag.<br> Peg, you've got to...<br> What have I got to?<br> You two still getting married?<br> Well, I haven't had time to say no!<br> Then get married right away.<br> - Why, have I got a rival?<br> - Yeah, money!<br> You know what Charlie is, what they're making him? A money machine.<br> Like gold mines, oil wells, ten percent of the U.S. Mint!<br> They're cutting him up a million ways!<br> You're the only one left, Peg, the only one. He won't listen to me.<br> If you don't hold onto him, it's Goodbye, Charlie Davis.<br> Marry him, Peg, but do it now, now!<br> How do you like this coat? Handmade! Shorty's got one like this, too.<br> Come on, honey, we're gonna burn up the town! We'll rob the stores!<br> Wait a minute, wait a minute, I forgot. Oh, yeah...Mom...Mom is coming up.<br> Would you do me a favor, Shorty, the old lady's coming up. Keep her happy. Make with the jokes!<br> - Where'll you be?<br> - On the town!<br> - Quinn?<br> - Arnold...<br> What did you decide, Arnold?<br> The champ and I talked it over. We owe you...<br> - about 40 grand.<br> - Exactly 40 grand.<br> And we figure if we can hold the title for six months or more, we could pick up some easy money.<br> You know...making appearances, and...<br> The champ hasn't fought a real match in two years, Arnold. That costs money. No gates.<br> We waited for a real contender. He's here!<br> I know.<br> It's a business, Arnold. We get one fight now, another in six months.<br> It's money at the gate...and the betting!<br> Besides, I been carrying you and your boy.<br> Debts have to be paid or it wouldn't be business.<br> I guess you're right, Mr. Roberts.<br> Too bad about Ben getting hurt in that last fight. I liked Ben, he was a real fighter.<br> - Hard luck.<br> - Accidents happen.<br> Let them happen to other people!<br> After Ben's head cracked into that post, I wanted to die.<br> It's still there...the blood clot.<br> Doctors say no more fights.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> I told you...get your boy in the ring.<br> It's up to you, Ben.<br> If you say no...no.<br> If it's no, I want the money right away!<br> And I hold you responsible, Arnold!<br> People don't count with you, do they, Mr. Roberts?<br> You've been square with me, Arnold. I'll fight Davis.<br> Okay, Mr. Roberts.<br> - In two months.<br> - In two months.<br> But we agree it's for a decision...No slugging!<br> I don't want my champ killed, Mr. Roberts.<br> Nobody's gonna get killed!<br> Thank you, Mr. Roberts...Thank you!<br> - Have a good cigar, Quinn. For the new champ.<br> - Thanks, Mr. Roberts!<br> Too bad about Ben's head...he was a great fighter.<br> I like fighters, Quinn, better than horses.<br> But you gotta look out for business.<br> So we don't tell Charlie anything about this. Let him go into the fight and knock Ben out.<br> But Ben's sick, Mr. Roberts. Charlie might kill him!<br> The crowd likes a killer, and Charlie's a hard fighter.<br> - It'd look fixed if he takes it easy.<br> - I know, Mr. Roberts.<br> So wipe your nose and forget the whole thing!<br> Where's your boy? I asked you to bring him down.<br> He said you'd know where to find him.<br> - Fresh kid, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'll see him.<br> - Why don't you freshen your drink, Quinn?<br> - It tastes all right.<br> Lay off in front of the old lady, will you?<br> If you're sleepy, why don't you go home?<br> I'm not sleepy, I'm just thinking.<br> Don't tell me.<br> It's getting kind of late, Mrs. Davis.<br> Oh I've waited, I'll wait, Shorty. I wouldn't want to disappoint Charlie.<br> I'm waiting for Charlie, too.<br> Quinn promised me...It's lucky to meet lucky people.<br> You're a lucky woman, Mrs. Davis!<br> You think so, in what way?<br> Your son's going to be champ. And that means he's gonna be rich.<br> And that means you're gonna be rich.<br> I'm beautiful, why should I want to be rich?<br> - Why, hello!<br> - Ma!<br> - Charlie...How are you?<br> - Fine...You look wonderful.<br> - Let me look, let me see...<br> - Well, I haven't changed, and neither have you.<br> How do you like everything?<br> Wonderful.<br> I'm sorry we kept you waiting, but Peg and I, we've been on the town.<br> My fault, Mrs. Davis...my fault, everyone.<br> We danced and danced and Charlie just couldn't get me home.<br> Look at my dress, we robbed the stores!<br> And what do you think of my wedding present?<br> Yeah, we're gonna get married, right away! We decided this afternoon!<br> Now I am rich!<br> Getting married, that's great! Peg, that makes me feel fine!<br> - Look now, Shorty, that's enough!<br> - It sure is wonderful!<br> It's been such a night! Such a day!<br> Did you ever drink an oceanful of champagne?<br> Every place we went, there were millions of people,<br> and every one an intimate, personal friend of Charlie's.<br> And every place we went, there was another party, and more champagne!<br> And Charlie was the king, and I was...Charlie's girl!<br> And you're Charlie's mother, and you're Charlie's manager...<br> and you're Charlie's friend, and...<br> Who are you?<br> I'm nobody.<br> Don't sulk...We're all nobody.<br> You know who nobody is?<br> Nobody is anybody who belongs to somebody.<br> So if you belong to nobody, you're somebody.<br> Understand?<br> I'm sorry...This is Alice, Charlie, she's a friend of mine. She sings in a nightclub.<br> - Pleased to meet you, Charlie.<br> - Hello.<br> - And Miss Born?<br> - Hello.<br> - Could I try it on?<br> - It's all yours!<br> - Well, when's the wedding?<br> - Right away! - Good, good!<br> We'll invite the whole neighborhood. You wanna have it uptown or downtown?<br> - Uptown.<br> - Downtown.<br> Anyplace, as long as it's legal!<br> Gee...soft like baby skin.<br> I bet it cost a lot of dough!<br> Too rich for your blood.<br> Probably Roberts.<br> Hello, Mr. Roberts, we've been waiting for you.<br> Who asked you to wait?<br> - I'm Roberts...You're Charlie Davis.<br> - Yeah...Pleased to meet you, Mr. Roberts.<br> - This is my mother.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Roberts.<br> And this is my girl. We're gonna get married.<br> I just bought her a mink coat for a wedding present.<br> And...who's this?<br> That's my friend, Shorty.<br> - How about a drink, Mr. Roberts?<br> - Never touch it.<br> - How do you like the layout?<br> - Nice.<br> We've got a wonderful view...you can see the whole park from here.<br> - What's on your mind, Roberts?<br> - Oh...a social call.<br> A social call, huh?<br> What kind of a deal did you cook up with Quinn?<br> Lay off, Shorty!<br> Who did you say this was?<br> - That's my friend.<br> - For how much?<br> Ten percent.<br> Good evening, friend.<br> Good evening, partner.<br> Watch your arm, Charlie!<br> I told you it was my arm, didn't I?<br> Well...can we talk?<br> Yeah...who's this?<br> He's with me.<br> She's with me.<br> We have to get straightened out on this deal, Charlie.<br> - I thought you arranged that with Quinn?<br> - I don't talk money with Quinn.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I only make one kind of deal, Charlie, from now until the time you retire: 50 percent.<br> Quinn gets 30 percent, Shorty gets 10 percent and I get 60.<br> You want a crack at the title, don't you, Charlie?<br> We start fresh...You're a fresh young kid, so we start fresh.<br> There's always 100 percent.<br> You take 50 and I take 50.<br> Well, what about Quinn?<br> He's your manager. We both need him. You give him 5 percent and I'll give him 5 percent.<br> What about Shorty?<br> I don't ask you what you give your mother, Charlie, or your girl.<br> You want Shorty for laughs, give him the 10 percent. I pay my expenses, you pay yours.<br> Shorty gets 10 percent.<br> I told you I only make one kind of deal, Charlie.<br> This way you fight for the championship right away.<br> Okay...I'll take care of Shorty myself.<br> But...don't say anything about it, huh?<br> He's your friend.<br> You're my partner.<br> It's a deal!<br> Well what about me, Mr. Roberts? What percent do I get?<br> After all, I made him what he is, because I told him to fight.<br> In my business, there's only 100 percent.<br> - I'd like to say good night to your mother, Charlie.<br> - Oh yeah, sure...Ma!<br> Mr. Roberts would like to say good night.<br> I was awful glad to meet you, Mrs. Davis. You're a lucky woman to have a boy like Charlie.<br> He's going to make a lot of money...enough for everybody.<br> No more candy store for you. It's a lot nicer, ain't it?<br> Here...I almost forgot.<br> - What's this?<br> - Just a little on account, Charlie...I know you must be running short.<br> Good night, Mrs. Davis.<br> By the way, Charlie...You want to start training right away. The fight goes on in two months, you know.<br> Oh, it can't be too soon for me!<br> - Oh, and take a tip, kid...<br> - What's that?<br> Postpone the wedding bells.<br> Keep your mind on the fight.<br> Good night, Charlie's girl.<br> Very nice coat!<br> Remember, after mink comes sable.<br> - See you, Charlie.<br> - Good night.<br> Shorty, we got a lot of work to do...<br> I want you to set up that training camp...<br> Get ahold of Quinn...tell him to get me the best sparring partners in town.<br> - When do you want to start?<br> - You heard him...right away.<br> - Then you're not going to get married?<br> - You aren't going to get married?<br> Why, sure we're going to get married, but it'll wait.<br> Why can't the fight wait?<br> Ma, you can't do a thing like that! Explain it to her, will you, Shorty?<br> Charlie is absolutely right, Mrs. Davis. You can't postpone a fight. We could wait.<br> Why can't we drive up to Greenwich tonight? You can get married right away!<br> No Shorty, we'll wait.<br> That's my baby!<br> And you know what else, Ma?<br> I think you ought to get rid of the candy store and come and live here in a decent place.<br> I live in a decent place, Charlie.<br> Yeah, and it's paid for.<br> Sure...By who?<br> Not by Roberts!<br> What's the difference? What are you beefing about? It's money, ain't it?<br> You get it Peg, don't you?<br> Yeah, I get it.<br> What's the matter, Charlie?<br> You ought to keep walking him around...I don't want him to cool off.<br> I've been thinking Charlie...you've been working too hard.<br> Why don't you take a few days off and go to the city and see Peg?<br> Ah, I feel fine.<br> The last few weeks get kinda tough, don't they, Charlie?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm beginning to feel a strain myself.<br> You're overtrained.<br> So are you.<br> Maybe.<br> Awfully edgy.<br> You don't want to overdo it.<br> Neither do you.<br> What have I got to lose?<br> What have you got to win?<br> Everything.<br> Time, Charlie.<br> When are you going back to the city?<br> No hurry...The club doesn't open for another week.<br> Maybe you need a week to get ready.<br> I don't think so. I'm beginning to like it up here. I think I'll stay.<br> - Now listen, Alice...<br> - No, you listen to me.<br> Don't forget, you made me come up here.<br> Yeah, I'd like to see you get ahead, Alice.<br> What did you ever do about it?<br> Nothing, I never done anything about it.<br> You done everything about it.<br> - A job in a nightclub...<br> - That lousy job?<br> - The clothes you're wearing...<br> - You want them back? I'll give them back to you in spades!<br> Take it easy, will you?<br> You can't take that, can you?<br> No, I guess I can't.<br> From me to you, a word of advice...<br> People shouldn't be too ambitious at first.<br> You drive too fast...you break your neck!<br> Kill him, Charlie. Kill him!<br> Kill him, Charlie. Kill him!...Kill him, Charlie!<br> We'll get him down to the hospital...Make some xrays...<br> - I'll call an ambulance.<br> - He's not gonna live.<br> We'll see.<br> You must have hit him awful hard.<br> Anything I can do...Anything! Any money...<br> It'll be all right.<br> He won't be all right, you know that!<br> Take it easy, Arnold!<br> Go ahead, Charlie, everybody'll be waiting. I'll clean up here.<br> Go ahead, Quinn. Shorty, keep the champagne cold.<br> - Come on, Charlie.<br> - Mr. Arnold...<br> If there's anything I can do, just say the word...Anything!<br> - Come on, Shorty...<br> - I'll stick around...Drive down to the hospital with him.<br> That's a good idea.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - Okay.<br> Run along, Shorty. I'll take care of everything here.<br> You promised to have Davis take it easy. Look at him!<br> Maybe he'll die.<br> - You better beat it, Shorty.<br> - What for?<br> Who promised to take care of what?<br> Have it your way.<br> - You got any complaints?<br> - Me? I got no complaints.<br> He got complaints. Maybe he'll die.<br> Everybody dies!<br> You knew Ben had the blood clot in the brain! You promised him...<br> What do you want, a few grand more? You got it.<br> - Anything on your mind, Shorty?<br> - Plenty.<br> Spill it.<br> I don't like being your partner, Roberts...I'm out.<br> And I think after tonight, Charlie'll be out too.<br> You're a little behind the times, Shorty. We're not partners, you were out already.<br> Whatever you get, you get from Charlie.<br> - He's giving you a handout. Didn't he tell you?<br> - No.<br> Check it.<br> Send me the hospital bills.<br> - Thanks, champ!<br> - Oh wait, you can't do that!<br> Congratulations champ, it was a wonderful fight.<br> Hey, Charlie, throw me those gloves!<br> - Was it a tough go, Charlie?<br> - He wouldn't go down, he was like a rock!<br> Who's sitting here, you or him?<br> That's right, that's right...You saw him, Peg, you saw him!<br> Yes, I saw him, Charlie, I saw him.<br> There's Shorty, Charlie!<br> Shorty! Hey, Shorty!<br> We're kings of the world, Shorty!<br> - Aren't you going to join us, Shorty?<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> - What's the matter?<br> You didn't win the title, Charlie!<br> Ben was double-crossed. They promised him an easy go.<br> Where do you get that stuff? Who promised who?<br> Ben was sick...He had a blood clot, and they all knew!<br> - A blood clot?...You didn't know that, Charlie, did you?<br> - No, I didn't...!<br> It's the old alibi, champ...You'll get used to it.<br> Come on, let's sit down everybody and celebrate.<br> - What's the matter, Shorty? Don't you think I beat him square?<br> - You beat him foul!<br> Ask Quinn, ask Roberts.<br> I don't like partners like Roberts, Charlie...it's rotten enough without them. Tell him he's out!<br> What are you talking about, Shorty? Are you crazy? You want to make trouble? You can't believe everything you hear.<br> Can I believe Roberts?<br> He told me to check with you.<br> He said I was out.<br> Am I out?<br> Or are you going to keep giving me the 10 percent for old times' sake?<br> - Yes.<br> - I had to tell him, champ...<br> There's only room for one in the driver's seat, and that's you!<br> Sure, what's the difference? We won, didn't we? That's what we wanted!<br> We didn't win. He won!<br> Come on, let's sit down. We'll talk about it some other time.<br> We're going to talk about it right now!<br> That's right...now's the time, now!<br> It's not enough to be great, Charlie. I tried to tell you in Philly. I tried to tell you in L.A. we're infested with rats!<br> He's not just a kid who can fight, he's money!<br> And people want money so bad they make it stink, and they make you stink!<br> If you don't like the racket, Shorty, you can always quit.<br> I quit before I ever came in here.<br> And if he has any sense left, he'll do the same!<br> I'm through and you can keep your pension.<br> Come on, Shorty...Let's all relax. Come on...<br> Shorty...Shorty!<br> Don't run out on me. Don't leave me alone. Because I can't do it all by myself.<br> Now remember, long ago he came to us and asked us, and we said:<br> "It's all right, Charlie, go ahead."<br> Now we've got to help him!<br> Nobody can help him.<br> He's got to help himself.<br> Shorty!<br> Charlie!<br> Charlie, your hands, look!<br> We all know you can fight.<br> Thanks, friend!<br> Shorty, you're hurt!<br> - I'm all right...take care of Charlie.<br> - Come on, Shorty.<br> Charlie, Shorty's hurt.<br> Shorty!<br> I tell you he walked right into it! He didn't even look where he was going.<br> It's too late!<br> What's the matter...You lose your key?<br> No. I'd like to have a cigarette, if you don't mind.<br> If one could only say, Charlie...<br> that it started here...or there...<br> But we're in something horrible and we've got to get out.<br> Well what can I do? Go back to the candy store?<br> It was an accident.<br> Only the dying, nothing else?<br> It was all inevitable.<br> You must quit.<br> It took a long time, Peg!<br> Rotten and hard and tough.<br> Now I'm a champ.<br> Now it's gonna be easy.<br> I can't stop now...I can't throw it all away.<br> It's what we wanted.<br> But, Charlie...we can't live with these people! I couldn't bear it.<br> You won't have to see them, or meet them again.<br> We'll live fine...I'll make the money.<br> I'll look after Ben...Believe me, I'll do everything I can!<br> But I can't start again.<br> From what? With what?<br> But Charlie...you'll have to start again with nothing anyway someday.<br> Only it'll be worse.<br> You'll be like Ben.<br> I'm too smart for that.<br> It's nothing to argue, Charlie!<br> I can't live this way.<br> You'll stop now.<br> Or I'll stop.<br> But that's not fair!<br> Was it fair for Shorty to die?<br> It was an accident!<br> And for Ben to fight with a blood clot?<br> I didn't know.<br> Charlie...one way or the other.<br> But I'm the champ!<br> You mean Roberts is.<br> Charlie...<br> I can't marry you.<br> That would just mean marrying him.<br> Go on, take the money...Take it!<br> Then...how about working with me?<br> It's not charity...I need someone.<br> Someone I can trust.<br> Okay, Charlie. Okay!<br> Not this time, Charlie.<br> What's the matter?<br> You know I'm good for the money.<br> Only if you fight!<br> - So I'll fight.<br> - And it's gotta be Marlowe!<br> Leave the door open, you dope!<br> Are you crazy coming in here in front of everybody?<br> It's a gym...People come and go here.<br> Besides, I'm an admirer of yours...I like to watch you train.<br> - So you're all set for the Marlowe match?<br> - Yeah, we're all set.<br> That's great...The odds are 2 to 1 for you to win. That's a lot of dough...<br> if you bet on Marlowe.<br> I ain't handing no title over to any kid!<br> I can beat him.<br> Betting on yourself to win, Charlie?<br> I didn't think you were punch-drunk yet...<br> - I think I can beat him.<br> - You're not thinking, Charlie...you're dreaming.<br> It's only natural after all these years of living good.<br> A fight now and then, the dough rolling in...and the dough rolling out.<br> You begin to dream this can go on forever.<br> When I lose the championship, they'll have to carry me out.<br> This gym is full of guys who were carried out.<br> Mr. Roberts is right, Charlie.<br> You'd like to see me take a dive, wouldn't you?<br> No...why should I? You mean money in the bank to me...<br> But facts are facts, Charlie.<br> - Yeah?<br> - How much of my money have you got in the bank, Quinn?<br> How much you got, Charlie?<br> There's 60 grand in there...You wanna count it?<br> I'm good at figures, Charlie...it'll add up to a fortune.<br> Besides, you don't like fighting anymore...You like living too much.<br> So why not live the easy life?<br> - Maybe open a caf with this singer, with this...what's her name...<br> - Alice!<br> - Yeah, Alice.<br> - You punch the cash register instead of getting punched.<br> You got a million friends, Charlie...You can't miss!<br> All right, Charlie...Let's stop being nice to each other.<br> We agreed to make a killing on this fight months ago.<br> You're into me for a lot of dough!<br> I made my arrangements with Marlowe, and a lot of other people.<br> Nobody backs out now.<br> That's the way it is.<br> Besides, a lot of guys think Marlowe can beat you on the square.<br> I don't take no dive for nobody...What do you think I am, a tanker?<br> Who's asking you to take a dive?<br> - 15 rounds to a decision?<br> - That's right.<br> When you get ready to bet that dough, Charlie...<br> see that you give it to me to bet for you.<br> I'll get you a few extra points!<br> How's the head, Ben?<br> It's still on, Mr. Roberts...<br> no thanks to you.<br> Are you still sore?<br> I should have done something for you, Ben!<br> I like being Charlie's trainer.<br> Here's a little something to sweeten the past...<br> I don't take blood money, Mr. Roberts.<br> Mine or anybody else's.<br> You only have to bend down to pick it up, Ben!<br> Hey...take it easy, Ben! You mustn't get excited.<br> It's just the pressure, Charlie.<br> The last couple of weeks, I've been fighting my head all the time.<br> We've got to get you a real examination, Ben!<br> Yeah, after the fight.<br> - Are you all right now?<br> - Yeah, I'm all right.<br> Ben...Take the money, Ben!<br> It's not like people. It's got no memory. It don't think!<br> Did you sell the fight, Charlie?<br> Are you crazy?<br> I'll see you up in camp. Take it easy.<br> Leave the doors open, Quinn, what'll people think?<br> You care?<br> You sure you're not worried?<br> I got nothing to be worried about.<br> As long as you can keep your mind on the dough...<br> To the money!<br> Are you gonna bet?<br> If I have to beg, borrow and steal, I'm gonna bet this fight.<br> Just remember baby...I told you about it.<br> You get in on a big fix once in a lifetime...And after it's over?<br> No problem...The boy's gonna make a snootful of dough!<br> He'll go through it in a year with your help.<br> That gives me a year, Quinn. What about you?<br> I'll find myself another mug. They come and they go but I stay.<br> That's the reason you should listen to me, baby!<br> Don't you ever get tired?<br> No...I got no time for pride!<br> He could have had the whole world, so he leaned over sideways and grabbed you!<br> Nobody grabbed me, I grabbed him!<br> Sure, baby, sure! All love in the yard wide. But every time he's low-down,<br> he's gone to Peg. He's not gonna feel so high after this fight.<br> I don't care where his heart is, only the money!<br> What about me, how I feel?<br> Don't romance me, Quinn. You're getting old.<br> You could use a new paint job yourself.<br> And I know where to get it.<br> Hey Charlie, who you hiding?<br> How about going out, cutie?<br> Charlie, take it easy!<br> Early delivery today.<br> But Charlie...come in.<br> - Trouble?<br> - No...no.<br> I better make some coffee, you look as if you need some.<br> Isn't this a trifle early for you?<br> No, I got up early this morning.<br> That is, I didn't get to sleep.<br> Oh? Celebrating the Marlowe match?<br> I tried to.<br> I thought you skipped all the places in the papers that mentioned my name.<br> On the contrary, I read about you religiously.<br> Orange juice?<br> Sure.<br> Yes, I've been promoted since you were last here.<br> I'm a fully fledged designer now.<br> That's great.<br> well, good health!<br> What is it this time, Charlie?<br> Last time you came it was because you were bored.<br> And the year before, you were lonely...<br> Once it was your birthday, twice it was mine...<br> What's the occasion now?<br> I don't understand.<br> I worked very late last night so I'm not very bright this morning, but I'll try and I'll...<br> What do you want?<br> Advice? Comfort? Recriminations...<br> I brought this, too.<br> It doesn't look like me. It's bad technique.<br> Isn't this your problem?<br> Don't you want it anymore?<br> No.<br> I just don't understand...<br> Now...I'm still half asleep...<br> If you don't want it anymore, why return it after all these years?<br> I want you.<br> Well here I am, Charlie.<br> Peg...I'm scared...so low-down, I...<br> I had to see, I wanted to know, I had to find out, once and for all, I had to know!<br> And we won't be broke...it's my last fight...<br> Look, I got 60 grand and more to come and I'll...<br> Don't tell me what you can get me, don't tell me what you can buy.<br> You've got nothing to buy.<br> I...I said all that once before, didn't I?<br> Don't talk, Charlie. Just sit.<br> Because you'll only start saying those things you've learned to say.<br> Not what you once were.<br> What you are.<br> Ever since Irma left, it runs over!<br> Irma! Where is she?<br> In Texas.<br> Texas? Doing what?<br> She's married.<br> She married the first guy that ever bought a statue from her!<br> Is she happy?<br> Oh, deliriously!<br> It all happened on a rainy afternoon.<br> Things happen that way. Sometimes you...you wait very long for happiness.<br> And sometimes you fall over it just before you learn to walk.<br> She just walked it all...Or jumping!<br> I must be jumping, I can't think why.<br> I think I'm ill, I'm running a high...<br> What am I talking about, do you know?<br> Do you know what it's like to love, and be alone?<br> Don't poke it...pat it gently.<br> Is it spoiled?<br> - No, no...<br> I'm trying to be useful.<br> Then get me a saucer.<br> There...Let the expert have a taste.<br> One pretty woman in the family's enough.<br> More.<br> You approve?<br> You know, that's a taste that never leaves your mouth!<br> The expert approves!<br> Say, I meant to ask you...What did the old lady say when I told you this was my last fight?<br> She cried.<br> And then she said the most beautiful thing I've ever heard in my life.<br> - What?<br> She said she didn't think that at her age she could fall in love again.<br> With who?<br> Us.<br> By the way...What did you do with all my money?<br> I put it in my bank.<br> Well, in the morning I'll go down with you and pick it up.<br> - What for?<br> I need it.<br> - Why?<br> To bet on the fight.<br> Charlie, if you lose the fight and the money, then you'll want to fight again...<br> No, no, I'm not going to give you the money to bet. We're rich enough.<br> Charlie!...Charlie, you're a sight for sore eyes.<br> Hello, Shimen!<br> Good to see you! You look wonderful...He looks fine.<br> You know Miss Born, Charlie's fiance?<br> This I suspected. Here you are, Mrs. Davis...<br> Charlie, something special for you.<br> Straight from the Garden of Eden.<br> - Thanks!<br> Have some wine, Shimen.<br> - What's the occasion?<br> Charlie's last fight.<br> - You don't say.<br> Don't spread it around, Shimen!<br> I'm like a grave.<br> Does that mean you won't fight anymore?<br> - That's right.<br> So you'll retire champion...That's bad?<br> It's good!<br> To the future retired champion of the world...good luck!<br> And to my five dollars that I bet on the fight, good luck too.<br> Excuse me...Charlie, everybody is betting on you. The whole neighborhood, like you was the Irish Sweepstakes!<br> People shouldn't bet.<br> - No, no, Mrs. Davis...<br> It isn't the money. It's a way of showing.<br> Over in Europe, the Nazis are killing people like us, just because of their religion.<br> But here, Charlie Davis is champion.<br> So you'll win and you'll retire champion.<br> And we are proud, period.<br> And Charlie, when you leave, stop in and say toodle-doo.<br> What's the matter with people, anyway?<br> Why do they have to bet?<br> It's a racket, don't they know? They know it's a racket.<br> People gamble.<br> Well, they're suckers! Tell them not to bet on me.<br> I'm too old to walk up and down New York telling people not to bet. Especially when they win.<br> You don't win all the time, you can lose, too.<br> Suckers like Shimen shouldn't bet!<br> - Suckers like Shimen?<br> You didn't hear what he said, Charlie...It isn't the five dollars that's important...<br> I heard, I heard...I can still lose!<br> That's right, Charlie! So why bet, why take a chance?<br> Well you don't understand. It's a diffrent thing.<br> I don't want to quit without money. I don't want to end up broke!<br> Broke? You have $60,000, you could stop right now.<br> Stop now, are you kidding?<br> There's a million bucks riding on my back!<br> If I don't fight, I don't get a dime.<br> I'm all mobbed up, tied hand and foot, down to my last buck.<br> You think I want to end up like Ben, punchy, with a blood clot on the brain, ready to die any day...<br> Or with a bullet in my back in an alley?<br> What do you mean, bullet?<br> Don't you understand? The fight's fixed!<br> Fixed? What does it mean, fixed?<br> It...it means I'm...I'm throwing the fight.<br> - Throwing the fight?<br> It means I'm gonna lose, it's all arranged!<br> It's a racket anyway. That's why I want to bet the 60 grand.<br> You get it Peg, don't you?<br> Yeah, I get it.<br> It's an investment, a sure thing...<br> Well what do you want? What are you looking at?<br> Then you didn't understand what Shimen said.<br> It's none of my business what they think or what they do! Nobody looks out for me!<br> Poor Charlie, nobody's looking out for you.<br> You're all so high and mighty!<br> You wouldn't even have that dirty candy store if it wasn't for me! You wouldn't have a dime, the clothes on your back!<br> It's my money, isn't it? You were in such a hurry to take it and slap it in the bank.<br> Sure, you said "We're rich enough", like the rest of them.<br> But it comes out of my hide!<br> I take the beatings and you take the dough, like all the rest of them!<br> Well, this time I'm taking care of the dough.<br> Give me back that 60 grand!<br> Yeah, that's right.<br> I'm like the rest of them.<br> So you want your money back?<br> Well take it back! And everything else you've given me.<br> Here! What everybody gives you!<br> The long years of happiness, the promises broken,<br> the lonely nights!<br> That's enough, Charlie.<br> Take it easy for the rest of the day, Charlie.<br> Been that way for two months, boys, there's no stopping him.<br> It's gonna be a Marlowe massacre!<br> You're looking great, champ!<br> Thanks, Pete. I feel fine. I can even name the round.<br> - Good.<br> The last night, eh, Charlie?<br> - Yeah...<br> I always get a sort of sad feeling when I see them breaking camp.<br> Tearing down the ring, collecting the gear...<br> It always felt so good after a win.<br> Walk down Lennox Avenue,<br> the kids all crazy for you, and proud...<br> Champion of the world, for the whole world to know.<br> You fixed the fight, didn't you?<br> I been worried about you, Ben.<br> The three or four times in the last month you fainted.<br> But I got it all arranged.<br> It's not like a hospital. They've got doctors...<br> They give you tests, it's kind of like a check-up.<br> You know your head's been getting worse.<br> A fella's got to take care of himself.<br> Yeah...it's been pretty bad lately.<br> That's why I shouldn't have fought you.<br> But look Charlie, you can lick Marlowe.<br> He's fast, but he ain't got what it takes.<br> If you keep on top of him, he'll go down, I know!<br> I got you covered, Ben.<br> You haven't got a thing to worry about.<br> The bet's in there for you too.<br> That's what I figured!<br> I knew that day at the gymnasium.<br> All this monkey business with the training to run the odds up against Marlowe,<br> and you're not really training at all.<br> What are you ducking out on, Charlie?<br> You can be on top for years yet.<br> That's the way things are, Ben. That's the way they are.<br> There'll be a big chunk of dough, and I'm through. It's enough.<br> Why?<br> There's nobody in your class.<br> Look, I've watched this Marlowe...studied him.<br> He backs away and shoots a left and backs away.<br> You keep on top of him and he'll go down, I know he'll go down!<br> Look...I'll show you.<br> Look Charlie...keep on top of him like this, see? And then one good punch!<br> I know...I know.<br> Maybe it's Roberts talked to you a little too fast.<br> I'd like a word with you, Ben.<br> - Say, Mr. Roberts...<br> - When are you leaving?<br> Tomorrow, when Charlie leaves.<br> I think you'd better go tonight.<br> Where to, Mr. Roberts?<br> - Where we don't have to see you.<br> - Now take it easy.<br> I'm taking it easy. We'll get somebody else for your corner, Charlie.<br> Let Charlie take care of that!<br> It's taken care of. Get out tonight.<br> And keep your mouth shut.<br> Now wait a minute, Roberts, maybe Ben is right.<br> What's our hurry? Maybe we figured this Marlowe wrong. Maybe we can cover!<br> Don't second-guess me, Charlie. It's all set.<br> You bet your pile on yourself to lose. So what are we talking about?<br> I told Quinn to dump you months ago. He said Charlie wanted you.<br> Well, Charlie doesn't want you anymore.<br> Let Charlie tell me!<br> I'm telling you. Start running!<br> You double-crossed me before.<br> I'm through, done washed up! I don't scare easy anymore!<br> - Take it easy.<br> You're punchy, Ben, your head's soft!<br> Leave him alone, he's sick!<br> I let you stay on Charlie's pension list...<br> - You don't tell me how to live!<br> - No, but I'll tell you how to die...<br> - Take it easy, Ben...<br> - Get this crazy punch-drunk wreck out of here!<br> Come on, I don't scare anymore! I don't scare anymore!<br> Ben...Ben!<br> Ben, get up, will you?...Come on, Ben...Ben!<br> Ben, come on, get up...Ben!<br> - Ben, you'll be all right...come on, get up.<br> - Oh, Charlie...sIt's the same room...Just like I told you...<br> Get a doctor, will you?<br> - No! No!<br> I don't want no doctor! I don't want anything! I can take him!<br> Let him wear himself out.<br> I can take him! I can take him!<br> I can take it! I've gotta take it! I'm the champ!<br> I think he's dead.<br> Ben...<br> Ben!<br> Hello, champ!<br> Better get ready. You only got a few minutes.<br> Did you have a good sleep?<br> - Yeah.<br> I hear Marlowe was so nervous he could barely sit still.<br> He ain't taking it easy...lying back so relaxed.<br> He's got plenty to be nervous about, too.<br> Because they're certainly going to carry him<br> out of that ring.<br> Makes you feel kinda funny, not having Ben with you.<br> He was a great champ.<br> Laying the bet, get ready!<br> I was talking to a few of the reporters, out in the hall...They asked me how you felt.<br> I says, "How do you think a champ feels?<br> "He's sleeping inside."<br> Yeah...dreaming.<br> Introducing the worthy contender...<br> that fast and rugged boy from the Lone Star State...<br> Jackie Marlowe!<br> And now, introducing a great champion<br> who has met and defeated<br> all the leading contenders,<br> the champion of the world,<br> Charlie Davis!<br> Come on, boys...Break this and fight!<br> Boo...Boo!<br> Come on...Make a surprise...make a surprise!<br> Boo!<br> There's still no action in this fight, ladies and gentlemen.<br> The champion looks badly out of condition.<br> Okay, boys...I warned you for the last time...Fight!<br> - What round is it?<br> - It's the end of the 12th.<br> I'll fall down before the 15th.<br> Hit!<br> Three...four...five...<br> One...two...three...four...five...<br> You sold me out, you rat!<br> Take a dive and finish it.<br> Sold out like Ben.<br> It looks like we have a new champion!<br> All right, buddy...He just lost his head, is all.<br> When the bell rings, get in there and finish him, son!<br> I'll kill him! I'll kill him!<br> Down, Charlie!...Stay down!<br> Get him, Charlie...Get him!<br> Charlie!<br> The guy's crazy! He's crazy!<br> I'm gonna kill him.<br> Take a dive and finish it!<br> - I'm gonna kill him!...I'm gonna kill him.<br> Keep running and you'll be champ!<br> You're behind in points, anyway.<br> You've gotta knock him out to win.<br> You know what you're doing, Charlie?<br> Last round coming up. Stay away from him.<br> I've never seen anything like it before in my life.<br> A great silence has descended over this crowd.<br> They seem to sense the kill.<br> There's fear in Marlowe's eyes, as Davis looks for an opening.<br> Davis is following Marlowe around the ring now like a tiger stalking its prey.<br> By a knockout, the winner...<br> still champion of the world...<br> Charlie!<br> Back in my league now, aren't you baby?<br> Congratulations, champ.<br> Get yourself a new boy.<br> I retire.<br> What makes you think you can get away with this?<br> What are you going to do?<br> Kill me?<br> Everybody dies!<br> - Charlie! Charlie! Charlie?<br> - Hey, let her through!<br> Are you all right Charlie? Are you all right?<br> I never felt better in my life!<br>
