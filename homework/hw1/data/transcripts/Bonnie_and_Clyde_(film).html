                        Hey, boy!<br> What are you doing with my mama's car?<br> Wait there!<br> Ain't you ashamed?<br> Trying to steal an old lady's automobile?<br> What are you talking about?<br> I've been thinking about buying me one.<br> Bull!<br> You ain't got money for dinner,<br> let alone buying a car.<br> Well, ma'am, I'll tell you something.<br> I've got enough money for a Coca-Cola...<br> ...and since it don't look like<br> you're going to invite me inside...<br> You'd steal the dining room table if I did.<br> You want to go into town with me?<br> How would that be?<br> I'm going to work, anyway.<br> You're going to work, huh?<br> What kind of work do you do?<br> None of your business.<br> I'll bet you're a movie star.<br> Huh? A Iady mechanic?<br> A maid?<br> What do you think I am?<br> A waitress.<br> What line of work are you in...<br> when you're not stealing cars?<br> Well, I'm looking for suitable<br> employment right at the moment.<br> Oh, yeah, but what did you do before?<br> I was in State Prison.<br> State Prison?<br> Well, I guess some little old lady<br> wasn't so nice.<br> It was armed robbery.<br> The things that turn up<br> in the street these days.<br> Hey, what do you all do for a good time<br> around here? Listen to the grass grow?<br> I guess you had a Iot more fun<br> up at State Prison.<br> - I'll tell you. See my right foot?<br> - Yeah?<br> I chopped two toes off that foot<br> with an axe.<br> What! Why?<br> - To get off of work detaiI. Want to see it?<br> - No!<br> I surely don't intend to stand<br> here in the middle of Main Street...<br> ...and Iook at your dirty feet!<br> Boy, did you really do that?<br> What's it like?<br> What do you mean, prison?<br> Armed robbery.<br> It ain't like anything.<br> Shoot. I knew you never robbed any pIace,<br> you faker.<br> Bet you wouldn't have<br> the gumption to use it.<br> You just wait right here and<br> you keep your eyes open.<br> Hey, what's your name?<br> Clyde Barrow.<br> Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.<br> Uh, pleased to meet you.<br> Hey, hey, hey, slow down,<br> slow down, slow down.<br> Take it easy, you've got my hand trapped.<br> Cut it out! Cut it out!<br> AII right, now.<br> I might as well tell you right off.<br> I ain't much of a lover boy.<br> That don't mean nothing<br> personal about you.<br> I never saw no percentage in it.<br> Ain't nothing wrong with me.<br> I don't like boys.<br> Boy! Boy! Boy!<br> "Boy," what?<br> Your advertising is just dandy.<br> Folks would never guess<br> you don't have a thing to sell.<br> You'd better take me home now.<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> - Now don't you touch me.<br> AII right, aII right...<br> ...if all you want is a stud service,<br> you get on back to West Dallas,<br> ...and you stay there, the rest of your Iife.<br> You're worth a lot more...<br> ...and you know it, and that's why<br> you're comin' along with me.<br> You could find a lover boy on<br> every damn corner in town.<br> Don't matter to them<br> if you're waiting tables or picking cotton...<br> ...but it does make a damn to me!<br> Why?<br> "Why?" What do you mean, "why?"<br> Because you're different, that's why.<br> You know, you're like me.<br> You want different things.<br> You've got something<br> better than being a waitress.<br> You and me traveling together, we could<br> cut a path clean across this state...<br> ...and Kansas and Missouri and Oklahoma,<br> and everybody would know about it.<br> You Iisten to me, Miss Bonnie Parker.<br> You Iisten to me.<br> How'd you like to go<br> walking into the dining room...<br> ...of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas...<br> ...wearing a nice silk dress and<br> have everybody waiting on you?<br> Would you like that?<br> That seem like a lot to ask?<br> That ain't enough for you.<br> You've got a right to that.<br> When did you figure all that up?<br> The minute I saw you.<br> Why?<br> Because you may be the<br> best damn girI in Texas.<br> You were born somewhere<br> around east Texas, right?<br> Come from a big old family.<br> You went to school,<br> but you didn't take to it much...<br> ...because you were a Iot<br> smarter than everybody eIse...<br> ...so you just up and quit one day.<br> Now, when you were 16...1 7,<br> there was a guy who worked in a...<br> Cement plant.<br> Right. And you Iiked him...<br> ...because he thought you were<br> just as nice as you could be.<br> You almost married that guy, but then you<br> thought no, you didn't think you would.<br> So then you got your job in a cafe.<br> And now you wake up every morning<br> and you hate it.<br> You just hate it. You get on down there<br> and you put on your white uniform...<br> It's pink.<br> Those truck drivers come there<br> to eat your greasy burgers and...<br> ...they kid you and you kid them back<br> but they're stupid and dumb boys...<br> ...with their big old tattoos,<br> and you don't like it.<br> They ask you for dates and sometimes<br> you go, but you mostly don't because...<br> ...all they're trying to do is get in your<br> pants, whether you want them to or not.<br> So you go on home and you<br> sit in your room and...<br> ...you think: "Now when, and how...<br> "...am I ever going to get away from this?"<br> And now you know.<br> Change that. I don't like it.<br> You're a knock-out!<br> - Hey, that ain't ours.<br> - Sure it is.<br> No, but we came in this one.<br> That don't mean we have to go home in it.<br> Where have you been keeping yourself?<br> I sIept out by the car.<br> These accommodations ain't<br> particularly deluxe.<br> If they're after us, I want the first shot.<br> Now, you come on out here.<br> We got some work to do.<br> You're good!<br> I ain't good. I'm the best.<br> And modest.<br> Now see that?<br> Set her spinning.<br> It's all right, all right.<br> Come on, try it again.<br> Try it again, now this time<br> come down slow, slow.<br> Now, how about that?<br> Now, ain't you something? I tell you.<br> I'm going to get you a Smith & Wesson.<br> Go in your hand easier.<br> - I want you to try something now.<br> - Hey, you!<br> No, sir! No, sir!<br> Y'all go right ahead.<br> It used to be my place.<br> But it's not anymore.<br> Bank took it.<br> Yes, sir, they moved us off.<br> Now it belongs to them.<br> Why, that's a pitiful shame.<br> You're damn right, ma'am.<br> Me and him put in the years here.<br> Y'all go right ahead.<br> We just came by for a last look.<br> Y'all mind?<br> Hey, Davis! Come on over here!<br> That's right.<br> Go on.<br> Much obliged.<br> My name is Otis Harris. This is Davis.<br> We worked this place.<br> How're you?<br> This here's Miss Bonnie Parker.<br> - Glad to meet you.<br> - I'm Clyde Barrow.<br> We rob banks.<br> Look, I don't want you<br> to worry about nothing.<br> This is going to be<br> the easiest thing in the world.<br> Your mama could take this bank.<br> You just be ready if I need you.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> This is a stick-up! Just take it easy<br> and nothing's going to happen to you.<br> Give me the money.<br> What money, mister?<br> There ain't no money here.<br> What are you talking about?<br> This here's a bank, ain't it?<br> Well, it was a bank,<br> but we failed three weeks ago.<br> AII right, now, you get on out here.<br> You get on out there and tell my girl.<br> Come on, come on,<br> you tell her what you told me.<br> We've got $1 .98, and you're laughing!<br> Let's see now.<br> A loaf of bread, a dozen eggs...<br> ...quart of milk, four fried pies.<br> Come on now, you sure<br> you ain't got no peach pies?<br> Get the hell out of here!<br> Go ahead! Go ahead!<br> He tried to kill me. Why'd he try<br> to kill me. I didn't want to hurt him.<br> Try to get something to eat...<br> ...and some son of a bitch<br> comes up on you with a meat- cleaver.<br> I ain't against him.<br> Now, you just tell me<br> what was wrong with that, boy.<br> Dirt.<br> Dirt?<br> Dirt in the fueI Iine. Just bIowed it away.<br> Excuse me, ma'am,<br> is there anything else I could do for you?<br> Well, you're a smart feller.<br> You sure do know a lot about automobiles,<br> don't you?<br> Yes.
