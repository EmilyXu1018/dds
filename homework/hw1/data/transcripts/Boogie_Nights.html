I don't really<br> know if I need all that bass.<br> Oh, I think you need all that bass.<br> Heh, I mean, if you want a system<br> to handle what you want...<br> ...yeah, you need the bass.<br> See, this... This is hi-fi, okay?<br> High fidelity. Know what that means?<br> That means<br> this is the highest quality fidelity.<br> Hi-fi. Those are two very important things<br> to have in a stereo system.<br> - It's the price. For the 420...<br> - I have this very unit in my home.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> Of course, I got it modified<br> with the TK-421...<br> ...which, uh, kicks it up another...<br> ...I don't know, maybe three or four, um,<br> quads per channel, you know.<br> But that's really... That's technical talk.<br> That doesn't really concern you.<br> Still a little uncertain, aren't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know what you need?<br> You need a test drive.<br> That's what you need.<br> You need a test drive.<br> It's one thing to hear it from Buck's mouth,<br> it's another to hear it from the TK-421.<br> So let me just pop in this 8-track...<br> ...and you just give a listen,<br> tell me what you think, okay?<br> Whoo. Huh?<br> You hear that? You hear the bass? Right?<br> You hear it? It kicks.<br> It turns. It curls up your belly.<br> Makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right?<br> Heh, you got that?<br> Now, see, if you get this system as is...<br> ...it's not gonna sound like this<br> without the TK-421 modification...<br> ...and we do that in the store right here,<br> very small price.<br> Go on and move with it if you need to.<br> It helps me.<br> Thank you for your time.<br> Oh, okay. Well, hey. So long, partner.<br> - What the fuck was that?<br> - What?<br> - Have I told you?<br> - Have...

Fucking me?<br> Making love to me?<br> Everyone has one thing, you think?<br> I mean, everyone's given<br> one special thing, right?<br> That's right.<br> Everyone's blessed<br> with one special thing.<br> Hey.<br> I want you to know I plan on being a star.<br> A big, bright shining star.<br> That's what I want.<br> That's what I'm gonna get.<br> I know.<br> I gotta go.<br> You're lucky.<br> Hi.<br> - Eddie.<br> - Hi.<br> - Want a ride?<br> - Jack?<br> - Yeah. Want a ride?<br> - Hi. Uh, well, I'm going really far.<br> Do you remember me<br> from a couple hours ago?<br> Yeah, I remember.<br> Come with us, sweetie.<br> Okay.<br> This is a really cool car, Jack.<br> So, what I'm trying to tell you, Eddie...<br> ...is that it takes a lot<br> of the good, old American green stuff...<br> ...to make one of these things,<br> you know what I mean?<br> I mean, you know, you've got your camera,<br> you've got your film...<br> ...you got your lights, you got your sound,<br> you got your lab costs...<br> ...you got your developing, you got<br> your synching, you got your editing.<br> Before you turn around, you've spent<br> maybe 20-, 25-, $30,000 on a movie.<br> - Wow, that's a lot of money.<br> - You bet your ass it is.<br> But if you make a good one...<br> ...there's practically no end<br> to how much money you can make.<br> - Have you seen Jack's house?<br> - No.<br> - He will.<br> - He'll see it.<br> You got maybe 15, 20 guys<br> standing around...<br> ...just making sure<br> that your lighting is right.<br> But you can work out in the morning,<br> you can work out at noon...<br> ...you can work out at night.<br> It doesn't matter<br> if you don't have those juices flowing...<br> ...down there in the Mr. Torpedo area,<br> in the fun zone...<br> ...but you gotta get the people<br> in the theater.<br> You know, you need the big dicks,<br> the big tits.<br> Uh-oh. Here we go.<br> How do you keep them in the theater<br> after they've come?<br> With beauty...<br> ...and with acting.<br> Now, I understand you've gotta<br> get them in the theater, you know?<br> You gotta keep the seats full.<br> But I don't wanna make a film<br> where they show up, they sit down...<br> ...they jack off, and they get up<br> and they get out before the story ends.<br> It is my dream, it is my goal,<br> it is my idea to make a film...<br> ...that the story just sucks them in...<br> ...and when they spurt out that joy juice,<br> they just gotta sit in it.<br> They can't move<br> until they find out how the story ends.<br> You know, aah,<br> I wanna make a film like that.<br> And I understand,<br> you know, they have to make films...<br> I've made them myself,<br> you know, that are a few laughs...<br> ...everybody fucks their brains out,<br> and that's fine.<br> But it's my dream to make a film...<br> ...that is true...<br> ...and right and dramatic.<br> You sure you don't want a Fresca?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You're out of limes, Jack.<br> Well, check in the kitchen, darling.<br> I'm going to bed.<br> Good night, Jackie.<br> Don't stay up too late.<br> Good night, beauty.<br> - Good night, Eddie.<br> - Good night.<br> Glad you came by.<br> - You're great.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> She's the best.<br> She's a wonderful mother, you know?<br> She's a mother<br> to all those who need love.<br> - She's really nice.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking,<br> I wanna be in business with you, Eddie.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah. What do you think?<br> I'd love it.<br> What do you think of Rollergirl?<br> - She's great.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Would you like to do it?<br> - Have sex?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Oh, yeah. I mean, I'd love to.<br> - She's really foxy.<br> - Oh, you bet your ass she is.<br> You're officially out of limes, Jack.<br> Well, I'll pick up some for you<br> tomorrow or something.<br> Come here, darling.<br> I want you to go over there<br> and sit on the couch with Eddie.<br> Here we go. Are we gonna fuck?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Ha, ha. Wait a minute.<br> - Are you ready?<br> - Yeah.

Yeah, that's one thing.<br> But soon that goes, I die,<br> then what do I have? I got nothing.<br> Mm-hm.<br> You know, I want something<br> I can send home, you know?<br> Something I can send to my brothers<br> and say, "Look at me.<br> Look at me and all the beautiful women<br> I've been with."<br> So what? You want me to talk to Jack?<br> Yeah.

Yeah, listen.<br> I'm sorry, there's no Maggie here.<br> Okay. No, no. It's not a problem.<br> Okay. Ciao.<br> - Who was that?<br> - Oh, some kid looking for his mom.<br> - What the fuck are you doing?<br> - What's it look like they're doing?<br> That's my wife.<br> Shut up, Bill.

Anyway, listen.<br> - Yeah.<br> - For the shoot, I wanna talk about the look.<br> - See about getting this new zoom lens.<br> - Right.<br> I was wondering if we'd be able<br> to look into getting more lights.<br> Jack wants a minimal thing.<br> Yeah, well, very often minimal means<br> a lot more photographically, I think...<br> - Well, I think than most people understand.<br> - I understand.<br> No, I know you understand.<br> I'm talking about some other people.<br> I think what Jack is talking about<br> is minimal.<br> Not really natural, but minimal.<br> - Okay, fine. Uh, I was just saying...<br> - I understand.<br> Yeah, because I'm trying<br> to give each picture its own look.<br> - Can we talk about this later?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> You gotta go somewhere, or...?<br> Yeah. No. I mean, unh...<br> I was hoping for the shoot tomorrow...<br> ...we could send Rocky down<br> and he could pick it up.<br> - Kurt.<br> - No, hey. Got you.<br> You gotta go somewhere,<br> so, hey, what the fuck?<br> It's only the photography of the film<br> we're talking about.<br> - Are you giving me shit, Kurt?<br> - No. Hey, no way, Little Bill.<br> My fucking wife has an ass in her cock<br> in the driveway, Kurt.<br> All right? I'm sorry if my thoughts<br> are not on the photography...<br> - ...of the film we're shooting tomorrow.<br> - Okay. No big deal. Sorry.<br> - All right?<br> - Gotcha.<br> All right, where is it?<br> I think she's sick.<br> - Oh, what the fuck is this?<br> - I didn't do anything. I... I didn't...<br> - Is she breathing?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I think maybe she did too much coke.<br> - Do you think so, doctor?<br> - This girl's definitely OD'd.<br> - Oh, fuck me. Okay.<br> I want you to handle this for me, Johnny.<br> - You listening?<br> - Yeah.<br> Get her in the car, drive her to Saint Joe's.<br> Drop her off in the front. I don't want any...<br> - Got you.<br> - Make sure no one sees the limo.<br> - Got it.<br> - What the fuck is this?<br> This is twice in two days<br> that a chick has OD'd on me.<br> You think maybe you ought to<br> think about getting some new shit?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Ah.<br> - Oh, shit.

It's not right. It's not cool.<br> It's just not sexy. I mean,<br> it's not sexy like it should be, Jack.<br> This guy's more of like<br> a James Bond-type character.<br> You know, he's classy.<br> He's a world-traveled guy.<br> - I like that.<br> - Reed could play my partner.<br> - I like that a lot.<br> - We could make it really good, Jack.<br> Honestly, if you direct it,<br> we make a whole series with a whole story.<br> I mean, it's exactly<br> what we've always talked about.<br> Please?<br> When we get back, set up the typewriter.<br> We'll see what comes out of it.<br> But I have to talk to the Colonel<br> when we get to Vegas.<br> And, Dirk, you gotta<br> work on the Colonel too, Dirk.<br> I mean, you gotta be committed.<br> Right, right.

Did you get off work, man?<br> - I don't dance Sunday nights.<br> - Right.<br> - Whose Vette is that out in the driveway?<br> - Dirk.<br> - I'm so jealous of him.<br> - That shit's jamming.<br> It's dropped down low with a 350 cube,<br> ...4-speed, 4.10 gears,<br> ...hand-rubbed lacquer<br> with a dual-plane manifold.<br> Tsk, full fucking race cams. Whoa.<br> Yep.<br> I'm pretty happy with it, you know.<br> It's a great look for you, I think.<br> It's pretty original, you know, I think.<br> Right.<br> Heh. I'm gonna take this off.<br> - Ha, ha.<br> - Yeah.<br> What were we talking about before?<br> - Um, oil painting?<br> - No.<br> - No... Yes. I mean, um, but I was saying...<br> - Oh, oh, oh. Sunsets.<br> Right, yeah.<br> I was saying that I love sunsets.<br> - But sunrises are better. Heh.<br> - Exactly. Ha, ha.<br> I thought I was the only one<br> who felt that way.<br> - No, I feel that way.<br> - Really?<br> Yes, really. Hey, have you ever heard<br> my stereo system?<br> - No.<br> - I'm gonna open my own business.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes. Yes. It's my dream.<br> Okay, it's hi-fi stereo equipment<br> at discount prices.<br> Yeah. It's called<br> Buck's Super Stereo World.<br> - That is a fucking great idea. Heh.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know, in the 80s,<br> that's when it's gonna happen for real.<br> - Really?<br> - Yes, really. The 1980s.<br> Wow.<br> I wanted you to give me a minute<br> so I could tell you how much I love you.<br> I mean, it's gonna be a new year and<br> we're gonna start things and do things...<br> ...and I just wanted you to know<br> how much I care about you.<br> I really care about you, honey.<br> - You're my little baby.<br> - Thank you, Amber.<br> You're the best thing that's happened to me<br> since my son went off, and I just...<br> I love you, honey.<br> I love you too.<br> Fucking 1980, you know?<br> - Can you believe it?<br> - I can't.<br> I mean, it's like, the next thing you know<br> it's gonna be, like, 1990 and 2000.<br> - I mean, can you imagine?<br> - Hmm.<br> Goodbye, 1979. Hello, 1980.<br> Okay.<br> Make sure you snort it back real quick<br> and hard.<br> - Huh?<br> - Like this.<br> Okay.<br> - Ugh, it burns.<br> - It's good though, right?<br> - It's going in my throat.<br> - Hmm.<br> That's the drip. The drip's the best part.<br> - It tastes like aspirin.<br> - Here. Do one more in the other nostril.<br> - I need a drink of water, I think.<br> - Mm-mm.<br> One more, and then a drink of water.<br> Do you think I look cool when I do it?<br> So let's talk about the future.<br> Let's talk about what video means<br> to this industry.<br> And let's talk about how all of us...<br> Not one of us.<br> How all of us are gonna profit.<br> I've been doing theater in San Francisco<br> and San Diego...<br> ...about as long as<br> you've been doing stag and hard-core.<br> We're all familiar with your biography,<br> Floyd.<br> No one is doubting your credentials<br> or your history.<br> Then why the resistance?<br> I mean, this industry is gonna<br> be turned upside down soon enough.<br> - Why help it?<br> - Why not be prepared?<br> Colonel's got the money.<br> You got the talent, Jack.<br> I got the connection to the equipment<br> and the mail-order distribution.<br> Not to mention those kids out there<br> who are hot fuck action to the max, Jack.<br> This is the future.<br> Videotape tells the truth.<br> Wait a minute. You come into my house,<br> my party, to tell me about the future?<br> That the future is tape, videotape,<br> and not film?<br> That it's amateurs and not professionals?<br> I'm a filmmaker.<br> That's why I will never make a movie<br> on videotape.<br> And I'll tell you something else.<br> I will never, ever loan out<br> any of the actors...<br> - ...that I have under contract to you.<br> - Wait, wait, wait, Jack.<br> I'm not a complicated man. I like cinema.<br> In particular,<br> I like to see people fucking on film.<br> I don't wanna win an Oscar,<br> and I don't wanna reinvent the wheel.<br> I like simple pleasures like butter<br> in my ass, lollipops in my mouth.<br> That's just me.<br> That's just something that I enjoy.<br> Call me crazy, call me a pervert...<br> ...but there's one little thing<br> that I wanna do in this life...<br> ...and that is I wanna make<br> a dollar and a cent in this business.<br> Ahh, Jack, I'm not trying to hurt you.<br> I'm trying to help you<br> stay one step ahead of the game.<br> We're going in circles now.<br> We're in familiar territory.<br> The territory we're in is the future.<br> Not to mention the cost.<br> You know, if it looks like shit<br> and it sounds like shit...<br> ...then it must be shit.<br> You're holding on too tight, Jack.<br> It doesn't have to look good.<br> Film is just too damn expensive.<br> And the theaters are already converting<br> to video projectors.<br> I haven't heard that.<br> Well, it's true.<br> Well...<br> Ten minutes before the new year.<br> I'd like to spend it with my friends.<br> We will or will not continue<br> this conversation.<br> - Hey, Dirk. Ha, ha.<br> - Hey, Scotty. What's up?<br> - Fucking New Year's, right?<br> - 1980.<br> - Oh, man, right. Did you see my new car?<br> - You got a new car?<br> - Yeah. Wanna see?<br> - Yeah.<br> All right, cool. It's out front.<br> Come on. It's out front.<br> Dirk. I want you to meet my friend Todd.<br> Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.<br> - What's up? How are you?<br> - We finally meet.<br> - Yeah.<br> - No.<br> I was telling you about him before.<br> You remember. Todd Parker.<br> - He works at Party Boys Strip Club.<br> - Oh, cool. You're a dancer.<br> - Yeah, I got some moves.<br> - Dirk? Uh...<br> I'm sorry. You coming?<br> Or you wanna talk to these guys...?<br> Yeah, Scotty. I'll be around in a bit.<br> We can talk then?<br> - Okay.<br> - See you later, Reed.<br> - See you.<br> - All right.<br> Uh, when you get by, uh, the lights,<br> close your eyes.<br> - Okay?<br> - All right.<br> - All right, just follow my voice. All right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Here, here, here.<br> - Here, here, here.<br> - Where?<br> Keep coming. All right, open them.<br> This is it. Ha-ha-ha.<br> - It's cool.<br> - Yeah. You wanna get inside?<br> - When did you get this?<br> - Uh, yesterday.<br> Actually, I had it painted yesterday<br> so the paint might still be kind of sticky.<br> - This is great, man. Really great.<br> - You wanna go for a ride?<br> Wait, wait, wait. Fuck.<br> Hell, how much time is left?<br> - I'm sorry, Dirk.<br> - What the hell is the matter with you?<br> - Why did you do that, Scotty?<br> - Uh, you look at me sometimes.<br> - What?<br> - I wanted to know if you like me.<br> Well, of cour... Uh.<br> Yeah, I like you, Scotty.<br> - Can I kiss you? Please?<br> - Scotty, I don't...<br> - Can I kiss you on the mouth?<br> - No.<br> - Please let me.<br> - Scotty.<br> I'm really sorry. I didn't mean<br> to grab you like that or scare you.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Do you wanna kiss me?<br> - Scotty, wha...?<br> - No?<br> - What is the matter with you?<br> - Uh, forget it.<br> I'm really drunk. Really, I am. I'm just...<br> I'm out of my head.<br> I'm so wa... I'm really wasted.<br> Really, Dirk.<br> - I'm really wasted. I'm crazy right now.<br> - I understand, man.<br> - I'm really crazy, you know?<br> - Do you wanna go back inside?<br> Uh...<br> - Do you like my car, Dirk?<br> - What?<br> - I mean...<br> - Yeah. Yeah.<br> Because I wanted to, you know...<br> I wanted to make sure<br> you thought it was cool...<br> ...or else I was gonna take it back.<br> Oh.<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's great, Scotty.<br> Happy New Year.<br> - Happy New Year, Scotty.<br> - I love you. I really love you.<br> - I love you too, Scotty.<br> - Okay.<br> - All right, let's go back inside, okay?<br> - All right. All right.<br> Fucking idiot.<br> I'm a fucking idiot.<br> I'm a fucking idiot.<br> Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.<br> Fucking idiot.<br> Jackie. Jackie.<br> Two minutes, pops. Let's go, let's go.<br> Whoo!<br> Two. Two minutes. Two minutes.<br> Come on, Little Bill.<br> Okay. Becky, I'm...<br> Little Bill. Smile, man. Come here.<br> Right, ha, ha.<br> I'm so excited.<br> Little Bill, champagne?<br> - Aw, thanks. That's really nice of you.<br> - Happy New Year.<br> - To you too.<br> - Okay, man.<br> Get some champagne, dude.<br> No, I'm sorry, I don't have any matches.<br> - I got it here, hold on.<br> - Happy New Year.<br> Hey, Kurt, have you seen my wife?<br> No, no. Hey, they're doing<br> that countdown thing.<br> - Come on in, man.<br> - Okay.<br> Come on, say something. Make a toast.<br> Hey, Little Bill, look at me.<br> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...<br> ...four, three, two...<br> - What the fuck was that?<br> - Where's Jack?<br> Where's Jack?<br> What about your character Brock Landers...<br> ...and what some people might consider<br> violent attitudes towards women?<br> Violence? No. What...?<br> I mean, if there's a certain amount<br> of, you know, violence or action...<br> ...in this series of films,<br> you know, that's the movie.<br> If Brock Landers is slick with a gun...<br> ...he does so<br> only in the vein of good and right.<br> Brock protects the values<br> of the American ideal...<br> ...and fights for causes that instill pride in<br> a society where morals are hard to come by.<br> - Who sent you? Who sent you?<br> - Get the fuck off me, asshole.<br> Lie still! Lie still<br> or I'll punch you in the goddamn face!<br> Fuck off.<br> I'll find out who sent you.<br> Amber, I live in this world.<br> I don't like violence any more than you do.<br> Violence is a bad thing.<br> But when you see violence in films, it's...<br> You know...<br> if movies, films, caused violence...<br> ...we'd be able<br> to wipe out violence tomorrow.<br> Boom, no more films.<br> That's fine with me.<br> I'll find something else to do.<br> I'll fuck on my own time.<br> You know, I got other interests.<br> I'm a magician.<br> Um, and, you know, hopefully, that'll be<br> something that I focus on in the future.<br> Because you can't fuck forever.<br> I realize that. Anyway, violence...<br> ...is something that plagues us<br> as a society.<br> Well, the fine line is<br> I'm playing a character.<br> You know, I mean, I'm Dirk Diggler.<br> Brock Landers<br> is a character that I'm playing.<br> I'm gonna ask you once more,<br> and I'm gonna ask you nice.<br> Where the fuck is Ringo, you bitch?<br> Fuck you.<br> Oh!<br> - Uh, why do I love him?<br> - Yeah.<br> He's, uh... He's very special.<br> And, um, he can fuck hard<br> or he can fuck, like, really gently.<br> He's the best.<br> Uh, I think that's part of my reason<br> for doing this, you know?<br> I've gotten thousands<br> upon thousands of letters...<br> ...you know, from people telling me:<br> "God, you've taught me this and<br> you've made our love life so much better."<br> And this isn't "Go out and have sex<br> with 10 million people."<br> And, you know, "How to get a girl off."<br> It's about how to get your wife off.<br> If only people<br> could have been doing this before...<br> ...we could have saved<br> a million relationships.<br> You know, I've saved thousands.<br> Blocking, an idea or a movement.<br> Jack will put the final touches together<br> for what the camera needs for editing...<br> ...but, you know, he allows me<br> to block my own sex scenes...<br> ...and, you know, gives me the freedom to<br> develop the character and stuff like that.<br> God, ha, ha, I don't know any other,<br> you know, director...<br> ...who would let an actor,<br> you know, do that, heh. You know?<br> Ha-ha-ha. I don't allow him<br> to block his own sex scenes.<br> It is. It's jealousy.<br> It's deceitfulness. It's vindictiveness.<br> It's all of that stuff, you know?<br> But, I mean, God, what can you expect<br> when you're on top, you know?<br> It's like Napoleon.<br> When he was the king...<br> ...you know, people were constantly<br> trying to conquer him...<br> ...you know, in the Roman Empire.<br> So it's history repeating itself<br> all over again.<br> To all the critics out there,<br> I know they're gonna be reviewing this...<br> ...and I know<br> they're gonna try to knock me.<br> I just want them to know... Is it okay<br> if I say this into the camera, Amber?<br> Okay.<br> I only am who I am<br> because I was born that way.<br> I have a gift, and I am trying<br> to not be selfish about it, but to use it.<br> Okay? And if you wanna knock me for that,<br> it's your own problem, okay?<br> Jealousy will get you nowhere.<br> I'm gonna keep rocking on.<br> For Dirk Diggler...<br> ...the future is something<br> to look forward to, not to fear.<br> He is a creative man of many interests:<br> Film, poetry, karate, music, and dance.<br> He is a man of passion and mystery.<br> He is a man of lust.<br> - It's my poem to you.<br> - It's good, Amber. It's really good.<br> You're like a director now.<br> So have you shown Jack yet?<br> No, just you. I wanted you to be the first.<br> - It's really good, Amber. Congratulations.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Thanks, baby.<br> - Wow.<br> Um, the only thing I was wondering is...<br> You might think about cutting that part<br> where Jack talks...<br> - About blocking the sex?<br> - Yeah.<br> That stuff about me<br> not being a black belt is not true.<br> Yeah. I can fix that.<br> - Ace of spades.<br> - How did it turn out?<br> - Are you sure?<br> - No.<br> - Shit.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hey, how was it, man?<br> - What?<br> Really? I bet. You're so good.<br> - Look, slow... Slow down. Slow down.<br> - You'll have to show it to me.<br> Guys, guys, guys.<br> Slow down, Colonel. Say again?<br> I'll be right there.<br> So...?<br> Well, let me tell you, Jack, ha, ha.<br> I mean, I don't mean to laugh about it,<br> but she was 15 going on 150, believe me.<br> She was... You would never know it.<br> Never know.<br> I mean, I was fooled completely.<br> I mean, I've had a few of them.<br> Anyhow...<br> You do believe me, don't you, Jack?<br> Yeah, I believe you.<br> Anyway, so I take her home, Jack,<br> you know, and I got her there...<br> ...and I tell her not to do so much coke...<br> ...but she must have done 20 lines<br> of this stuff in, like, 5 minutes.<br> It's like a vacuum in her nose.<br> And there's only...<br> Just going up like crazy.<br> Anyway, she's got all this stuff going up,<br> and the next thing you know, she started...<br> Something must have broken up there,<br> blood poured all over the place.<br> All over the sheets and everything.<br> Just... pouring out.<br> - Oh, Jack. Oh, God.<br> - All right.<br> You thought she was older.<br> You... You didn't do anything.<br> She was just at the... She was at your<br> place. You didn't do anything, right?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You didn't do anything?<br> - You know me. I didn't do a thing.<br> - You didn't do anything?<br> - No, I didn't do anything.<br> - All right, nothing.<br> But they, uh...<br> They found something at the house.<br> - What?<br> - There's something that's...<br> Jack, it's my fucking weakness, Jack.<br> It's just, they're so small, and they're<br> so cute and they're so adorable.<br> - I just can't help it when they're so cute...<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> No, no, Jack.
