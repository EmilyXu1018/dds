Come on.<br> This way, Mr. Brock.<br> Sorry I missed your<br> arrival, Mr. Brock.<br> Welcome to the Washington Statler.<br> - I've been inspecting your wing...<br> - I ain't got a whole floor?<br> You've got an entire<br> wing, Mr. Brock.<br> When I say I want a whole<br> floor, I don't want one wing.<br> I don't want two wings.<br> I want the whole bird.<br> Your private elevator.<br> Private, huh? That's more like it.<br> - Hello, Mr. Brock.<br> - How are you?<br> - Mr. Brock, Mr. Devery...<br> - I thought you said this was private.<br> What are you waitin' for? Take off.<br> You'll be more than satisfied.<br> This is the public<br> corridor and elevators.<br> No need to use them,<br> but you may if...<br> The west, east and<br> south suites, all duplex.<br> - Which one's mine?<br> - The south suite.<br> Each one a completely private<br> and separate apartment.<br> This is it.<br> Sleeping quarters upstairs.<br> Terrace overlooks<br> half of Washington.<br> - I would like to point out...<br> - It's all right.<br> I would like to point out<br> that this suite is one we...<br> That this suite is usually<br> reserved for foreign diplomats.<br> Oh, I almost forgot.<br> We thought you might like this.<br> - Compliments of the management.<br> - Okay, don't bother me.<br> May I?<br> May I show you the rest<br> of the accommodations?<br> Hey, Billie!<br> What?<br> Not bad, huh?<br> - It's all right.<br> - "All right," she says.<br> - Do you know what this place costs a day?<br> - 400. You told me.<br> Mrs. Brock seems delighted<br> with the arrangements.<br> - It's not Mrs. Brock.<br> - Oh?<br> There ain't no Mrs. Brock<br> except my mother, and she's dead.<br> - I see.<br> - Now, look, don't get nosy.<br> Well, not at all.<br> - She's a fiance.<br> - Mine, in fact.<br> Eddie, take care of him.<br> Pardon me, sir.<br> - Thank you.

Welcome to our city.<br> I told you I got a couple<br> of things that can't wait.<br> - Hey, son, I got this ticket to get fixed.<br> - What's it about?<br> Some louse just as we<br> blew into town. Here.<br> - Just because I'm a lawyer does<br> not mean I own the law.<br> - What'd I do? What'd I do?<br> All right, I'll see<br> what I can manage.<br> - What did we make out?<br> - It may cost you a shade more than we estimated.<br> - How much more?<br> - It's negligible.<br> - Why more?<br> - Supply and demand, Harry.<br> Crooks are becoming<br> rare in these parts.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - Don't worry? This stuff<br> ain't deductible, you know.<br> I'm not so sure.<br> Item: One bribe, $80,000.<br> Eighty? You're very handy<br> with my dough, you know it?<br> And you're gonna be interviewed.<br> Fella's coming up here any minute.<br> Name's Paul Verrall. He's a writer.<br> Freelance snoop, political<br> stuff. Think pieces.<br> I don't wanna talk to no writers.<br> I gotta get shaved. Eddie!<br> - You better talk to this one.<br> - Why?<br> This is one of the few fellas<br> in Washington to look out for.<br> The thing to do is take him<br> in. Then he doesn't go poking.<br> What's so important?<br> What we're after here<br> is pretty important.<br> Listen, Harry, to get by in this<br> town takes power. You got some.<br> Takes money. You got plenty.<br> But above all, it takes<br> judgment and intelligence.<br> That's why you pay<br> me 100,000 a year.<br> What's all the excitement?<br> Nothing. I'm just trying to<br> make it clear where I fit in.<br> Eddie, get me a shave up here.<br> Right.<br> - Harry.<br> - What?<br> Barber shop.<br> Tell Billie to wear something<br> nice and plain for the congressman.<br> - He may bring his wife.<br> - Tell her yourself.

He knows me insides out.<br> - That's right.<br> Maybe I should be<br> interviewing Eddie.<br> That's pretty good. Maybe you got<br> something there. Sit down. Sit down.<br> Well, what's it gonna<br> be, pal, a plug or a pan?<br> - Why...<br> - I know how to talk if I know your angle.<br> - No angle, just the facts.<br> - Oh, a pan, huh?<br> - Not exactly.<br> - That's all right. Write whatever you want.<br> Look, go on upstairs.<br> I wanna get shaved.<br> You can't hurt me. You<br> can't help me. Nobody can.<br> I'm only talking here 'cause<br> Jim Devery asked me to.<br> I pay a guy 100 grand<br> a year for advice.<br> - I'm a sucker if I don't take it, right?<br> - That's right.<br> Butt out, will ya?<br> Devery likes it when<br> I get wrote about.<br> - Well, fella, what do you wanna know?<br> - How much money you got?<br> - What?<br> - How much money you got?<br> How should I know?<br> What am I, an accountant?<br> - You don't know?<br> - Not exactly.<br> - Fifty million?<br> - To tell you the truth, I don't know.<br> - Ten million?<br> - Maybe.<br> - One million?<br> - More!<br> - How much more?<br> - Plenty.<br> - Okay.<br> - And I made every nickel of it.<br> - Nobody never give me nothing.<br> - Nice work.<br> I can see right off you're<br> gonna give me the business.<br> - Oh, wait a minute...<br> - That's all right. I like it.<br> - You got me all wrong.<br> - Pan me. Tell 'em I'm a roughneck.<br> Everybody gets scared. For me,<br> that's good. Everybody scares easy.<br> - Oh, not everybody.<br> - Enough.<br> Look, you can't hurt me.<br> All you can do is<br> build me up or shut up.<br> - Hey, Eddie. Have a drink.<br> - No, thanks, really.<br> Do what I'm tellin' you.<br> Who pays you around here?<br> When we're home, he<br> shaves me every day.<br> - I got my own barber chair. Right?<br> - That's right.<br> Go ahead, pal. I thought<br> you wanted to interview me.<br> Where were you born?<br> Jersey. Plainfield,<br> New Jersey. 1907.<br> I went to work when<br> I was 12 years old.<br> I been workin' ever since.<br> My first job was a paper route.<br> I bought another kid out with<br> a swift kick in the keister.<br> - And you've been workin' ever since.<br> - Yeah.<br> Tell you how I'm<br> top man in my racket.<br> Been in it over 25<br> years. Same racket.<br> - Steel.<br> - Junk.<br> - Not steel, junk.<br> - Oh.<br> Now, look, don't butter me up.<br> - I'm a junk man. I ain't ashamed to admit it.<br> - All right.<br> Let me give you a<br> little advice, sonny boy.<br> Never bull a bull artist. I can<br> sling it with the best of 'em.<br> - For 25 years, you say.<br> - Yeah.<br> I tell ya, I'm a kid<br> with a paper route.<br> I got this little wagon. Goin' home nights<br> I go through the alleys pickin' up junk.<br> I'm not the only one doing it.<br> The other kids are doing it too.<br> The only difference is, they<br> keep it. Not me. I sell it.<br> And the first thing you know, I'm<br> makin' seven, eight bucks from junk...<br> and three bucks from papers.<br> Right off I can see<br> which is the right racket.<br> I'm just a kid, but I can see that.<br> Pretty soon the guy I'm sellin' to is<br> handing me anywhere from 15 to 20 a week.<br> Then he turns around and offers<br> me a job for 10. Dumb jerk.<br> I'd be sellin' him his own stuff<br> back half the time, and he never knew.<br> - How do you mean?<br> - Look, in the night, I'm under the fence,<br> I drag it out, I load it up.<br> In the morning, I go in<br> the front way and collect.<br> - 12 years old you were.<br> - Yeah, something like that.<br> - So, pretty soon you own the whole yard.<br> - Right.<br> Now, this guy, the jerk, he works<br> for me now. You know who else?<br> The kid whose paper route I swiped.<br> I figure I owe him.<br> That's the way I am.<br> Pretty good years for the<br> junk business, the last few.<br> I ain't kickin'.<br> - Do you anticipate any decline now?<br> - Talk plain, pal.<br> - Is it still going to be good, do you think?<br> - We'll make it good.<br> - Who's we?<br> - "We" is me, that's who.<br> Look, fancy talk don't go with me.<br> - Come on in.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Well, I'll get out of your way...<br> - No, don't go. I like ya.<br> Stick around, play your cards<br> right, I'll put you on the payroll.<br> Once over light and no<br> talk. Just brush 'em up.<br> - I get a manicure every day.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Over there someplace.<br> Okay, fella, go ahead. Go ahead.<br> I've been wondering, uh, what<br> you're doing in Washington.<br> What are you, some wonder boy?<br> - Not so tight.<br> - Sorry, sir.<br> Sightseeing. That's what<br> I'm doing in Washington.<br> Some talk you may be<br> around for a long time,<br> - that you've come to find out...<br> - So far I've been nice to ya. Don't pump me.<br> How's it going?<br> How are you getting<br> on with King Junk?<br> Great. Found out he was born<br> in Plainfield, New Jersey.<br> - He sure is a tough man to dig.<br> - I can't believe that.<br> He loves to talk. Oh, Billie.<br> This is my friend, Paul<br> Verrall. Billie Dawn.<br> How do you do?<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Where do you think you're going with that?<br> - To my place.<br> - Put it back.<br> - I just wanted to...<br> - I know what you wanted. Put it back.<br> - Why can't I just...<br> We got somebody comin',<br> somebody important.<br> - I don't want you around here stinkin'!<br> - Well, can't I just...<br> Go to your room and change your<br> clothes and don't give me no trouble!<br> Do what I'm tellin' ya!<br> Barber, what'll you<br> take to cut his throat?<br> - Ooh! Ooh!<br> - Some kind of jokes I don't like, Jim.<br> - Don't get excited.<br> - Don't tell me what to do.<br> Just a joke, Harry.<br> - That's all.<br> - I'm not quite finished.<br> I said beat it. You too.<br> Eddie, take care of 'em.<br> - I'll be going too.<br> - No, don't go. Stick around.<br> You're the only friend<br> I got left around here.<br> Well, I live just<br> around the corner.<br> If anyone starts beating you, just lean out<br> the window and scream. I'll come running.<br> - Bye, Jim. Thanks.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - I need Billie's signature on a few things.<br> - Sure.<br> Billie!<br> You sore?<br> Not sore, Harry.<br> - You look funny.<br> - I know.<br> Don't you feel good?<br> You want an aspirin?<br> No, no, I'm fine.<br> In fact, considering I've<br> been dead for 16 years,<br> I'm in remarkable health.<br> Billie!<br> What?<br> Billie!<br> - What?<br> - Come over here right away!<br> Hey, would you please<br> fix this safety catch?<br> - He's sure got good lungs.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Thanks.<br> - There's a shortcut through the service.<br> - This way.<br> - Oh.<br> - That's the door down there, honey.<br> - Thanks, honey.<br> Sometime I don't<br> understand you at all.<br> Sometime?<br> - What do you want?<br> - Jim.<br> A few things I want<br> you to sign, honey.<br> That's all I do<br> around here is sign.<br> Too bad about you.<br> - What time's he comin', this congressman guy?<br> - Any time now.<br> I'd better get fixed up, huh?<br> She look all right to you?<br> - Look who's talkin'.<br> - You tell me if something's wrong.<br> I don't wanna start<br> off on no left foot.<br> Well, what got into him?<br> Nothing. Just wants to<br> make a good impression.<br> So let him.<br> Two places on this one, please.<br> What happened to all that<br> stuff I signed last week?<br> All used up.<br> I bet I must've signed<br> about a million of these.<br> What you get for being a<br> multiple corporate officer.<br> I am? What do you know?<br> You've come a long way<br> from the chorus, all right.<br> I wasn't only in the<br> chorus. I spoke lines.<br> - Really?<br> - Of course.<br> How many?<br> - How many what?<br> - Lines did you speak.<br> Five.<br> - I never knew that.<br> - Ask anybody.<br> I believe you.<br> I could've been a star probably<br> if I'd have stuck to it.<br> - Why didn't you?<br> - Well, Harry didn't want me bein' in the show.<br> He didn't want to share<br> me with the general public.<br> I see.<br> He's changed, Harry.<br> Don't you think so?<br> - How?<br> - I don't know. He used to be,<br> like, more satisfied.<br> Now he's always runnin'<br> around like this.<br> And what did he have to<br> come to Washington, D.C. for?<br> - Long story.<br> - Well, don't tell it to me.<br> I don't care where we go.<br> I just wish he'd settle down.<br> - He's ambitious.<br> - I know.<br> He talks all the time now.<br> He never used to.<br> Now he's got me up half the night<br> tellin' me what a big man he is,<br> how he's gonna be<br> bigger, run everything.<br> - He may at that.<br> - And personally, I don't care<br> one way or the other.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Look, now, don't you start.<br> Better if you drink<br> later, after they're gone.<br> - Who, this congressman guy?<br> - And Mrs. Hedges.<br> - Harry tells me this fella works for him.<br> - In a way.<br> So what he's puttin' it on for?<br> Now, all you have to do is be<br> nice.

It means...<br> Well, it just means pertaining to our<br> form of government, which is a democracy.<br> Oh.<br> What's "pertaining"?<br> Has to do with.<br> "Pertaining." Nice word.<br> - All right. "Manifesto."<br> - I don't know.<br> - Why didn't you look it up?<br> - I did look it up. I still don't know.<br> Well, look, when I say "manifesto,"<br> I mean a set of rules and<br> principles and ideals and hopes...<br> on which the United<br> States is based.<br> The ideas of those men who<br> wrote that Constitution up there.<br> - So you think it's turning yellow?<br> - Yes.<br> I think a lot of the original inspiration<br> has been neglected and forgotten.<br> - And that's bad.<br> - And that's bad.<br> - "Even a... cursory...<br> - Cursory.<br> Examination of contemporary...<br> society in terms of the Greek...<br> philosophy, which<br> defines the whole...<br> as a representation of its parts...<br> sends one immediately<br> to the consideration...<br> of the individual as a citizen...<br> and the citizen as an individual."<br> Well?<br> I looked up every word.<br> Listen.<br> Thousands of years ago,<br> a Greek philosopher said...<br> that the world could only be as<br> good as the people who lived in it.<br> Makes sense.<br> So I said, you take one<br> look at America today...<br> and you figure you'd better take a look<br> at the people in it, one by one, sort of.<br> - Yeah.<br> - That's all.<br> - That's this?<br> - Sure.<br> Well, why didn't you say so?<br> What's the name of this<br> number, did you say?<br> Beethoven's Second<br> Symphony, Opus 36.<br> I didn't ask you who made it up.<br> I just asked you<br> what's the name of it.<br> - Here. Wait a minute.<br> - Huh?<br> - There.<br> - Thanks.<br> - I can't get over it.<br> - Music that bad?<br> The music? No, it was swell.<br> Well, then what?<br> I got a letter<br> today from my father.<br> - New York?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I can't get over it.<br> - Why?<br> Well, it's the first time he ever<br> wrote me in about eight years.<br> We had a fight, sort of.<br> He didn't want me to go with Harry.<br> What does he do?<br> - My father?<br> - Yeah.<br> Gas company. He<br> used to read meters.<br> But in this letter, it says how he<br> can't get around so good anymore,<br> so they gave him a<br> different job, elevator man.<br> He's a goofy old guy.<br> He used to take a little frying<br> pan and a can of Sterno...<br> to work every morning<br> and cook his own lunch.<br> He said everybody<br> should have a hot lunch.<br> I swear, I don't<br> know how he did it.<br> There were four of us...<br> me and my three brothers.<br> He had to do everything.<br> My mother died. I never knew her.<br> He used to feed us and give us<br> our baths and buy our clothes.<br> Everything...<br> That's why all my<br> life, I used to think...<br> how someday I'd<br> like to pay him back.<br> It's funny how it worked out.<br> One night I brought home<br> $100 and gave it to him.<br> You know what he did?<br> Well, it sure didn't<br> do the plumbing no good.<br> I thought he was gonna<br> hit me sure, but he didn't.<br> His whole life he<br> never hit me once.<br> How'd he happen to write you?<br> I mean, after all this time?<br> - Oh, 'cause I wrote him.<br> - Oh?<br> He says he's thought<br> about me every day.<br> Oh, gosh.<br> I haven't thought about him maybe<br> but once, even in five years.<br> Oh, that's nothing against him.<br> I haven't thought of anything.<br> Be nice to see him, maybe.<br> I guess so.<br> He says I should write him again...<br> and I should have a<br> hot lunch every day...<br> and I should let him know how I am.<br> But he doesn't want to see me...<br> if I'm still living<br> in any way unethical.<br> I looked it up.<br> He always used to say, "Never do<br> nothin' you wouldn't want printed...<br> on the front page of<br> the New York Times."<br> Hey, I just realized...<br> I practically told you the whole<br> story of my life by now, practically.<br> I enjoyed it very much.<br> How about the story of your life?<br> Oh, no. Much too long.<br> And mostly untrue.<br> Hey, this is even more gorgeous...<br> than the Radio City<br> Music Hall, even.<br> And you notice, it smells nice.<br> It does.<br> - Come on. Sit down.<br> - No.<br> You're tired.<br> I'm not a bit tired.<br> See?<br> You know that little thing<br> you gave me about Napoleon?<br> - No. What?<br> - By Robert G. Ingersoll.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Well, I'm not sure I get that.<br> - Well, there's no deep meaning there.<br> - There must be.<br> He says about how he goes and<br> looks in Napoleon's tomb...<br> - Yeah?<br> - And he thinks of Napoleon's whole sad life.<br> - Yeah.<br> - And then in the end,<br> he says he himself would've<br> rather been a happy farmer.<br> "And I said...<br> I said I would rather have been a<br> French peasant and worn wooden shoes.<br> I would rather have<br> lived in a hut...<br> with a vine growing<br> over the door...<br> and the grapes growing purple...<br> in the kisses of the autumn sun.<br> I would rather have<br> been that poor peasant...<br> with my loving wife by my side...<br> knitting as the day<br> died out of the sky,<br> with my children upon my<br> knee and their arms about me.<br> I would rather have<br> been that man...<br> and gone down to the tongueless<br> silence of the dreamless dust...<br> than to have been that imperial<br> impersonation of force and murder...<br> known as Napoleon the Great."<br> How do you remember all that stuff?<br> So he'd rather been a happy<br> peasant than Napoleon.<br> - So who wouldn't?<br> - So Harry wouldn't, for one.<br> - What makes you think that?<br> - Ask him.<br> He probably never<br> heard of Napoleon.<br> What's worse, he probably<br> never heard of a peasant.<br> - Do you hate him like poison?<br> - Who, Harry?<br> - Yeah.<br> - No.<br> - You don't like him.<br> - No.<br> - On account of me and him?<br> - One reason.<br> - There are lots more.<br> - What?<br> Think about it, Billie.<br> You'll see Harry's a menace.<br> Oh, he's not so bad. I seen worse.<br> Has he ever thought<br> of anyone but himself?<br> - Who does?<br> - Millions of people, Billie.<br> The whole history of<br> the world is a story...<br> of the struggle between the<br> selfish and the unselfish.<br> - I can hear you.<br> - All that's bad around us is bred by selfishness.<br> Sometimes selfishness can<br> even get to be a cause,<br> an organized force,<br> even a government.<br> And then it's called fascism.<br> - Can you understand that?<br> - Sort of.<br> Well, think about it.<br> You're crazy about me, aren't ya?<br> - Yes.<br> - That's why you get so mad at Harry.<br> Listen, I hate his life, what he<br> does, what he stands for, not him.<br> He just doesn't know any better.<br> I go for you too.<br> I'm glad of it.<br> Ooh!<br> "I have sworn upon<br> the altar of God...<br> eternal hostility against<br> every form of tyranny...<br> over the mind of man."<br> - So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> You know, I heard<br> quite a bit about him.<br> I mean, even before<br> I hit town, even.<br> Come in.<br> What are you trying to do<br> with those books, hatch 'em?<br> Blue?<br> Nice, huh?<br> "Beethoven, Op. 36."<br> What's up, Billie?<br> It's all on account of you<br> I started doin' all this.<br> - I guess you know.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> A lot of good it did me.<br> I never had this kind of<br> trouble before, I can tell you.<br> - Trouble?<br> - Sure.<br> After that first<br> night when I met ya,<br> I figured everything<br> was gonna work out dandy.<br> Then when you wouldn't...<br> step across the line,<br> I figured maybe the way to<br> you is through your head.<br> Well, no.<br> Well, anyway, what's the diff now?<br> Difference. But I like ya, anyway.<br> - It's too late for the rest.<br> - Why?<br> Why? Oh, look, Paul.<br> There's a certain time between a fella<br> and a girl when it either comes off or not.<br> If it doesn't then,<br> then it never does.<br> Maybe we haven't<br> got to our time yet.<br> I think we did, and<br> you dropped the ball.<br> Don't be so sure.<br> I never thought I'd go through<br> a thing like this for anybody.<br> - Like what?<br> - Like gettin' all mixed up in my head...<br> like wondering and worrying<br> and thinking, stuff like that.<br> Last night, I went to<br> bed. I started to think.<br> I couldn't fall<br> asleep for 10 minutes.<br> I never know if it's good<br> to find out so much so quick.<br> Nobody's born smart, Billie.<br> You know what the stupidest<br> thing on Earth is? An infant!<br> - What do ya got against babies all of the sudden?<br> - Nothing.<br> I got nothing against a brain<br> that's three weeks old and empty.<br> But after it hangs around for 30<br> years and hasn't absorbed anything,<br> - I begin to wonder about it.<br> - What makes you think I'm 30?<br> - I didn't mean you.<br> - Oh, yes, you did!<br> - I swear it.<br> - You certainly know how to get me sore!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Thirty! Do I look 30 to you?<br> - No. I don't know.<br> - Then why'd you say it for?<br> - How old are you?<br> - Twenty-nine.<br> Don't stop it. I meant,<br> don't stop studying.<br> Will ya?<br> I don't know why it's<br> so important to you.<br> It's sort of a cause. I<br> want everybody to be smart.<br> I want 'em to be as<br> smart as they can be.<br> A world full of ignorant people<br> is too dangerous to live in.<br> I know. That's why I<br> wish I was doin' better.<br> - You're doing wonderfully.<br> - It's no use.<br> Most people would just laugh at me<br> if they knew what I was trying to do.<br> - I'm not laughing.<br> - I am.<br> I started laughing at myself.<br> Who do I think I am anyway?<br> - Once in a while, just for a change.<br> - Don't try so hard, Billie, please!<br> - You miss the whole point.<br> - I like to like what's better to like.<br> There's room for all<br> sorts of things in you.<br> The idea of learning is<br> to be bigger, not smaller.<br> - You think Fm gettin' bigger?<br> - Yes.<br> Glad to hear it.<br> - But all them books?<br> - It's not only books, Billie.<br> - I told you a hundred times.<br> - It's mostly.<br> It is not. Now look, who said this:<br> "The proper study<br> of mankind is man."<br> - I don't know.<br> - You should.<br> - Why?<br> - I told you.<br> - I forgot.<br> - Pope.<br> - The pope?<br> - Not the pope.<br> Alexander Pope.<br> - "The proper study"...<br> - "Of mankind is man."<br> "Of mankind is man."<br> - 'Course, that means women too.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, I know.<br> I've been doin' some studyin'<br> of a different mankind lately,<br> like the ones you told me...<br> Thomas Jefferson last week...<br> and this week, Tom Paine.<br> And all by myself, I got<br> to thinkin' about Harry.<br> He works so hard to get<br> what he wants, for instance.<br> But he doesn't know what he wants.<br> More of what he's got, probably.<br> - Money.<br> - Money, more people to push around, more money.<br> Oh, he's not so bad<br> as you think he is.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, Harry. We were<br> just talking about you.<br> Yeah? That ain't<br> what I pay you for.<br> She knows enough about me<br> already. Too much, in fact.<br> - Jim phone?<br> - No.<br> I had a date with him.<br> - What'd you find out about Torn Paine?<br> - Oh, he was quite a fella.<br> - Where was he born? Do you remember?<br> - London, or England.<br> - Someplace like that.<br> - What do you mean, "London or England"?<br> - That's the same thing.<br> - It is?<br> London is in England. London's a<br> city. England's a whole country.<br> - I forgot.<br> - Oh, brother, you've got patience.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - How can anybody get to be so dumb?<br> Well, we can't all<br> know everything, Harry.<br> Who's Tom Paine, for instance?<br> - What?<br> - You heard me, Tom Paine.<br> - What do I care who he is?<br> - I know.<br> So what. If I wanted to know who<br> he is, I'd know. I just don't care.<br> Go on, go on. Don't let me butt in.<br> Which of his books<br> did you like best?<br> Oh, well, I didn't read<br> by him yet, only about him.<br> - But I made a list.<br> - Who is Rabbit Maranville?<br> - Who?<br> - Rabbit Maranville.<br> - I don't know any Rabbits!<br> - Think you're so smart, huh?<br> He used to play shortstop<br> for the Braves, didn't he?<br> What are you, some kind<br> of genius or something?<br> - No.<br> - I hire and fire geniuses every day.<br> - I'm sure you do. Where's the list?<br> - Here.<br> Well, suppose you start<br> with The Age of Reason.<br> - The Age of Reason?<br> - Mm-hmm. Then next...<br> - Who's Willie Hoppe?<br> - National billiard champion.<br> - And it's pronounced "hoppy."<br> - That's what I said.<br> - But I didn't ask you, I asked her.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Where were we?<br> - The Age of Reason.<br> Yes. Next, The Rights of Man.<br> - The Rights of Man.<br> - I think that'll...<br> - What's a peninsula?<br> - Shh!<br> Don't give me that "shh."<br> You think you're so smart.<br> - What's a peninsula? Not you, her.<br> - It's a...<br> It's that new medicine.<br> It is not.<br> What then?<br> It's a body of land surrounded<br> on three sides by water.<br> So, what's that to know?<br> So, what's that<br> "Sam Paine" to know?<br> There's some difference between...<br> Tom Paine, not "Sam Paine."<br> Tom Paine practically<br> started this whole country.<br> - You mean he's dead?<br> - Of course.<br> What are you learnin'<br> her about dead people for?<br> All I want you to do is to teach<br> her how to act with live people.<br> Well, education is a difficult<br> thing to control, Harry.<br> - One thing leads to...<br> - Work on her, not me.<br> - No extra charge.<br> - I don't need nothin' you can tell me.<br> Oh, I'm sure we could tell each other<br> some very interesting things, Harry.<br> - What's the idea of that mean?<br> - Just trying to be friendly.<br> Who asked you?<br> You know, the more I see of<br> you, I don't like you as much.<br> For a chump who got no<br> place, you're awful fresh.<br> Now, you better watch<br> out. I got my eye on you.<br> All right. We'll both watch out.<br> If I wanted, I could knock<br> your block off, if I wanted.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - All right, just do what you're<br> supposed to do, and that's all.<br> - Well, we'll stop for now.<br> - No, go on, go on.<br> - I wanna see how you do it.<br> - Not just now, if you don't mind.<br> I've gotta go and lie down. You<br> don't realize how hard I work.<br> Ha, ha. Some joke.<br> Two hundred bucks a week,<br> and I can't even watch.<br> Take you on separately,<br> Harry. Glad to.<br> Got a special course for<br> backward millionaires.<br> "London or England."<br> Why don't you give up.<br> - Harry?<br> - What?<br> What's this business we're in<br> down here? Could you tell me?<br> What do you mean, 'we'?<br> Oh, I figure I'm a sort<br> of partner, in a way.<br> - A silent partner.<br> - So?<br> So shut up!<br> - I got a right to know.<br> - You got a right to keep out of my hair too.<br> Put your nose in the<br> book and keep it there!<br> I don't wanna do anything<br> if it's against the law.<br> - That's one sure thing.<br> - You'll do what I tell ya!<br> I think I know what it<br> is, only I'm not sure.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You're doin' all right, ain't ya?<br> Somethin' you want<br> you ain't got, maybe?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What?<br> I wanna be like the happy peasant.<br> All right, I'll buy it for you.<br> Now, will you quit crabbin'!<br> Well, I finished finally.<br> - Thanks loads for the loan of it.<br> - How'd you like it, Helen?<br> Uh, not me. I don't<br> go for these stories...<br> where everyone has a big<br> beef against the world.<br> Me, I like to look<br> on the cheerful side.<br> Yeah, well you see<br> of course the point...<br> All right! All right!<br> Can the coffee klatch!<br> - You, knock off!<br> - Sorry, Mr. Brock.<br> You don't have to get<br> so pally with everybody.<br> - Paul says it's all right.<br> - Never mind, Paul says. I don't like it.<br> - You know what you are?<br> - What?<br> - Antisocial!<br> - You can say that again.<br> - Hello.<br> - Where do you guys think you've been?<br> - You know what time it is?<br> - Sorry.<br> - You're always sorry.<br> - My fault.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - How are ya, Billie?<br> - Superb. A new word.<br> - All right! All right! What happened!<br> - It's just this, Harry.<br> - It may take a little more time.<br> - And a little more money.<br> - Yeah. Why more?<br> - Well, the amendment has to be redrafted.<br> Listen, I don't like you. You make<br> me feel like some kind of sucker.<br> - I'm sure Norval is doing his best.<br> - His best ain't good enough.<br> Don't be unreasonable, Harry. There<br> are a great number of votes up there.<br> - Norval is just one guy.<br> - Well, he's the wrong guy.<br> I'm sick and tired of waiting.<br> Let's get the wheels rollin'.<br> We're all in this deal. You pull your<br> weight or I'll get somebody who can!<br> Do you hear me? Good!<br> - Quite a temper, hasn't he?<br> - Don't mind him.<br> He's always lived at<br> the top of his voice.<br> So long, Norval.<br> Psst. Psst.<br> I don't think Harry should<br> talk to you like that.<br> - After all, you're a congressman.<br> - Oh, well.<br> I don't think anybody should talk to<br> a congressman like that or be able to.<br> A member of Congress<br> is a wonderful thing.<br> Thank you. You know, I<br> think I could use a drink.<br> Oh, sure, Congressman. Come on in.<br> The way it looks to me,<br> if he pushes you around...<br> it's like he's pushing a<br> few million people around.<br> - How do you mean?<br> - The ones who picked you.<br> - Well, not quite that many.<br> - How many then?<br> Well, that's quite<br> a few to push around.<br> You're not one of my constituents<br> by any chance, are you?<br> I mean, are you one of the<br> people who voted for me?<br> Oh, I never voted for anybody.<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't know. I wouldn't know how, I guess.<br> It's simple. You<br> just press a button.<br> Yeah, but which one?<br> Well, you listen to the speeches,<br> you make up your own mind.<br> That's all there is to it.<br> Yeah, but why do you take it from<br> Harry? That's what I wanna know.<br> You're more important than<br> him. You're a congressman.<br> Yes, and as such I have<br> a great many duties...<br> and responsibilities and...<br> The operation of government<br> is very complex.<br> Why should it be?<br> I understand it pretty good in<br> a book so when Paul tells me.<br> But when I see somethin' like<br> this happen, it's like, different.<br> - How?<br> - Well, when it gets down to<br> what should be the laws and...<br> what shouldn't, is Harry more<br> important than anybody else?<br> - No.<br> - Then how come he's got so much to say?<br> Who ever voted for him?<br> Well, we'll have a nice<br> long talk about it sometime.<br> All right.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> And thank you.<br> - Quite a little girl.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - Billie?<br> - Come in.<br> Uh, will you come inside?<br> A few things for you.<br> Sign those, will ya, honey?<br> - What is this?<br> - Same old stuff.<br> - What?<br> - Take too long to explain.<br> No, it wouldn't. I like<br> having things explained to me.<br> I found that out.<br> - Some other time.<br> - Now.<br> It's just an agreement<br> about some merger.<br> Merger? What's that?<br> Several companies<br> being formed into one.<br> - All Harry's?<br> - No.<br> - Whose then?<br> - A few of Harry's and some others.<br> French, Italian, and so on.<br> A cartel!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - About cartels!<br> If that's what it is, I'm against<br> it. Paul explained me the whole thing.<br> It's perfectly all<br> right. Don't worry.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Ask Harry.<br> - I will.<br> - He won't like it.<br> - Why not?<br> - Well, he just won't, that's all.<br> - He doesn't like people butting in.<br> - I'm not people.<br> Listen to me, Billie. Be smart.<br> How can I be smart if nobody<br> ever tells me anything?<br> - I'm telling you something.<br> - What?<br> Sign this stuff and<br> don't start up with him.<br> - Tomorrow.<br> - Why tomorrow?<br> I wanna look it over,<br> know what I'm doin'.<br> - It's all right.<br> - It must be somethin' fishy.<br> If not, you'd tell me.<br> Take my word for it.<br> No.<br> I know what you feel bad about.<br> You don't like to be<br> doin' all his dirty work...<br> - 'cause you know you're better than him.<br> - That's enough!<br> But I'm not so sure.<br> Maybe you're worse.<br> Interesting?<br> Not very.<br> I suppose you're used to<br> reading more high-tone stuff.<br> Yes, I am.<br> - What's the matter, kid?<br> - Nothin'.<br> - All of a sudden...<br> - I don't like that Jim.<br> Why?<br> - What'd he do to ya?<br> - He didn't do nothin'... anything to me.<br> - It's what he's done to himself.<br> - Done what?<br> Paul told me he could've been<br> assistant attorney general...<br> of the whole United States.<br> - Who?<br> - Jim.<br> - So what's wrong with that?<br> - So nothing's wrong with it.<br> Look at him now. Hangs<br> around, helps you... promote.<br> Lets you walk over him<br> 'cause you pay him for it.<br> Oh, so we finally get around to me.<br> I'm not sure I like you either.<br> You're selfish.<br> That's your trouble.<br> - Since when is all this?<br> - Since now.<br> I used to think you<br> were a big man, Harry.<br> I'm beginning to see you're not.<br> All through history there's been<br> bigger men than you, and better.<br> - Now too.<br> - Who, for instance?<br> - Thousands.<br> - Name one.<br> My father.<br> Twenty-five a week.<br> Listen, cutie, don't get nervous<br> just 'cause you read a book.<br> - You're as dumb as you ever were.<br> - You think so, huh?<br> Yeah, but I don't<br> mind. You know why?<br> - 'Cause you're the greatest...<br> - Oh, leave me alone!<br> - Come here! I've never seen you like this!<br> - No!<br> I've never been like this!<br> I feel like I wanna go away!<br> - Where? In a couple of weeks we'll go to Florida.<br> - I don't know!<br> - I mean alone! Maybe!<br> - I think you've gone nuts!<br> - All right! Calm down!<br> - I can't!<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't know!<br> I just know I hate my life.<br> There's a better cut. I know it.<br> And if you read some of these<br> books, you'd know it too.<br> Maybe it's right what<br> you say: I'm still dumb.<br> But I know one thing<br> I never knew before.<br> There's a better kind of<br> life than the one I got.<br> Or you!<br> I suppose you'd think you'd be better<br> off with that lousy saxophone player?<br> - At least he was honest!<br> - Nah, he was a dime-a-dozen chump!<br> He worked for a living!<br> That's one thing!<br> I've worked since I was 12!<br> Nobody never gave me nothin'!<br> If a man goes and robs<br> a house, that's work too.<br> In my whole life...<br> In my whole life, I<br> never robbed a house!<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - You can hardly understand anything.<br> Get off that high horse,<br> you dumb little putt!<br> You... menace!<br> I picked you up out of the<br> gutter! I can throw you back!<br> You never had a decent<br> meal until you met me!<br> Yeah, but I haven't had one<br> with you! You eat terrible!<br> You got no manners! Taking<br> your shoes off all the time.<br> That's another thing,<br> and picking your teeth.<br> You're just not couth!<br> I'm as couth as you are!<br> And that cheap perfume<br> you put on yourself.<br> Cheap. I don't own<br> nothin' cheap, except you.<br> You don't own me.<br> Nobody can own anybody.<br> There's a law that says.<br> What do I care what the law<br> says! If I was scared of the law,<br> - I wouldn't be where I am!<br> - Where are ya?<br> You talked enough! You<br> don't like it here, beat it!<br> Wait a minute!<br> - First, this! Right now!<br> - Not now! No!<br> - Come here!<br> - I'm not signin' anything<br> till I know what I'm signin'...<br> - from now on!<br> - Do what I'm tellin' ya!<br> - Harry, please don't!<br> - No!<br> No!<br> Here!<br> All right, now go on. Blow!<br> - What?<br> - I don't want you bawlin'<br> around here. That's what!<br> I've been too good to ya.<br> You don't appreciate nothin'!<br> So go on, blow! Sit on a park<br> bench and learn how to behave!<br> Go on, beat it!<br> This way out.<br> - I gotta put somethin' on.<br> - Well, hurry it up.<br> I don't want you around here<br> like this. You bother me!<br> Big fascist!<br> All set?<br> Certainly, all set. What do you<br> think? I'm gonna let a broad talk back?<br> - Where is she?<br> - I told her to take a walk.<br> One thing I can't stand is a crier.<br> - What's she crying about?<br> - How do I know?<br> - She's becoming a strange girl.<br> - Aw, she's all right.<br> It's just all these books, they<br> got her nervous, that's all.<br> It looks like your passion for<br> educating her was a mistake.<br> I didn't know it was gonna<br> turn out like this, did I?<br> Remind me to fire that-that<br> four-eyed Verrall skunk.<br> - Why blame him?<br> - He taught her too much.<br> - You know what she called me before?<br> - A fascist! She did?<br> That don't make sense. I was<br> born in Plainfield, New Jersey.<br> She knows that.<br> What's the matter, Harry?<br> I love that broad.<br> Hey, you think we could find<br> somebody to make her dumb again?<br> And don't be late if you<br> don't want no bloody nose.<br> Would you do me a favor, Harry?<br> - What?<br> - Drop dead.<br> I have sworn upon<br> the altar of God...<br> Eternal hostility...<br> against every form of tyranny...<br> over the mind of man.<br> Oh, hello? Uh, Chestnut 7-1-8-0.<br> I'd like to speak to<br> Thomas Jefferson, please.<br> Oh, no. I mean, Thomas Verrall.<br> No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.<br> Well, it's very important.<br> Oh, well, I'll hold on.<br> - Jim!<br> - Yes?<br> - What time is it already?<br> - 11:30.<br> I'll slug her senseless<br> when she gets back.<br> - If.<br> - Oh, I've had this with her before.<br> She always winds<br> up where I want her.<br> I hope so.<br> - Jim!<br> - Yes?<br> What time is it?<br> - 11:30.<br> - You said that before.<br> - She's been gone eight hours.<br> - Maybe she's seeing a double feature.<br> Yeah.<br> That don't take eight hours.<br> - Could've got in an accident.<br> - You'd hear.<br> Could've got attacked.<br> - Happens all the time.<br> - Not to Billie.<br> Maybe the other way<br> around, but not to Billie.<br> - She here?<br> - What do you mean, she here?<br> - No! Go look some more.<br> - I've been all over town.<br> Well, go over it again!<br> - Do what I'm tellin' ya!<br> - Sure.<br> Just changin' my socks.<br> - Harry.<br> - What?<br> Marry her.<br> - Still harpin', huh?<br> - I'm thinking of your legal safety.<br> - On paper, she owns...<br> - Yeah, I know what she owns.<br> You've got to do it, Harry.<br> They always hook you<br> in the end, them broads.<br> This whole trouble is on<br> account of a dame reads a book.<br> It's the new world, Harry.<br> Force and reason changing places.<br> - What?<br> - Knowledge is power.<br> I don't like the way things<br> are goin' around here...<br> you stewed all the time<br> and that broad out of line.<br> And that's some fine<br> congressman you bought me.<br> - I think he's cute.<br> - Yeah, well I'd like to trade him in, no kiddin'.<br> - On what, for instance?<br> - For instance, on a senator.<br> On a senator.<br> Take those blinders off, Harry,<br> and let in a little light.<br> Just for a second.<br> It won't hurt much.<br> You don't go around this<br> town buying up senators...<br> and congressmen as if<br> they wore price tags.<br> These guys are honest,<br> sincerely trying to do a job.<br> Once in a while, you find<br> a rotten apple, like Hedges.<br> Then you can have them,<br> but just once in a while,<br> in a great while.<br> Are you sure you're ringin'<br> Mr. Brock's suite, Operator?<br> How about the bedroom?<br> Well, ring a few more<br> times, will ya, honey?<br> - I wanna make sure.<br> - He's not in.<br> Just one more ring.<br> Let's go.<br> - The stuffs in his briefcase...<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - In his bedroom.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - I probably won't see ya again, Paul.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - So I wanna say good-bye.<br> - What?<br> - And thanks for everything.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Just away from here,<br> that's all I know.<br> Where?<br> - You can tell me.<br> - I don't know.<br> I thought I might go see<br> my father for a while.<br> - I've got a better idea.<br> - What?<br> Let's get married.<br> You must be daffy.<br> I love you, Billie.<br> You don't love me.<br> You just love my brain.<br> That too.<br> Well, I'll think it over,<br> but I can tell you now...<br> the answer's no.<br> What are you doin'?<br> Well, if you don't know,<br> I must be doing it wrong.<br> Fine time!<br> - Hello, Harry.<br> - Where ya been?<br> I took a walk like you told me.<br> I met Paul.<br> Okay, buster, knock off!<br> Good night, Paul.<br> Good night, Billie.<br> Good night, Harry.<br> What's the matter,<br> Harry, ya miss me?<br> I decided somethin' to tell ya, somethin'<br> good. I don't like to wait when I get an idea.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> - Now that I see ya,<br> I'm not so sure I should tell it.<br> - Why not?<br> - Runnin' out, talkin' fresh, slammin' doors.<br> I knew you'd be back though.<br> - Ya did, huh?<br> - I told Jim. He was worried, not me.<br> - Not yet.<br> - What took ya so long?<br> - I had a lot to think.<br> - For instance?<br> - Just where I stand around here.<br> - I've been tryin' to tell ya.<br> - What?<br> - Where ya stand around here.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - First, that Verrall stuff is<br> out. It gets in my way.<br> I don't like to see you<br> upset. It's bad for you.<br> - The next thing, we're gonna be married.<br> - No.<br> But you gotta learn how<br> to behave your... No?<br> - What do you mean, no?<br> - I don't wanna.<br> That's what I mean. No!<br> In fact, I've never<br> been so insulted.<br> Who are you to say no if I tell ya?<br> Don't knock yourself out. You<br> got a lot of surprises comin'.<br> Look! Just tell me first.<br> - What?<br> - How can you not wanna marry me?<br> Well, for one thing,<br> you're too dumb.<br> I just got a different kind of<br> life in mind, Harry, entirely.<br> I'm sorry, but you<br> just wouldn't fit in.<br> Listen, Billie, I don't understand<br> what's happenin' around here.<br> - I do.<br> - What did I do? What did I?<br> All right, I talk rough<br> to you once in a while.<br> Maybe I hit you a<br> couple of times... easy.<br> Is that any reason<br> to treat me like this?<br> I done good for you too.<br> Couldn't we straighten this out?<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> Well, all that stuff<br> I've been studying...<br> what Paul's been tellin'<br> me, it just mixed me up.<br> But when you hit me<br> before, it was like...<br> everything knocked itself<br> together in my head and made sense.<br> All of the sudden I<br> realized what it means,<br> how some people are always<br> givin' and some takin'.<br> And it's not fair,<br> so I'm not gonna let ya<br> anymore, or anybody else.<br> Listen, kid, I got an idea.<br> Ya wanna come to Florida?<br> We used to have some good<br> times together. Remember, honey?<br> I think you should<br> marry me, don't you?<br> Look, Billie, I want you to marry<br> me. I don't wanna argue about it.<br> I heard enough. Do what I'm tellin'<br> ya or you'll be good and sorry!<br> I'm not scared of ya anymore,<br> Harry. That's another thing.<br> Oh, you're not, huh?<br> Hit somethin' else. I'm leavin'.<br> - What?<br> - For good.<br> Let's get organized around here!<br> You just can't walk out, cutie!<br> You're in this too deep! I'm in the<br> middle of the biggest thing I ever done!<br> Maybe I was wrong hookin'<br> ya in, but you're in!<br> - I'm not gonna be, I decided.<br> - All right, fine!<br> - You wanna wash it up?<br> All right, we'll wash it up.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm too important to monkey<br> around with what you think!<br> Jim! Jim, wake up!<br> - Jim!<br> - What is it?<br> Come on! You got some work to do!<br> All right. Be right with you.<br> Okay, well, get a move on!<br> I'll fix it so you're<br> out of here in no time!<br> I spoiled ya! I was gonna<br> make ya real partners!<br> You don't want it? Fine! Let's<br> see how you do without me!<br> And you don't look like you looked<br> nine years ago. In fact, you look lousy.<br> If you want the truth, I'll<br> be glad to be rid of ya!<br> And as far as I'm concerned,<br> - Yeah?<br> - "vi-ce ver-sa."<br> Oh.<br> You're back.<br> - All set?<br> - Shut up!<br> What's the matter?<br> She's goin' off! We're gonna settle<br> things and get her out of here!<br> - You sure you know what you're doing?<br> - First time in my life I do.<br> - Where's that stuff you wanted her to sign?<br> - In your bedroom.<br> - Well, come on!<br> - No!<br> What do you mean, no?<br> I mean... Uh, take the<br> shortcut. The sooner, the better.<br> They're in the bottom drawer.<br> - Blue covers?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Three copies?<br> - That's right.<br> Paul took them.<br> - When?<br> - Just now.<br> - What for?<br> - What do you think for?<br> To get put in the<br> newspapers, I guess.<br> - Some kind of jokes I don't like.<br> - It's no joke.<br> Paul said it's the<br> biggest swindle since...<br> the tea pots, somethin' like that.<br> What are you gettin'<br> so white about?<br> You told me yourself it<br> was perfectly all right.<br> - Why, you double-crossin' little...<br> - I don't see it like that!<br> If there's a fire and I call the<br> engine, so who am I double-crossin'?<br> The fire?<br> We're in trouble, Harry.<br> If this stuff breaks,<br> - nobody will play with us.<br> - What's to do?<br> It might be best under the<br> circumstances to call it off.<br> - What?<br> - Let him publish. If nothing<br> happens, he looks silly.<br> I've been here two months! I've<br> spent I don't know how much dough.<br> I'm supposed to let all that ride?<br> - You don't want to play it safe?<br> - I want what I came after!<br> - It's gonna be tough.<br> - Because some little weasel gets noisy?<br> - I'll cut his tongue out! You're chicken!<br> - Yes think so?<br> - Yes, I think so.<br> - You're off the handle because...<br> it looks like I've been<br> right and you've been wrong!<br> Shut up! I'll handle this.<br> All right.<br> Lookin' for someone?<br> - Billie.<br> - Come on in.<br> - Billie!<br> - Gee, I'm tired. I was down...<br> - I think you've got somethin'<br> by mistake belongs to me.<br> - That so?<br> How 'bout it?<br> Hey.<br> Sit down.<br> - Hello.<br> - How you been?<br> - Fine. And you?<br> - Fine.<br> - Go around to his place and get the stuff.<br> - It's not there, Jim.<br> Where then?<br> You wanna play rough?<br> I know how to do that too.<br> Listen, you two heels. I make<br> business. I got too much at stake here.<br> You've got somethin'<br> that belongs to me.<br> If you want out of here<br> alive, you better give it back.<br> - I'm no blowhard! Tell him!<br> - He's no blowhard.<br> He's had people killed before.<br> - About six years ago, there was this guy...<br> - Shut up!<br> You ain't gonna be tellin'<br> nobody nothin' pretty soon.<br> - Double negative, right?<br> - Right.<br> You don't seem to be gettin' the<br> idea! You've never been in trouble...<br> - like you're gonna be unless<br> you do what I'm tellin' ya!<br> - Wait a minute, Harry.<br> There's another way to handle this. I<br> really think you've pulled a boner, friend.<br> - My advice to you is lay off.<br> - And mine is stop sticking<br> your noses in my business.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Talk about stickin' noses!<br> You're the biggest buttinsky...<br> - I ever run into!<br> - Told you once before, Harry, that's my job.<br> That's why your papers are in the<br> U.S. mails addressed to myself.<br> You're job? What?<br> Gettin' in my way?<br> - Well, not exactly.<br> - What then? I'd like to know?<br> To find out what goes on<br> and get it to the people.<br> - What people?<br> - The people.<br> - I never heard of 'em.<br> - You will, Harry, someday.<br> They're gettin' to be more and<br> more well-known all the time.<br> What if I told you this whole<br> operation is strictly according to law?<br> - Then I'd say the law needs revision.<br> - Who are you, the government?<br> - Of course.<br> - Since when?<br> - Since 1779, right?<br> - Right.<br> What do you think you've got, Paul?<br> A connection between Harry's combine<br> and the congressman's amendment.<br> All right. But why single us<br> out to make a fuss over it?<br> - Yeah, why?<br> - What we're doing isn't uncommon.<br> - It's done every day.<br> - Done every day, that's right.<br> For all I know, there's an<br> undiscovered murder committed every day.<br> And what does that prove?<br> All this undercover pressure.<br> This bribery, corruption,<br> government between friends.<br> Sure, it goes on all the<br> time, and it's tough to crack!<br> Just ask me. I've tried for years.<br> You need more than<br> knowing about it.<br> You gotta have facts and figures,<br> and most important, the names.<br> And he's got 'em.<br> All right, let's get down to it.<br> What'll you take, Paul?<br> - I'll take a drink, please, if I may.<br> - Don't get fancy!<br> - I ain't met a guy yet didn't have his price!<br> - I have.<br> - I'm talkin' about big numbers!<br> - You and your big numbers!<br> You don't watch out, you'll be<br> wearin' one across your chest!<br> I'll get to you later!<br> Now make up your mind. There's<br> two ways we can do business.<br> One, you play ball, and I'll<br> make it worth your while.<br> Two, start watchin' your step, 'cause<br> there's no place you can walk...<br> no place you can live<br> if you monkey wrench me.<br> Now, what do you say?<br> - I'd like to think it over.<br> - All right, you got two minutes.<br> Come on, Billie.<br> - Wait a minute, Harry!<br> - Harry!<br> Cut it out, Harry!<br> Cut it out, Harry!<br> - Operator! Let me go! Operator!<br> - Get a hold of yourself!<br> You stupid fool! What<br> do you think you are?<br> Can't you see that all this muscle<br> stuff is a thing of the past?<br> You cut it out, or you'll<br> be a thing of the past too!<br> - I got mad.<br> - Who are you to get mad, you big baboon?<br> You ought to be grateful you're<br> allowed to walk around free.<br> You don't know me good<br> enough for that kind of talk.<br> I know ya. A kick in the keister, a crooked<br> play, and your problems are all solved.<br> Bigger problems, bigger<br> kicks. Who's next?<br> - The government? The nation?<br> - Aw, don't blow your top.<br> I'm still ready to do business.<br> How's a hundred grand?<br> A hundred grand is beautiful.<br> - But I can't take it.<br> - Why not?<br> - My girl wouldn't like it, would she?<br> - She certainly wouldn't.<br> - All right, then! What's your idea?<br> - Nothing. No idea.<br> I'm just trying to show you that...<br> legislation's not meant for buying and selling.<br> This country, with<br> its institutions,<br> - belongs to the people who inhibit it!<br> - Inhabit!<br> - Inhabit it!<br> - I always did what I want. I'm always gonna.<br> - Try it.<br> - Who's gonna stop me?<br> - Us two.<br> - Youse two!<br> Oh, don't make me split a gut.<br> It's gonna be some fine day when a<br> What are you standin' around like a<br> thief and dummy? What do I pay you for?<br> - Say somethin'!<br> - All right, I'll say something.<br> - Well?<br> - They're right.<br> Whose side are you on?<br> - What do you want?<br> - Rye, ginger ale.<br> Who asked you? Butt out!<br> Tell that congressman of yours<br> he's all washed up. I guarantee it.<br> As far as you're concerned, you're<br> not gonna get away with it either.<br> - Don't worry about me.<br> - Oh, but I do.<br> I worry like the devil.<br> I stay up nights.<br> You know, when you live in Washington,<br> it's enough to break your heart.<br> You see a perfect piece of<br> machinery... the democratic structure...<br> and somebody's always tampering with<br> it, trying to make it hit the jackpot.<br> When you steal from the government,<br> you're stealin' from yourself, ya dumb ox!<br> - You two, go ahead. I'm goin' right ahead.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - I'll tell you where you're goin'.<br> - You?<br> Sure. In this whole thing, I guess you<br> forgot about me... about how I'm a partner.<br> Jim once told me... 126<br> different yards I own.<br> - Control.<br> - Same thing.<br> So here's how it's gonna be.<br> I don't want 'em.<br> I don't want anything of yours or to do<br> with you, so I'm gonna sign 'em all back.<br> - All right.<br> - Only not all at once.<br> Just one at a time. One a year.<br> Only you gotta behave,<br> 'cause if you don't...<br> I could let go on everything.<br> For what you've done, even<br> since I've known you...<br> I bet you could be put in<br> jail for about 900 years.<br> You'd be a pretty old<br> man when you got out.<br> - What's goin' on around here?<br> - A revolution.<br> Come on, Paul. I'll<br> send for my things.<br> You little crumb! You'll<br> be sorry for this day.<br> Just wait and see. Go ahead and go<br> with him, but you don't stand a chance.<br> If I've ever seen anybody<br> outsmart themselves, it's you.<br> - Good-bye, all.<br> - And you!<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah! You're fired.<br> Sorry, Harry.<br> I enjoyed working for you.<br> Open up.<br> - All right, Harry?<br> - Do what I'm tellin' you!<br> How do you like that?<br> He could've had 100 grand.<br> She could've had me.<br> - Both wind up with nothin'.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Dumb chump.<br> Crazy broad.<br> To all the dumb chumps<br> and all the crazy broads...<br> past, present and future...<br> who thirst for knowledge<br> and search for truth;<br> who fight for justice<br> and civilize each other...<br> and make it so tough<br> for crooks like you...<br> and me.<br> License, please.<br> - No, not this license.<br> - Oh, sorry.<br> Okay, forget it. My wedding<br> present. But take it easy...<br> - or you'll never make it. Oh, don't worry.<br> - We'll make it.<br> It's a clear case<br> of predestination.<br> - "Pre"... what?<br> - Look it up.<br>
