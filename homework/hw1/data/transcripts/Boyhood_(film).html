Is not it good?<br> The head spins. Look at the bracelet.<br> Made by Indians in Alaska.<br> Dad gave me this bear<br> carved by hand and this tiki.<br> It is a totem.<br> And guess! We played bowling<br> and had four perfect shots!<br> And we could ride in Dad's car.<br> - Hey, Liv.<br> - Hi.<br> I know you wanted<br> let them hear about your mother.<br> I thought it would be easier here.<br> You ruined my plans.<br> - We wanted to show the rooms.<br> - Yes.<br> Did you eat anything?<br> Ate fries<br> at the bowling alley.<br> - Did you do your homework?<br> - No. - Not yet.<br> Can I talk to you outside for a second?<br> Yes, of course.<br> They ate more fries.<br> Do you think he will stay for the night?<br> Apparently not.<br> An unconditioned stimulus,<br> something that produces ...<br> unlearned response,<br> involuntary and not conditioned.<br> What was the stimulus used<br> by Pavlov in his experiment?<br> Come on!

Or rather, meat powder.<br> Whatever it was dust<br> meat, it worked with your dog.<br> He placed the meat powder and produced<br> unconditioned response ...<br> the dog was salivating ...!<br> OK?<br> Who can give me another example of a<br> unconditioned response to the stimulus ...<br> happens every day.<br> Perhaps it is occurring<br> any of you now.<br> What about sex?<br> Come to an attractive member<br> the opposite sex and have a ...<br> automatic response.<br> Not even have to think about it.<br> Mick Jagger wrote a song:<br> "Oh, when you named salivate<br> like a Pavlov dog.

I'm sorry.<br> I think it will make the house for sale.<br> Why?<br> It's very big for us.<br> Soon you're going to college.<br> It is very expensive. Basta.<br> What you bought?<br> Because I love taking<br> bad decisions in my life.<br> And have you on the edge of poverty.<br> I spent half<br> of my life buying crap ...<br> and now I will go the other<br> quitndomelas half off.<br> Yeah? Like what?<br> I shook off two spouses.<br> Now it's up to the<br> mortgage, maintenance,<br> Trinkets, insurance ...<br> owners, property taxes,<br> pipes ..<br> Do you know?

I do what I can.<br> Well, we're in trouble.<br> What do you tell clients?<br> "Sorry about the dirty dishes,<br> but Mason does what he can. "<br> "That's what he told me."<br> "After flirting with April<br> and eat shrimp that had been ".<br> I know that today is difficult.<br> But I want to tell you something.<br> I have scheduled you<br> Waiters this summer.<br> It's a lot more responsibility.<br> And more money.<br> What do you think?<br> All right.<br> I know you can with the money, but<br> you can handle the responsibility?<br> I think so. Because I believe in you.<br> I need you in the lounge.<br> Leave the dishes and hurry.<br> Come on. Do not disappoint me!<br> Does it work well?<br> Is the alternator does not give more trouble?<br> All right. Ready for the trip.<br> Are you going to see your sister in Austin?<br> Yeah, he said I could stay<br> in his uni dorm.<br> I think your partner is<br> travel, so no problem.<br> Already you applied for UT?<br> Would you have sent the form?<br> Not yet, but Sheena<br> is practically accepted.<br> If that's where you want to go ...<br> You should postularte<br> for early acceptance.<br> Let them know you're<br> a man who knows what he wants.<br> Some firmness<br> achieved much in this life.<br> - No?<br> - Yes.<br> And work? How's it going?<br> All right. Today was<br> a bad day. He missed a guy.<br> But no doubt it gives<br> another perspective on life.<br> People are pig!<br> When they ask you,<br> say "A Mason is doing very well."<br> "You have a job. Cleans everything."<br> Say hello to Annie and Cooper.<br> Say hello to your big brother.<br> "Hello, brother."<br> Hi Annie.

I have work.<br> - Call me when you get there.<br> - I will do it.<br> Have fun!<br> Sounds to me like a vision<br> all very simplistic.<br> Not at all. Finally I got it.<br> When they realized<br> it would be too expensive ...<br> build cyborgs and robots,<br> or whether the costs were<br> soaring, they decided that humans ...<br> self transformed into robots.<br> - That's what's happening.<br> - Right now?<br> Why not? There are billions of<br> ours out there, doing nothing.<br> We have cost.<br> And until we self-maintenance,<br> and we reproduce constantly.<br> And as we can see, we're ...<br> biologically programmed<br> to become cyborgs.<br> - As?<br> - Seriously.<br> I read an article the other day saying ...<br> when we heard the sound<br> the inbox<br> received an injection<br> dopamine in our brains.<br> As if we rewarded chemically<br> for letting it get brainwashed.<br> Is it not evil? We're screwed!<br> You think to delete your<br> Facebook page will change anything?<br> I remember when it did Traver<br> last year. And everyone laughed at him.<br> You laughed more than anyone.<br> I keep laughing at Traver.<br> Your need for attention was pathetic.<br> Or to be different, or something.<br> And it ended with that silly story<br> about it in the school newspaper.<br> And I had to make a great<br> ad when he returned the following month.<br> But I do not care.<br> I want to try to live<br> my life without a screen.<br> I want a real interaction.<br> A real person.<br> No profile posted online.<br> Apology. What were you saying?<br> It's okay.<br> I know you're joking, but ...<br> there is some truth.
