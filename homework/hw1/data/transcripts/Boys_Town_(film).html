                        Well, my lad,|they tell me you want to confess.<br> Yeah.<br> That will help the jury.<br> They convicted you on circumstantial|evidence. Understand?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Public opinion. Clear that up, too.<br> Justice itself will feel easier.<br> I'm doing it because I'm scared.<br> It may help the big rap|when I go through that last door.<br> You might as well do a real job.<br> I have a couple of newspapermen here,|and the judge who sentenced you...<br> Shut that up, will you?|Can't you stop that singing?<br> Now, now. It's his turn next.<br> You confess, he sings.<br> Okay.<br> - Bring on your gang.|- Good.<br> - Can I do anything for you, Dan?|- Yeah, how about a drink?<br> Okay.<br> Thanks.<br> - Do you want to see Father Flanagan?|- Sure.<br> I asked for him. He knew me when.<br> How much time have I got?<br> Eternity begins in 45 minutes, Dan.<br> What happens when that door|slams shut behind you?<br> - A bad minute or two.|- Yeah, I know. After that?<br> Dan, that's been a mystery|for a million years.<br> You can't expect to crack that|in a few seconds.<br> - Would you be afraid to die?|- No.<br> Why not, if you don't know what happens?<br> Well, I've made mistakes, Dan,|but I've always been sorry for them.<br> I try to make up for them.<br> If you killed a rat,|and it was coming to him...<br> could you find some way|to be sorry for that?<br> Dan, life and death should be left|to the Creator of life and death.<br> Please stay, will you?<br> How are you, Judge?<br> This is Lane Wellington. His column fought|for you. Didrt think you were guilty.<br> Sorry to let you down, pal.<br> If you'd stuck to your guns,|I'd have kept you alive for years.<br> I wouldn't try to be funny, if I were you.<br> This man wants to admit|his debt to the State.<br> What's that? My debt to the State?<br> If you'd have done this sooner,|the debt wouldn't be so big.<br> Is that what this is all about?<br> You're going to take my life,|because I owe the State something?<br> When I was a kid, 12 years old,|my mother died.<br> Did I go on the cuff to the State|for the gutters I slept in? Is that it?<br> That's just sniveling. The State reached|its arms out for three years...<br> Yeah, in the reformatory.<br> When I went in,|copping a loaf of bread was a job.<br> - When I come out, I could rob a bank!|- Holy cats!<br> Get this, big shots.|I'm going out that way in a few minutes.<br> So you're getting the lowdown.<br> Where was the State when a lonely,|starving kid cried himself to sleep...<br> in a flophouse with a bunch of drunks,|tramps, and hoboes?<br> Is that when this debt started?<br> The only pals I had a chance at|were the kids in the alley.<br> I had to be tough to string along.<br> Just before we got out|of the State's arms...<br> the reformatory, we made up a gang,|six of us, and pals.<br> We bet our lives across the board,|and let them ride. Crooks!<br> Sure! Your mouths pop open at that one.<br> Greek to you wise guys, ain't it?<br> One of them turned rat for State's|evidence, and I killed him. But get this.<br> One friend when I'm 12 years old...<br> and I don't stand here like this!|Now, go on, get out of here...<br> you bunch of mush-brained saps! Get out!<br> Listen, Father. I am sorry for my mistakes.<br> I am sorry.<br> Starving kid. Never had a chance.<br> Reformatory.<br> Break your mugs.<br> Steal our food, will you?|Get in your own streets, you mugs!<br> Here. Tommy, stop it.<br> Come on, Tommy. Stop it.<br> Tommy, stop it!<br> Skinny!<br> Loafers! Police!<br> - Good morning, Dave.|- Good morning.<br> - Look, $80 smashed.|- It's a shame, Dave.<br> Father Eddie, that place of yours|draws the rats around.<br> - It's like molasses and flies.|- I suppose it does.<br> I sleep beside a machine gun,|while you rock-a-bye-baby the 40 thieves.<br> Read all about it!<br> Dan Farrow electrocuted!|Read all about it!<br> Where's His Reverend?|Don't we get a sermon this morning?<br> Hear ye, my friends.<br> Scoff your coffee while ye may,|turn up your toes...<br> call it a day.<br> I didn't start this place|to give you men a laugh. I really didn't.<br> I thought I could help you.<br> - Sorry, Father Flanagan.|- We apologize.<br> Thanks for the coffee.<br> We all love you, dominie, every one of us.<br> Well, you can pass the word|along the road...<br> that somebody else will be running|the place pretty shortly. I'm leaving.<br> - But, Father...|- Weasel, you're too smart.<br> No, I had decided before.<br> I spent last night, or rather this morning,|with Dan Farrow just before he...<br> It was too late to do very much for him...<br> and I guess it's too late|to do very much for you.<br> I'm afraid you're satisfied with something|to eat and a place to sleep.<br> Father Flanagan!<br> - What is it, Skinny?|- They got Jimmy!<br> The cops got Jimmy!|Please tell them to let him go.<br> He's my brother.<br> - Who else have they got?|- They got Tommy and they got Steve.<br> And they told me to go home.<br> Yeah, home.<br> Where's your mother, Skinny?<br> Come on. We'll see what we can do.<br> Mr. Morris, do you know|who broke your window?<br> - Yes, Your Honor.|- Pardon me, but does it really matter?<br> It was a free-for-all.|Any one of them could have done it.<br> What do you mean, Father?<br> Not to obstruct justice, even if I could,|but one boy threw that stone...<br> did this special damage.|But he didn't mean to do it.<br> They were all throwing things.|They were all excited.<br> I'm trying to reduce it to a definite charge.<br> That's what I was afraid of, Your Honor.<br> - None of us want to abuse children.|- But we do, nevertheless.<br> The business of the court is to take care|of the honest citizen.<br> You. I have a high regard for you, but...<br> Your Honor, these boys were arrested|this morning.<br> It's now... It's 3:30.<br> Has anybody come forward|to say one good word for them?<br> Father, mother, uncle, sister. Anybody?<br> Well, you're saying quite a few.<br> And I'll go on, until you take back|the privilege you granted me.<br> You heard Mr. Calatieri.<br> - May I question him?|- Certainly.<br> - Sit down, Mr. Morris.|- Thank you.<br> Mr. Calatieri.<br> Yes, Father?<br> Tommy, stand up.<br> - Tommy came in to buy some salami.|- Yes.<br> I wrap my salami. I put him down.|He say, "Half a dozen eggs."<br> I turn around to get the eggs,|I come back, where is my salami?<br> No salami and no Tommy.<br> But you didn't really see Tommy|steal the salami, did you?<br> My nice, fresh salami. She no walk away.<br> And the police found the salami,|and some bread, some other things.<br> There's no doubt about their being stolen.<br> There's also no doubt that these boys|should be taken off the streets...<br> - for their own good.|- And sent to the reformatory.<br> I'm wondering if you want to do that|to a homeless boy...<br> - just on circumstantial evidence.|- Well, what do you want me to do?<br> There's the salami,|and there's Mr. Calatieri.<br> They can have my salami.|I give it to them, free for present.<br> But next time, please, not the imported.<br> - There won't be any next time.|- You should have studied law, Father.<br> Thank you, Your Honor.|Well, I guess that's...<br> Unless my good friend wants to identify|the boy who threw the rock.<br> My window was smashed.|$80 gone to someplace...<br> But I...<br> Well, I can't say who did it, positively.<br> Father Flanagan, what's in your mind?<br> I'll assume full responsibility for these|boys if you'll place them in my charge.<br> I'll give them a home,|I'll see to their schooling...<br> and I'll guarantee their good conduct.<br> Well, I think you're letting yourself in|for a lot of trouble, but I'll give it a chance.<br> I release these boys into your custody.<br> - Thank you, Your Honor.|- And good luck to you.<br> Thank you. Come on, boys.<br> You're one of the finest fellows in town.<br> Why in the name of all that's holy|don't you want to meet nice people?<br> - Well, Dave, I know you.|- You...<br> - Father, do you want this?|- What is it, son?<br> It's a puzzle. You have to jiggle it around|till you get the eyes in the sockets.<br> Isn't that wonderful.<br> Thank you very much, Skinny.|I'll have a lot of fun with this.<br> Dave. Come on, boys.<br> Could you take the boys to your place|and keep them there a little while?<br> Sure. What?<br> I've got an important call to make.<br> All right, gentlemen, get in.<br> Oh, boy. A car ride.<br> Tommy, you better sit up here|in the front seat.<br> On second thought, you better all sit up|in the front seat. I feel safer.<br> Hold on, boys. Be careful.<br> - Dave, I'll see you a little later.|- Could you make it a little sooner?<br> Do you want me to drive, Mr. Morris?<br> I gave you permission three years ago|for your refuge.<br> You thought you could do a lot of good.<br> Well, I have the right to a mistake or two,|haven't I, Bishop?<br> And now you want to do something|I think is harder to do...<br> - certainly more unorthodox.|- That's true.<br> So I'm going to assign you to a parish.<br> That's good work, and you're a good man.<br> - Don't make the decision yet, please.|- Why not?<br> Why, you'd dream the best part|of your life away, if I'd let you.<br> But I'm not dreaming.<br> There's one thing I know, I really know.<br> And that is, that there's no such thing|in the world as a bad boy. I'm sure of that.<br> Do you realize the fight|you want to take on?<br> I know that a mother can take a whip|to the toughest boy in the world...<br> and he forgets it,|because he knows that she loves him.<br> I know the fight, and I haven't anything|to do it with, except faith.<br> But...<br> with your kind permission,|I would rather have it than the parish.<br> I can't help you.<br> We have no arrangement|for outside things like this.<br> But you have my permission.<br> How are you beginning?<br> First, I must rent a house.<br> No doubt, fumigate and launder it.<br> Bishop, I shall never forget this.<br> My blessing.<br> Hello. I thought you got lost.<br> No. I had a little chat with my bishop.<br> I rented a house.<br> - You're renting houses now?|- Yes.<br> Of course, I have to pay something down,|so I need a little money.<br> - A little money? Yeah.|- $100.<br> $100?<br> What security have you got?<br> Well, let's see here.<br> - You want $100 for this?|- Yes.<br> Look...<br> you can have any one of those|for 65 cents.<br> And any one of them is better than yours.<br> And you want $100.<br> I need the money very badly.<br> With merchandise like that,|I need it worse than you do.<br> Got anything else?<br> Wait a minute.<br> - That's a 10-cent toy.|- Yeah, you can have a lot of fun with it.<br> Not a $100 won'th, I can't.<br> Have you got any other security?<br> Every boy who becomes a good American|citizen is won'th $10,000 to the State.<br> That's a fact. I have good authority for it.<br> I'm sorry,|but $100 for a bum watch like this...<br> and a hunk of tin|with a couple of ball bearings...<br> All right, Dave.|I don't blame you for turning me down.<br> Thanks just the same.|I'll try someplace else.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Couldrt you make a good American|for $50?<br> All right, there's your $100.<br> No. You keep the watch.<br> I'll keep this.<br> - I'll redeem that some day with interest.|- Yeah.<br> Here, sign this.<br> - No, don't sign it.|- Thanks.<br> Now, you'd better leave|before I change my mind.<br> I'm not afraid of that, Dave.<br> Now, I wonder if you could show me|some furniture.<br> You know, chairs and tables,|and stuff like that.<br> $100 won'th?<br> I got a little list here that I made out.<br> There.<br> All right.<br> I suppose when your boys grow up,|they'll break bigger and better windows.<br> I'll be right with you, boys.<br> Certainly on their good behavior,|aren't they?<br> Ten chairs.<br> There's two.<br> - What does the whole thing come to?|- $220.<br> I'll give you $150 for the lot.<br> It's a deal, for $200.<br> Right. $160. Not a cent more.<br> Why, it cost me almost that much.<br> - Make it $190.|- No.<br> Say, wait a minute. What am I doing?<br> I'm bargaining with my own money.|I'm losing two ways on the deal.<br> Here's $50 down payment.<br> You're offering me $50 of my own money...<br> as down payment|on my own furniture. No!<br> Oh, well. All right.<br> What's the use of my taking the $50?<br> You'd only come around for it|again tomorrow.<br> Here's the address.<br> You mind if I throw you out?<br> Look, tonight, just before you go to sleep,|you're going to like yourself a lot.<br> I'll send the furniture over.<br> Then I'm going to a doctor|and get my head examined.<br> Come on, boys. We're going home.<br> - Father Flanagan?|- Yes.<br> I'm from the "Morning Herald."<br> My editor, Mr. Hargraves, sent me over|to see what you're doing, and...<br> Well, right now, we're putting up|a little sign that Tommy made.<br> - We thought we might get some pictures.|- Some pictures?<br> Hey, fellows, come on.|We're going to get our pictures took.<br> Bring Father Flanagars coat.<br> - All right, sure!|- Oh, boy!<br> - Hotdog!|- Take it easy, please.<br> Here.<br> Let's get rid of the rock.|Here, hold the rock. Hold it, don't throw it.<br> Come right in here close. That's right.<br> - Put the rock behind your back.|- Big smile now.<br> - Okay, Jimmy?|- Okay.<br> - All right, hold it.|- Big smile.<br> Still.<br> Here he comes!<br> Hey, wait a minute, fellows.|You know what we planned.<br> Come on, get in your places.|Come on, we gotta sing. Come on.<br> Get in line.<br> Now, altogether...<br> Silent night!<br> Holy night!<br> All is calm<br> all is bright<br> Round yon Virgin<br> Mother and Child<br> Holy Infant<br> so tender and mild<br> Sleep in heavenly peace<br> Sleep in heavenly peace<br> Silent night!<br> Holy night!<br> That was a very nice reception, boys.|Thank you very much.<br> Tommy, would you take that out|in the kitchen?<br> What is it?<br> It's good food.|And there's enough there for all of us, too.<br> - What is it?|- What's in it?<br> It's good cornmeal mush,|not a tummy ache in a carload.<br> What else you got in the bag?<br> Well, I don't know, exactly.<br> I kind of picked these things up|hither and yon.<br> Once I got a sleigh.<br> Shut up.<br> I thought you said if we were good,|everybody would help us.<br> Well, I did say that, Skinny. I... But...<br> Well, maybe it'll take another Christmas|to make friends for us.<br> Gosh, if we was in a reform school,|it ain't mush for Christmas.<br> Tommy, are we going to forget|what we're trying to do?<br> Gee, if I was home,|my old man might wallop me...<br> but we'd have turkey at Christmas.<br> Well, Christmas has other meanings,|hasn't it, Bob?<br> Listen, I can get a turkey easy.|It's a cinch. Everybody's busy.<br> Bob!<br> You should get down on your knees|and ask pardon...<br> for a thought like that on Christmas Eve.<br> Jingle all the way<br> Mr. Morris!<br> - Merry Christmas, Tommy!|- Merry Christmas, Mr. Morris!<br> Merry Christmas!|Merry Christmas, everybody!<br> - Turkey and presents for everybody.|- Merry Christmas.<br> Am I late?<br> If ever in the world a man was on time.<br> Now, everybody sing.<br> Jingle all the way<br> In a one horse open sleigh<br> - Thank you, Father.|- Hello, Dave.<br> Hello, I came over as soon as I could.<br> What's up?<br> Now, let's get out of here, Dave.|It's pretty noisy.<br> Several new boys came in last week.|We're suffocating here.<br> Now, look, Eddie, just what do you want?<br> Dave, it's grand to see you.<br> You certainly have had a wonderful year,|haven't you?<br> It's been a wonderful year for both of us.<br> - Did you pay all your bills last month?|- Yes, sure. Most of them.<br> Skinny, what did I tell you|about biting your nails?<br> A few little odds and ends,|but I'll get the money for that.<br> That's what I was afraid of.<br> No, Dave,|that isn't why I wanted to see you.<br> No, I want you to take me for a little drive.|I want to show you something.<br> I'm a busy man.<br> That's just it, Dave.|Now, you've been working too hard...<br> with the new store and everything.|A little drive in the country will relax you.<br> Just what you need.|Just what we both need.<br> - Bye, Father Flanagan.|- Goodbye, boys.<br> Now remember what I told you.<br> Lovely country, isn't it?<br> Over 200 acres here of rich, fine soil.<br> You could really live and breathe out here.<br> - What about it?|- I want to buy it.<br> Now, look, Dave, I can get it cheap.|Just look at it, Dave.<br> We could build a real town|for the boys here.<br> They could have gardens, dormitories,|gymnasiums, classrooms...<br> Mortgages, and bills, and debts!|Be reasonable.<br> First you started with five boys,|then it was 20, then it was 50.<br> With this place,|you'd be looking for 100 boys.<br> - 500.|- All right, 500. What?<br> How you going to get the money?|How you going to do it? It's crazy.<br> Well, maybe you're right.<br> - What did you say?|- Maybe you're right.<br> Eddie, don't you feel well?<br> Maybe it's just a dream|that I'll never see fulfilled.<br> It seems a shame though,|a lot of boys cheated out of the chance...<br> to live a nice, decent life out in the open,|where they belong.<br> Stop it.<br> - How many acres?|- Over 200.<br> But you can't handle|as big a thing as this...<br> without a lot of public support,|contributions.<br> I haven't been a bad risk so far, have I?<br> No, you've paid back everything.|How, I don't know. It isn't that.<br> But this time you're biting off|more than you can chew.<br> The newspapers aren't friendly to you,|as it is.<br> - What do you think they'll say about this?|- I know.<br> - What do you suggest?|- Hargraves.<br> He owns the most powerful string|of newspapers in the Middle West.<br> And he's a tough nut to crack.<br> You get Hargraves behind you,|and maybe I can handle it.<br> That's fair, Dave.<br> All right, here you are.

And three fine mortgages|might make a grand finish.<br> - We've had mortgages before.|- Yes, little ones.<br> Look at the sweating you've done|to raise nickels, dimes, quarters...<br> penny contributions.<br> Now you've got to get dollars,|hundreds, thousands.<br> Wait a minute, Dave, wait a minute.|This doesn't have to be paid today.<br> - No, but the day will come.|- Dave.<br> Now, Eddie, I know.|I know you've always been in debt.<br> Debts up to your knees.|This time it's up to here.<br> It might not be as bad as that.<br> You've got to stop thinking from here,|and think from here a little bit.<br> Now, Eddie, come on.|Let's look at the figures, averages...<br> and see what we can set aside.<br> Father, we'll have to go now|if you're going to make that train.<br> My goodness, I forgot all about it.|I'll be right with you, Paul.<br> Now where are you going?<br> A boy in the State Penitentiary|wants to see me. He's in for life.<br> Yes, and you're in for life, too.<br> Thank you.<br> - Goodbye, Mo.|- Goodbye, Father.<br> - Have a nice trip, Father.|- Thank you.<br> - Goodbye, boys.|- Bye, Father.<br> Pee Wee.<br> Are you going to be a good boy|while I'm away?<br> Can I get my candy when you're away?<br> Freddie, everyday Pee Wee gets|a piece of candy in my office...<br> if he's a good boy.<br> Of course, if he isn't a good boy,|then he won't expect it.<br> Because Pee Wee is an honorable man,|aren't you, Pee Wee?<br> - Goodbye, boys.|- Bye, Father.<br> - Nice trip.|- Bye, Father.<br> - Father Flanagan.|- Warden.<br> This is Joe Marsh.|He leaves for a federal prison today.<br> - Hello, Joe.|- Hi.<br> - I'm letting you use my office, Father.|- I appreciate that.<br> The guard will let you know|when the time is up.<br> - Would you like them to stay?|- No, I don't think that's necessary.<br> See you later.<br> I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner,|but I was up to my ears in work...<br> when your letter came.<br> Yeah. Nursemaid for a couple of hundred|kids ain't no cinch.<br> That's right, no cinch.<br> Look, I didn't want to see you|for none of them phony prayers.<br> Nothing like that.|I got something else on my mind.<br> All right, go ahead, shoot.<br> Get this, I ain't sorry for nothing.<br> Well, everybody has a right|to look at things in their own way.<br> You bet. I went my own way,|and I got to be headman, didn't I?<br> Guys took off their hats|when I told them to...<br> and there's plenty of them still scared|that maybe I might bust out of this joint.<br> Well, now, look, you didn't have me come|all the way from Boys Town...<br> just to lord it over me, did you?<br> What's on your mind?<br> I got a kid brother, Whitey.<br> I've been taking care of him|ever since my old lady died.<br> Well, he's batty about me.|You know, thinks I'm aces.<br> Wants to be number one, like me.<br> But he ain't got what it takes.<br> He'd turn out to be a five-and-ten mug.|That's where you come in.<br> - You want me to take him to Boys Town.|- That's it.<br> The warders got $280 I had on me.|It's all yours.<br> He'll tell you where to find Whitey.|He's here in Lincoln.<br> Well, we're overcrowded,|but I guess I can find room for one more.<br> He's pretty tough.|You may have to kick him around.<br> I doubt that.<br> Sorry, time's up.<br> - Goodbye, Joe.|- So long.<br> Wait here, I'll be right down.<br> - Hello, son.|- Hello, Father.<br> - Ante two.|- Two?<br> You heard it.<br> Gee, I haven't had a hand yet.<br> I'm sitting in a rummy seat|myself over here.<br> Keep your hands to yourself, Shorty.<br> See who it is.<br> - What's it won'th?|- Two.<br> That's all it's won'th.<br> - Hello, Father.|- Hello, boys.<br> Hello, sir.<br> Hi, Doc.<br> Which one of you is Whitey Marsh?<br> I've got a message for Whitey.|I'd like to deliver it to him alone.<br> Hey, wait a minute.

They got to take it.<br> Forget yourself, for the good of the school.|Tell your friends to vote for me.<br> That's the big deal.

They're making good,|every one of them.<br> That's serving my Creator and my country.<br> In 30 days, Father Flanagan, they'll be|obliged to take this place away from you...<br> unless you change your mind.<br> No use, Burton.|He'll do what he thinks is right...<br> if the heavens fall down.<br> You know figures are the most...<br> Later on, youngster.<br> Pee Wee.<br> This is Boys Town.<br> All right, Pee Wee, go.<br> You're as cold as Greenland.<br> Getting colder.<br> Now you're getting warm, Pee Wee.<br> You're burning up, Pee Wee.|You're red hot.<br> There you are.<br> Hey, Pee Wee...<br> did you brush your teeth?<br> I lost my toothbrush.<br> You lost your... When, Pee Wee?<br> A couple of days.<br> A...<br> Paul, come in here.<br> A couple of...|Pee Wee, I'm sorry about that.<br> Now that's my fault.<br> Paul, how in the world|could we let Pee Wee go...<br> for two whole days without a toothbrush?<br> Pee Wee, you've got to have|some more candy to make up for that.<br> Paul, I want you to go right down...<br> to the storeroom,|and get him a brand new toothbrush.<br> And you ask the Commissioner|of his dormitory how a thing like that...<br> could ever happen, 'cause he's a good boy,|and we've been neglecting him.<br> He wouldn't think of coming in here|for candy if he hadrt been a good boy.<br> Take care of that right away, Paul,|and make a big fuss about it. It's a shame.<br> I'm awfully sorry this happened.|I'll get to the bottom of it.<br> Maybe I can find my toothbrush.<br> You mean, maybe someplace|you haven't looked?<br> Yes, Father. It might be there.<br> Pee Wee.<br> You know, Pee Wee, when you don't|look at me straight in the eyes...<br> I think maybe you don't like me.<br> - You said 30 days, Mr. Burton?|- Right.<br> The only solution you have to offer|is to turn away the boys who cannot pay...<br> and take in the boys who can.<br> Every man on your Board of Directors|feels the same way.<br> I'm afraid we'll have to think|of something else...<br> because that cannot be done.<br> Will you leave me alone with the problem?<br> What are you going to do about it?<br> Something I do very privately,|say a prayer.<br> We've been through some|pretty tough spots together, haven't we?<br> I can't send boys away, not any of them.<br> Eddie, if you can pray your way out of this,|I'll join the school.<br> And another thing...<br> I'm not going to say anything personal|about one of the candidates.<br> I'll say that only to him.<br> Don't forget, a lot of us were pretty|rough stuff when we came here, too.<br> But he's run a campaign|rotten with lies and mud...<br> and promises that he knew were lies|when he made them!<br> I'm finished, Father.<br> Boys, I'm sorry I'm late.<br> Now, as usual, I take no side.<br> The election is your business.<br> All right, Whitey, it's your turn.<br> - Friends of Boys Town.|- Take off your hat!<br> Excuse me, Father.<br> Well, fellows, here we go.|Tomorrow's the big day.<br> I'm not much for making long speeches,|but it looks to me...<br> like you've been singing the same old tune|around here all the time.<br> But believe me...<br> if you vote right tomorrow,|we'll be swinging that old tune.<br> Yes, sir, fellows, we'll be swinging it.<br> And may the best man win.<br> And now, boys, we'll hear|from our other candidate, Tony Ponessa.<br> I've been in Boys Town about five years.<br> I've always hoped|I might be Mayor sometime.<br> But there's something I want|more than that.<br> Boys Town must always be|just what Father Flanagan made it.<br> Must have a purpose, high ideals.<br> Well, I'm not sure of myself...<br> but one of the candidates has proven|he's the right man.<br> So I retire from the race.<br> I ask my friends to support|Freddie Fuller for re-election.<br> Of all the double-crossing tricks.|And the day before election!<br> Go on, the rest of you.<br> Quiet, boys, quiet.<br> Now, we have various ways here...<br> of letting new boys find out|how things are done.<br> I hope some of you haven't forgotten|how long it took you.<br> Fellows. Now, listen to me.<br> Whitey and I have been battling for votes|for ourselves...<br> and Tony thought of nothing|but Boys Town.<br> If you want a standing vote right now,|Tony has it, hands down.<br> You mean "hands up," don't you?<br> If you want Tony for Mayor,|raise your right hands.<br> Well, boys, this is very unusual.<br> And a very great honor, Tony.<br> You tried to give it away,|and they gave it back to you.<br> Wait a minute.<br> We haven't heard|from the other candidate.<br> And I got plenty to say, too.<br> I think you and Tony|are a pair of dirty, double-crossing guys.<br> I told you any time I had the idea|I could take you apart, I'd let you know.<br> - Yeah?|- Well, I got the idea.<br> Any time's all right for me.|You know that, don't you?<br> Boys.<br> Well, it looks like this battle is inevitable.<br> All right, Whitey...<br> but all fights here are according to Hoyle,|and they're in the ring.<br> Okay!<br> Is that all clear, boys?<br> Now, you break when I tell you.<br> The rounds will be two minutes,|one-minute rest.<br> Half a round, and a good long rest for him.<br> Go to your corners.<br> Fight.<br> Attaboy, Whitey!<br> Come on, get up there.<br> One, two.<br> One, two...<br> three, four, five.<br> Whitey!<br> One, two, three.<br> All right, Whitey, you've had enough.<br> It's in the middle drawer, Pee Wee.<br> There's Whitey. Where's he going?<br> Whitey!<br> Wait for me, Whitey!<br> Whitey, wait for me. Whitey!<br> Hey, where you going?<br> Go on, beat it, will you?<br> - You going away?|- Sure, I'm blowing the plant.<br> Go on back, will you, Pee Wee?|Where you belong. That's a good kid.<br> On your way.<br> But you and me's pals, ain't we?<br> Go on and beat it, will you? Go ahead.<br> I'm your pal, Whitey.<br> Take me with you.<br> No. I can't be bothered.<br> Go on and beat it, will you?<br> No, I want to go with you!<br> Go on, beat it.<br> No, I want to go with you.<br> Go on back and scram, will you?<br> Pee Wee!<br> Speak to me. Pee Wee.<br> I didn't mean it. Honest, I didn't.<br> Speak to me, Pee Wee!<br> Oh, God. I'll do anything,|anything at all, Pee Wee.<br> I'll ride you piggyback. Go speak to me.<br> - I'll carry him, Father.|- No, I'll take him.<br> Pee Wee.<br> No one is allowed.<br> ...Christ, Our Lord. Amen.<br> Joe Marsh!<br> Joe, it's me, Whitey!<br> Come on, let's get outta here.<br> Yeah, come on.<br> Take the car. Wait at Bogg's Tavern.<br> - But how about you?|- You heard me. Get going.<br> I'll meet you later.<br> Sorry, kid. I didn't know it was you.<br> - Where'd he get you?|- Right here.<br> - Can you stand up?|- Yeah.<br> Come on. We gotta get outta here.<br> Let's go.<br> It's not bad. You'll be okay. Just lie still.<br> What are you doing out of school?<br> I walked out.<br> You walk back, get me?|You're going straight.<br> That's why I put you there.<br> Stay right here till I send for you.<br> - How'd you escape, Joe?|- Never mind that.<br> Listen, Whitey, no squawking or squealing.<br> No.<br> Don't talk until you're dead sure|I got away.<br> - All right, Joe.|- Keep that leg quiet.<br> Forget me, kid. My road's a lot too tough.<br> - So long.|- Joe, don't go.<br> Unless there's a concussion,|he'll be all right.<br> Take a little time, though.<br> Pee Wee, lad, I'll keep the candy on tap.<br> - You're wanted on the telephone, Father.|- Thank you, Sister.<br> - Hello?|- Father Flanagan...<br> Whitey's hurt.<br> - He's hurt?|- Yeah.<br> He's over in a church at 19th and Dodge.<br> Hello?<br> ...and I pray for Pee Wee.<br> It was all my fault, but I didn't mean it.|Honest, I didn't mean it.<br> Let him live.<br> Please make him get well.<br> Are you hurt badly, Whitey?<br> - Who told you?|- I don't know.<br> - Do you?|- I ain't talking.<br> - How's Pee Wee?|- He's all right. He'll pull through.<br> - Can you walk at all?|- Sure.<br> Here, put your arm over my shoulder.<br> Good evening, Father.<br> Boys, you should be in bed, shouldn't you?<br> - Whitey's up there, isn't he?|- Yes, he is.<br> There's trouble, and we know it.<br> Evening, Father.<br> Did one of your boys|come home wounded?<br> Yes, Whitey Marsh.<br> There was a bank robbery.|The night watchman was killed.<br> Robbery?<br> Well, what has that got to do|with Whitey?<br> I found this cap.<br> - And who are you?|- Reporter, "Morning Dispatch."<br> The boy's name is in it, Father...<br> and Boys Town.<br> I'm afraid there's something to it|this time.<br> - Where did you find this?|- In the alley near the bank.<br> There was a trail of blood to a church.|But we were a little late, he'd gone.<br> Yes, I got him.<br> - Where is he?|- In the infirmary.<br> Well, I'll have to take him in.<br> He's been wounded.|He shouldn't be moved.<br> - I can't help that.|- Sheriff, I'm the head of a community...<br> with complete autonomy|and a better record than any in the State.<br> I'll be responsible for Whitey|until he's able to be questioned.<br> Well, if the boy's hurt,|I'll take your word, of course.<br> But I'll have to leave a deputy.|Tim, you stand by.<br> I'll call later.<br> The wound is superficial, Father.|Nothing to worry about.<br> Leave us alone, please, Sister.<br> All right, Whitey, let's have it.<br> - What?|- The whole story.<br> - There ain't nothing to tell.|- Stop that.<br> They found your cap near the bank...<br> and they followed your trail to the church,|where I found you.<br> Why don't you leave me alone?<br> If I hadrt gotten there first,|you'd be in jail now.<br> Whitey, I don't believe you're guilty.<br> You might as well save your breath.|I ain't talking.<br> It was a bad day when I brought you here.<br> I've always said there was no such thing|in the world as a bad boy.<br> I've built my life on it.<br> You're the only boy in all these years|that hasn't had a heart somewhere...<br> that I could reach, somehow, sometime.<br> Whitey, over 200 boys have a home here,|but tomorrow night...<br> they won't have any home.|And that's up to you, Whitey.<br> Because I never worked as hard|with any boy in my life.

I got scared,|and I ran out to the alley...<br> and I got plugged.<br> Then somebody picked me up and took me|to the place where you found me.<br> - That's all I know.|- You're lying!<br> You know a lot more than that.<br> I just got through telling you all I know!<br> Who picked you up in the alleyway|and carried you?<br> You're shielding someone.<br> Are you going to see these boys|turned out into the streets, into alleys...<br> into reformatories, and worse?<br> Lose their home?<br> All right, Whitey, that licks me.<br> Yes, it was a sad, bad day|when I brought you here.<br> It was, indeed.<br> The Sheriff left a deputy to watch you.|I'll turn you over to the police tomorrow.<br> He doesn't feel like talking tonight.<br> Well, my friend,|you're sticking to the finish, huh?<br> Eddie, come on down and see Hargraves.|They're getting out extras, bad ones.<br> They've got the case tried...<br> and they've got you hung,|unless you can do something about it.<br> - Is this it?

That's all.<br> Excuse me.<br> Yes? Police Headquarters?<br> Your friend, Whitey Marsh, has escaped.<br> Two of the other boys went with him.<br> I believe you made yourself responsible|for him.<br> That means something like|"accessory after the fact."<br> Well, I'm afraid that's all.<br> Sorry, Father.
