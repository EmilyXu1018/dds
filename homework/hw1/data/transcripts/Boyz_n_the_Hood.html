My brothers<br> been shot and they still alive.<br> They lucky.<br> Y'all want to see something?<br> What?<br> I ain't saying what.<br> Want to see it or not?<br> Is that blood?<br> What happened?<br> Somebody got smoked. Look at<br> the hole in the wall, stupid.<br> Least I can tell my times tables.<br> Look! Why is the blood<br> turning yellow?<br> That's what happens when it<br> separates from the plasma.<br> So that's how the settlers<br> survived that long hard winter...<br> ...that took so many of their lives,<br> is by eating foods...<br> ...that were given to them,<br> like the turkey and the squash...<br> ...and all the foods that we think of<br> as our traditional holiday meal.<br> And that's why we celebrate<br> Thanksgiving...<br> ...to commemorate the unity<br> between the Indians...<br> ...excuse me...<br> ...the Native Americans...<br> ...and the early English settlers<br> who were called... Class?<br> Pilgrims.<br> That's right, the Pilgrims.<br> Very good.<br> The penguins!<br> Who said that?<br> - Mr. Styles.<br> - That's me.<br> How is it you always have<br> something funny to say?<br> Because I'm a comedian.<br> Would you like to come up<br> and teach the class?<br> Yeah, I can do that.<br> Very well, come on up.
