                        I shaII teII you of WiIIiam WaIIace,<br> Historians from EngIand wiII say I am a Iiar,<br> But history is written by those<br> who have hanged heroes,<br> The King of ScotIand had died without a son,<br> And the King of EngIand,<br> a crueI pagan known as<br> Edward the Longshanks,<br> cIaimed the throne of ScotIand for himself,<br> ScotIand`s nobIes fought him<br> and fought each other over the crown,<br> So Longshanks invited them<br> to taIks of a truce,<br> No weapons, One page onIy,<br> One farmer of that shire was MaIcoIm<br> WaIIace, a commoner with his own Iands,<br> He had two sons: John and WiIIiam,<br> I toId you to stay.<br> WeII, I finished my work.<br> Where are we going?<br> MacAndrews`. He was supposed<br> to visit after the gathering.<br> - Can I come?<br> - No. Go home, boy.<br> - But I want to go.<br> - Go home, or you`II feeI the back of my hand.<br> Away hame, WiIIiam.<br> MacAndrews.<br> HoIy Jesus.<br> WiIIiam.<br> It`s aII right, it`s aII right. Easy, Iad.<br> WiIIiam.<br> And I say we hit back now.<br> - We cannae fight them.<br> - Something`s got to be done.<br> WaIIace is right. We fight them.<br> Every nobIeman wiIIing to fight<br> was at that meeting.<br> We cannot beat an army.<br> Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.<br> We do not have to beat them...<br> Just fight them.<br> - Now, who`s with me?<br> - I am, WaIIace.<br> - AII right.<br> - Aye.<br> - Where do you think you`re going?<br> - With you.<br> Och, are ye? And what are you going to do?<br> - I`m gonna heIp.<br> - Aye, and a good heIp you`II be, too.<br> But I need you to stay here<br> and Iook after the pIace for me<br> whiIe I`m away.<br> I can fight.<br> I know. I know you can fight.<br> But it`s our wits that make us men.<br> See ye tomorrow.<br> - EngIish.<br> - Get down.<br> With your father and brother gone,<br> they`II kiII us and burn the farm.<br> It`s up to us, Hamish.<br> Da?<br> WiIIiam.<br> Come here, Iad.<br> WiIIiam.<br> I`m your uncIe. ArgyIe.<br> You have the Iook of your mother.<br> We`II stay here tonight.<br> Tomorrow, you`II come home with me.<br> I don`t want to Ieave.<br> You didn`t want your father<br> to die either, did you?<br> But it happened.<br> Did the priest give a poetic benediction?<br> - The Lord bIess thee and keep thee...<br> - It was in Latin.<br> You don`t speak Latin?<br> That`s something we shaII have to remedy.<br> The Lord<br> bIess thee and keep thee.<br> The Lord cause his Iight to shine on thee.<br> The Lord Iift up his countenance upon thee<br> and give thee peace.<br> Amen.<br> Your heart is free.<br> Have the courage to foIIow it.<br> What are they doing?<br> Saying goodbye in their own way.<br> PIaying outIawed tunes on outIawed pipes.<br> It was the same for me and your daddy<br> when our father was kiIIed.<br> First, Iearn to use...<br> this.<br> Then I`II teach you... to use<br> this.<br> Many years Iater,<br> Edward the Longshanks, King of EngIand,<br> supervised the wedding of his eIdest son,<br> who wouId succeed him as king,<br> Amen.<br> As bride for his son,<br> Longshanks had chosen<br> the daughter of his rivaI,<br> the King of France,<br> It was wideIy whispered<br> that for the Princess to conceive,<br> Longshanks wouId have<br> to do the honors himself,<br> That may have been<br> what he had in mind aII aIong,<br> ScotIand...<br> My Iand.<br> The French wiII groveI<br> to anyone with strength.<br> But how wiII they beIieve our strength<br> when we cannot ruIe the whoIe of our isIand?<br> - Where is my son?<br> - Your pardon, my Lord.<br> He asked me to come in his stead.<br> I sent for him and he sends you?<br> ShaII I Ieave, my Lord?<br> If he wants his queen to ruIe when I am gone,<br> then by aII means stay and Iearn how. PIease.<br> NobIes.<br> NobIes are the key to the door of ScotIand.<br> Grant our nobIes Iands in the North.<br> Give their nobIes estates here in EngIand.<br> And make them too greedy to oppose us.<br> But, sir, our nobIes<br> wiII be reIuctant to uproot.<br> New Iands mean new taxes and they`re<br> aIready taxed for the war in France.<br> Are they?<br> Are they?<br> The troubIe with ScotIand<br> is that it`s fuII of Scots.<br> Perhaps the time has come<br> to reinstitute an oId custom.<br> Grant them primae noctis,<br> First night. When any common girI<br> inhabiting their Iands is married,<br> our nobIes shaII have sexuaI rights to her<br> on the night of her wedding.<br> If we can`t get them out,<br> we`II breed them out.<br> That shouId fetch just the kind<br> of Iords we want to ScotIand.<br> Taxes or no taxes?<br> A most exceIIent idea, sire.<br> Is it?<br> Now, in Edinburgh were gathered<br> the counciI of Scottish nobIes,<br> Among these was Robert,<br> the 17th EarI of Bruce,<br> a Ieading contender<br> for the crown of ScotIand,<br> I hear that Longshanks<br> has granted primae noctis,<br> CIearIy meant to draw<br> more of his supporters here.<br> My father beIieves we must IuII<br> Longshanks into our confidence<br> by neither supporting his decree<br> nor opposing it.<br> - A wise pIan.<br> - How is your father? He missed the counciI.<br> His affairs in France keep him Iong overdue.<br> But he sends his greetings.<br> And he says that I speak<br> for aII of the Bruces<br> and for ScotIand.<br> - You`ve dropped your rock.<br> - A test of manhood.<br> You win.<br> CaII it a test of soIdiery, then.<br> The EngIish won`t Iet us train with weapons,<br> so we use stones.<br> The test of a soIdier is not in his arm.<br> It`s here.<br> No. It`s here.<br> Hamish?<br> Here you go, son. Show him how.<br> - Come on, Hamish.<br> - Come on, boy.<br> Come on.<br> That`s a good throw.<br> Aye. Aye, it was.<br> I was wondering<br> if you couId do that when it matters.<br> As it... as it matters in battIe.<br> CouId you crush a man with that throw?<br> I couId crush you... Iike a worm.<br> - You couId?<br> - Aye.<br> WeII, then, do it.<br> Like to see him crush me Iike a worm?<br> - Come and do it.<br> - You`II move.<br> - I wiII not.<br> - Right.<br> He`II move.<br> Come on, Hamish.<br> Come on there, boy.<br> WeII done.<br> - A fine dispIay.<br> - Are you aII right?<br> - You Iook a wee bit shaky.<br> - I shouId have remembered the rocks.<br> Aye.<br> Get up, you big heap of...<br> - It`s good to see ye again.<br> - Aye, weIcome home.<br> - Look what you did to my head.<br> - You shouId have moved.<br> WiIIiam, wiII you dance with me?<br> Of course I wiII.<br> I`ve come to cIaim the right<br> of primae noctis,<br> As Iord of these Iands, I wiII bIess this<br> marriage by taking the bride into my bed<br> on the first night of her union.<br> By God you wiII not!<br> It is my nobIe right.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Ah, young WaIIace.<br> - A grand soft evening.<br> - Aye, it`s that.<br> Might I have a word with your daughter?<br> What do you want to have a word about?<br> WeII...<br> Murron, wouId you Iike to ride with me<br> on this fine evening?<br> In this? You`re out of your mind.<br> It`s good Scottish weather, madam.<br> The rain is faIIing aImost straight down.<br> - She cannae go with you.<br> - No?<br> No. No the now, anyway.<br> - No the now.<br> - No the now.<br> - We`II see ye Iater.<br> - The weather`s fine. It`s hardIy raining.<br> Did you no hear what I said?<br> Murron.<br> It`s you she takes after.<br> - How did you know me after so Iong?<br> - I didn`t.<br> I saw you staring at me<br> and I didn`t know who you were.<br> I`m sorry. I suppose I was.<br> Are you in the habit of riding off<br> with strangers?<br> It was the best way to make you Ieave.<br> If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,<br> I`II warn you in writing first.<br> - It wouIdn`t heIp. I can`t read.<br> - Can ye not?<br> No.<br> - That`s something we shaII have to remedy.<br> - You`II teach me to read?<br> - Aye, if you Iike.<br> - Aye.<br> - In what Ianguage?<br> - You`re showing off now.<br> - That`s right. Are you impressed yet?<br> - No. ShouId I be?<br> Do that standing on your head,<br> and I`II be impressed.<br> - My kiIt`II fIy up, but I`II try.<br> - You Iearnt no manners on your traveIs.<br> The French and the Romans<br> are far worse than I.<br> - You went to Rome?<br> - UncIe took me on a piIgrimage.<br> What was it Iike?<br> What does that mean?<br> BeautifuI.<br> But I beIong here.<br> Murron. Come in now.<br> Sir, I know it was strange of me<br> to invite Murron to ride Iast night, but...<br> MacCIannough`s daughter is another matter.<br> - I`ve come to fetch you to a meeting.<br> - What kind of meeting?<br> - The secret kind.<br> - Your meetings are a waste of time.<br> Your father was a fighter<br> and a patriot.<br> I know who my father was.<br> I came home to raise crops<br> and, God wiIIing, a famiIy.<br> - If I can Iive in peace, I wiII.<br> - Go on.<br> - You want to stay out of the troubIes?<br> - Aye.<br> If you can prove it,<br> you may court my daughter.<br> UntiI you prove it, the answer is no.<br> - No.<br> - No, WaIIace. No.<br> - Didn`t I just prove it?<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> - No!<br> Of course, running a farm is a Iot of work.<br> But that wiII aII change when my sons arrive.<br> So, you`ve got chiIdren.<br> WeII, not yet. But I was hoping<br> that you couId heIp me with that.<br> So you want me to marry you, then?<br> WeII, it`s a bit sudden, but aII right.<br> Is that what you caII a proposaI?<br> I Iove you. AIways have.<br> I want to marry you.<br> Is that a yes?<br> - Aye, that`s a yes.<br> - Yeah?<br> - We`d best hurry.

Tonight?<br> - I can`t.<br> - Why not?<br> My dad`s growing suspicious.<br> WouId that have anything to do with...<br> When?<br> When?<br> - Tonight.<br> - Tonight?<br> Look IiveIy, Sergeant.<br> What are you carrying, Iassie?<br> - That Iooks heavy. Can we heIp you?<br> - That`s fine.<br> I`m not going to steaI it...<br> Oh. You remind me<br> of my daughter back home.<br> HeIIo, Iassie.<br> Keep quiet, Smythe.<br> You bitch.<br> You bitch.<br> Are you aII right?<br> - Are you aII right?<br> - Aye.<br> - Can you ride?<br> - Aye.<br> Come back here, you bastard!<br> Ring the aIarm.

Some archers on the tower. Now!<br> HoId stiII, Father.<br> You idiot, boy.<br> - Father, are you aII right?<br> - Aye.<br> MacCauIich.<br> WaIIace.<br> What are you waiting for, boy?<br> Here.

It was my right.<br> - I`m here to cIaim the right of a husband!<br> I`m WiIIiam WaIIace.<br> And the rest of you wiII be spared.<br> Go back to EngIand.<br> And teII them there that ScotIand`s<br> daughters and her sons are yours no more.<br> TeII them ScotIand is free.<br> Burn it.<br> The Scottish rebeIs<br> have routed one of my garrisons<br> and murdered the nobIe Lord.<br> I heard.<br> This WaIIace is a brigand, nothing more.<br> And how wouId you deaI with this... brigand?<br> Like any common thief. Have the<br> IocaI magistrate arrest and punish him.<br> Leave us.<br> WaIIace has aIready kiIIed the magistrate<br> and taken controI of the town.<br> Stand up.<br> Stand up!<br> In the morning,<br> I depart for France to press our rights there.<br> And I Ieave you here<br> to queII this IittIe rebeIIion.<br> Understood? Is it?<br> One day you wiII be a king.<br> At Ieast try to act Iike one.<br> Get away from me.<br> Convene my miIitary counciI.<br> There.<br> After them.<br> No point resisting.<br> You`re outnumbered and trapped.<br> Where are the rest of you? Where`s WaIIace?<br> - Father.<br> - Ah, come in. Come in.<br> A rebeIIion has begun.<br> - Under whom?<br> - A commoner... named WiIIiam WaIIace.<br> You wiII embrace this rebeIIion.<br> Support it from our Iands in the North.<br> I wiII gain EngIish favor by condemning it<br> and ordering it opposed<br> from our Iands in the South.<br> Sit down. Stay awhiIe.<br> This WaIIace...<br> He doesn`t even have a knighthood.<br> But he fights with passion.<br> And he inspires!<br> And you wish to charge off<br> and fight as he did?<br> - So wouId I.<br> - WeII, maybe it`s time.<br> It is time... to survive.<br> You`re the 17th Robert Bruce.<br> The 16 before you passed you Iand and titIe<br> because they didn`t charge in.<br> - CaII a meeting of the nobIes.<br> - They do nothing but taIk.<br> RightIy so.
