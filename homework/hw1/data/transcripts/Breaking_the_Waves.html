                        His name is Jan.<br> I do not know him.<br> He's from the rig.<br> You know we do not favour<br> matrimony with outsiders.<br> Can you even tell us what matrimony is?<br> It's when two people are joined in God.<br> Do you really believe you're capable...<br> ...of bearing the responsibility<br> ...not only for your own marriage in God,<br> ...but also another's?<br> I know I am.<br> Can you think of anything of real value...<br> ...that the outsiders have<br> brought with them?<br> Their music.<br> Out you go, Bess McNeill, and be seated.<br> Forgot my six-string razor,<br> ...hit the sky<br> Halfway to Memphis...<br> ...before I realized<br> Well, I rang the information...<br> ...my axe was cold<br> They said she rides<br> a train to Oriole<br> Now it's<br> a mighty long way...<br> Bess.<br> Bess, come on.<br> Don't be silly.<br> He's late.<br> All right, but at least he's coming.<br> Get this on, then.<br> You're going to ruin your dress.<br> He's late.<br> You're being silly.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Bess, get your clothes on.<br> Come on.<br> Don't ruin it.<br> It's a good day.<br> Come on.<br> Bess, you're not supposed to see him.<br>

house,<br> We worship thee as the author...<br> ...of every good and perfect gift.<br> Christ loved the church<br> and gave himself for her.<br> We should love Christ<br> and give ourselves to him.<br> If it is not too inappropriate...<br> ...may I say that you, Bess,<br> ...have shown that love and that<br> commitment in your own life.<br> It is not once or twice...<br> ...that you have been in this building,<br> ...giving your time<br> and effort to cleaning it.<br> I know that you have done that...<br> ...not so as to be<br> well-thought-of here on earth<br> ...but out of your love for God in heaven.<br> Great sermon, father.<br> Ring the bells, then.<br> Our church has no bells.<br> That's not too fun, is it?<br> Whoo!<br> Oh!<br> Yay!<br> Whoo-hoo!<br> Ha, ha!<br> This is Dodo.<br> Oh, the sister-in-law.<br> We haven't really met, have we?<br> No.<br> Well, everything happened so quickly.<br> What makes you say that?<br> I just mean...<br> Well, it did, didn't it?<br>

I married Sam,<br> ...but you welcomed me instantly,<br> ...and I won't ever forget that."<br> "Your generosity knows no bounds,<br> ...like the time when you<br> lent jack a bike...<br> ...because his was broken,<br> only it was mine,<br> ...and I had to walk to work."<br> "I was furious with you then,<br> ...but I regret that now,<br> ...because it's your spirit."<br> "You'd give anything to anyone."<br> "When Sam died, I lost<br> a husband, and you a brother."<br> "We saw each other through that...<br> ...and promised to<br> look after one another."<br> "You are the reason..." sorry.<br> "I have stayed...<br> ...when I almost gave up<br> in this cold place,<br> ...and now your warmth<br> has embraced another outsider."<br> "His name is Jan,<br> ...and I don't know<br> much about him,<br> ...but I'll accept<br> his right to be here...<br> ...because of you, Bess."<br> "If he doesn't take care of you...<br> ...and give you<br> everything you need,<br> ...I'll kill him."<br>

...bloody flowers<br> Push their heads into the air<br> I don't care if I ever know<br> there I go<br> Don't push your love too far<br> Can't get this fucker open.<br> Shit.<br> Da da da...<br> Da da da...<br> What's so funny?<br> Da da da...<br> Hmm.<br> How could you take it?<br> How could you keep away from the boys?<br> I waited for you.<br> No.<br> Don't laugh.<br> Yeah.<br> But you must have been lonely.<br> Who did you talk to?<br> I thank you for the greatest gift of all:<br> the gift of love.<br> I thank you for Jan.<br> I'm so lucky to have been<br> given these gifts.<br> But remember to be a good girl, Bess,<br> ...for you know I giveth<br> and I taketh away.<br> What?<br> I didn't mean it like that.<br> Yes. I'll be good.<br> I'll be really, really good.<br> Thank you.<br> What did you say?<br> Thank you.<br> Fly.<br> Aaaaaway!<br> Oh!<br> Hello, Jan.<br> Hello.<br> Bess.<br> Hello.<br> Why don't you have any church bells?<br> We do not need bells in<br> our church to worship God.<br> I like church bells.<br> Let's put them back again.<br> Have fun.<br> But now, friends,<br> ...things have become very different.<br> It hurts me to have to say it,<br> ...but there appears to be<br> those in the church...<br> ...who are prepared to<br> cling to the world...<br> ...instead of fleeing from it.<br> But those to whom I refer...<br> ...will know what I am speaking about.<br> It grieves my heart,<br> ...and I know there are others...<br> ...who feel just the same.<br> Amen.<br> Mr. Donald John Beaton,<br> will you rise and address the question?<br> Thank you, Lord, for this day<br> you have blessed us with.<br> It's stupid that only men<br> can talk in the service.<br> Hold your tongue, woman.<br> Lassie!<br> It's Lassie!<br> It is Lassie, I know it!<br> Lassie!<br> Oh, Lassie!<br> Lassie.

I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Why should you be any different?<br> Every woman around here<br> has to learn to be alone...<br> ...when their man's away<br> at sea or on the oil rigs.<br> Even you can learn how to endure.<br> I don't even know who you are.<br> I don't know anything about you,<br> ...and quite frankly...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry to say this,<br> ...but I don't trust you.<br> She's...<br> She's very susceptible.<br> And you could get her t...<br> You could get her to do<br> anything you wanted.<br> No.<br> I don't think so.<br> How am I supposed to look out for her now?<br> What do you want to do?<br> Keep her here, locked up<br> for the rest of her life?<br> She hasn't got the strength.<br> She's stronger than you and me.<br> You don't understand, do you?<br> She's not right in the head.<br> Come on.<br> She just wants it all.<br> What's this?<br> What?<br> What?<br> What's that?<br> What's that?<br> It's a present.<br> Can I open it?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Open it.<br> Nice colours, aren't they?<br> Very cheerful.<br> It's open.<br> We've been waiting for you, bud.<br> Hey.<br> Yeah.

Just stay where you are.<br> Go back to sleep.<br> It's terrible.<br> Bess McNeill, for many years,<br> you've prayed for love.<br> Shall I take it away from you again?<br> Is that what you want?<br> Oh, no.<br> I'm still grateful for love.<br> What do you want, then?<br> I pray for Jan to come home.<br> He will be coming home in ten days.<br> You must learn to endure.<br> You know that.<br> Oh, I can't wait.<br> This is unlike you, Bess.<br> Out there, there are people<br> who need Jan and his work.<br> What about them?<br> They don't matter.<br> Nothing else matters.<br> I just want Jan home again.<br> I pray to you.<br> Oh, please, won't you send him home?<br> Are you sure that's what you want?<br> Yes.<br> Ok.<br> Get her up.<br> Blow out!<br> Get away!<br> Blow out!<br> Terry!<br> Terry!<br> Terry!<br> Terry!<br> Terry!<br> Talk to me, will you?<br> Watch out!<br> Jan!<br> Go get... get a medic!<br> I don't know what kind of<br> condition he's in.<br> I think it's very serious, though.<br> I don't quite know.<br> It's Jan.<br> There's been an accident on the rig.<br> Jan, can you hear me?<br> Oh.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm holding your hand.<br> Don't touch me.<br> Don't touch me!<br> Jan, relax.<br> Just take...<br> Sit down here.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> Shh.<br> Deep breath.<br> Hello.<br> Talk to me, darling.<br> Talk to me.<br> Talk to me.<br> Come on.<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> It's going to be all right.<br> Uh, they're going to operate straight away.<br> It will be a few hours,<br> ...so I think we better wait...<br> Bess.<br> Bess, you can't go in there.<br> It's not allowed.<br> I want to be with him.<br> I know you do.<br> I know.<br> But come on. Come with me.<br> Come on.<br> No.<br> I want to see him all the time.<br> Bess, it's not a good idea.<br> Come on.<br> Bess.<br> Bess, please, you can't stay here.<br> It's just not possible.<br> Bess!<br> Can I have a word with you?<br> Stay there, all right?<br> Don't move.<br> I want you to pray with me.<br> But...<br> Please.<br> Dear god, we pray that you...<br> ...will hold your hand<br> over Jan...<br> ...and not let him die.<br> Amen.<br> Mrs. Nyman, will you please come with me?<br> Will he live?<br> We have stabilized your husband's<br> condition for the time being.<br> Will he live?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, Bess, he will live.<br> Your husband suffered<br> very serious injuries.<br> Life shouldn't always<br> be preserved at any cost.<br> What do you mean?<br> Um, well, the doctor means, Bess...<br> ...that, um, sometimes...<br> ...in some cases when<br> life isn't worth living,<br> ...then it may<br> be better to die.<br> You don't know Jan, or you<br> could not say such a thing.<br> Your husband may never walk again.<br> We think he'll be completely paralysed.<br> But he'll live?<br> Yes.<br> He will live, it seems.<br> Father.<br> Are you there?<br> Are you still there?<br> Of course I am, Bess.<br> You know that.<br> What's happening?<br> You wanted Jan home.<br> I've changed my mind.<br> Why did I ask for that?<br> Because you're...<br> ...a stupid little girl, Bess.<br> I had to test you.<br> Your love for Jan<br> has been put to the test.<br> Thank you...<br> ...for not letting him die.<br> You're welcome, Bess.<br> He said "there is no reason<br> And the truth is plain to see"<br> But I wandered<br> through my playing cards<br> And would not let her be<br> One of 16 vestal virgins<br> Who were leaving<br> for the coast<br> And although<br> my eyes were open<br> They might just as well<br> have been closed<br> And so it was...<br> I would say to you...<br> ...that if there is one of<br> these commandments...<br> ...which you do not love<br> and do not obey,<br> ...you have no place<br> at the Lord's table.<br> When did you get back?<br> I came back with Jan.<br> Oh, it's good to see you.<br> Oh, surf's up!<br> Hi.<br> Hi, guys.<br> How you doing, buddy?<br> Well, fine.<br> How are you?<br> Ok.<br> Did you find anything?<br> Gas.<br> Nothing really.<br> Ha ha!<br> Guess what, now.<br> We're heading up north.<br> Well, north, that's good.<br> That's where you always said the oil was.<br> What are you doing here, anyway?<br> We're meant to be out drilling.<br> I just felt like...<br> Putting my feet up for a while.<br> I didn't trust you<br> two guys out there alone.<br> Oh, my...<br> My arms aren't ok, so...<br> I'm not thirsty, anyway.<br> Bullshit!<br> Hey, come on.<br> Come on.<br> Oh, man, sorry.<br> Oh, man, sorry.<br> Ok.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm not really supposed to<br> have any visitors, so...<br> We really don't have the time, either.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Ok.<br> You take care of yourself, huh?<br> Take care.<br> Get well soon.<br> See you, guys.<br> Will you do something for me?<br> Yes.<br> The next time you come,<br> ...could you wear something more...<br> More loose...<br> So I, uh...<br> So I won't have to see your body.<br> Bess, you'll have to go now...<br> ...because Jan needs to rest.<br> All right.<br> You shouldn't get him<br> too overemotional, you know.<br> It's not good for him.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You got to cheer him up.<br> Is he asleep now?<br> Well, he should be...<br> ...the amount I've given him.<br> Would it be all right...<br> ...If I went and had a look at him?<br> I love you, Jan.<br> I love you, too, Bess.<br> You are the love of my life.<br> Bess.<br> Where have you been?<br> I've been to the church.<br> What, at 2:00 in the morning?<br> I don't want you getting ill again...<br> ...like you did when Sam died.<br> I said I've been to the church.<br> It has nothing to do with the church.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> Did you?<br> I don't want you to get ill again.<br> Like you did when Sam died.<br> I've had a word with Dr. Richardson,<br> all right?<br> And he says he could see you tomorrow.<br> Oh, can he?<br> Bess, would you like to come in?<br> Dodo said I had to come.<br> She has this idea about me treating you.<br> My predecessor admitted you<br> a few years ago.<br> Well, why did he do that?<br> I don't know.<br> No, nor do I.<br> You were upset because<br> your brother had died...<br> ...and now you're upset<br> because your husband's ill.<br> Nothing unusual about that.<br> Am I not going to have some pills?<br> I'm probably not like your old doctor.<br> I don't think that people<br> should be given pills...<br> ...just because they do<br> what's only natural.<br> Maybe showing what you feel<br> isn't the done thing...<br> ...from where you come from,<br> ...but it's certainly no disease.<br> What... happened on the rig...<br> ...was my fault.<br> How come?<br> I prayed to God to send him home.<br> Well...<br> Well...<br> What powers you possess.<br> Do you really...<br> Do you really believe<br> that you possess such powers?<br> I know you people believe<br> a lot about yourselves.<br> Bess...<br> Perhaps you should do a bit of grieving...<br> ...for yourself instead of him.<br> I think you should come and see me...<br> ...now and again if you feel like it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh.<br> Ha ha!<br> Come on.<br> Well, things will pick up<br> once he gets home again.<br> Well, she's my woman of gold<br> Yes, she's not very old,<br> uh-huh, huh<br> Well, she's my woman of gold<br> Yes, she's not very old,<br> uh-huh, huh<br> I don't mean to be bold, uh<br> But, uh, may I hold your hand?<br> Well, she ain't no witch<br> and I love the way she twitch<br> uh-huh, huh<br> Well, she ain't no witch<br> and I love the way she twitch<br> uh-huh, huh...<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Squashed tomatoes and stew<br> You look like a monkey<br> and I thought it was you<br> Look at that.<br> Special.<br> Shall I open your present?<br> Yes.<br> Your presents.<br> Can you see all right?<br> What is it?<br> Wait and see.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> I don't believe it.<br> Where did you get that?<br> I got it in a shop.<br> That is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.<br> Oh, look, it's not doing anything now.<br> Ahem. All right, go on.<br> Well, go on.<br> That is just terrible.<br> That is daft, that is completely daft.<br> Happy birthday, Jan.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Do you like it?<br> Oh, yes, it's...<br> Ha ha!<br> It's... it's nice.<br> I'll give you your pill.<br> Ok?<br> Oh...<br> One more drink.<br> Ok?<br> Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> Happy birthday.<br> I'm finished, Bess.<br> No.<br> You could take a lover...<br> ...without anybody noticing...<br> ...but you can't divorce me.<br> They'd never let you.<br> Bess.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Is that what you think I want?<br> You cripple!<br> You must make up with him.<br> A husband and wife...<br> ...have to be able to talk to each other.<br> He's the one who is helpless,<br> ...and you're the one...<br> ...who must show you're strong.<br> Go to him and tell him...<br> ...you are sorry you were angry.<br> You have God.<br> You have the strength...<br> ...your life in God has bestowed upon you,<br> ...and that is a strength<br> he does not possess.<br> Oh, no.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> You're all right.<br> Come on.<br> That's it.<br> That's it.<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> All right, all right.<br> What's she thinking of...<br> Going off leaving you like this?<br> You must admit that she was...<br> She was happy when we got married.<br> She blossomed...<br> Didn't she?<br> I can't just lie here.<br> I can't even make love to her.<br> She's got to get out of here.<br> She's got to get on with life.<br> Help me set her free.<br> She'd do anything for you, Jan.<br> You know that.<br> She don't care... anything about herself...<br> ...but she'd do anything for you...<br> just to see a smile on your face.<br> Do you understand me?<br> Yeah.<br> Right.<br> Thanks for telling me.<br> No trouble.<br> Do you want me to read to you?<br> Hmm?<br> Are you all right?<br> They took him back to the hospital.<br> Bess.<br> Bess, what is going on?<br> He went unconscious.<br> We had to bring him back here.<br> At home any more...<br> Not if you're going to go running off...<br> ...and leaving him like that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well, it's just not good enough!<br> I'm not... I'm not even allowed<br> to kiss him any more.<br> Why don't you try listening to<br> what he says, Bess?<br> It's up to you.<br> He ain't got anyone else.<br> You could give him the will to live.<br> That's more than any doctor can do.<br> Bess?<br> I'm sorry.<br> No, it was my fault.<br> Come here.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Love is a mighty power...<br> Isn't it?<br> If I die...<br> It will be because love<br> cannot keep me alive.<br> But I can hardly remember...<br> ...what it's like to make love.<br> And if I forget that...<br> ...then I'll die.<br> Remember when I phoned you from the rig?<br> We made love without being together.<br> Do you want me to talk<br> to you like that again?<br> I'd love to.<br> Bess.<br> I want you to find<br> a man to make love to...<br> ...and then come back here<br> and tell me about it.<br> It will feel like you and me<br> being together again.<br> Now, that... that will keep me alive.<br> I... I can't.<br> This morning when I...<br> When I told you to get a lover,<br> It wasn't for your sake.<br> It was for my sake...<br> ...because I don't want to die.<br> I'm afraid.<br> Do you understand?<br> Yes.<br> It will be you and me, Bess.<br> Do it for me.<br> I...<br> I can't.<br> Please.<br> Bess?<br> Are you all right?<br> Sure?<br> Here you go.<br> Whoa-oh.<br> Easy.<br> Suzanne takes you down...<br> ...to her place near the river<br> You can hear the boats go by,<br> ...you can spend the night, beside her.<br> And you know<br> that she's half crazy,<br> But that's why<br> you want to be there<br> and she feeds you<br> tea and oranges...<br> ...that come all the way from China<br> And just when you mean<br> to tell her,<br> that you have no love<br> to give her<br> Then she gets you<br> on her wavelength<br> And she lets the river answer<br> That you've always been her lover<br> You certainly needed some shut-eye.<br> I put your rose in a vase.<br> Perked up a bit.<br> You should think of yourself a bit, too.<br> Go out.<br> Go dancing.<br> I've seen you dance.<br> You like to dance.<br> Where's Jan?<br> There's nothing you can do in here.<br> Don't let him die.<br> And why shouldn't I let him die?<br> I love him.<br> So you keep saying, but I don't see it.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> There's nothing at all.<br> Prove to me that you love him...<br> ...and then I'll let him live.<br> I've come to dance.<br> It's great. You're great.<br> Great movement...<br> But, um, maybe you could talk to me.<br> And love lies bleeding in my hand<br> Oh, it kills me to think<br> of you with another man<br> I was playing...<br> Bess, stop dancing.<br> Talk to me.<br> But my guitar couldn't hold you<br> So I split the band<br> Bess...<br> Talk to me.<br> Give me five minutes.<br> You can touch me now.<br> You can have me now.<br> Bess, listen to me.<br> We're not going to make love.<br> Now put your clothes back on.<br> Don't you want me?<br> Don't you like me?<br> You said that you liked me.<br> Yes, Bess, I like you.<br> Now put your clothes on.<br> But you don't understand.<br> I'll...<br> I'll be good to you, and...<br> I want us to make love.<br> Listen.<br> Um, Bess,<br> If you want to talk to me...<br> ...we can meet at the hospital.<br> Now just put your clothes on, Bess.<br> No...<br> Please.<br> I don't know what to do with you.<br> All right, now just put<br> your clothes on, Bess,<br> ...and go home.<br> No.<br> I'm lying on my back, all naked.<br> And...<br> ...he comes in, and he sees me.<br> And he kisses my breasts.<br> Um...<br> And he enters me...<br> And...<br> And he's making love to me...<br> Gently...<br> And...<br> He's coming.<br> It was Dr. Richardson.<br> Hi.<br> Hi, Bess.<br> Where are you going, then?<br> Jan, we're going to<br> take you off the respirator...<br> ...for five minutes to exercise<br> your lungs a little bit...<br> ...and see how you are,<br> ...so just relax and take it easy.<br> Ok, start to breathe by yourself, now, Jan.<br> Just take very deep breaths.<br> Slowly.<br> That's it.<br> And again.<br> Very good.<br> Deep breaths.<br> Now, that's it.<br> Bess.<br> Yes?<br> What are you doing on this bus?<br> Which bus, Jan?<br> Come to me.<br> Come.<br> I'm here.<br> I'm here in the back.<br> Yes.<br> In the back of the bus.<br> Yeah.<br> Come.<br> Dodo.<br> Dodo.<br> Jan.<br> Go and get Dr. Richardson.<br> I'm going to put you back<br> on the respirator now, Jan.<br> Jan, can you hear me?<br> Are you awake?<br> Talk to me.<br> Hi, Bess.<br> I'd like to have a chat with you.<br> Bess.<br> This is my bus... My bus.<br> Forgive me, father.<br> I have sinned.<br> Mary Magdalene sinned,<br> ...and she is among my dearly beloved.<br> I go to the back of the bus...<br> ...and you're there.<br> And you're so huge...<br> ...that you're almost<br> bursting out of your pants.<br> And I undo your fly...<br> ...and I touch you.<br> I'm touching your prick.<br> Have you been in to see Jan?<br> How is he?<br> Better.<br> He's better?<br> Just a bit.<br> Hey, Bess, it looks like...<br> ...your prayers have been answered.<br> We've been able to take<br> him off the respirator.<br> Good news, isn't it?<br> Do you think...<br> ...that we turn to different people<br> ...when we get close to the edge?<br> And that we, um...<br> ...we turn bad when we're going to die?<br> You're not going to die.<br> I know you're not.<br> I promise you.<br> When are you<br> gonna come down?<br> When are you going to land?<br> I should have stayed<br> on the farm<br> I should have listened<br> to my old man?<br> You know you can't hold me forever<br> I didn't sign up with you<br> I'm not a present<br> for your friends to open<br> This boy's too young to be singing...<br> ...the blues...<br> Oh, look.<br> Here you go.<br> Hey, hey, girlies!<br> We found some shroomies!<br> Don't get your hopes up too high, will you?<br> Dr. Richardson says that<br> Jan could get worse again.<br> I'm the one who saved his life.<br> I can save it again.<br> Bess, what are you talking about?<br> I told Jan stories...<br> Stories about love.<br> That was almost like<br> being together, him and me.<br> You see, love can save Jan.<br> He must not forget about love.<br> He told me that.<br> He tells me what to do.<br> Bess, I'm glad that you listened to Jan,<br> ...but don't let him gain<br> too much power over you.<br> Sickness is a mighty power.<br> I've saved Jan.<br> Don't talk like that.<br> It's stupid!<br> You always said that I wasn't stupid.<br> Well, you're stupid if you<br> say things like that.<br> Why are you saying I'm stupid now?<br> Because I can see<br> that you're disappearing...<br> ...into a world<br> of make-believe,<br> ...and it worries me.<br> I used to go mad...<br> ...when people called you stupid,<br> But... you are stupid!<br> We're going to put<br> a drain in this afternoon.<br> It'll be much easier<br> to get through to him.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's a very minor operation.<br> Are you trying to make me feel guilty?<br> What makes you say that?<br> I think she's trying<br> to make me feel guilty.<br> Come here.<br> You look fucking awful.<br> Why do you dress like that?<br> You dress like a widow.<br> I'm not even dead yet.<br> Maybe you wish I was.<br> No.<br> No, no.<br> You haven't done what I asked you to do.<br> I have!<br> I asked you to be with a man.<br> I have done that.<br> You call that being with a man?<br> I call it a joke.<br> I love you.<br> I don't love some other man.<br> Prove it.<br> Bess, what is going on?<br> Are you sleeping with other men<br> to feed his sick fantasies?<br> He did get better.<br> No, he did not get better!<br> That's just the way it goes, Bess.<br> Sometimes he's better;<br> Sometimes he's worse.<br> It has nothing to do with what you're doing.<br> That's all in your mind.<br> He is my husband, and god has<br> said that I must honour him.<br> Well, if that's what<br> honouring is all about...<br> ...then I must have something wrong.<br> Well, you don't come from<br> around here, do you?<br> No, and I'm glad I don't.<br> With locals talking.<br> It makes me sick.<br> But you live here,<br> and you go to the church.<br> Yes, but it don't mean I don't<br> look at things me own way.<br> Why don't you move, then?<br> Your husband's dead.<br> You know very well why I don't move.<br> I don't move because of you.<br> A woman has to choose for herself, Bess.<br> She has to have a mind of her own.<br> Now, what you're doing is making<br> things worse. It's nonsense.<br> His head's full of scars.<br> He's up to his eyeballs in drugs.<br> He doesn't know what he's saying.<br> And he doesn't know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Am I going to go to hell?<br> Whom do you want to save...<br> yourself or Jan?<br> Bess.<br> It's been a long time... most unlike you.<br> I must warn you that<br> the Lord looks with anger...<br> ...upon those who fail him.<br> You've got to lend me something to wear.<br> A good shot.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> Hello.<br> Good shot.<br> How much, darling?<br> Ok.<br> Good.<br> Thank you.<br> I can't hear the blood pressure.<br> The blood pressure.<br> We have a fibrillation.<br> Clear.<br> Still no change.<br> Ok.<br> Clear.<br> Clear again, please.<br> Go on.<br> Clear, please.<br> Yes!<br> Oh, yes!<br> All right.<br> Good work.<br> Good work.<br> It's ok?<br> Hi, Bess.<br> Bess...<br> Bess, I think it's time<br> we had a little chat.<br> I love you no matter what is in your head.<br> So you didn't have to give Jan...<br> ...electric shock treatment<br> when his heart stopped...<br> ...in the operation yesterday?<br> No, we didn't.<br> It was a perfectly simple operation.<br> As you know.<br> Well...<br> I shouldn't have to say that.<br> You know that very well.<br> I want a word with Bess on her own.<br> Thank you, Dorothy.<br> I'm not going to ask you<br> what you've been getting up to...<br> ...because I don't want<br> to hear you lie to me,<br> ...but as long as you are<br> living under my roof,<br> ...you are to behave<br> like a decent human being.<br> I have never lied to you.<br> Do you understand me?<br> Yes, mother.<br> This is very painful for me.<br> Your grandfather can no longer<br> hold his hand over you with the elders.<br> I don't think you realize what that means.<br> Have you any idea<br> what it's like to be cast out?<br> You will have nothing, Bess.<br> I've known strong men and women...<br> ...wither away after being cast out.<br> Now, you are not strong.<br> You're a feeble girl.<br> It would kill you, Bess.<br> I've said enough.<br> Bess.<br> Bess.<br> Can you come down a minute, love?<br> Dr. Richardson is here.<br> Hi, Bess.<br> Hello.<br> How are you?<br> Can we sit down?<br> Uh-huh.<br> Bess...<br> I think... I think you've got yourself...<br> ...involved in something...<br> ...which is out of your control.<br> Have I?<br> Come on, Bess.<br> You're not a kid any more.<br> Look, for Christ's sake,<br> ...he's forcing you to get screwed...<br> ...by every Tom, Dick, and Harry.<br> It's just not you.<br> I don't make love with them.<br> I make love with Jan...<br> ...and I save him from dying.<br> Well, I'm sorry, but you know,<br> To me, he seems more<br> like a dirty old man...<br> ...who wants to play the peeping Tom.<br> Sometimes...<br> I don't even have to tell him about it.<br> Jan and me...<br> We have a spiritual contact.<br> God gives everyone something to be good at.<br> I've always been stupid...<br> But I'm good at this.<br> God gives everyone a talent.<br> And what's Jan's talent?<br> He is...<br> He's a great lover.<br> Well, what's... what's mine, then?<br> I don't know.<br> Haven't you found it yet?<br> I see.<br> And what's your talent, then, Bess?<br> Because, um...<br> Oh, surely it can't be being screwed...<br> ...by men you've never seen before.<br> I can believe.<br> Are you angry now?<br> Yes, I am!<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm angry...<br> ...because you can't see that<br> he's messing you about.<br> He's the one who's sick.<br> Look, what he's doing to you is sick,<br> and it's getting sicker and sicker.<br> He's becoming more<br> and more of a danger to you<br> the more the fluid rises in his...<br> ...listen to me, for god's sake!<br> Do you always get so involved...<br> ...in your patients' problems,<br> Dr. Richardson?<br> Listen to me, Bess.<br> I care for you.<br> I love you, Bess.<br> You're very special.<br> Will you move your hands, please?<br> Certainly.<br> Dodo.<br> Will you show Dr. Richardson out, please?<br> W...what's going to happen now, Bess?<br> Um, has he told you any more...<br> ...of the thoughts he's had?<br> Any more services for you to perform?<br> Don't come here again.<br> Oh, he has, has he?<br> And what's it going to be this time?<br> What are you going to give him<br> to slobber over this time?<br> Dear father, what's going on?<br> Father, where are you?<br> That boy scared me.<br> Hello.<br> Can you take me out to the ships?<br> Can't take you out there.<br> The other girls wouldn't like it.<br> But they can't do all the ships.<br> They don't have time.<br> Maybe not.<br> What about the big one?<br> I don't go out to that one any more.<br> Girls won't go aboard.<br> Well, then you can take me.<br> No harm done.<br> How are you feeling, Jan?<br> Well, I've felt better.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Unfortunately, the periods...<br> ...in which we can get through to you...<br> ...have lately become very rare.<br> I'll have to send you back to Glasgow...<br> ...for a while, I'm afraid.<br> I don't want any more...<br> ...operations.<br> Of course, it's entirely up to you,<br> ...but...<br> I have to say that your<br> condition's unlikely to improve...<br> ...without surgery.<br> Well, if you've made<br> your mind up on that point,<br> Um, maybe it's time<br> to consider other matters.<br> I mean, we should start thinking<br> about other people than just you.<br> Bess.<br> I'm glad you understand<br> what I'm driving at.<br> Your... your condition's been-<br> it's been very hard on her.<br> And I can't judge why,<br> but she's suffering...<br> ...from delusions regarding your condition.<br> I have to be blunt.<br> I don't think that<br> seeing you is good for her.<br> I guess not.<br> I am convinced that the best thing<br> ...we can do for her right now...<br> is to admit her again.<br> Get her away?<br> Yes.<br> As far away as possible.<br> Think that's necessary?<br> Listen, if you don't want surgery,<br> ...the indications are that we<br> will enter a prolonged period...<br> ...in which you will be more and<br> more affected by your condition.<br> The poorlier you are, the more<br> detrimental your influence on Bess.<br> I've drawn up some papers giving<br> me the authority to detain her...<br> ...under the provisions<br> of the mental health act.<br> I'll need your consent.<br> You're going to section Bess?<br> It's the only way I can get her treated.<br> Tell me, Dr. Richardson, does...<br> ...does this mean I will<br> never see her again?<br> To be realistic, yes.<br> It's just there at the bottom.<br> You said you wanted to help her.<br> Come on, Jan.<br> If you've been bad<br> Lord, I bet you have<br> And you've not been hit<br> You've not been hit<br> by flying lead<br> You'd better<br> close your eyes<br> You'd better<br> bow your head<br> Wait for the ricochet<br> Ooh ooh ooh<br> Ooh ooh ooh<br> Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br> How do I get back?<br> I'll keep an eye out for you.<br> Hello.<br> What do you want?<br> I want that you do it<br> with the sailor and I watch.<br> Ok.<br> It's all right.<br> It's ok.<br> All right.<br> Come here, you.<br> No!<br> There we go, eh?<br> Yeah.<br> That's better.<br> Come on down.<br> Yeah.<br> You like it like this, eh?<br> Oh, please.<br> Can I go home now?<br> No. No.<br> Can I go home now?<br> Please, I don't want...<br> Stay still.<br> No.<br> Please.<br> No. No. Please.<br> Please.<br> Stay still, I said.<br> Stay still, I said.<br> Stay still, I said.<br> No.<br> Aah!<br> Bitch!<br> I'm going to shoot you.<br> You will, huh?<br> I'm going to shoot you.<br> You think so?<br> You don't even know how to use that thing.<br> Nobody will believe a hooker!<br> Because there is only one thing for us,<br> ...sinners that we are,<br> ...to achieve perfection<br> in the eyes of God...<br> ...through unconditional love...<br> ...for the word that is written,<br> ...through unconditional love for the law.<br> I don't understand what you're saying.<br> How can you love a word?<br> Love words.<br> You cannot be in love with a word.<br> You can love another human being.<br> That's perfection.<br> No woman speaks here.<br> Bess McNeill, the kirk session...<br> ...has decided this day that henceforth,<br> ...you shall no longer<br> have access to this kirk.<br> They who know you shall not know you.<br> Please, let me stay!<br> Please!<br> Be gone, Bess McNeill,<br> from the house of God.<br> Hello, Bess.<br> You're... you're coming with us.<br> We're going to Glasgow.<br> Bess, they're going to take you...<br> ...back into hospital<br> just for a little bit.<br> It's for your own good.<br> I want to see Jan.<br> I want to see my husband.<br> I know, but not now, Bess.<br> It's for your own good, Bess.<br> Mother can't have me admitted.<br> Not now that I'm married.<br> Bess, it wasn't mother<br> that signed the paper.<br> It was Jan.<br> You liar!<br> Come along, Bess.<br> Jan!<br> Jan!<br> Dodo, how can you do this?<br> You had a husband, too, once.<br> Your love could have saved him,<br> if only you'd tried!<br> Jan!<br> Jan!<br> Ok, Bess.<br> Let's go.<br> Oh, fuck!<br> Ryan, she's not here!<br> Hello.<br> Who's a tart?<br> What are you doing?<br> Who's a tart?<br> Who's a tart?<br> Tart!<br> Tart!<br> I can't open the door.<br> Mother?<br> Please.<br> Please, mother, open the door!<br> Please, open the

Let's go.<br> There we go.<br> It's all right, love.<br> Now, Bess, do you know me?<br> Yeah.<br> Pulse 90.<br> What happened?<br> Do you know?<br> No.<br> Pressure on 100.<br> Get the blood pressure.<br> It will be all right, love.<br> It will be all right.<br> Can I have a look at her back?<br> There we go.<br> Ok.<br> Hand me the scissors.<br> Yes.<br> All right.<br> Mother.<br> Oh, mother.<br> Here she is.<br> Bessie.<br> Bess.<br> I'm sorry that I<br> could not be good, mother.<br> That's all right, Bessie.<br> Your grandfather's<br> sorry he couldn't come.<br> Will you tell him that I love him?<br> I am glad that you came, mother.<br> Blood pressure.<br> It will be all right.<br> It's going down.<br> Ok, we're just going to lower you down<br> a little bit now, all right, Bess?<br> There we go.<br> That was easy, wasn't it?<br> Going to be all right.<br> Oh.

If you'd, um,<br> if you were to ask me again...<br> ...to write... um...<br> the conclusion, then...<br> ...instead of writing "neurotic"...<br> ...or, um, "psychotic," then I might...<br> ...just, um, use a word like...<br> "Good."<br> Good?<br> Yes.<br> You wish the records of this court...<br> ...to state that in your medical opinion,<br> ...the deceased was suffering<br> from being "good"?<br> Perhaps this was<br> the psychological defect...<br> ...that led to her death.<br> Is that what we shall write,<br> Dr. Richardson?<br> No.<br> Of course not.<br> Very well, then.<br> Perhaps we should stick to your<br> original statement then, doctor.<br> Yes.<br> I think that everything there is to say...<br> ...about Bess McNeill<br> has been said already.<br> We have agreed to sanction her burial,<br> ...but there can be no funeral service.<br> The fact that some of us<br> knew the deceased girl well...<br> ...cannot be allowed to<br> influence the form of her burial.<br> Bess McNeill's funeral must be the same...<br> ...as anyone else of her kind.<br> The body will be released by<br> the authorities sometime this week.<br> I've obtained permission from<br> the elders to bury Bess...<br> but... I cannot deviate from the principles<br> that apply to funerals here.<br> I must say about Bess what must be said.<br> Ok.<br> Come on.<br> Where's Jan?<br> Has he gone down there yet?<br> I don't know.<br> Have you seen Jan?<br> Bess McNeill, you are a sinner,<br> ...and for your sins,<br> you are consigned to hell.<br> Not one of you has the right...<br> ...to consign Bess to hell.<br> Terry, it's time.<br> Let's do it.<br> Get up, for Christ's sake.<br> Come on, man.<br> Come on.<br> Take good care of her.<br> Come on, Jan.<br> You got to let her go.<br> Bess!<br> Jan.<br> Jan, hey.<br> What?<br> What's the matter?<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> I want to show you something.<br> You're not going to believe it.<br> What?<br> Come on.<br> Please.<br> Here.<br> Let's go.<br> Pim!<br> Pim, come on!<br> You're not going to believe it.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Hey, Pim, Come on.<br> Check this out.<br> Check this thing out, man.<br> You see anything?<br> There's nothing out there.<br> I've tried all the fucking ranges,<br> ...and there's nothing there.<br> I just wanted to be sure.<br> Come on.<br>
