I mean, I don't know.<br> Do people really change?<br> I think they do.<br> Yeah, but, I mean,<br> they still stay<br> who they are, pretty much.<br> I think we change<br> all the time.<br> I think we stay the same,<br> but grow,<br> I guess, a little bit.<br> I think if you are growing,<br> then you are changing.<br> But, I mean, we are changing<br> from who we are,<br> which we always stay as.<br> Not really,<br> I don't think so.<br> I think so.<br> I don't.<br> Annie! These are my kids.<br> Step-kids.<br> Step.<br> They are so hilarious.<br> Funny.<br> Excuse me,<br> my husband's kids.<br> What are<br> you guys up to?<br> Going to the snack bar.<br> Awesome.

That's it.<br> She's been here<br> long enough.<br> The three of us live here,<br> it's not fair for<br> me to be paying half.<br> We split it three ways.<br> What do you say?<br> Well, she can't work.<br> She's on a tourist visa.<br> Yeah. So, technically,<br> I'm only allowed to tour.<br> Well, you know...<br> I have no way<br> of earning money,<br> unless I just<br> go and prostitute<br> down on the street.<br> I don't want you<br> to do that, no.<br> "Hello, fellas.<br> Here I am."<br> Yeah, but we...<br> "Put your American sausage<br> "in my English McMuffin."<br> No, we did that.<br> All right.<br> Okay, I don't even know<br> what you're<br> talking about any more.<br> There's three<br> people living here.<br> Yeah.<br> If she doesn't<br> start paying...<br> I'm not.<br> ...she has to leave.<br> Is this about<br> the diary again?<br> What diary?<br> Your diary proved<br> very interesting to read.<br> You read my...<br> You read my journal?<br> At first, I did not know<br> that it was your diary.<br> I thought it was<br> a very sad,<br> hand-written book.<br> What? That does not<br> make any...<br> But, because of<br> the deep personal details<br> and the bits that<br> mentioned Gil and Brynn...<br> No, no, no, no.<br> - Don't read my journal!<br> - And the crumbs.<br> Then...<br> Don't go in my room!<br> Well, hello! I think,<br> before you make<br> those sort of demands,<br> you need to,<br> maybe, think about<br> putting a note on<br> your door saying,<br> "Do not come into my room,<br> read my diary and<br> wear my clothes."<br> Wow, I've never been<br> to this part of town before.<br> Look, you can get<br> your checks cashed<br> next door.<br> I know it looks<br> a little scary<br> on the outside,<br> but the food<br> is really good,<br> authentic Brazilian.<br> I'm telling you,<br> this is where<br> Brazilians come to eat.<br> I got to say, Annie's<br> really good at this.<br> She always drags me<br> to the weirdest places<br> and the food is<br> always incredible.<br> And plus, you get<br> a lot for your money, too.<br> So that's good.<br> All right.<br> Let's do it.<br> Let's do it.<br> Whoa! Somebody<br> likes Brazilian food.<br> To my bridesmaids.<br> - Cheers.<br> - Cheers.<br> Cheers to Lil!<br> This is such a stone-cold<br> pack of weirdos,<br> and I'm so proud.<br> And I just want to toast<br> all of you ladies.<br> I'm so happy to<br> get to know you guys,<br> and happy to say<br> that I have four<br> new friends.<br> Absolutely. Cheers.<br> So, Annie,<br> do you have a date<br> for the wedding?<br> Um...<br> I don't... I don't think<br> I'm bringing anybody,<br> I guess.<br> Please, can I<br> set you up? Please?<br> Annie, you can't go<br> to the wedding alone.<br> Please?<br> If you go alone,<br> people might think<br> you're a prostitute.<br> Maybe.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I hope that you're all hungry<br> What would you like?<br> Yeah, I'll have<br> some of that, please.<br> I'll start with this.<br> I'd say yes.<br> Hello, chicken.<br> This is crazy<br> good, ya'll.<br> Helen, aren't you<br> eating any meat?<br> It's not good<br> to eat a big meal<br> before a fitting.<br> I feel a bit<br> bloated, so...<br> Not me.<br> No?<br> No. Physically,<br> I don't bloat.<br> Lucky.<br> That is lucky.<br> It's a gift.<br> I can't wait to be married<br> for as long as you've been<br> married.<br> And to have kids.<br> And be a mom.<br> Becca?<br> Yeah?<br> The other night,<br> I'm slaving away,<br> making a beautiful<br> dinner for my family.<br> My youngest boy<br> comes in and says<br> he wants to order a pizza.<br> I said, "No, we're not<br> ordering pizza tonight."<br> He goes,<br> "Mom, why don't you go<br> and fuck yourself?"<br> He's nine.<br> Okay, now that<br> Lillian's in the bathroom,<br> I just wanted to<br> talk to you guys about<br> the shower really quick.<br> I was thinking it<br> could be French-themed,<br> since she's always wanted<br> to go to Paris her whole life.<br> So I figured we<br> could bring Paris here<br> and have champagne<br> and little cookies.<br> They'd say "Lillian<br> and Dougie" on them.<br> We can dip them in<br> chocolate fondue,<br> and get cheese from<br> the nice part of the store.<br> I love that.<br> Good idea, Annie.<br> We can have<br> French invitations,<br> the whole thing.<br> Don't you think<br> that'd be nice?<br> That's adorable!<br> That's really cute.<br> Good. Great.<br> I don't know.<br> It's really cute.<br> But I feel like,<br> personally, the Paris theme's<br> a bit,<br> "Been there, done that."<br> I just feel<br> like we can top it.<br> We should throw<br> some ideas around.<br> See if anyone else<br> has a theme they had in mind<br> or something<br> they'd been thinking of.<br> What about<br> a Pixar-themed shower?<br> And we all come dressed<br> as our favorite<br> Pixar character.<br> That, and I'll just<br> snowball on top of that,<br> also Fight Club.<br> Female fight club.<br> We grease up,<br> we pull in.<br> Lillian doesn't know,<br> so it's, "Surprise!<br> We're going to fight!"<br> We beat the shit out of her.<br> She's not going<br> to forget that.<br> We just fucking attack.<br> Can I be honest?<br> No.<br> I'm at home with<br> three boys all day,<br> every day.<br> What about<br> the bachelorette party?<br> That's what's more important.<br> I've got a new tube top,<br> I want to cut the tags off.<br> I'd like to take<br> advantage of this opportunity.<br> Where are we going?<br> I'm going<br> to second her.<br> We'd better<br> blow this shit out.<br> Yeah.<br> That poor girl, Lillian,<br> who we're all here for,<br> is in the bathroom<br> probably bawling her<br> fucking eyes out.<br> Because she's realizing,<br> "Holy shit!<br> "I've got to spend<br> the rest of my life<br> with Doug."<br> He's my brother. I love him.<br> But he is a fucking asshole.<br> I think we can all<br> agree on that, right?<br> We can...<br> We'll figure it out.<br> I mean, I can think of stuff,<br> and it will be great.<br> We just have to make sure<br> it's really, really special.<br> Belle en Blanc?<br> This is the place.<br> Great job, Annie.<br> Thanks.<br> Annie.<br> Belle en Blanc.<br> Reservation name?<br> I don't have one.<br> We're just here to shop,<br> just to try on some dresses.<br> Okay.

This is<br> my son, Tyler.<br> Hi, Tyler.<br> Hi.<br> These things are<br> always so awkward.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm not really a setup guy.<br> Me, either.<br> But Becca spoke<br> so highly of you.<br> She had a lot of<br> really nice things<br> to say about you, too.<br> That's nice to hear.<br> I'm going to go upstairs,<br> throw on a couple<br> of finishing touches.<br> The babysitter's not here yet,<br> so just hang out with Tyler<br> and I'll be<br> right back down.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> So, how old are you?<br> Do you watch movies?<br> Are you afraid of dying?<br> Hmm?<br> Are you afraid of dying?<br> Um...<br> I don't know.<br> I mean,<br> I guess everybody is.<br> I don't know. Why?<br> Because my mom is<br> going to kill you.<br> You're making me<br> uncomfortable.<br> Your hair looks burned.<br> Okay.<br> Are you going to make<br> a baby with my father?<br> I don't...<br> I don't know.<br> My grandma died<br> where you're sitting.<br> She died right here?<br> Right where your<br> underpants are.<br> You wanna<br> watch me dance?<br> Sure.<br> I can't do this.<br> Listen to me.<br> I miss you so much.<br> I'll come over right now.<br> Okay, I'm not over<br> you yet, that's why.<br> She's not even pretty.<br> I'm not doing it.<br> I can't.

Oh, boy.<br> You know what?<br> Something's going<br> to happen to you.<br> I don't know what it is,<br> but something's<br> going to happen<br> to your body.<br> That was fun.<br> Oh, my gosh.<br> You know what I was thinking?<br> You should come with me<br> to Lillian's wedding, maybe.<br> Not like that.<br> Not like anything serious.<br> But just like<br> a fun time, you know?<br> We can get dressed up,<br> and we can go<br> dancing and have a drink.<br> It'll be fun, right?<br> No. I mean,<br> I don't want to make<br> you have to explain<br> to all those people<br> what our relationship is.<br> That would suck for you.<br> Right?<br> Yeah. I guess so.<br> I'm just thinking of you.<br> Yeah.<br> No, it's okay.<br> I have someone else<br> I can ask, anyway. So...<br> Really?<br> Yeah.<br> Who?<br> Umm...<br> This guy, George.<br> George Glass.<br> Okay.<br> Who is this George?<br> He is a very hot, nice guy<br> who likes me a lot,<br> and would probably<br> love to be my date.<br> Really?<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Well, let me ask you this.<br> Can this George Glass<br> do this to you?<br> Probably.<br> You know what?<br> It's getting really late.<br> You should probably go.<br> I'm going to miss you so much.<br> Oh.<br> Annie Walker.<br> Hi.<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> What brings you<br> in here so early?<br> I've just had a bad night.<br> Boy stuff.<br> Ohh.<br> Do you want me<br> to arrest anybody?<br> I could do that.<br> Actually... No.<br> Do you want to talk<br> to a cop about it?<br> We are just like priests.<br> Except we can<br> tell everybody<br> about it after wards.<br> Oh.<br> I won't, though.<br> Doesn't sound very inviting.<br> You want a carrot?<br> Right now?<br> Yeah.<br> I'll share.<br> I've got plenty.<br> Sure, I'll have a carrot.<br> Yeah?<br> Okay.<br> Ohh. Yeah,<br> that sounds rough.<br> It's going to<br> get better, right?<br> I wouldn't have<br> thought so.<br> You know, my sister<br> was a maid of honor<br> at our cousin's wedding,<br> and she found it so stressful,<br> her hair started falling out.<br> That's terrible.<br> Yeah.<br> It grew back,<br> but it was...<br> It was pretty gross.<br> Planning a wedding<br> should be fun.<br> You know what?<br> If I ever had a wedding,<br> I'd want everybody<br> to be stress-free.<br> I'd like it to be<br> like a carnival.<br> Like, people win prizes<br> for guessing<br> the bride's weight.<br> Dunk tanks.<br> Yeah.<br> You know?<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> You could have elephants,<br> and the bride and groom<br> can walk on<br> a little tightrope.<br> Okay, what you are<br> talking about there,<br> that's a circus wedding.<br> It's a totally different...<br> Right.<br> You missed it.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, you know,<br> instead of stressing<br> out about this wedding,<br> you know what you<br> should be doing?<br> Setting up a new bakery!<br> Hmm.<br> No, I'm kind of<br> done with that.<br> What?<br> I don't do it any more.<br> All right.<br> Ew.<br> Oh!<br> You got the ugly carrot.<br> What?<br> There is one in every bag.<br> You have to eat it.<br> It's good luck.<br> I'm not eating this.<br> Yeah! I'll eat it.<br> It's the lucky carrot?<br> No, don't eat it!<br> Don't eat it. Don't eat it!<br> Well, don't litter!<br> I'll fine you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You know what?<br> Actually,<br> I'm going to pick it up.<br> It really bothers me.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's just that I'm anal<br> about that kind of thing.<br> I didn't know that<br> you could be a cop here<br> if you weren't a citizen.<br> You can't.<br> No?<br> No. No, you can't.<br> But they made<br> a special dispensation<br> because I'm so<br> tough and strong.<br> Oh.

Yay!<br> Excuse me.<br> Oh. Hi.<br> I'm looking for a birthday<br> gift for my best friend.<br> Oh.<br> I want to get her<br> a necklace that says,<br> "Best Friends Forever."<br> You sure you want<br> it to say "Forever"?<br> Yeah, why?<br> Come on. "Forever"?<br> Forever.<br> I don't think you guys<br> will be best friends forever.<br> No offense.<br> But you know...<br> The friends you have<br> when you are<br> younger sometimes...<br> Sometimes you grow apart<br> when you get older.<br> Maybe she'll find<br> a new best friend.<br> And maybe she<br> will be more<br> successful than you are<br> and prettier and<br> richer and skinnier<br> and they end up doing<br> everything together.<br> You are weird.<br> I'm not weird. Okay?<br> Yes, you are.<br> No, I'm not,<br> and you started it.<br> No, you started it.<br> Did you forget<br> to take your Xanax<br> this morning?<br> God, I feel bad<br> for your parents.<br> I feel bad for your face.<br> Okay, well,<br> call me when<br> your boobs come in.<br> You call me<br> when yours come in.<br> What, do you have<br> four boyfriends?<br> Exactly.<br> Yeah, okay, have fun<br> having a baby at your prom.<br> You look like an old mop.<br> You know what?<br> You're not as popular<br> as you think you are.<br> I am very popular.<br> I'm sure you are.<br> Very popular.<br> Well, you're an old,<br> single loser<br> who is never going<br> to have any friends.<br> You're a little cunt.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Let me tell my mom, okay.<br> I already told her.<br> Was she mad?<br> Hi, Annie,<br> it's Rhodes again.<br> Since you're not<br> returning any of my calls,<br> I assume that<br> you're not interested<br> in spending any<br> more time with me,<br> which is fine.<br> So don't worry,<br> I won't be bothering<br> you ever again.<br> Get those taillights fixed.<br> We'd like to invite you<br> to no longer live<br> with us any more.<br> What? What do you mean?<br> I don't get it.<br> The thing is,<br> we decided that it was<br> actually a bit immature<br> for a grown-up<br> brother and sister to<br> still be living<br> together with a roommate.<br> At our age, it's a bit<br> ridiculous, isn't it?<br> Yeah.<br> We look a bit silly,<br> don't we?<br> Pathetic.<br> So we are actually<br> going to live together alone.<br> Without you.<br> You're moving out.<br> She's not moving.<br> She will move.<br> Eventually.<br> Eventually.<br> She has to.<br> She is taking it in.<br> You have to leave.<br> Oh!

Tom Hanks.<br> It's like Forrest Gump,<br> but on an island.<br> Honey, you are gonna love it.<br> My God.<br> This is her driveway?<br> Who is that man?<br> Are you a guest of<br> Helen Harris III?<br> Yes. Technically. I guess.<br> An attendant will<br> meet you at the stables.<br> Where?<br> The shower is over<br> the second bridge.<br> Pink lemonade?<br> Thank you.<br> I don't have a cup holder.<br> Can I just give that...<br> Pink lemonade.<br> Nice. Nice touch.<br> Shit.<br> God damn it, that's good.<br> Mmm.<br> Shit, that is fresh.<br> This is the most<br> beautiful shower<br> I have ever been to.<br> Yes, and Helen<br> is giving out the<br> cutest party favors.<br> I know,<br> I love their pink berets.<br> Would you like<br> some champagne?<br> Yes.<br> It's French.<br> Annie. Hey.<br> Hi.<br> How are you doing?<br> You're here.<br> Yeah, I'm here.<br> I was invited.

Lesbian.<br> We're all thinking it,<br> aren't we?<br> I'm not.<br> Okay? Yes, we're all<br> thinking it, right?<br> I was.<br> Annie...<br> Lillian, this is not<br> the "you" that I know.<br> The "you" that I<br> know would have<br> walked in here<br> and rolled your eyes<br> and thought<br> this was completely<br> over-the-top,<br> ridiculous and stupid.<br> Look at this shower!<br> Look at that fucking cookie!<br> Did you really think<br> that this group of women<br> was going to<br> finish that cookie?<br> Really? You know what?<br> That reminds me, actually.<br> I never got a chance<br> to try that fucking cookie!<br> Stupid fucking cookie!<br> Delicious! Stupid cookie.<br> I think I'll...<br> Maybe it's better if I<br> dip it in the chocolate.<br> is this what<br> you want, Lillian?<br> This is so awesome.<br> All right,<br> let's have some nice,<br> hot, unsanitary chocolate!<br> Ahh! It's hot!<br> Jesus! God!<br> Christ, Annie.<br> Have you lost<br> your fucking mind?<br> What are you doing?<br> What am I doing?<br> You wouldn't know,<br> would you?<br> Where have you been?<br> You would have no idea.<br> Let me fill you in, okay?<br> Ever since you got engaged,<br> everything has turned to shit!<br> You know what?<br> This is supposed<br> to be about my time!<br> You have managed<br> to ruin every event<br> in my wedding.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Okay, well,<br> thank you very much.<br> It's all her fault.<br> It is not mine!<br> And you would know that,<br> if you got your<br> beautiful haired head<br> out of your asshole.<br> In fact, out of her asshole,<br> which I'm sure is<br> perfectly bleached.<br> You know what? It is!<br> And you know how I know?<br> Because I went to<br> the fucking salon with her<br> and I got my<br> asshole bleached, too!<br> And I love my new asshole!<br> You know what?<br> Why can't you<br> just be happy for me<br> and then go home and<br> talk behind my back later,<br> like a normal person?<br> I am happy for you, Lillian.<br> I am very happy for you.<br> I wish you well.<br> I won't bother<br> you any more.<br> Are you kidding me? Annie!<br> Go, go, go, go, go!<br> Get back here! Stop.<br> No, no! She does<br> not get a party favor.<br> She does not get a dog!<br> And if you are<br> going to act like this,<br> then don't even bother<br> coming to my wedding!<br> I'm proud of you, Lil.<br> Shut up, Helen!<br> Anybody else have anything<br> they want to share today?<br> I took two dogs already.<br> They're in the back of my van.<br> What?<br> What? Where are you going?<br> Hit and run! Classy!<br> Perfect! Okay.<br> I'm gonna find you!<br> I'm coming!<br> Come on! Come on! Come on.<br> No!<br> Shit.<br> I can't say<br> I'm surprised.<br> I did tell you to<br> get your lights fixed.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> And now here we are.<br> Look, I have<br> had a horrible day.<br> I don't need a lecture<br> from you right now, okay?<br> I just... Helen just...<br> Oh! Don't...<br> This didn't happen<br> because of Helen.<br> This happened<br> because you didn't get<br> your taillights fixed.<br> It's pretty simple.<br> Do you have any idea<br> how frustrating it is<br> to see you,<br> night by night,<br> drive past me<br> with your fucking<br> taillights still broken?<br> Do you have any idea<br> how crazy that makes me?<br> It's a simple solution!<br> Your problem, Annie,<br> is that you just<br> don't understand<br> that you can hurt people<br> with these broken lights.<br> Don't you see how<br> irresponsible this is?<br> Yes, I should have<br> gotten my fucking<br> taillights fixed.<br> But I didn't, okay?<br> I didn't.<br> Listen,<br> don't worry about it.<br> Seriously.<br> Your message<br> was received.<br> No, look, please,<br> I don't know what's<br> going on with me right now.<br> Look, it's fine. Don't bother.<br> Really, what's done is done.<br> That's it?<br> Where are you going?<br> That's it! That's it.<br> That's how this works.<br> Come on. I didn't...<br> For the record, Annie,<br> you flirted with me.<br> You made me feel like<br> you really liked me,<br> which was really unfair.<br> And then you came home with me<br> and we did stuff, fun stuff,<br> and then you just left,<br> just like it was nothing.<br> Oh, please. I know<br> how guys do this thing.<br> I know how guys act.<br> One minute,<br> it means something.<br> The next minute, it doesn't.<br> Right, yeah, you've<br> got it all figured out.<br> Yeah.<br> How is that<br> working out for you?<br> Pretty good?<br> Boom!<br> What's up, fuck-buddy?<br> You call for some<br> roadside assistance?<br> Thanks, officer.<br> I can handle it<br> from here on out.<br> Come on!<br> I didn't have<br> anyone else to call!<br> I didn't know that<br> you were gonna show up!<br> That's the problem<br> with cops, Annie.<br> We're just never<br> there when you need us.<br> That cop talks weird.<br> - Come on, dingus.<br> Tick-tock. I got shit to do.<br> Check it out.<br> Look what's steering the car.<br> Thanks again<br> for picking me up.<br> Not a problem.<br> Were you busy?<br> Well, it is Friday.<br> You know,<br> you look tired.<br> If you're tired,<br> you can totally<br> lay down in my lap,<br> if you want.<br> What?<br> Just take a little lap-nap.<br> If you want.<br> Open for biz.<br> Okay, can you just pull over?<br> Yeah, actually,<br> that's an even better idea.<br> No, no, no, can you<br> please just stop the car?<br> I want to get out.<br> No, it's super gravelly.<br> Please pull over!<br> Why?<br> Because I would rather<br> get murdered out here<br> than spend the next<br> half-an-hour with you.<br> Can you please<br> just pull over?<br> Come on, Annie.<br> It's called humor.<br> Learn about it.<br> Besides, I would<br> never last a half-hour.<br> Good bye, Ted.<br> If you're trying to<br> turn me on, it's working.<br> You used me!<br> No big deal.<br> You are no longer<br> my number three!<br> Wilson!<br> Wilson! I'm sorry!<br> I'm sorry, Wilson.<br> Wilson, I'm sorry!<br> I'm sorry!<br> Oh, no, Wilson.<br> Wilson!<br> I'm coming in.<br> Let's go, let's go.<br> And we're walking.<br> Okay, we're walking.<br> Heel. Heel!<br> No pee. No!<br> Not on the carpet!<br> Okay, we're coming...<br> We're coming in.<br> Everybody is in<br> and having fun.<br> We're having fun.<br> And heel! We're heeling.<br> Heel!<br> How many of<br> those did you take?<br> I took nine.<br> Yeah, I did<br> slightly over-commit<br> to the whole dog thing.<br> It turns out, I'm probably<br> more comfortable with six.<br> It's a lot...
