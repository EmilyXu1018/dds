who is this?<br> Him, we do not know,<br> It may be what you said it is,<br> Attorney General's friend,<br> Just a guy that RDA<br> He recruited to take care of it,<br> It seems that the East Germans<br> They are fighting for a place at our table,<br> The RDA Abel returns to the Russians,<br> earning their respect<br> and grabbed the headlines for their cause,<br> Which, of course,<br> East Germany places on the map,<br> But do not care to map them,<br> Stay with the Russians,<br> Stay with the Russians,<br> Is Powers for Abel,<br> So all this means<br> that can actually happen?<br> Yes, it's what you<br> seems to be telling me,<br> Abel put on a plane,<br> it will arrive on Friday,<br> So if Schischkin have the green light,<br> there will remain only the details of the negotiation,<br> Replacing our face by them,<br> Our "guys", Two guys, Powers and Pryor,<br> No, do not give me<br> with cheap sentimentality,<br> It's just the Powers that matters,<br> Forget about playboy<br> who obviously found a good idea<br> studying the Soviet economy in Berlin<br> in the middle of the Cold War,<br> It's the Powers that we need,<br> You do not like Powers,<br> Everyone

spy,<br> that is no threat to you,<br> And in return for that person<br> worthless to you,<br> you play an equal role<br> the exchange between the Russians and the Americans,<br> And this is a negotiation<br> between us and you two,<br> We do not try to do two things,<br> We're only doing one,<br> A one a,<br> It's hard for me to see as the Republic<br> East Germany is overlooked,<br> He
