                        Evening, Mr. Godby.<br> - Hello, hello, hello.<br> - Quite the stranger, aren't you?<br> - I couldn't get in yesterday.<br> - I wondered what had happened to you.<br> - I had a bit of a dustup.<br> - What about?<br> Saw a chap getting out<br> of a frst-class compartment.<br> When he came to give up his ticket,<br> it was only third class.<br> I told him to pay the excess,<br> and he turned nasty.<br> - I had to send for Mr. Saunders.<br> - Fat lot of good he'd be.<br> - He ticked him off.<br> - Seeing's believing.<br> I tell you,<br> he ticked him off proper.<br> "You pay the balance at once,<br> or I'll hand you over to the police. "<br> You ought to have seen the chap's face<br> at the mention of the word "police."<br> Changed his tune.<br> Then he paid up like lightning.<br> That's what I mean. He didn't have<br> the courage to handle it himself.<br> - He had to call in the police.<br> - Aw, he's not a bad lot, Mr. Saunders.<br> You can't expect much spirit from a man<br> with one lung and a wife with diabetes.<br> I thought something must be wrong<br> when you didn't come.<br> - I would've popped in to explain,<br> but I had a date and had to run.<br> - Indeed.<br> - Chap I know is getting married.<br> - Very interesting, I'm sure.<br> - What's up with you, anyway?<br> - I'm sure I don't know<br> to what you're referring.<br> - You're a bit unfriendly<br> all of a sudden.<br> - Beryl, hurry up.<br> Put some more coal in the stove<br> while you're at it.<br> I'm afraid I can't really<br> stand here wasting my time<br> in idle gossip, Mr. Godby.<br> - Aren't you going<br> to offer me another cup?<br> - When you've fnished that one.<br> Beryl'll give it to you.<br> I've got my accounts to do.<br> I see.<br> I'd rather you gave it to me.<br> Time and tide wait for no man,<br> Mr. Godby.<br> - Laura, what a lovely surprise!<br> - Oh, Dolly.<br> My dear, I've been shopping<br> till I'm dropping.<br> My feet are nearly off,<br> my throat's parched.<br> I thought of having tea in Spindle's,<br> but I was terrifed of losing the train.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - This is Dr. Harvey.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Would you be a perfect dear<br> and get me my cup of tea?<br> I really don't think I could drag<br> my poor old bones over to the counter.<br> No, please.<br> Dear, what a nice-looking man.<br> Who on earth is he?<br> You're quite a dark horse.<br> I shall telephone Fred in<br> the morning and make mischief.<br> This is a bit of luck.<br> I haven't seen you for ages.<br> I've been meaning to pop in,<br> but Tony's had measles and I had<br> all that fuss over Phyllis.<br> - But, of course, you don't know.<br> My dear, she left me.<br> - Oh, how dreadful.<br> Mind you, I never cared for her much,<br> but Tony adored her.<br> I'll tell you all about that later<br> in the train. Thank you so very much.<br> There's certainly enough milk in it,<br> but still, it'll be refreshing.<br> - Oh, dear, no sugar.<br> - It's in the spoon.<br> Oh, of course.<br> What a fool I am.<br> Laura, you're looking<br> frightfully well. I wish I'd<br> known you were coming in today.<br> We could've come together<br> and lunched and had a good gossip.<br> I loathe shopping<br> by myself anyway.<br> - There's your train.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - Aren't you coming with us?<br> - I go in the opposite direction.<br> My practice is in Churley.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - I'm a general practitioner.<br> - Dr. Harvey's going out<br> to Africa next week.<br> - Oh, how thrilling.<br> ... the 5:40<br> to Churley, Leigh Green and Langdon.<br> - I must go.<br> - Yes, you must.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> He'll have to run, or he'll miss it.<br> He's got to get over to the platform.<br> Talking of missing trains reminds me of<br> that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.<br> You've got to go traipsing all up one<br> side along the top and down the other.<br> - Well, the other day, I'd been<br> over about renewing the lease.<br> - Train Engine Chugging]<br> I arrived at the station at<br> exactly half a minute to spare.<br> My dear, I flew.<br> I'd got Tony with me,<br> and like a fool, I just bought a new<br> shade for the lamp in the drawing room.<br> I could've gotten it<br> just as easily here in Milford.<br> Well, it was the most enormous thing.<br> I could hardly see over it.<br> I've never been in such a hurry in<br> my life. I nearly knocked a woman down.<br> By the time I got home,<br> it was battered to bits.<br> - Oh, is that our train?<br> Is that the Ketchworth train?<br> - No, it's the express.<br> - The boat train.<br> Oh, of course. That doesn't stop,<br> does it? I want some chocolate, please.<br> - Milk or plain?<br> - Plain, I think.<br> Or, no, perhaps milk would be nicer.<br> Have you any with nuts?<br> Nestle's Nut Milk.<br> Shilling or sixpence?<br> I'll take one plain<br> and one nut milk.<br> - Large or small?<br> - Large, please.<br> Oh.<br> Where is she?<br> I never noticed her go.<br> Oh, I couldn't think<br> where you'd disappeared to.<br> I just wanted to see<br> the express go through.<br> What on earth's the matter?<br> Are you feeling ill?<br> - I feel a little sick.<br> - My dear, come and sit down.<br> - Bell Ringing]<br> - There's our train.<br> - It's all right.<br> Have you any brandy?<br> - I'm afraid it's out of hours.<br> - Oh, surely,<br> if somebody's feeling ill...<br> - I'm all right, really.<br> - Just a sip of brandy<br> will buck you up. Please.<br> - Very well.<br> - Thank you. How much?<br> - Tenpence, please.<br> The train for Ketchworth is now<br> arriving at platform three.<br> We shall have to hurry.<br> Oh, well, this is a bit of luck.<br> This train's generally packed.<br> I really am very worried about you,<br> dear. You look terribly peaky.<br> I'm all right. Really, I am. I just<br> felt faint for a minute, that's all.<br> It often happens to me. I did it once<br> in the middle of Bobby's school concert.<br> I don't think he's ever forgiven me.<br> - Well, he certainly was<br> very good-looking.<br> - Who?<br> Your friend, Doctor...<br> whatever his name was.<br> - Yes, he's a nice creature.<br> - Have you known him long?<br> No, not very long.<br> I hardly know him at all, really.<br> Well, my dear, I've always had<br> a passion for doctors.<br> I can well understand how it is<br> that women get...<br> I wish I could trust you.<br> I wish you were a wise,<br> kind friend,<br> instead of a gossiping acquaintance<br> I've known casually for years...<br> and never<br> particularly cared for.<br> I wish. I wish.<br> - Fancy him going all the way<br> to Africa. Is he married?<br> - Yes.<br> - Any children?<br> - Yes, two boys.<br> He's very proud of them.<br> - Is he taking them with him,<br> his wife and children, I mean?<br> - Yes, he is.<br> I suppose it's sensible in a way<br> rushing off to start life anew<br> in the wide open spaces,<br> but wild horses wouldn't<br> drag me away from England...<br> and home and all the things<br> I'm used to.<br> - One has one's roots<br> after all, hasn't one?<br> - Oh, yes, one has one's roots.<br> I knew a girl once years ago<br> who went to Africa.<br> Her husband was something<br> to do with engineering.<br> She had the most dreadful time.<br> She caught some awful germ<br> through going out on a picnic,<br> and she was ill for months.<br> I wish you'd stop talking.<br> I wish you'd stop prying,<br> trying to find things out.<br> I wish she were dead.<br> No, I don't mean that.<br> That was silly and unkind,<br> but I wish you'd stop talking.<br> My dear, all her hair came out, and she<br> said the social life was quite horrid.<br> - Provincial, you know.<br> Very nouveau riche.<br> - Oh, Dolly.<br> - What's the matter,<br> are you feeling ill again?<br> - No, I feel a bit dizzy.<br> - I think I'll close my eyes<br> for a little.<br> - Oh, you poor darling.<br> And here am I chattering away 19<br> to the dozen. I won't say another word.<br> If you drop off, I'll wake you<br> when we get to the level crossing.<br> That'll give you a chance to pull<br> yourself together and powder your nose.<br> Thanks, Dolly.<br> This can't last.<br> This misery can't last.<br> I must remember that<br> and try to control myself.<br> Nothing lasts, really...<br> neither happiness nor despair.<br> Not even life lasts very long.<br> There'll come a time in the future<br> when I shan't mind about this anymore,<br> when I can look back and say<br> quite peacefully and cheerfully<br> how silly I was.<br> No, no, I don't want<br> that time to come ever.<br> I want to remember<br> every minute...<br> always...<br> always to the end of my days.<br> Ketchworth!<br> - Wake up, Laura. We're here.<br> - Ketchworth!<br> I could easily come<br> to the house with you, dear.<br> It isn't very much out of my way.<br> Thank you. All I have to do is walk down<br> Elmore Lane, past the grammar school.<br> It's sweet of you, Dolly, but I'm<br> perfectly all right now, really I am.<br> - You're quite sure?<br> - Absolutely positive.<br> Thank you for being so kind.<br> Oh, nonsense, dear.<br> I shall telephone in the morning<br> and see if you've had a relapse.<br> I shall disappoint you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night. Oh, give my love<br> to Fred and the children.<br> - Is that you, Laura?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> Thank goodness you've come back.<br> The place has been in an uproar.<br> - Why? What's the matter?<br> - Bobby and Margaret<br> have been fighting again.<br> They won't go to sleep until you go in<br> and talk to them about it.<br> - Mummy? Is that you, Mummy?<br> - Yes, Margaret.<br> Come upstairs at once, Mummy!<br> I want to talk to you.<br> You're both very naughty. You should<br> have been asleep hours ago. What is it?<br> Well, Mummy, tomorrow's my birthday,<br> and I want to go to the circus.<br> And tomorrow's not Margaret's birthday,<br> and she wants to go to the pantomime.<br> My birthday's in June.<br> There aren't any pantomimes in June.<br> It's far too late<br> to discuss it tonight,<br> and if you don't go to sleep, I shall<br> tell Daddy not to let you go to either.<br> Oh, Mummy!<br> Why not take them to both? One<br> in the afternoon, one in the evening?<br> You know that's impossible. We shouldn't<br> get them to bed till all hours,<br> and they'd be tired<br> and fractious.<br> Well, then, one on one day<br> and the other on the other.<br> You're always accusing me<br> of spoiling the children.<br> Their characters would be ruined<br> in a fortnight if I left them<br> to your over-tender mercies.<br> All right, have it<br> your own way.<br> - Circus or pantomime?<br> - Neither.<br> We'll thrash them both soundly,<br> lock them up in the attic...<br> and go to the pictures<br> by ourselves.<br> Oh, Fred.<br> - What on earth's the matter?<br> - Nothing. It's nothing.<br> Darling, what's wrong?<br> - Tell me, please.<br> - Really and truly, it's nothing.<br> I'm just a little rundown,<br> that's all.<br> I had a sort of fainting spell<br> at the refreshment room at Milford.<br> Isn't it idiotic?<br> Dolly Messiter was with me,<br> and she talked and talked and talked<br> until I wanted to strangle her.<br> Still, she meant to be kind.<br> Isn't it awful about people<br> meaning to be kind?<br> - Would you like to go to bed?<br> - No, Fred, really.<br> Come and sit by the fre<br> in the library and relax.<br> You can help me<br> with the Times crossword.<br> - You have the most<br> peculiar ideas of relaxation.<br> - That's better.<br> - There you are, darling.<br> - Thank you.<br> But why a fainting spell?<br> I can't understand it.<br> Don't be silly, darling. I've often<br> had fainting spells, and you know it.<br> Don't you remember Bobby's<br> school concert and Eileen's wedding...<br> and that time you insisted<br> on taking me to that symphony<br> concert at the town hall?<br> Go on, that was a nosebleed.<br> I suppose I must be that type of woman.<br> It's very humiliating.<br> I still maintain there'd be no harm<br> in you seeing Dr. Graves.<br> - It would be a waste of time.<br> - Now, listen...<br> Do shut up about it, darling.<br> You're making a fuss about nothing.<br> I'd been shopping and was tired.<br> The refreshment room was hot,<br> and I suddenly felt sick.<br> - Nothing more than that.<br> - All right.<br> Really nothing more than that.<br> Now you get on with your puzzle<br> and leave me in peace.<br> Have it your own way.<br> You're a poetry addict. See if you can<br> help me over this. It's Keats.<br> "When I behold<br> upon the night starred face...<br> huge cloudy symbols of a high"...<br> something in seven letters.<br> Romance, I think.<br> I'm almost sure it is.<br> "Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance."<br> It'll be in the Oxford Book of Verse.<br> No, that's right, I'm sure,<br> because it fts in with<br> "delirium" and "Baluchistan."<br> - Would some music<br> throw you off your stride?<br> - No, dear, I'd like it.<br> Fred.<br> Fred,<br> dear Fred.<br> There's so much<br> that I want to say to you.<br> You're the only one in the world<br> with enough wisdom<br> and gentleness to understand.<br> If only it were<br> somebody else's story and not mine.<br> As it is, you are the only one<br> in the world that I can never tell.<br> Never, never.<br> Because even if I waited until we were<br> old, old people and told you then,<br> you'd be bound to look back<br> over the years and be hurt,<br> and, oh, my dear,<br> I don't want you to be hurt.<br> You see, we are<br> a happily married couple...<br> and must never forget that.<br> This is my home.<br> You are my husband,<br> and my children<br> are upstairs in bed.<br> I am a happily married woman...<br> or, rather, I was<br> until a few weeks ago.<br> This is my whole world,<br> and it's enough...<br> or, rather, it was,<br> until a few weeks ago.<br> But, oh, Fred,<br> I've been so foolish.<br> I've fallen in love.<br> I'm an ordinary woman.<br> I didn't think such violent things<br> could happen to ordinary people.<br> It all started<br> on an ordinary day,<br> in the most ordinary place<br> in the world,<br> the refreshment room<br> at Milford Junction.<br> I was having a cup of tea...<br> and reading a book that I'd got<br> that morning from Boots.<br> My train wasn't due<br> for ten minutes.<br> I looked up and saw a man<br> come in from the platform.<br> He had on an ordinary mac.<br> His hat was turned down,<br> and I didn't even see his face.<br> He got his tea at the counter<br> and turned.<br> Then I did see his face.<br> It was rather a nice face.<br> - Any sugar? Thank you.<br> - In the spoon.<br> - He passed my table on the way to his.<br> - You're neglecting your duty.<br> The woman at the counter<br> was going on as usual.<br> You know, I told you about her the other<br> day... the one with the refined voice.<br> - Minnie hasn't touched her milk.<br> - Did you put it down for her?<br> Yes, but she never came for it.<br> - Fond of animals?<br> - In their place.<br> My landlady's got<br> a positive mania for animals.<br> She's got two cats...<br> one Manx, one ordinary...<br> three rabbits in a hutch<br> in the kitchen... they belong<br> to her little boy by rights...<br> and one of those dark-looking dogs<br> with hair over its eyes.<br> I don't know<br> to what breed you refer.<br> I don't think it knows itself.<br> - Go and clean off number three,<br> I can see crumbs from here.<br> What about my other cup?<br> I'll have to be moving.<br> The 5:40 will be in in a minute.<br> - Who's on the gate?<br> - Young William.<br> Please, a glass of water.<br> I've got something in my eye,<br> and I want to bathe it.<br> - Would you like me to look?<br> - Oh, no, don't trouble.<br> I expect the water will do.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Bit of coal dust, I expect.<br> A man I knew lost the sight in one eye<br> through getting a bit of grit in it.<br> - Nasty, very nasty.<br> - Better?<br> - I'm afraid not. Ooh.<br> - Can I help you?<br> Oh, no, please,<br> it's only something in my eye.<br> - Try pulling your eyelid down<br> as far as it'll go.<br> - And then blowing your nose.<br> - Please let me look.<br> I happen to be a doctor.<br> - It's very kind of you.<br> Turn around<br> to the light, please.<br> Now look up.<br> Now look down.<br> Keep still. I see it.<br> - There.<br> - Oh, what a relief. It was agonizing.<br> - It looks like a bit of grit.<br> - The express went through.<br> Thank you very much, indeed.<br> - There we go. I must run.<br> - How lucky for me<br> you happened to be here.<br> - Anybody could've done it.<br> - Never mind, you did,<br> and I'm most grateful.<br> - There's my train. I must go. Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> That's how it all began...<br> just through me getting<br> a little piece of grit in my eye.<br> I completely forgot the whole incident.<br> It didn't mean anything to me at all...<br> at least<br> I didn't think it did.<br> The next Thursday I went<br> into Milford again, as usual.<br> I changed my book at Boots.<br> Miss Lewis had at last managed<br> to get the new Kate O'Brien for me.<br> I believe she'd kept it hidden<br> under the counter for two days.<br> On the way out, I bought<br> two new toothbrushes for the children.<br> I like the smell of a chemist's<br> better than any other shop.<br> It's such a mixture of nice things...<br> herbs and scent and soap.<br> That awful Mrs. Leftwich<br> was at the other end of the counter...<br> wearing one of the silliest hats<br> I've ever seen.<br> Wearing one of the silliest hats<br> I've ever seen.<br> Fortunately, she didn't look up, so<br> I got out without her buttonholing me.<br> Just as I stepped out<br> onto the pavement...<br> - Good morning. How's the eye?<br> - Oh, Good morning.<br> Perfectly all right. How kind it was<br> of you to take so much trouble.<br> - It was nothing at all.<br> It's clearing up I think.<br> - Yes, it's going to be nice.<br> - Well, I must be getting along<br> to the hospital.<br> - And I to the grocers.<br> - What exciting lives we lead,<br> don't we? Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> That evening I had to<br> run nearly all the way to the station.<br> I'd been to the Palladium, as usual,<br> but it was a terribly long film.<br> I was afraid I'd be late.<br> As I came up onto the platform,<br> the Churley train was just puffing out.<br> I looked up idly as the windows<br> of the carriages went by,<br> wondering if he was there.<br> I remember this crossing my mind<br> but it was quite unimportant.<br> I was really thinking<br> of other things.<br> The present for your birthday<br> was worrying me rather.<br> It was terribly expensive,<br> but I knew you wanted it,<br> and I sort of half taken the plunge<br> and left a deposit on it...<br> at Spink and Robson's<br> until the next Thursday,<br> the next Thursday.<br> Well, I squared my conscience<br> by thinking how pleased<br> you would be and bought it.<br> - Yes, I'll have it.<br> - Thank you, madam.<br> It was wildly extravagant,<br> I know, but having committed the crime,<br> I suddenly felt<br> reckless and gay.<br> The sun was out, and everybody in the<br> street looked more cheerful than usual,<br> and there was a barrel organ<br> at the corner by Harris's,<br> and you know how I love<br> barrel organs.<br> It was playing<br> "Let the Great Big World Keep Turning,"<br> and I gave the man sixpence<br> and went to the Kardomah for lunch.<br> It was very full, but two people had got<br> up from the tablejust as I had come in.<br> That was a bit of luck,<br> wasn't it? Or was it?<br> Just after I had given my order,<br> I saw him come in.<br> He looked a little tired, I thought,<br> and there was nowhere for him to sit,<br> - so I smiled and said...<br> - Good morning.<br> - Oh, good morning. Are you all alone?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> - Would you mind if I shared your table?<br> It's very full.<br> - No, of course not.<br> I'm afraid we haven't been introduced<br> properly. My name's Alec Harvey.<br> How do you do?<br> Mine's Laura Jesson.<br> - Mrs. Or Miss?<br> - Mrs.<br> - You're a doctor, aren't you?<br> I remember you said so that day<br> in the refreshment room.<br> - Yes.<br> Not a very interesting one. Just an<br> ordinary G.P. My practice is in Churley.<br> - Yes, sir? Excuse me, sir?<br> - What did you plump for?<br> Um, the soup and fried sole.<br> - Yes, I'll have the same.<br> - Anything to drink?<br> No, thank you. That is,<br> would you like anything to drink?<br> - No, thank you. Just plain water.<br> - Plain water, please.<br> Will you just look<br> at the cellist?<br> It really is dreadful, isn't it?<br> But we oughtn't laugh.<br> They might see.<br> There should be a society<br> for the prevention of cruelty<br> to musical instruments.<br> - You don't play the piano, I hope?<br> - I was forced to as a child.<br> - You haven't kept it up?<br> - No, my husband isn't musical at all.<br> - Good for him.<br> - For all you know, I might have<br> a tremendous burning talent.<br> - Oh, dear, no.<br> - Why are you so sure?<br> You're too sane<br> and uncomplicated.<br> I suppose it's a good thing<br> to be uncomplicated<br> but it does sound a little dull.<br> You could never be dull.<br> - Do you come here every Thursday?<br> - Yes, to spend a day at hospital.<br> Stephen Lynn, the chief physician here<br> graduated with me.<br> I take over from him once a week.<br> Gives him a chance to go to London.<br> - Gives me a chance<br> to study the hospital patients.<br> - I see.<br> - Do you?<br> - Do I what?<br> - Come here every Thursday?<br> - Yes, I do the week's shopping.<br> Thank you.<br> Change my library book, have lunch<br> and generally go to the pictures.<br> Not a very exciting routine,<br> but it makes a change.<br> - Are you going to the pictures<br> this afternoon?<br> - Yes.<br> How extraordinary.<br> So am I.<br> I thought you had to spend<br> all day at the hospital.<br> Well, between ourselves, I killed<br> two patients by accident this morning.<br> The matron's very displeased with me.<br> I simply daren't go back.<br> - How can you be so silly?<br> - Seriously, I did get through<br> most of my work this morning.<br> It won't matter at all if I play truant.<br> Would you mind if I came with you?<br> - Well, l...<br> - I could sit downstairs,<br> and you could sit upstairs.<br> Upstairs is too expensive.<br> The orchestra stopped<br> as abruptly as it had started,<br> and we began to laugh again.<br> I had no premonitions,<br> although I suppose I should have had.<br> It all seemed so natural<br> and so innocent.<br> We finished lunch, and that idiot of<br> a waitress had put the bill all on one.<br> - I really must insist.<br> - I couldn't possibly.<br> Having forced my company on you,<br> it's only fair I pay.<br> Please, don't insist.<br> I should so much rather we halved it.<br> - I would really, please.<br> - I shall give in gracefully.<br> We halved it meticulously.<br> We even halved the tip.<br> Thank you.<br> We have two choices: The Loves<br> of Cardinal Richelieu at the Palace...<br> - or Love in a Mist at the Palladium.<br> - You're very knowledgeable.<br> There must be no argument about buying<br> the tickets. We each pay for ourselves.<br> You must think me a poor doctor<br> if I can't afford a couple<br> of one-and-ninepennies.<br> - I insist.<br> - I hoped you were going to treat me.<br> - Which is it: Palace or Palladium?<br> - Palladium.<br> I was once very sick on a channel<br> steamer called Cardinal Richelieu.<br> Excuse me.<br> I feel awfully grand perched up here.<br> It was very extravagant of you.<br> - It was a famous victory.<br> - Do you feel guilty as all? I do.<br> - Guilty?<br> - You ought to more than me.<br> You neglected your work.<br> I worked this morning. A little<br> relaxation never did harm to anyone.<br> Why should either of us<br> feel guilty?<br> - I don't know.<br> - How awfully nice you are.<br> It can't be.<br> It is.<br> We walked back<br> to the station together.<br> Just as we reached the gates,<br> he put his hand under my arm.<br> I didn't notice it then,<br> but I remember it now.<br> - What's she like... your wife?<br> - Madeleine?<br> Small, dark,<br> rather delicate.<br> How funny. I should have thought<br> she would've been fair.<br> And your husband?<br> What's he like?<br> Medium height, brown hair, kindly,<br> unemotional and not delicate at all.<br> - You said that proudly.<br> - Did I?<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> We've just got time for a cup of tea<br> before our trains go.<br> And for the third time in one week, he<br> brought that common man and his wife...<br> to the house without so much as<br> a "by your leave."<br> - Two teas, please.<br> - Cake or pastry?<br> - Cake or pastry?<br> - No, thank you.<br> - Are those Bath buns fresh?<br> - Certainly they are. Made this morning.<br> Two, please.<br> That'll be sevenpence.<br> - Take the tea to the table, Beryl.<br> - I'll carry the buns.<br> You must eat one of these.<br> Fresh this morning.<br> - Very fattening.<br> - I don't hold to such foolishness.<br> - They do look good, I must say.<br> - One of my earliest passions in life...<br> never outgrown it.<br> - What happened then, Mrs. Bagot?<br> - Well...<br> Well, it's all very fne, I said,<br> expecting me to do this,<br> that and that other,<br> but what do I get out of it?<br> You can't expect me to be a cook,<br> housekeeper and char during the day...<br> and a loving wife in the evening,<br> just because you feel like it.<br> Oh, dear me, no. There are just as good<br> fsh in the sea as ever came out of it.<br> And I packed me boxes<br> then and there and left him.<br> - Didn't you never go back?<br> - Never.<br> Went to my sister's place<br> at Folkestone for a bit.<br> Then I went in with a friend of mine,<br> and we opened a tea shop in Hythe.<br> - What happened to him?<br> - Dead as a doornail inside three years.<br> Well, I never.<br> Is tea bad for one?<br> Worse than coffee, I mean?<br> If this is a professional interview,<br> my fee is a guinea.<br> - Why did you become a doctor?<br> - That's a long story.<br> - Perhaps because I'm an idealist.<br> - I should think all doctors<br> ought to have ideals.<br> - Otherwise their work<br> would be unbearable.<br> - Encouraging me to talk shop?<br> It's what interests you most.<br> Yes, it is.<br> I'm terribly ambitious really.<br> Not ambitious for myself<br> so much as for my special pigeon.<br> - What is your special pigeon?<br> - Preventive medicine.<br> - I see.<br> - I'm afraid you don't.<br> - I was trying to be intelligent.<br> - Most good doctors,<br> especially when they're young,<br> have private dreams.<br> That's the best part of them.<br> Sometimes, though,<br> those get over-professionalized<br> and strangulated... am I boring you?<br> No, I don't quite understand,<br> but you're not boring me.<br> What I mean is this: All good doctors<br> must primarily be enthusiasts.<br> They must, like writers<br> and painters and priests...<br> they must have<br> a sense of vocation,<br> - a deep-rooted, unsentimental<br> desire to do good.<br> - Yes, I see that.<br> Well, obviously one way of preventing<br> disease is worth 50 ways of curing it.<br> That's where my ideal comes in.<br> Preventive medicine isn't<br> anything to do with medicine at all.<br> It's concerned with conditions... living<br> conditions, hygiene and common sense.<br> For instance,<br> my speciality is pneumoconiosis.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Don't be alarmed.<br> It's simpler than it sounds.<br> It's nothing but a slow process<br> of fbrosis of the lung...<br> due to the inhalation<br> of particles of dust.<br> In the hospital here there are<br> splendid opportunities for<br> observing cures, making notes...<br> - because of the coal mines.<br> - You suddenly look much younger.<br> - Do I?<br> - Almost like a little boy.<br> What made you say that?<br> I don't know. Yes, I do.<br> Tell me.<br> Oh, no, I couldn't, really.<br> You were saying about the coal mines.<br> Oh, yes, the inhalation<br> of coal dust.<br> That's one specific form of the disease.<br> It's called anthracosis.<br> What are the others?<br> Chalicosis...<br> that comes from metal dust...<br> steel works, you know.<br> Yes, of course, steel works.<br> And silicosis...<br> that's stone dust...<br> gold mines.<br> I see.<br> - There's your train.<br> - Yes.<br> - You mustn't miss it.<br> - No.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing. Nothing at all, really.<br> It's been so very nice.<br> I've enjoyed my afternoon enormously.<br> I'm so glad. So have I. I apologize<br> for boring you with long medical words.<br> I feel dull and stupid<br> not to be able to understand more.<br> Shall I see you again?<br> It's the other platform, isn't it?<br> You'll have to run.<br> Don't bother about me.<br> - Shall I see you again?<br> - Yes, of course. Perhaps you'd<br> come to Ketchworth one Sunday.<br> - It's rather far, I know,<br> but we should be delighted.<br> - Please, please.<br> - What is it?<br> - Next Thursday, the same time.<br> - No, I couldn't possibly.<br> - Please.<br> I ask you most humbly.<br> - You'll miss your train.<br> - All right.<br> - Run. I'll be there.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> I stood there and watched<br> his train draw out of the station.<br> I stared after it until its taillight<br> had vanished into the darkness.<br> I imagined him getting out<br> at Churley,<br> giving up his ticket,<br> walking back<br> through the streets,<br> letting himself into his house<br> with his latchkey.<br> His wife... Madeleine...<br> would probably be in the hall<br> to meet him.<br> Or perhaps upstairs in her room,<br> not feeling very well.<br> "Small, dark<br> and rather delicate. "<br> I wondered if he'd say,<br> "I met such a nice woman<br> at the Kardomah.<br> We had lunch<br> and went to the pictures. "<br> Then suddenly,<br> I knew that he wouldn't.<br> I knew beyond a shadow of doubt<br> that he wouldn't say a word,<br> At that moment, the first awful feeling<br> of danger swept over me.<br> I got into the first compartment<br> I saw.<br> I wanted to get home<br> as quickly as possible.<br> I looked hurriedly around the carriage<br> to see if anyone was looking at me,<br> as if they could read<br> my secret thoughts.<br> No one was, except a clergyman<br> in the opposite corner.<br> I felt myself blushing and opened<br> my library book and pretended to read.<br> By the time I'd got to Ketchworth,<br> I had made up my mind definitely...<br> - that I wasn't going<br> to see Alec anymore.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.<br> It was silly and undignified flirting<br> like that with a complete stranger.<br> Oh, good evening.<br> I walked up to the house<br> quite briskly and cheerfully.<br> I'd been behaving like an idiot,<br> admittedly, but after all,<br> no harm had been done.<br> You met me in the hall. Your face was<br> strained and worried, and my heart sank.<br> Fred, what's the matter?<br> - It's all right, but you must<br> keep calm and not be upset.<br> - What is it? What's wrong?<br> It's Bobby. He was knocked down<br> by a car on the way home from school.<br> Now it's not serious.<br> He was just grazed by the mudguard,<br> but it knocked him against the curb,<br> and he's got slight concussion.<br> The doctor's upstairs<br> with him now.<br> It's all right, Mrs. Jesson.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> He'll be as right as rain<br> in a few hours.<br> You're sure?<br> You're sure it's not serious?<br> Quite sure, but it was<br> certainly a very lucky escape.<br> I've given him a little sedative,<br> and I shall advise...<br> keeping him at home<br> for a couple of days.<br> It must have been a bit of a shock...<br> I felt so dreadful,<br> Fred, looking at him, lying there...<br> with that bandage<br> round his head.<br> I tried not to show it,<br> but I was quite hysterical inside,<br> as though the whole thing<br> were my fault...<br> a sort of punishment,<br> an awful, sinister warning.<br> An hour of two later, of course,<br> everything became quite normal again.<br> He began to enjoy<br> the whole thing thoroughly...<br> and revelled in the fact<br> that he was the center of attraction.<br> Oh, good!<br> Do you remember how we spent<br> the whole evening planning his future?<br> But he's much too young<br> to decide really.<br> Good life, if the boy has<br> a feeling for it.<br> How can he possibly really know<br> if he has a feeling for it?<br> He'll probably want to be<br> an engine driver next week.<br> No, it was last week<br> he wanted to be an engine driver.<br> It seems so fnal, somehow, entering<br> a child of that age for the navy.<br> - It's a healthy life.<br> - I know it's a good life,<br> and I know it's a healthy life,<br> and I know he'll be able to see the<br> world and have a wife in every port...<br> and keep on calling everybody "sir,"<br> but what about us?<br> - What do you mean, "What about us?"<br> - We shall hardly ever see him.<br> - Oh, nonsense.<br> - It isn't nonsense.<br> He'll be sent away to sea<br> as a smooth-faced boy,<br> and the next thing we know,<br> he'll come walking in<br> with a long beard and a parrot.<br> I think you take rather<br> a Victorian view of the navy, my dear.<br> He's our only son, and I should like<br> to be there while he's growing up.<br> All right, old girl.<br> Then we'll put him into an offce,<br> and you can see him off<br> on the 8:50 every morning.<br> And you can see him off<br> on the 8:50 every morning.<br> You really are very annoying. You know<br> perfectly well I should hate that.<br> All right,<br> have it your own way.<br> - Fred?<br> - Hmm?<br> I had lunch with a strange man today,<br> and he took me to the movies.<br> - Good for you.<br> - He's awfully nice. He's a doctor.<br> - A very noble profession.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> It was Richard III who said,<br> "My kingdom for a horse," wasn't it?<br> Yes, darling.<br> Well, I wish to goodness he hadn't<br> because it spoils everything.<br> I thought perhaps we might<br> ask him to dinner one night.<br> By all means.<br> Who?<br> Dr. Harvey... the one<br> I was telling you about.<br> - Must it be dinner?<br> - Well, you're never at home for lunch.<br> Exactly.<br> Oh, Fred.<br> Now what on earth's<br> the matter?<br> It's nothing.<br> It's only that... Oh, Fred.<br> I really don't see<br> what's so frightfully funny.<br> Oh, I do. It's all right, darling.<br> I'm not laughing at you.<br> I'm laughing at me.<br> I'm the one that's funny.<br> I'm an absolute idiot, worrying myself<br> about things that don't exist...<br> and making mountains<br> out of molehills.<br> I told you when you came in<br> that it was nothing serious.<br> There was nothing to get<br> into such a state about.<br> I do see that now,<br> I really do.<br> When Thursday came,<br> I went to meet Alec,<br> more as a matter of politeness<br> than for any other reason.<br> It didn't seem of any importance,<br> but, after all, I had promised.<br> I managed to get<br> the same table.<br> I wanted a bit,<br> but he didn't come.<br> The ladies'orchestra<br> was playing away, as usual.<br> I looked at the cellist.<br> She seemed to be so funny last week,<br> but today, she didn't seem<br> funny anymore.<br> She looked pathetic,<br> poor thing.<br> After lunch, I happened to pass<br> by the hospital.<br> I remember looking up at the windows<br> and wondering if he were there...<br> or whether something awful<br> had happened to prevent him turning up.<br> I got to the station<br> earlier than usual.<br> I hadn't enjoyed<br> the pictures much.<br> It was one of those noisy<br> musical things, and I'm so sick of them.<br> I had come out<br> before it was over.<br> As I took my tea to the table, I<br> suddenly wondered if I'd made a mistake,<br> and he'd meant me<br> to meet him there.<br> Albert Godby, how dare you!<br> - I couldn't resist.<br> - I'll trouble you to keep<br> your hands to yourself.<br> You're blushing.<br> You look wonderful when you're<br> angry, just like an avenging angel.<br> I'll give you avenging angel,<br> coming in here taking liberties.<br> I thought after what you said<br> last Monday you wouldn't object<br> to a friendly little slap.<br> Never you mind about last Monday.<br> I'm on duty now.<br> A nice thing if Mr. Saunders happened<br> to be looking through the window.<br> If Mr. Saunders is in the habit<br> of looking through windows,<br> it's about time he saw something<br> worth looking at.<br> - You ought to be ashamed of yourself.<br> - It's high spirits, don't be mad.<br> High spirits, indeed.<br> Take your tea, and be quiet.<br> - It's all your fault, really.<br> - I don't know to what you're referring.<br> I was thinking of tonight.<br> If you don't learn to behave there won't<br> be a tonight or any other night, either.<br> - Give us a kiss.<br> - I'll do no such thing.<br> The lady might see us.<br> - Come on, a quick one across the bar.<br> - Albert, stop it!<br> - Come, there's a love.<br> - Let go of me this minute.<br> Albert! Now look at me Banburys<br> all over the floor.<br> Just in time<br> or born in the vestry.<br> You shut your mouth and help<br> Mr. Godby pick up them cakes.<br> Come along now...<br> what are you standing there gaping at?<br> As I left the refreshment room,<br> I saw a train coming in... his train.<br> He wasn't on the platform,<br> and I suddenly felt panic-stricken...<br> at the thought<br> of not seeing him again.<br> My dear, I'm so sorry.<br> I'd no way of letting you know.<br> - Your train, you'll miss it.<br> - The house surgeon<br> had to operate suddenly.<br> I was going to send a note<br> to the Kardomah, but I thought<br> they might shout your name.<br> Please don't say anymore.<br> Quickly, quickly, the whistle's gone.<br> I'm so glad I had a chance to explain.<br> I didn't think I'd see you again.<br> How absurd.<br> Quickly, quickly.<br> - Next Thursday?<br> - Yes, next Thursday.<br> - Good-bye! Next Thursday! Good-bye!<br> - Good-bye!<br> The train for Ketchworth is<br> about to leave from platform three.<br> The stars can change in their courses,<br> the universe go up in flames,<br> and the world crash around us,<br> but there'll always be Donald Duck.<br> I do love him so... his dreadful energy,<br> his blind frustrated rages.<br> It's the big picture now. Here we go.<br> No more laughter. Prepare for tears.<br> It was a terribly bad picture.<br> We crept out before the end,<br> rather furtively,<br> as though<br> we were committing a crime.<br> The usherette at the door<br> looked at us with contempt.<br> It was a lovely afternoon, and<br> it was a relief to be in the fresh air.<br> We decided we'd go<br> to the botanical gardens.<br> Do you know, I believe we should<br> all behave quite differently...<br> if we lived in a warm,<br> sunny climate all the time.<br> We shouldn't be so withdrawn<br> and shy and difficult.<br> Oh, Fred, it really was<br> a lovely afternoon.<br> There were some little boys<br> sailing their boats.<br> One of them looked like Bobby.<br> That should have given me<br> a pang of conscience, I know,<br> but it didn't... I was enjoying myself,<br> enjoying every single minute.<br> Alec suddenly said that he was<br> sick of staring at the water...<br> and that he wanted to be on it.<br> All the boats were covered up,<br> but we managed to persuade<br> the old man to let us have one.<br> He thought we were raving mad.<br> Perhaps he was right.<br> Alec rode off at a great rate,<br> and I trailed my hand<br> in the water.<br> It was very cold,<br> but a lovely feeling.<br> You don't row<br> very well, do you?<br> I'm going to be perfectly honest<br> with you... I don't row at all,<br> and unless you want to go round<br> and round in ever-narrowing circles,<br> you'd better start steering.<br> Oh, we had such fun, Fred.<br> I felt gay and happy<br> and sort of released.<br> That's what's so shameful<br> about it all.<br> That's what would hurt you<br> so much if you knew...<br> that I could feel<br> as intensely as that...<br> away from you,<br> with a stranger.<br> - Oh, look out! We can't get through!<br> - Pull on your left!<br> Oh. Oh, dear, I never could<br> tell left from right.<br> I'm most awfully sorry.<br> You know the British have always<br> been nice to mad people.<br> That boatman thinks we are quite dotty,<br> but look how sweet he's been.<br> Tea, milk, even sugar.<br> Thank you.<br> You know what's happened,<br> don't you?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I've fallen in love<br> with you.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Tell me honestly. Please tell me<br> honestly if what I believe is true.<br> - What do you believe?<br> - That it's the same with you...<br> that you've fallen in love too.<br> - It sounds so silly.<br> - Why?<br> - I know you so little.<br> - It is true, though, isn't it?<br> - Yes, it's true.<br> - Laura.<br> No, please, we must be sensible.<br> Please help me to be sensible.<br> We mustn't behave like this. We must<br> forget that we've said what we've said.<br> - Not yet, not quite yet.<br> - But we must. Don't you see?<br> Listen, it's too late now<br> to be as sensible as all that.<br> It's too late to forget<br> what we've said,<br> and anyway, whether we'd said it or not<br> couldn't have mattered.<br> We know.<br> We've both of us known for a long time.<br> How can you say that?<br> I've only known you for four weeks.<br> We only talked for the frst time<br> last Thursday week.<br> Last Thursday week. Has it been<br> a long time for you since then?<br> - Answer me truly.<br> - Yes.<br> How often did you decide that you were<br> never going to see me again?<br> - Several times a day. Oh, Alec.<br> - So did I.<br> I love you.<br> I love your wide eyes...<br> and the way you smile<br> and your shyness...<br> - and the way you laugh at my jokes.<br> - Please, don't.<br> I love you. I love you.<br> You love me too.<br> It's no use pretending<br> it hasn't happened, because it has.<br> Yes, it has.<br> I don't want to pretend anything either<br> to you or to anyone else,<br> but from now on,<br> I shall have to.<br> That's what's wrong, don't you see?<br> That's what spoils everything.<br> That's why we must stop<br> here and now talking like this.<br> We're neither of us free to love<br> each other. There's too much in the way.<br> There's still time,<br> if we control ourselves<br> and behave like sensible human beings.<br> There's still time to...<br> There's no time at all.<br> - There's your train.<br> - Yes.<br> I'll come over<br> to the platform with you.<br> No, Alec, not here.<br> Someone will see.<br> I love you so.<br> Do you think we might<br> have that down a bit, darling?<br> Hi, Laura.<br> - Yes, dear?<br> - You were miles away.<br> Was I?<br> Yes, I suppose I was.<br> Do you mind if we turn that down<br> a little? It really is deafening.<br> No, of course not.<br> I shan't be long over this,<br> darling, then we'll go to bed.<br> You look a bit tired, you know?<br> Don't hurry.<br> I'm perfectly happy.<br> How can I possibly say that?<br> "Don't hurry.<br> I'm perfectly happy. "<br> If only it were true.<br> Not, I suppose, that anybody<br> is ever perfectly happy, really.<br> But just to be ordinarily contented,<br> to be at peace.<br> It's such a little while ago, really,<br> but it seems an eternity...<br> since that train<br> went out of the station,<br> taking him away<br> into the darkness.<br> I was happy then.<br> As I went back through<br> the subway to my own platform,<br> I was walking on air.<br> When I got into the train,<br> I didn't even pretend to read.<br> I didn't care whether people were<br> looking at me or not. I had to think.<br> I should have been utterly wretched and<br> ashamed. I know I should, but I wasn't.<br> I felt suddenly<br> quite wildly happy,<br> like a romantic schoolgirl,<br> like a romantic fool.<br> You see, he'd said he loved me,<br> and I had said I loved him.<br> And it was true.<br> It was true.<br> I imagined him holding me<br> in his arms.<br> I imagined being with him in all sorts<br> of glamorous circumstances.<br> It was one of those absurd fantasies,<br> just like one has when one is a girl,<br> being wooed and married<br> by the ideal of one's dreams.<br> I stared out of that<br> railway carriage window into the dark...<br> and watched the dim trees<br> and the telegraph posts slipping by,<br> and through them,<br> I saw Alec and me.<br> Alec and me...<br> perhaps a little younger than we are<br> now, but just as much in love...<br> and with nothing in the way.<br> I saw us in Paris,<br> in a box at the opera.<br> The orchestra was tuning up.<br> Then we were in Venice, drifting along<br> the Grand Canal in a gondola...<br> with the sound of mandolins<br> coming to us over the water.<br> I saw us traveling<br> far away together,<br> all the places<br> I've always longed to go.<br> I saw us leaning on the rail of a ship,<br> looking at the sea and stars,<br> standing on a tropical beach<br> in the moonlight...<br> with the palm trees<br> sighing above us.<br> Then the palm trees changed into those<br> pollarded willows by the canal...<br> just before the level crossing,<br> and all the silly dreams<br> disappeared,<br> and I got out at Ketchworth<br> and gave up my ticket...<br> and walked home as usual,<br> quite soberly<br> and without wings...<br> without any wings at all.<br> When I had changed for dinner and was<br> doing my face a bit... Do you remember?<br> I don't suppose you do,<br> but I do.<br> You see, you didn't know that that was<br> the first time in our life together...<br> that I had ever lied to you.<br> It started then...<br> the shame of the whole thing,<br> the guiltiness, the fear.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Jesson.<br> - Hello, dear.<br> - Had a good day?<br> - Yes, lovely.<br> - What'd you do?<br> - Well, I shopped and had lunch<br> and went to the pictures.<br> - All by yourself?<br> - Yes.<br> Uh, no, not exactly.<br> What do you mean,<br> "not exactly"?<br> Well, I went to the pictures by myself,<br> but I had lunch with Mary Norton.<br> She couldn't come to the pictures<br> 'cause she had to see her in-laws.<br> They live just outside<br> Milford, you know?<br> So I walked with her to the bus<br> and then came home on my own.<br> I haven't seen Mary Norton for ages.<br> How is she looking?<br> Very well, really.<br> A little fatter, I thought.<br> Hurry up with all this beautifying.<br> I want my dinner.<br> You go on down.<br> I won't be fve minutes.<br> - Number, please?<br> - Ketchworth 3-7, please.<br> Ketchworth 3-7.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello, is Mrs. Norton there, please?<br> - Yes. Will you hold on?<br> - Yes, I'll hold on.<br> - Hello?<br> - Hello? Is that you, Mary?<br> Oh, Laura! Fancy hearing from you.<br> I thought you were dead.<br> No, I haven't seen you for ages.<br> Listen, my dear,<br> will you be a saint and back me up<br> in the most appalling domestic lie?<br> - As bad as all that?<br> - My life depends on it.<br> Well, today, I went into Milford,<br> as usual, to do my shopping.<br> With the special intention<br> of buying a far too expensive<br> present for Fred's birthday.<br> Well, Spink and Robson's<br> hadn't got what I wanted,<br> which was one of those clocks<br> with barometers and everything in one,<br> but they rang up their branch in<br> Broadham and said there was one there,<br> so I hopped on the 1:30 train<br> and went to get it.<br> - Go on.<br> - Well, this is where<br> the black lie comes in.<br> Fred asked me if I'd had a good day,<br> and I said yes,<br> and that you and I had lunch and<br> that you had gone to see your in-laws...<br> and I had gone<br> to the pictures.<br> - If you run into him,<br> don't let me down, will you?<br> - Darling, of course not.<br> - I'll do as much for you, I promise.<br> - Let's really lunch one day.<br> - Yes, that'd be lovely.<br> - What about next Thursday?<br> No, I can't on Thursday. That's<br> my Milford day. What about Friday?<br> - Fine, better make it here.<br> - All right, perfect.<br> You know what my cook's like.<br> It'll have to be early.<br> Yes, all right.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> That week was misery.<br> I went through it<br> in a sort of trance.<br> How odd of you not to have<br> noticed that you were living<br> with a stranger in the house.<br> Thursday came at last.<br> I had arranged to meet Alec<br> outside the hospital at 12:30.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> I thought you wouldn't come.<br> I've been thinking all week<br> that you wouldn't come.<br> I didn't mean to really,<br> but here I am.<br> I hadn't been inside the Royal<br> since Violet's wedding reception.<br> It all seemed very grand.<br> He actually ordered<br> a bottle of champagne,<br> and when I protested, he said<br> that we were only middle-aged once.<br> We were very gay during lunch and<br> talked about quite ordinary things.<br> Fred, he really was charming.<br> I know you would have liked him<br> if things had been different.<br> As we were going out he said<br> that he had a surprise for me...<br> and that if I would wait<br> in the lounge for five minutes,<br> he'd show me what it was.<br> He went out<br> and down the steps at a run,<br> more like an excited schoolboy<br> than a respectable doctor.<br> Suddenly out of the dining room<br> came Mary Norton and that rich<br> over-made-up cousin of hers.<br> They must have been<br> in the dining room all the time...<br> and seen Alec and me<br> and the champagne and everything.<br> Laura! So it was you after all.<br> Hermione said it was.<br> - How are you?<br> - You know how shortsighted I am.<br> I peered and peered<br> and still couldn't be sure.<br> I never saw you at all. How awful of me.<br> I expect it was the champagne.<br> I'm not used to champagne for lunch<br> or for dinner either, but Alec insisted.<br> Alec? Alec who, dear?<br> Alec Harvey, of course.<br> Surely you remember the Harveys.<br> I've known them for years.<br> - No, I don't think I ever...<br> - He'll be back in a minute.<br> You'll probably recognize him<br> when you peer very closely.<br> He looks very charming<br> and very attentive.<br> He's a dear. One of the nicest people<br> in the world and a wonderful doctor.<br> - Oh, Alec, you remember<br> Mrs. Norton, don't you?<br> - I'm afraid I don't.<br> It's no use, Laura.<br> We've never seen each other<br> before in our lives, I'm sure.<br> How absurd. I made certain<br> he and Madeleine were there<br> when you dined with us...<br> just before Christmas<br> last year.<br> - Alec, this is Mrs. Rolandson.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Horrid weather, isn't it?<br> - Yes.<br> Of course, one can't really<br> expect spring at this time<br> of the year, can one?<br> No.<br> Well, we must be going.<br> I'm taking Hermione with me<br> to the in-laws as moral support.<br> - Good-bye, Dr. Harvey.<br> Good-bye, my dear.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - I do so envy you your champagne.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> - That was awful.<br> - Never mind.<br> They had been watching us<br> all through lunch. Oh, dear.<br> Forget it. Come out<br> and look at the surprise.<br> There at the foot of the steps<br> was a little two-seater car.<br> Alec had borrowed it<br> from Stephen Lynn for the afternoon.<br> I tried so hard to look pleased,<br> but it wasn't any good.<br> I kept thinking of those two<br> laughing and talking,<br> laughing and talking about us,<br> and I couldn't get them out of my mind.<br> When we were out in the real country...<br> a few miles beyond Brayfield...<br> we stopped the carjust outside<br> a village and got out.<br> There was a little bridge<br> and a stream,<br> and the sun was making an effort<br> to come out, but really<br> not succeeding very well.<br> We leaned on the parapet of the bridge<br> and looked down into the water.<br> I shivered,<br> and Alec put his arm round me.<br> - Cold?<br> - No, not really.<br> Happy?<br> No, not really.<br> I know exactly what<br> you're going to say.<br> That it isn't worth it.<br> That the furtiveness and lying outweigh<br> the happiness we might have together.<br> Isn't that it?<br> Something like that.<br> I want to ask you something,<br> just to reassure myself.<br> What is it?<br> It is true for you, isn't it?<br> This overwhelming feeling<br> we have for each other...<br> it's as true for you<br> as it is for me, isn't it?<br> Yes, it's true.<br> We must have stayed<br> on that bridge for a long time,<br> because when we got back to Stephen<br> Lynn's garage, it was getting dark.<br> I remember feeling as if<br> I was on the edge of a precipice.<br> I think Alec felt that too.<br> You see, we both knew<br> how desperately we loved each other.<br> Alec said he had to leave the keys<br> of the car in Stephen Lynn's flat...<br> and suggested<br> that I came up with him.<br> I refused rather too vehemently.<br> Alec reminded me that Stephen<br> wasn't coming back till late,<br> but I still refused.<br> I'm going back.<br> I'm going to miss my train.<br> - Back where?<br> - To Stephen's flat.<br> - Train Whistle Blowing]<br> - Oh, Alec.<br> Alec, I must go home now.<br> I really must go home.<br> A cup of tea, please.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Afternoon, lady.<br> - Afternoon.<br> - Couple of whiskeys, please.<br> - Very sorry. It's out of hours.<br> Well, just sneak 'em to us under<br> the cover of them poor old sandwiches.<br> Them sandwiches were fresh this morning,<br> and I shall do no such thing.<br> - Come on, be a sport.<br> - You can have as much<br> as you want after 6:00.<br> My throat's like a parrot's cage.<br> Listen.<br> I'm sorry. My license does not<br> permit me to serve alcohol out of hours.<br> That's fnal. You wouldn't want<br> to get me into trouble, would you?<br> Just give us the chance, lady. That's<br> all we ask. Just give us the chance.<br> - Beryl!<br> - Yes, Mrs. Bagot?<br> - Ask Mr. Godby to come here<br> a moment, will you?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Bagot.<br> - Oh, and who's he when he's at home?<br> - You'll soon see.<br> - Coming in here cheeking me.<br> - Come off it, Mother. Be a pal.<br> - I'll give you "Mother,"<br> you saucy upstart.<br> - Oi, who you callin' an upstart?<br> You! And I'll trouble you<br> to get out of here double quick.<br> Disturbing the customers and<br> making a nuisance of yourselves.<br> Here, where's the fre,<br> where's the fre?<br> - What's going on in here?<br> - Mr. Godby,<br> these gentlemen are annoying me.<br> - What? We haven't done nothing,<br> have we, Johnnie?<br> - All we did was ask for drinks.<br> - They insulted me, Mr. Godby.<br> - We never did anything of the kind.<br> - Just having a little joke, that's all.<br> - Hop it, both of you.<br> - We've got a right to stay here<br> as long as we like.<br> - You heard what I said. Hop it.<br> Now, look here. What is this, a free<br> country or a bloomin' Sunday school?<br> I checked your warrants at the gate.<br> Your train's due in one minute. Hop it.<br> - Now, look here...<br> - Aw, come on, Johnnie. Come on.<br> - Don't argue with the poor basket.<br> - Hop it.<br> Cheerio, Mother.<br> And if them sandwiches were made<br> this morning, you're Shirley Temple.<br> - Thank you, Albert.<br> - What a nerve... talking to you<br> like that, Mrs. Bagot.<br> Be quiet, Beryl. Pour me out a nip<br> of Three Star. I'm feeling quite upset.<br> - I have to get back to the gate.<br> - I'll be seeing you later, Albert.<br> Okay.<br> The train<br> now arriving at platform three...<br> is the 5:43 for Ketchworth.<br> - I really must go home.<br> - I'm going back to the flat.<br> - I must go home.<br> I really must go home.<br> - I'm going back to the flat.<br> I'm going home.<br> Excuse me.<br> I've forgotten something.<br> Darling.<br> It's raining.<br> It started just as I turned out<br> of the High Street.<br> You had no umbrella,<br> and your coat's wet.<br> You mustn't catch cold.<br> That would never do.<br> - I look an absolute fright.<br> - Let me put that down for you.<br> Thank you.<br> I hope the fre will<br> perk up in a few minutes.<br> - I expect the wood was damp.<br> - Yes, I expect it was.<br> Do sit down, darling.<br> I got right into the train and then<br> got out again. Wasn't it idiotic?<br> We're both very,<br> very foolish.<br> - Alec, I can't stay, you know.<br> Really, I can't.<br> - Just a little while.<br> Just a little while.<br> Quickly, quickly!<br> I must go.<br> - Here, through the kitchen.<br> There's a tradesman's staircase.<br> - Is that you, Alec?<br> - Yes.<br> - You're back early.<br> - Yes, I felt a cold coming on,<br> so I denied myself<br> the questionable pleasure of dining...<br> with that arch-arguer Roger Hinchley<br> and decided to come back to bed.<br> - Inflamed membranes are<br> unsympathetic to a dialectic.<br> - What'll you do about food?<br> I can always ring down to the restaurant<br> if I want any later on.<br> - We live in a modern age,<br> and this is a service flat.<br> - Yes, yes, of course.<br> It caters for all tastes.<br> You know, my dear Alec, you have hidden<br> depths which I never even suspected.<br> - Look here, Stephen...<br> - Oh, for heaven's sake, Alec.<br> No explanations or apologies.<br> I am the one who should apologize<br> for returning so inopportunely.<br> It's quite obvious to me that you were<br> interviewing a patient privately.<br> Women are frequently<br> rather neurotic creatures,<br> and the hospital atmosphere<br> is upsetting to them.<br> By the rather undignifed scuffling<br> which I heard when I came into the hall,<br> I gather that she beat<br> a hasty retreat down the back stairs.<br> I'm surprised at this farcical streak<br> in your nature, Alec.<br> Such carryings-on are quite unnecessary.<br> After all, we've been friends for years,<br> and I am the most<br> broad-minded of men.<br> I'm really very sorry,<br> Stephen.<br> I'm sure that the whole situation<br> must seem inexpressibly vulgar to you.<br> Actually,<br> it isn't in the least.<br> However, you're perfectly right:<br> Explanations are unnecessary,<br> particularly between friends.<br> - I must go now.<br> I'll collect my hat and coat.<br> - Very well.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Perhaps you'll let me<br> have my latchkey back.<br> I only have two,<br> and I'm so afraid of losing them.<br> You know how absentminded I am.<br> - You're very angry, aren't you?<br> - No, Alec, not angry, just disappointed.<br> I ran until I couldn't run any longer.<br> I leant against a lamppost<br> to get my breath.<br> I was in one of those side roads<br> that lead out of the High Street.<br> I know it was stupid to run,<br> but I couldn't help myself.<br> I felt so utterly humiliated<br> and defeated and so dreadfully,<br> dreadfully ashamed.<br> After a moment or two<br> I pulled myself together...<br> and walked on<br> in the direction of the station.<br> It was still raining,<br> but not very much.<br> I suddenly realized<br> that I couldn't go home,<br> not until I had got myself more under<br> control and had a little time to think.<br> Then I thought of you waiting at home<br> and the dinner being spoilt,<br> so I went into the High Street and found<br> a tobacconist and telephoned to you.<br> Do you remember?<br> Hello, Fred, is that you?<br> Yes, dear, it's me, Laura.<br> Yes, everything's perfectly all right,<br> but I shan't be home to dinner.<br> I'm with Miss Lewis.<br> Miss Lewis, dear. You know,<br> the librarian I told you about at Boots.<br> Y- Yes, I can't explain in any detail<br> because she's outside the box now.<br> I met her in the High Street a little<br> while ago in a terrible state.<br> Her mother's been taken ill,<br> and I've promised to stay<br> with her until the doctor comes.<br> Yes, I know, but she's always<br> been awfully kind to me,<br> and I feel so sorry for her.<br> No, I'll get a sandwich, but<br> ask Ethel to leave me some soup<br> in a saucepan in the kitchen.<br> Yes, of course,<br> as soon as I can.<br> All right. Good-bye.<br> It's awfully easy to lie when you know<br> that you're trusted implicitly...<br> so very easy<br> and so very degrading.<br> I started walking<br> without much purpose.<br> I turned out of the High Street<br> almost immediately.<br> I was terrified<br> that I might run into Alec.<br> I was pretty certain that he'd<br> come after me to the station.<br> I walked for a long while. Finally,<br> I found myself at the war memorial...<br> you know, it's right<br> at the other side of the town.<br> It had stopped raining altogether,<br> and I felt stiflingly hot,<br> so I sat down<br> on one of the seats.<br> There was nobody about,<br> and I lit a cigarette.<br> I know how you disapprove<br> of women smoking in the street...<br> I do too, really...<br> but I wanted to calm my nerves,<br> and I thought it might help.<br> I sat there for ages...<br> I don't know how long...<br> then I noticed a policeman<br> walking up and down a little way off.<br> He was looking at me<br> rather suspiciously.<br> Presently he came up to me.<br> Feeling all right, miss?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Waiting for someone?<br> No. No, I'm not<br> waiting for anybody.<br> Don't go and catch cold now. It's a damp<br> night for sitting about on seats.<br> I'm going now anyhow.<br> I've got to catch a train.<br> You're sure you feel<br> quite all right?<br> Quite, thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, miss.<br> I walked away, trying to look casual,<br> knowing that he was watching me.<br> I felt like a criminal.<br> I walked rather quickly back<br> in the direction of the High Street.<br> I got to the station 15 minutes<br> before the last train to Ketchworth.<br> And then I realized that I'd been<br> wandering about for over three hours,<br> but it didn't seem to be<br> any time at all.<br> Stan, you are awful.<br> - See ya in the yard.<br> - All right.<br> - I'd like a glass of brandy, please.<br> - We're just closin'.<br> Yes, I see you are, but you're<br> not quite closed yet, are you?<br> - Three Star?<br> - That'll do.<br> Oh, and have you got<br> a piece of paper and an envelope?<br> - I'm afraid you'll have to<br> get that at the book stall.<br> - Well, the book stall's closed.<br> Please, it's very important.<br> I should be so much obliged.<br> All right.<br> Just a minute.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - We close in a few minutes, you know.<br> Yes, I know.<br> - Darling, I've been<br> looking for you everywhere.<br> - Please go away. Please don't.<br> - I've watched every train.<br> - Please go away.<br> - I can't leave you like this.<br> - You must. It'll be better,<br> really it will.<br> You're being dreadfully cruel.<br> It was just an accident<br> that he came back early.<br> - He doesn't know who you are.<br> He never even saw you.<br> - He laughed, didn't he?<br> - I suppose you spoke of me<br> together as men of the world.<br> - We didn't speak of you.<br> - We spoke of some nameless<br> creature who has no reality.<br> - Why didn't you tell him?<br> Why didn't you say we were cheap<br> and low and without courage?<br> - Stop it, Laura. Pull yourself together.<br> - It's true.<br> It's nothing of the sort.<br> We know we love each other.<br> That's all that matters.<br> It isn't all that matters.<br> Other things matter too.<br> Self-respect matters, and decency.<br> I can't go on any longer.<br> Could you really say good-bye,<br> never see me again?<br> Yes, if you'd help me.<br> I love you, Laura. I shall love you<br> always until the end of my life.<br> I can't look at you now<br> because I know something.<br> I know that this is<br> the beginning of the end...<br> not the end of my loving you,<br> the end of our being together.<br> But not quite yet, darling.<br> Please, not quite yet.<br> Very well.<br> Not quite yet.<br> I know what you feel about this<br> evening... about the sordidness of it.<br> I know about the strain of our different<br> lives... our lives apart from each other.<br> The feeling of guilt, doing wrong<br> is too strong, isn't it?<br> Too great a price to pay<br> for the happiness we have together.<br> I know all this<br> because it's the same for me too.<br> You can look at me now.<br> I'm all right.<br> Let's be very careful.<br> Let's prepare ourselves.<br> A sudden break now, however brave<br> and admirable, would be too cruel.<br> We can't do such violence<br> to our hearts and minds.<br> Very well.<br> - I'm going away.<br> - I see.<br> - But not quite yet.<br> - Please, not quite yet.<br> - That's the 10:10.<br> It's after closing time.<br> - Oh, is it?<br> - I shall have to lock up.<br> - All right.<br> - I want you to promise me something.<br> - What is it?<br> Promise me that however<br> unhappy you are...<br> and however much<br> you think things over,<br> - that you'll meet me<br> again next Thursday.<br> - Where?<br> Outside the hospital<br> at 12:30.<br> - All right. I promise.<br> - I've got to talk to you.<br> I've got to explain.<br> - About going away?<br> - Yes.<br> - Where will you go?<br> Where can you go?<br> - You can't give up your practice.<br> I've had a job offered me.<br> I wasn't going to tell you.<br> I wasn't going to take it,<br> but I know now it's the only way out.<br> - Where?<br> - A long way away... Johannesburg.<br> - Oh, Alec.<br> - My brother's out there.<br> They're opening a new hospital.<br> They want me in it.<br> It's a fne opportunity, really.<br> I'll take Madeleine and the boys.<br> It's been torturing me...<br> the necessity of making<br> a decision one way or the other.<br> I haven't told anybody,<br> not even Madeleine.<br> I couldn't bear<br> the thought of leaving you,<br> but now I see it's<br> got to happen soon anyway.<br> It's almost happening already.<br> Stanley!<br> When will you go?<br> Almost immediately,<br> in about two weeks' time.<br> - Quite near, isn't it?<br> - Do you want me to stay?<br> - Do you want me to turn down the offer?<br> - Don't be foolish, Alec.<br> - I'll do whatever you say.<br> - That's unkind of you, my darling.<br> The train for Ketchworth is<br> now arriving at platform three.<br> You're not<br> angry with me, are you?<br> No, I'm not angry.<br> I don't think I'm anything, really.<br> I just feel tired.<br> - Forgive me?<br> - Forgive you for what?<br> For everything...<br> for meeting you in the frst place,<br> for taking the piece<br> of grit out of your eye,<br> for loving you,<br> for bringing you so much misery.<br> I'll forgive you<br> if you'll forgive me.<br> Thursday.<br> All that was a week ago.<br> It's hardly credible<br> that it should be so short a time.<br> Today was<br> our last day together...<br> our very last together<br> in all our lives.<br> I met him outside the hospital<br> as I had promised at 12:30...<br> at 12:30 this morning.<br> That was only this morning.<br> We drove into the country again,<br> but this time he hired a car.<br> I lit cigarettes for him<br> every now and then as we went along.<br> We didn't talk much.<br> I felt numbed and hardly alive at all.<br> We had lunch in a village pub.<br> Afterwards, we went to the same bridge<br> over the stream,<br> the bridge that we'd<br> been to before.<br> Those last few hours<br> went by so quickly.<br> As we walked through the station<br> I remember thinking,<br> "This is the last time<br> with Alec.<br> I shall see all this again,<br> but without Alec. "<br> I tried not to think of it,<br> not to let it spoil<br> our last moments together.<br> Are you all right,<br> darling?<br> Yes, I'm all right.<br> I wish I could think of something<br> to say. It doesn't matter...<br> - not saying anything, I mean.<br> - I'll miss my train<br> and see you to yours.<br> - Please don't. I'll come over<br> to your platform. I'd rather.<br> - Very well.<br> Do you think we shall ever<br> see each other again?<br> I don't know.<br> Not for years anyway.<br> The children will<br> all be grown up.<br> I wonder if they'll ever<br> meet and know each other.<br> Couldn't I write to you,<br> just once in a while?<br> No, Alec, please.<br> You know we promised.<br> Well, all right, dear.<br> I do love you so very much.<br> I love you with<br> all my heart and soul.<br> I want to die.<br> If only I could die.<br> If you died, you'd forget me.<br> I want to be remembered.<br> Yes, I know. I do too.<br> - We've still got a few minutes.<br> - Laura!<br> What a lovely surprise.<br> My dear, I've been<br> shopping till I'm dropping.<br> My feet are nearly falling off.<br> My throat's parched.<br> I thought of having tea at Spindle's,<br> but I was terrifed of losing the train.<br> - Oh, dear!<br> - Oh, this is Dr. Harvey.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do? Would you be<br> a dear and get me a cup of tea?<br> - I don't think I could drag<br> my poor bones to the counter.<br> - No, please.<br> It was cruel of fate<br> to be against us right up<br> to the very last minute.<br> Dolly Messiter... poor, well-meaning,<br> irritating Dolly Messiter...<br> crashing into those last few<br> precious minutes we had together.<br> She chattered and fussed,<br> but I didn't hear what she said.<br> - I felt dazed and bewildered.<br> - Oh, dear. No sugar.<br> - It's in the spoon.<br> - Alec behaved so beautifully,<br> with such perfect politeness.<br> No one could have guessed<br> what he was really feeling.<br> And then...<br> - There's your train.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - Oh, aren't you coming with us?<br> - I go in the opposite direction.<br> My practice is in Churley.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - I'm a general practitioner<br> at the moment.<br> - Dr. Harvey's going out<br> to Africa next week.<br> - Oh, how thrilling.<br> The train now<br> arriving at platform four...<br> is the 5:40 for Churley,<br> Leigh Green and Langdon.<br> - I must go. Good-bye.<br> - Yes, you must.<br> Good-bye.<br> I felt the touch of his hand<br> on my shoulder for a moment,<br> and then he walked away...<br> away,<br> out of my life forever.<br> He's got to get<br> right over to the other platform.<br> Talking of missing trains reminds me of<br> that awful bridge at Broadham Junction.<br> Dolly still went on talking,<br> but I wasn't listening to her.<br> - I was listening for the sound<br> of his train starting.<br> Then it did.<br> I said to myself,<br> "He didn't go.<br> "At the last minute his courage<br> failed him. He couldn't have gone.<br> Any minute he'll come back into<br> the refreshment room pretending<br> he's forgotten something. "<br> I prayed for him to do that,<br> just so that I could<br> see him again for an instant.<br> But the minutes went by.<br> Is that the train? Oh, can you tell me,<br> is that the Ketchworth train?<br> - No, it's the express.<br> - The boat train.<br> That doesn't stop,<br> does it?<br> - I want some chocolate, please.<br> - Milk or plain?<br> I meant to do it, Fred.<br> I really meant to do it.<br> I stood there trembling<br> right on the edge,<br> but I couldn't.<br> I wasn't brave enough.<br> I'd like to say it was the thought of<br> you and the children that prevented me,<br> but it wasn't.<br> I had no thoughts at all,<br> only an overwhelming desire<br> not to feel anything ever again,<br> not to be unhappy anymore.<br> I turned...<br> and went back<br> into the refreshment room.<br> That's when I nearly fainted.<br> Laura.<br> Yes, dear?<br> Whatever your dream was,<br> it wasn't a very happy one, was it?<br> No.<br> Is there anything<br> I can do to help?<br> Yes, Fred.<br> You always help.<br> You've been<br> a long way away.<br> Yes.<br> Thank you for coming<br> back to me.<br>
