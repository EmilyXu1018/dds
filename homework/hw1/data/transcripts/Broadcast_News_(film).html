                        I don't know a recent<br> Saturday I've sold more<br> Why so glum?<br> Were you bothering by<br> those waitresses making a fuss?<br> No.<br> But, honest. What are you supposed to say<br> when they keep talking about your looks?<br> I don't even know what they mean<br> "Beat them off with a stick. "<br> if that's your only problem<br> It's not<br> I got my report card<br> Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.<br> I see you studying so hard, Tom.<br> What do you think the problem is?<br> I'll just have to try harder.<br> I don't know.<br> I will. I will. I will.<br> I will...<br> Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.<br> Will you sign it, please?<br> Would it help if I got you a tutor?<br> That would be great<br> It better help<br> What can you do with yourself<br> if all you do is look good?<br> I'm frequently asked<br> what the special difficulties...<br> ...are in being graduated from High School...<br> two months shy of my fifteenth birthday.<br> I sometimes think it was the difficulties<br> themselves which enabled me to do it.<br> If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated...<br> ...I wouldn't have been in<br> such a hurry to graduate.<br> I hope the next student<br> who comes along and is able to excel...<br> ...isn't made to feel so much an outcast.<br> But, I'm looking forward to college;<br> ...and this is the happiest day<br> I've had in a long time.<br> So, I thank you and I forgive you.<br> Go ahead, Stephen. Take your last licks.<br> But this will heal<br> what I'm going to say to you<br> will scar you forever.<br> Ready? Here it is.<br> You'll never make more than<br> nineteen thousand dollars a year.<br> Okay, what about this:<br> You'll never leave South Boston<br> and I'm going to see the whole damn world.<br> You'll never know the pleasure<br> of writing a graceful sentence...<br> ...or having an original thought.<br> Think about it.<br> Nineteen thousand dollars...<br> Not bad.<br> Dear Felatzia,<br> ...it's truly amazing to me...<br> ...that we live a world apart<br> and yet have the same favorite music.<br> I loved the picture you sent...<br> and have it up on my bulletin board.<br> You're growing...<br> Honey?<br> Oh God<br> Daddy. Don't ever do that to me.<br> Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.<br> I just have two more pen pals<br> and then I'm done.<br> Finish quickly. I don't want you<br> getting obsessive about these things.<br> Good night.<br> Dad, you want me to choose<br> my words so carefully...<br> ...and then you just throw<br> a word like'obsessive' at me.<br> Now, unless I'm wrong<br> please correct me if I am,<br> ...obsession is practically<br> a psychiatric term...<br> concerning people who don't have anything<br> else but the object of their obsession...<br> ...who can't stop and do anything else.<br> Well, Here I am stopping to tell you this.<br> Okay?<br> So would you please try and<br> be a little more precise...<br> instead of calling a person<br> something like'obsessive'<br> Good night.<br> Hi. It's me.<br> It's thirty minutes<br> before you have to meet me in the lobby...<br> ...nudge your mate.<br> I don't think it's time to eat...<br> ...but there's a cafeteria<br> at the bus depot once we get down there.<br> I love working with you two.<br> It saves me a call.<br> Hi. Turn on your TV...<br> Arnold Schwarzenegger on the today's show<br> Good Morning America and the Morning News...<br> ...and I think he's live on<br> at least two of them.<br> At 6 o'clock on the wake-up news<br> they used the wrong missile graphic.<br> And they call me this morning to say...<br> Now listen, Arnold just said that<br> he's been making three million a movie now.<br> But he's not ever gonna change.<br> He's still the same person when<br> he was making two million dollars a movie.<br> He feels no different.<br> He also bought a brand-new condo with Maria,<br> they gonna furnish tastefully.<br> A half hour in the lobby.<br> Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies.<br> There he is.<br> Hi.<br> I'd like to talk to you for a second.<br> Just a few questions?<br> No.<br> We came from Washington.<br> Move away from me.<br> Last week he was...<br> Ok No. Watch this.<br> I want you to watch this.<br> Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot...<br> Fuckee.<br> You want to use that?<br> It depends on how big a news day it is.<br> Thanks.<br> I can't believe he said that.<br> Very proud of<br> He really...<br> You should work on your speech.<br> No.<br> It makes me nervous to think about it.<br> Let's do this.<br> We are being increasingly influenced<br> by the star system.<br> The network anchormen are so powerful<br> they compromise our last best hope.<br> Our profession is in danger.<br> The current group is clearly qualified,<br> ...tied still to our best traditions, but...<br> ...who follows these men?<br> Excuse me.<br> We are being pressured...<br> detect a loyalty...<br> Oh, I've known so many women like that.<br> They don't like their looks<br> so they're angry.<br> Excuse me.<br> Sure.<br> All of you know what I'm talking about.<br> We're all trying to act together<br> than we are.<br> But we care.<br> So, we're all secretly terrified,<br> aren't we?<br> I was going to talk about other trends<br> but...<br> ...the magazine shows, news at profit,<br> ...the historic influence of<br> Entertainment Tonight,<br> ...the danger, the hope,<br> the dream, the question...<br> Oh,<br> I was going to show you a tape.<br> a story that was carried by<br> all networks on the same night<br> ...the same night that not one...<br> network noted a major policy change in<br> Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...<br> Here's what they ran instead...<br> Go ahead please.<br> Show the tape.<br> I know it's good film.<br> I know it's fun. I like fun.<br> It's just not news.<br> Well, you're lucky you love it.<br> you're going to get a lot more just like it.<br> Good.<br> Thank you<br> I dont think to be any q and a<br> Hi.<br> Hello.<br> I just wanted to tell you<br> how great you were.<br> My name's Tom Grunick.<br> Thank you<br> They hated me.<br> I don't hate them.<br> They say if you can reach even one person,<br> it means something...<br> And you did that.<br> Would you like to have dinner with me?<br> Sure<br> Another thing I can't stand<br> Is this dull?<br> no. No. No.<br> Another thing I can't stand is...<br> ...when White House reporters bullshit<br> with each other after a briefing...<br> ...and then one of them has a theory...<br> ...and the other quotes it in his story as...<br> ..."White House" sources say...<br> That actually goes on.<br> Yes.<br> I am not tired.<br> My room is down here.<br> Do you want to keep talking?<br> Yes, sure.<br> Come on.<br> Even I'm not that hard on myself.<br> No, really.<br> I got this job on a fluke...<br> ...and wait till you hear where it ends up.<br> I was doing sports at the station.<br> The newspaper ran this untrue story<br> that I was leaving...<br> ...and they got all these<br> tons of protest mail.<br> So.<br> So they made me anchor.<br> So great, right?<br> Except I'm no good at<br> what I'm being a success at.<br> How are you at back rubs?<br> It's sort of normal the way you feel.<br> In graduate school<br> everyone thought the only mistake...<br> ...the admission committee made was<br> letting them in.<br> Listen to me.<br> You keep on thinking I'm somebody who...<br> ...who lacks confidence.<br> That's not it.<br> I know I can talk well enough...<br> ...and I'm not bad at<br> making contact with people,<br> ...but I don't like the feeling that<br> I'm pretending to be a reporter.<br> And half the time I don't get the unders...<br> ...the news I'm talking about.<br> It isn't that I'm down on myself.<br> Trust me,<br> I stink.<br> I trust you.<br> I didn't even have the chance<br> to get really good at sports.<br> I wasn't bad.<br> What about the obvious remedy?<br> Reversing things.<br> Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.<br> I don't write.<br> But that didn't stop me from<br> sending out audition tapes to the...<br> ...bigger stations and the networks.<br> Well, come on.<br> it is your life.<br> Nobody is tying you to the fast track.<br> Did you go to college?<br> So, you're not well educated and<br> you have almost no experience...<br> and you can't write.<br> Yeah. And I'm...<br> And I'm making a fortune.<br> It's hard...<br> ...for me to advise you...<br> ...since you personify something<br> that I truly think is dangerous.<br> I agree with you. You're not qualified.<br> So get qualified.<br> You can insist on being better prepared.<br> You don't have to just leave it with...<br> 'I don't write. I'm not schooled...<br> ...I don't understand the news I'm reading...<br> ...But at least I'm upset about it, folks. '<br> Whoa.<br> Just what do you want from me, anyway?<br> Permission to be a fake?<br> Stop whining...<br> ...do something about it.<br> Well, you don't have to start right now.<br> I hated the way you talked to me just now...<br> ...and it wasn't just because<br> you were right.<br> Oh God.<br> No.<br> It wasn't just the speech...<br> ...the same thing happened with this guy.<br> I have passed some line some place.<br> I am beginning to repel people<br> I'm trying to seduce.<br> He must have been great-looking, right?<br> Why do you say that?<br> Because nobody invites a bad-looking idiot<br> to their bedroom.<br> Okay. Let's do me.<br> Sure.<br> I feel like I'm slipping...<br> ...but do people who are actually<br> slipping feel that way...<br> ...or is it always the really good people<br> who are moving up...<br> ...who invariably think they're slipping<br> because their standards are so high?<br> This conversation is not worthy of you.<br> I'd give anything if that were true.<br> Good night.<br> Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity<br> and desperation made us more attractive?<br> If needy were a turn-on?<br> Call if you get weird.<br> Take care.<br> I will.<br> I was just thinking it was the<br> shortest phone conversation we ever had.<br> I never told you the reason<br> I was telling you everything for.<br> Hey?<br> Those audition tapes I sent out...<br> I've been hired by your network<br> for the Washington bureau.<br> So I'll probably see you at work.<br> What?<br> Sorry.<br> They didn't hire Peter Stiller from<br> the Times and he had a great audition tape.<br> You want to start going over<br> who they could have gotten?<br> They can't take on people like this<br> for network news.<br> For God's sake. What's going on?<br> Okay, what about this?<br> Here's a tough ethical one.<br> Would you tell a source that you loved them<br> just to get some information?<br> Yes. Yes. Me too. Sure. You bet.<br> Jennifer didn't know<br> there was an alternative.<br> Here's a good one.<br> They allow us to have cameras<br> at an execution in Florida.<br> Do you broadcast tape of the guy<br> in the chair when they turn on the voltage?<br> Sure.<br> Why not?<br> Absolutely.<br> You bet.<br> Nothing like wrestling<br> with a moral dilemma is there?<br> yeah. Yeah.<br> Speak to you later.<br> Ok Bobby. Go back to 9-40, 5-40<br> We could...<br> Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.<br> They said I should observe the...<br> They said it would be okay if...<br> We're working here!<br> You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...<br> Play back the last line...<br> Thanks.<br> Bobby?<br> He said something about...<br> Let me hear it!<br> Jane.<br> We'll need it in 14 minutes.<br> We're putting it directly into the...<br> Jane, Craig, just a second.<br> Let me hear it!<br> It's been a long time<br> since I've seen my folks and all but...<br> ...I don't expect any big-deal homecoming.<br> Stop there.<br> I want to shoot the home-coming<br> from a book I have in the office.<br> You don't have time. Not a chance.<br> I'll be right down. It's right tight.<br> I've got to tell Ernie...<br> because there isn't enough time.<br> Yes, there is.<br> I don't think she's going to make it.<br> Okay, Bobbie,<br> just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.<br> Should I...<br> Just a two-second dissolve.<br> Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...<br> Why do you do this to me.<br> Is it because I won an award?<br> Home coming...<br> Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait.<br> The return of a fighting man has always been<br> one of the more moving ceremonies of war...<br> We have a minute and a half.<br> It's my responsibility<br> to tell them we won't be ready.<br> Uh-uh. We're be ready.<br> In 84 seconds?<br> Oh, God.<br> You're saying'Oh, God...<br> They are going to go to up<br> and the screen will be black...<br> ...they're going to go to black<br> because we're not there.<br> How about careers, huh?<br> We're not going to make it.<br> Whoops.<br> We got it.<br> No there she is.<br> Ok, stand by.<br> Home coming.<br> Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait<br> The return of a fighting man has always been<br> one of the more moving ceremonies of war...<br> Tearful women, proud men, excited children.<br> But J.D.

That's a big smile.<br> I haven't seen Bill smile<br> like that in weeks.<br> Good piece.<br> Thanks Ernie.<br> I'm gonna see it again. Ernie?<br> He did smile.<br> Don't tell anyone I do this.<br> I'm sorry if I was in the way.<br> It was totally impressive. Great piece.<br> You weren't. Thanks.<br> How does it feel being here?<br> I can't believe I'm really here.<br> Do you know where Martin went?<br> I think he went downstairs. -Ok, thanks.<br> I can't believe I'm really here.<br> No I'm wrong.<br> He went to research.<br> I can't believe I'm really here.<br> No kidding.<br> If you're through work now...<br> No. Aaron and I go to Central America<br> on Wednesday so I'm cramming.<br> I thought you were incredible in there.<br> Everybody was.<br> I know how much I have to learn.<br> I'd really a lot appreciate it... if...<br> 'Really a lot appreciate it...

I'm paid to mix.<br> Goodbye, Paul.<br> Take care, Paul.<br> It takes a certain kind of...<br> ...courage to talk like that in front<br> of the President of the News Division.<br> You think anyone who's proud of<br> the work we do is an ass kisser.<br> No.<br> I think anyone who puckers their lips and...<br> ...presses it against his<br> boss' buttocks and then...<br> ...smooches is an ass kisser.<br> My gosh,<br> and for a while there,<br> I was attracted to you.<br> Wait a minute<br> that changes everything.<br> x<br> Martin, would you excuse us for a minute.<br> No.<br> Come on.<br> You know I didn't mean to ask<br> This is very awkward.<br> I see Tom around you a lot...<br> ...and this is such a small office<br> and I'd like to see him outside of work,<br> unless there's some reason for you to mind<br> in which case I just won't do anything.<br> Whew.

He can't hear me...<br> I told you if there was one thing...<br> I can hear you. I was just teasing.<br> Good afternoon.<br> A Libyan fighter plane attacked...<br> ...a United States Military Installation<br> at Sicilia at 10.07am.<br> Libyan made 21 and it was itself<br> shot down by American F-14 Interceptors.<br> The Libyan missile destroyed an army<br> warehouse which, just 30 minutes earlier,<br> ...had been crowded with servicemen.<br> When we take it back...<br> I can sing while I read...<br> I can singing and reading both.<br> The Libyan made 21...<br> on the U.S. air station at Sicilia.<br> The heat seeking missile virtually<br> disintegrated the plane on contact...<br> All remote stand by please.<br> George, you're ready?<br> Yeah<br> Should I cover everything or should<br> I save something for Tom to ask about?<br> Cover everything!<br> Ok, we're going to George.<br> Say'the Joint Chiefs are meeting<br> we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.<br> George Weln is at the Pentagon and reports...<br> ...that the attack launched<br> by the lone Libyan pilot...<br> ...has resulted in a massive<br> movement of US military might.<br> A lot of alliteration from anxious<br> anchors placed in powerful posts.<br> x<br> It's Aaron.<br> Yes?<br> Hi.<br> Listen. The pilot that shot down the<br> Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.<br> Maybe you could get him.<br> Also Tom should say that F-14 is<br> one of the hardest planes to fly.<br> And They're nicknamed'Tomcats'.<br> Thanks.<br> The F-14 is one of the most<br> difficult planes to master.<br> They called'Tomcats'<br> George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat...<br> ...one of the most difficult<br> machines for a pilot to master?<br> I think you're right.<br> and in the 70's the first crop<br> had a number of crashes.<br> There was trouble with them<br> in the early days back in the 70's.<br> Thank you George.<br> Jennifer Mack.<br> I say it here. It comes out there.<br> Hi.<br> Me again.<br> Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam<br> at the mouth or anything.<br> When you speak to him he's not at all nuts.<br> He seems like a leader very impressive,<br> self-control... that's what's so crazy.<br> Ok good. And we have the'81 pilot on<br> the way in Nobody else will have him.<br> You're welcome. So how does<br> it feel to be executive producer?<br> I gotta go.<br> Me too. Gotte go. We're very busy here.<br> It's the Gulf of Sidra.<br> The name of the US commander<br> is Nathan Benchley.<br> In the summer of 1981 two Libyan jets<br> suddenly attacked to American air...<br> The plan against Nathan<br> I don't really well...<br> ...nations including the US...<br> ...after a brief dogfight both Libyan jets<br> were down by the American fighters.<br> The name's Nathan Bencley.<br> ... is at the Pentagon.<br> So, -that's great. That's great-<br> commander, it must have been a bit tougher...<br> ...today, shooting down the Mig-21<br> The one you got was SU-22...<br> - What is it like... -<br> What is it like to be in a dog fight?<br> Ok, after this guy, we'll go for...<br> about ten seconds.<br> Ask him how does he know when he has a hit.<br> Dou you know you have a hit from one of<br> those screens inside your cockpit or...<br> That's good. That's good.<br> The equipment is very<br> sophisticated but the...<br> ...whole pilot point of view you like to see<br> it to conform it. Thank you commander.<br> It's always been considered<br> an outlaw nation but strangely...<br> ...some of those who have<br> interviewed Gaddafi find him,<br> ...in a phrase we like<br> to use in this country,<br> very'presidential'.<br> Nice, Jane.<br> Just a minute.<br> Then we gotta get Martin Klein<br> To State for the message from Libya,<br> ...then you'll have the carrier pilot<br> from the Sidra in time to...<br> What? No! You missed him!<br> We only have ten minutes left.<br> How can you talk to me<br> about parking problems?<br> No, not you'll try, you'll do it, do it or<br> I'll fry your fat ass, Estelle. Good-bye.<br> I had no idea she was this good.<br> Tom,<br> Fill for a second.<br> The latest message seems to<br> indicate that the Libyan pilot was...<br> ...acting on his own without<br> authority from anyone else.<br> In other words, I think we're all okay.<br> Ok Tom.<br> The Libyan Government has disavowed<br> any prior knowledge of the attack.<br> I'm Tom Grunick, reporting from Washington.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Animation.

Come on.<br> Don't go.<br> This is important to me.<br> I think it is important for you too.<br> Come on sit down.<br> Sit down.<br> What is this?<br> I'll take it.<br> What?<br> Give me one minute please.<br> This is tough.<br> Okay.<br> Let's take the part that<br> has nothing to do with me.<br> Let me just be your<br> most trusted friend now,<br> ...the one that gets to say<br> all the awful stuff ok?<br> I guess.<br> Yes.<br> You can't end up with Tom...<br> ...because it totally goes against<br> everything that you're about.<br> Yeah, being a basket case.<br> I know you care about him.<br> I've never seen you<br> like this with anybody, so...<br> ...don't get me wrong<br> when I tell you that Tom,<br> very nice guy...<br> ...is the Devil.<br> This isn't friendship.<br> You're crazy. You know that?<br> What do you think the job is<br> going to look like if he's around?<br> God.<br> Come on noone is going to be taken in<br> if he has a long, red, pointy tail.<br> Come on. What's it gonna sound like...<br> No.<br> I'm semi-serious here.<br> You're serious...<br> He will be attractive...<br> ...he will be nice and helpful...<br> ...he will get a job where he influences<br> a great God-fearing nation...<br> ...he'll never do an evil thing...<br> he'll never deliberately hurt a living thing<br> ...he'll just bit by little bit lower our<br> standards where they are important.<br> Just a tiny little bit.<br> Just coax along flash over substance...<br> Just a tiny little bit.<br> And he'll talk about<br> all of us really being salesmen.<br> And he'll get all the great women.<br> Hey you.<br> I think you're the Devil.<br> You know I'm not. -How?<br> Because I think we have the kind of<br> friendship where if I were the Devil,<br> ...you will be the only one I would tell.<br> Well you were quick enough to get<br> Tom's help when...<br> Yes.<br> I think if it's gone well for me tonight,<br> then I probably wouldn't say any of this.<br> I grant you everything...<br> ...but give me this...<br> ...he personifies everything that<br> you've been fighting against...<br> ...And I'm in love with you.<br> How do you like that?<br> I buried the lead.<br> I've got to not say that aloud;<br> it takes too much out of me.<br> I've never fought for anyone before.<br> Does anybody win one of these things?<br> Hello.<br> Hi.<br> Where are you?<br> I can't get away just yet.<br> I'm at Aaron's.<br> Well, when?<br> I'm not sure. It seems like he<br> had sort of a mishap on the news.<br> I know. I taped it.<br> Well, it wasn't as bad as he think, was it?<br> It wasn't unprecedented or anything?<br> Not if you count'Singing in the Rain. '<br> Do him a favor and don't treat it like a<br> tragedy. You want me to talk to him?<br> He says you could hardly notice it.<br> I'll talk to him.<br> Don't say anything about anything.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize<br> you two would be going this late. Sorry.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> I'll put her back on.<br> Hi again.<br> I'm sorry about this...<br> No.<br> Don't worry. That sounds more important.<br> Let's forget about tonight.<br> I don't know...<br> ...if that's absolutely necessary.<br> I've my father coming<br> through tomorrow anyway.<br> I should get some sleep.<br> I'll see you at the office.<br> Good night.<br> Hello?<br> Yes.<br> Okay. Good night.<br> Good night?<br> Jane, I'm not some chore you have<br> to finish so you can stay on schedule.<br> Okay, great, Grunick. Easy shots now huh?<br> Good night.<br> He just cancelled.<br> He had a chance to think and he cancelled.<br> I can't breathe.<br> Damn it!<br> Oh what a guy.<br> Well, Jane, thanks for stopping by.<br> Good night.<br> I kept trying to call you,<br> you never called me.<br> Were you just diddling me? s that it?<br> I'm great if I'm helping your career.<br> But when I'm a woman for a second,<br> I get immediately fucked around by you.<br> Jane, this is my Dad.<br> I'm very pleased to meet you sir.<br> Please forgive what I said.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You just light up a room and leave, huh?<br> You want my opinion?<br> The thing that's easy<br> to miss about Jane is...<br> You want my opinion?<br> And it's okay if you don't.<br> Yes, I would.<br> The way she just acted is not the<br> way an affectionate person acts.<br> Rorish.<br> Just when do you start, telling people?<br> Almost immediately.<br> I'd like to take everyone out after<br> the show. -Fantastic.<br> Hello Donny.<br> Bill, what a surprise.<br> Good to see you again.<br> Bill Rorich.<br> Bill, this is hard on all of us and...<br> ...no time for compliments.<br> But I think it's extraordinary of<br> you to come down here for this.<br> Well If we're not here for each other during<br> the tough time we're not a news organization<br> Bill.<br> Welcome back to Washington. Bill.<br> Well, thank you.<br> I've forget is she on the list?<br> This is a brutal layoff...<br> And all because they couldn't<br> program Wednesday nights.<br> You can make it a little less brutal...<br> by knocking a million dollars<br> or so off your salary.<br> A bad joke. I'm sorry. Awful.<br> It's a miserable day...<br> ...and that was just some kind of<br> sick-joke defense mechanism...<br> It just does not indicate<br> any of my feelings, not one...<br> ...but just shows the kind of<br> stress this represents for all of us.<br> Bill.<br> Tom. It's about time.<br> It's good to see you.<br> Thank you.<br> I feel terrible about what happened.<br> What did he say?<br> He said...<br> ...that he liked you...<br> ...because you looked like<br> you had fire and honesty.<br> No.<br> Did he really?<br> Yes.<br> What?<br> Paul canned me.<br> Well, my brother will feel great,<br> now he's not the only screw-up.<br> Tom, Paul wants to see you.<br> Ernie. -What?<br> They're calling from work.<br> Tell them I'm on the way in.<br> It's Paul.<br> He'll just be in a minute.<br> I hate this so much.<br> You know I'm just old enough to be<br> flattered by the term,'early retirement. '<br> That's wonderful. What a lovely line.<br> Now if there's anything I can do for you.<br> Well I certainly hope you die soon.<br> Tom.<br> This is a severe cutback, Tom.<br> including technical personnel...<br> ...and we're going to<br> reorganize at the same time.<br> We're going to drop you out of<br> Washington and assign you to London.<br> He knew that we're gonna offer<br> me this before ever when in there.<br> I can't stand this.<br> This is not... -We careful each<br> other too much to be dishonest...<br> ...so let me tell you the simple truth:<br> I'm leaving.<br> No matter who they replace me with here...<br> or they're gonna make me leave anywhere...<br> ...the fact that each you take some...<br> ...and I know you think<br> any better than I am.<br> Goddamn, no I'm not.<br> Oh my god. I'm gonna miss you.<br> Me too.<br> Have you guys seen Jane?<br> She's back there, getting my job.<br> The first woman bureau chief<br> we've ever had here.<br> What did they do with you?<br> They booted me out of Washington.<br> Impossible.<br> There's no system that<br> wouldn't value one of us.<br> Why? What did they do to you?<br> It's what he did.<br> I'm proud of him.<br> They told me they'd keep me...<br> ...because they could plug me into<br> any story and my salary was in line.<br> The cost-efficient reporter.<br> So I quit.<br> Jane, I gotta tell you something.<br> Yeah?<br> Except for socially.<br> You're my role model.<br> You packing up tonight?<br> I'm sorry that they're sending you down<br> but I'm sure you'll make it back.<br> Where are they sending you anyway?<br> London.<br> London?<br> Yeah.<br> That's a promotion!<br> I don't think so.<br> Yes, that's where they had Rorish,<br> for God's sake, before they made him anchor.<br> I can't believe you.<br> They're grooming you for it<br> all and you don't even know it.<br> Hold it down, will you?<br> Can I ask you something?<br> You only had one camera crew<br> on that date rape piece, right?<br> Yeah.<br> You're not going to stick<br> around for the farewell party?<br> No. I don't know how much fun<br> it's gonna be when Martin Klein...<br> ...and Ernie turn off their<br> credentials with the security guard.<br> Hi...<br> Can I speak to your wife?<br> No message at all,<br> I'I see you at home.<br> This is one story they are not gonna cover.<br> of course the network doesn't cover it<br> it must not be important so why worry.<br> I'm going to miss you.<br> You're a prick in a great way.<br> You know what I mean.<br> No, I liked the way it made me sound.<br> Okay. Be good. See you.<br> You figure out his hiring.<br> It's not... Donny.<br> Thank you, Jane.<br> Bye sweetie.<br> Good luck.<br> Oh sorry.<br> You know...<br> but I always wanted to tell you that...<br> ...this is the third cutback...<br> These people...<br> This also awful.<br> It just hurts physically, doesn't it?<br> Like something's wrong with your bones,<br> ...like your organs are<br> shifting inside your body.<br> Maybe I haven't been here long enough.<br> But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.<br> Congratulations? How can you say that to me?<br> I'm sorry I can't stand here<br> feeing bad because I don't feel worse.<br> This has happened<br> at every station I've ever been to.<br> Do they owe you any time off?<br> Fourteen weeks.<br> I think it's crazy for you to come in here<br> tomorrow morning and start a new job.<br> I have a week before after I get to my job.<br> Let's get the hell away<br> to some island fast and...<br> ...and find out how we are<br> together away from this.<br> Well, I just think...<br> ...that's an extraordinary proposal.<br> That's yes?<br> That's more than'yes'...<br> ...that's'you bet. '<br> Hello.<br> Bastard, sneak, quitter.<br> Speaking.<br> I just found out. You didn't say<br> anything to me? You just resign?<br> Will you meet me now?<br> Oh, no, I can't. Maybe next week...<br> No, I'm going away tomorrow. Please.<br> Alright, I meet you the place in...<br> Ok, I'll meet you there.<br> Anyway my agent has a hot prospect<br> the number two station in Portland.<br> The general manager there says he wants<br> to be every bit as good as the networks.<br> Personally, I think he should aim higher.<br> Tell me the God's honest truth...<br> ...are you leaving because of me?<br> Because if you are...<br> Ernie said you're lucky if you can<br> get out while you could still cry...<br> ...which means I should have quit this place<br> three years ago.<br> You're just trying to say all great stuff so<br> I'll feel even worse that you're not around.<br> Let's go.<br> I just want to sit here.<br> I mean the feeling stay here...<br> ...that's powerful.<br> Why is that?<br> Maybe the best part of your life is over and<br> you dont wanna get up and start the bad part<br> You are now required to sit here with me.<br> Come on.<br> ...be smart for a second...<br> What do you...<br> ...think will happen to us?<br> What will happen?<br> Okay, that's very easy.<br> Five, six years from now<br> I'll be in town to collect an award...<br> ...representing the surge in<br> foreign coverage by local stations.<br> What will they call you at work?<br> The...<br> Yes.<br> anyway I'll be walking with my wife<br> and two lovely children...<br> ...and we'll bump into you<br> ...and my youngest son will say something...<br> ...and I will tell him it's not nice<br> to make fun of single, fat ladies.<br> You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?<br> I hope so.<br> No. I'm not really mad.<br> I'll miss you, we'll talk,<br> we'll always be friends...<br> ...we'll get hot for each other every few<br> years at dinner and never act on it, okay?<br> I gotta go.<br> Jane.<br> Do you know how Tom had tears in his eyes<br> in that interview we did with that girl?<br> Ask yourself how we were able to see that...<br> ...when he only had one camera and that was<br> pointing at the girl during the interview.<br> I'm fairly sure I was right to tell you.<br> This whole thing just messed me up...<br> ...maybe more than it should have...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Stand up.<br> Are you okay?<br> Yes, I'm sorry.<br> Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?<br> The way you were looking at me, I just went.<br> Point just...<br> I just need a minute more of your time,<br> so we can shoot from behind you towards me,<br> and, um...<br> ...that way we have someplace to go when<br> we cut. And...<br> ...I sit here, I nod my head, I look nerdy.<br> It kills me we didn't get you on camera.<br> It was so powerful seeing your reaction.<br> Really?<br> For a second there,<br> I thought you were gonna cry yourself.<br> That would have been something.<br> Give me a minute...<br> Fucking...<br> Oh, it's amazing.<br> Could you tell me where we can catch a bus<br> to Washington? Thank you very much.<br> Look who's the organized one.<br> I've got everything.<br> I'm not going.<br> Why?<br> I saw the taped outtakes of the interview<br> with the girl. I know you...<br> ...acted your reaction after the interview.<br> It's verboten, huh?<br> I thought since<br> I almost did it the first time, but...<br> ...I get you.<br> That's not the reason you're not coming?<br> Of course it's the reason.<br> It's terrible what you did.<br> We disagree on how God-awful it was.<br> Why don't you come with me and we can<br> disagree and get a tan at the same time?<br> Jesus, if you're gonna be glib about this<br> I'm gonna lose it.<br> Jane, keep it down.<br> Jane...<br> I was up all night and...<br> It made me ill.<br> That's better.<br> You could get fired for things like that.<br> I got promoted for things like that.<br> Working up tears for a new piece cutaway.<br> You totally crossed the line between...<br> It's hard not to cross it; they keep<br> moving the little sucker, don't they?<br> It just proves that the difference we...<br> This is a one-way argument. We've got 6 days<br> ...if you go and we fight and<br> we hate it, we'll come home.<br> If you don't go? That's a much bigger deal.<br> I leave for London right after that.<br> So, it'd be very big deal if you stay...<br> The plane's boarding. You're<br> good at deadline. Here's your ticket.<br> It's amazing. You commit this incredible<br> breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nit...<br> I'm giving you a hard time about nothing<br> Try and get this.
