                        Thank you, thank you. Oh, if you<br> overate too much tonight...<br> I got a great song that the paesans<br> would understand. It's "Agita".<br> Uno, two!<br> Agita, my gumba, in the banzone<br> When I eat, he gets a<br> treat like a canzone<br> He enjoys every meal,<br> every bite that I steal<br> Agita, my gumba, in the banzone<br> Some people like their pizza,<br> some people like suffrite<br> And others like hot pepper<br> on everything they eat<br> You hunger with a vuole<br> to taste that bacala<br> Then all at once you think<br> "Will I answer to gumba?"<br> My lovely, lovely woman,<br> I hate to see her cry<br> But when I start to<br> mangia, I get the evil eye<br> My vuole's gettin' stronger,<br> ah, to hell with my gumba<br> Then I get it from my woman,<br> che de botts a na sciatta<br> Agita, my gumba, in the banzone<br> When I eat, he gets a<br> treat like a canzone<br> He enjoys every meal,<br> every bite that I steal<br> Agita, my gumba, in the banzone<br> We got to do Miami jokes. If you're<br> in Florida, you do Miami jokes.<br> Morty, I tried Miami jokes.<br> I don't know what works any more.<br> - Why? What happened?<br> - I got that big Miami joke that I do.<br> About the hotels being expensive<br> and how much it costs...<br> like $150 a day for a sleeping room,<br> and I said to the clerk "What's cheaper?"<br> He said "I got a room for $10,<br> but you make your own bed."<br> So he gave me a hammer and<br> some nails. That's the joke.<br> - It's a good joke. It works.<br> - Been workin' for years. Last night it died.<br> Really?<br> That audience sat there like<br> they were an oil painting.<br> I don't know why. Always<br> works when I do it.<br> You do that joke? Maybe<br> that's where I got it from.<br> When I broke into this<br> business in New York...<br> I could play at least 12 to 20 weeks<br> a year without leaving the city.<br> - There was the Latin Quarter...<br> - The China Doll.<br> - China Doll...<br> - Queen's Terrace.<br> - Played the Boulevard...<br> - What about Jersey? The Stagecoach...<br> - Lamplighters.<br> - Riviera, Bill Miller's.<br> Look how far you have to go. You went<br> to Washington. I went to Baltimore.<br> - You gotta have good tyres to work today.<br> - Or a good car.<br> The first impression I did,<br> I went to see The Seventh Veil.<br> I didn't want to become an impressionist.<br> I was trying to develop an English accent.<br> The idea of impersonating James Mason<br> was the furthest thing from my mind.<br> Out came this impression and I've<br> been doing impressions ever since.<br> - But this thing is all in the mask, right?<br> - And then I did Picasso for a few weeks.<br> You know the first time<br> I saw you do Mason?<br> It was backstage at the<br> Sullivan show. You were brilliant.<br> I was there with Danny Rose.<br> Remember Danny Rose?<br> He was handling an actor... the manager...<br> and a one-legged tap-dancer.<br> It was his normal handling. Danny<br> Rose. Yeah. Oh, he's the best.<br> May I say one word? Might I just<br> interject one concept at this juncture?<br> You're lookin' for somebody<br> for Memorial Day weekend.<br> My blind xylophone player, OK?<br> The man would be perfect for your room.<br> - Ah, forget it.<br> - Philly, will you please hear me out?<br> The man is a beautiful man.<br> He's a fantastic individual.<br> My hotel gets old Jewish<br> people. They're blind.<br> - They ain't gonna pay to see a blind guy.<br> - So forget that, then.<br> How about Herbie Jayson's birds?<br> Herbie Jayson's birds.<br> They're little birds. They peck tunes<br> out on a piano. It's a beautiful thing.<br> What about my one-legged tap-dancer?<br> Take him for a weekend.<br> - All right, my one-armed juggler.<br> - Not for my hotel!<br> All right, what about Lou Canova,<br> my Italian singer? He'd be great.<br> Lou Canova's a dumb, fat, temperamental<br> has-been with a drinking problem.<br> Jesus! What about Eddie Clark's penguin?<br> Eddie Clark and his penguin.<br> The penguin skates on the stage dressed<br> as a rabbi. It's hilarious. He's got a beard.<br> I'll tell you what, give me Sonny Chase.<br> He's the best act you got.<br> - He's fast, he's funny.<br> - I don't handle Sonny any more.<br> Since when?<br> It's a long story. I discovered the kid.<br> He slept on my sofa. I supported him.<br> I don't wanna bad-mouth the kid, but<br> he's a horrible, dishonest, immoral louse.<br> - And I say that with all due respect.<br> - I know, Danny.<br> - They get a little success and leave you.<br> - That's my point! Believe me, Philly...<br> if I had all the acts in this business that<br> I started that made it, I'd be a rich man.<br> I'd like to help, but Weinstein's Majestic<br> Bungalow Colony is a classy place.<br> - I need a classy act.<br> - I wanna show you this lady.<br> She is the Jascha Heifetz of this<br> instrument. She is something.<br> You gotta see this, Philly.<br> It's incredible.<br> Never took a lesson.<br> This is self-taught.<br> Next year, Philly, my hand to God,<br> she's gonna be at Carnegie Hall.<br> But you, I'll let you have her<br> now at the old price, OK?<br> Which is anything you wanna<br> give me, anything at all.<br> - I remember that woman.<br> - You have never seen acts like this.<br> This guy would work his<br> tail off for these acts.<br> If he believed in an act,<br> he would go all out.<br> Danny, my partner wants me to<br> open up with the dachshund...<br> but I think I should open up<br> with the swan or the giraffe.<br> The swan is pretty and it fascinates the<br> people. Or... have an animal of this type.<br> I think your partner's right. Open up with<br> the dachshund and build to the giraffe.<br> Close with the giraffe cos<br> it's got more impact.<br> Really?<br> If you take my advice, you'll be one of the<br> great balloon-folding acts of all time.<br> Cos I don't see you just folding<br> these balloons in joints.<br> You listen to me, you're gonna fold<br> these balloons at universities.<br> You're gonna make your snail<br> and your elephant on Broadway.<br> But the thing to remember is<br> before you go out on stage...<br> you gotta look in the mirror and<br> you gotta say your three S's:<br> Star, smile, strong.<br> Star, smile, strong.<br> - Danny used to be a performer.<br> - He was a comic.<br> He worked the Catskills. He did all the<br> old jokes and stole from everybody.<br> He was the kind of comic<br> you'd think he'd be.<br> God bless you, darling. Let me ask you a<br> question, sweetheart. How old are you?<br> - 81.<br> - 81 years old. Isn't that fantastic?<br> No, really. She's 81.<br> It's fantastic. I mean that.<br> Unbelievable. You don't look<br> a day over 80. No, I mean it.<br> I'm just kiddin'. I love you.<br> You're really beautiful.<br> What sign are you, darling?<br> - What?<br> - She says "What?" She's great.<br> But I drove up here today.<br> I love driving.<br> You run across so many interesting<br> people. I saw a terrible accident.<br> Two taxi cabs collided.<br> He stopped doing his act because he<br> was working the Catskill Mountains.<br> Nobody in the audience<br> is under 80 years old.<br> He's on stage, doing his act,<br> two people get heart attacks.<br> So naturally he became<br> a personal manager.<br> You can't do a good act, you<br> become a personal manager.<br> But his acts were so devoted.<br> They loved him.<br> Where you gonna find that<br> kind of devotion today?<br> The funniest Danny Rose story is the time<br> he's handling a hypnotist. A hypnotist.<br> He's got the guy working<br> the Catskill Mountains.<br> The hypnotist brings up this<br> Jewish lady and hypnotises her.<br> Tessie! Tessie!<br> - The body is warm. It's a good sign.<br> - Yes, that's a good sign.<br> Tessie! Tessie!<br> I promise you, if your wife<br> never wakes up again...<br> I will take you to any<br> restaurant of your choice, OK?<br> Do you like Chinese food?<br> All right, you finished? Excuse me.<br> Hold it, hold it. Are you finished?<br> Are you finished? Because I have<br> the greatest Danny Rose story.<br> Hold it now. Are you finished?<br> I have the greatest Danny<br> Rose story, all right?<br> You wanna do anything?<br> This is gonna take some time.<br> - Can I call home?<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Coffee.<br> - Are you ready?<br> We're gonna be here a while. This<br> is the greatest Danny Rose story.<br> - This is the one with Lou Canova.<br> - The tall guy, the singer? The Italian kid?<br> He was the kid that had<br> those semi-hit records?<br> He had a record, I think, called "Agita".<br> It was on the charts for about 15 minutes.<br> This is not during those 15 minutes.<br> This is 25 years later.<br> And Lou cannot get anybody to<br> handle him. The man's in trouble.<br> And the only one who believes<br> in him is Danny Rose.<br> And by now, you gotta remember,<br> Lou is a has-been...<br> he's got a big ego, a temperament<br> and a slight drinking problem...<br> and Danny has faith.<br> I like the looks of you<br> The lure of you<br> The sweet of you<br> The pure of you<br> The eyes<br> The nose<br> The mouth of you<br> The east, west, north<br> and the south of you<br> I'd like to gain<br> Complete control of you<br> And handle<br> Even the heart and soul of you<br> So love at least a<br> small percent of me, do<br> I do, I do, I do, I do<br> Cos I love all of you<br> I do, I do, I do, I do<br> I do, yeah<br> A third show? I thought<br> there was only two.<br> There's three on weekdays and<br> there's four on weekends.<br> Four?! Tell 'em I'll walk!<br> Four shows!<br> What do you mean? You can't. Lou,<br> we're not in a position yet to walk.<br> - And I use the word "yet".<br> - My hair's all screwed up.<br> Your hair is fine.<br> Did you do the three S's?<br> Yeah. Strong, smile, star. I know.<br> Every time, you tell me every time.<br> You should do<br> "My Funny Valentine"...<br> after great crooners from<br> the past who are deceased.<br> - Hi, Lou. I wanted to meet you.<br> - But I'm discouraged. I'm down.<br> Please. God bless you, darling.<br> Why are you discouraged?<br> You're magnificent.<br> I can't pay my alimony.<br> I'll waive my commissions till<br> we get rolling, that's all.<br> - How you gonna live? You gotta eat.<br> - Don't worry about me so much.<br> I got other acts. I think about you in<br> the long run, that's what I'm saying.<br> You're the kinda guy that will always<br> make a beautiful dollar in this business.<br> You're what I call a perennial. You<br> get better-looking as you get older.<br> That's true. When I'm singin', I can feel<br> the women mentally undressing me.<br> It's true.<br> OK, so Danny is everything to Lou. He<br> picks his songs, his arrangements.<br> He picks his shirts, his clothes. He<br> eats with him. They're inseparable.<br> Danny is his manager, his<br> friend, his father-confessor.<br> I wanna go across the street<br> and get one white rose.<br> You wanna get a white rose?<br> Why do you want a white rose?<br> - I met this chick.<br> - Oh, Lou. Don't tell me about it...<br> because you're gonna get<br> caught in a hotel room...<br> you're gonna wind up<br> paying three alimonies.<br> - No, no, no. This is a classy chick.<br> - I can imagine.<br> - She's one of these decorators.<br> - With all due respect, you got a wife.<br> - This is different. I'm in love.<br> - Oh, great.<br> The usual single white<br> rose for Tina Vitale.<br> And just the words<br> "I love you, my bambina."<br> Come here a minute. Lou, come here.<br> Just step into my office for a minute.<br> The usual single white rose?<br> How long has this been going on?<br> - For a while. I can keep a secret.<br> - You're keeping a secret from me?<br> I knew you'd get miffed about it,<br> you'd get bugged because of my wife.<br> But, Danny, Tina, she's beautiful.<br> - She's like a Madonna.<br> - I believe you.<br> - She knows you're married?<br> - I levelled with her.<br> So what kinda woman is she?<br> I tried to introduce you to her for a long<br> time, but I knew you wouldn't have it.<br> I've always tried to<br> teach you, Lou...<br> that sooner or later you're gonna have<br> to square yourself with the big guy.<br> Is that true? You're gonna<br> pay your dues someday.<br> You're a married man. Take my aunt<br> Rose, not a beautiful woman at all.<br> She looked like something you<br> buy in a live-bait store.<br> She had wisdom. She used to say "You<br> can't ride two horses with one behind."<br> So you see what I'm sayin'?<br> That's my point.<br> OK, now a little time passes.<br> Danny's still struggling with the various<br> bird acts and the blind xylophone player.<br> Suddenly the nostalgia craze<br> is starting to build.<br> And Danny finds he can<br> book Lou a little easier.<br> You may be king<br> You may possess the world<br> And all of its gold<br> Oh, but gold won't<br> bring you happiness<br> When you're growing old<br> Oh, the world,<br> it's still the same...<br> He's working these nostalgia cruises<br> and the audience is eating it up.<br> Suddenly an over-the-hill boy singer<br> is starting to get some attention.<br> They shine high above...<br> And I am very honoured to announce that<br> one of America's great singing legends...<br> a cherished musical legend, is<br> making part of his comeback...<br> on the Joe Franklin TV Show.<br> I hope my enthusiasm is<br> generating, cos I love this man.<br> I mean, if you can love a<br> man, I love Lou Canova. Lou.<br> - Thank you, Joe. You're very kind.<br> - I mean that. Are you sort of...<br> I've been on the show three,<br> four times and it just helps.<br> I mean, it helps everybody.<br> You're New York. What can I tell ya?<br> I always had the feeling that you were<br> never obsessed to be a superstar.<br> You were never driven<br> to be a superstar.<br> You just let it drift and<br> take its own course.<br> When I had a record out in the '50s,<br> it made some noise and everything...<br> and you start to get to feel as though<br> maybe you wanna be a bigger star.<br> It didn't really bother me. But now I'm<br> doin' cruise ships, I'm doin' bigger shows.<br> I feel great. It's a good<br> time in life to do it.<br> OK. Now, two days later, Danny runs<br> into Milton Berle on Broadway.<br> Milton is doing an NBC<br> special, a nostalgia show.<br> Plus he needs a singing act to<br> open for him at Caesar's Palace.<br> Danny convinces him to come and see<br> Lou on a club date at the Waldorf.<br> And if Milton likes Lou, he<br> gets the TV shot and Caesar's.<br> I mean, I love Milton.<br> He's a beautiful man.<br> - This is two years out of our guts.<br> - Don't be so nervous, Lou.<br> You gotta take him out Sunday and let<br> him relax. He's gonna be all wound up.<br> I'll open with "Volare" or<br> "You Make Me Feel So Young".<br> - How are you, darling?<br> - Good.<br> - How old are you?<br> - 12.<br> - Are you married?<br> - No.<br> Fantastic fettucine.<br> Do "My Funny Valentine" with the<br> special lyrics about the moon landing.<br> Maybe we oughta put on a<br> press agent for that week.<br> I've been gettin' your name<br> in the columns pretty good.<br> It's not like havin' a steady<br> press agent. You know, steady.<br> Take him to a movie or he's<br> gonna be a wreck by showtime.<br> Great idea for a TV show. Mr Televisin<br> looks at the stars of the '50s.<br> Beautiful!<br> That week Danny devotes<br> to Lou exclusively.<br> They go over the running<br> order of his act 15 times...<br> what colour shirts to wear, his weight...<br> he wants Lou to lose some pounds.<br> I don't know who's more<br> nervous, Lou or Danny.<br> Meanwhile, his other clients are starting<br> to complain about their own problems.<br> I couldn't get your service. I had a crisis.<br> A cat ate one of my birds.<br> I cancelled the show and<br> Ralph doesn't wanna pay.<br> What do you mean,<br> you don't wanna pay?<br> A cat ate his bird. That comes<br> under the act-of-God clause.<br> - He gets paid if he does his show only.<br> - It was a lead bird.<br> Remember Pee Wee, used to<br> peck "September Song"?<br> Pee Wee's gone? Pee...<br> Ralph, what are you doin'?<br> Pee Wee has now been eaten by a feline.<br> Pee Wee gave us many a laugh and tear.<br> Danny, I don't pay no<br> birds that don't work.<br> - Where were you when I needed you?<br> - Yeah, where were you?<br> I admit, it's my fault.<br> I've been remiss lately.<br> I've been very busy with another client.<br> After Sunday night you'll have me.<br> I'll be yours exclusively.<br> I know how you feel.<br> Pee Wee was the son he never<br> had, so it's, you know...<br> I promise, after Sunday<br> night, really, I'm with you.<br> One, two.<br> I want you to open with "You're<br> Nobody Till Somebody Loves You".<br> And then go into "My Bambina"...<br> and after that do great crooners<br> from the past who are now deceased.<br> - And then "Agita" if you want.<br> - Would you do me a favour tomorrow?<br> - You name it, you got it.<br> - I want you to bring Tina.<br> - Who's Tina?<br> - I told you about Tina.<br> - I'm really crazy about her.<br> - I thought I talked you outta that.<br> It's no use. I'm like a little kid. I'm still<br> sendin' her a white rose every day.<br> Don't we have enough on our mind?<br> She's been lucky for me from the first day<br> I met her. Good things started happenin'.<br> Yeah, but Teresa's gonna be there.<br> You're gonna get in a lot of trouble.<br> That's why you gotta bring her.<br> You be the beard.<br> What? I don't wanna be a beard.<br> Come on. I'm tellin' ya, I'll<br> do a great job if she's there.<br> - Without her I'm gonna be lost.<br> - Since when? This is business.<br> Why are you makin' such a big deal?<br> Terry goes home, then I'll<br> take her off your hands.<br> When there's people<br> around, she's with you.<br> No, it's not nice. You're gonna<br> wind up in alimony jail.<br> - I can't function without her. I'm lost.<br> - Since when?<br> Why does she have<br> such a hold on you?<br> I don't know what it is about<br> this woman. I love her.<br> - Maybe it's a whole mother thing.<br> - Your mother's alive. Let me take her.<br> She gives me confidence. I love her.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> I'm scared enough as it is.<br> Jesus, Lou, is this more<br> serious than I thought?<br> I haven't had a night's sleep trying to<br> figure out what to do with my life, OK?<br> So all of a sudden<br> I gotta be the beard?<br> I want her there. I gotta know she's<br> there and I gotta know she loves me.<br> I can only say, as your friend and your<br> manager, you're a sick individual...<br> but if that's what you want,<br> all right, we'll do it.<br> Tina? Danny Rose. Had no trouble<br> getting here at all. None at all.<br> Are you ready?<br> Cos I'm double-parked.<br> Lou, you can drop dead! That's<br> what you been sayin' for months!<br> Yeah, well, I don't buy it and I'm damn<br> sick and tired of all your stories!<br> Don't tell me that, Lou. Bein' married's one<br> thing, but two-timing's somethin' else!<br> Well, that's just a bunch of garbage. I<br> don't buy it and you better watch yourself!<br> I don't care how important it is!<br> It's too damn bad if you're upset.<br> The way you treat me, you're lucky I don't<br> stick an ice pick in your goddamn chest!<br> Like hell I'll be there!<br> You know what you can do!<br> Goddamn phoney.<br> - Lou tells me you're an interior decorator.<br> - I don't wanna hear Lou's name.<br> I don't want a run-around.<br> I don't want any crap, goddamnit!<br> Darling, sweetheart, darling...<br> might I interject one notion at<br> this juncture? How old are you?<br> - None of your goddamn business!<br> - I'm serious, darling. You're upset.<br> - What sign are you? Gemini?<br> - Shut up! Will you just shut up?<br> May I make one statement?<br> My father... may he rest in peace...<br> would say maturity, tolerance...<br> a willingness to give, that's all.<br> Look, it's a big night for Lou.<br> Don't ruin it for him.<br> - I don't wanna talk to that creep.<br> - What happened?<br> - Go to hell!<br> - May I make one statement?<br> - I don't mean to be didactic.<br> - What are you talkin' about?<br> The man's crazy about you.<br> He's nuts for you.<br> I got friends who told me he was out<br> last night with a cheap blonde.<br> A cheap blonde? Lou? A cheap blonde?<br> Would he fall for a cheap blonde?<br> - I... You know, the man has class.<br> - Yeah, I thought so too.<br> Yes, of course. Sweetheart, I promise<br> you, he's cheating with you.<br> He's got integrity. He cheats with one<br> person at a time only. That's his style.<br> My friends told me he was at the track last<br> night with his arm around a cheap blonde.<br> Because they bother him cos he's cute.<br> They try and grab, he pushes them away.<br> When he pushes them away,<br> his arm goes around.<br> Knock it off. You think I buy that?<br> His wife is a blonde. She's not cheap.<br> A lovely woman. Educated.<br> She's a cocktail waitress. And they don't<br> all hustle, no matter what you say.<br> - What the hell do you want?<br> - Don't upset him.<br> - I'm not coming. You got that? Drop dead!<br> - I wanna speak to him.<br> Hello? Lou? Lou, yes. Lou, it's me.<br> I got here OK, Lou. The directions<br> were good. It was a Gulf station.<br> Lou, she seems to<br> be a little upset.<br> Tina! Tina! Hey, Tina!<br> - Will you get lost?<br> - Where you going?<br> I got other things on my<br> mind besides two-timers.<br> No, the man adores you.<br> The man is crazy about you.<br> - He wants you ringside.<br> - What the hell did you come so early for?<br> I come every place early.<br> - You're hours early.<br> - I know, cos tonight's a big night.<br> Milton is coming tonight.<br> Remember Milton, Tuesday nights?<br> He'd come out in a woman's<br> dress. Remember?<br> If I'm so important to him,<br> why does he two-time me?<br> You got it wrong. You got it wrong,<br> sweetheart. Women annoy him.<br> He sings and they<br> mentally undress him.<br> I see an adventure.<br> Yes, a trip.<br> A man in a grey suit, who owns<br> a dog, will come to see you.<br> - That's Tommy.<br> - Tommy?<br> - When is he coming?<br> - Very soon. When you least expect it.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Shh!<br> - At least call Lou. Call Lou.<br> - No. Will you just get outta here?<br> The man is nervous. I know<br> he doesn't seem so, but...<br> - She wants to get ahead.<br> - Well, you know, I've been waiting.<br> - My nephew's ill.<br> - He's ill?<br> - Yeah, and he has a lump on his neck.<br> - A lump on his neck? That's terrible.<br> God bless you, sweetheart.<br> How old are you?<br> - 78.<br> - You're 78 years old? That's wonderful.<br> - What are your hobbies?<br> - Fish.<br> - Tropical fish?<br> - Tropical fish.<br> My uncle Menachem, may he rest in peace,<br> a wonderful man, raised hamsters.<br> I personally found 'em disgusting,<br> but the man adored them.<br> Like you probably feel about<br> your whatever, your guppies.<br> These are wonderful people, of your<br> persuasion. Lou is of your persuasion.<br> - Lou's a liar.<br> - He loves you like a mother.<br> - Excuse me. Come on in.<br> - That crap about his bad marriage.<br> The man loves her like<br> a mother. He adores her.<br> - I have a lover who I think is unfaithful.<br> - Angelina, might I interject one concept?<br> He is unfaithful. And<br> yet he cares for you.<br> See? He cares for you.<br> God bless you, God bless you.<br> - Don't go to him.<br> - I won't.<br> - Time out.<br> - See friends.<br> Resolve all situations, even if it<br> means travelling long distances.<br> - But be careful.<br> - Where you going? Tina!<br> Lou, we're into a definite<br> type of situation here.<br> No. Definitely, Lou.<br> Lou, definitely.<br> We're... Lou, we're into a<br> complete type of situation.<br> This is a complete definite<br> type of situation.<br> Why's she so mad at me?<br> What did I do?<br> Won't she even speak to me?<br> - I need a drink.<br> - Lou, Lou, don't get the jitters.<br> You get nervous, your performance<br> goes right into the toilet.<br> You start drinking... Lou,<br> I'll get her there, I promise.<br> Just let me work out the logistics.<br> Tina! Tina!<br> Tina!<br> And now it's the big day and<br> things are starting to go wrong.<br> - Lou is boozing a bit.<br> - I remember him with the Cutty Sark.<br> - Now, she splits. She splits.<br> - The girlfriend?<br> And Danny follows.<br> She drives and she drives<br> way the hell out somewhere.<br> Danny's right on her heels,<br> but you know how Danny drives.<br> She winds up an hour<br> later God knows where.<br> She's taking Angelina the<br> fortune-teller's advice.<br> She's winding up some<br> business with old friends.<br> - Tina, we didn't think you were coming.<br> - Hi, guys. You look handsome!<br> Yeah, well, I had a<br> change in plans.<br> Great. OK, the party can begin.<br> - Can we help you, sir?<br> - I'm with Tina. I'm a friend of Tina's.<br> God bless you. Stay where you are.<br> You're doing an aces job.<br> I'll check back with<br> you on my way out.<br> - I'll leave something nice for you.<br> - All right.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm here with Tina.<br> - I'm her uncle. Rocco.<br> - Danny Rose.<br> - What do you do?<br> - Theatrical management.<br> - What are you lookin' for?<br> - Tina.<br> Relax. You gotta be<br> around her every second?<br> - What do you do, Rocco?<br> - Cement.<br> - Cement?<br> - I own a fleet of cement mixers.<br> No kidding? Isn't that a very<br> big organised cr...? Cement.<br> That's fantastic. You always need cement.<br> That's what's great about cement.<br> - It's not like tape recorders...<br> - Annie, this is Tina's new boyfriend.<br> Hello. How long you been<br> going out with my niece?<br> - No, we don't go out. We're just friends.<br> - Yeah. I know Tina.<br> - Vinnie! Danny's in show business.<br> - I'm just a friend.<br> - He's a manager.<br> - You know Jackie Whalen?<br> - Yeah, he's a comedian. He's very funny.<br> - I don't think he's funny. I think he's dirty.<br> Today everything is, with the<br> pornography, all the four-letter words.<br> - It's all filthy.<br> - I saw this guy in Atlantic City.<br> He had a cigar box.<br> And he cuts a hole in it.<br> Then he goes backstage, he opens<br> up his fly and he sticks his thing in it.<br> Then he goes outside, down to ringside to<br> some old lady's table, opens up the box.<br> - That's humour?<br> - They call me old-fashioned...<br> but if it's old-fashioned to like Mr Danny<br> Kaye, Mr Bob Hope, Mr Milton Berle...<br> then all right,<br> then I'm old-fashioned.<br> - Tina, can't we discuss it?<br> - No, we discussed it a hundred times.<br> - Then why did you come here today?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I guess I shouldn't have.<br> - Tina, I love you.<br> - No. No, it's over.<br> - If I thought that, I'd kill myself.<br> - Johnny, don't talk like that.<br> - And you know I'd do it, too.<br> - You're too emotional.<br> - I wrote you a poem.<br> I shouldn't have come.<br> I'm too mixed up myself.<br> - It's about our month in Sicily.<br> - Can't you forget it?<br> We strolled on cliffs of stone<br> Like Greeks of ancient times.<br> Your hair blew this way and that<br> Mixed with bits of sand.<br> Our eyes met<br> And then looked out toward the sea<br> - The blue Aegean.<br> - Tina...<br> - We laughed and...<br> - What are you doin' here?<br> - I know what you're thinking. Pushy?<br> - I'm readin' a poem.<br> I'm sorry. I came to get you.<br> I wanna know what<br> you're doing here.<br> - I want you to come with me.<br> - Who are you?<br> Danny Rose, theatrical management.<br> Might I get five minutes with the lady?<br> Listen, you know I'm dying to come to the<br> Waldorf. But I've been hurt, that's all.<br> So this is who's been sending you the<br> single white rose every day? Danny Rose.<br> How do you know about<br> the white roses?<br> Believe me, I know more about<br> you than you think I know.<br> - Might I interject...?<br> - You know because you spy on me.<br> It's not spying when you care about<br> someone, what's happening to them.<br> Yeah, you check my mailbox in my<br> apartment when I'm not there. Admit it.<br> So you prefer him with his white roses<br> to me and all we were to each other?<br> I prefer someone that has<br> respect for me and doesn't spy!<br> Are you going with him?<br> Tina, can I get one...? Tina.<br> - What are you doing with money?<br> - Are you a big shot, tearing your money?<br> I been tearing money since<br> my first Holy Communion.<br> See this? 10 dollars. I don't care.<br> - Here. What does it mean?<br> - 20, 20.<br> What does it mean, you know?<br> It means nothin'.<br> Mere fascination, that's all it is.<br> Yeah, I wanna see Lou,<br> but he treats me lousy.<br> Well, Lou's crazy about you.<br> I'm telling you.<br> Tonight's a big shot<br> for him, really.<br> Lou's not a kid. He's<br> trying to make a comeback.<br> When he sings "That's Amore",<br> that for me is the end.<br> Isn't it unbelievable what he does<br> with that song? Isn't that fantastic?<br> I'm gonna hit you with one word. I'm<br> gonna say just one word. Sorrento. OK?<br> Sorrento. Am I lying?<br> I like it when he takes the microphone off<br> the stand and starts to sort of throw it.<br> - That's my gesture. I gave him that.<br> - No. I saw him years ago.<br> - He took the microphone off.<br> - But he didn't throw it from hand to hand.<br> I gave him that touch.<br> I used to do that.<br> So you taught him to throw the<br> microphone from hand to hand.<br> I taught him everything.<br> I gave him his gestures...<br> I handle his budget, I pick<br> his clothes, his songs.<br> And you manage his love life.<br> My father... may he rest in peace... said<br> "In business, friendly but not familiar."<br> But what am I gonna do? This is personal<br> management. It's a key word. Personal.<br> So, you know, I gotta get involved.<br> Like Herbie Jayson, my bird act.<br> A cat ate the lead bird. So I gotta<br> leap right into the breach, you know.<br> Or my Puerto Rican ventriloquist.<br> He's got everything you need to make<br> it big, but he's a dope addict.<br> - So I gotta get in there and help.<br> - What can I say?<br> Now that I see you, I'm the<br> wrong guy to be the beard.<br> Who'd believe that such a<br> beautiful girl would date me?<br> - Come on.<br> - No, I'm telling the truth.<br> - My hand to God.<br> - I'm not beautiful.<br> I see a lot of singers<br> and actresses. You are.<br> - Well, you're not so terrible.<br> - Yeah. I know one thing, honey.<br> I'm never gonna be Cary Grant,<br> I don't care what anybody says.<br> Can I get a sip of that?<br> Can I tell you a secret? I'm not just<br> trying to make you feel good or anything.<br> Yeah.<br> A handsome man never did anything<br> for me. You know what turns me on?<br> Intellectual. I'm not just saying this<br> to make you feel good or anything.<br> You're a smooth talker. Angelina once<br> even predicted I would marry a Jew.<br> - Did she happen to say which Jew?<br> - A Jew or someone musical.<br> Listen, now we're talking about something<br> musical, could you go call Lou?<br> Cos the guy needs you.<br> Give him a call.<br> Cos it's late. We'll get right outta<br> here. Please. Please, darling.<br> No, Lou. No, it's not<br> that I hate you.<br> It's just that, you know,<br> you get me angry sometimes.<br> Yeah. I'm gonna... I was always<br> gonna be there. I'll be there.<br> Will you listen to me?<br> I'm coming, OK?<br> It's just that sometimes<br> you get me crazy.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Oh, my God. Look!<br> It's him! She betrayed me with him.<br> Danny Rose!<br> Oh, my God! He drank iodine!<br> He seduced her away from me!<br> Were you seeing Tina while<br> she was going with Johnny?<br> Would I do something like that? No!<br> Then who sent the white<br> roses, one every day?<br> Johnny! Johnny, what happened?<br> What happened? Tell Mommy.<br> My son is sensitive. He's a poet.<br> un poeta, figlio mo.<br> He's fantastic.<br> How old are you, Johnny?<br> - He's 40.<br> - He's 40. Unbelievable. Are you an Aries?<br> - Just tell me, are you an Aries?<br> - Johnny's been made a fool out of.<br> No! No!<br> They forced him to wear the horns!<br> Le corna, capite?<br> We were engaged until<br> he put a spell on her!<br> You know, this man's a beautiful man.<br> He is a fantastic individual.<br> Vendetta! Vendetta!<br> Lo giuro davanti all madonna,<br> Johnny, lo giura mamma tua.<br> Boy, that guy Johnny must have<br> really been crazy about you.<br> I like to flirt, you know. Sometimes<br> people take it too seriously.<br> Johnny's all right. He was really nice<br> to me when my marriage fell apart.<br> And what did your husband do?<br> A little bookmaking, some<br> loansharking, extortion, like that.<br> So he's a professional man. You divorced<br> him or you got a separation or what?<br> Some guy shot him in the eyes.<br> - Really? He's blind?<br> - Dead.<br> He's dead, of course, cos the<br> bullets go right through.<br> Oh, my God, you poor thing.<br> It must have been a shock.<br> - He had it coming.<br> - Oh, I see.<br> It was one of those.<br> A close marriage.<br> It was exciting. You never knew<br> what was gonna happen next.<br> That kind of excitement<br> I can live without.<br> He was tough, good-looking.<br> - What did he tell you he did?<br> - Juice man for the Mob.<br> - He made juice for the Mob?<br> - Juice man.<br> No. He collected for<br> the loan sharks.<br> OK, so now Danny's driving along<br> with Tina. They're talking.<br> What they don't know is after<br> they left the party...<br> there was this scene with Johnny<br> Rispoli's brothers, Joe and Vito...<br> who are both hit men for the Mob.<br> Their mother is outraged<br> and humiliated...<br> over what's been goin' on with Danny<br> Rose, who they call Danny White Roses.<br> Don't worry, Mama. You<br> just leave him to us.<br> Your brother is soft.<br> He's sensitive.<br> Her husband had no respect for us either.<br> Carmine Vitale, he was no damn good.<br> He cheated us. And she's no better.<br> She said one thing to my<br> face and she betrayed me.<br> It's the lover. He's got her<br> under his spell, Johnny.<br> - We'll fix him.<br> - We'll chop his legs off.<br> No. We'll kill him.<br> I don't trust him.<br> But not Tina. Please, not Tina.<br> Get rid of the lover. Get rid of<br> the lover and you get her back.<br> He's got the evil eye.<br> C'ha il malocchio. You understand,<br> figlio mo? Il malocchio.<br> Mama, he's a dead man.<br> - I'll just have an iced coffee.<br> - I'm gonna have a glass of milk. Large.<br> I got an ulcer. I shouldn't have drank<br> at the party. That was my mistake.<br> My ex-husband had an ulcer.<br> They say it's stress. It's an<br> entire mental syndrome.<br> Yeah. Carmine was always afraid they<br> were gonna shoot him in the back.<br> He was wrong, so...<br> So who else have you<br> handled besides Lou?<br> Me? I got... I got... I have<br> various interesting artists.<br> I got a very wonderful blind xylophone<br> player, you know, that's...<br> I got a... I'm currently working with<br> a parrot that sings "I Gotta Be Me".<br> And I got some very nice balloon-folders,<br> you know. It's interesting.<br> No big shots, right?<br> I don't know. I've discovered certain<br> artists that have gone on to better things.<br> Yeah, but they all<br> leave you, right? How come?<br> I got a theory about that,<br> you know. Thank you.<br> I think what happens is they get a<br> swellhead, you know what I mean?<br> People like to forget their<br> beginnings and they just split.<br> You must be doin' somethin'<br> wrong if everybody leaves you.<br> How? What am I doing wrong?<br> I find 'em, I discover 'em, I breathe<br> life into 'em and then they go.<br> And no guilt. They don't feel guilty<br> or anything. They just split.<br> Guilty? What the hell is that? They see<br> somethin' better and they grab it.<br> - Who's got time for guilt?<br> - Guilt is important.<br> It's important to feel guilty, otherwise<br> you're capable of terrible things.<br> It's very important to be guilty. I'm guilty<br> all the time and I never did anything.<br> My rabbi, Rabbi Peristein, used to say<br> we're all guilty in the eyes of God.<br> - You believe in God?<br> - No. But I'm guilty over it.<br> I never feel guilty. I just think you<br> gotta do what you gotta do, you know.<br> Life's short. You don't get any<br> medals for bein' a boy scout.<br> Well, do me a favour, darling.<br> Don't give this information to Lou.<br> - I got enough problems.<br> - Don't move.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Just get up slowly and get outta here.<br> - I don't understand? What's out there?<br> - Johnny's brothers.<br> - You mean the guy with the iodine?<br> - They're crazy, that whole family.<br> - Why? Because they think I'm your lover?<br> - They'll tear the tongue outta your head.<br> I'm just a beard. They'll tear<br> the tongue outta the beard?<br> Throw some money down. Let's go.<br> - What do you mean? I only got 10 bucks.<br> - Leave it.<br> - Just leave it. Come on, will ya?<br> - The check is a dollar and a half.<br> - An eight-and-a-half-dollar tip.<br> - There oughta be a delivery entrance.<br> For that kind of dough I could get<br> the waitress to sleep with me.<br> Where's the...? There it is!<br> Don't get up. Keep turning<br> out the junk food.<br> - Come on! This way.<br> - I don't like this.<br> Darling, darling, may I interject one<br> statement? I don't like what's going on.<br> - Oh, Christ! Better go down there.<br> - What the hell did you get me into?<br> Do what I'm telling you.<br> You'll wind up on a meat hook.<br> A meat hook? A meat hook?<br> OK. I'll go first.<br> - I'm angry. I'm telling you, I'm angry.<br> - Hurry up and get down.<br> I'm really fuming.<br> Just feel free to dig your<br> heel into my groin like that.<br> So Danny and Tina, they run.<br> What's he gonna do? Now he is not<br> only scared. The man is pissed off.<br> - Sure. Because he didn't do anything.<br> - You got it.<br> Wait, wait, wait. Cut to a half-hour later.<br> It's a half-hour later. Now they're lost.<br> They're lost. And he's furious.<br> He's getting on her nerves.<br> She's getting on his nerves.<br> - Jesus! Where the hell are we?<br> - All right, take it easy.<br> Don't tell me to take it easy, because<br> I've had enough already today.<br> I'm a personal manager. I got<br> a big night ahead of me.<br> Meanwhile I'm wandering<br> around here in North Vietnam.<br> - We got away, didn't we?<br> - I got nothing to get away from.<br> I didn't do anything.<br> I'm running all of a sudden with<br> fortune-tellers and meat hooks.<br> I'll take care of it<br> when we hit a phone.<br> A phone? We're in a swamp, darling.<br> Where is there gonna be a phone here?<br> She's with Lou and they<br> wanna break my legs.<br> - I don't have to go tonight.<br> - Well, that's fine with me.<br> Then don't, because I'm too<br> scared already anyhow.<br> Lou, I wish you wouldn't drink like that.<br> You've got an important show tonight.<br> I got a cold sore tonight.<br> Look at this thing over here.<br> - It's nothing.<br> - It's gotta be tonight. Believe you me.<br> And those TV people, they notice<br> everything. They're pros.<br> - They got it down to a science.<br> - Turn on the ball game.<br> I can't even decide whether to go<br> with "Boulevard of Broken Dreams"...<br> or "Three Coins in the<br> Fountain" as an encore.<br> The kids are driving me nuts over<br> here. Give me a break over here.<br> I wonder where Danny is. I'm waiting<br> for his call. I got a million questions.<br> - Where is Danny?<br> - Went to pick up his date in Jersey.<br> I guess they probably<br> got tied up in traffic.<br> - Who's his date?<br> - How do I know? Some broad.<br> - Jesus. We're in the middle of nowhere.<br> - I never saw so many reeds in my life.<br> - I feel like Moses.<br> - Lou's probably worried sick.<br> Lou is probably drinking out of the<br> promotional-size whisky bottle by now.<br> Hey, wait a minute. I know where<br> we are. These are the flatlands.<br> My husband's friends used<br> to dump bodies here.<br> Great. I'm sure you can show me all<br> the points of cultural interest.<br> Hey, who are you?<br> Who are you?<br> - Who are you?<br> - We're lost.<br> We're shooting a commercial<br> down by the river.<br> Fantastic! Unbelievable!<br> What a break! I'm Danny Rose,<br> theatrical management. God bless you.<br> - This is Tina...<br> - Vitale.<br> Hi. I'm Ray Webb, the actor.<br> How you doin', babe?<br> Listen, we gotta get a car.<br> Is it possible?<br> - There are no cars out here till tonight.<br> - We need one now. It's an emergency.<br> I'm a theatrical manager, so I gotta see<br> Berle at the Waldorf later. Milton Berle.<br> There's a guy there with a boat. Give him<br> a couple of bucks. He'll take you across.<br> - Great, great.<br> - I don't travel by water.<br> It's against my religion.<br> I'm a landlocked Hebrew.<br> You ever seen me on TV? I play the<br> shaving-cream man from outer space.<br> - Wanna feel my cheeks, huh?<br> - Funny.<br> Come on, Danny. We gotta take<br> this boat. Lou's waitin'. Come on.<br> Five minutes across<br> the Hudson. It's nothin'.<br> You want me to go on the<br> Hudson River? That's crazy!<br> How did you two get out<br> here without a car?<br> I've been through thick<br> and thin with that car.<br> - Now I gotta leave it overnight?<br> - Pick it up tomorrow. It'll be fine.<br> If anything happens to that car, I'll<br> be furious, Tina. I will be furious.<br> OK. Now they're gonna go<br> back to Manhattan by boat.<br> A boat, mind you.<br> Can you picture Danny Rose on a boat?<br> I mean, this guy is strictly pavement.<br> He needs the smell of carbon<br> monoxide and litter to feel good.<br> Danny is not meant for water.<br> So, naturally, the minute he<br> steps on the boat, he's gone.<br> A lunch he ate in 1956 is<br> beginning to come up on him.<br> He's green. He's dizzy.<br> Tina's fine. She's made of steel. I'll<br> tell you what's going through her mind.<br> She's thinking of a conversation<br> that she and Lou had a week before.<br> - Hey, hey! All right!<br> - Listen, Lou...<br> I don't want you to break up with<br> your wife because of me. I don't...<br> Tina, it's not you. This<br> has been on my mind.<br> I'd feel like a home-wrecker.<br> That's what I feel like.<br> I gotta change my whole lifestyle.<br> The thing you gotta change<br> is your management.<br> Listen, Danny's all right. So he's no<br> world-beater. I mean, he's all right.<br> I know nothin' about show business.<br> And I got nothin' against the guy...<br> but I see the joints you work<br> and the way things are going.<br> You're better than<br> all these new guys.<br> - You're prejudiced cos you like me.<br> - Yeah, sure I am.<br> Listen, Danny'd be lost<br> without me. He's countin' on me.<br> You know what you're doin'.<br> Why don't you let me introduce<br> you to Sid Bacharach?<br> How do you know him? Why<br> would he give me his time?<br> He was good friends with my husband. They<br> were both very tight in Atlantic City.<br> - Sid Bacharach, huh?<br> - He's a big guy, right?<br> Big gun, big gun.<br> No two ways about it.<br> OK. Now they're in the<br> middle of the Hudson River.<br> The fog has come in. Danny's face is...<br> what colour should I say?<br> It's khaki. The man<br> has a khaki face.<br> So Tina wanted Lou to leave Danny<br> and go with Sid Bacharach?<br> That's exactly what I'm saying.<br> See, three days earlier...<br> Tina had set up a secret lunch meeting<br> at some steak joint in Manhattan.<br> Well, guys, we finally made it.<br> Lou Canova, Sid Bacharach.<br> - Sid, this is Lou.<br> - A pleasure, Mr Bacharach. Truly.<br> I've only heard wonderful<br> things about you from Tina.<br> - She does that all the time.<br> - No. You remember Lou from the '50s.<br> - He's got it.<br> - I remember "Tossin' and Turnin'".<br> That thing on "Perfidia" too.<br> Now I understand you already<br> have representation.<br> He's loyal to a guy who means well<br> but he can't seem to move him.<br> I know all about those things...<br> and sometimes it just doesn't<br> work out and he can't help you.<br> It's my career. It's my life.<br> I gotta do what's right for it.<br> I really wanna catch your act. I know this<br> nostalgia thing is really coming on strong.<br> - He's hot now.<br> - I'm gonna be at the Waldorf on the 25th.<br> come, Sid. He's ready.<br> All he needs is somebody with a<br> little clout to open some doors.<br> I'll do my best to make<br> it on Sunday night.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> I'll get you in the back.<br> - You won't regret it.<br> - No problem.<br> OK. So Tina's thinking about all this stuff<br> while they're sailing across the Hudson.<br> Meanwhile, the two crazy brothers are<br> in New York looking to kill Danny.<br> Wasn't Tina gonna make a phone<br> call and have 'em called off?<br> She did, the minute they got<br> ashore, but it didn't work.<br> - So what's happening?<br> - You're gonna have to lay low for a while.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - You got any friends outta town?<br> - Outta town? Like where? Are you nuts?<br> - You better check into a hotel.<br> You were gonna settle<br> this with one phone call.<br> It's gonna take a few days.<br> Meanwhile, they're looking for you.<br> Darling, can I say one thing?<br> I'm going to the police.<br> No, that's a mistake.<br> You gotta lay low.<br> Lay low? I didn't do anything! My whole<br> life I never got involved in any trouble.<br> I eat the right foods. Now I gotta lay low?<br> Jesus! You said one phone call.<br> I know. It's gonna be taken care of.<br> I got someone onto it.<br> - My advice is to check into a hotel.<br> - I got an apartment.<br> - Why do I need a hotel?<br> - You can't go back there for a few days.<br> I'm gonna spend for a hotel while<br> I'm carrying an apartment?<br> All right, it's a mix-up.<br> Just don't go home, that's all.<br> I gotta go home. You know,<br> you're bad news, honey.<br> I knew that when you were starting<br> with the ice pick on Lou.<br> Nice girls don't screw<br> around with ice picks.<br> - Just don't go home.<br> - I gotta go home.<br> I gotta get my pills and my shorts. And<br> Lou, the poor guy, he's probably a wreck.<br> I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk.<br> I mean, I'm OK.<br> I'm gonna be all right.<br> Now where you been?<br> I'm goin' crazy. Where's Tina?<br> Lou, Lou, take some black coffee and<br> get over to the Waldorf. She's here.<br> You speak to him, cos he's lost.<br> He's gone already.<br> Lou, I'll be there, honey.<br> Just do what Danny says.<br> - Be nice to him.<br> - We'll meet you at the place.<br> Of course I miss you. But will you<br> lay off the sauce? All right.<br> He's drunk. I knew<br> this was gonna happen.<br> Where are my pills? I need a<br> Valium the size of a hockey puck.<br> - Who's this? Who is this here?<br> - What do you mean? That's Frank.<br> Frank, Tony Bennett and me.<br> This was a big night.<br> See me up there? A little tiny smudge<br> that's like a fingerprint. That's my head.<br> There I am with Miss Judy Garland.<br> Never a dearer woman existed.<br> - Where are you?<br> - Well, I'm right outside of frame.<br> Cos if the picture went on another inch,<br> I would be... I was back behind the dais.<br> And here's Mr Myron Cohen and...<br> Jesus, where is my bottle of pills?<br> - How long have you had this joint?<br> - Joint? This is rent-controlled.<br> You oughta fix it up.<br> You're living like a loser.<br> Nobody ever comes over,<br> so what do I care?<br> Nobody comes over?<br> You ever been married?<br> No. I was engaged once<br> to a dancer, you know...<br> but she ran away with a piano<br> player and I broke off with her.<br> - You know what I'd do with this room?<br> - What?<br> Liven it up. Do it all in somethin'<br> up, you know. Pink, maybe?<br> - Pink?<br> - Yeah. You know, you gotta lighten it up.<br> Pink with maybe some gold wallpaper.<br> And you need fabric, you know.<br> Like big purple pillows or somethin'.<br> Maybe some incense.<br> What is this? A Turkish<br> whorehouse? I live here.<br> I'm serious. You gotta lighten it up.<br> Maybe some bamboo furniture. Bamboo.<br> I always wanted to do a room in<br> bamboo with, like, zebra skins.<br> - Really? Are you serious?<br> - Why not? It's exciting.<br> What you're talking about is<br> like a tropical motif, right?<br> - It's funny, cos actually I like bamboo.<br> - Really?<br> Picture, like, hanging plants maybe,<br> and a really nice tile floor.<br> Bamboo furniture. It's very<br> beautiful and very dramatic.<br> - You got an eye for drama.<br> - You really think so?<br> You sound surprised.<br> Nobody ever liked my<br> African-jungle idea before.<br> I always had this as a dream.<br> You're the first person ever liked it.<br> I'm willing to bet that you're full of<br> good ideas, but you lack confidence.<br> - You don't have any confidence.<br> - It's my big problem as a decorator.<br> Sure, it's like the acts I handle. I could<br> straighten you out in no time at all.<br> Cos I don't see you just decorating little<br> joints and little apartments in the suburbs.<br> I see you doing your gold walls<br> and your Turkish pillows...<br> and all that garbage in hotels<br> and embassies and stuff.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah, naturally.<br> - You could. I can smell it.<br> - I don't think so.<br> The boat's sailed for me. I should have<br> been more serious when I was younger.<br> Younger? You got your<br> whole life ahead of you.<br> The trouble is I look at my<br> work and I think it's ugly.<br> Well, my uncle Morris, the<br> famous diabetic from Brooklyn...<br> used to say "If you hate yourself,<br> then you hate your work."<br> I sleep at night. It's you<br> that's got the ulcer.<br> I got an ulcer, but it may be a good thing.<br> You know what my philosophy of life is?<br> That it's important to have some laughs,<br> but you gotta suffer a little too...<br> because otherwise you miss<br> the whole point to life.<br> - Know what my philosophy of life is?<br> - I can imagine.<br> It's over quick, so have a good time.<br> You see want you want, go for it.<br> Don't pay attention to anyone else. Do it to<br> the other guy first, or he'll do it to you.<br> This is a philosophy of life? It sounds like<br> the screenplay to "Murder Incorporated".<br> Hold this. That's ridiculous. No<br> wonder you don't like yourself.<br> Stop saying that.<br> I like myself fine.<br> Down deep, I sense that you don't.<br> - You're the one that's livin' like a loser.<br> - Why? Cos I haven't made it?<br> That's the beauty of this business.<br> Overnight you can go<br> from a bum to a hero.<br> - I think it's gonna happen now with Lou.<br> - We better get going.<br> Just let me say one thing. My uncle<br> Sidney... lovely uncle, dead, completely...<br> used to say three things:<br> Acceptance, forgiveness and love.<br> That is a philosophy of life: Acceptance,<br> forgiveness and love. There's where it is.<br> So tell me more about<br> the bamboo room.<br> I'm gonna stay one night. One night.<br> Cos I don't wanna incur expense.<br> I'm gonna make a phone call.<br> I got another idea.<br> - How much is a single room?<br> - Sorry. All filled up.<br> Tina?<br> Tina?<br> Tina, darling?<br> Hello, Danny.<br> Get in the car!<br> Get in the car!<br> Fellas... Fellas, can I...<br> May I just interject one thing at<br> this particular point in time?<br> - Keep goin' straight.<br> - Look, I like Johnny. I like your brother.<br> I got nothing against him. I just<br> met him today. I liked his poem.<br> What's under discussion here is the<br> girl's feelings. Where is the girl?<br> We're gonna take real<br> good care of you, pal.<br> I wanna say one thing, and I don't mean<br> to be didactic or facetious in any manner.<br> She doesn't love him. She<br> doesn't love him any more.<br> I know it's hard to take. Because we<br> all want what we can't have in life.<br> It's a natural thing, but take my<br> cousin Ceil. Not pretty like Tina at all.<br> She looks like something in<br> a reptile house in a zoo.<br> - She meets this accountant...<br> - Will you shut up?!<br> Wait, wait, wait. No.<br> You misunderstand me.<br> - Goddamn you!<br> - I'm trying to make a point.<br> Fellas, fellas, I'm a veteran.<br> I'm a veteran.<br> - Get the axe.<br> - There's an axe?<br> Fellas, I'm the beard. I'm just<br> a beard. You don't understand.<br> He's telling the truth. He<br> has nothing to do with this.<br> You don't believe me, right?<br> - We're gonna chop your legs off.<br> - Fellas, I'm only the beard.<br> Would I waste my time<br> with a guy like this?<br> Then who? You want him to walk outta<br> here, you have to give us a name.<br> - I'm not talking.<br> - No, you tell us, you punk.<br> You don't want me to rat<br> on a friend, do you?<br> Let me quote Rabbi Hirschhorn,<br> an extremely learned man...<br> - ...perhaps not of your persuasion.<br> - Who you bearding for?<br> - I'm not the guy. Isn't that enough?<br> - You two are dead men.<br> Oh, yeah? Who you bearding<br> for, you little cheese eater?<br> Cheese... I don't know exactly what<br> it means, but I know it's not good.<br> Who are you bearding for? I'll put<br> a bullet right between her eyes!<br> - Don't do that! I'll talk!<br> - Danny, don't! They'll kill him!<br> I don't wanna get my legs chopped<br> off cos I do a guy a favour.<br> - Who is it?<br> - All right, you wanna know who it is?<br> Should I tell you who it is?<br> Should I say? It's... Barney Dunn.<br> Who's Barney Dunn?<br> - Who is it?!<br> - Danny, you rat!<br> - Shut up!<br> - I don't owe you anything over this.<br> Fellas, I swear on my<br> life, it's Barney Dunn.<br> And, Barney, may God forgive me.<br> - Who?<br> - Barney Dunn. You know Barney Dunn.<br> Barney Dunn.<br> I can't hear ya.<br> Barney Dunn was the world's<br> worst ventriloquist.<br> If they couldn't get an animal<br> act, they would call Barney Dunn.<br> Barney would work children's parties.<br> Five-year-old kids would boo him.<br> Two weeks ago Danny, who<br> doesn't handle Barney...<br> that'll tell you about Barney,<br> Danny didn't wanna handle him...<br> Danny meets Barney on the street.<br> - How you doin', Barney? How's it goin'?<br> - I'm leaving on a c-cruise tomorrow.<br> - You're kidding? Where for?<br> - I'm working a s-s-ship to the B-Bahamas.<br> - Fantastic. And then back here?<br> - No. And here's the b-b-beauty part.<br> From the B-Bahamas to P-Puerto<br> Rico for th-three weeks.<br> Fantastic.<br> - So Danny names Barney Dunn.<br> - Can't they check that?<br> They do check it. They tie up Danny<br> and Tina and they go to check it.<br> What am I doing here? How did<br> I get into this? Why me?<br> What did I do to deserve<br> this that I'm here now?<br> You were really quick to come<br> up with that name so fast.<br> Great. That's wonderful. Let me tell you<br> something, darling. I was traumatised.<br> My body went into shock when<br> they stuck that gun in you.<br> I thought they're gonna kill<br> us, I'm gonna be dead...<br> and Milton is coming<br> to the Waldorf soon.<br> Listen, they're gonna be back in a<br> minute. We gotta do something.<br> I can't move a finger.<br> I'm tied up here like a pig.<br> - If we could get outta these ropes.<br> - I can't.<br> They just left one guy out there.<br> There's two of us.<br> But let me remind you, he's got<br> an axe. The man has an axe.<br> - There'll be four of us in no time.<br> - Maybe we could sneak away.<br> You know what I'm thinking,<br> though. I used to handle...<br> I used to handle an escape<br> artist named Shandar...<br> who could get outta ropes, but... the<br> problem is you gotta be standing up to...<br> And even then I'm not sure we could<br> do it. Let me ask you something.<br> Do you think it's possible we could<br> work our way off this table?<br> I can hardly move.<br> Try with me. I'm serious.<br> - Try a little bit. Come on, give it a try.<br> - You're so heavy.<br> Just try. Just do what I'm telling you.<br> Come on. It'll happen. Move. Move!<br> - OK? You all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Try and pull. That's it.<br> See? It's not so tough.<br> Very good. That's it.<br> Try and slide down. That's it.<br> That's it. Very good. Slowly.<br> That's it. Slowly.<br> That's it. Come on.<br> Now pull. Come on. Hard.<br> That's it. That's it.<br> A little more. I think<br> we got it. Attagirl.<br> That's right. OK.<br> - You got it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Very good. Now, we're...<br> Here's what... When<br> Shandar was like this...<br> what he would do is<br> he would wriggle.<br> - Wriggle?<br> - Yeah, and what happens...<br> is the ropes gradually start to get some<br> play in them, they start to get loose.<br> - Take my word for it. He would wriggle.<br> - You sure?<br> So, you ready? Ready?<br> All right, now start to wriggle.<br> That's right. Wriggle. See what<br> I mean? That's it. That's a girl.<br> Wriggle. That's it. That's it.<br> - I'm wriggling.<br> - Keep wriggling.<br> - Are you wriggling?<br> - Uh-huh. I'm wriggling.<br> - That's good wriggling.<br> - I don't wanna over-wriggle.<br> It's nice wriggling. That's it.<br> The ropes are starting to get loose.<br> Come on, it's happening.<br> My hand's getting free.<br> Keep wriggling. Don't stop now.<br> - I got it, I got it.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I got it, I got it.<br> - Yes?<br> - Great!<br> - Come on. Get this thing off.<br> Come on, keep wriggling.<br> Keep wriggling, darling. Don't...<br> I told you, that's<br> what Shandar did.<br> He would wriggle and get the whole thing<br> to happen. I saw it a million times.<br> Hey, hey! Hold it!<br> - Let's go. Jesus, where the hell are we?<br> - God.<br> What is this? This looks like<br> some kind of a factory.<br> - It looks like a warehouse.<br> - Yeah. You hear him?<br> I think he's right behind us.<br> Let's get outta here.<br> - Jeez, it's so dark.<br> - Don't panic.<br> - Looks like a lot of parade floats.<br> - Perfect.<br> There's a guy with a pistol running after<br> us, we're stuck in the Macy's Day Parade.<br> - Can you see anyone?<br> - What's going on? Where the hell are we?<br> Jesus!<br> Don't move or I'll<br> blow your brains out!<br> - Don't shoot! I'm just a beard.<br> - You're making a mistake.<br> Don't tell me you're the<br> beard, you goddamn little rat.<br> Run, Tina, run! He's outta bullets!<br> It's our chance! It's our chance!<br> All right, I'm coming!<br> You little rat! You're never gonna<br> get outta here! I'll find you.<br> I don't believe this! He's drunk! I got a<br> show in a half-hour. I got a packed house.<br> Don't panic. Don't panic.<br> I'll deal with him.<br> Relax, will ya?<br> I can talk to him. Lou...<br> - Is Milton here yet?<br> - Yes. He came with Howard Cosell.<br> Relax, everybody.<br> You're gonna be OK.<br> This is Lou's wife, Teresa.<br> That's Tina... Musante.<br> - Vitale.<br> - Danny, he's gotta go on in 20 minutes.<br> I got a full house out there.<br> Something's gotta happen.<br> Lou, say the three S's. Lou, please,<br> you gotta pull yourself together.<br> Listen to me. You're<br> gonna do a great show.<br> - He gonna be OK?<br> - Danny'll get him sober.<br> Come on, Lou. I need two aspirin, some<br> tomato juice, some Worcestershire sauce.<br> And some goat cheese<br> and some chicken fat.<br> - That'll do it?<br> - The Danny Rose formula.<br> - I still can't figure out how it works.<br> - I promise you're gonna be OK tonight.<br> One day you will hold<br> My cara mia<br> A child of your own<br> And I pray<br> Bambina, remember the stories<br> Your mama, my mama, would say<br> Keep Italian in your heart<br> Let it always be a part<br> Of you<br> Never let it fade away<br> Be a part of every day<br> Let it stay in<br> your heart for ever<br> Put Italian in your heart<br> Let it always be a part<br> Of you<br> Never let it fade away<br> Be a part of every day<br> Let it stay in<br> your heart for ever<br> My bambina<br> My cara mia<br> My bambina<br> Thank you, thank you,<br> thank you. Love you.<br> This is what you get<br> when you eat too much.<br> Uno, two!<br> Agita, my gumba, in the banzone<br> When I eat, he gets a<br> treat like a canzone<br> He enjoys every meal,<br> every bite that I steal<br> Agita, my gumba, in the banzone<br> Some people like their pizza,<br> some people like suffrite<br> And others like hot pepper<br> on everything they eat<br> You hunger with a vuole<br> to taste some bacala<br> Then all at once you think<br> "Will I answer to gumba?"<br> My lovely, lovely woman,<br> I hate to see her cry<br> But when I start to<br> mangia, I get the evil eye<br> My vuole's gettin' stronger,<br> ah, to hell with my gumba<br> Lou, you were wonderfully superb.<br> "Chicago" is my favourite.<br> - I know my fans.<br> - You were terrific.<br> - You were worried.<br> - I wasn't worried. You were fabulous.<br> - Thank you for coming.<br> - Great show.<br> George, you don't miss an act, huh?<br> How you doin', hon?<br> You holdin' up all right?<br> Bill and Diane are gonna give me a lift<br> home. I have to take care of the sitter.<br> I'd appreciate it because I gotta<br> do some serious things with Danny.<br> - I'll be home in about two, three hours.<br> - Danny, make sure he gets home early.<br> - Lou.<br> - Eddie! All right!<br> Lou, when I tell you what this woman<br> and I have been through today...<br> When you find out what you put me<br> through today... Unbelievable!<br> I gotta speak to you now<br> while I'm still high.<br> He'll fall down when I tell him.<br> Lou, I can't sleep home tonight.<br> I gotta get this off my chest. Tina's<br> here because she's part of it.<br> What?<br> Come next week, I feel some<br> changes gotta be made.<br> - Yeah? Like what?<br> - Tina and I, we're crazy about each other.<br> And I feel I gotta say<br> something to Terry about it.<br> If that's what you decide on, that's what<br> you do. If you gotta do it, you gotta do it.<br> - I just hope you know what you're doing.<br> - We're sure about a lot of things.<br> I feel for myself that I gotta<br> make a few changes.<br> - What kind of changes?<br> - Like management.<br> What do you mean, management?<br> What do you mean, management?<br> Tina's really close to Sid Bacharach.<br> You had to notice him there tonight.<br> He was there to see me.<br> I don't understand. You<br> wanna change management?<br> Don't think it's not hard for me to say,<br> but I gotta do what's right for my career.<br> What do you mean? Am I hear...?<br> I can't believe you're saying this.<br> Danny, Sid can really move me.<br> I mean, we've got this special rapport.<br> How do you know Sid? Have you been<br> pushing him to... to leave me?<br> Hey, leave me outta this. All I know is<br> he's a big talent and he's playin' joints.<br> Joints? He was lucky<br> he could get j...<br> When I met him, he was still<br> singing "Funicul Funicul".<br> - Look, Danny, facts are facts.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - This kid owes me his life.<br> - Leave her outta it. What's done is done.<br> I don't understand you, Lou.<br> We've been through so much.<br> You make everything into<br> a personal situation.<br> Of course I make it personal.<br> That's our relationship.<br> You can't put into a<br> contract what I do with you.<br> Can I give you...? My uncle<br> Meyer, the man sold apples...<br> - Say somethin'. You know I'm not verbal.<br> - This is between you.<br> You gotta do what you gotta do<br> and Danny's gotta understand it.<br> Danny, if anything comes outta this, you<br> know you're gonna be in for a taste.<br> Danny. Where you goin',<br> Danny? Danny. Danny.<br> Hey, how you doin', Danny?<br> You hear about Barney Dunn?<br> Couple of guys done a pretty good job<br> on him. They beat him up pretty badly.<br> - I thought he was on a cruise.<br> - Nah, nah, that was cancelled.<br> He's in the hospital now. It<br> was pretty rough for a while.<br> It was touch and go.<br> But it's all right now.<br> The cops got 'em. They got the<br> guys that done the job on him.<br> - Which hospital?<br> - Roosevelt.<br> How you doin', Barney?<br> Danny. Wh-wh-what<br> are you doing here?<br> Well, I heard that you<br> got beat up, so...<br> I s-s-still don't<br> know what happened.<br> I want you to know if there's<br> anything I can do, anything at all.<br> Hospital bills, anything at<br> all, I'll take care of it.<br> You wanna pay my hospital bills?<br> Danny, are you sure you're OK?<br> Really, Barney, anything at all.<br> Whatever you need.<br> I thought this was a<br> funny story. It's terrible.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> It's not my life.<br> So Lou leaves his wife and kids<br> and he moves in with Tina.<br> Sid Bacharach's handling him.<br> He's doin' all right.<br> The world and all of its gold<br> Oh, gold won't<br> bring you happiness<br> When you're growing old<br> Oh, the world,<br> it's still the same<br> You OK? You seem a little down.<br> No. I have a headache.<br> What are you giving me?<br> I ordered a Courvoisier.<br> - Didn't you order a Jack Daniels?<br> - I ordered a Courvoisier.<br> - You did say Courvoisier.<br> - Let's not make a federal case out of it.<br> - Honey, what are you doin' up?<br> - I can't sleep.<br> - It's four o'clock in the morning.<br> - Yeah, I know. I had a bad dream.<br> Is this like a thing or somethin'?<br> This is goin' on every other night.<br> - Why don't you take a pill or somethin'?<br> - I don't like pills.<br> When I can't sleep, I take one of<br> those Seconals. I go out like a baby.<br> - I'm OK. I'm fine.<br> - Listen, I got a great new idea.<br> In Atlantic City, I'll open up with<br> "You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You".<br> Then I'll go into<br> "When You're Smiling".<br> - Give me a break. It's four in the morning.<br> - You're not listening to me.<br> This is important stuff.<br> Angelina, I can't sleep.<br> I... I feel jumpy.<br> I don't know. I'm not myself.<br> I see bad dreams.<br> Deep dreams. Bad conscience.<br> Yeah. A little while<br> ago I met some man.<br> I hardly spent any time with him.<br> One day we had an adventure.<br> Yes. He makes you feel uneasy.<br> I did him some... some little wrong.<br> Just some small business matter.<br> I didn't even know him very well.<br> When I had the chance to say<br> something, I... I didn't speak up.<br> I have a vision of you...<br> standing before a large mirror.<br> I... I had that dream last week.<br> That was it, exactly my dream.<br> What is it you're seeking there?<br> I wanna rest easy again.<br> I wanna find myself.<br> I wanna wipe out my thoughts<br> and forget this guy.<br> I can't see clearly. It's unclear.<br> It's all unclear.<br> Non ci vedo bene. Non chiaro.<br> What's the matter with you lately?<br> You're so edgy.<br> I don't wanna go to California, OK?<br> It gives me the creeps out there.<br> - It's important you go to California.<br> - Well, then you go.<br> What is it with you? Lately<br> everything's goin' so nicely.<br> My comeback's in full swing now.<br> But you weren't happy in Vegas.<br> You weren't happy in Atlantic City.<br> I thought you'd be happy.<br> I'm moody. You knew I was<br> moody when you met me.<br> I had it with the moods. I gotta<br> go to California, that's it.<br> Honey, what's the matter?<br> I don't know.<br> Lou moves to LA.<br> Tina doesn't. It's all over between 'em.<br> Guess who calls her for a date.<br> - I have no idea.<br> - Remember the shaving-cream man?<br> The guy she met with<br> Danny in the reeds?<br> That's right. They start going out.<br> But she's just as moody with him.<br> They fight, they argue. Then one<br> morning... Thanksgiving morning<br> the two of them are<br> on Central Park West.<br> There's the parade.<br> - Now what's wrong?<br> - I don't know.<br> Jesus, Tina, what's wrong with you?<br> Look, maybe we should have a little<br> heart-to-heart. Everything makes you cry.<br> Maybe you should see a doctor. I don't<br> know what to do with you. Baby!<br> What are you trying to pull here?<br> - I gotta see Angelina right away.<br> - I'm sorry. Angelina's not here.<br> What time's she coming back?<br> I need her advice.<br> She's with her grandchildren.<br> She won't be here until Monday.<br> - This is important.<br> - I can't help it if it's important.<br> She won't be here until Monday.<br> Please come Monday.<br> OK, I got the frozen turkeys!<br> - Thank you, Danny.<br> - Give me a little hand. God love you.<br> - Here's your frozen turkey.<br> - Thank you.<br> B- B-Believe me, the frozen is<br> just as g-good as the r-real.<br> - Got it?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> The frozens are much cheaper<br> than the real ones.<br> - Can I help?<br> - No, sit there. You'll fall over.<br> Just dig in, dig in.<br> Don't hesitate.<br> - This is really great.<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> I'd love it.<br> There's some Tab and<br> some club soda.<br> Give her some Coke.<br> Excuse me one second.<br> Hello? Yeah, sure.<br> We're... That's right.<br> It's the twins.<br> It's the twins. They're...<br> Sure, darling. Sure.<br> And the new noses are good?<br> Yes. Sure.<br> I... I came to apologise.<br> You gonna ask me in?<br> Let me call you back. Yeah.<br> I'll get back to you. Let me<br> call you. I'll call you back.<br> Hope I'm not intruding.<br> - I realise you hate me.<br> - Bring her in. The food's gettin' cold.<br> D- D-Danny,<br> who's your fr-fr-fr... guest?<br> Oh, it's nobody. It's nothing.<br> Was it your uncle Sidney who said<br> "acceptance, forgiveness and love"?<br> Look, I've had a bad year.<br> If things don't pick up for me, I'm<br> gonna be selling storm windows soon.<br> I'd like to be friends.<br> I don't think that would<br> be such a great idea.<br> This is the best Thanksgiving<br> party we've had so far!<br> Here's your napkin, honey.<br> This is absolutely the<br> best Thanksgiving party.<br> - Danny, this is marvellous.<br> - Danny, who's your fr-fr-fr... guest?<br> - The cranberry sauce is dry.<br> - You're eating the mashed potatoes.<br> Hey, what a spread!<br> Gloria, wait a second. Hey, Danny,<br> thanks a lot for the invite.<br> Thanksgiving sure<br> rolls around fast.<br> - Well, that's my Danny Rose story.<br> - Unbelievable.<br> The man is a living legend. Do you<br> know that only six months ago...<br> they gave him the greatest honour<br> you can get in the Broadway area?<br> Look at the menu. At this delicatessen<br> they named a sandwich after him.<br> The Danny Rose Special.<br> Probably a cream cheese on a<br> bagel with marinara sauce.<br> He deserves it.<br> Did you ever go to one of<br> his Thanksgiving parties?<br> One party.<br> Where they have the frozen turkey.<br> - Economical, but a lot of laughs.<br> - Cranberry sauce made like a rocket.<br> - You had to de-thaw the corn.<br> - It was incredible.<br> Listen, excuse me. Before we go any<br> further, may I ask you a favour?<br> Can we go home now? I'm tired.<br> We're having laughs.<br> I haven't seen you in 110 years.<br> I'm going to Atlantic<br> City tomorrow.<br> - I'll get the check. I'll take care of it.<br> - Really?<br> National holiday.<br> Corbett has the check.<br> For these kind of laughs,<br> I figure it's worth it.<br> Well, we'll do it again tomorrow.<br>
