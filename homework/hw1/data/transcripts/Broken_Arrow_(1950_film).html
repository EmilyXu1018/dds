                        bBroken Arrow/b<br> This is the story of a land...<br> ...and its people in<br> the year 1870...<br> ...and of a man...<br> ...whose name was Cochise.<br> He was an Indian...<br> ...leader of the Chiricahua<br> Apache tribe.<br> I was involved in the story...<br> ...and what I am telling happened<br> exactly as you'll see it.<br> The only change will be that<br> when the Apaches speak...<br> ...they will speak in our language.<br> What took place is part of<br> the history of Arizona...<br> ...and it began for me here,<br> where you see me riding.<br> Since leaving the Army I had been<br> prospecting for gold off and...<br> ...one day I heard the colonel<br> at Tucson wanted to see me.<br> The story started when I saw<br> buzzards circling in the sky.<br> The buzzard's a smart bird.<br> Something...<br> ...or somebody,<br> was getting ready to die.<br> I figured it was a hurt deer<br> or a rabbit or a snake.<br> Not a rabbit...<br> ...not a deer.<br> His kind was more dangerous<br> than a snake.<br> He was an Apache.<br> For ten years we'd been on a<br> savage war with his people...<br> ...a bloody, no-give, no-take war.<br> Drink.<br> Better slow.<br> I could have killed you before.<br> A fire was dangerous<br> in Apache country.<br> But his wounds were bad and<br> he was running a high fever.<br> He had eight pieces of buckshot<br> in his back and I dug them out.<br> He was in pain but he never<br> let out a sound.<br> For the next few days I panned<br> the stream for gold...<br> ...and watched the boy.<br> I wanted to be on the move, and<br> I was glad he was recovering.<br> Do your legs feel stronger today?<br> Little bit.<br> You've still got a limp.<br> Today I must leave.<br> No, I must go. Too soon for you.<br> For my legs, yes,<br> but for my family, no.<br> This is my novice time.<br> I am 14. So I learn to be a man.<br> I go on trips alone.<br> But I have been away too long.<br> In the wickiup my mother is crying.<br> My father looks for me, I think.<br> I am their only one now.<br> My brother and my sister were<br> killed at Big Creek.<br> "My mother is crying", he said.<br> It never struck me that an Apache<br> woman would cry over her son...<br> ...like any other woman.<br> "Apaches are wild animals",<br> we all said.<br> Do you pray to Killer of Enemies?<br> Not even to Life Giver?<br> The ones up there.<br> We have another name.<br> Apaches pray for all<br> white men to die.<br> But now I pray to keep you safe.<br> At sunset last night, I threw pollen<br> to the four winds for you.<br> Thanks, boy.<br> This is very big...<br> ...against headache and sickness.<br> Now it is yours.<br> They could have killed.<br> Put away your gun.<br> My people are watching us.<br> They see I am unharmed.<br> This is clear talk.<br> It says they can still kill.<br> This white man is my friend.<br> This white man is my friend.<br> He must not be hurt.<br> When did my son become a tame Apache?<br> Father look! He gave me life again<br> when the soldiers wounded me.<br> Where did you meet soldiers?<br> It will shame us to say.<br> An Apache should not do what<br> others cannot know.<br> This one...<br> - ...he was with them?<br> - No.<br> He found me later. He healed me.<br> It will be wrong to harm him.<br> You do no give orders.<br> You speak our tongue?<br> A little.<br> White men pay many dollars<br> for the scalp of an Apache.<br> I know.<br> Then why did you not take his scalp?<br> If I kill an Apache it'll not<br> be for scalp or money.<br> Why not? My people and your<br> people are at war.<br> It is not my way to fight.<br> - It is the way of all whites.<br> - It is not my way.<br> You are a woman maybe.<br> Apaches do not take scalps either.<br> And they are not women.<br> He hides something.<br> Why are you here in our mountains?<br> I look for gold and silver.<br> For what?<br> For yellow iron.<br> You did not kill.<br> We will not kill this time.<br> But not again.<br> Give him his gun.<br> They wanted to kill me, all right,<br> but they let me go.<br> I learned things that day.<br> Apache mothers cried<br> about their sons.<br> Apache men had a sense<br> of fair play.<br> Ambush! Run!<br> Two men were killed, and for<br> the three wounded it was worse.<br> But this was war, and it was<br> cruelty in both sides.<br> On one of the men<br> they found a pouch...<br> ...which held three Apache scalps.<br> So they dug a pit and they rubbed<br> his face with sweet juice...<br> ...and made me watch the ants come.<br> Learn it...<br> ...learn it well, this is Apache land.<br> You have no right here.<br> Where Cochise lives,<br> no white man can live.<br> Take your weapons. Go!<br> Let your face not be seen again!<br> Howdy, gents.<br> Hi, Tom.<br> - Find yourself a gold mine?<br> - No.<br> Howdy, Terry.<br> Just coffee for me.<br> - We have smoked turkey today.<br> - No, just coffee, thanks.<br> Wipe them all out...<br> ...but cheer them.<br> - Jeffords?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm Colonel Bernall.<br> You received my message?<br> That's why I came.<br> What's on you mind?<br> I'm the new chief at Fort Grand.<br> Congratulations.<br> My orders are to clean out<br> Cochise and his Apaches.<br> A big order, sir.<br> Wipe them all out.<br> Butcher them like hogs, I say...<br> ...like hogs.<br> This man was in a party of miners...<br> ...ambushed yesterday by Apaches.<br> Where was the ambush?<br> Just south of here.<br> They wounded Cochise<br> and killed 12 Apaches out of 50.<br> There weren't 50 only 5,<br> and not a one scratched.<br> How do you know, Jeffords?<br> I watched it.<br> Watched it? Seems to me most<br> men would have lent a hand.<br> I was tied.<br> The Apaches got me earlier.<br> You fought your way out?<br> They let me go.<br> I never heard of a thing like that<br> happening to a white man.<br> - Did you, John?<br> - No.<br> - Did you, Milt?<br> - No.<br> I ran across a<br> wounded Chiricahua boy.<br> I healed him up. They thought<br> they owed me something.<br> - Apaches playing fair?<br> - Yes.<br> I don't understand.<br> You mean you found a wounded<br> Apache and didn't kill him?<br> That's right.<br> I'd like to ask you why?<br> What do you want from me, Colonel?<br> Jeffords...<br> ...I think I know how<br> we can stop Cochise.<br> I have 250 men from Pennsylvania<br> and New Jersey.<br> They're disciplined troopers.<br> - Yes, I've seen them around.<br> - I have a good plan.<br> I want information from you and<br> I want you to do reconnoitering.<br> In six months the war will be over<br> and we'll have Cochise hanging.<br> No, you won't, Colonel.<br> Jeffords, I'm an expert<br> on open warfare.<br> - I have thirty...<br> - Cochise can't read a map...<br> ...but he knows every gulley,<br> every mountain in Arizona.<br> His men and horses can go<br> twice as far as yours.<br> He can't write his name...<br> ...but his intelligence<br> service knows when...<br> ...you got to Fort Grant and<br> how many men you've got.<br> He's stopped the<br> Butterfield stage from running...<br> ...he's stopped the U.S. mails<br> from going through.<br> For the first time he has all<br> the Apaches under one command.<br> You're not going to string<br> him up in six months.<br> Not in six years.<br> Good day, gents.<br> - Terry.<br> - Jeffords!<br> Will you scout for me?<br> - You can find somebody else.<br> - Maybe...<br> ...Captain Jeffords became too<br> friendly with the Apaches.<br> Maybe he doesn't know<br> what side he's on.<br> Easy, gents.<br> I'm not looking for trouble but<br> if you don't fight them...<br> ...you're with them.<br> I've got to say that.<br> Who says so? What's your name?<br> Ben Slade. I own a ranch only<br> a mile out from Fort Grant.<br> The Apaches burned my<br> house last month.<br> My wife was inside.<br> They almost got my boy too.<br> A white man should hate that.<br> Right. Anybody would.<br> Why don't you join<br> the Colonel's staff?<br> - That's private business, Slade.<br> - War ain't private business...<br> ...when they kill women and kids.<br> At Big Creek we killed<br> Indian women and kids.<br> Cochise started this and any...<br> Hold on! Let's just get<br> the facts straight here.<br> Cochise didn't start this war.<br> A snooty little lieutenant<br> fresh out of the east started it.<br> He flew a flag of truce which<br> Cochise honored...<br> ...then he hanged his brother and...<br> ...others under the flag.<br> You hear all sorts of stories.<br> You want to know why I didn't<br> kill that Apache boy?<br> For the same reason I wouldn't kill<br> your boy or scout for the army.<br> I'm sick and tired of<br> all this killing.<br> And, who asked us<br> out here in first place?<br> I don't know, Tom.<br> I don't say we do right.<br> But we're bringing civilization here.<br> Clothes, carpets, hats,<br> boots, medicine.<br> Why I got a wagonload of whiskey...<br> ...waiting in the east?<br> I could sell that<br> if it wasn't for Cochise.<br> It's an ambush!<br> Run!<br> Juan, come on in.<br> - Hi, Tom.<br> - Hi, Milt.<br> After all this time,<br> one single freight wagon...<br> ...squeezed through.<br> Cochise didn't show his ugly face.<br> Are you sending your mail riders<br> with the military?<br> It'd take the Army and Navy.<br> No eastern mail has gone out<br> or come in for seven weeks.<br> The Apaches are shooting<br> my job right from under me.<br> Maybe there's a way to<br> get your mail through.<br> A new route?<br> Could I use this office<br> every afternoon for a while?<br> - What for?<br> - Juan.<br> Juan, I've got work for you.<br> I want to hire you for<br> maybe almost a moon.<br> I want you to teach me<br> to speak Apache good.<br> I want to learn about Apache spirits.<br> I want to learn about the Apache ways.<br> Apache in here.<br> No white man asks to learn<br> these things. Why do you?<br> I want to speak to Cochise.<br> Are you crazy, Tom?<br> Milt, I'm sick and tired<br> of being in the middle.<br> I'm tired of people like Lowrie,<br> Terry, and you...<br> ...asking my position.<br> I've been willing to go<br> into Cochise's territory...<br> ...to look for gold.<br> I've risked before.<br> Cochise will not speak<br> with white men.<br> We'll send up smoke signals.<br> He will not come to see you.<br> No, I want to go and see him.<br> - To his stronghold?<br> - That's right.<br> No white man's seen<br> Cochise in ten years...<br> - ...and lived to tell it.<br> - Once you could talk to him.<br> Don't try it, Tom.<br> The ants will eat your eyes.<br> That could happen any time.<br> Like the other day.<br> Juan, will you teach me?<br> I want to tell Cochise to<br> let the mail go through.<br> Maybe even about peace.<br> Yes...<br> ...I will teach you, and for this<br> I will not take any dollars.<br> But I think it will end bad.<br> I think Cochise will kill you.<br> Milt, can we use the office?<br> It's your eyes.<br> Good enough. Apache eyes quick.<br> This says you come in peace.<br> They will doubt it but it'll<br> make them want to find out.<br> You've speak our language well.<br> You do not yet think<br> like an Apache...<br> ...but you are close to.<br> Juan, you've been a good guide.<br> If I see Cochise...<br> ...what grows from our talks<br> will be from you too.<br> Last night I heard an owl...<br> ...the worst of all signs.<br> It is not yet too late.<br> Come back with me.<br> They will kill you.<br> I didn't hear the owl, Juan,<br> but thank you anyway.<br> Remember then:<br> ...If you see him...<br> ...do not lie to him.<br> Not in the smallest thing.<br> His eyes will see into your heart.<br> He is greater than other men.<br> I started into the canyons that<br> led into Cochise's country.<br> I never felt so lonely and<br> frightened in my life.<br> For three days I climbed<br> higher towards...<br> ...the Apache stronghold.<br> On the third day...<br> ...I was nearing the entrance<br> to the stronghold.<br> Juan had told me what to look for.<br> Cochise had given me<br> permission to enter.<br> I kept my hands visible...<br> ...away from my weapons...<br> ...and I tried to look at ease.<br> It is known that the chief<br> of Chiricahua Apaches...<br> ...is the greatest Indian leader.<br> I have come to speak to him about<br> the welfare of his people.<br> It is known he respects truth...<br> ...as he respects bravery.<br> You will hold these for me?<br> I will want them when I leave.<br> How do you know you will<br> leave here alive?<br> I am Cochise.<br> Speak.<br> When the Indian wishes to<br> signal his brother...<br> ...he does so by smoke signs.<br> This is the white man's signal.<br> My brothers far away can look at<br> this and understand my meaning.<br> We call this mail.<br> The men who carry the<br> mail are like the air...<br> ...that carries the<br> Apache smoke signals.<br> They seek no trouble.<br> Yet your warriors kill them.<br> I've come here ask you to let<br> these men travel in safety.<br> This mail carries war<br> signals against us.<br> No, this is used for other talk.<br> War signals are sent<br> by the military...<br> ...by special ways.<br> How?<br> Sometimes by a thing<br> we call the telegraph.<br> Other times by men like me.<br> You have carried messages against us?<br> When I was a scout for<br> the military, yes.<br> You have fought us?<br> Yes.<br> In the battle of Apache Pass.<br> Come with me.<br> You are a brave man.<br> Now hear me.<br> I am the leader of my people.<br> They do not betray me and<br> I do not betray them.<br> We fight for out land against<br> Americans who try to take it.<br> You give me no reason why I should<br> not kill American mail riders...<br> ...and kill you too.<br> You were not asked to come here.<br> Mail riders do you no harm.<br> Apaches who did your people<br> no harm were hanged.<br> One was my brother.<br> My people have done<br> yours great wrong.<br> I have always said this.<br> Do you think because I am<br> an Indian I am a fool?<br> You can trick me?<br> I would not have come here<br> if I thought that.<br> A fool sees only today.<br> Because I respect you and<br> your people, I think of tomorrow.<br> What about tomorrow?<br> The Apaches are warriors<br> without equal.<br> But they are small in number...<br> ...and tomorrow they'll be smaller.<br> I will not talk of that with you.<br> Is it not possible that your<br> people and mine...<br> ...can some day live together<br> like brothers?<br> That is strange talk<br> from a white man.<br> Your people do not want peace.<br> They have taught me that.<br> This mail can be the first step.<br> I ask you to think on it.<br> Why should not the<br> white man act first?<br> Am I better than the white man?<br> A white man has come here.<br> I ask you to think of your people...<br> ...and look at tomorrow.<br> My mind must work on it.<br> You will rest here tonight.<br> It is my strong wish.<br> Walk with me so they will<br> see us together...<br> ...so you will be safe here.<br> What is the meaning of the dance?<br> The Spirits of Good and<br> Evil are dancing.<br> Not everyone can do it.<br> If it's done wrong they<br> will be angry up there.<br> This must be the dance preceding<br> the sunrise ceremony for a girl.<br> You know about it?<br> A little bit.<br> Without words it tells me things.<br> You are very different from<br> other whites, Tall One.<br> You learn to speak our tongue...<br> ...try to understand our ways.<br> It is good to understand<br> the ways of others.<br> I respect your people, Cochise.<br> You know what I am thinking?<br> Maybe some day you will<br> kill me or I will kill you...<br> ...but we will not spit<br> on each other.<br> That is how I feel.<br> The girl inside the wickiup is in<br> the holiest time of her live.<br> These four days she becomes<br> White Painted Lady, Mother of Life.<br> It is good luck to visit her now.<br> - Would you like to visit her?<br> - Yes.<br> Were you ever wounded?<br> In my arm.<br> We will tell her.<br> For this night only this girl is<br> more holy than most, maybe...<br> ...because she has been away<br> from us for a long time.<br> She is very old for this ceremony.<br> It's very special.<br> White Painted Lady...<br> ...I have old wounds.<br> Yes...<br> ...but each scar is a mark<br> of love for your people.<br> The path of you people is<br> stretched long behind you...<br> ...and you are the head...<br> ...and you are the heart...<br> ...and you are the blood.<br> Killer of Enemies is your<br> father and you are his son.<br> You will be well.<br> I have brought someone with me.<br> Then he is welcome.<br> He has an old arm wound.<br> Give me your arm.<br> Does it hurt you?<br> Sometimes.<br> It will never hurt again.<br> Your life will be long.<br> The good things will be yours.<br> The sun will shine for you.<br> What's her name?<br> Sonseeahray.<br> It means Morning Star.<br> Morning Star.<br> This is called shaving.<br> You...<br> ...see white men have more hair on<br> their faces than Indians, so...<br> ...they cut it of instead<br> of pulling the hairs out.<br> Maybe you'd like to come closer.<br> Don't be afraid, Sonseeahray.<br> See?<br> I'm not afraid.<br> I thought you were skinning yourself.<br> No.<br> - Does it hurt?<br> - No.<br> How did you know I was there?<br> I saw you through this.<br> This is much better than looking<br> in a pool of water.<br> And now I see you.<br> What a thing it is.<br> It's yours to keep.<br> Well...<br> ...if you had it you could<br> see how beautiful you are.<br> Why do you leave? Stay, please.<br> It is not fitting. I...<br> ...I should have run<br> away quick before.<br> Why?<br> I am not married.<br> Are you not allowed to<br> talk to Apache men?<br> Old men.<br> Never young men?<br> Only at ceremonies or in the dancing.<br> I thought that Apache boys and girls<br> pick those they wanted.<br> Well, how can they do that<br> if they do not meet?<br> They meet.<br> - There are ways.<br> - What ways?<br> They meet by accident<br> where no one sees them.<br> Like my mother could<br> see me here with you.<br> I understand.<br> Now I must go. I have work<br> to pick juniper berries.<br> Where?<br> There.<br> I was going to walk up<br> that way myself...<br> ...by accident.<br> Sonseeahray.<br> I walk this way because I don't<br> know when I may see you again.<br> When do you go?<br> I don't know. Cochise said<br> he would talk to me soon.<br> - Will you come back?<br> - I hope so.<br> I want to. It's important to me.<br> Why?<br> May I speak truly...<br> ...from my heart?<br> It will be all right.<br> All my life I've been mostly alone.<br> I wanted it that way...<br> ...but when I saw you in the wickiup<br> and you touched me...<br> ...and you prayed for me...<br> ...I felt bad being alone...<br> ...and I knew that I needed to<br> see you again before I left...<br> ...so that I could find out if<br> it was the same as last night.<br> Is it the same?<br> Yes.<br> So now when I go away...<br> ...I'll be lonely for someone for<br> the first time in my life.<br> I have decided about the mail.<br> If I let the riders go in safety,<br> but no one else...<br> ...there will be no loss.<br> It will show the whites<br> what power the Apache has.<br> It makes me laugh.<br> A good step. The seed is small...<br> ...maybe the tree will grow big.<br> I'll be happy to tell my people.<br> Is it straight, Captain?<br> You saw Cochise himself?<br> That's right.<br> Any lad who would go into<br> Cochise's camp alone...<br> ...is some punkin of a man.<br> Or a blasted liar!<br> I believe Captain Jefford's word...<br> ...but not the word of<br> and Apache murderer.<br> Cochise said the mail<br> would ride safe. I believe him.<br> While you were up there with him...<br> ...his men attacked a wagon train<br> near here and killed every one.<br> Another band attacked Kliner's ranch<br> and killed three men and a boy.<br> Cochise never said anything<br> about calling off the war.<br> He said the mail was safe.<br> Are you willing to bet on<br> the word of an Indian?<br> You name it.<br> Will you lay three hundred dollars...<br> ...that five riders in succession<br> leave here and five come back.<br> You've got a bet.<br> The mail's piled up...<br> ...and the route's guaranteed safe<br> by Tom Jeffords and Cochise.<br> Three days of riding in<br> the sunshine at high pay.<br> Who's first?<br> Looks like you'll have to<br> go yourself, Jeffords.<br> Only that won't prove a thing.<br> I'll go.<br> That'll prove something.<br> Duffield's back!<br> It's Duffield.<br> He's back.<br> Good boy!<br> See any Apaches?<br> Saw a few some signals but<br> not one live Indian.<br> Hi, Milt.<br> - It's all right, Tom.<br> - Why'd you take so long?<br> When I got there safe I got drunk.<br> Took time to sober up.<br> One made it but there's<br> still four more.<br> My bet's safe.<br> You want to double it?<br> After Duffield returned,<br> we sent out a second rider.<br> He saw some Apaches but<br> nothing happened.<br> The third rider, too, said it<br> was peaceful on the trail.<br> When the fourth rider went out<br> I was really proud of Cochise.<br> The days passed quietly and<br> on one of those quiet days...<br> ...a wagon train left<br> Messilla Park for Tucson.<br> Colonel Bernall was in charge.<br> Spectacular country, isn't, General?<br> I wouldn't presume to tell and<br> Indian fighter his business...<br> ...but we're inviting an ambush.<br> Apaches could be hiding over there.<br> I'm not only inviting ambush,<br> I'm praying for it.<br> Why?<br> You've only got 75 men.<br> My mule drivers are armed...<br> ...and I've got 50 riflemen hiding<br> under blankets in the wagons.<br> My eyes are getting old.<br> Nahilzay!<br> Halt!<br> Pistol attack!<br> No mister, no!<br> Goklia! Cut them off!<br> They're cutting off the cavalry!<br> Halt!<br> Nahilzay! Pionsenay!<br> The foot soldiers!<br> Seize the wagons!<br> Cut to pieces...<br> ...fifty dead and a hundred wounded.<br> Colonel Bernall killed...<br> ...five thousand pounds of grain,<br> every wagon, gun, and mule.<br> How did Cochise know we had<br> men hidden in the wagons?<br> He knows what goes on everywhere.<br> Who's the spy? I say, hang him.<br> I can tell you.<br> We all can.<br> Who?<br> Duffield in here?<br> Yeah.<br> What do you want?<br> Your last mail rider's just<br> come in, safe and sound.<br> Thanks.<br> Yeah...<br> ...where's Lowrie?<br> You lost your bet, Lowrie.<br> It don't pay to bet<br> with Tom Jeffords.<br> He's a personal friend of<br> that murderer, Cochise.<br> It was all a plot.<br> How was it fixed?<br> - I got both hands on the bar.<br> - How was it fixed?<br> I'm a rancher, not a gunner.<br> Slade. You got friends here.<br> You want to plug me.<br> Cochise don't do favors for nothing.<br> - He got something.<br> - What? What'd he get?<br> You tell us. Was it guns,<br> or was it whiskey?<br> Anybody else want to<br> call me a renegade?<br> You are not a renegade, Jeffords.<br> A man's a liar who says you are...<br> ...but why is Cochise<br> so partial to you?<br> How does he let the<br> mail rider through...<br> ...on the same day he wipes<br> out a wagon train?<br> Because he's a man of honor.<br> A man of honor?<br> No Indian's a man of honor.<br> The first peace move in ten years<br> and you're blind, all of you.<br> We'll have peace when every<br> Apache is hung from a tree!<br> Here's your 300 dollars, Jeffords.<br> The drinks are on me.<br> I don't drink on any Indian lover.<br> He's a copperhead. He sold us out.<br> String him up!<br> What are we waiting for?<br> Release that man.<br> Release that man.<br> - I'm grateful to you, General.<br> - I don't want your gratitude.<br> I won't scout Indians for<br> you or anybody else.<br> - I don't want you to.<br> - What then?<br> I want you to take me to see Cochise.<br> If anybody can do it, you can.<br> I know you have reason to be angry.<br> But please hear me out.<br> You don't like<br> Army officers apparently.<br> Does this also prejudice<br> you against me?<br> That depends on how you read it.<br> The Bible I read preaches brotherhood.<br> Suppose their skins aren't white.<br> Are they still God's children?<br> My Bible says nothing about<br> the pigmentation of the skin.<br> There was a General<br> served under Grant...<br> ...the Christian General.<br> Yes, also Bible-Reading-Howard.<br> Why do you want to see Cochise?<br> To make a peace treaty with him.<br> Who sent you here?<br> The President of the U.S.<br> - With what power?<br> - Full power to make a fair treaty.<br> To be changed later.<br> My treaty will stand.<br> I have the President's word.<br> I'll do nothing, General,<br> to betray Cochise.<br> Why all this change of<br> heart in Washington?<br> President Grant is eager for a<br> fair peace with the Apaches.<br> - What is a fair peace?<br> - Suppose you tell me.<br> Equality.<br> The Apaches are a free people.<br> They have a right to stay free...<br> - ...on their own land.<br> - The whole southwest?<br> No.<br> No, even Cochise wouldn't ask<br> for that now. He's a realist.<br> But a clear territory<br> that's Apache...<br> ...ruled by Apaches<br> that's what I mean.<br> No soldiers on it.<br> Yes, I'll agree to that. What else?<br> You can talk the rest<br> over the Cochise.<br> - You'll take me to him alone?<br> - Without soldiers?<br> - Is that the best way?<br> - That's the only way.<br> I'll go alone.<br> I'll see Cochise.<br> I'll get in touch with you.<br> Read your Bible for me too.<br> I like the way you read it.<br> Welcome.<br> Your signals were seen and they<br> have been told to Cochise.<br> He is in the other stronghold.<br> He asks you to wait<br> and be comfortable.<br> He will return.<br> I will wait.<br> My feet are tired from trying<br> to find you by accident.<br> Waiting for you, I...<br> ...I have washed my hair twice<br> and my clothes three times.<br> How is this soap made?<br> It comes from yucca root.<br> We grind it up.<br> Sonseeahray...<br> ...there's something I need to know.<br> I've been away almost a moon.<br> Has anything changed with you?<br> No.<br> When you went away I...<br> ...I became frightened.<br> I thought...<br> ...he won't come back...<br> ...and if he does, when he returns<br> from his own people...<br> ...he will look at me with cool eyes.<br> But then I...<br> ...I stopped being afraid...<br> ...in here.<br> You're trembling.<br> You're not frightened of me?<br> No.<br> Only you put such new<br> feelings in my heart.<br> I am trembling inside too.<br> Should I hide it?<br> No.<br> Tom!<br> Here they come and<br> he rides before them.<br> It will be told at our campfires...<br> ...how the Chiracahuas fought.<br> How the great Cochise led us.<br> A great wagon train destroyed.<br> Their wagons and horses taken.<br> Corn for the whole winter...<br> ...blankets, guns!<br> In a battle there are losses.<br> Some of our men have gone to<br> live with their fathers.<br> They were brave.<br> They died honorably.<br> Now for the last time,<br> listen to their names.<br> They will be angry if their names<br> are ever mentioned again.<br> Ponce.<br> Victorio.<br> Pionsenay and his son Machogee.<br> Naratena.<br> Big Chee.<br> No, thank you.<br> If I make a peace with<br> this General...<br> ...can other bigger break it?<br> No, he speaks for the Chief.<br> There's no one bigger.<br> - Can I trust them?<br> - Will they trust you?<br> My word is my life.<br> I do not break it.<br> I know that. They do not.<br> There can be no peace<br> without good will.<br> Try it.<br> All Americans are not<br> like that lieutenant.<br> You trust me, Cochise.<br> There are Americans that I trust.<br> There are Indians that<br> I would not trust.<br> Me too.<br> After eating, wipe the<br> hands on the arms.<br> The grease is good for them.<br> Among white men we wash it off.<br> What a waste.<br> My friend, all evening your eyes<br> have gone to that same maiden.<br> You must understand...<br> ...any man may be friendly with a<br> woman whose husband is dead...<br> ...but not with a maiden<br> like Sonseeahray.<br> Cochise, I...<br> This girl has been asked for already.<br> I think she will be married soon.<br> You have been chosen.<br> It will be an insult not to go.<br> We should not be seen together, Tom.<br> If that is true, why did you<br> choose me to dance with?<br> I could not help it.<br> With me it's the same.<br> I'll speak to your parents tonight.<br> No, Tom. It will cause deep trouble.<br> - You must not.<br> - It causes trouble already.<br> You have not acted like my brother.<br> I told you that she is a maiden,<br> and yet you came here.<br> I want her for my wife.<br> I will do all the things expected<br> of a husband here.<br> I refused Nahilzay once.<br> I will again.<br> I am glad it is the right way...<br> ...but it will not be easy for you.<br> You are an American.<br> Where will you live? Here?<br> Apaches who have suffered from<br> white men will hate you.<br> Tucson, maybe?<br> Won't the whites hate your wife for<br> of the color of her skin?<br> You will go far away maybe...<br> ...in new places...<br> ...but your eyes will see nothing.<br> Always they will be<br> turned backwards...<br> ...toward home.<br> And you, Sonseeahray...<br> ...they will look at you as<br> at a strange animal...<br> ...and make jokes.<br> Hear me, Tall One...<br> ...I ask you to think on it.<br> Your way will be filled<br> with bitterness.<br> Think...<br> ...is it not better to<br> live with your own?<br> Though you are my friend, Cochise,<br> nothing can change it.<br> I will marry Sonseeahray.<br> What he says does not have to be.<br> You are young. You do not know.<br> With him I do not tremble...<br> ...even before you.<br> I cannot say more against it.<br> But it won't be easy.<br> Her parents. You will need<br> a strong go-between.<br> Will you be my go-between?<br> No other can do it.<br> I will speak for you tonight,<br> otherwise it will be worse.<br> Already everyone knows of this.<br> Your secret was as quiet<br> as the thunder.<br> Also I will speak to Nahilzay.<br> He has bad luck. It has happened<br> before to other men.<br> You wait in your wickiup maybe.<br> Walk up and down.<br> It is good for people in love.<br> Well?<br> You have no luck with women.<br> They refused.<br> I'll take her away from here!<br> She'll go with me too.<br> They did not refuse.<br> I make a joke.<br> It is always a good joke.<br> It is all arranged. Three horses<br> and saddles to the parents.<br> I'll get them in Tucson.<br> No. You will let me<br> give them for you.<br> - No.<br> - No, I want to.<br> They're almost yours anyway.<br> They come from your people.<br> I want to do this for you.<br> You marry next full moon.<br> Why the delay?<br> Her mother decided. It is her right.<br> Listen now.<br> Go to Tucson.<br> Look into the heart of this general.<br> Bring him back if you believe him.<br> I will send out runners, Apaches<br> from all tribes will come here.<br> To talk of peace is a big thing.<br> I cannot decide it alone.<br> My people may not want it.<br> I make no promises.<br> That is not expected.<br> Good sleep, my brother.<br> Remember, no promises.<br> I heard noise.<br> It is not your knife.<br> It is an Apache knife.<br> To attack someone who has been<br> given safety here is forbidden.<br> It is a terrible wrong.<br> It cannot be allowed.<br> Nothing's changed.<br> Go to Tucson.<br> Return in ten days.<br> I ask you to forgive me that one<br> of my people broke my word.<br> Nahilzay.<br> In battle I have had no one like you.<br> Our lives were often mixed.<br> It is ended. You have<br> betrayed our people.<br> I went back to Tucson and<br> studied General Howard.<br> Before our return I learned to<br> respect the Christian General.<br> I prayed that a decent peace<br> would come from this.<br> I wanted it for my country...<br> ...for Cochise and his people...<br> ...and I wanted it because<br> I loved a girl.<br> I am told it is permitted to visit.<br> For a short time only.<br> My mother is inside the wickiup.<br> You will sit there...<br> ...and I will keep sitting here...<br> ...for we must not even<br> touch our hands.<br> During the days I...<br> ...I am very busy now. I prepare<br> my clothes for the wedding.<br> I must build a special wickiup<br> for our honeymoon...<br> ...away from everybody.<br> Our honeymoon, Tom!<br> I must also build the wickiup<br> we will live in.<br> In all this my mother<br> helps me and teaches me...<br> ...and I try to do as I...<br> ...I think she did when<br> she was a girl.<br> And she couldn't have done it neater.<br> What is that? What does it mean?<br> That's something Americans say.<br> It means that I love you and<br> I'll honor your parents.<br> You understand, Cochise,<br> about the signing of this map.<br> I will place my name upon yours...<br> ...you will place<br> your mark upon mine.<br> What is this signing?<br> This is proof for all people of<br> any agreement that is made.<br> It is as we agreed yesterday.<br> You will explain it to the others.<br> The peace conference had been<br> going on for four days...<br> ...and we were asked to approach<br> the meeting place.<br> We finally met the most important<br> men of the Apache tribes.<br> They had come from Arizona<br> and New Mexico...<br> ...they would decide with Cochise<br> whether there would be peace.<br> My white brother<br> will tell you something.<br> I have in my hand here a map.<br> This is a sort of picture writing.<br> It shows the Apache territory,<br> fifty thousand square miles...<br> ...that you have agreed upon.<br> This map will go back<br> to Washington...<br> ...were the Chief of all<br> the white men lives.<br> If you make a treaty of peace...<br> ...this will be part of that treaty.<br> If we make peace with<br> the Americans...<br> ...can we still raid the Mexicans?<br> There cannot be war against<br> the Mexicans either.<br> Let the white eyes...<br> Wait. We will talk of<br> this by ourselves.<br> Now is the time only for questions.<br> If the chief of the white men<br> dies, what will follow?<br> His word is a bond on<br> the chief who follows him.<br> Do others wish to speak?<br> I have a question.<br> Suppose some white man wants<br> yellow iron and he comes into our land.<br> Can we kill him?<br> He should be captured and<br> given to our military.<br> Then he will be judged and punished.<br> What if he resists capture until<br> he has killed one of my men?<br> If a white man kills an Indian on<br> your territory we will hung him.<br> That will be something<br> for Cochise to see.<br> Who else?<br> You will go now.<br> I will bring you our decision.<br> I trust none of it.<br> Four days ago we were given<br> our territory on a piece of paper.<br> Today we cannot go into Mexico.<br> The American General says no.<br> Already our territory is smaller.<br> Where will we get horses if not by<br> taking them from the Mexican?<br> The government will give us cattle.<br> We will raise and trade them.<br> The answer of a woman.<br> I am not afraid.<br> I speak from my heart.<br> You speak well.<br> Speak more.<br> Apaches are not<br> grandmothers to cattle.<br> Cochise now fears battle and<br> is ready to surrender.<br> It is not this false peace<br> we need but a new chief.<br> Now I say this.<br> The American keep cattle but<br> they are not soft or weak.<br> Why should not the Apache<br> be able to learn new ways?<br> It is not easy to change but<br> sometimes it is required.<br> The Americans are growing stronger...<br> ...while we are growing weaker.<br> If a big wind comes,<br> a tree must bend...<br> ...or be lifted out by its roots.<br> I will make a test of<br> it for three moons.<br> I break the arrow.<br> I will try the way of peace.<br> I will give my word to the<br> American General tonight.<br> Those who stay with me<br> must keep my word.<br> Let all others walk away.<br> They are no longer my brothers.<br> If more walk away than stay...<br> ...then I will no longer<br> be your chief.<br> I walk away.<br> I walk away.<br> I walk away.<br> I walk away.<br> I walk away.<br> I walk away.<br> Who else comes?<br> Who else comes?<br> Who else?<br> Take your women, your children...<br> ...your horses, your weapons.<br> Leave our territory.<br> I leave you my name also.<br> Now I am ashamed to be a Chiricahua.<br> I will take the name Mexican<br> enemies have given me.<br> The Whites will learn it...<br> ...and you will learn it.<br> From now on...<br> ...I am Geronimo!<br> If Geronimo or his followers come<br> to this territory again...<br> ...let them come with weapons.<br> I am worried.<br> They're taking a long time...<br> ...too long.<br> I am worried too.<br> This is delicious. What is it?<br> Pony. In you honor, General.<br> Pony? What kind of meat's that?<br> A pony is a small horse, General.<br> We will try this peace.<br> But there must be a waiting time...<br> ...a time for testing. Three moons.<br> Why is it needed?<br> The white man has not kept<br> a peace in the past.<br> - Three month armistice.<br> - It's a good idea.<br> The first stone.<br> For every day without war<br> there will be another.<br> When 3 moons have passed,<br> the pile will be high.<br> Then we will place a white flag<br> on it and there will be peace.<br> My heart is glad, Cochise.<br> I am not yet glad.<br> To talk a peace is not hard.<br> To live it is very hard.<br> I will wait three moons to be glad.<br> Not everyone was happy<br> about the treaty.<br> Some still thought Cochise<br> was a liar and a murderer...<br> ...and peace impossible<br> until he was dead.<br> But the 90 days of<br> the armistice began.<br> I saw things that never<br> happened before.<br> Near Fort Grant...<br> ...a cavalry patrol passed<br> some Apaches.<br> They didn't talk...<br> ...they didn't pretend<br> they'd become friends.<br> But they didn't shoot.<br> Two days later the first coach<br> in five years left Tucson.<br> I rode with it on my way<br> back to the Stronghold.<br> Where's that water<br> you said we came to?<br> Right down below.<br> That's where I'll leave you.<br> Time to stretch, gents.<br> I can believe a fellow<br> can ride here...<br> ...with his liver not turned white.<br> Yeah. A fellow can even think about<br> settling down and getting married.<br> Take cover!<br> What are you shooting at?<br> I saw something move.<br> Save your ammunition!<br> Blast you and that murdering Cochise<br> both. We'll be slaughtered.<br> Shut up!<br> Keep down under cover, everybody!<br> Now listen to me.<br> This isn't Cochise.<br> It's a band of renegade Indians.<br> There're a few of them<br> or they'd be rushing us.<br> They're very badly armed too.<br> What they want is our guns.<br> Well, we're pinned here.<br> They're waiting for night.<br> So what do we do?<br> Wait to be butchered in the dark?<br> Shut up!<br> Who's a good shot?<br> I'm not bad. Here.<br> When I yell, you and this fellow<br> start firing into the hill.<br> Lonergan, you cover the bank.<br> I'm coming upstream.<br> - What do you do?<br> - Send smoke signals.<br> All right, start shooting!<br> How many rounds you got left?<br> Two.<br> One.<br> Those signal of Jeffords<br> did us a lot of good...<br> ...a lot of good.<br> Listen!<br> Apaches protecting Americans!<br> I lived to see it!<br> Remember to talk about<br> it back in Tucson.<br> Twelve days.<br> I think it goes well.<br> There are many good signals.<br> It has gone well for twelve days.<br> I still wait to be glad.<br> Now you will forget<br> about peace and war.<br> Think only of your bride.<br> Is the ceremony a long one?<br> No...<br> ...with us the ceremony of<br> love takes place here.<br> The rest is small.<br> Let the bride come here.<br> The time has come.<br> Let the groom take his<br> place beside her.<br> Your left hand.<br> Your right hand.<br> Kneel down upon the earth.<br> Now your blood mixes.<br> Now for you there is no rain...<br> ...for one is shelter to the other.<br> Now for you there is no cold...<br> ...for one is warmth to the other.<br> Now there is no loneliness...<br> ...now forever,<br> there is no loneliness.<br> There are two bodies but now<br> there is but one blood in both.<br> Go now. Ride the white horses<br> to your secret place.<br> Look.<br> The evening is full and happy for us.<br> We will listen to the brook...<br> ...all through the night.<br> And listen to the bells.<br> It's as though they are<br> singing in my heart.<br> Sixteen stones.<br> I know of the attack<br> on the stage coach.<br> It was Geronimo.<br> We trailed him two days but<br> he crossed into Mexico.<br> You did not follow?<br> We wanted to, but we did not.<br> Good...<br> ...we will protect all the whites<br> leaving Tucson and Fort Bowie.<br> Also we will guard Apache Pass.<br> Let the whites break the peace.<br> It must not be Indians...<br> ...not even bad Indians.<br> - You are asleep?<br> - No.<br> I'm quiet because I'm happy.<br> I'm afraid if I open my mouth,<br> my happiness will...<br> ...will rush out in a<br> funny noise like...<br> ...Yahoo!<br> What does that mean?<br> It is an American word?<br> I think Adam said it when he<br> opened his eyes and saw Eve.<br> Who are they?<br> Don't you know?<br> The world is so big and<br> I know so little.<br> Sometime...<br> ...will you grow tired of me<br> and go back to your people?<br> That is a bad thought, Sonseeahray.<br> Never think it again.<br> You are my people.<br> Will you tell me that often?<br> Each day of our life together<br> I'll tell it to you.<br> I'll always remember the<br> moments of these days.<br> We will remember them together.<br> In the quiet of the nights<br> we will talk of them a little.<br> We will see our children ride<br> white horses, maybe.<br> I can do better myself.<br> By the time he is a grown man,<br> he will know how.<br> What is it?<br> I found this one up the canyon.<br> He had this.<br> I know this boy, Cochise.<br> Hello. You're Ben Slade's boy,<br> aren't you?<br> Yeah, Captain Jeffords. I've been<br> praying you'd be up here.<br> Keep calm. No one will hurt you.<br> Did you lose your way?<br> Not exactly.<br> You're the one who said these<br> Apaches wanted peace.<br> It's not peaceful when they steal.<br> What got stolen?<br> Two young colts of mine. Beauties.<br> Swiped night before last by Apaches.<br> I tracked them all day...<br> ...followed their tracks<br> up the canyon.<br> I ended up out there<br> at dark last night.<br> Then that redskin<br> jumped me in the morning.<br> None of my people took them.<br> The boy lies.<br> Cochise.<br> I know this boy's father<br> hates the Apaches.<br> We have to show that he's wrong.<br> Maybe you have men like Geronimo<br> who would betray you.<br> You speak wisely.<br> I will see these horse signs.<br> All right, bub.<br> We'll mosey down and take a look.<br> See them yet, bub?<br> Right around here, Captain.<br> You call the boy 'bub'.<br> Is it his name?<br> No, it's just to be friendly.<br> Here they are, Captain.<br> Don't shoot till my boy<br> gets out of the way.<br> Cochise, they'll kill you. Run!<br> Get Cochise!<br> Run! Sonseeahray, run!<br> The big one is Cochise.<br> Somebody give me a gun.<br> Watch out, son,<br> you stay clear of this.<br> Slade, stay out of line.<br> We can't shoot.<br> He's out of arrows!<br> He got away! It's a bust!<br> Our whole plan's a bust!<br> I'm heading for Mexico.<br> The military will be after us, too.<br> What are you standing there for?<br> Come on.<br> Sonseeahray.<br> Sonsee...<br> No!<br> God!<br> Are you bad hurt?<br> She's dead, Cochise.<br> There is one who still lives.<br> Give me a knife and bring him to me.<br> It will not be done.<br> - Bring him to me!<br> - No.<br> It will not be done.<br> There are some things<br> a man cannot bear.<br> Do you hear me?<br> This peace is a lie!<br> They don't want peace!<br> It is not a lie. I will not<br> let you make it a lie.<br> Did you think peace would come easy?<br> You, who taught me so well.<br> Is it my brother who asks<br> me to spit on my word?<br> Why do you speak to me?<br> Speak to her!<br> When she hears, I'll hear.<br> You will hear me now!<br> You'll bear this.<br> This was not done by the military.<br> Geronimo broke the peace<br> no less than these whites.<br> As I bear the murder of my people,<br> so you will bear...<br> ...the murder of your wife.<br> I am Cochise! I do not betray<br> my people or their children.<br> No none on my territory<br> will open war again.<br> Not even you.<br> I have given my permission.<br> They wanted to see you.<br> Tom...<br> ...we've come to pay<br> our respects, Tom.<br> Thank you, Milt.<br> We rounded up ever man<br> connected with the ambush.<br> They're going to pay<br> the full penalty for what they done.<br> Jeffords...<br> ...nothing can compensate you for<br> the terrible thing that happened.<br> But your loss has brought our people<br> together in the will to peace.<br> Without that will, treaties are<br> worth little or nothing.<br> His words meant very little to<br> me then, but as time passed...<br> ...I came to know that the<br> death of Sonseeahray...<br> ...put a seal upon the peace.<br> From that day on,<br> wherever I went...<br> ...in cities, among the Apaches,<br> in the mountains...<br> ...I always remembered...<br> ...my wife was with me.<br>
