I won't have any more.<br> I won't have any more.<br> Your brothers are in the next room.<br> They've a proposition to make you.<br> A business proposition.<br> They assure me it's a good one.<br> I'd like...<br> I'd advise you to take it.<br> Come in.<br> Hello, Joe.<br> Joe.<br> - Joe.<br> I told him and I tell you, Ben.<br> I'll stand for no trouble.<br> There won't be any trouble.<br> We don't want any and...<br> ...l'm sure Joe doesn't.<br> I'll give you ten minutes.<br> - Fine.<br> You look good, Joe.<br> I'm glad to see it wasn't<br> too tough on you.<br> I know it wasn't easy but...<br> The Governor said you'd a<br> proposition for me.<br> He told me to take it.<br> What? Before you'd even heard it?<br> Why he should know better than that.<br> Besides, this is a family<br> matter, Joe.<br> We're still your brothers.<br> - Just tell me the proposition.<br> All right.<br> You see, Joe...<br> ...there have been<br> a lot of changes...<br> ...since you went in.<br> I can see some of them right here.<br> What kind of...<br> - I'll do the talking, Denny.<br> Sure, Ben.<br> That's one of the changes.<br> The other is that we run<br> the ranch from town now.<br> It's gotten too big to<br> operate from home.<br> What did you do with my mother?<br> You know, Joe, she doesn't like town.<br> She went back to her own people,<br> Joe. That's all she wanted.<br> Anything else we'd have done it,<br> just as we will for you, but...<br> ...I think you ought to realize...<br> ...that we've got different<br> responsibilities now.<br> Deveraux Ranch isn't just cattle<br> any more. We've got...<br> ...oil leases, mineral rights...<br> ...and stockholders<br> we have to protect.<br> Just tell me the deal.<br> All right, I'll tell you the deal.<br> It's Oregon. Brand new territory.<br> We'll buy you a spread, stock it and<br> cover your losses for three years.<br> Or else?<br> There is no 'or else'.<br> That's it.<br> I think that'll get you started.<br> What if I don't like Oregon?<br> You'll like it.<br> - I hear it's real nice country.<br> We worked it out for you<br> the best we could, but...<br> ...if there's something else...<br> There is something else.<br> Three years.<br> Three years out of my life.<br> Three years I spent in<br> that stinking jail.<br> Can you give me back those?<br> No. Not even if I had<br> them to give you.<br> I lost mine sweating out chores<br> for Pa before you ever born.<br> I'm not crying about them.<br> I'm just telling you.<br> You've got our offer and<br> you've got our money.<br> The train goes through here at six.<br> Be on it and the deal stands.<br> That's not very smart, Joe.<br> But the rest of the deal stands<br> if you make that train.<br> He's real hot, ain't he?<br> He'll cool down.<br> When he does, he'll take<br> the deal. He's too smart.<br> Ain't that right, Ben?<br> - I don't know.<br> Anybody that throws 10,000 dollars<br> in a spittoon makes me nervous.<br> Pick it up.<br> For the price, he'll get<br> you three and back.<br> You sure you want that saddle?<br> Another couple of dollars and<br> I give you a better one.<br> What's your hurry?<br> Ben said find out where he was going.<br> I know where he's going.<br> Get on your horse, fellow!<br> Joseph! It is you.<br> Hello, Two Moons.<br> The gods, they smile on us this day.<br> I guess they do.<br> You missed me about three inches.<br> Maybe you're getting old.<br> If I want to hit you, I hit you.<br> You come home to stay, Joseph?<br> I don't know.<br> Your mother is at the meeting<br> place of our people.<br> Is she all right?<br> - She is the same.<br> She waits for you.<br> Yeah.<br> There's something else<br> I got to settle first.<br> You are alone. I have 20 men...<br> - And have your tribe destroyed?<br> No.<br> Where you go?<br> To the home place.<br> - Good.<br> Talk to Running Wolf.<br> - I'm not talk to anybody.<br> The Old Man's dead.<br> Do you listen to that<br> medicine man too?<br> At night, I hear wolf calls.<br> - You always hear wolves.<br> Pa never let anybody kill<br> them, you know that.<br> You want to ride in with me?<br> Well?<br> It is fitting you go alone, Joseph.<br> Superstitious old fool.<br> Hello, Pa.<br> I came back.<br> The old men said you wouldn't<br> rest easy till I did.<br> I've heard the medicine men...<br> ...think you're running<br> the hills with the wolves.<br> Maybe you are at that.<br> What should I do, Pa?<br> Have you a sign for me?<br> Or are you to let me figure...?<br> Hold him still.<br> Just brand him, don't barbecue him.<br> 'Cmo est, seor?<br> - Muy bien, Francisco'.<br> 'Seor' Matt...<br> ...all goes well?<br> - Yes.<br> We'll have the other camps<br> cleaned up by sundown.<br> Here too.<br> We'll drive the beef herd<br> toward home tomorrow.<br> Take them slow.<br> They're running off stock<br> on the east range.<br> Johnny was riding herd last night.<br> They shot his horse under him.<br> He walked and told Two Moons.<br> - Ben!<br> Get a horse!<br> You want I get some boys?<br> - No, we'll handle it.<br> Not a sign of them.<br> They rode in the stream.<br> You can't tell where they went.<br> Horse slipped, no?<br> - Which way, do you think?<br> Let's go.<br> Two, three...<br> ...four, five, I count, Pa.<br> Six!<br> It's Pa!<br> Get out of here!<br> Let's go!<br> Get out of there!<br> Get up, you're not hurt.<br> Let this steer loose.<br> Could you change the brand<br> without botching it?<br> I've seen these two before.<br> We fired them last year.<br> They're no good.<br> Well?<br> We didn't mean nothing, Pa.<br> Just a couple little old steers.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know.<br> We needed the money, that's why.<br> Money? But you got money.<br> If you mean that lousy<br> 40 a month...<br> Don't ever use that tone to me.<br> - Pa, we didn't mean nothing.<br> No, you didn't. You figured you've<br> steal some cattle and sell them.<br> Anybody would know that brand,<br> even though it had been raised.<br> But you figured nobody...<br> - Pa, we didn't even think of that.<br> I don't think you did.<br> You two together couldn't<br> have figure that out.<br> But somebody did?<br> Who put you up to it?<br> Nobody.<br> It doesn't make any difference.<br> You did it.<br> Be sure it wouldn't be a secret...<br> ...you had to drag these<br> two lunkheads in with you.<br> They no talk.<br> Let them be. They're not to blame.<br> Just these two.<br> What should I do with'em?<br> They were caught rustling cattle<br> and changing the brands.<br> If you notify the Sheriff<br> the whole state'll know it.<br> We could hang them or shoot them...<br> - Cut it, Pa.<br> He thinks I'm fooling.<br> Lots of fellows felt that way<br> until we taught them...<br> ...that you don't steal cattle<br> from Deveraux Ranch.<br> But the cattle are as much<br> yours as they are mine.<br> And they would have<br> been yours too, but...<br> What do you think, Ben?<br> You don't pay them enough.<br> Or you either, Ben?<br> They get the same as you.<br> If you ask me, I'll tell you, you<br> get twice what you're worth.<br> There ain't a man living who can<br> say that he stole cattle from me...<br> ...but you two mushheads thought...<br> You wanted them so bad,<br> take them and get out.<br> The money you get for them'll keep<br> you until you can steal more.<br> But remember this: . .<br> ...don't steal them from here.<br> We can't let him do this.<br> Why not?<br> I warned them they were<br> only asking for trouble.<br> Pa, you don't mean this.<br> They're your own sons.<br> They're a couple of cheap<br> tinhorn cattle thieves.<br> Two men are dead because of them.<br> - You just can't do it.<br> I did. Let go, son.<br> You should have had<br> all this yesterday.<br> If I'd been half smart I never<br> would've let you see it.<br> I don't know why it is but<br> every wife thinks...<br> What are you trying to do, kill me?<br> - Finish the telling.<br> Nothing to tell. I just<br> sent them packing.<br> Money they said they wanted.<br> I pay'em, don't I?<br> They have all they needs on<br> the ranch, haven't they?<br> Haven't they?<br> Perhaps.<br> But I don't think it<br> is money they need.<br> They were stealing cattle to get it.<br> What is it they do need?<br> They are not my sons.<br> It is difficult to say.<br> I think it is you, my husband.<br> You have never given them<br> anything of yourself.<br> That's a lot of! That kind of talk!<br> I got a big ranch to run.<br> The biggest of the country.<br> Besides, I've built it all<br> up for'em, haven't I?<br> Al right, I built it for myself.<br> But it's theirs when I die.<br> Suppose I haven't given'em time.<br> Does that mean they've to grow<br> up to be cattle thieves?<br> You are the father.<br> They want to be part of you.<br> If you do not give yourself,<br> they take.<br> Even if it means stealing<br> something that is yours.<br> That's Indian talk, squaw talk.<br> I don't understand you.<br> You understand.<br> That's what makes you angry.<br> That and because you've sent'em away.<br> They are your sons.<br> They're not yours. If Joe had<br> done a thing like that...<br> Because they're not, I have tried<br> to love them as much as my own.<br> And you have too.<br> That must take a power. I know<br> nothing about. But as I say, Joe...<br> Joe wouldn't do that.<br> He's my son, yet I don't<br> know what he would do.<br> He is yours, and you do not.<br> Bring them back.<br> - No!<br> I sent'em away and that's that.<br> Let me.<br> Sore at me?<br> No.<br> It's only because<br> I don't understand.<br> You didn't get a very good bargain,<br> my little Princess.<br> I have never regretted it.<br> No all these years you haven't?<br> How have you stayed so beautiful?<br> Am I?<br> Still?<br> You know, the first day I saw you...<br> ...riding that little paint pony...<br> ...with the antelope skin<br> shirt and the beads...<br> ...and the feather in your hair...<br> ...I though there was nothing<br> in the world so beautiful.<br> I didn't know the half.<br> We have guests for dinner.<br> - Send them home.<br> But they're already here.<br> You go downstairs and pacify them.<br> - Without you?<br> What's the matter? Are you afraid?<br> - No.<br> They'll bow and smile<br> and be very polite.<br> They'd better.<br> They know that too.<br> Are you afraid of them?<br> I'm afraid of no one,<br> but you my husband.<br> Princess.<br> That sounds like it has<br> a little of the old Irish.<br> Are you sure you haven't any<br> Irishman before I came along?<br> There is no other Irishman<br> like you, my husband.<br> Princess.<br> Did you?<br> - No!<br> I...<br> Please don't.<br> Matt!<br> 'Seora' Deveraux.<br> We've been waiting for you.<br> - Horace, my apologies. Sorry.<br> Clem, nice to see you.<br> Where's Grace? Couldn't she come?<br> It's her back again.<br> Hasn't been out in a week.<br> Must be two weeks<br> since I've seen her.<br> I haven't met this young lady.<br> I should never forget it if I had.<br> Of course you have, uncle Matt.<br> It's not Barbara!<br> Why it can't Barbara, when you<br> went east you were this high.<br> I was a little taller than that.<br> Good evening, 'Seora'.<br> Not very much.<br> My, if the years had just done<br> for me what they've done...<br> You've met my sons.<br> - Yes, all four of them.<br> I expected you two would still<br> be out with the cattle.<br> I thought they ought to be<br> here, so I brought them in.<br> I see.<br> Are they entertaining you properly?<br> They've been most gallant.<br> - A fine set of boys, Matt.<br> Yes, Madame Deveraux taught<br> them their manners.<br> If they smack of the range<br> still, that's my fault.<br> I think they resemble you<br> amazingly, Uncle Matt.<br> So handsome and charming.<br> - Your manners weren't neglected.<br> Shall we go in to dinner?<br> - May I?<br> Joe.<br> What about them?<br> It was tough, but I got'em drunk...<br> - I'm not talking about that.<br> You heard what I said'em...<br> - You were mad, Pa.<br> I figured once you...<br> - You figured!<br> You've more courage that brains.<br> One of these days...<br> - Not tonight, Pa.<br> You got your good shirt on.<br> Besides, I think I could<br> lick you anyway.<br> That'll be the day, son.<br> Get in there.<br> Dear, that old heifer<br> never did come back.<br> That was in the days before<br> I had a seat in my pants.<br> But they were pretty good<br> days at that, eh Horace?<br> What are you eating, Uncle Matt?<br> - These?<br> They're pickled cactus grapes.<br> Cactus grapes?<br> - Yeah.<br> I don't think I've seen'em.<br> - They don't have'em in the east.<br> They're wonderful appetizers, eh Ben?<br> Yes, If you like them.<br> They're real good, Barbara.<br> Try it.<br> Don't!<br> It's a Mexican pepper.<br> It'll burn the roof of your mouth.<br> One of Pa's funny jokes.<br> The Mexicans grind them for cayenne.<br> Is that right, Uncle Matt?<br> Yes.<br> They're not that hot though.<br> Joe has a tendency to<br> be tender hearted.<br> But you eat them.<br> I eat anything that doesn't eat me.<br> Not bad at all.<br> Holly smoke!<br> Not hot?<br> A little!<br> A little!<br> She would deny it if it tore her<br> mouth off. Quite girl, Horace.<br> Why I didn't see before her, if<br> she's been here for a month?<br> If you came in town often<br> you might have.<br> I had to bring her out here.<br> - He doesn't come to town.<br> You've to run a ranch from the back<br> of the horse, not from a chair.<br> You find out about<br> mineral rights, though...<br> ...and beef prices.<br> I get as good a price as<br> the next man, isn't right, Ben?<br> No.<br> I can show you the figures.<br> The boys are given me a bad time<br> tonight. Where did you get tem?<br> I asked them.<br> Most of them are averaging a 100%<br> and a half a pound better'n we are.<br> What should we do?<br> Open an office in town,<br> like the rest of them.<br> Watch Chicago prices and...<br> - And who would run the office?<br> What about Ben? He could do it.<br> I don't know, he hadn't<br> mentioned it to me.<br> Now...<br> - Wait a minute!<br> Let Ben talk for himself.<br> Go ahead, Ben.<br> Mr. Deveraux...<br> ...our friends need more wine.<br> My apologies, Madam.<br> And you, Barbara.<br> 'Vino'.<br> Sometimes the task of<br> managing four sons, is...<br> They look like they're able<br> to take care themselves.<br> They've been raised to.<br> Why wouldn't you to let one of<br> them take over for you in town?<br> Barbara, I think we should.<br> Let her alone, she's perfectly right.<br> Matter of fact, I think that<br> Ben could take over in town.<br> That means giving up part of<br> the control of the ranch to him.<br> And you don't like that a bit.<br> And what's more, I won't do it.<br> I tell myself he's not ready for it.<br> That's one problem when you<br> raise a flock of sons.<br> You must remember when some<br> man gains your hand in marriage.<br> Remember to have daughters.<br> Simpler...<br> ...and much prettier.<br> I would be better advise in the<br> choice of who's to be their father.<br> The pepper was hotter than I thought.<br> What's that?<br> - Cold milk.<br> It's the only thing tha'll<br> cool that pepper.<br> They burn like a fire.<br> I thought my teeth would melt!<br> Heavens!<br> Now if the rest of me'd cool off.<br> - Shall we walk in the patio?<br> The wind's died down.<br> You don't have to be afraid.<br> Now...<br> ...why should I be afraid?<br> I don't know.<br> They think that we'd turned<br> out to be quite a family.<br> That's way you came<br> out here, isn't it?<br> I suppose so.<br> Well, do we come up<br> to our reputation.<br> Your father certainly does.<br> Does he always act like that?<br> - Pretty much.<br> He's a bearcat, ain't he?<br> He's and old tyrant.<br> But you're crazy about<br> him, aren't you?<br> Why...<br> ...yeah.<br> Yeah, I guess I am.<br> You're not afraid of him.<br> The rest of them are.<br> I don't know.<br> - I do.<br> Ben is, and so are the others. And<br> so is my father. It's ridiculous.<br> It was the peppers that<br> made you jump him.<br> He's stubborn and spoiled and mean.<br> You all let him get away with it.<br> - You like him too, don't you?<br> They said in town you'd turned<br> out to be smartest of the lot.<br> What else did they say?<br> That you'd inherited all his charm.<br> But I don't see it.<br> Look closer.<br> Was that to maintain<br> the Deveraux tradition?<br> No.<br> Maybe we'd better go back in.<br> Joe, I want you.<br> There's something<br> wrong with the herd.<br> Mrs. Deveraux'll show you the rooms.<br> - All right.<br> Take off that Sunday's clothes.<br> We're going to work.<br> Loco weed, maybe?<br> They'd be all swelled up.<br> The tongues looks funny though.<br> They got funny looking tongues<br> even when they ain't dead.<br> How may do you think?<br> Must be thirty eight or forty.<br> Pa!<br> This water smells funny.<br> What?<br> Tastes funny too.<br> Like when you was a kid and<br> one put a penny in your mouth.<br> Like copper.<br> They're dumping stuff in this stream.<br> That may be it. What do<br> they call that...<br> Whatever it is. They're dumping it<br> in my stream. Get your horses.<br> Where we going?<br> To the copper works.<br> Where do you think we're going?<br> Keep the cattle away<br> from this stream.<br> The copper mine!<br> - What of it?<br> We haven't slept.<br> - You didn't think of that...<br> ...when you were in the east<br> range changing the brand.<br> All right, rest them.<br> Good coffee...<br> ...with a stick in it.<br> What you aiming to do, Pa?<br> Stop them.<br> Big outfit.<br> - So we are. Are you nervous?<br> Nope. I just thought we might<br> get smart for once.<br> How?<br> Get some law in.<br> Law!<br> - Get an injunction and stop them.<br> They're on our land.<br> - Sure, that's right.<br> In the mean time we lose four<br> maybe five hundred head of...<br> What's the matter with you?<br> That was a wolf.<br> - He wasn't doing any harm.<br> He'll kill a steer.<br> - Only if he's a hungry.<br> I've told you...<br> - How long as he's around...<br> ...a coyote won't come<br> within 10 miles.<br> They'll pull down an animal<br> just to be doing something.<br> The river's full of it.<br> It's from the mine all right.<br> Hold it.<br> Sorry boys, not today.<br> I'm Matt Deveraux.<br> I want to see McAndrews.<br> Not today. They're paying off<br> up there. I got my orders.<br> I don't care what you got.<br> I'm going up there. Stand aside.<br> You ain't going through<br> this gate, don't try...<br> Better get McAndrews.<br> Round up the other boys.<br> - Sure, boss.<br> Deveraux...<br> ...good to see you.<br> You don't come here very often.<br> - I'm here now. I'll tell you why.<br> I lost forty head of cattle.<br> That stuff you're pouring<br> poisoned'em.<br> Poison!<br> That doesn't sound right.<br> A stream's supposed to purify<br> itself every few yards...<br> I don't know what a stream<br> is supposed to do...<br> ...but it's killing my cattle<br> and want it stopped.<br> Where you going, boys?<br> I can see how you might be annoyed.<br> Tell you what you'd better do.<br> You keep your herds away from<br> the stream for a while...<br> ...and I'll write to<br> the office in Chicago...<br> ...and if they'll stand still for...<br> - Listen to me.<br> Don't worry about<br> writing any letters...<br> ...or about my moving my cattle.<br> The river is on my land.<br> You're on my land.<br> You close this operation down...<br> ...till you clean that stream<br> or I'll close it for you.<br> And just how do you<br> propose to do that?<br> The first thing I'll do...<br> ...is get an injunction against<br> you in the Federal Court.<br> Then I'll get a Deputy<br> Marshal to enforce it.<br> That's a fair idea.<br> If you did that, you'd throw<br> all these men out of work.<br> They wouldn't like that.<br> - You're breaking our hearts.<br> Another thing.<br> Remember that the Government's<br> got contracts for our ore.<br> You think the court would<br> give you an injunction?<br> That's the second time I've wound<br> up with a busted head.<br> The first time when I forgot to<br> check the mineral rights...<br> ...and the second, of course, when...<br> ...I didn't realize that they<br> wouldn't send a fool in charge.<br> Coming from you, that's a<br> very pleasant compliment.<br> We'll just see who's right.<br> Now listen to me, you...<br> ...pasty-faced Eastern tinhorn.<br> You close this operation down or<br> I'll pull it down around your ears.<br> I'll be waiting here for you.<br> You're right about one thing.<br> The company didn't send<br> me here to be buffaloed...<br> ...by a loudmouth farmer with a<br> sqaw for a wife and a half...<br> Go ahead...<br> ...pull it.<br> Draw and I'll blow your head off.<br> Cut it out, Joe. Put it away, Ben.<br> There's not going to be any<br> shooting. You've been warned.<br> Close it down or we'll be back. If I<br> come back I'll be looking for you.<br> Let's go.<br> Stay close to me. Walk slow.<br> Get them!<br> We ain't got a chance, Pa.<br> - Shut up!<br> Rush them, you fools! Rush them!<br> Shoot at their feet!<br> Make for the horses!<br> Wreck it! Tear it down!<br> Go!<br> All here?<br> - Some hurt, not bad.<br> Where'd you come from?<br> I think maybe trouble.<br> We follow you.<br> We wait, hear shooting, we come.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> They're not going to like that, Pa.<br> - I'll bet they're not.<br> They'll think twice before<br> they dump in my stream.<br> They won't think twice about<br> starting legal action.<br> That's not my worry.<br> Let Lawton about that.<br> Ride back to the ranch and tell him.<br> - Right.<br> If he's not there, go into<br> town and find him.<br> I'll ride in with you.<br> Me too.<br> - You're going to ride herd.<br> We got keep the stock<br> away from the stream.<br> Holy crow, don't he ever give up?<br> What're you doing here?<br> Looking at your horses.<br> Isn't it allowed?<br> You mean you were there with King?<br> He's a stallion.<br> He could kick your head.<br> You sound as if you wished he had.<br> He happens to know a lady<br> when he sees one.<br> Which is more than you can<br> say for the rest of us.<br> You're saying it, not me.<br> Where's Lawton, up at the main house?<br> No, he went into town with<br> Dad early this morning.<br> What about you?<br> I just didn't feel like<br> getting up that early.<br> You didn't figure we might<br> be riding today, did you?<br> Well of all the gall.<br> For your information I've already<br> asked for someone to drive me in.<br> Yes.<br> Might I ask how you<br> happen to be here?<br> Me.<br> Pa wanted me to see Lawton and I...<br> ...just had a feeling that<br> you might still be here.<br> And you're, aren't you?<br> Yes, I'm here.<br> And you did figure that I might<br> ride in, didn't you?<br> Why?<br> Why did you ride in?<br> Ma, tell Pa I'll try and make<br> it back by suppertime.<br> I've got a feeling your mother<br> doesn't approve of this.<br> Or me either.<br> - Lf she didn't, she'd say so.<br> She never says anything.<br> She always seems to know just<br> what you're thinking.<br> I thought that too when I was a kid.<br> It's only because she's Indian.<br> I'd almost forgotten that.<br> But everyone call her 'Seora'. Why?<br> People like to pretend she's<br> Spanish, thinking it looks better.<br> Pa likes it.<br> Pa don't give a rip what they think.<br> - What do you mean?<br> You know.<br> If I did, I wouldn't have asked you.<br> Well.<br> Though you've been away...<br> ...you should know that a white man<br> doesn't marry and Indian...<br> ...even the daughter of a chief.<br> They call him a sqawman<br> and his kids breeds.<br> I'm a half-breed.<br> All right.<br> But does anyone call you that?<br> No since my first day in school.<br> But it still bothers you.<br> - No, why should it?<br> Yeah...<br> ...I guess it does sometimes.<br> Was your mother really<br> the daughter of a chief?<br> He ran this whole territory.<br> I was named after his father...<br> ...Tuekakas, Chief Joseph.<br> - I've heard of him.<br> They didn't want Pa<br> to marry the Princess.<br> A wild Irishman with a<br> few head of cattle...<br> ...and three motherless kids.<br> The old chiefs were opposed to him.<br> So?<br> Pa'd tell it to you with<br> the trimmings...<br> ...how he, rassled a bear,<br> and whipped six braves...<br> ...so they allowed him<br> to marry the Princess.<br> Wonderful.<br> I'll bet he did it all too.<br> What about his family?<br> I never did hear much about them.<br> Ellen, his first wife, died right<br> after they came out here.<br> Came out from where?<br> - I don't know.<br> East, I guess.<br> His father, a farmer, left Ireland<br> during the famine.<br> Dirt farmer or something.<br> Were kicked by a mule when<br> Pa was just a pup and...<br> What're you laughing at?<br> I thought you were worried<br> about being an Indian.<br> You just don't like being Irish.<br> If I were you I wouldn't<br> try to rush things.<br> Let me talk to Deveraux<br> myself and see if...<br> There's one of them now.<br> Yes, so it is.<br> Isn't that your daughter?<br> Yes, it is.<br> You're making too much<br> out of this, Horace.<br> They're a little hot under the<br> collar, but they'll calm down.<br> Talk to'em nicely and they'll<br> settle. They want no trouble.<br> I tell you they're going to<br> sue you. They're mad, Matt.<br> You wrecked a building...<br> ...banged up half their crew.<br> - They killed 40 of my cattle.<br> What should I do, kiss'em?<br> I'll pay for the damages,<br> if they're fair.<br> And if they put in a sump and<br> stop polluting my stream.<br> Going to court is a waste<br> of their time and mine.<br> They don't care about that.<br> They're out to get you.<br> This is a big company.<br> They dislike the shooting<br> in their property.<br> They'll make an example of you.<br> Do you think they can?<br> Well.<br> That depends on what<br> happens in court.<br> What lawyers they bring in and...<br> ...who the judge is. You know.<br> Well...<br> ...you could do something about that.<br> This is a federal case...<br> ...with eastern lawyers,<br> the papers will pick it up.<br> If this was just a...<br> ...local thing, we could handle it.<br> - Horace...<br> ...I don't know but...<br> ...something sounds sour to me.<br> You made the wrong move<br> with the wrong people.<br> I've mad a lot of wrong<br> moves, Horace.<br> You know, it isn't that,<br> it's you, Horace.<br> Sometimes you helped,<br> sometimes you couldn't.<br> That's all right, but...<br> ...you're not even pretending<br> now that you want to help me.<br> You could appoint the judge,<br> couldn't you, Horace?<br> I suppose I could.<br> It couldn't be quite ethical but...<br> - Never mind about that.<br> Let's talk about you and me.<br> You want something.<br> What is it? What do you want?<br> I want your son Joe to stay<br> away from my daughter.<br> I ought to kill you,<br> Horace, right now.<br> No! No!<br> Not you. After all these years.<br> Matt!<br> I don't care what the newspaper<br> and the town say...<br> ...or the fact that Lawton's wife is<br> sick every time we ask them.<br> You!<br> You never could understand<br> why I married her.<br> And you never liked this country<br> out here, did you, Horace?<br> That's why you sent<br> the girl back east.<br> To get her away from<br> the dust, the cattle...<br> ...the Indians and the half-breed.<br> - Matt, don't.<br> I like the boy, but...<br> ...this is something that's born<br> and bred in me, I'm 56.<br> I tried to change but...<br> - You're 56...<br> ...and you're Governor of the state!<br> And who made you Governor?<br> I took you off of a...<br> ...accountant's stool and pulled a<br> pencil out from behind your ear...<br> ...and made you a politician.<br> I made you mayor.<br> I sent you to Congress and<br> I put you in that chair.<br> Fifty-six years...<br> Fifty six, you owe me thirty of them.<br> You're right, I do.<br> You've done everything but change me.<br> I wish you had.<br> And maybe I will.<br> Maybe I will. I can still pull that<br> chair right out from under you.<br> Maybe I will.<br> But I'll do something else first.<br> I'll tell my boy that if he wants<br> your girl, to take her...<br> ...if he has to pull her out of the<br> house by the hair of her head.<br> Dead beat?<br> I guess so.<br> I'll show you something.<br> Go on.<br> That's wonderful. And cold!<br> - Comes from away up.<br> It's beautiful here.<br> How did you ever find it?<br> I've known it since I was a kid.<br> This is where Pa'd his first<br> powwow with the tribes...<br> ...and saw my mother.<br> There used to be a stone<br> that marked the place...<br> ...where the old Indians made<br> a deal for the land.<br> I don't come frequently.<br> - Don't you come here often?<br> No, it's sort of out of the way.<br> - Then why did you bring me here?<br> I don't know. We were<br> out this way and...<br> No other reason?<br> Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.<br> I just don't understand you.<br> Four days ago you behaved as if I<br> were a girl in a dance hall...<br> ...and now...<br> Four days ago I wasn't<br> in love with you.<br> Was it that hard to say?<br> You don't know about what<br> you're finding out...<br> ...of what they'll say...<br> - Yes I do.<br> Just as your mother did.<br> Should I go in and talk to him?<br> - Nope.<br> Don't you start getting honourable.<br> I need time to work on him.<br> Unless you really want to?<br> I'd rather rassle a bear.<br> Joe!<br> Come in here, this concerns you too.<br> The Mining Company has filed a<br> claim against us in the Court.<br> Clem thinks we're in real trouble.<br> You'll be if they get a<br> judgment against you.<br> I don't know if they...<br> - Then why bother with it?<br> Because no lawyer guarantees<br> what a jury'll do.<br> As I said, if Horace were<br> appointing the Judge...<br> He isn't, and I'm not<br> gonna ask him to.<br> I still think we've got a good case.<br> If I didn't I've told you so...<br> ...but I want you to be protected<br> against any eventuality.<br> You insure yourself against<br> accident and death.<br> No.<br> What is it, Mr. Lawton?<br> If he splits the property<br> between you...<br> ...he won't be the sole owner.<br> - You're wasting your time...<br> ...because he doesn't trust any of<br> us with more that 40 a month!<br> Sit down!<br> What about Ma, couldn't she...?<br> No, Joseph.<br> Well...<br> You see, Joe, it's...<br> The government doesn't allow<br> an Indian to hold land.<br> What about me?<br> That's different, you can.<br> He won't turn a thing over to us.<br> - I'll make decisions around here!<br> Get out of here! I'll think it over.<br> Joe!<br> Come here, will you?<br> There's something I want to ask you.<br> Yes, Pa?<br> Never mind. It's not important.<br> I take it the death of these 40<br> cattle was important to you?<br> The death of one cow is important<br> to a cattleman, sonny.<br> Important enough to send<br> you to the mine...<br> ...where 12 men were injured?<br> Yep.<br> You consider 40 cattle more<br> important than the lives...<br> ...of 12 men occupied in making...<br> - Objection.<br> Prosecution is trying...<br> - Let him go.<br> I'm willing to answer any questions.<br> That sound like pure<br> nonsense, sonny...<br> ...but I know the difference<br> between cattle and people...<br> ...as any man can tell you.<br> Thank you.<br> How many head of cattle have you<br> at this time, Mr. Deveraux?<br> 45,000 or 50,000.<br> You don't know exactly?<br> There're the books of my Ranch.<br> Why don't you look it up?<br> I don't want to look it up.<br> I want you to tell me.<br> Then you'd better change<br> the tone of your voice, sonny.<br> Will you ask for a directly answer?<br> - I already have.<br> Mr. Van Cleve, unless you have a<br> a specific reason for pursuing...<br> ...the book...<br> - I've a specific reason.<br> The defense has stressed<br> the importance of 40 animals.<br> Yet the witness can't tell me...<br> - Objection.<br> Prosecution wants to discredit the<br> witness by indirect examination.<br> Sustained.<br> Your Honor, I don't understand<br> this legal hocus-pocus...<br> ...but I'm willing to tell this<br> fellow about my cattle.<br> I don't keep any books<br> in my head but...<br> ...every cow on my Ranch<br> is important to me.<br> Important to other people too.<br> I ship 10,000 head to Kansas<br> City every year.<br> My cows goes into every<br> city in the East.<br> It feeds over 200,000 people.<br> That's may line of work, sonny.<br> We're all very grateful for<br> this additional information.<br> But could we confine ourselves<br> to specific answers? Thank you.<br> You've stated you built up you<br> ranch over a period of 25 years?<br> Approximately.<br> During this time you've had<br> other disputes over...<br> ...prior claims and water rights?<br> - Plenty.<br> Were they settled in court?<br> - No.<br> This is the first time<br> I've ever been to court.<br> Usually the men I had to deal with...<br> ...were men enough to stand<br> up and argue it out.<br> I see.<br> Do you happen to remember the<br> name of Lucius Hennaberry?<br> Yes, I remember him.<br> Do you remember shooting<br> him in White's saloon?<br> In a fair fight.<br> Objection.<br> Your Honor, I can see no reason<br> for this line of question.<br> I demand.<br> - It's an integral part of the case.<br> If the Court allow me to proceed<br> I'll so demostrate.<br> Proceed.<br> Thank you, Sir.<br> The dispute between you and<br> Hennaberry was over a water right.<br> No. Not over water rights<br> just over water.<br> Luke said he was going to<br> water his herd on my ranch.<br> He didn't.<br> Judging from the results,<br> that seems obvious.<br> Water seems to play a important<br> part in your life.<br> I don't quite understand this.<br> Seeing as how you came here<br> on a train, all nice...<br> ...and comfortable like, why,<br> I can understand that.<br> But you see, I didn't.<br> I packed in here with a<br> wife and three kids.<br> The first year I lost my herd and<br> the second I lost my wife...<br> ...because there was no water.<br> Water's important to me like it is<br> to everybody else in the state.<br> Without water there'd be no state!<br> Your Honor, please...<br> - You asked me, I'll answer.<br> You can bet your hat water's<br> important to me...<br> ...as it is to everybody<br> else in the state.<br> Every drop on my ranch I either<br> dug for or channeled in.<br> When you're back on that train<br> riding out of here...<br> ...over the right of way<br> that I gave'em...<br> ...think it over.<br> I concede Mr. Deveraux's<br> contribution to his state...<br> ...but that does not give him<br> the right to flout the laws...<br> ...of this state.<br> - Object.<br> Sustained.<br> Just keep to direct questioning.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Do you remember the names<br> of Charlie Munger...<br> ...Red Dog Johnson,<br> or Carlos Ramirez?<br> No.<br> The incident may be<br> too trivial to recall.<br> But isn't it true that you summarily<br> hanged all these men...<br> ...on June...<br> - They were stealing cattle.<br> Did you just remind'em?<br> - I didn't ask'em their names.<br> You just hung them.<br> - They were thieves.<br> I see.<br> Wasn't Charles Malone<br> sheriff at that time?<br> I guess he was.<br> - Did you try to contact him?<br> No.<br> - Why not?<br> He was 40 miles away and drunk.<br> Do you know this for a fact?<br> - I knew Charlie Malone.<br> Have you ever, during your<br> years on Deveraux Ranch...<br> ...called in legal authorities?<br> - Lf I've needed them...<br> ...l've asked for them.<br> - Why didn't you ask for 'em...<br> ...two weeks ago?<br> - It wasn't necessary!<br> Order! Order!<br> If there's any more of this,<br> I'll see you in my chambers.<br> If you can't restrain yourself,<br> I hold you in contempt.<br> Proceed.<br> You say you've asked<br> for the authorities.<br> That's right.<br> - Did you attempt...<br> ...to notify the present<br> sheriff this time?<br> No.<br> - Why not?<br> I didn't think it was necessary.<br> You stated that it was<br> your intention...<br> ...to discuss with McAndrews and<br> arrive at a sensible solution.<br> Do you still say that<br> this was your intent?<br> Yes.<br> - Then how it happened...<br> ...that 20 minutes after<br> you arrive at the mine...<br> ...your formal appear<br> with 30 armed men?<br> Maybe he thought there<br> was any trouble.<br> Did he know there was any and<br> you warned to be there?<br> No, I did not.<br> I see.<br> Is it customary on Deveraux Ranch<br> to proceed without orders?<br> It isn't customary but...<br> - Yes, Mr. Deveraux?<br> I didn't have to say anything to him.<br> I see.<br> Suppose I didn't believe that.<br> Suppose I say that you<br> deliberately caused the trouble...<br> ...to bully and force McAndrews<br> in a opened fight.<br> Suppose I say to the jury you're<br> lying, aren't you?<br> Then I would tell you to get<br> a gun or leave town...<br> ...because when I leave here I'll<br> chase you until your heels smoke!<br> Got get'em<br> - Thatta boy, Matt.<br> Order! Order!<br> Mr. Deveraux, I hold you in contempt.<br> This court will be in<br> recess for an hour.<br> One more disturbance...<br> ...and the rest of the proceeding<br> will be made to closed door.<br> Matt, come on.<br> That did it. He hasn't got a chance.<br> What're we going to do?<br> What can we do?<br> Lawton said they'd to prove<br> him solely responsible.<br> He was, wasn't he?<br> - We were all with him.<br> I never asked to go.<br> - Me neither.<br> They'll put him in jail.<br> Look, Joe...<br> ...l'd do anything to help him...<br> - So would l, Joe...<br> ...but we can't just say...<br> - They'd arrest us for perjury.<br> That's right.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm going to get a smoke.<br> Me, too.<br> We got to do something, Ben.<br> Why?<br> They'll put him in jail.<br> - No.<br> Not him.<br> We got to do something,<br> we owe it to him.<br> Maybe you do, Joe, but not me.<br> You heard him up there...<br> You heard him telling<br> about his cattle...<br> ...and his wife, and going<br> it alone with three kids.<br> What do you think we did while<br> he was building up the state?<br> I worked 16 hours a day for him<br> when I was ten years old.<br> And all he ever did was<br> treat me like a hired hand.<br> Ben, listen...<br> - You don't know about that.<br> You came along later<br> when things were good.<br> So you figure you owe him something.<br> All right, go ahead,<br> do anything you like.<br> You're his little pet...<br> ...you always were.<br> It looks bad, doesn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm sorry about the judge.<br> - Yeah, he's tough.<br> I mean about Dad.<br> What about him?<br> Why, about him having<br> the fight with your father...<br> ...and refused to appoint the judge.<br> - He fought with Pa? What about?<br> Us.<br> Well, was it?<br> I thought he must have told you.<br> Where are you going?<br> - I've got to see Lawton!<br> Well?<br> It's all right. I made<br> a deal with them.<br> You'll have to give up<br> the land the mine is on.<br> Give up the land!<br> - Then you'll got to jail.<br> Look.<br> - Will you listen to me!<br> All right.<br> You give'em the title<br> to the mine...<br> ...and pay the injured men and the<br> costs on the wrecked building.<br> We can work that out later.<br> That wrecked building is worth...<br> - There's one more thing.<br> I'm going to put Joe on the stand.<br> Why?<br> - Somebody...<br> ...must be responsible...<br> Not Joe!<br> - Wait a minute!<br> I just talked to him.<br> He wants to do it.<br> He says McAndrews<br> called him a half-breed.<br> He says...<br> - Joe is not going on the stand!<br> Look, Matt...<br> This is a deal.<br> Somebody has to do this.<br> You just destroyed any<br> chance you had.<br> If they convict Joe,<br> we can appeal it.<br> If you give up the land,<br> they won't contest the appeal.<br> The worst that can happen is that<br> Joe will be held for a few weeks.<br> I don't like this.<br> - I don't ask you that!<br> I'm just asking you to<br> take some advice!<br> The court is now in session.<br> Please come to order.<br> I'm going to call<br> the boy to the stand.<br> If you say one word<br> until after the appeal...<br> ...it'll mean at least ten<br> years behind bars.<br> Call Joseph Deveraux.<br> Defense calls Joseph Deveraux.<br> Take the stand, please.<br> Do you swear...<br> ...to tell truth...<br> ...the whole truth...<br> ...and nothing but the truth?<br> We can't do anything more, Pa.<br> - Get away from me!<br> I don't want to talk to any of you!<br> Get away from me!<br> You are making yourself<br> ill, my husband.<br> Please! This will pass!<br> Two Moons said Lawton<br> brought some papers.<br> They're here, I will get'em.<br> And food.<br> - No food, just the papers.<br> But you must eat.<br> - I sent Two Moons to look for 'em.<br> They're still your sons.<br> Please send them to me<br> when the come, 'Seora'.<br> You wanted us?<br> No, I don't want you.<br> I told you to come here. Sit down.<br> All right.<br> What is it, Pa?<br> Papers.<br> Lawton wrote'em.<br> It's an agreement to keep<br> Joe out of jail.<br> You own the property, so you sign<br> them. Here you, make your mark.<br> I can write.<br> How much, Pa?<br> 80,000 cash and the mine property.<br> Sign it!<br> No.<br> Is too much, Pa, get<br> them to cut it down.<br> Why you...?<br> This is to keep Joe<br> out of jail. Sign it!<br> No!<br> We are not gonna sign it, Pa.<br> You'll sign these papers<br> or I'll kill skin the lot of you!<br> We decided we're not gonna<br> sign, it's too much money.<br> Joe'll only get 7 or 6 month.<br> - Sign it!<br> Take it easy, Pa.<br> It won't do you any good to<br> get yourself wound up...<br> Get him to bed.<br> I'll send for the doctor.<br> You, Deveraux!<br> Come on down.<br> You got a visitor...<br> ...a pretty one.<br> No.<br> - Joe, don't give me no trouble.<br> Joe!<br> Yeah, it's me.<br> Get out!<br> Orders are to stay with prisoner.<br> - Get out, now!<br> Joe, what's the matter?<br> What are they doing to you?<br> - Nothing!<br> Nobody's doing anything to me.<br> I was working and it's hot.<br> I don't understand, Joe.<br> - I'm a convict.<br> I work and eat here and sleeps<br> in these stinking clothes.<br> My darling...<br> ...as if that could...<br> You shouldn't have come here.<br> Don't do it again.<br> Shouldn't have come?<br> Why not?<br> Three years isn't forever, Joe.<br> No matter how hard it is, I can...<br> - It isn't hard.<br> It's just being here, and<br> not being able to get out.<br> Is it your father?<br> He's been sick but he's been...<br> - I know about it.<br> Two Moons has been here. I know<br> what they're doing to the old man.<br> They killing him, just little by<br> little, day by day...<br> ...they're tearing him apart.<br> While I'm in this...<br> - Joe, stop it!<br> Stop thinking about your father and<br> your brothers and the crazy ranch.<br> Forget it, you've got your own life.<br> - Forget it?<br> That's what keeps me going.<br> - But...<br> ...it's insane to brood for 3 years.<br> Joe...<br> ...please...<br> ...when you get out, we'll go away.<br> Just the two of us, any place...<br> - Stop it!<br> You're going to be on the outside,<br> with people, free to move around.<br> I can wait.<br> Maybe you can.<br> I'm not so sure about me.<br> When I see you...<br> Now do you understand?<br> Don't come here again.<br> Stay here.<br> He's coming.<br> I know he's coming, but<br> when? I want him now.<br> He's here.<br> Please, my husband...<br> ...no more quarrels.<br> Try to understand him a little.<br> Hello, Ma.<br> Pa.<br> Leave us alone, will you 'Seora'?<br> Sit down, Ben.<br> This is all right.<br> What's on your mind, Pa?<br> The land.<br> They tell me you're selling<br> some to an oil company.<br> That's right.<br> Why?<br> We need the money to operate with.<br> To operate that office in town?<br> Yeah.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> You wouldn't like it...<br> ...and the Doc says it's<br> bad for you get riled up.<br> Yeah.<br> You're real concerned about<br> my health, aren't you?<br> I don't like it. I don't<br> like selling the land.<br> It's good business for the ranch.<br> I'm selling it, Pa.<br> It's yours to sell.<br> I spent my life building it for<br> you and the others, but...<br> I've been rough on you, Ben,<br> because you were...<br> ...the oldest.<br> I guess I felt I could<br> expect more from you.<br> I never did this before,<br> but I'm doing it now.<br> I'm asking you, Ben.<br> Give up this sale, will you?<br> No.<br> It figured.<br> I always knew there was something<br> between us, some way.<br> What is it, Ben? What is it?<br> Joe, maybe, Ben? Joe?<br> Because he's smarter<br> than the rest of you?<br> Because he stood up to me when<br> the rest of you were afraid to?<br> You hate Joe, don't you, Ben?<br> No, I never hated Joe.<br> Me, then.<br> I'm no trouble to you now.<br> - No, not now...<br> ...because you're old<br> and crippled and sick.<br> So now you call me in and ask me<br> something. You're a little late.<br> Did you ask me how I'd like and<br> Indian stepmother after Ma died?<br> Or how I liked doing all the chores<br> and caring for Mike and Denny?<br> Or how I liked quitting<br> school to work for you?<br> Did you ever in your life...<br> ...ask me how I felt or what<br> I thought? What I wanted?<br> No, you didn't.<br> So, it's...<br> ...it's a little late<br> for asking now, Pa.<br> But the gate is always open, Ben...<br> ...you could have left. I would<br> have understood that...<br> ...I did it myself.<br> I always used to think there was...<br> ...too much of me in you<br> for us to hit it off.<br> But I know now that was wrong.<br> There wasn't enough of me in you.<br> Now I'm telling you again.<br> I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.<br> You're not going to sell any<br> of the Deveraux Ranch.<br> Because I'll stop you, Ben.<br> I'll stop you!<br> - Sit down, Pa.<br> You're not telling anybody<br> anything anymore.<br> I run Deveraux Ranch<br> and I run it the way I like.<br> And right now I'm riding<br> into town to sign a deal.<br> 'Seora'!<br> Two Moons!<br> Two Moons, get my horse.<br> 'Seor' Matt, to ride<br> the horse is death.<br> He's right. It will kill<br> you, my husband.<br> What difference does it make?<br> If you die...<br> ...I die.<br> 'Seora'...<br> ...this must be done.<br> You understand?<br> Ben!<br> Ain't that Pa?<br> Yeah.<br> He's trying to head<br> us off. Come on!<br> He's got us, Ben!<br> - Hold it still!<br> Mike!<br> Is he dead, Ben?<br> I wonder how long?<br> Go on back to the ranch<br> and get a buckboard.<br> Do you wan't that we stay here?<br> - No, go on back.<br> Both of you.<br> I'm sorry it had to be this way, Joe.<br> No!<br> No more of this!<br> You are brothers.<br> Joseph.<br> Ma!<br> Ma!<br> - My son! My son!<br> You've changed.<br> Not much.<br> What about you? These clothes...<br> When your father died...<br> ...I went back to my people.<br> To die, too, I think.<br> But I knew I must see you.<br> What do you do with the gun?<br> It's his.<br> It's all he had when he started.<br> I'm starting too.<br> That's not a start.<br> It is the end.<br> To take that is blood.<br> - They killed him.<br> Ben did.<br> Slow death!<br> You saw it happen.<br> You know what they did.<br> You're speaking like<br> a boy, my son...<br> ...and you should already be a man.<br> - You don't understand.<br> Listen to me.<br> He was my husband for 25 years.<br> I loved him more than<br> anything in the world.<br> Perhaps even more than you, Joseph.<br> I know, Ma.<br> You think to take up<br> his gun and his life.<br> You cannot, Joseph.<br> It is finished with him.<br> You must make your own life.<br> Go away.<br> Take the girl with you.<br> Barbara?<br> She has come to me may times.<br> For her, too...<br> ...there can only be one.<br> Take her away, Joseph.<br> And when you're together...<br> ...you'll now there's not<br> need for blood...<br> ...nor for him...<br> ...nor for that.<br> Give it to me.<br> What about you, Ma?<br> There is no longer need<br> for me, my son.<br> Keep riding, Joe.<br> Get going.<br> There's no need for this, I made<br> up my mind. I'm pulling out.<br> You missed your train.<br> - I' don't need any.<br> I said I'm leaving.<br> - I believe you.<br> But for how long?<br> What do you mean?<br> - Just that.<br> I could never be sure when<br> you might get an idea.<br> There's always that lance<br> you threw at my feet that day...<br> That was an old Comanche sign.<br> - Sure, I know that.<br> You see, I'm mighty superstitious.<br> I got to thinking about it.<br> I figured I might not sleep good<br> nights, worrying about you.<br> I slept awful good these past years.<br> - You're crazy, Ben, you...<br> Take it easy, Joe.<br> Just swing off there...<br> ...we'll get up into the hills.<br> Move!<br> You won't get away with it.<br> You could cut your own throat.<br> May be.<br> No sense you worrying<br> about it though.<br> What about Denny and Mike?<br> You can't keep'em quiet.<br> I sent them into town.<br> I know better than to let them<br> in on anything like this.<br> I could have saved you<br> the trouble, Joe.<br> It's lovely and peaceful here.<br> Doesn't seem to go with Pa,<br> somehow, but you can't tell.<br> Do you think he'd like these?<br> I know he would.<br>
