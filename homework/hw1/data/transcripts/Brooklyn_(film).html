                        1<br> Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?<br> Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me<br> in some way or another.<br> Nine o'clock mass is over, girls.<br> - Now. One moment, please. - Thank you.<br> Mrs. Brady, what would you like this morning?<br> Half a dozen rashers, please.<br> Of course. Eilis will get that for you now.<br> -I was next. - And you still are.<br> - Yes? - I need some shoe polish.<br> Shoe polish?<br> That's not really a Sunday item now, is it?<br> These people need things for their dinner or their tea.<br> Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?<br> Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Miss. Kelly....<br> I haven't forgotten. Spit it out, whatever it is.<br> I'm away to America.<br> Whose idea was that?<br> Father Flood in New York arranged it.<br> Rose used to play golf with him. He sponsored me.<br> He found me a job and got me a visa.<br> Well, we won't be needing you back here.<br> I could work every Sunday until I go.<br> No, thank you.<br> - Your poor sister. - My sister?<br> Oh, mothers are always being left behind in this country.<br> But Rose ... That's the end for her now, isn't it?<br> She will be looking after your mother, for the rest of her life.<br> I wish I had written to Father Flood about you, Rose.<br> Me? I have a job.<br> You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.<br> You should not call her that.<br> I think it's quite a kind name,<br> considering she's actually a terrible old witch.<br> Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.<br> Good.<br> They say it's hotter there in the summer, and colder in the winter.<br> What in Heaven's name will she do about clothes?<br> She'll buy them, mother.<br> She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.<br> She won't have much choice. She'll be there for...<br> - You look beautiful, Nancy. - Thank you.<br> You look so beautiful it makes me despair of this place.<br> Why?<br> Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.<br> You should be able to choose any man you want.<br> And we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.<br> - Do you think he might? - Of course he will.<br> I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?<br> Gary Cooper <br> <br> And those boys with their hair-oil and their blazers<br> He has beautiful eyes.<br> Hmm. And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the Market Square.<br> Why didn't you wear your blue dress?<br> Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?<br> I suppose because I'm going away.<br> Come on.<br> He's looked over here twice already.<br> He hasn't!<br> He's walking over here now.<br> He's not!<br> <br> Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridans doing?<br> Would you like to dance?<br> Is that really everything you own?<br> Oh, Eilis. I should have looked after you better.<br> You've bought most of these clothes in this case.<br> That's one of the reasons I'm going,<br> because I can't buy my own.<br> If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you, gladly.<br> But I can't buy you a future.<br> I can't buy you the kind of life you need.<br> I know.<br> - But you'll come see me there one day? -Yes.<br> And you'll look after yourself?<br> You don't have to worry about me.<br> And I'll come home to visit, won't I?<br> Because I couldn't bear it if...<br> You haven't packed your shoes yet.<br> They'll take up a bit of room.<br> There.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Off!<br> Number one. Bottom bunk.<br> That's mine. You're on the top.<br> This is hell. Never again.<br> Never again to America?<br> The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.<br> I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.<br> - Let's go for a smoke. - I don't.<br> Suit yourself. I'll see you later.<br> Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.<br> It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.<br> It's supposed to be a rough one tonight,<br> so none of the other passengers are eating.<br> A few spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not the mutton stew.<br> Please unlock it.<br> Go away, it is closed.<br> I'm sorry about the smell, and the bucket.<br> Don't worry. The whole boat stinks.<br> Even First Class.<br> I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.<br> The bathroom door was locked all night.<br> Oh, those bastards.<br> There. It won't be very comfortable. But at least it's ours.<br> Open the door.<br> Fuck off! Do you hear me? Fuck off!<br> If you had been nice last night, we would have played fair.<br> Now you've got no toilet, you bastards.<br> Go on, you can use it. I'm gonna get us some water.<br> That's all you're allowed.<br> You going to live in America?<br> You have papers and everything?<br> Yes. And a job.<br> How did you manage to arrange all that?<br> I didn't. Someone did it for me. A priest my sister knows.<br> And how do you feel about it?<br> How long do the letters from Ireland take to arrive?<br> My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.<br> They take a long time at first, and then no time at all.<br> You have family in America? Friends?<br> No.<br> You'll meet people easy enough.<br> Where are you gonna live?<br> Brooklyn?<br> How do you know that?<br> Lucky guess.<br> Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.<br> That's what it's like?<br> That's what it's like.<br> - I've been sick for hours. -Nice, isn't it?<br> I am very hungry.<br> Hmm, that's why you haven't been sick for hours.<br> We'll eat tomorrow.<br> Or the day after.<br> Oh, dear. We'll have to do something with you.<br> They'll put you in quarantine or something<br> if you try to enter the country looking like that.<br> Nothing fancy. You mustn't look like a tart.<br> Oh, Well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.<br> This doesn't look too bad.<br> My sister gave me that.<br> <br> Wear it with this<br> and this.<br> Open your bags ready for inspection.<br> Don't look too innocent, though.<br> I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.<br> Perhaps some eye-liner.<br> You step out of the line please. Thank you. Next, please. Thank you.<br> Passport please.<br> Stand up straight.<br> Polish your shoes, and don't cough whatever you do.<br> Don't be rude, or pushy, and don't look too nervous.<br> This way!<br> Think like an American.<br> You have to know where you're going.<br> Welcome to the United States, Ma'am. Through the blue door, please.<br> Next, please.<br> Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive<br> from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.<br> Amen.<br> I saw you had a letter today, Diana. Any news?<br> Mr. de Valera has had another operation on his eyes, she says.<br> I don't want news that I can read in a newspaper.<br> Anyway, we would describe Mr. de Valera as "politics",<br> would we not, Mrs. Kehoe?<br> And we do not like politics at the dinner table.<br> We don't.<br> It's not politics to talk about eye operations.<br> It is if the eyes belong to a politician.<br> And I do not like to talk about hospitals very much, either.<br> Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?<br> I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.<br> And I showed her the advertisement.<br> I don't want to have to travel all the way<br> to Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.<br> Maybe you could have a look at Bartocci's for me, Eilis?<br> Yes, Mrs. Kehoe.<br> Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.<br> She does not know for sure, Mrs. Kehoe.<br> She is only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's<br> to get at Patty.<br> They are both very good,<br> and you girls are very lucky to be working there.<br> Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin, is that right?<br> What do you do about that?<br> Just... Well, I wash it, Mrs. Kehoe, with soap.<br> There is nothing wrong with soap.<br> Soap was good enough for our Lord. I expect.<br> Well, which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?<br> Does the Bible tell you that?<br> Our Lord was a man, anyway.<br> He didn't care about greasy skin.<br> Ladies. No more talk about our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.<br> The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis, won't you, the girls?<br> <br> - Hi. - Good Morning.<br> Did you go out last night?<br> - Out. The opposite of in . - No.<br> Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.<br> "What did you see, Dorothy?"<br> "I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis. They filmed it in Ireland."<br> "Oh, I'm from Ireland".<br> "I know you are, that's why I thought you might be interested."<br> Thank you.<br> Shouldn't be a moment.<br> Is it still hot out there?<br> I haven't been outside since this morning<br> but I can tell that it might be.<br> Very. It just..looks it.<br> It's warm, yes.<br> Thanks very much.<br> Remember ... If people like it here, they will come back.<br> So you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.<br> I will try.<br> It's not a matter of trying. It's what you have to do.<br> Do you try to wear panties every day?<br> No.<br> I mean, I don't..I don't try. I just put them on.<br> You see what I'm saying?<br> - Yes. - Good.<br> Can I get another sliced toast please?<br> Slice up some hot dog.<br> They want them sliced down the middle!<br> Sorry. Could I have the bill please?<br> I hope that when I go through the pearly gates,<br> the first sound I hear is you<br> asking me for the check in that lovely Irish brogue.<br> Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?<br> We've never had a Bartocci's girl living here.<br> We might get some inside information.<br> I haven't been told anything.<br> I'll bet you wouldn't let on if you had.<br> She's that sort. More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.<br> Like a Red spy.<br> Oh, dear God.<br> I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.<br> He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.<br> Sorry Mrs. Kehoe.<br> I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.<br> - Did I? - Em.<br> I forgot to check.<br> They'll still be there after dinner.<br> Oh sorry.<br> Dear Eilis,<br> It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America.<br> Thousands of miles across the sea.<br> The big news here is that since you left,<br> Mummy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.<br> As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh.<br> And she overcharge for everything.<br> And she's awful.<br> I haven't told her to her face.There's no need.<br> She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.<br> We talk about you every evening, of course.<br> We want to know everything.<br> I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were two hundred pages,<br> they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.<br> Take care of yourself. Love.<br> Is it your time of the month?<br> So what is it?<br> Take some time off now. Go and sit in the staff room.<br> I'm so sorry, Eilis. This is all my fault.<br> I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.<br> Franco Bartocci says you are doing great here.<br> Ma Kehoe says you are the nicest lodger she's ever had.<br> - What? - Ma Kehoe?<br> Don't ever call her that to her face.<br> I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.<br> I've enrolled you in a night class.<br> For book-keeping. The Brooklyn College.<br> It will be three nights a week.<br> And I've paid your tuition for the first semester.<br> - - <br> - Why? - Why?<br> Not "Thank you"?<br> Sorry, thank you. But why?<br> I was amazed that someone as clever as you<br> couldn't find proper work at home.<br> I've been here too long.<br> I forget what it's like in Ireland.<br> So when your sister wrote to me about you<br> I said that the Church would try to help.<br> Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.<br> I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.<br> All I can say is that it will pass.<br> Homesickness is like most sicknesses.<br> It will make you feel wretched, and then it will move on to somebody else.<br> Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co<br> is one of the most important corporate cases<br> decided in the Supreme Court in the last twenty years.<br> This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock doctrine,<br> so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.<br> In public utility integration proceedings alone<br> literally thousands of investors<br> may be affected by its application.<br> Did you understand any of that?<br> I mean, a single word?<br> He's not even reading from a book.<br> He just knows all this.<br> Well, Let's hope the next hour is easier.<br> One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.<br> It all tastes of sawdust.<br> So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam,<br> and extra turkey for everyone else.<br> Ladies, please.<br> Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.<br> Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?<br> He asks us every year. We always say no.<br> Ellis, you're a saint. They smell awful.<br> Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband-hunting.<br> It's a marvelous thing you're doing, Eilis. A Christian thing.<br> I wish there were more like you.<br> You can come.<br> How many are we expecting?<br> There were a hundred last year. There may be more this.<br> - They all Irish? - All Irish.<br> Why don't they go home?<br> If there's nothing there for a clever young girl such as yourself,<br> there's gonna be even less for men like these.<br> Some of them have been here fifty years,<br> they have lost touch with everyone.<br> Happy Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas. - Thank you.<br> These are the men who built ...<br> the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.<br> God alone knows what they live on now.<br> I don't want to interrupt the proceedings,<br> but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation<br> to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.<br> And by way of a thank you,<br> we have a great singer in the room with us today.<br> Frankie.<br> Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?<br> You've earned it.<br> - You survived! - Oh it wasn't so bad.<br> - Happy Christmas! - Cheers.<br> Now Miss McAdam is leaving us.<br> She is going to live with her sister in Manhattan.<br> She has the best room in the house.<br> The basement. And it has its own entrance.<br> Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.<br> Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.<br> Although I will admit that God did give Miss McAdam an advantage,<br> when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.<br> No no, you're a pretty girl Eilis. But you're sensible.<br> So, you're having the room and that's that.<br> Would the other girls not mind?<br> Oh, I expect so. What don't they mind?<br> Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?<br> There's a dance?<br> At the parish hall.<br> There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.<br> Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.<br> We're going to see a movie instead.<br> Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.<br> I would, very much.<br> There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.<br> Yes, surprising, isn't it? You'd think it would be the other way around.<br> Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.<br> So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.<br> So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?<br> Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.<br> - Will you be going, Eilis? - Yes, Mrs Kehoe.<br> Well, you can take Dolores, then.<br> Of course.<br> God, there's nobody here.<br> How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?<br> I expect most people will come after nine.<br> People? Or fellas?<br> Some of the people will be fellas.<br> I'd love to meet a fella.<br> They came! The liars!<br> What a pair of bitches.<br> That's what the old woman called them. She said they were all bitches,<br> apart from you.<br> Well hello.<br> Hello. It's good to see you.<br> I can see why.<br> Come with us.<br> There. That's better.<br> Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.<br> Is that what I looked like?<br> Just a bit. Nice clean cows.<br> 1, 2, 3 ...<br> Not bad.<br> Maybe we could have a dance later?<br> - Sorry? - A dance later.<br> Oh sure.<br> Would you like to dance?<br> Are you here with that guy? The one who was teaching you to dance?<br> No.<br> So would you dance with me?<br> I'm not sure he taught me anything.<br> Doesn't matter. The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.<br> Ah. I wish someone had told me that years ago.<br> Come on.<br> - Where do you live? - Clinton Street.<br> Yeah? That's on my way home.<br> Can I walk you?<br> I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.<br> So I don't get the wrong idea?<br> I suppose so.<br> Is there a girl in a white shirt<br> sitting on her own over there?<br> You don't know her?<br> I do.<br> She lives in my boarding house, and she's awful.<br> If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.<br> You'd be rescuing me.<br> I get it.<br> - I'm not Irish. - You don't sound Irish.<br> I need to make this clear. No part of me is Irish.<br> I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.<br> I'm an Italian. Well, my my parents are, anyway.<br> So what were you doing at an Irish dance?<br> Don't the Italians have dances?<br> Yeah. And I wouldn't want to take you to one.<br> They behave like Italians all night.<br> What does that mean?<br> - Oh, you know. - No.<br> - Hands. - Too many of them?<br> Oh,my. I guess it could seem that way, if it was a girl.<br> Listen<br> I want everything out in the open.<br> I came to the Irish dance because I really like Irish girls.<br> And I was the only one who would dance with you?<br> Oh, no, it wasn't...<br> Oh, so you danced with loads of others?<br> This is me.<br> Can I take you next week? Maybe get something to eat first?<br> That'd be nice.<br> Good night.<br> There you go.<br> So...What do you do when you're not working?<br> Well. There's school. Just, you know...Brooklyn College.<br> I'm studying book-keeping.<br> You want to be a book-keeper?<br> Well, I want to be an accountant one day. But, yes, book-keeping first.<br> Wow. Is that difficult?<br> I'm talking too much. Tell me about plumbing.<br> - You know enough about plumbing already. - I don't know anything.<br> You know that taps drip and toilets get blocked<br> and that's all you need to know.<br> I don't know anything about book-keeping.<br> Well.There's a lot to it.<br> There's all the maths, of course,<br> but that's not so complicated.<br> The double entry system, that takes a while to get used to.<br> And we study company law, too, and that terrifies me.<br> So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s,<br> and all the the legal issues that went along with that...<br> She plays golf, and she's really good at it.<br> And if she'd been at the dance last Saturday,then...<br> I don't think you'd have looked at me twice, because Rose is beautiful.<br> I'm worried you haven't eaten anything.<br> Too busy talking.<br> What is the matter with you girls now?<br> Nothing is matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.<br> Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?<br> Eilis' young man?<br> We didn't know. She won't say anything about it.<br> And why should she, to you awful gossip-mongers?<br> Anyway, I met him on Saturday night ...<br> when he called for Eilis, and he is a gentleman.<br> Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?<br> We know he's quite nice-looking.<br> I didn't like his shoes much.<br> What on earth is wrong with the shoes?<br> They were a funny color.<br> I'll tell you this much:<br> I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.<br> I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.<br> A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man,<br> and the noise she makes is a lot worse. Now, enough.<br> Yeah. Think about it. You can...<br> Yeah,yeah.<br> All I want to do is travel home with you.<br> No food, no drink, no nothing.<br> I know you got to study and get some sleep.<br> I'll take you to your house and say goodnight.<br> Otherwise, it's too long to wait.<br> I want to ask you something. And you're gonna say, "oh, it's too soon."<br> "I don't really know him well enough, we've only been out a couple times."<br> Oh, it's nothing so bad. It is just something that most guys...<br> Please just ask. You're beginning to terrify me.<br> Oh. Sure. Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?<br> That's it?<br> I'd love to.<br> You like italian food?<br> Don't know. I've never eaten it.<br> It is the best food in the world.<br> Well, why would not I like it?<br> You're in a good mood, huh?<br> Yes, why?<br> It's just... I like how you're being, I don't know the word.<br> When you go along with everything.<br> Amenable?<br> Yeah. Amenable. OK,<br> so while you're being amenable..<br> Can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night classes?<br> I'll sign up for two movies.<br> - Really? - Yes.<br> Even if the first date is a disaster,<br> I'll give it another chance.<br> It certainly feels like it,<br> but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.<br> Well congratulations. You survived your first New York winter.<br> Ah, it wasn't so bad.<br> Really? It's colder in Ireland?<br> Oh no, it's colder here.<br> Over here, that's how we judge the winter. On how cold it is.<br> But you have heating. Heating everywhere. You're only cold outside.<br> I guess that's true.<br> - Thank you for your help. - Have a good day.<br> Eilis! You're like a different person!<br> How did you do it?<br> Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.<br> I met somebody. An Italian fella.<br> Oh no. I'm not passing that on.<br> I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.<br> Does he talk about baseball all the time? Or his mother?<br> No.<br> Then keep him. There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.<br> Hold it. Now remember You're getting off easy, because we haven't got sauce.<br> Yeah. You have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.<br> I'm gonna say "Splash" anytime I see problems.<br> - Good idea. - Can I start now?<br> - Yeah! - Go!<br> SPLASH!<br> You just splashed his mother, and his father, and the walls...<br> Let's go again.<br> Dear Rose, I suppose the most important news<br> is that I have a boyfriend<br> He isn't as important as Bartocci's ...<br> and my evening classes, I know that.<br> But I wanted to tell you everything that is going on.<br> Please don't mention it to Mummy though. You know what's she like.<br> He's decent and kind, and he has a job, and he works hard.<br> We go to the cinema on Wednesdays<br> and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.<br> I think of you and mother every single day.<br> But Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here.<br> I didn't have before I met him.<br> My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.<br> Now it's halfway across the sea.<br> So that's something, isn't it?<br> <br> Oh and Id better warned you about Frankie.<br> He's the little one.<br> Yeah. He's eight going on eighteen.<br> He's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking<br> and he's talking about all the things he's gonna to say to you.<br> - What sorts of things? - We don't know. Could be anything.<br> I mean, I swear I tried to pay him money to<br> go out and play ball with his friends.<br> And my dad, he threatened him,<br> but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble<br> so much so he'll happily take a beating.<br> This is us here.<br> Ready?<br> Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?<br> I've been taking lessons.<br> Lessons? Like, in a class? You can do that?<br> Maybe I could teach you.<br> No, no. Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me...<br> cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.<br> So, what do you eat in Ireland? Just Irish stew?<br> Not just. We...<br> So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.<br> Hey, hey ...<br> - Frankie! - What?<br> We don't! That is a well known fact!<br> Why Frankie?<br> Because a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up<br> and he had to get stitches.<br> And because all the cops round here are Irish,<br> nobody did anything about it.<br> There are probably two sides to it.<br> I might have said something I shouldn't, you know, I can't remember now.<br> No, because they beat you up.<br> Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.<br> No. They just had red hair and big legs.<br> Raise up! Excuse us.<br> All I can say in his defence is that he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.<br> If he can keep his mouth shut.<br> So, Tony tells me go to college.<br> Oh, just night classes. I want to be a book-keeper.<br> I like working in the shop well enough,<br> but I don't want to be there forever.<br> Good.<br> I'm sorry, Eilis. I'm an idiot.I'm a rude idiot.<br> So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbett's Field when the season starts?<br> You like baseball?<br> He never mentioned the Dodgers? Not even once?<br> Tony, what is the matter with you?<br> You know why? Too much of this.<br> Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbett's Field if you want to see him in the summer.<br> They're that important to you?<br> Put it this way.<br> If our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants, it would break my heart.<br> Mine too.<br> She's not laughing, Tony. I think it's too late.<br> She's a Yanks fan.<br> What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?<br> He's a Yanks fan.<br> I love you.<br> I..Thank you for the evening. It was lovely.<br> Sorry!<br> I'd finished.<br> Sheila can I ask you something?<br> Why are not you married?<br> Because my husband met somebody else and left me.<br> Oh I'm sorry.<br> And ... Well, would you get married again?<br> - Has somebody asked you? - No, not really.<br> I won't ask what that means.<br> Sheila?<br> Would I get married again?<br> No. I want to be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding-house, forever.<br> Of course, I do.<br> That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.<br> I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom.<br> While some bad-tempered fella,<br> with hair growing out of his ears<br> reads the newspaper on the toilet.<br> And then I'll wish I was back here, talking to you.<br> I'll catch you tomorrow right?<br> Eilis! I'm sorry!<br> I did not think you were coming.<br> I know. I thought you were gonna think that.<br> That's why I wanted to be here. No matter what.<br> I need to say something...<br> Can you... Can we talk about something else ...<br> until we get to Ms. Kehoe?<br> - It's Not ... - Please?<br> So. Ten minutes before I'm supposed meet you ...<br> and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.<br> Yes. Even if you were thinking of inviting me in for a coffee.<br> I would have to say no, for your sake.<br> So how did you fix it in ten minutes?<br> I didn't. I spent the whole ten minutes explaining to the old lady<br> that I had to be somewhere and I'd be back.<br> She didn't want to let me go.<br> So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?<br> Oh, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?<br> Let me say what I want to say. I don't think you'll mind.<br> Okay.<br> You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me.<br> Well, I didn't really know what to say.<br> But I know what to say now.<br> I have thought about you. And I like you,<br> and I like being with you and ...<br> Maybe, I feel the same way.<br> So the next time you tell me you love me,<br> if there is a next time ...<br> I'll say I love you too.<br> - Are you serious? - Yes.<br> Holy shit! Excuse my language, but...<br> I thought we were having a different kind of talk.<br> Can I go home now?<br> - You love Me? - Yes.<br> But don't ask me anything else,<br> and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.<br> Oh what? You want kids who like the Yankees?<br> Tony, please don't push me.<br> All right. I'm sorry.<br> Dear Eilis,<br> Thank you so much for the nylons.<br> The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.<br> It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.<br> I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.<br> Oh Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.<br> Well. You're marvelous, that's all I have to say.<br> And it looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.<br> You, you flew through them.<br> I can't remember the last time anyone came here with good news.<br> I've saved some money.<br> I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.<br> One of my parishioners paid.<br> He needed to do something for mankind, and I won't tell you why.<br> He is not out of the woods yet, either.<br> so he can cough up for next year, too.<br> I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.<br> Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.<br> Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.<br> You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.<br> Seems like years ago.<br> Now, I think this is the first time ...<br> any girl of mine<br> has ever passed an exam, while living here.<br> Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?<br> Of course.<br> And is he taking you out to celebrate?<br> We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.<br> - Oh, boy! - What does that mean?<br> Do you have a bathing costume?<br> - No, I was going to get one... - Do you have sunglasses?<br> - No. - You need sunglasses.<br> I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year<br> people will talk about you.<br> And what exactly will they say, Sheila?<br> That's the thing, Mrs. Kehoe.<br> You'd never know, because they'd never say it to your face.<br> Oh, dear God!<br> Diana's right, though, Eilis. You need to think carefully about your costume.<br> It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you. You don't want to put him off.<br> You'll have to shave down there.<br> I'll give you a razor that will do the trick.<br> You're all right there for the moment.<br> And most Italian men appreciate the fuller figure.<br> But watch yourself, over the summer.<br> The black's too dark for your pale skin.<br> Let's see you in the green.<br> Look at that thing.<br> Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?<br> I thought you'd know.<br> Right, I'm ready.<br> - Tony! - What?<br> Come on.<br> Dear Rose, Thanks for your letter.<br> I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.<br> You must have been really pleased.<br> I still miss you and mother,<br> and I think about you every day.<br> But I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America,<br> I'm really happy.<br> This is a lot to do with Tony.<br> At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers,<br> the baseball team he loves.<br> They lost, so he was annoyed.<br> But I've also started to look for office work, too.<br> I had an interview this week ...<br> at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.<br> Rose?<br> Who'd have thought that there would be two book-keepers in the family?<br> Rose?<br> I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and mummy.<br> Rose!<br> Rose? Oh my God!<br> Oh God!<br> Rose?<br> Oh no!<br> A moment.<br> It was sudden. I think perhaps she was ill,<br> and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.<br> What will happen?<br> What can happen?<br> - When will they bury her? - Tomorrow.<br> - Without me. - Without you.<br> You're too far away, Eilis.<br> Why did I ever come here?<br> Rose wanted a better life for you.<br> She loved how well you were doing.<br> But I will never see her again.<br> That's right, isn't it, Father? I will never see her again.<br> You know that I think you will.<br> And she will be watching over you, every day, for the rest of your life.<br> Hello? Mommy?<br> Can you hear me now? Hello?<br> I can't really hear you.<br> Well, the rain held off, anyway.<br> And the whole of her golf club came. Every single one of them.<br> We had a real houseful afterwards.<br> Are you still there?<br> Yes.<br> People really loved her, Eilis.<br> Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.<br> Nobody knew what to say to me.<br> When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much<br> because I had the two of you.<br> Then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing<br> because she was here with me.<br> But everyone's gone, Eilis. I have nobody.<br> I can't bear it, Tony.<br> You wanna go home, I guess.<br> And how would it be for you, if I did go home?<br> I'll be afraid, every single day.<br> - Afraid that I wouldn't come back? - Yes. Home is home.<br> I'm not sure if I have a home anymore.<br> You are not going to work tomorrow, are you?<br> After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?<br> This is it.<br> We're gonna build five houses here, if we can.<br> And mom and dad, they are gonna have one,<br> Cos ma always wanted a house with a backyard.<br> We'll sell three. And the other one...<br> My brothers they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.<br> So, I guess what I'm saying is<br> if you want to live out here on Long Island?<br> I mean I know it doesn't look like much right now,<br> but all the land around here has been sold,<br> so we wouldn't be on our own.<br> And there would be telephone cables, electricity and everything.<br> We're gonna set up a company,<br> a building company, the three of us.<br> And I'm gonna do the plumbing and Lawrence is gonna do the carpentry.<br> Don't go all quiet on me.<br> At least tell me you'll think about it.<br> I don't need to think about it.<br> It's just for a month or so. I know it would make her feel a little better.<br> Will you marry me before you leave?<br> You don't trust me to come back?<br> Marry me! Marry me!<br> We don't have to tell anyone.<br> We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.<br> Why do you want to do it?<br> Because if we don't, I am gonna go crazy.<br> Would a promise not be the same?<br> If you can promise, you can easily do this.<br> So this is it? This is where you live?<br> Yes, and if you make one tiny noise she'll evict me.<br> Oh, man! Oh, man!<br> Oh, there's no point in worrying now. Stay with me.<br> - Do you want to play? - Yes, sure.<br> Alright. Here we go, one bat coming up.<br> I'll take that, alright. You ready? Hands up.<br> Oh, right down to the third-base line.<br> Is he annoying you? Because he is annoying me.<br> No no no. I got a brother the exact same age? Hey, are you Irish?<br> Is it so obvious?<br> I'm just about to marry an Irish girl,<br> so I guess I notice it more.<br> There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.<br> Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.<br> Where is your girl from?<br> Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.<br> I think my wife has family there.<br> Hey, Eilis! Come here for a second.<br> Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.<br> Will we ever tell our children we did this?<br> Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.<br> I wonder what they'll think of it.<br> Nancy!<br> You look so glamorous!<br> I told you so.<br> - I'm so sorry about Rose. - Thank you. How are you?<br> No!<br> I knew. But I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.<br> - I am so glad you can come to the wedding. - Can l?<br> Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.<br> - When is it? - The 27th of August.<br> Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?<br> Annette wants to see you, too.<br> Oh, I don't mind.<br> I'll have to find you a key.<br> I don't want you getting me out of bed.<br> We all want to hear what life in New York is like.<br> I'll try and think of something to say.<br> I'm booked to go back to New York on twenty-first.<br> Oh, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.<br> I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.<br> But you'd like him. I know you would.<br> He's sweet. He's funny.<br> <br> And he has got these wonderful eyes that<br> <br> I wish everything were different<br> So, now. Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.<br> Do we really have to do this?<br> Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?<br> What if Mrs. O'Toole from Cush writes back<br> To thank you for your thank you?<br> Then I'll thank her.<br> And you'll be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?<br> It's not as if I have anything else to do.<br> Nor anybody else to talk to.<br> It might as well be Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> That would be Nancy and Annette.<br> Off you go.<br> Enjoy yourself.<br> Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.<br> It's a great pleasure to meet you.<br> We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.<br> There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.<br> Okay.<br> Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?<br> No. But Nancy told us that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you.<br> Because you have too much to say to each other.<br> So we're just looking for company.<br> Oh, well.<br> Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?<br> I don't particularly, George.<br> When I first went to America,<br> I missed everything about Enniscorthy, except one.<br> We are not all the same.<br> You all look the same. It's the blazer and the hair-oil.<br> Nancy, where is Annette? And why has he come?<br> He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.<br> Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?<br> What happened to her?<br> <br> He broke it off. He didnt think she was serious about him.<br> He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.<br> Nancy, I'm going back.<br> But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?<br> Come on George.<br> How is your mother?<br> Well, she's sad. And she's got much older very quickly.<br> It was a terrible thing.<br> We all went to the funeral mass. My mother and my father and myself.<br> I did not know that.<br> My mother played golf with her, you know. she is very fond of her.<br> It was the saddest thing that happened in the town that I can remember.<br> - Thank you. - Come on you two.<br> - What about the skyscrapers? - But that is Manhattan.<br> I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn. And if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.<br> All the skyscrapers are across the river.<br> - You don't make it sound very glamorous. - It's not, really.<br> <br> Not even What do you call it?<br> The department store where you work?<br> Oh, Bartocci's? Well, it sells lovely things,<br> but I can't afford many of them ...<br> and I don't like the works.<br> What would you like to do?<br> I want to do what Rose did.<br> I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.<br> You should call in at Davis's.<br> They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.<br> I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.<br> But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.<br> I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.<br> Oh, you just want her to stay.<br> I am only thinking of Eilis.<br> Did you hear that Eilis? He's only thinking of you.<br> That's it, that's it...<br> - Good night. - Good night.<br> - See you. - See you.<br> Bye.<br> - How's your evening? - It's very nice, thank you.<br> Was that Jim Farrell I saw on the car with them?<br> It was.<br> His parents are moving, you know. They're retiring to the country.<br> He'll be in that big house on his own.<br> Is that right?<br> It's a catch for "someone".<br> Goodnight Mommy.<br> - Hello Eilis. - Hello Ms. Brennan..<br> I like her style.<br> - Thank Goodness you're back! - What's the matter?<br> A lad from Davis's came round.<br> They have a problem in their accounts department<br> - And they need you up there straight away. - Is that all?<br> - I'll just put the shopping away. - No, no, leave it.<br> <br> Straight away, the young fella said.<br> It doesn't matter what he said, Mother. I'm not an employee.<br> I'd be doing them a favour.<br> Please let me do the shopping.<br> The problem is that it's our busy season,<br> so all the middle workers and drivers did overtime last week.<br> Well, they filled out the overtime slips<br> but there's been nobody to work it all out,<br> to add to the wage slips.<br> And some of the men have started to complain.<br> And I can't blame them.<br> As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.<br> Well. If you leave me for a couple of hours, I can work out a system<br> so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.<br> Hello, Eilis.<br> Maria has been telling me you have done the most marvellous job here.<br> Thank you.<br> We should have known you would, of course.<br> You're Rose's sister, after all.<br> I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping?<br> Is it in American book-keeping?<br> I got the certificate in America,<br> but the two systems are very similar.<br> Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.<br> so I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.<br> Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.<br> I'll be going back to the United States soon.<br> As I said. Lets you and I speak again before we make<br> any firm decisions one way or the other.<br> Yes, Mr. Brown. Of course. Thank you.<br> Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.<br> - I'd forgotten. - What?<br> <br> This<br> You have beaches in Brooklyn?<br> Yes, but they are just very crowded.<br> There will probably be quite a few walkers along here later.<br> Yes. It's still not the same.<br> I'm sure it's not.<br> We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.<br> We must seem very backward to you now.<br> Of course not. You seem calm, and civilised. And charming.<br> Come on!<br> <br> My mother wanted you to know that the golf club<br> is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.<br> A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the Club.<br> She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.<br> I hope you're pleased.<br> Yes, of course.<br> So, every year, someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?<br> Every year. As long as there's a golf club.<br> And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.<br> Yeah and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.<br> I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.<br> Thank you, I'd like that.<br> I wish it had been like this before I went.<br> - Before Rose died. - Like what?<br> ...<br> There was nothing here for me here before. And now I have a job, and<br> Here?<br> - - <br> - Is that an American trick? - Yes. Its a good one, isnt it?<br> It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?<br> I mean how long have they known about it?<br> A hundred years, probably.<br> I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.<br> And we still don't have them now.<br> Well, come on.<br> You want to go see the Dodgers on Saturday?<br> Sure.<br> Okay, will you do something for me?<br> What?<br> If you laugh, or you say anything about this to anybody in the family,<br> you don't get to see the Dodgers on Saturday.<br> Or any other day of the season.<br> Also, you get a beating.<br> Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.<br> I really need your help Frankie.<br> You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?<br> I'm trying to write to Eilis, and I want it to be, I don't know ...<br> You wrote before already. About five times.<br> Yeah, but they are no good Frankie and ...<br> And she's only written back once.<br> She's never read my writing before. I'm worried I'm putting her off me.<br> Listen, I'm eight years old, I don't know anything about kissing.<br> You don't need to know anything about kissing.<br> You need to know about spelling and...and...<br> - Grammar? - Yeah, Will you look?<br> Dear Eilis, I hope that you're doing well in Ireland.<br> I hope that your mother is feeling less sad.<br> It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.<br> This week it is like the whole world's basements are flooding.<br> I fixed three. I've been working hard. I've been saving money.<br> Everybody asks me about you all the time.<br> You missed out the "e" I think. It is "everybody."<br> Anyway, I think that is all my news.<br> Mom and dad and all my brothers they all say hello.<br> I think about you most minutes of most days.<br> Even when I go see the Dodgers.<br> I do not concentrate on the game.<br> With love, your Tony.<br> No hair oil.<br> And that's not a blazer, it's a sports jacket.<br> Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?<br> Are you trying to trick me?<br> I knew what you meant, when you said we're all the same.<br> It made me think that my life must seem very east to you.<br> I run my father's bar, going to live in my parents' house.<br> I know what that must look like from the outside<br> But it doesn't feel like that.<br> What does it feel like?<br> I've never been anywhere.<br> I have never even been to England.<br> But I'd like to see London, and Paris and Rome. New York.<br> It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.<br> And there are other things too ...<br> I'm so sorry. I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.<br> I am glad.<br> - Really? - Yes.<br> Will you finsh that wretched pipe and sit with us?<br> I can hear perfectly well from where I am.<br> We are not here to provide you with entertainment.<br> Oh, don't you worry. I found that out many years ago.<br> Just ignore him, Eilis. It's as well Jim takes after me, but him.<br> Speak up!<br> Are you looking forward to your move?<br> Ah, I will miss Enniscorthy. But it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.<br> My mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.<br> She thinks I'll destroy the place.<br> I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.<br> I'm sure he won't.<br> I mean...<br> - God, aren't we blessed with this weather. - It's lovely.<br> Dear Tony, thank you for your letters.<br> I want you to know that...<br> I don't know what I want you to know.<br> I don't want to be sitting right at the back.<br> I'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.<br> Oh, it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.<br> We'll find the second best seats in the house then.<br> Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs. Lacey?<br> Would you mind Jim? That would be grand.<br> - Such a gentleman, isn't he? - He is.<br> He came along at just the right time for us.<br> I invite you now Nancy, to declare before God and his church ...<br> your consent to become George's wife.<br> I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad,<br> in sickness and in health. I will love you<br> and honour you all the days of my life.<br> The rings.<br> Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them<br> may always be faithful to each other.<br> May they do your will and live in peace with you, and mutual love.<br> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.<br> Amen.<br> Your mother tells me things are working out for you very well in Enniscorthy, Eilis.<br> It was a lovely service.<br> And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...<br> Yes, I know.<br> Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.<br> <br> Oh, do you hear that? Jim and I! Jim and I!.<br> It won't be long now, by the sound of it,<br> and your mother will have a wonderful day out.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> Can we talk?<br> - What about? - The future.<br> I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.<br> I'd regret it for the rest of my life.<br> So, I don't want you to go.<br> I want you to stay here, with me.<br> And I know that means asking you another question,<br> But I don't want to bombard you.<br> So I'll save that one for later.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm grateful. And I'm flattered.<br> - That's all? - No.<br> No, of course not.<br> It is just...<br> I'd imagined a different life for myself.<br> I understand.<br> But your life here could be just as good.<br> Better,even, maybe.<br> Mary!<br> I was just coming to fetch you.<br> To fetch me? I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.<br> Oh, Please come Eilis. She told me not to come back without you.<br> You know what she's like.<br> You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.<br> There are no customers in there at the moment,<br> so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.<br> So. How have you been getting on?<br> Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.<br> I heard that you're working over at Davis's?<br> In the accounts department?<br> That's right.<br> And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.<br> Ah, well. You know what people are like. They love to talk.<br> Yes. Do you remember Mrs. Brady?<br> She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.<br> No? Well, you have a very busy life now.<br> What with one thing and another.<br> Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.<br> The world is a small place, isn't it?<br> She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.<br> And what did it say?<br> Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall,<br> and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.<br> I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.<br> He didn't bump into me.<br> Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.<br> Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?<br> He couldn't remember. Something Italian, he thought.<br> I'd forgotten.<br> You'd forgotten! What a thing for...<br> I'd forgotten what this town is like.<br> What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?<br> Keep me away from Jim?<br> Stop me from going back to America?<br> Perhaps you didn't even know.<br> My name is Eilis Fiorello.<br> - Thank you. - How I can help you?<br> Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.<br> I think people spend even more money after a wedding.<br> Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.<br> She was buying firelighters in Broom's.<br> Firelighters! In August!<br> But she'd seen Mrs. Stapleton in there,<br> and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her, so...<br> Eilis, what's the matter?<br> Has something happened with Jim?<br> Mommy, I'm sorry.<br> I'm so sorry. I'm married.<br> I got married in Brooklyn before I came home. I should have told you.<br> I should have told you as soon as I got back.<br> I want to be with him. I want to be with my husband.<br> Of course.<br> Is he nice?<br> Yes.<br> He'd have to be nice, if you married him.<br> So you are going back?<br> Yes. Tomorrow.<br> Are you on the early train?<br> I'm going to bed.<br> Mummy...It's not even eight o'clock. You don't have to..<br> I'm very tired.<br> And I'd like to say goodbye now, and only once.<br> Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.<br> I will.<br> Goodnight Eilis.<br> So are you away to live in America?<br> - No. - Just visiting?<br> No. I live there already.<br> Really? What's it like?<br> It's a big place.<br> I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York. Do you know it?<br> Yes.<br> People say that there's so many Irish people there.<br> It's like home.<br> Is that right?<br> Yes, it's just like home.<br> You're not to eat.<br> But I might be there years.<br> No, you can eat when you get there.<br> Don't eat on the boat.<br> It'll stop you getting so sick. Do you promise me?<br> I promise.<br> And in a moment, I want you to go straight down to your cabin<br> and lock the bathroom door on your side.<br> When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.<br> When you get to Immigration, keep your eyes wide open,<br> Look as if you know where you're going.<br> You have to think like an American.<br> Could you please step forward?<br> You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die,<br> and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.<br> But you will, and it won't kill you.<br> And one day the sun will come out<br> and you might not even note it straight away, it would be that faint.<br> And then you will catch yourself thinking about something or<br> or someone who has no connection with the past,<br> Someone who's only yours.<br> And you'll realise<br> that this is where your life is.<br>
