Floor please, madam?<br> - Penthouse.<br> If we make love,<br> it'll be the only time.<br> - What if you like it?<br> - I know I'll like it.<br> - I got off on the wrong floor.<br> - You'd better get back on.<br> - Don't stop...<br> - Is that hurting?<br> Meyer, I've got half an hour.<br> I've got ten minutes of sunlamp...<br> All right,<br> I'll do the sunlamp on the train.<br> Of course I'm alone.<br> She was an hour ago.<br> I've got to do it.<br> Call Charlie. He likes to take a nap<br> when there's going to be trouble.<br> Ben, it really affects my opinion<br> of your ability to administrate -<br> - when you get yourself involved in<br> this type of detaiI. Right, Charlie?<br> - Of course.<br> - See what I'm talking about?<br> - You just shook his head.<br> - What else was I gonna to do?<br> Count to 53.<br> - Good evening, Mr. Siegel.<br> - Hi, give that a brush for me.<br> - Weren't you going to California?<br> - I came to give you a present.<br> - Present?<br> - Yeah, open it.<br> - I don't get it.<br> - We hired you to do a job.<br> We pay you a nice salary,<br> we throw in a piece of the action -<br> - and you pay us back<br> by stealing from us.<br> Do you want the shirt off my back?<br> I'd be happy to give it you.<br> Here, from Sulka's.<br> They're the ones I wear.<br> If I'd taken longer, I'd have<br> bought some pants and some suits.<br> But I can give you some tips.<br> Let me see your shoes.<br> I don't want to be rude to you,<br> but they don't go with anything.<br> $3,900 we paid three guys to take<br> care of this. Why are we here?<br> You know his thinking process.<br> Ben has only one problem.<br> The same problem he had when<br> we were kids together on the street.<br> He doesn't respect money.<br> But that's for summer... and you<br> don't have to worry about summer.<br> If it was just business, I'd sell<br> insurance or import dresses.<br> The key to taking over Jack Dragna's<br> Southern California rackets -<br> - is to come in smooth. Approach<br> him like we want to be a partner.<br> The guy's been running the rackets<br> for 20 years with no competition.<br> - Except for Mickey Cohen.<br> - So we move in amiably.<br> - What about the bars and clubs?<br> - Fifty-fifty.<br> We move in,<br> but we don't ruin anything.<br> - Joey A. Knows Jack Dragna.<br> - Jack's a cold-blooded killer.<br> You've got to be careful.

Four days<br> of diplomacy. Four days back.<br> - Ben, could I talk to you a minute?<br> - After I say goodbye to the family.<br> I'll miss you.<br> When I get you on the phone,<br> tell me what presents you want.<br> - I already know what I want.<br> - Don't tell me now. Think about it.<br> - I need money, Ben. $50,000.<br> - For what?<br> The cops, the D.A., the FBI.<br> They're threatening to lock me up.<br> They're no good, these people,<br> except assistant D.A. Allen Stein.<br> Jewish kid.<br> His family's from Bedford Street.<br> What happened to the 50,000<br> for the armoured truck heist?<br> It's gone. You know me with money,<br> I blew it at the track.<br> Are you saying that if you don't<br> get it you're going to rat on me?<br> You? Never. I love you, Ben.<br> I would never rat on you.<br> You ain't gonna kill me, are you?<br> I'm going to try very hard<br> to forget that this ever happened.<br> - I owe you my life, Ben.<br> - I'd say that's a fair assessment.<br> Bend your knees, Harry.<br> When you jump from the train, bend<br> your knees to soften the impact.<br> Okay, Ben. Sure thing.<br> This has been four of the most<br> wonderful days I've ever spent.<br> A lot of it<br> was in the motion of the train.<br> He knows you.

I'll drop you,<br> then run back to the studio.<br> - Why don't I go with you?<br> - If you like.<br> Hank's my friend. A dame like you<br> will give him a lot of headaches.<br> - I'm on to you.<br> - The blueprints are all drawn.<br> - New cigarette.<br> - She's eaten a whole cigarette.<br> Forget that you've ever seen him.<br> Here, get what I mean?<br> Take that money<br> and buy yourself some manners.<br> To waste on you?<br> Two bucks for one beer<br> and some phoney champagne?<br> Here's half a buck.<br> Split it between you.<br> Two bucks for one beer<br> and some phoney champagne?<br> - Here's half a buck.<br> - You're so cheap you're wholesale.<br> Don't forget, mister,<br> I asked you nice.<br> Rolling, quiet please.<br> Benny, you want to hit somebody<br> with a chair?<br> With this<br> I can hit home runs all night.<br> - Take this in case I come back.<br> - Can't I have a line?<br> Honey, he's the star.<br> - That was impressive, Georgie boy.<br> - I'm a pro.<br> May I?<br> If you want an answer,<br> finish the question.<br> - Light your cigarette?<br> - Sure.<br> I thought you were going to ask me<br> something a little more exciting.<br> - Like what?<br> - Use your imagination.<br> - I'm using it.<br> - Let me know when you're finished.<br> Is she a bit player?<br> Flamingo? Not for Joey Adonis.<br> That's Virginia Hill.<br> Joey's crazy. No woman is worth<br> a bullet between the eyes.<br> It depends on whose eyes<br> and which woman.<br> Why is Ben Siegel so interested in<br> a gal who's going with his friend?<br> Joey A? He's just an associate.<br> Are you still going with him?<br> If it were New Year's Eve, he'd be<br> my date. Who would your date be?<br> Wife. Esta. E-S-T-A.<br> I'll bet Esta lives her life<br> faithful to her one and only Ben, -<br> - who plays around like a jackrabbit<br> and lies through his teeth.<br> - I don't lie to Esta.<br> - Do you confess your sins to her?<br> What exactly does Mr. Esta<br> want from Miss Virginia?<br> Mr. Esta can't imagine anything<br> he doesn't want from Miss Virginia.<br> - Are you ready for a divorce?<br> - Never.<br> You're pretty ferocious<br> where Mom is concerned.<br> The rest of the time you're just<br> a sweet-talking, fuck-happy fellow -<br> - with some good dialogue.<br> Dialogue's cheap in Hollywood.<br> Why don't you run outside<br> and jerk yourself a soda?<br> How would someone go about<br> getting a screen test done?<br> - Do you know someone who wants one?<br> - No, I'm just interested.<br> What about Virginia Hill?<br> Does she have a future in movies?<br> I'm not sure of my own future.<br> Lana Turner lives there.<br> Cesar Romero lives there.<br> Gary Cooper is there on the right.<br> He paid 45 grand.<br> - Houses bring that kind of money?<br> - Sure, and more.<br> - Who's is that?<br> - Lawrence... The opera singer.<br> - Not Melchoir, the other guy.<br> - Lawrence Tibbett? Stop.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Paying my respects.<br> I'm looking for Lawrence Tibbett.<br> My name's Ben Siegel.<br> - Is he expecting you?<br> - Not unless he's psychic.<br> Would you excuse me a moment?<br> - How far is your house from here?<br> - Half a mile. What are you doing?<br> Mr. Siegel.<br> You have no idea<br> what an honour it is to meet you.<br> I took my family to hear you sing<br> "Rigoletto" at the Met last year.<br> - It was a great evening.<br> - You overwhelm me, Mr. Siegel.<br> - That's beautiful.<br> - Are you related to Bugsy Siegel?<br> - "Bugsy"? What do you mean?<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> A bug is nothing.<br> The word has no meaning.<br> A bug is a colloquialism.<br> It has no basis in reality.<br> Insects include a wide variety<br> of living creatures.<br> None of them can be called a bug!<br> I certainly didn't mean<br> any offence, Mr. Siegel.<br> Mind if I look around, Larry?<br> - Do you mind if I call you Larry?<br> - All my friends call me Larry.<br> - What brings you to L.A., Ben?<br> - Curiosity.<br> A wonderful house. What do you<br> think of the Beverly Hills Hotel?<br> - It's the best hotel in town.<br> - A bungalow or a suite?<br> - A bungalow. Which do you have?<br> - I don't. You do. Bungalow 5.<br> - I don't understand...<br> - I'm buying this house.<br> - This house isn't for sale.<br> - Sure it is. Everything's for sale.<br> - How much do you want?<br> - Mr. Siegel...<br> - Ben.<br> - Ben...<br> Why are you looking at me like that?<br> Are you going to hurt me?<br> I would protect you<br> from anyone who tried to hurt you.<br> Your voice makes life justifiable.<br> I'm just trying to give you money.<br> - What did you buy it for?<br> - $35,000.<br> But that was a few years ago.<br> I could probably get $40,000.<br> It's not really a financial issue,<br> Mr. Siegel. Ben...<br> One, two, three, four...<br> That's $50,000. Is that enough?<br> This should be a pleasurable day<br> for the both of us. Here's $60,000.<br> It makes me sick inside when I don't<br> bring pleasure to someone I admire.<br> Doesn't this bring you pleasure?<br> Why don't I see you smiling?<br> - You spend money like crazy.<br> - So? It's only dirty paper.<br> - You'll only be here for four days.<br> - Maybe I'll stay a little longer.<br> - I've got to get to Jack Dragna's.<br> - I'll drive you.<br> No, this is business.<br> - Nice car.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Louie.<br> - What the hell is this?<br> I'm looking for Jack Dragna.<br> I'm Ben Siegel.<br> I'm Lou, Jack's brother.<br> I'll tell Jack you're here.<br> He'll just be a few seconds.<br> Jack's finishing eating.<br> We run a smooth little operation.<br> With all due respect to Lansky, -<br> - Luciano, Joey A., and whoever<br> the fuck else you represent, -<br> - I suggest you spend your time here<br> looking for broads.<br> We've got the finest in the world.<br> I understand that's what you like.<br> I can help you out<br> with phone numbers.<br> But if you want to do business,<br> I'm completely disinterested.<br> "Uninterested".<br> Disinterested means impartial.<br> You've got two alternatives:<br> You and your guys can work for us.<br> Your little operation<br> will then be a big operation.<br> Owning your own wire service.<br> It means taking risks.<br> Meyer, Charlie and I, we take 75%.<br> You keep 25%, but that's got to be<br> three times more than you make now.<br> - What's the second alternative?<br> - The second alternative...<br> The second alternative is here.<br> - Squeeze the trigger and kill me.<br> - Kill you, that's an alternative?<br> - You've an unusual sense of humour.<br> - What they say about you is true.<br> You're out of your fucking mind.<br> Take another five seconds<br> to make your selection.<br> I guess that means you're working<br> for us. May I have my gun back?<br> Let's get started. Time is vicious<br> when taken for granted.<br> Bugsy, if we break off this thing<br> with Transcontinental...<br> I'll assume you didn't know<br> that no one calls me that.<br> - Very nice meeting you, Jack.<br> - The fucking guy's crazy.<br> - Should I shoot him in the back?<br> - Lansky and Luciano would flip.<br> Play along.<br> Sooner or later he'll blow his lid.<br> When we get him,<br> nobody will give a fuck.<br> - Hello?<br> - Virginia, it's Ben...<br> Meyer, I know we said 12 days.<br> Things got a little complicated.<br> Was that good?<br> You're from "The Herald", right?<br> See that they run that, and not one<br> of those sinister mugshots.<br> - I'll try my best.<br> - I'd really appreciate it.<br> - May I have the next dance?<br> - Charmed. Have you met Mr. Siegel?<br> - I've been admiring his movements.<br> - My husband. Count Di Frasso.<br> I'm surrounded by titles.<br> How can I pick one up?<br> Darling, get him a title.<br> Make him a duke.<br> Why not?<br> - Are you ready to come to Italy?<br> - Italy! I'll get my parachute.<br> That's wonderful.<br> You know who one of the count's<br> best friends is?<br> Mussolini.<br> No... That clown knows Mussolini?<br> Do they play golf together?<br> Tell jokes about the gas chambers?<br> - I stay out of politics.<br> - Politics?

I have found the answer<br> to the dreams of America.<br> You want to be<br> a little more specific?<br> The Flamingo.<br> - People dream about sex and money.<br> - Are you building a whorehouse?<br> A hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br> A place where gambling is allowed.<br> The whole territory is wide open.<br> A palace, an oasis, a city.<br> When the Hoover Dam is finished,<br> electrical power will be available.<br> The Hoover Dam and fucking<br> are connected how?<br> Air-conditioning.<br> The wave of the future.<br> Every room will be 72 degrees<br> at all times.<br> We'll put Monte Carlo to shame.<br> Wall-to-wall carpeting,<br> Italian marble, stables.<br> A train from L.A. to Vegas.<br> Planes back and forth.<br> We'll have our own airport!<br> It's a good place to trap people in<br> to take their money.<br> - Is that what you're getting at?<br> - Much more.<br> I've got to get that.<br> I got it!<br> Mickey, have you got someone<br> across the street?<br> Call Warner Brothers, call Ciro's.<br> Call me if anybody's seen her.<br> No, not five minutes.

It's like another state.<br> It's not another state. A foreign<br> country can always throw you out.<br> Nevada is another state<br> and it's open.<br> If we follow the hotel with schools,<br> and churches and synagogues, -<br> - we'll be in charge before<br> you know it... of the whole state!<br> - We'll have a stake in the country.<br> - You planning to run for president?<br> We can help to choose the president<br> if we control a state.<br> Where do you think the money<br> for this is going to come from?<br> I'll be working for the partners,<br> so the money should come from them.<br> - Them meaning you.<br> - How much are we talking about?<br> - One million dollars.<br> - What about the publicity?<br> Ben's famous in California.<br> Famous is good for Clark Gable,<br> but for you it's not good.<br> Our gambling will be legitimate.<br> Meyer, we've known each other<br> since we were too young to fuck.<br> When did I ever ask you to leap<br> ahead with something on faith?<br> Never, but I'm asking you now.<br> Do this.<br> You've got 65 guys on the payroll<br> and nobody can find Virginia?<br> I cannot function effectively<br> when I'm in a state of ignorance.<br> Find her.<br> Hold the fort.

We came here to do business.<br> Millicent? I lit the candles.<br> - Have we finished our business?<br> - Sure, we shouldn't have barged in.<br> Enjoy the party for Millicent.<br> It sounds good.<br> - Take care, Ben.<br> - Thanks for coming by.<br> Joey...<br> Listen, I'm sorry about Virginia.<br> If you want to take a punch at me,<br> take a punch at me.<br> We're even now. I'm sorry,<br> I know you were in love with her.<br> Are you kidding me? I'd never<br> let myself fall for a slut like her.<br> Your mouth is bleeding.<br> I tripped and hit the table.<br> It's nothing.<br> I don't think<br> we can go on like this, Ben.<br> - Like what?<br> - Should we get a divorce?<br> Some friends just dropped by at the<br> wrong time. Everything's fine now.<br> Sit down.<br> I'm going to say goodnight<br> to the girls.<br> - Miss me?<br> - Depends.<br> You're looking very smug.<br> Did you ask her for a divorce?<br> We've got to drink a toast.<br> I've got the whole thing worked out.<br> I've sold them on the idea.<br> We'll drink a toast to our destiny.<br> - Did you ask her for a divorce?<br> - Not in so many words.<br> Do me a favour, would you? Finish<br> your drink and get out of here.<br> You don't understand.<br> I'm laying the groundwork.<br> Are you having a good time?<br> Do you like that robe?<br> You fucking lunatic!<br> Look what you've done.<br> - Baby, are you hurt?<br> - You're lucky you're alive.<br> I'll give you three minutes<br> to get the hell out of here.<br> - He's my brother, you asshole!<br> - Do you expect me to fall for that?<br> I don't care. Just don't ever come<br> around here bothering us anymore!<br> - Us?<br> - Leave him alone! He's my brother.<br> Would you show me<br> some form of identification?<br> - Do you have any?<br> - In my pants, in the guests' room.<br> He does very unexpected things.<br> Are you hurt? Are you cut?<br> Any glass wedged anywhere?<br> You're right. You're Chick.<br> You're her brother.<br> Why didn't you tell me it was Chick?<br> - I'm gonna buy you a Cadillac.<br> - A Cadillac?<br> Yes, a red one.<br> How about a convertible?<br> - Don't sell out so cheap.<br> - I've always wanted a Cadillac.<br> We're gonna take a trip<br> in Chick's red Cadillac.<br> - You're gonna take a trip.<br> - To our destiny. Las Vegas!<br> You couldn't drag me to that<br> sand-hole, rat-trap with a fish net.<br> We're going to build<br> a Garden of Eden.<br> A hotel, but not a hotel.<br> An oasis with a casino.<br> It's legal. It's Nevada.<br> Palm trees and pools.

What's with this red tie?<br> Hey, he's an architect.<br> Keep an eye on him. What's<br> his history? How did we get him?<br> - Don't do this to yourself.<br> - I've got to know the truth.<br> Who ever knows what's going on<br> in the mind of any broad?<br> What are you looking at?<br> You're looking at Virginia.<br> - She was talking.<br> - What were you thinking?<br> Should you trust a dame<br> with your chequebook?<br> I've never known a broad<br> I could trust.<br> I'm not trusting a broad,<br> I'm trusting Virginia.<br> Meyer would like to talk to you.<br> Where are you, Miami?

Then let us out now.<br> At cost, no profits.<br> Stop all this nonsense. This is<br> a farewell party for old friends.<br> You don't tell old friends a deal's<br> going to cost one million dollars -<br> - and then come back and say<br> that it's two, or three, or four.<br> Not to Charlie Luciano.<br> We're talking different languages,<br> that's the problem.<br> Tell me one thing. What is the most<br> that this hotel could possibly cost?<br> - Three million.<br> - I only approved one, not three.<br> - I don't want in, but I am in.<br> - It doesn't matter. We're stuck.<br> We do what we have to do,<br> to make it work... within reason.<br> You call any of this reason?<br> It's disgusting.<br> If this costs over three million,<br> God won't be able to baiI you out.<br> - No problem.<br> - One more thing, Ben.<br> The broad... Why would you have<br> some broad handle our money?<br> Speak about Virginia with respect,<br> she's going to be my wife.<br> Congratulations. I'm sure<br> she'll make a terrific Mrs. Siegel.<br> I hope you know what you're doing.<br> Don't let Virginia<br> out of your sight.<br> If you have to take a nap, have<br> one of the other guys watch her.<br> One of the older guys.<br> Joey...<br> - Can I speak to you alone?<br> - What do you want? I'm busy.<br> It won't take a second.<br> Don't move, darling. I'll get rid<br> of this guy before you can blink.<br> Make it quick.<br> Considering the insulting word<br> you used to describe Virginia, -<br> - I think<br> that you owe both of us an apology.<br> Why don't you suck your apology<br> out of my dick?<br> Joey, what a thing to say!<br> Pull it out.<br> Are you embarrassed?<br> You want me to pull mine out first?<br> Take a look at this.<br> Can you hear me, Joey? You're<br> lucky I didn't drink a lot today.<br> Your apology's accepted.<br> - Are you chewing?<br> - I'm chewing.<br> Don't swallow anything<br> untiI you chew it well.<br> I was thinking that...<br> Could I have some more water?<br> I was thinking that...<br> - Anybody want anything else?<br> - You just said that.<br> Right... What was I saying?<br> You've been trying to say it<br> all night. Our plans for moving.<br> What I was thinking was that...<br> I was trying to figure out<br> what would be best for...<br> I'm going to be in Las Vegas.<br> It's nothing but a sand dune.<br> I'll be there with the workmen.<br> I don't know...<br> You could live<br> in the house in Los Angeles.<br> But I'm not going to be there.<br> Maybe it would be best for you to<br> stay here where you feel at home.<br> And see you for a day or two<br> every couple of years?<br> Excuse me.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - You've found someone, haven't you?<br> You want to be with her.<br> I want a divorce.<br> Is that what you want?<br> I want to take care<br> of you and the children.<br> You want a divorce, don't you?<br> Say it. Answer me.<br> You want a divorce, don't you?<br> You want a divorce. Say it.<br> I do.<br> Don't come out of this room<br> for a minute.<br> This is a spectacular sight.<br> It's breathtaking.<br> It's vast,<br> it's intimate, it's original.<br> - Where's the pool?<br> - Right through here.<br> Can't I see the pool<br> from the casino?<br> - You wanted the pool in the sun.<br> - I thought you'd be able to see it.<br> When you stand in the casino,<br> you must be able to see the pool.<br> The problem is<br> that this is a bearing wall.<br> - Get rid of it.<br> - It supports the whole structure.<br> - You understand?<br> - I've got the point.<br> I don't need you to parrot<br> everything this guy says.<br> Just get rid of the wall.<br> We can make it glass, but it'll<br> cost. I can put a header beam up.<br> A header beam! You saved the day.<br> The overages have pushed<br> the budget up. Virginia, what is it?<br> - 4 million.<br> - No problem.<br> - Do you understand our position?<br> - I'm going to do this right.<br> Who the hell are they?<br> - Bugsy Siegel, you're under arrest.<br> - I don't know anybody of that name.<br> Benjamin Siegel,<br> you're under arrest.<br> I have a court order directing me<br> to transport you across state lines.<br> - What's the charge?<br> - Homicide.<br> Is it true that Harry Greenberg<br> was your best friend?<br> - Are you guilty?<br> - Are you getting divorced?<br> Is it true Harry Greenberg was going<br> to testify against all your friends?<br> Bugsy, give us a statement.<br> Firstly, my name is Benjamin,<br> as in the Bible.<br> And second, I'll see you all when<br> the Flamingo opens on Christmas Day.<br> I'm Assistant D.A. Hartman.<br> I'm in charge of this case.<br> You can leave the prisoner with me.<br> This way, sir.<br> Don't let anybody else inside.<br> Tell me, was $30,000 towards<br> your campaign fund not enough?<br> - The walls are thin here.<br> - You've got no witnesses.<br> The taxi driver who dropped<br> Harry Greenberg off at your house.<br> You got a name?<br> I want it to accidentally<br> fall into the hands of Mickey Cohen.<br> - Fine, but nothing nasty.<br> - You don't have to warn me.<br> Considering the gravity<br> of the charges against you, -<br> - I order you held without bail.<br> Mickey, are you in Vegas?<br> Did you fix the cab driver problem?<br> My picture was in the "Examiner". It<br> makes me look like I've got no tan.<br> I look like a fucking marshmallow.<br> You're trying to make me feel good.<br> Tanned or not tanned?<br> - Tanned.<br> - Really?<br> Stay on top of Virginia.<br> I feel very isolated here.<br> All right, good.<br> - Things are starting to shape up.<br> - He wants to open at Christmas.<br> - He's absolutely determined.<br> - Ben is absolutely determined.<br> Meyer, it'll open on time.<br> You've changed a lot<br> since I first met you.<br> - You didn't say Meyer was there.<br> - I wanted to tell you in person.<br> - So he saw the Flamingo?<br> - He's worried about the cost.<br> - What else did he say?<br> - Nothing. He talked to Del Webb.<br> - Did he ask any specific questions?<br> - He saw the demolished wall.<br> - What about the header beam?<br> - He ducked under it.<br> It's low... too low,<br> unless you're under five foot six.<br> But it hasn't been fixed yet.<br> - What was his general attitude?<br> - Concern.<br> But he was very nice,<br> like he's always been.<br> - Always?<br> - As in the past.<br> - Did you know him in the past?<br> - Yes, through Joey.<br> - Did you fuck him?<br> - Sure.<br> - Did you fuck Meyer?<br> - Don't be disgusting. I meant Joey.<br> Is fucking Meyer any more<br> disgusting than fucking Joey?<br> Fucking Joey wasn't disgusting?<br> What is it with you and Joey?<br> You don't want to fuck Meyer,<br> you want to fuck Joey?<br> If they can't get it right, tell<br> them to start again from scratch.<br> I won't have a casino<br> that doesn't let me see the pool.<br> - Tear down the fucking casino.<br> - The cost is going haywire.<br> - Are you on their side now?<br> - Don't say that.<br> The hell with Meyer Lansky,<br> Las Vegas and the Flamingo!<br> I talked to Meyer<br> in the middle of a sand blizzard.<br> I tried to say things<br> that I thought you would say.<br> He even said I sounded like you.<br> I wish we were back at Coney Island<br> eating hot dogs at Nathan's.<br> You're gonna love Kansas.<br> I've got you a job as a cab driver.<br> That's where Dorothy's from,<br> in the "Wizard of Oz".<br> Don't send any postcards.<br> Extra!<br> Bugsy Siegel gets off scot-free.<br> Cary Grant, Gary Cooper<br> and Clark Gable.<br> This is the biggest<br> gala opening in history.<br> You are a prince of princes.<br> - See you back at the house.<br> - Any more bags, you carry yourself.<br> The Flamingo's gonna come in<br> at six million.<br> I'm on your side. Stop trying<br> to fool me and fool yourself.<br> You need three million.<br> If you can come up with two,<br> I can come up with one.<br> This is just between you and me.<br> Can you get it?<br> - No problem.<br> - Would you stop that and think?<br> The house in Scarsdale, the cars,<br> the stocks, the bonds...<br> That all belongs to Esta now,<br> correct?<br> - Absolutely.<br> - How can you get the money?<br> I'll sell my house<br> and everything in it.<br> Sounds like about $200,000.<br> Where's the other 1.8 million?<br> You always protected me<br> when we were kids.<br> But I can't protect you.<br> My shares. I own<br> a third of the hotel. I'll sell it.<br> But that's all you've got.<br> You'll end up with nothing.<br> The Flamingo will be there.<br> That's not nothing.<br> Add your two to this.<br> I miss you, Benny.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> we begin with item number one.<br> - Sold to the lady in the white hat.<br> - $2,750. Yes or no?<br> This oriental rug.<br> I'll sell you both<br> - Aren't the shares already sold?<br> - Not if I'm still selling them.<br> - Look who's here.<br> - How you doing, Ben?<br> - So... did you miss the desert?<br> - That's not why I came.<br> Why did you come?<br> - What did she do?<br> - She fucked you.<br> There's a Swiss bank account<br> with almost $2 million in it.<br> - So?<br> - It's hers.<br> There's a lot of Swiss bank accounts<br> with $2 million in them.<br> Only one opened by Joe Epstein<br> for Virginia Hill.<br> I've seen copies<br> of the deposit records.<br> It's a lie.<br> Epstein has worked for me.<br> He has no reason to lie to me.<br> It's a lie. You repeat it,<br> I'll break your fucking jaw.<br> Can I get a glass of water?<br> Get those cases out of my sight.<br> I've told you, when we're here,<br> we don't want to see the boxes.<br> I haven't seen a single case<br> where I told you to put it.<br> - Excuse me... All right?<br> - I'm Natalie St. Clair.<br> Mr. Webb said I might be able<br> to work at the Flamingo.<br> - As what?<br> - Well, anything you might need.<br> - What kind of job would you like?<br> - Bartender or hatcheck girl.<br> Did you come in from Hollywood?<br> Did you fly in?<br> I love to fly,<br> but I couldn't afford to.<br> Looking for a girl who likes to fly?<br> Virginia, I want to talk to you.<br> Virginia... Sugar.<br> We don't have time for this.<br> Shit! You almost got me<br> in the head again.<br> You were chasing some bimbo.<br> She's an employee.<br> She's going to be a hatcheck girl.<br> - You shattered Baccarat crystal.<br> - You just shattered us!<br> I'm not going to defend myself.<br> She wanted a job.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Leaving. Don't try to stop me.<br> I should have gone<br> the day you killed Harry.<br> Where are you going?<br> To a numbered bank account?<br> What fantasy have you concocted<br> in your sick mind?<br> - Just ask what you want to ask.<br> - How much money is in the account?<br> Why?<br> You want to sell me a few shares?<br> You gave me 53I 4%.<br> You want to sell me another 10%?<br> That's about 400% sold by now.<br> Answer the question. How much<br> money have you stolen from the hotel?<br> With all the work I've done, -<br> - I'd be justified in taking<br> anything I can get my hands on.<br> I haven't. I could have taken a lot.<br> You'd never have known.<br> You irresponsible, unrealistic,<br> unreliable, philandering fuck!<br> I should have taken something,<br> but it isn't in me -<br> - to violate the trust of a person<br> I've been stupid enough to love.<br> How much money<br> do you have in the account?<br> - How much did you steal?<br> - Bye-bye, Ben. You're on your own.<br> Thanks for taking the time<br> to fly down here -<br> - to a lonely Italian exile<br> with a swollen prostate gland.<br> This tragic mess with the Flamingo -<br> - is being perpetrated by one<br> of my oldest friends. Benny Siegel.<br> Here's where we stand. The Flamingo<br> will open on Christmas Day.<br> My hotel friends tell me that's the<br> stupidest time to open a new joint.<br> The total cost is now $6 million.<br> That's $5 million more than agreed.<br> To get the last few million<br> he needed, -<br> - Benny has had to sell<br> He's sold to famous movie stars<br> and wealthy businessmen.<br> They ain't just going to roll over<br> when it's time to collect.<br> If there is a time to collect<br> in this whole fucking fiasco.<br> Now all of this is nothing<br> compared to the most serious matter.<br> The question of stealing.<br> My banking friends in Switzerland<br> tell me that Virginia Hill...<br> This broad that Joey A. Used to fuck<br> and Benny's in love with...<br> She's pulled off a couple of million<br> from this here deal.<br> There's a simple basic question<br> we have to ask:<br> Did this broad steal this money<br> without Benny knowing about it, -<br> - or is she just fronting for Benny?<br> Anybody who thinks Bugsy Siegel<br> didn't know is crazy.<br> His name's Ben.<br> There's no need for disrespect.<br> - What about his disrespect to us?<br> - Benny's got to take the rap.<br> I agree with Joey and Frank.<br> What about the rest of you? Meyer?<br> I don't believe he knew anything.<br> He was blinded by love.<br> Benny always put women first.<br> This time it's one woman that's got<br> him, and not the whole female race.<br> Benny accepted what she told him.<br> There's no chance he stole from us.<br> He didn't know.<br> Benny's basic problem<br> is he doesn't respect money.<br> He's not even interested in this<br> money. He's interested in the idea.<br> - What idea?<br> - Building something.<br> He's a dreamer. I'm not excusing it.<br> I'm a businessman.<br> Anything that broad took,<br> Benny's got to make good on.<br> What do you want to do about it...<br> as a businessman?<br> Wait and see if the hotel works.<br> If it does, we'll all be happy.<br> - Let him pay off her debt.<br> - What if the Flamingo goes bust?<br> Then I'll handle it myself.<br> doing handstands on the carpet.<br> doing handstands on the carpet.<br> - What about Gable and Cooper?<br> - Not a word.<br> Worst luck I've ever seen.<br> You can do all kinds of things,<br> but you can't control the weather.<br> You can't lose heart.<br> Go back and check the fuse box.<br> - What the hell is going on?<br> - Can we get some flashlights?<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> thank you for coming tonight, -<br> - to try and make the opening<br> of the Flamingo a success.<br> Due to the implementation<br> of further refinements, -<br> - which will make the Flamingo<br> an even greater place, -<br> - I am announcing a temporary<br> closure effective from Friday night.<br> I hope to see you all<br> at the reopening of the hotel, -<br> - the date of which will be<br> announced soon. Thank you...<br> Meyer Lansky's on the phone.<br> He wants to talk to you.<br> Meyer... No, we're shutting down<br> temporarily...<br> Why would I fly to L.A. tonight<br> to see Gus and Moe?<br> Meyer, I want you<br> to do something for me.<br> Promise me, no matter what<br> happens, you'll protect Virginia.<br> Give me your word on that,<br> and I'll go to L.A. tonight.<br> Good.<br> Meyer, you want a tip?<br> Keep your shares in the Flamingo.<br> You'll live to thank me.<br> I'm sorry, Ben.<br> I should have been with you.<br> You're here now.<br> You're the only one.<br> - They told me you're going to L.A.<br> - I'm meeting Gus and Moe.<br> If you're going to L.A. for money,<br> you may not need it.<br> What do you mean?<br> $2 million.<br> I always said you were a better<br> businessman than I was.<br> I don't get it.<br> I don't know...<br> Maybe I took it for us.<br> Maybe I took it for me.<br> You get a little confused<br> and you get afraid...<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe I thought it'd buy us a couple<br> of hot dogs at Coney Island.<br> I'll tell you what, why don't<br> we just leave it in the bank?<br> Save it for a rainy day.<br> - I've got to go.<br> - You want me to go with you?<br> Fly? In this weather?<br> I see.<br> Get out of here.<br> I'll be back in a couple of hours.<br> I love you, Ben.<br> You've got Virginia all wrong.<br> - She was willing to fly for me.<br> - Let's not talk about Virginia.<br> All right, goodnight.<br> - I'm on to your racket.<br> - The blueprints are all drawn.<br> You've got a line, sister, but it<br> don't make a wife for a right guy.<br> I'm telling you straight.<br> Forget that you've ever seen him.<br> Yeah, you've got a line, but it<br> don't make a wife for a right guy.<br> I'm telling you straight,<br> forget that you've ever seen him.<br> If you don't get what I mean...<br> this might give you an idea.<br> Meyer Lansky sent us. We're<br> taking over control of the hotel.<br> Ben Siegel controls The Flamingo.<br> Bugsy Siegel is dead.<br> The Flamingo belongs to us.<br>
