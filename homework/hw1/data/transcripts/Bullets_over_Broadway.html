It's real.<br> It makes a point. It's confrontational.<br> - Then why won't you produce it?<br> - Because I cannot afford<br> another failure.<br> - David, the play's too heavy.<br> - But not everybody writes to distract.<br> - [ Groans ]<br> - It's the theater's duty<br> not just to entertain...<br> - but to transform men's souls.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> You're not at one of your sidewalk cafes<br> in Greenwich Village. This is Broadway.<br> - You said you believed in my play!<br> - What do you want me to say?<br> I'm tapped out. Maybe if we got some<br> big-time director interested...<br> - I could scare up backers--<br> - No, no, no. I'm directing this play.<br> Ohh, will you listen to this guy?<br> Where's your track record?<br> I won't see my work mangled again.<br> I've been through this twice before.<br> Two powerful scripts,<br> could have been tremendous successes...<br> and I had to watch actors change<br> my dialogue and directors<br> misinterpret everything!<br> I know. I know.<br> You're an artist.<br> Let me tell you, kid, that's the<br> real world out there, and it's<br> a lot rougher than you think.<br> Ma<br> He's makin' eyes at me<br> Ma<br> He's awful nice to me<br> Ma, he's almost<br> breakin' my heart<br> What are you waitin' for?<br> Kill them!<br> Come on. Let's go<br> get somethin' to eat.<br> - I feel like eatin' ribs.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> I gotta go shoot crap at Tommy's. He's<br> got a game at the Ansonia. I gotta go.<br> Somebody's got to let<br> Mr. Valenti know what's going on.<br> He's at the Three Deuces.<br> - Why don't you go tell him?<br> - I promised Bobby Doyle.<br> I can't do nothin'.<br> - I gotta shoot a game.<br> - What's a matter, Cheech? Don't<br> you wanna baby-sit his girl?<br> His girlfriend's<br> a pain in my ass.<br> You gotta see Mama<br> every night<br> Or you can't see Mama<br> at all<br> You gotta kiss Mama<br> Treat her right<br> Or she won't be home<br> when you call<br> Now if you want<br> my company<br> - Here, doll, take care of this hat.<br> - You can't fifty-fifty me<br> - Mr. V. here?<br> - Yeah, right this way.<br> -Nice crowd.<br> -Yeah, we're packin' 'em in every night.<br> - Right here.<br> - Monday night I sat alone<br> Tuesday night<br> you didn't phone<br> Wednesday night<br> you didn't call<br> - Done.<br> - Now that's a load<br> off my mind. How many?<br> - Four.<br> - This means we ain't heard the last.<br> You know Kustabeck's gonna have a fit,<br> but he'll run scared.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Listen, a deal's a deal.<br> - We got midtown. I mean, eh...<br> Mr. Valenti does.<br> - [ Whistling ]<br> I don't want that kind<br> of a sheik<br> Who does his sheiking<br> once a week<br> You gotta see Mama<br> every night<br> Or you can't see<br> You can't see Mama<br> at all<br> Not at all.<br> [ Applause ]<br> I'm fed up!<br> I'm fed up, do you hear me?<br> You can push your torpedoes around all<br> you want, but I've had it up to here!<br> - What is it now?<br> - I am not sharing a dressing room.<br> I am tired of getting<br> bumped into and stepped on.<br> None of these bimbos knows how to dance.<br> - Bimbos!<br> - They're the best line in New York.<br> - Bullshit! Bullshit!<br> - Oh, knock it off.<br> - Hey, clam up over there.<br> Olive, come on.<br> - What?<br> - Olive, it's our anniversary.<br> - It's not our anniversary.<br> -You're getting senile.<br> -It's September 28. Six months to today.<br> - So?<br> - I remember it like it was yesterday...<br> 'cause that's the morning<br> we broke Joey Benjamin's legs.<br> - Six months? Six months!<br> - Yeah. Six months.<br> - And I'm still stuck<br> in this crummy rat trap!<br> - Olive. I brought you somethin'.<br> - What is it?<br> - Open it.<br> - No, you open it.<br> Can't you see I'm dressing?<br> - I'll open it. Here. Hey.<br> - What is it?<br> - Pearls! What the hell<br> do you think they are?<br> - Pearls are white.<br> - These are black pearls.<br> Don't give me that!<br> I never heard of black pearls.<br> Just 'cause you never heard of somethin'<br> don't mean it don't exist.<br> What do you think I am? Some kind<br> of chump? They're black, for God's sake.<br> - They probably came<br> from defective oysters.<br> - The pearls ain't sick.<br> Black pearls, they're supposed--<br> What? They're supposed to be black!<br> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> - Don't be that way.<br> You know I'm nuts about you.<br> If you're nuts about me, Nickie,<br> why don't you get me out<br> of this lousy chorus line?<br> I came to New York to be an actress.<br> That's where my gifts are.<br> You will, baby. You'll be a great<br> actress. A promise is a promise.<br> - Yeah, I--<br> - Come on. Get yourself dressed.<br> I'm takin' you to Harlem.<br> - The Cotton Club?<br> - Yeah, baby. [ Chuckles ]<br> [ David ] I'm telling you,<br> they read my play, they love it.<br> But they're afraid of it.<br> - [ Man ] It's irrelevant.<br> - It's not irrelevant!<br> The point<br> I'm making is that...<br> no truly great artist has ever<br> been appreciated in his lifetime.<br> - Not one?<br> - No, no.<br> - Flender.<br> - Take, uh, uh... Van Gogh<br> or Edgar Allen Poe.<br> Poe died poor and freezing<br> with his cat curled on his feet.<br> David, don't give up on it.<br> Maybe it'll be produced posthumously.<br> You know, I-I-I have never<br> had a play produced-- That's right.<br> - And I've written one play every<br> year for the past 20 years.<br> - That's because you're a genius.<br> The proof is that both common<br> people and intellectuals find<br> your work completely incoherent.<br> - It means you're a genius.<br> - We all have our moments of doubt.<br> I paint a canvas every week, take one<br> look at it and slash it with a razor.<br> - Well, in your case that's a good idea.<br> - I have faith in your plays.<br> - She has faith in my plays<br> because she loves me.<br> - Also because you're a genius.<br> Ten years ago, I-I-I kidnapped<br> this woman from a very beautiful...<br> middle-class life in Pittsburgh, and<br> I made her life miserable ever since.<br> Hey, Ellen, as long<br> as he's a good man, keep him.<br> You know, I think the mistake<br> we women make is we fall<br> in love with the artist--<br> - Hey, you guys, are you listening?<br> - Yes, yes.<br> - We fall in love with<br> the artist, not the man.<br> - I don't think that's a mistake.<br> - How is that a mistake?<br> - [ Woman ] The artist makes the man.<br> She's right. You can't<br> separate 'em. No, look. Say<br> there was a burning building...<br> and you could rush in, and<br> you could save only one thing:<br> either the last known copy<br> of Shakespeare's plays or<br> some anonymous human being.<br> - You cannot--<br> - What would you do?<br> - You cannot deprive the world<br> of those plays.<br> - Correct.<br> - Phone call, David.<br> - [ Girl ] It's an inanimate object.<br> It's not an inanimate object!<br> It's art! Art is life! It lives!<br> We got the money.<br> We can do the play.<br> What? When? How?<br> A single backer<br> goin' for the whole show.<br> An old acquaintance. I'm up<br> at the Cotton Club. I ran into him.<br> - And no hitches?<br> - Well, uh--<br> We'll meet tomorrow and discuss it,<br> all right? Luxor Baths. Noon.<br> Are you nuts? You think I'm gonna let<br> some amateur play the lead in my play?<br> Did I say "lead"?<br> Did I say "lead," Mr. Genius?<br> - Some guy's girlfriend 'cause<br> he's puttin' up the money?<br> - Did I say "lead"?<br> I said a part, a role.<br> I thought maybe Dr. Philips.<br> - The psychiatrist? It's a key role.<br> - What key role?<br> - It's a small part. Key role!<br> - Who is this woman anyway?<br> Olive Neal? I don't even know what<br> she looks like, much less can she act.<br> He says she's the stuff<br> that stars are made of.<br> That's 'cause he's in love with her.<br> And who is he anyway?<br> - His name is Nick Valenti.<br> - How-How-- How do I know<br> that name? What's he do?<br> - Ah, he's got his finger<br> in a number of pies.<br> - I don't like the sound of this.<br> - Look, you wanna<br> get your play on or not?<br> - I gotta meet her first.<br> - So you'll meet her.<br> - I'm conflicted.<br> -You'll meet her. That's all I'm saying.<br> -The psychiatrist is not small.<br> It's not the lead. It's-- It's a<br> small part. Who do you see in the lead?<br> - I don't know.<br> - What about Helen Sinclair?<br> Oh, sure. I mean, she'd be great.<br> But can we get her?<br> Why can't we get her? She's been in<br> nothin' but flops the past three years.<br> Yeah, but she's<br> a major actress.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Was.<br> She'd be great.<br> I mean, really, she's brilliant.<br> - She possess the necessary fire.<br> For the part, she'd be great.<br> - You really think so?<br> - I'm glad you think so.<br> - Think we can get her?<br> - I sent the script<br> to her agent, Sidney Loomis.<br> - You did?<br> - Did I do wrong? Did I do wrong?<br> - No, no.<br> - Did I do wrong not checking<br> with you first?<br> - Not at all.<br> - If so, I stand corrected. I mean that.<br> - No, really.<br> - Helen Sinclair... really.<br> - Get it out.<br> - She's great.<br> - Well, all we can do<br> is hope for the best.<br> You must be joking!<br> You want me to play some frumpy<br> housewife who gets dumped for a flapper?<br> Don't you remember who I am?<br> Don't you know who you represent?<br> - I'm Helen Sinclair!<br> - Definitely! You are<br> definitely Helen Sinclair.<br> I look at you and I say Helen Sinclair!<br> But who better to play that role?<br> - Under whose direction? Some novice!<br> - He's the author.<br> - Of two flops.<br> - Julian says it was the directors<br> that messed up those projects.<br> Julian Marx! I do plays put on<br> by Belasco or Sam Harris.<br> Not some Yiddish pants salesman<br> turned producer.<br> My ex-husband used to say,<br> "lf you're gonna go down,<br> go down with the best of them."<br> - Which ex-husband?<br> - Oh, I don't know which ex-husband.<br> The one with the moustache.<br> Listen to me. Authors are very often<br> the best directors of their own works.<br> She's dowdy! Sid, the ingenue<br> has all the hot lines.<br> Even the female psychiatrist<br> is a better role.<br> But the role of Sylvia Poston<br> is the lead.<br> Sylvia Poston.<br> Even the name reeks of Orbach's!<br> I do Electra!<br> I do Lady Macbeth!<br> I do plays by Noel and Phil Barry<br> or at least Max Anderson.<br> Helen, listen to me. This is<br> a major part in a serious play.<br> And let's face it, Helen. You have<br> not been in a hit in a long time.<br> - In a long, long, long time.<br> - I'm still a star!<br> I never play<br> frumps or virgins.<br> You're a star because you're great,<br> and you are a great star.<br> - But let me tell you somethin'.<br> - [ Bell Rings ]<br> In the last couple of years...<br> you're better known as an adulteress and<br> a drunk-- I say this in all due respect.<br> I haven't had a drink<br> since New Year's Eve.<br> - We're talkin' Chinese New Year's.<br> - Naturally.<br> Still, that's two days, Sid.<br> You know how long that is for me?<br> - What is it, Josette?<br> - [ Woman ] Some flowers.<br> Well, bring them here,<br> will you?<br> The offers are not pourin' in<br> like they used to.<br> They're from David Shayne.<br> "As a small artist to a greater one.<br> That you merely consider my play...<br> is all the fulfillment<br> I require.<br> Hmm.<br> - What's he like?<br> - I hear he's terrific.<br> A genius ready to emerge.<br> - I have to be billed over the title.<br> - Where else?<br> - Approval of the leading man.<br> The star's dressing room.<br> - This is not even a question.<br> Approval of<br> all photos of me.<br> Oh, it's still not<br> a very glamorous role.<br> But maybe I could meet with David.<br> Maybe we could go over the script.<br> Maybe there's a few ways<br> we could find to brighten her up. Hmm?<br> Why am I nervous?<br> - That was sad. Clara Bow had it rough.<br> - She's a doll.<br> - I'd do anything to be in a movie.<br> - You're pretty enough.<br> Do you think you could<br> ever speak to Mr. Valenti?<br> - Mr. Valenti knows everybody.<br> He'll do the right thing.<br> - That's right.<br> I hear he's gonna make Olive Neal<br> a Broadway star. [ Screams ]<br> [ Gunshots ]<br> Go, go, go!<br> Where'd it happen?<br> Who'd they get?<br> Oh, Jesus!<br> All right, I'm gonna be<br> at Olive's for about an hour.<br> You get some more guys downstairs<br> and call me back on the Masucci thing.<br> -This is for Leo Kustabeck, you hear me?<br> -[ Olive ] Hey!<br> - You said this was the lead.<br> It's a smaller part.<br> - All right.<br> - I got no time now.<br> - It's a smaller part.<br> I don't believe it.<br> - They just got Vinny and Sal<br> outside a movie house.<br> - I counted the lines.<br> - Sylvia Poston is the lead.<br> I'm just backing her up.<br> - You hear what I said?<br> - I'm tired of backing people up.<br> I wanna be the lead.<br> - Julian says you're a doctor.<br> - A doctor. I don't wanna be<br> a doctor. I wanna be the lead.<br> - A head doctor. It's a big part.<br> A head doctor,<br> but it ain't the lead.<br> - So don't try and snow me.<br> - You'd squawk if they<br> hung you with a new rope.<br> - I know a lead when I see a lead,<br> and this ain't the lead.<br> - [ Phone Ringing ]<br> - A lead is on every single page.<br> A lead has lots of scenes.<br> - Hello? Oh, Vito.<br> - Ya heard? Get everybody<br> together at the garage.<br> - I don't get to kiss nobody.<br> - No, I want it done today!<br> What is it with you?<br> - Hey!<br> - You wanna take your business<br> outta here?

Pick up quarters<br> off the tabletops with her--<br> - Hey! Butt out, why don't ya!<br> They're talkin' to me!<br> - I'm tryin' to break the ice.<br> - Who wants a drink?<br> - I'll have a double anything. Be great.<br> - [ Marx ] No, I have an ulcer.<br> - Venus, a double whiskey.<br> - Make it two, Venus.<br> - Do you want the blue<br> stuff or the green?<br> - The imported, dummy.<br> - Oh, you mean from the clean bathtub.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> - So you never acted before?<br> - Honey, honey. Yes, I have acted.<br> I have acted. I've acted a lot.<br> I was in a musical revue.<br> Can you light this for me?<br> Geez. No manners.<br> No gentleman.<br> Yeah, I did a musical revue<br> in Wichita.<br> Maybe you heard of it. It was called<br> Leave A Specimen. I had two songs.<br> - [ Phone Ringing ]<br> - Two numbers. Two thrilling,<br> show-stopping numbers.<br> I'm actually feeling<br> a little sick, really.<br> I'm actually feeling a little faint.<br> Can we sit down?<br> So, one thing I was wonderin'<br> is who's gonna be playing<br> the part of Sylvia Poston?<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Only Helen Sinclair.<br> Helen Sinclair? [ Laughs ]<br> I never heard of her.<br> - Uh, you follow the theater?<br> - What are you trying to insinuate?<br> Hey, don't<br> gimme that shit!<br> You tell Masucci he don't play<br> ball, I'll come down there,<br> I'll chop his fuckin' legs off!<br> Don't you pay any attention to Nick.<br> He's in one of his depressed moods.<br> I'll cut his throat. I'll come<br> down there, I'll pull his guts<br> out through his windpipe!<br> - Ya hear me?<br> - What'd ya do? Walk up?<br> - No!<br> - You're sweating like a pig.<br> - I have a bit of a blood sugar<br> situation now and again.<br> - Blood sugar?<br> - What is that?<br> - Olive, you-- you like the play?<br> - Mmm. It's sad.<br> - Well, it's a tragedy.<br> I'll say, but I got some ideas<br> how we can goose it up.<br> - Ideas?<br> - Mm-hmm. I go to<br> the movies all the time.<br> - I got a million clever ideas.<br> - You burn it down, Cheech!<br> Burn it down, I said.<br> - I want it to look like arson!<br> - I got a crick.<br> - When?<br> - A crick?<br> Everything's tight.<br> I think maybe we should go.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> Don't go.<br> Hey, Venus, let's go<br> with that hooch!<br> Uh, uh, Olive, when did you<br> get interested in acting?<br> Hey, listen, you think<br> I came to this town to swing<br> it around in a chorus line?<br> Tits and ass. Tits and ass.<br> That's all they care about. Thank you.<br> Hey, didn't I tell you<br> to make "horse durves"?<br> I don't make nothin' out of horses,<br> especially "horse durves..."<br> 'cause I don't know what<br> they are, and neither do you!<br> Oh, ain't you the big mouth<br> since you hit your number.<br> - And I said the imported stuff.<br> - The imported stuff ate through<br> the bottle. It's gone !<br> A likely story. It's very hard<br> to get good help these days.<br> - Sorry you guys had to hear that.<br> - I'm feeling fairly dizzy.<br> - Some problems with the firm.<br> - Really? What type of firm is it, Nick?<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - It's a "don't stick your nose in<br> other people's business...<br> - and it won't get broken type of firm.<br> - Yeah.<br> - [ Panting ] I see, I see. Thank you.<br> - That's what kind of firm.<br> I'm feeling a bit unstable.<br> I think maybe I'll go...<br> and check into a sanitarium<br> and get the help that I need.<br> - And we'll talk later because<br> it's been good. Hasn't it, Julian?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - It's been good.<br> - This is gonna be<br> a big event on Broadway.<br> - Thank you.<br> Absolutely not!<br> No!<br> - You'll work with her, mold her.<br> It'll be a challenge.<br> - Out of the question!<br> She'll win an award. It'll be a great<br> show business anecdote.<br> - It will not happen!<br> - A tribute to you as a director.<br> You use your actors like clay.<br> Julian, have you lost<br> all reason?<br> Do you believe that that woman<br> could play a psychiatrist?<br> That woman? That thing?<br> - Her voice, her grasp.<br> - All right.<br> - She's the woman who picks<br> quarters off tabletops with--<br> - Let me level with you.<br> This is a dog-eat-dog world,<br> not an ideal world.<br> If you wanna get your play on, you're<br> gonna have to make a few concessions.<br> Life is not perfect.<br> Plus, it is short.<br> If you can't figure that out,<br> you might as well pack up right<br> now and go back to Pittsburgh.<br> - [ David Screaming ]<br> I sold out! I sold out.<br> - [ Ellen Gasping ]<br> - I sold out.<br> - David.<br> [ Panting ]<br> - [ Gasps ]<br> - What's wrong?<br> - [ Screaming ] I'm a whore!<br> - Oh, my God!<br> - I'm a prostitute! I'm a whore!<br> - David, pull yourself together.<br> - They'll call the police.<br> - [ Panting ]<br> David. Oh, my God!<br> You look horrible.<br> Oh, I feel sick.<br> Please, you'll wake the Finkelsteins.<br> You want an aspirin?<br> - David. David.<br> - Oh, my God! My art! My work!<br> - What's wrong with you?<br> - Do I want success that badly?<br> - David. Come back to bed.<br> - The answer's yes. The answer's yes.<br> - Please come back to bed.<br> - When offered to have my play<br> backed by a hoodlum, I said yes.<br> - Please come back to bed.<br> - It's a deal with the devil,<br> and the penalty is...<br> - his girlfriend plays a part.<br> - Who are you calling at 3:00 a.m.?<br> [ David ] Hello, Julian? It's David.<br> Who do you see in the male lead?<br> Oh, kid.<br> [ Groans ]<br> It's 3:00 a.m.<br> - I see Warner Purcell.<br> - Nah, too fat.<br> You seen him lately?<br> Nah, the man's a compulsive eater.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> I talked to his agent...<br> and he's been on a new diet<br> for four months. He looks fine.<br> I want him for Lieutenant Masters.<br> Then maybe I can live with all this.<br> I can live with<br> these compromises.<br> I'll have Warner Purcell<br> and Helen Sinclair, and then<br> I can live with that gun moll!<br> No, not Warner, kid. No.<br> I had him in Nuns Aplenty.<br> He'll turn over a new leaf. Then he'll<br> get insecure; he'll start eating.<br> By the time we get to Boston, he'll be<br> as big as my sister-in-law's ass.<br> No! No more compromises!<br> It is my play, and I want him!<br> I want him, and I want him,<br> and that's it. I'm not a whore!<br> - David, David, David!<br> - [ Sighs ] I'm all right.<br> [ Nick ] Olive starts rehearsal<br> for a show next week.<br> - I want you to stay with her.<br> - [ Cheech ] Yeah.<br> I want you to make sure<br> they treat her right up there.<br> Those theater characters<br> I don't trust 'em.<br> The show's costing me a bundle,<br> and I'm gonna get my money's worth.<br> - She wants to be a star.<br> - Yeah. Yeah.<br> - And I promised her.<br> - Mr. V., look, it's not<br> that I don't wanna do it--<br> Cheech, I'm giving you<br> an order. What do you do?<br> I know.<br> [ David ]<br> Monday, September 10.<br> Today rehearsals began,<br> and I've decided to keep a journal.<br> Perhaps my experience<br> will be of value to others...<br> just as I pore over with relish<br> the notes of my idols:<br> Chekov and Strindberg.<br> Rehearsals began promptly<br> at 10:00 a.m.<br> Warner Purcell was first to arrive<br> full of bonhomie and good humor.<br> - Good morning!<br> - Warner Purcell.<br> Hello, I'm David Shayne.<br> - Oh, David, how marvelous<br> to meet you. Well done.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's a wonderful play.<br> Some lovely speeches.<br> - I'm honored you're doing it.<br> - It's my pleasure.<br> - Our stage manager, Mitch.<br> - Mitchell Sabine.<br> I'm here if you need anything.<br> - Mitchell, nice to meet you.<br> - That's fine.<br> - And you're gonna be<br> in dressing room two.<br> - Lovely.<br> - And this is my assistant, Lorna.<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> - Lorna, nice to meet you.<br> We have coffee and Danish,<br> some smoked salmon.<br> Um, Mitchell, would it be<br> frightfully tiresome if I just<br> had hot water and lemon?<br> - Not at all.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And of course you know Julian Marx.<br> - Oh, Julian, yes.<br> - Our swords have crossed.<br> - Warner, you look wonderful.<br> - And yourself.<br> - [ Woman Giggling ]<br> [ David ] Eden Brent, who plays<br> the other woman, arrived second.<br> She has<br> a wonderful vivacity.<br> [ Giggles ] Good morning! Good morning!<br> Don't get up. Don't get up.<br> - I have first-day-rehearsal<br> presents for everybody.<br> - How thoughtful.<br> It's nothing. Just some soap and some<br> potpourri and incense for you, I think.<br> - Now, have you met Mr. Woofles?<br> - No. No.<br> - Oh, don't pull such a sour face.<br> - Hello, Mr. Woofles.<br> Oh, be careful.<br> She's a Chihuahua...<br> but there's a pinch of Doberman in her<br> so sometimes she goes for your throat.<br> - Just kidding.<br> - [ Laughs ]<br> - I think you've met<br> everyone here. Lorna.<br> - We talked on the telephone.<br> I don't know if you've met<br> our Lieutenant Masters, Warner Purcell.<br> - Oh, pleased to meet you.<br> - How was your crossing?<br> - Well, I came over<br> five years ago, but it was lovely.<br> - [ Giggles ]<br> Now, my darling, do you want<br> some milk or something to eat?<br> - I'll get her a saucer.<br> - You don't have to bother with<br> that because I breast-feed her.<br> - Just kidding, everybody.<br> - [ Laughing ]<br> - Please.<br> - Julian, nice to see you.<br> - How are you?<br> - Mr. Marx.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> I'm in the middle, yes?<br> - [ David ] Should we take the dog--<br> - No, no, no, no, no.<br> It's my baby.<br> [ Giggles ]<br> [ David ] Olive Neal entered, naturally,<br> with the force of a hurricane.<br> - Hey, you gonna hover<br> over me like dead meat?<br> - Mr. V. says I stay close.<br> We've been drivin'<br> around for 15 minutes.<br> I told ya he said the Belasco,<br> not the Morosco, you cementhead!<br> - Hello, Olive.<br> - Hello.<br> - Everyone, this is Dr. Philips.<br> Olive Neal.<br> - Hi, nice to meet you.<br> - You know Julian.<br> - Yes.<br> - My assistant, Lorna.<br> - Hi.<br> - Eden Brent, Kristen.<br> - Ah, cute dog.<br> - Warner Purcell. Lieutenant Masters.<br> - Charmed, charmed, charmed.<br> - Stage manager Mitch.<br> - Mitch, hi, hi, hi, hi.<br> - And you are?<br> - I'm with her.<br> - He's with me. Yeah.<br> - Okay. Okay.<br> Well, um, we're just gonna<br> rehearse for a while, so--<br> Yeah.<br> Where she goes, I go.<br> All right, buster,<br> why don't you park yourself in<br> the back row of the theater...<br> and try not to snore.<br> Um, I--<br> - What?<br> - I don't like other people<br> watching rehearsals...<br> - generally as a rule because<br> the actors are very sensitive.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - I-I don't like--<br> - Hey, hey, who are you? Who are you?<br> - Whoa, whoa. Easy.<br> - I'm the director.<br> - Who is this?<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - I'm the director of the play.<br> - Wait a minute, Mr., uh--<br> - Cheech. The name's Cheech.<br> - Mr. Cheech, first of all--<br> - No, not Mr. Cheech. Ya hear me?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Cheech. Simple. Cheech.<br> - Cheech.<br> Now, why don't you just take a seat<br> in the back and we'll-- Yeah, go ahead.<br> - That's it.<br> - I find this very problematic.<br> - I'll be over there.<br> - He'll be unobtrusive, believe me.<br> He's not gonna bother anybody.<br> He just wants to watch.<br> He's my bodyguard.<br> [ Giggles ]<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> I'm usually highly professional.<br> - Oh, I'm sure.<br> - This is for you.<br> - Oh, talcum powder. My favorite.<br> - Thank you. You're a doll.<br> - Oh, no, you're a doll.<br> [ David ] Helen Sinclair came a half<br> hour late, but she had a good excuse.<br> Please forgive me.<br> My pedicurist had a stroke.<br> She fell forward onto the orange stick<br> and plunged it into my toe.<br> - It required bandaging.<br> - Oh, my poor darling.<br> Oh, it's so good<br> to see you.<br> - We all know and admire Helen Sinclair.<br> - [ Warner ] We're old friends.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> - Miss Sinclair, this is Mitch.<br> Oh, yes, yes. Oh, my goodness' sake.<br> I can't believe I'm here.<br> Oh-ho, look at this.<br> Look at this. Would you look?<br> Oh, this old theater.<br> This church.<br> So replete<br> with memories.<br> So full of ghosts.<br> Mrs. Alving.<br> Uncle Vanya.<br> There's Cordelia.<br> Here's Ophelia.<br> Clytemenstra!<br> Each performance<br> a birth.<br> Each curtain...<br> a death.<br> [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]<br> Was that a mutt?<br> [ Mitch ]<br> Yes, Miss Sinclair.<br> - I hate mutts!<br> - [ Barking Continues ]<br> [ David ] I didn't want to overwhelm<br> any of the actors on the first day...<br> so all we did<br> was read through the play.<br> I can't live<br> like this.<br> The same routine<br> over and over and over.<br> The days blend together<br> like melted celluloid.<br> Like a film whose images<br> become distorted and meaningless.<br> I want a divorce, Sylvia. I've said it<br> in a thousand subtle ways...<br> hoping you would realize,<br> but you refuse to see it.<br> As a little girl,<br> I swore one day...<br> I would have a necklace<br> made from the Milky Way.<br> Oh, Kristen, Kristen, if only humans<br> weren't cursed with the power of memory.<br> [ Olive Reading Flatly ]<br> Dreams are only disguised feelings.<br> The more we bring these<br> painful experiences to the fore...<br> the easier they become<br> to deal with.<br> - What's the "fore"?<br> - The fore. The foreground.<br> - [ Warner ] Is it-- Could I?<br> - [ David ] Please.<br> It's a golf term, when you yell, "fore"<br> when you're coming forward.<br> - [ Helen ] I didn't realize that.<br> - So you're telling me<br> she's talking about golf?<br> - Continue!<br> - What?<br> [ Helen ]<br> Oh, yes, okay. Doctor...<br> am I unattractive,<br> worn out?<br> Spent? Broken?<br> Desiccated? Old?<br> [ Olive ] Come, come, Mrs. Poston.<br> You're being mas--<br> - Mas--<br> - [ David ] Masochistic.<br> - Masochistic?<br> - Yes, masochism is someone<br> who enjoys pain.<br> - [ Warner ] As opposed to sadism.<br> - Enjoys pain?<br> What is she,<br> retarded?<br> - I don't fuckin' believe this!<br> - Continue.<br> [ David ] After the rehearsal,<br> I felt exhilarated.<br> Helen Sinclair suggested<br> we go for a drink to unwind.<br> She said she knew<br> of a little out-of-the-way<br> speakeasy where we could talk.<br> - It was wonderful to see old, uh--<br> - Wasn't it?<br> - Warner. Yes.<br> - Warner, yeah. He looks so slim.<br> - He's on a new diet.<br> - Who is she? Oh, I need a drink.<br> Olive. [ Chuckles ]<br> Yes. I'm sorry about Olive.<br> I do apologize.<br> We needed her to raise the money.<br> It must be difficult<br> getting a work like this on.<br> It's a sad reality<br> of the marketplace, I'll tell ya.<br> - We've never really<br> had a chance to talk.<br> - No.<br> - Hi, folks. What can I get you?<br> - Two martinis, please, very dry.<br> - How'd you know what I drank?<br> - Oh, you want one too?<br> - Three.<br> - Three martinis.<br> Uh, I can't judge my own writing,<br> but I must say...<br> that just from today's reading,<br> I can tell how brilliant<br> you're going to be in this role.<br> - It's a wonderful play.<br> - Thank you.<br> No, no, I mean it. It's so rare<br> that anything is really about something.<br> You know-- Well, there's Max Anderson<br> and Gene O'Neill.<br> - That's about it.<br> - You just named my two living gods.<br> I was a little reluctant at first<br> to play the part.<br> The character is so--<br> She's so, um... uh, colorless.<br> Colorless, yes.<br> Well, that's the idea--<br> - Then I realized what<br> you were going for.<br> - You did?<br> How profound, how complex,<br> her inner life really is.<br> I tried to give her<br> some contradictions.<br> I was worried.<br> I'm used to playing<br> more overtly heroic women.<br> Less tentative.<br> More alluring.<br> Certainly not<br> frigid.<br> No, yes, yes. Well, Sylvia Poston<br> is a mass of neuroses.<br> In spite of the fact that I<br> could really find nothing at all<br> in the play to brighten her up...<br> - no real passion, no seductiveness...<br> - Nothing?<br> I still think that<br> she's worth playing.<br> We could work it over, and<br> a touch here or there could be<br> changed to make sure you're...<br> - No, no, no, no.<br> I wouldn't dream of you...<br> - comfortable.<br> changing a word<br> of your work for me.<br> God, who am l, some<br> vain Broadway legend?<br> You... you're<br> a budding Chekhov.<br> I'm not saying I'll distort the play.<br> I'm just saying I'll reread it<br> with that in mind.<br> I mean, after all, Miss Sinclair--<br> Helen. May I call you Helen?<br> - Yes.<br> - Helen...<br> your instincts as an actress<br> are impeccable.<br> And I want the character<br> to have dimension. I don't mean<br> for her to be a drone.<br> - You see through me, don't you?<br> - Me?<br> You're clever.<br> You're brilliant.<br> What insight<br> into women.<br> Don't deny it.<br> I don't see why<br> she has to be frigid.<br> [ Nick ] Hey, how ya doin', doll?<br> How'd it go?<br> [ Olive ] Ah, they're all<br> so stuck up.<br> - Yeah? Anybody botherin' her?<br> - No.<br> They expect me to memorize<br> all these lines.<br> - Well, that's what you wanted,<br> isn't it? To be an actress?<br> - I know, I know, I know.<br> - I got a headache.<br> - Cheech'll help you<br> practice after we eat.<br> - Me?<br> - The girl's got stuff<br> to memorize, all right?<br> - Yeah, but, Nick--<br> - Go sit in the tub, honey. Go ahead.<br> I'm takin' you out to Delmonico's.<br> You want sirloin or a lobster?<br> - One of each.<br> - Listen, Nick, I'm not too good<br> at this memorizing, and I got a date--<br> All right, all right, knock it off.<br> I got a little errand for you to run.<br> - What kind of errand?<br> - A message for Charlie Masucci,<br> and we ain't got a lot of time.<br> ##<br> Up a lazy river<br> where the old mill run<br> Meets lazy, lazy river<br> in the noonday sun<br> Linger in the shade<br> of a kind old tree<br> Throw away your troubles<br> Dream a dream--<br> - Up a lazy river<br> where the robin's song<br> - [ Water Splashing ]<br> Awakes a bright<br> new morning--<br> Can't you see...<br> you're living out<br> the exact same pattern...<br> your mother lived out<br> with your father?<br> I am?<br> Pray tell.<br> In some way,<br> you're trying to relive it,<br> and in the process<br> of reliving it, correct it.<br> As if that were possible.<br> Ha!<br> -It don't say "Ha."<br> -I know it don't say "Ha." I added that.<br> - What do ya mean you added that?<br> Are you allowed to do that?<br> - We're allowed to add things.<br> - How could you add something?<br> You can't do that.<br> - You're allowed!<br> - It's called ad-libbing.<br> - You can't do that!<br> I can do that. What do you know? You<br> don't know nothin'. Shut up and read.<br> - I think the whole thing stinks.<br> - I think you're a degenerate<br> zombie. Shut up and read!<br> - You better shut up! Just shut up!<br> - You shut up and read.<br> - You shut up!<br> - You're lucky you're Nick's girl.<br> You're lucky<br> you're an idiot.<br> What endeavors you...<br> to concoct a theory so tenuous?<br> Mmm-mmm-mm.<br> I sure pities the poor folks who gonna<br> have to pay to see this play.<br> - What ya thinking?<br> - Oh, just about Eugene O'Neill<br> and Max Anderson, you know.<br> Yeah. You've been rewriting all night<br> and it's only just the first day.<br> - Is that a bad sign?<br> - No. I just think that<br> I might have made...<br> the character of Sylvia Poston<br> a bit too antiseptic.<br> - She's gotta have a sexual side to her.<br> - No.<br> - I think she's the best female<br> character you've written in a long time.<br> - Says who?<br> David, you know you always have<br> problems getting into the female mind.<br> - I know that you think that.<br> - You've said so yourself before.<br> We've had this discussion.<br> All your friends are men. You-- You've<br> always had problems writing for women.<br> Witness your relationship<br> with your mother, your grandmother...<br> - your two aunts, your sister--<br> - I think I try to factor that<br> into my work.<br> But to be honest with you...<br> at this moment, I don't think<br> you really understand my work at all.<br> - Oh! Don't be so defensive.<br> - I'm not being defensive.<br> Perhaps my opinions just aren't<br> intellectual enough for you.<br> Maybe they're just not--<br> That's a horrible thing to say.<br> When you have a good idea,<br> I listen to it. I'm responsive.<br> - In this case, I think you're<br> wrong. That's about it.<br> - When am I right?<br> You're right about other things, but not<br> about Sylvia Poston and her sexuality.<br> [ David ] September 17.<br> The first week is behind me now...<br> and apart from a few minor incidents,<br> things seemed to go okay.<br> There was that moment<br> between Helen and Eden.<br> I can't do that speech if she's<br> going to be fidgeting around upstage!<br> - Well, that's why I think<br> I should sit. I'll sit.<br> - Oh, God!<br> Sylvia would never ask her to sit<br> in her own house. She despises her!<br> She doesn't want me to sit. She doesn't<br> want me to stand. I guess I could squat.<br> David, do you realize you're asking an<br> audience to believe that my husband...<br> would leave me<br> for this woman?<br> - Come along.<br> - Excuse me. Excuse me, but<br> I think it's made very clear...<br> in the speech about erotic attraction,<br> why he does that.<br> You fool! He's thinking of me<br> when he does that speech.<br> Don't you know anything?<br> - Only the part about the liver spots.<br> - Listen.<br> How long has it been since<br> you've had a real hemorrhage?<br> David, I wonder if now would be a moment<br> to do my soliloquy from Act II?<br> - [ Crying ] Did you hear what she--<br> - Please. Aspirin!<br> [ David ] All right, yes, why don't we?<br> And, Eden, just take five.<br> - I need an aspirin!<br> - [ Crying Continues ]<br> [ David ]<br> Mitch.<br> [ David ] Then there was the time when<br> I tried to cut one of Olive's speeches.<br> - I like that speech,<br> and I already got it memorized.<br> - But it's superfluous.<br> - It's-- What is it?<br> - Well, I've overwritten it.<br> We know how you feel<br> about Sylvia's breakdown when<br> you talk with the good doctor.<br> So it's my fault.<br> Um, the performance is fine.<br> But, um...<br> I like to say it.<br> - We-- We don't need it.<br> - Hey!<br> Are you tryin' to make<br> my part smaller?<br> - No, no, every--<br> - My part's small enough as it is!<br> Every play needs some cuts, and the size<br> of the role is not the important thing.<br> Did you hear what she said? She doesn't<br> want her speech taken away from her!<br> - Look, look, Mr. Cheech, I've about--<br> - I'd rather be shootin' crap myself...<br> but Mr. V. told me that she's gotta<br> be up there a lot!<br> - I wrote this play,<br> and I'm directing this play!<br> - I don't care.<br> You wanna get slapped here or do<br> you want me to take you outside<br> and we'll straighten this out?<br> It's up to you.<br> [ David ] Warner Purcell remains<br> good-spirited and a joy to work with.<br> And what discipline. Although,<br> I notice he no longer has just<br> a cup of hot water and lemon.<br> [ Eden ] lf you start it off<br> at that level--<br> Well, what are we going to do<br> about that canine-loving ingenue?<br> - Did you cast her because<br> you thought she was attractive?<br> - She's pretty...<br> but more importantly, she has a certain<br> perkiness that the character requires.<br> She's perky. She makes you<br> wanna sneak up behind her with<br> a pillow and suffocate her.<br> - It's a beautiful apartment.<br> - Josette.<br> - My beaker of martinis.<br> - Your taste is exquisite.<br> My taste is superb.<br> My eyes are exquisite.<br> What justifiable confidence.<br> - I think at some point you're<br> going to have to fire Olive.<br> - I'm afraid that's not possible.<br> Oh, how can you take her butchering<br> your poetry? I know I couldn't stand it.<br> No one in his right mind is<br> going to believe she's a doctor,<br> not even a veterinarian.<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - I understand, but it's a compromise<br> I have to live with...<br> and if I want the play to open,<br> I have to find a way to live with it.<br> I plan on reducing the scope of her role<br> if her bodyguard will let me.<br> Can you believe<br> that character?<br> Imagine, traveling with<br> your own private Neanderthal.<br> - I wasn't aware that you opened<br> The Master Builder.<br> - Oh, well.<br> I had forgotten that<br> you won that drama award.<br> - Here's to your play.<br> - Oh, thank you. Our play.<br> To an ideal world<br> with no compromise.<br> Oh, my gosh,<br> look at this view!<br> A million blinking lights.<br> A million broken hearts.<br> - You know what's down there?<br> - What?<br> - Broadway.<br> - Ah. That's your street.<br> Mm-hmm. Yes, that's my street,<br> but I'd like to give it to you.<br> - That is, if you want it.<br> - Who wouldn't want it?<br> I want you to write a play for me.<br> Oh, I mean when all this is over.<br> - Really?<br> - Your next play, I want you to create<br> a vehicle for Helen Sinclair.<br> - I'm honored.<br> - But it must have size...<br> an important woman.<br> - A Borgia. A Curie. You name it.<br> - Yes!<br> - I'll dedicate myself to it.<br> - Oh, and while you're at it...<br> if you could just have<br> a look at that scene in Act ll.<br> If she succeeds in seducing<br> the Lieutenant instead of<br> being rejected a second time...<br> - it could add some variation<br> to the character.<br> - Yes, that's a wonderful idea.<br> The heart is "labyrinthinine..."<br> a maze beset with brutal pitfalls<br> and mean obstacles.<br> David, I can't say that line. It doesn't<br> make sense. It's stupid. I don't get it.<br> - It's just a stylish way<br> of expressing a particular idea.<br> - Idea? What idea?<br> The agony of love.<br> The difficulty of relating.<br> - Why do you have to make it<br> so hard to say?<br> - Just say the line.<br> - No, I can't say it.<br> It's a mouthful of "ghibberish."<br> - Gibberish!<br> - I can't say it, and I will not say it.<br> - Just do the line.<br> No! I'm not making<br> a fool of myself.<br> [ Cheech ]<br> She's right, it stinks.<br> Oh-ho, Jesus,<br> another party heard from.<br> It's a stupid way of talkin',<br> and nobody talks like that.<br> - I don't believe this is happening.<br> - Frankenstein is right.<br> When I want your opinion,<br> I will ask for it.<br> I can't stand to listen to this<br> garbage. Every day I sit back there...<br> and I hear the same bullshit<br> over and over again.<br> Then leave.<br> No one asked you here.<br> [ Helen ]<br> Oh, David, take it easy.<br> Where did you study play writing?<br> Was it Sing Sing?<br> "A maze beset<br> by brutal pitfalls--"<br> Hey, Olive, I memorized it,<br> and I'm tellin' ya...<br> it comes to me all the time,<br> and it stinks on fuckin' hot ice!<br> - That's it. I quit. This is crazy.<br> - [ Warner ] David.<br> - Oh, please, I have a little hangover!<br> - I am famished.<br> Everyone, everyone,<br> why don't we take lunch? An hour?<br> - [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]<br> - You don't wanna<br> say the goddamned line...<br> - don't say the goddamned line!<br> - Oh, look at you, Mr. Temperamental.<br> [ Helen ] lf that rat on a leash<br> barks one more time--<br> -He sounds melancholy. Is he melancholy?<br> -You can trim the line.<br> - Because she can't handle it?<br> - Because you said yourself<br> you were having trouble with it.<br> - So you agree with the gorilla?<br> - David, for Christ sake! It's one line!<br> - It's not going to wreck the scene.<br> - That's not the point!<br> Suddenly I'm taking suggestions from a<br> strong-arm man with an I.Q. of minus 50.<br> I've had it!<br> - David, for goodness' sake. Come on.<br> - Look who's here.<br> Oh, God!<br> Get my rifle!<br> I guess I'm just hypersensitive because<br> maybe deep down, I agree with the goon.<br> - Maybe it is a turgid line.<br> I don't know. My nerves are shot.<br> - No. Just calm yourself.<br> Helen, the play is not working.<br> It's not working, and it's in my<br> writing. It's not just Olive.<br> That's the reason we have rehearsal.<br> That's the reason we go out of town.<br> You have such a wonderful attitude.<br> I'm so lucky.<br> The best part of this project every day<br> is that I get to come to work...<br> and see you and be with you<br> and work with you.<br> - I don't mean to spoil the day.<br> - Then let's not.<br> Sit down here.<br> I'm going to show you something.<br> Okay.<br> This is my favorite spot<br> in the park.<br> And in winter,<br> when it's covered with snow...<br> at about 4:30 in the afternoon,<br> when it's just getting dark<br> and the lights come on...<br> it's all misty.<br> And you can just see the silhouettes of<br> the Manhattan skyline through the trees.<br> And it's magical.<br> It's magical.<br> Helen, I think I'm falling<br> in love with you.<br> Don't.<br> - I don't know if I can help it.<br> - David, please, we must be strong.<br> I've kept a check on my feelings<br> for so long, but there's<br> so much that I want to say.<br> - What are words?<br> - Oh, gosh.<br> David, everything meaningful<br> is in some unexplainable form.<br> It's-- It's more primordial<br> than mere language.<br> - I'm not sure I follow that one.<br> - Oh, be silent.<br> - Be silent.<br> - Helen--<br> No, let's just sit here<br> holding our thoughts.<br> Not revealing them.<br> Be still.<br> Let the birds have their song.<br> Let ours for now remain unsung.<br> You're amazing.<br> [ "Ain't Misbehavin"' ]<br> Stop it.<br> Stop it.<br> - I'm not in the mood!<br> - What do you mean<br> you're not in the mood?<br> Honey, you better get in the mood,<br> 'cause he's payin' the rent.<br> Shut up, Venus!<br> Just what I said: I'm not in the mood.<br> - Do I have to be in the mood<br> every time you are?<br> - Stop puttin' on the airs.<br> - I'm not puttin' on airs.<br> - I never knew you when you wasn't<br> ready for a little action.<br> Well, today, I'm not ready for action.<br> I'm tired. Rehearsal is hard.<br> - Get your motor goin'.<br> - No!<br> - Hey, I brought you somethin'.<br> - What?<br> - Huh?<br> - Hmm.<br> What do ya say?<br> Come on.<br> - Nickie.<br> - Oh, I got a great bottle<br> of French wine.<br> Joey Foster<br> made it himself.<br> Pasadena. I'm pooped.<br> Let's misbehave<br> There's something wild<br> about you, child--<br> [ David ] Today, Ellen came<br> to watch rehearsal.<br> She was very excited to meet the cast,<br> especially Warner Purcell.<br> - Warner, Warner, Warner.<br> This is Ellen. My girlfriend.<br> - Oh! Pleased to meet you.<br> - You should be very proud.<br> He has a rare talent.<br> - Yes, he does.<br> [ David ] The morning proceeded<br> very smoothly for the first half hour.<br> And then<br> another incident occurred.<br> The heart obeys<br> its own rules. Ha!<br> As a doctor, your respect for<br> rationalities is not very profound.<br> - David, I-- David, can I--<br> - [ David ] Yes?<br> I don't understand the character here.<br> Suddenly, she's too wise.<br> And, David, I don't know why she's<br> telling her to dump her fiance.<br> - She's caught up with the Lieutenant.<br> - The Lieutenant?<br> But it's as if she's just mouthing<br> the playwright's philosophy.<br> - Why would she just up and leave Tom?<br> - Because she's impulsive.<br> - It doesn't feel right.<br> - Well, yeah, and I don't<br> understand, you know...<br> if I'm a doctor, how come<br> I'm giving her such bad advice?<br> - It's not bad advice.<br> - It is bad advice.<br> But, David, you see, in Act I,<br> she says that Tom changed her life.<br> - Yes, but she's recklessly<br> driven to the Lieutenant.<br> - It doesn't make sense.<br> - Just give it a chance.<br> - There's something<br> contradictory about it.<br> - Just give it a chance.<br> - It's just bad writing.<br> [ Cheech ]<br> I'll tell ya what's wrong.<br> - Oh, Christ! Julian?<br> - Now let's wait a minute.<br> - Let's not get into a situation here.<br> - She shouldn't leave the guy.<br> She should stick with him.<br> Then when the Lieutenant has<br> that fight with his wife and<br> walks out, he should notice her.<br> That way,<br> it won't be boring.<br> Somebody say something!<br> - I think it's a good idea.<br> - [ Julian ] It's not a bad one.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - Oh, no.<br> It's, uh--<br> It really isn't.<br> [ Warner ] Personally, I like it.<br> I think it's very dramatic.<br> Ellen, do you see what I'm up against?<br> Do you see what I have to put up with?<br> - I think he has an interesting concept.<br> - What?<br> Not to say that--<br> - She doesn't leave the Lieutenant.<br> - Right.<br> - She doesn't leave her fiance.<br> - Right.<br> We lose that scene, and suddenly<br> a lot of good possibilities open up.<br> - [ Cheech ] It's a helluva lot<br> better than what you got.<br> - I actually like it.<br> - You're taking his side?<br> - It's not a question of sides.<br> - David, she's right.<br> The play always bogged down there.<br> - Try it.<br> - That's why the actors<br> always looked so uncomfortable.<br> - I can't make those changes.<br> - Why not? H-H-How do they meet again?<br> - Because the--<br> The Lieutenant notices her, right?<br> And then, he goes after her.<br> I mean, that's the way<br> it would happen in real life.<br> He goes after her. Come on.<br> You can't force it, kid. I mean, if it's<br> meant to go in a whole other direction--<br> - I quit!<br> - Oh, don't be so egotistical.<br> - I'm outta here.<br> - Egotistical? Why?<br> Because I protect my play?<br> - Protect it against what? A good idea?<br> - Oh, thank you for the support.<br> - No, no, I quit! That's it. Good-bye.<br> - I'm gonna go shoot crap.<br> - That's it. I quit.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> [ Julian ]<br> David. David!<br> - I'm gonna go shoot crap.<br> - David.<br> - [ Mr. Woofles Barking ]<br> - Mommy's coming.<br> If an artist can, it gives us all a<br> much better chance, and he is an artist.<br> - Is that why he's getting all hot<br> and bothered all the time?<br> - Artists are very emotional.<br> - Artists are emotional, are they?<br> - Yes, they are.<br> Hey, I've been meaning<br> to ask ya...<br> is it my imagination<br> or are you always... Iookin' my way?<br> - You're a very observant girl.<br> Yes, I have been looking at you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yeah, well, I notice somethin'.<br> I notice you have...<br> a really<br> big appetite.<br> - Yes, I do have a big appetite.<br> - Yeah, I noticed that, but--<br> - Where's your baby-sitter?<br> - What, Cheech?<br> - Yes.<br> - Ah, you don't have to worry<br> about Cheech. He took off.<br> - Did he?<br> - A minute there's a chance,<br> he runs off to play craps.<br> - Takes about two hours.<br> - Well, listen, now that<br> you've been let off the leash...<br> - Yeah?<br> - why don't we go in...<br> - and get to know each other<br> a bit better?<br> - Okay.<br> That might be pleasant.<br> [ Giggles ]<br> - [ Giggles ]<br> - Well.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi.<br> - You're a very attr--<br> Wait just a minute.<br> - What? What? What?<br> - Before we start--<br> - Yeah?<br> - What? Oh.<br> - Just a--<br> A little poultry.<br> [ Giggles ]<br> Okay.<br> - All right. Let's go.<br> - All right.<br> You do have a big appetite.<br> [ Giggles ]<br> - Pull yourself together.<br> So he came up with a good idea.<br> - [ Sighs ]<br> - Helen, not you too?<br> - If you did follow his suggestion...<br> you'd be able to put in that new scene<br> in Act Ill that you've always wanted to.<br> - Yes, but it'd--<br> - And that, that casts<br> a whole new light...<br> on my relationship<br> with my husband. Yes!<br> So you're saying<br> you want me to change it?<br> At the risk of seeing you<br> upset on your birthday.<br> - How did you know it was my birthday?<br> - Happy birthday.<br> - Helen! Ohh.<br> - Open it.<br> Gosh!<br> Oh, gosh.<br> Really. It's--<br> Don't get too excited.<br> I didn't buy it.<br> Cole Porter gave it to me.<br> It's one of many.<br> - Now I'm gonna have to take up smoking.<br> - Hmm.<br> Have a good time tonight<br> with your girlfriend.<br> I'm sure she's taking you out.<br> - Yes, with the Marxes.<br> - Yes, well... make a birthday wish.<br> - I have.<br> - I hope you get everything<br> in life that you want.<br> Helen, have you thought<br> about what I said before...<br> - about the way I feel?<br> - Don't speak.<br> - But I want to express--<br> - Don't speak. Don't.<br> - Just a few things I want to tell you.<br> - Don't speak.<br> - When we first met-- [ Muffled ]<br> - No, no. Don't speak.<br> Please don't speak.<br> Please don't speak.<br> No! No!<br> No! Go!<br> Go, gentle Scorpio, go!<br> Your Pisces wishes you<br> every happy return.<br> - Just one--<br> - Don't speak!<br> ##<br> - [ Sighs ]<br> - Wow, a wallet!<br> - That's appropriate.<br> - It was the nicest one I saw by far.<br> - The piping. That's real leather.<br> - Places to put stuff in there.<br> - You like it?<br> - It's amazing. Beautiful.<br> - You like it?<br> - Yes, really.<br> - Now all I need is some money,<br> and it'll hold its shape.<br> - You will prosper, my friend.<br> - I promise. [ Chuckles ]<br> Am I right, Hilda?<br> - No, I love it.<br> - Can I pick 'em or can I pick 'em?<br> - Oh, you sure can, Julian.<br> - Happy birthday.<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> Thanks for spending it with me.<br> - Oh, it's wonderful.<br> - Hilda, touch glasses there.<br> Hey, look who's here<br> with his girlfriend.<br> - [ Ellen ] Oh, no.<br> - I owe that big Gorgonzola an apology.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Now that he's drunk, he's gonna<br> apologize to everyone. Strangers.<br> [ David ] Today at rehearsal,<br> he came up with that little<br> suggestion, and I overreacted.<br> I let my ego get in the way of the work,<br> and I feel I owe him an apology.<br> - Ah, you're all right.<br> You handled it very well.<br> - I'll be right back.<br> I take it all back. It was a good<br> suggestion, and I apologize.<br> - Say hello to Violet.<br> - Hi, Violet.<br> - Hi, nice to meet you.<br> Who's this, Cheech?<br> - He's a writer.<br> - I'm a struggling writer.<br> - You wanna know what the problem<br> with your story is?<br> - What's the problem?<br> Are you gonna do some more rewrites?<br> - Sit down. Take a load off your feet.<br> - Moe, go on. Come here. Get him a beer.<br> - Why not?<br> - [ Violet ] He's a writer?<br> - Yeah.<br> - I didn't know you knew writers.<br> - Do me a favor. Shut up.<br> Don't tell me<br> to shut up.<br> All right,<br> number one.<br> See, I don't believe she loves<br> the guy right from the start.<br> She's too on, uh, top of him<br> all the time. That's not love.<br> That's like keeping somebody in prison.<br> But if you changed it, right?<br> And she left him,<br> then she would feel so bad about it...<br> - that she would have the<br> nervous breakdown and go nuts.<br> - [ Music Stops, Applause ]<br> - How ya doin', Cheech?<br> - Tulio, listen, I gotta see you later.<br> - I wanna get down on the Cardinals<br> for the doubleheader, all right?<br> - You got it.<br> - Them birds look good.<br> - Teach your friend some manners<br> and get him outta here.<br> - All right, so--<br> - You were-- You were talking about--<br> Right, all right.<br> So, now...<br> if the doctor feels what Sylvia's<br> feelin'-- That's her name, Sylvia.<br> - There's a Sylvia in my neighborhood.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> -Yeah. What was her name? Sylvia Pincus.<br> -Sylvia Pincus.<br> Sylvia Pincus. Big, fat Jewish broad,<br> had a little tiny husband.<br> She chopped him up with an ax and mailed<br> his pieces all over the country.<br> I don't know what<br> she was tryin' to prove.<br> That's disgusting. You gotta<br> tell that story in front of me?<br> - Relax.<br> - You know I got a weak stomach.<br> - You were tellin' me<br> about the play a minute ago.<br> - Don't interrupt me.<br> - You were sayin' about Sylvia?<br> - Right. So if the doctor feels<br> what Sylvia's feelin'--<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - Know what I mean?<br> Yeah. She identifies<br> with her patient, a bit.<br> Right. This way when she gets jealous,<br> it makes sense.<br> - Right.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> There's gotta be a time when the<br> Lieutenant has it out with the doctor.<br> Why isn't that in there?<br> You're talking about a whole<br> different direction for the play.<br> Definitely.<br> Think about it.<br> How would the audience know<br> Sylvia was feeling guilty? lf--<br> Oh. I don't know.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Yeah. Wait.<br> You could work it out with maybe you--<br> you hear what she's thinkin'.<br> -You mean she speaks her thoughts aloud?<br> -Sure, why not? It's a play anyhow.<br> It don't have to be real,<br> but it'll be stronger.<br> You think about that.<br> And you, don't interrupt me no more.<br> I'm sorry.<br> So how come you had so much<br> to say to that Valenti goon?<br> No, nothing. I was just<br> thanking him for his ideas.<br> - What ideas? He only had<br> the one suggestion, didn't he?<br> - Yeah.<br> - That was just it.<br> - So do you like your wallet?<br> - What?<br> - The wallet.<br> - Oh, yes, yes, it's terrific.<br> - Are you sure?<br> Oh, it's very exciting. I love<br> leatherette. Always have loved it.<br> Boy, are you loaded.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Happy birthday.<br> Thanks.<br> [ David ] September 24. I gave the cast<br> the rewrites. Everyone seemed pleased.<br> - [ Helen ] These are brilliant! Oh!<br> - [ Warner ] They are.<br> Now Sylvia's<br> not so passive.<br> She uses her wiles to trap<br> the Lieutenant, and that's<br> what causes her guilt!<br> [ Warner ] The whole thing is motivated.<br> It drives on. Wonderful.<br> - [ Olive ] You mean I gotta<br> memorize all new lines?<br> - [ Helen ] They're wonderful!<br> - How did you come up<br> with such divine changes?<br> - They're not really mine--<br> - Oh, no? Whose are they, God's?<br> - [ Laughing ]<br> - Well, they are mine<br> in the sense that they're mine--<br> - Your modesty becomes you.<br> But let's face it;<br> you are a major talent.<br> A major new voice<br> in the theater.<br> The word genius gets thrown around<br> so frequently in this business...<br> - but, darling, if the shoe fits--<br> - Congratulations.<br> - It finally has balls.<br> - Now, if we can do something<br> about Act Ill...<br> we got a big, fat hit<br> on our hands.<br> - [ Warner ] Three cheers<br> for the writer! Hip-hip--<br> - [ Cast ] Hooray!<br> [ David ] I stayed up all night<br> working on the third act.<br> I admit it came rather hard...<br> and before I handed in the pages,<br> I sent them over to Cheech to read.<br> He suggested I come down<br> to his office.<br> - You missed the idea.<br> - I did?<br> Yeah, you did.<br> Plus, nobody talks like that.<br> - You got that problem.<br> You don't write like people talk.<br> - I take poetic license.<br> Poetic license, bullshit.<br> People believe what they see<br> when the actors sound real.<br> - Come here. Let me show you.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - What does it look like I'm doin'?<br> - You're gonna write it?<br> What am l? A fuckin' idiot?<br> They taught me how to write in<br> school before I burned it down.<br> - You burned down your school?<br> - Yeah, it was Lincoln's birthday.<br> There was nobody there.<br> - If you actually write--<br> - Look, I know how people talk,<br> all right?<br> Go shoot a rack,<br> and let me do this.<br> But if you actually write it,<br> then I'm not--<br> - Don't worry about it.<br> I ain't gonna tell anybody.<br> - No?<br> No. I saw you playin' the big shot.<br> I know what it's all about.<br> Where I come from,<br> nobody squeals.<br> Go shoot a rack.<br> Stop starin' at me.<br> [ Helen ] What dialogue!<br> This is better than O'Neill!<br> Max Anderson<br> will never touch you!<br> So you liked it.<br> It's so full of passion!<br> It's so full of life!<br> - I hoped it would lift the story.<br> - What a difference between this<br> and your first draft.<br> You hadn't found yourself yet. The idea<br> was there, but it hadn't crystallized.<br> You needed to hear it<br> on its feet, and now this.<br> It's no longer tepid<br> and cerebral.<br> It's full of life!<br> It's full of passion!<br> It reeks with humid sexuality!<br> It's carnivorous at last!<br> - You thought my first draft<br> was cerebral and tepid?<br> - Only the plot and dialogue.<br> - But this--<br> - Was-Was-Was there nothing<br> in the original draft...<br> that you feel<br> is worth saving?<br> The stage directions were lucid.<br> Best I've ever seen.<br> - And the color of the binder.<br> Good choice.<br> - Thank you.<br> I always had a flare<br> for stage directions.<br> I went back and reread your<br> earlier plays. They suffered<br> from the same problem.<br> - [ Sighs ]<br> - Good ideas, but<br> too contrived, no real guts.<br> It's like you<br> finally happened.<br> - Helen, I have a confession to make.<br> - Yes?<br> [ Inhales Deeply ]<br> - I--<br> - Don't speak!<br> No, no, don't speak.<br> I know you wanna deprecate yourself.<br> I know you do, but you're<br> going to take this town by storm.<br> I didn't...<br> realize what<br> an inspiration...<br> you've been<br> to my writing.<br> Oh, David.<br> Dear, dear David.<br> Pungent,<br> seething artist.<br> The cocoon<br> has opened.<br> I would give my body freely to<br> the man who wrote those words.<br> Those glorious,<br> powerful words.<br> - Helen--<br> - No, don't speak.<br> - [ Mumbling ]<br> - Don't speak. Don't speak.<br> No. Silence. Silence.<br> - Don't speak.<br> - [ Mumbles ] Please.<br> [ David ] September 28.<br> The play is working much better now.<br> Helen has been getting on more<br> pleasantly with Eden, and I<br> believe she likes Mr. Woofles.<br> - [ Barking ]<br> - Back! Back! Back! Back!<br> [ David ] Warner Purcell and Olive seem<br> to always be exchanging coy glances.<br> I don't know if it's my imagination, but<br> he seems to have put on a little weight.<br> Perhaps the tension of our<br> upcoming Boston opening has<br> caused him to cheat on his diet.<br> [ David ] Can we go<br> from "God of our fathers"?<br> Take it from<br> "God of our fathers."<br> [ Ellen ] Oh! God of our fathers,<br> help me!

I read every book.<br> Let me tell you about teachers.<br> I hate teachers.<br> Those blue-haired bitches used to<br> whack us with rulers. Forget teachers.<br> - There was a boy I knew when I was<br> growing up, and he played accordion.<br> - Yeah?<br> I loved accordion. And I practiced<br> and practiced, and I got fluent.<br> Yet he would squeeze one single note,<br> and the sound of it would make you cry.<br> -I used to want to dance. You know that?<br> -Make you cry.<br> - I mean it.<br> You ever see George Raft dance?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - So--<br> - What?<br> Mr. Marx says that you, uh, actually<br> rubbed a few people out.

Mr. Purcell,<br> you have been stealing our<br> dog yummies and eating them.<br> Absolutely not.<br> That's an outrageous suggestion.<br> - Then let me see in your pockets.<br> - Would I eat dog food?<br> You'd eat anything that didn't eat<br> you first, you big fat pot of helium.<br> - This is the sort of food I eat:<br> prime loin chop.<br> - Let me see.<br> I do not steal from animals.

Please, please!<br> I don't need to hear any more.<br> But he's a major talent.
