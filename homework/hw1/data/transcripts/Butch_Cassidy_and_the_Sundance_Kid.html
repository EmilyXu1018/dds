                        Good night, Pat.<br> Good night.<br> What happened to the old<br> bank? It was beautiful.<br> People kept robbing it.<br> That's a small price to pay for beauty.<br> Hit me.<br> Again.<br> Bust!<br> Give me credit, Mr. Macon?<br> You know my rules, Tom.<br> Well, it looks like you just about<br> cleaned everybody out, fella.<br> You haven't lost a hand<br> since you got the deal.<br> What's the secret of your success?<br> Prayer.<br> Let's just you and me play.<br> Hit it.<br> Bust.<br> Yeah, you're a hell of<br> a card player, fella.<br> I know, 'cause I'm a<br> hell of a card player,<br> and I can't even spot<br> how you're cheating.<br> The money stays, and you go.<br> Well, we seem to be<br> a little short on brotherly love<br> around here.<br> If you're with him, you<br> better get out of here.<br> We're on our way.<br> I wasn't cheating.<br> Come on.<br> I wasn't cheating!<br> You can die. You can both die.<br> You hear that?<br> If he invites us to stay, then we'll go.<br> He's got to invite us to stick around.<br> He'll draw on you.<br> You don't know how fast he is.<br> I'm over the hill, but<br> it can happen to you.<br> That's just what I want to hear.<br> Every day you get older. That's a law.<br> What would you think about<br> maybe asking us to stick around?<br> What?<br> You don't have to mean it or anything.<br> Just ask us to stick<br> around. I promise...<br> I can't help you, Sundance.<br> I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid<br> when I said you were cheating.<br> I draw on you, you'll kill me.<br> There's that possibility.<br> You'd be killing yourself.<br> Why don't you just<br> invite us to stick around?<br> You can do it...<br> and easy.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Why don't you stick around?<br> Thanks, but we got to get going.<br> Hey, Kid.<br> Hey, Kid, how good are you?<br> Like I been telling you...<br> over the hill.<br> Boy, you know,<br> every time I see<br> Hole-In-The-Wall,<br> it's like seeing it for the first time.<br> Every time, I ask myself<br> the same question...<br> how can I be so damn<br> stupid to keep coming back?<br> What's your idea this time?<br> Bolivia.<br> What's Bolivia?<br> Bolivia... that's a country, stupid.<br> Central or South America.<br> One or the other.<br> Let's go to Mexico instead.<br> All they got in Mexico is sweat.<br> There's too much of that here.<br> If we'd been in business<br> during the California gold rush,<br> where would we have<br> gone? California, right?<br> When I say Bolivia, you<br> just think California.<br> You wouldn't believe<br> what they're finding<br> in the ground down there.<br> They're just falling into it.<br> Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.<br> Payrolls so heavy we'd strain<br> ourselves stealing them.<br> You just keep thinking, Butch.<br> That's what you're good at.<br> Boy, I got vision,<br> and the rest of the<br> world wears bifocals.<br> Hi, News. What you doing?<br> Aw, howdy, Butch. Uh, nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> Howdy, Sundance.<br> You sure are. You're<br> doing something. What?<br> Just fixing to rob the<br> Union Pacific Flyer, Butch,<br> like what we had in mind.<br> You fellas got everything<br> I told you all wrong.<br> Sure, we might hit the Flyer,<br> but even if we do, it won't be this run.<br> It'll be the next one, the return.<br> Sundance and me, we<br> been checking the banks.<br> No banks.<br> What?<br> The Flyer, Butch.<br> Fellas, bad as they are,<br> banks are better than trains.<br> They don't move. They stay put.<br> You know the money's in there.<br> When I left, I gave orders.<br> New orders been given.<br> I run things here, Harvey.<br> Used to you did.<br> Me now.<br> This don't concern you.<br> You tell him to stay out.<br> Well, he goes his own way, like always.<br> What's the matter with you guys?<br> When I came here,<br> you were nothing. I formed you.<br> Who says?<br> Read them a clipping, News.<br> Which one?<br> Any of them.<br> This one here's from Salt Lake Herald.<br> Butch Cassidy's<br> Hole-In-The-Wall Gang... <br> That's me!<br> You want Harvey to do your planning?<br> Want him to do your thinking for you?<br> You want him to run things?<br> Shut up now, News.<br> Not till I get to the good part.<br> Also known to have<br> participated in the holdup<br> are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver.<br> I just love to read my<br> name in the paper, Butch.<br> So we just forget<br> about Logan taking over,<br> O.K., Flat Nose?<br> You always said<br> that any one of us could challenge you.<br> 'Cause I figured no one would do it.<br> Figured wrong, Butch.<br> You guys can't want Logan!<br> At least he's with us.<br> You been spending a lot of time gone.<br> Well, that's because<br> everything's different now.<br> Guns or knives, Butch?<br> You got to plan more, prepare more.<br> Guns or knives?<br> Neither.<br> Pick!<br> I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.<br> Anything you say, Butch.<br> Maybe there's a way to<br> make a profit in this.<br> Bet on Logan.<br> I would, but who'd bet on you?<br> Sundance...<br> when we're done and he's dead,<br> you're welcome to stay.<br> I don't mean to be a sore loser,<br> but when it's done,<br> if I'm dead, kill him.<br> Love to.<br> No, no. Not yet.<br> Not until me and Harvey<br> get the rules straightened out.<br> Rules in a knife fight?<br> No rules.<br> If there ain't any<br> rules, let's get started.<br> Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.<br> I was really rooting for you, Butch.<br> Well, thank you, Flat Nose.<br> That's what sustained<br> me in my time of trouble.<br> Hey, what's this about the Flyer?<br> Harvey said we'd hit it<br> both this run and the return.<br> Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.<br> No matter how much we got at first,<br> they'd figure the return was safe<br> and load it up with money.<br> Harvey thought of that?<br> Yes, sir, he did.<br> I'll tell you something, fellas.<br> That's exactly what we're going to do.<br> Stop it.<br> Where?<br> Up ahead there.<br> Bet that's old Butch himself.<br> Hold it there.<br> Just thought I'd watch.<br> Bring the kids, why don't you?<br> Stick your heads in.<br> You're just going to<br> get yourself blown up<br> you don't open that door.<br> I can't do that. I work<br> for Mr. E.H. Harriman<br> of the Union Pacific Railroad. He...<br> Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff<br> and open up.<br> What's going on?<br> We got a patriot in there.<br> That's young Woodcock.<br> He's awful dedicated.<br> Woodcock?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You know who we are?<br> You're the Hole-In-The-Wall<br> Gang, Mr. Cassidy.<br> I understand that,<br> but Mr. E.H. Harriman<br> himself give me this job.<br> I got to do my best.<br> Your best don't include<br> getting yourself killed.<br> Dynamite's ready.<br> Mr. E.H. Harriman himself<br> had the confidence...<br> Open the door, or that's it.<br> You think E.H. Harriman<br> would get himself killed for you,<br> Woodcock?<br> I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman<br> of the Union Pacific Railroad,<br> and he entrusted me...<br> Hey, Woodcock.<br> Woodcock, you all right?<br> Hey.<br> Hmm?<br> Whatever Harriman's<br> paying you ain't enough.<br> There ain't what I'd call<br> a fortune in there, Butch.<br> Well, just so we come out ahead.<br> That's the main thing.<br> The<br> Hole-In-The-Wall Gang<br> The<br> Hole-In-The-Wall Gang<br> just robbed the Flyer<br> right outside of our town,<br> so that makes it our responsibility<br> to get out there and get after them.<br> You'll have to bring your own horses.<br> How many of you can bring your own guns?<br> How many of you will want<br> me to supply you with guns?<br> Well... come on now.<br> I think it's up to us to<br> do something, don't you?<br> What's the point?<br> They're probably halfway<br> to Hole-In-The-Wall<br> already.<br> That's exactly why we have got to hurry.<br> If we mount up right now<br> and get out there after them,<br> maybe we can head them off.<br> If we did that, they'd kill us.<br> We don't want to let<br> them get away with this.<br> Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon.<br> All right, youse two,<br> I want you at my party.<br> What party?<br> I'm losing my piano player.<br> He's going off to fight the war.<br> What war?<br> The war with the Spanish.<br> Remember the Maine.<br> Who can forget it?<br> I'm giving him a send-off. so come on.<br> Goodbye, Dolly<br> I must leave you...<br> When I was a kid,<br> I always thought I would grow up<br> to be a hero.<br> It's too late now.<br> Why'd you say something like that?<br> You didn't have to say<br> something like that.<br> You want me to go alone<br> and fight the<br> Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?<br> That's fine with me.<br> If you want your kids<br> to know you let me,<br> that's fine with me,<br> but I don't think that's what you want.<br> Is it?<br> Why don't we enlist,<br> go fight the Spanish?<br> You and me in the war.<br> We got a lot of things going for us...<br> experience, maturity, leadership.<br> I'll bet we end up officers.<br> I'd be Major Parker.<br> Parker?<br> Yeah. That's my real name.<br> Robert Leroy Parker.<br> No fooling?<br> No.<br> Mine's Longbaugh.<br> No fooling.<br> Long what?<br> Harry Longbaugh.<br> So you'd be Major Longbaugh.<br> What do you say?<br> You just keep thinking, Butch.<br> That's what you're good at.<br> But you're not frightened.<br> No, sir.<br> You have got respect for me,<br> and I have got respect for you.<br> That's why you and you and you<br> are riding with me. Am I right?<br> Well, what do you say?<br> I say this.<br> I say, ladies and gentlemen,<br> boys and girls, friends and enemies,<br> meet the future!<br> The future what?<br> The future mode of transportation<br> for this weary Western world.<br> Now, I'm not going to make<br> a lot of extravagant claims.<br> Sure, it'll change your<br> whole life for the better,<br> but that's all.<br> What the hell do you think you're doing?<br> You got the crowd together,<br> so I thought I'd do a little selling.<br> I'm trying to raise a posse here.<br> A short presentation.<br> The horse is dead.<br> This item sells itself.<br> Are you going to listen<br> to him or come with me?<br> Butch, Fanny says to come into her party<br> right now.<br> No oats, no mess, no kicks, no bites,<br> no running away, no<br> stepping on your foot.<br> Well, I think I'll get saddled up<br> and go looking for a woman.<br> Good hunting.<br> Shouldn't take more<br> than a couple of days.<br> I'm not picky...<br> as long as she's smart,<br> pretty...<br> sweet...<br> gentle, and...<br> tender and refined...<br> lovely...<br> carefree.<br> Aah!<br> Keep going, teacher lady.<br> It's O.K. Don't mind me. Keep on going.<br> Let down your hair.<br> Shake your head.<br> Do you know what I wish?<br> That once you'd get here on time.<br> You are mine, Etta Place.<br> Mine.<br> You hear me?<br> Mine.<br> All mine.<br> Your soft white flesh is mine.<br> Soft...<br> white...<br> bwhaa!<br> Meet the future.<br> Do you know what you're doing?<br> Theoretically.<br> Aah!<br> Don't ever hit your mother with a shovel<br> It leaves a dull impression on her mind<br> Raindrops keep fallin' on my head<br> And just like the guy<br> Whose feet are too big for his bed<br> Nothin' seems to fit<br> Those raindrops are fallin' on my head<br> They keep fallin'<br> So I just did me some talkin' to the sun<br> And I said I didn't like<br> the way he got things done<br> Sleepin' on the job<br> Those raindrops are fallin' on my head<br> They keep fallin'<br> But there's one thing<br> I know<br> The blues they sent to meet me<br> Won't defeat me<br> It won't be long<br> Till happiness<br> Steps up to greet me<br> Raindrops keep fallin' on my head<br> But that doesn't mean<br> My eyes will soon be turnin' red<br> Cryin's not for me<br> 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain<br> By complainin'<br> Because I'm free<br> Nothin's worryin' me<br> Raindrops are fallin' on my head<br> But that doesn't mean<br> My eyes will soon be turnin' red<br> Cryin's not for me<br> 'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain<br> By complainin'<br> Because I'm free<br> Nothin's worryin' me<br> You've come to get him for the Flyer?<br> Would you believe I'm broke already?<br> Why is there never any money, Butch?<br> I swear, Etta, I don't know.<br> I've been working<br> like a dog all my life,<br> and I can't get a penny ahead.<br> Sundance says it's<br> because you're a soft touch<br> and always taking expensive vacations,<br> buying drinks for everyone,<br> and you're a rotten gambler.<br> That might have something to do with it.<br> Butch.<br> Hmm?<br> Do you ever wonder if I'd met you first<br> we'd been the ones to get involved?<br> We are involved, Etta.<br> Don't you know that?<br> You are riding on my bicycle.<br> In some Arabian countries,<br> that's the same as being married.<br> Hey.<br> What are you doing?<br> Stealing your woman.<br> Take her.<br> Take her.<br> Well, you're a romantic bastard.<br> I'll give you that.<br> I'll give you that.<br> O.K., open up in there.<br> I work for Mr. E.H.

Let go!<br> What are you going to do to her?<br> Well, leave her alone.<br> You're after the money,<br> and the money's in here.<br> Please! All I want<br> is for somebody to start this train.<br> Somebody, please!<br> Open the door, Woodcock,<br> or tell her goodbye.<br> Our Father, who art in heaven,<br> hallowed be Thy name,<br> Thy kingdom come,<br> Thy will be done,<br> on earth as it is in heaven.<br> What am I going to<br> tell poor Mr. Harriman?<br> Woodcock, what'd you have to go and do<br> something like that for?<br> Well, Butch, you blew<br> the last one so easy,<br> I just had to, um, do something.<br> Give me that and get some more,<br> a lot more!<br> Well, that ought to do it.<br> Think you used enough<br> dynamite there, Butch?<br> Ha ha ha ha.<br> What the hell is that?<br> Whatever they're<br> selling, I don't want it.<br> Will you leave it?<br> Come on!<br> Hyah!<br> Hey, Butch!<br> What?<br> They're very good!<br> Split up!<br> How many of'em are following us?<br> All of'em.<br> All of'em?<br> What's the matter with those guys?<br> Hyah!<br> I think we lost 'em.

Top of the stairs.<br> Hey, you realize you're driving me crazy<br> staring out the window like that?<br> I swear, Sweetface can handle it, easy.<br> He wouldn't dare louse me up.<br> He's that scared of me.<br> Hey, kid, how can I give Agnes<br> the concentration she deserves<br> with you staring out<br> the window like that?<br> Butch, you're really something,<br> you know that?<br> Could you be a little more specific<br> about that, Agnes?<br> Butch!<br> O.K., Sweetface, give them a nice smile.<br> Come on.<br> That's a nice touch.<br> I swear, if he told me<br> I rode out of town 10 minutes ago,<br> I'd believe him.<br> And there they go.<br> No, no.<br> Don't ask me to stay.<br> You're the only real man I ever met.<br> You know that, Butch?<br> It's not just 'cause of all that money<br> you got to spend on people. It's you.<br> The way you're always<br> looking to see am I happy or not?<br> A lot of the other girls,<br> they... they might want you<br> for when you got lots of money<br> to spend on people.<br> Me, I... I don't care about...<br> clothes and money and jewels...<br> and furs,<br> and things like that.<br> Lots of the other girls do,<br> but I never did.<br> I always said, Agnes... <br> Don't move.<br> Stand up.<br> Put your hands up.<br> Higher.<br> Now turn around and start...<br> Get our horses and come on back here.<br> Hyah!<br> Get out of here!<br> Get out!<br> Go on!<br> Get out of here, you fat-headed beast!<br> Come on!<br> You're the fat-headed<br> beast. Quit shouting!<br> Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.<br> Which way?<br> Well, it doesn't matter.<br> I don't know where we've been,<br> and I've just been there.<br> They can't follow us. We're safe.<br> You really think so?<br> I will if you will.<br> How long you<br> figure we've been watching?<br> Oh, a while.<br> How long before you figure<br> they're not after us?<br> A while longer.<br> How come you're so talkative?<br> Just naturally blabby, I guess.<br> Ohh! I haven't done so much riding<br> since I quit rustling.<br> That's a miserable occupation.<br> Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.<br> Hey.<br> I see it.<br> Torches you think?<br> Yeah, maybe.<br> Maybe lanterns.<br> They're following our path.<br> Dead on it.<br> I couldn't do that. Could you do that?<br> How can they do that?<br> Who are those guys?<br> You sure this'll work?<br> It'll work.<br> That's what you said about Sweetface.<br> This'll work.<br> Once they divide up,<br> we take them, no trouble, right?<br> Maybe.<br> Boy, for a gunman,<br> you're one hell of a pessimist.<br> They ought to get<br> to where we split up any time.<br> They're just about there.<br> How many of them do you<br> think will come our way?<br> Oh, I wish we had rifles.<br> I mean, they got rifles.<br> But we got surprise on our side, right?<br> So far, they're doing what we want.<br> You think we ought to<br> take them from up here?<br> Kid, look, you know this<br> work better than I do.<br> Is it best here,<br> or maybe down there,<br> closer to the trail?<br> Uh...<br> Damn it!<br> They're not going for it.<br> Who are those guys?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> We got to do something and shake them.<br> Whatever you come up with<br> is fine with me,<br> but whatever it is, it better be now!<br> What are you doing here?<br> Easy, Ray. Easy.<br> What the hell do you mean, take it easy?<br> You promised you'd never<br> come into my territory.<br> And we haven't.<br> Just because we were friendly<br> doesn't give you the right to break in.<br> What if we was seen together?<br> I'm too old to find another job.<br> At least have the<br> decency to draw your guns.<br> Listen, Butch is trying<br> to tell you something.<br> All right. What do you want?<br> A couple of things.<br> We want to enlist, Ray.<br> In the army. Right away.<br> Go fight the Spanish.<br> Oh, you're crazy. You are crazy.<br> You are, both of you, crazy!<br> They'd throw you in jail<br> for a thousand years each.<br> Come on, Sundance.<br> Start trussing my feet.<br> Here. You seen these before. Come on!<br> I'm not taking the chance<br> that someone saw you coming in.<br> We're serious about this.<br> You are known outlaws.<br> We'd quit.<br> That's the point. Is that on tight?<br> That's all right.<br> There's some hankies in the drawer<br> you can use to gag me.<br> I swear, this'd work, Ray.<br> You trust us. The government trusts you.<br> Anything you tell them<br> they gotta believe, right?<br> You've never done a<br> dishonest thing ever,<br> and you're pushing 60. We'd quit.<br> They'd drop the charges against us,<br> we'd fight till the war is over.<br> They don't even have<br> to make us officers.<br> That's some proposition.<br> They forget all about the years<br> of thieving and robbing.<br> They take you into the army,<br> which is what you want<br> in the first place.<br> There's something out there<br> that scares you, huh?<br> But it's too late.<br> You should've let yourself get killed<br> while you had the chance.<br> You may be the biggest<br> thing to hit this area,<br> but you're still two-bit outlaws.<br> I never met a soul more<br> affable than you, Butch,<br> or faster than the Kid.<br> But you're still two-bit outlaws<br> on the dodge.<br> It's over! Don't you get that?<br> Your times is over,<br> and you're gonna die bloody,<br> and all you can do is choose where.<br> I'm sorry,<br> I'm getting mean in my old age.<br> Come on. Shut me up, Sundance.<br> Ah, you're wasting your time.<br> They can't track us over rock.<br> Tell them that.<br> They're beginning to get on my nerves.<br> Who are those guys?<br> You remember the time<br> you, me, and Etta went to Denver<br> for a vacation?<br> I'm glad you brought that up, Kid.<br> That's an important topic,<br> considering our situation.<br> The night we went gambling, remember?<br> We had dinner at the hotel.<br> Etta had roast beef, and I had chicken.<br> If I can remember what you had,<br> I'll die happy.<br> Look out there.<br> What?<br> I got to talking to<br> some gambler that night.<br> He told us about an Indian...<br> full-blooded Indian,<br> except he used an English name,<br> Sir... somebody.<br> Lord Baltimore?<br> That's right, and he could track anybody<br> over anything day or night.<br> So?<br> The guy on the ground, I think it's him.<br> No. Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.<br> He's strictly an Oklahoma man.<br> I don't know where we are,<br> but it isn't Oklahoma.<br> Ah, it couldn't be him.<br> It couldn't be him.<br> I guess.<br> Whoever it is,<br> it sure the hell is somebody.<br> Damn it!<br> Don't they get tired?<br> Don't they get hungry?<br> They've gotta be.<br> Why don't they slow up?<br> They could even go faster.<br> At least that'd be a change.<br> They don't even break formation.<br> Do something!<br> Kid.<br> What?<br> Who's the best lawman?<br> Best? How?<br> You mean toughest or easiest to bribe?<br> Toughest.<br> Joe LeFors.<br> Gotta be.<br> LeFors never leaves Wyoming. Never.<br> You know that.<br> He always wears a white skimmer.<br> That's how you tell it's Joe LeFors,<br> 'cause he wears a white straw hat.<br> Look at that guy out front.<br> Jesus, who are those guys?<br> Hyah!<br> Come on now.<br> Here you go, Kid.<br> Go on! Get out of here! Go on!<br> What if they don't follow the horse?<br> You're the brains, Butch.<br> You'll think of something.<br> Damn it!<br> The way I figure it,<br> we can either fight or give.<br> If we give, we go to jail.<br> I've been there already.<br> If we fight,<br> they can stay where they are<br> and starve us out...<br> or go for position, shoot us.<br> Might even get a rock slide started.<br> What else can they do?<br> They could surrender to us,<br> but I wouldn't count on that.<br> They're going for position, all right.<br> Better get ready.<br> Kid, the next time I say<br> let's go someplace like Bolivia,<br> let's go someplace like Bolivia.<br> Next time.<br> Ready?<br> No. We'll jump.<br> Like hell we will.<br> No. It'll be O.K.<br> if the water's deep enough<br> and we don't get squished to death.<br> They'll never follow us.<br> How do you know?<br> Would you jump that<br> if you didn't have to?<br> I have to, and I'm not gonna.<br> We got to. Otherwise we're dead.<br> Come on.<br> Just one clear shot...<br> that's all I want.<br> I want to fight them!<br> They'll kill us.<br> Maybe.<br> You want to die?<br> Do you?<br> All right, I'll jump first.<br> No.<br> Then you jump first.<br> No, I said.<br> What's the matter?<br> I can't swim!<br> Why, you crazy?<br> The fall will probably kill you.<br> Oh-oh...<br> ohhh...<br> shiiiit!<br> Hang on to me.<br> You're drowning me!<br> I can't help it. I can't swim.<br> You're choking me!<br> I can't swim!<br> I'm telling you, if I drown,<br> I swear to God I'll kill you.<br> Never said I was a great swimmer.<br> Oh! You're choking me!<br> Oh! I'm choking!<br> Let go of me.<br> I'm choking!<br> Let go of my throat.<br> The papers said they had you.<br> Was it LeFors? Did they say?<br> Joe LeFors?<br> I think so.<br> And their tracker?<br> Tracker?<br> Was it Lord Baltimore?<br> I think so.<br> The paper's inside.<br> You got enough to feed us?<br> Don't you know I do?<br> They said you were dead.<br> Don't make a big thing out of it.<br> No. Make a big thing out of it.<br> Hey.<br> It was Baltimore and LeFors.<br> You know who else?<br> Who?<br> Jeff Carr, George Hiatt...<br> Hiatt?<br> T.T. Kelliher.<br> We lucked out getting away.<br> You know that?<br> Why would these guys join up<br> and take after us, though?<br> Forget it. Bunch like that<br> won't stay together long.<br> They will...<br> if Mr. Harriman has his way.<br> Who?<br> Mr. E.H. Harriman<br> of the Union Pacific Railroad.<br> He resents the way you've<br> been picking on him,<br> so he's outfitted a special train<br> and hired special employees.<br> You've been avoiding them for two days.<br> It's really sort of flattering<br> if you want to think about it that way.<br> A setup like that costs more<br> than we ever took.<br> Apparently he can afford it.<br> That crazy Harriman.<br> That's bad business.<br> How long do you think<br> I'd stay in operation<br> if every job cost me money?<br> If he'd just pay me what he's spending<br> to make me stop robbing him,<br> I'd stop robbing him.<br> You probably inherited<br> every penny you got!<br> Inherited guys,<br> what the hell do they know?<br> You say they were hired permanent?<br> No. Just till they kill you.<br> That means they're<br> still after us, Butch,<br> and it's going to be the same thing<br> all over again.<br> They'll show up here...<br> sooner or later.<br> Hey, Etta.<br> I'll get you some more.<br> Butch and me have been<br> talking it all over.<br> Wherever the hell Bolivia is,<br> that's where we're off to.<br> We'll go down there and play it safe,<br> maybe keep our hand in a little bit.<br> Butch speaks some Spanish.<br> I can wrestle with a menu O.K.<br> And you speak it good.<br> And it'd be good cover<br> going with a woman.<br> No one expects it.<br> Then we could travel safer.<br> What I'm saying is,<br> if you want to go,<br> I won't stop you,<br> but the minute you start to whine<br> or make a nuisance,<br> I don't care where we are,<br> I'm dumping you flat.<br> Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.<br> Tell her straight.<br> I'm 26, and I'm single<br> and a schoolteacher,<br> and that's the bottom of the pit.<br> And the only excitement I've known<br> is here with me now.<br> So I'll go with you,<br> and I won't whine,<br> and I'll sew your socks,<br> and I'll stitch you when you're wounded,<br> and I'll do anything you ask of me<br> except one thing.<br> I won't watch you die.<br> I'll miss that scene,<br> if you don't mind.<br> The future's all yours,<br> you lousy bicycles.<br> Well, you know, it could be worse.<br> You get a lot more for<br> your money in Bolivia.<br> I checked on it.<br> What could they have here<br> that you could possibly want to buy?<br> Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.<br> How do you know?<br> This might be the garden spot<br> of the whole country.<br> People may travel hundreds of miles<br> just to get to this spot<br> where we're standing now.<br> This might be the<br> Atlantic City, New Jersey,<br> of all Bolivia for all you know.<br> I know more about Bolivia<br> than you know about<br> Atlantic City, New Jersey,<br> I can tell you that.<br> Aha!<br> You do, huh?<br> I was born there.<br> I was born in New Jersey...<br> brought up there, so...<br> I didn't know that.<br> The total tonnage of what you don't know<br> is enough to shatter...<br> We're not accomplishing<br> as much as we might.<br> Listen, your job is to back me up,<br> because you'd starve without me.<br> And you, your job is to shut up.<br> He'll feel a lot better<br> after he's robbed a couple of banks.<br> Ha ha ha ha!<br> Bolivia.<br> Hell, it's just a bank<br> like any other bank.<br> You got to move in slowly,<br> check out everything.<br> The thing to remember...<br> Don't tell me how to rob a bank.<br> I know how to rob a bank.<br> A few dark clouds<br> appear on your horizon,<br> and you just go all<br> to pieces, don't you?<br> Buenos das, seores.<br> Les puedo servir en algo?<br> Ordenen para atenderlos<br> por favor inmediatamente.<br> Quieren hacer algn depsito?<br> Quieren abrir una cuenta?<br> Bien, el cajero los<br> atienda inmediatamente.<br> Los atendemos por todo.<br> Seor?<br> Adis.<br> This is a robbery.<br> Esto es un robo.<br> Esto es un robo.<br> This is supposed to<br> be a unison recitation.<br> Why do I have to do any of this?<br> He's the one<br> who claimed he knew the language.<br> Your line of work requires<br> a specialized vocabulary.<br> I got nervous.
