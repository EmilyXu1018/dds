                        Pile out, you tramps.<br> It's the end of the line.<br> Grab your last look at free side, kid.<br> - Hi, Emma.<br> - Hi.<br> Shut up!<br> Line up by twos.<br> Take them to the receiving room,<br> Cassie. You know the way blindfolded.<br> Heard you was falling back in.<br> Still got you scrubbing,<br> Meta? Give me some skin!<br> No guy's given me a tumble in months.<br> Shut up!<br> The lists are alphabetical. Marie Allen.<br> Court says you're married. Legitimate?<br> All valuables must be turned over<br> to us until you hit free side.<br> Wedding ring, too.<br> Some county-jail gum heels<br> must have been here first.<br> Do they still soak you a fiver<br> for a phone call or a visitor?<br> Sign this. I'll fill it in later.<br> Mother living? Father? Any brothers? Sisters?<br> Well, there's just my<br> mother. She got married again.<br> Nothing like this has ever<br> happened to anybody in the family.<br> No previous criminal record.<br> In case of death, who do we notify?<br> Death? Oh, Mom, I guess.<br> Belong to any church?<br> We used to go. It's a church on State Street.<br> I forget its name. I think...<br> Armed robbery, huh? For one to 15 years.<br> The judge called me an accessory.<br> I've got to get to your<br> version of the crime, so shoot.<br> Well, we'd only been<br> married a couple of months.<br> We tried to find a place to live,<br> but everything costs so much,<br> so Mom let us move in<br> with her and my stepfather.<br> Well, Tom was always fighting<br> with Gus. That's my stepfather.<br> He tried to find a better<br> job, and then he got fired.<br> Get to the crime.<br> When Tom drove into that gas station,<br> I stayed in the car while he...<br> Then the attendant hit Tom over the<br> head, and I went out to help him.<br> I guess that's why they<br> called me an accessory.<br> They took back the $40.<br> Five bucks less, and it wouldn't be a felony.<br> Don't try to kid me. How old are you really?<br> Nineteen.<br> Sign this. I'll skip the mental<br> test. You look normal enough.<br> Lots of them haven't all their marbles.<br> You can take your physical.<br> - Where?<br> - The infirmary. Your number's 93850.<br> No, 93850. Remember it.<br> The infirmary's at the end of<br> the corridor. Follow your nose.<br> Next, Emma Barber. Snap into it.<br> Say, you got real skinny, didn't you?<br> I hope your batch is<br> cleaner than the last lot.<br> I had to scrub them with brooms.<br> Eyes okay.<br> No drugs in the ears. Open your mouth wide.<br> I said, wide.<br> No drugs in the mouth. Teeth sound.<br> Lung tap sound.<br> Heart excited but strong enough.<br> What's the matter?<br> I feel a little sick.<br> Get that way often?<br> Yes, the last week or so.<br> Say, you expecting company?<br> I don't know.<br> Another pregnant one. Get up.<br> You know who the father is?<br> My husband.<br> Well, ain't we getting respectable?<br> Could he help with the expenses?<br> He's dead.<br> Another bill for the State. Get dressed.<br> Shall I put down "pregnant"?<br> No, better wait. See what the doc says.<br> That trained seal sure<br> can ask a lot of questions.<br> Who's this Pearl Harbor,<br> anyway? Is she an inmate?<br> - Shut up, Emma, and strip.<br> - Oh, goodie.<br> Never mind the glamour, puss.<br> Couldn't I have a comb?<br> What's the difference?<br> There's no men in here.<br> Can I write a letter to my mother?<br> No, not while you're in isolation.<br> You gotta stay here until<br> your blood test comes back,<br> so for two weeks, there'll be<br> no mail, no visitors, no nothing.<br> Welcome to Lysol Lane.<br> Did you just get in today?<br> I'm on the last lap.<br> Ten to 20. They had to put me in here.<br> No beds in the infirmary.<br> I'm sick.<br> I got it bad.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> You better not stay too<br> close to the bed, sister.<br> It's just the break you get.<br> Sometimes you get a matron who's a louse.<br> Sometimes you get a good egg.<br> I'd walk a mile for a<br> cigarette if they'd let me.<br> I was just thinking.<br> Quit bragging!<br> It's all the judge's fault I'm here.<br> When Joe first beats me up, I grab his<br> gun and just wing him in the shoulder.<br> Do they arrest me? No!<br> Then a year later, I fires<br> at Joe again and miss.<br> Do they give me a rap<br> for attempted assault? No!<br> Then last year, I defends<br> myself again with a gun,<br> and the police still treats<br> me like I was poison ivy.<br> And then finally I finish Joe off for good.<br> Well, it's that judge. If he had nabbed me<br> the first three times<br> while I was just practicing,<br> I wouldn't be here now for murder.<br> It's all the judge's fault.<br> Read it and weep.<br> Rubbing it in because we're behind the iron.<br> Heads or tails, you lose.<br> You girls are moving along today.<br> Marie Allen, I've got news<br> for you from the infirmary.<br> Your blood came back okay. No treatment.<br> Now, the Superintendent will see you first,<br> and Doc says you're two months on the way.<br> That's swell, honey.<br> I got a grownup son older than you.<br> It's funny. You get a baby from a guy, and<br> then 20 years later, you finish him off.<br> Hello, Ann. Well, it's good to see you.<br> How are things up front?<br> Busy. Who's first?<br> Marie Allen.<br> Good luck, kid. Be seeing you.<br> It's tough at first. I know.<br> I've been through the mill.<br> Been here eight years.<br> Kept my nose clean, and Mrs. Benton<br> let me help her in the office.<br> Having a regular job like that<br> certainly makes you feel good<br> after working in the bakery for five years.<br> What are you in for?<br> Murder.<br> Come in. Sit down here, please.<br> Don't be frightened.<br> I want you to know that<br> we're all here to help you.<br> I want you to believe that I'd like<br> to be your friend if you'll let me.<br> What is it? What's troubling you, Marie?<br> I have been so lonely the last two weeks.<br> Those other women, the way they<br> talked and the awful things they said<br> and those matrons, always<br> watching, never leaving you alone.<br> You'll find all kinds of women in<br> here, just as you would outside,<br> but every large institution must have rules,<br> and the matrons are here to<br> see that the rules are obeyed.<br> You weren't sent here to be punished.<br> Just being here is the<br> punishment. That's all.<br> You know, first offenders like you,<br> Marie, are our greatest concern.<br> Unfortunately, they have to be<br> crowded in with more experienced women<br> simply because we haven't more space,<br> and you'll be with such women.<br> Of course, I want you to have friends.<br> All of us need an outlet for affection,<br> but no prison is a normal place.<br> How soon can I go home?<br> If your record is good, you can<br> come up for parole in 10 months.<br> But I'm going to have a baby.<br> Do I have to have it in here?<br> I know how you feel, Marie,<br> but the inmates aren't allowed<br> to go home to have their babies.<br> Don't worry.<br> Any blood relative can take care<br> of your child until you get out.<br> Then my mother will take care of it.<br> But they wouldn't let me<br> write her. Can I write her now?<br> Of course, now that we're sure<br> that your relatives actually exist.<br> That's because some of the inmates<br> change their criminal contacts<br> into kindhearted uncles and cousins<br> and sometimes even sick grandmothers.<br> I know how strange all this is<br> to you, but you were sent here<br> because you were involved in a serious crime.<br> We want to help you so that when you go home,<br> you can start a new life.<br> I want to do the right thing.<br> You're an intelligent girl.<br> You know good from bad.<br> Try to keep busy. It's important.<br> Now, as to your work,<br> I'll bet you helped your mother with<br> your father's shirts, didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> Well, we'll put you in<br> the laundry as a checker.<br> It will be easier for<br> you because of the baby.<br> You can see me anytime.<br> Hi, Ann.<br> Hello, Harper.<br> Since you went fancy working upstairs<br> for Benton, I kind of missed you.<br> This is Marie Allen. Mrs. Benton<br> says to put her in laundry.<br> Marie's gonna have a baby.<br> A baby, huh?<br> Why, you're just a kid yourself.<br> - So long, Marie.<br> - Goodbye, Ann. Thank you.<br> Let's you and me get acquainted, honey.<br> You may be a number to<br> the others but not to me.<br> Sit down in this chair. It's kind of roomy.<br> You like the stuff in here, huh?<br> Just little presents from my<br> girls for taking good care of them.<br> - Caramel?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Cigarette?<br> You know, you're gonna find out<br> that a lot of things<br> are tough to get in here.<br> This is just a little<br> personal service of my own.<br> On the side, sort of. Understand?<br> I like to do a good turn for my girls.<br> Why, sometimes, on my night off,<br> I drop in on their relatives.<br> I could get real news to your husband.<br> He's dead.<br> What about your people? What do they do?<br> My stepfather's a mechanic,<br> but he's not working.<br> Well, I bet they saved up for a rainy day,<br> like me investing in real<br> estate for my old age.<br> Why, you think how much<br> easier I could make it for you,<br> you being in a delicate<br> condition, so to speak.<br> The little comforts.<br> Maybe you got a habit that's hard to break,<br> cigarettes or something.<br> I know how it is.<br> I could get you whatever you wanted.<br> Time's money to me. I can't<br> favor every one of 60 girls.<br> Mom would be glad to help if she could.<br> No dough, eh?<br> Follow me.<br> Home, sweet home.<br> Just like the big cage in the zoo, only<br> you clean it up instead of the keeper.<br> Bucket and brush is in the corner closet.<br> Mrs. Benton said I was<br> going to work in the laundry.<br> I'm the boss here. Start scrubbing.<br> But Mrs. Benton told me...<br> Where do I begin, Miss Harper?<br> Now you're getting hip.<br> Use this lye. Soap's low.<br> Okay, get going.<br> Didn't you ever scrub a floor<br> before? Put your shoulder in it.<br> You're doing okay.<br> Keep that up, and you and me<br> are gonna get along just fine.<br> Pipe the new fish.<br> Millie, the old dame in the bed<br> says you loud-talked to Harper.<br> That took guts.<br> How much time are you pulling?<br> One to 15 years, but I come<br> up for parole in 10 months.<br> Just a hot minute. What's your rap?<br> Robbery.<br> Society. Larcenists don't talk to CPs.<br> CPs?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - CP, common prostitute.<br> Where you been living, the moon?<br> Her name's Smoochie.<br> Glad to meet you.<br> Got news for you. She's all right.<br> I'm Kitty Stark, and that's<br> Claire. What's your name?<br> Marie Allen.<br> Stop scrubbing. Chew the fat.<br> Hey, Lottie, check her.<br> Maybe you need bifocals.<br> The dish is poison, Harper's pet nose.<br> - I'll tell Evelyn!<br> - Evelyn! Don't kid me.<br> Harper's first name is Filth.<br> Kitty! Kitty! Oh, Kitty.<br> What's the beef?<br> The matron said if I broke<br> another dish, she'd report me.<br> She refuses to believe I've<br> never worked in a kitchen.<br> Yeah, I know, but ain't I told you<br> not to go shooting your<br> mouth off about yourself,<br> all about the servants you<br> had and your governesses<br> and the yachts your old man bought?<br> Oh, why won't anyone understand?<br> It's always been like that.<br> Even as a child, I had no one<br> to go to when I was in trouble.<br> My parents were always away.<br> Even after I was married, I...<br> You're new here, aren't you?<br> I'm Georgia Harrison. I'm<br> not supposed to be here.<br> I didn't forge those<br> checks. It was all a mistake,<br> but wait until my appeal comes<br> through. Then I'll get out of here.<br> My father's waiting for me,<br> and he knows I'm not guilty.<br> We have a rose garden out in back,<br> and in the summer, it's beautiful.<br> All day, I'll sit and watch the roses,<br> and in the evening...<br> She's a real lady, Georgia,<br> only she married some guy who<br> likes spending other people's dough,<br> so he got her to write<br> out a bunch of bouncers.<br> I got news for you. Georgia<br> gives this place class.<br> She ain't the only one.<br> I had two real mink coats and a<br> closet full of black lace nighties<br> and a shelf full of real French perfumes<br> that my girls lifted right out of<br> one of the swankiest stores in town.<br> Don't rub it in.<br> All I ever had was a different<br> pair of shoes for every night.<br> Chow line!<br> Lottie! Millie! Dottie! Look at...<br> Did you read all about me in the<br> papers? They even had my picture.<br> Get those things out of here.<br> Next time, I'll get somebody to<br> show you how to scrub a floor.<br> In line!<br> Get back to the bullpen!<br> Squealer! How did you get word to Benton?<br> I didn't.<br> You're a liar.<br> You're riding a phony, Harper.<br> It was me got word to Benton.<br> I'm a tall weed in the grass,<br> and the grapevine's blooming.<br> You old buzzard.<br> Lay a hand on me, and<br> I'll put your lights out.<br> I'm in for life. One more like<br> you is just so much velvet.<br> I ain't got no time to argue.<br> Line up for count!<br> - Lewis, Millie.<br> - Christiansen, Velma.<br> - Kopsky, Gita.<br> - O'Connor, Mary.<br> - Devlin, Claire.<br> - Wagner, Rita.<br> - Roberts, June.<br> - Menard, Tina.<br> - Barber, Emma.<br> - Minnelli, Nina.<br> - Cassidy, Katie.<br> - Bates, Naomi.<br> - Stark, Kitty.<br> - Klein, Julie.<br> - Marie Allen.<br> - Allen, Marie!<br> - Allen, Marie.<br> - Mullen, Elaine.<br> - Cardnum, Ruth.<br> - Branigan, Lottie.<br> - Hoffman, llsa.<br> - Stone, Louise.<br> - Vogel, Dottie.<br> - Elkins, Peggy.<br> - Laverne, Frankie.<br> - Orangeman, Hope.<br> - O'Shaughnessy, Mitzi.<br> - Carter, Mamie.<br> - Hansen, Alison.<br> - Jacobs, Hattie.<br> - Yosta, Violet.<br> - Twitchell, May.<br> - Smith, Peggy.<br> - Harrison, Georgia.<br> - Taylor, Alice.<br> - Fuller, Mimi.<br> - Danzig, Lulu.<br> - West, Minnie.<br> You're stir-simple if you<br> think you made more dough<br> playing the con game than I did in my racket.<br> Who are you calling<br> stir-simple, you cheap crook?<br> Oh, quit bragging about how<br> much dough you used to make.<br> Both of you are giving me a pain.<br> I made double what any of you<br> made, and I'm not bragging.<br> There wasn't a crooked jeweler<br> in town who didn't come to me.<br> Once, I stashed a load of<br> hot ice worth 50,000 bucks.<br> What a sweet racket we had!<br> Six suckers a day bit the hook,<br> and we'd lam out of town<br> before the coppers caught up.<br> Joe and me lived high.<br> Gee, you girls are lucky.<br> I always fall in love<br> with a guy that won't work.<br> Last one beat me up, then beat out of town.<br> But I got news for you. Men are important.<br> Personally, I'd hate to see them abolished.<br> If it wasn't for men, we wouldn't be in here.<br> You said it. I've been married five times.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> Nothing, if you're not married to<br> them all at the same time, like I was.<br> I bet you got some story, too, huh, Kitty?<br> Your husband in the stir?<br> He was killed in a holdup.<br> If he was alive, he'd have another<br> dame when you get out anyway.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> How many jobs did you pull<br> before they nabbed you?<br> I don't want to talk about it, please.<br> You will.<br> I want to go home.<br> I want to get out of here.<br> Do you hear that train?<br> People are going home on that train.<br> Conductor, wait for me.<br> Let me on that train!<br> Let me out of here.<br> I don't belong in here.

No!<br> - She's bleeding like a stuck pig.<br> A cold hose will quiet her down.<br> No, Harper, the infirmary.<br> She's cut an artery.<br> File out, you tramps!<br> - Christiansen, Velma.<br> - Kopsky, Gita.<br> - O'Connor, Mary.<br> - Allen, Marie.<br> That old lady of mine, the things she writes.<br> "And I know you'll be a good<br> girl and keep out of trouble. "<br> How much more trouble can I get into?<br> Get lost.<br> You ain't deep.<br> I've been watching you.<br> You're no squealer, so<br> I'm gonna give you a break.<br> What are you gonna do<br> when you flop out of stir?<br> Ever figure on boosting?<br> This kid wouldn't know<br> a booster from a hustler.<br> Boosting, shoplifting, the<br> department store circuit,<br> none of your five-and-dime<br> stuff like your first rap.<br> We operate on a big scale.<br> The boys will protect you<br> just like your own mother.<br> If they protect you, why are you in here?<br> I knocked a guy off.<br> The syndicate pays me for recruiting,<br> so I can take care of Harper.<br> Live easy.<br> You just leave it to me, and I'll<br> see that you get your parole quick.<br> You see, these guys I'm<br> working with, they got drag.<br> Time to flop out, and they'll<br> fake a legit job for you.<br> With the soft dough you can make shoplifting,<br> you can get the things a girl likes.<br> I know what's going through her<br> head. She's been listening to Benton.<br> Rehabilitation, taking cold<br> showers, working for good behavior.<br> When I get out, I'm not coming back.<br> - After I'm paroled...<br> - Parole? Didn't the parole board okay me?<br> I've been packed a solid<br> year pulling dead time.<br> You're a repeater.<br> They don't let any con out of stir<br> until the parole officer gets<br> her a job and a place to live.<br> We think we're flopping out, then<br> wham, they can't find us a job,<br> and we're packed in here pulling dead time.<br> You see, kid, in this cage,<br> you get tough or you get killed.<br> Better wise up before it's<br> too late. Now, how about it?<br> Don't think I'm not grateful,<br> but I don't want to get mixed up in anything.<br> I don't think boosting is<br> the only way to get along<br> when I get out of here.<br> I've got to do it my own way.<br> You was a nurse in the free<br> side. What's the matter with her?<br> Nothing that vitamins<br> and calcium wouldn't help.<br> You got them pills in the pogey?<br> They never heard of anything but aspirin.<br> Tell the nurse I said she should go<br> out and get you whatever stuff you need.<br> That slob will do it. She owes me plenty.<br> I'm all right now.<br> Marie knows where taking<br> favors from you will land her.<br> - Ain't you learned nothing?<br> - Quit needling her.<br> The only thing important is my baby.<br> If you're old enough to have a kid,<br> you don't need this big sister<br> sticking her nose where it don't belong.<br> Harper.<br> Tomorrow's parole-board day.<br> Would you find out if my name's on the list?<br> - Mrs. Benton promised that the moment...<br> - You're on the list.<br> Nice work, kid.<br> I got a new bra you can have.<br> I got some slick, new perfume you can have.<br> Let me iron your dress.<br> Want me to put your hair<br> up in curlers for you?<br> Do they fit?<br> They pinch a little, but<br> they look better than mine.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, how do I look?<br> Oh, fine.<br> I'd have gone crazy if I<br> had to pull another year.<br> I'll be 30 soon.<br> After you got out the first<br> time, what made you fall back in?<br> The same thing that got me in the first time,<br> a guy.<br> When I met him, I was wet behind the ears,<br> sex and love and marriage all mixed up.<br> When I got out of school, he hired me.<br> I didn't know until it was too late<br> what kind of a dirty racket he was in.<br> I loved him too much to walk out on him.<br> You're lucky your man's dead.<br> - Don't say that!<br> - Your man's dead.<br> He can't turn you into a<br> two-time loser like mine did.<br> Even after I got out the first time,<br> there he was, waiting for me,<br> but that's all over with.<br> I'm starting from scratch.<br> They flopped me back.<br> They flopped me back.<br> Quit cheating, you dirty crook.<br> Who you calling a dirty crook?<br> Shut up, the both of you, and play cards.<br> - She called me a dirty crook.<br> - Well, it's true, ain't it?<br> Yeah, but I got a right to be<br> sensitive about it, ain't I?<br> I'll call you and up two.<br> You're loaded with nothing.<br> There's your two and three more.<br> You in this pot, June?<br> The twister and the slammer.<br> Three hundred and sixty-five more<br> nights and days, and I wake up.<br> Get a load of the new look.<br> By the time we get out of<br> here, it'll be the old look.<br> I got news for you.<br> If that's what dames are wearing<br> now, I'm glad I'm in here.<br> The guy outside likes the way I look.<br> Just bought himself a brand-new car.<br> Must be a truck.<br> He's taking me to a show.<br> Tough they flopped you back in.<br> We could have double-dated with his friend.<br> After the show, he's taking me to his place.<br> He's got a room up over<br> the bar where he works.<br> Real comfortable, if you know what I mean.<br> Every time he kisses me good night,<br> I just want to keep on leaving him.<br> - He's got...<br> - Keep your snoot out of our business.<br> Good night, girls. Pleasant dreams.<br> At least we got honest matrons in here.<br> When I bribe one, she stays bribed.<br> Anything you want?<br> Harper! Harper!<br> Before you go, you better tell<br> Benton. June's acting stir-bugs.<br> All repeaters act queer<br> when they're flopped back.<br> Pete don't like me to keep him waiting.<br> See you in the morning, girls.<br> June.<br> June. June.<br> I'd like to speak to Dr. Saunders.<br> What? I can't hear you.<br> Yes, I know.<br> He's not here. He went out on a case.<br> Dr. Ashton? This is Ruth Benton.<br> I'm sorry to call you at such an hour,<br> but I remember your offer<br> to be a free consultant.<br> An emergency. A premature birth.<br> Eight months.<br> Yes, thank you, Doctor.<br> What's everybody blowing their fuse for?<br> I've delivered kids in here by the dozen.<br> It's a miracle he didn't die.<br> Get a clean blanket.<br> When my dog had distemper,<br> I took him to a cleaner<br> infirmary than this one.<br> Yes, I know, Doctor.<br> Twice I've put in requisitions<br> to have this place modernized and repainted.<br> Why not use $1,000 of your<br> budget for the purpose?<br> Maybe if the medical<br> board were to take it up.<br> Five inmates have told me June<br> was acutely depressed last night.<br> They swear they asked you to advise me.<br> You believe any bull these inmates hand you?<br> I've asked you time and time again<br> to watch changes in a girl's behavior.<br> You mean to tell me you couldn't<br> see that she was acting strangely?<br> With 60 girls in my bullpen, my only<br> job is to see that nobody escapes.<br> You helped to kill June just as<br> surely as if you'd hanged her yourself!<br> Will they investigate?<br> I wish somebody cared enough<br> to make an investigation.<br> So what are you going to do? Suspend me?<br> I'm going to do everything<br> I can to have you fired.<br> You gave me three suspensions,<br> and you couldn't make one<br> of them stick, remember?<br> This time, I will.<br> So you call the Commissioner. So what?<br> I call my friend, Thornton Goodrich.<br> He gets the Commissioner on the phone,<br> and, bingo, I'm back on the job again.<br> You sit there on your bustle, the big boss,<br> and think you know how to run this place.<br> Do you know how it ought to be<br> run? With a piece of rubber hose.<br> Break them in two if they talk out of turn.<br> Anyone who doesn't toe the mark<br> sits in solitary for one month.<br> Bread and water.<br> One funny move from a girl, and<br> I clip every hair off of her head.<br> That's the way it used to be run,<br> and that's the way it ought to be run.<br> Just like they're a bunch<br> of animals in a cage.<br> Get out of here.<br> Is she alone?<br> - She is, but...<br> - I'll go right in.<br> If you'd just let me ask her, sir...<br> Mr. Donnolly.<br> Blame the Lieutenant Governor for this visit.<br> He asked me to drop in.<br> I'm always glad to see you, Mr. Donnolly.<br> Too bad about what happened last night.<br> - Please, sit down, Mr. Donnolly.<br> - Thank you.<br> Someone on the state medical board got<br> in touch with the Lieutenant Governor<br> early this morning and raised a big howl.<br> A zealous young doctor. I've...<br> I forget his name. He called the board.<br> He was shocked about the infirmary.<br> I warned you that something<br> like this would happen<br> when the board voted us<br> $8,000 instead of $80,000.<br> Can't you understand that in the long run,<br> $80,000 would have saved the State millions?<br> What do you want for your girls now?<br> A swimming pool? Television<br> sets? A beauty parlor?<br> No, merely the things I worked to<br> get in other prisons and did get.<br> Teachers, a full-time psychiatrist...<br> Now, don't tell me that<br> your inmates fell in love<br> with their grandfather's<br> bicycles when they were little.<br> I'm afraid I'm too tired to<br> appreciate your wit, Mr. Donnolly.<br> I only know what we need.<br> I wish we could drag the public in<br> here to watch the inmates decaying.<br> I have a great respect<br> for you. You're a fighter.<br> I used to be a Golden Gloves<br> boy myself in the old days.<br> They taught me that, when the<br> odds were against a good fighter,<br> to cover up if you wanted<br> to keep on your feet<br> because even though you lose the decision,<br> it's better than a knockout.<br> Good morning, Mrs. Benton.<br> Good morning.<br> - Does it say on his birth certificate...<br> - You got a break.<br> Mrs. Benton insisted we just<br> put the name of the town.<br> Your mother's downstairs<br> in the visiting room.<br> Can she come up and see the baby?<br> It's against orders.<br> Mom.<br> Mom.<br> Marie, baby, you feeling all right now?<br> I'm okay. How are you?<br> Oh, ailing a bit.<br> I hope you understood about me not writing.<br> I mean, I ain't much on writing.<br> Sure.<br> Isn't it wonderful about your grandson?<br> Yeah, wonderful.<br> I'm gonna call him Tommy. Oh,<br> Mom, you're gonna love him.<br> Already he's got hair,<br> the same color as Tom's,<br> but he's got your eyes.<br> I can't take the baby. Oh, I want to.<br> What woman my age don't want a grandchild?<br> But your stepfather won't<br> have it in the house.<br> We argued and argued till<br> I was blue in the face.<br> So help me, if I had a dime to<br> my name, I'd walk out on him.<br> I keep figuring how I could take the baby.<br> I can't leave Gus.<br> There'd be no one to take<br> care of me till you get out,<br> and I ain't getting any younger.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Mom, stop crying. Tom's folks are dead.<br> If you won't take him, they'll<br> put him up for adoption.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> You've got to leave Gus.<br> I'll be out of here in three months.<br> I'll get a job and support you.<br> We'll have a real home,<br> you and the baby and me.<br> Mom, find something until I get out!<br> Well, I'm not as young as I was.<br> I tire easy. The doc says my feet...<br> Can't you think of anyone but yourself?<br> Maybe it would be better<br> if someone else took him,<br> some nice family with money.<br> They could bring him up real nice.<br> I don't want anyone else to have him!<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<br> You're his only flesh and<br> blood. You've got to take him!<br> Don't keep saying that!<br> Don't keep saying that!<br> Mother! Mother, come back here!<br> You gotta take him! You gotta take him!<br> Mother, come back! Mother! Mother!<br> No!<br> Don't let it throw you,<br> honey. You're still a kid.<br> If you get paroled soon enough,<br> there'll be a lot of guys<br> that will tumble for you.<br> You can even get hitched and have another kid<br> if you're dope enough to want to.<br> The trick's to flop out as quick as you can.<br> Like I've told you, the boys<br> can get your parole moving fast.<br> How about it? Don't it make sense, honey?<br> Think it over, sweetie, but<br> get this through your head.<br> If you stay in here too long,<br> you don't think of guys at all.<br> You just get out of the habit.<br> Line up, you tramps!

They hate each other's guts.<br> What's so funny?<br> We've got a new fish coming in.<br> Maybe if you're real nice, you<br> might get her for a roommate.<br> And old friend of yours, Elvira Powell.<br> It's going to be a rich haul.<br> None of your penny-ante stuff.<br> You'll still do what I pay you to do.<br> Them days are over.<br> Hey, girls, take a look at your queen<br> bee. She's buzzing off the throne.<br> She never was nothing<br> but a dime-a-dozen booster<br> with so little influence<br> she couldn't even get off<br> on self-defense for a murder rap.<br> I ain't got nothing against you. It's<br> just a matter of dollars and cents.<br> Elvira Powell's an institution<br> with a big bankroll stashed away,<br> and I always wanted to meet an institution.<br> Someday I'm going to<br> get my hands in her hair,<br> and I'm gonna pull it out by the roots.<br> I made it! I made it! I made my parole!<br> This is Marie Allen.<br> Marie, we have to decide<br> whether nine months has taught you that<br> robbing people at the point of a gun...<br> I never wanted to, but my<br> husband wouldn't listen to reason.<br> I couldn't leave him. I loved him.<br> Now, what type of work can you do?<br> Speak up.<br> I could be a salesgirl or wait tables,<br> work in a laundry after all<br> the experience I've had here.<br> Please try to make your answers brief.<br> This report states your stepfather<br> refuses to have you in his home.<br> Where would you live if paroled?<br> Well, where would you live? With relatives?<br> With my Aunt Rose and Uncle<br> Harry. They're very respectable.<br> Uncle Harry's a gateman for<br> one of the biggest factories.<br> They're very fond of me.<br> If they're so fond of you, why<br> didn't they take your child?<br> Well, a baby would have<br> been a lot of trouble.<br> I wouldn't be.<br> We'll investigate them.<br> Maybe it would be better if I lived<br> alone, anyplace the parole officer found.<br> Out of the question. We must make certain<br> that you have beneficial<br> surroundings and guidance.<br> You're hardly more than a child, only 19.<br> A girl grows old here before her time.<br> Marie's been married. She's<br> seen her husband killed.<br> She's borne a baby here in prison.<br> She's had the baby taken<br> away from her by law.<br> How can anyone be called young who<br> has lived through such experiences?<br> I've lived a lifetime in a year in this cage!<br> If I have to fall back in,<br> I'll be like the others.<br> And I'm not like them!<br> Oh, please. Please, give<br> me a chance to prove it.<br> I've paid my debt. Let me out, please.<br> You'll never regret it. I promise I'll...<br> What? What?<br> Wait till I fix this thing. I<br> haven't gotten the hang of it yet.<br> At your age, with no<br> favorable home conditions<br> and no beneficent influences on the outside,<br> we feel that nine months is too short a time<br> to prepare you for your<br> responsibilities outside.<br> Parole is not granted.<br> We'll review your case in a few<br> months, and you'll hear from us.<br> Got flopped back. Tried to do a mope.<br> Hanging on a bush, eh?<br> Benton says no solitary.<br> Oh, Benton's a fool. If I had her job, I'd...<br> Benton's okay with me.<br> So I go on this picnic, see?<br> Skinny takes me out in a rowboat,<br> begins criticizing my family, though,<br> and to make it worse, he slaps me,<br> so I slap him back.<br> You just slapped him?<br> Well, I did have an oar in my hand.<br> He kept on hitting me,<br> so I kept on slapping him.<br> Still with your oar in your hand?<br> What did you keep on slapping him for?<br> Well, he kept on coming up.<br> Pipe the new fish.<br> Get a load of Elvira Powell.<br> Hello, girls.<br> So help me, I never saw such<br> an old-looking bunch of bags.<br> I've checked in here for maybe six months.<br> Grand jury's having itself a little fun,<br> so in order to save some<br> of my friends embarrassment,<br> I got myself a phony rap so they<br> can't subpoena me as a witness.<br> It'll all blow over by spring.

You're playing a game.<br> Sure, you could sit down in a<br> department store some places.<br> That could be a gold<br> egg you got in your hand.<br> Okay, now try it again, and make out<br> like that cake of soap's a diamond pin.<br> - How much?<br> - $150.<br> Okay, wrap it up.<br> Spotters would have nabbed you.<br> I'm too dumb to be a booster.<br> Some dames got more talent than others.<br> But I got to have some trade<br> if I ever get out of here.<br> You any good at it, Marie?<br> Anybody with half a brain could<br> figure out how to fool a spotter.<br> Pigeon like you would get her<br> wings clipped first trip out.<br> Now, let's see.<br> If this is the jewelry counter,<br> what counter would be over there?<br> I guess perfume, gloves.<br> Then the elevators would be over there?<br> Yeah.<br> - That's showing her.<br> - Guess she showed her!<br> A bull's eye, baby!

Who<br> does she think she's kidding?<br> Lipstick. She knows we can't keep them.<br> She only did it to get Benton sore.<br> She'll drool when she sees the Super<br> coming and taking them away from us.<br> Well, until Benton finds out,<br> I sure feel like a new woman.<br> Rhinestones are phony.<br> You can have real ones<br> anytime you change your type.<br> There's $100 extra in it for you<br> if you get word to Benton<br> that Kitty's recruiting.<br> - Merry Christmas, girls.<br> - Merry Christmas!<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Oh, how pretty.<br> I hope you'll all have<br> a pleasant day tomorrow.<br> Let's hope that many of you<br> will be home this time next year.<br> Now, tomorrow morning, there will<br> be Christmas services held here<br> for any of you who might like to attend.<br> Oh, Ann, where did the lipsticks come from?<br> Elvira Powell.<br> Oh, of course, by way of Harper.<br> Girls?

What's new in the social set?<br> Kitty Stark is still in solitary.<br> I think she'll listen to reason now.<br> Meaning what?<br> She tried to play rough with me when<br> I was taking her down to the hole.<br> I didn't tell you to get tough with her.<br> By the time I got through with<br> her, she knew I meant business.<br> Look what she's got.<br> I found it outside the<br> laundry. I'm gonna keep it.<br> Sure must be a dopey cat to crawl in here.<br> Boy or girl?<br> I'm not taking any chances.<br> I'm gonna call it Fluff.<br> Harper will pitch a doozy if she finds it.<br> I'll bring my milk from supper.<br> Line up for count!<br> Line up for count!<br> - Lewis, Millie.<br> - Christiansen, Velma.<br> - Kopsky, Gita.<br> - O'Connor, Mary.<br> - O'Brian, Julie.<br> - Wagner, Rita.<br> - Devlin, Claire.<br> - Minnelli, Nina.<br> - Barber, Emma.<br> - Menard, Tina.<br> - Cassidy, Katie.<br> - Bates, Naomi.<br> Okay, where is it?<br> You don't get no breakfast<br> till you hand over that cat.<br> You know it's against the<br> rules to have any pets.<br> Hand it over.<br> Stop it!

I got debts.<br> Shut up.<br> Yes.<br> I want to speak to Thornton Goodrich, please.<br> Tell him Evelyn Harper.<br> Yes, ma 'am.<br> We're sort of distant cousins,<br> you know, Thornton and me.<br> Good morning.<br> Happy New Year, Thornton. How are you?<br> Oh, just fine, thanks.<br> I got something you ought to know.<br> Oh, I couldn't tell you over<br> the phone, but it's dynamite.<br> Those filthy lies!<br> But at least it's nice to know we<br> have the support of so many people.<br> Three welfare leagues,<br> a half a dozen women's clubs<br> from all over the country.<br> If they'd only get<br> together and stick together,<br> then maybe situations<br> like this wouldn't arise.<br> You can just bet the<br> others have organization.<br> And they won't stop there.<br> What are you going to do?<br> I'll know better after I<br> talk to the Commissioner.<br> They're sitting outside looking so smug.<br> Send them in.<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning, Commissioner.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> I think there are ashtrays handy.<br> The Governor's madder than a turkey gobbler.<br> Everyone's on my neck<br> because of what you've done.<br> Aren't you confused, Commissioner?<br> It wasn't I who gave those<br> ridiculous stories to the papers.<br> What's the idea getting Harper<br> sore over nothing at all?<br> I suppose a man would call the clipping<br> of a girl's hair nothing at all.<br> Well, you could have talked it over with<br> her instead of flying off the handle.<br> The Commissioner means,<br> your predecessor never<br> quarreled with the staff.<br> My predecessor refused to<br> regard criminals as human beings.<br> I've tried to change that attitude.<br> I intend to keep on trying.<br> There is no place on my staff<br> for matrons like Evelyn Harper.<br> It's too bad all this had to<br> happen before she was fired.<br> Who said anything about firing her?<br> Why fire a political appointee<br> just because of a minor<br> difference between you and her?<br> Besides, firing her won't do us any good.<br> It's this stink we've got to squelch.<br> How do you intend doing that?<br> I can get Harper to take back what she said.<br> She can call it a mistake,<br> admit that she was hot-headed.<br> The directives, Sam.<br> Well, I'm coming to that.<br> At the same time, we'll announce<br> that these directives are to<br> be put into effect immediately.<br> Directives?<br> The Commissioner has put it<br> in the form of a memo to you.<br> "Inmates who have been honor<br> women will no longer be put<br> "in subordinate positions on the staff.<br> "The proposed plan to allow<br> occasional work outside the prison<br> "when merited by selected girls is denied<br> "as well as the proposed<br> plan for educational... "<br> You don't honestly think I'd consent to that?<br> Why, I'd be betraying every man and woman<br> working to free prisons<br> from methods like yours,<br> to insulate them from the abuses<br> of politicians, cheap politicians.<br> Have respect for my position, Mrs. Benton.<br> I wouldn't allow the Governor<br> to speak to me like that!<br> Oh, Fred, Mrs. Benton,<br> let's not lose our tempers.<br> Look, we came here with the<br> best intentions in the world,<br> hoping to get together with you,<br> to let this thing all blow over,<br> but you leave me with no alternative,<br> except to ask for your resignation.<br> If he asks for my resignation,<br> I'll demand a public hearing.<br> Now, just see here. We can get together.<br> We can if you tear up those<br> directives and fire Evelyn Harper.<br> That will clear my name<br> and allow me to do the work<br> that must be done around here.<br> He'll do nothing of the kind.<br> Then I'll announce you've<br> asked for my resignation,<br> and I'll demand a public hearing.<br> The State allows me such<br> a hearing, and you know it.<br> Let the public learn how this prison is run.<br> Fire me, Commissioner. I insist on it.<br> I want that public hearing.<br> Marie Allen, back from the hospital.<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> Stop it!<br> Peggy Elkins.<br> Naomi Bates.<br> Honest, sometimes I wish<br> that old lady of mine<br> - would stop writing me.<br> - Julie Klein.<br> - "I sure wish you could be out by Easter...<br> - Tammy Slovo.<br> "... so you could see your kid brother...<br> - "... graduate from high school. "<br> - Thelma Graham.<br> She must think I'm in a country club,<br> - taking a rest cure.<br> - Ruth Cardnum.<br> - I got news for her.<br> - Nina Christiansen.<br> My kid brother's gonna<br> get graduated without me.<br> Mimi Fuller.<br> Judas Priest!<br> Mary O'Connor.<br> Arlene Sidney.<br> Evelyn Mason.<br> Alma Jones.<br> Mary Adams.<br> Luana Cohen.<br> Gee, look how she looks.<br> - Guess you'd look that way, too...<br> - Tracy Swanson.<br> ...if you had a week in solitary.<br> - Yeah, and almost a month in pogey.<br> - Helga Jorgensen.<br> I didn't know what kind of a heel Harper is.<br> She's like a cop I was sweet on once.<br> He used to work guys<br> over for no reason at all,<br> just because it made him feel important.<br> If I'd known, I wouldn't have started on you.<br> Quit shaking the tambourine.<br> I'll be sprung soon.<br> You'll run the cage again.<br> If I can do anything for you,<br> try to get your rap shortened...<br> What did you say?<br> - Wagner, Rita.<br> - Devlin, Claire.<br> - Minnelli, Nina.<br> - Barber, Emma.<br> - Menard, Tina.<br> - Cassidy, Katie.<br> Bates, Naomi.<br> Don't be smart. Let's have the name.<br> Stark, Kitty.<br> Taylor, Alice.<br> - Allen, Marie.<br> - Mullen, Elaine.<br> Okay, dummy, if you can't hold<br> that cup, get back to the bullpen.<br> Feed your faces and keep your traps<br> shut if you don't want to get...<br> Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!<br> Kindly omit flowers.<br> Sunday. Nothing for me to do except<br> think about the next 10 years.<br> Here today, here tomorrow.<br> What's your itch?<br> Oh, I keep thinking of Kitty sitting<br> in the death house, and I get...<br> Take it easy before you blow a tube.<br> You got to hand it to Benton.<br> Even with all her trouble, she<br> tried to keep Kitty off the hot seat.<br> Yeah, she kept telling them<br> Kitty was off her trolley.<br> Boy, what's going on in Benton's office!<br> There's six matrons spilling over<br> and a bunch of girls from the other bullpens.<br> - What did you tell Benton?<br> - I shot the works.<br> Helen wrote down every word,<br> all about Harper chiseling<br> the liquor and soap and things,<br> what she did to Kitty. I<br> sure gave them a earful.<br> You know something? I think Benton<br> might use me as a witness at the hearing.<br> Maybe there are a few things<br> I can tell her tomorrow, too.<br> I've got news for you. She talked<br> to me like I was anybody else.<br> Bet you a pack a week<br> you'll still be pulling<br> dead time next Christmas.<br> Keep your big flapper shut.<br> Claire's giving it to you straight.<br> Ain't you played the honest John too long?<br> You could have made a swell booster.<br> You still can get out of here.<br> You ain't got much time.<br> She's being sprung tomorrow.<br> What do you want Powell to do,<br> send you an engraved invitation?<br> These birdbrains giving you<br> spiel what to do out in free side!<br> Hand me a laugh. I got<br> a file long as your arm.<br> I was queen of the con women<br> when Claire was wearing diapers.<br> There's nothing I ain't<br> done, including murder.<br> Stop tooting your horn.<br> But that makes me the crookedest<br> crook of any of you, don't it? Okay.<br> Before you get any bright<br> ideas, listen to me.<br> I had a first time like you, but<br> I can't remember how long ago.<br> Then the second rap, then<br> the third. Now I'm a lifer.<br> I'll be 71 soon. Been a con 40 years,<br> and you know what I think?<br> Nobody got cheated but me.<br> Forty years taken away.<br> So I'm giving it to you straight.<br> Wait a year on dead time, but<br> get a legit job slinging hash.<br> Then, get a good guy, have a kid.<br> What I'd give for a sink<br> full of dirty dishes.<br> Quiet.<br> No, that's all right.<br> Ain't they cute?<br> Amateurs coming for lessons.<br> Bullpen B, 60 inmates,<br> all types of offenders.<br> This place smells like a zoo.<br> What's she in for?<br> And men call us the weaker sex.<br> - Look at those faces.<br> - Environment, my dear. Environment.<br> They say the Superintendent<br> has a murderess working for her.<br> - Did you make it?<br> - Yeah.<br> Gee, she's getting out.<br> Mamie will press them for you.<br> Marie Allen, checking out. 93850.<br> That's six cents a day for laundry work.<br> Deduct 10 days for having<br> a baby, three days solitary,<br> that's 502 days times six cents.<br> You can cash this on your way out.<br> Oh, wait a minute.<br> Guess you want your wedding ring, don't you?<br> Thanks for the haircut.<br> Sit down, Marie.<br> Now that you're leaving,<br> let's not lie to each other.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - This cashier's job is just a blind.<br> The parole officer okayed it, didn't she?<br> Elvira Powell has a lot of friends.<br> In a couple of more months,<br> the parole officer could have found you work.<br> You'd have made some honest money,<br> have self-respect and decency.<br> Where did those things ever get me?<br> Why do you give up now<br> that you don't need to?<br> When you're free?<br> Free for what? Go to my baby?<br> To sit down to a turkey dinner with a family?<br> To kiss my husband?<br> I know it's difficult to<br> start over again, but...<br> From now on, what's in it<br> for me is all that matters.<br> You did your best and where did it land you?<br> You can't lick the system.<br> Well, if you've got nothing more to say...<br> Well, if you ever need any help...<br> Thanks, but I won't.<br> Well, I hope you win.<br> For that $40 Tom and I heisted,<br> I certainly got myself an education.<br> Here's the address of<br> the parole officer, Marie.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - So long.<br> Front gate, 93850 coming out.<br> That's right.<br> What shall I do with her file?<br> Keep it active.
