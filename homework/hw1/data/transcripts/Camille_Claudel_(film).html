                        Please,<br> I must see Miss Lipscomb.<br> - At this hour?<br> - It's urgent. About my sister.<br> You'll wake the whole house!<br> Miss Lipscomb!<br> It's Mr Claudel.<br> She's vanished.<br> Where could she be?<br> - She told me nothing.<br> - My mother's very upset.<br> Try the studio.<br> PARIS, FEBRUARY 1885<br> Camille!<br> You went digging<br> for clay again?<br> I've just been at your house. Your mother...<br> She nearly called the police this time.<br> And Paul<br> was ready to look for you<br> the world over.<br> Are you listening, Camille?<br> Boucher was right,<br> you've got mud on the brain.<br> You're a nightmare.<br> You never answer me,<br> even when it's about you.<br> Only your work counts.<br> Do you think I was<br> meant to be a sculptor?<br> I'm such a dreamer!<br> Boucher says that<br> Rodin is a genius<br> but that he seduces<br> all the girls.<br> We'll have to watch out.<br> - He's as scandalous as his work?<br> - All his models sleep with him.<br> If he faces the light,<br> we'll see him better.<br> Toto is transparent.<br> - Don't leave it there.<br> - When I'm nervous, I need Toto.<br> He'll think we're mad.<br> He's here!<br> - Let him in.<br> - Why me?<br> Let him in!<br> Hello, young ladies.<br> I know, I know.<br> Yes, I must tell you,<br> I can't stay. I'm in a rush.<br> - Boucher said...<br> - Mr Boucher,<br> If I may say...<br> Boucher...<br> wins a prize, great!<br> A year in Rome.<br> Who wouldn't want to be in Rome?<br> But as for replacing him,<br> that's a big step!<br> No, you have to work the clay.<br> Don't rely on inspiration.<br> It doesn't exist.<br> What can I teach you, anyway?<br> A sculpture takes time.<br> You have to let it rest,<br> forget it,<br> to better judge it.<br> I know. I haven't finished it.<br> It's unfinished.<br> Also, the timing's bad.<br> I've taken on far too much work.<br> Have some tea, at least.<br> Boucher said you left<br> the Academy. Is that true?<br> Yes, why?<br> Shouldn't we have?<br> No, no. You've already<br> solved the heating problem.<br> This is better.<br> Heating is very important.<br> My first studio was a stable.<br> Freezing cold.<br> A rich lady<br> wanted a statue of herself.<br> I didn't have a cent,<br> so I got some old shoes<br> and tried to burn them for heat.<br> The lady arrived and posed,<br> but the smell!<br> She passed out from the smell.<br> The scare of my life!<br> I thought she was dead.<br> What's this prehistoric beast?<br> That's Toto.<br> A small African rhinoceros.<br> Didn't you know?<br> Zero plus zero equals Toto.<br> It's been so pleasant,<br> I forgot I'm in a hurry.<br> Monsieur Rodin,<br> I'd like some marble.<br> - Marble! Have you worked on stone?<br> - Granite. In the country.<br> Rhinoceros, granite...<br> You like challenges, Miss Claudel?<br> Well...<br> ..we'll all think it over,<br> and we'll see about the lessons.<br> I'm not the only teacher in Paris.<br> - Young ladies, goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> He's so handsome and strong!<br> And bright!<br> - What do you think?<br> - Nothing.<br> What do you mean, nothing?<br> We didn't ask him here<br> to tell us stories.<br> That was just to get acquainted.<br> I can't afford it anyway.<br> That type says, ''I know, you don't.<br> I see, you don't.''<br> You're getting carried away, Camille.<br> He never even mentioned our work!<br> Didn't you notice?<br> What a lout!<br> Does that amuse you?<br> Not me.<br> You can yawn for Papa on Sunday.<br> Until now your father went along with you.<br> But this time he won't.<br> The Academy was too disciplined.<br> You want your freedom.<br> Sharing a studio<br> with a dizzy foreigner!<br> You don't care what it costs!<br> Classes, rent.<br> Papa's not home now<br> because he's out earning that money,<br> cent by cent,<br> at the expense of all else.<br> Some life for a man his age!<br> Seeing his family once a week!<br> And what about me?<br> When he hears that you sneak out<br> to steal clay,<br> keeping us up all night,<br> making your brother<br> risk failing school!<br> All for your whims!<br> For your so-called ''vocation''!<br> And you upset your brother,<br> having him read<br> filthy books unsuitable for his age.<br> Unsuitable for any age!<br> - Leave her alone.<br> - That shameless brat!<br> My first marble!<br> He'll like it so much, he'll sign it.<br> Like Michelangelo with his pupils?<br> I wouldn't have Hugo sign my poems.<br> You're an anarchist, Paul.<br> A young savage.<br> I can't bear school.<br> Thank you for giving me<br> Rimbaud's poems.<br> Will I ever be able<br> to run away like he did?<br> I love your writing<br> and I love you.<br> Only you believe in me.<br> - My little Paul.<br> - You look at me so sweetly.<br> - Is that a sin?<br> - Sin doesn't exist.<br> MARBLE WAREHOUSE<br> Limet!<br> Give this young lady some marble.<br> One of the chunks from Eve.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm being visited<br> by the Ministry of Culture.<br> Send my regards to Jesse Lipsomb.<br> Send Louis with her.<br> Do you have tools for marble?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good luck, then.<br> The Gates of Hell will be<br> one of the century's most beautiful...<br> But you're far from finished.<br> Are the Cathedrals finished?<br> What do you usually work with?<br> - Green granite.<br> - From Soissons?<br> Yes.<br> Eve!<br> Mr Rodin is spoiling you!<br> This is pure Pitacci.<br> Smell it!<br> This one will probably do nicely.<br> That one?<br> No. This one.<br> Paros, from Greece.<br> Be careful, it's fragile.<br> - A hand, or a handout?<br> - Neither.<br> Why accept an official order<br> for work you don't plan to do?<br> We'll never stay on schedule this way.<br> My ideas don't come made to order.<br> - What did she choose?<br> - The pyramid.<br> - The little one?<br> - Yes, the Paros marble.<br> She doesn't know<br> how hard it is to work with.<br> One wrong tap and it breaks in half.<br> She's too young to know.<br> - She should take lessons.<br> - I don't have the time.<br> And I've seen her work.<br> There were two heads.<br> An old woman and a tramp.<br> Merely sketches.<br> You know, when the clay is more alive<br> than the model, like real flesh.<br> That's rare.<br> You're wrong about her.<br> She doesn't need lessons.<br> Boucher's wrong, too.<br> She'll learn by doing.<br> ''With that horrible warning<br> ''as the steel touched my neck<br> ''my body shivered and<br> a muffled cry escaped my lips.<br> ''The executioner's hand trembled.<br> '''Sir', he said to me...<br> '''Have I hurt you?'<br> ''These hangmen have soft hearts.''<br> You seem to love Victor Hugo, Giganti.<br> He's the greatest man alive.<br> He's all I have.<br> Now I have you, too.<br> Rodin could not have been indifferent.<br> The Dean of the School of Fine Arts<br> thought you were already Rodin's pupil.<br> What have I done<br> to deserve such a daughter!<br> Always conniving<br> to steal her father's money.<br> Don't you interfere.<br> That tramp!<br> If my first baby hadn't died,<br> I'd never have given birth to her!<br> She behaves like a boy!<br> She hurts me,<br> sets her father against me.<br> He'll make us all suffer for her filth.<br> Madame, get dressed, please.<br> It doesn't help to shut yourself away.<br> It's not me who should be shut away!<br> Louise Athanaise! Come on out!<br> Good morning, Monsieur Limet.<br> - No luck?<br> - Thank Monsieur Rodin for me.<br> Jessie, read this!<br> Read it out aloud!<br> ''Young ladies,<br> I have found better than classes,<br> ''I am beginning a major project<br> and need apprentices.<br> ''Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m., my studio.<br> Rodin.''<br> Watch your step!<br> - Morhardt!<br> - Hello. Where's our friend?<br> Bad timing.<br> Monsieur Rodin isn't here.<br> He's very busy these days.<br> Rodin goes too far.<br> Did you see those two young girls?<br> On the Gates of Hell there'll be<br> small statues of the damned.<br> Rodin has great ideas.<br> With a little help from Dante<br> and his Divine Comedy.<br> He doesn't need help.<br> He's been commissioned.<br> The boss will accomplish<br> what he wants. He always does.<br> - He's like a father to me.<br> - You certainly love him.<br> Marcel, you needn't have<br> written on the cloth!<br> Miss Claudel did it.<br> Foolishness!<br> Remove that scroll!<br> Put the two Adams back together.<br> Move out of the way!<br> Young lady,<br> stand between them again.<br> That's nice.<br> Very nice.<br> Make me another Adam for tomorrow.<br> Very nice.<br> Thank you, everyone.<br> How was Victor Hugo's first sitting?<br> I love him. I'd like to sculpt him nude.<br> Like the God that he is!<br> - Hey, girls! Got a man?<br> - They're not telling.<br> - Stuck-up!<br> - She's a proper young lady.<br> She's cultured, she's saving it.<br> Tell me, when do we see Rodin work?<br> He's busy thinking.<br> He'd better watch out!<br> Women are less important<br> than official orders.<br> An artist is an artist.<br> The truth is, he has no ideas.<br> You know that Rodin is busy<br> arguing with the Minister.<br> You know that he's the biggest<br> lecher since Victor Hugo.<br> I'm sure it will be beautiful, Giganti.<br> You'll be almost crouching,<br> with your head down,<br> leaning on your left knee.<br> And your arms,<br> your arms will hang down,<br> hugging one leg.<br> I'm sure it will be very powerful.<br> Powerful. And tender.<br> Just like you.<br> - Taking a break?<br> - It has to dry.<br> - Want company?<br> - All the screens are taken.<br> You wouldn't know what to do.<br> Come on, honey!<br> Show me what you've got!<br> - Get off!<br> - You're asking for it!<br> I'll get you.<br> Girls don't play coy for long, here.<br> You can play without me.<br> - Leave her alone.<br> - You! You'd better stick to plastering!<br> Don't you get it?<br> You're like plaster.<br> - Dull and sticky!<br> - Where are you going?<br> Back to my real work!<br> Forget it.<br> You don't stand a chance!<br> What's wrong? Problems?<br> I've just passed an angry young girl...<br> Wait for me in the office.<br> Return to your pose, Adele.<br> He doesn't like my marble foot.<br> - He'll never sign it.<br> - Listen to this.<br> ''A miracle is based<br> on three conditions -<br> ''The credulity of all,<br> the good will of some.<br> ''And the tacit consent<br> of the principal creator.''<br> He should have understood.<br> You take everything too much<br> to heart. Did you ask him?<br> He never speaks to me.<br> ''He who is a legend in his own time,<br> is ruled by that legend.<br> ''lt may begin in absolute innocence.<br> ''But, to cover up flaws and<br> ''maintain the myth of Divine Power,<br> ''one has to employ desperate measures.''<br> - We'll hire someone else?<br> - No! Still no word from her?<br> No.<br> This is unacceptable.<br> Why did you leave?<br> Such outrageous behaviour!<br> Are you always so impulsive?<br> I have no time.<br> I didn't hire you as a joke.<br> I need people on the job, day and night.<br> There's work to be done!<br> Where did you find that kind of clay?<br> Under my feet.<br> In Paris, Monsieur.<br> You've got the head and neck<br> but you've neglected the body.<br> The human body<br> is a world that moves. It's life!<br> Never think in surfaces, think in depths.<br> - If you want to copy my Adam, look...<br> - No, I wasn't.<br> Where's your model?<br> Not a pro, I hope.<br> They're too soft, flabby.<br> Come and look.<br> Stand here, look.<br> You must search in the neck.<br> You must force the muscles. Here.<br> Here. You never see me work,<br> so you think I do nothing.<br> Careful, you'll hurt him!<br> There you are.<br> You spare your model.<br> You're bold enough<br> to sculpt a nude man.<br> But you make him comfortable,<br> and you hide his body.<br> I'll show you where I work in<br> secret.<br> You grant that I'm bold, at least.<br> You're intelligent<br> and you work from the heart.<br> But you go about it the wrong way.<br> Do you want me to teach you?<br> No. I don't need lessons or advice.<br> I work directly with live subjects.<br> I accept, Miss Claudel.<br> Am I fired?<br> She's a pupil.<br> Oh, another pupil.<br> That's a shame!<br> Because I froze yesterday.<br> What are we trying?<br> I hope today you have an idea, at least.<br> The longer you think, the colder I get.<br> One can only see the profiles in shadow.<br> That profile is no good. See?<br> - Won't you go in?<br> - No.<br> I'll go see Jessie first.<br> No, not tonight.<br> I'll see her tomorrow.<br> You already know things<br> that took me years.<br> And, what I saw in Italy.<br> Michelangelo's unfinished slaves,<br> lost, abandoned in a dark corner.<br> The chance of what's left unfinished.<br> It's a complete emotion<br> before pure genius.<br> Like the other day when I saw you.<br> All white,<br> standing between my two Adams,<br> you gave me the idea for a third one.<br> I thought inspiration didn't exist.<br> - Sorry?<br> - I thought inspiration didn't exist.<br> I'm so happy.<br> I'm so happy, Camille.<br> I'll take you wherever you want.<br> Anywhere.<br> - To the studio.<br> - Your studio?<br> Yes... No.<br> Giganti will be asleep.<br> I'll go in.<br> - Shall we go to Italy?<br> - I'm going in.<br> - Afraid of being scolded?<br> - No.<br> Honest?<br> I'm no longer a child.<br> And my mother doesn't speak to me.<br> Why not?<br> She doesn't like sculpture.<br> ''All that filth...''<br> Mine always said, ''Get rid of them!<br> They're everywhere!<br> ''Even under the bed! Your mess!''<br> You see, I'm twice your age,<br> but we'll have the same memories.<br> Good night.<br> I never meant to copy your Adam.<br> My Giganti hides his body<br> because he's hurt.<br> Your coat!<br> At least you know what moves you.<br> I no longer know.<br> Look, Paul.<br> He signed!<br> Have you heard?<br> Victor Hugo is dead.<br> Is that her? You were right.<br> She has eyes you read about.<br> Deep blue, Schwob.<br> Victor Hugo is dead!<br> Victor Hugo is dead!<br> Victor Hugo is dead!<br> All of France weeps for Hugo,<br> and you cry over nonsense!<br> I want to go with you!<br> But it's a funeral!<br> I'm saving you the trip.<br> I want to see the procession.<br> There isn't one.<br> Yes, there is! I read about it.<br> Now, Rose.<br> The truth is, you're ashamed of me.<br> - You'll be happier on your balcony.<br> - Oh, leave me alone!<br> Have you seen Giganti?<br> What heat!<br> Oh, such heat!<br> Can't you play something else, dear?<br> She said,<br> ''You're ashamed of me!''<br> And you know what he said?<br> ''Rose, you'll be happier on your balcony.''<br> And old Rose was dressed in pink,<br> from head to toe!<br> - Who is this Rose?<br> - Louis says it's ancient history.<br> - Is she his wife?<br> - One of many, but they're not married.<br> - You're sure?<br> - Positive.<br> Her name is Rose Beuret.<br> It's hot, isn't it?<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Yes.<br> - Sure?<br> - Yes!<br> Get dressed.<br> That funeral wore me out.<br> Poor Victor Hugo.<br> Here. Come back tomorrow,<br> it's too hot today.<br> Goodbye, sir.<br> Another macabre shindig<br> that turns into crap.<br> All the simpering and fake grief.<br> His corpse comes in handy.<br> You're a fine sight in those dark panes!<br> The country will do us all good.<br> She thinks she doesn't need the rest.<br> She's sulking.<br> Walk around!<br> You'll step on your sisters' skirts!<br> I've invited Monsieur Rodin to Villeneuve.<br> It's time we thanked him.<br> But, Papa, he's too busy.<br> He can't come.<br> I wrote to him. We'll see.<br> Tell the priest<br> I still want to tear down his church.<br> Louis Prosper!<br> Stop tormenting that poor priest.<br> Enjoy yourselves!<br> See you on Sunday.<br> Monsieur Rodin.<br> Don't come, I beg you.<br> Don't come to Villeneuve.<br> Look at the curves of the steeple.<br> Delighted to meet you.<br> - We wanted to thank you.<br> - We feel honoured.<br> How was your trip?<br> Camille! Our guests are here.<br> We used to live here all year<br> but my husband works<br> in Rambouillet now.<br> And then,<br> Camille dragged us to Paris.<br> Here's Camille.<br> - Rose, this is Miss Claudel.<br> - I know.<br> May I present my brother, Paul.<br> Delighted.<br> Sensual pleasures<br> are everywhere.<br> The colour of the foliage.<br> The quality of the sky.<br> - Stop! Rose will catch on.<br> - I don't care.<br> The silence!<br> If only we had lettuce like this in Paris!<br> You flatter my wife, it's her garden.<br> I grow tomatoes on my balcony.<br> It's very practical!<br> Rose is full of good ideas.<br> I don't want to see them.<br> You should have stopped him.<br> And he brought her!<br> I'll never forgive you.<br> - Would you like to wash your hands?<br> - Yes, please!<br> Follow me.<br> Wear down the clay.<br> Aren't you glad to see me?<br> Why did you come?<br> It's horrid. I'm ashamed.<br> It's a good way to keep time.<br> To be precise, Madame,<br> this poor priest keeps us informed<br> of all his pitiful activities.<br> Are you a practising Catholic?<br> I do as Monsieur Rodin does.<br> And what does Monsieur Rodin do?<br> This may surprise you,<br> but I almost became a monk.<br> I was young.<br> My older sister,<br> Maria, whom I adored.<br> She became a nun after<br> a promise of marriage fell through.<br> She died of grief.<br> After her death<br> I entered the monastery.<br> To keep her alive I led her life.<br> To my surprise, my Confessor<br> asked me to do his portrait.<br> By making me sculpt,<br> he brought me back to life.<br> To my life, I mean.<br> It's a miracle that he<br> recognised the difference<br> between grief and a vocation.<br> No doubt.<br> I think I'd do the same thing.<br> You?<br> You'd become a nun?<br> I'd stop sculpting.<br> What arrogance!<br> From whom do you get it?<br> Camille is not arrogant.<br> She just won't settle for less<br> than she thinks she deserves.<br> If she's wild,<br> it's only because she's passionate.<br> As a child, she used to make<br> human skeletons out of clay.<br> Then she'd bake them in the oven.<br> She'd forget to eat and drink.<br> It was astounding.<br> If she has her moods,<br> it's because she's uncompromising.<br> Monsieur Rodin must have realised this.<br> Isn't that so, Monsieur Rodin?<br> Ah, temperament!<br> Where do we get our temperament?<br> We don't know what it is,<br> but we know what it does!<br> The Gates of Hell is three years behind<br> because of these clowns.<br> Look.<br> Look. I still need the feet<br> and the hands. You see?<br> And do you know<br> the Burghers of Calais?<br> Can anyone tell me<br> what happened there?<br> I'm still struggling with Victor Hugo.<br> He let me do his bust,<br> or rather he sulked.<br> I had to run to my turntable<br> before I forgot everything!<br> And Balzac.<br> Have I caught him or not?<br> How can one capture<br> a man's mind in his face?<br> It's not them, it's me who is the problem.<br> So, if I don't want to be<br> hounded by bureaucrats.<br> I must have help.<br> I can't work alone.<br> And Jessie Lipscomb<br> is leaving us for England.<br> I need qualified artists.<br> Talented ones! And fast!<br> No time to lose.<br> There you are.<br> Which brings me to the main reason<br> for my visit here.<br> I want Camille in Paris!<br> Oh, yes.<br> That's the end of her holiday!<br> Madame Rodin, coffee is served.<br> I feel you're abandoning me.<br> - You're abandoning me!<br> - Rodin didn't come to say goodbye.<br> Give his secrets to the English.<br> I won't give them.<br> I'll sell them!<br> They're here!<br> Welcome.<br> Marvellous, isn't it?<br> Pure 18th century.<br> Change the locks.<br> - It sure stinks.<br> - Industry, Louis, industry.<br> I thought the Neubourg Folly<br> was a madhouse.<br> - Did you check thoroughly?<br> - Yes. Nobody's living here.<br> The country.<br> Right here in Paris.<br> Do you like our new studio,<br> Miss Claudel?<br> I'm the happiest woman alive.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> TO LE Look how beautiful you are.<br> Look.<br> Stay with me tonight.<br> No.<br> I don't want to upset my family.<br> Louis Prosper, come inside now.<br> You'll catch cold.<br> When I think Camille doesn't even bother<br> to come home on Sunday.<br> Your one day at home.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> She's a bad example for Paul.<br> I couldn't find Giganti!<br> You'll forget him.<br> He'd have been a good<br> Burgher of Calais. To work!<br> Did you love her?<br> I know you loved her.<br> You never dared tell her.<br> I'll tell you a secret, Giganti.<br> Without her, I don't know...<br> She's my only source of inspiration.<br> What does she have that I don't?<br> MINOR EXHIBITIONS<br> It's too dark, I can't see anything.<br> I can see you perfectly well.<br> - It's completely different.<br> - What's the difference?<br> What's all this get-up for then?<br> Unbelievable. Ridiculous set-up.<br> Is Miss Claudel making a fuss?<br> Photographers!<br> You think you're artists,<br> but you create nothing!<br> Look at her!<br> Look at her.<br> Night and day she works,<br> from the clay to the stone.<br> She's the best I've had,<br> but she doesn't have cat's eyes!<br> That's enough.<br> He's right.<br> It's far too dark.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - But I need it<br> - for that American newspaper.<br> - It's all work with you.<br> - No! Come on, Camille!<br> - Good evening, sir!<br> Just look at them!<br> Scandalous!<br> - I'm going.<br> - No. What will I do without you?<br> Poor boy, drowning in filthy water,<br> too disgusted to call for help,<br> he lets himself die.<br> I want to go far away,<br> leave Paris,<br> leave the family,<br> leave everything around me<br> before I go under.<br> Rodin will surely help you.<br> You'll join the foreign service.<br> At least now you remember I exist.<br> What's this?<br> Your sister and her fiance are here!<br> Tell Rodin you'd prefer China or America.<br> Your fiancee is a fine pianist,<br> Mr Massary.<br> Please excuse us for a moment,<br> Mr Massary.<br> What are you lovebirds doing?<br> Come, have your picture taken.<br> Rodin was going<br> to give you a raise. Did he?<br> He has promised me, Papa.<br> Does he pay you regularly?<br> Yes.<br> The Burghers of Calais<br> are nearly done.<br> And what's your part in all that?<br> Since you met Rodin,<br> you've done no work of your own.<br> That's not true.<br> He's more concerned<br> about my future than I am.<br> This is December.<br> If you haven't begun,<br> you'll miss the Salon.<br> You've exhibited nothing yet this year.<br> I've learned to work faster from him.<br> My daughter didn't need to meet Rodin<br> in order to be someone!<br> Don't ever forget,<br> that we are the Claudels,<br> and that we are different!<br> You've always worked faster<br> and better than the rest.<br> Don't forget what Boucher said,<br> you have to exhibit to make your name.<br> There's no other way.<br> I know, Papa.<br> Look at me, darling.<br> Look up.<br> Your future belongs to you.<br> Also...<br> Don't be seen too much<br> with Monsieur Rodin.<br> People might gossip.<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> You can see your sister later.<br> She's here for good.<br> Please...<br> Lunch is ready.<br> This lunch meant so much to Camille.<br> What a cook Rose is!<br> Winter will be rough.<br> Whenever I'm still hungry<br> I eat the bread.<br> Thanks, I'm fine.<br> Let's write to my friend<br> in Foreign Affairs together.<br> This way.<br> Madame, I have good news.<br> You're pregnant.<br> I know you'll overeat again.<br> I despise these people<br> and their damned dinners.<br> How can you pander to people<br> who don't even understand your work?<br> - Let the Mayor of Calais come here.<br> - It's the whole town council of Calais!<br> I hate these parties!<br> This isn't the life for me.<br> Go, see your Minister alone.<br> I'm glad I won't be seeing you!<br> Marry me.<br> ''Dear Rodin,<br> ''I can't come to Calais.<br> I have no hat or shoes.<br> ''My boots are all worn out,<br> and I have no suitable clothes.<br> ''So, excuse me,<br> ''and don't think it bad faith.<br> ''I began a portrait of you.<br> ''From the clay,<br> I'll make a plaster mould.<br> ''When the mould is set,<br> I'll just have to break it<br> ''for you to appear.<br> ''Camille.<br> ''I sleep naked<br> so it feels like you're here,<br> ''But when I wake up,<br> it's just not the same.<br> ''Don't be unfaithful to me.''<br> You'll never get him!<br> He's mine!<br> Where would you be<br> without your hands?<br> Next time, I'll kill you.<br> Traitor, crook, turncoat, drunkard,<br> vampire, scoundrel, vermin, knave,<br> swine, festering ordure, scum,<br> skinflint, Judas, cretin, anarchist,<br> blackmailer, felon, fathead,<br> slob, fruitcake, intellectual,<br> opportunist, conspirator, idiot,<br> imbecile, yid, slobberer, Calvinist,<br> debaucherer, pallid.<br> Stop it, Camille.<br> - You have a fever<br> - emasculated, senator,<br> - Go and lie down.<br> - Robin.<br> That's enough!<br> Rascal,<br> Holy Joe, Zola,<br> bin, fish,<br> - I'll come tomorrow.<br> - hydrocephalic, garbage,<br> - Good evening.<br> Freemason,<br> communard, odd ball.<br> Papa, it's for you.<br> - Camille has disappeared.<br> - What?<br> She left everything behind.<br> What is it now?<br> You've just got back from Calais.<br> - Nobody's seen her in three days.<br> - I can't do anything tonight.

But, still...<br> At last we're leaving Paris<br> after those years of hard work<br> that poisoned our tranquillity.<br> If you really need to,<br> come with us to Villeneuve.<br> There's no shame.<br> Many unmarried girls do it.<br> My newspaper would love<br> an interview with her.<br> The modern woman in her own words.<br> Do you think she'd agree?<br> She's a considerable sculptor and...<br> Is she really<br> working on her own now?<br> I showed her where to find gold,<br> but the gold she finds is hers.<br> I'm not very cheerful.<br> I've become a stranger to myself.<br> There's always something missing.<br> Your voice has changed the most.<br> Nothing that's monstrous<br> is foreign to me.<br> You, at least, are used to it.<br> All your intrigues...<br> You can't deny it.<br> You can be so nasty at times.<br> I find that you're not well.<br> Your Balzac is a noble idea,<br> Auguste Rodin.<br> That's not the general opinion.<br> That statue has made me<br> the laughing stock of Paris.<br> My Balzac!<br> I'll end up<br> putting it in my garden!<br> Stay with me.<br> I want to make love to you.<br> Your little musician, Debussy isn't it?<br> Was he good at making love?<br> Be quiet.<br> Anyway, I hate music.<br> Why don't you touch me?<br> No. Let me discover<br> your work, will you?<br> Why?

Everything!<br> I've ruined your life?<br> I wish I'd never met you!<br> I'd rather be in an asylum!<br> - That's where you'd like to put me!<br> - Completely crazy.<br> You're completely drunk!<br> Completely drunk.<br> You've started drinking.<br> Everyone says so.<br> If I didn't drink they'd all know<br> you put me in this state.<br> So let them think I'm in this state<br> because I drink!<br> Camille, I'm a well-known<br> professional sculptor.

Camille.<br> You're the only one<br> to whom I've confided all this.<br> Don't show this to anyone.<br> I'm here on behalf of Eugene Blot!<br> Did Rodin send you?<br> Oh, I know. You're his mistress.<br> I've seen you with him.<br> No! He's a friend of my father's.<br> My name is Judith Cladel.<br> I'm a journalist writing Rodin's biography.<br> Claudel, Cladel, indeed!<br> Look, my newspaper<br> would love an interview.<br> You can speak to the cats.<br> Rodin says that he showed you<br> where to find gold,<br> but the gold that you found is yours.<br> Rodin.<br> In a beautiful article<br> he wrote about you,<br> Mr Morhardt said<br> your work is unparalleled.<br> What do you think<br> of this honour?<br> That's lovely.<br> That's lovely. These millionaires<br> picking on a defenceless artist.<br> Who wrote that?<br> A Woman Exploited by Camille Claudel.<br> You seem to resent<br> Rodin and Morhardt.<br> However,<br> they have been friends to you.<br> Listen. I promise you,<br> there'll be nothing nasty.<br> Here's what you can write in your article.<br> You have all made false promises.<br> For me,<br> zero plus zero equals zero!<br> Perhaps Rodin thinks I'm dead.<br> - Well, my need for money is not!<br> - You're sacrificing everything for your art!<br> My onyxes,<br> the two green stones there.<br> I polished them myself!<br> And let me tell you,<br> onyx is not an easy stone.<br> I'm here to help you, you know.<br> This article could really help you!<br> Can you pay for my models?<br> My tools, my marble?<br> My coal?<br> My statues benefit everyone<br> except me.<br> You can leave,<br> if you're not here to give me your money.<br> I need to vent my anger<br> on the first person who comes to my door.<br> So it's your hard luck.<br> Maybe I'm wrong,<br> I hope I am.<br> If you are not in with Rodin,<br> I offer my apologies.<br> But if you ever come<br> to do his business,<br> my studio will be permanently closed.<br> Nothing more to say.<br> All the best.<br> Give my regards to Rodin!<br> - Goodbye, Judith.<br> - Goodbye, sir.<br> She's in! Knock!<br> Before she gets herself thrown out!<br> All the lodgers are complaining.<br> I don't have the strength.<br> Here's the rent.<br> Tell her<br> her brother will be back for the summer.<br> Are you drunk?<br> Enough, Camille.<br> Enough!<br> My God, you've changed!<br> Haven't you seen<br> the river rising?<br> The area has been evacuated.<br> He wants to drown me now.<br> The way you carry on!<br> You refused a commission<br> for ten busts of Rodin!<br> You're officially invited<br> to Prague with him, and you don't go!<br> Have some courage, damn it!<br> Your behaviour is irresponsible.<br> You hear? Irresponsible!<br> To complete the picture,<br> you have nothing better to do<br> than mail cat shit<br> to the Minister of Culture<br> and accuse Rodin<br> of stealing the Mona Lisa.<br> Bravo. Very funny.<br> Stop these morbid pranks.<br> Go out! Be seen!<br> React intelligently,<br> instead of burying yourself alive.<br> This is suicide, Camille.<br> I'm afraid.<br> I'm afraid of being robbed!<br> I'm afraid!<br> I'm afraid!<br> Everyone is afraid<br> one time or another.<br> But with me<br> it's all the time.<br> There are people<br> who are bothered by me,<br> who don't forgive me<br> for being so gifted.<br> No, listen, Camille.<br> We haven't met for a long time.<br> What new treasures!<br> Look.<br> This little piece.<br> It's monumental!<br> You mean The Chatterboxes?<br> You call it that?<br> Or The Gossips.<br> Sakountala<br> in marble.<br> And that little girl.<br> Look,<br> I'll give you six months<br> to create a new piece<br> for me, large-scale.<br> I'll arrange an exhibition,<br> a one-man show of your work.<br> They'll see how sublime you are.<br> You look like Cinderella.<br> I like Cinderella.<br> It's like the lower depths here.<br> I'll arrange it all.<br> First, the cats.<br> Don't move. I'll be back.<br> I'll carry you to the boat.<br> Even before she knows how to see,<br> a child reaches out with her tiny hands.<br> The almost maternal joy<br> of shaping modelling clay in her hands,<br> the art of modelling, of possessing<br> durable armies with her hands,<br> these rounded forms,<br> exquisite living bodies,<br> that populate her life.<br> This was her first desire,<br> after tiring of her first doll.<br> Camille Claudel is the first<br> to sculpt the soul.<br> Critics have often<br> compared her art<br> to that of another,<br> whose name I detest.<br> In fact, they could not be more different.<br> The art of that sculptor<br> is the heaviest there is.<br> Some of his figures<br> don't even manage to free themselves<br> from the clay in which they are petrified.<br> When they aren't crawling,<br> hugging the mud<br> in a kind of erotic furore,<br> then each, clasping another<br> body, seeks to recreate<br> the primitive mass.<br> Impenetrable, they repel<br> the light like a thick wall.<br> She's frightening!<br> How embarrassing for her brother.<br> You're a wonderful poet,<br> Monsieur Claudel.<br> She'll never have commissions<br> from high society.<br> You've seen The Gossips?<br> It's so small<br> it fits in your hand,<br> like a secret.<br> Eugene Blot, thank you!<br> Thank you! It's a triumph!<br> Of course she's eccentric.<br> From Camille.<br> She made that dress<br> especially, I couldn't stop her.<br> A circus!<br> Nothing ever comes out of<br> a whirlwind except rubbish.<br> At least Camille's work isn't at all<br> like Rodin's sleazy pawing.<br> Getting over Rodin has been<br> hard on her, you know.<br> She staked everything on Rodin,<br> and she lost everything.<br> My sister.<br> My sister<br> is a living mystery.<br> There's only one way to approach<br> a mystery. Gently.<br> I'm leaving, Blot!<br> Without saying goodbye to her?<br> The reviews were mostly good.<br> They only panned your Perseus.<br> They found it too disturbing.<br> Some felt you portrayed yourself<br> as having a severed head.<br> They've no right<br> to criticise my statue.<br> You've struggled alone.<br> You're the most<br> authentic sculptor I know.<br> Just disregard the salon clique.<br> I sold nothing<br> but I will.<br> I'm not discouraged.<br> Your work can't help<br> but touch the collectors in the end,<br> because it tears my heart out.<br> They scoff at you because<br> they can't destroy you.<br> Genius always terrifies people.<br> I should have bought<br> dresses, hats, instead of<br> indulging my passion<br> for dubious edifices.<br> Your art is so great,<br> nobody understands it any more.<br> I love you, Blot.<br> Send me the marble pieces.<br> No just send me the plaster ones.<br> Keep the marble pieces<br> and the bronzes, too.<br> You go, Robert, talk to her.<br> It's Robert!<br> Open up!<br> You in there!<br> Shameful, using a child.<br> Robert, where's your dad?<br> All they do is sleep!<br> I am a sculptor, sir!<br> I get my ideas at night.<br> That's it! Goodbye, Robert.<br> When I think of<br> how he suffered<br> when he learned the truth<br> about her and Rodin!<br> Such arrogance!<br> Living with him like a kept woman!<br> I don't even dare say<br> what I think!<br> She abused us!<br> Still, I can't abandon my daughter.<br> Something must be done quickly.<br> I, the undersigned, doctor of medicine,<br> certify that Camille Claudel<br> suffers from severe mental problems.<br> She wears rags<br> and certainly never washes herself,<br> She has sold almost all her furniture,<br> although she receives from her family,<br> who also pay for her rent,<br> with which she could live<br> comfortably.<br> She lives in isolation,<br> in a locked room, without air,<br> having sealed the windows.<br> She hasn't been out for several months.<br> She has amounted to nothing.<br> I have amounted to something.<br> She hasn't.<br> Evidently she is still<br> terrified of Rodin's gang.<br> All the gifts nature gave her<br> brought only unhappiness.<br> It's a total catastrophe.<br> My sister is swallowed up.<br> And the danger to her neighbours<br> necessitates<br> her confinement to a mental hospital.<br> All these ordeals in one week.<br> The death of my husband,<br> my daughter.<br> It's horrible.<br> When she's better,<br> you can take her home.<br> VILLE EVRARD ASYLUM<br> My little Paul,<br> You came to see me in May,<br> and I made you promise<br> to look after me,<br> and not to neglect me so terribly.<br> Madhouses are made<br> to inflict suffering.<br> It can't be helped,<br> especially if<br> you never see anyone.<br> They try to force me<br> to sculpt here.<br> They don't succeed,<br> so they make trouble for me.<br> Don't forget, Paul,<br> your sister is in prison,<br> with madwomen.<br> Mama wrote the doctor<br> that I mean to harm you.<br> That I detest you and<br> am out to hurt you.<br> It's not true.<br> I wish she would take me<br> to Villeneuve with her.<br> Do you think I enjoy spending<br> months, years<br> like this, without any news, or hope?<br> Where does such ferocity come from?<br> How did they manage<br> to change you so?<br> I'd really like to know.<br> You might as well send me to Siberia.<br> Did you take care of my things?<br> Are they in Villeneuve?<br> Be careful they don't fall<br> into Rodin's hands.<br> He's so afraid<br> I might come back.<br> That's why he's keeping me here,<br> isn't it, Paul?<br> I would so like to go home<br> and close the door tightly.<br> I don't know if I'll be able<br> to realise this dream<br> to be home.<br> Oh, God,<br> I wish I were in Villeneuve.<br> Your sister in exile.<br> Due to the outbreak of war,<br> Camille Claudel was transferred<br> to the asylum at Montdevergues<br> on 9 September, 1914.<br> She died there on October 19, 1943,<br> after thirty years of confinement.<br>
