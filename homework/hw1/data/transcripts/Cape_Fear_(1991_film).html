                        Hey, daddy,<br> where does Sam Bowden hang out?<br> In there, sir.<br> Court is about over, I think.<br> Oh, no, Your Honour.<br> But this would make the third<br> adjournment of this case...<br> always due to the illness<br> of some defence witness.<br> Granted that this witness is ill.<br> The defence still has 11<br> important witnesses able to testify...<br> while the plaintiff has but one.<br> I submit that 11 against 1<br> should be enough...<br> no matter how sickly and decrepit<br> those 11 happen to be.<br> Opposing counsel will please<br> come closer to the bench...<br> so that we can discuss this<br> more privately.<br> Sam, you know this courtroom<br> gets like an oven.<br> You want a hostile jury<br> on your hands?<br> Let's put it over till fall.<br> Everybody'll be happy.<br> Everybody except my client. He has money<br> due him, and he's badly in need of it.<br> More important, my chief witness<br> is quite an old man.<br> He might not be alive<br> next fall.<br> Motion for adjournment<br> is denied.<br> As it is now after 4:00,<br> this trial will resume Monday morning.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello, Counsellor.<br> You remember me?<br> Baltimore. Eight years,<br> four months and thirteen days ago.<br> It comin' in clear now,<br> Counsellor?<br> Cady. Max Cady.<br> Good. I wouldn't want to think<br> you'd forgotten me.<br> What do you want?<br> You didn't remember me right off,<br> did you?<br> Well, I guess<br> I've changed a little.<br> Where I've been, if you don't change,<br> they're real disappointed.<br> You haven't changed a bit.<br> You know somethin'?<br> That's just the way I wanted it.<br> I wanted you to be just the way you were<br> the last time I saw you.<br> All right, you've seen me.<br> What's the rest?<br> No rest.<br> Just wanted to give you the word.<br> Just wanted you to get the picture.<br> - Give me the keys.<br> - Why not?<br> Now, let me get this straight.<br> You're not still blaming me<br> for what you did.<br> You still don't get the picture.<br> Well, I can see this<br> is gonna take a lot of time.<br> Hey, look at that, would ya?<br> Look at that wiggle.<br> Maybe she thinks we don't know<br> that's on purpose...<br> but we've seen a thing or two,<br> haven't we, Counsellor?<br> You oughta be<br> an expert on such things.<br> I hear you got a good-lookin' wife<br> and a daughter gonna be just like her.<br> Give my love to the family, Counsellor.<br> I'll be seein' ya.<br> Well, anyway,<br> you're ten minutes late.<br> It's a mistake to teach women to tell<br> time. They always use it against you.<br> Please don't be long, Dad.<br> I asked Betty to bowl with us.<br> Betty?<br> That rancid little thing that you detest<br> with every fibre of your being?<br> That was last week.<br> This week, they're inseparable.<br> Think I'll just sit here<br> and keep score.<br> Cheat.<br> - Beer.<br> - Okay.<br> Here you go.<br> - You're kinda fast on your feet.<br> - You have to be around here.<br> - That ring mean anything?<br> - Yeah. It means plenty.<br> Does that mean anything?<br> Dad, you're slipping.<br> Usually you would've said<br> the pin moved.<br> It did.<br> Nice shot.<br> Don't mind me, Counsellor.<br> I'm just gettin' a gander<br> at the rest of your family.<br> You're a lucky man.<br> Did you see my strike, Daddy?<br> Police department.<br> Chief Dutton, please.<br> Chief Dutton?<br> He's probably left, but I'll try.<br> Chief Dutton.<br> Mark. Sam Bowden.<br> Well, hello, Sam.<br> - Mind if I drop over this evening?<br> - Not at all. You know the house.<br> Yes, I know it.<br> Thanks, Mark.<br> What's on your mind, Sam?<br> There's an ex-convict in town,<br> name of Max Cady.<br> Thanks.<br> I think he's starting<br> a war of nerves with me.<br> I hope it's only that.<br> Has he threatened you?<br> No, nothing<br> that would hold in court.<br> You have to know him<br> to feel the threat.<br> He stopped me today after court...<br> and showed up this evening<br> at the bowling centre.<br> He followed me.<br> Why?<br> I was up in Baltimore<br> about eight years ago on a case.<br> One night I was walking<br> back to my hotel quite late.<br> I heard a commotion<br> in the rear of a dark parking lot.<br> Sounded like someone whimpering.<br> I ran over.<br> A girl was being attacked,<br> so I grappled with the man.<br> She suddenly got her breath back<br> and started screaming.<br> When he saw the police...<br> he went completely berserk.<br> Put the girl in the hospital<br> for over a month.<br> That was Max Cady.<br> Later on, I had to go back up<br> and appear against him as a witness.<br> You feel sure that<br> he blames you personally.<br> That was perfectly clear<br> at the trial.<br> Thought it was strange<br> when he showed up here this afternoon.<br> I wasn't...<br> really worried until I saw him<br> at the bowling centre.<br> It was the way he looked<br> at my family.<br> All ex-cons are required<br> to register on arrival in a new town.<br> Sergeant, this is Dutton.<br> Has an ex-con named Max Cady...<br> Hold on.<br> - How do you spell that, Sam?<br> - C-A-D-Y.<br> Has he registered here<br> in the last few days?<br> Chances are he hasn't done it.<br> We can run him out of town on that.<br> Thanks, Sergeant.<br> Hold on.<br> He's smart.<br> Registered yesterday.<br> What address did he give?<br> I see.<br> Switch me to Lieutenant Gervasi.<br> The address<br> is over at the dock area.<br> Sounds like he's short of dough.<br> We can get him on vagrancy.<br> Pete, I want a pick-up<br> on Max Cady.<br> The registration has the description.<br> Fine. Call me back.<br> Thanks, Mark.<br> My family's home alone.<br> I'd better be going.<br> You have a dog, don't you, Sam?<br> She couldn't bite through a doughnut,<br> but she's a good barker.<br> That's good enough.<br> I'll call you when they pick him up.<br> I hope I haven't put you<br> to all this trouble for nothing.<br> - Sam, I hope it is for nothing.<br> - Good night.<br> - You're Max Cady?<br> - I could be.<br> - What's your problem?<br> - We want to talk to you outside.<br> You start reachin' for those,<br> you'd better call for the riot squad.<br> I don't mind a little talk.<br> I just don't like bein' pawed.<br> I'll come back<br> for the change later.<br> I'm gonna give you just one hour<br> to get rid of your friends.<br> Are you trying to pick me up?<br> Yes.<br> You know I'm not drunk.<br> But I'm a cooperative guy.<br> Here.<br> See that card?<br> "John W. Moss, MD"<br> You wanna give me<br> an intoxication test...<br> bring that gentleman down here.<br> I didn't spend eight years in the can<br> studyin' law for nothin'.<br> I've got a legal right to be examined<br> by my own physician.<br> - Or didn't you boys know that?<br> - Never mind.<br> You'll be sober enough<br> when you leave here anyway.<br> Thank you.<br> Come on in.<br> Well, well, well.<br> We seem to be seeing<br> quite a bit of each other today.<br> Strip down to your shorts, Cady.<br> Right.<br> You thought I was gonna object<br> to a strip search, didn't you, Chief?<br> No, siree, not me.<br> Like I said,<br> I'm a cooperative guy.<br> Check that shirt. I got a couple of<br> jolts of horse stashed under the collar.<br> - Let's make with the pants.<br> - Comin' up, Chief.<br> What are you doing in our town?<br> Well, they told me<br> it was a pleasant climate...<br> plenty of boatin' on the river...<br> a lot of fine, stand-up citizens<br> like our friend here, the counsellor.<br> Lfigured that'd be<br> just the place for me.<br> How much money have you got?<br> Here's my wallet.<br> Why don't you check for yourself.<br> Seven dollars.<br> That's just not enough, Cady.<br> I'm charging you with vagrancy<br> unless you're 100 miles away by morning.<br> Would you look just a little harder,<br> please, Chief, sir?<br> A little black bank book in there.<br> Read what that says.<br> - This one?<br> - That's it.<br> Fifty-four hundred dollars.<br> Where'd you get it?<br> It's in the bank right here, deposited<br> this very day. You saw that, didn't you?<br> I asked you<br> where you got it, boy.<br> That could be my business,<br> couldn't it?<br> Would you advise me<br> to answer a question like that?<br> You'd be wise to answer it.<br> That's the kind of advice I like.<br> Like I said, I'm a cooperative guy.<br> Check with the escrow officer of the<br> He'll be happy to tell you<br> exactly where that money come from.<br> - Anything?<br> - Nothing, Chief.<br> - Come on, Sam.<br> - "Come on, Sam"?<br> Y'all kind of friendly,<br> ain't you?<br> Nice, tight little corporation.<br> "Mark, old buddy, I don't like that<br> man's face. Throw him out of town."<br> "Why, certainly, Sam.<br> Anything to oblige you."<br> I'm gonna tell you somethin',<br> mister.<br> You're gonna be old and grey<br> before I ever leave this town.<br> I'll give you a warning.<br> Stay off my property...<br> day or night.<br> Sorry I couldn't phone you sooner,<br> but I was out on a case.<br> I got hold of the escrow officer<br> at his home earlier.<br> Cady sold the old family farm<br> for $5,900, net.<br> He's in the clear, Sam.<br> When are you going<br> to release him?<br> I've already done it.<br> A couple of hours ago.<br> Hold on, Mark.<br> What's going on with Marilyn?<br> I don't know.<br> I can't see her in the bushes.<br> - Where's your mother?<br> - In the kitchen, I think.<br> - You still there, Sam?<br> - Yes, Mark.<br> Just remember that there are legal ways<br> to convince Mr Cady...<br> that this can be<br> a pretty poor place to live in.<br> We'll do all we can.<br> I don't have to tell you<br> to keep your eyes open.<br> You can bank on that.<br> Thanks, Mark.<br> Marilyn stopped barking.<br> Maybe she caught a rabbit.<br> Marilyn never caught a rabbit<br> in her life.<br> - If she did, would she eat it?<br> - She doesn't know rabbits are to eat.<br> Sam! Sam!<br> Sam, come quick!<br> It's Marilyn!<br> She's having a fit!<br> Get the car started.<br> Dad, what's the matter with her?<br> Dad, what's the matter?<br> What's the matter, Marilyn?<br> Oh, Dad!<br> Open the door.<br> I'll get in the back.<br> You get in the front.<br> Maybe we'd better not take her.<br> She can't stay here.<br> Ten-to-one<br> it was strychnine, Sam.<br> You couldn't have saved her<br> if you'd been twice as quick.<br> To me it's the same<br> as murdering a human.<br> It's a shame<br> Nancy had to see it.<br> She was meant to see it.<br> Thanks, Doctor.<br> Don't let Daddy see you like this.<br> But this is when<br> I always feed her.<br> I'd like to speak to both of you.<br> I'm not telling you this<br> to frighten you...<br> but I want you to be careful.<br> I think you're old enough<br> to be told why.<br> Eight years ago I was a witness against<br> a man, and he was sent to prison.<br> The thing is, he's out now...<br> and blames me for his conviction.<br> He's the one<br> that poisoned Marilyn.<br> Maybe,<br> but there's no proof of that.<br> But you know he did.<br> Thinking isn't knowing.<br> Just be careful.<br> This is a big man.<br> He has dark hair.<br> He smokes cigars<br> and usually wears a panama hat.<br> I'll get you<br> a police photograph of him.<br> Until we have this thing<br> under control...<br> I want you never to leave this house<br> or the school grounds...<br> except in your mother's car.<br> There's nothing to worry about<br> as long as you're careful.<br> The police are going to keep<br> a very close watch on the house.<br> The chances are<br> he's just trying to scare us anyway.<br> A man like that<br> doesn't deserve civil rights.<br> Darling, you can't put a man in jail<br> for what he might do...<br> and thank heaven for that.<br> You think we could go away for a while,<br> take Nancy out of school?<br> Well, I did think of that.<br> But Cady can afford to go<br> anyplace we can go.<br> What are we going to do<br> about that man?<br> I don't know yet.<br> I know one thing.<br> Mustn't let him frighten us.<br> That'd bejust playing his game.<br> Sam?<br> What are you doing down here?<br> - I was hungry, and I heard Dad.<br> - Where is he?<br> He's talking to a policeman.<br> Probably just drove along the alley<br> and tossed the meat out.<br> Well, thanks for coming by.<br> Good night.<br> Don't you ever<br> do that to me again.<br> What were your physical findings,<br> Dr Pearsall?<br> Physical findings were a one-inch<br> shortening of the left leg.<br> And the X ray?<br> The X ray revealed that though<br> the fracture had healed...<br> there was marked indication<br> of degenerative joint disease.<br> By degenerative joint disease,<br> you mean arthritis?<br> - Yes.<br> - And what was your diagnosis?<br> Diagnosis was hip fracture with<br> destruction of the joint surfaces...<br> which caused the pain<br> and restriction of motion.<br> You then performed surgery<br> upon the plaintiff?<br> Yes.<br> This model should make the operation<br> easy for the jury to understand.<br> - What is it?<br> - Chief Dutton wants to see you.<br> - Right now?<br> - Right now.<br> Your Honour, may I be excused<br> for a few minutes?<br> Mr Garner will continue<br> the questioning.<br> - Permission granted.<br> - Thank you.<br> Keep him on as long as you can.<br> The jury likes him.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Yes, it is clear to me.<br> That's fine, if you want<br> to handle it that way.<br> Then you tell the county<br> it's their case, that's all.<br> I'm sorry to pull you out like this...<br> but this could be serious<br> for both of us.<br> Your friend Cady<br> turned up with Dave Grafton.<br> Oh, that's it.<br> Well, he got himself the right man.<br> Not for us. You know what he's like.<br> He's one of these ardent types.<br> You slap a cigarette<br> out of some hoodlum's mouth...<br> five minutes later he's in the mayor's<br> office yelling "police brutality"...<br> rallying the bleeding heart squad.<br> - Hello, Dave.<br> - Good morning, Sam.<br> I hope you haven't come<br> to dispute me on any technicalities.<br> No, I'm here as a citizen,<br> not as a lawyer.<br> - Don't worry about technicalities.<br> - Thank you very kindly.<br> First, let me say that my client<br> does not want to make any trouble.<br> He merely wants to put an end<br> to this persecution.<br> What persecution is this?<br> Well, I believe your records<br> will show the following:<br> Detention in jail<br> last Friday night...<br> I agree that you are,<br> technically, within your rights.<br> I merely mention this<br> as the beginning of a pattern.<br> What pattern?<br> I intend to establish<br> this pattern.<br> On Saturday, Mr Cady's room<br> was searched, his car was searched.<br> Did he protest the search?<br> During this time he was made to feel<br> he was suspected of poisoning a dog...<br> a truly despicable act, causing<br> serious damage to his reputation.<br> Hold on right there.<br> I can guarantee you none of my officers<br> mentioned this to anyone but Cady.<br> Perhaps.<br> But people become curious...<br> when a citizen's room<br> is searched by police.<br> On Monday...<br> my client was picked up<br> and interrogated by police...<br> on suspicion of armed robbery.<br> Tuesday, he was forced to stand in a<br> line-up on suspicion of purse snatching.<br> This constant attention<br> by the police...<br> caused his landlady to ask him<br> to vacate the premises.<br> He was forced to find other,<br> more expensive lodgings.<br> All right, what's the point?<br> Don't the police have a right<br> to interrogate a suspect any more?<br> You know, if anybody<br> had told me a week ago...<br> that you were capable<br> of a remark like that...<br> Let me continue with the pattern.<br> On Wednesday,<br> he was picked up twice...<br> first on suspicion of burglary,<br> second on suspicion of grand theft auto.<br> His new landlord became aware of this<br> in some manner...<br> and again Mr Cady<br> was forced to move.<br> His present lodgings<br> are squalid and uncomfortable.<br> Today is Thursday.<br> You must be about finished.<br> For the moment, yes.<br> Then what is this pattern<br> you're talking about?<br> I'm sure Mr Bowden here<br> is still enough of a lawyer to see it.<br> My client is an ex-convict.<br> He's been constantly harassed<br> by the police...<br> subjected to extreme mental cruelty<br> and public degradation.<br> He's even been denied<br> an adequate place to live!<br> To be very blunt, gentlemen,<br> my client has been thoroughly rousted.<br> And isn't it also a fact...<br> that with manpower<br> as short as you say it is...<br> that officers<br> are assigned day and night...<br> to guarding the premises of one private<br> individual, your personal friend...<br> this without any evidence<br> of danger?<br> You're referring to my house?<br> Yes, I am.<br> Then I ask...<br> who furnished you<br> with that information?<br> Well, I think you will find<br> that this is a matter of...<br> common knowledge<br> in the department.<br> Grafton,<br> I want you to listen to this.<br> I don't owe Sam Bowden<br> any special favours, nor do I give any.<br> In each 24 hours, there's been less than<br> two hours devoted to guarding his house.<br> I'm prepared to substantiate that.<br> Now, are you finished?<br> That depends, gentlemen.<br> It depends wholly<br> on the treatment...<br> that my client receives<br> from now on.<br> Come, Mr Cady.<br> Gentlemen.<br> I'll see you around, Counsellor.<br> Now you can see why I wanted you<br> to hear this, Sam.<br> I can't do anything more<br> without an overt act.<br> Like a neat little murder?<br> Well, you show me a law<br> that prevents crime.<br> All we can do<br> is act after the fact.<br> You remember the Hoffman murder?<br> Before she was killed, Mrs Hoffman<br> came up here week after week...<br> telling us that her husband was<br> going to do it, and I believed it.<br> But I couldn't arrest the man<br> for something that might be in his mind.<br> That's dictatorship.<br> Sam, you're a citizen.<br> Would you want it any other way?<br> Then what am I supposed to do?<br> Pull up the drawbridge?<br> Sit home with a loaded gun? Have<br> the groceries dropped in by airlift?<br> That's kind of an artificial way<br> to live, wouldn't you say?<br> Sam, I'm going to make<br> a humiliating suggestion...<br> and it's humiliating for me.<br> You hire yourself<br> a private detective.<br> That's all you can do.<br> Get Charlie Sievers.<br> If anyone can dig up<br> something we can act on, he can.<br> - Private detective.<br> - That's right.<br> I'm not going to go into<br> the "I am a taxpayer" routine...<br> but is that the best<br> you can do?<br> You're telling me<br> to hire protection?<br> It's a hell of a note, isn't it?<br> Either we have too many laws<br> or not enough.<br> Why are we going this way?<br> Better scenery.<br> What would you know<br> about scenery?<br> Or beauty?<br> Or any of the things<br> that really make life worth living?<br> You're just an animal.<br> Coarse, lustful...<br> barbaric.<br> Keep right on talkin', honey.<br> I like it when you run me down.<br> Max Cady.<br> What I like about you is...<br> you're rock bottom.<br> I wouldn't expect you<br> to understand this...<br> but it's a great comfort<br> for a girl to know...<br> she could not possibly sink<br> any lower.<br> Yeah.<br> Tell me some more<br> about that time when you were...<br> queen of<br> the veiled prophet's ball.<br> Operator,<br> Police Department.<br> Give me Sergeant Elkins.<br> Hello, Mike.<br> This is Charlie Sievers.<br> I'm at the corner<br> of Sherman and DeSoto.<br> If you want something<br> on Max Cady...<br> he's up in a room with a girl<br> who just blew into town a few days ago...<br> Diane Taylor.<br> He's in the room with her now.<br> She's over 18, but you can<br> still get him for lewd vagrancy.<br> That's the room.<br> Second floor.<br> Open up! Open up!<br> There's a back door open here<br> and an outside stairway.<br> Something kind of weird's<br> happened to her.<br> I can't get her to spill a thing.<br> Maybe you can.<br> Miss Taylor?<br> You're probably hurt<br> worse than you realize.<br> Would you like me to get a doctor?<br> My name is Charlie Sievers.<br> I'm a private detective.<br> I can help you.<br> No need to take<br> a beating like this lying down.<br> A man like that has no right<br> to walk around free.<br> You've got the law on your side.<br> Why not use it?<br> No one blames you<br> for being afraid of Max Cady.<br> This one's different,<br> and you know it.<br> He beat you up tonight.<br> He'll probably do it again<br> tomorrow night.<br> He might even kill you.<br> Let me take you down<br> to the homicide bureau.<br> I'll show you photographs<br> of girls...<br> who got mixed up<br> with men like Cady...<br> and, Miss Taylor,<br> it'll make you sick.<br> But you'll realize<br> how lucky you are to be alive.<br> Why not protect yourself?<br> Hello?<br> Could you send<br> a taxicab promptly...<br> to the corner<br> of Sherman and DeSoto?<br> I want to go to the bus station.<br> Right.<br> Quick, please.<br> Leave town if you have to,<br> and as I said, no one will blame you.<br> But before you go,<br> help us put this man away.<br> All you have to do is come to police<br> headquarters and sign a complaint.<br> Won't you do that?<br> If not for your sake,<br> for somebody else's?<br> Protect myself?<br> Nobody can protect themselves<br> against a man like that.<br> I'm scared.<br> - You can't help me.<br> - But I can.<br> You file an assault charge,<br> and Cady will get six months in jail.<br> Six months.<br> And after that?<br> When he walked out of this room...<br> he said...<br> he said to consider this<br> only a sample.<br> And from my limited knowledge<br> of human nature...<br> Max Cady isn't a man<br> who makes idle threats.<br> Anyway, you said<br> you weren't a policeman.<br> What do you want?<br> I have a client... Mr Bowden.<br> Mr Sam Bowden.<br> Cady has threatened<br> his wife and his daughter.<br> Never mind the reasons.<br> Mr Bowden is worried,<br> and I can't blame him.<br> You know Cady.<br> You believe that I could ever...<br> ever...<br> in my whole life...<br> step up and repeat...<br> to another living soul...<br> what that man...<br> what he did?<br> What about my family?<br> I'm someone's daughter too.<br> What about the newspapers<br> in my home town?<br> Do you think I could bear<br> to have them read about...<br> I'm afraid I got you here<br> for nothing.<br> She won't talk, and she's<br> leaving town on the next bus.<br> This is Mr Bowden.<br> Once more, before it's too late,<br> would you reconsider?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Really, I'm sorry.<br> So what do we do next?<br> Drop tailing him.<br> You're wasting your money.<br> He expected to be covered.<br> And anytime he wants to shake loose,<br> he'll figure a way.<br> Then what do you suggest?<br> Change his mind.<br> Get in touch<br> with a guy named Jepson.<br> Alex Jepson.<br> He's got some rough friends<br> along the waterfront...<br> and for the right price...<br> Are you kidding?<br> - I can't consider that.<br> - Okay.<br> So you're a lawyer<br> and you believe in due process.<br> But it's your family,<br> not mine.<br> A type like that is an animal...<br> so you've got to fight him<br> like an animal.<br> That's my advice.<br> When can we have one like that?<br> It's on our fiscal program<br> for the year 1980.<br> - What's "fiscal"?<br> - That's what we haven't got.<br> I've been looking for an excuse<br> to quit this... I finally found it.<br> - I forgot to buy paper plates and cups.<br> - You did that on purpose.<br> You can't convict me<br> on mere suspicion.<br> If one rat can leave the ship,<br> why not two?<br> - You take over for a minute.<br> - Where are you going?<br> I have to get more thinner<br> from Tony.<br> If we're a family of rats,<br> I'll leave too.<br> No. You represent<br> a giant stride in evolution.<br> And don't drip any of that<br> on the deck.<br> Hey, Nancy! Ahoy!<br> - Going to the picnic?<br> - Yes, if we ever get started.<br> - We'll go water-skiing. Okay?<br> - Okay.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Just drinking this beer,<br> Counsellor.<br> Do it someplace else.<br> The man sells me a beer,<br> and I might rent me a boat.<br> How many laws you got<br> against that, Counsellor?<br> Look, Cady...<br> maybe you can get away<br> with dog poisoning...<br> beating up on a little drifter<br> like Diane Taylor.<br> Don't push your luck with me.<br> Say, she's gettin' to be...<br> gettin' to be almost as juicy<br> as your wife, ain't she?<br> You rotten...<br> You're not gonna push me<br> into anything, Counsellor.<br> You just had your innings.<br> I'll make my stroke later.<br> I guess you saw that, didn't you?<br> Never laid a hand on him.<br> Just minding my own business,<br> a man walks up and starts beatin' the...<br> How about that?<br> That's him, isn't it?<br> She just ran out in front of me.<br> Nancy, darling, are you all right?<br> I saw him! I saw that man!<br> He chased me into the school,<br> and I couldn't get away!<br> It's all right, darling.<br> I tried to get away, but...<br> He's here. He's here, Mama.<br> - How is she?<br> - She's only bruised.<br> The doctor gave her a sedative.<br> I'm sorry, Sam. I thought the store<br> would only take a second.<br> Sam!<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> But, Sam,<br> he didn't do anything to her!<br> - He didn't hurt her!<br> - Fine. I'll wait until he does.<br> Will you please listen!<br> Lt'll be murder.<br> You know that.<br> Do you want to ruin all of us?<br> Isn't that exactly what he wants?<br> In the name of heaven,<br> pay him off...<br> give him some money<br> and he'll go away...<br> but don't do this to us.<br> If you get into that car,<br> I'll call the police.<br> You won't get halfway into town<br> before they pick you up.<br> Get me the police.<br> Please hurry.<br> Could I speak to Chief Dutton?<br> Mrs Bowden.<br> Bowden.<br> Mrs Sam Bowden.<br> Yes, it's urgent.<br> It's very urgent.<br> Will you please hurry?<br> Hello, Mark.<br> I'm sorry. It's a false alarm.<br> Everything's all right.<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> Right. Good-bye.<br> You're sweatin' a little,<br> huh, Counsellor?<br> Well, I know how it is.<br> I sweat too.<br> For eight solid years I sweat.<br> You gonna buy me a drink?<br> - Waiter?<br> - That'll be double, waiter.<br> Twelve-year-old.<br> My rich cousin here says<br> nothing's too good for ol' Max.<br> - How much do you want, Cady?<br> - How's that again?<br> You heard me.<br> I said, "How much do you want?"<br> Counsellor, you gotta forgive me. I'm a<br> little slow till after my first drink.<br> - I assume we're talkin' about dough.<br> - That's right.<br> Well, that certainly<br> is heart-warmin'.<br> A poor ex-convict comes to<br> a new town lookin' for a fresh start...<br> and one of the leading citizens<br> steps right up...<br> and offers him financial help.<br> That's enough to renew<br> your faith in human nature.<br> It sure is.<br> Hey, buster.<br> You got some salted peanuts,<br> salted in the shell?<br> - Not in the shell.<br> - Okay, forget it.<br> - I'm gonna have to educate this town.<br> - Come on. Let's have the answer.<br> That takes a little figurin',<br> Counsellor.<br> What do you reckon<br> eight lost years is worth?<br> Could a court fix a value on that?<br> Stick to the point.<br> How much?<br> That's too simple.<br> I like to put values on things.<br> Like the value of eight years...<br> the value of a family.<br> Interesting calculations,<br> wouldn't you say, Counsellor?<br> You're right to pass that stuff up.<br> A man told me it was bad for you.<br> Hey, buster, my friend would like<br> to buy me another drink.<br> Ten thousand dollars now and another<br> ten thousand over the next two years...<br> providing you keep out<br> of the state.<br> Suppose I come back<br> after the money runs out?<br> I'll give you a simple answer<br> to that one: I'll kill you off.<br> Well, let me see.<br> Twenty grand...<br> That's less than 3,000 per<br> for my eight years.<br> Counsellor, I don't believe you've<br> heard of the Minimum Wage Act.<br> Now, just for fun...<br> let's go back to talkin' about values...<br> the value of a family.<br> You probably didn't even know<br> I had a family, did you?<br> One wife and one kid.<br> That's what I had when you sent me up.<br> She dumped me.<br> Never even visited.<br> - I signed the divorce papers.<br> - What did you expect?<br> Oh, no, it wasn't that. It was<br> the prison rap that she couldn't take.<br> She couldn't stand the disgrace...<br> and that was your doing,<br> not my doing!<br> She married a plumber.<br> They wound up with a litter of kids.<br> My own kid doesn't even know me.<br> So when I got out,<br> I went to visit her.<br> The plumber was off plumbin' someplace<br> and the kids were all in school.<br> She picked up a poker, tried<br> to hit me over the head with it.<br> I took it away from her and calmed<br> her down. She crawled in the car.<br> I took her 50 miles<br> down the road...<br> - Why tell me all this?<br> - Because I want to tell you all this.<br> That night, I made her call up<br> the plumber and tell him...<br> she was takin' a little vacation<br> from him and the kids.<br> Then I made her sit down<br> and write me a love note...<br> askin' me to invite her<br> on a second honeymoon.<br> She dated it and signed it.<br> I made her write<br> a lot of dirty words.<br> Then I occupied her time<br> for three days.<br> - You beginning to get the picture?<br> - I'm getting it.<br> Good.<br> Then I told her that if she ever<br> blew the whistle on me...<br> I was gonna mail a Photostat<br> of that note to the plumber.<br> I pumped another quart<br> of whisky into her...<br> threw away her dress, threw away her<br> shoes and gave her a fair chance...<br> to work her way home.<br> Charming story.<br> What is it supposed to prove?<br> Counsellor, for a bright fellow...<br> you sure are slow<br> gettin' the picture sometimes.<br> You see, I burned for eight years.<br> Now I've got what you might call<br> "peace of mind"...<br> about my dear, darlin' wife.<br> So no deal.<br> You're gettin' warm, Counsellor.<br> You know,<br> when I was in the bucket...<br> all I could think about was<br> bustin' out and killin' somebody.<br> I wanted to kill him<br> with my bare hands, slow.<br> Every single night for seven years,<br> I killed that man.<br> And on the eighth year,<br> I said, "Oh, no.<br> That's too easy.<br> That's too fast."<br> You know the Chinese death<br> of a thousand cuts?<br> They cut off a little toe...<br> then a piece of your finger,<br> your ear, your nose.<br> I liked that better.<br> By the little toe, I'm to understand<br> "child." That's it, isn't it?<br> That's your train of thought,<br> Counsellor, not mine.<br> My train of thought.<br> Shocking degenerate.<br> I've seen the worst, the dregs...<br> but you...<br> You are the lowest.<br> It makes me sick<br> to breathe the same air.<br> Hey, buster.<br> My cousin left me enough<br> to buy me another blast.<br> This is no war of nerves.<br> He won't be bought off.<br> It's Nancy he's after.<br> And he'll get to her<br> sooner or later...<br> unless I change his mind.<br> I just won't believe it.<br> I just can't.<br> You said yourself,<br> he's too clever to take chances.<br> How could he even touch her<br> without taking a chance?<br> What would you do<br> if she were attacked?<br> - Have him arrested?<br> - How can you ask such a thing?<br> Of course!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Would you have him tried?<br> Pull him into court?<br> Naturally, he'd deny<br> the whole thing.<br> That means that Nancy<br> would have to testify.<br> You've never watched a child<br> testify in such a case.<br> Thank God you haven't.<br> It's the clinical reports...<br> and the questions...<br> and the detailed answers<br> that she'd have to give.<br> She'd have to give them,<br> all right...<br> because he'd deny it,<br> and we'd have to prove his guilt.<br> A beast like that...<br> Who'd believe him?<br> No one.<br> No one at all!<br> But that wouldn't<br> spare her the questions.<br> And Cady knows that.<br> He knows...<br> that we'd never put her<br> through an ordeal like that.<br> There's got to be something we can do.<br> There just has to be.<br> There is.<br> There is.<br> Well, is this Mrs Bowden?<br> Yeah, I knew it was.<br> I just wanted to hear your voice again.<br> You know something?<br> For eight years I dreamed about<br> a chick with a voice like that...<br> just whisperin'in my ear,<br> real close...<br> Don't. Don't.<br> Sayin', "Baby..."<br> Sam!<br> Shut up, you!<br> Counsellor, you really stepped<br> on it this time, didn't you?<br> I don't know what<br> the Bar Association thinks...<br> about its members<br> compounding a felony...<br> but I do know<br> what the law thinks about it.<br> You just put the law<br> in my hands...<br> and I'm gonna break<br> your heart with it.<br> Ain't nothin' can stop me.<br> You understand that, don't you?<br> That house and that car<br> and that wife and kid...<br> they ain't worth nothin'<br> to you now.<br> Now you listen to me.<br> You asked for this.<br> You asked for it,<br> and if you don't get out of...<br> You're wrong, man. I'm gonna<br> show you what it's like to be wrong.<br> Speakin'about<br> your wife and kid...<br> I got a little caper<br> planned for them.<br> Remember the story<br> I told you about my old lady?<br> That was just laughs, Counsellor.<br> That was kid stuff.<br> I got something planned<br> for your wife and kid...<br> they ain't never gonna forget.<br> They ain't never gonna forget it,<br> and neither will you, Counsellor. Never.<br> You'll never forget it.<br> I can't believe we're...<br> standing here talking about...<br> about killing a man.<br> There's still a few ifs,<br> ands and buts about it.<br> I can't go into this alone.<br> I'll have to have help.<br> Of course, he wouldn't fall for it here.<br> He knows we're too much on our guard.<br> But if he got the idea...<br> that we thought she was<br> safely hidden away someplace...<br> "She"?<br> You can't be talking about Nancy.<br> Don't worry.<br> I won't go into this<br> until it's airtight.<br> I won't make a move that<br> will put her in any danger.<br> That won't stop the terror of it.<br> She's only a child.<br> And what about the terror<br> if he catches her really alone?<br> - Sam.<br> - Good morning, Dave.<br> Sleep well last night?<br> Well enough.<br> You needn't bother to open that.<br> You've tried your last case<br> in this state.<br> Your three hired hands landed<br> in the hospital last night.<br> One of them thought he was gonna die,<br> and he talked.<br> - Oh, the judge wants to see you.<br> - Good. I want to see him too.<br> He's gonna tell you I'm instituting<br> disbarment proceedings against you.<br> - You didn't waste much time, did you?<br> - I'm just getting started.<br> The committee on ethics is meeting<br> up at the State Capitol right now.<br> They work real fast. Better have your<br> story ready to tell 'em by tomorrow.<br> You don't think the committee will wait<br> to see if I'm convicted of anything?<br> The committee is interested in keeping<br> the legal profession beyond reproach.<br> After last night, I'm real interested<br> to see how you answer to that one.<br> - Good morning, George.<br> - Good morning, Sam.<br> I only came down to tell you that<br> I have to turn the case over to you.<br> I'll break the news<br> to the judge.<br> Have you gone out of your mind?<br> You've come to the wrong man.<br> Dave Grafton was here ten minutes ago.<br> You haven't got a leg to stand on.<br> Jepson's in there being interrogated.<br> If he talks, I'm gonna have to arrest<br> you before you leave the building.<br> If I'm arrested, who's gonna<br> protect my family? You?<br> That's below the belt, Sam.<br> Grafton's watchin' every move I make.<br> The only answer to Dave Grafton,<br> the ethics committee...<br> and all the rest of it<br> is to show Cady up for what he is.<br> You can't do it with a stake-out!<br> Cady's too smart for that!<br> But I've got it<br> carefully worked out.<br> There's a houseboat.<br> It's up on the Cape Fear River.<br> It has a shore cabin, a telephone.<br> It's isolated, hard to find.<br> - The perfect place to hide my family.<br> - No place is perfect!<br> Do you expect Cady to believe that<br> you'd leave your family alone anywhere?<br> That's the one thing<br> that had me stumped.<br> And this morning...<br> Grafton handed me the answer<br> on a platter.<br> He's forcing me to fly<br> to Atlanta tomorrow...<br> to appear before this committee.<br> You can bet that<br> his friend, Mr Cady...<br> will be tailing me<br> clear to the airport.<br> But the moment<br> I get to Atlanta...<br> I'll hire a car<br> and cut across to the coast.<br> I'll get a boat<br> at Hennessey's Landing.<br> In a few hours, I'll be at<br> the houseboat with Peggy and Nancy...<br> and Cady will think that<br> I'm sweating it out in Atlanta.<br> The next step is to lure him up there<br> when we're ready for him.<br> That's your department too.<br> He knows you're tied in<br> with the case.<br> He'll follow you when you leave town<br> if you make it look right.<br> - He steps ashore and you shoot him?<br> - That's about it.<br> You can't shoot a man for<br> simple trespass. Not any more.<br> - Cady's built a good case against you.<br> - It'll be more than simple trespass.<br> But I won't wait until he wipes<br> the blood off his hands either.<br> Now hold on.<br> Just hold on.<br> I've listened.<br> Now you listen.<br> You're gonna do a foolish thing without<br> help, and you're gonna need lots of it.<br> Now, I can't help you<br> if I wanted to.<br> That's county territory.<br> You know the sheriff. Are you gonna<br> stand on ceremony at a time like this?<br> All you have to do<br> is pick up the telephone!<br> And do what? Ask for half a dozen<br> deputies to help a man I should arrest?<br> I don't want<br> half a dozen deputies.<br> That would be a sure way<br> of tipping off Cady and Grafton.<br> It'd be all over town<br> in no time.<br> One is all I can risk.<br> One is all I'm asking for.<br> Do I get him?<br> Well, this time next week,<br> I may be back poundin' a beat.<br> We should've gone to the left<br> of this island, about a mile back.<br> Are we gonna be completely marooned?<br> No visitors at all?<br> - You didn't say anything to Betty?<br> - I didn't say anything to a soul.<br> Have a nice voyage<br> to nowhere.<br> - I'll see you in a day or two.<br> - Don't get lost on the way home.<br> Do you think she'll be able to stand<br> all this shattering peace and quiet?<br> Don't you worry about Nancy.<br> That's pioneer stock.<br> Cast off.<br> Flight 403 for Atlanta<br> now boarding at gate three.<br> Attention, please.<br> Passengers for Atlanta...<br> flight 403 now boarding<br> at gate three.<br> - I have a brief here for Sam Bowden.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Was he on that flight 403?<br> Yes, sir, he was.<br> Now I don't know whether<br> to mail it to him or not.<br> You don't have any idea<br> when he'll be back, do you?<br> Let's see.<br> He did make a return<br> reservation, sir.<br> - 6:00 p.m. On Thursday.<br> - Then I guess special delivery will do.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - It's just a log bumping.<br> - No, not that. Listen.<br> It's a boat.<br> There are bound to be boats.<br> We didn't hear any last night.<br> It's coming closer.<br> - Peg! Nancy!<br> - It's Daddy!<br> Darling, thank God it's you!<br> Daddy!<br> This is Mr Kersek,<br> of the sheriff's office.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hello. Come on in.<br> Don't you think it's about time<br> you were getting ready for bed?<br> Where am I going to sleep?<br> Here, with your mother.<br> Mr Kersek and I will sleep on shore.<br> - Won't you have some more coffee?<br> - Don't mind if I do.<br> - Will you excuse us for a few minutes?<br> - Sure thing.<br> So far so good.<br> We're all here.<br> Cady thinks I'm in Atlanta.<br> You can still say no<br> if you want to, Peg.<br> Nothing will start...<br> unless I call Charlie Sievers.<br> Call him.<br> I tailed him<br> until he spotted me, Mr Bowden.<br> Then he checked to see<br> your car was home...<br> and Mrs Bowden's car was gone.<br> Looked at the mail in the box<br> but didn't take any.<br> Then he tried the boat basin.<br> Tony told him your boat<br> hadn't been out all week.<br> But for the rest, well,<br> I guess we've missed so far.<br> Because if he's been tailing me,<br> I haven't been able to spot him.<br> I still think he will.<br> You're the only lead he has.<br> - Start things moving tomorrow.<br> - Right.<br> - Yes?<br> - Looks like we're striking out.<br> I'm on 257,<br> halfway to Cross's Landing...<br> and absolutely no sign of him.<br> Do you want me to keep comin'<br> or go back and try it again?<br> Could he have switched cars?<br> Sure, he could have switched cars, but<br> I've been keeping my eye on the drivers.<br> - What do you say?<br> - If he hasn't been following you...<br> trying it again won't work either.<br> - Come ahead.<br> - Okay.<br> - Seven to nothing.<br> - Temporarily. Only temporarily.<br> All them islands look alike.<br> Just follow this and you can't miss it.<br> Okay. Thanks.<br> You're gonna die<br> without a mark on you.<br> Just got too big<br> for your pants.<br> Kersek!<br> Tell the operator<br> to call the sheriff's office!<br> Send some men out here fast!<br> Aw, now, come on.<br> You ain't that scared.<br> You come right down to it,<br> what is there to be scared of?<br> Look, you're not a foolish man.<br> You're very clever.<br> You never make mistakes.<br> You don't take chances.<br> If you touch me,<br> you'll go back to prison for life.<br> - Want to make a bet on that?<br> - But you will! I'm not like Nancy!<br> I'm not afraid to testify! I swear it!<br> Believe me! I'm not afraid!<br> And you're a lawyer's wife?<br> Don't you understand?<br> With consent,<br> there ain't no charges against me.<br> Now, look...<br> I want you to hear this.<br> It's gonna save a lot<br> of messin' around.<br> Look!<br> I was gonna go for Nancy...<br> but I can always<br> make it with Nancy.<br> You know, next week, next month.<br> Wait a minute now.<br> You proposition me.<br> You, instead of Nancy...<br> and I'll agree<br> never to see you again.<br> Unless of course you want it.<br> And that's how<br> you give your consent.<br> That's not consent,<br> it's blackmail!<br> Reasons don't make any difference.<br> You look that up.<br> And as far as blackmail<br> is concerned...<br> you only think<br> I'm going after Nancy.<br> Come over here!<br> You're just playing it safe.<br> Now, your husband<br> is gonna appreciate...<br> your noble gesture.<br> But he ain't never<br> gonna forget it!<br> Please! Please!<br> So, all in all,<br> I don't think...<br> I don't think you're gonna...<br> you're gonna say too much<br> about this, are ya?<br> You're not gonna talk about it,<br> are ya?<br> Are you?<br> No! No!<br> It's Nancy! He only wanted<br> to get you away from her!<br> It's Nancy!<br> Operator!<br> He's here. He's here!<br> Nancy, get out of here.<br> Run and hide.<br> Run and hide! Run!<br> Hide! Hide! Run! Hide!<br> Go ahead.<br> Go ahead.<br> I just don't give a damn.<br> No. No!<br> That would be letting you off<br> too easy, too fast.<br> Your words.<br> Do you remember?<br> Well, I do!<br> Oh, no.<br> We're gonna take<br> good care of you.<br> We're gonna nurse you<br> back to health.<br> And you're strong, Cady.<br> You're gonna live a long life<br> in a cage.<br> That's where you belong.<br> And that's where you're going.<br> And this time, for life!<br> Bang your head<br> against the walls!<br> Count the years,<br> the months, the hours...<br> until the day you rot.<br>
