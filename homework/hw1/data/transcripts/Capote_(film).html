                        Hello?<br> Nancy?<br> Exactly.<br> But at least be honest about the facts.<br> - That's what I'm saying.<br> - Who's honest?<br> I'm honest.<br> I am honest about what I write about.<br> I'll let you know if it's autobiographical,<br> or if it's about me, or if it's not.<br> And I find autobiographical stories<br> at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.<br> ...say I'm one thing,<br> but actually you're another thing.<br> I think being true to who you are<br> is important.<br> I'm not saying you need to be<br> psychoanalytical about the whole mess.<br> - But don't be afraid.<br> - Yeah, I... But don't be afraid.<br> I had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin<br> the other day.<br> - How is he?<br> - He's a lovely man.<br> And he told me the plot of his new book.<br> And he said to me, "But I just want to make<br> sure it's not one of those problem novels."<br> And I said, "Jimmy...<br> "your novel's about a Negro homosexual<br> who's in love with a Jew.<br> "Wouldn't you call that a problem?"<br> And he looked at me and he laughed<br> because he knew I was right.<br> I'm saying, you know,<br> if you're gonna write something like that...<br> at least be honest why you're writing it.<br> Can't we just be honest?<br> Well, I don't think<br> you actually need to be honest.<br> But don't come asking<br> some white man from the South...<br> whether your book<br> about a black man fucking some Jew...<br> when they're both of the same sex...<br> is an issue!<br> Don't ask me that!<br> Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.<br> Everyone's gonna be quite pleased<br> with that topic.<br> So how about you, Truman?<br> Do you admit it?<br> Well, I'm not nearly that controversial.<br> I'm not! I'm not! I am not.<br> I'm not nearly that controversial.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Hi. It's Truman for William Shawn, please.<br> Have you read the article<br> about the killings in Kansas...<br> in the front section of The New York Times?<br> I think that's what I want to write about.<br> I want to go tonight.<br> - I figured you'd missed it.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> That's all right. I thought<br> I was heading to Kansas by myself.<br> God, I'm glad you agreed to come.<br> You're the only one I know<br> with the qualifications...<br> to be both a research assistant<br> and a personal bodyguard.<br> Thank you.<br> Now I'm nervous.<br> Yes?<br> Mr. Truman Capote<br> and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?<br> - That's us.<br> - Where would you like these, sir?<br> You can put that right there<br> between the doors.<br> What all did you bring?<br> Just a few things.<br> - Thank you greatly, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> It's an honor to have you with us, sir...<br> and I hope you won't mind me saying...<br> but I thought your last book<br> was even better than the first.<br> Thank you.<br> I mean, just when you think<br> they've gotten as good as they can get.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Ma'am.<br> You're pathetic.<br> - What?<br> - You paid him to say that.<br> You paid him to say that.<br> How did you know?<br> "Just when you think<br> they've gotten as good as they can get"?<br> I thought that was a good line.<br> - Do you think that was too much?<br> - Yeah, a bit.<br> Your keys.<br> - Sign here, please.<br> - Thank you.<br> Alvin Dewey...<br> Kansas Bureau of Investigation.<br> KBI.<br> KBI.<br> Hi. I'm looking for Alvin Dewey.<br> Hi.<br> Mr. Dewey.<br> Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.<br> - Bergdorf's.<br> - Sorry?<br> - The scarf.<br> - Oh.<br> - Nice.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr. Dewey, I wonder when we could<br> arrange an interview, some time to talk.<br> About what?<br> Well, we're not looking<br> for any inside information.<br> You know, I don't care one way or another<br> if you catch whoever did this.<br> I'm writing an article on how<br> the Clutter killings are affecting the town.<br> You know, how you all are bearing up.<br> I care.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - I care.<br> I care a great deal<br> if we catch whoever did this.<br> Oh, I see.<br> - As do a lot of folks around here.<br> - Oh, of course.<br> Do you have press credentials?<br> - What's a New Yorker?<br> - Magazine.<br> Magazines don't give out...<br> You can come to the news conference<br> with the rest of them.<br> Sears, Roebuck.<br> The boy was 16?<br> He was 15.<br> Nancy was 16.<br> And it's her friend that found them?<br> - Laura Kinney.<br> - Can you spell that?<br> I assume you're okay with the Laura part.<br> K-I-N-N-E-Y.<br> But, please, leave her be.<br> There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.<br> A whole bunch of Mexicans.<br> Hello, George.<br> It's good to see you again.<br> I do have an opinion<br> whether this was the work of one man...<br> or "a whole bunch," as you said...<br> but it doesn't matter a whole lot...<br> whether it was Mexicans<br> or Methodists or Eskimos.<br> We're gonna find whoever did this.<br> Now, four good people<br> from our community are dead.<br> So let's remember that.<br> The West Kansas Farm Committee...<br> is offering a $1,000 reward...<br> for information leading to an arrest.<br> Please print that.<br> And thank you all for coming.<br> He was foxy with that old man.<br> This make you miss Alabama?<br> Not even a little bit.<br> - You lie.<br> - I don't lie.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Hi.<br> Can any of you tell me<br> where I'd find Laura Kinney?<br> Is that her? With the boy?<br> Yeah, with Danny Burke.<br> Danny Burke?<br> Laura?<br> Thank you.<br> Truman.<br> I'm gonna find out where that girl lives.<br> Can I do that alone?<br> All right?<br> Okay.<br> I think I scared a friend of yours<br> this morning.<br> She came looking for you<br> when I was writing.<br> - You hate my friends.<br> - No, I wouldn't say "hate."<br> Just as long as they don't<br> knock on my door.<br> I saw the bodies today.<br> - Which?<br> - The Clutters.<br> I looked inside the coffins.<br> That's horrifying.<br> It comforts me.<br> Something so horrifying...<br> It's a relief.<br> Normal life falls away.<br> But then, I was never much for normal life.<br> No.<br> Yeah, people here won't talk to me.<br> They want someone like you, like Nelle.<br> Me, they hate.<br> I can't think of a single quality<br> I share with Nelle.<br> - Well...<br> - Maybe manliness.<br> - Good morning, Henry.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> Let's go.<br> Bye.<br> Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.<br> Nancy was your best friend?<br> Yeah, she was my best friend.<br> How has Danny been?<br> Pretty shattered.<br> Nothing terrible<br> has ever happened to him before.<br> Danny was the last one at the house<br> that night.<br> That's why Mr. Dewey<br> keeps interviewing him.<br> They don't think<br> that he had anything to do with it.<br> It's just to see<br> if he remembers anything unusual.<br> People in town do seem to wonder<br> if he was involved.<br> Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.<br> Oh, it's the hardest<br> when someone has a notion about you...<br> and it's impossible<br> to convince them otherwise.<br> Ever since I was a child,<br> folks have thought they had me pegged...<br> because of the way I...<br> The way I am.<br> You know, the way I talk.<br> And they're always wrong.<br> You know what I mean?<br> Yeah.<br> I wanna show you something.<br> Maybe this will give you a better picture<br> of what happened.<br> - What is this?<br> - It's your diary.<br> "Danny here tonight and we watched TV.<br> "So nice just having him sit with us.<br> "Left at 11:00.<br> "P.S. He's the only one I really love."<br> And that was that.<br> Did Laura say "shattered"?<br> "Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible<br> has ever happened to him before."<br> You know I have 94% recall<br> of all conversations?<br> I've tested myself.<br> Well...<br> how did that happen?<br> Apparently Detective Foxy's wife<br> has read fiction.<br> That's great.<br> We're in.<br> - We are in.<br> - In.<br> - You came.<br> - Hi.<br> - Thank you for having us.<br> - Thank you.<br> Get yourselves in here.<br> Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.<br> - Hey, little Deweys.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Shake it with your wrist.<br> Use your whole arm.<br> More.<br> You think I'm kidding around,<br> but I'm serious.<br> Mama would've put in half the bottle.<br> She had to buy it by the crate.<br> Alvin's gonna hate this.<br> I have to stop.<br> Oh, I cannot believe<br> you're from New Orleans.<br> I miss it so much.<br> Well, I only lived there for a short while,<br> but my mama was born and bred.<br> You know something?<br> Alvin pretends he doesn't know who<br> you are, but the minute you came to town...<br> - he read your books.<br> - No!<br> He had one of his men pick up<br> Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City...<br> 'cause it's banned in the library here.<br> And he said, "I feel like you're spiting me."<br> I said,<br> "Do you think I took this job to spite you?"<br> I was writing the script as they were filming,<br> all that time in Italy...<br> and I'd work like mad all day long...<br> and then dash down to the bar<br> around midnight...<br> to hand in the next day's scenes.<br> And Humphrey had just about<br> moved into the hotel bar...<br> Humphrey Bogart.<br> ...where he and John...<br> John Huston.<br> ...had...<br> They drank every night.<br> And I mean drank, you know,<br> like famished water buffaloes.<br> Well...<br> I'd only just handed them the final scene<br> when the bellhop told me I had a phone call.<br> And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote...<br> calling to say that my mother had died.<br> I flew home to New York,<br> terribly distraught...<br> but when I got to the apartment...<br> I could see that Joe<br> was in even worse shape than I was.<br> He grabbed my hand and he said to me...<br> "Talk.<br> "Talk about anything." You know?<br> "I mean, any subject in the world.<br> "Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.<br> "Just talk...<br> "so I won't break down."<br> He couldn't bear to be alone<br> with his thoughts.<br> It was too painful.<br> It's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.<br> He and Herb Clutter were good friends<br> from church.<br> Oh, Marie.<br> Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.<br> Why would they put a pillow<br> under the boy's head just to shoot him?<br> Why would they tuck Nancy in?<br> So many of my friends<br> would love to meet you.<br> - Oh, that'd be fine.<br> - You don't have to worry...<br> 'cause I'm not going to write about this<br> till everything's over.<br> Well, I'm not worried.<br> I know what room you're in at the hotel,<br> and I know where you live in Brooklyn.<br> You're celebrating.<br> Well, remember Nelle's manuscript<br> she sent me in New York?<br> Yeah. Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird.<br> - You said it was good.<br> - And I was right.<br> She just heard<br> Lippincott wants to publish it.<br> Well, Jesus.<br> Jesus, well, that's terrific.<br> Tell her congratulations from me.<br> Congratulations.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Jealous.<br> - Will you be home by Christmas?<br> - I wanna come home.<br> I wanna come home. I do. I just...<br> thought if they catch whoever did this,<br> who knows what?<br> - I'll probably be here till next Christmas.<br> - I'm gonna let you go.<br> I...<br> No, don't go.<br> We'll go away next spring to write.<br> - Maybe Spain.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Okay, I'm gonna let you go.<br> - Jack...<br> Jack, I promise.<br> We'll go away this spring to write.<br> - Maybe Spain.<br> - Okay.<br> All right.<br> My wife worked there, too.<br> What did she do in the house?<br> Cleaning. Cooking a little bit.<br> Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.<br> "Girdle up. No extra bulges.<br> "If you're dressed right,<br> when he gets home...<br> "the rest of the evening<br> should be smooth sailing.<br> "Bon voyage, gals."<br> I can't believe you got that whole page.<br> I only read it once.<br> - I've tested my...<br> - Tested myself.<br> - I have 94%...<br> - Percent recall.<br> - Cut that out.<br> - Cut that out.<br> Cut that...<br> Cut that out.<br> Isn't that something, Alvin?<br> Oh, it's impressive.<br> Thank you.<br> - I'm sorry. He's upset.<br> - What's he upset about?<br> They know who did it.<br> Two men.<br> You know, they passed through Kansas City<br> last week writing bad checks.<br> By the time Alvin's boys got up there,<br> they were gone.<br> Skipped out.<br> Yeah. They don't know where.<br> No idea.<br> One of them had a cellmate<br> who gave him up for the $1,000 reward.<br> Do they know the name of the cellmate?<br> No. No, I don't know. Alvin knows.<br> I guess this isn't the appropriate time<br> to go ask him.<br> He's beside himself.<br> Hello?<br> Alvin, get in here.<br> - Dad, it's the telephone.<br> - Not now, Alvin.<br> God damn it.<br> Get over here.<br> - Dad!<br> - Alvin, not now.<br> Sit.<br> Dad? Dad?<br> You need to call the Chief of Police<br> in Las Vegas.<br> - Alvin, what'd you say?<br> - He said you need to call them immediately.<br> - Truman Capote.<br> - Dorothy Sanderson.<br> I figured you'd be left alone this morning<br> by that hardworking husband of yours...<br> so I have breakfast, and I have news,<br> and I have literature.<br> My friend, Jack, mailed me<br> that book you wanted...<br> and I inscribed it myself.<br> "To the maiden of the Midwest,<br> the priestess of the plains...<br> "the queen of the kitchen,<br> my first novel.

Truman in love with Truman.<br> The book I'm writing will return him<br> to the realm of humanity.<br> It's the book I was always meant to write.<br> Well, he hasn't actually<br> written a word of it yet...<br> but he says it's the nonfiction book<br> of the decade...<br> so...<br> So...<br> what have you been doing?<br> And I'll tell you...<br> I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week,<br> talking about movies, art.<br> Finally I had to break it to her that<br> of the four Matisses hanging on her wall...<br> two were upside down.<br> Can I have another, please?<br> To answer your question,<br> I'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's...<br> by blazing a different path.<br> By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.<br> The nonfiction novel.<br> - You have a subject?<br> - Yes.<br> On the night of November 14...<br> two men broke into a quiet farmhouse<br> in Kansas and murdered an entire family.<br> Now, why did they do that?<br> Two worlds exist in this country.<br> The quiet, conservative life,<br> and the life of those two men.<br> The underbelly. The criminally violent.<br> And those worlds converged<br> that bloody night.<br> Now, I spent the past three months...<br> interviewing everyone in Kansas<br> touched by that violence.<br> Now I spent hours talking to the killers...<br> and I'll spend more.<br> 'Cause researching this work<br> has changed my life.<br> You know, it's altered my point of view<br> about almost everything.<br> Yeah.<br> And I think those who read it<br> will be similarly affected.<br> So you find them a new lawyer.<br> Well, they're facing execution in six weeks.<br> You know, they need someone<br> to argue whether or not that's right.<br> Okay.<br> And I'd also like to see them alive.<br> - Well...<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I need to hear their stories.<br> Well, just be careful what you do<br> to get what you want.<br> I'm finding them a lawyer.<br> - Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.<br> - No, I'm finding them a lawyer.<br> There's a difference.<br> The Warden will see you now.<br> Well, we do all right by our boys.<br> Showers once a week.

You must be really desperate<br> for a story to come all the way out here.<br> You want to go see Perry, go ahead.<br> Thank you.<br> You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote...<br> he's just trying to prove<br> the insanity defense.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> It's Truman. It's your friend.<br> It's okay.<br> This is before she had us.<br> Before she started drinking.<br> Who took care of you as a child?<br> Orphanage.<br> Me and Linda.<br> And that's your sister?<br> You know, we're not so different<br> as you might think.<br> Yeah, I was abandoned repeatedly<br> as a child.<br> My mama would drag me along<br> to some new town...<br> so she could take up<br> with another man she'd met.<br> Night after night,<br> she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.<br> Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff<br> not to let me out no matter what.<br> And I was terrified.<br> And I'd scream my head off...<br> until finally I'd collapse...<br> on the carpet next to the door<br> and I'd fall asleep.<br> Then after years of this...<br> she just left me...<br> with relatives in Alabama.<br> Who raised you up?<br> My aunts.<br> And that's where I met Nelle.<br> And she lived next door.<br> Your mother was Indian?<br> Cherokee.<br> So drinking was not a good thing for her.<br> No tolerance for it.<br> We're on suicide watch.<br> That's why they leave the lights on at night.<br> I hope we're past that now.<br> I do.<br> Be careful of Ricardo.<br> I think he wants you all to himself.<br> All right.<br> But he's naturally mendacious.<br> Not to be trusted.<br> If he had $100,<br> he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.<br> Perry, I want to take your notebooks<br> with me.<br> I want to read them.<br> If I leave here without understanding you...<br> the world will see you as a monster...<br> always.<br> I don't want that.<br> 'Cause he trusts me.<br> I mean, that's why he gave it to me.<br> And he's given me absolutely everything.<br> And he wants so badly<br> to be taken seriously...<br> to be held in some esteem.<br> Do you?<br> Do I what?<br> Do you hold him in esteem, Truman?<br> Well...<br> he's a gold mine.<br> And he's told me his entire life.<br> His dead mother.<br> He had a brother and a sister<br> kill themselves.<br> Awful.<br> Did you tell him<br> your mama did the same thing?<br> See, I can't tell him everything.<br> We've been talking our heads off<br> for the past month.<br> And sometimes...<br> when I think how good my book can be,<br> I can hardly breathe.<br> Anyway, this is what<br> I wanted to read to you.<br> "If called upon to make a speech"...<br> "If called upon to make a speech"?<br> I mean, this is exactly<br> what I'm talking about.<br> A speech, just in case<br> he's ever recognized for an achievement.<br> "I can't remember what I was going to say<br> for the life of me.<br> "I don't think ever before have so many<br> people been so directly responsible...<br> "for my being so very, very glad.<br> "It's a wonderful moment and a rare one.<br> "Thank you!"<br> There's an exclamation point<br> at the end of that "thank you"...<br> in case you didn't catch it.<br> Where'd you go?<br> I guess it stopped being funny.<br> I never said it was.<br> Wait, listen to this.<br> I was 14.<br> One day I said to her, "Mom's dead."<br> I could see it.<br> A week later we got the news.<br> She finally drunk herself...<br> Found her shivering...<br> She hit me so many times<br> with that flashlight...<br> she broke it.<br> That night,<br> I dreamed about that big yellow bird.<br> Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.<br> Lifted me to the sky.<br> Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.<br> Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.<br> Hey, you look good. Healthy again.<br> You know,<br> I've decided on a title for my book.<br> I think you'll like it.<br> It's very masculine.<br> In Cold Blood.<br> Isn't that good?<br> And that refers to the crime or the fact<br> that you're still talking to the criminals?<br> The former, among other things.<br> I see.<br> I wanted to ask...<br> if you'd let me look<br> at your investigation notes.<br> That lawyer you helped find<br> for your friends...<br> got them a hearing<br> at the Kansas Supreme Court...<br> I heard this morning.<br> ...on the issue of inadequate counsel.<br> Alvin...<br> I mean,<br> do you not want me to look at your notes?<br> You are permitted to say no.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> If those boys get off...<br> I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.<br> I have to be in court at 9:00...<br> but you call Roy Church<br> and he'll show you what you want to see.<br> Thank you.<br> It's as much for me as for anyone.<br> I couldn't bear the thought<br> of losing you so soon.<br> We're gonna be able to use your book<br> for our case.<br> You'll write<br> we never got to raise an insanity plea.<br> You wrote how terrible the lawyers was.<br> I haven't written a word yet.<br> What have you been doing?<br> Research. Talking to you.<br> All right.<br> - I had hoped...<br> - What are you calling it?<br> The book?<br> I have no idea.<br> Perry...<br> if I'm going to write about you...<br> if I'm going to determine<br> how to write about you...<br> we need to talk about...<br> you know, why you're here.<br> You know, the murders...<br> and that night...<br> at the Clutter house.<br> Do you worry what I'll think?<br> Is that it?<br> Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.<br> I know a lot of people.<br> Perry, I have invitations<br> to be in Morocco, Greece...<br> and I prefer to be here...<br> with you.<br> Jack, be patient with me.<br> I'm just missing this one piece.<br> Well, how long is that gonna take?<br> Why don't you just try leaving him alone<br> for a while?<br> Come to Spain.<br> You can always visit him later.<br> I don't know.<br> Well, I'm off. I'm just...<br> I've got my own writing to do.<br> Well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.<br> There's too many people around. I've...<br> I'll leave the address on the kitchen table.<br> Well, think about what I said,<br> and join me when you can.<br> I will.<br> - I will.<br> - Okay?<br> Bye.<br> Hi.<br> Truman.<br> We never intended on killing that family.<br> Capote, will you get that straight<br> in your book, please?<br> No premeditation.<br> What are you doing?<br> I have to fly back East.<br> When?<br> An hour. I miss you already.<br> Write me every five minutes.<br> Hey, you know,<br> we never did intend on killing that family.<br> Capote?<br> Capote?<br> What?<br> Truman...<br> I've not been able to tear myself<br> away from your book.<br> It's that good.<br> It's not good, it's astonishing.<br> - This first half is astonishing.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> When will you be done, do you think?<br> Yes, I'm already well into the third part.<br> But...<br> I can't finish that till I convince Perry<br> to describe the night of the killings to me.<br> I was planning to visit this fall, see?<br> Then I think you need to talk to him now.<br> And we all need to see how this ends<br> for the final part.<br> I can't finish the book<br> till I know what happens.<br> If Perry and Dick are executed,<br> it's one thing.<br> And if not, well...<br> Truman, you got your ending.<br> I really don't know.<br> The Kansas Court denied their appeal.<br> It came over the wire on Friday.<br> I mean, you need to talk to Perry now.<br> He'll be dead by September.<br> I mean, I'm sorry.<br> I know how much<br> you've come to care about him.<br> Right. Yes, right.<br> So I want to set up a reading for you<br> in the fall, in New York...<br> and, well, we'll build some interest,<br> and we'll publish in the fall.<br> Thank God. There's nothing in the house.<br> Why aren't you working?<br> Well, I knew you couldn't be counted on<br> to stock the kitchen.<br> What are we going to feed<br> our famous guest?<br> Oh, Jesus, I completely forgot.<br> Plus, I finished my novel yesterday.<br> What?<br> When was the last time you wrote to him?<br> I don't know.<br> What's this?<br> It's a letter for Truman<br> I was asked to deliver.<br> It's from Perry.<br> Let's have it.<br> "Dear friend Truman, where are you?<br> "Read this item in a medical dictionary.<br> "'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia...<br> "'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae...<br> "'by laceration of the trachea.'<br> "Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.<br> "Missing you.<br> "Alone and desirous of your presence.<br> "Your amigo, Perry."<br> Mr. Shawn told me<br> about the court decision yesterday.<br> I was wondering<br> why you were in such a good mood.<br> That's a terrible thing to say.<br> I write him all the time. I've just...<br> I've been so focused on the book lately.<br> So Jack thinks I'm using Perry...<br> but he also thinks I fell in love with him<br> when I was in Kansas.<br> Now, how both of those things can be true<br> is beyond me.<br> Thank you.<br> Well, did you?<br> Did you fall in love with him?<br> I don't know how to answer that.<br> Truman.<br> It's as if Perry and I grew up<br> in the same house...<br> and one day he stood up<br> and went out the back door...<br> while I went out the front.<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> - No.<br> Listen, you be nice to Jack.<br> Sometimes I think<br> he's what I like about you best.<br> I'll see you at the reading in New York.<br> - 16th.<br> - 16th.<br> Adis.<br> What was he in jail for?<br> Well, they said<br> it was for not paying his taxes...<br> but really, for being an outsider.<br> Refusing to go along.<br> Lowell, you're being moved.<br> - Why?<br> - You're going to final holding.<br> No.<br> Come on, Lowell. Open the door.<br> Stand up.<br> - Put your arms behind your back.<br> - Okay, last chance.<br> Get up.<br> Turn around.<br> Put your arms behind your back.<br> Now Dick and me, we're next in line.<br> I'm so sorry I've been away.<br> It was a long time.<br> I know.<br> How's the book coming along?<br> Very slowly.<br> Will you show it to me?<br> I've hardly written anything.<br> Good evening, New Yorkers...<br> the first offering of any kind...<br> of Truman Capote's new work,<br> In Cold Blood.<br> Hello. My name is Truman Capote.<br> For this evening's program,<br> I'm going to read some passages...<br> from the first three parts of my new book.<br> "The village of Holcomb stands on<br> the high wheat plains of western Kansas...<br> "a Ionesome area<br> that other Kansans call 'out there. '<br> "Until one morning in mid-November, 1959...<br> "few Americans, in fact, few Kansans,<br> had ever heard of Holcomb.<br> "Like the waters of the Arkansas River...<br> "like the motorists on the highway...<br> "exceptional happenings<br> never stopped there.<br> "Perry Smith's voice<br> was both gentle and prim.<br> "A voice that, though soft...<br> "manufactured each sound exactly...<br> "ejected it like a smoke ring<br> issuing from a parson's mouth.<br> "The four coffins, which quite filled<br> the small, flower-crowded parlor...<br> "were to be sealed at the funeral services...<br> "very understandably...<br> "for the effect was disquieting.<br> "Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet...<br> "her brother a bright plaid shirt.<br> "The parents were more sedately attired...<br> "Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel,<br> his wife in navy-blue crepe.<br> "And it was this especially<br> that lent the scene an awful aura...<br> "the head of each<br> was completely encased in cotton.<br> "A swollen cocoon twice the size<br> of an ordinary blown-up balloon.<br> "And the cotton...<br> "because it had been sprayed<br> with a glossy substance...<br> "twinkled like Christmas tree snow.<br> "One Tuesday at dawn,<br> a carload of strangers...<br> "ignorant of the local disaster...<br> "were startled by what they saw<br> as they crossed the prairies...<br> "and passed through Holcomb.<br> "Windows ablaze.<br> "Almost every window<br> in almost every house...<br> "and in the brightly-lit rooms,<br> fully-clothed people...<br> "even entire families...<br> "who had sat the whole night wide awake,<br> watchful, listening.<br> "Of what were they frightened?<br> "It might happen again."<br> Thank you.<br> And I slipped and I ripped a hole...<br> from the bottom of my scrotum...<br> all the way up<br> to the top of the crack of my ass.<br> And I sat there.<br> And I didn't know it. All I felt was a...<br> I didn't know it. All I felt<br> was a cool breeze, you know, between my...<br> Sorry. If I may...<br> Yes.<br> Your portrait of those men was terrifying.<br> Terrifying.<br> Thank you.<br> Stop that man! Come back here!<br> Dad!<br> Have any of you met my father?<br> He hasn't spanked me in years.<br> George didn't come backstage.<br> He had... He had a...<br> Something that his wife<br> had to rush him off to.<br> - But he made a point of...<br> - Well, I'm still waiting for a call.<br> It was beautiful.<br> And everybody came. Everybody came.<br> - Tennessee loved it.<br> - Of course he loved it.<br> Should we do more?<br> No, we just sit and wait<br> while people talk about it...<br> and we let them do the work.<br> I mean,<br> this book is going to change everything.<br> It's gonna change<br> how people see your writing.<br> I think it's going to change<br> how people write.<br> - Are you gonna be finished by October?<br> - I think so.<br> You know,<br> they're scheduled for next month.<br> To hang.<br> Yeah.<br> We're gonna commit as many issues<br> as it takes to publish.<br> Whatever it takes.<br> Well, I'm going to Kansas tomorrow...<br> - and I'll get Perry to talk.<br> - What's he got to lose?<br> Sorry, but...<br> Hey, this may sound strange to you...<br> but I'm going to miss him.<br> You'll be able to finish now.<br> Need to check your papers, sir.<br> This is what we've been waiting for.<br> A stay of execution<br> to make a federal appeal.<br> All thanks to you.<br> Thank you!<br> They're not gonna corner me now.<br> Not unless the U.S. Government says so.<br> Kansas has had it in for me for 10 years.<br> They can't corner me now.<br> Hey, Perry, sit down...<br> for a minute.<br> I need you to talk to me.<br> We've got all the time in the world to talk.<br> I've been thinking about Ricardo.<br> You really need to stop sending him<br> those trashy books.<br> I won't even mention the pornography.<br> Now, I realize that Dick probably can't grasp<br> the literature that you gave me.<br> And the books you send him only...<br> They only exacerbate the problem.<br> They only heighten or intensify it.<br> Maybe we can get him started on a program.<br> Perry, I know what "exacerbate" means.<br> Okay, well, just thinking...<br> There's not a word or a sentence<br> or a concept that you can illuminate for me.<br> There is one singular reason<br> I keep coming here.<br> - Truman.<br> - November 14, 1959.<br> Three years ago. Three years.<br> And that's all I want to hear from you.<br> Now I asked you not to. Ever.<br> This is absurd.<br> Do you know what absurd means?<br> I'm ready. I have a plane to catch.<br> I found your sister in Tacoma.<br> Maybe she'll talk to me<br> about something useful.<br> Please don't go out there.<br> Hey, this is my work, Perry. I'm working.<br> And when you want to tell me<br> what I need to hear, you let me know.<br> June's dead. Frank shot himself.<br> Now Perry did what he did.<br> I used to love him. He was my little doll.<br> He scares me now.<br> - When was the last time you saw him?<br> - Ten years ago.<br> Ten years.<br> Could I borrow one of these pictures?<br> Take the whole thing.<br> I don't want them anymore.<br> Don't be taken in by my brother.<br> He's got this sensitive side he'll show.<br> You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt...<br> but he'd just as soon kill you<br> as shake your hand. I believe that.<br> Hello, handsome.<br> What's the name of your book?<br> What's the name of your book?<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> "Truman Capote read last night<br> before a packed audience...<br> "from his nonfiction book In Cold Blood."<br> "The true-crime novel<br> tells of killers Richard Hickock...<br> "and Perry Smith...<br> "who brutally murdered a Kansas family<br> three years ago."<br> - Wait, who sent that to you?<br> - That's not your goddamn business.<br> It is my business, because it's not true.<br> The organizers of the reading needed a title.<br> They picked one,<br> a sensational one, I admit...<br> to attract a crowd.<br> - They picked it?<br> - Yes.<br> - It's not your title.<br> - Perry, I haven't chosen one yet.<br> How could I choose a title when we still<br> haven't talked about that night?<br> How could I? I couldn't possibly.<br> You pretended to be my friend.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I should have told you.<br> And I couldn't pretend to be your friend...<br> 'cause the truth is,<br> I can't help wanting to be.<br> You don't have to tell me anything...<br> if you don't want to.<br> I have something...<br> from your sister.<br> She misses you.<br> Look at my belly.<br> There must be something wrong with us,<br> to do what we did.<br> We heard there was $10,000 in that house.<br> Once we tied up everybody<br> and searched all over...<br> I knew the guy that told us about it<br> was wrong.<br> There was no money.<br> Dick wouldn't believe it...<br> so he went tearing through the house,<br> banging on the walls...<br> Iooking for a safe.<br> When he was done...<br> he said he was gonna go up<br> to Nancy's room and have his way with her.<br> I wouldn't allow it.<br> And I told him that.<br> So I sat with her.<br> Dick came up and got me.<br> We turned off the lights<br> and went down to the basement...<br> where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.<br> He kept saying, "No witnesses"...<br> but I figured if I waited him out, he'd...<br> He'd give up<br> and we'd leave them tied up there.<br> And we'd drive all night.<br> They'd never find us.<br> We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists<br> to a pipe over his head.<br> And he looked hurt, so I cut him down.<br> I put a box out there<br> so he'd be more comfortable.<br> He asked how his wife and daughter was<br> and I said they were fine...<br> and they were getting ready for sleep,<br> and it wouldn't be long...<br> till morning when they'd find him.<br> He was just looking at me.<br> Looking into my eyes.<br> Like he expected me to kill him.<br> Like he expected me to be<br> the kind of person who would kill him.<br> I was thinking,<br> "This nice man is scared of me."<br> I was so ashamed.<br> I mean, I thought he was a very nice...<br> gentle man.<br> And I thought so right up till I slit his<br> throat.<br> I didn't know what I did<br> till I heard the sound.<br> Added up...<br> how much money<br> did you get from the Clutters that night?<br> Between $40 and $50.<br> I mean, the truth is,<br> I'm desperate to be done with it.<br> I've spent four years of my life on this book.<br> They got a stay of execution yesterday.<br> Another, yes.<br> Supreme Court.<br> It's harrowing.<br> Me, all I want to do is to write the ending<br> and there's no end in sight.<br> No, thank you.<br> "Dear friend Truman,<br> haven't heard from you in such a long while.<br> "Please help find new lawyer.<br> "If not, Dick will have to write<br> the Supreme Court brief himself.<br> "Our last appeal.<br> What a pair of wretched creatures.<br> "Please help. Your amigo?"<br> "Perry."<br> Just put it with the others.<br> You know, at least for Nelle...<br> you should try and pretend<br> you're having a good time tonight.<br> I thought I'd find you here.<br> Oh, Nelle.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll have another, please.<br> - How are you?<br> - Terrible.<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> I mean, it's torture the way...<br> What they're doing to me.<br> And now it's the Supreme Court.<br> And can you believe it?<br> If they win this appeal...<br> I will...<br> have a complete nervous breakdown.<br> I may never recover...<br> and I'll just pray that it turns my way.<br> - It must be difficult.<br> - It's torture.<br> They're torturing me.<br> I see.<br> And how'd you like the movie, Truman?<br> I frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.<br> Hello.<br> - Mr. Truman Capote?<br> - Yeah.<br> I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith<br> in the Kansas Correctional System.<br> Will you accept charges?<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Smith, you're on the line.<br> Hello.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Perry.<br> They let me make a couple of phone calls<br> before I go down to holding.<br> You heard<br> the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?<br> No, I didn't. I hadn't heard that.<br> Yeah.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Yeah. They let me make two phone calls.<br> We got a date set for the warehouse,<br> Dick and me.<br> Two weeks and finito.<br> April 14.<br> Will you visit me?<br> Truman?<br> It's him again.<br> It is utterly inappropriate for me<br> to talk to him.<br> Yes?<br> I'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.<br> - Hello?<br> - Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.<br> I just got this telegram. Has he seen it?<br> He won't read it.<br> - Would you put him on, please?<br> - Nelle, he won't talk.<br> Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down<br> and put the phone on his ear...<br> I need to speak to him.<br> All right.<br> It's Nelle.<br> Truman.<br> "Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.<br> "Sorry that Truman was unable to make it<br> here to the prison...<br> "for a brief word prior to necktie party.<br> "Whatever his reason for not showing up...<br> "I want him to know<br> that I cannot condemn him for it.<br> "Not much time left...<br> "but want you both to know<br> that I've been sincerely grateful...<br> "for your friendship through the years<br> and everything else.<br> "I'm not very good at these things.<br> "I have become extremely affectionate<br> toward you both. "<br> "But, harness time."<br> "Adios, amigos. Your friend, Perry."<br> Well, I didn't expect to see you again.<br> You can visit for a few minutes.<br> - Yeah.<br> - No.<br> Five minutes.<br> Well, well.<br> He returns.<br> I don't know what you must think of me.<br> Well, you haven't been foremost<br> on my mind lately...<br> as you can probably imagine.<br> You got the letter?<br> Yes, I did.<br> It's true.<br> I understand why you didn't want to come.<br> I wouldn't be here either if I didn't have to.<br> You got that right.<br> You know Ricardo donated his eyes<br> to science?<br> Next week, some blind man will be seeing<br> what Dick used to see.<br> Yeah, you could be walking in Denver<br> or somewhere, Truman...<br> and suddenly these eyes<br> will be staring at you.<br> That would be something, wouldn't it?<br> It would be. It would be.<br> You'll be watching?<br> I don't know, I'll be...<br> Do you want me to?<br> I'd like to have a friend there.<br> Okay. Then I will.<br> It's all right.<br> I did everything I could.<br> It's okay.<br> I truly did.<br> I know.<br> It's time.<br> Mr. Capote.<br> Goodbye.<br> You're not rid of us yet.<br> - We'll see you in a few minutes.<br> - I wish I had...<br> Mr. Capote.<br> - Mr. Capote.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Nice to see you.<br> Perry Edward Smith.<br> For the crime of murder in the first degree,<br> by order of the Court of Finney County...<br> and the Supreme Court<br> of the sovereign state of Kansas...<br> you are sentenced to hang until you die.<br> "I will fear no evil: For thou art with me.<br> "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."<br> You can say something if you want.<br> Is there anybody from the family here?<br> No, Perry.<br> Well, tell them...<br> I can't remember what I was gonna say<br> for the life of me.<br> Our Father who art in heaven,<br> Hallowed be thy name.<br> Thy kingdom come,<br> Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.<br> Give us this day our daily bread.<br> And forgive those who trespass against us.<br> And lead us not into temptation,<br> but deliver us from evil.<br> It was a terrible experience...<br> and I will never get over it.<br> They're dead, Truman. You're alive.<br> And there wasn't anything<br> I could have done to save them.<br> Maybe not...<br> but, the fact is, you didn't want to.<br>
