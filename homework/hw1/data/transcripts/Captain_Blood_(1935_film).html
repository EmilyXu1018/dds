                        Dr. Blood!<br> Who is it?<br> That we'll know better<br> when you've opened the door.<br> Me?<br> My mistake. After I've opened the door.<br> Open it, quick!<br> Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?<br> It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded<br> at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.<br> -The rash fool.<br> -He sent me for you. No time to lose.<br> Why, to be sure, I'll lose none,<br> nor my head either.<br> Come in and regain yours<br> while I get my things.<br> -I'll wait here.<br> -As you please.<br> Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.<br> Jeremy, how was the battle?<br> Battle? Slaughter, rather!<br> What can clubs do against cannon?<br> In case this business keeps me overlong,<br> take care you water my geraniums...<br> especially those<br> under the bedroom window.<br> Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up?<br> One would think you were still<br> at medical school.<br> Geraniums!<br> You would think of geraniums...<br> when every other able-bodied man<br> is out fighting.<br> It's out of favor I seem to be with you,<br> my vinegary virgin.<br> -Half the town is saying you're a papist.<br> -Why?<br> Because I have the sense to sleep tonight<br> instead of rushing to my ruin...<br> in an attempt to put<br> this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?<br> He'd be even worse than King James.<br> Make haste with that cloak there,<br> my pretty one.<br> And the other half of the town<br> that defends you...<br> claims that you're just a coward.<br> Mrs. Barlow, my darling,<br> you can tell them, if you like...<br> that I've been most anywhere<br> that fighting was in evidence.<br> Fought for the French against the Spanish,<br> and the Spanish against the French...<br> and I learned my seamanship<br> in the Dutch Navy.<br> But having had adventure enough<br> in six years to last me six lives...<br> I came here, hung up the sword,<br> and picked up the lancet.<br> Became a man of peace and not of war.<br> A healer, not a slayer...<br> and that I am going to be as long as<br> I'm on top of the sod and not under it.<br> -Will you be back for breakfast?<br> -Who knows, my pretty one?<br> The worst is done, my friend.<br> Give your mind peace.<br> The King's men!<br> There's nothing to fear.<br> This is a Christian country.<br> Christian men don't make war<br> on the wounded...<br> or those who shelter them.<br> I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons.<br> What rebels do you harbor?<br> No rebels. This wounded gentleman--<br> No need to ask<br> how he came by his wounds.<br> A rebel. Out with him.<br> This man can't be moved<br> without peril to his life.<br> Who the devil may you be?<br> Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.<br> Don't fling your French at me.<br> Latin, my dull friend.<br> It means I'm a doctor.<br> Or a liar.<br> If your wit were as big as your voice,<br> it's the great man you'd be for this.<br> You may find me great enough<br> to hang you!<br> Yes, I don't doubt it.<br> You've the looks and manners<br> of a hangman.<br> Take him away, and the others, too!<br> "ln the name of His Majesty,<br> Our Sovereign Lord...<br> "prisoners of the Crown,<br> you stand indicted...<br> "for having maliciously<br> and traitorously conspired...<br> "to change, alter, and wholly to subvert<br> the ancient government...<br> "of this Kingdom of England.<br> "Therefore, you are charged<br> with high treason...<br> "against the most illustrious<br> and most excellent...<br> "Prince James ll by the grace of God...<br> "of England, Scotland, France,<br> and lreland, King.<br> "Having no fear of God in your hearts...<br> "and being moved<br> and seduced by the devil...<br> "you have failed in the love<br> of due obedience toward the King...<br> "and have moved to disturb<br> the tranquility of the nation...<br> "and to stir up war to depose said king<br> from title...<br> "honor, and the regal name<br> of the imperial crown.<br> "Therefore, you are here to be tried<br> before His Majesty's Commissioner...<br> "the Lord Chief Justice,<br> Baron Jeffreys of Wem...<br> "and by a jury of 12 good men and true."<br> James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.<br> -Guilty or not guilty?<br> -Guilty.<br> -Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?<br> -Guilty.<br> -Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?<br> -Guilty.<br> -Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?<br> -Guilty.<br> -John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?<br> -Guilty.<br> Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?<br> Guilty. Praise the Lord.<br> Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?<br> Guilty.<br> -Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?<br> -Guilty.<br> Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?<br> It's entirely innocent, I am.<br> Take the stand and face His Lordship.<br> Are you guilty or not guilty?<br> You must use the right words.<br> Words, is it? Not guilty.<br> And speaking of words,<br> I'd like to say a few about the injustice...<br> of keeping an innocent man<br> locked up for three months...<br> in such filth and heat and ill-feeding<br> that my chief regret is I didn't try...<br> to pull down the filthy fellow<br> that sits on the throne.<br> Silence!<br> Are you entirely ignorant<br> of the proper procedure of the court?<br> Most happily ignorant up to now.<br> I could gladly have done<br> without this acquaintance.<br> Enough of this.<br> There is nothing more to be said,<br> except the passing of sentence.<br> May it please Your Lordship,<br> but there's a deal more to be said!<br> Silence!<br> -How now, fellow?<br> -There is the little matter of my defense.<br> Very well, then...<br> but in heaven's name, be brief, man.<br> We have much to do.<br> I am guilty of nothing, my lord...<br> unless it be adjudged a crime<br> that a man try to live peaceably.<br> Living peaceably<br> with the army of Monmouth?<br> I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.<br> I was arrested while engaging<br> in my profession as physician.<br> What's this?<br> You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?<br> And as such was summoned<br> to the aid of Lord Gildoy...<br> by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.<br> Master Pitt will testify.<br> He that is himself a confessed traitor.<br> -Is that your witness?<br> -There is also Andrew Baynes.<br> Master Baynes<br> will have enough testifying...<br> in a useless effort<br> to keep his own neck from the halter.<br> I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater,<br> the town where I live.<br> We've no time for all this.<br> If these other traitors<br> are as stubborn as you...<br> I may sit here till the next assizes.<br> Very well, then.<br> There's a witness I'll give you<br> that you can't deny:<br> yourself, sir.<br> For if I'm not physician,<br> how is it I know that you're a dying man?<br> The death to which you're dooming<br> hundreds of poor men daily...<br> in a frantic effort to send their souls<br> to perdition before your own...<br> is a light pleasantry...<br> compared to the bleeding death<br> in the lungs...<br> to which the great Judge<br> has condemned you.<br> Now, fellow,<br> we'll be done with the witnesses...<br> and I will convict you<br> out of your own rascally mouth.<br> When this Pitt came to summon you,<br> as you claim...<br> did you know you were called<br> to attend another rebel?<br> My business was with his wounds,<br> not his politics.<br> Did you know the law...<br> that any person who does<br> knowingly receive, harbor, comfort...<br> or succor a rebel<br> is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?<br> I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.<br> Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!<br> I thought it was to my fellow man.<br> It's a fearful thing<br> to send a man's soul to perdition...<br> but I am bound by my conscience...<br> and my love of my king to deal out justice.<br> Therefore, I instruct you,<br> gentlemen of the jury...<br> that inasmuch as Peter Blood<br> has admitted...<br> aiding a traitor to your king...<br> you do bring in a verdict of guilty...<br> that he may be hanged...<br> for the high treason he has committed.<br> What a creature must sit on the throne...<br> who lets a man like you<br> deal out his justice.<br> -Your Majesty.<br> -Sunderland, what brings you here?<br> These numerous hangings.<br> Splendid, aren't they?<br> We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.<br> Very true, Your Majesty...<br> but a foolish waste<br> of valuable human flesh.<br> How so?<br> Your Majesty's colonies in the West lndies<br> are urgently in need of slaves.<br> A healthy, vigorous man<br> can be reckoned worth from 10 to 20.<br> Splendid, Sunderland.<br> Send out word immediately that the King<br> is graciously pleased to command...<br> that all rebels convicted<br> but not yet hanged...<br> be gathered together...<br> and shipped by the first available boats<br> to the Americas.<br> Give us water!<br> There are men dying down here.<br> You'd think they'd take better care<br> of a valuable cargo like us.<br> Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal!<br> It's a truly royal clemency we're granted,<br> my friends...<br> one well worthy of King James.<br> He spares us the mercifully quick<br> extinction of the hangman's rope...<br> and gives us the slow death of slavery.<br> He grants us our lives<br> in exchange for a living death.<br> It's an uncertain world entirely.<br> "Be it known, men, that these prisoners<br> who stand before you...<br> "are now to be sold at a right<br> and fitting price.<br> "They may be put to labor<br> in the sulfur mines...<br> "or on the plantations<br> for a period of 10 years.<br> "And the parties<br> to whom they are assigned...<br> "must enter into security<br> for the proper punishment...<br> "of their offense."<br> His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.<br> Guards, attention! Present muskets.<br> Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it?<br> Or is it?<br> -Good day, Dixon.<br> -Good day, Governor.<br> I suppose we can begin this sale now,<br> Governor.<br> No, better wait for Col. Bishop.<br> He has the privilege<br> of being late for everything.<br> Yes, I know.<br> There he is.<br> -Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.<br> -Good afternoon, Governor.<br> Good afternoon, Miss Arabella.<br> How is my darling, the Governor,<br> and his foot?<br> Every day I think my gout<br> can't get any worse...<br> and every day it does.<br> My dear Colonel,<br> according to the King's request...<br> it is for you to take first choice<br> of this dainty nosegay...<br> and at your own price.<br> Egad, they're an appalling lot...<br> not likely to be of much value<br> on the plantation.<br> The less you want, the more for Dixon.<br> -Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.<br> -Buy them all?<br> To keep them out of Dixon's hands.<br> I perceive somebody's been talking<br> behind my back...<br> telling the truth.<br> -And you can joke.<br> -Arabella dear, don't be childish.<br> These men are rebels against their king.<br> They should be hanged, drawn,<br> and quartered.<br> -Any fate they meet is too good for them.<br> -Your uncle is right.<br> -Let the sale commence.<br> -My foot!<br> My dear, the law is the law,<br> and it's His Majesty's law...<br> and must be obeyed.<br> The best of the lot.<br> Open your mouth.<br> -20.<br> -Sold!<br> Sold to Col. Bishop for 20.<br> -As if he were buying horses.<br> -Yes, quite.<br> -Same price.<br> -This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot...<br> young and sturdy.<br> -Same price.<br> -Sold!<br> Sold to Col. Bishop for 20.<br> Quiet!<br> Open your mouth.<br> His pride has bought him a ticket<br> to Dixon's mines.<br> He isn't there yet.<br> -My dear, consider your social position!<br> -Uncle!<br> -Which one?<br> -That one.<br> -Him? I will not.<br> -But I want you to.<br> No. Let him cool his head<br> in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him.<br> -5.<br> -5? That's an insulting sum to offer.<br> -Does anyone offer more?<br> -6.<br> 7.<br> You're making an exhibition of yourself...<br> a girl like you,<br> bidding for a slave before these people.<br> -Will you buy him?<br> -Certainly not.<br> 8.<br> When a lady's interested in a man....<br> Calm down, Dixon,<br> 8 is nothing for such a man...<br> a skilled physician,<br> a gentleman, and a scholar.<br> -All right, 9.<br> -10!<br> It's apparent Miss Bishop wants him<br> more than I do.<br> Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for 10.<br> Sold!<br> 10, sold.<br> What would you like done with him,<br> Miss Bishop?<br> Why, I don't know.<br> You're extremely foolish.<br> It might have cost you your life.<br> It was fortunate for you<br> that I was here to save you.<br> I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought<br> by anyone by the name of Bishop.<br> You could learn a lesson in gratitude.<br> I could thank you for not interfering.<br> As it happens, you are hardly in a position<br> to have anything to say about it.<br> You may join the others belonging<br> to my uncle...<br> and henceforth you may take your orders<br> from him.<br> Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.<br> Come on. Move on, there.<br> Last night, this dog attempted to escape.<br> Today you'll see what happens<br> to those who forget...<br> that my friend King James<br> did you all a favor...<br> in saving you from your just fate<br> on the gallows.<br> Show them the iron, Kent.<br> F-T.<br> Whoever wears that brand<br> is known as a fugitive traitor...<br> and will be treated as such.<br> Burn those letters in your brain...<br> Iest they be burned on your hides, too.<br> There speaks a fit friend for King James<br> if ever I heard one.<br> Would I had him and his friend James<br> roasting on a spit over that fire.<br> Great would be the burning thereof<br> and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.<br> Do your duty!<br> What a cruel shame<br> that any man is made to suffer so.<br> -This beastly gout!<br> -Perhaps a new dressing will help.<br> Perhaps.<br> -I have it here.<br> -Put it down.<br> So sorry, Doctor.<br> Easy, you clumsy louts!<br> -We won't hurt you, Governor.<br> -You thick-fingered jackasses!<br> His Excellency will have his little joke.<br> Ill-begotten bunglers!<br> -Blundering pill peddlers!<br> -Your Excellency--<br> That is the final straw.<br> Out of this house...<br> and never let me see your faces again.<br> -But think of our reputations.<br> -Hang your reputations!<br> Leave me! I don't want to see you again!<br> Away! Out!<br> I don't want to see you!<br> Out into the streets!<br> Stop shouting.<br> You brought on my headache again.<br> Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch.<br> Easy, now. Help me up with my foot.<br> No remedy. Why, thank you, dear.<br> Why doesn't His Excellency<br> try another doctor?<br> Another doctor?<br> There are only those two<br> on this wretched island...<br> -and each one is worse than his partner.<br> -There is another.<br> And according to what I've heard,<br> he became a slave by being a doctor.<br> A slave?<br> Would you elevate a slave<br> to the position of doctor to the Governor?<br> -Is he a good doctor?<br> -I don't know.<br> Why are you laughing?<br> I'm just thinking how annoyed<br> Peter Blood would be...<br> if I did him another favor.<br> Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens<br> of this sovereign island...<br> who come before you with complaints.<br> Complaints, complaints.<br> Can none of my citizens<br> follow the example of their governor...<br> who endures the utmost agony<br> without a murmur?<br> -Easy there, fellow.<br> -Did I hurt you, sir?<br> No, but I thought you were going to.<br> Your Excellency,<br> this vagrant hides his sins...<br> behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.<br> -He's charged with being in debt.<br> -State your case, fellow, and no lies.<br> I was on the way to pay the butcher<br> on Tuesday...<br> as Honesty Nuttall is my name,<br> when I chanced on a poor old beggar.<br> It was Jones from the grog shop...<br> who begged me to have a drink with him.<br> Try standing on it, Your Honor.<br> Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible.<br> I remembered in time my poor<br> starving wife in need of the five bob.<br> What is this all about? Silence!<br> -Sit down.<br> -What's he here for?<br> For debt, Your Excellency,<br> and the prevaricator--<br> If it's for debt,<br> don't annoy me with such petty things.<br> Order him to work it off.<br> Work? Not that, anything but work.<br> What's your trade?<br> I'm a ship's carpenter<br> when the painful necessity arises.<br> Take him to work on the docks...<br> and don't you attempt to escape<br> till every farthing's paid...<br> or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!<br> Escape? How could a debtor escape<br> from this island...<br> even if he had a boat to do it with?<br> I couldn't escape any more<br> than a slave could escape.<br> I can walk.<br> Wonderful, my dear fellow.<br> Only two months' treatment,<br> and I'm a well man.<br> It's a miracle.<br> -The next complaint--<br> -Drat the next complaint. I can walk.<br> Come, Doctor.<br> You'll get your reward for this,<br> Peter Blood.<br> -From now on, you're my physician.<br> -Your Excellency is too kind.<br> Come back early tomorrow.<br> You're always welcome, Dr. Blood.<br> Hello.<br> Don't I know you?<br> A lady should know her own property.<br> -My property?<br> -Let me refresh your memory.<br> My name is Peter Blood,<br> and I'm worth precisely 10.<br> Forgive me for not recognizing you,<br> Dr. Blood.<br> You're so changed...<br> for the better.<br> The Governor tells me<br> I have you to thank for that.<br> You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.<br> Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life<br> when my friends are treated like animals?<br> It's they deserve your favors, not l.<br> They're all honest rebels.<br> I was snoring in my bed<br> while they were trying to free England...<br> from an unclean tyrant.<br> I believe you're talking treason.<br> I hope I'm not obscure.<br> -You could be flogged for that.<br> -No.<br> The Governor would never allow it.<br> He has the gout.<br> You depend upon that?<br> I intend to, for all it's worth,<br> and that promises to be considerable.<br> But you'd hardly know about that.<br> You've probably never had the gout.<br> -Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.<br> -Good afternoon.<br> -Another?<br> -What else is there to do...<br> ever since you ruined the Governor's foot<br> and our reputations with it?<br> -I ruined the Governor's foot?<br> -I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are--<br> -Someone coming.<br> -A patient?<br> A patient!<br> -I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry.<br> -It's all right.<br> Come in.<br> Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson.<br> -Dr. Whacker.<br> -Good afternoon.<br> How's business, my friends?<br> -Terrible.<br> -Good.<br> -Terribly good.<br> -That relieves me.<br> I had heard that things<br> were not altogether....<br> Idle gossip, obviously.<br> You intend to remain here?<br> Remain here? Why not?<br> It's queer.<br> There are you, free to come and go as<br> you please, and you choose to stay here.<br> While l, who hate this pestilential island....<br> Such are the quirks of circumstance.<br> I must be running along, gentlemen.<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> It's pleasant to see<br> everything so prosperous with you here.<br> -Not so hasty.<br> -Just a moment.<br> There's something I'd like to ask you.<br> Well, gentlemen?<br> Have you been thinking of leaving us,<br> Doctor?<br> Leaving? Now, Doctor.<br> How could a slave think of leaving?<br> Or even if he were fool enough to try,<br> by what means could he hope to escape?<br> And where, for example,<br> could he raise the few pounds necessary...<br> to purchase even a small boat?<br> -We might supply it.<br> -You?<br> -Now, gentlemen.<br> -Now, let's talk this thing over.<br> Now, if you'll just sit down here.<br> Now then, how much will you need?<br> 20 might buy a small wherry,<br> 10 more might equip it.<br> He's right.<br> -He means--<br> -You needn't tell me what he means.<br> I know two Christian gentlemen<br> when I see them.<br> Two men whose hearts are bleeding<br> for a brother doctor in distress.<br> But it's too much to ask,<br> too noble a gesture to hope for.<br> No, my good man, not at all.<br> But who would buy the boat?<br> We would not dare,<br> and you, a slave, you could not.<br> True.<br> That would be my part. To find someone.<br> A man as eager to escape as l.<br> -A man held here for debt, say.<br> -Then it's a bargain?<br> Gentlemen,<br> you've opened for me the gates of hope.<br> Doctor.<br> -My dear colleague.<br> -Gentlemen.<br> Now we have him.<br> We've only to get him involved<br> and reveal his plan.<br> He'll steal very little of our business<br> when he's in irons.<br> Gentlemen.<br> There's one thing slipped<br> my mind entirely.<br> Simple-minded men might think this<br> an opportunity for trickery...<br> but brilliant men like yourselves<br> will remember in what favor I stand...<br> with the Governor<br> in contrast to some others...<br> and how little their words<br> would weigh against mine.<br> Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> -Are you all with me?<br> -Yes.<br> Listen.<br> There's a man named Nuttall<br> who's in trouble with the Governor.<br> He's looking for a small boat<br> which he'll purchase...<br> on the night chosen for our escape.<br> -Escape?<br> -Quiet!<br> While he gathers stores and equipment,<br> we must be ready on the inside.<br> We might steal some sugarcane knives<br> and hack through the stockade walls.<br> Or dig our way under.<br> Once at sea, if we get there,<br> our troubles will have just begun.<br> If any of you want to withdraw,<br> now's the time.<br> -No.<br> -Not me.<br> You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match<br> your hearts against any other.<br> We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.<br> He was a ship's pilot.<br> Here's one you won't have to teach.<br> Six years in King James' Navy.<br> -What?<br> -That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner.<br> -A gunner?<br> -In the King's Navy, too.<br> I was always ashamed of it up to now.<br> We'll have a crew yet!<br> Any of you others<br> been keeping such secrets?<br> Where's Baynes?<br> -Where is he?<br> -He tried to escape today.<br> No! Caught?<br> -Branded?<br> -Yeah.<br> No!<br> Why did you do it, Andy?<br> I told you I'd try to get you out.<br> I couldn't stand it any longer.<br> I couldn't stand it.<br> I was going mad.<br> What do you think a man is made of?<br> How much do you think he can stand?<br> "Watchman, what of the night?"<br> lsaiah 21 :1 1.<br> Don't make the purchase<br> until well on in the evening.<br> That way there'll be less risk...<br> of anyone wondering where you came by<br> the money.<br> Lumme, Captain.<br> It ain't too late for us to change our minds.<br> Stow the provisions away on board<br> as soon as it's dark.<br> Then all you've got to do is sit down here<br> and wait for us.<br> Is that all?<br> Wait all alone in the blooming dark...<br> waiting for someone to come along<br> and nab me.<br> Nuttall, my lad,<br> there's just one other little thing.<br> Could you find me a good piece of timber<br> about so thick and so long?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> Then do so and lash it to your spine.<br> It needs stiffening.<br> Courage. I'll join you at midnight.<br> How long does it take to feed<br> this pack of dogs?<br> It's a wonder we make a profit at all.<br> You don't drive them hard enough.<br> Get them out of here!<br> I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.<br> It's tonight.<br> -At last!<br> -For heaven's sake, command yourself.<br> -Tonight, Hagthorpe.<br> -Caution above everything.<br> He who goes slowly, goes safely.<br> Remember, Jeremy,<br> you're the only navigator among us.<br> Without you, there's no escape.<br> Hello, Uncle!<br> Riding again? What do you plan to see<br> riding always the same road?<br> You'd be surprised what interesting things<br> there are to see on this island...<br> if you only keep your eyes open.<br> Today, for instance, I saw something<br> that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.<br> Stores and equipment<br> are all stowed away onboard.<br> We could use more food,<br> but there's no money left.<br> I'm not taking any chances<br> by asking our medical friends for more.<br> I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat<br> by midnight.<br> Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.<br> What the devil have you been up to?<br> Tonight will be a fine night,<br> judging by the sky.<br> There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up<br> and it should heal in a day or so.<br> Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir?<br> Yes. You, stop!<br> What's the matter? Why are you shaking?<br> Nothing. I....<br> What's going on between you two?<br> Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg.<br> I'll tend to you later.<br> Where have you been?<br> I've been at my work,<br> attending to the Governor.<br> You lie.<br> Do l?<br> The Governor's had another attack of gout.<br> He's been screaming for you<br> like a wounded horse all the afternoon.<br> Then it appears<br> I was not with the Governor.<br> Then where have you been?<br> -Why, I've been at....<br> -He was with me, Uncle.<br> What?<br> Thank you for protecting my reputation,<br> Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.<br> My uncle knows that I spend my time<br> with whomever I please.<br> You might choose your company<br> with better taste.<br> His Excellency's waiting for you!<br> Here, Kent, lend him your horse.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Otherwise, the lout will be all night<br> getting there.<br> Will I be required there long, sir?<br> You're afraid your work will interfere<br> with your social affairs?<br> If I get back late, before midnight,<br> could I get back into the stockade?<br> Will you stay here talking all night?<br> Be off with you!<br> Take him to the stockade!<br> Go on, get along in there.<br> If he talks, we're lost.<br> Well?<br> It seems that you're continually<br> doing me favors.<br> -I don't know why.<br> -Neither do l.<br> Yes, I do.<br> It's because you're so very grateful<br> and always thank me so prettily.<br> Sure now, you don't blame me<br> for resenting you and your favors.<br> This is interesting. I've had men tell me<br> they had reasons for admiring me...<br> and some have even laid claims<br> to reasons for loving me...<br> but for a man to store up reasons<br> for resenting me, how refreshing.<br> You must tell me a few of them.<br> The first is reason enough.<br> You bought me.<br> I've had no lack of experiences in my time,<br> but to be bought and sold was a new one.<br> I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.<br> That I can understand. Go on.<br> I've resented you because your name<br> is Bishop.<br> My thoughts have lumped you<br> with your uncle.<br> How was I to know<br> that a devil could have....<br> That a devil could have an angel<br> for a niece?<br> From a resentful man,<br> that is a pretty fair compliment.<br> Have you any more reasons<br> for resenting me like that one?<br> Indeed, I have. And the strongest of all...<br> I've resented you<br> because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.<br> Do you understand that?<br> I don't know.<br> Perhaps if you were to explain further, l....<br> I've already talked too much.<br> I'll open your mouth!<br> You'll stay here<br> without food or water until you talk.<br> -Why did you lie to your uncle?<br> -Because....<br> Dr. Blood,<br> you're a physician and should know.<br> Is it not considered unhealthy<br> for a slave to be seen at a boat?<br> -Why should it be?<br> -Boats put out to sea.<br> Slaves may not.<br> You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?<br> Am l?<br> The Governor will be waiting for you.<br> Yes.<br> Miss Bishop,<br> it's difficult for an lrishman to apologize.<br> But I hope you can forgive me<br> for having thought badly of you.<br> I will, if you tell me<br> how you think of me now.<br> How I think of you now? I think of you....<br> I think of you as the woman who owns me.<br> Her slave.<br> But I think the man is lucky<br> who can count you his friend.<br> I think you know you can.<br> Your slave is grateful<br> for all marks of favor.<br> When you forget your slavery<br> and go so far--<br> Now there, you're mistaken.<br> However far this slave may go,<br> he won't forget.<br> It's a characteristic we lrish<br> have in common with the elephants.<br> Hello. Where are you going?<br> You're so much improved,<br> I was returning to the stockade.<br> Don't leave me tonight. I'm a sick man.<br> I assure you, sir,<br> there's nothing more I can do.<br> There must be something.<br> Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.<br> Very well, then, if you wish it.<br> But mind, no more softness about this.<br> I'm gonna have you well by midnight<br> if I have to bleed you to death.<br> -Who goes there?<br> -Peter Blood.<br> -Jeremy, what's happened?<br> -Water.<br> Easy, lad.<br> I didn't tell him. I didn't.<br> -Tell him what, Jeremy?<br> -About our plans.<br> My back.<br> Help me.<br> -Who did this?<br> -Bishop.<br> Bishop. Swine!<br> I didn't tell him. I didn't.<br> -Is our boat still standing in at the bay?<br> -Yes, Jeremy.<br> I wondered if I was still out of my mind.<br> I've been seeing boats sailing in and out...<br> in and out, but ours will never sail.<br> Not now.<br> Or if it does, you'll sail without me.<br> What?<br> And get lost at sea without our navigator?<br> -Nonsense, lad.<br> -We are not going this time.<br> It's hopeless for all of us.<br> We'll manage somehow.<br> -What are you doing here?<br> -Doing?<br> Why, the duties of my office.<br> I said he was to have<br> no food nor drink till I ordered.<br> Sure now, I never heard you.<br> How could you? You weren't here.<br> Then how do you expect me<br> to know what orders you've given?<br> In the name of humanity!<br> If you know the word.<br> -You dare take that tone with me?<br> -Yes, I do!<br> I've been too soft with you...<br> but that shall be mended.<br> Kent, tie him up!<br> Had it easy here up to now. Get up there.<br> Now I'll take this rod to you...<br> until there's not an inch of hide left<br> on your dirty carcass.<br> Another beating?<br> This will be a good half-dozen of them<br> you've given me in promise.<br> This will be as real as it is overdue.<br> And what becomes of His Excellency<br> the Governor's gouty foot?<br> You'll not save yourself with that device<br> this time. Nothing will save you.<br> Pirates! Spanish pirates!<br> This is what I call a timely interruption.<br> Though what will come of it,<br> the devil himself only knows.<br> We've got to get through the town<br> to get to the boat.<br> Wait here, lads.<br> It's me. Mr. Nuttall.<br> You came close to being<br> the ex-Mr. Nuttall.<br> Wouldn't be the first death I died today.<br> We can't stay here waiting for them<br> to catch sight of us.<br> Let's get to the boat down this way.<br> Sunk to the bottom of the briny.<br> And it sunk our hopes with it.<br> -Perhaps not.<br> -What do you mean, Peter?<br> -He's gonna take a bath?<br> -Yes, but not for cleanliness.<br> Since the Spaniards have been<br> thoughtless enough to sink our craft...<br> I'll see if I can't persuade them<br> to lend us one of theirs.<br> Your Excellency,<br> facts are so often dull and deplorable.<br> Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you...<br> it is my painful duty to inform you<br> that 250 of my men...<br> are now complete masters<br> of the town of Port Royal.<br> Your most worthy islanders<br> have been disarmed...<br> and your city is now<br> absolutely in the hands...<br> of the forces of His Majesty<br> King Philip of Spain.<br> Now that you have our city,<br> what do you want with it?<br> For a price,<br> I could forebear reducing it to ashes.<br> -What price?<br> -200,000 pieces of eight.<br> That's why we waited till this morning<br> to put to sea.<br> We've a message for those Spaniards.<br> They are on their way now to receive it.<br> -Hagthorpe, man the guns!<br> -Clear deck!<br> -All ready, Hagthorpe?<br> -Aye, Peter, ready.<br> Give them a taste of their own iron!<br> You've done it, Hagthorpe!<br> Hurrah!<br> Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?<br> You did that,<br> you son of a Yorkshire steer...<br> and bless your rusty heart,<br> it's a gunner you are!<br> It's the Governor.<br> It must be that some brave party<br> of citizens captured the ship.<br> I think you're right.<br> Someone should go aboard<br> and congratulate them.<br> Yes. My foot.<br> Since your gout so unhappily<br> prevents you, allow me to be the one.<br> Go ahead. You've always wanted<br> to be governor anyway.<br> Don't be nervous.<br> -Man those sweeps.<br> -Aye, sir.<br> -Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?<br> -Aye. Get under way.<br> There's another boat approaching.<br> It looks like Col. Bishop.<br> -Who?<br> -Bishop.<br> The fool would come blundering<br> in just now.<br> -I'll make short work of him.<br> -No, Hagthorpe, none of that.<br> But.... Who....<br> Welcome aboard the Cinco Lagos,<br> Colonel darling.<br> You? Was it....<br> Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took<br> this ship and turned defeat into victory?<br> Myself it was. Myself and these,<br> my friends. And your friends.<br> And you saved my money, too!<br> -Yes, it was heroic.<br> -Heroic, is it?<br> It was epic.<br> You amaze me.<br> On my soul, you deserve well.<br> You all deserve well.<br> -You shall find me grateful.<br> -How grateful?<br> I shall ask His Excellency to write home<br> to the King an account of your exploit.<br> Perhaps some of your sentencing<br> shall be remitted.<br> That's just about<br> what we expected from you.<br> Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart.<br> -But what kind, I'd hate to say.<br> -What is this?<br> Why, Colonel darling,<br> such unusual generosity from you...<br> must be making you feel unwell.<br> -As your physician, I'd prescribe--<br> -A bit of neck-stretching.<br> Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.<br> -No?<br> -No.<br> Tie him over the end of a gun!<br> I'll scatter his innards<br> all over the sugarcane field.<br> You're wasting words, I say. Hang him!<br> Wait, lads. Hanging's too dignified for him.<br> Can you swim, Colonel darling?<br> We're giving you the chance to cool off<br> some of that excessive heat of yours.<br> Over the side with him, men!<br> One, two...<br> three!<br> Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this...<br> if I spend the rest of my life doing it!<br> And then the whale came,<br> and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope.<br> Goodbye, Jonah. Don't forget to write.<br> What's the next move, Peter?<br> Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar.<br> Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.<br> Thomas, get those men over here.<br> Round you go, men!<br> That's no water wheel you're working.<br> -Can you handle it, Jeremy?<br> -Aye, aye, Peter.<br> We sail. Hard to starboard.<br> Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!<br> There's no chains to hold you now!<br> Break out those sails...<br> and watch them fill with the wind<br> that's carrying us all to freedom.<br> We, the undersigned...<br> are men without a country...<br> outlaws in our own land,<br> and homeless outcasts in any other.<br> Desperate men,<br> we go to seek a desperate fortune.<br> Therefore, we do here and now<br> band ourselves...<br> into a brotherhood of buccaneers...<br> to practice the trade of piracy<br> on the high seas.<br> We, the hunted, will now hunt!<br> To that end, we enter into<br> the following articles of agreement.<br> First...<br> we pledge ourselves<br> to be bound together as brothers...<br> in a life-and-death friendship...<br> sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.<br> Second article.<br> All moneys and valuables<br> which may come into our possession...<br> shall be lumped together<br> into a common fund...<br> and from this fund<br> shall first be taken the money...<br> to fit, rig, and provision the ship.<br> After that, the recompense each<br> will receive who is wounded as follows:<br> For the loss of a right arm,<br> Left arm, 500.<br> For the loss of a right leg, 500.<br> Left leg, 400.<br> A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.<br> Greedy.<br> If a man conceal any treasure captured...<br> or fail to place it in the general fund,<br> he shall be marooned.<br> Set ashore on a deserted isle...<br> and there left with a bottle of water,<br> a loaf of bread...<br> and a pistol with one load.<br> If a man shall be drunk on duty,<br> he shall receive the same fate.<br> And if a man shall molest<br> a woman captive against her will...<br> he, too,<br> shall receive the same punishment.<br> These articles entered into,<br> this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.<br> Now, men, you've heard the agreement.<br> It's the world against us<br> and us against the world.<br> "His hand will be against every man,<br> and every man's hand against him."<br> Genesis 16:12.<br> Those of you in favor of these articles,<br> raise your right hands and say aye!<br> Aye!<br> Blood!<br> This impertinent,<br> ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.<br> Yes, Your Majesty.<br> Sinking Spanish ships<br> causes me enough embarrassment...<br> -but he sinks English ships as well.<br> -Yes, Your Majesty.<br> Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it?<br> He does his best,<br> but conditions on the island--<br> Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested<br> in anything you have to say.<br> I know your feelings towards me.<br> Sunderland, what are you Secretary<br> of State for? Have you no solution?<br> -Yes, Your Majesty.<br> -Get your head off that hinge. Speak up.<br> Since Gov. Steed is incapable,<br> you should appoint a stronger man.<br> Who?<br> Col. Bishop assures me<br> that if he were in power...<br> he would not rest day or night...<br> until this Capt. Blood<br> was swinging on execution dock.<br> Angling for the office, is he?<br> What difference<br> if he's the iron man we need?<br> Draw up the appointment.<br> I've already taken the liberty of doing so,<br> Your Majesty.<br> Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed,<br> I wish you both a pleasant journey.<br> I thank you, Governor.<br> Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop.<br> -May your term of office be successful.<br> -Thank you, my friend.<br> Arabella dear,<br> have a nice holiday in England.<br> I'm sure I shall.<br> -Captain.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -Keep a weather eye open for pirates.<br> -Very well, sir.<br> Before you return, Arabella,<br> I shall have the sea swept clean of them.<br> Particularly one.<br> I think you know whom I mean.<br> I hope he gets the gout<br> the infernal office gave me.<br> Come along. Goodbye.<br> Thomas Fulton. One share, no injuries.<br> James Graham. One share,<br> plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.<br> Zachary Stevens.<br> For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo...<br> one share, plus 10 of silver.<br> Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces<br> of eight for the loss of his left leg.<br> There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you.<br> Lord Chester Dyke.<br> No injury, one share and 5 of silver.<br> Anton Brazilimo.<br> Andrew Fell.<br> One share, plus 500 pieces of eight<br> for the loss of his left arm.<br> There you are, Andrew, and good luck.<br> David Sampson. One share, no injuries.<br> Honesty Nuttall. No injuries, one share.<br> Hold on, Captain.<br> How about me little toe,<br> heroically sacrificed in battle?<br> Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing<br> for the toe he just shot off himself.<br> You stupid numskull.<br> You should have shot out your brains<br> and left your toe for thinking with.<br> Ahoy, the deck!<br> An English ship on the port bow!<br> So it is.<br> A fine big ship, too,<br> as far as I can judge from this distance.<br> Shall we sail over<br> and give them a surprise?<br> No, Peter.<br> The men are set on putting in at Tortuga.<br> Their gold's burning holes in their pockets.<br> What's one ship more or less to us now?<br> It appears I have a mutiny on my hands.<br> What ho, the deck! A ship to starboard!<br> It may be a pirate!<br> Very well, then.<br> Sail on, little ship, back to England...<br> where we may never go.<br> You'll never know<br> how close you came to not getting there.<br> Your turn, mon capitaine.<br> Up!<br> It's your turn now.<br> Again, my captain.<br> -Are you ready?<br> -Right.<br> It's good.<br> This time, my friend, huh?<br> -You missed.<br> -No.<br> I am defeated.<br> You win the prize, Capt. Blood.<br> -Goodbye, my dear.<br> -Goodbye.<br> What a charming captain.<br> Some other time, perhaps.<br> Why?<br> What sort of a man are you?<br> I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.<br> A man with money.<br> The money!<br> Mon capitaine,<br> what a pair we would make.<br> In all the Caribbean,<br> there is no buccaneer so strong as me.<br> Except you.<br> You almost flatter me, Levasseur.<br> Why do you hold off your consent so long?<br> We become partners.<br> You've been in Tortuga<br> these three, four months.<br> You must be even so much<br> in need of gold as l.<br> Such a partnership requires sober thought.<br> My poor head has been dancing with rum<br> this whole week past.<br> Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest<br> this side the Caribbean.<br> With your brain and my strength,<br> there is nothing we cannot do.<br> There's very little I can't do all by myself.<br> Long live Capt. Levasseur!<br> And here's to Capt. Blood!<br> Hurrah!<br> Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.<br> -You're next, Peter.<br> -Mon capitaine.<br> It's clearly understood, then,<br> that we sail under my articles.<br> Those very severe articles of yours?<br> Mais oui, I sail under the articles<br> of a girls' sminaire...<br> to have you as my partner, mon capitaine.<br> Women will be the death of you yet,<br> Levasseur.<br> It is a very pleasant way to die,<br> even if it is expensive.<br> What is the first order,<br> mon capitaine partner?<br> We sail on the tide.<br> Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.<br> Each ship will proceed singly to pick up<br> any stray ships we'll find on the journey.<br> We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.<br> Magnifique!<br> I give you the toast. To our great success!<br> Let me give one.<br> To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!<br> -Oui!To Capitaine Levasseur!<br> -Capt. Blood.<br> Bravo!<br> The articles aside,<br> let's give a toast to Capt. Blood.<br> Capitaine Levasseur.<br> To the greatest captain on the coast.<br> The greatest captain on the coast, is it?<br> Methinks the greatest captain<br> on the coast...<br> has just made the greatest mistake...<br> the most ordinary common fool<br> could make.<br> It's been so lovely. I'd like to stay forever.<br> You've all been so kind.<br> Come again and visit us soon, dear.<br> England is so much more beautiful<br> when you're here.<br> -Thank you. Goodbye.<br> -Goodbye.<br> -Thank you for everything.<br> -Goodbye, dear.<br> -Goodbye, Amelia.<br> -Goodbye, Mary.<br> However else the court may have changed,<br> the art of flattery still flourishes.<br> Stab me if it's flattery.<br> When the King ordered me on this journey<br> as a special emissary to the West lndies...<br> I looked forward with some trepidation<br> to a life among the savages.<br> But when I found<br> you were one of those savages...<br> returning to your native heath,<br> my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.<br> You pictured us running around<br> in animal skins, eating raw meat?<br> Why not, in a country filled<br> with lndians and pirates?<br> Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen<br> to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?<br> -Peter Blood?<br> -Yes.<br> No. I don't know him.<br> I hardly number pirates<br> among my acquaintances.<br> Of course not. Stupid of me.<br> I merely mention him in passing.<br> Because he's one of the objects<br> of my mission.<br> -Your mission?<br> -Yes.<br> I've been sent to try to blot out<br> all this piracy, my dear.<br> And in a manner<br> I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood.<br> Ship on the port side, sir!<br> Yes, that's a fine ship.<br> -Captain, what ship is that?<br> -I don't know, Lord Willoughby.<br> She flies the French flag.<br> She could be anything in these waters.<br> -We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?<br> -Yes, we are.<br> Yonder bank of low clouds<br> is the island of Virgen Magra.<br> -Exciting, isn't it?<br> -Very.<br> Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance?<br> Any ship we meet in the Caribbean<br> could be a pirate ship.<br> Ahoy, English ship off port side!<br> Prepare to come onto starboard tack!<br> Starboard tack it is!<br> Steady at the helm!<br> Ready?<br> Stand by your guns.<br> What luck.<br> Just as I'm about to give up and anchor<br> to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood...<br> this fine English prize<br> walks into my parlor and says:<br> "Hello, Capt. Levasseur. "<br> -We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.<br> -Yes, and how. Light it!<br> The ransom for you two is fixed at<br> I shall provide a boat for you...<br> to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica<br> to collect it.<br> Meanwhile, mademoiselle remains<br> with me as hostage.<br> I find it very lonely on this island.<br> I refuse absolutely and utterly!<br> You know this? It is the rosary of pain.<br> It is possible to screw a man's eyes<br> out of his head.<br> Very well. Do your worst.<br> Alors!<br> No, stop!<br> Lord Willoughby, thank you,<br> but don't be foolish.<br> Mademoiselle is right.<br> Thank you, miss.<br> I beg you to spare yourself<br> and the young lady.<br> You know,<br> I've been too modest with you...<br> but since I have said<br> eh bien, I have said 20,000 pieces of eight.<br> For what, if you please,<br> have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?<br> If it ain't the niece<br> of our old friend Col. Bishop.<br> You don't recognize her. Mind that.<br> What does he mean?<br> Your guess is as good as mine.<br> -Good morning, Levasseur.<br> -Hello, Captain.<br> -Cahusac.<br> -Capitaine.<br> I arrived late last night and put into a cove<br> a few miles to the west.<br> We've walked across<br> to give you good morning, but, faith...<br> it seems we've interrupted<br> some business of yours.<br> -Who are these people?<br> -Oh, yes, here.<br> As you see, two prisoners.<br> I captured an English ship.<br> Yes. We saw her coming across the spit.<br> I must congratulate you, Levasseur.<br> I didn't so much as sight a sail.<br> The fortunes of war, my partner.<br> And these are also the fortunes of war?<br> Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece<br> of the Governor of Jamaica.<br> Really?<br> I suppose congratulations<br> are again in order...<br> but have you forgotten there's an article<br> in our agreement...<br> forbidding the taking of women prisoners?<br> That's a foolish article of yours.<br> I was not aware you regarded it so<br> when we signed.<br> Would you care to dispute<br> my opinion now, your men against mine?<br> Not this morning, thank you.<br> As you say, a foolish article.<br> Heard, my friend.<br> That is why these are prisoners<br> of my own, a matter personal.<br> -And the 20,000 pieces of eight?<br> -Their ransom.<br> -That is also a personal matter?<br> -It is.<br> Obviously, these two prisoners,<br> and particularly the young lady...<br> must be kept in someone's hands for,<br> shall we say, safekeeping...<br> but why your hands?<br> Why shouldn't Pierre have her,<br> or Roch, or Jacob...<br> since she's as much their property<br> as yours?<br> Or doesn't that please you?<br> You'd like to keep her for yourself.<br> And who might that be, do you suppose?<br> -That is your Capt. Blood.<br> -Capt. Blood?<br> Now, my captain...<br> since you covet our joint property<br> of war, you may have her...<br> providing you're willing to buy her.<br> -Buy her?<br> -At the price you yourself have put on her.<br> The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop.<br> It is for division when it comes.<br> But if the Governor should refuse to pay<br> the ransom, what then?<br> No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile,<br> pay the ransom.<br> Let it be your risk to collect it<br> from the Governor.<br> Capt. Blood is right.<br> -It's in the articles.<br> -What's in the articles, you fools?<br> Where do you suppose<br> I have 20,000 pieces of eight?<br> -Let someone buy her who has.<br> -Who?<br> -I.<br> -You?<br> Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.<br> Here they are, Peter.<br> I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.<br> Can you improve on that, Levasseur?<br> I don't wish to be bought by you.<br> As a lady once said to a slave...<br> you are hardly in a position<br> to have anything to say about it.<br> -You want the girl?<br> -Why not?<br> And I'm willing to pay for what I want.<br> Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.<br> At what do you value each of those?<br> They're worth rather more, but very well.<br> Here are 12.<br> The three-fifths the value of the prize<br> due your ship for having made the capture.<br> For the share due my men,<br> I make myself responsible.<br> Now, Wolf, will you be so kind<br> as to take my property aboard ship?<br> And that settles that, my captain partner.<br> -No, you don't!<br> -Stop, Capitaine!<br> Wait! You'll not take her while I live!<br> Then I'll take her when you're dead!<br> -Capitaine, it has been honorably settled.<br> -It has not been settled for me!<br> What is a girl, more or less?<br> Do not be a fool, Capitaine!<br> It's my business.<br> Two breaches in our articles committed<br> by you. You should be marooned.<br> It's what I intended for you in the end...<br> but since you prefer it this way,<br> you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.<br> Up!<br> And that, my friend, ends a partnership<br> that should never have begun.<br> All these things I've gathered<br> in my journeys.<br> I've gone far since I was a slave<br> on your uncle's plantation...<br> thousands of restless, hectic miles.<br> But somehow tonight,<br> I've got a strange feeling...<br> that my journey's almost over.<br> You see these ankle rings?<br> They came from a ship<br> that was out from Persia.<br> And these pearls...<br> they're the choice from a fleet<br> we captured off the Azores.<br> -Have you ever seen such pearls?<br> -Yes, I have.<br> They're like the pearls you sometimes<br> use for making purchases, are they not?<br> -Yes, they are.<br> -How many lives did they cost?<br> As few as possible.<br> It wasn't lives I was after.<br> -What, then?<br> -I never quite knew.<br> Some urge that drove me on.<br> Revenge, I suppose.<br> But I've had my fill of revenge.<br> I often wondered<br> why I bothered to save all these things.<br> Tonight I know it's because...<br> one day you'd be here in this cabin<br> to wear them.<br> I'll never wear them, never!<br> Those nor any other plunder gotten<br> by a thief and pirate.<br> Thief and pirate.<br> I've seen your pirate ways.<br> I've seen myself bargained for<br> and fought over.<br> A combat between jackals.<br> But I thought you understood.<br> You mean you thought you'd bought me.<br> I suppose I should have regarded that<br> as a compliment.<br> You pirates are used to taking<br> without the formality of purchase.<br> I advise you to go back to your ladies<br> at Tortuga...<br> who are thrilled by your bold,<br> lawless ways.<br> I only hate you and despise you.<br> I might have expected your thanks<br> for what I've done this day...<br> but very well, let it be so.<br> I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you<br> how a thief and a pirate can deal.<br> Once, you bought me for a miserable 10.<br> Now I've bought you for considerably<br> more. The amount's of no matter.<br> What matters is<br> now I own you as you once owned me.<br> You're mine, do you understand?<br> Mine to do with as I please!<br> Capt. Blood,<br> Lord Willoughby sends his compliments...<br> and requests you to talk with him<br> at your convenience.<br> He's been sent by the King himself.<br> Tell him I'm not convenient<br> to any friend of the King's.<br> All I've got to say is good riddance...<br> as soon as I can get him to his destination.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Jeremy. Wolverstone.<br> -Wolverstone!<br> -What is it, Peter?<br> We're changing course.<br> Draw down every rag of canvas<br> the yards will hold.<br> -Aye, aye, Peter, but....<br> -Jeremy!<br> All hands on deck!<br> -Jeremy!<br> -Coming, Peter!<br> Forever sleeping when I need you?<br> -I wasn't sleeping. I was--<br> -Never mind! Get ready to go about.<br> -Set the course for Port Royal.<br> -Port Royal?<br> But the English fleet is at Port Royal.<br> Col. Bishop--<br> Sweet, merciful heaven! Haven't you ears?<br> Set the course for Port Royal!<br> -Make speed there, Wolverstone.<br> -Speed it is, Peter.<br> -Follow we a helm, west by north.<br> -West by north, sir.<br> Make speed there! To your halyards!<br> Tacks and braces. We head for Port Royal.<br> Make speed there! That's the order!<br> Make speed there.<br> There's a gallows waiting<br> for each of us at Port Royal...<br> and no man should be late<br> to his own hanging.<br> How you hate the villain.<br> If I were a young man,<br> I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.<br> But you said you didn't even know him.<br> He was once my slave.<br> Slave?<br> Did you know him well?<br> I did.<br> He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate.<br> When he made his escape,<br> I was thrilled and happy.<br> That was before I knew how he would use<br> his freedom.<br> But aren't you forgetting...<br> that a man's bitter heart<br> may demand revenge?<br> That is the unforgivable thing:<br> to have put his revenge above<br> everything else...<br> and to have destroyed himself.<br> That's what he's done.<br> I've seen pirates. I know their ways.<br> Cruel, evil, greedy,<br> plundering peaceful cities...<br> torturing their captives. Beasts.<br> Are you so much in love with him?<br> In love with him?<br> That you care so much what he does?<br> I don't care in the least what he does.<br> Someone should,<br> in view of what he's doing now.<br> But your uncle's with the fleet<br> at Port Royal. That much is fortunate.<br> Why? What's this about my uncle<br> in Port Royal?<br> He amazes me, this fellow.<br> That's where he means to take us.<br> -No, he can't.<br> -They won't let me near him.<br> He's alone on his quarterdeck<br> in a fine lrish temper, I suspect.<br> -But I learned of it from one of the crew.<br> -Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.<br> My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.<br> He lives in the hope of one day<br> taking and hanging Capt. Blood.<br> Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that,<br> of course.<br> I doubt if it'd make any difference if he did.<br> He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.<br> Chivalrous?<br> And yet he's been what he's been<br> these last three years...<br> and done what he's done.<br> Lord Willoughby, help me.<br> I see your point, my child...<br> but that's something<br> you must decide for yourself.<br> Life can be infernally complex.<br> It's hard to lay tongue to the right words.<br> I'll lay tongue to them.<br> We won't sail to Jamaica.<br> Them's the words.<br> Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.<br> When you risked your neck in a duel<br> over that petticoat...<br> that was your business.<br> But it's our necks you're risking now,<br> and I say no.<br> Not for her, nor a dozen like her.<br> I got a great affection for my neck.<br> I have no wish to hear it cracked<br> by a hangman's knot.<br> This is what comes from sailing the seas<br> with a lovesick madman.<br> We've been with you since the first, Peter.<br> We have a right.<br> You, too, Jeremy?<br> All right, lads.<br> What do you mean, Peter?<br> You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.<br> There's nothing more to be said.<br> -Hurrah for our side!<br> -Quiet. You sound like a rooster.<br> Good night, lads.<br> Wait a minute, Peter.<br> Where are we sailing for?<br> That's for you to tell me...<br> since I'm no longer running this ship.<br> We didn't say that, Peter.<br> As Jeremy says, you've got the right.<br> You've been with me from the first,<br> and you've been loyal and true...<br> followed me into every tight corner<br> men could follow another.<br> -But you always got us out.<br> -And none the poorer for it.<br> Yes, but on this occasion,<br> there's no gold to be got.<br> Do you think it was<br> for gold we followed you?<br> No, but I can see now I've not got<br> the right to ask you to follow me.<br> The girl is my concern, not yours.<br> Are we gonna stand by and see<br> this little snip laugh at our captain?<br> There's Bishop's fleet.<br> That might be paying a high price<br> to keep from being laughed at.<br> We're not yet such lily-Iivered scum<br> as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.<br> No. That is, not very afraid.<br> Fie on you deserting our captain<br> in this way...<br> you scurvy traitors, you Judas lscariots,<br> you snakes in the grass...<br> you wolves in sheep's clothing!<br> I was only with them to spy on them.<br> You'd better think carefully, lads.<br> Yonder lies Jamaica,<br> and straight we sail for it.<br> -Aye. And straight we sail for it.<br> -Aye!<br> -Ahoy, the deck!<br> -Ahoy!<br> I have sighted Port Royal!<br> Aye! Port Royal, you say?<br> Aye, sir!<br> There's something amiss!<br> I see flashes of gunfire<br> from ships in the harbor!<br> -Fetch the Captain.<br> -Aye, sir.<br> Bugler, all hands on deck!<br> It's terrible to wake up at dawn<br> dreaming of thunder.<br> That's gunfire if I ever heard any.<br> -There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.<br> -How many ships do you make out?<br> It's hard to see clearly in the early<br> morning light. I think there are two.<br> It's an attack on Port Royal, but who?<br> Pirate craft, perhaps.<br> Wish I could make out their flags.<br> -Perhaps I can supply you the answer.<br> -You can?<br> Yes, if I may speak to<br> so inaccessible a person.<br> If Port Royal is being attacked,<br> they are likely French ships.<br> French?<br> You say Port Royal's attacked<br> by the French? Why?<br> When two countries are at war<br> and one is attacked...<br> who would it be but the enemy?<br> What's this? France and England at war?<br> You mean you don't know? Where have<br> you been the past few months?<br> At sea, out of touch with the world.<br> The fire from the fortress is weakening!<br> One ship is already firing on the town!<br> That's strange.<br> Where is the English fleet<br> that's supposed to protect the town?<br> It's my turn to supply the answer.<br> It's out chasing pirates.<br> Bishop would never let his fleet leave its<br> post in time of war. He wouldn't dare.<br> Col. Bishop, if I may say,<br> is a very old and dear friend of mine.<br> -It's probably me he's after.<br> -That fool! Blunder!<br> And me in his own front yard.<br> Shorten sail there, Wolf.<br> Lend a hand forward, Andy.<br> Stand by helm and keep her headed<br> two points to larboard of the fort.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Get your men to their stations, Chester.<br> Port watch to stations!<br> Speed there, lads!<br> -Reef the fore topsail!<br> -Aye, aye, sir!<br> Take in the topgallant sail.<br> May I ask, Captain,<br> what are your intentions?<br> Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you<br> at Port Royal, but now....<br> Miss Bishop,<br> an unlooked-for circumstance...<br> prevents my landing you<br> on your own dock.<br> But I trust that if I put you ashore<br> on the beach nearby...<br> that would be equally satisfactory?<br> -I--<br> -Thank you.<br> Only please understand, this is a bargain...<br> your freedom for my freedom.<br> From now on,<br> I no longer regard myself as a slave.<br> My life's my own...<br> even though I'm a thief and pirate.<br> Capt. Blood, are you,<br> an Englishman, thinking of leaving...<br> when yonder,<br> an English town is being taken?<br> Hagthorpe,<br> clear my deck and keep it cleared.<br> -Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.<br> -Take your hands off!<br> -Wait, lads.<br> -Capt. Blood, I must talk to you.<br> Very well then, Lord Willoughby.<br> Myself, I've the honor to be lrish,<br> but part of my crew's English.<br> I was myself once, too, in loyalty.<br> Of what should we be thinking?<br> Of the chance to fight for your king.<br> To fight for my king?<br> Yes. He was loyal enough<br> to send me to seek you out...<br> to offer you pardon for your past crimes...<br> freedom from your slavery<br> and more than that...<br> a commission in his own navy<br> for you and your men.<br> You hear that, Chester?<br> The King wants us to join his navy!<br> Read it for yourself.<br> Lord Willoughby,<br> you're a guest aboard my ship...<br> and I've still some notion left me<br> from better days of decent behavior...<br> so I'll not be telling you<br> what I think of this offer.<br> All I'll say is,<br> I wouldn't soil my hands with it...<br> even though they're the hands<br> of a thief and a pirate.<br> But this concerns you, too, my lads.<br> What do you say to serving the King?<br> No!<br> I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie.<br> I'd rot before I'd serve him.<br> I'd sink this ship with all hands<br> before I'd serve him.<br> It would appear then<br> that my crew is still a little dubious...<br> as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.<br> However you hate the King,<br> England is still England.<br> And a bad king is bad king,<br> and worse one if he's James.<br> James?<br> This commission is sent by King William.<br> King William? Who may King William be<br> and what's he king of?<br> I'm alluding to His Majesty,<br> King William lll, William of Orange...<br> who, with Queen Mary,<br> has come over from the Netherlands...<br> and has been ruling England<br> the past two months or more.<br> They've roused themselves at home<br> and kicked out that pimple James?<br> Yes, and he's fled to France<br> and he's in hiding there...<br> and England and France are at war.<br> The English people will go so far,<br> Capt. Blood...<br> and then they get up<br> on their stubborn hind legs.<br> -And William sent us this commission?<br> -Yes.<br> He knows you're good men,<br> wrongfully sold into slavery.<br> He can use good men in his navy.<br> It's the long-winded fellow you are.<br> Why didn't you tell us this<br> in the first place?<br> Bugler, summon the men amidships!<br> Men!<br> I've just heard a startling piece of news.<br> King James is kicked out of England<br> and good King William reigns in his stead.<br> For me,<br> this changes the shape of the world.<br> For you who were slaves with me...<br> it means that we're no longer slaves.<br> That we once more have<br> a home and a country.<br> For you who are English...<br> it means a chance to fight<br> for your native land...<br> for I now propose to sail into Port Royal<br> and take it from the French!<br> Those of you who are not English...<br> will have to be content<br> with fighting for Capt. Blood...<br> and the loot you'll find<br> on the French ships.<br> -Are you willing to fight, men?<br> -Aye!<br> Have we an English battle flag on board,<br> Hagthorpe?<br> We have every manner of battle flag,<br> including a lady's purple petticoat.<br> Wait, I've a better idea.<br> When an English lion creeps up<br> on a nest of French foxes...<br> he wears a bushy tail.<br> Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.<br> Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.<br> Stand by the helm, Jeremy.<br> Forward, men, to your stations.<br> -Is that satisfactory to you?<br> -Perfectly.<br> Clear decks for action!<br> Capt. Blood's orders.<br> You'll be put ashore with these men.<br> A ship is no place for a woman<br> in time of battle.<br> -I want to talk to him.<br> -I'm sorry. The Captain's busy.<br> -Into the boat.<br> -Aye, sir.<br> Follow me, Miss Bishop.<br> Musketeers, to your stations!<br> A French ship.<br> Hope we get on them<br> before they discover the trick.<br> -Andy.<br> -Aye, Peter.<br> Run to Hagthorpe.<br> Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.<br> -Put them by the guns.<br> -Hot coals, sir?<br> -No questions. Run.<br> -Aye, aye, sir!<br> Stand by ready to fire as soon as<br> we come amidships.<br> Stand ready to fire<br> as soon as we've come amidships!<br> Open your ports!<br> Strike that French flag<br> and hoist our own colors.<br> Man your port guns!<br> Ready, Hagthorpe?<br> Fire!<br> Hagthorpe,<br> give them the hot galley broadside!<br> Aye, Peter! Load them, lads!<br> Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!<br> We never miss.<br> -That's one ship neatly disposed of.<br> -Now for the other one.<br> -Jeremy, helm quarter to port.<br> -Aye, aye, Peter.<br> Clear away that burning wreckage!<br> -Port guns, Wolf. Hurry.<br> -Aye, Peter.<br> Man your port guns!<br> Those French gunners<br> must've learnt their trade in England.<br> That's their third direct hit.<br> Two guns out of order.<br> Ship's taking water below.<br> Replace them with two<br> from the starboard side.<br> -Keep hammering that waterline.<br> -Aye, aye, sir.<br> Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.<br> What should we do?<br> Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking.<br> Get your men forward.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> -What now, Peter?<br> -Take the helm yourself, lad.<br> Straight into them!<br> -We'll never do it, Peter!<br> -Musketeers to the prow!<br> Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward<br> gunners, fire as hard as they can load!<br> Rapid fire, men!<br> Hagthorpe, double them up!<br> They won't take it, Peter!<br> They're blazing hot!<br> Up into the shrouds, men!<br> We're going to swing across on ropes.<br> When we clear the rail,<br> come over the side!<br> Aye, aye, Peter!<br> You and your men swing across<br> into their rigging.<br> When you see me cut down<br> that French flag, drop down.<br> Up, men, into the shrouds!<br> Strong and sure! Grapnels over!<br> All right, my hearties, follow me!<br> Follow on, men!<br> "Dust thou art,<br> and unto dust thou shalt return."<br> "Love thy neighbor as thyself."<br> Leviticus 19:18.<br> -Hurry, Cato. We'll be late.<br> -Yes. The fleet's in already.<br> -Stop!<br> -Yes.<br> Capt. Blood!<br> Miss Bishop.<br> I'll be on the veranda.<br> I thought you'd gone.<br> You can't be here.<br> My uncle's just returned.<br> -Yes, I know.<br> -You know?<br> -What are you going to do?<br> -Just stay here.<br> No, it's impossible. You mustn't stay here.<br> -He's sworn he'll hang you.<br> -I doubt he will.<br> I've always been bad luck for your uncle.<br> You can't know the threats he's made.<br> The dreadful threats he's made.<br> His whole life is spent<br> in searching for you.<br> -Now he's found me.<br> -But you can still save yourself.<br> Please, for my sake.<br> For your sake? What do you mean for your<br> sake? Isn't it true that you hate me?<br> -Hate you?<br> -Or is it that you love me?<br> I'll hide you.<br> And tonight after dark, I'll find some way--<br> You love me, don't you?<br> Whom else would I love? Now will you?<br> You love me!<br> Lord Willoughby, she loves me!<br> He'll be here any minute.<br> I'll hide you somewhere.<br> We'll hide together. I know just the place.<br> How's this?<br> You must be mad. He'll come here first.<br> Good. I forgot to tell you.<br> The Governor and I are<br> on the best of terms.<br> He lets me come and go here<br> as I please. Look.<br> -You can't arrest me!<br> -I have, by order of the Governor.<br> The Governor? You are mad.<br> I am the governor.<br> You mean, you were the governor.<br> But we've changed that in your absence.<br> What?<br> You're broken for abandoning your post<br> in time of war.<br> Who are you?<br> My name is Willoughby. I'm a special<br> emissary of His Majesty the King.<br> Lord Willoughby?<br> -You were informed, I think, of my coming.<br> -Yes.<br> Yet you went off<br> on some wild goose chase after a pirate...<br> Ieaving your capital at the mercy<br> of the enemy.<br> Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter,<br> as you may well find.<br> Seeing that you hold your office<br> from James...<br> it's even possible the charge of treason<br> lies against you.<br> But, my lord--<br> I'm not concerned to hear<br> your reasons, man.<br> -His Excellency the Governor will.<br> -The Governor?<br> You'll find him inside.<br> It rests entirely with him<br> whether you're hanged or not.<br> This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.<br> What a reckoning<br> there'll be when we meet.<br> Have mercy, Your Excellency!<br> -Arabella, why are you here?<br> -Uncle!<br> I have been pleading<br> with the Governor on your behalf...<br> asking him to be as merciful<br> as you would be cruel.<br> Uncle, this is the Governor.<br> Good morning, Uncle.<br> English<br>
