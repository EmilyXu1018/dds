We're going<br> to have to call your mom.<br> What?<br> We're going to have to<br> call your mother, Carrie.<br> I know she's had<br> problems with us in the past,<br> ever since the state stopped her from<br> homeschooling you anymore,<br> but we've got to bring<br> her into this, okay?<br> Mmm-mmm. No.<br> Sweetie, we have no choice.<br> - We have to tell your mom what happened.<br> - No.<br> Carrie.<br> Hey. Hey, You.<br> Tina, give it to me. Give it here.<br> This is brilliant. Look at this video.<br> Plug it up!<br> She got her period.

Say it.<br> - No, Mama.<br> - Say it.<br> - Talk to me.<br> - Please just talk to me.<br> - And Eve was weak.<br> I just want you to talk to me.<br> And the first sin was<br> the sin of intercourse.<br> And the first sin was<br> the sin of intercourse.<br> Why didn't you tell me, Mama?<br> And God visited Eve with a curse.<br> And the curse was a curse of blood.<br> I'm not going to say that.<br> That's not even in the Bible.<br> it doesn't say that anywhere.<br> Oh, Lord. Help this little girl<br> see the sin of her days and ways.<br> Show her if she had remained innocent,<br> the curse of blood would<br> not have come upon her as it did on Eve.<br> I'm not Eve, Mama. I didn't sin.<br> You showered with those other girls.<br> You had lust-filled thoughts.<br> Everyone has to shower, Mama.<br> Everyone. That's just the rules.<br> You must be different,<br> because He can see you.<br> I don't want to be different, Mama.<br> I want to be like them.<br> He can smell the sin on you.<br> And He will punish you.<br> I will not let that<br> come down upon you. I will not.<br> Lord have mercy.<br> No. "The Lord is good.<br> His unfailing love endures forever,<br> "and his faithfulness continues<br> through all generations."<br> Psalms 100, verse 5.<br> I'm going to keep you<br> away from that school.<br> - You can't.<br> - We'll pray. We'll pray together.<br> To save our women-weak,<br> wicked, sinning souls.<br> You didn't tell me and they laughed.<br> I didn't sin, you sinned.<br> I did not.<br> I did not sin.<br> Go to your closet.<br> No, Mama.<br> Go to your closet and pray.<br> You pray.<br> No.<br> No!<br> No!<br> Get off me! Mama! Stop it!<br> Go to your closet and<br> pray for forgiveness.<br> No!<br> - You pray.<br> - Mama! Help!<br> - No, Mommy!<br> - Come on.<br> Please! Help!<br> You pray, little girl.<br> Pray for forgiveness.<br> Mommy, let me go!<br> Let me out!<br> Mom!<br> God, you suck!<br> Help me. Help me.<br> What?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - What?<br> Hey. What's wrong?<br> I really messed up today, Tommy.<br> What, that thing with Carrie?<br> You know about that?<br> Yeah, everyone knows about it,<br> but you're not responsible<br> for what Chris does.<br> Yeah, but it was me, too.<br> You threw tampons at Carrie White?<br> I kicked a kid in the ribs once.<br> Yeah, while he was knocked out.<br> Because this kid,<br> he used to beat the living shit out of me<br> every day in sixth grade.<br> Danny Patrick.<br> Did you apologize to Carrie?<br> Did you apologize<br> to Danny Patrick?<br> No, but we're not in sixth grade anymore.<br> Don't.<br> He was a dick to me.<br> What did Carrie White ever do to you?<br> Whoo!<br> And that, ladies and gentlemen,<br> is why he lost his license.<br> Then why<br> are you still driving?<br> I don't need a license<br> if they can't catch me.<br> Jackie's email, Jackie's email!<br> Chris, no. No!<br> Wow. Why don't you two<br> kiss or something while you're at it?<br> Oh, baby.<br> Don't be stupid.<br> Wait.<br> Do you think we're going to get detention<br> because of that?<br> - Because that would suck.<br> - No.<br> They should be thanking us<br> for helping her through her first period.<br> I got her a tampon. So what?<br> You were only trying to help her, right?<br> We should post it.<br> No, I'm in it.<br> No one's going to see you, Teenie.<br> What? What are you doing?<br> Carrie White.<br> Favorite movie?<br> Bloodsport.<br> Favorite drink?<br> Bloody Mary.<br> Brightly beams<br> Our Father's mercy<br> From His lighthouse evermore<br> But to us He gives the keeping<br> of the lights along the shore<br> Let the lower lights be burning<br> Did you finish your prayers, little girl?<br> Yes, Mama.<br> That's my good girl.<br> I love you.<br> I love you, too, Mama.<br> All right, stand up.<br> Line up, please.<br> You have a big week<br> coming up. A big month, actually.<br> Probably the biggest month of your lives.<br> Prom and then graduation.<br> Are you excited?<br> You probably all have your dresses.<br> You have your dates by now.<br> What about you, Chris?<br> Who's the lucky guy?<br> Billy Nolan. You don't know him.<br> He doesn't go to this school.<br> Are you going to get him a boutonniere?<br> Or are you just going to pin<br> a bloody tampon to his lapel?<br> I so don't need to hear this.<br> You're not going anywhere.<br> What about you, Sue?<br> Are you and Tommy busy campaigning<br> to be Prom King and Queen?<br> I would have voted for you.<br> Not now.<br> You all did a shitty thing yesterday.<br> A really shitty thing.<br> And one of you<br> had the audacity to post a video.<br> Somebody made a video of it?<br> This is bullshit.<br> That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen,<br> you're all running suicides.<br> I'm not doing it.<br> That's up to you.<br> That's up to all of you, but anyone<br> who stops running is suspended.<br> And if you're suspended,<br> you're not going to prom.<br> While you're running,<br> I'd like for you to think long and hard<br> about what it would be like<br> to be Carrie White.<br> I'll be okay, Mama.<br> I'm going to leave work early today<br> and pick you up after school.<br> She can't do this to me.<br> Just let it go, Chris. We're almost done.<br> Then every day this week?<br> All because of Carrie White?<br> Like hell I will.<br> Keep moving, Hargensen.<br> Keep running or you're<br> not going to prom.<br> Fuck you!<br> This is child abuse.<br> What did you say to me?<br> I'm not going to run another goddamn inch<br> because Carrie White got her period<br> and was too stupid to know what it was.<br> - What?<br> - You're suspended.<br> You're out of prom<br> and you're out of my class. Now.<br> - No.<br> - No?<br> You can't decide that.<br> She can't do this to us.<br> Goodbye, Chris.<br> The rest of you, keep at it.<br> Someone could die of dehydration.<br> Tina, you have a heart condition, right?<br> If we all stick together,<br> they're not going to suspend all of us.<br> They're not going to keep us all from prom.<br> There would be no prom.<br> Nik, Lizzy?<br> Let's go, ladies!<br> Heather?<br> This is bullshit!<br> We didn't do anything wrong.<br> All right, let's go.<br> Right, Sue?<br> You're with me on this, right?<br> Come on.<br> Sue.<br> Come on.<br> Keep going, ladies.<br> This isn't over.<br> This isn't over by a long shot.<br> That's Carrie White.<br> Um, you know... Sorry.<br> I was just going to say,<br> you can make it full-screen. Watch.<br> All right, who's next?<br> Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem.<br> Did you bring one?<br> Yeah.<br> Why don't you come to<br> the front of the class<br> and share it with us all?<br> "This unfrequented place<br> to find some ease<br> "Ease to the body some, none to the mind<br> "Times past,<br> and what once I was and what am now<br> "O wherefore was my birth<br> from Heaven foretold<br> "Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight<br> "Of both my Parents all in flames...<br> "...ascended."<br> Okay, uh, that was, uh...<br> ...disturbing.<br> That is the most<br> you've said in class all year.<br> Is there anything else<br> you'd like to share<br> or are you done scaring<br> us for the day?<br> Asshole.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Ross.<br> Did you say something?<br> I said, "Awesome."<br> I just thought<br> what Carrie read was awesome.<br> Didn't you, Mr. Ulmann?<br> All right, who's next? Uh...<br> Nicki.<br> I mean, Lizzy.<br> Is anyone working?<br> Excuse me.<br> Is anybody working?<br> Oh, Margaret.<br> I'm sorry to disturb you.<br> I don't know where Hugo and Gloria...<br> Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?<br> Yes, I'm picking up.<br> Margaret, I want to say how sorry I am<br> about what happened at the school.<br> There's no excuse for what Sue did,<br> but she's a good girl.<br> Are any of those girls good?<br> Oh, that is beautiful work, Margaret.<br> Thank you.<br> I love what you've done<br> with the neckline.<br> And the stitches.<br> You can barely see them.<br> So few people can sew like this anymore.<br> I could never do anything<br> like this myself.<br> Sue's going to look beautiful.<br> I am so excited for her.<br> I remember my prom.<br> Anyway, she's going to love it.<br> These are Godless times, Mrs. Snell.<br> This gym teacher<br> was running Chrissie<br> into the ground and used profanity.<br> I believe the term "shitty" was used.<br> She can't do that.<br> It's abuse of power.<br> You're right, Daddy.<br> That's what she said.<br> "Shitty." She's really abusive.<br> Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded<br> for what happened in class today.<br> But you know we've had a lot of problems<br> with your daughter in the past.<br> And now, with what she did<br> to her classmate, Carrie White.<br> The girl was having her...<br> What your daughter and her posse...<br> I'm not going to sit here<br> and listen to half-truths.<br> I know my daughter.<br> She said she didn't do it.<br> I want her prom privileges restored.<br> You can't prove she did anything,<br> can you?<br> I believe that there is a<br> video of the incident.<br> And I think<br> your daughter is the one who took it.<br> I think a video like that would probably<br> be pretty damning to anyone in it<br> and to the person who made it.<br> Don't you, Mr. Hargensen?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm just a gym teacher,<br> but it seems like a video like that<br> would probably affect college admissions,<br> possibly a lawsuit,<br> tons of bad publicity.<br> I wonder what The Today Show<br> would do with a video like that.<br> I think we should just look at her phone<br> and if it's not there,<br> I owe you a huge apology<br> and she should be allowed to go to prom.<br> Chris.<br> Chris.<br> Daddy,<br> I'm not going to give them my phone.<br> I have personal things on here.<br> Isn't that invasion of<br> privacy or something?<br> Chrissie, if you want to go to prom,<br> just give them the damn phone<br> and we can be done with this.<br> I have to get back to work.<br> Dad.<br> God damn it,<br> just give them your phone, Chris.<br> No.<br> So, I'm officially out of the prom.<br> I bet that cocksucker Morton<br> loses his job, though.<br> My dad is suing him.<br> Jesus, Sue, why didn't<br> you stand up for me?<br> We could have had them by the balls.<br> We deserved it<br> for what we did to Carrie White.<br> I thought I deserved it.<br> Desjardin was right.<br> We did a shitty thing for no reason.<br> Bullshit!<br> That Carrie goes around saying<br> that everyone but her and her mother<br> are going to hell<br> and you stuck up for her? Come on!<br> You can be such a pig sometimes, Chris.<br> What did Carrie White ever do to you?<br> She's been begging for it<br> since the sixth grade, Sue.<br> I got to go.<br> I seem to remember you were in there<br> throwing shit with the rest of us.<br> What was it that she was calling her?<br> - "Freak"?<br> - I stopped.<br> Oh, you stopped?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Why did you keep running?<br> Hmm?<br> - Why did you keep running, Sue?<br> - Stop it, Chris!<br> You kept running,<br> Sue, little Suze,<br> because you've been dreaming<br> about senior year<br> and the perfect boyfriend<br> and the perfect prom<br> your whole goddamned life.<br> You already booked the hotel,<br> already practiced the sounds<br> you're going to make<br> when you and Tommy<br> make love.<br> That's why you had this<br> bullshit change of heart.<br> You don't give a shit about Carrie White.<br> And everybody knows it.<br> Okay.<br> I'll see you around, Sue.<br> Carrie?<br> Carrie?<br> I'm not going to let<br> anyone hurt you, little girl.<br> You're safe here with me.<br> Got it.<br> Hey.<br> - How are you doing?<br> - Good.<br> - Good?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What's up?<br> - I want you to take Carrie White to prom.<br> Good one, babe.<br> Come on.<br> Are you serious?<br> I'm just trying to fix what I did.<br> Yeah.<br> I get that, but this is...<br> Sue, it's nuts.<br> Okay, so it's nuts.<br> But after what we did to her,<br> I have to do something.<br> I have to do something<br> that counts.<br> Uh...<br> What even makes you think<br> that she would say yes to me?<br> She'd say yes.<br> We've barely even spoken.<br> I saw how she looked at you in class<br> when you rescued her.<br> What girl doesn't<br> want to go to prom?<br> What girl doesn't want one magical night?<br> Maybe I can give<br> that up for her.<br> No. Babe, I want you<br> to have that magic night.<br> I don't want to go to prom<br> with Carrie White.<br> I want to go to<br> prom with you.<br> I can't go.<br> Hey, Carrie.<br> I was looking for you at the library<br> because that's where they said you were.<br> But, uh, you weren't there,<br> so I figured maybe you were here.<br> "Telekinesis: Unlocking the Mind."<br> No, no.<br> Is that about, uh, hypnosis?<br> Because me and my friends, we tried that.<br> We actually hypnotized my boy's dog.<br> Anyway, um...<br> How are you doing?<br> I'm okay.<br> Cool.<br> So you know how, um,<br> prom is next week?<br> You know?<br> Um, I was wondering,<br> if you don't have a date already,<br> maybe you want to go with me.<br> What?<br> The prom. Next week.<br> Carrie.<br> Hey.<br> - Carrie.<br> - Stop!<br> Please, just stop trying to trick me.<br> No, I'm not trying to trick you.<br> I'm not tricking you.<br> Aren't you with Sue Snell?<br> Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell,<br> but she doesn't want to go.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Did one of the girls try<br> something again?<br> No.<br> I got invited to prom.<br> Really?<br> That's great news.<br> With who?<br> It's Tommy Ross.<br> Wow. Tommy Ross?<br> He is pretty dreamy, huh?<br> Yeah.<br> I know who he goes<br> around with.<br> They're just going to<br> trick me again.<br> Right?<br> Maybe he really meant it.<br> No.<br> Yes, of course he did.<br> Why?<br> Why would he want<br> to go with me?<br> Come here.<br> Do you know what I see?<br> I see a beautiful young woman.<br> Maybe wear a little make-up.<br> Pinch your cheeks a little bit,<br> put some color in there.<br> Curl your hair.<br> Stand up straight.<br> There you go.<br> Come on, Sue.<br> You and Chris are best friends.<br> If you two...<br> If you three are planning on playing a<br> joke on a lonely, defenseless girl...<br> This has nothing to do with Chris.<br> Or you, Miss Desjardin.<br> And for me...<br> Listen, with due respect, Miss<br> Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.<br> It's kind of like a private thing.<br> And what is the big deal anyway?<br> It's just for one night, right?<br> Famous athletes like<br> Tim Tebow,<br> he takes kids to prom all the time<br> and everyone loves him for it.<br> Really?<br> You're hardly a famous athlete.<br> This is a really big deal for her.<br> Listen. it doesn't matter.<br> She said no.<br> - So you'll try again.<br> - Don't.<br> - Okay.<br> - It's not okay.<br> Tommy.<br> When you show up to prom<br> with Carrie White on your arm,<br> don't you think you're going to look<br> the tiniest bit ridiculous?<br> We don't care how we look. Do we?<br> No.<br> Come on.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Aren't you going to ask me in?<br> What do you want?<br> You can't be here.<br> Right to the point, huh?<br> Cool. About the prom.<br> You kind of left me hanging.<br> I already told you.<br> I know, but I was hoping<br> that you'd change your mind.<br> Girls change their mind all the time.<br> Why are you doing this?<br> Because I want to.<br> You need to leave.<br> I'm not leaving until you say yes.<br> Why is this so important to you?<br> Because I think<br> that we would have a good time.<br> And because I think<br> that what you read in class was cool.<br> I looked up that book<br> in the library myself.<br> That's the guy who brought<br> the temple down. Samson, right?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, okay, I'll go.<br> I have to be back by 10:30.<br> Sure, okay. Um...<br> I'll pick you up here at 7:00?<br> Okay.<br> Crazy, right?<br> Tommy Ross and Carrie White.<br> Where have you been?<br> I was worried sick. Come on. Come inside.<br> - I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.<br> - Just get inside.<br> Your supper's cold.<br> I'm going to have to heat it up.<br> I didn't know...<br> You're immodest.<br> I didn't know where you were.<br> I didn't know.<br> No, Mama. I took a bus to Main Street<br> and I bought cloth for a dress.<br> You are not to go anywhere<br> but to school and back. You know that.<br> Mama, before you say anything else,<br> I've been asked to prom.<br> Mama, I've been asked to prom.<br> Oh, God, why?<br> It's next Saturday and<br> he's a very nice boy.<br> And he'll come and meet you before<br> and he promised to have me home by 10:30.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - I already accepted.<br> I know this scares you.<br> It scares me, too.<br> The other kids,<br> they think I'm weird.<br> But I don't want to be.<br> I have to try to be a whole person.<br> Before it's too late.<br> He'll hurt you.<br> No, Mama.<br> No, Mama, there are bad people,<br> but not Tommy.<br> He's good.<br> You'll like him. He's a very nice boy.<br> Boys, boys.<br> After the blood,<br> comes the boys sniffing,<br> slobbering like dogs.<br> Stop it, Mama.<br> He's going to paw at you until he finds<br> where that blood smell comes from.<br> He's going to take you, Carrie,<br> in his car out to the wilderness,<br> out where it's cold<br> and the roadhouses are and the whiskey.<br> Stop being so crazy.<br> You tell that boy you're not going.<br> No.<br> We'll move from here.<br> We're never going to stop moving.<br> You're going to go to your closet<br> and you're going to pray.<br> You're going to get in there<br> and you're going to pray for forgiveness.<br> No, never again, Mama!<br> Mama, stand up.<br> Mama, stand up!<br> Mama, I'm going.<br> - Witch.<br> - I'm not a witch, Mama.<br> There are no witches.<br> The devil's got her now.<br> Like he did before.<br> It's not the devil, Mama.<br> There are other people out there like me<br> who can do what I can do.<br> You poor child.<br> Don't you know he's working through you?<br> Mama, it's inherited.<br> It was passed down from Grandma<br> and it skipped you.<br> You know that. Maybe it came from Daddy.<br> He gave me a cancer.<br> I thought you were cancer.<br> - That's awful. Don't say that.<br> - She's lost to me.<br> Pray all you want, Mama, but I'm going.<br> And nothing's going to stop me.<br> And I don't want to<br> talk about it anymore.<br> What are we doing?<br> What does this have to do<br> with Carrie White?<br> Baby, you said<br> you wanted us to do something about her.<br> It's a Piggy!<br> Here, piggy, piggy.<br> Here, piggy, piggy.<br> It smells like shit in here.<br> Chris, pick one.<br> Pick one that looks like her.<br> Pig's blood for a pig.<br> That one.<br> Go on.<br> One quick swing, all right?<br> I got this.<br> Don't worry, little piggy,<br> Uncle Jack is going<br> to bash your head right in.<br> You're not going to feel one...<br> Shut up! Do it already. Jesus.<br> I can't.<br> God, you guys are such goddamn pussies.<br> Shut up!<br> I'm sorry, Billy.<br> Come on, you got this.<br> All right, it's just<br> one quick slice and...<br> Oh, my God.<br> Good job, baby.<br> Sue. Hey, are you okay?<br> There we go.<br> Billy. Hurry up.<br> Oh, my God.<br> When the time comes,<br> I'll let you pull the rope, okay?<br> Oh, I plan on it.<br> Did you guys see Sue today?<br> She looked awful.<br> I know Chris isn't coming.<br> She's suspended.<br> Do you think she'll crash?<br> You never know with Chris, right?<br> So, I think I'm going to<br> have the after-party.<br> No.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Down?<br> No.<br> Yeah.<br> Whoo!<br> Will you pin it on me, Mama?<br> Red.<br> I might have known it would be red.<br> It's pink.<br> I can see your dirty pillows.<br> Everyone will.<br> Breasts, Mama.<br> Breasts. You have them<br> and every woman has them.<br> Take off that dress, Carrie.<br> No.<br> Take it off and we'll burn it together<br> and pray for forgiveness.<br> Mama, it's modest.<br> Call that boy and tell him<br> you're not going.<br> You just tell him you're sick.<br> I don't want you to get hurt.<br> Or you could just be<br> happy for me.<br> Mama, stop hurting yourself.<br> You know it's not going<br> to make me stay.<br> He's not coming. It's a trick.<br> Same as always.<br> He's going to come.<br> They're going to laugh at you.<br> They're all going to laugh at you.<br> Mama, stop it.<br> I'm nervous enough as it is.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> You see, Mama?<br> You see, it's all going to be okay.<br> Oh, repent. It's not too late.<br> Mama, don't ruin this for me.<br> I'll be home early.<br> I'm going to have to<br> tell that boy the truth<br> that your father took me<br> and you were born of sin.<br> - You'll say nothing, Mama.<br> - And from that sin...<br> From that sin<br> was born another.<br> The worst sin.<br> "A man or a woman who is a witch<br> "among you is to be put to death.<br> "You are to stone them."<br> I'm warning you, Mama.<br> The devil's hand.<br> Please don't do this.<br> There will be a judgment, Carrie.<br> As Jezebel fell from<br> the tower, you too...<br> Mama, you're not going to say<br> another word until I'm gone.<br> Mommy, I'm sorry.<br> I love you.<br> I'll be home early.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Do I look okay?<br> You look beautiful.<br> Tommy, can we wait a minute?<br> Yeah, sure,<br> we can wait as long as you want.<br> Are you scared?<br> They're not that bad.<br> Besides, I need you in there.<br> Dancing by myself all night,<br> I'd look awful silly.<br> Here, let me fix this.<br> I think this is supposed to<br> go on your wrist.<br> There.<br> Are you ready?<br> God, you look handsome, Ross.<br> Dawson!<br> Don't worry. If they kill each<br> other, I'll dance with you.<br> Carrie, this is my best buddy,<br> George Dawson.<br> And this is his girlfriend, Erika.<br> She goes to Dover.<br> Hi.<br> Come on, I'll show you the table.<br> I love your dress.<br> Where did you get it?<br> I made it.<br> No kidding. Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> - That's amazing.<br> Do you want to dance?<br> Or, if you want,<br> we could wait for a slower song.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll be back.<br> Miss Desjardin.<br> You look beautiful.<br> I'll let you two ladies talk.<br> Uh, do you want some punch?<br> I heard Greg and Harry spiked it.<br> Really?<br> No, I'm just kidding.<br> You're doing okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah?<br> Listen.<br> Do you really have to<br> be home so early?<br> I promised.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> I understand.<br> But, um, a bunch of people,<br> we're going to the Cavalier after.<br> - That's okay.<br> - What is?<br> I know you want to hang out<br> with your friends, and that's...<br> No.<br> It's a slow song.<br> No.<br> Yeah. Come on.<br> No, Tommy.<br> I've never danced before.<br> - It's okay.<br> - No, I can't. I can't do it.<br> You can't go to prom<br> and not have at least one dance.<br> I can't.<br> Carrie White,<br> will you have this dance with me?<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> It's so easy. Take this hand in my hand.<br> Like this, see?<br> You're going to put this hand<br> on my shoulder.<br> And I put my hand on your hip.<br> Then we sway.<br> See, it's easy.<br> You've got nothing to worry about.<br> And you're good, you're a good learner.<br> And then, if you want to<br> get fancy with it,<br> we can do the Dancing With The Stars.<br> - Yeah.<br> - No.<br> Yeah.

Mommy.<br> Mama?<br> Mama?<br> Mama?<br> Mama!<br> No.<br> No.<br> No.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Mama?<br> Mama?<br> Oh, Mama.<br> Mama, you were right.<br> They laughed at me, Mommy.<br> They all laughed at me.<br> I knew they'd hurt my little girl.<br> I should have killed myself<br> when he put it in me.<br> We slept in the same bed,<br> lived together sinlessly.<br> Then one night,<br> I saw him look at me in that way.<br> And we got down on our knees<br> to pray for strength.<br> And that's when he took me.<br> No, Mama. I don't want to hear it.<br> - And I liked it.<br> - Mama, no.<br> I should have given you to God<br> when you were born, but...<br> I was weak.<br> And I loved you so much.<br> And I said, "God,<br> "let me keep my little girl.<br> "Let me keep her."<br> Let's pray.<br> Yes, Mama.<br> Yes, we'll pray.<br> I'll be the preacher.<br> You'll be my congregation.<br> "Our Father, Who art in heaven,<br> "hallowed be Thy name.<br> "Thy kingdom come,<br> "Thy will be done<br> "on earth<br> "as it is in heaven."<br> Mama!<br> Mama, please.<br> No, Mama. Mama, please.<br> This isn't your fault, Carrie. It's mine.<br> - Mommy, this isn't right.<br> - You know the devil never dies.<br> He keeps coming back.<br> You've got to keep killin' him.<br> - No, Mama.<br> - Over and over again.<br> Mama, please. Mama!<br> No!<br> No, Mama.<br> Mama, stop it!<br> - Carrie.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Carrie!<br> Okay.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay. No one's going to hurt you.<br> No one's going to hurt you.<br> Carrie?<br> Let me help you, Carrie.<br> Why couldn't you leave me alone?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Look what you turned me into.<br> Don't hurt me, Carrie.<br> Why not?<br> I've been hurt my whole life.<br> I killed my mom.<br> I want her back.<br> I'm scared.<br> We've got to get out of here!<br> Give me your hand.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Come on!<br> - It's a girl.<br> - What?<br> You don't know?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Get out!<br> Get out!<br> It's okay.<br> Miss Snell,<br> we 're trying to determine the exact role<br> Carrie White played in the tragedy<br> an prom night.<br> You would agree that you were under<br> an enormous amount of stress.<br> Isn't it possible<br> that what you saw was a natural act?<br> My boyfriend,<br> most of my friends, died that night,<br> but I know what I saw.<br> You want an explanation?<br> Carrie had some sort of power,<br> but she was just like me,<br> like any of you.<br> She had hopes and she had fears.<br> And we pushed her.<br> And you can only push<br> someone so far<br> before they break.<br> I can hardly make you mine<br> Tell it to you all the time<br> At the end of a long day<br> and when I wake<br> If you could just give me a sign<br> We could leave it all behind<br> Stop taking the long way before we play<br> I don't think I can make it<br> and I know you're the one<br> Staring into the tears like a loaded gun<br> Well, I can hardly make you mine<br> Tell it to you all the time<br> But you never wanted,<br> but you had to take<br> So I can never give you up<br> I guess it's 'cause it's<br> just a crush<br> Before the end of a long<br> day and then I wake<br> But I know you're not<br> the one or the only<br> But we both know what it's<br> like to be lonely<br> Well, these fantasies,<br> they left us lonely<br> Boy, just bring all your<br> love back to me<br> I guess for now this is how it'll be<br> I don't think I can make it<br> Oh, you're the one<br> Staring into the tears<br> like a loaded gun<br> I don't think I can make it<br> Oh, you're the one<br> Staring into the tears<br> like a loaded gun<br>
