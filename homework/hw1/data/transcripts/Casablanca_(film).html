                        NARRATOR: With the coming<br> of the Second World War...<br> ... many eyes in imprisoned Europe<br> turned hopefully, or desperately...<br> ... toward the freedom of the Americas.<br> Lisbon became<br> the great embarkation point.<br> But not everybody could get<br> to Lisbon directly.<br> And so a torturous, roundabout<br> refugee trail sprang up.<br> Paris to Marseilles...<br> ... across the Mediterranean to Oran.<br> Then, by train or auto or foot,<br> across the rim of Africa...<br> ... to Casablanca in French Morocco.<br> Here, the fortunate ones,<br> through money or influence or luck...<br> ... might obtain exit visas<br> and scurry to Lisbon.<br> And from Lisbon to the New World.<br> But the others wait in Casablanca.<br> And wait and wait...<br> ... and wait.<br> Chattering<br> To all officers:<br> Two German couriers carrying official<br> documents murdered on train from Oran.<br> Murderer and possible accomplices<br> headed for Casablanca.<br> Round up all suspicious characters<br> and search them for stolen document.<br> Important.<br> Speaks in French<br> Siren Wailing<br> May we see your papers?<br> I don't think I have them on me.<br> - In that case, you'll have to come along.<br> - Wait. It's possible that I...<br> Yes. Here they are.<br> These papers expired three weeks ago.<br> You'll have to come along.<br> Halt!<br> Halt!<br> Gunshot<br> - What on earth is going on there?<br> MAN: I don't know, my dear.<br> Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, Madame.<br> Have you not heard?<br> We hear very little,<br> and we understand even less.<br> Two German couriers<br> were found murdered in the desert.<br> The unoccupied desert.<br> This is the customary roundup<br> of refugees, liberals...<br> ...and, of course, a beautiful young girl<br> for Renault, the prefect of police.<br> Along with these unhappy refugees...<br> ...the scum of Europe<br> has gravitated to Casablanca.<br> Some of them have been waiting<br> years for a visa.<br> I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.<br> Be on guard.<br> This place is full of vultures.<br> Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!<br> - Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> - Not at all. Au revoir, monsieur.<br> - Au revoir, Madame.<br> - Au revoir.<br> What an amusing little fellow.<br> Waiter.<br> - Oh, how silly of me.<br> - What, dear?<br> I've left my wallet in the hotel.<br> Plane Engine Roaring<br> Perhaps tomorrow<br> we'll be on the plane.<br> Speaks in German<br> MAN: Heil Hitler.<br> CROWD: Heil Hitler.<br> It is good to see you again,<br> Major Strasser.<br> Thank you, thank you.<br> May I present Captain Renault, police<br> prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.<br> Unoccupied France welcomes you<br> to Casablanca.<br> Thank you, captain.<br> It's good to be here.<br> Major Strasser, my aide,<br> Lieutenant Casselle.<br> Captain Tonnelli.<br> The Italian service at your command.<br> That is kind of you.<br> Speaking in Italian<br> You may find the climate<br> of Casablanca a trifle warm.<br> We Germans must get used to all<br> climates, from Russia to the Sahara.<br> Perhaps you<br> weren't referring to weather.<br> What else?<br> The murder of the couriers.<br> What has been done?<br> My men are rounding up<br> twice the usual number of suspects.<br> But we know already<br> who the murderer is.<br> Good. Is he in custody?<br> No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.<br> Everybody comes to Rick's.<br> I've already heard about this caf.<br> And also about Mr. Rick himself.<br> Band Playing<br> For nobody else<br> gave me a thrill<br> Honey, with all your faults<br> I love you still<br> Had to be you<br> wonderful you. Had to be you!<br> Cause my hair is curly<br> Waiting, waiting, waiting.<br> I'll never get out of here.<br> I'll die in Casablanca.<br> But can't you make it just a little more?<br> Please?<br> Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on<br> the market. Everybody sells diamonds.<br> There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.<br> All right.<br> The trucks are waiting.<br> The men are waiting. Everything...<br> Men Speaking in German<br> It's the fishing smack Santiago.<br> It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here<br> from the end of La Medina. Third boat.<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> - And bring 15,000 francs in cash.<br> Remember, in cash.<br> Speaking in Cantonese<br> Indistinct<br> Cheerio.<br> CARL: Open up, Abdul.<br> - Yes, professor.<br> - Waiter?<br> - Yes, Madame?<br> Will you ask Rick<br> if he'll have a drink with us?<br> He never drinks with customers.<br> Never. I have never seen it.<br> WOMAN:<br> What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?<br> Perhaps if you told him...<br> ...I ran the second-largest<br> banking house in Amsterdam.<br> Second largest?<br> That wouldn't impress Rick.<br> The leading banker in Amsterdam<br> is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.<br> We have something<br> to look forward to.<br> And his father is the bellboy.<br> Monsieur.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> This is a private room.<br> Of all the nerve. Who do you think..?<br> I know there is gambling in there.<br> - You dare not keep me out.<br> RICK: Yes? What's the trouble?<br> I have been in every gambling room<br> between Honolulu and Berlin.<br> And if you think I'm going to be kept out<br> of a saloon like this...<br> ...you're much mistaken.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> Hello, Rick.<br> Your cash is good at the bar.<br> What? Do you know who I am?<br> I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.<br> This is outrageous!<br> I shall report it to The Angriff.<br> Watching you just now, one would<br> think you've been doing this all your life.<br> - What makes you think I haven't?<br> - Nothing.<br> - But when you first came, I thought...<br> - You thought what?<br> What right do I have to think?<br> May I?<br> Too bad about those two<br> German couriers, wasn't it?<br> They got a lucky break.<br> Yesterday they were just clerks...<br> ...today they are the honored dead.<br> You are a very cynical person, Rick,<br> if you'll forgive me for saying so.<br> I forgive you.<br> - Will you have a drink with me?<br> - No.<br> I forgot, you never drink with...<br> I'll have another, please.<br> You despise me, don't you?<br> If I gave you any thought,<br> I probably would.<br> But why?<br> Do you object<br> to the kind of business I do?<br> But think of all those poor refugees who<br> must rot here if I didn't help them.<br> That's not so bad. Through ways of<br> my own, I provide them with exit visas.<br> For a price, Ugarte. For a price.<br> But think of all the poor devils<br> who can't meet Renaults price.<br> I get it for them for half.<br> Is that so parasitic?<br> I don't mind a parasite.<br> I object to a cut-rate one.<br> Well, after tonight I will be through<br> with the whole business.<br> And I'm leaving, finally,<br> this Casablanca.<br> Who did you bribe for your visa?<br> Renault or yourself?<br> Myself.<br> I found myself much more reasonable.<br> Look, Rick.<br> Know what this is?<br> Something that even you<br> have never seen.<br> Letters of transit signed<br> by General de Gaulle.<br> Cannot be rescinded.<br> Not even questioned.<br> One moment.<br> Tonight I'll be selling those<br> for more money than I ever dreamed of.<br> And then, addio, Casablanca.<br> I have many a friend in Casablanca,<br> but somehow...<br> ...just because you despise me,<br> you are the only one I trust.<br> Will you keep these for me, please?<br> - For how long?<br> - Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.<br> - I don't want them here overnight.<br> - Don't be afraid of that.<br> Please keep them for me.<br> Thank you.<br> I knew I could trust you.<br> Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.<br> If anybody asks for me,<br> I'll be right here.<br> Rick...<br> ...I hope you're more impressed<br> with me now.<br> If you'll forgive me, I'll share my<br> good luck with your roulette wheel.<br> Just a moment.<br> I heard a rumor those two German<br> couriers were carrying letters of transit.<br> Huh?<br> Oh. I've heard that<br> rumor too. Poor devils.<br> You're right, Ugarte.<br> I am a little more impressed with you.<br> Muffled Clapping<br> - Say, who's got trouble?<br> - We got trouble...<br> - How much trouble?<br> - Too much trouble...<br> Well now, don't you frown<br> Just knuckle down and knock on wood...<br> - Who's unhappy?<br> - We're unhappy...<br> - How unhappy?<br> - Too unhappy...<br> That won't do<br> When you are blue, just knock on wood...<br> - How unlucky?<br> - Too unlucky...<br> But your luck'll change<br> If you'll arrange to knock on wood...<br> - Who's got nothing?<br> - We got nothing...<br> - Now who's lucky?<br> - We're all lucky...<br> - Just how lucky?<br> - Very lucky...<br> Well, smile up, then<br> And once again...<br> Let's knock on wood...<br> - Hello, Rick.<br> - Hello, Ferrari.<br> How's business at the Blue Parrot?<br> - Fine, but I'd like to buy your caf.<br> - It's not for sale.<br> - You haven't heard my offer.<br> - It's not for sale at any price.<br> - What do you want for Sam?<br> - I don't buy or sell human beings.<br> Too bad.<br> That's Casablanca's leading commodity.<br> In refugees alone<br> we could make a fortune...<br> ...if you'd work with me<br> in the black market.<br> Suppose you run your business<br> and let me run mine.<br> Suppose we ask Sam.<br> Maybe he'd like to make a change.<br> Suppose we do.<br> When will you realize<br> that in this world today...<br> ...isolationism is no longer<br> a practical policy?<br> Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him<br> at the Blue Parrot.<br> Oh, I like it fine here.<br> He'll double what I pay you.<br> I ain't got time to spend<br> what I make here.<br> Sorry.<br> The boss's private stock...<br> ...because, Yvonne, I love you.<br> - Oh, shut up.<br> All right, all right. For you, I shut up,<br> because, Yvonne, I love you.<br> Uh-oh.<br> Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick.<br> Some Germans gave this check.<br> Is it all right?<br> Where were you last night?<br> That's so long ago,<br> I don't remember.<br> - Will I see you tonight?<br> - I never make plans that far ahead.<br> Give me another.<br> - Sascha, she's had enough.<br> - Don't listen to him. Fill it up.<br> Yvonne, I love you,<br> but he pays me.<br> - Rick, I'm tired of having you...<br> - Sascha, call a cab.<br> - We're gonna get your coat.<br> - Take your hands off me.<br> You're going home.<br> You've had a little too much to drink.<br> Hey, taxi.<br> Who do you think you are,<br> pushing me around?<br> I was a fool<br> to fall for a man like you.<br> Go with her, Sascha.<br> Be sure she gets home.<br> - And come right back.<br> - Yes, boss.<br> - Hello, Rick.<br> - Hello, Louis.<br> How extravagant you are,<br> throwing away women.<br> Someday they may be scarce.<br> I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.<br> Maybe get her on the rebound.<br> When it comes to women,<br> you're a true democrat.<br> Speaking in French<br> If he gets a word in,<br> it'll be a major Italian victory.<br> Plane Engine Roaring<br> The plane to Lisbon.<br> You would like to be on it?<br> Why? What's in Lisbon?<br> The clipper to America.<br> I've often speculated on why<br> you don't return to America.<br> Did you abscond with the church funds?<br> Did you run off with a senator's wife?<br> I like to think you killed a man.<br> It's the romantic in me.<br> It's a combination of all three.<br> And what in heaven's name<br> brought you to Casablanca?<br> My health.<br> I came to Casablanca for the waters.<br> The waters? What waters?<br> We're in the desert.<br> - I was misinformed.<br> - Hm.<br> EMIL:<br> Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.<br> A gentleman inside<br> has won 20,000 francs...<br> ...and the cashier<br> would like some money.<br> I'll get it from the safe.<br> I'm so upset, Rick. You know I...<br> Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that<br> happen all the time.<br> EMIL:<br> I'm awfully sorry.<br> Rick, there will be some excitement<br> here tonight. An arrest in your caf.<br> - Again?<br> - This is no ordinary arrest.<br> A murderer, no less.<br> If you're thinking of warning him, don't<br> put yourself out. He cannot escape.<br> - I stick my neck out for nobody.<br> - A wise foreign policy.<br> Speaks in French<br> Could have made the arrest earlier,<br> at the Blue Parrot.<br> Out of my regard for you,<br> we're staging it here.<br> It will amuse your customers.<br> Our entertainment's enough.<br> We're to have an important guest<br> here tonight.<br> Major Strasser<br> of the Third Reich, no less.<br> We want him to be here<br> when we make the arrest.<br> A demonstration of the efficiency<br> of my administration.<br> RICK: I see.<br> And what's Strasser doing here?<br> He certainly didn't come here to witness<br> a demonstration of your efficiency.<br> - Perhaps not.<br> - Here.<br> - It shall not happen again.<br> - That's all right.<br> Louis, you got something on your mind.<br> Why don't you spill it.<br> How observant you are.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I wanted to give you a word of advice.<br> Yeah?<br> - Have a brandy?<br> - Thank you.<br> There are many exit visas<br> sold in this caf...<br> ...but we know<br> that you've never sold one.<br> That is the reason<br> we permit you to remain open.<br> I thought it was because<br> I let you win at roulette.<br> That is another reason.<br> There is a man arrived in Casablanca<br> on his way to America.<br> He will offer a fortune to anyone<br> who'll furnish an exit visa.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Victor Laszlo.<br> Victor Laszlo?<br> Rick, that is the first time<br> I've seen you so impressed.<br> He's succeeded in impressing<br> half the world.<br> It's my duty to see that<br> he doesn't impress the other half.<br> Laszlo must never reach America.<br> He stays in Casablanca.<br> It'll be interesting<br> to see how he manages.<br> - Manages what?<br> - His escape.<br> - But I just told you...<br> - Stop it.<br> He escaped from a concentration camp.<br> The Nazis have chased him<br> all over Europe.<br> - This is the end of the chase.<br> - Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.<br> Is that a serious offer?<br> I just paid out 20,<br> and I'd like to get it back.<br> Make it 10.<br> I'm only a poor corrupt official.<br> - Okay.<br> - Done.<br> No matter how clever he is, he still<br> needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.<br> - Why two?<br> - He is traveling with a lady.<br> - He'll take one.<br> - I think not. I've seen the lady.<br> And if he did not leave her<br> in Marseilles or Oran...<br> ...he certainly won't leave her<br> in Casablanca.<br> Maybe he's not quite<br> as romantic as you are.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> There is no exit visa for him.<br> What ever gave you the impression<br> that I might help Laszlo escape?<br> Because, my dear Ricky,<br> I suspect that under that cynical shell...<br> ...you are at heart a sentimentalist.<br> Laugh if you will, but I happen<br> to be familiar with your record.<br> Let me point out just two items:<br> In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.<br> In 1936, you fought in Spain<br> on the Loyalist side.<br> And got well paid for it<br> on both occasions.<br> The winning side would<br> have paid you much better.<br> - Maybe.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> It seems you're determined<br> to keep Laszlo here.<br> I have my orders.<br> I see. Gestapo spank.<br> My dear Ricky, you overestimate<br> the influence of the Gestapo.<br> I don't interfere with them,<br> and they don't interfere with me.<br> In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.<br> - I am...<br> - Major Strasser is here, sir.<br> - You were saying?<br> - Excuse me.<br> Carl, see that Major Strasser<br> gets a good table, close to the ladies.<br> I have already given him the best...<br> ...knowing he is German<br> and would take it anyway.<br> Take him quietly.<br> Two guards at every door.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Everything is ready, sir.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Good evening, gentlemen.<br> - Good evening, captain.<br> - Won't you join us?<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's a pleasure to have you here, major.<br> - Champagne and a tin of caviar.<br> May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,<br> a good French wine.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Very well, sir.<br> - A very interesting club.<br> - Especially so tonight, major.<br> In a few minutes you'll see the arrest<br> of the man who murdered your couriers.<br> I expected no less, captain.<br> Monsieur Ugarte.<br> Oh. Yes?<br> - Will you please come with us?<br> - Certainly.<br> May I first please cash my chips?<br> Dealer Speaking in French<br> Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.<br> Thank you.<br> Screaming<br> Rick! Rick, help me!<br> - Don't be a fool. You can't get away.<br> - But, Rick, hide me. Do something!<br> Excellent, captain.<br> When they come for me,<br> I hope you'll be more of a help.<br> I stick my neck out for nobody.<br> I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,<br> but it's all over now.<br> Just sit down and have a good time.<br> Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.<br> Okay, boss.<br> Band Playing<br> RENAULT:<br> Rick.<br> Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser<br> of the Third Reich.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Rick?<br> - How do you do?<br> You already know Herr Heinze<br> of the Third Reich.<br> Please join us, Mr. Rick.<br> We are very honored tonight.<br> Major Strasser is one of the reasons the<br> Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.<br> You repeat Third Reich as though<br> you expected there to be others.<br> Well, personally, major,<br> I will take what comes.<br> Do you mind<br> if I ask you a few questions?<br> - Unofficially, of course.<br> - Make it official if you like.<br> - What is your nationality?<br> - I'm a drunkard.<br> And that makes Rick a citizen<br> of the world.<br> I was born in New York City,<br> if that'll help you any.<br> I understand you came here from Paris<br> at the time of the occupation.<br> There seems to be no secret about that.<br> Are you one of those people...<br> ...who cannot imagine the Germans<br> in their beloved Paris?<br> It's not particularly my beloved Paris.<br> Can you imagine us in London?<br> When you get there, ask me.<br> Diplomatist.<br> How about New York?<br> Well, there are<br> sections of New York, major...<br> ...that I wouldn't advise<br> you to try to invade.<br> Uh-huh.<br> - Who do you think will win the war?<br> - I haven't the slightest idea.<br> Rick is completely neutral<br> about everything.<br> And that takes in the field<br> of women too.<br> You were not always<br> so carefully neutral.<br> We have a complete dossier on you.<br> "Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.<br> Cannot return to his country."<br> The reason is a little vague.<br> We also know what you did in Paris.<br> And also we know why you left Paris.<br> Don't worry,<br> we're not going to broadcast it.<br> Are my eyes really brown?<br> You will forgive my curiosity,<br> Mr. Blaine. The point is...<br> ...an enemy of the Reich<br> has come to Casablanca...<br> ...and we are checking up on anybody<br> who can be of any help to us.<br> My interest in whether Victor Laszlo<br> stays or goes is purely a sporting one.<br> In this case you have no sympathy<br> for the fox?<br> Not particularly. I understand<br> the point of view of the hound too.<br> Laszlo published the foulest lies<br> in the Prague newspapers...<br> ...until the day we marched in.<br> And even after that, he continued<br> to print scandal sheets in his cellar.<br> Of course, one must admit<br> he has great courage.<br> I admit he's clever. Three times<br> he slipped through our fingers.<br> In Paris he continued his activities.<br> We intend not to let it happen again.<br> Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business<br> is politics, mine is running a saloon.<br> Good evening, Mr. Blaine.<br> You see, major?<br> You have nothing to worry about Rick.<br> Perhaps.<br> Yes, monsieur?<br> - I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.<br> - Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.<br> Two Cointreaux, please.<br> I saw no one of Ugarte's description.<br> Victor, I feel somehow<br> we shouldn't stay here.<br> If we would walk out so soon<br> it would only call attention to us.<br> Perhaps Ugarte is in<br> some other part of the caf.<br> Excuse me, but you look like a couple<br> who are on their way to America.<br> Well?<br> You'll find a market there for this ring.<br> I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.<br> - Thank you, but I hardly think...<br> - Perhaps for the lady.<br> The ring is quite unique.<br> - Yes, I'm very interested.<br> - Good.<br> What is your name?<br> Berger, Norwegian.<br> At your service, sir.<br> Victor.<br> I'll meet you in a few minutes<br> at the bar.<br> We don't want the ring,<br> but thanks for showing it to us.<br> BERGER: Such a bargain.<br> But that is your decision?<br> I'm sorry, it is.<br> - Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?<br> - Yes?<br> I am Captain Renault,<br> prefect of police.<br> Yes, what is it you want?<br> Merely to welcome you to Casablanca<br> and wish you a pleasant stay.<br> It isn't often we have<br> so distinguished a visitor.<br> Thank you.<br> I hope you'll forgive me, captain.<br> The present French administration<br> hasn't always been so cordial.<br> May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.<br> I was told you were the most beautiful<br> woman ever to visit Casablanca.<br> That was a gross understatement.<br> You're very kind.<br> - Won't you join us?<br> - If you will permit me.<br> Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your<br> best champagne. And put it on my bill.<br> - Captain, please.<br> - It's a game we play.<br> They put it on the bill,<br> I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.<br> Captain,<br> the boy who's playing the piano...<br> Somewhere I've seen him.<br> RENAULT: Sam?<br> - Yes.<br> He came from Paris with Rick.<br> Rick? Who is he?<br> Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.<br> Rick is...<br> - Is what?<br> - Mademoiselle...<br> ...he's the kind of man that,<br> well, if I were a woman...<br> ...and I were not around,<br> I should be in love with Rick.<br> But what a fool I am talking to a<br> beautiful woman about another man.<br> Excuse me.<br> Major.<br> Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,<br> may I present Major Strasser.<br> How do you do?<br> This is a pleasure<br> I have looked forward to.<br> I'm sure you'll excuse me<br> if I'm not gracious.<br> You see, Major Strasser,<br> I am a Czechoslovakian.<br> You were a Czechoslovakian. Now<br> you are a subject of the German Reich.<br> I have never accepted that privilege.<br> And I'm now on French soil.<br> I'd like to discuss some matters arising<br> from your presence on French soil.<br> This is hardly the time or place.<br> Then we shall state<br> another time and place.<br> Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.<br> With mademoiselle.<br> Captain, I am under your authority.<br> Is it your order<br> that we come to your office?<br> Let us say it is my request.<br> That is a much more pleasant word.<br> - Very well.<br> - Mademoiselle.<br> Mademoiselle.<br> A very clever tactical retreat, major.<br> - This time they really mean to stop me.<br> - Victor, I'm afraid for you.<br> We've been in difficult places before,<br> haven't we?<br> Clapping<br> All donde las rosas crecen<br> El amor comenz<br> Y fueron besos, dulces caricias<br> I must find out what Berger knows.<br> - Be careful.<br> - I will. Don't worry.<br> Monsieur Berger, the ring.<br> Could I see it again?<br> - Yes.<br> - Monsieur?<br> Champagne cocktail, please.<br> I recognize you from the news<br> photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.<br> In a concentration camp,<br> one is apt to lose a little weight.<br> We read five times that you were killed<br> in five different places.<br> As you see,<br> it was true every single time.<br> Thank heaven I found you, Berger.<br> I'm looking for a man by the name of<br> Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.<br> Ugarte cannot even help himself.<br> He's under arrest for murder.<br> He was arrested here tonight.<br> I see.<br> But we who are still free will do<br> all we can. We are organized.<br> Underground, like everywhere else.<br> Tomorrow night there is a meeting<br> at the Caverne du Bois.<br> If you will come...<br> SASCHA:<br> Monsieur.<br> Will you ask the piano player<br> to come over here?<br> MAN:<br> Very well, mademoiselle.<br> - How's the jewelry business, Berger?<br> - Not so good. Check, please.<br> Too bad you weren't here earlier.<br> We had quite a bit of excitement,<br> didn't we, Berger?<br> Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> - My bill.<br> - No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.<br> ILSA: Hello, Sam.<br> - Hello, Miss Ilsa.<br> I never expected to see you again.<br> It's been a long time.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> A lot of water under the bridge.<br> - Some of the old songs, Sam.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> PIANO PLAYING<br> Where is Rick?<br> I don't know.<br> I ain't seen him all night.<br> - When will he be back?<br> - Not tonight no more. He ain't coming...<br> He went home.<br> - Does he always leave so early?<br> - Oh, he never...<br> Well, he's got a girl<br> up to the Blue Parrot.<br> Goes up there all the time.<br> You used to be a much better liar, Sam.<br> Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.<br> You're bad luck to him.<br> Play it once, Sam.<br> For old times' sake.<br> I don't know what you mean,<br> Miss Ilsa.<br> Play it, Sam.<br> Play As Time Goes By.<br> I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.<br> I'm a little rusty on it.<br> I'll hum it for you.<br> HUMS<br> As Time Goes By Plays<br> Sing it, Sam.<br> You must remember this<br> A kiss is just a kiss<br> A sigh is just a sigh<br> The fundamental things apply<br> As time goes by<br> And when two lovers woo<br> They still say I love you<br> On that you can rely<br> No matter what the future<br> Brings as time goes by<br> Sam, I thought I told you never to play...<br> Well, you were asking about Rick,<br> and here he is. May I present...<br> - Hello, Ilsa.<br> - Hello, Rick.<br> Oh, you've already met Rick,<br> mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also...<br> This is Mr. Laszlo.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> One hears a great deal about Rick<br> in Casablanca.<br> And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.<br> - Won't you join us for a drink?<br> - Rick never...<br> RICK: Thanks, I will.<br> - Well...<br> ...a precedent is being broken. Emile.<br> - Interesting caf. I congratulate you.<br> - I congratulate you.<br> - What for?<br> - Your work.<br> Thank you. I try.<br> We all try. You succeed.<br> She was asking about you earlier, Rick...<br> ...in a way that made me<br> extremely jealous.<br> I wasn't sure you were the same.<br> - Let's see, the last time we met...<br> - Was La Belle Aurore.<br> How nice. You remembered.<br> But, of course, that was the day<br> the Germans marched into Paris.<br> - Not an easy day to forget.<br> ILSA: No.<br> I remember every detail.<br> The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.<br> Yes. I put that dress away.<br> When the Germans march out<br> I'll wear it again.<br> Ricky, you're becoming quite human.<br> I suppose we have to thank you for that.<br> Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one<br> to say it, but it's late.<br> So it is.<br> We have a curfew in Casablanca.<br> It would never do for the chief of police<br> to be found drinking after hours.<br> LASZLO: I hope we didn't<br> overstay our welcome.<br> RICK:<br> Not at all.<br> - Your check, sir.<br> - It's my party.<br> Another precedent gone.<br> This has been a very interesting evening.<br> I'll call you a cab.<br> Gasoline rationing, time of night.<br> - We'll come again.<br> - Anytime.<br> - Say good night to Sam for me.<br> - I will.<br> There's still nobody in the world who<br> can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.<br> He hasn't played it in a long time.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Night.<br> A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.<br> What sort is he?<br> I really can't say,<br> though I saw him quite often in Paris.<br> - Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.<br> - We'll be there.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Boss?<br> - Boss?<br> - Yeah?<br> - Boss, ain't you going to bed?<br> - Not right now.<br> Ain't you planning on going to bed<br> in the near future?<br> No.<br> - You ever going to bed?<br> - No.<br> Well, I ain't sleepy, either.<br> Good, then have a drink.<br> - Not me, boss.<br> - Then don't have a drink.<br> Boss, let's get out of here.<br> No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.<br> Please, let's go.<br> Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.<br> She's coming back.<br> I know she's coming back.<br> We'll take the car and drive all night.<br> We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,<br> stay away until she's gone.<br> - Shut up and go home, will you?<br> - No, sir, I'm staying right here.<br> They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.<br> Well, that's the way it goes.<br> One in, one out.<br> Piano Playing<br> - Sam.<br> SAM: Yes, boss?<br> If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,<br> what time is it in New York?<br> What?<br> My watch stopped.<br> I bet they're asleep in New York.<br> I bet they're asleep all over America.<br> Of all the gin joints in all the towns<br> in all the world...<br> ...she walks into mine.<br> - What's that you're playing?<br> - A little something of my own.<br> - Stop it. You know what I want to hear.<br> - No, I don't.<br> You played it for her.<br> You can play it for me.<br> - I don't think I can remember...<br> - lf she can stand it, I can.<br> Play it.<br> Yes, boss.<br> "AS TIME GOES BY" PLAYS<br> Cork Pops<br> Who are you really?<br> And what were you before?<br> What did you do,<br> and what did you think?<br> We said no questions.<br> Here's looking at you, kid.<br> A franc for your thoughts.<br> In America they'd bring only a penny.<br> I guess that's about all they're worth.<br> I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.<br> Well, I was wondering...<br> Yes?<br> Why I'm so lucky. Why I should<br> find you waiting for me to come along.<br> - Why there is no other man in my life?<br> - Uh-huh.<br> That's easy.<br> There was.<br> He's dead.<br> I'm sorry for asking.<br> I forgot we said no questions.<br> Well, only one answer can<br> take care of all our questions.<br> YELLING IN FRENCH<br> Man Yells in French<br> Over Loudspeaker<br> Nothing can stop them now.

Where were you?<br> Looking for a job.<br> Rumbling<br> Was that cannon fire?<br> Or is it my heart pounding?<br> It's the new German 77th, and judging<br> by the sound, only about 35 miles away.<br> And getting closer every minute.<br> Here, here, drink up.<br> We'll never finish the other three.<br> Them Germans will be here pretty soon,<br> and they'll come looking for you.<br> And don't forget,<br> there's a price on your head.<br> I left a note in my apartment.<br> They'll know where to find me.<br> It's strange.<br> - I know so very little about you.<br> - I know very little about you.<br> Just the fact that<br> you had your teeth straightened.<br> Be serious, darling. You are in danger.<br> You must leave Paris.<br> No, we must leave.<br> Yes, of course. We.<br> The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.<br> I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.<br> No, no. Not at my hotel. I...<br> I have things to do in the city<br> before I leave.<br> I'll meet you at the station.<br> All right, at a quarter to 5.<br> Why don't we get married<br> in Marseilles?<br> Stammers<br> That's too far ahead to plan.<br> Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.<br> Let's see... What about the engineer?<br> Why can't he marry us on the train?<br> Oh, darling...<br> Why not? The captain on a ship can.<br> It doesn't seem fair that...<br> Hey...<br> Hey, what's wrong, kid?<br> I love you so much.<br> And I hate this war so much.<br> It's a crazy world.<br> Anything can happen.<br> If you shouldn't get away...<br> I mean if...<br> If something should keep us apart...<br> ...wherever they put you...<br> ...and wherever I'll be,<br> I want you to know that I...<br> Rumbling<br> Kiss me.<br> Kiss me as if it were the last time.<br> Yelling in French<br> All aboard! The last train<br> leaving in three minutes.<br> Where is she?<br> Have you seen her?<br> I can't find her.<br> She checked out of the hotel.<br> But this note came just after you left.<br> Whistle Blows<br> That's the last call, Mr. Richard.<br> Do you hear me?<br> Come on, Mr. Richard.<br> Let's get out of here. Come on.<br> Train Whistle Blows<br> Piano Stops<br> - Rick, I have to talk to you.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> I saved my first drink<br> to have with you. Here.<br> - No, Rick. Not tonight.<br> - Especially tonight.<br> Why did you have to come to<br> Casablanca? There are other places.<br> I wouldn't have come<br> if I'd known you were here.<br> Believe me, Rick, it's true.<br> I didn't know.<br> It's funny about your voice,<br> how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.<br> "Richard, dear,<br> I'll go with you anyplace.<br> - We'll get on a train and never stop."<br> - Don't, Rick.<br> I can understand how you feel.<br> You understand how I feel.<br> How long was it we had, honey?<br> - I didn't count the days.<br> - Well, I did.<br> Every one of them.<br> Mostly I remember the last one.<br> The wild finish. A guy standing<br> on a station platform in the rain...<br> ...with a comical look on his face...<br> ...because his insides<br> have been kicked out.<br> Can I tell you a story, Rick?<br> Does it got a wild finish?<br> I don't know the finish yet.<br> Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come<br> to you as you go along.<br> It's about a girl who had just come<br> to Paris from her home in Oslo.<br> At the house of some friends...<br> ...she met a man about whom<br> she'd heard her whole life.<br> A very great and courageous man.<br> He opened up for her a whole<br> beautiful world...<br> ...full of knowledge<br> and thoughts and ideals.<br> Everything she knew<br> or ever became was because of him.<br> And she looked up to him...<br> ...and worshiped him...<br> ...with a feeling she supposed was love.<br> Yes, that's very pretty.<br> I heard a story once. In fact,<br> I've heard a lot of stories in my time.<br> They went along with the sound<br> of a tinny piano...<br> ...playing in the parlor downstairs.<br> "Mister, I met a man once<br> when I was a kid," they'd always begin.<br> I guess neither one of our stories<br> is very funny.<br> Tell me...<br> ...who was it you left me for?<br> Was it Laszlo,<br> or were there others in between...<br> ...or aren't you the kind that tells?<br> Door Closes<br> I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the<br> letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.<br> I would suggest you search<br> the caf immediately.<br> If Rick has the letters, he's too smart<br> to let you find them there.<br> You give him credit<br> for too much cleverness.<br> My impression was he's just<br> another blundering American.<br> We mustn't underestimate<br> American blundering.<br> I was with them when they blundered<br> into Berlin in 1918.<br> As to Laszlo,<br> we want him watched 24 hours a day.<br> It may interest you to know that at<br> this very moment he's on his way here.<br> There is nothing we can do.<br> I'm delighted to see you.<br> Did you have a good night's rest?<br> I slept very well.<br> Strange. Nobody's supposed<br> to sleep well in Casablanca.<br> - May we proceed?<br> - With pleasure. Won't you sit down?<br> Thank you.<br> Laszlo, we will not mince words.<br> You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.<br> So far you have been fortunate<br> in eluding us.<br> You have reached Casablanca.<br> It is my duty to see<br> that you stay in Casablanca.<br> Whether or not you will succeed<br> is problematic.<br> Not at all. Renaults signature<br> is necessary on every visa.<br> Captain, is it possible that Laszlo<br> will receive a visa?<br> I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.<br> Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.<br> STRASSER:<br> And mademoiselle?<br> - You needn't be concerned about me.<br> - Is that all you wish to tell us?<br> Don't be in such a hurry.<br> You have all the time in the world.<br> You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.<br> Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.<br> - On one condition.<br> - And that is?<br> You know the leader of the underground<br> movement in Paris, in Prague...<br> ...Brussels, Amsterdam...<br> ...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...<br> - Even Berlin.<br> - Yes, even in Berlin.<br> If you will furnish me with their names<br> and whereabouts...<br> ...you'll have your visa in the morning.<br> And the honor of having served<br> the Third Reich.<br> I was in a German concentration camp<br> for a year.<br> - That's honor enough for a lifetime.<br> - You will give us the names?<br> If I didn't give them to you<br> in a concentration camp...<br> ...where you had more persuasive<br> methods at your disposal...<br> ...I certainly won't<br> give them to you now.<br> And what if you track down<br> these men and kill them?<br> What if you murdered all of us?<br> From every corner of Europe, hundreds,<br> thousands would rise to take our places.<br> Even Nazis can't kill that fast.<br> Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for<br> eloquence which I can now understand.<br> But in one aspect you are mistaken.<br> You said the enemies<br> of the Reich could all be replaced.<br> But there is one exception.<br> No one could take your place<br> if anything unfortunate...<br> ...should occur to you<br> while you were trying to escape.<br> You won't dare<br> to interfere with me here.<br> This is still unoccupied France.<br> Any violation of neutrality<br> would reflect on Captain Renault.<br> - Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.<br> - Thank you.<br> By the way, monsieur, last night<br> you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.<br> - Yes?<br> - I believe you have a message for him?<br> Nothing important.<br> But may I speak to him now?<br> You would find the conversation<br> a trifle one-sided.<br> Signor Ugarte is dead.<br> I'm making out the report now.<br> We haven't quite decided<br> whether he committed suicide...<br> ...or died trying to escape.<br> - Are you quite finished with us?<br> - For the time being.<br> Good day.<br> Undoubtedly, their next step will<br> be to the black market.<br> Excuse me, captain.<br> Another visa problem has come up.<br> - Show her in.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Sorry, monsieur, we were never<br> to handle the police.<br> - This is a job for Signor Ferrari.<br> - Ferrari?<br> It can be most helpful<br> to know Signor Ferrari.<br> He pretty near has a monopoly<br> on the black market here.<br> You will find him at the Blue Parrot.<br> MAN:<br> Thanks.<br> FERRARI:<br> Don't be too downhearted.<br> Perhaps you can<br> come to terms with Renault.<br> Thank you very much, signor.<br> RICK: Hello, Ferrari.<br> - Good morning, Rick.<br> The bus is in.<br> I'll take my shipment with me.<br> I'll have it sent over.<br> Have a drink with me.<br> I never drink in the morning.<br> And every time you send my<br> shipment over it's a little short.<br> Carrying charges, my boy.<br> Carrying charges.<br> Here, sit down.<br> There is something I want<br> to talk over with you, anyhow.<br> Bourbon.<br> The news about Ugarte<br> upsets me very much.<br> You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel<br> any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.<br> Of course not. What upsets me<br> is that Ugarte is dead...<br> ...and no one knows where<br> those letters are.<br> Practically no one.<br> If I had those letters,<br> I could make a fortune.<br> So could I,<br> and I'm a poor businessman.<br> I have a proposition<br> for whoever has those letters.<br> I'll handle the entire transaction.<br> Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,<br> for a small percentage.<br> And the carrying charges?<br> Naturally there will be a few<br> incidental expenses.<br> That's my proposition<br> for whoever has those letters.<br> I'll tell him when he comes in.<br> Rick, I think you know<br> where those letters are.<br> You're in good company. Renault<br> and Strasser probably think so too.<br> That's why I came here. To give<br> them a chance to ransack my place.<br> Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into<br> your confidence. You need a partner.<br> Excuse me, I'll be getting back.<br> LASZLO:<br> Morning.<br> Signor Ferrari<br> is the fat gent at the table.<br> MAN: You will not find a treasure<br> like this in all Morocco.<br> Only 700 francs.<br> - You're being cheated.<br> - Doesn't matter, thank you.<br> For friends of Rick's<br> we have a small discount.<br> Did I say 700 francs?<br> You can have it for 200.<br> I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive<br> you when you called on me last night.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> For special friends of Rick's<br> we have a special discount. 100 francs.<br> Your story had me a little confused.<br> Or maybe it was the bourbon.<br> I have some tablecloths, napkins...<br> - Thank you. I'm really not interested.<br> - Please, one minute.<br> Why did you come back? To tell me why<br> you ran out on me at the railway station?<br> Yes.<br> Well, you can tell me now.<br> I'm reasonably sober.<br> I don't think I will, Rick.<br> Why not? After all, I got stuck with<br> a railway ticket.<br> I think I'm entitled to know.<br> Last night I saw<br> what has happened to you.<br> The Rick I knew in Paris,<br> I could tell him, he'd understand.<br> But the one who looked at me<br> with such hatred...<br> I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.<br> We'll never see each other again.<br> We knew very little about each other<br> when we were in love in Paris.<br> If we leave it that way...<br> ...maybe we'll remember<br> those days and not Casablanca.<br> Not last night.<br> Did you run out on me because<br> you knew what it would be like?<br> Hiding from the police,<br> running away all the time?<br> You can believe that if you want to.<br> Well, I'm not running away anymore.<br> I'm settled now.<br> Above a saloon, it's true...<br> ...but walk up a flight...<br> ...I'll be expecting you.<br> All the same,<br> someday you'll lie to Laszlo.<br> You'll be there.<br> No, Rick.<br> No. You see, Victor Laszlo<br> is my husband.<br> And was,<br> even when I knew you in Paris.<br> I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that<br> unfortunately I'm not able to help him.<br> You see, my dear,<br> word has gone around.<br> As leader of all illegal activities in<br> Casablanca...<br> ...I am influential and respected.<br> But it would not be worth my life<br> to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.<br> You, however, are a different matter.<br> Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be<br> possible to get an exit visa for you.<br> - You mean for me to go on alone?<br> - And only alone.<br> I'll stay here and keep on trying.<br> I'm sure in a little while...<br> Might as well be frank, monsieur.<br> It would take a miracle to get you out.<br> The Germans have outlawed miracles.<br> We are only interested in two visas.<br> - Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.<br> - No, Victor.<br> You two will want to discuss this.<br> Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.<br> No, Ilsa.<br> I won't let you stay here.<br> You must get to America. Believe me,<br> somehow I will get out and join you.<br> But if the situation were different...<br> ...if I had to stay<br> and there were only visa for one...<br> ...would you take it?<br> Yes, I would.<br> Yes, I see.<br> When I had trouble getting out of Lille,<br> why didn't you leave me there?<br> When I was sick<br> in Marseilles for two weeks...<br> ...and you were in danger every minute,<br> why didn't you leave me then?<br> I meant to,<br> but something always held me up.<br> I love you very much, Ilsa.<br> Your secret will be safe with me.<br> Ferrari is waiting for our answer.<br> Not more than 50 francs.<br> We've decided, Signor Ferrari.<br> For the present we will go on looking<br> for two visas. Thank you very much.<br> Well, good luck, but be careful.<br> - You know you're being shadowed?<br> - Of course. It becomes an instinct.<br> I observe that you, in one respect,<br> are a very fortunate man.<br> I am moved to make one more<br> suggestion. Why, I do not know.<br> Because it cannot possibly profit me.<br> Have you heard about Ugarte<br> and the letters of transit?<br> Yes, something.<br> Those letters were not found on Ugarte<br> when they arrested him.<br> - You know where they are?<br> - Not for sure.<br> But I'd guess that Ugarte<br> left those letters with Monsieur Rick.<br> Rick?<br> A difficult customer, that Rick.<br> One never knows what he'll do or why.<br> But it is worth a chance.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Good day.<br> Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.<br> I shall miss that<br> when we leave Casablanca.<br> Gracious of you to share it with me.<br> Good day, mademoiselle.<br> - Monsieur.<br> - Good day.<br> Piano Playing<br> - Here's to you, sir.<br> - Good luck.<br> - I'd better be going.<br> - My check, please.<br> I have to warn you, sir. This is<br> a dangerous place. Full of vultures.<br> Vultures everywhere.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - It has been a pleasure to meet you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Monsieur Rick, you are getting<br> to be your best customer.<br> Well, drinking.<br> I'm very pleased with you.<br> You're beginning<br> to live like a Frenchman.<br> That was some going-over<br> your men gave my place.<br> We barely got cleaned up<br> in time to open.<br> I told Strasser he wouldn't<br> find the letters here.<br> But I told my men<br> to be especially destructive.<br> You know how<br> that impresses Germans.<br> Rick, have you got<br> those letters of transit?<br> Louis, are you Pro-Vichy<br> or Free French?<br> Serves me right for asking a direct<br> question. The subject is closed.<br> - It looks like you're a little late.<br> - Huh?<br> So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.<br> Who knows? In her own way, she<br> may constitute an entire second front.<br> I think it's time for me to flatter<br> Strasser a little. I'll see you later.<br> Sascha!<br> French 75s.<br> Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.<br> Starting here and ending here.<br> We will begin with two.<br> SPEAKING IN FRENCH<br> What did you say?<br> Would you kindly repeat it?<br> - What I said is none of your business.<br> - I'll make it my business.<br> I don't like disturbances in my place.<br> Either lay off politics or get out.<br> You see, captain?<br> The situation is not as under control<br> as you believe.<br> We try to cooperate<br> with your government.<br> But we cannot regulate<br> the feelings of our people.<br> Captain, are you certain<br> which side you're on?<br> I have no conviction,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> I blow with the wind...<br> ...and the prevailing wind<br> happens to be from Vichy.<br> And if it should change?<br> Surely the Reich doesn't admit<br> that possibility?<br> We are concerned<br> about more than Casablanca.<br> We know that every French province<br> in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.<br> Waiting for their chance.<br> Waiting perhaps for a leader.<br> A leader? Like Laszlo?<br> Mm-hm. I have been thinking.<br> It's too dangerous to let him go,<br> it may be too dangerous to let him stay.<br> I see what you mean.<br> SPEAKING IN GERMAN<br> Thank you, Carl.<br> Thank you, Carl.<br> Sit down. Have a brandy with us.<br> To celebrate our leaving<br> for America tomorrow.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I thought you would ask me,<br> so I brought the good brandy...<br> ...and a third glass.<br> At last the day's came!<br> Frau Leuchtag and I<br> are speaking nothing but English now.<br> So we should feel at home<br> when we get to America.<br> A very nice idea.<br> - To America.<br> - To America.<br> To America.<br> SPEAKS IN GERMAN<br> What watch?<br> - Ten watch.<br> - Such much?<br> You will get along beautifully in America.<br> How is lady luck treating you?<br> Oh, too bad.<br> You'll find him over there.<br> - Monsieur Rick?<br> - Yes?<br> - Could I speak to you, please?<br> - How'd you get in? You're underage.<br> - I came with Captain Renault.<br> - I should have known.<br> My husband is with me too.<br> He is? Captain Renaults getting<br> broad-minded. Sit down.<br> Have a drink?<br> - No, of course not. You mind if I do?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Monsieur Rick,<br> what kind of a man is Captain Renault?<br> Like any other man, only more so.<br> No, I mean...<br> ...is he trustworthy?<br> Is his word..?<br> Just a minute.<br> Who told you to ask me that?<br> He did. Captain Renault did.<br> I thought so. Where's your husband?<br> At the roulette table,<br> trying to win enough for our exit visas.<br> Oh, of course he's losing.<br> - How long have you been married?<br> - Eight weeks.<br> We come from Bulgaria.<br> Things are very bad there.<br> The devil has the people<br> by the throat.<br> So Jan and I, we...<br> We do not want our children<br> to grow up in such a country.<br> - So you decided to go to America.<br> - Yes.<br> But we haven't much money...<br> ...and traveling is so expensive<br> and difficult.<br> It was much more than we thought<br> to get here.<br> And then Captain Renault sees us,<br> and he is so kind, he wants to help us.<br> Yes, I'll bet.<br> He tells me he can give us an exit visa.<br> But we have no money.<br> - Does he know that?<br> - Yes.<br> - And he's still willing to give you a visa?<br> - Yes.<br> - And you want to know..?<br> - Will he keep his word?<br> He always has.<br> Oh...<br> Monsieur...<br> ...you are a man.<br> If someone loved you very much...<br> ...so that your happiness was the only<br> thing that she wanted in the world...<br> ...and she did a bad thing<br> to make certain of it...<br> ...could you forgive her?<br> - Nobody ever loved me that much.<br> And he never knew, and the girl kept<br> this bad thing locked in her heart...<br> ...that would be all right,<br> wouldn't it?<br> - You want my advice?<br> - Yes, please.<br> Go back to Bulgaria.<br> Oh, but if you knew what it means to us<br> to leave Europe, to get to America...<br> Oh, but if Jan should find out.<br> He is such a boy.<br> In many ways<br> I am so much older than he is.<br> Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca<br> has problems.<br> - Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.<br> - Thank you, monsieur.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Good evening.<br> You see? Here we are again.<br> I take that<br> as a great compliment to Sam.<br> I suppose he means to you<br> Paris of happier days.<br> He does. Could we<br> have a table close to him?<br> And as far away<br> from Major Strasser as possible.<br> The geography may be<br> a little difficult to arrange.<br> - Paul, table 30.<br> PAUL: Yes, sir.<br> Right this way, if you please.<br> I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."<br> I believe that's your favorite tune.<br> Thank you.<br> "AS TIME GOES BY" PLAYS<br> - Two cognacs, please.<br> - Cognac.<br> Marquons les jeux, mesdames et<br> messieurs...<br> ...les jeux sont faits.<br> La partie continue.<br> Do you wish to place another bet, sir?<br> No. No, I guess not.<br> Have you tried 22 tonight?<br> I said 22.<br> Speaking in French<br> Leave it there.<br> Cash it in and don't come back.<br> Are you sure this place is honest?<br> Honest? As honest as the day is long.<br> How are we doing tonight?<br> A couple of thousand less<br> than I thought there would be.<br> Monsieur Rick...<br> I... Oh...<br> He's just a lucky guy.<br> Monsieur Rick,<br> may I get you a cup of coffee?<br> - No, thanks, Carl.<br> - Monsieur Rick...<br> Captain Renault, may l..?<br> Not here.<br> Come to my office in the morning.<br> We'll do everything businesslike.<br> - We'll be there at 6.<br> - I'll be there at 10.<br> I'm very happy for both of you.<br> Still, it's very strange that you won.<br> Well, maybe not so strange.<br> - I'll see you in the morning.<br> - Thank you, Captain Renault.<br> No!<br> Speaking Indistinctly<br> Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.<br> Go away, you crazy Russian.<br> As I suspected.<br> You're a rank sentimentalist.<br> Yeah? Why?<br> Why do you interfere<br> with my little romances?<br> Put it down as a gesture to love.<br> Well, I'll forgive you this time.<br> But I'll be in tomorrow night<br> with a breathtaking blond.<br> And it'll make me very happy<br> if she loses.<br> Mm-hm.<br> Mr. Blaine,<br> I wonder if I could talk to you.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Well, isn't there some other place?<br> It's rather confidential,<br> what I have to say.<br> - In my office.<br> - Right.<br> You must know it's very important<br> I get out of Casablanca.<br> It's my privilege to be one of the leaders<br> of a great movement.<br> You know what I've been doing.<br> You know what it means to the work,<br> to the lives of thousands of people...<br> ...that I reach America<br> and continue my work.<br> I'm not interested in politics.<br> The problems of the world<br> are not in my department.<br> I'm a saloonkeeper.<br> My friends in the underground tell me<br> that you have quite a record.<br> You ran guns to Ethiopia.<br> You fought against<br> the fascists in Spain.<br> What of it?<br> Isn't it strange you're always<br> fighting on the side of the underdog?<br> Yes, I found that<br> a very expensive hobby.<br> But then I never was<br> much of a businessman.<br> Are you enough of a businessman to<br> appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?<br> - I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.<br> - 200,000.<br> My friend, you could make it<br> a million francs or three.<br> My answer would still be the same.<br> There must be some reason<br> why you won't let me.<br> There is.<br> I suggest that you ask your wife.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - I said, ask your wife.<br> - My wife?<br> - Yes.<br> Singing Die Wacht Am Rhein<br> Play "La Marseillaise."<br> Play it!<br> Singing La Marseillaise<br> Vive la France!<br> See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in<br> a caf can inspire this demonstration...<br> ...what more will his presence<br> in Casablanca bring on?<br> I advise that this place<br> be shut up at once.<br> - But everybody's having a good time.<br> - Yes, much too good a time.<br> The place is to be closed.<br> - But I have no excuse to close it.<br> - Find one.<br> Whistle Blows<br> Everybody is to leave immediately.<br> This caf is closed until further notice.<br> Clear the room at once.<br> How can you close me up?<br> I'm shocked, shocked to find that<br> gambling is going on in here.<br> - Your winnings, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Everybody out at once.<br> After this disturbance it is not safe<br> for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.<br> This morning you implied it wasn't safe<br> to leave Casablanca.<br> That is also true, except for one<br> destination: Occupied France.<br> - Occupied France?<br> - Under safe conduct from me.<br> Of what value is that?<br> You may recall what German guarantees<br> have been worth in the past.<br> - There are two other alternatives for him.<br> - What are they?<br> The French authorities<br> may find a reason...<br> ...to put him<br> in the concentration camp here.<br> The other alternative?<br> My dear,<br> perhaps you have already observed...<br> ...that in Casablanca<br> human life is cheap.<br> Good night, mademoiselle.<br> - What happened with Rick?<br> - We'll discuss it later.<br> Our faithful friend is still there.<br> Please don't go<br> to the underground meeting tonight.<br> I must.<br> Besides, it isn't often that a man gets<br> to display heroics before his wife.<br> Don't joke. After Major Strasser's<br> warning tonight, I'm frightened.<br> Tell you the truth,<br> I'm frightened too.<br> Shall I remain here<br> in a hotel room, hiding?<br> Or shall I carry on the best I can?<br> Whatever I'd say,<br> you would carry on.<br> Victor, why don't you tell me<br> about Rick? What did you find out?<br> - Apparently he has the letters.<br> - Yes?<br> But no intention of selling them.<br> You'd think if sentiment<br> wouldn't persuade him, money would.<br> Did he give any reason?<br> - He suggested I ask you.<br> - Ask me?<br> Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."<br> I don't know why he said that.<br> Well, our friend outside will think<br> we've retired by now.<br> I'll be going in a few minutes.<br> - Ilsa, I...<br> - Yes?<br> When I was in the concentration camp...<br> ...were you lonely in Paris?<br> Yes, Victor, I was.<br> I know how it is to be lonely.<br> Is there anything you wish to tell me?<br> No, Victor, there isn't.<br> I love you very much, my dear.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Victor, whatever I do,<br> will you believe that I..?<br> You don't even have to say it.<br> I'll believe.<br> Good night, dear.<br> Good night.<br> - Victor.<br> - Yes, dear?<br> Be careful.<br> Of course I'll be careful.<br> Well, you are in<br> pretty good shape, Herr Rick.<br> How long can I afford to stay closed?<br> Two weeks, maybe three.<br> Maybe I won't have to.<br> A bribe has worked before.<br> In the meantime,<br> everybody stays on salary.<br> Thank you, Herr Rick.<br> Sascha will be happy to hear it.<br> I owe him money.<br> - You finish locking up, will you, Carl?<br> - I will.<br> - Then I am going to the meeting...<br> - Don't tell me where you're going.<br> I won't.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, Mr. Rick.<br> - How did you get in?<br> - The stairs from the street.<br> I told you this morning you'd come<br> around, but this is ahead of schedule.<br> Well, won't you sit down?<br> - Richard, I had to see you.<br> - "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.<br> Your visit isn't connected<br> by any chance with the letters of transit?<br> Seems as long as I have those letters<br> I'll never be lonely.<br> Ask any price you want,<br> but you must give me the letters.<br> I went all through that<br> with your husband. It's no deal.<br> I know how you feel about me...<br> ...but put your feelings aside<br> for something more important.<br> I have to hear again<br> what a great man your husband is...<br> ...what an important cause<br> he's fighting for?<br> It was your cause too.<br> In your own way, you were fighting<br> for the same thing.<br> I'm not fighting for anything<br> anymore except myself.<br> I'm the only cause I'm interested in.<br> Richard.<br> We loved each other once. If those<br> days meant anything at all to you...<br> I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.<br> It's poor salesmanship.<br> Listen to me. If you knew what really<br> happened, if you only knew the truth...<br> I wouldn't believe you<br> no matter what you said.<br> You'd say anything now<br> to get what you want.<br> You want to feel sorry for yourself,<br> don't you?<br> With so much at stake<br> all you can think of is your feelings.<br> One woman has hurt you...<br> ...and you take your revenge<br> on the rest of the world.<br> You're a coward and a weakling.<br> No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.<br> If you don't help us,<br> Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.<br> What of it?<br> I'm going to die in Casablanca.<br> It's a good spot for it.<br> Now, if you'll...<br> All right.<br> I tried to reason with you.<br> I tried everything.<br> Now, I want those letters.<br> - Get them for me.<br> - I don't have to. I got them right here.<br> Put them on the table.<br> No.<br> For the last time,<br> put them on the table.<br> If Laszlo and the cause mean so much<br> to you, you won't stop at anything.<br> All right,<br> I'll make it easier for you.<br> Go ahead and shoot.<br> You'll be doing me a favor.<br> Richard...<br> ...I tried to stay away.<br> I thought I would never see you again.<br> That you were out of my life.<br> The day you left Paris...<br> ...if you knew what I went through.<br> If you knew how much I loved you.<br> How much I still love you.<br> And then?<br> It wasn't long after we were married<br> that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.<br> They needed him in Prague, but there<br> the Gestapo were waiting for him.<br> Just a two-line item in the paper:<br> "Victor Laszlo apprehended.<br> Sent to concentration camp."<br> I was frantic.<br> For months I tried to get word.<br> Then it came.<br> He was dead.<br> Shot trying to escape.<br> I was lonely.<br> I had nothing, not even hope.<br> Then I met you.<br> Why weren't you honest with me?<br> Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?<br> It wasn't my secret, Richard.<br> Victor wanted it that way.<br> Not even our closest friends<br> knew about our marriage.<br> That was his way of protecting me.<br> I knew so much about his work.<br> If the Gestapo found out I was his wife<br> it would be dangerous for me...<br> ...and for those working with us.<br> And when did you first find out<br> he was alive?<br> Just before you and I<br> were to leave Paris together.<br> A friend came and told me<br> that Victor was alive.<br> They were hiding him in a freight car<br> on the outskirts of Paris.<br> He was sick. He needed me.<br> I wanted to tell you,<br> but I didn't dare.<br> I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,<br> and the Gestapo would have caught you.<br> Well...<br> ...well, you know the rest.<br> Well, it's still a story without an ending.<br> What about now?<br> Now?<br> I don't know.<br> I know that I'll never have the strength<br> to leave you again.<br> And Laszlo?<br> You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?<br> You'll see that he gets out.<br> Then he'll have his work.<br> All that he's been living for.<br> All except one.<br> He won't have you.<br> I can't fight it anymore.<br> I ran away from you once.<br> I can't do it again.<br> Oh, I don't know<br> what's right any longer.<br> You have to think for both of us.<br> For all of us.<br> All right. I will.<br> Here's looking at you, kid.<br> I wish I didn't love you so much.<br> - I think we lost them.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm afraid they caught<br> some of the others.<br> Come inside.<br> Come, Mr. Laszlo,<br> I will help you immediately.<br> LASZLO:<br> Thank you.<br> RICK:<br> Carl, what happened?<br> The police break up our meeting,<br> Herr Rick.<br> We escaped at the last moment.<br> - Come up here a minute.<br> - Yes, I come.<br> Turn out the light in the rear entrance.<br> It might attract the police.<br> - But Sascha always puts out that light.<br> - Tonight he forgot.<br> Yes, I come. I will do it.<br> - I want you to take Miss Lund home.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It's nothing, just a little cut.<br> We had to get through a window.<br> This might come in handy.<br> Thank you.<br> - Had a close one, eh?<br> - Yes, rather.<br> Don't you sometimes wonder<br> if it's worth all this?<br> I mean, what you're fighting for.<br> We might as well question<br> why we breathe.<br> If we stop breathing, we'll die.<br> If we stop fighting our enemies,<br> the world will die.<br> What of it?<br> Then it'll be out of its misery.<br> You know how you sound,<br> Monsieur Blaine?<br> Like a man<br> who's trying to convince himself...<br> ...of something<br> he doesn't believe in his heart.<br> Each of us has a destiny.<br> For good, or for evil.<br> - I get the point.<br> - I wonder if you do.<br> I wonder if you know that you're trying<br> to escape from yourself...<br> ...and that you'll never succeed.<br> You seem to know all about my destiny.<br> I know a good deal more<br> about you than you suspect.<br> I know that you're in love<br> with a woman.<br> It's perhaps a strange circumstance...<br> ...that we both should be in love<br> with the same woman.<br> The first evening I came into this caf...<br> ...I knew there was something<br> between you and Ilsa.<br> Since no one is to blame...<br> ...I demand no explanation.<br> I ask only one thing.<br> You won't give me the letters of transit.<br> All right.<br> But I want my wife to be safe.<br> I ask you as a favor...<br> ...to use the letters<br> to take her away from Casablanca.<br> You love her that much?<br> Apparently you think of me only<br> as the leader of a cause.<br> Well, I am also a human being.<br> Yes, I love her that much.<br> Clattering<br> - Monsieur Laszlo?<br> - Yes?<br> You'll come with us.<br> We have a warrant for your arrest.<br> On what charge?<br> Captain Renault will discuss that<br> with you later.<br> It seems that destiny has taken a hand.<br> You haven't any proof, and you know it.<br> This isn't Germany or occupied France.<br> All you can do is fine him<br> and give him 30 days.<br> You might as well let him go now.<br> I'd advise you not to be too interested<br> in what happens to Laszlo.<br> If you were to help him escape...<br> What makes you think<br> I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?<br> Because, one,<br> you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.<br> Two, you've got the letters of transit.<br> Don't bother to deny it.<br> And you might do it simply<br> because you don't like Strasser's looks.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I don't either.<br> They're all excellent reasons.<br> Don't count too much on my friendship.<br> In this matter I'm powerless.<br> Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.<br> You're not very subtle,<br> but you are effective. I get the point.<br> Yes, I have the letters.<br> But I intend using them myself.<br> I'm leaving Casablanca<br> on tonight's plane. The last plane.<br> And I'm taking a friend with me.<br> One you'll appreciate.<br> - What friend?<br> - Ilsa Lund.<br> That ought to put your mind to rest<br> about my helping Laszlo escape.<br> The last man I want to see in America.<br> You didn't come here to tell me this.<br> You have the letters of transit.<br> You can fill in your name and hers<br> and leave anytime you please.<br> Why are you still interested<br> in what happens to Laszlo?<br> I'm not. But I am interested<br> in what happens to Ilsa and me.<br> We have a legal right to go,<br> that's true...<br> ...but people have been held<br> in Casablanca...<br> ...in spite of their legal rights.<br> What makes you think<br> we want to hold you?<br> Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.<br> She probably knows things<br> that Strasser would like to know.<br> Louis, I'll make a deal with you.<br> Instead of this petty charge against him,<br> you could get something big...<br> ...something that would chuck him<br> in a concentration camp for years...<br> - Be quite a feather in your cap, right?<br> - Certainly.<br> Germany...<br> Vichy would be very grateful.<br> Then release him.<br> You be at my place a half-hour<br> before the plane leaves.<br> I'll have Laszlo come there<br> to pick up the letters...<br> ...and that'll give you grounds<br> to make the arrest.<br> You get him, and we get away.<br> To the Germans,<br> that last will be just a minor annoyance.<br> There's still something about this<br> I don't quite understand.<br> Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...<br> ...but you were never interested<br> in any woman.<br> - She isn't just any woman.<br> - I see.<br> How do I know you'll keep<br> your end of the bargain?<br> I'll make the arrangements now<br> with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.<br> I'm gonna miss you.<br> You're the only one in Casablanca<br> who has less scruples than I.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> Go ahead, Ricky.<br> Call off your watchdogs<br> when you let him go.<br> I don't want them around this afternoon.<br> I'm taking no chances, Louis,<br> not even with you.<br> FERRARI: Should we draw up papers,<br> or is a handshake good enough?<br> Certainly not good enough.<br> But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.<br> To get out of Casablanca and<br> go to America... You're a lucky man.<br> My agreement with Sam is that he gets<br> I happen to know he gets 10 percent.<br> But he's worth 25.<br> Abdul, Carl and Sascha,<br> they stay with the place or I don't sell.<br> Of course.<br> Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.<br> Well, so long.<br> Don't forget you owe Rick's<br> I shall remember to pay it to myself.<br> Stepping<br> Knocking<br> RICK:<br> You're late.<br> I was informed when Laszlo<br> left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.<br> - I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.<br> - He won't be followed here.<br> This place will never be<br> the same without you.<br> I know what you mean. But I've spoken<br> to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.<br> - Is everything ready?<br> - I have the letters right here.<br> When we searched the place,<br> where were they?<br> Sam's piano.<br> Serves me right for not being musical.<br> Tires Squealing<br> Here they are.<br> You better wait in my office.<br> Here.<br> Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.<br> Haven't you told him?<br> Not yet.<br> But you were able to<br> arrange everything?<br> Everything is quite all right.<br> We'll tell him at the airport.<br> The less time to think, the easier.<br> Please trust me.<br> Yes, I will.<br> - I don't know how to thank you.<br> - Save it. We've still lots of things to do.<br> LASZLO: I brought the money.<br> - Keep it, you'll need it in America.<br> - But we made a deal.<br> - Never mind that.<br> - You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?<br> - No. It's all arranged.<br> Good. I've got the letters here,<br> made out in blank.<br> All you have to do is fill<br> in the signatures.<br> RENAULT:<br> Victor Laszlo.<br> Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.<br> The charge of accessory to the murder...<br> ...of the couriers<br> from whom the letters were stolen.<br> You're surprised about my friend Ricky?<br> The explanation is simple.<br> Love, it seems,<br> has triumphed over virtue. Thank...<br> Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going<br> to be arrested. Not for a while yet.<br> - Have you lost your mind?<br> - I have. Sit down.<br> - Put that gun down.<br> - I don't want to shoot you...<br> ...but I will if you take one more step.<br> Under the circumstances,<br> I will sit down.<br> - Keep your hands on the table.<br> - I wonder if you realize what this means.<br> I do. We've got time<br> to discuss that later.<br> Call off your watchdogs, you said.<br> Just the same, call the airport<br> and let me hear you tell them.<br> And remember,<br> this gun is pointed right at your heart.<br> That is my least vulnerable spot.<br> - Hello? Is that the airport?<br> - Huh?<br> This is Captain Renault speaking.<br> There'll be two letters of transit<br> for the Lisbon plane.<br> There's to be no trouble about them.<br> Good.<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Buzzing<br> My car, quickly!<br> Speaks in German<br> This is Major Strasser.<br> Have a squad of police meet me<br> at the airport at once.<br> At once, do you hear?<br> MAN:<br> Hello, radio tower?<br> Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,<br> east runway.<br> Visibility, 11/2 miles.<br> Light ground fog.<br> Depth of fog approximately 500.<br> Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.<br> Have your man go with Laszlo<br> and take care of his luggage.<br> Certainly, Rick, anything you say.<br> Find Laszlo's luggage.<br> Put it on the plane.<br> Yes, sir.<br> This way, please.<br> If you don't mind, fill in the names.<br> That'll make it more official.<br> You think of everything, don't you?<br> And the names are<br> Mr. And Mrs. Victor Laszlo.<br> - But why my name, Richard?<br> - Because you're getting on that plane.<br> I don't understand.<br> What about you?<br> I'm staying with him<br> till the plane gets away.<br> No. What has happened?<br> Last night you said...<br> Last night we said a great many things.<br> You said I was to do the thinking for us.<br> I've done a lot of it since then.<br> It adds up to one thing:<br> You're getting on that plane<br> with Victor where you belong.<br> - Richard, no...<br> - Now, you've got to listen to me.<br> Any idea what you'd have<br> to look forward to if you stayed here?<br> Chances are we'd both wind up<br> in a concentration camp. True, Louis?<br> I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.<br> - You're saying this only to make me go.<br> - I'm saying it because it's true.<br> Inside of us we both know<br> you belong with Victor.<br> You're part of his work,<br> the thing that keeps him going.<br> If that plane leaves<br> and you're not with him, you'll regret it.<br> Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,<br> but soon, and for the rest of your life.<br> But what about us?<br> We'll always have Paris.<br> We didn't have... We'd lost it<br> until you came to Casablanca.<br> We got it back last night.<br> - When I said I would never leave you.<br> - And you never will.<br> But I've got a job to do too.<br> Where I'm going, you can't follow.<br> What I've got to do<br> you can't be any part of.<br> Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.<br> But it doesn't take much to see<br> that the problems of three little people...<br> ...don't amount to a hill of beans<br> in this crazy world.<br> Someday you'll understand that.<br> Now, now.<br> Here's looking at you, kid.<br> Horn Honks<br> - Everything is in order.<br> - All except one thing.<br> There's something you should know.<br> I don't ask you to explain anything.<br> I'm going to anyway.<br> It may make a difference to you later on.<br> - You said you knew about Ilsa and me.<br> - Yes.<br> You didn't know she was at my place<br> last night when you were.<br> She came there for the letters of transit.<br> Isn't that true, Ilsa?<br> Yes.<br> She tried everything to get them.<br> Nothing worked.<br> She did her best to convince me<br> that she was still in love with me.<br> But that was all over long ago.<br> For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,<br> and I let her pretend.<br> I understand.<br> - Here it is.<br> - Thanks.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Welcome back to the fight.<br> This time I know our side will win.<br> Are you ready, Ilsa?<br> Yes, I'm ready.<br> Goodbye, Rick.<br> God bless you.<br> You better hurry.<br> You'll miss that plane.<br> I was right.<br> You are a sentimentalist.<br> Stay where you are.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> What you just did for Laszlo.<br> That fairy tale you invented<br> to send Ilsa away with him.<br> I know a little about women, my friend.<br> She went.<br> But she knew you were lying.<br> Anyway, thanks for helping me out.<br> I suppose you know this isn't<br> going to be pleasant for either of us.<br> Especially for you.<br> - I'll have to arrest you, of course.<br> - As soon as the plane goes, Louis.<br> What was the meaning<br> of that phone call?<br> Victor Laszlo is on that plane.<br> Why do you stand here?<br> Why don't you stop him?<br> Ask Monsieur Rick.<br> - Get away from that phone.<br> - I advise you not to interfere.<br> I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,<br> and I'm willing to shoot you.<br> - Hello!<br> - Put that phone down.<br> - Get me the radio tower.<br> - Put it down!<br> Major Strasser has been shot.<br> Round up the usual suspects.<br> Allez. Cette voiture.<br> Vous allez l.<br> Well, Rick,<br> you're not only a sentimentalist...<br> ...but you've become a patriot.<br> RICK: Maybe, but it seemed<br> like a good time to start.<br> I think perhaps you're right.<br> It might be a good idea for you to<br> disappear from Casablanca for a while.<br> There's a Free French garrison<br> over at Brazzaville.<br> - I could be induced to arrange a passage.<br> - My letter of transit?<br> I could use a trip.<br> But it doesn't change our bet.<br> You still owe me 10,000 francs.<br> That 10,000 francs<br> should pay our expenses.<br> RICK: "Our" expenses?<br> - Mm-hm.<br> RICK: Louis, I think this is the beginning<br> of a beautiful friendship.<br>
