                        When you love someone,<br> you've gotta trust them.<br> There's no other way.<br> You've got to give them the key<br> to everything that's yours.<br> Otherwise, what's the point?<br> And, for a while, I believed<br> that's the kind of love I had.<br> Before I ever ran a casino,<br> or got myself blown up...<br> Ace Rothstein was a hell<br> of a handicapper, I can tell you that.<br> I was so good that whenever I bet,<br> I could change the odds...<br> for every bookmaker<br> in the country.<br> I'm serious,<br> I had it down so cold...<br> that I was given<br> paradise on earth.<br> I was given one of the biggest casinos<br> in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...<br> by the only kind of guys that can<br> actually get you that kind of money...<br> $62,700,000.<br> I don't know all the details.<br> Nobody knew all the details,<br> but it should've been perfect.<br> I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro,<br> his best friend, watching his ass...<br> and he had, Ginger,<br> the woman he loved, on his arm.<br> But in the end,<br> we fucked it all up.<br> It should've been so sweet too.<br> But it turned out to be the last time<br> that street guys like us...<br> were ever given anything<br> that fuckin' valuable again.<br> At that time, Vegas was a place<br> where millions of suckers...<br> flew in every year<br> on their own nickel...<br> and left behind<br> about a billion dollars.<br> But at night, you couldn't see<br> the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.<br> But it's in the desert where lots<br> of the town's problems are solved.<br> Got a lot of holes<br> in the desert...<br> and a lot of problems<br> are buried in those holes.<br> Except you gotta do it right.<br> I mean, you gotta have<br> the hole already dug...<br> before you show up<br> with a package in the trunk.<br> Otherwise, you're talking about<br> a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin'.<br> And who knows who's gonna<br> be comin' along in that time?<br> Before you know it,<br> you gotta dig a few more holes.<br> You could be there<br> all fuckin' night.<br> Who could resist?<br> Anywhere else in the country<br> I was a bookie, a gambler...<br> always lookin' over my shoulder,<br> hassled by cops, day and night.<br> But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.<br> I'm not only legitimate,<br> but running a casino.<br> And that's like selling people<br> dreams for cash.<br> I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert,<br> as my manager, and I went to work.<br> ...the casino manager. And this is<br> Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.<br> For guys like me,<br> Las Vegas washes away your sins.<br> It's like a morality car wash.<br> It does for us what Lourdes<br> does for humpbacks and cripples.<br> And along with making us legit...<br> comes cash, tons of it.<br> I mean, what do you think we're doing<br> out here in the middle of the desert?<br> It's all this money.<br> This is the end result<br> of all the bright lights...<br> and the comp trips,<br> of all the champagne...<br> and free hotel suites,<br> and all the broads and all the booze.<br> It's all been arranged<br> just for us to get your money.<br> That's the truth about Las Vegas.<br> We're the only winners.<br> The players don't stand a chance.<br> And their cash flows<br> from the tables...<br> to our boxes<br> through the cage...<br> and into the most sacred room<br> in the casino.<br> The place where they add up<br> all the money...<br> the holy of holies,<br> the count room.<br> - Now, this place was off-limits.<br> - Verify 3,000.<br> Even I couldn't get inside.<br> But it was my job to keep it filled<br> with cash. That's for sure.<br> They had so much<br> fuckin' money in there...<br> you could build a house out<br> of stacks of hundred-dollar bills.<br> And the best part<br> was that upstairs...<br> - the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.<br> - Five thousand.<br> I mean, to them everything<br> looked on the up-and-up.<br> Right? Wrong.<br> Verify 5,000.<br> - The guys inside the counting room...<br> - Five thousand.<br> Were all slipped in there<br> to skim the joint dry.<br> They'd do short counts,<br> they'd lose fill slips.<br> They'd even take cash<br> right out of the drop boxes.<br> And it was up to this guy<br> right here...<br> standin' in front<br> of about two million dollars...<br> to skim the cash off the top<br> without anybody gettin' wise...<br> - the IRS or anybody.<br> - Verify 200.<br> Now, notice how in the count room<br> nobody ever seems to see anything.<br> Somehow, somebody's always<br> lookin' the other way.<br> Now, look at these guys.<br> They look busy, right?<br> They're countin' money.<br> Who wants to bother them?<br> I mean, God forbid they should make<br> a mistake and forget to steal.<br> Meanwhile,<br> you're in and you're out.<br> Past the jag-off guard<br> who gets an extra C-note a week...<br> just to watch the door.<br> It's routine. Business as usual:<br> In, out, hello, good-bye.<br> And that's all there is to it.<br> Just another fat fuck walkin' out<br> of the casino with a suitcase.<br> Now that suitcase was goin'<br> straight to one place:<br> Right to Kansas City,<br> which was as close...<br> to Las Vegas as the Midwest<br> bosses could go...<br> without gettin' themselves arrested.<br> That suitcase was all...<br> the bosses ever wanted.<br> - And they wanted it every month.<br> - Hey, John, how was your ride?<br> Now this old Mormon fuck here...<br> he had to fly in with suitcases<br> once a month, nice and easy.<br> - Somethin' smells good.<br> - Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.<br> The bosses would come<br> from all over the place:<br> Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...<br> all over the Midwest.<br> And they would meet in the back<br> of this produce market in Kansas City.<br> I mean, nobody even knew it.<br> One of the guys made<br> his mother do all the cookin'.<br> - Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?<br> - Jerry Steriano?<br> Now, these old greaseballs<br> might not look it...<br> but believe me...<br> these are the guys<br> who secretly control Las Vegas.<br> Mama, that man's here again.<br> Because they control<br> the Teamsters Union.<br> And that's where you had to go if you<br> wanted to borrow money to buy a casino.<br> - Would you put in shrimp?<br> - I would.<br> Here you are, gentlemen.<br> Nobody got a Teamsters' loan<br> unless the guys in this room...<br> knew they were gonna get<br> their little suitcases.<br> Guys like this antique over here,<br> out of Detroit.<br> Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,<br> the outfit's top boss.<br> You got a round figure on it?<br> - Definitely the most important guy in this room.<br> - About 20 pounds.<br> - That's around 700,000.<br> - Uh-huh, good.<br> I know it's<br> a little early for Las Vegas...<br> But I do want to welcome the ladies<br> and gentlemen of the gaming industry.<br> As far as the world<br> was concerned...<br> Andy Stone, the head of<br> the Teamsters' Pension Fund...<br> - was a legitimate guy.<br> - This is a very auspicious occasion.<br> - A powerful man.<br> - Philip, if you would rise.<br> He even played golf<br> with the president.<br> On behalf of the Teamsters'<br> Pension Fund...<br> - it is my pleasure to present to you...<br> - But Andy also took orders.<br> And when he was told to give<br> a pension fund loan to Philip Green...<br> this check for $62,700,000...<br> for the new Tangiers.<br> He did what he was told.<br> Now, here was<br> the perfect front man.<br> What the fuck else could he be?<br> He didn't know too much.<br> He didn't want to know<br> too much...<br> especially that the bosses made<br> the Teamsters lend him the money.<br> He wanted to believe<br> the Teamsters...<br> gave him all that fuckin' money<br> 'cause he was smart.<br> I know full well how much competition<br> we have in this great city.<br> And where they got Green from?<br> Who the fuck knows?<br> All I know is that Green was<br> an Arizona real estate hustler...<br> who barely had<br> enough gas money...<br> to come and pick up<br> his own fuckin' check.<br> And of course it was<br> the bosses' man...<br> Andy Stone,<br> who gave all the orders.<br> Not the chairman<br> of the fuckin' board, Philip Green.<br> I understand.<br> I understand.<br> Now all they needed was...<br> somebody they could trust<br> to run the casino.<br> And who better than Ace? I mean, he was<br> already in Vegas a couple years...<br> and he had<br> the fuckin' place clocked.<br> But typical Ace, give him a shot<br> at runnin' a casino...<br> and he tries<br> to talk you out of it.<br> I don't know if I could do this<br> even if I wanted to.<br> The Gaming Commission<br> would never give me a license.<br> I have at least two dozen<br> gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.<br> You don't have to have a license<br> to work in a casino.<br> All you gotta do<br> is apply for one.<br> The state law says that<br> you can work in a casino...<br> while they're processing<br> your application.<br> They got a ten-year backlog.<br> What happens when<br> they do find out?<br> Why would they<br> want to find out?<br> We're puttin' a hundred million into this<br> desert. Why would they want to lock us out?<br> They'll never find out. All you gotta do<br> is keep changing your job title.<br> Like, uh, from Casino Executive<br> to Food and Beverage Chairman.<br> They take your application,<br> they put it at the bottom of the pile.<br> I know guys been workin' there<br> for 30 years, don't have a license.<br> It's a tough proposition, Andy.<br> You know if I did it,<br> I'd have to run it my way.<br> You got it.<br> I'm serious, no interference.<br> Nobody's gonna interfere<br> with your running the casino.<br> I guarantee it.<br> And that's how<br> they got Ace to take over.<br> They wanted him because Ace ate,<br> slept and breathed gambling.<br> They worked out<br> a real cute job title too...<br> Tangiers Public Relations Director.<br> But the only thing he ever<br> directed was the casino.<br> He made his first bet when he was<br> But he didn't bet<br> like you or me.<br> You know, havin' some fun<br> with it, shit like that.<br> Where the hell<br> did you learn how to deal?<br> He bet like a fuckin'<br> brain surgeon.<br> Place the checks properly.<br> - That's the way you do it.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He had to know everything,<br> this guy.<br> He'd find out the kind<br> of inside stuff nobody else knew...<br> and that's what he'd put<br> his money on.<br> Even back home, years ago...<br> when we were first hangin' out...<br> he'd know if the quarterback<br> was on coke...<br> I'll take Columbia for 20.<br> - If his girlfriend was knocked up.<br> - Twenty dimes on Columbia.<br> He'd get the wind velocity<br> so he could judge the field goals.<br> He even figured out<br> the different bounce...<br> you got off the different kinds<br> of wood they used...<br> on college basketball courts,<br> you know?<br> He'd be workin'<br> on this shit day and night.<br> There was nothing about a game<br> he was gonna bet that he didn't know.<br> Ace got down at six.<br> Get me down at six.<br> Season after season...<br> the prick was the only<br> guaranteed winner I ever knew.<br> But he was so serious<br> about it all...<br> that I don't think<br> he ever enjoyed himself.<br> But that's just the way he was.<br> But back then, the bosses<br> didn't give a fuck...<br> about whether<br> he enjoyed himself or not.<br> To them, he was<br> a cash register.<br> All they had to do was<br> ring the bell and take money.<br> Especially Remo...<br> who was a fuckin' degenerate<br> gambler who always lost...<br> Cazzo!<br> All those fuckin' sweeps.<br> - Unless Ace made his bets.<br> - Enough now!<br> Ace made more money<br> for them on a weekend...<br> than I could do heisting<br> joints for a month.<br> Whatever Ace picked up<br> on the street, he told Remo.<br> I mean, fixed fights,<br> doped horses...<br> crooked fuckin' zebras,<br> locked-in point spreads.<br> He told fuckin' Remo everything.<br> And to tell you the truth,<br> I don't blame him.<br> - Hey!<br> - Keepin' Remo happy with money...<br> was the greatest insurance<br> policy in the world.<br> Son of a bitch!<br> How the hell did you get<br> Oklahoma-Michigan?<br> Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi...<br> How the hell'd you do it?<br> Well, that's why<br> they paid so well.<br> You see?<br> Never tells me nothin'.<br> What do we got on<br> for next week?<br> Well, it's a little too early. I'd say<br> Thursday would be good. Is that all right?<br> - Okay, you'll come by the house?<br> - I'll come by.<br> Keep it up? Okay, Ace?<br> Hey, Nick. Vien acca.<br> - I'll be right out.<br> - T'aggia parla.<br> Nicky, see that guy?<br> Keep a good eye on him.<br> He's makin'<br> a lot of money for us.<br> And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of<br> money for us, so keep a good eye on him.<br> Not like your fuckin' friends<br> out there that... without brains.<br> - Okay?<br> - All right.<br> - Mi raccomando.<br> - Yeah. Want me to take this for you?<br> So now,<br> on top of everything else...<br> I gotta make sure nobody fucks around<br> with the golden Jew.<br> Chase, couple of shooters<br> for the ladies.<br> Yeah, we made a great pair.<br> I made book and Nicky made sure<br> we always collected.<br> The old men loved us,<br> and why not?<br> - They all made money with us.<br> - They payin'?<br> - How did Nicky collect?<br> - They pay every week, like they're supposed to.<br> - Don't ask.<br> - And where the fuck is the money? I don't see any money.<br> - Hi, Melissa, Heidi.<br> - Hi, Sam.<br> Who's this guy?<br> - Get the fuck out of here. It was nine. I laid nine.<br> - It was eight.<br> Ace, tell him the line<br> on the Bear game.<br> - Eight.<br> - If he don't know, nobody knows.<br> - Told you it was eight.<br> - How come I laid nine?<br> 'Cause you're a jag-off.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - What?<br> - Is this yours? Your pen?<br> - Yeah, that's my pen. Why?<br> No, it's a nice pen.<br> I just didn't know whose it was.<br> I thought it was yours.<br> I didn't want it to get lost.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Why don't you take that fuckin' pen...<br> and shove it up your ass,<br> you fuckin' jag-off.<br> - Well, I was just offering you the...<br> - This fuckin' assho...<br> Look out, Joe. Look out.<br> What's that?<br> You hear a little girl, Frankie?<br> Hear a little girl, Ace?<br> Is that a little fuckin' girl?<br> What happened<br> to the fuckin' tough guy...<br> - told my friend to stick it<br> up his fuckin' ass?<br> Nicky, take it easy. Nicky, Nicky.<br> While I was trying<br> to figure out why the guy was saying...<br> what he was saying,<br> Nicky just hit him.<br> No matter how big a guy might be,<br> Nicky would take him on.<br> You beat Nicky with fists,<br> he comes back with a bat.<br> You beat him with a knife,<br> he comes back with a gun.<br> And if you beat him with a gun,<br> you better kill him...<br> because he'll keep coming<br> back and back...<br> until one of you is dead.<br> Listen,<br> with me protectin' Ace...<br> he made a fortune<br> for the bosses.<br> I mean, that's<br> what got him to Vegas.<br> He was a money machine.<br> A tremendous earner<br> for these guys.<br> As soon as he took over,<br> he doubled the fuckin' drop.<br> With Ace, the casino<br> never saw so much money.<br> And the bosses,<br> they couldn't be happier.<br> # I got $700 #<br> # Don't you mess with me #<br> # But you know I'm down #<br> # Everybody knows I'm down ##<br> In Vegas, I had to keep<br> a few juiced-in local cowboys working.<br> They were close to the,<br> you know, good old boys.<br> I mean, without us, these guys,<br> they'd still be shoveling mule shit.<br> Ward, you've got to keep<br> a cleaner space.<br> If you need Mr. Clean,<br> page him, all right?<br> Won't happen again, Sam.<br> - Mr. Rothstein.<br> - Mr. Rothstein. Won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.<br> Is this guy just another dumb fucking<br> white man, or what? What's the story?<br> - You need this guy.<br> - Can't get rid of him?<br> He's juiced in.<br> He's the County Commissioner's cousin.<br> I wouldn't give the bum<br> a mop job.<br> But still, I had no choice.<br> I had to take care of them.<br> These yokels ran the state.<br> Thank you very much,<br> Senator.<br> - They passed the laws, they owned the courts.<br> - Hi, Ace. Hey, I need a room.<br> - I had dozens of politicians and state officials...<br> - The Cedar Room.<br> Coming through that place<br> every week.<br> - Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.<br> - Certainly.<br> Why not make him happy?<br> ...the Presidential Suite.<br> For politicians like our State Senator<br> up there, everything was on the house.<br> These guys won their comp life<br> when they got elected...<br> so, hey, why not<br> take advantage of it.<br> Still, the politicians came cheap.<br> We could handle them.<br> It's a whale<br> like K.K. Ichikawa...<br> who plays $30,000 a hand<br> in baccarat...<br> that's the one<br> you really gotta watch.<br> He plays fast and big<br> and he has the cash and the credit...<br> to turn out your lights.<br> About a year ago he cleaned out a couple<br> of casinos in the Cayman Islands.<br> Downstairs he takes us<br> for two million...<br> and upstairs he takes free<br> soap, shampoo and towels.<br> Another billionaire cheapskate<br> who loved his free rooms...<br> free private jets and<br> two million of our money.<br> But we got him back.<br> I had our pilot tell him<br> the plane was on the fritz.<br> I don't know what the hell went wrong.<br> I'm awfully sorry.<br> I can't understand it. These mechanical<br> things, you know they happen.<br> Hey, but better here than<br> up there, you know what I mean.<br> Then he missed the commercial<br> flights connecting with Japan.<br> I can't believe that there's<br> a convention; there's no room.<br> We got him back with a whole floor<br> of rooms to himself.<br> - I'm sorry you missed your plane.<br> - Glad to get to know you.<br> Oh, no. No gambling.<br> And once he was back,<br> he played small.<br> He bet 1,000 a hand,<br> instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.<br> ...to the bank<br> with a natural lead over a five.<br> But I knew the trick<br> with whales like Ichikawa...<br> was that they can't bet<br> small for long.<br> He didn't think of it<br> as winning 10,000...<br> he thought of it<br> as losing 90,000.<br> So, he upped his bets.<br> Until he dropped his winnings back<br> and gave up a million of his own cash.<br> In the casino, the cardinal rule<br> is to keep them playing...<br> and keep them coming back.<br> The longer they play,<br> the more they lose.<br> In the end, we get it all.<br> # Goddamn it<br> Trying to make it real #<br> # Compared to what #<br> # Sock it to me #<br> In Vegas, everybody's<br> gotta watch everybody else.<br> Six. All right,<br> who's gonna give me that?<br> Since the players are looking<br> to beat the casino...<br> Each and every roll,<br> all right.<br> - The dealers are watching the players...<br> - Six.<br> - Fake a six.<br> - The boxmen are watching the dealers.<br> The floormen are watching<br> the boxmen...<br> the pit bosses are watching<br> the floormen...<br> the shift bosses are watching<br> the pit bosses...<br> the casino manager is watching<br> the shift bosses...<br> I'm watching the casino manager...<br> and the eye in the sky<br> is watching us all.<br> Plus, we had<br> a dozen guys up there...<br> most of them ex-cheats, who knew<br> every trick in the house.<br> # Tryin' to make it real<br> compared to what #<br> Yes!<br> - Very nice.<br> - I told you I was hot tonight.<br> Lookin' good.<br> Lookin' good.<br> Let's go.<br> This is for Ginger. Come on.<br> Let me have a hundred<br> on your hard ten.<br> Hundred on your hard ten.<br> Thank you.<br> Here we go now.<br> Yeeeow!<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - The dice...<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.<br> - You were great.<br> Thanks. Take care, Steve.<br> Take chances, drive fast.<br> This hundred is for you, love.<br> Thanks for your time.<br> - Come on.<br> - What's the matter?<br> What do you mean? I made a lot<br> of money for you, I want my cut.<br> What money? I've seen<br> you stealing from me.<br> What money?<br> Look at the stack of chips.<br> - I want my half.<br> - I've been watching you all night.<br> - I want my money.<br> - Your bag is full of fucking chips.<br> - I didn't steal anything from you.<br> - Get lost!<br> Get lost? Get lost?<br> Yes! Yes!<br> - Well, how about that?<br> - Come on!<br> # Slippin' and a-slidin' #<br> Changin' and a-hidin' #<br> # Been told a long time ago #<br> # I been told<br> Baby, you've been born #<br> # I won't be your fool no more<br> Oww #<br> # Baby, oh, baby #<br> # My sweet baby #<br> # You're the one #<br> What a move.<br> I fell in love right there.<br> But in Vegas, for a girl<br> like Ginger, love costs money.<br> # What's different about him #<br> # I don't really know #<br> I'm gonna go powder my nose.<br> # No matter how I try #<br> # I just can't make him cry #<br> - Ginger's mission in life was money.<br> - I'll be right back.<br> - See you, Ginger.<br> - Okay, thank you for asking.<br> She was a queen<br> around the casino.<br> She brought in high rollers...<br> and helped them spread<br> around a lot of money.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hey, Ginger. How you doing?<br> Great, and I have something for you.<br> You got me covered?<br> - And you do. Thank you very much.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Who didn't want Ginger?<br> She was one of the best known...<br> best liked and<br> most respected hustlers in town.<br> Smart hustlers like her<br> could keep a guy awake...<br> for two or three days<br> before sending him home broke...<br> to the little woman<br> and his bank examiners.<br> # You only make me glad #<br> # Better listen, little girl #<br> # You're goin' walkin'<br> down the street #<br> # I ain't got no love #<br> Any change?<br> Oh, I hit a few games<br> on the way back.<br> But that was all bullshit.<br> She just pocketed the cash.<br> # This heart of stone #<br> - How you doin' tonight?<br> - Good.<br> - How are you?<br> - Uh, beat.<br> - Ginger had the hustlers code.<br> - Take one for you.<br> - Thank you.<br> - She knew how to take care of people.<br> And that's what Vegas<br> is all about.<br> - Sixty-eight hundred.<br> - Thanks.<br> - It's kickback city.<br> - Have a good night.<br> Thank you. You too.<br> - She took care of the dealers...<br> - Hey, Mitch.<br> Pit bosses, floor managers...<br> but, mostly, she took care<br> of the valet parkers...<br> the guys who could get you anything<br> and take care of anything.<br> Ginger took care of the parkers...<br> because they took care<br> of the security guards...<br> - who took care of the metro cops, who let her operate.<br> - I need that stuff tonight.<br> - No problem.<br> - You are a doll.<br> The valet parking job<br> was such a money-maker...<br> they had to pay off the hotel manager<br> just to get the concession.<br> But one thing<br> I just could never understand...<br> was that she could have<br> everything under control...<br> except for her old pimp<br> boyfriend, Lester Diamond.<br> Gin, you know I got other people<br> in this, they got partners.<br> I want you to understand<br> that I am looking out for you...<br> in this thing, okay?<br> You're gonna get yours back,<br> and you're gonna get back first, okay?<br> - All right, yeah.<br> - Where you going?<br> Where are you? You're<br> in that place. Where are you?<br> - I'm here.<br> - No, you're not.<br> Where are you?<br> Where are you?<br> I'm always here for you.<br> - You're my woman.<br> - I know.<br> The Ginger I knew wouldn't<br> even look at this creep.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Yeah.<br> He was a moocher,<br> a card cheat...<br> a country club golf hustler,<br> a scumbag.<br> - Chasing dentists for a few bucks.<br> - Careful.<br> The guy was always broke.<br> He always had a story.<br> And somehow she could never<br> turn him down.<br> The way Ginger saw it, I guess,<br> was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.<br> Somebody had<br> to take care of him.<br> But nobody<br> had to take care of Nicky.<br> If you find any cash in there,<br> we'll whack it up with you.<br> I mean, he took care<br> of himself only too well.<br> - That's why every badge...<br> - I folded these things beautifully.<br> - Back home wanted to nail him.<br> - I would appreciate a little respect.<br> - Look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.<br> - Jesus Christ.<br> # Volare #<br> Even after a little vacation,<br> they hassled him at the airport.<br> I mean, Frank Marino was there<br> to meet him, but so were the cops.<br> This time they wanted<br> to pinch him...<br> - for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.<br> - Will you help me fold these?<br> They were ready to blame him for<br> anything, no matter where it happened.<br> - Put your things away.<br> - And they were usually right.<br> - Hold it, hold it. Here.<br> - Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.<br> - And he didn't give a damn who knew it.<br> - Come on, there we go.<br> Look at this. Beautiful!<br> I mean, that's what worried me. 'Cause it<br> turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.<br> - All right, we're clear.<br> - There's more.<br> There's a couple stuck in there.<br> I know there's more.<br> - I'm telling you, they're out!<br> - Come on.<br> Don't get so defensive,<br> it could be stuck in your hair.<br> What's that?<br> Huh, what's that?<br> There's no more.<br> Thanks, hon.<br> I couldn't wait to get<br> my hands on Vegas.<br> But the bosses didn't send me<br> out there to have a good time.<br> They sent me out there to make sure<br> that nobody fucked with Ace.<br> And nobody interfered<br> with the fuckin' skim.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, how you doin'?<br> Hey, Sammy.<br> - Boy, look at this place, huh?<br> - Incredible.<br> Welcome to Vegas.<br> - Okay, Sammy.<br> - Something, huh?<br> Ginger.<br> Holy shit. What've you<br> been doing out here?<br> Honey, come here.<br> This is Jennifer and Nick,<br> they're dear friends of mine.<br> - Hi, Jennifer.<br> - A pleasure.<br> Okay, Sammy.<br> After we ate,<br> we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...<br> and we took a ride to talk.<br> And then, he hit me with it.<br> What do you think about me<br> moving out here?<br> What's the matter?<br> You got a problem with that?<br> - No, of course not.<br> - You mean, I have your permission?<br> Sure, you have my permission.<br> But I just gotta tell you...<br> it's no joke out here,<br> it's no joke.<br> You gotta keep a low profile.<br> It's not like back home. Right off<br> the bat, they don't like guys like us.<br> And this sheriff's<br> a real cowboy.<br> Even the coppers aren't afraid<br> to bury people out in the desert here.<br> I don't care. I wanna get away<br> from back home for a while.<br> I'm tired of that shit<br> back there.<br> Look at this place.<br> It's made of money.<br> You know what the best part is?<br> Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.<br> There's nobody here to see us.<br> Everybody's back home.<br> Nick, I gotta tell you.<br> I got pinched twice for no reason.<br> I really gotta be careful.<br> I'm running a licensed place,<br> everything's legit.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> I'm not gonna do anything.<br> I'm especially not gonna<br> involve you in anything.<br> Ace saw Vegas one way...<br> - You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?<br> - Of course.<br> But I saw it another.<br> I saw it as untouched.<br> I mean, they had bookies, pimps...<br> and drug dealers<br> I could shake down.<br> Who the fuck<br> were they gonna run to?<br> So I started gettin'<br> everybody in line.<br> Best of all,<br> for the first time in my life...<br> I figured out a way<br> not to lose.<br> Yeah, he had<br> a foolproof scheme, all right.<br> It wasn't very scientific,<br> but it worked.<br> When he won, he collected;<br> when he lost, he told the bookies<br> to go fuck themselves.<br> What were they gonna do,<br> muscle Nicky?<br> - Hey, how you doin'?<br> - How you doin'?<br> - You got that thing for me?<br> - What thing?<br> Oh, Nicky. I thought<br> you was layin'.<br> No, no, I'm takin'.<br> I was takin'.<br> - You sure?<br> - I'm positive.<br> - I'm a little confused.<br> - You're a little confused?<br> Maybe if I stick your fuckin'<br> face through this window...<br> you'll get unconfused.<br> - Gimme the fuckin' money.<br> - I'm sorry, Nick.<br> I didn't mean anything by it.<br> That's why you had it ready.<br> You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?<br> - My fuckin' head.<br> - Smarten up.<br> And now Nicholas Santoro will come up<br> and tell us about our first president.<br> George Washington was born...<br> But still,<br> it was nice and quiet for a while.<br> Ginger and I presented<br> Nicky and Jennifer all over town...<br> like regular Ozzie and Harriets.<br> Beautiful, you got<br> a beautiful swing.<br> Ace got my son, little Nicky,<br> involved in Little League.<br> Turned out to be one<br> of the other coaches...<br> was a fuckin'<br> metro intelligence cop.<br> But it didn't matter.<br> It was all about the kids.<br> He's gotta realize that everything<br> can't be a home run that he does.<br> That's exactly what<br> I keep tellin' him...<br> but that's the kind of kid he is.<br> And Nicky being Nicky,<br> he made his presence known.<br> Especially at the casino,<br> where he definitely did not work...<br> people got the message.<br> Me, that's why<br> the bosses sent me out here.<br> They wanted me to make sure none<br> of the other crews robbed the joint.<br> Like these two fuckin'<br> balloon heads over here.<br> They were gonna try to bang us<br> out of 200 fuckin' grand...<br> - yeah, right, I'm sure.<br> - Hey! How are you?<br> How are you?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I'm over here now.<br> - You're over here?<br> - Yeah, I'm over here with them.<br> We're waiting on Carmine.<br> Yeah, we're looking<br> for Carmine.<br> He was here before. He had<br> a suitcase and then he left.<br> - Carmine left?<br> - Carmine left?<br> He's gone?<br> He's not here?<br> Carmine's out?<br> I think maybe he went<br> across the street...<br> or somewhere else<br> or somethin'.<br> Well, listen, good luck<br> with the joint.<br> - Ah, thanks, Eddie.<br> - Yeah, lots of luck.<br> - Yeah, good luck to you too.<br> - Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.<br> Yeah, they don't<br> need those anymore.<br> Guys from other crews<br> got away with a warning.<br> Everybody else, watch out.<br> Like these yokels here...<br> who never heard of Nicky<br> or the bosses back home.<br> 'Cause they're the morons<br> who give you the most trouble.<br> Even after we'd catch them,<br> they'd try sneaking back...<br> with beards<br> and wigs and fake noses.<br> You can spot these assholes<br> by watching the way they bet.<br> Like this guy,<br> he's bettin' lavender chips...<br> at 500 each with only<br> one little problem...<br> he's always guessed right.<br> If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy,<br> he'd have been tougher to spot.<br> But in the end,<br> they're all greedy.<br> # I got a feelin'<br> about the future #<br> # And it ain't too good<br> I know that #<br> I saw that the dealer was weak,<br> but he wasn't in on it.<br> He just wasn't<br> protecting his hand.<br> He was lifting<br> his hole card way too high.<br> Now, here's this guy reading<br> the dealer's hole card...<br> and signaling his buddy<br> at this table.<br> And that's just what<br> these hustlers look for.<br> They cruise from casino to casino<br> looking for weak dealers...<br> the way lions<br> look for weak antelope.<br> Operator, this is Mr. R.<br> Get me Armstrong and Friday<br> over at pit two right away.<br> BJ 19, second base, the beard.<br> Operator, I need Mr. Happy.

That's a lot of money<br> to be counting out in public.<br> Why don't I take him...<br> over to the office<br> and verify it?<br> A little privacy.<br> And by the way...<br> send over a nice bottle<br> of champagne on ice.<br> - Sure will.<br> - Real special.<br> - By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.<br> - Hi.<br> - Having a good time?<br> - Yes.<br> You want to count<br> the money in privacy.<br> I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.<br> Can I get my winnings?<br> Look what they did<br> to my hand, man.<br> All right,<br> I'm gonna give you a choice:<br> You can either have the money and<br> the hammer or you can walk out of here.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I just wanna get out of here.<br> And don't forget to tell your friends<br> what happens if they fuck around here.<br> - I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.<br> - You're fuckin' right you made a bad mistake.<br> 'Cause if you come back here,<br> and we catch either one of you...<br> we're gonna break your heads,<br> and you won't walk out of here.<br> You see that fuckin' saw?<br> We're gonna use it. You got it?<br> - Get out of here.<br> - Thank you.<br> Throw him in the alley and tell<br> the cops he got hit by a car.<br> Within no time,<br> everything was set in place.<br> We got rid<br> of the freelance scamsters...<br> the per was way up,<br> the gods were happy.<br> And I decided<br> to complicate my life.<br> For a guy who likes sure things...<br> I was about to bet the rest<br> of my life on a real long shot.<br> We're not gettin' any younger.<br> Don't you think it's time?<br> Aren't you gettin' tired<br> of all this shit?<br> What, are you trying<br> to handicap me?<br> I'm gonna do you one better.<br> I'm tryin' to marry you.<br> You wanna marry me?<br> I'm serious.<br> I wanna settle down.<br> I want a family.<br> You got the wrong girl, Sam.<br> I know I'd be a good father,<br> you'd be a good mother.<br> You don't know me.<br> You've known me two,<br> three months.<br> I'm 43 years old.<br> I don't want to wait.<br> I know you well enough<br> to know that I really love you.<br> And I can't think<br> of anybody better to be with.<br> And I don't feel like<br> waiting anymore.<br> You know a lot of happily<br> married people, Sam?<br> 'Cause I don't.<br> Yeah, I know all that.<br> I care about you, okay.<br> But I just don't have those kind<br> of feelings for you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm not in love with you.<br> - All right, all right.<br> - Understand?<br> Sam, I'm sorry.<br> No, I... I...<br> I mean... I can grow.<br> As long as there's a mutual respect,<br> that kind of thing can grow.<br> I'm realistic.<br> I can accept that.<br> What is love anyway?<br> It's a mutual respect.<br> It's a devotion.<br> It's a caring<br> from one person to another.<br> And if we could set up<br> some kind of foundation...<br> based on that mutual respect...<br> I feel eventually you<br> would care enough about me...<br> that I could live<br> with that.<br> If it doesn't work out,<br> doesn't play out...<br> then what happens to me?<br> You know I'm doing well now,<br> and I'm gonna do even better.<br> And so whatever happens...<br> if it doesn't work out<br> between us...<br> I'm gonna make sure you're okay<br> for the rest of your life.<br> And if there are kids,<br> especially...<br> I'll take care of you<br> better than you'd ever imagine.<br> What are you pitching me?<br> Just what I said,<br> you'll be set up...<br> for the rest of your life,<br> that I can promise you.<br> Want to take a chance?<br> When I married Ginger,<br> I knew all the stories.<br> But I didn't give a fuck.<br> I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.<br> I can change her.<br> It was typical Ace.<br> He invited the biggest people<br> in town, and he knew they'd show.<br> Because he knew they all wanted<br> somethin' from him.<br> With Ace, nobody ever got<br> a free ride, even Ginger.<br> With her, he still<br> covered his bets.<br> They had to have the baby<br> before they could get married.<br> He even made Jenny and me<br> watch Amy for a few days...<br> when they went<br> on their honeymoon.<br> But I didn't mind,<br> we loved the kid.<br> Can you feel my eyes on you?<br> Can you feel me<br> look into your heart?<br> Can you feel me<br> in the pit of your stomach?<br> Can you feel me in you?<br> In your heart?<br> Don't make me come there.<br> Answer me.<br> I love you.<br> But, baby, do you know<br> that I love you too?<br> - No, Lester.<br> - Do you know that?<br> This is the best thing I can do<br> for my life right now.<br> That's right.<br> So it's going to be okay.<br> Promise?<br> I wish you all the luck<br> in the world.<br> You do?<br> Yeah, I do.

The jewelry's<br> not so bad either.<br> We shouldn't keep this in the house.<br> We gotta put it in the bank.<br> Come on. Can I keep this one<br> in the house?<br> Pay attention to me.<br> - What I'm gonna tell you is very important.<br> - Okay.<br> All this stuff<br> doesn't mean anything.<br> Money, this doesn't mean<br> anything without trust.<br> I have to be able<br> to trust you with my life.<br> With over a million<br> in cash and jewels...<br> tucked in a bank in Vegas, only<br> for Ginger, she was secure and happy.<br> She loved that shit.<br> But a guy in my line of work has<br> to have a lot of payoff cash around.<br> Crooked cops and kidnappers,<br> they don't take checks.<br> Need any help with that,<br> Mr. Collins?<br> So I put two million in cash<br> in a Los Angeles bank...<br> under the name<br> of Mr. And Mrs. Tom Collins.<br> This was strictly my shakedown<br> and kidnapping money.<br> And since I'd either be in jail<br> or locked in a closet...<br> when I needed the money<br> the most...<br> I gave Ginger the only key to the cash<br> that could get me back alive.<br> - # I'll take you there #<br> - # I'm callin', callin' #<br> # Callin' for mercy #<br> - # I'll take you there #<br> - # Mercy, mercy #<br> # I'll take you there #<br> This is a signature card.<br> So once she signs those papers,<br> she'll be the only person...<br> to have total access to the box,<br> no one else, including myself?<br> That's right.<br> That's the way you wanted it.<br> Sam, let me ask you a question.<br> You must really trust your wife.<br> Yeah, sure I do. Why?<br> It's good.<br> It's just unusual.<br> Tell you the truth,<br> so many of my clients don't.<br> - # Let me take you there #<br> - # I'll take you there #<br> - # Ain't no smilin' faces #<br> - # I'll take you there ##<br> # Never will I know happiness #<br> With Ginger and the money<br> in place, I felt covered.<br> And to play it safe,<br> I switched job titles again...<br> and made myself<br> Food and Beverage Director.<br> This way nobody would bother me<br> about a license.<br> I mean Vegas was<br> like a dream for me.<br> Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming<br> his own kind of Vegas.<br> I put money out on the street<br> chargin' three points a week.<br> - Don't make us come lookin' for you.<br> - Juice to the fuckin' dealers.<br> You won't have to look<br> for me.<br> I appreciate it.<br> Thanks, Nicky.<br> They were degenerate gamblers,<br> coke freaks.<br> In no time I had half the dealers<br> in the Tangiers in my pocket.<br> Then, I started bustin' out<br> high-stakes poker players.<br> It was so obvious.<br> - All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics were<br> signal-happy. - I'm gonna open for 500.<br> Signaling back and forth.<br> Why you cryin'<br> with two loaves of bread under your arm?<br> Nicky thought nobody was watching him.<br> But he was wrong.<br> And I didn't want<br> any of those agents near my place.<br> - Four aces.<br> - I can't believe this.<br> If I didn't have<br> bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.<br> I wished to God Nicky and<br> his whole crew would just get lost.<br> What am I gonna do?<br> Go back home and start a war?<br> Nicky's a made guy, and I'm not.<br> I can't do that.<br> Be careful. Gaming agents<br> are all over the place.<br> So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed<br> to get lucky in this place?<br> You've been lucky all week.<br> They're looking to nail you.<br> Ace was so fuckin' worried<br> about his casino...<br> he forgot what we were doin'<br> out here in the first place.<br> A million times I wanted to yell<br> in his fuckin' ear...<br> "This is Las Vegas.<br> We're supposed to be<br> out here robbin'...<br> you dumb fuckin' hebe. "<br> I don't give a shit<br> who he's connected to.<br> Tell him to take<br> his fuckin' feet off the table.<br> What's he think this is,<br> a goddamned sawdust joint?<br> Sir, would you mind<br> taking your feet off the table?<br> Yeah, I would mind.<br> I'm having a bad night.<br> Fuckin' asshole won't budge.<br> Call security.<br> - How are you?<br> - Good. How are you?<br> Wanna do me a favor? Take your feet off<br> the table and put your shoes back on.<br> Fuck you!<br> I want you to exit this guy<br> off the premises...<br> and use his head<br> to open the fucking door.<br> Sir, you're gonna have to leave.<br> Wanna come with us outside?<br> Bullshit. I ain't goin'<br> anywhere with you.<br> - Bullshit. You're outta here.<br> - Fuck you!<br> You know who you're<br> fucking with? Do you?<br> You fucking faggot! Do you know<br> who you're fucking with?<br> Leave me alone!<br> - Come on!<br> - You guys are killing me!<br> Sure enough, an hour later,<br> I get the call.<br> Ace, what happened over there?<br> Did you know that guy was with me?<br> No, I didn't know that.<br> But you know what he did?<br> I walked over to him politely,<br> and he tells me to fuck myself.<br> - Then he called me a faggot.<br> - What?<br> - I threw that cocksucker out.<br> - Hey, come here.<br> You called my friend a faggot?<br> You tell him to fuck himself?<br> - Is that what you did?<br> Tell him to go fuck himself?<br> Come here. Come here.<br> You go over there.<br> You apologize.<br> You better hope<br> he lets you back in.<br> If you get outta line again,<br> I'll smash your head so hard...<br> you won't be able<br> to get that cowboy hat on.<br> Fuckin' hick.<br> Sammy, listen.<br> This guy obviously doesn't know<br> who he was talking to.<br> He doesn't know that<br> we're dear friends.<br> I mean, he's already<br> very sorry.<br> But if you could do me a favor<br> and let him back in...<br> I swear he'll never<br> get out of line again.<br> If he does it again,<br> he's out for good.<br> I don't care what it is,<br> I'll never let him in the place again.<br> I'm sorry about this, really.<br> All right, Ace?<br> Thanks, pal.<br> You took your boots off?<br> You put your feet on the table?<br> You shit-kickin',<br> stinky-horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker, you!<br> You fuck me up over there,<br> I'll stick you in the desert.<br> - Go over and apologize.<br> - Nicky, I'm sorry.<br> # You're dear to me<br> Yes, sirree #<br> You know,<br> Ace could be a very touchy guy.<br> Especially when<br> he got bigger in town.<br> Like when he hired that Jonathan and David<br> and their tigers away from the Palace...<br> by building them a new stage<br> and giving them a Rolls-Royce.<br> But I'll tell you, he knew<br> how to bring in the crowds.<br> He knew all<br> the fuckin' angles.<br> He brought over the whole<br> "Femme Fatale" show from Paris...<br> but he forgot how lazy them<br> European dancing broads can get.<br> He had to weigh 'em in once a week to make<br> sure they didn't blow up like balloons.<br> She's still eight pounds over.<br> - What's the reason for this?<br> - Mr. Rothstein, sir.<br> Never mind the "sir. "<br> Why is she eight pounds over?<br> I'm trying to use respect.<br> Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.<br> Well, sometimes when you put<br> that pressure point on them...<br> All you do is give me answers.<br> Just give me the right answer.<br> I guess she's frightened. If she doesn't<br> lose weight she may get fired.<br> That's right, she will get fired.<br> Send her back to Paris...<br> - It's been our policy...<br> - Just stop everything!<br> - This woman's an institution.<br> - That's the problem. She's lazy.<br> Hey,<br> I gotta give the guy credit.<br> I mean, he does<br> the most obvious thing.<br> This is the only town in the country<br> where a bookie joint is legit.<br> So why not take advantage, right?<br> So, he took bookie joints<br> off the street...<br> and then opened them up<br> inside the casino.<br> Within a few years<br> by doing all of this...<br> he had every casino on the strip<br> trying to copy off of him.<br> Between my innovations...<br> # Look like they're taking<br> some cat to jail #<br> and Nicky's dedication<br> to his job...<br> # Steamboats are comin' and<br> they're splashing and goin' #<br> I soon had the best<br> operation on the strip.<br> # Moon is shinin'<br> on friends below #<br> You gotta watch yourself.<br> There's a lot of heat on you already.<br> Why?<br> Somebody's complainin'?<br> I'm hearing things<br> from security.<br> The sheriff's lookin'<br> to put you in the Black Book.<br> That Black Book<br> is a bunch of bullshit.<br> They got two names<br> from the whole country...<br> and one of 'em<br> is still Al Capone.<br> If they put you in that book,<br> you're gonna be in trouble.<br> You will not be able<br> to walk into a casino.<br> I'm trying to make a living,<br> that's all.<br> I'm just tellin' you.<br> Don't say I didn't warn you.<br> All right.<br> Mrs. Rothstein,<br> straight ahead. Very nice.<br> Thank you.<br> For his hard work<br> and dedication...<br> and the new life blood<br> he has instilled in Las Vegas...<br> Sam has established himself<br> as an indispensable member...<br> of the gaming community.<br> As the head of the<br> Tangiers Gaming Corporation...<br> it's my pleasure<br> to welcome Sam Rothstein...<br> to the Vegas Valley<br> Country Club.<br> Back home, they would've put me<br> in jail for what I'm doing.<br> But out here,<br> they're giving me awards.<br> It is with great pleasure that I accept<br> this certificate of appreciation...<br> for charitable donations<br> to greater Las Vegas.<br> Congratulations, sweetheart.<br> Sam raised more than<br> we've ever raised before.<br> But my greatest pleasure was watching<br> my wife, Ginger, work the room.<br> - They all loved her.<br> How could you not love her?<br> She could be the most<br> charming woman you ever saw.<br> People loved<br> to be around her.<br> You've got to bring Amy<br> to Sasha's birthday party.<br> We'd love to have you there.<br> - Yes, okay.<br> - Great.<br> She made everybody feel good.<br> # That's Stella by starlight #<br> Congratulations, Sam.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?<br> - Hi.<br> You're one of the most<br> gorgeous women I've ever seen.<br> You're a lucky man,<br> Mr. Rothstein.<br> Thank you.<br> Thanks for that compliment.<br> He was a young kid<br> from the casino.<br> Nice kid.<br> Bright boy.<br> What balls on this fuckin' kid!<br> The next day I fired him.<br> Ginger had that effect on people.<br> I think she even encouraged them.<br> Do you wanna see this one?<br> Ahhhh!<br> Daddy gave me all this jewelry<br> because he loves me so much.<br> - But as much as they loved her...<br> - Oh, fabulous!<br> They didn't know<br> what really moved her.<br> Look at this. Look at this.<br> Daddy gave me this...<br> And with Ginger happy, I was able<br> to concentrate on what I knew best.<br> Loose machines are<br> right back over there.<br> What are they doin' back there?<br> You can't even see 'em there.<br> - Okay, I'll...<br> - What about the progressives with the high jackpots?<br> - Well...<br> - These are our best machines. They bring all the action.<br> - No wonder the drop is off.<br> - Yeah, okay.<br> - The action is in the front. Bring 'em up front.<br> - All right, I will.<br> Listen to me very carefully. There are<br> three ways of doing things around here:<br> The right way, the wrong way<br> and the way that I do it.<br> - You understand?<br> - I do understand that. I'll get right on it.<br> - And thank you.<br> - Don't thank me. Just do it.<br> You're the slots manager.<br> I shouldn't have to tell you this.<br> Dang, you are right,<br> Mr. Rothstein. I am so sorry.<br> So I ended up working...<br> what, 18-hour days.<br> Ginger was the one who wound up<br> enjoying the best of Vegas.<br> Come with me, please.<br> I have a better table for you.<br> What did you say to that<br> fucking jerk, anyway?<br> I told him I was<br> Mrs. Sam Rothstein.<br> Well, you might<br> as well get something out of it.<br> Well, it wasn't long...<br> before what I was afraid<br> was gonna happen happened.<br> Nicky managed to get himself banned<br> from every casino in Las Vegas.<br> And from then on, I couldn't be seen<br> talking to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.<br> What the fuck is that<br> supposed to mean?<br> "He will be ejected from<br> any casino in Las Vegas.<br> And the casinos can be fined<br> as much as $100,000...<br> every time he shows up. "<br> - You believe this shit?<br> - Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.<br> "Because of notorious<br> and unsavory reputation... "<br> Motherfucker!<br> Is there any way<br> around this?<br> No, there's no way.<br> Let's say, for instance...<br> I wanna go in a restaurant,<br> which happens to be in the casino...<br> to get one of those<br> sandwiches I like?<br> Forget it. You can't even<br> set foot in the parking lot.<br> That's how serious it is.<br> In other words,<br> I'm fucked?<br> In so many words, yes.<br> It just didn't sink into his head<br> about the Black Book and what it meant.<br> Not being able to go<br> into a casino is one thing...<br> but being in this book etched your name<br> into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.<br> I mean, you're listed in there<br> with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.<br> I gotta do something.<br> They ain't gettin' rid of me.<br> They're not gettin' rid of me.<br> I'm stayin' here.<br> Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.<br> So, once they pulled that shit...<br> I started doin' my own things<br> nobody ever thought of doin'.<br> To keep an eye on things, I brought in my<br> kid brother, Dominick, and some desperados...<br> and started knockin' over<br> high-rollers, casino bosses...<br> bookmakers...<br> anybody right here in town.<br> I had a good fuckin' crew goin'<br> for me, I'll tell you that.<br> I had Sal Fusco,<br> a great second-story guy.<br> Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company<br> before he did a six-year bit.<br> And then there was Bernie Blue.<br> This guy can bypass any alarm for me.<br> It was like old times.<br> And I opened up my own jewelry<br> store too, the "Gold Rush. "<br> Sometimes I used to go along<br> on a heist, just for the fun of it.<br> But I didn't like the people<br> I was rippin' off looking at me...<br> so I used to turn<br> their fuckin' pictures around.<br> - What's takin' so long?<br> - This is a motherfucker!<br> - It's working.<br> - Learn how to open these things so you don't have to take 'em.<br> Some of these stones<br> got a lot of niggers in them.<br> Tell Pepe if he's switching stones on us,<br> he better take a camel back to Nigeria.<br> Yeah?<br> - They're in Penthouse K.<br> - Check in alone?<br> - They checked in alone.<br> - Are they out now?<br> - Yes. Don't worry.<br> - All right. Thanks.<br> He had tipsters<br> all over town. Bellmen.<br> - But you got to hurry.<br> - Yeah, okay.<br> - Valet parkers.<br> - They're just checking in now.<br> Okay, I'll tell him.<br> - Pit bosses.<br> - Room 1230 at the Scirocco.<br> - 1230. Right.<br> - Secretaries.<br> - Mint condition coins.<br> - Mint condition? All right.<br> And they all got<br> a piece of the score.<br> Car's coming.<br> They were very careful.<br> They always bypassed<br> the alarms, or else...<br> if not, they'd drill enough holes to knock<br> through the walls with a sledgehammer.<br> Nicky was grabbing<br> everything he could.<br> Nobody out there was expecting<br> a guy like him.<br> For Nicky, Las Vegas<br> was the fucking wild west.<br> I just got a shipment<br> of diamonds from Israel.<br> What the fuck they expect<br> from me? I had to earn, didn't I?<br> You know, this diamond<br> has flaws in it.<br> - There's no flaws.<br> - I'm doing this for 25 years.<br> You better clean your loupe,<br> because there's no flaws.<br> Whenever we got local merch...<br> we'd usually send it<br> to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.<br> I had a couple of sand niggers<br> out there. You know, Arabs.<br> What, are you gonna have<br> a fucking meeting here?<br> I know his language.<br> Forty thousand dollars.<br> The whole package.<br> Twenty thousand.<br> That's my final offer.<br> He suddenly talks English. Let's talk<br> Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.<br> I actually turned<br> my bedroom into a bank vault...<br> where I kept<br> the choice stuff.<br> I couldn't leave it<br> at the Gold Rush...<br> in case we got raided<br> by the cops...<br> or if my crew got cute.<br> I had the only key.<br> Jennifer didn't give a fuck.<br> She used to fall asleep<br> on the couch watching TV.<br> This stuff was all mine.<br> I didn't send any of this back home.<br> Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't<br> even supposed to be doin' it.<br> The bosses were making so much<br> fucking money with the casinos...<br> that they didn't want anybody<br> makin' any waves for them.<br> You gave all the guys<br> in your crew a piece of that?<br> - I took care of everybody.<br> - Yeah?<br> That's why there was no real organized<br> street stuff in Vegas before I came here.<br> But how much cash<br> could I bury in my closet?<br> You have to understand,<br> and I'm sure you do...<br> that in a venture<br> of this kind...<br> you have to be prepared<br> to take some kind of loss.<br> So I put some of the money into legitimate<br> deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.<br> You will try to push it through,<br> won't you, Mr. Clark?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm giving you 50,000 cash.<br> Then I put some more money into<br> legitimate places, like my restaurant.<br> - Is that the last one?<br> - Yeah.<br> I had my kid brother,<br> Dominick, run it for me.<br> Fuckers.<br> - Here you go, guys.<br> - All right.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.<br> Choke on it, motherfucker.<br> - Hey, Dom.<br> - How ya doin'?<br> Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.<br> He was a real restaurant buff.<br> And over the years,<br> he always made money with it.<br> In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.<br> It was a very popular spot.<br> He had politicians, showgirls and movie<br> stars hanging out all over the place.<br> That show over at the Flamingo<br> gets better and better.<br> By the way, Sammy said, whenever<br> you have a minute, give him a call.<br> - Made a messenger out of you too, huh?<br> - Anything for a buck.<br> - He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.<br> - Thanks.<br> But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky<br> liked most was the showgirls, naturally.<br> I mean, to them,<br> Nicky was the movie star.<br> - You walk past me?<br> - Hey, this is Shelly.<br> - Hey, Shelly. How are you?<br> - Hi.<br> - And this is Stacy.<br> - Stacy.<br> - This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?<br> - Pleasure.<br> Let's check the kitchen first.<br> Excuse us one second.<br> Come on. I'll show you.<br> I fly stuff in fresh every day.<br> I get bread from back home.<br> I get fish from California.<br> And you can always tell a great kitchen<br> like ours because of the milk-fed veal.<br> That's the secret.<br> See, milk-fed veal is pure white.<br> Out here they got that pink veal.<br> Slide over, honey.<br> Now, pink veal, you can pound<br> that shit for two days.<br> It'll never, ever get tender.<br> You know what I mean?<br> I left here with the money.<br> Got muscled on the street.<br> A couple guys, I owe them.<br> So I gave them the money.<br> - That's what I did.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You call yourself a man?<br> You know you're a lyin' lowlife,<br> motherfuckin' gamblin' degenerate prick?<br> You know that's what you are?<br> Two small kids at home.<br> I gave you money to pay<br> the fuckin' rent...<br> and buy groceries,<br> put the heat on.<br> Your wife called Frankie and<br> told him the fuckin' heat's off.<br> And you didn't gamble<br> that fuckin' money?<br> - No? You didn't?<br> - I didn't...<br> Don't fuck with me, Al!<br> Don't make a fuck outta me.<br> You wanna embarrass me and make<br> a fool outta me? You didn't gamble?<br> Tell me you gambled<br> the fuckin' money...<br> I'll give you the fuckin' money<br> to put the fuckin' heat on!<br> Did you gamble? Huh?<br> Fuckin' degenerate.<br> Fuckin' kids at home.<br> Here. Get the fuck outta here.<br> - Thanks, Nick.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> Let me find out you fucked up.<br> I'll leave you where I find you.<br> How many of these<br> you gonna eat?<br> - Two.<br> - Two?<br> But around 6:30 in the morning,<br> when he finished his day...<br> no matter where he was<br> or what he was doing...<br> he always went home to make breakfast<br> for his son, Nicky boy.<br> I know you like this.<br> A little butter, right?<br> - Not a lot. You know why, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Why?<br> - 'Cause it clogs up your heart.<br> What a smart kid you are.<br> Okay, eat.<br> Every couple of weeks,<br> I used to send Marino...<br> back to the bosses<br> with a piece of what I made.<br> Not a bit piece,<br> but what did they know?<br> They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't<br> know anybody who can see that far.<br> Their drop was<br> a truck stop garage...<br> where Remo and the guys used<br> to hang out and count their millions.<br> - Remo.<br> - Hey, Frankie.<br> The cops knew,<br> but they didn't give a fuck.<br> Nicky sends<br> his warmest regards.<br> I knew how<br> to keep the bosses happy.<br> Whenever they gave me<br> little jobs to do...<br> I would carry things out<br> to a "T."<br> Like the time Tony Dogs, who's supposed<br> to be the new maniac tough guy in town...<br> shot up one of Remo's bars.<br> Here's a fuckin' guy<br> kills two of Remo's guys...<br> and a poor fuckin' waitress who was just<br> workin' on her night off, of all things.<br> I mean, this guy's just beggin'<br> to be made an example of.<br> Frankie, I want the names<br> of all the other people he had with him.<br> And I don't care what you have<br> to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?<br> - I'll take care of it, Remo.<br> - And mow 'em down.<br> To be truthful with you,<br> I had to admire this guy.<br> He was one of the toughest<br> Irishmen I ever met.<br> This son of a bitch was tough.<br> For two days and two fuckin' nights<br> we beat the shit outta this guy.<br> We even stuck ice picks<br> in his balls.<br> - Better give me a name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - But he never talked.<br> - I know you would've ratted by now.<br> In the end, I had to put<br> his fuckin' head in a vise.<br> Dogs, Dogs,<br> can you hear me, Dogs?<br> Listen to me, Anthony.<br> I got your head in a vise.<br> I'll squash your fuckin' head like a<br> grapefruit if you don't give me a name.<br> Don't make me have to do this.<br> Please. Come on!<br> Don't make me be a bad guy.<br> Come on.<br> Fuck you!<br> This motherfucker. You believe this?<br> Two fuckin' days and nights.<br> Fuck me? Fuck me?<br> You motherfucker!<br> Fuck my mother?<br> Is that what you're tellin' me?<br> You motherfucker, you! Huh?<br> - Oh, God!<br> - Give me the fuckin' name!<br> Charlie M.<br> - Charlie M.?<br> - Charlie M.<br> You make me pop your<br> fuckin' eye outta your head...<br> to protect that piece of shit,<br> Charlie M.?<br> You dumb motherfucker!<br> Kill me, you fuck!<br> Kill me!<br> You motherfucker, you!<br> Frankie, do him<br> a fuckin' favor.<br> The word got around<br> that finally...<br> there was a real<br> gangster in town.<br> Nicky was the new boss<br> of Las Vegas.<br> Charlie M.<br> Four reels, sevens,<br> across three $15,000 jackpots.<br> Do you have any idea<br> what the odds are?<br> It's gotta be<br> in the millions, maybe more.<br> Three fuckin' jackpots in 20 minutes!<br> Why didn't you call me?<br> It happened so quick. Three guys won.<br> I didn't have a chance.<br> - You didn't see the scam?<br> - There's no way to determine that.<br> Yes, there is.<br> They won!<br> It's a casino.<br> People gotta win sometimes.<br> Ward, you're pissing me off.<br> Now you're insulting my intelligence.<br> You know goddamn well somebody had to get into<br> those machines and set those fuckin' reels.<br> The probability on one machine<br> is a million and a half to one.<br> On three machines in a row,<br> it's in the billions.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Didn't you see you were being set up<br> on the second win?<br> I think you're overreacting.<br> Listen, you fuckin' yokel. I've been<br> carrying your ass ever since I got here.<br> - Get your ass outta here.<br> - You're firing me?<br> I'm firing you.<br> No, I'm not firing...<br> - You might regret this.<br> - I'll regret it if I keep you.<br> This is not the way<br> to treat people.<br> If you didn't know,<br> you're too fuckin' dumb.<br> If you did know,<br> you were in on it.<br> Either way, you're out.<br> Get out. Come on. Let's go.<br> The guy's history<br> as far as I'm concerned.<br> But you can't fire him. His<br> brother-in-law is County Commissioner.<br> Everybody with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county<br> commissioner or related to a commissioner.<br> This is his state.<br> His uncle's chief judge.<br> His brother-in-law runs<br> the county commission.<br> You're in the finances,<br> you're upstairs.<br> But you are not on the floor.<br> You don't see what's going on.<br> I've got thousands of players.<br> I've got 500 dealers.<br> They're all looking<br> to rob me blind 24 hours a day.<br> I have to let them know I'm watching<br> all the details all the time.<br> There is not one single thing<br> I will not catch.<br> - Look at yours. Look at that.<br> - Huh?<br> Look at this.<br> There's nothing.<br> Look how many blueberries<br> your muffin has.<br> What are you talking about?<br> If you don't do it yourself,<br> it never gets done.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - # How long can this go on #<br> From now on, I want you to put an equal<br> amount of blueberries in each muffin.<br> An equal amount of blueberries<br> in each muffin.<br> Do you know how long<br> that's going to take?<br> I don't care how long it takes.<br> Put an equal amount in each muffin.<br> Just a little.<br> That a girl.<br> Oh, boy, look.<br> You wanna go to Mommy?<br> Wanna come to Mommy?<br> It's all right, sweetheart.<br> I need to talk to you.<br> I need some money.<br> - What do you need?<br> - Got her?<br> Well, I need a lot.<br> I need more than usual.<br> Why don't you take it<br> out of your account?<br> I would, you know, Sam,<br> it's just that...<br> Well, I need more than that.<br> I need $25,000.<br> Twenty-five thousand?<br> For yourself?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Why do you need that much?<br> What's the difference?<br> I just need it.<br> Well, I gotta ask you.<br> That's a lot of money.<br> You're not asking<br> for a box of popcorn.<br> We don't have to turn this<br> into a big deal.<br> Okay? We don't have<br> to have a fight.<br> It's important to me.<br> Just something I wanted to do.<br> Who's fighting?<br> I mean, tell me what it's for.<br> Why can't you tell me<br> what it's for? Huh?<br> Well, you know what?<br> Now I want you to tell me.<br> My wife comes to me and asks me<br> for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?<br> - No.<br> - If you want a coat, you got it.<br> It's not the money. It's just, why do you<br> want it? Am I not entitled to ask that?<br> Sam, I've been independent my whole life.<br> I never had to ask anybody for anything.<br> - Now you're making me beg.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> And you're embarrassing me.<br> Why do you want to make me feel so bad?<br> You're asking me for 25,000.<br> I'm not out to make you feel bad.<br> I want to just<br> be able to trust you.<br> You know,<br> it's about trust.<br> I have to be able<br> to trust you with my life.<br> Do you understand?<br> Can I trust you?<br> Can I trust you?<br> Can I trust you?<br> Answer me. Can I trust you?<br> You can trust me.<br> Good. So then you could tell me<br> what the money is for.<br> # You've got to #<br> # Give a little #<br> # Take a little #<br> # And let your poor heart #<br> # Break a little #<br> Yeah, she's leaving the bank now.<br> All right,<br> I'm gonna follow her.<br> What is that?<br> I know that look.<br> What does that look mean?<br> It means I got the money.<br> # You've got to #<br> - # Give a little #<br> - Yes, you're way up on top now.<br> # Take a little ##<br> How are you doin', Les?<br> It's Lester, right?<br> Sam.<br> From my recollection,<br> aren't you the card shark...<br> the golf hustler,<br> the pimp from Beverly Hills?<br> If I'm wrong,<br> please correct me.<br> 'Cause I never knew you<br> to be a heist man.<br> But if you are,<br> you know what?<br> Here, take mine too.<br> Go ahead. Take it.<br> 'Cause you already have hers.<br> She's my wife.<br> Look at me.<br> You did know that, didn't you?<br> You knew that she's my wife?<br> - Hey, look at me.<br> - Yeah, I know that.<br> You know, yeah?<br> But if you ever<br> come back again, ever...<br> to take her money,<br> next time bring a pistol.<br> That way<br> you got a chance.<br> Be a man.<br> Don't be a fucking pimp.<br> Now, you wanna do me a favor?<br> Get outta here.<br> I wanna be alone with my wife.<br> Get up and get outta here.<br> - And you want to be free.<br> - # Take a little #<br> Why, you feel<br> that you are too good...<br> much too good<br> for a nobody like me.<br> - Fuckin' piece of shit.<br> - That's fuckin' bullshit.<br> - # That's the story #<br> - Well, darling, I guess it's best...<br> - # That's the glory of love #<br> - that we should part.<br> Remember when you called him<br> that night and said good-bye?<br> He didn't say, "Don't get married.<br> I'll be right down. "<br> - He didn't say that to you, did he?<br> - No, he didn't.<br> No. Instead, what did he say?<br> "Fuck him. Take him<br> for everything he's got. "<br> Come here.<br> I want to show you something.<br> - # That's the story #<br> - The second letter came right after I gave you your start.<br> No! No! No!<br> No! Make 'em stop it!<br> No! No!<br> It's not his fault!<br> It's my fault!<br> No!<br> - Fuck! Fuck!<br> - Piece of shit.<br> Do it yourself,<br> you chickenshit cocksucker!<br> He's such a prick!<br> He had some guy<br> from the hotel beat him up.<br> He didn't want<br> to do it himself.<br> Oh, no, he didn't want<br> to get his own hands dirty.<br> So why did he<br> have to do that, huh?<br> Tell me.<br> - I know it wasn't a nice thing to do...<br> - No shit.<br> You gotta understand it. He doesn't know<br> if this guy is shaking you down...<br> No. No. I told him all about this guy<br> before we ever got married.<br> - This is no fucking surprise.<br> - Oh, you did? I didn't know that.<br> He's just a friend of mine<br> I was trying to help. So what?<br> You know, the first time<br> I ever saw you guys together...<br> I never saw him so happy.<br> I mean, I know he's<br> a crazy Jew fuck and everything...<br> but I never seen him act<br> like that with anybody else.<br> I think he's crazy about you.<br> I mean, he really loves you.<br> Come on. I went into this<br> with my eyes open, you know.<br> I knew the bottom<br> could drop out at any time.<br> You don't think I'm gonna<br> go into a situation like this...<br> if I don't think I'm gonna<br> get covered on the back end.<br> - Sure, I can see that.<br> - Right?<br> So I put aside some jewelry for me.<br> A lot of jewelry.<br> You mean like a lot<br> of expensive jewelry? About how much?<br> You want to steal it?<br> No. I'm just curious.<br> I was wondering...<br> how much he would put<br> into a thing like that.<br> I'm told it's worth<br> about a million dollars, maybe more.<br> Well, there you go.<br> What does that tell you?<br> A million dollars in jewelry.<br> Does that tell you<br> the guy is crazy about you?<br> I should've never married him.<br> He's a Gemini.<br> Triple Gemini. Duality.<br> Gemini is the snake, you know.<br> You can't trust a snake.<br> I mean it.<br> I know what you mean.<br> Listen, Ginger.<br> You know, this is probably not...<br> I don't have the answers anyway.<br> - This is probably not what you want to hear...<br> - I do.<br> 'Cause you're a little upset,<br> and I understand that.<br> But I think you should try to make the<br> best of it now. Go slow. See what happens.<br> He could've killed him! Okay? He could've<br> killed him. He didn't have to hit him.<br> It's not like<br> I'm sleeping with the guy.<br> He makes me sneak around to see<br> my own friends. What is that all about?<br> I guess it's 'cause he loves<br> you so much, he's jealous and worried.<br> He gives a fuck what I do.<br> Look, I'll try to find out<br> what the hell is going on.<br> - When I see him, I'll talk to him.<br> - Okay.<br> - All right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Thanks. Thanks<br> for putting up with me.<br> Take it easy with this shit.<br> This can only make matters worse.<br> You're a beautiful girl. I've seen a lot<br> of girls get shot to hell from this.<br> You're so nice.<br> Come on, now. I don't<br> wanna see you unhappy.<br> - # These eyes before us #<br> - Thanks.<br> # Just what the truth is #<br> - Thank you.<br> - It's all right.<br> # I can't say anymore #<br> # 'Cause I love you #<br> # Yes, I love you... ##<br> Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner<br> Pat Webb is here to see you.<br> - Give me a minute.<br> - Okay. Just a minute.<br> Mr. Webb, can I<br> get you anything?<br> Uh, no. No, thank you,<br> little lady.<br> Okay, send him in.<br> Then call me four minutes after.<br> - Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Hey, it is a pleasure.<br> - I heard a lot about you.<br> Oh, thank you, sir.<br> Hey, house is doin' well.<br> Hey, all that money<br> is rollin' in.<br> I appreciate you takin' the time<br> to see a poor civil servant.<br> - Why don't you have a seat, hmm?<br> - Oh, thank you, sir.<br> I come here personally<br> to kind of smooth over...<br> any fracas<br> about a certain matter.<br> See, uh, maybe<br> you didn't know it...<br> but Don Ward is a very<br> well-liked man in this town.<br> He's got lots of friends. Nice family<br> and their money go back many, many years.<br> Now friends vote.<br> Family and money votes.<br> That's important<br> to me and you.<br> And if you'll think about<br> our little problem along them lines...<br> and you'll forgive me<br> for sayin' it...<br> maybe he did not<br> deserve to be fired.<br> I'm sorry, but he knew<br> about our getting hit...<br> on three big machines in a row,<br> and he did nothing about it.<br> That means, either he was in on it or he<br> was too dumb to see what was goin' on.<br> Either way, I cannot have<br> a man like that working here.<br> Before we point the dirty<br> end of the stick at old Don...<br> we better be sure<br> we can prove them charges.<br> Believe me, if I could prove it,<br> he would be under arrest.<br> Are, uh...<br> Are we certain that you want<br> the Gaming Control Board...<br> eyeballing your record and<br> your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro.<br> I think you're way out of line<br> talking to me like that.<br> What you're saying is libelous, and you're<br> in no position to challenge my expertise.<br> I went way out of my way<br> to be very helpful to that kid.<br> He's weak. He's incompetent.<br> He jeopardizes the whole place.<br> There's not much more<br> I can do for him.<br> You have got me there.<br> Old Don is as useless<br> as tits on a boar.<br> But he is my brother-in-law...<br> and I would look on it<br> as a personal favor...<br> if you'd think some more<br> on hirin' him back.<br> I can't do that.<br> I appreciate the fact<br> that he's your brother-in-law...<br> and I do want to help you<br> and I like to do favors.<br> I know who you are,<br> but I cannot do that.<br> Well, could there be<br> any position...<br> farther down the trough?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I can't do anything.<br> He's too incompetent, and the bottom<br> line is, he cannot be trusted.<br> Okay. Thanks.<br> Well... you know,<br> that's it. I'm sorry.<br> Mr. Rothstein, your people<br> never will understand...<br> the way it works out here.<br> You're all just our guests.<br> But you act<br> like you're at home.<br> Let me tell you something, partner.<br> You ain't home.<br> But that's where we're gonna send you<br> if it harelips the governor.<br> - Thank you for your time.<br> - No problem.<br> - Sorry.<br> - You bet.<br> What happened to my pills?<br> Huh?<br> Isn't it bad enough you're drinking<br> too much? You're taking my pills too?<br> I didn't take your pills.<br> Look, for my ulcer,<br> I take a half a one of these.<br> And that's when I have<br> extreme pain.<br> I had a three-month supply.<br> What did you do with 'em?<br> You didn't have to beat him up.<br> What?<br> I was just trying to help him.<br> Like I'm sleeping with the guy.<br> Yeah, how do I know?<br> You can't make me stop<br> caring about people.<br> What? What?<br> I said,<br> you can't make me...<br> stop caring about people.<br> Listen... Ginger...<br> I'm trying to make the best<br> of everything here, you know?<br> I mean, you're my wife,<br> for Christ's sakes.<br> I mean, people look up<br> to you in this town.<br> You know what, Ace?<br> I don't give a shit!<br> I'm gettin' out of here.<br> I am.<br> Come over here.<br> You gotta get hold of yourself.<br> - Okay. Okay.<br> - If not for me, at least for Amy.<br> Understand? Your drinking's<br> gettin' way out of hand.<br> I'm gonna get you into a program.<br> They got plenty of good ones.<br> - I don't need one.<br> - Yes, you do. It's very discreet.<br> There's no names<br> in the papers.<br> That's all you care about.<br> You don't care about me.<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - No, you don't.<br> How could you say that?<br> You're a beautiful woman.<br> You're destroying yourself.<br> You don't need that fuckin'<br> leech living off you.<br> I know you better<br> than you know yourself.<br> You're a tiger.<br> You're stronger than I am.<br> When you set your mind on doing<br> something, you do it better than anybody.<br> You're gonna do it.<br> Okay? You'll do it.<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, God.<br> Okay.<br> I'll try. I'll try.<br> I'll try. I will.<br> Don't be mad at me, okay?<br> I will.<br> No matter what the problems<br> were outside the count room...<br> it was all worth it.<br> The cash kept rollin' in...<br> and the suitcases<br> kept comin' and goin'.<br> And let me tell you, the fuckin'<br> bottom line here is... cash.<br> The only problem was<br> that after a while...<br> the bosses noticed that the suitcases<br> were gettin' a little light.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You mean to tell me...<br> that the money we're robbing<br> is being robbed?<br> Somebody's robbing from us?<br> We go through all this trouble<br> and somebody's robbing us?<br> Huh?<br> Like I said, it's part of the business.<br> It's considered leakage.<br> Leakage my balls.<br> I want the guy who's robbing us.<br> Even John Nash...<br> that's the guy who ran the scam...<br> he knew there wasn't much<br> he could do about it.<br> You gotta know that<br> a guy who helps you steal...<br> even if you take care<br> of him real well...<br> he's gonna steal<br> a little extra for himself.<br> Makes sense, don't it?<br> Try and make these hardheaded<br> old greaseballs understand that.<br> What's the point of skimming if we're<br> being skimmed? It defeats the purpose.<br> Huh?<br> They take this money because they're<br> my guys, so give 'em some leeway.<br> But the bosses<br> never believed in leeway...<br> so listen to what they do.<br> They put Artie Piscano,<br> the underboss of K. C...<br> in charge of making sure<br> nobody skimmed the skim.<br> - What were you doin'?<br> - I was with my cumma.<br> - What are you doin' with your cumma?<br> - I gave her a scheff.<br> The only trouble was,<br> Piscano was a disaster.<br> This guy could fuck up<br> a cup of coffee.<br> - What you been doin'?<br> - I'm out there more than I'm here.<br> And little did anybody know<br> where this would lead.<br> If they did, they'd would've<br> been better off makin' fuckin' novena.<br> You gotta go back there<br> and talk to that guy.<br> - I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.<br> - What expenses?<br> I'm layin' money outta my own pocket,<br> and I never get anything back.<br> You gotta go back out there.<br> From now on, I'm gonna<br> start keepin' records.<br> No records, Artie. What are<br> you gonna do with records, pay taxes?<br> I keep layin' out<br> my own fuckin' dough.<br> What the hell are<br> we doin' over here?<br> You're goin' to Las Vegas<br> at my expense.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> I mean, after all...<br> No matter how many novenas<br> you could make...<br> nothing was gonna stop<br> what came up next.<br> - I can't believe you're doing this.<br> - We made a deal.<br> It turned out Phil Green,<br> Mr. Integrity...<br> had a partner<br> nobody knew about.<br> And when she showed up<br> and started demanding money...<br> - Why are you doing this?<br> - Because you're wrong.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> - No, I am not wrong.<br> Green tried to stonewall her.<br> I will see to it that you<br> do not get away with this.<br> So, she sued him in court.<br> The court will now hear the matter<br> of the plaintiff, Anna Scott...<br> against Tangiers Corporation<br> and its president, Phil Green.<br> - Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.<br> - Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.<br> - Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.<br> - Thank you, Judge.<br> I believe he was fair,<br> and I'm delighted with the decision.<br> We got a problem.<br> It didn't go too well.<br> Green has to open up the books...<br> has to show how<br> he got the financing.<br> Hey, that's not good.<br> She was doin' pretty good<br> with her lawsuit.<br> But before she could start<br> countin' her money...<br> the boys back home decided<br> to settle the case out of court.<br> So they sent me.<br> Can you comment on<br> the murder of Anna Scott?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - She was found last night shot in the head.<br> Was this just<br> a real estate partnership?<br> Her lawyer said<br> you were partners.<br> We were involved in minor<br> real estate deals many years ago.<br> It was never a partnership.<br> Did you ever hear<br> of the. 22 Caliber Killer?<br> Now, instead of the cops<br> only looking at Nicky...<br> they started looking<br> at Green too.<br> And he was supposed to be<br> our squeaky-clean front man.<br> I had to start giving interviews<br> to make sure everybody knew...<br> the casino<br> was on the up-and-up.<br> So how often do you<br> really fill in for him?<br> Green's here about<br> two or three times a month...<br> and he's busy<br> with real estate deals.<br> So in Green's absence,<br> then, you're the boss?<br> I serve at the pleasure<br> of the chairman of the board.<br> My responsibilities are<br> to run the day-to-day operations.<br> So day-to-day, then,<br> you're the boss?<br> Well, in a sense, you could say<br> that I am the boss...<br> when Mr. Green is away.<br> You could say that.<br> Hmm, have you read this?<br> About Mr. Rothstein.<br> It says, "The Midwest bookmaker<br> with mob ties...<br> says that he is the real boss<br> of the $100 million...<br> Tangiers casino empire. "<br> Did he really say that?<br> Why, of course he said that.<br> It's right here.<br> Has that man even filed<br> for his license yet?<br> I don't know.<br> We have to check the files.<br> Without gettin' your shorts<br> in a knot, would you do that?<br> And kinda check closely, 'cause we may<br> have to kick a kike's ass outta town.<br> Thank you.<br> A Gaming Control Board<br> investigation...<br> of Tangiers executive<br> Sam Rothstein's application...<br> for a gaming license<br> is underway.<br> Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers Casino<br> operation and is a boyhood friend...<br> of Las Vegas mob boss<br> Nicky Santoro...<br> could lose his ability<br> to work in the casino...<br> Hello?<br> - I gotta meet Clean Face. What about the Chez Paris?<br> - You can't.<br> - You gotta make a reservation. It's all booked up.<br> - No, no.<br> It's impossible.<br> You gotta make a reservation.<br> It's very difficult<br> to get in.<br> I'll use the service entrance.<br> I'll see you at 9:00.<br> All right.<br> The battle between State gaming<br> officials and Tangiers Casino boss...<br> Sam "Ace" Rothstein<br> is heating up.<br> Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look at Ace<br> Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing...<br> despite law enforcement allegations of<br> Rothstein's organized crime connections.<br> Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged<br> organized crime figure Nicky Santoro...<br> keep Rothstein from running<br> the Tangiers Casino?<br> And can the integrity of state gaming laws<br> be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?<br> - Why don't you take it easy<br> on that stuff? Huh?<br> Come on.<br> Let me help you down.<br> We're talking<br> about some stuff.<br> At 6:00: Will a boyhood friendship unseat<br> Rothstein as the Tangiers Casino boss?<br> Exclusive on the KBBO<br> special news report.<br> Go down. Just... go downst-<br> You can't let this concern you, Ace.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's just a political<br> witch hunt.<br> Ace.<br> Do you want<br> something to drink?<br> - Charlie, a refill?<br> - Yeah, great.<br> No. Hey, Mr. Clark.<br> I've been tryin' to reach you.<br> - You're tougher to get than the president.<br> - Well, I've been busy.<br> Yeah? At least you could return<br> my phone calls, though.<br> Listen, Nicky,<br> we talked about this.<br> And I explained to you that you might<br> have to take some kind of loss.<br> Yeah.<br> I think I want my money back.<br> What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?<br> - You know, I think you've gotten<br> the wrong impression about me.<br> I think, in all fairness...<br> I should explain to you<br> exactly what it is that I do.<br> Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice<br> and early, take a walk to the bank...<br> and walk in and see, and, uh,<br> if you don't have my money for me...<br> I'll crack your fuckin' head<br> wide open in front of everybody.<br> And just about the time<br> that I'm comin' out of jail...<br> hopefully you'll be comin'<br> out of your coma.<br> And guess what? I'll split<br> your fuckin' head open again.<br> 'Cause I'm fuckin' stupid.<br> I don't give a fuck about jail.<br> That's my business.<br> That's what I do.<br> We know what you do.

You fuckin' try me.<br> You think he got the point?<br> What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for<br> chrissakes. He's gonna run to the F.B.I.<br> That prick's been dodgin' me for three<br> weeks. You're tryin' to tell me what to do.<br> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do.<br> You're outta line. Where's your head?<br> Where's my head?<br> Where's your fuckin' balls?<br> I'm tryin' to put somethin' big together<br> here. You know what I'm talkin' about.<br> If you're actin' like this now,<br> can I depend on you?<br> A lot of things gonna change. If you wanna be<br> there with me, you're gonna have to go my way.<br> Listen, Nick, understand my situation.<br> I'm responsible for thousands of people.<br> I got a hundred million a year<br> goin' through the place.<br> It's all over if I don't<br> get that license.<br> If it goes bad for me,<br> it's bad for a lot of people.<br> Forget about your fuckin' license. I plant<br> my own flag, you ain't gonna need a license.<br> You know, I don't know what it is,<br> Sammy, but the more I talk to you...<br> the more I feel like you just<br> don't want to go along with me.<br> - No, I don't want to come along with you.<br> - All right, fine.<br> I don't want to be involved<br> in anything you're talking about, okay?<br> I want to run a square joint.<br> I just want my license.<br> I want everything quiet.<br> That's it!<br> Quiet like this?<br> "I'm the boss"? That's quiet?<br> That's taken out of context.<br> I had no control over that.<br> - Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.<br> - Back home that looks bad.<br> Looks bad? Every time you're on<br> television, I get mentioned. That looks bad.<br> - What the fuck happened to you?<br> - What happened to me?<br> - What happened to you? You lost control.<br> - I lost control?<br> Look at you, you're fuckin' walkin'<br> around like John Barrymore.<br> A pink robe and a fuckin'<br> cigarette holder? I lost control?<br> I don't wanna bring this up, but you been<br> treatin' people with disrespect, even your wife.<br> My wife? What does she have<br> to do with this?<br> She was upset about a lot of things, especially<br> that whole fuckin' Lester Diamond incident.<br> You're the shoulder to cry on? Did you her<br> tell about your little role in that situation?<br> No, that's not<br> the fuckin' point.<br> - The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.<br> - I would appreciate it...<br> if you stay out<br> of my personal life.<br> - You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.<br> - She came to talk to me.<br> What was I supposed to do?<br> Throw her out?<br> - Stay away from her. It's none of your business.<br> - It's none of my business?<br> A week ago it was. Now it's none of my<br> business. When you need me, you need me.<br> The way you need me<br> to vouch for you as a citizen.<br> I'm gonna have to straighten out<br> what you did with this guy.<br> This guy is gonna run<br> to the F.B.I. Now.<br> Your head's bigger<br> than your casino.<br> I knew what<br> he wanted. Nicky wanted to take over.<br> He wanted to go after Gaggi,<br> the skim, everything and everybody.<br> Plus, he had stopped asking permission<br> from back home for every little thing.<br> A casino boss and his wife were killed.<br> The bulls questioned Nicky.<br> A dealer from the Sirocco.<br> They questioned Nicky.<br> A bunch of stool pigeons wound up in the<br> trunks of their cars. They questioned Nicky.<br> A lawyer.<br> They questioned Nicky.<br> When some guys that didn't pay<br> their shylocks began disappearing...<br> Nicky's name was in every one<br> of those newspapers.<br> Nicky was questioned in two dozen<br> murders, but they always had to let him go.<br> There were never any witnesses.<br> The coppers blamed me<br> for everything that went wrong.<br> Watch yourself.<br> You're gonna get runned over, there.<br> If a guy fuckin' tripped over a<br> banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.<br> Come on, be nice, huh?<br> And the bosses were no better. They<br> complained because things don't run smooth.<br> In my line of work,<br> things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.<br> I'm dealin' with degenerate<br> animals out here.<br> But the bosses,<br> what do they give a fuck?<br> They're sittin' on their asses<br> drinkin' anisette.<br> I'm the guy in the trenches.<br> Fuckin' bosses think it's<br> a fuckin' free lunch out here.<br> Frankie, they found<br> a guy's head in the desert.<br> You know about that?<br> - Yeah, I heard. Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> Everybody's talkin'. They're makin' a big<br> deal out of it. It's in all the papers.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> And I mean, that's no good. You gotta tell<br> him to take care of things a little better.<br> I'll tell him, Remo.<br> Fuckin' bosses;<br> they're smokin' their Di Nobilis...<br> and they're eatin' trippa and fuckin'<br> suffritte, you know, fried pigs' guts.<br> If I want to talk private,<br> I gotta go to a bus stop.<br> - What do they care long as I keep sendin' money back?<br> - They're complainin'.<br> Let 'em complain. I'm the one<br> who's here. I do all the work.<br> - Somebody don't like it, fuck 'em.<br> - It's up to you.<br> They want a fuckin' war?<br> I'm ready.<br> All I gotta do is take care of five of<br> those guys. The rest will fall into place.<br> Peekaboo, you fucks, you.<br> I see you,<br> you motherfuckers.<br> Nicky was not only bringing<br> heat on himself but on me too.<br> The F.B.I. Watched every move he made,<br> but he didn't care. He just didn't care.<br> If they're gonna watch me,<br> I'm gonna watch 'em right back.<br> I spent a few bucks.<br> Top dollar. Who gives a shit?<br> I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment from<br> the same places that sell to the fuckin' C.I.A.<br> I had special police frequency radios, F.B.I.<br> De-scramblers, cameras that see in the dark.<br> And because of that, the miserable sons<br> of bitches never caught me doin' anything.<br> I got my job on the line, and<br> this guy's havin' the time of his life.<br> He has every cop in the state<br> watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.<br> And at the worst<br> possible time for me.<br> I had my license hearing coming up, and<br> I didn't want to leave anything to chance.<br> I mean, if I can't work in Vegas,<br> where am I gonna go?<br> You've been very open with us.<br> I mean, your books and papers.<br> That's gonna mean something<br> when you go before the commission.<br> - All I ask is a fair hearing.<br> - This kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing.<br> All right, well, we'll move on to...<br> - I wanted to hear<br> something about Kansas City.<br> What the fuck is this?<br> Where's this guy<br> gonna land, the fairway?<br> They're fuckin' agents, Frankie.<br> Look at this.<br> The Feds were watching Nicky<br> play golf for so long...<br> they ran out of gas.<br> Just what I needed, right<br> in front of the Control Board.<br> A hundred dollars,<br> whoever hits the plane.<br> And as if things weren't bad enough, in<br> comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.<br> He ran that little grocery store in Kansas<br> City where they bought the suitcases.<br> Fightin' over those suitcases again.<br> You know what that means, right?<br> I gotta take another trip to Vegas, and<br> it's gonna cost me another couple grand.<br> He ran it with his brother-in-law...<br> but mostly what he did was complain<br> about his trips to Vegas.<br> You gotta lay down the law, otherwise<br> they're gonna make a fool out of you.<br> I write it all down. Every fuckin'<br> nickel goes down. Receipts...<br> - Hey, oh, wha... What's the matter with you?<br> - Everything's here.<br> - Since when do you talk like that?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Nance gives me trouble, I'll tell him I'll<br> take the eyes out of his frickin' head.<br> - Again.<br> - I said, "frickin' head. "<br> - That's enough.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> What happens next?<br> You can't believe it.<br> Who would believe that the F.B.I.<br> Had a wire in the place...<br> lookin' for some information<br> about some old homicide...<br> about some guy who was whacked-out<br> God knows when over God knows what.<br> What's to prevent him with the suitcases<br> that he could take what he wants?<br> Fuckin' Nance takes back two suitcases<br> from the Tangiers. What about three or four?<br> We've got nobody<br> in the room to watch. That's the law.<br> We can't even go into the count room to<br> watch our money. You believe this bullshit?<br> Sure, he's got his people in there. They<br> could all be in on it together, those fucks.<br> I'll find out. If it's Green,<br> I'll bury that bastard.<br> I never trusted him.<br> They trust that scumbag. I don't.<br> - I'll hit the two of them with a fuckin' shovel.<br> - Take it easy.<br> Ma, I'm sorry.<br> They're beatin' me left and right.<br> - Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.<br> - I know, but that's enough.<br> You know what they're doin'. I can't<br> take this no more. Back and forth.<br> - Take it easy. You'll get a heart attack like that.<br> - I know. I'm too upset.<br> And the damn thing is,<br> they hear all this stuff...<br> about Las Vegas<br> and the casinos and suitcases...<br> and that's it.<br> Everything's comin' outta my pocket.<br> I gotta pay.<br> Would you believe that<br> such a thing could happen?<br> I'm in this to make money,<br> not to lose money.<br> Every F.B.I. Man across the country<br> had their ears open now.<br> If you want something done right<br> you gotta do it yourself.<br> I mean, Piscano, this guy<br> basically sunk the whole world.<br> There are some that are good<br> and some that are bad.<br> Mr. Chairman,<br> members of the commission...<br> Mr. Rothstein is pleased<br> to be here today.<br> When the day finally came, I was ready.<br> I felt so confident that<br> all I had to do was present my case.<br> We have documents, one of which is<br> a report by retired F.B.I. Agents...<br> which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein<br> from any wrongdoing.<br> - Counselor, before you continue...<br> - I want to have this marked...<br> This commission is prepared to act on a<br> motion denying the Rothstein application.<br> - Denying?<br> - Do I hear a motion seconded?<br> Mr. Chairman,<br> I second the motion.<br> Do I have a vote<br> on the motion?<br> - Aye.<br> - Aye. Aye.<br> The ayes have it.<br> This hearing is adjourned.<br> - You have to be kidding.<br> - Adjourned? What do you mean, "Adjourned"?<br> Senator, you promised me a hearing. You<br> didn't even look at the F.B.I. Reports.<br> When you were my guest at the Tangiers<br> Hotel, did you not promise me a fair hearing?<br> - I was never your guest.<br> - You were never my guest? I never comped you?<br> - I don't comp you at least three times a month?<br> - I'd like to answer that.<br> Mr. Rothstein is being very typical<br> to this point. He's lying.<br> The only time I was at the Tangiers<br> was with Barney Greenstein.<br> - Was I at that dinner? Tell me, was I at that dinner?<br> - You were wandering.<br> - Was I at that dinner? Was I?<br> - You were wandering.<br> - You were... in the... You were in the building.<br> - I was in the building?<br> You know I was at that dinner, and you swore<br> to me I would have a fair hearing. Did you not?<br> Did you not? Well, tell me I was at<br> least at the dinner. Allow me that much.<br> - Give me that much at least!<br> - Yes, you were.<br> Thanks for not calling me a liar,<br> you son of a bitch. You son of a...<br> A routine licensing hearing<br> turned into bedlam yesterday...<br> when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino<br> executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...<br> - What are you runnin' for, Bob?<br> - Accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.<br> You promised me when you were<br> getting comped at my hotel.<br> You were asking me for copies of your bill<br> so you could put 'em on your expense account.<br> In a wild outburst that followed<br> his gaming license denial...<br> - Bullshit! Bullshit!<br> - Rothstein followed several...<br> stunned commissioners into the hallway<br> where he continued his harangue...<br> until his own lawyers<br> and friends urged him to leave.<br> You have a past. I have a past.<br> My past is no worse than yours.<br> But you guys think you have<br> the right to pass judgment!<br> Long suspected of running<br> the Tangiers without a license...<br> yesterday's hearing was to determine<br> whether someone with Rothstein's history...<br> was qualified to officially hold<br> a top gaming post.<br> Fuckin' hypocrites!<br> - What the hell's he gonna do now?<br> - I don't know.<br> What's he doin'? He knows all those<br> guys he yelled at are friends of ours.<br> What's the matter with him,<br> making all this mess?<br> Maybe he could run things with another<br> job title. What are we gonna do?<br> However he runs things, it's gotta be<br> quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.<br> Say he's a janitor.<br> I don't give a shit.<br> But, please, whatever job he takes,<br> make sure it's something quiet.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> the Tangiers Hotel<br> proudly presents the all-new...<br> Sam Rothstein show,<br> Aces High.<br> Tonight, taped live<br> from the all-new Sports Book...<br> we present the premiere showing<br> of Aces High...<br> with the Sasha Semenoff<br> Orchestra...<br> and the Sam Rothstein Dancers!<br> Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and<br> the best football handicapper in America;<br> a man who will take you inside the real<br> Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen, the new entertainment<br> director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...<br> Mr. Sam Rothstein.<br> Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show. We're<br> very happy to have you here this evening.<br> The young lady to my left<br> is Trudy, who is...<br> a lead new dancer<br> in our fabulous show from Paris.<br> Our first guest this evening...<br> is Frankie Avalon.<br> - Keep an eye on him.<br> - I've got a large family.<br> - How many kids do you have?<br> - I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.<br> No, no, please. Please.<br> - That's amazing.<br> - There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.<br> - Ace, don't do it.<br> Oh, no, no. Oh, no.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> He's juggling!<br> Let's not take Commissioner<br> Pat Webb too seriously.<br> I recently challenged him to a debate<br> on this program, and he declined.<br> What are you worried about, Pat?<br> You don't have to send me any questions.<br> You can ask me<br> anything you want.<br> What the hell is he doin'<br> on television, anyway?<br> He's on all night, screamin' about how he's<br> gonna take his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.<br> He really must be crazy.<br> He's gonna go to Washington with this?<br> He's out<br> of his fuckin' mind.<br> It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.<br> Some people do what they want.<br> Other people have to pay<br> through the nose. Such is life.<br> Andy, go see him. Tell him<br> maybe it's time he should quit.<br> First of all, what they did<br> was totally unconstitutional.<br> We're on the list to be heard before<br> the Supreme Court of the United States.<br> These guys don't give a fuck about the<br> Supreme Court. They want you to walk away.<br> Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How<br> can I walk away? Don't you see what's at stake?<br> The old man said maybe<br> your friend should give in.<br> When the old man says "maybe,"<br> that's like a papal bull.<br> Not only should you quit,<br> you should run.<br> Every time they mention my name<br> in the papers, they mention Nicky too.<br> How the fuck<br> does that help?<br> The heat he brought down<br> is murder.<br> The police department was cooperative. He<br> pissed 'em off. Nobody can make a move anymore.<br> - What are you proposing?<br> - I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.<br> Maybe he should get lost<br> for awhile. Would that be so bad?<br> - They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.<br> - If he took a break...<br> it would give everybody<br> time to maneuver.<br> I would forget about the maneuver.<br> I would just get out.<br> I can't do that.<br> As soon as Andy got home,<br> Nicky heard about our talk.<br> Next morning, bright and early,<br> I get the call.<br> Great. You know, I've got to do<br> some shopping. You want to go?<br> Getting a call<br> from Nicky wasn't easy.<br> Even the codes didn't work.<br> So we figured out another act.<br> If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only<br> listen in on the stuff involving crimes.<br> So on routine calls, they have<br> to click off after a few minutes.<br> Yeah, I got<br> a sprained fuckin' elbow.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Meet me at 3:00.<br> - At Caesar's?<br> - 100 yards down the road.<br> - Why?<br> - Don't ask questions. Just be there.<br> Suzy Cream Cheese has<br> the exact same outfit.<br> I saw something.<br> Something very cute.<br> Okay, he's out.<br> It's the ant. Brown unit.<br> And he's with the bogey.<br> I think it's Frankie.<br> Nicky started out before me...<br> because it wasn't that easy<br> for him to get around.<br> Nicky couldn't even go<br> for a ride without changing cars...<br> at least six times<br> before he could shake all his tails.<br> Because of the planes,<br> he had to use underground garages.<br> Meeting in the middle<br> of the desert always made me nervous.<br> It's a scary place.<br> I knew about the holes<br> in the desert, of course.<br> And everywhere I looked,<br> there could have been a hole.<br> Normally, my prospects<br> of comin' back alive...<br> from a meetin' with Nicky<br> were 99 out of 100.<br> But this time, when I heard him say a<br> couple of hundred yards down the road...<br> I gave myself 50-50.<br> Where the fuck you get off talkin' to<br> people behind my back, goin' over my head?<br> - What people?<br> - What people? What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?<br> I don't even know<br> what you're talkin' about.<br> You said I'm bringin' heat on you? I gotta<br> listen to people because of your shit?<br> You're orderin' me out? You better get<br> your own fuckin' army, pal!<br> I didn't order you or anybody. I told Andy<br> Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.<br> - You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?<br> - Yeah.<br> Let the bullshit blow over<br> so I can run the casino.<br> Anything goes wrong with the casino,<br> it's my ass. It's not yours. It's my ass.<br> I don't know whether you know you have your<br> fuckin' casino because I made that possible!<br> I'm what counts out here. Not your fuckin'<br> country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows!<br> And what the fuck<br> are you doin' on TV anyhow?<br> I get calls from home every day.<br> They think you went batshit!<br> I'm only on TV because I gotta be able<br> to hang around the casino. You understand.<br> You could have had the food-and-beverage<br> job without goin' on television!<br> You wanted to go on TV.<br> Yeah, I wanted to go on TV. That<br> way I have a forum. I can fight back.<br> They know they can't fuck around with me like<br> they could if I was an unknown. That's right.<br> You're makin'<br> a spectacle of yourself.<br> Me? I wouldn't even be<br> in this situation if it wasn't for you.<br> Every time I meet somebody,<br> the question is: Do I know you?<br> - Sure, now you wanna blame your fuckin' license on me.<br> - No, Nicky.<br> When you asked me<br> if you could come out here...<br> what did I tell you?<br> Do you remember?<br> - Back up a fuckin' minute here.<br> - Do you remember what I told you?<br> I asked you? When the fuck did<br> I ever ask you if I could come out here?<br> Get this through your head,<br> you Jew motherfucker, you!<br> You only exist out here because of me!<br> That's the only reason!<br> Without me,<br> you personally...<br> Every fuckin' wise guy still around will<br> take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass!<br> Then where you gonna go?<br> You're fuckin' warned.<br> Don't go over my head again,<br> you motherfucker, you!<br> # Crack that whip #<br> - # Give the past the slip #<br> - Well, we got company.<br> # Step on a crack #<br> # Break your mama's back #<br> # When a problem comes along<br> you must whip it #<br> # Before the preacher<br> talks too long #<br> - # You must whip it #<br> - Did you see that?<br> Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together,<br> and he's actin' like he don't know me.<br> I know we're supposed to avoid each<br> other, but there's ways to do things.<br> Fuck him.<br> To Abraham Lincoln.<br> - Don't let it bother you.<br> - Does it look like it's botherin' me?<br> Why do I give a fuck?<br> That prick. He won't even look over.<br> What's his fuckin' problem?<br> - Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?<br> - They're havin' a good time.<br> - So are we.<br> - # Whip it good ##<br> Yeah?<br> - Sam, we got a problem.<br> - What is it?<br> The little guy. Nobody told him<br> he was eighty-sixed from the joint.<br> We turned our heads and made out<br> we didn't know who he was.<br> He's over at the 21 table<br> with his nose wide open.<br> He took money out of his own kick.<br> His nose is open for about 10,000.<br> - Now he's really pissed.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - He wants a 50,000 marker.<br> - Just give him ten.<br> That's it.<br> I'll be right down.<br> - He's gonna come up with 10,000, the way you want it.<br> - No, 50,000. I said 50!<br> Go get it. I don't give a fuck where you get<br> it. Fuckers. They take but don't give back.<br> # I ain't got a home<br> I got a phone ##<br> How the fuck can you grin?<br> How the fuck can you grin?<br> You know how much I'm stuck?<br> You give a fuck? Do you?<br> Give yourself a hand,<br> right across your fuckin' mouth.<br> Look at this beaut<br> they put in now.<br> Sherbert send you<br> to rob me now?<br> Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick<br> all night? Been beating the customers?<br> Huh, jag-off? Hit me.<br> Take this stiff and pound it<br> up your fuckin' ass.<br> Hit me again.<br> Take this one and stick it<br> up your sister's ass. Hit me again.<br> That's it. Keep lookin' at him. If you had any<br> heart at all, you'd be stealin' for a livin'.<br> Hit me again! What the fuck<br> you keep lookin' at him for?<br> You fuckin'... Look at this, 20 fuckin'<br> paints in a row. Hit me again.<br> You should pay as fast<br> as you collect, you know.<br> - You gotta get outta here.<br> - Tell this Jew motherfucker to pay that marker off.<br> I'm here to help you.<br> You're gonna bury us both.<br> - Just give me the money. Give me the fuckin' money.<br> - I'm gonna okay you ten.<br> Then you gotta get out<br> before the cops are all over you.<br> Ten and that's it.<br> What are you starin' at,<br> you bald-headed Jew prick?<br> - Come on, come on. Let's get outta here.<br> - Sue me, you Jew fuck!<br> Get outta here?<br> I got a marker comin'. Deal.<br> Everything's changed now.<br> You're talking about a divorce.<br> You're asking for alimony payments<br> and child support, and now custody.<br> I just want what any<br> divorced woman would get.<br> She's only sober<br> about two hours a day.<br> It's usually from 11:00 in the morning<br> 'til 1:00 in the afternoon.<br> If I gave her her money and her jewels,<br> she's gonna piss it all away in a year.<br> Where would you be then?<br> Comin' right back to me...<br> - or findin' some other excuse to come...<br> - We had a deal.<br> Remember that?<br> He said if it didn't work out between us,<br> I could get my things, and I could leave.<br> Look in my eyes.<br> Look-Look in my eyes.<br> You know me.<br> Do you see anything that makes<br> you think I would ever let...<br> someone in your condition<br> take my child away from me?<br> Do you?<br> You know that won't happen.<br> And after all this time...<br> and as hard as I tried,<br> as much as I wanted...<br> I could never reach her.<br> I could never make<br> her love me.<br> I always felt she should have gone<br> for all that money...<br> being somebody<br> for the first time in her life...<br> a home, a kid.<br> That's not what happened.<br> It didn't work out that way.<br> - Everything all right?<br> I mean, what could we do?<br> After a while, we'd just take breathers<br> from each other. Little separations.<br> At that time, I remember Ginger<br> took Amy to Beverly Hills.<br> She was gonna spend<br> a week shopping.<br> - Yes, Mr. Rothstein.<br> - Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please.<br> - Beverly Hotel.<br> - Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.<br> Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein<br> have checked out already.<br> Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein?<br> Hey, little Dale Evans.<br> - Yes, they both checked out.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hello. Yeah.<br> My wife is with an old friend<br> of hers in L.A.<br> Some lowlife.<br> A guy named Lester Diamond.<br> My daughter is with them, and I think<br> they're gonna try and kidnap her.<br> - Is there anybody you can send?<br> - We'll take care of it.<br> We got a number and an address.<br> - Hello. Is this Lester?<br> - Hello.<br> Who's calling?<br> This is Sam Rothstein. I want to talk<br> to Ginger. Put her on the phone.<br> She's not here, Sam.<br> Listen to me very carefully.<br> I want to talk to Ginger.<br> I want my kid back.<br> I want her put on a plane immediately.<br> - I know she's there. Don't fuck around.<br> - Sam, I wouldn't.<br> You shouldn't do this.<br> - You understand?<br> Put her on the fuckin' phone.<br> Sam, I don't know where she is.<br> So... listen...<br> Can I call you back?<br> - 702-472-1862.<br> - Mm-hmm. 1862.<br> - Okay, I'll call you right back.<br> - Right away.<br> - Right back.<br> - You got it.<br> Schmuck. All right,<br> I just bought us a few minutes.<br> You want to get back<br> at this prick? Hmm?<br> - Okay, you got what?<br> Two million in that box?<br> Hey, you got a minute? He's got<br> two million in the box, am I right?<br> You let him<br> keep your jewels.<br> We take the cash and the only other<br> thing he cares about. Huh? Her majesty.<br> We go to Europe.<br> You dye your hair.<br> I don't want to go to Europe.<br> I want to go to see "The Elephant Man. "<br> We're going to Europe.<br> Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.<br> You get plastic surgery<br> like we talked about.<br> You're the mother. How much you think<br> he'll pay to get this kid back?<br> - I don't want to go to Europe.<br> - Shut your mouth. You know where she gets this?<br> - You shut up.<br> You want me to come over there?<br> I'll smack your face.<br> Don't give me your shit!<br> This has always been a dream,<br> but now we're going.<br> - Lester, he called you here. He called you right here.<br> - That's who was on the phone.<br> - I just talked to him.<br> - So he knows where you are.<br> That means he's sending some guys<br> over here, probably right now.<br> It means he's sitting<br> by the phone, like a dumbbell...<br> - waiting for me to call him back.<br> - He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.<br> What do you think we're gonna do? He's<br> probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!<br> - This is fuckin' bullshit! This is bullshit!<br> - Get your bag! Let's go!<br> - Oh, what bullshit? What? You want to talk it over now?<br> - Okay, you done yakkin'?<br> - Go, go! Get in the car!<br> - Go, go, go.<br> Just relax.<br> Nobody's killing anybody.<br> I think he's gonna kill me.<br> - Just relax.<br> Call me back here in exactly an hour<br> on this phone. I'll see what I can do.<br> I'm gonna call you back<br> in an hour at this number...<br> - and you're gonna be there, right?<br> - I'll be here.<br> Listen, don't do anything else crazy,<br> okay? You all right? Okay.<br> Bye.<br> - Just knock it off. You two knock it off.<br> - She started it.<br> - She started the whole thing. I'm just standing here.<br> - Get in the car.<br> You're not gonna drive. Don't even think<br> you're gonna drive. I'm gonna drive.<br> - I'm not gonna drive with some crazy woman.<br> - You're driving me nuts!<br> Get on the passenger side! And I'm<br> sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!<br> Can we...<br> # You can go your own way #<br> # Go your own way #<br> # Tell me why #<br> - # Everything turned around #<br> - Ginger called me.<br> Yeah.<br> - I just told you she called me.<br> - What'd she want?<br> She was afraid to call you.<br> - She's with that cocksucker. They got Amy.<br> - That's why I'm here.<br> She wants to come back, but she's<br> afraid you're gonna whack her out.<br> - They're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?<br> - I know.<br> Why didn't you come to me? I mean,<br> this is family. It ain't business.<br> You make calls back home. It makes us<br> look bad out here. You know what I mean?<br> Back and forth,<br> this one and that one.<br> In the meantime,<br> she's gone anyway.<br> Am I right?<br> What am I going to do<br> with this woman?<br> - Driving me fuckin' crazy.<br> - I think if you, uh...<br> assure her that she's gonna be<br> all right, she'll come back.<br> Driving me fuckin' crazy.<br> Once you get her here,<br> you think about it.<br> Wait 'til you get the kid back.<br> She wants to come back.<br> That's the main thing here.<br> You want your kid, don't you?<br> Huh?<br> Hello.<br> Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted<br> to talk to, right?<br> Listen, I'm not gonna<br> ask you where you are.<br> Just, please, put Amy on a plane,<br> any plane, to get her here right away.<br> - That's all I'm asking.<br> - Do you...<br> I mean, I don't think<br> she should go by herself.<br> What do you mean?<br> What I mean is...<br> Do you think if I came back...<br> Do you think<br> you could forgive me?<br> I gotta tell you, I don't know.<br> I understand that.<br> I know I fucked up.<br> - What about the money? Where's the box?<br> - I gotta tell ya...<br> I made some mistakes,<br> and I spent some money.<br> - What's it under?<br> - Pretty serious.<br> - How serious?<br> - It's under 25.<br> - It's under 25,000?<br> - Yeah.<br> - The rest of the two million is still there?<br> - Yeah, I got the rest.<br> Okay, no big deal.<br> That's okay.<br> He got his 25.<br> That I'll live with.<br> Any more, I couldn't.<br> Okay.<br> All right, all right. Where are you?<br> I'll send a plane for you right away.<br> Hi, Sam.<br> So what'd you do with it?<br> With what?<br> With the money.<br> He needed some clothes.<br> He wanted a watch too.<br> - 25,000 for clothes and a watch?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> - Good evening, signora. This way.<br> - Geno.<br> The good part was I had Amy back.<br> So we went home, had the housekeeper<br> stay over, put the kid to bed.<br> I calmed myself down,<br> and we went to dinner.<br> I tried to keep things<br> nice and civil...<br> but, hey,<br> That doesn't<br> make much sense.<br> First of all, he's not gonna wear<br> thousand-dollar suits.<br> Let's say he did,<br> which he won't.<br> How you gonna get fitted<br> for 25 suits in three days?<br> - # I'm confessin' #<br> - I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?<br> I can't get fitted that fast,<br> and I pay twice as much.<br> - I bought him a watch too.<br> - Yeah.<br> But even if you bought him a really nice<br> watch, one that he thought was nice...<br> He doesn't know<br> what the fuck a good watch is.<br> - Say you go five, ten, twelve grand...<br> - Yeah.<br> At the most,<br> which is impossible, for him.<br> Plus, at the most, three suits,<br> - Around 10,000?<br> - Would you knock it off, Sam?<br> - I'm just trying to figure it out.<br> - There's nothing to figure out.<br> I'm home.<br> We're working it out.<br> I've been told before,<br> "We're working it out. "<br> You think<br> that you're home...<br> after what you just put me<br> through with Amy, is a favor to me?<br> So, counting the watch,<br> let's say another 4,000...<br> for expenses over the weekend...<br> of which you must have<br> had a good time.<br> I know he did.<br> That's for sure.<br> I know that fuckin' piece<br> of shit had a good fuckin' time.<br> On my money.<br> You might as well have fucked him,<br> which you probably did anyway.<br> You're lookin' at me<br> a certain way.<br> You're teary-eyed, huh?<br> You're upset. You're<br> a good actress, you know that?<br> Good fuckin' actress.<br> You can fuckin' get<br> that pity out of people.<br> I'm not a john.<br> You understand?<br> You always thought I was,<br> but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.<br> That fuckin' pimp cocksucker.<br> He's lucky I didn't<br> kill him last time.<br> Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.<br> If you would have stayed with Amy...<br> and you would have ran away,<br> he would have been fuckin' dead.<br> Both of you. Dead. Dead.<br> # Dreamin' dreams of you<br> Little babe ##<br> No,<br> it isn't right. It isn't fair.<br> Yes.<br> He doesn't come home at night.<br> What is the big fuckin' deal?<br> I go... Listen, I just<br> can't fuckin' take it.<br> Why should I fuckin' take it?<br> That wasn't the deal.<br> He acts like I'm the only one<br> around here with a fuckin' past.<br> He'll never let me<br> live it down.<br> Well, yes, I have tried.<br> Of course I've tried.<br> What the fuck do you think<br> I came back here for?<br> No, I'm not.<br> I want to have him killed.<br> Yes, I want him killed.<br> I've fuckin' had it.<br> So are you with me on this?<br> You want to get rid of me?<br> Here I am.<br> Go ahead.<br> Get rid of me.<br> - Hello.<br> - Yes, I do!<br> I fuckin' hate you!<br> I can't take it anymore!<br> - Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!<br> - You hate my guts?<br> - I'm sick of being with you!<br> - I want you to come with me now!<br> Come with me now. Come with me now.<br> - I want you out.<br> I want you out of here.<br> - I want you out of here!<br> I want you out of here!<br> Take your fuckin' bag<br> and get out of here!<br> I'll go, but I want<br> my money right now!<br> - You'll get your money! Don't worry.<br> - The arrangement is over.<br> - No kidding!<br> - And I still get my money.<br> I need some cash right now!<br> You can't just put me in the street!<br> You haven't been straight<br> with me ever since I met you!<br> You never even loved me<br> in the first place!<br> I need eyes in the back<br> of my head with you, you fuckin' bitch!<br> How could I love you?<br> You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!<br> - You're lower than a dog!<br> - Fuck you!<br> Here! Here!<br> Is this enough money?<br> Will it last you<br> two fuckin' days? Take it!<br> - Greedy bitch. Take the fuckin' money.<br> - I'm going to the bank...<br> - and I'm getting my jewelry too!<br> - It opens at 9:00 a. m.<br> Don't send your guys down there<br> to stop me! I mean it!<br> I guarantee you,<br> I will not stop you.<br> You're not getting rid of me<br> with one fucking suitcase!<br> Come back tomorrow and get the rest.<br> Just get out of here. Fine!<br> - I'm taking Amy.<br> - You're not taking Amy.<br> I am.<br> I'm waking her up right now.<br> You're stoned. You're a junkie.<br> Get out of here.<br> - I am not! She's my daughter too!<br> - Get out of here!<br> Send my lawyers a letter,<br> god-fuckin'- damn you!<br> You're not getting away with this!<br> You're not gonna cheat me out of my end!<br> Fucker!<br> The funny thing was,<br> after all that, I didn't want her to go.<br> She was the mother of my kid.<br> I loved her.<br> And later, I realized I didn't want<br> to give her the money...<br> because if I did,<br> I knew I'd never see her again.<br> - Oh. Have a good day at school, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Okay, angel.<br> From now on, I have to know<br> where you and Amy are at all times.<br> Here's a beeper.<br> I want you<br> to keep it on you.<br> It's very light.<br> So I can call you<br> whenever I have to.<br> Okay?<br> What are you supposed to do?<br> What do you want to do?<br> You want to stay the way you are?<br> You can't do that.<br> Listen, two people don't get along,<br> at some point you gotta call it.<br> It's none of my business,<br> but I think that's what you gotta do.<br> You're right.<br> I know.<br> - I was just...<br> - What? What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What were you gonna say?<br> - I don't...<br> - Tell me what you were gonna say.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> I was thinking maybe<br> you know somebody at the bank...<br> who could help me<br> get my jewelry out?<br> There's a lot<br> of money in there.<br> I'd be willing to take care<br> of anybody who helped me out.<br> - Let me think about that.<br> - Okay.<br> Let me see who I got. Gotta get<br> somebody I can trust, you know?<br> - You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.<br> - Hmm.<br> He holds that key so tight,<br> he's probably got it stuck up his ass.<br> You're right. That's Sammy.<br> And he's probably<br> got it there too.<br> He's so fuckin' lucky.<br> I could have buried him.<br> I could have gone to Europe<br> and taken the baby.<br> - Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.<br> - No, he wouldn't.<br> I would have.<br> - He'd have been right too. Seriously.<br> - Come on.<br> - You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.<br> - I didn't.<br> I mean, I did, but then I did exactly<br> what you told me to do, and I came back.<br> - You did. You're right. You did. I like that.<br> - Exactly what you said.<br> - That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.<br> - I did what you told me.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - Because you always tell me the right thing to do.<br> Yeah.<br> # And now that it's all over ##<br> He really fucked himself up<br> out here, didn't he?<br> - He sure did.<br> - Everything went to his head.<br> - Changed.<br> - Changed.<br> - He did. He ain't the same person.<br> - No, he's not.<br> - He really thinks who the fuck he is.<br> - Exactly.<br> He hates me.<br> He hates my fuckin' guts.<br> Come on, come on.<br> You're a toughie. You can take this.<br> - Don't cry.<br> - I'm not as tough as you think I am.<br> Yes, you are.<br> I'm not, and he scares<br> the shit out of me.<br> - I never know what he's gonna do.<br> - Come on.<br> - Don't be scared.<br> - I need some help. I do.<br> I need some help.<br> You gotta help me.<br> I need a new sponsor, Nicky.<br> I do.<br> I need a new sponsor.<br> - Is that what you want?<br> - Yeah.<br> - A sponsor?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Nobody will fuck<br> with you anymore.<br> - I'll take care of you. Yes, I will.<br> - Take care of me.<br> - It's what you want, isn't it?<br> - Thank you. Yeah.<br> - Yeah. Uh-huh.<br> - It's what you want?<br> # Yes, it came from your pen, dear,<br> but not from your heart #<br> - # The third king<br> The joke of the deck #<br> # You ended your letter enclosed<br> "Please sign my check" #<br> - That's Ace's wife.<br> - # Why, you fool #<br> - # You poor, sad, worthless foolish fool #<br> - Fantastic.<br> # If you think that money can pay<br> for the hard years I've suffered #<br> # 'Til things broke your way #<br> - This is great for the boss.<br> - # I'm answering your last letter that says we must part #<br> # I'm tearing up the pieces<br> the way you tore up my heart #<br> # I smile when you kiss me<br> and I thrill at your touch #<br> # My only sin was<br> I loved you much too much #<br> # Win a little #<br> # Lose a little ##<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - You didn't answer your beeper.<br> - I threw it away.<br> You threw it away?<br> I tried to do this thing. I know that<br> you want me to, but it's just...<br> I'm driving down the freeway and the<br> fuckin' thing's beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!<br> I'm in a restaurant,<br> it's embarrassing.<br> I don't want to do it anymore.<br> Where's Amy?<br> - I put her to bed.<br> - Oh.<br> I got your cigarettes.<br> Oscar wants you to call him.<br> - So who'd you go to lunch with?<br> - Jennifer.<br> - Where'd you go?<br> - To the Riviera.<br> What'd you have?<br> - I had a salad.<br> - What did Jennifer have?<br> She had the same.<br> Okay.<br> I want you<br> to call Jennifer...<br> and I want you to tell her<br> to tell you what you had for lunch.<br> I'm gonna listen in<br> on the other line.<br> - Why do you want to do that?<br> - You know why.<br> - Just do it.<br> - Fine.<br> I just need to get<br> the bowl for my thing.<br> The line's busy.<br> There's nobody there.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.<br> All right.<br> I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.<br> Okay.<br> Who were you with?<br> I was with somebody.<br> I know you were with somebody.<br> Who was it?<br> I just hope it's not someone<br> who I think it might be.<br> I just hope it's not that.<br> I knew she fucked around.<br> She did what she did,<br> and I did what I had to do...<br> but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing<br> she could have done.<br> What if he won't stop?<br> It could get us both killed.<br> I can back him off.<br> She was<br> very convincing when she wanted to be.<br> And this is how<br> she backed him off.<br> Hey, Ginger.<br> Don't forget,<br> if you're challenged...<br> if he asks anything,<br> deny everything.<br> You understand? I don't want him<br> bringing beefs back home.<br> That could really cause<br> a serious problem.<br> Got to be careful.<br> He's not dumb, you know?<br> You hear what I'm saying, right?<br> I know. You don't have<br> to tell me that.<br> What? Do you think I'm stupid?<br> Do I think you're stupid? No.<br> I think you're beautiful.<br> But I gotta go.<br> By this time, Nicky had things<br> so fucked up on the streets...<br> that every time Marino went back home,<br> the packages got smaller and smaller.<br> It got to the point,<br> when he walked into the place...<br> he didn't know whether he was<br> going to be kissed or killed.<br> Frankie,<br> I want to ask you something.<br> It's private.<br> But I want you<br> to tell me the truth.<br> Of course, Remo.<br> I want you to tell me<br> the truth, mind you.<br> I always tell you<br> the truth, Remo.<br> Frankie... the little guy...<br> he wouldn't be fucking<br> the Jew's wife, would he?<br> Because if he is,<br> it's a problem.<br> What could I say?<br> I knew if I gave<br> the wrong answer...<br> Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them<br> could have wound up gettin' killed.<br> Because there's one thing<br> about these old-timers.<br> They don't like any fucking around<br> with the other guys' wives.<br> It's bad for business.<br> So I lied, even though I knew<br> that by lying to Gaggi...<br> I could wind up<br> gettin' killed too.<br> - No, I ain't seen anything like that.<br> - Are you sure?<br> I'm positive.<br> Remo, things are very<br> fucked up down there.<br> I know.<br> That's why I'm asking.<br> - You see, my main concern is Nicky.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> I want to know if he's<br> doing all right, if he's okay.<br> - He's good. He's fine.<br> - I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.<br> - Do it for me.<br> - No problem.<br> I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing<br> anything for our friends. Understand?<br> - I understand.<br> - Okay.<br> Frankie, you're a good boy.<br> Thanks, Remo.<br> By now, Nicky and his crew<br> had already hit rock bottom.<br> Vegas really got to him.<br> The booze, the coke, the broads.<br> I mean, he got sloppy.<br> He just wasn't<br> the same Nicky anymore.<br> - You must have drank too much.<br> - Go fuck yourself.<br> One night he had<br> to belt a guy three times...<br> before the guy<br> finally went down.<br> In the old days, Nicky would have<br> decked him with one shot.<br> You add this into the mix...<br> Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.<br> His crew followed him<br> right over the edge.<br> They were all tuned up<br> half the time on coke.<br> They started doing stupid things.<br> The worst was Blue.<br> - Hey, what do you guys want?<br> - Police! Stay in the car!<br> He never knew<br> when to keep his mouth shut.<br> - Drop the gun!<br> - Fuck you!<br> The cops shot Blue...<br> - because they thought<br> his hero sandwich was a gun.<br> - They could have been right, but who knows?<br> - Jesus Christ!<br> What gun? He's got<br> a fuckin' hero sandwich here.<br> - What do you want? It's pitch black.<br> - Pitch black!<br> - It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!<br> - You fuckin' moron!<br> - I'll be fillin' out paperwork for the next two months!<br> - What are we gonna do?<br> - I'm sorry!<br> - You jerk-off!<br> To get even,<br> Nicky's crew got stoned one night...<br> and they started shooting up<br> the cops' houses.<br> It got to the point where they couldn't<br> talk in the Gold Rush anymore...<br> because the Feds<br> put a wire in the wall.<br> Even when they talked outside,<br> they had to cover their mouths...<br> - Shit, he's covering up again.<br> - Because the Feds brought in lip readers.<br> Nicky found out from a teller<br> who owed him money.<br> He asked me again<br> about you and the Jew's wife.<br> Walk, walk, walk.<br> What'd you say?<br> He asked me again about you<br> and the Jew's wife.<br> Yeah?<br> What'd you tell him?<br> I told him<br> I didn't know nothin'.<br> Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said<br> if you did anything, you're fucked up.<br> You think he's going home<br> making a beef behind my back?<br> Nah, you would have<br> heard something.<br> - What's to stop him?<br> - I know, I know.<br> I don't trust him anymore,<br> but they'd never okay anything.<br> Yeah, but they keep<br> asking about it.<br> Sure they're asking.<br> They earn with the prick.<br> I got a funny feeling he's gonna start<br> a fuckin' war or something.<br> I'm not sure yet,<br> but you know what I want you to do?<br> Who's this guy?<br> Who's this guy?<br> That ain't nobody.<br> You know what<br> I want you to do?<br> Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the<br> desert, then let them show you where it's at.<br> - Angelo and Buster.<br> - Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.<br> - They'll do it.<br> - When I'm ready, I'll say the word.<br> - Go see the Jew, and you make it disappear.<br> - Yeah.<br> Just let me know.<br> But you got to be ready.<br> You know what<br> I'm talkin' about?<br> Did I say<br> to do anything yet?<br> I said I'm not sure. I'll let<br> you know. I want to think about it.<br> Where are these pricks at?<br> Dominick said they're in the motel?<br> There or in the fuckin' bank.<br> I don't know.

Get inside.<br> - Can you believe that?<br> - Look at this motherfucker.<br> Whew.<br> I fucked up, Frankie.<br> I fucked up good this time.<br> I should never have started<br> with this fuckin' broad.<br> Take it easy.<br> What could you do?<br> I mean, she threw herself<br> at you, right?<br> I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here.<br> You know that?<br> A bad fuckin' spot.<br> I'd already left<br> the kid with neighbors...<br> and I had about a million<br> in cash and jewels...<br> that I gave to Sherbert<br> to lock up in the hotel.<br> Put it in the hotel safe,<br> then I want you to come right back.<br> - She's alone.<br> Take the gun and go into Amy's...<br> - Wait there for me.<br> Get out here and talk to me!<br> You fuckin' ignore me,<br> you motherfucker!<br> I mean it!<br> Come down here right now!<br> Get down here<br> and talk to me, goddamn it!<br> Fuck you!<br> Goddamn you, come out here!<br> I'm going to drive your fucking<br> car through the living room!<br> You fucking coward!<br> You motherfucker!<br> - Come out here and talk to me, you fucker!<br> - Will you stop it?<br> - You're drunk. You're on drugs.<br> - I am not!<br> - You're going to be sorry if you don't stop it.<br> - Don't you threaten me!<br> You are not<br> threatening me anymore!<br> You fuck! You fuck!<br> I'm sick of you!<br> I am fucking Nicky Santoro!<br> I am! He's my new sponsor!<br> How about that, you fuckhead!<br> What are you looking at?<br> Fuck off!<br> Hey. Go back inside!<br> This is none of your business!<br> I don't have to take your shit<br> all the time anymore!<br> I'm going to the F.B.I.!<br> I will go to the police!<br> - I am not protecting you anymore, you fuck!<br> - Mrs. Rothstein... Shh.<br> He won't let me inside!<br> Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've been<br> getting some complaints about the noise.<br> - I'm trying to get in my house. He won't let me in.<br> - I understand.<br> I won't let her in. I'm sorry,<br> Randy, I'm not gonna let her in.<br> - I'm not gonna let her in the way she's behaving.<br> - Not gonna let me in?<br> - Who knows what you're gonna do in there.<br> - What am I gonna do?<br> I've been in the same<br> clothes for two days!<br> - I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!<br> - Okay.<br> How about if we just let her<br> in the house to get a few things?<br> - This is half her house anyway.<br> - I'm afraid to let her in the house.<br> You aren't afraid, you fucker!<br> - I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.<br> - Let me in the house!<br> - Hey, hey, hey!<br> - Fucker! Fucker!<br> Hold on! Hey! Please!<br> You ought to be afraid,<br> the way you fuckin' treat me!<br> - It'll make it easier...<br> - If we let her get her things...<br> - we'll be out of your hair.<br> - If she calms down, I will let her in the house...<br> - I am calm!<br> - If she calms down...<br> I will let her in the house<br> for five minutes...<br> if you gentlemen will escort her out<br> if she happens to not want to leave.<br> - Can I go in? Can I go in?<br> - That's not a problem.<br> - Jeff, would you go in with her?<br> - Yes. Yes. Fine! Fuck you!<br> You wouldn't believe how mean he's been to<br> me. He's locked up most of my important stuff.<br> All my papers and things... I have to<br> get them. So don't let him come up here.<br> I know they're in here<br> in the desk... Fuck.<br> Just pay attention.<br> He could come up here at any time.<br> Are you watching for him?<br> Got 'em.<br> I don't want her in there<br> more than a few more minutes.<br> No, it'll just be a couple...<br> We got other things to do too.<br> I'll hurry her up.<br> - How's everything else besides this?<br> - Fine. Fine.<br> - How's your family?<br> - Not bad. In fact, my wife's pregnant again.<br> - Oh, good. Congratulations.<br> - Thanks. Yeah.<br> We're kind of happy<br> about that.<br> I just have to get this one more<br> thing and then we can go.<br> Shit! Fuck!<br> Shit! God!<br> Oh, that pisses me off!<br> Don't worry about it.<br> And it would be great...<br> if you guys could just<br> follow me out of here...<br> because he's been<br> threatening me!<br> Take care. Thank you.<br> I can't believe this.<br> I just need to pick up a little cash<br> inside. Could you come with me?<br> - Charlie, you've got to stop her. You've got to stop her.<br> - I'm sorry, Sam.<br> - What can I do?<br> - She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind!<br> She has the keys.<br> It's still in both your names.<br> - Oh!<br> - There's nothing I can do. I'd like to help...<br> - but I can't.<br> - Legally, she can't take that stuff.<br> Legally, she can't take that stuff. Half<br> of everything is mine. Ace, listen to me.<br> - There's nothing I can do.<br> - Half... I'm coming down.<br> Shit! Goddamn it!<br> Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could<br> just ask the guy for the big bag.<br> - Go get a bag, man.<br> - Here, here.<br> - Lady, I can't take it.<br> - No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me.<br> - Yes, just hold the top open.<br> All right? And I can...<br> Oh, God, it's him.<br> You have to stop him.<br> He said he was gonna kill me.<br> You should just stop him.<br> Mr. Roth... Mr. Roth...<br> Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.<br> Hold on a second. Hey.<br> - She's driving away.<br> There's nothing we can do.<br> - There's nothing we can do.<br> - Look, look, look.<br> You can't stop her for speeding?<br> Look what she's doing.<br> - There's nothing we can do. She had the keys.<br> - She's on the account.<br> - Let's pull her over at that Citgo station.<br> - Okay. Let's do it.<br> - We're placing you under arrest for...<br> - For what?<br> - We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...<br> - For what?<br> - We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting...<br> - But I'm just trying to leave.<br> After all<br> the threats and all the bullshit...<br> it turned out Ginger<br> didn't tell them anything.<br> - But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.<br> - But it was mine.<br> - They had all the pieces they needed.<br> - But I didn't do anything.<br> - Everybody began to tumble, one after the other, like dominoes.<br> - F.B.I.! We have a warrant!<br> Between Piscano<br> complaining on the wire...<br> between Nicky, Ginger,<br> me and my license...<br> - Paradise. We managed<br> to really fuck it all up.<br> - Mom.<br> - Yeah, someone's at the fuckin' door now.<br> F.B.I. We have<br> a federal search warrant.<br> I got wind of the pinches<br> coming down, so I took off.<br> Who needs to hang around<br> for that bullshit?<br> - My name is Mark Casper. Special Agent F.B.I.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Can I make a fuckin' phone call?<br> - Hey, hold it a minute.<br> You can make a phone call, but you<br> don't have to talk to us like that.<br> Everybody, out of the room.<br> Over to the alarm.<br> They got almost everybody else.<br> - This area is seized!<br> - Get the master account list.<br> - I want all those papers seized regardless of what they are.<br> Put every box on the table.<br> Ah, yes. Here we are.<br> Little craps figures.<br> Green? Don't even ask.<br> - $30,000 of yours.<br> - No, he didn't. That's why it wasn't valid.<br> I was being extorted. I'm willing<br> to tell you whatever you want to know.<br> - I've got nothing to hide here.<br> - Now for the best.<br> I couldn't believe this shit.<br> Piscano's expense reports took the cake.<br> - Oh, this is good. Bingo.<br> - He might as well have given them a fuckin' blueprint.<br> Everybody's names, addresses,<br> dates, everything.<br> Look at this. Thank you so much,<br> Mr. Piscano. How considerate of you.<br> - Those are my mother's books.<br> - You're under arrest.<br> What a fuckin' balloon-head.<br> - What are you guys doing?<br> - Take it easy.<br> - Wait!<br> - Wait a minute! He's sick! Oh, God!<br> - Move back.<br> - I think it's his heart! Oh, God! Is he breathing?<br> - C.P.R. Now!<br> Poor Artie. He got so upset,<br> he had a heart attack...<br> and dropped dead right<br> in front of his wife.<br> - Calm down!<br> - Artie! No, I won't calm down!<br> - He's my husband! Artie! Artie!<br> - We can't help him if...<br> And at the end of the day...<br> they finally came to see me<br> with the pictures.<br> Why protect a friend<br> who betrayed you like that?<br> But I didn't want to look at them.<br> I didn't want to look at the guys<br> who brought them either.<br> Your Honor, as you can see,<br> my clients are elderly and infirm.<br> Any incarceration could<br> pose a serious health risk.<br> When the bosses were arrested,<br> some of them were so old...<br> they needed doctors<br> at their arraignment.<br> Pre-trial Services recommends<br> that bail remain as presently set.<br> - We're going to take a recess.<br> - When it looked like they could get...<br> just for skimmin' a casino...<br> sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew<br> people were going to get clipped.<br> So, the day of the arraignment, they had this<br> meeting right in the back of the courthouse.<br> See, when something like this happens,<br> you know how things are gonna work out.<br> It's always better with no witnesses.<br> So what about Andy?<br> He won't talk.<br> Stone is a good kid.<br> Stand-up guy<br> just like his old man.<br> That's the way I see it.<br> I agree. He's solid.<br> He's a fuckin' Marine.<br> He's okay. He always was.<br> Remo, what do you think?<br> Look... why take a chance?<br> At least, that's the way<br> I feel about it.<br> Call Artie. Tell him,<br> I don't care what...<br> - he's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.<br> - It's done.<br> It's terribly important. I gotta have<br> a conversation with that guy...<br> As much as they liked him,<br> I mean, he wasn't one of us.<br> He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew,<br> he could have talked.<br> Otherwise,<br> Stoney might still be alive.<br> The first one to skip<br> was John Nance.<br> He found a nice, warm,<br> secluded place in Costa Rica.<br> - He thought nobody<br> would find him there.<br> But then his kid got nabbed<br> by the Feds for drugs.<br> So, naturally, the bosses were<br> afraid he'd come out of hiding...<br> just to save his kid<br> and give them all up.<br> So...<br> Where you goin', jag-off?<br> But, anyway,<br> they all had to follow.<br> Everybody went down.<br> Fuck you.<br> Before you knew it...<br> anybody who knew anything<br> wound up gettin' whacked.<br> Oh, no! No! No!<br> After Ginger took off,<br> she wasn't much help to anybody.<br> She found some pimps, lowlifes,<br> druggies and bikers in L.A.<br> In a few months, they went through<br> all the money and all the jewels.<br> After they found her body...<br> I had a private doctor<br> do another autopsy.<br> He said they gave her<br> a hot dose.<br> In the end, all she had left was 3,600<br> in mint condition coins.<br> No matter what the Feds or the papers<br> might have said about my car bombing...<br> it was amateur night,<br> you could tell.<br> Whoever it was, they put<br> the dynamite under the passenger side.<br> But what they didn't know,<br> what nobody outside the factory knew...<br> was that that model car was made with<br> a metal plate under the driver's seat.<br> It's the only thing<br> that saved my life.<br> The bombing was never authorized,<br> but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.<br> - Hey, Nicky.<br> And so did the powers that be.<br> - How are you?<br> - How you doin'?<br> It took months<br> for everything to calm down.<br> But, finally,<br> my guys got out on bail...<br> and the bosses wanted me to send<br> my brother Dominick out to Vegas.<br> Always the dollars.<br> Always the fuckin' dollars.<br> I mean, it was still way too hot<br> for me to even go near Vegas.<br> So I set up a meeting<br> with the guys way out in the sticks.<br> I didn't want my brother to get fucked<br> around. I mean, what's right is right.<br> They don't give a fuck about...<br> Holy fuckin'!<br> What the fuck...<br> Come on, motherfucker!<br> - Tough guys!<br> You and your fuckin' brother!<br> - You fuckin' scumbags!<br> No more!<br> - Frankie!<br> - No more! You see? Watch!<br> - Frankie! Frankie! You piece of shit!<br> - Fuck you, you motherfucker!<br> Fuckin' punk,<br> motherfucker! Piece of shit!<br> No, no, no, no!<br> Take this motherfucker out!<br> Frankie, leave the kid alone.<br> He's still breathing.<br> He's still breathing.<br> Leave him alone. Frankie.<br> All right. Strip him.<br> No balls.<br> You got no fuckin' balls.<br> Ah, Dominick. Ah, Dom.<br> Dominick. Dominick.<br> Dominick.<br> Oh, Dominick.<br> Come on, come on.<br> - Bury them?<br> - Bury them.<br> The word was out.<br> The bosses had enough of Nicky.<br> They had enough.<br> How much were they gonna take? So they<br> made an example of him and his brother.<br> - They buried them<br> while they were still breathing.<br> Mister, you all right?<br> Watch out!<br> - Mister, you all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> They had other ideas for me.<br> We need some help over here!<br> You sure are lucky, mister.<br> The town will never be the same.<br> After the Tangiers,<br> the big corporations took it all over.<br> Today it looks like Disneyland.<br> And while the kids<br> play cardboard pirates...<br> Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments<br> and Junior's college money...<br> on the poker slots.<br> In the old days, dealers knew your name,<br> what you drank, what you played.<br> Today, it's like checkin'<br> into an airport.<br> And if you order room service,<br> you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.<br> Today it's all gone. You got a whale<br> show up with four million in a suitcase...<br> and some 25-year-old hotel school kid is<br> gonna want his social security number.<br> After the Teamsters<br> got knocked out of the box...<br> the corporations tore down practically<br> every one of the old casinos.<br> And where did the money come<br> from to rebuild the Pyramids?<br> Junk bonds.<br> Still not sure?<br> Probable. Maybe questionable.<br> Let me know as soon<br> as you can find out.<br> But in the end, I wound up<br> right back where I started.<br> I could still pick winners...<br> and I could still make money<br> for all kinds of people back home.<br> And why mess up a good thing?<br> And that's that.<br> # Sometimes I wonder why<br> I spend the lonely nights #<br> # Dreaming of a song #<br> # The melody<br> haunts my memory #<br> # And I am once again with you #<br> # When our love was new #<br> # And each kiss an inspiration #<br> # Ah, but that was long ago #<br> # And now my consolation #<br> # Is in the stardust of a song #<br> # Beside a garden wall #<br> # When stars were bright #<br> # And you were in my arms #<br> # The nightingale<br> told his fairy tale #<br> # Of paradise #<br> # Where roses grew #<br> # Though I dream in vain #<br> # In my heart #<br> # It will remain #<br> # My stardust melody #<br> # The memory #<br> # Of love's refrain ##<br>
