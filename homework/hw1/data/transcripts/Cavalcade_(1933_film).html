Of course I will.<br> - No, no, no, I insist.<br> - Now, I can easily let myself out.<br> - Very well.<br> And a happy New Year to you.<br> - Bless you both.<br> - Good night, dear.<br> The same to you.<br> Twice over.<br> Well, Robert, here we go again.<br> One more year behind us.<br> One more year before us.<br> - Do you mind?<br> - No.<br> Everything passes, even time.<br> That means you do.<br> And you don't?<br> I still believe in the future.<br> Ah, that's your strength, my dear.<br> I believe in the future, too,<br> but not quite in the same way.<br> It's been quite an adventure,<br> our life together.<br> A great adventure, Robert.<br> Anxious sometimes and sad.<br> Sometimes unbelievably happy.<br> But thank God, never dull or sordid.<br> And most of it<br> has come to us in this house...<br> - In this very room.<br> - Yes.<br> Sometimes I've almost hated it.<br> - You wouldn't move?<br> - Oh, my dear, of course not.<br> Well, we might have<br> some new curtains, of course.<br> - We have, dear.<br> - Hmm?<br> Have we?<br> Oh, so we have. I never noticed.<br> - They've only been up a week.<br> - Oh! (CHUCKLES)<br> Dear Robert.<br> In one minute,<br> (CORK POPS)<br> it will be 1933.<br> Well, Robert, what toast have you<br> in mind for tonight?<br> - Something gay and original, I hope.<br> - No, just the future.<br> Our old friend, the future...<br> The future of England.<br> But first of all, my dear...<br> I drink to you.<br> And I drink to you, Robert.<br> Loyal and loving, always.<br> Now, let's couple the future of England<br> with the past of England...<br> The glories, the victories,<br> the triumphs that are over.<br> And the sorrows that are over, too.<br> Let us drink to our sons<br> who made part of the pattern.<br> And to our hearts that died with them.<br> Let us drink to the spirit<br> of gallantry and courage<br> that made a strange heaven<br> out of unbelievable hell.<br> And let us drink to the hope<br> that one day this country of ours,<br> which we love so much,<br> will find dignity<br> and greatness and peace again.<br> But this poison gas gives us security.<br> The world must disarm.<br> The whole world's broke. We're all broke.<br> God is a superstition...<br> if he shall gain the whole world,<br> and lose his own soul.<br> (NO AUDIBLE DIALOG)<br> In the strange illusion, chaos and confusion<br> People seem to lose their way<br> (NO AUDIBLE DIALOG)<br> Dignity...<br> Greatness and peace.<br> (PEOPLE SINGING)<br> (SINGING CONTINUES)<br> (ORCHESTRA PLAYS)<br>
