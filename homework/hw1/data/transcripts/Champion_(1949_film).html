the mirror.<br> You're not a kid anymore.<br> So I don't wanna hear<br> your sorry story.<br> Boxers spend more time<br> at the mirror than Miss Koreas.<br> It's not just<br> about your posture<br> but also about fighting<br> your own self in that mirror.<br> Understand?<br> If a boxer loses<br> his will to fight<br> he becomes vulnerable.<br> Even if something's broken<br> and you're in pain<br> never let your face<br> show it.<br> When your opponent<br> senses your weakness<br> he becomes<br> twice as powerful.<br> Why did you and l<br> decide on boxing?<br> Because we only had<br> our limbs to rely on.<br> From now on, you'll fight<br> that person in front of you.<br> Just beat<br> that one opponent.<br> Winning is not<br> necessarily victory.<br> It's giving<br> everything you got.<br> That's a true champion.<br> You got that?<br> Sing me a song.<br> Sir?<br> To play a fair game with<br> the person in front of you<br> sing a song<br> for a good match.<br> What is boxing?<br> Is it beating?<br> Or getting beaten?<br> When I hit<br> it's like a dream<br> When I get hit<br> it's like a nightmare<br> I laugh when I win<br> I cry when I lose<br> Living until this day<br> Living until this day<br> In a boxer's heart<br> No one knows even today<br> That I'm punching<br> the sandbag<br> What a great fight.<br> Deuk-gu Kim wins!<br> Deuk-gu Kim's<br> the new champion!<br> He's raising<br> his fists in triumph.<br> Deuk-gu Kim<br> is the new champion!<br> What a great fight.<br> Nothing can stop<br> him from reaching the world title now.<br> This is an encouragement prize<br> from Mirim Electronics.<br> Go thank them<br> in person tomorrow.<br> Go on!<br> You deserve a drink!<br> Aren't you coming, sir?<br> I need to make a few calls,<br> so go ahead first.<br> Tonight's on me, so feed<br> the guys and call me later.<br> Yes, sir!<br> Have fun.<br> Where's Deuk-gu?<br> He's in the office.<br> What are you doing?<br> Hurry up,<br> so we can celebrate!<br> I'm gonna shower,<br> so go ahead!<br> Okay, but hurry up!<br> Let's get going.<br> I'm happy<br> I'm happy<br> I'm so happy<br> I'm happy<br> I'm happy<br> I'm so happy<br> Now I'd like to ask<br> our proud champion of Go-sung<br> to say a few words to us.<br> Our family, like our town<br> had no money or status.<br> In fact, we were the poorest<br> in the neighborhood.<br> But my heart was not poor!<br> Why?<br> Because I had<br> my hometown's wide beaches<br> and the crimson sun at sunrise!<br> A man<br> should have a heart as deep<br> and as wide as that ocean.<br> Also<br> Deuk-gu is a dog!<br> Deuk-gu is a dog<br> with different dads!<br> I'm going to school now.<br> Do your best.<br> To win by all means<br> I will shed blood,<br> sweat, and tears<br> and give everything I have<br> to become the<br> next world champion!<br> One more.<br> Don't you wanna<br> take a picture?<br> You go ahead<br> and take a lot.<br> Are you upset<br> about something?<br> Is your health<br> ruined yet?<br> I have something<br> to tell you, Mom.<br> Please give<br> them a round of applause.<br> Now the preacher will bless<br> them for their happy days ahead.<br> Let's pray.<br> With Jesus Christ's blessing<br> and our Father's eternal love<br> filling us with the Grace<br> of the Holy Spirit<br> I'd like to sincerely pray<br> that as from this engagement,<br> they live happily forever.<br> Love will protect all<br> T o hope, trust,<br> and persevere<br> Love will last forever<br> Hey, look that way!<br> Becoming a boxer<br> has made me into a new person.<br> If I hadn't learned how to box<br> I might've ended up<br> as a ruthless street thug.<br> In my battle<br> against my own self<br> I believed<br> that I would win.<br> So I'm certain that<br> I'll be able to overcome<br> any obstacle<br> that may come my way.<br> Thank you.<br> We hope boxer Deuk-gu Kim<br> continues to be victorious.<br> Thank you.<br> That was WBA Lightweight<br> Asia-Pacific Champ Deuk-gu Kim.<br> How about<br> a serious pose?<br> Behind you.<br> Hey, what are<br> you two doing?<br> Great!<br> Thank you<br> for the interview.<br> It was an honor.<br> We'll send you<br> a copy of the photo.<br> Have a nice day!<br> Watch.<br> When you box,<br> you don't use your fists.<br> You use<br> your legs and back.<br> Do it.<br> Dummy, I said use your back.<br> Watch.<br> Hello, sir.<br> Hey.<br> Deuk-gu.<br> What?<br> Jong-pal.<br> Is something wrong?<br> My world title match<br> got postponed.<br> Wanna go together?<br> No, that's okay.<br> I'm gonna visit<br> my hometown.<br> Save your breath.<br> So Jong-pal vs. Haggler<br> won't be a popular match, right?<br> So they want to break the<br> contract and pay the penalties?<br> That's right.<br> He's also<br> in a very difficult spot.<br> He said he's very sorry<br> and is willing to pay you today.<br> Forget it.<br> Tell him no.<br> Pardon?<br> I said I don't want it.<br> He doesn't want the money.<br> Okay.<br> It's more<br> than $100,000.<br> Tell him<br> exactly what I'll say.<br> I train boxers<br> and promote fights.<br> I don't take money<br> for a canceled match.<br> I get paid<br> to put together a fight.<br> I don't take money<br> for a canceled fight.<br> Instead, I know you have someone<br> who can fight in a title match.<br> I'd like my guy<br> to fight him.<br> I know you have other boxers<br> waiting for the world title.<br> I also have<br> a great boxing mind.<br> Okay. You want<br> a new contract?<br> He asks if you<br> want a new contract.<br> Ah, no, no, no,<br> no problem, no problem.<br> Well, how do you know<br> you can trust me?<br> Tell him that I know<br> he was a boxer, too.<br> And boxers usually<br> don't know how to cheat people.<br> I know you fought<br> in the ring once, too.<br> If there is one thing<br> I know<br> boxers don't lie<br> to each other.<br> Okay.<br> Doesn't it hurt<br> when you get hit?<br> You can't always<br> be hitting.<br> You're too pumped up<br> to feel anything.<br> Until you see your face<br> after the game.<br> At our engagement<br> you looked so handsome<br> in a suit.<br> Can't you wear<br> a suit every day?<br> When I become a world champion<br> and make a lot of money<br> I'll wear a suit every day.<br> He's already waiting for you.<br> Chances like this are rare.<br> Think about my offer.<br> There's no use<br> being under him.<br> Think about it carefully.<br> Sang-bong,<br> long time no see.<br> I'll be going now.<br> Bye.<br> What was that about?<br> Right.<br> I think<br> he likes you, too.<br> He wants us<br> to come by his gym later.<br> I'm on my way<br> to see Mirim's president.<br> Wanna come?<br> I'm meeting<br> the boxing league chairman soon.<br> Maybe later.<br> Deuk-gu, the Dog!<br> Let's spar!<br> Are you embarrassed?<br> Deuk-gu, the Dog,<br> you're just a tadpole.<br> What's going on here?<br> Who told you to spar<br> without my permission?<br> A tadpole dies out of water.<br> Now that you're a frog<br> and can survive on your own<br> do you think you can ignore those<br> who helped you in the water?<br> You rotten frog.<br> I'm quitting boxing tomorrow.<br> Why?<br> I already found a new job.<br> Sang-bong!<br> Coach wasn't in my corner<br> in the last match.<br> It felt worse than the time I<br> went to see my old man long ago.<br> Is he strong?<br> Who?<br> Mancini?<br> His old man<br> was a famous boxer.<br> He couldn't win the world title<br> because of the war<br> but I heard he was good.<br> So I guess his son<br> won the title for his father.<br> Then he must be strong.<br> I guess one of us<br> will die fighting.<br> How can you say that?<br> Don't cry.<br> I'm not going there<br> to die.<br> I'll come back<br> with a victory.<br> Don't come<br> to the airport.<br> Once I win the title,<br> we'll get married for real.<br> Be a little more patient, okay?<br> For some people<br> gambling is like a drug.<br> They get high,<br> they crash and they can't stop.<br> Ohh, playing hard to get, huh?<br> Deuk-gu, Deuk-gu.<br> Deuk-gu, wake up.<br> That's enough!<br> Can I ask you something?<br> Sure.<br> Coach.<br> If your son wants to be<br> a boxer like Mancini<br> would you let him?<br> If he wants to<br> I guess I will.<br> How about you?<br> To be honest<br> I don't know.<br> Fight To Death<br> Who is it?<br> Right.<br> Is Yoon-gu asleep?<br> Yes, sir.<br> How do you feel?<br> Things like these are supposed<br> to be said inside your mind.<br> Get some sleep.<br> Good night, sir.<br> Mancini and Deuk-gu<br> Kim are matching lefts and rights.<br> It's still neck to neck<br> in this Las Vegas fight.<br> That's it! Keep it up!<br> But Mancini<br> seems to be leading.<br> His glove strap<br> seems to be broken.<br> I'm wondering if he's relying<br> on that fist too much.<br> Thankfully he's gotten this far<br> without too many bruises.<br> The fight is resumed.<br> That's it! Hit him!<br> What? What's going on?<br> Are you alright?<br> Only two more rounds to go!<br> You fought well up till now<br> and did your best!<br> He's exhausted too<br> so as soon as it starts,<br> go left for his body!<br> Deuk-gu, are you listening?<br> Deuk-gu!<br> Do what I said!<br> Give it all you got!<br> Deuk-gu Kim was just shown<br> being taken out on a stretcher.<br> Deuk-gu Kim fought well<br> with "Boom Boom" Mancini<br> and gave it all he's got<br> for 14 rounds.<br> But Deuk-gu was knocked down<br> after 19 seconds in the 14th<br> and hit his head as he fell.<br> It seems like Mancini<br> trained harder for this fight.<br> And his stamina is amazing.<br> Mancini's father<br> looks pleased.<br> He was a boxer.<br> But he never won<br> the title match.<br> Deuk-gu.<br> Deuk-gu.<br> Can you hear me, Deuk-gu?<br> Let's talk<br> when we get home.<br> There's too many people here.<br> No, I want to tell you now.<br> I'm not dead.<br> I'm here.<br> But why do people<br> keep saying that I'm dead?<br> Mom?<br> It's me.<br> Yeah, I got some sleep.<br> Mom, I have a feeling<br> he'll come today.<br> I had a good dream.<br> I'll see you soon.<br> But he fought so well.<br> Damn, he sure did.<br> Mancini's got a deadly punch.<br> I heard he was hospitalized.<br> What round did he fall?<br> The 14th, I think.<br> He was so young.<br> He died.<br> Deuk-Gu Kim pronounced dead<br> Deuk-Gu Kim pronounced dead<br> Good job, kid.<br> Now let's go home.<br> 13 Years Later<br> Wanna take a look?<br> It's okay.<br> Go on in.<br> I have the courage and will<br> to fight until the end<br> From Deuk-Gu Kim diary<br>
