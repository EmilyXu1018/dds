                        Walter, honey.<br> Time to<br> wake up.<br> Just 10 more minutes.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, sport.<br> You can sleep in tomorrow.<br> That's what<br> Saturdays are for.<br> Up against the wall.<br> Come, come, come.<br> All right.<br> Got it. Got it.<br> Look, look!<br> All right, sit down.<br> Your breakfast<br> is getting cold.<br> It's cereal.<br> It's supposed to be cold.<br> Sweetheart, we're here.<br> Okay.<br> Here's your books.<br> Go ahead.<br> Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment,<br> I'll get a supervisor for you.<br> Yes,<br> she's coming right now.<br> Just a second,<br> she'll be with you.<br> Just one second, please. You deal<br> with this one. I'm not going near it.<br> Hello, this is the supervisor.<br> How can I help you?<br> I can see you're<br> on a party line...<br> Unfortunately, some people do<br> listen in on party lines. We...<br> Well, what is he doing?<br> Oh, my...<br> Everything all right?<br> Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was<br> having trouble with the connection.<br> Hey, sport.<br> - Hey, Mom.<br> How was school?<br> Okay.<br> - Yeah?<br> We learned<br> about dinosaurs.<br> And I got in a fight<br> with Billy Mankowski.<br> What happened?<br> He hit me.<br> Did you hit him back?<br> Good.<br> Rule number one,<br> remember?<br> Never start a fight,<br> always finish it.<br> Why'd he hit you?<br> Because I hit him.<br> You hit him first?<br> Why?<br> He said my dad ran off<br> because he didn't like me.<br> Honey, your father<br> never met you,<br> so how could he<br> not like you?<br> Then why did he leave?<br> Well, because the day<br> you were born,<br> something else<br> arrived in the mail.<br> And it was in a box a<br> little bit bigger than you.<br> You know what was in it?<br> Something called<br> responsibility.<br> And to some people,<br> responsibility is the<br> scariest thing in the world.<br> So, he ran away because he was<br> scared of what was in that box?<br> Uh-huh.<br> That's just dumb.<br> That is exactly<br> what I thought.<br> Did I miss Amos 'N Andy?<br> I'm afraid so, sport.<br> Come now, time for bed.<br> Are we still going<br> to the movies tomorrow?<br> Uh-huh. I hear there's<br> a new Charlie Chaplin picture<br> and a new serial called<br> The Mysterious Airman.<br> Who's that?<br> I don't know.<br> Nobody does.<br> That's what makes him<br> so mysterious.<br> Oh.<br> Am I too heavy<br> for you to carry?<br> Oh, no,<br> not for years.<br> Not for years.<br> Hello?<br> - This is Margaret.<br> Hi, Margaret.<br> So, how are you?<br> Fine.<br> Listen, Jean can't come in today<br> and now we're a little shorthanded.<br> When did she call in sick?<br> About half hour ago.<br> I'm having a hard time<br> trying to find someone.<br> Well, what about Myrna?<br> I know she could use<br> the extra hours and...<br> She's busy.<br> Can't you come?<br> No. No, no, no.<br> I just...<br> I promised Walter that I'd take<br> him to the movies, is all, and...<br> Well, it's just until 4:00.<br> All right.<br> Just...<br> Just until 4:00.<br> I'll see you then.<br> There's a sandwich<br> and milk in the fridge,<br> and I've asked Mrs. Riley<br> and her daughter<br> to stop in<br> in a couple of hours.<br> I can take care of myself.<br> I know you can.<br> They're checking on the house, not you.<br> Tomorrow we will<br> go to the movies.<br> And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa<br> Monica and take a walk on the pier.<br> How does that sound?<br> Does that sound good?<br> I'll be home<br> before it gets dark.<br> I'm not afraid<br> of the dark.<br> I'm not afraid<br> of anything.<br> I know.<br> I know.<br> Be good.<br> I love you.<br> We've got lines jammed<br> from here to Ohio.<br> He says he needs to speak<br> to somebody in charge.<br> I need your signature here<br> for a supply requisition.<br> Number, please.<br> - Number, please.<br> Go ahead, please.<br> All right, get me<br> the Omaha routing station.<br> See if we can put our calls<br> through their switchers.<br> Let's get this<br> console running, now.<br> Christine. Good, I was<br> hoping to catch you.<br> Look, I've been following<br> your work reports,<br> and I just want to let you<br> know that I am very impressed.<br> When I first suggested<br> hiring female supervisors,<br> my superiors weren't<br> big on the idea.<br> But you have held your own as well<br> as any of your male counterparts.<br> Thank you, Mr. Harris.<br> Oh, Ben, please.<br> Listen, I...<br> Listen, the point is,<br> we're looking to take on a manager<br> for our new Beverly Hills office.<br> And if you're interested in the<br> job, I could write a report, or...<br> That would be wonderful.<br> Thank you so much, sir.<br> Okay, good,<br> so maybe we could...<br> Could we speak about it Monday?<br> - Yeah, absolutely.<br> Would that be all right?<br> Thank you so much, sir.

We have an APB out for him,<br> but he's safe.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Oh, Christine...<br> That is so great.<br> Thank you.<br> There's<br> so much press.<br> Yours is a story with a<br> happy ending, Mrs. Collins.<br> People love happy endings.<br> We better get a move on,<br> the train's pulling in.<br> Back, boys. Back.<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks, boys, thanks!<br> I'll have a statement<br> for you in a few minutes,<br> but the important<br> thing right now<br> is to reunite this<br> little lady with her son,<br> so if you'll excuse us.<br> Stay right there.<br> Come on, don't rush.<br> Easy, easy.<br> Mrs. Collins, I'd like to<br> introduce you to James E. Davis,<br> Chief of Police.<br> Very nice to meet you.<br> We don't get a lot<br> of positive attention<br> from the boys in the<br> press these days,<br> so it's good to be here with a<br> positive story, don't you think?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I take it you've been treated<br> well by my boys in the department?<br> I couldn't file a<br> report for 24 hours,<br> and I thought that<br> maybe that was a...<br> Technicalities aside.<br> It was wonderful.<br> Well, good.<br> Then you won't have any trouble<br> telling that to the press,<br> and the fact that the LAPD...<br> Women.<br> Hold on a second.<br> Back, boys, back.<br> Keep them back.<br> Well, aren't you...<br> Aren't you gonna...<br> That's not my son.<br> What?<br> What are you saying?<br> It's not my son.<br> Well, I'm sure<br> you're mistaken.<br> I'm not mistaken.<br> Well, he's been through<br> five terrible long months.<br> He's lost weight,<br> he's changed.<br> I would know my own son.<br> All I'm saying is you're<br> in shock and he's changed.<br> What's your name?<br> Can you tell me your name?<br> Walter Collins.<br> It's a common name.<br> Where do you live, Walter?<br> You know your home address?<br> I live at 210 Avenue 23,<br> Los Angeles, California.<br> And that's my mommy!<br> Mrs. Collins, listen<br> to me. I understand.<br> You're feeling a little uncertain<br> right now, and that's to be expected.<br> A boy this age,<br> he changes so fast.<br> We've compensated for that<br> in our investigation.<br> And there's no question<br> that this is your son.<br> That is not Walter.<br> It's not Walter<br> as you remember him.<br> And that's why it's important for<br> you to take him home on a trial basis.<br> A trial basis?<br> Yes, yes.<br> Once he's around his<br> familiar surroundings,<br> and you've given yourself time to recover<br> from the shock of his changed condition,<br> you will see that<br> this is your Walter.<br> Now, I promise you, I swear<br> to you, I give you my word.<br> This is your son.<br> Now, if you have any problems, any problems<br> at all, you come and you talk to me.<br> I'll take care of it.<br> I give you my word.<br> Trust me.<br> Mrs. Collins, he has<br> nowhere else to go.<br> Please.<br> Maybe I'm not<br> thinking clearly.<br> And...<br> All right.<br> All right, you're not<br> thinking clearly, that's right.<br> Here we go!<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Here, just turn<br> around here.<br> How does it feel to have<br> your son home, Mrs. Collins?<br> What'd you think when you<br> saw him for the first time?<br> It's hard to explain.<br> She was<br> shocked at first.<br> She didn't recognize the boy,<br> which is perfectly natural.<br> He's been through<br> quite an ordeal.<br> How're you feeling, son?<br> Bet it feels great<br> to be home.<br> Yeah. It's great.<br> The Los Angeles<br> Police Department is thankful<br> for all the hard work done by the<br> DeKalb County Sheriff's Department<br> in making this joyful<br> reunion possible.<br> The LAPD is dedicated to<br> serving the public at all times.<br> Can we get a photo with<br> mother and son, Captain?<br> Absolutely! Here we are.<br> Like that.<br> Like that.<br> Squeeze together.<br> There you go, boys.<br> This way, Walter.<br> - Big smile.<br> One more, please.<br> - That's a good one.<br> One more.<br> The sandwich all right?<br> Would you like<br> some more milk?<br> No.<br> No, thank you.<br> No, thank you.<br> You're covered in soot from the<br> train. You should take a bath.<br> Pajamas are on the<br> edge of the bed.<br> You okay?<br> You all right?<br> I fell. Stupid tub!<br> That's all right.<br> You're circumcised.<br> Get out.<br> Move.<br> Last time<br> I measured Walter,<br> last time<br> I measured my son,<br> he was inches taller<br> than you are now.<br> Who are you?<br> What are you doing here?<br> Who are you?<br> Who are you?<br> He's not my son.<br> Mrs. Collins...<br> No, I don't know why<br> he's saying that he is,<br> but he's not Walter<br> and there's been a mistake.<br> I thought we agreed to<br> give him time to adjust.<br> He's three inches shorter.<br> I measured him<br> on the chart.<br> Well, maybe your<br> measurements are off.<br> Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable<br> explanation for all of this.<br> He's circumcised.<br> And Walter isn't.<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> Your son was missing<br> for five months.<br> For at least part of that time in the<br> company of an as yet unidentified drifter.<br> Who knows what such a disturbed<br> individual might have done?<br> He could have had him circumcised.<br> He could have...<br> Made him shorter?<br> Why aren't you<br> listening to me?<br> I am listening, damn it,<br> I am listening.<br> And I understand<br> your feelings.<br> He's changed, no<br> mistake, and that's...<br> You've both been through<br> a terrible experience,<br> and that's why he needs your<br> love and support to bounce back.<br> He's not my son!<br> Why are you doing this,<br> Mrs. Collins?<br> Why are you doing this?<br> You seem perfectly capable<br> of taking care of the boy.<br> Your job pays you enough to<br> attend to his personal needs,<br> so I don't understand<br> why you're running away<br> from your responsibilities<br> as a mother.<br> I am not running away<br> from anything!<br> Least of all<br> my responsibilities!<br> I am even taking care<br> of that boy right now,<br> because I am all he has!<br> What worries me is that you<br> have stopped looking for my son!<br> Why should we be looking for<br> someone we've already found?<br> Because you have<br> not found him.<br> His identity<br> has been confirmed<br> by the best minds in the<br> field of child identification,<br> people who know<br> what they're doing.<br> And I don't?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I appreciate everything that<br> this department has done<br> and I know<br> how hard you're working.<br> I really do, and I don't<br> want to cause any trouble.<br> I just...<br> There has been a terrible mistake,<br> and I need you to<br> help me correct it,<br> so I can find my son<br> before it's too late.<br> Please.<br> I won't take up any more of your time.<br> I'm sorry I got upset.<br> I'm sorry, very sorry.<br> Yes, Captain?<br> Sara, get Dr. Tarr<br> on the phone.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Mrs. Collins?<br> - Yes?<br> Dr. Earl W. Tarr.<br> Captain Jones sent me.<br> I consult with him from time<br> to time on juvenile cases.<br> May I come in?<br> Yes, thank you for coming.<br> I was beginning to think<br> he didn't believe me.<br> Well, I'm here now,<br> and we'll put all that to rights.<br> Where's the boy?<br> Ah! There he is.<br> A handsome young man.<br> He has your eyes,<br> doesn't he?<br> And a little bit<br> of the nose.<br> Very fit, in spite<br> of all his travails.<br> A very resilient boy you've<br> got here, Mrs. Collins.<br> I thought you were<br> here to help me.<br> Well, I am.<br> Captain Jones said that the boy had<br> been through some severe physical changes<br> and asked me<br> to drop in on him<br> to reassure you in your<br> time of motherly concern.<br> My motherly concern is not for<br> him because he's not my son.<br> Now, statements like that will<br> hardly help the boy's self-esteem,<br> now will they?<br> Captain Jones said something<br> about a change in height?<br> Yes.<br> Come.<br> Against the wall.<br> He's three inches shorter.<br> Ah, well...<br> Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.<br> We've known for some time that trauma<br> can affect the growth of children.<br> Given the stress<br> of the past five months,<br> his spine may have<br> actually shrunk.<br> It's uncommon, but it's within<br> the realm of possibility.<br> And circumcision?<br> Very likely his abductor<br> thought it appropriate.<br> After all, circumcision<br> is hygienically sound.<br> Must have been quite<br> traumatic at the time.<br> No wonder<br> he's submerged the memory.<br> I...<br> You see, there's a perfectly sound<br> medical explanation for all of this.<br> But it's right for you<br> to raise the questions.<br> You need to be apprised of all<br> changes the lad went through<br> during his absence.<br> Wouldn't I know whether<br> or not he's my son?<br> I'm the mother.<br> Which means you're in no<br> position to be objective.<br> You are looking through the<br> prism of extreme emotion at a boy<br> who has changed<br> from what you remember.<br> He isn't the same boy<br> that left here.<br> Just as a boy that goes<br> off to war and then returns<br> is not the same anymore.<br> And a mother's heart, driven<br> by intuition and emotion,<br> sees these changes<br> and rebels,<br> insists that<br> this isn't your son.<br> Doesn't change the facts.<br> I'm willing to put my theory to the<br> test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.<br> Are you?<br> It is absolutely outrageous!<br> Calm yourself, calm yourself<br> and just listen to me.<br> No, no, no.<br> No, you listen to me, please.<br> This so called doctor paraded<br> me around my own neighborhood,<br> like some kind of a derelict mother<br> who didn't even know her own son.<br> And what was his findings?<br> He found what he<br> expected to find,<br> what you obviously<br> told him he would find.<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> - But that's not...<br> That's nothing<br> to be embarrassed about.<br> That I was embarrassed<br> is not the issue.<br> The point is that<br> you are wasting time<br> when you should be<br> looking for my son.<br> But the report is final,<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> Well, then I want to receive<br> the report, so I can refute it,<br> before it goes<br> to anyone else.<br> Fine.<br> Yes. Good day.<br> I'm finished. Could I<br> go to my room now?<br> Yes.<br> Good night, Mommy.<br> Stop saying that!<br> Stop saying that!<br> I'm not your mother!<br> I want my son back.<br> You're not him.<br> You're not my son!<br> I want my son back.<br> I want my son back!<br> Damn you!<br> I want my son back!<br> I was wrong<br> to yell at you.<br> You're just a child<br> and I don't think you know<br> what you're doing,<br> and the hurt<br> you're causing.<br> But I need you to understand<br> that my son is my life.<br> He's all I have.<br> And no matter what the police think,<br> and no matter what the world thinks,<br> you and I,<br> we both know the truth,<br> don't we?<br> We both know that<br> you're not Walter.<br> You just have to tell them<br> that you're not my son,<br> so they can find my son.<br> Please.<br> We can talk tomorrow.<br> Hello?<br> Is this Mrs. Christine Collins?<br> Yes.<br> My name is Gustav Briegleb.<br> I'm the pastor over at<br> St. Paul's Presbyterian.<br> Oh, yes, I've heard<br> your broadcasts.<br> I'm...<br> Thank you.<br> Have you read<br> the Times this morning?<br> No.<br> Well, maybe you should give it a gander<br> and then come over here to the parish<br> for breakfast, in, say, an hour.<br> I think we should meet.<br> Hello?<br> "Mysterious case of...<br> "Acting on the request of the<br> Los Angeles Police Department,<br> "Dr. Earl W.

No.<br> The LAPD wanted to<br> wipe out the competition.<br> Mayor Cryer and half<br> the force are on the take.<br> Gambling, prostitution,<br> bootlegging, you name it.<br> Because once you give people the<br> freedom to do whatever they want,<br> as the Lord found in the Garden<br> of Eden, they will do exactly that.<br> This police department does not<br> tolerate dissent, or contradiction,<br> or even embarrassment.<br> And you are in a position to<br> embarrass them and they do not like it.<br> They will do anything in<br> their power to discredit you.<br> I've seen that happen too many<br> times to start going blind now.<br> That's why I wanted<br> to meet you,<br> to let you know what<br> you're getting yourself into<br> and to help you fight it,<br> if you choose to.<br> Reverend, I appreciate<br> everything that you're doing<br> and everything<br> that you said,<br> but I'm not on a mission.<br> I just want my son home.<br> Mrs. Collins, a lot<br> of mothers' sons<br> have been sacrificed<br> to expediency around here.<br> Your son, unfortunately,<br> would not be the first.<br> But if you do it right,<br> he may very well be the last.<br> He had two cavities<br> that needed filling.<br> He put up a fight,<br> but I took care of it.<br> And?<br> Your son's upper front teeth were<br> separated by a small tissue, a diastema.<br> It made them sit about<br> an eighth of an inch apart.<br> The boy in that room<br> has no such gap.<br> Can that change with age?

My name is<br> Christine Collins.<br> Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> On March 10th, my nine-year-old<br> son, Walter Collins, disappeared.<br> And a five-month investigation<br> led to a boy being brought to<br> Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.<br> They told me and all of you<br> that this boy was my son.<br> He was not my son.<br> The LAPD made a mistake,<br> and that is the reason for<br> the supposed transformation.<br> I have letters from his<br> teachers and his doctors<br> all confirming that<br> he is not my son.<br> I'm having them reprinted now, and<br> I'll have them for you tomorrow.<br> I have given the LAPD every<br> opportunity to admit their mistake<br> and renew the<br> search for my son.<br> Since they have<br> refused to do so,<br> it has forced me<br> to bring my case public.<br> And I hope that this now will persuade<br> them to finish what they started<br> and bring my son home to me.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Morelli!<br> I want you to find the<br> Collins woman and get her here.<br> And, Bill, bring her<br> in the back way.<br> Yes, sir.<br> This way, miss.<br> Why are we going<br> in the back?<br> Captain's orders. Front's<br> jammed with reporters.<br> Please, sit down, miss. Captain<br> Jones'll be right with you.<br> Hey! Anyone want to take a call<br> from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?<br> What'd they do,<br> lose a moose?<br> They need a juvenile living here<br> illegally deported back to Canada.<br> He's living with his cousin on some<br> ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.<br> You want it?<br> - I'll take it.<br> Got nothing better to do.<br> You're a prince.<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> You can leave the boy.<br> She'll take care of him.<br> Sit.<br> Oh, you've caused us quite a<br> bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.<br> This situation has become an embarrassment<br> for the entire police department.<br> It wasn't my intention<br> to embarrass anyone.<br> Oh, no, of course not.<br> You just told the papers we couldn't<br> tell one boy from another as a compliment<br> for the months we spent<br> working on your case.<br> You trying to make fools out of<br> us? Is that it? You enjoy this?<br> Of course not.<br> I want you to find my son.<br> You know what your<br> problem is, Mrs. Collins?<br> You're trying to shirk your<br> responsibilities as a mother.<br> What?<br> You enjoyed being a<br> free woman, didn't you?<br> You enjoyed not having to<br> worry about a young son.<br> You could go where you<br> wanted, do whatever you wanted,<br> see anyone you wanted.<br> But then we found your son,<br> and we brought him back.<br> And now he's an<br> inconvenience to you.<br> And that's why you<br> cooked up this scheme,<br> to throw him to the state and get<br> the state to raise him for you.<br> Isn't that true?<br> - That is not true!<br> No? Well, even the boy<br> says he's your son.<br> Why would he say that?<br> How would he know<br> to do that?<br> I don't know.<br> I just know he's lying.<br> Oh, maybe so.<br> Maybe he is a liar.<br> But that's how he's<br> been trained, isn't it?<br> Lying was born<br> in both of you.<br> You're a liar and a<br> troublemaker and, if you ask me,<br> you got no business walking<br> the streets of Los Angeles.<br> Now wait a minute.<br> Because either<br> you know you're lying,<br> or you're not capable of knowing if<br> you're lying or telling the truth.<br> So, which is it?<br> You a derelict mother?<br> Or just plain nuts?<br> 'Cause from where I sit,<br> those are the only options.<br> I'm not gonna sit<br> here and take this.<br> You want experts? You want doctors?<br> I have a few of my own.<br> Matron.<br> Mrs. Collins, you still insist that<br> the boy out there is not your son?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Please, don't struggle.<br> - What?<br> No!<br> - You'll only hurt yourself.<br> What are you doing?<br> - Hold still.<br> You can't just do this.<br> No, you can't.<br> You are to convey the prisoner<br> to the Los Angeles County General<br> Hospital Psychopathic Ward.<br> What?<br> You are to make<br> the following entry.<br> Defendant states she's been<br> deceived by police and others,<br> and that we have given<br> her a boy and tried<br> to make her think it is her<br> son when she says it is not.<br> Take her away.<br> - No. No, no.<br> Please. Please.<br> Come on, Mrs. Collins.<br> No. No.<br> This way.<br> Mrs. Collins has been known<br> to us since about March 10th, 1928<br> when she reported her<br> nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.<br> The boy was gone until August 1928.<br> - Okay.<br> Since his return,<br> she has complained that he is still missing<br> and has made repeated<br> requests that he be found.<br> She suffers from paranoia, delusions of<br> persecution and dislocation from reality.<br> She may be a threat<br> to herself or others.<br> We recommend that she be<br> conveyed to the psychopathic ward<br> until her senses<br> can be restored.<br> Got another code 12.<br> Name?<br> Collins. Christine.<br> No, no, no, listen,<br> this is a mistake.<br> Certifying officer?<br> Captain J.J. Jones,<br> Lincoln Heights Division.<br> No, no, please!<br> Please! The police are trying to punish me...<br> If you keep it up, I'm gonna<br> have to put you in a straitjacket.<br> Do you want that?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Then behave yourself.<br> Code 12.<br> I'm not mad!<br> Please.<br> Oh, God.<br> All right.<br> No!<br> Stop!<br> Spread your legs.<br> What?<br> Wider.<br> Oh.<br> I'm not sick!<br> Touch me! Touch me!<br> Inside. This is your room.<br> The doctor has left for the day.<br> He will see you in the morning.<br> Can I... I need to speak<br> to somebody in authority.<br> Sorry.<br> My room!<br> No. No, no, no, this is my room.<br> Can I make<br> a phone call?<br> Phone privileges are<br> earned by good behavior.<br> You're not allowed newspapers,<br> magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.<br> This is for your own good.<br> - Help me!<br> Listen to me.<br> My room.<br> No,<br> this is my room.<br> Oh, God!<br> My room.<br> No, no,<br> this is my room.<br> My room.<br> My room! My room!<br> My room!<br> My room!<br> They said it was my room!<br> You have a problem?<br> Overheated, that's all.<br> She'll be fine in a bit.<br> Hey, listen, could<br> you give me a hand?<br> I'm trying to find a place called<br> the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.<br> Northcott Ranch, huh?<br> Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> You're almost there.<br> You just... You just<br> follow this road west,<br> about two, no, three miles.<br> And then you take<br> that next right.<br> And you stay on that and it<br> will bring you right to it.<br> Is something going<br> on out there?<br> No.<br> Just looking into<br> a juvenile matter.<br> Thanks for your help.<br> Sure.<br> Hello?<br> Hey!<br> Hey! Hey!<br> Come here!<br> Come here!<br> This is the police!<br> I have a warrant for a<br> minor named Sanford Clark.<br> Open the door<br> or stand aside.<br> Hey! Stop!<br> Stop! Stop it!

I know<br> it's hard, but you gotta try.<br> Oh, boy.<br> I heard them talking.<br> You're here on code 12?<br> Police action.<br> I mean, the doctors,<br> the staff, they figure<br> that if the police<br> brought you here,<br> there must be<br> a good reason for it.<br> There isn't a good<br> reason for it.<br> I'm perfectly sane and I<br> will explain that to them.<br> How?<br> The more you try to act sane,<br> the crazier you start to look.<br> If you smile too much, you're<br> delusional or you're stifling hysteria.<br> And if you don't smile,<br> you're depressed.<br> If you remain neutral, you're emotionally<br> withdrawn, potentially catatonic.<br> You've given this<br> a lot of thought.<br> Yeah, I have.<br> Don't you get it?<br> You're a code 12,<br> so am I.<br> We're here for the<br> exact same reasons.<br> We both pissed<br> off the cops.<br> Now, you see, you<br> see that lady there?<br> She was married to a cop<br> who kept beating her up.<br> When she tried to tell somebody<br> about it, he brought her here.<br> I want more juice.<br> And that one?<br> Put your tray<br> back where it belongs.<br> The police beat the crap out of<br> her brother, broke both his arms.<br> When she tried to<br> tell the papers...<br> And you?<br> I work nights.<br> Sure.<br> I mean, I work nights.<br> Oh.<br> Yeah. In the clubs.<br> Downtown.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Yeah, well, this one client just<br> kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,<br> so I filed a complaint.<br> And it turns out<br> he was a cop.<br> Next thing I know,<br> I'm here.<br> But they can't do that.<br> Are you kidding?<br> All right, one<br> more and then that's it.<br> Everybody knows<br> women are fragile.<br> I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,<br> there's nothing going on upstairs.<br> Somebody! Help me!<br> Every once in a while they say<br> something that's a little inconvenient,<br> they just go fucking nuts.<br> Pardon my French.<br> You gotta get those dishes.<br> - You got it.<br> If we're insane, nobody<br> has to listen to us.<br> I mean, who are<br> you gonna believe,<br> some crazy woman trying to<br> destroy the integrity of the force,<br> or a police officer?<br> Then once they get us in here, we<br> either shut up and we learn to behave,<br> or we don't go home.<br> Are you all done?<br> Or we go home like that.<br> Stop. Stop it.<br> Stop it!<br> Stop it.<br> Please.<br> Clark.<br> Sanford Clark?<br> Here.<br> Paperwork's come through.<br> You'll be deported back to<br> Canada day after tomorrow.<br> Police there will decide<br> what to do with you next.<br> I hope your stay here has convinced<br> you not to try crossing the border<br> illegally in the future.<br> Wait!<br> I'd like to talk to the<br> officer who brought me in.<br> I'm sure he has far<br> more important things...<br> Please. It's important.<br> Christine Collins.<br> Thank you. Mrs. Collins.<br> Dr. Jonathan Steele.<br> Please, have a seat.<br> I hope your stay with us<br> has been comfortable so far.<br> Yes.<br> Really?<br> I'd think it'd<br> be quite difficult at first.<br> Yes, it was.<br> Of course it was very difficult,<br> but comfortable enough.<br> I see that they have...<br> They've taken a blood test.<br> The Wassermman Test.<br> They said it was to check for<br> syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.<br> The idea that someone thinks you<br> need to be checked for syphilis,<br> does that upset you?<br> No, they said it was standard<br> procedure, so it did not.<br> Yes, exactly.<br> Standard procedure.<br> We have to cover<br> all our bases.<br> I can imagine<br> that for some people that<br> would be uncomfortable,<br> but I understood.<br> According to your file you<br> believe that the police substituted<br> a fake boy for your son.<br> No, I didn't say<br> he was a fake boy.<br> He's not my boy.<br> They brought home<br> the wrong boy.<br> My son is still missing.<br> Well, that's strange, because<br> I have here a newspaper article<br> with a photo of you at the train<br> station, welcoming home your son.<br> That is you in the<br> photo, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Yeah.<br> Yes.<br> So, at first<br> he was your son,<br> and now he's not your son.<br> Has this<br> been going on for a long time?<br> People changing, becoming<br> something other than what they are?<br> People don't change.<br> You don't think<br> people change?<br> No, that's not...<br> The police, they're not<br> out to persecute you?<br> No, they're not.<br> No, they're not.<br> The police are here<br> to protect you.<br> Yes.<br> Really?<br> Yes.<br> Well, that's odd because<br> when you were admitted,<br> you told the head nurse that the police<br> were conspiring deliberately to punish you.<br> So, either the head nurse and the<br> interns are also conspiring to punish you<br> or you're changing<br> your story.<br> Do you often have trouble telling<br> reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?<br> No.<br> I'm sorry to bring you out<br> in this weather, Detective,<br> but the boy has<br> been quite insistent.<br> It's all right.<br> I'll see what he has to say<br> so I can go home and get dry.<br> It's raining cats, dogs,<br> and Democrats out there,<br> so this had better<br> be worth it.<br> You again, huh?<br> We'll see.<br> Well?<br> This isn't easy, okay?<br> Yeah?<br> Driving my ass here in the<br> pouring rain wasn't easy either.<br> My cousin is<br> Gordon Northcott.<br> He owns the ranch<br> where you found me.<br> He said I could live there in exchange<br> I watch the place when he's gone,<br> doing chores<br> and stuff like that.<br> Said I could stay as<br> long as I wanted to.<br> I thought that meant I could<br> leave whenever I wanted.<br> Mmm.<br> You saying that he<br> held you prisoner?<br> Bull.<br> When I got there, you were<br> running around free as a jaybird.<br> Could've left any<br> time you wanted.<br> No.<br> So, what's this, huh?<br> Some kind of story to cover why<br> you're in the country illegally?<br> No, it's nothing like that.<br> 'Cause I don't have<br> time for this, okay?<br> Listen to me!<br> He said...<br> What?<br> What did he say?<br> He said that if I tried<br> to leave, he'd kill me.<br> Look, you don't understand<br> what he's like,<br> what he... What we did,<br> what he made me do.<br> All right.<br> Let's start at<br> the beginning then.<br> What'd he make you do?<br> We killed some kids.<br> What?<br> Look, I didn't mean to, I swear.<br> He made me help him.<br> He said if I didn't,<br> he'd kill me, too.<br> Look, you gotta help me,<br> please. I'm so scared.<br> I don't want to go<br> to hell for killing kids.<br> Look.<br> What kids? What... What<br> are you talking about?<br> I don't know.<br> I never knew their names.<br> Names?<br> How many?<br> How many kids?<br> All together?<br> About 20, I guess.<br> No, you're lying.<br> No! It's true, I swear!<br> You're gonna tell me<br> you killed 20 kids?<br> Yeah! Thereabouts.<br> I stopped counting<br> after a while.<br> Gordon said maybe one<br> or two may have escaped.<br> But...<br> No.<br> Nobody can just up<br> and kill 20 kids, okay?<br> We did.<br> We did.<br> How?<br> Most times we'd just<br> have one or two.<br> Sometimes as many as three.<br> I always knew when we<br> were getting ready to leave.<br> Clean up the car.<br> Make sure the tires<br> were good.<br> Check the engine.<br> 'Cause he was afraid that<br> the car would break down<br> and we'd get caught.<br> My loving baby<br> We'd always go a different<br> direction every time.<br> Never hit the same<br> part of town twice.<br> Sometimes we'd just<br> drive around for hours,<br> till we found somebody.<br> Well, there you are!<br> We've been looking<br> for you like mad.<br> You have?<br> Sure thing.<br> Listen, your folks,<br> they've been in an accident.<br> And they sent us to come find<br> you. Now, they're hurt real bad.<br> The police took them to the hospital, but<br> they didn't have time to come find you,<br> so we said that<br> we would do it.<br> Now, come on.<br> All right.<br> Get in here. Hurry.<br> Listen, we gotta get you to that<br> hospital so you can see your folks.<br> See, a lot of kids won't<br> get in a car alone with a stranger,<br> but when he's got<br> a kid there...<br> There's a good boy.<br> Scoot over.<br> Scoot over, San.<br> ... that made it easier.<br> I want you to hold on tight.<br> They'd look<br> at me and say...<br> We've got a long way to go.<br> "Hey, if he's safe..."<br> And we are gonna fly.<br> "...I guess<br> I will be, too. "<br> Every time they got<br> in the truck,<br> I just wanted to die.<br> As soon as we got back to the<br> ranch, they went in the coop.<br> You boys hungry?<br> Huh?<br> Watch the door, Sanford!<br> Hey! Watch the door!<br> What's the matter?<br> I'm not gonna hurt you.<br> Are you worried that<br> I'm gonna hurt you?<br> I'm not gonna hurt you.<br> Huh? Come here.<br> No! No! No! No! Please!<br> - I would never hurt you.<br> Some days<br> he'd do them right off.<br> Other days he'd wait,<br> pick up a few more,<br> until he had about<br> four or five of them.<br> Yeah.<br> No! No! No!<br> - No what?<br> No what, huh?<br> Come on. Come on. Come on!<br> Sanford, keep your<br> eye on that door!<br> No! Please, no! No! No!<br> No! No! No! No!<br> Please! No! No!<br> He'd... He'd<br> sometimes leave<br> just one or two of them<br> alive, barely, anyway.<br> He'd say,<br> "Finish them, San.<br> "Finish them or... Finish<br> them or I'll finish you."<br> And I did.<br> And I killed them.<br> And I did.<br> I killed them.<br> Oh, God, I killed them!<br> Oh, God! Oh!<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> What?<br> Look at me.<br> These kids.<br> You think if you saw them again, you<br> think you might be able to recognize them?<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe.<br> Hey, I haven't updated<br> these in a while, but still.<br> Just...<br> It should be. Just go<br> through these, okay?<br> If you see any you recognize, just<br> put them down on the table here.<br> I'm sorry!<br> Oh, my God.<br> I didn't mean to...<br> He made me.<br> Oh, shit.<br> This one. Look at me.<br> You're sure?<br> I'm sure.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Oh, God!<br> Oh, God!<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Son of a bitch.<br> Oh, God.<br> Well, he's lying.<br> Have you gone soft<br> in the head, Les?<br> Twenty kids, sir.<br> He's playing you.<br> He knows he's in trouble, so he's<br> come up with some cock and bull story<br> about how he was forced<br> to stay in the country.<br> With all due respect, sir, I<br> don't think so. You didn't see him.<br> This kid, he's scared<br> half out of his mind.<br> He picked the Collins kid.<br> We found him, remember?<br> Haven't you been<br> reading the papers?<br> Or maybe you have,<br> is that it?<br> Sir, if you'd just<br> listen to me...<br> I'm sorry, Captain,<br> but he's here again.<br> Who?<br> - That Reverend Briegleb.<br> He's asking about<br> Christine Collins.<br> Well, you tell that<br> son of a bitch<br> to get the hell off<br> of police property,<br> or I'll have him arrested<br> for disturbing the peace.<br> I tried. He said he won't<br> leave, him or his friends.<br> What?<br> Oh, what the hell!<br> Jesus!<br> Oh, Jesus jumped down.<br> Captain?<br> Ybarra?<br> - Yeah.<br> Listen to me. You're to do<br> nothing except get back here.<br> Sir, departmental<br> policy requires that<br> all allegations of homicide<br> have to be investigated.<br> These are kids,<br> for Christ sake.<br> Departmental policy<br> is what I say it is.<br> Now, I'm ordering you to get your ass<br> back here with that kid, you got that?<br> You don't talk to anybody and<br> you bring me that kid. You got it?<br> Nobody!<br> Captain Jones.<br> - Boys.<br> What the hell have you done<br> with Christine Collins?<br> And don't try and lie<br> your way out of it,<br> because several of her neighbors saw<br> her being driven away in a police car.<br> Mrs. Collins has been placed<br> in protective custody<br> following a mental breakdown.<br> A what?<br> She's getting the best<br> treatment available.<br> And that will be all.<br> Next.<br> Go on. Move up.<br> - For what?<br> Medication.<br> Medication for what?<br> - The kind that's good for you.<br> Help you relax.<br> Well, I don't want to relax.<br> - Come on.<br> I'm not gonna take something...<br> - We can force-feed you<br> if that's what you want.<br> - I don't know what it is!<br> I don't know what it is. Dr. Steele?<br> - Take it. Orderly.<br> Dr. Steele?<br> I understand. Come on.<br> Ladies, keep moving.<br> Come on.<br> I don't wanna take anything<br> that I don't know what it is.<br> There's nothing wrong with<br> me that I need medication.<br> There's nothing<br> wrong with you.<br> No, there's nothing wrong.<br> No.<br> You're fine.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> Well, then you shouldn't<br> have any trouble signing this.<br> By signing it, you certify<br> that you were wrong<br> when you stated the boy returned to<br> you by the police was not your son.<br> It further stipulates<br> that the police were right<br> in sending you here for<br> observation and it absolves them<br> of all responsibility.<br> Sign it.<br> I won't sign that.<br> I won't sign that.<br> Well, then your condition<br> is not improved.<br> Sign it, and you can be out of<br> here first thing tomorrow morning.<br> But I wasn't wrong.<br> He's not my son.<br> My son is still missing.<br> Mrs. Collins,<br> you're becoming agitated.<br> Yes, I'm, yes... I'm not signing<br> that, because he's not my son!<br> Orderly!<br> He's not my son!<br> - Orderly!<br> My son is missing!<br> The patient is becoming hysterical!<br> - No! My son is missing!<br> See to it she is<br> sedated properly.<br> Get her out of here.<br> - No! No! No!<br> Next!<br> - No!<br> No, no!<br> - Orderly, hold on.<br> Stop it!<br> No!<br> - Open your mouth. Open, open your mouth.<br> Easy!<br> - You got her?<br> God!<br> - Swallow it.<br> Stop it!<br> Move back.<br> You!<br> - Get her out of here!<br> Come on, you got her?<br> Stay out of this! This is none of<br> your business! This is police business!<br> All of you! You'll stay out of it<br> if you know what's good for you!<br> You'd think you were in enough<br> trouble with the law already,<br> being a whore,<br> wouldn't you?<br> Attacking a staff member.<br> Room 18.<br> No, no! Stop it! No!<br> No! No!<br> No! Stop it!<br> Come on, kid.<br> I don't know. I'm not sure.<br> I think so. He was pretty close.<br> Excuse me.<br> It's all right, I can take it from here.<br> - But I got...<br> We need him<br> for questioning.<br> Like I said, it was dark.<br> Thanks. Come on.<br> Brady, Ross.<br> You've just been requisitioned for<br> backup. I'll explain on the way.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm not sure. She said she'd had<br> the croup before. This could be pneumonia.<br> I keep telling her<br> that, and she doesn't want to.<br> You have to insist.<br> You shouldn't<br> have done that.<br> Please, let me out!<br> - Get in there!<br> Wanted to.<br> Felt good.<br> Let me out! No! Please! No!<br> - You got her?<br> I lost two babies<br> to back alley doctors.<br> No choice.<br> Never had the chance<br> to fight for them.<br> You do.<br> Don't stop.<br> I won't.<br> Fuck them and the horse<br> they rode in on.<br> That's not exactly<br> language for a lady.<br> Hell.<br> There are times that's exactly<br> the right language to use.<br> Yeah?<br> When you've got<br> nothing left to lose.<br> You're not supposed<br> to be here!<br> Mmm. Mmm.<br> Stay there. Check the<br> house. Check the barn.<br> It's all clear.<br> Clear here.<br> Bring me that shovel.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> Come on.<br> You're gonna show me.<br> Come on. Show me.<br> This it?<br> You sure?<br> Yeah.<br> Dig.<br> You put them in the ground, you<br> can take them out of the ground.<br> Go on. Dig.<br> You heard me. Dig.<br> My God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Call it in.<br> Get the coroner<br> and every officer<br> in a 20-mile radius here<br> inside the hour.<br> Then put out an APB on<br> Gordon Stewart Northcott.<br> The information's<br> in my car. Go on.<br> You can stop, son.<br> You can stop now.<br> It's over.<br> Hey.<br> We'll take it, we can take it<br> from here. We can take it from...<br> We can take it from<br> here, okay? It's over.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay. It's okay.<br> It's all over.<br> Okay?<br> File.<br> Privacy, please.<br> I see that you've been refusing<br> medication, requiring force feeding.<br> All right, Michael.<br> Lunchtime?<br> Six days, Mrs. Collins,<br> and no progress.<br> We may have to move on to<br> more strenuous therapies.<br> Unless you're willing to<br> prove that you're doing better<br> by signing this.<br> Fuck you and the horse<br> you rode in on.<br> Room 18.<br> I want to talk to somebody<br> in charge, right now!<br> Please.<br> Who is in charge here?<br> Open.<br> I'm the head doctor on duty.<br> You're the doctor who<br> locked up Christine Collins?<br> Oh, I'm sorry, sir.<br> We don't discuss cases with<br> anyone other than family.<br> Oh, you'll damn well<br> discuss this one. Read it.<br> Sir.<br> Read it.<br> Stop.<br> Mrs. Collins,<br> one last time.<br> Are you or are you not<br> prepared to sign that letter?<br> No.<br> You're free to leave.<br> What?<br> Your clothes are in the next<br> room. You can change there.<br> In the next room?<br> Yes. That's right.<br> See to it.<br> Christ.<br> Long as it's not the original.<br> No, it's not.<br> Here it is.<br> And who is that? Is<br> that Baker's file or Larson?<br> That's Baker.<br> He said he wanted...<br> Nurse, I wanna see<br> every piece of paper you have on<br> the case of Mrs. Christine Collins,<br> and I want to see it right<br> now, do you understand me?<br> Every piece. When<br> will she be coming out?<br> Oh, it's just up ahead.<br> Oh, all right.<br> Let's...<br> Hurricane hits<br> West Palm Beach!<br> Babe Ruth hits<br> Kids found murdered in Riverside!<br> - There it is.<br> Biggest crime<br> in Los Angeles history!<br> Collins boy assumed dead!<br> Read it here!<br> Read it here!<br> Mrs. Collins,<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Captain, your handling of<br> the Christine Collins case<br> has exposed this department<br> to public ridicule.<br> There is even the possibility<br> of civil and criminal liability.<br> Sir, nobody could've known what<br> was happening up at that ranch.<br> Not us, the sheriff's department,<br> or the marshal's office.<br> And as for the<br> Collins woman,<br> I'm still not convinced that her boy<br> is among the victims up in Wineville.<br> No?<br> No.<br> There were four other photos of<br> missing boys that looked a lot like him.<br> The Clark kid<br> could've been mistaken.<br> Maybe he was.<br> Which begs the obvious<br> question. Who cares?<br> Sir?<br> The mayor wants<br> this to go away.<br> I want this to go away.<br> The way you do that is to stop<br> insisting that Walter Collins<br> is not among those boys killed<br> up at that goddamn ranch.<br> Because if the boy you brought<br> back is not Walter Collins,<br> and he's not dead up at that<br> ranch, then where the hell is he?<br> People are gonna want to<br> know why we haven't found him.<br> Why we're not<br> doing our job.<br> But if, on the other hand,<br> he is, or could be, among those<br> poor boys killed up in Wineville,<br> then the inquiries stop.<br> It's a momentary<br> embarrassment<br> you're just gonna<br> have to live with.<br> Better a short<br> inconvenience<br> than a lingering problem,<br> wouldn't you say, Captain?<br> Yes, sir.<br> The boy's been gone<br> nearly a year.<br> If he was going to be found,<br> it would've happened by now.<br> Whether he was up<br> at that ranch or not,<br> the truth is he probably<br> is dead somewhere.<br> Better his mother accept that<br> now than later, don't you think?<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Good.<br> That'll be all, Captain.<br> That's how you want it,<br> then I guess we're done here.<br> Tell county jail we're<br> remanding him for trial.<br> Wait. I didn't do anything. I<br> wasn't even here when it happened.<br> By pretending to<br> be Walter Collins,<br> you're interfering in a police<br> investigation of a kidnapping and murder.<br> We can try you as accomplice<br> to that murder after the fact.<br> That's too bad.<br> County jail is a lot worse than<br> a juvenile hall or a foster home.<br> It's a lot worse.<br> You can't do that.<br> I'm just a kid.<br> Sanford Clark's a kid, too.<br> Fifteen.<br> He's going to jail.<br> All murderers and their accomplices<br> go to jail. Everybody knows that.<br> Get him out of here.<br> It's out of my hands now.<br> Wait. I don't<br> want to go to jail.<br> Prove it.<br> I...<br> I knew Los Angeles is where<br> they make the Tom Mix movies.<br> I figured<br> if I could meet Tom Mix<br> maybe he would let me<br> ride on his horse.<br> His horse is named Tony.<br> Did you know that?<br> How are you feeling?<br> All right.<br> The police still<br> have a car outside.<br> I guess they're waiting to see<br> what your next move is going to be.<br> I'm going home.<br> - And then?<br> Then, I've been giving it<br> a lot of thought.<br> And what they did to those women,<br> and what they did about Walter.<br> I used to always tell him, "You never<br> start a fight, but you always finish it."<br> And I didn't start this<br> fight, but I'm gonna finish it.<br> Mrs. Collins, right now you're a<br> sufficiently high profile that I think<br> even the police would hesitate<br> to go after you out in the open,<br> but I have to warn you that<br> could change very quickly<br> if they feel their<br> position threatened.<br> Very quickly indeed.<br> What are they gonna<br> do to me now?<br> They got nothing.<br> I'm going home.<br> Hi, sis.<br> Gordon.<br> I didn't know<br> you were back in town.<br> Yeah, I got in<br> a couple of days ago,<br> figured I'd surprise you.<br> Is that... Is that okay?<br> Yes. Yes, of course.<br> Of course, come on in.<br> Where's that<br> little niece of mine?<br> She went into town.<br> Should be back this evening.<br> Uh, Bob's here.<br> Oh, good.<br> Uh, I was gonna ask if I<br> could stay on a couple days.<br> Staying?<br> Yeah.<br> Listen, can I use<br> your bathroom?<br> It's been a long ride and<br> I could really use a shower.<br> Of course.<br> - Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Is that...<br> All right, go next door.<br> I'll call the police. Hurry.<br> Operator.<br> How may I connect you?<br> He's upstairs, sir.<br> Go around the other side!<br> Cut him off!<br> Come with me!<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Let's go!<br> Mrs. Collins, I'd like you<br> to meet my friend, Mr. Hahn.<br> Mrs. Collins, my deepest<br> condolences on your loss.<br> May we come in?<br> I appreciate the sentiment,<br> but they've yet to find...<br> To identify the<br> remains as my son.<br> I'm afraid it never<br> gets any easier.<br> I lost a daughter<br> to polio five years ago.<br> There's not a day goes by<br> when I don't think,<br> "I should mention<br> this to Claudine."<br> Then I remember<br> she's not here.<br> Please, sit.<br> I've been on the phone<br> all morning<br> with the appointment secretary<br> of the police commission.<br> They said that they<br> won't let me testify<br> at the hearing or call witnesses.<br> That it won't be necessary.<br> I know. My sources say<br> the police commission<br> is going to say that Jones and the<br> LAPD did absolutely nothing wrong,<br> and that the real blame lies<br> with the kid and with you<br> for being difficult and forcing them<br> to put you away for your own safety.<br> Then I guess I would have to<br> hire a lawyer, file a civil suit.<br> I went to the best<br> attorney in town,<br> a man who's sued this<br> city four times and won.<br> Unfortunately, we can't<br> afford to really hire him.<br> I see.<br> Which is why<br> I'm doing this pro bono.<br> It would be my honor to defend<br> your honor, Mrs. Collins.<br> In my 15 years as a lawyer,<br> I have never seen anyone fight<br> as long or as hard as you have,<br> in what is so clearly<br> in the cause of justice.<br> Thank you.<br> Let me see<br> what's on the shelf.<br> I'll look.<br> Yes? May I...<br> My name is S.S. Hahn,<br> and I have a court order for the immediate<br> release of all women being detained<br> in this institution under<br> the designation code 12<br> pending a formal inquiry into<br> the reasons for their detainment.<br> I'm sorry, the doctor<br> in charge is not here<br> until the morning.<br> - Madam, let me be clearer.<br> Either you will produce the<br> people named in that court order,<br> or you will find yourself behind<br> bars, and I mean without a key.<br> I can't authorize you...<br> - Madam, stand aside.<br> Can I see her now?<br> Sure. Absolutely.<br> - How does she look?<br> All right, fellas,<br> step back. Let's give him room.<br> Here he is.<br> Mr. Northcott,<br> any comment on your arrest?<br> Mr. Northcott,<br> how are you feeling?<br> Oh, I'm feeling fine.<br> I've been on a little<br> vacation, as some of you know.<br> It was<br> a really pleasant vacation.<br> The police have certainly provided<br> me with a lot of amusement.<br> How long<br> you been in hiding?<br> How did you<br> avoid capture?<br> Easy, easy.<br> That's far enough.<br> Well, I didn't, did I?<br> One more shot!<br> Have you seen<br> your picture in the paper?<br> Didn't know anybody<br> wanted me until just recently.<br> Didn't even try.<br> My luggage still has<br> my initials on it, fellas.<br> Did you know why<br> the police were after you?<br> No, but I figured it'd be a good<br> idea if I were to just stay out of it.<br> Any remorse, sir?<br> Do you have anything to say to<br> the parents of the children you murdered?<br> No comment.<br> One more shot,<br> this way!<br> Mayor Cryer.<br> This is unexpected.<br> So was this.<br> Subpoenas, requests for<br> depositions, interrogatories.<br> All courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his<br> new client, Christine Collins.<br> You don't have to look them<br> over too closely, Chief.<br> Your own copies should<br> be coming any time now.<br> The city council has also<br> agreed to look into this,<br> starting immediately.<br> God damn it!<br> I thought this was<br> supposed to go away.<br> This is an election year.<br> I can't afford<br> this kind of press.<br> It is going away, sir. I've instructed<br> Captain Jones to deal with it.<br> I'm afraid,<br> falling on his sword<br> and saying he made a mistake isn't<br> going to be good enough, Chief.<br> If we take him out of<br> the picture for a while,<br> just might help calm things down<br> until the hearing's finished.<br> What is happening?<br> - Didn't you hear?<br> It's the biggest protest<br> I've ever seen.<br> Protest?<br> - Yeah.<br> Over the Collins broad,<br> if you can believe that.<br> We want<br> justice! We want justice!<br> Oh, my!<br> Mr. Harris.<br> The Lord works in mysterious<br> ways, Mrs. Collins.<br> Boy, does he ever.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, can<br> I have your attention, please?<br> There are more people gathered in this chamber<br> than have ever been in this room before.<br> Therefore, I ask you to refrain<br> from demonstrations of any kind.<br> Tell the truth! Tell the truth!<br> We are all here because we want to<br> know the real facts in this case.<br> And everybody is going to be heard<br> if we have to sit here for a week.<br> Mr. Thorpe, I don't see any<br> members of the police commission.<br> Are there any members of<br> the police department in the room?<br> Is Chief Davis here?<br> Is Captain Jones here?<br> Is there anybody here<br> representing the police?<br> Mrs. Collins, could you come across<br> the street with me for just a moment?<br> There's something<br> I think you should see.<br> Well, I hate to call a<br> recess before we've even started,<br> but I think a few<br> phone calls are in order.<br> The police decided it'd be best<br> to keep this off the main docket<br> in order to avoid exactly the sort<br> of chaos we have across the street.<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> I'm Leanne Clay.<br> This is my husband, John.<br> - Hi.<br> I just wanted to pass<br> along my sympathies.<br> What we went through<br> waiting to hear anything<br> about our son David<br> was bad enough, now this.<br> But what the police did to<br> you, there was no call for that.<br> No call at all.<br> All rise.<br> Please, be seated.<br> - Bailiff.<br> Oh, hey.<br> I saw you in the papers.<br> You got a lot of moxie, standing<br> up to the police like that.<br> The defendant<br> will please rise.<br> Gordon Stewart Northcott,<br> you've been charged with three<br> counts of murder in the first degree,<br> with an additional 17 counts under<br> review by the district attorney's office.<br> How do you plea?<br> Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.<br> You may sit, Mr. Northcott.<br> In light of the defendant's penchant for<br> international travel, no bail will be set.<br> This court will hear preliminary<br> motions by tomorrow morning.<br> The boy, Walter Collins,<br> was reported as missing,<br> March 10, 1928.<br> We then instituted<br> a nationwide search.<br> On August 18th, we received<br> a cable indicating that a boy<br> matching his description was<br> found in DeKalb, Illinois.<br> Upon questioning, he admitted<br> to being Walter Collins.<br> We then made arrangements for him<br> to be transported back to California.<br> Where Mrs. Collins told you<br> the boy was not her son.<br> Yes. She denied<br> his identity<br> in spite of all of the evidence<br> pointing to the contrary.<br> But, as subsequent<br> events have demonstrated,<br> she was correct.<br> So, what prompted<br> you to send her<br> for psychological<br> evaluation?<br> Whether or not this was<br> in fact the correct boy<br> was not relevant<br> to my decision.<br> Throughout this period,<br> she acted strangely.<br> She was often cool<br> and aloof and unemotional,<br> especially when confronted<br> with the boy we found in DeKalb<br> and in our<br> subsequent conversation.<br> It was because of her<br> disturbing behavior that I<br> submitted her for observation<br> to the psychopathic ward of Los<br> Angeles County General Hospital.<br> Just like that.<br> You snap your fingers<br> and an innocent woman<br> is thrown<br> into the psycho ward!<br> She wasn't thrown. Every family<br> in this state is in grave danger<br> when a police captain can<br> take a woman into his office<br> and five minutes later<br> have her thrown into the psychopathic<br> ward on his own authority!<br> She wasn't thrown.<br> She wasn't thrown!<br> She wasn't thrown!<br> What was that, Captain?<br> She wasn't thrown.<br> She was escorted.<br> Escorted, thrown, the verb<br> doesn't matter, Captain.<br> What does matter is that her incarceration<br> was ordered without a warrant.<br> I am holding a carbon copy<br> of the affidavit of insanity<br> that was issued in the case<br> of the State of California<br> v. Christine Collins.<br> Who signed the affidavit?<br> I did.<br> Well, now, let me see<br> if I have this correct,<br> a woman was thrown into the<br> psychopathic ward without a warrant,<br> because no warrant existed.<br> And when it was finally<br> written several days later,<br> there was no need to sign it<br> or to go to a judge<br> because she was already<br> in the asylum!<br> Is this correct, Captain?<br> Technically, yes.<br> Extraordinary steps were necessary<br> because we were dealing...<br> We were dealing with<br> an extraordinary situation.<br> Now, is it our fault<br> that we were being deceived<br> by a boy who claimed to<br> be Walter Collins? No.<br> In light of his claims<br> and her disturbing behavior,<br> who wouldn't begin to think that there<br> was something the matter with her?<br> Because she questioned you?<br> No, because<br> she wouldn't listen!<br> Because she insisted<br> on being obstinate!<br> Because she tried to take<br> matters into her own hand,<br> best left to<br> qualified officers!<br> Because once<br> civil disobedience starts...<br> Because she was fighting<br> for the life of her son!<br> A boy who may have<br> still been alive<br> while you were wasting valuable time<br> denying you had done anything wrong!<br> And in the end<br> that's what<br> happened, isn't it?<br> At some point, while<br> all this was going on,<br> Walter Collins<br> was brutally murdered,<br> along with as many<br> as 19 other boys<br> at the Northcott Ranch<br> in Wineville.<br> Is that correct, Captain?<br> Yes, it is.<br> It's a travesty.<br> No further questions.<br> Train number 14,<br> now boarding on track...<br> So, after much effort, we<br> were able to identify this boy,<br> who's been responsible<br> for so much trouble lately,<br> as Arthur Hutchins<br> of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.<br> Between this, and the arrest of<br> the man suspected of murdering<br> the real Walter Collins,<br> we've cleared up two of the biggest<br> mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.<br> I hope you gentlemen<br> of the press will give<br> as much space to the<br> good things we do<br> as the mistakes that are<br> made on rare occasions.<br> Gentlemen, allow me<br> to introduce you<br> to the boy's real mother,<br> Mrs. Janet Hutchins.<br> Arthur.<br> I hope he wasn't too<br> much trouble for you.<br> Oh, no, not at all.<br> How about<br> a photograph, fellas?<br> One more.<br> Mrs. Hutchins,<br> Mrs. Collins, the woman he was<br> staying with, wanted him to have these.<br> They're the clothes<br> she let him wear.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Isn't that nice, Arthur?<br> Tell the nice officer,<br> "Thank you."<br> I don't want them.<br> Give them to somebody else.<br> Precocious<br> little fellow, isn't he?<br> It's not my fault.<br> It's the police.<br> They said I was Walter Collins,<br> not me! It wasn't my idea!<br> Not my idea!<br> - Get...<br> Yeah. Go blame the police<br> for your own mistakes.<br> We've seen a lot of<br> that lately, haven't we?<br> Take care now, Arthur!<br> Safe travels.<br> All right, fellas,<br> that's it for today.<br> Sir, sir! What<br> did the boy mean by that?<br> It was March 10th, and<br> I came home from work,<br> and my nine-year-old<br> son, Walter, was gone.<br> Captain Jones was acting on<br> information he believed to be correct.<br> Walter Collins had a diastema,<br> also known as a diastema.<br> That child was never<br> in my classroom.<br> I can certainly<br> attest to that.<br> We rely on our good<br> friends in the police department<br> to point to us those<br> people who exhibit behavior<br> which is socially<br> unacceptable.<br> About four inches<br> shorter than the last mark of Walter.<br> Well, some of<br> these pictures show<br> what Sanford Clark<br> told me,<br> that he did in fact help in<br> the murder of these children.<br> Thank you, Detective.<br> Gentlemen of the jury,<br> I ask you to take a good<br> look at these images.<br> They establish beyond<br> any reasonable doubt<br> the circumstances and the<br> nature of these heinous crimes.<br> I'm in here,<br> Reverend.<br> When Walter was here, I<br> used to walk by his room<br> when he was sleeping.<br> And even though I couldn't<br> see him or hear him,<br> I could feel him.<br> That's why I don't<br> think Walter's dead.<br> I can still feel him.<br> Mrs. Collins...<br> - No.<br> I know what<br> the police said.<br> But that place<br> and the remains,<br> they couldn't be<br> properly identified.<br> And maybe that kid made a mistake<br> when he picked Walter's picture.<br> I understand you don't<br> want to accept this.<br> What mother would?<br> But I think it's time<br> for you to move on<br> and start over<br> for yourself.<br> Your son would<br> want you to move on.<br> Maybe.<br> Maybe he'd want me<br> to keep looking for him.<br> Maybe he's somewhere<br> waiting for me.<br> I believe he is<br> waiting, ma'am.<br> He's waiting in<br> that place where<br> we'll all go someday to be<br> reunited with our loved ones.<br> And on that day, he'll know<br> from front to back, end to end,<br> heart to soul, that you did<br> everything you could, Mrs. Collins.<br> Everything.<br> We should go, ma'am.<br> One minute.<br> This meeting will<br> now come to order.<br> This committee has now<br> heard all of the testimony,<br> and, in light of<br> the facts presented,<br> we recommend that the<br> suspension of Captain Jones<br> be made permanent.<br> Order! Please. Please.<br> Mr. Foreman,<br> has the jury<br> reached a verdict?<br> We have, Your Honor.<br> Will the defendant<br> please rise?<br> Second, that steps be taken<br> to investigate a change<br> in the prevailing laws and<br> procedures by which a citizen<br> of this city can be<br> subjected to incarceration<br> in the county's<br> mental facilities.<br> You may read the verdict.<br> "We the jury find the defendant,<br> Gordon Stewart Northcott,<br> "guilty on all counts of<br> murder in the first degree."<br> Finally, restoration of public<br> confidence in the police department<br> can only be achieved<br> by the removal of<br> its chief of police,<br> and this committee<br> so recommends.<br> This hearing<br> is concluded.<br> Does the defendant wish to make a<br> statement before judgment is passed?<br> I want to make<br> it real clear<br> that I never once got<br> a fair shake from you,<br> Your Honor,<br> or from this court.<br> The only one in here worth<br> a good goddamn is her.<br> 'Cause she's the only one who<br> never badmouthed me to the press.<br> She's the only one<br> who understands<br> what it is to be<br> framed by the police<br> for something you didn't<br> do. All right, that's enough.<br> And then to just be<br> thrown in the hole,<br> to just rot and to fester<br> and to be forgotten<br> and fade away, isn't that right?<br> - Gordon!<br> Counsel!<br> - Isn't it?<br> I never killed your boy,<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> Counsel, that's enough!<br> - I would never do that.<br> I would never<br> hurt Walter.<br> Counsel, get control<br> of your client<br> or I'll have him<br> bound and gagged!<br> He's an angel.<br> Come on, Gordon.<br> - Get off of me!<br> Now get down.<br> Gordon Stewart Northcott,<br> it is the judgment<br> of this court<br> that you be conveyed<br> to San Quentin Prison,<br> where you'll be held in solitary<br> confinement for a period of two years,<br> until October 2, 1930.<br> On that date, you will be<br> hanged by the neck until dead.<br> May God have<br> mercy on your soul.<br> Is it all right if I<br> have a 10-minute break?<br> Of course.<br> You know,<br> one of these days you might<br> actually consider taking<br> one of these<br> It might be<br> good for you.<br> We'll see.<br> This is<br> Christine Collins.<br> I called yesterday.<br> I was wondering if you had a<br> chance to look through the files<br> and see if there was a match<br> to my son, Walter Collins.<br> I see.<br> Well, if it's all<br> right with you,<br> I'll call back in a<br> month. Thank you very much.<br> Mrs. Collins.<br> - I was just...<br> Yes, I know.<br> In fact, that's why<br> I wanted to see you.<br> It's about Walter.<br> We had a...<br> Well, we received<br> a very strange telegram.<br> From who?<br> Gordon Northcott.<br> He's asked to see you.<br> Why?<br> He said he knows you're<br> still looking for your son,<br> and before he dies...<br> He says he lied when he testified<br> that he didn't kill Walter.<br> Christine, he's willing to<br> finally admit that he did it.<br> He says if you come up<br> to see him in person,<br> then he'll tell you<br> the truth, to your face<br> so that you can get<br> on with your life<br> and have some peace.<br> As you know, he's<br> set to be executed<br> the day after tomorrow<br> at San Quentin,<br> so you don't have<br> a lot of time.<br> It took me most of the morning<br> to make all the arrangements.<br> Turns out, you're the<br> first woman in 30 years<br> the state has allowed<br> to visit a serial killer<br> on the eve of<br> his execution.<br> You'll be all<br> right, ma'am?<br> Yes.<br> - We're right at the door.<br> Twenty minutes.<br> Don't suppose you<br> got a cigarette?<br> Mr. Northcott, you<br> asked me to come here.<br> You said that<br> if I did,<br> you would tell me<br> the truth about my son.<br> Yeah.<br> You're right.<br> I did say that.<br> But see, the thing is,<br> I didn't really think<br> that you would come.<br> And now.<br> And now...<br> And now what?<br> I just didn't<br> expect that you'd...<br> I don't wanna see you.<br> You don't wanna see me?<br> No. See, I can't do this.<br> I don't wanna talk to you. I<br> can't talk to you right now,<br> not with what they're gonna<br> be doing to me tomorrow.<br> It's one thing, Mrs.<br> Collins, to send a telegram,<br> that is really easy.<br> But when it's here, right<br> now, in person, you know,<br> I just, I can't...<br> I can't tell you what you<br> want to hear, Mrs. Collins.<br> And why not?<br> Because I don't want to go<br> to hell with a lie on my lips.<br> See, I did my penance,<br> and I asked God to forgive me<br> and he did, so far as I know.<br> And I have been<br> really good ever since.<br> But if I lie now, if I<br> commit any sins right now,<br> I'm out of time here,<br> and I won't be<br> forgiven again.<br> And I'll tell you one thing,<br> I am not going to hell.<br> I'm not...<br> Mr. Northcott, you<br> asked me to come here.<br> Mr. Northcott,<br> please look at me.<br> Mr. Northcott,<br> please look at me.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> Did you kill my son?<br> I don't know what<br> you're talking about.<br> Yes, you do. Yes, you do.<br> - Hmm.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> I told you, I don't wanna<br> talk to you right now.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> Did you kill my son?<br> Did you kill my son?<br> - Hmm.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> - I don't know.<br> You don't know?<br> You don't remember?<br> Did you kill my son?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Answer me!<br> You answer me! You answer me!<br> I don't know their names.<br> - Did you kill my son? Yes...<br> You better get off of me.<br> Or what?<br> - Hmm.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> - I don't know.<br> Did you kill...<br> Did you kill my son?<br> You know his name!<br> - Oh, I don't. No.<br> You know his name!<br> You called him an angel!<br> No.<br> - You know his name!<br> No, I don't know his name.<br> - Did you kill my son?<br> They cried for their parents to<br> come and get them and then I...<br> Did you kill my son?<br> Did you kill my son?<br> Answer me!<br> - Or what?<br> Answer me!<br> What are you<br> gonna do? You gonna hurt me?<br> I hope you go to hell.<br> I hope you go to hell.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> - Guard! Hey, guard!<br> Did you kill my son?<br> Did you kill my son?<br> - Ma'am, please.<br> Come on.<br> - I hope you go to hell!<br> I hope you go to hell!<br> I hope you go to hell!<br> I'm sorry, ma'am.<br> Did you kill my son?<br> "Gordon Stewart Northcott,<br> "you have been<br> convicted of murder,<br> "the penalty for which<br> is death by hanging.<br> "There have been<br> no stays or reprieves,<br> "therefore the execution<br> will go forward<br> "as stipulated under the laws<br> of the State of California."<br> Do you have<br> any last words?<br> No.<br> Nothing.<br> I kept clean after<br> I confessed, Reverend,<br> just like I said I would.<br> Will it...<br> Will it hurt?<br> Please,<br> please, not so fast.<br> Please, don't make<br> me walk so fast!<br> Please,<br> don't make me!<br> No, I don't wanna.<br> No!

I knew it,<br> I knew it, I knew it!<br> Dinner is on me.<br> Is this Christine Collins?<br> Yes, it is.<br> This is Mrs. Clay.<br> Do you remember me?<br> Mrs. Clay,<br> of course I remember you.<br> I just had to<br> call you right off.<br> What is it?<br> - The police just called.<br> They found a boy,<br> Christine.<br> Where?<br> - Lincoln Heights Precinct.<br> We're leaving right now.<br> I'll be right down.<br> Oh, here.<br> I wanted to go<br> to him right off,<br> but they said it was important<br> to talk to him alone first.<br> Are they sure?<br> - They're sure.<br> But, more important,<br> I'm sure.<br> It's my boy, all right.<br> It's David.<br> He's alive, Christine.<br> They found him<br> up in Hesperia.<br> You were<br> walking home from school,<br> and they told you they<br> needed help finding a dog.<br> Yeah.<br> So, after you got in the<br> truck, what happened next?<br> They drove me around<br> for a long time,<br> then we ended up<br> at this ranch.<br> Come on. Come on, Davy.<br> Davy! Come on.<br> - Get off me.<br> Don't fight<br> this much. Hey!<br> Were there other<br> boys there?<br> Yeah. Five, I think.<br> It was a long<br> time ago, though.<br> Hello, boys.<br> This is Davy.<br> I know you'll make<br> him feel... Hey!<br> No. No! Hey! Shut up!<br> Did you speak to them?<br> Yeah? You remember<br> any of their names?<br> Yeah.<br> Two of them<br> were brothers.<br> I think their last<br> name was Winslow.<br> The oldest one<br> was Jeffrey.<br> And Walter.<br> Walter?<br> Yeah.<br> - Do you remember Walter's last name?<br> Collins.<br> Walter Collins.<br> Tell me something if you only<br> remember some of the boys' names,<br> how come you remember<br> his full name?<br> Because of<br> what happened.<br> Walter and Jeffrey<br> were talking.<br> Pull it.<br> - They kept checking around<br> and they found a part of the coop<br> where the wire was all messed up.<br> Be careful!<br> Hurry!<br> Maybe make enough room to<br> get out of there and run.<br> When we get<br> out, we split up,<br> go in different<br> directions. Okay?<br> They can't catch all of us.<br> It'd make an awful<br> lot of noise.<br> Be quiet. You got it?<br> And if it wasn't wide<br> enough, then we'd be stuck.<br> Wait.<br> Help! Help! Come on, hurry!<br> My foot's stuck! Hurry,<br> help! Help me, please!<br> He's coming!<br> He's...<br> My foot!<br> He's coming.<br> Hurry, run, run, run!<br> Hey! What<br> the hell are you boys...<br> Oh! Mary, Mother of<br> God! Hey! Hey! Hey!<br> You get back here!<br> Hey! Hold it! Hey!<br> Hey!<br> Hey!<br> Stop!<br> Check on the others!<br> Stop! Damn it!<br> Boys,<br> I'm coming after you!<br> Damn it! Damn it!<br> Boys, I'll find you no<br> matter where you are!<br> They're not in there!<br> - Come on! Get in the car!<br> I'm gonna find you! Damn<br> it! Damn it! Come on.<br> Shit! Get in<br> the car, Sanford!<br> That was the last<br> I saw of any of them.<br> So, you don't know if either<br> of the other two were captured?<br> No.<br> All I know is,<br> if Walter hadn't<br> come back for me<br> I don't think I ever would've<br> gotten out of there.<br> Okay.<br> So, what happened<br> after that?<br> I kept off<br> the main roads,<br> until I saw a train stopped<br> at a crossing and I jumped in.<br> Why didn't you tell<br> anyone what had happened?<br> I was afraid.<br> I thought they'd come<br> after me, or my folks.<br> So, I just didn't<br> tell anybody.<br> I was on my own until I got a free<br> meal from this lady, Miss Lansing.<br> Told her I was an<br> orphan, on my own.<br> She said I could stay on.<br> And I did.<br> Every night,<br> I'd wake up thinking they<br> were right outside my window.<br> And then I heard the<br> police talking on the radio<br> about what happened<br> at the ranch.<br> And I thought, "For sure<br> I can't go back now."<br> Why?<br> Why not?<br> Since I didn't tell<br> anybody what happened.<br> I was afraid they'd blame<br> me for those kids being dead.<br> So I just stayed away.<br> What made you come forward<br> now, after all this time?<br> Hmm? Why come<br> forward now?<br> I really miss my mom.<br> I really miss my dad.<br> I just wanna go home.<br> I just wanna go home.<br> Are you all right?<br> I love you.<br> I still can't believe it.<br> Five years, case closed, everyone<br> thinks he's dead, and there he is.<br> Wouldn't be, if it<br> wasn't for Walter.<br> Your son did a brave<br> thing, Mrs. Collins.<br> You should be<br> very proud of him.<br> I am.<br> You still think<br> he's out there?<br> Why not?<br> Three boys made a run for<br> it that night, Detective.<br> And if one got out,<br> then maybe either or both<br> of the others did, too.<br> Maybe Walter's out there, having<br> the same fears that he did.<br> Afraid to come home<br> and identify himself,<br> or afraid he'll get<br> into trouble.<br> But either way,<br> it gives me something I<br> didn't have before tonight.<br> What's that?<br> Hope.<br>
