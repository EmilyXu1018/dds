That suit cost me good money.<br> Fred, you old devil.<br> You watch him now.<br> Tomorrow he'll be at sea.<br> Don't say I didn't warn you.<br> Good evening. I booked a table.<br> Name of Chaplin.<br> Mr. Charles Chaplin.<br> I booked it a week ago.<br> There's nothing here, sir.<br> We're fully booked.<br> There must be some error.<br> I really did book that table.<br> You know?<br> I know.<br> It's cause that geezer<br> saw us with Karno.<br> They won't have theatricals<br> in them fancy places.<br> You wait. Someday they'll beg.<br> We'll walk in, you and me.<br> You in a fur, dripping jewels<br> me in my own whistle.<br> Whistle?<br> Whistle and flute. Suit.<br> Oh, I see.<br> Will you marry me?<br> No.<br> Where would I get the jewels?<br> From me. Engagement rings<br> wedding tiaras, rubies...<br> Charlie, I can't marry you.<br> I don't see why not.<br> I'm only sixteen.<br> But you'll get over that. Why else?<br> We hardly know each other.<br> This is our first date.<br> When I return from America<br> we'll spend more time together.<br> Are you serious?<br> Were you, Charlie?<br> You say you were.<br> I want to make sure.<br> It's on page forty-something.<br> Thirty-three.<br> I mean, you never even kissed her.<br> You think I don't know that?<br> I'll just backtrack for a moment.<br> After you had your mother<br> committed it all gets a bit vague.<br> Yes, it does.<br> Why?<br> Because I don't wish to remember.<br> Fair enough. But...<br> ...if you'll allow me to say so...<br> ...I don't think, and I know<br> this sounds very American<br> you shouldn't be afraid to let<br> the readers share your feelings.<br> Know what I mean?<br> You'll break me heart<br> if you say no.<br> At least say you'll wait for me.<br> I'll wait for you.<br> How long will you be in America?<br> I don't know exactly.<br> It depends if they like the drunk act.<br> If they throw things<br> I won't be gone long.<br> They won't throw things.<br> They'll think you're wonderful.<br> I think you're wonderful.<br> The funny thing is...<br> ...you never mentioned love.<br> I don't have to, do I?<br> The number nine's in from Chicago.<br> Let's load up the steers.<br> Nickel.<br> Sit down.<br> Have you seen that English bloke?<br> Watch this.<br> I've seen it before.<br> A telegram came for you.<br> Show it again.<br> You've seen everything twice.<br> The one with the fire engine.<br> You'll love this one.<br> If any of them could act<br> they'd be on the stage.<br> Charlie, it's a telegram.<br> That can only mean somebody's died.<br> Some bloke's offered me<br> a job in California.<br> In the flickers!<br> The flickers aren't legit.<br> A hundred and fifty a week.<br> A hundred and fifty a week!<br> Watch your step.<br> Mack Sennett Studios<br> Hit him harder, Fred.<br> Harder.<br> Put some muscle into it.<br> This ain't a Sunday school picnic.<br> Ready when you are, Mr. Sennett.<br> Someone's in the shot.<br> Keep cranking. Still cranking!<br> Cut. Cut it! Jesus Christ!<br> Was it good till the dummies fell out?<br> How could I find Mr. Mack Sennett?<br> What the hell were you doing?<br> I'm afraid you just found him.<br> Hello, sir. I'm Charlie Chaplin.<br> You sent me a telegram.<br> Butte, Montana. You hired me<br> for a year, Mr. Sennett.<br> You're not Chaplin. Chaplin did<br> the best comedy drunk I ever saw.<br> I don't pay $100 a week to kids.<br> Another one, boss?<br> - No.<br> Mr. Sennett?<br> You might be Chaplin, after all.<br> And it was $150.<br> Plum in the middle of a shot.<br> You sure screwed it up, didn't you?<br> Fix it, will you, Rollie?<br> We don't print until we cut it.<br> That was negative, kid.<br> I know this is new to you<br> this is not an ancient industry.<br> It's all built around speed.<br> Start the story, the chase.<br> I get bored easy is why.<br> How much of Mabel? A couple of yards?<br> Yeah. No, try three.<br> But we don't sacrifice quality.<br> I only make two pictures a week.<br> I'll spend up to $1000 on each.<br> Well, Rollie?<br> Almost done.<br> Waste not, want not. That's my motto.<br> When Rollie's done, no one<br> will know you were there.<br> I'm rewinding.<br> You're on the cutting room floor.<br> Not the place to be.<br> Got it.<br> Forget everything you ever learned.<br> You're not in the theatre anymore.<br> That did it.<br> If you need me, I'll be with Mabel.<br> Nothing quite like it.<br> The feeling of film. But was it clear...<br> ...how much the movies terrified me?<br> Not really. Why?<br> You must help me get that right.<br> I was right to be scared.<br> I was dreadful.<br> Sennett wished he'd never hired me.<br> I could barely keep control.<br> I would have been a total disaster<br> if I hadn't invented the tramp.<br> I wanted to talk to you<br> about that section.<br> The words just poured out.<br> It practically wrote itself.<br> I'd only been with Sennett a month.<br> That magical moment<br> as I walked through...<br> ...the wardrobe door.<br> I felt possessed.<br> I could feel him calling out to me.<br> The Tramp.<br> Bullshit. And you know it.<br> But the truth was so boring, George.<br> Jesus.<br> You told him to change.<br> - Into what, a suit of armor?<br> Chaplin! Get your ass<br> onto this stage, right now!<br> Forget the Limey. Get cranking.<br> Okay! Begin!<br> Very formal, everyone.<br> What the hell? He's crazy.<br> What do I do?<br> Cut it. No, wait. Hold it. Keep going.<br> Maybe he's not so crazy.<br> Photographer! Henry!<br> Chase him around the camera!<br> Okay, put him in line.<br> Big reaction! Who is this?<br> Stay down, Henry. Stay down!<br> Groom! Look jealous!<br> Jealous! Better than that!<br> Mabel give the tramp the eye.<br> That's right.<br> Matron, you're real hoity-toity.<br> Who is this bum? Good. Very good.<br> Groom, he's trying to steal your bride!<br> Matron, hit him!<br> All right! Domino fall! Domino fall!<br> Start the chase!<br> Don't stop! Keep going!<br> Good! Good! Terrific!<br> Look into the camera.<br> Snap it.<br> Watch the bride.<br> That's enough. Cut.<br> Chaplin, what are you trying<br> to do to me?<br> I knew I was right to hire him.<br> Listen.<br> You do what I say<br> or I'll report you to Mack.<br> You stand up right now.<br> Pick up this hose and when I say<br> sprinkle the road.<br> I could do more with that hose.<br> I could be funny.<br> Two months you think you know<br> everything. I'm the director.<br> This is not a movie about<br> being funny with a hose.<br> You're right. But it could be.<br> Chaplin!<br> He's coming.<br> I don't insist you fire him<br> but if you do, that's fine.<br> I'd love to axe the Limey<br> but I talked to new York.<br> It seems he's an asset to the company.<br> But I'll make sure he knows<br> you're a great director.<br> Is Mack ever waiting for you!<br> Come in.<br> Charlie, come in, please.<br> You got to help me with Mabel.<br> She actually thinks she can direct.<br> You're not mad, then?<br> I've been waiting for an actor<br> to have the guts to stand up to her.<br> I really like you, Charlie.<br> I really like you too, Mack.<br> And I'll bet you've talked to New York.<br> Let me direct the next one.<br> How do you know you can?<br> - I couldn't do worse.<br> Says you. What if no one wants it?<br> What if it stinks?<br> Who'll pay?<br> I've never seen you pick up a check.<br> I'll pay.<br> This is my work.<br> Did you pay?<br> No. But, boy, did I work.<br> I directed more than 20 films<br> by the year's end.<br> Why didn't you send for Hetty?<br> I did write. Never got a reply.<br> I thought she might be on tour.<br> So I asked Syd to track her down...<br> ...see how she felt.<br> My god, look at him!<br> Dressed in style with your father's<br> old green tie on.<br> I wouldn't give you tuppence<br> for your old watch chain, old iron.<br> This is Minnie.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> Give us a hand, Chas, come on.<br> Why did you pick him?<br> - He's not so bad.<br> Our Syd's all right.<br> I don't know, Chas.<br> I don't see anybody staring at you.<br> Nice flivver. How long you had it?<br> - A couple of weeks.<br> When do I meet Mr. Sennett?<br> Got something to show you first.<br> Look!<br> New Chaplin Film<br> I don't believe it!<br> It's all happened so quick, Chas.<br> Last year, you were in vaudeville.<br> I'm top of the bill.<br> I still don't see anyone staring at you.<br> I don't look like me.<br> What news?<br> Mum? Oh, Mum is fine.<br> Well, not fine<br> but there are lots of good days.<br> Well, not lots. But some.<br> And Hetty. Does she know?<br> The whole world knows about you.<br> She gave me this for you.<br> Fancy Hetty writing.<br> Look at this.<br> She got married.<br> I know.<br> I'm not surprised.<br> I wish her lots of happiness.<br> Well, not lots. But some.<br> Chin up, kid.<br> See, I was right. He is the<br> most famous man in the world.<br> Value for money is what we want, sir.<br> Charlie, take this guy back<br> to the asylum.<br> Syd's my manager. He left his<br> acting career to handle me.<br> Woe is me!<br> The theatre will never be the same.<br> What career? A thousand a week<br> is more than I get.<br> Charlie's name is bigger<br> if you'll pardon me for saying so.<br> Charlie, I've been so rotten to you!<br> I don't know if you can forgive me.<br> I forced you to leave Butte, Montana.<br> I made you accept<br> a hundred and fifty per week.<br> I stuffed directing down<br> your throat, too.<br> Tell me how Uncle Mack can<br> make it up to you!<br> I want to run my own show.<br> I want control.<br> Dream on, kid. I know this business.<br> You're not that big.<br> First time I've seen you miss.<br> But, Charlie, Mack Sennett<br> was the king of comedy.<br> He gave you your start. How could<br> you walk out and leave him?<br> The reasons are clearly intellectual.<br> Money.<br> So you joined up with<br> Bronco Billy Anderson...<br> ...a puffed-up cowboy star?<br> Not the high point of my career.<br> But I wanted my own studio.<br> I was putting money aside<br> to build one.<br> Excuse me.<br> Do you always eat alone?<br> Only when I'm trying to meet someone.<br> Actually, I'm waiting for my girlfriend.<br> I'm a motion picture director.<br> I'm forming a new company<br> with Bronco Billy over there.<br> And you need a new leading lady.<br> Lucky me.<br> You must be an actress, miss...<br> Purviance. Sorry. Just a secretary.<br> I'm auditioning actresses<br> who aren't actresses.<br> Well, if you need an untalented<br> actress who isn't an actress...<br> ...you couldn't do better than me.<br> Worse than me.<br> Don't you want to know who I am?<br> I have no interest in who you are.<br> Mr. Chaplin.<br> Cut.<br> Not great.<br> We'll do another.<br> If I eat one more bean<br> I'm going to be sick.<br> You almost had it. But this time...<br> ...not quite so dainty. You're starving.<br> I know.<br> But it's hard to be hungry<br> after 46 takes.<br> But no one could do it as well.<br> We both know it.<br> I'll do my best.<br> How about dinner tonight?<br> Chili con carne.<br> I'll kill you, Charlie.<br> More beans.<br> Camera.<br> Action!<br> The arrival in the land of liberty.<br> That's all for today, folks.<br> Good to know I can count<br> on my nearest and dearest.<br> Don't come it with me.<br> "Arrival in the land of liberty"?<br> Showing the statue?<br> What are you playing at?<br> No one else seemed to mind.<br> Kicking an immigration officer<br> on the backside.<br> You think that's funny?<br> For those of us with a sense<br> of humor, very.<br> It was supposed to be a comedy.<br> You've turned it into a bloody<br> political tract.<br> We're guests here.<br> You can't criticize the way it's run.<br> Syd, I love this country.<br> I owe it everything.<br> That's why I can criticize it.<br> Why I must.<br> Remember where we're from.<br> There's a war going on, remember?<br> You make a million a year<br> while British boys die in France.<br> The London papers are after you.<br> You want that here, too?<br> I registered for the draft.<br> They never called me.<br> It isn't like I'm hard to find.<br> I'm on your side, kid.<br> First one on board, remember?<br> Be careful, Chas.<br> Just watch it.<br> That's all I'm saying.<br> You said you detested studio parties.<br> The worst. But not where<br> Doug Fairbanks was concerned.<br> Life was fun when Doug was around.<br> I don't think anyone today remembers<br> what a huge star he was.<br> I mean in those days, he was huge.<br> Men liked him.<br> Women adored him.<br> He was royalty.<br> Look out below!<br> Sire, you are most truly welcome.<br> Great party, Doug.<br> Isn't it fabulous?<br> - Wonderful.<br> I hate it more than you do.<br> I doubt it.<br> Of course everything changed<br> when America's Sweetheart came.<br> You mean Mary Pickford?<br> I always found her to be something<br> of an undersized bitch.<br> But Doug fell for her<br> like a ton of bricks.<br> Hello, Charlie.<br> Hi, Doug. Thanks for inviting me.<br> Mary. It's a pleasure.<br> Duty calls. Excuse me.<br> He's really a lovely person, Charlie.<br> Yes. Hungry?<br> Her name is Mildred Harris.<br> An actress?<br> Oh, yes. A child actress.<br> You ever hear the word "jailbait"?<br> That's the definition.<br> I'd watch it if I was you.<br> I value that, Mary.<br> Coming from you.<br> When America's Sweetheart gives<br> you advice, you'd better listen.<br> "Better listen?" Thanks, Charlie.<br> When here you're married and Doug<br> is married and you two are rutting...<br> ...pretending you've just met.<br> Mr. Chaplin, please?<br> Lecture me more about morality.<br> Bettah, Bettah.<br> Bettah. Bitch.<br> Better.<br> I washed my face.<br> Come here.<br> What is it?<br> I just need some...<br> you just need some lip rouge.<br> I've some in my purse.<br> It's in the drawer, over there.<br> Look at me.<br> Is this right?<br> Just put it on.<br> You weren't yet 30 and were<br> the most famous man in the world.<br> You had your own studio, named<br> after you. Couldn't you just enjoy?<br> I can, now.<br> I couldn't then. It meant too much.<br> Mr. Chaplin, welcome.<br> Can I take your picture?<br> Cut!<br> - Hold it.<br> Let's try a little less.<br> Hold the smoke.<br> The dirt, I mean.<br> Someone get me out of this thing.<br> Looks great, Charlie. I kept the boys<br> here till you got out of costume.<br> You are an ass!<br> - Thank you.<br> One more, Charlie?<br> How's the light? I know.<br> It's better down at Barney's Bar.<br> Call it a day.<br> I don't feel funny anymore.<br> - Let's go, Charlie.<br> Are you cheating, Fairbanks?<br> You are a truly strange fellow<br> Charles.<br> Nonsense.<br> Facts indicate otherwise.<br> Out.<br> These facts show a young man<br> of what, 29?<br> Not perhaps handsome<br> but certainly not repellent.<br> Flatteringly put.<br> Double fault. Lucky me.<br> A fellow of fame and fortune<br> not without talent.<br> Ready?<br> If only you'd put one in play.<br> Call this one out.<br> What for? I'm winning.<br> Damn.<br> Damn.<br> And who is he escorting?<br> Mildred Harris, that intellectual giant<br> of 16 who still sucks her thumb.<br> Very funny.<br> Then why aren't you laughing?<br> Because I'm marrying her.<br> She's really not that bad.<br> "Really not that bad"?<br> Spoken like a man desperately in love.<br> You're madder than I thought.<br> You sure it's yours?<br> I can only hope.<br> There are ways of getting out of this.<br> Where I come from<br> that's not an option.<br> Besides, I want a family...<br> You'll have one before you know it.<br> May I congratulate you?<br> You may not!<br> Good!<br> You didn't suspect about Mildred?<br> Not for a moment.<br> Why don't you add that? Put that in?<br> I'll never forget the night<br> Mary told me.<br> We were celebrating<br> the end of WW1.<br> I met J. Edgar Hoover<br> for the first time.<br> You should explain this was before<br> he became head of the FBI.<br> If I may continue, Mr. Hearst.<br> We're too generous.<br> We're too open.<br> If we don't watch out...<br> ...if we don't take steps now to impose<br> some new discipline, some decency...<br> ...then we're in trouble. Deep trouble.<br> It's not fashionable to say this.<br> We're celebrating, we think it's over.<br> But democracy carries a price tag.<br> I think one of the most misguided<br> promises we ever made...<br> ...was inscribed<br> on the Statue of Liberty.<br> One I predict will lead this country<br> into trouble.<br> "Give us your poor<br> your huddled masses."<br> We must stop this<br> before it goes too far.<br> Our concept of America<br> does not include...<br> ...never included this kind of scum.<br> You must forgive<br> our famous young friend...<br> ...his artistic temperament.<br> What you're saying is important.<br> We are giving sanctuary<br> to the refuse of the world.<br> Left-wing intellectuals<br> who want to bring us down.<br> Aren't you overstating?<br> No, I'm not.<br> Do you people realize<br> the responsibility you have?<br> To my way of thinking, movies...<br> ...are the most influential form<br> of communication ever invented.<br> And they're not controlled.<br> Your message<br> reaches people everywhere.<br> Message?<br> Of course.<br> Mr. Chaplin reaches millions<br> who only have to see.<br> And when they see our immigration<br> service mocked...<br> ...I call that a message.<br> As you've already said, Mr. Hoover...<br> ...movies are for the people.<br> Most people work for a living<br> and don't make very much.<br> It pleases them to see officials and the<br> upper class kicked on the backside.<br> Always have and it always will.<br> And if that can change things<br> so much the better.<br> Bettah.<br> He's improving.<br> But movies have made you rich.<br> They sure have.<br> I think you've handled it wonderfully.<br> Mildred.<br> The pregnancy?<br> Everyone knows you were conned.<br> Excuse us, Mr. Hearst.<br> I must be up early.<br> Come along, my dear.<br> You made an enemy there.<br> Was it personal, you think?<br> Personal? Maybe.<br> I'm sure he really believed<br> I was a communist.<br> I wasn't. I was simply a humanist.<br> He also believed you were a Jew.<br> Something I've rarely troubled<br> to deny, mainly because of Syd.<br> He's half-Jewish.<br> Same mother, different fathers.<br> I suppose the false pregnancy<br> was the end with Mildred.<br> You're so late again.<br> I'd almost given up.<br> Sometimes I feel I'm so close<br> to getting it right...<br> ...but it slips away.<br> You've been editing that film<br> for months.<br> Will be for months, more than likely.<br> Not like the old days.<br> The good times.<br> The good times? Are they over?<br> You want me to leave?<br> No.<br> I'll leave.<br> Why aren't you bitter towards her?<br> Stealing my movie wasn't her idea.<br> Poor child was so stupid<br> I doubt she could even spell "idea".<br> Wake up!<br> They're trying to seize the film.<br> Wash your face and wake up.<br> Sweet little bride of yours. Her divorce<br> lawyers say the film's an asset.<br> An asset?<br> I've got Rollie, the wife and 40<br> cans of film in the car. Come on.<br> Once we're out of the state<br> we'll finish cutting the film.<br> You've got<br> your pants on back to front.<br> It's good.<br> It moves now.<br> I really do love that kid.<br> Where's that shot, Syd?<br> Look in 102, Rollie.<br> Wait. I've got it, Chas.<br> Minnie, answer the door. Hurry.<br> Here's your tea.<br> - Thanks very much.<br> He's on to us, boys.<br> You are the honeysuckle<br> and I am the bee.<br> They're here, boss.<br> I've dreamed of this moment for years.<br> This is America.<br> It's where your dreams come true.<br> Charlie bought you a lovely house.<br> It's not too big.<br> - Great ocean view.<br> You always wanted to live by the see.<br> Don't stop Syd. You're right. I have.<br> I think I will love watching the waves.<br> I'm sure I will. You boys!<br> You spoil me so!<br> More tea?<br> The mark on my arm?<br> I got that at the asylum.<br> If I'd fed you proper<br> I'd never have gone there.<br> Now, if they ever come back for me<br> I'll have enough food for us all.<br> I could never deal with my mother.<br> I just threw money at her.<br> You have to explain why you chose<br> that time to go to London.<br> I was tired. I had a movie opening.<br> I wanted to see old friends.<br> Straight into the water, ass over tip!<br> He needed the job that bad!<br> But I was worried, Charlie.<br> I was prepared for the worst.<br> I've seen it happen<br> in the profession so many times.<br> I'm sure you have, Mr. Karno.<br> Head size. That's the only true<br> measure of a man.<br> I sent this lad to America.<br> Look what's come back to me.<br> My head never swelled<br> not with all my successes.<br> But I was worried about you, Charlie.<br> That night at the Troc, remember?<br> You took a tall suit from the<br> wardrobe and tried to be a gent.<br> Trying to impress that dancer<br> Hetty - wasn't that her name?<br> Hetty Kelly.<br> I could see that you fancied her.<br> Sad.<br> I know all about it. She got married.<br> She sent me a lovely note.<br> I've got it with me somewhere.<br> Oh, Charlie, Charlie.<br> Don't you know?<br> Has nobody told you? She's gone!<br> The flu epidemic after the war<br> carried her away.<br> I thought someone<br> must have told you.<br> Must have written.<br> Didn't nobody?<br> What will we do, Charlie?<br> Smile.<br> Give me my hat.<br> Hey! That's Charlie Chaplin!<br> What can I get you?<br> Light ale, please.<br> That'll be tuppence, sir.<br> There's someone who had a good war!<br> He wasn't in the army!<br> Come to stare at the animals, Charlie?<br> Give your mouth a rest, Ted.<br> I just came in for a quiet drink.<br> Good to see you.<br> Have one on me.<br> You have one on me.<br> Mr. Charlie fucking Chaplin!<br> Cheers! Bloody bastard!<br> Don't worry about him. He's always<br> been a miserable old sod.<br> Good luck!<br> - I've seen all your pictures!<br> That's Charlie Chaplin!<br> There's the back way, sir.<br> You're very kind.<br> Charles Chaplin in the Kid.<br> Welcome home, Charlie.<br> I knew then that I had no home. So I<br> decided to put down roots in America.<br> A man came to see me the other day.<br> A corset salesman? I sent him.<br> Your paunch needs help.<br> He was the FBI, old darling.<br> Said he knew I was a loyal American.<br> He wondered if everyone else<br> felt the same.<br> I let him work his way around to you...<br> ...which he did.<br> He asked if you were a member<br> of the Communist Party.<br> I said that was<br> an absolute impossibility.<br> Because I love America.<br> You were too cheap to pay the dues.<br> Remarkable. Your timing in work<br> is flawless. In life, it's the reverse.<br> You're a miserable pain in the ass.<br> But I'm worried about you.<br> Worry about your family jewels...<br> ...old darling.<br> I'm serious. Watch out.<br> For what?<br> You're a foreigner.<br> You're still an outsider.<br> You don't understand this country.<br> It's a good country underneath.<br> No. It's a good country on top.<br> Underneath is what starts showing<br> when we're scared.<br> But you don't care about politics.<br> What is this?<br> Why are you worried?<br> Me? I haven't a care in the world.<br> I'm the oldest action star around<br> and talkies are coming.<br> What have I got<br> to be worried about?<br> That's talkies, Charles.<br> Talkies!<br> Talkies!<br> Imagine the tramp talking.<br> It's the future, Charlie.<br> Not in my lifetime.<br> Talkies!<br> It'll never catch on.<br> Talkies!<br> We've enlarged it for you.<br> I still can't make him out.<br> Have you got a positive I. D?<br> It's Hawkins, sir. The red labor leader.<br> Visiting him in the studio.<br> How can we make them<br> realize the danger?<br> I told him that.<br> Face to face.<br> "You can damage this country".<br> He didn't get it.<br> How old is this one?<br> She's under age is all that matters.<br> We can go after him<br> for statuary rape.<br> The scandal will destroy him.<br> I appreciate your zeal.<br> But Chaplin and Miss Grey<br> were married yesterday.<br> If only he'd just sleep with them!<br> It would be so much easier.<br> Still...<br> ...we must do what we can.<br> Lita was your second wife. She gave<br> you two sons, whom you adored.<br> This book is over 500 pages long.<br> Yet only five lines to her. Why?<br> I hated the bitch.<br> She was hardly more than a child.<br> It can't all have been her fault.<br> She was a profoundly flawed<br> human being.<br> We must deal with the problem.<br> You married her.<br> All your life you bedded babies.<br> Readers will want to understand.<br> Where were you when she had those<br> two boys less than a year apart?<br> You know were I was. Making a little<br> film called "The Gold Rush".<br> You're a flawed human being<br> just like the rest of us.<br> Only, you have to address it.<br> I mean, why are we here talking<br> in Switzerland and not California?<br> It wasn't just the parlor pink<br> business or the speeches...<br> ...or the donations that finally turned<br> you into an exile.<br> Nah.<br> You know what it was?<br> Sex.<br> Yes. Sex.<br> It's odd, but I've never looked<br> at a woman...<br> ...without measuring that<br> possibility between us.<br> At the same time, I'm not that<br> interested - never during work.<br> I suppose it was only when I wasn't<br> working I was...<br> ...vulnerable.<br> Why don't you write about that?<br> If you want to understand me...<br> ...watch my movies.<br> Okay, sonny boy, tell your poor<br> little brother today's problem.<br> The same as yesterday.<br> And the day before<br> and the day before.<br> Fine. You be creative for a change.<br> The Tramp buys a flower from the girl.<br> For the plot to work<br> she has to think he's rich. That's all.<br> Except, of course, the girl is blind.<br> And I don't know how to make her<br> mistake him for a millionaire.<br> Easy.<br> We'll do what everyone else is doing.<br> Joe!<br> We'll have the actors talk.<br> Joseph Curb, Vitaphone.<br> Hello, sir.<br> Sorry. You're in the middle<br> of a family feud.<br> You decide who's right.<br> The Tramp can't talk.<br> The minute he talks, he's dead.<br> Tell me I'm right.<br> He can't, because you're wrong.<br> Who'll pay to see you<br> when everyone else uses sound?<br> I'll tell you who.<br> The Japanese and the Russkies...<br> Anyone who doesn't speak English.<br> Or did you forget about the other<br> Who's the most famous ballet dancer<br> in the world?<br> The most famous ballet dancer<br> in the world?<br> Nijinsky.<br> Fine. So let's say he was doing<br> "Swan Lake" today...<br> ...and we went to see it.<br> He comes down to the footlights.<br> The orchestra stops.<br> He says, "Hi, I'm Vaslav Nijinsky".<br> No, he'd have Russian accent.<br> "Hi, folksies. Call me Vaslav Nijinsky.<br> Just call me Vas"<br> "It's okay by me".<br> "Everything is wonderful".<br> "Today I'm going to jump up<br> and down for you".<br> "Hope you like me."<br> What would happen when he danced?<br> It would be awful.<br> Because the magic is gone.<br> As it would with the tramp.<br> Tell me I'm right.<br> I'm in the word business<br> so I have to say you're wrong.<br> But I'm glad I got to meet you.<br> Enjoyed the dancing?<br> Yeah. And the talking.<br> Take Mr. Curb to his office.<br> Rollie! Get them all back.<br> Syd, we're in business!<br> How does a blind girl mistake<br> a tramp for a rich man?<br> When she hears a door slam<br> on the rich man's car.<br> She thinks the tramp's the owner.<br> Easy. When you know how.<br> Boys!<br> Boys!<br> I'm taking your ball to the cellar.<br> I don't see any stairs.<br> Mum's here. Off you go!<br> Your mummy's here.<br> I'll see you next weekend.<br> Come on, off you go!<br> It can't be all that bad, Mr. Chaplin.<br> Do I know you?<br> And why don't I?<br> I'm Paulette Levy.<br> Would you like a drink?<br> I already have one.<br> A fur coat?<br> You look hungry.<br> Actress?<br> If you watch B movies and don't blink.<br> But don't get any ideas.<br> - You're taken.<br> No, but I'm twenty-one.<br> Way too old for you.<br> You're very pretty, Miss Levy.<br> I didn't get here<br> thanks to my Shakespeare reviews.<br> May I say something?<br> You'd be prettier as a brunette.<br> You'd be devastating<br> if you were 6 inches taller.<br> Punch? Two, please.<br> At least you can do something<br> about your hair.<br> Never! I was born this way.<br> Nice to see you again, sir.<br> Evening, Mr. Chaplin.<br> Sorry<br> I'm waiting for a natural blonde.<br> You look beautiful.<br> My usual table.<br> - Of course. Right this way.<br> You'd come a long way.<br> - Yes. My own suit.<br> No need to book a table.<br> I lived in luxury. But I was blind.<br> Blind?<br> Yes. That's fatal, for a storyteller.<br> Did I tell you I sold all my stocks<br> the year before the Crash?<br> That was clever.<br> It was deeply cruel, the Depression.<br> Can I have an autograph, Mr. Chaplin?<br> Yes, of course.<br> I wish they'd wanted my money.<br> You know what?<br> I've always had that gift.<br> After a man makes love to me<br> he just goes wild from happiness.<br> I am happy.<br> Then I don't want to be around<br> when you're sad.<br> Terrible things have happened<br> since the Crash.<br> Millions of Americans<br> have been robbed of work.<br> Machinery is replacing manpower.<br> And I've said nothing.<br> Shame on me.<br> Shame on me.<br> You're right, Charlie.<br> It's three seconds too short.<br> Okay, we'll do a two-bar repeat<br> of the xylophone.<br> Sorry, darling.<br> I'm taking the boys out today.<br> Why don't you come?<br> Tomorrow, darling.<br> Definitely tomorrow.<br> Put that in straight away.<br> What should we do?<br> - Change the key.<br> Let me hear it.<br> No. I'll tell you why.<br> Charlie, you were supposed<br> to meet us at the fight.<br> I'm sorry. Who was fighting?<br> Mostly Mary and Doug.<br> You're wonderful, Miss Goddard.<br> That didn't work either, did it?<br> The Fairbanks are getting a divorce.<br> Mussolini has invaded Abyssinia.<br> You really need a break, Charlie.<br> We should take a trip.<br> Good idea.<br> What's a good idea?<br> Around the world, I thought.<br> I'm not going to make it.<br> Did you lose your other wives<br> this way?<br> I think so.<br> But you'd have to ask them.<br> Paulette. She was wonderful.<br> Her personality, you mean?<br> In bed?<br> - No. Well, that was good.<br> She didn't take me for a fortune.<br> Let me help you. Come on.<br> Okay?<br> I know you so well. I know you're<br> thinking of Doug, aren't you?<br> I was the only one who knew.<br> Don't say I don't look after you.<br> Mr. Chaplin. Always a pleasure.<br> How are you?<br> You look even prettier.<br> Nobody's fine and everyone needs<br> a drink. Champagne, scotch?<br> Scotch.<br> Is he, uh...?<br> Yes.<br> Seriously?<br> His heart.<br> - Shit.<br> Hey. Don't laugh.<br> I'm testing for Scarlett.<br> Why should I laugh?<br> Because it's a joke.<br> Everyone's testing for Scarlett.<br> I hear Katie Hepburn has it locked<br> away. So they say.<br> I haven't worked<br> since "Modern Times."<br> Neither have I.<br> No ideas. I'm desperate.<br> See you later.<br> I can manage a double.<br> Should you?<br> Are you two still married or what?<br> I find it very confusing.<br> When people thought we were having<br> an affair, we were married.<br> Now people know<br> we're getting divorced.<br> You're a wizard with women<br> no question about it.<br> Who's that man? Sounds German.<br> - Looks German.<br> Probably one of those directors.<br> Maybe he has a job for me.<br> Like Plato, Adolf Hitler is defining<br> the ideal state to be a model...<br> ...for backward systems.<br> Do you know him?<br> I have that good fortune, yes.<br> And you have my word.<br> We only desire to defend our<br> historical frontiers.
