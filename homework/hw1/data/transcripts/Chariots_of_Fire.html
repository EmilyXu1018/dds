                        Let us praise famous men...<br> and our fathers that begat us.<br> All these men<br> were honoured in their generations<br> and were a glory in their days.<br> We are here today to give thanks<br> for the life of Harold Abrahams.<br> To honour the legend.<br> Now there are just two of us -<br> young Aubrey Montague<br> and myself -<br> who can close our eyes<br> and remember those few young men<br> with hope in our hearts<br> and wings on our heels.<br> Carlton Hotel, Broadstairs, Kent.<br> Dear Mum. I'm most awfully sorry about|your cold and the general dreariness.<br> We're also having|quite bad weather here, too.<br> Thanks for your letters.|I'm sorry you and Pa are disappointed<br> I should be letting the Olympic Games|interfere with my shorthand.<br> But if you were my age, with a chance|to win the World Championship in Paris,<br> you would be just as big a fool as I am.<br> By the way, it's awfully kind of Pa|to fnance me here, in spite of my idiocy.<br> It's marvellous for esprit de corps.|Most of the chaps have managed to get down.<br> - Cricket, Montague, in the ballroom.|- Now!<br> No ball!<br> Come on, Aubrey, the old leg break.<br> - Howzat!|- Not out.<br> What? You could hear it|in bloody Bournemouth!<br> - Come on, Liddell, my innings.|- I didn't touch it.<br> - You heard the crack of my wrist.|- I saw the bloody thing bend! Andy!<br> No tickle for me.<br> He's out, I tell you.|You're all deaf and bloody blind.<br> Aubrey, I ask you, for God's sake!<br> It's not fair!<br> All right.<br> Harold's here. As intense as ever.<br> Just as he was|on our very frst day at Cambridge.<br> I remember we shared a taxi together.<br> I'll take these.<br> - See you inside, Aubrey.|- Right.<br> Thank you.<br> - Name, please.|- We're new.<br> I can see that, laddie. What's your name?<br> Abrahams. HM.<br> - Top of the list. Repton. That the one?|- That's it. Left a year ago.<br> - Been doing your bit, 'ave you? France?|- No. Joined too late.<br> Bad luck, lad.<br> Many a dead man|would have liked a share of it.<br> You're right there, son.<br> Welcome to Caius.<br> - Sign here.|- Thank you.<br> It's across the courtyard,|top right-hand corner, up the stairs.<br> Thanks.<br> By the way, what are your names?<br> Rogers, head porter,|and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.<br> Well, Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe,<br> I ceased to be a "laddie" when|I took up the King's commission.<br> - Is that clear?|- Yes... Mr Abrahams.<br> - Quite clear.|- Thank you.<br> I'd be obliged if you'd remember it.<br> - See you later.|- Fine.<br> What's your friend studying, then, son?<br> Barrack-room law?<br> I've no idea.<br> One thing's certain.<br> A name like Abrahams, he won't be|in the chapel choir, now, will he?<br> - Name?|- Montague.<br> - What?|- Montague.<br> I take the war list<br> and I run down it.<br> Name after name, which I cannot read<br> and which we, who are older than you,<br> cannot hear without emotion.<br> Names which will be only names to you,<br> the new college.<br> But which to us summon up face after face,<br> full of honesty and goodness,<br> zeal and vigour<br> and intellectual promise.<br> The flower of a generation.<br> The glory of England,<br> and they died for England<br> and all that England stands for.<br> And now by tragic necessity,|their dreams have become yours.<br> Let me exhort you. Examine yourselves.<br> Let each of you discover<br> where your true chance of greatness lies.<br> For their sakes,<br> for the sake of your college|and your country, seize this chance.<br> Rejoice in it<br> and let no power or persuasion|deter you in your task.<br> Thursday, October 10th, 1919.<br> My frst day at Cambridge was rounded off<br> by the freshmen's dinner, a sumptuous affair.<br> The master gave us a moving speech<br> and I'm now eagerly awaiting|the start of term proper.<br> Rugby club, golfing society, tennis,<br> squash club, flora and fauna, philately.<br> Is that all? You're an idle man!<br> - I've got to work some time.|- Try bird-watching. You can take a book.<br> How can I watch if I'm reading a book?<br> Follow in the footsteps of WG.|Any Yorkshiremen here?<br> I can't bat for toffee.<br> # Upon the batle scene<br> # They fight the foe together<br> # There every mother's son<br> # Prepared to fight or fall is<br> # The enemy of one the enemy of all is<br> # The enemy of one the enemy of all is<br> - Abrahams, HM.|- Can you manage a tenor?<br> - We're desperately short of tenors.|- Only under torture.<br> - Aubrey. Sing, do you?|- School choir, that's all.<br> You, Stallard?<br> They kicked me out of Ring-a-ring o'Roses.<br> Sorry about that. We can't all be gifted.<br> # If everybody's somebody<br> # Then no one's anybody<br> - Put my friend here down as well.|- Steady on.<br> Splendid! Rehearsals start on Monday.|lolanthe.<br> - I was a boy alto.|- Perfect! You can be Queen of the Fairies.<br> Where were you|when your country needed you?<br> We have a duty, a solemn duty to those|millions of lives needlessly slaughtered!<br> # When the boys are far away<br> # They dream of home<br> Well, glad to have you, Stallard.<br> Good middle-distance men|don't grow on trees.<br> I can't vouch for those times.<br> Taken with the school alarm clock,|most of them.<br> Give or take a second,|they're good enough for me.<br> Have you come across a fellow|called Abrahams? HM Abrahams?<br> He's challenged for the college dash.<br> What's so special about that?<br> In all the 700 years, nobody's ever done it.<br> Right, what do you do?<br> Right, chaps, thank you! Thank you.<br> Let it be known that HM Abrahams|of Gonville and Caius<br> has formally made challenge|for the college dash.<br> You show 'em, Harold!<br> For those not familiar with the rules...<br> The challenger will atempt|to run around the court perimeter,<br> to and from a point beneath the clock,<br> within the time taken|by the clock to strike midday.<br> A distance traditionally|recognised as one of 188 paces.<br> I say, Abrahams, what have you got|on your feet? Rockets?<br> The challenge will commence on the...<br> - Abrahams, you haven't got a chance!|- Do it for Israel!<br> The challenge commences|on the stroke of one.<br> The challenger must finish|before the stroke of 12.<br> Come on, Abrahams, you swank!<br> Will the challenger make himself ready?<br> This Abrahams.|What do you know about him?<br> Repton chap.<br> Jewish.<br> - His father's a financier in the city.|- Financier?<br> What's that supposed to mean, I wonder?<br> I imagine he lends money.<br> Exactly.<br> And what do they say about the son?<br> Academically sound. Arrogant.<br> Defensive to the point of pugnacity.<br> As they invariably are.<br> Yet possessing|a keen sense of duty and loyalty.<br> Do they say he can run?<br> Like the wind.<br> Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?|Away from the course.<br> Thank you.<br> Mr Abrahams, your position, please.<br> Owing to the absence|of any other challenger,<br> Mr Abrahams will run alone.<br> Not so, Mr Starter!<br> Your name and college, if you please, sir.<br> Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.<br> We challenge in the name|of Repton, Eton and Caius.<br> - I didn't know you ran.|- Nor I you.<br> Some chap just told me about this.|I thought I'd come and push you along.<br> - Delighted.|- Splendid.<br> Good luck.<br> Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.<br> Now remember, on the first strike of 12.<br> Come on!<br> Eight!<br> Nine!<br> Ten!<br> - Eleven!|- Go on, Harold!<br> Did they both do it?<br> I think not.<br> - Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.|- Pity.<br> Well, it's been done. And by a Caius man!|You must be very proud.<br> The frst man in seven centuries.<br> Perhaps they really are|God's chosen people, after all.<br> I doubt if there's a swifter man|in the kingdom.<br> Get to your marks.<br> Get set.<br> He may be your best friend, Sandy,|but he's my best brother.<br> I'm thinking of him|and not your blessed athletics team.<br> His heart's set on following Father|in the mission.<br> Do you not think he's busy enough|without taking up racing?<br> He's fast, Jennie.|You've seen him with a ball in his hands.<br> I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.<br> And I know which is the most important.<br> You can't deny him the chance.<br> Get him on the track, I'm telling you...<br> Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.<br> Eric's special to me. Precious.<br> I don't want his work spoilt|with all this running talk, do you hear?<br> There you are. Well done.<br> You know, ladies and gentlemen,<br> one of the compensations|of achieving a certain notoriety,<br> if only as a rugby player,<br> is that occasionally|you're asked to give things away.<br> It's often said that giving beats receiving.<br> Let me tell you -<br> the look of delight|on those litle boys' faces<br> was worth ten of the tin pots gathering|dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.<br> When we were in China, my father here<br> was always waxing lyrical|about his wee home in the glen.<br> But being oriental-born myself,<br> like my brothers and my sister here,<br> I suffered from a natural incredulity.<br> But looking about me now -<br> the heather on the hills -<br> I can see he was right.<br> It's very special.<br> Thank you for welcoming us home.<br> And thank you<br> for reminding me that I am,|and will be whilst I breathe,<br> a Scot.<br> Mr Provost, sir.<br> Before you allow Eric here to go...<br> Is it not true that the main event|of the meeting is still to be run?<br> The 200-yards open championship.<br> It's the last event|of this gathering, by tradition.<br> Do you not think, if we can find him some kit,<br> we might persuade Scotland's|finest wing to show us his paces?<br> What do you say, Eric?<br> To your marks!<br> Get set!<br> Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?<br> Surely a touch of liberality|would do no harm.<br> Sandy, the kingdom of God|is not a democracy.<br> The Lord never seeks re-election.<br> There's no discussion, no deliberation,<br> no referenda as to which road to take.<br> There's one right, one wrong,<br> one absolute ruler.<br> - A dictator, you mean.|- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.<br> So much for your freedom of choice.<br> You've still got a choice, Sandy.<br> Nobody's forcing you to follow it.<br> - Do you know what day it is?|- Yeah.<br> - Tell me, then.|- Sunday.<br> The Sabbath's not a day|for playing football, is it?<br> No.<br> - Are you up early in the morning?|- Me ma gets me up at seven.<br> We'll have a game then, then. OK?<br> Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?<br> Sure. Bring your whole family.<br> I'll give ye a five-goal start.<br> You've got a train to catch at nine.<br> There's plenty of time.<br> Do you want the kid to grow up|thinking God's a spoilsport?<br> If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.<br> To the Liddell family,<br> whom I'm fortunate enough|to call my friends.<br> The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.<br> Bon voyage and safe journey back to China.<br> May the years ahead be happy and content.<br> For those who remain,|may God protect them,<br> inspire them<br> and lead them to glory.<br> Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.<br> I'm relying on you now|to keep them all out of mischief.<br> That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,|I'll pop the details on a postcard.<br> You can read all about it|before you can say Marco Polo.<br> Cost you a fortune in postage stamps.<br> Don't worry. I shall protect my investment.<br> I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.<br> We're going to have to watch ourselves.<br> You're a very lucky young man, Eric.<br> You're the proud possessor of many gifts.<br> And it's your sacred duty|to put them to good use.<br> Dad's right. Run like we know you can,|strong and true.<br> The mission cannot but gain|by your success.<br> What we need now is a muscular Christian.<br> To make folks sit up and notice.<br> How good are you, Eric?<br> Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland|before the month's out.<br> Then after that... the sky's the limit.<br> Meaning what?<br> The Olympic Games, maybe?<br> Eric, you can praise the Lord|by peeling a spud<br> if you peel it to perfection.<br> Don't compromise.|Compromise is a language of the devil.<br> Run in God's name<br> and let the world stand back in wonder.<br> # Lean and his mercy will provide<br> # Trust and thy trusting soul shall prove<br> # Christ is its life and Christ its love<br> # Run the straight race<br> # Through God's good grace<br> # Lift up thine eyes<br> # And seek his face<br> # Life with its way before us lies<br> You came to see a race today.<br> To see someone win.<br> It happened to be me.<br> But I want you to do more|than just watch a race.<br> I want you to take part in it.<br> I want to compare faith to running in a race.<br> It's hard.<br> It requires concentration of will.<br> Energy of soul.<br> You experience elation<br> when the winner breaks the tape,<br> especially if you've got a bet on it.<br> But how long does that last?<br> You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.<br> Maybe you haven't got ajob.<br> So who am I to say believe,<br> have faith, in the face of life's realities?<br> I would like to give you|something more permanent<br> but I can only point the way.<br> I have no formula for winning the race.<br> Everyone runs in her own way<br> or his own way.<br> And where does the power come from|to see the race to its end?<br> From within.<br> Jesus said,<br> "Behold, the kingdom of God is within you. "<br> "If with all your hearts ye truly seek me,<br> ye shall ever surely find me. "<br> If you commit yourself<br> to the love of Christ,<br> then that is how you run a straight race.<br> Cheers. Thanks for coming.<br> It's an ache.<br> A helplessness.<br> And an anger.<br> One feels humiliated.<br> Sometimes I say to myself,|"Steady on, you're imagining all this. "<br> Then I catch that look again.<br> Catch it on the edge of a remark.<br> Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.<br> That's my father.<br> A Lithuanian Jew.<br> He is alien.<br> - He's as foreign as a frankfurter.|- A kosher one at that!<br> I love and admire him.<br> He worships this country.<br> From nothing, he built what he believed<br> was enough to make|true Englishmen of his sons.<br> My brother's a doctor.<br> A leader in his field.<br> - Which one is he?|- That's me with the curls, on his back.<br> He wanted for nothing.<br> And here am I.<br> Setting up shop|in the fnest university in the land.<br> But the old man forgot one thing.<br> This England of his is Christian<br> and Anglo-Saxon.<br> And so are her corridors of power.<br> And those who stalk them|guard them with jealousy and venom.<br> You're right to study law.|You're quite an advocate.<br> A rare ethnic advantage.|It's called the gift of the gab.<br> So what now? Grin and bear it?<br> No, Aubrey.<br> I'm going to take them on. All of them.<br> One by one.<br> And run them off their feet.<br> # He is an Englishman!<br> # He is an Englishman<br> # For he himself has said it<br> # And it's greatly to his credit<br> # That he is an Englishman<br> England beckons for sprint blue.<br> From a special correspondent.<br> Clean sweep for Cambridge star.<br> Abrahams hat trick.<br> From a special correspondent.<br> # But in spite of all temptations<br> # To belong to other nations<br> # He remains an Englishman<br> # He remains an<br> # Englishman<br> # For in spite of all temptations<br> # To belong to other nations<br> # He remains an Englishman<br> # He remains an<br> # Englishman<br> Bravo!<br> Bravo, Harold!<br> What are you asking?<br> 25 Liddell to win.<br> Mr Mussabini, I believe.<br> My name's Keddie. Colonel John Keddie.<br> - I'm...|- President of the Scotish Three A's.<br> I know and I'm glad to know you, sir.<br> - How's the leg?|- OK.<br> Nasty fall you took.<br> Enchant. Good luck.<br> You're very welcome here, of course.<br> But we do have a strict amateur code.<br> Colonel, don't worry your head.<br> I'm here spectating, that's all.<br> Ah, good. I felt sure you would understand.<br> Well, to batle!<br> I hope you enjoy the games.<br> Games?

I would, deeply.<br> Good. I was sure of it.<br> Here in Cambridge, we've always|been proud of our athletic prowess.<br> We believe, we've always believed,|that our games are indispensable<br> in helping to complete|the education of an Englishman.<br> They create character.<br> They foster courage, honesty and leadership.<br> But most of all,|an unassailable spirit of loyalty,<br> comradeship and mutual responsibility.<br> - Would you agree?|- Yes, sir. I would.<br> I'm afraid there is a growing suspicion|in the bosom of this university -<br> and I tell you this without in any way<br> decrying your achievements,|in which we all rejoice -<br> that in your enthusiasm for success<br> you have perhaps lost sight|of some of these ideals.<br> May I ask what form|this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?<br> - Oh, hardly betrayal!|- The word grief was mentioned.<br> It's said that you use a personal coach.<br> Mr Mussabini, yes.<br> - Is he Italian?|- Of Italian extraction, yes.<br> - I see.|- But not all Italian.<br> - I'm relieved to hear it.|- He's half Arab!<br> Do we take it that you employ this|Mr Mussambini on a professional basis?<br> Sam Mussabini is the finest, most advanced,<br> clearest-thinking athletics coach|in the country.<br> I'm honoured to be worthy of his atention.<br> Nevertheless, he's a professional.<br> What else would he be? He's the best.<br> Ah, but there, Mr Abrahams,|I'm afraid our paths diverge.<br> You see, this university believes|that the way of the amateur<br> is the only one to provide|satisfactory results.<br> I am an amateur.<br> You're being trained by a professional.<br> You've adopted a professional atitude.<br> For the past year, you have concentrated|on developing your own technique<br> in the headlong pursuit,|may I suggest, of individual glory.<br> Not a policy very conducive to|the fostering of esprit de corps.<br> I am a Cambridge man first and last.<br> I am an Englishman first and last.<br> What I have achieved, what I intend|to achieve, is for my family,<br> my university and my country.<br> And I biterly resent|your suggesting otherwise.<br> Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?<br> At all costs, no.|But I do aim to win within the rules.<br> Perhaps you would rather|I played the gentleman and lost?<br> To playing the tradesman, yes.<br> My dear boy, your approach has been,|if I may say so, a litle too plebeian.<br> You are the lite<br> and are therefore expected to behave as such.<br> Thank you, sir,<br> for your hospitality.<br> The evening has been most illuminating.<br> Good night to you, sir.<br> You know, gentlemen,<br> you yearn for victory, just as I do.<br> But achieved with|the apparent effortlessness of gods.<br> Yours are the archaic values|of the prep school playground.<br> You deceive no one but yourselves.<br> I believe in the pursuit of excellence...<br> and I'll carry the future with me.<br> Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.<br> A different god.<br> A different mountain top.<br> Harold!

Lord Lindsay.<br> Your Highness, Cadogan, gentlemen.<br> I do apologise for barging in like this.<br> The fact is|I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.<br> I wondered if I could be so bold|as to suggest a possible solution.<br> Do.<br> Yes.<br> Another day, another race.<br> What the devil's that supposed to mean?<br> It's quite simple as a mater of fact, sir.<br> The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.<br> I've already got my medal.<br> So why don't you let Eric|take my place in the quarter?<br> I think that's a splendid idea.<br> Can we allow him to change events|at such short notice?<br> That's a mater for the commitee.<br> We are the commitee.<br> I think it's a very good idea.<br> David?<br> All those in favour say aye.<br> Aye.<br> Liddell?<br> - Andy, I...|- A pleasure, old chap.<br> Just to see you run.<br> Aye.<br> Well, that's setled.<br> A sticky moment, George.<br> Thank God for Lindsay.|I thought the lad had us beaten.<br> He did have us beaten, FE.<br> - And thank God he did.|- I don't quite follow you.<br> The lad, as you call him,|is a true man of principle<br> and a true athlete.<br> His speed is a mere extension|of his life, its force.<br> We sought to sever his running|from himself.<br> For his country's sake, yes.<br> No sake is worth that, FE.<br> Least of all a guilty national pride.<br> Lindsay makes way for Liddell.<br> "Smacks of fanaticism," says official.<br> "Man of principle," says primate.<br> "We should be proud.
