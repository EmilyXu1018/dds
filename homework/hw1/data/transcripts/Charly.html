                        Goethe saw that it was Faust's<br> relentless search for objectives...<br> In the end, Faust was saved<br> because he ceaselessly strove...<br> for the goal he had never obtained.<br> That's very good, Mrs. Gardner.<br> "Go to night school." It's very good.<br> There's only one thing wrong.<br> It's the word "night."<br> I know it sounds like N-l-T-E.<br> But we spell it...<br> N-l-G-H-T.<br> Night. Okay?<br> I can never get that one word, that "school."<br> - That's wrong, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> It's S-C-H-O-O-L, Charly, not S-K.<br> S-C-H-O-O-L.<br> Okay, everybody.<br> Next Wednesday, we study through Page 20.<br> Good night.<br> I should like you to work very hard.<br> Whenever you can...<br> You must come next Wednesday.<br> - Every week, okay?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Good night, Miss Kinnian.<br> Charly, we missed you.<br> At the clinic.<br> The doctors wanted to do some tests.<br> Yeah. Well, I forgot.<br> I went to the library.<br> I've never seen so many books in my life.<br> Don't forget the clinic tomorrow night.<br> No. I'm gonna write it down<br> on my blackboard twice, I promise.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Miss Kinnian.<br> Hello, darling. Thanks for waiting for me.<br> Good night.<br> For instance, apples and pears.<br> They're both alike<br> because they're both fruit.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay, we'll begin. Shoes and gloves.<br> Charly, shoes and gloves.<br> - My rabbit's foot.<br> - That's good, Charly.<br> Shoes...<br> Shoes, gloves.<br> Shoes and gloves.<br> - You wear them.<br> - That's right.<br> Airplane, automobile.<br> Airplane...<br> Automobile.<br> You ride in them.<br> Morning, afternoon.<br> Charly, you don't have to worry<br> about passing or failing. Not these tests.<br> That's a very funny face, Charly.<br> Charly, I'm going to<br> show you some pictures.<br> Look at me.<br> What happened in this picture?<br> What do you see?<br> - Is there something missing?<br> - No.<br> I want you to make up a story<br> about these people.<br> I can't make up a story...<br> - About people I don't know, Miss Kinnian.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> You can make-believe.<br> Make up a story.<br> Is that a family?<br> That's a family.<br> Who is this?<br> - That's a father.<br> - Right.<br> If that is the father, then who is this?<br> That's a mother.<br> If that is the mother...<br> Do you remember your mother?<br> Yeah, sometimes I remember her.<br> I think I remember her.<br> Sitting on the edge of a bed...<br> putting her hand on my head and saying,<br> "He's burning up."<br> But, then, maybe...<br> that was a woman at the institute,<br> I don't know.<br> Probably a woman at the institute.<br> Charly!<br> It's 5:00, Charly.<br> Forgot what you have to do?<br> Finish the floor.<br> Come on, Charly, think.<br> You were gonna take something home.<br> Yeah.<br> For a minute there, Charly,<br> you had me worried.<br> You're always thinking such deep thoughts.<br> How you gonna remember a little thing<br> like your landlady's birthday?<br> Yeah, Mrs. Apple is gonna be real happy.<br> And thanks for making me remember, Gimp.<br> What are pals for, Charly?<br> Give me the broom.<br> Me and the boys will help you clean up.<br> - Right, fellas?<br> - Right!<br> Come on, Charly.<br> Gimp, what gives?<br> We filled his pail with raw dough<br> this morning, full of yeast.<br> It growed. It got big.<br> It growed. It got big.<br> Yeah, Charly again.<br> He has a marvelous opportunity.<br> Is that a him or a her?<br> - We call him Algernon.<br> - Algernon.<br> - Please, set up Number Four.<br> - All right. You can take it away now.<br> Now, you come, Charly,<br> and I'll show you something.<br> Okay, dear. See you at 9:00. Bye.<br> Doctor, why are you using the mouse test?<br> We're simply using a laboratory animal,<br> Mrs. Kinnian...<br> to spur the subject on to his best effort.<br> Now you and Algernon<br> are going to run a race.<br> Well, I can beat him<br> 'cause I'm bigger than he is.<br> It's not that kind of race.<br> - Charly, what does this look like?<br> - It's a puzzle.<br> Very good, that's right. Now watch.<br> We put Algernon in here to start.<br> Then we put some food in here,<br> at the finish.<br> And Algernon knows<br> he must find his way through the puzzle...<br> if he wants to get the food.<br> - And if he don't?<br> - Then he doesn't get to eat it.<br> He don't?<br> Don't worry, Charly. He won't go hungry.<br> Now, Charly...<br> this is a diagram.<br> Diagram? It's exactly the same<br> as Algernon's puzzle.<br> You'll take this pencil and draw...<br> from the start to the finish...<br> without going through any of the lines.<br> You'll start at the same time<br> Algernon does...<br> and we'll see who gets through first.<br> Do you understand, Charly?<br> Ready?<br> Start.<br> Very good.<br> He beat me.<br> He beat me. I didn't know mice are so smart.<br> Come on, Charly, cheer up.<br> How would you feel<br> if you was dumber than a mouse?<br> Good night, Miss Kinnian.<br> Charly, aren't you gonna ask me up?<br> I've never once seen your apartment.<br> I'd like to see it.<br> - Well, it's just a room.<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> It's upstairs.<br> Can you imagine, Monty?<br> Charly Gordon with a girl.<br> He better have her out by 10:00.<br> There will be no hokey-pokey in my house.<br> - It's just a room, Miss Kinnian.<br> - It's very nice.<br> Who are they?<br> That's Gimpy and the guys at the bakery.<br> They are my best friends.<br> Charly, may I have a glass of water, please?<br> Yeah. Would you...<br> - Would you like a soda pop?<br> - Yeah. That will be fine.<br> - How about you?<br> - No, that's okay.<br> - Would you like to sit down?<br> - Yeah, I would.<br> Grab a chair.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll sit in this chair.<br> It's little, but it's good.<br> I had a radio but it got busted.<br> - Charly?<br> - Yeah?<br> Can you keep a secret?<br> Yeah. I'm a good secret keeper.<br> That mouse you raced today.<br> Yeah, that Algernon.<br> He was very special.<br> He had an operation.<br> When it was over, he was smarter.<br> The doctors are ready<br> to try that operation on a man.<br> They're ready to choose someone now.<br> That's why you had all those tests.<br> Well, they should have told me.<br> I would have tried harder.<br> - Would you like an operation like that?<br> - Yeah.<br> Why?<br> I'd like to be smarter...<br> so that I could understand Gimpy<br> and the fellas at the bakery.<br> There's a lot of their words<br> I don't understand.<br> Just so I could get a little closer, you know.<br> I think we can get you<br> to race Algernon again.<br> I don't know.<br> Algernon is a smart little mouse.<br> Ready now? Start.<br> Take it easy. You ready? Start.<br> Well, here are the results.<br> His Performance IQ is 59...<br> Verbal 69, Full Scale 70.<br> Too low, at least for our first subject.<br> We have other retardates...<br> who might be more suitable.<br> I've never met one<br> who has Charly's motivation.<br> He came all by himself for two years<br> to night school...<br> to try to improve his reading.<br> That's all very well, Mrs. Kinnian.<br> But I think...<br> Isn't it true that the average retardate<br> is overly sensitive and sometimes hostile?<br> In Charly's working environment...<br> he is the butt of all kinds of jokes,<br> some of them cruel...<br> yet he always remains<br> cheerful and pleasant.<br> The fact remains he's a grown man.<br> Doctor, is the operation dangerous?<br> It need not involve<br> any unusual surgical risk.<br> It's the postoperative period<br> we're concerned about.<br> The younger our subject...<br> the less complicated<br> his emotional adjustment is apt to be.<br> There is one point in Charly's favor.<br> Mrs. Kinnian.<br> Whoever we decide on will have to be<br> put in an accelerated learning program.<br> He'll need a full-time teacher.<br> Somebody with Mrs. Kinnian's background,<br> even more important...<br> someone he trusts.<br> Would you be available?<br> My fiance and I were planning to work...<br> on a joint thesis for our doctorates.<br> Well, at the moment,<br> it's all hypothetical anyway.<br> Of course.<br> - Thank you, Mrs. Kinnian.<br> - Thank you, Doctor.<br> Come on, Charly. Let's go.<br> Yeah, just one more, Miss Kinnian.<br> Not quite.<br> You sure are a smart mouse, Algernon.<br> Good night, Bert.<br> - Good night, Bert.<br> - Take it easy, Charly.<br> Good night, Algernon.<br> That Father Callahan now. Take him, Monty.<br> He's one of that new breed of liberal priests.<br> It's no wonder the younger generation<br> are selling their souls to the devil.<br> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Welcome to the historical tour of Boston.<br> This is the Charles River Basin where<br> amateur yachtsmen can sail 365 days a year.<br> In the late afternoon,<br> you can see the sculling crews of Harvard...<br> MIT, and other universities,<br> practicing for their annual races.<br> On the left is the Prudential Center.<br> The Prudential Tower, 52 stories high...<br> is the tallest building<br> in the continental United States...<br> if you consider Manhattan Island<br> outside the continental United States.<br> Here's Bunker Hill Monument.<br> Stands 220 feet tall,<br> It'll take you approximately 2o minutes<br> to walk up, 15 minutes to come down...<br> and 10 days to get over it.<br> The Boston-Cambridge area has a total<br> of 189 universities and small colleges.<br> We are now going through<br> Boston University...<br> which includes a School of Law,<br> a School of Political Science...<br> a School of Philosophy,<br> a School of Accounting...<br> a School of Nursing,<br> a School of Business Administration...<br> a School of Fine Arts, and many others.<br> As we make a right-hand turn,<br> look to your left.<br> You'll see the Boston Public Library.<br> The third oldest library in America.<br> There's over 2 million volumes<br> in its collection.<br> On your far left is the Old South Church.<br> As we make a right-hand turn<br> on Boston Street, look to your right.<br> You will see Trinity Church,<br> founded in 1877...<br> designed by Henry Hobson Richardson.<br> Phillip Brooks was pastor of this church<br> for 22 consecutive years.<br> While being pastor,<br> he was made Bishop of Massachusetts.<br> Most of you people remember Phillip Brooks<br> by his famous church hymns.<br> One of the most famous Christmas carols,<br> O Little Town of Bethlehem.<br> We'll make a brief stop in South Boston,<br> to discharge a passenger.<br> - See you next Sunday, Charly.<br> - Okay.<br> - Come on, Charly, just one beer.<br> - No, I can't. Not tonight, Gimp.<br> - I bet you're gonna see that school teacher.<br> - Boy, could I give her a lesson.<br> - I didn't think you went for broads.<br> - Sure I do.<br> What do you do with her?<br> I promised her.

Charly.<br> I've been meaning to talk to you.<br> Could you step in here, please?<br> Monty. That nice Charly Gordon<br> is coming to visit.<br> You say, a cage. A pet mouse?<br> Yeah, but I ain't gonna race him.<br> Come in here for a minute.<br> Sit down, Charly.<br> Don't sit on Monty.<br> Sit down, Charly.<br> - Charly.<br> - Yeah.<br> Having a pet is a gift from God.<br> - Isn't that right, Monty?<br> - I don't know, Miss Apple.<br> Don't argue with me, young man.<br> I'm telling you.<br> This little mouse is a blessing in disguise.<br> First of all, a pet keeps you company.<br> They don't talk back.<br> They're loyal and loving.<br> They are truly man's best friend.<br> A little animal is one of God's creatures.<br> They live only to comfort you.<br> Now, Charly, you go right back up there,<br> and you make up with him.<br> Tell him you'll feed him...<br> clean his cage and give him water.<br> That's all he wants. That, and your love.<br> And in return,<br> he'll give you many happy hours.<br> Monty, why don't we give Charly...<br> one of your bones,<br> to give to the little mouse?<br> Would you mind?<br> I don't know if mice<br> are carnivorous or vegetarious.<br> Anyway, Charly, here you are.<br> - What are you going to call him?<br> - They call him Algernon.<br> You and Algernon are welcome down here<br> at any time.<br> Thank you, Miss Apple.<br> Algernon.<br> What do you think of that, Montgomery?<br> Hi, Alg.<br> Wanna race?<br> You ready, pal?<br> Go.<br> I beat you.<br> I beat him!<br> I beat him!<br> Professor, Dr. Straus, Miss Kinnian!<br> I beat him!<br> Charly!<br> Miss Kinnian, I beat him.<br> I was in the room... They put...<br> Somebody... A mouse...<br> I got the wrapper, and I spelt "school."<br> I put him, and I beat him.<br> I creamed him!<br> Miss Kinnian, what happens now?<br> Punctuate it.<br> Go ahead, punctuate it.<br> Now, I got something all made up for you<br> to punctuate.<br> Punctuate that.<br> That does not make sense.<br> "That, that is...<br> "is.<br> "That, that is not...<br> "is not."<br> "Is that it?"<br> "It is."<br> Student surpasses the teacher.<br> - Mrs. Kinnian.<br> - Yes.<br> Where's Mr. Kinnian?<br> He died.<br> Are you in love with Frank?<br> Tomorrow's studies.<br> Basic chemistry.<br> - Good night, Charly.<br> - Good night, Miss Kinnian.<br> This is the Capitol of the United States.<br> Our government is divided<br> into three branches.<br> The Executive, the Legislative,<br> and the Judicial.<br> What are the two legislative branches<br> of Congress called?<br> Turn off the teaching machine to answer.<br> House of Representatives and Senate.<br> You are looking at a film of one of<br> our country's most significant events.<br> Who are these men? Why are they here?<br> What did they do almost 2oo years ago,<br> that affects your life today?<br> Those men are getting ready...<br> to sign the Declaration of Independence,<br> and declare our country...<br> free from England.<br> And I'm getting ready for work.<br> - Hey, Charly.<br> - Yeah?<br> - You know what day it is?<br> - I don't know, Gimp.<br> We aren't keeping you awake, are we?<br> Is it that chick? Just won't let you alone?<br> - It's April Fools' Day. That's what day it is.<br> - His birthday.<br> The English Constitution.<br> - Hey, Gimp.<br> - Yeah?<br> - You know what a Magna Carta is?<br> - That's a cigar, isn't it?<br> Come on, Hank. I need that.<br> You really know all this stuff in here?<br> Or are you just looking at pictures?<br> I know some of it.<br> Hell, Charly, you're so smart that...<br> Yeah, why not. Here.<br> - See this machine?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You know what it is?<br> - It's a machine that you work.<br> How would you like to work it?<br> - Gimp, you kidding?<br> - What do you mean, kidding, Joey?<br> Man knows what the Magna Carta is.<br> He'd be able to operate<br> a simple machine like a pastry mixer.<br> It took you two weeks learning how.<br> That's a very complicated machine.<br> Not for Charly. Come in here closer.<br> Look, this is all you got to do.<br> Step number one.<br> You turn on your water. See?<br> Make sure the temperature<br> is 78 degrees, okay?<br> Then we come over here<br> and set our water pressure at 1 40 pounds.<br> See that, right there.<br> Set it back and turn on the water switch.<br> You got this now, right?<br> Now we follow our fresh water<br> along that line to that valve, see?<br> Excuse me, Joey. I wanna get up there.<br> We come up here...<br> and we open up our flour hopper.<br> Lets our flour down here.<br> You mix it with the water, okay?<br> Come over here.<br> Open up our bowl.<br> I want you to get a look at this dough.<br> Then we start up our agitator.<br> This stirs up the dough inside.<br> Okay, see it? All right.<br> Then we close it up.<br> Now comes a very important thing.<br> These timing switches.<br> Set your timing switches.<br> They're very important. Don't forget these.<br> Now, Charly, you put all this together,<br> and it comes out dough.<br> - What do you say?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Suppose he breaks it?<br> - Then we get the day off.<br> April Fools' Day.<br> Watch it!<br> Watch Charly.<br> - Charly, that was perfect.<br> - Great. I love that.<br> You couldn't have done better than that.<br> Mrs. Kinnian. Come here, quick.<br> There's a whole new world in it. Look at it.<br> - It's exciting?<br> - Yeah.<br> Let's see if you can identify...<br> the activity in each of these slides.<br> Is he in love with you?<br> Frank.<br> I'd rather not discuss my personal life,<br> if you don't mind.<br> Not that there is anything secret about it<br> or even unusual.<br> It has nothing to do<br> with your program of learning.<br> - First slide.<br> - I got a birthday present.<br> - It's not my birthday.<br> - It's not for you.<br> Algernon.<br> It's his birthday cheese.<br> What makes you think it's his birthday?<br> How do you know it's not?<br> That's true. Happy birthday, Algernon.<br> Happy birthday, Algernon.<br> It's very nice of you, Charly.<br> Well, he's very special.<br> Nice paintings. Now, Judy, what...<br> I painted a house.<br> Isn't that nice, dear?<br> And what is your... Mrs. Kinnian.<br> That's nice that you came.<br> Dean, would you be good enough<br> and go over to Cathy?<br> Play with the pumpkins.<br> You can sit down, Mrs. Kinnian.<br> Would you do it, Dean, please?<br> Thank you so much. Thanks a lot.<br> That's nice what you've painted, Dean.<br> - Look what I made.<br> - It's so bright.<br> I got your letter, Mrs. Kinnian.<br> I'm afraid I can't accept your reasons.<br> I'm holding him back.<br> He knows the answers and questions<br> before I even open the book.<br> - And?<br> - And what?<br> You seem tense. Is it that important<br> for you to resign from this project?<br> I gave you my reasons.<br> Which I must reject. You are a psychologist.<br> You know that Charly has made<br> a transference...<br> and at this point,<br> is completely dependant upon you.<br> He's involved with you emotionally.<br> That's normal, isn't it?<br> And you are involved with him emotionally?<br> Why do you ask that?<br> - I am engaged, you know.<br> - I met your fiance.<br> Very charming.<br> How long have you been engaged?<br> I'll stay until the convention, Doctor.<br> No longer.<br> I've got to go.<br> Bye-bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye-bye, Mrs. Kinnian.<br> Faneuil Hall. Built in the early 1 7 40s...<br> and given to the city by the merchant<br> Peter Faneuil.<br> It burned in 1 761 but was rebuilt.<br> It's still in use as a market, a meeting place.<br> Why is it known as the Cradle of Liberty?<br> If we'd walked in there, say in 1 77 4...<br> whom might we have met<br> attending a meeting of protest?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> The next stop along the Freedom Trail<br> is the North Church.<br> Built 1 723.<br> Boston's oldest church.<br> For what historic incident<br> is North Church known?<br> I'm sorry, I didn't...<br> What happened here that became part<br> of our national heritage?<br> Two lanterns in the steeple<br> signaled Paul Revere...<br> that British were on their way to Concord.<br> Right. Any questions?<br> I was wondering why people...<br> that would never dream<br> of laughing at a blind or crippled man...<br> would laugh at a moron.<br> What happened?<br> My friends at the bakery got up a petition,<br> and I got fired.<br> Is that an automatic law,<br> something like gravity?<br> Increased intelligence equals lost friends.<br> You needn't worry about losing your job.<br> The doctors want you to work full-time<br> at the clinic...<br> studying, learning, and getting paid, too.<br> Will you be there all the time?<br> Yes. I imagine so.<br> At least until the convention.<br> The doctors have been asked<br> to head a symposium.<br> The annual meeting of the<br> Society for Cerebral Research.<br> I suspect you and Algernon<br> are scheduled to be their prime exhibits.<br> What will we have to do?<br> Maybe speak a foreign language...<br> do an exercise in neo-Boolean math.<br> Both of us?<br> George Bernard Shaw wrote<br> something once...<br> Pass the ketchup, please.<br> - I didn't know he wrote that.<br> - What?<br> Pass The Ketchup, Please.<br> - Here's your chowder, sir.<br> - It's the lady's.<br> No, seriously.<br> Thank you.<br> He said, "Whenever you learn something,<br> it seems at first...<br> "as if you've lost something."<br> A whole universe is opening up for you.<br> It's a world that's always been there...<br> but not for you. Not till now.<br> Cream, please.<br> Now you're growing,<br> and growth causes pain.<br> You do your job very well.<br> Bert, please.<br> Are you quite certain of your evaluation<br> of Charly's Rorschach tests?<br> There's no question in my opinion.<br> Thank you.<br> Once the initial breakthrough occurred...<br> subject completed all elementary<br> school work in five weeks.<br> A capacity speed-up occurred<br> during the high school phase.<br> And all this work was accomplished<br> in three weeks.<br> Instructions were then accelerated.<br> You have been pushing him much too hard.<br> Subject made the leap from rote<br> memorization to a grasp of abstract theory.<br> The next step was attaining insightful<br> function and the ability to restructure.<br> - Subsequently...<br> - Richard.<br> May I please have your attention?<br> Emotionally, he's still a child.<br> Frightened. Insecure.<br> Look at these drawings...<br> I've had him do.<br> They are representative of the last...<br> two months.<br> - Each one progressively more disturbed.<br> - Disturbed?<br> He likes to paint.<br> He still can't believe he's being paid to do<br> nothing but learn, paint, and improve.<br> But can't you see?<br> I cautioned you about this before.<br> These aren't disturbed.<br> They are more sophisticated.<br> More abstract than the ones he did<br> a couple of months ago.<br> You go right on ignoring even the evidence.<br> Come.<br> Anna, I don't think we should interrupt<br> his studies.<br> Thymine, guanine and cytosine.<br> Structure of the insulin molecule.<br> Double-chain, 51 amino acids...<br> employing 17 basic aminos<br> cross-linked by sulfur atoms.<br> What metal and what gas<br> would you combine...<br> - In order to convert heat into...<br> - Electricity? Tantalum and cesium vapor.<br> Yes.<br> What is the technique called<br> the algebra of...<br> What are you trying to turn him into?<br> - Some kind of side-show freak?<br> - Don't be ridiculous.<br> You're pushing your program for his<br> intellectual development too rapidly.<br> It has to keep pace with my program<br> for his emotional development...<br> or the imbalance will become dangerous.<br> I thought we were to be satisfied<br> with a minor miracle...<br> - What are you afraid of?<br> ...help a retarded human being...<br> become a more productive member<br> of society.<br> He has shown no indication<br> of any mental ceiling.<br> So why are you afraid to reach<br> for whatever that ceiling may be?<br> In any event, we shall have to give<br> Mrs. Kinnian her notice.<br> What?<br> All she can do now is ask him questions<br> out of books that he's already absorbed.<br> What he needs at this point<br> is a giant step forward.<br> New conceptualization. Inductive thinking.<br> That calls for experts, not Alice Kinnian.<br> I will say it once more, Richard.<br> Charly Gordon is still a child emotionally.<br> I don't agree.<br> Yes?<br> Charly, what is it?<br> I brought you a present.<br> Okay, come in.<br> Very nice of you.<br> What's the occasion?<br> I just wanted you to have a present.<br> Sit down.<br> Lovely paper.<br> Charly, it's so beautiful.<br> Must have been terribly expensive.<br> You like it?<br> It's beautiful but it's too much.<br> Just beautiful. Thank you.<br> He only kissed you on the cheek.<br> He?<br> Frank.<br> Have you been spying on me?<br> I've been falling in love with you.<br> No.<br> These feelings aren't what you think.<br> It isn't love...<br> We have fun working together...<br> but you have to understand that between...<br> You think anyone would ever want you?<br> You stupid moron!<br> I saw your cycle outside.<br> It's for sale.<br> What did you learn?<br> I'm back.<br> What did you learn?<br> I'm here.<br> - Marry me, Alice.<br> - Charly...<br> I could never keep up with you,<br> and I don't want to hold you back.<br> - And I don't want to be left behind.<br> - Einstein had a wife.<br> Didn't Einstein say...<br> that everything was in motion,<br> that nothing ever stands still?<br> Marry me, pretty girl, marry me.<br> We will marry at quarter past Wednesday...<br> on the 7 4th of November...<br> and our anniversary will happily be...<br> on those days when we both remember.<br> Ever been anywhere?<br> Someday.<br> Portugal is straight ahead.<br> I can smell the olives.<br> Ship ahoy.<br> Abandoned schooner off the starboard bow.<br> Want to ship out?<br> Okay, where are the sails?<br> Who needs sails?<br> As captain of this ship,<br> I now declare us man and wife.<br> I signed on only as first mate.<br> You know what's going to happen<br> in the year 2o18?<br> I'm never gonna let this year end.<br> It will be our golden wedding anniversary.<br> Charly, let's worry about breakfast.<br> Think Algernon has found a wife?<br> Or his true love.<br> The plural of mouse is mice.<br> The plural of spouse must be spice?<br> They say, Charly...<br> that true love...<br> is letting go.<br> What's enough love?<br> Always a little more...<br> than anyone ever gets.<br> Please, could we stop<br> these recriminations...<br> and use the time to decide<br> tomorrow's program?<br> All right, you still really believe<br> he'll be here?<br> But, of course. You were on the extension,<br> you heard them...<br> How do we know what's happened<br> to Charly in the past four weeks?<br> Whether he's learned more or not?<br> We have no immediate evaluation...<br> May we concentrate on the presentation?<br> All right, what are your ideas<br> on the programming?<br> How much time shall we program<br> for Algernon and the Phase 5 mice?<br> I thought we agreed to eliminate<br> that part of the presentation.<br> No, I did not agree to that.<br> It is essential to show the entire graph<br> of Algernon's various stages.<br> In my opinion, we should<br> concentrate on Charly...<br> the preoperative testing,<br> and then you cap it all off...<br> by bringing him out on stage.<br> Why don't you just leave<br> the programming to me?<br> You know, sometimes you give me<br> the feeling you have already...<br> written your acceptance speech<br> for the ceremonies in Stockholm.<br> Bravo!<br> You made us lose a lot of valuable time.<br> Time, as you've often taught me, Professor,<br> is relative...<br> as it creeps on in its petty pace<br> from day to day.<br> - To the last syllable of recorded time.<br> - Edgar Allen Shakespeare.<br> - You both look happy!<br> - I have never felt happier.<br> There were no telephones<br> where you were, Mrs. Kinnian...<br> no post offices until yesterday?<br> I didn't have a dime, I didn't have a stamp,<br> I didn't have the time!<br> She didn't have a dime, time,<br> or the inclination.<br> - Hi, Charly, Mrs. Kinnian!<br> - Bert, how are you? How's Algernon?<br> Last week he said hello to me in Sanskrit.<br> What did you say to him?<br> What do you say to a mouse<br> that says hello in Sanskrit?<br> I said hello!<br> Homecoming! We've still got<br> a little champagne left.<br> Champagne with a plastic top:<br> symbol of our times.<br> Now that you're here,<br> I want to run over tomorrow's program.<br> Very well. What would you like...<br> a treatise on photosynthesis and its effect<br> on fourth-generation computers?<br> By the way, how do your surgical<br> techniques work on retarded computers?<br> And you, Dr. Straus...<br> what would you like for emotional effect?<br> Would you like...<br> an ideational activity or would you like<br> fragmented self-image?<br> I would like a drink.<br> - Fragmented grape.<br> - Thank you.<br> Come on, Professor, cheer up.<br> After tomorrow...<br> you're gonna be on the cover<br> of Time and Newsweek.<br> And you, Dr. Straus, are gonna be<br> in the centerfold of Playboy.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor<br> at this time to present to you...<br> the distinguished Dr. Richard Nemur...<br> and his colleague, Dr. Anna Straus...<br> who are responsible<br> for the Algernon-Gordon effect.<br> You are all acquainted with their<br> eminent qualifications...<br> through their published papers...<br> I told you we're not using<br> the Phase 5 group.<br> I asked Bert to bring them.<br> Some of the behavioral psychologists<br> might care to see them.<br> Is that advisable?<br> I think it is absolutely essential that...<br> Dr. Anna Straus and Dr. Richard Nemur.<br> Learned colleagues...<br> the presentation today will deal first...<br> Give me a cigarette.<br> ...aspects of the Algernon-Gordon effect...<br> which my associate will cover.<br> - Thanks.<br> - I didn't know you smoked.<br> I don't.<br> Listen...<br> - There's absolutely no need to be nervous.<br> - No.<br> There's only a few hundred of the world's<br> most eminent scientists out there.<br> - No reason to be nervous.<br> - Never mind about them.<br> - You are talking directly to me.<br> - Yes.<br> Will you stand where I can see you?<br> Right there.<br> Let me know.<br> ...resulted in a maverick enzyme...<br> of the kind which induces...<br> defective biochemical reaction<br> and causes brain damage.<br> Fortunately, while the destruction<br> to the tissue is irreversible...<br> the protein process is not.<br> Many researchers are able to reverse<br> the process through control of chemicals...<br> which combine with the defective enzymes...<br> and change the molecular shape<br> of the interfering key, as it were.<br> This is also central in our technique.<br> But first we remove<br> the damaged portions of the brain...<br> and permit the implanted tissues...<br> which have been chemically revitalized...<br> to produce brain protein...<br> at an accelerated and supernormal rate.<br> Dr. Straus.<br> And now we would like to show you...<br> a film study of Charly Gordon...<br> when he first came to the clinic.<br> Got my...<br> rabbit's foot.<br> That's very good. Shoes, gloves.<br> Shoes and gloves...<br> - You wear them.<br> - That's right.<br> Morning, afternoon.<br> You don't have to worry<br> about passing or failing. Not these tests.<br> Morning, afternoon...<br> That's a very funny face, Charly.<br> That was Charly Gordon then.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you...<br> to meet Charly Gordon now.<br> Are there any questions?<br> Did you enjoy the film?<br> Mr. Gordon...<br> how do you feel at the present moment<br> about your development?<br> Grateful, sir.<br> - You are happy about it?<br> - Yes.<br> Why?<br> Because it has allowed me to see.<br> To see what?<br> The world.<br> And what do you see in that world?<br> My eyes are new, Doctor.<br> What do they see, Mr. Gordon?<br> Things as they are.<br> And?<br> And what they are becoming.<br> Can you give me an example, Mr. Gordon?<br> No, sir, you give me one.<br> Very well.<br> Modern science.<br> Rampant technology.<br> Conscience by computer.<br> Modern art.<br> Dispassionate draftsmen.<br> - Foreign policy.<br> - Brave new weapons.<br> - Today's youth.<br> - Joyless, guideless.<br> - Today's religion.<br> - Preachment by popularity polls.<br> - Standard of living.<br> - A TV in every room.<br> - Education.<br> - A TV in every room!<br> The world's future, Mr. Gordon.<br> Brave new hates, brave new bombs,<br> brave new wars.<br> - The coming generation.<br> - Test-tube conception, laboratory birth...<br> TV education, brave new dreams,<br> brave new hates, brave new wars...<br> a beautifully purposeless process<br> of society suicide.<br> Any more questions?<br> In the back, any more questions about<br> things as they are...<br> and what they're becoming?<br> No?<br> I have a question.<br> Professor Nemur...<br> Charly Gordon?<br> Come on, Professor, you know.<br> You know, but you haven't told me.<br> Anybody out there answer the question<br> "Charly Gordon?"<br> Anyone in the back answer the question<br> "Charly Gordon?"<br> No.<br> Well, I'm disappointed in you doctors.<br> You're not very smart.<br> You're not even as smart as a mouse.<br> Because he knows.<br> Algernon showed me.<br> The answer to the question...<br> "Charly Gordon?" is:<br> Charly Gordon...<br> is a fellow...<br> who will very shortly be...<br> what he used to be.<br> Professor Nemur...<br> why didn't you tell me...<br> the success of the operation...<br> was only temporary?<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> - Let me buy you a drink.<br> - No.<br> - I wish you would.<br> - Waitress.<br> The entire Phase 5 group...<br> all the same as Algernon.<br> Not one of the mice is capable anymore<br> of solving the simplest problem.<br> Did you find him?<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Why did you have to hide it?<br> But we only discovered an indication<br> of this condition last week, Mrs. Kinnian...<br> and only in a few of the Phase 5 mice.<br> I assumed it was simply erratic behavior,<br> individual behavior.<br> There was no need to alarm Charly!<br> With the convention coming up, why should<br> you both miss your moments of glory?<br> Before we could run further checks,<br> he had no right to make it public.<br> - No right?<br> - Have you any idea what he's done...<br> to our standing in the scientific community?<br> Let us calmly, dispassionately,<br> try to decide what we are going to do...<br> - About this situation.<br> - Which situation?<br> - Your standing or Charly?<br> - They're related, you know.<br> Is that all this means to you?<br> But don't you understand, Mrs. Kinnian?<br> Algernon's regression doesn't prove<br> it will happen to Charly.<br> Charly's a human being,<br> not a laboratory animal.<br> This regressive syndrome may be limited<br> to the mice.<br> I will thank you...<br> Have you been close to something,<br> but not close enough?<br> Is there a second operation you can<br> give him, some corrective surgery?<br> - No.<br> - I see.<br> What do you do here<br> with the specimens that fail?<br> The freezer first, then the incinerator?<br> How can I help?<br> Consider the human brain<br> as an information-processing system...<br> of several parts.<br> The cortical surface consisting of<br> distributed in logic arrays...<br> various multi-directional buses<br> and distributing converters...<br> for converting synaptic memory<br> into DNA storage.<br> One area for investigation<br> is the doctors' hypothesis...<br> that the mind<br> can be permanently improved...<br> through surgery and enzyme enrichment...<br> thereby utilizing unused portions<br> of the brain. Can you program that?<br> It's a little vague, Mr. Gordon.<br> Could you give me more detailed specs?<br> It correlates to what we've already<br> programmed on DNA conversion.<br> I see. Can we use the same system?<br> Right. Just change the variables.<br> Is mental improvement temporary because it<br> lacks appropriate DNA conversion...<br> because of a storage limitation, which tends<br> to overload and disable the repaired area?<br> Any combination of those factors?<br> Run it.<br> Assuming the brain neurons store<br> information on a temporary basis only...<br> let's assume...<br> Thank you, this one's finished.<br> Assuming the brain neurons store<br> information on a temporary basis only...<br> let us assume that this information...<br> is subsequently coded<br> into DNA molecules...<br> permitting storage of far more material<br> than the nerves could hold by themselves.<br> It could be that this transformation<br> takes place during sleep...<br> and is indeed one of the purposes<br> and needs for sleeping...<br> and for dreaming.<br> Simulating brain damage.<br> Comparing homologous lesions<br> in the tissue of animals...<br> and corresponding...<br> It requires no great stretch of imagination<br> to visualize a possible connection...<br> between protein synthesis and...<br> And what?<br> Perhaps the only possible answer...<br> to our question is, whatever we said<br> the mind is, we'll discover it's not.<br> It may be that we've been...<br> trying to capture something<br> which is scientifically...<br> Which by its very nature...<br> is scientifically premature.<br> Charly, go...<br> Go home, Charly.<br> You'll work better in the morning.<br> I'm finished.<br> My work is finished.<br> That's good.<br> Then you can go home...<br> and sleep for at least two days.<br> These tapes will have to be programmed.<br> Could they do it tonight?<br> If you go home and sleep.<br> I'd rather wait.<br> Might take all night.<br> I'll wait.<br> Your evaluations were correct.<br> That's too bad.<br> - It was such a promising theory.<br> - It is.<br> It still is.<br> Thank you.<br> Felt like coffee.<br> Everything's closed.<br> Not at Charly Gordon's.<br> Open 24 hours a day, you know that.<br> - Hungry? Want some eggs?<br> - No, just coffee.<br> I hope it's not too strong.<br> Marry me, Charly.<br> Now.<br> Tonight.<br> I'll get you a spoon.<br> Marry me.<br> All right, don't marry me.<br> Motion carried.<br> But I'm gonna stay. Right here.<br> Whenever you feel like telling me to go,<br> just tell me so. I'll go.<br> Leave.<br> Please leave.<br> All right.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br>
