Before that, Vienna...<br> and before that...<br> -Athens. -Pavia.<br> ANOUK: Pantoufle hated it there.<br> Pantoufle is her kangaroo.<br> But he can't hop.<br> Bad leg. War injury, huh?<br> I'll expect you to keep it in good condition.<br> [Door slams]<br> [Vianne chuckles]<br> [Humming]<br> ANOUK: What a nice town this is.<br> Don't you think so, Mama?<br> It's a lovely town.<br> Mama, Pantoufle wants to know how long we can stay.<br> VIANNE: Oh, tell Pantoufle not to worry.<br> [Whispering]<br> Time for bed. What story tonight?<br> Pantoufle wants to hear about<br> grandmere and grandpere.<br> Not tonight, Anouska.<br> ANOUK: You always say that.<br> Tell about grandmere and grandpere.<br> Not tonight.<br> How about the princess and the pirates?<br> ANOUK: OK.<br> ANOUK: Prepare to fire!<br> All hands on deck!<br> ANOUK: Ready, aim...<br> fire!<br> REYNAUD: Forgive the intrusion.<br> VIANNE: It's a pleasure.<br> ANOUK: Sorry, monsieur.<br> -Pirate attack. -Of course.<br> What is your name?<br> Anouk.

He was not a real one.<br> VIANNE: To what do we owe the honor of your visit?<br> Well, as mayor of Lansquenet...<br> I want to welcome you to the community...<br> and to invite you to worship<br> with us at mass on Sunday.<br> That's very kind of you, but<br> actually we don't attend.<br> VIANNE: We're glad to be so near the church, though.<br> We'll enjoy singing with the bells.<br> The bells are not intended<br> as an entertainment, Madame.<br> They are a solemn call to worship for...<br> VIANNE: Mademoiselle.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> Mademoiselle. I've never been married...<br> but feel free to call me Vianne.<br> I hope you'll stop by when I<br> open for business next week.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, opening a patisserie<br> during the holy Lenten fast.<br> I could imagine better timing.<br> Oh, but it's not going to be a patisserie.<br> Then what do you intend to...<br> It's a surprise.<br> It was sweet of you to drop by.<br> STORYTELLER: The Comte de Reynaud...<br> was a student of history, and<br> therefore a patient man.<br> He trusted the wisdom of generations past.<br> Like his ancestors, he watched<br> over the little village...<br> and led by his own example...<br> hard work, modesty...<br> self-discipline.<br> I have completed the 18th Century.<br> [Sniffling]<br> Madame Clairmont.<br> Your letter to the editor, Monsieur le Comte.<br> This paragraph about family and tradition, it's...<br> it's beautiful.<br> Oh!

Hello!<br> REYNAUD: May I ask...<br> have you been in contact with your mother recently?<br> CAROLINE: Why?<br> She seems to have rented out the patisserie.<br> CAROLINE: Oh.<br> I haven't talked to my mother in quite a while.<br> I'm sorry. I did not mean to pry.<br> Oh, don't be silly.<br> I have no secrets from you.<br> How is the contesse enjoying Venice?<br> The contesse? Oh, she's fine, thank you.<br> Yes, she's enjoying it very much.<br> Venice.<br> [Sighs]<br> WOMAN: I heard she was some kind of radical.<br> I heard she's an atheist.<br> What's that?<br> Don't know.<br> GUILLAUME: Come on, Charly.<br> [Whimpering]<br> Come on.<br> Oh!<br> Uhh!

Do you<br> want to come in and sit down?<br> CAROLINE: Please don't trouble your self. I'm fine.<br> VIANNE: No, it's no trouble. I'm Vianne Rocher.<br> Caroline Clairmont.<br> I'm the daughter of your land lady.<br> This is my son Luc.<br> VIANNE: Hello. And this is my Anouk.<br> Come in, please, where it's warm.<br> Try this.<br> I bet you've never had hot chocolate...<br> made from a 2,000-year-old recipe.<br> Thank you, but no. Luc.<br> CAROLINE: No.<br> WOMAN: What's this?<br> What do you see, Madame, in this?<br> Sorry?<br> VIANNE: What does it look like to you?<br> Just say the first thing that comes into your mind.<br> WOMAN: Um...<br> A woman riding a wild horse?<br> Ha!<br> -Ooh! -Oh, silly answer.<br> Oh, no. There are no silly answers.<br> The pepper triangle, that's for you.<br> A tiny hint of chili pepper...<br> VIANNE: to play against the sweetness.<br> Tangy, adventurous.<br> What do you see?<br> I see teeth.<br> LUC: I see blood...<br> and a skull.<br> Very dark.<br> VIANNE: Bitter chocolate. That's your favorite.<br> CAROLINE: Which will have to wait five weeks more.<br> Lent. Thank you.<br> We must run along. It's been nice to meet you.<br> My pleasure.<br> ANOUK: Pantoufle, come on! Pirate attack!<br> WOMAN: How much are those chili things, please?<br> VIANNE: 4.50 a box.<br> Could you put a ribbon on it?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> WOMAN: Then I can pretend they are from my husband.<br> Of course.<br> [Woman laughing]<br> [Whispering]<br> WOMAN: Josephine Muscat.<br> She waltzes to her own tune.<br> And these are for your husband...<br> unrefined coco nips from Guatemala...<br> to awaken the passions.<br> Ha!<br> You've obviously never met my husband.<br> You've obviously never tried these.<br> [Snoring]<br> [Music plays on radio]<br> Don't be pathetic.<br> [Kids shouting]<br> [Kids shouting and laughing]<br> [Door opens]<br> CAROLINE: Luc.<br> You've got a tiny error in problem six... Oh!<br> Luc! Oh.<br> It's nothing.<br> It already stopped.<br> Mother, the new teacher...<br> wants us to correct our own mistakes.<br> I didn't tell you how to correct the mistake...<br> I just told you that you made one.<br> [Knock on door]<br> [Moaning]<br> [Footsteps]<br> WOMAN: Not hungry, Monsieur le Comte?<br> The Lenten fast, Madame Rivet.<br> Are you not supposed to eat something?<br> It's all right. Leave it.<br> [Whispering]<br> VIANNE: Hello.<br> May I help you?<br> It's expensive. I don't waste money.<br> I have a knack for guessing people's favorites.<br> These are your favorites. Am I right?<br> VIANNE: On the house.<br> I think I'd better... [Mumbling]<br> WOMAN: Well...<br> SECOND WOMAN: This certainly is different.<br> THIRD WOMAN: Yes. Very different.<br> WOMAN: Look at that.<br> [Dog barks]<br> WOMAN: Oh!<br> Oh. I'm so sorry.<br> Bonjour, Monsieur Blerot.<br> Bonjour, Madame Audel.<br> [Dog barking]<br> GUILLAUME: No. Not that way, Charly.<br> Come on.<br> Come in! Please.<br> Come on, boy.<br> I've got something for you.<br> VIANNE: What's your name?<br> GUILLAUME: Charly.

Guillaume Blerot.<br> You're very kind.<br> He has so few pleasures left.<br> Would you care...<br> VIANNE: Would you care to buy...<br> something special for your lady friend?<br> Lady friend?<br> VIANNE: The lovely woman your dog was so fond of.<br> Oh.<br> VIANNE: Her favorite is chocolate seashells.<br> That's my guess.<br> Oh, no.

Yes.<br> Shameless, isn't it?<br> [Clicks off]<br> REYNAUD: The sheer nerve of the woman...<br> opening a chocolaterie just in time for Lent.<br> REYNAUD: The woman is brazen.<br> My heart goes out to that poor...<br> illegitimate child of hers.<br> Mmm.<br> Bonjour.<br> [Singing] You ain't nothin' but a hound dog<br> Cryin' all the time<br> PERE SINGING: You ain't nothin' but a hound dog<br> Cryin' all the time<br> Well, you ain't never caught no rabbit<br> You ain't no friend of mine<br> Ooh, yeah!<br> REYNAUD: A new addition to the liturgy?<br> I have a weakness for American music...<br> Monsieur le Comte.<br> How long have you been with us, Pere Henri?<br> It will be five weeks.<br> Your predecessor, Pere Michel,<br> he was with us for five decades.<br> Yes, well...<br> I only pray I can live up to Pere Michel's example.<br> Yes, that's my prayer also.<br> I looked at your sermon, as you requested.<br> I've made one or two notes.<br> You're very kind.<br> Not at all.<br> Oh, one more thing.<br> If you haven't seen the new chocolaterie...<br> perhaps you might like to take a look.<br> It's important to know one's enemy.<br> Don't you think?<br> VIANNE: Hey, where's my kiss?<br> Aah! Ugh!<br> Watch where you're going!<br> ANOUK: Excuse me!<br> Hello. Morning.<br> What's the decor, Early Mexican Brothel?<br> No!

Something better.<br> Perhaps you should give it to my daughter.<br> ARMANDE: Melt that chilly disposition of hers.<br> You and Caroline have a problem?<br> Do we have a problem?<br> She won't let me see my grandson.<br> I'm cut off from him.<br> VIANNE: Why is that?<br> Armande, why is that?<br> Oh, I'm a bad influence.<br> 'Cause I don't like her treating<br> him like a trained poodle.<br> I swear, that boy doesn't<br> piss without her permission.<br> ARMANDE: Ever since her husband died...<br> she's been so...<br> The way she frets and fusses over that boy.<br> If only she'd let him run, let him breathe...<br> let him live.<br> But she worries that he will overexert himself.<br> Not much danger of that.<br> She won't even let the poor kid ride a bicycle.<br> Do you think he'd like to see you?<br> Do you have more of those bean thingies, please?<br> Oh, sure.<br> VIANNE: How many do you want?<br> How many have you got?<br> Jack of hearts is a better hunter than you, eh?<br> Shoots the trump from right out under your nose.<br> Are you Serge Muscat?<br> The one and only. What's your pleasure?<br> -Is your wife here? -Josephine?<br> Well, it depends what you want with Josephine.<br> Oh, she left this at my shop.<br> Well, let me have it. I'll give it to her.<br> Oh, no. I'll give it to her myself, thanks.<br> MAN: Got to go. I'm late for supper.<br> SECOND MAN: But the game's not over yet.<br> Do you want to play?<br> You know Belote?<br> Of course I do.<br> Sit down.<br> [Footsteps]<br> VIANNE: Josephine.<br> [Clatter]<br> What do you want?<br> You forgot this.<br> What do you want?<br> To be your friend.<br> I don't have friends. Does Serge know you're here?<br> Does it matter?<br> Do me a favor. Try one of these rose creams.<br> Tell me if you think it's a<br> little heavy on the Cointreau.<br> SERGE: Josephine!<br> I'm coming!<br> JOSEPHINE: He talks about you.<br> He says you're indecent.<br> He says you're an influence.<br> You're a bad influence for someone like me...<br> I don't have to listen to a<br> word your husband has to say.<br> JOSEPHINE: No, not Serge.<br> Not him.<br> Reynaud, the mayor.<br> He...he talks about you.<br> Time to go.<br> Look what I won.<br> That's good. Come on.<br> [Man laughs]<br> MAN: Bonsoir.<br> SECOND MAN: You see? I said they'd be here.<br> [Birds chirping]<br> Luc, mind if I take a peek?<br> Oh, um... It's not really...<br> Show me.<br> Oh.<br> Well, I exaggerated the angle of the head.<br> You draw beautifully.<br> What's your going rate?<br> What?<br> To do a portrait.<br> How much would you charge?<br> Oh, I...<br> [Insect buzzing]<br> I couldn't. I'm not really a...<br> Fifty francs? Sound reasonable?<br> It'd be great.<br> [Vianne chuckles]<br> When could you come by my shop?<br> Oh.<br> I'm... I'm really sorry, but...<br> the comte forbids it.<br> He spoke to Mama this morning...<br> and a lot of others.<br> Whatever you say.<br> I wish I could. I really do.<br> Thanks for showing me your drawing.<br> Wait.<br> [Door slams]<br> Am I breaking any laws?<br> Tell me? Am I hurting anyone?<br> You're asking me my opinion?<br> What exactly have you been telling people about me?<br> Only the truth, mademoiselle.<br> Well...<br> if you're expecting me...<br> to just shrivel up and blow away...<br> you're going to be highly disappointed.<br> Let me try and put this into perspective for you.<br> REYNAUD: The first Comte de Reynaud...<br> expelled all the radical<br> Huguenots from this village.<br> You and your truffles present<br> a far lesser challenge.<br> REYNAUD: You'll be out of business by Easter.<br> I promise you that.<br> Aah!<br> Uhh!<br> Aah! Aah!<br> Uhh!<br> [Baby crying]<br> VIANNE: How long have you been standing here?<br> I forgot to pay you for something the other day.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No, it was a gift.<br> No. People talk.<br> No, people would lie about me.<br> I don't steal.<br> Not on purpose. I...<br> VIANNE: Yes, I know.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> Would you like to come in for some chocolate?<br> This is for you.<br> How sweet of you.<br> VIANNE: Thank you.<br> Hmm, it's lovely.<br> I heard you don't go to church.<br> That's right.<br> You won't last long here.<br> JOSEPHINE: People talk.<br> Oh, sorry.<br> I'm behaving badly, aren't I?<br> VIANNE: No, it's OK.<br> JOSEPHINE: You don't misbehave here.<br> It's just not done, did you know that?<br> If you don't go to Confession...<br> or if you don't dig your flower beds...<br> or if you don't pretend...<br> that you want nothing more in your life...<br> than to serve your husband three meals a day...<br> and give him children and vacuum under his ass...<br> then... then you're crazy.<br> You must think I'm stupid to stay with him.<br> No, I don't think you're stupid.<br> Well, I am. I'm weak.<br> I don't love my husband, and I lie.<br> Things could be different for you, Josephine.<br> Serge doesn't run the world.<br> He might as well.<br> VIANNE: Is that what you believe?<br> I know it.<br> Oh.<br> Then it must be true.<br> My mistake.<br> You make the most wonderful chocolate.<br> [Sips]<br> Pantoufle wants to hear the story...<br> of grandmere and grandpere.<br> Ohh!<br> Don't say, "Not tonight.<br> " You always say, "Not tonight."<br> All right, all right.<br> Oh.<br> Your grandfather...<br> George Rocher...<br> was the young apothecary of<br> the town of Aulus-les-Bains.<br> STORYTELLER: It was Anouk's favorite story.<br> STORYTELLER: It was Anouk's favorite story.<br> Always told in the same words.<br> George was honest, prosperous...<br> and trusted by his customers.<br> But George was not content.<br> He felt there should be more to life...<br> than dispensing liver oil.<br> In the spring of 1927...<br> the Societe Pharmeceutique...<br> formed an expedition to Central America...<br> to study the medicinal properties...<br> of certain natural compounds.<br> George was the expedition's most eager volunteer.<br> But his adventure took a turn he did not expect.<br> One night, he was invited<br> to drink unrefined cacao...<br> with a pinch of chili.<br> The very same drink the ancient Maya...<br> used in their sacred ceremonies.<br> The Maya believed cacao held the power...<br> to unlock hidden yearnings...<br> and reveal destinies.<br> And so it was that George first saw Chitza.<br> Now, George had been raised a good Catholic...<br> but in his romance with Chitza...<br> he was willing to slightly bend the rules...<br> of Christian courtship.<br> The tribal elders tried to warn George about her.<br> She was one of the wanderers.<br> Her people moved with the North Wind...<br> from village to village...<br> dispensing ancient remedies...<br> never settling down.<br> Not a good choice for a bride.<br> George did not heed their warning...<br> and for a while, it seemed that he and Chitza...<br> might lead a happy life together in France.<br> [Wind blowing]<br> Alas, the clever North Wind had other plans.<br> [Banging]<br> One morning, George awoke to discover...<br> that Chitza and the little girl Vianne...<br> had gone away.<br> Mother and daughter...<br> were fated to wander from village to village...<br> dispensing ancient cacao remedies...<br> traveling with the wind.<br> Just as Chitza's people had done...<br> for generations.<br> VIANNE: Just as Chitza's people...<br> had done for generations.<br> Will it just go on forever?<br> Night, Mama.<br> I appreciate your coming in, Armande.<br> What's so important that I had to postpone my nap?<br> I've got some chocolate cake.<br> Grandmother.<br> Grandmother...bonjour.<br> May I...<br> Would you like a cup of...?<br> No, thank you.<br> I'm just here to do a portrait.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Whose?<br> Yours, actually.<br> VIANNE: Is the light OK where she's sitting?<br> I have something for you, boy.<br> I've been carrying it around<br> since your last birthday.<br> It's a book of poetry.<br> Oh.<br> Thank you.<br> You don't like poetry?<br> Oh, no. Of course I do.<br> Yes.<br> Neither do I.<br> It's not that kind of poetry.<br> And in a moment of weakness...<br> I prayed to the Virgin Mother...<br> to soothe Charly's soul in his hour of suffering.<br> You understand an animal has no immortal soul.<br> I understand, mon pere.<br> Yet you flout God's law.<br> GUILLAUME: I'm weak and a sinner.<br> PERE: What else?<br> Impure thoughts.<br> GUILLAUME: The woman who runs the chocolaterie.<br> Vianne Rocher?<br> She suggested I buy chocolate seashells...<br> for the widow Audel.<br> And, well...<br> I guess that got me to thinking<br> about the widow Audel.<br> At her age? At your age?<br> Yes. And yes.<br> And just what were you doing<br> in a chocolaterie during Lent?<br> It was for Charly.<br> Again you flout God's law.<br> Well, but if Charly has no soul...<br> then there's no harm in him breaking Lent.<br> GUILLAUME: Isn't that so, mon pere?<br> Ten Hail Marys, twenty Our Fathers.<br> "Will she never have done, then...<br> "that ghoul queen of a million dead bodies?<br> "I see myself again...<br> "skin rotten with mud and pest...<br> "worms in my armpits and in my hair."<br> It's perfectly wretched, isn't it?<br> Perfectly.<br> VIANNE: Would you like some cake?<br> Ahem. I'm not supposed to.<br> Don't worry so much about not supposed to.<br> ARMANDE: Hmm?<br> Live a little.<br> Oh, her hair appointment's almost done.<br> I have to go.<br> -What about my picture? -Next time.<br> LUC: Thank you for the cake.<br> Don't look so damn pleased with yourself.<br> [Knock on door]<br> Stay here.<br> [Pounding on door]<br> [Pounding louder]<br> JOSEPHINE: I did it. [Laughs]<br> I did it. He...<br> He was so drunk.<br> [Giggles] He woke up.<br> He woke up. He saw me packing, but...<br> So he tried to come after me...<br> but I had already tied his<br> feet with his belt, and...<br> Ha ha ha ha ha.<br> Boom! Right on his face.<br> [Laughing]<br> Right there on his big, red face.<br> VIANNE: Mmm.<br> VIANNE: Oh.<br> Tsk. Ohh.<br> It is so stupid, isn't it?<br> I never blame him.<br> Sometimes I even forget what really happened.<br> VIANNE: Now, now, now.<br> [Crying]<br> VIANNE: Shh.<br> I saved her!<br> You remember her father<br> collaborated with the Germans?<br> Nobody wanted to touch her. Except for me.<br> And this is the way she repays me?!<br> Your anger is understandable.<br> Anger? Everybody's laughing at me!<br> REYNAUD: That is not your concern.<br> Your concern is the sacrament of marriage.<br> SERGE: Yeah, of course. The sacrament.<br> VIANNE: Dip the ganshbe into the white chocolate.<br> Like this?<br> Good. Yes, shake it, a little.<br> Good.<br> Put it on the parchment sheet.<br> You're doing great.<br> [Door opens]<br> Oh. I'll be right back.<br> Oh. Good morning.<br> Can I interest you in some Nipples of Venus?<br> Rumor has it that you are harboring Madame Muscat.<br> REYNAUD: Is that true?<br> You make her sound like a fugitive.<br> She is a fugitive, from her marriage vows...<br> which have been sanctified by God.<br> Josephine?<br> VIANNE: Come out here a minute.<br> Let His Radiance have a look at you, hmm?<br> VIANNE: Is that sanctified enough for you?<br> It's not the first time.<br> I'm truly sorry.<br> REYNAUD: You should have come to me.<br> Your husband will be made to repent for this.<br> Tell him to repent on someone else's head.<br> REYNAUD: Come on. In!<br> SERGE: Monsieur le Comte!<br> I'm going to make an example of you.<br> In there. He's ready.<br> Well, but confession must be made...<br> in the spirit of contrition.<br> Have you come in the spirit of contrition?<br> Contrition, yes.<br> He's ready.<br> [Sighs]<br> BAPTISTE: Licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery...<br> gluttony, and drunkenness.<br> Correct.<br> And what are the three conditions for mortal sin?<br> Serge?<br> Mortal sin...<br> is sin whose object is...<br> committed by...<br> deliberate...consequence.<br> Incorrect. Didi?<br> Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter...<br> which is committed with full knowledge...<br> and deliberate consent.<br> PERE: Correct.<br> Gah!<br> VIANNE: So, how do you know...<br> if the coverture is properly tempered?<br> JOSEPHINE: You check to see<br> if it's at body temperature.<br> Then you dip the palette knife...<br> to see that the coverture hardens on it evenly.<br> Correct.<br> Closer.<br> Aah.<br> STORYTELLER: In the village, time passed.<br> And the chocolaterie did not go out of business.<br> [Drops package]<br> [Charly yelps]<br> STORYTELLER: The Comte de Reynaud...<br> felt himself being drawn into a strange crusade.<br> His struggle to transform Serge into a gentleman...<br> became more than an act of good will.<br> It became a test...<br> a holy war between chateau...<br> and chocolaterie.<br> [Charly howls]<br> LUC: Each time, I...<br> I tell myself it's the last time.<br> But then I...<br> I get a whiff of a hot chocolate.<br> Or those moon things.<br> AUDEL: Chocolate seashells.<br> So small, so plain, so innocent.<br> I thought, just one little taste...<br> it can't do any harm.<br> But it turned out that they were filled...<br> with rich, sinful...<br> YVETTE: Buttery filling...<br> and it melts, God forgive me...<br> it melts ever-so-slowly on your tongue...<br> and tortures you with pleasure.<br> PERE: Against You alone, have I sinned...<br> and done what is evil in Your sight.<br> [Plastic crinkling]<br> [Crinkling stops]<br> Indeed I was born guilty...<br> a sinner when my mother conceived me.<br> You desire truth in the inward being...<br> therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.<br> [Swallows]<br> STORYTELLER: Now, the comte was no fool.<br> Though he hoped to redeem Serge...<br> he knew that this redemption alone...<br> would not be enough...<br> to regain control over the village.<br> He understood that some larger lesson...<br> needed to be taught.<br> Some greater problem...<br> needed to be identified and solved.<br> Little did the comte suspect<br> that his greater problem...<br> would arrive one quiet afternoon...<br> in the dull green waters of the river Tannes.<br> [Children playing]<br> You're it!<br> You're it!<br> Hey, look!<br> BOY: I'm over here!<br> VIANNE: You've never really<br> told me what the problem is...<br> between you and Caroline.<br> 'Cause it's none of your damn business.<br> [Armande sighs]<br> ARMANDE: I'm an embarrassment to her.<br> I swear, I read dirty books.<br> I eat and drink what I like.<br> And sin of sins...<br> I refuse to go to Les Mimosas.<br> JOSEPHINE: When I was a kid,<br> we called it Le Mortoir.<br> It's a nursing home for old...<br> It's in Toulouse.<br> Mmm.<br> ARMANDE: Caroline loves the thought of a nurse...<br> with a clipboard recording my bowel movements.<br> ANOUK: Mama, Mama, come quick!<br> They're here! They've come to Lansquenet!<br> -Slow down, Anouk. Who's here? -Pirates!<br> Come on!<br> -Why can't we stay? -Come on!<br> BOY: But why can't we stay?<br> OK, enough.<br> BOY: But, Mama, just a little bit.<br> MAMA: Come on.<br> VIANNE: Hello. How are you?<br> ANOUK: Anybody got a sweet tooth?<br> [Guitar playing]<br> [Guitar continues playing]<br> I bet he's the captain.<br> VIANNE: Anouk, don't do that.<br> Anouk, don't do that, please.<br> -How do you do? -Sorry.<br> ROUX: I'd like to apologize.<br> For all of us. Sincerely.<br> What for?<br> ROUX: For whatever it is<br> you're here to accuse us of.<br> Why would I do that?<br> Well, because we river rats<br> are the dregs of society.<br> With horrible diseases and criminal impulses.<br> [Chuckles] Sounds terrifying.<br> Is it true?<br> It's what you townspeople<br> always seem to think, isn't it?<br> This is not my town. Sorry.<br> ROUX: Well, then, what do you want?<br> ROUX: Well, then, what do you want?<br> Are you here to save us?<br> Are you the Catholic Aid Society?<br> French Family League? Communist Workers?<br> Which idea are you selling?<br> Chocolate.<br> I'm sorry, chocolate?<br> ANOUK: What's a river rat?<br> Is it like a pirate?<br> [Vianne chuckles]<br> Yeah, you could say that.<br> You could.<br> Have a look at my treasure chest.<br> VIANNE: Oh.<br> Let me guess, they're for sale.<br> ROUX: As a matter of fact, they are.<br> For a mere thirty francs apiece.<br> You laugh? I can get fifty for them in Paris.<br> Then go to Paris.<br> We'll take two, please.<br> You'll take two?<br> Yes, please, absolutely.<br> ROUX: OK.<br> VIANNE: I don't know if I have the right change.<br> Just a minute.<br> They're beautiful.<br> ROUX: Ireland's finest.<br> Thanks.<br> Thank you. Listen...<br> I should probably warn you.<br> You make friends with us,<br> you'll make enemies of others.<br> That a promise?<br> It's a guarantee.<br> [Laughing]<br> ALPHONSE: What's he up to?<br> JEAN-MARC: Maybe he's joining the circus.<br> [Door rattles]<br> Sorry, we're closed!<br> Josephine, you look different.<br> So do you.<br> I just want to tell you that I am so sorry.<br> SERGE: For everything.<br> But I've changed.<br> You see, God has made me a new man.<br> I ask you, I beg you...<br> please accept my apology.<br> I accept.<br> I promise, from now on,<br> everything will be different.<br> Everything already is different, Serge.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Well, I mean, when you come home.<br> Home?<br> Thanks for the apology. The flowers are lovely.<br> No, please don't, Josephine.<br> We are still married in the eyes of God.<br> Then he must be blind.<br> [Locks door]<br> JEAN-MARC: The council has no legal authority...<br> to force them to move.<br> The riverbank is public land.<br> [Grumbling]<br> The mayor wishes to say a few words.<br> REYNAUD: If I may...<br> ladies and gentlemen of the council.<br> These people are rootless, godless drifters.<br> MAN: That's right!<br> REYNAUD: Theirs is the way of slovenly pleasure.<br> MAN: Yes.<br> They would contaminate the spirit of our quiet town.<br> REYNAUD: The innocence of our children.<br> Now, the chairman of the council is quite right.<br> We cannot force them to leave.<br> MAN: Why not?<br> But we can help them to understand...<br> that they are not welcome.<br> [Muttering]<br> [Glass shatters]<br> Josephine?<br> Josephine, you think you can just walk out on me?<br> SERGE: You stupid woman!<br> Worthless cow!

Why don't you show?<br> CAROLINE: Insulin shots.<br> She has diabetes... very advanced.<br> CAROLINE: She could be blind within a year.<br> Yeah. Couldn't you call me a drug addict?<br> It sounds a lot more glamorous.<br> And you... you sit here feeding her sweets.<br> ARMANDE: There are worse ways to die.<br> CAROLINE: Why don't you just give her rat poison?<br> It would be faster.<br> ARMANDE: Carol has a flair for drama.<br> She needs to be in a place where<br> she can be taken care of.<br> Le Mortoir?<br> I'd rather be in Hell.<br> Ah.<br> You may get there, Mother.<br> Luc, come with me.<br> I don't want to.<br> He's happy here.

Did you know that?<br> Armande...<br> the whole town's against me.<br> [Sighs] What can I do?<br> Throw me a party.<br> VIANNE: Ha ha ha! What?<br> ARMANDE: Wednesday's my 70th.<br> Let's show the bastards we're<br> ready to go down dancing.<br> [Both laugh]<br> But a party?<br> You're not well. You have to face it.<br> OK, OK, OK...<br> But you do this for me, and I promise...<br> I'll check into Le Mortoir the very next morning...<br> without a care in the world.<br> [Sighs]<br> If I threw a party in this town, no one would come.<br> They don't need to know who's throwing it.<br> Armande, listen, I...<br> No, no, no. You listen.<br> I need this.<br> ARMANDE: Huh?<br> When I need help, I ask for it.<br> [Guitar music playing]<br> WOMAN: Boys, bring me some more wood.<br> VIANNE: My mother used to sing that song...<br> when I couldn't sleep.<br> And did it help?<br> [Playing guitar]<br> I still didn't sleep, but, yes, it helped.<br> How's the door?<br> It squeaks.<br> -Does it? -Ha ha!<br> How's Anouk? Is she well?<br> Oh, she's better. She's fine.<br> ROUX: Good. How are you?<br> I'm throwing a party...<br> If anyone shows up.<br> Thanks.<br> Who's invited?<br> A bunch of townspeople.<br> Tell me something. Why do you give a damn about...<br> what these narrow-minded villagers think?<br> You're not scared of them, are you?<br> Coming to the party or not?<br> I can't.<br> ROUX: There's a boycott against immorality...<br> and I must respect that.<br> That is a problem.<br> Then, I'll leave you with this<br> test of your convictions.<br> What is that?<br> Your favorite.<br> My favorite?

OK, good, good. T-try again.<br> I think we've gone over this enough.<br> Let's call it a day.<br> What?<br> I'm very tired.<br> Fine, fine. Well, leave it with me.<br> I may have one or two suggestions.<br> Thank you, Monsieur le Comte...<br> Just a couple of suggestions.<br> A revision here and there.<br> We want it to be perfect tomorrow, don't we?<br> -Yes. -Yes.<br> We must resist the shallow, worldly temptations...<br> of our mortal... No, no.<br> We must renounce shallow, worldly temptations...<br> of our mortal flesh.<br> [Women talking]<br> [Reynaud gasps]<br> Caroline.<br> All my efforts have been for nothing.<br> I've suffered willingly.<br> I've fasted.<br> I've hardly eaten for weeks now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, my suffering is nothing.<br> It's just that I... I feel so lost.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Tell me what to do.<br> [Grunts]<br> Aaah!<br> [Grunting]<br> [Gasps]<br> Huh.<br> [Panting]<br> [Grunting]<br> Ha ha ha ha ha ha!<br> [Laughing]<br> [Laughing]<br> Ohh!<br> Unhh!<br> [Laughing]<br> [Sobbing]<br> [Pere whistling]<br> [Fizzing]<br> VIANNE: Drink this.<br> Drink this.<br> It'll refresh you.<br> I promise.<br> Go ahead, drink.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I won't tell a soul.<br> VIANNE: Hmm. Better get cleaned up.<br> Easter Sunday.<br> The sermon.<br> I didn't finish it.<br> I'll think of something.<br> I'm not sure what the theme of<br> my homily today ought to be.<br> PERE: Do I want to speak of the miracle...<br> of our Lord's divine transformation?<br> Not really, no.<br> PERE: I don't want to talk about His divinity.<br> I'd rather talk about His humanity.<br> I mean, you know, how he lived<br> his life here on Earth.<br> His kindness.<br> His tolerance.<br> Listen, here's what I think.<br> I think we can't go around...<br> measuring our goodness by what we don't do.<br> PERE: By what we deny ourselves...<br> what we resist...<br> and who we exclude.<br> I think we've got to measure goodness...<br> by what we embrace...<br> what we create...<br> and who we include.<br> [Pipe organ playing]<br> STORYTELLER: It was certainly not...<br> the most fiery sermon Pere<br> Henri would ever preach...<br> nor the most eloquent.<br> But the parishioners felt a new sensation that day.<br> A lightening of the spirit.<br> [Accordion music playing]<br> STORYTELLER: A freedom from the old "tranquilit?<br> Whoa! Fantastic!<br> Monsieur le Comte, try one of these.<br> Thank you.<br> STORYTELLER: Even the Comte de Reynaud...<br> felt strangely...<br> released.<br> Although, it would take another six months...<br> before he'd work up the nerve<br> to ask Caroline out to dinner.<br> As for Josephine...<br> she took over the lease at the old cafe...<br> and gave it a new name.<br> [Wind howling]<br> [Door banging]<br> STORYTELLER: But still the clever North Wind...<br> was not satisfied.<br> [Inhales]<br> STORYTELLER: The Wind spoke to Vianne...<br> of towns yet to be visited.<br> Friends in need, yet to be discovered.<br> Battles yet to be fought.<br> By someone else... next time.<br> And so it was, the North Wind grew weary...<br> and went on its way.<br> When summer came to the little village...<br> a new breeze from the south blew soft and warm.<br> Just needed an adjustment.<br> Hope it'll be better now.<br> ANOUK: Roux!<br> STORYTELLER: My mother knew Roux's return...<br> had nothing to do with a silly old door.<br> So did I.<br> I thought you'd never guess.<br> My favorite, hot chocolate.<br> I knew that.<br> STORYTELLER: As for Pantoufle?<br> Well, his bad leg miraculously healed...<br> and he hopped off in search of new adventures.<br> I didn't miss him.<br>
