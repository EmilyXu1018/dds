Old Buck.<br> Well, hate to be making it into a firefight.<br> If it ain't the old honker, himself.<br> Got yourself hitched?<br> Yeah, I've got a wife and son,<br> four years old now.<br> Aye, this is like a Fourth of July<br> celebration on Judgment Day.<br> - Beats all Creation.<br> - Say, where are you heading for, Yancey?<br> - I'm cutting dirt for the Little Bear Creek.<br> - That's the spot, believe me.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> You're Yancey Cravat, aren't you?<br> - And you?<br> - Lee, Dixie Lee.<br> - Indeed.<br> - Going for a town site?<br> No, I'm going for a quarter-section ranch<br> out at the Little Bear Creek.<br> That's funny,<br> I'm heading for Little Bear, too.<br> Well, I know just the piece of land I want.<br> It's deep in the gully<br> and a lot of scrub over.<br> Ready, aim...<br> - You near flummoxed.

I do like it here.<br> I'm so glad we came away from Wichita.<br> And you should've seen them<br> open their eyes at this.<br> - What do you think of it?<br> - Cruelty to animals.<br> Yancey. It's the very latest thing<br> from Chicago.<br> Some old squaw sees some of that,<br> and she'll want to buy a pair...<br> and put a papoose in each sleeve.<br> Cousin Della writes<br> they'll be even fuller by autumn.<br> By autumn?<br> - What's in the telegram?<br> - News, sugar.<br> President Cleveland has set a date<br> for the opening of the Cherokee strip.<br> The Cherokee land?<br> The government's bought it<br> from the Indians for the huge sum...<br> of $1.40 an acre.<br> - Pushing them further back.<br> - Well, it's a good thing.<br> They made no use of it, anyhow.<br> Dirty, filthy, good for nothing, low...<br> Honey.<br> Honey, come here.<br> Let's go, Sabra. Let's go for an allotment<br> of that Cherokee land.<br> This is the biggest thing<br> in the history of Oklahoma.<br> - Leave here?<br> - Sell out the paper, at a profit...<br> - and go for a town site this time.<br> - Give up all we've worked and slaved for?<br> We gave up Wichita,<br> and advice, and Southern fried chicken.<br> Let's get out of all this.<br> Was Mother right when she said<br> you'd go for the adventure of it.<br> Five years.<br> The longest time you've ever stayed<br> in one place.<br> You've been here only four.<br> Well, don't you realize, sugar?<br> This is a new empire.<br> Why, we'll see it grow<br> before our very eyes into a new state.<br> We can't tear up our lives and start over<br> again. You've done your share.<br> - I know...<br> - Let the others go.<br> Honey, this is a chance of a lifetime.<br> No.<br> Let's not talk any more about it.<br> Yancey, you don't mean... Oh, darling.<br> Sugar, if we all took root and squatted,<br> there'd never be any new country.<br> We got a horse for you, Yancey.<br> You're not going now, today?<br> - I've got to.<br> - You can't go like this.<br> Sugar, come on and go with me.<br> - But Cim, Donna...<br> - The children, too.

You're always hearing something<br> about him being somewhere.<br> Now, I heard that...<br> Fella told me he was over at<br> Cherokee strip living with a squaw.<br> Someone said he's over at the Kickapoo<br> land opening, sold out for big money.<br> I heard he was in Amarillo. Drunk a<br> quart of whiskey in a day and died.<br> Suppose it's true<br> about Yancey and Dixie Lee...<br> that he sent her the money<br> to build that brick house?<br> Folks that use up air for that kind of talk<br> have one-chambered minds...<br> and mighty small caliber.<br> - Old boy's kind of touchy today.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, that Dixie Lee case<br> comes up this afternoon, don't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Old Charlie Flash is on the jury.<br> Sure hope he's sober.<br> These are all right and corrected, Rickey.<br> - But I want a reprint on this one.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - But how about the boilerplates?<br> - No, we won't have room.<br> The Dixie Lee story<br> will carry over to the second page.<br> - So, they let her out on bail yesterday?<br> - Well, they wouldn't if I had my way.<br> Don't you think that you're being<br> a little too severe on Dixie Lee...<br> - putting her in jail?<br> - No...<br> and I'll show her something<br> before I'm through.<br> - Well, that's for you.<br> - Now, I don't mean to be abrupt.<br> That's all right.<br> My ad looks good,<br> even if I did write it myself.<br> I brought the check.<br> Now, you're paying this today<br> just to help me.<br> No. See, I get my money's worth.<br> Everybody reads the paper<br> since you made it a daily.<br> - It's doing fine, huh?<br> - Yes.<br> If people would only pay the bills in cash,<br> instead of in trade.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Look what I get in trade at the store.<br> A man comes in, buys a pair of pants,<br> some stockings...<br> a piece of calico and gives me a bear cub.<br> What should I do with a bear cub?

It's Ruby.<br> Well...<br> Why, I should think you'd be ashamed<br> of yourself...<br> mooning around with an Indian hired girl.<br> Ruby isn't an Indian hired girl.<br> She's the daughter of an Osage chief.<br> Osage, fiddlesticks.<br> She's just as important<br> in the Osage nation as...<br> well, as Alice Roosevelt is in Washington.<br> I've heard just about enough from you,<br> Cimarron Cravat.<br> And you might just as well know it,<br> that as soon as I'm on my own...<br> I'm gonna marry Ruby.<br> - Your father will put a stop to this.<br> - Dad knows.<br> It's all right with him.<br> Ruby's waiting, Mother.<br> Goodbye.<br> Well, that's a nice social problem,<br> an Indian in the family.<br> Well, I'm going to pick out the richest<br> white man in town and marry him.<br> Sure struck it rich, Louis.<br> Yes, boys.

one that'll do just...<br> - Now, let me understand.<br> We'll have an agent appointed...<br> who will steal the money<br> from the Indians?<br> Well, just a matter of bookkeeping,<br> you know.<br> Mr. Leary, I've known<br> all about your scheme for weeks...<br> and I think it's the dirtiest,<br> filthiest piece of politics...<br> that ever came into<br> the State of Oklahoma...<br> and I'll smash you<br> and everybody connected with it...<br> - before I'm through with you.<br> - You ain't coming in, then?<br> Then I'll smash your chances<br> for governor...<br> and I can do it, too.<br> Yancey, you know about Cim and Ruby.<br> We can't live our children's lives<br> for them, honey.<br> Listen to this, the lead for tomorrow.<br> "The demagogues plan to rob them again.<br> "Stealing the vast ocean of oil gushing up<br> through the miserable, barren land...<br> "known as the Osage Indian reservation...<br> "again victimizing those duped and<br> wretched Americans, the Osage Indians.<br> "Their treaties broken, their land stolen...<br> "and now there's about to burst forth<br> the gaudiest...<br> "star-spangled piece of crookedness...<br> "ever played under the wing<br> of a double-dealing government."<br> - We can't print that.<br> - And why not?<br> This isn't the Cimarron country.<br> It's the State of Oklahoma.<br> You can't slur the government.<br> It's treason.<br> It's history.<br> I don't blame the government<br> for crooked politicians' tricks.<br> I'll show them.<br> I'll stop them if it's the last thing I ever do.<br> -

Yes, I'll be right with you.<br> We leave for Bowlegs<br> immediately, gentlemen.<br> It's a new empire.<br> Quite a pretty place isn't it, Mrs. Cravat?<br> All this up from raw prairie. Overnight.<br> Hello? Field office?<br> Send an ambulance. Quick! Osage, three.<br> Yeah, yeah, that's right.<br> What happened?<br> We've never had a closer call.<br> Gusher came in ahead of time.<br> They were lowering a torpedo<br> of nitroglycerin.<br> Before they could explode it, up came the<br> mud and oil, and the torpedo with it.<br> Narrow escape?<br> We'd all have been blown to bits,<br> everyone around here, too...<br> if it hadn't been for a man<br> who grabbed the torpedo...<br> cushioned it against his body<br> and prevented the explosion.<br> What nerve!<br> - He saved our lives. That's all.<br> - Was he badly hurt?<br> Jammed against a rake.<br> Chest crushed, pretty bad.<br> - Who was he?<br> - I don't know.<br> Just an old drifter who'd been hanging<br> around here since the new field opened.<br> Some of the fellas call him old Yance.<br> Yance.<br> Get back. Give him some room.<br> Get back. Come on.<br> Let me through! Let me through!<br> Sabra. Sabra.<br> Are you all right?<br> Wife and mother. Stainless woman.<br> Hide me. Hide me in your love.<br> Sleep, my boy.<br>
