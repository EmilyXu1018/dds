You got me?<br> Are you giving me your word?<br> Yes.<br> Go on.<br> I promise.<br> And I promise you...<br> we will never send you away.<br> It's okay, kid.<br> You got a little scared.<br> I understand.<br> It's okay.<br> Jim, he's a very slow guy.<br> Just plants himself there.<br> So you just keep him steady.<br> Keep him trapped in the middle.<br> Keep dancing around him, okay?<br> You know what to do.<br> You know this type.<br> That guy's a bum.<br> Two bits will<br> get a guy a seat.<br> And that guy gets to watch<br> you bleed and call you a bum.<br> And I know I gotta take it from<br> him, 'cause he's a paying customer.<br> I see.<br> Well, well, well.<br> Pardon me, miss. Allow<br> me to restate my position.<br> Mr. Abraham Feldman<br> is a novice fighter...<br> whose ass you should<br> gently kick...<br> until it is humped up<br> between his shoulder blades.<br> That is, if it doesn't offend<br> your overly sensitive nature.<br> God knows.<br> Now, you see, that break's<br> still a few weeks away.<br> I know.<br> Yeah.<br> And you were gonna tell me<br> about this when?<br> It's gonna be fine. It's<br> not fine. No, it's not.<br> What the hell?<br> You don't tell me?<br> What the hell kinda crap is<br> that? I owe everybody money, Joe.<br> I can't get any shifts.<br> We ain't got any cash.<br> I got it.<br> Screw them.<br> I'll tape it double.<br> Thanks.<br> Keep up. Stay up.<br> Keep moving.<br> Keep your legs moving.<br> And here comes Braddock<br> with his long-time manager,<br> Joe Gould.<br> You're washed up, Braddock.<br> And now for our main event.<br> Hey, which one's us, pal?<br> Jersey veteran<br> James J. Braddock...<br> is up against Hymie Caplin's<br> latest charge...<br> young Abe Feldman<br> from Schenectady, New York.<br> Six rounder.<br> Some might recall<br> that Braddock was once...<br> a light heavyweight<br> title challenger.<br> His golden-boy peak ended<br> when Tommy Loughran...<br> handled Jim over 15 rounds<br> back in '29.<br> Since then,<br> the oft-injured Braddock...<br> has shown only a glimmer<br> of his early promise.<br> And the losses have started<br> to pile up.<br> But Braddock continues<br> to battle.<br> And here comes<br> the popular Abe Feldman.<br> Feldman looks to be<br> the real thing...<br> and showed some real moxie in<br> his recent win over Hans Birkie.<br> Hey, who whipped Latzo?<br> I did.<br> Goddamn right.<br> Who KO'ed Slattery<br> in the ninth...<br> when everybody said he didn't<br> have a rainmaker's chance in hell?<br> That'd have to be me, too.<br> Right.<br> And we're supposed to pucker our<br> assholes over this Abe Feldman?<br> The guy couldn't break wind.<br> No.<br> Hey, Jimmy.<br> Anyplace else you'd rather be?<br> No.<br> Good.<br> Now, what are you<br> gonna do about it?<br> Here we are halfway<br> through the fifth<br> And it's more of the same.<br> The boys clinch again.<br> Break it up.<br> He's crushing my guy.<br> Get him off!<br> Break!<br> The boo-birds<br> have started flying here.<br> They want action<br> from these fighters.<br> Feldman sticks a left<br> in Braddock's face.<br> Braddock's right hand<br> is his best and only weapon.<br> He'll show the left, but it<br> lacks snap and Feldman knows it.<br> Come on, give these yokels<br> a shot in the ass!<br> Feldman ducks a haymaker<br> but fails to follow up.<br> And another big right<br> by Braddock.<br> Now, there's the Braddock<br> we all recall.<br> But it's one at a time.<br> It may not be enough.<br> Come on!<br> The referee pulls<br> the boys apart.<br> And there's the bell<br> to end the fifth.<br> Easy now. Easy.<br> I saw that.<br> You bust it again?<br> I'm calling it, Jim.<br> You gonna use the left?<br> Okay, good.<br> You get in there but you<br> don't let him crowd you.<br> You work his belly, you<br> hammer his belly with the left.<br> Last round. Come on,<br> you got to show me something.<br> Give me a good one. You're<br> giving me an ulcer, Harry!<br> Shut up.<br> Work his belly with the left.<br> You got it?<br> Give him the flapdoodle with<br> the right because he don't know.<br> Right?<br> 'Cause he's kind of stupid.<br> Okay? Last round.<br> Last round! Go get him!<br> The left!<br> Damn it, I wish he could find<br> his goddamn left.<br> That's it! Change it up!<br> Southpaw, that's it!<br> Feldman prancing around,<br> looking for an opening...<br> but still few clean punches<br> by the fighters.<br> Braddock still pawing away<br> with the left.<br> Another ineffectual left<br> from Feldman.<br> Braddock can hardly lift his<br> arms. He's slow on his feet.<br> At least Gould in his corner<br> is still throwing punches...<br> trying to urge his man on.<br> Go home!<br> Go home, Braddock!<br> No holding, Braddock!<br> Cavanaugh's working harder<br> than the fighters.<br> Dry up!<br> Another clinch.<br> It's as if 80 tough fights have<br> finally jumped on Braddock's back.<br> You're a bum!<br> That's it!<br> Cavanaugh pulls them apart,<br> and he's called the fight.<br> He's called the fight.<br> It's a "no contest. "<br> And the popcorn and the<br> peanuts are raining down.<br> And I'm afraid to say that's<br> all these fighters deserve...<br> for the show<br> they put on tonight.<br> I'm telling you, it's sad to<br> see a fighter that was once...<br> the caliber of James Braddock<br> reduced to this.<br> It's all right, Jimmy.<br> An embarrassment,<br> that's what it was.<br> An embarrassment!<br> Where the hell's the purse?<br> You wouldn't have<br> to be asking that...<br> if you gave a shit<br> about your fighter.<br> Okay. He's fighting hurt.<br> Maybe you got a bunch of fat<br> and happy fighters at home...<br> can afford to rest a month between<br> bouts. I don't know. Lucky you!<br> Christ, he hardly gets<br> a punch in anymore!<br> Fights being stopped by<br> referees? He's pathetic!<br> Fights like that<br> keep people away.<br> We're revoking his license,<br> Joe.<br> Whatever Braddock was gonna do<br> in boxing, I guess he's done it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> That's all.<br> Oh, boy.<br> Mr. Johnston!<br> Jim.<br> What's going on?<br> You didn't tell him?<br> Yeah, of course I told him.<br> He wanted to<br> hear it from you.<br> Come on, Mr. Johnston,<br> no contest?<br> I broke my hand.<br> Okay? It's legit.<br> You don't see me<br> crying about it.<br> I don't see what you got<br> to complain about.<br> I still went out there, I still put<br> on a show. I did what I could do.<br> You know, we did that<br> boondock circuit for you...<br> me and Joe. Remember?<br> I didn't quit on you.<br> And I didn't quit tonight.<br> I didn't always lose.<br> I won't always lose again.<br> I can still fight.<br> Go home.<br> I can still fight. Go home<br> to Mae and the kids, Jim.<br> Go home? Go home with what?<br> Go home with what?

It was, like, $123.<br> We owed $118.<br> Left me with $5.<br> Makes you a rich man, huh?<br> Around here.<br> Good fight.<br> Thanks.<br> Dock seven.<br> Seven.<br> Hey, Jim.<br> Hey, Mike.<br> Good fight.<br> Thanks.<br> I wouldn't have hit Sara.<br> I know, Mike.<br> I couldn't live with myself<br> if I'd have hit her.<br> Just get so angry<br> with all this shit.<br> You know, if you were gonna<br> win, you could've told me.<br> If I knew I was gonna win,<br> I would've bet on myself.<br> Why can't you ever listen<br> to me? I don't know.<br> ...to determine whether<br> the strikers were willing...<br> to submit to<br> an arbitration situation.<br> Tension pervaded the New<br> York waterfront yesterday.<br> Why don't you go play<br> with the boys, sweetheart?<br> Be careful.<br> Hey, Rosy.<br> Hi, Daddy!<br> You know,<br> Joe Gould was just here.<br> Yeah, I saw.<br> You did?<br> He thinks the Commission<br> might be willing to...<br> reverse their ruling.<br> He thinks he can get me<br> another fight.<br> He wants me to stop working<br> and get back in shape.<br> I thought it was<br> just the one fight.<br> Well, yeah.<br> He fronted us $175<br> so I can train.<br> You know what that is<br> right there?<br> That's a second chance.<br> That's what that is.<br> It's not that<br> I'm not grateful...<br> or proud, honey.<br> I'm so proud of you.<br> But we got off easy<br> when you broke that hand.<br> We're back to even now.<br> Right. And nine months from<br> now, we're back in the same boat.<br> Baby, please.<br> We just don't have anything<br> left to risk.<br> Mae.<br> There's still some juice in these<br> legs, and I can still take a few.<br> Baby, please.<br> Just let me take them<br> in the ring.<br> At least I know<br> who's hitting me.<br> I'm gonna go<br> and tell the kids.<br> Jay! Guess what.<br> What?<br> I got another fight!<br> Who with?<br> I don't know, but he's<br> going down. Hey, Howard.<br> Jesus.<br> Joe, open the door.<br> Joe! Open the damn door!<br> Don't hide in your fancy<br> apartment. I want to talk to you.<br> You are not gonna make my husband<br> your punching bag all over again.<br> We are just getting by, and<br> you're taking him from his work...<br> like some bloodsucking<br> little leech!<br> And I will not let you get<br> him hurt again like that...<br> do you hear me?<br> I will not let you!<br> Guess you better come in.<br> How is it?<br> Too sweet per usual.<br> Really? Go figure.<br> Yours?<br> Nice, thanks.<br> Sorry about that.<br> You just don't want folks<br> to see you down is all.<br> I didn't know.<br> I mean, I thought that...<br> Yeah, no. That's the idea.<br> Always keep your hands up.<br> Sold the last of it<br> two days ago.<br> So Jimmy could train.<br> Why?<br> Sometimes you have<br> an instinct, Mae.<br> You see something<br> in a fighter.<br> You don't even know if it's real,<br> you're looking for it so bad.<br> Can't have no hope at all.<br> But this is crazy.<br> I mean, you don't even know<br> if you can get him a fight.<br> I'll get him a fight.<br> Believe me, if it's the last<br> thing I do, I'll get him a fight.<br> Honey. Go get us some<br> of those crackers, would you?<br> She looks good<br> wearing the pants.<br> Can you ever stop yours?<br> When he sets his mind<br> to a thing?<br> I wish I could.<br> See, I never know<br> who it's harder on...<br> them or us.<br> We have to wait for them<br> to fix everything.<br> And every day...<br> they feel like<br> they're failing us.<br> And really, it's just the<br> world that's failed, you know?<br> This is a lovely apartment. Thank you.<br> Now, what am I gonna go<br> and do that for?<br> You saw the papers.<br> News had to print extra copies<br> the day after Braddock's fight.<br> People are sentimental, you<br> know. Some people are sentimental.<br> Yeah, so tell me why I care.<br> You're still sore over the way<br> Braddock took down Griffin, fine.<br> I can understand that. It was a<br> heartbreak for a lot of people.<br> Yes. But look.<br> You got guys fighting<br> an elimination series...<br> over who gets a shot at Max Baer<br> for the championship in June.<br> John Henry Lewis,<br> he's your number two in line.<br> Now, he already defeated<br> Braddock once in Frisco, correct?<br> Say you put Braddock back<br> in the game against Lewis.<br> Lewis wins, you get your<br> revenge on Braddock...<br> and your boy has gotten<br> a topflight tune-up...<br> with full publicity before<br> Lasky, and what happens?<br> You make more money.<br> Now, say on the other hand, by<br> some minute, infinitesimal chance...<br> God forbid,<br> Braddock beats Lewis.<br> Now you got a sentimental<br> favorite go up...<br> and lose against Lasky,<br> and what happens?<br> You'll make more money.<br> James, either way...<br> you're a richer man with Braddock<br> back in the ring than if he's not.<br> Come on, don't be foolish. We<br> both know the name of this game.<br> And it sure as hell<br> ain't "pugilism. "<br> They ought to put your mouth<br> in a circus.<br> What do you say?<br> Don't chase him.<br> Go around, cut him off.<br> Time!<br> James!<br> I got you a fight.<br> Yeah?<br> You're gonna fight<br> John Henry Lewis again.<br> Yeah!<br> Joey! I could kiss you!<br> No, please,<br> not in front of the fellas.<br> Isn't John Henry<br> one of Johnston's boys?<br> You let me worry about that,<br> please.<br> Now I know why you won't kiss me.<br> You're all puckered out already.<br> Brother, you have no idea.<br> Lewis?<br> Kicked our ass in Frisco.<br> Yeah. Hey, Mike.<br> Who's "our ass" up there?<br> Joe Gould, Mike Wilson.<br> Mike Wilson, Joe Gould.<br> Hi.<br> That guy ain't been beat<br> in ten fights.<br> But you win on a long shot, and<br> that's a great payday for me.<br> That's great.<br> I'll keep that in mind, Mike!<br> You got more important things<br> to think about. Come here.<br> Now, I ain't gonna<br> bullshit you, all right?<br> Now, you win one,<br> I can get you another.<br> Win again and then things maybe<br> start getting serious around here.<br> Jimmy?<br> Win.<br> Look good.<br> Leverage.<br> That's it, James!<br> Be a bully, James!<br> Aggression, that's it.<br> Thanks.<br> I know this isn't<br> what you wanted...<br> but I can't win<br> without you behind me.<br> I'm always behind you.<br> Thank you, baby.<br> I got a great idea.<br> You want to come along?<br> Come on, just this one time.<br> All right. Okay.<br> Okay, I'll make that<br> a rain check then.<br> Lewis, still moving well here<br> in the fourth.<br> He dances in and out<br> before Braddock can react.<br> Don't let him<br> set the pace, Jimmy!<br> There you go.<br> Braddock slides to his right,<br> tries cutting down the ring.<br> John, get off the ropes.<br> Move out of there.<br> Lewis spins his way<br> off the ropes...<br> And looks to resume control<br> at the bell!<br> There we go. Suck it up.<br> Deep breath.<br> Deep breath, deep.<br> All right. That ain't bad. He's<br> even faster than I remember.<br> Yeah. He's fast. Big deal.<br> You're not so bad yourself.<br> What are you doing? You<br> beat this guy easy last time.<br> He ain't the same guy.<br> You got to use your speed.<br> Keep that jab in his face<br> and keep sliding to his right.<br> You see that.<br> Keep him in front of you.<br> Cut him off, all right?<br> And let go with the punches.<br> Hit him! He ain't gonna like it.<br> I guarantee you, the more<br> you hit this bastard...<br> the slower he's gonna get.<br> He's an old man. He's too<br> slow. He can't keep up with you.<br> Come on. Use that jab.<br> How's that cut?<br> He's all right.<br> Knock the legs out<br> from under him.<br> Trap him in the corner,<br> and really work him.<br> Do not fight this fight<br> his way.<br> You make him fight<br> this fight your way!<br> Let's go. You got him.<br> A left to the body<br> and a hard right to the head!<br> A left-right-left by Lewis.<br> His dancing shoes are off.<br> It's a fight now, folks!<br> Work his body, Jim!<br> Braddock punching well<br> with both hands now.<br> Toe to toe!<br> No one giving an inch.<br> That left has some pop!<br> Jimmy's hoping those body<br> shots will pay dividends.<br> Keep him in there!<br> Stay with him!<br> Don't give him any room!<br> No room!<br> Get out of the corner.<br> Braddock pushing<br> all the action now.<br> Lewis can't discourage him.<br> Tremendous pressure from Jimmy.<br> Lewis is running out of real<br> estate in this 24-foot ring.<br> Jump on him!<br> And Lewis is down!<br> Gotcha. Good boy.<br> Get up!<br> One.<br> There you go, get up!<br> Two.<br> Come on.<br> Three.<br> Four. Five.<br> Six.<br> The referee wipes his gloves<br> and Braddock steams<br> back to ring center!<br> Close it down.<br> Another big right by Braddock!<br> Lewis is just a piece of meat<br> as Braddock is carving him up!<br> Braddock is now dominating<br> Lewis! Here comes Jimmy!<br> Side to side!<br> Side to side!<br> In the tenth, riding high<br> after his dazzling victory...<br> over John Henry Lewis...<br> Jim Braddock has just hit<br> a wall named Art Lasky.<br> He can't keep taking<br> those body shots.<br> I know. He's cracked<br> a couple of ribs for sure.<br> Lasky walks through<br> those jabs...<br> and keeps working<br> on Braddock's body.<br> But Braddock won't fold!<br> He's making Lasky work hard<br> for every minute of every round.<br> That's it, get on him!<br> There you go, James!<br> That's it!<br> Lasky's starting to<br> impose his will.<br> He's showing why Jimmy<br> Johnston is making noises...<br> about matching him<br> with Max Baer for the title.<br> Break it up!<br> Come on. Break free.<br> Break.<br> Don't sit down. You're<br> not tired. You're fine.<br> Get that thing out of here!<br> He don't need it!<br> Is he looking over at you?<br> Shake your head<br> like you don't need it.<br> Shake your head like<br> you don't want it. There.<br> Why isn't he sitting down?<br> Pay attention.<br> Yeah, now he's gonna wonder:<br> "If Braddock is such an old<br> man, why is he still standing?<br> Why is he still<br> coming at me?"<br> You're stronger than this guy.<br> Don't back up! Don't back off!<br> This guy is a bull-rusher.<br> He's gonna keep coming at you<br> all night until you stop him.<br> He can't back up.<br> You stop him.<br> You gotta beat<br> this son of a bitch!<br> You gotta beat this son of<br> a bitch from the inside out!<br> You hear me?<br> You gotta get in there.<br> You get in there<br> and you hit him...<br> and you keep hitting him<br> until you break his nose.<br> You fill his face with blood.<br> Beat him from the inside<br> out, Jim! From the inside out!<br> Lasky continues to fire.<br> Braddock looks like<br> he's finally starting to wilt.<br> That's it!<br> That's more like it!<br> Back him up!<br> Lasky now looking<br> to put a Grimm ending...<br> to Braddock's<br> fairy-tale comeback.<br> Lasky pounding hard shots<br> to the body.<br> Braddock just took<br> a tremendous shot!<br> A hard right to the head<br> which knocked his mouthpiece...<br> to the canvas.<br> Braddock just took<br> Lasky's best shot!<br> And it didn't even faze him!<br> Get in there<br> and take that sucker!<br> He's showing<br> tremendous determination!<br> Right in there<br> and get his nose!<br> Braddock comes in<br> with a hard shot to the body!<br> The younger Lasky looks<br> like he's starting to wilt...<br> under the pressure from<br> the Bulldog of North Bergen.<br> Braddock is now<br> back on the attack!<br> Another vicious combination<br> by Braddock!<br> And Lasky's flowing blood<br> from the nose!<br> The 15th and final round.<br> Braddock now looks<br> like the younger fighter...<br> and grimly determined.<br> The Garden is on its feet! Jim<br> Braddock will not be denied!<br> There's the bell! This<br> one goes to the scorecards.<br> And the winner<br> by unanimous decision...<br> James J. Braddock!<br> Thanks, buddy.<br> Max?<br> What?<br> Save a little bit of it...<br> Jimmy Braddock<br> just beat Lasky.<br> They made him<br> the number one contender.<br> Max, when are we gonna go to... Shut up.<br> Maxie, you...<br> Shut up!<br> I'm not gonna fight Jimmy<br> Braddock. He's a chump.<br> You tell Johnston to bring me<br> somebody who can fight back.<br> You gonna bust your contract?<br> It's done, Max.<br> That's him? Yeah?<br> Yes, it is.<br> I'm telling you.<br> That's Braddock.<br> Hey, Mrs. Braddock.<br> Sara's here.<br> Yeah?<br> Yeah.<br> I got her to sleep.<br> Hey, Jim.<br> Mike's gone missing.<br> How long?<br> Three days.<br> I've been staying at my<br> brother's since Jake cut him.<br> Jake fired him?<br> I didn't know that.<br> You know how Mike gets.<br> All his talk. So much trouble.<br> He's been sleeping nights<br> down in the Hooverville.<br> My brother didn't have room<br> for both him and us.<br> Mike said, you know, if he had<br> to stay down there anyway...<br> he was gonna try<br> to get everybody organized.<br> Something's wrong, Jim.<br> I know it.<br> Now I'm hearing there's<br> some trouble in Hooverville.<br> He wouldn't leave me<br> and the baby for this long.<br> He just wouldn't.<br> I didn't know<br> who else to come to, Jim.<br> Come on, out of the way!<br> Beat it! Move along!<br> Get the hell out of here,<br> coppers!<br> Mike? Mike Wilson!<br> Mike Wilson!<br> ...do nothing. If you let<br> these Commies in here...<br> and start a riot, then what<br> do you think's gonna happen?<br> Get over here.<br> On your feet!<br> You pull a knife on me,<br> you son of a bitch?<br> What the hell happened here?<br> We tried to break up these<br> agitators, peaceful-like...<br> but they charged us.<br> What is this?<br> The horses got spooked.<br> Wagons turned over.<br> Three or four of them got run<br> over.

Would've been worse<br> if he was shorter.<br> Baer had to punch up to hit<br> him. Took a little something off.<br> That's Frankie Campbell.<br> Stand-up fighter,<br> knows how to take a punch.<br> His style familiar, Jim?<br> Like looking in a mirror, huh?<br> Hey, he don't need to see this.<br> He'll see it<br> or I'll call off the fight.<br> You see that combination?<br> Campbell didn't go down<br> on the first punch.<br> He was a tough guy.<br> Second one killed him<br> on the spot.<br> Just cut it off, will you?<br> The autopsy said that his<br> brain was knocked loose...<br> from the connecting tissue.<br> Consider your ass<br> fully covered, okay?<br> Run it again.<br> Remember Ernie Schaaf?<br> Nice guy.<br> You lost one to him in '31.<br> Ernie took one of those<br> on the chin from Baer.<br> He was dead<br> and didn't know it.<br> Next fight, first little nothing<br> jab put him to sleep forever.<br> Detached brain, they said.<br> Joe?<br> No snappy comeback?<br> It ain't my skull the guy's<br> gonna try and stove in.<br> You want to think about it?<br> You think<br> you're telling me something?<br> What, like, boxing's<br> dangerous, something like that?<br> You don't think triple shifts or<br> working nights on the scaffolds...<br> is just as likely<br> to get a guy killed?<br> How many guys died the other<br> night living in cardboard shacks...<br> trying to save on rent money?<br> Guys who were trying to feed their<br> family. 'Cause men like you...<br> have not yet quite figured out<br> a way to make money...<br> out of watching that guy die.<br> In my profession,<br> and it's my profession...<br> I'm a little more fortunate.<br> All righty then. You guys<br> have dinner here tonight.<br> Take your wives.

Come on!<br> You can do this.<br> This guy is made for you.<br> Have a picnic, all right?<br> There's the bell!<br> And the fight is on!<br> The boys come out...<br> and immediately Braddock<br> shoots a left to Maxie's jaw!<br> That's it!<br> Take it right to him, Jimmy!<br> Now, now.<br> Baer snaps Braddock's head<br> back with two right uppercuts.<br> It's always a question of which Max<br> will show up in the first round...<br> the killer or the clown?<br> Maxie doing well.<br> It looks like he's enjoying<br> himself, mugging for the crowd.<br> Take it into him!<br> A big flurry by Braddock!<br> A vicious right to the head!<br> Take it easy, pal. I'll let<br> it go a couple of rounds.<br> Madcap Maxie is heavily favored to<br> put the long snore on Braddock...<br> in the first round.<br> That big right hand of his<br> has dynamite in it...<br> especially when he traps<br> his man on the ropes.<br> He's gonna carry him<br> for a couple of rounds.<br> Braddock! Break it up!<br> Break it up, I said!<br> Go on, Jimmy!<br> Jim survived the round and<br> looked pretty good doing it.<br> Braddock will not be bullied.<br> Not tonight.<br> When he does this horseshit,<br> knock it off.<br> He's trying to thumb you.<br> All right?<br> And then slip inside of there<br> and shorten up the punches.<br> All right? Shorten them up.<br> That's your turf!<br> Inside is yours!<br> Good job, Braddock!<br> Come on, Braddock!<br> Well, no one expected Braddock<br> to go past the first round.<br> Shorten them up.<br> Stay inside of him.<br> The experts at ringside<br> were wrong again.<br> Shorten them up!<br> There's the bell!<br> And here we are<br> in the second round.<br> That had some salt on it!<br> Braddock lands a hard right<br> to the head.<br> Max swats him away<br> with cool contempt!<br> He appears to be<br> toying with Braddock.<br> There's no other word for it.<br> Max struts around the ring<br> without a care in the world.<br> Sharp, efficient, tough,<br> and short! Good.<br> Knock that on out.<br> And Max responds with<br> swinging rights and lefts.<br> All power punches from Maxie.<br> Break him!<br> And Braddock punches<br> right to the head!<br> Cover up!<br> Is that the right spot, Jimmy?<br> All right.<br> Break it up!<br> Break it up, you two!<br> Stay clean!<br> How are those ribs?<br> Okay. All right. Take it easy.<br> Good pace. Good pace, Jim.<br> Take it easy. Just breathe.<br> Deep breaths. Relax.<br> Good rhythm.<br> You're looking great<br> out there, Jimmy.<br> Yeah.<br> You look great.<br> Hey, Jim?<br> If he goes for your body...<br> drop the elbows on him.<br> Teach him a lesson.<br> Break his goddamn hand.<br> That round was tough to score.<br> Braddock landed several<br> surprising right hands.<br> And those thunderous<br> body punches by the champ...<br> should pay dividends<br> in the later rounds.<br> In the fifth,<br> Baer's smile is gone.<br> Yeah, that's it!<br> Jimmy comes in<br> with a hard right...<br> then neatly slides off<br> to Baer's left.<br> Avoiding the counterpunch,<br> Jimmy sticks a jab.<br> And now the crowd is jeering<br> and even laughing at the champ.<br> And Maxie's none too pleased.<br> All right, break it.<br> Break!<br> Baer backhands Braddock<br> across the face!<br> That'll cost Maxie.<br> You lousy shegetz!<br> That's a warning, Max.<br> I'm sorry.<br> How's that wife of yours?<br> Break!<br> She talk about me?<br> Knock off the wrestling.<br> All right. Break it up!<br> Quit fooling around, Max!<br> Low blow!<br> What was that?<br> Keep them up. Wake up,<br> you wet son of a bitch!<br> Max salutes the crowd.<br> He's one of a kind, folks.<br> She say my name in her sleep?<br> Baer took a chin-full of<br> Braddock's head in that clinch.<br> That's it! Work his body!<br> She miss me?<br> Baer grips Braddock's head<br> in a headlock.<br> Jesus! Hey, Maxila you<br> gonna punch him or pork him?<br> That's your job, asshole.<br> Jimmy fights his way free.<br> Hey, buddy...<br> Gets a shot in to the head.<br> You kidding me?<br> Fantastic!<br> You're gonna get hurt.<br> Braddock keeps punching. They<br> hammer each other, toe to toe.<br> Okay, break!<br> There's the bell!<br> Keep your hands up<br> and your mouth shut, Maxie.<br> You watching the fight or<br> the cute guy in the front row?<br> Take a seat, Maxie!<br> He's nothing, nobody.<br> The guy has got nothing!<br> Jesus! Sit down!<br> Give me the sponge.<br> What are you doing?<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Well, quit screwing around.<br> Hey! Relax.<br> Give me the goddamn water.<br> Ten seconds!<br> Hit this guy. Cut him!<br> You cut him down to size.<br> Cut him!<br> Oh, shit.<br> In the seventh,<br> the boys come out again.<br> And Max is all business now.<br> Put him away, Max!<br> Get him!<br> Attaboy, Maxie! Attaboy!<br> Slide it, Jimmy!<br> Braddock starting<br> to look his age here...<br> as Baer pushes him<br> around the ring.<br> Baer swings hard to the body.<br> Braddock gets in a right<br> to the head.<br> Murder him, Maxie!<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Baer with a tremendous shot<br> right there!<br> That was the hardest blow<br> in the fight!<br> Oh, Christ.<br> Baer turns him again...<br> with another right to the head.<br> Another right. And another.<br> Push him, push him!<br> Braddock gets in<br> a vicious uppercut.<br> Baer keeps on punching!<br> Jesus, Johnny!<br> Let him go! That's enough!<br> Break it up!<br> You're gonna go home<br> in butcher paper, pal!<br> To your corners!<br> Butcher paper!<br> All right.<br> Let me see that nose.<br> Get it out.<br> You're okay.<br> Let me see it.<br> Tilt your head back.<br> That's nothing.<br> That's a piece of cake.<br> Keep your head up.<br> Breathe through your mouth.<br> Breathe.<br> You got all your ugly friends<br> down from Jersey here.<br> They're dressed up nice.<br> They've come to see you.<br> You're putting them to sleep.<br> You're not turning him anymore.<br> Come on, pick it up.<br> Spit that out, boy-o.<br> Good boy.<br> Come on.<br> The boys go after each other<br> immediately.<br> Braddock gets in a left to<br> the body. And a hard right...<br> Mae.<br> ... to Max's head.<br> Baer comes swinging across<br> with a long, swinging...<br> It's the cops.<br> ... right to Braddock's head.<br> Braddock stumbles away.<br> Baer tries that right again!<br> They come together. Braddock<br> swings a left and a right.<br> Please, Ma.<br> Max comes back with a left<br> and a right of his own.<br> Braddock sticks out a left!<br> Baer still after him.<br> Another left!<br> And a hard right by Braddock<br> that rocked Baer for a moment!<br> Baer tries that right again.<br> A hard right<br> to Braddock's head!<br> Braddock is hurt.<br> His legs are gone.<br> Braddock sticks out a left!<br> Another left!<br> Neither man will back down!<br> It's a slugfest, folks!<br> And there's the bell!<br> James J. Braddock has<br> exhibited a lot of heart here...<br> over 11 grueling rounds<br> with the champion.<br> Nobody expected him to last more<br> than a few innings with Baer.<br> Yet here he is.<br> And he's held his own.<br> But now we head into the<br> championship rounds, folks.<br> Hey, Jim, look at me.<br> I swear to God, boy,<br> win, lose or draw...<br> Thanks, Joey.<br> For all of it.<br> You son of a bitch.<br> All right. Stop talking.<br> Get in there!<br> And bury him!<br> Finish him off.<br> Come on, Jimmy!<br> Here in the 12th,<br> James J. Braddock...<br> is showing this crowd<br> what heart is all about.<br> Jimmy seems to be<br> timing that left...<br> and has slapped it away<br> several times.<br> Keep moving, boy-o!<br> You stay with him!<br> Son of a bitch!<br> Braddock with a shoeshine.<br> Left, right!<br> Am I seeing what I'm seeing?<br> Finish him, Jimmy. Finish him!<br> Braddock, Braddock!<br> Maxie's glamour-boy smile<br> is now a bloody grimace.<br> This crowd is desperately<br> hoping for a Braddock victory.<br> But Mr. Baer might have<br> something to say about that.<br> Holy crap!<br> Low blow!<br> That last low blow<br> will cost you the round, Max.<br> Jesus!<br> Lt'll cost you the round.<br> Why don't you just kick him<br> in the balls, huh?<br> Joe, back in your corner!<br> What are you afraid of,<br> you son of a bitch?<br> Get back to your corner!<br> Come on, Ref!<br> McAvoy is on the verge of<br> losing control of this fight.<br> Knock him on the ground,<br> Bulldog!<br> Last round.<br> That's right!

Come on!<br> Right hand, Max. Yes!<br> What is he, stupid?<br> Step away!<br> Braddock trying to survive<br> this brutal onslaught!<br> Stay off him!<br> Don't let him touch you!<br> Hey, looking good, Maxie!<br> Watch the uppercut! Just<br> stay the hell away from him!<br> Baer cutting loose<br> with thunderous shots.<br> A left to the body.<br> Baer again with a right!<br> Braddock covering up,<br> trying to hang on.<br> Baer looking for the knockout.<br> He doesn't want this one<br> to go to the cards, folks.<br> They pound each other<br> with lefts and rights.<br> Braddock blocking<br> with his gloves and elbows.<br> Snaps a big right<br> to Maxie's jaw!<br> Baer smashes him<br> with a big right!<br> Braddock is back on the ropes.<br> Braddock lands<br> a crushing right.<br> Maxie desperately wants<br> to keep the crown...<br> from slipping away.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Stay with him!<br> Both fighters are tired.<br> Baer is trying wildly<br> for the knockout!<br> But Jimmy is still standing...<br> and he's not only standing,<br> he's moving forward.<br> This is the finish.<br> Both boys are tired.<br> This is not boxing, folks.<br> This is a walloping ballet.<br> Ten seconds!<br> Time's up!<br> Son of a bitch.<br> That is the bell!
