Get in touch<br> with anybody who knew him...<br> ...or knew him well.<br> That manager of his...<br> Bernstein. His second wife.<br> She's still living.<br> Susan Alexander Kane.<br> - She runs a nightclub in Atlantic City.<br> - That's right.<br> See them all. Get in touch with everybody<br> that ever worked for him...<br> ...whoever loved him,<br> whoever hated his guts.<br> I don't mean go through<br> the city directory of course.<br> I'll get on it right away.<br> Good. Rosebud, dead or alive.<br> It will probably turn out to be<br> a very simple thing.<br> Miss Alexander.<br> This is Mr. Thompson, Miss Alexander.<br> I want another drink, John.<br> Right away.<br> Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?<br> - I'll have a highball, please.<br> - Who told you you could sit down?<br> I thought maybe we could have a talk.<br> Think again.<br> Can't you people leave me alone?<br> I'm minding my own business,<br> you mind yours.<br> If I could just have a talk with you,<br> Miss Alexander. I'd...<br> Get out of here.<br> Get out!<br> - Sorry.<br> - Get out.<br> - Maybe some other time.<br> - Get out.<br> Gino.<br> Get her another highball.<br> She just won't talk to nobody,<br> Mr. Thompson.<br> Okay.<br> - Another double?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hello, I want New York City.<br> Courtland 79970.<br> This is Atlantic City 46827. All right.<br> She's...<br> She'll snap out of it.<br> Why, until he died, she'd just as soon<br> talk about Mr. Kane as any...<br> - Hello.<br> - Sooner.<br> This is Thompson. Let me talk to the chief.<br> Mr. Rawlston? She won't talk.<br> The second Mrs. Kane.<br> About Rosebud or anything else.<br> I'm calling from Atlantic City.<br> Tomorrow I'll go to Philadelphia,<br> to Thatcher Library, to see his diary.<br> They're expecting me.<br> Then I've a meeting with his<br> general manager in New York. Bernstein.<br> Then I'm coming back here.<br> Yeah, I'll see everybody that's still alive.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Hey...<br> - John.<br> You just might be able to help me.<br> When she used to talk about Mr. Kane,<br> did she ever mention Rosebud?<br> "Rosebud"?<br> Thank you, Mr. Thompson, thanks.<br> As a matter of fact, just the other day,<br> when the papers were full of it...<br> ...I asked her.<br> She never heard of Rosebud.<br> The directors of the Thatcher Memorial<br> Library have asked me to remind you...<br> ...about the conditions<br> under which you may...<br> ...inspect certain portions<br> of Mr. Thatcher's unpublished memoirs.<br> - I remember them.<br> - Yes, Jennings, I'll bring him in.<br> - All I want is an hour...<br> - Under no circumstances...<br> ...are direct quotes from his manuscript<br> to be used by you. You may follow me.<br> That's all right. I'm just looking for...<br> Jennings.<br> Thank you, Jennings.<br> You will be required to leave this room<br> at 4:30 promptly.<br> You will confine yourself,<br> it is our understanding...<br> ...to the chapters in Mr. Thatcher's<br> manuscript regarding Mr. Kane.<br> That's all I'm interested in.<br> Thank you.<br> Pages 83 to 142.<br> Come on, boys.<br> Be careful, Charles.<br> Mrs. Kane.<br> Pull your muffler around your neck,<br> Charles.<br> Mrs. Kane,<br> I think we'll have to tell him now.<br> Yes, I'll sign those papers now,<br> Mr. Thatcher.<br> You people seem to forget<br> that I'm the boy's father.<br> It's going to be done<br> exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.<br> There's nothing wrong with Colorado.<br> I don't see why we can't raise our son...<br> ...just 'cause we came into money.<br> If I want to, I can go to court.<br> A father has a right to.<br> A boarder that beats his bill<br> and leaves worthless stock behind...<br> That property is as much my property<br> as anybody's...<br> ...now that it's valuable.<br> And if Fred Graves had any idea...<br> ...this would happen, he'd have made out<br> the certificates in both our names.<br> - But they're made out to Mrs. Kane.<br> - He owed the money to both of us.<br> - "The bank's decision in all matters... "<br> - I don't hold with giving Charles to a bank...<br> - Stop this nonsense.<br> - We're a bit uneducated...<br> "The bank's decision<br> concerning his education...<br> "... his places of residence, is to be final. "<br> - The idea of a bank being the guardian...<br> - Stop this nonsense, Jim.<br> "We will assume full management<br> of the Colorado Lode"...<br> ...which I repeat, Mrs. Kane,<br> you are the sole owner.<br> - Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?<br> - Right here.<br> Mary, I'm asking you for the last time.<br> You'd think I hadn't been<br> a good husband or father...<br> The sum of $50,000 a year...<br> ...is to be paid to you<br> and Mr. Kane as long as you both live...<br> ...and thereafter to the survivor.<br> - Let's hope it's all for the best.<br> - It is.<br> Why I can't raise my own boy<br> is more than I can understand.<br> Go on, Mr. Thatcher.<br> Everything else, the principal,<br> as well as all monies earned...<br> ...is to be administered by the bank in trust<br> for your son, Charles Foster Kane...<br> ...until he reaches his 25th birthday,<br> at which time...<br> ...he is to come into complete possession.<br> Charles!<br> Go on, Mr. Thatcher.<br> It's almost 5:00.<br> Don't you think I'd better meet the boy?<br> I've got his trunk all packed.<br> I've had it packed for a week now.<br> I've arranged for a tutor<br> to meet us in Chicago.<br> I'd have brought him here with me, but...<br> - Charles.<br> - Look, Mom.<br> You'd better come inside.<br> - That's quite a snowman.<br> - I took the pipe out of his mouth.<br> Did you make it yourself?<br> Maybe I'll make some teeth and whiskers.<br> This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.<br> - Hello.<br> - How do you do, Charles?<br> He comes from the East.<br> - Pa.<br> - Hello, Charlie.<br> Charles.<br> Yes, Mommy.<br> Mr. Thatcher is going to take you<br> on a trip with him tonight.<br> You'll be leaving on number 10.<br> That's the train with all the lights on it.<br> You going, Mom?<br> No. Your mother won't be going<br> right away, but she'll...<br> Where am I going?<br> You're going to see Chicago and New York<br> and Washington, maybe. Ain't he?<br> He certainly is.<br> I wish I were a boy going on a trip<br> like that for the first time.<br> - Why aren't you coming with us, Mom?<br> - We have to stay here, Charles.<br> You're gonna live with Mr. Thatcher<br> from now on, Charlie.<br> You're gonna be rich. Your ma figures,<br> well, that is...<br> ...me and her decided this ain't the place<br> for you to grow up in.<br> You'll probably be<br> the richest man someday...<br> ...and you ought to get...<br> - You won't be lonely.<br> Lonely, of course not. We're going to have<br> fine times together, we are.<br> Let's shake hands. Come.<br> I'm not that frightening, am I?<br> - What do you say? Let's shake.<br> - Why, Charles.<br> - Why, you almost hurt me.<br> - Charlie!<br> Sleds aren't to hit people,<br> but to sleigh with.<br> Mom!<br> - You got to go.<br> - Jim!<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Thatcher.<br> What the kid needs is a good thrashing.<br> - That's what you think, is it?<br> - Yes.<br> That's why he's going to be brought up<br> where you can't get at him.<br> Well, Charles...<br> ...Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> And a happy New Year.<br> In closing...<br> ...may I remind you your 25th birthday,<br> which is now approaching...<br> ...marks your complete independence<br> from the firm...<br> ...of Thatcher & Company,<br> as well as acquiring the full responsibility...<br> ...for the world's sixth largest<br> private fortune.<br> - Got that?<br> - "The world's sixth largest private fortune. "<br> I don't think you realize the full importance<br> of the position you are to occupy.<br> I am therefore enclosing<br> for your consideration...<br> ...a list of your holdings,<br> extensively cross-indexed.<br> - "Dear Mr. Thatcher.

"<br> I guess he couldn't help it.<br> She must have had something for him.<br> That first night, according to Charlie...<br> ...all she had was a toothache.<br> What are you laughing at, young lady?<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Toothache.<br> - What?<br> - Toothache.<br> Toothache?<br> You mean you've got a toothache.<br> - What's funny about that?<br> - You're funny, mister.<br> - You've got dirt on your face.<br> - Not dirt, it's mud.<br> Do you want some hot water?<br> I live right here.<br> What's that, young lady?<br> I said, if you wanted some hot water...<br> ...I could get you some... hot water.<br> All right, thank you very much.<br> Do I look any better now?<br> - This medicine doesn't do a bit of good.<br> - What you need is to get your mind off it.<br> Excuse me, but my landlady<br> prefers me to keep this door open...<br> ...when I have a gentleman caller.<br> - All right.<br> You have got a toothache, haven't you?<br> - I surely have.<br> - Why don't you try laughing at me again?<br> - What?<br> - I'm still pretty funny.<br> I know, but you don't want me<br> to laugh at you.<br> I don't want your tooth to hurt, either.<br> Look at me.<br> See that?<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm wiggling both my ears<br> at the same time.<br> That's it, smile.<br> It took me two solid years at the best<br> boys' school in the world to learn that.<br> The fellow who taught me<br> is now president of Venezuela.<br> That's it!<br> - Is it a giraffe?<br> - No, not a giraffe.<br> - I bet it is.<br> - What?<br> Well, then it's an elephant.<br> - It's supposed to be a rooster.<br> - A rooster!<br> You know an awful lot of tricks.<br> Are you a professional magician?<br> - No, I'm not a magician.<br> - I was just joking.<br> You really don't know who I am?<br> You told me your name, Mr. Kane,<br> but I'm awfully ignorant.<br> I guess you caught on to that.<br> I bet I've heard your name a million times.<br> You really like me, though,<br> even though you don't know who I am?<br> I surely do. You've been wonderful.<br> Without you I don't know<br> what I would have done.<br> I had a toothache,<br> and I don't know many people.<br> I know too many people.<br> I guess we're both lonely.<br> Want to know what I was going to do<br> before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?<br> I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.<br> You probably have more.<br> I was just joking.<br> I was on my way<br> to the Western Manhattan Warehouse...<br> ...in search of my youth.<br> You see, my mother died a long time ago.<br> Her things were put in storage out West.<br> There wasn't any other place to put them.<br> I thought I'd send for them now.<br> Tonight I was going to take a look at them.<br> A sort of sentimental journey.<br> I run a couple of newspapers.<br> What do you do?<br> Me?<br> - How old did you say you were?<br> - I didn't say.<br> If you had, I wouldn't have asked you.<br> - How old?<br> - Pretty old.<br> - How old?<br> - Twenty-two in August.<br> That's a ripe old age. What do you do?<br> I work at Seligman's.<br> I'm in charge of the sheet music.<br> - Is that what you want to do?<br> - No, I wanted to be a singer, I guess.<br> - That is, I didn't. My mother did for me.<br> - What happened to the singing?<br> Mother always thought, she always talked<br> about grand opera for me.<br> Imagine.<br> But my voice isn't that kind.<br> It's just, you know what mothers are like.<br> Yes.<br> - Have you got a piano?<br> - A piano?<br> Yes, there's one in the parlor.<br> - Would you sing for me?<br> - You wouldn't want to hear me sing.<br> Yes, I would.<br> Don't tell me<br> your toothache is bothering you.<br> No, that's all gone.<br> All right.<br> Let's go to the parlor.<br> "Yes, Lindor shall be mine<br> "I have sworn it<br> "For weal or woe<br> "Yes, Lindor<br> "Lo giurai<br> "La vincer"<br> There is only one man<br> who can rid the politics...<br> ...of this state of the evil domination<br> of Boss Jim Gettys.<br> I am speaking of Charles Foster Kane,<br> the fighting liberal...<br> ...the friend of the workingman,<br> the next governor of this state...<br> ...who entered upon this campaign...<br> ...with one purpose only:<br> To point out<br> and make public the dishonesty...<br> ...the downright villainy<br> of Boss Jim W.

Until a few weeks ago.<br> I had no hope of being elected.<br> Now. However.
