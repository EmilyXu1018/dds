Andale!<br> Yeah!<br> Yeah!<br> /Whoa!<br> He's after me!<br> Phil!<br> - Whoa!<br> - Whoa!<br> Jesus!<br> Ed!<br> Go, Mitch!<br> Stay, bull. Stay, bull.<br> Stay, bull!<br> Stop following me!<br> Please!<br> Does he know what he's doing?<br> Has he any idea what he's doing?<br> Ow.<br> Relax.<br> He's doing a beautiful job.<br> Sir. El doctor.<br> Hello!<br> Don't sew up anything that's<br> supposed to remain open, OK?<br> Si.<br> - What, are you taking pictures, Phil?<br> - Are you kiddin'? This is a Kodak moment. Now, smile.<br> Oh, good.<br> Blind him with the flash.<br> Phil, let the man keep<br> what's left of his dignity, please.<br> - "Dignity." This is all your fault, Ed.<br> - My fault?<br> - You're a macho lunatic. Phil & I are sheep.<br> - We're not sheep.<br> - We do every stupid thing he asks!<br> - I didn't make you run.<br> No, it was a 2,000lb rampaging animal<br> spraying bull snot all over Spain.<br> That's what made me run.<br> You made me stand in front of it.<br> Come on, guys.<br> Group shot.<br> I got a big "I told you so"<br> coming from Barbara.<br> Maybe she won't notice.<br> - Honey, want a pillow? It's a long flight.<br> - No, thanks.<br> Come on, it's not that bad.<br> I look like your mother.<br> Here comes Mr Bull.<br> Kim, baby, do you want<br> the aisle or the window seat?<br> - Whatever you want makes me happy.<br> - I don't care.<br> Good, then take the window.<br> I wanna talk to Mitch.<br> - Be right back.<br> - Miss me.<br> Admit it, pal.<br> You had fun.<br> No. Scuba diving is fun.<br> I mean that's normal. People do that.<br> Baseball fantasy camp, until Phil<br> threw up on Willie Mays, was fabulous.<br> - I was nervous. He was my idol.<br> - I'll never forget Willie's face.<br> "Say, hey. That's lunch on me."<br> - Phil. I'm standing.<br> - Yes, dear.<br> Can't wait to get out of this country.<br> Maybe it's just me, but I think our little<br> adventures lately are becoming... stupid.<br> What did you call them?<br> - "Desperate attempt<br> to cling to your youth."<br> - That's bullshit.<br> - Bullshit? Ed, have you noticed...<br> ...the older you get,<br> the younger your girlfriends get?<br> Soon, you'll be dating sperm.<br> - I'm back.<br> - OK. I have just one more thing to say.<br> - Target parachute jumping.<br> - Ed!<br> Now, it's a smaller parachute,<br> but you're travelling twice as fast.<br> Great! When they find your body,<br> they can bury it in a sucrets box.<br> - Phil said he'd go.<br> - Phil wants to die.<br> If you were married to that,<br> you'd wanna die too.<br> He's pretending to be asleep<br> so he doesn't have to talk to her.<br> It's a couple of little jumps from a plane.<br> And then what? We go on safari, only<br> the animals have guns and they hunt us?<br> - Forget about it.<br> - It's never enough for you, Ed.<br> - I'm reading.<br> - When's it ever gonna be enough?<br> - Hi, Mom.<br> /It's september 8th, 1952.<br> /We're driving back from<br> /your Aunt Marsha. My water breaks.<br> /Your father jumps the divider<br> /of the sawmill River parkway...<br> /... and races me to Doctors' Hospital and...<br> /... at 5.16, out you came.<br> /Ohh...<br> /Happy birthday, darling.<br> /- Here's your father.<br> /- Hello, boy. Happy birthday.<br> - Hi, Dad, how are you?<br> /- I'm losing feeling in my left leg.<br> /- Here's your mother.<br> /- Don't worry. He's fine.<br> /So, what are you gonna<br> /do now, birthday boy?<br> I thought I'd lie here another three<br> and a half hours, and then go to work.<br> /- Is Barbara with you?<br> - No, she's working the streets.<br> She has her breakfast with her pimp.<br> She'll be in around 7.30.<br> - Hi, Mom.<br> /- Give my boy a kiss.<br> /I can't believe my baby's 39 years old.<br> Bye, Mom.<br> /Oh, bye.<br> /Angel, birthday boy.<br> Happy birthday.<br> Well, at least she said my age in years.<br> Usually she uses months,<br> like I'm still an infant.<br> "How's Mitch?"<br> "Oh, good. He's 468 months today."<br> Wow.<br> I look a year older.<br> Do I look a year older to you?<br> Honey, at 5.15,<br> everybody looks a year older.<br> - Do you know what I found yesterday?<br> - Hm?<br> - Hair in my ear.<br> - Mitch.<br> I'm losing hair where I want hair,<br> and getting one where it shouldn't be hair.<br> I found four big fat ones on my back.<br> I'm starting to look like the fly.<br> That's it. I'm cancelling<br> your birthday party.<br> - Why?<br> - Cos your birthdays depress you.<br> - No, they don't.<br> - Oh, Mitch.<br> On your 30th birthday,<br> you said you couldn't see.<br> On your 34th birthday,<br> you forgot my name for an hour.<br> Last year, when I asked you<br> what you wanted...<br> ...you said a CAT scan.<br> - I had a headache.<br> - This year, let's just let it pass.<br> - I wanna see my friends.<br> - All right.<br> But I don't want people coming over here<br> thinking they're in a Bergman film.<br> "You've met my husband, Mr Death?"<br> - I'll be good.<br> - Yeah?<br> Cos I don't need you<br> any worse than you've been.<br> - Wait a second. What does that mean?<br> - Nothing.<br> "Nothing."<br> Great.<br> Got a minute?<br> Hi. Only if a few minutes.<br> I have career day at Danny's school.<br> Yeah, it'll just take a second.<br> What is it?<br> / Pizza Guy, Pizza Guy<br> / Come on down to Pizza Guy<br> / Be a happy, happy fella<br> / Have some sauce and mozzarella<br> / At Pizza Guy<br> - So?<br> - So.<br> So, it's stupid.<br> It's annoying.<br> - It makes people change the station.<br> - I didn't write it.<br> You bought it. You put it on the air<br> three times a night in a prime time.<br> People are having accidents.<br> You used to go out and get advertising.<br> You hustled.<br> You were creative.<br> Something bad came in, you fixed it.<br> You rewrote it.<br> You worked with it.<br> My God, we used to make fun of guys<br> who bought crap like this.<br> What's going on with you?<br> Did you ever reach a point<br> in your life where you think...<br> ..."This is the best I'm ever gonna<br> look, the best I'm ever gonna feel...<br> ...the best I'm ever gonna do,<br> and it ain't that great"?<br> - Happy birthday.<br> - Thank you.<br> Look, I'm the station manager.<br> I'm responsible... for the quality<br> of work here at the station...<br> ...so, until further notice, I shall<br> personally approve all the new spots.<br> What? I can't make a deal<br> without checking with you first?<br> Just till you get back on track.<br> So we're doing this job<br> on 60th and 3rd...<br> ...big friggin' ballbreaker<br> of a job, right?<br> We got the area roped off so<br> that some schmuck don't walk in...<br> ...and take a wreckin' ball<br> between the eyes.<br> All of a sudden, this woman, with the big,<br> dark glasses, the Bloomingdale's bags...<br> ...she starts walkin' through the ropes.<br> I yelled down at her "Hey, you<br> can't go there, you stupid bitch!"<br> Suddenly, this big steam fitting bursts...<br> ...and this enormous goddamn crane<br> crashes right down on her legs...<br> ...and she's screaming "My legs! My legs!"<br> And I say "No shit, your legs. You got<br> a 2,000lb goddamn crane on'em."<br> Now, do you know how, in an emergency,<br> you can get superhuman strength?<br> I reach down and I lift this crane...<br> ...and Ernesto's able<br> to slide her out from under...<br> ...and the doctors were<br> able to save her legs!<br> So the moral is... don't walk<br> where you're not supposed to walk...<br> ...because there may not be somebody<br> with superhuman strength to save you.<br> And don't do drugs.<br> That's it.<br> Thank you, Mr Morelli.<br> That was... very descriptive.<br> Daniel, would you introduce your father,<br> please, and tell us what he does?<br> My Dad's named Mitch and he's...<br> ...he's a submarine commander.<br> Danny.<br> He works for WBLM radio.<br> Well, like Danny said,<br> I work for WBLM radio.<br> - Are you a disc jockey?<br> - No, I'm not a disc jockey.<br> You know the commercials<br> that are on the radio?<br> Do you make all those commercials?<br> No. Other people<br> make the commercials.<br> I sell them time on our station<br> for the commercials to be on.<br> So you decide which<br> commercials to use and when.<br> That's right. Well, no, it's<br> not right. It used to be right.<br> Seems now that I have to check with the<br> station manager if I wanna wipe my nose.<br> The minute he took away<br> my authority, I shoulda quit.<br> Mr Robbins?<br> What?<br> Value this time in your life, kids.<br> This is the time in your life<br> when you still have your choices.<br> It goes by so fast.<br> When you're a teenager, you think<br> you can do anything, and you do.<br> Your 20s are a blur. 30s, you raise<br> your family, you make a little money...<br> ...and you think to yourself<br> "What happened to my 20s?"<br> another chin. The music gets too loud.<br> An old girlfriend from high school<br> becomes a grandmother.<br> call it a "procedure", but it's a surgery.<br> The music is still loud...<br> ...but you can't hear it anyway.<br> retire to Fort Lauderdale.<br> You eat dinner at two in the afternoon...<br> ...lunch around ten,<br> breakfast the night before.<br> You spend most of your time in malls<br> looking for the ultimate soft yoghurt...<br> ...and muttering<br> "How come the kids don't call?"<br> The 80s, you'll have a major stroke. You<br> end up babbling to a Jamaican nurse...<br> ...that your wife can't stand<br> but who you call "Momma".<br> Any questions?<br> Danny was embarrassed<br> to tell the class what my job is.<br> They're nine! They get excited about the<br> guy who gives them change at the arcade.<br> You just happen to have one<br> of those jobs that's difficult to...<br> Believe that a grown man<br> does without losing his mind.<br> Well, what is my job?<br> I sell advertising time on the radio.<br> Basically, I sell air.<br> At least my father was an upholsterer.<br> He made a sofa, coach you can sit on it.<br> What can I point to?<br> Where's my work? It's air. I sell air.<br> So what are you saying?<br> You wanna quit?<br> How can I quit?<br> I'm trapped.<br> - You're trapped?<br> - Yeah. You want to send Holly...<br> ...to a performing arts school.<br> - She's got talent.<br> Hellen, she was in one play,<br> and she fell off the stage.<br> That's not talent, that's gravity.<br> And that school costs money.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I'm sleeping at Gwen's.<br> Again?<br> Are you paying rent there?<br> - Dad.<br> - We're having a birthday party.<br> - I don't wanna hang out with your friends.<br> - I told her it'd be all right.<br> We'll have a family party tomorrow.<br> - Bye, Dad. Happy birthday.<br> - Thank you.<br> Let me show you<br> how I pop my shoulder.<br> Danny. Dan.<br> Come on.<br> He's in the gifted programme at school.<br> Come on, go to sleep.<br> Kim, you poor thing. What has married<br> life done to you? You look like hell!<br> Six months. Admit it. You didn't<br> think Ed would ever get married.<br> He met the right woman.<br> - How often are you meeting that woman?<br> - You're lucky it's your birthday, pal.<br> Excuse me, I see one<br> of the guests is stealing.<br> Your husband is so cute.<br> You must laugh all day.<br> Yeah.<br> My sides hurt.<br> We saw a picture of you<br> in a newspaper in your underwear.<br> Oh, that was an advertisement.<br> I sometimes model ladies' underwear.<br> - You looked great.<br> - Mom...<br> ...you said "Let's see how<br> she looks after having two kids."<br> Daniel, time to go to bed.<br> We'll wake you for your wedding.<br> Phil. Psst.<br> Hello.<br> You're pretending<br> to sleep at my birthday party.<br> Is she around?<br> She's in the kitchen.<br> This is quite a life you've carved out for yourself, Phil.<br> Phil! Phil!<br> We're leaving.<br> We haven't had cake.<br> He hasn't even opened his presents yet.<br> Phil, you have to open the store<br> at 4.30. Daddy's counting on you.<br> Starting now.<br> You manage a supermarket,<br> that's when the food arrives.<br> Don't you have an assistant<br> or a kid or somethin'?<br> Arlene's father likes me to do it.<br> "No free rides, Philly boy.<br> No free rides."<br> I'm tellin' you, they got me by the balls.<br> She's got one, he's got the other.<br> Do you ever think about quitting?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Right.<br> That's just what I wanna do.<br> Start over, with two kids to take care of.<br> No. At this age,<br> where you are, you are.<br> - Hey, look who's awake.<br> - Look, I have got 14 minutes...<br> ...so can we give him the present?<br> - Yeah.<br> What'd you get me?<br> Two weeks. The three of us.<br> New Mexico. Driving cattle.<br> - What? Like in a truck?<br> - No, no! Cowboys.<br> - It's a real old-fashioned cattle drive.<br> - We drive the herd to Colorado.<br> - You can do this?<br> - We ride, we sleep out under the stars.<br> - Show him the brochure.<br> - It's fantastic, Mitch.<br> It's the newest thing.<br> People do this!<br> Wow.<br> Look at this.<br> - Real horses!<br> - Does look good.<br> "Good"? It's great. Cowboys -<br> it's what you always wanted to be.<br> - Remember Mitchy the Kid?<br> - Right! Mitchy the Kid!<br> And it's right when your vacation<br> comes. We've been planning it for weeks.<br> I can't do it.<br> - Why?<br> - We're going Florida to visit Barbara's parents.<br> - What, are you sick?<br> - No, it's planned already. I promised.<br> I worked every weekend for a year<br> to get this. What's with you these days?<br> Nothing.<br> You know, nothing.<br> It's just, I...<br> I don't wanna disappoint Barbara.<br> Who is that? I know nine people<br> and they're all here. Excuse me.<br> - Hi.<br> - Um, is Mr Phil Berquist here?<br> Can I get you something to...<br> Your housekeeper told me<br> where you were. I'm in trouble.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Who's on register nine?<br> - I don't know what to do.<br> - Rumaki?<br> - This isn't the time to talk about this.<br> - I'm late.<br> - What?<br> - I missed my period.<br> - What?<br> - I was at work and on my break...<br> ...and I took a home<br> pregnancy test from aisle 11.<br> - The ones on special?<br> - Yes! And it came out blue.<br> Why is she telling you this... Phil?<br> Because I'm... I'm her boss...<br> ...and we have a health plan.<br> Son of a bitch! You screwed<br> this little girl in my father's store?<br> - No, no, no!<br> - It was in his car!<br> Oh, Jesus!<br> And I'm not a little girl.<br> I'm 20.<br> Get out of this house, you little whore.<br> Hey! I will not permit you<br> to talk to her that way.<br> Fine.<br> - I'll tell my father what you did.<br> - No! Do not call Mr Levine.<br> - Hey! Put down that phone. Put it down.<br> - No!

Thank you.<br> I'm married.<br> You're wrong, Ed. I'm tellin' you.<br> It was not a stupid thing to say.<br> It was. She says "Thanks"<br> and you say "I'm married"?<br> Yeah.<br> I don't want any false flirtings.<br> "False flirtings"?<br> What if you're like me?<br> What if you don't encourage them<br> and they still chase you?<br> It doesn't happen. Women need a reason<br> to have sex. Men just need a place.<br> - Good night. I'm going to bed.<br> - Good night. Sleep tight.<br> - That was flirting.<br> - No. That was politeness.<br> That was "Have a pleasant and restly evening."<br> No. That was "I like your ass.<br> Could I wear it as a hat?"<br> Say, uh... Phil was telling us you<br> had a little trouble with Jeff and TR.<br> - They were giving Bonnie a hard time.<br> - But he took care of it.<br> What made it worse was,<br> the trail boss comes over...<br> Curly?<br> His name is Curly?<br> Perfect.<br> You know what the cook said about him?<br> He killed a man in a knife fight.<br> He said he slit him from neck to nuts.<br> I'm not happy about this.<br> This guy's a cowboy.<br> One of the last real men.<br> He's untamed.<br> A mustang.<br> We're trained ponies. It'll do us<br> good to be in his world a while.<br> - "Do us good"? He was hanging the help.<br> - He was helping us.<br> This guy is not normal. Did you see<br> his eyes? He's got crazy eyes.<br> He's a lunatic. I'm tleein' you, we're going into<br> the wilderness being led by a lunatic.<br> He's behind me, isn't he?<br> - Time to turn in.<br> - Good night.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean anything by that.<br> I crap bigger than you.<br> He's gonna kill me.<br> Watch it!<br> Excuse me. Whoa.<br> - Whoa!<br> - Great! You are riding so much better.<br> Thanks.<br> I just talked to, uh... Nancy.<br> - Who's Nancy?<br> - She's the, uh... the girl.<br> Oh, the, uh... the girl.<br> - She's not pregnant.<br> - Really?<br> - Well, that's good, isn't it?<br> - For her.<br> So what does it mean?<br> You know what I think?<br> Out there are all the answers.<br> No, Ed.<br> Out there...<br> ...are cows, and plenty of'em.<br> We're gonna go 200 miles<br> with a big, moving stink.<br> OK.<br> You guys are probably too young to<br> remember this, but when I was a kid...<br> ...I remember seeing<br> a movie called Red River.<br> - Oh, I've seen it on TV.<br> - But not in the movie theatre.<br> The big screen, with John Wayne<br> and Montgomery Clift.<br> Remember the scene,<br> the start of the cattle drive?<br> - Dad...<br> - No, no, son. That's why we're here.<br> - The "yee-ha" scene?<br> - The "yee-ha" scene.<br> Before they took the cattle out, those<br> cowboys waved their hats in the air...<br> ...and yelled "Yee-ha!"<br> - What do you say to that?<br> - All right! Move'em out.<br> - Yee-ha!<br> - Yee-ha!<br> - Ya-hoo!<br> - Ya-hoo!<br> Ya-hoo!<br> Yee-ha.<br> - Yee-haa!<br> - Yee-ha!<br> - Yee-ha!<br> - Yee-ha!<br> Yee-ha!<br> - Feel like a schmuck?<br> - Oh, yeah. A big schmuck.<br> Yee-haa!<br> We'll see you in Colorado.<br> / Fairy tales can come true<br> / It can happen to you<br> / If you're young at heart<br> / For it's hard, you will find<br> / To be narrow of mind<br> / If you're young at heart<br> / And if you should survive<br> / To 105<br> / Look at all you'll derive<br> / Just by being alive<br> / Now here is the best part<br> / You have a head start<br> / If you are amongst the very young<br> / At heart<br> Look, a stray.<br> You take him, Mitch.<br> - No, it's the first one. You get him, Ed.<br> - No, let Phil have him.<br> - No, you get this one.<br> - Are you sure? There's gonna be plenty.<br> You get this one. I'll get the next one.<br> Then Ed, then you...<br> Like a round robin?<br> That's good, yeah.<br> - So who gets this one?<br> - You.<br> - Come on. Go!<br> - Out of shoot No.9!<br> Hey, go Mitchy!<br> No, no.<br> Don't go back there. No!<br> Think I can't see you behind there?<br> Hello!<br> Come on, now.<br> Here we go.<br> Come on now.<br> Here we go. Come on.<br> It's like chasing a mime.<br> Yee-ha, cowboy!<br> - All right!<br> - All right, Mitchy!<br> I did it!<br> All right!<br> Uh-oh.<br> Hey, moonwalk.<br> I'd like to thank<br> everybody for helping me get my stray in.<br> All right, all right.<br> Come on back.<br> All right, now, easy on the clutch.<br> Cut the wheel! Cut it, cut it.<br> That's it. Straight back and park<br> and lock it. You got the keys, sir?<br> Whoo! I wish the kids coulda seen that.<br> Dump it into the personal,<br> then make out the cheque.<br> - He should know. He's our accountant.<br> - You're our accountant.<br> - Don't... Just get a Mets score.<br> - Arnold, I'm losing you.<br> We're going behind a butte.<br> Arnold?<br> Arnold, what's the Mets score?<br> The Mets... I lost him.<br> Boy, that saddle's having all the fun.<br> You have, like, a half-track mind.<br> - You wouldn't screw her brains out?<br> - Lovely image.<br> It ranks up there with my other favourite<br> of yours: "Bang the shit out of her."<br> I'm sorry if I offended<br> your delicate sensibilities.<br> - You were staring at her pretty good.<br> - That's different.<br> - Different?<br> - Yeah.<br> Look. I go to an art gallery,<br> right? And I see a Picasso.<br> - Oh, she's a Picasso now?<br> - No, she's not a Picasso.<br> If she was, she'd have three tits.<br> What I'm saying is if I see a nice painting,<br> I look at it, but I don't pull it off the wall.<br> Let me ask you this.<br> What if you could have great sex<br> with someone attractive...<br> ...and Barbara would never find out?<br> It's a big trap. I mean,<br> look what happened to Phil.<br> The girl came to his house,<br> then she came to my house.<br> Yeah.<br> - Let's say a spaceship lands.<br> - Good, reality. Are you listening to this?<br> A spaceship lands and the most beautiful<br> woman you ever saw gets out.<br> All she wants to do is have<br> the greatest sex in the universe with you.<br> - Could happen.<br> - When it's over, she flies away for ever.<br> No one will ever know.<br> You're telling me you wouldn't do it?<br> No. It just what you describing actually happened<br> to my cousin Ronald. And his wife did find out about<br> - They know everything there.<br> - Forget about it.<br> I'm saying it wouldn't make<br> it all right if Barbara didn't know.<br> I'd know, and I wouldn't<br> like myself. That's all.<br> - Pay attention, girls. We got strays.<br> - Hi, Curly. Kill anyone today?<br> Day ain't over yet.<br> I wonder what Barbara's doing.<br> You're really with just<br> one woman for 15 years? Just one?<br> Yes, Ed. I'm married. I caught my limit.<br> Why are you after me about this?<br> Let's say... all your life, for breakfast,<br> you eat from the Kellogg's variety pack.<br> - And a spaceship lands.<br> - No. Then you don't get the variety pack.<br> You pick one, your favourite one,<br> and you just get that one from then on.<br> Every day for the rest of your life,<br> the same cereal.<br> Then you wake up one morning...<br> and you're just not hungry any more.<br> You can't get an erection.<br> Hey, pal. I can get an erection<br> any time I want. Watch.<br> Ed, please don't. Leave the stallion in the<br> corral. You'll knock me into the fire, OK?<br> See, here's the thing.<br> - Kim wants to have kids.<br> - And you don't?<br> I say it's because<br> we wouldn't have as much fun.<br> But that's not the reason.<br> Having a kid, that's heavy.<br> That's a real commitment.<br> That's saying I'm never gonna be with<br> another woman for the rest of my life.<br> Wait a minute, let me get this straight.<br> I have no life.<br> We're all agreed on that, right?<br> - Right.<br> - OK.<br> Your big problem<br> is that you're married...<br> ...to this gorgeous<br> ...who thinks the sun rises and sets in your<br> pants, and that's not enough for you?<br> - You don't understand.<br> - No, I don't understand.<br> - I don't wanna screw around on Kim.<br> - So don't.<br> Oh.<br> From the king of restraint.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - It means that's pretty smug advice...<br> ...from a man who mounted an 18-year-old<br> checkout girl on the day-old bread rack.<br> - She's 20, and shut up.<br> - Let me get you hot, Phil.<br> - "I need a price, register nine."<br> - Cut it out.<br> What'd you use for protection?<br> Paper or plastic?<br> - Come on!<br> - We're on vacation!<br> - You're spookin' the cattle.<br> - We were just fooling around.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> Sunup.<br> - Morning.<br> - Hi.<br> - You done with that?<br> - Yeah, help yourself.<br> See, Mom, we're keeping clean.<br> It's cold... but I'm a real pioneer man.<br> - Morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> Come on, guys.<br> You're sorry, you're sorry.<br> Let's make up, huh?<br> All right.<br> - My fault.<br> - No, it's all right.<br> Gotta celebrate. I got a special treat.<br> I'm gonna make fresh coffee.<br> Battery-operated. Instantly grinds<br> its own beans. Only 19.95.<br> - Come on, why live like animals?<br> - That's great.<br> First cup's for my good friend Phil.<br> When we were kids, he used to<br> let me watch his sister undress.<br> I never forgot it, Phil...<br> cos I still do it. OK.<br> Wow.<br> Something's spookin' the cattle.<br> Look, look.<br> The cows are going away.<br> - Wow, look at'em go.<br> - That is amazing.<br> - Stampede!<br> - We gotta get'em.<br> Whoa!<br> - Beautiful. Get that in the frame.<br> - I got it.<br> I'm gonna die.<br> I'm gonna die. Oh, God.<br> They're comin' at us!<br> - Come on!<br> - Hold on, hold on, hold on.<br> Bonnie, there's a stampede...<br> ...in your tent.<br> City folk.<br> I'm sorry. I mean, I was just tryin'<br> to make a cup of coffee. That's all.<br> It was... it was French roast.<br> There's still a few head missin'.<br> Must have gone into that canyon.<br> - TR and I'll get'em.<br> - No, I'll get'em...<br> ...with you.<br> - Me?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You're comin' with me.<br> - Just the two of us?<br> You move the herd.<br> I'll catch up.<br> - You mean, we'll catch up.<br> - Let's go.<br> Bye.<br> Curly, did I ever show you pictures of<br> my wife and kids? I'm their sole support.<br> - Is he gonna be all right?<br> - Sure.<br> Curly's just trying to scare him.<br> You know Mitch. He's a wise ass.<br> If anything happens to him...<br> ...I'm going after Barbara.<br> Throw a rope on this'un so we<br> can go after the others. Rope him.<br> I'm not good at it.<br> I have a roping disability.<br> - Be right with you.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> Hey.<br> See, I'm good at this part.<br> Throw it.<br> You know what just occurred to me?<br> Roping is stupid.<br> This is a cow, not a gazelle.<br> Watch. Get off the horse, huh?<br> Then you walk up to the cow.<br> Look how good this is working.<br> Then you say "Hi, Bob Vila for This<br> Old Herd. We're gonna rope you today."<br> Then you take Mr Loop<br> and put it around the head of Mr Cow.<br> - What's wrong with that?<br> - That!<br> - I'm on vacation!<br> - Is that it?<br> - That's it.<br> - What are we doing?<br> - Making camp.<br> Too late to catch up with the herd<br> before dark. We'll catch up tomorrow.<br> You mean we're gonna<br> sleep out here? Just...<br> That's right.<br> Oh, God.<br> It's Deliverance.<br> Getting ready to shave?<br> You make a lot of... smart remarks<br> at my expense, don't you?<br> I'm joking.<br> I do with everybody.<br> It's just my way.<br> I don't understand that way.<br> Put that away.<br> I said... put that away.<br> You know, the first time I tried<br> to talk to you, you embarrassed me.<br> So I teased you a little bit, which maybe<br> I shouldn't have done. So I'm sorry.<br> Now you're playing with your knife,<br> trying to frighten me...<br> ...which you're doing a good job...<br> But if you're gonna kill me...<br> get on with it.<br> If not, shut the hell up.<br> I'm on vacation.<br> / See them tumbling down<br> / Pledging their love to the ground<br> / Lonely but free I'll be found<br> / Driftin' along<br> /with the tumblin' tumbleweeds<br> / Cares of the past are behind<br> / Nowhere to go but I'll find<br> / Just where the trail will wind<br> / Drifting along<br> /with the tumblin' tumbleweeds<br> Do you know any show tunes?<br> The second it's over,<br> she'll get back into her spaceship...<br> ...and fly away for eternity.<br> - Would you do it?<br> - Is she a redhead?<br> Could be.<br> I like redheads.<br> - You ever been married?<br> - No.<br> You ever been in love?<br> Once...<br> I was drivin' a herd across the Panhandle.<br> - Texas.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> Passed near this little dirt farm<br> round about sundown.<br> Out in the field was this young woman...<br> ...working down in the dirt.<br> Just about then,<br> she stood up to stretch her back.<br> She was wearing a little cotton dress,<br> and the settin' sun was right behind her...<br> ...showing the shape<br> that God had give her.<br> What happened?<br> I just turned around and rode away.<br> Why?<br> I figured it wasn't gonna get<br> any better than that.<br> Yeah, but you could've been,<br> you know... with her.<br> I been with lots of women.<br> Yeah, but, you know, she could've<br> been the love of your life.<br> She is.<br> That's great.<br> That's... not great.<br> No, that's wrong. You passed up<br> something that might have been terrific.<br> - My choice.<br> - I never could have done that.<br> That's your choice.<br> A cowboy leads a different kind of life.<br> When there were cowboys.<br> We're a dyin' breed.<br> Still means somethin' to me, though.<br> In a couple of days,<br> we'll move this herd across the river...<br> ...drive'em through the valley.<br> There's nothin' like bringin' in a herd.<br> See, now that's great.<br> Your life makes sense to you.<br> - What's so funny?<br> - You city folk worry about a lot of shit.<br> Shit? My wife basically told me<br> she doesn't want me around.<br> Is she a redhead?<br> - I'm just saying...<br> - How old are you?<br> - 38.<br> - 39.<br> Y'all come up here about<br> the same age. Same problems.<br> Spend about 50 weeks a year<br> gettin' knots in your rope.<br> Then you think two weeks<br> up here'll untie'em for you.<br> None of you get it.<br> - Do you know what the secret of life is?<br> - No. What?<br> - This.<br> - Your finger?<br> One thing.<br> Just one thing.<br> You stick to that and<br> everything else don't mean shit.<br> That's great,<br> but... what's the one thing?<br> That's what you gotta figure out.<br> Oh, damn it.<br> Come on!<br> - What's goin' on?<br> - This cow's having a baby.<br> I noticed it when we found her.<br> I was hopin' she'd make it<br> through the drive, but... she's ready.<br> Does she do it herself?<br> Or do you help her?<br> I'll hold her down.<br> You deliver the calf.<br> Excuse me? Hello?<br> Why don't I hold her down?<br> You don't know how. She'll kick you<br> and kill you, and her and the calf.<br> - That's too much for me to carry back.<br> - I see your point.<br> Come on.<br> She's ready.<br> - I...<br> - She's burstin'!<br> Oh, God.<br> There's gonna be bursting?<br> Just reach in and pull out the calf.<br> Ooh.<br> - You know, this was not in the brochure.<br> - She needs help, goddamn it!<br> What's taking so long?<br> Do you see the head?<br> Ugh.<br> - I only see a tail.<br> - Oh, shit.<br> It's turned the wrong way.<br> Get it out.<br> Uh-oh.<br> - My watch came off.<br> - Now!<br> - It was a gift!<br> - Do it!<br> Come on.<br> - Oh, Jesus.<br> - Look what I did!

He gets that<br> from my side of the family.<br> We all walk very early.<br> I'm gonna name him Norman.<br> You know, cos years ago...<br> - Why did you do that?<br> - She was dying.<br> And she was suffering.<br> We saved the calf.<br> Good job, cowboy.<br> There you go, Norman.<br> You are only down a quart.<br> That's really wonderful.<br> You got him to drink from the bottle.<br> Yeah, thank God,<br> cos my nipples were killing me.<br> What do you think? What would be<br> the perfect flavour with this meal?<br> - Cherry vanilla?<br> - No.<br> If it was Chinese food, right on<br> the money, but this... toasted almonds.<br> What's goin' on?<br> Barry can pick out the right flavour<br> of ice cream to follow any meal.<br> Go ahead.<br> Challenge him.<br> - "Challenge him"?<br> - Come on.<br> Franks and beans.<br> Scoop of chocolate, scoop of vanilla.<br> Don't waste my time.<br> Come on.<br> Push me.<br> - Sea bass.<br> - Grilled?<br> - Sauteed.<br> - I'm with ya.<br> Potatoes au gratin.<br> Asparagus.<br> Rum raisin.<br> Woof!<br> Woof what?<br> How do you know he's right?<br> How do we know? 1400 retail outlets<br> across the country. That's how we know.<br> Woof!<br> Will you stop<br> with Roberto Clemente?<br> Henry Aaron was the greatest<br> right fielder of our generation.<br> - Could he run like Clemente?<br> - I'm gonna say one thing to you.<br> Goodbye.<br> Clemente was killed in a plane crash.<br> - You're gonna blame that on Aaron?<br> - No. I'm just saying.<br> - Oh, baseball.<br> - You got something against baseball?<br> I used to live with a guy who was like a<br> baseball encyclopaedia. I just got flashes.<br> - You broke up with him cos of baseball?<br> - Uh, no.<br> We had different needs. I needed him<br> to treat me decently and get a job.<br> He needed to empty<br> my bank account and leave.<br> Ouch.<br> - So do you hate baseball?<br> - No, I like baseball.<br> I just never understood how you guys<br> can spend so much time discussing it.<br> I've been to games,<br> but I don't memorise...<br> ...who played third base<br> for Pittsburgh in 1960.<br> Don Hoak.<br> - Beat you.<br> - See, that's exactly what I mean.<br> So what do you and your friends<br> talk about out there?<br> Well... real life.<br> Relationships.<br> Are they working, are they not?<br> Who's she seeing.<br> Is that working?<br> - No contest. We win.<br> - Why?<br> Honey, if that were<br> as interesting as baseball...<br> ...they'd have cards for it<br> and sell it with gum.<br> Ed, I see by the sun<br> it's time for you to hibernate again.<br> You're right, I suppose.<br> I guess it is childish...<br> ...but when I was about 18...<br> ...and my dad and I couldn't<br> communicate about anything at all...<br> ...we could still talk about baseball.<br> Now that was real.<br> You know what the secret of life is?<br> It's this.<br> One thing.<br> Just one thing.<br> - And what's that?<br> - I have no idea.<br> But ask Curly cos he seems to know.<br> - Curly knows the secret of life?<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm gonna invite him over.<br> He's a very interesting guy.<br> I'm sure he is.<br> Hey, Curly.<br> Curly?<br> Curl, you got a minute?<br> He is a real cowboy. He sleeps with his<br> eyes open so he can still watch the herd.<br> Curl.<br> Curly?<br> Is this all right? Do you need, like, a<br> licence or something to bury somebody?<br> Nah. This is where<br> Curly'd wanna be buried.<br> He said he was a dying breed.<br> I didn't know he meant on this trip.<br> The man ate bacon at every meal.<br> I mean, you can't do that.<br> Well, I guess that's it.<br> Wait a minute. Shouldn't somebody<br> say something? Like a eulogy.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Cookie, you knew him best.<br> Lord, we give you Curly.<br> Try not to piss him off.<br> That's it?<br> What else is there?<br> I got chicken burning.<br> You're a warm man, Cookie.<br> Wait a second. I'll...<br> What can I say about Curly?<br> I didn't know you well,<br> but I'll never forget you.<br> You lived life on your terms -<br> simple, honest and brave.<br> I'm glad for this short time<br> that we spent together.<br> Amen.<br> Amen.<br> Do you think this is all right?<br> With them?<br> All right, listen up. Ben, I want you<br> to take the left flank with TR and Bonnie.<br> I want you three boys to ride point.<br> I'm gonna push with Steve, Barry and Ira.<br> Yeah, they're pros.<br> It'll be OK.<br> So long, cowboy.<br> - You know, it makes you stop and think.<br> - Stop the clock.<br> - That's 25 minutes. I win.<br> - Win what?<br> I had under a half an hour<br> before you started to talk about death.<br> Why would you think<br> I would talk about death?<br> We just came from a funeral.<br> And it's your favourite subject.<br> It is not. I think<br> when you see a life end...<br> ...it's a natural time to think<br> about your own mortality.<br> No, it isn't.<br> Why do that to yourself?<br> When somebody dies,<br> I don't change places with him.<br> I appreciate the fact that I'm not dead.<br> Look at this. It's a beautiful day.<br> I'm here with my best friends.<br> We're driving a herd of cattle<br> across the plains.<br> Pretty goddamn great.<br> It's one of the best days of my life.<br> All right. What is the best day of your life?<br> - You mean ever?<br> - Yeah. Best day ever in your whole life.<br> And you can't do when your kids<br> were born. That's too easy.<br> I got one.<br> I'm seven years old and my dad<br> takes me to Yankee Stadium.<br> My first game.<br> We're going in this long,<br> dark tunnel underneath the stands.<br> I'm holding his hand and we come up<br> out of the tunnel into the light.<br> It was huge. How green<br> the grass was. Brown the dirt.<br> And that great green<br> copper roof. Remember?<br> We had a black-and-white TV, so this<br> was the first game I ever saw in colour.<br> I sat there the whole game<br> next to my Dad.<br> He taught me how to keep score.<br> Mickey hit one out.<br> - Good day.<br> - I still have the programme.<br> All right, what was<br> the worst day you ever had?<br> Worst day. A couple of years ago,<br> Barbara finds a lump.<br> - What?<br> - Jesus.<br> - It scared the shit out of me.<br> - You never said anything.<br> Yeah, well, it turned out to be<br> nothing. But that whole day was...<br> - Yeah, but that was a good day.<br> - How?<br> - Because it turned out to be nothing.<br> - Yeah, but the day until then was horrible.<br> Yeah, but it came out good.<br> You're a real "the glass is half-empty"<br> kind of a guy, you know that?<br> I don't know how Barbara can stand it.<br> Yeah.<br> All right. I got one.<br> My best day.<br> The one about Arlene<br> and that loose step?<br> No.<br> No, my wedding day.<br> - What?<br> - Yeah. Remember that day?<br> Outdoor wedding. Arlene looked great.<br> Those water pills really worked.<br> You guys are all smiling at me.<br> And my dad, in the front...<br> ...gives me a little wink... you know?<br> I mean, he's not the warmest<br> of men... but he winked.<br> I was the first to get married<br> and have a real job.<br> I remember thinking "I'm grown-up."<br> You know? "I'm not a goofball<br> any more. I made it."<br> I felt like a man.<br> It's the best day of my life.<br> - What was your worst day?<br> - Every day since is a tie.<br> All right, Ed. Your best day.<br> What is it, twins in a trapeze?<br> - No, I don't wanna play.<br> - We did it.<br> I don't feel like it.<br> OK.<br> I'm 14 and my mother and<br> father are fighting again.<br> You know, because she caught<br> him again. Caught him!<br> This time, the girl drove<br> by the house to pick him up.<br> I finally realised he wasn't just cheating<br> on my mother. He was cheating on us.<br> So I told him. I said "You're bad<br> to us. We don't love you."<br> "I'll take care of my mother and my sister.<br> We don't need you any more."<br> He made like he was gonna<br> hit me, but I didn't budge.<br> Then he turned around and he left.<br> Never bothered us again.<br> But I took care of my mother<br> and my sister from that day on.<br> That's my best day.<br> What was your worst day?<br> Same day.<br> He gets the sign from Berra...<br> He gets the sign from Berra.<br> The pitch.<br> Whoa!<br> / Rollin', rollin', rollin"<br> / Keep them dogies rollin"<br> / Man, my ass is swollen<br> / Rawhide!<br> / Get'em up, move'em out,<br> /wake'em up, get'em dressed<br> / Get'em shaved,<br> /comb their hair, rawhide<br> / Tie me down, tell me lies,<br> /pull my hair, smack my thighs<br> / With a big wet strap of rawhide<br> What is he doing?<br> Whoa, boy!<br> - He's drunk, the old shithead.<br> - Where'd he get the liquor?<br> - How do I know that?<br> - Goddamn, we better get him outta there.<br> - Is that a happy face?<br> He's nuts.<br> - He's throwing our food.<br> - Well, we'll...<br> We'll what?<br> We'll order out?!<br> - He's headed for the ravine.<br> - I'm sure he sees it.<br> - Jump!<br> What can you say about<br> Skyrocket and Buttercup?<br> - Let's just get out of here.<br> - Let's recap on what we've buried so far.<br> - Trail boss, two horses...<br> - I can't believe we buried horses.<br> The impact drove'em into the ground.<br> We just covered'em up with some dirt.<br> - How do we move the food and the tents?<br> - Tents roll up.<br> We can pack enough food in<br> our saddlebags to get us there.<br> OK.<br> Let's do it.<br> The problem is Cookie.<br> Let's no forget his legs are broken.<br> Oh, God, they're gonna shoot him.<br> We put Cookie on this litter<br> so we can get him out of here.<br> Me and TR are gonna stay<br> with you all and the herd.<br> We're gonna be hittin'<br> some pretty rough mountain country.<br> There's a town, it's about half a day's<br> ride outta here. I can draw a map.<br> Somebody's gotta take<br> Cookie. Volunteers?<br> - I guess Steve and I should go.<br> - Why?<br> He's injured and<br> we have medical training.<br> We're dentists!<br> Are we gonna give him a cleaning?<br> We have a better chance<br> of helping than anyone, son.<br> - But you're having fun.<br> - Ride with me.<br> It will still be fun.<br> Huh?<br> - That's really great of you, Ben, Steve.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - Thanks, Ben.<br> - Good luck.<br> - Thank you, Dr Jessup.<br> - We would have gone, but...<br> Good.<br> I'll make up that map.<br> Hey, look. I found where<br> Cookie was hiding his whisky.<br> - You old coot.<br> - Hey, Jeff.<br> - Shouldn't we do something?<br> - Let'em have fun, then they'll sleep it off.<br> I knew we couldn't trust these guys.<br> I said "Tennis camp."<br> You said "Let's drive cattle."<br> Wait a minute.<br> I got an idea.<br> - Look at this.<br> - Norman.<br> - Norman.<br> - What are they doing with Norman?<br> Mitchy!<br> Mitchy, come on out and play.<br> - Don't go out there.<br> - What do you think, I'm nuts?<br> Mitch, do you like calf brains?<br> - This is over a cow.<br> - Here's your last chance.<br> - They won't hurt me. There's witnesses.<br> - Please be careful.<br> They're just gonna<br> embarrass me, so I'll let'em.<br> Norman, have you been<br> bothering the cowboys again?<br> You raise them, you try<br> to teach them right from wrong...<br> ...but they learn these things from<br> their friends. It's the school systems.<br> You're grounded, mister.<br> These cows today, huh?<br> You pansy-assed bastard.<br> - Are you talking to me or Norman?<br> - You shit-nosed little faggot.<br> Who, me?<br> Listen, guys. We have a group of people<br> here who came out for a good time...<br> ...and to say the least,<br> it's been a little bit strange.<br> But we're counting on you<br> to get us through this.<br> So I'm asking you, please, why don't<br> you just go and sleep it off, huh?<br> Sleep this off.<br> Yee-ha!<br> Put the gun down!<br> Put down the goddamn gun!<br> - Phil.<br> - I'm not gonna let him bully us any more.<br> - My father-in-law's a bully<br> - Phil.<br> I hate bullies!<br> Cos a bully doesn't just beat you up.<br> - He takes away your dignity.<br> - Phil!<br> I hate that.<br> I really... hate that.<br> Sorry.<br> Bang!<br> All right, you two assholes, go sleep it off.<br> And let's have some peace and quiet<br> around here for Christ's sakes!<br> I'm tired.<br> I've been under a lot of stress.<br> I lost my wife.<br> I lost my job.<br> And I've got some sort of rash...<br> from making in the bushes.<br> - Are you OK?<br> - Yeah.<br> Phil, thanks.<br> That was amazing.<br> - What?<br> - You know, uh...<br> Oh, that.<br> Yeah.<br> Why don't you put the gun down, Phil?<br> Oh, you don't have to worry.<br> I know how to handle a gun.<br> I used to keep one at the store.<br> You lock up late at night,<br> there's a lot of cash around.<br> You gotta make sure that<br> the register totals match the cash...<br> ...and cheques and the coupons.<br> You got the order forms<br> to fill out for the next day.<br> You gotta check the stock.<br> I mean, there's a lot to do there.<br> It's a very responsible job.<br> Oh, Christ.<br> Oh, Phil.<br> Come on, Philly.<br> Come on, man.<br> It's not that bad.<br> I'm at a dead end. I'm almost<br> Yeah, but now you got<br> a chance to start over. You know?<br> Phil, remember when we were kids?<br> And we'd be playing ball and<br> the ball would get stuck up in a tree?<br> - And we'd yell "Do over!" Huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> Your life is a "do over".<br> You got a clean slate.<br> I got no place to live.<br> I'm gonna get wiped out in the divorce<br> cos I committed adultery.<br> So I may never even see my kids again.<br> I'm alone.<br> How's that slate look now?<br> Well, the fun continues.<br> - They're gone.<br> - Who?<br> Jeff and TR.<br> They skedaddled.<br> They jumped on their horses and took off.<br> They probably thought<br> we'd get'em in trouble.<br> Does anybody know<br> how to get where we're going?<br> - So we're talking death?<br> - Won't Ben and Steve send some help?<br> Maybe they won't. When they left,<br> we were still pretty much OK.<br> - Still, they might.<br> - "Might"?<br> We're hanging our lives on "might"?<br> Let's not get hysterical, OK?<br> Calm down.<br> Now, for four days,<br> we've been going in this direction.<br> - I think we keep going in that direction.<br> - Isn't that a little vague?<br> Curly said there was a river and a valley.<br> We'll just have to do the best we can.<br> So you're saying we can drive this herd?<br> Herd?<br> Are you delirious?<br> We leave the herd.<br> We'll go ten times as fast without them.<br> But there's no pasture land up here.<br> There's no water.<br> I don't think they can survive up here.<br> Not to sound cold-hearted,<br> but so-the-hell-what?<br> They give us a trail boss with<br> a coronary and a bunch of drunks...<br> ...and we're supposed<br> to worry about the cattle?<br> - You're a nicer person than I am.<br> - No, you're right.<br> The rest of you go ahead.<br> I'll drive the herd.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I think I can bring in the herd.<br> No, you can't.<br> What are you, crazy?<br> You couldn't even manage your stores.<br> You had to bring in your cousin.<br> Mitch, you were right about<br> all the weekend warrior shit.<br> The war games, the parachuting.<br> That was all bullshit.<br> But this is really happening.<br> No rules, no games.<br> Just "Can I do it?"<br> It is a game. It's your regular<br> game, Ed. Don't you see it?<br> "Am I better than my father"?<br> Well, you are, OK?<br> - Look, I need to do this.<br> - It's impossible.<br> I'll do it with you.<br> Phil. Phil, you have, like,<br> a day's worth of food and water left.<br> - We'll be all right.<br> - Maybe you won't.<br> Why don't you accept that you<br> don't know what we're going through?<br> I know exactly what you're going through.<br> You think bringing in this herd is gonna<br> repair all the broken pieces of your life come together?<br> Hey, you don't wanna do it,<br> don't do it. We wanna do it.<br> - I'm not doing it.<br> - Don't do it. I'm not asking you to do it.<br> You have been talking me into doing stuff<br> like this all my life, and I am not doing it!<br> What, are you deaf?<br> I'm not asking you to do it.<br> Great!<br> Come on, Phil.<br> It's crazy.<br> We'll ride out together tomorrow<br> morning... without the herd.<br> They can do whatever they want.<br> Come on.<br> We've got cattle to move.<br> Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm not listening to you.<br> Goddamn cattle drive.<br> - Just do your job.<br> - I'm not listening to you any more.<br> - Listen to the cows.<br> - Come on, you damn little dogies.<br> Hey, stop that!<br> Cut that out!<br> - What are you doing?<br> - They're not cooperating. It's just like bringin' up my kids.<br> - You take those. I'll take these.<br> - Hey, come back here.<br> Hey! Stop!<br> Stop it!<br> Stop!<br> Get back here!<br> Ah, the hell with you.<br> Who needs you, anyway?<br> What the he...?<br> How did I do that?<br> Hey, Mitch!<br> It's Mitch!<br> Mitchy the Kid!<br> Curly said there's nothing<br> like bringing in a herd.<br> Nice hat, partner.<br> Come on.<br> Hey, there's my little man.<br> Sorry I was late, but there was<br> so much traffic. Let's go. Ha!<br> Don't be ashamed.<br> I had the same problem.<br> Didn't you feel stupid?<br> I mean...<br> Didn't you feel... inadequate?<br> Yeah, for a while.<br> But then I overcame it.<br> Can I explain it you again?<br> Promise me you won't get upset.<br> OK.<br> It's not gonna do any good.<br> OK. If you wanna watch one show, but<br> record another show at the same time...<br> ...the TV does not have<br> to be on channel three.<br> - It does.<br> - It doesn't.<br> If you're watching what you're<br> recording, it has to be on three.<br> - The TV or the machine?<br> - The TV.<br> I can record something<br> I'm not watching?<br> Yes, that's the point.<br> You don't even need a TV to record.<br> - How would I see it?<br> - To see it, you need a TV.<br> Shut up. Just shut up.<br> He doesn't get it!<br> He'll never get it. It's been four hours.<br> The cows can tape something by now.<br> Forget about it, please!<br> - How do you do the clock?<br> - You're dead. You are dead!<br> Yah! Yah!<br> Yah!<br> Let's go. Come on, Norman.<br> Keep up.<br> Norman, stay with the class.<br> Come on, boy.<br> Aw, shit.<br> - What do we do now?<br> - Like I should know?<br> - Come on, let's keep the herd together.<br> - Yeah, let's go.<br> Let's go, Norman.

We're lost,<br> but we're making good time.<br> This is the way, guys.<br> I can feel it.<br> - Is there a way around?<br> - That could be a hundred miles.<br> - It could take days.<br> - Is this supposed to be here?<br> There's probably an easy place<br> to cross but we missed it.<br> - This could be the easy place!<br> - Oh, God.<br> We did the best we could. Let's just leave<br> the herd and get the hell outta here, huh?<br> No.<br> A cowboy doesn't leave his herd.<br> You are a sporting-goods salesman!<br> Not today.<br> Easy... OK.<br> I started this...<br> and I'm gonna finish it.<br> I'm gonna finish it.<br> It's fast, but it's not deep.<br> Come on, bring'em down.<br> Come on!<br> Let's go!<br> Oh, God.<br> Come on, move!<br> Move it!<br> Move it, now.<br> Come on.<br> Whoa!<br> Shit.<br> Come on, boys!
