                        Oh, the Queen!<br> Where's the Queen?<br> The Queen is gone!<br> Cleopatra!<br> Cleopatra's gone!<br> What on earth do you mean?<br> Pothinos.<br> Here is your new kingdom,<br> Cleopatra.<br> Here you can command the asps<br> and scorpions of the desert.<br> Maybe they will bow low<br> and whisper "Majesty."<br> If my hands were free, I'd<br> kill you. But I am more kind.<br> I leave you this mighty<br> schoolmaster. Set him free.<br> Apollodorus.<br> With his help, you might<br> reach Syria over there.<br> And the way to Egypt?<br> Is death.<br> Set foot in Alexandria again,<br> and I'll kill you.<br> I have heard that Caesar comes<br> to Alexandria, Prime Minister.<br> I'm returning to meet<br> with Caesar, Philosopher.<br> Goodbye, Cleopatra,<br> Queen of the Desert.<br> You'll find, to your sorrow,<br> I'm still Queen of Egypt.<br> Untie me.<br> You understand, my Queen, he<br> returns to meet with Caesar.<br> Is this a time to talk of Romans?<br> I've had no breakfast. I'm hungry.<br> So is Caesar hungry.<br> For Egypt.<br> You see how wise<br> your father was...<br> to make Rome the protector of you<br> and your brother, King Ptolemy?<br> They've got you out of the way<br> to deal with your brother alone.<br> They can handle him.<br> I'll get back to Alexandria.<br> Majesty, it's death.<br> It's certain death to go.<br> How old is this Caesar?<br> I am told you have arrived<br> at a conclusion, Caesar.<br> I have.<br> Is it your judgment to support<br> the cause of Ptolemy or his sister?<br> Your young King Ptolemy<br> has raised an army...<br> to crush his sister,<br> Queen Cleopatra.<br> It must be disbanded.<br> As the general of that army,<br> suppose I refuse?<br> Well, we'll go into that if you<br> do, but I don't think you will.<br> Good model. Build it.<br> By what authority do you<br> judge the destiny of Egypt?<br> I am here to see<br> that there is peace in Egypt.<br> With a Roman army<br> waiting at the border?<br> Excellence, would you not enter<br> into a treaty with the King...<br> if the Queen has disappeared? Has she?<br> Rumor says that<br> Cleopatra has fled to Syria.<br> She must have.<br> She's not here.<br> Maybe she was assisted in<br> her flight. Who can tell?<br> Who can tell?<br> Well, from what I hear of her,<br> small loss to Egypt.<br> In such a case,<br> your king would be sole ruler.<br> Under Roman guidance.<br> And you would pay to Rome<br> each year one million denarii.<br> One million denarii!<br> One million denarii!<br> And 10 shiploads of Egyptian<br> corn for the unemployed in Rome.<br> Ten ships of corn. Ten thousand<br> votes in Rome for Caesar.<br> A hundred thousand maybe.<br> Who can tell?<br> Well, I'm waiting.<br> Agreed.<br> Let him sign it.<br> A letter. Julius Caesar<br> to the Senate, Rome.<br> A rug of Persia. A gift for<br> Caesar from Nahigian the merchant.<br> We give nothing<br> to Romans here.<br> Did you say<br> for Caesar?<br> Pass on.<br> What do you think you own, the Earth? Yes.<br> And we have made a settlement with Egypt<br> whereby we support young Ptolemy as King.<br> Your seal, Excellence.<br> Against the sedition<br> of his sister, Cleopatra...<br> who, by all reports,<br> has fled to Syria.<br> A gift for Caesar,<br> fit even for his eyes.<br> Thanks.<br> Give him something.<br> The wax is ready<br> for your seal, Caesar.<br> The rug, Excellence.<br> Will you receive it?<br> What? Yes, yes,<br> put it down.<br> Excellence,<br> the wax is cooling.<br> Observe, Caesar.<br> A most unusual design.<br> What? Well!<br> Greetings to Caesar<br> from Egypt.<br> A very amusing joke.<br> Very good.<br> But I'm too busy.<br> Huh?<br> What's the matter?<br> Tell him, Pothinos.<br> Tell him what's the matter, if your<br> lying tongue can find the words.<br> I am Cleopatra.<br> Huh?<br> Yes, a good joke.<br> She is Cleopatra,<br> and I am Caesar.<br> Come on. I'll take her away. No, you won't.<br> Enough of this.<br> Caesar, you must listen.<br> He abducted me to the desert<br> and left me there to die.<br> But nothing could stop me<br> from greeting you.<br> Are you to be fooled by a...<br> No, I am not to be fooled.<br> It's dangerous<br> to lie to me, Pothinos.<br> But, Caesar, I thought it would<br> be best all around if she...<br> Then you did lie to me.<br> So you would match wits<br> with Caesar?<br> Oh, no.<br> All right,<br> run along now.<br> The seal, Caesar.<br> Not yet.<br> This quarrel with your brother<br> will be settled in Rome.<br> That's all. Withdraw.<br> Come, Majesty.<br> Enough.<br> Before I go,<br> one word more?<br> Well? Well?<br> It seems strange<br> to see you working.<br> I've always pictured you<br> either fighting or loving.<br> Well, I have had<br> some experience with fighting.<br> But none with loving,<br> I suppose.<br> Well, none with<br> pretty little queens.<br> Oh. That was nice.<br> And now, with your permission,<br> I'll go to work again.<br> The dispatches from Gaul.<br> What... Oh, run along.<br> If I leave you now,<br> I'll be killed.<br> Pothinos has sworn to kill me.<br> Pothinos has said that if I ever set<br> foot in Alexandria again, he'd kill me.<br> The map of Gaul.<br> Well!<br> He usually does those things,<br> you know.<br> Can't you see I'm busy?<br> India.<br> Of course.<br> Of course I know<br> you're very busy...<br> but I thought you might<br> like to talk about India.<br> What? What about India?<br> It's the treasure house of the<br> East. With enough gold to...<br> Oh, but you're much too busy. We'll talk<br> about it tomorrow. If I'm still alive.<br> What about India?<br> Well, the road to India<br> lies through Egypt.<br> And the Queen of Egypt,<br> allied with Caesar could...<br> Why didn't you say that<br> right away?<br> My tongue was bewitched<br> by Caesar.<br> The man in you seems even<br> mightier than the general.<br> Egypt.<br> Sit down.<br> Pretty girl. Charming.<br> Now.<br> Now, what do you know<br> of India?<br> Oh, nothing much.<br> Ah.<br> But its gold would pay<br> Caesar's legions for a century.<br> Well! Now that's something<br> to talk about.<br> Yes, but not here.<br> Come to my chambers and dine.<br> We'll make such plans.<br> Are your plans<br> for India or me?<br> Both.<br> Shouldn't a queen choose<br> for her confidant a king?<br> The word "king"<br> is not well-liked in Rome.<br> Caesar takes<br> what he wants.<br> Flavius.<br> My own guard<br> for the Queen's safety.<br> I had to walk miles across<br> the desert to the sea...<br> to find the fishing boat<br> that brought me to you.<br> But just seeing you is magic,<br> immortal Caesar.<br> That's quite a speech.<br> Your tongue is no longer<br> bewitched by Caesar, eh?<br> No.<br> It's my heart now.<br> That's strange, too.<br> I've never loved before.<br> Love?<br> If you'd bring true the dreams of<br> empire that fill your pretty head...<br> leave love alone.<br> I can't. It's too late.<br> Ah.<br> It's too late.<br> Will you do something<br> that will make me very happy?<br> I am here<br> to make you very happy.<br> Then drive Pothinos<br> out of Egypt.<br> Drive him? Where?<br> Into the desert where he drove me. No.<br> I came to talk of India,<br> not the quarrels of Egypt.<br> But I am Egypt.<br> If I make you so.<br> I was wrong.<br> Let's not talk<br> at all tonight.<br> Perhaps there's nothing<br> to talk about, ever.<br> You don't trust me?<br> No.<br> And if I said I really love<br> you, you wouldn't believe me?<br> No.<br> And if I implored you<br> to marry me, you wouldn't?<br> I'd have to ask my wife<br> in Rome.<br> As if you'd care<br> about that.<br> Divorce her. Together we<br> could conquer the world.<br> Nice of you<br> to include me.<br> I will be<br> Caesar's wife and ally.<br> You rate yourself highly,<br> my child.<br> So a woman isn't strong enough<br> to help the mighty Caesar?<br> Caesar.<br> Have you ever thought<br> what your life is worth?<br> Well, it's worth<br> a great deal to me.<br> It must be worth a great<br> deal to others. Mine is.<br> And I'm only<br> the Queen of Egypt...<br> while Caesar, if he lives,<br> will be Emperor of the world.<br> If he lives?<br> Life is a precious thing,<br> isn't it?<br> I think so.<br> Hadn't you better<br> put that javelin down?<br> And if a man swears<br> to take the life of another...<br> death is justice for him.<br> I think so.<br> Pothinos.<br> He came to kill you.<br> Or you.<br> Passage to the tombs. I saw<br> his sandal beneath the curtain.<br> And now am I<br> worth talking to?<br> More...<br> Well, far more than Pothinos.<br> Guards!<br> Take it away.<br> Let's not talk anymore.<br> I picked a flower in Britain<br> once, the color of your eyes.<br> This is the first morning he's<br> been late since the day he was born.<br> Ho, there! Caesar comes!<br> Well, well, come on, come on.<br> Let's go to work.<br> Hold that letter<br> to the Senate.<br> But the agreement with<br> the King's Prime Minister.<br> Destroy it.<br> Even I can't reach<br> an agreement with a corpse.<br> The Prime Minister<br> is dead.<br> Then we deal<br> with the King?<br> The Queen. Cleopatra<br> is sole ruler of Egypt.<br> And I find that I shall<br> be here longer than I thought.<br> But the galley, Caesar,<br> is ordered to sail.<br> When I say so.<br> A letter to Marc Antony, Rome.<br> Here, you're with me.<br> Nobody ever hears from him.<br> Except Marc Antony. He gets<br> a letter every week or so.<br> Is it true that Caesar is<br> really in love... Child, child.<br> But he doesn't come back<br> to Rome, does he?<br> Well, he's missing<br> a lovely party today.<br> He doesn't miss<br> very much any day.<br> The Queen of Egypt<br> gives parties, too.<br> You mean Cleopatra?<br> Whoa! What? Have you heard<br> of Cleopatra?<br> Of course. All kinds<br> of things. Is she black?<br> Calpurnia.<br> My lady.<br> How beautiful you are. Is there<br> anything I can get for you?<br> Yes, a little luck.<br> The loveliest party<br> you've ever given, Calpurnia.<br> Thank you, Flora.<br> Wonderful.<br> The wife is always<br> the last one to know.<br> So is the husband,<br> when it comes to that.<br> They say he's planning<br> to move the capital to Egypt.<br> We were talking<br> of the games.<br> Have you seen<br> the new circus, Calpurnia?<br> I haven't been to the games<br> since Caesar left.<br> You should enjoy life more, Calpurnia.<br> Even Caesar's wife should play.<br> Why not?<br> She's above suspicion.<br> We waited two hours for you<br> yesterday. What kept you?<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I'll explain it later.<br> When is Caesar coming back?<br> Ever?<br> Tullius, I'm so sorry to hear<br> about your brother's exile.<br> I shall ask a pardon for him<br> when Caesar returns.<br> I hope he grants it.<br> If Caesar returns.<br> If Caesar returns.<br> It's rumored all over Rome.<br> It's been known for days.<br> If what you say<br> is true, Cassius...<br> we're in<br> a desperate situation.<br> But I can't believe it.<br> It is true, Brutus.<br> I heard with my own ears.<br> Quiet, Casca.<br> Let Brutus speak.<br> The people love you,<br> Brutus.<br> They love Caesar.<br> But he would<br> make himself king.<br> And then, where are we?<br> If I had proof of that...<br> He plans to divorce Calpurnia<br> and marry a queen.<br> This Cleopatra.<br> And call himself<br> King of Rome. Of us.<br> Emperor of the world.<br> Was I not born as free as<br> Caesar? And you? And you?<br> Caesar.<br> He's everywhere.<br> Rome is a republic.<br> It wants no crown.<br> It will have no king.<br> Octavia. Hello, dear.<br> Hello, dear.<br> Hello, Octavian.<br> Oh, it's a delightful party.<br> Sit down with us a moment.<br> Where's Antony?<br> Does any wife ever know<br> where her husband is?<br> Calpurnia knows<br> where her husband is.<br> Sit down just for a minute.<br> You look tired.<br> Just for a minute.<br> No news at all<br> from Caesar, eh?<br> I don't expect any.<br> He's too busy, Octavian.<br> Well, he shouldn't be too busy<br> to write to me.<br> He writes to Marc Antony.<br> Why Antony and not me?<br> Why? Tell me why.<br> Wouldn't you think he'd know the last<br> people you write to are relatives?<br> But I'm more than Caesar's<br> nephew, I'm his heir.<br> You're my brother, and Marc's my<br> husband. I know you both pretty well.<br> And if I were Caesar, I would<br> certainly write to Marc Antony.<br> Ho, there! Marc Antony comes!<br> Oh, Marc Antony's here!<br> Wait, wait, wait. I have news.<br> News?<br> Another letter from Caesar?<br> More than a letter.<br> Caesar is entering Rome.<br> Caesar is entering Rome!<br> Marc Antony, please.<br> I must see you for one day.<br> No, no, not now.<br> I came to get Calpurnia.<br> Slave. Take them.<br> Did you all hear?<br> Yes.<br> Well, well,<br> and who is this pretty maid?<br> Hello, darling.<br> "Hello, darling"?<br> You'd think she had met me<br> before. Or is it my fame she seeks?<br> Oh, he hasn't been to bed. He always<br> talks like this when he hasn't...<br> Sleep. I'm above sleep,<br> my beloved wife.<br> I'm glad<br> you're above something.<br> Ah, in his usual gay mood.<br> But, come on. We must hurry.<br> You ready, Calpurnia?<br> I'm not going.<br> Sorry?<br> I shall wait<br> for my husband here.<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing.<br> Oh, yes, there is. There's<br> a great deal the matter.<br> And I'm in no hurry to watch<br> Caesar's triumphal entry into Rome.<br> Why, what's the matter<br> with you?<br> Do you take us all for fools?<br> Don't you think we know<br> what Caesar plans to do?<br> And what does Caesar<br> plan to do?<br> Well, go and listen to him<br> in the Senate tomorrow...<br> and you'll learn<br> what he plans to do.<br> We don't have to. It's no music<br> to our ears to hear him desert us.<br> He's drunk with Egypt,<br> and he's deserting us.<br> Antony!<br> Antony! No! Octavian, no!<br> Antony...<br> I know.<br> There he is! There he is!<br> Caesar! Hail!<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> I thought she gave money.<br> Her dress is all gold.<br> She's too gorgeous.<br> In the shape of a sphinx.<br> But she is beautiful.<br> She is.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Oh, but look<br> at all those chariots!<br> Caesar.<br> Beware the Ides of March.<br> One date is as good<br> as another for a funeral.<br> Beware.<br> You may go now.<br> We need nothing more.<br> Well, Brutus, was I<br> right about... Be careful.<br> Must we whisper<br> what all Rome growls?<br> Yes, I believe.<br> Now that I know he's divorcing<br> Calpurnia to marry her.<br> That might be<br> his private affair...<br> but tomorrow he'll force the Senate<br> to declare him Emperor and King.<br> And present Cleopatra to them as... Queen.<br> Our Queen, Brutus.<br> Our Queen.<br> No, Rome cannot be turned<br> into another Orient...<br> with golden thrones<br> for a king and queen.<br> But I suppose he'll sway<br> the Senate as he always has.<br> Oh, no, he won't.<br> We'll greet Caesar<br> before he greets the Senate...<br> and a little blood<br> will be spilled for Rome.<br> So today you go<br> before the Senate to...<br> Well, all I can say is I<br> think it's your first mistake.<br> All I can say is<br> I don't care what you think.<br> You always did care<br> what I thought.<br> You always agreed.<br> Ah.<br> I don't hate women<br> for nothing.<br> Enobarbus speaks.<br> And speaks well.<br> What's this?<br> Antony hates women, too?<br> Out of their place, I do.<br> They've no place amongst men.<br> They can't think, and they can't<br> fight. They're just playthings for us.<br> Most of them.<br> All of them.<br> A woman's a woman.<br> We speak freely to you<br> because we are your friends.<br> I know that.<br> You say that the whole idea of<br> this marriage to Cleopatra...<br> is to capture India and then the<br> world. Does that sound like you?<br> When did you ever<br> ask anyone's help?<br> Anything you wanted,<br> you took.<br> It'll be easier<br> to take it this way.<br> Well.<br> Easier.<br> A strange word from Caesar.<br> Women soften all men.<br> He sounds<br> like a lover talking.<br> An Egyptian lover.<br> That woman's making<br> an Egyptian out of you.<br> You bring Egyptian ships<br> and men back with you.<br> You change the calendar<br> of Rome to Egypt's.<br> But you cannot make an Egyptian<br> queen a ruler over Romans.<br> Words.<br> Look at the Roman eagle with<br> half the world in his claws...<br> tamed by a woman.<br> I'm leaving for the Senate.<br> But, Caesar, you...<br> Are you coming, Antony?<br> No, I'll take no part in it.<br> Any man who wants to make a<br> fool of himself over a woman...<br> can do so,<br> as far as I'm concerned.<br> I don't know what the young man<br> means, but he means it violently.<br> And I agree with him.<br> Then you'd better follow him.<br> Caesar! Caesar!<br> Oh, Caesar.<br> Oh, you haven't gone.<br> Don't go! Oh, don't go.<br> Don't go.<br> Calpurnia.<br> I've had a dream,<br> a terrible vision.<br> I saw a flaming star falling, and<br> it was you, your body dripping blood.<br> I saw your toga torn by daggers, wet<br> with blood, your blood, my husband.<br> Oh, please, please don't<br> leave this house today.<br> It's an evil omen.<br> I know it. I know it.<br> Calpurnia, my dear...<br> the world's affairs cannot be<br> stopped because you've had a dream.<br> Casca the Senator.<br> Caesar. Caesar,<br> the Senate waits for you.<br> No, no, no. You shall not<br> go. I'll keep you here.<br> Calpurnia has seen a day<br> of evil for me in her dreams.<br> Perhaps...<br> Shall I return and tell the Senate, which<br> waits to offer you the world's crown...<br> that they must wait until<br> Calpurnia's dreams are pleasanter?<br> I'll come. Oh, no, no, Caesar. I beg you.<br> Not for myself but for you.<br> Oh, please, please, Caesar.<br> Evil is on every side.<br> I know it. I know it.<br> For what I have done,<br> Calpurnia, pardon.<br> For what I am about to do,<br> courage.<br> No. No!<br> The swan's feather.<br> Iras, be careful.<br> I'm trying to keep my hand<br> from shaking...<br> but, Majesty,<br> I'm so excited.<br> Majesty. Majesty.<br> Royal robes<br> for the Empress of the world.<br> Up the stairs.<br> Before the Queen.<br> And, Majesty, wait until you see<br> them. They're beautiful, marvelous.<br> Take the lid off.<br> Beautiful!<br> The Roman Senate<br> will get a thrill today.<br> Choose, Majesty.<br> It's not the Senate I'm worried<br> about but their fat wives.<br> Here.<br> Do you know anything<br> about senators, Charmion?<br> Well, we only got here<br> yesterday, Majesty.<br> Caesar! My sandals.<br> Hail, Caesar! Caesar comes!<br> I only stopped<br> for a last salute.<br> Oh, no, wait just a minute. There's<br> something I want to tell you.<br> Too late, my love. And<br> get dressed. Get dressed.<br> I'll be ready.<br> But the Senate is waiting.<br> Let them wait. I want a<br> moment all alone. But...<br> No, put your arms around me.<br> Hold me close to you.<br> I'm frightened of something.<br> Frightened?<br> What's the matter?<br> I love you so much.<br> And that frightens you?<br> Nothing must happen to you,<br> my Caesar.<br> Nothing will.<br> I'll send for you<br> the moment my speech is done.<br> You must be ready.<br> Emperor!<br> Empress!<br> He passes here.<br> Tullius. Decimus.<br> Solinus.<br> Casca. You, there.<br> Brutus, beside the column.<br> Listen!<br> He must be just arriving.<br> How long will the speech take?<br> He's sending for me right after.<br> You'll be ready.<br> And how you'll look.<br> Do you think you might wear this<br> dress when you get married, too?<br> What?<br> I was just thinking of the<br> great Caesar trying to unhook it.<br> Charmion.<br> Listen.<br> Listen to the cheers now.<br> Hail! Hail, Caesar!<br> Hail, Caesar!<br> Caesar, hail!<br> Caesar, I warned you.<br> The Ides of March.<br> The Ides of March are here.<br> But not gone.<br> Caesar!<br> Caesar comes!<br> Ah, Caesar.<br> A pardon, Caesar, for my<br> brother in exile. Denied.<br> You tyrant!<br> Stand back!<br> Take your hands off me!<br> Let me get out of here!<br> Get off me!<br> You! You, too, Brutus!<br> A great day for Rome.<br> Am I all right?<br> Marvelous.<br> Beautiful. The senators' eyes<br> will pop right out of their heads.<br> Caesar is dead!<br> What?<br> Caesar is dead!<br> Caesar is a traitor to Rome!<br> His speech is over. It must<br> be. I hear the shouting.<br> Apollodorus,<br> has the messenger come?<br> Not yet.<br> I never saw anything<br> so beautiful.<br> Let me show you.<br> How do you like this?<br> Gorgeous.<br> Or do you like this?<br> I am only a man.<br> How can I tell?<br> The Queen! The Queen!<br> Where's the Queen?<br> Stand!<br> Stand!<br> Stop! Stop!<br> Caesar has been murdered!<br> Royal Egypt,<br> Caesar is dead.<br> How was this? By whom?<br> I don't know, but I heard<br> them cry, "Brutus! Cassius!"<br> As I galloped through the<br> streets, I heard them shout:<br> "Caesar is a traitor to Rome!"<br> Where is he? Where is Caesar?<br> Dead, Majesty.<br> The body lies at the foot<br> of Pompey's statue.<br> No one will touch it.<br> I will.<br> Majesty, you cannot.<br> No, my Queen. No.<br> Majesty! Majesty!<br> They come this way.<br> They cry for Egypt's blood!<br> Man the small boat<br> at the foot of the garden.<br> Come, my Queen.<br> Come. We must go. We must<br> escape. They will kill you.<br> Think of Egypt.<br> "Think of Egypt"?<br> Always Egypt!<br> But Caesar is dead.<br> My Emperor.<br> That dream is gone.<br> Gone.<br> Yes, gone.<br> What do I care for empire now?<br> Caesar is dead.<br> My lover is dead.<br> He didn't love you.<br> You lie! You lie! You lie!<br> Majesty.<br> It wasn't in his arms<br> he wanted to hold Egypt.<br> It was in his treasury.<br> It's true.<br> You were blind.<br> He didn't love you.<br> You were blind.<br> Blind.<br> Antony.<br> Always Antony.<br> Sit down, Octavian.<br> Sit down.<br> That's all I do, sit.<br> Well, then sit down.<br> I won't sit down!<br> See, he can't even sit down.<br> Antony, Octavian.<br> Caesar dead only two weeks, and you<br> fill his house with your quarrels.<br> The Senate has decreed that you<br> both shall rule Rome together...<br> and that Antony shall avenge the<br> death of Caesar upon the traitors...<br> and shall punish Egypt.<br> But why Antony? I'll govern<br> with you if I have to.<br> But if there's any fighting<br> to be done, I'll do it alone.<br> Alone. You want to do<br> everything alone.<br> You took advantage of Caesar<br> lying on his funeral pyre...<br> to gain the public's support<br> for yourself.<br> You used my uncle's dead body<br> to win control...<br> holding up his bloodstained<br> toga like any playactor...<br> to make the crowd cheer you.<br> You, with your,<br> "Friends, Romans, countrymen."<br> That's enough!<br> Steady.<br> I accept the Senate's order.<br> Good.<br> And you, Octavian?<br> Oh, I suppose so.<br> And how do you<br> propose to punish Egypt?<br> I shall write a letter<br> to the Egyptian Queen...<br> demanding that she meet me in<br> the public square in Tarsus.<br> A letter? The great Marc Antony<br> fights with friendly notes.<br> Really, Octavian, you must...<br> No, it's all right.<br> Octavian's right, for once.<br> It will be a friendly note.<br> Well, but I don't understand.<br> Friendly?<br> I see.<br> She will think the meeting<br> a friendly discussion...<br> on Roman and Egyptian affairs.<br> Yes.<br> Instead, my legions will be with me in<br> Tarsus on our way to take Egypt by force.<br> From Tarsus, I shall send<br> Cleopatra to Rome in chains.<br> That's more like<br> the real Marc Antony.<br> We're approaching Tarsus.<br> Are we?<br> And no plans yet, Cleopatra.<br> If you fail, it means slavery<br> for Egypt and death for you.<br> If you had listened to me, at least<br> we'd have ships and men with us.<br> Where do we meet Marc Antony?<br> In the public square<br> at noon.<br> Well, why doesn't she come?<br> How should I know?<br> Where are the two generals<br> you sent to bring her?<br> Waiting for her, I suppose, like<br> you and me and the whole Roman army.<br> Waiting for a woman. A woman!<br> Six hours. While you<br> stand here and do nothing.<br> Go and get her.<br> Well, it's about time.<br> What? Apologize!<br> I apologize.<br> Watch your tongue, or I'll<br> cut it out of you! Wait here.<br> I'll go down to her boat<br> and get her myself.<br> Stop there!<br> Who nears the Queen's barge?<br> I'm Antony of Rome.<br> You're late.<br> Where are my men?<br> Oh, Charmion.<br> Where are the Romans who<br> came here today? Do you know?<br> They're sleeping, my Queen.<br> Sleeping? What for?<br> They're... Well, I should<br> say they were a little tired.<br> You mean a little drunk!<br> No, awfully drunk.<br> Come and see.<br> Get someone<br> to fling them ashore.<br> We'll go now.<br> Get ready.<br> Were you speaking to me?<br> Who do you think?<br> I sent orders for you to come to the<br> square. I'm not used to being disobeyed.<br> And why should I obey you? Your letter<br> said we had things to talk about.<br> The letter said that we would meet<br> in the public square in Tarsus...<br> and that's where we're going.<br> Oh.<br> We can't talk here then?<br> No, we cannot talk here.<br> Talk? With all this?<br> Oh, how different<br> from your generals.<br> Well, I guess<br> I must confess everything.<br> I must tell you why I wanted to<br> meet you here instead of the square.<br> Well?<br> Do you see<br> the way I'm dressed?<br> What about it?<br> I'm dressed<br> to lure you, Antony.<br> You see all this? It was<br> all a plan. And you know why?<br> Because it was my only chance.<br> Don't you think I know you're my<br> enemy, you and your hungry Rome?<br> But I suppose it was the most<br> stupid thing I could have done.<br> Why, do you know I had show after<br> show with which to dazzle you?<br> But Antony is not a man to be<br> dazzled if he doesn't please. No.<br> What do you care for this,<br> for instance?<br> Watch.<br> I wish you could see your face. Huh?<br> I'd have more chance<br> with a stone wall.<br> Will you forgive me<br> for being such a fool?<br> I should have known that Antony<br> is not Antony for nothing.<br> Well, shall we go now?<br> Yes, we'll go. My wits have<br> failed, and I'm in your hands.<br> But what could I do?<br> No, what would you have done?<br> Pretend you're me and I'm you.<br> No, no. No, no. You're<br> Cleopatra and I'm Antony.<br> Do I look like that?<br> Well, do I?<br> I think you'd better<br> stay as Cleopatra.<br> Oh, no, no. Don't drink that. No,<br> that was part of the plan, too.<br> I was going to get you<br> so irresponsible.<br> You didn't think one goblet<br> would do it, did you?<br> Yes, wouldn't it?<br> Well, that does amuse me.<br> But it's such a large goblet.<br> Yes, isn't it?<br> Well.<br> Well.<br> I hope that you know that I<br> know you want me to do this.<br> Dear Antony, I hope you think<br> I know that you know I know.<br> Oh.<br> No, we're not<br> dining here after all.<br> No, wait.<br> What is it?<br> Reed birds from the Nile.<br> Are they any good?<br> Oh, they're supposed to be.<br> There's not very much to it,<br> is there? Then we may dine here?<br> I'm really very hungry.<br> So am I,<br> when it comes to that.<br> Your little reed birds<br> aren't enough for me.<br> No, wait, Antony.<br> Clams from the sea. They're<br> catching them now. Come and see.<br> Jewels.<br> You are a good fisherman.<br> The golden streams of Egypt<br> never run dry.<br> Throw them.<br> Roman dogs.<br> Yes, Egyptian cats.<br> Starlit night<br> Let enchantment bright<br> Weave a spell on him<br> Whom I love<br> Grant me the heart I crave<br> Hear the prayer<br> of thy slave<br> Isis<br> Great Queen<br> of Night and love<br> Hear thy slave<br> Hear thy slave<br> A song to the stars.<br> They must think<br> we're funny people...<br> scheming to destroy each other<br> as if we had forever to live.<br> They must wonder:<br> "Why don't Egypt and Rome<br> meet in the public square...<br> "to plan union<br> instead of conquest?"<br> Yes, it's very funny.<br> I said things to Caesar<br> I wish I hadn't.<br> Oh?<br> There's beauty in the Egyptian<br> Queen besides her face.<br> Do you miss him?<br> No, he didn't love me.<br> Is that really the reason?<br> No, not really. I admire<br> men who don't love women.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Women should be but toys for<br> the great. It becomes them both.<br> To you for that.<br> Oh.<br> And to you for that.<br> Why, Antony.<br> What?<br> Did I hear you hiccup?<br> Not me. I never hiccup.<br> Well, it certainly wasn't me.<br> Queens don't hiccup.<br> Well, I don't know whether they do<br> or not. They most certainly do not.<br> Queens only talk of stars.<br> Well, who do you suppose it can be?<br> Because I'm sure I heard something.<br> It's somebody under the couch. Ah.<br> Come out. Come out!<br> They're gaining.<br> I'm very much afraid it's the<br> Queen of Egypt who's hiccupping.<br> Oh, but doesn't that<br> seem a little absurd? Yes.<br> I'll stop them for you.<br> Don't you ever have<br> hiccups, Antony?<br> No, not tonight, I don't.<br> Does it hurt?<br> Oh, no, not a bit.<br> Well, it did it, didn't it?<br> Oh, yes, it did it.<br> What would happen<br> if you hit me like this?<br> I'd knock your head off.<br> And it would go rolling down<br> the deck into the river.<br> Wouldn't even touch the deck.<br> You're charming.<br> All right,<br> I'm ready to go now.<br> Why? Oh, you don't<br> find me charming.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I could fall in love with you,<br> but I don't intend to.<br> What for?<br> Do you mean that?<br> There's no one like you.<br> Octavian! Octavian!<br> Hail! Hail, Octavian!<br> Hail! Hail, Octavian!<br> Your cheers at last!<br> And they can only mean that<br> at last you agree with me...<br> that Marc Antony<br> is a traitor to Rome.<br> Antony's a traitor!<br> A traitor, I tell you!<br> Two months, two long months have<br> come and gone, and what has happened?<br> Nothing!<br> Not a thing!<br> Has he attacked Egypt<br> with his legions there?<br> No! No!<br> Has he brought<br> Cleopatra back in chains?<br> No!<br> No!<br> Has he done anything?<br> No. Nothing.<br> Yes, he's done one thing,<br> and that completely.<br> He's sailed to Egypt<br> with the Queen...<br> and lived there ever since<br> with no thought of Rome.<br> He's forgotten Rome.<br> Who is this poisonous snake<br> that wrecks our men?<br> Caesar first, and now Antony.<br> When will it end?<br> I'll tell you when!<br> Now!<br> Now!<br> This time it's my turn. There<br> will be no more talk of war.<br> There will be war!<br> War!<br> No more shining words,<br> but shining steel!<br> Rome will be paid<br> with Antony's blood...<br> and the Egyptian snake will be<br> destroyed, and there shall be war!<br> War! War! War! War!<br> What?<br> I never can believe it.<br> What? I should want to leave you right now.<br> Why should you?<br> For a little while, I should.<br> Why?<br> So that you won't tire of me.<br> Aren't you afraid<br> I might tire of you?<br> No.<br> I should want to go out and<br> get drunk with a lot of men.<br> Or find another woman.<br> Well, why don't you?<br> Because you are another woman.<br> New. Always new.<br> Completely new.<br> Majesty! Majesty!<br> Majesty!<br> What is it?<br> King Herod has arrived.<br> Had you forgotten?<br> No, no. Where is he?<br> He's waiting in the audience<br> chamber. I beg of you. Hurry, Majesty.<br> Come now, what's the hurry?<br> Oh, please.<br> What do you care<br> for the king of Judea?<br> But he's my guest. Oh, now, be a good<br> boy and stop frowning. I have to dress.<br> All right, but kiss me first.<br> Now run along.<br> Welcome.<br> I hope to renew an old<br> friendship. I hope so, too.<br> Well, time has made you<br> older and wiser.<br> And me younger<br> and more beautiful.<br> And any news?<br> News, indeed.<br> I come directly from Rome<br> on my way to Judea. Ah.<br> Yes, directly from Rome.<br> As a friend and ally of Rome?<br> And as a friend<br> and ally of Egypt.<br> And the news?<br> If you'll dismiss<br> your court, I...<br> Charmion.<br> Well?<br> For the moment, I'm tongue-tied<br> before so much beauty.<br> The news. The news.<br> You go to great length for<br> the sake of Egypt, don't you?<br> You know, I...<br> I wonder how far<br> you would go, really.<br> Octavian<br> doesn't like Antony...<br> but Octavian is in power now.<br> If Antony were dead...<br> Octavian would be a very<br> good friend and ally of Egypt.<br> He told me to give you<br> that message.<br> Oh.<br> I thought you were<br> a friend of Antony.<br> I am. I am.<br> I always said there was no man in the<br> world that could drink with Antony...<br> but not now.<br> But listen...<br> No, no, no.<br> My friend, when a man<br> is drunk with love...<br> he can't divide his<br> concentration with wine, you know.<br> All major emotions are greedy.<br> And tell me, my friend, aren't you<br> happier with her than with a grape?<br> Or anything else.<br> I'm mad about her.<br> Of course you are, my boy. Of<br> course. That reminds me of something.<br> Something very funny, too, that I<br> heard recently in Rome from Octavian.<br> Octavian?<br> It must have been funny.<br> It was, Antony. It was.<br> Listen, this is what he said.<br> If Cleopatra<br> would poison Antony...<br> Rome would forgive her for everything,<br> and that would be the salvation for Egypt.<br> Poison me?<br> Uh-huh. Poison you.<br> Just imagine,<br> Cleopatra poisoning you.<br> What did I say?<br> Isn't it funny?<br> It's the funniest thing<br> I've ever heard.<br> As if love didn't conquer<br> all. As if it didn't.<br> Poison me? I can't wait to<br> tell her! How she'll laugh.<br> I'll go and tell her.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Yes, do that, Antony.<br> Do tell her, please.<br> She...<br> You poison me!<br> You must for Egypt.<br> Egypt.<br> Now you ask me<br> to do murder for Egypt.<br> I can't. I can't.<br> It's only one life against<br> the freedom of your people.<br> You don't love him.<br> What's your crime?<br> Murder. I killed my wife<br> and child while I was drunk.<br> What punishment<br> has been decreed?<br> Crucifixion.<br> How long will it take you<br> to die on the cross?<br> I am strong, Majesty.<br> Two days. Maybe three.<br> Would you like to die<br> in three seconds?<br> Majesty, you're merciful.<br> Take this.<br> Drink it.<br> Was there any pain?<br> A little, a very little.<br> There must be no pain.<br> What's this?<br> The Queen is testing poisons.<br> A wine we've never had before,<br> dear Antony. I've been saving it.<br> What for?<br> For a night<br> when the mood strikes.<br> I see.<br> And tonight is that night?<br> Tonight.<br> Now, can you think<br> of a pretty toast?<br> It would please me very much.<br> You're very gay.<br> And you're very solemn.<br> Is there any reason?<br> I'm thinking.<br> Evidently.<br> Well, let's drink first.<br> Perhaps pretty words will follow.<br> But you don't drink.<br> Neither do you.<br> I don't wish to drink alone.<br> And I don't think<br> I wish to drink at all.<br> Well...<br> he is in a strange<br> mood tonight.<br> Now tell me,<br> what's the matter?<br> Oh. For some reason, I've...<br> I've no thirst tonight.<br> I'd far prefer just to sit<br> and watch you drink.<br> You really mean that?<br> Yes, I do.<br> If that's what you prefer, I<br> always try to please you, Antony.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> The strangest man<br> on the face of the earth.<br> The happiest man<br> on the face of the earth.<br> Come on. Let's drink.<br> Look, Antony.<br> What?<br> The reed birds again.<br> Not much of a meal for a man. These<br> things get smaller and smaller.<br> Do you remember the stars?<br> Yes, and the river.<br> And the rose. When I put it in<br> your hair, and you were Cleopatra.<br> Yes, and I threw it<br> back at you.<br> And I sweetened<br> your wine with it.<br> That was a night.<br> Let's drink to the river.<br> To the river.<br> Majesty.<br> What is it?<br> A carrier pigeon from Rome.<br> Rome has declared war.<br> War? Let me see that.<br> Octavian declares<br> me a traitor, eh?<br> Octavian!<br> Octavian to meet me!<br> I'm laughing now.<br> Go get Enobarbus.<br> Send him here.<br> I take orders only from my Queen. What?<br> Now, get up and get him!<br> You keep out of this!<br> Another word from you, and I'll<br> smash you to powder. Now, get him!<br> All Egyptians, eh?<br> I need Roman soldiers now.<br> You, get my 10 generals<br> and send them to me at once.<br> Yes, my lord.<br> Well, jump to it!<br> Maps. My maps.<br> Yes, lord.<br> You, get my war chests.<br> Yes, lord.<br> Send carrier pigeons to Ventilius<br> at Tarsus, Drusus at Athens...<br> and to my legions<br> in Philippi...<br> to get under way at once and meet<br> me and my 10 legions at Actium.<br> Yes, lord.<br> Slaves, bring tables!<br> Yes, and get chairs, chairs for my<br> generals! I need Roman soldiers now.<br> So I'm a traitor, am I? They'll<br> take that back on their knees!<br> And as for you and your Egypt,<br> take your choice: Rome or Antony?<br> It's all the same to Antony.<br> Here, you!<br> All right, set it down.<br> I want galleys tomorrow<br> morning to transport 10 legions.<br> Ten legions to Actium.<br> Tomorrow morning?<br> Manned and equipped<br> for six months' siege.<br> The legions will assemble<br> under my generals in the square.<br> Tomorrow morning?<br> At dawn.<br> Now, get out.<br> What answer<br> will you send Octavian?<br> Octavian?<br> Send that to Octavian!<br> I'm at war again!<br> No!<br> Antony! Antony!<br> What's the matter?<br> What is it?<br> At last, I've seen<br> a god come to life.<br> I'm no longer a queen.<br> I'm a woman.<br> You choose me, Cleopatra,<br> against the world?<br> Against the world.<br> Then we'll meet it.<br> We'll smash it to pieces, put it<br> together again, and call it ours!<br> War!<br> Ah, Enobarbus!<br> Come over here.<br> I've my plans all ready.<br> A trap that Octavian will<br> fall into like a little mouse.<br> There'll be no war.<br> Why, what's happened?<br> Disaster.<br> Disaster?<br> Yes, and for Octavian,<br> complete disaster.<br> Where are my generals?<br> They're all here, Antony.<br> And can you blame them?<br> They're Romans. They won't<br> serve under an Egyptian queen.<br> They won't fight<br> for Egypt against Rome.<br> They have gone. They've<br> taken their legions with them.<br> Now they're Octavian's<br> generals, and you are alone.<br> There'll be no war.<br> There will be war!<br> And what will you fight with?<br> The Egyptian army<br> against all of Rome?<br> If that's all we have left,<br> we fight with them.<br> We?<br> What?<br> I'm not here to fight<br> with the Egyptian army.<br> I'm here to tell you that Rome<br> is still yours if you want her.<br> Rome will always<br> love you, Antony.<br> All that Rome wants is<br> your love in return.<br> And there's one way<br> to prove that love.<br> One way, and overnight<br> Octavian will be forgotten...<br> and Rome will take back<br> to her arms her hero.<br> One way.<br> Well?<br> Say the word, and I'll plunge<br> that through a woman's heart.<br> And the report will be that you did it,<br> and Rome will take you back to her heart.<br> There's no room in Rome<br> for Octavian and me.<br> You mean, there's not<br> room enough in your world...<br> for anything else<br> but Cleopatra.<br> Yes. Yes,<br> that's what I mean. Yes.<br> That's what you mean.<br> And you're the man<br> I once heard say to Caesar:<br> "They can't think. They can't<br> fight. They are playthings for us."<br> No man can speak to me<br> like that. Get out!<br> I'm getting out, but I'm<br> taking nothing of yours with me.<br> There's Brittany back.<br> And there's<br> the campaign in Syria.<br> This, you've long forgotten.<br> When I saved your life.<br> And this...<br> when you saved mine.<br> And this...<br> Put them back!<br> No!<br> Our long campaign together lies<br> with the plans on the floor.<br> The war goes on.<br> Is that all you have to say?<br> That's all.<br> Well.<br> Goodbye, Antony.<br> You, who might have been<br> the world's great man...<br> ends all for a woman.<br> For that, I give you<br> the world's contempt.<br> But for what you<br> might have been...<br> I give you my last salute.<br> So Rome would forgive<br> and take you back?<br> And all they demand<br> is for us to part.<br> Why don't they ask the sun<br> to fall right out of the sky?<br> Yes, we'll fight them.<br> We'll fight them all<br> if we have to fight alone.<br> Forward march!<br> Watch the cavalry!<br> Burn the boats! On fire!<br> So you've got it all, eh?<br> All my generals, all my<br> legions, all the Egyptians.<br> Everything I had on land and sea,<br> you've lured and brought away.<br> You've got it all.<br> You've got it all except me!<br> Come down and surrender.<br> You come up and get me!<br> Words. He fights<br> to the last with words.<br> Words. All right, you listen to them.<br> I'll come down and fight you alone!<br> I can think of easier ways<br> for you to die.<br> Well, if you're afraid,<br> I'll fight the lot of you.<br> One by one. Two by two.<br> And if that bores me,<br> I'll fight you three by three!<br> You've forgotten how to fight!<br> You've lost your army!<br> And if I decide to grant your request<br> and choose to be the first you meet...<br> what's the prize?<br> The Egyptian Queen?<br> Wait! Shut up!<br> The Egyptian Queen<br> is no man's prize.<br> She is a warrior of her own<br> and fights by my side.<br> Closer to the wall.<br> Closer to the wall.<br> It's coming down.<br> Don't lower that bridge,<br> you fools! Put it up!<br> Closer to the bridge.<br> He mustn't see us.<br> Put it up again, I say!<br> Majesty, did you<br> see him on the wall?<br> He looked so...<br> Oh, can't I tell him?<br> No! No. He wouldn't<br> believe I could help him...<br> but it's our last chance.<br> I've got to take it.<br> Forward.<br> Look, somebody's coming out.<br> Can you see who it is?<br> The olive branch! They're<br> carrying the olive branch.<br> The Queen of Egypt!<br> Look. Cleopatra.<br> It is the Queen!<br> Cleopatra surrenders!<br> Cleopatra.<br> Come back. Come back.<br> Come back! Come back!<br> He couldn't even keep her!<br> She's a warrior, all right,<br> but she fights by our side!<br> Jump, Antony! Jump!<br> All you've got<br> left now is the wall!<br> He can't keep his woman.<br> Where you going?<br> What's your hurry?<br> Wine. Bring me wine.<br> Look, this is Antony<br> the Roman leader.<br> This is Antony<br> at the square in Tarsus.<br> To send the woman back in chains,<br> then on to Egypt with marching men!<br> Here's to Antony!<br> My lord, can l...<br> Get out.<br> But Tarsus<br> isn't here it seems.<br> Instead, a couch.<br> A couch to lie on.<br> A woman to give your arms to<br> instead of chains.<br> Antony, who can't<br> think or fight.<br> Antony, the plaything<br> of a woman!<br> And there is Egypt.<br> Yours.<br> All I ask is to save his life.<br> Spare him, and I promise<br> you'll never see him again.<br> I shall take him away,<br> far up the Nile...<br> and leave with you Egypt.<br> I suppose of all the requests<br> that have ever been made...<br> yours is the most hopeless.<br> Spare Antony's life?<br> I'd sooner be dead myself.<br> And as for you, this time you<br> do go back to Rome in chains.<br> This time you face a man!<br> Take her away.<br> We can't do that, Excellence.<br> She came bearing the olive branch.<br> What's the difference? We've<br> only to smash the city's gates.<br> Oh, we'll smash<br> the city's gates, all right.<br> But she must have<br> safe conduct back.<br> We are Romans.<br> Oh, all right.<br> Go back and kiss him goodbye.<br> Thank you, soldier.<br> When you smash the gates...<br> you had better come in<br> behind your men.<br> I failed, but there's<br> still a way out for us.<br> I have horses waiting beyond<br> the passage to the tombs...<br> and a boat with trusted rowers<br> will take us to the upper Nile.<br> Antony, we can lose ourselves<br> there and still be happy.<br> Antony, listen.<br> I never wanted<br> to see you again.<br> How deep does a man<br> have to stab to die?<br> Antony!<br> Antony, what...<br> No, no more Antony!<br> Antony's gone.<br> You go back to Octavian.<br> He's the Caesar now.<br> You thought I went to him?<br> You... You thought that of me? Am I blind?<br> I went for your sake.<br> I went to plead for your life.<br> To plead, Antony.<br> I was pleading for your life,<br> and you were taking it.<br> Antony.<br> I am blind indeed.<br> I am dying, Egypt.<br> Dying.<br> Listen. There's little time.<br> Away from war in upper Egypt with<br> you would have been very sweet...<br> but this,<br> this is a better end.<br> A Roman by a Roman conquered.<br> No, no, no.<br> Don't pity me. Don't pity me.<br> We were born for war.<br> It was the soul of our love, and<br> we part at the top of our glory.<br> My precious Cleopatra,<br> I'm happy.<br> The end is in your arms.<br> My love.<br> Take me away with you<br> into the shadows...<br> as close as if you could<br> carry me in your arms.<br> I am taking you with me,<br> Egypt. I am taking you with me.<br> Forever.<br> Antony.<br> Hurry, Majesty. Hurry!<br> They're at the doors.<br> Prepare me.<br> The Queen of Egypt<br> goes to meet the conqueror.<br> The doors are breaking.<br> Royal Egypt, let me die before I see<br> you go to Rome in chains, defeated.<br> I'm not going to Rome,<br> Charmion.<br> Now, give me the basket.<br> It holds victory.<br> It works.<br> Little Iras.<br> Charmion.<br> Look well for love.<br> Look well.<br> And not finding it,<br> give nothing.<br> But if blessed with<br> Cleopatra's fortune...<br> give all.<br> Now, go.<br>
