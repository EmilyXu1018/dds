These planes were reported<br> missing in 1 945.<br> But it looks brand-new!<br> Where's the pilot?<br> I don't understand!<br> Where's the crew?!<br> How the hell did it get here?!<br> He says this guy's local.<br> He was here last night.<br> He saw it happen.<br> Sunburn?<br> He says the sun came out last night.<br> He says it sang to him.<br> Ernie, keep an eye on that point-out.<br> He's on 1 22.5.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Indianapolis Center, you have any<br> traffic for Air East 31?<br> Air East 31 , negative.<br> The only traffic I have is<br> a TWA L-1 01 1 in your 6:00 position...<br> ...range 1 5 miles...<br> ...and an Allegheny DC-9 in your 1 2:00<br> position, 50 miles.<br> Stand by.

I'm just saying<br> that I grew up with Pinocchio.<br> And if kids are still kids,<br> they're gonna eat it up.<br> Okay, I'm wrong.<br> I'm Wrong Roy, all right?<br> Toby! You are close to death!<br> Come out here!<br> I'll give you your choice.<br> I'm not gonna be biased in any way.<br> You can either play Goofy Golf, which<br> means a lot of waiting and pushing...<br> ...or you can see Pinocchio...<br> ...which is a lot of furry animals and<br> magic and a wonderful time.<br> -Now, let's vote.<br> -Golf!<br> All right, everybody to bed!<br> No way! Dad said we could finish<br> watching The Ten Commandments!<br> Roy, that movie is four hours long.<br> I told them<br> they'd watch only five commandments.<br> Hi, Ronnie, it's Earl.<br> We got a big problem.<br> I need your old man in the field.<br> Roy can't drive at night without me.<br> We're experiencing an overall outage!<br> Wait, I can't-- Honey!<br> Jiminy Cricket.<br> It's Earl on the phone.<br> Neary. Get into your truck<br> and report to line N in Tolono.<br> We're losing power across the grid.<br> Has the outage hit you yet?<br> Hey! Lights!<br> Barry!<br> Help! I'm lost.<br> You're gonna cough up a little<br> Tolono, right?<br> Cough up Tolono<br> on Interstate Highway 90.<br> A little familiar landmark<br> of some sort.<br> -Cornbread Road, south of 20.<br> -Cornbread?<br> Power must have been restored.<br> Couple hundred neighbors think<br> it's Saturday night.<br> Dispatch, this is 411.<br> Do you want me to disregard<br> that Tolono call?<br> You're in the middle of the road,<br> jackass!<br> Can you tell me where Cornbread is?<br> Turkey!<br> M-Mary-1 0 through M-Mary-1 2. Okay.<br> Stoppage in the single circuits<br> will lead you right to nowhere.<br> M-Mary-1 0.<br> Oh, shit!<br> What do you guys got out there?<br> I don't believe this!<br> My God! It's as big as a house!<br> Shaped like a barn.<br> This is absolutely crazy.<br> Just off the Telemark Expressway<br> and east toward Harper Valley.<br> No!<br> Watch out!<br> Oh, my God! Lady!<br> Are you okay? I'm sorry.<br> I didn't see him.<br> He was in the middle of the road.<br> Hello!

Hey!<br> That's Ohio!<br> That's a quarter!<br> Jesus, look at those suckers.<br> They're glued to the road!<br> Honey, wake up!<br> Ronnie, wake up!<br> You're not gonna believe what I saw!<br> Don't! Not now.<br> No, listen!<br> I never would have believed it!<br> There was this--<br> In the cab there was this whole--<br> It went-- It was-- There was a red<br> whoosh that--<br> Roy.<br> Ike called you.<br> And McGovern.<br> They want you to call.<br> They couldn't reach you.<br> I turned the radio off.<br> Don't do that. The phone rang<br> off the hook.<br> It woke Sylvia up two times already.<br> You'd better call them.<br> You know those pictures in National<br> Geographic, the aurora borealis?<br> This is better than that. Come on!<br> Come on, Ronnie, get up.<br> -What's wrong?<br> -Nothing. I don't know.<br> -Get up!<br> -Is it an accident?<br> It's not an accident.<br> You wanted out of the house, right?<br> Not at 4:00 in the morning.<br> Ronnie, I need you<br> to see something with me.<br> It's really important.<br> Okay. All right.<br> What about the kids?<br> The kids! I'll get the kids.<br> Sylvia, we're going on an adventure.<br> Toby! Brad! Come on!

Look at you.<br> Honey, what is that?<br> Roy, what did it look like?<br> It was like an ice-cream cone.<br> What flavor?<br> Orange.<br> It was orange.<br> It wasn't like an ice-cream cone.<br> It was more like a shell.<br> Like a taco?<br> Was it like one of those Sara Lee<br> moon-shaped cookies?<br> Those crescent cookies?<br> Don't you think I'm taking this<br> really well?<br> I remember coming to places like<br> this just to look at each other.<br> Snuggle.<br> I don't believe it.<br> I don't believe it!<br> I don't believe it.<br> It's the Cotopaxi.<br> -Why is it here?<br> -Beats the shit out of me.<br> Is this the bathroom?<br> This is not your toy to play with<br> every time I turn around.<br> He looks like a 50l50 Bar.<br> All right, out of this house.<br> All of you. Out of my house.<br> I'm sorry, but you're<br> not to play with this!<br> Get out while I clean up your mess!<br> Thank you very much.<br> I found this overnight tanning stuff.<br> I want you to spray it on half<br> your face, so it's all one color.<br> It makes my face look yellow.<br> What does this remind you of?<br> Then we'll tell everybody<br> you fell asleep...<br> ...under the sun lamp<br> on your right side.<br> What for?<br> Dad, can I ask you a question?<br> Are they for real?<br> That's what for.<br> No, they are not for real.<br> Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?<br> Ronnie, don't tell him that.<br> Don't talk about this until you know<br> what you're talking about.<br> lf I can't talk about it,<br> how will I know what's going on?<br> What?<br> Mom, I believe in them.<br> I believe in them too.<br> No, you don't.<br> Dad says we do.<br> No, he does not.<br> Do you, Roy?<br> All I want to do is know<br> what's going on.<br> Nothing's going on!<br> It's just one of those things.<br> Which things? Which things?<br> -I don't want to hear about this.<br> -This is very important!<br> I won't let it lay here.<br> I'm gonna call somebody!<br> I'm not listening. I'm not listening.<br> I saw something last night<br> that I can't explain.<br> I saw something last night<br> I can't explain.<br> I'm going out there again tonight.<br> No, you're not.<br> Yes, I am.<br> No, you're not.<br> Yes, I am.<br> No, you're not.<br> Do they live on the moon?<br> They got bases there so at night<br> they can come through your window.<br> This isn't a moon burn, goddamn it!<br> -You came through my window last.<br> -You hurt me!<br> -You took all my covers.<br> -Roy's not like that.<br> He loves his work. Don't say that!<br> What did he do?<br> He was with us all night!<br> I won't have to go tonight.<br> He is not like that at all!<br> Stop yelling at me!<br> Can't you tell him about this?<br> Hello?<br> I can't believe it.<br> Roy...<br> ...you got fired.<br> They didn't even want to talk to you.<br> Where were the sounds coming from?<br> Where did these sounds come from?<br> Tell us, please.<br> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br> I beg your pardon,<br> but my English is not good too.<br> I want to share with you now...<br> ...the breakthrough<br> that happened in India.<br> We think it means something.<br> We think it is important.<br> To help you learn, I am using the hand<br> sign created by Zoltn Kodly.<br> Kodly developed these signs<br> to teach music to deaf children.<br> Hello?<br> Hi.<br> Hi, how are you? You came here too?<br> Yes. Jillian Guiler.<br> Roy Neary.<br> Sorry about what happened.<br> -Good night!<br> -What?<br> Look at you.<br> You got the same burn.<br> Yeah, but it's better on you.<br> You got it all over at least.<br> I gotta tan the other side tonight.<br> How's the kid? I'm really sorry.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Raise your head a bit<br> and give me a smile.<br> He's a little young for a record,<br> don't you think?<br> Weird.<br> I know this sounds crazy, but<br> ever since yesterday on the road...<br> ...I've been seeing this shape.<br> In shaving cream and pillows....<br> Damn it, I know this!<br> I know what this is.<br> This means something.<br> This is important.<br> Here they come!<br> Get the camera!<br> Out of the northwest!<br> It's like Halloween for grownups.<br> Trick or treat.<br> Wait a minute!<br> The patterns are:<br> -We received two 1 5-minute broadcasts.<br> -Non-random signals?<br> interval, 40 pulses.<br> Another five-second break,<br> and 30 pulses.<br> then a new set of numbers.<br> -1 04 rapid pulses.<br> -Lord!<br> Wait 60 seconds and the<br> whole doggone thing repeats.<br> -Where are the signals from?<br> -The neighborhood.<br> Light-travel time, roughly 7 seconds.<br> Well within the plane<br> of the ecliptic.<br> Are these non-random signals here, 40,<br> They should be.

Five!<br> We're gonna hold<br> for a couple of minutes.<br> You brought 1 2 people to<br> the decontamination camp...<br> ...instead of the evacuation centre<br> where they belong. Why?<br> -Because this means something.<br> -This means something.<br> These people have come from<br> all over their country...<br> ...to a place they've been told<br> will endanger their lives.<br> Why?<br> Because somebody could be trying<br> to subvert this whole operation...<br> ...by sending in fanatics, cultists<br> and Christ knows what all.<br> This is a small group of people...<br> ...who have shared a vision in common.<br> Look.<br> It's still a mystery to me<br> why they are here.<br> Even they do not know why.<br> Don't!
