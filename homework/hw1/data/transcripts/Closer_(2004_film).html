                        Hello, stranger.<br> Sorry. Looking for a cigarette.<br> I've given up.<br> Thank you.<br> -Got to be somewhere?<br> -Work.<br> You didn't fancy my sandwiches?<br> -Don't eat fish.<br> -Why not?<br> Fish piss in the sea.<br> -So do children.<br> -Don't eat children, either.<br> What's your work?<br> I'm sort of a journalist.<br> -What sort?<br> -I write obituaries.<br> Are we in for a long wait?<br> She was 21 when she came in.<br> Does it hurt?<br> I'll live.<br> Do you want me to put your leg up?<br> Yes, please.<br> Who cut off your crusts?<br> Me.<br> Did your mother cut off your crusts<br> when you were a little boy?<br> -Yes, I believe she did.<br> -You should eat your crusts.<br> You should stop smoking.<br> How long was I out?<br> -About 10 seconds.<br> -Then what?<br> You came to. You focused on me.<br> You said, "Hello, stranger."<br> What a floozy.<br> The cabbie crossed himself, he went,<br> "Thank fuck. I thought I'd killed her."<br> I said, "Let's get her to a hospital."<br> He hesitated.<br> I think he thought there'd be paperwork<br> and he'd be held responsible.<br> So I said with a slight sneer,<br> "Please just drop us at the hospital."<br> Show me the sneer.<br> Very good, buster.<br> Thank you.<br> -I told you, I've given up.<br> -Try harder.<br> You live here?<br> Just arrived from New York.<br> Taking a vacation?<br> I'm on an expedition.<br> Where's your baggage?<br> -Where are you staying?<br> -I'm a waif.<br> A red bus.<br> Policeman or "bobby."<br> Observe the distinctive helmet.<br> Saint Paul's Cathedral.<br> Please note the famous dome.<br> -This is a truly magnificent tour.<br> -It's the London tourists never get to see.<br> -What's this?<br> -I've no idea.<br> They're all people<br> who died saving the lives of others.<br> I've been here before.<br> Twenty years ago, we came here.<br> My mother's dead. My father and I came here<br> the afternoon she died.<br> She was a smoker.<br> She died in the hospital, actually.<br> -ls your father still alive?<br> -Hanging on.<br> He's in a home.<br> -You're late for work.<br> -You saying you want me to go?<br> I'm saying you're late for work.<br> How did you end up writing obituaries?<br> Well, I had dreams of being a writer,<br> but I had no voice.<br> What am I saying? I had no talent.<br> So I ended up in obituaries,<br> which is the Siberia of journalism.<br> Tell me what you do.<br> I want to imagine you in Siberia.<br> Really?<br> We call it "the obits page."<br> There's three of us:. me, Graham, and Harry.<br> When I get to work, without fail....<br> Are you sure you want to know?<br> Well, if someone important died,<br> we go to the "deep freeze"...<br> which is a computer file...<br> with all the obituaries,<br> and we find the dead person's life.<br> People's obituaries are written<br> while they're still alive?<br> Some people's.<br> Then Harry, he's the editor,<br> decides who we'll lead with.<br> Then we make calls, check facts.<br> At 6:.00, we stand around the computer<br> and look at the next day's page...<br> and make final changes.<br> Add a few euphemisms<br> for our own amusement.<br> Such as?<br> "He was a convivial fellow."<br> Meaning he was an alcoholic.<br> "He valued his privacy." Gay.<br> "He enjoyed his privacy." Raging queen.<br> What would my euphemism be?<br> -"She was disarming."<br> -That's not a euphemism.<br> Yes, it is.<br> -What were you doing in New York?<br> -You know.<br> Well, no, I don't. What, were you studying?<br> Stripping.<br> Look at your little eyes.<br> I can't see my little eyes.<br> Why did you leave?<br> Problems with a male.<br> -Boyfriend?<br> -Kind of.<br> And you left him, just like that?<br> It's the only way to leave.<br> "l don't love you anymore. Goodbye."<br> -Supposing you do still love them?<br> -You don't leave.<br> -You've never left somebody you still love?<br> -No.<br> This is me.<br> Enjoy your stay.<br> Please remember<br> our traffic tends to come from the right.<br> Bye.<br> Do you have a girlfriend?<br> Yeah. Ruth.<br> She's called Ruth. She's a linguist.<br> -What's your name?<br> -Alice.<br> My name is Alice Ayres.<br> Good.<br> I'm just gonna change the film.<br> Are you okay for time?<br> -Do you mind if I smoke?<br> -lf you must.<br> -I don't have to.<br> -Then don't.<br> I liked your book.<br> Thanks.<br> -When's it published?<br> -Next year.

She's someone called Alice.<br> How does she feel<br> about you stealing her life?<br> Borrowing her life.<br> I'm dedicating the book to her.<br> She's pleased.<br> Do you exhibit?<br> Sometimes. I have a thing next year.<br> Portraits?<br> -Of who?<br> -Strangers.<br> How do your strangers feel<br> about you stealing their lives?<br> Borrowing.<br> Am I a stranger?<br> No. You're a job.<br> And you're a sloucher. Sit up.<br> You didn't find it obscene?<br> -What?<br> -The book.<br> I thought it was accurate.<br> About what?<br> About sex. About love.<br> In what way?<br> -You wrote it.<br> -You read it till 4:.00.<br> Don't raise your eyebrows.<br> It makes you look smug.<br> -But you did like it?<br> -Yes, but I could go off it.<br> Stand up.<br> Any criticisms?<br> I'm not sure about the title.<br> Got a better one?<br> The Aquarium.<br> So you liked the filth.<br> -You like aquariums.<br> -Fish are therapeutic.<br> -Hang out in aquariums, do you?<br> -When I can.<br> Good for picking up strangers?<br> Photographing strangers.<br> Come here.<br> You're beautiful.<br> I don't kiss strange men.<br> Neither do l.<br> Do you and this Alice live together?<br> Yes.<br> Are you married?<br> Yes.<br> -No. Yes.<br> -Which?<br> Separated.<br> -Do you have any children?<br> -No.<br> -Would you like some?<br> -Yes, but not today.<br> Would Alice like children?<br> She's too young.<br> She works in a caf near here.<br> She's coming to meet me.<br> Quite soon.<br> Why are you wasting her time?<br> -You're judgmental.<br> -You're devious.<br> I'm not wasting her time.<br> She's completely lovable.<br> And completely unleavable.<br> And you don't want someone else<br> getting their dirty hands on her.<br> -Men are crap.<br> -But all the same - -<br> They're still crap.<br> Your muse.<br> -You've ruined my life.<br> -You'll get over it.<br> Dan.<br> Your shirt.<br> You all done?<br> -How's the photographer?<br> -Good.

It's him.<br> -No, I was talking to a woman.<br> -How do you know?<br> Believe me, she was a woman.<br> I got a huge....<br> She was a.... She wasn't, was she?<br> No.<br> What a bastard.<br> How do you know him?<br> I don't really know him.<br> I took his photograph for a book he wrote.<br> -I hope it sank without a trace.<br> -It's on its way.<br> There is justice in the world.<br> What's it called?<br> The Aquarium.<br> What a prick! He's advertising.<br> But why would he pretend to be you?<br> I think he likes me.<br> Funny way of showing it.<br> Can't he send you flowers?<br> Extraordinary thing, the lnternet.<br> Possibility of genuine<br> global communication.<br> The first great democratic medium.<br> Absolutely. It's the future.<br> Two guys wanking in cyberspace.<br> He was the wanker.<br> I'll say this for him, he can write.<br> Is he in love with you?<br> I don't know.

Why is this?<br> Please let me come.<br> I want to be there for you.<br> -Are you ashamed of me?<br> -Of course not. I told you...<br> -I want to be alone.<br> -Why?<br> To grieve.<br> To think.<br> -I love you. Why won't you let me?<br> -It's only a weekend.<br> Why won't you let me love you?<br> Buster.<br> Let's go to this thing...<br> then I'll get my train. I'll be away one night.<br> I'll be back before you know it, okay?<br> Do these people pay you?<br> Or do you pay them?<br> Like it?<br> No.<br> What were you so sad about?<br> -Life.<br> -What's that, then?<br> So what do you reckon, in general?<br> You want to talk about art?<br> I know it's vulgar to discuss The Work<br> at an opening of The Work...<br> but someone's got to do it.<br> I'm serious. What do you think?<br> It's a lie.<br> It's a bunch of sad strangers<br> photographed beautifully...<br> and all the glittering assholes<br> who appreciate art...<br> say it's beautiful<br> because that's what they want to see.<br> But the people in the photos are sad...<br> and alone.<br> But the pictures<br> make the world seem beautiful...<br> so the exhibition's reassuring,<br> which makes it a lie.<br> And everyone loves a big, fat lie.<br> -I'm the big, fat liar's boyfriend.<br> -Bastard.<br> -Larry.<br> -Alice.<br> So you're Anna's boyfriend.<br> A princess can kiss a toad.<br> -Frog.<br> -Toad.<br> -Frog.<br> -Toad, frog, lobster. They're all the same.<br> So how long have you been seeing her?<br> Four months. We're in the first flush.<br> It's paradise. All my nasty habits amuse her.<br> -You shouldn't smoke.<br> -Fuck off.<br> I'm a doctor.<br> I'm supposed to say things like that.<br> -You want one?<br> -No.<br> Yes. No.<br> Fuck it, yes.<br> No.<br> I've given up.<br> Anna tells me your bloke wrote a book.<br> -Any good?<br> -Of course.<br> It's about you, isn't it?<br> -Some of me.<br> -Oh? What did he leave out?<br> The truth.<br> Is he here, your bloke?<br> Yeah, he's over there talking to your bird.<br> My boyfriend's here.<br> He's here? Where?<br> There.<br> With Alice?<br> I believe you're acquainted.<br> -I've never seen him before.<br> -No.<br> But you've spoken.<br> Well, conversed.<br> -Corresponded.<br> -I wrote to him?<br> On the Net. You sent him to the aquarium.<br> I happened to be there.<br> Nice work, Cupid.<br> -We need to talk about this.<br> -No, we don't.<br> He's very pretty.<br> She is very tall.<br> So you're a stripper?<br> Yeah.<br> And?<br> You take care, now.<br> I will.<br> You, too.<br> That's the way it should be.<br> He's very funny.<br> Excuse me.

The old jokes...<br> the strange familiarity.<br> I think you had a whale of a time.<br> And the truth is I'll never know<br> unless I ask him.<br> Why don't you?<br> Yes?<br> You can go in now.<br> -I want Anna back.<br> -She's made her choice.<br> I owe you an apology. I fell in love with her.<br> My intention was not to make you suffer.<br> So where's the apology? You cunt.<br> I apologize.<br> If you love her, you'll let her go...<br> so she can be happy.<br> -She doesn't want to be happy.<br> -Everybody wants to be happy.<br> Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy<br> to confirm they're depressed.<br> If they were happy,<br> they couldn't be depressed.<br> They'd have to go out into the world<br> and live, which can be depressing.<br> -Anna's not a depressive.<br> -lsn't she?<br> -I love her.<br> -Boo -hoo. So do l.<br> She's gone back to you<br> because she can't bear your suffering.<br> You don't know who she is.<br> -You love her like a dog loves its owner.<br> -And the owner loves the dog for so doing.<br> You'll hurt her. You'll never forgive her.<br> Of course I forgive her. I have forgiven her.<br> Without forgiveness we're savages.<br> You're drowning.<br> -You only met her because of me.<br> -Yeah. Thanks.<br> It's a joke. Your marriage is a joke.<br> Here's a good one. She never sent<br> the divorce papers to her lawyer.<br> Now, to a towering romantic hero like you,<br> I don't doubt I am somewhat common.<br> But I am, nevertheless,<br> what she has chosen...<br> and we must respect what the woman wants.<br> If you go near her again, I swear...<br> I will kill you.<br> Okay. I have patients to see.<br> When she came here,<br> do you think she enjoyed it?<br> I didn't do it to give her a nice time.<br> I fucked her to fuck you up.<br> A good fight is never clean.<br> And of course she enjoyed it.<br> As you know, she loves a guilty fuck.<br> -You're an animal.<br> -Yeah? What are you?<br> You think love is simple.<br> You think the heart is like a diagram.<br> Have you ever seen a human heart?<br> It looks like a fist wrapped in blood!<br> Go fuck yourself. You writer!<br> You liar!<br> You go check a few facts<br> while I get my hands dirty.<br> She hates your hands.<br> She hates your simplicity.<br> I spent the whole of last week<br> talking about you.<br> I know all your ways. Anna says<br> you fucked her with your eyes closed.<br> She tells me you wake in the night<br> crying for your mother, you mommy's boy.<br> I could go on.<br> Shall we stop this?<br> It's over. Accept it.<br> You don't know the first thing about love...<br> because you don't understand compromise.<br> -Don't cry on me.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> You want my advice? You go back to Alice.<br> She'd never have me.<br> -She's vanished.<br> -No, she hasn't.<br> I found her, by accident.<br> She's working in a club.<br> Yes, I saw her naked.<br> No, I did not fuck her.<br> You spoke to her?<br> Yes, I know. One minute.<br> How is she?<br> She loves you...<br> beyond comprehension.<br> Your prescription.<br> It's where she works.<br> Go to her.<br> Thank you.<br> You still pissing about on the Net?<br> Not recently.<br> -I wanted to kill you.<br> -I thought you wanted to fuck me.<br> Don't get lippy.<br> I liked your book, by the way.<br> Thanks. You stand alone.<br> With Anna.<br> -You still writing obituaries? Busy?<br> -I was made editor.<br> -Yeah? How come?<br> -Previous editor died.<br> Alcohol poisoning.<br> I sat with him for a week in the hospital.<br> I really do have patients to see.<br> -Thank you.<br> -For what?<br> -Being kind.<br> -I am kind.<br> Your invoice is in the post.<br> I lied to you.<br> I did fuck Alice.<br> Sorry for telling you.<br> I'm just not big enough to forgive you.<br> Buster.<br> Show me the sneer.<br> Beautiful.<br> You'll wake up the hotel.<br> Fuck me.<br> Again? We have to get up at 6::00.<br> How can one man<br> be so endlessly disappointing?<br> That's my charm.<br> So where are we going?<br> -My treat.<br> -Where are we going?<br> My holiday surprise. My rules.<br> Where are we going?<br> New York.<br> You angel.<br> -You did remember to pack my passport?<br> -Of course. It's with my passport.<br> And where's that?<br> In a place where you can't look.<br> No one sees my passport picture.<br> When we get on the plane,<br> we'll have been together four years.<br> What about the gap?<br> You mean trial separation? Didn't work out.<br> Happy anniversary.<br> I'm going to take my eyes out.<br> -What was in my sandwiches?<br> -Tuna.<br> -How many stitches did I get?<br> -Two.<br> But you should have had three.<br> -What was your euphemism?<br> -Disarming.<br> Too easy, buster. Next?<br> That park. Who'd I go there with?<br> Your father.<br> Were the chairs in the hospital gray or blue?<br> -No idea.<br> -Trick question. They were green.<br> You are a trick question.<br> How come we never took a vacation?<br> We went to the country.<br> Doesn't count. You were off<br> making sneaky phone calls...<br> to that witch we do not mention.<br> Come to bed.<br> I need a smoke.<br> -How'd you manage to give up?<br> -Deep inner strength.<br> Why me?<br> You could have chosen anyone.
