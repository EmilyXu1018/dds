                        - You okay?<br> - I'm fine, mate. Don't worry about it.<br> You all right?<br> Enjoy L.A.<br> - He did it.<br> - It's all right.<br> Tell me why everything<br> is always about you.<br> Everything is not always about me.<br> That gearhead with his<br> pocket protector was being sarcastic,<br> - and you know it.<br> - Sorry, I just didn't see it that way.<br> Bullshit. What about the dig about<br> the makeover? That was really nice.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> I work with the man, for chrissake.<br> You know what? You're perfectly<br> capable of taking care of your own shit.<br> You know something? The last time<br> I checked, you were sleeping with me.<br> So unless you want to start<br> fucking him, I suggest...<br> Hey, pal. Where can I catch a shuttle<br> to the airport around here?<br> - Back there.<br> - Thanks.<br> It was him in that gold Lexus<br> on the cell phone.<br> Are they still asking<br> for a change of venue?<br> He's enhanceable because of priors<br> in the early '80s.<br> - Where to?<br> - Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.<br> Downtown.<br> Look, the transcriptions need<br> to be done by 7 a.m., period, okay?<br> Hold on. Take Sepulveda<br> to Slauson to La Brea.<br> Take La Brea north to Sixth<br> into downtown.<br> So what? You'll be up late. I'm pulling<br> an all-nighter too, so save the tears.<br> I'll take the 105 east to the 110.<br> - That's faster.<br> - What?<br> I said, the 105 to the 110,<br> that'll get you there quicker.<br> The 110 turns into a parking lot<br> around USC.<br> But once you get to La Brea north<br> of Santa Monica, then it's jammed.<br> The 110 north of the 10,<br> you get people driving to Pasadena,<br> and they drive slow.<br> Yeah, they do, but what I do is<br> I get off on Grand, and then I...<br> Hey, surface roads is what you want,<br> that's what we'll do.<br> - Are we taking bets?<br> - Are we?<br> But what if you're wrong?<br> I don't think I'm gonna be wrong,<br> but if I am, the ride's free.<br> Okay, you got yourself a deal.<br> - Go ahead, say it.<br> - Say what?<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Oh, I got lucky with the lights.<br> You weren't lucky with the lights.<br> What you were was right.<br> I was wrong...<br> ...Max.<br> You mind turning that up?<br> - You like the classics.<br> - I do. I used to play in high school.<br> - Let me guess. Woodwinds.<br> - No. Strings.<br> I never had the lungs<br> for wind instruments.<br> Could've fooled me by the way<br> you were unloading on that cell phone.<br> Different instrument.<br> If you had just listened to me, we'd be<br> all bogged down in traffic right now,<br> and you would've made yourself<br> an extra 5 bucks.<br> Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.<br> Buy you something special. Go wild.<br> Really, it's not that... It's not a big deal.<br> Nothing big here.<br> Well, how many cabbies<br> do you know<br> get you into an argument<br> to save you money?<br> There were two of us. I had to kill<br> the other one. I don't like competition.<br> Take pride in being good<br> at what you do?<br> What, this? Oh, this is...<br> This is... No, this is part-time.<br> This is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.<br> But I will be the best at what I do.<br> But that's something else.<br> - What else?<br> - Just shaping up some things.<br> Like...?<br> Tell me.<br> Limo company I'm putting together.<br> Island Limos.<br> It's gonna be like an island on wheels.<br> A cool groove, like a club experience.<br> When you get to the airport, you're not<br> gonna wanna get out of my limo.<br> So I do this part-time<br> to get my Benz off leases,<br> staff up, get the right client list.<br> You know, things like that.<br> How do you like being a lawyer?<br> - What are you, psychic?<br> - Little bit.<br> There's the dark pinstripe suit.<br> Elegant, not too flashy.<br> That rules out advertising.<br> Plus a top-drawer briefcase<br> that you live out of.<br> And the purse. A Bottega.<br> Anyway, a man gets in my cab with<br> a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.<br> You? Clarence Darrow.<br> Well, no, not quite.<br> He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.<br> - Big case?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Got us here fast.<br> - Of course.<br> But you didn't answer my question.<br> Do you like what you do?<br> Yeah.<br> But not today.<br> No, I do. Like, I can't wait.<br> I love standing in that courtroom.<br> At the same time,<br> I get this clenched-up thing<br> the night before the first days.<br> Clenched up? How?<br> I think I'm gonna lose.<br> I think the case sucks,<br> my exhibits aren't in order,<br> I'm not prepared enough,<br> people are gonna find out<br> that I don't know what I'm doing,<br> and I've been running some charade<br> all these years.<br> I represent<br> the Department of Justice,<br> and my opening statement is gonna<br> fall flat at the most important point,<br> and the jury's gonna laugh at me.<br> And then I cry. I don't throw up.<br> A lot of people throw up.<br> I have a strong stomach.<br> And then I pull myself together,<br> I rewrite my opening statement,<br> work my exhibits, and that's<br> what I do for the rest of the night.<br> That's my routine.<br> - In the morning, it starts, and I'm fine.<br> - You need a vacation.<br> I just had a vacation<br> on the Harbor Freeway.<br> No, no, not in a cab. I mean,<br> you need to get your head straight.<br> Get your unified self up.<br> Get harmonic. You know...<br> When was the last time<br> you took a break?<br> I go on a vacation all the time.<br> - How often?<br> - A dozen times a day.<br> My favorite spot.<br> Maldives Island.<br> It's my own private getaway.<br> Things get heavy for me,<br> I take five minutes out,<br> and I just go there.<br> And I just concentrate<br> on absolutely nothing.<br> - Here. Take it.<br> - Oh, no. I couldn't do that.<br> Take it. Take it, because you<br> need it a lot more than I do.<br> And it'll help you. I guarantee it.<br> Thanks, Max.<br> Go get 'em.<br> Hey.<br> I don't know,<br> in case you ever wanna investigate<br> a Fortune 500 company or...<br> ...argue cab routes.<br> Hey.<br> Oh, whoa, whoa. Hey, yeah.<br> Come on, man, I'm sorry.<br> I didn't hear you, man.<br> Come on. I'll take you.<br> - Where to?<br> - 1039 South Union Street.<br> Gotcha.<br> - How long you think this'll take?<br> - Seven minutes.<br> Seven. Not eight? Not six?<br> Two minutes to get across the 110<br> to Normandie.<br> Normandie to Venice, three minutes.<br> Over to Union is one.<br> Plus one for "shit happens."<br> - Okay if I time you?<br> - Knock yourself out.<br> What do I get if you're wrong?<br> A free ride?<br> You get an apology.<br> I already offered my free ride today.<br> - To who?<br> - Some girl.<br> Did you get a date with her?<br> - First time in L.A.?<br> - No.<br> Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here<br> I can't wait to leave.<br> Too sprawled out, disconnected.<br> You know.<br> - That's me. You like it?<br> - It's my home.<br> Seventeen million people.<br> This was a country,<br> it'd be the fifth biggest economy in the<br> world, and nobody knows each other.<br> I read about this guy,<br> gets on the MTA here, dies.<br> Six hours he's riding the subway<br> before anybody notices his corpse<br> doing laps around L.A.,<br> people on and off sitting next to him.<br> Nobody notices.<br> This is the cleanest cab<br> I've ever been in.<br> - Regular ride?<br> - Yeah, I share it with the day-shift guy.<br> - Because you prefer nights?<br> - Yeah, people are more relaxed.<br> Less stress, less traffic, better tips.<br> - How are the benefits?<br> - Oh, no. It's not that kind of job.<br> I'm not in this for the long haul.<br> I'm just filling in, you know.<br> Just temporary while I'm getting<br> some things shaped up.<br> This is just temporary.<br> - How long you been driving?<br> - Twelve years.<br> Really?<br> What other things<br> you putting together?<br> You know, I don't wanna talk about it.<br> Just a little business plan.<br> - No offense. I just...<br> - None taken.<br> You're one of these guys that do<br> instead of talk. That's cool.<br> - Seven minutes. Man, you're good.<br> - I got lucky with the lights.<br> Yeah, sure. You probably know<br> the light schedules too.<br> Listen, I'm in town on<br> a real-estate deal, close in one night.<br> I got five stops to make.<br> Collect signatures, see some friends,<br> and then I got a 6 a.m. Out of LAX.<br> Why don't you hang with me.<br> The car's not for hire, man.<br> That's against regs.<br> - Regulations?<br> - Yeah.<br> These guys don't pay you sick leave.<br> How much you pull down a shift?<br> - How much?<br> - 350, 400.<br> Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.<br> I'll make it 600.<br> - Man, I don't know.<br> - Plus an extra hundred<br> you get me to LAX<br> and I don't have to run for the plane.<br> Oh, no, guy.<br> I don't know about this.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Yeah, you do.<br> - Man, I don't know, man.<br> - Yeah, you do.<br> Six hundred...<br> Cool.

You like jazz?<br> - Not that much.<br> Guy told me about this place<br> off Crenshaw.<br> Leimert Park.<br> All the West Coast greats played there.<br> Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,<br> Chet Baker. Like that.<br> Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.<br> This informant of yours,<br> what's his name? Ramone?<br> Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him<br> in Bellflower last night.<br> He doesn't show up,<br> I roll here, find this.<br> Yeah, how long<br> you been working this guy?<br> Four months. He's a low-level player.<br> Part of a distribution network<br> that hooks up to Felix.<br> Felix Reyes-Torrena?<br> Feds are all over him.<br> They don't want us anywhere near it.<br> Since when's L.A.P.D. Working<br> for the Feeb?<br> If they're into it,<br> they're just gonna take all our stuff,<br> build their case, take all the credit.<br> So, what is the point?<br> The point is, is my guy<br> flew out a window.<br> So if my CI flies out a window,<br> Is there a crime here? A homicide?<br> You got a body?<br> - I just see a bunch of broken glass.<br> - And blood.<br> Down here, in the glass.<br> Here's some more.<br> And there's some spatter patterns<br> over there and over here.<br> - Richard?<br> - Yeah, it's me.<br> Ramone went through that window,<br> splat.<br> Glass here, then tires rolled over it.<br> - Maybe he jumped.<br> - Sure.<br> He's depressed, so he jumps four<br> stories out of a window onto his head.<br> "Wow, that feels better."<br> Picks himself up.<br> "Now I think I'll go on<br> with the rest of my day."<br> - Come on, man.<br> - Hey, Ray! Catch.<br> - Recent?<br> - You can still smell the cordite.<br> Old guy across the alley<br> watching late-night TV<br> says he saw a cab parked here<br> earlier tonight<br> with two guys<br> walking around the hood.<br> Description? He see anything?<br> Kind of saw.<br> Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.<br> There are 4,000 taxicabs<br> in L.A. County.<br> - You got anything else?<br> - That's it.<br> Okay. Keep knocking.<br> Let's keep knocking.<br> Remember that<br> Bay Area deal? Oakland?<br> Cabby drove around all night,<br> killed three people,<br> then put the gun to his head.<br> The guy flipped out. So what?<br> So that Oakland PD detective,<br> what's-his-name, never bought it.<br> Cabby had no criminal record,<br> no history of mental illness.<br> Pops three people, then himself?<br> Anyway, that detective always thought<br> there was someone else in that cab.<br> I never learned to listen to jazz.<br> It's off melody. Behind the notes.<br> Not what's expected.<br> - Improvising, like tonight.<br> - Like tonight?<br> Most people, ten years from now,<br> same job, same place, same routine.<br> Everything the same.<br> Just keeping it safe<br> over and over and over.<br> Ten years from now.<br> Man, you don't know where you'll be<br> ten minutes from now.<br> Do you?<br> - Who is that on the trumpet?<br> - That's Daniel, baby, he's the owner.<br> He's terrific. Would you be so kind<br> as to invite him over after his set?<br> - I gotta buy him a drink.<br> - Sure thing, darling.<br> No, now, see, I was about 19,<br> bussing tables right here.<br> The money wasn't shit,<br> but that wasn't the point.<br> It was about being around the music.<br> And I was.<br> I mean, take this one night.<br> July 22nd, 1964. Who you think<br> walks through that door?<br> Bye, baby.<br> Miles Davis. That's right.<br> - In the flesh?<br> - That's right.<br> I'm talking about, through those doors,<br> the coolest man on the planet.<br> Jesus.<br> Anyway, he had been<br> at a recording session<br> up at Columbia, up on Vine.<br> So Miles comes through that door.<br> Before you know it, he's up on<br> the bandstand, jamming with the band.<br> - I mean, it had to be...<br> - Oh, it was scary.<br> I mean, the dude was<br> so focused, man.<br> Plus, he was kind of<br> a scary cat anyway, man.<br> I mean, everybody<br> and their mama knew<br> that you don't just come up<br> and talk to Miles Davis.<br> I mean, he may have looked like he<br> was chilling, but he was absorbed.<br> This one young, hip couple, one of<br> them tried to shake his hand one day.<br> And the guy says, "Hi, my name is..."<br> Miles said, "Get the fuck out<br> of my face, you jive motherfucker.<br> Take your silly bitch with you."<br> You know? That's...<br> That was Miles, man.<br> That's the way he was when he was<br> in his musical headspace. Fierce.<br> But did you get to talk to him?<br> - Better than that.<br> - No.<br> - I played for about 20 minutes.<br> - Unbelievable.<br> - How'd you do?<br> - How'd I do?<br> Well, you really ain't shit when<br> you're playing next to Miles Davis.<br> But he carried my ass.<br> - What'd he say?<br> - He said one word, "Cool."<br> - "Cool"?<br> - Yeah.<br> - That's it?<br> - Yeah.<br> That meant, "Good, but not ready."<br> It meant,<br> "Look me up when you are."<br> - Did you?<br> - No.<br> I got drafted and got<br> into some other things.<br> And by the time I got back to music,<br> the season had passed.<br> But, you know, I was born in 1945,<br> but that night was<br> the moment of my conception.<br> - Right here in this room.<br> - Crowd's not here now.<br> Well, jazz ain't the draw<br> that it used to be.<br> What a great story.<br> I gotta tell the people in Culiacn<br> and Cartagena that story.<br> You know the folks in Culiacn<br> and Cartagena?<br> Afraid so.<br> Man, just when I thought<br> you were a cool guy.<br> I am a cool guy,<br> with a job I contracted to do.<br> Come on, Vincent,<br> give the dude a pass.<br> - I'm working here.<br> - Listen. You the one<br> talking about improvisation. You like<br> the guy, you like how he plays.<br> - Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.<br> - Improvi...<br> That's funny, coming from you.<br> How's this? I'll ask a question.<br> - What question?<br> - A jazz question.<br> Now, you get it right, we roll.<br> You disappear tonight.<br> If I walk out of here tonight,<br> I will go so far away,<br> it'll be just like I was dead.<br> And one more thing:<br> These people<br> and their rep here, Felix.<br> Well, you tell them I'm sorry.<br> You tell them I had to.<br> They laid a grant of immunity on me.<br> I was compelled. It was either<br> play ball or go back inside.<br> And I'm not going back inside.<br> Yeah.<br> Lay it on me.<br> Where did Miles learn music?<br> I know everything there is<br> to know about Miles.<br> Then let's have it.<br> Music school.<br> He got into music school, right?<br> His father was a dentist,<br> East St. Louis.<br> Invested in agriculture,<br> made plenty of money.<br> He sent Miles<br> to Juilliard School of Music,<br> New York, 1945.<br> Man.<br> Dropped out of Juilliard<br> after less than a year.<br> Tracked down Charlie Parker<br> on 52nd Street,<br> who mentored him<br> for the next three years.<br> - Hey.<br> - No. No, I'm done.<br> - Find you another cab.<br> - Max.<br> Leave me alone.<br> I'm collateral anyway.<br> I am not playing.<br> You played him, man.<br> He got the answer right,<br> would you have let him go?<br> This is 102. This is 102. Max?<br> - What is it with this guy?<br> - Max?<br> - You hassling my driver again?<br> - Who are you?<br> The same guy<br> you talked to last time.<br> Max's mother's driving me crazy.<br> Put him on the line, please.<br> Hang on.<br> Carefully.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Your mother's calling<br> every ten minutes.<br> Why didn't you show?<br> Are you all right?<br> Where are you?<br> Show for what?<br> Tell her I can't make it tonight.<br> I'm not related to you.<br> You tell her yourself.<br> Show up for what?<br> She's in the hospital.<br> - You visit every night?<br> - Yeah. What difference does it make?<br> - You don't show up, it breaks routine.<br> - So?<br> So people start looking for you,<br> this cab. That's not good.<br> I'm not taking you to see my mother.<br> Since when was<br> any of this negotiable?<br> Two paces ahead, one to the left.<br> Hey. Flowers?<br> It's a waste of money.<br> Won't mean a thing to her.<br> She carried you in her womb<br> for nine months.<br> People buy flowers. Buy flowers.<br> Excuse me. Keep the change.<br> Hold that elevator, please.<br> - Floor?<br> - Five. Thanks.<br> - Having a good night?<br> - Mezzo e mezzo. You?<br> Excuse me.<br> Hey, Ma.<br> - I've been calling and calling.<br> - Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.<br> Why couldn't you call me<br> on the telephone?<br> I'm lying here wondering<br> if something terrible happened to you.<br> - I brought you flowers.<br> - What am I gonna do with flowers?<br> - Cheer up.<br> - How?<br> By worrying that you spend money<br> on stuff that's just gonna wilt and die?<br> See what I mean? I didn't buy<br> you the flowers, Mom. He did.<br> Who?<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> we had company?<br> What's your name?<br> Sorry my son is rude.<br> No harm done, ma'am.<br> You paid for my flowers?<br> They're beautiful.<br> Well, Max?<br> Mother, this is Vincent.<br> Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.<br> I'm very happy to meet you,<br> Mrs. Durocher.<br> Oh, just call me Ida.<br> Ida. I was with Max<br> when he got the call.<br> And you came all the way<br> over here to see me?<br> - It's nothing, ma'am.<br> - Tell my son.<br> You have to hold a gun to his head<br> to make him do anything.<br> You must be one of Max's<br> important clients.<br> Client? I... You know, I like<br> to think of myself as his friend.<br> Max never had many friends.<br> Always talking to himself<br> in the mirror. It's unhealthy.<br> How many times I got to ask you?<br> Please don't do that.<br> Do what?<br> Don't talk about me like<br> I'm not right here in the room here.<br> What's he saying?<br> He says he's standing right here,<br> in the room here.<br> Yes, you are. He's sensitive.<br> I know. But I'm sure<br> you're very proud of him.<br> Of course I'm proud.<br> He started with nothing, you know.<br> - Look at him today. Here, Vegas...<br> - Mom. Mom.<br> Mom. Mom, he is not interested<br> in hearing about all that, okay?<br> I came to see you, I saw you,<br> you look good, let's go.<br> No, no, no. No, no, no.<br> I am very interested, Ida. Please.<br> - Limousine companies.<br> - Is that right?<br> He drives famous people around.<br> Famous people.<br> Limousine companies.<br> Now, that's quite an achievement.<br> What did you say<br> your name was again?<br> My name's Vincent, ma'am.<br> - Visit again?<br> - No, I'm just in town tonight.<br> - When you come back.<br> - Sure.<br> Max!<br> Don't!<br> All my prep was in there.<br> You are screwing with my work.<br> Let's see what else you can do.<br> Well, I've had four come in tonight.<br> Maybe one's your guy.<br> No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.<br> No, next.<br> You know, something's funny<br> about this, though, you know?<br> These three all came in within<br> half an hour of each other, right?<br> The kid and that last guy,<br> both done by the same shooter, I think.<br> - Why do you say that?<br> - Wound pattern.<br> Two in the sternum, one in the head.<br> This guy, he's shooting tight<br> groups too, all right? Check this out.<br> Double taps are a couple<br> millimetres apart.<br> Let's see this one.<br> See what I mean?<br> - Holy shit. Can I use your phone?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on, come on, wake up.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hey, it's Fanning.<br> I'm still down here at the morgue<br> at Sisters of Charity.<br> The John Does didn't pan out,<br> but you'll never guess<br> - who I got here in the meat locker.<br> - Who?<br> Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney<br> turned lawyer-criminal.<br> Including Ramone,<br> who he represented,<br> who's still missing.<br> The both of whom are in the<br> exotic-substances business together.<br> There's something going on,<br> and I don't think the feds<br> know about it.<br> Tell you what, stay on your cell phone.<br> I got the ASAC's phone. I'll hook up<br> - with you in 30 minutes.<br> - Good.<br> You're gonna go to a place<br> called El Rodeo.<br> It's on Washington Boulevard<br> in Pico Rivera.<br> - Where at on Washington?<br> - Look it up.<br> Limos, huh?<br> Don't start.<br> Hey, I'm not the one<br> lying to my mother.<br> She hears what she wants to hear.<br> I don't disillusion her.<br> Yeah, right. Maybe she hears<br> what you tell her.<br> Whatever I tell her is never<br> good enough anyway.<br> It's always been that way.<br> - So, what's at El Rodeo?<br> - Just drive.<br> They project onto you their flaws.<br> What they don't like about themselves,<br> their lives, whatever.<br> They rank on you instead.<br> - How do you know?<br> - I had a father like that.<br> Mothers are worse.<br> Wouldn't know. My mother died<br> before I remember.<br> What happened to your father?<br> Hated everything I did.<br> Got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.<br> Went back with him. Like that.<br> Then what?<br> I killed him.<br> I was 12.<br> I'm kidding.<br> He died of liver disease.<br> - Well, I'm sorry.<br> - No, you're not.<br> So, what is this "driving a cab<br> temporarily"? It's just all bullshit, huh?<br> - It is not bullshit.<br> - Twelve years isn't temporary, Max.<br> Gotta get the cash together.<br> Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.<br> Gotta staff up,<br> get the right client list.<br> It's not just simply get the car<br> and put asses in the seats.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because Island Limos<br> is more than just a ride. It's a...<br> Like a club experience. Cool groove.<br> Don't want it to end.<br> It's gotta be perfect.<br> Perfect.<br> It's up here. Turn right.<br> - Give me your wallet. Come on.<br> - Give you my wallet. For what?<br> I'll hold it for you in case<br> the people inside search you.<br> - Who's searching?<br> - The people inside.<br> Go in, ask for Felix.<br> He's expecting you.<br> - Felix.<br> - Yeah.<br> - What does he look like?<br> - I don't know, I've never met him.<br> Who is he?<br> He's connected to the guys<br> who hired me.<br> - I don't get it.<br> - You destroyed my workups.<br> Number four's due.<br> What'd you think, night's over?<br> Called on account of rain?<br> You go in there, say you're me.<br> Score the backups.<br> They'll be on flash drive or CD.<br> - Me? How come you don't go?<br> - I don't meet people.<br> Risk management. Anonymity. I protect<br> mine. You're not gonna screw that up.<br> I got a contract with their bosses.<br> These guys don't get to meet me.<br> They don't know what I look like.<br> If I don't pull it off, then...<br> They will kill you.<br> Now, you got ten minutes.<br> At 10:01, I drive to the hospital<br> and execute your mother<br> on my way out of town.<br> - And don't pretend indifference.<br> - I can't do this.<br> - I can't.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Sure you can, man.<br> Come on. Hey. Hey.<br> Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna<br> end up getting other people killed.<br> Out of options, Max. Just take comfort<br> in knowing you never had a choice.<br> - How long you been doing this?<br> - Why?<br> Just in case they ask me.<br> - Private sector, six years.<br> - Okay. All right, six years.<br> You get benefits? Or, you know,<br> like, insurance? Pension?<br> No. No paid sick leave.<br> Quit stalling. Get out of the cab.<br> - Yeah? Hold up.<br> - Hold on, man.<br> Who is this?<br> Mark the time.<br> All right, it's cool.<br> - What's up, homes?<br> - Hey. What's up?<br> I'm here to see Felix.<br> He has something for me.<br> Don't know no Felix.<br> Tell him...<br> Vince... Say it's Vincent.<br> I'm Vincent.<br> Copy.<br> Let him in. Let him in right now.<br> Go ahead.<br> Detective Richard Weidner, L.A.P.D.,<br> Major Narcotics Division.<br> Detective Ray Fanning,<br> - L.A.P.D., Major Narcotics.<br> - Hi, okay. Agent Frank Pedrosa.<br> Good. Thanks for seeing us, Frank.<br> Yeah, you're welcome.<br> How can I help?<br> Why do you wanna know<br> about our case?<br> - Any unusual activity tonight?<br> - Like what?<br> That relates to a murder<br> or a series of murders<br> in Wilshire Central<br> or West Hollywood?<br> All quiet on the western front.<br> Various people are asleep.<br> Various people are not.<br> They come and go in cars,<br> pickups, taxis.<br> Other than that, we watch air move.<br> - Your interest in our case?<br> - Well, our interest...<br> We got a situation. Two bodies.<br> Could be a coincidence, could not be<br> a coincidence. It doesn't look like one.<br> - We got an attorney and his client...<br> - Roof's all beat to shit.<br> Roof's all beat to shit.<br> - Can you zoom in on this, please?<br> - On what?<br> On that.<br> - Look at that right there.<br> - What is it?<br> Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.<br> I thought you'd be taller.<br> So, Vincent...<br> - What are the two names?<br> - Ramone Ayala and Clarke.<br> Are you telling me Ramone Ayala<br> and Clarke were murdered tonight?<br> - Both killed?<br> - Sylvester Clarke for sure.<br> - Ramone, I don't know.<br> - I got another DOA.<br> Daniel Baker out of South Central,<br> Leimert Park.<br> That's three.<br> - Three what?<br> - Witnesses.<br> "Vincent meet their people<br> in Culiacn or Cartagena.<br> But he don't meet you." Okay.<br> Now you're here.<br> Why?<br> I lost my stuff.<br> The list.<br> I want you to listen to me real well.<br> Special groups put together<br> the list of dedos.<br> - Dedos?<br> - Fingers. Informants.<br> Signal interceptions with<br> voice-recognition software,<br> surveillance.<br> A very expensive counterintelligence<br> worked up that list.<br> An important list. Wouldn't you say?<br> And you lost it?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Sorry.<br> Sorry? Sorry does not put<br> Humpty Dumpty back together again.<br> - Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?<br> - No.<br> - Do you believe in Santa Claus?<br> - No.<br> Nor do I. Nor do I, but my children do.<br> They are still small.<br> But do you know who they like even<br> better than Santa Claus? His helper,<br> Pedro el Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.<br> There's an old Mexican tale<br> that tells of how Santa Claus<br> got so very busy looking out<br> for the good children<br> that he had to hire some help<br> to look out for the bad children.<br> So he hired Pedro.<br> And Santa Claus gave him a list<br> with all the names<br> of all the bad children.<br> And Pedro would come every night<br> to check them out.<br> And the people, the little kids<br> that were misbehaving,<br> that were not saying their prayers,<br> Pedro would leave a little toy donkey<br> on their windows.<br> A little burro.<br> And he would come back.
