Yeah.<br> - You'd go to Canada?<br> - No, not to Canada.<br> - You'd go back to 'Nam?<br> - Yeah, because...<br> - You would?<br> - You're a fucking psycho!<br> - No.<br> - You'd go back?<br> - Yeah. I went over for a purpose, man.<br> - What was your purpose?<br> - A lot of it was curiosity.<br> - But another thing was...<br> - You can't be curious, man.<br> I said that was just part of the reason.<br> The other was a moral obligation.<br> I feel that anybody... Not for their country<br> or anything like that. For anybody.<br> Nobody's got the right to tell anybody<br> what to do against their will.<br> That's what I went over to fight for.<br> Did you know that they ran the French<br> out of there after 20 years?<br> Wait a minute. You said they're forcing...?<br> Shit! You call the draft not being forced?<br> I ain't sayin' the draft in our country.<br> I'm talking about another country that's<br> having something forced upon them.<br> - Is it our duty to fight for somebody else?<br> - If you believe in it! If you believe in it.<br> I can't see anybody saying that,<br> after coming back, they would go again.<br> I just can't deal with that.<br> Wait a minute. The reason I can see it<br> is that some of us, not all of us,<br> some of us need to justify to ourselves<br> what the fuck we did there.<br> If we come back and say what we did<br> was a waste, some of us can't live with it.<br> - So they'd do it again?<br> - Man, they gotta keep...<br> Inside they're lying to themselves<br> continuously saying<br> "What I did was OK<br> because this is what I got from it, man."<br> "I have to justify being paralysed, I have to<br> justify killing people, so I say it was OK."<br> But how many guys<br> can make the reality and say<br> "What I did was wrong<br> and all this other shit was wrong, man"<br> and be able to live with themselves cos<br> they're crippled for the rest of their life?<br> ("Out of Time" by the Rolling Stones)<br> You don't know what's going on<br> You been away for far too long<br> You can't come back<br> and think you are still mine<br> You're out of touch, my baby<br> My poor discarded baby<br> I said, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> Well, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> I said, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> You are all left out<br> Out of there without a doubt<br> Cos baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> A girl who wants to run away<br> Discovers that she's had her day<br> It's no good you thinking<br> that you are still mine<br> You're out of touch, my baby<br> My poor unfaithful baby<br> I said, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> Well, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> I said, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> Yes, you're all left out<br> Out of there without a doubt<br> Cos baby, baby, baby, you're out of time<br> You thought you were a clever girl<br> Giving up your social whirl<br> But you can't come back<br> and be the first in line<br> Oh, no<br> You're obsolete, my baby<br> My poor old-fashioned baby<br> I said, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> Well, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> I said, baby, baby, baby,<br> you're out of time<br> Yes, you're all left out<br> Out of there without a doubt<br> Cos baby, baby, baby, you're out of time<br> Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time...<br> (PA) Re-box all weapons.<br> Place your weapons on the firing line<br> with the dust covers up.<br> Grease up the brass...<br> Word is it's turning into<br> a hell of a war over there, Captain.<br> We're going there, pal.<br> When we're in 'Nam, we're in Combat City.<br> I am ready. Really ready.<br> I'll pop some rounds with you. Marine!<br> - How's Vi taken to your leaving?<br> - I think she hates everything military.<br> But she stands behind me.<br> She knows I want it more than anything.<br> - How about Sally?<br> - She's OK.<br> I don't think she really understands it all,<br> but she accepts it.<br> You can't ask<br> for a helluva lot more than that.<br> (TV) An American spokesman reported<br> rockets, artillery and mortar fire...<br> - Jeez!<br> - Remember Jim Hanson?<br> He got blown away<br> in the middle of the street right in Saigon.<br> That's an embarrassment.<br> Makes us look like the goddamn B Team.<br> Word is from on top that Charlie<br> shot his wad with this Tet Offensive<br> and it's just a matter of a mop-up time.<br> I've waited a long time<br> for an opportunity like this.<br> You're gonna make major.<br> - Major?<br> - Major.<br> Major and Mrs Robert Hyde? I'll have<br> to get my skirts lengthened for that one.<br> Start wearing girdles.<br> - You'll have to watch your language.<br> - Right. Very reserved.<br> I'm actually excited.<br> I never thought it would get like this.<br> I have competitive nervousness.<br> I feel like I'm off to the Olympic Games.<br> Bob is very sexy.<br> In 13 months I'll throw you<br> the damnedest party.<br> We'll have a side of beef,<br> a case of Jack Daniels,<br> and maybe I'll even get you<br> a couple of congressmen.<br> Fantastic.<br> - I'll bring you back a souvenir.<br> - Like what?<br> A Commie AK-47.<br> - Robert? Sorry to interrupt.<br> - Mrs Vickery.<br> I wanted to pass on<br> the Colonel's best wishes.<br> - Isn't he able to come by later?<br> - No. Tonight's his chess night.<br> - Sally, be sure to keep in touch.<br> - I will, Mrs Vickery.<br> - She'll be staying with my mom.<br> - Oh, nice.<br> Earl, your Kathy's doing<br> a wonderful job on the paper.<br> - Don't let it go to your head, young lady.<br> - I've got a lot of good ideas.<br> Call me tomorrow.<br> - May God be with you, Robert.<br> - Thank you, Mrs Vickery.<br> ("Bookends" by Simon and Garfunkel)<br> That was very nice.<br> A time of innocence<br> A time of confidences<br> Long ago it must be<br> I have a photograph<br> Preserve your memories...<br> (Bob) Now hear this!<br> It is exactly zero hour minus six.<br> Your orders for the day are:<br> Go directly to the bedroom.<br> Do not pass "Go".<br> Do not collect dinner.<br> - Aren't you hungry?<br> - Well...<br> Does a bear make big potty in the woods?<br> From the Halls of Montezuma<br> to the shores of Tripoli...<br> I will fight...<br> my country's battles...<br> on land,<br> in the air...<br> (Bob grunts)<br> ("Hey Jude" by the Beatles)<br> (Bob sighs)<br> Bob?<br> What are you doing?<br> This darn thing wouldn't pop up.<br> You never know<br> when you're gonna want some toast.<br> I gotta start getting ready.<br> You don't need to be afraid<br> for me, you know.<br> I am afraid.<br> But I'm proud of you.<br> There was nothing I could do<br> here in California.<br> I know.<br> That's where I belong. And I am a Marine.<br> (PA announcement)<br> I gotta go. Pay the bar bill.<br> And let's get the generator<br> in this thing fixed.<br> And call my mom and let her know<br> when you're coming.<br> - I bought you a present, sweetheart.<br> - I don't have anything for you.<br> (Marines chant)<br> Oh, Sally. It's a little wedding ring.<br> Look how outstanding that is. Huh?<br> I like it.<br> - You'll probably take it off on liberty.<br> - No way.<br> I'll never take this off. That's a promise.<br> - This'll be my good-luck charm.<br> - That's right.<br> Sir? We're ready to move out.<br> Can I stow your gear?<br> - We're at war.<br> - Yo!<br> Let's go.<br> When I get back, we're gonna get us<br> a little condominium right on the beach.<br> Tell brother Billy to take care.<br> - And a garage filled up with Porsches.<br> - Be a good girl. No fooling around.<br> - Just come back.<br> - You got it.<br> Oh. This is Dink. My wife Sally.<br> Hello, Mrs Hyde. Vi, Captain Hyde's wife.<br> Hi, Vi.<br> Be careful.<br> - You have a spot on your tie.<br> - What?<br> (giggles)<br> Don't wear your skirts so short.<br> See you around.<br> - Hey, Vi?<br> - Yeah?<br> Do you want a drink?<br> Can I buy you a drink or something?<br> Where's open? No place is open.<br> - Just the Officers Club.<br> - Any place but there.<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> Well... that's that.<br> Hey. I live just a couple of miles down.<br> Wanna come over?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Stay close.<br> - Park in there. It's empty.<br> - OK.<br> Don't mind the mess. Come on up.<br> ("The Star-Spangled Banner" plays on TV)<br> Don't turn it off.<br> (TV white noise)<br> OK?<br> Yeah. Sorry. Just tonight especially,<br> I felt superstitious.<br> Whatever gets you through the night.<br> - I guess it's the way I was brought up.<br> - Me too. Is beer OK? It's all I got.<br> Oh, sure.<br> You gonna stay on in officers' quarters?<br> Are you kidding?<br> I couldn't even if I wanted to.<br> - That's spooky.<br> - Bob moves off and I've gotta move.<br> You're the hole in the doughnut, and<br> when the doughnut goes, there's no hole.<br> They say if the Marine Corps wanted you<br> to have a wife they'd have issued you one.<br> - Is that you?<br> - Me and my kid brother.<br> He's cute.<br> He inherited the brains,<br> the beauty, the personality, the talent.<br> Then he got drafted.<br> He's the main reason I hang out here.<br> - Not Dink?<br> - Dink the kink?<br> He's part of it. But the kid's<br> in the VA hospital - psycho ward.<br> They sent him home without an ignition.<br> So I'm stuck with him.<br> God. It must be really hard on you.<br> I see him every day.<br> I work in the hospital, in the kitchen.<br> Is he gonna get better?<br> Who knows? They don't.<br> I don't.<br> - Hey, Pee Wee.<br> - How are you doing, Mr Martin?<br> I'm just fine, Pee Wee. Just terrific.<br> I only stink a little bit.<br> - Smells like booze to me.<br> - I need a bath, man.<br> I just have two hands<br> and too many assholes to clean.<br> That's what you're being paid for.<br> Mr Martin, you get more from Uncle<br> for your disability<br> than me and my old lady get put together.<br> Maybe they shouldn't<br> put you together, then.<br> - Your radiator's blowing over.<br> - So's yours, Eddie.<br> I'm serious, man. You better watch it<br> before you pop your melon.<br> Oh, shit. I'm filled up. Where's Corinne?<br> (Pee Wee sniggers)<br> You better watch that booze.<br> Mess up your kidneys.<br> Watch where you're...! Goddamnit! Shit!<br> - Oh, shit!<br> - Oh, my God!<br> Would you please give me my canes?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Goddamnit!<br> Nurses, interns and orderlies!<br> Fucking nurses and fucking doctors!<br> They treat us like nobodies<br> in this fucking hospital!<br> - Goddamn it! Where are you people?<br> - (man) Give it hell, Luke.<br> Corinne, you're fucking late!<br> There's something on the floor for you!<br> You stay where you are, Digroot!<br> You come near me, I'll break<br> your fucking head! You understand?<br> Where the fuck were you? You're<br> so goddamned slow. Can't you move?<br> Come near me! I wanna hit you! I wanna<br> hit something that can't fucking move!<br> What am I saying?<br> What am I doing?<br> - Having a little problem today, Luke?<br> - Oh, shit!<br> Doctor, I can't even<br> get my piss bag changed!<br> - You want me out of this hospital?<br> - Give him 50 of Thorazine.<br> Take care of me and I'll get the fuck<br> out of here! Just take care of me!<br> Fucking hospital!

You're not used<br> to those hippy types, huh?<br> Bob would flip out<br> if he ever saw those characters.<br> That about does it, huh?<br> I feel like I've lived in base houses<br> all my life.<br> Should've had the government move us.<br> - They do that for officers, you know?<br> - Yeah?<br> I didn't realise that we'd accumulated<br> so much stuff.<br> Well, don't worry. My rates are cheap.<br> You know, I think I must have moved<br> at least 15 times since I left home.<br> I went back there once<br> when my old lady died.<br> Nothing's left. They tore down my past<br> and built a shopping centre.<br> - Want to see something funny?<br> - I'd love to.<br> My yearbook.<br> - Ooh! Look at that dress.<br> - It was a nice dress.<br> - It's cute.<br> - There's another one here.<br> So funny looking at<br> the way we used to look.<br> - Doggy in the window?<br> - Look.<br> "Sally Bender. Nickname: Sal."<br> "What is the one thing<br> she'd want on a desert island?"<br> "A husband."<br> - I was so ambitious.<br> - And so original.<br> You know that guy we were talking about?<br> He's in here somewhere.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Look.<br> "Luke Martin. Nickname: The Duke."<br> - He's cute.<br> - "Co-captain of the football team."<br> "What one thing would he want<br> on a desert island? A mirror."<br> - This is asinine, Pee Wee.<br> - There you go. Take some.<br> Don't you get the feeling<br> that this is kinda silly shit?<br> Shit, I'm not saying<br> this isn't entertaining, Pee Wee.<br> I'm not eating, Pee Wee. I'm not eating.<br> I'm not eating, Pee Wee. Come on, man.<br> Give me my arms. I can feed myself.<br> This is bullshit. I'm not a child, man.<br> Drink the milk.<br> - Hi there.<br> - Hello.<br> Juice and coffee!<br> Want some juice?<br> Excuse me. Do you want<br> some juice or coffee?<br> - Juice or coffee?<br> - Look at that round-eyed chick!<br> Come on, baby, light my fire.<br> - Wanna boom-boom? Short time?<br> - Like some juice?<br> I'm hard all over.<br> I'm a bargain in this ward.<br> Hey, man, be cool. I told you.<br> Get yourself together.<br> - Do you want some juice?<br> - Tits... ass... You got it all, Mama-san.<br> - You got it all.<br> - (man) Hey, you shut up.<br> Yes, sir. Right away.

Oh, man.<br> (knocking)<br> Luke?<br> Can I come in?<br> How are you doing?<br> - Do you remember me?<br> - No.<br> I was at Lincoln High<br> when you were there.<br> Sally Hyde. Well, I was Sally Bender<br> when... when I was there.<br> So?<br> I just started volunteering today here.<br> Terrific. If I could get my hands loose,<br> I'd salute you.<br> You're a mess.<br> - Sally Bender.<br> - Right.<br> - You were a cheerleader.<br> - That's right. Three years.<br> - Were you wounded in 'Nam?<br> - Right.<br> When did it happen?<br> A long time ago.<br> - My husband just went over there.<br> - Poor bastard.<br> Sally?<br> Didn't we used to call you Bender Over?<br> - What? Who said that?<br> - Bender Over. Everybody said it.<br> - They did not!<br> - Yes, they did, Sally.<br> Oh, come on. They did not.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Oh, shit.<br> Sally, listen.<br> Can I ask you for a big favour?<br> Sure.<br> How about unhitching me<br> from these things?<br> - No, I can't do that, Luke.<br> - Sure you can. It's easy.<br> No, I'm sorry. The doctor<br> has to do that. I...<br> Come on. Please? Please, Sally Bender.<br> - Come on.<br> - What are you doing in here?<br> - I just was seeing...<br> - We'll tend to Mr Martin, Sally.<br> - You're needed on the ward.<br> - OK.<br> Hey, Bender.<br> You almost got yourself a gold star.<br> Pee Wee, I can crawl again.<br> Morning.<br> I'm gonna be feeding you this morning.<br> I'm a new volunteer here.<br> Huh?<br> He ain't transistorised, honey.<br> You gotta plug him in for sound.<br> Plug you in? Oh.<br> Is this... is this gonna hurt?<br> There. Is that OK?<br> - Thank you.<br> - OK. Would you like some food?<br> Hey, there you go. Oh, my.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - That's OK.<br> You want me to...? Here.<br> Here. Here you go.<br> It's all energy. You understand?<br> You don't understand.<br> You give out energy, you get energy back.<br> You see me smiling?<br> Can you dig them pearly whites?<br> I smile my ass off now.<br> Hell, sometimes I think<br> I'm the Good Humor Man.<br> Everyone wants a piece of my action.<br> They think I'm one of the Beach Boys.<br> - Hey, Sally. This is my brother, Bill.<br> - Hi, Bill.<br> You see that? Me and her just had<br> a whole conversation in smile contact.<br> - Vi, do you have a jumper cable?<br> - Sure. Bridges!<br> Watch. You watching?<br> You two just did it. You smiled<br> "See what I have to put up with?"<br> And she smiled back "He's harmless."<br> - Are you on uppers?<br> - I don't know.<br> Come on, Bill.<br> How about a game of chess?<br> My brother -<br> a miracle of modern medicine.<br> Hey, wait. Oh, my God, what a day.<br> Is he usually like that?<br> ("White Rabbit" by Jefferson Airplane)<br> Try it!<br> (engine revs)<br> Is it charging?<br> (engine dies)<br> No.<br> (Vi) I like this one.<br> This is beautiful. It's a convertible.<br> I don't know how you'd keep warm.<br> Oh, it's got a great sound system.<br> Hello.<br> - Why is this one so much less expensive?<br> - It's two years older.<br> "I'm so tired when I come home at night,<br> I just fall right asleep."<br> "I know you didn't want me<br> to get a job..." Thanks.<br> "...but this isn't really a job, since<br> I don't get paid. I hope you don't mind."<br> Then there's sort of a sexy ending.<br> "Love, Sally."<br> - That's nice.<br> - Thanks.<br> But you didn't tell him the house<br> you rented was on the beach.<br> I know.<br> And you didn't tell him<br> about the new car you bought.<br> I figure I'm gonna save that<br> for when he gets home.<br> - I got one from Dink this morning.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> All he said was "Got you another ear."<br> Poetic, huh?<br> A captain? Shit, Bender. You didn't<br> go out and marry a fucking captain?<br> That's right. Why? What were you?<br> A sergeant.<br> Sergeants have a lot<br> of responsibility, don't they?<br> Yes. They sent me my stripes<br> on the hospital ship.<br> My reward for getting so fucked up!<br> Why are you so cynical about that, Luke?<br> What are you doing here, Bender?<br> Why aren't you on a golf course?<br> Doing something you're good at.<br> I'm just trying to keep busy.<br> Sure. Something<br> to talk about over martinis.<br> How you're helping out the poor cripples.<br> I don't think that<br> I deserve that, Luke - at all.<br> Maybe you're getting ready for your<br> husband to come back in a body bag.<br> Read someplace else!<br> Luke?<br> Luke.<br> Stop! Stop and listen to me!<br> What is the matter with you?<br> Why do you have to be such a bastard?<br> (gurney bangs)<br> Kevin. I thought<br> you died Wednesday, man.<br> You can get paralysed in a war<br> that don't even make sense<br> and come back and they don't have<br> the decency to ask you how you're doing.<br> "Can I do anything for you?"<br> I got a Purple Heart. I got it from a second<br> lieutenant that wasn't even in the war.<br> They don't tell you about<br> how to manage your finances.<br> Or going back into society. Half<br> the people still can't go back into society.<br> What about your sex life?<br> They don't tell you about that.<br> I went out the first time<br> and didn't know what to do.<br> What happens if my gizmo busts? What<br> happens if I have a bowel movement?<br> I get there and I don't know how to react.<br> There's not enough beds,<br> not enough staff.<br> It's really crowded.<br> The guys have to wait in line.<br> They're not prepared for the number<br> of wounded being sent back.<br> I don't think we're clear<br> on what you're asking us for, Sally.<br> It's what I said. We could do an article<br> in the paper, using these photographs,<br> interviewing some of the guys, maybe.<br> Isn't it difficult for the men<br> to be around women?<br> When I joined Weight Watchers<br> I didn't want candy in the house.<br> I don't think that's our function, Sally.<br> We're more a base gossip sheet.<br> Fun and games for the fellas.<br> I agree with you, Connie.<br> I'm sorry, Sally. I hope you understand.<br> What's next in the agenda?<br> We have the Little League play-offs<br> and the officer-son baseball game.<br> That's the 25th and the 27th, isn't it?<br> I just... I want to say<br> that I'm really shocked<br> that you'd rather write about<br> a goddamn home run than this hospital.<br> - Sally, please.<br> - What if they were your husbands?<br> (TV) That sure is a mindblower!<br> That's the way it was done 150 years ago.<br> - Things have improved.<br> - They certainly have.<br> Picture a young man 150 years ago<br> in the beautiful hills of Kentucky.<br> There's a girl he's crazy about.<br> She's lovely, vivacious...<br> (Luke) What's shaking, man?<br> One of them days, man.<br> Flashback to when I got fucked up.<br> Wow!<br> Get out of the way!<br> ("Just Like a Woman" by Bob Dylan)<br> Nobody feels any pain<br> Tonight as I stand inside the rain<br> Everybody knows<br> That baby's got new clothes...<br> He dedicated himself to justice and<br> love between his fellow human beings.<br> He gave his life for that principle<br> and I think it's up to those of us<br> who are here...<br> It was a choice between dealing with that<br> or dealing with this football game<br> and they just said it's not our function.<br> Maybe I'm naive.<br> Naive? She wants to know if she's naive!<br> - Oh, man. That's cold.<br> - I'm a cold man.<br> It's like you've done your duty,<br> served your purpose,<br> so they just toss you into the heap<br> like a used Kleenex.<br> That's the way it is. That's it.<br> What is our function if it isn't to deal with<br> the problems you guys face every day?<br> God! The smugness just...<br> I can't believe it.<br> - Give 'em hell, Bender.<br> - Sorry.<br> It's not gonna do any good,<br> but I'm rooting for you.<br> Well, thanks a lot, Luke.<br> Seriously, if they put<br> something in the paper...<br> You're beautiful when you're excited.<br> Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit<br> When we meet again<br> Introduced as friends<br> Please don't let on<br> that you knew me when<br> I was hungry and it was your world<br> Ah, you fake just like a woman...<br> God only knows<br> what he saw over there... or did.<br> I don't understand it.<br> He was only in 'Nam for two weeks.<br> I worry a lot about Dink too.<br> He's so funny, you know?<br> So uncomplicated.<br> He's more than just a roll in the sack.<br> I just hope he doesn't get totalled.<br> Whoo!<br> I got it.<br> - Bender!<br> - You got a chair!<br> - You changed your hair!<br> - You like it?<br> - Yeah. It's very nice.<br> - You're mobile.<br> - I'll help you. Go ahead.<br> - Thanks, Luke.<br> - Hi, Rick.<br> - Hey, Luke. How you doing?<br> Congratulations.<br> Would you like to come over for dinner?<br> Wouldn't you like to<br> get out of here one night?<br> I'm a good cook.<br> OK?<br> ("Jumping Jack Flash"<br> Watch it<br> I was born in a crossfire hurricane<br> And I howled at my ma<br> in the driving rain...<br> (whistle)<br> (cheerleading chant)<br> (whistle)<br> (player) I hit him after the whistle, man!<br> It was wrong! He grabbed my chair!<br> Didn't you grab my chair?<br> (whistle)<br> Can't you morons kick a field goal?<br> Come on! Field goal!<br> B-u-s-t! Bust 'em!<br> And around about July 1st,<br> my pa's mind would start wandering.<br> He wouldn't give a damn about the cattle,<br> and that got us kids pretty excited.<br> At the park they'd have flags flying<br> and games of chance,<br> kissing booths and wrestling matches.<br> But let me tell you,<br> that day was always too long for me.<br> When it got dark, the band<br> would play "The Star-Spangled Banner"<br> and the fireworks would start up,<br> and I'd start thinking how brave those<br> men were that fought in the Revolution.<br> I'd dream about those men,<br> how they went to war for our freedom.<br> I guess that's when I decided<br> to be a soldier,<br> seeing the sky lit up with those rockets.<br> I enlisted when I became of age.<br> I served in Europe and World War Two<br> and was involved in the liberation<br> of dozens of towns.<br> As I passed through them,<br> as I saw the faces of the people,<br> I realised I had fulfilled my dream.<br> I had become one of those men<br> who had gone to war for freedom.<br> I sure wound up doing<br> what I wanted to do,<br> and that's what July 4th means to me.<br> (some clapping)<br> (squeaking)<br> - I bet you can't do that.<br> - I can't do that. Can you do this?<br> (clicks tongue sharply)<br> - No.<br> - Go on, try it.<br> (clicks tongue softly)<br> I can't do it. (giggles)<br> (Vi) Hey, Billy the Kid. Let's show<br> these guys what real talent is. Come on.<br> Give me your arm. You know,<br> the duet we worked up last night.<br> (half-blowing, half-honking)<br> - Billy, you gonna play that thing?<br> - (Sally) Come on, Billy. Play your guitar.<br> (Vi) Come on. I love<br> when you play the guitar.<br> What is tomorrow? What is it we need?<br> What will it give us?<br> A new life we can lead<br> Will the wind crack the limbs<br> of a few dying trees?<br> Will the branches unite<br> and bend in the breeze?<br> Tomorrow is hope<br> for it is something I've not seen<br> Tomorrow is a sunny day...<br> live in a sunny dream...<br> Come on, Billy. That sounded great.<br> Shit.<br> I can't play my fucking guitar.<br> (crying)<br> God!<br> (Billy moans)<br> (Luke) It's all right, man.<br> It's gonna be all right.<br> I think it really helped him<br> having you there. I really do.<br> Luke, are you OK?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Should we do the dinner another night?<br> No. No.<br> I think you were really wonderful<br> with him. I really do.<br> (Luke) Oh, boy.<br> Just come down here<br> and hold the chair for me.<br> Thanks.<br> You could pick my ankles up.<br> Thank you. That's good. Thank you.<br> It's warm because I've had the oven on.<br> I've got one of those timing devices<br> that cooks your food while you're at work.<br> Whoo.<br> Let me just move you around a bit.<br> - You like margaritas?<br> - Yeah.<br> Well...<br> I just happen to have some.<br> Let me just...<br> Do you get a chance to go out very much?<br> - Do you go to people's homes?<br> - No, I don't.<br> Let's go in the living room.<br> I think you can make it. OK?<br> Let's see. Um...<br> Wait a minute. What am I doing?<br> - What?<br> - What am I lighting a fire for?<br> It's the old Girl Scout instinct.<br> Let's see. I've got a dip...<br> Sit down, Bender.<br> Sit down.<br> - Are you nervous?<br> - (laughs nervously)<br> Yes.<br> Why are you nervous?<br> This isn't "Have a Gimp Over<br> for Dinner" Night, is it?<br> You're not one of those weirdos?<br> No, I'm not, Luke.<br> I know you're not.<br> I'm just very happy to be here.<br> I'm glad you're here.<br> How about some music?<br> Well...<br> I don't think you're gonna<br> like my records very much.<br> You probably won't<br> like the way I dance either.<br> (both chuckle)<br> Well...<br> Do you know that when I dream,<br> I'm not in the chair?<br> I don't even have a chair in my dream.<br> I have legs.<br> When I was a kid, I used to jump<br> in my mother's kitchen<br> and touch the ceiling.<br> She used to get pissed off cos<br> I'd leave my handprints on the ceiling.<br> I still check the snow reports,<br> the conditions at Mammoth.<br> I'm still the same person, you know.<br> It's funny.<br> When people look at me, they see...<br> something else,<br> but they don't see who I am.<br> I think people have a real hard time<br> seeing who other people really are.<br> People don't see me like I really am.<br> People look at me, I think, and they see<br> "Oh, cheery Sally, the captain's wife."<br> Sometimes I feel like<br> I'm becoming what people see.<br> You know, I spend 95/<br> of my time at the hospital<br> thinking about making love with you.<br> I've never been unfaithful to my husband.<br> (Richie Havens) Do those who hear<br> think he's doing wrong?<br> While the church bell<br> tolls its one-note song<br> And the school bell<br> is tinkling to the throng<br> Come here where your ears cannot hear<br> And close your eyes, child...<br> - Don't wake him up.<br> - Hey.

Walk out<br> on my job? Walk out on my brother?<br> I just can't, Sally.<br> Yeah. I'm gonna miss you. So is Dink.<br> - I'll call you when I get back.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Give him a kiss from me.<br> - Right.<br> On the cheek!<br> (shouting)<br> Great shot. Great shot. My best pass.<br> Oh!
