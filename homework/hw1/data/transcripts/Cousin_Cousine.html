Do you hear me?<br> Don't leave me.<br> I beg you, come back, please.<br> Good to be in Paris again.<br> The last time was six years ago.<br> I live in the Sologne, in Vernou.<br> I'm here for a funeral.<br> My half-brother. His heart gave up.<br> Dad?<br> And Karine?<br> - She's getting sleep therapy.<br> Aren't you going in?<br> - No.<br> I'm staying with granddad.<br> Why aren't you going to church?<br> - I'm against it.<br> There's no room for<br> churches in a republic.<br> Even when your father married<br> in church, I stayed outside.<br> For you. The last time<br> you asked for a bear.<br> That was three years ago.<br> - Keep the suitcase as well.<br> I bought it to put the bear in.<br> The people are so sweet.<br> They loved him a lot.<br> Everybody loved him.<br> His boss sent a beautiful wreath.<br> This is my father.<br> He couldn't come to the wedding.<br> - You were suffering from sciatica.<br> I know what it is to be alone.<br> My wife died three years ago.<br> I still haven't recovered.<br> This is not a party.<br> I used to drive past here a lot.<br> I went to the swimming pool three<br> times a week. I loved swimming.<br> I continued going just after my marriage.<br> Then other things came up.<br> A pity.<br> We have to look for adventure every day.<br> If only for half an hour.<br> I'll be glad when it's over.<br> - Me too.<br> Singing really makes me happy.<br> I've had singing lessons for three years now.<br> What kind of songs?<br> - Anything. From Mozart to Gershwin.<br> Hum something for me.<br> - Not here.<br> Go on.<br> Quiet, mum's asleep.<br> It will do her good.<br> Stay, we can have lunch together.<br> Will you look after Eric? I'm in a hurry.<br> Let's go. Mum's tired.<br> - I'm hungry.<br> Come along then.<br> - No, she's eating at home.<br> Bye, see you soon.<br> Are you going to?<br> - I have an exam.<br> In three weeks, I'll be<br> at Jocelyne's wedding.<br> People used to take at least one<br> day off when one of their parents died.<br> Is that too much for a loved one?<br> Bunch of bastards.<br> We're in a hurry. A swimming suit<br> for her and trunks for me.<br> I could stay here for hours.<br> - Shall I call your work?<br> I'll tell them you're ill.<br> - I can do that myself.<br> They'll believe me. I never report sick.<br> And what about you?<br> I'll ask the caretaker to<br> hang a note on the door.<br> My students will come back tomorrow.<br> One day doesn't matter for dancing lessons.<br> I'm going for a swim and then we call them.<br> - Alright.<br> In the beginning, I lived close to<br> the Folies Bergre.<br> At night, I'd leave my door open,<br> hoping a girl would walk in.<br> But unfortunately...<br> Before I got married,<br> I was always in love.<br> When I'd see a guy I liked,<br> I wouldn't be able to sleep anymore.<br> He wasn't allowed to touch me,<br> but I also couldn't live without him.<br> I was so silly.<br> Next time, we bring towels.<br> It's incredible.<br> He creates sculptures from tires.<br> I'm talking with my mouth full.<br> He takes old tires and<br> creates a sculpture from them.<br> You should meet him.<br> That's the third person<br> you want to introduce to me.<br> I'm always like that with friends.<br> What a nice hat.<br> It would look good on you.<br> My husband hates it<br> when I wear a hat.<br> I'll give it to you as a present.<br> - Then I'll wear it when I go home.<br> The look on his face.<br> What does your wife hate?<br> Showy ties.<br> - Then I'll buy you an ugly tie.<br> Great. I'll wear it when I<br> visit her in the clinic.<br> We've had a nice day.<br> I'm happy.<br> It's after eight.<br> Pascal must be worried.<br> Good evening.<br> I didn't wait.<br> I have a meeting tonight.<br> Did you have to work overtime?<br> - No.<br> I didn't feel like working today.<br> I went swimming with Ludovic.<br> It was nice.<br> Then we went to the movies.<br> An old Laurel & Hardy movie.<br> - With Laurel & Hardy?<br> You're a character. Suddenly,<br> I don't see you anymore.<br> Come for a drink?<br> - Tonight?<br> Yes, now.<br> I'd really like that.<br> Come on, just follow me.<br> But why?<br> - Because I'm crazy about you.<br> That's it for today.<br> Till Monday.<br> Am I interrupting?<br> - I wanted to pick you up, but I was late.<br> I brought something to eat.<br> Why are your wife and you...<br> No idea. I never understood.<br> Maybe because I'm not jealous.<br> I respect other people's freedom.<br> Some people call that indifference.<br> What do you always do on Sundays?<br> Sometimes we go to the flea market.<br> My husband collects soldiers.<br> Generally, we go out for dinner.<br> He tries all the gastronomic restaurants.<br> And then he complains to<br> the Michelin guide.<br> What if we pretend we met<br> there by coincidence?<br> I'll call as soon as I know where we're going.<br> - My wife's coming home, by the way.<br> The more the merrier.<br> You're so sweet.<br> You treat me as if I was ill.<br> You're handsome.<br> You're really very handsome.<br> It's great.<br> Before my therapy I didn't see it.<br> What a nice tie you're wearing.<br> Your boss called<br> to ask how you are.<br> I sent him a resignation letter.<br> I don't want to design gardens anymore.<br> Nature can do what it wants.<br> Two years ago you wanted to work.<br> - Not anymore.<br> From now on, I'm dedicated to you.<br> By the way, there was an industrialist beside me.<br> He wanted to replace personnel. I told him<br> you're wasting your time with dancing lessons.<br> You should call him next week.<br> You can make a lot of money there.<br> Great.<br> On Sunday, we're having lunch<br> outside of the city.<br> In a good restaurant.<br> - I'd rather stay here, in bed, with you.<br> Ok then, if that's what you like.<br> What's wrong?<br> Are you in love? Tell me.<br> - No, I prefer suffering on my own.<br> Are you pregnant then?<br> - Idiot.<br> Look at Karine, for instance.<br> She's in great shape.<br> There's not enough pepper.<br> No, it's too late now.<br> Look who's coming in.<br> What a surprise.<br> - It certainly is.<br> Hello, cousin. Hello, cousin.<br> Do you want to sit there?<br> - Yes, please. Come, Nelsa.<br> Will you sit there?<br> - Are you on motorbike?<br> Nelsa has a moped.<br> - She leaves 15 minutes before we do.<br> Did you see Ludovic's bike?<br> You should buy one as well.<br> It's a terrible place.<br> Look at those people.<br> They're stuffing themselves, while the<br> rest of the world's hungry. Jerks.<br> If you start like this, I'm leaving.<br> You say something about it.<br> Everybody can say what they want.<br> What a beautiful day.<br> How do we continue now?<br> First we have to get on a first name basis.<br> - I find that difficult.<br> But I'll do my best.<br> Then we make a decision.<br> We'll have sex or not.<br> If we have sex and continue to<br> see each other, we'll have to lie.<br> You to your wife, me to Pascal.<br> It would be so common.<br> Or we have sex and<br> then say goodbye forever.<br> Then I'd rather not make love to you.<br> We keep going in the same way.<br> We see each other because we like to.<br> They'll be jealous.<br> - So what? We don't do anything wrong.<br> Years pass and we become<br> an amazing couple.<br> 'They've been together for 20 years but,<br> apparently, they don't sleep together.'<br> 'Really? '<br> - 'Yes.'<br> We're a special couple.<br> And we have to remain that.<br> We will remain that.<br> Aren't you ready yet?<br> We have to buy presents<br> for Jocelyne's wedding.<br> It's sweet that I can stay with Diane.<br> I can't stay home alone anymore.<br> Come, come.<br> - This time my life is over.<br> Oh well, I'll try<br> to be a good grandma.<br> I'll learn to make jam.<br> I need red shoes.<br> I found an old dress that looks<br> good on me and is back in fashion.<br> What time is the ceremony?<br> We have to get up.<br> You made me laugh so hard last night.<br> I haven't laughed like that for a long time.<br> I went to the doctor yesterday<br> and he said I'm in top shape.<br> I've never been in such good shape.<br> Good, let's get up.<br> - Alright, boss.<br> The trees are still blooming.<br> We're always the first to arrive.<br> I'm not drinking or eating,<br> because of my bladder.<br> Isn't that uncle Pascal?<br> What's going on?<br> - Why did you do that?<br> There's a pharmacy along the road.<br> He's bleeding.<br> - This is not the end of it.<br> He's an old business partner<br> of Pascal's who ran off with money.<br> He's the father of the bride.<br> Damn, my glasses.<br> Broken.<br> I built it all myself<br> and next year I'll expand.<br> I couldn't close today.<br> Saturdays are always the busiest.<br> I have pain everywhere.<br> It's caused by my spine.<br> Me too.

Look.<br> What do you mean 'yes'?<br> Are you mad? I have no scars.<br> Yes, but...<br> - You're nuts.<br> A glass of liqueur, sir?<br> Shall we leave<br> without saying goodbye?<br> Look, a leaf consists of three parts.<br> The leaf base.<br> The stalk or stem.<br> The blade with the veins.<br> The chlorophyll causes the assimilation.<br> An admirable woman.<br> She never did anything wrong.<br> Never says a wrong word.<br> I like to talk. I talk and talk,<br> but people don't listen.<br> Are you listening to me?<br> - It's all I do.<br> I know a funny guy not far<br> from here, who makes terrible souvenirs.<br> He makes the ugliest<br> souvenirs sold in France.<br> Do you want to meet him?<br> - Of course.<br> Don't you take pictures anymore?<br> - No, nobody understands them.<br> I want to be a rabbit.<br> - You'd look like a fool.<br> I want to be like the others.<br> Closed for no reason.<br> Come back tomorrow.<br> That's typical of him.<br> My father saved that money for me.<br> But you promised me trucks<br> and I'm still waiting.<br> I never received them, but that<br> has nothing to do with our project.<br> I'm glad they're making up.<br> That's enough.<br> - Let go of me.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Are you happy?<br> What time is it?<br> Ten to five.<br> Too early to go back.<br> They're not worried enough yet.<br> A year ago I wanted to die.<br> All I thought about was suicide.<br> But I didn't have the courage.<br> Did you want to die?<br> Why?<br> - I was depressed.<br> My work, my husband, my son.<br> Sometimes it's all so ridiculous.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> - Go ahead.<br> If you find me impertinent,<br> just don't answer.<br> Have you ever cheated on your husband?<br> - Yes.<br> With somebody from work.<br> He was funny.<br> It lasted two months.<br> That was the only time.<br> And have you cheated on your wife?<br> You'll be surprised, but never.<br> - Never?<br> Never.<br> I was waiting for you.<br> Pascal's drunk out of his mind.<br> Leave me alone.<br> Excuse me.<br> He's had a bottle of whisky.<br> I wanted to stop him and he hit me.<br> I'm a fish.

A couple of<br> days away will do me good.<br> While the female looks after the young,<br> the male goes looking for food.<br> The hours are long<br> during his absence.<br> The male returns with worms in<br> its beak and the young play with them.<br> Is their apartment bigger then ours?<br> How many square meters do we have?<br> - I don't know.<br> Marthe, how many square meters<br> is your apartment?<br> No idea.<br> Help me push the table aside.<br> I'm going to bed.<br> What do you blame society for?<br> - I don't know.<br> A lack of imagination.<br> The people accept anything.<br> One day, you'll marry.<br> I'd rather kill somebody.<br> Quietly plan a murder...<br> ...find a victim and think about<br> it for months and years...<br> That's no more absurd than working<br> every day. It's more fun, actually.<br> Are you crying?<br> - No, I'm not crying.<br> Do you want to go home?<br> We're going.<br> - As you wish.<br> That's funny. They call each other<br> by their first names.<br> Karine and I don't do that.<br> Last night the coin dropped.<br> What do you mean?<br> - You slept with her.<br> No, I didn't.<br> - You're lying.<br> Listen, darling. Don't you think...<br> ...that you...<br> Sorry, do what you like.<br> I was so happy during<br> sleep therapy.<br> I was awake for two hours a day.<br> Then I went back to sleep,<br> I'll be cheerful,<br> so you can be proud of me.<br> I decided not to bother<br> other people anymore.<br> You'll see. I can be funny.<br> Wasn't I funny a couple<br> of years ago?<br> Thanks to your father<br> I'm flourishing again.<br> This morning, I listened to<br> the news again, for the first time.<br> There was nothing interesting.<br> I'm going to bottle my wine.<br> We have at least 400 litres this year.<br> Imagine my father<br> marrying your mother.<br> When will we see each other?<br> - One of these days?<br> Maybe we shouldn't see<br> each other for a while.<br> I need to talk to you.<br> - I know what you're going to say.<br> Anyway...<br> They're convinced we're doing it.<br> We had agreed...<br> - It's a pity.<br> You're right.<br> Let's think about us.<br> It's Saturday tomorrow.<br> Ok, here, tomorrow at 11 o'clock. We'll<br> spend the afternoon together.<br> At 11 in the morning?<br> Excuse me. Do you know what time it is?<br> - What do you care?<br> It's 11.40.<br> My train stood still<br> for an hour.<br> Where are we going?<br> - No idea.<br> Do you want to eat something first?<br> - No, let's not.<br> I used to work with a dancing teacher<br> who took his girlfriends here.<br> Number twelve.<br> Number six.

I'm furious.<br> Everything alright?<br> Do you need anything?<br> I have to ask whether you want to stay.<br> - Absolutely.<br> Have a nice Sunday.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> That's for me.<br> How are you?<br> Fine.<br> Have a nice evening.<br> And you shut up.<br> One word and I'm gone.<br> I'm staying in bed.<br> - Eric is gone already and I have to go too.<br> I'm not coming out of this bed<br> and I'm not selling medications.<br> Are you sick?<br> - No, but I don't want to do anything.<br> Then stay here until you're fed up.<br> Hello, sir.<br> - Do I know you?<br> I'm Mrs Baudoin of the<br> Aveyronnais society in Paris.<br> You were at the first meetings.<br> - Yes, I remember.<br> Do you still visit our region often?<br> - During summer.

In the name of<br> the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<br> He's got a great voice.<br> Is it good?<br> Can I get your phone number?<br> You never know.<br> Let's unwrap the presents.<br> Are you coming?<br> Do it for the children.<br> We're coming.<br> Are we leaving quietly or not?<br> - We're not stooping to their level.<br> We'll say goodbye.<br> - Can you close it?<br> I'm a vampire.<br> Glad to see you like this. You said you<br> wanted to break Casanova's record.<br> How many do you have to go?<br> - I'm thirty short.<br> I was wrong again.<br> They're not here.<br> Can I make a call?
