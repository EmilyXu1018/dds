Yeah.<br> Yes.<br> Let's record this.<br> This is a work of art.<br> Absolutely a work of art.<br> Oh, yes, yes.<br> Slow down. Not so fast.<br> Slow down. Stop.<br> You couldn't wait for me?<br> You did the Jayne Mansfield crash|without me?<br> Oh, the dog.|The dog is brilliant.<br> I must have driven through something.<br> There's some blood on the car.<br> Here on the handle,|and on the wheel.<br> Also on the wheel well.<br> See?<br> If the police stop you again,|they may impound the car.<br> You're right, Ballard.|You're right.<br> There's an all-night car wash|by the airport service area.<br> Watch yourself.<br> Is there something here|that interests you?<br> This interests me.<br> I'd like to see if I can fit into a car|designed for a normal body.<br> Could you help me into it, please?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> Are these safe cars?<br> Yes, of course.|They're very safe.<br> I'm caught.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Fuck! This is bad.|This is really bad.<br> James, somebody named Vaughan.|You want it?<br> Hello. Ballard.<br> I need to see you.|I need to talk about the project.<br> Where are you?<br> I think you're making it too clean.<br> Medical tattoos|are supposed to be clean.<br> This is not a medical tattoo.|This is a prophetic tattoo.<br> And prophesies are ragged and dirty.<br> So, make it ragged and dirty.<br> Prophetic? Is this personal prophecy|or global prophecy?<br> There's no difference.<br> Let me see here.|Where is it?<br> There it is.<br> I want you to let her|give you this one.<br> Where do you think|that one should go?<br> I thought that was you up there.<br> My last lesson's next week.<br> James, my car is-<br> What?<br> Could it have been deliberate?<br> One of your suitors.<br> It was Vaughan.<br> The traffic.<br> Where is everyone?<br> They've all gone away.<br> I'd like to go back.<br> I'd like to register a claim|for the 1963 black Lincoln.<br> Is there a form I should fill out?<br> I can give you the forms now,|but you'll have to come back...<br> between 7:30 and 4:30|to register a claim.<br> What's your attachment|to that thing?<br> A close friend owned it.<br> It's gotta be a total write-off. I don't|see what you could possibly do with it.<br> Are you all right?<br> I don't know.<br> Are you hurt?<br> I think I'm all right.<br> I think I'm all right.<br> Maybe the next one, darling.<br> Maybe the next one.<br>
