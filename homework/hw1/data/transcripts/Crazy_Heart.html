Glad to be here.<br> There's the bandstand.<br> I'll speak to you later. Good to have you.<br> Makes my day. There's no smoking in the alley...<br> but you can sure finish that one.<br> I'll take a McClure's up, with<br> a beer back, darlin'.<br> $ 4.75.<br> - It's on the tab.<br> No tab.<br> I'm Bad Blake darlin'.<br> I'm the band.<br> Jimmy? Tab?<br> Mr. Blake.<br> We have a nice room<br> for you at the Starlight Inn ...<br> and of course your meals are covered...<br> but I'm afraid you can't<br> run a bar tab.<br> It's in the contract.<br> Mr. Greene, of Greene and Gold...<br> put that in himself.<br> -Did he.<br> Yes, sir.<br> If you and Jack have an agreement,<br> we're gonna have to stick to it.<br> Don't worry about it. How much?<br> $ 4.75.<br> Mr Blake, let me offer you all the free bowling you want.<br> Hold that, would you?<br> Hey Ben, Jack here.<br> Listen, I didn't want to tell you 'til you finished the swing...<br> but the label cut "So sweet so bad".<br> But that fucker's still selling.<br> It was slowing down a lot.<br> The chains don't want it any more.<br> Plus Tommy Sweet's got 9 albums out.<br> What about his new album?<br> I finish in two weeks. I can get right to it.<br> Tommy wants to know if you<br> have new material.<br> New material?<br> You know I don't.<br> Nothing wrong with the old stuff.<br> Tommy thinks he's leaning<br> too heavy on the old stuff.<br> He doesn't want people thinking<br> he's riding the gravy train.<br> That son of a bitch...<br> has a lifetime pass on the gravy train.<br> Hey Bad, who's asking who for a record?<br> Jack, you jerkoff, when you get your ass<br> to Clovis, New Mexico...<br> and play in a bar or a fucking bowling alley...<br> get up at 5am and drive 300 miles<br> with hemorrhoids so bad...<br> its feels like you got fire ants up your ass...<br> THEN you can tell me about the gravy train!<br> You and Mr. famous Tommy Sweet.<br> Both of you try that some time!<br> Why don't you sit down<br> and write some songs?<br> Keep talking, keep talking. Jesus God.<br> What's the matter, can't do it anymore?<br> I'm tired of listening to your griping and everything.<br> Jack.<br> You go out every night drinking...<br> Hey, hey, listen to me.<br> I'm 57 years old ...<br> and I'm broke.<br> I got $10 in my pocket.<br> I sent you money<br> when you were in Texas.<br> So spend it wisely, my friend.<br> Yeah, fuck you. Goodbye.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Mr. Blake?<br> I'll be god-damned, it really is you!<br> I can't believe it.<br> Bad Blake in my store.<br> I'm Bill Wilson,<br> I'm a big fan.<br> Here's your McClure's.<br> I try to keep track of<br> what the stars drink.<br> Hey, you know what, my wife, Beverly ...<br> is one of your big fans.<br> She'd die if she knew you were here.<br> We're going to the show tonight ...<br> and if you could sing "I Don't Know" for Beverly ...<br> You got it.<br> - It'd mean the world to her.<br> "I Don't Know" for Beverly.<br> You can count on it.<br> Come here.<br> I wanna be able to tell everyone<br> I bought Bad Blake a drink.<br> You're kidding.<br> - No.<br> Thank you.<br> "I Don't Know" for Beverly and Bill.<br> - Yes.<br> Ok. Hold on.<br> Hi Mr. Blake, I'm Tony.<br> "Tony and the Renegades",<br> your band for tonight.<br> Yes, of course.<br> We're setting up in the bowling alley ...<br> and were wondering what<br> time to start rehearsing.<br> As soon and as often as you can.<br> That's the secret.<br> Mr. Blake?<br> Sorry to bother you ...<br> but what time are you coming over?<br> I got some sheets here<br> if you can read music.<br> Chord charts if you can't.<br> Here. This CD's for you.<br> The whole kit. The playlist's in there.<br> Watch your hand.<br> I'll meet you there.<br> You guys go on<br> Mr. Blake, it would mean a lot to us<br> if you'd come over a little early ...<br> and go over some leads.<br> - Leads?<br> They're paying you more than me.<br> Maybe you could show us some of the<br> old stuff Bad Boys used to play.<br> You taught Tommy Sweet to play, right?<br> Listen to CD. Listen good, and uh...<br> go over those sheets.<br> I'll be there in about an hour ...<br> gonna grab some supper<br> - Thank you, Mr. Blake.<br> I didn't think you'd show.<br> Boy, I've played sick, drunk,<br> divorced and on the run...<br> Bad Blake hasn't missed a show<br> in his fucking life.<br> And now I'm playing a fucking bowling alley,<br> backed by a bunch of hippies.<br> You sure they ain't<br> paying you more than me?<br> Come on, showtime.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, please<br> welcome to The Spare Room ...<br> The wrangler of Love,<br> Mr. Bad Blake.<br> Go to C.<br> Now F.<br> Hey Mr. Blake ...<br> all right man?<br> Yeah, I'm good.<br> - We're back on.<br> It's great to be here in Pueblo<br> with you all tonight...<br> If I've learned anything, it's to<br> give you people what you want ...<br> otherwise you won't want it ever again.<br> Here's a song I hope<br> some of you will want.<br> It goes out especially to<br> my dear friends Bill and Beverly.<br> God bless you.<br> Here we go.<br> Thank you Pueblo, thank you.<br> Drive safely. God willing<br> we'll get together soon.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the star of the show ...<br> the legendary Bad Blake.<br> Good night.<br> That's very good.<br> Very good.<br> Been a long time since I played<br> with a good piano player.<br> Thanks, Mr. Blake,<br> that means the world to me.<br> I'm Wesley Barnes.<br> - Mighty fine, Wesley.<br> Worked before?<br> - When I was a kid.<br> I just do this for fun...<br> and a coupla extra dollars.<br> I finally found someone on the road<br> who really is good. It'll be a pleasure.<br> Can I ask a favor Mr. Blake?<br> Bad, buddy, Bad. What can I do for you?<br> I hate to impose,<br> especially since we just met ...<br> but I have a niece who's a writer...<br> Trying to be. She writes local,<br> here in Santa Fe.<br> It's not the New York Times or anything...<br> but she writes about music ...<br> and you would love to interview you.<br> I haven't done one for years, but yeah...<br> you send her around.<br> I'll be glad to help her out.<br> Great!<br> Shall we play a little?<br> - Yeah, we can play some.<br> Mr. Blake?<br> Who the hell are you?<br> I'm Jean Craddock Sun Scene...<br> I'm Wesley Barnes' niece.<br> I'm here for the interview.<br> I just had a shower,<br> and I'm having dinner.<br> Sorry, I'll come back.<br> When's a good time?<br> No, just wait outside.<br> Let me get my clothes on.<br> All right.<br> Jesus God.<br> Be right there!<br> - All right.<br> Come on in.<br> - Sorry, I should've called.<br> No pictures.<br> You want some steak, or...<br> potatoes?<br> - Maybe later.<br> Which?<br> - Pictures. Maybe on stage?<br> Oh, that'd all right.<br> - All right.<br> You don't want a roll or nothing? Sit on down.<br> - No, thank you.<br> All right.<br> Do you mind if I eat?<br> - No.<br> Tape recorder okay?<br> Go ahead.<br> You always dress for dinner?<br> So...<br> how did you learn music?<br> My daddy. He had this old...<br> Washburn steel string.<br> He couldn't play it.<br> So I picked it up and started<br> fooling with it. Guess that's how.<br> Right, and what were you listening to?<br> A bunch of people you've<br> probably never heard of...<br> Lou Lubella, Scottie, Emmet Miller ...<br> the Georgia Wildcats.<br> Ever heard of them?<br> No, I've never heard<br> the Georgia Wildcats.<br> No, I didn't figure you had.<br> How about Hank Williams, Gene<br> Autrey, Waylon and them boys?<br> Right, Lefty Frizzel.<br> Want a drink?<br> - No, thank you.<br> So you said ...<br> you feel like your music<br> is influenced by the Blues?<br> Sam Howes, Big Bill Broonzy...<br> - We all owe our existence to them Delta boys.<br> Ever want to do something else?<br> I played baseball. I was<br> pretty good, too...<br> but for a while there I couldn't<br> hit the curve ball.<br> I decided to stick with the guitar.<br> And stayed where I was supposed to.<br> How about you?<br> You always wanted to be a writer?<br> I didn't know what I wanted for a long time.<br> But now you do?<br> Now I know what I don't<br> want to do again.<br> Yeah, amen.<br> Are you married?<br> - I was.<br> One of those things you<br> don't want to do again?<br> Not unless it's right.<br> - How the hell do you know?<br> You tell me. You've been<br> married five times.<br> Jesus Christ! Four times! Come on!<br> You gonna make another album with Tommy Sweet?<br> Two things I don't wanna talk<br> about: multiple marriages and Tommy.<br> All right. What's your real name?<br> I'm Bad Blake.<br> I was born bad.<br> When I die, my tombstone will<br> have my real name on it.<br> Until then I'm just<br> gonna stay Bad.<br> That's a long time for people<br> to have to wait to find out.<br> Maybe, maybe not.<br> Are you a daddy?<br> Got any kids?<br> Sweetie, I'm going to have to<br> get going here.<br> All right.<br> Can you give another half an hour<br> after the show?<br> Let's see how it goes.<br> I appreciate you having to do your work.<br> I understand that, but let's see how it goes.<br> Okay, thanks.<br> So Wesley's your cousin?<br> - He's my uncle.<br> That boy sure can play the piano.<br> - All right, thank you.<br> Wesley!<br> You were wonderful.<br> You haven't lost anything.<br> - Why thank you.<br> I think you're better than you were.<br> I'm Ann.<br> Hi Ann.<br> - Hello.<br> I have loved country music<br> my whole life.<br> Really?<br> - Yup.<br> I even know the B-sides<br> of your albums.<br> Thet's better than me.<br> I was thinking if you aren't<br> doing anything after the show ...<br> we could get a late dinner...<br> or a cup of coffee.<br> I would, but I promised<br> a reporter an interview.<br> That's allright.<br> I know you're in town<br> for another night.<br> Another time would be fine.<br> Gotta get back to work.<br> Could you play "Get a hold on you"<br> for me?<br> I'd love to. Right now.<br> Thank you Santa Fe ...<br> We'll be here one more night.<br> This is for Ann.<br> So how did you..?<br> You played a Gospel song in a bar.<br> - I did.<br> How did you get away with that?<br> How did you know?<br> If you'd been doing this as long as me<br> you'd know those things. Here you go.<br> All right.<br> - Cheers.<br> What else do you wanna know?<br> - Records.<br> What's your favorite?<br> I would say "Falling and Flying".<br> It made me a lot of money.<br> It turned my life around.<br> You get tired of playing it?<br> I have to play it twice, three times<br> a night, but you know...<br> It's been too good to me.<br> I can't turn my back on it.<br> So in today's world ...<br> of artificial country music ...<br> Who's real country?<br> What?<br> Is that a stupid question?<br> Is Tommy Sweet real country?<br> He tries covering it up, but<br> I taught him country.<br> He won't admit it. He's gotta<br> compete what comes from Nashville ...<br> but yeah, he's real country.<br> How'd you meet him?<br> I don't wanna talk about Tommy.<br> - All right.<br> What do you wanna talk about?<br> I want to talk about how bad<br> you make this room look.<br> Never noticed what a dump it was<br> until you came in.<br> I haven't seen someone<br> blush in a long time.<br> I can't help it, my capillaries<br> are close to the skin.<br> Where are you from?<br> I'm from Enid, Oklahoma.<br> Of course you are.<br> What's the most important thing about you?<br> I have a son.<br> Buddy.<br> He's four.<br> He's with the babysitter.<br> I'm gonna go get him.<br> Thank you for talking to me.<br> Did you get what you need?<br> I can always use more.<br> Well, come to the show tomorrow.<br> We'll continue where we left off.<br> - All right.<br> Okay, then. Nightie night.<br> Hey Bad, I have great news.<br> Now I'm bustin' my ass on this..<br> so write it down.<br> Cancel Benson, Arizona on your itinerary.<br> You're into Phoenix, Arizona.<br> Sun Pavillion. 8 o'clock sharp.<br> How's that?<br> The Pavillion.<br> Hey, I called to tell you<br> you're out of the Red Bison lounge...<br> and opening a major show<br> in Phoenix.<br> Opening? Shit, I don't know...<br> Bad, cut the shit.<br> Where else are you gonna play<br> in front of twelve thousand people?<br> Opening for who?<br> You open for Tommy.<br> No, no.<br> No god-damn way.<br> I haven't convinced them<br> to do the record yet.../ i<br> but at least I got them to do this.<br> No, no. I'm not doing it, Jack.<br> I'm not opening for Tommy,<br> I'll open for someone else.<br> Who else are you gonna open for, Madonna?<br> Want me to call her?<br> The dream of every sideman is that<br> some day the front man ...<br> whose ass he's been staring at<br> for years will open for him.<br> I don't owe Tommy Sweet<br> a fucking thing.<br> We both know.<br> Tommy owes you big.<br> But we also both know<br> how much this is worth.<br> I'll call you back this afternoon.<br> There is no time Bad. Yes or no?<br> I need time to think about this. Come on!<br> No time. Yes or no?<br> Yes, goddamn it! Yes, yes, yes, fuck yes!<br> All right. Okay.<br> Jesus Christ, it's like pulling it out of you.<br> Now don't fuck it up.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> Can I actually go backstage and<br> meet Tommy and everything?<br> That's very funny, but I don't<br> have time for this shit. Goodbye.<br> See you later,<br> you fucking asshole.<br> Okay boys, let's wing this thing<br> and put on the style.<br> I'll give you what you want.<br> Where does that damn wind go?<br> Thank you Santa Fe!<br> Good night and God<br> love you all!<br> God, I'm sorry.<br> I was waiting on the sitter for my son.<br> You know hard it is to find a sitter<br> at one o'clock in the morning.<br> I get off work at one o'clock.<br> I know how hard it is...<br> to find everything.<br> I'm just glad you found me.<br> Who's watching your boy?<br> A friend.<br> She just got there.<br> Wanna drink?<br> - All right.<br> Follow me.<br> - Okay.<br> Do you still have questions?<br> Just a couple. So...<br> where do all those songs come from?<br> Life, unfortunately.<br> Is this really what you<br> wanna talk about?<br> No, I guess not.<br> For some reason I can't explain...<br> I keep feeling obliged to apologise<br> for this ugly room.<br> and for being less than you<br> probably imagined me to be.<br> Is this that famous Country charm?<br> I was never famous for charm.<br> It's not too late to start.<br> Do you want something else for your article?<br> Let me get my recorder.<br> Come here.<br> I'm opening for Tommy<br> in Phoenix tomorrow.<br> Bad Blake's hit the big time.<br> - That's great, right?<br> That's what my agent says.<br> Will you come with me?<br> You're kidding.<br> I'm serious. Come on.<br> I can't.<br> How about...<br> I come over this morning<br> and fix you and your boy...<br> some of my famous Bad Blake<br> biscuits?

Count 'em off, Johnny.<br> No, no.<br> Bear, Bear.<br> I need kick and snare. Turn down the damn<br> guitar, you're drowning out my lyrics.<br> The mix is good, man. You can't<br> hear what I hear.<br> You'd be surprised,<br> Set it the way I tell you...<br> and leave it.<br> The mix is just fine.<br> Trust me.<br> Bear, I'm an old man. I can get grumpy.<br> Humour me.<br> Damn sound man.<br> Fucking up the opening act<br> makes the headliner sound better.<br> That's his fucking job.<br> - You have half an hour, cowboy.<br> We're gonna be on this stage 'til<br> we get the mix the way I want it.<br> Set the mix the way I want it or<br> we'll rehearse right through Tommy's set.<br> Let's take it from the top of the bridge,<br> see how Bear does.<br> Now the guitars are sounding right.<br> Thank you Bear, much better.<br> Well, well.<br> Heard you might be here.<br> You son of a bitch. Sit down.<br> You always knew<br> the right thing to say<br> How the hell are you, Bad?<br> I'm worse.<br> - That's about right, I reckon.<br> You gave up on the Southern Comfort?<br> I still drink it on stage.<br> It's good for the throat.<br> So they tell me.<br> Too sweet for me.<br> I never liked it either.<br> But when you're one of Bad's boys...<br> you gotta be able to<br> put away the whiskey.<br> Sorry to interrupt.<br> Can I get an autograph, Tommy?<br> - Sure.<br> You're my favourite,<br> I've got all your records.<br> Thanks, but his is the autograph you need.<br> He's Bad Blake ...<br> Taught me everything I know.<br> - Cool.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll be at your show tonight,<br> maybe even San Diego.<br> I appreciate your support.<br> I was thinking, Bad, about<br> our tours together.<br> We had some good times.<br> I'm glad you agreed to do this, Bad.<br> Oh, God, you kidding?<br> I need the money.<br> If not for this, I'd be playing<br> some saloon in Benson, Arizona.<br> Remember the time we ...<br> broke down in the desert in West Texas?<br> Sat all day waiting<br> for that goddamn wrecker?<br> You and me, case of warm beer.<br> Those were the days.<br> Yeah, ain't remembering wonderful?<br> How's the tour?<br> Tiring.<br> How about yours?<br> - I'm out for a month.

I know.<br> You gave me my start, Bad.<br> Don't think I don't remember that.<br> But I got a life too.<br> - Yeah, well.<br> Those are the ugliest boots<br> I've ever seen in my life.<br> Did the salesman threaten to<br> shoot your dog?<br> Why aren't we doing another album?<br> Why won't you do it?<br> Hold up now, I never said I wouldn't.<br> The MZ doesn't think it's the<br> right thing to do, that's all.<br> I think it is.<br> - You may be right.<br> They want some solos first.<br> Then we do a duet.<br> You get first shot.<br> I already told them.<br> I need money now.<br> I'm 57 years old.<br> My career's going nowhere.<br> I need something to<br> get it jump-started.<br> They won't give me a damn solo album.<br> I need this, goddammit,<br> I really do.<br> I swear, Bad, I can't<br> get them to budge.<br> But there's a way to make some<br> money if you want to.<br> Enlighten me.<br> Songs.<br> I have no new material.<br> Everything I hear is crap.<br> Write me five new songs.

(?)<br> - Yeah?<br> Any of them eating biscuits?<br> - Yeah.<br> Is your mother there?<br> Hello.<br> - Hi there.<br> Bad.<br> Jean?<br> - Hi.<br> How was Phoenix?<br> You know.<br> How are you doing?<br> Where are you?<br> - I don't know. How hot is it?<br> Why? I mean what<br> are you doing?<br> Thinking about you.<br> Stop it.<br> - Are you thinking about me?<br> I'm finishing my article actually.<br> That's not what I meant.<br> I know.<br> I have a few days off<br> before I go to Houston ...<br> I thought about stopping by.<br> What do you say?<br> Jean?<br> You're not making this easy on me...<br> you want me to stop by or not?<br> Ok.<br> All right. I'll be by in about three or four hours.<br> See you in a little bit.<br> Bye.<br> - Bye now.<br> Hello Mr. Blake.<br> Just sit back. Relax.<br> Where am I?<br> - You're in Santa Fe ...<br> you have a broken ankle<br> and a concussion.<br> Just relax.<br> - My guitar.<br> In the closet with your clothes.<br> I gotta get outta here.<br> That's up to the doctor.<br> - Where is he?<br> I'll get the doctor for you.<br> Sit back. Relax.<br> We'll get the doctor.<br> I'll be honest with you, okay?<br> The problem isn't the ankle,<br> it'll heal clean.<br> The problem is your general condition...<br> or the extreme lack of it.<br> The kinds of stuff we're talking here,<br> emphysema, heart failure, cancer ...<br> and an extremely good chance of a stroke.<br> They will kill you.<br> Are you gonna talk to me?<br> - About what?<br> Let's not kid ourselves,<br> you're an alcoholic.<br> I'll take care of your leg, you do<br> something for your cholesterol ...<br> but you have to stop smoking<br> and drinking ...<br> and lose 25 pounds.<br> Okay, Mr. Blake?<br> If I'm half as good about being laid<br> up as I think I'm gonna be...<br> You need to hush now, seriously.<br> Why? Am I rambling?<br> Must be those blue pills.<br> Think I can get more of those?<br> - No.<br> You know that song?<br> Can't remember who did it.<br> - That's how it is with the good ones.<br> You're sure you've heard them before.<br> You wrote that?<br> - Yes, ma'am, just now.<br> This is so unfair.<br> - What?<br> Some people'd give ten years of their<br> life to be able to do that...<br> and it just pours out of you.<br> Are you mad at me?<br> Want me to go to a motel?<br> No.<br> What?<br> I don't want you to go.<br> - What then?<br> Well, you were writing a song in my bed.<br> So?<br> - So?<br> Every time I lie down and hear that<br> beautiful goddam song ...<br> you're gonna be out there running around,<br> not even remembering this day.<br> I can't ever forget.<br> - Hey, if I could walk I'd come to you. Come here.<br> Come here. Listen to me.<br> When I was at the hospital,<br> I thought about who to call.<br> Who really gives a damn about me?<br> And then I thought about who I wanted to see.<br> You hear me?<br> I won't forget about you.<br> I won't forget about this day.<br> I promise you.<br> Look at you.<br> What are you doing in Santa Fe?<br> You're not supposed to be there.<br> Visiting a friend.<br> Can you drive yet?<br> - Pretty soon.<br> I want you to get back out as soon as possible.<br> Jesus Christ. If you're sister was turning<br> $25 tricks you'd overbook her.<br> Very funny. Remind me to book<br> you into some comedy club.<br> Just so you know, I have a contract here<br> offering you $75,000.<br> It's an advance for an album<br> to be recorded at a future date.<br> Wait, wait a minute.<br> What offer?<br> Don't worry about who.<br> Plus another $20,000<br> for first refusal rights...<br> for all the songs you write or co-write...<br> in the next two years.<br> Holy shit.<br> - This will be your best year in the last seven.<br> And you know who's responsible?<br> Tommy Sweet.<br> So do me a favor. Ease up on him, will you pal?<br> Tommy?<br> - Yes, Tommy.<br> All right, I'll talk to you in Houston.<br> And don't marry your friend.<br> I'm not getting married.<br> Listen ... Full of shit. (?)<br> Wanna call him back and say<br> I'm not about to marry you?<br> You might wanna wait until I ask<br> before you turn me down.<br> I'll sleep on the fold-out.<br> It'll be too confusing for Buddy.<br> No, I 'll do that.<br> - No.<br> You need a bed.<br> It's all right, I want to.<br> I'll go get him.<br> He wants to draw on your cast.<br> Will you do something for me?<br> - You name it.<br> Don't drink in front of him.<br> No problem, here.<br> Bad!<br> Look at you, Bud!<br> - I can see the mountains!<br> I haven't felt like this ever!<br> This is insane! (?)<br> What a ride! Come here!<br> Wow! Was that fun?<br> - My God!<br> You gotta go up there,<br> it's like another world!<br> Kiss me.<br> Take that. Nasty gale. (?)<br> Pretty darn intense.<br> Is it always like that?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> You've been married a lot.<br> - Yeah, but I, you know, I didn't ...<br> I've got a 28-year-old son, Jeanie.<br> I haven't seen him since he was four.<br> Where is he?<br> - I dunno.<br> His mother, Mary Jo,<br> lives in Marfa, Texas.<br> I do not know what he looks like,<br> or what he does.<br> I never taught him to ride a bike<br> or watch him play baseball. None of that.<br> Why not?<br> - I dunno.<br> I wasn't there,<br> even when I was.<br> I couldn't live<br> if I lost Buddy.<br> That's the damndest part. I did.<br> I wanna get away<br> by ourselves this weekend.<br> What day is it today?<br> - Thursday.<br> I'm not coming back to this city. (?)<br> - In a while.

There's all kinds of<br> great stuff for kids...<br> All right, we'll see.<br> - that aquarium with a big fountain.<br> All right, we'll see.<br> "We'll see." That means no.<br> - No, it means "we'll see".<br> All right?<br> Lotta good stuff to write about in Houston.<br> And there's me.<br> - That's more than a visit.<br> A lot of the good stuff, too.<br> - Jesus.<br> I don't wanna hear it, darlin'.<br> I don't want it around Buddy,<br> that much I know.<br> I heard you the first time.<br> - It's like living with a rattlesnake.<br> Wait.<br> I can't see you.<br> Aydame, amigo. Basura, basura.<br> Aydame, vamos a limpiar, okay?<br> Then I'll teach you some words of English.<br> Hey, hey!<br> - Hey.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I've been looking for you.<br> Jesus, Bad. You look like shit, man.<br> - Yeah, I know...<br> it's all the toilets I have to play in.<br> - Yeah?<br> Good to see you.<br> Sorry about the wreck,<br> I heard about that.<br> Could've been worse.<br> - Yeah.<br> How's business?<br> - Business? What business?<br> Since you've been on the road, I tell you ...<br> it's crap.<br> - Yeah, well if you cleaned this joint ...<br> maybe you'd figure out how to<br> get this business running.<br> If I cleaned it up I might find<br> out that we're both broke.<br> I had to git rid of my bartender.<br> It's just me and old Jesus.<br> Shit.<br> - Yeah, just us.<br> So? How's the road?<br> - Not getting any shorter.<br> Makes coming back here look good.<br> I have a feeling, knowing you, that<br> something happened. Special.<br> Yeah, I met a woman in Santa Fe.<br> - Yeah? Doesn't surprise me.<br> She's a good one, real good.<br> - Yeah?<br> More? No, not any more.<br> That's it.<br> - Oh, you sumbitch.<br> So. Santa Fe's a long way from here, right?<br> It's a tough trip for a man who<br> has to work Saturday nights, right?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, but worth it.<br> - We'll get you back in shape singing.<br> I want you to meet somebody.<br> Oiga, Jesus. Come here.<br> I want you to meet a legend. Big Bad.<br> Hi there, what's your name?<br> - Juan.<br> Yeah, Juan.<br> - Juan.<br> Or Jesus. Whatever.<br> A good man.<br> Hello.<br> Hi.<br> Is this Steven Reynolds?<br> Yeah, who's calling?<br> Actually I'm on a bit of a hunting trip....<br> I'm trying to track down a Mary Jo Reynolds.<br> She lived in Nashville from 1980 to 1985.<br> Born in Lima, Ohio.<br> You wouldn't be related, would you?<br> She was my mother.<br> Hey buddy, I can't hear you.<br> Who is this?<br> Your father.<br> Who?<br> I'm Bad Blake.<br> I'm here in Houston.<br> I'm your father.<br> How are you?<br> What do you want?<br> I'm kinda shocked<br> to hear your voice.<br> You said "was".<br> Mary Jo's dead?<br> Two years, come October.<br> What happened?<br> Everything.<br> I'm sorry, Steven.<br> Yeah. Well listen, what do you want?<br> I want to see you.<br> I don't think so.<br> Will you think about it?<br> I'm sorry sir, I probably<br> won't be able to help you.<br> Wanna take down my number?<br> I got your number.<br> Well ...<br> Sleep on it, think about it, and ...<br> I really would like to talk.<br> Imagine that.<br> I made the cars go real fast.<br> And when the collide they go boom! (?)<br> Oh, you got the cars, huh?<br> I can make them go faster than<br> anybody, then they crash!<br> What he's trying to say is "thank you".<br> But you gotta stop sending him things.<br> He thinks you're Santa Claus.<br> I do think he's Santa Claus.<br> I want him to know I'm<br> thinking about him, darling.<br> Are you thinking about me?<br> Yes I am.<br> Are you all right?<br> I called my son last night, Jeanie.<br> And?<br> He wouldn't talk to me.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I don't blame him.<br> Jeanie ...<br> I'm not feeling well.<br> I'll have to call you back.<br> Bad?<br> Big Bad, where are you, boy?<br> No, not again.<br> We're going fishing, all right?<br> Let's go. You forget? Let's go.<br> Get dressed, I'm waiting on you.<br> Toss me another one of those<br> barley pops, would you?<br> Here you go.<br> I hate to admit it, but<br> this was a damn good idea.<br> I just sent what might be<br> my best song ever to Tommy.<br> To record?<br> - Yes.<br> It's one of those you hate to give up.<br> - Why'd you do it?<br> He's paying me awful good.<br> He's in LA now, recording it.<br> Well I hope he don't fuck it up.<br> He can't fuck it up. It's that good.<br> So your boy won't talk to you?<br> No..<br> I don't blame him. I was wrong.<br> I had no right to call him.<br> Wait. You were wrong 25 years ago,<br> and wrong since, but ...<br> you called him. Now you're not wrong.<br> You're right, he's wrong.<br> - I went 25 years without trying to find him.<br> He's right. Too little, too late.<br> - No.<br> It's never too late son, never too late.<br> You called him, it's done.<br> All right? It's complete.<br> Now you're on the right track.<br> Just keep going. He's your son.<br> He is all I got.<br> - Keep after him.<br> It's what you gotta do.<br> It reminds me of a song by Billy Joe Shaver.<br> "I'm gonna live forever. Gonna cross that river.<br> Gonna catch tomorrow now ."<br> Goes something like:<br> "Nobody here will ever find me...<br> but I'll always be around. Just like<br> the songs I leave behind me...<br> I'm going to live forever now."<br> And listen to this, now:<br> "You fathers and mothers,<br> be good to one another...<br> please try to raise your children right.<br> Don't let the darkness take them...<br> Don't make them feel forsaken, just<br> lead them safely to the light."<br> Hello.<br> - Hi.<br> Are you all right?<br> - Yeah, fine. Why?<br> You didn't sound all right yesterday.<br> Sounded like you were dying.<br> Must've been food poisoning or something.<br> Well I'm calling because I got 4 days off<br> at the end of this month...<br> And I thought we might come.<br> But now I'm not sure it's such a good idea.<br> What do you mean? It's a great idea.<br> Why would you say that?<br> Are you sure you're OK?<br> I'm worried about you.<br> Don't waste a minute<br> worrying about me.<br> There's nothing wrong a visit won't cure.<br> How's Buddy?<br> He's fine.<br> So? You gonna come?<br> Hey there - oh, you've got you car!<br> I think he's had it.<br> All right, Bud?<br> - He's eating in his sleep!<br> What do you think of these<br> big buildings, Bud?<br> Even Superman couldn't leap over these.<br> Right here is where Sam Houston and his boys<br> beat Santa Anna and his Mexicans.<br> If it wasn't for this spot,<br> we'd all be speaking Mexican.<br> That's where Texas got its start, right there.<br> Do you speak any Mexican, Buddy?<br> "Agua" and "adios."<br> That's pretty good!<br> Wow, Bud, what do you see there?<br> Where did he go?<br> I think there's a watch for that one there. (?)<br> Are you getting tired?<br> - He's got so much energy he wears me out.<br> Why not go back to that park and take a<br> load off? Let Bud and I fool around...<br> and we'll come back around noon<br> and take you out to lunch.<br> All right.<br> Okay, you have your wish in your head?<br> 'Cos here's the spot.<br> Here.<br> Pick one. Pick some, you<br> can have a bunch.<br> There you go, that's good.<br> Here's mine.<br> Can't see it.<br> Hey Bud, wanna go inside where it's cool?<br> Let's do that.<br> Come on.<br> Let's go in this place and wet our whistles<br> before we pop outta the ground.<br> Out of the ground? Like that guy on TV?<br> - What guy?<br> The one on TV<br> - Yeah, that guy. Come on.<br> Hi there.<br> How are you guys today?<br> - All right.<br> Take a load off there, Bud.<br> I'll take a McCure's, if you got it...<br> Make it a double.<br> Ginger ale for my pal here.<br> Also a double.<br> Mine on the rocks, please.<br> How about you?<br> Rocks.<br> Lookie here. Look at this.<br> You wanna go explore?<br> You can.<br> What did you get?<br> Wow, Bud, you're getting<br> all kinds of good stuff.<br> That's $12.50 altogether.<br> $12.50?<br> Jesus!<br> Does this music drive you crazy?<br> If I heard it, it probably would.<br> Bud, come on and get your ginger ale.<br> Buddy?<br> He's probably in the restroom.<br> Buddy!<br> Come on, Bud.<br> Did he come back out here?<br> - No.<br> Buddy!<br> What the hell?<br> Did you see a little boy come in here?<br> Bud?<br> No..<br> I lost my little boy.<br> He's got brown hair. Four years old<br> His name's Buddy.<br> Buddy? What was he wearing?<br> I don't remember.<br> - Okay, well, sir...<br> where did you last see him?<br> - In a bar.<br> A bar. Which bar, sir?<br> - Hell, I don't know.<br> It was a little dark bar.<br> - Okay.<br> All stations, we've got a lost boy...<br> four years old, brown hair. Name's Buddy.<br> Report back, please.<br> Thank you.<br> - Why don't you stay here with me?<br> No, I gotta go find him. He's lost...<br> he's from New Mexico. We're supposed<br> to be meeting his mother.<br> I understand you want to find him,<br> but I need you to stay here.<br> All the guys are looking for him.<br> All right, sir?<br> Sir, how much have you had to drink today?<br> I had a drink.<br> - A drink.<br> What difference does that make?<br> - You lost him, sir.<br> Yeah, I lost him.<br> I'm gonna go find him.<br> Bud!<br> Have you seen a little boy?<br> What's going on?<br> - They're gonna find him, hon.<br> Where's Buddy?<br> - They got all these guards looking for him.<br> What?<br> - No need to worry.<br> The guards are looking for him?<br> - I stopped just for a second.<br> You stopped for a drink?<br> Please don't touch me. Please<br> don't touch me. Excuse me...<br> hi, I'm the momma<br> of the boy who's lost.<br> I said, do not touch me!<br> Bud, come here baby.<br> -There's my Buddy boy.<br> You're gonna be fine. There's my Buddy boy.<br> Everything's gonna be fine.<br> Shut up.<br> - We just got our wires crossed.<br> You can't go now, you don't have a ticket.<br> I should've trusted my instincts. Every bone in my body<br> told me not to get on that plane.<br> Everything's gonna be okay, Jeanie.<br> - No.<br> Everything's not okay.
