I hate that!<br> Just to get on my nerves!<br> Welcome to PTI, boys and girls.<br> We begin today with the boxing world.<br> Adonis Johnson...<br> ...a little-known boxer<br> being trained by Rocky Balboa...<br> ...handed light heavyweight<br> title contender...<br> ...Leo Sporino a second-round TKO<br> defeat in Philadelphia last night.<br> An anonymous source confirmed<br> to ESPN that Johnson...<br> ...is the youngest biological son<br> of Apollo Creed.<br> Fact that was kept<br> under wraps because...<br> ...Johnson was the product<br> of Creed's infidelity.<br> The boxing world is excited to have<br> another Creed in the ring...<br> ...but, Wilbon, does knowledge of this<br> affair damage Apollo Creed's legacy?<br> Damage his legacy?<br> Let's go back for a second.<br> A little history on Apollo Creed.<br> I certainly have him right up there,<br> as maybe the best of all time.<br> End of discussion.<br> He slipped. He made a mistake,<br> like a lot of people.<br> This isn't gonna be the first,<br> particularly in the boxing world!<br> Yeah.<br> But I'm not gonna say<br> it's gonna kill his legacy!<br> I think it's an embarrassment...<br> ...and I think the family must have felt<br> this embarrassment...<br> ...because they kept it<br> under wraps for so long.<br> - But I really have one question.<br> - What?<br> Can the kid fight<br> as well as the old man?<br> That's a stretch.<br> I found us our next payday.<br> Check it out.<br> - Creed's son?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Are you kidding me?<br> - No.<br> He's got one fight under his belt.<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know.<br> But he's got Balboa in his corner.<br> No one cares about<br> Balboa anymore.<br> Kid's here because of a name alone.<br> You're gonna do it.<br> This guy doesn't even deserve a shot.<br> Listen to me.<br> This is not a negotiation, all right?<br> You're the idiot that ran around<br> Toxteth with a gun.<br> Do you remember that?<br> And you are the clown who couldn't<br> control himself at a weigh-in...<br> ...and lost us millions in the process.<br> Millions, okay? So look at it again.<br> - I don't wanna be remembered like this.<br> - I don't care how you're remembered.<br> I care about your kids having a roof<br> over their head when you're done.<br> Do you understand?<br> Hello?<br> It's Tommy Holiday.<br> I look after Ricky Conlan.<br> - Yeah, how you doing?<br> - Listen.<br> Is it true about the kid?<br> About the kid?<br> Think you and the kid have got<br> 30 minutes for a business meeting?<br> All right, I'll tell you what.<br> Yeah, if you can get over here, sure.<br> We'll talk with you, but it's gotta<br> be fast because we're training.<br> - I can be there. Couple of days.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'll be in touch.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, man.<br> Thanks for taking the time.<br> I'll be right to it.<br> My guy needs to fight<br> in the next six months...<br> ...and we've beaten everybody.<br> You want me to fight Conlan?<br> I think it would be<br> a very wise move.<br> You've been down in Mexico<br> doing pro fights?<br> I've got you as 15-0 down there.<br> And with the Sporino fight,<br> that makes you 16-0.<br> Now, nobody needs to know these fights<br> on some hole in the wall, do they?<br> You think I'm ready?<br> Donnie, this man came here<br> because he knows you're a sure thing.<br> - Right? It's a sure victory.<br> - That is not true.<br> Yeah, it is.<br> Okay, listen.<br> All right.<br> This could be my guy's last fight.<br> And I wanna make it count.<br> Now, on that note...<br> We would need you to change<br> your name to Creed. It's just a formality.<br> And what if I say no?<br> Well, then... there's no fight.<br> Without the name, there's no fight.<br> It's a non-starter.<br> Okay. Okay.<br> Why don't you both take a day,<br> talk about it...<br> ...and we'll see what you say, okay?<br> It's a good deal.<br> Can't do it.<br> Nah, it's not my name.<br> And plus, I wanna make it<br> on my own merit anyway.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> You got a funny way of showing it.<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> I mean, weren't Apollo and Rocky<br> like best friends?<br> It feels like you're trying to tap<br> into whatever it is he left behind.<br> I don't think that's anything<br> to be ashamed of, you know?<br> - What are you afraid of?<br> - What are you afraid of?<br> I don't know.<br> I mean this hearing shit<br> don't scare you?<br> I always knew it would<br> happen eventually...<br> ...so my plan has always just been...<br> ...to do what I love<br> for as long as I can.<br> I think that's all we ever do.<br> You know?<br> So, what are you afraid of?<br> I'm afraid of taking on the name<br> and losing.<br> They'll call me a fraud.<br> Fake Creed.<br> Why don't you think<br> about what's true?<br> You love to fight, right?<br> - Yeah, it makes you happy, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, and you are<br> Apollo Creed's son, right?<br> - Yes.<br> - So then use the name.<br> It's yours.<br> - Hey, Unc, you down there?<br> - Yeah.<br> I know you don't want me<br> to do this, right?<br> I can think of better<br> things to do, Donnie.<br> But if we did do it...<br> ...how we get it done?<br> Well...<br> He's taller than you.<br> He has a reach on you.<br> Definitely has a lot more<br> experience than you.<br> And he's faster than you are.<br> He's the champion.<br> And since he's the champion...<br> ...you gotta bring the fight to him,<br> like I did.<br> You gotta go to the body. Dig.<br> And in doing that...<br> ...you're in a very dangerous place<br> because you can get laid out.<br> It ain't easy for me<br> to be in your corner, kid.<br> I don't know if you're ready for it.<br> I don't know if I'm ready for it.<br> But I'll do what you wanna do.<br> If it was anybody else in my corner...<br> ...I wouldn't do it.<br> But I got you.<br> So make the call.<br> All right.<br> I'm fighting Ricky Conlan.<br> I'm fighting<br> "Pretty" Ricky Conlan!<br> - Don't work him too hard, Rock.<br> - Yeah.<br> He's still a puppy.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Close the distance. That's it.<br> Yeah. One, two.<br> Good.<br> Come on. Body, come here.<br> Yeah. Got a good hit.<br> Okay.<br> Come on.<br> Dig deep.<br> Body, body, body. Good.<br> You up to moving around?<br> Take a break.<br> Hey, Unc, you all right?<br> - I'm all right.<br> - You okay?<br> I'm all right. It's out.<br> - I'm all right.<br> - All right.<br> Just let me walk.<br> Just... I'm good.<br> - Sure?<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey. What's wrong with you?<br> I don't know. I don't know.<br> Come here.<br> Just let me walk.<br> No, we got to call someone<br> and get you to the doctor, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> - All right, come on.<br> - Off the rope. Come on, I got you.<br> - Easy.<br> Hey, Stitch!<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - No, no.

Cent'anni.<br> 100 years.<br> - I'm honored.<br> - Lucky me.<br> Keep working on that shovel hook.<br> Right, that's it.<br> Now, wanna throw the hook<br> on the same side.<br> So you come up on the right,<br> you throw on the right.<br> Very good.<br> A little more vicious than that,<br> little more power.<br> Overdo it.

Yeah?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> All right, thanks.<br> Mr. Balboa.<br> Thanks for coming in<br> on such short notice.<br> Well, we went through<br> your test results...<br> ...and your biopsy came back showing signs<br> of large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<br> What's that do?<br> Well, it's a form of cancer.<br> I know that sounds scary,<br> but the good news is we caught it early.<br> However, we will have<br> to remove the tumor...<br> ...in your lymph nodes<br> and start chemotherapy immediately.<br> My wife tried that.<br> Mr. Balboa, as far as<br> options for treatment...<br> ...this is the best plan of action.<br> No, I understand,<br> but my wife tried that...<br> ...and I don't think I wanna do it.<br> Didn't turn out so good.<br> But it's okay.<br> With treatment, you'll still have<br> a very good chance of recovery.<br> Without it...<br> - I'm okay with it, really.<br> - Well, at least take these.<br> It has information on your diagnosis<br> and options for treatment.<br> - We can start...<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Listen, I'd appreciate if you<br> wouldn't say nothing to nobody, okay?<br> Oh, man!

No.<br> If you don't jump on this quick,<br> you're gonna end up dying.<br> I know.<br> And you're all right with that?<br> I am.<br> Man, you sound crazy, man.<br> Give me the keys.<br> I'll take you to the hospital right now.<br> I'm not crazy at all.<br> If I could take<br> everything that was good...<br> ...and put it into a bowl or something...<br> ...and say, "Hey!

I'm Jim Lampley.<br> Here comes Ricky Conlan.<br> 100,000 on their feet<br> for what may conceivably be...<br> ...his fast walk to the ring<br> for a professional fight.<br> Max Kellerman, what chance<br> does the young American have?<br> He's got the name.<br> That's why he's here tonight.<br> Does he have the game?<br> He's Apollo Creed's son<br> he's got Rocky Balboa in his corner.<br> But all the legends in the world...<br> ...can't help him tonight<br> if he can't fight.<br> The question is can he fight?<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> welcome to Goodison Park...<br> ...here in Liverpool, England...<br> ...where tonight<br> this is the main event.<br> 12 rounds of boxing...<br> ...for the light heavyweight<br> championship of the world.<br> For the thousands in attendance<br> and the millions watching around the world...<br> ...ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...let's get ready to rumble!<br> In the red corner,<br> wearing the stars and stripes...<br> ...his professional record,<br> 16 fights, 16 victories...<br> ...the challenger...<br> ...Adonis "Hollywood" Creed!<br> And fighting out of the blue corner,<br> wearing black with blue...<br> ...with 36 fights...<br> ...28 KOs...<br> ...he's the light heavyweight champion<br> of the world...<br> ..."Pretty" Ricky Conlan!<br> Okay, let's go.<br> How you doing, lads?<br> You known what I expect of you both.<br> We talked about it in the locker rooms.<br> I want you protect yourselves...<br> No low blows, no silly business.<br> Keep it clean, will you?<br> Understand?<br> Touch gloves.<br> Nice shorts, boy.<br> Too bad your daddy ain't here<br> to fight in them.<br> You know what?<br> You're gonna close his big mouth, okay?<br> You know what to do.<br> One step, one punch,<br> one round at a time.<br> You got this.<br> Round one begins.<br> "Pretty" Ricky Conlan<br> in the black trunks...<br> ...and Adonis Creed in the red,<br> white and blue.<br> Conlan is significantly taller...<br> ...and thinks it will be easy<br> to use his jab...<br> ...to keep young Creed at bay.<br> You can see right away how much more<br> relaxed Conlan is. He's been there before.<br> Move your leg!<br> Keep your left up!<br> That kind of nervous energy<br> can wear you out as the fight goes on.<br> Hard left hook by Conlan.<br> Creed backs off.<br> It's not easy to just jump right into<br> the major leagues like this...<br> ...having never fought<br> an opponent like Conlan.<br> Of course, there aren't<br> many fighters like Conlan.<br> Creed trying to get close to Conlan,<br> against the ropes.<br> Conlan easily<br> puts distance between them again.<br> Confan fires a hard body punch,<br> hits him hard with a right cross...<br> ...and backs Creed into the ropes.<br> - Break!<br> Ref, come on!<br> Keep it clean!<br> And he gets a warning<br> from the referee.<br> Creed kinds woke him up<br> with that shot...<br> And Conlan really<br> made him pay for it.<br> Creed ready to let his hands go.<br> Creed misses and gets hit in return.<br> - Perfect uppercut on the inside.<br> - To the corner! One!<br> - Down goes Creed.<br> - Two!<br> - Three! Four!<br> - I'm good! I'm good!<br> - Five! Six!<br> - I'm good!<br> Shake it off!<br> But already a knockdown<br> for Ricky Conlan.<br> - Are you okay? Are you sure?<br> - I'm good!<br> Fight!<br> Conlan lands a shot after the bell,<br> and round one was all Ricky Conlan.<br> Real for you now, boy?<br> Real for you now?<br> - How's the eye?<br> - Little bloody.<br> All right, look. Don't get rattled.<br> - I'm gonna knock his ass out.<br> - Do it in the nest round. Don't wait.<br> You keep making mistakes like that...<br> ...we're gonna pick you up<br> with a vacuum cleaner, okay?<br> Adonis was lucky there wasn't<br> another 30 seconds in that round.<br> Come on, baby. What you doing?<br> Here's what I want you to do.<br> He's gonna jab and throw the right.<br> When he leaves it out there, drop<br> that right hook and smash him, okay?<br> Stay focused.<br> So round one was a forbidding<br> experience for young Adonis Creed.<br> And now, after a discussion<br> with Rocky Balboa between rounds...<br> ...here comes in for more.<br> Conlan showed his power witgh<br> the uppercut at the end of round one...<br> ...goes back to boxing<br> to begin the second.<br> Be first!<br> Keep the pressure on, Rick!<br> Logic says Cree needs to find a way<br> to got inside of Conlan's long arms...<br> ...and create pressure on the inside.<br> Come on!<br> So far, it's still<br> mostly Ricky Conlan.<br> Hard left hook for Conlan, uppercut.<br> - Keep your hands up!<br> - Drives Creed into the corner again.<br> Tie him up!<br> Creed wraps him up and pulls turn in<br> to stop the onslaught.<br> You the champ, right?<br> You the champ?<br> Show me. Come on!<br> There's a perfect<br> right-hand shot by Creed!<br> Yeah!<br> Yes!<br> Creed misses wildly,<br> and they are going toe-to-toe.<br> Rapidly becomming a phone booth fight!<br> Go! Go!<br> Trading punches, right hand, left hand!<br> Both guys landing!<br> This is unbelievable action!<br> Doubt hook! Come on!<br> Hard right hand by Creed.<br> - You bleed just like me!<br> - Go to your corners! Come on!<br> You bleed just like me!<br> Man! That ain't shit!<br> He loves it! If Conlan thought<br> he had a pushover, he knows better now!<br> - He bleed like me!<br> - You belong in here!<br> They don't know<br> what you've been through...<br> ...and they sure don't know<br> what we've been through.<br> I don't want you<br> trading blows with him.<br> I want you to protect yourself.<br> Keep your distance!<br> I'm gonna smash this Wto bits.<br> Now he knows you're for real.<br> You gottabelieve you can do it.<br> That was such a big round for Creed.<br> Not just on the scorecards but<br> psychologically going forward, Jim.<br> You woke up a sleeping giant.<br> He's gonna come after you<br> with everything he's got.<br> Adonis, looking more and more<br> confortabte against the champ...<br> ...seems to have found his rhythm.<br> Go finish him off.<br> - This has devolved into a slugfest!<br> - One punch at a time!<br> Come on, D!<br> Conlans trying to punish Creed<br> at short range.<br> Finnish him now!<br> Big combination to end<br> the third by Conlan...<br> ...and Creed does not know where he is,<br> walking to the wrong corner there.<br> His arm is long.<br> Because you're playing<br> his game, Donnie.<br> Be patient.<br> One step, one punch...<br> - One round at a time.<br> - There you.<br> One step...<br> ...one punch...<br> ...one round at a time.<br> Round five of a scheduled 12...<br> ...and already it's a far different fight<br> than most experts expected.<br> He's just a pretender.<br> He's lucky to be in the same ring<br> with you hitting him.<br> Remember that.<br> Adonis Creed has succeed in pressuring<br> Ricky Conlan and making him fight.<br> Creed has proven plenty in this fight<br> He's taken it, he's given it back.<br> But he does not<br> look like a match...<br> ...for the best pound-for-pound<br> fighter in the world.<br> You're going throgh hell out there...<br> ...but you're hurting him too.<br> I can see it in his eyes.<br> You're not as far behind as you think.<br> Shorten that jab,<br> shorten the distance...<br> ...get underneath him,<br> and you'll be able to rip him.<br> You gotta push him back.<br> Most critics didn't think<br> Creed could make it this far.<br> Donnie, step under!<br> Yes!<br> Come on, Ricky!<br> There are moments<br> when Creed is assertively taking over.<br> But there's a hard counter right,<br> drives Creed back into the corner.<br> Just when it appears<br> Creed might be taking control...<br> Conlan comes close<br> to knocking him down.<br> Use that pressure. You are the one<br> that's in the driving seat.<br> He's not used to this level, all right?<br> Get 'em on the rope!<br> Deep breath.<br> Boy's fast.<br> Hey! It's you against you.<br> - Me again me.<br> - That's right.<br> - He's just in your way.<br> - Got it.<br> Get in out of the way! Let's go!<br> Not only is young Adonis Creed...<br> ...still in the ring,<br> he may be in the fight.<br> Hard left hand by Creed.<br> Conlan was an overwhelmingly<br> heavy favorite...<br> ...pounding young Creed with right hands<br> as you saw right there.<br> Bring back everything<br> that's ever hurt you.<br> Al the pain you had inside,<br> everything that held you back.<br> Put it in both fists, and I want you<br> to drive it through his body...<br> ...and I promise you, his head will fall.<br> We're into the part of the fight where<br> all your instincts come into play.<br> Most experts expected that Conlan<br> would avoid trading shots with Creed...<br> ...but he's trading willingly.<br> Creed fires a hard body punch.<br> Conlan in trouble!<br> Hard left hand to the body.<br> The champ is in bad shape, Jim.<br> Creed realized he has a better chance of<br> hurting Conlan to the body than to the head!<br> - What an uppercut!<br> - No!<br> And Creed staggers back.<br> Body! Body!<br> To the body, trading shots!<br> Pawing with his jab,<br> Creed looks to land one big shot.<br> Move your legs!<br> Donnie, get up!<br> Get up, D!<br> Come on, baby.<br> Stitch!<br> Creed just got up<br> like a man possessed.<br> You okay? Look at me!<br> - He was out!<br> - Donnie!<br> Down but not out.<br> Conlan thinks he's celebrating<br> a knockout...<br> Get down!<br> He's getting up!<br> ...but the referee is dusting<br> Creed's gloves.<br> You're good.<br> Creed beats the count<br> and the action begins again.<br> That's the heart of a champion.<br> He has his daddy's heart,<br> I'll tell you that much.<br> Donnie, be ready!<br> More work to do for Conlan.<br> Body shot. Body dhot.<br> Trying to set Creed up one more time.<br> Tie him up, for Christ's sake!<br> Stitch has done a great job<br> over that right eye...<br> ...but now the left eye<br> looks like it's almost shut.<br> Closing up.<br> - Rock, is he okay?<br> - You have to go back to your...<br> Stay there, Bianca, it's okay.<br> I'm cool, man, I'm cool!<br> I'm good.<br> - You're good?<br> - Yeah, man, all right?<br> - You sure febout that?<br> - I am. I'm good.<br> He's taken a lot of punishment<br> to both the body and the head.<br> Left eye completely closed.<br> - I'm gonna stop this thing.<br> - No!<br> Let me see the eye.<br> Time! Doc, give him a look!<br> All right. Show me your eye.<br> Show me your eye, Adonis!<br> How many fingers?<br> How many fingers?<br> How many, Adonis?<br> Four.<br> And again.<br> Two.<br> Time in!<br> All right. Breathe through your mouth.<br> Deep breaths, kid, deep.<br> You are up on the cards, you're<br> winning this. You are gonna win this!<br> But just keep smart<br> and keep away from him.<br> He's going to sleep this time.<br> He's going out this round.<br> I should've stopped the fight<br> with your father.<br> I'm stopping this one now.<br> Don't, okay? Let me finish.<br> - I gotta prove it.<br> - Prove what?<br> I'm not a mistake.<br> Look at me.<br> I never got a chance to thank Apollo<br> for helping me out after Mickey died.<br> But it's nothing<br> compared to what you've done.<br> You taught me how to fight again...<br> ...and I'm gonna go home<br> and I'm gonna fight this thing.<br> Buit if I fight<br> I want you to fight, too.<br> I want you to go across this ring...<br> ...and knock that son of a bitch down.<br> Can you do it?<br> Say it.<br> I'm gonna knock that<br> son of a bitch down.<br> I know you are. You know why?<br> Because you're a Creed<br> and I love you, kid.<br> - I love you too.<br> - Go on.<br> All right baby, let's go.<br> Go get him, Donnie!<br> Round 12 begins.<br> Virtually no one outside of Adonis Creed's<br> family and group of friends...<br> ...would ever have expected to see him in a<br> 12th round against "Pretty" Ricky Conlan...<br> ...and trading shots as they come<br> to these last three minutes.<br> And there's a hard left hook upstairs.<br> Yeah!<br> Every time you wanna say<br> it's die beginning of the end...<br> ...the other guy comes through<br> with a shot you can't believe.<br> Hard right hand by Conlan.<br> Come on! Don't sit there!<br> They're trading shots<br> in the kind of back and forth action...<br> ...that most of us didn't expect to see.<br> Creed getting hit<br> with some hard shots...<br> ...but landing some of his own,<br> and Adonis is firing back!<br> Another pitched battle<br> between the two warriors.<br> Ricky, nail him!<br> Come on, kid!<br> Creed spins,<br> puts the champ in the corner!<br> Body!<br> Throwing body shots<br> like he's Rocky Balboa!<br> Going upstairs<br> like he's Apollo Creed.<br> Knock his ass out!<br> Closing seconds of the fight!<br> Ricky!<br> That's what I'm talking about!<br> Conlan is down!<br> That is the first time in his career<br> he's been on the canvas.<br> You cannot be saved by the bell<br> in the 12th and final round.<br> Ricky, get up!<br> Stay down!<br> Stay down!<br> Six!<br> - Dramatic count in Liverpool.<br> - Seven! Eight!<br> He must get up to preserve his chance<br> to win the fight.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm okay.<br> - Look at me!<br> - I'm all right!<br> - He's up!<br> - What?<br> The bell sounds, so Conlan<br> survives the 12th round!<br> What a finish!<br> If that round goes another 30 seconds,<br> we may have a new champion.<br> An unforgettable fight<br> on an unforgettable night!<br> He's no longer<br> just the namesake of...<br> ...Apollo Creed,<br> he's the living embodiment.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> a round of applause...<br> ...for these two warriors in the ring!<br> To the winner by split decision...<br> ...and still the undefeated<br> champion of the world...<br> You did great, kid.<br> ..."Pretty" Ricky Conlan!<br> Donnie, you were robbed.<br> If this fight had been<br> 10 seconds longer...<br> 10 seconds longer...<br> Creed.<br> You go and get it, chum.<br> You the future of this division.<br> You wear that name with pride.<br> Respect.<br> Congratulations, Adonis,<br> on a sensational effort.<br> I just wanna thank my mom.<br> She's at home. I love you.<br> Even though I know she's mad at me<br> for doing this.<br> Hopefully I made her proud.<br> You almost gave me a heart attack<br> but I'm proud of you.<br> I got my family right.<br> Without them none of this<br> would've been possible.<br> Rocky...<br> Apollo Creed's son...<br> ...looks at you and says family.<br> What does that mean to you?<br> It means I'm a lucky guy.<br> What can I say, right, kid?<br> He's a real fighter, and he's<br> helping me fight a new things...<br> ...so I appreciate it. I really do.<br> Adonis, I know you<br> never met your father.<br> But if he was here tonight,<br> what would you wanna say to him?<br> I'll just tell him I love him...<br> ...and I know he didn't leave me<br> on purpose.<br> And I'm proud to be a Creed.<br> Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations<br> on a sensational performance. Jim.<br> Creed! Creed! Creed!<br> Go on.<br> Talk to them. Go on!<br> This crowd is up on its feet.<br> No one wants to leave the arena.<br> Everyone in here knows<br> they've seen something special.<br> A fight they will never forget.<br> Ricky Conlan wins the fight.<br> Adonis Creed wins the night.<br> This is it?<br> Yeah.<br> I just wanna see<br> if I can get up these steps.<br> When's the first time you came here?<br> I was 12.<br> I think it's my favorite place.<br> When you get to the top...<br> ...you think you can fly.<br> Almost there.<br> You got this.<br> Come on, young man.<br> Just let me catch my breath.<br> Come on, no breaks.<br> We rest at the top.<br> Just a minute.<br> Nah, this is what you asked for, right?<br> Lets go. One step at a time.<br> Yeah.<br> Come on.<br> One step at a time.<br> Who told you that?<br> Some old guy.<br> You know I meant that for you,<br> not for me.<br> I think they added a few more steps.<br> I don't know.<br> Almost there.<br> I'm gonna take these last two.<br> One more step.<br> How you feeling?<br> Good.
