                        We're all very proud of<br> Judah Rosenthal's philanthropic efforts.<br> His endless hours of fundraising<br> for the hospital, the new medical centre,<br> ...and now the ophthalmology wing which,<br> ...until this year, had just been a dream.<br> But it's Judah Rosenthal, our friend,<br> that we most appreciate.<br> The husband, the father,<br> the golf companion.<br> - Naturally for a medical problem...<br> - You're blushing, darling.<br> ...weekends or holidays.<br> But you can also call Judah to find out<br> which is the best restaurant in Paris.<br> Or Athens.<br> Or which hotel to stay at in Moscow.<br> Or the best recording<br> of a particular Mozart symphony.<br> My father is so nervous<br> about having to get up and speak.<br> I knew he was nervous when you didn't<br> eat any of those cocktail weenies.<br> He was so courageous all week,<br> then suddenly, tonight, stage fright.<br> Really, Judah, you were fine<br> till you got home from work today.<br> - Any mail?<br> - It's exactly where I left it this morning.<br> I haven't had a free second all day.<br> If you're gonna take a shower, you better<br> do it, because I have to use it, too.<br> I dread making that speech tonight.<br> Dear Miriam Rosenthal.<br> I'm at the lowest point of my life<br> as I write you this letter.<br> I wish to cause no suffering<br> but, because I'm going through pure hell,<br> I ask if you can meet me one time.<br> Your husband and I<br> are more than intimate friends<br> and have been deeply in love<br> for over two years now.<br> This must be faced, as there are so many<br> ramifications and complications.<br> Many promises were made, etc.<br> I need an open exchange<br> with you to clear things.<br> For all three of us to go on,<br> the situation has got to be<br> confronted in some fashion.<br> Please contact me at this number.<br> I want what's best for everyone.<br> Dolores Paley.<br> That the new ophthalmology wing is now<br> a reality is not just a tribute to me,<br> but to a spirit of community, generosity,<br> of mutual caring<br> and answered prayers.<br> Now, it's funny I use the term "answered<br> prayers". You see, I'm a man of science.<br> I've always been a sceptic.<br> But I was raised quite religiously.<br> And while I challenged it, even as a child,<br> some of that feeling<br> must have stuck with me.<br> I remember my father telling me<br> "The eyes of God are on us always. "<br> The eyes of God.<br> What a phrase to a young boy.<br> I mean, what were God's eyes like?<br> Unimaginably penetrating,<br> intense eyes, I assumed.<br> And I wonder if it was just a coincidence...<br> ...that I made my specialty ophthalmology.<br> I'm so proud of you, Judah.<br> Sharon is. We all are.<br> Let's get one of<br> Miriam and Judah together.<br> - Why did you write that letter?<br> - You know why.<br> - You wanna destroy my life? My family?<br> - I want her to know what you're like.<br> It was lying on the table all day.<br> By a miracle, I got it first.<br> You told me over and over again<br> you'd leave Miriam.<br> - I didn't!<br> - You did!<br> - I gave up business opportunities.<br> - Pipe dreams.<br> - And other men wanted me.<br> - What do you want from me?<br> - You think this was easy?<br> - I want what you told me you wanted.<br> To be together. Otherwise<br> I don't know what I'll do.<br> I'll jump out the window, I swear!<br> You've been my whole life for two years.<br> I can't go back to the way things were.<br> I was at a low point when we met.<br> You changed that.<br> I never said I'd leave Miriam.<br> It's wishful thinking.<br> "There's no passion. It's boring. "<br> Those are your words.<br> Unless you were lying to me<br> or there's more to this that I don't know.<br> - Have you met someone else?<br> - What? Oh, come on.<br> - For God's sake, Dolores. Dolores...<br> - What?<br> Now, look. I've lived with her 25 years.<br> The roots are very deep.<br> I can't go on leading two lives.<br> Well, you're not doing her any favour by<br> pretending. I'm not gonna be without you.<br> I'm not gonna let this happen to me<br> without a fight. I wanna speak to Miriam.<br> - Dolores, nothing is happening. All right?<br> - No!<br> Yes! Now listen to me, please. Just<br> bear with me. We'll work something out.<br> Let me get my thoughts together.<br> Just don't do anything rash.<br> Dolores...<br> What?<br> It's gonna be OK.<br> Oh, God.<br> You were gonna throw me aside<br> like a squeezed lemon!<br> - Don't dramatise this!<br> - I've given you the best years of my life<br> and you were willing to go on and on.<br> Get out of here.<br> I know you for what you are.<br> I'm lucky I found you out.<br> Those are my clothes!<br> That was great, wasn't it?<br> With the tuxedos and the evening gowns.<br> - Great.<br> - It was wonderful to live like that.<br> This is awful. Let me see<br> if I can get a cab. You stay here.<br> - Wanna see a movie again tomorrow?<br> - Sure, Uncle Cliff.<br> Jesus.<br> Unless... Maybe we should make it<br> a museum day. You know?<br> I promised your father on his deathbed<br> I'd give you a well-rounded education.<br> We probably shouldn't go to the movies<br> every day, just once in a while.<br> Even though I'd love to. You know?<br> So while we wait for a cab,<br> I'll give you your lesson for today. OK?<br> Your lesson is this: Don't listen<br> to what your schoolteachers tell you.<br> Just see what they look like. That's how<br> you'll know what life is gonna be like.<br> You heard it here first. I think I see a cab.<br> If we run quickly, we can kick the crutch<br> from that old lady and get it.<br> - I'm back!<br> - Where were you?<br> You know. Just out and around.<br> - You took your niece to the movies again.<br> - I'm crazy about that kid. She's just great.<br> My brother's in town. He wants us<br> to join him for a dinner party tonight.<br> Jesus.<br> - Please. You gonna make another scene?<br> - I didn't last time.<br> You did. You were not nice<br> and your resentment showed.<br> I don't resent him. I told you that.<br> I think he's a pompous ass.<br> You don't see it cos you love him.<br> - What are you muttering?<br> - Nothing.<br> You are. You're running down Lester.<br> - Hey, I like your brother Ben.<br> - Sure. You're not jealous of Ben.<br> You think I'm jealous of Lester<br> cos he's a TV producer?<br> No, because he's a much-honoured,<br> highly respected multimillionaire.<br> - And he does what you'd like to be doing.<br> - I can't watch his stuff. It's sub-mental.<br> - He wants to talk to you about a job.<br> - I don't need a job.<br> I got honourable mention<br> at that festival in... in...<br> Cincinnati? The documentary film<br> festival? This is what you're clinging to?<br> Everybody got honourable mention<br> who showed up.<br> Boy, things have really<br> changed around here.<br> Wendy, Cliff, come here.<br> I want you to meet Lisa.<br> My sister Wendy.<br> My brother-in-law Clifford.<br> Lisa Crosley.<br> She's starring in my new series.<br> - Not really starring.<br> - You're one of the stars.<br> It's an ensemble.<br> Tell 'em who you're playing.<br> - Hello, Lester.<br> - Hi, darling. So glad you came.<br> Thank you for inviting me.<br> It's a beautiful party.<br> Thank you. Why don't you have a drink?<br> Be right there.<br> She gave a bundle<br> to the Museum of Broadcasting.<br> She plays a...<br> A lawyer for the ACLU, with a husband<br> who writes for a conservative magazine.<br> - It gives us a chance to get into issues.<br> - We'll try to be fair but, knowing Lester,<br> - it'll be heavily slanted to the left.<br> - Let's hope so.<br> - You know we're gonna shoot it here?<br> - You'll be here? I couldn't be happier.<br> Me, too. I love this town.<br> Out there it's such a Mickey Mouse<br> environment. I'm not interested.<br> - That's why I'm in this week.<br> - Hello, Lester.<br> I wanna talk to you. Don't go away.<br> A bunch of us are getting together<br> to build major studio space<br> for production right here in the city.<br> In fact... I'm sorry.<br> Just give me one second.<br> Idea for series:<br> A wealthy builder always trying to realise<br> grandiose dreams a la Donald Trump.<br> - To be shot in New York.<br> - Look who's here.<br> This is my brother Ben.<br> Ben. Carol. Come here.<br> Hi, Cliff.<br> - How are your eyes?<br> - Not so good. It's not so optimistic.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - I've been seeing Dr Rosenthal.<br> Lester, I'm sorry. Don't you<br> want to talk to Clifford?<br> Yeah. Step into my office.<br> - Hi. I'm Lisa.<br> - Hi. We didn't meet. I'm sorry.<br> So, are you in TV, too?<br> No. No, I'm a rabbi.<br> You don't have to wear<br> an outfit or anything?<br> Public television wants<br> to do a documentary on me.<br> Follow me around,<br> the way I talk, the way I think.<br> It's part of their Creative Mind series.<br> So... I told them about you.<br> Thank you. But I'm workin'<br> on a thing of my own. A little film.<br> Yeah, Wendy told me. A film about some<br> philosophy professor, which is admirable.<br> But I'm offering you the chance to earn<br> decent money and reach a big audience.<br> The last thing you need<br> is for me to be your biographer.<br> I make these little films<br> on toxic waste and starving children...<br> Look, I'll be frank with you.<br> You're not my first choice.<br> I'm doing this for Wendy. She says<br> you haven't worked in a long time.<br> I've worked. It's just that<br> nobody's paying me.<br> Look, I know you don't respect what I do.<br> But I've got a closet full of Emmys.<br> OK, you think that's bullshit. Fine.<br> I understand.<br> I don't know. Maybe I could<br> use the money to finish my movie.<br> I do have some debts and things.<br> Idea for farce:<br> A poor loser agrees to do<br> the story of a great man's life<br> and in the process<br> comes to learn deep values.<br> - What are you doing in Boston?<br> - I'm lecturing at a symposium.<br> Incidentally, my name's Dolores.<br> - Hello, Dolores.<br> - Hello.<br> - Pretty name.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Do you go to Boston often?<br> - Not very often, no.<br> - I don't know anyone in Boston, actually.<br> - Really?<br> - Good morning.<br> - Hi. Miss Paley called. Said it was urgent.<br> Why did you phone me?<br> I told you I'd call you.<br> I couldn't help it.<br> I was going out of my skin.<br> I have to see you later. I have to.<br> OK.<br> After work is OK.<br> I see it.<br> Yeah. I see it.<br> Oh, God.<br> What?<br> I need to take a minute.<br> What's wrong, Judah?<br> I'm in such trouble, Ben.<br> What is it?<br> I need to talk to someone.<br> Sure.<br> We've known each other many years.<br> You're a religious man. OK, I'm not.<br> We've differed on many points,<br> but you're somebody I do respect.<br> - May I confide in you?<br> - Of course.<br> Go ahead. Everything's confidential.<br> I've done a foolish thing.<br> Senseless, vain, dumb.<br> Another woman.<br> Maybe I was flattered, vulnerable.<br> Maybe because she was<br> helpless and alone.<br> Now my life's about to go up in smoke.<br> - Can't you break it off?<br> - The woman won't allow it.<br> She's young. She's very unstable.<br> She's an hysteric.<br> And vindictive.<br> And it's my fault.<br> I instigated it. I prolonged it.<br> Many times I tried to back off<br> but I was too weak.<br> But I promised her nothing.<br> Or did I?<br> See, I don't even know any more.<br> In the heat of passion, you say things.<br> But, after two years of<br> shameful deceit in this double life,<br> I awakened as if from a dream<br> and realised what I'd be losing.<br> It's called wisdom.<br> It comes to some suddenly.<br> We realise the difference between<br> what's real and deep and lasting<br> versus the superficial<br> payoff of the moment.<br> You know, I kidded myself about<br> loving her but deep down I knew.<br> And knowing, I behaved selfishly.<br> For pleasure, for adventure, for lust.<br> Sometimes, when there's real love<br> and true acknowledgement of a mistake,<br> there can be forgiveness, too.<br> I know Miriam.<br> Her values, her feelings. Our place<br> among our friends and colleagues.<br> But what choice do you have<br> if the woman is going to tell her?<br> You have to confess the wrong<br> and hope for understanding.<br> Maybe Miriam was responsible<br> in some ways, too.<br> You have to discuss it<br> and hope for the best.<br> Maybe you can never<br> go back to the old life,<br> but maybe there's a new one with<br> maturity and understanding. Maybe...<br> Maybe even a richer one.<br> You know what's funny?<br> Our entire adult lives,<br> you and I have been having this same<br> conversation in one form or another.<br> It's a fundamental difference<br> in the way we view the world.<br> You see it as harsh and<br> empty of values and pitiless,<br> and I couldn't go on living<br> if I didn't feel with all my heart<br> a moral structure with real meaning and<br> forgiveness,<br> and some kind of higher power.<br> Otherwise there's no basis<br> to know how to live.<br> And I know you well enough to know that<br> the spark of that notion is inside you, too.<br> Now you're talkin' to me<br> like your congregation.<br> It's true. We went from a small infidelity<br> to the meaning of existence.<br> Miriam won't think two years of scheming<br> and dishonesty is a... is a small infidelity.<br> How can you do it? I give up.<br> God, you're in such wonderful shape.<br> - For a man my age?<br> - For any age.<br> - I was quite athletic as a young student.<br> - You still make love like a young student.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Yeah.<br> You know, I don't think<br> we should do this here.<br> - Why not? We're all alone.<br> - I don't know. I feel a little self<br> -conscious.<br> Let's go back to the cottage and light<br> a fire. You can play me the Schumann.<br> Schubert. Schumann is flowery.<br> Schubert is...<br> He reminds me of you. The sad one.<br> Schubert. God, you have to teach me all<br> that. I'm so ignorant in classical music.<br> I'll teach you.<br> Someday we'll have a lot of time.<br> Would you like a drink?<br> Yeah. Fix me whatever you're having.<br> Why'd you call the house last night<br> and hang up, Del?<br> I'm not playing games, Judah.<br> Just because you've decided we're<br> through doesn't mean I'll roll over and die.<br> What the hell happened to us? I mean...<br> We had a wonderful few years.<br> We both knew it couldn't go on for ever.<br> - I gave up things for you.<br> - Come on. That's poppycock.<br> Don't give me that, will ya?<br> For God's sakes.<br> There were no business opportunities.<br> It's all in your head.<br> No lovers beggin' for your hand.<br> I prevented nothing. I...<br> Can we not argue? I just wanted to talk.<br> I'm just so rattled.<br> I had an idea.<br> I thought if we could get away, just<br> for a little while, on one of our trips.<br> Our trips are<br> the warmest memories I have.<br> Not just in our relationship, but<br> some of the loveliest times I've ever had.<br> You're always so much more relaxed<br> away from home.<br> You come to life.<br> Your whole face changes.<br> I thought if we could just get away<br> to Boston or Washington,<br> - just without any preconceived notions.<br> - I can't go away, Del.<br> - Just a weekend.<br> - I can't, Del.<br> - Why not?<br> - I can't.<br> - You won't.<br> - Of course I won't. Right.<br> Why not?<br> Because you're very unrealistic.<br> You know that?<br> Sit... Sit down for a second. Let's talk.<br> Look. I've been...<br> I've been thinking, too.<br> And it occurs to me,<br> if I caused you to miss any opportunities<br> that might have been lucrative for you,<br> I'm perfectly prepared to reimburse you.<br> - I don't want to feel I've cost you any...<br> - I'm not after your goddamn money.<br> I want to speak to Miriam.<br> It's her problem, too.<br> - I want her to know the truth.<br> - Keep her out of it. All right?<br> I think she should know<br> her husband is a liar and an embezzler.<br> Don't you dare call me an embezzler.<br> I'm not blind. I know what went on with<br> those philanthropies and your stocks.<br> I took nothing. Not a nickel.<br> My conscience is completely clear.<br> You needed money<br> to cover your losses. I was there.<br> OK, OK. I needed some temporary help.<br> I mean, for Christ's sake.<br> After a life of hard work, a man doesn't<br> let himself go down the toilet. Does he?<br> And moving funds is not stealing.<br> Without telling anyone?<br> Every cent was accounted for,<br> with interest.<br> I don't think they would see it that way.<br> So this is what you plan on doing? You're<br> gonna hold on to me with threats, right?<br> Stupid threats and slander.<br> This is your idea of love, right?<br> I will not be tossed out.<br> I want to speak to Miriam.<br> Think, for Christ's sake! Think what<br> the hell you're doing to me. Please.<br> I can't figure it out.<br> I need you.<br> Del...<br> I love New York.<br> I was born in that building.<br> Behind the guy... the statue there.<br> The guy on the pedestal.<br> I love New York. It's like thousands of<br> straight lines just lookin' for a punch line.<br> And what makes New York<br> such a funny place is that<br> there's so much tension and pain<br> and misery and craziness here.<br> And that's the first part of comedy.<br> But you gotta get some distance from it.<br> The thing to remember about comedy is:<br> If it bends, it's funny.<br> If it breaks, it's not funny.<br> So you gotta get back from the pain.<br> See what I mean?<br> They asked me up at Harvard, a bunch<br> of kids asked me "What's comedy?"<br> So I said... And this is part of<br> what I said about getting back from it.<br> I said "Comedy is tragedy plus time. "<br> Tragedy plus time.<br> The night Lincoln was shot, you couldn't<br> make a joke about it. You just couldn't.<br> Now, time has gone by,<br> and now it's fair game.<br> See what I mean? It's tragedy plus time.<br> - OK, we're out.<br> - That's it? So fast?<br> I shot up ten rolls on your first question.<br> I've gotta get to CBS anyway.<br> We'll start this again tomorrow.<br> Just remember what I was saying.<br> What do you think?<br> - Excellent. Absolutely.<br> - I think I'm too cute.<br> I'll be more relaxed tomorrow.<br> I'll do that tragedy stuff.<br> - This is Halley Reed for Mr Kurnitz.<br> - Would you excuse me one second?<br> Listen, if you play your cards right,<br> you could have my body.<br> - Wouldn't you rather leave it to science?<br> - I offer you my heart, you squash it.<br> Come on. When are you gonna quit<br> this organisation, come work for me?<br> - You'd fire me. I'm much too opinionated.<br> - No, no.<br> - That's OK. I'll wait.<br> - I like mental stimulation.<br> - You tried shock therapy?<br> - That's good. That's funny.<br> - Listen, Lester. We've gotta go.<br> - OK. I'll be right with you.<br> - It's five o'clock.<br> - Wait in the car.<br> - Would you please come?<br> - Yes. Wait in the car, Arthur.<br> Yes, I was holding for Mr Kurnitz,<br> please. It's Halley Reed.<br> Why don't you come with me<br> down to Barbados?<br> We'll swim, we'll get some sun.<br> Sorry. I freckle.<br> That's my best shot. I can't do any better.<br> - That's OK. I'll wait.<br> - Think about it. OK? Please.<br> Talk to you tomorrow.<br> Yeah, it's Halley Reed. You cut me off.<br> - OK.<br> - Excuse me. We haven't officially met.<br> - I'm Halley Reed, an associate producer.<br> - I'm Clifford Stern.<br> Can I ask you what I asked the producer?<br> What do you bother with this guy for?<br> He's such a pompous bore,<br> and your show does such great profiles.<br> Just between you and me,<br> I wanted to do Gabriel Garcia Marquez.<br> - That's perfect.<br> - They like a little variety.<br> - He is an American phenomenon.<br> - Yeah, but so is acid rain.<br> Boy, you really don't like him, do you?<br> I love him like a brother -<br> David Greenglass.<br> So why are you doing this? It's unusual<br> for them to bring in an outside person.<br> Yes, I know. I'm doing it<br> strictly for the money.<br> I'm trying to make my own documentary.<br> I'm doing a profile on a guy who'd be<br> absolutely perfect for your show.<br> - Yeah? Who's that?<br> - His name is Louis Levy.<br> Do you have a little time?<br> The unique thing that happened<br> to the early Israelites<br> was that they conceived a God that cares.<br> He cares but, at the same time,<br> he also demands<br> that you behave morally.<br> But here comes the paradox.<br> What's one of the first things<br> that that God asks?<br> That God asks Abraham<br> to sacrifice his only son,<br> his beloved son, to him.<br> In other words,<br> in spite of millennia of efforts,<br> we have not succeeded to create<br> a really ...<br> ...and entirely loving image of God.<br> This was beyond our capacity to imagine.<br> - Boy, he's really interesting.<br> - A fascinating guy.<br> - He could be wonderful for the series.<br> - You wanna dump Lester and do him?<br> - Cos I would love to...<br> - We can't dump Lester.<br> But I think I could talk them into<br> a little financing for you.<br> And if all this comes together right,<br> and it should,<br> we got some free spots<br> in the fall schedule.<br> Wonderful. For me to get on your series<br> would be such a feather in my cap.<br> That would be<br> the biggest audience I ever had.<br> Great. Let's work on it.<br> Let's make it happen.<br> Really? You know, even though we just<br> met, I've taken an instant liking to you.<br> And I to him.<br> Hi. I thought I'd come by<br> on my way home. I got Jenny a present.<br> - Is that you, Uncle Cliff?<br> - Yes, Jenny. I got you something.<br> I got you a great book,<br> an absolutely terrific book.<br> How are you? I got you this great book<br> with great pictures of old New York in it.<br> - Look at this. This is old Fifth Avenue.<br> - This is great.<br> Carriages and top hats. I told you.<br> There's a section on speakeasies,<br> which is really interesting.<br> That's the Flatiron Building,<br> which is very famous.<br> I'm in a great mood.<br> I had a creative breakthrough.<br> I heard you got some action<br> on your ad in the personals.<br> - This is the old Madison Square Garden.<br> - Jen... Don't you have some homework?<br> - Yeah, I have to go do that.<br> - We'll look at this later. Great pictures.<br> Cliff...<br> What's the matter?<br> - I'm a wreck.<br> - What is it?<br> - I'm a wreck.<br> - Barbara...<br> Barbara, what's the matter?<br> I feel sick.<br> - What is it?<br> - I've been shaking like this for days.<br> What's wrong?<br> I've been going out with this man<br> that I met through the personal columns.<br> Very attractive.<br> It was very nice.<br> I went out with him three times.<br> He was never fresh.<br> He was always a perfect gentleman.<br> So... we both came back here,<br> and Jenny was away.<br> She was sleeping over<br> at a friend's house.<br> And it was, like, one o'clock<br> in the morning or something<br> and we both had had a little to drink.<br> You know, I wanna tie you to the bed.<br> - Really?<br> - And rip your dress off.<br> Have you ever been bound up,<br> tied up and made love to?<br> I'm... I'm a...<br> I'm a sensible gal.<br> No more you're not.<br> God, Murray. God...<br> Barbara, I'm shocked at what I'm hearing.<br> You're my sister.<br> A nice, middle-class mother.<br> What are you telling me?<br> I couldn't move.<br> I was tied tightly to the bedposts.<br> Jesus. By a stra...<br> a guy that you didn't know?<br> And now you're gonna tell me<br> that he robbed you, right?<br> No.<br> He got on top of me and... and...<br> - And what?<br> - I can't say it. I just... I can't say it.<br> What? Tell me. What's so terrible?<br> He sat over me...<br> and went to the bathroom.<br> That's so disgusting!<br> Oh, my God! That's the worst thing<br> I ever heard in my life.<br> - Then he took his clothes and left.<br> - Barbara! You idiot!<br> This guy could've cut your throat!<br> Murdered you!<br> - I would've preferred it.<br> - Jesus. You're such a dope!<br> I wish I could have sympathy for this.<br> That's so easy for you to say,<br> but I'm so lonely.<br> You don't know what it's like<br> to be by yourself all the time.<br> I'm sure you're lonely. I know it's painful.<br> But promise me that you're never gonna<br> place another ad again. It's ridiculous!<br> My whole life is passing me by,<br> and I don't have anyone to love.<br> I know that's so hard for you<br> to comprehend because you're married.<br> But it's so lonely out there.<br> I mean, you have a wife,<br> and you love her, and that's so nice.<br> Let me tell you. Things are not so good<br> between my wife and myself,<br> just so you don't get any illusions.<br> We've been coming apart for the last year.<br> It's just that neither of us has the energy<br> to do anything about it. It's not so great.<br> A strange man defecated on my sister.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> Is there any reason I could give you<br> that would answer that satisfactorily?<br> You know, it's just so...<br> Human sexuality is just...<br> it's so mysterious.<br> Which I guess is... you know.<br> I guess it's good in a way.<br> Yeah, well, I gotta be up at seven.<br> I knew it had to be some deep,<br> dark secret for you to stoop to call me,<br> - to actually invite me to your home.<br> - Jack, who should I turn to but a brother?<br> - I've been there for you.<br> - I'm here, aren't I?<br> Don't make sharp cracks. I didn't<br> stoop to call you. I'm in serious trouble.<br> She won't take money.<br> She won't listen to reason.<br> I even thought of telling everything to<br> Miriam, but she could never live with it.<br> Add to that her blabbing<br> about my financial indiscretions.<br> Not that I stole, but I was indiscreet.<br> And, if they look hard enough,<br> who knows what they'll find?<br> - What would you like me to do?<br> - I don't know, but she's killing me.<br> Want me to have somebody talk to her?<br> - Like what?<br> - Straighten her out.<br> What do you mean? Threaten her?<br> That's all I need.<br> How else do you expect<br> to keep her quiet?<br> I don't know. Jack, I don't know.<br> - Well...<br> - Christ, Jack. What are you suggesting?<br> What did you call me for?<br> I don't know. I hoped you'd have<br> more experience with something like this.<br> You called because you need some dirty<br> work done. That's all you ever call for.<br> Look how bitter you are.<br> You've staked me plenty of times.<br> I don't forget my obligations.<br> Threatening will only make it worse, Jack.<br> OK. Forget about it.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> How the hell can I forget about it?<br> I'm fighting for my life.<br> This woman's gonna destroy<br> everything I've built.<br> That's what I'm saying. If she won't listen<br> to reason, then you go on to the next step.<br> Threats? Violence?<br> What are we talking about here?<br> She can be gotten rid of. I know people.<br> Money'll buy whatever's necessary.<br> I won't even comment on that.<br> That's mind-boggling.<br> What did you want me to do<br> when you called me?<br> Not to do dirty work,<br> despite what you think.<br> Anyway, it's gone beyond<br> just Miriam now.<br> She's talking financial doings.<br> I'm out of ideas. I don't know what I<br> expected from you, Jack, but some help.<br> You know, you're not aware of<br> what goes on in this world.<br> You sit up here with your four acres and<br> your country club and your rich friends.<br> - Out there in the real world,<br> it's different. - Come on.<br> - I've met a lot of characters...<br> - I've heard these stories before.<br> ...from Seventh Avenue, from Atlantic City.<br> And I'm not so high-class that<br> I can avoid looking at reality.<br> I can't afford to be aloof.<br> You come to me with a hell of a problem,<br> and then you get high-handed on me.<br> I don't mean to be high-handed.<br> I haven't been sleeping. I'm irritable.<br> OK. Forget I said anything.<br> Let me just get something straight here.<br> Am I understanding you right?<br> Are you suggesting getting rid of her?<br> You won't be involved.<br> But I'll need some cash.<br> What will they do?<br> What'll they do? They'll handle it.<br> I can't believe I'm talking about<br> a human being. She's not an insect.<br> You don't just step on her.<br> I know. Playing hardball<br> was never your game.<br> You never liked to get your hands dirty.<br> But, apparently, this woman is for real,<br> and this thing isn't just gonna go away.<br> I can't do it.<br> I can't think that way.<br> Don't tell me.<br> I don't wanna know anything about it.<br> This is a work of art.<br> The ropes come off. I tie sash weights<br> to her ankles with soft catgut.<br> - Please! That's a horrible word.<br> - Get the angle on this.<br> She disappears. Two weeks, maybe three.<br> Then up she pops. None of this stuff<br> on her any more, no marks. A suicide.<br> - Now isn't that beautiful?<br> - It's loathsome.<br> - Be sure no one sees you.<br> - Don't worry.<br> This only happens in the movies.<br> Listen, we should get back.<br> Lester's gonna be leaving the hotel soon.<br> We'll make it. We've been shooting Lester<br> all week. I'm tired of it. We'll catch him.<br> I shouldn't have told you my weakness<br> is going to the movies in the daytime.<br> I go all the time with my niece.<br> It's wonderful. It's like playing hooky.<br> You said that yesterday and we were late.<br> We weren't late. We didn't miss anything.<br> Have another cheeseburger.<br> It's our lunch hour.<br> I've got everyone up at the network<br> very excited over Professor Levy.<br> I have some great stuff to show you later.<br> Listen.<br> I bought you a present.<br> Great. Now I can get rid of<br> my few remaining teeth.<br> # Happy birthday to you<br> # Happy birthday to you<br> A treadmill. Are you trying<br> to tell me something?<br> - You said you were bored with the bike.<br> - You may find this just as boring.<br> - I think you're in great shape already.<br> - Yeah, for a man my age.<br> Great to see you enjoying yourself.<br> You've been so depressed.<br> This thing's great for tension.<br> - I'll go get it.<br> - It's just like the one you saw at the club.<br> - Where are we gonna put this?<br> - I'm gonna have 20 men take it upstairs.<br> - It looks like a kinetic sculpture.<br> - It's not gonna stay down here.<br> - It tells you how many calories...<br> - Dad, it's for you.<br> Miss Paley.<br> - She's a patient.<br> - On this phone?<br> Yeah. She's going through a crisis.<br> I'll be right back.<br> - Why couldn't the service pick it up?<br> - It's probably an emergency.<br> I'm calling from the gas station<br> down the road from your house.<br> I can be there in five minutes.<br> I'm going to,<br> unless you meet me right now.<br> No, Judah. No, Judah.<br> No. I wanna talk to you in person,<br> or I'm coming over.<br> - Just calm down, OK?<br> - You said we were going away.<br> I wanna be alone with you.<br> And when we get back,<br> I want you to bring everything<br> to a conclusion with Miriam.<br> I can't go on like this!<br> I can't wait for ever!<br> You don't know what it's like!<br> Maybe it would help if you<br> talked to somebody, like a therapist.<br> Don't trick me, Judah! Christ, I'm shaking.<br> Listen.<br> I brought you a birthday present.<br> I know how much you love Schubert.<br> Sometimes, when there's real love<br> and true acknowledgement of a mistake,<br> there can be forgiveness, too.<br> I know Miriam.<br> Her values, her feelings. Our place<br> among our friends and colleagues.<br> But what choice do you have<br> if the woman is going to tell her?<br> You have to confess the wrong<br> and hope for understanding.<br> I couldn't go on living<br> if I didn't feel with all my heart<br> a moral structure with real meaning and<br> forgiveness,<br> and some kind of higher power.<br> Otherwise,<br> there's no basis to know how to live.<br> And I know you well enough to know that<br> the spark of that notion is inside you, too.<br> Could you really go through with it?<br> What choice do I have, Ben?<br> Tell me.<br> Give the people that you've hurt<br> a chance to forgive you.<br> Miriam won't forgive me. She'll be broken.<br> She worships me.<br> She'll be humiliated before our friends.<br> This woman plans to make a stink.<br> - Did you make promises to her?<br> - No.<br> Maybe I led her on more than I realised.<br> She's so emotionally hungry.<br> - But it's deeper than just Miriam now.<br> - Meaning financial improprieties?<br> No.<br> Maybe I... Maybe I did<br> make some questionable moves.<br> Only you would know that, Judah.<br> I don't any more, Ben.<br> Sometimes it's worse than...<br> worse than jail.<br> It's a human life.<br> You don't think God sees?<br> God is a luxury I can't afford.<br> Now you're talking like your brother Jack.<br> Jack lives in the real world.<br> You live in the kingdom of heaven.<br> I managed to keep free of that real world<br> but... suddenly it's found me.<br> You fool around with her for pleasure<br> and then, when you think it's enough,<br> you wanna sweep her under the rug?<br> There's no other solution but Jack's, Ben.<br> I push one button and<br> I can sleep again nights.<br> Could you sleep with that?<br> Is that who you really are?<br> I will not be destroyed<br> by this neurotic woman.<br> But the law, Judah.<br> Without the law, it's all darkness.<br> You sound like my father.<br> What good is the law if it prevents me<br> from receiving justice?<br> Is what she's doing to me just?<br> Is this what I deserve?<br> Jack? It's Judah.<br> I think we should move ahead<br> with what we discussed.<br> How much will you need?<br> Not funny. It's not funny, guys.<br> No, it's not. You're not thinking funny.<br> You gotta think with your ear.<br> Do you understand what I'm telling you?<br> Here's the difference. It's very easy.<br> If it bends, it's funny.<br> If it breaks, it's not funny.<br> It's very simple. Wait a minute. Here.<br> - Jeff, this is Alva.<br> - Hi. Pleased to meet you.<br> Don't... Don't shoot this part.<br> Alva will play a small part in the new<br> series. I don't know what. I just want her.<br> - It's wonderful. You look great.<br> - Thank you.<br> They love you. Wonderful. Be right out.<br> OK. Don't do that while they're shooting.<br> It's messing my hair up.<br> Understand what I'm saying?<br> Think of Oedipus. Oedipus is funny.<br> That's the structure of funny, right there.<br> "Who did this terrible thing?"<br> "Oh, God - it was me. " That's funny.<br> But the difference is... Not while they're<br> shooting. What the hell are you doing?<br> You will notice that what we are aiming at<br> when we fall in love<br> is a very strange paradox.<br> The paradox consists of the fact<br> that, when we fall in love,<br> we are seeking to re-find<br> all or some of the people<br> to whom we were attached as children.<br> On the other hand, we ask our beloved<br> to correct all of the wrongs<br> that these early parents or siblings<br> inflicted upon us.<br> So that love contains in it<br> the contradiction:<br> The attempt to return to the past<br> and the attempt to undo the past.<br> See? No limos, no bimbos,<br> no awards or anything.<br> This guy's just a thinker, an intellect.<br> I was just thinking, when you show this to<br> the people that make the final decision,<br> you should emphasise<br> his overall view of life.<br> It's great. It's life-affirming.<br> They love a positive statement.<br> See, this is what I need. A little interest<br> in my work. A little encouragement. It's...<br> Let me ask you something. I got a bottle<br> of champagne as a prize, from Paris.<br> I got honourable mention for a little<br> documentary I did on leukaemia, and...<br> - You want some champagne?<br> - I never say no to champagne, or caviar.<br> OK. That's perfect. I have no caviar.<br> I have oat bran. It's better for your heart.<br> He was very eloquent on the subject<br> of love, didn't you think?<br> Yeah. I wish I'd read him<br> before I got married. You know?<br> Would've saved me<br> a gall bladder operation.<br> - What did you say?<br> - Nothing.<br> You know, he wrote a very interesting<br> book on human relationships.<br> He speaks very, very highly<br> of love at first sight.<br> My ex-husband and I fell in love at first<br> sight. I should've taken a second look.<br> No. Actually, it was my fault<br> as much as his.<br> I notice you still wear a wedding ring.<br> Any reason for that?<br> Well... I don't know. I guess<br> I'm just not ready to take it off.<br> It's good. It keeps me<br> from being asked out on dates.<br> You must have had a terrible marriage<br> if you don't want any dates.<br> Well, no... I mean, he was great.<br> He was very brilliant. He's an architect.<br> Real handsome and everything.<br> But if you're gonna have an affair, not<br> with my best friend in my four-poster bed.<br> And they didn't have to finish<br> all my pistachio nuts.<br> That inconsiderate?<br> I hope it hasn't soured you<br> on marriage or men.<br> - I can hear myself sounding like a bore.<br> - Just the opposite. Hello.<br> Yeah, she's here. How'd you know?<br> Hold on one second.<br> It's Lester.<br> Hello.<br> Yeah?<br> Sure, if you want me to.<br> OK. At the office? At what time?<br> - Nine?<br> - Nine o'clock? The building'll be dark.<br> The floor's dark. There's nobody<br> at the office. The office is closed.<br> You'll be in a dark room with Lester.<br> Yeah, the office is<br> kind of spooky at nine o'clock.<br> - Definitely.<br> - Sure. The hotel's even nearer.<br> - Don't go to the hotel.<br> - What was that?<br> OK. Room 1911. Sure.<br> OK, I'll see you there. OK.<br> You're not gonna go to the hotel with him.<br> It's crazy. I'd better go with you.<br> - Come on. Don't be ridiculous.<br> - He won't keep his hands off you.<br> He'll get you in a room, read you your<br> Miranda rights and tear your clothes off.<br> - He wants to produce something of mine.<br> - Your first child.<br> I've never been seduced by a guy<br> who wears loafers and no socks.<br> - Much less one who says "nucular".<br> - He also says "foilage".<br> - I don't like this.<br> - Why have you got Singin' in the Rain?<br> It's the one print that I own.<br> It's a very good 16mm print. I play it every<br> couple of months to get my spirits up.<br> You know, I saw it I don't know how many<br> years ago. I remember loving it.<br> They play it on television frequently.<br> You wanna watch it? I could<br> play it on this thing reel by reel.<br> - Wanna have dinner?<br> - Don't you have anything to do?<br> No, no. And, you know,<br> you got till nine o'clock.<br> Why not? There's an Indian restaurant<br> right near. I'll send out. We could...<br> # All I do is dream of you<br> the whole night through<br> # With the dawn, I still go on<br> dreaming of you<br> I love this Indian food.<br> It's great.<br> Want some more tandoori mouse?<br> Just kidding.<br> - You want some of the curry?<br> - Too hot, too hot.<br> My teeth are melting.<br> Boy, this is the perfect way<br> to see this movie.<br> It's great, isn't it?<br> When you see Lester later, be careful.<br> This guy tells you<br> he wants to exchange ideas<br> when what he wants is to exchange fluids.<br> - Yes?<br> - I have a delivery of some flowers.<br> So Chris and you<br> can't agree on your honeymoon.<br> We can agree. We've talked about a lot<br> of different places. It's just that...<br> I told Chris, and I told you before,<br> I want to go someplace warm.<br> But I also wanna do things like hike...<br> - You know, I hadn't thought of Australia.<br> - Not Australia.<br> I should've done what my friends told me.<br> Just go where we first wanted to go.<br> - Where did you first wanna go?<br> - We wanted to go to Italy.<br> Dad, it's Jack. He's on the phone.<br> - Who?<br> - Jack.<br> Well, go to Venice, Florence, Rome,<br> and do what you want to.<br> We can have sun, we can have snow,<br> we can have everything we want.<br> - All my friends have gone to Italy.<br> - You won't go there cos your friends did?<br> I just wanted you to know<br> everything came out fine.<br> It's over and done with,<br> so you can forget about it.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I'm in shock, Jack.<br> Judah, I'm telling you,<br> it's like the whole thing never existed.<br> It's a small burglary. Nothing more.<br> Yeah. So go on back to your life<br> and... put it behind you.<br> I can't speak.<br> I need a drink.<br> What am I gonna do?<br> I've got guests here now.<br> Jack... God have mercy on us, Jack.<br> Mom, you told me that Mary<br> has been having acupuncture.<br> - She's tried it.<br> - Yeah, for a few months.<br> She hasn't gone back. She stopped.<br> Is everything OK, sweetheart?<br> You look kind of upset.<br> I'm fine. It's just Jack.<br> She still wears a collar when she drives.<br> She can't look around.<br> - But it's done a lot.<br> I'd consider trying it.<br> - What about Oriental medicine?<br> I have a friend who consulted<br> a Chinese physician with an eye problem.<br> And he inserted a cat's whisker<br> into her tear duct.<br> She's been tellin' this story all week long.<br> - Well, it cured her.<br> - It did?<br> But you told me also he uses wires, too.<br> In acupuncture, you use needles.<br> - But very fine.<br> - That's a different procedure.<br> What do you think, Judah?<br> Judah?<br> Judah, what do you think?<br> I think I've done<br> a terrible thing.<br> What's wrong, honey?<br> I...<br> I left these papers at the office<br> which I absolutely need tonight.<br> I can't believe I did this. How negligent<br> of me. I've never done this before.<br> - I've got a major conference tomorrow...<br> - No, darling, you can't get them tonight.<br> I have to because<br> I've got an hour's work to do.<br> - But we're in the middle of a dinner party.<br> - I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.<br> - Don't apologise.<br> - I don't like him driving at night.<br> Stanley, I'm so sorry about this,<br> but I have to get these papers.<br> - Would you like some company?<br> - No, not at all.<br> - Darling, forgive me.<br> - Chris will take you.<br> It was a wonderful evening,<br> and if you're here when I get back...<br> - Thank you.<br> - Don't worry. We're fine.<br> I do apologise. Let's just finish the coffee,<br> sit down and... he'll be back.<br> I'll say it once again:<br> The eyes of God see all.<br> Listen to me, Judah. There is<br> absolutely nothing that escapes his sight.<br> He sees the righteous<br> and he sees the wicked.<br> And the righteous will be rewarded,<br> but the wicked will be punished<br> for eternity.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Hello. Hello?<br> I want your opinion. I'm doing a special<br> on jazz. I'd like to know what you think.<br> I admire her opinion so. Did you tell him<br> I wanna produce your idea for a series?<br> - No.<br> - It's great.<br> She wants to do a different Chekhov story<br> every month. He wrote a million of 'em.<br> - That's very sweet of you.<br> - I'm putty in your hands.<br> - What'll I do with a handful of putty?<br> - She's always got a zinger.<br> This vixen, this minx.<br> We should be going cos we have to pick<br> up those airsick bags we talked about.<br> I've got to get up at dawn<br> and teach Emily Dickinson to<br> upper-middle-class crack addicts.<br> - One of my favourite poets.<br> - Me, too.<br> - Because I could not stop for Death...<br> - He kindly stopped for me.<br> The word "kindly", right?<br> The carriage held but just ourselves<br> And Immortality.<br> We slowly drove, he knew no haste,<br> And I had put away<br> My labour, and my leisure too,<br> For his civility.<br> - Lester was a great English student.<br> - Not that I graduated.<br> It's amazing. I couldn't graduate, and<br> the same school now teaches a course<br> in existential motifs<br> in my situation comedies.<br> - Really?<br> - Where'd you go to college, Halley?<br> - Columbia.<br> - You went to Columbia?<br> - What'd you major in?<br> - Law. I graduated from the law school.<br> - You didn't practise?<br> - Yes, I did. But then, you know,<br> I met my husband and...<br> we moved to Europe for a while.<br> It's a long, boring story.<br> I wish you'd go back to your old job.<br> I used to edit newsreel footage so...<br> You know, floods and fires<br> and famines. It's depressing.<br> - We don't all have to go, you know.<br> - No, I do.<br> We'll go. You two stay.<br> You have business to talk over, right?<br> - I could go with you, if you like.<br> - Let's just go, OK?<br> - Let's go someplace quiet for a drink.<br> - I wouldn't mind that.<br> - I'm just exhausted.<br> - From what? It's early.<br> - Some other time.<br> - One little drink.<br> Really. Some other time.<br> Jesus. Lester was so pushy tonight.<br> He comes on with Halley like<br> it's business, but he's after her.<br> Oh, please. She really likes him. I can tell.<br> - You've gotta be kidding. She likes him?<br> - What's not to like?<br> - He's attractive, he's rich, he's charming.<br> - He's your brother. You're prejudiced.<br> She put him down pretty good<br> when he said "Let's go have a drink. "<br> I loved the way she said<br> "Some other time. "<br> - Fine. Enough already.<br> - That was pretty witty.<br> - What makes you think she likes him?<br> - Didn't you see her staring at him?<br> She probably can't believe her eyes.<br> You wouldn't pick up on it<br> if it hit you over the head.<br> You're not at all romantic.<br> That's the problem.<br> Hey, honey, you're the one<br> who stopped sleeping with me.<br> It'll be a year on April 20. I remember the<br> date exactly, cos it was Hitler's birthday.<br> I'm not discussing that any more.<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> I'll bet she's having a drink with him now.<br> For how much?<br> I'm serious. For how much?<br> You really know how to get my goat!<br> Hi. It's Clifford.<br> Yes, I knew you'd be in.<br> I just... You know.<br> Tonight was a lot of fun.<br> Wasn't Lester... so silly?<br> I mean, the guy is so self-important.<br> He was pushing all night.<br> I was frankly embarrassed for him.<br> What is he doing there?<br> You're talkin' business at 12 midnight?<br> Well... Gee, that could be very dangerous.<br> You want me...<br> You want me to come over?<br> OK. If you can handle it.<br> OK. I'll see you tomorrow.<br> I'm completely in love with Halley,<br> and Lester is startin' to make his move.<br> He wants her just<br> for a conquest. I can tell.<br> You know, it's so shallow,<br> and I'm crazy about her.<br> How can I compete with the guy?<br> He's rich and famous and successful.<br> - Come on. He's no competition for you.<br> - God bless you for saying that.<br> But you'll find, as you go through life, that<br> great depth and smouldering sensuality<br> does not always win, I'm sorry to say.<br> Meanwhile, his brother Ben, the rabbi,<br> he's a wonderful guy.<br> He called me last night. He's going blind.<br> He's got a terrible eye disease.<br> He's gonna be blind in a few months.<br> And he's got a great attitude.<br> He's really a mensch.<br> All right. Look left.<br> Now straight ahead, Ben.<br> Now to the right.<br> That's good.<br> My mother said that<br> I should go to the doctor,<br> because I was... My eyes weren't so good.<br> Well, you're an ophthalmologist.<br> Do you agree the eyes<br> are the windows of the soul?<br> Well, I believe they're windows,<br> but I'm not sure it's a soul I see.<br> My mother taught me I have a soul,<br> and it'll live on after me when I'm gone,<br> and if you look deeply enough<br> in my eyes, you can see it.<br> So what's the verdict?<br> Cos I'd like to get this resolved<br> before my daughter's wedding.<br> - Julie's getting married?<br> - Time passes quickly, doesn't it?<br> Remember she was just a baby?<br> Well, yours, too.<br> - Yes.<br> - Are you OK, Judah?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You don't look so good.<br> I'm fine.<br> I just haven't been sleeping that well.<br> Tell me... if I'm not prying... did you ever<br> resolve your personal difficulties?<br> Yes, actually.<br> It resolved itself.<br> The woman listened to reason.<br> Did she?<br> That's wonderful. So you got a break.<br> Sometimes to have a little good luck<br> is the most brilliant plan.<br> Judah, relax. You're white.<br> You're gonna have a breakdown. It's over.<br> What do you expect me to be?<br> My old self?<br> I jump when the phone rings.<br> - No good can come of this, Jack.<br> - Don't be so guilty. I kept you uninvolved.<br> The guy who's responsible is gone.<br> He's back in New Orleans.<br> It's pure evil, Jack.<br> A man kills for money.<br> He doesn't even know his victims.<br> He kills, you pay him<br> and then he... he kills again.<br> What was your alternative?<br> How did I get in so deep? I...<br> What dream was I following?<br> Judah, you said it yourself a million<br> times. You only go around once.<br> Jack, I went to her place after.<br> I had to retrieve<br> some incriminating things.<br> I saw her there... just staring up.<br> An inert object.<br> There was nothing behind her eyes<br> if you looked into them.<br> All you saw was a<br> black void.<br> Can I help you?<br> I used to live in this house once.<br> Really? When?<br> Many years ago.<br> My brother and I<br> used to race through these rooms.<br> He was a wonderful kid, my brother.<br> We were very close in those days.<br> My father had high hopes for him,<br> but it never seemed to... work out for him.<br> Would you mind if I just take a minute?<br> Everything seems to be<br> flooding through me.<br> Sure.<br> Come on, Sol. Get on with it. I'm hungry.<br> - Do you mind, May?<br> - It's nonsense anyway.<br> Why put us through this mumbo jumbo?<br> Bring on the main course.<br> I apologise for my disrespectful sister.<br> This is the twentieth century.<br> You have young boys sitting here.<br> - Don't fill their heads with superstition.<br> - The intellectual. The schoolteacher.<br> Spare us your Leninist philosophy<br> just this once.<br> Afraid if you don't obey the rules<br> God'll punish you?<br> - Not me, May. He punishes the wicked.<br> - Who? Like Hitler?<br> - We're having a Seder!<br> - Six million Jews burned to death<br> - and they got away with it.<br> - How did they get away with it?<br> Come on, Sol, open your eyes!<br> Six million Jews and millions of others.<br> - And they got off.<br> - How could humans do such a thing?<br> Because might makes right.<br> - Until the Americans marched in...<br> - I don't like this talk at my Seder.<br> OK, OK! All right!<br> I think this is interesting.<br> You know, there's this joke about<br> the prizefighter who enters the ring.<br> And his brother says to the family priest<br> "Father, pray for him. "<br> The priest said "I will.<br> But if he can punch, it'll help. "<br> What are you saying, May? You challenge<br> the whole moral structure of everything?<br> What moral structure? Is that the kind<br> of nonsense you use on your pupils?<br> Do you not find human impulses<br> basically decent?<br> - There's basically nothing.<br> - Such a cynic, my sister. A nihilist.<br> - Back to Russia!<br> - Well... Listen.<br> I happen to agree with May<br> when it comes to all that mumbo jumbo.<br> How can you say that? You come<br> to every Seder. You pray in Hebrew.<br> Yes. I'm going through the motions.<br> It's like any ritual. It's a habit.<br> What are you saying, May? There's<br> no morality anywhere in the whole world?<br> For those who want morality,<br> there's morality.<br> - Nothing's handed down in stone.<br> - Sol's kind of faith is a gift.<br> It's like an ear for music,<br> or the talent to draw.<br> He believes. You can use logic<br> on him and he still believes.<br> Must everything be logical?<br> And if a man commits a crime,<br> if he... if he kills...<br> - One way or another he will be punished.<br> - If he's caught, Sol.<br> If he's not, that which originates from a<br> black deed will blossom in a foul manner.<br> - You're relying too heavily on the Bible.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Whether it's the Old Testament<br> or Shakespeare, murder will out.<br> - Who said anything about murder?<br> - You did.<br> Did I?<br> And I say,<br> if he can do it and get away with it<br> and he chooses<br> not to be bothered by the ethics,<br> then he's home free.<br> Remember,<br> history is written by the winners.<br> If the Nazis had won, future generations<br> would see World War II quite differently.<br> Your aunt is a brilliant woman, Judah,<br> but she's had a very unhappy life.<br> And if all your faith is wrong, Sol?<br> Just what if, huh? If?<br> I'll still have a better life<br> than all of those that doubt.<br> Wait a minute. Are you telling me<br> that you prefer God to the truth?<br> If necessary,<br> I will always choose God over truth.<br> I agree with him.<br> I say what goes around comes around.<br> - Are you OK?<br> - Yes.<br> - I was worried. It's late.<br> - I had some business.<br> - Mrs Ames is waiting.<br> - Any messages?<br> Yeah. An odd one.<br> A Detective O'Donnell called.<br> He wanted to talk to you about something.<br> I tried to get him to tell me what,<br> but he said he only wants to talk with you.<br> # He says "Murder", he says<br> # Every time we kiss,<br> he says "Murder", he says<br> # Keep it up like this<br> and then "Murder", he says<br> # In that impossible tone<br> # Will bring on<br> nobody's murder but his own<br> That was not such a great movie,<br> but it was fun.<br> Yeah, I liked it. I think maybe<br> when I'm older, I wanna be an actress.<br> Don't be an actress. I want you to be<br> on the Supreme Court, or a doctor.<br> You know, show business is dog-eat-dog.<br> It's worse than dog-eat-dog. It's dog<br> doesn't return other dog's phone calls.<br> Which reminds me,<br> I should check my service.<br> Though I haven't had a message<br> in seven years.<br> I call up and I hear the girls giggling.<br> - How's Halley?<br> - She's great.<br> I'm gonna make my move there, I think.<br> But I have this ethical dilemma cos I'm<br> married. You shouldn't know about that.<br> Clifford Stern. Any messages?<br> Can you check, please?<br> My heart says one thing.<br> My head says another.<br> Very hard to get your heart and head<br> together in life. Let me teach you that.<br> Mine aren't even friendly.<br> Yes.<br> Really?<br> No.<br> OK, thank you.<br> What's wrong?<br> Professor Levy<br> committed suicide.<br> But we must always remember<br> that we, when we are born,<br> we need a great deal of love in order<br> to persuade us to stay in life.<br> Once we get that love<br> it usually lasts us.<br> But the universe is a pretty cold place.<br> It's we who invest it with our feelings.<br> And, under certain conditions,<br> we feel that the thing<br> isn't worth it any more.<br> I came as soon as I heard.<br> I thought you might not wanna be alone.<br> God, it's been terrible. You know?<br> I called... The guy was not sick at all.<br> And he left a note, a simple note:<br> "I've gone out the window. "<br> This is a major intellectual, and this is<br> his note. What the hell does that mean?<br> This guy was a role model.<br> You'd think he'd leave a decent note.<br> Did he have family or anything?<br> No. They were all killed in the war.<br> That's what's so strange.<br> He's seen the worst side of life.<br> He always was affirmative.<br> Always said yes to life. Yes, yes.<br> Now today, he said no.<br> Can you imagine his students?<br> How shattered they're gonna be?<br> I don't know from suicide.<br> Where I grew up in Brooklyn,<br> nobody committed suicide.<br> Everyone was too unhappy.<br> Boy, this will put a damper on the show.<br> I got 600,000 feet of film on this guy<br> and he's telling how great life is,<br> and now what am I gonna do?<br> I'll cut it up and make it into guitar picks.<br> I was thinking. No matter how elaborate<br> a philosophical system you work out,<br> in the end, it's gotta be incomplete.<br> I've been so annoyed all day.<br> I'm sorry for seeming cranky.<br> - I understand.<br> - This was such a blow.<br> I just thought<br> you might want some company.<br> No, don't do that.<br> It's something that<br> I've wanted to do now for weeks.<br> - You must know that.<br> - You're married.<br> Yes, I'm married,<br> but that's not gonna... last.<br> - I mean, you know...<br> - Well, you know, I'm... I'm not ready.<br> Is there something you're not telling me?<br> - No.<br> - Is there anybody else?<br> - I just don't want you to say it's Lester.<br> - It's me. It's just me.<br> I... I guess I haven't<br> gotten over my divorce yet.<br> And also, I feel unsettled about my career.<br> You don't know this<br> but I'm very ambitious,<br> and that's an area<br> that I'd like to get consolidated.<br> I just feel, you know, unsettled.<br> - Don't confuse me.<br> - I'm not trying to confuse you.<br> I don't know what I'm doing.<br> I better go. I should just leave.<br> - You just got here.<br> - I know, but I... you know.<br> - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...<br> - No, that's OK. It's<br> not... I'll see you soon.<br> I'll just... I'll be seeing you.<br> Please come in.<br> We read about it in the paper.<br> It's a terrible thing.<br> She'd been coming here for years.<br> - Please sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> Just a couple of questions, Doctor.<br> The record shows that she phoned you<br> here and at your home a number of times.<br> She was worried about her eyes.<br> - What was she suffering from?<br> - Nothing serious. She...<br> She had light flashes<br> and they alarmed her.<br> I could never find<br> anything very wrong with her.<br> And I told her that<br> it's just a common occurrence.<br> - She was a hypochondriac?<br> - No, I wouldn't say that but<br> she was concerned.<br> And there's nothing she ever said<br> that might be relevant to the case?<br> Personal life? Friends?<br> No. Not really.<br> How did she come to you?<br> You know, I honestly can't remember.<br> - Possibly another patient.<br> - Can I get that name?<br> Well, it was a while ago<br> and I... I treat so many patients.<br> Might it be in your records?<br> No. No, I... I doubt it very much.<br> - Well, I'm sorry to take up your time.<br> - That's all right.<br> If you remember anything,<br> will you give me a call?<br> Sure.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Pleasure.<br> Judah, you're having a breakdown.<br> The police know she phoned me.<br> I lied, but they saw through it.<br> - I can't take this, Jack.<br> - Pull yourself together or you'll blow it.<br> I did it, and it's irrevocable,<br> and now I'm gonna pay.<br> I had to fight an urge to confess<br> to the police. I want this off my mind.<br> Listen. I'm in this with you. I helped you<br> out and I don't wanna go to jail for it.<br> You may not care<br> if you drag me down with you,<br> ... but I'm not letting that happen.<br> - What the hell is that? A threat?<br> - Just be a man. You're in the clear.<br> - You'll rub me out, too?<br> - Don't talk nonsense.<br> What did you mean by saying<br> you won't let it happen?<br> You're my brother.<br> You've helped me out financially.<br> I did you a favour when you needed it.<br> Now all of a sudden you want to confess?<br> The time to confess was to Miriam,<br> about your mistress. Not about this.<br> This is murder. You paid for it,<br> I engineered it. It's over. Forget about it.<br> One sin leads to a deeper sin.<br> - Now you sound like Papa.<br> - Adultery, fornication, lies, killing.<br> - Shut up already.<br> - Or you'll have your friends shut me up?<br> One phone call,<br> like pushing a button, right?<br> Judah, I don't know what's wrong with<br> you these days. You're a different person.<br> I believe in God, Miriam.<br> I know it... because without God<br> the world is a cesspool.<br> You're drinking steadily and every day.<br> You never used to. It's something new.<br> - God, it's hot in here.<br> - Well, maybe we should go.<br> - Don't tell me what I should do, dammit!<br> - Judah, will you calm down!<br> I don't feel well.<br> I'm gonna get a little air.<br> No, you stay here.<br> Look, this story on the homeless,<br> it's too long.<br> I want five pages. Make sure<br> he gets five real pages out of it.<br> He tells the secretary to type it tighter.<br> He doesn't take anything out.<br> I want Joe Hanson off the show.<br> He doesn't write funny. If he has cancer,<br> I'll send him flowers. I want him off.<br> Jesus! Doesn't anybody<br> know how to write funny any more?<br> Am I supposed to write it myself?<br> Direct it myself? Produce it myself?<br> I can't believe this! Look at those people<br> out there! Look out the window at them.<br> These people are lookin'<br> for something funny in their lives!<br> You're givin' 'em straight lines!<br> They're waitin' for something funny!<br> This is terrible.<br> What are you doing to me?<br> This is supposed to be<br> the profile of a creative mind.<br> It's tough for a woman in this profession.<br> I can make it easier for you.<br> What is this? When did you shoot that?<br> I was lurking around the corner.<br> I couldn't resist.<br> I don't wanna do it in kind of a vulgar way<br> and just take it off what I see here.<br> I wanna find out what's in here,<br> so I gotta spend some time with you.<br> We'll have a little dinner together, just...<br> OK, step aside. I'm taking over this film.<br> - What? You can't finish my film.<br> - I can't? Read your contract.<br> - You promised.<br> - Look, the idea was to show the real me.<br> I may not be perfect, but I don't promote<br> values that... Let me quote you exactly:<br> "That deaden the sensibilities<br> of a great democracy".<br> You're fired, Cliff!<br> You're out! Get outta here!<br> Go! Thank you! Goodbye!<br> If it bends, it's funny.<br> If it breaks, it isn't.<br> Come on now. Don't get discouraged.<br> You have your own personal vision.<br> Why is he so upset? You'd think nobody<br> was ever compared to Mussolini before.<br> I had no idea you would cut the film like<br> this. I'd have told you they'd never use it.<br> They want an upbeat profile of Lester.<br> Now he's gonna re-cut it<br> and make himself into a saint.<br> Wendy's right. I'm probably jealous<br> of him. His limos, his money, his women.<br> You have your own style.<br> Hey, listen. Marry me. I'm serious.<br> That's the only thing that'll satisfy me.<br> I'm crazy about you. You're single.<br> My marriage won't last.<br> I gotta talk to you. Can we just...<br> Can we sit down here for a second?<br> I'm not joking. I'm really nuts about you.<br> I'm going away.<br> Yeah? Meaning what?<br> I've... I'm... I've got a chance<br> to produce a couple of shows in London<br> and I couldn't say no.<br> So how long are you going for?<br> Well, probably three or four months.<br> Three or four months?<br> Jesus, you're kidding.<br> What a discouraging thought.<br> But, you know,<br> I think it's a good thing, because I ne...<br> Well, it'll give me a little distance.<br> About 3,000 miles, to be exact.<br> - When are you leaving?<br> - I guess... ten days or so.<br> God, I'm...<br> God, I'm gonna miss you.<br> I don't know what to say. I just...<br> I'm not gonna see you<br> for three or four months?<br> I feel like I... you know,<br> like I've been handed a prison sentence.<br> Ben, your daughter<br> will make a beautiful bride.<br> This is Barbara,<br> the sister of my brother-in-law.<br> Congratulations.<br> I wish your daughter all the happiness.<br> Jesus. I'm so self-conscious.<br> Every single thing on me is rented.<br> I got a rented tux,<br> rented shoes, rented underwear.<br> You look terrific. Cliff, do me a favour.<br> This is your last occasion with my family.<br> Could we try to get along?<br> And this is Dr Rosenthal.<br> I'm Miriam.<br> - And this is Marion, and this is Peter.<br> - How do you do? A pleasure to meet you.<br> - Judah?<br> - Yes, Ben.<br> Judah, I'm so glad you could make it.<br> It means a lot.<br> What is the matter with you?<br> You seem so depressed.<br> Wendy and I finally decided<br> to call it quits.<br> Even though the last couple of years have<br> been terrible, it just makes me feel sad.<br> - I'll have a vodka and tonic.<br> - I'll have one, too.<br> But, you know, you told me<br> it's been platonic for a year.<br> And I say once the sex goes, it all goes.<br> It's true. Last time I was inside a woman<br> was when I visited the Statue of Liberty.<br> Look at your father.<br> He's celebrating enough for two.<br> He and Ben will get high<br> and argue about belief and God.<br> My father takes after his Aunt May.<br> She rejected the Bible because she said<br> it had an unbelievable central character.<br> I walked in. I said "The Waldorf-Astoria.<br> The centrepieces. " Did you see them?<br> - Beautiful.<br> - Everything matches. Lester paid for it.<br> Hard to believe<br> a brother would pay for a wedding.<br> Hard to believe, but that's the sort of thing<br> Lester is always doing. Isn't it?<br> He must be a good brother.<br> I'm gonna get one like that.<br> It's much better. This is very square.<br> - Hi, Cliff.<br> - Cliff. Hello.<br> Lester. How are you? Good to see you.<br> - My fiancee, Halley Reed.<br> - Congratulations. My wife Nancy.<br> - When'd you get back?<br> - Got back this morning.<br> - I've been trying to call you all day.<br> - I finally won her heart.<br> What a romantic story.<br> We ran into each other in London<br> and I sent her white roses<br> around the clock, all the time, for days.<br> For days. And then<br> I found out she was allergic.<br> - Hi, Lester.<br> - Hi. Good to see you.<br> So, I started pleading with her. I begged<br> her. I just... begged her day and night.<br> And I think it was the caviar that did it.<br> I tell you, I've envied this guy for years.<br> He'd show up with a beautiful woman<br> every time. But I envy you more now.<br> Thank you.<br> Standing here in the presence of God,<br> the guardian of our homes,<br> ready to enter into the bonds of wedlock,<br> answer each of you in reverence for God<br> and in the hearing of the assembly that<br> have gathered here so joyously with you.<br> - I know the perfect guy for you.<br> - Who?<br> - He's brilliant. He's attractive.<br> - There's a hitch. I'm waiting.<br> There's a hitch, but it sounds<br> worse than it is. He's in prison.<br> - Rita, I would say that's a drawback.<br> - Nothing terrible. Insider trading.<br> He made a fortune in the market.<br> And he'll be out soon.<br> Very soon. A couple of years.<br> You mean with good behaviour.<br> Cliff?<br> I wanted to talk to you.<br> What is there really to say?<br> You know, I'm just stunned still.<br> He's not what you think.<br> He's wonderful. He's...<br> He's warm and caring and...<br> - romantic...<br> - He's a success. That's what he is.<br> - He's rich and he's a success.<br> - Give me a little credit.<br> I always did give you<br> a little credit, until today.<br> We used to laugh at this guy. The silly<br> shows he puts on, the way he talks.<br> He's endearing.<br> This is my worst fear realised.<br> I wanted to give you this letter back.<br> - It's my one love letter.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> I'm just... the wrong person.<br> It's probably just as well.<br> I plagiarised most of it from James Joyce.<br> You probably wondered<br> why all the references to Dublin.<br> Look, I...<br> I hope we can always be friends.<br> Off by yourself, huh? You're like me.<br> I always get sad at these kind of events.<br> You look very deep in thought.<br> I was plotting the perfect murder.<br> Yeah? Movie plot?<br> Movie?<br> Ben... That's what Ben told me.<br> He says you make films.<br> Yeah, but not that kind... You know.<br> A different kind.<br> I have a great murder story.<br> - Yes?<br> - Great plot.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, I've had too many to drink.<br> I mean, forgive me.<br> I know you want your privacy.<br> No, it's OK. You know.<br> I'm not doing anything special.<br> Except my murder story has<br> a very strange twist.<br> Yeah?<br> Let's say there's this man<br> who's very successful.<br> He has everything.<br> - Let me ask you something.<br> - What?<br> Am I a phoney?<br> - What?<br> - Am I a phoney?<br> - Are you a little high or something?<br> - No, I'm... I think he hates me.<br> - Who hates you?<br> - Your annoying husband.<br> Every time I'm with him, I get tense.<br> - It's just that he's angry.<br> - At what?<br> Are you kidding me? He's got these<br> fantasies about changing the world.<br> He makes these films<br> and they come to nothing.<br> Listen, honey. He's gotta grow up.<br> This is the real world. This is the big time.<br> They don't pay off on high aspirations.<br> You gotta deliver.<br> Not to mention... You're still young.<br> You're not gettin' the life that you deserve.<br> Lester, I met somebody.<br> That...<br> That is music to my ears.<br> And after the awful deed is done,<br> he finds that he's plagued<br> by deep-rooted guilt.<br> Little sparks of his religious background,<br> which he'd rejected,<br> are suddenly stirred up.<br> He... hears his father's voice.<br> He... imagines that God<br> is watching his every move.<br> Suddenly it's not an empty universe at all,<br> but a just and moral one, and...<br> he's violated it.<br> Now he's panic-stricken.<br> He's on the verge of a mental collapse.<br> An inch away from confessing<br> the whole thing to the police.<br> And then, one morning, he awakens and<br> the sun is shining and<br> his family is around him and<br> mysteriously the crisis has lifted.<br> He takes his family on a vacation to<br> Europe and as the months pass he finds<br> he's not punished.<br> In fact, he prospers.<br> The killing gets attributed to a drifter who<br> has several other murders to his credit<br> so, what the hell,<br> one more doesn't even matter.<br> Now he's scot-free.<br> His life is completely back to normal.<br> Back to his protected world<br> of wealth and privilege.<br> Yes, but can he ever really go back?<br> Well... People carry sins<br> around with them.<br> Maybe once in a while<br> he has a bad moment, but it passes.<br> And, with time, it all fades.<br> Yeah, but... so then, you know,<br> his worst beliefs are realised.<br> Well, I said it was a chilling story,<br> didn't I?<br> I don't know. It'd be tough<br> for somebody to live with that.<br> Very few guys could actually<br> live with that on their conscience.<br> People carry awful deeds<br> around with them.<br> What do you expect him to do?<br> Turn himself in?<br> I mean, this is reality.<br> In reality, we rationalise, we deny,<br> or we couldn't go on living.<br> Here's what I would do.<br> I would have him turn himself in.<br> Cos then, you see, your story<br> assumes tragic proportions<br> because, in the absence of a God,<br> he is forced to assume<br> that responsibility himself.<br> Then you have tragedy.<br> But that's fiction. That's movies.<br> You see too many movies.<br> I'm talkin' about reality.<br> I mean, if you want a happy ending,<br> you should go see a Hollywood movie.<br> Come on, darling.<br> Let's think about going home, huh?<br> Nice talkin' to you. Good luck.<br> Miriam, we're gonna make a wedding<br> like this for Sharon. And I can't wait.<br> She'll be radiant.<br> - You're looking very handsome tonight.<br> - And you look beautiful.<br> We are all faced throughout<br> our lives with agonising decisions.<br> Moral choices.<br> Some are on a grand scale.<br> Most of these choices<br> are on lesser points.<br> But we define ourselves<br> by the choices we have made.<br> We are, in fact,<br> the sum total of our choices.<br> Events unfold so unpredictably,<br> so unfairly.<br> Human happiness does not<br> seem to have been included<br> in the design of creation.<br> It is only we, with our capacity to love,<br> that give meaning<br> to the indifferent universe.<br> And yet, most human beings seem<br> to have the ability to keep trying,<br> and even to find joy,<br> from simple things,<br> like their family,<br> their work,<br> and from the hope that future<br> generations might understand more.<br>
