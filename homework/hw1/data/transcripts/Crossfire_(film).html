                        Was Samuels drunk<br> when you left him in this bar?<br> No.<br> - Had he been drinking?<br> - Yes, but he was all right.<br> At the bar, what was he arguing<br> with the soldier about?<br> They weren't arguing,<br> they were just talking.<br> I sent Sammy over to talk<br> to the soldier myself.<br> I saw he was upset about something.<br> What was the soldier? I mean, what rank?<br> I didn't notice. I left them.<br> - Where did you go?<br> - Up to my room.<br> It was the bar in my hotel.<br> I had to change, so I told Sammy<br> I'd meet him here.<br> We had a date for dinner.<br> I rested a while, and I fell asleep.<br> I called to say that I'd be a little late.<br> There wasn't any answer.<br> I came over just as soon<br> as I could find a cab.<br> Then I called you.<br> - Do I have to stay here?<br> - No.<br> I'll get somebody to drive you home.<br> Could he have hit his head<br> on the table when he fell?<br> He could have,<br> but with the beating he took...<br> ...it wouldn't have made<br> much difference.<br> - Take Miss Lewis home.<br> - Right.<br> Check at the bar while you're there. They<br> won't know anything, but check anyway.<br> There were three soldiers.<br> She left Samuels talking to one.<br> Make a report for the Army and have the<br> provost marshal's office locate this man.<br> All right, Miss Lewis.<br> What do you want?<br> - I'm sorry. I must have the wrong place.<br> - What place are you looking for?<br> I thought it was this apartment.<br> I was looking for a buddy.<br> You cops?<br> - Has something happened?<br> - Tell us about this buddy of yours.<br> Yes, sir. Well, we was here.<br> He left before we did. Wasn't feeling<br> good. Said he'd be right back...<br> Who's "we"?<br> - Me and another buddy of mine.<br> - Who'd you come here with?<br> With these two buddies of mine<br> and this fella.<br> What fella?<br> This fella we met in a bar.<br> Was this young lady with him?<br> - Was she with him?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Is this the one who was with Samuels?<br> - No. It was another one.<br> What happened?<br> Somebody killed this fella<br> you met in the bar.<br> Same fella?<br> What's your name?<br> Montgomery, sir.<br> Were you drunk tonight?<br> Well, I had a couple,<br> but I can handle that.<br> How long you been out of the service?<br> - Two weeks, about.<br> - You live here?<br> - No, sir.<br> - What are you doing in Washington?<br> I came back to see<br> a couple of my buddies.<br> - Where are you staying?<br> - Stewart Hotel.<br> I used to be stationed at the Stewart.<br> - I'm sponging a bunk from a buddy.<br> - What's his name, this one who was sick...<br> ...who was coming back?<br> Mitchell. Mitch, we called him.<br> Corporal Arthur Mitchell?<br> - Where did you find it?<br> - In the sofa.<br> - Must have dropped out of his pocket.<br> - What's his outfit?<br> - Same as mine was.<br> - What were you in?<br> Signal Corps Detachment, Stewart Hotel.<br> Okay, clean it up.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Closing up at 12.<br> - Since when?<br> - Since tonight.<br> - Tonight we close early.<br> - Why tonight?<br> - Mitchell's coming back.<br> - So what? Deal him in.<br> - No, we're going crawling.<br> - What are you, his father or something?<br> Come on in.<br> - Everybody in here belong on this floor?<br> - Yep.<br> - Whose room is this?<br> - Mitchell and Keeley.<br> - Which one of you is Mitchell?<br> - He's not here.<br> - Where is he?<br> - I don't know.<br> - When will he be back?<br> - I don't know.<br> - All right, who's Keeley?<br> - That's me.<br> - Cops wanna talk to you, soldier.<br> - What about?<br> About Mitchell.<br> - What about Mitchell?<br> - About Mitchell killing a guy.<br> Okay, deal.<br> Sergeant Keeley.<br> Sorry to break up your little<br> Saturday-night game, sergeant.<br> Where's Mitchell?<br> - Who's he supposed to have killed?<br> - Sit down, sergeant. We'll talk about it.<br> - When did you see Mitchell last?<br> - This afternoon, 2:00.<br> - Where was he going?<br> - Crawling.<br> - Where?<br> - Nowhere.<br> Soldiers don't have anywhere to go<br> unless you tell them.<br> When they're off duty, they go crawling,<br> or they go crazy.<br> - What did you do before the Army?<br> - What's that got to do with it?<br> It might help me understand<br> your answers.<br> I worked on newspapers.<br> - What kind of a job you got now?<br> - Ink job.<br> Purple ink. Instead of the Purple Heart,<br> we get purple ink.<br> - Mitchell too?<br> - Signs.<br> He's an artist. He used to do<br> cows eating grass.<br> He's branched out now. He does signs.<br> "Keep This Washroom Clean."<br> - You think he killed anybody, you're crazy.<br> - Why?<br> - He's not the type.<br> - Everybody's the type.<br> - He couldn't kill anybody.<br> - Could you?<br> - I have.<br> - Where?<br> Where you get medals for it.<br> I see.<br> And this Mitchell boy<br> couldn't do that either?<br> No.<br> Tell me about this afternoon<br> when he left.<br> - Nothing to tell. He left.<br> - What did you talk to Mrs. Mitchell about?<br> According to the hotel, you called Chicago<br> this afternoon at 2:30...<br> ...and talked to a Mrs. Mitchell.<br> His mother?<br> His wife.<br> - Well?<br> - It was personal. It wouldn't interest you.<br> Nothing interests me anymore.<br> Used to, but not anymore.<br> I've been at this job too long.<br> I go about it the only way I know how.<br> I collect all the facts possible.<br> Most of them are useless.<br> What did you call Mrs. Mitchell about?<br> She called me first. Last week. She was<br> worried about him. He hadn't written.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Well, then guess.<br> - He's homesick. He's wife-sick.<br> Maybe something in her letters made him<br> suspicious of her love life. I don't know.<br> Anyway, he's got snakes. He's been nuts.<br> - But not nuts enough to kill somebody.<br> - How was he this afternoon?<br> He was trying to act like a soldier.<br> I think he went out to look for a girl.<br> What's your name, anyway?<br> Finlay.<br> Look, Finlay, this sort of life<br> doesn't bother some soldiers.<br> Doesn't bother me much.<br> I haven't seen my wife for two years.<br> When I do, maybe we'll pick up again.<br> Maybe we won't.<br> But I don't worry about it now.<br> Mitchell isn't like that.<br> Mitchell isn't tough.<br> He needs his wife.<br> I called her and told her what I thought:<br> She ought to hop a plane and come<br> down here and cheer him up.<br> She's on her way now.<br> She'll be here tonight.<br> I still don't know what this is all about.<br> Why did you pick me up?<br> You're Mitchell's closest friend,<br> aren't you?<br> I don't advertise it.<br> Mitchell's other friend told us about you.<br> Let's have Montgomery back.<br> Where does Montgomery come in?<br> He was with Mitchell and a boy named<br> Floyd Bowers this afternoon in a bar.<br> They met a Mr. Samuels there<br> and went up to his apartment.<br> Mitchell left first but told Montgomery<br> he was coming back.<br> We were looking at Samuels' body when<br> Montgomery came looking for Mitchell.<br> You're just taking Montgomery's word<br> that Mitch went to this apartment?<br> Not entirely.<br> We found Mitchell's wallet there,<br> down behind a sofa cushion.<br> Where's Bowers?<br> Keeley. You hear all this<br> they're trying to pin on Mitch?<br> Part of it.<br> This is serious.<br> They're crucifying the kid.<br> - You know Mitch. He won't have a chance.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Well, I just mean that...<br> ...Mitch is not the kind of guy who knows<br> the scoop on a thing like this.<br> He's an artist. He's sensitive.<br> - And you know all about things like this?<br> - Well, sure. Like I told you...<br> ...l've been a cop myself. St. Louis.<br> Four years on the east side.<br> I know the score.<br> Then you can understand<br> why I need your help.<br> I'm not helping stick a pal of mine<br> into trouble.<br> I'm not asking you to.<br> All I'm asking for is facts.<br> How did it get started this afternoon<br> in the bar with Samuels?<br> Like always. Bunch of people in a bar.<br> Something happens,<br> you're talking to somebody.<br> What happened?<br> Leroy knocked a drink all over this...<br> What did you say her name was?<br> This Miss Lewis.<br> You didn't tell me about Leroy.<br> He's a dumb hillbilly.<br> A friend of Floyd's.<br> He came in with Floyd,<br> but he didn't stay long.<br> Go on.<br> Well, like I said, we was talking.<br> I was worried about Mitch.<br> What's the matter, Mitch?<br> What's eating you?<br> - Nothing's eating me.<br> - Let's go. Nothing's gonna happen here.<br> Sit still. The idea is to sit still.<br> You don't meet people by going<br> in and out of one bar after another.<br> - I'm sorry, I...<br> - It was an accident.<br> You silly hillbilly.<br> Why don't you look what you're doing.<br> You'll have to forgive Leroy.<br> Leroy's from Tennessee.<br> He just started wearing shoes.<br> - Apologize to the lady.<br> - I said I'm sorry.<br> - That the best you can do?<br> - It was just an accident, soldier.<br> Leroy's all right. He's just dumb.<br> He was our secret weapon.<br> Won the war with him.<br> By not letting him across.<br> He's that dumb.<br> If the Krauts caught him and asked<br> how many generals we had...<br> ...Leroy would've told them.<br> Because his mother said,<br> "Leroy, never tell a lie."<br> - Where you going?<br> - See you, Floyd.<br> Well, look there, now.<br> I hurt Leroy's feelings.<br> Right back, Sammy.<br> That's the way it is, Sammy.<br> That's what you get when you get<br> an army full of civilians.<br> I been in the regular Army, see?<br> But I been out a couple of weeks.<br> Same as Floyd. And am I glad to be out.<br> I had enough of an army<br> full of stinking civilians.<br> I never seen anything like these guys.<br> Some of them are okay, get that.<br> Now, Mitch here, he's okay.<br> He was one of my boys.<br> He's very talented.<br> But most of them, they got no manners.<br> Floyd, will you give me my drink?<br> And the stealing.<br> I never seen as much stealing<br> as we had.<br> One day, one of the men complains<br> he had swiped from him...<br> ...a wristwatch his mother sent him.<br> His mother sent him.<br> Half these guys, I think, got no mothers.<br> They got no respect for the service.<br> You can tell a man by<br> how he don't respect the service.<br> He don't respect the service,<br> he don't respect his mother.<br> That's the kind of a guy that spoilt<br> the Army for a guy like me.<br> When I got in, it was a good racket.<br> You could live good.<br> You played it smart, you could save<br> - Take me, when I...<br> - What I couldn't do with 1000 bucks.<br> What would you do with 1000 bucks?<br> Well, man, if I had 1000 bucks, I could...<br> Well, I could go to Mexico...<br> ...California...<br> Know what I'd do? I'd live on the beach.<br> I'd fish, and I'd eat...<br> ...and just live on the beach.<br> And I'd steal me a air-cooled machine gun.<br> I shoot anybody tried to bring me back.<br> Criminy, Monty, what's the use<br> of being out if you got no dough?<br> - Wonder where I should go.<br> - Floyd and me talked some more.<br> I don't know how long. The next time<br> I looked, they were leaving.<br> So we left then too. Things were<br> pretty expensive in that bar anyway.<br> I figured if the Jew boy was setting up<br> drinks, we might as well get in on it.<br> We followed them to the apartment<br> and just walked in.<br> Hiya, Sammy. We come to the party.<br> - There isn't any party, sergeant.<br> - You thought you could skip out on us.<br> You feel sick?<br> - I'm all right.<br> - Maybe you better go get some air.<br> - Mitch. What's the matter, boy?<br> - I'll be right back.<br> - You want me to come with you?<br> - I'm all right. I'll be right back.<br> - I have to get ready to go in a few minutes.<br> - That's too bad, Sammy.<br> We gotta look after Mitch. Come on.<br> - Here's to you, Sammy.<br> - Come on, Floyd.<br> Thanks just the same, Sammy.<br> And that was the last we seen of Sammy,<br> the last we seen of Mitch.<br> He wasn't outside. I couldn't figure out<br> where he'd got to.<br> Floyd was pretty stinko. I started back to<br> the Stewart with him. Then I got worried.<br> I put him in a cab and went back<br> to look for Mitch.<br> - And ran right into me.<br> - You ought to know.<br> You came up to Samuels' apartment<br> even though you saw police cars?<br> Well, how did I know they had<br> anything to do with Samuels?<br> You're just a bunch of hick cops here.<br> You won't pin anything on Mitch.<br> Not in 100 years.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's just that I'm worried sick<br> about Mitch.<br> Did you have some sort of<br> an argument with Samuels?<br> What was there to argue about?<br> His liquor was good. Everything was okay.<br> You'd never met him before?<br> No. I told you, I just met him in the bar.<br> I never even seen him before.<br> - You sure?<br> - Well, sure, I'm sure.<br> Of course...<br> ...seen a lot of guys like him.<br> - Like what?<br> - Oh, you know...<br> ...guys that played it safe during the war.<br> Scrounged around keeping<br> themselves in civvies.<br> Got swell apartments, swell dames.<br> You know the kind.<br> I'm not sure that I do. Just what kind?<br> Oh, you know...<br> ...some of them are named Samuels.<br> Some of them got funnier names.<br> You'll be at the Stewart Hotel?<br> Sure. I got nowhere else to go.<br> I'm sponging a bunk from one of the boys.<br> Coming, Keeley?<br> There are one or two more questions<br> I'd like to ask Sergeant Keeley.<br> He ought to look at a casualty list.<br> There are a lot of funny names there too.<br> I said Monty was illiterate.<br> Said he ought to read.<br> - I was just philosophizing.<br> - I'm not interested in philosophy.<br> I'm trying to solve a murder.<br> Mitchell was in a strange mood tonight.<br> You admit that.<br> He left Samuels' apartment<br> intending to come back.<br> We arrive and find Samuels<br> beaten to death.<br> And we find Mitchell's wallet<br> in the sofa.<br> I say Mitchell did come back.<br> - Some sort of an argument developed...<br> - I say you're nuts.<br> Why? Or don't you think Mitchell<br> could kill Samuels that way?<br> I don't think Mitchell would kill<br> anybody any way.<br> - You still don't know where he is?<br> - No.<br> I didn't know when I came in,<br> and I haven't suddenly gotten brighter.<br> - You don't believe he did it.<br> - He was there.<br> - So were Floyd and Monty.<br> - They left. Mitch said he was returning.<br> - According to Monty.<br> - To Monty.<br> Monty's a liar.<br> What makes you believe his story?<br> - Happens to be the only story I've got.<br> - Then why did you let him go?<br> Did I?<br> You don't think he's gonna lead you<br> to Floyd Bowers, do you?<br> Is that all for me?<br> You know where to find me.<br> Mitchell hasn't been here?<br> - What happened? Who'd he kill?<br> - He didn't kill anybody.<br> He's in trouble, but nobody knows<br> where he is. We gotta find him.<br> - What are we waiting for?<br> - That lobby is full of cops and MPs.<br> Spread out. Find him.<br> Try and tag him before he gets here.<br> Scare the pants off that knucklehead.<br> I made him promise<br> to meet me here at midnight.<br> That's an hour ago.<br> I was gonna watch him<br> till his wife showed up.<br> When you find him,<br> put him someplace safe.<br> I'll be waiting in the coffee shop.<br> One at a time. Don't go through that lobby<br> like a pack of drunken buffaloes.<br> You see Monty or Floyd, let me know.<br> - Where's Monty come in? What's he doing?<br> - Helping Mitch.<br> Every time he opens his mouth,<br> he hangs him a foot higher.<br> Where do you suppose<br> that stupid birdbrain is?<br> What's the matter, corporal?<br> - I'm all right.<br> - Don't sit on the curb.<br> - Just sit down to rest.<br> - Better go rest somewheres else.<br> Papers all right? Okay.<br> You don't want a little help?<br> - I'm all right, thanks.<br> - Well, watch yourself.<br> And don't sit on no more curbs.<br> You get killed that way.<br> Pickup on a Corporal Mitchell.<br> - 29645217.<br> - What for?<br> I don't know, but it's a double A.<br> Must have murdered somebody.<br> - Cup of coffee, please.<br> - Any luck?<br> Ask the desk if there<br> are any messages.<br> Mitch's wife might have phoned<br> from the airport.<br> Okay.<br> - Sure you know Mitchell when you see him?<br> - Sure.<br> Hi, Harry. What's the matter?<br> Which one?<br> Beat it.<br> - What's the matter, Keeley?<br> - Shut up.<br> - Break it up. Stand back.<br> - Got the wrong guy. Mitchell got away.<br> - He took off...<br> - You started after me.<br> What do you expect me to do,<br> get run over?<br> - Where's Keeley?<br> - Who's Keeley?<br> Okay, let him go.<br> Tragedy struck this great waterfront city<br> in the early hours of the morning.<br> Fire, starting in this warehouse,<br> spread quickly.<br> - I couldn't have killed this guy.<br> - That's not the point.<br> We can't stay here forever.<br> You've gotta have a story for the cops.<br> They've got Monty's, and it sounds<br> pretty good, but not for you.<br> I want you to tell me everything you can.<br> How drunk were you?<br> I don't know. Pretty drunk, I guess.<br> How long were you with this girl?<br> - Well, I...<br> - You ought to know.<br> Was it one hour, two hours, three hours?<br> I can't remember.<br> My head hurts.<br> - I can't remember any of it very well.<br> - Okay.<br> You ran into Monty and Leroy and Floyd.<br> And you went to some bar with them.<br> Okay, take it from the bar. Take it slow,<br> and remember everything you did.<br> Well, we were there<br> quite a while, I guess.<br> I got restless. I wanted to shove.<br> Monty was shooting off his mouth.<br> I wasn't really listening.<br> Some of them are okay, get that.<br> Now, Mitchell, here, he's okay.<br> He was one of my boys.<br> An artist. Very talented.<br> But most of them, they got no manners.<br> You don't wanna hear that. Let's have<br> a good time. Have another round.<br> You never seen such stealing.<br> I remember I was suddenly<br> sick of him and Floyd.<br> I wanted my wife.<br> I wanted to be alone.<br> I wanted to be somewhere else.<br> They got no respect for the service.<br> - What will you have?<br> - Beer.<br> My girl is worried about you.<br> We were talking about you<br> when that kid spilled that drink on her.<br> She says you're not drinking<br> but you're getting drunk anyway.<br> Anybody that can do that<br> has got a problem.<br> - It's a funny thing, isn't it?<br> - Very funny.<br> It's worse at night, isn't it?<br> I think maybe it's suddenly not having<br> a lot of enemies to hate anymore.<br> Maybe it's because for four years<br> we've been focusing our mind on...<br> On one little peanut.<br> The win-the-war peanut.<br> That was all. Get it over.<br> Eat that peanut.<br> All at once, no peanut.<br> Now we start looking at each other again.<br> We don't know<br> what we're supposed to do.<br> We don't know<br> what's supposed to happen.<br> We're too used to fighting.<br> But we just don't know what to fight.<br> You can feel the tension in the air.<br> A whole lot of fight and hate<br> that doesn't know where to go.<br> Guy like you maybe starts hating himself.<br> Well...<br> ...one of these days maybe<br> we'll all learn to shift gears.<br> Maybe we'll stop hating<br> and start liking things again, huh?<br> What sort of an artist are you?<br> I did a mural once in a post office<br> for the WPA.<br> Oh, a lot of fine artists came from there.<br> I thought at first<br> he was just plain screwy.<br> Then suddenly I changed my mind.<br> He was easy to talk to.<br> I don't remember<br> exactly what we talked about...<br> ... but I remember we talked<br> a lot about baseball.<br> I think he must have been<br> on a newspaper or something.<br> We were still talking<br> when his girl came back.<br> They wanted me to go out,<br> eat with them. That seemed all right.<br> I guess I said I would.<br> But she had to change, so we decided<br> to go up to his place and wait for her.<br> I don't remember<br> exactly what we talked about...<br> ... or how long before Monty<br> and Floyd came.<br> Suddenly I began to feel worse<br> instead of better.<br> Everything began to get fuzzy.<br> You're doing all right, kid.<br> You're doing all right.<br> You know what I'd do<br> if I had some dough, Sammy?<br> I'd go to the liquor store,<br> and I'd tell the man...<br> ...wrap up three bottles of this liquor.<br> Three bottles all at one time.<br> Sammy...<br> ...let me tell you something.<br> Not many civilians will take a soldier<br> into their house like this for a quiet talk.<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> A guy that's afraid to take a soldier<br> into his house, he stinks.<br> And I mean he stinks.<br> He ought to have the screws put to him.<br> Am I right, or am I right?<br> - Don't you think...?<br> - I asked you a question, Sammy.<br> - What was that?<br> - You know what was that.<br> Am I right, or am I right?<br> - You're right, sergeant.<br> - You can say that again.<br> You're all right, Sammy. You're okay.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - I'm all right.<br> I'll be right back.<br> I just need a little air.<br> - Can I get you anything?<br> - He's all right. You heard him.<br> - Let's have another round.<br> - There isn't time.<br> What kind of a brush is this?<br> What's the matter, Jew boy?<br> Afraid we'll drink all your<br> stinking wonderful liquor?<br> I didn't wanna hear anybody<br> yelling at anybody.<br> I decided not to go back.<br> The air felt good.<br> I must have started to walk.<br> I don't remember.<br> I remember a street sign.<br> I couldn't read it.<br> I don't know how far I walked.<br> It must have been a long way.<br> I don't know what the place looked like<br> on the outside or how I got there...<br> ... but I remember looking up<br> and seeing this girl...<br> ... this Ginny...<br> - What did you say your name was?<br> - Ginny. Because I'm from Virginia.<br> - I sure get tired of it here.<br> - What do you work here for then?<br> For laughs, dear. For laughs.<br> - Every night?<br> - Every night.<br> - To nothing.<br> - Until when?<br> - Till we close.<br> - Then what?<br> Then I sleep. Me and myself<br> in my great big bed. We sleep.<br> - I could have killed my girlfriend. She...<br> - You got that in quick, didn't you?<br> - Drink up and be nice.<br> - You know what I'd like to do?<br> I'd like to take you dancing.<br> - That's what the music's for. I work here.<br> - I mean really take you dancing.<br> The two of us going somewhere...<br> ...eating something,<br> talking about ourselves.<br> - I'm serious.<br> - Sure. I know, I remind you of your sister.<br> You remind me of my wife.<br> Be nice. Order us some more drinks,<br> and then we'll dance.<br> I've had enough to drink.<br> What did you leave for?<br> You didn't wanna drink.<br> You wanted to yap.<br> I don't make any money on that.<br> You're not getting so rich<br> out here all by yourself.<br> - What's wrong with me, anyway?<br> - You're corny.<br> - What did I say? We were just talking.<br> - Oh, is that what that was?<br> "Know what I'd like to do? I'd like to take<br> you dancing. You remind me of my wife."<br> What's the idea<br> saying a thing like that?<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you.<br> I haven't really been dancing<br> in almost two years.<br> Why not?<br> - Because I haven't.<br> - Why?<br> Because I've been working for a living.<br> What do you do when you're not<br> working for a living?<br> I live.<br> How much would you charge to dance<br> with me now? I mean here.<br> It's nice out here.<br> Used to be a spaghetti restaurant.<br> They don't use the garden anymore.<br> - Would you like me to make you spaghetti?<br> - Sure.<br> I live at the Regal Apartments,<br> on Southern Street.<br> You could wait for me.<br> I won't be home for a couple hours...<br> ...but, well, you could sleep or some...<br> I'll try to get away early.<br> But if you don't wanna wait, just lock<br> the door and put the key in the mailbox.<br> It was a crazy thing to do, I guess,<br> but it made sense at the time.<br> Besides, I thought<br> I could use a little sleep.<br> I walked around some more,<br> then I went up to her apartment.<br> First thing I remember was<br> somebody knocking on the door.<br> I couldn't figure out at first where I was.<br> Then when I remembered...<br> ... I couldn't remember<br> whether Ginny had been there or not.<br> - Hasn't she come home yet?<br> - I don't know.<br> I don't think so.<br> - You mean Ginny, don't you?<br> - Who do you mean?<br> I guess I mean Ginny.<br> - You belong here or something?<br> - Or something.<br> - How long have you been waiting?<br> - I don't know, I just woke up.<br> I don't even know what time it is.<br> - I got a key somewhere she gave me.<br> - I know. I saw you with her at the joint.<br> - Who are you?<br> - I'm a man who's waiting for her.<br> Is that all right?<br> Sure.<br> - Want some coffee?<br> - Sure.<br> I'm her husband. I'm Ginny's husband.<br> I was a soldier. I conked out.<br> You're wondering about this setup,<br> aren't you?<br> Yeah, I guess I am.<br> Well, ask her, then.<br> She was a tramp when I married her.<br> I didn't know it at first...<br> ...but I knew it before we married. That's<br> one reason I enlisted, to get away from her.<br> But I couldn't wait to get out<br> and come back to her.<br> When I did, she didn't want me.<br> Funny, isn't it?<br> But I still want her. I still love her.<br> You know what I just told you?<br> That's a lie.<br> - I see.<br> - I'm not her husband.<br> I met her the same as you did,<br> at the joint.<br> I can't keep away from her. I wanna<br> marry her, and she won't have me.<br> - I see.<br> - Do you believe that? Well, it's a lie too.<br> I don't love her,<br> and I don't wanna marry her.<br> She makes good money there.<br> - You got any money on you?<br> - No.<br> She makes good money sometimes.<br> Hey. Do you suppose I could be a soldier?<br> Maybe I could in the regular Army.<br> Make a good rating and make<br> some dough by the next war.<br> - Why not?<br> - Why not?<br> Because I don't want to.<br> What do I wanna be a soldier for?<br> I'm too restless.<br> I don't know what I wanna do.<br> - You gonna wait for her?<br> - I don't know.<br> Well, wait for her if you want to.<br> Soon as we've had some coffee,<br> I'm gonna take a nap.<br> Got any cigarettes?<br> No.<br> I remembered what you said<br> when I left you, Keeley.<br> You said, "Meet me at the hotel<br> at midnight. " I said, "Why?"<br> You said, "Meet me. I wanna show you<br> Washington. It's educational.<br> Maybe you'll learn something.<br> Meet me, or I'll murder you. "<br> Suddenly, the whole thing was screwy.<br> I decided to get out of there.<br> I went straight to the hotel, and next thing<br> I knew, you were pushing me around.<br> How long was it from the time you left<br> Samuels' till the time you met this Ginny?<br> - I don't know...<br> - How long were you in her apartment?<br> - Well, I...<br> - Oh, you ought to be kept in a cage.<br> What's happening? Is everything<br> suddenly gone crazy?<br> I don't mean just this.<br> I mean everything. Or is it just me?<br> Oh, it's not just you.<br> The snakes are loose.<br> Anybody can get them.<br> I get them myself,<br> but they're friends of mine.<br> - I think Samuels understood it.<br> - That's a big help.<br> Are you still in love with your wife or not?<br> I guess I am.<br> - She still in love with you?<br> - That's a screwy thing to ask.<br> Maybe it is, but she's here now.<br> Or she should be.<br> - I gotta figure out how much to tell her.<br> - Mary?<br> Oh, she doesn't know anything.<br> She was coming here anyway.<br> - Why?<br> - To see you.<br> That's why I tried to keep you sober<br> tonight. I talked to her this afternoon.<br> Maybe she's here now.<br> She was supposed to be on a plane.<br> I don't know where she is,<br> but I'll go and try to find her.<br> Keeley, I couldn't have<br> killed that guy, could I?<br> - Leroy found Floyd.<br> - Where?<br> He's in a room on Maryland Avenue<br> where he's hiding out.<br> He phoned Leroy, trying to raise some<br> dough. Leroy says he sounds scared.<br> - You got the address?<br> - I don't want nothing to do with this.<br> - I don't wanna get in trouble.<br> - Just tell us where Floyd is.<br> Then go back to the hotel<br> and stay there and forget it.<br> Don't move, even to another seat.<br> You want a sandwich or something?<br> Okay, watch the picture, then,<br> and don't move.<br> Open up, Floyd. It's Monty.<br> Let me get out of here.<br> What do I have to stay for?<br> We have to be careful now.<br> The cops are screwing down.<br> And that Finlay is sharp.<br> I tried a couple things,<br> but I don't know about him.<br> - We'll be okay. Keep our stories straight.<br> - Give me a cigarette.<br> Let me have a cigarette, huh?<br> Get ahold of yourself.<br> I gotta leave so I can go out<br> and keep in touch with things.<br> - Keep out of sight till they find Mitch.<br> - Let me go away someplace.<br> That won't do no good.<br> You gotta talk to the cops sometime.<br> No, Monty. I can't talk to them.<br> You got nothing to worry about<br> as long as our stories are straight.<br> I can't say there was no argument. Mitch<br> was there when you went after Samuels.<br> - The cops will pick up Mitch...<br> - Mitch won't say nothing. Mitch was stinko.<br> He won't remember exactly.<br> Nobody knows exactly except me and you.<br> Why'd you go after the guy?<br> Why'd you have to start an argument?<br> No Jew is gonna tell me<br> how to drink his stinking liquor.<br> There wasn't no argument.<br> There was just a quiet discussion.<br> We left right after Mitch.<br> Remember that, Floyd. Right after Mitch.<br> - Yeah.<br> - We was worried about him.<br> Sure.<br> Floyd.<br> Floyd, open up, it's Williams.<br> We heard you're in trouble.<br> What's the matter, Floyd?<br> Leroy tells me you're in a jam,<br> you need some dough.<br> We don't like to see anybody in a jam.<br> How much dough do you need?<br> Oh, I talked to Leroy about something else.<br> Got it wrong, I guess.<br> Anyway, I was going away,<br> but now I don't know.<br> Heard about Mitchell?<br> The cops think he killed that man he met<br> with you and Monty. Did you hear about it?<br> Yeah, I heard about it.<br> This has got nothing to do with that.<br> I wasn't there. I left. Me and Monty left.<br> Cops can't pin anything on me and Monty.<br> I got in a jam about something else,<br> Keeley, and it just caught up with me.<br> That's what I need the dough for.<br> I haven't got enough dough on me, but I'll<br> scrounge around, see what I can dig up.<br> Gee, thanks a lot, Keeley.<br> I'll be back before morning.<br> Anybody else know you're here?<br> Leroy and you, unless you told somebody.<br> No, we haven't told anybody.<br> How about Monty?<br> - Monty?<br> - You haven't seen him?<br> No.<br> - He doesn't know you're here?<br> - How would he know?<br> Okay, sit tight.<br> - Monty, I didn't call Keeley up...<br> - I told you not to go out anywhere.<br> You got in touch with Keeley.<br> You shouldn't have done that.<br> No, I didn't get in touch with Keeley.<br> I called Leroy.<br> Leroy must have told him. Criminy,<br> all I did was try to get some dough.<br> You got plenty of dough.<br> You said you'd saved.<br> All I wanna do is go away.<br> Give me some dough.<br> I had everything figured out.<br> Just what we was gonna do.<br> You went out and phoned,<br> and you spoiled everything.<br> I didn't spoil nothing.<br> I told Keeley I hadn't seen you.<br> I told Keeley I knew nothing about you.<br> You heard me say that.<br> Nobody can pin anything on you, Monty.<br> That's right, Floyd.<br> Nobody can pin anything on me.<br> Look, Monty, I'll go to Mexico.<br> I'll never come back.<br> I don't wanna get mixed up in this.<br> I had nothing to do with it.<br> Criminy, you went crazy or something.<br> Samuels didn't do anything to you.<br> - You just went crazy.<br> - I didn't do nothing to Samuels either.<br> Except I flicked him. Like that.<br> Not that hard, maybe.<br> - Stop it, Monty! Monty, stop!<br> - More like that.<br> Monty, stop it! You went nuts!<br> I got nothing against Jews. Monty!<br> Well, I don't like Jews!<br> And I don't like nobody who likes Jew...<br> I'd like to see Captain Finlay.<br> It's important.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Peter Keeley. Sergeant Peter Keeley.<br> Captain Finlay isn't in now.<br> Have a seat, sergeant.<br> Captain Finlay wants to see you now.<br> You're sure he's not too busy?<br> I wouldn't wanna bother him.<br> What happened?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Floyd's dead, sergeant.<br> - Tell him how it happened.<br> - I told you to wait.<br> I did wait. I'm sorry, but I waited.<br> Nobody came in, nobody went out,<br> I still waited outside.<br> Then I thought I'd go up and take a look.<br> There he was, strung up by his necktie.<br> I didn't know what to do. You weren't<br> around. I thought I better call the police.<br> I came two hours ago<br> to tell you I talked to Floyd.<br> If you'd come as soon as you found out<br> where Floyd was...<br> ...I could have talked to him,<br> and he'd still be alive.<br> Now, don't you think you better tell me<br> where Mitchell is, sergeant?<br> - Why?<br> - I don't want anybody else killed.<br> You should start working with me. It's<br> the only way, if you wanna help Mitchell.<br> Because you're in custody.<br> So is Williams.<br> You'll both stay there forever,<br> if necessary.<br> I'll listen to anything constructive<br> you two have to say...<br> ...but I won't stand for<br> any more interference.<br> You've got a mind like a dogcatcher.<br> I'm in custody. Williams is in custody.<br> Everybody's in custody.<br> What does that prove?<br> Except that you've got a big jail.<br> If you want Mitchell,<br> you can go find him.<br> All right.<br> I just hoped there was an easier way.<br> Okay, Dick.<br> Come on, Keeley.<br> I talked to Mitchell a while ago.<br> - Where is he?<br> - I said I talked to Mitchell, captain.<br> He couldn't have killed Samuels.<br> He didn't go back to Samuels' apartment.<br> He went and met a girl.<br> Spent a couple hours in her apartment.<br> - What does that prove?<br> - That he went to a joint and he met a girl.<br> Would a man who has just killed somebody<br> go on the make for some tramp?<br> - And it proves where he was for two hours.<br> - Which two hours?<br> - All you have to do is ask the girl.<br> - Who is she?<br> She's a girl. She calls herself Ginny.<br> Mitch knows where she lives.<br> - When did he tell you all of this?<br> - Before I went to see Floyd.<br> - Did he know where you were going?<br> - Yes.<br> - He could've killed Floyd.<br> - He didn't know the address.<br> He could have followed you.<br> Mary, I'm sorry.<br> Captain Finlay, if Keeley tells you<br> where Mitch is, will you let him go?<br> - Let me talk to Mitch first, by myself.<br> - I won't let Keeley go, no.<br> But you can talk to your husband alone. I'll<br> be waiting for you outside, wherever he is.<br> He's in the balcony<br> of an all-night movie. The Regent.<br> About four blocks from the hotel.<br> Oh, Mitch.<br> - Oh, Mitch.<br> - Mary, darling.<br> - When did you get here?<br> - About 1:00.<br> - They were waiting for me at the airport.<br> - "They"?<br> The police.<br> - Did you see Keeley?<br> - Yes.<br> - What did he say?<br> - He told me what had happened.<br> - Where is he now?<br> - He's in jail.<br> The other boy, Floyd, was killed.<br> Police are waiting downstairs.<br> - We've only got a minute.<br> - No, Mary, listen. I've gotta say this first.<br> Whatever you think...<br> I don't care what Keeley told you.<br> Nothing tonight that happened has<br> anything to do with us or how I feel.<br> - That doesn't matter now.<br> - Yes, it does.<br> You've got to understand.<br> I've been sitting here.<br> I think I have things straight now.<br> I couldn't write to you<br> because I was depressed and jittery.<br> Samuels, the man who I was supposed<br> to have killed tonight, he understood it.<br> I can't explain what he said.<br> But he said a guy like me now, with<br> the war over, could start hating himself.<br> Maybe that's what happened.<br> Maybe I started hating myself because<br> I was afraid of getting going again.<br> Of trying to draw again.<br> Of looking for a job.<br> Of having you waiting all the time,<br> after having waited four years already.<br> It began to be hard for me<br> to think about you.<br> I just couldn't write.<br> Does that make any sense?<br> Yes.<br> Mitch, I wanna go see this girl, Ginny.<br> Why?<br> I wanna see her. If you were in her<br> apartment the time this man was killed...<br> ...the police will be satisfied<br> you didn't do it.<br> Please, I'll be all right.<br> Captain Finlay's going with me.<br> You remember the name of the apartments<br> where she lives, don't you?<br> The Regal Apartments.<br> We'd better go. I told Captain Finlay<br> we wouldn't be too long.<br> Captain Finlay, would you let me<br> try first, by myself?<br> She might tell me more<br> than she'll tell you.<br> All right.<br> - What is it?<br> - Ginny?<br> I'm Mrs. Mitchell.<br> - How's Mr. Mitchell?<br> - My husband's in a great deal of...<br> - What do you want, anyway? It's late.<br> - I wanted to talk to a girl named Ginny.<br> My husband's a soldier<br> that was here tonight.<br> There are no soldiers here now, just me.<br> - I don't have anything to do with soldiers.<br> - Please, wait.<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> It's terribly important.<br> I know it's late, but you've got to help me.<br> Can't I come in for just a minute, please?<br> - My husband's in trouble.<br> - I know nothing about your husband.<br> Why don't you go home.<br> Maybe he's waiting for you.<br> He's in jail. They say that he<br> killed a man, but he didn't.<br> Okay, then there isn't any problem.<br> What do you want from me,<br> a character reference?<br> All I want you to do is to say<br> he was with you tonight.<br> Tonight's a long time ago.<br> I wouldn't be able to remember.<br> - You'd remember Mitch.<br> - Why? He have two heads or something?<br> You danced with him out in back<br> of where you work in a sort of garden.<br> You gave him your key<br> and told him your address.<br> - He told you he was here with me tonight?<br> - Yes.<br> He lied to you. If he was here,<br> I didn't know about it.<br> And I don't know where you got<br> my name and address.<br> I can't tell you anything else.<br> You'd better go now.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I wanna talk to you.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Are you a cop or something?<br> - What's your name?<br> - I don't like cops.<br> Nobody likes cops.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Virginia Tremaine. Why?<br> - Where are you from?<br> - From here.<br> - Before you were from here?<br> - Pennsylvania. Wilkes-Barre. So what?<br> - What do you do?<br> - I work.<br> - Where?<br> - At the Red Dragon.<br> What's wrong about working there?<br> That make me a criminal?<br> Does that give you the right to bust into<br> my house and ask me a lot of questions?<br> Is that where you met Mitchell?<br> That's where I meet a lot of people.<br> I never heard of Mitchell.<br> - You live here alone?<br> - Sure.<br> - Is there something wrong in that?<br> - The police won't hurt you. He promised.<br> - All we want you to do is to tell the truth.<br> - Sit down, Virginia.<br> Now, about Mrs. Mitchell's husband...<br> He's in pretty deep, Virginia.<br> Looks like he killed a man, maybe two.<br> Mrs. Mitchell doesn't think he did,<br> but that's only natural.<br> I know he was here. He told me.<br> That doesn't matter now. Never mind me.<br> - We've got to think of him.<br> - Oh, brother! Listen to that.<br> "Never mind me.<br> We've gotta think of him."<br> Well, isn't that sweet.<br> Isn't that just too sweet.<br> He wasn't here with me.<br> He could have been, but he wasn't.<br> He could have come up.<br> I could've cooked him something, and we<br> could've talked. What's wrong with that?<br> What's the matter with me being<br> with her precious husband? Does he break?<br> And where was she?<br> Where were you when he needed you?<br> Maybe you were someplace having<br> beautiful thoughts. Well, I wasn't.<br> I was in a gin mill, where all he had to do<br> to see me was walk in and buy me a drink.<br> And that's all I know about it.<br> I didn't ask him if he killed anybody.<br> Listen, Virginia...<br> You're not involved in this murder,<br> so nothing will happen to you.<br> - That's the first point. Got it?<br> - You bet I got it.<br> Okay, now. When was...?<br> I mean, what time?<br> This is all a question of time.<br> What time was Mitchell with you<br> at the Red Dragon?<br> We found the body of this man, Samuels,<br> at 10:00. He'd been dead half an hour.<br> So if Mitchell was with you<br> between 9 and 10, he's all right.<br> Was he?<br> Tell me the truth.<br> No.<br> I gave him my key,<br> I don't know, maybe 8:30.<br> I liked him. I felt sorry for him.<br> I was sick of the stinking joint. I was gonna<br> ditch early, only I couldn't get away.<br> I didn't get home till 1, maybe 2.<br> He wasn't here.<br> He'd been and gone. Left the key.<br> - But I don't know what time.<br> - Is that the truth?<br> I said it's the truth. What do you want me<br> to do, light up like a Christmas tree?<br> We're wasting our time.<br> This isn't going to help your husband.<br> He was up here.<br> The soldier you're talking about<br> was up here. I talked to him.<br> Thanks. Who are you?<br> A guy. What does it matter?<br> You wanna know if a soldier...<br> This has nothing to do with you.<br> Mind your own business.<br> - Any man you bring here is my business.<br> - It's not your business to spy...<br> ...watch me like I belong to you,<br> because I don't. I hate your guts!<br> What time? What time was it?<br> He was here when I came. I asked him<br> how long he'd waited. Said he didn't know.<br> I should have thrown him out.<br> I started to make coffee, and he left.<br> - What time did you get here?<br> - Twelve-thirty. Ginny's usually here by then.<br> I'll be glad to help if I can.<br> I'll be here if you need me.<br> You will not. You'll get out right now!<br> She hates me, all right. She sure hates me.<br> I'm a DD. Dishonorable discharge.<br> I was in the Army. I'm her husband.<br> We've been separated, but I still love her.<br> I don't want a divorce.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> We made a lot of plans,<br> but they all fell through.<br> I'll be around if you want me.<br> Where's my wife?<br> Why can't I talk to her?<br> Your wife's all right.<br> I sent her to a hotel.<br> You can't talk to her because you're<br> being held on a murder charge.<br> I didn't murder anyone.<br> Why would I murder him?<br> What motive would I have?<br> Maybe you didn't like him. Maybe you<br> hated him. Hate's a good motive.<br> Why would I hate him? I hardly knew him.<br> I only talked to him for a couple of hours.<br> He seemed like a nice guy.<br> - You knew he was a Jew.<br> - No.<br> - You didn't know he was Jewish?<br> - No, I didn't think about it.<br> What would that have to do with it?<br> What's that got to do with me?<br> I've got Montgomery for you.<br> I'll see him outside. I'm through here,<br> but I wanna talk to Keeley.<br> Here's what you wanted<br> from the War Department on Samuels.<br> He was hit in Okinawa,<br> got a medical discharge last summer.<br> Come on, Mitchell.<br> You wanted to see me, captain?<br> I figured it was important.<br> I wanna help all I can.<br> Sit down, Montgomery.<br> Yes, sir.<br> How did you know that Samuels<br> hadn't been in the Army?<br> What?<br> When I talked to you earlier, you were sure<br> that Samuels had never been in uniform.<br> How'd you know that?<br> Well, like I told you, you could tell.<br> You could see.<br> Those guys got ways<br> of keeping theirselves from getting dirty.<br> - Why'd you ask that, captain?<br> - Oh, I was just curious.<br> - You know who killed him yet?<br> - Yes, I think I do.<br> Is that all? Don't you wanna<br> ask me something else?<br> No, that's all.<br> I can go now?<br> - Oh, Montgomery.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> You haven't seen anything<br> of Floyd Bowers, have you?<br> - No, I haven't. I can't figure that...<br> - Let me know if you do, will you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well...<br> ...Mrs. Finlay will be<br> just about leaving for early Mass.<br> Now that I know that,<br> do you mind if go back to bed?<br> What's the matter? I thought you were<br> gonna have this case solved by now.<br> I'm not doing anything except breathing.<br> You've got Mitchell,<br> your fairy story all written.<br> Drunk, trouble at home,<br> can't tell a clear story. Open and shut.<br> - What's holding you back?<br> - Is that all?<br> That's all.<br> All right, then.<br> Do you really wanna help me<br> wind this up?<br> - I thought you didn't like me.<br> - You talk too much sometimes.<br> - You're appealing to my better side?<br> - Yes.<br> - You're making me a proposition?<br> - Yes.<br> - I'd like to sleep on it.<br> - You can sleep all day when we're finished.<br> Okay, then.<br> I've done a lot of work here tonight.<br> Some of it you know about,<br> some of it you don't.<br> Routine, most of it.<br> I look for motives, as I always do.<br> It's habit from training.<br> But I couldn't find any.<br> I realized the reason I couldn't find<br> an ordinary motive...<br> ...was because none of these men<br> knew Samuels long enough to have one.<br> You usually have to know something<br> about a man to have a reason to kill him.<br> You have to know him well enough<br> to be in love with his wife...<br> ...well enough to know<br> he has some money.<br> Samuels didn't have any money.<br> Didn't even have a wife.<br> That's beside the point. Not one of these<br> men knew that, or anything about him.<br> Mitchell talked to him maybe for an hour.<br> The others, less.<br> So it had to be something else.<br> The motive had to be<br> inside the killer himself.<br> Something he brought with him.<br> Something he'd been nursing<br> for a long time.<br> Something that had been waiting.<br> The killer had to be someone who could<br> hate Samuels without knowing him.<br> Who could hate him enough to kill him,<br> under the right circumstances.<br> Not for any real reason,<br> but mistakenly and ignorantly.<br> The rest wasn't too hard.<br> I looked at my suspects. I thought back<br> over the answers I'd had. Some of them fit.<br> I knew who'd kill Samuels.<br> I should have known right away.<br> But the motive was so simple...<br> ...that it slipped through the machinery.<br> You're smart enough to know<br> what I'm talking about.<br> You don't have to draw me pictures.<br> I know what you mean.<br> I think you're right.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> It'd take months to polish this off<br> the usual way. I've nothing on Montgomery.<br> I might never get anything. I wanna<br> take a long chance on nailing him quick.<br> - How well do you know him?<br> - I tried to like him. Not my type.<br> - Does he have many close friends?<br> - One. Bowers. I think he killed him.<br> - So do I. What about Leroy?<br> - I don't think so. He's in Monty's platoon...<br> - How does he feel about Monty?<br> - You're getting ahead of me.<br> - I was hoping he didn't like him.<br> - He's scared to death of him.<br> Is he as dumb as Monty says?<br> He's kind of young.<br> He doesn't always know which end is up.<br> Monty doesn't think<br> he's smart enough to lie.<br> What if Leroy told Monty a fantastic story?<br> Would Monty believe it?<br> He might.<br> I'll risk it.<br> Keeley's on his way. I don't wanna see<br> anything about Floyd's killing.<br> Not a word. As far as we know,<br> he's still alive. We've never heard of him.<br> I want you to get Leroy without being seen<br> and bring him here. Can you do it?<br> - I can try.<br> - Be back in an hour if you can.<br> I'll talk to your CO<br> and tell him what's up.<br> It isn't that I don't wanna help,<br> it's just... Well, I don't...<br> I've never been around<br> Monty and Floyd much.<br> Monty never wanted me around.<br> He says I'm stupid.<br> I guess I am.<br> How do you know he killed him<br> like you say?<br> - That's what we want you to help us prove.<br> - I don't wanna get in any trouble.<br> You won't. And stop worrying<br> about Monty.<br> Captain Finlay won't let<br> anything happen to you.<br> Maybe you're right, but I can't think he'd<br> do a thing like that without no reason.<br> He thought he had a reason.<br> You know the way Monty feels.<br> You've heard the things he says.<br> Well, yes, I guess I heard him say<br> a couple of times...<br> ...about the Jewish people living off<br> the fat of the land while he was out there.<br> You say that's all lies.<br> I guess it is, but...<br> Look, maybe Monty roughed this guy up<br> a little, and that's all.<br> That was all he started out to do, yes.<br> He didn't have a plan,<br> or anything like that.<br> This business of hating Jews comes<br> in a lot of different sizes.<br> There's the "you can't join<br> our country club" kind...<br> ...and "you can't live around here" kind.<br> Yes, and the "you can't work here" kind.<br> And because we stand for all of these,<br> we get Monty's kind.<br> He's just one guy. We don't get him very<br> often, but he grows out of all the rest.<br> Look, Leroy...<br> ...you know we have a law<br> against carrying a gun?<br> Sure.<br> We have that law<br> because a gun is dangerous.<br> Well, hate, Monty's kind of hate,<br> is like a gun.<br> If you carry it around with you,<br> it can go off and kill somebody.<br> It killed Samuels last night.<br> Sir, I don't feel right<br> getting mixed up in anything.<br> - Don't you see what I mean, major?<br> - Yes, I see what you mean.<br> - Ought I do what Captain Finlay wants?<br> - Well, that's up to you.<br> I can't tell you what to do.<br> This isn't an Army matter.<br> - Monty was in my outfit.<br> - The Army isn't proud of that.<br> The Army has never been proud of men<br> like Montgomery.<br> So don't worry about<br> being disloyal to your outfit.<br> You think, sir, that Monty would<br> kill anybody, like he says?<br> - He might.<br> - He killed Floyd.<br> I hate to think of anything like that<br> happening to Floyd.<br> After going through the Philippines<br> and everything.<br> And I hate to see Monty<br> get away with anything.<br> - But I'm getting out soon, and...<br> - This won't change that.<br> I might get into trouble.<br> I don't see this as any of my business.<br> Leroy...<br> ...has Monty ever<br> made fun of your accent?<br> - Sure, lots of times.<br> - Why?<br> He calls you a hillbilly, doesn't he?<br> Says you're dumb.<br> He laughs at you because you're<br> from Tennessee.<br> He's never even been to Tennessee.<br> Ignorant men always laugh<br> at things that are different.<br> Things they don't understand.<br> They're afraid of things they don't<br> understand. They end up hating them.<br> You get me all mixed up.<br> You know about these things<br> I know nothing about.<br> How do I know what you're trying to do?<br> How do I know you aren't<br> a Jewish person yourself?<br> - Something.<br> - You don't.<br> But would it make any difference?<br> Well...<br> ...all right, Leroy.<br> But I'd like to tell you one more thing.<br> Then you can go, if you want to.<br> About 100 years ago, in Ireland...<br> ...the potato crop failed. It was serious.<br> Lot of the Irish came<br> over here. Immigrants.<br> Their talk was different.<br> Like yours, Leroy.<br> Their religion was different.<br> They were Catholics, most of them.<br> They settled down in different places.<br> They liked it here.<br> One of them I knew about.<br> He'd been a farmer.<br> Stayed in Philadelphia.<br> He worked and saved to buy some land.<br> He thought of himself as<br> just another man living in America.<br> But suddenly one day he looked around<br> and saw that something had happened.<br> It frightened him.<br> Fear and hatred of all Irish Catholics had<br> developed and spread like a terrible disease.<br> He saw that he wasn't<br> an American anymore.<br> He was a dirty Irish Mick.<br> A priest lover. A spy from Rome.<br> A foreigner trying to rob men of jobs.<br> He didn't understand.<br> He didn't know what to do.<br> He didn't do much of anything.<br> He couldn't.<br> But one day, when a bunch of men<br> attacked his parish priest on the street...<br> ...he waded in to help the priest.<br> He managed to get him inside a store.<br> That night, on the way home from work,<br> he stopped off for a beer.<br> When he left the bar...<br> ...two men followed him<br> carrying empty whiskey bottles.<br> They didn't mean to kill him.<br> They were just going to<br> rough him up a little.<br> They didn't start out to kill, they just started<br> out hating. The way Monty started out.<br> But 20 minutes later<br> my grandfather was dead.<br> That's history, Leroy.<br> They don't teach it in school,<br> but it's real American history just the same.<br> Thomas Finlay was killed in 1848 just<br> because he was an Irishman and a Catholic.<br> It happened many times.<br> Maybe that's hard for you to believe,<br> Leroy, but it's true.<br> And last night, Joseph Samuels was killed<br> just because he was a Jew.<br> Do you see any difference, Leroy?<br> Any difference at all?<br> Hating is always the same.<br> Always senseless.<br> One day it kills Irish Catholics,<br> the next day, Jews.<br> The next day, Protestants.<br> The next day, Quakers. It's hard to stop.<br> It can end up killing men<br> who wear striped neckties.<br> Or people from Tennessee.<br> Will you tell me exactly what to say?<br> I'll tell you exactly what to say.<br> - Hiya, Monty.<br> - Hiya.<br> - Heard about everything that happened?<br> - Yeah.<br> Heard they got Keeley and Mitchell<br> and are holding them.<br> Good thing I left the bar when I did,<br> or I'd be mixed up in it too.<br> Floyd didn't have anything to do with it,<br> did he, Monty?<br> - Knock it off.<br> - What's the matter, Monty?<br> Monty, Floyd couldn't have<br> done it, could he?<br> - Floyd wouldn't bump anyone off, would he?<br> - I don't know.<br> He sure was acting funny<br> when I saw him last night, though.<br> - When did you see him?<br> - I saw him after.<br> - After what?<br> - After all that happened.<br> He wants to see you, Monty.<br> He asked me to tell you<br> he wants to see you.<br> Honest. I didn't know<br> whether I ought to tell you.<br> You don't wanna get mixed up in anything<br> more than you are. But he was acting crazy.<br> He gave me a crazy thing to tell you. Said<br> to tell you the necktie wasn't any good.<br> What did he mean by that, Monty?<br> When did you see Floyd, Leroy?<br> How did you happen to see him?<br> He called me and asked me<br> to come over to where he was.<br> Where was he?<br> Some old place up on Maryland Avenue,<br> on the second floor.<br> I wrote down the address.<br> I had it here someplace.<br> He was really acting crazy, Monty.<br> He said you'd give him<br> some money to go away.<br> I must have left it in my room.<br> - Let's see if we can find it, Leroy.<br> - You want to see him?<br> Let's see if we can find the paper<br> you wrote the address on.<br> I had it here someplace.<br> He said not to come today.<br> He wouldn't be there.<br> He said to come tonight before 10:00.<br> That he had to have the money<br> before 10:00.<br> Here it is.<br> Will you go see him, Monty?<br> Will you give him some money?<br> I wouldn't say anything about this, Leroy.<br> I wouldn't say anything<br> about talking to Floyd.<br> - I'd like to talk to Captain Finlay.<br> - He's not here.<br> - Could I talk to Mitchell or Keeley?<br> - They're in custody.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> - My friend Floyd Bowers... You remember.<br> - Yeah.<br> I started him to the hotel<br> like I told Finlay, but I'm worried.<br> He ain't showed up.<br> I thought I should tell Finlay.<br> Well, I'll tell him.<br> - You haven't heard anything about Bowers?<br> - No.<br> What do you want, soldier?<br> - Is Floyd Bowers here?<br> - Who?<br> I must have got the wrong room.<br> This is the second floor, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - They didn't tell me which room it was...<br> ...this friend of mine was in.<br> It must be one of these rooms.<br> Floyd Bowers.<br> You don't know anything about him?<br> You better ask the superintendent.<br> - What's your problem, Montgomery?<br> - I...<br> ...was looking for Floyd Bowers' room.<br> Somebody said he was here.<br> What's Floyd Bowers doing here?<br> I don't know.<br> Somebody said he was here.<br> - Supposed to be on the second floor.<br> - Well, let's see if we can find him.<br> Captain, Montgomery here<br> is looking for Floyd Bowers.<br> What's wrong, captain?<br> Has something happened?<br> Bowers is dead.<br> Dead?<br> Yeah, he was killed here today.<br> - Well, do you know who killed...?<br> - Not yet.<br> How did you know he was here?<br> Last night you didn't know<br> where he was.<br> I didn't then.<br> I didn't know then where he was.<br> Fella back at the hotel<br> told me Floyd was here.<br> Floyd was scared and wanted to talk<br> to me about something. I just come.<br> I don't even know which room it was.<br> I was looking for the right room.<br> He was...<br> ...knocked off in this room, eh?<br> Same guy that knocked off<br> Samuels, maybe.<br> Could be.<br> I liked Floyd, captain.<br> I liked Floyd a lot. I...<br> Naturally, I came here to help him.<br> Fella said he needed money for something.<br> Should've come right away.<br> Well, this fella said that Floyd said<br> not till tonight.<br> I figured if Floyd said that,<br> he must have got a reason.<br> I see.<br> Looks like somebody<br> was stringing you along.<br> Yeah.<br> What was his name...<br> ...this fellow who said Floyd<br> wanted to see you?<br> Look, captain...<br> ...I don't wanna be a pigeon. This fella...<br> - What was his name?<br> Leroy something.<br> He was a friend of Floyd's.<br> - Maybe you remember me mentioning him.<br> - You should have come to me.<br> I asked you to tell me<br> if you heard anything.<br> I did. I went right to the station.<br> I asked for you. I talked to him.<br> He said you wasn't there.<br> What did you tell him?<br> Well, captain, I figured...<br> ...the best thing was to tell him<br> that Floyd hadn't showed.<br> I said I was worried about<br> Floyd not showing up.<br> I figured then that you'd<br> get in touch with me...<br> ...and I could tell you about Floyd<br> wanting to talk to me.<br> I see.<br> - You've never been in this house before?<br> - No.<br> No, I've never been here before.<br> I've never even been<br> in this part of town.<br> I didn't know which room it was except it<br> was on the second floor, like Leroy said.<br> I was looking for the right door.<br> Seems like you have<br> a lot of trouble with doors.<br> First time I met you, you were<br> looking for the right door.<br> But you knew the address,<br> which house to come to.<br> - Sure. Leroy give me the address.<br> - Was it written down on a piece of paper?<br> Yeah.<br> Do you have the piece of paper with you?<br> No, I...<br> - I just looked at it.<br> - Where is it?<br> Well, it's in...<br> ...Leroy's room, I guess. I...<br> I just looked at it. I didn't take it. I...<br> - I left it there.<br> - Is this it?<br> Is this it?<br> - Guess it is.<br> - Then I'll have to arrest you, Montgomery.<br> Why would you arrest me?<br> What would you arrest me for?<br> For the murder of Samuels and Bowers.<br> - You're kidding. I've never been here...<br> - You didn't look at this carefully.<br> This is the address<br> of the house next door.<br> I wrote it down myself.<br> You made a mistake, sergeant.<br> You came to the right house anyway.<br> Montgomery!<br> Montgomery, stop!<br> Well, that's it.<br> - Okay, clean it up.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All right.<br> - Stand back.<br> Captain, is he...? Is he dead?<br> He was dead for a long time.<br> He just didn't know it.<br> - I guess I did the right thing.<br> - The rightest thing you ever did, soldier.<br> Captain.<br> Where's Mitchell's wife?<br> She's with him at the station.<br> You wanna see them?<br> No, I guess not.<br> What about them? Think they're<br> gonna be able to make a go of it now?<br> I think they're gonna be all right.<br> Be a little rugged for a while...<br> ...but I think they'll be all right.<br> - Can I drop you anywhere?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Okay.<br> Well, how about a cup of coffee, soldier?<br> Sure.<br>
