See ya in little bit.<br> Miss Alaska..Ms Louisiana.<br> Bye. care boy.<br> was originally developed as a treatment for cancer.<br> With the onset of HIV, however,<br> we at Avinex Industires began a trial<br> in which we administered AZT to infected lab animals.<br> Initial findings suggested increased CD4 counts,<br> restored T-cell immunity..<br> - Isn't it also true that it had some...<br> Troubleing side effects in animal tests,<br> a significant decrease in the red and white<br> blood cells in the animals?<br> Yes, but its effect on the virus is better than<br> anything else that's been tested.<br> In 64, when AZT was developed for<br> cancer treatment, it was shelved;<br> due to lack of anti cancer efficacy and toxicity.<br> We believe those problems were dosage based.<br> So, you're conducting another animal study?<br> Actually, the FDA has given us permission<br> to go straight to human trials..<br> ...which is what brings me here today.<br> We're conducting a double-blind,<br> placebo-controlled randomized trial..<br> ..throughout the United States.<br> Dallas Mercy is one of the proposed sites.<br> How long do you see the study going on?<br> We're hoping to fast track it..<br> ... within a year?<br> During which time the hospital and its administering<br> physicians will be very well compensated for their efforts.<br> Sadly, the AIDS crisis will only<br> get worse before it gets better.<br> And, I know I speak for everyone<br> at Aven Exem when I say,<br> This is a unique opportunity.<br> A chance to be on the forefront in finding a cure.<br> Does it not drive you just a little bit crazy<br> to see these guys talking about;<br> curing the sick<br> while they're flashing gold Rolexes?<br> What do they know about sick patients?<br> - They're a big pharma reps, not doctors.<br> And like it or not,<br> this is a business.<br> How the hell did they get permission<br> to go straight to human trials?<br> People are desperate.<br> You know, People are dying.<br> There is nothing else out there.<br> Fuck!<br> I need to see Dr. Sevard.<br> Dr. Sevards not here today.<br> I can't wait till tomorrow.<br> If you'll tell me what the problem is<br> maybe, I can help you.<br> You wanna know the list of my problems?<br> My lungs bleeding, my skin crawling,<br> there's a fucking jackhammer in my head<br> and thats the least of my fucking problems lady.<br> Mr. Woodroof?<br> - No, no..no...no.<br> I dont want no nurse.<br> I want a doctor.<br> I want a goddamn doctor!<br> NOW!<br> Well..How can I help you?<br> - Are you fuckin' deaf, lady?<br> No. I'm a fucking doctor!<br> If you want to discuss your list of problems,<br> you can meet me in my office in twenty minutes.<br> Okay?<br> I like your style, Doc.<br> Mr.Woodroof.<br> Can you get me AZT?<br> I know the Avinex industries,<br> just released it for testing, right?<br> I wanna buy some,<br> now.<br> That isnt how it works.<br> For about a year, a group of patients will<br> either get the drug or a placebo,<br> Its totally left up to chance,<br> not even the doctors are allowed to know.<br> Who you give..<br> .. dyin people sugar pills?<br> Its the only way to know if a drug works.<br> Can you get some for me?<br> I got cash.<br> I can go a month..<br> ..a week. However you wanna do.<br> - I hear you.<br> Unfortunately, no.<br> But, when it's proven to work and..<br> ...if you fit the profile,<br> then yes.<br> So, youre tellin me Im as good as a horse,<br> being held for dog food..huh?<br> Okay.<br> How about this stuffs, overseas..huh?<br> In Germany, they got this..<br> Dextran Sulfate.<br> Alright, they got this DDC in France,<br> It's suppose to keep the healthy cells you got.<br> From getting, the HIV.<br> They got AL 721 over in Israel...<br> How can i get some of this?<br> None of those drugs have<br> been approved by the FDA.<br> Screw the FDA,<br> Im gonna be DOA.<br> What..I gotta..<br> ... sue this hospital to get my medicine?<br> - Mr. Woodroof, I assure you,<br> that would be a waste of precious time.<br> There is a support group that meets daily,<br> at Draddy Auditorium.<br> I suggest, you try it out.<br> Maybe, talk about your feelings<br> and your concerns...<br> Im dying.<br> What're you tellin me<br> to go get a hug from a bunch of faggots?<br> Good day.<br> Hey! Neddie Jay,<br> get me a shot of Cactus and a buck back.<br> Goddamn.<br> It's hard to say,<br> how much I missed your all ugly mugs.<br> What do you say Clinto, where you hangin<br> ..your pants lately today?<br> Get me another beer,<br> will you, sweetheart?<br> What the fuck, did you say?<br> I said grab me a cold one,<br> Sugarcake.<br> You askin me to kick yer ass?<br> Nah, wouldn't wanna get none of that<br> faggot blood on me.<br> Hey, come on.<br> - Fucker!<br> No..no, I'm alright.<br> That motherfucker is the fucking problem.<br> What the fuck is your problem, man?<br> Hey Ron, I dont want no trouble, alright?<br> Fuck you all!<br> Fuck, all of y'all!<br> Fuckin' goddamn it.<br> He spit on my face.<br> Can I get a fuckin' soap?<br> - Get me a towel...please. c'mon.<br> Fucking Christ!<br> As I stand here tonight,<br> clinical trials are underway..<br> with an eye toward fast-tracking AZ and making it available<br> for the public as soon as possible.<br> In short, I'm happy to say that help<br> may finally be on the way.<br> How long before the drug is approved?<br> The FDA standard procedure to approve<br> a new drug is eight to twelve years.<br> Hey, It's your first time right?<br> - Back the fuck off Tinkerbell.<br> I'll knock your teeths off.<br> You goddamn <br> But, we need it now!<br> It may help, Hell..we'll take the chance!<br> What about dextran sulfate?!<br> We're working closely with the FDA<br> to make sure every effort is made to fast track..<br> It's both our job and the FDA's<br> to make sure the drug is safe -<br> Forget it, we can get it in Mexico.<br> I just need to slow it down a little.<br> Get me down and catch my breath, will you?<br> I ain't ready to crawl into a corner.
