                        I don't mean to hurry you.<br> The prime minister did ask...<br> to see you at once.<br> He doesn't have long, sir.<br> It's all right. I'm on my way.<br> - Stephen.<br> - See you later.<br> Dr. Fleming, Prime Minister.<br> Ah, Stephen.<br> - Welcome.<br> - Good afternoon, sir.<br> I owe you a debt of gratitude...<br> from what I'm told.<br> Thank you.<br> You saw off<br> this backbench rebellion...<br> over the finance bill.<br> Rebels went in breathing fire.<br> Then they came out...<br> purring like lambs.<br> That's not quite true.<br> How did you do it?<br> Same time tomorrow, Raymond.<br> Very well, sir.<br> Good night.<br> I'm sure she's very nice.<br> They all are.<br> Very funny.

Don't make me feel bad.<br> It's been hectic at the paper.<br> Lovely to see you.<br> You must be Anna.<br> Anna Barton, my mother.<br> How are you?<br> Come on through.<br> Hello, Sally. Hi.<br> What are you doing here?<br> This is<br> my horrible little sister.<br> Lunch is all ready.<br> We're only here for a drink.<br> We can't stop for lunch.<br> Say hello to your father.<br> Hi, Dad. This is Anna.<br> My father.<br> Let's have a drink,<br> and I'll show you around.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> Have you been all right?<br> Yes, mostly.<br> Tied up a lot<br> with the children's home.<br> It's turning into a proper job.<br> People ask me to do things.<br> I find it difficult to say no.<br> Is she all right?<br> She hasn't said anything.<br> Are we going to go around<br> the garden all day?<br> We have to go.<br> Thank you for the drink.<br> Not at all.<br> It's always nice<br> to meet Martyn's friends.<br> It was lovely.<br> It was nice to see you, Ma.<br> Bye.<br> It was funny.<br> The great joke was<br> he didn't spot it at auction.<br> It was staring him in the face.<br> It was Delft.<br> He would have thrown it away.<br> Thank you, Tommy.<br> - I'm off to London.<br> - See you later.<br> Miss Snow here.<br> My name's Anna Barton.<br> I'm a friend of the minister's.<br> I was wondering<br> if I could have a word.<br> Hold on.<br> I'll see if the minister's here.<br> A Miss Barton for you.<br> Put her through.<br> It's Anna.<br> Give me your address.<br> I'll be there in an hour.<br> Raymond.<br> Mind you,<br> hysteria is perfectly treatable.<br> I'm not very pleased about it.<br> We'll get the bill through.<br> No doubt about that.<br> We've got some worried masters.<br> Excuse me, Dr. Fleming.<br> This is a rare pleasure.<br> I was hoping<br> we might have a word.<br> Over here.<br> I've got a new job.<br> I've been made<br> the deputy political editor.<br> That's wonderful.<br> Already?<br> I know.<br> That's extraordinary.<br> You got it so young.<br> I know.

We must.<br> Nothing too rich.<br> That's very safe.<br> Here they come.<br> Welcome the hero.<br> Hello, Grandpa.<br> Congratulations.<br> Well done.<br> You don't know Edward.<br> My grandfather.<br> Gracious.<br> Is this your new friend?<br> I'm honored.<br> I've read all about you.<br> Please. Mine was<br> a very overrated career.<br> Let's face it,<br> we look to Stephen.<br> I'm afraid it was me that<br> forced him into politics...<br> me and Ingrid, at least.<br> I don't think he'd have<br> chosen the life himself.<br> What will you drink?<br> Champagne.<br> Champagne, indeed.<br> Well done.<br> Well done in every respect.<br> I was brought up abroad.<br> My father was a diplomat.<br> We almost never lived here.<br> My mother's sort of...<br> She's very French.<br> And now,<br> she's with her fourth husband...<br> and lives in Palm Springs.<br> Palm Springs? Good gracious.<br> So it was quite<br> an odd childhood.<br> We moved about, yes.<br> The Argentine, Africa.<br> For a long time,<br> we were in Rome.<br> Then, I don't know,<br> I moved to Paris.<br> I wanted to be free.<br> I even had a spell<br> as a waitress.<br> When you're young...<br> Then I'd ended a relationship.<br> I moved to England<br> about three years ago.<br> You live by yourself?<br> Do you see your mother?<br> It's turning into a grilling.<br> Not at all.<br> Anna's here to have a good time.<br> But I am.<br> Were you an only child?<br> I had a brother.<br> Anna's brother died.<br> He killed himself when I was 15.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - How old was he?<br> - Sixteen.<br> Did you see his body?<br> What was it like?<br> Rough.<br> Why did he kill himself?<br> Love.<br> I've got to go back<br> to the office.<br> I've got work to finish.<br> Could I have the bill?<br> Thank you<br> for such a lovely evening.<br> Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, everyone.<br> I don't trust her.<br> Don't worry. I don't think<br> it's anything serious.<br> I'll take the car.<br> You go home with Raymond.<br> I've got to go vote.<br> See you.<br> How's that tummy?<br> Full.<br> Will you be all right?<br> I'll be all right.<br> Sleep well.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> We've got to find<br> a structure for this.<br> All through dinner, I just...<br> I wanted to touch you.<br> I wanted to hold you.<br> You must never worry.<br> I'll always be there.<br> Who are you?<br> Tell me about Aston.<br> My brother and I?<br> We were always together.<br> Every few years,<br> there was a new country...<br> or there was<br> a new language to learn...<br> so, of course, Aston and I<br> grew closer and closer.<br> We had nothing else,<br> just each other.<br> I loved him...<br> but he couldn't face the fact<br> that I was going to grow up.<br> He couldn't let go of me.<br> He wanted me all for himself...<br> so it's made me terrified<br> of any kind of possessiveness.<br> You see...<br> if you can imagine...<br> the worst thing<br> that could happen ever...<br> in the whole of your life...<br> well, that happened to me.<br> My brother<br> killed himself over me.<br> I had to decide.<br> I made up my mind because<br> I could have gone under...<br> but I wasn't going to.<br> Remember...<br> damaged people are dangerous.<br> They know they can survive.<br> Listen.<br> I'm going to Brussels<br> this weekend for a conference.<br> Come with me.<br> I'm spending the weekend<br> with Martyn.<br> You know I'll do anything.<br> I've shown you.<br> Please let it be.<br> Don't change it.<br> Morning, my dear.<br> You all right?<br> Very much so.<br> Are you all packed?<br> Raymond's out there.<br> You two be all right<br> on your own?<br> I expect so.<br> You can always call Martyn...<br> get him to come over.<br> Didn't I tell you?<br> They're going to Paris.<br> Paris?<br> I told you it was serious.<br> The Lutetia Hotel.<br> In my experience...<br> people only go to Paris<br> for one thing.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll tell you what that is.<br> We don't need to know.<br> Are you off?<br> Without a kiss?<br> I'll see you Monday.<br> I'll get breakfast on the plane.<br> Gentlemen,<br> it is 5:00 in the morning.<br> It is clear we'll get<br> no further agreement.<br> Therefore,<br> I would like to suggest...<br> a resumption<br> after a short time...<br> School's out.<br> to rethink our position<br> after some much-needed sleep.<br> The meeting is now adjourned.<br> Thank God for that...<br> I think I'll walk.<br> Are you sure?<br> Absolutely.<br> See Brussels at dawn.<br> Come on.<br> Really. I need the exercise.<br> It's up to you.<br> See you later.<br> La gare, s'il vous plait,<br> pour Paris.<br> Hotel Lutetia, bonjour.<br> Mademoiselle Barton,<br> s'il vous plait.<br> Mademoiselle Barton?<br> Elle est avec<br> un Monsieur Fleming.<br> C'est pour Mademoiselle Barton.<br> Turn left outside the hotel.<br> Take the first street<br> on the left.<br> Go to the end.<br> I'll be by the church.<br> Bien. Merci.<br> I love you.<br> I know.<br> I can't see past you.<br> I think<br> you've never seen much at all.<br> I have to go back.<br> He's still asleep.<br> Don't follow us... please.<br> Hotel Lutetia, bonjour.<br> I would like a room for the day.<br> For one person?<br> Et une petit dejeuner...<br> Des oeufs de jambon...<br> du cafe, du pain,<br> des croissants.<br> Et aussi, s'il vous plait...<br> une bonne bouteille<br> de vin rouge.<br> Look who's here. How are you?<br> Brussels all right?<br> I was bringing Raymond in<br> for some breakfast.<br> He had to meet me so early.<br> I can do without.<br> I'll do anything for you.<br> Who's that?<br> His name is Henry.<br> He slept over this weekend.<br> Sally's in love.<br> In love?<br> That's the last time<br> I leave this house.<br> Check the mark.<br> It is.<br> Will you hand me that?<br> - Hold on.<br> - This one?<br> There's a call for you on three.<br> "Seven-three-one"?<br> That's the one.<br> I need to see you.<br> Of course.<br> At lunchtime.<br> Where?<br> Somewhere public.<br> Oh, my God. Again?<br> It's not what you're thinking.<br> It's a different matter.<br> It's difficult to explain<br> over the phone.<br> I'll tell you more<br> when I see you.<br> I'll call you back later.<br> All right.<br> Would you sign these for me?<br> Certainly.<br> I brought some sandwiches.<br> I thought it was going<br> to be a nice day.<br> I've been thinking<br> about what we should do.<br> Do?<br> I have to leave Ingrid.<br> There's no doubt about that.<br> It's the right thing<br> for everybody.<br> I can't go on...<br> not like this.<br> What happened in Paris...<br> The way I behaved.<br> I've never had feelings<br> like this.<br> I have to get them<br> into some sort of...<br> order.<br> I know it'll be hard for Martyn.<br> He's fond of you.<br> He loves me.<br> I know, but he's young.<br> He'll get over it.<br> He's your son.<br> He'd hate you.<br> He'd hate me for a while, but...<br> You'd lose him.<br> You'd lose your own son?<br> You'd also destroy the life<br> you've made with Ingrid.<br> It's a good life.<br> What you say doesn't make sense.<br> How come you're so sure?<br> Because in your heart,<br> you don't even want it.<br> You want us to start<br> eating breakfast together?<br> I'd like that.<br> You'd like it<br> if we lived in the same house...<br> read the papers together?<br> What would you gain<br> if you left Ingrid?<br> I'd gain you.<br> You'd be gaining something<br> you already have.<br> When can you see me?<br> Thursday.<br> Thursday at five o'clock.<br> I feel very optimistic<br> about these new developments.<br> We set some new targets<br> in the area of industrial waste.<br> These are not just talk.<br> These are targets which are<br> sensible and realistic.<br> Are you saying<br> that some serious commitments...<br> actually emerged<br> from the Brussels talks?<br> Brussels was good.<br> It laid out a European agenda.<br> We have to face the fact<br> that toxic waste...<br> is no respecter<br> of national frontiers.<br> Problems such as acid rain,<br> ocean pollution...<br> the diminishing ozone layer...<br> cannot be tackled<br> by one country on its own.<br> There must be cooperation...<br> between the member states<br> of the community.<br> Are you really trying<br> to make out...<br> that for once Britain<br> isn't dragging its heels?<br> I don't think we ever were.<br> It's an image<br> we became saddled with...<br> but when is an image<br> ever the truth?<br> That was pretty good.<br> Don't tell me you were watching.<br> Of course.<br> I never miss a performance.<br> You are extraordinary.<br> So are you.<br> It's a real gift.<br> Being good at things.<br> Somehow I remember<br> what I first saw in you...<br> when you were a doctor...<br> doing simple things well.<br> I do love that.<br> I still love that.<br> I was expecting you.<br> Please come on in.<br> Do you know Peter Wetzlar?<br> I don't.<br> This is Martyn's father.<br> Peter stopped by.<br> He lives in Paris.<br> What brings you to London?<br> The museum.<br> What particular field?<br> Chinese artifacts.<br> The Han dynasty.<br> He hasn't changed.<br> He never warns you when<br> he's going to drop by.<br> I didn't know<br> until the last moment...<br> so I'm riding my luck,<br> as usual.<br> I'll go and get your book.<br> I'm sorry?<br> Stephen's come around<br> for this book.<br> It's out of print.<br> I won't be a moment.<br> I put it aside.<br> You know Anna well?<br> I mean...<br> we've been through<br> quite a lot together.<br> She's still my best friend,<br> I guess.<br> I liked your son.<br> You met him?<br> In Paris.<br> It was important, I think,<br> for Anna.<br> How do you mean?<br> You know how it is.<br> You feel you have to bring<br> all the bits together.<br> I don't think I quite<br> know how you mean.<br> She's getting<br> pretty serious with Martyn.<br> She loves him.<br> I'm sure<br> it's a very good thing...<br> because he seems to know<br> how to handle her...<br> to give her the freedom<br> she really needs.<br> I never could.<br> I see.<br> So perhaps she'll be happy.<br> God knows she deserves it.<br> She does.<br> - What's the book?<br> - Book?<br> You came to pick up a book.<br> It's just something I...<br> Here it is.<br> Thank you.<br> This is it.<br> I couldn't get it.<br> Have it for as long as you like.<br> Thank you.<br> I won't intrude any longer.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to bust in.<br> Not at all.<br> Very nice to meet you.<br> Nice meeting you.<br> I hope we all see you sometime.<br> Thank you for the book.<br> What was that all about?<br> Who is that man?<br> I was with Peter<br> the night Aston died.<br> Peter's someone<br> I'll know forever.<br> Our parents were friends.<br> We'd had the same life.<br> One evening,<br> he took me out dancing.<br> I was 15.<br> Peter brought me home<br> in his car...<br> and he started to kiss me.<br> I didn't know Aston<br> was watching.<br> Aston was watching<br> from a window upstairs.<br> When I went in,<br> he started to go mad.<br> "You'll let him fuck you.<br> They're all going to," he said.<br> "It's the end for us."<br> He came to my room.<br> He wanted to sleep in my bed.<br> All I knew was<br> I had to get him out.<br> I locked the door.<br> I heard him outside.<br> He started imploring me,<br> begging me...<br> saying he was sorry,<br> would I forgive him?<br> I just listened.<br> For hours, I listened.<br> Then it stopped.<br> I went to sleep.<br> Next morning, I woke, and...<br> I heard crying.<br> I went down the corridor.<br> They all told me not to go in,<br> but I did...<br> and I saw Aston.<br> He'd cut his wrists.<br> I took his head in my arms.<br> His face had been<br> under the water...<br> and the water was red.<br> They said we had to leave.<br> They took me and my mother<br> to stay with Peter's parents.<br> They wanted us out of the house.<br> Peter was waiting.<br> He took me upstairs.<br> My nightdress was still<br> covered with blood.<br> It was then...<br> I had to. I knew I had to.<br> I asked him to fuck me.<br> "Fuck me," I said.<br> It's all right.<br> I don't mind her being there.<br> I really don't mind.<br> It's just...<br> I wish Martyn had asked us.<br> Suddenly she seems to be part<br> of our lives, which is fine.<br> It's just this weekend.<br> It's Hartley, which Martyn knows<br> is my favorite place on Earth...<br> and it's my birthday.<br> It makes me sound mean,<br> which I hate.<br> I don't know.<br> She brings out the worst in me.<br> Don't worry. It'll be fine.<br> This is a portrait of Ingrid's<br> great-great-grandmother.<br> Was Ingrid brought up here?<br> Of course.<br> There have been Lloyds here<br> for over 200 years.<br> Ingrid's my only child,<br> so it falls now to Martyn.<br> Martyn and his family<br> will inherit this place.<br> Meanwhile, I'm by myself.<br> That's why these weekends<br> are so wonderful.<br> Grandpa!<br> I assume you'll be back many<br> times and always be welcome.<br> Won't she, Ingrid?<br> Thank you, darling.<br> This is the most<br> extraordinary place.<br> You're not convinced?<br> I was always made to come here<br> for the holidays.<br> That isn't fair.<br> While, of course,<br> the company was fine...<br> I should hope.<br> my childhood<br> wasn't all wonderful.<br> Really?<br> As a matter of fact, it wasn't.<br> Perhaps... I don't know,<br> perhaps it was...<br> Perhaps it was too perfect...<br> nothing was to disturb<br> the surface of things.<br> Everything was fine...<br> no questions.<br> It isn't healthy.<br> That's all I'm saying.<br> It's not a big issue.<br> But it's good to have roots.<br> But roots aren't that great...<br> unless something else<br> comes with them.<br> - Like what?<br> - I don't know.<br> Warmth, I suppose.<br> Passion.<br> It was probably my fault.<br> It came more from Dad,<br> if I have to name anyone.<br> They make a wonderful couple,<br> don't they?<br> Granddad.<br> Good night, you old devil.<br> You'll sleep well in this room.<br> It's one of my favorites.<br> Right, now concentrate.<br> Put your arm here,<br> hand on there, and look there...<br> and look up.<br> Close.<br> Come on here.<br> Had a good walk?<br> Who's winning?<br> I think Martyn<br> is winning everything.<br> This house was full...<br> It was full every weekend.<br> There we are.<br> I thought Bob Marley was dead.<br> Of course he's dead.<br> Then why...<br> Ingrid's mother<br> loved entertaining.<br> Happy birthday.<br> Politicians, of course,<br> and artists came, writers also.<br> Boundless hospitality!<br> My wife understood that.<br> Life's pretty empty without her.<br> That's why I'm so pleased...<br> I'm so pleased for both of you.<br> Am I going too far?<br> Not yet, but you may soon.<br> I doubt it.<br> Come along,<br> I think we've all guessed.<br> I assumed that's why you brought<br> Anna along.<br> Please!<br> Can't you see you're<br> embarrassing Martyn and Anna?<br> Not at all. Far from it.<br> Since Grandfather has said...<br> I've just asked Anna<br> to marry me...<br> and I'm pleased to say<br> she said yes.<br> Oh, my God.<br> It's really marvelous.<br> We both think that's wonderful.<br> Congratulations, my dear.<br> Thank you. It's very sudden.<br> We're taken aback.<br> But you're pleased?<br> Of course.<br> Delighted.<br> I do mean for both of you.<br> Congratulations...<br> I'm sorry.<br> Clumsy. All right.<br> I was always sure<br> you two had this in mind.<br> I'm pleased I've hastened<br> the announcement.<br> You have.<br> Let's drink a toast.<br> Come on, children...<br> to Martyn and Anna.<br> When did you ask?<br> When did you ask Anna?<br> It was a few days ago.<br> She accepted straight-away?<br> I know I've hurt you.<br> All that stuff<br> at dinner last night.<br> I don't know what that was.<br> It's all right.<br> The funny thing is that today<br> I feel very close to you.<br> Heads or tails?<br> Tails.<br> Tails.<br> And Mum...<br> I know I'm hurting her, but...<br> whoever I married,<br> it was going to be hard.<br> I can tell<br> she's worried about Anna.<br> I think she's worried<br> you're taking on a lot.<br> But you have to see that<br> that's why I'm drawn to her.<br> There's a sadness... in her.<br> I don't know why,<br> but it's very interesting.<br> I've discovered I can help her,<br> and that's great.<br> It's the best feeling.<br> Makes you sound like a nurse.<br> I'm not trying to stop you.<br> I like Anna.<br> I really do...<br> but are you sure<br> she's really what you want?<br> You don't know her.<br> There's a whole side to her...<br> that's only there<br> when we're alone.<br> If you could see that,<br> then you'd feel differently.<br> When we're alone,<br> she's like no one else.<br> Sir, I tried to find<br> all the people you asked for.<br> I hope so.<br> - Sir, will you need me?<br> - I need everybody.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> Do you know<br> what I think of that?<br> Sir, before we start,<br> I'd like to apologize...<br> This is supposed to be<br> a final draft...<br> a ministry position paper...<br> and it's full<br> of major factual errors.<br> But what really irritates me<br> is that I'm the one...<br> who has to stand up<br> in Parliament...<br> and if I've been<br> wrongly briefed...<br> then it's me<br> that gets it in the neck.<br> It's all very well for you lot.<br> You shelter behind the woodwork.<br> You wander in here and say...<br> "Sorry, we slipped up<br> on the ozone figures..."<br> but it's my job!<br> Has that occurred to you?<br> If I hadn't spotted<br> your ball's up...<br> then my job<br> would've been on the line.<br> Do you know that?<br> You're redrafting?<br> - Already.<br> - Good.<br> That's it. I'm done.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Good evening.<br> Where's your mother?<br> Work, I suppose.<br> I haven't seen her.<br> No Henry tonight?<br> Sal... I wanted a word.<br> You know when I saw you<br> at Hartley the other night...<br> on the stairs?<br> I'd had to talk to Anna.<br> That's what I was doing.<br> Your mum's a bit upset.<br> You've probably sensed that.<br> And...<br> I was trying to bring<br> all the parties together.<br> I'm going to bed.<br> Oh, dear. Not a bit.<br> I just love it.<br> Would you at least choose<br> the music for the wedding?<br> You should.<br> I suppose so.<br> She doesn't trust me, though.<br> I'm so sorry I'm late.<br> That's all right.<br> - We started without you.<br> - Good.<br> Mrs. Prideaux,<br> welcome to London.<br> Thank you. How do you do?<br> How are you?<br> I was just saying I am<br> so thrilled at this occasion.<br> Thrilled for Anna, of course.<br> One way or another...<br> I haven't seen<br> much of her lately...<br> so it always moves me<br> so much when I do.<br> Thank you.<br> And one look at Martyn...<br> - My goodness.<br> - I know.<br> I feel flattered.<br> Though, of course,<br> he's not Anna's usual type.<br> I'm sorry?<br> If I may say that.<br> Anna's first boyfriend<br> did set a sort of pattern...<br> tormented, difficult.<br> And all the others<br> have followed from there.<br> Are you talking about Peter?<br> I've met him.<br> He seems very nice.<br> He is.<br> I miss him.<br> Mother, everything's fine.<br> How's the salmon?<br> Good.<br> When Peter and Anna broke up...<br> Peter got married<br> to a brilliant young lawyer...<br> a striking-looking girl...<br> but it only lasted eight weeks.<br> I can't boast.<br> My own record<br> isn't much better than that.<br> You've been married a few times?<br> Good Lord!<br> And one nearly in Reno.<br> We went as far<br> as the Chapel of Love...<br> and then I got cold feet.<br> Thank goodness. Otherwise,<br> it would have been five.<br> Of course, it's hard for us.<br> I'm sure Anna has told you.<br> Told us?<br> About the brother she had.<br> Of course, it strikes me.<br> It had to strike me,<br> looking at Martyn.<br> He does look<br> so like Anna's brother.<br> I don't know<br> if you realized that.<br> Not, of course,<br> that Aston was as handsome.<br> Why do you always<br> make it worse for me?<br> Do you think<br> it isn't bad enough?<br> Do you think I constantly<br> need to be reminded?<br> I'm sorry, I'm sure.<br> Perhaps this is why<br> we shouldn't meet.<br> It's all right.<br> Really, it's fine.<br> I think I made a bad impression.<br> I'm afraid your wife<br> didn't look very pleased.<br> I was nervous.<br> That was the trouble.<br> It was fine, really.<br> We both enjoyed meeting you.<br> But I'm not nervous now.<br> You must realize,<br> this is a chance for Anna.<br> At last, with Martyn,<br> she has a chance.<br> She can make a new life.<br> It would be too bad<br> if anything prevented her.<br> I'm not sure I understand<br> what you mean.<br> I think you do.<br> I watched you<br> throughout the meal.<br> You can't even look at her.<br> You must get out of the way.<br> I'm asking you.<br> Please.<br> I won't speak of this again.<br> Thank you.<br> The ministry, sir?<br> Just drive around for a while.<br> I need to get out.<br> I won't be a minute.<br> It's me. Don't say anything.<br> I don't want you<br> to say anything.<br> I have to let you go.<br> It's the right thing to do<br> for Martyn and for you.<br> We both know<br> it's the right thing.<br> It's got to stop.<br> I am sorry.<br> - To the ministry now, sir?<br> - City Road.<br> Do you know where I can find<br> Martyn Fleming?<br> Over here.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'll tell him you're here.<br> Why don't you have it?<br> May I?<br> Are you sure?<br> What brings you here?<br> Sentiment.<br> Feeling...<br> that I haven't behaved<br> as I should.<br> You know what you were saying<br> in Hartley about... passion?<br> You were right.<br> I was distant.<br> I know I was.<br> I thought<br> you could control life...<br> but it's not like that.<br> There are things you...<br> There are things<br> you can't control.<br> That's right.<br> Somehow you know that.<br> I came to wish you both<br> good luck.<br> Are these for me?<br> I really appreciate this.<br> It's very kind. Thank you.<br> The piece doesn't fit,<br> that's the problem.<br> We need something out...<br> Sorry. I see.<br> I love all this.<br> I think it's wonderful.<br> I love all this.<br> You're still there.<br> Everyone's here.<br> We're just about to go in.<br> I'm sorry.<br> We're struggling<br> with this redrafting.<br> Everybody's here...<br> Donald, Trevor...<br> We've got to get it done<br> tonight.<br> I'll keep your food hot.<br> Fine.<br> I'll get back as quick as I can.<br> I just heard from Edward.<br> He says the word is they're<br> going to offer you Health.<br> That means<br> you'd be in the cabinet.<br> When did this happen?<br> It was rumored<br> a couple days ago.<br> What will you say?<br> I don't know.<br> I really don't know anything.<br> Why?<br> Because...<br> Because what?<br> Maybe it's what you always say.<br> Maybe I just don't<br> want to get to the top.<br> Is that all?<br> I can't explain.<br> It's all right. I'll get it.<br> It's nobody.<br> This has just come up for you.<br> It's been passed by security.<br> They've put it through<br> the machine. It's quite safe.<br> Excuse me.<br> I have to go out for a while.<br> I'll be back as soon as I can.<br> Beautiful wedding cakes.<br> - Wedding cakes.<br> - You look at those.<br> Now...<br> You look at<br> the banqueting brochures...<br> and I'll look at plum-duff.<br> Cheers.<br> Your mother should be<br> choosing the caterers.<br> She's happy to leave it to us.<br> And the church.<br> She's had enough.<br> She said she's tried them all.<br> No one service is better<br> than any one else.<br> I suppose she should know,<br> if anyone.<br> But you know,<br> Stephen and I know St. Anselms.<br> We do?<br> The groom's father.<br> Good evening.<br> We were just discussing<br> the wedding.<br> We're not having<br> a white wedding...<br> as I've already<br> moved in with Anna.<br> Come on. You said<br> we'd go through the guest list.<br> I will as long as I can<br> weed it out.<br> Of course.<br> It's actually quite fun.<br> Do you think<br> I would have married Martyn...<br> if I couldn't be with you?<br> I'm coming.<br> Hi, Jenny.<br> We've done everything we can.<br> As soon as possible.<br> Couldn't be too soon for us.<br> Everything<br> will be fine tomorrow.<br> How's Rachel?<br> It's Martyn.<br> Can I speak to Anna?<br> I'm afraid she's left.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> Come on.<br> Miss Barton<br> was to marry your son?<br> You were here in the flat?<br> Your son didn't know...<br> He didn't know<br> of your relationship?<br> You sure?<br> You were careful?<br> We were careful.<br> Where did Miss Barton go?<br> Sir?<br> Do you know why she left?<br> Do you have any comment<br> to make at this time?<br> Have you got a statement<br> for us, please, sir?<br> Come on.<br> Stay right behind the line<br> of the gate, please.<br> There are people living here.<br> How are you feeling now?<br> What does your wife think, sir?<br> What have you done?<br> The pain was unbearable.<br> I was beating myself.<br> The owner of the flat<br> called at the mews...<br> to give Anna instructions<br> on how to work the boiler.<br> It just happened<br> that Martyn was there.<br> He'd never heard of the flat.<br> Never heard of it.<br> He took the address.<br> It was chance.<br> Why didn't you kill yourself?<br> You should have killed yourself<br> when it began.<br> Didn't you know?<br> You thought you could go on?<br> Every day into the future?<br> Go on betraying us both<br> every day?<br> You are not an evil man.<br> You should have killed yourself<br> when you first realized...<br> and then I would have<br> been able to mourn.<br> It would have been hard,<br> but I would have buried you.<br> And I would have wept.<br> Take these.<br> I don't...<br> Come on.<br> ...want pills.<br> I want him back!<br> I want my son back!<br> I want Martyn!<br> Give me my son!<br> Martyn is dead.<br> Your son is dead.<br> Give his death to me.<br> Give it to me.<br> Give me his death.<br> Give it to me.<br> It's true, isn't it?<br> What a pity we ever met.<br> I think for everyone<br> there's just one person.<br> For me...<br> it was Martyn.<br> For you, Anna.<br> Poor Anna.<br> Who?<br> Were you ever in love with me...<br> and this?<br> Not enough?<br> Not enough for you?<br> For a moment there,<br> I thought of making love to you.<br> Time. Grand healer, time.<br> Time, not a day and a night.<br> Come through, gentlemen.<br> Gentlemen, in order to protect<br> my family and my colleagues...<br> I am this morning<br> tendering my resignation.<br> Come in.<br> I tried to warn you.<br> I did try to warn you.<br> I know.<br> Do you know where she's gone?<br> Where?<br> She came here last night.<br> She wanted to stay with me.<br> Did she...<br> I wonder,<br> did she leave a message?<br> I do need to know<br> where she's gone.<br> I think you know.<br> You must remember.<br> She told you the story<br> of what happened last time.<br> She'll go back to Peter.<br> You must know that.<br> I must go.<br> I am sorry.<br> Good-bye.<br> We shan't meet again.<br> Thank you.<br> She's here, isn't she?<br> She's here.<br> It takes a remarkably short time<br> to withdraw from the world.<br> I traveled...<br> until I arrived<br> at a life of my own.<br> What really makes us<br> is beyond grasping.<br> It's way beyond knowing.<br> We give in to love...<br> because it gives us some sense<br> of what is unknowable.<br> Nothing else matters,<br> not at the end.<br> I saw her once more only.<br> I saw her by accident<br> at an airport, changing planes.<br> She didn't see me.<br> She was with Peter.<br> She was holding a child.<br> She was no different<br> from anyone else.<br>
