                        Sequence.<br> Well, my dear...<br> So how are you adapting<br> to the world outside?<br> Very well, I think.<br> I've advised her to watch and learn<br> and be quiet except when spoken to.<br> So we must see what we can devise<br> for your amusement.<br> Valmont is here.<br> You receive him, do you?<br> Yes.<br> So do you.<br> Monsieur le Vicomte de Valmont,<br> my child...<br> ...whom you very probably<br> don't remember...<br> ...except that he is<br> conspicuously charming...<br> ...never opens his mouth without first<br> calculating what damage he can do.<br> Then why do you receive him,<br> maman?<br> Everyone receives him.<br> Madame.<br> What a pleasant surprise.<br> Madame de Volanges.<br> How delightful to see you.<br> You remember my daughter, Ccile?<br> Well, indeed, but who could have<br> foretold she would flower so gracefully?<br> I wanted to call on you<br> before leaving the city.<br> Oh...<br> I'm not sure we can allow that.<br> Why should you want to leave?<br> Paris in August, you know...<br> ...and it's time I paid a visit on my aunt.<br> I've neglected her disgracefully.<br> Madame de Rosemonde<br> has been good enough...<br> ...to invite us to stay at the chteau.<br> Won't you please give her<br> our warmest regards?<br> I shall make a point of it, Madame.<br> I think it's time we took you home.<br> I'm used to being in bed<br> by nine at the convent.<br> So I should hope.<br> Your aunt?<br> That's correct.<br> I thought she'd already made<br> arrangements to leave you all her money.<br> Do you know why I summoned you<br> here this evening?<br> I'd hoped it might be for<br> the pleasure of my company.<br> I need you...<br> ...to carry out an heroic enterprise.<br> You remember when Bastide left me?<br> Yes.<br> And went off with that fat mistress<br> of yours whose name escapes me.<br> Yes, yes.<br> No one has ever done that to me before.<br> Or to you, I suspect.<br> I was quite relieved to be rid of her,<br> frankly.<br> No, you weren't.<br> For some years now,<br> Bastide has been searching for a wife.<br> He was always unshakably prejudiced<br> in favour of convent education.<br> And now he's found the ideal candidate.<br> Ccile Volanges.<br> Very good.<br> And her 60,000 a year.<br> That must have played some small part<br> in Bastide's calculations.<br> None whatsoever.<br> Bastide's priority, you see...<br> ... is a guaranteed virtue.<br> I wonder if I'm beginning to guess<br> what it is you're intending to propose.<br> Bastide is with his regiment in Corsica<br> for the rest of the year.<br> That should give you plenty of time.<br> You mean to...?<br> - She's a rosebud.<br> - You think so?<br> And he'd get back from his honeymoon...<br> ...to find himself the laughing stock<br> of Paris.<br> - Well...<br> - Yes.<br> Love and revenge. Two of your favourites.<br> No, I can't.<br> What?<br> Oh really, I can't.<br> - Why not?<br> - Oh, it's too easy.<br> It is.<br> She's seen nothing.<br> She knows nothing.<br> She's bound to be curious.<br> She'd be on her back...<br> ...before you'd unwrapped<br> the first bunch of flowers.<br> Any one of a dozen men could manage it.<br> I have my reputation to think of.<br> I can see I'm going to have<br> to tell you everything.<br> - Of course you are.<br> - Yes.<br> My aunt is not on her own<br> just at the moment.<br> She has a young friend staying with her.<br> Madame de Tourvel.<br> You can't mean it.<br> To seduce a woman famous<br> for strict morals...<br> ...religious fervour and the happiness<br> of her marriage...<br> What could possibly be more prestigious?<br> I think there's something degrading<br> about having a husband for a rival.<br> It's humiliating if you fail,<br> and commonplace if you succeed.<br> Where is Monsieur de Tourvel anyway?<br> Presiding over some<br> endless case in Burgundy.<br> I don't think you can hope<br> for any actual pleasure.<br> Oh, yes.<br> You see, I have no intention<br> of breaking down her prejudices.<br> I want her to believe in God and virtue<br> and the sanctity of marriage...<br> ...and still not be able to stop herself.<br> I want the excitement of watching her...<br> ...betray everything that's<br> most important to her.<br> Surely you understand that.<br> I thought "betrayal"<br> was your favourite word.<br> No, no...<br> ..."cruelty. "<br> I always think that has a nobler ring to it.<br> - How is Belleroche?<br> - I'm very pleased with him.<br> And is he your only lover?<br> Yes.<br> I think you should take another.<br> I think it most unhealthy, this exclusivity.<br> You're not jealous, are you?<br> Of course I am.<br> Belleroche is completely undeserving.<br> I thought he was one<br> of your closest friends.<br> Exactly, so I know what I'm talking about.<br> No,<br> I think you should organise an infidelity.<br> With me, for example.<br> You refuse me a simple favour...<br> ...then you expect to be indulged?<br> It's only because it is so simple.<br> It wouldn't feel like a conquest.<br> I have to follow my destiny.<br> I have to be true...<br> ...to my profession.<br> All right then.<br> Come back when you've succeeded<br> with Madame de Tourvel.<br> Yes.<br> And I will offer you...<br> ...a reward.<br> My love.<br> But I shall require proof.<br> Certainly.<br> Written proof.<br> Not negotiable.<br> I don't suppose there's<br> any possibility of an advance?<br> Goodnight, Vicomte.<br> Where have you been?<br> Time has no logic when I'm not with you.<br> An hour is like a century.<br> I've told you before,<br> we shall get on a great deal better...<br> ...if you make a concerted effort<br> not to sound like the latest novel.<br> It's such a beautiful day,<br> I believe we'll walk.<br> You didn't take the sacrament today.<br> No.<br> May I ask why?<br> I have this appalling reputation,<br> as you may know.<br> Yes, I have been warned about you.<br> You have? By whom?<br> A friend.<br> The fact is I've spent my life<br> surrounded by immoral people.<br> I've allowed myself<br> to be influenced by them...<br> ...and sometimes even taken pride<br> in outshining them.<br> - And now?<br> - Now...<br> ...what I most often feel is unworthiness.<br> But it is precisely at such moments<br> that you start to become worthy.<br> I certainly believe one should<br> constantly strive to improve oneself.<br> Chevalier...<br> ...I don't believe you know my cousin,<br> Madame de Volanges.<br> This is Chevalier Danceny.<br> And Madame's daughter, Ccile.<br> Tell us what we should think of the opera.<br> It's sublime, don't you find?<br> Monsieur Danceny is one<br> of those rare eccentrics...<br> ...who come here to listen to the music.<br> I do look forward to our next meeting.<br> Charming young man...<br> ...penniless, regrettably.<br> He's one of the finest<br> music teachers in the city.<br> Perhaps you should employ him.<br> How are you getting on<br> with Madame de Tourvel's maid?<br> Julie, to tell you the truth, sir,<br> it's been a bit boring.<br> If I wasn't so anxious to keep<br> Your Lordship abreast...<br> ...I think I'd have only bothered the once.<br> Still, what else is there to do<br> in the country?<br> It wasn't so much the details<br> of your intimacy I was after...<br> ...it's whether or not she's agreed<br> to bring me Madame de Tourvel's letters.<br> - She won't steal the letters, sir.<br> - She won't?<br> You know better than me, sir.<br> It's easy enough making them do<br> what they want to do.<br> It's trying to get them to do<br> what you want them to do...<br> ...that gives you a headache.<br> And them, as often as not.<br> I need to know who's<br> writing to her about me.<br> I shouldn't worry if I was you, sir.<br> She told Julie she didn't believe<br> you went hunting in the mornings.<br> She said she was going<br> to have you followed.<br> So I'd say it was only a matter of time.<br> That is a terrible noise he's making.<br> He should get the news back<br> to her twice as quickly.<br> I don't think we should make it<br> too easy for him.<br> What exactly do you think you're doing?<br> I am impounding these effects, sir.<br> Has it not been explained to you?<br> Monsieur Armand is not well.<br> I don't make the laws, sir.<br> I just do what I'm told.<br> Everybody has to pay his taxes.<br> How much does he owe?<br> How much?<br> Fifty-six<br> livres.<br> - Pay him.<br> - Yes, my lord.<br> Monsieur Armand...<br> Excuse me, you don't know me.<br> Of course I do, Monsieur le Vicomte.<br> Please, don't get up.<br> - I have to. They're taking the bed.<br> - No, not at all.<br> No one's taking anything.<br> Just to tide you over. I insist.<br> Me, sir...<br> Fifty-six livres to save<br> an entire family from ruin.<br> That seems a genuine bargain.<br> These days, my lord,<br> you can find half a dozen like that...<br> ...in any village in the country.<br> Really?<br> I must say the family was<br> very well chosen.<br> Solidly respectable...<br> ...gratifyingly tearful,<br> no suspiciously pretty girls. Well done.<br> I do my best for you, sir.<br> And all that humble gratitude.<br> It was most affecting.<br> Certainly brought a tear to my eye.<br> That's from her husband.<br> This must be from<br> that officious friend of hers.<br> Tell me, where do you and Julie meet?<br> In my room, sir.<br> - And is she coming tonight?<br> - Afraid so.<br> I think I may be forced to burst in on you.<br> See if blackmail will succeed<br> any better than bribery.<br> About two o'clock suit you?<br> I don't want to embarrass you.<br> Will that give you enough time?<br> Ample, sir.<br> Is this true about Monsieur Armand?<br> I don't believe I know anyone<br> of that name.<br> You may as well own up, Monsieur.<br> My footman happened to be passing...<br> ...when you were in the village<br> this morning.<br> I don't think you should pay too much<br> attention to servants' gossip.<br> It is true, isn't it?<br> Well...<br> ...yes.<br> It is.<br> You dear boy,<br> come and let me give you a hug.<br> I can't understand how someone<br> whose instincts are so generous...<br> ...could lead such a dissolute life.<br> I'm afraid you have an exaggerated idea...<br> ...both of my generosity<br> and of my depravity.<br> If I knew who'd given you<br> such a dire account of me...<br> Since I don't...<br> ...let me make a confession.<br> I'm afraid the key to the paradox lies<br> in a certain weakness of character.<br> I can't see how so thoughtful an act<br> of charity could be described as weak.<br> Because it was simply a response...<br> ...to a strong new influence in my life.<br> Yours.<br> You see how weak I am?<br> I promised myself<br> I was never going to tell you.<br> It's just that looking at you...<br> You needn't worry...<br> ...I have no illicit intentions.<br> I would not dream of insulting you.<br> But I do love you.<br> I adore you.<br> Please, help me.<br> - I rang a number of times.<br> - Didn't hear, sir.<br> - I require some hot water.<br> - Right away, sir.<br> Don't move.<br> - Azolan...<br> - Sir?<br> Wait for me in my room.<br> You know I can't condone<br> this sort of behaviour, Julie.<br> I know, sir.<br> - But, you may rely on my discretion.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Providing, of course,<br> that you agree to my price.<br> No. Nothing like that.<br> No, all I want is to get<br> to see every letter...<br> ...that Madame de Tourvel<br> has received since her arrival here...<br> ...and every letter that she writes<br> from now on.<br> But sir, I can't-<br> Deliver them to Azolan<br> by midnight tomorrow.<br> For your trouble.<br> Would it be very wrong of me<br> to answer Monsieur Danceny's letters?<br> - In the circumstances, yes.<br> - In what circumstances?<br> It's not my place to<br> tell you this, my dear...<br> ...if I hadn't become so fond of you...<br> Go on, please.<br> Your marriage has been arranged.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Oh, someone I know slightly.<br> Monsieur le Comte de Bastide.<br> - What's he like?<br> - Well...<br> You don't like him?<br> Oh, it's not that. He's a man<br> of somewhat erratic judgement.<br> - And rather serious.<br> - How old is he?<br> - Thirty-six.<br> - Thirty-six! He's an old man.<br> Do you know when?<br> In the new year, I believe.<br> Maybe there's a way to let you<br> write to Monsieur Danceny.<br> Oh, Madame.<br> If you were to let me see both sides<br> of the correspondence...<br> ...I could reassure myself.<br> But I can't show the letters<br> I've already sent him.<br> I trust you slept well, Madame.<br> I wish I could say that I had.<br> I thought the least I could hope for<br> was that you would respect me.<br> But I do, of course I do!<br> You've offended me deeply.<br> It's unforgivable.<br> This confirms everything<br> I've been told about you.<br> I'm beginning to think you may<br> have planned the whole exercise.<br> I had no idea you were staying here.<br> Not that it would have disturbed me<br> in the slightest if I had known.<br> You see, until I met you,<br> I had only ever experienced desire.<br> Love, never.<br> - That's enough.<br> - No, no...<br> ...you've made an accusation.<br> You must allow me the opportunity<br> to defend myself.<br> I'm not going to deny<br> that I was aware of your beauty...<br> ...but the point is,<br> this has nothing to do with your beauty.<br> As I got to know you, I began to realise...<br> ...that beauty was the least<br> of your qualities.<br> I became fascinated by your goodness.<br> I was drawn in by it.<br> I didn't understand<br> what was happening to me.<br> It was only when I began to feel<br> actual physical pain...<br> ...every time you left the room...<br> ...that it finally dawned on me.<br> I was in love.<br> ...but that didn't matter to me.<br> It's not that I want to have you,<br> all I want is to deserve you.<br> Tell me what to do.<br> Show me how to behave.<br> I'll do anything you say.<br> Very well, then.<br> I would like you to leave this house.<br> I don't see why that should be necessary.<br> Let's just say you've spent<br> your whole life making it necessary.<br> And if you refuse,<br> I shall be forced to leave myself.<br> Well then, of course, whatever you say.<br> Thank you.<br> Perhaps I might be so bold<br> as to ask a favour in return?<br> I think it would only be<br> just to let me know...<br> ...which of your friends<br> has blackened my name.<br> If friends of mine have warned me<br> against you...<br> ...I could hardly reward them<br> with betrayal.<br> I must say,<br> you devalue your generous offer...<br> ...if you want to use it<br> as a bargaining point.<br> Very well, I withdraw the request.<br> I hope you won't think I'm bargaining<br> if I ask you to let me write to you.<br> - Well-<br> - And pray that you will do me...<br> ...the kindness of answering my letters.<br> I'm not sure a correspondence with you...<br> ...is something a woman of honour<br> could permit herself.<br> You're determined to refuse<br> my suggestions, however respectable.<br> - I didn't say that.<br> - And you'd rather be unjust...<br> ...than risk showing me<br> a touch of kindness?<br> I would welcome the chance<br> to prove to you...<br> ...that what lies behind this<br> is not hatred or resentment but-<br> But what?<br> Listen to this:<br> "He knows exactly how far<br> he may venture without risk...<br> "... and guarantees his own security...<br> "... by tormenting only the safest kind<br> of victim: women. "<br> Madame de Volanges...<br> - Goodbye, Aunt.<br> - Goodbye, dear boy.<br> - Monsieur, please...<br> - I'll write soon.<br> My dear Madame de Tourvel...<br> ...I have just come...<br> - Don't move, I said. -<br> ...to my desk...<br> ...in the middle of a stormy night...<br> ...during which...<br> ...I have been...<br> ...tossed...<br> ... from exultation...<br> ... to exhaustion...<br> ... and back again.<br> Y et, despite these torments...<br> ... I guarantee that at this moment...<br> ... I am far happier than you.<br> We'll finish it later, shall we?<br> Your damned cousin, the Volanges bitch...<br> ...wanted me away<br> from Madame de Tourvel.<br> Well, now I am and I intend<br> to make her suffer for it.<br> Your plan, to ruin her daughter,<br> are you making any progress?<br> Is there anything I can do to help?<br> I'm entirely at your disposal.<br> Well...<br> ...yes.<br> I told Danceny you would act<br> as his confidant and advisor.<br> I need you to stiffen his resolve,<br> if that's the phrase.<br> I thought if anyone could help him-<br> Help? He doesn't need help,<br> he needs hindrances.<br> If he has to climb over enough of them...<br> ...he might inadvertently<br> fall on top of her.<br> I take it he hasn't been a great success.<br> He's been disastrous.<br> Like most intellectuals,<br> he's intensely stupid.<br> I often wonder how you managed<br> to invent yourself.<br> I had no choice, did I? I'm a woman.<br> Women are obliged to be<br> far more skillful than men.<br> You can ruin our reputation and our life<br> with a few well-chosen words.<br> So, of course,<br> I had to invent not only myself...<br> ...but ways of escape<br> no one has ever thought of before.<br> And I've succeeded because...<br> ...I've always known I was born<br> to dominate your sex and avenge my own.<br> Yes, but what I ask was, how?<br> When I came out into society I was 15.<br> I already knew that the role<br> I was condemned to...<br> ...namely, to keep quiet<br> and do what I was told...<br> ...gave me the perfect<br> opportunity to listen and observe.<br> Not to what people told me,<br> which naturally was of no interest...<br> ...but to whatever it was<br> they were trying to hide.<br> I practised detachment.<br> I learnt how to look cheerful<br> while under the table...<br> ...I stuck a fork into the back of my hand.<br> I became...<br> ...a virtuoso of deceit.<br> It wasn't pleasure I was after,<br> it was knowledge.<br> I consulted the strictest moralist<br> to learn how to appear.<br> Philosophers, to find out what to think.<br> And novelists,<br> to see what I could get away with.<br> And in the end I distilled everything<br> to one wonderfully simple principle...<br> ...win or die.<br> So, you're infallible, are you?<br> If I want a man, I have him.<br> If he wants to tell, he finds that he can't.<br> That's the whole story.<br> And was that our story?<br> I wanted you before we'd ever met.<br> My self-esteem demanded it.<br> Then when you began to pursue me...<br> ...I wanted you so badly.<br> It's the only time I have ever been<br> controlled by my desire.<br> Single combat.<br> Madame de Volanges...<br> Your note said it was urgent.<br> It's days now. I haven't been able<br> to think of anything else.<br> Please, sit down.<br> I have reason to believe...<br> ...that a... how should I describe it...<br> ...that a dangerous liaison<br> has sprung up between your daughter...<br> ...and the Chevalier Danceny.<br> Oh, no, that's completely absurd.<br> Ccile is still a child.<br> She understands nothing of these things.<br> And Danceny is an entirely<br> respectable young man.<br> Tell me...<br> ...does Ccile have a great<br> many correspondents?<br> Why do you ask?<br> I went to her room<br> at the beginning of this week.<br> I simply knocked on the door and entered.<br> She was stuffing an envelope...<br> ...into the top right-hand drawer<br> of her bureau...<br> ...in which I couldn't help noticing...<br> ...there seemed to be a large number<br> of similar letters.<br> I am most grateful to you.<br> Would you think it impertinent<br> if I were to make another suggestion?<br> No, no.<br> If my recollection is correct...<br> ...I overheard you saying<br> to the Vicomte de Valmont...<br> ...that his aunt invited you and Ccile<br> to stay at her chteau.<br> She has, yes, repeatedly.<br> A spell in the country<br> might be the very thing.<br> Thank you.<br> You asked for hindrances.<br> You are a genuinely wicked woman.<br> And you wanted a chance<br> to make my cousin suffer.<br> I can't resist you.<br> I made it easy for you.<br> But, all this is most inconvenient.<br> The Comtesse de Beaulieu<br> has invited me to stay.<br> Well, you will just have to put her off.<br> Well, the Comtesse has promised me<br> extensive use of her gardens.<br> It seems her husband's fingers are<br> not as green as they once were.<br> Maybe not.<br> But from what I hear,<br> all his friends are gardeners.<br> Is that so?<br> You want your revenge, I want my revenge.<br> I'm afraid there's only<br> one place you can go.<br> Back to Auntie?<br> Back to Auntie.<br> Where you can also pursue<br> that other matter.<br> You have some evidence to procure,<br> have you not?<br> Don't you think it would<br> be a generous gesture...<br> ...to show the proper confidence<br> in my abilities...<br> ...if we were to take<br> that evidence for granted?<br> I need it in writing, Vicomte.<br> - Now you must leave me.<br> - Must I? Why?<br> - Because I'm hungry.<br> - Yes?<br> I have quite an appetite myself.<br> Then go home and eat.<br> In writing.<br> You'll be pleased to hear,<br> my dear that Armand is on his feet again...<br> ...and back at work.<br> Who?<br> Monsieur Armand!<br> Whose family you helped so generously.<br> Oh, yes!<br> When my nephew was last here<br> we discovered, quite by chance...<br> ...that he had gone into the village-<br> Are you feeling all right, Madame?<br> I'm sorry to interrupt, Aunt.<br> It seemed to me, all of a sudden...<br> ...that Madame de Tourvel<br> didn't look at all well.<br> - No, I'm quite all right.<br> - Perhaps you need some fresh air.<br> Do you feel constricted in any way?<br> I feel sure Madame de Volanges is right,<br> as usual.<br> A turn around the grounds, perhaps.<br> Yes, a little walk in the garden.<br> It's not too cool, I think.<br> Fresh air will do you the world of good.<br> That meal was somewhat heavy, perhaps.<br> I can't believe that was the cause.<br> Come back for it.<br> Mademoiselle!<br> I've no wish to arouse suspicion,<br> so I'll be brief.<br> The letter is from the Chevalier Danceny.<br> - Yes, I thought-<br> - Now, the handing over of such letters...<br> ...is a far from easy matter to accomplish.<br> I cannot be expected to create<br> a diversion every day.<br> So...<br> This key resembles your bedroom key.<br> I happen to know it is kept<br> in your mother's room...<br> ...on the mantelpiece,<br> tied with a blue ribbon.<br> Take it,<br> go up and attach the blue ribbon to it...<br> ...and put it in the place<br> of your bedroom key.<br> Bring it to me and I will get<br> a copy cut within two hours.<br> Then I can collect your letters<br> and deliver Danceny's...<br> ...without any complications.<br> Now, in the cupboard by your bed...<br> ...you'll find a feather<br> and a small bottle of oil...<br> ...so that you may oil the lock<br> and hinges on the ante-room door.<br> Are you sure, Monsieur?<br> Trust me.<br> Believe me, Mademoiselle...<br> ...if there's one thing I can't abide,<br> it's deceitfulness.<br> I trust you are feeling a little better,<br> Madame.<br> If I were ill, Monsieur, it would not be<br> difficult to guess who was responsible.<br> You can't mean me, do you?<br> - You promised to leave here.<br> - And I did.<br> Would you excuse me, Madame?<br> Quick, your mother.<br> What are you doing?<br> I just came in to fetch your shawl.<br> Why are you so angry with me?<br> All I can offer you is my friendship.<br> Can't you accept it?<br> I could pretend to,<br> but that would be dishonest.<br> The man I used to be would have been<br> content with friendship...<br> ...and then set about trying<br> to turn it to his advantage.<br> But I have changed now.<br> I can't conceal from you that<br> I love you tenderly, passionately...<br> ...and above all, respectfully.<br> So how am I to demote myself<br> to the tepid position of friend?<br> Not that you are even<br> pretending to show friendship.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Well, is this friendly?<br> Why must you deliberately<br> destroy my peace of mind?<br> You were wrong to feel threatened by me,<br> Madame.<br> Your happiness is far more<br> important to me than my own.<br> That is what I mean<br> when I say that I love you.<br> I think we should end this conversation.<br> I shall leave you in<br> possession of the field.<br> But look...<br> We are to be living under the same roof,<br> at least for a few days.<br> Surely we don't have to try<br> to avoid each other?<br> Of course not.<br> Provided you adhere<br> to my few simple rules.<br> I shall obey you in this as in everything.<br> Monsieur...<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing to worry about.<br> Have you brought a letter?<br> No.<br> Then what...?<br> What are you going to tell your mother?<br> How will you explain the fact<br> that I have your key?<br> If I tell her I'm here at your invitation...<br> ...I have a feeling she will believe me.<br> What do you want?<br> Well, I don't know...<br> What do you think?<br> No!<br> All right.<br> I just want you to give me a kiss.<br> - A kiss?<br> - That's all.<br> - Then will you go?<br> - Then I'll go.<br> - Promise?<br> - Whatever you say.<br> All right?<br> Very nice.<br> No, I mean, will you go now?<br> Oh, I don't think so.<br> But you promised.<br> I promised to go when you gave me a kiss.<br> You didn't give me a kiss.<br> I gave you a kiss.<br> Not the same thing at all.<br> And if I give you a kiss...?<br> Let's just get ourselves more comfortable,<br> shall we?<br> I had better go and see what's wrong,<br> if you will excuse me.<br> Of course, my dear.<br> I shouldn't worry, Madame.<br> The young have such miraculous<br> powers of recuperation.<br> I'm sure she will soon<br> be back in the saddle.<br> Who else can I turn to in<br> my desperation, Madame?<br> And how can I write<br> the necessary words?<br> There's something going on,<br> and Ccile will not tell me.<br> You must speak to her at once.<br> Tell me...<br> ...you resisted him, did you?<br> Of course I did...<br> ...as much as I could.<br> - But he forced you?<br> - No...<br> ...not exactly.<br> But I found it almost<br> impossible to defend myself.<br> Why was that? Did he tie you up?<br> No, he just has a way of putting things.<br> You can't think of an answer.<br> Not even "no"?<br> I kept on saying no all the time.<br> But somehow,<br> that was not what I was doing.<br> I am so ashamed.<br> You'll find the shame is like the pain.<br> You only feel it once.<br> You really want my advice?<br> Please.<br> Allow Monsieur de Valmont...<br> ...to continue your instruction.<br> Convince your mother<br> you've forgotten Danceny.<br> And raise no objection to the marriage.<br> With Monsieur de Bastide?<br> When it comes to marriage,<br> one man is as good as the next.<br> And even the least accommodating<br> is less trouble than a mother.<br> Are you saying, I'm going to have to do...<br> ...that, with three different men?<br> I am saying, you stupid little girl...<br> ...that provided you take<br> a few elementary precautions...<br> ...you can do it, or not...<br> ...with as many men as you like...<br> ...as often as you like...<br> ...in as many different ways as you like.<br> Our sex has few enough advantages,<br> so make the best of those you have.<br> Now, here comes your<br> maman...<br> ...so remember what I've said,<br> and above all, no snivelling.<br> How are you feeling now, my dear?<br> Much better, thank you,<br> maman.<br> I think you look tired.<br> I think you should go to bed.<br> No, I-<br> I think you should do<br> as your mother suggests.<br> We can arrange to have<br> something brought to your room.<br> I'm sure it will do you good.<br> Well, perhaps you are right, Madame.<br> You have such a very good<br> influence on her.<br> I don't think I have congratulated you<br> on your revenge.<br> - So, you know.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> And I believe from now<br> you will find her door unbolted.<br> Where is she?<br> I can't see her at the moment.<br> Surely I have explained to you before<br> how much I enjoy watching the battle...<br> ...between love and virtue.<br> What concerns me is that<br> you seem to enjoy watching it...<br> ...much more than you used<br> to enjoy winning it.<br> All in good time.<br> The century is drawing to its close.<br> Isn't it a pity that our agreement...<br> ...does not relate to the task you set me...<br> ...rather than the task I set myself?<br> I am grateful, of course.<br> But that would have been<br> almost insultingly simple.<br> One does not applaud the tenor<br> for clearing his throat.<br> As with every other science,<br> the first thing you must learn...<br> ...is to call everything by its proper name.<br> I don't see why we have to talk at all.<br> Without the correct polite vocabulary...<br> ...how would you indicate<br> what you would like me to do...<br> ...or make an offer of something<br> I might find agreeable.<br> Surely you just-<br> You see, if I do my work adequately...<br> ...I would like to think that<br> you will be able to...<br> ...surprise Monsieur de Bastide<br> on his wedding night.<br> - Would he be pleased?<br> - Of course.<br> He'll merely assume your maman<br> has done her duty and fully briefed you.<br> Maman couldn't possibly<br> talk of anything of that sort.<br> I can't think why.<br> She was, after all, one of the most<br> notorious young women in Paris.<br> - Maman?<br> - Certainly.<br> More noted for her enthusiasm<br> than her ability...<br> ...if I remember rightly.<br> There was a famous occasion<br> before you were born...<br> This would have been...<br> ...when your mother went to stay<br> with the Comtesse de Beaulieu...<br> ...who tactfully gave her a room<br> between your father's...<br> ...and that of a Monsieur de Vressac...<br> ...who was her acknowledged<br> lover at the time.<br> Yet,<br> in spite of these careful arrangements...<br> ...she contrived to spend<br> the night with a third party.<br> I can't believe that.<br> No, no, I assure you, it's true.<br> How do you know?<br> The third party was myself.<br> You asked me if Monsieur de Bastide<br> would be pleased with your abilities.<br> And the answer is...<br> ...education is never a waste.<br> Now...<br> ...I think we might begin...<br> ...with one or two Latin terms.<br> We go for a walk together<br> almost every day.<br> A little further every<br> time down the path...<br> ... that has no turning.<br> She has accepted my love...<br> ... I have accepted her friendship.<br> We are both aware of how little<br> there is to choose between them.<br> I wish you knew me well enough<br> to recognize...<br> ...how much you have changed me.<br> My friends in Paris remarked on it at once.<br> I have become the soul of consideration...<br> ...conscientious, charitable...<br> ...more celibate than a monk.<br> More celibate?<br> Well,<br> you know the stories one hears in Paris.<br> I feel she is inches from surrender.<br> Her eyes are closing.<br> Madame.<br> Where are you going, Monsieur?<br> - To the salon.<br> - There is no one there.<br> The others have all decided<br> on an early night.<br> - I very much missed our walk today.<br> - Yes.<br> I fear with the weather as it is, we can<br> look forward to very few more of them.<br> - This heavy rain is surely exceptional.<br> - Yes. May I?<br> Of course.<br> But, you see, within a week<br> I shall have concluded my business.<br> - I see.<br> - Even so, I am not sure...<br> ...I will be able to bring myself to leave.<br> Oh, please. You must.<br> Are you still so anxious to be rid of me?<br> You know the answer to that.<br> I rely on your integrity and generosity.<br> I want to able to be grateful to you.<br> Forgive me if I say<br> I do not want your gratitude.<br> What I want from you<br> is something altogether deeper.<br> I know God is punishing me for my pride.<br> I was so certain this could never happen.<br> Nothing like what? Do you mean love?<br> - Is love what you mean?<br> - You promised not to speak of it.<br> Yes, of course, I understand,<br> but I must know.<br> I can't, don't you understand?<br> It's impossible.<br> You don't have to speak. Just look at me.<br> Yes...<br> For God's sake, you must leave<br> me if you don't want to kill me.<br> You must help...<br> Fetch Madame,<br> Madame de Tourvel has been taken ill.<br> I heard something as I was passing.<br> She seemed to be having<br> difficulty breathing.<br> - Oh, my dear, whatever is it?<br> - I am all right now.<br> I shall leave her<br> in your capable hands, Aunt.<br> We must send for a doctor, my dear.<br> No, no, please.<br> I don't need a doctor. I just...<br> Sit with me for a moment.<br> I must leave this house.<br> I am most desperately in love.<br> To leave is the last thing in the world<br> I want to do, but...<br> ...I'd rather die than<br> to live with the guilt.<br> My dear girl,<br> none of this is any surprise to me.<br> The only thing that might surprise<br> one is how little the world changes.<br> What should I do? What is your advice?<br> If I remember rightly in such matters...<br> ...all advice is useless.<br> I have never been so unhappy.<br> I'm sorry to say this but...<br> ...those who are most worthy of love<br> are never made happy by it.<br> But why? Why should that be?<br> Do you still think men<br> love the way we do?<br> No...<br> ...men enjoy the happiness they feel.<br> We can only enjoy the happiness we give.<br> They are not capable...<br> ...of devoting themselves<br> exclusively to one person.<br> So to hope to be made happy by love...<br> ...is a certain cause of grief.<br> I am devoted to my nephew.<br> But what is true of most men...<br> ...is doubly so of him.<br> And yet...<br> ...he could have, just now...<br> ...he took pity on me.<br> If he has released you...<br> ...my dear child, you must go.<br> Get up, sir, quick.<br> Sir!<br> Over here.<br> What is it?<br> - Madame de Tourvel.<br> - What?<br> I want you to follow her, right now.<br> Stay close to her.<br> I want to know everything.<br> Where she goes. Who she sees.<br> What she eats. If she sleeps.<br> Everything.<br> That's for bribes. Yours will come later.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Now, go.<br> Go!<br> Dear Father Anselme...<br> ... try as I may, I cannot see...<br> ... the necessity for the interview<br> you suggest.<br> However, since you insist...<br> ... I propose you bring him to see me...<br> ... on Thursday, the<br> This is excellent.<br> Make sure Father Anselme receives it.<br> What news?<br> No visitors.<br> There still has not been<br> a single visitor since she got back.<br> A bite of soup last night,<br> didn't touch the pheasant.<br> Afterwards, a cup of tea.<br> Nothing else to report.<br> Oh yes, sir, there is.<br> You wanted to know<br> what she was reading.<br> The book by her bed is<br> "Christian Thoughts...<br> "... Volume Two. "<br> How is Julie?<br> She seems a bit keener than<br> she was in the country.<br> And yourself?<br> Talk about devotion to duty.<br> Off you go.<br> Keep it up.<br> - Madame...<br> - Vicomte...<br> Well...<br> ...what a pleasant surprise.<br> Danceny...<br> Thank you, Monsieur, for everything.<br> Well, I was afraid I had been<br> a sad disappointment to you.<br> On the contrary.<br> It is you I have to thank<br> for keeping our love alive.<br> Well, as to love, Ccile<br> thinks of little else.<br> She and her mother are coming<br> back to Paris in two weeks...<br> ...and she is longing to see you.<br> I have had the most<br> wonderful letter from her.<br> Really?<br> Not like any of her other letters,<br> somehow...<br> ...quite a different tone of voice.<br> My dearest...<br> ...Danceny...<br> ...I swear to you...<br> ...on my chastity...<br> ...that even if my mother forces me<br> to go through with this marriage...<br> ...I shall be yours completely.<br> Your friend, the Vicomte de Valmont...<br> ... has been very active on your behalf.<br> I doubt if you could do more yourself.<br> I don't know how I could bear to go<br> another two weeks without seeing her.<br> We shall have to do our very best<br> to provide some distraction for you.<br> If you would be so kind<br> as to wait in the carriage.<br> There's a matter I must discuss<br> with the Vicomte in private.<br> Of course.<br> I don't know how I can ever repay you.<br> Don't give it another thought.<br> It's been delightful.<br> Poor boy, he's quite harmless.<br> Sometimes, Vicomte,<br> I can't help, but adore you.<br> I have a piece of news I hope<br> you might find entertaining.<br> I have reason to believe<br> the next head of the house of Bastide...<br> ...may be a Valmont.<br> What can you mean?<br> Ccile is two weeks late.<br> Aren't you pleased?<br> I'm not sure.<br> Your aim was to revenge yourself<br> on Bastide.<br> I have provided him with a wife trained<br> by me to perform, quite naturally...<br> ...services one would hesitate<br> to request from a professional...<br> ...and very likely pregnant as well.<br> What more do you want?<br> All right, Vicomte, I agree.<br> You have more than done your duty.<br> Shame you let the other ones<br> slip through your fingers.<br> I let her go.<br> But why?<br> I was moved.<br> Oh, well then, no wonder you bungled it.<br> I have an appointment<br> to visit her on Thursday...<br> ...and this time I shall be merciless.<br> I am pleased to hear it.<br> Why do you suppose we...<br> ...only feel compelled to chase<br> the ones who run away?<br> Immaturity?<br> I shan't have a moment's peace<br> until its over.<br> I love her, I hate her...<br> ...my life is a misery.<br> Well, I think I may have kept<br> our young friend waiting long enough.<br> I shall call on you<br> sometime soon after Thursday.<br> Only if you succeed, Vicomte.<br> I am not sure I can face<br> another catalogue of incompetence.<br> I shall succeed.<br> I hope so.<br> Once upon a time you were<br> a man to be reckoned with.<br> I understand that Father Anselme...<br> ...has explained to you<br> the reason for my visit?<br> Yes, he said you wished<br> to be reconciled with me...<br> ...before beginning instruction with him.<br> That is correct.<br> But I see no need for formal reconciliation,<br> Monsieur.<br> No.<br> When I have, as you said, insulted you...<br> ...and when you have treated me<br> with an unqualified contempt.<br> Contempt?<br> You ran away from my aunt's house<br> in the middle of the night.<br> You refuse to answer<br> or even receive my letters.<br> And all this,<br> after I have shown a restraint...<br> ...of which I think we are both aware.<br> I would call that,<br> at the very least, contempt.<br> I am sure you understand me better<br> than you pretend to, Monsieur.<br> It was me you ran away from, wasn't it?<br> I had to leave.<br> And do you have to keep away from me?<br> I am as unhappy as you could<br> ever have wanted me to be.<br> I have only ever wanted your happiness.<br> How can I be happy without you?<br> I must have you, or die.<br> Death it is.<br> I'm sorry, Madame.<br> All I wanted from this meeting<br> was your forgiveness...<br> ...for the wrongs that you think<br> that I have done you.<br> So that I may end my days<br> in some peace of mind.<br> I understood you approved of the choice<br> my duty has compelled me to make.<br> Yes.<br> And your choice has determined mine.<br> Which is what?<br> The only choice capable of<br> putting an end to my suffering.<br> What do you mean?<br> I love you.<br> You have no idea how much.<br> Just remember I have made<br> far more difficult sacrifices...<br> ...than the one I am about to make. Now...<br> - ... goodbye.<br> - No.<br> You must listen to me!<br> No!<br> Why should you be so upset<br> by the idea of making me happy?<br> You are right. I cannot live<br> either unless I make you happy.<br> So I promise...<br> ...no more refusals...<br> ...and no more regrets.<br> Success!<br> Well...<br> ...I arrived at about six.<br> Yes, I think you may omit<br> the details of the seduction.<br> They are never very enlivening.<br> Just describe the event itself.<br> It was, unprecedented.<br> Really?<br> It had a kind of charm that<br> I don't think I have experienced before.<br> Once she'd surrendered,<br> she behaved with perfect candour.<br> Total mutual delirium.<br> Which, for the first time ever with me,<br> outlasted the pleasure itself.<br> She was astonishing.<br> So much so, that I ended by falling on<br> my knees and pledging her eternal love.<br> And do you know that at that time...<br> ...and for several hours afterwards<br> I actually meant it.<br> I see.<br> It's extraordinary, isn't it?<br> Is it?<br> - It sounds to me perfectly commonplace.<br> - Oh, no...<br> ...I assure you.<br> But of course, the best thing about it is...<br> ...I am now in a position<br> to be able to claim my reward.<br> You mean to say you persuaded her<br> to write a letter as well...<br> ...in the course of<br> this awesome encounter?<br> I didn't necessarily think you were<br> going to be a stickler for formalities.<br> In any case, I may have to declare<br> our arrangement null and void.<br> What do you mean?<br> I am not accustomed<br> to be taken for granted.<br> But there is no question of that.<br> You are misunderstanding me.<br> And I have no wish to tear you away<br> from the arms of someone so astonishing.<br> We have always been<br> frank with one another.<br> And as a matter of fact,<br> I have also taken a new lover...<br> ...who at the moment,<br> is proving more than satisfactory.<br> - Who is that?<br> - I am not in the mood for confidences.<br> Don't let me keep you.<br> You can't seriously imagine<br> I prefer her to you?<br> You may genuinely be unaware of this.<br> But I can see quite plainly<br> that you are in love with this woman.<br> No.<br> Not at all.<br> Have you forgotten what it is like<br> to make a woman happy?<br> And to be made happy yourself?<br> I?<br> Of course not.<br> We loved each other once, didn't we?<br> I think it was love.<br> And you made me very happy.<br> And we could again.<br> We just untied the knot.<br> It was never broken.<br> lllusions of course,<br> are by their nature sweet.<br> I have no illusions.<br> I lost them on my travels.<br> Now...<br> ...I want to come home.<br> As for this present infatuation,<br> it won't last...<br> ...but for the moment,<br> it is beyond my control.<br> My dear Vicomte, I'm obliged<br> to go away for a couple of weeks...<br> ... but I am well aware<br> of our arrangement.<br> On my return you and I will spend<br> a single night together.<br> We shall enjoy it enough<br> to regret it is to be our last.<br> But then we shall remember, that regret<br> is an essential component of happiness.<br> All this, of course...<br> ... providing you are able<br> to procure this famous letter.<br> It shall be done!<br> But, Paris is so tedious without you.<br> And I am living like a medieval hermit.<br> All right, give me a moment.<br> Drink up.<br> What is it?<br> Someone who may well<br> not appreciate your presence.<br> - You mean a woman?<br> - A lady, we might even say.<br> It is not the one we wrote that letter to?<br> - The very one.<br> - I enjoyed that.<br> You proved a most talented desk.<br> I'd like to see what she looks like.<br> - Well, you can't.<br> - Oh...<br> On second thoughts,<br> I don't see why you shouldn't.<br> Tell me,<br> do you have plans for this evening?<br> A few friends round for dinner.<br> - And after dinner?<br> - Nothing firm.<br> Well...<br> I will be there.<br> This is an unexpected pleasure.<br> - I know that woman.<br> - Are you sure? I would be surprised.<br> She has been pointed out<br> to me at the opera.<br> Yes, well, she is striking.<br> She is a courtesan, isn't she?<br> Yes, I suppose, in a manner of speaking.<br> Well I am sorry to have disturbed you.<br> Of course you have not disturbed me.<br> I'm overjoyed to see you.<br> You will never be received<br> at my house again.<br> I don't want your lies and excuses.<br> Sit down. Just hear me out.<br> That is all I ask.<br> Then you can judge.<br> Unfortunately, I cannot unlive<br> the years I lived before I met you...<br> ...and during those years<br> I had a wide acquaintance...<br> ...the majority of whom were no doubt<br> undesirable in one respect or another.<br> Now...<br> ...it may surprise you<br> to know that Emilie...<br> ...in common with many others<br> of her character and profession...<br> ...is kind-hearted enough<br> to take an interest...<br> ...in those less fortunate than herself.<br> In short...<br> ...she has the time and the inclination<br> to do a great deal of charity work.<br> Donations to hospitals, soup for the poor...<br> ...protection for animals...<br> ...anything which touches<br> her sentimental heart.<br> From time to time, I make a small<br> contribution to her purse. That's all.<br> Is that true?<br> My relations with Emilie...<br> ...have been, for some years now,<br> quite blameless.<br> I mean, she has even done a little<br> secretarial work for me on occasion.<br> Why did she laugh?<br> I have no idea.<br> Does she know about me?<br> No doubt she made what,<br> in view of my past...<br> ...must be regarded as a fair assumption.<br> I want to believe you.<br> I knew you were coming up.<br> You were announced.<br> I am sorry.<br> But no...<br> ...no, it's I who must apologize.<br> It was most insensitive of me.<br> I didn't think it was possible<br> for me to love you more.<br> But your jealousy...<br> I love you so much.<br> When will you start writing to me again?<br> My dear Vicomte...<br> ... I don't believe this self-denial<br> can be good for you.<br> I hope it does not mean you are<br> neglecting your little pupil.<br> But where can Danceny be?<br> I told you,<br> I have all my people out looking for him.<br> There is no trace of him.<br> It is only the wind.<br> Where are you?<br> There is nothing to be frightened about.<br> Yes, there is.<br> I am bleeding.<br> Your porter seems to be<br> under the impression...<br> ...that you're still out of town.<br> I have in fact only just returned.<br> Without attracting the attention<br> of your porter?<br> I think it may be time to review<br> your domestic arrangements.<br> I am exhausted.<br> Naturally, I instructed the porter...<br> ...to inform any casual callers<br> that I was out.<br> And you here as well...<br> ...my dear, young friend.<br> The porter appears to be having<br> a somewhat erratic evening.<br> Yes.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> it is you that I am looking for.<br> Is it?<br> Mademoiselle Ccile returns to Paris<br> after an absence of over two months.<br> Now what do you suppose<br> is uppermost in her mind?<br> Answer, of course, the longed-for<br> reunion with her beloved Chevalier.<br> Vicomte, this is no time to make mischief.<br> Nothing could be further<br> from my mind, Madame.<br> Go on.<br> Imagine her distress and alarm when<br> her loved one is nowhere to be found.<br> I have had to do more improvising<br> than an Italian actor.<br> How is she? Is she all right?<br> Oh, yes. Well, no, to be quite frank.<br> I'm sorry to tell you she has been ill.<br> - Ill!<br> - Calm yourself, my friend.<br> The surgeon has declared her<br> well on the road to recovery.<br> But you can well imagine how<br> desperate I have been to find you.<br> Of course, I...<br> My God, how could I have<br> been away at such a time?<br> How can I ever forgive myself?<br> But look, all is well now with Ccile,<br> I assure you.<br> And I shan't disturb you further.<br> It is only that I have a little<br> something to show the Marquise.<br> Wait in my dressing room.<br> - It is through there.<br> - I know where it is.<br> I see she writes as badly as she dresses.<br> Is it really true the little one's been ill?<br> Not so much an illness,<br> more a refurbishment.<br> What do you mean?<br> Miscarriage.<br> Vicomte, I am so sorry.<br> Your son and Bastide's heir.<br> Isn't there something else<br> that we should be discussing?<br> I do hope you are not going<br> to be difficult about Danceny.<br> I know Belleroche was pretty limp...<br> ...but I do think you could have found<br> a livelier replacement...<br> ...than that mawkish schoolboy.<br> Mawkish or not,<br> he's completely devoted to me.<br> And, I suspect,<br> better equipped to provide me with...<br> ...happiness and pleasure than you are...<br> ...in your present mood.<br> I see.<br> If I thought you would be<br> your old charming self...<br> ...I might invite you to visit me<br> one evening next week.<br> Really?<br> I still love you, you see...<br> ...in spite of all your faults<br> and my complaints.<br> Are you sure you are not going<br> to impose some new condition...<br> ...before you agree<br> to honour your obligation?<br> I have a friend who became involved<br> with an entirely unsuitable woman.<br> Whenever any of us<br> pointed this out to him...<br> ...he invariably made the same feeble reply:<br> "It's beyond my control," he would say.<br> He was on the verge of<br> becoming a laughing stock.<br> At which point, another friend of mine,<br> a woman...<br> ...decided to speak to him seriously.<br> She explained to him<br> that his name was in danger...<br> ...of being ludicrously associated<br> with this phrase for the rest of his life.<br> So, do you know what he did?<br> I feel sure you are about to tell me.<br> He went round to see his mistress and<br> bluntly announced he was leaving her.<br> Well, as you can expect,<br> she protested vociferously.<br> But to everything she said...<br> ...to every objection she made...<br> ...he simply replied:<br> "It's beyond my control. "<br> Good night.<br> You're only five minutes late,<br> but I get so frightened.<br> I become convinced I'm never<br> going to see you again.<br> - My angel.<br> - Is it like that for you, too?<br> Yes.<br> At this moment, for example,<br> I'm quite convinced...<br> ...I am never going to see you again.<br> What?<br> I'm so bored, you see.<br> It's beyond my control.<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, after all, it has been four months.<br> So, what I said:<br> It's beyond my control.<br> Do you mean you don't love me anymore?<br> My love had great difficulty<br> outlasting your virtue.<br> It's beyond my control.<br> - It is that woman, isn't it?<br> - You are quite right.<br> I have been deceiving you with Emilie,<br> among others.<br> It's beyond my control.<br> Why are you doing this?<br> There's a woman.<br> Not Emilie, another woman.<br> A woman I adore.<br> And I am afraid she is insisting<br> that I give you up.<br> It's beyond my control.<br> Liar! Liar!<br> You are quite right, I am a liar.<br> And it's like your fidelity, a fact of life.<br> No more nor less irritating.<br> - Certainly beyond my control.<br> - Stop it!<br> Don't keep saying that!<br> Sorry. Beyond my control.<br> Why don't you take another lover?<br> Whatever you would like.<br> It's beyond my control.<br> Do you want to kill me?<br> Listen. Listen to me.<br> You have given me great pleasure.<br> But I simply cannot bring myself<br> to regret leaving you.<br> It is the way of the world.<br> Quite beyond my control.<br> - Tomorrow morning, early.<br> - Yes, my Lord.<br> This is not your appointed night.<br> That story you told me, how did it end?<br> I am not sure I know what you mean.<br> Once this friend of yours had taken<br> the advice of his lady-friend...<br> ...did she take him back?<br> Am I to understand?<br> The day after our last meeting,<br> I broke with Madame de Tourvel...<br> ...on the grounds that it was<br> "beyond my control. "<br> You didn't!<br> I certainly did.<br> But how wonderful of you.<br> You kept telling me<br> my reputation was in danger...<br> ...but I think this may well turn out<br> to be my most famous exploit.<br> I believe that it sets a new standard.<br> Only one thing could possibly<br> bring me greater glory.<br> What is that?<br> To win her back.<br> You think you could?<br> I do not see why not.<br> I'll tell you why not.<br> Because when one woman strikes at<br> the heart of another, she seldom misses...<br> ...and the wound is invariably fatal.<br> - Is that so?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> I am also inclined to see this<br> as one of my greatest triumphs.<br> There is nothing a woman enjoys<br> so much as victory over another woman.<br> Except you see, Vicomte,<br> my victory wasn't over her.<br> Of course it was, what do you mean?<br> It was over you.<br> You loved that woman, Vicomte.<br> What's more, you still do.<br> Quite desperately.<br> If you had not been so ashamed of it...<br> ...how could you have<br> treated her so viciously?<br> You could not bear even the vague<br> possibility of being laughed at.<br> And this has proved something<br> I have always suspected.<br> That vanity and happiness...<br> ...are incompatible.<br> Whatever may or may not be the truth<br> of these philosophical speculations...<br> ...the fact remains,<br> it is now your turn to make a sacrifice.<br> Is that so?<br> - Danceny must go.<br> - Where?<br> I have been more than patient with this<br> little whim of yours. Enough is enough.<br> One of the reasons that I never remarried...<br> ...despite a quite bewildering<br> range of offers...<br> ...was the determination never<br> again to be ordered around.<br> I must therefore ask you to adopt<br> a less "marital" tone of voice.<br> She is ill, you know.<br> I have made her ill for your sake.<br> So the least you can do is<br> get rid of that colourless youth!<br> Haven't you had enough of<br> bullying women for the time being?<br> I see I shall have to<br> make myself very plain.<br> I have come to spend the night.<br> I shall not take at all kindly<br> to being turned away.<br> I am sorry.<br> I have made other arrangements.<br> Yes, I knew there was something.<br> What?<br> Danceny isn't coming. Not tonight.<br> What do you mean. How do you know?<br> I know, because I have arranged<br> for him to spend the night with Ccile.<br> Come to think of it,<br> he mentioned he was expected here.<br> But, when I put it to him that he would<br> really have to make a choice...<br> ...I must say, he did not hesitate.<br> He is coming to see you tomorrow,<br> to explain.<br> And to offer you...<br> - Do I have this right? Yes, I think I do. -<br> ...his eternal friendship.<br> As you said, he is entirely devoted to you.<br> That is enough, Vicomte.<br> You are absolutely right.<br> Shall we go up?<br> Shall we, what?<br> Go up.<br> Unless you prefer this,<br> if memory serves, rather purgatorial sofa.<br> - I think it is time you were leaving.<br> - No, I do not think so.<br> We made an arrangement.<br> I really don't think I can allow myself...<br> ...to be taken advantage of<br> for a moment longer.<br> Remember,<br> I am better at this than you are.<br> Perhaps. But it is always<br> the best swimmers who drown.<br> Now, yes or no?<br> It is up to you, of course.<br> I will merely confine myself to remarking...<br> ...that a "no" will be regarded<br> as a declaration of war.<br> A single word is all that is required.<br> All right.<br> War!<br> My dear Chevalier Danceny...<br> ... I understand you spent<br> last night with Ccile Volanges.<br> I learnt this from her<br> more, regular lover...<br> ... the Vicomte de Valmont.<br> I am dying because<br> I would not believe you.<br> Fetch the surgeon.<br> No, no.<br> Do as I say.<br> A moment of your time.<br> Two things: A word of advice,<br> which of course you may ignore, but...<br> ...it is honestly intended...<br> ...and a request...<br> Go on.<br> The advice is:<br> Be careful of the Marquise de Merteuil.<br> You must permit me to treat<br> with scepticism...<br> ...anything you have to say about her.<br> Nevertheless, I must tell you...<br> ...in this affair, we<br> are both her creatures...<br> ...as I believe her<br> letters to me will prove.<br> When you have read them,<br> you may decide to circulate them.<br> And the request?<br> I want you somehow...<br> ...somehow...<br> ...to get to see Madame de Tourvel.<br> I understand she is very ill.<br> That is why this is most important to me.<br> I want you to tell her<br> that I cannot explain...<br> ...why I broke with her as I did.<br> But that since then,<br> my life has been worth nothing.<br> I pushed the blade in deeper<br> than you just have my boy...<br> ...and now I need you<br> to help me withdraw it.<br> Tell her it is lucky for her<br> that I have gone...<br> ...and I am glad not to have<br> to live without her.<br> Tell her, her love was the only<br> real happiness that I have ever known.<br> Will you do that for me?<br> I will.<br> It is all very well feeling sorry now.<br> Let him be.<br> He had good cause.<br> I don't believe that's something anyone<br> has ever been able to say about me.<br> Enough...<br> Draw the curtains.<br> Get out! Get out of here!<br>
