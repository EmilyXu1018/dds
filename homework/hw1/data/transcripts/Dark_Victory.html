''<br> And the house is always filled<br> with gangs of people and--<br> lf only he knew what happened<br> last week at the Colony.<br> What happened at the Colony?<br> An old lady was coming through.<br> l knocked her umbrella out of her hand.<br> -Why?<br> -Someone said l was drunk.<br> Another time, coming out<br> of Helene's on Park Avenue. . .<br> . . .l ran into a woman<br> with her dog on a leash.<br> -l ran right into the leash.<br> -Oh, Judith--!<br> l didn't hurt the dog,<br> but the woman was furious.<br> Confidentially, darling,<br> this is more than a hangover.<br> lf you don't tell Parsons<br> these things, l will.<br> No you won't, Ann.<br> You're my best and my truest friend,<br> and you won't tell a soul.<br> l wouldn't have told you except. . . .<br> Well, l won't have a dumb animal<br> blamed for my mistake.<br> Yes, Elizabeth, what is it?<br> -Dr. Parsons is here.<br> -Dr. Par--?<br> l promised him you'd go to<br> a specialist about that giddiness.<br> But l haven't any time for doctors.<br> Martha, bring my things.<br> Listen, darling,<br> you may be really ill.<br> l haven't time to be ill.<br> lt's just some minor nonsense.<br> Very well.<br> lf you're going up to town, l'm going.<br> l won't have another tumble<br> ruin your pretty clothes.<br> Don't be silly.<br> l'm perfectly all right alone.<br> Oh, you're as stubborn as a mule.<br> -Are we ready?<br> -She says she's not going.<br> Thank you, Martha.<br> Darling, l've got so much to do.<br> You have the big specialist<br> examine her.<br> Goodbye, children.<br> Careful.<br> No, l'm sorry, Dr. Parsons,<br> l'm afraid it would be useless.<br> Dr. Steele has closed<br> his office, you know.<br> Permanently.<br> No, he's not coming back.<br> -You're welcome.<br> -Sounds good, eh, Wainwright?<br> -l'm gonna cry in a minute.<br> -l gotta be out in 45 minutes.<br> What shall l do<br> with this case of Dr. Parsons'?<br> He's worried. He asked me<br> to hold you here by force if necessary.<br> You tell Dr. Parsons l waited<br> nine years to catch this train.<br> l'm not gonna miss it just because<br> some nitwit fell off her horse.<br> Listen to this:<br> ''Miss Judith Traherne, daughter of the<br> late sportsman and wire manufacturer. ''<br> -lmagine putting that in a case history.<br> -You have Dr. Carter waiting for you.<br> Say, l'm awfully sorry, doctor. l believe<br> when l left, you were calling me an idiot.<br> The boys at the club<br> were talking about you.<br> -They won't believe it.<br> -What?<br> A man in your position<br> giving up a practice like this.<br> Joe, what do you know<br> about brain surgery?<br> Well, l think if l had the surgical courage,<br> l'd be in it.<br> To go inside a human's skull. . .<br> . . .and tinker with the machinery<br> that makes the whole works go.<br> -That is romance, isn't it?<br> -Romance, huh?<br> There's your romance.<br> -Florist bill?<br> -Yes.<br> Flowers for my last patient.<br> He was a gifted young composer.<br> The night before the operation,<br> he started a new composition.<br> He didn't finish it.<br> -Maybe you read about it in the papers.<br> -Yes.<br> The operation was a brilliant success.<br> But the patient just happened to die.<br> -That's a pretty old joke, Fred.<br> -ls it?<br> Look at any brain surgeon's<br> mortality rate. . .<br> . . .you'll find out<br> just how unfunny it is.<br> Are you quitting because<br> you've lost your nerve?<br> What?<br> -What else can a man think?<br> -l'm going back to medicine.<br> -What do you mean, medicine?<br> -A little laboratory on a farm in Vermont.<br> Medical Research Bureau is backing me.<br> Fisher will do the pathology.<br> lncidentally, the best man<br> in the country.<br> How many men would give their eyeteeth<br> for a practice you're throwing away?<br> -What is this research, actually?<br> -Cells.<br> -Cells?<br> -Brain cells.<br> Why do healthy, normal cells go berserk,<br> grow wild? Do you know?<br> -No.<br> -Nobody knows!<br> But we call them cysts and gliomas<br> and tumors and cancers.<br> We hope to cure with the knife<br> when we don't even know the cause.<br> Our patients have faith in us<br> because we're doctors and. . . .<br> Tell the boys they can split up<br> my practice. And welcome.<br> You and Pasteur.<br> Someday, somebody will discover<br> a serum that will be to these growths. . .<br> . . .what insulin is to diabetes<br> and antitoxin is to diphtheria.<br> And maybe earn his title of<br> Doctor of Medicine.<br> -Yes?<br> -Dr. Parsons is here.<br> -He is?<br> -He insists.<br> Well, l suppose l should be polite.<br> -l must be going.<br> -Your train.<br> Yes, l know.<br> -So long, Fred, old boy. You'll be back.<br> -Don't hold your breath.<br> -Good luck, old man.<br> -Thanks.<br> -Fred, can't you put this thing off?<br> -Sorry, doctor, l've closed my office.<br> -Have you read the case history?<br> -Oh, you mean this gossip sheet?<br> -A wire manufacturer's daughter?<br> -Oh, please, never mind that.<br> This girl's desperately ill.<br> l've been watching her like a hawk,<br> and she's been losing ground each day.<br> Well, if two minutes<br> will do you any good, l'll talk.<br> -What's this about headaches?<br> -She's been having them persistently.<br> -Even before the accident, l suspect.<br> -Before?<br> She calls them hangovers.<br> Three weeks? And you wait until now?<br> You don't know that girl.<br> She's a very stubborn patient.<br> Only yesterday she went to a revival<br> of Cyrano in the afternoon. . .<br> . . .and played bridge half the night.<br> She won't cooperate.<br> -She won't even tell me anything.<br> -Won't talk, huh?<br> Fred.<br> We're old friends, and l'm desperate.<br> l brought this little girl into the world.<br> Took care of her father until he died.<br> lf she's such a great horsewoman,<br> why was she thrown?<br> That's it.<br> lt was a queer sort of accident.<br> She crashed into<br> the right wing of a jump. . .<br> . . .almost as if she'd held her horse<br> deliberately at it.<br> l was there. l saw it.<br> -You're sure it was the right side?<br> -Yes. Why?<br> ln that case, your best bet<br> is to get in touch with Findlay.<br> -Findlay's in Europe.<br> -All right. Then get Park.<br> l don't want Park<br> or any of the rest of them.<br> Hang it all, they're no better than l am.<br> l want you.<br> lf l start making exceptions,<br> l'll be stuck here another nine years.<br> Fred, you're always talking about<br> the obligation of doctors to humanity.<br> -Well, Fred, there is humanity.<br> -Sorry, doctor.<br> lt can't be done.<br> -l told you l've closed my office.<br> -This is ridiculous.<br> -l'm late already.<br> -Judy, please.<br> This is Dr. Steele.<br> -How do you do? My name's Traherne.<br> -How do you do?<br> Judith Traherne,<br> or don't names matter?<br> To that cold, scientific eye of yours,<br> we're just guinea pigs, aren't we?<br> -Glad to have met you.
