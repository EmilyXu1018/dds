Red light on.<br> Battle stations.<br> - Let her blow.<br> - Blow all tanks.<br> She's rising.<br> - Easy.<br> - Starboard planes down 15.<br> - 270 meters!<br> - First watch, stand by.<br> Start up engines?<br> - Go ahead. Both main engines.<br> - This is it, boys.<br> Yeah.<br> They're going!<br> I've never heard such sweet music<br> in all my life.<br> They're running!<br> They won't catch us this time.<br> Not this time!<br> Keep going and get us back.<br> That's an order!<br> Right full rudder.<br> Come to 320.<br> Jesus that's good!<br> They haven't spotted us.<br> They're snoring in their bunks.<br> They're drinking in the bar.<br> Celebrating our sinking!<br> Not yet, my friends!<br> - Boys, here's to home!<br> - And an end to the war.<br> Let's pray the engines hold out.<br> With a bit of luck...<br> ...we'll make it back home.<br> Third U-boat flotilla<br> welcome back home.
