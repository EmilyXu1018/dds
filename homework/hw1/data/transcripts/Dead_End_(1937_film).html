                        -You know Mom hates when I'm late.<br> -I told you...<br> we should have left earlier.<br> It's the same damn thing every year.<br> It's always: "Where are my<br> blue shoes, dear?"<br> Or: "Dad, I can't find<br> my Marilyn Bronson CD."<br> -Marilyn Manson.<br> -Whatever her name is.<br> -She's a guy, dad.<br> -Marilyn? A guy?<br> What's the world coming to?<br> -Oh, boy...<br> -Are you all right, darling?<br> Yeah.<br> Dad! Dad!<br> Oh, God!<br> My God, what happened?<br> -Are we there yet?<br> -ls anybody hurt?<br> -Marion, are you okay?<br> -Are you crazy?<br> -You almost killed us!<br> -I'm sorry. I must have dozed off.<br> I hope you slept well. Maybe<br> I should whip you up some breakfast.<br> Nobody is hurt.<br> Get off my back, all right?<br> For Pete's sakes, why don't you<br> let someone else drive, for once?<br> Don't worry.<br> That woke me up.<br> The pie is probably ruined.<br> -Oh, Jesus!<br> -What is that?<br> -It's pumpkin and chocolate.<br> -Smells like ass.<br> I'd better go out and check the car.<br> The son of a bitch didn't even stop!<br> -Where are we?<br> -We're on the road.<br> -What does it look like?<br> -What happened to the lnterstate?<br> I thought we could take<br> the back-way for a change.<br> What's wrong with the lnterstate?<br> We've taken it for years!<br> I was bored.<br> And I didn't wanna... fall asleep.<br> -That seemed to work.<br> -All right.<br> Car looks okay.<br> No damage.<br> -Want me to take the wheel, dad?<br> -No, thank you, dear.<br> -I'm growing attached to this car.<br> -Here we go again.<br> Did you or did you not put<br> the Mercedes in the junkyard?<br> -lt wasn't my fault!<br> -I'm just teasing you, sweetheart.<br> There certainly aren't<br> very many people on this road.<br> It's Christmas Eve. Most people<br> are at home, with their families.<br> -Damn, I'm starving!<br> -Me too.<br> I hope your mother doesn't get<br> experimental with that turkey.<br> Look, can we drop the subject?<br> I don't feel very good.<br> Are you okay, honey-bunny?<br> You want us to stop?<br> Long car rides make me queasy. And<br> all this talk food isn't helping any.<br> -How about a couple of bookers?<br> -Shut up, Richard!<br> -Or some Macaroni and dick-cheese.<br> -Richard, that's disgusting!<br> But, mom, there really is a cheese<br> called dick-cheese. Chinese make it.<br> You've had dick-cheese before,<br> right, Brad?<br> -Grow up, Richard.<br> -It's 7:30 already, darling.<br> I'm aware of that, Laura. I thought<br> we'd come to a junction by now.<br> Jesus, Laura, do you have<br> to suck on it like that?<br> -That's the way I drink.<br> -All right, you guys. Calm down.<br> -Take it easy.<br> -Marion is right.<br> When I played baseball, they taught<br> us this technique to help us relax.<br> I still use it sometimes.<br> You breathe in deeply through your<br> nose and out through your mouth.<br> Thank you, Brad.<br> Yeah, thanks, Brad.<br> -Can I ask you a question, though?<br> -Sure.<br> Was your entire school gay,<br> or was it just the baseball team?<br> -Richard!<br> -What?<br> Richard, it's a technique we use<br> to helps us get in what we call...<br> ..."The Zone".<br> -The Homo Zone?<br> Richard!<br> This is such a beautiful night!<br> Does anybody know the name of that<br> really bright star right in front of us?<br> There's 1 50 billion stars<br> up there, for Christ's sake.<br> That one I know. That bright one is<br> the North Star. The only one I know.<br> Thank you.<br> -Let's sing a song, everybody.<br> -Okay. What?<br> -How about "Yellow Submarine"?<br> -We always do that one.<br> -Brad, how about "Y.M.C.A"?<br> -It's Christmas, so how about...<br> "Jingle Bells"?<br> Come on. Come on.<br> You like that part, don't you?<br> Why did you stop?<br> A woman.<br> I saw a woman in the forest.<br> -Cool. Dad is tripping out.<br> -Richard.<br> -Are you sure, dad?<br> -Well, yeah.<br> Dressed in white.<br> She was holding something.<br> Fuck!<br> Hi there.<br> We are a little lost.<br> You wouldn't happen to know the<br> quickest way back to the highway?<br> Are you all right?<br> Did you have<br> an accident or something?<br> Okay. Anybody got a cell phone?<br> -No signal.<br> -We just passed the cabin.<br> Maybe there's a phone. Richard, be<br> a gentleman and make room for her.<br> -Let Brad be the gentleman.<br> -What's your problem, man?<br> Relax, buddy.<br> Breath in slowly through your nose<br> and out deeply through your ass!<br> -It's all right, Mrs. Harrington.<br> -I'll walk.<br> -I could use the fresh air, anyway.<br> -You're not walking by yourself.<br> -I wanna be alone.<br> -Marion!<br> -Let me tell you something, smart guy.<br> -What?<br> Keep busting my balls and I'll<br> take you out of the game for good.<br> -Understand me?<br> -Yes, sir!<br> We'll meet you down there in<br> just a minute. Okay, honey?<br> Okay.<br> All right.<br> Okay, we'll see you there, honey.<br> Shit!<br> Would you like a nice<br> hot cup of coffee?<br> I think she's in shock. We should<br> have asked Marion what to do.<br> Honey, we don't need a shrink.<br> We'll call 91 1.<br> -Okay.<br> -They'll know how to handle it.<br> Damn! Fucking stinks in here.<br> It's the baby...<br> jack-ass.<br> -Where are you going, sweetie?<br> -Away from you guys.<br> Teenagers.<br> What's your name?<br> Where do you live?<br> -She's not gonna be much help.<br> -No.<br> Hello, Miss July.<br> Does anybody live here?<br> Maybe it's one of those old<br> forest ranger stations.<br> Jesus, Laura.<br> You scared the shit out of me.<br> Sorry. They have very interesting<br> wall hangings, these rangers.<br> So, what's his name?<br> Do it, baby.<br> You got a ring. You married?<br> Marion and I are getting married.<br> Actually...<br> don't say anything but I'm proposing<br> to her tonight at her grandmother's.<br> Remember when you said you would<br> kill yourself if I ever left you?<br> I hope that was just<br> a figure of speech, 'cause...<br> Brad, we've had some<br> great times together, but...<br> I think we need to go on<br> with our lives separately.<br> Shit.<br> -Damn!<br> -Was there no dial tone?<br> No, Laura, I just forgot<br> the number for 91 1.<br> It's Amy.<br> My little girl.<br> Her name is Amy.<br> -She's so cold.<br> -Not surprised. It's freezing here.<br> -You hold her.<br> -No.<br> I'm not really a baby kind of guy.<br> How does she breathe with<br> all those blanket on her face?<br> Don't worry.<br> She's dead.<br> That's a good one.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Shit!<br> -What the hell was that?<br> -Richard!<br> Richard!<br> -Yeah, I'm here!<br> -Get over here.<br> Where's Brad and the lady?<br> -Brad!<br> -Are you okay?<br> -Yeah, I'm fine. What's going on?<br> -Brad!<br> Hey, dickhead!<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<br> -Dad?<br> -What?<br> -They got Brad.<br> -What are you talking about?<br> -I saw Brad in a car! We gotta go.<br> -What car?<br> We've gotta go!<br> Frank, slow down.<br> You are gonna kill us all.<br> You saw a car driving by<br> and Brad was in the back of it?<br> -Yes.<br> -I don't get that! Why...<br> I saw him. They were hurting him.<br> You have to stop them!<br> -Okay! Where the hell did they go?<br> -Maybe they took a side road.<br> Did you see one?<br> Me neither.<br> -At least you don't drive like a pussy.<br> -Shut up, asshole!<br> -What's going on?<br> -Why did you stop?<br> Laura, give me the flashlight, please.<br> Where's he going?<br> -Why did he stop?<br> -Just a minute.<br> Stay back. Stay back!<br> Don't come over here,<br> for God's sake.<br> -Fuck me!<br> -Oh, God!<br> Richard, get your sister<br> back in the car now.<br> My baby.<br> Do you have her?<br> Jesus Christ...<br> What is he doing?<br> He's trying to get Brad's phone.<br> -With a stick?<br> -You got a better idea?<br> I can't believe I'm gonna do this.<br> Look out.<br> Oh, God...<br> Good boy, Richard.<br> Give it to me.<br> And drop that.<br> That thing is dirty.<br> You got a signal?<br> Thank God. We can call the police<br> and they will tell us what to do.<br> -Okay.<br> -Now.<br> -Now.<br> -Now.<br> Please, somebody help me.<br> Please!<br> God! I can't feel my legs.<br> I can't feel my legs!<br> -Help me! My baby is bleeding!<br> -Who is this?<br> Baby! Wake up!<br> -Anybody, please help us.<br> -Oh, Jesus!<br> Somebody, please, help us.<br> Frank, we gotta get out of here.<br> -Did you get the police?<br> -The phone, it was broken.<br> -Shit.<br> -Please, let's go.<br> We can't leave him here like this.<br> Richard, drag his body off<br> to the side of the road.<br> Jesus, what do I look like?<br> Your fucking janitor?<br> Thank God. Oh, Marion.<br> Are you all right?<br> You're gonna be okay.<br> Marion. Marion?<br> Marion? Wake up.<br> Wake up. Come on, wake up.<br> Wake up! Wake up!<br> Laura! Stop!<br> Stop it!<br> Can't you see she's in shock?<br> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> Dad, that guy...<br> or whoever did that...<br> ...must've used an axe or a chainsaw.<br> -lt was the work of one sick psycho.<br> -Let's get the hell out of here.<br> -Wait. What about that woman?<br> Maybe she got away.<br> -Maybe the psycho got her.<br> -So, you wanna go after him?<br> Richard, get in.<br> We're going to the police.<br> -Why don't we go back to lnterstate?<br> -Your mother lives by the sheriff's.<br> We'll be there in 1 5 minutes.<br> Marcott? Never heard of it.<br> Richard, check the map.<br> Marcott...<br> Gimme a second.<br> -There's no Marcott on this map.<br> -Just give it to me.<br> -I don't see it either.<br> -Maybe that's because it's not there!<br> -Laura, give me the local map.<br> -I didn't bring it.<br> -You didn't bring it?<br> -We never needed it before.<br> -I asked you to. Remember?<br> -I had a lot of things to take care of.<br> -The presents and...<br> -Who gives a fuck about presents?<br> Would you please<br> watch your language?<br> I'm sorry, but how was I supposed to<br> know you're gonna take a shortcut?<br> And how was I supposed to know that<br> you were going to forget the map?<br> We've been coming here for 20 years,<br> and you'd never taken a shortcut.<br> I'll bring a globe in case you feel<br> like driving by way of the North Pole!<br> Is there any coffee left?<br> A little.<br> Okay. Pour me some.<br> Let's go to Marcott, then.<br> Is anybody else a bit freaked out<br> we are the only car in the road now?<br> It's Christmas Eve.<br> Yeah. Okay. How long<br> have we been driving?<br> It's 7:30.<br> You said it was 7:30<br> when we took that lady into the car.<br> That damn thing is broken.<br> All right. Who's got a watch?<br> -I have a watch. It stopped at 7:30.<br> -Come on.<br> Don't you guys think that<br> this is just a little wacked?<br> I know you guys think<br> I'm retarded or whatever...<br> but I have a theory and I want you<br> to hear me out, okay?<br> Brad is dead. His body is mutilated<br> and God knows how it got that way.<br> We are the only people out here and<br> all the clocks have stopped at 7:30.<br> This reeks of<br> alien activity, you guys.<br> -Blow me.<br> -What?<br> Nothing.<br> Laura...<br> can you make her stop that, please?<br> -Let her. Maybe it will help.<br> -It's getting on my nerves.<br> I can't believe I fell asleep.<br> -How long was I out?<br> -I don't know. Maybe 1 0 minutes.<br> Are we still on that same road?<br> -Still no Marcott?<br> -No. No Marcott.<br> -I don't understand. Did we pass it?<br> -No, I haven't seen anything.<br> No lights, no signs, no nothing.<br> Shit! What is that?<br> -It's a baby carriage.<br> -I can see it's a baby carriage.<br> -Okay. I'll get out and I'll go see.<br> -No. Don't.<br> -Why?<br> -Just get going. I don't like this.<br> -Richard, come back here! Richard!<br> -Stop yelling in my ear!<br> Richard, come back here!<br> Hey, little guy!<br> Richard! Frank, no!<br> -You guys suck!<br> -I'm gonna kill that kid.<br> Oh, God!<br> -What the hell was that?<br> -Man, that was good!<br> -This is so not funny, Richard!<br> -It's a baby carriage. Why fear?<br> -It's empty.<br> -No shit!<br> -That is so not funny!<br> -Nice job. That was dumb.<br> What is it now?<br> I can't stop thinking about Diane.<br> How are we gonna tell her about Brad?<br> -He was our responsibility.<br> -I don't wanna worry about that now!<br> I just wanna figure out some<br> goddamn way to get out of here.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Talk about a merry<br> fucking Christmas.<br> You are not gonna open that.<br> That's my Uncle Herb's present.<br> I need this a whole hell of a lot more<br> than your Uncle Herb right now.<br> Let's face it. We are lost, Frank.<br> This road is not going to Mom's.<br> Let's turn around.<br> We should turn around, Frank.<br> We just passed a sign.<br> Marcott can't be too far.<br> Hey, Sis.<br> Mom... Mom and Dad are kinda<br> going off the deep end, huh?<br> They are really losing it.<br> This whole thing is<br> pretty fucking crazy, huh?<br> Mare?<br> Mare?<br> Come on, you've gotta snap<br> out of it, okay? You have to.<br> We need you back here.<br> I... I need you.<br> Mom is always going on about<br> what a great shrink you are, so...<br> you are the only person that can<br> figure a way out of this. Damn it!<br> Do you remember when<br> your hamster disappeared...<br> and I told you it had been<br> abducted by aliens?<br> Well, I lied. Okay?<br> It was me.<br> Me and Kevin. We stuck it<br> in the microwave and we fried it.<br> Marion?<br> Dad!<br> Dad, it's here again.<br> Richard, I am fed up<br> with your stupid jokes.<br> -lt wasn't me this time. I swear.<br> -Richard, we do not have time...<br> Christ! I'm telling you the truth,<br> your fucking assholes!<br> Frank, would you say something<br> for once?<br> -I think we'd better get out of here.<br> -Get going.<br> We should have passed<br> a town or a gas station or...<br> a motel, or a crossroads,<br> a junction, something by now!<br> I know. I know.<br> Just calm down, Laura.<br> It's probably one of those closed<br> roads that forest rangers use.<br> God! I just feel like<br> we've been driving forever.<br> What is this forest?<br> Is this like the Amazon?<br> Last year, I had to drive to Lakewood<br> to talk with a client and I went...<br> ...on a very roundabout way.<br> -What you seem to do sometimes.<br> I was driving and driving until I had<br> to turn back to the road I came from.<br> -What are you talking about?<br> -Some of these roads are designed...<br> by engineers who weren't qualified<br> to build a goddamn bird house!<br> -So?<br> -So? That's that!<br> That's that...<br> Lakewood? Isn't there where<br> Sally Schmidt bought her cottage?<br> Yeah, I think so.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> -What was that?<br> -Some kind of a radio talk show.<br> -That was no talk show.<br> -A public radio, or something.<br> Public radio? Right.<br> -No! Damn it!<br> -You just said it was public radio!<br> I don't know what it was!<br> I don't wanna know what it was!<br> I just wanna get to the police<br> before anything else goes wrong.<br> And I thought last year's<br> Christmas was bad.<br> And what was wrong with<br> last year's Christmas?<br> -Let's see... Everything?<br> -I thought last year was great!<br> -We took the lnterstate!<br> -I was talking about Christmas dinner.<br> And what's wrong with my<br> family's Christmas dinners?<br> Your family.<br> Your mother always felt you deserved<br> more than a used car salesman.<br> Now that salesman has become<br> a respected sales manager.<br> So, I'm sorry, baby,<br> but screw your mother!<br> -Anything else?<br> -Your damn brother is a freak too!<br> He jerks off to gun magazines!<br> That is disgusting! That is<br> disgusting and that is not fair!<br> -Mikey has had a lot of hard times!<br> -Poor little Mikey! Poor Mikey!<br> Wht do I have to suffer every time<br> I talk to the son of a bitch?<br> -You are just so sensitive!<br> -I know it's Christmas, Laura.<br> I know it's the season of giving,<br> but I don't give a shit right now!<br> I just wanna get<br> off this goddamn road!<br> -Jesus! Mother of..!

It's just a joint, all right?<br> -Not worse than those pills you take.<br> -My pills are legal!<br> Pregnant.<br> Man, I hope it's a boy.<br> What's up, little critter?<br> I'm your Uncle Dick.<br> That means you'd better<br> show me some respect, huh?<br> Or I will fuck you up.<br> Okay.<br> Are you okay, honey-bunny?<br> -Don't you ever call me that again.<br> -Okay.<br> -Okay, that's fine.<br> -That's what Brad called me.<br> Uncle Dick. Right on.<br> Fuck!<br> I love you.<br> Jesus!<br> Okay. I'm done. Let's go.<br> Richard, we're going!<br> -It's the car!<br> -Oh, my God...<br> Open the door!<br> -Open the door! Open the door!<br> -Laura! Laura!<br> Let's go back and get the car!<br> Dad! Dad!<br> Richard! Richard!<br> Come here!<br> Laura, get in the car now!<br> -Frank...<br> -Get in, we'll get him!<br> -Faster!<br> -lt doesn't go any faster, Laura!<br> -Where is he?<br> -I don't know. I can't see him.<br> The son of a bitch<br> shut off his lights!<br> -They are gonna kill him.<br> -No!<br> -They are gonna kill him!<br> -No, they won't!<br> -Yes, they are!<br> -Calm down, mom!<br> He'll be all right!<br> I'll get him!<br> -lt was Richard!<br> -Shut up! Damn it!<br> It was Richard!<br> Stop the car! Stop the car!<br> Please...<br> My baby!<br> Please...<br> What did they do to you?<br> -Mom...<br> -Come on.<br> Come on, baby. You can wake up.<br> Come one, baby.<br> Laura...<br> -Laura...<br> -What? What?<br> -Mom, he is...<br> -No! No, no...<br> This is one of his jokes, isn't it?<br> You're just like your father.<br> Remember the time that<br> he took me to New Orleans?<br> -We never went to New Orleans.<br> -'Course not. You're not his father.<br> -What?<br> -Richard is not your son.<br> -Mom, what are you talking about?<br> -She's out of her fucking mind.<br> I am not out of my mind.<br> Don't you remember Alan Rickson?<br> -Laura...<br> -What? What?<br> -What did you say?<br> -You remember Alan Rickson?<br> My baby. I don't wanna go.<br> I don't wanna go.<br> -Please, let me stay with him.<br> -Come on.<br> Let me stay...<br> Don't take me from him! Oh, God!<br> Please, I don't wanna go.<br> Please, Frank...<br> -What are we gonna do?<br> -We gotta go to the police.<br> How are we gonna go to the police?<br> We're in the middle of nowhere.<br> -Come on. Let's go, honey.<br> -We can't leave him here.<br> No, we won't.<br> He was my son.<br> He goes with us.<br> What is it?<br> It's what Uncle Mike<br> wanted for Christmas.<br> Thank God for the gun freak.<br> Isn't Michael coming?<br> -Michael? Who the hell is Michael?<br> -It's Richard.<br> His real name is Michael. Because<br> that is what Alan wanted to call him.<br> -Richard is dead!<br> -Okay.<br> Would you like some pie?<br> -lt was that sign again.<br> -How far is this fucking town?<br> -We've been driving for 1 00 miles.<br> -What a wonderful Christmas.<br> I wonder if I should save<br> some pie for Michael?<br> -Do you think she's gonna recover?<br> -I don't know.<br> But she's gonna have to<br> face reality sooner or later.<br> -What a wonderful Chrismtas.<br> -God only knows how she will react.<br> -Can't be any worse.<br> -lt can be much worse.<br> Look, I finished the pie.<br> -Could I have a pen, please?<br> -What for?<br> -I'm gonna do a drawing.<br> -Good, good. Here, my pen.<br> -You are so beautiful, Marion.<br> -Jesus!<br> Let's hope there's<br> a hospital in Marcott.<br> What if we never reach Marcott?<br> What if she gets us first?<br> -Who?<br> -The lady in white.<br> -That woman with the baby?<br> -Yeah, I saw her in the woods...<br> ...right after Richard disappeared.<br> -You saw her?<br> And then I remembered the story<br> my grandfather used to tell me.<br> Used to creep me out<br> every time I heard it.<br> Look. I made a drawing of Brad. This<br> was his leg that was hanging out.<br> -It's for you.<br> -Okay, Mom.<br> Wipe your face.<br> There was this couple that was<br> driving home from a wedding...<br> in Rhode lsland.<br> It was night. It was raining.<br> And they saw a little girl<br> standing by the side of the road.<br> And she was just wandering back<br> and forth, clutching the school book.<br> They stopped and they let her<br> get into the back seat...<br> and they tried to talk to her,<br> but she must have been in shock.<br> They were driving on down the road,<br> all of a sudden they heard a scream...<br> coming from the back seat.<br> They slammed on the brakes,<br> they nearly had an accident.<br> Miraculously, they didn't go over the<br> cliff. They turned to the back seat...<br> the little girl had vanished.<br> There was just her school book<br> there, with her name on it.<br> Barbara Rose.<br> And then they remembered:<br> the entire Rose family had died<br> in a tragic car accident...<br> right at that cliff,<br> five years earlier.<br> Come on! Dad, what are you saying?<br> That that woman is a ghost?<br> Look! We've got potato chips!<br> I'll get them open.<br> I didn't know we had them.<br> -Do you want some?<br> -Mom, don't eat them so fast.<br> -You're gonna make yourself sick.<br> -I am not.<br> Oh, God! We'd better wake up<br> from this nightmare pretty soon.<br> Do you feel better, Laura?<br> Dad, who's Alan Rickson?<br> I have no idea.<br> -What was Mom talking about?<br> -I never heard of any Alan Rickson.<br> She's in shock. She's talking<br> a whole lot of nonsense.<br> -Why would she do that?<br> -You tell me.<br> Wow! Look what I found!<br> Mom, put the gun down.<br> It's dangerous.<br> It's not. It's a toy! It's like<br> the one Michael used to have.<br> -Laura!<br> -I was just kidding!<br> Laura, that is a loaded gun.<br> Put it down.<br> You are just trying to scare me.<br> I don't wanna play with you anymore.<br> -Bang-bang, you are dead!<br> -Okay.<br> Okay, sweetheart. You win.<br> I'm dead.<br> -Do something.<br> -Like what?<br> -You are the shrink.<br> -Student shrink.<br> -Marion...<br> -Mom!<br> -Yes, darling.<br> -We'll play something else now.<br> Remember when<br> we used to play house?<br> I don't wanna play that. I wanna<br> play what Michael and I used to.<br> Laura, this is not a game!<br> Our son is dead!<br> -No.<br> -Richard is dead!<br> Dad!<br> Holy shit!<br> The bitch shot me in the leg!<br> -ls he hurt?<br> -Mom, go back to the car.<br> -It's gonna be all right.<br> -ls he gonna die too?<br> Nobody is gonna die anymore, okay?<br> How does it look, Doc?<br> We'll see.<br> -Hold this. Hold this!<br> -All right.<br> -I have to get the pellets out.<br> -Okay.<br> Light on the wound, please.<br> -Have you done this before?<br> -No, this is my first time.<br> -Shit!<br> -Light on the wound!<br> Right.<br> -Okay, brace yourself.<br> -Why?<br> Brace yourself.<br> Oh, God!<br> That hurt more than the shot!<br> Okay, lift your leg up.<br> All right. All right.<br> You should be all right now.<br> -Give me the keys.<br> -I'll drive.<br> Easy on the bottle there.<br> -You know of a better pain killer?<br> -Driving isn't helping any.<br> It helps.<br> I don't understand it.<br> We should have passed<br> a side-road by now.<br> Your grandma's place is<br> probably miles behind us.<br> That's it!<br> This must be a military road!<br> You think so?<br> That's why we never see military<br> trucks. Always on roads isolated!<br> Marcott must be a military base.<br> That's why it's not even on the map.<br> -I guess so.<br> -Of course! That's it! That's it!<br> Dad?<br> -Dad!<br> -It's okay, honey.<br> -I'm here. I'm here.<br> -Thank God! I thought that...<br> Your leg...<br> -Are you okay?<br> -That's not so bad.<br> I think we finally got some<br> good news. Come here.<br> Look. Earlier, I showed<br> your mother the North Star.<br> It was on our right side.<br> It still is.<br> That means we've been<br> headed constantly west.<br> So, if we left the lnterstate<br> somewhere around here...<br> and we headed constantly<br> west on this road...<br> the road must go right<br> straight to the sea.<br> Marcott must be somewhere on<br> the coast. It makes perfect sense.<br> It must be a naval base.<br> Okay, okay. So how long<br> until we get there?<br> We have about half a tank of gas,<br> we covered 1 50 miles on this road.<br> That leaves us another 40 or 50<br> miles until we get to the coast.<br> We can reach Marcott<br> within an hour, tops.<br> You're a genius.<br> But you know, I'm more than a little<br> concerned about your mother.<br> -Mom?<br> -You're awake?<br> -I slept like a log.<br> -How are you feeling?<br> I feel... okay...<br> considering...<br> Now we have got...<br> to stick together. We have got to<br> support each other in our grief.<br> Would you like me to drive, darling?<br> -We should reach Marcott soon.<br> -Oh, good!<br> -You look not very well.<br> -She's okay.<br> Frank, you know,<br> you are a wonderful father.<br> And a wonderful husband too.<br> I want you to know that I understand<br> about you and Sally Schmidt.<br> -What?<br> -I know the whole thing.<br> I know how you two used to meet<br> at the Motel 6 on your lunch break.<br> It's okay. I completely understand.<br> I have never been able to fulfill...<br> your sexual fantasies.<br> And I want to promise you...<br> that when we get out of here, you can<br> do anything you want to me, darling.<br> And I mean anything.<br> Anyway, the most important thing...<br> is that the three of us come out<br> of this stronger. What do you think?<br> -Not much.<br> -Good.<br> Now...<br> there's something that has been<br> bothering me ever since I woke up.<br> -What?<br> -Who are these people in the woods?<br> Honey, slow down. They are waving.<br> Hi!<br> Oh, my goodness,<br> why do they look so sad?<br> This is Christmas Eve.<br> Smile!<br> They teach you what to do<br> in this kind of situation?<br> Not to panic.<br> Frank, do you really need to<br> suck on that bottle like that?<br> Frank! It's Jeannine!<br> Quick, stop the car!<br> -Who is Jeannine?<br> -She's my friend!<br> Who died 20 years ago.<br> -And what exactly is your point?<br> -She's dead.<br> -So?<br> -So drop it!<br> If the dead are alive, maybe<br> we should check out Richard.<br> -Are you crazy?<br> -Think he is comfortable back there?<br> Mom, if he was alive, don't<br> you think we would here him?<br> Your brother was burned alive.<br> How could he talk?<br> -Shut up, Laura!<br> -Easy, dad.<br> -Okay.<br> -She's driving me crazy.<br> -Could I go see Jeannine now?<br> -No, you can't!<br> -Yes, I can.<br> -No, you can't!<br> -Yes, I can.<br> -No, you...<br> I'm gonna go now.<br> Oh, my God! Dad, stop the car!<br> -Mom!<br> -Laura! Laura!<br> -Mom!<br> -Laura!<br> Mom!<br> Oh, God! God! Laura!<br> -Where the hell did she go?<br> -Mom?<br> Mom!<br> -Maybe she ran away.<br> -Oh, Marion...<br> -Maybe she went into the woods.<br> -Marion, I'm going 60!<br> -She would have broken her neck!<br> -Then where is she?<br> Maybe the lady got her.<br> It's the black car.<br> You son of a bitch. I'm gonna<br> blow that bastard's head off.<br> -Marion, where's the ammo?<br> -It's here. I hid it from mom.<br> Come on!<br> I got him!<br> -Mom!<br> -Laura.<br> -Thank God.<br> -Mom, are you all right?<br> I'm okay. My head hurts a little<br> but I'm fine.<br> Sweetheart.<br> Honey, honey.<br> You got something on your...<br> Oh, my God! Oh, God!<br> -Something wrong with my hair?<br> -Oh, God!<br> Alan!<br> -Finally!<br> -No! Stop!<br> -Alan!<br> -Stop! Stop!<br> Laura...<br> -Daddy?<br> -Laura...<br> I made the cheerleading squad.<br> This is the happiest day<br> of my life.<br> Laura...<br> Dad! Dad!<br> Give me that gun!<br> Stop it, dad! Stop it!<br> -You bastard! Stop it!<br> -Marion...<br> I'm gonna have a baby. You can't<br> leave us. You can't leave us.<br> -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<br> -I've already lost my mother...<br> and my brother and my boyfriend.<br> I don't wanna lose you.<br> -I don't wanna lose you.<br> -She's gonna get us all anyway.<br> No. No one is gonna get us,<br> as long as we keep moving.<br> Every time we've stopped, someone's<br> gotten killed. We have to keep driving.<br> We are going to Marcott.<br> Let's put your mother in the car.<br> -You got a cigarette?<br> -ln my coat.<br> Alan Rickson was a friend of mine,<br> back in Detroit.<br> You don't have to say anything, Dad.<br> Then one day he came to me<br> for some advice.<br> He said that he was<br> in love with a woman.<br> Didn't mention her name.<br> He said that she was married<br> and that she loved him too.<br> And he wanted to know<br> what he should do about it.<br> And I remember what<br> I said to him...<br> "You only live once, buddy.<br> Go for it.<br> Just go. You go and you see her,<br> and if she loves you...<br> she will leave her husband<br> and she will go with you."<br> -I'm sorry, Dad.<br> -Only talked to him once after that.<br> He said the woman had decided she<br> didn't want to leave her husband.<br> She already had a kid.<br> A little girl.<br> She didn't want to lose her.<br> Last time I ever saw Alan.<br> Always wondered<br> why he never kept in touch.<br> Why did you do that?<br> If you are scared,<br> alcohol will only make it worse.<br> -You think I'm scared?<br> -You don't need to pretend.<br> -It's okay.<br> -No, it's not.<br> Have you looked at<br> the odometer lately?<br> We've driven 60 miles since<br> the last time we checked the map.<br> I know.<br> -We should have reached the coast.<br> -I know.<br> Maybe I miscalculated a little bit.<br> Maybe.<br> Maybe the North Star<br> doesn't indicate north.<br> Maybe the map maker was drunk.<br> Maybe the moon's made out of cheese.<br> Who knows? Everything is so<br> fucked up on this goddamn road!<br> After all, we don't have to drive<br> to get to Marcott.<br> -Maybe there's another way out.<br> -Like what, dad? Flying?<br> No. Walking.<br> Through the woods.<br> -This is insane.<br> -Agreed. Agreed.<br> -You ready?<br> -We should at least wait until sunrise.<br> Remember what you said? Every time<br> we stopped, somebody died.<br> Let's keep moving.<br> Did you hear that?<br> -Of course I heard that.<br> -What is it?<br> I don't know. We're in the woods,<br> Dad. It could be anything.<br> A branch falling, a rat or something,<br> maybe a bird.<br> Remember what Laura said<br> about all the faces in the forest?<br> Are there any ghosts<br> in the woods tonight?<br> -Come on, I'm waiting!<br> -Don't...<br> ever, ever do that again.<br> You hear me?<br> -What is the matter with you?<br> -We shouldn't have left the car.<br> That's what's the matter with me!<br> The more distance we put between us<br> and the road, the better off we'll be.<br> Goddamn! Shit!<br> Shit! Shit!<br> -Are you all right?<br> -Yeah, just dandy.<br> -What the hell is that?<br> -You found us a fence!<br> A fence. Good, good.<br> There must be a farm<br> on the other side. It's not that tight.<br> I'll hold it up.<br> You crawl under. Go on.<br> -Now you hold it for me.<br> -Okay.<br> Dad! Look!<br> -Hello!<br> -Hello!<br> Hello!<br> We're here! We're here!<br> No!<br> No, it can't be!<br> How can it be? How can...<br> How can it be?<br> -Maybe we got lost.<br> -lf we were lost...<br> we would have come out<br> at the same side of the road.<br> -Somebody is fucking with us.<br> -Calm down.<br> I don't wanna calm down!<br> I want this shit to stop!<br> -It's still locked.<br> -So what?<br> So who turned on the lights?<br> Who turned them on?<br> Laura?<br> -I'm not getting back in that car.<br> -Me neither.<br> What are you writing?<br> Things I wanna do<br> when this is over.<br> So?<br> Do you want me to help you?<br> -What about playing bridge?<br> -How old do you think I am?<br> I wanna do something... cool.<br> I wanna buy an Atari, a computer,<br> a bunch of videogames.<br> If you wanna do something cool,<br> then I'd go for the PlayStation.<br> What's that?<br> Never mind.<br> Atari is cooler anyway.<br> Maybe buy some of those<br> Marilyn Bronson CDs.<br> Manson.<br> -What did you write?<br> -That's none of your business.<br> Stop!<br> -What's going on?<br> -I knew it.<br> Somebody is playing with us.<br> That's the same cabin as before.<br> There's probably 1 00 ranger stations<br> on this road. It can't be the same one.<br> No, it can't be. But it is.<br> -Oh, shit! Go get the flashlight.<br> -No.<br> Go get the flashlight!<br> Marion?<br> What are you doing?<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> -There's someone in here! I know it!<br> -Dad, stop it!<br> We are damned.<br> Dad, come on.<br> No road goes on forever.<br> Where the fog come from?<br> -There's no fog, dad.<br> -No fog?<br> Somebody needs to pay a visit to<br> Dr. Sacks to get her eyes checked.<br> -Where's the whiskey?<br> -I threw it away, remember?<br> What?<br> You threw away my whiskey?<br> My whiskey? Ungrateful little brat.<br> -Dad, calm down.<br> -You think because I'm weak...<br> ...you can start messing with me?<br> -Dad, listen to me.<br> What are you doing?<br> That'll teach you to think twice<br> before you touch my booze.<br> Dad, please. Please.<br> Shut up! Shut up!<br> God damn you!<br> Marion?<br> Marion?<br> Marion? My baby!<br> Oh, God, what did I do?<br> What did I do?<br> Oh, my baby...<br> So, you've come for her, huh?<br> Well, you'll have to kill me first,<br> you bitch!<br> Why us, huh? Why?<br> What did we ever do to you?<br> All we wanted was a nice Christmas.<br> Is that too much to ask,<br> to have a nice Christmas?<br> Come on out!<br> Where are you hiding?<br> Come on! I'll give you a taste<br> of your own medicine, you bitch!<br> I'll send you right straight back...<br> Dad? Dad?<br> He is dead.<br> -He is dead!<br> -Oh, God!<br> Get started!<br> Come on. Come on!<br> Start! Come on!<br> Let's end it!<br> Come on!<br> Stop playing with me!<br> Please! Please!<br> He's not here for you!<br> Dad!<br> Don't try to talk.<br> Everything is gonna be okay now.<br> -Just try to get some rest, okay?<br> -I'm pregnant.<br> It's all right, Marion.<br> We know.<br> Both of you are gonna be fine.<br> -How is she?<br> -Are you a member of the family?<br> No, I'm the one who found them.<br> I reported the accident.<br> She was lucky, she was<br> thrown out of the car.<br> Been in a coma for a few hours, but<br> she's gonna be fine. A few broken...<br> ...ribs and a concussion.<br> -But the others died.<br> -Do they know what happened?<br> -According to the police...<br> father must have fallen asleep<br> and crashed into an oncoming car.<br> -A woman and her baby.<br> -They died too.<br> Well...<br> thank you. Thank you for<br> what you did. Doctor...<br> -Marcott. Helen Marcott.<br> -Thank you, Doctor Marcott.<br> Not again.<br> Shit.<br> Hey!<br> -Nice car.<br> -Yeah, I'm a collector.<br> -Can I give you a lift?<br> -Why not?<br> Must have been a messy one.<br> Broken glass everywhere.<br> I should be at home<br> stuffing myself today.<br> So should they.<br> Did you drop this?<br> No, what have you got there?<br>
