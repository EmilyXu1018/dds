I understand.<br> It's a long drive from Slidell. "<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Father.<br> - Sister...<br> - Helen Prejean.

He ought to be sitting here.<br> He went nuts on me.<br> I was scared. Did what he said,<br> held that boy back. He killed them.<br> You watched him kill these kids?<br> I'll tell you the truth, ma'am.<br> Me and Carl were loaded on downs,<br> acid, booze when this happened.<br> I hadn't slept in two nights.<br> I was out of my head.<br> But I didn't kill them.<br> I didn't kill nobody.<br> I swear to God I didn't.<br> Ali.<br> - Ali?<br> - Her name.<br> She's cute.<br> Yeah, she's 11 or 12, I don't know.<br> She was born first time<br> I was in prison. I seen her once.<br> When was that?<br> When she was 3.<br> - Do you write her?<br> - I don't know where she is.<br> She's in Texas somewhere.<br> Foster parents.<br> Go on and finish up now, Sister.<br> Look.<br> They're about to go<br> on a killing spree here.<br> They're zapping<br> this guy Tobias tonight.<br> Guards are taking bets on who's next.<br> I'm at even odds. It's not good.<br> I got two chances: a pardon board<br> or a federal appeals court.<br> I wrote the motion on the appeal,<br> but I need someone to file it.<br> Can you help me with that?<br> You know how to write a motion?<br> You got no choice,<br> you learn the law real fast.<br> Call it special motivation.<br> I've been on death row six years.<br> I studied every law book<br> I could get my hands on.<br> I got this stuff about my case:<br> trial transcripts, legal papers.<br> They might help you get<br> ahold of my case faster.<br> You drop a dime and get a lawyer,<br> we can file a motion for appeal.<br> - You ain't coming back.<br> - Are these your only copies?<br> No, but they're hard to come by.<br> I don't want to waste them.<br> I'll do my best.<br> And I appreciate your trust.<br> I'll tell you,<br> I don't trust nobody in here.<br> But you don't kiss my ass or preach<br> that hellfire brimstone crap.<br> I respect that.<br> You got guts.<br> You live in a neighborhood<br> with every nigger carrying a gun.<br> Come on, Helen, hit it!<br> Playing possum, huh?<br> Think you can trick us,<br> you dumb animal?<br> Think you can fool us?<br> How fast was I going?<br> - Seventy-five miles an hour, ma'am.<br> - Wow.<br> - You a nun?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Never gave a ticket to no nun before.<br> Gave a ticket to a guy<br> from the IrS one time.<br> Got audited the next year.<br> Tell you what, Sister,<br> I'll let this slide.<br> - But keep your speed down.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> On Friday night, Walter Delacroix,<br> age 17, and Hope Percy, 18...<br> ...had been two happy people<br> celebrating a life-turning point.<br> They were shot twice at close range in<br> the back of the head with a .22 rifle.<br> In addition to murder, Poncelet<br> and Vitello face six counts...<br> ...of aggravated kidnapping<br> and one charge of aggravated rape.<br> -- handcuff the man and molest--<br> -- four weeks before the murder<br> the two men allegedly cut...<br> ...a wide path of terror<br> across the area.<br> A police spokesman said today,<br> in the wake of the murders--<br> Poncelet addressed<br> the judge as "Cap"...<br> ...and smirked when they found him<br> guilty of murder today.<br> Poncelet claims Vitello<br> killed both of them.<br> - Y'all think he's lying.<br> - Vitello accuses Poncelet.<br> Both say the other did the killing.<br> Somebody's lying to somebody.<br> They were both there. We know that.<br> Then how is it possible one guy<br> gets life, the other death?<br> Probably a stronger case<br> against Poncelet.<br> Vitello had a better lawyer.<br> Created a reasonable doubt<br> in the jury's mind.<br> And Vitello gets life, Poncelet death.<br> Bad luck.<br> He needs help, Sister.<br> There's a lawyer, Hilton Barber.<br> He's aware of the case, told me no.<br> Maybe you can change his mind.<br> With the aim of a new trial<br> and getting him out?<br> I'm not sure I want to run<br> into this guy on the street.<br> He's not getting off.<br> He was an accomplice. That's life.<br> Life sentences in a<br> Louisiana prison is for real.<br> I'm trying to stop the State<br> from killing him.<br> You want out?<br> It's cool with me.<br> You don't have to go back there.<br> Get tough on sentencing.<br> Get tough on lenient parole boards.<br> Get tough on judges<br> who pass light sentences.<br> - Hello.<br> - Sister Helen?<br> - Who's this?<br> - Matt Poncelet.<br> I know I'm on death row, but there's<br> guys been here years and years.<br> I didn't know this was coming.<br> They set a date.<br> - For what?<br> - They're gonna kill me.<br> It's gonna go down on the 13th.<br> You need a lawyer<br> to get a pardon hearing.<br> I'd do it myself if they'd let me.<br> But they say, "No lawyer, no hearing. "<br> I think I know of a lawyer<br> that may be able to help you.<br> And I'll do my best, all right?<br> Sister, come through for me.<br> You're all I got.<br> They got me on a greased rail<br> to the death house.<br> I ain't heard from you.<br> You ain't fading out on me, are you?<br> I'll get you the lawyer.<br> Just try not to worry.<br> - I'll call you soon.<br> - All right. Bye.<br> As far as I'm concerned, it's time<br> the State got with the program.<br> Call me sentimental,<br> but I'd rather see him fry.<br> Barring any last-minute<br> appeals or stays...<br> ...he'll die under the State's new<br> execution procedure.: lethal injection.<br> - Hello.<br> - Luis, this is Helen.<br> I need the name of that lawyer<br> you wanted me to talk to.<br> - How long you been doing this?<br> - Doing this?<br> - Counseling death row inmates.<br> - I'm not counseling him.<br> - I hardly know him, just met him once.<br> - What's your impression?<br> I don't know if I like him.<br> He needs help.<br> Best thing was to bring him to you.<br> Well, I'll do my best.<br> Courts don't want to hear appeals<br> on death penalty cases.<br> You can even have<br> new evidence of innocence...<br> ...and the court won't hear the case.<br> We're the pariahs. We're--<br> "Have many rabbit."<br> Think that's a "for sale" sign<br> or a cry for help?<br> Or is it bragging?<br> lmagine that poor guy.<br> Bought two rabbits a year ago<br> and now he's overrun.<br> Coming like popcorn.<br> Day before the governor<br> runs for reelection...<br> ...they set a date for my execution.<br> Show how tough he is on crime.<br> I agree with you. Politics did<br> play a big part in this decision.<br> But the pardon board<br> isn't a place to bring it up.<br> - Why not?<br> - It's full of political appointees.<br> Governor's appointees.<br> They don't want to hear some convicted<br> killer telling them they is bunk.<br> We have to present you as a person<br> and convince them to spare your life.<br> We have to prove I'm innocent.<br> We'll file appeals with<br> the federal and supreme courts...<br> ...but this is a pardon board.<br> They won't care if you shot the gun.<br> They'll be thinking of the crime.<br> And of you as a monster.<br> It's easy to kill a monster<br> but hard to kill a human being.<br> We need people like your mama...<br> ...to speak on your behalf.<br> She should be there.<br> She'll just cry till she can't<br> say nothing, she gonna be so torn up.<br> Be that as it may,<br> your mama should be there.<br> - She'll hear the Delacroixs, the--<br> - If she's not there--<br> Excuse me for butting in.<br> You're right, it's gonna<br> be upsetting for her.<br> But she's your mama, Matthew.<br> Your mama.<br> She should have the opportunity<br> to speak for her child.<br> - She'll just blubber her head off.<br> - Well, she has the right to do that.<br> What if you die and she hasn't<br> had a chance to speak for you?<br> Don't you think it'll eat at her,<br> wondering if she could've saved you?<br> I'll think about it,<br> but I got my pride.<br> I won't kiss ass in front of these<br> people. I won't kiss nobody's ass.<br> - What are you making, Kenitra?<br> - An Easter card for Mama.<br> - What's that?<br> - Easter Bunny going down a chimney.<br> Happy Easter.<br> Yes?<br> Mrs. Poncelet?<br> No.<br> Mrs. Poncelet, please.<br> Don't live here.<br> Who is it?<br> My name is Sister Helen Prejean.<br> I know your son Matthew.<br> Happy Easter.<br> - You sure you're a Sister?<br> - Yes.<br> - You're not from the TV?<br> - No.<br> You sure?<br> How do you know Mattie?<br> I met him on death row.<br> Well, you never know<br> who's at your front door.<br> So, what do you want? Mattie send<br> you for money, for cigarettes?<br> No.<br> So, what do you want?<br> You know they set the date<br> for Matthew's execution.<br> Yeah.<br> Prison called, said if it goes down,<br> do I got death insurance?<br> Ha! What a laugh.<br> I ain't even got food money.<br> His pardon board hearing<br> is this Wednesday...<br> ...and his lawyer thinks it'd be<br> a good idea if you were there.<br> What does Mattie think?<br> He's worried.<br> He wants to protect you.<br> Well, it's a little late for that.<br> That show Inside Crime<br> did a thing on Mattie...<br> ...and told how I tried<br> to help him and everything.<br> A regular Ma Barker or something.<br> Now I'm famous.<br> Yesterday, I was in the store...<br> ...and I see these<br> two ladies eyeing me.<br> When I get closer,<br> I hear one of them say:<br> "I just can't wait to hear that<br> they have executed that monster...<br> ...Matthew Poncelet."<br> That's cruel.<br> My boys are having<br> a real hard time at school.<br> Kids picking on them.<br> Beating them up, calling them names.<br> Someone put a dead squirrel<br> inside my little Troy's locker.<br> Poor boy came home crying.<br> What did he ever do to anyone?<br> Just keep trying to figure out<br> what I done wrong.<br> Life's plowed them over. He started<br> getting in trouble when he was 15.<br> - Every kid does when he's 15.<br> - His dad was never around.<br> Most of your kids in the projects<br> are raised by single parents.<br> They're not raping and killing.<br> You're being suckered.<br> There you go again, Louie.<br> What about the parents<br> of these victims?<br> - Are you seeing and counseling them?<br> - You think they'd talk to me?<br> Aren't there people in your<br> neighborhood that need help?<br> Yes, Mom.<br> I'm still working with them.<br> Why visit murderers?<br> They're at the end of the line.<br> For all the energy and resources<br> you're putting into them...<br> ...you could be keeping<br> other kids from going to prison.<br> Mama's friends, the Pierres,<br> read an article...<br> ...which mentioned your name<br> with Poncelet.<br> My name was in the paper?<br> It has nothing to do with that.<br> I am just curious.<br> Helen, what has drawn you to this?<br> Mama, I don't know.<br> I feel caught more than drawn.<br> The man's in trouble and, for some<br> reason, I'm the only one he trusts.<br> Your heart's in the right place...<br> ...but a full heart<br> shouldn't follow an empty head.<br> Or an empty stomach.<br> As a child you always<br> brought home strays.<br> If we'd taken in all those dogs and<br> cats, we couldn't have fed the family.<br> Your heart is large.<br> Just take care that others<br> don't take advantage of it.<br> I'd hate to see that.<br> All right, Mama.<br> My daddy took me to a bar<br> when I was 12...<br> ...and told me to pick my whiskey.<br> There was all these bottles<br> behind the bar and I said:<br> "I'll take that one<br> with the pretty turkey on it."<br> The guys in the bar<br> laughed their butts off.<br> We got drunk as coots that night.<br> My daddy was a good man.<br> Sharecropper, hard worker.<br> That's the one thing I got from him:<br> working hands.<br> - How old were you when he died?<br> - 14.<br> Why's you a nun?<br> I was drawn to it, I guess.<br> That's a hard question to answer.<br> It's like asking why you're a convict.<br> - Bad luck.<br> - Good luck, then.<br> I had a loving family,<br> a lot of support.<br> I guess I felt obliged<br> to give some of it back.<br> Don't you miss having a man?<br> Don't you want to get married,<br> fall in love, have sex?<br> You don't want to talk about it?<br> Well, I have close friends,<br> men and women.<br> I haven't experienced sexual intimacy,<br> but there's other ways of being close.<br> You sharing your dreams,<br> your thoughts, your feelings.<br> That's being intimate too.<br> We got intimacy right now,<br> don't we, Sister?<br> I went to see your mother.<br> She said she'd appear<br> at the pardon board hearing...<br> ...if you want her to.<br> I like being alone with you.<br> You're looking real good to me.<br> Look at you.<br> Death is breathing down your neck...<br> ...and you're playing your<br> little-man-on-the-make games.<br> I'm not here for your amusement,<br> Matthew. Show some respect.<br> Why? Because you're a nun<br> and you wear a little cross?<br> Because I'm a person.<br> Every person deserves respect.<br> What's the answer?<br> What'll it be with your mama?<br> Mattie had a hard life...<br> ...but he was a good boy.<br> When he was 6, he--<br> He--<br> Ladies and gentlemen, let's be honest.<br> You're not gonna find<br> many rich people on death row.<br> Matthew Poncelet's here today<br> because he's poor.<br> Didn't have money so he had<br> to take what the State gave him.<br> He got a tax lawyer who'd never<br> tried a capital case before.<br> An amateur.<br> The jury selection took four hours.<br> The trial lasted five days.<br> The lawyer raised one objection<br> the entire trial.<br> Now, if Matthew<br> had himself some money...<br> ...well, he could've hired<br> a team of crackerjack lawyers...<br> ...and they would have hired top-notch<br> investigators, a ballistics expert...<br> ...a psychologist to compile<br> profiles of desirable jurors.<br> And you can be sure...<br> ...Matthew Poncelet wouldn't be<br> sitting here today before you...<br> ...asking for his life.<br> The death penalty.<br> It's nothing new,<br> been with us for centuries.<br> We've buried people alive,<br> lopped off their heads...<br> ...burned them alive in public,<br> gruesome spectacles.<br> I wanted them to see these pictures.<br> In this century, we kept searching<br> for more and more humane ways...<br> ...of killing people we didn't like.<br> We've shot them with firing squads,<br> suffocated them in gas chambers.<br> But now...<br> Now we have developed a device...<br> ...that is the most humane of all:<br> Lethal injection.<br> We strap the guy up. We anesthetize<br> him with shot number one.<br> Then we give him shot number two<br> which implodes his lungs.<br> And shot number three stops his heart.<br> We put him to death<br> just like an old horse.<br> His face just goes to sleep...<br> ...while inside, his organs<br> are going through Armageddon.<br> His facial muscles would contort, but<br> shot number one relaxes those muscles.<br> So we don't have to see<br> any horror show.<br> We don't have to taste<br> the blood of revenge...<br> ...while this human being's organs<br> writhe, twist, contort.<br> We just sit there quietly,<br> nod our heads and say:<br> "Justice has been done."<br> It has been six years since the<br> brutal and reprehensible murders...<br> ...of Hope Percy and Walter Delacroix.<br> And justice is long past due.<br> Matt Poncelet has had a lengthy,<br> thorough court review.<br> Both a trial and<br> a retrial for sentencing...<br> ...as well as many appeals<br> to state and federal courts...<br> ...and successive petitions<br> filed by Mr. Barber.<br> There's been no doubt in the<br> court's mind about who did the murder.<br> Matthew Poncelet is not a good boy.<br> He is a heartless killer.<br> These murders were calculated,<br> disgusting and cruel.<br> This man shot Walter Delacroix<br> two times in the back of his head.<br> And raped Hope Percy<br> and stabbed her 17 times...<br> ...before shooting this sweet girl<br> two times in the back of the head.<br> These families...<br> ...will never see their children<br> graduate from college.<br> They will never attend their wedding.<br> They will never have Christmas<br> with them again.<br> There will be no grandchildren.<br> All they ask of you is simple justice<br> for their unbearable loss.<br> I ask you to take a breath...<br> ...steel your spine...<br> ...and proceed with the execution<br> of Matthew Poncelet.<br> It's always a good sign<br> when you have to wait.<br> - I don't know if we made any headway.<br> - I thought you did great.<br> It'd be best if they realized their<br> culpability in the death of a man.<br> - Hilton.<br> - Excuse me, Sister.<br> I'm Walter Delacroix's father.<br> - Mr. Delacroix, I'm sorry about--<br> - Sister, I'm a Catholic.<br> How can you sit by Poncelet's side<br> without ever having come to visit...<br> ...with me and my wife<br> or the Percys to hear our side?<br> How can you spend all your time<br> worrying about Poncelet...<br> ...and not think that maybe<br> we needed you too?<br> Mr. Delacroix, I didn't think<br> that you wanted to talk to me.<br> Earl, we're going in.<br> This is Mary Beth and Clyde Percy.<br> - I'm sorry about your daughter.<br> - Yeah, so are we. Excuse us.<br> Listen, Sister...<br> ...I'm sure you've seen a side of Matt<br> Poncelet that none of us has seen.<br> I'm sure he's on his best behavior,<br> must be pretty sympathetic to you.<br> But, Sister, this is an evil man.<br> This is a man who abducted<br> teenage kids and raped...<br> ...and killed them.<br> That scum robbed me of my only son.<br> My name...<br> My family name dies with me.<br> There will be no more Delacroixs,<br> Sister. No more.<br> I want you to know I do care<br> about you and your family...<br> ...and what happened to your son.<br> I'm gonna give you my number...<br> ...and if there's anything<br> that you need, you just call me.<br> Me call you?<br> Think about that, Sister.<br> Think about how arrogant that is.<br> Excuse me.<br> You all right?<br> We better be getting on in.<br> It is the finding of this board<br> that clemency...<br> ...be denied to Matthew Poncelet.<br> Execution will be carried out<br> as scheduled one week hence.<br> Don't give up hope, Matt.<br> We got a judge in the Federal Court<br> that can put a stop to this.<br> Beyond that there's the<br> Supreme Court and the governor.<br> I'll get a private meeting<br> with him if it's the last thing I do.<br> Looks like you're all I got.<br> I can have a spiritual adviser<br> of my choice. Will you do it?<br> Ride along into the sunset with me.<br> You'll have to spend several hours<br> with him every day as his death nears.<br> Then on the day of his execution,<br> you'll have to spend all day with him.<br> It's not an easy job.<br> Usually, it's done by a chaplain<br> or a priest or a Moslem cleric.<br> I want you to be realistic about this.<br> We've got about a one in one thousand<br> chance things might go our way.<br> It's a tough road.<br> If that had been a king,<br> you could go back over, right?<br> You can jump three this way<br> then go all the way back.<br> She got that big old bad joker and<br> won't put it down. That's a shame.<br> My turn. My turn.<br> I got an ace. I'm really lucky.<br> - Whose was this?<br> - Mine.<br> Don't kill him. He's a child of God.<br> He's reformed. He's a poet.<br> Blah, blah, blah.<br> Attention all ye folks, ye advocates<br> of killers and child molesters.<br> Ye opponents of execution.<br> Ye cannot walk upon the high ground.<br> Ye do not have the moral<br> authority to walk there.<br> Ye traverse with scum<br> and scum is where--<br> - What do you want?<br> - Forgive me for intruding...<br> ...but I haven't been able to get<br> you and your wife out of my mind.<br> I've been trying to call you,<br> but there's been no answer.<br> Can I please speak with you?<br> Sure.<br> I'm really sorry for not coming<br> to visit with you before this...<br> ...but I've never been involved<br> in anything like this before.<br> Truth is you're scared.<br> Yes.<br> I'd be too.<br> - Come in.<br> - Thank you.<br> Well, Sister...<br> ...can I ask you a question?<br> - Are you a communist?<br> - Communist? No.<br> I didn't think so.<br> That's what people around here say...<br> ...with you defending this murderer,<br> but I didn't think so.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Care for some coffee?<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm sorry about the mess.<br> My wife and I had a big fight.<br> We got back from the pardon board<br> hearing.<br> She took Walter's clothes out of his<br> closet, put them in boxes...<br> ...called Goodwill.<br> She says she wants<br> to put the past behind her.<br> She says she has<br> to move on in her life.<br> She's not herself.<br> That must be so hard.<br> When it first happened,<br> she had me bring her...<br> ...to Walter's grave every morning.<br> She wept a river, poor woman.<br> Whole days, nights, for weeks, months.<br> I wish there was some way...<br> ...some key into the past<br> to change it.<br> It tears me up.<br> She used to be a ball.<br> We would have us some fun.<br> Some times.<br> Laugh.<br> Laugh our heads off.<br> Walter learned to walk<br> on this floor right here.<br> He busted his chin on the arm<br> of that sofa right there.<br> And that love seat right there...<br> ...he sat with Hope...<br> ...a week before they died.<br> When you lose a child...<br> ...all the memories get sealed<br> in a place.<br> Sealed...<br> ...like a shrine.<br> So you've put in a request...<br> ...to be the spiritual adviser<br> to Matthew Poncelet.<br> - Yes, Father.<br> - Why?<br> He asked me.<br> - This is highly unusual.<br> - Why?<br> - You'd be the first woman to do it.<br> - Really?<br> This kind of situation requires<br> an experienced hand.<br> This boy is to be executed in six days<br> and is in dire need of redemption.<br> Are you up to this?<br> I don't know, Father. I hope so.<br> I've been praying for guidance.<br> You can save this boy...<br> ...by getting him to receive<br> the sacraments before he dies.<br> This is your job.<br> Nothing more, nothing less.<br> If you need any help,<br> please feel free to call on me.<br> Thank you, Father.<br> I don't want to be buried here.<br> They're gonna call my mama,<br> ask about the funeral arrangements.<br> Could you do it?<br> My mama'd fall apart.<br> I'll do it.<br> Do you ever read the Bible?<br> I ain't much of a Bible reader,<br> but I pick it up from time to time.<br> - Like W.C. Fields read his Bible.<br> - Who?<br> W.C. Fields. He used to play<br> this drunken character in the movies.<br> He's dying and a friend comes<br> and sees him reading the Bible.<br> The friend says,<br> "W.C., you don't believe in God.<br> Why are you reading the Bible?"<br> And Fields says,<br> "I'm looking for a loophole."<br> I ain't looking for no loophole.<br> Rain, rain, rain.<br> That's a bad sign. They already<br> executed one black, Tobias.<br> Wayne Purcell tonight.<br> That's two blacks.<br> Time for a white.<br> The governor's under pressure<br> to get a white. And that's me!<br> Nigger on the gurney before me.<br> I hope they clean it before me.<br> - Was your daddy a racist?<br> - What kind of question is that?<br> - I wonder who taught you to hate.<br> - I don't like niggers.<br> Have you known any blacks?<br> - They was all around--<br> - All around?<br> Lived around me.<br> - Did you ever play with a black child?<br> - No.<br> - Me and my cousin got jumped once.<br> - What happened?<br> We was throwing rocks at them.<br> The next day, they tear our bikes up.<br> - Can you blame them?<br> - No. But, look, slavery's long over.<br> They're harping<br> on the bad deal they got.<br> - The kids?<br> - All of them.<br> I hate people who make<br> themselves out as victims.<br> - Victims?<br> - Yeah, they all victims.<br> I don't know any victims.<br> I know some cool people, hard- working.<br> I know a lot of lazy, welfare-taking<br> coloreds sucking up tax dollars.<br> - You sound like a politician.<br> - What's that mean?<br> - Ever been the object of prejudice?<br> - No.<br> What do people think<br> about inmates on death row?<br> - Why don't you tell me?<br> - They're monsters.<br> Disposable waste, good-for-nothings<br> sucking up tax dollars.<br> I ain't no victim. I'm innocent.<br> I ain't whining. I ain't sitting<br> on a porch going "slavery, slavery."<br> I like rebels, some blacks.<br> Martin Luther King led people<br> to D.C., kicked the white man's butt.<br> - You respect Martin Luther King.<br> - He put up a fight, wasn't lazy.<br> - Lazy whites?<br> - Don't like them.<br> - So it's lazy people you don't like.<br> - Can we talk about something else?<br> Jesus also said, "He who lives<br> by the sword shall die by the sword."<br> Purcell had it coming!<br> He had it coming!<br> Nine, eight, seven...<br> ...six, five, four...<br> ...three, two, one.<br> It's the only way we can be sure<br> that they will not kill again.<br> Life without parole? Oh, sure.<br> How many prison guards do they have<br> to kill before it's over?<br> These people are mad dogs. Maniacs.<br> Come on. Let's go.<br> If the governor<br> and the courts turn us down...<br> ...Matt's gonna be dead in six days.<br> We gotta get us a funeral home<br> and someplace to bury him.<br> Maybe our sisters will donate<br> one of their burial plots.<br> Somebody to do the burial service.<br> Clothes.<br> I guess a suit.<br> Suit?<br> What size suit do you think he wears?<br> I don't know.<br> How tall is he?<br> I don't know.<br> I think he's kind of big.<br> What size is kind of big?<br> Does it run like big,<br> medium and petite?<br> Well, I don't know. I never bought<br> a man's suit before.<br> Won't you be a pretty sight?<br> A nun shopping for a man's suit.<br> I'm out of my league.<br> This is so surreal.<br> Hope had just graduated<br> from high school in early May.<br> She was to join the Air Force<br> on June 15th.<br> That's the day it happened.<br> She almost got out of Slidell.<br> She was hoping<br> to get stationed overseas.<br> She liked to travel...<br> ...and loved being around people<br> of different cultures.<br> On June 15th, a recruiting sergeant<br> was to meet Hope in Slidell...<br> ...and drive her to Baton Rouge<br> for induction.<br> The day before, I took her shopping<br> for things she'd need...<br> ...you know, just practical things.<br> That evening at 5:00 she dressed...<br> ...and went to work<br> at Corey's where she waitressed.<br> After work, she had a date<br> with Walter.<br> She was about to leave...<br> The hem of her skirt was coming out.<br> She was in such a hurry.<br> I pinned it for her with one<br> of those tiny safety pins.<br> She was gone out the door.<br> You don't know when you see<br> your child leave...<br> ... that you're never gonna<br> see them alive again.<br> If I'd known that...<br> ...I would have told her<br> how much I love her.<br> You know, my last words to her...<br> ...the last that she ever heard<br> from me...<br> ...were about the hem of her skirt.<br> Next morning we waited<br> for her to come out.<br> This was Hope's big day.<br> Our baby was leaving home.<br> Her room was empty...<br> ...and the bed was still neatly made.<br> So I telephoned the Delacroixs and...<br> Our hearts sank<br> when the Delacroixs told us...<br> ...that Walter hadn't come home<br> that night too.<br> And then for one brief moment<br> we thought...<br> ...maybe they'd run off<br> and gotten married.<br> But we knew that she was just too<br> sensible to do something like that.<br> I went down to the police and<br> filled out a missing person's form.<br> Three days later the sheriff<br> formed a search party.<br> I went along with them.<br> They were gone all day.<br> They walked for miles and nothing.<br> On Thursday, June 20th...<br> ...some kids were out<br> near Flank's Cove...<br> ...and they found a purse<br> and some clothing and a wallet.<br> They turned them in to the police.<br> They found the kids' bodies<br> on Friday...<br> ...six days after they'd gone missing.<br> My daughter's body was nude...<br> ...legs spread-eagle.<br> Coroner's report said<br> that her vagina was all tore up.<br> At first they couldn't find<br> this class pin she was wearing...<br> ...because it was embedded so deep,<br> from the stabbing.<br> She loved that pin.<br> She was so proud of it,<br> and she wore it all the time.<br> It said, "Class of '88<br> making a difference."<br> The police wouldn't let us go down<br> to the morgue and identify the body.<br> They said it would be too traumatic.<br> But I just couldn't...<br> ...bear the thought<br> of them burying that body...<br> ...without making absolutely and<br> positively sure that that was Hope.<br> I called my brother, he's a dentist.<br> I asked him to go<br> to the funeral home...<br> ...and make an I.D. from dental records.<br> Before he'd stuck his hand<br> into that bag...<br> ...with all that lime in it<br> and fished Hope's jaw out...<br> ...he'd been against<br> the death penalty.<br> And after that, he was all for it.<br> I knew it had to be Hope.<br> That's what my mind told me, you know,<br> but I just, I had to be sure.<br> - This is Sister Helen Prejean.<br> - Hello.<br> - Nice to meet you, Emily.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Let's go in the kitchen.<br> I'll make us some coffee.<br> I met Poncelet face to face<br> in the hallway during the trial.<br> I ain't gonna get no chair, Daddy.<br> You're gonna fry,<br> and I'm gonna watch you sizzle.<br> There was a sheriff standing<br> pretty close by me.<br> I could have grabbed his gun and shot<br> Poncelet right then and there.<br> I could've killed him on that day,<br> and I wished I would have.<br> I'd be a happier man today.<br> So, what made you change your mind?<br> Change my mind?<br> What made you come around to our side?<br> I wanted to come and see if I could<br> help y'all and pray with you.<br> Thank you.<br> But he asked me to be his spiritual<br> adviser, to be with him when he dies.<br> And what did you say?<br> That I would.<br> We thought you'd changed your mind.<br> We thought that's why you were here.<br> No.<br> - How can you come here?<br> - How can you do that?<br> How can you sit with that scum?<br> Mr. Percy, I've never done<br> this before.<br> I'm trying...<br> I'm trying to follow<br> the example of Jesus...<br> ...who said that every person<br> is worth...<br> ...more than their worst act.<br> This is not a person.<br> This is an animal.<br> No, I take that back. Animals don't<br> rape and murder their own kind!<br> Matthew Poncelet is God's mistake.<br> And you want to hold<br> the poor murderer's hand?<br> You want to comfort him when he dies?<br> There wasn't anybody in the woods<br> to comfort Hope...<br> ...when those two animals pushed<br> her face into the grass!<br> I just want to help him take<br> responsibility for what he did.<br> Does he admit to what he did?<br> Is he sorry?<br> He says he didn't kill anybody.<br> You're in waters way over your head.<br> You don't know what<br> it's like to carry a child...<br> ...and give birth and get up with a<br> sick child in the middle of the night.<br> You pray and get a good night's sleep.<br> My parents raised me<br> to respect the religious.<br> Sister, you need to leave<br> this house right now.<br> I'm--<br> Wait a minute!<br> If you really are sorry...<br> ...and do care about this family...<br> ...you'll want to see justice done<br> for our murdered child!<br> Now, you can't have it both ways!<br> You can't befriend that murderer<br> and expect to be our friend too.<br> You brought the enemy into this house,<br> Sister. You gotta go.<br> I come from a good family.<br> My family can't be blamed.<br> I had two families.<br> Both of them I'd love and die for.<br> - Your other family is...?<br> - The family of man. Of men in prison.<br> My white family,<br> the Aryan Brotherhood.<br> You're a white supremacist?<br> A follower of Hitler?<br> He was a leader. I admire him<br> for getting things done.<br> Like Castro, he got things done.<br> Hitler might have gone overboard<br> on the killing...<br> ...but he was on the right track.<br> The right track?<br> The murder of 6 million Jews?<br> What am I doing with this guy?<br> I must be nuts.<br> - Hello?<br> - Sister? It's Hilton Barber.<br> We need you<br> for a strategy meeting.<br> "In an interview with the Times...<br> ...Poncelet says that<br> if he had to do it again...<br> ...he'd do something useful<br> like join a terrorist group...<br> ...and bomb government buildings."<br> We must get him off<br> this political prisoner kick.<br> Henry, how close are we<br> on the Supreme Court docket?<br> - In a couple of days.<br> - We don't have a couple of days!<br> - We don't have the legal staff.<br> - You had it for three days.<br> - Where were you yesterday?<br> - I had to take my kid to the dentist.<br> A man is gonna die on death row and--<br> Yeah, well, my kid needed<br> to hold her daddy's hand.<br> If you don't like it, find another<br> lawyer to volunteer his time.<br> People reading these interviews<br> think you're a nut.<br> Admiring Hitler, wanting to come back<br> as a terrorist and blow people up?<br> I said government buildings,<br> not people.<br> Bombing a building won't hurt people?<br> I ain't got no love<br> for the government is all.<br> You're a fool. You are making it<br> so easy for them to kill you.<br> Coming across as some crazed animal...<br> ...Nazi, racist mad dog<br> who deserves to die.<br> - Is that what you think?<br> - You're making it so hard to help you.<br> You can leave.<br> I'm not gonna do that.<br> It's up to you.<br> You want me to go, you say so.<br> - Do you ever think about those kids?<br> - It's terrible what happened.<br> Especially since it didn't<br> have to happen.<br> Do you ever think about what<br> you did to their parents' lives?<br> It's hard to have sympathy for them...<br> - ...when they're trying to kill me.<br> - Think about it.<br> Their kids are shot, stabbed, raped...<br> ...left in the woods to die alone.<br> How'd you feel if somebody<br> did that to your family?<br> - What would you do to them?<br> - I'd sure as hell want to kill them.<br> I understand them, but they're<br> calling for the wrong head.<br> I want to take a lie detector test.<br> I know it won't change<br> them guys' minds...<br> ...but I want my mama to know<br> I didn't kill any kids.<br> The boy's good!<br> Go.<br> - Hey, y'all.

Did good. In heaven.<br> Praise Jesus.<br> There are some passages in there...<br> ...about when Jesus<br> was facing death alone...<br> ...that you might want to check out.<br> Me and Jesus have a different way<br> of doing things.<br> He's one of them<br> turn-the-other-cheek guys.<br> It takes a lot of strength<br> to turn the other cheek.<br> You say you like rebels.<br> What do you think Jesus was?<br> - He wasn't no rebel.<br> - Sure He was. He was a dangerous man.<br> - "Love your brother" is dangerous?<br> - Because His love changed things.<br> His love changed things.<br> The people nobody cared about: the<br> prostitutes, the beggars, the poor.<br> They finally had somebody<br> who respected them, loved them...<br> ...made them realize their own worth.<br> They had dignity and became powerful.<br> The guys on the top got real nervous.<br> So they had to kill Jesus.<br> Kind of like me, huh?<br> No, Matt, not--<br> Not at all like you.<br> He changed the world with His love.<br> You watched as two kids were murdered.<br> Step back from the door, Sister.<br> Why?

I think I just fainted.<br> - No, don't you move.<br> I'm hungry. I just need to eat.<br> I told Matt I'd be back.<br> Could you tell him what happened?<br> - When we're finished here.<br> - I've gotta tell him now.<br> I'll take care of it, Sister.<br> - Thank you.<br> - This isn't a heart attack.<br> I'm just hungry.<br> They don't let visitors eat here.<br> They must think we're some kind of<br> ferns that feed on air or something.<br> Is that the machine<br> that they use after an execution?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Just have to be official<br> about the whole thing.<br> Thank God we're off the chair.<br> It's a bit easier to take the needle.<br> Just part of the job.<br> Let's get some food in your stomach.<br> Who puts the needle in?<br> That's private information.<br> Is it you?<br> We cannot disclose any specifics<br> regarding execution procedure.<br> Let me get you a tray of food<br> and then we'll send you on home.<br> - I've gotta get back to Matt.<br> - I'm sorry, Sister.<br> This is warden's orders.<br> You're through for the day.<br> - Where'd you go?<br> - I couldn't come back.<br> - You all right?<br> - I'm fine.<br> I kept asking what happened.<br> I thought you had a heart attack.<br> - They said they'd tell you.<br> - They took me into that room.<br> - They was weighing me.<br> - What for?<br> To see how big a coffin I need.<br> Then I come back and you were gone.<br> I spent the whole day alone.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> - You ever get lonely?<br> - Yeah. Sure.<br> Sometimes when I smell the smoke<br> from the neighborhood barbecues...<br> ...and I hear all the kids laughing...<br> ...and I'm sitting in my room,<br> I feel like a fool.<br> What I miss most being here? Women.<br> You know, I used to sit at the bar,<br> just drinking and listening to music.<br> I'd dance till 3:00 in the morning.<br> I ain't gonna lie.<br> I believe in doing it.<br> My lady and I'd grab<br> a bottle, blanket, some weed...<br> ...go out in the woods,<br> and we'd do it.<br> It's something you miss, ma'am.<br> Let's face it, Matt.<br> If I had a family...<br> ...chances are I'd be with them now<br> instead of visiting with you.<br> True enough.<br> I'm glad you're here.<br> You want me to get a message<br> to your daughter?<br> Let her be.<br> Those things will kill you.<br> I won't let them break me.<br> I just pray God holds up my legs<br> on my last walk.<br> It's the wait.<br> It's the countdown that gets to you.<br> We'll know soon<br> about the federal appeal.<br> Hilton and I got an appointment<br> with the governor this evening.<br> Fat chance he'll do anything.<br> Risk his political butt for me?<br> I wish I hadn't said all that shit<br> about Hitler and being a terrorist.<br> Stupid!<br> Hartman says there won't be<br> any more media interviews.<br> Good. Keep my stupid mouth shut.<br> I was able to arrange a lie detector<br> test for tomorrow morning.<br> All right. There's some good news.<br> The man that's gonna give the test...<br> ...doubts they'll get<br> an accurate reading of the truth.<br> - Why?<br> - Tomorrow's the day of your execution.<br> You'll be stressed. The test<br> often mistakes stress for dishonesty.<br> No problem. I'm home free.<br> You been reading your Bible?<br> I tried to last night.<br> Makes me want to sleep.<br> I'm trying to stay conscious.<br> I appreciate you trying to save me...<br> ...but me and God,<br> we got our thing squared away.<br> Jesus died on the cross for us.<br> And I hold He'll take care of me when<br> I appear before God on Judgment Day.<br> Matt, redemption isn't some<br> kind of free admission ticket...<br> ...you get because<br> Jesus paid the price.<br> You gotta participate<br> in your own redemption.<br> You got some work to do.<br> I think maybe you should look<br> at John, chapter 8, where Jesus said:<br> "You shall know the truth...<br> ...and the truth shall make you free."<br> I'll check it out. I like that.<br> "The truth shall make you free."<br> I like that.<br> So I pass that lie detector test,<br> I'm home free.<br> If you do die...<br> ...I want to help you die<br> with dignity.<br> You can't do that...<br> ...unless you own up to the part you<br> played in Walter and Hope's death.<br> - Hilton Barber, Bishop Norwich.<br> - Hello.<br> Pleasure, Bishop.<br> Here's the situation.<br> Governor Benedict is a reluctant<br> supporter of capital punishment.<br> He has the power to stop<br> this execution and save a life.<br> It's the last vestige<br> of the divine right of kings.<br> The trick is, we have<br> to appeal to him...<br> ...on a personal level,<br> without any fanfare.<br> So I requested a private meeting.<br> You must understand. In representing<br> the State, I must carry out the laws...<br> ...and must submerge<br> my own personal views...<br> ...to carry out the will<br> of the people.<br> I'll look at this case.<br> But unless there's some clear,<br> striking evidence for innocence...<br> ...I will not interfere<br> with the process.<br> We still got the court, Sister.<br> We might hit pay dirt<br> on one of the legal issues.<br> Helen.<br> Helen, come to dinner.<br> You're looking for a love<br> that's so big, it takes in all evil.<br> Annunciations are common.<br> Incarnations are rare.<br> You're not a saint, Helen.<br> Helen. Helen.<br> Oh, Mama.<br> Are you okay?<br> Oh, yes. I was just dreaming.<br> What time do you have to be there?<br> Did you set a clock?<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, it's so bizarre.<br> A man's gonna be killed<br> in front of me tomorrow.<br> Has he admitted anything?<br> Oh, no.<br> He's so full of hate,<br> he doesn't trust anybody. He just--<br> He keeps pushing me away.<br> You're in deep water, kid.<br> Do you remember<br> when you gave me a black eye?<br> I had a fever.<br> You were delirious,<br> hysterical, screaming.<br> You were trying to get up<br> and run into the street.<br> You socked me in the eye<br> and you said you hated me.<br> You screamed, but I held you.<br> I held you tight.<br> Because a mother's arms are strong...<br> ...when her child's in danger.<br> I didn't sleep at all last night.<br> I didn't take that nerve medicine<br> they wanted to give me.<br> I'm looking death in the eyes.<br> I mean, I'm getting ready to go.<br> Listen, Matt, I want you to know<br> that I respect your need for privacy.<br> If you want to be alone or want<br> to be just with your family today...<br> ...I won't be offended.<br> Be there, if it won't put you out.<br> I want somebody to talk to<br> and be there to the end.<br> I'll be there.<br> If only I knew I'd die right away<br> with the first shot.<br> I mean, will I feel it?<br> The lungs go first. Like a...<br> ...fast choke.<br> That's gotta hurt.<br> They say that...<br> ...the body doesn't move.<br> Doesn't shake.<br> My poor mama.<br> Any word from the 5th Circuit?<br> None yet. But that's a good sign.<br> Maybe that means they see<br> something substantive in the petition.<br> - Gotta go. I'll call later.<br> - Thanks, Hilton.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Tell me something, Sister.<br> What is a nun doing<br> in a place like this?<br> Shouldn't you be teaching children?<br> And you know what this man has done.<br> How he killed them kids.<br> What he did was evil.<br> I don't condone it.<br> What's the sense in killing<br> to say killing is wrong?<br> You know how the Bible says,<br> "an eye for an eye"?<br> Know what else it asks for?<br> Death as a punishment<br> for adultery, prostitution...<br> ...homosexuality,<br> trespass upon sacred ground...<br> ...profaning the Sabbath<br> and contempt of parents.<br> I ain't gonna get in no Bible quoting<br> with no nun because I'm gonna lose.<br> She was only on the phone<br> a few minutes and there she was...<br> ...falling for the old Matt charm.<br> I had to take back that phone. You're<br> trying to steal my gal, you dog.<br> She sounds like a great little gal.<br> - She ain't so little, though.<br> - You shut up.<br> Take care of her, Craig.<br> Don't do nothing stupid.<br> She looks a little bit like...<br> Who was your girlfriend<br> in high school?<br> I had lots of girls in high school.<br> - No, the one with the funny name.<br> - Funny name?<br> Maddie, Maldy-- Maldy? Maldy.<br> - Madrigal.<br> - Madrigal.<br> Madrigal Parmelee. Oh, she was hot!<br> - She was a nasty little thing.<br> - Matthew!<br> Sorry, Ma. I mean, she was<br> a fine upstanding young woman.<br> How about you, Troy?<br> Got yourself a little girlfriend?<br> - No.<br> - Why not?<br> I ain't got time.<br> Too much fishing and camping to do.<br> - Troy just got a new tent.<br> - What kind of tents you got?<br> Army tent. Not them sissy ones<br> with all the colors.<br> - Tell Matt about the other night.<br> - He was camping in the yard.<br> Oh, I made him come in.<br> I was worried.<br> I went out and made him come inside.<br> - Mama, that ain't what happened.<br> - Go on.<br> - Go on. Tell him.<br> - Come on.<br> Me and my buddy Paul put up this tent,<br> cooked our own dinner.<br> We roasted potatoes in tin foil on<br> the fire and cooked us some weenies.<br> Then what? Go on.<br> - About midnight--<br> - No, about 9:00, I think. Yeah.<br> - We heard some kind of animal.<br> - What kind was that?<br> - It was big.<br> - Was it a bunny?<br> - Was it a possum?<br> - Shut up.<br> - Was it a squirrel?<br> - Was it a mouse?<br> Shut up! It was big and nasty.<br> Hey, look me in the eye, little man.<br> You go inside because Mama said so<br> or were you scared?<br> Now, tell the truth.<br> Look me in the eye.<br> We got him.<br> Some people are asking<br> about your funeral...<br> ...and I get real angry and I say,<br> "He's not dead yet."<br> Sorry, folks, we gotta wrap this up.<br> A little early, isn't it?<br> Rules say they can stay till 6:45.<br> It's time for you folks<br> to be leaving now.<br> - Here you go, Poncelet.<br> - Thanks, man.<br> My stuff's in these pillowcases.<br> Better if y'all took it home with you.<br> Don't want the prison sending it.<br> Craig, divide up all the stuff<br> except my boots from Marion.<br> I want to walk to my execution<br> in these here boots.<br> Up on your feet.<br> You all say your goodbyes now.<br> See you later, Matt.<br> - Bye.<br> - No goodbyes, little man.<br> - No, ma'am.<br> - Can't she hug him?<br> I'm sorry, Sister. Security reasons.<br> Don't cry, Mama.<br> I don't want to see no crying.<br> I'm not saying goodbye now.<br> - I'll call you tonight.<br> - See you, Matt. Stay strong.<br> Don't cry. I'll call you later.<br> We love you, Mattie.<br> If I'd put my arms around my boy,<br> I'd never have let go.<br> Is my mama all right?<br> She's fine, Matt.<br> All right. Goodbye.<br> I never had shrimp before.<br> They're pretty good.<br> So, what did he say? What's the word<br> on the lie detector test?<br> Culp said your answers<br> showed stress...<br> - ...and the results were inconclusive.<br> - Man.<br> Was the dude sure?<br> Absolutely, positively sure.<br> I felt all right answering them<br> questions. I didn't feel no stress.<br> I can't believe I failed.<br> Matt, you'd have to be a robot<br> or insane not to feel stress now.<br> I can't believe it didn't<br> come out right.<br> Let's talk about what happened.<br> Let's talk about that night.<br> I don't want to talk about that.<br> - Get out.<br> - You're pretty.<br> - Trespassing.<br> - What?<br> - You're trespassing.<br> - We'll leave.<br> - Let's go!<br> - You're under arrest. Step out.<br> We'll leave.

What,<br> is he just an innocent? A victim?<br> I ain't no victim.<br> Poncelet.<br> Federal Appeals Court turned you down.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Sister, please step into the corridor.<br> I'll be right outside.<br> I'm sorry, son.<br> I feel like I failed.<br> No, you didn't fail.

I couldn't.<br> I didn't have the guts<br> to stand up to him.<br> I told my mama I was yellow.<br> She kept saying, "It wasn't you, Matt.<br> It wasn't you, Matt. It wasn't you."<br> Your mama loves you, Matt.<br> That boy?<br> Walter?<br> Yeah?<br> What?<br> I killed him.<br> And Hope?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Did you rape her?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Do you take responsibility<br> for both of their deaths?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> When the lights dimmed last night<br> I kneeled and prayed for them kids.<br> I never done that before.<br> Oh, Matt.<br> There are spaces of sorrow<br> only God can touch.<br> You did a terrible thing, Matt,<br> a terrible thing.<br> But you have a dignity now.<br> Nobody can take that from you.<br> You are a son of God,<br> Matthew Poncelet.<br> Nobody ever called me<br> no son of God before.<br> Called me a son of you-know-what<br> lots of times, never no son of God.<br> I just hope my death<br> can give them parents some relief.<br> Maybe the best thing you can give...<br> ...to the Percys and the Delacroixs<br> is a wish for their peace.<br> You know I never had<br> no real love myself.<br> Never loved a woman<br> or anybody else myself much good.<br> Well, it figures I'd have<br> to die to find love.<br> Thank you for loving me.<br> Oh, the time. It's been flying.<br> I'm really cold.<br> Can he have a jacket or something?<br> He's cold.<br> What happened to that song<br> you were gonna play for me?<br> The hymn?<br> They have a rule you can't<br> have music in the prison.<br> Yeah, so they won't let me play it.<br> Well, you know the words.<br> You can sing it.<br> - I can't sing.<br> - That's okay. Come on.<br> Thank you.<br> I need you to step<br> into the corridor, Sister.<br> Give me my boots! I want my boots!<br> A grown man going to his death<br> in a diaper and slippers.<br> I'll be done with all of this!<br> No bars, no cells, no life in a cage!<br> Matt.<br> Sister Helen...<br> ...I'm gonna die.<br> You know truth.<br> The truth has made you free.<br> God knows the truth about me.<br> I'm going to a better place.<br> I'm not worried about nothing.<br> You all right?<br> Yes.
