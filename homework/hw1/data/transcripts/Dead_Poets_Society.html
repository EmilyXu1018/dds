They're probably<br> in their nineties or something.<br> Ooh!<br> Anything's better<br> than Hell-ton hash, Knox.<br> - [Charlie] I'll second that.<br> - [Knox] Yeah, we'll see.<br> - You coming to the study group tonight?<br> - [Others Chattering]<br> Uh... no. No, l...<br> Uh, I've got some history I wanna do.<br> - Suit yourself.<br> - [Laughing]<br> Ready, Overstreet?<br> Ready to go, sir.<br> - [Doorbell Ringing]<br> - [Woman] Chet, can you get that?<br> - [Chet] I can't, Mom.<br> - [Girl] I'll get it!<br> Can I help you?<br> Hi. Knox Overstreet.<br> - Uh, Dr Hager.<br> - [Girl] Hi.<br> This is the Danburrys',<br> right?<br> - Are you here to see Chet?<br> - Mrs Danburry?<br> - [Laughing] No.<br> - Sorry. Thank you.

How are you?<br> Joe Danburry.<br> - Nice to meet you, sir.<br> - He's the spitting image of his father.<br> - [Chuckling] How is he? Come on in.<br> - [Chet] Chris!<br> - Great. He just did a big case for G.M.<br> - I know where you're headed.<br> - [Chris] I'm coming.<br> - Like father, like son, huh?<br> [Boy]<br> Ooh! Psycho!<br> - Yes!<br> - To Queen-Six.<br> - Another game?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Duh!<br> Just replace these numbers here<br> with "x, "for "x' 'and "y. "<br> - Of course.<br> - Of course. So what's the problem?<br> [Boy] You think I can get in there?<br> You've been hogging it all day.<br> - Wait. No.<br> - How was dinner?<br> Huh?<br> - How was dinner?<br> - Terrible.<br> - Awful.<br> - Why?

It's a tragedy.<br> A girl this beautiful<br> in love with such a jerk.<br> All the good ones go for jerks.<br> You know that.<br> Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book<br> and try and figure out problem five.<br> I can't just forget her, Cameron.<br> And I certainly<br> can't think about trig.<br> - [Radio Humming]<br> - We got it!<br> All right, gentlemen.<br> Five minutes.<br> - [Radio Continues Humming]<br> - Let's go.<br> - Did you see her naked?

Science experiment.<br> Radar.<br> [Radio Continues Humming]<br> Gentlemen, open your text<br> to page 21 of the introduction.<br> Mr Perry, will you read<br> the opening paragraph of the preface,<br> entitled<br> "Understanding Poetry."<br> "'Understand Poetry'<br> by Dr J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D.<br> "To fully understand poetry,<br> we must first be fluent...<br> "with its metre, rhyme<br> and figures of speech.<br> "Then ask two questions.<br> "One: How artfully has the objective<br> of the poem been rendered?<br> "And, two: How important<br> is that objective?<br> "Question one rates<br> the poem's perfection.<br> "Question two rates<br> its importance.<br> "And once these questions<br> have been answered...<br> "determining a poem's greatness<br> becomes a relatively simple matter.<br> "If the poem's score<br> for perfection is plotted...<br> "on the horizontal<br> of a graph...<br> "and its importance<br> is plotted on the vertical,<br> "then calculating<br> the total area of the poem...<br> "yields the measure<br> of its greatness.<br> "A sonnet by Byron might<br> score high on the vertical,<br> "but only average<br> on the horizontal.<br> "A Shakespearean sonnet,<br> on the other hand,<br> "would score high both<br> horizontally and vertically,<br> "yielding<br> a massive total area;<br> "thereby revealing<br> the poem to be truly great.<br> "As you proceed through the poetry in<br> this book, practise this rating method.<br> "As your ability to evaluate<br> poems in this manner grows,<br> so will... so will your enjoyment<br> and understanding of poetry."<br> Excrement.<br> That's what I think<br> of Mr J. Evans Pritchard.<br> We're not laying pipe.<br> We're talking about poetry.<br> I mean, how can you describe poetry<br> like American Bandstand?<br> "I like Byron. I give him a 42.<br> But I can't dance to it."<br> Now, I want you<br> to rip out that page.<br> Go on.<br> Rip out the entire page.<br> You heard me.<br> Rip it out.<br> Rip it out!<br> Go on.<br> Rip it out.<br> Thank you, Mr Dalton.<br> Gentlemen, tell you what.<br> Don't just tear out that page.<br> Tear out the entire introduction.<br> I want it gone, history.

So you are.<br> Excuse me.<br> [Keating]<br> Keep ripping, gentlemen.<br> This is a battle, a war.<br> And the casualties could be<br> your hearts and souls.<br> Thank you, Mr Dalton.<br> Armies of academics<br> going forward measuring poetry.<br> No! We will not<br> have that here.<br> No more<br> of MrJ. Evans Pritchard.<br> Now, my class, you will learn<br> to think for yourselves again.<br> You will learn<br> to savour words and language.<br> No matter what<br> anybody tells you,<br> words and ideas<br> can change the world.<br> I see that look<br> in Mr Pitts' eye...<br> like 19th century literature<br> has nothing to do...<br> with going to business school<br> or medical school.<br> Right? Maybe.<br> Mr Hopkins, you may agree<br> with him, thinking,<br> "Yes, we should simply study<br> our Mr Pritchard...<br> "and learn our rhyme and metre<br> and go quietly about the business...<br> of achieving other ambitions."<br> I have a little secret for you.<br> Huddle up.<br> Huddle up!<br> We don't read and write<br> poetry because it's cute.<br> We read and write poetry because<br> we are members of the human race.<br> And the human race<br> is filled with passion.<br> Medicine, law,<br> business, engineering:<br> These are noble pursuits<br> and necessary to sustain life.<br> But poetry,<br> beauty, romance, love...<br> these are what<br> we stay alive for.<br> To quote from Whitman:<br> "O me, O life of the questions<br> of these recurring.<br> "Of the endless trains<br> of the faithless.<br> "Of cities filled<br> with the foolish.<br> "What good amid these,<br> O me, O life?<br> "Answer:<br> That you are here.<br> "That life exists<br> and identity.<br> "That the powerful play<br> goes on,<br> and you may contribute<br> a verse."<br> "That the powerful play<br> goes on,<br> and you may contribute<br> a verse.

Sure.<br> - Want some milk or sugar in that?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Gosh, they don't give you<br> much room around here.<br> It's part of the monastic oath.<br> They don't want worldly things<br> distracting me from my teaching.<br> - She's pretty.<br> - She's also in London.<br> - [Laughs]<br> - Makes it a little difficult.<br> - How do you stand it?<br> - Stand what?<br> You can go anywhere. You can do<br> anything. How can you stand being here?<br> Because I love teaching.<br> I don't want to be anywhere else.<br> - What's up?<br> - I just talked to my father.<br> He's making me quit the play<br> at Henley Hall.<br> But acting is everything to me.<br> I mean...<br> But he doesn't know. He...<br> I can see his point. We're not<br> a rich family like Charlie's. I mean...<br> But he's planning the rest<br> of my life for me.<br> And he-he's never asked me<br> what I want.<br> Have you ever told your father<br> what you just told me?<br> About your passion for acting?<br> Have you showed him that?<br> - I can't.<br> - Why not?<br> I can't talk to him this way.<br> Then you're acting for him too.<br> You're playing the part<br> of the dutiful son.<br> I know this sounds impossible,<br> but you have to talk to him.<br> You have to show him<br> who you are, what your heart is.<br> I know what he'll say.<br> He'll tell me that acting's a whim<br> and I should forget it.<br> [Sniffling]<br> They're counting on me.<br> He'll just tell me to put it<br> out of my mind for my own good.<br> You are not<br> an indentured servant.<br> It's not a whim for you. You prove it to<br> him by your conviction and your passion.<br> You show him that,<br> and if he still doesn't believe you...<br> Well, by then, you'll be out of school,<br> and you can do anything you want.<br> No.<br> [Sniffling]<br> What about the play?<br> The show's tomorrow night.<br> Then you have to talk<br> to him before tomorrow night.<br> L...<br> [Sighs]<br> - Isn't there an easier way?<br> - No.<br> [Chuckles]<br> I'm trapped.<br> No, you're not.<br> [All Chattering]<br> [Chattering Continues]<br> Chris!<br> Chris!

Chris...<br> Knox, what are you doing here?<br> I came to apologize for the other night.<br> I brought you these<br> and a poem I wrote for you.<br> Knox, don't you know that<br> if Chet finds you here, he'll kill you?<br> - I don't care. I love you, Chris.<br> - Knox, you're crazy.<br> Look, I acted like a jerk,<br> and I know it.<br> - Please accept these. Please.<br> - No. No, l-I can't.<br> Just forget it.<br> [Bell Rings]<br> [Door Opens, Closes]<br> [All Chattering]<br> - Knox, I don't believe this.<br> - All I'm asking you to do is listen.<br> [Knox Reading]<br> "The heavens made a girl named Chris...<br> "with hair and skin of gold.<br> - [Chattering Stops]<br> - [Knox] "To touch her...<br> - [Boy Snickers]<br> - [Sighs]<br> - Would be paradise.

What'd she say?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What do you mean, nothing?<br> Nothing.<br> But I did it.<br> [Charlie] Well, what did she say?<br> She had to say something!<br> - [Pitts] Hey, Knox!<br> - [Knox Whooping] Seize the day!<br> - Did you talk to your father?<br> - Uh, yeah.<br> He didn't like it one bit, but at least<br> he's letting me stay in the play.<br> He won't be able to m-make it.<br> He's in Chicago.<br> But, uh, I think he's gonna<br> let me stay with acting.<br> Really? You told him<br> what you told me?<br> Yeah.<br> [Chuckles]<br> He wasn't happy.<br> But he'll be gone<br> at least four days.<br> I don't think he'll make<br> the show, but...<br> I think he'll let me<br> stay with it.<br> "Keep up the schoolwork."<br> [Chuckles]<br> Thanks.<br> [Gathers Books, Exits]<br> - Oh, baby.<br> - Beautiful baby.<br> - I am...<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Just a moment. Yes. You're so good.<br> - [Laughing]<br> Come on, Todd.<br> I'm trying to fix this.<br> Come on, Nuwanda,<br> we're going to miss Neil's entrance.<br> He said something about<br> getting red before we left.<br> - "Getting red"? What does that mean?<br> - L... You know Charlie.<br> [Meeks] So, Charlie,<br> what's this "getting red"bit?<br> - Ooh. [Laughs]<br> - Ooh. [Laughs]<br> [Laughing]<br> W-What is that?<br> It's an Indian warrior<br> symbol for virility.<br> Makes me feel potent,<br> like I can drive girls crazy.<br> [Knox] Oh, come on, Charlie.<br> The girls are waiting.<br> [Boys Chattering, Whistling]<br> Whoa.<br> [Whistling]<br> [Wolf Whistle]<br> Chris.<br> What are you doing here?<br> - [Keating] Gentlemen, let's go!<br> - Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up.<br> Yeah. Come on, guys.<br> [Knox]<br> Chris, you can't be in here.<br> - If they catch you, we're both<br> gonna be in big trouble.<br> - Come on.<br> - Oh, but it's fine if...<br> - Shh, shh. Chris.<br> It's fine for you to come barging into<br> my school and make a fool out of me?<br> I didn't mean<br> to make a fool out of you.<br> Well, you did.<br> Chet found out.<br> It took everything I could do to keep<br> him from coming here and killing you.<br> - Knox, you have got to stop this stuff.<br> - I can't, Chris. I love you.<br> Knox, you say that over and over.<br> You don't...<br> You don't even know me.<br> [Keating]<br> Will you bejoining us, Mr Overstreet?<br> - [Knox] Go ahead, Captain.

Knox,<br> i-it just so happens...<br> that I could care less<br> about you.<br> Then you wouldn't be here<br> warning me about Chet.<br> I have to go.<br> I'm gonna be late for the play.<br> - Are you going with him?<br> - [Laughs] Chet? To a play?<br> - Are you kidding?<br> - Then come with me.<br> Knox, you are so infuriating!<br> Come on, Chris,<br> just give me one chance.<br> If you don't like me after tonight,<br> I'll stay away forever.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> - I promise. Dead Poets honour.<br> You come with me tonight,<br> and then if you don't want to see me<br> again, I swear I'll bow out.<br> - What would happen if Chet found out?<br> - He won't know anything.<br> We'll sit in the back<br> and sneak away as soon as it's over.<br> And I suppose you would promise<br> that this would be the end of it?<br> - Dead Poets honour.<br> - What is that?<br> - My word.<br> - Hmm.<br> You are so infuriating.<br> [Laughing]<br> [Whispering] Hey, there he is!<br> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<br> [Keating]<br> Shh, boys.<br> Either I mistake your shape<br> and making quite...<br> or else you are that shrewd and<br> knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow!<br> Thou speak'st aright.<br> I am that merry wanderer<br> of the night.<br> I jest to Oberon<br> and make him smile...<br> when I a fat and bean-fed<br> horse beguile.
