                        Boy, oh boy, oh boy.<br> Willy?<br> It's all right.<br> I came back.<br> Why, what happened?<br> Did something happen, Willy?<br> - Nothing happened.<br> - You didn't smash the car?<br> I said nothing happened!<br> - Didn't you hear me?<br> - Don't you feel well?<br> I'm tired to the death.<br> I, uh, I couldn't make it.<br> I just couldn't make it, Linda.<br> Where were you all day?<br> You look terrible.<br> Oh, I got as far<br> as a little above Yonkers.<br> I stopped for a cup of coffee.<br> - Maybe it was the coffee.<br> - What?<br> I suddenly couldn't drive anymore.<br> The car kept going off<br> onto the shoulder.<br> Maybe it's the steering.<br> I don't think<br> Angelo knows the Studebaker.<br> No, it's me. Suddenly I realise<br> I'm going 60 miles an hour<br> and I don't remember<br> the last five minutes.<br> I can't seem to keep my mind to it.<br> Maybe it's your glasses.<br> You never went for new glasses.<br> I see everything.<br> I came back ten miles an hour.<br> It took me nearly four hours<br> from Yonkers.<br> You just gotta take a rest.<br> You can't continue like this.<br> Aw, I just got back from Florida.<br> But you didn't rest your mind.<br> Your mind is overactive<br> and the mind is what counts, dear.<br> I'll start out in the morning.<br> Maybe I'll feel better in the morning.<br> Oh, these... these arch supports<br> are killing me.<br> Take an aspirin.<br> Should I get you an aspirin?<br> Lt'll soothe you.<br> I was driving along, understand?<br> I was fine.<br> I was even observing the scenery.<br> You can imagine me looking at scenery<br> on the road every week of my life.<br> But it's so beautiful up there, Linda.<br> The trees are thick and the sun is warm.<br> I just open the windshield<br> and let the warm air bathe over me.<br> And then all of a sudden I'm...<br> ...l'm going off the road.<br> I'm telling you,<br> I absolutely forgot I was driving.<br> If I'd have gone the other way<br> over the white line<br> I might have killed somebody.<br> So, I went on again and five minutes<br> later I'm dreaming again and I nearly...<br> I have such thoughts.<br> I have such strange thoughts.<br> Talk to them again, Willy.<br> There's no reason<br> why you can't work in New York.<br> I'm the New England man.<br> I'm vital in New England.<br> You're 60 years old. They can't expect<br> you to keep driving every week.<br> I'll have to send a wire to Portland.<br> I'm supposed to see Brown and Morrison<br> tomorrow morning to show the line.<br> - Oh, I could sell them.<br> - Now, Willy.<br> Go down to that place again.<br> Talk to Howard.<br> Tell him you gotta work in New York.<br> You're too accommodating.<br> If old man Wagner was alive,<br> I'd have been in charge of New York now.<br> That man was a prince.<br> He was a masterful man.<br> That boy of his, Howard,<br> he don't appreciate.<br> When I went north the first time,<br> the Wagner Company didn't know<br> where New England was.<br> Why don't you<br> tell these things to Howard?<br> Oh, I will. I definitely will.<br> - Oh, is there any cheese?<br> - I'll make you a sandwich.<br> Go to sleep. I'll take some milk.<br> Geez.<br> Maybe he smashed up the car again.<br> He's gonna get his licence taken away<br> if he keeps that up.<br> I'm getting nervous about him, you know.<br> - His eyes are gone.<br> - No, I've driven with him.<br> He sees all right.<br> Just, he doesn't keep his mind on it.<br> I drove into the city<br> with him last week.<br> He stops at a green light.<br> It turns red and he goes.<br> - Maybe he's colour blind.<br> - Pop?<br> He's got the finest eye for colour<br> in the business.<br> - The boys in?<br> - They're sleeping.<br> - Happy took Biff on a date tonight.<br> - Is that so?<br> It was so thrilling,<br> seeing them shaving together,<br> one behind the other in the bathroom<br> and going out together.<br> - Did you notice?<br> - Hm?<br> The whole house smells<br> of shaving lotion.<br> Figure it out.<br> Work a lifetime to pay off a house.<br> You finally own it.<br> There's nobody to live in it.<br> Life's a casting off.<br> It's always that way.<br> No, no, some people<br> accomplish something.<br> Did Biff say anything<br> after I went this morning?<br> You shouldn't have criticised him,<br> after he just got off the train.<br> - You must not lose your temper at him.<br> - When did I lose my temper?<br> I simply asked him<br> if he was making any money.<br> - Is that criticism?<br> - Willy, how could he make any money?<br> There's such an undercurrent in him.<br> He became a moody man. Did he apologise<br> when I left this morning?<br> He was crestfallen, Willy.<br> Now, you know how he admires you.<br> I think when he finds himself you'll<br> both be happier and you won't fight.<br> How can he find himself on a farm?<br> Is that a life?<br> A farmhand in the beginning<br> when he was young,<br> I thought, a young man, it's good<br> for him to travel, take differentjobs.<br> It's more than ten years and<br> he has yet to make 35 dollars a week.<br> He is finding himself, Willy.<br> Not finding yourself at the age of 34<br> is a disgrace.<br> - Shh!<br> - The trouble is, he's lazy!<br> - Willy, please, they are sleeping.<br> - Biff is a lazy...<br> ...bum!<br> - Go down!<br> Get yourself something to eat<br> and be quiet.<br> Why did he come home?<br> I would like to know<br> what brought him home.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I think he's still lost, Willy.<br> I think he's very lost.<br> Biff Loman is lost<br> in the greatest country in the world.<br> A young man with such<br> personal attractiveness gets lost?<br> And such a hard worker.<br> There's one thing about Biff.<br> He's not lazy.<br> Never.<br> I'll see him in the morning, have<br> a talk with him, get him a job selling.<br> He'd be big in no time.<br> Remember the way they used to<br> follow him around in high school?<br> Oh, when he just smiled at them<br> their faces lit up.<br> When he walked down the<br> street with a crowd of kids behind him.<br> Will you ever forget that?<br> - You smoking?<br> - You want one?<br> I can never sleep when I smell it.<br> It's funny, Biff, you know... us.<br> Sleeping in here again, huh?<br> The old beds.<br> All the talk that went across<br> those two beds, huh?<br> - Our whole lives.<br> - Yeah.<br> A lotta dreams and plans.<br> About 500 women would like to know<br> what was said in this room.<br> - Remember that big Betsy something?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> What the hell was her name?<br> Over on Bushwick Avenue.<br> - With the collie dog.<br> - Yeah, that's the one.<br> - I got you in there, man.<br> - That was my first time, I think.<br> Boy, there was a pig.<br> You taught me everything I know<br> about women. Don't forget that.<br> I bet you forgot how bashful<br> you used to be, especially with girls.<br> Oh, I still am, Biff.<br> I just control it, that's all.<br> I think I got less bashful.<br> You got more so.<br> What happened, Biff?<br> Where's your old humour?<br> The old confidence?<br> What's the matter?<br> - Why does Dad mock me all the time?<br> - He's not mocking you, Biff.<br> Everything I say there's mockery<br> on his face. I can't get near him.<br> I think the fact<br> that you're not settled,<br> that you're still up in the air.<br> I think there's other things<br> depressing him.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Never mind. Don't lay it all to me.<br> But I think if you just got started...<br> I mean, is there any future<br> for you out there?<br> I don't know what the future is.<br> I don't know what I'm supposed to want.<br> What do you mean?<br> I spent six or seven years after<br> high school trying to work myself up.<br> Shipping clerk, salesman,<br> business of one kind or another.<br> It's a measly manner of existence.<br> To get on that subway<br> in the hot mornings in the summer,<br> to devote your whole life<br> to keeping stock or making phone calls.<br> And the selling, the buying.<br> To suffer 50 weeks of the year<br> for the sake of a two week vacation,<br> when all you really desire<br> is to be outdoors with your shirt off.<br> And always to have to get ahead<br> of the next fellow.<br> Still, that's how you build a future.<br> I bought a new kind<br> of American type cheese. It's whipped.<br> Why do you get American?<br> I like Swiss.<br> - I thought you'd like a change.<br> - I don't want a change.<br> - Why am I always being contradicted?<br> - I wanted it to be a surprise.<br> - Why don't you open a window in here?<br> - They're all open.<br> They boxed us in here.<br> Bricks and windows, windows and bricks.<br> We should have bought<br> the land next door.<br> There's not a breath of fresh air<br> in the neighbourhood.<br> The grass don't grow anymore.<br> You can't raise a carrot.<br> They should have had a law<br> against apartment houses.<br> Remember those two beautiful elm trees?<br> When I and Biff<br> hung the swing between them, huh?<br> Like being a million miles<br> from the city.<br> They should have arrested the builder<br> for cutting those down.<br> They massacred the neighbourhood.<br> More and more I think of those days,<br> Linda, this time of year.<br> It was lilacs and wisteria<br> and then the peonies<br> would come out... daffodils.<br> What fragrance in this room.<br> - People had to move somewhere.<br> - There's more people now.<br> - I don't think...<br> - There's more people!<br> That's what's ruining this country!<br> Population is getting out of control!<br> The competition is maddening!<br> Smell the stink from that apartment<br> house and another on the other side!<br> How can they whip cheese?<br> Go down, try it and be quiet.<br> You're not worried about me,<br> are you, sweetheart, huh?<br> No, you've got too much on the ball<br> to be worried about, my darling.<br> You're my foundation<br> and my support, Linda.<br> Oh, just try to relax.<br> You make mountains out of molehills.<br> I won't fight with him anymore.<br> If he wants to go to Texas, let him go.<br> - He'll find his way.<br> - Sure.<br> Certain men just don't get started<br> till later in life.<br> Like Thomas Edison, I think,<br> or B.F. Goodrich.<br> One of them was deaf.<br> I'll put my money on Biff.<br> And Willy, if it's warm Sunday<br> we'll drive in the country.<br> We'll open the windshield,<br> we'll take lunch.<br> The windshields don't open<br> on the new cars.<br> - But you opened it today.<br> - Me?<br> I didn't.<br> Now, isn't that peculiar?<br> - Isn't that remarkable?<br> - What, dear?<br> That is the most remarkable thing.<br> What, darling?<br> I was thinking of the Chevy.<br> Isn't that funny?<br> I could have sworn<br> I was back in that Chevy today.<br> That's nothing.<br> Something must have reminded you.<br> Remarkable.<br> Remember those days, huh?<br> The way Biff used to simonise that car?<br> Dealer refused to believe<br> there was 80,000 miles on it.<br> Close your eyes.<br> I'll be right up.<br> Now, you be careful on the stairs.<br> - The cheese is on the middle shelf.<br> - Eighty thousand mi...<br> Eighty-two thousand.<br> No, I've always made a point<br> of not wasting my life.<br> Whenever I come back here I know that<br> all I've done is to waste my life.<br> You're a poet, Biff.<br> You know that?<br> - You're an idealist.<br> - No, I'm mixed up very bad.<br> Maybe I ought to get married, right?<br> Maybe I ought<br> to get stuck into something.<br> Maybe that's my trouble.<br> I'm like a boy.<br> I'm not married, I'm not in business.<br> I'm just like a boy.<br> Are you content, Hap?<br> You're a success, aren't you?<br> Are you content?<br> - Hell, no.<br> - Why not? You're making money.<br> All I can do now is wait for<br> the merchandise manager to die.<br> Listen, kid, why don't you<br> come out West with me?<br> And you and I?<br> Maybe we can buy a ranch,<br> raise cattle, use some muscles.<br> Men built like we are<br> should be working in the open.<br> - The Loman brothers?<br> - We'd be known all over.<br> Biff, Biff, that's<br> what I dream of sometimes.<br> Sometimes I want to rip my clothes off<br> and outbox the merchandise manager.<br> I can outbox, out lift,<br> outrun anybody in the store<br> and I have to take orders<br> from those sons of bitches.<br> If you were with me I'd be happier.<br> Everybody around me is so false<br> that I am constantly lowering my ideals.<br> Together we'd stand up for one another.<br> We werert brought up to grub for money.<br> I don't know how.<br> - Neither can I.<br> - Let's go.<br> The only thing is,<br> what can you make out there?<br> Hap!<br> I got to show some<br> of those pompous executives there<br> that Hap Loman can make the grade, huh?<br> Then I'll go with you, Biff.<br> We'll be together yet.<br> I swear, huh?<br> But take those two we had tonight.<br> Werert they gorgeous creatures?<br> Yeah, most gorgeous I've had in years.<br> I get that any time I want, Biff.<br> Whenever I feel disgusted.<br> The only trouble is,<br> it gets like bowling or something.<br> I just keep knocking them over.<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> - You still run around a lot?<br> - Nah.<br> I'd like to find a girl steady,<br> somebody with substance.<br> - Mm-hmm. That's what I long for.<br> - Go on.<br> - You'd never come home.<br> - I would.<br> Somebody with character, like Mom.<br> You're gonna call me a bastard<br> when I tell you this.<br> That girl Charlotte I was with,<br> engaged to be married.<br> - No kidding.<br> - Sure.<br> Guy's in line<br> for the vice-presidency of the store.<br> I don't know what gets into me.<br> Maybe I have an overdeveloped<br> sense of competition.<br> I went and ruined her.<br> Furthermore, I can't get rid of her.<br> He's the third executive<br> I've done that to.<br> Isn't that a crummy characteristic?<br> And to top it all,<br> I go to their weddings.<br> Don't get your sweater dirty!<br> Biff!<br> Doesrt he know Mom can hear that?<br> Oh, what a simonising job.

I'm trying.<br> - Are you home to stay now?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I'll look around.<br> - You can't look around all your life.<br> I just can't take hold.<br> I can't take hold to some kind of life.<br> Biff, a man is not a bird<br> to come and go with the springtime.<br> Your hair.<br> Your hair's getting so gray.<br> It's been gray<br> since you were in high school.<br> - I just stopped dying it.<br> - Well, dye it again, Mom.<br> I don't want my pal looking old.<br> You are such a boy!<br> You think you can go away for a year?<br> You've got to get it into your head now.<br> One day you'll knock on this door,<br> there will be strange people here.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You're not even 60 yet.<br> What about your father?<br> - Well, I meant him, too.<br> - He admires Pop.<br> If you don't have feeling for him,<br> you can't have feelings for me.<br> - Sure, I can.<br> - No, Biff.<br> You can'tjust come to see me!<br> Because I love him.<br> He's the dearest man in the world to me<br> and I won't have anyone making him feel<br> unwanted and low and blue.<br> You have got to make up your mind now.<br> There's no leeway anymore.<br> Either he's your father,<br> and you pay him that respect,<br> or else you're not to come here.<br> - Hey, Biffo!<br> - What the hell is the matter with him?<br> - Don't go near him.<br> - Stop making excuses for him.<br> He always wiped the floor with you.<br> He never had an ounce of respect.<br> - He always had respect for her.<br> - What do you know?<br> - Don't call him crazy.<br> - He's got no character.<br> Charley wouldn't do this,<br> not in his house.<br> - Peeling that vomit from his mind.<br> - Charley never had what he's got.<br> People are worse off than Willy Loman,<br> I've seen them.<br> Then make Charley your father.<br> You can't do that, can you?<br> I am not saying he's a great man.<br> Willy Loman never earned a lot of money.<br> His name was never in the paper.<br> He's not the finest character.<br> But he's a human being.<br> And a terrible thing is happening<br> to him. So attention must be paid.<br> He must not be allowed<br> to fall into his grave like an old dog.<br> Attention! Attention must<br> finally be paid to such a person.<br> - You called him crazy?<br> - Mom, I didn't...<br> Wait a minute. A lot of people think<br> he's lost his balance,<br> but you don't have to be very smart<br> to know what his trouble is.<br> - The man is exhausted.<br> - Sure.<br> A small man can be<br> just as exhausted as a great man.<br> He works for a company<br> he opens up uneard of territories<br> to their trademark,<br> and now, in his old age,<br> they take his salary away!<br> - I didn't know that, Mom.<br> - You never asked, my dear!<br> Now you get your spending money<br> somewhere else<br> - you don't trouble your mind with him.<br> - I gave you money.<br> Christmastime, 50 dollars.<br> To fix the hot water it cost $97.50!<br> For five weeks<br> he's been on straight commission,<br> like a beginner, an unknown.<br> Those ungrateful bastards!<br> Are they any worse than his sons?<br> He drives 700 miles,<br> and when he gets there no one<br> knows him anymore, no one welcomes him.<br> And what goes through a mars mind<br> driving 700 miles home<br> without having earned a cent?<br> Why shouldn't he talk to himself?<br> Why not, when<br> he has to go to Charley every week<br> and borrow 50 dollars from him,<br> and pretend to me it's his pay.<br> How long can that go on?<br> How long?<br> And you tell me he has no character?<br> The man who never worked a day<br> in his life but for your benefit!<br> And when does he get the medal for that?<br> Is this his reward?<br> To turn around at the age of 63<br> and find his sons,<br> who he loved better than his life,<br> - one a philandering bum...<br> - Mom!<br> That is all you are, my baby.<br> And you! What happened<br> to the love you had for him?<br> You were such pals.<br> How you used to talk every night<br> on the phone,<br> how lonely he was<br> till he could come home to you.<br> All right, Mom.<br> I'll live in my room, I'll get a job,<br> I'll just keep away from him.<br> No, Biff, you can't stay here<br> and fight all the time.<br> He threw me out of this house.<br> Why did he do that?<br> - Because I know he's a fake.<br> - A fake!<br> - In what way? What do you mean?<br> - Just don't lay it all at my feet.<br> It's between me and him.<br> That's all I have to say.<br> I'll chip in from now on.<br> He'll settle for half my paycheque.<br> - He'll be all right.<br> - He won't be all right!<br> I hate this city and I'll stay here.<br> Now, what do you want?<br> - He's dying, Biff.<br> - Why is he dying?<br> He's been trying to kill himself.<br> How?<br> Do you remember I wrote you that<br> he smashed the car again in February?<br> Well?<br> The insurance inspector came.<br> There's evidence that all the accidents<br> in the last year werert accidents.<br> How can they tell?<br> That's a lie.<br> - It seems there's a woman...<br> - What woman?<br> What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - What did you say?<br> - I said, "What woman?"<br> - What about her?<br> She was walking down the road.<br> She saw his car.<br> She said he wasrt driving fast at all.<br> He didn't skid, she said.<br> He came to that little bridge and<br> deliberately smashed into the railing.<br> It was the shallowness of the water<br> that saved him.<br> Mom, he probably just fell asleep again.<br> - No. I don't think he fell asleep.<br> - Why not?<br> Last month...<br> Oh, boys, it's so hard<br> to say a thing like this.<br> I was looking for a fuse, the lights<br> blew out, I went down in the cellar.<br> Behind the fuse box,<br> it happened to fall out,<br> was this length of rubber pipe,<br> just short.<br> No kidding.<br> There was an attachment<br> on the end of it.<br> I knew right away, and sure enough.<br> On the bottom of the hot water heater<br> there's a new nipple on the gas pipe.<br> - Thatjerk.<br> - Did you have it taken off?<br> I'm ashamed to.<br> How can I mention it to him?<br> Every day I go down<br> and I take away<br> that little rubber pipe.<br> But when he comes home<br> I put it back where it was.<br> How can I insult him that way?<br> It sounds so silly and old-fashioned,<br> but I tell you,<br> he's put his whole life into you.<br> And you've turned your backs on him.<br> Biff, his life is in your hands.<br> I feel like a damn fool.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> It's settled now.<br> I've been remiss, I know that.<br> But now I'll stay and I swear to you,<br> Mama, I'll apply myself.<br> It's just that, see,<br> I don't fit in business.<br> Not that I won't try.<br> I'll try and I'll make good.<br> The trouble was,<br> you never tried to please people.<br> It's like when you worked<br> for Bob Harrison.<br> He said you were tops.<br> Then you go and do some damn fool thing<br> like whistling songs in the elevator.<br> So what? I like to whistle.<br> You don't raise a guy<br> to a responsible job who whistles.<br> Don't argue about it.<br> You'd go for a swim<br> in the middle of the day.<br> You don't take off?<br> You run off sometimes, on a nice day.<br> - Sure, but I cover myself.<br> - Oh, boys.<br> I'll tell you something.<br> In the business world<br> some of them think you're crazy.<br> - Screw the business world.<br> - Right. Great. But cover yourself.<br> I don't care!<br> They've laughed at Dad for years.<br> You know why? Because we don't belong<br> in this nuthouse of a city.<br> We should be mixing cement somewhere<br> on some open plain, or carpenters.<br> A carpenter's allowed to whistle.<br> Even your grandfather was better<br> than a carpenter.<br> You never grew up.<br> Bernard does not whistle<br> in the elevator, I assure you.<br> - I bet you do.<br> - I never whistled in an elevator.<br> And who in the business world<br> thinks I'm crazy, hmm?<br> I didn't mean it like that.<br> Don't make a thing out of it.<br> Go back to the West.<br> Be a carpenter or a cowboy.<br> - Enjoy yourself.<br> - He was just saying things.<br> - I heard what he said.<br> - Come on.<br> They laugh at me, huh?<br> Go to Filene's, go to the Hub,<br> go to Slattery's, Boston<br> and call out the name Willy Loman.<br> - See what happens. Big shot. Big.<br> - All right, Pop.<br> All right.<br> Why do you always insult me?<br> Dad, I didn't say a word.<br> - Did I say a word?<br> - He didn't say anything, Willy.<br> No.<br> - All right, good night.<br> - Willy! He's decided...<br> If you get tired hanging around<br> tomorrow, paint the ceiling I put up.<br> I'm leaving early tomorrow.<br> He's gonna see Bill Oliver, Pop.<br> Oliver?<br> For what?<br> Well, he always said he'd stake me<br> and I'd like to go into business,<br> so maybe I'll take him up on it.<br> - Isn't that wonderful?<br> - What's wonderful about it?<br> There's 50 men in the city of New York<br> that would stake him.<br> - Sporting goods?<br> - I guess so.<br> - I know something about it.<br> - He knows something about it!<br> You know sporting goods<br> better than Spalding, for God's sake.<br> - How much is he giving you?<br> - I don't know. I haven't seen him yet.<br> - Then what are you talking about?<br> - All I said was I was gonna go see him.<br> - You're counting your chickens again.<br> - Jesus.<br> - Don't curse in this house.<br> - Since when did you get so clean?<br> Don't use that language to me.<br> I won't have it!<br> I got an idea, a feasible idea. Let's<br> talk this over. Let's talk sense.<br> When I was in Florida last time I thought<br> of a great idea to sell sporting goods.<br> It just came back to me.<br> We have a line, the Loman line.<br> - We put on a couple of exhibitions.<br> - That's an idea. - Wait!<br> We form two basketball teams,<br> two water polo teams.<br> We play each other.<br> It's a million dollars of publicity.<br> Two brothers, see?<br> The Loman brothers.<br> - We could sell sporting goods.<br> - That is a one million dollar idea.<br> Marvellous.<br> I'm in great shape<br> as far as that's concerned.<br> It wouldn't be like a business at all.<br> We'd be out playing ball again.<br> - That's what I was talking about.<br> - You won't get fed up. It'd be family.<br> Lick the world. You guys together could<br> absolutely lick the civilised world.<br> I'll see Oliver.<br> If we could work that out...<br> - I think everything is...<br> - Stop interrupting!<br> Don't wear a sports jacket and slacks.<br> A business suit<br> and talk as little as possible.<br> - And don't crack any jokes.<br> - Hey, he did like me.<br> - He always liked me.<br> - Oh, he loved you.<br> Will you stop!<br> Walk in very serious.<br> You're not applying for a boy's job.<br> Money is to pass.<br> Be quiet, fine and serious.<br> Everybody likes a kidder<br> but nobody lends them money.<br> - I'll try to get some myself.<br> - I see great things for you.<br> I think your troubles are over.<br> Start big, you'll end big. Ask for 15.<br> How much you gonna ask for?<br> - Gee, I don't...<br> - Don't say gee. Gee is a boy's word.<br> A man walking in for $15,000<br> does not say "gee".<br> - Ten would be top.<br> - Don't be so modest.<br> You always start it too low.<br> Walk in with a big laugh.<br> Start off with a couple of your<br> good stories to lighten things up.<br> It's not what you say<br> but how you say it,<br> because personality always wins the day.<br> - Oliver always thought...<br> - Will you let me talk!<br> Dad, stop yelling at her.<br> I was talking, wasrt I?<br> I just don't like you<br> yelling at her all the time.<br> - I'm telling you.<br> - You taking over this house?<br> - Willy, he didn't mean...<br> - Don't take his side all the time!<br> Stop yelling at her.<br> Give my best to Bill Oliver.<br> - He may remember me.<br> - Why did you have to start that?<br> Did you see how sweet he was<br> as soon as you talked hopefully?<br> Go up.<br> Say good night to him.<br> - Don't let him go to bed that way.<br> - Biff, let's buck him up.<br> Please, dear.<br> It takes so little to make him happy.<br> Come.<br> Your pyjamas are hanging<br> in the bathroom, Willy.<br> What a woman.<br> They broke the mould when they made her.<br> You know that, Biff?<br> He's off salary.<br> My god, working on commission.<br> Let's face it.<br> He's no hotshot selling man.<br> Sometimes you gotta admit<br> he's a sweet personality.<br> Lend me ten bucks.<br> I'm gonna buy some new ties.<br> I'll take you to a place I know.<br> Wear one of my striped shirts.<br> Mom got so gray.<br> She got awful old.<br> I'm gonna go in and see Oliver tomorrow<br> and I'm gonna knock him...<br> Come on up and tell Dad.<br> Let's give him a whirl.<br> With ten thousand bucks... boy.<br> That's the first time<br> I've heard the old confidence.<br> You're gonna live with me, kid,<br> and I'm telling you, any babe you want.<br> You say the word.<br> Can you do something about the shower?<br> It drips.<br> Oh, all of a sudden<br> everything falls to pieces.<br> That damn plumbing.<br> They ought to be sued, those people.<br> - Hardly finished putting it in...<br> - I'm wondering if Oliver will remember.<br> - You think he might? -Remember him?<br> What's the matter with you? Are you crazy?<br> If he'd have stayed with Oliver,<br> he'd be on top now.<br> Wait till Oliver gets a look at him. You<br> don't know the average calibre anymore.<br> The average young man today<br> has got a calibre of zero.<br> The greatest thing for him<br> was to bum up...<br> Willy.<br> - Glad to hear it, boy.<br> - He wanted to say good night to you.<br> Oh, yeah, you knock them dead, boy.<br> What do you want to tell me?<br> Take it easy, Pop, good night.<br> If anything falls off the desk<br> while you're talking to him,<br> like a package or something,<br> don't you pick it up.<br> - They have office boys.<br> - I'll make a big breakfast.<br> Will you let me finish, hmm?<br> Tell him you were in business<br> in the West, not farm work.<br> - All right, Dad. I will.<br> - I think everything's gonna be...<br> And don't undersell yourself.<br> No less than $15,000.<br> - OK. Good night, Mom.<br> - Because you got a greatness in you.<br> Biff!<br> Remember that.<br> - You got all kinds of greatness.<br> - Sleep well, darling.<br> - I'm gonna get married, Mom. I wanted<br> to tell you. - Go to sleep, dear.<br> I just wanted to tell you.<br> Keep up the good work.<br> Do you remember that Ebbets Field<br> game, the championship of the city?<br> Hmm?<br> Just rest, dear.<br> - Should I sing to you?<br> - Yeah, you sing to me.<br> You know, when that team came out,<br> he was the tallest.<br> You remember?<br> - All in gold.<br> - Oh, like a young god.<br> Hercules, something like that. And<br> the sun, the sun all around him.<br> Remember how he waved to me?<br> Right from the field, with the representatives<br> from three colleges standing by,<br> and the buyers I brought.<br> Oh, the cheers when he came out.<br> Loman! Loman!<br> Loman!<br> God Almighty, he'll be great yet.<br> A star like that, magnificent,<br> can never really fade away.<br> - Oh, boy.<br> - Willy?<br> Dear?<br> What has he got against you?<br> I'm so tired. Don't talk anymore.<br> Will you ask Howard<br> if he'll let you work in New York?<br> First thing in the morning.<br> Everything will be all right.<br> Gee.<br> Look at the moon<br> moving between the buildings.<br> Oh, oh, wonderful coffee!<br> - A meal in itself.<br> - Can I make you some eggs?<br> - Take a breath.<br> - You look so rested, dear.<br> I slept like a dead one.<br> First time in months.<br> Imagine sleeping till 10<br> on a Tuesday morning.<br> - Boys left nice and early? - They<br> were out of here by 8:00. - Good work.<br> It was thrilling, them leaving together.<br> I cannot get over the smell<br> of shaving lotion in this house.<br> Biff was very changed this morning.<br> His attitude seemed to be hopeful.<br> - He couldn't wait to see Oliver.<br> - He's heading for a change.<br> - Certain men take longer to get...<br> - Solidified.<br> - How did he dress?<br> - His blue suit.<br> He looked so handsome.<br> He could be anything in that suit.<br> Boy, there's no question.<br> No question at all.<br> Gee, on the way home tonight<br> I'd like to buy some seeds.<br> Wonderful, but not enough sun<br> gets back there. Nothing will grow.<br> Before it's over<br> we'll get a place in the country,<br> - I'll raise vegetables, chickens.<br> - You'll do it.<br> They'll get married and visit.<br> I'll build a guest house.<br> I've got so many tools. All I'd need<br> would be lumber and peace of mind.<br> - I sewed the liner.<br> - I could build two houses<br> - so they'd both come.<br> - Yes.<br> - He decide how much he's gonna ask for?<br> - He didn't, but I imagine ten.<br> Fifteen thousand.<br> You're gonna talk to Howard today?<br> Oh, yeah, I'll, uh...<br> I'll put it to him straight and simple.<br> - He'll have to take me off the road.<br> - Ask for a little advance.<br> We've got the insurance premium.<br> It's the grace period.<br> It's $108.68 because<br> we're a little short this month.<br> - Why are we short?<br> - You had the job done on the car.<br> - That damn Studebaker.<br> - One more payment on the refrigerator.<br> - Itjust broke again.<br> - It's old, dear.<br> We should have bought<br> a well advertised machine.<br> Charley bought a General Electric.<br> It's 20 years old and it's good.<br> - Willy, please! - Whoever heard<br> of a Hastings refrigerator?<br> Once in my life I'd like to buy<br> something outright before it's broken.<br> I am always in a race with the junkyard.<br> I just finished paying for the car.<br> It's on its last legs.<br> The refrigerator consumes belts.<br> - Willy.<br> - They time those things!<br> They time them so when you finally<br> pay for them they're used up.<br> All told, about 200 dollars<br> would carry us dear,<br> but that includes the last payment<br> on the mortgage.<br> When we've made that payment, Willy,<br> the house belongs to us.<br> - That's 25 years.<br> - Biff was nine when we bought it.<br> Well, that's a great thing,<br> to weather a 25 year mortgage.<br> It's an accomplishment.<br> All the cement, the lumber. The<br> reconstruction I put in this house.<br> There ain't a crack<br> to be found in it anymore.<br> - Well, it served its purpose.<br> - What purpose?<br> Some stranger will come along,<br> move in, and that's that.<br> If only Biff would take this house<br> and raise a family.<br> - Good-bye. I'm late.<br> - I forgot to tell you.<br> You're supposed to meet them for dinner.<br> Frank's Chop House, near Sixth Avenue.<br> Is that so? How about you?<br> Just the three of you.<br> They are gonna blow you to a big meal.<br> - Who thought of that?<br> - Biff came to me this morning.<br> He said, "Tell Dad we're gonna blow<br> him to a big meal. Be there 6:00".<br> You and your two boys<br> are gonna have dinner.<br> - Gee whiz, that's really something.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm gonna knock Howard for a loop, kid.<br> I'll get an advance<br> and I'll come home with a New York job!<br> - I'm gonna do it!<br> - That's the spirit, Willy!<br> I will never get behind the wheel<br> the rest of my life!<br> It's changing, Willy.<br> I can feel it changing.<br> - Beyond a question.<br> - Oh!<br> - You got your glasses?<br> - Yeah.<br> And your handkerchief?<br> And your saccharine?<br> - And my saccharine.<br> - Be careful on the subway stairs.<br> Will you stop mending stockings?<br> It gets me nervous. I can't tell you.<br> And don't forget,<br> Frank's Chop House.<br> - Maybe beets would grow out there.<br> - Oh, Willy, you tried so many times.<br> - Yeah, well, don't work hard.<br> - Now, you be careful.<br> Come on, give me a little something.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Psst.<br> - Hello, Willy.<br> - I'd like to talk to you, Howard.<br> - I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - What's that?<br> - Didrt you ever see one of these?<br> - It's a wire recorder.<br> - Can we talk a minute?<br> It records things.<br> I just got delivery yesterday.<br> It's the most terrific machine<br> I ever saw in my life.<br> - I was up all night with it.<br> - What do you do?<br> I bought it for dictation<br> but you can do anything with it.<br> Listen to this. I had it home.<br> Listen to what I picked up.<br> The first one is my daughter.<br> Get this.<br> Listen to that kid whistle.<br> That is lifelike, isn't it?<br> - Seven years old. Get that tone.<br> - I'd like to ask a little favour.<br> It's your turn now, Daddy.<br> She's crazy for me.<br> - That's me. - You're very<br> good. - Now this is my son.<br> The capital of Alabama is Montgomery.<br> The capital of California is Sacramento.<br> - Five years old.<br> He'll make an announcer someday.<br> - The capital of Colorado...<br> - That is alphabetical order.<br> - The maid kicked the plug.<br> - That certainly is...<br> Shh! For God's sake.<br> It is 9:00 so I have to go to sleep.<br> - It really is...<br> - Wait. The next is my wife.<br> - Talk!<br> - I can't think of anything.<br> - It's time.<br> - Hello. Howard, I can't talk.<br> - That was my wife.<br> - That is a wonderful machine. Can we...<br> I'm gonna take my camera and my bandsaw<br> and all my hobbies and out they go.<br> - This is the most fascinating<br> relaxation ever. - I think I'll get one.<br> They're a hundred and a half.<br> You can't do without it.<br> Supposing you want to hear Jack Benny,<br> see. But you can't be home at that hour.<br> You tell the maid to turn the radio on<br> when Jack Benny comes on,<br> and this automatically comes on<br> with the radio.<br> - When you come home...<br> - You come home any time you like.<br> You get yourself a Coke,<br> sit down, throw the switch,<br> and there is Jack Benny's programme,<br> in the middle of the night.<br> I'm gonna get one,<br> 'cause lots of times I'm on the road,<br> and I think, "What I must<br> be missing on the radio".<br> - Don't you have a radio in the car?<br> - Yeah. Whoever thinks of turning it on?<br> - Arent you supposed to be in Boston?<br> - That's what I want to talk about.<br> - You got a minute?<br> - What happened?<br> - You didn't crack up again, did you?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Oh!<br> Geez, you got me worried there<br> for a minute.<br> - Well, what's the trouble?<br> - Well, to tell you the truth,<br> I've come to the decision<br> that I'd rather not travel anymore.<br> - Not travel? Well, what would you do?<br> - Remember Christmastime at the party<br> you said you'd think<br> of a spot for me here in town?<br> - With us? - Sure. - Oh,<br> yeah, yeah, I remember.<br> I couldn't think of anything for you.<br> I'll tell you, Howard, the kids<br> are all grown up now, you know.<br> I don't need much anymore.<br> If I could take home $65 a week<br> I could swing it.<br> - Yeah, but Willy...<br> - I'll tell you why.<br> Speaking frankly<br> between the two of us, you know,<br> I'm just a little tired.<br> Oh.<br> I can understand that, Willy.<br> But you're a road man, Willy.<br> We're a road business.<br> We've got half a dozen salesmen here.<br> God knows, Howard,<br> I never asked a favour of any man,<br> but I was with the firm when<br> your father used to carry you in here.<br> - I know.<br> - Your father came to me<br> the day you were born and asked me<br> what I thought of the name Howard.<br> I appreciate that, Willy,<br> but there just is no spot here for you.<br> If I had a spot I would slam you<br> right in there, but I just don't.<br> - All I need is 50 dollars a week.<br> - Where am I gonna put you, kid?<br> It's not a question<br> of whether I can sell, huh?<br> No, but it's a business and<br> everybody's gotta pull his own weight.<br> - Let me tell you a story.<br> - Business is business.<br> This is definitely business.<br> Listen. You don't understand this.<br> When I was a boy, 18, 19,<br> I was already on the road.<br> There was a question in my mind<br> whether selling had a future for me.<br> In those days<br> I had a yearning to go to Alaska.<br> There were three gold strikes<br> in one month in Alaska.<br> I felt like going out,<br> just for the ride, you might say.<br> - You don't say?<br> - My father lived many years in Alaska.<br> He was an adventurous man.<br> We got quite a streak of self-reliance<br> in our family.<br> I thought I'd go out with<br> my older brother, try to locate him,<br> maybe settle in the North.<br> I was almost decided to go...<br> ...when I met a salesman<br> in the Parker House.<br> His name was Dave Singleman.<br> He was 84 years old and<br> he'd drummed merchandise in 31 states.<br> Old Dave would go up to his room,<br> put on his green velvet slippers,<br> pick up the phone and call the buyers.<br> Without ever leaving his room<br> at the age of 84,<br> he made his living.<br> When I saw that, I realised that selling<br> was the greatest career a man could want<br> because what could be more satisfying<br> than to be able to go at the age of 84<br> into 20 or 30 different cities<br> and pick up a phone<br> and be remembered and loved<br> and helped by many different people.<br> You know, when he died...<br> And by the way, he died<br> the death of a salesman,<br> in his green velvet slippers<br> in the smoker of the New York,<br> New Haven and Hartford<br> going into Boston.<br> When he died, hundreds of salesmen<br> and buyers were at his funeral.<br> Things were sad on a lot of trains<br> for months after that.<br> You see, in those days there was<br> personality in it, Howard.<br> There was respect and comradeship and...<br> ...and gratitude.<br> Today it's all cut and dry.<br> And there's no chance for bringing<br> friendship to bear or personality.<br> You see what I mean.<br> - They don't know me anymore.<br> - That's just the thing, Willy.<br> If I had 40 dollars a week,<br> that's all I need.<br> - I can't take blood from a stone.<br> - Howard!<br> The year Al Smith was nominated<br> your father came to me...<br> I'm talking about your father!<br> There were promises made<br> across this desk!<br> You mustnt tell me<br> that you got people to see!<br> I put 34 years into this firm,<br> Howard! Now I can't pay my insurance!<br> You can't eat the orange<br> and throw the peel away!<br> A man is not a piece of fruit!<br> Pay attention.<br> No, your father...<br> Howard...<br> In 1928 I had a big year.<br> I averaged 170 dollars a week.<br> - You never averaged 170 dollars a week.<br> - No, no, no!<br> I averaged 170 dollars a week<br> in the year 1928!<br> And your father came to me, Howard,<br> right across this desk,<br> put his hand on my shoulder...<br> You have to excuse me, Willy!<br> I have got to see some people.<br> Pull yourself together.<br> I'll be back in a little while.<br> Ah, pull myself together!<br> What did I say to him?<br> Oh, my god.<br> I was yelling at him.<br> Frank, Frank, don't you remember<br> what you told me that time?<br> You put your hand on my shoulder...<br> The capital of Delaware...<br> Oh, Howard!<br> Howard!<br> Howard, Howard, shut it off!<br> Shut it off!<br> - Look, Willy...<br> - I gotta get myself some coffee.<br> - I'll get coffee.<br> - Willy, look...<br> Look, Willy,<br> you can't go to Boston for us.<br> - Why can't I go?<br> - I don't want you to represent us.<br> I've been meaning to tell you<br> for a long time now.<br> - Howard, are you firing me?<br> - I think you need a good long rest.<br> When you feel better come back<br> and we'll try to work something out.<br> I gotta earn money, Howard.<br> Where are your sons?<br> Wort your sons give you a hand?<br> Oh, they're working on a very big deal.<br> This is no time for false pride.<br> Go to your sons<br> and tell them you're tired.<br> You got two great boys there.<br> - No question.<br> - That's that, huh?<br> In the meantime. All right.<br> I'll go to...<br> I'll go to Boston tomorrow.<br> No!<br> No.<br> I can't throw myself on my kids.<br> I'm not a freeloader.<br> - Kid, I am busy this morning.<br> - Let me go to Boston.<br> I have got a line<br> of people to see this morning.<br> - Sit down. Sit.<br> - What?<br> Oh.<br> Take five minutes<br> and pull yourself together.<br> And then go home, will you?<br> I need the office.<br> Whenever you can this week,<br> drop off the samples.<br> You'll feel better, Willy,<br> and then come back. We'll talk.<br> Pull yourself together, kid.<br> There's people outside.<br> Oh, Ben!<br> How did you do it, huh?<br> What's the answer?<br> Did you wind up the Alaska deal already?<br> Doesrt take much time if you know what<br> you're doing. I wanted to say good-bye.<br> - I gotta talk to you.<br> - I haven't the time.<br> Nothing's working out.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I bought timberland in Alaska. I need<br> a man to look after things for me.<br> God, timberland!<br> Me and my boys and those grand outdoors!<br> A new continent on your doorstep.<br> Get out of these cities. They're full of<br> talk, time payments and courts of law.<br> - You can fight for a fortune up there.<br> - Linda! Linda!<br> - Linda.<br> - You're back.<br> - I haven't much time.<br> - Wait.<br> He's got a proposition for me in Alaska.<br> - But you've got a job here.<br> - But in Alaska, kid, I could...<br> - You are doing well enough.<br> - Enough for what, dear?<br> Don't say things like that to him.<br> Enough to be happy right here, now.<br> Why must everyone conquer the world?<br> You're well-liked, the boys love you.<br> The other day old man Wagner told him<br> he'll be a member of the firm.<br> - Didn't he, Willy?<br> - I'm building something with this firm.<br> If a man is building<br> he must be on the right track.<br> - What are you building? Where is it?<br> - That's true, Linda, there's nothing.<br> Why, there's a man 84 years old, Willy.<br> That's right, Ben, that's right!<br> When I look at that man<br> I say what's there to worry about?<br> All he has to do is go into any city,<br> pick up a phone<br> and he's making his living. Know why?<br> - I gotta go.<br> - Oh, look at this boy.<br> Without a penny to his name, three<br> great universities are begging for him.<br> From there the sky's the limit! It's<br> not what you do, Ben, it's who you know!<br> And a smile on your face.<br> It's contacts, Ben, contacts!<br> The whole wealth of Alaska passing over<br> the lunch table of the Commodore Hotel.<br> And that's the wonder,<br> the wonder of this country,<br> that a man can end with diamonds<br> on the basis of being liked.<br> That's why, when you get<br> on that field today, it's important,<br> 'cause thousands of people<br> will be rooting for you, loving you.<br> When he walks into a business office,<br> his name will sound out like a bell,<br> and all the doors will open to him.<br> I seen it, Ben.<br> I seen it a thousand times. You can't<br> feel it in your hands, but it's there.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Don't you think I'm right?<br> - I value your advice.<br> - A new continent at your doorstep.<br> You could walk out rich.<br> Rich!<br> We're gonna do a hit, Ben, you hear me?<br> We're gonna do a hit!<br> Gee, I was afraid you left already.<br> - What time is it?<br> - Ten past one.<br> Oh, come on everybody,<br> Ebbets Field, next stop.<br> - Where's the pennants?<br> - Did you pack fresh underwear?<br> - I want to go. - I'm<br> carrying your helmet. - I am.<br> You promised me.<br> How am I gonna get in the locker room?<br> Let him carry the shoulder guards.<br> Can I? I told everybody<br> I was gonna be in the locker room.<br> - It's the Clubhouse.<br> - I meant the Clubhouse.<br> - Let him carry the shoulder guards.<br> - Stay close to us.<br> - Wave when Biff comes out on the<br> field! You set, boy? - Ready to go, Pop.<br> - Every muscle is ready.<br> - You realise what this means.<br> You're coming home this afternoon<br> captain of the All-Scholastic<br> Championship - of the city of New York.<br> - That's right, Pop, and remember,<br> when I take off my helmet,<br> that touchdowrs for you.<br> Let's go over.<br> I got no room for you, Charley.<br> - Room for what?<br> - In the car.<br> Going for a ride?<br> I want to shoot some casino.<br> Don't you realise what today is?<br> Oh, he knows, Willy.<br> He's just kidding you.<br> That's nothing to kid about. I'm<br> not kidding, Linda. What's going on?<br> He is playing at Ebbets Field today.<br> - Baseball in this weather?<br> - Don't talk to him. We're late.<br> - Didn't you hear the news?<br> - What?<br> Don't you listen to the radio?<br> Ebbets Field just blew up.<br> You go to hell! Everybody in?<br> Knock a homer, Biff.<br> Knock a homer!<br> I don't think that was funny, Charley.<br> Did you hear me, huh?<br> This is the greatest day in his life.<br> When are you gonna grow up?<br> When this game is over<br> you won't be laughing anymore.<br> They'll be calling him<br> another Red Grange, 25,000 a year.<br> - That so?<br> - Yeah!<br> - Wait a minute, Willy. I'm sorry.<br> - Yeah?<br> But tell me something.<br> Who is Red Grange?<br> Put up your hands.<br> Put up your hands, come on.<br> Put up your hands. Who do you think<br> you are, better than everybody?<br> Put up your hands! Put up your hands!<br> Put up your hands.<br> Who the hell do you think you are?<br> You don't know everything,<br> you big ignorant stupid...<br> Put up your hands.<br> What are you walking away for?<br> Don't walk away. You gonna say<br> something to me, say it to my face.<br> I know you laugh at me behind my back.<br> You'll be laughing out of the other<br> side of your face after this game.<br> The woods are burning.<br> Touchdown! Touchdown!<br> Eighty thousand people!<br> Right between the goal posts.<br> Touchdown! Touchdown!<br> Hello, baby! Touchdown!<br> Touchdown! Ah, Jenny.<br> Jenny, good to see you.<br> How are you?<br> - Working? Or still honest?<br> - Fine.<br> - How you been feeling?<br> - Not much any more.<br> - Oh!<br> - Hello, Uncle Willy.<br> Bernard.<br> - Look who's here.<br> - How are you?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - I just stopped by to see Pop.<br> To get off my feet till my train leaves.<br> I'm going to Washington.<br> - Is he in?<br> - He's with the accountant.<br> Sit down. What are you<br> gonna do in Washington?<br> - Just a case I've got there.<br> - That so? You gonna play tennis there?<br> I'm staying with a friend<br> who's got a court.<br> You don't say.<br> Their own tennis court?<br> - Those are fine people, I bet.<br> - They're very nice.<br> - Dad tells me Biff's in town.<br> - Yeah.<br> Biff's in. He's working<br> on a very big deal, Bernard.<br> - What's Biff doing? - He's been<br> doing very big things in the West,<br> but he decided<br> to establish himself here.<br> Very big. We're having dinner.<br> Did I hear your wife had a boy?<br> That's right. Our second.<br> Two boys.<br> - What do you know?<br> - You still with the old firm, Willy?<br> I'm overjoyed to see how<br> you made the grade, Bernard, overjoyed.<br> It's an encouraging thing to see.<br> A young man really... really...<br> Ah, it looks very good for Biff.<br> Very good.<br> - Bernard. - What is it, Willy?<br> - What... What's the secret?<br> - What secret?<br> - How did you...?<br> - Why didn't he ever catch on?<br> - Willy, I wouldn't know that.<br> Oh, you were his friend,<br> his boyhood friend.<br> It's something I don't understand.<br> His life ended<br> after that Ebbets Field game.<br> From the age of 17<br> nothing good ever happened to him.<br> - He never trained himself for anything.<br> - He took correspondence courses.<br> Radio mechanics, television...<br> He never made the slightest mark.<br> - Do you want to talk candidly?<br> - Bernard.<br> I regard you as a very brilliant man.<br> Bernard, I value your advice.<br> The hell with advice.<br> I couldn't advise you.<br> There's one thing<br> I have always wanted to ask you.<br> When he was supposed to graduate<br> and the teacher flunked him...<br> Ruined his life.<br> All he had to do was go<br> to summer school, make up that subject.<br> - That's right. That's right!<br> - Did you tell him not to go?<br> Me? I begged him to go.<br> I ordered him to go.<br> - Why wouldn't he go?<br> - Why? Why, Bernard!<br> That questiors been trailing me<br> like a ghost for 15 years.<br> He flunked the subject and he laid down<br> and died like a hammer hit him.<br> Let me talk to you, Bernard.<br> I got nobody to talk to.<br> It wasn't my fault. It keeps going<br> around in my head, maybe I did something.<br> I got nothing to give him.<br> Don't take it so hard.<br> Why did he lay down?<br> - What is the story there?<br> - Willy...<br> You're his friend. Come on.<br> Willy, I remember it was June.<br> Our grades came out. He'd flunked math.<br> That son of a bitch ruined his life.<br> Then Biff just got very angry and<br> he was ready to enrol in summer school.<br> - He was?<br> - He wasn't beaten by it at all.<br> But then, Willy, see...<br> What?<br> He disappeared from the block<br> for almost a month.<br> I got the idea that he'd gone<br> up to New England to see you.<br> Did he ever talk with you then?<br> - Willy?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> He came to Boston.<br> What about it?<br> Well, it's just<br> that when he came back...<br> I'll never forget this.<br> It always mystifies me<br> because I thought so well of Biff.<br> I loved him, Willy, you know.<br> He came back after that month<br> and took his sneakers.<br> Remember those sneakers with the<br> University of Virginia on them?<br> He was so proud of them.<br> Wore them every day.<br> He took them down into the cellar,<br> burned them up in the furnace.<br> We had a fistfight.<br> It lasted at least half an hour,<br> just the two of us,<br> punching each other down in the cellar,<br> crying right through it.<br> I often thought how strange it was<br> that I knew he'd given up his life.<br> What happened in Boston, Willy?<br> I just bring it up because you asked me.<br> What's that got to do with it?<br> - Don't get sore.<br> - What are you trying to do, blame me?<br> If a boy lays down is that my fault?<br> - Don't take it...<br> - Don't you talk to me that way.<br> What does that mean,<br> huh, what happened?<br> Hey!<br> - You're gonna miss that train.<br> - Yeah, I'm going.<br> Good-bye, Willy.<br> - Don't worry about it. If at first you<br> don't succeed... - Yes, I believe in that.<br> Sometimes, Willy, it's better for a man<br> just to walk away.<br> - Walk away?<br> - That's right.<br> What if you can't walk away?<br> I guess that's when it's tough.<br> Good-bye, Willy.<br> Good-bye, boy.<br> How do you like this kid?<br> Gonna argue a case in the Supreme Court.<br> - Pop!<br> - No.<br> - The Supreme Court?<br> - I gotta run.<br> - Bye, Dad.<br> - Knock 'em dead, Bernard.<br> The Supreme Court.<br> And he didn't even mention it?<br> He don't have to.<br> He's gonna do it.<br> And you never told him what to do.<br> You never took any interest in him.<br> My salvation is that I never<br> took any interest in anything.<br> Here's some money, 50 dollars.<br> I got an accountant inside.<br> Uh, Charley, look, uh...<br> I got my insurance to pay.<br> If you could manage it, I...<br> I need 110 dollars.<br> - I'd draw from my bank, but...<br> - Sit down, Willy.<br> I'm keeping an account of everything.<br> - Listen to me.<br> - I'll pay every penny back.<br> - I want you to know I appreciate...<br> - What's going on inside your head?<br> - Why? I'm simply...<br> - I offered you a job.<br> You can make 50 dollars a week<br> and I won't send you on the road.<br> - I got a job.<br> - Without pay?<br> What kind of a job is a job without pay?<br> Now, look, kid. Enough is enough.<br> I'm no genius, but I know<br> when I'm being insulted.<br> - Insulted?<br> - Why don't you want to work for me?<br> What does it matter with you?<br> I got a job.<br> What do you walk in here every week for?<br> Well, if... if you don't<br> want me to walk in here...<br> - I am offering you a job.<br> - I don't want your job.<br> When the hell are you gonna grow up?<br> You big ignoramus! If you say<br> that to me again I'll rap you one.<br> I don't care how big...<br> ...how big you are.<br> - How much do you need, Willy?<br> - Ah, Charley, I'm strapped.<br> I'm strapped. I don't know<br> what to do. I was just fired.<br> - Howard fired you?<br> - That's not no...<br> Imagine that. I named him Howard.<br> I named him! I named him Howard!<br> Willy, when are you gonna realise<br> that them things don't mean anything?<br> You named him Howard<br> but you can't sell that.<br> The only thing you got in this<br> world is what you can sell.<br> The funny thing is, you're a salesman<br> and you don't know that.<br> I always try to think otherwise,<br> I guess. I always felt...<br> ...if a man was impressive<br> and well-liked then nothing...<br> Why must everybody like you?<br> Who liked JP Morgan?<br> Was he impressive? In a Turkish bath<br> he looked like a butcher.<br> With his pockets on<br> he was very well-liked.<br> Now, listen, Willy,<br> I know you don't like me.<br> And nobody can say I'm in love with you.<br> But I'll give you a job<br> just for the hell of it.<br> - What do you say?<br> - No. No, I just...<br> No, I just can't work for you, Charley.<br> - What are you, jealous of me?<br> - No!<br> I can't work for you, that's all.<br> Don't ask me why.<br> You've been jealous of me<br> all your life, you damn fool.<br> Here.<br> - Pay your insurance.<br> - I'm keeping strict accounts.<br> I got some work to do. Take care<br> of yourself. And pay your insurance!<br> It's funny, after all the highways<br> and the trains and the appointments<br> and the years...<br> ...you end up worth<br> more dead than alive.<br> Willy, nobody's worth nothing dead.<br> You hear what I said?<br> Willy!<br> Oh, apologise to Bernard for me<br> when you see him.<br> I didn't mean to argue with him.<br> He's a fine boy.<br> They're all fine boys. And they'll<br> end up big, all of them someday.<br> They'll all play tennis together.<br> Wish me luck, Charley.<br> He saw Bill Oliver today.<br> Good luck.<br> Oh, Charley,<br> you're the only friend I got.<br> Isn't that a remarkable thing?<br> Jesus.<br> In the front<br> you're in the middle of noise.<br> Whenever you've got a party, Mr. Loman,<br> tell me, I'll put you back here.<br> You look French.<br> How's it coming, Stanley?<br> It's a dog's life. I only wish that<br> during the war they took me in the Army.<br> - I could have been dead.<br> - You got lobsters?<br> - A hundred percent big. - With the claws.<br> - Don't worry, I don't give you no mice.<br> How about some wine?<br> Put a hat on the meal.<br> No, the recipe I brought you from<br> overseas with the champagne in it<br> I still got that in the kitchen,<br> but it'll cost you a buck a piece.<br> - That's all right.<br> - You hit a number?<br> My brother, I think<br> he pulled off a deal today.<br> - I think we're going into business.<br> - That's the best, family business.<br> - That's the best.<br> - That's what I think.<br> What's the difference?<br> Somebody steals, it's in the family.<br> Shh. Strudel.<br> - Ma'am?<br> - I'm expecting someone.<br> Oh, look at that mouth. Oh, God,<br> and the binoculars. Wait on her.<br> - Would you like a menu?<br> - I'd like a...<br> Why don't you bring her...<br> Do you mind?<br> I sell champagne and I'd like her<br> to try my brand. Bring her a champagne.<br> - That's awfully nice of you.<br> - It's all company money.<br> That's a charming product<br> to be selling, isn't it?<br> Like everything else,<br> selling is selling.<br> - I suppose? - You don't happen<br> to sell? - No, I don't sell.<br> Would you object to a compliment?<br> You ought to be on a magazine cover.<br> - I have been. -W hat did I say before?<br> See, Stanley, she's a cover girl.<br> - Oh, I could see, I could see.<br> - What magazine?<br> A lot of them.<br> Thank you.<br> You know what they say in France?<br> Champagne is the drink<br> of the complexion.<br> - Hiya, Biffo.<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - No. No, no, I just got here.<br> Miss, um...? - Forsythe.<br> Miss Forsythe, this is my brother.<br> Is Dad here?<br> You might have heard of him.<br> He's a great football player.<br> - Really? What team?<br> - You're familiar with football?<br> - I'm afraid I'm not.<br> - Biff's with the New York Giants.<br> - Well, it is nice, isn't it?<br> - Good health.<br> - Happy to meet you.<br> - That's my name.<br> It's Harold, but at West Point<br> they called me Happy.<br> I see. How do you do?<br> - Isn't Dad coming?<br> - You want her?<br> - What? - You want her?<br> - I could never make that.<br> I remember the time that idea<br> would never come into your head.<br> - I just saw... - Wait, please. I've<br> got to see the old confidence.<br> If you want her she's on call.<br> I'm telling you, watch this.<br> Honey, are you busy?<br> Well, I am<br> but I could make a phone call.<br> Go and do that, will you, honey,<br> and see if you can get a friend.<br> We'll be here for awhile. Biff,<br> one of the greatest football players.<br> - I'm certainly happy to meet you.<br> - Come back soon.<br> - I'll try.<br> - Don't try, honey. Try hard.<br> Isn't that a shame?<br> Beautiful girl like that.<br> - That's why I can't get married.<br> - Hap, look...<br> - I told you she's on call.<br> - Cut it out.<br> I want to say something.<br> - Did you see Oliver?<br> - I saw him, all right.<br> I want to tell Dad a couple of things.<br> I want you to help.<br> - Is he gonna back you?<br> - Are you crazy?<br> You're out of your head,<br> do you know that?<br> Why, what happened?<br> I did a terrible thing today, Hap.<br> It's been the strangest day<br> I ever went through.<br> - I'm a little numb.<br> - What, he wouldn't see you?<br> I waited six hours for him, see.<br> All day I kept sending my name in.<br> Even tried to date his secretary<br> so she got me through. Not so.<br> You're not showing the confidence.<br> But he remembered you?<br> Finally at 5:00 he comes out,<br> didn't remember who I was or anything.<br> Biff, did you tell him my Florida idea?<br> Hap, he walked away.<br> I saw him and for one minute I got<br> so mad I could have torn the walls down.<br> How the hell did I ever get the idea<br> that I was a salesman there?<br> I believed myself<br> that I'd been a salesman for him.<br> Then he gave me one look and I realised<br> what a ridiculous lie my life's been.<br> We have been talking in a dream<br> for 15 years.<br> - I was a shipping clerk.<br> - What did you do?<br> Well, he... he left, see.<br> His secretary went out<br> and I was alone in the waiting room.<br> And next thing I know,<br> I was in his office.<br> Panel walls and everything.<br> I can't explain it, Hap.<br> I took his fountain pen.<br> Geez. Did he catch you?<br> I ran out. I ran down all 11 flights.<br> I ran and ran and ran.<br> Boy, that was dumb, Biff.<br> Why did you do that?<br> I don't know.<br> I just wanted to take something.<br> You gotta help me, Hap.<br> I want to tell Pop.<br> Are you crazy? What for?<br> He's gotta understand I'm not the man<br> somebody lends that kind of money to.<br> He thinks I've been spiting him<br> all these years.<br> Tell him something nice.<br> Say you got a date with Oliver tomorrow.<br> - What do I do tomorrow?<br> - Dad is never so happy<br> as when he's<br> looking forward to something.<br> Gee, I haven't been here in years!<br> - Sit down. You want a drink?<br> - Sure, I don't mind.<br> - You look worried.<br> - No.<br> Uh, Scotch all around.<br> Make it doubles.<br> You had a couple already, didn't you?<br> Did everything go all right?<br> - I had an experience today, Pop.<br> - That so? What happened?<br> I wanted to tell you everything<br> from first to last.<br> It's been a strange day.<br> I had to wait quite a while.<br> - Oliver?<br> - Yeah, Oliver.<br> All day, as a matter of cold fact.<br> And a lot of instances, Pop,<br> facts about my life came back to me.<br> Who was it, Pop, whoever said<br> I was a salesman with Oliver?<br> - Well, you were.<br> - No, I was a shipping clerk, Dad.<br> I don't know who said it first<br> but I was never a salesman for Oliver.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Hold onto the facts.<br> I was a shipping clerk.<br> - Listen to me...<br> - Dad, let me finish.<br> I'm not interested in stories<br> about the past.<br> The woods are burning, boys.<br> There's a big blaze going on all around.<br> I was fired today.<br> How could you be?<br> And I'm looking for a little good news<br> to tell your mother<br> - because the woman has suffered.<br> - Dad!<br> I haven't got a story left in my head<br> so don't give me a lecture about facts.<br> I am not interested.<br> Now, what have you got to say to me?<br> Did you see Oliver, huh?<br> - Geez, Dad.<br> - You didn't go up there?<br> - Sure, he went up there.<br> - I saw him. How could they fire you?<br> - What kind of welcome did he give you?<br> - He won't let you work on commission?<br> - I'm out! He gave you a warm welcome?<br> - Sure, Pop.<br> I was wondering if he'd remember you.<br> A man doesn't see him in ten years,<br> he gives him a welcome.<br> You know why he remembered?<br> - You impressed him in those days.<br> - Dad, can we talk and get this down?<br> What happened? Did he take you in<br> his office or talk in the waiting room?<br> - He came in...<br> - I bet he threw his arms around you.<br> - He's a fine man, a hard man to see.<br> - Oh, I know that.<br> - Is that where you had the drinks?<br> - Yeah.<br> - He told him my Florida idea.<br> - Don't interrupt.<br> - How'd he react to the Florida idea?<br> - Give me a minute to explain.<br> I've been waiting for you to explain<br> since I sat down here. What happened?<br> - I talked, he listened to me.<br> - Oh, the way he listens.<br> - What was his answer?<br> - An...

Will you let me out of it?<br> - Will you just let me out of it?<br> - What happened?<br> - I can't talk to him.<br> - Tell him.<br> - Shut up and leave me alone.<br> - No, no. You had to go and flunk math.<br> - Dad, what are you talking about?<br> - Math, math, math.<br> - Take it easy, Pop.<br> - If you hadrt of flunked you'd be set.<br> I'm gonna tell you what happened<br> and you're gonna listen to me.<br> I waited six hours and I kept sending<br> my name in but he wouldn't see me.<br> - Finally he came.<br> - Biff flunked mathl<br> - They won't graduate him.<br> - Where is he?<br> He ran off.<br> He went to Grand Central.<br> Is Uncle Willy in Boston?<br> See, so I'm washed up with Oliver,<br> Pop, do you understand that?<br> - Are you listening?<br> - If you hadrt have flunked...<br> - Dad, what are you talking about?<br> - I didn't flunk math. What pen?<br> - That was dumb, Biff.<br> - You took Oliver's pen.<br> - I just explained it.<br> - You stole Bill Oliver's fountain pen.<br> I didn't exactly steal it.<br> I was trying to tell you.<br> He had it in his hand,<br> Oliver walked in, he got nervous.<br> - My god, Biff.<br> - I never intended to do it...<br> - I'm not in my room. I'm not there.<br> - Ringing Mr Loman.<br> - Now, stop it.<br> - Mr Loman does not answer.<br> - I'm not there.<br> - Shall I page him?<br> - You're no good, no good for anything.<br> - I am, Dad.<br> I'll find something.<br> Don't worry about anything.<br> - Talk to me.<br> - Paging Mr Loman.<br> - No! No!<br> - He'll strike something, Pop, please.<br> - No!<br> - Dad, I'm telling you something good.<br> Oliver talked to his partner<br> about the Florida idea.<br> - You listening, Dad? Dad?<br> - Yeah.<br> He talked to his partner and he came<br> to me and I'm gonna be all right, Pop.<br> He said it's just a question<br> of the amount.<br> - Then you... Then you got it?<br> - It's gonna be terrific, Pop.<br> Aw, then you got it, haven't you?<br> - You got it, haven't you? You got it!<br> - No.<br> I'm supposed to have lunch<br> with him tomorrow.<br> I'm telling you so you'll know<br> I can make an impression.<br> I'll make good somewheres,<br> but I can't go tomorrow.<br> - Why not? You simply...<br> - The pen, Pop.<br> You give him the pen,<br> tell him it was an oversight.<br> - You have lunch.<br> - I can't.<br> You were doing a crossword puzzle,<br> you used his pen.<br> No, listen, kid,<br> I took those balls years ago, Pop,<br> and now I walk in with this fountain pen<br> that clinches it.<br> Don't you understand? I can't face him.<br> I'll try elsewhere.<br> - Don't you want to be anything?<br> - How can I go back?<br> Pop!<br> You don't want to be anything,<br> that what's behind it?<br> Don't take it that way! You think<br> it was easy walking into that office?<br> A team of horses couldn't<br> have dragged me to Oliver.<br> - Then why did you go?<br> - Why did I go?<br> Why did I go? Dad, look at you.<br> Look at what's become of you.<br> - You're gonna go to that lunch.<br> - I can't. I've got no appointment.<br> - Are you spiting me?<br> - Don't take it that way!<br> You rotten little louse.<br> Are you spiting me?<br> Dad.

Who goes off? Who runs away?<br> He doesn't mean anything to you.<br> You could help him, I can't.<br> Don't you understand what he's gonna do?<br> He's gonna kill himself.<br> - Don't you know that?<br> - Don't yell at me.<br> Hap, help him.<br> Help him!<br> Help me.<br> Help me!<br> I can't bear to look in his face.<br> Biff...<br> - Biff, where you going?<br> - What's he so mad about?<br> We're gonna catch up with him.<br> - I don't like that temper of his.<br> - He's overstrung.<br> - Do you want to tell your father?<br> - That's not my father, just a guy.<br> Come on, we're gonna catch up with Biff<br> and honey, we'll paint this town.<br> I love those bedroom eyes.<br> - That's how I knew you were friends.<br> - Mr Loman!

Stay in the bathroom<br> and don't come out.<br> There's a law in Massachusetts,<br> so don't come out.<br> It may be the new room clerk.<br> He looked mean. It's a mistake.<br> There's no fire.<br> - Dad. Why didn't you answer?<br> - Biff.<br> - What are you doing in Boston?<br> - Why didn't you answer?<br> I was knocking for five minutes.<br> I called you.<br> I just heard you.

He tried. I only got a 61.<br> They wouldn't give you four points?<br> Birnbaum refused absolutely.<br> I begged him to give me those points<br> but he won't listen.<br> You gotta talk to him.<br> Dad, before they close the school.<br> 'Cause if he saw the kind of man you are<br> and you talked to him in your way,<br> I'm sure he'd come through for me, Pop.<br> The class came right before practice,<br> so I didn't go enough.<br> Would you talk to him?<br> He'd like you, the way you can talk.<br> - I'm gonna drive right back.<br> - Dad, good work.<br> - I'm sure he'll change it.<br> - Tell the clerk I'm checking out.<br> Go right down.<br> The reason he hates me<br> is one day he was late for class,<br> so I got up at the blackboard<br> and imitated him.<br> - Crossed my eyes, talked with a lisp.<br> - You did?<br> - Yeah.<br> - The kids like it?<br> - They nearly died laughing.<br> - Yeah, what did you do?<br> The square root of 63 is...<br> In the middle of it he walks in.<br> He walked in!

I don't need it anymore.<br> Tell me, is there a seed store<br> in the neighbourhood?<br> Seeds?<br> - You mean, like to plant?<br> - Yes, like carrots, peas.<br> There's a hardware store<br> on Sixth Avenue.<br> - It may be too late now.<br> - I better hurry.<br> I gotta get some seeds.<br> Gotta get some seeds right away.<br> Well, what are you looking at?<br> Nothing is planted right.<br> I don't have a thing<br> in the ground right now.<br> "Carrots.<br> Quarter inch apart,<br> one foot rows..."<br> One foot.<br> Beets.<br> Lettuce.<br> One foot.<br> Oh, what a proposition.<br> Terrific, terrific,<br> 'cause she's suffered, man.<br> The woman has suffered.<br> A man can't go out the way he came in.<br> A man has got to add up to something.<br> You can't...<br> You can't. You gotta consider now.<br> Don't answer so quick.<br> Remember, it's a guaranteed<br> $20,000 proposition, huh?<br> Now, look, Ben, I want you to go through<br> the ins and outs of this thing with me.<br> I got nobody to talk to. And the<br> woman has suffered, you hear me?<br> - What's the proposition? - It's $20,000<br> on the barrel head, guaranteed.<br> Gilt edge, you understand?<br> You don't want<br> to make a fool of yourself.<br> - They might not honour the policy.<br> - How can they refuse? I worked.<br> I met every premium on the nose<br> and now they don't pay off? Impossible.<br> It's called a cowardly thing.<br> Why does it take more guts to stand here<br> the rest of my life ringing up a zero?<br> That's a point, William.<br> And 20,000. That is something<br> one can feel with their hands.<br> That's the whole beauty of it, Ben.<br> I see it like a diamond<br> shining in the dark<br> that I can pick up and touch in my hand.<br> Not like an appointment.<br> This would not be another appointment<br> and it changes all the aspects.<br> Because he thinks I'm nothing,<br> so he spites me.<br> But the funeral.<br> Oh, Ben, that funeral will be massive!<br> Oh, they'll come<br> from Maine, Massachusetts,<br> Vermont, New Hampshire.<br> All the old-timers<br> with the strange licence plates.<br> That boy will be thunderstruck, Ben,<br> because he never realised I am known.<br> Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,<br> I am known, Ben!<br> He'll see it with his eyes!<br> Once and for all,<br> he'll see what I am, oh!<br> He's in for a shock, that boy.<br> He'll call you a coward, William.<br> Oh, no, no, that would be terrible.<br> - Yes, and a damn fool.<br> - No, no!<br> He'll hate you, William.<br> He mustn't. Oh, I won't have that.<br> Mom, what are you doing up?<br> Where's Pop? Is he sleeping?<br> - Where were you?<br> - We met two girls, very fine types.<br> We brought you some flowers.<br> Put 'em in your room.<br> What did you do that for?<br> I want you to have flowers.<br> Don't you care whether he lives or dies?<br> - Biff, let's go up.<br> - Go away from me.<br> What do you mean, lives or dies?<br> Nobody's dying around here, pal.<br> Get out of here!<br> Get out of my sight!<br> I want to talk to the boss, Mom.<br> - You're not going near him.<br> - Where is he?<br> You invite him for dinner,<br> he looks forward to it all day.<br> - And then you desert him there?<br> - Dad?<br> There's no stranger you'd do that to.<br> He had a swell time with us.<br> When I desert him I hope I do it...<br> - Get out of here!<br> - Ma!<br> - Mom?<br> - Did you have to go to women tonight?<br> You and your rotten, lousy whores!<br> Mom, all we did was follow Biff around<br> trying to cheer him up.<br> - Boy, what a night you gave me.<br> - Get out of here.<br> Both of you, and don't come back.<br> I don't want you tormenting him anymore.<br> - Dad, are you down there?<br> - You can sleep in his apartment.<br> And pick up this stuff!<br> I'm not your maid anymore.<br> Go on, pick it up, you bum, you!<br> You're a pair of animals.<br> There's not one, not a living soul,<br> who would have the cruelty<br> to walk out on that man<br> in a restaurant.<br> - Is that what he said?<br> - He didn't have to say anything.<br> He was so humiliated,<br> he nearly limped when he came in.<br> - Look, Mom, he had a great time.<br> - Shut up!<br> You! Didn't even go to<br> see if he was all right.<br> No, Mom, I didn't. I didn't do<br> a damn thing. How do you like that?<br> I left him babbling in a toilet.<br> - You louse, you.<br> - You hit it on the nose.<br> The scum of the earth.<br> You're looking at him.<br> - Get out of here.<br> - I want to talk to the boss, Mom.<br> You're not going near him. Get out.<br> We're gonna have<br> an abrupt conversation, him and me.<br> You're not talking to him.<br> Please, leave him alone.<br> What is he doing out there?<br> He's planting the garden.<br> Now?<br> Oh, my god.<br> Never even let me carry<br> the valises in the house.<br> And simonising, simonising...<br> ...that little red car.<br> Why?<br> Why can't I give him something<br> and not have him hate me, huh?<br> Let me think about it.<br> I still have a little time.<br> A remarkable proposition.<br> Oh.<br> You gotta be sure<br> you're not making a fool of yourself.<br> Dad?<br> Where is that seed?<br> You can't see nothing here, boxed in.<br> Dad, there are people all around.<br> - Don't you realise?<br> - Don't bother me.<br> - I'm saying good-bye to you, Pop.<br> - Huh?<br> I'm not coming back anymore.<br> - You're not gonna see Oliver?<br> - Dad, I've got no appointment.<br> - He put his arm around you.<br> - Dad, get this now.<br> Every time I've left<br> it's been a fight that's sent me out.<br> Today I realise something about<br> myself. I tried to explain it to you.<br> I think I'm just not smart enough<br> to make sense out of it for you.<br> To hell with whose fault it is<br> or anything like that.<br> Let's just wrap it up.<br> - Come in and we'll tell Mom.<br> - I don't want to see her.<br> - Come on.<br> - I don't want to see her.<br> Don't bother me, will ya?<br> Dad, what do you mean?<br> You don't want to see her?<br> Pop, you don't want them<br> calling you yellow, do you?<br> Dad, it's not your fault.<br> It's me. I'm a bum.<br> Now, come on inside.<br> Dad, did you hear what I said to you?<br> Did you plant, dear?<br> All right, Mom.<br> We had it out.<br> I'm going and I'm not writing anymore.<br> I think it's best, Willy.<br> There's no use drawing it out.<br> You two will never get along.<br> If people ask where I am,<br> what I'm doing, you don't know or care.<br> That way it'll be off your mind<br> and you can start brightening up again.<br> All right?<br> That... That clears it, then, huh?<br> - You gonna wish me luck, scout?<br> - Shake his hand, Willy.<br> What do you say?<br> There's no necessity to mention...<br> He put his arm...!<br> Dad, you're never gonna see what I am,<br> so what's the use of arguing?<br> If I strike oil I'll send you a cheque.<br> Meantime, forget I'm alive.<br> Spite, see?<br> - Shake hands, Dad.<br> - Not my hand.<br> Dad?<br> - I was hoping not to go this way.<br> - This is the way you're going. Bye.<br> May you rot in hell<br> if you leave this house!<br> Exactly what is it<br> that you want from me?<br> I want you to know on the train,<br> in the mountains, in the valleys,<br> wherever you go,<br> that you cut down your life for spite!<br> - No, no!<br> - Spite!<br> When you are rotting somewhere<br> beside a railroad track, remember.<br> - Don't you blame it on me.<br> - I'm not blaming you.<br> I'm not taking the rap for this, hear?<br> - That's what I'm telling you.<br> - You're putting a knife in me.<br> Don't think I don't know<br> what you're doing.<br> All right, phoney.<br> Leave it there. Don't move it.<br> - What is that?<br> - You know damn well.<br> - I never saw that.<br> - You saw it, all right.<br> Mice didn't bring it into the cellar.<br> Is that supposed to make you a hero?<br> That supposed to make me sorry for you?<br> There will be no pity for you.<br> - Hear that? No pity.<br> - Hear the spite?<br> You're gonna get the truth,<br> what you are, what I am.<br> - Spite!<br> - Cut it out!<br> The man don't know who we are.<br> The man is gonna know.<br> We never told the truth<br> for ten minutes in this house.<br> - We always told truth.<br> - Are you the assistant buyer?<br> You're one of<br> the two assistants to the assistant.<br> - I'm practically...<br> - You are practically full of it.<br> - We all are. I'm through with it.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Hear this, Willy. This is me.<br> - I know you.<br> Do you know why I had no<br> address for three months?<br> I stole a suit in Kansas City<br> and I was in gaol.<br> - I suppose it's my fault.<br> - Stop crying, I'm through with it!<br> I stole myself<br> out of every good job since high school.<br> Whose fault is that?<br> I could never get anywhere<br> 'cause you blew me so full of hot air<br> that I could never stand<br> taking orders from anybody.<br> - I hear that.<br> - Stop it!<br> I had to be boss big shot<br> in two weeks and I'm through.<br> - Then hang yourself for spite!<br> - No! No!<br> No, nobody is hanging himself, Willy.<br> I ran down 11 flights with a pen<br> in my hand today.<br> And suddenly I stopped.<br> Do you hear me?<br> In the middle of that office building...<br> Do you hear this?<br> I stopped...<br> ...in the middle of the building<br> and I saw the sky!<br> And I... I... I saw the things<br> that I love in this world.<br> The work and the food<br> and the time to sit and smoke.<br> I looked at that pen in my hand and<br> I said, "What am I grabbing this for?<br> Why am I trying to become<br> what I don't want to be?<br> What am I doing in an office?<br> Making a contemptuous begging<br> fool of myself,<br> when all that I want<br> is out there waiting for me?"<br> The minute I say it, I know who I am.<br> Why can't I say that, Willy?<br> The door to your life is wide open!<br> Pop, I am a dime a dozen and so are you.<br> I am not a dime a dozen!<br> I am Willy Loman and you are Biff Loman!<br> I am not the leader of men, Willy!<br> And neither are you!<br> You were never anything<br> but a hard-working drummer<br> who landed in the ashcan<br> like all the rest of them.<br> I am one dollar an hour, Willy!<br> I am not bringing home<br> any prizes anymore,<br> and you're gonna stop waiting for me!<br> - You vengeful, spiteful mutt!<br> - Yeah, Pop!<br> Pop, I'm nothing.<br> I'm nothing, Pop.<br> Can't you understand that?<br> There's no spite in it anymore.<br> I'm just what I am, that's all.<br> What are you doing?<br> Aw, what are you doing?<br> - Why is he crying?<br> - Dad...<br> Will you let me go, for God's sake?<br> Will you take that phoney dream<br> and burn it before something happens?<br> I'll go in the morning.<br> Put him to bed.<br> Isn't that...<br> Isn't that remarkable?<br> Biff, he...<br> He likes me.<br> - He loves you, Willy.<br> - Always did, Pop.<br> Aw, Biff, he...<br> He cried. He cried to me.<br> Aw, that boy.<br> That boy, he's going to be magnificent.<br> Yes, outstanding,<br> with 20,000 behind him.<br> Come to bed, Willy.<br> It's all settled now.<br> Oh, yes, we'll sleep.<br> Come on, let's go to sleep.<br> It takes a great man<br> to crack thejungle.<br> I'm getting married.<br> Don't forget. I'm changing everything.<br> I'm gonna run that department<br> before the year is up.<br> Thejungle is dark<br> but full of diamonds.<br> Be good. You're both good boys.<br> Just act that way, that's all.<br> - Night, Pop.<br> - Night, boy.<br> - Come, dear. -S hh. One must<br> go in to fetch a diamond out.<br> I just want to get settled down<br> for a little while.<br> - I want you upstairs.<br> - A few minutes. I couldn't sleep now.<br> - Go. You look awful tired.<br> - Not like an appointment.<br> - A diamond is rough and hard to touch.<br> - I'll be right up.<br> - I think it's the only way.<br> - Sure, it's the best thing.<br> Best thing. The only way.<br> Everything is gonna be...<br> Aw, go on, kid. Get to bed.<br> - You look so tired. - Now, you<br> come right up. - Two minutes.<br> Loves me. Always loved me.<br> Isn't that a remarkable thing?<br> - Ben, he'll worship me for it.<br> - It's dark there.<br> But full of diamonds, Willy.<br> Can you imagine that magnificence<br> with $20,000 in his pocket?<br> Willy, come up.<br> Yes, yes, coming, coming!<br> It's very smart,<br> you realise, don't you, sweetheart?<br> Even Ben sees it.<br> I gotta go, baby.<br> Bye-bye.<br> When the mail comes<br> he'll be ahead of Bernard again.<br> - A perfect proposition all around.<br> - Did you see how he cried to me?<br> - Aw, I could kiss him, Ben.<br> - Time, William, time.<br> Ben, I always knew one way or another<br> we were gonna make it, Biff and I.<br> Boat! We'll be late.<br> Now, when you kick off,<br> I want a 70 yard boot.<br> And get right down the field<br> under the ball.<br> And when you hit,<br> hit low and hit hard,<br> because it's important, boy.<br> There's all kinds of<br> important people in the stands.<br> The first thing that you know...<br> Willy?<br> - Ben? Ben, where do I...?<br> - Willy?<br> - Ben! Ben!<br> - Willy!<br> Shh. Shh.<br> Shh! Shh!<br> - Willy, please come up.<br> - Oh.<br> - Willy!<br> - Shh!<br> Willy?<br> - Pop?<br> - Willy, answer me!<br> Willy!<br> - Willy!<br> - Pop! No!<br> - No!<br> - No!<br> It's getting dark, Linda.<br> How about it, Ma? Better get<br> some rest. They'll be closing the gates.<br> He had no right to do that.<br> There was no necessity.<br> - We would have helped him.<br> - Come on.<br> - Why didn't anybody come?<br> - It was a very nice funeral.<br> Where were the people he knew?<br> Maybe they blame him.<br> It's a rough world, Linda.<br> They wouldn't blame him.<br> I can't understand it.<br> First time in just about 35 years<br> we were almost free and clear.<br> He only needed a little salary.<br> He was even finished with the dentist.<br> No man only needs a little salary.<br> I can't understand it.<br> There were a lot of nice days when he'd<br> come home from a trip or on Sundays,<br> making the stoop,<br> finishing the cellar<br> when he built the extra bathroom<br> and put up the garage.<br> You know, Charley, I think there was<br> more of him in that front stoop<br> than in all the sales he ever made.<br> Yep. He was a happy man<br> with a bunch of cement.<br> He was wonderful with his hands.<br> He had the wrong dreams.<br> AII, all wrong.<br> Don't say that.<br> The man didn't know who he was.<br> Nobody dast blame this man.<br> You don't understand.<br> Willy was a salesman.<br> For a salesman,<br> there is no rock bottom to the life.<br> He don't put a bolt to a nut,<br> he don't tell you the law,<br> don't give you medicine.<br> He's a man way out there in the blue,<br> riding on a smile and a shoeshine.<br> When they start not smiling back,<br> that's an earthquake.<br> You get yourself a couple of spots<br> on your hat and you're finished.<br> Nobody dast blame this man.<br> A salesman has got to dream, boy.<br> Comes with the territory.<br> - The man didn't know who he was.<br> - Don't say that!<br> Why don't you come with me, Happy?<br> I'm not licked that easily.<br> I'm staying right in the city<br> and I'm gonna beat this racquet.<br> - Loman brothers.<br> - I know who I am, kid.<br> All right, boy,<br> I'm gonna show you and everybody<br> that Willy Loman did not die in vain.<br> He had a good dream.<br> It's the only dream you can have,<br> to come out number one man.<br> He fought it out here and this is where<br> I'm gonna win it for him.<br> Oh, I'll be with you in just a minute.<br> You go on, Charley.<br> Just... just a minute.<br> I never had a chance to say good-bye.<br> Help me, Willy.<br> I can't cry.<br> Seems to me you're just away on<br> another trip and I keep expecting you.<br> Why did you do it?<br> I search and I search,<br> and I search,<br> and I can't understand it, Willy.<br> I made the last payment<br> on the house today.<br> Today!<br> And there'll be nobody home.<br> We're free and clear.<br> We're free.<br> We're free.<br> We're free.<br>
