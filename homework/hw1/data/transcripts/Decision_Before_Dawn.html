                        Of all the questions<br> left unanswered by the last war-<br> and probably any war-<br> one comes back constantly to my mind-<br> - Why does a spy risk his life-<br> for what possible reasons?<br> If the spy wins, he's ignored.<br> lfhe loses, he's shot.<br> But a man stays alive as long as<br> he's remembered and is killed<br> only by forgetfulness.<br> Let the names of men like this<br> remain unknown...<br> but let the memories of some of them<br> serve as keys to the meanings of treason.<br> On the 8th of December, 1944,<br> six months after a piece of enemy shrapnel...<br> cut short my career with the Second Assault<br> and Signal Company on Omaha Beach...<br> I was reassigned by headquarters,<br> Com. "Z", E. T. O...<br> and ordered to report to a new outfit-<br> G2, S.S.S., Seventh Army.<br> That's what it was called.<br> There'd been no snow<br> and a lot of Krauts when I left France.<br> And now the Krauts were backed up against<br> the Rhine, and the snow was everywhere.<br> Otherwise, the war hadn't changed much-<br> crowded in the rear areas...<br> and lonely as you got nearer<br> and nearer the front...<br> with nothing but a map to tell you<br> where the enemy was supposed to be.<br> But you soon discovered<br> if your map was accurate enough.<br> - Hey, what's that?<br> - It's a German half-track. That's what it is.<br> I don't get it. That wasn't here<br> when I came by this morning.<br> - Well, let's turn around here<br> and find out where we are.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Stop right here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> I keep tellin' 'em back at headquarters...<br> I got no sense of direction,<br> but they just won't listen to me.<br> A soldier's not much good if he can't<br> find his way back to his own outfit.<br> - It's like not bein' able to find your way home.<br> - My home? My home's in Boise.<br> For cryin' out-<br> We've come 20 miles out of the way.<br> - Now we'll probably have to fight<br> our way through a whole Kraut-<br> Come on. Get outta there!<br> Give it up, you rats.<br> Come on! Move it on!<br> Keep your hands up.<br> - Over this way. Move.!<br> - Come on. Get the lead out.<br> Move over there.<br> That's close enough. Right there.<br> You frisk 'em.<br> I'll keep 'em covered.<br> Hey, you. I said, keep your hands up.<br> That's what I meant. Come on!<br> Stand still.<br> - Watch those hands, soldier.<br> - He was hit by shrapnel, sir.<br> - You're in the Luftwaffe.<br> What are you doin' around here?<br> - I'm with a flak group.<br> - We're attached to an infantry division.<br> - Yeah? Which one?<br> I'm sorry, sir, but I can't tell you anything<br> that isn't in my Soldbuch.<br> - Want me to refresh his memory, Lieutenant?<br> - Ah, leave him alone.<br> Where's your C.P.?<br> - I don't know. We got lost.<br> - They're not the only ones.<br> "Richter, Paul. Unteroffizier."<br> He's weak, sir.<br> We haven't eaten for three days.<br> Not half as weak as he's gonna be<br> if you don't keep those hands up.<br> - Here. You look like you<br> could use a shot yourself.<br> - No, thank you.<br> All right. Climb aboard.<br> All right. Out, soldiers.<br> - Where'd you pick 'em up, Lieutenant?<br> - About five miles from here.<br> Over here, you two.<br> Hey, I'm supposed to report to a town<br> called Marmoutier. You know where that is?<br> Stay on this road till you get to<br> a town called Saverne.<br> - Before you get into town,<br> take the first fork left. You can't miss it.<br> - Okay. Thanks.<br> Hey, here's their Soldbuchs.<br> - Hey, you want the pistol, Lieutenant?<br> - Yeah. Gimme that.<br> - Pistol.<br> - In there, you two.<br> Come on.<br> I want to thank you, sir,<br> for treating us with kindness.<br> Come on, Kraut-heads. Get movin'.<br> You're holdin' up the war.<br> Well, we finally<br> made it. Strange as it seemed to me then...<br> - this was the headquarters<br> to which I was assigned.<br> Just a moment, sir.<br> Sister Teresa's coming.<br> - Bonjour, MonsieurJean.<br> - How was the hunting this morning?<br> No good, Sister Beatrice.<br> There wasn't a chicken on the road.<br> - This is it, sir. Sorry about getting lost.<br> - Oh, forget it.<br> - I just hope this is the right place.<br> - Through here, sir.<br> The adjutant's office is right in the courtyard.<br> I'll get the bags to your room.<br> Hey, bud, how do I get<br> to the adjutant?<br> Around the corner to your left, sir.<br> Hey, Monique, will you show<br> the lieutenant the way?<br> - You wish to see le capitaine?<br> - Yeah, I guess so.<br> This way, please.<br> - The children are from the orphanage here.<br> - Oh. Of course.<br> - Here you are, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Monsieur Watkins, the officer<br> wants to see Capitaine Siebert.<br> - What can I do for you?<br> - This the headquarters of G2, S.S.S.?<br> - That's right.<br> I've got orders<br> to report here.<br> Oh. You're the new<br> communications officer.<br> Colonel Devlin will sure be glad to see you.<br> If you'll follow me, please.<br> Mm! Could I see<br> your A.G.O. card?<br> Sorry.<br> Security regulations.<br> Thanks.<br> - Morning, Sister Genevieve.<br> How are you today?<br> The sisters certainly take good care of us.<br> They've adopted us just like their orphans.<br> Yeah. It's quite a place.<br> We had a hard time finding one<br> until Captain Siebert located this.<br> We don't like to be too close to the army.<br> Sometimes they don't understand our procedure.<br> I can see their point.<br> After five years, they're fixing the place<br> up again. Our guys are tryin' to help.<br> - Up here?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Watkins, sir.<br> - What is it, Watkins?<br> - This is our new communications officer.<br> Here's his orders, sir.<br> - Lt. Rennick, reporting for duty.<br> Glad you finally got here. Sit down.<br> I'll be with you in a minute. Where was I?<br> - "That the intelligence penetration"-<br> - Oh, yes.<br> That the intelligence penetration<br> of Germany by French or Alsatian agents...<br> or by any non-German personnel is<br> practically an impossibility. Okay, Simonson?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Now for the rough part.<br> I ask that you reconsider our request<br> with the use of German prisoners<br> of war in our work.<br> We've already located many promising<br> candidates in several P.W. camps.<br> How about the men down<br> at the Sarrebourg cage?<br> - They said they'd hold 'em<br> another day or two, sir.<br> - All right.<br> These men, I believe, if properly trained<br> and used, can help save American lives.<br> - We intend to take only<br> volunteers, and in that case-<br> Pinpoint Forward.<br> Captain Siebert speaking.<br> Yes, he's here. Just a minute.<br> G2 Seventh Army, sir.<br> Devlin speaking. Yes, sir.<br> Then we can go ahead<br> as discussed?<br> Well, I'm sure you won't regret it.<br> Thank you, sir. Bye.<br> Forget the memo. The old boy came through.<br> Army says, try it out.<br> - That's very gracious of them.<br> - This calls for a drink,<br> don't you think, Colonel?<br> - Right. Break out the Quetch, Harold.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I forgot to introduce you.<br> - This is Gevers, Recruiting.<br> - Hi.<br> - Major Richards, our exec.<br> - Welcome to our club.<br> - Vincent, Documents.<br> - Hello, Lieutenant.<br> Siebert-Where is he?<br> Oh. Siebert, Security.<br> - Glad to meet you, Lieutenant.<br> - Sergeant Simonson...<br> - best red tape specialist,<br> both sides of the Atlantic.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - This is Lieutenant, uh-<br> What was your name again?<br> - Rennick.<br> That's right. Lieutenant Rennick.<br> Our new communications officer.<br> Richards, we'll want transportation<br> first thing in the morning for Sarrebourg.<br> Well, we're finally gonna pay a visit<br> to your German friends, Pete.<br> Pardon me, but if I may,<br> I'd like to talk with you about my duties.<br> Well, it can wait<br> till morning, can't it?<br> How about coming to Sarrebourg?<br> lt'll give you an idea of what it's all about.<br> - Votre sant, messieurs-<br> or should I say, prost.<br> - Prost.!<br> No, sir. Not me. When a man gets his life<br> handed back to him like I just did...<br> he'd be a fool<br> to put it up for sale again.<br> - I'll do any kind of work you want, but-<br> - Next man.<br> I have never been<br> interested in politics.<br> They forced me to join the party.<br> It was the only way I could get a promotion.<br> All right. Next man.<br> Sergeant Rudolph Barth reporting, sir.<br> At ease, Sergeant. Sit down.<br> - You smoke?<br> - Yes, sir. I do.<br> Dick?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Uh, not now.<br> What unit were you with<br> when captured?<br> Twenty-fourth Infantry-<br> or what was left of it.<br> - Did you desert?<br> - No, sir. I was caught by one<br> of your patrols while, uh-<br> while visiting the wife<br> of an Alsatian farmer.<br> She was a very lonely woman, sir.<br> How long have you been<br> in the Wehrmacht, Barth?<br> - Since '41, unfortunately.<br> - And before that?<br> I worked in a Panzer factory in Hamburg,<br> and before that I was with the circus.<br> Yes, sir. I took care of two tigers<br> and a lion- a lioness to be exact.<br> - I lost my job when the old woman died.<br> - Have you ever been in jail?<br> - Yes sir, in '36 in Dsseldorf<br> and in '42 in Norway.<br> - And what were the charges?<br> In civilian life, theft,<br> and in the army-<br> how shall I say-<br> uh, insubordination.<br> I hope it won't<br> count against me.<br> - And what are your political convictions?<br> - My political convictions?<br> - Never been able to afford any.<br> - Then why do you want to work for us?<br> Because you are winning the war.<br> Isn't that a good enough reason?<br> Well, good or bad,<br> I suppose it's a valid one.<br> In other words, you don't mind the general<br> disaster, as long as you come out ahead.<br> If you want to put it that way.<br> I guess a few years ago, for the same reason,<br> you were shouting, "Sieg heil."<br> No. Not that.<br> That was one swindle I never fell for.<br> They were too much like my cats<br> to suit me- dangerous to turn your back on.<br> Would you work for us<br> even if it meant risking your life?<br> I didn't expect the job<br> to be safe or pleasant.<br> Why should you take Germans for safe work<br> when your own people are in danger?<br> - All right, Sergeant. We'll think about it.<br> - Next.<br> This next guy's supposed to be<br> an experienced radioman.<br> - Pardon me. May I ask you<br> a question now, sir?<br> - What is it?<br> How much do you pay?<br> Thanks a lot, Sergeant. Don't forget to keep<br> our guys separated from the others.<br> I know what you mean, sir.<br> I'll take care of it. This way, sir.<br> - Look.<br> - I wonder what he's doing here.<br> Don't you know? They look for<br> volunteers who will work for them.<br> - Have they found any?<br> - Yes. But there are men here<br> who will remember their names.<br> And someday, when we've won,<br> they'll be taken care of.<br> "When we've won"? You still believe in that?<br> Here they come-<br> the volunteers.<br> Look at them. They are ready to do<br> anything just to save their own hides.<br> - Like most of us.<br> - What did you say?<br> Yes, we are no different<br> from them.<br> We didn't care what happened to others<br> as long as they didn't bother any of us.<br> We just closed our eyes and went along<br> until we found ourselves<br> forced to fight the wrong enemy.<br> You sound as if you're all set<br> to join the Americans yourself.<br> I don't know.<br> That takes courage.<br> The trouble with me is I want to stay alive.<br> Like most of us, I talk but I do nothing.<br> Paul? Paul, are you asleep?<br> No. What is it?<br> Did you see their faces<br> this morning out in the yard?<br> Yes. For some of them,<br> nothing is changed- even now.<br> Richter, the Amis<br> want you for questioning.<br> - The Americans want me now?<br> - Yes. Come with me.<br> Sergeant Paul Richter...<br> you are facing a court-martial<br> of the Wehrmacht.<br> You are accused of treason<br> against your fhrer and your fatherland.<br> Have you anything to say<br> in your defense?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Eavesdropping, eh?<br> Get it over with.<br> Quick!<br> - What happened?<br> - One of the P. W.'s<br> fell out of the window.<br> Let's get him inside<br> before there's more trouble.<br> - Hey, you fellas,<br> come over with that light.<br> - All right.<br> - Break it up, guys.<br> - Come on. There's nothing to look at.<br> Break it up, I said.<br> Get back to your bunks.<br> - Which room did the guy fall from?<br> - Fall? Are you kidding?<br> He was pushed.<br> Better keep<br> your mouth shut, Junge.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> Well, what about you?<br> Let's go.<br> - Monsieur Rennick. Monsieur Rennick.<br> - Yeah?<br> Sergeant Watkins asked me to tell you,<br> there is a German to see you<br> downstairs. A soldier.<br> - Morning, Griffin.<br> - Morning, sir.<br> You wanted to see me?<br> What's it all about?<br> I remembered you from<br> the morning I was captured, sir.<br> I thought maybe you can help me.<br> - The morning you were captured?<br> - Don't you remember those Krauts<br> we picked up in Hagenau woods?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> How's your friend doin'?<br> He was killed, sir, ten days ago.<br> He was killed? By whom?<br> - He was murdered<br> by some of the other prisoners.<br> - Yeah, I heard about that.<br> - He was pushed out of a window, wasn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> - Coffee, Dick?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Is that why you came here?<br> - No, sir.<br> It is-Well...<br> I want to work for you, and I thought<br> you might be able to help me.<br> - You know what you're gettin' into?<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> Even if it means fighting<br> against your own people?<br> I believe fighting against them now<br> is fighting for them.<br> You sure it isn't the murder of your friend<br> that's prompting you to do this?<br> No, sir. That was only<br> the last thing that happened.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> Look, it's none of my business,<br> but the job you'll have to do here...<br> isn't as clean and simple<br> as you may think.<br> I don't feel there's any difference<br> between one way of fighting or another.<br> Isn't the important thing to believe in<br> what you're fighting for?<br> Well, what do you believe in?<br> Do you know?<br> Or does it change<br> when your crowd's taking a beating?<br> Pete, got a cigarette? Sit down, Corporal.<br> Don't let me interrupt.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Go ahead. What do you believe in?<br> I don't quite know<br> how to say it...<br> but I believe in a life<br> in which one is not always afraid...<br> in a life in which people are free<br> and honest with each other.<br> And I know we won't have this<br> in Germany... until- until we have lost.<br> That sounds great. What makes you so sure<br> you'll be able to stick to these convictions?<br> Things will change.<br> You'll be facing your own people.<br> It may become hard for you<br> then to hold on to your beliefs.<br> No, not any harder<br> than it has been.<br> Not any harder than fighting<br> for something I knew was wrong.<br> You were a medic.<br> You didn't really fight.<br> To be there is to fight.<br> There's something in what you say,<br> Corporal. Griffin. Griffin!<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Tell Major Richards I want to<br> keep this man here a few days.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - We'll let you know.<br> This way.<br> Seems like a decent kid.<br> What do you think, Pete?<br> Yeah, quite unusual<br> in this racket.<br> As a matter of fact, he looks like<br> one of the few Krauts we can trust.<br> How about you, Rennick?<br> I'm a signal officer, sir. I'm sorry, I...<br> really have no opinion about any of them.<br> That didn't seem to be<br> the case a moment ago.<br> The way you talked to this kid sounded as<br> if you had a pretty definite point of view.<br> - What is it?<br> - Well, if you want to know, sir, l-<br> I think they're all<br> a bunch of lice.<br> If I had to make a choice, I'd go along with<br> this guy from the circus. He's a crook...<br> but at least he doesn't kid himself<br> about why he's workin' for us.<br> I think you're wrong<br> about the boy, Rennick.<br> There are all kinds of traitors.<br> I have no more sympathy with 'em than you.<br> But our personal feelings are unimportant<br> as long as these men are serving our cause.<br> That's why from now on, when you're<br> on the job, you'll have only one opinion-<br> and that's the right one<br> for the job.<br> - Everything set for tonight?<br> - Yes. 0200 hours. Tiger and Freddy.<br> Be sure and check their briefing<br> before you take them through.<br> It's their first time.<br> Oh, and Pete, I want Lieutenant Rennick<br> to go along. It may do you some good.<br> That's all. See you later.<br> 0200 hours. Apiece of no-man's-land...<br> was indicated by Division G2 as a spot<br> where two of our agents,<br> known as Tiger and Freddy...<br> were to be smuggled<br> through enemy lines.<br> They were to secure information<br> on S.S. and elite troops in this sector.<br> It was... a so-called<br> "tourist"mission.<br> - Minefield. Wait here.<br> - Minefield. Wait.<br> - Mines.<br> Remember, the most important thing<br> is exact map coordinates for your report.<br> No report at all is better than one<br> in which you're not 100% sure.<br> - That's simple. What I want to know is-<br> - Just let me do the talkin'.<br> Tiger, what I was tryin'<br> to say is sometimes, out of ambition...<br> you're apt to exaggerate-<br> report things you haven't seen.<br> - Me? I never lie.<br> - That's exactly what I meant.<br> You may not lie,<br> but you certainly exaggerate.<br> - Okay. We can go now. Single file.<br> - Come on. Single file.<br> The captain said he'd give us<br> a short artillery barrage just for cover.<br> It should start<br> at any moment now.<br> That's it.<br> Better get them ready, Lieutenant.<br> - Okay?<br> - Freddy, you first.<br> Don't forget, your danger<br> signal's a group of five "D's."<br> Time of transmission- 2400.<br> - I want to ask a question.<br> - What is it?<br> - Who is the captain of the team?<br> Who is in command?<br> - Quiet!<br> - You are, Tiger. And you're<br> responsible for your teammate.<br> - All right. As long as I know.<br> - Okay. Good luck to both of you.<br> - Go ahead. I'll follow you.<br> Okay. But remember, from now on<br> I'm giving orders. Let's go.<br> North. Just keep to your left.<br> We'll stop 'em in just a moment.<br> The German lines are<br> about 300 yards over there.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> One, two, three, four.<br> - Dede, take over.<br> - Hey, Lang, here's a new guest for your hotel.<br> Yeah.<br> I know all about him. Over here.<br> Ready? Exercise.<br> One, two, three, four. One, two-<br> Monique. Hey, Monique.<br> This is the man we got the file<br> on this morning. Code name's "Happy."<br> Yes, sir. I'll- I'll put him in<br> with Tiger and Fritz.<br> - Well, lotsa luck. You're in good hands now.<br> - Follow me, please.<br> The cot near the window.<br> You make your own bed here.<br> All personal belongings will be turned over<br> to me, and you will get a receipt for them.<br> And what about my wallet?<br> They took it away from me.<br> I had a couple of photographs<br> of my mother and father. I would<br> like to keep them if possible.<br> All your personal documents<br> will be kept in the headquarters' safe<br> until the war is over.<br> - You have been told<br> your code name is "Happy"?<br> - Yes.<br> As you will see by this list of regulations,<br> under no circumstances...<br> will you reveal your true name<br> or identity to anyone.<br> Remember that.<br> All right now, Happy.<br> Ho-o-old it.<br> Good.<br> - Father's name?<br> - Friedrich Maurer.<br> - Profession?<br> - A doctor. He's a surgeon.<br> - When did you last see him?<br> - Uh, about a year ago in Berlin.<br> He was in charge<br> of the hospital there.<br> I thought in America<br> only criminals were fingerprinted.<br> Come on, boys.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Over here.<br> Over here.<br> Come on.<br> Let's go. Hurry up.<br> Here is an example<br> of the Wehrmacht blacklist.<br> It's the greatest single danger<br> that confronts an agent in the Reich.<br> It carries the names of all suspects.<br> It's brought up to date<br> by a weekly supplement...<br> which carries the number<br> of the week on its cover.<br> - Hey, what's the matter, Happy?<br> - Move it out.<br> Come on. Stay on your feet.<br> Don't let that chute drag you.<br> No. Pull hard<br> on the bottom line.<br> - Rennick! Rennick-<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Rennick! Rennick-<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - When was our last radio contact with Freddy?<br> - About four nights ago.<br> - Did he send his danger signal?<br> - No. He came in on schedule-<br> stayed on the air for about 20 minutes,<br> from midnight on.<br> According to your notes, wasn't that<br> the evening he said he last saw him?<br> Yes, sir-<br> at approximately 9:00.<br> What do you want me to assume-<br> Lieutenant Rennick is lying<br> and you're telling the truth?<br> - I don't know I... may have made<br> a mistake. I'm sorry.<br> - You may have made a mistake.<br> We warned you before you left<br> that you were responsible for<br> the safety of your teammate.<br> You show up with a story. He was<br> picked up by the Wehrmacht<br> and shipped to the eastern front.<br> I'm telling the truth. I warned him not<br> to go out at night, but he wouldn't listen.<br> - How do you know they shipped him<br> to the eastern front?<br> - I had friends in Mannheim.<br> - One of them checked on it.<br> - Wait a minute. Didn't you say before...<br> you couldn't get along with Freddy-<br> you had some kind of an argument?<br> - Were you lyin' then or now?<br> - I am not lying, sir.<br> Yes, we had an argument. I got mad and<br> hit him. And he- he ran out in the street.<br> - Why didn't you tell us that before?<br> - I did.<br> I just didn't say it was the same night.<br> I... was frightened, that's all.<br> You know as well as I do,<br> before summer is over we'll be in<br> Germany, in every city and town.<br> If you've betrayed us, double agent<br> or plain crook you'll wind<br> up in front of a firing squad.<br> I have nothing to worry about.<br> I haven't been disloyal, sir. I haven't-<br> - Get him out of here. Watkins.<br> - Yes, sir. Come on.!<br> - Give me a chance to prove<br> what I've said is true.<br> - Get out!<br> Got a cigarette, Rennick?<br> - Not the best liar I've heard,<br> but certainly the biggest.<br> - Wonder how much Krauts paid him.<br> Pete, I want him sent back to theJoe house<br> and treated as if nothing had happened.<br> - Siebert, get C.I.C. on it right<br> away, and tell 'em it's urgent.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hello. Get me Captain<br> Hendrickson, 708 Cadet Forward, please.<br> I know it sounds crazy,<br> but he may be telling the truth.<br> He's too smart a liar<br> to lie that badly.<br> Well, what's new<br> in Company "D"?<br> Say, you know what<br> the "D" stands for?<br> "The damned."<br> That's what we are.<br> Here, Moniquechen. If anyone<br> deserves a second helping tonight, I do.<br> I don't have to tell you, the food on the<br> other side of our glorious Rhine stinks.<br> What's the matter<br> with all of you?<br> I go out and do a job while<br> the rest of you sit here by the fire...<br> and when I come back<br> you look at me as if-<br> - Well, for heaven's sake, say something.<br> - What happened to Freddy?<br> - He was your teammate, wasn't he?<br> - Sure he was, and he got caught.<br> So what?<br> That's a chance everyone of us takes.<br> Anyway, I remember none of you<br> were this upset about Red when he got lost.<br> - Red? That was different.<br> - How do you know it was?<br> - What do any of you know<br> about it, huh? Nothing.<br> - Listen to him talk.<br> Freddy got caught because he wasn't<br> smart enough. He was dumb, thick-headed-<br> like the rest of you!<br> Silence, Tiger!<br> And knock it off, all of ya's.<br> All right. Forget it.<br> Here. You haven't forgotten the old song,<br> "Will This All Be Remembered"?<br> Well, they are playing it<br> all over again.<br> - Um, may I have a cup of coffee, please?<br> - Sure.<br> - Who was Red?<br> - A boy who missed his pinpoint.<br> He didn't jump when<br> the green light went on.<br> He landed 20 miles<br> off his target outside an S.S. barracks...<br> with his parachute<br> tangled in a tree.<br> It doesn't happen often.<br> You don't have to be afraid.<br> I'm not- not of the jump, anyway.<br> Then what are you afraid of?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to be inquisitive.<br> Oh, that's all right.<br> I don't mind.<br> You know, once I was doing the same job,<br> and I, too, was afraid the first time I jumped.<br> Maybe in a different way,<br> but that's why I think<br> I know what's bothering you.<br> You do? What is it?<br> You are afraid of having to face<br> your own people, aren't you?<br> Come in.<br> - Officer messenger, sir, with a dispatch.<br> - Yes?<br> - Colonel Devlin?<br> - That's right.<br> This is from Colonel Williamson, sir.<br> Top secret.<br> Come on. Hurry it up. Bringin' you guys<br> together is getting tougher every day.<br> - What's it all about, anyway?<br> - Shh. Quiet.<br> All right, gentlemen,<br> here's the dope.<br> GeneralJaeger, commanding the Fourth Corps<br> here along the east bank of the Rhine...<br> sent emissaries to Switzerland informing us<br> he's willing to surrender his entire corps...<br> as soon as he can establish<br> contact with our troops.<br> He's also requested that we put in<br> a radio mission hidden here in Mannheim...<br> to act as a communications link between<br> his headquarters and us. Is that clear?<br> - Sure.<br> - Well, looks as if the Krauts<br> have finally wised up.<br> G2 has approved Jaeger's request and<br> asked that we put in a tourist mission...<br> about 250 miles behind this sector<br> here in the vicinity of Munich<br> to find out how much...<br> mobile strength the Germans<br> can bring up to close in the gap<br> in case the surrender comes off.<br> G2 also suspects that elements<br> of the 11 th Panzer Corps...<br> are being held back here as a mobile reserve<br> to be thrown in wherever needed.<br> Now the Mannheim job will require<br> a team of one radio operator...<br> and a first-class agent who<br> really knows the town and has<br> contacts there he can depend on.<br> - Who've you got in mind, Colonel?<br> - Now don't all jump on me.<br> - The only man who can do it<br> is our friend Barth, the Tiger.<br> Here's the C.I.C. report that came in<br> yesterday on the Tiger's first mission.<br> They checked his story, and it seems<br> that everything he said was true.<br> Furthermore G2 has given<br> his intelligence mission an "A" rating.<br> - Besides that, he was-<br> - Was born and raised in Mannheim.<br> Right. That's why no matter how<br> we feel about him, at the moment<br> he's the logical choice.<br> What about his teammate,<br> the radioman?<br> I'd like to talk about that later.<br> First let's take up the tourist mission.<br> I want to send Happy.<br> Any objections?<br> No, sir. But, so help me,<br> I don't get sending the Tiger.<br> - Richards, is Monique here?<br> - Yes, sir. She's waiting outside.<br> Ask her to come in. Hold your horses, Pete.<br> He's not on the plane yet.<br> - Okay, Bob?<br> - Yeah. Okay.<br> Come in,<br> honey.<br> Sit down, Monique. Would you care<br> for a cup of coffee or a cigarette?<br> Cigarette's okay, sir.<br> Tell us about the Tiger, Monique.<br> Have you noticed anything recently<br> that we should hear about?<br> No, sir. He hasn't changed.<br> As usual, he doesn't get along with the<br> others, and he's difficult, but that's all.<br> - How would you feel about<br> sending him out again?<br> - I would send him, sir.<br> - I'm all for that, if it's<br> just to get rid of him.<br> - Okay. How about Happy?<br> - I think that, in many ways,<br> he's the best of them all.<br> - Why?<br> Because-Well, because<br> he's the first German...<br> I've known who really believes<br> in what he's doing.<br> Do you think he's ready to go?<br> What's the matter, Monique?<br> There is only one thing that<br> might make it difficult for him...<br> maybe because<br> he's young and honest.<br> He may begin to doubt himself<br> once he's back in his own country.<br> If this mission is difficult,<br> I think it would be better to wait.<br> Come here a minute, Monique.<br> Their first service since the Germans left.<br> Look, we've known each other<br> for quite a while. The deal<br> I made with you in Algiers...<br> before you jumped into France was that<br> you'd always be on the level with me.<br> - Right?<br> - Yes.<br> Then I wanna ask you something.<br> I know what you said about Happy is true...<br> but I feel there's something<br> you didn't tell me.<br> - What?<br> - Are you in love with him?<br> He's a Boche, sir, like all the others.<br> We have too much to forget<br> before we can love any of them.<br> - May I go now?<br> - Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Richards.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> I want Monique transferred.<br> Do we have another job for her?<br> - I'll see what I can do.<br> Would Station "K" be all right?<br> - Sure. Sure, that's fine.<br> Now about the radioman<br> for the Mannheim mission-<br> the Germans have requested that one member<br> of the mission be an American officer.<br> Army agrees. They feel it'll show<br> we mean business.<br> Therefore, it's clear in this case that<br> the American will have to be the radioman.<br> - Go ahead, Colonel.<br> - You're with me, Rennick.<br> I can't order you to do this,<br> and under the circumstances...<br> I'm sure none of us<br> would blame you if you said no.<br> Can't we get an officer from the<br> Army Communications Center?<br> We could train him in a few days.<br> You couldn't train him even in a few weeks.<br> If you're worried about Tiger, I can handle him.<br> He'd have a hard time<br> pushin' me around.<br> I don't get you.<br> A few weeks ago...<br> - you didn't seem<br> to like this job very much.<br> - Well, he changed his mind.<br> No. I haven't. I still don't like it,<br> but we have no choice.<br> Besides, you said it was important,<br> didn't you, Colonel?<br> - Anybody got a cigarette?<br> - Yeah. Sure.<br> You know I don't smoke.<br> Well, it fits you fine, sir.<br> Well, let's check your gear.<br> - Your shovel- that goes here.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Your landing gun, chute pack, helmet,<br> gloves- the rucksack's for your radio.<br> - You better put it in yourself<br> so you know it's all right.<br> - Good.<br> - Everything okay, Rennick?<br> - No complaints so far, sir.<br> - Did you pack the chute yourself, Willows?<br> - Yes. I packed them this morning.<br> I see you've got all your medals on, Barth-<br> maybe even a couple of extras.<br> No, sir. They are all my own. Iron Cross<br> in Norway, Sturmabzeichen in France...<br> and winter campaign, '41 in the east.<br> - I wonder how many of our guys<br> he knocked off to get them.<br> - None, sir.<br> I got them all in my own special way.<br> At your orders, Herr Oberst.<br> - Don't fall in love with that.<br> You have to bury your gear once you land.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - You can go draw your<br> personal supplies now. Martin.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - Take him over to the prop shop.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What's the takeoff time?<br> - 0100 hours, sir. That's if the weather holds.<br> - Good. When they're through here,<br> bring 'em to the briefing room.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Got your check-off list?<br> - Yes.<br> Here, honey.<br> Check this guy out.<br> One compass, German cigarettes-<br> three packages...<br> Wehrmacht ration stamps,<br> Benzedrines- five tablets.<br> They're stimulants.<br> Don't take more than one a day.<br> German razor blades- six-<br> and one razor...<br> German maps-<br> Sheet Y3, Y4, Y5.<br> Let's see. That's all.<br> - Good luck to you.<br> - Thank you, Monique.<br> Okay, Happy. Here you are, Monique,<br> two more customers.<br> If there's anything else<br> you can think of, sir, just let me know.<br> If you're all through, Happy,<br> the colonel wants you in the briefing room.<br> Yes, sir.<br> These are his papers, sir.<br> His Soldbuch with his health record<br> inside and his orders.<br> Money and his Wehrmacht<br> travel certificates are in this envelope.<br> All right, Happy. Let's go over it once more.<br> What name are you traveling under?<br> Steiner, Karl, a Luftwaffe medic-<br> number L43587.<br> We took his age, place ofbirth,<br> etc., out ofhis own Soldbuch.<br> Well, at least you didn't have to<br> memorize that. What's your cover?<br> I'm on sick leave, returning<br> from Base Hospital 12 at Bad Reichenhall.<br> - What was the doctor's name<br> who signed your orders?<br> - Foerster. I had pneumonia.<br> - We marked it on the health record<br> with Code number 7.<br> - Good.<br> Now show me your pinpoint.<br> It's here, east of Mnchen,<br> near Fridolfing.<br> After I bury my chute and my gear, I go to<br> Mnchen by way of Wasserburg Highway.<br> - I am to make my way back<br> to my outfit near Mannheim.<br> - And your route?<br> It's Mnchen, Augsburg,<br> Stuttgart, and then Mannheim.<br> - And what's your objective?<br> - To locate the 11 th Panzer Corps.<br> Their headquarters are believed to be in<br> this area somewhere northwest of Mnchen.<br> - Suppose you change your route?<br> - For that I have an extra set of<br> travel orders and a date stamp.<br> Right. Here they are- extra set of orders,<br> date stamp, official Wehrmacht seal.<br> - Mark your map so that no one<br> except you can interpret it.<br> - I know, sir.<br> Pardon me, sir. Rennick and the Tiger<br> are ready for you. We haven't got much time.<br> Bring them in. Get back here, Happy.<br> Even if you haven't done it all...<br> - you've gotta be back here in five days.<br> - I will, sir.<br> Okay, Happy.<br> - Well, how does it feel<br> to be a civilian again?<br> - Fine.<br> Just tell the pilot<br> to drop me in Cleveland, Ohio.<br> If you want to get back to Cleveland,<br> better concentrate on this.<br> Where's your pinpoint?<br> It's a meadow about five kilometers<br> south of Beerfelden, sir.<br> - You know exactly where that is?<br> - I've only been starin' at it<br> on a map for three solid days.<br> In case you're separated on landing,<br> what's the address<br> of the safe house in Mannheim?<br> - Eighteen Neckarstrasse, second floor, rear.<br> - Eighteen? You're sure? Not 28?<br> - Eighteen.<br> - Knock off the kidding, Pete.<br> How about you, Barth?<br> Are you certain your people in Mannheim<br> will let the lieutenant in?<br> Yes. He must knock four times<br> with an interval after the first two.<br> - When they open, he has only to say,<br> "Greetings from the Tiger."<br> - Okay.<br> We told GeneralJaeger's people<br> where they can contact you.<br> Now is there anything else?<br> Yeah- one little thing.<br> While we're all talking<br> here together as friends...<br> I'd just like to say that what happened<br> to Freddy is not gonna happen to me.<br> If I get caught, it won't be my fault.<br> Is that clear?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He means just what he said.<br> Lieutenant Rennick is not likely<br> to want to take a walk around<br> Mannheim just for the fun of it.<br> Furthermore, in any disagreement<br> that might come, no matter what,<br> Rennick will always be right.<br> Get that through your head, Barth.<br> Lieutenant Rennick will always be right.<br> - I don't know. Sometimes<br> I'd rather go than stay behind.<br> - Don't kid yourself, brother.<br> Get ready.<br> We're approaching the first target.<br> Action stations!<br> The address!<br> I forgot the address in Mannheim.<br> - What?<br> - I forgot the address!<br> - Eighteen Neckarstrasse. Eighteen!<br> - Target!<br> Eighteen Neckarstrasse. Eighteen.!<br> Eighteen Neckarstrasse. Eighteen.<br> Well, bud,<br> how does it feel to be going home?<br> Home?<br> Fine, I hope.<br> - Well, if you're hungry, Amigo<br> here'll give you a sandwich.<br> - No, thank you.<br> Well, hasta luego, muchachos. I'll let you<br> know a few minutes before we approach.<br> - Are you an American?<br> - Why? Don't I look like one?<br> - I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.<br> - You didn't, huh?<br> I just hope that before this is over,<br> I can get a crack at a couple<br> of squareheads like you.<br> - You hate us, don't you?<br> - Call it anything you like.<br> I haven't yet felt sorry...<br> when I've seen a string of 100-pounders<br> leave that bomb rack.<br> - Here's some coffee.<br> - Thank you.<br> The pilot wants you to know you may<br> be a mile or two off the pinpoint. Come on.<br> Stand by.!<br> Target!<br> Next stop,<br> Mnchen, center of town.<br> All men proceeding further<br> than Mnchen will stamp their orders...<br> at the Frontleitstelle<br> in the main station.<br> Extra! Extra!<br> Mnchener Post.<br> Say, have you got 10 pfennigs?<br> Too bad, but I have no change. Just a-<br> - Here. Here's a mark.<br> - Thank you.<br> Here, Mutter.<br> Keep the change.<br> - What are you looking for?<br> - Uh, the Frontleitstelle, please.<br> - Right over there.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm returning to my unit<br> from the hospital in Bad Reichenhall.<br> Who took this week's security list?<br> - Number nine hasn't come in yet.<br> Here's last week's list.<br> - Thank you.<br> Steiner, Steiner, Steiner-<br> Steiner. All right.<br> To Mannheim by the way<br> of Augsburg, Ulm, Stuttgart.<br> You get your train information<br> from the Wehrmacht Kontroller<br> outside on the platform. Next.<br> Uh, please, I have a friend<br> in the 11 th Panzer Corps.<br> - Do you know where their headquarters are?<br> - Eleventh Panzer Corps?<br> - I heard they were around here somewhere.<br> - Weren't they in Frth?<br> - Yes, it's just outside of Nuremberg.<br> - Thanks.<br> - To Freiburg.<br> - Please don't crowd.<br> One at a time.<br> - Anything wrong with my ticket?<br> - Wait a moment.<br> I'll just check with the Unteroffizier.<br> - Uh, when is the next train<br> to Nuremberg, Frulein?<br> - Your orders?<br> I don't know if the track to Nuremberg<br> is repaired. Wait a minute.<br> - Sure it is. There's a train at 9:30.<br> - Trudy, Nuremberg all right?<br> - Yes. They just finished<br> working on the track.<br> - Guess you were right.<br> I usually am, Frulein.<br> Come on. Track seven.<br> The night is shorter<br> when you have someone to talk to.<br> Say, I hope you don't mind, but,<br> uh, I've been meaning to ask you.<br> Where did you get all your money?<br> - What money?<br> - That fat roll you<br> carry in your pocket.<br> I just got back pay for three months.<br> Besides, it isn't very much.<br> Well, I really don't care how much it is,<br> as long as you'll kindly agree to...<br> Ioan me-<br> let's say- half of it?<br> - Now let me explain it to you.<br> I'm simply in need of cash...<br> and I'm perfectly willing<br> to let you profit by it.<br> Here. Take your choice. Where else in our<br> country could you get a better deal?<br> Paper for gold.<br> The fat stomach this used to go around,<br> I assure you, is much thinner now.<br> But maybe this. This is a better<br> investment for a young man like you.<br> It comes from a good marriage.<br> I think they had been together-<br> yeah- 25 years. How about it?<br> No thanks.<br> I don't plan to get married.<br> Well, that's up to you.<br> But if you change your mind,<br> remember, you'll be helping a friend.<br> Who knows?<br> Maybe someday you'll need one.<br> I think we better get some sleep now.<br> You know, sometimes I envy<br> you fellows at the front.<br> At least you can save your money.<br> Me, I spend all mine here-<br> on trains or busses<br> or, at best, on my motorcycle.<br> I'm Scholtz, special courier<br> of the Waffen S.S. Some title, eh?<br> But money? No.<br> Well-<br> happy dreams, Corporal.<br> Your main objective<br> is to locate the 11 th Panzer Corps.<br> Weren't they in Frth?<br> Are you sure<br> you'll stick to your convictions?<br> You'll be facing your own people.<br> The fat stomach<br> this used to go around, I assure you...<br> is much thinner now.<br> It may become hard<br> for you then to hold on to your beliefs.<br> Halt.! Hey.! Halt.!<br> Everybody out.! Halt.!<br> Halt! Halt!<br> Come on. Keep moving.<br> We have to clear the track.<br> Other trains are coming.<br> Come on.<br> Hey! What's going on?<br> Is this Nuremberg?<br> That's right. They hit us<br> for three hours this morning.<br> Keep in line.<br> - Keep in line.<br> - You'll all be<br> rerouted at the Frontleitstelle.<br> Attention. Left face. March. Hut. Hut.<br> Would you know if the 11 th Panzer Corps<br> is still in Frth?<br> Eleventh Panzer Corps?<br> No, I don't.<br> How do I get to Frth, please?<br> Can't you read? Over there.<br> Don't crowd, please. Don't crowd.<br> Keep moving, please.<br> - My sister was bombed out last night-<br> - Oh, excuse me.<br> - for the third time.<br> - How long can it go on?<br> - How long can they expect us<br> to live like this?<br> - Shh! Don't talk like that.<br> Yes. And then he kept<br> complaining about the food.<br> "You get it all at the front,"<br> I told him.<br> He laughed like he was crazy.<br> Fritz, my own son.<br> Karl.! Karl.!<br> Herr Maurer. Excuse me.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> You're Karl Maurer, aren't you?<br> Don't you remember me?<br> I'm Paula Schneider.<br> I worked for your father in Berlin.<br> Sure, I remember.<br> You were the head nurse at his clinic.<br> I suppose it's the uniform.<br> It does make us all look different.<br> - How long have you been<br> in the Luftwaffe?<br> - I was called in '43.<br> Look at you. I remember<br> when you first started school.<br> You were still living<br> across from the clinic.<br> That was a long time ago, wasn't it?<br> Nuremburg west, control point.<br> All passengers out.<br> I saw your father yesterday<br> at the base hospital in Wrzburg.<br> - You saw my father?<br> - Yes. Did you know he was stationed there?<br> Oh, yes. I heard he was<br> transferred from Berlin.<br> He's better off in Wrzburg.<br> Safer, I hope. Are you going to see him?<br> I'm trying to get permission<br> to stop there.<br> Well, they'll give it to you. Just tell them<br> you haven't seen your father for a long time.<br> - Name and rank?<br> - Schneider, Paula. F.P.N. 347.<br> All right, go ahead.<br> Name and rank?<br> Uh, I'm afraid I didn't have<br> my orders stamped today.<br> You'll have to see the Feldwebel.<br> He's at the main control point.<br> Excuse me. Maybe I can help.<br> I know the corporal very well.<br> His father is chief surgeon at the Wrzburg<br> base hospital. If you want, I can vouch for-<br> Don't worry, Frulein Schneider.<br> It's just a formality. Go ahead.<br> - Well, when you see your father,<br> please give him my best.<br> - I will. Thank you.<br> - Auf Wiedersehen. Heil Hitler.<br> - Heil Hitler.<br> Hey, where you going? It's up there<br> on your left next to the monument.<br> This is the control point,<br> not the Kommandatur.<br> I can't help you if your papers<br> aren't in order. Come on, get moving.<br> I know. I know. Not you.<br> I can't let you through.<br> - Corporal Steiner reporting, sir.<br> - Yes?<br> I didn't have a chance to get<br> my orders stamped in Nuremburg.<br> I'm looking for H.Q., 11 th Corps.<br> Eleventh Corps? They moved<br> a couple of days ago to Crailsheim.<br> I see you've been<br> in the army two years.<br> Don't you know you should<br> have your orders stamped?<br> Say, look who's coming.<br> Hey, Heinz.<br> What happened to you?<br> I haven't seen you<br> and your tin horse for quite a while.<br> Just back from a trip east.<br> But as you see...<br> it didn't take long for them<br> to get me on the road again.<br> I'm on my way to Wrzburg now.<br> Well, if it isn't the corporal.<br> - Do you know him?<br> - Know him? Why, he's a good friend of mine.<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - No, nothing serious.<br> I'll let you through this time.<br> - This man with Corporal Scholtz can pass.<br> - Okay.<br> Thanks. I'll be back tomorrow.<br> See, sometimes it's good to have a friend.<br> Where are you going?<br> I'm trying to get to<br> Crailsheim by tonight.<br> Well, if you don't mind a little<br> detour, I'll give you a ride. Come on.<br> I'll be right back. Just have to make<br> a pickup at the Kommandatur.<br> Frau Karen? Frau Karen,<br> can I have 10 liters?<br> Certainly, sir.<br> There's always some for you.<br> - Good day, sir.<br> - Badly hit here in Wrzburg, weren't you?<br> Yes. Last fall.<br> But it's coming back to life again.<br> They moved a big chemical plant<br> into town last month from East Prussia.<br> Uh, there is a base hospital<br> here, isn't there?<br> Yes, up there on the Berg.<br> Most of the casualties from<br> the west come through here.<br> - It's next to the factory.<br> - Uh, do you have a phone?<br> Inside. It's an army line.<br> It's to your right.<br> - Yes?<br> - The base hospital, please.<br> - Hello.<br> - Uh, base hospital?<br> - Yes.<br> - Can I talk to Dr. Maurer?<br> Dr. Friedrich Maurer?<br> Hold the line, please.<br> I'll connect you with him.<br> Hello?<br> Hello. This is Dr. Maurer.<br> - Operator, did you ring me?<br> - Yes, sir. The party's still on the line.<br> I can't hear them. Hello. Hello!<br> Are you calling Dr. Maurer? Hello.<br> Operator, this must be a mistake.<br> Got some friends here?<br> I thought I had.<br> Well, I know a good place where we can<br> spend the night, right near Crailsheim.<br> It's a little out of the way,<br> but it's worth it.<br> - Heil Hitler, Frau Karen.<br> - Heil Hitler.<br> There's no more room tonight.<br> Everything's taken.<br> I know. I know.<br> I tell you there's no more room.<br> - Is Frau Kollwitz across the alley?<br> - There's nothing she can do-<br> Come on.<br> One of the few places<br> left in Germany...<br> where a soldier can get a clean bed<br> and a bottle of wine.<br> - That is, if he has money.<br> - Or if he has a friend who will pay for him.<br> That's right.<br> - Hey, is Fritzi around?<br> - Fritzi? Yeah, I just saw her.<br> - Say, don't I know you?<br> - You? I can't quite remember.<br> - Liar. Is Fritzi in the office?<br> - Uh, yeah, there.<br> Take care of my friend here.<br> I'll be right back.<br> There's still some wine left<br> for special guests. Want it?<br> - Is this place legal?<br> - It's as much a part of<br> the Wehrmacht as your Luftwaffe.<br> Only the dancing is illegal. But then again,<br> it all depends on how you look at it.<br> - Want the change?<br> - No, never mind.<br> Oh, thanks. I would never have asked<br> before, but now I would starve if I didn't.<br> We're only open two days a week.<br> - Isn't the 11 th Panzer Corps<br> stationed somewhere around here?<br> - Two beer.<br> They were in Crailsheim, right<br> near here, but they've gone.<br> A few clerks are all that's left.<br> And once in a while<br> we get some transients, like you.<br> - Want to dance?<br> - No, thank you.<br> I thought you weren't<br> supposed to nowadays.<br> We're not supposed to have wine either,<br> but that doesn't seem to bother you.<br> You must know your way around here.<br> How about getting me a glass?<br> Well, go ahead. I'm not thirsty.<br> Well, thank you, sir.<br> We interrupt this<br> broadcast to bring you the latest news.<br> On the western front, in the vicinity<br> of Mannheim-<br> Hey! Turn it off.<br> - Come on Kurt.<br> - Come on Kurt. We want music.<br> - Yeah, let's have some music.<br> - How about waltz?<br> ...heavy enemy pressure near Koblenz.<br> - Still interested in that?<br> - Does it bother you?<br> - No. Just bores me.<br> Who wants to<br> know nowadays?<br> Our grenadiers are heroically<br> holding their positions.<br> Holding their positions.<br> It never changes.<br> Until one morning, you'll open the window<br> and they'll be there, the Amis.<br> - Hilde, will you please tell him to stop it.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I can't help it.<br> But he makes me cry.<br> This is an official<br> announcement of the Mnchen Kommandatur.<br> The enemy parachutist reported<br> yesterday near Altenmarkt is still at large.<br> He's believed to be<br> wearing Luftwaffe boots...<br> as his footprints near the buried<br> parachute have disclosed.<br> - Anything important?<br> - Uh, no, nothing important.<br> Well, Hilde,<br> I haven't seen you since Leipzig.<br> They certainly move<br> you people around.<br> Fritzi, this is Corporal-<br> Say, what is your name?<br> - Steiner. Karl Steiner.<br> - My name is Scholtz.<br> And this is Fritzi Kollwitz.<br> Everything's fine.<br> We have a room across the street...<br> and thanks to Fritzi,<br> plenty of food.<br> And now, what's most important.<br> How about something decent to drink?<br> It's not that easy anymore, Heinz, huh?<br> But I'll see what I can do.<br> We were lucky to run into<br> each other, weren't we, Karl?<br> You've got money,<br> and I know how to spend it.<br> Pardon me,<br> but if you still like to dance?<br> Oh. You're not as slow<br> as I thought.<br> I hope you don't think<br> you are doing me a favor.<br> I only changed my mind.<br> That's all.<br> But you better hurry up<br> or there won't be much left.<br> - Where'd you learn to dance?<br> - In a school, in Potsdam.<br> Haven't you danced since?<br> Come on, Corporal, I won't break.<br> - Is that better?<br> - Well, isn't it?<br> - Coming, Hilde?<br> - I'll be right there.<br> Pretty, huh? Lost her leg<br> a year ago in Breslau.<br> - Are you with a show?<br> - Yes. Soldaten Variete.<br> Well, it's still better<br> than the labor front, not much better.<br> Maybe I'm not what<br> you're looking for?<br> Maybe a sweet young man like you<br> would rather have someone your own age?<br> - Aren't you?<br> - Now don't be generous.<br> If you'd seen me<br> a couple of years ago-<br> Why in '42 in the summer, there<br> was an Italian major in Milano.<br> He wanted to marry me.<br> Here. Fritzi has found something special,<br> a real Steinhager. Eighty percent.<br> Just try it, Hilde.<br> Don't let anybody touch that.<br> - How about you?<br> - No, thank you.<br> What? Enjoy yourself<br> while you can, soldier.<br> It may not happen to us again.<br> We may all go, all at once, fast.<br> May I have one<br> of your cigarettes?<br> Well, even if we do,<br> we've had a good time, haven't we?<br> We've given the world 12 years<br> it will never forget.<br> And no matter what they do,<br> they'll never get us out of their system.<br> And now there'll be a little song<br> which was composed by our soldiers...<br> when they were<br> stationed in Paris.<br> We're the Boche again now.<br> But I remember Paris in '41,<br> that first summer. Do you know Paris, Karl?<br> - No. The only part of France<br> I've seen was Alsace.<br> - Alsace?<br> Yes. I was there with<br> my outfit a few months ago.<br> No true German<br> thinks of Alsace as a part of France.<br> It's as German as the Rhineland<br> or the Saar.<br> I only thought of it as France because I<br> remember we took it from the French.<br> We didn't take it. We took it back.<br> We took what belonged to us and maybe more.<br> - Well, we did it, and we'll do it again!<br> - Heinz. Heinz, please.<br> You're right, Fritzi.<br> You're right.<br> You see what a good influence<br> women are on men?<br> Hmm, sometimes, not always.<br> I think I'd better get some sleep.<br> I have to get up very early.<br> Sure, go ahead, Corporal. The woman<br> at the desk will show you to your room.<br> Not only did you forget<br> to say good-bye to me, Corporal...<br> but you also forgot<br> these things downstairs.<br> And, uh, and you left these<br> on the table.<br> Thank you.<br> You know, we haven't seen<br> this kind for quite a while.<br> A doctor gave them to me...<br> - in a hospital.<br> - Want one?<br> No. I'd like to get some sleep.<br> You want me to get out, is that it?<br> Yes, I do.<br> You don't like me.<br> Why don't you say so?<br> That has nothing<br> to do with it.<br> It's just that<br> I feel sorry for you.<br> Sorry for me?<br> Who do you think you are?<br> I've known better men than you<br> and they didn't turn their noses up at me.<br> But then I suppose they<br> weren't brought up like you.<br> Oh, I know your type. The little German<br> Brger, pure and honest.<br> You've been taught to keep your distance,<br> to keep your hands clean.<br> Well, you are as dirty<br> as the rest of us now.<br> Come on.<br> Get out of here.<br> And let me<br> tell you something.<br> I was in love once with a man who to me<br> was as decent as you think you are.<br> And what's more, he was in love with me.<br> But he was killed in Norway.<br> And when I bore his child,<br> his family turned away from me<br> as- as is if I were a stranger.<br> I got a job. Nothing to be proud of,<br> but it kept us alive.<br> And then one day<br> my child was killed.<br> There was a raid. And when I came home<br> after work that night...<br> there was nothing left<br> of the street where I lived.<br> I couldn't find her.<br> I never did.<br> From then on,<br> I didn't care what happened.<br> I just hated-<br> hated everybody.<br> But probably myself most of all.<br> Why? You want to know why?<br> Because I was hungry. Hungry for<br> a little kindness and- and love and-<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe it was all my fault.<br> Anyway here I am-<br> dirty, miserable and alone.<br> There are thousands<br> and thousands like me.<br> Well, now you know me.<br> Are you satisfied?<br> Here. Drink this. Go ahead.<br> I'm sorry. l-<br> I just couldn't help it.<br> What's the matter, dear?<br> Anything wrong?<br> Get out.<br> Get out, I said.<br> I thought you said you were tired.<br> There are thousands<br> and thousand like me.<br> We've given<br> the world 12 years it will never forget.<br> Do you know what you're getting into?<br> Hello.<br> Are you calling Dr. Maurer? Hello?<br> Your father<br> is at the base hospital in Wrzburg now.<br> Up on the Berg.<br> The hospital is next to the factory.<br> Your main objective<br> is to locate the 11 th Panzer Corps.<br> Say, Corporal Steiner.<br> Here is a message about your transportation.<br> You've got to report to the Marktplatz.<br> Thank you.<br> Could you help me, Corporal?<br> I have to talk to you.<br> It's shorter this way.<br> Will you follow me?<br> Look, it isn't any of my business<br> who you are or- or what you've done, but-<br> What are you talking about?<br> I know its hard to make you believe<br> I'm telling the truth.<br> But you must trust me. You must.<br> - What is it?<br> - Last night, you know<br> who sent me to your room?<br> It was Scholtz.<br> He ordered me to watch you.<br> Look out.<br> Thank you, Corporal, for helping me.<br> I can carry it myself.<br> Hey, Steiner, I'm afraid<br> I have to get back to Nuremburg.<br> But the truck over there<br> is going your way.<br> It's all fixed.<br> The driver knows all about you.<br> Sorry about last night. I had a couple<br> too many. Have a good trip.<br> All right.<br> Here, pass it around.<br> - Didn't you say it was Scholtz<br> who ordered you to watch me?<br> - Yes, it was.<br> Well, if he did,<br> why did you tell me about it?<br> I'm not quite sure why.<br> But last night, for the first time,<br> you made me realize what was happening to me.<br> - That I can't go on like this.<br> That there is some reason-<br> - All right.<br> Let's suppose you are telling the truth,<br> that Scholtz is suspicious of me.<br> That still doesn't prove he's right.<br> I don't care if he is right or not.<br> All I know is they're after you.<br> Look, Karl, I know these people.<br> I know them too well.<br> If you need money, here,<br> I have this ring. You can sell it.<br> Hilde, the Corporal here<br> said this may help keep you warm.<br> No, thank you.<br> Do you know that man over there?<br> - Which one?<br> - In the corner with the glasses on.<br> - Halt!<br> - No, I don't.<br> - Halt.!<br> - What's the matter, sir?<br> Everybody off.<br> Oh, I mean except the ladies.<br> Karl, be careful.<br> I didn't lie to you.<br> You think you can still see<br> what you're shooting at?<br> Yes, at your orders,<br> Herr Oberleutnant.<br> - All right, Sergeant, take them away.<br> - Left face. Forward, march.<br> Take the women to the village and have<br> the truck inspected by our ordinance.<br> Yes, sir.<br> All right, let's go.<br> Detail, halt.!<br> Left face!<br> - Eighteen more.<br> - Get all your papers out and stand by.<br> Twenty-seven all together,<br> Herr Oberleutnant.<br> All right, men.<br> You are about to be processed to see<br> which one of you will fulfill our needs here.<br> This is an emergency measure<br> taken by order of the commanding<br> general, 11 th Panzer Corps.<br> Those of you who will not be selected will<br> be allowed to proceed to your regular units.<br> At ease. Carry on, Klinger.<br> Say, isn't that a medic back there?<br> I'm talking to you, lancer.<br> Come on. You heard<br> the lieutenant. Move out.<br> Soldbuch.<br> Come on.<br> - What unit are you going to?<br> - The 20th Flak, sir. Attached<br> to the 16th Infantry Division.<br> - All right. Get him to the<br> colonel's quarters right away.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - What about my unit, sir?<br> - They'll have to get along<br> without you, I guess.<br> Come on. Follow me.<br> Leutnant Bulow said this man<br> is to report to Oberst Von Ecker.<br> - Oh, yes. Gutterman.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Take this man upstairs to Major Hartmann.<br> He knows all about it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Hartmann, give me his file.<br> - Here it is, sir.<br> The court-martial convened<br> upon my orders yesterday...<br> has found you guilty<br> of willful desertion...<br> and has therefore recommended<br> that the extreme penalty be imposed...<br> that you be hanged<br> by the neck until dead.<br> I can't see any reason why their<br> sentence shouldn't be carried out.<br> I beg you, sir. My wife and children<br> were bombed out.<br> I had to find a place for them<br> to keep them alive.<br> So you took it upon yourself<br> to stay with them and neglect your duty.<br> But that was my only mistake,<br> sir, after 20 years service.<br> Today, it's more than a mistake.<br> It's a crime.<br> You, Leerback, should know that better<br> than any of the others.<br> Yes, sir. But you can't let them<br> kill me for that.<br> I beg you, sir. Not just for myself,<br> but for my family, my children.<br> I'm sorry. In these times,<br> the discipline of our troops...<br> is more important than<br> our personal destinies.<br> - That's all, Leerback.<br> - Sir, I beg you to reconsider.<br> - I'll do anything. Anything you ask.<br> - Stop it.<br> You're supposed to be a soldier.<br> Act like one. Take him away.<br> Come with me.<br> Take your coat off.<br> - The medic is here, sir.<br> - All right.<br> The Luftwaffe is about the only uniform<br> we haven't collected here as yet.<br> At ease. Your name and unit?<br> Corporal Steiner, sir, 20th Flak.<br> I was on my way to Mannheim<br> to rejoin my unit.<br> There's a tray on the table<br> next to my bed. Bring it here, please.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Will you read the labels aloud?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> "Five ampules of digifolin,<br> one c.c. in case of emergency.<br> "Nitroglycerin tablets,<br> Alcohol." That's all, sir.<br> - You are a medic. Do you<br> know what this is for?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It's used in case of a severe attack<br> of angina pectoris. A heart disease, sir.<br> Pretty good. Well, then you know<br> what's wrong with me.<br> Unfortunately, I had to send my orderly<br> to Darmstadt to get more of this stuff.<br> As you see by the prescription,<br> it's important that in case of an attack...<br> the dose be exactly one c.c.<br> and be given immediately.<br> - An overdose or a delay can be fatal.<br> - Yes, sir. I can see that.<br> Well, that will be all<br> for the moment.<br> You better make yourself comfortable.<br> You will be here for a while.<br> Would Herr Oberst like me<br> to serve his dinner now?<br> I had hoped you wouldn't<br> remind me of it.<br> But I suppose a man has to eat,<br> even when he has no appetite.<br> - Put some blankets on the windows.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hartmann.<br> And there's a candle on my desk.<br> Bring it here, please.<br> - At your orders, Herr Oberst.<br> - About our forward echelon, have they left?<br> Two battalions of the 21 st<br> started for Mannheim an hour ago, sir.<br> - The Fifth will be starting in the morning.<br> - Fine.<br> Will you be sure to remind<br> the commanding officers...<br> that despite their being<br> in GeneralJaeger's area...<br> - they are still under my direct command.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And that they will not take orders<br> from anyone but me.<br> Yes, sir. I'm sorry to bother you, sir,<br> but about the deserter.<br> Have you signed the order<br> for his execution?<br> No, I have not.<br> Thank you, Hartmann.<br> - There's a bottle of<br> Niersteiner in the locker.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And there must be another glass<br> around here. There by the window.<br> I don't enjoy<br> drinking wine by myself.<br> I don't care for any,<br> unless Herr Oberst insists.<br> I do insist.<br> Furthermore, you needn't stand<br> at attention all the time.<br> And for heaven's sake,<br> stop addressing me in the third person.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Go ahead. Don't make me<br> repeat things.<br> Not bad.<br> Does Herr Oberst- Uh, do you<br> wish anything else, sir?<br> Nothing.<br> There's an extra blanket<br> on my bed.<br> You can go to sleep as soon<br> as you have cleared the table.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Corporal?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - I want to be awakened at 6:00.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Shall I clean your pistol before<br> I put it back into your holster, sir?<br> No, you put it next to my bed.<br> - I want it here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And, uh, by the way...<br> don't forget to remind me in the morning<br> to sign the order of the execution.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Here. I said you can take these blankets.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Shall I turn the lamp off?<br> - Just turn it down a little.<br> Are you there, Corporal?<br> Yes, sir. I'm here.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, sir.<br> Two battalions of the 21 st to Mannheim.<br> The Fifth starts in the morning.<br> You will be here for a while.<br> Get back here, Happy.<br> Get back here in five days.<br> In case of an attack...<br> an overdose or a delay can be fatal.<br> Please.<br> I beg you. l-<br> Please. Please.<br> - Is Herr Oberst awake?<br> - No, sir. I don't think so.<br> - Shh.<br> - Is he up?<br> No, sir.<br> He had a very bad night.<br> - What is it?<br> - It's me, sir. Hartmann.<br> - I have the morning report for you, sir.<br> - Give it to the corporal.<br> - I'll be ready for you in half an hour.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What time is it?<br> - A few minutes past 6:00, sir.<br> - Help me.<br> Hm. You know,<br> I had a dream.<br> I dreamt you were the deserter I sentenced<br> and that you wanted to shoot me.<br> I had forgotten that people<br> like that are too weak.<br> They would never have<br> the courage to kill...<br> even if it is<br> to save themselves.<br> Sometimes it takes<br> more courage not to kill.<br> I would have preferred you<br> I had not answered me in that way.<br> But you just saved my life,<br> whatever that's worth.<br> And so, instead of punishing you,<br> I would like to do something for you.<br> I would suggest that Herr Oberst<br> remain quiet and not exert himself, sir.<br> - The third person again, Corporal.<br> - I'm sorry, sir.<br> How about a week's leave at home, hmm?<br> Would that suit you?<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I have my duty at the front.<br> - There's only one thing, however.<br> - Yes. What is it?<br> Maybe it's foolish of me...<br> but if you would have mercy on the deserter<br> and put him in prison instead.<br> Corporal, your profession<br> is to save lives, even the unworthy.<br> Well, mine is to take it,<br> even the worthy.<br> I know that it is insane to claim that we<br> can throw back the enemy that surround us.<br> But in one hour, in front of the officers<br> of my division, I will claim just that.<br> I'll do so because it is my belief...<br> that at all costs<br> we must fight to the bitter end.<br> That is the reason why,<br> now more than ever...<br> I must maintain the discipline<br> of my division.<br> And that is the reason<br> why this man must die.<br> Adjutant.<br> Give me some wine. Those pills,<br> they always make me thirsty.<br> - Shall I bring you a glass of water, sir?<br> - I hate water.<br> This is Von Ecker.<br> The medic you sent me yesterday, Corporal-<br> Uh, what's your name again?<br> - Corporal Steiner, sir.<br> - Steiner. Corporal Steiner.<br> I want him forwarded on to his unit<br> by the first available transportation.<br> That's what you wanted, isn't it?<br> - Yes. Thank you, sir.<br> - All right.<br> To our country.<br> - Bridge is out.<br> - Get the men off the trucks, quick.!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Everybody off the trucks!<br> The bridge is out!<br> You'll have to cross on foot!<br> Come on! Everybody out!<br> Line up in column of threes!<br> - Hurry up.!<br> - Everybody out.! We'll cross on foot.!<br> Everybody off the trucks!<br> The bridge is out!<br> - We'll have to cross on foot!<br> - Come on! Everybody out!<br> Line up in column of threes!<br> Hurry up!<br> Everybody out.!<br> We cross on foot.!<br> Everybody out of the trucks.!<br> Drivers start as soon as you've unloaded.!<br> My glasses. I've lost my glasses.<br> l- I can't see without them.<br> - Get over there.<br> - Here they are.<br> Ah.<br> It was very kind of you<br> to help me.<br> Huh. My name is Brandenbacher.<br> Ernst Brandenbacher.<br> Most people call me Ernst.<br> It's easier.<br> - We'd better get going.<br> - We'll reload on the other side.<br> - Come on.! Hurry up.!<br> - Everybody remember<br> the number of the truck.!<br> - Reload on the other side.!<br> - Enemy planes.!<br> The Amis are coming.!<br> Take cover.! Quickly.! Cover.!<br> Help me, please!<br> Somebody! Help!<br> Ah. They got me!<br> But you won't get away, Steiner.<br> By now they know<br> all about you everywhere.<br> We could have taken you a long<br> time ago, but I hoped that you<br> would lead me to the others.<br> I hoped to get all of you.<br> The rest of the bridges,<br> were blown up this morning.<br> This seems to be<br> the last one in Mannheim.<br> I'll bet it won't be long<br> before this one goes too.<br> - I heard the Americans are in Landau.<br> - So what? Are you afraid?<br> Better get your papers out.<br> Here comes another spot check.<br> Spot check.<br> They better call it "grave registration."<br> Today they take your name.<br> Tomorrow they notify your mother.<br> - Oh, keep quiet.<br> - Gunther, Alois- Gefreiter.<br> - All right.<br> - Schaus, Herbert- Obergefreiter.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Bachschmidt, Hans- Kanonier.<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - Schmidt, Albert- Unteroffizier.<br> - All right.<br> - Rothmann, Klaus- Obergefreiter.<br> - Go on.<br> - Lachner, Gert-Schtze.<br> Myer, Billie-<br> Sturmfhrer.<br> Schindler, Johannes-<br> Pionier.<br> - All right.<br> - Soldbuch and travel orders.<br> I lost them in an air attack this morning.<br> I'm on my way to my unit in Neustadt.<br> You lost them and not a scratch on you,<br> huh? Take him back to the checkpoint.<br> - They'll find out<br> what happened to his papers.<br> - Yes, sir. Come on.<br> Call the Mannheim side. Ask them<br> if we should stop the traffic. Next.<br> Come on. Keep going.<br> Wait here.<br> You said they found<br> an American leaflet on you?<br> Yes. You'd think I committed<br> a crime, that I was-<br> - No talking!<br> - Here's the man.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Maurer, Karl.<br> - I was told you lost your papers, huh?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - You said your name is Karl Maurer?<br> - Yes, but that's just-<br> I know. I know. Get over there.<br> Keep an eye on him.<br> Come on. Get back.<br> Stop.!<br> Cut him off from the other side<br> of the railroad bridge.<br> The Mannheim<br> Central Kommandatur has just<br> received information...<br> that a man suspected of being<br> a dangerous enemy saboteur...<br> escaped a few hours ago from the Wehrmacht<br> control point at the main Rhine bridge.<br> He is wearing the uniform<br> of a corporal in the Luftwaffe.<br> He is about 20 years of age.<br> His appearance is slender,<br> average height, blonde, fair complexion.<br> As last seen, he wore a Red Cross arm band<br> on his left arm, a pistol belt and boots.<br> - He identifies himself as-<br> - Hey, soldier.!<br> What are you doing there?<br> Hey, we are talking to you.<br> - What's the matter,<br> are you deaf or something?<br> - Come on, let's see your papers.<br> - Halt!<br> - Halt!<br> Come on. Over here.<br> This way.<br> Where are the others?<br> They went around<br> the front of the building.<br> - Anyone there?<br> - He must be here somewhere.<br> Yes, I'm sure I saw him<br> running this way.<br> Lucky they didn't hit<br> this place during a show.<br> How about it?<br> He's not here.<br> - Go on! Keep looking!<br> - Hey, we better get out before<br> the whole place collapses.<br> Watch it. The floor's full ofholes.<br> - Hey, look what I found.<br> - Where?<br> - What is it?<br> - What happened?<br> - What are you doing there?<br> - Fritz found a string of pearls.<br> Looks like real stuff.<br> Remember, this used<br> to be a theater.<br> He's probably found Aida's<br> necklace or something.<br> - Here they come again.<br> - Let's get out of here, quick!<br> Well, go on. It's starting again.<br> Neckarstrasse.<br> Neckarstrasse.<br> Fraulein.<br> I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be out,<br> but my child got hurt by flying glass.<br> I have to get some iodine. Don't turn<br> me in, please. Here, I have money.<br> Here, some iodine and bandages.<br> You better get off the street now.<br> Believe me, it's only because of my child.<br> You're not going to turn me in, please.<br> You promise?<br> I promise. Don't be afraid.<br> Go ahead now.<br> God bless you.<br> Uh, just a moment.<br> I'm looking for Neckarstrasse 18.<br> - It's the second street to the right.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Tiger.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> I had to come.<br> They're after me.<br> They're after you?<br> And you lead them here, you idiot?<br> Nobody followed me,<br> I promise you.<br> - There is a message that<br> we must send right away.<br> - What is it?<br> - I found the location of the<br> - Where are they?<br> I want to see Lieutenant Rennick.<br> I'm not important enough<br> for you, huh?<br> Come on, let's hear it, Junge.<br> I said talk.<br> - Who is it, Tiger?<br> - We have a guest, Lieutenant.<br> Go ahead.<br> - I know I'm not supposed to come here,<br> but I spent last night-<br> - Get inside.<br> - Where did you get this address?<br> - I heard Tiger give it to you on the plane.<br> I was trying to get across the Rhine<br> when they nearly caught me.<br> - My name is on the blacklist.<br> - That helps a lot.<br> - Now why'd you come here?<br> - I have some very important<br> information to send.<br> - I knew you had the radio. That's why I came.<br> - I'm afraid you're too late.<br> We had a near miss.<br> The concussion damaged the transmitter.<br> - I haven't been able to make contact since.<br> - We will have to do something.<br> - You know what will happen<br> if he falls into their hands.<br> He's all right.<br> What's the word<br> from GeneralJaeger?<br> GeneralJaeger and two members of his staff<br> were gravely wounded this morning...<br> while on a routine inspection tour<br> of the front.<br> Here. You can read it yourself.<br> We tried to contact the general<br> at the hospital in Heidelberg where he is...<br> or is supposed to be.<br> - It was impossible.<br> - Impossible? Why?<br> The hospital is under heavy S.S. guards.<br> No one is allowed to enter<br> without special permission.<br> You mean to imply<br> the whole story may be a fake?<br> We have often encountered<br> worse fakes than this.<br> Well, what do you propose to do?<br> What about yourself and all the other officers?<br> You plan to carry out the agreement?<br> I am afraid without the general<br> we have no power over the troops.<br> It's too much of a risk.<br> A great many lives are at stake,<br> Germans as well as Americans.<br> Isn't it worth taking the risk?<br> I'm sorry, but I can't.<br> And I'm sure the others feel as I do.<br> The lives of our families and our friends<br> are involved. Besides, now it's all too late.<br> - We should have acted a long time ago.<br> - Yeah, but then it was too early.<br> You always wanted to get rid of them,<br> but were never willing to<br> take a chance or responsibility.<br> Why? Because you wanted to hang on<br> to your ranks, your titles, your jobs.<br> And today, when you could still save<br> the most important thing of all-your souls-<br> you haven't got the guts to do it.<br> They're right to call you traitors,<br> because you've betrayed yourselves.<br> There is only one way<br> I can answer you, Lieutenant.<br> It's all very easy for you to say,<br> but you were never in our shoes.<br> That's true.<br> And I hope we never will be.<br> Okay.<br> What are you going to do, Lieutenant?<br> Get out of here fast,<br> before one of the gentlemen starts to talk.<br> - I guess it's all right.<br> Nobody followed him.<br> Was the surrender planned<br> for this sector, Lieutenant?<br> Yeah. Why?<br> I spent last night at the headquarters<br> of the 11 th Panzer Corps.<br> Two of their regiments moved<br> into position this morning- here...<br> on both flanks<br> of GeneralJaeger's troops.<br> Looks like we're walkin' right into a trap.<br> We gotta get back, Tiger, as quick as we can.<br> But how can we make it, sir?<br> You heard him. He nearly got caught himself.<br> It must be the Rhine bridge.<br> - I saw them placing the charges.<br> - There goes our last chance.<br> - Is there any other way to get across?<br> - Sure, if you want to swim.<br> All right.<br> What's the best place to try it?<br> Swim? You're not serious.<br> Every inch of the shore is fortified.<br> Even if you get past Zement-<br> past your own artillery fire-<br> we'd freeze in the icy water.<br> Well, we can try.<br> One of us is sure to get through.<br> Well, if you're so brave,<br> why didn't you do it before?<br> Besides, how do we know<br> he didn't make the whole thing up?<br> How do we know he's telling the truth?<br> Maybe he's just trying-<br> Shut up.<br> Get the extra travel orders out<br> and the date stamp. Now go ahead, Happy.<br> I want you to brief us on every place<br> you've been, everything you've seen.<br> I have a sister-in-law<br> who lives on the third floor.<br> - From there we can get<br> a good view of the river.<br> - Okay. Go ahead.<br> This is it.<br> - My mother isn't here.<br> - That's all right.<br> We'll wait for her. Go ahead.<br> - You're Uncle Rudolph, aren't you?<br> - That's right.<br> My mother said<br> she'd be back in an hour.<br> But if you can't wait,<br> it's all right to go to Gottfried's house.<br> Thanks, Kurt.<br> If you are soldiers,<br> why aren't you at the front?<br> We just came from there, Junge.<br> We're on leave.<br> - Why doesn't my father get leave?<br> He hasn't been home for a year.<br> - We will talk about that later.<br> Right now I want you to wait<br> in there until your mother comes back.<br> This way.<br> What was that about Gottfried?<br> He's a friend of mine.<br> Lives about a mile from here.<br> I made arrangements with him<br> in case we need a place to stay over.<br> I thought we came here to decide<br> on the best spot to cross the river.<br> - I have made up my mind. I am not going.<br> - What?<br> Sure. It's all right for you to take<br> that kind of a chance. But me and him?<br> When it's all over,<br> our own people will spit in our faces.<br> And you?<br> You will say thank you and fly home.<br> Then why did you take this job?<br> Why did you join them in the first place?<br> Because I wanted to live a little better,<br> not to get killed.<br> And if you will be honest with yourself,<br> you did it for the same reason.<br> I did it because I wanted<br> to help my country.<br> - Ah.<br> - And now, more than ever, I'm<br> sure that what I did was right.<br> Well, isn't it noble ofhim?<br> Who are you fooling?<br> Do you think anybody will believe you?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I don't expect them to.<br> Besides, it isn't important.<br> - The important thing is what we believe in.<br> - Knock it off, both of ya.<br> I don't care why you did it.<br> You're in this now,<br> and neither of you is backing out.<br> You better get that through your head,<br> Tiger. You know too much to be left behind.<br> I didn't mean it that way.<br> He must have heard everything,<br> the little brat.<br> You look downstairs.<br> I'll see if he's hiding here.<br> You watch for him below.<br> I'll look around on this floor.<br> - You little swine!<br> - Ow! Let me- Ow! Let me-<br> - Let me go!<br> - Let him go.!<br> - Little swine!<br> You'll kill him! Let him go. Stop it!<br> Don't you see he's only a kid?<br> Let him go, I said.<br> Are you crazy? You'll-<br> Happy! Stop him, quick!<br> Too late! He's reporting us.<br> Hey, come on.<br> To the left. Didn't you see them?<br> They've gone in that direction.<br> They're comin' around<br> on this side.<br> Take cover over here!<br> Quick!<br> This way, sir.<br> Hey, Berger, Fritz,<br> take two men-<br> The rest come with me.<br> I saw them sir. I'm sure<br> they must be here. Three of them.<br> All right. All right, Junge. Hey, Berger,<br> take four men around the back.<br> We'll cover it from this side.<br> - And now you must stay here.<br> - But I want to go with you.<br> Stay here, I said.<br> - You men, over here. Fritz, take<br> a look at that tunnel there.<br> - Right away, sir.<br> You can hardly see anything.<br> Get all the ones on your left,<br> behind those bricks.<br> - There's nothing<br> in the courtyard, sir.<br> There's a staircase going down<br> to the cellar. Over here, Fritz.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Nothing. Nothing.<br> He probably made the whole thing up, Max,<br> right from the start.<br> I suppose you're right.<br> - Call your men. We'd better get out of here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All right, then. Everybody out this way.<br> - Hey, Berger, let's get going!<br> - Hey, Gerhardt,<br> get your men together.<br> - All men report to the vehicles.<br> Come on, Fritz.<br> Let's get out ofhere.<br> Hey, Richter,<br> tell them we can go.<br> All right. All right.<br> Keep goin'! I said, keep goin'!<br> See if you can<br> get over the side here.<br> Tiger, you'll go first.<br> Happy, you follow.<br> If it's too tough to get all the way across,<br> we make for the island.<br> What's the matter with you, Tiger?<br> Get ready!<br> Let's get outta here, quick!<br> Hey, what was that?<br> I saw something.<br> Hey, there's a man lying down here.<br> Run!<br> My legs- I can't move them. My le-<br> Hang on to me.<br> We'll try to make it to the island.<br> Get down.<br> - I had a cramp. I will be all right.<br> - Okay.<br> It looks like only couple<br> of hundred feet to the other shore.<br> - Think-Think you can make it?<br> - I will try. I'm sure I can-<br> All right.<br> Just take it easy for a minute.<br> In case something happens to me,<br> have you got everything straight?<br> I've got it all. Don't worry.<br> Do you remember<br> the Wrzburg target, sir?<br> - That... chemical plant<br> they moved in from East Prussia?<br> Is that very important?<br> - Do you think they will bomb it?<br> - Well, I hope so. Why?<br> I found out that my father was transferred...<br> - from the hospital in Berlin, and-just-<br> - And what?<br> He's stationed in Wrzburg now.<br> The hospital is next to the factory.<br> - Think you can make it now?<br> - I think I can.<br> Ready? Come on!<br> Hey, Krohner, take the second<br> and third platoon...<br> - and spread them out ten meters<br> apart along this side.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Victor, take over the first platoon.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You will remain over here. Everyone<br> watch out for any men or enemy crossing.<br> - As you ordered, sir.<br> - Hans, get the first platoon ready. Quick.<br> - Right away, sir.<br> - All men of second<br> and third platoon come with me.<br> We'll have to wait.<br> They'll put down one more strand.<br> If the cramp starts again,<br> hang on to my shirt.<br> - Halt.! Halt.! Who's there?<br> - Come on.! Come on.!<br> - Who's there? Come out at once, or we'll fire.<br> - Go ahead, Lieutenant.<br> I can't make it anyhow.<br> Stop firing!<br> - Stop firing.!<br> - Hold it! Hold it!<br> - Get him! Get him, quick!<br> - Hey, you, over there.!<br> Stop him. Don't let him get away.!<br> Who are you? What are you doing here?<br> Are you going to talk or not?<br> - Ten seconds<br> to make up your mind.<br> Hey, there's someone<br> moving out there.<br> Knock it off, you jerks! Knock it off!<br> - Hold your fire. Sounds like one of our guys.<br> - What's he doin' out there?<br> Beats me.<br> Just keep him covered.<br> Twenty-first and Fifth Panzer. That's right.<br> They moved into Mannheim yesterday.<br> One regiment along the southern<br> boundary near Neckaran...<br> other about three kilometers<br> north of there.<br> WM-1967 on<br> the Darmstadt-Mannheim sheet.<br> Okay? Yes, I'll send a detailed report<br> over within an hour. What?<br> Well, they must have been<br> asleep at the switch up there.<br> Well, anyway, it's good news.<br> All right. Bye. First Army beat us to it again.<br> They found a bridge the Germans forgot...<br> to blow at Remagen, and they're pouring<br> into Germany like an Army Day parade.<br> I'd be happy to give Berlin to the First,<br> if it'd get me home sooner.<br> - Good news, huh, Rennick?<br> - Hmm?<br> - Oh. Fine, sir.<br> - Got a cigarette, Pete?<br> Look, I know how you feel.<br> There isn't much you can do about it.<br> A kid like Happy,<br> even if he came through it alive...<br> a traitor's always a traitor,<br> no matter what his reasons are.<br> We didn't hesitate<br> about using him.<br> In a war, to save lives,<br> you use whoever you can.<br> Trouble is, you always lose the best ones,<br> 'cause the best ones<br> are willing to take a chance.<br> You better get some rest.<br> It'll do ya good.<br> - Siebert, get me Cadet Forward.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Come on, hero, straighten up.<br> You oughta be grateful you're alive.<br> Don't worry. I am.<br> - Cadet Forward?<br> Hold on just a minute, please.<br> Griffin-<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - You're staying on with the old man.<br> Take Lt. Rennick to the convent. All<br> kidding aside, Dick, take it easy for a while.<br> - I will, Pete.<br> - I'll see you later.<br> - Sure glad to have you back, Lieutenant.<br> - Thanks.<br> Hey, you better put this on. You're pretty<br> lucky, sir. Too bad about the kid.<br> - Huh?<br> - I mean Happy.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Well, I guess it's no good thinkin' about it.<br> After all, he was<br> just another Kraut.<br> A man stays alive<br> as long as he's remembered...<br> and is killed<br> only by forgetfulness.<br> So long, Happy.<br> Let your real name<br> remain unknown...<br> but let the memory of your sacrifice<br> serve as a key to the meanings of treason.<br> It was to me.<br>
