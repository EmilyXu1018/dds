We're listening.<br> Shit, all these people are related.<br> I'll be damned if I'll come back<br> and stand trial...<br> ...with this man's aunt and uncle...<br> ...maybe his mama and his daddy<br> sittin' in the jury box.<br> What do you think, Bobby?<br> How about you, Ed?<br> I don't know. I really don't know.<br> Now you listen, Lewis.<br> I don't know what you got in mind...<br> ...but if you conceal this body,<br> you'll be charged with murder.<br> That much law I do know.<br> This ain't one of your fuckin' games!<br> You killed somebody!<br> There he is!<br> I see him, Drew.<br> That's right, I killed somebody.<br> But you're wrong if you don't see this<br> as a game.<br> Now you listen, Ed!<br> Damn it, we can get out of this thing!<br> Without any questions asked!<br> We get connected up with that body<br> and the law...<br> ...this thing's gonna be hangin' over us<br> the rest of our lives.<br> We gotta get rid of that guy.<br> Just how are you gonna do that, Lewis?<br> Where?<br> Anywhere.<br> Everywhere.<br> Nowhere.<br> How do you know that other guy<br> hasn't already gone for the police?<br> What in the hell is<br> he gonna tell 'em, Drew?<br> What he did to Bobby?<br> Why couldn't he go get<br> some other mountain men?<br> Now why isn't he gonna do that?<br> You look around you, Lewis!<br> He could be out there anywhere,<br> watchin' us right now.<br> We ain't gonna be so goddamned<br> hard to follow, draggin' a corpse.<br> You let me worry about that, Drew.<br> You let me take care of that.<br> You know what's gonna be here?<br> Right here. A lake.<br> As far as you can see.<br> Hundreds of feet deep.<br> Hundreds of feet deep.<br> Did you ever look over a lake...<br> ...and think about somethin' buried<br> underneath it?<br> Buried underneath it!<br> Man, that's about as buried as you can get!<br> Well, I am telling you, Lewis,<br> I don't want any part of it.<br> Well, you are part of it!<br> It is a matter of the law!<br> The law?<br> The law?<br> What law?<br> Where's the law, Drew?<br> You believe in democracy, don't you?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Well, then, we'll take a vote.<br> I'll stand by it.<br> So will you.<br> What do you say, Bobby?<br> Let's bury him.<br> I don't want this gettin' around.<br> Okay?<br> Okay?<br> It's up to you, Ed.<br> It's all up to you, Ed.<br> Now just think what you're doin', Ed.<br> For God's sake.<br> You got a wife.<br> You got a child.<br> You're not involved in this.<br> Think about your family, Ed.<br> This may be the most important decision<br> of your whole life, Ed.<br> Yes!<br> There's no way we can change this.<br> There's no way we can change<br> what happened to Bobby.<br> We gotta do the right thing.<br> We must live with it for the rest<br> of our lives.<br> Right!<br> I'm with Lewis.<br> All right, let's get on with it, then.<br> Lewis. Let's go.<br> What's the plan, Lewis?<br> Plan?<br> We just paddle on down to Aintry,<br> get the cars and go home.<br> Put your jacket on, Drew.<br> Drew!<br> Put your life jacket on!<br> Drew, paddle! Drew!<br> Drew?<br> Drew, what's the matter?<br> Lewis, somethin's wrong. To the side.<br> Something's wrong!<br> No! Go on!<br> What is it?<br> Don't stop, Ed!<br> - I'm gonna pull in.<br> - Go!

Of course!<br> You mean that other guy shot him?<br> Did he?<br> Did you see him?<br> Drew was shot.<br> Lewis says that other guy...<br> ...that toothless bastard, shot him!<br> He's right up there!<br> He's gonna try and kill us, too!<br> If he killed Drew...<br> ...he's gonna have to kill us!<br> Lewis, I'll tell you what.<br> We'll wait until dark, and we'll put you<br> in the bottom of the canoe...<br> ...and we'll sneak out of here.<br> - Okay, Ed?<br> - Bobby, look at those rapids down there!<br> - Look at those rapids!<br> - Christ!<br> We can't move out of here in the dark.<br> We're not gonna move you, Lewis.<br> Lewis, we're trapped in this gorge.<br> What're we gonna do, Lewis?<br> You're the guy with the answers.<br> What the hell do we do now?<br> Now you get to play the game.<br> You're ruined! Lewis, you're ruined!<br> Listen.<br> He's hurt bad, isn't he?<br> What're we gonna do?<br> The guy must know exactly where we are.<br> Well, if he knows where we are...<br> ...then we sure as hell know<br> where he's gonna be.<br> Right up there.<br> Christ!<br> What a view!<br> Goddamn it!<br> You'll never get out of this gorge alive!<br> Goddamn it!<br> Pull yourself together.<br> Release.<br> I don't believe it!<br> You did it, Ed.<br> You killed him!<br> Good.<br> Lewis had a bad night.<br> More than once I thought he'd die.<br> You did it, Ed. Good.<br> You sure it's him?<br> That's the guy with the gun, huh?<br> I think so.<br> He wasn't just some guy...<br> ...up there huntin' or something?<br> - You tell me!<br> Was he shot?<br> What about here? What about right there?<br> Could have been a rock.<br> What are you gonna do with Drew?<br> If a bullet made this,<br> there are people who can tell.<br> Oh, God!<br> There's no end to it.<br> I didn't really know him.<br> Drew was...<br> ...a good husband...<br> ...to his wife Linda.<br> You're a wonderful father<br> to your boys, Drew...<br> ...Jimmy and Billy Ray.<br> And if...<br> ...we come through this, I promise...<br> ...to do all I can for 'em.<br> He was the best of us.<br> Amen.<br> Christ! Look at that! God help us.<br> We made it. We made it, Ed.<br> We made it.<br> - We're back, Ed!<br> - Yeah.<br> - We gotta get Lewis to a doctor.<br> - Right, Ed.<br> Gotta get Lewis to a doctor.<br> We're back! We made it!<br> Everything happened...<br> Listen, everything happened right here.<br> Everything happened right here.<br> Lewis broke his leg in those rapids there.<br> - And Drew drowned here. In this place.<br> - No, no, Ed.<br> - No, nothin' happened here.<br> - Bobby, listen to me!<br> We got to stop them from lookin' upriver.<br> It's important that we get together<br> on this thing.<br> You understand?<br> I understand, Eddie, I understand.<br> That's right, Lewis. That's our story.<br> Lewis, we're back.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Get Lewis to a doctor.<br> All right, Ed.<br> All right.<br> We'll find a place to put it.<br> We're not out of this yet!<br> They brought the cars.<br> You come for the cars, sir?<br> Yes.<br> Do you have a phone?<br> Phone?<br> Telephone?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You're gonna be all right.<br> What in the world happened to you guys?<br> Drew Ballinger.<br> Did you look for him?<br> A long time.<br> Could you show us where it happened?<br> How'd you manage to shoot yourself<br> with your own arrow?<br> Didn't think it could be done.<br> This is nice.<br> What's that?<br> Chromium, paper tissues...<br> ...hot water... That's nice.<br> You fallin' asleep?<br> Don't forget to phone your wife.<br> Let her know how you are.<br> Yes, I will, thank you.<br> Hello. Come on in.<br> We saved you a seat.<br> Do you feel like eating something?<br> Please.<br> Some corn?<br> Would you like some peas?<br> This corn is special, isn't it?<br> I love good corn.<br> We need that cucumber<br> I got out of the garden last night.<br> You know how long it was?<br> - Tell me.<br> - Twelve-and-a-half inches long.<br> Then I measured it around,<br> and it's ten-and-a-half around.<br> That's the darndest lookin' cucumber<br> you'll ever see.<br> I tell you, I'll send it over<br> and let you see it, if you doubt it.<br> I think you're crazy sometimes.<br> We can show you the place.<br> Now I know where you told me it was.<br> We just wanna cooperate.<br> You recognize that piece of canoe?<br> Now, we lost one. That could be it.<br> But you ain't sure?<br> Yeah, I think so, but it's kind of confusing.<br> I'd think you'd recognize your own canoe.<br> I'd appreciate it if you'd show me<br> that spot.<br> Ed, we're in trouble. They don't believe us!<br> What did you tell him, Bobby?<br> What we agreed on.<br> I heard you. I was in that room, Bobby.<br> What did you tell him?<br> They found part of the green canoe, right?<br> Upstream, and you got scared.<br> Didn't you, Bobby? I know you.<br> You told him the truth, didn't you, Bobby?<br> - You told him the truth!<br> - I didn't do that!<br> I told 'em...<br> ...like we said.<br> But I don't think they believed me.<br> Ed, I think they found that other canoe...<br> ...upstream, above where we told him.<br> I never said that.<br> Yes, you did.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - I know damn well you did.<br> I know what I said.<br> Yeah, well, that's a goddamn lie.<br> Sheriff, that ain't what he said<br> this morning.<br> You tell me how a canoe can drift upriver.<br> Now what about this?<br> Look, Sheriff...<br> ...we been through quite a lot.<br> I don't know what's wrong<br> with your man there.<br> Mr. Queen's got a brother-in-law...<br> ...back up in there somewhere.<br> He took off huntin' three days ago and...<br> ...nobody's heard from him since.<br> Mr. Queen thought maybe you all...<br> ...might've happened up on him<br> somewhere.<br> Well, we didn't.<br> Don't let 'em go. These boys is lying.<br> We got nothin' to hold 'em for.<br> We don't have a thing.<br> Let's just wait and see<br> what comes out of the river.<br> That there's the town hall.<br> Right over there's the old fire station.<br> Played a lot of checkers over there.<br> All this land's gonna be covered<br> with water.<br> Best thing that ever happened<br> to this town.<br> We may have to stop just a minute<br> for the church to get out of the way.<br> Christ.<br> Doctor, how's our boy?<br> We're doin' everything we can for him.<br> But there's a chance he might lose the leg,<br> so take it easy on him, okay?<br> I'll talk with you later.<br> Officer?<br> Has he been awake yet?<br> No, we're still waitin' for him<br> to come around.<br> Lewis, listen, we had to change our story.<br> How you feeling?<br> Never better.<br> Did you hear me?<br> What happened on that last set of rapids?<br> I don't remember nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> - Want me to drive Drew's car back?<br> - No.<br> Talk to his wife?<br> I'll do it, Bobby, thank you.<br> You all about ready to leave?<br> Yeah.<br> The Griner boys brought these cars<br> down to you from Orie, is that right?<br> Right.<br> You happen to see another man<br> with 'em up there?<br> There was someone, wasn't there?<br> I think so, yes.<br> Before you go, buddy,<br> let me ask you something.<br> How come you all ended up<br> with four life jackets?<br> Didn't we have an extra one?<br> No.<br> Drew wasn't wearin' his.<br> Well, how come he wasn't wearin' it?<br> I don't know.<br> Don't ever do nothin' like this again.<br> Don't come back up here.<br> You don't have to worry<br> about that, Sheriff.<br> I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful.<br> I hope Deputy Queen<br> finds his brother-in-law.<br> He'll come in drunk probably.<br> Good-bye, Ed.<br> 'Bye, Bobby.<br> I don't think I'll see you for a while.<br> Hey, Charlie.<br> What you got there, guy?<br> What's the matter?<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> Go to sleep.<br> Go to sleep.<br> SOFTITLER<br>
