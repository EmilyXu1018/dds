                        - Come on.<br> - No.<br> I'm not gonna hurt you.<br> Hurry it up,<br> and don't keep the wagon waiting.<br> - Right.<br> - Hey, hold it for this. I got to get home.<br> I got a home too. Book her with my relief.<br> That's the last wagon. I'm on my own time.<br> I don't want to get stuck here<br> till night court.<br> Tough.<br> I really don't want to inconvenience you.<br> I'll come back tomorrow.<br> Come on.<br> - Will they shave my head?<br> - You won't even have to take a bath.<br> Stand over there, against that chart.<br> - It smells like what?<br> - What were you doing in that crowd?<br> - All right. Give me the address.<br> - Looking for a fat wallet?<br> No, just standing.<br> We'll look into it.<br> Sorry to keep you waiting.<br> Does he play it loud?<br> Well, then, what's your complaint?<br> But you can't kill a man<br> for playing the same song.<br> - Even day and night.<br> - Five foot three.<br> I'm sorry, we can't help.<br> What was the price of this purse you lifted?<br> $6.<br> Times I've spent twice as much<br> for a pocketbook.<br> - I don't know why. It was crazy.<br> - Well, you took it.<br> I didn't need it. I didn't even like it. Crazy.<br> Take it easy, girlie.<br> I'm not going to hurt you.<br> Let me do the work. Just supply the finger.<br> Officer. Officer.<br> Mrs. Farragut.<br> Are those people still bothering you?<br> Worse than ever, Officer.<br> Why haven't you given me protection?<br> But I have 12 men guarding you,<br> one of them my own brother.<br> I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.<br> Atom bombs, that's what they're<br> making, those foreigners next door.<br> And they blow this atomic vapor<br> right through the wall at me.<br> And they have a man watching me, from<br> the top of the Empire State Building...<br> with radar.<br> - Well, that man we have covered.<br> - Does the President know about this?<br> I talked to him just an hour ago.<br> I'll tell you what. I'm going to double<br> the guard around you.<br> Thank you.<br> You couldn't come yourself, could you?<br> Well, no, I've got to keep in touch<br> with the President.<br> Well, of course. Goodbye.<br> Thank you so very much, thank you.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Thank you.<br> And every year, she sends me<br> tickets to the flower show.<br> Okay, girlie, wash your hands. In there.<br> Right over there.<br> - A story in that?<br> - No, it's just a slob.<br> Murder, they got me down for Sunday<br> again. What am I, a Sunday detective?<br> My kids will grow up<br> and won't even know me.<br> There isn't any lock on the door.<br> Just wash your hands, girlie.<br> We're due, boys, it's too quiet around here.<br> We're overdue for a nice, juicy homicide.<br> Not till I'm off duty.<br> Can't you keep your big mouth shut?<br> What can I do for you, sir?<br> My name is Sims. Endicott Sims.<br> I'm an attorney.<br> - I want to see the Lieutenant.<br> - What about?<br> I represent Karl Schneider.<br> Your office has a warrant out for him.<br> Schneider, that's McLeod's case.<br> You'll have to see him about it.<br> - I asked to see the Lieutenant.<br> - Just a minute.<br> Water's coming through the ceiling?<br> That's a civil action, lady. Call a lawyer.<br> There's a mouthpiece<br> by the name of Sims outside.<br> - Karl Schneider is his client.<br> - Schneider? Tell him to see McLeod.<br> - He asked to see you.<br> - All right, send him in.<br> Come in, please.<br> He's in back.<br> I'm sorry, Lieutenant,<br> I'll wait here in your office.<br> It's okay. What about Schneider,<br> Counselor? Where is he?<br> He's ready to surrender himself<br> to your personal custody.<br> My custody? He's McLeod's squeal.<br> Each man handles his own case<br> around here.<br> I don't want my client to have<br> any contact with Detective McLeod.<br> Why?<br> Because I don't want any rubber hose<br> used on him.<br> Counselor, how long have you been<br> practicing law?<br> We don't assault our prisoners.<br> My client is not frightened of McLeod<br> for nothing.<br> What frightens your client<br> is McLeod's record for convictions.<br> He never gives up on a case.<br> That's what frightens your client.<br> When can I see McLeod?<br> He's due any time now.<br> You can wait in my office.<br> Thank you.<br> - So?<br> - So what?<br> So, what happens to me now?<br> You wait here till night court opens.<br> - My brother-in-law's a lawyer.<br> - You're allowed three calls. Call him.<br> Gee, I hate to, because he's a kind of<br> a new brother-in-law...<br> and if my sister finds out, she'll die...<br> She's in the fourth month, too.<br> Suit yourself.<br> The court will appoint you one.<br> - Gee, I don't know what to do.<br> - Sit down.<br> When McLeod gets here,<br> tell him I want to see him.<br> Yes, sir.<br> A booster.<br> - Hi, Phil.<br> - Hello, Jim.<br> - Jim!<br> - Mary.<br> Phil, hang onto buster for a minute,<br> will you?<br> - What?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> Well, I came to file<br> a missing-husband report.<br> - How long has he been missing?<br> - Two days.<br> Well, young lady,<br> let's see what we can do for you.<br> Hey, Sam.<br> - Where to, Jim?<br> - Follow that car.<br> Why, that's Dakis' car. He's inside.<br> He ain't going nowhere.<br> Don't let him out of your sight.<br> Okay.<br> You look tired, Jim.<br> I've been up all night in a cheap<br> hotel room, waiting to catch a thief.<br> I might as well have stayed up with you.<br> I can't sleep when you're not home.<br> I hate to leave you alone, baby.<br> Did you see the doctor?<br> Yes.<br> - What'd he say?<br> - Same as last time.<br> Look, baby,<br> we're going to have a boy and a girl...<br> if we have to upset<br> the whole medical profession.<br> - All right, if you say so.<br> - I say so.<br> And tonight,<br> I'm going to take you out to dinner.<br> - It's a date.<br> - We'll celebrate.<br> - Celebrate what?<br> - Us. You and me.<br> I love you, Mary.<br> Look, I got to go now. You go on home,<br> I'll meet you there in an hour.<br> Sam, got a fare for you. One hour, baby.<br> Come on, buster.<br> Hi, McLeod. Got something for me?<br> Here's your story. He stole $480.<br> Tell the man, Arthur.<br> A regular Jesse James.<br> Who'd he steal it from, his mother?<br> - Don't belittle Arthur.<br> - Is the story worth a picture?<br> He's not ripe yet.<br> Wait for his second offence.<br> Don't try running for it, buster.<br> You'd just about reach that railing...<br> and suddenly you'd put on weight.<br> Bullets are supersonic.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - I won't, either way. Empty your pockets.<br> What did you do with the money, Arthur?<br> - Spent it.<br> - All of it?<br> - Yes.<br> - Turn them inside out.<br> - When were you at the Stork Club?<br> - Wednesday night.<br> You really make the rounds.<br> The hot-spot kid.<br> - Where'd you spend last night?<br> - In my room.<br> I was there.<br> Where were you, under the bed?<br> - I sat in the park.<br> - All night?<br> - Yes.<br> - It rained.<br> - So it rained. I didn't notice.<br> - Sit down. Roll up your sleeves.<br> Any identifying marks? Any scars?<br> J-O-Y. Who's Joy?<br> - A girl.<br> - Your girl?<br> - No.<br> - Whose girl?<br> What difference does it make?<br> I stole the money, I admit it.<br> Here's Joy again. Joy Carmichael.<br> Plaza Five...<br> Why drag her into this?<br> She doesn't know anything about it.<br> You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Arthur?<br> - Why should I lie?<br> - I don't know. Why should you steal?<br> Is this Joy Carmichael? Her sister?<br> Well, you ask Joy to come down to the<br> Her boyfriend, Arthur Kindred,<br> has been arrested.<br> Just have her ask for Detective McLeod.<br> McLeod?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Come in here.<br> Hey, Red...<br> This is Detective McLeod, Mr. Sims.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - He's an attorney.<br> - And very clever. I've seen him in court.<br> He represents Karl Schneider.<br> I had the pleasure<br> of arresting your client a year ago.<br> So I'm informed.<br> He's changed his lawyer since,<br> if not his business.<br> Mr. Schneider is a retired doctor.<br> He has a farm in New Jersey.<br> With a little sideline in New York.<br> A very profitable one.<br> Where's your boy?<br> He's ready to surrender himself<br> on the warrant you had issued.<br> Fine. Bring him in.<br> Before I do, I have here some photographs.<br> Now, these were taken only an hour ago.<br> Nudes? Ugly, isn't he?<br> - Well, he's no Mr. America.<br> - No, that he's not.<br> Now, you'll observe, there are<br> no bruises or lacerations of any kind.<br> This is the way<br> I'm delivering my client to you...<br> and this the way I want him back.<br> I should think that any change<br> whatsoever would be an improvement.<br> And I want you to know,<br> I'm not going to allow you...<br> to violate his constitutional rights.<br> You're not to abuse him physically...<br> nor degrade his dignity<br> as a human being. Do you understand?<br> I saw one of your client's patients last<br> year, in the morgue, on a marble slab.<br> Wasn't much human left of her,<br> and very little dignity.<br> My client was innocent of that charge.<br> The court acquitted him.<br> Insufficient evidence. But he was guilty.<br> What are you going to do,<br> try the case here? Save it for the judge.<br> For over a year, McLeod, you,<br> personally, have been making...<br> my client's life a living nightmare. Why?<br> Because I'm annoyed by criminals that<br> get away with murder. They upset me.<br> - That's your story.<br> - Yeah.<br> I've investigated and discovered otherwise.<br> - What are you driving at, Sims?<br> - What?<br> Nothing, yet.<br> I vouch for every man on my squad,<br> and that goes for McLeod.<br> If you've got something to say, say it.<br> When it serves my purpose, not before.<br> Meanwhile, Lieutenant, I'm warning you:<br> Not a hand on my client.<br> What's he driving at?<br> - A fishing expedition.<br> - Not without bait.<br> He hinted you're after Schneider<br> for personal reasons.<br> The Anderson girl is lying in the hospital.<br> Last year, a girl who trusted him died<br> when her baby was born.<br> What happened to her baby,<br> and lots of others, nobody knows.<br> That's why I take a personal interest<br> in Schneider.<br> This is an impersonal business, McLeod.<br> - How many times...<br> - He's a butcher and a murderer.<br> You ought to visit his farm.<br> Especially the kitchen.<br> It looks like a place<br> where they slaughter chickens.<br> Your moral indignation is beginning<br> to give me a quick pain in the neck.<br> I don't like lawyers<br> coming in here with photos.<br> It marks my squad lousy. I don't like it,<br> and I won't have it. You understand?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Can't you say, "Yes, sir"<br> without making it sound like an insult?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You're getting too superior, McLeod.<br> A one-man army against crime.<br> What's eating you?<br> I hate criminals.<br> I don't believe in coddling them.<br> - Who tells you to?<br> - You do, the whole system does.<br> What do you want to do,<br> put Schneider on a rack?<br> No. I want to put him in the electric chair...<br> where he belongs,<br> and pull the switch myself.<br> Sometimes, McLeod, you talk like a maniac.<br> You want to be judge and jury, too?<br> Well, you can't do it!<br> All right. Look, suppose you look after<br> Schneider yourself...<br> when he surrenders, huh?<br> Make sure he's comfortable,<br> that he gets everything he wants.<br> I'm taking my wife out to dinner tonight,<br> and I'm going to sleep late tomorrow.<br> That's fine. Wrap up your squeals<br> for today and get out of here.<br> - I don't want to see you for 24 hours.<br> - You won't. Mind if I shave?<br> You got to have the last word, don't you?<br> A man after me own heart.<br> - Hi, Lou.<br> - Hi, Joe.<br> Here you are, girlie.<br> - How much do I owe you?<br> - It's on the house.<br> That's very decent of you.<br> I mean it, very decent.<br> Well, you didn't kill anybody.<br> Embezzlement. Chicken feed.<br> - Here you are, kid.<br> - I don't want it.<br> Look, son, the city don't care<br> if you go hungry here.<br> We chip in for this stuff ourselves.<br> What branch of the service were you in?<br> Navy.<br> - Where'd you serve?<br> - The Marshals, Marianas, Iwo Jima.<br> My kid was in the Navy, too.<br> Juneau. You know her?<br> - She was a cruiser.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Didn't she go down with all hands?<br> - There were 10 survivors.<br> Rough deal.<br> He'd have been just about your age.<br> - How'd you get into this mess?<br> - Are you going to give me a sermon?<br> Don't get funny with me, son,<br> I'll knock you right through the floor.<br> Now, how'd you get into this mess?<br> - Hi, Lou.<br> - Hi, Jim.<br> Here comes trouble.<br> - What have you got there?<br> - Burglars. Caught them red-handed.<br> I went into my apartment,<br> and there they were all inside.<br> I tried to run away, but he grabbed me<br> by the neck and tried to choke me.<br> It's a lie. It's a pack of lies.<br> I heard her scream. They come running<br> down the stairs and I collared them.<br> This one gave me a struggle.<br> I'm walking down the stairs.<br> I'm minding my own business.<br> The cop jumps on top of me,<br> and starts beating my brains in.<br> All right. We'll come to you.<br> - Think I'm crazy? Do a thing like this?<br> - Sit down.<br> On this one, we found this. And this jimmy.<br> -.22?<br> - Loaded.<br> - What's your name. Stand up.<br> - Gennini. Charles Gennini.<br> And I don't know nothing.<br> I don't even know this guy.<br> Ask him. Hey, do I know you? No.<br> Take easy, Charley. Sit down.<br> What's your name?<br> - Lewis Abbott.<br> - Were you carrying these, Lewis?<br> Yeah.<br> He grabbed me by the throat. How can<br> a thing like this happen in New York?<br> - You're all right, now, madam.<br> - Now, you.<br> I got nothing to do with this.<br> What do you think? I got rocks in my head?<br> Look at this.<br> Quite a bundle. How much is here, Charley?<br> $1,400.<br> Eleven. Why is it, every time<br> we drag in one of you bums...<br> you've got $1,400 in your kick,<br> I got $11 in mine?<br> You don't live right.<br> How did you get this, Charley?<br> - I saved it. I worked.<br> - Where?<br> I was a bricklayer.<br> Count it. This goes to property clerk.<br> We don't want Charley suing us.<br> He was a bricklayer.<br> Let's see your hands.<br> The only thing you ever laid was a $2 bet.<br> When were you in stir last, Charley?<br> Me? Jail? Never.<br> I swear on a stack of Bibles.<br> What's your 'B' number?<br> On my mother's grave,<br> I ain't got no 'B' card.<br> How do you know what a 'B' card is,<br> if you never had one?<br> - I heard. I been around.<br> - I'll bet you have.<br> You've been working this precinct<br> all summer.<br> - No, I swear.<br> - Who do you think you're kidding?<br> I know that face.

Next time,<br> get yourself arrested before 4:00.<br> Let a guy eat a home-cooked meal.<br> - I'm sorry...<br> - You realize this is all on my own time?<br> Look at all these forms I had to type up.<br> And when I get to court,<br> the judge will probably let you off.<br> I won't even get a conviction.<br> Yeah, you caused me all this work<br> for nothing.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - All right, go wash your hands.<br> - That's a big help.<br> In there.<br> Yes. She doesn't answer? You sure?<br> No, I'll call back later.<br> Yes, sir?<br> My name is Pritchett. Albert R. Pritchett.<br> Come in, Mr. Pritchett.<br> We've been expecting you.<br> - Did you get my money back?<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - What did he do with it?<br> - Women, plush saloons...<br> Cabarets? I wouldn't have thought it.<br> He seemed such an honest boy.<br> - You'll prefer charges?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - We can count on you?<br> - When I make my mind up, I'm like iron.<br> - Fine. Thank you, Mr. Pritchett.<br> - Like iron.<br> - Arthur. On your feet. Is this the boy?<br> - Yes, I'm afraid it is.<br> Excuse me.<br> Arthur, why did you steal from me?<br> - Did I treat you badly?<br> - No, Mr. Pritchett.<br> - Did I pay you a decent salary?<br> - Yes.<br> Then why did you do this to me?<br> I built up my business<br> from a hole in the wall.<br> I worked darned hard for it,<br> and I want my money back.<br> - And you'll get it. I promise you.<br> - Susan.<br> The bank was closed. All I could scrape<br> together tonight was $120.<br> - I'll have the rest tomorrow.<br> - Take that back.<br> - Let me alone. Don't interfere...<br> - Who are you, miss?<br> I'm Susan Carmichael.<br> I'm an old friend of Arthur's family.<br> I'd like to straighten this out<br> with you, Mister...<br> - Pritchett. Albert R. Pritchett.<br> - How do you do, Mr. Pritchett?<br> How do you do?<br> You say you're prepared to return<br> the rest of my money?<br> Yes, I'll sign a promissory note,<br> or whatever you say.<br> Say, where'd you get that cash,<br> Miss Carmichael?<br> I had some, and I pawned<br> some jewelry. Here are the tickets.<br> - Do you want to see them?<br> - lf you don't mind.<br> - Anything of your sister's here?<br> - No.<br> - Is this the young lady...<br> - No. She doesn't know anything about it.<br> I know all there is to know.<br> Shall I make out a note for the rest?<br> Wait a minute.<br> We don't run a collection agency here.<br> This man's a thief. We're here to<br> prosecute criminals, not collect money.<br> He's not a criminal.<br> Miss Carmichael, you seem like<br> a very nice young lady...<br> I'm going to give you some advice.<br> I've seen a thousand like him.<br> You take your money and run.<br> - McLeod.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Get me the files on the Cottsworth squeal.<br> - Cottsworth? 1941?<br> - Yeah.<br> That'll be buried under a pile upstairs.<br> I'll have to dig them up.<br> Dig them up. Do it now.<br> Yes, sir.<br> He spells one thing for you:<br> Misery the rest of your life.<br> - He's no good. Believe me, I know.<br> - That isn't true!<br> Mr. Pritchett, he never did anything<br> dishonest before in his life.<br> Then why did he do it?<br> - He had a good job. He wasn't hungry.<br> - I was.<br> What?<br> You can be hungry for other things<br> besides food.<br> You were very decent to me, Mr. Pritchett.<br> You trusted me and I let you down.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Why did you do it, Arthur?<br> It's hard to explain, even to myself.<br> I'd been separated from my girl<br> for five years...<br> and she'd moved into a new world,<br> way out of my reach.<br> To take her out for the evening<br> cost two weeks of my salary.<br> Late collections had come in,<br> your money was in my pocket.<br> I didn't care about anything<br> except holding on to her.<br> It was my last chance. I lost anyway.<br> - You admit you did wrong?<br> - Of course I do.<br> - You're willing to make restitution?<br> - Tomorrow morning, I promise.<br> Mr. Pritchett,<br> this kid took a lot of chances for us.<br> Don't you think<br> we ought to take one for him?<br> You know, it's funny you should say that.<br> I was talking to my brother-in-law<br> just the other night, about my nephew.<br> I made exactly that point.<br> I was saying that the...<br> Yes, and you were right, Mr. Pritchett.<br> Arthur, wait outside.<br> Sit down, Mr. Pritchett.<br> Now, I can see you're a man<br> who knows his own mind, Mr. Pritchett.<br> This way, please.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. McLeod?<br> - What's this about, Lieutenant?<br> Have a seat.<br> - Where's my husband?<br> - He'll be here in a few minutes.<br> - He hasn't been hurt?<br> - No.<br> - I had a terrible feeling that he...<br> - Nothing like that. He's all right.<br> You're sure?<br> You're not trying to break it easy?<br> You'll see him in a few minutes,<br> I give you my word. Please, sit down.<br> Then, what is it? What's wrong?<br> A prisoner here was assaulted<br> by your husband.<br> - Jim wouldn't do that.<br> - He did.<br> This could be very serious, Mrs. McLeod.<br> This could cost your husband his job.<br> He could even wind up in jail.<br> Well, is there anything I can do to help?<br> Yes, by answering some questions,<br> by telling me the truth.<br> - Willing to go along?<br> - Yes, of course I am.<br> Did you ever run into a man named<br> Karl Schneider?<br> No.<br> - My cigar bothering you?<br> - No.<br> Did you ever hear your husband<br> mention that name?<br> Jim made it a rule<br> never to discuss his work with me.<br> It took me 10 years to train my wife.<br> It's a tough life, being married to a cop.<br> I don't think so. I'm happy.<br> - You love your husband?<br> - Very much.<br> When'd you leave Highland Falls?<br> The spring of 1941.<br> I got a job in a defense plant.<br> - Where?<br> - In Newark.<br> This doctor was practicing in Newark<br> about that time.<br> - Doctor?<br> - Schneider.<br> - Oh, he's a doctor?<br> - Yeah.<br> You never ran into him<br> around Newark, maybe?<br> - No, I don't know him.<br> - He knows you.<br> - What makes you think that?<br> - He said so.<br> I'm afraid he's mistaken.<br> He was positive. Karl Schneider.<br> Ring any bells?<br> No... I'm afraid not.<br> You looked away then. Why?<br> Did I? I wasn't conscious of it.<br> Are you sure a Dr. Schneider<br> never treated you?<br> Certainly not. I just told you no.<br> Why are you so indignant?<br> I didn't say what he treated you for.<br> Come in.<br> Mrs. McLeod, I'm going to have<br> to ask you a very personal question.<br> Did you ever have a child?<br> You know Jim and I have no children.<br> I mean, before you were married to Jim.<br> I was never married to anyone but Jim.<br> I know that.<br> Then how can you ask?<br> Mrs. McLeod,<br> my job is to find out the truth.<br> Please answer that question.<br> You have no right to ask that.<br> I have a right to get at the truth.<br> Did you ever have a baby?<br> No, Lieutenant Monaghan, I did not.<br> Does this name mean anything to you?<br> Tami Giacoppetti?<br> No.<br> Hello, Mary.<br> What is this, Lieutenant?<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. McLeod.<br> Come, rest a while.<br> Lying on the sidewalk, huh?<br> Man or woman? Where, please?<br> isn't that on the north side of the street?<br> Well, that's the 16th Precinct. Call them.<br> Any report on Schneider yet?<br> No, not yet.<br> Say, Jim...<br> I just had a long talk with Mr. Pritchett,<br> and he's willing to drop the charges.<br> He is? What's this about, Mr. Pritchett?<br> - I'd like to give the boy another chance.<br> - To steal from someone else?<br> Well, I wouldn't want this<br> on my conscience.<br> Suppose he commits a worse crime?<br> What about your conscience then,<br> Mr. Pritchett?<br> I'll gamble. I'm a gambler. I bet on horses.<br> This once I'll bet on a human being.<br> You stick to horses.<br> The percentage is better.<br> Now, just a minute, Jim.<br> I advised Mr. Pritchett to do this.<br> You had no right to do that, Lou.<br> This is my case. You know better.<br> I didn't think you'd mind.<br> - Well, I do.<br> - Well, I'm sorry.<br> But you said<br> that everything would be all right.<br> I made a mistake. It's his case.<br> The disposition of it is up to him.<br> Well, everybody concerned is...<br> I'm sorry, girlie,<br> you've got to leave me out of this.<br> It's his case, take it up with him.<br> Mr. McLeod, I'm going to<br> return the money, and if Mr. Pritchett...<br> Young lady, this isn't a civil case,<br> this a criminal action.<br> Jim, take a look at this sheet on Charley.<br> One second, Mr. Pritchett.<br> - So you didn't done it, Charley?<br> - No.<br> - No, on my mother's grave.<br> - And you've never been in jail?<br> May I drop dead.<br> What do you guys want from me?<br> Heart-breaking, isn't it?<br> These are your fingerprints, Charley.<br> They never lie.<br> Burglary, eight arrests, two assaults,<br> three muggings, one rape...<br> two homicides, five extortions,<br> one prison break.<br> Nice little sheet, Charley.<br> He's a four-time loser.<br> If he makes one false move,<br> hit him over the head.<br> Book him and bring him back here<br> for the inspector.<br> And book that bum, too.<br> You got a cigarette?<br> What do you want, room service?<br> It's the green-light hotel, ain't it?<br> Take him away.<br> Sure, they laugh, they cry.<br> But don't think it's your laughter<br> or your tears. It isn't.<br> They're a different breed.<br> Believe me, I know.<br> Who are you? God?<br> Didn't you ever make a mistake?<br> Yes.<br> When I was new on this job, we brought<br> in two boys caught stealing from a car.<br> They looked like babies. They cried.<br> I let them go.<br> Two nights later, two nights, one<br> of them held up a butcher in Harlem.<br> Shot him through the head and killed him.<br> Yes, I made a mistake,<br> and I'm not going to make it again.<br> But, Officer, you...<br> Young lady, I don't want<br> to discuss this with you.<br> - Don't talk to her like that.<br> - Shut up. Sit down.<br> When you're dealing<br> with the criminal mind, Mr. Pritchett...<br> softness is dangerous.<br> But if it's a first offence...<br> It's never a first offence,<br> it's just the first time they get caught.<br> Why are you so vicious?<br> I'm not vicious, young lady.<br> I didn't steal this man's money. He did.<br> Look, this is a war, Mr. Pritchett.<br> We're your army.<br> We're here to protect you.<br> But you civilians are too lazy,<br> or selfish or scared...<br> or just too indifferent<br> to even want to appear in court...<br> and see the charges through<br> that you, yourselves, bring.<br> But if I get paid...<br> I don't care about that.<br> This is a criminal action.<br> Are you or aren't you going through with it?<br> Because I'm not going to let him go.<br> If I don't bring charges?<br> Then I'll book him, anyway,<br> and subpoena you into court.<br> It's my duty to protect you,<br> in spite of yourself.<br> I guess I've got to leave it up to you,<br> Officer. Whatever you say.<br> I say prosecute.<br> All right, you know best.<br> I'm sorry, miss, but he had no right<br> to rob me in the first place.<br> That was a terrible thing to do.<br> All right, Mr. Pritchett,<br> we won't take up any more of your time.<br> Now, here's the address, we'll see you<br> in court tomorrow morning at 10:00.<br> There goes John Q. Public. A man of iron.<br> Mr. Pritchett.<br> Jim, the Lieutenant's busy.<br> He doesn't want to be disturbed.<br> All right, Arthur. In there.<br> Jim...<br> why must you make everything<br> so black and white?<br> Don't be so intolerant.<br> - I'm just trying to warn you, Jim.<br> - What about?<br> You're digging your own grave.<br> It's right there in front of you.<br> One more step and you're in it.<br> You're very psychic today.<br> What's on your mind?<br> - Come on, champ, what's this about?<br> - Sit down, Tami.<br> $20 hat. You must be rolling.<br> $40. I'm comfortable.<br> What's on your mind, champ?<br> The woman you said hello to.<br> That girl's 100%.<br> I won't say a thing against her.<br> You don't have to. This is all off the record.<br> When I talk, it's for the record, champ.<br> Look, Giacoppetti, I'm Lieutenant<br> Monaghan, I'm in charge here.<br> Keep your tongue in your mouth<br> and we'll get along.<br> - You mind if I call my lawyer?<br> - It ain't necessary.<br> My lawyer gets mad, too.<br> Nothing you say here<br> will be held against you, understand?<br> I give you my word.<br> I won't hurt that girl.<br> I don't want you to. She's only a witness.<br> Sit down, Tami.<br> Okay.<br> - Shoot.<br> - When did you know her?<br> - Seven years ago.<br> - Like her?<br> I was crazy about her.<br> - She was my girl.<br> - What broke it up?<br> - She gave me the air.<br> - Why?<br> Why'd she give you the air, Tami?<br> I think maybe I better call my lawyer.<br> Look, Giacoppetti, we got a sheet on you.<br> All I got to do is lift that phone<br> and you're out of action. Capisce?<br> - Capisce.<br> - Well?<br> Well, one day she comes to me.<br> She's in trouble.<br> Now, I got to break it to her I'm married.<br> She's crying her eyes out.<br> I'd have married her<br> if I could have got a divorce.<br> I tell her I want that kid.<br> I'd go away with her...<br> give her anything she wants...<br> the moon out of the sky, I'd get it for her.<br> Dames, who can understand them?<br> Go on, Tami.<br> That's the last I see of her.<br> Then I hear she went to some doctor.<br> I find the place. She wouldn't see me.<br> The baby was born dead.<br> I had a little talk with that doctor.<br> I beat the daylights out of him.<br> What was his name?<br> Some Dutchman, some...<br> - Schneider?<br> - Yeah...<br> Karl Schneider?<br> - Yeah, that's it.<br> - Thanks, Tami.<br> Now, will you tell me what this is all about?<br> - Wait.<br> - Wait for what?<br> Wait.<br> Come in.<br> I'll have one of my men drive you home,<br> Mrs. McLeod.<br> - He told you, didn't he?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry I had to upset you...<br> but Jim has been persecuting Schneider<br> for over a year and I had to find out why.<br> But Jim never knew.<br> Schneider's attorney says so.<br> I don't care what he says. Jim never knew.<br> I never told him.<br> Mrs. McLeod, I wish I could believe you.<br> You've got to believe me.<br> This was my mistake.<br> You can't punish Jim for it.<br> If Schneider's badly hurt...<br> the Commissioner will be here,<br> the District Attorney.<br> If that happens, I got to have all the facts.<br> Lieutenant, I swear Jim doesn't know.<br> That's what I have to be sure of.<br> Now.<br> Well?<br> - McLeod.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Mary.<br> I've been trying to call you.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I sent for her.<br> Well, why?<br> That's Tami Giacoppetti.<br> Hi, champ.<br> - Say, what's this about, Lieutenant?<br> - Schneider.<br> Why'd you lie to me?<br> I didn't lie to you.<br> May I, please?<br> Go ahead.<br> Oh, Jim...<br> Sit down, Mary.<br> What's wrong, baby?<br> Jim, the Lieutenant won't believe<br> that you knew nothing about this.<br> About what, honey?<br> About Dr. Schneider.<br> What's he got to do with you?<br> Tell me, Mary.<br> I had occasion to see him once.<br> I went to him when I needed help.<br> What?<br> It was a long time ago.<br> I was going to have a baby.<br> Long before I met you, Jim.<br> I told you he didn't know.<br> I see.<br> Okay, diagrams aren't necessary.<br> - I get the picture.<br> - She's a good girl...<br> - Cut that out.<br> - I don't have to take that from you.<br> You touch me again<br> and I'll tear your arm out of the socket.<br> Jim.<br> Do you mind if I talk to my wife alone?<br> Okay, Tami.<br> Jim.<br> Jim, please forgive me.<br> Jim, I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me.<br> My immaculate wife.<br> I never said I was.<br> You never said you weren't.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I wanted to,<br> but I was so afraid of losing you.<br> How long did you go with him?<br> - A few months.<br> - How many?<br> - About six or seven.<br> - Seven isn't a few.<br> No, I suppose not.<br> Did he give you money?<br> No.<br> Give you presents?<br> Yes, he gave me some presents.<br> - Expensive ones?<br> - I don't know.<br> What do you mean, you don't know?<br> I don't know. What difference does it make?<br> This difference.<br> I'd just as soon Schneider died.<br> I'd rather go to jail for 20 years<br> than find out my wife was a tramp.<br> Don't say that, Jim.<br> That's the word, I didn't invent it.<br> That's what they call it.<br> I don't care about "they."<br> I only care about you, Jim,<br> and it isn't true. You know it isn't true.<br> I thought I knew you.<br> I thought you were everything good<br> and pure.<br> Don't judge me, Jim. Try to understand.<br> I was on my own for the first time<br> in a large city.<br> The war was on.<br> I'd only been out with kids my own age<br> until I met this man.<br> He paid me a lot of attention.<br> I was flattered.<br> I thought he was romantic and glamorous.<br> I thought I was in love with him.<br> What happened to the child?<br> It died at birth.<br> Is that why you can't have any children?<br> Oh, Jim, I can't take much more of this.<br> Please try and understand.<br> What's there to understand?<br> You went with him, a pig like that.<br> You had a child by him.<br> Then you went to that butcher, Schneider.<br> Everything I hate.<br> What's left to understand?<br> Just got word from the hospital.<br> Schneider's okay.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm sorry, Jim.<br> You don't look like a detective.<br> No? What's a detective look like?<br> They wear derbies.<br> - You're a nice-looking fellow.<br> - Thanks.<br> Are you married?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Don't work so hard.<br> - Height?<br> - Five-eleven.<br> - Weight?<br> - A hundred and sixty pounds.<br> - Eyes?<br> - I don't know, greenish.<br> - They look brown.<br> - Hazel.<br> You might as well go home now,<br> young lady.<br> As soon as we print him, I'm through.<br> All right, Arthur, over there.<br> It don't hurt.<br> It don't hurt. You roll it, like that.<br> It gets your hands a little dirty.<br> You wash it right off. It's nothing.<br> What's the matter? Did I say something?<br> You married?<br> Me neither.<br> Everybody tells you, "Why don't you<br> get married? You should be married."<br> My mother, my father, my sisters:<br> "Come on, get married."<br> As if I didn't want to get married.<br> Where do you find a man?<br> You get me a man and I'll marry him.<br> Anything, as long as it's got pants.<br> "Get married."<br> It's easy to talk.<br> All right, Arthur, wash your hands.<br> Charley, did you burglarize this apartment?<br> Why don't you give us a break?<br> You do us a favor, we might help you.<br> How you gonna help me?<br> I'm a four-time loser.<br> I'm going to jail the rest of my life.<br> How you gonna help me, huh?<br> You lived a louse, you want to die a louse?<br> Yeah. Remember, the sign says "Courtesy."<br> Courtesy, for you? You want courtesy?<br> Hey...<br> Yeah.<br> Okay, Barnes. Get them out here.<br> All right, Charley, rise and shine.<br> You, too, Lewis.

The thanks I get.<br> - $30,000, huh?<br> - Thirty, bull.<br> I saw the list.<br> Who do you believe, me or them?<br> No talking.<br> Them.<br> Quiet. You want to spoil the picture?<br> Okay, you two, over there.<br> What about that $1,400?<br> I had it on me for your protection.<br> This flatfoot had any sense,<br> he's supposed to take it and let us go.<br> Dumb cop. Can I help it?<br> Now, look. I want my share.<br> Lewis, if it's gonna make you happy...<br> you can have the whole $1,400.<br> Satisfied?<br> Yeah.<br> All right, Arthur.

You want to be in this?<br> - Got an aspirin, Joe?<br> - No.<br> Hey, you.<br> You're not going to put that<br> in the papers, are you?<br> It's all right, Suzy. I don't care.<br> Over there, Arthur.<br> You might as well go home now,<br> young lady. It's all over.<br> May I talk to Arthur for two minutes,<br> alone, please?<br> - What for?<br> - You wouldn't understand.<br> No, I guess not. All right.<br> Two minutes.<br> Okay, 8:45. Let's go.<br> Night court will be open<br> by the time we get there.<br> - What do I do?<br> - They'll tell you what to do.<br> Your brother-in-law's gonna be there,<br> ain't he?<br> Yeah.<br> All I can do is thank goodness<br> my sister's sexy.<br> So long, everybody.<br> Very nice meeting you, I mean it, very nice.<br> I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.<br> Bye.<br> Arthur, do you want to see Joy?<br> Would that help?<br> - Would you like to talk to her?<br> - No.<br> - I'll go and get her and bring her here.<br> - I don't want her, Suzy.<br> For five years I've been in love<br> with a girl that doesn't exist.<br> That's finished. Washed up.<br> Artie, why couldn't you have<br> fallen in love with me?<br> I'd have been so much better for you.<br> I've always loved you, Suzy.<br> You were always my baby.<br> I've got news for you.<br> I voted for the President in the last election.<br> I'm years past the age of consent.<br> Just an old bag.<br> - I'm not as beautiful as Joy is...<br> - But you are.<br> Joy's prettier than you,<br> but you're more beautiful.<br> - Oh, Artie.<br> - Come on, be my sensible Susan.<br> I can't be sensible about you. I love you.<br> You see that, Lewis? He's facing five to ten.<br> Wait till the boys start wising him up.<br> Hey, what makes you think<br> he'll want you then?<br> Shut up.<br> He'll keep coming back<br> for a second rap, for a third rap.<br> Then he'll be a four-time loser like me.<br> - Shut up, I tell you.<br> - Look at Lewis, here.<br> That's you five years from now.<br> Ain't it, Lewis?<br> - Shut up. I'll crack your skull!<br> - That's enough!<br> Stay over there, Arthur.<br> Why don't you shut up?<br> Oh, Officer...<br> Now, now, take it easy.<br> He's not convicted yet.<br> The judge might put him on probation.<br> A lot of things might happen.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> One more peep out of you, one!<br> Have you got a lawyer? I know a good one.<br> I'm not supposed to do this,<br> but I'll call him myself.<br> Here's your picture. Hide it from your kids.<br> We've been partners<br> about eight years now, Jim.<br> Did I ever ask you for a favor?<br> What is it, Lou?<br> That kid downstairs.<br> I want you to give him a break.<br> I can't do it, Lou.<br> He reminds me of my boy.<br> - Mike? Mike was a hero.<br> - Why, because he was killed?<br> If Mike were alive today, he'd have<br> the same problems this kid has.<br> What do you say?<br> Don't ask me, will you, Lou?<br> But I am asking you.<br> No, Lou. No dice.<br> Louder, please.<br> I can't seem to hear you so good.<br> I can't drop the charge.<br> Jim, this is me, Lou Brody. Remember me?<br> What do you mean,<br> you can't drop the charge?<br> - Mr. Pritchett left it up to you.<br> - I can't start compromising now.<br> Compromise.<br> Heart, Jim, heart.<br> The world is crying for a little heart.<br> You shouldn't drink so much.<br> It melts the lining of your brain.<br> Maybe that's what you need.<br> Maybe it would melt that rock<br> you've got for a heart.<br> Lay off, will you?<br> My partner. Arrest his own mother.<br> Lay off. I'm warning you.<br> What's the matter, Jim?<br> I'm drowning, Lou.<br> Drowning in my own juice.<br> I wish I could understand you.<br> I don't expect you to.<br> I know I'm different from the others.<br> I'm here out of principle.<br> All my life I've lived according to principle...<br> and I couldn't change, even if I wanted to.<br> Jim, you've got to bend with the wind,<br> or break.<br> Don't be such a monument.<br> How?<br> How do you compromise?<br> I hate softness. My mother was soft.<br> It killed her.<br> I don't believe in turning the other cheek.<br> You ask me to compromise on this kid.<br> Who's he?<br> Now, right now, I'm faced<br> with a problem of my own, Lou...<br> that's ripping my guts out,<br> and I can't compromise on that.<br> So what do I do?<br> Here's your aspirin.<br> - Listening at keyholes, Joe?<br> - I don't have to.<br> I've had that story for a long time.<br> She's one in a million, your Mary.<br> She loves you.<br> You don't know how lucky you are.<br> She brought warmth and tenderness<br> into your life.<br> I know.<br> - I know better than you do.<br> - Then go to her.<br> Get down on your knees, crawl.<br> She's downstairs, Jim.<br> Mary...<br> I'm leaving now, Jim. Here are the keys.<br> - Come inside.<br> - My taxi's waiting.<br> - We'll send it away.<br> - No, my things are in it.<br> - What things?<br> - My bags and my trunk.<br> Please come inside. I can't talk to you here.<br> - The meter's running.<br> - Let it run.<br> Look, Mary, this isn't the time<br> or place to discuss our lives.<br> Let's go home, we'll work this out there.<br> You think we can?<br> We'll have to.<br> I don't. I don't think it's possible.<br> Wait a minute. I don't get this.<br> What are you so bitter about?<br> Who's to blame for what happened tonight?<br> You put me through a cement mixer<br> and now you're acting as if I were the...<br> The tramp?<br> - Don't say that.<br> - I didn't invent the word either, Jim.<br> - I wasn't myself.<br> - You were never more yourself.<br> I've thought everything over<br> and over again...<br> and I don't see any other way out.<br> - We couldn't go on from here.<br> - Stop that kind of talk, will you, Mary?<br> I'm trying. I'm trying.<br> - To what?<br> - To put all this behind me.<br> - And you can't do it.<br> - lf you'll let me.<br> No, the rest of our lives<br> we'll be living with this.<br> If you won't be saying it,<br> you'll be thinking it.<br> And I couldn't take it.<br> I'd just dry up and die.<br> Please, I'm so tired, let me go now.<br> To what?<br> - Please, Jim.<br> - Where will you go?<br> You, who turn on every light<br> in the house when I'm not there.<br> You can't fall asleep<br> unless my arms are around you.<br> Stop it.<br> No. I'm not going to let you go.<br> Jim, you're hurting me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, Mary, but you just don't stop<br> loving someone.<br> I need you. Don't leave me.<br> I love you.<br> Then help me. Help me, Jim.<br> It's no use, baby.<br> I couldn't go home<br> if you weren't waiting for me.<br> I'd blow my brains out.<br> I would, Mary.<br> If I went home to an empty flat,<br> I wouldn't dare take my gun with me.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, his lawyer is here now,<br> waiting to find out. All right, I'll hang on.<br> Where's McLeod now?<br> Well, he...<br> What? Yeah, okay.<br> They're bringing Schneider in<br> at 10:00 A.M. to book him.<br> You can see him at the hospital after 9:00.<br> All right, I'll go over there.<br> Just a minute, McLeod.<br> - Some other time, Counselor.<br> - No, now.<br> They're bringing Schneider<br> back here tomorrow.<br> Then advise him again<br> to keep his mouth shut.<br> - And see that he does.<br> - I'm going to break you from the force.<br> If it's the last thing I do,<br> you're gonna pay for this.<br> How much was Miss Hatch paid?<br> Why don't you clean up your own house,<br> before you start to throw stones?<br> What do you mean by that?<br> You know what I mean.<br> No, I don't know what you mean.<br> Don't you?<br> - What's the matter, dear?<br> - Nothing.<br> - This has been a horrible day.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry, darling.<br> Yet I'm glad it's out in the open.<br> I've had such a terrible feeling<br> of guilt all the time.<br> All right.<br> I needed help and there was no one.<br> I couldn't even go to my parents.<br> - You didn't tell them?<br> - No, I didn't want to hurt them.<br> You know how sweet and simple they are.<br> You didn't go home then, after?<br> No.<br> - Where'd you go?<br> - I came to New York.<br> - How long was that before I met you?<br> - Two years.<br> Who'd you go with then?<br> No one.<br> How many others were there, Mary?<br> - Others?<br> - How many other men?<br> None. What's the matter with you, Jim?<br> Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> No. What's the matter with you?<br> At an autopsy the other day...<br> I watched the medical examiner<br> saw off the top of a man's skull...<br> take out the brain and hold it in his hand.<br> Like that.<br> Why are you telling me this?<br> Because I'd give my soul<br> to take out my brain...<br> hold it under the faucet and wash away...<br> the dirty pictures you put there today.<br> - Dirty pictures?<br> - Yes.<br> Oh, I see.<br> I see.<br> Yes, that would be fine...<br> if we could.<br> But when you wash away<br> what I may have put there...<br> you'll find you've a rotten spot<br> in your brain, Jim...<br> and it's growing. I know, I've watched it.<br> - Mary, that's enough.<br> - No, let's have the truth.<br> I could never find it in me<br> to see tiny flaws in you...<br> because I loved you. Oh, I still do.<br> But let's have the truth for once.<br> You think you're on the side<br> of the angels? Well, you're not.<br> You haven't even a drop<br> of ordinary human forgiveness...<br> in your whole nature.<br> You're a cruel and vengeful man.<br> You're everything you always said<br> you hated in your own father.<br> I'm not going to listen anymore.<br> I'm taking you home now.<br> What for? So you can drive me<br> to a lunatic asylum?<br> Where are you going?<br> Goodbye, Jim.<br> - When will I see you?<br> - Never.<br> There's nothing doing here.<br> I'll go down to night court<br> and see if I can pick up anything there.<br> - How'd you make out?<br> - Fine.<br> - I mean Mary.<br> - Fine. Dandy.<br> All right, young lady,<br> your two minutes are up.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Don't you feel well?<br> - Yes, sir. I feel all right.<br> - You better go home.<br> - I've got a squeal to finish off.<br> - Brody, finish it off.<br> - I'd rather do it myself.<br> You go home. That's an order.<br> What happened, Jim? What's wrong?<br> Mary left me.<br> She'll come back.<br> No. We're finished.<br> You drove her away, didn't you? Why?<br> I tried to warn you, you fool. Why?<br> I don't know. Why do we do<br> these things, Joe? Who knows?<br> I built my whole life on hating my father...<br> and all the time he was inside of me,<br> laughing.<br> Maybe he was crying.<br> Poor devil,<br> maybe he couldn't help himself, either.<br> Officer, somebody just stole my purse.<br> - Did you see who did it?<br> - No, I was walking down the street...<br> and someone grabbed it<br> right out of my hand.<br> It was so crowded I couldn't see him.<br> - Did you have much money in it?<br> - About $10.<br> Let's have a description.<br> Well, it was about so...<br> Drop that club. Drop it!<br> Drop it, Barnes. He's a four-time loser.<br> He'll kill you.<br> Rot in jail the rest of my life, I take five<br> or six of you coppers with me first.<br> Take it easy.<br> He can't get by the downstairs desk.<br> Shut up!<br> One word, one move, anybody.<br> I was wondering when<br> you'd get around to it, Charley.<br> None of your guff.<br> Give me that gun.<br> In the gut you'll get it.<br> One step, I'm warning you. One!<br> Easy, Jim. He can't get by the desk.<br> Jim, don't be a fool.<br> You dirty, sneaking, evil...<br> - Come on, baby, I'll get you to bed.<br> - No, wait a minute.<br> - Now, Jim.<br> - Don't pull at me, I...<br> You got to lie down, Jim.<br> No. Once I lie down, I'm not getting up.<br> Get an ambulance, quick.<br> Never mind a doctor.<br> Get a priest.<br> You feel that bad, Jim?<br> St. Vincent's Rectory.<br> Get me a drink.<br> - With a belly wound?<br> - What difference does it make?<br> Let him have it.<br> Don't whisper, Lou. I can hear you.<br> Sure you can, Jim.<br> You're gonna be okay, they can't hurt you.<br> Give me your hand. Squeeze.<br> Send a priest over to the 21st.<br> Harder.<br> To administer the last rites.<br> Give me buster's prints.<br> I don't know, maybe you're right, Lou.<br> I don't know anymore.<br> Get me his prints.<br> Here, Jim.<br> Joe...<br> find her.<br> Ask her to forgive me. And help her.<br> She needs help.<br> Sure. Now, take it easy.<br> Here you are, Jim.<br> Tear them up, Lou.<br> Unchain him. The keys are in my pocket.<br> There's no case here, Lieutenant.<br> The complainant withdrew...<br> Oh, Mary. Mary.<br> "In the name of the Father and<br> of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<br> "Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry<br> for having offended Thee...<br> "and I detest all my sins<br> because I dread the loss of Heaven...<br> "and the pains of Hell."<br> "But most all, for having offended Thee,<br> my Lord...<br> "who art all good and deserving of my love.<br> "But I firmly resolve with the help of<br> Thy Grace, to confess my sins...<br> "to do penance and to amend my life.<br> "Amen."<br> All right, son, go on home.<br> Don't make a monkey out of me.<br> If I see you up here again,<br> I'll kick the guts out of you.<br> Don't make a monkey out of me.<br> Don't worry, I won't.<br> He won't.<br> All right, go on, get out of here.<br> Get me the Telegraph Bureau.<br> - Get this, Harv.<br> - Notify the Commissioner.<br> "Detective First Grade, James McLeod,<br> District Attorney...<br> "Shot and killed in the line of duty..."<br>
