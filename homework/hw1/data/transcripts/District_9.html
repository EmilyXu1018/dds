                        You know, after last year's corporate,<br> my wife was always encouraging me.<br> You know, she said: you did fine,<br> you did fine in the corporate.<br> I was a bit nervous.<br> This little guy... hello. Sorry.<br> That's nice, eh? Nice background<br> with the people there...<br> We are here at the... must I look..?<br> -Just look straight at the lens.<br> We are here at the...<br> MNU head office,<br> Department of Alien Affairs.<br> My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.<br> And behind me you can see<br> the Alien Affairs' workers.<br> And what we do here<br> at this department is...<br> we try to engage with the Prawn<br> on behalf of MNU<br> and on behalf of humans.<br> To everyone's surprise,<br> the ship didn't come to a stop<br> over Manhattan<br> or Washington or Chicago,<br> but instead it costed to a halt<br> directly over the city of Johannesburg.<br> The doors didn't open for 3 months.<br> It just hovered there. Nobody could get in.<br> And they eventually decided,<br> after much deliberation,<br> that the best thing to do would be<br> to physically cut their way in.<br> We were on the verge<br> of first contact.<br> The whole world was watching.<br> Expecting, I don't know...<br> ...music from heaven<br> and bright shining lights.<br> Oh my God!<br> The creatures were<br> extremely malnourished,<br> they were very unhealthy,<br> they seemed to be aimless.<br> There was a lot of international<br> pressure on us at the time.<br> The entire world was<br> looking at Johannesburg,<br> so we had to do the right thing.<br> The government then established<br> an aid group that started to<br> ferry the aliens to a temporary camp<br> set up just beneath the ship.<br> We didn't have a plan.<br> There was a million of them.<br> So, what was a temporary<br> holding zone soon became fenced,<br> became militarized. And before<br> we knew it, it was a slum.<br> But the truth is, nobody really<br> knew what this place was.<br> There's a lot of secrets<br> in District 9.<br> At first, a lot of attention<br> was given to...<br> giving the aliens a proper status<br> and protection.<br> They're spending so much money<br> to keep them here.<br> When they could be spending it<br> on other things, but...<br> ...at least they're keeping them<br> separate from us.<br> l want to be realistic with everyone.<br> The aliens will not be able to go home.<br> The aliens are here to stay.<br> There were literally thousands<br> of different theories<br> as to why the ship seemed inoperable,<br> and what was speculated was that<br> the command module had detached<br> itself from the main ship,<br> and then somehow<br> mysteriously became lost.<br> Did it fall by itself or was it<br> programmed? I don't know.<br> Examination of the<br> old video footage<br> shows very clearly<br> that a piece falls from the ship.<br> We look for it.<br> We look everywhere.<br> This piece that's falling<br> caused us bloody problems.<br> More energy weapon caches found.<br> The Special task force<br> conducted raids in District 9.<br> Where there's a weapon, there's crime.<br> Tensions rose, and rose.<br> People became more and more fed up,<br> and eventually the rioting started.<br> Residents in Tembisa rioted<br> for the third consecutive night<br> in an attempt to remove<br> all the aliens from their township.<br> I think they must fix that ship<br> and they must go.<br> A virus, a selective virus.<br> Release it near the aliens.<br> They must just go.<br> I don't know where, just go.<br> If they was from another country<br> we might understand.<br> But they are not<br> even from this planet.<br> The government have enforced<br> a nationwide curfew.<br> The aliens, prawns,<br> they take my wife away.<br> The derogatory term Prawn is used<br> for the alien, and obviously it implies<br> something that is a bottom feeder,<br> that scavenges the leftovers.<br> I mean, you can't say<br> they don't look like that.<br> That's what they look like, right?<br> They look like prawns.<br> The aliens made off with an undisclosed<br> amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.<br> What for an alien might be seen<br> as something recreational,<br> setting fire to a truck,<br> derailing a train,<br> is for us obviously<br> an extremely destructive act.<br> They can take the sneakers<br> you are wearing off you.<br> They take whatever you have on you.<br> Your cell phone or anything.<br> After that they kill you.<br> And now, after 20 years, public<br> pressure had forced the government<br> to shift the aliens<br> out of Johannesburg.<br> They had had enough and they<br> wanted District 9 to be moved,<br> and more intensively<br> policed and controlled.<br> So, to enforce this mass eviction,<br> the government turned to MNU.<br> Welcome all<br> and thank you for coming.<br> Please listen very closely<br> to this briefing.<br> Today we start a very complex<br> and delicate operation.<br> This is the largest operation<br> that MNU has ever undertaken,<br> and we believe that it is going<br> to be undertaken successfully.<br> It is to move 1.8 million prawns<br> from their present home in District 9<br> to a safer and better location<br> Johannesburg City.<br> We built a nice new facility<br> where the prawn can go,<br> he can be comfortable,<br> he can stay there...<br> The people of Johannesburg and<br> of South Africa are going to live<br> happily and safely, knowing that<br> that prawn is very far away.<br> UIO protocol dictates<br> that we give the aliens<br> of our right to evict.<br> Today, you will serve these notices<br> getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.<br> The legality that MNU is using to evict<br> the aliens is simply a whitewash.<br> I'm going to appoint a field officer<br> to take direct command.<br> Wikus Van De Merwe.<br> Everybody always said that<br> Wikus was not a very smart boy,<br> but he was a wonderful son.<br> That was my Wikus, just...<br> Feels like life on the big stage.<br> Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.<br> l had to put aside the fact that<br> my daughter was married to Wikus.<br> That didn't affect my decision<br> to promote him.<br> It's almost as big as my wedding day.<br> You know... not as big.<br> Wikus was always making me things.<br> He said that way<br> they just mean so much more.<br> He left this paper-mache bowl<br> on the sofa one day<br> and I didn't see it and I sat down,<br> and I... kinda squashed it.<br> They took all his stuff away<br> for the investigation, and...<br> I made them bring it all back.<br> Hey, congratulations, man!<br> -Thanks, man.<br> Okay, we're gonna go to District.<br> -Wikus! -How is it going, man?<br> Here's the shake.<br> B9 for you. -Thanks.<br> I'm not saying<br> what he did was right, but...<br> he took the choices<br> that were given to him.<br> This is Trent.<br> Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.<br> Fundiswa is the guy that<br> I've selected to replace me.<br> If he can make it today, eh?<br> -I'll make it.<br> I just want everyone<br> watching this right now<br> to learn from what has happened.<br> -You would think...<br> things like this would happen<br> to somebody else, not to me.<br> How is it going, man? Long time,<br> mate. Have you got my stuff?<br> Hey, boss! -How is it going?<br> -I'm all right, boss.<br> Good, good, this is Fundiswa.<br> He is driving with us today.<br> I think I was disgusted with<br> the way he worked.<br> There was always just a hint<br> of something not quite kosher<br> with mr Van De Merwe.<br> -Nobody saw it coming at all.<br> None of us had any idea<br> of what he was doing.<br> l think it is a great<br> thing to see that...<br> it's not the military guys<br> in charge this time.<br> Not to say that Koobus<br> and his cowboys are not wanted.<br> You guys are always wanted.<br> You see now,<br> these are the cowboys.<br> They shoot first, and then<br> they answer the questions.<br> Sorry, is this above the allocated<br> amount of ammunition?<br> Because I see your<br> pouches are full but...<br> I think maybe you should<br> speak to the colonel.<br> F.A.G. over here says that<br> we got too much ammunition.<br> No, all I'm saying, Koobus,<br> is that, you know...<br> you should find ways of making<br> you guys more efficient...<br> Listen to me, you fuck!<br> Get him outta my face.<br> There are rules, we're all living<br> by rules in this world.<br> Well, l don't think he can<br> be forgiven for what he did,<br> cause it's like a betrayal.<br> -I've gotta get going, Les.<br> I think we're gonna have to cut<br> this interview, cause we're gonna go...<br> Take your magazines, people.<br> Come on, lets go.<br> The Prawn doesn't really understand<br> the concept of ownership of property.<br> So, we have to come there and say:<br> listen, this is our land.<br> Please, will you go?<br> It's difficult to put<br> the vest on by yourself.<br> Thomas, can you help me?<br> -All right, boss.<br> They told me I was gonna<br> get the vest inside the Casper.<br> Thomas, just look on the side<br> if there's a vest there?<br> I'm just concerned about my family.<br> -Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.<br> Rights groups have demanded<br> that mercenaries should comply<br> with all UIO regulations<br> in District 9.<br> We're coming to you<br> from the entrance of District 9<br> as today, Multi National United<br> sets out to relocate<br> approximately 1.8 million<br> alien residents from their homes.<br> Human rights groups are<br> keeping a watchful eye,<br> as many suspect<br> abuses might occur.<br> We're seeing heavily armed<br> private security forces<br> being deployed into District 9.<br> Backed up by<br> significant air support.<br> We'll go shack to shack<br> and get them to sign the form.<br> First one E.X. triple 7.<br> We're seeing the convoy stop.<br> The operation is about to begin.<br> Just stay focused.<br> Are you ready, Thomas?<br> -Yeah. -Okay.<br> Is that a signal?<br> Okay, fellows.<br> You stay behind us.<br> Good luck, boy.<br> Stay low! Where is he going?<br> What is it?<br> It's clear that security is very high.<br> This is only the beginning<br> of a total clamp down.<br> This is MNU agents.<br> Open the door please! -Open up!<br> Hello! Hello, hello...<br> This is Wikus Van De Merwe<br> from MNU.<br> We are here to serve you<br> an eviction notice.<br> You just put your scrawl there.<br> -Fuck off!<br> All right! Thomas, hold it!<br> We've got his scrawl there.<br> Because as he hit it,<br> it counts as a scrawl.<br> First time we come in,<br> there will always be a little bit<br> of tension happening<br> between us and them.<br> Hey, you can't eat that, man!<br> The prawn likes to eat the rubber.<br> To him it's like a marshmallow.<br> No, no! Guard!<br> Don't confront him like that!<br> Did you see that?<br> Right in the roost. Stay calm!<br> This is gonna be a problem cause<br> now all prawns are coming out,<br> they wanna see what's going on.<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> Bring my kit.<br> See, everybody is gathering now.<br> Don't shoot or you're gonna<br> turn it into a warzone!<br> What is that? Is that a tear gas?<br> -No, it's cat food.<br> It is cat food.<br> I just distract them.<br> No it's not my house.<br> I don't live here.<br> Well, that's a pity because,<br> you know, this...<br> This is a nice cat food, you know.<br> But of course, it's not your house.<br> So, we'll just have to go and give it<br> to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!<br> We need you to sign here.<br> Now you can take that...<br> All right. Stop it!<br> The creatures became incredibly<br> obsessed with cat food.<br> Something about it, like catnip<br> for cats. Only a lot more intense.<br> Hello? MNU. We are here<br> to serve eviction notices.<br> What is eviction?<br> What we have stranded<br> on Earth in this colony,<br> is basically the workers that are<br> unable to think for themselves.<br> They will take commands,<br> they have no initiative.<br> They've lost all the<br> apt of leadership<br> through whatever cause.<br> We presume illness.<br> I'm holding steady over<br> Nigerian compound area.<br> Where there's a slum, there's crime.<br> And District 9 was no exception.<br> The nigerians had various scams going.<br> One of them was the cat food scam.<br> Where they sold cat food to<br> the aliens for exorbitant prices.<br> You put the money here first.<br> You don't get anything until you pay.<br> What are you trying to do?<br> I'll chop your balls off.<br> Not to mention<br> interspecies prostitution,<br> and they also dealt<br> in alien weaponry.<br> You have a car hijacking,<br> there's a chop shop there,<br> you can see that,<br> that's somebody's car in there.<br> The nigerians in District 9 are<br> headed by a man called Obesandjo.<br> He's a very powerful<br> underground figure in Johannesburg.<br> You don't want to play<br> with these boys.<br> They will cut you into pieces.<br> That's the boss there.<br> OK, no problem.<br> Don't look at him!<br> This is gonna cause problems.<br> All right, next. 766, all right.<br> MNU agents.<br> Open the door please!<br> Whoa! Jesus! What is it?<br> Check the other side!<br> Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.<br> I need a population control team<br> at JV 766 immediately, please.<br> Check the other side, Thomas!<br> There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.<br> Is this normal?<br> -This is an amazing find.<br> l can just show you<br> a little bit how it works.<br> Basically, a cow is hung from<br> the ceiling, you can see here.<br> Very little of it left, of course,<br> because all these pipes<br> supply the nutrition<br> to the little prawn eggs.<br> You can do one, I can show you,<br> want to see? -No, I'm fine.<br> There we go. Okay,<br> no more nutrition to the guy.<br> Then finally we take air back.<br> The little guy is gone<br> to a nice little sleep now.<br> You pop him out, there we go.<br> Pop him out here.<br> You can take that. You wanna keep it<br> as a souvenir of your first abortion.<br> You can feel like you did<br> one of these here. -Thanks, boss.<br> Okay, here it comes, guys.<br> This is the snake.<br> If we were going to abort<br> each egg one at the time,<br> it'd take a very long time.<br> So, this makes a lot of sense.<br> You hear that? That's a popping<br> sound that you're hearing.<br> It's almost like a popcorn.<br> What the egg does, it pops up.<br> The little guy, what's left of him,<br> pops out there.<br> So that's the sound that<br> you're hearing with the popping.<br> You don't need that, man.<br> Only sissies wear that.<br> Been drinking a little bit here, eh?<br> What are you doing with this<br> television set, sir? What's this?<br> Hey, smile for the cameras here.<br> That's a first day find.<br> -That's a big find.<br> You see this? Trent, look at this!<br> There's weapons all over here.<br> CK 5, 7572...<br> Some of the guns are small<br> but if it shoot you,<br> it make a big mess.<br> MNU is trying to move the aliens<br> for humanitarian reasons.<br> But the real focus,<br> just as it has been<br> right from the beginning,<br> is weapons.<br> MNU is the second largest<br> weapons manufacturer in the world.<br> We assumed that we'd be able<br> to pick up the alien laser gun<br> and just be able to shoot,<br> but it didn't work like that.<br> Because, as we discovered,<br> their technology is actually<br> engineered in a biological manner<br> to interact exclusively with their DNA.<br> It just doesn't work with humans.<br> And it's as simple as that.<br> This is basically a guy,<br> and there's 3 humans here.<br> Basically trying to make<br> a warning, you know.<br> He's saying "I kill 3 humans,<br> watch out for me."<br> Hey, don't urinate on your<br> own bloody... get back, get back.<br> This is Wikus, requesting<br> First Battalion escort, please.<br> You want to talk to them<br> or you want to talk to me?<br> No, not them!<br> Okay, guys, thanks very much.<br> Yeah I know, he had a spade.<br> Look-I find some!<br> I tell you before... this is<br> human technology, it is useless.<br> Only our technology<br> contains the fluid.<br> This is not our technology?<br> -No, it's junk.<br> Keep looking.<br> I find something.<br> Yes.

A prawn!<br> What happens to him<br> isn't important.<br> What's important is that we harvest<br> from him what we can right now.<br> This body represents<br> hundreds of millions,<br> maybe billions of dollars<br> worth of biotechnology.<br> There are people out there,<br> governments, corporations,<br> who'd kill for this chance.<br> Will he survive the procedure?<br> -No, of course not.<br> We need everything.<br> Tissue, bone marrow, blood.<br> The procedure is gonna basically<br> strip him down to nothing. -Please...<br> What about next of kin?<br> Please help me.<br> Don't let them do it.<br> I'll handle that.<br> Okay, I say let's go.<br> -Good, thank you.<br> I don't understand.<br> None of this makes any sense.<br> He just hurt his arm, dad.<br> The doctors are trying, sweetheart.<br> Doing their best to save him.<br> We're starting to harvest<br> material from the specimen.<br> We'll start with the soft tissue first.<br> Cut through the chest cavern.<br> We need to get the heart out<br> as quickly as possible.<br> Once it set the sinuosity,<br> it just spread.<br> You know Wikus.<br> He never was very strong.<br> I'll go through the chest,<br> go straight into the heart.<br> Be quiet, please.<br> -Fuck you!<br> Can I see him?<br> Not a good idea.<br> Fuck off!

We have to hide him.<br> Now you... get down there.<br> Where's the fluid?<br> What did you do with it?<br> -Please!<br> -You took it...<br> I don't know what<br> you're talking about!<br> ...I know you did.<br> I can see what's happening to you.<br> Tell me where it is.<br> Alright, alright.<br> Was it a black fluid<br> in a flask container?<br> Yes, that's it. Yes!<br> I confiscated it and<br> the guys at the lab took it.<br> It will be at the MNU.<br> MNU has it.<br> What is this?<br> -You ruined everything.<br> -Where is this?<br> Is that your shack?<br> This whole thing<br> is under your shack?<br> For 20 years you've...<br> this whole fokking' thing in here?<br> Jesus, this is very illegal.<br> I mean, this is a find, you know.<br> I wish they catch you with this.<br> Fuel goes in here.<br> That's enough! Quiet!<br> Then we fly away.<br> I said quiet!<br> We cannot trust him.<br> What is he saying about the fuel?<br> Are you trying to start this thing?<br> Are you little fuckers trying<br> to start this and get away?<br> Never mind.<br> Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.<br> Too bad. I could've fixed you.<br> What? What did you say...<br> about the fixing?<br> What do you mean<br> you could fix me?<br> Forget it.<br> It doesn't matter, it's too late.<br> No, listen! Listen.<br> Are you saying that you can...<br> turn this prawn hand<br> into a human hand?<br> You can make me human again?<br> We have medical machines on the<br> mothership that can fix you. Yes.<br> We can use this ship<br> to fly up there.<br> That's fantastic!<br> You guys are brilliant!<br> I always thought that prawns<br> were intelligent. Let's do it.<br> I don't have fluid.<br> I could fix you and I could fly away.<br> But I don't have fluid.<br> Right, okay.<br> All right, I tell you what.<br> Why don't we...<br> go risk it some more?<br> Let's go collect some up.<br> It took twenty years<br> to collect that amount.<br> Fuck, man! Fuck!<br> Fuck! The only one that exists<br> is the one I confiscated?<br> Yes.<br> It's four stories underground.<br> Why does he keep looking at me<br> like that? -He likes you.<br> We are the same.<br> We're not the same.<br> We're not the fokkin' same.<br> There is a way out of this.<br> We get the fluid back from MNU.<br> Yeah, and what then?<br> Then we both die, eh?<br> Both of us dead.<br> That's a suicide mission, man.<br> Can you not fill my head<br> with that sort of nonsense?<br> The transformation is accelerating.<br> You don't have much time.<br> Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!<br> Hello.<br> -Wikus?<br> -Tania! Baby...<br> -Are you okay?<br> -Oh God!

At the gate!<br> Watch the guards at the gate, man!<br> Move! Get out!<br> They're going down.<br> Four stories down.<br> This is alien weaponry.<br> Give me a status report.<br> It's Van De Merwe.<br> He's on level four.<br> Switch to live, and<br> then we're taking him out.<br> Colonel, we weren't allowed<br> to use live ammunition.<br> They want him alive.<br> Stay here until I call you.<br> -I understand.<br> I need to get the door open.<br> No! I said stay until I call you!<br> Fuck!<br> I thought you said<br> not to kill them?<br> He shot at me!<br> Fuck! Get out!<br> Don't fuckin' look at me!<br> Get out!<br> Get the fuck out!<br> Get out!<br> Everybody get the fuck out!<br> Get out! Go!<br> Move the fuck out! Go!<br> What is this place?<br> -Don't worry about that.<br> What do they do in here?<br> Check these boxes.<br> Any type of a box that looks like<br> it can hold a tube. Just check it out!<br> These fuckers!<br> Go, go, go...<br> Clear.<br> I got it! I got it!<br> Chris, I got it. Let's go!<br> Christopher!<br> Oh, fuck!<br> Listen... I promise you,<br> I didn't know they were doing this.<br> Until they brought me here<br> the other day,<br> I swear to you I did not know<br> they were doing this to you guys.<br> But Christopher...<br> look at me. Listen to me.<br> We need to leave now. Okay?<br> The whole of MNU<br> is gonna come down here.<br> He's going to destroy us.<br> We can do this, okay?<br> We're gonna get out of here...<br> Fire!<br> Move, move!<br> Shoot at the prawn!<br> Christopher!<br> What the fuck are you doing?<br> Think of your boy,<br> for fuck sake!<br> What the hell are you doing?<br> Are you out of your fuckin' mind?<br> You're gonna get us killed!<br> -What do we do now?<br> I thought you had a way out?<br> I didn't say anything<br> about the way out.<br> I promised you that we'll get in.<br> We're in! -I have an idea.<br> -Where are you going?<br> -Follow me!<br> What are you doing?<br> -Making a bomb.<br> Let's go!<br> Quick! Get in!<br> Go! Drive!<br> Okay!<br> Okay, hold on!<br> Fuck!<br> Reports are coming in of explosion<br> in downtown Johannesburg.<br> Well, there was a terrorist attack,<br> but I can assure you that we<br> dealt with it.

To fix me.<br> It's going to take a bit<br> longer than I thought.<br> Okay, that's fine.<br> How long do you need?<br> Three years.<br> Sorry, just go slowly<br> with the clicks there,<br> it sounded like you said<br> "three years", like human years.<br> Yes. Three years.<br> What? Three fuckin' years?<br> I will fix you,<br> but first I must save my people.<br> The deal was:<br> you go home, I get fixed!<br> I will not let my people<br> be medical experiments!<br> I'm a fokkin' medical experiment!<br> You hear me, Christopher?<br> I'm a fokkin' medical<br> experiment, man!<br> I must go home and get help.<br> I must use all the fluid<br> to travel quickly.<br> I'll just stay here, Christopher?<br> I'll just stay here in this shit.<br> And I'll see you in three years time?<br> -I will come back. I promise.<br> Christopher!<br> Where the fuck is he?<br> Hey, you got Wikus<br> down there, my boy?<br> -Father?<br> -No, no, no.<br> Your daddy needs to stay here<br> to sort out a few things, alright?<br> We're gonna go.

Get out!<br> This is remarkable.<br> It looks like something is<br> emerging from the ground.<br> Something is definitely<br> coming out of the ground.<br> Okay... steady!<br> Go sit down,<br> I can't play with ya now.<br> Uncle Wikus is flying.<br> Bug off. Bug off!<br> Lock the weapon at target!<br> Fire when locked.<br> It seems to be drifting towards<br> the center of the territory.<br> We have a lock on him. -Fire!<br> Something is fired upon...<br> it has been hit!<br> What the fuck is that?<br> One of the engines is billowing<br> smoke, it's out of control.<br> It's going down, boss. Should I<br> send the boys to fuck him up?<br> Now... it hit the ground,<br> the massive impact,<br> and it's come to a standstill.<br> My son!<br> My son's in there!<br> Shut the fuck up!<br> Get this fucker inside.<br> We're moving out.<br> Come, let's go, let's go...<br> Move!<br> We're banking around now, trying<br> to get a better view of the ship<br> which is absolutely wrecked,<br> waiting for some of the smoke to clear.<br> Somebody has been<br> brought out of the vehicle.<br> It looks like a human being.<br> We are getting unconfirmed<br> reports that this might be<br> Wikus Van De Merwe, a fugitive<br> that has been on the run<br> from MNU for the past 3 days.<br> They are loading him into<br> a vehicle now, and heading off.<br> What the fuck?<br> Bring him to me.<br> Come on! Get back!<br> Oh, fuck!<br> Control, we're taking enemy fire!<br> We need support. Backup, now!<br> Fuck off! Fuck off, man!<br> Get you hands off me!<br> Fuckin' get off me!<br> Get your fuckin' hands off me!<br> Didn't I tell you...<br> that I'm gonna get you?<br> You came in here and you left<br> with something that belongs to me.<br> Fuck you.<br> Fuck you all!<br> I told you that<br> the day will come.<br> You've been running<br> around with my prize.<br> All I want is to eat that hand<br> and become like you.<br> No! It won't work...<br> Once I have that power,<br> no one will stop me.<br> It was your turn...<br> now it's mine!<br> Fighting MNU security forces,<br> this armed faction is doomed...<br> Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.<br> We're getting reports claiming that<br> the alien device is activating...<br> You see that prawn<br> back in the Casper? -Yeah.<br> He knows what the fuck<br> is up with that ship.<br> Get that fucker out<br> and get him talking, now.<br> Three contractors are closing in<br> on the nigerian compound, and...<br> Come, alien!<br> What's your plan?<br> How are you doing it?<br> Who's moving that ship?<br> All right, that's very clever.<br> Wait for my command.<br> Make sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.<br> Fuck! Move it! Move it!<br> Bring that fucker down!<br> Hold you fire! Hold your fire<br> and keep your positions!<br> It's Van De Merwe.<br> Hey, Dickus!<br> I'll come back for prawn,<br> alright guys?<br> Do you hear me, now?<br> -Run, Wikus!<br> -You hear me?<br> -Run!<br> And keep on running,<br> you fuckin' coward!<br> Run! Run!<br> Get the air support up,<br> and get on his fuckin' trail, now!<br> It's not gonna work, boss.<br> He's a tough one.<br> He's not gonna talk.<br> -Then just fuckin' kill him.<br> He's not gonna talk.<br> -Then just fuckin' kill him.<br> Fuck!<br> He's a tough one.<br> He's not gonna talk.<br> Then just fuckin' kill him.<br> Hey, c'mon. Get up!<br> I'm gonna get you out of here.<br> -I can't... it's too far.<br> -It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!<br> I'm gonna get you there.<br> I'm gonna get you to your boy!<br> C'mon, stay behind me!<br> Go back!<br> Run, run, run!<br> Arriving at the location now.<br> We have a clearance to engage.<br> Prawns are coming,<br> get down, get down!<br> There is no other option.<br> Knock these fuckers off!<br> Come to mommy, come...<br> Fuck!<br> Shit!<br> Are you hurt?<br> We can make it.<br> I was shot in the arm.<br> We can make it, come on!<br> Listen, you go ahead.<br> You can make it.<br> I'm gonna just... hold them<br> off here, and I'll join you soon.<br> No, we stick together.<br> I'm not leaving you here.<br> Take your boy and go home.<br> You have to make it.<br> Don't make me go through<br> all of this and not make it.<br> Do you understand?<br> -I will come back for you.<br> Go! Go now before<br> I change my mind! Go!<br> Three years. I promise.<br> I'm not fuckin' scared of you!<br> Quit fuckin' with me!<br> You want me?<br> You want me?<br> Is that all you got?<br> Is that all you fuckin' got?<br> Some kind of quite extraordinary<br> light from the mothership.<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> It's a beam of light...<br> Full scan. Okay.<br> Fire!<br> Get to the vehicle, now! Get going.<br> -Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!<br> Fuck!<br> Quit playing with me, Koobus!<br> You fucker!<br> Go, Chris, go.<br> Go home.<br> We go home now?<br> Yes.<br> Unbelievable.<br> Now I know why everybody<br> wants a piece of you.<br> I can't wait for those<br> med boys to cut you up.<br> But you know what?<br> You're not gonna waste<br> any more of my time.<br> You half-breed piece of shit!<br> I'm gonna just fuckin'<br> kill you myself.<br> Stay back, you fuck!<br> Stay back!<br> Stay back!<br> The people everywhere<br> across Johannesburg<br> are flooding the streets and<br> pouring out of their offices<br> and all eyes are pointed up towards<br> the sky on this momentous day.<br> It's the first time, ladies and<br> gentlemen, in over two decades,<br> that the mothership has shown<br> any sign of movement,<br> and people are<br> tremendously excited.<br> The city had come<br> to an absolute standstill.<br> Everybody wants to know<br> what's going to happen next.<br> There's no way of knowing whether<br> or not Christopher Johnson will return.<br> We don't know if<br> he was simply escaping,<br> whether he will<br> effect a rescue plan...<br> ...and, as the so called<br> free press says,<br> whether or not he will come back<br> and declare a war on us.<br> This is the last known footage<br> of Wikus Van De Merwe.<br> And we can only speculate<br> as to what has happened to him.<br> The more zany conspiracy<br> theories state that<br> he's been captured by MNU<br> or by another government.<br> Or by perhaps some<br> shady government agency<br> and he's actually<br> being held in captivity.<br> If we knew where he was,<br> we would try and help him,<br> and that is the most difficult part,<br> not knowing where he is.<br> Wikus, sadly, is gone but<br> I'm the one who stays behind<br> with all the questions.<br> I can't give the answers.<br> He died in my mind a long<br> time ago. And that's that.<br> Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name<br> that will become very widely known<br> because of this pivotal role<br> that he played in this whole event.<br> He was an honest man, and he didn't<br> deserve any of what happened to him.<br> I mean, I know. I looked into a<br> computer system and I found stuff.<br> I mean, the whole data<br> was there, you know?<br> They didn't even do<br> a good job of hiding it.<br> Fundiswa Mhlanga is<br> currently awaiting trial<br> for exposing MNU's illegal<br> genetic research program.<br> District 9 was demolished<br> after the alien resettlement<br> operation was completed.<br> District 10 now houses 2.5 million<br> aliens and continues to grow...<br> You guys haven't seen a picture of<br> my wife. Let me show you my wife.<br> She's my special angel.<br> She even looks like an angel<br> with veil, you want to see that?<br> Look, you see,<br> with the white veil over the...<br> she even looks like an angel.<br> Everyone says that his wife is angel,<br> but this is a real angel that you<br> see there, on the cameras.<br> They won't put that<br> in the video, I don't think.<br> I found this at my front door.<br> As tho somebody had<br> just left it there.<br> My friends say that<br> I should throw it away,<br> cause it's just a piece of rubbish.<br> That it couldn't possibly<br> come from him.<br> I know it's true.<br>
