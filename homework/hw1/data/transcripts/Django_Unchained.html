                        <br> Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?<br> State your business,<br> or prepare to get winged!<br> Calm yourselves gentlemen,<br> I mean you no harm.<br> I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.<br> Good cold evening gentlemen,<br> I'm looking for a pair of slave traders<br> that go by the name of<br> the Speck Brothers.<br> Might that be you?<br> Who wants to know?<br> Well, I do.<br> I'm Dr. King Schultz,<br> this is my horse, Fritz.<br> What kinda doctor?<br> Dentist.<br> Now are you the Speck Brothers,<br> and did you purchase those men<br> at the Greenville slave auction?<br> So what?<br> So, I wish to parley with you.<br> Speak English.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Please forgive me,<br> it is a second language.<br> Now, amongst your inventory,<br> I've been led to believe,<br> is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.<br> Hello you poor devils!<br> Is there one amongst you, who was formerly<br> a resident of The Carrucan Plantation?<br> I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.<br> Who said that?<br> What's your name?<br> Django.<br> Then you're exactly<br> the one I'm looking for.<br> Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?<br> Who are they?<br> Big John<br> Ellis<br> and Raja<br> sometime they call him Lit'le Raj.<br> They was overseers at Carrucan plantation.<br> Not anymore.<br> Tell me<br> If you were to see any of these three<br> gentlemen again, would you recognize them?<br> Hey!<br> Stop talk with 'em like that.<br> Like what?<br> Like that!<br> My good man,<br> I'm simply trying to ascertain-<br> Speak English, goddammit!<br> Everybody calm down,<br> I'm simply a customer<br> trying to conduct a transaction.<br> I don't care.<br> No sale.<br> Now off wit' you!<br> Oh, don't be ridiculous,<br> o'course they're for sale.<br> Move it.<br> My good man, did you simply get<br> carried away with your dramatic gesture,<br> or are you pointing your weapon<br> at me with lethal intention?<br> Last chance, fancy pants.<br> Oh, very well<br> I'm sorry to have put<br> a bullet in your beast,<br> but I didn't want you to do anything rash<br> before you had a moment<br> to come to your senses.<br> Goddamn son of a bitch!<br> You shot Roscoe!<br> And you killed Ace!<br> Hey, I only shot your brother<br> once he threatened to shoot me.<br> And I do believe I have<br> one, two, three, four, five witnesses<br> who can attest to that fact.<br> Damn legs busted!<br> No doubt. Now, if you can keep<br> your caterwauling down to a minimum,<br> I'd like to finish my line<br> of inquiry with young Django.<br> God fucking dammit!<br> As I was saying,<br> if you were to see the Brittle Brothers<br> again, you could recognize them?<br> Yeah.<br> Sold American!<br> So Mr. Speck,<br> Mr. Speck, how much<br> for young Django here?<br> That iron is nasty business.<br> Could you hold this for a moment?<br> Thank you.<br> Django, get up on that horse.<br> Also if I were you, I'd take that winter<br> coat the dear departed Speck left behind.<br> Nigger, don't you touch my brother's coat!<br> Goddammit!<br> One hundred ten<br> twenty and five<br> for young Django here.<br> And since you won't be needing it anymore,<br> I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.<br> Also Mr. Speck, I am afraid<br> I will require a bill of sale.<br> Do you have one?<br> You go to hell, dentist!<br> I thought not.<br> No worries!<br> I come prepared.<br> Thank you.<br> This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.<br> Now as to you poor devils<br> So as I see it, when it comes to<br> the subject of what to do next,<br> you gentlemen have two choices.<br> One: once I'm gone, you could lift<br> that beast off the remaining Speck,<br> then carry him to the nearest town.<br> Which would be at least thirty-seven<br> miles back the way you came.<br> Or Two:<br> You could unshackle yourselves<br> take that rifle, put a bullet in his head,<br> bury the two of them deep,<br> and then make your way to a more<br> enlightened area of this country.<br> The choice is yours.<br> Oh, and on the off chance there are<br> any astronomy aficionados amongst you,<br> the North Star is that one.<br> Tata.<br> Now wait a minute fellas,<br> let's talk about this.<br> You gotta be reasonable<br> on a situation like this.<br> I'm not a bad guy,<br> look I'm just doing my job!<br> Blueberry, didn't I give you<br> my last apple?<br> Tell you what boys, take me to Lit'le Duck<br> in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.<br> No. No, please-<br> What's everybody staring at?<br> They never seen a nigger<br> on a horse before.<br> Good morning inn keeper!<br> Two beers for two weary travelers.<br> Ah, it's still a bit early.<br> We won't be open for another hour.<br> By then we'll be servin' breakfast.<br> Wow wow wow wow!<br> What the hell you think you doin', boy?<br> Get that nigger outta here.<br> Help! Help!<br> Inn keeper!<br> Remember, get the sheriff,<br> not the marshall.<br> Alas<br> Now we must act<br> as our own bartender.<br> Sit down, my boy.<br> What kinda dentist are you?<br> Despite that cart, I haven't<br> practiced dentistry in five years.<br> These days I practice a new profession.<br> Bounty Hunter.<br> D'you know what a Bounty Hunter is?<br> No.<br> Well<br> The way the slave trade<br> deals in human lives for cash,<br> a bounty hunter deals in corpses.<br> Prost.<br> The state places a bounty on a man's head,<br> I track that man, I find<br> that man, I kill that man,<br> after I've killed him, I transport that<br> man's corpse back to the authorities,<br> and sometimes that's<br> easier said then done,<br> I show that corpse to the authorities<br> proving, yes indeed,<br> I truly have killed him, at which point<br> the authorities pay me the bounty.<br> So like slavery, it's a<br> flesh-for-cash business.<br> What's a bounty?<br> It's like a reward.<br> You kill people and<br> they give you a reward?<br> Certain people, yeah.<br> Bad people?<br> Aah!<br> Badder they are, bigger the reward!<br> Which brings me to you.<br> And I must admit that I'm at a bit of<br> a quandary when it comes to you.<br> On one hand, I despise slavery.<br> On the other hand<br> I need your help, if you're not<br> in a position to refuse, all the better.<br> So for the time being, I'm gonna make<br> this slave malarkey work to my benefit.<br> Still having said that<br> I feel guilty.<br> So<br> I would like the two of us<br> to enter into an agreement.<br> I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.<br> However I've had this endeavor,<br> I'm- I'm at a slight disadvantage,<br> in so far as, I don't<br> know what they look like.<br> But you do don't you?<br> I know what they look like, all right.<br> Good.<br> So here's my agreement.<br> You travel with me until we find them-<br> Where we goin'?<br> I hear at least two of them are overseeing<br> up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.<br> That means we visit every plantation<br> in Gatlinburg till we find them.<br> And when we find them<br> you point them out, and I kill them!<br> You do that, I agree to<br> give you your freedom,<br> twenty-five dollars per Brittle brother<br> -that's seventy-five dollars,<br> and as if on cue,<br> here comes the sheriff.<br> Okay boys, fun's over.<br> Come on out.<br> All right folks, calm down.<br> You bout your business.<br> The jokers will be gone soon.<br> Now<br> why y'all wanna come into<br> my town and start trouble,<br> and scare all these nice people?<br> You ain't got nothin' better to do,<br> than to come into Bill Sharp's<br> town and show your ass?<br> What did you jus' do to our sheriff?<br> Now you can get the marshall.<br> Marshall, marshall!<br> Should we wait inside?<br> Can't we just leave?<br> After you.<br> Move that buckboard long ways<br> 'cross the street from the saloon!<br> I want six men, six riffles behind it.<br> I want two men, two rifles<br> up on this roof,<br> two men two rifles on that roof.<br> All the barrels aimed at that front door.<br> Somebody git poor Bill<br> outta the goddamn street.<br> You in the saloon!<br> We got a hundred riffles aimed<br> on every way outta that buildin'!<br> You got once chance git outta this alive!<br> You and your nigger come out right now<br> with your hands over your head,<br> and I mean, right now!<br> Is this the marshall I have<br> the pleasure of addressing?<br> Yes it is.<br> This is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.<br> That wunderbar, marshall.<br> I have relieved myself of all weapons,<br> and just as you have instructed,<br> I am ready to step outside,<br> with my hands raised above my head.<br> I trust,<br> as a representative of the criminal justice<br> system of The United States of America,<br> I shan't be shot down in the street,<br> by either you or your deputies,<br> before I've had my day in court.<br> You mean like you did our sheriff?<br> Shot 'em down like a dog in the street!<br> Yes, that's exactly what I mean!<br> Do I have your word as a lawman,<br> not to shoot me down<br> like a dog in the street?<br> Well, as much as we'd all enjoy<br> seein' somethin' like that,<br> ain't nobody gonna cheat<br> the hangman in my town.<br> Fair enough marshall, here we come!<br> They're a little tense out there.<br> So don't make any quick movements,<br> and let me do the talking.<br> Come ahead.<br> You unarmed?<br> Yes indeed we are.<br> Marshall Tatum, may I address<br> you and your deputies,<br> and apparently the<br> entire town of Daughtrey,<br> as to the incident that just occurred?<br> Go on.<br> My name is Dr. King Schultz,<br> and like yourself, marshall,<br> I am a servant of the court.<br> The man lying dead in the dirt,<br> who the good people of Daughtrey<br> saw fit to elect as their sheriff,<br> who went by the name of Bill Sharp,<br> is actually a wanted outlaw<br> by the name of Willard Peck,<br> with a price on his<br> head of two hundred dollars.<br> Now, that's two hundred dollars,<br> dead or alive.<br> The hell you say!<br> I'm aware this is probably<br> disconcerting news.<br> But I'm willing to wager<br> this man was elected sheriff<br> sometime in the last two years.<br> I know this because three years ago,<br> he was rustling cattle from the B.C.<br> Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.<br> Now this is a warrant,<br> made out by circuit court Judge Henry<br> Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas.<br> You're encouraged to wire him.<br> He'll back up who I am,<br> and who your dear departed sheriff was.<br> In other words marshall,<br> you owe me two hundred dollars.<br> I'll be damned.<br> After this Brittle business<br> is behind us<br> you'll be a free man.<br> With a horse, seventy five<br> dollars in your back pocket.<br> What's your plan after that?<br> Find my wife<br> and buy her freedom.<br> Django<br> I had no idea you were a married man.<br> Do most slaves believe in marriage?<br> Me and my wife do.<br> All men in Carrucan did,<br> and that's why we uh<br> we run off.<br> Django<br> Django, Django<br> You got sand, Django.<br> Boy's got sand.<br> I got no use for niggers with sand.<br> I want you to burn the runaway r<br> right here on his cheek.<br> And the girl too.<br> And I want you to take 'em<br> to the Greenville auction,<br> and sell 'em<br> Both of 'em<br> Separately.<br> And this one<br> you will sell him cheap.<br> In Greenville?<br> There should be some<br> sort of a records office.<br> You know when she was sold<br> you know where she came from<br> and you know her name.<br> What is her name?<br> Broomhilda.<br> What?<br> Broom-hilda.<br> Broomhilda?<br> Hm-hm.<br> Were her owners German?<br> Yeah, how you know?<br> She wan't born on The Carrucan Plantation,<br> she was raised by a German mistress.<br> Von Shafts.<br> She speak a little German too.<br> Your wife?<br> Hm-hm.<br> When she was little, her mistress taught<br> her so she has somebody speak German with.<br> Alright, let me get this straight.<br> Your slave wife speaks German,<br> and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?<br> Yep.<br> They call me Hildi.<br> When we gain access to these plantations,<br> we'll be putting on an Act.<br> You'll be playing a character.<br> Hm?<br> No?<br> But during the act,<br> you can never break character.<br> D'you understand?<br> Yeah. Don't break character.<br> And you character is that of the Valet.<br> What that is?<br> That's a fancy word for servant.<br> Valet.<br> Hm-hm!<br> And now Django, you may chose<br> your character's costume.<br> You want that I pick up my own clothes?<br> You- but of course!<br> It's against the law for niggers<br> to ride horses in this territory.<br> This is my valet,<br> my valet does not walk.<br> I said niggers on horses-<br> His name is Django, he's a free man,<br> he can ride what he pleases.<br> Not on my property.<br> Not around my niggers he can't.<br> My good sir<br> perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.<br> Allow me to unring this bell.<br> My name is Dr. King Schultz,<br> this is my valet Django,<br> and these are our horses<br> Tony and Fritz.<br> Mr. Bennett,<br> I've been lead to believe that you are<br> a gentleman, and a business man.<br> And it is for these attributes<br> we've ridden from Texas<br> to Tennessee to<br> parley with you now.<br> I wish to purchase<br> one of your nigger gals.<br> You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to<br> Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals?<br> No appointment, no nuttin'?<br> Oh, I'm afraid so.<br> Well what if I had to say I don't<br> like you, or your fancy pants nigger,<br> and I wouldn't sell you a tinkers damn.<br> Now what'cha gotta say about that?<br> Mr. Bennett,<br> if you are the business man<br> I've been led to believe you to be,<br> I have five thousand things, I might<br> say, that could change your mind.<br> Well com'on inside, and get yourself<br> somethin' cool to drink.<br> Huh?<br> Hm-hm.<br> Oh maybe, while we discuss business,<br> you could provide one of<br> your loveliest black creatures<br> to escort Django here around<br> your magnificent grounds.<br> Oh, absolutely!<br> Eh, Betina!<br> Yessir, Big Daddy?<br> Eh What's your Jimmie name again?<br> Django.<br> Django.<br> Betina sugar, could you take Django there,<br> and take him around the grounds here<br> to show him all the pretty stuff.<br> As you please, Big Daddy.<br> Oh, Mr. Bennett,<br> I must remind you Django is a free man.<br> He cannot be treated like a slave.<br> Within the bounds of good taste, he must<br> be treated as an extension of myself.<br> Understood, Schultz.

You understand?<br> You can't treat him like any<br> of these other niggers around here,<br> cause he ain't like any of these<br> other niggers around here.

for the arrest and capture,<br> dead or alive, of<br> John Brittle, Roger Brittle,<br> and Ellis Brittle.<br> They've gone by the name Shaffer.<br> You know them by the name of Shaffer,<br> but the butchers real name was Brittle.<br> These are wanted men.<br> The law wants them for murder.<br> Now I reiterate,<br> the warrant states dead or alive,<br> so when Mr. Freeman and myself<br> executed these men on sight,<br> we were operating<br> within our legal boundaries.<br> I realize<br> passions are high,<br> but I must warn you,<br> the penalty for taking deadly force<br> against a office of the court<br> in the performance of his duty is,<br> you will be hung by the neck<br> until you're dead.<br> May I please remove the warrant<br> from my pocket so you may examine it?<br> Gimmie.<br> Satisfied?<br> May I have that back, please?<br> Get off my land.<br> Post haste.<br> Load up the bodies as quickly as you can,<br> and let's get out of here.<br> Hell<br> That's 'em sonsabitches.<br>

gotta killer nigger<br> over that hill there.<br> And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.<br> Okay, I'm confused.<br> Are the bags on or off.<br> I think we all think<br> the bags was a nice idea.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> But not pointing 'ny fingers,<br> they could have been done better.<br> So how about no bags this time,<br> but next time, we do the bags right,<br> and then we go full regalia.<br> I get my bag off.<br> Wait a minute!<br> I didn't say no bags.<br> But nobody can see.<br> So?<br> So, it be nice to see.<br> Goddamit! This is a raid!<br> I can't see, you can't see. So what?<br> All that matters is<br> can the fuckin' horse see!<br> That's a raid!<br> Where's this shit!<br> There he is!<br> Get that nigger out from under 'at wagon.<br> And get that nigger lover<br> out o'the wagon!<br> That nigger ain't down here!<br> They're gone!<br> What?<br> They tricked us!<br> Well where are they?<br> Auf wiedersehen.<br> Bull time.<br> We get 'em now.<br> Cowards tend to do that.<br> Goddammit!<br> Would you care to?<br> I can't see shit out of this<br> He's getting away.<br> I got 'em.<br> Big Daddy's getting away.<br> I got 'em.<br> Got 'em.<br> For kids, ain't that short.<br> How you know Broomhilda's<br> first masters were German?<br> Broomhilda is a German name.<br> If they named her, it stands<br> to reason they'd be German.<br> Lots of gals where you from<br> named Broomhilda?<br> Broomhilda is the name of a character<br> in the most popular<br> of all the German legends.<br> There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?<br> Oh yes, there is.<br> Do you know it?<br> Every German knows that story.<br> Would you like me to tell you?<br> Well<br> Broomhilda was a princess.<br> She was the daughter of Wotan,<br> the god of all gods.<br> Anyway, her father is really mad at her.<br> What she do?<br> I can't exactly remember.<br> I think she disobeys him in some way.<br> So he puts her on top of the mountain.<br> Broomhilda's on a mountain?<br> It's a German legend, there's always going<br> to be a mountain in there somewhere.<br> And he puts a fire breathing dragon<br> there to guard the mountain.<br> And he surrounds her<br> in a circle of hellfire.<br> And there, Broomhilda shall remain,<br> unless a hero arises<br> brave enough to save her.<br> Does a fella arise?<br> Yes Django. As a matter of fact, he does.<br> A fella named Sigfried.<br> Does Sigfried save her?<br> Quite spectacularly so.<br> He scales the mountain,<br> because he's not afraid of it.<br> He slays the dragon,<br> because he's not afraid of him.<br> And he walks through hellfire<br> because Broomhilda's worth it.<br> I know how he feel.<br> I think I'm just starting to realize that.<br> Now Look Django<br> I don't doubt that one day<br> you will save your lady love.<br> But I can't let you go to Greenville<br> in a good conscious.<br> Slave Washington, in Mississippi,<br> isn't a place for you to visit.<br> Free or not, it's just too dangerous.<br> But let me ask you a question.<br> How do you like the<br> bounty hunting business?<br> Kill white folks, and they pay you for it?<br> What's not to like?<br> And I have to admit, we make a good team.<br> I thought you was mad at me<br> for killin' Big John and Lit'le Raj?<br> Yeah, on that occasion,<br> you were a tad overzealous,<br> but normally, that's a good thing.<br> How'd you like to partner up<br> for the winter?<br> What'd ya mean partner up?<br> You work with me through<br> the winter till the snow melts.<br> I give you a third of my bounties.<br> So we make some money this winter,<br> and when the snow melts,<br> I'll take you to Greenville myself,<br> and we'll find where they sent your wife.<br> Why you care what happen to me?<br> Why you care if I find my wife?<br> Frankly<br> I've never given anybody<br> their freedom before.<br> And now that I have,<br> I feel vaguely responsible for you.<br> Plus when a German meets a real life<br> Sigfried, that's kind of a big deal.<br> As a German, I'm obliged to help you<br> on your quest to rescue<br> your beloved Broomhilda.<br> Ooh, what happened to mister<br> I wanna shoot white folks for money?<br> His son's with him.<br> Well good.<br> He'll have a loved one with him.<br> Maybe even share a last word.<br> That's better then most of them get,<br> and a damn sight better then he deserves.<br> Put down the rifle.<br> Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.<br> Just take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.<br> Read it aloud.<br> Consider that today's lesson.<br> Wanted, dead or alive.<br> Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall<br> gang.<br> For murder and stagecoach ro<br> robbery.<br> Seven zero zero ze-<br> Seven thousand.<br> Seven-<br> Thousand.<br> Seven thousand dollars for Smitty Bacall,<br> one thousand and five<br> hundred dollars for each of his gang<br> memb<br> members.<br> Known members of the Smitty<br> Bacall Gang are as fellows,<br> follows.<br> follows.<br> Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and<br> Crazy Craig Koons.<br> That is who Smitty Bacall is.<br> If Smitty Bacall wanted to<br> start a farm at twenty-two,<br> they would never have printed that.<br> But Smitty Bacall wanted<br> to rob stagecoaches,<br> and he didn't mind<br> killing people to do it.<br> D'you want to save your wife<br> by doing what I do?<br> This is what I do.<br> I kill people,<br> and sell their corpses for cash.<br> This corpse is worth<br> seven thousand dollars.<br> Now quit your pussyfootin'<br> and shoot him.<br> Pa?<br> Pa!<br> Here<br> You need to keep<br> this Smitty Bacall handbill.<br> Why?<br> It's good luck.<br> You always keep the handbill<br> of your first bounty.<br> That's accurate.<br> Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?<br> Who the hell have you got there?<br> The Wilson-Lowe Gang.<br> Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?<br> Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe,<br> and three of their acolytes.<br> Huh.<br> Well just leave 'em out here,<br> they ain't goin' nowhere.<br> Let's comin' outta the snowy snow and<br> git yourself some coffee.<br> Had a birthday yesterday, got some cake!<br> Pretty good.<br> Move along!<br> Do it, walk!<br> Keep moving.<br> Don't let that mud<br> slow you down, keep going.<br> Keep on.<br> Broomhilda Von Shaft, age twenty-seven,<br> r on right cheek<br> Calvin Candy.<br> He owns the fourth biggest cotton<br> plantation in Mississippi, Candyland.<br> Candyland?<br> Oh so you've heard of it?<br> Ain't no slave that ain't<br> heard of Candyland.<br> Well, apparently that's where you wife is,<br> and that's the repelling<br> gentleman who owns her.<br> Let's just hope she works in the out,<br> slaying in the field.<br> Oh no, she ain't in the field, mate.<br> She she pretty.<br> and she a tall girl, too.<br> The one you tore back up on the nag<br> he burnt her runaway on her cheek.<br> They got damned.<br> She no field nigger, but she ain't good<br> enough for the house no more either.<br> They're gonna try to make<br> her comfort girl.<br> What's a comfort-<br> Oh.<br> Now while I got freedom<br> Now while I got my gun.<br> So do we offer to buy her?<br> So<br> say<br> a man wants to buy a horse<br> needs to buy a horse.<br> He walks up to the farmer's farm,<br> he knocks on the farmer's door,<br> and asks the farmer to buy his horse.<br> And you know what the farmer says,<br> the farmer says: No.<br> Well I say: fuck that farmer.<br> And I'm stealin' that horse.<br> Fair enough, but now you are horse thief,<br> and they hang horse thieves.<br> Not to mention the horse<br> goes back to its original owner,<br> because the horse is still its property.<br> We need her and we need a bill of sale.<br> But if we ain't gonna try to buy,<br> then how we gonna get it?<br> May I offer an alternative<br> plan for action?<br> Go ahead.<br> The man walks up to the farmer's farm,<br> he knocks on the farmer's door,<br> and asks not to buy the horse,<br> but the farm,<br> and makes an offer so ridiculous,<br> the farmer's forced to say yes.<br> We're gonna offer to buy Candyland?<br> No, it's far too big, but apparently,<br> this farmer ain't all about the farm.<br> How much do you know<br> about mandingo fighting?<br> What?<br> Can you convincingly masquerade of someone<br> who's an expert on mandingo fighting?<br> Why?<br> Because my character is that of<br> a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,<br> here in Greenville to buy my way<br> into the mandingo fight game,<br> and your character is the mandingo<br> expert I hired to help me do it.<br> They call that One-Eyed Charly.<br> Bonjour.<br> Bonsoir, p'tite femme noire,<br> we are here to see Mr. Calvin Candy.<br> Enter.<br> Thank

boarding school together.<br> Calvins' father father<br> put me through law school.<br> One could almost say, I was<br> raised to be Calvin's lawyer.<br> One could almost say, you's a nigger.<br> What did you say?<br> I say<br> Real nothing, he's just being cheeky.<br> Now, anything else about Mr. Candie<br> that I should know before I meet him?<br> Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.<br> Ah, what civilized people aren't?<br> And he prefers Monsieur<br> Candie to Mister Candie.<br> Hmm, si c'est cela qu'il prfre.<br> He doesn't speak French. Don't speak<br> French to him, it'll embarrass him.<br> Get back on top now, turn around.<br> There you go.<br> There you go.<br> Why do you want to get<br> in the mandingo business?<br> You don't intend to allow your second<br> to make the proper introductions?<br> Quit stalling now.<br> Answer the question.<br> The awful truth?<br> Pff, I'm bored.<br> This seems like a good bit of fun.<br> Well, come on over.<br> We got us a fight goin' on,<br> that's a good bit of fun.<br> Won't you accompany me to the bar?<br> You don't go ahead in a house,<br> white man, even I know that.<br> Dr. Schultz<br> What a real pleasure-<br> Keep fighting, niggers!<br> .. and I might add, an honor.<br> Honored to meet you, please have a seat,<br> the pleasure's all mine.<br> Get Freeman Django here whatever he wants.<br> And I'll have sweet gin bourbon.<br> You go way, boy,<br> you do what I tell you!<br> He's got big and strong!<br> Com'on now!<br> Ah, he's not doing what I told him.<br> For God sake.<br> Bravo, Luigi, cosi e dai.<br> De casse piu rapido.<br> Com'on now boys,<br> this a fight to the death!<br> Hit that animal or you're ain't!<br> Ecco i con la spola tappeto.<br> La spola tappeto gi.<br> Big Fred, com'on!<br> Turn him around, now!<br> Use your strength, boy!<br> Com'on now, use your strength!<br> There you go!<br> There you go!<br> Look at that!<br> Yeah I told you, this is a wild man.<br> Do what I told you, boy.<br> Here you go!<br> Ah.

Come here!<br> Get over there, get her cleaned up,<br> bring her back over here to doctor<br> what- what did you say<br> your name is, Schut?<br> Schultz.<br> Schultz!<br> Git her back over here, alright girl?<br> Yes sir.<br> Hilda, you comin with me, or you<br> gonna sleep in that lit'le box over here?<br> Hello ladies.<br> Dr. Schultz, may I introduce<br> to you Broomhilda.<br> Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.<br> It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.<br> I've heard a lot of good things about you.<br> Well, it's not often a nigger<br> speaks German, don't you know?<br> As I look at you now, Broomhilda,<br> I could see all the passion<br> you inspire completely justified.<br> The doctor here speaks German!<br> And I've been informed you do as well?<br> Go ahead girl, speak a little German.<br> Astonishing.<br> And I should bring-<br> Much obliged.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Pardon.<br> Hey Little Trouble Maker.<br> You silver tongued devil you.<br> Look Monsieur Candie, they were<br> all fine specimens, no doubt about it.<br> But the best three, by far, were:<br> Sampson<br> Well, what's his name again?<br> Goldie.<br> Goldie and Eskimo Joe.<br> By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?<br> Oh, you never know how these<br> nigger nicknames get started.<br> His name was Joe, maybe one day<br> he said he was cold, who knows?<br> Well, regardless,<br> Samson's your best,<br> we all know that,<br> you will never sell him,<br> and I can see why, he's a champion.<br> Hm-hm-hm!<br> All three are champions.<br> Samson's champion.<br> Them other two pretty good.<br> Calvin, what that nigger- you let-<br> That's alright, that's alright.<br> You have to understand Monsieur Candie,<br> while admittedly a neophyte<br> in the nigger fight game,<br> I do have a little bit of a background<br> in the European traveling circus.<br> Is that right?<br> Hence I have big ideas<br> when it comes to presentation.<br> I need something<br> more than just a big nigger.<br> He needs to have panache.<br> Need to have what what what?<br> Panache, hum<br> A sense of showmanship!<br> Showmanship, yes.<br> I want to be able to bill him<br> him as the Black Hercules.<br> Black Hercules, isn't that clever?<br> More like niggerly.<br> I said, and I quote:<br> I would pay top dollar<br> for the Right Nigger.<br> Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe<br> is the wrong nigger per se<br> but is he right as rain?<br> Dr. Schultz,<br> I will have you know,<br> there is no one in the nigger<br> fight game that appreciates<br> the value of showmanship more<br> than Monsieur Calvin J. Candie.<br> Nobody.<br> But one must not forget the most<br> important thing in the nigger fight game.<br> And that is a nigger that can win fights.<br> Now that should be your first, second,<br> third, four, and fifth concern.<br> Now after you have that,<br> and you know you have that,<br> then you can start to<br> implement a grand design.<br> In other words, first thing is first.<br> First thing is first.<br> I see you two gettin' on.<br> Famously.<br> Oh Monsieur Candie, you can't<br> imagine what it's like<br> not to hear you native<br> tongue in four years.<br> Well hell, I can't imagine<br> two weeks in Boston.<br> Two weeks in Boston,<br> oh that's your- oh man!<br> Ah, two weeks in Boston!<br> I can't express the joy I felt<br> conversing in my mother tongue.<br> And Hildi is a charming<br> conversation companion.<br> Ah be careful now Doctor Schultz,<br> you might have caught yourself<br> a little dose of Nigella.<br> Nigella's a powerful emotion, boy.<br> It's like a pool of black tar,<br> once it catches your ass, you can't-<br> Yessir, you can't.<br> I don't know doctor, you can lay on all<br> the German sweet talk you want, but<br> it looks like this pony's<br> got big eyes for Django.<br> Well naturally, it is the soaring eagle<br> that attracts her attention,<br> not the plucked chicken.<br> Dr. Schultz, don't be<br> so down on yourself,<br> you are quite a dapper European gentleman.<br> You gotta finish this, you got to put your<br> elbow in this, this is, do you hear me-<br> You know that nigger, don't ya?<br> Who?<br> Who?<br> Don't who me bitch,<br> you know who I'm talking about!?<br> At the table?<br> I don't know him.<br> You don't know him?<br> No.<br> No what?<br> No sir.<br> You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?<br> Okay<br> If- if you say so.<br> Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,<br> no doubt about it.<br> But if it was my money<br> I wouldn't pay no twelve<br> thousand dollars for him.<br> What would your price be?<br> Well, if I was inclined to be generous,<br> and I don't know why I would<br> be inclined to be generous<br> nine thousand<br> maybe.<br> Dr. Schultz<br> Let me reclarify how this<br> whole negotiation came about.<br> You see, it wasn't me who came<br> to you to sell a nigger,<br> Sure, it wasn't.<br> It was you who approached me to buy one.<br> Sure it was.<br> Now that nine thousand dollar<br> figure Bright Boy was banding about,<br> that ain't too far off from right,<br> and if I wanted to sell<br> Eskimo Joe for that,<br> I could do so any day of the week.<br> Any day.<br> But like you said in Greenville doctor,<br> I don't wanna sell 'em.<br> It was only your<br> ridiculous offer<br> of twelve thousand dollars<br> that made me even consider it.<br> Hmm-hmm.<br> You know Monsieur Candie,<br> you do possess the power of persuasion.<br> Why not, Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,<br> Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!<br> Hurray, doctor, hurray,<br> and a wise decision, that is!<br> However, that is a tremendous<br> amount of money.<br> And the way you have your Mr. Moguy,<br> I have a lawyer,<br> a persnickety man named Tuttle,<br> And I would need my Mr. Tuttle<br> to draw up a legal contract<br> before I'd feel comfortable exchanging<br> that amount of money for flesh.<br> Not to mention having Eskimo Joe<br> examined by a physician of my choosing.<br> Naturally.<br> So say I return in about<br> .. five days time.<br> Five days ?!<br> With my Mr. Tuttle.<br> And then my Mr. Tuttle<br> and your Mr. Moguy can hash out<br> the finer details between themselves.<br> I say splendid Doctor<br> Splendid.<br> Gentlemen<br> may I propose a toast<br> to Eskimo Joe.<br> Or, shall we call him<br> the Black Hercules.<br> To the Black Hercules.<br> The Black Hercules!<br> The Black Hercules<br> You was right, Doctor,<br> that name do help pay an ass.<br> Hildi<br> I'm outta drink, girl.<br> So Hildi how you like servin'<br> at the big table in the big house, huh?<br> When Monsieur Candy talk to you,<br> you answers.<br> I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.<br> Hmm-hmm.<br> It's a lot better than<br> sizzling in that hot box,<br> or draggin' your ass<br> through a bramble bush.<br> Maybe it's not quite as much fun as<br> getting the pleasure o' the mandingos,<br> huh sugar babe?<br> Hmm oh, she like them new.<br> Like Simpson, huh?<br> Yessir.<br> You know Monsieur Candie,<br> Hmm?<br> the doctor here might be interested<br> in seein' Hildi's peeled back,<br> since how they don't have<br> many niggers where he come from.<br> Dr. Schultz, when you<br> was alone with Hildi here,<br> did- didja just speak German, or<br> did ya git her clothes off?<br> No, we just talked and<br> Oh so- so you haven't seen her back?<br> I haven't-<br> No no no, now Steven's right,<br> you might find this interesting.<br> Hildi, com'on take off your dress,<br> show Dr. Schultz your back here, go on!<br> Uh, Calvin, I just got her all<br> dressed up and looking nice.<br> But Lara Lee, Dr. Schultz is from<br> Dusseldorf,they don't got niggers there.<br> He's a man of medicine.<br> I'm sure it would fascinate him,<br> the niggers endurance for pain.<br> These niggers are tough<br> Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.<br> Hilda's got somethin' like<br> four lashes on her back.<br> Lare Lee, just get-<br> why don't you lose her goddamn mat?<br> Look a' that, doctor, it's like<br> a painting, look at that.<br> Calvin!<br> We are eating, ain't no one<br> wanna look at her whipped up back!<br> Fine. Fine, fine fine fine<br> After the dinner, Steven.<br> After dinner.<br> During the brandies, gentlemen. Uh?<br> Cora, come get this girl!<br> She all messed.<br> Yes ma'am?<br> Oh! Why are you all undone?<br> I just got you done,<br> now come over, here!<br> Baby, you got Steven his bad side,<br> when you need to be on his blind side.<br> You said you ain't know him?<br> Huh?<br> I said you said you ain't know him.<br> I don't.<br> Yes you do.<br> Mister Steven<br> I don't.<br> Why is you lyin' to me?<br> I ain't.<br> Then why is you cry?<br> You scarin' me.<br> Why is I'm scarin' you?<br> Because you scary.<br> .. to speak German this afternoon<br> with Hildi, was positively soul enriching.<br> You stay in that chair.<br> You indicated earlier<br> you'd be willing to part with Hildi.<br> Oh yes.<br> Yesiree Bob I did.<br> In that case allow me<br> to propose another proposition.<br> I'm all ears.<br> Hurry up, goddammit!<br> Monsieur Candie-<br> Steven!<br> You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here!<br> Uhm sorry doctor Schultz,<br> my ears ain't worth a damn these days.<br> Monsieur Candie, could I get<br> a word with you in the kitchen.<br> You mean get up outta my chair?<br> If you could manage it.<br> Why?<br> It's about dessert.<br> What about dessert?<br> I'd rather discuss that in private.<br> We're havin' white cake.<br> What sort of melodrama<br> could be brewing back there?<br> You right Monsieur Candy, you right,<br> I'll handle it myself.<br> Meet me in the library.<br> I just can't understand why<br> you won't come talk to the evening,<br> she get fucked up 'round here,<br> you blame me.<br> Fine, fine friend Steven, I<br> will be along momentarily.<br> Yessir.<br> Well<br> gentlemen<br> as you can see, talented as they are<br> no doubt in the kitchen,<br> from time to time<br> adult supervision is required.<br> If you'll excuse me a moment.<br> You may clear the dinner service.<br> Hurry up girl.<br> So Dr. Schultz<br> Why don't you regal us<br> with the tale of the circus?<br> The circus!<br> What is the matter?<br> Them motherfuckers ain't here<br> to buy no mandingos.<br> They wants that girl.<br> Steven, what the hell<br> are you talkin' about, hm?<br> They playin' your ass for a fool,<br> that what I'm talkin' bout.<br> They ain't here for<br> no muscle bound jimmie,<br> they here for that girl.<br> What what girl.<br> What Hildi?<br> Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django?<br> Them niggers know each other.<br> He he just bought Eskimo Joe.<br> Did he give you any money?<br> No, not yet, but they go-<br> Then he didn't buy diddly,<br> not yet no how.<br> But he's just about to buy who he come<br> here to buy, when I interrupted him.<br> Thank you Steven.<br> You're welcome Calvin.<br> Whe- where you gettin' all this?<br> Why would they go through all<br> that trouble for a nigger with a-<br> with a chewed up back,<br> ain't worth three hundred dollars?<br> They're doin' it cause that nigger<br> Django's in love with Hildi.<br> She probably his wife.<br> Now, why that German give a fuck who that<br> uppity son-of-a-bitch is in love with,<br> I'm sure I don't know.<br> If she's who they want<br> why this whole snake oil<br> pitch about mandingos in?<br> You wouldn't pay no never mind<br> into three hundred dollar.<br> But that twelve thousand?<br> That made you real friendly now, didn'it?<br> Yes it did.<br> His wife, uh?<br> If it had been a snake<br> we would have beat'em.<br> Those lyin' goddamn time<br> wastin' sonsabitches.<br> Sonsabitches!<br> .. out of New Orleans, so I had quite<br> a bit of practice with theaters types.<br> Oh there you are!<br> I was beginning to think that you<br> and that old crow ran off together.<br> That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?<br> Lara Lee<br> I was just lookin' out the big window.<br> Billy Crash is out there dealin' with some<br> shady slaver try n' sellin'<br> a passel of ponys,<br> would you be a dear and go out<br> there give them gals an eyeball.<br> Of course, brother.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> Okay. Business never sleeps.<br> A propos<br> before your exit, we were discussing the<br> possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.<br> Ah yes! Yes we would.<br> And we will again in a moment.<br> Who is your little friend?<br> This is Ben<br> He's a Ol'Joe that<br> lived around here for a long time.<br> And I do mean a long damn time.<br> Well Ben here<br> took care of my daddy<br> and my daddy's daddy<br> till the open kill doe who one day<br> who been took care o'me.<br> Growin'up the son of a of a<br> huge plantation owner in Mississippi<br> puts a white men in contact with<br> a whole lot o' black faces.<br> I spent my whole life here<br> right here in Candyland<br> surrounded by black faces.<br> And seein' them ev'ry day,<br> day in day out, I<br> I only had one question.<br> Why don't they kill us?<br> Now right up there on that porch<br> three times a week for fifty years,<br> Ol'Ben here would shave<br> my Daddy with a straight razor.<br> Now if I was Ol'Ben, I would<br> have cut my Daddy's goddamn throat,<br> and it wouldn't have taken me<br> no fifty years to do it neither.<br> But he never did.<br> Why not?<br> You see<br> the science of analogy<br> is crucial to understandin' the<br> separation about two species.<br> In the skull of the African here<br> the area associated with submissiveness<br> is larger than any human or any other<br> sup human species on planet earth.<br> If you examine<br> this peace of skull here<br> you'll notice three distinct dimples.<br> Here here and here.<br> Now<br> If I was holding a skull of a- of a<br> of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,<br> these three dimples would be found in the<br> area o'the skull most associated with<br> creativity.<br> ut th' th kull f l'n.<br> And in the skull of Ol'Ben,<br> unburden by genes,<br> these three dimples exist in the area<br> of the skull most associated with<br> servility.<br> Now Bright Boy<br> I will admit you are pretty clever.<br> But if I took this hammer here<br> and I bashed it in your skull<br> you would have the same three dimples.<br> in the same place<br> as Ol'Ben.<br> Now lay your palms flat on the table top!<br> If you lift those palms off<br> that turtle shell table top,<br> Mr. Butch is gonna let loose with<br> both barrels of that sawed off!<br> There have been a latta lies said<br> around this diner table here tonight,<br> but that you can believe!<br> Mr. Moguy,<br> would you be so kind as to collect the<br> pistol hangin' on those boys hips here?<br> Thank you ever so much.<br> Doctor.<br> Where were we?<br> Jackass.<br> Oh yes<br> I do believe you were just getting ready<br> to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.<br> I am right?<br> Right then.<br> Bring out Hildi!<br> Your way, honey.<br> Sit your ass in that goddamn chair!<br> Lay your hands flat on that table.<br> And shut your mouth!<br> Dr. Schultz in Greenville,<br> you yourself said,<br> that for the Right Nigger<br> you'd be willing to pay<br> what some may consider<br> is a ridiculous amount.<br> To which, me myself said,<br> What is your definition of ridiculous?,<br> to which you said,<br> Twelve thousand dollars.<br> Now considering you all have<br> ridden a whole lotta miles,<br> went to a whole<br> lotta trouble,<br> and done spread a whole lotta bull,<br> to purchase this lovely lady right here,<br> it would appear that Broomhilda<br> is in fact the Right Nigger!<br> And if y'all wanna leave<br> Candyland with Broomhilda<br> the price is twelve thousand dollars.<br> And I take it you prefer the take it<br> or leave it style of negotiating?<br> Yes I do, doctor.<br> You see, under the laws of Chickasaw<br> County, Broomhilda here is my property.<br> And I can chose to do with<br> my property whatever I so desire!<br> And if you all think my price<br> for this nigger here is too steep,<br> what I'm gonna desire to do is<br> take this fuckin' hammer here,<br> and beat her ass to death with it!<br> Right in front of both y'all!<br> Ain't it good, fella?<br> Then we can examine the three<br> dimples inside Broomhilda skull!<br> Now!<br> What's it gonna be, Doc?<br> Huh?<br> What's it gonna be?<br> May I lift the hands off the table<br> top in order to remove my billfold?<br> Yes you may.<br> That twelve.<br> Sold!<br> To the man with the exceptional beard,<br> and his unexceptional nigger.<br> Mr. Moguy.<br> Yes Calvin?<br> You make this gentleman a receipt<br> for twelve thousand dollar, please.<br> Twelve thousand dollar.<br> Hm.<br> It was a pleasure doin'<br> business with ya all.<br> Now gentlemen<br> If you care to join me in the parlor<br> we will be serving white cake.<br> Well done, Calvin.<br> Excuse me<br> Excuse me, madam?<br> Could you please stop playing Beethoven?<br> Take your hands off that harp!<br> Doctor!<br> Doc, you can't go in there!<br> Hey uh, Steven, hey!<br> He got no business goin' in there.<br> Let it be.<br> He's a little upset, that's all.<br> I'll handle this.<br> White cake?<br> I don't go in for sweets, thank you.<br> You brooding 'bout me<br> getting the best of ya, uh?<br> Actually, I was thinking of that<br> poor devil you fed to the dogs today.<br> D'Artagnan.<br> And I was wondering what<br> Dumas would make of all this.<br> Come again?<br> Alexandre Dumas.<br> He wrote The Three Musketeers.<br> Yes of course, doctor.<br> I figured you must be an admirer,<br> you named your slave after<br> his novel's lead character.<br> Now if Alexandre Dumas<br> had been there today,<br> I wonder what he would have made of it?<br> You doubt he'd approve?<br> Yes, his approval would be<br> a dubious proposition at best.<br> Soft hearted Frenchy?<br> Alexandre Dumas is black.<br> Are these Broomhilda's papers?<br> Yes they are.<br> May I?<br> Of course!<br> Thank you.<br> I dealt- her bill of sale of ownership is<br> written of course a freedom papers, doctor.<br> Would you have ink and pen for me?<br> Right over there, on that little table.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Broomhilda Von Shaft<br> consider yourself a free woman.<br> Mister Candy<br> Normally, I would say auf wiedersehen.<br> But since what auf wiedersehen<br> actually means is till I see you again,<br> and since I never wish<br> to see you again, to you sir,<br> I say good bye.<br> Let's go.<br> Com'on.<br> One more moment, Doctor!<br> What?<br> It's a custom here in the South,<br> once a business deal is concluded<br> that the two parties<br> shake hands.<br> It implies good faith.<br> I'm

y'all.<br> We found your wanted posters<br> and book of figures in your saddle bags.<br> I gotta say<br> I ain't never heard of no<br> black bounty hunter before.<br> A black boy paid to kill white men,<br> how d'you like that line of work?<br> Prob'bly pretty good while it lasted, uh?<br> Time to say goodnight to them nuts, black.<br> On three<br> One<br> I got you.<br> Two<br> Calm down

o'ways to kill your ass.<br> Now mind ya, most of 'dem ideas had<br> to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.<br> Now, that may seem like<br> a good idea, but truth is<br> when you snip a nigger's nuts,<br> most of 'em bleed out, know 'bout<br> seven minutes, most of 'em<br> More than most.<br> Then I say is<br> Hells bells<br> the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey,<br> got it worse then that.<br> And they're still sayin'<br> Let's whip 'em to death,<br> Dump 'em to the mandingos,<br> Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs.<br> And I say, What's so special 'bout that?<br> We do that shit all the time!<br> Hells bells, the niggers we sell to<br> LeQuint Dickey got it worse then that.<br> Low and behold, out of nowhere,<br> miss Lara come up with the bright idea<br> of givin' your ass to the LeQuint<br> Dickey Mining Company.<br> And as a slave of the LeQuint<br> Dickey Mining Company,<br> hence forth, till the day you die,<br> all day, ev'ryday,<br> you will be swingin' a sledgehammer,<br> turning big rocks into little rocks.<br> Now when you get there,<br> they gonna take away your name,<br> give you a number, and a sledgehammer,<br> and say get to work.<br> One word of says,<br> they cuts out your tongue,<br> they's good at that too,<br> you won't believe that.<br> Ooh, they does that for you.<br> They gonna work you, all day,<br> ev'ry day, till your back give up.<br> Then they gonna hit you<br> in the head with the hammer,<br> tow your ass down<br> the nigger hole.<br> And that will be the story end<br> for you, Django.<br> Hey, white boy<br> I said: hey, white boy!<br> Shut up, black, you ain't got<br> nothing to say I wanna hear.<br> How'd you like to make<br> eleven thousand dollars?<br> D'you ain't hear?<br> I said, how d'you like to make<br> eleven thousand dollars?<br> Eleven thousand five hundred, actually.<br> What the fuck are you talking about?<br> Back there at that plantation Candyland,<br> there was an eleven thousand five<br> hundred dollar fortune,<br> just sittin' there,<br> and y'all rode right past it.<br> You be damned, blackie,<br> we're not bandits.<br> I ain't sayin' that, nice thing<br> 'bout this fortune it is.<br> It ain't illegal,<br> you can't steal it,<br> ya gotta earn it, white boy.<br> You got something to say,<br> mate, you say it.<br> The eleven thousand five hundred dollar<br> fortune waiting for you back at Candyland,<br> is in the form of a wanted<br> dead or alive bounty<br> on Smitty Bacall,<br> and the Bacall Gang.<br> Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?<br> Smitty Bacall is the leader of this<br> murdering gang of stagecoach robbers,<br> the Bacall Gang.<br> There's a seven thousand dollar<br> wanted dead or alive bounty on him,<br> one thousand five hundred dollars<br> for each of his three accomplices.<br> Dandy Michaels,<br> Gerald Nash,<br> Crazy Craig Koons.<br> Now all four o'them gentlemen,<br> they're back there at Candyland,<br> laughin' their ass off.<br> You know why?<br> Cause they just got away with murder.<br> But it ain't got to be that way.<br> You and your mate, young rabbit<br> and Yango get that money.<br> What these jokers do again?<br> These sonofabitch, they-<br> they killed innocent people.<br> Stagecoach robbery.<br> Innocent white people!<br> I got the handbill right here<br> in my pocket if you let me get it.<br> Get it here.<br> Wanted dead or alive Smitty Bacall<br> and the Smitty Bacall gang.<br> But you're a slave!<br> I ain't no goddamn slave!<br> Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?<br> - 7000 dollars for Smitty Bacall<br> This is a shit load!<br> I'm a bounty hunter.<br> Yesterday, as a free man,<br> I rode in the Candyland,<br> on a horse, with my German<br> white partner, Dr. King Schultz.<br> We tracked the Bacall gang all the way<br> from Texas, to Chikasaw County.<br> We finally found their ass<br> laying low at Candyland.<br> We went in there to get 'em,<br> things went sour,<br> my partner got killed,<br> Calvin Candie got shot.<br> Then ev'rybody there decided<br> to blame me, so here I am.<br> But Django ain't on that manifest,<br> and all o'you know I ain't<br> supposed to be on this trip.<br> But them four men are still back there,<br> they're still wanted,<br> and that eleven thousand<br> five hundred is up for grabs,<br> and the last thing they'd expect<br> is y'all ridin' back and gittin' it.<br> What's the deal?<br> You tell us who they are<br> and we turn you lose?<br> I ain't tellin' who they are.<br> Look, you give me a pistol,<br> one o'them horses,<br> and five hundred dollars of that<br> eleven thousand five hundred,<br> and I'll point 'em out to you.<br> This a real handbill.<br> Ah jus'cause it's a real handbill's doesn't<br> mean that other bunch o'malarky is.<br> Now why would a slave have a wanted<br> dead or alive handbill in his pocket?<br> Ain't that black ridin' into<br> Candyland yesterday?<br> Alright<br> I'm gonna ask you again<br> I want you to remember I don't like liars.<br> Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in<br> with a white man on horse yesterday?<br> Yeah.<br> They walked us from<br> the Greenville Auction and<br> he rode in on a horse<br> with a white man.<br> And this white man<br> was the black his slave?<br> He weren't no slave.<br> You- you fuckin' sure about that?<br> Damn sure.<br> What happened over at Candyland?<br> Bunch of shootin'<br> master got shot.<br> Who shot 'em?<br> The German.<br> Why did he do that?<br> The nigger and the German was actin'<br> like they were slavers, but they weren't.<br> Well, what were they?<br> Bounty hunters.<br> Fuck me Roy, I mean this-<br> this could be big, mate!<br> Well, smoke<br> you gotta deal.<br> I got one more condition.<br> What is that?<br> When we get there<br> when the time come<br> you let me help you kill 'em.<br> You're a funny bugger!<br> Get him loose.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> You got yourself a deal, blackie.<br> You got yourself a deal, mate.<br> You alright for a black fella!<br> Oh yeah!<br> Jeez<br> There ya go<br> There ya go, mate.<br> For you, we'll give you<br> that pack horse over here.<br> What's them saddle bags got in?<br> Dynamite.<br> I ain't ridin' no horse with no<br> goddamn dynamite on his back.<br> I can understand that.<br> Frankie, we take 'em sticks off that<br> horse, and stick 'em in the nigger cage.<br> A little dynamite for you<br> black ass to play with!<br> Hey Floyd, you got that rifle<br> on the wagon, don't you?<br> Yeah, alright.<br> Don't you give 'em<br> your gun and gun belt.<br> Now, don't drop the<br> fucking thing, alright?<br> I just had the sights fixed,<br> and that perfect.<br> Uh, that's good to know.<br> Throw me up that dynamite.<br> Jake!<br> Yeah?<br> You gotta try to see what's goin'on<br> with that goddamn dog!<br> Go to hell, you motherfucker!<br> Love you too, son.<br> It's me, baby.<br> In the sweet<br> byin' bye<br> we will leave<br> on that beautiful song.<br> Byin' bye bye bye<br> we

Calvin and the byin bye.<br> Just a bit sooner<br> than ya'all was expectin'.<br> Billy Crash!<br> Now why would?<br> Oh, that's right.<br> Last time I seen you,<br> you had your hands on my<br> Django!<br> You back, sonofabitch!<br> To dear son, hey Billy.<br> Oh no!<br> Now, all o'you black folks, I suggest<br> you get away from all these white folks.<br> Not you Steven.<br> You're right where you belong.<br> Uh, Cora, before you go<br> would you tell miss Lara goodbye?<br> Do- do what now?<br> I said tell miss Lara goodbye.<br> Bye miss Lara.<br> Ya'all two run along now.<br>
