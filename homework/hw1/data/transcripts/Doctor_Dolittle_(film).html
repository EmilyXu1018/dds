Own up. Who's got it<br> this time? Who's got my dinner?<br> It's bad enough to have to eat<br> this muck in the first place.<br> Just 'cause I eat this<br> instead of eating them,<br> they think they can<br> take advantage of me.<br> You've no idea what I put up with<br> on their account.<br> [Music] I eat every flowering shrub<br> there is except for gorse [music]<br> [Music] Sometimes I get luxuries<br> like beetroot leaves, of course [music]<br> [Music] My life's much the same<br> as that of any English horse [music]<br> [Music] Why should I be a vegetarian [music]<br> [Music] Turnip pie and peanuts<br> That's the sort of filth I eat [music]<br> [Music] Any sort of rubbish<br> that is wholesome and discreet [music]<br> [Music] Why don't I admit<br> that my hypocrisy's complete [music]<br> [Music] If I should live<br> to be a centenarian [music]<br> [Music] Become our most adored<br> humanitarian [music]<br> [Music] I'll never make<br> a decent vegetarian [music]<br> [Music] I'm a cheat, I love meat [music]<br> [Music] I'm a cheat, yes, I am [music]<br> [Music] I love red-blooded<br> juicy chunks of meat [music]<br> [Music] Legs of lamb, sides of beef [music]<br> [Music] And chops and steaks<br> and veal and pork, of course [music]<br> - [Music] My favorite meal [music]<br> - [Squealing]<br> [Music] And then I hear<br> poor Gub-Gub squeal [music]<br> [Music] Oh, me, oh, my [music]<br> [Music] A reluctant but sincere [music]<br> [Music] Vegetarian [music]<br> [Music] Am I [music]<br> So, you see, Stubbins,<br> being an animal doctor has its problems.<br> For one thing, you don't get paid<br> anything, at least not in money.<br> You get bones<br> or nuts or worms...<br> or whatever the particular<br> animal's currency happens to be.<br> And secondly, most of the animals who<br> come here as patients like it so much,<br> they stay here permanently.<br> It's hardly what you'd call<br> a profit-making enterprise.<br> But who looks after<br> the animals?<br> They look after themselves,<br> for the most part.<br> Animals are much better<br> at that than human beings.<br> And how did you become a veteran?<br> [Chuckles] No, Stubbins,<br> the word is "veterinarian."<br> But say "animal doctor."<br> It's less pretentious.<br> It all happened<br> rather suddenly, actually.<br> My entire life changed in one day,<br> didn't it, Matthew?<br> [Chuckles]<br> Oh, it was altogether marvelous.<br> It was my sister, Sarah,<br> who started it all.<br> Sarah.<br> - [Clucking]<br> - [Gasping]<br> - [Quacks]<br> - Oh!<br> [Whimpering]<br> Did you know that an ant has<br> more intelligence than a hippopotamus?<br> And that a grasshopper...<br> in relation to his size...<br> has more power in his hind legs<br> than a kangaroo?<br> Absolutely fascinating.<br> There's no doubt about it. Animals<br> are much more interesting than people.<br> Good heavens, Sarah.<br> What on Earth are you doing down there?<br> There are pigeons<br> in the linen cupboard.<br> - Oh, yes, I thought<br> it would be warmer for them.<br> - You knew?<br> Yes, I put them there. It gets<br> so terribly chilly on the roof at night.<br> And two tortoises<br> in the guest room.<br> That's where they are.<br> I wondered where they got to.<br> - And white mice<br> in your chest of drawers.<br> - That's right.<br> And the grass snakes are<br> in the roll top desk under the envelopes.<br> Grass snakes?<br> John Dolittle, if those animals<br> aren't out of this house by tonight...<br> - [Bell Rings]<br> - Oh, dear!<br> - [Bell Ringing]<br> - Nine o'clock precisely.<br> That will be Lady Petherington.<br> I wonder what she's found wrong<br> with herself today.<br> All right, Sarah.<br> Show her in, please.<br> I mean it, John.<br> I shall leave.<br> Those animals,<br> they're destroying your practice.<br> You won't have<br> a decent patient left soon.<br> Not unless you answer the door.<br> I don't understand the things that go on<br> around this house with those animals.<br> And we'll probably never see<br> the vicar's wife again...<br> after giving her that glass of milk<br> with a frog in it.<br> - [Bell Rings]<br> - [Sniffles]<br> I really don't know<br> what you expect me to do.<br> Oh, good morning,<br> Lady Petherington.<br> Are we feeling better today?<br> We're no better for being left to freeze<br> to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.<br> Oh.<br> Dr. Dolittle,<br> oh, it's my nerves.<br> You must do something<br> for them instantly.<br> Oh, you'll never guess<br> what happened.<br> It's quite the worst<br> experience of my life.<br> Uh, won't you come in,<br> Lady Petherington?<br> I was giving<br> this dinner party last night...<br> up at the Grange<br> for the Duke of St. Albans.<br> Fifty guests. The most<br> embarrassing moment of my entire life.<br> A mouse ran across the table.<br> Oh, I thought I'd die.<br> I may still.<br> Can you imagine? A mouse.<br> Do you know who was there, hmm?<br> Well, of course, everybody.<br> The humiliation.<br> Crown Prince Angelicus<br> of Brandenberg.<br> He's so well-bred,<br> he doesn't even know what a mouse is.<br> Fainted dead away.<br> I haven't slept all night.<br> Of course, I discharged<br> my entire staff,<br> especially the gardeners.<br> I'll be struck<br> from the social directory.<br> A mouse. Hmph.<br> [Doorbell Ringing]<br> - Vicar, what a surprise!<br> - [Sneezes] Bless me.<br> How is your frog?<br> I mean, your wife.<br> Oh, the less said about her the better.<br> I mean, that incident.<br> Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.<br> [Sneezes]<br> Bless me.<br> Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.<br> The Bishop of Glastonbury<br> is attending my sermon this evening,<br> - and it's most important,<br> you understand.<br> - Of course.<br> - But my hay... hay... [Sneezes]<br> - [Lady Petherington Screams]<br> Oh! Oh! Oh!<br> But... But... Oh!<br> [Muttering]<br> [Screams]<br> Oh, my foot, my foot!<br> - Oh!<br> - Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!<br> Where in the heavens does<br> that woman think she's going?<br> - Get out of my way, Vicar!<br> - [Sneezes]<br> - Oh!<br> - [Animal Shrieks]<br> - [Sneezes]<br> - Ow!<br> - Oh!<br> - [Screams]<br> - Oh!<br> - [Barks]<br> - [Cat Screeches]<br> - [Barking]<br> Ow!<br> [Yelling, Screaming Continue]<br> Oh, let me out of this madhouse!<br> - Oh! Oh!<br> - Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!<br> [Sneezing]<br> - Ow!<br> - [Glass Breaks]<br> [Sobbing]<br> [Grunts]<br> John!<br> Yes, Sarah?<br> I shall give you just five minutes<br> to make up your mind.<br> Either you get rid of every<br> hideous bird, beast and reptile...<br> in this ridiculous<br> menagerie immediately,<br> - or I am leaving... today!<br> - But...<br> - Five minutes.<br> - Sarah, I can't just...<br> Oh, yes, you can just.<br> [Sighs]<br> I don't think five minutes<br> is very long.<br> [Sighs]<br> Anybody home?<br> Oh, come in, Matthew.<br> Well, l-I didn't know<br> you was having a party.<br> [Chuckles]<br> What are we celebrating?<br> You know, Matthew,<br> today I made a great discovery.<br> Oh? What was that then?<br> I'm a terrible doctor.<br> I'm probably<br> the worst doctor in the world.<br> Good for you.<br> I like a man who knows his worth.<br> I have absolutely no interest in<br> the health and welfare of my patients.<br> I can't begin<br> to communicate with them.<br> I don't even want<br> to communicate with them.<br> I've come to the conclusion that, with<br> the possible exception of yourself,<br> I have nothing in common<br> with the human race.<br> You know, the trouble with you,<br> John Dolittle,<br> is you prefer animals to people.<br> But animals are<br> so much more fun than people.<br> [Polynesia]<br> Then be an animal doctor. [Squawks]<br> - What was that?<br> - I said, "Be an animal doctor."<br> Animal doctor?<br> You know more about animals<br> than anybody I've ever met.<br> I could get every sick animal<br> within miles to come to you.<br> Aye, so could I.<br> At least all the dogs and cats.<br> All the rich ones, that is.<br> The Pekes and the poodles.<br> I could slip a little something<br> into their meat.<br> Shh, Matthew.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, there isn't one good<br> animal doctor in the west of England.<br> Farmer Green's cow was saying<br> only the other day...<br> she just will not have another calf<br> until she gets a decent doctor.<br> You mean, you spoke to her?<br> At the Animals' Welfare League.<br> We meet every Wednesday.<br> She's chair-cow.<br> You mean, animals actually<br> talk to one another?<br> Well, of course, we can.<br> Do you think we're all dumb?<br> L... No, no.<br> I knew parrots could talk.<br> Parrots are the finest linguists<br> in the animal kingdom.<br> I speak over 2,000 languages,<br> including dodo and unicorn.<br> - Unicorn?<br> - I have a classical education.<br> Polynesia, could I learn<br> to talk to animals?<br> I don't see why not.<br> You're quite intelligent.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> If I succeeded, I could become...<br> the greatest animal doctor<br> in the world.<br> Oh, no question.<br> Mind you, it isn't easy.<br> I'm the only parrot<br> in the world...<br> who actually understands<br> what she's talking about. [Squawks]<br> Well, if you can do it,<br> I don't see why I shouldn't.<br> I like your attitude.<br> Why have I never thought<br> of this before?<br> Polynesia, I want you<br> to teach me everything you know.<br> What, 2,000 languages?<br> Certainly. We'll start<br> at 8:00 tomorrow morning.<br> But it took me<br> over a hundred years.<br> Then we'll start at 7:00.<br> There's not a moment to lose.<br> Matthew, think<br> what it would mean...<br> [music] If I could talk<br> to the animals [music]<br> [Music]Just imagine it<br> Chatting to a chimp in chimpanzee [music]<br> [Music] Imagine talking to a tiger<br> Chatting to a cheetah [music]<br> [Music] What a neat achievement<br> that would be [music]<br> [Music] If we could talk<br> to the animals [music]<br> [Music] Learn their languages [music]<br> [Music] Maybe take an animal degree [music]<br> [Music] I'd study elephant and eagle<br> buffalo and beagle [music]<br> [Music] Alligator, guinea pig and flea [music]<br> [Music] I would converse<br> in polar bear and python [music]<br> [Music] And I would curse<br> in fluent kangaroo [music]<br> [Music] If people asked me<br> Can you speak rhinoceros [music]<br> [Music] I'd say, of course-eros<br> Can't you [music]<br> - [Chuckles]<br> - [Cat Meows]<br> [Meow]<br> - [Meow]<br> - [Music] If I conferred<br> with our furry friends [music]<br> [Music] Man-to-animal<br> Think of the amazing repartee [music]<br> [Music] If I could walk<br> with the animals [music]<br> [Music] Talk with the animals [music]<br> [Music] Grunt and squeak and squawk<br> with the animals [music]<br> [Music] And they could talk to me [music]<br> [Music] If I consulted with quadrupeds [music]<br> [Music] Think what fun we'd have [music]<br> [Music] Asking over crocodiles for tea [music]<br> [Music] Or maybe lunch<br> with two or three lions [music]<br> [Music] Walruses or sea lions [music]<br> [Music] What a lovely place<br> the world would be [music]<br> [Rooster Crows]<br> [Music] If I spoke slang to orangutans [music]<br> [Music] The advantages any fool on Earth<br> could plainly see [music]<br> [Music] Discussing Eastern art and dramas [music]<br> [Music] With intellectual llamas [music]<br> [Music] That's a big step forward<br> You'll agree [music]<br> [Music] I'd learn to speak<br> in antelope and turtle [music]<br> [Music] My Pekingese would be<br> extremely good [music]<br> [Music] If I were asked<br> to sing in hippopotamus [music]<br> [Music] I'd say, why not-amus<br> and would [music]<br> [Music] If I could parley<br> with pachyderms [music]<br> [Music] It's a fairy tale worthy<br> of Hans Andersen or Grimm [music]<br> [Music] A man who walks<br> with the animals [music]<br> [Music] Talks with the animals [music]<br> [Music] Grunts and squeaks and squawks<br> with the animals [music]<br> This is the most exciting thing<br> that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.<br> I can't wait to start.<br> [Pig Snorts]<br> Just the very thing.<br> For instance, Polynesia,<br> how would I say...<br> "good morning"<br> to our friend there?<br> In pig talk, I mean.<br> That's simple.<br> [Snorts]<br> - Was that it?<br> - Why, yes.<br> It's remarkable.<br> What was all the leg-shaking business?<br> That's part of "good morning."<br> Most animal languages are<br> a mixture of sounds and movements.<br> A short snort means "good."<br> Shaking the leg means "morning."<br> And you... And you<br> just put the two together?<br> That's right.<br> [Squawks]<br> [Snorts]<br> Didn't answer me.<br> No, that's your right leg.<br> That means "good night."<br> Oh.<br> [Snorts]<br> [Snorts]<br> She answered.<br> Did you see that? She answered.<br> All I went was...<br> [Snorts]<br> - [Snorts]<br> - Did it again.<br> Good heavens.

Good as new.<br> - There.<br> - [Squeaking]<br> [Squeaking]<br> No, no, no charge.<br> But, uh, keep away<br> from General Bellowes' pantry.<br> - Next.<br> - [Yips]<br> [Yips] Good morning, Sheila.<br> On the desk, please, Stubbins.<br> Yes, sir.<br> [Yipping]<br> [Yipping]<br> [Yipping]<br> - Oh, I see.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Apparently one of her children<br> have got flat feet.<br> This one? Yes.<br> Very dangerous in hunting season.<br> Can't run fast enough.<br> I'll work out some form of exercise.<br> [Yipping]<br> Bum-bum. Bum-bum.<br> Bum-bum. Something like that.<br> Anyhow, we'd better see<br> our other patients first.<br> I can get on with this later.<br> [Barking]<br> Good boy, Jip.<br> [Squawks]<br> Uh-oh.<br> Ah, Toggle.<br> [Neighs]<br> [Neighs]<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> Toggle's getting a bit<br> shortsighted in his old age.<br> There now.<br> We'll just, uh, test these.<br> Now, I'm sure this will be better<br> than the last time.<br> - [Neighs]<br> - [Neighs]<br> [Neighs]<br> [Neighs]<br> [Neighs]<br> [Neighs]<br> Good Lord.

What's the matter?<br> Out of my way!<br> Out of my way!<br> Get out of my way!<br> Get out of my way!<br> There he is.<br> We've caught him red-handed.<br> - Emma, you're a witness.<br> - A witness to what?<br> The most flagrant display<br> of organized animal stealing...<br> in the history<br> of Puddleby crime.<br> Organized? I beg...<br> I am a doctor, sir.<br> You are a horse thief, sir.<br> That is my plow horse.<br> It's no good<br> your trying to disguise him.<br> He's wearing glasses<br> because he's shortsighted.<br> I'd recognize him anywhere.<br> Take them off. At once, sir.<br> Shortsighted. That won't sound very<br> convincing in front of the magistrate.<br> - Magistrate?<br> - I'm prosecuting,<br> and I don't fancy<br> your chances in court.<br> I'm the magistrate,<br> and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,<br> - I'd report you for cruelty to animals.<br> - [Foxes Yipping]<br> Don't you dare lay a finger on her.<br> - She's one of my patients.<br> - One of your what?<br> She's been chased by your wretched<br> foxhounds three times in two weeks.<br> You've already murdered her husband.<br> If anything happened to her,<br> these babies are going to be orphans.<br> It's all right, Sheila.<br> I won't let him hurt you.<br> I've never heard... Sheila?<br> Just the sight of you is enough<br> to give her a heart attack.<br> Look at her.<br> She's a complete nervous wreck.<br> She'll be more than that<br> by the time I'm finished with her!<br> [Shrieking]<br> - You'll never catch her.<br> - Tallyho!<br> [Barking]<br> There are times when the English<br> are rather tiresome.<br> [Dogs Barking]<br> - Bellowes, no!<br> - [Barking]<br> [Bellowes]<br> Out of my way! [Shouting]<br> - Out of my way! Out of my way!<br> - Oh, well.<br> [Dogs Yelping]<br> "Never catch her," eh?<br> What do you think this is?<br> - [Whinnying]<br> - My horse!<br> [Barking]<br> - Where did they come from?<br> - North America.<br> We formed an Anglo-American<br> Fox Protection Society.<br> Purely volunteer, of course.<br> [Yipping]<br> Fox Protection Society?<br> Yes. During the hunting season,<br> a skunk will always run with a fox.<br> The idea is to put<br> the hounds off the scent.<br> I never dreamt<br> it would work so well.<br> - How dare you!<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - General Bellowes...<br> - He certainly does.<br> - Is my uncle.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Is that an apology?<br> - I'm sorry he's your uncle.<br> And I'm sorry I'm his niece.<br> - It must be terrible.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Having a name like Bellowes.<br> - My name is Emma Fairfax.<br> - Oh, that's a bit better.<br> What I meant was that if I were<br> his nephew instead of his niece...<br> If you were his nephew,<br> you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.<br> - If I were a man...<br> - Fred Fairfax?<br> I have never<br> in my entire experience...<br> known anyone treat people<br> as appallingly as you do.<br> I don't treat people, madam.<br> I treat animals.<br> You treat people like animals too.<br> And I have nothing but contempt<br> for people whose idea of pleasure...<br> is to take a defenseless animal and make<br> a social event out of a ritual killing.<br> - That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.<br> - Matthew, I am telling her.<br> - You make it sound...<br> - Furthermore...<br> - Don't keep interrupting me!<br> - I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?<br> Oh, I've forgotten!<br> Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it<br> a favor if in the future...<br> you and your<br> bloodthirsty relatives...<br> would avoid coming here<br> and upsetting the animals.<br> In any case, I find it hard<br> to believe that a grown man...<br> can waste his entire life<br> playing with animals in the first place.<br> And I, madam, find it<br> equally hard to believe...<br> that a grown woman could spend her<br> entire life doing absolutely nothing.<br> You got to admit that<br> for someone called Fred,<br> she's a fair-looking fellow.<br> [Music] If I were a man [music]<br> [Music] I'd scratch his eyes out [music]<br> [Music] I'd tear his hair out<br> by the roots [music]<br> [Music] And kick his shins in<br> with my boots [music]<br> [Music] And I would bite his hand<br> as only I can [music]<br> [Music] If only I could be a man [music]<br> [Music] A great man would not hesitate [music]<br> [Music] To put Dr. Dolittle to death [music]<br> [Music] Attila the Hun<br> To name only one [music]<br> [Music] Would chuckle at his dying breath [music]<br> [Music] It seems a man can be<br> as rude as he likes [music]<br> [Music] Crude as he likes<br> Lewd as he likes too [music]<br> [Music] But a girl must be<br> discreet as she can [music]<br> [Music] Sweet as she can<br> Neat as she can too [music]<br> [Music] But that's not the life [music]<br> [Music] That I want to lead [music]<br> [Music] Normal and formal<br> as homespun tweed [music]<br> [Music] I need the freedom to go [music]<br> [Music] Where I please [music]<br> [Music] But where [music]<br> [Music] Do I please [music]<br> [Music] I don't know [music]<br> [Music] That's the trouble [music]<br> [Music] I don't know [music]<br> [Music] Here I stand<br> at the crossroads of life [music]<br> [Music] Childhood behind me [music]<br> [Music] The future to come [music]<br> [Music] And alone [music]<br> [Music] Nothing planned<br> at the crossroads of life [music]<br> [Music] But life will find me [music]<br> [Music] More grateful than some [music]<br> [Music] It has known [music]<br> [Music] Grateful to see [music]<br> [Music] All the wonderful things I see [music]<br> [Music] Grateful to be [music]<br> [Music] What life expects me to be [music]<br> [Music] So I stand<br> at the crossroads of life [music]<br> [Music] This way or that way [music]<br> [Music] Well, which shall I go [music]<br> [Music] Towards the left<br> or the right [music]<br> [Music] Towards the day<br> or the night [music]<br> [Music] Towards the dark<br> or the light [music]<br> [Music] Only my heart can know [music]<br> [Music] Only my heart [music]<br> [Music] Can know [music]<br> [Trilling]<br> - What is it?<br> - Ha. I don't know, Doctor.<br> It just arrived for ya.<br> - It's making funny noises.<br> - [Trilling]<br> - Extraordinary-looking thing.<br> - It's from Tibet.<br> It's probably that pink sea snail<br> you was lookin' for.<br> No, it's not big enough for that.<br> What do you suppose it is?<br> Well, we could always<br> open it and find out.<br> Oh, yes. What a good idea.<br> Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.<br> - Come on, boy. Come on, boy.<br> - [Grunts]<br> I think he's nervous. Open up the<br> other end and give him a push, Matthew.<br> - Here.<br> - [Trilling]<br> There's another one at this end.<br> There's two of them.<br> Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.<br> People are awfully nice.<br> - What are you going to do with them?<br> - We could make ourselves...<br> a couple of nice overcoats<br> for a start.<br> [Trills]<br> Come on, boy. Come on, boy.<br> [Matthew]<br> This way, lad. Come on. Come on.<br> That's a good fella.<br> [Chuckles]<br> I don't believe it. It can't be.<br> - It is! It is!<br> - What? What? What?<br> It's a pushmi-pullyu.<br> - Look.<br> - Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.<br> I'll never touch another drop.<br> Stubbins, pat the other end.<br> They're very timid.<br> This is without doubt the first one<br> that's ever been captured.<br> If I had a head at each end,<br> I'd take a bit of catchin' too.<br> [Trilling]<br> - What's he saying, Doctor?<br> - It's rather difficult to understand.<br> It's a camel dialect<br> with rather a thick accent.<br> [Trilling]<br> - A message? Oh, a message for me.<br> - Is this it?<br> Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.<br> I should have guessed.<br> Who's he when he's at home?<br> The greatest naturalist in the world<br> and a very old friend.<br> - He's a Red Indian gentleman.<br> - With a name like Long Arrow,<br> I didn't think he was Irish.<br> - What's all them drawings, Doctor?<br> - Picture writing.<br> It's the only way<br> we can communicate.<br> You see, this means<br> the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.<br> The open hand, you see?<br> For me. That's me.<br> From his friend, Long Arrow.<br> To make money to take a ship...<br> to search for great pink sea snail.<br> Signed Long Arrow.<br> Oh, that's marvelous.<br> But tell me, Doctor, how do you<br> make money with a pushmi-pullyu?<br> I thought it was obvious. Stubbins,<br> what would you do if you had two heads?<br> - I'd join a circus, sir.<br> - Exactly.<br> Excuse me. I'm looking<br> for the proprietor.<br> You've found him. Albert Blossom.<br> - Splendid. How do you do?<br> My name's Dolittle.<br> - I'm not interested.<br> - I thought you might like<br> to see a rather unusual...<br> - No, I wouldn't.<br> It's probably something<br> you haven't seen before.<br> I've seen everything before.<br> - Then you aren't interested?<br> - That's right. I'm not interested.<br> Come along, Matthew.<br> - Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> - It's a trick.<br> - No, it's no trick.<br> Why... But... I've never<br> seen anything like it.<br> - Neither has anybody else.<br> - Hey, whoa! I say, come here!<br> Just a minute.<br> Hey, hey!

Catch it.<br> - [Moaning]<br> - Try again, Sophie.<br> Come on, Sophie.<br> - That's yours.<br> - Oh, thanks.<br> Right, well,<br> I'm off to the bank.<br> Ah, here we are now. "Seals are<br> notoriously sentimental creatures.<br> Prolonged separation from<br> those they love can result...<br> in complete lack of interest<br> in their usual activities."<br> That would explain why Sophie<br> keeps dropping things in her act.<br> It isn't like her.<br> I'm sure she's pining for some reason.<br> I must go and have a chat with her.<br> This fellow obviously knows<br> what he's talking about.<br> - Who wrote the book, Doctor?<br> - Uh, oh, I did.<br> - Hmm.<br> - [Woman]Just a moment!<br> I have something to say to you,<br> - Mr. Dolittle.<br> - Doctor.<br> Doctor?<br> I've heard of some hypocrites<br> in my time, but you are contemptible!<br> All that sanctimonious claptrap<br> about protecting defenseless creatures,<br> and here you are an animal trainer<br> in a cheap circus!<br> Exhibiting freaks!<br> Come, lad. Why don't you go<br> and make some cocoa?<br> - I don't want any cocoa, do you?<br> - I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.<br> Hello, Fred.<br> He is... He's very rude.<br> Who, the doctor?<br> Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.<br> Did you hear what<br> he said about my uncle?<br> Oh, that, yeah, well,<br> he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.<br> Of course, I wouldn't mind so much<br> except everything he said was true.<br> You should never believe anybody<br> who goes around tellin' the truth.<br> - They're not to be trusted.<br> - [Trilling]<br> - [Trills]<br> - Ya have to do it both ends.<br> Otherwise it gets jealous.<br> He was too ashamed to say<br> anything just now, of course.<br> - Too nice.<br> - Nice?<br> He's the kindest man<br> on God's Earth, Fred.<br> He understands animals better than you<br> and me will ever understand anythin'.<br> Well, I certainly<br> don't understand him.<br> Ah, sure, now.<br> He's one of the beautiful people.<br> And I'm sure now<br> he's one of the horrible people.<br> You're wrong, sweetheart.<br> [Music] I can't explain<br> what it is that he is [music]<br> [Music] But he is what he is<br> for a very good reason [music]<br> [Music] I can't explain why he does<br> what he does [music]<br> [Music] But he does what he does<br> 'cause his heart is pure [music]<br> [Music] Of that much [music]<br> [Chuckles]<br> [Music] I am sure [music]<br> [Music] I'm sure as I told<br> young Tom the other day [music]<br> [Music] He lives in<br> a world of fantasy [music]<br> [Music] And that is a world<br> I plan to see, fantasy [music]<br> [Music] Can't you see [music]<br> [Music] The world is full<br> of beautiful things [music]<br> [Music] Butterfly wings<br> Fairy tale kings [music]<br> [Music] And each new day<br> undoubtedly brings [music]<br> [Music] Still more beautiful things [music]<br> [Music] The world abounds<br> with many delights [music]<br> [Music] Magical sights<br> Fanciful flights [music]<br> [Music] And those who dream<br> on beautiful nights [music]<br> [Music] Dream of beautiful things [music]<br> [Music] Beautiful days<br> for sunshine lazin' [music]<br> [Music] Beautiful skies and shores [music]<br> [Music] Beautiful days<br> when I can gaze [music]<br> [Music] In beautiful eyes [music]<br> [Chuckles]<br> [Music] Like yours [music]<br> [Music] Our lives tick by<br> like a pendulum swings [music]<br> [Music] Poor little things<br> Puppets on strings [music]<br> [Music] But life is full [music]<br> [Music] Of beautiful things [music]<br> [Music] Beautiful people [music]<br> [Music] Too [music]<br> [Music] Beautiful people [music]<br> [Music] Like [music]<br> [Music] You [music]<br> - [Moaning]<br> - I see. I see.<br> [Moaning Continues]<br> I'm sorry. Hmm.<br> Ah, cocoa.<br> Come in, gentlemen.<br> You know Sophie, don't you?<br> Oh, yes, of course you do.<br> It seems we have<br> a problem on our hands.<br> Sophie's just been telling me<br> how much she misses her husband.<br> That's why she couldn't concentrate<br> on her performance, just as I thought.<br> - Where is her husband?<br> - The North Pole. That's the problem.<br> They were on their way there<br> when Sophie was captured.<br> If she doesn't get back to him,<br> she feels she's going to go<br> completely to pieces.<br> What do you want us to do?<br> Go to the North Pole?<br> Unfortunately, there isn't time,<br> but it's very pleasant up there.<br> But the North Pole<br> hasn't been discovered yet.<br> Not officially.<br> I'd never say anything about it.<br> I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.<br> Anyway, that's beside the point.<br> What we've got to do is<br> to get Sophie back to her husband.<br> Now, if I could get her<br> to the Bristol Channel,<br> she could swim it<br> in about a week.<br> You go along there,<br> around that bit, then straight on<br> and then slightly to the left.<br> Oh, that's great, but how does<br> she get to the Bristol Channel?<br> - Well, she'd have to escape.<br> - Escape? A seal?<br> I can hardly go to Blossom<br> and say she wanted to go to<br> the North Pole to see her husband.<br> He wouldn't believe a word.<br> - You know something?<br> - What?<br> - She's gonna have to escape.<br> - Tonight.<br> [Moaning]<br> [Horn Blowing]<br> [Horn Blowing]<br> - [Barks]<br> - Shh. Shh.<br> [Sophie Moans]<br> - Is everything all right, sir?<br> - It's my grandmother.<br> She's not very well.<br> I'm taking her to Bristol.<br> - Can you smell fish?<br> - Fish?<br> It's Granny.<br> She's on a special diet.<br> Very wise, sir.<br> [Moans, Burps]<br> [Burps]<br> Are you all right, dear?<br> Enjoying the trip?<br> - [Exhales]<br> - Oh, that's good.<br> Whoa! Whoa!<br> [Man] What's the delay?<br> What's going on there?<br> Jack Fitch, the highwayman,<br> has been seen on this road.<br> We have to search all coaches.<br> Help yourself.<br> You'll find no surprise in here.<br> [Horse Nickers]<br> All right, driver.<br> [Driver]<br> All right, get up.<br> All right, go on.<br> [Nickers]<br> - [Nickers]<br> - [Nickers]<br> Come back here, Nelly!<br> Nelly, come back here!<br> Where are you going?<br> Where are you going, Nelly?<br> Come on back!<br> Come back here, I tell ya!<br> [Whinnies]<br> [Sophie Grunting]<br> Well, here we are. Sorry it was<br> such an uncomfortable journey,<br> but it was really the only way.<br> There, there, there, Sophie.<br> Don't get upset.<br> I can't bear females who cry.<br> - [Cries]<br> - Shh. Don't look at me<br> like that, Sophie,<br> or I'll get upset too.<br> Dear Sophie, you understand<br> so much, don't you?<br> [Music] When I look in your eyes [music]<br> [Music] I see the wisdom of the world<br> in your eyes [music]<br> [Music] I see the sadness<br> of a thousand good-byes [music]<br> - [Moans]<br> - [Music] When I look in your eyes [music]<br> Shh, shh.<br> [Music] And it is no surprise [music]<br> [Music] To see the softness<br> of the moon in your eyes [music]<br> [Music] The gentle sparkle of<br> the stars in the skies [music]<br> - [Music] When I look in your eyes [music]<br> - [Barks]<br> [Moaning]<br> [Music] In your eyes I see<br> the deepness of the sea [music]<br> - [Grunting]<br> - [Music]I see the deepness [music]<br> [Music] Of the love, the love<br> I feel you feel for me [music]<br> [Grunts]<br> [Music] Autumn comes, summer dies [music]<br> [Music] I see the passing<br> of the years in your eyes [music]<br> [Music] And when we part, there will<br> be no tears, no good-byes [music]<br> - [Moans]<br> - [Music] I'll just look into your eyes [music]<br> [Moaning]<br> [Music] Dear Sophie<br> Those eyes so wise [music]<br> [Music] So warm, so real [music]<br> [Music] Isn't it a pity<br> you're a seal [music]<br> [Moans]<br> [Sophie Barking]<br> [Barking]<br> Well, she's on her way.<br> - What did you throw her in for?<br> - She wanted to go back to her husband.<br> No, you don't understand at all.<br> She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.<br> - A seal?<br> - Yes.<br> Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?<br> That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed<br> it from this lady in the tavern.<br> The bonnet had<br> a little brown ribbon through...<br> Never mind about<br> the brown ribbons.<br> You then took the seal<br> to Bristol in a stagecoach...<br> and upon arrival promptly<br> threw her over a cliff.<br> Exactly.<br> May one ask why?<br> Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go<br> to the North Pole to see her husband.<br> [Crowd Laughing]<br> - Her husband?<br> - Yes.<br> What makes you think this seal<br> wanted to go to the North Pole?<br> - Well, she told me.<br> - She told you?<br> Yes, we discussed it<br> in great detail.<br> - [Scattered Laughing]<br> - Are you in the habit<br> of talking to animals?<br> Yes, I am.<br> I do it all the time.<br> - [Laughing]<br> - I thought perhaps you did.<br> [Laughing Continues]<br> With all due respect to<br> Your Worship, I think I detect<br> a note of skepticism in the court.<br> I would, therefore,<br> like an opportunity...<br> to prove the point by talking<br> to any animal you care to nominate.<br> [Crowd Murmuring]<br> Very well then.<br> My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!<br> - [Door Opens]<br> - [Rufus Barks]<br> [Barks]<br> - [Barks]<br> - [Barks]<br> Oh, that's very kind of you.<br> This way, please.<br> [Barks]<br> - [Barking]<br> - [Barks]<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> Yes, Rufus will be only too happy<br> to answer any questions you care to ask.<br> [Crowd Murmuring]<br> Oh, I think we can dispense<br> with that formality.<br> Uh, ask him what I had<br> for dinner last night.<br> Very well.<br> [Barking]<br> Did he?<br> Well, really? Did he?<br> - [Barking Continues]<br> - [Chuckling] Good Lord. Well, well.<br> - [Barking Continues]<br> - Did he really?<br> Well, well, well.<br> [Laughing]<br> - [Rufus Barks]<br> - What did he say?<br> I'm grateful that Your Worship<br> acknowledges the fact<br> that the dog was talking.<br> [Scattered Laughing]<br> For dinner last night,<br> Your Lordship enjoyed the following:<br> Two helpings of boiled trout,<br> four helpings of roast pheasant,<br> - roast potatoes,<br> brussels sprouts and gravy,<br> - [Crowd Exclaims]<br> Followed by six large portions<br> of blackberry pie with whipped cream.<br> - [Crowd Exclaims]<br> - It's not true! I only had<br> five helpings of blackberry pie!<br> Your Lordship also drank<br> a great deal of wine and brandy...<br> and later in the evening sang<br> noisy songs with your friends<br> about a woman from Swansea...<br> - That's enough!<br> - [Crowd Murmurs]<br> The court is adjourned<br> until tomorrow morning,<br> pending inquiries about<br> the bonnet and shawl stolen<br> from the tavern in question.<br> [Barks]<br> Hmm. Thank you.<br> [Barks]<br> Well, by my calculation, the trial<br> will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.<br> Polynesia, how much did<br> we earn from the circus?<br> [Squawks] 206 pounds,<br> seven and fourpence, halfpenny.<br> Ah, it's more than enough.<br> I see no reason why we shouldn't set out<br> to find the pink sea snail right away.<br> Matthew, go to the house<br> and pick up my clothes.<br> Have the boat<br> ready to sail by 12:00.<br> We'll catch the noontide<br> or whatever it's called.<br> We haven't got a crew,<br> so we'll have to make due with you<br> and Stubbins and the animals.<br> I can come too?<br> If your parents say so<br> and you know how to tie a knot.<br> Hear that? We're going to help<br> the doctor find the pink sea snail.<br> I should wait until you see<br> his boat before you get too excited.<br> It isn't by chance<br> it's called the Flounder.<br> No sailor in his right mind<br> would touch it.<br> I'm not asking a sailor<br> in his right mind. I was asking you.<br> What do you say?<br> I say that for a man who's<br> about to be hanged for murder...<br> to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure<br> cruise shows a very nice outlook.<br> [Door Opens]<br> - Fred!<br> - To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?<br> - I've brought dinner.<br> - Dinner?<br> - Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.<br> - Oh.<br> Set it down there, Hubert.<br> Steak and kidney pie<br> and oxtail and roast beef.<br> - Would you like some?<br> - Uh, no.<br> Oh, come on, Doctor.<br> Ya haven't had a bite all day.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - He's a vegetarian.<br> Oh, no!<br> It, uh, seems<br> a pity to waste it.<br> It's all right, Matthew.<br> Um, carry on.<br> I'm sorry, Doctor.<br> Come on, Tom.<br> Doctor?<br> Um, Rufus was right.<br> He did have six helpings<br> of blackberry pie.<br> - Thank you.<br> - [Chittering]<br> Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.<br> - [Both Laughing]<br> - [Chee-Chee Chittering]<br> It seems that a bonnet and shawl<br> were, in fact, removed...<br> from the tavern in question<br> on the day in question.<br> The lady who owns them,<br> for reasons best known to herself,<br> has no wish to prosecute.<br> You are, therefore, acquitted<br> of the charge of murder.<br> - [Crowd Murmuring]<br> - [Bell Tolling]<br> [Tolling Continues]<br> Thank you very much.<br> However,<br> your performance in this courtroom<br> in the past two days...<br> has left little doubt in the minds of my<br> distinguished colleagues and myself...<br> that your lunatic activities<br> with animals infringe<br> upon the public safety...<br> and are not to be tolerated.<br> Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing<br> benevolence provides a sanctuary<br> for sad people like you...<br> who think they can talk to animals and<br> want to treat them like human beings.<br> Therefore, it is<br> the judgment of this court...<br> that you be committed indefinitely<br> to an asylum for the insane.<br> Have you anything to say?<br> [Music] I do not understand<br> the human race [music]<br> [Music] It has so little love<br> for creatures [music]<br> [Music] With a different face [music]<br> [Music] Treating animals like people<br> is no madness or disgrace [music]<br> [Music] I do not understand<br> the human race [music]<br> [Music] I wonder why do we treat<br> animals like animals [music]<br> [Music] Animals treat us so very well [music]<br> [Music] The devoted way they serve us<br> and protect us when we're nervous [music]<br> [Music] Oh, they really don't deserve us [music]<br> [Music] All we give them is hell [music]<br> [Music] Tell me how else<br> man repays them [music]<br> [Music] Do we ever think to<br> praise them, no, we don't [music]<br> [Music] And this dismays them<br> You can tell [music]<br> [Music] We are riddled with ingratitude<br> We give no love or latitude [music]<br> [Music] In every way our attitude is<br> well, like animals [music]<br> No, no.

That's why Matthew's got<br> this marvelous plan to get him out.<br> Then this second elephant...<br> he's bigger than the first elephant...<br> All the doctor has to do is step through<br> the hole in the wall onto his back.<br> - You'll never get away with this.<br> - Listen, here's the clever part.<br> He slides down the elephant's trunk onto<br> a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!<br> Just the three of you<br> are going off on this boat?<br> Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia<br> and Jip are coming too.<br> Then there's these six tigers,<br> you see, to stop anyone followin'.<br> To look for a pink sea snail?<br> They'll be standing on<br> the other side of the road<br> while I'm settin' off the dynamite.<br> - Dynamite? [Squawks]<br> - Oh, sure.<br> If we blow up the road,<br> they'll have to go all the way<br> around the town to get to the harbor,<br> which gives me time<br> to nip back here...<br> and blow up the bridge while<br> you're gettin' on the boat.<br> That's the beauty of this whole plan...<br> its simplicity.<br> - Are they really going to<br> keep the doctor in prison?<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> They're moving him across<br> to the loony bin at 12:00.<br> - [Squawks] Today?<br> - Aye.<br> I've also an idea.<br> You get the boat ready.<br> Leave the doctor to me.<br> We sail at 12:00. Avast now.<br> - [Squawks]<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> We're a fine bunch,<br> takin' orders from a parrot.<br> Matthew, how did you enjoy<br> the food I brought you<br> in the prison the other night?<br> 'Twas the best meal<br> I ever had in me life.<br> They say that prison food is terrible.<br> I won't hear a word against it.<br> I was thinking.<br> Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have<br> those kind of meals on your voyage?<br> Oh, true now.<br> It would be marvelous.<br> The only way we could do that<br> is if you was to...<br> If we was to, uh...<br> Ah!<br> [Laughs]<br> I'll tell you one thing, Fred.<br> I only hope there's<br> no stowaways on that boat.<br> Because if there was,<br> I wouldn't know where to look for them.<br> Anyway, once we're out at sea<br> with an escaped convict,<br> there's no turnin' back.<br> Oh, Matthew!<br> I love you!<br> [Music] Who would have thought<br> that one little kiss [music]<br> [Music] Soft and sweet from<br> the lips of a lovely girl [music]<br> [Music] Would to change my life [music]<br> [Music] But by my life [music]<br> [Music] It will [music]<br> [Music] After today nothing<br> will be the same again [music]<br> [Music] After today I'll make<br> my claim to fame and then [music]<br> [Music] The grass will be greener [music]<br> [Music] And the air will be cleaner [music]<br> [Music] And my life be serener [music]<br> [Music] Than heaven knows when [music]<br> [Music] Heaven knows when [music]<br> [Music] After today I shall have<br> bid my fears good-bye [music]<br> [Music] After today I shall<br> have no more tears [music]<br> [Music] To cry [music]<br> [Music] I'll learn to live<br> with laughter to stay [music]<br> [Music] After [music]<br> [Music] Today [music]<br> [Music] After today nothing<br> will be the way it was [music]<br> [Music] After today I'll say<br> Oh, what a day it was [music]<br> [Music] My heart will be lighter [music]<br> [Music] And my smile<br> will be brighter [music]<br> [Music] And I'll be<br> twice the fighter [music]<br> [Music] That ever I was [music]<br> [Music] Clever because [music]<br> [Music] After today I shall have<br> bid my fears farewell [music]<br> [Music] After today I shall<br> have no more tears [music]<br> [Music] To quell [music]<br> [Music] I'll learn to live<br> with laughter [music]<br> [Music] To stay [music]<br> [Music] After the tears<br> comes the laughter [music]<br> [Music] After today [music]<br> - [Horse Whinnies]<br> - [Bell Tolling]<br> [Tolling Continues]<br> [Squawks]<br> [Squawking]<br> [Horse Nickers]<br> [Horse Whinnies]<br> [Polynesia Squawks]<br> Chee-Chee.<br> [Squawking]<br> - [Whinnies]<br> - [Whinnying]<br> [Whinnies]<br> Run!

No, this way!<br> - Ta-ta.<br> - Stop them!<br> - Stop them! Stop them!<br> It's all right, Doctor.<br> You can come out now.<br> - There's not a policeman in sight.<br> - Oh, thank you, Matthew.<br> Makes a very good little reading room,<br> this. I must use it more often.<br> Now, let's see where we are.<br> [Barking]<br> - [Barking]<br> - Ah, I see.<br> He says there's a faint smell of garlic<br> coming from the southeast.<br> - What does that mean?<br> - It means we're about ten miles<br> off the coast of France.<br> I've got about the best navigational<br> system on the high seas today.<br> Jip's got this<br> incredible sense of smell,<br> and Polynesia gets<br> marvelous weather reports<br> from the passing birds and fishes.<br> - Everything all right at the house?<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> Good. Keep an eye on everything and<br> don't bump into anything like Ireland.<br> Aye, aye, Doctor.<br> - A very well organized escape.<br> Thank you.<br> - Don't mention it.<br> I doubt if there's a ship afloat<br> with flowers like these.<br> Look at these geraniums.<br> Absolutely glorious.<br> Have you seen my azaleas<br> on the starboard side?<br> - No, sir, I can't say as I have.<br> - They're doing wonderfully.<br> How are you enjoying life<br> on the rolling deep?<br> If the good Lord meant us to take<br> to water, He'd have given us flippers.<br> - [Chuckles]<br> - [Hooting]<br> No, Stubbins,<br> move your mouth about more.<br> You must reread my essay<br> on basic chimpanzee, page one.<br> I must cut these roses back.<br> There's so much to do on a ship.<br> - [Boiling]<br> - What a marvelous smell, Matthew.<br> What have you been cooking?<br> I'm absolutely starving.<br> [Emma]<br> Will this do?<br> Do come on while it's still hot.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I thought someone capable ought<br> to look after Tommy on the voyage.<br> Stubbins is perfectly capable<br> of looking after himself.<br> I must turn the ship around<br> and go straight back to Puddleby...<br> uh, well, immediately after lunch.<br> They'll, uh... They'll put ya<br> inside if you go back, Doctor.<br> Oh, yes, that is a point.<br> What are we going to do<br> with her if she stays?<br> You make me<br> sound like a stray cat.<br> A cat would be most welcome.<br> Don't worry. It's vegetarian.<br> - It's delicious.<br> - It's marvelous.<br> [Chuckles]<br> Mmm. What is it?<br> - Algue marine en croute.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - What's that in English?<br> - Seaweed pie.<br> Mmm! It's really rather good.<br> - Well, where are we going?<br> - To hunt for the great pink sea snail.<br> And where do you<br> expect to find it?<br> I haven't the faintest idea.<br> But as one place is as good as another,<br> it's high time we decided.<br> - Otherwise, when we get there,<br> we won't know we've arrived.<br> - Good thinking.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Are your voyages always<br> as well planned as this?<br> When possible. Unfortunately,<br> one doesn't always have time<br> to go into minute details.<br> - Such as knowing where you're going?<br> - That sort of thing.<br> But then how do you decide?<br> We play a little game I invented.<br> One of us opens the atlas at random,<br> sticks a pin in the open page.<br> Wherever it lands,<br> that's where we go.<br> - You can't be serious.<br> - I'm very serious.<br> That is the most ridiculous thing<br> I have ever heard of.<br> You could end up in<br> all sorts of terrible places.<br> That's absolutely true.<br> I remember going to the Sahara Desert<br> four times in succession...<br> before I realized Chee-Chee<br> had stuck down all the other pages<br> of the atlas with jam.<br> Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.<br> But that is exactly what I mean.<br> It's all right now. I cleaned<br> all the jam off. Little bit there.<br> How you can sit there and say what<br> you're saying I just don't know.<br> I must admit the Sahara is one place<br> I'm praying we just won't go.<br> You know, that's absolutely<br> typical of a woman.<br> [Music] There are so many fabulous<br> faraway places to see [music]<br> She makes one seaweed pie<br> and goes mad.<br> [Music] Such as Mexico, Sweden<br> Hawaii, Japan and Capri [music]<br> Who does she think she is?<br> [Music] There's so many exciting<br> and wonderful places [music]<br> [Music] Much more inviting<br> than desert oases [music]<br> [Music] Pleasant as home is<br> it isn't what Rome is [music]<br> [Music] So why stay there [music]<br> [Music] When there are so many fabulous<br> faraway places to see [music]<br> As though the seaweed pie<br> was all that marvelous.<br> [Music] Why should Spain<br> and Tahiti and Rio [music]<br> - [Music]Just be only names to you and me [music]<br> - Is there any more?<br> [Music] I feel certain there are people<br> we'd be glad to know there [music]<br> [Music] So tell me why don't<br> we get up and go there [music]<br> [Music] Go to those fabulous places<br> where we long to be [music]<br> [Music] Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong<br> and Paris and Venice [music]<br> [Music] Tokyo and Cairo<br> and Lisbon and London [music]<br> [Music] Wonderful, fabulous places [music]<br> [Music] We're longing to see [music]<br> [Music] When I think of<br> the warm Caribbean [music]<br> [Music] I see a new world<br> for you and me [music]<br> [Music] I'd give anything just to<br> have one single day there [music]<br> [Music] Once we get there<br> I know that we'll stay there [music]<br> [Music] Stay in those fabulous places<br> where we long to be [music]<br> - [Music] Such as Siam [music]<br> - [Music] Sienna [music]<br> - [Music] Vienna [music]<br> - [Music] Verona [music]<br> - [Music]Java, Jamaica [music]<br> - [Music]Jamaica, Bombay [music]<br> - [Music] Barcelona [music]<br> - Ole!<br> - Ole! Ole! Ole!<br> - El toro!<br> - Ha, ha!<br> - Ole! Ole! Ole!<br> [Music] Show me those fabulous places [music]<br> [Music] I'm longing to see [music]<br> My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem<br> to have entirely missed the point.<br> [Music] I'm aware there are fabulous places<br> wherever we sail [music]<br> - Will we see them?<br> - We will.<br> [Music] But the point of the journey<br> is science and finding the snail [music]<br> [Music] An incomparable thrill [music]<br> [Music] We shall question the sharks<br> off the coast of Tobago [music]<br> [Music] Interview swamp life<br> in Tierra del Fuego [music]<br> - [Music] That sounds horrendous [music]<br> - [Music] No, no, it's tremendous<br> and well worthwhile [music]<br> [Music] We'll make detailed inquiries<br> of every crustacean we meet [music]<br> - Crustacean?<br> - [Music] Shellfish, they're sweet [music]<br> [Music] We will sail<br> to the ends of the earth [music]<br> [Music] Till our search for the snail<br> is quite complete [music]<br> [Music] We'll interrogate beetles<br> and bugs in Nigeria [music]<br> [Music] And if we have to<br> spend weeks in Siberia [music]<br> [Music] Eighty below but a place<br> that we all ought to see [music]<br> [Music] But I haven't brought<br> the right clothes for Siberia [music]<br> [Music] Those are the fabulous places<br> you'll visit with me [music]<br> Sounds as if we're in<br> for a good time.<br> [Music] Well, Siberia is one place<br> you'll never see me go [music]<br> [Music] Stick in the pin<br> Where the pins goes, then we go [music]<br> - Ireland!<br> - Romania!<br> - No, Ruritania!<br> [Music] We'll chase that sea snail<br> from here to Tasmania [music]<br> [Music] Show me those fabulous places [music]<br> [Music]I'm longing to [music]<br> [Music]I'm longing to [music]<br> [Music] See [music]<br> It doesn't count.<br> You landed in the sea.<br> No, she hasn't. Look. There.<br> Well, that doesn't<br> look very interesting.<br> - What is it?<br> - "Sea Star Island.<br> Last reported position."<br> Last reported position?<br> What can that mean?<br> The Sea Star Island. That's faintly<br> familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.<br> "Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.<br> Sea Star Island."<br> [Mutters]<br> It's that floating island.<br> It moves all over the world like a ship.<br> It's a freak of nature.<br> This time of year it's sometimes<br> sighted off the coast of Africa.<br> How terribly exciting.<br> I think you have chosen rather well.<br> I don't think<br> it's exciting at all.<br> Couldn't we go to...<br> Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?<br> Miss Fairfax, this is a serious<br> zoogeographical expedition.<br> It's not a pleasure cruise<br> for your personal benefit.<br> I promise to ask for<br> no special privileges.<br> I promise to grant none.<br> A ship is no place for a woman.<br> The simple answer then<br> is to treat me like a man.<br> I intend to.<br> Well, good-bye.<br> [Mutters]<br> Twelve.<br> Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?<br> And the arithmetic?<br> You're winning, sir, I think.<br> Ah, well, that's the first sure sign<br> we've been at sea too long.<br> Polynesia spoke to some swallows.<br> They said there's a terrific storm<br> up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?<br> No, it isn't.<br> Can't we drive round it?<br> I shouldn't think so.<br> The latest long-range fish forecast<br> wasn't too encouraging.<br> Jip said he could smell thunder.<br> - I didn't know thunder had a smell.<br> - It does if you're a dog.<br> Uh, 82. Mind you,<br> Jip does tend to exaggerate.<br> If you ask me, bein' at sea is<br> very much the same as bein' in prison,<br> except at sea ya stand<br> a better chance of drownin'.<br> That reminds me. One of the ship's rats<br> came to see me this afternoon.<br> Said he had<br> a distinct tingle in his tail,<br> a sure sign the ship was going down.<br> So his lot are preparing to leave,<br> according to rat tradition.<br> He highly recommended<br> we should do the same.<br> There's nowhere we can go.<br> - Exactly. That's what I told the rat.<br> - Two.<br> - [Wind Howling]<br> - [Thunderclap]<br> - What was that?<br> - A bit of lightning. That's all.<br> When you finish clearing up, you better<br> batten down the hatches and stay below.<br> Women are always<br> scared stiff of storms.<br> Well, I'm not.<br> I'm a man, remember?<br> [Thunderclap]<br> I dread to think what this<br> is going to do to my azaleas.<br> August 10.<br> Signs of inclement weather.<br> Crew's morale remains high.<br> [Thunderclap]<br> [Chittering]<br> [Squawks]<br> Steady as she goes.<br> [Squawking]<br> [Whimpering]<br> [Animal Vocalizing]<br> [Clicking]<br> [Clicks]<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much, indeed.<br> - Any sign of her, Polynesia?<br> - Not yet.<br> Ah, good morning, Stubbins.<br> Beautiful day.<br> Yes, sir, good morning.<br> What happened to the ship?<br> Very good question.<br> If we ever find enough bits,<br> we'll put them together and find out.<br> [Chee-Chee Chittering]<br> Come on, Matthew.<br> Rise and shine.<br> [Groans] I told ya Flounder<br> was a terrible name for a boat.<br> Nonsense. The flounder's<br> a most reliable little fish.<br> It's survived the sea<br> for thousands of years.<br> Aye, below the surface.<br> Anyway, we're all safe.<br> That's the main thing.<br> - At least, we will be as soon<br> as we find Miss Fairfax.<br> - Poor Fred.<br> I said all along a ship<br> was no place for a woman.<br> Heaven knows I did my best to make<br> the voyage pleasant for her.<br> You can't spend your life<br> running after a woman,<br> waiting on her hand and foot<br> when there's important work to be done.<br> I think under the circumstances<br> I treated her very well.<br> Probably too well.<br> Spoiled her, in fact.<br> And I tied her<br> very securely to that raft.<br> I hope she's all right.<br> That's all.<br> - We'll make a full-scale search<br> as soon as we get ashore.<br> - Ashore?<br> Sea Star Island.<br> That's where we're going, isn't it?<br> Apart from the fact<br> that we're shipwrecked,<br> that we have no means of gettin' there,<br> and that we don't know<br> where it is anyway, yes.<br> You mustn't worry about things<br> like that, Matthew.<br> By my calculations, we were sort of<br> coming down in this direction like this,<br> and the floating island was sort of<br> coming down in that direction like that.<br> Then we sort of somehow or other<br> sort of more or less meet...<br> somewhere round about here.<br> Is that a fact?<br> Ah! There it is now.<br> Well, shall we go ashore?<br> [Toots]<br> [Dolittle]<br> Giddyap.<br> I must remember to get meself<br> one of those.<br> Hmph. Any sign of Fred?<br> Not yet. I only hope<br> she caught the island.<br> It won't be passing here<br> again for months.<br> You and Stubbins search the beaches.<br> I'll go inland.<br> - Meet back here in two or three hours.<br> - Yeah. Tommy?<br> Polynesia, I want every living creature<br> on this island looking for that girl.<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> - Every bird that can fly I want<br> airborne until she's found.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> She can't be at sea.<br> We'd have heard from the fish by now.<br> - You sure she'll be<br> all right, Polynesia?<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> She's standing<br> right behind you.<br> Good morning.<br> Oh, good morning.<br> Um, afraid we had<br> a bit of a storm last night.<br> Thank you for telling me.<br> Pity you got lost. You could have<br> given us a hand getting these ashore.<br> I'm sorry. I was fully occupied<br> getting myself ashore.<br> No mind. We managed. Some of these books<br> are very heavy though.<br> Saved all your books, I see.<br> - Yes, most fortunate.<br> - You lost all my dresses.<br> Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk<br> floating amongst the wreckage.<br> However, the outfit you're<br> wearing this morning...<br> is the nicest thing I've seen you in<br> since you left England.<br> This is my underwear.<br> Oh. Anyway, it suits you.<br> I'm terribly glad to see you.<br> Are you?<br> Uh, well, we got<br> a tremendous lot to do.<br> We've got to unload the raft,<br> find food and build whatever<br> it is one has to build.<br> - What are you trying to say?<br> - Hmm?<br> Why don't you say what you mean?<br> What do you mean, say what I mean?<br> [Music] For a month or more<br> I have listened and dreamed [music]<br> [Music] While the moon has glistened<br> and a million stars have gleamed [music]<br> - [Music] Waiting [music]<br> - Waiting?<br> - [Music] Waiting [music]<br> - What for?<br> What for? [music] For a man<br> I know who is clever and kind [music]<br> [Music] But a man who never ever<br> seems to know his mind [music]<br> [Music] Waiting [music]<br> [Music] Waiting [music]<br> [Music] Waiting for you to say<br> you like me [music]<br> [Music] Or hate me or miss me<br> or kiss me or something [music]<br> [Music] But nothing<br> Nothing do you say [music]<br> [Music] At all [music]<br> [Music] Little wonder I feel<br> sorely neglected [music]<br> [Music] Unwanted, rejected and small [music]<br> [Music] Little more than two feet tall [music]<br> [Music] Lucky to be here [music]<br> [Music] At all [music]<br> Emma?<br> I think I... like you.<br> Yes, I think I do.<br> I think I like you.<br> [Music] I'm almost sure that I do [music]<br> [Music] I think I like<br> the way you look [music]<br> [Music] The way your eyes<br> reveal your mind [music]<br> [Music] Like a precious book<br> that's hard to find [music]<br> [Music] I think I'm learning<br> something strange and new [music]<br> [Music] But it's well worth learning [music]<br> [Music] Because I'm learning about you [music]<br> [Music] Like dawning sunshine [music]<br> [Music] When a new day is due [music]<br> [Music] I think I like you [music]<br> [Music] And I think you like me too [music]<br> Do you?<br> Do you?<br> Do you?<br> Good afternoon. Good afternoon.<br> [Bird Calling]<br> Good heavens. I do believe that's<br> a great crested oriental moonbird.<br> [Calling]<br> It's terribly rare.<br> I'm so glad we came.<br> Great crested oriental moonbird.<br> What a bit of luck.<br> Ah, that's better.<br> - [Jip Whimpering]<br> - Thank you very much. [Squeaking]<br> Bye-bye.<br> The locals aren't<br> a very friendly lot, are they?<br> I bet you anything you like<br> they're going to kill us.<br> Whoever said children had beautiful<br> minds had obviously never met you.<br> Bein' in prison is much<br> the same as bein' on a boat,<br> except in prison<br> there's less chance of drownin'.<br> And less chance of our<br> getting back to Puddleby.<br> I must have a serious talk<br> to whoever runs this place.<br> I promised to get Stubbins home<br> in time to go to school.<br> I'm sure if you tell them that<br> we'll be out of here in no time.<br> Give me a leg up.<br> I want to see what's going on out there.<br> [Grunts]<br> [People Chattering]<br> Good heavens.<br> [Grunts]<br> All right, Matthew. Down.<br> - Why is it so cold?<br> - It's like being back in England.<br> There's a bit of frost. That's all.<br> It's quite clear what happened.<br> The storm that sank<br> the Flounder must have blown<br> the island off its usual course.<br> We're drifting too far north.<br> If we don't do something about it,<br> that marvelous vegetation<br> is going to die of frostbite.<br> To say nothin'<br> of our dear selves.<br> This is obviously<br> the gentleman to talk to.<br> Good morning.<br> Me Dr. Dolittle.<br> Search for great pink sea snail.<br> Small boy late for school.<br> Here very cold.<br> They all go home<br> Puddleby, yes?<br> What a funny accent.<br> Oh, I beg your pardon.<br> Actually, that's what<br> I came to see you about.<br> My name is William Shakespeare,<br> the Tenth. You may call me Willie.<br> Come with me, please.<br> Thank you.<br> We've had lots of<br> shipwrecks, of course.<br> Being a floating island does tend to<br> make us a bit of a danger to shipping.<br> We've bumped into lots<br> of things over the years.<br> But on the credit side, it enabled us<br> to build a marvelous museum...<br> and public library... books and<br> art treasures from all over the place.<br> Everybody on the island<br> speaks nine or ten languages.<br> We even name our children<br> after our favorite authors.<br> That's why my name<br> is William Shakespeare.<br> Do forgive this paraphernalia.<br> We're rehearsing now<br> The Merchant Of Venice<br> for our Shakespeare drama festival.<br> - Do sit down. Milk or lemon?<br> - Milk, please.<br> Must be a near perfect civilization.<br> Then what are we doin' in prison?<br> Purely a precaution, old boy,<br> a sort of quarantine.<br> Most of the white men who have<br> come here in the past...<br> usually started killing people<br> before they've been introduced.<br> - Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.<br> - Thank you.<br> But they never stay long.<br> They can't stand the peace and quiet.<br> I love peace and quiet,<br> but unfortunately we won't<br> be able to stay long either.<br> We've got to continue our hunt<br> for the great pink sea snail.<br> You haven't by any chance heard<br> of it being in the vicinity?<br> At the moment you have a bigger problem<br> than looking for snails.<br> According to<br> popular superstition,<br> newcomers to the island<br> are responsible for all our misfortunes.<br> So the elders of the village<br> are blaming you for this frost.<br> I don't know what we can do<br> about that. Perhaps there<br> is something I can think of.<br> I do hope so for your sake.<br> You see, it's written here<br> in the law book.<br> "He who brings sunshine<br> to the coldness of our days...<br> shall bask in the splendor<br> of a thousand summers."<br> - That's very nice.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yes, but it goes on.<br> "He who brings winter<br> into the summer of our lives...<br> shall die the death<br> of a thousand screams."<br> - Oh.<br> - I prefer the first one.<br> Yes, so did I.<br> The elders are also blaming you<br> for what's happened to the animals.<br> What has happened<br> to the animals?<br> They've all caught colds.<br> They're coughing and sneezing<br> all over the place.<br> I must do something about this<br> immediately. Come along, Polynesia.<br> We've got work to do.<br> - [Squawking]<br> - [Sneezes]<br> - Bless you.<br> - [Sneezes]<br> Gesundheit.<br> [Squawks]<br> Ha.<br> - [Animal Sneezes]<br> - [Polynesia] Bless you.<br> Here you are, Tommy. Another little<br> baby lion for you to take care of.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - [Sneezes]<br> [Polynesia]<br> Bless you.<br> That inhalant seems<br> to be working very well.<br> - [Elephant Moans, Sneezes]<br> - [Polynesia] Bless you.<br> I was hoping this<br> mustard bath would work.<br> - Still very hot.<br> - [Trumpets]<br> How soon will<br> my cough mixture be ready?<br> - Five minutes. Smell.<br> - Mmm!<br> I'd give it to the baby elephant<br> first, if I were you.<br> - Why?<br> - She's got a terrible cold.<br> I want to control it<br> before she gives it to the family.<br> When a herd of elephants start sneezing,<br> it's like a hurricane.<br> Might drive the island even further<br> off course. Thank you very much.<br> - [Elephant Moans, Sneezes]<br> - [Polynesia] Gesundheit.<br> If we was to point them<br> in the right direction, perhaps<br> they could blow us back on course.<br> Pretty good theory,<br> but terribly difficult to organize.<br> If elephants could swim,<br> one good shove...<br> and we'd be back in a southerly current<br> before we could...<br> Why didn't I think of that before?<br> - They can swim.<br> - What, elephants?<br> No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's<br> as big as an elephant that can swim?<br> A whale, sir.<br> Exactly.<br> Emma, get on<br> with the cough mixture.<br> - [Horse Whinnies, Sneezes]<br> - [Polynesia] Bless you.<br> Now, how do you get<br> in touch with a whale?<br> - [Grunting]<br> - I'll talk to him immediately.<br> Splendid.<br> Good morning. Marvelous,<br> if the giraffe doesn't mind.<br> - [Screeching]<br> - Extremely kind of you.<br> I do appreciate it.<br> - [Sneezes]<br> - Bless you.<br> You'll explain? Good.<br> Here he comes.<br> It was very decent of that turtle<br> to put us in touch with him.<br> [Willie]<br> My word! He's a big fellow.<br> Now, if he gave a shove below us,<br> that should just about do the trick.<br> [Whale Lows]<br> Good morning.<br> [Wails]<br> One... shove... here.<br> [Lowing]<br> We really must learn to speak<br> a few words of whale.<br> Apparently they're very nice,<br> but nobody ever talks to them.<br> [Squawking]<br> [Rumbling]<br> Look!<br> Why is it doing that?<br> The island is bound to roll<br> a bit after that shove.<br> It set that balancing rock<br> in motion.<br> - It'll soon calm down.<br> - That would be highly desirable.<br> It says here in the law book,<br> "He who causes the great rock<br> to fall into the hot mountain...<br> shall die the death<br> of 10,000 screams."<br> [Rumbling]<br> [Rock Crashing]<br> - Uh, how many screams did you say?<br> - 10,000.<br> I shouldn't have thought<br> it was worth more than five.<br> - I cannot tell you<br> how upset I am about this.<br> - You're upset?<br> We realize it isn't your fault.<br> I've been through the law book<br> from cover to cover.<br> There is nothing I can do.<br> - This is the tradition.<br> - Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.<br> I once heard a story about<br> a tribe that burned people alive,<br> then et them for dinner.<br> I bet that's what<br> they're going to do to us.<br> Will you please put a curb<br> on your lurid imagination?<br> I'm sorry about this, Emma.<br> It hasn't been very relaxing<br> the last few days, has it?<br> [Whimpering, Hooting, Squawking]<br> I think we've bumped<br> into something.<br> Stop!<br> Release them!<br> [Crowd Murmuring]<br> Holy Pat.<br> What did we do now?<br> We've collided with the mainland.<br> The two pieces fit perfectly.<br> - How extraordinary.<br> - Not really.<br> The oldest legend of the island<br> has always maintained...<br> that we are a bit of Africa<br> that has been missing for 5,000 years.<br> Is there a reward<br> for finding it?<br> Oh, indeed, yes.<br> "He who brings back<br> the lost island from the sea...<br> shall live as a god<br> for a thousand moons."<br> - [Applause]<br> - Thank you. Thank you.<br> That's very pleasant,<br> but if you will excuse me,<br> I must get back to the hospital,<br> in case the elephant sneezes<br> and blows all the other patients away.<br> - [Animal Moaning]<br> - What will you do when<br> the animals are all well again?<br> I have one great ambition.<br> I came to find a great pink sea snail.<br> I intend to find it.<br> The great pink sea snail<br> is more than mythical.<br> I always thought that,<br> too, Willie.<br> No, no. You can see<br> the animals as they come out.<br> - Guard the gate, Matthew.<br> - [Children] Oh!<br> Come on. Come on.<br> [Clears Throat]<br> - Why does he have the animals in there?<br> - All right, all right.<br> I'll tell ya.<br> Behind these gates is the most<br> wonderful place in all the world.<br> - Can we see it?<br> - Can we see it?<br> - Shh!<br> - Shh!<br> - [Brays]<br> - [Clucking]<br> - [Quacks]<br> - [Whinnies]<br> - [Squawks]<br> - [Whinnies]<br> - [Snorting]<br> [Lowing]<br> [Music] This is the world<br> of Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] The wonderful world<br> of Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] Where crocodiles talk<br> and elephants sing [music]<br> [Music] And animals do<br> most any old thing [music]<br> [Music] Where polar bears<br> wear top hats [music]<br> [Music] And leopards<br> with spots wear spats [music]<br> [Music] Well, that's life in<br> the world of Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] Doves start to coo<br> when they see Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] He has a profound philosophy [music]<br> [Music] If animals can be friends<br> says he [music]<br> [Music] Well, then why can't we [music]<br> Matthew, open the gate.<br> Come on, baby. Up!<br> [Children Chattering]<br> See they're all right, Matthew.<br> [Music] Say how do you do<br> to the world of Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Children] [music] Say how do you do<br> to the world of Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] Life is a zoo<br> to Dr. Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] Where antelopes lope [music]<br> [Squawks]<br> - [Music] And ostriches fan [music]<br> - [Music] And ostriches fan [music]<br> [Music] And kangaroos do<br> what kangaroos can [music]<br> - [Music] To make the hyenas laugh [music]<br> - [Polynesia Laughs]<br> [Music] As long as a long giraffe [music]<br> [Mooing]<br> [Music] Every calf starts to moo<br> when they see Dolittle [music]<br> [Music] Even the few<br> who used to moo little [music]<br> [Music] For all of the birds<br> and beasts agree [music]<br> [Music] He has a profound philosophy [music]<br> [Music]And so why can't [music]<br> - [Music] We [music]<br> - [Polynesia Squawks]<br> [Music] All of the birds<br> and beasts agree [music]<br> [Music] He has a profound philosophy [music]<br> [Music] And so why can't we [music]<br> [Music] Do little things to help them [music]<br> [Music] Why [music]<br> [Music] Can't [music]<br> [Off-key]<br> [Music] We [music]<br> - Oh.<br> - [Laughing]<br> Well, thank goodness<br> they only had head colds.<br> Think how terrible it would have been<br> if they'd had sore throats.<br> Our last two patients.<br> Well done, Emma.<br> - [Mooing]<br> - [Calf Bawls]<br> - [Children Laughing]<br> - [Cow Moos]<br> Well, not a sniffle left<br> on the island.<br> [Animal Sneezing]<br> Interesting noise. Can't be.<br> - You mean, the great pink sea snail...<br> - [Animal Sneezing]<br> Precisely, and by the sound of it,<br> he seems to have caught a chill too.<br> [Snail Sneezing]<br> [Snail Lowing]<br> [Lowing Continues]<br> - [Lowing Continues]<br> - So sorry.<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> - Yes, I see.<br> Well, just a minute. Amazing!<br> - What is?<br> We've been searching<br> for weeks for the great snail.<br> He's been with us all the time.<br> Lives in an underground cave<br> and moves about with the island.<br> I was quite right. He's got a shocking<br> cold. I told him I was a doctor,<br> and if he'd come on the beach,<br> I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.<br> It'll need to be<br> rather large, won't it?<br> [Snail Gulping]<br> - [Snail Reverberating]<br> - What's that?<br> - What is it?<br> - He's purring.<br> Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much<br> more relaxed, almost like a new snail.<br> - Wanted to know if there's<br> anything he can do for us.<br> - Is there?<br> Yes, he can take you all<br> safely back to Puddleby.<br> Oh, well. Well, that's<br> a bit of an imposition.<br> Puddleby's a long way away. All you did<br> was give him a little medicine.<br> He's 2,000 years old.<br> He's lonely. It'll be company for him.<br> He'd been planning<br> to visit his cousin in Scotland<br> for 300 years and put it off.<br> Be a great opportunity for him.<br> - His cousin in Scotland?<br> - You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, it's a cousin.<br> - Good heavens.<br> - [Matthew] Travel under the sea?<br> But it's bad enough on top.<br> We'd all drown, Doctor.<br> No, the shell is<br> completely watertight.<br> It'll be like traveling<br> in a big pink bubble.<br> Yes, he says he can get you back<br> to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.<br> This must be the only snail<br> in the world with four bedrooms.<br> Oh, and, Polynesia,<br> don't forget to remind<br> the snail to surface twice a day<br> for his cough mixture.<br> It will fix up his cold, and stretch<br> your legs and get some sea air.<br> - [Squawks] Yes, Doctor.<br> - Oh, good.<br> I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.<br> And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all<br> the bananas. Leave some for the others.<br> - [Moans]<br> - Shh, shh. Don't be sad.<br> [Matthew]<br> That's all, sir.<br> Good-bye, Stubbins.<br> Go up to the house whenever you like.<br> Yes, sir. And, Doctor,<br> come home soon, sir.<br> Well...<br> Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other<br> high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.<br> The snail can bring it<br> back with him.<br> Yours is looking<br> a little grubby now.<br> You'll probably find it<br> a bit difficult to get one here.<br> Yes, uh, probably.<br> Well, thank you, Matthew.<br> Well, uh, good-bye.<br> - [Polynesia Crying]<br> - Bye.<br> [Crying]<br> Uh, give my love<br> to everyone at home,<br> to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab<br> and everyone.<br> Good-bye, John Dolittle.<br> Take care!<br> Well, Tom, I still wish<br> he was comin' with us.<br> I've never driven<br> one of these things before.<br> [Children Laughing]<br> Sure you won't change your mind<br> and come with us?<br> I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me<br> away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.<br> But you have<br> to come back one day.<br> I hope so. A lot<br> of animals depend on me.<br> One or two people too.<br> Puddleby's going to seem<br> very dull after all this excitement.<br> I mean, what are you<br> going to do here?<br> I think I'll start<br> planning my next voyage.<br> Where are you going<br> this time? The moon?<br> - Very probably, yes.<br> - You're not serious.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - How?<br> On the giant lunar moth.<br> Magnificent creature.<br> Flies backwards and forwards<br> between the earth and the moon.<br> When it reaches one,<br> it's attracted by the light<br> of the other and flies back again.<br> Willie tells me<br> there's one on the island.<br> My idea is to build some sort<br> of saddle arrangement,<br> - very secure,<br> so I don't fall off halfway.<br> - Can I come?<br> Hmm?<br> Can I come with you?<br> Emma, I'm afraid...<br> I'm not very good with people.<br> L... I'm all right<br> with animals, but people...<br> [Sighs]<br> I'm not very good with.<br> I never have been.<br> I don't know why.<br> I'll write to you.<br> I'll organize an air postal service<br> with the seagulls.<br> I'll miss you, John Dolittle.<br> - [Crying]<br> - [Whimpering]<br> - [Polynesia Crying]<br> - [Crying]<br> Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.<br> If we ever drown in this thing,<br> it'll be in a flood of tears.<br> [Barking]<br> [Seal Barking]<br> Sophie. What are you doing here?<br> [Sophie Barks]<br> No. Oh, how do you do, sir?<br> Really? Good Lord.<br> Sophie, that's marvelous news.<br> Thank you very much, indeed.<br> [Seals Chattering]<br> Good-bye, Sophie.<br> Thank you. Thank you!<br> [Barks]<br> "Good night, sweet Prince, and flights<br> of angels sing thee to thy rest."<br> Willie! Willie!<br> Wonderful news.<br> Sophie, the seal,<br> and her husband have come to tell me...<br> all the animals in England<br> are on strike.<br> They refuse to do any work<br> until I'm reprieved.<br> - You can go home?<br> - Yes. The local magistrate<br> is begging me to go back.<br> The whole country's paralyzed<br> without the animals.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> I think that tree<br> is about the right size.<br> It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.<br> - But you've missed the snail.<br> - I've got a better idea.<br> I'm going to fly home.<br> Can you imagine their faces<br> when they see me on the quayside<br> waiting for them in Puddleby?<br> - Fly home?<br> - Since you say there's one<br> on the island, on the lunar moth.<br> - Help me make a model so I can<br> gauge where to put the saddle.<br> - Certainly.<br> I've got to allow for<br> a very steep rate of climb.<br> Now, you see,<br> you'll be the wings.<br> All of you. That's it.<br> Just sit down inside<br> those lines I've just drawn.<br> Everybody. That's the idea.<br> Good. Yes, I think<br> it's going to work splendidly.<br> As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll<br> go and have a chat with the lunar moth.<br> I only hope he understands<br> common house moth. That's all I speak.<br> Then as soon as the moon comes up,<br> we'll be off to Puddleby.<br> Wonderful night for flying.<br> By my calculations I should<br> be home in time for breakfast.<br> [Choir]<br> [Music]My friend the doctor says [music]<br> [Choir]<br> [Music]My friend the doctor says [music]<br> [Music] The stars are made<br> of lemon drops [music]<br> [Music] The bigger ones<br> are lollipops and ice [music]<br> [Music] The clouds have shops<br> up on the tops [music]<br> [Music] That sell you sweets<br> and soda pops [music]<br> [Music] What do they call the place<br> Isn't it paradise [music]<br> [Music]Maybe what the doctor tells me [music]<br> [Music]Isn't altogether true [music]<br> [Music]But I know every tale he tells me [music]<br> [Music]I don't know any better ones<br> Do you [music]<br> [Music]My friend the doctor says<br> the world is full of fantasy [music]<br> [Music]And who are you and I<br> to disagree [music]<br> [Music]Let's hope and pray<br> that is the way [music]<br> [Music] The life we love<br> will always stay [music]<br> [Music]For my friend the doctor [music]<br> [Music]And me [music]<br>
