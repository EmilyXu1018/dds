Oh, what a little hypocrite it is.<br> I'm going, now, Victor.<br> Whatever you like, dear.<br> You see, you'll always come back.<br> Stay, darling.<br> Stay.<br> Wake up! Here, take this.<br> You show it to someone<br> if you lose your way.<br> Professor Boris Kurt. And, you find him.<br> Now, go on.<br> Professor Boris Kurt.<br> But, Boris, this is genius.<br> Really, I thought it was Rachmaninoff?.<br> I'm going for a smoke.<br> And how's the general practitioner?<br> A bit scared of his finals.<br> Well, I don't think he need be.<br> How do you like the idea of marrying<br> a general practitioner?<br> I like it very much.<br> But no general practitioner has asked me.<br> No?<br> I thought you nomads were hot-blooded.<br> A slow lot, these general practitioners.<br> How do you fancy<br> a professor of pathology?<br> Does he write poetry?<br> Alas, no.<br> Then I'm afraid it's out of the question.<br> Excuse me.<br> That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.<br> Yes, I'd noticed.<br> It's for you.<br> How would the poet like to see<br> a bit of general practice?<br> Boris, thank God you've come.<br> This is very good of you, Boris.<br> Yes, I know it is. My assistant.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Where is she?<br> This way.<br> When did she do it?<br> About eight o'clock this evening.<br> Do you know what it was?<br> Why didn't you get a local doctor?<br> - I couldn't.<br> - No, I suppose you couldn't.<br> Come on in.<br> Turn her over.<br> All right.<br> Water.<br> Now, Yuri. Come on, dear. Come on.<br> Now, Yuri.<br> Come on, dear.<br> Come on, Yuri.<br> Sorry.<br> Well, my dear, that's it.<br> That's it. Good.<br> Good.<br> Good.<br> Is she going to live?<br> Water.<br> - She is, isn't she?<br> - Yes.<br> Funny thing.<br> There's a man, speaks on public platforms.<br> In with the government.<br> In with the Liberals. In with everybody.<br> And he risks it all.<br> For that!<br> That's not how poets see them, is it?<br> That's how GPs see them.<br> That's how they are.<br> You know, from here, she looks beautiful.<br> Zhivago, I think you're a hard case.<br> There's a child in the case.<br> A child. Her daughter.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris--<br> She might have thought about "Lara"<br> before she did it.<br> Does the girl know?<br> I'm afraid she does.<br> - Is she here?<br> - Yes.<br> Tell her that her mother's going to live.<br> Wait a minute, Victor. Yurian.<br> Yes, of course.<br> What are we going to say about this?<br> - Must we say anything?<br> - I'm afraid so.<br> I'm taking her to the hospital.<br> We'll have to say something.<br> You know that needn't be difficult, Boris.<br> - What is the name of your assistant?<br> - Zhivago.<br> Andreyevich?<br> Yes, why? Do you know him?<br> No, I knew his father slightly.<br> Fine.<br> Cheer up, Yuri. I'll have the poor bitch<br> in hospital tonight.<br> What's his name?<br> That's Victor Komarovsky.<br> He says he knows you.<br> He executed my father's will.<br> Uncle Alex turned it down.<br> By Komarovsky's account<br> there wasn't much in it.<br> And what there was<br> belonged to Komarovsky.<br> Oh, he's a very good businessman.<br> But I doubt that he's crooked.<br> Very good company. Knows life.<br> He's had a bad scare tonight.<br> You don't mind coming here, do you,<br> Victor Yppolitovich?<br> No, no. It reminds me of my youth.<br> - I went to the hospital again.<br> - And?<br> She wants you to go and forgive her.<br> For her suspicions.<br> You can tell her the truth<br> if you like, Larissa.<br> Is this him?<br> Yes.<br> - He knows nothing about--<br> - No.<br> Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.<br> Please.<br> - Will you eat?<br> - No, thank you.<br> I hope you don't think this is impertinent,<br> Pavel Pavlovich.<br> Not at all.<br> I am...I have been advising<br> Larissa's mother for many years.<br> I'm interested in what happens to her.<br> There's something I have to tell you.<br> And that is this:<br> I am committed to the Revolution.<br> Nothing...<br> ...not even Lara,<br> has more importance for me.<br> You misunderstand.<br> Your political views do not concern me.<br> So far as that goes, I'm probably<br> more in sympathy than you suppose.<br> I have a few contacts of my own,<br> which might surprise you.<br> How do you propose to live?<br> I've been offered a teaching post.<br> - May I know where?<br> - Gradov. It's in the Urals.<br> I know it. Not much of a place.<br> It's beautiful country,<br> Monsieur Komarovsky.<br> It'll be a quiet life, won't it?<br> That's what we want.<br> Well, you'll excuse me.<br> Will your salary be adequate?<br> Adequate. If not more.<br> Pavel Pavlovich, my chief impression is,<br> and I mean no offense...<br> ...is that you're very young.<br> Monsieur Komarovsky,<br> I hope I don't offend you.<br> Do people improve with age?<br> They grow a little more tolerant.<br> Because they have more<br> to tolerate in themselves.<br> If people don't marry young,<br> what do they bring to their marriage?<br> A little experience.<br> I'm 26. My mother died, needlessly,<br> when I was eight.<br> My father died in prison.<br> I have fended for myself.<br> I've worked my way<br> through higher school and university.<br> I am familiar with things<br> that you can hardly guess at.<br> All this is an experience<br> of a kind, certainly.<br> I've no amorous experience,<br> if that's what you mean.<br> None whatever. Lara's 17.<br> That speaks for itself.<br> You probably find this situation comic.<br> We don't.<br> We're going to be married next year.<br> I hope I haven't offended you<br> by speaking plainly.<br> Not at all. Admirable.<br> A young crusader.<br> Oh, he's not--<br> He's a very fine young man.<br> That's obvious.<br> You're very generous,<br> Monsieur Komarovsky.<br> Larissa, I want to talk to you.<br> Monsieur Komarovsky, will you--<br> I beg you.<br> Drop this affectation of addressing me<br> as "Monsieur Komarovsky"!<br> Under the circumstances,<br> I find it rather ridiculous.<br> Lara, I am determined to save you<br> from a dreadful error.<br> There are two kinds of men, and only two.<br> And that young man is one kind.<br> He is high-minded. He is pure.<br> He is the kind of man that the world<br> pretends to look up to and despises.<br> He's the kind of man who breeds<br> unhappiness, particularly in women.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - No.<br> I think you do.<br> There's another kind.<br> Not high-minded. Not pure, but alive.<br> That your tastes at this time should incline<br> toward the juvenile is understandable.<br> But, for you to marry that boy<br> would be a disaster.<br> Because, there are two kinds of women.<br> There are two kinds of women and you,<br> as we well know, are not the first kind.<br> You, my dear, are a slut.<br> I am not!<br> We'll see.<br> And, don't delude yourself<br> that this was rape.<br> That would flatter us both.<br> The master's not at home, Miss Lara.<br> Not at home?<br> No. He went to<br> the Sventytskis' Christmas party.<br> Are you going there, Miss?<br> Please don't say I told you.<br> No, thank you, Piotr.<br> Merry Christmas, Miss Lara.<br> Oh, thank you,<br> and Merry Christmas to you.<br> Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.<br> What's the matter?<br> We had an appointment this evening.<br> Where are you going?<br> Haven't you got the letter? I left a letter--<br> I've not been home. I'm going home, now.<br> Where're you going, Lara?<br> I've a right to know.<br> What's in this letter?<br> What's in this letter?<br> Are you breaking--<br> - It's all in the letter.<br> - What is?<br> Everything.<br> Don't!<br> Yuri, there's an extraordinary girl<br> at this party.<br> I know. I'm dancing with her.<br> You're keen tonight, Victor.<br> I like to win.<br> Silence!<br> Silence, everybody! Silence, please!<br> I have a very delightful announcement<br> to make.<br> Oh, Madame Sventytski!<br> Yes. Why not?<br> I have to announce that Dr. Yuri Zhivago--<br> Doctor Zhivago,<br> he came third in all Moscow.<br> Now, listen, please!<br> Dr. Zhivago is betrothed in marriage to--<br> My dear Victor!<br> My dear man!<br> Get her out.<br> What?<br> Get her out. Get her out!<br> Yes. Yes. I'll get the police.<br> No!<br> I don't want you to get the police.<br> I do not want the police.<br> I just want you to get her out!<br> Let her go!<br> Please!<br> Quiet, please. Please. Give way.<br> Please, would you mind?<br> Would you mind? Thank you, thank you.<br> Our destinies seem to be interwoven,<br> don't they?<br> Yes.<br> I was a close friend of your father.<br> I knew you were his business partner.<br> Rather more than that.<br> I was present at his death.<br> Also, I am in contact with your brother.<br> Yevgraf?.<br> I should say I'm in contact with those<br> who are in contact with him.<br> Oh, I disagree with Bolshevism.<br> Thank you.<br> You seem to know your trade.<br> But, I can still admire Bolsheviks, as men.<br> Shall I tell you why?<br> Yes.<br> They may win.<br> I'd like to meet him, Yevgraf.<br> He sent me a marvelous letter.<br> He likes my poetry.<br> That would have pleased your father.<br> Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.<br> If I may call you Yuri?<br> I hardly knew him.<br> You perhaps may not credit this...<br> ...but he was devoted to your mother.<br> I suppose I may continue to rely<br> on your professional discretion?<br> You mean, will I tell anyone the truth<br> about that girl?<br> That's what I mean, yes.<br> You may continue to rely<br> on my professional etcetera.<br> You are fastidious, aren't you?<br> What happens to a girl like that,<br> when a man like you is finished with her?<br> Interested?<br> I give her to you.<br> You shouldn't smoke. You've had a shock.<br> I give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.<br> A wedding present.<br> Where have you seen that girl before?<br> What makes you think<br> I've seen her before?<br> Haven't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Where?<br> I'm not supposed to say.<br> It was on a case. Not very nice.<br> No, don't tell me,<br> if you're not supposed to say.<br> In bourgeols terms It was a war<br> between the Allles and Germany.<br> In Bolshevlk terms It was a war between<br> the Allled and the German upper classes.<br> And, whlch of them won was<br> a matter ofIndlfference.<br> I was ordered by the Party to enllst.<br> I gave my name as Petrov.<br> They were shoutlng for vlctory<br> all over Europe...<br> ...praylng for vlctory, to the same God.<br> My task, the Party's task,<br> was to organlze defeat.<br> From defeat would sprlng the Revolutlon.<br> And, the Revolutlon would be<br> vlctory for us.<br> The Party looked<br> to the conscrlpt peasants...<br> ...most of them wearlng<br> thelr flrst good palr ofboots.<br> When the boots wore out,<br> they'd be ready to llsten.<br> When the tlme came, I was able to take<br> The best day's work I ever dld.<br> But, for the moment,<br> there was nothlng to be done.<br> There were too many volunteers llke me.<br> Mostly, It was mere hysterla.<br> But there were men wlth better motlves,<br> men who saw the tlmes were crltlcal...<br> ...and wanted a man's part.<br> Good men, wasted.<br> Unhappy men, too.<br> Unhappy In thelr jobs.<br> Unhappy wlth thelr wlves.<br> Doubtlng themselves.<br> Happy men don't volunteer.<br> They walt thelr turn and thank God<br> If thelr age, or work, delays It.<br> The ones who got back home wlth<br> the prlce of an arm or an eye or a leg...<br> ...these were the lucky ones.<br> Even Comrade Lenln...<br> ...underestlmated both<br> the angulsh of that 900- mlle- long front...<br> ...and our cursed capaclty for sufferlng.<br> By the second wInter of the war...<br> ...the boots had worn out...<br> ...but the llne stlll held.<br> Thelr great coats fell to pleces<br> on thelr backs.<br> Thelr ratlons were Irregular.<br> Half of them went lnto actlon<br> wlthout arms...<br> ...led by men they dldn't trust.<br> Come on, you bastards!<br> And, those they dld trust--<br> Come on, Comrades.

Earthshakers!<br> Show them!<br> Charge!<br> At last they dld what all the armles<br> dreamed of dolng:<br> They began to go home.<br> That was the beglnnlng of the Revolutlon.<br> Deserters.<br> Replacements.<br> Tote arms!<br> Come back.<br> Stick together!<br> Stick together and we'll be all right.<br> And be ready for them.<br> Turn around, lads!<br> - Don't go any farther.<br> - Come on, lads. Turn around.<br> Pigs to the slaughter! Look at you!<br> Turn around, lads.<br> Listen, lads.<br> Ten miles up that road are the Germans!<br> - Rubbish.<br> - Not rubbish.<br> They're coming.

Right.<br> Why did you volunteer?<br> - I came here to find my husband.<br> - Very gently.<br> - Have you ever seen an operation?<br> - Yes.<br> We'll manage.<br> They're in the next village, brothers.<br> The Germans.<br> - Your Honor--<br> - Keep still.<br> Did you find your husband?<br> No.<br> Your Honor...<br> Yes, we'd better be off.<br> You know, you often look at me<br> as though you knew me.<br> I have seen you.<br> Four years ago. Christmas Eve.<br> Were you there?<br> No wonder you look at me.<br> Did you know Victor Komarovsky?<br> Yes, I did. That young man,<br> who took you away--<br> My husband.<br> A lot of courage.<br> He made the rest of us look very feeble.<br> As a matter of fact, I thought you both did.<br> Good man to shoot at.<br> I'd give anything never to have met him.<br> The tsar's in prison.<br> Lenin's in Moscow.<br> Civil war has started.<br> Good!<br> Civil war, good?<br> Not good, Comrade Nurse, inevitable.<br> But Lenin in Moscow!<br> This Lenin, will he be the new tsar then?<br> Listen, Daddy.<br> No more tsars, no more masters.<br> Only workers in a worker's state.<br> How about that?<br> Are you a doctor?<br> - Yes.<br> - Follow me, please.<br> I can't deal with this.<br> Order of the Provisional Government.<br> You'll have to try, friend.<br> "If you could see how hard<br> we have been working here...<br> "...I feel sure you'd forgive me, dear,<br> for not writing more regularly."<br> When was that written?<br> July 20th.<br> Eight weeks!<br> "But now the war seems<br> really to have stopped.<br> "The hospital is emptying,<br> and I shall have more time.<br> "I may even get time to write some verse,<br> if I've not forgotten how to."<br> Oh, I do hope so!<br> "Larissa Antipova is still here,<br> and I admire her more and more.<br> "She seems to have the strange gift<br> of healing, which doctors don't believe in.<br> "She often does the wrong things,<br> but it always seems to work out right.<br> "How is Uncle Alex?<br> - "Can he still get his English tobacco?"<br> - Would that he could!<br> "Can Sasha say his letters yet?<br> And how is Auntie Anna?"<br> He didn't get my letter.<br> "Most of all, my dearest, how are you?"<br> Strangely upsetting.<br> He doesn't know she's dead.<br> Can't see what difference it makes.<br> They're at it again!<br> I wish they'd decide once and for all...<br> ...which gang of hooligans constitutes<br> the government of this country!<br> Cheer up, Sergei.<br> Don't you want to go home?<br> There's fighting at home, Your Honor.<br> I've had enough.<br> Red Guards and White Guards,<br> this old man's had enough.<br> Your Honor is a kind gentleman.<br> And, the nurse is a kind lady.<br> Finished?<br> Just about.<br> In a couple of weeks<br> you'll be with your little girl.<br> If I can get on a train.<br> I want to be with Katya<br> more than anything in the world.<br> Yes, of course.<br> But, now that we're going, I feel sad.<br> Sad.<br> Really sad.<br> - Well, we've been here some time.<br> - Yes.<br> This must have been a lovely house, once.<br> Don't you think?<br> What are you going to do?<br> In Gradov?<br> Yes.<br> I'll be all right.<br> I wish I could think so.<br> You could run a laundry.<br> What will you do?<br> I suppose I'll go back to the hospital.<br> It's funny to think of you there.<br> I used to pass it on my way to school.<br> Do you ever come to Moscow?<br> From Gradov?<br> If only there were someone<br> to look after you.<br> Of course, if there were,<br> I'd be destroyed by jealousy.<br> Zhivago, don't.<br> My dear, don't, please!<br> Now, look what you've made me do.<br> We've been together six months,<br> on the road and here...<br> ...and we've not done anything<br> you'll have to lie about to Tonya.<br> I don't want you to have to lie about me.<br> You understand that, Yuri?<br> You understand everything.<br> Come on, Comrades!

It's on--<br> - The Second Reformed Hospital.<br> Good. It needed reforming.<br> Medicals report<br> to their place of work at once.<br> Yes. I believe there's typhus?<br> You've been listening<br> to rumormongers, Comrade.<br> There is no typhus in our city.<br> Well, that's good news.<br> I'll report tomorrow.<br> When you've started work,<br> you'll get a ration book.<br> I've always worked.<br> Whatever is the matter?<br> You are.<br> There was living space for 13 families<br> in this one house.<br> Yes.

Coffee, you observe.<br> Stop it, Daddy. He knows I'm a marvel.<br> Did you write any poetry?<br> Quite a lot.<br> Is it good?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> Can I see it?<br> Well, of course.<br> What happened to Nurse Antipova?<br> Your letters were full of her.<br> Yes, I suppose they were.<br> That's the girl who shot<br> friend Komarovsky, isn't it?<br> Yes, Daddy. You know it is.<br> She's gone home to her little girl.<br> - Oh, we shan't see her then?<br> - No.<br> What a pity!<br> Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.<br> What I don't understand is<br> how we're going to stay alive this winter.<br> You have no right whatever<br> to call me from work.<br> As a Soviet deputy, I--<br> That gives you the power, not the right.<br> It's noticed, you know.<br> Your attitude is noticed.<br> You should have called the area doctor.<br> I want this done quietly.<br> Why, what is it, typhus?<br> I'll take him away. Get me some transport.<br> It isn't typhus.<br> It's another disease<br> we don't have in Moscow: starvation.<br> That seems to give you satisfaction.<br> It would give me satisfaction<br> to hear you admit it.<br> - Would it? Why?<br> - Because it is so.<br> Your attitude is noticed, you know.<br> Oh, yes, it's been noticed.<br> Hello.<br> The stove's out!<br> The stove's out!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> No wonder he's losing weight!<br> She lets it out as soon as you've gone,<br> and she lights it before you come home.<br> We haven't enough fuel.<br> I told myselflt was beneath my dlgnlty<br> to arrest a man for pllferlng flrewood.<br> But nothlng ordered by the Party<br> Is beneath the dlgnlty of any man...<br> ...and the Party was rlght.<br> One man desperate for a blt of fuel<br> Is pathetlc.<br> Flve mllllon people desperate for fuel<br> wlll destroy a clty.<br> That was the flrst tlme<br> I ever saw my brother.<br> But, I knew hlm,<br> and I knew that I would dlsobey the Party.<br> Perhaps It was the tle ofblood<br> between us, but I doubt It.<br> We were only half-tled, anyway,<br> and brothers wlll betray a brother.<br> Indeed, as a pollceman, I would say<br> "Get hold of a man's brother...<br> "...and you're half way home.

Yes. The policeman.<br> I didn't know that.<br> Perhaps not. A "secret" policeman.<br> Did he send you here?<br> Yevgraf?.<br> No, Yevgraf's a Bolshevik.<br> I don't know anything about these things.<br> Oh, you know a great deal.<br> When you came in you recognized me.<br> How?<br> Has someone shown you photographs?<br> No.<br> I am certain that you recognized me.<br> I've seen you before, Commander.<br> When?<br> Six years ago.<br> Go on.<br> Christmas Eve. You--<br> You were there?<br> Or, has someone told you this?<br> I attended to the man<br> who was injured by your wife.<br> Why do you call her my wife?<br> I met her again.<br> We served together on the Ukranian Front.<br> If she's with you,<br> I'm sure she'd vouch for me.<br> I haven't seen her since the war.<br> She's in Yuriatin.<br> Yuriatin!<br> The private life is dead,<br> for a man with any manhood.<br> We saw a sample of your manhood<br> on the way, a place called Mink.<br> They were selling horses to the Whites.<br> No.<br> It seems you burned the wrong village.<br> They always say that.<br> And what does it matter?<br> A village betrays us, a village is burnt.<br> The point's made.<br> Your point, their village.<br> Kolya!<br> And what will you do<br> with your wife and child in Varykino?<br> Just live.<br> Take him away. He's innocent.<br> You're lucky.<br> We've been diverted.<br> Do you know where we're going?<br> Varykino Halt.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> How lovely!<br> Oh, how lovely!<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Alexander Maximiovich?<br> Yes.<br> It's me, Petya.<br> Your Honor!<br> Now, now, now,<br> that's all done with, you know.<br> How do we get to the house, Petya?<br> As you always did, Your Honor.<br> Look, Sasha!<br> What is it, Petya? Forest fire?<br> Forest fire, Your Honor?<br> That's Yuriatin.<br> Poor souls.<br> First the Reds, then the Whites.<br> Now, the Reds again.<br> That's Strelnikov. His heart must be dead.<br> We'll soon be there, now, Sasha.<br> Another five miles.<br> Is it that far? One forgets.<br> How is the place?<br> Oh, well enough, Your Honor.<br> It's all locked up, you know.<br> Varykino!<br> All locked up, you see.<br> A body, styling itself.<br> The Yuriatin Committee<br> of Revolutionary Justice...<br> ...has expropriated my house<br> in the name of the people.<br> Very well.<br> I'm one of the people, too!<br> Don't, Your Honor!<br> They'd call it counterrevolution.<br> - Get out of my way!<br> - Father, don't!<br> Petya brought us here.<br> That makes him<br> a counterrevolutionary, too.<br> They shoot counterrevolutionaries.<br> It's not the Reds in the town,<br> it's the Reds in the forest.<br> - Partisans.<br> - Here?<br> Who knows? They go where they want,<br> and they do what they want.<br> All we need is a roof, Petya.<br> And a bit of garden. Is there nowhere?<br> They didn't lock the cottage.<br> Oh, yes, we can manage here.<br> Oh, the stove works.<br> I'll find you a few sticks of furniture.<br> And some seed potatoes?<br> I'm afraid the garden is dreadfully run back.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Well done, my boy.<br> I must say, scratch a Russian<br> and you'll find a peasant.<br> I've always said so.<br> Well, you're wrong.<br> He works like a peasant,<br> but he isn't a peasant.<br> I don't mind, Tonya. Really.<br> - It's a good life.<br> - It certainly is.<br> I wouldn't be surprised if you two didn't<br> look back on this time as one of your best.<br> Awfully glad about the expected<br> new arrival, Yuri.<br> Anna was born here, you know.<br> Oh, no, I didn't know that.<br> Well, I'm terribly glad.<br> Here's winged Mercury.<br> Looks a bit down in the mouth.<br> Enter.<br> What news from Yuriatin?<br> There's no lard, no sugar.<br> Oil, next week, perhaps.<br> There's flour, salt, coffee and nails.<br> Bad news?<br> Oh, Lord, not another purge!<br> No.<br> Strelnikov's gone.<br> That's not bad news.<br> No. He's in Manchuria, they say.<br> That's the news.<br> They've shot the tsar.<br> And all his family.<br> Oh, that's a savage deed.<br> What's it for?<br> It's to show there's no going back.<br> Yuri, why don't you go to Yuriatin?<br> Yes, why don't you, my boy?<br> It'd do you good.<br> Why? What's in Yuriatin?<br> It isn't Petersburg.<br> A very decent little library...<br> ...if it's still there.<br> I wish you would.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> Anyway, the roads are blocked.<br> Zhivago?<br> Yes.<br> How are you?<br> What are you doing here?<br> We're at Varykino.<br> Varykino?<br> Why Varykino?<br> Why not? We had to go somewhere.<br> But, here!<br> I came here to find my husband.<br> The one who was reported killed.<br> Strelnikov. I met him.<br> Met him?<br> Yes.<br> How long have you been living here?<br> About a year.<br> Alone?<br> With Katya.<br> Where's Katya now?<br> At school.<br> Is Tonya with you?<br> All of us.<br> Sasha?<br> Of course.<br> What are we going to do?<br> I don't know.<br> Yuri?<br> It's awfully early, isn't it?<br> Half past six.<br> What are you doing?<br> Nothing. Couldn't sleep.<br> Is anything the matter?<br> No.<br> Shall I get some tea?<br> Yes, do.<br> Hello. You are silly. We called and called.<br> - Did you? I didn't hear.<br> - Well, we did.<br> - Hello, Lara.<br> - Hello.<br> How's Olya Petrovna?<br> She gets worse and worse.<br> She gave us C.I. and arithmetic<br> all morning.<br> C.I.?<br> Civic Instruction.<br> Look.<br> - That's very good, Katya.<br> - Thank you.<br> It's the tsar.<br> The tsar was an enemy of the people.<br> Well, he didn't know he was an enemy<br> of the people, you know.<br> Well, he should have known, shouldn't he?<br> Yes, he should.<br> Fancy not knowing C.I.<br> Doesn't your little boy go to school?<br> Lunch.<br> Good.<br> Come on, you.<br> Smell.<br> This one's a prize-fighter.<br> Yuri!<br> Wait a minute.<br> There.<br> I'm going in to Yuriatin, darling--<br> What? Now?<br> Yes, I want to get some morphine,<br> disinfectant...<br> I shan't need morphine.<br> You never know.<br> Well, I shan't need it today.<br> No. But, it's pretty close.<br> I hadn't realized it.<br> - You'll be back before it's dark?<br> - Long before.<br> Yes, yes, my darling. Do what's best.<br> I'm not coming back.<br> I understand.<br> But, never, Lara.<br> Do you understand?<br> Do you believe me?<br> Comrade Doctor, I need a medical officer.<br> Sorry. I have a wife and child in Varykino.<br> And a mistress in Yuriatin.<br> Comrade Medical Officer,<br> we are Red Partisans...<br> ...and we shoot deserters. Up!<br> Up!<br> - Where are you taking me?<br> - To the Front.<br> - And where is the Front?<br> - Good question.<br> The Front is wherever there are<br> enemies of the Revolution.<br> Wherever there is one gang<br> of White Guards...<br> ...one battalion of foreign interventionists,<br> that is the Front.<br> Wherever there is one resentful<br> bourgeois, one unreliable schoolmaster...<br> ...one dubious poet hugging his private life.<br> That, too, is the Front.<br> How long are you going to keep me?<br> For as long as we need you.<br> Now!<br> Charge!<br> Well, that was easy. Come on, Doctor,<br> let's see what we've done.<br> "St. Michael's Military School."<br> You old bastard!<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Did you ever love a woman, Razin?<br> I once had a wife and four children.<br> He has been a good comrade.<br> He's been a good medical officer.<br> We took him from his wife,<br> we took him from his child.<br> None of this matters.<br> What does matter, Comrade Commissar?<br> Tell me, I've forgotten.<br> This is contemptible. The doctor stays.<br> I command this unit!<br> We command jointly.<br> The "Party Bulletin" expressly states--<br> I could have you taken out and shot.<br> And could you have the Party<br> taken out and shot?<br> Try to understand.<br> As the military struggle nears its close,<br> the political struggle intensifies.<br> In the hour of victory<br> the military will have served its purpose.<br> All men will then be judged politically...<br> ...regardless of their military record.<br> Meanwhile, there are still White units<br> in this area.<br> The doctor stays.<br> That concludes the meeting.<br> Comrade, where are you going?<br> Are you running away, Comrade?<br> Soldiers.<br> Red soldiers or White soldiers?<br> Soldiers.<br> Tonya!<br> Tonya!<br> Sasha!<br> Tonya!<br> Tonya!<br> Tonya!<br> Tonya!<br> Tonya!<br> This is Yuriatin?<br> Yes. Yuriatin.<br> What's happened at Varykino?<br> The Moscow folks?<br> Yes.<br> They've gone away. Gone away.<br> There's nobody at Varykino.<br> Lord what happiness!<br> They say you are alive.<br> Someone saw you near the Town.<br> I take it you have gone to Varykino,<br> so I'm going there myself with Katya.<br> But just in case, I've left a little food,<br> boiled potatoes mostly.<br> Put the lid back on the pan<br> or the rats will get it.<br> Oh, I'm mad with joy.<br> Tonya!<br> Tonya!<br> Yuri.<br> Tonya!<br> Yuri. Yuri, darling.<br> It's all right, Yuri. They're safe.<br> They're in Moscow.<br> - In Moscow?<br> - Yes.<br> - Tonya?<br> - All of them.<br> They're safe.<br> Safe.<br> Firing squad--<br> Better.<br> What?<br> I've got a letter for you.<br> I've had it three months.<br> And it was three months getting here.<br> It's from Moscow.<br> I think it's from Tonya.<br> It's addressed to you. Care of me.<br> She came into Yuriatin to find you<br> when you vanished.<br> Someone sent her here.<br> You met?<br> She's very fine.<br> My dearest dear...<br> ...I am sending this to Larissa Antipova...<br> ...because if you are alive,<br> which God grant...<br> ...I think that is where you will go.<br> We have a little daughter, Yuri,<br> did you know?<br> Her name is Anna.<br> Father sends greetings.<br> Sasha has grown quite a lot.<br> He is quite big now.<br> Whenever we speak of you<br> he weeps and won't be comforted.<br> This is what I have to tell you.<br> We are being deported from Russia.<br> We can't make out<br> if you would be allowed to join us.<br> An organization in Paris<br> which I mustn't name...<br> ...will know where we are...<br> ...but nothing is certain<br> and there is very little time.<br> I am writing this in haste.<br> They are coming for us now.<br> God bless you.<br> I must honestly admit<br> that Antipova is a good person.<br> Yuri, when they got away to Moscow,<br> she left something here.<br> Yuri!<br> May I come in?<br> Yuri Andreyevich, you've changed, I think.<br> Oh, yes, decidedly.<br> Larissa...<br> ...remarkably the same.<br> I came from Moscow.<br> I'm on my way to Vladivostock.<br> I'm here to offer you my help.<br> We don't want it.<br> Speak for yourself.<br> We don't want it.<br> Yuri Andreyevich, you spent two years<br> with the Partisans, Fifth Division.<br> You have no discharge<br> so you are a deserter.<br> Your family in Paris is involved<br> in a dangerous migr organization.<br> Now all these are technicalities.<br> But your style of life...<br> ...everything you say and think...<br> ...your published writings<br> are all flagrantly subversive.<br> Your days are numbered.<br> Unless I help you.<br> Do you want my help?<br> No.<br> Wait, Yuri.<br> Larissa, three glasses.<br> No!<br> Yuri, you must see how serious this is.<br> Please don't underestimate me.<br> Practically, or morally,<br> I am not the man you take me for.<br> How do you know all this about Yuri?<br> How can you help?<br> I do and I can. Isn't that sufficient?<br> No.<br> Sant, Larissa.<br> Our eastern seaboard is<br> an undeveloped area.<br> The Commissariat of Foreign Affairs wants<br> to establish an independent state there.<br> It affords us a temporary channel<br> of communication with the outside world.<br> I've good contacts in the Far East.<br> I've been appointed the minister of justice.<br> The Bolsheviks trust you?<br> They trust no one.<br> They've found me useful.<br> Here's how I can help you.<br> You...<br> You come with me<br> as far as the Pacific Coast.<br> And from there you can go where you like.<br> To Paris.<br> Or not.<br> I think you'd better go.<br> Your rarified selfishness is intolerable.<br> Larissa's in danger, too.<br> By association with me?<br> No. Not by association with you.<br> You're small fry.<br> By association with Strelnikov.<br> I've never met Strelnikov.<br> You're married to Strelnikov.<br> They know that.<br> I was married to Pasha Antipov.<br> I understand, I understand.<br> But they don't.<br> You're being watched.<br> Do you know why?<br> A husband is a sticky commodity, my dear.<br> Go away!<br> More of your high-minded lunacy.<br> You have a child to think of.<br> Look here.<br> Here.<br> That's sugar for the child.<br> I don't want it.<br> You'd refuse my sugar?<br> Who are you to refuse me anything?<br> Now you go!<br> - I came--<br> - Go!<br> Go!<br> I came to you in good faith.<br> You stay here then and get your desserts!<br> Your desserts, do you hear me?<br> You think you're immaculate.<br> You're not immaculate!<br> I know you!<br> Do you hear me?<br> We're all made of the same clay, you know.<br> Clay!<br> Clay!<br> Lara.<br> He's rubbish, Lara.<br> Yes, rubbish.<br> I wish he'd never happened.<br> Does it matter?<br> Doesn't it?<br> Not to me.<br> What shall we do? Can we get on a train?<br> No, they'd arrest us on the spot.<br> I don't want to stay here and wait.<br> No.<br> Listen.<br> - We could go to--<br> - Varykino.<br> They'd find out sooner or later.<br> Yes, but later.<br> And if our days are really numbered, Yuri--<br> Yes. We'd better live them.<br> Before we're parted.<br> Yes.<br> Anna taught me to write at this desk.<br> This isn't me, Yuri.<br> Yes, it is.<br> No.<br> It's you.<br> "Lara."<br> Yuri!<br> Yuri, there's a wolf howling!<br> Oh, yes.<br> I've seen them. They're frightened.<br> They won't harm us.<br> Yes. I know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, Lord, this is an awful time to be alive.<br> No.<br> It is. Oh, it is!<br> No. No.<br> Wouldn't it have been lovely<br> if we'd met before?<br> Before we did?<br> Yes.<br> We'd have got married<br> and had a house and children.<br> If we'd had children, Yuri,<br> would you have liked a boy or a girl?<br> I think we may go mad,<br> if we think about all that.<br> I shall always think about it.<br> - Will you write today?<br> - No, not today.<br> Katya!<br> Come to me, darling.<br> Victor!<br> We thought it was--<br> Quiet.<br> I wonder if you'd mind, Comrades?<br> There's a train belonging<br> to my government standing in Yuriatin.<br> It has a carriage for myself<br> and my assistants.<br> You would travel in comfort and safety.<br> There's no question.<br> I'm not going with you.<br> I'm not going without you.<br> So, there's an end to it.<br> Well, then, I'll have to speak<br> to Yuri Andreyevich in private.<br> Strelnikov is dead.<br> What?<br> Spare me your expressions of regret.<br> He was a murderous neurotic<br> and no loss to anyone.<br> Do you see how this affects Larissa?<br> You don't.<br> You're a fool.<br> She's Strelnikov's wife.<br> Why do you think they haven't<br> arrested her? Is this the usual practice?<br> Why do you think<br> they had her watched in Yuriatin?<br> They were waiting for Strelnikov.<br> If they thought that he would<br> come running to his wife...<br> ...they didn't know him.<br> They knew him well enough.<br> He was only five miles from here<br> when they caught him.<br> He was arrested on the open road.<br> He didn't conceal his identity.<br> Throughout the entire interview,<br> he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov...<br> ...which is his right name, and refused<br> to answer to the name of Strelnikov.<br> On his way to execution,<br> he took a pistol from one of the guards...<br> ...and blew his own brains out.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Don't tell Lara this.<br> I think I know Lara at least as well as you.<br> But don't you see her position?<br> She's served her purpose.<br> These men that came with me today<br> as an escort...<br> ...will come for her and the child tomorrow,<br> as a firing squad.<br> Now, I know exactly what you think of me.<br> And why.<br> But if you're not coming with me,<br> she's not coming with me.<br> So, are you coming with me?<br> Do you accept the protection<br> of this ignoble Caliban...<br> ...on any terms that Caliban cares to make?<br> Or, is your delicacy so exorbitant that you<br> would sacrifice a woman and a child to it?<br> There are some bags to carry, Comrades.<br> Get in!<br> Come.<br> - How many?<br> - All of us.<br> Sorry, not enough room.<br> Comrade, there's got to be room.<br> It's all right, I have to bring our sledge.<br> Hurry. This train can't wait.<br> There are important people on it.<br> You start, I'll catch you up.<br> Right, Comrades!<br> We'll see you.<br> Hurry!<br> I'm afraid that's it, my dear.<br> Your young man's not coming.<br> You fool!<br> Did you really think<br> he would come with you?<br> The man's an idiot.<br> From Mongolia<br> he could have gone to China.<br> He'll never leave Russia.<br> Let him stay.<br> You've come with me, haven't you?<br> Yes.<br> To be sure, it was your duty as a mother.<br> That's right, Victor.<br> I'm carrying Yuri's child.<br> I was born out there,<br> in the Far East, somewhere.<br> I think it was Mongolia. I don't remember.<br> You were born in Mongolia.<br> And you were born that very year.<br> So were a lot of other children.<br> Not many called Tonya, bearing the name<br> Komarov, or Komarovsky.<br> Komarov's a common name. So is Tonya.<br> With fair hair and blue eyes,<br> lost at the age of eight...<br> ...when the civil war broke out<br> in the Far East.<br> There's something you haven't told me.<br> How did you come to be lost?<br> I can't remember.<br> I don't believe that.<br> You must remember something.<br> No!<br> Shall I tell you<br> how I first met your mother?<br> If she was my mother, Comrade General.<br> You doubt it?<br> I picked my brother up, literally picked<br> him up, on a Moscow street.<br> He had a fourth-class ration book<br> and he was undernourished.<br> He didn't seem to mind that, or anything.<br> I thought he was a happier man than me.<br> He suffered me to buy him a new suit.<br> And to get him a job at his old hospital.<br> I saw him off for his first day's work.<br> This was eight years<br> after he and Lara parted.<br> So, he never saw her again?<br> Thank you. You've been very kind to me.<br> He must have known how ill he was.<br> The walls of his heart were like paper.<br> But, he kept it to himself.<br> He kept a lot to himself.<br> Please!<br> I was astonished at the extent<br> of his reputation.<br> His work was unobtainable at the time.<br> It was disapproved ofby the Party.<br> But, ifpeople love poetry, they love poets.<br> And nobody loves poetry like a Russian.<br> Excuse me, Comrade.<br> Are you Yevgraf?.<br> My name's Lara.<br> I knew her name from the Lara poems...<br> ...which I'd found<br> among my brother's manuscripts.<br> I knew your brother.<br> I need your help.<br> She'd come to Moscow<br> to look for her child.<br> I helped her as far as I could.<br> But, I knew it was hopeless.<br> I think I was a little in love with her.<br> One day she went away<br> and didn't come back.<br> She died, or vanished, somewhere...<br> ...in one of the labor camps...<br> ...a nameless number on a list<br> that was afterwards mislaid.<br> That was quite common in those days.<br> How did you come to be lost?<br> - We were running in the street.<br> - We?<br> - My father.<br> - Not your father, Komarovsky.<br> I don't know.<br> The street was under fire.<br> There were explosions<br> and the houses were falling down...<br> ...and he let go of my hand.<br> He let go of my hand.<br> And I was lost.<br> Would a father have done that?<br> Oh, yes, people will do anything.<br> It was Komarovsky.<br> This man was your father.<br> Why won't you believe it?<br> Don't you want to believe it?<br> Not if it isn't true.<br> That's inherited.<br> Comrade General, when I was a child,<br> I wanted parents.<br> You can imagine how I wanted parents.<br> I wanted to die when I was a child,<br> you know?<br> Now, I don't know.<br> I can't be of any use to them, now, can I?<br> I was hoping I might be<br> of some use to you.<br> Will you think about it?<br> Yes.<br> It's all right, David.<br> Do you work here?<br> Yes, Comrade General. I'm an operator.<br> And what do you operate?<br> That!<br> You've promised to think about it.<br> Tonya!<br> Can you play the balalaika?<br> Can she play?<br> She's an artist!<br> An artist? Who taught you?<br> No one taught her.<br> Then, it's a gift.<br>
