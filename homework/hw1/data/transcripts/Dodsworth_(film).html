                        - Mr. Dodsworth?<br> - Yes?<br> The men are ready.<br> I hate to see you go, Sam.<br> Good-bye, Sam.<br> See if you can slip them into<br> Mr. Dodsworth's big leather suitcase.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> And when Miss Emily and Mr. McKee<br> come back from their honeymoon...<br> I've put all the wedding presents<br> in her old room.<br> - Yes, Mrs. Dodsworth.<br> - Oh, and the...<br> Good afternoon, sir.<br> - Mr. Dodsworth's paper?<br> - Right here, ma'am.<br> Over there.<br> Is everything settled?<br> The Dodsworth Motor Company, Samuel<br> Dodsworth, president and founder...<br> became the property of Union Motors<br> a little over an hour ago.<br> How do you feel?<br> How would any man feel<br> who just sold 20 years of his life?<br> I suppose you feel kind of lost.<br> I knew what I was doing when I sold,<br> and I know what I'm after from now on.<br> Oh, Sam, don't look<br> so mournful, darling.<br> All right, Mary.<br> I'll fix you a drink.<br> Just think, Sammy, you're free.<br> After 20 years of doing<br> what was expected of us, we're free.<br> I'm just as keen on this trip<br> as you are. I'm rarin' to go.<br> I've always wanted<br> to see London and Paris.<br> I want much more<br> than a trip out of this, Sam.<br> I want a new life,<br> all over from the very beginning.<br> A perfectly glorious,<br> free, adventurous life.<br> It's coming to us.<br> We've done our job.<br> We've brought up Emily and seen her<br> married. We've got plenty of money.<br> Why, if we weren't tied to<br> this half-baked Middle Western town...<br> - Fran, don't start knocking Zenith.<br> - Darling, I'm not knocking Zenith.<br> But have you ever thought<br> what Zenith means to me?<br> You go down to the plant and deal<br> in millions and have a marvelous time.<br> I go down to the kitchen<br> and order dinner.<br> Then there's the ladies' luncheon<br> and bridge, always the same ladies.<br> Then dinner... same people<br> we dined with last week.<br> After dinner, poker for the men<br> and women for the women.<br> There's talk of children and doctors<br> and servants and the garden club...<br> Thought you liked<br> the garden club.<br> I can't go on liking<br> the same things forever and ever.<br> Oh, Sammy darling, I want all<br> the lovely things I've got a right to.<br> In Europe, a woman of my age<br> is just to the point...<br> where men begin to take<br> a serious interest in her.<br> I won't be put on the shelf<br> for my daughter...<br> when I can still dance longer<br> and better than she can.<br> After all, I've got brains and,<br> thank heavens, I've still got looks.<br> Nobody takes me for over 32...<br> Oh, Sammy darling,<br> I'm begging for life.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I'm demanding it.<br> I see how you feel.<br> All right, I'll enjoy life now<br> if it kills me, and it probably will.<br> I spy you, European travelers.<br> Got a little spaghetti?<br> - Hello, Tubby.<br> - Hello, Matey. Hello, Tubby.<br> - We're going with you.<br> - You're not.<br> - As far as New York.<br> - What?<br> - Can't you offer a fellow a drink?<br> - Get Tubby a drink.<br> Will you excuse me?<br> I won't be two seconds.<br> - Can I help?<br> - I'll be right back.<br> Run along anyway.<br> Run along.<br> - All right, say when.<br> - I don't want a drink.<br> - What's wrong?<br> - I'll stay sober till I bawl you out.<br> - What have I done?<br> - You know very well.<br> Union Motors people been to the bank<br> to see me about you.<br> What are they running<br> around to you about me for?<br> They want me to use my influence<br> with you as your banker.<br> Don't blame me<br> if it doesn't do any good.<br> They offered to make you first<br> vice president of the whole outfit...<br> in charge of production<br> of all their cars...<br> They offered me $100,000 the first year<br> in addition to stock which comes to...<br> - You turned it down?<br> - Yeah.<br> Americans like you and me<br> can't quit, Sam.<br> It's meant that we should keep on<br> working until we die in harness.<br> I'm out to make a new life<br> for myself.<br> I'm out to learn how to enjoy<br> my leisure, now I've retired.<br> I've been doing things people expected<br> of me always. I want to feel free.<br> I want to sit under a linden tree with<br> nothing more important to worry about...<br> than the temperature of the beer,<br> if there is anything more important.<br> If you think I can see<br> my oldest and closest friend...<br> turned into<br> an expatriate parlor snake...<br> because Zenith isn't<br> good enough for his wife...<br> Ever since college, I've yessed you<br> and looked up to you. You're a big man.<br> You're a great industrialist.<br> You're a representative citizen.<br> You're pretty near everything<br> I'm not and ought to be.<br> But about your wife, you're<br> the dumbest, the sappiest, the most...<br> It's all right, Matey.<br> Tubby's famous for his very<br> peculiar brand of humor, aren't you?<br> It's all right. I'm glad you heard<br> what I said. Sam knows as well as I do...<br> I don't know<br> anything of the kind.<br> I'm out to see the world I haven't seen<br> and get a perspective on the USA.<br> I might get to know myself<br> at the same time.<br> I might even get to know my wife.<br> Oh, come along, Tubby.<br> We'll be seeing you on the boat.<br> - You won't see me there.<br> - Put that glass down too.<br> - See here.<br> - I'm not going.<br> Did I remember to tell you today<br> that I adore you?<br> - Mother!<br> - Why, look who's arrived!<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - We thought you were in Nassau.<br> - We were yesterday.<br> - Yesterday?<br> - You broke off the honeymoon?<br> - Emily had had enough honeymoon.<br> I don't think so much of sending a girl<br> off with a husband she doesn't know.<br> - How'd you get here so soon?<br> - We decided to surprise you. We flew.<br> You flew? I don't want you<br> flying around in airplanes.<br> - I'm not taking any chances on you.<br> - It's Harry's job to worry about me now.<br> I don't know whether this is going<br> to make going away harder or easier.<br> A little of both.<br> Don't see why<br> we don't rate a honeymoon.<br> Wait till you have a honeymoon<br> All visitors ashore, please.<br> All ashore that's going ashore.<br> We just got here!<br> - I saw them. They're right near the top.<br> - Hey, Emily!<br> - There they are.<br> - Oh, yes! I see.<br> Bye!<br> - Fran? Fran! We're at sea!<br> - At sea? That's putting it mildly.<br> Forget this trunk.<br> Come on out and see the ship.<br> - You sound happy. I'm so glad.<br> - This is the happiest day of my life!<br> Of course, except<br> the day I married you.<br> Get off my dress.<br> Do you realize this is the first time<br> we've started out together as lovers?<br> - I was right, wasn't I?<br> - Yeah, no more work.<br> - Now we'll live.<br> - Together.<br> - Always.<br> - Let's look at the ship.<br> I can't. I got to dress<br> for dinner and so have you.<br> - We have to dress for dinner?<br> - Of course. Don't you want to?<br> Well, okay.<br> Remember the first time I asked you<br> to marry me and we said we'd come here?<br> And here we are.<br> I love you more than ever now that<br> I've got time for it.<br> And I love you, Sammy.<br> - Looks like I made a slight error.<br> - That's all right, sir.<br> Dry martini, please.<br> - Mr. Dodsworth?<br> - Yes.<br> I heard you were on board. I hope<br> you don't mind me introducing myself.<br> Not at all.<br> I've just been driving one of your cars<br> all through South America.<br> - How'd it stand up?<br> - Tough as nails.<br> Good.<br> - My name's Lockert.<br> - Good to know you.<br> - Join me in a drink?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - Dry martini.<br> - Make it two, please.<br> - All right, sir.<br> I'm waiting for my wife.<br> - I hope I'm not intruding.<br> - Not at all. Here she comes now.<br> - Dear.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> I want you to meet Mr. Lockert.<br> Mrs. Dodsworth.<br> - Captain Lockert.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Shall we have a drink at the table?<br> - Serve them over here, please.<br> - All right, sir.<br> You see, darling, we didn't have<br> to dress for dinner the first night out.<br> Of course, we can't be expected to know<br> all the tricks the first trip over.<br> It's not my first trip over,<br> Sammy dear.<br> That's right. Mrs. Dodsworth went<br> to school in Switzerland one summer.<br> I can't see it's ever bad form<br> to dress for dinner.<br> I'm sure that anything<br> that permits a woman...<br> to look as lovely as Mrs. Dodsworth<br> is looking could never be bad form.<br> - Very good.<br> - This is just a simple dinner frock.<br> - Will you have this?<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Another martini, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - New York, and now I'm back to London.<br> - Really?<br> - How long will you be in England?<br> - We haven't made plans beyond London.<br> There aren't too many Americans...<br> Look at those two women.<br> Can't you just see them in Venice<br> with their Baedekers?<br> Why is it that traveling Americans<br> are always so dreadful?<br> Why is it Americans<br> are always such snobs?<br> You think it's snobbish to want to see<br> someone besides fellow citizens aboard?<br> You can't think of what one misses by<br> leading a safe and sane American life.<br> Will you put me in charge<br> of your safety and sanity?<br> And tonight between 11:15 and 11:30,<br> Mr. Dodsworth...<br> you will see<br> this light off the port bow.<br> - Bishop's Light, it's called.<br> - Bishop's Light?<br> Yes, on Bishop's Rock.<br> - You sorry it's over?<br> - What's over?<br> - The voyage.<br> - Oh, no.<br> Not that I've been bored though.<br> You've taken excellent care of that.<br> I'm making great plans<br> for us in London.<br> For us? I know these steamship<br> intimacies. They never survive dry land.<br> Why can't you believe that this,<br> as they say, is different?<br> - What?<br> - It was land.<br> - Was it, Sammy dear?<br> - Bishop's Light, they call it.<br> I could get ashore in an hour<br> if I had a motorboat.<br> I can't believe we've done it!<br> Ashore! In England!<br> I don't know what to do<br> about Sam's Anglomania.<br> That's all right about my Anglomania,<br> but come look at the light with me.<br> All right. Come on.<br> Let's look at the light.<br> Now don't hurry me, Sam.<br> I've got on high heels.<br> My hair will be ruined in this wind!<br> I'm freezing! I haven't got any coat!<br> - Put this on.<br> - Please.<br> What difference does it make?<br> - I don't see any light.<br> - Wait. You'll see it in a minute.<br> - Where will I look?<br> - Look straight over there.<br> - I can't see it.<br> - Wait. There it goes!<br> See it?<br> That's very pretty,<br> but you can have your coat now.<br> Captain Lockert and I<br> have to dance.<br> - It'll flash again in a minute.<br> - I just can't stay. It's too cold.<br> - There it goes again!<br> - I'd like to stay and watch...<br> - Coming, Lockert?<br> - Yes, coming.<br> Say, Fran, I could get ashore in<br> half an hour if I had a fast motorboat!<br> - I beg pardon, sir.<br> - Oh, yeah, sure. That's right.<br> Oh, well, sir,<br> last night of the voyage.<br> - Yes, sir, half an hour, maybe less.<br> - Beg pardon, sir.<br> - Bring me a drink out here, will you?<br> - What would you like?<br> Bring me something<br> quieting to the nerves.<br> - Quieting, sir?<br> - Yeah...<br> - Why don't you try stout, Mr. Dodsworth?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> You asked for something quieting,<br> and I prescribed stout.<br> - A double stout, sir?<br> - All right, sure. Yeah.<br> What is it you called that light?<br> I saw it too.<br> Bishop's Light. Of course, I've never<br> been across before. I got excited.<br> I took one look at that light and<br> all I read about England came to light.<br> The town behind it with<br> those flat-faced brick houses...<br> and a cart crawling up a hill<br> between high hedges...<br> and Jane Austen,<br> Oliver Twist and Sherlock Holmes.<br> England. Mother England.<br> - Home.<br> - Have you always felt that way?<br> I don't know. It just now struck me,<br> but I guess I must have.<br> Most Americans would<br> if it weren't taught out of them.<br> - All my people came from England.<br> - Sit down, Mr. Dodsworth.<br> You do need soothing.<br> I've been having such a good time<br> on this trip. Everybody's so nice.<br> There's nothing<br> like a first trip to Europe.<br> Especially when you're old enough<br> to know what you're after.<br> "What you're after."<br> What are you after?<br> My wife, of course,<br> she's been over before.<br> She wants me to learn how to<br> enjoy my leisure, now I've retired.<br> But what it boils down to... I've been<br> doing things myself for a long time.<br> I thought I'd give things a chance<br> to do something to me.<br> - The education of an American.<br> - Yes, you might call it that.<br> - How long have you given yourself?<br> - Six months.<br> - To get all that done?<br> - I'll be homesick by then.<br> I was homesick the first year<br> I came over.<br> - Came over? Where from?<br> - Michigan.<br> - American, huh?<br> - I don't know what I am.<br> I used to be a British subject<br> by marriage.<br> I don't know that one can be<br> a British subject by divorce.<br> I expect I'm just a woman<br> who lives in Italy.<br> - Do people live in Italy?<br> - There are countless Italians.<br> I mean, people like you.<br> I live in Italy by the thousands.<br> - Why?<br> - It's cheap.<br> My wife tells me<br> I ask too many questions.<br> Dear Sam. Sometimes he has got<br> the most bourgeois ideas.<br> Bishop's Light. Look at my hair.<br> Can't do a thing with it.<br> Guess that'll have to do.<br> - Well, how do I look? All right?<br> - Superb.<br> - Shall we go?<br> - Look what I've got.<br> Can't we stay and<br> have our nightcap down here?<br> Why not?<br> We can't go off and leave everything as<br> perfect as this. That'd be ridiculous.<br> I'd like to stay right here<br> and see the dawn.<br> You don't think he'll roar around the<br> ship and shoot when he finds me here?<br> Who, Sam? Oh, no.<br> No, he's got all the old-fashioned<br> virtues, except jealousy.<br> You call that a virtue?<br> When a wife who isn't plain<br> seems to be attractive to men...<br> and doesn't mind<br> their showing they're attracted.<br> Yes, I think I see what you mean.<br> - Highball?<br> - Yes, thanks.<br> - Two highballs, please.<br> - Two scotch and sodas, sir?<br> Yeah, all right.<br> You got my name.<br> Would you mind telling me yours?<br> - Mrs. Cortright.<br> - Mrs. Cortright. Thanks.<br> We haven't spoken before.<br> You don't talk to many people on board.<br> My wife said you didn't<br> open up much when she tried you.<br> Perhaps I wasn't<br> feeling so well that day.<br> - Feeling better tonight?<br> - Much better. Thank you.<br> You've lived abroad.<br> What's it like?<br> That depends on what one's after,<br> as you would say.<br> When a man has no more job<br> and his wife wants a fling...<br> there are worse things than travel.<br> It wouldn't do for me though.<br> No, not long, it wouldn't.<br> For a steady thing, give me America.<br> For Americans, that is.<br> Drifting isn't nearly<br> so pleasant as it looks.<br> Why don't you give it up?<br> One drifts for lack of a reason<br> to do anything else.<br> Well, what do you want?<br> What do you suppose<br> any Ione woman wants?<br> Guess I've been<br> talking too much again.<br> Don't leave me and go trekking<br> all over the continent.<br> Stay in London.<br> I should miss you so terribly.<br> You don't mean that,<br> and I don't want you to mean it.<br> You're so wrong, Fran dear.<br> Some, I assure you,<br> have never been given a chance.<br> I shouldn't be human<br> if I didn't love hearing that.<br> Really. Really, Clyde,<br> that's a very silly thing to do.<br> I don't think I like it.<br> If you don't mind my saying,<br> I find you extraordinarily attractive.<br> Don't you think you and I, perhaps,<br> have been seeing too much of each other?<br> My dear Fran, dismiss that idea<br> from your mind at once...<br> and come and have lunch with me<br> in London tomorrow.<br> I most certainly shall not have luncheon<br> with you in London tomorrow...<br> and I shall say good night now.<br> Can't you think of anything more<br> cheerful to say than just good night?<br> Couldn't you say, "Good night, Clyde,"<br> or even, "Good night, Clyde dear"?<br> Good night is all<br> I'm inclined to say.<br> You're taking<br> a wickedly unfair advantage of me.<br> I only thought I was doing<br> what was expected of me.<br> - What I expected of you?<br> - Not you alone, Fran.<br> There's a tradition<br> about this sort of thing.<br> I thought civilized people knew<br> where an innocent flirtation stops.<br> For a civilized woman who's<br> been married as long as you have...<br> you're making a great deal<br> of a small matter.<br> It's not a small matter to me.<br> I offer you<br> my most abject apology.<br> If I might offer you<br> one small word of advice...<br> give up starting things<br> you're not prepared to finish.<br> It's quite evident they only<br> lead you out of your depth.<br> You think I'm not equal<br> to your impudence?<br> Look at the exhibition<br> you're making of yourself.<br> I?<br> Any modern schoolgirl<br> could compete with this situation.<br> You've got the most childish<br> misconception of yourself.<br> You think you're a woman of the world,<br> and you're nothing of the sort.<br> If I should send for the steward to have<br> you put out, my husband will hear of it.<br> He most certainly will.<br> I shall make an enormous noise.<br> Good night, Captain.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Well, this is a good connection.<br> - You're not going?<br> Yes, I've got to tuck in now.<br> - Nightcap before you go?<br> - No, thank you. I've got to pack.<br> - We'll be seeing you.<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> - Sure you won't have lunch tomorrow?<br> - Quite sure.<br> That's too bad. I think you would<br> have enjoyed that lunch. Well...<br> He's not so bad.<br> He's fresh, but he's not so bad.<br> Why, darling?<br> Why, darling, what is it?<br> What is it, darling, huh?<br> I've never been so furious<br> in my life.<br> - About Lockert?<br> - Don't speak that rotter's name.<br> - What did he do?<br> - He insulted me.<br> - How far did he go?<br> - He said things to me, Sam...<br> He said things...<br> I can't bear it.<br> Well, I suppose it's up to me<br> to go up and shoot him.<br> Don't joke!<br> I would feel like a fool. You and I<br> are not up to this sort of thing.<br> It kind of makes us<br> look like the hicks we are.<br> It does, and it's your own fault<br> for leading him on.<br> - I suppose I'm to blame.<br> - You must have given him some excuse.<br> You have been flirting with him.<br> You've got such a sweet way of bawling<br> me out in front of him, he'd conclude...<br> I never said a word to embarrass you<br> in all my life.<br> I've always been loyal to you.<br> You'll be sorry for this.<br> - Fran, I'm tired.<br> - Don't you think I'm tired too?<br> All right then, we're both tired.<br> There were some cigarettes<br> here somewhere.<br> Here they are.<br> - Sam?<br> - Yeah?<br> Don't let's go to England at all.<br> What? We're there now.<br> I want to go over to France<br> right away.<br> I'm so ashamed of this Lockert business.<br> I'm ashamed way deep down inside me.<br> What difference does that make?<br> I want to go to England. I've got<br> a date to look at automobile factories...<br> I can't stay in England with that man<br> laughing at me and saying...<br> What? That you kicked him out?<br> That's not what he'll say.<br> Silly.<br> Yeah?<br> You've got to take care of me.<br> You really have, Sam.<br> I don't trust myself.<br> I'm afraid of myself.<br> - You're afraid, sweetheart?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> I'm just a wooly American<br> like you after all.<br> If you ever catch me trying<br> to be anything else, will you beat me?<br> Well, will I have<br> to beat you very long at a time?<br> Oh, Sam, come in<br> and finish your breakfast.<br> You know, Fran, when you think of it,<br> that's a thrill, a real thrill.<br> Down there where the obelisk stands,<br> that's where the guillotine used to be.<br> That's where that what's-her-name?<br> That Madam Roland said...<br> "O Liberty, what crimes<br> are committed in thy name!"<br> Only in French.<br> That's where Madam...<br> Marie Antoinette had her head cut off.<br> Sammy darling, I've said good morning<br> to the obelisk for the last time.<br> From now on, I'm just gonna pretend<br> it isn't there at all.<br> Okay. Well, what are<br> your plans for today?<br> My plans? I don't know.<br> What are yours?<br> - I'm going to look at Napoleon's tomb.<br> - You'll love that, I'm sure.<br> - Come with me?<br> - This morning?<br> I'm afraid I can't. I have a fitting<br> at 11:00 and the hairdresser's at 11:30.<br> Rene de Penable is fetching me.<br> Oh, see who that is, will you?<br> Hello?<br> Okay, send her up.<br> - Who's that?<br> - It's Madame de Penable.<br> Oh, I must hurry. Sammy, put on<br> your coat. This is much too domestic.<br> And put the cover<br> on the ham and the eggs.<br> I simply cannot understand how anyone<br> can eat the breakfast you do.<br> Here in France, they've learned<br> the wisdom of beginning the day fasting.<br> In the few weeks I've been here,<br> I've learned it myself.<br> But you still eat the breakfast<br> you do at home.<br> - I still got the same insides.<br> - Yes, I'm afraid you have.<br> - Is that my Petite Parisienne?<br> - No, that's my Paris Herald.<br> What good does<br> your patootie do me?<br> - Oh, meet me for lunch?<br> - No, I can't.<br> Rene's giving it to me at the Ritz.<br> Well, how about meeting me<br> at the Caf de la Paix at 4:00?<br> Well, Sammy, I'll try.<br> - All right. Bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> Good morning. The first on the list<br> today is Napoleon's tomb.<br> - How's the French coming?<br> - Fine!<br> Yesterday I said<br> to a taxi driver...<br> And he understood me.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> My guidebook.<br> You just don't know Sam.<br> He's really very sweet.<br> There he comes now.<br> - Arnold!<br> - Rene, so glad to see you.<br> And this, Mrs. Dodsworth,<br> is Mr. Arnold Iselin.<br> How do you do?<br> What brings you back<br> from Dublin so soon?<br> - I hope it wasn't business.<br> - No, nothing so vulgar as business.<br> - Who is that?<br> - That is the Comtesse De La Villalonga.<br> - Tea?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> I really think I ought to go<br> and speak with her.<br> May I leave you in Mr. Iselin's<br> most excellent care?<br> Rene has the most amusing friends,<br> doesn't she?<br> And the most charming.<br> How much?<br> - More tea?<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> You know, I never thought<br> I'd find Paris so exciting.<br> What can I do to find myself<br> a part of your Paris?<br> Come and dine with us tomorrow.<br> You free?<br> Of course.<br> I tell you, it was very interesting.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then I went inside and<br> looked at the tomb where he lies.<br> There we were, Napoleon<br> and Sam Dodsworth of Zenith together.<br> Excuse me, my dear Fran,<br> I really must be going.<br> Really?<br> Good night.<br> Sam, get Rene's wraps for her,<br> will you?<br> So sorry it's been so dull.<br> We'd much better have celebrated my<br> birthday as I wanted at some nightclub.<br> But Sam always persists in taking care<br> that I don't get tired.<br> Tired.<br> Here we are.<br> I hadn't realized<br> it was your birthday.<br> No? Wish I hadn't.<br> No woman enjoys getting to be 35.<br> When you're my age, you look back<br> on 35 as a most agreeable time of life.<br> I hope I look as young as you do<br> when I'm your age.<br> You're almost sure to, my dear.<br> I must get my coat too.<br> I left my coat<br> in the garde-robe below.<br> Good night, Baron. Thank you so much<br> for your sweet flowers.<br> Phone me up tomorrow.<br> Perhaps we can dine somewhere for tea.<br> I'd love to.<br> Sam, will you put<br> Rene and the baron in the lift?<br> Sure, be glad to.<br> - Well, I'm glad you did.<br> - Have you been to the opera?<br> Smoke another cigarette.<br> It has been very charming.<br> Then come and dine with us again.<br> You and your husband<br> must come to me next.<br> Are you free Tuesday?<br> Shall we say 8:00?<br> Quai Voltaire,<br> straight over the river.<br> What a charming address.<br> We shall look forward to it.<br> Nerves, dear lady, nerves.<br> I'm poor in so many ways.<br> So many.<br> - Thank you so much, Mrs. Dodsworth.<br> - I suppose we won't be seeing you again.<br> I'm really off to Italy<br> in the morning.<br> My dear, don't.<br> What?<br> You're so charming.<br> Well, you're not going?<br> Yes, I stole a bit of your letter paper<br> to write my address in Italy on it.<br> - It's near Naples.<br> - We'll use it when we're your way.<br> - Please do.<br> - Good night. Bon voyage.<br> Thank you. Good night.<br> - I must be going too.<br> - Good night.<br> You were saying something<br> about the first Benz car.<br> Another night. That will keep.<br> Good night.<br> Good night, sir.<br> You like that woman, don't you?<br> You thought she was the most<br> distinguished-Iooking woman on the boat.<br> Seems a frump in Paris.<br> Unfasten me, will you?<br> I'm always glad to see your friends,<br> even the not particularly amusing ones.<br> Don't you think we've<br> had about enough of Paris?<br> In a month? My dear Sam.<br> Don't you think it's about time<br> we're beating it back home?<br> Home? No, I should think not.<br> I want to see lots more of Europe.<br> So do I, but we could get in a couple<br> of months in the Mediterranean...<br> and Germany and still<br> catch an August sailing.<br> I want to see Venice and Rome.<br> Still planning your sightseeing tours,<br> Sammy dear?<br> I don't see much percentage<br> in sitting here on my...<br> Bring me my cold cream, will you,<br> Sammy? It's in the bathroom.<br> We got to begin<br> making plans pretty soon.<br> Why don't you go home?<br> - Without you?<br> - Yeah.<br> Get yourself a new lease on life<br> and come back here and join me.<br> Why don't ya?<br> I wouldn't want<br> to go home without you.<br> I can see you're not<br> enjoying yourself in Paris.<br> I'm only thinking<br> of your pleasure.<br> If you've got a mind, you wouldn't ask<br> me to leave. I just made nice friends.<br> I don't think they're so nice.<br> I don't, and I don't see<br> what you see in them.<br> This Arnold Iselin may be all he says<br> he is internationally and financially...<br> but he certainly<br> is no Barney Baruch.<br> That Mrs. De Penable,<br> I suppose she's all right...<br> if you don't mind your friend collecting<br> commission on the dresses you buy.<br> I hate to think who pays the bill<br> when that young Austrian takes you out.<br> Arnold Iselin happens to be one<br> of the most famous living financiers...<br> and a distinguished art collector.<br> And Rene... By the way, she's<br> Madame de Penable, not Mrs. Penable.<br> Rene is the true woman<br> of this great world here.<br> The baron may be poor, but he holds<br> one of the oldest titles in Austria.<br> They all belong<br> to the smartest crowd in Paris.<br> You think the real thing in Paris would<br> hang out with a couple of hicks like us?<br> What else are we?<br> I'm just an ordinary<br> American businessman...<br> and I married the daughter of a Zenith<br> brewer who's flying high these days.<br> I suppose you know<br> what you mean by that.<br> - Why won't you sit at a cafe with me?<br> - Smart people don't.<br> - I'm not smart.<br> - I am.<br> You ought to be smart enough<br> not to care what people think.<br> It's self-respect, like the Englishman<br> dressing for dinner in the jungle.<br> I read about him.<br> He probably never did it.<br> - You simply will not understand.<br> - I can't!<br> If I want men to be<br> something more than waiters!<br> - I've heard my friends insulted enough!<br> - A lot of moochers.<br> Let's hear about the great motor magnate<br> and what he did for the auto industry.<br> You may be the most impressive man<br> in Zenith, but you're not in Zenith now.<br> You're in Paris now, and<br> I'm sick of apologizing to my friends...<br> - How you been apologizing for me?<br> - Yes, I have!<br> Hello? Yes?<br> All right.<br> We've been making so much noise<br> someone's complained.<br> - How humiliating.<br> - Yes, isn't it?<br> All right, go ahead.<br> Pipe down, but go ahead. I'm waiting.<br> You're hopeless. You haven't the<br> mistiest notion of civilization here.<br> Maybe I don't think<br> so much of it though.<br> Maybe clean hospitals,<br> concrete highways...<br> and no soldiers on the Canadian border<br> come nearer my idea of civilization.<br> There are 20 million automobiles<br> in America.<br> I've contributed something to every one<br> of them from my own civilization.<br> If that isn't more than knowing how to<br> order dinner as your friend the madam...<br> - Don't call her "the madam" either.<br> - All right.<br> - Don't let's go into that again.<br> - You don't want to learn.<br> I could teach you.<br> I belong here.<br> - They accept me here.<br> - Yeah?<br> I'm gonna get out of this town and back<br> to doing something and take you along.<br> - I'm not going.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> No, I'm not. I think you and I<br> need a vacation from each other.<br> I don't feel that way about it. I think<br> I've been weak with you long enough.<br> Besides...<br> I've rented a villa with Rene<br> for the summer...<br> at Montreux<br> on Lake Geneva in Switzerland.<br> I've signed the lease.<br> Well, I think<br> you might have told me.<br> I got my own money.<br> - Fran!<br> - What?<br> Fran, my darling,<br> you're not drifting away from me.<br> - I hope not.<br> - Oh, no.<br> You and I, Fran,<br> after all these years.<br> All right, I'll give it up.<br> I won't go home.<br> But you've got to go.<br> You've simply got to.<br> I can't stand being<br> torn like this any longer.<br> I'm sorry for all the mean things<br> I've said to you.<br> But if we are going to go on together,<br> you've got to let me alone this summer.<br> Don't look so hurt, and please don't<br> be angry. Oh, be as angry as you like.<br> Remember, I did make a home<br> for you once, and I'll do it again...<br> only you've got to<br> let me have my fling now...<br> because you're simply<br> rushing at old age, Sam.<br> I'm not ready for that yet.<br> What is it, Sam?<br> I just thought I'd see<br> the first boat I could catch.<br> - I'm so glad you're back.<br> - I'm glad to see you.<br> - Let me look at you. You look all right.<br> - I'm fine.<br> How's Harry?<br> Is he treating you all right?<br> He better treat you all right.<br> Where is he?<br> He's at the office. Got a big deal on.<br> Couldn't get away.<br> He told me to tell you<br> he'd see you tonight though.<br> Big deal, eh?<br> - How's Mother?<br> - She's all right.<br> Why didn't she come home with you?<br> She's got some things<br> she wants to attend to.<br> Why did you come home without her?<br> Well, she...<br> What are you so nosy about?<br> - How's the new house coming along?<br> - Oh, it's wonderful.<br> - Do you want to drive out and see it?<br> - No, I want to go home.<br> I'll see it tomorrow. How about<br> a little check to help furnish it, huh?<br> No, thanks, darling.<br> Just because I've stopped working that<br> doesn't mean I've stopped being helpful.<br> We don't need your help.<br> We're getting along fine now.<br> Yeah?<br> Well...<br> could you use this?<br> Could I? Oh, it's beautiful.<br> And here.<br> Two of them.<br> - Faster. Can't you make it go faster?<br> - All right. Hold on!<br> All right.<br> - Fast enough?<br> - Yeah.<br> Kurt, why don't you<br> go in and play for us?<br> - Shall we make music, Rene?<br> - If you like.<br> - You coming inside?<br> - Inside?<br> Oh, no.<br> Let's stay out here, Arnold.<br> The music will sound<br> so lovely out here.<br> The afternoon post came<br> while you were gone.<br> Perhaps you may amuse Arnold<br> by reading your husband's letter to him.<br> Would you do something for me?<br> Within reason, why not?<br> Read your husband's letter.<br> That's an odd request, Arnold.<br> Anything within reason, you said.<br> I have my reasons.<br> Why did you make me<br> read this letter?<br> I've been having such fun today.<br> This letter's spoiled everything.<br> Switzerland,<br> the lake, the house.<br> All of it's just<br> so much Zenith now.<br> Presently he'll be<br> taking you back to Zenith.<br> What are you doing,<br> trying to torture me?<br> I'm making love to you.<br> What do you expect me<br> to say to that?<br> Don't make love to me, Arnold.<br> Afraid, Fran?<br> Surely not afraid.<br> If your husband had saved for you some<br> of the love he lavished on carburetors...<br> My dear innocent Fran.<br> I'm not innocent,<br> and Sam does love me.<br> No matter what he lacks,<br> I've always been able to trust him.<br> I live in the present.<br> Why don't you?<br> This letter is the past.<br> It's a future too,<br> at least it is for me.<br> Let's get rid of<br> both past and future.<br> How?<br> Would this be of any use to you?<br> What?<br> Why should I say<br> anything I didn't think?<br> - You didn't think what I thought?<br> - Maybe I don't care what you think!<br> - You ought to care what I think!<br> - I didn't know you could think!<br> - Dad!<br> - Is that so?<br> - Did you have a good time?<br> - Had a wonderful time!<br> Simply terrible!<br> What is this, the heat wave<br> or just a hangover?<br> - It's Sam!<br> - Sam! Yeah, sure!<br> Griping, just griping,<br> always griping.<br> - I'm going home!<br> - Go ahead!<br> - Sit down.<br> - I'm goin' home.<br> - Did a cable come for me today?<br> - No, Father.<br> There should have been a cable<br> from your mother.<br> I'll have Mary telephone.<br> - Don't trouble.<br> - It's no trouble.<br> If a cable had come, they'd<br> have sent it out, wouldn't they?<br> - Don't be cross.<br> - I'm not cross just because I asked.<br> In the old days, I wouldn't have to ask.<br> Been laid out on my desk for me.<br> The way things are run around this house<br> I can't find anything of mine.<br> - Please don't be difficult.<br> - Why shouldn't I be difficult?<br> When a man's made to feel more homeless<br> in his own house than he did in Paris!<br> - Now, Sam.<br> - It's true.<br> Only I'm not being difficult.<br> - Where's my mail?<br> - There isn't any.<br> - No mail?<br> - Not since the last I sent you.<br> My mail should be<br> laid out on that desk.<br> Your mother always had my mail<br> laid out on that desk.<br> - No mail, no cable.<br> - Is that the trouble?<br> - What?<br> - No mail, no cable?<br> And my whiskey should be<br> laid out on that table too.<br> Your mother always had it there waiting<br> for me. Whiskey and soda and ice.<br> I remember.<br> If you remember, why hasn't it been set<br> out once since I came home from Europe?<br> - You haven't spoken of it before.<br> - Don't think I haven't missed it.<br> Mary, will you please bring<br> my father's whiskey and soda?<br> I'm sorry, ma'am,<br> but the wine closet's locked.<br> - Well, unlock it.<br> - Harry's got the key on his watch chain.<br> What's the key to my liquor<br> doing on my son-in-law's watch chain?<br> You gave Harry that key,<br> and he's taking very good care of it.<br> You're taking his side<br> against me, are ya?<br> - It doesn't matter, Sam...<br> - Excuse me, Matey, but it does matter.<br> If a man can't invite a friend of his<br> to have a drink in his own library...<br> Never said anything<br> about a drink to me!<br> - I was just going to.<br> - That's all, Mary. Thank you.<br> - If I can't give you a drink...<br> - But you can in a minute, Father.<br> Harry will be home any minute. I know<br> because we're going to a cocktail party.<br> - Will you have a cigar?<br> - Anything, Sam. Anything.<br> - Where are the cigars?<br> - Harry smokes cigarettes.<br> - I'll have Mary telephone him...<br> - Wait a minute!<br> Where's the humidor<br> that used to be on this table?<br> - It isn't there now.<br> - It stood there for years!<br> - Mary, where's Father's humidor?<br> - I'm sorry, ma'am...<br> It stood right there! It was round<br> and copper-like on the outside.<br> Oh, that. Mrs. McKee<br> took it to plant bulbs in.<br> - Plant bulbs in my humidor, eh?<br> - Just a few hyacinths.<br> - What's this truck here?<br> - That's a jigsaw puzzle.<br> - Get it out of here.<br> - You can't move it...<br> A man's got to have one room in his<br> own house that he can feel at home in!<br> Get this thing out of here now!<br> I don't want it in here.<br> You be careful, Sam.<br> Be careful. Let me do that.<br> - Don't drop it. Give it to me.<br> - What foolishness is it anyway?<br> - What's it supposed to be?<br> - It was going to be the Chicago Fire.<br> - Chicago Fire?<br> - They got the title almost put together.<br> - What's a cow doing in the Chicago Fire?<br> - It started by a cow kicking a lantern.<br> That isn't the way<br> the Chicago Fire started.<br> Yes, it was. It was an earthquake<br> in 'Frisco and a cow in Chicago.<br> - My father was in Chicago in '71!<br> - That was after the fire.<br> - That's the year of the fire!<br> - The fire was in the '60s.<br> - That was the Civil War!<br> - They were both in the '60s!<br> I'll bet you!<br> Where's my encyclopedia?<br> - Here. Take the truck.<br> - What'll I do with it?<br> Take it out of here. It never would<br> have been in here in your mother's day.<br> Your mother had some respect<br> for a man's library.<br> No mail, no cable, no cigars.<br> Hello, everybody.<br> How about a drink?<br> Father, I'm sorry things<br> aren't the way they used to be.<br> But Harry and I<br> are living in this house too.<br> I wish you'd stop speaking of Mother<br> as though she were dead.<br> I'm not speaking of your mother<br> as though she...<br> Yes, you are.<br> - Well, your mother's coming home.<br> - When's she coming?<br> I sent a cable for her to come. I'm<br> expecting a cable telling me what boat.<br> When Mother didn't come home with you<br> and you looked so worried...<br> I was afraid there might be<br> some kind of trouble between you.<br> Between your mother and me?<br> Not a chance.<br> - It was silly.<br> - Certainly was.<br> I forgot. I've got a cable.<br> It was sent in my care...<br> so it came to the office somehow.<br> "Ladies first"<br> as they say in a shipwreck.<br> What's the matter?<br> Isn't Mother coming?<br> This is nothing.<br> This isn't from your mother.<br> I thought you were going<br> to a cocktail party.<br> - We were...<br> - Go on and go.<br> - We don't have to...<br> - Go on and go.<br> Ya big stiff.<br> You old horse thief.<br> Sam, you old darling.<br> - She's not coming.<br> - I guessed as much.<br> It's Ionesome here without her.<br> What does she say?<br> "Want few more months Europe.<br> Hope you're having good time home."<br> I cable her to come and she doesn't<br> say one word about me going over.<br> - She's thoughtless.<br> - No, she's not, Matey. She's scared.<br> Fran scared? What of?<br> Of growing old.<br> That's very smart of you, Sam.<br> Yeah.<br> - Will you read her last letter?<br> - Fran's letter to you?<br> Yes, it's not so private.<br> - What's this?<br> - The way they make sevens in France.<br> Sounds like a beautiful place.<br> - Have you seen it?<br> - No.<br> - What?<br> - She said they're having a good time.<br> Well, it sounds<br> like a healthy time.<br> - You know these people?<br> - Yes.<br> - You like them?<br> - Well, they're all right.<br> They're very clever people.<br> They're not my style.<br> I see.<br> - Well?<br> - Nothing.<br> You're an old friend, Matey.<br> I don't know what to think.<br> Who's Arnold Iselin?<br> He's one of those<br> custom-built internationals...<br> you see in the rotogravure section<br> every Sunday.<br> - Well, give us a kiss now.<br> - Matey, I thought you wanted to...<br> Will you lay off those<br> European liberties with my wife?<br> Come along. Come on.<br> Western Union, please.<br> Hello. Take a cable<br> going to Mrs. Dodsworth.<br> This is Samuel Dodsworth speaking.<br> Same address as my last.<br> Ready?<br> "Sailing Aquitania Wednesday.<br> Stop.<br> Meet me Cron Paris. Love.<br> Signed, Sam."<br> And take another,<br> going to A.B. Hurd... H-U-R-D...<br> Manager, Dodsworth Car, Paris.<br> "Sailing Aquitania Wednesday.<br> Stop.<br> Using utmost discretion ascertain...<br> day-to-day address<br> of Arnold Iselin...<br> l-S-E-L-l-N...<br> Paris. Stop.<br> Keep me informed wireless.<br> Signed, Dodsworth."<br> Another wireless, Mr. Dodsworth.<br> "To Samuel Dodsworth, Aquitania,<br> Iselin At Present Biarritz. Hurd."<br> Will you sign, sir?<br> - Where is Biarritz?<br> - Biarritz is in France, sir.<br> Down by the Spanish border.<br> It's a fashionable watering place.<br> - Yes, thank you.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Oh, darling!<br> - You look fine.<br> - You don't look bad yourself.<br> - When'd you get to Paris?<br> - Before dinner.<br> - You must be tired.<br> - I'm not tired.<br> How far is it from Montreux?<br> I came much further than that.<br> I came all the way from Biarritz.<br> What's the matter?<br> Nothing.<br> How are Emily and Matey and Tubby?<br> Tell me all the news.<br> Everybody's fine.<br> You might go a little more into detail.<br> After all, Emily's my daughter too.<br> Emily's very happy.<br> That marriage is working out all right.<br> I'm so glad. Of course, I never<br> thought Harry was very exciting.<br> Weren't you pretty Ionely<br> in Biarritz?<br> I wasn't sorry to be by myself<br> for a bit.<br> Why do you keep looking<br> at your watch all the time?<br> - I've never seen you like this before.<br> - No?<br> I've never seen you<br> like this either, Fran.<br> What'd you do to your hair?<br> Oh, just touched it up a bit.<br> Like it?<br> This looks natural.<br> Well, it was as cool as anything<br> they had, so I took it again.<br> Yeah? Well, all hotel rooms<br> look alike to me.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Where are you going?<br> He's just going to put the bags<br> in the other room.<br> What room?<br> I thought you'd be tired<br> after your long trip.<br> The weather being so stifling,<br> I took the two bedrooms this time.<br> You don't mind the separate rooms,<br> do you, Sam?<br> I don't mind anything<br> now that I'm back with you again.<br> Let's don't stay here. Let's go out and<br> find some cool spot and have a drink.<br> - I thought you were tired.<br> - No, I'm not tired.<br> There you go, looking at your watch<br> again. Really. It's not very polite.<br> If my company hangs<br> so heavily on your hands...<br> why did you make me leave Biarritz<br> and come all this way?<br> - I'm expecting a visitor.<br> - At this time of night?<br> At Cherbourg, I telegraphed a man to<br> meet me here. I'll give him 10 minutes...<br> Here we are.<br> Hello? Yes, I'm expecting him.<br> Send him up, please.<br> - I'll wait in the bedroom.<br> - No, you stay.<br> But your business acquaintances don't<br> amuse me too terribly, you know, Sam.<br> This is not<br> a business acquaintance.<br> - Someone I know?<br> - Yes.<br> - Someone from Zenith?<br> - You'll see who it is.<br> Has Rene de Penable been gossiping?<br> If she has, it's a pack of lies.<br> I haven't heard a word<br> from Mrs. Penable.<br> What are you up to?<br> Steady, darling. Sit down.<br> Come in.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> Was it Arnold you telegraphed to?<br> I think you might have told me.<br> It wasn't my idea to tell you.<br> I tried to reach you over the telephone<br> to tell you that I was coming.<br> I wanted to see you two face-to-face.<br> Fran alone would've wasted time acting.<br> I knew you'd been in Biarritz together.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I hate undercover work myself.<br> I wouldn't have got where I have<br> if it hadn't been in me to be ruthless.<br> It's the most outrageous thing<br> I've ever heard in my life.<br> - What if Arnold was in Biarritz?<br> - Won't you let me handle my part?<br> Let me remind you that Shakespeare's<br> Othello ends badly for the hero.<br> I'm not Othello.<br> This is not the Middle Ages.<br> None of us speak blank verse,<br> not even you.<br> You are rather<br> jumping at conclusions, you know.<br> Have you ever noticed how transparent<br> people are when you really look at them?<br> What are you implying?<br> Do you know how insulting you are?<br> You don't know how insulting I'm going<br> to be if you don't stop playacting.<br> I'm sure you've given her things she<br> needed and wanted and never got from me.<br> I'm interested in what I need and want<br> and that happens to be peace of mind.<br> If you can bring yourself<br> to see matters reasonably...<br> I've crossed the Atlantic Ocean<br> to be reasonable.<br> I've loved you and been<br> married to you for 20 years.<br> I want to hold on to you if I can.<br> You want to marry each other?<br> I won't let you throw me<br> at Arnold's head.<br> You want to divorce me then?<br> Why should I want to divorce you?<br> You're my husband.<br> You couldn't very well divorce me<br> if I weren't.<br> - You can laugh.<br> - Yes, I can do worse than that.<br> I'm finding all this<br> very distasteful.<br> - It's ridiculous.<br> - Certainly it's ridiculous.<br> The old triangle stuff.<br> I knew we'd all end<br> by looking like fools.<br> - I go now if you'll excuse me.<br> - Sure, I'll excuse you.<br> You have nothing more<br> to say to him, have you?<br> I hope you achieve<br> your peace of mind, Mr. Dodsworth.<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> I'm so sorry, Sam.<br> I'm so terribly sorry.<br> Well, I'm ready to wipe<br> the slate clean if you are...<br> and start out<br> on a long hike tomorrow.<br> Anything you say, Sam.<br> Anything you say.<br> Italy, anyplace...<br> till we sail back home<br> in December.<br> Home in December.<br> Zenith in December.<br> You'll want to go home<br> in December.<br> Emily's having a baby<br> in December.<br> - A baby?<br> - Yes.<br> - She didn't tell me.<br> - She left me the fun of telling you.<br> - Is she well?<br> - Yes, she's fine.<br> I must send her a cable.<br> No, I could telephone her, couldn't I?<br> What time is it in Zenith?<br> We'll have to learn<br> to behave ourselves...<br> when we'll be a couple<br> of old grandparents in December.<br> Here you are, young one.<br> It's your mama and daddy.<br> Gee.<br> Where's that telegram?<br> Over there.<br> Listen to this, young fella.<br> "Mr. Samuel Dodsworth McKee."<br> That's you.<br> Are you listening?<br> "Congratulations on your arrival.<br> Stop.<br> We send all our love and affection.<br> Grandpa and Grandma Dodsworth."<br> See? Look at it.<br> Just think, Mr. McKee...<br> all the way from Vienna.<br> I do love Vienna. Don't you?<br> I love you, Fran.<br> Oh, Sam darling.<br> I'm so silly and heedless, and I don't<br> speak of it as often as I should...<br> but I'm terribly grateful inside.<br> I want you back for my wife.<br> Shall I tell you how?<br> By understanding,<br> by staying on here in Europe...<br> by helping me forget<br> Arnold Iselin.<br> By forgetting him yourself.<br> - Haven't you anything to say?<br> - What is there to say?<br> After having opened<br> my heart to you...<br> it makes me a little self-conscious<br> to see you there not saying anything.<br> "Self-conscious"?<br> Maybe that's my trouble.<br> Maybe that's the trouble<br> with all reconciled couples afterwards.<br> That's not very generous of you.<br> I've lost my bearings.<br> I don't know where I'm heading.<br> - Who are you calling?<br> - I thought I'd like to talk to Emily.<br> We sent her a cable already.<br> I'd like to hear her voice and see<br> how the baby got through his first day.<br> There's not time. Those transatlantic<br> calls are slow from here.<br> And Kurt'll be coming in.<br> Kurt can wait.<br> I won't have Kurt standing around<br> while you and I gush to Emily.<br> I know how thrilled you are<br> about the baby, and so am I...<br> but all our friends here<br> think of me as young, and I am.<br> I was such a child when you married me.<br> It isn't fair.<br> Come in.<br> Good evening.<br> I brought you a box<br> of real Havana cigars.<br> - Very kind of you.<br> - Smuggled through without duty.<br> Tonight I take you to a very gay<br> restaurant with very good food.<br> - And dance after?<br> - If you make Sam get dressed.<br> I think I'll let you go<br> without me.<br> No, you must come with us!<br> What fun do you think it is for me<br> to sit all night watching you two dance?<br> Do not speak so crossly.<br> You should be happy to see Fran happy.<br> She is so lovely when she's happy.<br> I'm sorry I snapped.<br> I'd only spoil your fun.<br> I got important news from home today.<br> Yes? News?<br> Nothing that would interest you.<br> Bad news?<br> No, not bad.<br> I think I'll sit here by myself<br> and think things over.<br> Perhaps Sam would rather be<br> left alone tonight...<br> but I want to go out.<br> - Have you been quarreling, you two?<br> - No.<br> You must not.<br> You're here so small a time.<br> Perhaps I shall never see you again.<br> Let's not be serious.<br> Come with us. Life is so short.<br> Life will be a lot shorter for me<br> if I don't get some sleep.<br> You run along and have your fun.<br> Thank you, Sam dear,<br> for so many things.<br> Come on, Kurt.<br> I'm sorry, Sam.<br> Good night.<br> Oh, I simply adore it.<br> I think you were meant to dance<br> all your life long.<br> You couldn't suggest anything<br> I'd like any better.<br> Thanks.<br> Good night.<br> Fun and friends all evening.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Don't stand there in the doorway.<br> Come on in.<br> I do not like<br> coming in here so late.<br> I do not think Sam would like it.<br> Have we even sent him<br> any reason to mind?<br> No.<br> Don't be a stinker.<br> Sam's dead to the world.<br> Just don't talk loud, that's all.<br> Sit down.<br> Give me my purse.<br> Thank you.<br> Darling...<br> You know I love you, Fran.<br> You know that.<br> You must stop that kind of talk.<br> Is it so wicked?<br> Have you not been happy<br> with me in Vienna?<br> I've been terribly happy.<br> You know that.<br> I think you could love me.<br> I think you could.<br> There's nothing we can do<br> about it, is there?<br> No, that's true.<br> My hands are tied.<br> You're married to Sam, my friend.<br> I can't ask you to be my wife.<br> You want to marry me?<br> Does it surprise you?<br> Why are you not free?<br> If I were free...<br> - Fran, if you were free...<br> - Don't. Please don't.<br> Forgive me.<br> You better go now.<br> I didn't know you'd come in.<br> I'm sorry I woke you up.<br> It's pretty late, not that I mind<br> you and Kurt staying out late.<br> What did you want?<br> Have things got this bad?<br> I'm too tired to talk tonight.<br> If things have got this bad,<br> they've got to stop altogether.<br> I'm willing to do anything to make<br> you happy. I love you. You know that.<br> But if we're going on together,<br> as you said in Paris...<br> I'm saying it now, we've got to beat it<br> right back home where we belong.<br> Is that your idea<br> of making me happy?<br> I'm not taking any more chances<br> on another Arnold Iselin.<br> I know this friendship with Kurt<br> is harmless enough...<br> but you might get fascinated.<br> You think I might?<br> You really think I might?<br> Well, I love Kurt, and Kurt loves me,<br> and I'm going to marry him.<br> He asked me tonight.<br> I decided it now when I found you here<br> hiding behind doors...<br> the Great Dodsworth,<br> great prowling elephant.<br> I wish Kurt had stayed<br> to punch your head for spying on us.<br> I wasn't spying.<br> You can't play<br> the injured innocent with me!<br> You've never known<br> anything about me...<br> not what I thought<br> or the sacrifices I've made.<br> - Look out!<br> - I'll be happy with Kurt.<br> I'm fighting for life!<br> You can't drag me back!<br> Will you get your divorce here?<br> Yes, I suppose so.<br> I wish you'd put it off<br> for a couple of months.<br> Why?<br> I'd like you to feel sure of Kurt.<br> Well, it's my funeral now, isn't it?<br> Yes, I guess so.<br> I'll have to get used to that idea.<br> I guess I can.<br> Oh, darling,<br> don't look so forlorn.<br> I know it's gonna be hard to realize,<br> but you and I can't get on together.<br> And I do love Kurt.<br> I stand by that.<br> All the same, you and I have had<br> some good times together.<br> I won't forget them.<br> You remember them?<br> Good-bye.<br> Do try not to be<br> too dreadfully Ionely, will you?<br> Did I remember to tell you today<br> that I adore you?<br> Anything for Dodsworth?<br> What's special delivery to Vienna?<br> All right?<br> I want to get<br> in the line of excursions.<br> - We have a touring party for Pompeii.<br> - I've been there.<br> There's a beautiful drive<br> around Mount Sorrento.<br> Been there too.<br> There's Capri and Brugherio.<br> I went there yesterday.<br> - How would you like Pastrum?<br> - What's Pastrum?<br> Greek temples, sir,<br> in excellent preservation.<br> That's more than I am.<br> I'll take a chance.<br> Get me a car.<br> - How many in the party?<br> - One.<br> Yes, sir. Name?<br> Do you remember me?<br> Mrs. Cortright! Of course.<br> - The steamer, Paris.<br> - And now Naples. Isn't this great?<br> - Where are you staying?<br> - At the Excelsior.<br> No, that was Rome last week.<br> It's the one by the aquarium.<br> I think it's the Grand.<br> It usually is.<br> Let's sit down,<br> if you've got a moment.<br> Time is something<br> I have nothing else but.<br> How's Mrs. Dodsworth?<br> I remember her with much pleasure.<br> She's fine.<br> I haven't got her along this trip.<br> - She doesn't like traveling?<br> - Does anyone?<br> I expect most people travel<br> to get away from themselves.<br> I've been at it three months now.<br> I'm glad to hear why.<br> - Alone?<br> - I'm getting used to it now.<br> All museums look alike.<br> All American Express offices<br> look alike.<br> You knew I live here.<br> You might've looked me up.<br> I've gotten out of the way<br> of looking folks up.<br> - The education, how's that coming along?<br> - I gave it up.<br> I found myself learning things<br> I didn't want to learn.<br> Pardon me, sir.<br> Your car is ready.<br> Hold it, will you?<br> You're busy...<br> I've got nothing to do<br> but look at ruined temples.<br> They'll keep.<br> They've kept this long.<br> Come out to meet for lunch.<br> - When?<br> - Anytime.<br> - Today?<br> - Yes. Why not?<br> Even if it weren't you,<br> if it were darn near anybody...<br> I'd be so glad to have<br> someone to talk to.<br> There's a couple at my hotel,<br> one of those really married couples.<br> They sit at the table<br> next to me every night.<br> They never say one word<br> to each other through dinner.<br> After dinner,<br> they sit in the lounge till 10:00.<br> Every night at 10:00, the husband says<br> to his wife, "Mary, it's getting late."<br> Just those four words.<br> Except for waiters and taxi drivers...<br> and they don't count...<br> that's four more words than I've said<br> any night in the past three weeks.<br> I don't want to intrude,<br> but I'm sorry.<br> I never wore these before.<br> Never needed them until lately.<br> I guess it's<br> a pretty ordinary story.<br> My wife's younger than I am,<br> and livelier.<br> I oughtn't to confess in public.<br> I never did that before either.<br> You haven't said anything<br> you shouldn't have said.<br> Will you go on traveling now?<br> Yes. I've got to stay over<br> and be on hand for the divorce.<br> - Where?<br> - Vienna.<br> Well, come along. We'll use<br> your car to help me do my marketing.<br> It'll do you a lot more good<br> than ruined temples.<br> There's no argument there.<br> What would you like for lunch?<br> Let's have some good American dish.<br> How about some clam chowder?<br> Clam chowder.<br> You get the clams.<br> I'll make the chowder.<br> All right.<br> No, no Pastrum.<br> The fish market.<br> Pietro!<br> Hello, boy!<br> - What's his name?<br> - Jinx.<br> Come on, Jinx!<br> What a wonderful spot.<br> Hello, Jinx.<br> Come on!<br> This is marvelous,<br> simply wonderful.<br> I can't believe it.<br> I simply can't believe it.<br> - Fifty dollars a month for this?<br> - That's all.<br> - Furnished?<br> - No. I picked up a few things.<br> - Are you hungry?<br> - Starved.<br> - I'll fix the clam chowder.<br> - She can do it...<br> Yes, dress me up in my camp clothes,<br> and I'm a first-class chef.<br> How would you like to hire me?<br> I'm a good cook, a fine mechanic<br> and a darn good fisherman.<br> Could you let yourself<br> enjoy life for a while?<br> Show me how.<br> I wonder if you could.<br> None of this that's happened to me<br> was my idea.<br> Break away from your hotel.<br> Forget about Vienna.<br> Move out here to me.<br> - Out to you?<br> - Yes.<br> I can't make you as comfortable<br> as your hotel does.<br> When you want a bath, you'll have<br> to choose between the tin tub...<br> and the Mediterranean.<br> If you like swimming, fishing,<br> a willing listener...<br> That's very kind of you<br> and mighty friendly, but...<br> I don't see how I could.<br> - Why not?<br> - What'd your neighbors think?<br> Being Italians,<br> they think a great deal.<br> Exactly.<br> That doesn't mean<br> it would have to be so...<br> or that I'd have it so<br> even if you wanted it so.<br> How do you do, Baroness?<br> How nice of you.<br> You must speak English, Mother.<br> Fran doesn't yet<br> understand German well.<br> We shall, of course, speak English.<br> But I'm working very hard<br> at my German, Baroness.<br> Do sit over here in this chair.<br> I think you'll find it more comfortable.<br> Kurt darling,<br> will you light a fire?<br> It's a very cold morning, isn't it?<br> There is no need to light a fire<br> for me, Kurt.<br> I am not cold.<br> Do let me give you a cup of coffee.<br> I have coffee.<br> You see? Kurt has taught me<br> that much Viennese.<br> No, thank you.<br> No coffee?<br> Well, then, I won't either.<br> Kurt, do sit down.<br> You look so strained.<br> Really, it's I who should feel strained,<br> and I don't feel that way.<br> I love your mother,<br> and I hope she's going to love me.<br> My mother believes<br> we should postpone our marriage.<br> No, Kurt, I did not say "postpone."<br> I came from the country<br> only this morning.<br> We had not much time for speaking,<br> Kurt and I...<br> but I'd hoped I made myself<br> clear to him...<br> when he asked my permission<br> to marry you.<br> Kurt asked for permission<br> to marry me?<br> But of course.<br> And I'm so sorry...<br> I cannot give it.<br> You might've told me<br> you're not a free agent.<br> I wanted her to see you.<br> I knew when she saw you<br> she would think differently.<br> She doesn't seem to.<br> Now that you've got so far...<br> perhaps you'll tell me what it is<br> you've got against me.<br> I love your son,<br> and I'm really rather a nice person.<br> Your husband is living,<br> Mrs. Dodsworth.<br> You will be divorced.<br> That's not so serious, is it?<br> It's most serious to us.<br> I have every respect<br> for your feelings...<br> but with Kurt's happiness at stake,<br> and yours, too...<br> Perhaps it's not my place<br> to bring it up...<br> but it is an argument,<br> so you'll let me use it.<br> I'm a person of considerable means<br> in my own right.<br> Enough for the three of us.<br> So you see...<br> Yes, indeed I see.<br> I do not deny that we are poor<br> since the war...<br> and your influence and money<br> would be most helpful...<br> but even if there were not the...<br> religious question...<br> What else is there?<br> Will you leave us, Kurt?<br> There is the question<br> of children too.<br> Children?<br> Rich or poor,<br> Kurt should have children...<br> to carry on his name.<br> Can you give them to him?<br> What makes you think I couldn't?<br> I am so much older<br> than you are, my dear.<br> You will forgive<br> if I observe that you are...<br> older than Kurt.<br> Well, children or no children,<br> Kurt loves me and I love him.<br> So why shouldn't we marry anyway<br> and take our happiness?<br> I do not know<br> what power you have over Kurt...<br> but I should think<br> of my own happiness if I were you.<br> I am thinking of that.<br> Have you thought...<br> how little happiness there can be...<br> for the...<br> old wife of a young husband?<br> Your mother's leaving.<br> Yes. I do not think<br> there is more to say.<br> I am sorry if I have hurt you.<br> I will go now.<br> I will go home.<br> Good-bye, my dear.<br> I'm very glad to...<br> Good-bye.<br> I will just take her to a taxi.<br> Did she say something<br> to hurt you, Fran?<br> Please don't be angry.<br> Perhaps we had better postpone<br> our marriage for a year...<br> until we win her over.<br> What are you?<br> But I must consider my mother, Fran.<br> We can still be married.<br> I'm sure of that.<br> It isn't fair.<br> Fran darling, please try.<br> I do love you, Fran.<br> But my mother...<br> My mother is waiting.<br> I want to put in<br> a long-distance call.<br> To Naples, Italy.<br> Villa Cortright.<br> Posilipo.<br> I want to speak to Mr...<br> Here?<br> Choke. You know?<br> Choke. You know choke?<br> Hi there.<br> Well, I couldn't imagine<br> what had become of you.<br> Going fishing with Pietro again?<br> Yeah. I want to show him<br> a few tricks I know.<br> Have you been expecting<br> a long-distance call?<br> Here? Heavens no.<br> That phone has been ringing all morning.<br> It doesn't make any sense at all.<br> There's that horrible putt-putt motor.<br> It's been on all morning.<br> Yeah, he's got the hang of it now.<br> Sam, that's not my Pietro.<br> Pietro's crazy about that motor.<br> You didn't put it on his boat<br> with the beautiful sail.<br> I bought that sail.<br> It's got Santa Lucia painted on it.<br> I'll have a statue<br> of Santa Lucia made.<br> We'll put her on the boat<br> holding a taillight.<br> Listen, don't be hard on me.<br> Setting up that motor's the first real<br> fun I've had since I quit business...<br> and it's got me raring to go again<br> for the first time.<br> - To go?<br> - You bet.<br> - Away from here?<br> - Anyplace I can get back in harness.<br> Something new, the way they did<br> with automobiles when they began.<br> Thought I'd try<br> my hand at aviation.<br> The idea of a Moscow-to-Seattle<br> airline kind of strikes me.<br> Moscow to Seattle?<br> Buy in on a transcontinental<br> connection.<br> With these transcontinental flights<br> coming on so well...<br> I might be the first man<br> with his first round-the-world system.<br> The Soviet people seem agreeable.<br> - Have you begun working on this?<br> - Not really working.<br> I'll tell you what we'll do.<br> We'll make a preliminary survey...<br> - "We"?<br> - I've got my pilot staked out.<br> I'll buy my own plane,<br> and the day after the divorce...<br> we'll hop off and go across...<br> "We," Sam? "We"?<br> Wait. Where's that map?<br> Vienna?<br> We were just hopping off where?<br> Siberia.<br> Pick out landing fields.<br> No ramifications.<br> A line from Irkutsk to Tashkent<br> and Samarkand.<br> Swell name, Samarkand.<br> If those Soviet boys will let me...<br> It'll be tough on you, though.<br> One suitcase in the coldest place.<br> You think you could stand it?<br> - Are you taking me with you?<br> - Don't you want to go?<br> All my life I've been waiting<br> for something exciting to happen.<br> I'll fly across Siberia with you<br> on one suitcase.<br> I'll go through life with you on one<br> suitcase, if you give me the chance.<br> I've spent six short weeks with you,<br> and I can't imagine being without you.<br> I can't imagine<br> being without you either.<br> I think I must love you<br> a great deal.<br> God bless you for that.<br> There's Pietro. You wanted<br> to go fishing. Take me with you.<br> - You want to go with us?<br> - Yes. I want to get out of here.<br> - Are you coming, Sam?<br> - Yes.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, Fran, this is Sam.<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> When are you sailing?<br> All right.<br> I'll get the tickets.<br> Well, I guess I'll have to.<br> No, that's all right.<br> All right. Good-bye.<br> She's dropped the divorce.<br> She's going home on the Rex<br> day after tomorrow from Naples.<br> I've got to go with her.<br> I won't let you.<br> - What else can I do?<br> - I won't let you go back to her.<br> I know this is a jolt.<br> It's a jolt to me too.<br> I won't see you killed<br> by her selfishness.<br> You don't understand. It'll be tough<br> on her with all the talk there'll be.<br> I love you, and she doesn't.<br> You're miserable with her.<br> I know.<br> A moment ago, you had<br> the whole world in your hands.<br> - I won't let her take it away from you.<br> - She's not taking it away.<br> - You were a young man a minute ago...<br> - I know everything's starting again.<br> You shriveled the same way,<br> every letter you got from her.<br> - I can't think.<br> - You're wrong to go back...<br> Please, be fair.<br> She's in a hole. She needs me.<br> She does not need you,<br> and you might think of me.<br> - I am thinking of you.<br> - No, I won't make you choose.<br> Think of Moscow,<br> Seattle and Samarkand.<br> I know.<br> I know every bit of it.<br> - One word from her, and you trot back.<br> - You've got to be patient with me.<br> - What is this hold she has over you?<br> - I've got to take care of her.<br> A man's habits get pretty strong<br> in 20 years.<br> I'll go into town<br> and make the reservations.<br> It's giving you up that hurts.<br> I don't see how we managed<br> to get such an awful cabin.<br> We didn't make the reservations<br> till yesterday.<br> - What are we doing here?<br> - I want a drink.<br> You can't get a drink<br> till after the boat sails.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - A brandy and soda.<br> The bar is closed<br> until the boat sails.<br> I know, but bring a brandy and soda,<br> and be quick about it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You might've asked me<br> if I wanted something.<br> Do you?<br> No, but if I'm going<br> to watch you drink...<br> Somebody has to shut that door.<br> There's an awful draft.<br> Thank you, Sammy dear.<br> It's nice to be going somewhere<br> after all these weeks.<br> Going home doesn't seem<br> so bad after all.<br> I was so bored in Vienna.<br> - Will somebody keep that door shut?<br> - You can't keep people out.<br> Do all these trippers<br> have to keep popping in and out?<br> - They have as much right as we have.<br> - That's right, stand up for them.<br> But you'll have to get my wrap.<br> Well, it's closed now.<br> Well, if they keep it closed.<br> All right. Go on.<br> You were saying?<br> Oh, yes. You were right about Kurt.<br> I can't think how you guessed it.<br> You're not good at judging people,<br> except in the case of businessmen.<br> His family may be as old as the<br> Coliseum, but when I saw his mother...<br> my dear, the most awful,<br> old country frump.<br> Don't.<br> Sammy, please.<br> Don't ride Kurt and his mother<br> that way, that's all.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'll be good.<br> I didn't expect you to defend them.<br> I suppose I ought to beg you<br> to forgive me.<br> But you always<br> let bygones be bygones...<br> and this is such a happy ending<br> to our escapades.<br> All ashore go ashore!<br> See the hat that woman had on?<br> I wonder why they allow<br> such people in first class.<br> Wait until you see the clothes<br> I bought in Vienna.<br> When I think of the things<br> poor Matey Pearson puts on her back...<br> You seem a little distrait,<br> considering our reunion.<br> Maybe I don't like<br> your riding Matey that way either.<br> I don't seem to be able<br> to strike the congenial note.<br> I do think<br> you might meet me halfway.<br> After all, as I look back,<br> I don't blame myself. I can't really.<br> You were a good deal at fault too.<br> - Steward.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Take this check,<br> go to suite seven on B deck...<br> get the suitcase with that number<br> on it and bring it here right away.<br> I'm not sailing with you.<br> - You're not sailing?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> You and I can't make<br> a go of things any longer.<br> - This is the man I loved for 20 years.<br> - This is the man who's loved you.<br> You haven't learned a single thing<br> from all our sorrows.<br> And I flattered myself<br> you really wanted to come back to me.<br> I tried, didn't I?<br> I might've known you'd be just the same,<br> yet I gave you another chance.<br> I'm not taking another chance,<br> because I'm through, finished.<br> - What's going to become of me?<br> - You'll stop getting younger someday.<br> Are you going back to that<br> washed-out, expatriate in Naples?<br> Yes. When I marry her,<br> I'm going back to doing things.<br> You think you'll ever get me<br> out of your blood?<br> Maybe not, but love has gotta stop<br> someplace short of suicide.<br> But the gentleman<br> will miss the boat.<br> He's gone ashore!<br>
