                        Why, hello there,<br> Mr. Neff.<br> - Working pretty late, aren't you,<br> Mr. Neff? - Late enough. Let's ride.<br> - You look kind of all in, at that.<br> - I'm fine.<br> - How is the insurance business,<br> Mr. Neff? - Okay.<br> They wouldn't ever<br> sell me any.<br> They said I have<br> something loose in my heart.<br> - I say it's rheumatism.<br> - Yeah?<br> Twelve.<br> Office memorandum.<br> Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,<br> Claims Manager.<br> Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.<br> Dear Keyes...<br> I suppose you'll call this<br> a confession when you hear it.<br> Well, I don't like<br> the word confession.<br> I just want to set you right<br> about something you couldn't see...<br> because it was smack up<br> against your nose.<br> You think you're such a hot potato<br> as a Claims Manager...<br> such a wolf on a phony claim.<br> Maybe you are, but let's take a look<br> at that Dietrichson claim.<br> Accident and double indemnity.<br> You were pretty good in there<br> for a while, Keyes.<br> You said it wasn't<br> an accident. Check.<br> You said it wasn't suicide.<br> Check.<br> You said it was murder. Check.<br> You thought you had it cold,<br> didn't you?<br> All wrapped up in tissue paper,<br> with pink ribbons around it.<br> It was perfect.<br> Except it wasn't, because<br> you made one mistake...<br> just one little mistake.<br> When it came to picking the killer,<br> you picked the wrong guy.<br> You want to know who<br> killed Dietrichson?<br> Hold tight to that<br> cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.<br> I killed Dietrichson.<br> Me, Walter Neff,<br> insurance salesman.<br> no visible scars...<br> until a while ago, that is.<br> Yes, I killed him.<br> I killed him for money...<br> and for a woman.<br> And I didn't get the money<br> and I didn't get the woman.<br> Pretty, isn't it?<br> It all began last May.<br> Around the end of May, it was.<br> I'd been out to Glendale to deliver<br> a policy on some dairy trucks.<br> On the way back I remembered this<br> auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard.<br> So I drove over there.<br> It was one of those<br> California Spanish houses...<br> everyone was nuts about<br> 10 or 15 years ago.<br> This one must've cost somebody<br> about $30,000.<br> That is, if he ever<br> finished paying for it.<br> Is Mr. Dietrichson in?<br> - Who wants to see him?<br> - My name is Neff. Walter Neff.<br> - If you're selling something... - Look,<br> it's Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to...<br> and it's not<br> magazine subscriptions.<br> - Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not in.<br> - How soon do you expect him?<br> He'll be home when he gets here,<br> if that's any help to you.<br> What is it, Nettie? Who is it?<br> It's for Mr. Dietrichson.<br> I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> What is it?<br> How do you do,<br> Mrs. Dietrichson?<br> I'm Walter Neff,<br> Pacific All Risk.<br> - Pacific all what? - The Pacific<br> All Risk Insurance Company.<br> It's about some renewals<br> on the automobiles.<br> I've been trying to contact your<br> husband for the past two weeks...<br> but he's never in his office.<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> The insurance ran out<br> on the 15th.<br> I'd hate to think of your<br> having a smashed fender...<br> or something<br> while you're not...<br> fully covered.<br> Perhaps I know<br> what you mean, Mr. Neff.<br> - I've just been taking a sunbath.<br> - No pigeons around, I hope.<br> About those policies, Mrs. Dietrichson,<br> I hate to take up your time, but...<br> Oh, that's all right.<br> If you'll wait till I put<br> something on, I'll be right down.<br> Nettie, show Mr. Neff<br> into the living room.<br> Where would<br> the living room be?<br> In there, but they keep<br> the liquor locked up.<br> It's all right.<br> I always carry my own keys.<br> The living room<br> was still stuffy...<br> from last night's cigars.<br> The windows were closed...<br> and the sunshine coming in<br> through the venetian blinds...<br> showed up the dust in the air.<br> On the piano, in a couple of fancy frames,<br> were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola...<br> his daughter<br> by his first wife.<br> They had a bowl of those<br> little red goldfish...<br> on the table behind<br> the big davenport.<br> But to tell you<br> the truth, Keyes...<br> I wasn't a whole lot interested<br> in goldfish right then.<br> Or in auto renewals, or in Mr. Dietrichson<br> and his daughter Lola.<br> I was thinking about that dame upstairs,<br> and the way she had looked at me...<br> and I wanted<br> to see her again, close...<br> without that silly staircase<br> between us.<br> - I wasn't long, was I?<br> - Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> - Hope I've got my face on straight.<br> - It's perfect, for my money.<br> - Neff is the name, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> With two "F's," like in Philadelphia,<br> if you know the story.<br> - What story?<br> - The Philadelphia Story.<br> Suppose we sit down and you tell me<br> about the insurance.<br> My husband never<br> tells me anything.<br> Well, it's on your two cars,<br> the LaSalle and the Plymouth.<br> We've been handling this insurance<br> for Mr. Dietrichson for three years...<br> and we'd hate to see<br> the policies lapse.<br> That's a honey of an anklet<br> you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> As I was saying, we'd hate to see<br> the policies lapse.<br> Of course, we give them 30 days.<br> That's all we're allowed to give.<br> I guess he's been too busy down<br> at Long Beach in the oil fields.<br> Couldn't I catch him at home<br> some evening for a few minutes?<br> I suppose so. But he's never<br> home much before 8:00.<br> That's fine with me.<br> You're not connected<br> with the Automobile Club, are you?<br> No, the All Risk,<br> Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?<br> Somebody from the Automobile Club<br> has been trying to get him.<br> - Do they have a better rate?<br> - If your husband's a member.<br> No, he isn't.<br> Well, then he'd have to join the club<br> and pay the membership fee to start with.<br> I never knock the other fellow's<br> merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> The Automobile Club's fine.<br> I can do just as well for you, though.<br> I have a very attractive<br> policy here.<br> It wouldn't take me two minutes<br> to put it in front of your husband.<br> For instance, we're writing<br> a new kind of 50% retention feature...<br> in the collision coverage.<br> You're a smart insurance man,<br> aren't you, Mr. Neff?<br> - Well, I've been at it 11 years.<br> - Doing pretty well?<br> It's a living.<br> You handle just automobile insurance,<br> or all kinds?<br> All kinds. Fire, earthquake, theft,<br> public liability, group insurance...<br> industrial stuff and so on,<br> right down the line.<br> Accident insurance?<br> Accident insurance?<br> Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> Wish you'd tell me<br> what's engraved on that anklet.<br> - Just my name.<br> - As, for instance?<br> - Phyllis.<br> - Phyllis, huh?<br> - I think I like that.<br> - But you're not sure?<br> I'd have to drive it around<br> the block a couple of times.<br> Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by<br> tomorrow evening around 8:30?<br> - He'll be in then.<br> - Who?<br> My husband. You were anxious<br> to talk to him, weren't you?<br> Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of<br> getting over the idea...<br> if you know what I mean.<br> There's a speed limit in this state,<br> Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.<br> - How fast was I going, officer?<br> - I'd say around 90.<br> Suppose you get down off your<br> motorcycle and give me a ticket.<br> Suppose I let you off<br> with a warning this time.<br> Suppose it doesn't take.<br> Suppose I have to whack you<br> over the knuckles.<br> Suppose I bust out crying<br> and put my head on your shoulder.<br> Suppose you try putting it<br> on my husband's shoulder.<br> That tears it.<br> - 8:30 tomorrow evening then.<br> - That's what I suggested.<br> - Will you be here, too?<br> - I guess so, I usually am.<br> Same chair, same perfume,<br> same anklet?<br> I wonder if I know<br> what you mean.<br> I wonder if you wonder.<br> It was a hot afternoon<br> and I can still remember...<br> the smell of honeysuckle<br> all along that street.<br> How could I have known that murder<br> can sometimes smell like honeysuckle?<br> Maybe you would<br> have known, Keyes...<br> the minute she mentioned<br> accident insurance, but I didn't.<br> I felt like a million.<br> I went back to the office<br> to see if I had any mail.<br> It was the day you had that truck driver<br> from Inglewood on the carpet.<br> Remember, Keyes?<br> Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes<br> wants to see you.<br> He's been yelling for you<br> all afternoon.<br> Is he sore, or just frothing<br> at the mouth a little?<br> Park this for me,<br> will you, sweetheart?<br> - Hello, Walter.<br> - Hi, George.<br> Come on. Come on, Garlopis.<br> You're not kidding anybody<br> with that line of bull.<br> - You're in a jam and you know it.<br> - Says you.<br> - All I want is my money.<br> - Says you.<br> All you're gonna get<br> is the cops. Hello, Walter.<br> - This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood.<br> - Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.<br> Wrote a policy on his truck.<br> How are you, Mr. Garlopis?<br> - I ain't so good. My truck burned down.<br> - Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.<br> Every month hundreds of claims<br> come to this desk.<br> Some of them are phonies,<br> and I know which ones.<br> How do I know? Because<br> my little man tells me.<br> - What little man?<br> - The little man in here.<br> Every time one of these phonies<br> comes along, it ties knots in my stomach.<br> I can't eat.<br> Yours is one of them, Garlopis.<br> That's how I knew your claim was crooked.<br> So what did I do?<br> I sent a tow car over to your<br> garage this afternoon...<br> and they jacked up that<br> burned-out truck of yours.<br> And what did they find?<br> They found what was left<br> of a neat pile of shavings.<br> What shavings?<br> The ones you soaked with kerosene<br> and dropped a match on.<br> Look, Mister, I'm just a poor guy.<br> Maybe I made a mistake.<br> That's one way of putting it.<br> I ain't feeling so good,<br> Mr. Keyes.<br> Here. Just a minute.<br> Sign this and you'll feel fine.<br> - Sign what? - It's a waiver<br> on your claim. Right here.<br> - Here?<br> - Here.<br> Now you're an honest man again.<br> Goodbye, Garlopis.<br> But I ain't got no more truck.<br> $2,600 is lot of dough<br> where I live.<br> What's the matter, Garlopis,<br> don't you know how to open the door?<br> Just put your hand<br> on the knob, turn it to the left.<br> Now pull it toward you.<br> - That's the boy.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Keyes.<br> What kind of an outfit<br> is this, anyway?<br> Are we an insurance company,<br> or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...<br> to write a policy<br> on a mug like that?<br> Now, wait a minute, Keyes.<br> I don't rate this beef.<br> I clipped a note to that<br> Garlopis application...<br> to have him<br> thoroughly investigated...<br> - before we accepted the risk.<br> - I know you did, Walter.<br> I'm not beefing at you. It's the company.<br> It's the way they do things.<br> The way they don't do things!<br> The way they'll write anything<br> just to get it down on the sales sheet.<br> And I'm the guy that has to<br> sit here up to my neck in phony claims...<br> so they won't throw more money out<br> the window than they take in at the door.<br> Okay, turn the record over,<br> let's hear the other side.<br> Well, I get darn sick of trying to pick up<br> after a gang of fast-talking salesmen...<br> dumb enough to sell<br> life insurance to a guy...<br> who sleeps in the same bed<br> with four rattlesnakes.<br> Walter, I've had 26 years of this<br> and let me tell you, I'm getting...<br> Yeah, and you've loved<br> every minute of it, Keyes.<br> You love it, only you worry about it<br> too darn much, you and your little man.<br> You're so darn conscientious,<br> you're driving yourself crazy.<br> You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday<br> unless you looked at the calendar.<br> Then you'd check to see if it was<br> this year's or last year's calendar.<br> Then you'd find out<br> who printed the calendar...<br> and find out if their calendar checked<br> with the World Almanac's calendar.<br> Now, that's enough<br> from you, Walter.<br> Now, get out of here<br> before I throw my desk at you.<br> I love you, too.<br> I really did, too,<br> you old crab...<br> always yelling your head off,<br> always sore at everybody.<br> But you never fooled me with your<br> song and dance. Not for a second.<br> I kind of always knew that behind<br> the cigar ashes on your vest...<br> you had a heart<br> as big as a house.<br> Back in my office there was<br> a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson...<br> about the renewals.<br> She didn't want me to come<br> tomorrow evening.<br> She wanted me to come<br> Thursday afternoon at 3.30 instead.<br> I had a lot of stuff lined up<br> for that Thursday afternoon...<br> including a trip<br> down to Santa Monica...<br> to see a couple of live prospects<br> about some group insurance.<br> But I kept thinking<br> about Phyllis Dietrichson...<br> and the way that<br> anklet of hers cut into her leg.<br> Hello, Mr. Neff.<br> Aren't you coming in?<br> I'm considering it.<br> I hope you didn't mind<br> my changing the appointment.<br> - Last night wasn't so convenient.<br> - That's all right.<br> I was working on<br> my stamp collection anyway.<br> I was just fixing some iced tea.<br> Would you like a glass?<br> Yeah, unless you've got<br> a bottle of beer that's not working.<br> There may be some.<br> I never know what's in the icebox.<br> Nettie.<br> About those renewals, Mr. Neff.<br> I talked to my husband about it.<br> - Oh, you did? - Yes. He'll renew<br> with you, he told me so.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I thought he'd be here this afternoon.<br> - But he's not?<br> - No.<br> That's terrible.<br> Nettie!<br> Oh, I forgot,<br> today's the maid's day off.<br> Never mind the beer.<br> Iced tea will be fine.<br> - Lemon? Sugar?<br> - Fix it your way.<br> As long as it's the maid's day off,<br> maybe there's something I can do for you.<br> - Like running the vacuum cleaner.<br> - Fresh.<br> I used to peddle<br> vacuum cleaners.<br> Not much money,<br> but you learn a lot about life.<br> I didn't think you'd learned it<br> from a correspondence course.<br> Where'd you pick up<br> this tea drinking?<br> - You're not English, are you?<br> - No. Californian.<br> Born right here<br> in Los Angeles.<br> They say all native Californians<br> come from Iowa.<br> - Mr. Neff, I...<br> - Make it Walter, huh?<br> - Walter.<br> - That's right.<br> Tell me, Walter, on this insurance,<br> how much commission do you make?<br> Twenty percent. Why?<br> I thought perhaps I could throw<br> a little more business your way.<br> - I can always use it.<br> - I was thinking about my husband.<br> I worry a lot about him<br> down in those oil fields.<br> - It's very dangerous.<br> - Not for an executive, is it?<br> He doesn't just sit<br> behind a desk.<br> He's right down there<br> with those drilling crews.<br> It's got me worried sick.<br> You mean, some dark night<br> a crown block might fall on him?<br> - Please don't talk like that.<br> - But that's the idea.<br> The other day a casing line snapped<br> and caught the foreman.<br> - He's in the hospital<br> with a broken back. - That's bad.<br> It's got me jittery<br> just thinking about it.<br> Suppose something like that<br> happened to my husband.<br> - It could.<br> - Well...<br> don't you think he ought<br> to have accident insurance?<br> What kind of insurance<br> could he have?<br> Enough to cover doctors<br> and hospital bills.<br> Say $125 a week cash benefit.<br> And he'd rate around<br> $50,000 capital sum.<br> - Capital sum? What's that?<br> - In case he gets killed.<br> Maybe I shouldn't<br> have said that.<br> I suppose you have to think<br> of everything in your business.<br> Well, your husband<br> would understand.<br> I'm sure I could sell him on the idea<br> of some accident protection.<br> Why don't I talk<br> to him about it?<br> You could try,<br> but he's pretty tough-going.<br> They're all tough at first.<br> He has a lot on his mind.<br> He doesn't seem to want<br> to listen to anything...<br> except maybe<br> a baseball game on the radio.<br> Sometimes we sit here all evening<br> and never say a word to each other.<br> - Sounds pretty dull.<br> - So, I just sit and knit.<br> Is that what you<br> married him for?<br> Maybe I like the way<br> his thumbs hold up the wool.<br> Anytime his thumbs<br> get tired...<br> Only, with me around,<br> you wouldn't have to knit.<br> - Wouldn't I?<br> - You bet your life, you wouldn't.<br> Wonder if a little rum<br> would get this up on its feet.<br> I want to ask you<br> something, Walter.<br> Could I get an accident policy for him<br> without bothering him at all?<br> How's that, again?<br> It would make it easier for you, too.<br> You wouldn't even have to talk to him.<br> I have a little<br> allowance of my own.<br> I could pay for it and he needn't<br> know anything about it.<br> Why shouldn't he know?<br> Because he doesn't want<br> accident insurance.<br> - He's superstitious about it. - A lot<br> of people are. That's funny, isn't it?<br> If there was a way to get it like that,<br> all the worry would be over.<br> - See what I mean, Walter?<br> - Sure. I got good eyesight.<br> You mean you want him to have<br> the policy without him knowing it.<br> And that means without the insurance<br> company knowing that he doesn't know it.<br> - That's the setup, isn't it?<br> - Is there anything wrong with it?<br> No, I think it's lovely.<br> Then, if some dark, wet night,<br> that crown block did fall on him...<br> What crown block?<br> Only sometimes it can't quite make it<br> on its own, it has to have a little help.<br> I don't know what<br> you're talking about.<br> Of course, it doesn't have<br> to be a crown block.<br> It can be a car backing over him, or he<br> could fall out of the upstairs window.<br> Any little thing like that,<br> just so it's a morgue job.<br> - Are you crazy?<br> - Not that crazy.<br> - Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Look, baby,<br> you can't get away with it.<br> You want to knock him off,<br> don't you?<br> That's a horrible<br> thing to say.<br> What'd you think<br> I was, anyway?<br> A guy that walks into a good looking<br> dame's front parlor and says:<br> "Good afternoon, I sell<br> accident insurance on husbands.<br> "You got one that's been<br> around too long?<br> "One you'd like to turn into<br> a little hard cash?<br> "Just give me a smile<br> and I'll help you collect."<br> - Boy, what a dope you must think I am.<br> - I think you're rotten.<br> I think you're swell,<br> so long as I'm not your husband.<br> - Get out of here.<br> - You bet I'll get out of here, baby.<br> I'll get out of here,<br> but quick.<br> So I let her have it<br> straight between the eyes.<br> She didn't fool me<br> for a minute, not this time.<br> I knew I had hold<br> of a red-hot poker...<br> and the time to drop it<br> was before it burned my hand off.<br> I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer,<br> the one I had wanted all along...<br> only I wanted it worse now, to get<br> rid of the sour taste of her iced tea...<br> and everything<br> that went with it.<br> I didn't want to go back to the office<br> so I dropped by a bowling alley...<br> at Third and Western<br> and rolled a few lines...<br> to get my mind thinking about<br> something else for a while.<br> I didn't feel like eating dinner when<br> I left, and I didn't feel like a show.<br> So, I drove home, put the car away<br> and went up to my apartment.<br> It had begun to rain outside<br> and I watched it get dark...<br> and didn't even<br> turn on the light.<br> That didn't help me either.<br> I was all twisted up inside...<br> and I was still holding on<br> to that red-hot poker.<br> And right then it came over me that<br> I hadn't walked out on anything at all.<br> That the hook<br> was too strong...<br> that this wasn't the end<br> between her and me.<br> It was only the beginning.<br> So at 8.00 the bell would ring and I'd know<br> who it was without even having to think.<br> As if it was the most<br> natural thing in the world.<br> Hello. You forgot your hat<br> this afternoon.<br> - Did I?<br> - Don't you want me to bring it in?<br> Sure.<br> Put it on the chair.<br> - How'd you know where I live?<br> - It's in the phone book.<br> - It's raining.<br> - Yeah.<br> Peel off your coat<br> and sit down.<br> Your husband out?<br> Yes. Long Beach.<br> They're spudding in a new well.<br> He phoned he'd be late.<br> About 9:30.<br> It's about time you said<br> you were glad to see me.<br> I knew you wouldn't<br> leave it like that.<br> - Like what?<br> - Like it was this afternoon.<br> I must have said something that gave you<br> a terribly wrong impression.<br> You must never think anything<br> like that about me, Walter.<br> - Okay.<br> - No, it's not okay.<br> - Not if you don't believe me.<br> - What do you want me to do?<br> I want you to be nice to me.<br> Like the first time<br> you came to the house.<br> It can't be<br> like the first time.<br> - Something's happened.<br> - I know it has.<br> It's happened to us.<br> I feel as if he was watching me.<br> Not that he cares. Not anymore.<br> He keeps me on a leash<br> so tight I can't breathe.<br> He's in Long Beach,<br> isn't he? Relax.<br> Maybe I oughtn't<br> to have come.<br> - Maybe you oughtn't.<br> - You want me to go?<br> - If you want to.<br> - Right now?<br> Sure, right now.<br> - I'm crazy about you, baby.<br> - I'm crazy about you, Walter.<br> That perfume on your hair.<br> What's the name of it?<br> I don't know.<br> I bought it in Ensenada.<br> You ought to have some of that<br> pink wine to go with it.<br> The kind that bubbles.<br> All I got is bourbon.<br> Bourbon is fine, Walter.<br> Get a couple of glasses,<br> will you?<br> - Club soda?<br> - Plain water, please.<br> You know, about six months ago a guy<br> slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub...<br> and knocked himself cold<br> and was drowned.<br> Only he had<br> accident insurance.<br> So they had an autopsy<br> and she didn't get away with it.<br> - Who didn't?<br> - His wife.<br> Then there was a case of a guy<br> who was found shot.<br> His wife said he was cleaning a gun<br> and his stomach got in the way.<br> All she collected was<br> a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.<br> Perhaps it was<br> worth it to her.<br> See if you can carry that<br> as far as the living room.<br> It's nice here, Walter.<br> Who takes care of it for you?<br> A colored woman comes in<br> a couple of times a week.<br> - Cook your own breakfast?<br> - Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while.<br> - Get the rest down at the<br> corner drugstore. - Sounds wonderful.<br> Just strangers beside you.<br> You don't know them<br> and you don't hate them.<br> You don't have to<br> sit across the table...<br> and smile at him and that daughter<br> of his every morning of your life.<br> What daughter? You mean<br> the little girl on the piano?<br> Lola. She lives with us.<br> He thinks a lot more of her<br> than he does of me.<br> - You ever think of a divorce?<br> - He wouldn't give me a divorce.<br> I suppose because<br> it'd cost him too much money.<br> He hasn't got any money.<br> Not since he went into the oil business.<br> But he had<br> when you married him?<br> Yes, he had.<br> And I wanted a home. Why not?<br> But that's not the only reason.<br> I was his wife's nurse.<br> She was sick a long time.<br> When she died, he was terribly broken up.<br> - I pitied him so.<br> - And now you hate him.<br> Yes, Walter.<br> He's so mean to me.<br> Every time I buy a dress or<br> a pair of shoes he yells his head off.<br> He never lets me go anywhere.<br> He keeps me shut up.<br> He's always been mean to me.<br> Even his life insurance<br> all goes to that daughter of his.<br> - That Lola.<br> - Nothing for you at all?<br> No. And nothing is just<br> what I'm worth to him.<br> So you lie awake in the dark<br> and listen to him snore and get ideas.<br> Walter, I don't want<br> to kill him. I never did.<br> Not even when he gets drunk<br> and slaps my face.<br> - Only sometimes you wish he was dead.<br> - Perhaps I do.<br> Then you wish it was an accident,<br> and you had that policy for $50,000.<br> - Is that it?<br> - Perhaps that, too.<br> The other night we drove home<br> from a party. He was drunk again.<br> When we drove into the garage, he just sat<br> there with his head on the steering wheel...<br> and the motor still running.<br> And I thought what it would be like<br> if I didn't switch it off...<br> just closed the garage doors<br> and left him there.<br> I'll tell you what<br> it'd be like.<br> If you had that accident policy<br> and tried to pull a monoxide job...<br> We've got a guy<br> in our office named Keyes.<br> For him a setup like that'd be<br> just like a slice of rare roast beef.<br> In three minutes he'd know<br> it wasn't an accident.<br> In 10 minutes you'd be sitting<br> under the hot lights.<br> In a half-hour you'd be<br> signing your name to a confession.<br> But, Walter, I didn't do it<br> and I'm not going to do it.<br> Not if there's an insurance company<br> in the picture, baby.<br> They know more tricks<br> than a carload of monkeys.<br> And if there's a death mixed up in it,<br> you haven't got a prayer.<br> They'll hang you just as sure<br> as ten dimes will buy a dollar.<br> And I don't want you<br> to hang, baby.<br> Stop thinking about it,<br> will you?<br> So we just sat there.<br> She started crying softly, like the rain<br> on the window, and we didn't say anything.<br> Maybe she had stopped<br> thinking about it, but I hadn't.<br> I couldn't.<br> Because it all tied up with something<br> I'd been thinking about for years.<br> Since long before I ever<br> ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.<br> Because you know<br> how it is, Keyes.<br> In this business<br> you can't sleep...<br> for trying to figure out<br> all the tricks they could pull on you.<br> You're like the guy<br> behind the roulette wheel...<br> watching the customers to make sure<br> they don't crook the house.<br> And then one night, you get to thinking<br> how you could crook the house yourself.<br> And do it smart.<br> Because you've got that wheel<br> right under your hands.<br> You know every notch in it<br> by heart.<br> And you figure all you need<br> is a plant out front.<br> A shill to put down the bet.<br> And suddenly<br> the doorbell rings...<br> and the whole setup<br> is right there in the room with you.<br> Look, Keyes, I'm not trying<br> to whitewash myself.<br> I fought it, only I guess<br> I didn't fight it hard enough.<br> The stakes were $50,000,<br> but they were the life of a man, too.<br> A man who'd never<br> done me any dirt, except...<br> he was married to a woman<br> he didn't care anything about.<br> And I did.<br> Will you phone me?<br> Walter?<br> I hate him.<br> I loathe going back to him.<br> - You believe me, don't you, Walter?<br> - Sure I believe you.<br> I can't stand it anymore.<br> What if they did hang me?<br> They're not going<br> to hang you, baby.<br> It's better than<br> going on this way.<br> They're not gonna<br> hang you because...<br> you're gonna do it<br> and I'm gonna help you.<br> - Do you know what you're saying?<br> - Sure, I know what I'm saying.<br> We're gonna do it<br> and we're gonna do it right.<br> - And I'm the guy that knows how.<br> - Walter, you're hurting me.<br> There's not going to be any slip-up.<br> Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.<br> It's got to be perfect.<br> Call me tomorrow.<br> But not from your house. From a booth.<br> And watch your step<br> every single minute.<br> This has got to be perfect, you understand?<br> Straight down the line.<br> Straight down the line.<br> That was it, Keyes.<br> The machinery had started to move<br> and nothing could stop it.<br> The first thing we had to do was<br> fix him up with that accident policy.<br> I knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted<br> was his signature on an application.<br> So I had to get him to sign without<br> his knowing what he was signing.<br> And I wanted another witness besides<br> Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk.<br> I was trying to think<br> with your brains, Keyes...<br> because I wanted<br> all the answers ready...<br> for all the questions you were gonna<br> spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead.<br> A couple of nights later<br> I went to the house.<br> Everything looked fine, except I didn't<br> like the witness Phyllis had brought in.<br> It was Dietrichson's<br> daughter, Lola.<br> And it made me feel<br> a little queer in the belly...<br> to have her sitting right there<br> in the room, playing Chinese checkers...<br> as if nothing<br> were going to happen.<br> I suppose you realize,<br> Mr. Dietrichson...<br> that, not being an employee...<br> you are not covered by<br> the State Compensation Insurance Act.<br> The only way you can protect yourself is<br> by having a personal policy of your own.<br> Yeah, I know<br> all about that.<br> The next thing<br> you'll tell me I need...<br> earthquake insurance and<br> lightning insurance and hail insurance.<br> If we bought all the insurance<br> they can think up...<br> we'd stay broke paying for it,<br> wouldn't we, honey?<br> What keeps us broke is you going out<br> and buying five hats at a crack.<br> Who needs a hat in California?<br> Dollar for dollar,<br> Mr. Dietrichson...<br> accident insurance is<br> the cheapest coverage you can buy.<br> Well, maybe some other time,<br> Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.<br> Just as you say.<br> Suppose we just settle<br> that automobile insurance tonight.<br> Sure.<br> All we'll need on that is for you<br> to sign the application for renewal.<br> Phyllis, do you mind<br> if we don't finish this game?<br> - It bores me stiff.<br> - Got something better to do?<br> Yes, I have.<br> Father, is it all right<br> if I run along now?<br> - Run along where? Who with?<br> - Just Anne. We're going roller-skating.<br> - Anne who?<br> - Anne Matthews.<br> It's not that<br> Nino Zachetti again, is it?<br> It better not be<br> that Zachetti guy.<br> If I ever catch you<br> with that...<br> It's Anne Matthews,<br> I told you.<br> And I also told you<br> we're going roller-skating.<br> I'm meeting her at the corner of Vermont<br> and Franklin, the northwest corner...<br> in case you're interested,<br> and I'm late already.<br> I hope that's all quite clear.<br> Good night, Father.<br> - Good night, Phyllis.<br> - Good night, Miss Dietrichson.<br> - I'm sorry. Good night, Mr...<br> - Neff.<br> Good night, Mr. Neff.<br> A great little fighter<br> for her weight.<br> Now, if you'll just<br> sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.<br> - Sign what? - The applications<br> for the auto renewals.<br> So you'll be covered until<br> the new policies are issued.<br> - When will that be?<br> - About a week.<br> Just so I'm covered<br> when I drive up north.<br> - San Francisco?<br> - Palo Alto.<br> He was a Stanford man,<br> Mr. Neff.<br> And he still goes to his<br> class reunion every year.<br> What's wrong with that? Can't I have<br> a little fun, even once a year?<br> Great football school,<br> Stanford.<br> - Did you play football, Mr. Dietrichson?<br> - Left guard.<br> Almost made the varsity, too.<br> Where do I sign?<br> The bottom line.<br> - Both copies, please.<br> - Sign twice, huh?<br> Yes. One is<br> the agent's copy.<br> - I need it for my files.<br> - Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.<br> Thank you,<br> Mr. Dietrichson.<br> Don't worry about the check, I can<br> pick it up at your office some morning.<br> - How much you taking me for?<br> - $147.50.<br> I think that's enough<br> insurance for one evening, Mr. Neff.<br> Plenty.<br> Bring me some soda when you<br> come up, Phyllis. Good night, Mr. Neff.<br> Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.<br> I think you left your hat<br> in the hall, Mr. Neff.<br> Good night, Mr. Neff.<br> - All right, Walter?<br> - Fine.<br> - He signed it, didn't he?<br> - Sure he signed it. You saw him.<br> Now, listen. That trip to Palo Alto.<br> When does he leave?<br> End of the month.<br> - He drives, huh?<br> - He always drives.<br> Not this time. You're gonna<br> make him take the train.<br> - Why? - Because it's<br> all worked out for a train.<br> Listen, baby. There's a clause<br> in every accident policy...<br> a little thing called<br> double indemnity.<br> The insurance companies put it in<br> as a sort of come-on for the customers.<br> That means they pay double<br> on certain accidents.<br> The kind that almost<br> never happen.<br> Like for instance, if a guy<br> is killed on the train...<br> they pay $100,000<br> instead of $50,000.<br> - I see.<br> - We're hitting it for the limit, baby.<br> That's why<br> it's got to be the train.<br> It'll be the train, Walter.<br> Just the way you want it.<br> Straight down the line.<br> Hello, Mr. Neff.<br> It's me.<br> - Is anything wrong?<br> - I've been waiting for you.<br> For me? Why?<br> I thought you could let me ride<br> with you, if you're going my way.<br> - Which way would that be?<br> - Down the hill. Down Vermont.<br> Sure. Vermont and Franklin.<br> Northwest corner, wasn't it?<br> Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.<br> Going roller-skating, huh?<br> - You like roller-skating?<br> - I can take it or leave it.<br> - Only tonight you're leaving it?<br> - Yes, I am.<br> I'm having<br> a very tough time at home.<br> My father doesn't understand me<br> and Phyllis hates me.<br> - Sounds tough, all right.<br> - That's why I have to lie sometimes.<br> You mean it's not<br> Vermont and Franklin?<br> It's Vermont and Franklin<br> all right.<br> Only it's not Anne Matthews.<br> It's Nino Zachetti.<br> You won't tell on me,<br> will you?<br> - I'd have to think it over.<br> - Nino's not what my father says at all.<br> He's just had bad luck.<br> He was doing premed at USC...<br> and working nights as an usher<br> in a theater downtown.<br> Got behind in his credits,<br> flunked out.<br> Then he lost his job for talking back.<br> He's so hot-headed.<br> Becomes expensive, doesn't it?<br> Guess my father thinks nobody's<br> good enough for his daughter...<br> except maybe the guy that<br> owns Standard Oil.<br> I wish he'd see it my way.<br> I can't give Nino up.<br> It'll all straighten out,<br> Miss Dietrichson.<br> I suppose it will sometime.<br> This is the corner right here, Mr. Neff.<br> Nino? Over here, Nino.<br> - This is Mr. Neff, Nino.<br> - Hello, Nino.<br> The name is Zachetti.<br> Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave me<br> a ride from the house.<br> I told him all about us.<br> Why does he have to<br> get told about us?<br> We don't have to worry<br> about Mr. Neff, Nino.<br> I'm not doing any worrying.<br> Just don't you<br> broadcast so much.<br> Well, what's the matter<br> with you, Nino?<br> - Why, he's a friend.<br> - I don't have any friends.<br> If I did, I like to pick them myself.<br> Come on.<br> Look, sonny, she needed a ride,<br> so I brought her along.<br> Is that anything<br> to get tough about?<br> All right, Lola, make up your mind.<br> Are you coming or aren't you?<br> Of course I'm coming.<br> Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.<br> And thanks a lot for the ride.<br> You're awfully sweet. Nino?<br> She was a nice kid.<br> Maybe he was a little better<br> than he sounded.<br> But right then it gave me a nasty feeling<br> to be thinking about them at all...<br> with that briefcase right behind my head<br> that had her father's signature in it...<br> and what that signature meant.<br> It meant he was a dead pigeon.<br> It was only a question of time,<br> and not very much time at that.<br> You know that big market<br> up on Los Feliz, Keyes?<br> That's the place Phyllis and I<br> had picked for a meeting place.<br> I already had most of<br> the plan in my head...<br> but a lot of details<br> had to be worked out.<br> And she had to know them<br> all by heart when the time came.<br> We had to be very careful<br> from now on.<br> We couldn't let anybody<br> see us together.<br> We couldn't even talk to each other<br> on the telephone.<br> Not from her house<br> or at my office, anyway.<br> So she was to be in the market<br> every morning about 11.00, buying stuff.<br> And I could sort of run into her there<br> any day I wanted to.<br> Sort of accidentally<br> on purpose.<br> - Walter, I wanted to...<br> - Not so loud.<br> I wanted to talk to you,<br> ever since yesterday.<br> Let me talk first.<br> It's all set.<br> The accident policy came through.<br> I've got it in my pocket.<br> I got his check, too.<br> I saw him down in the oil fields.<br> He thought he was paying<br> for the auto insurance.<br> The check's just made out to the company,<br> so it could be for anything.<br> But you have to send a check<br> for the auto insurance, see?<br> It'll be all right that way,<br> because one of the cars is in your name.<br> Open your bag. Quick.<br> Can you get in<br> the safe-deposit box?<br> - Yes. We both have keys.<br> - Fine.<br> But don't put the policy<br> in there yet. I'll tell you when.<br> Remember, you never saw it, you never<br> even touched it, you understand?<br> - I'm not a fool. - Okay.<br> When is he leaving on the train?<br> - That's just it. He isn't going.<br> - What?<br> That's what I've been trying<br> to tell you. The trip is off.<br> What happened?<br> Mister, could you reach me<br> that package of baby food?<br> That one up there?<br> I don't know why they always put<br> what I want on the top shelf.<br> Go ahead. I'm listening.<br> He had a fall-down at the well.<br> Broke his leg. It's in a cast.<br> - Broke his leg?<br> - What do we do now, Walter?<br> - Nothing. We just wait.<br> - Wait for what?<br> Until he can<br> take the train.<br> I told you it's got<br> to be the train.<br> But we can't wait.<br> I can't go on like this.<br> Look, we're not gonna grab a hammer and<br> do it quick, just to get it over with.<br> - There are other ways.<br> - We're not gonna do it other ways.<br> But we can't leave it<br> like this.<br> What do you suppose would happen if<br> he found out about the accident policy?<br> Plenty. But not as bad as sitting<br> in that death house.<br> Don't ever talk like that. - Don't let's<br> start losing our heads, that's all.<br> It's not our heads.<br> It's our nerve we're losing.<br> Excuse me.<br> We're gonna do it right.<br> That's all I said.<br> It's the waiting<br> that's getting me.<br> It's getting me<br> just as bad, baby.<br> - But we've got to wait.<br> - Maybe we have, Walter, only...<br> it's so tough without you.<br> It's like a wall between us.<br> I better go, baby.<br> I'm thinking of you every minute.<br> After that, a full week went<br> by and I didn't see her once.<br> I tried to keep my mind off her<br> and off the whole idea.<br> I kept telling myself that maybe<br> those Fates they say watch over you...<br> had gotten together and broken his leg<br> to give me a way out.<br> Then it was the 15th of June.<br> You may remember that date, Keyes.<br> You came into my office<br> around 3.00 in the afternoon.<br> Hello, Keyes.<br> I just came<br> from Norton's office.<br> The semiannual sales<br> records are out.<br> You're high man, Walter.<br> That's twice in a row. Congratulations.<br> Thanks. How would you<br> like a cheap drink?<br> How would you like<br> a $50 cut in salary?<br> - Do I laugh now or wait till<br> it gets funny? - No, I'm serious.<br> I've just been talking to Norton.<br> Too much stuff piling up on my desk.<br> Too much pressure<br> on my nerves.<br> I spend half the night<br> walking up and down in my bed.<br> I've got to have an assistant<br> and I thought of you.<br> Me? Why pick on me?<br> Well, because I've got a crazy idea<br> you might be good at the job.<br> That's crazy, all right.<br> I'm a salesman.<br> Yeah. A peddler,<br> a gladhander, a backslapper.<br> You're too good<br> to be a salesman.<br> - Nobody's too good to be a salesman.<br> - Phooey!<br> All you guys do is just ring doorbells<br> and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk.<br> What's troubling you<br> is that $50 cut, isn't it?<br> - Well, that'd trouble anybody.<br> - Now look, Walter.<br> The job I'm talking about<br> takes brains and integrity.<br> It takes more guts than<br> there is in 50 salesmen.<br> It's the hottest job<br> in the business.<br> Yeah, but it's still<br> a desk job.<br> - I don't want to be nailed to a desk.<br> - Desk job?<br> Is that all you can see in it?<br> Just a hard chair to park your pants on<br> from 9:00 to 5:00, huh?<br> Just a pile of papers to shuffle around,<br> and five sharp pencils...<br> and a scratch pad to make figures on,<br> maybe a little doodling on the side.<br> Well, that's not the way<br> I look at it, Walter.<br> To me, a claims man is a surgeon,<br> that desk is an operating table...<br> and those pencils are scalpels<br> and bone chisels.<br> And those papers are not just forms and<br> statistics and claims for compensation.<br> They're alive.<br> They're packed with drama...<br> with twisted hopes<br> and crooked dreams.<br> A claims man, Walter,<br> is a doctor and a bloodhound and a...<br> Who? Okay, hold on a minute.<br> A claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound<br> and a cop and a judge and a jury...<br> and a father confessor,<br> all in one.<br> And you want to tell me<br> you're not interested?<br> You don't want to work<br> with your brains?<br> All you want to work is with<br> your finger on the doorbell...<br> for a few bucks more a week.<br> There's a dame on your phone.<br> - Walter Neff speaking.<br> - I had to call you, Walter.<br> It's very urgent.<br> Are you with somebody?<br> Yes, I am.<br> Can't I call you back, Margie?<br> No, you can't.<br> I've only got a minute. It can't wait.<br> Listen. He's going tonight. On the train.<br> Are you listening?<br> - Walter?<br> - Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.<br> - Only, make it snappy, will you?<br> - He's on crutches.<br> The doctor says he can go if he's<br> careful. The change will do him good.<br> It's wonderful, Walter.<br> Just the way you wanted it, on a train.<br> Only with the crutches<br> it makes it much better, doesn't it?<br> Yeah. Yeah,<br> that's 100% better.<br> Hold the line a minute,<br> will you?<br> - Keyes, suppose I join you in your office?<br> - That's all right. I'll wait.<br> Only tell her<br> not to take all day.<br> Go ahead.<br> It's the 10:15 from Glendale.<br> I'm driving him.<br> It's still the same<br> dark street, isn't it?<br> And the signal is three honks<br> on the horn. Okay. Anything else?<br> No.<br> Oh, uh...<br> what color did you pick?<br> Blue. Navy blue.<br> And the cast is on his left leg.<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Yeah, that suits me fine.<br> This is it, Walter.<br> I'm shaking like a leaf.<br> But it's straight down the line<br> for both of us.<br> I love you, Walter. Goodbye.<br> - Sorry, Keyes.<br> - What's the matter?<br> Dames chasing you again? Or still?<br> Or is it none of my business?<br> If I told you<br> it was a customer...<br> Margie. I bet she drinks<br> from the bottle.<br> Why don't you settle down<br> and get married, Walter?<br> - Why don't you, for instance?<br> - I almost did, once. Long time ago.<br> Now look, Keyes,<br> I've got to call on a prospect.<br> Even had the church<br> picked out, the dame and I.<br> She had a white satin dress<br> with flounces on it.<br> I was on my way to the jewelry store<br> to buy the ring.<br> And then suddenly that little man<br> in here started working on me.<br> So you went back<br> and had her investigated?<br> Yeah. And the stuff<br> that came out...<br> She'd been dyeing her hair<br> ever since she was 16.<br> There was a manic depressive<br> in her family, on her mother's side.<br> She already had one husband.<br> He was a professional<br> pool player in Baltimore.<br> - And as for her brother...<br> - I get the general idea.<br> - She was a tramp from a long line<br> of tramps. - Yeah. All right, all right.<br> Now what do I say to Norton?<br> What about this job I want you for?<br> I don't think<br> I want it, Keyes.<br> - Thanks just the same.<br> - Fair enough.<br> Only get this,<br> I picked you for the job...<br> not because I think<br> you're so darn smart...<br> but because I thought you were a shade<br> less dumb than the rest of the outfit.<br> Guess I was wrong.<br> You're not smarter, Walter.<br> You're just a little taller.<br> Yes, Keyes.<br> Those Fates I was talking about<br> had only been stalling me off.<br> Now they had thrown the switch.<br> The gears had meshed.<br> The time for thinking<br> had all run out.<br> I wanted my movements accounted for<br> up to the last possible moment.<br> So when I left the office I put my rate book<br> on the desk as if I had forgotten it.<br> That was part of my alibi.<br> From here on, it was a question<br> of following the timetable...<br> move by move.<br> I got home about 7.00 and<br> drove right into the garage.<br> This was another item<br> to establish my alibi.<br> - Hi, Mr. Neff.<br> - Hello, Charlie.<br> How about giving<br> the heap a wash job?<br> How soon you gonna want it?<br> I got a couple cars<br> ahead of you.<br> Any time you get<br> to it, Charlie.<br> - I'm staying in tonight.<br> - Okay.<br> Up in my apartment<br> I called Lou Schwartz...<br> one of the salesmen<br> that shared my office.<br> He lived in Westwood, so it was a toll call<br> and there'd be a record of it.<br> I told him I'd forgotten my rate book<br> and needed some dope...<br> on the public liability bond<br> I was figuring.<br> I changed into a navy blue suit like<br> Dietrichson was going to wear.<br> Lou Schwartz called me back<br> and gave me a lot of figures.<br> I stuffed a hand towel and<br> a roll of adhesive into my pockets...<br> so I could fake something that<br> looked like a cast on a broken leg.<br> Next, I stuck a card<br> inside the telephone box...<br> so that it would fall down<br> if the bell rang.<br> That way I'd know if anybody had<br> called me while I was away.<br> Then I did the same thing to the doorbell<br> in case anybody came to see me.<br> I left the apartment<br> by the service stairs. Nobody saw me.<br> I walked all the way from my apartment<br> to the Dietrichson house.<br> I didn't want<br> to take the bus...<br> because there was always the chance that<br> someone might remember seeing me on it.<br> I was being that careful.<br> I could smell that<br> honeysuckle again.<br> Only it was even stronger,<br> now that it was night.<br> I slid the garage door open<br> as quietly as I could.<br> She'd backed the sedan in,<br> just the way I told her to.<br> I'd figured it was<br> safer that way...<br> in case he got into the car<br> before she drove it out.<br> I got into<br> the back of the car.<br> I lay there on the floor<br> and waited.<br> All the time I was thinking about that<br> dark street on the way to the station...<br> where I was to do it...<br> and the three honks on the horn<br> that were to be the signal.<br> About 10 minutes later<br> they came down.<br> - All right, honey?<br> - Yeah, I'm all right.<br> I'll have the car out<br> in a second.<br> - Take it easy, honey.<br> We've got lots of time. - Yeah.<br> Remember what the doctor said.<br> If you get careless...<br> you might end up<br> with a shorter leg.<br> So what? I could break<br> the other one and match them up again.<br> It makes you feel pretty good<br> to get away from me, doesn't it?<br> It's only for four days.<br> I'll be back Monday at the latest.<br> This is not the right street.<br> Why did you turn here?<br> What are you doing that for?<br> What are you<br> honking the horn for?<br> You take care of the redcap<br> and the conductor.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - Keep away from me as much as you can.<br> - Tell them I don't want to be helped.<br> - I said, don't worry, Walter.<br> You start as soon as<br> the train leaves.<br> When you get to the refinery,<br> turn off the highway onto the dirt road.<br> From there it's exactly<br> eight-tenths of a mile...<br> to the dump beside the tracks.<br> Remember.<br> - I remember everything.<br> - No speeding.<br> You don't want any cops stopping you<br> with him in the back.<br> Walter, we've been through<br> all that so many times.<br> When you leave the highway,<br> turn off all your lights.<br> I'll be back on<br> the observation platform.<br> I'll drop off as close to<br> the spot as I can.<br> Let the train pass,<br> then dim your lights twice.<br> - San Francisco train, lady?<br> - Car 9, section 11. Just my husband.<br> Car 9, section 11?<br> This way please.<br> Thank you. My husband<br> doesn't like to be helped.<br> Car number 8. Up there.<br> Car 9, section 11. Thank you.<br> - Here're the tickets. - Take good<br> care of yourself with that leg.<br> Yeah. You take it easy<br> driving home.<br> - I'll miss you, honey.<br> - Section 11, sir.<br> - All aboard!<br> - Thank you.<br> - Goodbye, honey.<br> - All aboard!<br> Good luck, honey.<br> Porter, will you make up<br> my berth right away?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm going back to<br> the observation car for a smoke.<br> Right this way, sir.<br> Like a chair?<br> No, thanks. I'd rather stand.<br> - You going far?<br> - Palo Alto.<br> My name's Jackson.<br> I'm going all the way<br> to Medford. Medford, Oregon.<br> I had a broken arm once.<br> That darn cast itches<br> something fierce, doesn't it?<br> I thought I'd go crazy<br> with mine.<br> Palo Alto's a nice little town.<br> You a Stanford man?<br> - I used to be. - I'll bet you<br> left something behind.<br> I always do.<br> My cigar case. I guess I left it<br> in my overcoat back in the section.<br> Would you care to roll<br> yourself a cigarette, Mister...<br> Dietrichson.<br> No thanks,<br> I really prefer a cigar.<br> - Maybe the porter could...<br> - Well, I could get your cigars for you.<br> - Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.<br> - If it's not too much trouble.<br> - Car 9, section 11.<br> - Car 9, section 11. With pleasure.<br> Okay. This has gotta be fast.<br> Here, take his hat.<br> Pick up the crutches back on the tracks.<br> Okay, baby. That's it.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> On the way back,<br> we went over once more...<br> what she was to do<br> at the inquest...<br> if they had one, and about the insurance,<br> when that came up.<br> I was afraid she might go to pieces<br> a little, now that we had done it.<br> But she was perfect. No nerves.<br> Not a tear, not even a blink of the eyes.<br> She dropped me a block<br> from my apartment house.<br> Walter, what's the matter?<br> Aren't you going to kiss me?<br> It's straight down the line,<br> isn't it?<br> - I love you, Walter.<br> - I love you, baby.<br> It was two minutes past 11.00,<br> as I went up the service stairs again.<br> Nobody saw me this time either.<br> In the apartment I checked the bells.<br> The cards hadn't moved.<br> No calls. No visitors.<br> Then I changed my clothes again.<br> That left one last thing to do.<br> I had to go down to the garage.<br> I wanted Charlie to see me again.<br> You gonna use your car, after all?<br> I'm not quite through.<br> Well, that's all right,<br> Charlie.<br> Just going up to the drugstore<br> to get something to eat.<br> Been working upstairs all night.<br> My stomach's getting a little sore at me.<br> Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.<br> That was all there was to it.<br> Nothing had slipped,<br> nothing had been overlooked.<br> There was nothing<br> to give us away.<br> And yet, Keyes, as I was walking down<br> the street to the drugstore...<br> suddenly it came over me that<br> everything would go wrong.<br> It sounds crazy, Keyes,<br> but it's true, so help me.<br> I couldn't hear<br> my own footsteps.<br> It was the walk of a dead man.<br> That was the longest night<br> I ever lived through, Keyes...<br> and the next day was worse,<br> when the story had broke in the papers...<br> and they started talking<br> about it at the office...<br> and the day after that,<br> when you started digging into it.<br> I kept my hands in my pockets because<br> I thought they were shaking.<br> I put on dark glasses<br> so people couldn't see my eyes.<br> And then I took them off again so they<br> wouldn't get to wondering why I wore them.<br> I tried to<br> hold myself together, but...<br> I could feel my nerves<br> pulling me to pieces.<br> - Oh, Walter?<br> - Hello, Keyes.<br> Come along. The big boss<br> wants to see us.<br> - The Dietrichson case?<br> - Must be.<br> - Anything wrong?<br> - Well, the guy is dead.<br> We had him insured and it's gonna<br> cost us dough. That's always wrong.<br> - What have they got so far?<br> - Autopsy report.<br> No heart failure, no apoplexy,<br> no predisposing medical cause of any kind.<br> Died of a broken neck.<br> - When's the inquest?<br> - Had it this morning.<br> His wife and daughter<br> made the identification.<br> The train people and some of<br> the passengers told how he went through...<br> to the observation car.<br> It was all over in 45 minutes.<br> Verdict? Accidental death.<br> What do the police figure?<br> That he got tangled up<br> in his crutches and fell off the train.<br> They're satisfied.<br> It's not their dough.<br> Come on, Walter.<br> All right. Thank you<br> very much, gentlemen.<br> I believe the legal position<br> is now clear.<br> Please stand by.<br> I may need you later.<br> Come in, Mr. Keyes.<br> You, too, Mr. Neff.<br> You find this an uncomfortably<br> warm day, Mr. Keyes?<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Norton,<br> but I didn't know this was formal.<br> - Sit down, gentlemen.<br> - Thank you.<br> Any new developments?<br> I just talked to this Jackson<br> long distance, up in Medford, Oregon.<br> Who's Jackson?<br> He's the last man who saw<br> Dietrichson alive.<br> They were out on the<br> observation platform together, talking.<br> Dietrichson wanted a cigar<br> and so Jackson went back...<br> to get Dietrichson's<br> cigar case for him.<br> When he returned to the<br> observation platform, no Dietrichson.<br> Well, Jackson didn't think<br> anything was wrong until...<br> a wire caught up with<br> the train at Santa Barbara.<br> They found Dietrichson's body<br> on the tracks near Burbank.<br> Very interesting about<br> the cigar case.<br> Anything else?<br> No, not much.<br> Dietrichson's secretary says she<br> didn't know anything about the policy.<br> There's a daughter, but all she remembers<br> is Neff talking to her father...<br> about accident insurance<br> at their house one night.<br> I couldn't sell him at first.<br> Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.<br> He said he'd think it over.<br> Later I saw him<br> in the oil fields and closed him.<br> He signed the application<br> and gave me his check.<br> A fine piece of salesmanship<br> that was, Mr. Neff.<br> Well, there's no sense in<br> pushing Neff around.<br> He's got the best<br> sales record in the office.<br> Are your salesmen supposed to know<br> a customer is going to fall off the train?<br> Fall off a train? Are we sure<br> Dietrichson fell off the train?<br> - I don't get it.<br> - You don't, Mr. Keyes?<br> Then what do you<br> think of this case?<br> This policy might cost us<br> a great deal of money.<br> As you know, it contains<br> a double indemnity clause.<br> Just what is your opinion?<br> - No opinion at all.<br> - Not even a hunch?<br> One of those interesting<br> little hunches of yours?<br> Nope. Not even a hunch.<br> I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes.<br> I've formed a very definite opinion.<br> I think I know. In fact, I know<br> I know what happened to Dietrichson.<br> - You know you know what?<br> - I know it was not an accident.<br> - What do you say to that?<br> - Me?<br> Well, you've got the ball.<br> Let's see you run with it.<br> There's a widespread feeling that<br> just because a man has a large office...<br> Yes? Have her come in, please.<br> There's a widespread<br> feeling that...<br> just because a man has a large office,<br> he must be an idiot.<br> I'm having a visitor,<br> if you don't mind.<br> No, no. I want you to stay<br> and watch me handle this.<br> Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> Thank you very much<br> for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> I assure you I appreciate it.<br> This is Mr. Keyes.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - And Mr. Neff.<br> - I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do?<br> - Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> May I extend our sympathy<br> in your bereavement?<br> I hesitated before asking you<br> to come here so soon after your loss.<br> But now that you're here I hope you won't<br> mind if I plunge straight into business?<br> You know why we asked<br> you to come, don't you?<br> No. All I know is that your secretary<br> made it sound very urgent.<br> Your husband had<br> an accident policy with this company.<br> Evidently you don't know that,<br> Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> No. I remember some talk at the house,<br> but he didn't seem to want it.<br> Your husband took the policy out<br> a few days later, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> You'll probably find the policy<br> among his personal effects.<br> His safe-deposit box<br> hasn't been opened yet.<br> It seems a tax examiner<br> has to be present.<br> Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,<br> I don't want you to think...<br> you're being subjected to<br> any questioning...<br> but there are a few things<br> we should like to know.<br> What sort of things?<br> We have the report of<br> the coroner's inquest.<br> Accidental death.<br> We are not entirely satisfied.<br> In fact,<br> we are not satisfied at all.<br> Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,<br> we suspect...<br> a suicide.<br> - I'm sorry. Would you like<br> a glass of water? - Please.<br> Thank you.<br> Had your husband been depressed<br> or moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?<br> Did he have financial worries,<br> for instance?<br> He was perfectly all right and<br> I don't know of any financial worries.<br> Let us examine this<br> so-called accident.<br> First, your husband takes out this<br> policy in absolute secrecy. Why?<br> Because he doesn't want his family<br> to suspect what he intends to do.<br> - Do what? - Next, he goes<br> on this trip entirely alone.<br> He has to be alone. He hobbles all the<br> way out to the observation platform.<br> Very unlikely with his leg in a cast,<br> unless he has a very strong reason.<br> Once there, he finds he is not alone.<br> There is a man there.<br> - What was his name, Keyes?<br> - His name was Jackson. Probably still is.<br> So he gets rid of this Jackson<br> with some flimsy excuse about cigars.<br> - And then he is alone.<br> And then he does it. - Does what?<br> He jumps. Suicide. In which case,<br> the company is not liable.<br> You know that, of course.<br> Now, we could go to court...<br> I don't know anything. In fact,<br> I don't know why I came here.<br> Just a moment, please. I said we could<br> go to court. I didn't say we want to.<br> What I want to suggest is<br> a compromise on both sides.<br> A settlement for a certain sum,<br> a part of the policy value.<br> Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in<br> here, I had no idea you owed me any money.<br> You told me you did.<br> Then you told me you didn't.<br> Now you tell me you want to<br> pay me a part of it, whatever it is.<br> You want to bargain with me,<br> at a time like this.<br> I don't like your insinuations about my<br> husband, and I don't like your methods.<br> In fact, I don't like you, Mr. Norton.<br> Goodbye, gentlemen.<br> Nice going, Mr. Norton.<br> You sure carried that ball.<br> Only you fumbled<br> on the goal line.<br> Then you heaved an illegal forward pass<br> and got thrown for a 40-yard loss.<br> Now you can't pick yourself up because<br> you haven't got a leg to stand on.<br> I haven't, eh? She can go to court<br> and we can prove it was suicide.<br> Oh, can we?<br> Mr. Norton, the first thing<br> that struck me was that suicide angle.<br> Only I dumped it into the wastepaper<br> basket just three seconds later.<br> You know, you ought to take a look<br> at the statistics on suicide sometime.<br> You might learn a little something<br> about the insurance business.<br> Mr. Keyes, I was raised<br> in the insurance business.<br> Yeah, in the front office.<br> Come now, you've never read<br> an actuarial table in your life, have you?<br> Why, they've got 10 volumes<br> on suicide alone.<br> Suicide by race, by color,<br> by occupation...<br> by sex, by seasons of the year,<br> by time of day.<br> Suicide, how committed? By poisons,<br> by firearms, by drowning, by leaps.<br> Suicide by poison,<br> subdivided by types of poison...<br> such as corrosive, irritant,<br> systemic, gaseous, narcotic...<br> alkaloid, protein,<br> and so forth.<br> Suicide by leaps, subdivided by<br> leaps from high places...<br> under the wheels of trains,<br> under the wheels of trucks...<br> under the feet of horses,<br> from steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...<br> of all the cases on record there's not<br> one single case of suicide by leap...<br> from the rear end<br> of a moving train.<br> And do you know how fast<br> that train was going...<br> at the point where the body was found?<br> Now how can anybody jump off<br> a slow moving train like that...<br> with any kind of expectation<br> that he would kill himself?<br> No. No soap, Mr. Norton.<br> We're sunk, and we'll have to pay<br> through the nose, and you know it.<br> May I have this?<br> Come on, Walter.<br> Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.<br> I could have hugged you<br> right then and there, Keyes...<br> you and your statistics.<br> You were the only one<br> we were really scared of...<br> and instead you were<br> almost playing on our team.<br> That evening when I got home,<br> my nerves had eased off.<br> I could feel the ground<br> under my feet again.<br> And it looked like easy going<br> from there on in.<br> That $100,000 looked<br> as safe for Phyllis and me...<br> as if we had the check<br> already deposited in the bank.<br> Hello? Oh, hello, baby.<br> Sure, everything is fine.<br> You were wonderful<br> in Norton's office.<br> I felt so funny, I wanted to<br> look at you all the time.<br> How do you think I felt, baby?<br> Where are you?<br> At the drugstore.<br> Just a block away.<br> - Can I come up?<br> - Okay. But be careful.<br> Don't let anybody see you.<br> Hello, Keyes.<br> - What's on your mind?<br> - That broken leg.<br> - The guy had a broken leg.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Talking about Dietrichson. He<br> had accident insurance, didn't he?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Then he broke his leg, didn't he?<br> - So what?<br> - And he didn't put in a claim.<br> - Why didn't he put in a claim? Why?<br> - What are you driving at?<br> Walter, I had dinner two hours<br> ago and it stuck half way.<br> That little man of yours<br> is acting up again, huh?<br> There's something wrong<br> with the Dietrichson case.<br> Why? Because he didn't file a claim?<br> Maybe he just didn't have time.<br> Maybe he just didn't know<br> that he was insured.<br> No. No, that couldn't be it.<br> You delivered the policy<br> to him personally, didn't you?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You got his check?<br> Sure I did.<br> - Got any bicarbonate of soda?<br> - No, I haven't.<br> Walter, I've been living with<br> this little man for 26 years.<br> And he's never failed me yet.<br> There's got to be something wrong.<br> Well, maybe Norton was right.<br> Maybe it was suicide.<br> No. Not suicide.<br> - But not an accident, either.<br> - What else?<br> Now look, Walter.<br> A guy takes out an accident<br> policy that's worth $100,000...<br> if he's killed on a train.<br> Then two weeks later,<br> he is killed on a train.<br> And not in a train accident, mind you,<br> but falling off some silly observation car.<br> Do you know what the mathematical<br> probability of that is?<br> One out of I don't know<br> how many billions.<br> And add to that the broken leg.<br> No, it just can't be the way it looks.<br> - Something has been worked on us.<br> - Such as what?<br> Murder?<br> Don't you have any peppermint<br> or something?<br> - Sorry. Want a little soda water?<br> - No, no, no.<br> Who do you suspect?<br> Maybe I like to<br> make things easy for myself.<br> But I always tend to suspect<br> the beneficiary.<br> - You mean the wife?<br> - Yeah.<br> That wide-eyed dame that just<br> didn't know anything about anything.<br> You're crazy, Keyes.<br> She wasn't even on the train.<br> I know she wasn't, Walter.<br> I don't claim to know how it<br> was worked, or who worked it...<br> but all I know is that<br> it was worked.<br> I've got to<br> get to a drugstore.<br> This thing feels like<br> a hunk of concrete inside me.<br> - Good night, Walter.<br> - Good night, Keyes.<br> - See you at the office in the morning.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'd like to move in on her<br> right now, tonight.<br> If it wasn't for Norton and his<br> striped-pants ideas about company policy...<br> I'd have the police after her<br> so fast it'd make her head spin.<br> They'd put her<br> through the wringer...<br> and, brother, the things<br> they would squeeze out.<br> Only you haven't got a<br> single thing to go on, Keyes.<br> Oh, not too much.<br> Just 26 years experience...<br> all the percentage there is, and<br> this hunk of concrete in my stomach.<br> Can I have<br> one of those things?<br> - Good night, Keyes.<br> - So long, Walter.<br> - How much does he know?<br> - He doesn't know anything.<br> It's those stinking<br> hunches of his.<br> And he can't prove anything,<br> can he?<br> Not if we're careful. Not if we<br> don't see each other for a while.<br> - How long a while?<br> - Until this dies down.<br> You don't know Keyes.<br> Once he gets his teeth into<br> something, he never lets go.<br> He'll investigate you,<br> have you shadowed.<br> He'll watch you<br> every minute from now on.<br> - You afraid, baby?<br> - Yes, I'm afraid.<br> But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of us.<br> We're not the same anymore.<br> We did it so we could be together, but<br> instead of that it's pulling us apart.<br> - Isn't it, Walter?<br> - What are you talking about?<br> And you don't really care<br> whether we see each other or not.<br> Shut up, baby.<br> Pacific All Risk.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Hello, Mr. Neff.<br> - Hello.<br> - Lola Dietrichson.<br> - Don't you remember me?<br> - Yes. Yes, of course.<br> Could I talk with you<br> just a few minutes?<br> Somewhere where<br> we could be alone?<br> Oh, yes. Come into my office.<br> Is it something about<br> what happened?<br> Yes, Mr. Neff.<br> It's about my father's death.<br> I'm terribly sorry,<br> Miss Dietrichson.<br> Lou, do you mind if I use the office<br> alone for a few minutes?<br> No. It's all yours, Walter.<br> Look at me, Mr. Neff.<br> I'm not crazy. I'm not hysterical.<br> I'm not even crying.<br> But I have the awful feeling<br> that something's wrong...<br> and I had that same feeling<br> once before, when my mother died.<br> When your mother died?<br> We were at Lake Arrowhead.<br> That was six years ago.<br> We had a cabin there.<br> It was winter and very cold.<br> My mother was very sick with pneumonia.<br> She had a nurse with her.<br> There were just<br> the three of us in the cabin.<br> One night I got up<br> and went into my mother's room.<br> She was delirious with fever.<br> All the bed covers were on the floor<br> and the windows were wide open.<br> The nurse wasn't in the room.<br> I ran and covered my mother up<br> as quickly as I could.<br> Just then I heard<br> a door open behind me.<br> The nurse stood there.<br> She didn't say a word,<br> but there was a look in her eyes...<br> I'll never forget.<br> Two days later,<br> my mother was dead.<br> Do you know who<br> that nurse was?<br> - No. Who?<br> - Phyllis.<br> I tried to tell my father,<br> but I was just a kid then.<br> He wouldn't listen to me.<br> Six months later she married him...<br> and I kind of talked myself out of the idea<br> she could have done anything like that.<br> But now it's all back again, now that<br> something's happened to my father, too.<br> You're not making sense, Miss Dietrichson.<br> Your father fell off a train.<br> Yes, and two days before he fell off<br> that train, what was Phyllis doing?<br> She was in her room in front of<br> a mirror, with a black hat on...<br> pinning a black veil to it.<br> As if she couldn't wait to see<br> how she would look in mourning.<br> You've had a pretty bad shock,<br> Miss Dietrichson.<br> Aren't you just<br> imagining these things?<br> I caught her eyes<br> in the mirror.<br> They had that look in them<br> they had before my mother died.<br> That same look.<br> You don't like<br> your stepmother, do you?<br> Isn't it just because<br> she is your stepmother?<br> I loathe her because she did it.<br> She did it for the money.<br> Only you're not going to<br> pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?<br> She's not going to get away with it<br> this time, because I'm going to speak up.<br> I'm going to<br> tell everything I know.<br> - You'd better be careful, saying things...<br> - I'm not afraid. You'll see.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to<br> act like this.<br> All this that you've been telling me,<br> who else have you told?<br> No one.<br> - How about your stepmother?<br> - Of course not.<br> I've moved out.<br> I'm not living<br> at home anymore.<br> And you haven't told that<br> boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?<br> I'm not seeing him anymore.<br> We had a fight.<br> Where are you living now?<br> I got myself a little<br> apartment in Hollywood.<br> Four walls, and you just sit<br> and look at them?<br> Yes, Mr. Neff.<br> So that evening<br> I took her to dinner...<br> at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera<br> Street where nobody would see us.<br> I wanted to cheer her up.<br> The next day was Sunday and we went<br> for a ride down to the beach.<br> She had loosened up a bit,<br> she was even laughing.<br> I had to make sure that she wouldn't tell<br> that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else.<br> It was dynamite,<br> whether it was true or not.<br> And I had no chance<br> to talk to Phyllis.<br> You were watching her<br> like a hawk, Keyes.<br> I couldn't even phone her because I<br> was afraid you had the wires tapped.<br> Monday morning there was a note on my<br> desk that you wanted to see me, Keyes.<br> For a minute I wondered<br> if it could be about Lola.<br> It was worse.<br> Outside your door was the last guy<br> in the world I wanted to see.<br> Come in. Come in, Walter.<br> - Hello, Keyes.<br> - I want to ask you something.<br> After all the years<br> we've known each other...<br> do you mind if I make<br> a rather blunt statement?<br> - About what?<br> - About me.<br> - Walter, I'm a very great man.<br> - Yeah?<br> This Dietrichson business,<br> it's murder...<br> and murders don't come<br> any neater.<br> As fancy a piece of homicide<br> as anybody ever ran into...<br> smart, tricky,<br> almost perfect, but...<br> I think Papa has it<br> all figured out.<br> Figured out and wrapped up in<br> tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.<br> - Go ahead. I'm listening.<br> - You know what?<br> That guy Dietrichson<br> was never on the train.<br> - He wasn't?<br> - No, he wasn't.<br> Now look, Walter.<br> You can't be sure of killing a man...<br> by throwing him off a train<br> that's going 15 miles an hour.<br> The only way you can be sure<br> is to kill him first...<br> and then throw<br> his body on the tracks.<br> Now that would mean<br> either killing him on the train...<br> or, and this is where it really gets<br> fancy, you kill him somewhere else...<br> and put him on the tracks.<br> Two possibilities,<br> and I personally buy the second.<br> You're way ahead of me,<br> Keyes.<br> Well, look, Walter,<br> it was like this.<br> They killed the guy, the wife<br> and a somebody else...<br> and the somebody else took the crutches<br> and went on the train as Dietrichson...<br> then the somebody<br> else jumped off...<br> then they put the body on the tracks<br> where the train had passed.<br> An impersonation, see?<br> A cinch to work.<br> Because it was night,<br> very few people were about...<br> they have the crutches<br> to stare at...<br> they never really looked<br> at the man at all.<br> Fancy all right, Keyes,<br> but maybe it's a little too fancy.<br> Is it? I tell you, it all<br> fits together like a watch.<br> Now let's see what we have<br> in the way of proof.<br> The only guy who really got a good look<br> at this supposed Dietrichson...<br> is sitting<br> right outside my office.<br> I took the trouble to bring<br> him down here from Oregon.<br> - Come here, Mr. Jackson.<br> - Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.<br> These are fine cigars<br> you smoke.<br> - Two for a quarter.<br> - That's what I said.<br> Well, did you study<br> those photographs?<br> Yes, indeed.<br> I studied them thoroughly.<br> - Very thoroughly.<br> - Have you made up your mind?<br> Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford man.<br> Medford, Oregon.<br> Up in Medford we take our time<br> making up our mind.<br> Well, we're not in Medford now.<br> We're in a hurry. Let's have it.<br> Are these photographs<br> of the late Mr. Dietrichson?<br> Yes.<br> - Then my answer is no.<br> - What do you mean, no?<br> I mean, this is not<br> the man that was on the train.<br> Will you swear to that?<br> Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.<br> Medford, Oregon.<br> If I say it, I mean it.<br> If I mean it, of course I'll swear it.<br> There you are, Walter.<br> There's your proof.<br> This is Mr. Neff,<br> one of our salesmen.<br> - Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.<br> - Pleased, indeed.<br> - How are you?<br> - Very fine, thank you.<br> - Never was better.<br> - Sit down, Mr. Jackson.<br> Just how would you describe the man<br> you saw on the observation platform?<br> Well, I'm pretty sure<br> he was a younger man...<br> about 10 or 15 years younger<br> than the man in these photographs.<br> Dietrichson was about 50,<br> wasn't he, Walter?<br> Fifty-one,<br> according to the policy.<br> The man I saw was nothing like<br> Of course, it was pretty dark<br> out on that platform.<br> Come to think of it,<br> he tried to keep his back towards me.<br> - But I'm positive just the same.<br> - Thank you, Jackson.<br> Of course, you understand<br> this matter is strictly confidential?<br> We may need you again down here in<br> Los Angeles, if the case comes to court.<br> Any time you need me, I'm entirely<br> at your disposal, gentlemen.<br> - Expenses paid, of course.<br> - Oh, yes. Yes. Of course.<br> Get me Lubin,<br> in the cashier's office.<br> Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.<br> Listen. I'm sending a man named Jackson<br> down to you with an expense account.<br> Well, we brought him down here from<br> Medford, Oregon in connection with...<br> the Dietrichson claim.<br> Well, take care of his<br> hotel bill, will you?<br> Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?<br> Yeah. He'll be right down.<br> No. Never been up there.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You go trout fishing?<br> - Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way.<br> - Nope. I don't fish.<br> You don't go fishing,<br> Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.<br> - There's a family of Neffs<br> in Corvallis. - No relation.<br> Let me see. This man's<br> an automobile dealer in Corvallis.<br> - A very reputable man, too, I'm told.<br> - All right, Mr. Jackson.<br> Suppose you go down to<br> the cashier's office.<br> Room 27 on the 11th floor.<br> He'll take care of your expense account<br> and your ticket for the train tonight.<br> Tonight?<br> Tomorrow morning would suit me better.<br> There's a very good osteopath in town...<br> - I'd like to see before I leave.<br> - Osteopath?<br> Well, just don't put her<br> on the expense account.<br> Well, goodbye, gentlemen.<br> - It's been a pleasure.<br> - Goodbye.<br> There it is, Walter. It's beginning<br> to come apart at the seams already.<br> Murder's never perfect.<br> Always comes apart sooner or later.<br> And when two people are involved,<br> it's usually sooner.<br> Now, we know the Dietrichson dame<br> is in it, and a somebody else.<br> Pretty soon we'll know<br> who that somebody else is.<br> He'll show. He's got to show.<br> Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet.<br> Their emotions<br> are all kicked up.<br> Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter.<br> They can't keep away from each other.<br> They may think it's twice as safe<br> because there are two of them.<br> But it isn't twice as safe.<br> It's 10 times twice as dangerous.<br> They've committed a murder...<br> and it's not like taking<br> a trolley ride together...<br> where they can get off<br> at different stops.<br> They're stuck with each other<br> and they've got to ride...<br> all the way to<br> the end of the line.<br> And it's a one-way trip,<br> and the last stop is the cemetery.<br> She put in her claim.<br> I'm gonna throw it<br> right back at her.<br> Let her sue us if she dares.<br> I'll be ready for her<br> and that somebody else.<br> They'll be digging<br> their own graves.<br> Mrs. Dietrichson?<br> This is Jerry's Market.<br> We just got in a shipment of that<br> English soap you were asking about.<br> Will you be coming by today?<br> Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> - Hello, Walter.<br> - Come over here.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Everything's the matter.<br> Keyes is rejecting your claim.<br> He's sitting back with his<br> mouth watering, waiting for you to sue.<br> He wants you to sue,<br> but you're not going to.<br> - What's he got to stop me?<br> - He's got plenty.<br> He's figured out how<br> it was worked.<br> He knows it was somebody else<br> on the train...<br> and he's dug up a witness<br> he thinks can prove it.<br> Prove it how? If he rejects<br> that claim, I have to sue.<br> Yeah? And then you're in court and a lot<br> of other things are going to come up.<br> Like, for instance, about you<br> and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.<br> What about me and<br> the first Mrs. Dietrichson?<br> The way she died.<br> And about that black hat you were<br> trying on before you needed a black hat.<br> Lola's been telling you<br> some of her cockeyed stories.<br> - She's been seeing you. - I've been<br> seeing her, if you want to know.<br> So she won't yell her head off<br> about what she knows.<br> She's putting on an act for you,<br> crying all over your shoulder, the lying...<br> Keep her out of this. All I'm telling you<br> is we're not going to sue.<br> Because you don't want<br> the money anymore...<br> even if you could have it,<br> because she's...<br> made you feel like<br> a heel all of a sudden?<br> It isn't the money anymore. It's our necks.<br> We're pulling out, do you understand?<br> Because of what Keyes can do?<br> You're not fooling me, Walter.<br> It's because of Lola,<br> what you did to her father.<br> You're afraid she might find out someday<br> and you can't take it, can you?<br> I said, leave her out of this.<br> It's me I'm talking about.<br> - I don't want to be left out of it.<br> - Stop saying that.<br> It's just that it<br> hasn't worked as we wanted.<br> - We can't go through with it, that's all.<br> - We have gone through with it.<br> The tough part<br> is all behind us.<br> We just have to hold on now<br> and not go soft inside...<br> stick close together<br> the way we started out.<br> Watch it.<br> I loved you, Walter,<br> and I hated him.<br> But I wasn't going to do anything<br> about it, not until I met you.<br> You planned the whole thing.<br> I only wanted him dead.<br> And I'm the one that<br> fixed it so he was dead.<br> - Is that what you're telling me?<br> - And nobody's pulling out.<br> We went into this together,<br> we're coming out at the end together.<br> It's straight down the line<br> for both of us, remember?<br> Yes, I remembered.<br> Just like I remembered<br> what you had told me, Keyes...<br> about that trolley car ride...<br> and how there was no getting off<br> till the end of the line...<br> ...where the cemetery was.<br> And then I got to thinking<br> what cemeteries are for.<br> They're to put dead people in.<br> I guess that was the first time<br> I ever thought about Phyllis that way.<br> Dead, I mean.<br> And how it would be<br> if she were dead.<br> I saw Lola three or four times<br> that week.<br> One night we went up into the hills<br> behind the Hollywood Bowl.<br> I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,<br> but it was only with her that...<br> I could relax<br> and let go a little.<br> Why are you crying?<br> Not gonna tell me, huh?<br> Of course I will, Walter.<br> I wouldn't tell anybody else but you.<br> - It's about Nino.<br> - Zachetti? What about him?<br> They killed my father together.<br> He and Phyllis.<br> He helped her do it.<br> I know he did.<br> What makes you say that?<br> I've been following him. He's been<br> to her house, night after night.<br> It was Phyllis<br> and him all along.<br> Maybe he was just going with me as<br> a blind. And the night of the murder...<br> You promised me you weren't<br> gonna talk like this anymore.<br> He was supposed to pick me up<br> after a lecture at UCLA.<br> But he never showed up.<br> He said he was sick.<br> Sick!<br> He couldn't show up, because the train<br> was leaving with my father on it.<br> Maybe I'm just crazy.<br> Maybe it's all in my mind.<br> Sure, it's all in your mind.<br> I only wish it were, Walter,<br> 'cause I still love him.<br> Zachetti.<br> Phyllis and Zachetti.<br> What was he doing up at her house?<br> I couldn't figure that one out.<br> I tried to make sense out of it<br> and got nowhere.<br> But the real braintwister<br> came the next day.<br> You sprang it on me, Keyes,<br> after office hours, when you caught me...<br> down in the lobby<br> of the building.<br> Walter. Walter, just a minute.<br> - Hello, Keyes.<br> - Just hang on to your hat, Walter.<br> - What for?<br> - Oh, nothing much.<br> That Dietrichson case<br> just busted wide open.<br> - How do you mean?<br> - The guy showed. That's how.<br> - What guy?<br> - The guy who helped her do it.<br> The somebody else?<br> - No kidding?<br> - Yeah. She just filed suit against us.<br> It's okay by me.<br> When we get them in that courtroom,<br> I'll tear them to pieces, both of them.<br> - Come on. I'll buy you a martini, Walter.<br> - No thanks, Keyes.<br> With two olives.<br> No, I've got to get a shave<br> and a shoeshine. I've got a date.<br> Margie. I still bet she drinks<br> from the bottle.<br> They give you matches<br> when you buy cigars, you know.<br> All you have to do is<br> ask for them.<br> Don't like them, they always explode<br> in my pocket. So long, Walter.<br> I was scared stiff, Keyes.<br> Maybe you were playing<br> cat-and-mouse with me.<br> Maybe you knew all along<br> I was the somebody else.<br> I had to find out, and I knew<br> where to look. In your office.<br> Memo to Mr. Norton.<br> Confidential.<br> Dietrichson file.<br> With regard to your proposal<br> to put Walter Neff under surveillance...<br> I disagree absolutely.<br> I have investigated his<br> movements on the night of the crime...<br> and he's definitely placed<br> in his apartment from 7.15 p.m. on.<br> In addition to this, I have known<br> Neff intimately for 11 years...<br> and I personally vouch for him<br> without reservation.<br> Furthermore, no connection whatsoever<br> has been established...<br> between Walter Neff and<br> Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...<br> whereas I am now able to report that<br> such a connection has been established...<br> between her and another man.<br> This man has been observed<br> to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...<br> on the nights of July 9th,<br> 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.<br> We have succeeded in<br> identifying him as one Nino Zachetti...<br> former medical student,<br> age of 28...<br> residing at<br> Lilac Court Apartments...<br> 12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.<br> We have checked Zachetti's movements<br> on the night of the crime...<br> and have found that<br> they cannot be accounted for.<br> I am preparing a more detailed report<br> for your consideration.<br> It is my belief that we already have<br> sufficient evidence against Zachetti...<br> and Mrs. Dietrichson<br> to justify police action.<br> I strongly urge that this whole matter<br> be turned over to the office...<br> of the district attorney.<br> Respectfully, Barton Keyes.<br> Phyllis? It's Walter.<br> I've got to see you. Tonight.<br> Yes, it has to be tonight.<br> How's 11:00?<br> Don't worry about Keyes.<br> Just leave the front door unlocked<br> and put the lights out.<br> No, nobody's watching<br> the house. Not anymore.<br> It's just for the neighbors.<br> I told you not to worry about Keyes.<br> I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.<br> Goodbye, baby.<br> I guess I don't have to<br> tell you...<br> what I intended to do<br> at 11.00, Keyes.<br> For the first time, I saw a way to get<br> clear of the whole mess I was in...<br> and of Phyllis, too,<br> all at the same time.<br> Yeah, that's what I thought.<br> What I didn't know was that<br> she had plans of her own.<br> In here, Walter.<br> Hello, baby.<br> - Anybody else in the house?<br> - Nobody. Why?<br> - What's that music?<br> - A radio up the street.<br> Just like the first time<br> I came here, isn't it?<br> We were talking about<br> automobile insurance.<br> Only you were thinking<br> about murder.<br> I was thinking about<br> that anklet.<br> And what are you<br> thinking about now?<br> I'm all through thinking,<br> baby.<br> - I just came to say goodbye.<br> - Goodbye?<br> - Where are you going? - You're<br> the one that's going, baby. Not me.<br> I'm getting off the trolley car<br> right at this corner.<br> Suppose you stop being fancy.<br> Let's have it, whatever it is.<br> All right, I'll tell you.<br> A friend of mine's got a funny theory.<br> He says when two people commit a murder,<br> it's sort of like they're riding...<br> on a trolley car together.<br> One can't get off without the other.<br> They're stuck with each other<br> and they have to go on...<br> riding together<br> clear to the end of the line.<br> And the last stop<br> is the cemetery.<br> - Maybe he's got something there.<br> - You bet he has.<br> Two people are gonna ride<br> to the end of the line, all right.<br> Only I'm not gonna be one of them. I've<br> got another guy to finish my ride for me.<br> - Just who are you talking about?<br> - An acquaintance of yours.<br> A Mr. Zachetti.<br> Come on, baby,<br> I just got into this thing...<br> because I happen to know a little<br> something about insurance, didn't I?<br> I was a sucker.<br> I'd have been brushed off just as soon<br> as you got your hands on the money.<br> - Nobody wanted to brush you off.<br> - Save it. I'm telling this.<br> It's been you and that<br> Zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?<br> That's not true.<br> Doesn't make any difference<br> if it's true or not.<br> The point is, Keyes believes Zachetti<br> is the one he's been looking for.<br> He'll have him in that gas chamber<br> before he knows what's happened to him.<br> - What's happening to me all this time?<br> - Don't be silly, baby.<br> What do you think is gonna happen to you?<br> You helped him do the murder, didn't you?<br> That's what Keyes thinks.<br> And what's good enough<br> for Keyes is good enough for me.<br> Maybe it's not good enough for me,<br> Walter. Maybe I don't go for the idea.<br> Maybe I'd rather talk.<br> Sometimes people are where they can't<br> talk. Under six feet of dirt, maybe.<br> And if it was you, they'd charge that up<br> to Zachetti, too, wouldn't they?<br> Sure they would, and that's just<br> what's gonna happen, baby.<br> 'Cause he's coming here<br> tonight, in about 15 minutes.<br> With the cops right behind him.<br> It's all taken care of.<br> That would make everything<br> lovely for you, wouldn't it?<br> Right. And it's got to be done before<br> that suit of yours comes to trial...<br> and Lola gets a chance<br> to sound off...<br> before they trip you up on the stand, and<br> you start to go in drag me down with you.<br> Maybe I had Zachetti here so they<br> won't get a chance to trip me up...<br> so we can get the money<br> and be together.<br> - That's cute. Say it again. - He came<br> here first to ask where Lola was.<br> I made him come back.<br> I was working on him.<br> He's a crazy sort of guy,<br> quick-tempered.<br> I kept hammering into him<br> that she was with another man...<br> so he'd go into one of his jealous rages,<br> and then I'd tell him where she was.<br> And you know what he would've<br> done to her, don't you, Walter?<br> Yeah, and for once I believe you,<br> because it's just rotten enough.<br> We're both rotten.<br> Only you're<br> a little more rotten.<br> You got me to take care<br> of your husband for you...<br> and then you got Zachetti to take care<br> of Lola, maybe take care of me, too.<br> Then somebody else would have come along<br> to take care of Zachetti for you.<br> - That's the way you operate,<br> isn't it, baby? - Suppose it is.<br> Is what you've got cooked up<br> for tonight any better?<br> I don't like that music anymore.<br> Mind if I close the window?<br> You can do better than that,<br> can't you, baby?<br> Better try it again.<br> Maybe if I came<br> a little closer?<br> How's this?<br> Think you can do it now?<br> Why didn't you<br> shoot again, baby?<br> Don't tell me it's because you've been<br> in love with me all this time.<br> No, I never loved you, Walter,<br> not you or anybody else.<br> I'm rotten to the heart.<br> I used you, just as you said.<br> That's all you<br> ever meant to me...<br> until a minute ago...<br> when I couldn't fire<br> that second shot.<br> I never thought<br> that could happen to me.<br> - Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.<br> - I'm not asking you to buy.<br> Just hold me close.<br> Goodbye, baby.<br> Zachetti.<br> Come here.<br> I said, come here.<br> - My name is Neff.<br> - Yeah, and I still don't like it.<br> What do you want?<br> Look, kid.<br> I want to give you a present.<br> This nice new nickel.<br> - What's the gag?<br> - Suppose you go on back down the hill...<br> to the drugstore<br> and make a phone call.<br> Keep your nickel and buy yourself<br> an ice-cream cone.<br> The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.<br> Ask for Miss Dietrichson.<br> First name is Lola.<br> She isn't worth a nickel.<br> If I ever talk to her, it's not<br> going to be over any telephone.<br> Tough, aren't you?<br> Here, take the nickel<br> and call her. She wants you to.<br> She doesn't want<br> any part of me.<br> I know who told you that.<br> It's not true.<br> Lola's in love with you.<br> She always has been.<br> Don't ask me why.<br> I couldn't even guess.<br> Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.<br> Now go on and call her.<br> Go on. That way.<br> It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.<br> It's cold.<br> I wonder if she's still lying alone<br> up there in that house...<br> or if they've found her<br> by now.<br> I wonder a lot of things.<br> They don't matter anymore.<br> Except I want you to do<br> a favor for me, Keyes.<br> I want you to be the one to tell Lola,<br> kind of gently, before it breaks wide open.<br> And I want you to take care of her<br> and that guy Zachetti...<br> so he doesn't get<br> pushed around too much.<br> Hello, Keyes.<br> Up pretty early, aren't you?<br> I always wondered what time<br> you got down to the office.<br> Or did that little man of yours<br> pull you out of bed?<br> The janitor did.<br> Seems you leaked a little blood<br> on the way in here.<br> Yeah.<br> Wouldn't be surprised.<br> I wanted to straighten you out<br> on that Dietrichson case.<br> So I gather.<br> - How long have you been standing there?<br> - Long enough.<br> Kind of a crazy story<br> with a crazy twist to it.<br> One you didn't<br> quite figure out.<br> You can't figure them all,<br> Walter.<br> That's right.<br> I guess you can't at that.<br> Now I suppose<br> I get the big speech...<br> the one with all the<br> two-dollar words in it.<br> Let's have it, Keyes.<br> Walter, you're all washed up.<br> Thanks, Keyes.<br> That was short anyway.<br> I'm gonna call for a doctor.<br> What for?<br> So they can patch me up?<br> So they can nurse me along<br> till I get back on my feet?<br> So I can walk into that gas chamber up<br> at San Quentin on my own power?<br> Is that it, Keyes?<br> Something like that.<br> - I've got a different idea.<br> - Yeah?<br> Look, Keyes.<br> Suppose you went back to bed<br> and didn't find these cylinders...<br> till tomorrow morning,<br> when the office opens...<br> After that you can<br> play it any way you like.<br> Would you do<br> that much for me, Keyes?<br> - Give me one good reason. - I need<br> four hours to get where I'm going.<br> - You're not going anywhere, Walter.<br> - You bet I am.<br> - I'm going across the border.<br> - You haven't got a chance, Walter.<br> Good enough to try for.<br> - You'll never make the border.<br> - That's what you think.<br> Just watch me.<br> You'll never even make<br> the elevator.<br> So long, Keyes.<br> Hello...<br> send an ambulance to<br> the Pacific Building on Olive Street.<br> Yeah. It's a police job.<br> - How you doing, Walter?<br> - Fine.<br> Only somebody moved the elevator<br> a couple of miles away.<br> They're on the way.<br> You know why you couldn't<br> figure this one, Keyes?<br> I'll tell you.<br> Because the guy you were<br> looking for was too close.<br> He was right across<br> the desk from you.<br> Closer than that, Walter.<br> I love you, too.<br>
