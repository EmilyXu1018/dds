If they had teeth,<br> they would've bit you.<br> If my pants had teeth...<br> Doubt<br> Jimmy! Go to the store,<br> buy me the newspaper and cigarettes.<br> Can't. Serving mass. I'm an alter boy.<br> - Hey, Kevin!<br> - Hey, Jimmy!<br> - There you are.<br> - Overslept.<br> Well, you made it. I'll do the<br> cruets if you light the charcoal.<br> You think I'm fat?<br> You're alright. What? Clothes don't fit?<br> No, they fit.<br> You're gonna be going to the bakery<br> after mass.<br> - I am? Why don't you go?<br> - I'm gonna be making breakfast.<br> - I can make breakfast.<br> - When have you ever?<br> Funny man.<br> Good morning, Father.<br> Good morning, Father.<br> Be seated.<br> What do you do when you're not sure?<br> That's the topic of my sermon today.<br> Last year, when President Kennedy<br> was assassinated,<br> who among us did not experience<br> the most profound disorientation?<br> Despair?<br> Which way?<br> What now?<br> What do I say to my kids?<br> What do I tell myself?<br> It was a time of people sitting together,<br> bound together<br> by a common feeling of hopelessness.<br> But think of that!<br> Your BOND with your fellow<br> being was your Despair.<br> It was a public experience.<br> It was awful, but we were in it together.<br> How much worse is it then<br> for the lone man, the lone woman,<br> stricken by a private calamity?<br> "No one knows I'm sick."<br> "No one knows I've lost<br> my last real friend."<br> "No one knows I've done something wrong."<br> Imagine the isolation.<br> Now you see the world<br> as through a window.<br> On one side of the glass:<br> happy, untroubled people,<br> and on the other side: you.<br> - God Bless you, Sister.<br> - Thank you.<br> I want to tell you a story.<br> A cargo ship sank one night.<br> It caught fire and went down.<br> And only this one sailor survived.<br> He found a lifeboat, rigged a sail...<br> and being of a nautical discipline...<br> turned his eyes to the Heavens<br> and read the stars.<br> He set a course for his home,<br> and exhausted, fell asleep.<br> Clouds rolled in.<br> And for the next twenty nights,<br> he could no longer see the stars.<br> He thought he was on course,<br> but there was no way to be certain.<br> And as the days rolled on,<br> and the sailor wasted away,<br> he began to have doubts.<br> Had he set his course right?<br> Was he still going on towards his home?<br> Or was he horribly lost and doomed<br> to a terrible death?<br> No way to know.<br> The message of the constellations---<br> had he imagined it because of his<br> desperate circumstance?<br> Or had he seen truth once...<br> Straighten. Up.<br> and now had to hold on to it<br> without further reassurance?<br> There are those of you in church today<br> who know exactly the crisis of faith<br> I describe.<br> And I want to say to you:<br> Doubt can be a bond as powerful<br> and sustaining as certainty.<br> When you are lost, you are not alone.<br> In the name of the Father, the Son,<br> and the Holy Ghost. Amen.<br> Please rise.<br> - Hey, Father.<br> - Hey, Champ.<br> That was some sermon.<br> Did it mean something to you?<br> I want to do that. I want to be a priest.<br> You'd be a good one, I'm sure.<br> Here.<br> Take a look.<br> See?<br> She's dancin'. Kinda neat.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Here. You try.<br> That's for you. Take it.<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Like Noah's Ark, girls. Two by two.<br> Morning, Sister James.<br> Good morning, Father Flynn.<br> Beautiful day.<br> Not too bad.<br> How are the criminals doing today?<br> - Not bad, Father.<br> - Good, Father.<br> - Morning, Champ.<br> - Morning, Father Flynn.<br> You wash those hands today,<br> Mister London?<br> I washed em, Father.<br> I don't know. They're a different<br> color than your neck.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, Father.<br> - Sister, are we having the test today?<br> - Tomorrow, William.<br> - Is it long division?<br> - Among other things.<br> - Sister.<br> - Good morning, Sister.<br> - How much of it will be long division?<br> - Boy!<br> William London. Come up here!<br> Come smartly now. Don't make me wait.<br> - What did he do?<br> - He touched Sister James.<br> The dragon is hungry!<br> You don't touch a nun.<br> Take out your history books, please.<br> Turn to page 683.<br> Yes, Ralph.<br> - I forgot my history book.<br> - You can look on with Raymond.<br> Mr. London?<br> Do you have your history book?<br> - No, Sister.<br> - Share with Mr. Malloy, please.<br> Do I have to? His breath stinks!<br> I'm sure Mr. Malloy's breath<br> is just fine.<br> Be seated.<br> Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the 32nd<br> president of The United States.<br> That barrette out of your hair,<br> Miss Horan.<br> Yes, Sister.<br> Morning, Sister James. Continue.<br> Franklin D. Roosevelt,<br> together with Abraham Lincoln<br> and John Fitzgerald Kennedy,<br> was perhaps our greatest president.<br> When he assumed office, 13,000,000<br> people in this country were unemployed.<br> They'd lost hope. And President<br> Roosevelt said to these people:<br> "The only thing we have to fear<br> is fear itself."<br> What did he mean by that? James?<br> I think he was trying to say there's<br> nothing really wrong, you know?<br> So don't get so emotional.<br> Maybe...<br> Maybe he was saying<br> that the world is good<br> and we need only work together<br> to overcome our problems.<br> What's this, Mr. Conroy?<br> I don't know, Sister.<br> You don't know<br> you have a wire coming out of your ear?<br> - No.<br> - Huh?<br> Huh?<br> No, Sister. I didn't.<br> You come with me, boy.<br> Go.<br> Who knows what the New Deal was?<br> I love this song.<br> This past Sunday.<br> What do you think that sermon was about?<br> - Sister James.<br> - Huh?<br> What was Father Flynn's sermon about?<br> Well, Doubt.<br> He was talking about Doubt?<br> Why?<br> Excuse me, Sister?<br> Well, sermons come from somewhere,<br> don't they?<br> Is Father Flynn in Doubt?<br> Is he concerned that<br> someone else is in Doubt?<br> I suppose you'd have to ask him.<br> No, that would not be appropriate.<br> He is my superior.<br> And if he were troubled,<br> he should confess it to a fellow priest,<br> or to the Monsignor.<br> We do not share intimate<br> information with priests.<br> - No.<br> - That's true.<br> - What are we saying?<br> - I want you all to be alert.<br> I am concerned, perhaps needlessly,<br> about matters in St. Nicholas School.<br> Academically?<br> I was not inviting a guessing game,<br> Sister Raymond.<br> Missy! Get away from her. And sit down.<br> May I join you, Sister Aloysius?<br> Yes.<br> - Chicken Chow Mein.<br> - Sister Veronica's favorite.<br> - It's very good.<br> - I like the noodles. I like the crunch.<br> - What happened to William London?<br> - I sent him home.<br> Oh dear. So he's still bleeding?<br> Yes.<br> His nose just let loose and started<br> gushing during the Pledge of Allegiance.<br> Was it spontaneous?<br> - What?<br> - His nosebleed.<br> - What else would it be?<br> - Self-induced.<br> You mean you think he might've<br> intentionally given himself a nosebleed?<br> Exactly.<br> No.<br> You are a very innocent person,<br> Sister James.<br> William London is a fidgety boy.<br> If you do not keep right on him,<br> he will do anything to escape his chair.<br> He would set his foot on fire<br> for half a day out of school.<br> Here. Sister, allow me to help you.<br> Your sleeve.<br> Mmm. Let's see.<br> Oh thank you, Sister.<br> - Sister Veronica is going blind.<br> - Oh how horrible!<br> If they find out in the rectory,<br> she'll be gone.<br> So, if she looks unsteady,<br> take her hand.<br> Ordinarily, I assign my most experienced<br> teachers to eighth grade,<br> but I am working within constraints.<br> - Are you in control of your class?<br> - I think so.<br> Usually more students<br> are sent down to me.<br> - I try to take care of things myself.<br> - That can be an error.<br> You are answerable to me,<br> I to the Monsignor, he to the Bishop,<br> and so on up to the Holy Father.<br> There is a chain. Make use of it.<br> - Candy?<br> - Cough drops.<br> Candy by another name.<br> - How is Donald Miller doing?<br> - Steady.<br> Good.<br> That girl... Noreen Horan.<br> I've seated her as far away from the<br> boys as possible. Doesn't do much good.<br> Just get her through. Intact.<br> What's this?<br> The wind is so... peripatetic this year.<br> Is that the word I want?<br> Is something the matter?<br> - What?<br> - Is something the matter?<br> No. Why? Is something the matter?<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Well, then, nothing's the matter then.<br> - Yes.<br> - What's this?<br> - A pen?<br> - A ballpoint pen.<br> The students are not using them<br> for assignments, I hope?<br> - No, of course not. - I'm sorry I allowed<br> even cartridge pens into this school.<br> Always the easy way out these days.<br> Every easy choice today<br> will have its consequence tomorrow.<br> - Mark my words.<br> - Yes.<br> Ballpoints make them press down, when<br> they press down, they write like monkeys.<br> - I don't allow them ballpoint pens.<br> - And yet here one is.<br> Penmanship is dying<br> all across this country.<br> I hope not.<br> You should frame something.<br> Put it up on the blackboard.<br> Put the Pope up.<br> That's the wrong Pope. He's deceased.<br> I don't care what Pope it is.<br> Use the glass to see behind you.<br> The children should think you have eyes<br> in the back of your head.<br> - Wouldn't that be a little frightening?<br> - Only to the ones who are up to no good.<br> Relax. Put it up there.<br> All right, now.<br> The thing about shooting from<br> the foul line is it's psychological.<br> All right, come up with a routine.<br> All right, shift your weight,<br> move your hips...<br> Hey, you think that's funny, Ralph?<br> You know what's funny is<br> you never getting a foul shot.<br> All right, concentrate on the routine,<br> and you'll forget to get tensed up.<br> All right, go ahead, Jimmy.<br> Good man. You listen. That's good.<br> All right, now sit down. Everyone.<br> Good.<br> On another matter, I've noticed<br> several of you guys got dirty nails.<br> I don't want to see that.<br> I'm not talking about the length of your<br> nails, I'm talking about cleanliness.<br> See? Look at my nails.<br> All right, they're long,<br> I like them a little long,<br> but look at how clean they are.<br> That makes it okay.<br> The climpity-clomp.<br> Clomp clomp clomp.<br> Harder than a herd of elephants.<br> You are wicked!<br> No, I told her, "You're her mother!<br> You raised her, you fed her,<br> YOU tell her she's fat!"<br> - Oh!<br> - But wait, how fat is she?<br> - What, the mother or the daughter?<br> - The daughter.<br> - I never met the daughter.<br> - What about the mother?<br> Fat!!!<br> Father, we having practice after school?<br> If you guys want it, we can have it.<br> Let me know.<br> The Fascist governments of Germany<br> and Italy were already working together.<br> They formed the Pact of Steel.<br> The Pact of Steel was a military alliance<br> between Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.<br> Mister London, get back in your seat<br> and stop bothering Miss Horan, please.<br> Now, who can tell me---<br> Yes?<br> Yes. Of course, Father.<br> Donald? You should go to the Rectory.<br> Two, three, four, five, six,<br> seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.<br> Go one, two, three, touch.<br> One, two, three, kick.<br> And back, side, front, kick.<br> Back, side, front...<br> - Raymond, what are you doing?<br> - The mashed potato.<br> You're supposed to be doing<br> the bossa nova.<br> But I know the mashed potato.<br> All right, now follow.<br> Back, side, front, kick.<br> Back, side, one, two, three, kick.<br> Back, side, front, kick.<br> Back, side, front.

Come, Sister.<br> What have you seen?<br> It is unsettling to look at people with<br> suspicion.

Go, go.<br> I'd invite you in, but we're<br> just short Sister James.<br> - Hear that wind last night?<br> - I certainly did!<br> Did I hear Sister Veronica<br> had an accident?<br> Yes, Sister Veronica fell and<br> practically killed herself.<br> - Is she alright?<br> - Oh, she's fine.<br> - Her sight isn't good, is it?<br> - Her sight is fine.<br> Nuns fall, you know.<br> Nah, I didn't know that.<br> It's the habit.<br> It catches us up more often than not.<br> We go down like dominoes.<br> - Am I past the time?<br> - Not at all.<br> Good morning, Father.<br> Good morning, Sister.<br> I'm sorry I was delayed.<br> I ran into Sister Veronica.<br> - How is she?<br> - I'm afraid she has a bit of a bloody nose.<br> I'm beginning to think<br> you're punching people.<br> - Sister?<br> - First William London and now ...<br> Never mind.<br> Well, come in, please.<br> Sister...<br> Please. Sit. Have a seat.<br> I actually have a hot pot of tea.<br> And close this but not quite<br> for form's sake.<br> Father, would you care for a...<br> - Would you have a cup of tea, Father?<br> - I would love a cup of tea.<br> - Sister, perhaps you could serve him?<br> - I'd be glad.<br> And yourself, of course.<br> Would you like a cup of tea,<br> Sister Aloysius?<br> - No, I've already had my cup.<br> - Is there sugar?<br> Sugar?<br> Yes!<br> Yes. It's somewhere here.<br> I put it in the drawer for Lent last year<br> and never remembered to take it out.<br> Ah, it mustn't have been much<br> to give up then.<br> I'm sure you're right. Here it is.<br> I'll serve you, though for want of practice,<br> I'm, I'm a little clumsy.<br> I see your fingernails.<br> I wear them a little long.<br> - The Sugar?<br> - Yes.<br> - One?<br> - Three.<br> - Three?<br> - Sweet tooth.<br> Two...<br> Three...<br> - Sister, you care for sugar?<br> - Never!<br> Not that there's anything<br> wrong with sugar.<br> Well, thank you, Father, for making<br> time for us. We are at our wit's end.<br> Well, I think it's an excellent idea<br> to rethink the Christmas pageant.<br> 'Cause last year's effort<br> was a little woebegone.<br> Oh, I loved it! But I love all pageants.<br> The hymns!<br> O Little Town of Bethlehem,<br> O Come O Come Emmanuel,<br> - O Come All Ye Faithful...<br> - All right. Thank you, Sister James!<br> So what do you think, Father?<br> Is there something new we could do?<br> Well, we all love the Christmas hymns,<br> but it might be jolly to include<br> a secular song.<br> Secular?<br> Yes. IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LO LIKE CHRISTMAS. Something like that.<br> What would be the point of<br> a secular song?<br> Just fun.<br> - Or FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.<br> - That's a good one.<br> We could have one of the boys dress<br> as a snowman and dance around.<br> Which boy?<br> We'd do tryouts.<br> FROSTY THE SNOWMAN<br> espouses a pagan belief in magic.<br> The snowman comes to life when<br> an enchanted hat is put on his head.<br> If the music were more somber,<br> people would realize the images<br> are disturbing and the song heretical.<br> I've never thought about<br> Frosty The Snowman like that.<br> - It should be banned from the airwaves.<br> - So. Not FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.<br> Oh, IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE A LO LIKE CHRISTMAS would be fine, I suppose.<br> Parents would like it.<br> May I ask what you're writing down?<br> With that ballpoint pen?<br> Oh. Nothing. It's an idea for a sermon.<br> - You had one right now?<br> - I get them all the time.<br> How fortunate.<br> I forget them so I have to<br> write them down.<br> Oh. What is the idea?<br> Intolerance.<br> - Would you like a little more tea, Father?<br> - Not yet.<br> It's a new time, Sister.<br> - What's new about this?<br> - Something inside of people is new.<br> There is nothing new under the sun.<br> The Church needs to change.<br> We should sing a song from the radio<br> now and then.<br> - Take the kids out for ice cream.<br> - Sweet tooth.<br> Maybe take the boys on a camping trip.<br> The point being?<br> We should be friendlier.<br> You know, the children and the parents<br> should see us as members of their family.<br> But we are not members of their family.<br> We're different.<br> - Why? Because of our vows?<br> - Precisely.<br> I don't think we're so different.<br> You know, Sister,<br> I would take some more tea.<br> And they think we're different, yeah?<br> The working class...<br> The working class people of this parish<br> trust us to be different.<br> Uh, I think we're getting off the subject.<br> Yes, you're right. You're right.<br> Back to it.<br> Yes, Sister Raymond?<br> Well you tell her to wash her face<br> and her neck and report to me at three.<br> Yes.<br> Excuse me.<br> The Christmas pageant.<br> We must be careful how<br> Donald Miller is used in the pageant.<br> Easy there, Sister.<br> All right, what about Donald Miller?<br> We must be careful, in the pageant,<br> that we neither hide Donald Miller<br> nor put him forward.<br> - Because of the color of his skin?<br> - That's right, yeah.<br> Why?<br> Oh come, Father.<br> I think he should be treated<br> like every other boy.<br> Well, you yourself singled the boy out<br> for special attention.<br> You held a private meeting with him<br> at the Rectory. A week ago?<br> Yes.<br> What are we talking about?<br> Donald Miller?<br> The boy acted strangely<br> when he returned to class.<br> He did?<br> When he returned from the Rectory.<br> A little odd, yes.<br> Can you tell us why?<br> How did he act strangely?<br> He... I'm not sure how to explain it.<br> He... he laid his head on the desk,<br> and... some...<br> - Do you mean you had some impression?<br> - Yes.<br> And he'd come from the Rectory<br> so you're asking me?<br> That's it.<br> Did you want to discuss the pageant,<br> is that why I'm here,<br> or is this what you wanted to discuss?<br> This.<br> Well. I'm a little uncomfortable.<br> - Why?<br> - Why do you think?<br> The boy's well-being is my responsibility.<br> His well-being is not at issue.<br> I'm not satisfied that that is true.<br> He was upset when he returned to class.<br> - Did he say something?<br> - No.<br> What happened in the Rectory?<br> Happened?<br> Nothing happened.<br> I had a talk with the boy.<br> - What about?<br> - Private matter.<br> He's twelve years old.<br> What could be private?<br> - Should I get the phone---?<br> - No.<br> I object to your tone.<br> This is not about my tone...<br> or your tone, Father Flynn.<br> - It's about arriving at the truth.<br> - Of what?<br> You know what I'm talking about.<br> Don't you?<br> You're controlling the expression<br> on your face right now. Aren't you?<br> My face?<br> What exactly are you accusing me of?<br> I am not accusing you of anything,<br> Father Flynn.<br> I am asking you to tell me<br> what happened in the Rectory.<br> I don't wish to continue this.<br> And if you're dissatisfied with that,<br> I suggest you speak to Monsignor Benedict.<br> I can only imagine this unfortunate<br> behavior is the result of overwork.<br> Have a good morning. Sister.<br> Sister.<br> There was alcohol on his breath.<br> When he returned from<br> his meeting with you.<br> Alcohol.<br> I did smell it on his breath.<br> Well?<br> - Let this alone.<br> - No.<br> Take your time, Father.<br> Would you like some more tea?<br> You should've let it alone.<br> Not possible.<br> Mr. McGuinn caught Donald drinking<br> altar wine.<br> When I found out, I sent for him.<br> There were tears.<br> And he begged not to be removed<br> from the altar boys. I took pity on him.<br> I told him if no one else found out,<br> I would let him stay on.<br> Oh, what a relief!<br> That explains everything!<br> Thanks be to God!<br> Look, Sister, it was all a mistake!<br> And if I talk to Mr. McGuinn?<br> Oh, talk to him by all means.<br> But now that the boy's secret's out,<br> I'm going to have to remove him<br> from the altar boys.<br> That's what I was trying to avoid.<br> - You were trying to protect the boy!<br> - That's right.<br> I might have done the same thing!<br> Is there a way Donald could stay<br> on the altar boys?<br> If the boy drank altar wine,<br> he can't continue as an altar boy.<br> Of course.<br> - Are you satisfied?<br> - Yes.<br> Well, I'll be going.<br> I have some writing to do.<br> - Intolerance.<br> - That's right.<br> I'm not pleased with<br> how you handled this, Sister.<br> Sister.<br> Well.<br> What a relief! He cleared it all up.<br> - You believe him?<br> - Of course.<br> Isn't it that it's easier to believe him?<br> But we can corroborate<br> his story with Mr. McGuinn.<br> Yes.<br> These types of people are clever.<br> - Well, I'm convinced!<br> - You're not.<br> You just want things to be resolved<br> so you can have simplicity back.<br> I want no further part of this.<br> I'll bring him down.<br> How can you be so sure that he is lying?<br> Experience.<br> You just don't like him!<br> You don't like it that he uses<br> a ballpoint pen.<br> You don't like it that he takes<br> three lumps of sugar in his tea.<br> You don't like it that he likes<br> FROSTY THE SNOWMAN.<br> And you're letting that convince you<br> of something terrible, just terrible!<br> Well, I like FROSTY THE SNOWMAN!<br> And I think it would be nice<br> if this school weren't run like a jail!<br> And I think it's a good thing<br> that I love to teach History<br> and that I might inspire<br> my students to love it, too!<br> And if you judge that to mean that I'm<br> not fit to be a teacher, then so be it!<br> Sit down.<br> Look at that. You blew out my light.<br> In ancient Sparta, important matters<br> were decided by who shouted loudest.<br> Fortunately, we are not<br> in ancient Sparta.<br> You honestly find the students in this school<br> to be treated like inmates in a prison?<br> No.<br> Actually, they all seem fairly happy.<br> But they're all uniformly terrified of you!<br> Yes. That's how it works.<br> Sit there.<br> Hello, this is Sister Aloysius Beauvier,<br> principal at St. Nicholas School.<br> Is this Mrs. Miller?<br> I'm calling about your son, Donald.<br> A woman was gossiping with a friend<br> about a man she hardly knew--<br> I know none of you have ever done this---<br> --that night she had a dream.<br> A great hand appeared over her<br> and pointed down at her.<br> She was immediately seized with<br> an overwhelming sense of guilt.<br> The next day she went to confession.<br> She got the old parish priest,<br> Father O'Rourke,<br> and she told him the whole thing.<br> "Is gossiping a sin?"<br> she asked the old man.<br> "Was that the hand of God Almighty<br> pointing a finger at me?"<br> "Should I be asking your absolution?<br> Father, tell me,<br> have I done something wrong?"<br> "Yes!" Father O'Rourke answered her.<br> "Yes, you ignorant,<br> badly brought-up female!<br> You have borne false witness<br> against your neighbor,<br> you have played fast and loose<br> with his reputation,<br> and you should be heartily ashamed!"<br> So the woman said she was sorry<br> and asked for forgiveness.<br> "Not so fast!" says O'Rourke.<br> "I want you to go home,<br> take a pillow up on your roof,<br> cut it open with a knife,<br> and return here to me!"<br> So the woman went home, took a pillow<br> off her bed, a knife from the drawer,<br> went up the fire escape to the roof,<br> and stabbed the pillow.<br> Then she went back to the old<br> parish priest as instructed.<br> "Did you gut the pillow with the knife?"<br> he says.<br> "Yes, Father."<br> "And what was the result?"<br> "Feathers," she said.<br> "Feathers?" he repeated.<br> "Feathers everywhere, Father!"<br> "Now I want you to go back<br> and gather up every last feather<br> that flew out on the wind!"<br> "Well," she said, "it can't be done."<br> "I don't know where they went.<br> The wind took them all over."<br> "And that,"said Father O'Rourke,<br> "is gossip!"<br> In the name of the Father, the Son,<br> and the Holy Ghost, Amen.<br> Please rise.<br> What's that bird complaining about?<br> What kind of bird is that?<br> That a starling? A grackle?<br> A crow.<br> 'Course it is.<br> Are you praying?<br> I didn't mean to interrupt.<br> I'm not praying, no.<br> You seem subdued.<br> Oh. I can't sleep.<br> - Why not?<br> - Bad dreams.<br> Yeah, I can't sleep on occasion.<br> Why? Do you see that big hand<br> pointing a finger at you?<br> Yes. Sometimes.<br> Was your sermon directed<br> at anyone in particular?<br> What do you think?<br> I received a letter from my brother<br> in Maryland. He's very sick.<br> - Then maybe you should go and see him.<br> - I can't leave my class.<br> Is it true?<br> What?<br> You know what I'm asking.<br> No.<br> I saw you put an undershirt<br> in Donald Miller's locker.<br> - He left it in the sacristy.<br> - Why didn't you hand it to him?<br> I'm trying to spare him<br> further embarrassment.<br> It's me that cares about that child,<br> not her.<br> Has she ever reached out a hand?<br> That black boy needs help<br> or he's not going to make it!<br> If she has her way, he'll be<br> left to his own undoing.<br> Why do you think he drank the wine?<br> He's in trouble!<br> And she sees me talk in a human way<br> to these kids and she immediately assumes<br> that there must be<br> something wrong with it.<br> Well, I'm not going to let her<br> keep this parish in the dark ages!<br> And I'm not going to let her<br> destroy my spirit of compassion!<br> I'm sure that's not her intent.<br> - That I care about this congregation!<br> - I know you do.<br> Like you care about your class!<br> You love them, don't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - And that's natural.<br> How else would you relate to children?<br> That I can look at your face and<br> know your philosophy. It's kindness.<br> I don't know. I mean, of course.<br> There are people who go<br> after your humanity, Sister,<br> that tell you the light in your heart<br> is a weakness. Don't believe it.<br> It's an old tactic of cruel people<br> to kill kindness in the name of virtue.<br> There's nothing wrong with love.<br> Love?<br> Have you forgotten the message<br> of our Savior? It's love of people.<br> I just feel as if everything<br> is upside down.<br> There are just times in life<br> when we feel lost. It happens.<br> And it's a bond.<br> - Flowers.<br> - To remind me of Spring.<br> I should be going.<br> - I'm sorry your brother's ill.<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> I don't believe it!<br> You don't?<br> No.<br> Thank you, Sister. Thank you very much.<br> Father, I think I've just<br> got to tell somebody.<br> - Hello, Noreen.<br> - I'm in love.<br> - That's wonderful. Who's the lucky boy?<br> - Jimmy Hurley.<br> Have you told him?<br> - Maybe you should.<br> - Maybe I will, Father.<br> Jimmy! Jimmy Hurley!<br> Over here.<br> Father Sherman...<br> You drop something.<br> It's all right.<br> Okay. Be quiet.<br> I said be quiet!<br> The next one of you that speaks out of<br> turn gets sent right to the Principal!<br> Now the question was:<br> What was Patrick Henry's famous remark?<br> - Donald.<br> - Sister?<br> What was the question?<br> Nobody help him.<br> Jimmy, put your hand down.<br> Donald Miller, stand up.<br> - What was the question, Donald?<br> - I don't know, Sister.<br> - That means you weren't listening.<br> - Yes, Sister.<br> The question was:<br> What was Patrick Henry's famous remark?<br> - I don't know.<br> - "Give me liberty or give me death!"<br> James Hurley, down to the<br> Principal's office now!<br> - Mrs. Miller?<br> - Yes.<br> Come in.<br> Please have a seat.<br> I was changing a bulb.<br> I thought I mighta had the wrong day.<br> You didn't answer.<br> Huh? Oh. Well, just between us,<br> Iwas listening to a transistor radio<br> with an earpiece.<br> Look how tiny they're making 'em.<br> I confiscated it from one of the students,<br> now I can't stop listening to it.<br> You like music?<br> No. News reports.<br> Years ago I used to listen<br> to all the news reports<br> because my husband was in Italy<br> in the war.<br> - You were a married woman?<br> - Yes. But then he was killed.<br> - Is your husband coming?<br> - Couldn't get off work.<br> I only have a half an hour myself.<br> I see. Of course. It was a lot to ask.<br> How's Donald doing?<br> He's passing his subjects.<br> He has average grades.<br> Hmm. Good. He was upset about<br> getting taken off the altar boys.<br> Did he explain why?<br> He said he was caught<br> drinking altar wine.<br> That is the reason.<br> Well, that seems fair.<br> But he's a good boy, Sister.<br> He fell down there, but he's a good boy<br> pretty much down the line.<br> How is he at home?<br> His father beat the hell out of him<br> over that wine.<br> Oh, he shouldn't do that!<br> You don't tell my husband what to do.<br> You just stand back.<br> My husband didn't want<br> Donald to come here.<br> - Why?<br> - He thought he'd have trouble<br> with the other boys.<br> But that hasn't eally happened.<br> Good.<br> That priest, Father Flynn,<br> been watching out for him.<br> Yes.<br> Excuse me.<br> - James Hurley, what are you doing out<br> of class? - Sister James sent me down.<br> - What for?<br> - Talking.<br> Well, go back up and shut up!<br> Go, go!<br> What's going on?<br> None of your business!<br> Go on! Go back to class.<br> Bullshit.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - Nothing.<br> - You have twenty minutes you say?<br> - It's just that I have to walk to work.<br> - Where is work?<br> - Parkchester.<br> If I don't start cleaning by noon,<br> I'm not home to let Donald in.<br> - May I walk with you?<br> - I don't mind.<br> ...eight sixty-fourths. Who can tell me<br> what the common denominator is?<br> Nobody?<br> Back already, Mr. Hurley?<br> - I said, back already, Mr. Hurley?!<br> - Leave me alone.<br> Who do you think you're talking to?<br> This is my classroom, Boy.<br> Don't you forget that.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, Jimmy.<br> Have you met Father Flynn?<br> Just seen him on the altar,<br> haven't met him face to face.<br> No. Just, you know, heard from Donald.<br> And what does he say?<br> Oh, you know,<br> "Father Flynn, Father Flynn."<br> He looks up to him. The man gives him<br> his time, which is what the boy needs.<br> He needs that.<br> Mrs. Miller, we may have a problem.<br> Well, I thought there musta been<br> a reason you wanting to see me.<br> Principal's a big job.<br> I just want to say though,<br> it's just till June.<br> Excuse me?<br> Whatever the problem is,<br> Donald just has to make it till June.<br> - Then he's off into high school.<br> - Right.<br> If Donald can graduate<br> from St. Nicholas,<br> he's got a better chance of getting<br> into a good high school.<br> And that would mean<br> an opportunity at college.<br> I don't see anything at this time standing<br> in the way of his graduating with his class.<br> - Well, that's all I care about.<br> - I doubt that.<br> Try me.<br> I am concerned about the relationship<br> between Father Flynn and your son.<br> You don't say. Concerned.<br> What do you mean, concerned?<br> That it may not be right.<br> Well, there's something wrong<br> with everybody, isn't that so?<br> Got to be forgiving. I work right there.<br> I'm concerned, to be frank,<br> that Father Flynn may have<br> made advances on your son.<br> - May have made.<br> - I can't be certain.<br> - No evidence?<br> - No.<br> Then maybe there's nothing to it.<br> I think there is something to it.<br> I think Father Flynn gave<br> Donald that altar wine.<br> Why would he do that?<br> - Has Donald been acting strange lately?<br> - No.<br> - Nothing out of the ordinary?<br> - He's been himself.<br> - Alright.<br> - Look, Sister. I don't want any trouble.<br> I don't uhh... I'm not sure<br> you completely understand.<br> I think I understand the kind of thing<br> you're talking about.<br> But I don't want to get into it.<br> What's that?<br> Look, I only have a few minutes.<br> Not to be disagreeing, but if we're<br> talking about something floating<br> around between this priest and my son,<br> it ain't my son's fault.<br> - Oh, I'm not suggesting that---<br> - He's just a boy.<br> - I know.<br> - Twelve years old.<br> If somebody should be taking blame,<br> it should be the man, not the boy.<br> - I know. I agree with you completely.<br> - You're agreeing with me,<br> but I got called to the principal<br> if you know what I'm saying.<br> I am concerned about Donald's welfare.<br> You honestly think that priest<br> gave Donald that wine to drink?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Then how come<br> my son got kicked off the altar boys<br> - if it was the man that gave it to him?<br> - I know.<br> The boy got caught, the man didn't.<br> - So you're giving my son the blame.<br> - No.<br> No problem my son getting blamed.<br> And you know why that is?<br> Perhaps you should let me talk.<br> I think you're getting upset now.<br> Sister, you ain't going against no MAN<br> in a ROBE and win.<br> - He's got the position.<br> - And he's got your son.<br> Let him have him then.<br> What?<br> It's just till June.<br> - Do you know what you're saying?<br> - Know more about it than you.<br> I believe this man is creating or<br> may have already brought about<br> - an improper relationship with your son.<br> - I don't know.<br> I know I am right.<br> Why you gotta know something like<br> that for sure when you don't?<br> What kind of mother are you?<br> Excuse me, but you don't know<br> enough about life to say<br> - a thing like that, Sister.<br> - I know enough.<br> You know the rules maybe,<br> but that don't cover it.<br> I know what I won't accept!<br> You accept what you gotta accept<br> and you work with it.<br> This man is in my school.<br> Well, he's gotta be somewhere<br> and maybe he's doing some good, too.<br> He is after the boys!<br> Well, maybe some of them boys want<br> to get caught!<br> That's why his father beat him.<br> Not the wine.<br> What are you telling me?<br> I'm talking about the boy's nature now,<br> not anything he's done.<br> You can't hold a child responsible<br> for what God gave him to be.<br> I'm only interested in actions,<br> Mrs. Miller.<br> But then there's the boy's nature.<br> - Leave that out of it.<br> - Forget it then.<br> You're the one forcing people<br> to say things.<br> My boy came to your school 'cause they<br> were going to kill him in the public school.<br> His father don't like him.<br> He come to your school,<br> kids don't like him.<br> One man is good to him. This priest.<br> Then does the man have his reasons? Yes.<br> Everybody does. YOU have your reasons.<br> But do I ask the man<br> why he's good to my son?<br> No.<br> I don't care why.<br> My son needs some man to care about him<br> and to see him through the way<br> he wants to go.<br> I thank God, this educated man with some<br> kindness in him wants to do just that.<br> - This will not do.<br> - It's just till June.<br> I'll throw your son out of this school.<br> And why would you do that<br> if it didn't start with him?<br> Because I will stop this.<br> - You'd hurt my son to get your way?<br> - It won't end with your son.<br> - Throw the priest out then.<br> - I am trying to do just that.<br> Then what do you want from me?<br> Nothing.<br> As it turns out.<br> Please leave my son out of this.<br> My husband will kill that child<br> over a thing like this.<br> I will try.<br> I'm late.<br> Sister,<br> I don't know if you and me<br> on the same side.<br> I'll be standing with my son and those<br> who are good with my son.<br> It'd be nice to see you there.<br> Good morning.<br> May I come in?<br> A third party would be required.<br> Yeah. What was Donald's mother<br> doing here?<br> - We were having a chat.<br> - About what?<br> A third party would truly be<br> required, Father. Why---<br> No, Sister. No third party.<br> You and me are due for a talk.<br> You have to stop this<br> campaign against me!<br> You can stop it at any time.<br> - How?<br> - Confess and resign.<br> You are attempting to destroy my reputation!<br> Who keeps opening my window?!<br> - What are you doing in this school?<br> - I'm trying to do good!<br> Even more to the point,<br> what are you doing in the priesthood?<br> You are single-handedly holding<br> this school and this parish back!<br> - From what? - Progressive education<br> and a welcoming Church.<br> You can't distract me, Father. This is<br> not about my behavior, it's about yours.<br> No, this is about your<br> unfounded suspicions.<br> - That's right. I have suspicions.<br> - Just leave that. It's not important.<br> I will decide what's important.<br> WHY do you suspect me? What have I done?<br> You gave that boy wine,<br> and you let him take the blame.<br> That's completely untrue!<br> Did you talk to Mr. McGuinn?<br> All McGuinn knows is<br> that the boy drank wine.<br> He doesn't know how he came to drink it.<br> Did his mother have something<br> to add to that?<br> No.<br> - So that's it.<br> - I am not satisfied.<br> - Ask the boy then!<br> - Oh, he'd protect you.<br> - Why would he do that?<br> - Because you have seduced him.<br> You're insane! You've got it in<br> your head that I've corrupted<br> this child after giving him wine,<br> and nothing I say will change that.<br> - That's right. - But this has<br> nothing to do with the wine.<br> Not really. You had a fundamental<br> mistrust of me before this incident!<br> It was you that warned Sister James<br> to be on the lookout, wasn't it?<br> That's true.<br> - So you admit it!<br> - Certainly.<br> Why?<br> I know people.<br> - That's not good enough!<br> - It won't have to be.<br> - How's that?<br> - You will tell me what you have done!<br> Oh I will?<br> Out again!<br> Sister James is convinced I'm innocent.<br> Oh, so you talked to Sister James?<br> Well, of course you talked to<br> Sister James.<br> - Did you know that Donald's<br> father beats him? - Yes.<br> And might that not account for the odd<br> behavior Sister James noticed in the boy?<br> It might.<br> Then what is it? What?<br> What did you hear, what did you see<br> that convinced you so thoroughly?<br> - What does it matter?<br> - It matters! What does it matter?<br> I want to know.<br> Out this window I saw<br> you grab William London's wrist and...<br> I saw him pull away.<br> - Are you serious?<br> - I am.<br> - That's all?<br> - Yeah. That was all.<br> That's nothing!<br> - What are you doing now?<br> - I'm writing down what you say.<br> It might be important when I have to<br> explain why you have to be removed.<br> This morning, before I spoke<br> with Mrs. Miller,<br> I took the precaution of calling<br> your last parish.<br> What'd he say?<br> - Who?<br> - The Pastor.<br> I did not speak to the Pastor.<br> I spoke to a nun.<br> - You should have spoken to the Pastor.<br> - I spoke to a nun.<br> You know that's not the proper route<br> for you to have taken, Sister!<br> The Church is very clear.<br> You're supposed to go through the Pastor.<br> Why? You have an understanding,<br> you and he?<br> No, you have no right to go rummaging<br> through my past!<br> You have a history. This is your<br> third parish in five years.<br> - Call the Pastor.<br> - Why?<br> Ask him why I left!<br> It's perfectly innocent.<br> - I'm not calling the Pastor.<br> - I'm a good priest!<br> You will go after another child and<br> another child, until you are stopped.<br> - What nun did you speak to?<br> - I won't say.<br> - I've not touched a child.<br> - You have.<br> You haven't the slightest proof<br> of anything.<br> But I have my certainty, and armed<br> with that, I will go to your last parish,<br> and the one before that if necessary.<br> I'll find a parent.<br> Trust me, Father Flynn, I will.<br> You have no right to act on your own!<br> You have taken vows, obedience being one!<br> You answer to us! You have no right<br> to step outside the church!<br> I will step outside the church<br> if that's what needs to be done,<br> till the door should shut behind me!<br> I will do what needs to be done,<br> though I'm damned to Hell!<br> You should understand that,<br> or you will mistake me.<br> Now, did you give Donald Miller<br> wine to drink?<br> - Have you never done anything wrong?<br> - I have.<br> A mortal sin?<br> Yes.<br> And?<br> I confessed it, Father!<br> Then whatever I have done, I have left<br> in the healing hands of my confessor.<br> As have you! We are the same!<br> No, we are not, we are not the same!<br> A dog that bites is a dog that bites!<br> Did you give Donald Miller wine to drink?<br> No.<br> Mental reservation?<br> No.<br> You lie.<br> Very well then.<br> If you will not leave my office, I will.<br> And once I go, I will not stop.<br> Wait.<br> I can't say everything, you understand?<br> There's things I can't say.<br> Even if you can't imagine<br> the explanation, Sister,<br> remember there are things<br> beyond your knowledge.<br> Even if you feel certainty,<br> it is an emotion, not a fact.<br> You will request a transfer, and take<br> a leave of absence until it's granted.<br> You'd leave me nothing.<br> It's Donald Miller who has nothing,<br> and you took full advantage of that.<br> I've done nothing wrong.<br> I care about that boy.<br> Why?<br> 'Cause you smile at him<br> and you sympathize with him<br> and you talk to him<br> as if you were the same?<br> You are a cheat.<br> And that warm feeling you experienced,<br> when that boy looked at you with trust,<br> was not the sensation of virtue.<br> That could be got by any drunkard<br> with his tot of rum.<br> - I can fight you.<br> - You will lose.<br> - Where's your compassion?<br> - Nowhere you can get at it.<br> Stay here. Compose yourself.<br> You can use the phone if you like.<br> Good day, Father.<br> I have no sympathy for you. I know<br> you are invulnerable to true regret.<br> And cut your nails.<br> I never like to say goodbye.<br> But there is a wind behind every one<br> of us that takes us through our lives.<br> We never see it, we can't command it,<br> we don't even know its purpose.<br> I would have stayed among you longer,<br> but that wind is taking me away.<br> I will miss it here.<br> And I will miss you.<br> But I'm content<br> that the power that propels me<br> does so with superior knowledge<br> as to what is for the best, and that is my faith.<br> I would like to come down now<br> among you and say goodbye,<br> and wish you peaceful hearts<br> and loving hearts.<br> Goodbye, son.<br> Happy holidays.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you so much.<br> God bless you.<br> Good bye.<br> - Sister James, welcome back.<br> - Thank you, Sister.<br> - You were missed. How is your brother?<br> - Better. Much better.<br> I'm very glad. I prayed for him.<br> It was good to get away.<br> I needed to see my family.<br> Then I'm glad you did it.<br> And Father Flynn is gone.<br> Yes.<br> So you did it. You got him out.<br> Yes.<br> Donald Miller is heartbroken.<br> Can't be helped. It's just till June.<br> I don't think Father Flynn<br> did anything wrong.<br> - No? He convinced you?<br> - Yes, he did.<br> - Did you ever prove it?<br> - To whom?<br> - Anyone but yourself?<br> - Nope.<br> - But you were sure.<br> - Yes.<br> I wish I could be like you.<br> - Why?<br> - Because I can't sleep anymore.<br> Maybe we're not supposed to sleep<br> so well.<br> They made Father Flynn<br> Pastor of Saint Jerome.<br> Who?<br> The Bishop appointed Father Flynn<br> Pastor of Saint Jerome Church and School.<br> It's a promotion.<br> You didn't tell them?<br> Oh, I told our good Monsignor.<br> I crossed the garden and I told him.<br> He did not believe it to be true.<br> Then why did Father Flynn go?<br> What did you say to make him leave?<br> That I had called a nun<br> in his previous parish.<br> That I had found out his prior<br> history of infringements.<br> So you did prove it!<br> I made no such call.<br> - You lied?<br> - Yes.<br> But if he'd had no such history,<br> the lie wouldn't have worked.<br> His resignation was his confession.<br> He was what I thought he was.<br> And he's gone.<br> I can't believe you lied.<br> In the pursuit of wrongdoing,<br> one steps away from God.<br> Of course there is a price.<br> I see.<br> Oh, Sister James!<br> What is it, Sister?<br> I have doubts!<br> I have such doubts!<br>
