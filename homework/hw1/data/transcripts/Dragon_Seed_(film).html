                        This is the valley of Ling...<br> ... as it was in the early summer of 1937.<br> The people who lived here were farmers.<br> They'd heard there was a world beyond<br> the hills that bounded their little valley...<br> ... but as yet, no one had climbed<br> those hills to see for himself.<br> Perhaps it is because<br> they were more fortunate than most.<br> The land was rich,<br> and their bellies were full.<br> On this farm, lived Ling Tan<br> and his family.<br> And they were among the most fortunate.<br> They were neither too wealthy,<br> nor too poor.<br> And they were greatly respected<br> in the nearby village.<br> They owned a strong house...<br> ... and tilled the soil<br> that belonged to their ancestors.<br> They were both good and bad,<br> both wise and foolish...<br> ... and sometimes all these things<br> at the same moment.<br> And therefore, they were very much<br> like such families in any other land.<br> It was time for the rice seedlings<br> to be planted...<br> ... and Ling Tan was eager<br> for but one thing:<br> To finish as much of the work<br> as could be done...<br> ... before the sun was gone from the sky.<br> But Ling's first and second sons<br> were eager for many other things as well.<br> For they were young.<br> Hey!<br> - Is that your mother?<br> - Yes, my father.<br> Come, old man. I want to speak to you.<br> Time enough to speak with women<br> when the sun is gone.<br> I know you hear me, you old turnip.<br> You two do not stop for anything<br> until the field is done.<br> Ease your heart about that, Father.<br> What is it, old woman? What is it?<br> You grow deaf?<br> Must I bawl like an ox to make you hear?<br> There is work<br> and you call me from the fields.<br> Come. Come.<br> You work too hard and too long.<br> You have sons to labor for you.<br> What nonsense is this?<br> I'm not yet so feeble.<br> You're no longer young<br> and you must not strain.<br> I do not strain myself.<br> I'm as much a man as I ever was.<br> Come now. Wash your legs.<br> The very weight of the mud<br> can tire a man of your great age.<br> Well, perhaps a younger wife with a softer<br> will might be added to a man's household.<br> Bring her on, old man.<br> I shall have someone<br> to help me with my work.<br> And you shall be in your grave<br> before your time.<br> I think I would survive.<br> I may try it to see.<br> What of those teeth marks<br> behind your right ear, old turnip?<br> A hill tiger bit me.<br> It was a long time ago.<br> I was the hill tiger.<br> You made the mistake of treating me<br> like a tame house cat.<br> It could happen again.<br> Not so long as the scars remain<br> to remind me.<br> Is it not good with me here?<br> Yes, it is, but a man with his juices<br> still in him should not so indulge himself.<br> - I should go back to the fields.<br> - The field will be finished without you.<br> Here. If you must be useful,<br> help me prepare these ducks for market.<br> Ducks. That is woman's work.<br> If heaven sends a woman too much work,<br> heaven will also send help to do it.<br> How is it, old woman, that heaven's will<br> and yours are always the same?<br> The grass is good in the hills<br> and the ox grows fat.<br> Which is the ox and which is our brother?<br> Is our brother dreaming?<br> No, that vacant look<br> is his usual expression.<br> You are very dirty.<br> Have you been playing in the mud?<br> We have. It was very pleasant.<br> Why do you not join us tomorrow?<br> Oh, you ask too much.<br> Where you find hard work,<br> you will not find our brother.<br> There is work for all. For those with strong<br> backs and for those with strong minds.<br> If the mind is strong,<br> the back need not bend.<br> Nor need the feet get muddy.<br> He has no mind, only a temper.<br> Brother, your mind is absent these days.<br> Why is this?<br> I think, and my thoughts trouble me.<br> What is a brother for<br> if not to share your troubles?<br> Well, then, here is one of the things:<br> Women are not the same as we are.<br> Married four months<br> and you just found this out?<br> But here is another thing:<br> Women do not think as men do.<br> Women should not think.<br> They're not equal to it.<br> My wife Jade is equal to it.<br> You worry too much<br> about that one of yours.<br> When she has a son,<br> a son will be more important.<br> A son. I have not yet a wife...<br> As I would have her.<br> She is like a western wind.<br> When I reach for her, she's gone.<br> Even western wind<br> can be caught and tamed.<br> I do not want her tame.<br> Only, I do not understand her.<br> She is mine and yet she is not mine.<br> When I touch her, it is as if her spirit goes<br> and only her body is left.<br> She is beautiful and sweet-smelling.<br> Is that not enough?<br> It is your fault. I've watched you.<br> When the men sit and smoke,<br> you're the first to leave.<br> Can I help it<br> if the desire for sleep overcomes me?<br> Do you not know that with a woman,<br> eagerness passes for weakness?<br> - Sit with the old men until the last as I do.<br> - That is easy for you.<br> I've not found Jade<br> in the same place twice.<br> And never waiting for me.<br> - Do you think that is the answer?<br> - Yes.<br> Then I will not go to her until dawn.<br> And perhaps not even then.<br> Jade, Orchid.<br> The men of the house are at home.<br> Now, where are the women<br> my sons married?<br> Jade, Orchid. Oh, there you are.<br> - Your husband comes. Attend him.<br> - I go, Mother.<br> Take this clean towel I have made ready.<br> Mother, I must tell you<br> about my youngest child.<br> My grandchild? What about her?<br> She was lying there and all at once,<br> she opened her mouth and I thought...<br> I thought she was going to speak.<br> You are surely one of those<br> who has given birth...<br> ...and remains in a daze<br> at what you've done.<br> - Your husband waits.<br> - Yes.<br> Jade.<br> Jade.<br> - Take care.<br> - You take care.<br> I wish you would take<br> that squealing thing from him.<br> You should get him a wife. It's time<br> he brought grandsons into this house.<br> - In time. In time.<br> - If you told him to marry...<br> ...you're not sure he would obey.<br> - So you spare yourself dealing with him.<br> - There is no need to deal with him.<br> - Shall I tell you a secret thing in your heart?<br> - No.<br> Our third son is the son you love best,<br> but most uneasily.<br> He's different from the others.<br> You fear that.<br> That's why you go on the far side<br> of an argument.<br> Our sons wait for their towels.<br> Jade. Jade, where is my towel? Jade?<br> Thank you, Jade.<br> I've not seen her since the sun<br> was in the middle of the sky.<br> The matchmaker cheated us.<br> - What? My wife is not in the house?<br> - I could not find her.<br> This comes of women having their feet free.<br> Nowadays they run around like goats.<br> - May I help you, Mother?<br> - Have you ever done so?<br> Or has your worthless one?<br> All that is done in this house, I do.<br> - At least my wife stays at home.<br> - Jade has a reason to go to the village.<br> When a woman knows a man wants her,<br> she will ever display herself.<br> That is true. Have you not seen<br> our fourth cousin look at Jade?<br> He resembles a sick cat:<br> I would beat her until she was<br> not so good to look upon.<br> If more of that were done,<br> there will be less trouble with wives.<br> Only men should make sure first<br> they are able.<br> These new-fashioned women<br> are not easily beaten.<br> I will dress and go find her.<br> Then we will see who is able.<br> Eat first, my son, and your arm<br> will be stronger for all this beating.<br> Who tries to see within our house<br> without himself being seen?<br> Are you eating, wife of my third cousin?<br> Our rice is poor and scanty.<br> And we have no pork at all.<br> - But will you share it with us?<br> - Thank you. But I cannot.<br> Are you alone, then?<br> Is my fourth cousin not here?<br> My son is not home yet.<br> But your third cousin,<br> my honored husband, is here.<br> How are you, sir? What new thing<br> have you found in your book?<br> Nothing his family can chew, swallow<br> and grow fat on, I can tell you.<br> My fourth cousin is in the city perhaps?<br> I do not know. My son<br> has been gone since the noon meal.<br> Well, I must get on.<br> I have business in the village.<br> He lies.<br> He has no business in the village<br> at this hour.<br> He looks for his wife, Jade.<br> And if he finds her with our son,<br> as he well may...<br> Jade is married to Lao Er.<br> The thing my son felt for her has ended.<br> It will never be ended<br> until one of them is dead.<br> You old book fool, it is your fault.<br> It is your fault we starve.<br> It is your fault we did not get Jade<br> for our son.<br> - Can I control a woman's choice?<br> - A woman's choice?<br> Did not your cousin Ling Tan<br> give you 30 silver dollars?<br> Did you not tell our son<br> he could not have the girl?<br> Quiet, woman. I read.<br> Out of all this,<br> something terrible will happen.<br> We are students<br> who have come from the university...<br> ...to travel through the country<br> and tell you and others like you...<br> ...news of the war in the North.<br> The Japanese march toward us.<br> These are two pictures<br> of what the Japanese are doing.<br> They are doing it now.<br> While you sit here and watch,<br> these very things are happening.<br> Shen, have you seen my fourth cousin?<br> These are your people<br> they are murdering and mine.<br> This is our country they are looting.<br> The enemy is ruthless.<br> He regards us only as slaves.<br> We cannot deal with him.<br> We must resist him.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Seeking someone perhaps?<br> - Not the one who would sit near you.<br> - If she were my wife...<br> It is with pleasure that I leave you.<br> When the Japanese reach your village...<br> ...they will come with lies in their mouths<br> and death in their hands.<br> And you must resist them,<br> even to your own deaths.<br> And beyond.<br> Are you able to do this?<br> Tell me you are.<br> All of you rise and tell me you are able.<br> We are able.<br> See? There is one who speaks.<br> Are there not others? Tell me. Come.<br> Yes. Come.<br> You come. I'm hungry.<br> The woman should have food ready<br> when her man is hungry.<br> My wife is at home where she should be.<br> Am I speaking into the wind?<br> Have you not understood<br> what you have seen and heard?<br> I know you have. Tell me you will<br> resist the enemy when he comes.<br> - How then can we resist?<br> - Can we fight machines with our hands?<br> Why do you shame me<br> by showing yourself off to everybody?<br> I come home, my belly roaring<br> like a hungry lion.<br> Why did you not eat and silence it?<br> How can I when you're not in your place?<br> I'm ashamed before my parents.<br> - I wish you'd not go in the street alone.<br> - Why?<br> - Other men will see you.<br> - I do not look.<br> I do not want them to look at you.<br> You're my wife.<br> But I cannot stay always in the courtyard.<br> These are not ancient times.<br> I wish it were those times.<br> I'd like to lock you up.<br> If you lock me up,<br> I wouldn't eat and then die.<br> I would not let you.<br> But these are the new times,<br> and I will come and go as I please.<br> - I should beat you.<br> - I have done nothing.<br> But you are not<br> where a woman should be at...<br> At home, waiting for her husband.<br> And there is this thing.<br> Before we were wed,<br> when the choice was put to you...<br> ...why did you not choose me<br> above my fourth cousin?<br> If you could choose now,<br> which would it be?<br> You both have two arms and legs,<br> and all your fingers and toes.<br> Neither of you are<br> scabby-headed, nor cross-eyed.<br> - What, then, is the difference between you?<br> - You used me very ill.<br> You look so pale and so thin.<br> You are so to be pitied, you big turnip.<br> I wish I were a man of learning.<br> I wish I knew the words to ease myself<br> so I could tell you what I feel.<br> What do you feel?<br> I know, but...<br> I do not have the words.<br> I too am not very learned.<br> Is that why<br> you do not often speak to me?<br> Two must speak for understanding.<br> If I tell you everything that is in me,<br> will you tell me all that is in you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Then tonight we will speak together?<br> Yes.<br> Fetch me my food.<br> I will eat here in the courtyard.<br> - Yes, my husband.<br> - And since you did not cook the meal...<br> ...you may clean up after it.<br> - Yes, my husband.<br> He must have beaten her.<br> I do not take too much credit to myself...<br> ...that I'm the only man in these parts<br> who can read and write.<br> But how would I find time for my books<br> if you did not send me rice...<br> ...and a new coat now and then,<br> and sometimes even meat?<br> You are a scholar and my honored cousin.<br> It is only proper<br> that your needs and comforts be supplied.<br> My land yields enough for all.<br> Orchid, it is time my grandson<br> was in his bed.<br> - Yes, my mother.<br> - But, cousin, have you ever thought of this:<br> When your time comes<br> to go into the earth yourself...<br> ...shall you divide your land<br> between your sons?<br> Yes, I have thought of that.<br> You have made a good beginning.<br> Do not spoil it.<br> Will there still be enough for all?<br> Or will they quarrel<br> because their bellies are not full?<br> As my eldest son,<br> you must answer our cousin.<br> Can this land feed three men and<br> their wives and children after I am gone?<br> It can. For I will eat less meat, if my<br> brothers will, and leave in peace with them.<br> If I have taught my sons<br> that peace is good, I am content.<br> If you had been with me today, you would<br> not speak so easily of peace, my father.<br> If it were proper for a man<br> to speak to his daughter-in-law...<br> ...l'd ask her why should not<br> peaceful men speak of peace.<br> Forgive my wife, Father, for speaking<br> so boldly, but today at the teahouse...<br> ...students came and showed<br> the magic pictures and talked.<br> They told of the war in the North<br> and how the dwarfs...<br> ...from the East Ocean islands<br> burn cities and kill our people.<br> I wonder if my daughter remembers...<br> ...when other students<br> brought the pictures of flies.<br> I remember.<br> Flies as large as water buffalo.<br> Yes, and they told us<br> they were more dangerous than tigers.<br> And everyone knows that our flies...<br> ...are as small as a grain of rice<br> and as harmless.<br> And so does it not follow<br> that today also perhaps...<br> ...both words and pictures were made<br> too large to be either truth or life?<br> Does that not quiet<br> the woman's fear of my daughter?<br> Of course it does.<br> And it is time she was in her bed.<br> But we who are men know that<br> there is killing and suffering in the North.<br> And do you not believe<br> it will come here, Father?<br> I believe something else.<br> If a man lives his life in decency<br> and as he should...<br> ...and then evil comes to him,<br> it cannot harm him.<br> And he can conquer and overcome it.<br> This, I live by.<br> And so I think do all the kinsmen<br> in our village.<br> - We are men of peace.<br> - True, true, true.<br> Also, the North is a long way from here.<br> And so is my bed, and I must get to it.<br> She still is not cured.<br> Wait 500 heartbeats. Then go to her.<br> I will have my shadow<br> to walk home with.<br> Yes, the moon is round tonight<br> and the color of a ripe peach.<br> I have read that the Earth, too, is round.<br> You have told me that<br> but one thing troubles me.<br> How is it then if the world is round<br> that men on the bottom side can walk?<br> Everything is opposite there.<br> Children are born<br> with white hair and blue eyes.<br> Scholars begin to the write<br> from the wrong side of the page...<br> ...and youth is admired instead of age.<br> So why can we not believe they walk<br> with their heads hanging down?<br> And enjoy it too.<br> Old woman, have you ever thought<br> that somewhere very far below...<br> ...the spot where we stand,<br> our land goes on and on...<br> ...until at last a stranger stands on it?<br> And plants seed and takes his harvest<br> from it as though it were his own?<br> But it is not. It is ours.<br> And our sons' after us.<br> Yes, the land is ours<br> as deep as it goes beneath our feet.<br> And the stars above our heads belong to us,<br> and whatever there is beyond them.<br> But I'm troubled<br> about that stranger on our land.<br> Somewhere he reaps his grain<br> without telling you.<br> - You should ask him for rent.<br> - That I would do.<br> I would have the law on him<br> if I knew how to tell him so.<br> Do not be troubled, my son.<br> It is often good to beat a woman.<br> Oh, yes. Yes, my mother.<br> Old man, there is something here and now<br> that troubles me.<br> It is Jade.<br> Orchid is stupid<br> but she does what I tell her to do.<br> While Jade...<br> I do not think I like her.<br> Do you know why? Because<br> she is the same as you are yourself.<br> No man can tell what will come out of her.<br> And here is another thing:<br> Our second son will never tire of her<br> as I have never tired of you.<br> This is the first time<br> I found you waiting for me.<br> Who will speak first, then?<br> You. Ask me what you will.<br> Well, then...<br> What are you thinking all day?<br> I think 20 and 30 things at a time.<br> My thoughts are like a chain,<br> and one is fast to the other.<br> - But what are they?<br> - I think of the bird and how it flies.<br> And why is it I cannot lift myself<br> above the earth.<br> But now, what are you thinking now?<br> Now?<br> I think nothing.<br> Well, then...<br> ...what did you think of me<br> the first time you saw me?<br> - I cannot remember.<br> - No, I mean... I mean...<br> ...after we were married.<br> I was glad you were taller than I.<br> For a woman, I am too tall.<br> No, you are not.<br> Then what did you think?<br> And then I wondered<br> what you thought of me.<br> But you knew that I wanted you.<br> - And then I wondered...<br> - Yes?<br> I wondered if you would give me<br> the thing I would have.<br> Tell me. I will buy it for you.<br> Buy?<br> Perhaps all the things I want<br> cannot be bought.<br> All women like presents.<br> Tell me what it is.<br> I want...<br> Earrings.<br> Yes, that is it. A pair of earrings.<br> I will buy them for you tomorrow.<br> - Now have I made you happy?<br> - Yes.<br> No. You have not made me happy.<br> I do not want earrings.<br> But there is something that can be bought<br> that I would have.<br> - Buy me a book.<br> - A book?<br> - But you cannot read.<br> - I can read.<br> - Women like you never read.<br> - I learned.<br> A word or two at a time. My brother<br> could read and I learned from him.<br> A little every day.<br> But I have no book of my own.<br> I never thought to see a woman read<br> in this house.<br> There must be changes even in a household<br> if there is to be life and growth.<br> I do not know that.<br> My mother and my father have done well.<br> - But they are of the old. We are of the new.<br> - Oh, I am not sure if I am of the new.<br> I will buy you the book.<br> - You are angry?<br> - There is no room in my mind for anger.<br> It is...<br> It is just that I do not understand.<br> - Ten thousand greetings, Mr. Chow.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You are well, young sir?<br> - Yes.<br> - I would see my brother-in-law, Wu Lien.<br> - He is within. He takes his morning rest.<br> Are all asleep in this house?<br> I greet you, my brother-in-law.<br> And your honored mother.<br> Welcome, welcome. Sit down.<br> Here's your second brother,<br> mother of my children.<br> - Sit down, sit down.<br> - Thanks.<br> Well, then, you're a farmer<br> and one who looks it.<br> The dirt is still beneath your fingernails.<br> My brother, how are the old ones<br> and all of the others?<br> - Well, thank you.<br> - Tell me...<br> ...is my sister-in-law, Jade,<br> with child yet?<br> Can it be you take no interest?<br> It would seem<br> you take interest enough for both.<br> - My interest will never make him a father.<br> - No.<br> But you are hungry. I can tell.<br> In each generation,<br> a city man should do as I have done.<br> Take for a wife<br> a woman from the country.<br> Thus the line...<br> Thus the line is kept strong and hard.<br> And here is the proof of your wisdom.<br> Brother-in-law?<br> Will you dip into your wisdom<br> and tell me a thing?<br> - Yeah?<br> - I know you're a man who reads.<br> Yes. Yes, I read.<br> Often in the winter to warm my blood.<br> Sometimes in the summer to cool it.<br> If you were to buy a book,<br> what book would it be?<br> Well, there are books for every need.<br> If a man wishes to read secretly<br> for his own private pleasure...<br> ...there are books for that.<br> No? Well then,<br> for what is your book wanted?<br> I married my woman thinking her<br> like any other one and...<br> Now I find out she can read<br> and wants a book.<br> So.<br> You're only a woman,<br> mother of my children...<br> ...but if you could read,<br> what would you like to read?<br> - I never thought...<br> - I have thought of the one.<br> It has everything in it. The good prosper<br> and the wicked are punished.<br> The name of the book<br> is All Men Are Brothers.<br> - Thank you. I will remember what you...<br> - Sir.<br> Sir. Sir, there is something.<br> - As before?<br> - Worse than before. Much louder, sir.<br> They said they have warned you many times<br> and their patience is at an end.<br> These students cause trouble.<br> An honest merchant<br> cannot live in peace these times.<br> Well, what is this?<br> We ask you once more,<br> do not deal with the Japanese.<br> We're at war. You cannot buy and sell<br> Japanese goods and call yourself a patriot.<br> Do you ask me<br> to stop breathing in and out?<br> There's a call for these,<br> and a profit in them.<br> Save your breath for arguments<br> you can win.<br> Then we must speak to you<br> in words you can hear.<br> - Leave nothing.<br> - Stop. You are vandals. Stop.<br> Destroy all Japanese goods.<br> We must make him understand<br> what he has done.<br> Bandits. Thieves.<br> You'll pay for this. Thieves.<br> This is the only way to make him see.<br> What's happens here will happen<br> to every shop that sells Japanese goods.<br> No. No.<br> Wu Lien walks hand in hand<br> with those who deal in your blood.<br> I'm only a merchant.<br> Why do you destroy my goods?<br> He pays for Japanese goods in money<br> that'll come back to us in pain and death.<br> No, no, I deal only in innocent things<br> that harm no one.<br> This man, Wu Lien,<br> loves his cash box above his country.<br> That is not true. That's not true.<br> Turn away from this traitor<br> as you would turn from the Japanese.<br> Come.<br> How can you say that?<br> Can it be that the thing<br> I have done all my life...<br> ...is now held against me as a crime?<br> Did you see...?<br> Did you see those merchants<br> turn away from me as from a bad odor?<br> - They are of my own kind.<br> - Be of stout heart, my brother. It will pass.<br> No, no, I do not think it will<br> and I'm not a stupid man.<br> I must turn this thing over in my mind.<br> Decide what to do in the days I see ahead.<br> I must think and weigh what comes out.<br> And think again.<br> And then this strange young man<br> jumped down, ran away and was gone.<br> - Was he a bandit, then?<br> - No, it was said he was a student.<br> First you encounter this trouble<br> and then you buy a book.<br> This book that Jade now has, what is it?<br> - Books have names.<br> - So has this one.<br> - It is called All Men Are Brothers.<br> - All Men Are Brothers?<br> What of the stranger who lives<br> on the other side of the earth...<br> ...and reaps his grain on my land?<br> Is he my brother? I think not.<br> Today I pulled a turnip.<br> They grow small this year.<br> Can it be this strange brother is<br> pulling at the roots to plague us?<br> It's good to have him to blame.<br> A book. And Jade can read in it.<br> You see? An idea spreads. A book.<br> I have said and say again it is wrong<br> to give a woman such a dangerous thing.<br> It is unnatural<br> and mine will never have one.<br> What if a child comes? What will your<br> woman do if she has not finished the book?<br> Will she read on<br> and let the child be born anyhow?<br> She will manage.<br> The day has been full.<br> There's work tomorrow.<br> Yes, my son.<br> Your eyes are heavy with weariness.<br> Your wife waits for you, brother,<br> with a book in her hands.<br> Even a book can be closed<br> and put away.<br> It is but a book,<br> and yet it keeps your eyes from me.<br> Come sit beside me.<br> I will tell you what I have read.<br> How shall I know if you read truly?<br> You will know I could not make up<br> such things.<br> In this place, it tells what happens<br> when men know only greed.<br> It tells how peace is then lost,<br> and what men may do to each other.<br> It is magic.<br> Your eyes pick up those bird tracks<br> and your eyes give them to your voice...<br> ...and your voice gives them to my ears.<br> And here,<br> it tells how then there is killing...<br> ...and fighting and even torture.<br> Oh, it is wrong to torture.<br> - That is what it says.<br> - It is magic.<br> You do not listen.<br> I try.<br> You must try harder.<br> Money was spent for this book.<br> We must not waste it.<br> We must waste nothing<br> that is given to us.<br> Neither money,<br> nor the hours we have together.<br> I cannot read<br> when you keep watching me.<br> Since I cannot look at the book<br> and know what it means...<br> ...I must look at you...<br> ...so the money will not be wasted,<br> and nothing else.<br> Then I will teach you to read.<br> There is word here...<br> ...of how men must rise up and resist<br> the things that make them weak.<br> That is advice I cannot take.<br> Can you?<br> Well, you will not listen.<br> And now you place the book<br> where my hand cannot reach it.<br> - Shall I put it back within your grasp?<br> - Yes.<br> No.<br> I will rest my eyes now.<br> I will teach you to read another time.<br> I will remind you<br> when I'm ready for reading.<br> Let the gods forgive me for saying this<br> but I am wicked.<br> I love you more than I love my father<br> and my mother.<br> I am more wicked than you.<br> I want to hear you tell me this.<br> If there were food enough<br> only for them or for you...<br> ...I would give it to you<br> and let them starve.<br> You turn to me of your own will,<br> and it is the first time this has been so.<br> Yes, for this night, you have told me<br> the thing my heart needed to hear.<br> Now I know that you'll care<br> what I think and feel, and what I am.<br> Not only that I give you children<br> and make your food.<br> I know that I'm not only to belong<br> to your house...<br> ...but I am to be yours.<br> And I am content.<br> You're late.<br> Did you once more have trouble...<br> ...escaping my mother's eyes?<br> From this day on,<br> I will come to you openly.<br> She will say nothing.<br> I cannot believe my mother<br> will change that much.<br> No. But I have changed.<br> Do you not see it?<br> Your eyes are as soft.<br> Your hair as pleasant to my touch.<br> No, I cannot see this change...<br> ...and I do not wish a change.<br> It is within me.<br> But it is so great<br> I thought it must show on my face.<br> What is the cause of this great difference?<br> And when did it begin?<br> On the night we first opened our hearts<br> to each other, my husband.<br> Even if it is only a girl,<br> I shall be very happy.<br> We shall be ancestors?<br> - Oh, it will be a son.<br> - I shall ask the gods for one.<br> But if it is only a girl,<br> she still will be welcome?<br> If you're her mother,<br> she will be welcome.<br> And she will be taught to read...<br> ...even if her father is always too busy<br> with lesser things.<br> Where would this upstart daughter be...<br> ...if I did not busy myself<br> with those lesser things?<br> Oh, this is a good moment.<br> The best in my life so far.<br> - Something falls.<br> - It shines like silver.<br> Look at the earth. It's a black fountain.<br> A hole big enough to bury 50 men.<br> And smokes still comes from it.<br> If one of us had stood near here,<br> he would no longer live.<br> I've wanted to dig a pond on my land<br> for 10 years, and here it is.<br> It would be better if the barbarians<br> did use the sky ships...<br> ...to dig ponds and wells.<br> - Maybe it is an idea.<br> - Look. Look, rolling smoke.<br> It was the same in the magic pictures.<br> There are many fires over the city wall<br> and small ones outside.<br> - Flying ships come out of the smoke.<br> - What shall we do?<br> Someone of us should go to the city.<br> My... My wife thinks of our elder sister<br> and what happens to her.<br> We should all think of that. I'll go.<br> I would not be hasty, cousin.<br> If it is good news, it will not spoil.<br> The more slowly one hears bad news,<br> the better.<br> My woman wouldn't let me rest<br> if I didn't go, nor could I rest.<br> - Let me go in your place.<br> - All right, go quickly.<br> Do what you can. The rest of us<br> should go back to our work.<br> Can it be our son at last?<br> I'm afraid to believe it is.<br> We're all but dead. We're all but dead.<br> We might have been killed<br> had we been 10 feet nearer to street.<br> There was such noise.<br> There was such noise.<br> The shop half gone.<br> We have nothing<br> but our bare lives in our hands.<br> We're lost. All is lost. All.<br> All day the flying ships came.<br> And everywhere the silver eggs dropped,<br> they burst the buildings into dust.<br> And the shops<br> and all the goods within are waste.<br> - But what of the people?<br> - The people...<br> Into pieces,<br> as if they were made of clay.<br> - Here an arm, there a head, there a piece...<br> - But why? Why?<br> How can men do this to other men?<br> The sky is over us all.<br> Our own servants<br> and the clerks are dead.<br> And one such an honest young man.<br> Where shall we find one like him again?<br> What is the use, even of an honest man,<br> if there's no shop to put him in?<br> Our shops, our goods, gone, all gone.<br> I'm a man who can prosper only in peace.<br> Can it be those students who cried out<br> spoke the truth?<br> The truth? Now, what is the truth?<br> Each men sees it differently.<br> The truth I see<br> is that the East Ocean people will come...<br> ...and enter the city, and the city will fall.<br> - Yes, and so will the nation.<br> - Can that be?<br> The nation is only the people,<br> and we are the people.<br> - And while we remain, so does the nation.<br> - We're not strong enough.<br> Why are we not strong enough?<br> Why do we not have things to kill with too?<br> They have no use to people like us<br> who love only to live.<br> Then we will die.<br> Death is each men's natural end,<br> and that I know. But not this kind.<br> This is beyond the mind of man<br> unless he sees it for himself.<br> That I must do.<br> Hurry. It is my husband.<br> He's here beneath this rubbish.<br> It is his hand! I would know it anywhere.<br> Oh, my God!<br> It is too much to bear,<br> and I do not blame you.<br> We must see what can be done here.<br> Come.<br> Our village has become an island<br> in a river of fleeing people.<br> But they cannot run fast enough<br> to forget the horror behind them.<br> My grandfather will speak to you now.<br> I know that you are looking to me<br> to save you from this great trouble.<br> I've been trying to find a way<br> but I cannot.<br> I cannot save myself.<br> I know that what today was<br> will be again tomorrow.<br> You, my three sons, are men.<br> And you, Wu Lien, are older than they.<br> - If you have anything to say, then say it.<br> - I...<br> I have not yet thought of any way<br> to save any of us.<br> There are two things which can be done.<br> One is to escape the evil<br> by running away.<br> And the other is to let it come down<br> and bear it.<br> In this, my father,<br> I ask, what will you do yourself?<br> Stay here where I was born<br> and where I have lived.<br> Then I say I will do what you do.<br> I, too, will stay.<br> But I, my father, will escape it.<br> I will say nothing to any who do go.<br> Let those who will stay with me,<br> and those who would go, let them go.<br> You blame me, my father?<br> No, no. I do not blame you, my son.<br> Then do as I will do. Leave this place.<br> If I could roll up my land like a cloth<br> and take it with me...<br> ...but that is impossible. No.<br> No. I stay, my son. You are free to go.<br> I do not run away because I'm afraid.<br> I only fear for my coming child.<br> A grandchild?<br> That is good news, my son.<br> And I think it well that you go.<br> When will you leave us, brother?<br> We have yet time.<br> We will wait until we find those<br> we would go with.<br> I do not like this talk. I do not see<br> why Jade should be taken away.<br> It is only that I may finish<br> what I was made to do, my mother.<br> But who will look after you<br> when your time comes?<br> Why should our grandson be born<br> somewhere in a field like an animal?<br> It may be better that they go.<br> We do not know what lies ahead.<br> Strange feet may enter our gate.<br> If my son wants to go, he will go.<br> But let Jade stay.<br> - Her duty to you comes first.<br> - I think it does not.<br> A woman should go with her man.<br> There are so many who flee<br> these past weeks.<br> The whole face of the earth<br> must be changing.<br> Cousin, what comes now?<br> These carry different burdens.<br> Move along!<br> Move along!<br> Keep to the road!<br> What foolishness is this?<br> Only a city man would break his back<br> under the weight of iron...<br> ...when he might carry a bag of rice.<br> Why did you not take two wheels<br> and make a cart and ride?<br> Look at those fools.<br> They will eat iron if they eat at all.<br> This is not iron, my wise country friend.<br> This is a factory we carry on our backs.<br> And you may as well<br> get used to seeing such things...<br> ...for a whole city follows behind us.<br> These are not as the others were.<br> They seem to have a plan.<br> - Halt!<br> - Halt!<br> - We will rest now for a little while.<br> - Halt!<br> - Rest!<br> - Rest!<br> I've never been so tired.<br> Why do you not sleep here in our land?<br> There is water, and we will share<br> what we can with you.<br> You are good to us as all have been,<br> or we could not have come this far.<br> We will rest here tonight with these,<br> our friends.<br> These are the people we will join,<br> my father.<br> Yes. They are the ones<br> we have waited for.<br> They are strong and full of courage.<br> I would ask you, my friend,<br> where do you go?<br> Our eyes are on the mountains,<br> a thousand miles from here.<br> What will you do there, sir?<br> We'll set up these machines we carry,<br> and they will be a factory.<br> Then we'll make bullets and guns<br> for the army.<br> Where is our brave army now?<br> They fight between you<br> and the Japanese.<br> Many thousands of them have already died<br> to delay the evil dwarfs from coming here.<br> My son would join you in your journey<br> if he is welcome.<br> We would be happy<br> to take something of yours with us.<br> And what is a man without his wife?<br> I, too, am strong and can be of help.<br> You are welcome also.<br> The wind has brought rain.<br> It is good for our land...<br> ...but is it not bad for travelers?<br> - If it helps you, then it must help us.<br> Now that we are to go,<br> I wonder if it's too far.<br> I will be on my feet when others drop.<br> - I wish I could carry the child for you.<br> - One of these days you shall.<br> I never thought a child of mine<br> would be born anywhere...<br> ...except here on this land.<br> He will find a place of his own.<br> It is very meaningful to a man<br> where he is born.<br> We must mark the place.<br> A man begins his life before he is born.<br> So, what better place to mark for him<br> than our tree.<br> There. Now it will be his also.<br> All right, take your places!<br> - Take you places.<br> - Take your places!<br> We must cross those hills<br> before the midday rest.<br> Take your places!<br> I've looked everywhere<br> but I cannot find our mother...<br> ...to say goodbye.<br> Tell her it is our sorrow<br> that we could not find her.<br> I will tell her.<br> You must not keep your friends waiting.<br> Send me word somehow<br> when the child is born.<br> If it is a boy,<br> send a red cord in the envelope.<br> If it is a girl, let it be a blue one.<br> Remember, my child...<br> ...that the woman is a root,<br> and the man the tree.<br> The tree grows only as high<br> as the root is strong.<br> I will remember, my father.<br> Go.<br> This place is yours.<br> - March!<br> - March!<br> So this is where you have been.<br> They looked for you.<br> I would not come to see him go.<br> Pulling, straining like an ox<br> and bawling like one.<br> - You have been weeping.<br> - I have not.<br> Splashed water on my face.<br> He looked so small beside the others.<br> He did not.<br> He was the largest by far.<br> You are the best mother in the province.<br> Where is there one better beyond the seas?<br> I'm a fool.<br> I miss them already. Even Jade.<br> Yes, yes, some sort of strength<br> has left the house with their going.<br> I would not say I want them back.<br> They want to go, they go.<br> I would not have you a cool, thin soul.<br> I like you hot-tempered and gusty.<br> You old turnip.<br> Come here, old man.<br> Let me see that spot on your neck.<br> - See if you have boil after all these years...<br> - It's where a mosquito bit me.<br> Do not tell me what it is.<br> I can see for myself.<br> Well, can you not<br> catch a mosquito anymore?<br> Must you be bitten like a child?<br> You're clumsy.<br> I like your quick tongue<br> even when it is turned on me.<br> Old woman, I tell you this.<br> If you should die before I die,<br> even then I would not marry another.<br> For after you, any would be<br> like a carrot dried without salt.<br> The guns of the enemy came ever closer.<br> And still the people fled before them.<br> Some of the kinsmen of Ling Tan<br> fled also.<br> But most of them stayed<br> and went into the fields to reap the grain.<br> And each man helped his neighbor...<br> ... for the harvest was at hand,<br> and they were farmers.<br> And war or no war, they knew<br> they must bring their food from the earth...<br> ... so that whatever came,<br> they could feed their families.<br> Day after day, the flying ships came...<br> ... and then flew on and bombed the city.<br> The people of the valley of Ling<br> were afraid.<br> But they stopped only to look up<br> and then turn back to their work...<br> ... for they'd heard<br> that the Japanese had taken the land...<br> ... a hundred miles deep from the sea...<br> ... and were even now<br> approaching the nearby city.<br> Time, too, had become their enemy.<br> It seemed nature itself was against them.<br> The rains were early that year.<br> And the farmers fought the wind<br> and the water as they always had.<br> Here was a thing they understood<br> and, understanding, could defeat.<br> But they could not defeat the fear<br> that was in them.<br> For always in their ears was the sound<br> of the bombardment.<br> A sound that was louder now...<br> ... and they knew that the enemy<br> was storming the gates of the city.<br> Then the day came.<br> The day that Ling Tan dreaded<br> above all others.<br> The guns were silent...<br> ... and the flying ships<br> were gone from the air.<br> I fear this quiet more<br> than the noise of battle.<br> It does not mean peace.<br> It means but one thing,<br> and we must face it.<br> The defenders of our city<br> have been overcome.<br> And even now as I speak to you,<br> the enemy is at our gates.<br> - Within hours, they will be upon us.<br> - That is true.<br> The enemy moves swiftly,<br> and we have no arms.<br> How can we resist him?<br> Are we to fight him with our hands?<br> I speak for myself<br> but you are welcome to listen.<br> We cannot stop the Japanese, no.<br> But as soon as they have<br> occupied a city...<br> ...I believe we shall be able<br> to deal with them.<br> How can you say this?<br> I bought and sold their goods<br> as did my father before me...<br> ...and I have found no great evil<br> in the face they turned to me.<br> I did find evil in my own people,<br> in green boys...<br> ...who burned my goods without reason.<br> Wu Lien, if when they come, you are right,<br> I will say you are.<br> But even if you are not, what can we do<br> but take their rule for ours also?<br> All we want is peace<br> and to be left alone to live.<br> - Our time is short. What is the plan?<br> - How shall we meet them?<br> How can we show them<br> what is in our hearts?<br> What ways do we know but our own?<br> Let us do what we would do...<br> ...for any new ruler coming to our village,<br> but let us keep our pride.<br> But they are machines.<br> How can you talk to machines<br> when they're belching smoke?<br> - Speak, here is the enemy.<br> - Do not use that word.<br> Sirs...<br> Sirs, I am come...<br> We are come, sirs...<br> Sir, we are only farmers...<br> ...a small merchant or two,<br> and my cousin here the scholar.<br> - We are men of peace and reason...<br> - Where is your inn, farmer?<br> - Lead us there.<br> - But...<br> Waiter. Waiter. Service for my soldiers.<br> You there, line up against the wall.<br> - Steady, now. Give us no trouble.<br> - Let's get out of here.<br> Get him over here, right now.<br> - You are ill, my father.<br> - No, no, no. It's nothing.<br> - Wine with it.<br> - Wine, wine.<br> Over here.<br> - Wine.<br> - Bring the wine or we'll shoot you.<br> Tea. We want wine, not tea.<br> - Wine?<br> - Yes, wine.<br> We... We have no wine.<br> We have that only on feast days.<br> Oh, no wine, huh?<br> And where are your women?<br> There are other things than wine.<br> Women.<br> Bring them. Bring me a young one.<br> I do not care if mine is young or not.<br> What matters so long as they are...<br> Does anyone else care to run?<br> We have wine in our homes. Good wine.<br> We will have our women bring it to you.<br> See that they do, then.<br> No, do not stop.<br> Get to your homes.<br> Old woman. Old woman.<br> Get the household together inside<br> quickly. The enemy comes.<br> Orchid, eldest daughter, all of you.<br> - What?<br> - Bring the children.<br> - Lao San, my son.<br> - What of the speech?<br> Our mouths spoke<br> into the mouths of guns.<br> Come with me.<br> You must scatter over the lands.<br> Each man look after his own.<br> My third son, his mother.<br> I'll stay with the house.<br> - I'll stay by you.<br> - No, you cannot.<br> - I'll climb the rafters and hide there.<br> - Then I'll climb also.<br> They come by the road.<br> - Mother.<br> - Oh, no, no, wait.<br> No, this way.<br> They will see us there.<br> We must hide. Find the hole in the wall.<br> Here. My son.<br> Orchid. Take the baby.<br> Come, my son, you must be brave.<br> We will be soon be safe.<br> Safety. Where is safety?<br> Mother, please. Please, Mother.<br> She can go no further.<br> - Go. I will do my best for your mother.<br> - Yes. Yes, I...<br> - My mother.<br> - Remember...<br> ...let each look out for those in his charge<br> and pay no heed to the others.<br> We must hide safely,<br> and each group to itself.<br> Yes, yes. Then if one is found,<br> only they perish.<br> Go. We must hide you. Quiet, quiet.<br> Do not move. Do not speak.<br> We will not be far away.<br> - Old man, hermit.<br> - The door is locked.<br> Our old dog. They will kill him.<br> Take what you want and destroy the rest.<br> Is there anything here worth having?<br> All of them are gone.<br> No one is in the house.<br> You will stay here, my eldest son,<br> like a man and by yourself.<br> Lie down,<br> make yourself small against the ground.<br> And you here, my wife.<br> Do not move for anything.<br> Where will you go?<br> Back a little, between you<br> and the evil thing there.<br> Yes, my husband.<br> You tremble.<br> Your nose twitches like a little rabbit.<br> Come, do not waste time here.<br> Find the farmer.<br> Search the courtyard.<br> And the first woman we find<br> belongs with me.<br> Is there a way out of this courtyard?<br> Here. Here's a hole in the wall.<br> Pull aside the vine.<br> Someone has crawled through here.<br> Come, see what I found.<br> Something they left behind.<br> No wonder. Look at it.<br> Here is the first woman<br> and she belongs to you.<br> No. She is old.<br> There are the young to think of.<br> Do not be afraid.<br> My husband.<br> My husband.<br> Come, my son,<br> we'll be safer in another place.<br> I heard a child.<br> Where there is a child,<br> there is a woman.<br> Remember, a little man does not cry out.<br> No matter what he sees.<br> The sounds of death are far away now.<br> My good red pigskin boxes...<br> ...that I brought here as a bride.<br> Come, old woman.<br> There's worse to see in the courtyard.<br> Wait here.<br> Do not spare me what you must see.<br> Someone comes.<br> Is anybody here?<br> It's our third son.<br> Mother. Father.<br> - You are safe.<br> - Yes, yes, we are safe.<br> We're safe.<br> Where's your brother and his family?<br> I don't know. We lost each other<br> and did not come together again.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Where are the others?<br> We met people who told us it was safe<br> in the foreign school in the city.<br> - My sister and her children are there.<br> - Where then is Wu Lien?<br> Perhaps he stayed in safety<br> with our daughter.<br> He went back to his shop<br> and he will stay there, he said.<br> But how he can, I do not know.<br> The women, little children.<br> Streets run with their blood.<br> In the village, the young women<br> are dead in the grass.<br> And no one knows<br> how many others still live...<br> ...but would be better dead.<br> Oh, what I have seen this night.<br> Oh, I cannot. I cannot.<br> There, there, my meat dumpling.<br> She was ever a poor, foolish little thing,<br> without courage.<br> But she was my wife.<br> And the mother of my children.<br> I cannot stay here. I cannot.<br> Quiet, my son. This is your home.<br> No longer. I hate it.<br> I do not care where I go,<br> but I cannot stay here.<br> I will go with those in the hills<br> who fight this horror.<br> Rest today first. Do not think of it now.<br> I cannot rest. I must go.<br> Help our third son<br> make ready for his journey.<br> Remember, my son,<br> all weeping ceases at last.<br> Your brother's rash and foolish,<br> and I will keep an eye on him.<br> If not my own, then one that I can trust.<br> I would have you follow him to the hills<br> and watch over him for me.<br> - Do you so command me, Father?<br> - I do.<br> The hills.<br> There I, too, could fight.<br> Yes, I can pay these dwarfs<br> some of what I owe them.<br> I could kill them like lice in a winter coat.<br> Since this time yesterday, cousin,<br> we have both lost sons.<br> - Can a cock still crow?<br> - It does not seem one should.<br> I feel there is no tomorrow.<br> Come in. Come in, sirs.<br> - Salted fish.<br> - Fish, yes. Yes, sir.<br> Here, here is fish. Oh, no.<br> What...?<br> I'm of all creatures,<br> the most unfortunate.<br> These fish are not salted. No, no, sir.<br> They are only soaked in oil.<br> - I will take them.<br> - Then take them as a gift, please.<br> I bought them from your country<br> and now I return them to you.<br> - Thank you. You are Wu Lien?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - And you do not hate us?<br> - Why, no. I hate no one, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> For all this damage we are sorry.<br> - Our soldiers very brave, angry.<br> - Oh, yes, I know. I know how soldiers are.<br> But now... Now let us hope for peace.<br> Only in peace can we do business.<br> I am glad to meet a man<br> who hates no one.<br> What can I say except that<br> whatever you want me to do I will do.<br> You maybe useful to us, if you will.<br> Will I not be...?<br> We shall set up<br> a people's government here.<br> And those who rule, shall rule for us.<br> Can you read and write?<br> Oh, certainly, sir. I'm a man of culture.<br> - You know the address written there?<br> - Yes. Yes, sir.<br> I have delivered goods there.<br> It is the house of a very rich man.<br> And now he shares it with us,<br> his friends.<br> You will come there tomorrow.<br> And live there.<br> You'll see how merciful we are<br> with those who do not resist us.<br> Yes.<br> Our flag above your door<br> will protect you until you come to us.<br> All my thanks, great one.<br> Oh, even to 10,000 thousand.<br> I'm more cheered than I've been for months.<br> Now I can be with my household again.<br> How wise am I<br> to arrange my own affairs so well.<br> - Another patriot has died.<br> - Patriot. What, then, is a patriot?<br> To be one must a man die<br> and let the worms eat his flesh?<br> No, no, no. I think not.<br> All these thing that happen<br> are not my affair.<br> Whatever comes, I'm a man of peace.<br> And whatever heaven sends<br> I will take and go on with my business.<br> If this foolish resistance will stop<br> there will be peace.<br> Do you not agree?<br> Farmer, this country now belongs to us,<br> your conquerors.<br> You must produce on your land<br> as we say.<br> And the harvest is to come to us<br> at the price we tell you it shall be.<br> And those who disobey us<br> will need their land no longer.<br> - But they take all the fish. The pond is mine.<br> - Nothing is yours.<br> Will you village men never learn<br> that you are conquered?<br> If they take all the rice,<br> how can we live and plant in the spring?<br> You can live off your own fat and you<br> will be given seed when the time come.<br> You don't even leave us breeding stock.<br> We will raise the animals henceforth<br> and also eat them.<br> My ox. Who will pull the plow?<br> Your own back looks strong.<br> How would we feed<br> our grandchildren now?<br> - Why did you not defy him?<br> - Alive, I can hold my land.<br> Dead, I can only hold so much<br> as I am buried in.<br> So while Ling Tan and his kinsmen<br> tried somehow to live on...<br> ... those who had taken machines apart<br> with their hands...<br> ... so they could be carried piece by piece,<br> were making their way forward.<br> Mud could not stop them. Nor could rain.<br> Rain that so filled the air<br> that fish could have lived in it.<br> Mud so thick that it held them back<br> like evil hands.<br> Water was made to cross<br> and it was crossed many times.<br> And when it could not be walked in,<br> boats were built.<br> And the people rowed upon the water.<br> And were grateful for the moment<br> that they need not walk.<br> Time came when the earth opened<br> at their feet...<br> ... but they did not stop.<br> They took what they had, rags and belts<br> and ropes, and made bridges...<br> ... and passed over.<br> And then they reached<br> the high mountain passes...<br> ... where no one had gone before.<br> And many faltered, for food was gone<br> and strength was near an end.<br> Many faltered but did not stop.<br> Nothing could stop them<br> but their own will.<br> Nor could it stop Jade and Lao Er.<br> Although now and then, they rested...<br> ... and she yearned<br> for the end of the journey...<br> ... for she knew<br> that her time was at hand.<br> The enemy was everywhere,<br> leaving footprints on the sick earth...<br> ... and many of Ling Tan's kinsmen died.<br> Some met death quickly<br> but they were the fortunate ones.<br> For others found a longer,<br> harder way to die.<br> And then starvation came,<br> and pestilence...<br> ... and did not spare<br> the house of Ling Tan.<br> The little children were struck down<br> for they were the weakest.<br> So Ling Tan and his wife<br> went into the fields...<br> ... to dig for roots<br> and forgotten kernels of grain.<br> All about them<br> were the other people of the valley.<br> And the hunger pain in their bellies<br> drove some of them mad...<br> ... and they became as animals<br> and fought each other.<br> Some of them fell upon their knees...<br> ... and fought for swill<br> that not even swine would eat...<br> ... while the enemy laughed.<br> But still, Ling Tan and others like him<br> clung to their land.<br> Old woman?<br> I have found food for them.<br> Girl is dead.<br> But the boy... There is food.<br> We can help him.<br> It's too late. He is past all help.<br> What is a house where no children are?<br> They brought only happiness<br> and they have taken it away.<br> What need<br> could the gods have of them?<br> That should I go on living<br> when my grandchildren die.<br> Curse all these men<br> who would make wars.<br> Curse all women<br> who give birth to these men.<br> And curse their grandmothers<br> and all who are their kin.<br> Why do not men of peace and sense<br> band together...<br> ...and forbid life<br> to those who would make wars?<br> Yet what can I do?<br> One man upon my land.<br> Cousin, cousin? Are you here, then?<br> Cousin, are you here, then?<br> Cousin, cousin? Where is the man?<br> I come with big news in my mouth.<br> See. See, they have food<br> and did not share it.<br> This is from your son.<br> A messenger brought it to the teahouse.<br> A letter from a son<br> is something I will never have now.<br> We have all lost much.<br> Well, then, open it.<br> The cord is red.<br> - It is a son.<br> - We have a grandson.<br> But you weep. This is a time for joy.<br> Two grandchildren lie dead in our house.<br> Shall I thank heaven<br> for sending us back but one?<br> Quiet, woman, or heaven will hear you<br> and take even him away.<br> Thank you, cousin.<br> This news lightens our heavy hearts.<br> A grandson is no small thing.<br> By rights, this child of Jade's<br> is not yours.<br> You talk with no thought.<br> Pray excuse her.<br> Bitterness has turned her words to gall.<br> Had Jade married my son as she ought...<br> ...he would be alive today<br> and safe there with her.<br> And so before the gods,<br> her child is our grandchild.<br> I should drive you from my house...<br> ...but it would soil this moment.<br> This joyful moment.<br> But not even the enemy<br> could stop the seasons.<br> And at last it was spring.<br> And each farmer was given grain.<br> Not to eat, but to plant.<br> And it was said that each seed<br> was counted...<br> ... and the man would answer for it<br> if each seed did not yield.<br> So Ling Tan harnessed himself<br> to his plow like an ox.<br> And together, he and his old woman<br> felt the earth turn beneath their feet.<br> The grain grew straight and tall.<br> But Ling Tan and his wife could no longer<br> take pleasure in it's promise...<br> ... for they knew that what they worked for<br> would not be theirs.<br> Now what, old woman? Has the enemy<br> not done enough damage to my house?<br> Must you dig up the foundations?<br> We will keep our seed<br> and the vegetables we grow...<br> ...and hide them in this hole.<br> - I will make it big enough to hold a pig.<br> - What pig?<br> The one you'll steal<br> from the enemy's breeding farm.<br> But it will have to be big.<br> How can you dig such a thing without help.<br> The earth is stubborn.<br> Heaven gave me the thought.<br> Heaven will provide the help.<br> The shovel is there.<br> We will steal food from ourselves<br> and eat it.<br> I am too just a man to deny sense<br> even to a woman, when I hear it from her.<br> If all do this, we'll harry the enemy<br> like fleas in a dog's tail.<br> And it may be that he will make little<br> headway for stopping to gnaw at his rear.<br> - My son.<br> - My father.<br> Oh, what gladness.<br> My mother.<br> Have I no grandson?<br> Where is he? Where is he?<br> Quiet, woman. Before you burst,<br> and the enemy hears the sound you make.<br> Where have you left<br> my little dumpling?<br> Books, still books.<br> You've crushed him beneath them.<br> You seem to love them<br> more than you love your child.<br> How sweet his flesh smells.<br> Bring the lamp close so I can see him.<br> Oh, my little meat dumpling.<br> Oh, how firm he is of body,<br> and his hair like black silk.<br> He's exactly as I thought he would be.<br> I knew you'd bring him back to me.<br> I knew. I knew.<br> Else I could not have lived.<br> Night after night,<br> I've dreamed of holding him like this.<br> Guard you heart, old woman.<br> Guard your heart.<br> Yes, my mother, too much joy<br> is as bad as too much sorrow.<br> Here, my mother, drink down this cold tea.<br> Then the words can come out.<br> Why, this is no usual child.<br> Look at his face, how square it is.<br> And he has a square mouth.<br> - Now give him back to me.<br> - In a moment, old woman. In a moment.<br> What can the enemy do to us<br> when our family goes on like this?<br> There, now.<br> You are in your home and you must eat.<br> I beg you not be angry with me, Mother...<br> ...but do not put food from your mouth<br> into the child's.<br> Well, I fed my own son so.<br> It did him no harm.<br> But it is not thought good now. I bought<br> a book and it told how to care for children.<br> - And it spoke against such things.<br> - Why, you better take your child back.<br> - Doubtless, I pollute him when I hold him.<br> - Mother, it was for you I brought him home.<br> Cool your anger, both of you.<br> Should we quarrel this night, of all nights...<br> ...and over the child<br> who is the center of our hearts?<br> Did I ever have a book<br> to feed my children?<br> Did I ever lose a son?<br> Indulge her with the child.<br> It will heal her for everything.<br> Our house has come alive again, old man.<br> - Good day, friends.<br> - Good day.<br> My son comes from the free land.<br> He has a message from the high command.<br> There are many like me<br> and we spread among the villagers...<br> ...to tell such men as you<br> what we must do.<br> This enemy must be resisted.<br> Openly where the land is free<br> and secretly where the land is lost.<br> We, who must resist secretly,<br> have a harder task than the others.<br> We must work together<br> as the fingers on one hand.<br> We must track down this enemy<br> and kill him.<br> What we should do is this...<br> Join with the hill men?<br> You're inviting us to die.<br> Yes, but to die like men,<br> not sheep on the butchering block.<br> You must not blame our cousin.<br> A scholar can never be as brave<br> as one unlettered.<br> We must build the hole under<br> my father's house into one strong room.<br> And there we will hide the men<br> that must be hidden.<br> - Where did you find these guns?<br> - Some have foreign writing on them.<br> A wise man does not question a gift<br> too closely.<br> I will take the guard now.<br> No, eat first. I am not weary.<br> One of our kinsmen wants to know<br> where you found the guns.<br> Tell him they are easiest found by sticking<br> a knife into the belly of an enemy soldier:<br> And there is the gun for you,<br> as if from his insides.<br> My sons, all my sons.<br> What more can I ask,<br> who am only a woman?<br> To hear our third son speak,<br> one would think he'd like to kill.<br> Oh, how well he looks.<br> And not on my cooking.<br> I do not understand it.<br> Oh, you should see the women<br> admire him now.<br> - And still he has yet to choose one.<br> - Women.<br> Do not turn your nose toward heaven.<br> It's time you brought home<br> a daughter-in-law. See that you do.<br> What would become of us if we did not<br> have the women to keep at us?<br> If you had no women,<br> none of you would be born.<br> I want grandsons before I die.<br> Let fat men like Wu Lien<br> bother with such nonsense.<br> I'm lean enough to fight.<br> That is what I'm going to do.<br> I wanted to ask, what news of Wu Lien?<br> He and his family live in the city<br> and are protected, I heard.<br> Yes, we have heard, but they haven't<br> come to tell us so themselves.<br> Nor has Wu Lien been here<br> to his mother's grave.<br> I have known of others<br> who are protected.<br> Could this mean<br> he deals with the enemy?<br> - I will not believe that until I know it is so.<br> - Nor will I.<br> Someone comes.<br> It is Neighbor Shen, the lookout.<br> Enemy soldiers are in the village.<br> They look for young men<br> to slave for them.<br> Well, then, let us help them<br> find what they seek.<br> - How many of the enemy?<br> - A line from here to the door.<br> Kinsman, come out<br> and bring enough guns...<br> ...for the others who will act with us.<br> This is the beginning of it, then.<br> - You will be safe?<br> - Let them come, the bandy-legs.<br> Get into the cart.<br> These Chinese pigs do not fight.<br> They were born to be slaves.<br> But this one is strong.<br> Yes, a good work animal.<br> - This one will be sent to the mine.<br> - We made a good catch tonight.<br> This is almost too easy.<br> Bring the rest to the cart.<br> They're the ones I found.<br> We need more work animals like this.<br> Search the houses again.<br> Some of them are still hiding.<br> Shoot any that resist.<br> We must teach them<br> that it is an honor to serve the emperor.<br> - Stop him.<br> - Catch him.<br> If he escapes, we are lost.<br> He will bring others to kill us.<br> - Don't shoot. Don't shoot.<br> - Do not be afraid.<br> I am not going to shoot you.<br> Come to bed, old man.<br> Or have you learned to sleep standing up?<br> The name of the book<br> that Jade once read...<br> ...was it not All Men Are Brothers?<br> It was. But is that something<br> to steal your rest?<br> This is what troubles me.<br> How can Jade send forth her husband<br> to kill other men if all men are his brothers?<br> Perhaps because the bandy-legs<br> are no longer men but beasts.<br> But must we, too, become as beasts?<br> Tonight, I learned<br> that men kill differently.<br> I saw our third son with his knife and...<br> He came back into this house...<br> ...and picked up food and ate it<br> with the blood still upon his hands.<br> I say that is wrong.<br> Yet the enemy is upon us.<br> We must kill them or be killed.<br> But there is one thing we must remember,<br> old woman, or we have killed ourselves too.<br> Peace is good.<br> The young cannot remember it.<br> And it is we who must remember...<br> ...and teach them again<br> that peace is man's great food.<br> If you had two sons,<br> there would be no work done.<br> Someone comes.<br> It is only your elder sister.<br> - Do not tell them we are here, Mother.<br> - We will go to the hidden room.<br> This is a strange day when brothers<br> and sisters hide from each other.<br> All days are strange now.<br> Soldiers.<br> They look rich.<br> Were they always so fat?<br> Perhaps our eyes have grown<br> used to people afraid and hungry.<br> My old ones, here we are to see you.<br> A thousand fortunes.<br> I trust you are well.<br> Are we then welcome to come within?<br> You and your family are welcome.<br> But I cannot let others into my house.<br> You need not fear.<br> These two only came to guard me.<br> What guard do you need in my house?<br> My father-in-law is old and afraid.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> But I will not have them in my house.<br> Then I must wait here with the guards.<br> - Will you bring stools to sit upon?<br> - I will.<br> Country people, they have no manners.<br> Where, then, are my brothers?<br> They are gone, and we are alone.<br> Even your elder brother's children<br> are dead.<br> They died of sickness and starvation.<br> It is the times.<br> I grieve for my elder brother<br> and for you also. I weep for you.<br> Do not waste your tears.<br> My own have dried.<br> Why are you so stiff?<br> You must know that what I do<br> is done only for the best.<br> I do not know what you do.<br> Times are times, and the wise man<br> takes his time as he finds it.<br> Compromise is sometimes<br> better than valor.<br> Where do you live now?<br> At the 10th house<br> of the North Gate Street.<br> That is a street of fine houses.<br> How can you live there?<br> I am told to live there.<br> I work for the new government.<br> I'm well-paid and I'm content.<br> You see what I would say,<br> my father-in-law?<br> I am a common man. I am so stupid...<br> ...I understand only a thing when it<br> is said to me, and when I hear it.<br> I come here today to help you.<br> If you do as I say, your life will be easier.<br> - What must I do?<br> - Do whatever is told you to do.<br> And I will manage for you<br> here and there as I'm able.<br> What had you to do, son-in-law?<br> For one thing, I'm a controller<br> of all incoming goods.<br> Rice and wheat, fish, opium, salt...<br> Opium? Opium? That evil was driven from<br> our country by great pain and suffering.<br> - And now you bring it back.<br> - But I'm not my own master.<br> How can you be so hard?<br> After all, there are only<br> you two old people left.<br> - And we are all you have.<br> - We can live.<br> You do well to leave.<br> We are not wanted here.<br> What our son feared was true.<br> Curse this enemy.<br> He has made me quarrel<br> with my daughter.<br> See? Silk coats and enemy soldiers<br> to serve him.<br> It is plain Wu Lien<br> has got his fingers into the fat.<br> Of what value is a rich relative<br> unless you can put him to use?<br> We are his kinsmen<br> and would see Wu Lien.<br> Go in. Wu Lien sees anybody.<br> Where are the rooms of Wu Lien,<br> our rich relative?<br> In there.<br> What greater pleasure is there<br> than a short visit from relatives?<br> But next time, eat the fish.<br> Do not bring it to us.<br> Wu Lien, you're a kind, good man.<br> Can you not find my old man<br> a worthless little piece of work...<br> ...here in these walls<br> to pay us something?<br> But will my father-in-law<br> let him come here?<br> My husband by right should have<br> more power than your father-in-law...<br> ...because he is older.<br> And it is time he took that power.<br> Do you think the same way,<br> elder cousin?<br> - My husband always thinks as I do.<br> - And how's that?<br> I think we must save ourselves<br> at all cost...<br> ...and bow before what is upon us...<br> ...and do what we can<br> to make something of it.<br> Yes, perhaps you will be more content<br> to remain in the village...<br> ...where you are known<br> and know everybody.<br> But you are welcome to visit us here.<br> We'll give you food, money.<br> And then you can give us the news.<br> We have very little to tell.<br> Nothing happens in our village.<br> Much has happened and more will.<br> Wu Lien.<br> My old man and I will be<br> as one eye and one ear.<br> And all that we see and hear,<br> you shall see and hear also.<br> We always like to hear how you do,<br> and my wife's father and mother.<br> - And her brothers also?<br> - Of course, of course.<br> They are also our kin.<br> But since they are away,<br> there must be little news of them.<br> True, true, they're all in the free land<br> and not at home.<br> Then perhaps I saw Jade<br> and her fat child in a dream.<br> Oh, Jade has a child, then?<br> Yes, yes, the news came in a letter<br> from the free land.<br> - But we've not seen the child.<br> - Child is a fine boy. Too fine.<br> Death sits on his eyebrows, I say,<br> whenever I look at him...<br> ...which is often.<br> You live well here, cousin.<br> Your position must be good.<br> It is smooth on the top<br> but under it is another thing.<br> Our conquerors feel a rising anger<br> that may engulf us all.<br> How then?<br> Too many soldiers have gone forth<br> from the city for food and goods...<br> ...and have not returned.<br> Not even their bodies have been found.<br> It is a great mystery,<br> and one that may destroy all of us.<br> Even the innocent.<br> Now, now, I will speak and fully.<br> The enemy is sure to find out<br> that the killing started in our village.<br> Then what will our lives be worth?<br> Wu Lien, we had nothing to do with it.<br> It is Ling Tan.<br> Ling Tan and his sons. They are<br> all returned and work with the hill men.<br> - I've seen them and they are the leaders.<br> - The woman's blind as a mole and crazy.<br> Not too blind to see enemy dead<br> piled in the streets and buried...<br> ...in the hidden room beneath<br> Ling Tan's house where men and guns are.<br> Yes, other young men have died,<br> my son among them.<br> But not the sons of Ling Tan.<br> No, they still spit<br> and stride about and boast.<br> Woman, how can you utter<br> such lies against Ling Tan?<br> He has been good to us.<br> He has fed us often.<br> - Can you forget this?<br> - I can forget it.<br> He likes to give us small gifts.<br> It makes him bigger in his own eyes.<br> - Shall we thank him for his own pride?<br> - I'm not concerned with his pride.<br> - I'd rather have some of my own.<br> - And you shall have. I will see to it.<br> When you wear a silk coat<br> over a full round belly...<br> ...you will have pride in yourself then.<br> What use to speak to you of pride<br> when we use the same word...<br> ...but mean different things by it?<br> Of all men on earth,<br> you are least like a man.<br> - Do not worry about that one.<br> - Yes.<br> He will follow me, or answer to me.<br> We will always be glad to see you,<br> kinswoman.<br> Another time? Another quiet little talk<br> such as this one has been.<br> Yes. Yes, as soon as we have<br> fresh news.<br> My poor father and his household<br> walk on a rope above a pit.<br> I have forgotten<br> the things we have heard.<br> Have you, my husband?<br> No, I have a mind that lets go of nothing.<br> Captain Sato calls for you.<br> - He says, bring the work you have finished.<br> - Oh, yes, yes. Yes, at once.<br> The Chinese people<br> welcome their good neighbor...<br> ...who gives them food,<br> peace and safety.<br> - It is a clever work.<br> - Thank you.<br> And perhaps it will help us<br> to put an end to all these killings.<br> I will put the poster<br> in all the usual places.<br> Chinaman!<br> Come here.<br> Did I not instruct you<br> to obtain information for me...<br> ...about the disappearance of our soldiers?<br> - Sir, I...<br> I have found nothing as yet.<br> Do you think that one village<br> is the center of this rebellion?<br> And if it is, how can we find it?<br> Perhaps we should burn all the villages<br> and shoot all the farmers.<br> Will that end this stupid resistance?<br> Perhaps, sir. Perhaps, but then...<br> ...who would plant and harvest<br> the crop next year if you did that?<br> And if there was no crop,<br> how could your army here be fed?<br> - How would you yourselves eat, great ones?<br> - We thought of that, Chinaman.<br> We only wondered if you had also.<br> - And so we are all agreed.<br> - Yes, great one.<br> We are agreed<br> that we must find that center.<br> - And destroy it.<br> - Yes, great one.<br> - And it will be your privilege to help us.<br> - Thank you.<br> I will have information soon.<br> If it is possible, very soon.<br> Thank you.<br> How could we conquer a country<br> without its traitors?<br> They order me to broaden the smile<br> on the face of the soldier.<br> Do they not know a broader smile will only<br> make him resemble a shark the more?<br> You did not speak<br> of your new knowledge?<br> I did not.<br> Will you ever speak of it?<br> As long as I am able, I will not.<br> But when you are no longer able,<br> what then?<br> How can I tell that?<br> How does a man know today<br> what he must do tomorrow?<br> You are afraid. You are in danger here.<br> Where am I not in danger?<br> In these times, one chooses to live<br> in the den of the tiger or the lion.<br> There is no other place.<br> And I am a man in the middle.<br> How can a man in the middle stay there<br> without splitting himself?<br> And if he does that,<br> he is only half a man.<br> Half. Can half a man still live?<br> Here is our third cousin.<br> How are you, cousin?<br> What is it?<br> I should have killed her<br> even as she spoke.<br> Who would you kill then?<br> The female I call my wife.<br> Has that woman been snapping<br> at your heels again?<br> Had I killed her,<br> I myself would have been killed...<br> ...but at least our village<br> would now be safe...<br> ...and all our kinsmen.<br> What is this, cousin?<br> This is not easy for me to say<br> but I must.<br> My wife is a traitor.<br> She has told Wu Lien all she knows<br> of what happens here.<br> Of the secret room<br> and your sons and the resistance.<br> Wu Lien, the running dog.<br> He must be silenced.<br> But he may not speak.<br> There is another who has already spoken<br> and may do so again...<br> ...the wife of our cousin here.<br> I can say only this.<br> She will speak no more.<br> You have killed her.<br> No, no, I did not kill her.<br> Although there was a moment...<br> ...when I thought she no longer breathed.<br> I beat her.<br> I beat her until she leaned<br> against the wall to keep from falling.<br> What then of Wu Lien?<br> We must remember this:<br> He is of our family.<br> Our sons return<br> from the hills tonight.<br> They will know how to deal with him.<br> There is but one way.<br> I know my husband will see it as I see it<br> and be willing to do what must be done.<br> Would you have him<br> kill his brother-in-law?<br> Rather than have<br> his brother-in-law kill him.<br> I cannot decide this alone.<br> Come, cousin.<br> It concerns us all in the village.<br> Can anything ever be the same again<br> even though peace comes?<br> Some small good has come of this.<br> Out of it, I am born a man again.<br> I must go to the city.<br> I read what you would do in your eyes.<br> - You are with me on this, Mother?<br> - I am with you, Daughter.<br> Women ever must act<br> while men waste time in talk.<br> The great power of this...<br> ...is that a grain kills in a second<br> and is as tasteless as flour.<br> Many women buy this poison<br> in these times.<br> Some for themselves<br> and some for others.<br> How much will you need?<br> I may not need any at all.<br> I hope I do not.<br> But I will take as much<br> as I have money to buy.<br> Wu Lien?<br> Jade. It cannot be.<br> How are you, sister-in-law?<br> This house is well-guarded.<br> But when I told them I was your relative,<br> the gate opened like magic.<br> Yes, they guard themselves,<br> but not against my husband.<br> Why do you stare so at me?<br> Are you not glad to see me?<br> Yes. Yes, I am glad.<br> You look well, if not fat.<br> I have not rested yet. I returned<br> from the free land only yesterday.<br> - Only yesterday?<br> - Where's my silk coat, I...<br> Here is Jade to see us. She tells me<br> she returned but yesterday.<br> Together with my husband and son.<br> And today, they still sleep.<br> Welcome, sister-in-law,<br> we're glad you are home again.<br> The old ones have been too long alone.<br> - Now, where is my coat?<br> - Here it is. Ready for you to wear.<br> My husband will be honored tonight<br> at a banquet for the conquerors.<br> Yes, and now I must dress for it.<br> Will not our women's prattle disturb him?<br> Oh, no, no. I will not hear it.<br> As I came through the city,<br> I found many changes.<br> My husband says<br> the conqueror prides himself...<br> ...on the public improvements<br> he has made.<br> Improvements?<br> Today, I saw enemy soldiers<br> pasting up a picture...<br> ...which showed another enemy soldier<br> smiling and giving food to our people...<br> ...who knelt before him.<br> That is my husband's handiwork.<br> Is it not good to look upon?<br> Very.<br> Beneath the picture and looking up at it<br> stood hungry people.<br> And they brought bowls<br> and crept close...<br> ...and scooped up some of the paste<br> that the soldiers were using.<br> And then they ran away<br> and hid and ate it.<br> Ate the paste?<br> Even that is better than nothing.<br> But the conqueror does give food.<br> He gives it to us<br> and there must be others.<br> Yes, there are others.<br> The enemy sometimes gives sweets,<br> and often to children.<br> Well, then, you must admit<br> that giving sweets to children is not evil.<br> Is it not? In the sweets is opium.<br> When once the children eat it, they have<br> the hunger that is fire in their veins.<br> And so they are spoiled forever.<br> Your own children look well.<br> He has learned the tongue of the enemy<br> very quickly.<br> Who knows what<br> he may grow up to say in it.<br> We will remember<br> our own things to tell him.<br> Then do not forget<br> to tell him of the other children.<br> And the mothers and fathers<br> of those children...<br> ...all tied together and soaked with oil.<br> And burned alive<br> while they cried for mercy.<br> I will hear no more of this.<br> All the killing.<br> Tell your wife not to shudder,<br> brother-in-law.<br> People now take these as things<br> that may happen to any one of us.<br> - And any day.<br> - I will get tea.<br> I trust I did not disturb you.<br> I heard very little.<br> Can it be that you have trained your ears<br> not to hear what you do not wish to hear?<br> You...<br> You must forgive my wife.<br> She is but a woman and not as we are.<br> I do not think we are the same.<br> I think you are against me<br> and all who are with me.<br> I am against no one.<br> Are you for us, then?<br> I'm neither for nor against anything.<br> What you are not for, you are against.<br> You have changed<br> while you were away in the free land.<br> I'm not sure the change becomes you.<br> No. No, it does not.<br> A woman should be soft,<br> like the skin of a peach.<br> Not hard like the stone<br> which does no one any good.<br> Do not forget that the tree itself<br> grows from the stone.<br> Surely that is the beginning<br> of everything.<br> If I could see my parents sometimes,<br> I would be content.<br> Your husband is content<br> and so must you be.<br> Yes, I am what I am. And so is my wife.<br> And she is one who has always known<br> her place as a woman and kept to it.<br> Will you tell my parents this for me?<br> - Will you tell them I think of them often?<br> - Yes, she will tell them.<br> And now, if you wish to feed<br> your children, we will excuse you.<br> Will you not share some tea with me,<br> brother-in-law...<br> ...although I am only a woman?<br> Come, I will pour it for you.<br> No. Although I thank you.<br> I cannot eat when I have<br> something on my mind to do.<br> My stomach growls and takes offense.<br> Surely you are a man who should<br> nourish himself at every opportunity.<br> Do not worry about me.<br> I will eat myself full tonight.<br> There is duck<br> and I am very fond of duck.<br> Oh, enter, enter.<br> Well, then, cook,<br> I trust everything in the kitchen is well.<br> You sent for me. I am here.<br> Do not waste time on idle talk.<br> Yes, I sent for you, but only to ask...<br> ...if the food will be prepared<br> in fashion as I have ordered.<br> Steamed duck,<br> pullets with Chinese herbs...<br> ...pigeon eggs in soup,<br> and shark's fins with crabmeat.<br> All will be ready.<br> You have too many words.<br> - Be sure everything is ready...<br> - It will be ready when it is ready.<br> - I am not a man to be hurried.<br> - Yes.<br> You see, we have plenty of food here.<br> More than enough.<br> - Will you not take some home with you?<br> - No.<br> Oh, but why? It will only be thrown<br> to the dogs. Why do you not take it?<br> Because, brother-in-law,<br> we are not dogs.<br> Wait. You cannot enter.<br> Strangers are not allowed in the kitchen.<br> What is the...?<br> Did you not send for someone?<br> A new cook, perhaps?<br> Well, I would not think<br> cooking is one of your talents.<br> How can you know that<br> until you have tried me?<br> I will throw her into the street.<br> I will do that myself. Later, perhaps.<br> Get on with your work.<br> How did you get into this house?<br> Is it not plain? Wu Lien sent for me.<br> Why?<br> Oh, you need not answer.<br> I have seen his wife.<br> It is time to baste the pigs.<br> Get them ready.<br> Now, tell me,<br> why did you come into the kitchen, huh?<br> I am hungry. There is food here.<br> Why, did you not get food from Wu Lien?<br> Wu Lien will not last.<br> He could not feed me for long.<br> Nor can I.<br> Chinese are not allowed in the kitchen.<br> But I am one who is of no country.<br> I am only a woman.<br> Can you blame me if I would be<br> with those who have conquered here?<br> - So you like us, then?<br> - No, I do not.<br> But I like hunger even less.<br> Oh, so you're not afraid.<br> Can it be that I have found<br> a woman of my own liking?<br> - You will feed me then?<br> - Feed you? Food is dear.<br> How will you pay for it?<br> How? How else then<br> to make myself useful?<br> Useful? Oh, yes, I will make you useful.<br> Noodles, bring the noodles. Hurry.<br> Here, you. You, bring the noodles, quick.<br> I am busy.<br> Stay out of my way until I finish my work.<br> Then we shall eat.<br> Yes, we shall eat together.<br> Alone and in private.<br> Here. Soup noodles,<br> are they ready? Come.<br> Where are the pigeon's eggs?<br> These are the fish.<br> Have you not finished yet?<br> It's almost time to serve them.<br> Fine duck. Gravy. Gravy for the duck.<br> Mushrooms. Where are the mushrooms?<br> - These are not fine enough.<br> - The fish.<br> Noodles. More noodles, hurry.<br> You fool. Do not burn the sauce.<br> The crabmeat. Cut it fine.<br> I have said stay out of my way.<br> So you have eyes only for the food,<br> not for me, huh?<br> Very well, if you are so greedy,<br> take some of the duck.<br> Go on, take it.<br> Eat it.<br> No. No, little one, it would be my head<br> if I were to let you have any of that.<br> Here, now, take these.<br> Serve them while they're hot.<br> I have your own word for it, little one.<br> The hungrier you are,<br> the better it is for me.<br> Duck.<br> Duck, swimming in its own juices.<br> I went to great trouble to get them<br> and have them cooked to your orders, sirs.<br> The wine for the duck, where is it?<br> Wine?<br> Well, it will be served soon,<br> I have ordered it.<br> - Order it again.<br> - Yes, great one.<br> He sweats a great deal,<br> even for a Chinese.<br> He will sweat even more tonight.<br> We will amuse ourselves a little with him<br> before we make him talk for us.<br> Excellency, admiral, major, captain,<br> please.<br> Be patient, little one.<br> Now, they call these shrimp?<br> I asked for fresh shrimp.<br> Here now.<br> You would not be leaving<br> before you have eaten.<br> I was weary of waiting.<br> I would eat elsewhere.<br> - You will not...<br> - Where is the wine?<br> - The wine will come later. I am trying to...<br> - That woman! Stop her. Stop her.<br> Stop her. That woman.<br> Stop that woman.<br> Do not let her get away.<br> Stop. Stop her.<br> - You. You frightened her away.<br> - How long has she been in this kitchen?<br> Why the difference?<br> A woman like that is too good for you.<br> Now neither of us will have her.<br> Was she...?<br> Call the guard. Call the guard.<br> Family.<br> Call the guard.<br> Chinaman!<br> What is it?<br> The enemy...<br> ...was poisoned.<br> They blame me.<br> Go to your father. Take children. Quick.<br> - Quick, quick.<br> - No. No, I cannot.<br> Who did this?<br> Go.<br> Our kinsmen are not agreed<br> among themselves.<br> Some say kill Wu Lien at once.<br> I say kill Wu Lien. Yes, kill him<br> and let me do it.<br> Heaven will lead me to the place and time<br> and heaven will put power in my hand.<br> Do not say heaven this and heaven that.<br> If we kill, let us not say<br> it is heaven who bids it.<br> It is not heaven's will<br> that men kill each other.<br> We know better.<br> You lie dead with your ancestors...<br> ...instead of living.<br> - How could you have borne such a son?<br> - How could you have fathered him?<br> - Wu Lien is of our family.<br> It is our one hope that he cannot<br> bring himself to destroy us.<br> But we must be sure.<br> My mother, my father,<br> it is your daughter.<br> I will go.<br> - Mother. Mother.<br> - What is it?<br> My husband is dead.<br> And so poison was put into the food<br> of the high enemy officials by someone...<br> ...and they blamed my husband for it<br> and killed him.<br> - The enemy killed him?<br> - They shot him.<br> And he came to me holding<br> the last of his life inside him with his hands.<br> He lived only for his family,<br> and now he is dead.<br> - He was so good.<br> - I have been cheated of my pleasure.<br> You were there today, Jade.<br> You saw him. And now he's dead.<br> My husband is gone and I'm a widow.<br> Poison is a woman's weapon.<br> Yes, it is.<br> And it was I who used it.<br> I thought so.<br> I saw the look that passed<br> between you and my mother.<br> You said we must be sure.<br> I was sure.<br> He would have betrayed us.<br> I would not have killed him<br> had I thought he would not.<br> You did not kill him.<br> The enemy did.<br> No.<br> No, I killed him as surely<br> as I'm now here.<br> And he was one of ours.<br> It was right that he should die.<br> And will you hate me?<br> Why would I hate you?<br> I am so thin.<br> My flesh is so hard.<br> My face is dark<br> and not like a woman's face.<br> You do not look as you did<br> when I married you, it is true.<br> Would you have married me then<br> if I had looked as I do now?<br> Doubtless, I would not.<br> But I myself was not the same man<br> that I am now.<br> And what pleased me then<br> would not please me now.<br> - Do I please you now?<br> - You do.<br> As always, this feeling between us...<br> ...we can return to it from anything.<br> And then summer was gone.<br> And the grain had kept its promise.<br> Again, the old ones waited for the return<br> of Jade and her husband...<br> ... who'd been summoned<br> to the meeting place in the hills.<br> Someone comes.<br> It is our children, home from the hills.<br> - Well, then, you are back.<br> - Father, Mother.<br> - You are well.<br> - Well enough.<br> You are in time to help us harvest.<br> If we are clever,<br> we can pass this winter safely.<br> The crop is good this year<br> and the grain lies heavy in the hand.<br> Yes.<br> This field would feed many people.<br> Father, will you call<br> the heads of the village?<br> We have a task for them to do.<br> A meeting? But there is a danger<br> in a meeting while it is still light.<br> Tell them to gather<br> at the first hour of the darkness.<br> There is a thing we must do,<br> and at once.<br> The enemy will never be defeated<br> if we feed him...<br> ...but without our food, he will starve.<br> - I will not destroy food nor my house.<br> - It's too much.<br> - It's against the law of man to do it.<br> - It is the task the high command has set.<br> You must burn all you have<br> and leave only the ashes behind you.<br> Can it be that you, my son,<br> ask this of me and our kinsmen?<br> I ask it that the enemy may be destroyed.<br> Not only do we feed them<br> but we stay here as their work animals.<br> What we hear are the words<br> of a young fool.<br> I, for one, will not listen to any more.<br> I will not burn my house,<br> nor leave what I have.<br> But we... We resist here.<br> We keep what food we can<br> from the enemy...<br> ...and we kill him how and when we can.<br> - It is enough.<br> - It is not enough.<br> - Do you not love your country?<br> - Love my country?<br> You say that to me? Do I not love this earth<br> and is this earth not my country?<br> Though I die, I stay with it.<br> Can a man love his country<br> better than that?<br> But, my father,<br> this earth is only your country...<br> ...in peacetime when there is freedom.<br> I know only this. We must hold the land.<br> You will hold only a handful of dead soil.<br> You will lose<br> your whole country doing it.<br> - I will not listen.<br> - Ling Tan is right as always.<br> Yes, we will not leave our land.<br> We will hold it.<br> Now, what's wrong<br> with all these long faces?<br> We have failed.<br> Our kinsmen and our father among them<br> have refused our plan.<br> - You will not do as you're told to do?<br> - I will not, nor will the other kinsmen.<br> There's an answer. Hold a gun<br> at their heads and make them do it.<br> - It must be their own will.<br> - The old should be allowed no will.<br> The old and the new again.<br> There must be some meeting.<br> There's no meeting<br> what is dead and what is alive.<br> Father and men like him grow too old<br> and have walked too long.<br> Others need the room they take.<br> You may not strike me.<br> I should beat you.<br> Killing and love of killing,<br> that is all you know.<br> Yes, but I know it well.<br> These are other times.<br> And I can kill you as well as any other.<br> Yes, you can kill me.<br> I think you can kill anyone now.<br> But I will kill no more.<br> - Come back here.<br> - I will not.<br> I've eaten enough foolishness<br> in this house, and for the last time.<br> I must go with him.<br> You will find us in the hills,<br> for you will follow us.<br> Happiness in this family is over.<br> Nothing is left to anyone...<br> ...if the old can no longer<br> look to the young for obedience.<br> I have come to this.<br> I will not grieve the day they tell me<br> my third son is dead.<br> He has become the sort of man<br> I hate and fear most.<br> Such men will not allow peace<br> in the world.<br> War springs from them<br> as fire does from tinder...<br> ...and is their pleasure in their life.<br> Such men should die for the good of all.<br> You blame your son for what he is.<br> Who should I blame, then?<br> It was his own arm he raised against me<br> and his own voice.<br> You cannot blame him.<br> Has his life been as it should?<br> Has he had peace to live and find a wife?<br> Have sons of his own?<br> No, he put the will<br> he would have used...<br> ...into another thing: The will to kill.<br> So changed from the boy who wretched<br> at the sight of the first dead...<br> ...that he would strike his own father.<br> Well, are we not all changed?<br> Can we get our old selves back<br> if the devils are not driven out soon?<br> Can you?<br> You...<br> You hate to kill above all else.<br> Yet you have killed...<br> ...as skillfully as you once tilled the land.<br> - I will not hear this.<br> But you shall hear it.<br> And our mother, has she not changed?<br> Now she runs, takes up her hoe<br> and buries the enemy...<br> ...as though the human flesh<br> were animal.<br> Can she get back to the old way?<br> Can she forget what she's done?<br> And your sons, they all kill. Your third son<br> because he has come to love it.<br> Your eldest because it's the easiest thing<br> to do and my...<br> Your second son because he must.<br> But we all kill.<br> We kill and kill again. Can you deny this?<br> No, no, I cannot.<br> I've learned to hold a gun and fire it<br> from the doorway.<br> And then go in and feed my son.<br> And what is the child eat into himself<br> with the food?<br> Look at him. Look at him.<br> Do not turn away.<br> Even now your grandchild sharpens<br> his little teeth on an empty shell...<br> ...and does not hate<br> the taste of gunpowder.<br> He's young still. His mind, at least,<br> is untouched.<br> He can be saved<br> and taught a decent way to live...<br> ...if the enemy is driven<br> from our country.<br> What will become of him<br> if this horror goes on?<br> How can I teach him honesty<br> when he must lie and cheat to live?<br> How can I teach him mercy when<br> he must either kill first or be killed?<br> How can I teach him faith in mankind...<br> ...when he sees nothing but distrust and<br> when even in his own family are traitors.<br> - Am I to blame for these things?<br> - You're not.<br> But you will be to blame,<br> we'll all be to blame...<br> ...unless we defeat the Japanese<br> and drive them from this country...<br> ...and prevent them<br> from ever doing this again.<br> How will you answer your son when<br> he asks you why you left our land?<br> I will tell him...<br> I will tell him it was to save him<br> and his family...<br> ...and his whole country.<br> You had no...<br> I cannot...<br> For a cloud covers my mind.<br> What will you do now, my son?<br> We will join our brothers in the hills<br> where at least we can fight on.<br> We will leave this house during<br> the last hours of the darkness before dawn.<br> Here is food for your journey.<br> We are glad you have come.<br> It would have been a bitter thing<br> if you had not.<br> If you can wait, we will go with you.<br> Go with us?<br> Yes, I will burn my fields and my house<br> and go with you.<br> Do my ears hear what you are saying,<br> old man?<br> They hear what we must do,<br> for the cloud is now gone from my mind.<br> I have spoken to all our kinsmen<br> in the village...<br> ...and told them the things you told me.<br> I gave them the hour<br> that I would fire my house...<br> ...and asked them to do the same thing.<br> - But will they?<br> - I do not know.<br> It is a great deal to ask of them,<br> and against their natures.<br> But what will become of me<br> and my children?<br> You will go and take your children<br> to where my sons are in the hills.<br> - The son of Neighbor Shen can guide her.<br> - Yes. We will meet you there.<br> And you will take our son too.<br> These things will mark our land...<br> ...so when we come back<br> we can prove it is ours and claim it.<br> What nonsense is this?<br> In a while, these things will be ashes,<br> so, what matter how they look now?<br> Would you bury a friend<br> without first arranging him decently?<br> In these rooms, your father<br> and his father before him died.<br> And our children were born here<br> and should die here.<br> I helped you dig once, now you help me.<br> - A worry has struck me.<br> - What now, woman?<br> What if the stranger who walks<br> on the other side of your land...<br> ...finds these things and steals them?<br> - He will not steal from us.<br> - How can you know that?<br> I see clearly now, and for the first time.<br> Third cousin once said that there<br> is one sun and one moon for all.<br> If that is true,<br> all share the sun and moon...<br> ...why should we not also<br> all share the earth?<br> This valley is not the world<br> but only part of the world.<br> And there are others like me<br> whose faces I have never seen.<br> Elsewhere,<br> there are men who love peace...<br> ...and long for good and who will fight<br> to get these things.<br> So the stranger is no longer<br> a stranger to me but a man like me.<br> If I could but know him.<br> If I could but see him.<br> What good to see him<br> if you could not speak?<br> You would not need speech.<br> If what you wish is the same,<br> there would be understanding between you.<br> Yes, that is true.<br> Somehow tonight, I feel that there<br> is a power sweeping around the world...<br> ...bringing us all together<br> with that stranger.<br> - And I, too, feel it, my father.<br> - So do I.<br> - Why am I left out of this?<br> - It is time now, my father.<br> - Shall I fire the house?<br> - No.<br> Your mother and I will do this.<br> We will fire the east field first, then.<br> Leave the north fields for the last,<br> so that we may escape that way.<br> Look back once, old woman.<br> Then look back no more.<br> Keep to the hill road.<br> My father, look.<br> Can it be even one of our kinsmen<br> is with us?<br> It is only a lantern.<br> No. No, it is a fire.<br> - And there's another.<br> - And another.<br> - Can it be? The whole village?<br> - It is, old woman. We are not alone.<br> - I'm weary, my lord.<br> - But you are not bruised as yet.<br> Why can you not come with us?<br> No, my mother.<br> My place is here with my brothers.<br> The enemy fears to come here.<br> My sister will be safe and have food.<br> I think it best. Our road ahead will be hard,<br> old woman. And our daughter...<br> My father, I have seen what you have done,<br> and the others also.<br> I am ashamed.<br> No more than I, my son.<br> Well, then, I would have you<br> take your place of command...<br> ...as head of our family once more.<br> I think there is now another command,<br> even above that.<br> We have each been told what we must do,<br> and we will do it.<br> - You that our young will stay here and fight.<br> - And you, Father?<br> I would be where these hands<br> can be used.<br> I and my old woman<br> will go into free China...<br> ...and raise food to fill your bellies<br> while you fight.<br> Let us go, then,<br> while the strength is still in us.<br> There is a thing.<br> If one of us lives, he must go back one day<br> to claim the land.<br> I so charge you all.<br> If you live, you must do this.<br> My wife and I will walk<br> a little way with you.<br> We would see you out of sight.<br> At this moment we part,<br> we are closer than ever before.<br> When will this one begin to read?<br> As soon as he can be taught.<br> He will learn quickly,<br> for he is the hope of us all.<br> His eyes are open.<br> Make sure that the one who teaches him<br> has his eyes open also.<br> We will do that. We do it now.<br> Take your grandchild with you.<br> Yes, my father, take him with you.<br> Care for him and teach him.<br> He will be as our own.<br> What else? For that is what he is.<br> So it came about that while Ling Tan<br> left the land behind him...<br> ... he did not leave hope.<br> For he carried it with him in Jade's child.<br> That child so truly,<br> the seed of the dragon.<br>
