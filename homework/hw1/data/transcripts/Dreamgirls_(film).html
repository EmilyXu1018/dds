She did it."<br> But it's ridiculous. Come on.<br> She's 16 years old<br> for most of the movie.<br> Well, baby, you'll always be 16 to me.<br> Maybe that's the problem.<br> Maybe you just don't see me<br> for who I am.<br> When I first saw you<br> I said, "Oh, my"<br> I said, "Oh, my, that's a dream<br> "That's my dream"<br> I needed a dream<br> When it all seemed to go bad<br> Then I found you<br> And I have had the most<br> beautiful dreams<br> Any man's ever had<br> When I first saw you<br> I said, "Oh, my<br> "Oh, my, that's my dream<br> "That's my dream"<br> I needed a dream to make me strong<br> You were the only reason I had to go on<br> You are my dream<br> All the things I never knew<br> You are my dream<br> Who could believe<br> they could ever come true?<br> And who would believe<br> the world would believe<br> in my dreams, too?<br> When I first saw you<br> I said, "Oh, my<br> "Oh, my<br> "That's my dream"<br> - What would make you happy, Deena?<br> - You know.<br> We got plenty of time for that.<br> Please, Curtis.

Long time.<br> Yeah, Curtis.<br> And you're still a second-class snake.<br> First-class to you.<br> Gentlemen, give me a break.<br> Why, Curtis? Did you give Effie one?<br> - I could kill you for what you did to her.<br> - You couldn't kill shit.<br> I assume you guys have a reason<br> for barging in here<br> other than to insult me.<br> Mr Taylor, we're planning to go<br> to the federal authorities.<br> Yeah, we'll tell the feds how<br> you killed Effie's record. Payola, man.<br> You remember, Curtis, I witnessed it all.<br> The whole dirty operation going back<br> to Steppin' to the Bad Side.<br> That's right you did,<br> but who's going to believe you?<br> All you are is a guy that's pissed off<br> 'cause you got fired.<br> We have documented evidence,<br> Mr Taylor.<br> Falsified sales records<br> to cheat investors out of their profits,<br> goods-quality merchandise listed<br> as cutouts to disguise the fraud,<br> mob-backed loans,<br> and a payola operation<br> stretching back 11 years.<br> Who gave you this?<br> Believe me, I had no idea<br> what Curtis was trying to do to you.<br> Effie, are you all right?<br> I'm happy now, Deena.<br> I have a child who loves me.<br> - You have a baby?<br> - Magic's not exactly a baby anymore.<br> She's almost nine now.<br> I wanted to tell you.<br> At the time, I really wanted to tell you.<br> Deena, he doesn't know.<br> Effie, Effie, Effie.<br> Well, I see you're just as much trouble<br> as you ever were.<br> Hello, Curtis.<br> You haven't changed much, either.<br> Actually, I take that back.<br> You are looking a little heavy, baby.<br> You could lose some weight.<br> I'll deal with you later.<br> Mr Taylor agrees it's in everyone's<br> interest to resolve the situation<br> without resorting<br> to draconian legal measures.<br> Say that in English.<br> Nationwide distribution of our<br> version of One Night Only, Effie.<br> - On our own label.<br> - That sounds good to me.<br> And remember, Curtis,<br> if these negotiations fall apart<br> you're going straight to jail.<br> That's right, Curtis.<br> You stopped me once,<br> but you'll never stop me again.<br> 'Cause this time<br> Effie White's gonna<br> win<br> Deena! Get your ass out here!<br> Hello, Curtis.<br> Hey, May. What are you doing here?<br> I mean, I thought you said you hate LA.<br> Oh, I do. But my daughter said<br> she needed me, so I'm here.<br> Go wait in the car, Mama.<br> That was a dirty trick you pulled on me.<br> I had to do something<br> to stop you, Curtis.<br> - How could you do that to Effie?<br> - I had to do what I had to.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> Out looking for a new sound, baby,<br> just like you.<br> - You can't leave.<br> - Why?
