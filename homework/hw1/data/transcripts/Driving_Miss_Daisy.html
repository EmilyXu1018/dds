                        I'm gone to the market, Idella.<br> Pepsodent's new improved formula<br> cleans teeth whiter than ever.<br> Are you all right, Miss Daisy?<br> That's good!<br> You two get back to work.<br> - Mama!<br> - No!<br> It's a miracle you're not laying at<br> Emory Hospital or the funeral parlor.<br> Cucumbers are pretty this summer.<br> You didn't even break your glasses.<br> It was the car's fault!<br> - You had the car in the wrong gear.<br> - I did not!<br> Idella, want a pickle with lunch?<br> Not me.<br> I'm putting up a jar for<br> you to take home to William.<br> You backed the car into<br> the Pollack's yard.<br> You should have let me keep my Lasalle.<br> It wouldn't have behaved this way.<br> Mama, cars don't behave.<br> They are behaved upon.<br> You demolished that<br> Chrysler by yourself.<br> Think what you want.<br> I know the truth.<br> The truth is you just cost<br> the insurance company $2,700.<br> You are a terrible risk.<br> Nobody will issue you a policy now.<br> You're just saying that to be hateful.<br> Okay. Yes, I am!<br> I am making it all up.<br> Look out on the driveway!<br> Every insurance company in<br> America is out there...<br> ...waving their pens<br> to get you to sign up.<br> If you're going to stand in my pantry<br> and lie like a rug, go somewhere else.<br> I better get back to the office.<br> Florine will have a fit if I don't<br> get home on time tonight.<br> You all must have plans tonight.<br> The Ansleys' dinner party.<br> This is her idea of heaven on earth.<br> What?<br> Socializing with Episcopalians.<br> You are a doodle, Mama!<br> I'll stop by tomorrow evening.<br> How do you know I'll be here?<br> I'm not dependent on you for company.<br> Fine, I'll call first.<br> But you know, we have got some<br> real serious talking to do.<br> No!<br> I need you now. I have to be at<br> the beauty shop in half an hour.<br> No, I most certainly did not know you<br> had to call a minimum of 2 hours ahead.<br> Why call yourself a taxicab company<br> if you can't provide taxicabs?<br> Why don't you call your son?<br> He'd send someone to carry you.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> I'll cancel the appointment<br> and fix my own hair.<br> Sometimes I think you ain't<br> got the sense God gave a lemon.<br> Two dots. I want that!<br> And a five bamboo.<br> Well, this is not my day for mah-jongg.<br> Nine bam!<br> Thank you all for coming here again.<br> I am a real pariah without my car.<br> Oh, nonsense!<br> When do you get the new one?<br> I don't know! Boolie's<br> being real pokey about it.<br> I'll come after you for temple tomorrow.<br> That's sweet of you, honey.<br> Mama, you there?<br> It's just us!<br> Why didn't you call?<br> We can't stay.<br> So I gather.<br> The Millers are giving a hay ride.<br> I had these made.<br> Doesn't your baby look cute?<br> Well, it's not exactly<br> the word I'd pick.<br> New Graham Greene?<br> I been wanting to read that.<br> Sorry, but it's due back<br> at the library tomorrow.<br> - Want me to return it for you?<br> - No, thank you.<br> I'll go to the library on the streetcar.<br> Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.<br> You know perfectly well...<br> Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.<br> Bye!<br> Is that door making contact?<br> Oscar?<br> I'm here.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - No, sir, I'm stuck.<br> I know. Fiddle with the lever.<br> It fiddled out. I done all I know how.<br> Call Bell Elevator.<br> I already did. They're<br> backed up until around 1:00.<br> Did you tell them it's an emergency!<br> You don't have to holler, Mr. Werthan.<br> I did not break the elevator.<br> Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?<br> Wrapped and ready to go!<br> I promised it for today.<br> Call Bell again.<br> I hear you.<br> Look up where the gate is supposed<br> to close. See a do-hickey?<br> Wait a minute.<br> Right here!<br> Reach up and mash it<br> up until it catches.<br> I done it. Now what?<br> Operate the lever.<br> Do you work here?<br> No, sir. This here Hoke.<br> Hoke Colburn, sir.<br> How'd you know about the elevator?<br> I used to drive for a dairy, sir.<br> Their elevator was<br> worse than this one.<br> Hoke the one I told you about.<br> Of course.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Y'all people's Jewish, ain't you?<br> Yeah, we are. Why?<br> I'd rather work for Jews.<br> I know folks say they stingy and cheap.<br> But don't say none of that around me!<br> Good to know you feel that way.<br> What was your last job?<br> I worked for Judge Harold<br> Stone, a Jewish gentleman.<br> You worked for Judge Stone?<br> Seven years. I'd still be<br> there if he didn't up and die.<br> Mrs. Stone asked me to move<br> to Savannah with her.<br> Of course, my wife was dead by then.<br> But I said, "No, thank you, ma'am."<br> I didn't want to be too<br> far from my grandbabies.<br> Judge Stone was my father's friend.<br> You don't say?<br> Sit.<br> Later, Miss McClatchey.<br> Oscar said you needed somebody<br> to drive for your family.<br> Will I be taking your<br> children to school...<br> ...and your wife to the beauty parlor?<br> I don't have any children.<br> What I need...<br> You're still a young man.<br> Don't worry too much.<br> Thank you. I won't.<br> Hoke, I need somebody<br> to drive my mother around.<br> Yes. Well, if you don't<br> mind my asking, sir...<br> ...why ain't she hiring for herself?<br> It's a difficult situation.<br> She done gone around the bend a little.<br> That will happen as they get on.<br> No, she's all there!<br> Too much there is the problem!<br> I want you to understand something.<br> My mother is a little high strung.<br> The fact is, you would<br> be working for me.<br> She can say anything she likes...<br> ...but she can't fire you. Understand?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Yes, sir, I sure do.<br> Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.<br> I'll hold on no matter<br> which way she run me.<br> I was a little boy back on the farm<br> above Macon where I come from.<br> I wrestled hogs to the<br> ground during killing time.<br> Well, sir, there ain't a<br> hog got away from me yet!<br> How are you, Idella?<br> Living.<br> - Where's the new vacuum cleaner?<br> - In the closet.<br> She won't touch it.<br> It gives me a shock<br> every time I'm near it.<br> It works for me.<br> Good! Then you clean and I'll<br> go down and run your office.<br> Where's Mama?<br> Up yonder.<br> I guess you know who this is.<br> I'll be right back.<br> I wouldn't be in your shoes...<br> ...if the sweet Lord Jesus came<br> down and asked me Himself.<br> Good morning, Mama.<br> Just come down and say hello.<br> You listen here.<br> Unless they rewrote the Constitution<br> and didn't tell me, I still have rights!<br> Of course.<br> What I do not want, and absolutely<br> will not have, is...<br> ...some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,<br> gobbling my food, using my phone.<br> I hate that in my house.<br> You have Idella.<br> Idella's different!<br> She's been coming to me for years.<br> We stay out of each other's way.<br> Even so, there are chips<br> in my wedding china.<br> You think Idella has a vendetta<br> against your wedding china?<br> Don't be sassy.<br> When we couldn't afford them,<br> we did for ourselves.<br> That's still the best way.<br> "Them?" "Afford them?"<br> You sound like Governor Talmadge.<br> What a thing to say!<br> I'm not prejudiced!<br> Aren't you ashamed?!<br> You might as well make the best of it.<br> I knew a Miss Idella once.<br> Back down in Macon.<br> You don't say?<br> She sang!<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm talking about this<br> woman had some lungs!<br> She'd be a whole church<br> choir by herself!<br> I declare!<br> Fat, too!<br> She was as big as that stove!<br> Don't talk to Idella!<br> She has work to do.<br> What are you doing?<br> Dusting the bulbs, Miss Daisy.<br> That's the silliest thing I ever saw.<br> Who cares if lamp bulbs are dusty?<br> Get down from there!<br> Put that ladder away<br> before somebody trips.<br> I'm gone, Miss Daisy.<br> All right, Idella. See you tomorrow.<br> - I'm going too, Miss Daisy.<br> - Good.<br> Good morning, Miss Daisy.<br> Thought I'd see after your zinnias.<br> Leave me flower bed alone.<br> You got a nice piece of ground behind<br> the garage that ain't doing nothing.<br> I could put in tomatoes...<br> If I want a vegetable garden,<br> I'll plant it myself.<br> What are you doing?<br> I just love a house with<br> pictures, Miss Daisy.<br> It do make a home.<br> I don't want you nosing<br> through my things.<br> Good morning, Miss Daisy.<br> It was right cold in the night.<br> I wouldn't know. I was asleep.<br> Idella says we're<br> running short on coffee...<br> ...and Dutch cleanser.<br> We are?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> We're low on silver polish, too.<br> I know.<br> I'm fixing to go to the<br> Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.<br> On the trolley!<br> Why don't you let me carry you?<br> No, thank you.<br> Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?<br> That's his problem.<br> All right. But I'm going to<br> find something to do here.<br> You leave my things alone!<br> I'm gone to the market, Idella.<br> Miss Daisy, it's a shame.<br> You have this fine Hudson<br> automobile out there in the garage.<br> It hasn't moved an inch from<br> when Mr. Werthan drove it here.<br> That insurance company gave you<br> a brand new car for nothing.<br> That's your opinion.<br> My other opinion is that a fine rich,<br> Jewish lady like yourself...<br> ...has no business dragging herself<br> onto a trolley carrying grocery bags.<br> I'll carry them for you.<br> I don't need you!<br> I don't want you!<br> And don't say I'm rich!<br> - I won't say it no more.<br> - Is that what you and Idella talk about?<br> I hate being discussed behind<br> my back in my own house!<br> I was born on Forsyth Street.<br> Believe me. I know<br> the value of a penny!<br> My brother brought<br> home a white cat once.<br> We couldn't keep it because<br> we couldn't afford to feed it!<br> My sister saved up money...<br> ...so I could become a teacher!<br> We had nothing!<br> But you're doing all right now!<br> What are you doing?!<br> I'm trying to drive you to the store!<br> Where are you off to this<br> morning, Miss Werthan?<br> Just a little shopping.<br> Go away! I've ridden the trolley<br> with the groceries plenty of times!<br> But I can't keep taking<br> Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.<br> How much he pay you?<br> Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.<br> Anything over $7 a week<br> is highway robbery!<br> You sure are right about that!<br> Especially since I don't do nothing...<br> ...but sit on a stool all day.<br> All right!<br> Piggly Wiggly.<br> Then home. Nowhere else.<br> Oh, I just love the smell of a new car.<br> Don't you, Miss Daisy?<br> I am nobody's fool, Hoke.<br> I know!<br> My husband taught me to run a car.<br> I remember everything he said.<br> So don't think even for a second you...<br> Wait. You're speeding.<br> I can see it!<br> We only going 19 miles an hour.<br> I like to go under the speed limit.<br> But the speed limit is 35 here.<br> The slower you go the more gas you save.<br> My husband taught me that!<br> Ain't hardly moving.<br> Might as well walk...<br> ...to Piggly Wiggly.<br> Is this your car?<br> No.<br> Do you pay for the gas?<br> - No.<br> - All right, then!<br> My son thinks I'm losing my abilities...<br> ...but I am still in control<br> of what goes on in my car!<br> Where are you going?<br> To the store, like you said.<br> Why didn't you turn on Highland?<br> Piggly Wiggly ain't on Highland.<br> I know where it is!<br> Now take Highland Avenue.<br> - That's 3 blocks out of the way.<br> - Go back this minute!<br> - I can't turn now.<br> - I've been driving to Piggly Wiggly...<br> ...since it opened for business.<br> This isn't the way!<br> Go back this minute!<br> Miss Daisy, look. Yonder<br> is the Piggly Wiggly. See?<br> Get ready to turn.<br> Careful. There's a little girl.<br> Yes, I see her.<br> Pull in here.<br> Wait.<br> Give me the keys.<br> Stay right here by the car.<br> And don't tell everyone my business.<br> Mr. Werthan?<br> Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.<br> I just drove your mama to the store!<br> You know, she flapped around some,<br> but she's all right. She's in the store.<br> Oh, Lord, she just looked<br> out the window and seen me.<br> She'll probably throw a fit right<br> there at the check-out counter.<br> Yes, sir. You are right about that.<br> It only took me 6 days.<br> Same time it took the<br> Lord to make the world.<br> Yes, sir. All right. 'Bye.<br> Hey Oscar, Junior. How you<br> old boys doing today?<br> How the lady been treating you?<br> I'll tell you one thing;<br> she knows how to throw a fit.<br> What's so funny?<br> Nothing, Miss Daisy.<br> We just carrying on.<br> Oscar and Junior been doing cleaning<br> here for 15 years. Never carried on before!<br> Leave them alone.<br> Put your coat on.<br> We're late.<br> Idella, I'm gone now.<br> I'm right behind her.<br> Hear, oh Israel, the Lord<br> our God, the Lord is one.<br> Such a nice man. And such a good,<br> short sermon, wasn't it?<br> I can get it myself!<br> Hurry out of here!<br> Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?<br> Something I done?<br> Yes.<br> I haven't done anything.<br> You parked the car right in front of the<br> temple, like I was the Queen of Romania.<br> Everybody saw you!<br> I said to wait for me in back.<br> Yes, Ma'am, but I was just trying to...<br> There were two chauffeurs<br> right behind me.<br> You made me look like a fool.<br> A g.d. fool!<br> Oh, Miss Daisy, Lord<br> knows you ain't no fool!<br> Slow down!<br> Miriam and Beulah, I could see what<br> they were thinking when we came out.<br> What's that?<br> That I was pretending to be rich!<br> - You is rich.<br> - No, I'm not!<br> Nobody can say I put on airs.<br> On Forsyth Street we made many<br> meals of grits and gravy.<br> I have done without plenty of times.<br> Miss Daisy, if I was to ever<br> get my hands on what you got...<br> ...shoot, I'd shake it around<br> for everyone in the world to see.<br> That's vulgar! Don't talk to me!<br> Never understand some white folks.<br> What was that?! I heard that!<br> Now, Miss Daisy...<br> you needs a chauffeur...<br> ...and Lord knows I need a job.<br> So why don't we just leave it at that?<br> Good morning, Mama.<br> What's the matter?<br> No, I don't always think<br> something's wrong when you call.<br> Just when you call so early.<br> What?!<br> All right. I'll be there<br> as soon as I can.<br> I better get on over there.<br> 'Bye.<br> Come on.<br> It's not healthy to rush like this.<br> I eat too much, anyway.<br> Besides, it sounds like she needs me.<br> When doesn't it?<br> Give Mother Werthan my love.<br> Coffee, Katie Bell!<br> I didn't expect to<br> find you in one piece.<br> I wanted you to be here<br> when he comes.<br> I wanted you to hear it<br> for yourself.<br> What is going on?<br> He's stealing from me.<br> Hoke? Are you sure?<br> I don't make empty accusations.<br> I have proof!<br> This! I found it hidden in the<br> garbage under some coffee grounds.<br> - He stole a can of salmon?<br> - Here it is!<br> I knew there was something funny.<br> They all take things, you know.<br> So I counted.<br> The silverware first.<br> Then the linen napkins.<br> And then I went into the pantry.<br> And the first thing that<br> caught my eye was a hole...<br> ...behind the lima beans.<br> And I knew right away.<br> There are only 8 cans of salmon.<br> I had 9!<br> Very clever, Mama.<br> I missed my breakfast and<br> I'm late to a meeting...<br> ...for a 33c can of salmon?<br> You want 33c? Here's $1!<br> Here's $10! Buy yourself<br> a pantry full of salmon!<br> Why, Boolie, the idea!<br> Waving money at me like that!<br> I don't want money.<br> I want my things!<br> - One can of salmon?<br> - Well, it was mine!<br> I leave him plenty of food every day.<br> I tell him exactly what it is.<br> Like children. If they want<br> something, they just take it!<br> He'll never admit this.<br> "No," he'll say, "I don't<br> know nothing about that!"<br> I don't like it! I don't<br> like living with no privacy.<br> Go ahead, defend him.<br> You always do!<br> I give up! You want to drive again,<br> arrange your own insurance.<br> Take the trolley.<br> Buy yourself a taxicab!<br> Anything you want!<br> Just leave me out of it!<br> Why, Boolie!<br> What's he doing here<br> this time of morning?<br> Can't be good, I promise you that!<br> I think it's fixing to<br> clear up out there!<br> Excuse me, Mr. Werthan.<br> Y'all busy?<br> We have to have a little talk, Hoke.<br> All right, just let me<br> get out of my coat.<br> Yesterday, while you were out,<br> I ate a can of your salmon.<br> Now I know you said to eat<br> the leftover pork chops.<br> Well, they were kind of stiff.<br> So, I stopped by the Piggly<br> Wiggly and got you another can.<br> Do you want me to put it on the shelf?<br> Yes, thank you, Hoke.<br> Be right with you, Mr. Werthan.<br> Well, I got to get dressed now.<br> Good-bye, son.<br> You know, Miss Daisy,<br> I was just thinking.<br> We been out to this cemetery<br> It ain't even the 20th yet.<br> It's good to come in nice weather.<br> Yes, ma'am. You sure<br> right about that. Sure is.<br> Mr. Sig's grave is mighty well tended.<br> I think you're the best widow<br> in the State of Georgia.<br> Boolie's always pestering me to have<br> the staff here tend to this plot.<br> "Perpetual care," they call it.<br> Well, don't you do it!<br> It's right to have member of<br> the family looking after you.<br> I'll never have that! Boolie will have<br> me in perpetual care before I'm cold.<br> Miss Daisy, you ought to<br> go on away from here!<br> Put that azalea on Leo Bauer's grave.<br> Leo Bauer. Is that Miss<br> Rose Bauer's husband?<br> She asked me to bring it out here.<br> Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?<br> I'm not exactly sure. I know<br> it's two rows over that way.<br> You'll see the headstone, "Bauer."<br> What's wrong?<br> Nothing wrong.<br> Nothing the matter at all.<br> Now, you say...<br> I told you it's two rows over that way.<br> It says "Bauer" on the headstone.<br> What that look like?<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm talking about I can't read, ma'am.<br> What?!<br> I can't read, Miss Daisy.<br> You look at the paper all the time.<br> Well, that's just it. I just be looking!<br> I try to dope out what's going on...<br> ...from the pictures.<br> You know your letters?<br> Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.<br> I just can't read.<br> Stop saying that!<br> You're making me mad!<br> If you know letters, then you can read.<br> You just don't know you can read.<br> I taught some of the stupidest<br> children God ever put on this earth.<br> And they all could read enough<br> to find a name on a tombstone.<br> The name is "Bauer."<br> "Bauer!" What does that "buh"<br> letter sound like?<br> - B?<br> - Of course!<br> "Er." That is the last part. "Bauer!"<br> What letter sounds like "er"?<br> R!<br> - So the first letter is...<br> - B!<br> And the last letter?<br> R!<br> B-R. Brr.<br> It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?<br> It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!<br> - That it?<br> - That's it.<br> - What about the middle?<br> - Not right now.<br> This will be enough for you to find it.<br> B at the beginning.<br> R at the end.<br> B... R.<br> That's it.<br> That's all right!<br> I sure do appreciate this!<br> Don't be ridiculous!<br> Let's get all this back in the car.<br> I'm burning up.<br> Of course I told you!<br> Of course I told you!<br> How can I be expected to buy it<br> if you don't write it down?!<br> I'm sorry, Miss Florine.<br> I need you.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Do you have any idea what it takes<br> to give a Christmas reception?<br> It takes an eye for detail.<br> I told you a million times,<br> Katie Bell, write it down!<br> More I cannot do!<br> We are out of coconut.<br> I'm sure we can manage.<br> - I told her.<br> - You didn't write it down!<br> I don't need to stand and<br> listen to excuses on Christmas.<br> You figure out how to serve ambrosia to<br> Don't worry, Katie Bell.<br> It's not quite the end of the world.<br> Everybody's giving the Georgia<br> Power Company a merry Christmas.<br> Bet Miss Florine beat them all,<br> especially with the new house.<br> Absurd!<br> If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn't<br> say, "Merry Christmas" to anybody.<br> I enjoy Christmas at their house.<br> No wonder. You're the<br> only Christian in the place.<br> They got that new cook.<br> Florine never could keep help.<br> Of course, it's none of my affair.<br> Too much running around.<br> The Garden Club this...<br> ...the Junior League that.<br> As if they'd give her the time of day.<br> She'd die before she'd fix a glass of<br> iced tea for the Temple Sisterhood.<br> I hope she doesn't take it into<br> her head to sing this year.<br> Lord have mercy!<br> Look what Miss Florine done.<br> If her grandfather, old man<br> Frietag, could see this.<br> What is it you say?<br> I bet he'd jump out of his<br> grave and snatch her baldheaded.<br> Jump up and snatch her baldheaded.<br> Oh, Miss Daisy, you<br> go on away from here.<br> Wait a minute.<br> This isn't a Christmas present.<br> You know I don't give<br> Christmas presents.<br> I happened to run<br> across it this morning.<br> Well, go on, open it.<br> Look at that.<br> Ain't nobody never gave<br> me no book before.<br> "Zaner Method Writing."<br> I always taught out of these.<br> I saved a few.<br> It's faded, but it works.<br> If you practice, you'll write nicely.<br> But you have to practice.<br> I taught Mayor Hartsfield<br> out of the same book.<br> I sure do thank you.<br> It's not a Christmas present.<br> Jews have no business<br> giving Christmas presents.<br> You don't have to go yapping<br> about this to Boolie or Florine.<br> This is between you and me.<br> Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.<br> I hope I don't spit up.<br> Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.<br> She fought me on this one.<br> But it is time for a trade.<br> I'll bet you'll miss the old one.<br> No, sir, I don't expect<br> I'll miss it that much.<br> Come on, you're the only one<br> who's driven it all this time.<br> Won't you be a little<br> sorry to see it go?<br> It ain't going nowhere.<br> I done bought it.<br> You didn't.<br> I sure did. Already made the<br> deal with Mr. Red Mitchell.<br> How much?<br> That is for him and me to know.<br> Hey, Boolie!<br> Got a gem here.<br> Got that paper, Hoke?<br> I got it right here.<br> Be right there.<br> Why didn't you buy it from Mama?<br> Would have saved money.<br> No, sir. Your mama is in my<br> business enough as it is.<br> I ain't studying about making<br> monthly payments to her.<br> She is mine the regular way.<br> The Hudson's a good car.<br> Nobody knows that better than you.<br> Best that ever come off the line.<br> And this here new one, if Miss<br> Daisy don't take to it...<br> ...l'll let her ride in this one.<br> Mighty nice of you.<br> We do what we can.<br> It is three after seven.<br> Yes, Ma'am. You said we were<br> leaving at fifteen to eight.<br> At the latest, I said.<br> What business you got dragging this<br> mess out of the house by yourself?<br> Who was here to help me?<br> Lord have mercy!<br> It don't take more than 5<br> minutes to load this car.<br> You're fixing to break your arms and<br> your legs before we even leave the manor.<br> You're taking on too much.<br> I hate doing things at the last minute.<br> What you talking about?<br> Been ready to go for a week and a half.<br> - Give me that package.<br> - No, don't touch that.<br> It sure is pretty.<br> Is that Mr. Walter's present?<br> Yes. It's fragile.<br> I'll put it on the seat.<br> You nearly missed us.<br> You were leaving at quarter of.<br> - She's taking on.<br> - Be still!<br> Florine bought this for Uncle Walter.<br> Mama, it's not a snake!<br> I think it's notepaper.<br> How appropriate.<br> Uncle Walter can't see.<br> Maybe it's soap.<br> How nice that you take an interest<br> in your uncle's 90th birthday.<br> Don't start up with me, mama...<br> ...I can't go<br> to Mobile with you.<br> I have to go to New York<br> for a convention.<br> The convention starts Monday.<br> And I know what else I know.<br> Leave Florine out of this.<br> She ordered those tickets 8 months ago.<br> I'm sure "My Fair Lady" is more<br> important than your relatives.<br> Those Christians will be impressed.<br> I can't talk to you<br> when you're like this.<br> - We're expected in Mobile for supper.<br> - You'll be there.<br> - How will you stand her all day?<br> - They'll fix crab. All that trouble.<br> She's just worked up.<br> Here's $50 in case you have trouble.<br> Don't show it to Mama!<br> - Have you got a map?<br> - She's got it in the back seat.<br> It's 7:16!<br> You should have a job on the<br> radio announcing the time.<br> - I want to miss rush hour.<br> - You will.<br> Congratulate Uncle Walter for me<br> and kiss everybody in Mobile.<br> The air conditioning...<br> ...did you check it, like I said?<br> I got the air conditioning checked.<br> I don't know why.<br> You never let me turn it on!<br> Hush up!<br> Good luck!<br> Good God!<br> Turn left.<br> No, right! Turn right!<br> Did I ever tell you about the<br> first time I left Georgia?<br> When was that?<br> A few minutes back!<br> Go on!<br> My daughter...<br> ...is married to a Pullman porter.<br> She is always on the go.<br> New York, Detroit, St. Lois.<br> I say, "That's all well<br> and good, Tommie Lee...<br> ...but I don't feel the need for it."<br> So here it is.<br> The first time.<br> And I might tell you, Miss Daisy...<br> ...Alabama is not<br> looking like much so far!<br> Idella sure does stuff eggs good!<br> You stuff yourself good.<br> I was thinking about the<br> first time I went to Mobile.<br> It was Walter's wedding: 1888.<br> but a little bitty thing.<br> I was 12.<br> We went on the train.<br> Oh, I was so excited.<br> I'd never been in a wedding party.<br> I had never seen the ocean.<br> Papa said it was the Gulf of Mexico, not<br> the ocean, but it was all the same to me.<br> I asked Papa if it was all right<br> for me to dip my hand in the water.<br> And he laughed because I was so timid.<br> And then I tasted the<br> salt water on my fingers.<br> Isn't that a silly thing to remember?<br> No sillier than most of<br> what folks remember.<br> Boy!<br> What are you doing with this car?<br> This is my car, officer.<br> Can I see your registration,<br> please, and your license, boy.<br> What's this name? Wertheran?<br> Werthan.<br> Never heard that one.<br> What is it?<br> It is of German derivation.<br> German derivation.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> An old nigger and an old Jew woman<br> riding down the road together.<br> Now that is one sorry sight.<br> Oh, my God!<br> The sign says Phenix City 30 miles.<br> We're not supposed to go to<br> Phenix City! Oh, my God!<br> Maybe you read it wrong.<br> I didn't. Stop the car. Stop the car!<br> Lord have mercy.<br> Here. You took the<br> wrong turn at Opelika.<br> You took it with me, Miss Daisy.<br> And you got the map.<br> I was getting the lunch!<br> Go on back. My God!<br> It aint' more than 30<br> minutes since we turned.<br> They fixed crab for me.<br> Minnie always fixes crab.<br> They go to so much trouble.<br> It's all ruined by now.<br> We going to have to pull over.<br> What's wrong with the car?<br> There ain't nothing wrong with the car.<br> I got to be excused.<br> I got to go make water.<br> You should have thought of<br> that at the service station.<br> You know colored can't use the toilet<br> at any service station, Miss Daisy.<br> There's no time to stop.<br> We'll be in Mobile soon. You can wait.<br> No, ma'am.<br> - I told you to wait!<br> - I heard what you said.<br> How do you think I feel having to<br> ask you can I go make water...<br> ...like I am some child.<br> I'd be ashamed.<br> I ain't no child, Miss Daisy.<br> And I ain't just a back of the neck you<br> look at while you go where you got to go.<br> I am a man. I'm near 70 years old.<br> And I know when my bladder's full.<br> Now I'm going to get out of this car...<br> ...and go over there<br> and do what I got to do.<br> And I'm taking the key with me, too.<br> Now that's all there is to it!<br> Hoke!<br> Hoke!<br> Hoke?<br> You all right, Miss Daisy?<br> Of course I am.<br> Is that you, Slick? It's Boolie.<br> How you doing?<br> Congratulations on your dad's big day.<br> Thank you, Boolie. Thank you.<br> Aunt Daisy!<br> It's Boolie on the phone.<br> Hey, son!<br> Uncle Walter appreciates your call.<br> I don't think he can come to the phone.<br> Fine. How's Hoke?<br> What do you mean?<br> How should he be?<br> Happy birthday, Uncle Walter.<br> I got to hang up now, Boolie.<br> Yeah, I'll tell him.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow.<br> Which nobody can deny!<br> Morning, Miss McClatchey.<br> Well, good morning to you.<br> Can I see him?<br> It's Mr. Sinclair Harris, sir.<br> My cousin Sinclair?<br> His wife... The one that talk funny.<br> She's from Canton, Ohio.<br> She's trying to hire me.<br> - What?!<br> - Yes, sir. She said:<br> "How they treating you<br> down there, Hoke?"<br> You know how she sound,<br> like her nose stuffed up.<br> So I said, "Fine, Mrs. Harris,<br> just fine, thank you."<br> She said, "Well, you looking for<br> a change, you know who to call."<br> I'll be damned!<br> I thought you ought to know about it.<br> I'll be goddamned.<br> Ain't she a mess?<br> Said, "Name your own salary."<br> I see. And did you?<br> Did I what?<br> - Name your own salary?<br> - Go away. What you think I am?<br> I ain't studying working for<br> no trashy something like her.<br> But she got you thinking, didn't she?<br> Well, sir, you might say that.<br> Name your salary.<br> That's exactly what she said.<br> Well, how does $65 a week sound?<br> Sounds pretty good, sir.<br> Course, $75 sounds better.<br> It sure does!<br> Beginning this week.<br> That's mighty nice of you.<br> I sure appreciate this. Thank you.<br> You ever have folks fighting over you?<br> No.<br> It sure feels good.<br> One dot.<br> Nine dot.<br> Two dot.<br> Mah jongg.<br> You are the luckiest thing, Beulah!<br> Excuse me.<br> I don't know how you can look at that.<br> See it a few times, you get in it.<br> Both your brains are<br> fixing to evaporate.<br> You can bring the cake now, Hoke.<br> Don't make a mess with those peas.<br> Do I ever?<br> Lord have mercy, look at that.<br> Ain't she got a lot of hair?<br> How she get it so shiny?<br> Washes it in mayonnaise.<br> - Go on away from here, Idella!<br> - Yes, she did.<br> I read it in Life magazine.<br> Don't seem human, does it?<br> He will tear you to shreds!<br> I am not going into that court.<br> And I'm not giving in!<br> You are at the end of your rope.<br> You murdered Carlson.<br> You have to pay!<br> Either choose the easy way out,<br> or you go into the courtroom...<br> ...and let them carve you<br> into pathetic little bits.<br> You have a minute to make up your mind.<br> What happened? She up to<br> something, ain't she?<br> - You fixing to ruin it.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> You got the chicken too close<br> together and the fire is too high.<br> Mind your business.<br> It's your chicken.<br> Thank you, Hoke.<br> Now you enjoy it.<br> Amen.<br> Who is it?<br> Morning, Miss Daisy.<br> What in the world...?<br> I learned how to drive on ice when<br> I delivered milk for the dairy.<br> Ain't nothing to it.<br> Other folks are banging into each<br> other like they're in the funny papers.<br> I figured your stove was out, so<br> I stopped by the Krispy Kreme.<br> I know you got to have<br> coffee in the morning.<br> How sweet of you, Hoke.<br> We ain't had any good coffee<br> around here since Idella passed.<br> I can fix her biscuits.<br> We both can make her fried chicken.<br> But nobody can make Idella's coffee.<br> Ain't that the truth?<br> Idella was lucky.<br> I expect she was.<br> Where are you going?<br> I'm just going to take these things off.<br> I don't know what you can do here<br> today, except keep me company.<br> Then I'll see if I can make us a fire.<br> Eat anything you want<br> out of the ice box.<br> It will all spoil, anyway.<br> And wipe up what you<br> tracked onto my floor.<br> What do you think I am, a mess?<br> Mama, I'll be right out...<br> ...when I can get down my own driveway.<br> Stay home, Boolie.<br> Hoke is here with me.<br> How'd he manage that?<br> He's very handy. I'm fine.<br> I don't need a thing in the world.<br> Hello? I have the wrong number.<br> Mama's saying loving things about Hoke.<br> I didn't say I love him.<br> I said he was handy.<br> Honestly! Are you trying to irritate<br> me in the middle of an ice storm?<br> Thank you, Wellborn.<br> Thank you all.<br> I am deeply grateful to be<br> chosen 1966 Man of the Year...<br> ...by the Atlanta Business Council.<br> An honor I've seen bestowed<br> on mighty fine fellows.<br> And one I never expected<br> would come to me.<br> I'm afraid that my loss up here...<br> ...and my gain down here...<br> ...have given me an air of<br> competence that I don't possess.<br> I will tell you that I wish my father<br> and grandfather could see this.<br> About 72 years ago, they leased<br> an old mill up on Decatur Road...<br> ...with I believe 25 looms in operation.<br> They managed to grow with Atlanta.<br> And Werthan Industries believes that<br> what we want is what Atlanta wants.<br> And this award proves<br> that we were right.<br> I thank you.<br> Well?<br> What is it? What took you so long?<br> I couldn't help it.<br> There's a big mess up yonder.<br> What's the matter? I might as<br> well not go to temple at all!<br> No, ma'am, you ain't going to get to<br> the temple this morning, Miss Daisy.<br> Why not? What's the matter with you?<br> Somebody has bombed the temple.<br> What? Bombed the temple?<br> That's how come<br> we stuck here so long.<br> I don't believe it!<br> That's what the policeman just said.<br> Oh, my God. Was anybody there?<br> Were people hurt?<br> I don't know. He didn't say.<br> Who would do such a thing?<br> You know good as me, Miss Daisy.<br> It always be the same ones.<br> I remember one time back<br> down there in Macon.<br> Lord, I couldn't've been more than<br> I had this friend named Porter.<br> One day there his daddy<br> was hanging from a tree.<br> Now just the day before, we'd<br> all been pitching horseshoes.<br> Laughing and carrying on and<br> talking about how me and Porter...<br> ...was going to have strong<br> right arms, just like him.<br> Lord, there he was.<br> Hanging up yonder in the tree.<br> Had his hand tied behind him.<br> Flies was all over him.<br> I tell you, I threw up<br> where I was standing.<br> You go on and cry.<br> I'm not crying.<br> Why did you tell me that story?<br> Lord, I don't know, Miss Daisy.<br> That mess back there<br> put me in mind of it.<br> Ridiculous! The temple<br> has nothing to do with it!<br> Yes, ma'am, if you say so.<br> We don't know. Maybe that<br> policeman wasn't telling the truth.<br> Why would he go and lie<br> about a thing like that?<br> You never get things right!<br> Miss Daisy, somebody done bombed<br> that temple and you know it!<br> I don't want to hear anymore about it!<br> - You the boss.<br> - Don't talk to me!<br> - Where are you?<br> - Up here!<br> Hello, Mama. How are you feeling?<br> Not a good question to<br> ask somebody nearly 90!<br> Well, you look fine.<br> It's my ageless appeal!<br> Miss McClatchey gave me your message.<br> Florine is invited, too.<br> Thank you.<br> I guess Hoke should drive us.<br> There'll be a crowd.<br> Mama, we have to talk about this.<br> About what?<br> About the feasibility of all this.<br> I believe Martin Luther King has<br> done some mighty fine things.<br> If you don't want to go,<br> why don't you just say so?<br> I want to go! You know<br> how I feel about him.<br> Of course, but Florine...<br> Florine has nothing to do with it.<br> I still have to do business here.<br> I see. Werthan Bag will go out of<br> business if you attend the King dinner.<br> Not exactly. But a lot of men I do<br> business with would not like it!<br> They might...<br> ...snicker a little.<br> Call me Martin Luther<br> Werthan behind my back.<br> Maybe I wouldn't hear<br> about meetings at the Club.<br> Old Jack Raphael at Ideal Mills, he's a<br> New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew.<br> All the really smart ones come<br> from New York, don't they?<br> Some might throw their business to Jack<br> instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe it wouldn't happen.<br> And sometimes that's<br> the way things work.<br> Anyway, if we don't use those<br> seats, somebody else will.<br> If we do not use those seats?<br> I'm not supposed to go, either?<br> You can do whatever you want.<br> Thanks for your permission.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> When did you get so fired up about<br> Martin Luther King?<br> Why, Boolie!<br> I've never been prejudiced<br> in my life and you know it.<br> Then ask Hoke to go with you.<br> Don't be ridiculous. He wouldn't go.<br> Ask him and see.<br> All right!<br> Boolie said the silliest<br> thing the other day.<br> What did he say?<br> He was talking about Martin Luther Ling.<br> I guess you know him, don't you?<br> King? No, ma'am.<br> I don't know him.<br> I was sure you did.<br> But you've heard him preach?<br> Yes, Ma'am, same way you have.<br> On the TV.<br> I think he's wonderful.<br> - What you getting at?<br> - It's so silly.<br> Boolie says you wanted to go with me<br> to this dinner. Did you tell him that?<br> No, I didn't.<br> I didn't think so. What'd be the point?<br> You can hear him whenever you want.<br> I think it's wonderful the<br> way things are changing.<br> Now what you think<br> I am, Miss Daisy?<br> What do you mean?<br> The invitation to this dinner...<br> ...came in the mail a month ago.<br> Now, if did be you wanted<br> me to go with you...<br> ...how come you wait 'till we in the<br> car on the way before you asked me?<br> What? All I said was Boolie<br> said you wanted to go.<br> Next time you want me to go<br> somewhere ask me regular.<br> You don't have to carry on so much.<br> Let's just leave it alone.<br> Honestly!<br> Talk about things changing.<br> They ain't changed all that much.<br> I'll help you.<br> Thank you, Hoke, I can help myself.<br> ...can see that the South<br> has marvelous possibilities.<br> Yet in spite of these assets...<br> ...segregation has placed the South...<br> ...socially, educationally, and<br> economically behind the rest of the nation.<br> Yet there are in the white South<br> millions of people of good will...<br> ...whose voices are yet unheard...<br> ...whose course is yet unclear...<br> ...and whose courageous<br> acts are yet unseen.<br> These millions are called upon...<br> ...to gird their courage,<br> to speak out...<br> ...to offer leadership that is needed.<br> History will have to record...<br> ...that the greatest tragedy of<br> this period of social transition...<br> ...was not the vitriolic words and the<br> violent actions of the bad people...<br> ...but the appalling silence and<br> indifference of the good people.<br> And our generation<br> will have to repent...<br> ...not only for the words and acts<br> of the children of darkness...<br> ...but also for the fears and<br> apathy of the children of light.<br> Morning, Miss Daisy.<br> Miss Daisy?<br> Hoke, is that Hoke?<br> It's me. You all right?<br> Hoke, what did I do with my papers?<br> My papers! I had them all<br> corrected last night...<br> ...and I put them where I wouldn't<br> forget them on my way to school.<br> What did you do with them?<br> What are you talking about?<br> The children will be disappointed if<br> I don't give them their homework.<br> I always give it back the next day.<br> That's why they like me.<br> You talking out your head.<br> Why aren't you helping me?<br> What'll I do?<br> Find those papers. I told you.<br> It's all right if you moved them.<br> I won't be mad.<br> But I've got to get to school.<br> I'll be late.<br> Who will take care of my class?<br> They'll be all alone.
