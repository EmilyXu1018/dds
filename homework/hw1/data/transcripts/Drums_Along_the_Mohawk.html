Lana, throw it!<br> - Good-bye.<br> - God bless you, Gilbert.<br> - Good-bye, sir.<br> - Good-bye, son.<br> Good-bye, Mrs. -<br> Mother.<br> - Take good care of her.<br> Wait till she sees this.<br> Good-bye. Good-bye.<br> - That sure was a nice weddin'.<br> - Wasn't it?<br> - The cow hitched easy?<br> - Cow?<br> - Giddyap.<br> - Mother, good-bye.<br> Bye.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Oh, no, my friends.<br> It's always been like this<br> since Bible days.<br> Every generation must make<br> its own way in one place or another.<br> - It's the most beautiful country I've ever seen.<br> - I told you so.<br> The Mohawk Valley is the prettiest place<br> in the whole country, for a fact.<br> Susie.<br> Gin.<br> Have one. Just especial,<br> seeing it's tonight.<br> - You folks come far?<br> - Yes. Albany.<br> - Where?<br> - Albany!<br> - Albany.<br> - Yes.<br> Been married long?<br> Oh, not so long.<br> How long?<br> Not so long!<br> I- I thought<br> that's what you said.<br> I knew it the minute<br> I laid eyes on ya.<br> Honeymooners.<br> You got it written<br> all over both of you.<br> Honeymooners!<br> To your health, madam, sir.<br> You planning on settling here<br> in the valley?<br> Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.<br> Deerfield? That's pretty<br> far out of the way, isn't it?<br> Yes, but it suits me.<br> What political party do you folks<br> up that way belong to?<br> The American.<br> Any Tories?<br> Not that I know of. Why?<br> Oh, nothing.<br> I was just wondering.<br> They say the Indians are going to line up<br> with the British, but I suppose that's just talk.<br> Well, good night.<br> That's a queer one, ain't he?<br> Too many questions to suit me.<br> And that patch over his eye-<br> I bet he lost it trying to see something<br> that wasn't none of his business.<br> Good night.<br> Good night now.<br> Good night.<br> You didn't get scared, did you,<br> at what that fella just said...<br> about the Tories and the Indians?<br> I wasn't even thinking<br> about Indians.<br> What were you thinking about?<br> I was just wondering...<br> if you love me<br> as much as I love you.<br> Are there always flies like this?<br> In the real woods there are.<br> It must be gonna rain, though,<br> the way these take hold.<br> You'll get used to 'em<br> up here, though.<br> Lana, we're home now! Look!<br> I'll get a fire going.<br> It's just a cabin, but-<br> Well, I've always thought<br> it would be nice living in a cabin.<br> It's so handy to look<br> after things when it's small.<br> It seemed so fine to me<br> because I built it.<br> I didn't realize it might<br> look different to a girl...<br> who'd been raised<br> in a big house like yours.<br> Oh, it's all right, Gil.<br> Beginning this way...<br> we'll like our things<br> even better when we get them.<br> Oh, Lana.<br> Just wait till I put up the mare and we get<br> something to eat and feel warmer. We'll-<br> Things will look different then.<br> You'd better take those wet things off, Lana.<br> You'll be sick.<br> No! Gil! Gil!<br> Gil! Gil!<br> Oh, Gil! Gil!<br> Gil! Gil!<br> - Get him! Do something!<br> - Why, Lana, that's only Blue Back.<br> - He'll murder us! He'll murder us!<br> - Lana, stop that!<br> Gil-<br> I'm sorry, Lana.<br> I had to do it.<br> You've gotta get<br> a hold of yourself.<br> This is my wife, Blue Back.<br> She's kind of nervous<br> and tired out.<br> We had a long, hard trip<br> in the rain and everything.<br> Sure. Much rain.<br> I guess she didn't expect anybody<br> to drop in at a time like this.<br> Me go hunting.<br> Bring you half deer. Hang outside.<br> Half deer, huh? Well, that's mighty fine<br> of you, Blue Back. Thanks.<br> Sit down. I got some rum outside.<br> We'll have a drink together.<br> No. Me go now.<br> Come back again, maybe.<br> Sure, any time.<br> - You're a good friend, Blue Back.<br> - Sure, fine friends.<br> Good Christian!<br> Hallelujah!<br> Lana.<br> - I'm going home.<br> - Home?<br> I can't stand it!<br> Mother was right.<br> I'm no frontier woman.<br> I had no idea it was like this.<br> I hate it!<br> - Lana, what are you saying?<br> - You had no right to bring me here!<br> It- It's awful! And that horrible man-<br> that Indian slipping in here.<br> Now you're acting crazy again.<br> Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.<br> - Why, he's as good a Christian<br> as you or me, maybe better.<br> - I don't care!<br> - I'm going home. I'm going now! Gil!<br> - No, you're not.<br> You're gonna stay right here<br> and do as I say from now on.<br> You're gonna get over this foolishness<br> and stop being scared. Do you understand?<br> Lana, I didn't wanna hit you.<br> I had to do it.<br> Lana, look at me.<br> I love you.<br> I need you.<br> I can't live without you now.<br> You know that.<br> Yes.<br> Look, here's Blue Back again, see?<br> You got a fine woman.<br> But you young man.<br> You use this on her.<br> Lick her good!<br> Make fine woman.<br> What are you<br> thinking about now?<br> Gil.<br> What are you thinking about?<br> Oh, I was just thinking about what this place<br> is gonna look like couple years from now.<br> Next summer we can start building a barn,<br> right on that slope over there.<br> A hillside barn,<br> just like I've always wanted.<br> Then after that, we can start thinking<br> about building a decent house.<br> I like our house<br> just as it is now.<br> Oh, sure. But I always remember<br> how you ladies hanker after frame houses.<br> Well, I suppose the place will look so beautiful<br> you won't care what your wife looks like.<br> I can get blisters all over my hands,<br> and my nose peeled...<br> and that's the thanks<br> I get for it.<br> Let's see some of those blisters<br> you're talking so big about.<br> No! No, never mind! Leave me alone.<br> Let it go.<br> Why, Lana, your hand is sore.<br> - Maybe you oughtn't come out here like this.<br> - I want to.<br> I know, but haying's hard work.<br> It's about the hardest work there is.<br> It's... no job for a woman.<br> Oh, now, there you go.<br> Just because a woman is raised<br> in a town, she has to be frail.<br> I'm not. I'm strong. You said yourself<br> you couldn't have done without me.<br> - I sure married myself some good hired help.<br> - No, no! Now stop.<br> Stop it yourself.<br> Do you like me as much<br> as you do your old farm?<br> - Good morning, ladies.<br> - Hello, Gil.<br> - Hello.<br> - Good morning, Gil.<br> - Hello, Gil! Good morning, Lana!<br> - Good morning.<br> Joe.<br> Mighty pretty.<br> - Oh, General Herkimer.<br> - Hello, Martin.<br> This is my wife, Lana.<br> Ja. Ja. Hbsch.<br> She's as pretty<br> as the near side of a peach.<br> Maybe prettier.<br> - Reall.<br> - And, Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver and her husband.<br> I'm your nearest neighbor.<br> I've been meaning to call...<br> me and George<br> and John here, my boy.<br> - How do?<br> - I'm so glad to meet you.<br> And this is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall,<br> and her daughter Martha Ellen.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Howdy. And this is my oldest girl, Mary.<br> - Hello, Mary.<br> - Hello, Mrs. Martin.<br> - And Mrs. Demooth.<br> - My husband is the captain.<br> How do you do?<br> - Oh, how do you do?<br> - And Dr. Petry.<br> How do, Mrs. Martin?<br> Oh, pass the lot of 'em.<br> Um-<br> Fall in! Outside.<br> All right, men.<br> Hup! Hup!<br> Hup! Hup! Hup!<br> Hup! Hup!<br> Hup! Hup!<br> Don't be afraid of these women, Mrs. Martin.<br> You'll find they're good neighbors...<br> once they get over being mad at you<br> for being so pretty.<br> - Oh, don't be so silly.<br> - That bonnet you got on<br> is giving them a lot of worry.<br> And they're dying<br> to shoo us men off...<br> so they can find out if you and Gil<br> have got a family on the way.<br> - Oh, Nicholas Herkimer!<br> - We weren't gonna tell anybody.<br> - Lana!<br> Oh, that's just fine.<br> - Congratulations, Martin.<br> - Thank you.<br> That's just fine. A baby.<br> You know, I don't believe<br> in young folks waiting.<br> - I always say a man needs help on his place...<br> - Stick out your tongue.<br> And the only way to get it<br> is to have children, especially boys.<br> - Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.<br> Militia, fall in!<br> - Fall in what?<br> Attention.<br> Dress to the right.<br> - That's my husband.<br> Call the roll.<br> - Amos Brock.<br> - Here.<br> - John Weaver?<br> - Here!<br> - George Weaver.<br> - Here.<br> - Gilbert Martin.<br> - Here.<br> Christian Reall.<br> Christian Reall!<br> Christian-<br> That's me. Here.<br> - Adam Hartman.<br> - Here.<br> - James McNod.<br> James McNod!<br> He couldn't come today.<br> He had to go and buy flour.<br> Then I've got to fine him.<br> That's the law.<br> It don't look to me as though you had any right<br> to fine a man for not coming if he can't!<br> I thought that's what<br> this war was about-<br> making people pay taxes when<br> they didn't have no say-so about it.<br> That's right. That's what<br> I'm carrying Long Tom for.<br> Ain't up to me.<br> Talk to the general.<br> Oh, I guess we can<br> let that go this time.<br> And that's enough of the roll call too.<br> You can check up later.<br> Stand at ease, men.<br> Neighbors...<br> ever since New York and the 12 colonies<br> signed the Declaration of Independence...<br> this revolution<br> has turned into a real war.<br> So far we've been lucky<br> up here in the Mohawk...<br> but it looks like we are going to be<br> dragged into it too.<br> Sure as shootin'.<br> That's why I got you here-<br> to get ready, no matter what happens.<br> I guess we all feel<br> the same way about it.<br> This is our home and our land.<br> And I say it's worth<br> fighting for...<br> only we got to do it<br> by ourselves.<br> Congress can't help us.<br> They say Washington needs<br> all the troops he can get...<br> and that the frontier<br> will have to look out for itself.<br> Maybe them regular soldiers don't like the kind<br> of liquor we drink up here, huh, General?<br> Adam!<br> Maybe not,<br> but that's what they say.<br> Now, about the Indians,<br> from all I hear...<br> the Tories are making them<br> a lot of big promises.<br> We got our agents working too,<br> but there's no telling which way they'll jump.<br> Oh, I don't think we'll have<br> any trouble with the Indians.<br> - We've always treated them fair.<br> - That's right.<br> Maybe so, but just the same...<br> if you hear the bell ringing<br> at the fort or the cannon go off...<br> you drop everything<br> and come running.<br> Do you understand?<br> All of you, come running.<br> Else I have you flogged so fast<br> you won't know what.<br> Now, come on. Show the women<br> how good you can drill.<br> - Take them around the field, Captain.<br> - Attention!<br> Nice talk, Nicholas.<br> Carry arms!<br> Forward left, march!<br> All right!<br> By thunder, I'll bet we can lick<br> the whole world the way we march.<br> Ezra, help us over here!<br> Coming right along with you, Gil.<br> Put it right on top.<br> Look out now.<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Now she's going good.<br> - How is the core- pretty rotten, Adam?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Try to fall it right down in there.<br> - All right.<br> Keep working on the edge. That's the idea.<br> This'll make a nice patch for wheat, Gil.<br> You got good soil here.<br> I figure the loam's<br> close to four feet.<br> Yes, sir, I bet there isn't any better soil<br> in the whole valley.<br> You're just a natural-born farmer,<br> ain't ya?<br> So you'd be,<br> if you'd marry and settle down.<br> There she goes!<br> There she goes.<br> That's gonna be good firewood.<br> There it goes.<br> Start heaving, Cleave.<br> - Push her in, Gil.<br> - Push her in there.<br> Yeah, get on out!<br> - Make it straightaway.<br> - Heave!<br> Heave! Heave!<br> Come on! Come on.<br> You certainly brought a lot of pretty things<br> with you, Mrs. Martin.<br> - Heavenly.<br> - I told Mother there was no sense in bringing...<br> a lot of clothes and such things.<br> I'd rather have the money<br> spent on furniture.<br> - I see you've got one of these feathers.<br> - Yes.<br> Mother had five of them at home.<br> She said there are times<br> in a woman's life...<br> when something like that<br> is more important than bread.<br> - What in the world is it?<br> - A pheasant's feather.<br> Looks like it came out<br> of an angel's wing.<br> We had a lot of them at home, but they collected<br> so much dust, we threw them out.<br> Yes.<br> This is a nice teapot.<br> What is it, Wedgwood?<br> I don't know.<br> It's just white china, I guess.<br> - It belonged to my grandmother.<br> - We always ate off Wedgwood at home.<br> - Eat?<br> - Come on out! They've started burning already.<br> - Great burning. Started it myself.<br> - Come on.<br> Let's go see the burning.<br> Come on.<br> Throw it on there.<br> Gil, it's going to be beautiful.<br> It's Blue Back!<br> Indians on the warpath.<br> Coming.<br> Eight white men...<br> Painted. Better hurry.<br> - Johnny Weaver, get your horse<br> and tell General Herkimer.<br> Stop it! Stop it!<br> - Gil!<br> - Take this, Gil.<br> - Thanks, Joe. Adam, watch out for Lana, will you?<br> - Come on, Lana.<br> - No.<br> - You go too. Senecas, they kill.<br> I can't leave my place,<br> the crops.<br> Gil, you've got to. You've got to come.<br> I won't leave without you.<br> All right, I'll get the cart.<br> Indians. I know. Get.<br> Two, three, four-<br> Two, three- One-<br> Four, five, six-<br> Come on, Christian.<br> They're all here. Get in your wagon.<br> - Here!<br> - Thanks.<br> Gil, the cow,<br> aren't we going to take her?<br> We can't take her.<br> She'll just slow us up.<br> Oh, Gil, I can't stand it.<br> It's like leaving part of ourselves.<br> Don't look back. Giddyap!<br> - Come on, Mary.<br> - Hurry up, Gil!<br> Come on, Gil!<br> - Mr. Martin!<br> - Whoa!<br> Come on, Mary!<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - Where's the rest of your family?<br> - I don't know.

Sit down. Sit down.<br> Now you're here on business,<br> so let's get down to it. You know how to farm?<br> - I had my own place.<br> - Yes, I heard it was burned.<br> Well, that's too bad,<br> but that's neither here nor there.<br> Daisy!

I suppose<br> you want to see your new home.<br> I'll expect you to use the back door<br> if you want to ask me for anything.<br> I don't want mud<br> tracked through my house.<br> I track enough myself.<br> A mess now.<br> After that man.<br> - But it's a good house.<br> - It sure is, ma'am.<br> Nice chimney, nice bedroom upstairs.<br> I used to live here myself...<br> till Barnabas took it into his head<br> to build that stone place.<br> It's a beautiful house.<br> Glad you got sense enough to see it.<br> Now there's one more thing<br> I want to ask you. Got any furniture?<br> We have a bed and a few things.<br> Well, I'll help you out<br> with the rest.<br> You can consider<br> the job yours, Martin.<br> Now, any questions you want to ask?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> It's- I just-<br> - Well, what?

Where women and children<br> shall be gathered together, it says.<br> Me and other men over 60<br> are to collect and protect 'em.<br> You old rooster.<br> Don't you think I can look after myself?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> But it's orders.<br> I been saving a corner shed for you.<br> Shed!

Daisy, some water.<br> Like a stick breaking...<br> and all of sudden, the fella<br> next to me stopped talking...<br> and fell over on his side.<br> Then I heard a whistle.<br> Shots from everywhere.<br> Somebody shouted<br> we'd been ambushed.<br> - I saw General Herkimer slide off his horse...<br> - Oh.<br> And grab his knee.<br> Peter Ten Eyck with<br> his head blown half-off.<br> Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.<br> - Somebody told me to lay down...<br> And then I saw 'em...<br> all smeared with paint-<br> yellow and red-<br> every color.<br> Oh, darling, I'm sorry.<br> In back of 'em,<br> Tories with green coats.<br> I got down back of a log<br> and aimed at a fella.<br> He leaped straight up<br> in the air.<br> - Darling, don't talk about it.<br> - He fell forward on his face.<br> - After that we...<br> Just kept shootin' as fast<br> as we could load...<br> for I don't know how long.<br> Amos-<br> Adam Hartman came over beside me.<br> His musket was broke.<br> But he had a spear.<br> He kept grinnin'.<br> I remember thinkin'...<br> "He's havin' a good time.<br> He likes this."<br> Pretty soon he pointed off.<br> - I saw an Indian comin' towards us, naked.<br> - Darling, don't talk.<br> I tried to load,<br> but it was too late.<br> Adam stood up<br> and braced his spear...<br> and the Indian came down.<br> I never saw a fella<br> look so funny, so surprised.<br> He just... hung there...<br> with his mouth open...<br> lookin' at us<br> and not sayin' a word.<br> - I had to shoot him.<br> There wasn't anything else to do.<br> - Oh.<br> - I had to!<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - Brandy, Nicholas?<br> - Ja, ja.<br> Swallow. Swallow.<br> - Now, Nicholas?<br> Go ahead.<br> Then it started to rain...<br> and I was sick.<br> All the time General Herkimer just sat there<br> smoking his pipe and holding his knee.<br> Then he said we'd all<br> better go home.<br> Oh, darling, don't talk about it.<br> Out of 600 of us...<br> about 240 were still alive...<br> but we'd won.<br> - We licked 'em.<br> - Yes, darling.<br> - We showed 'em they couldn't take this valley.<br> - Yes, darling.<br> - Lana?<br> - Yes, dear.<br> Do you hear?
