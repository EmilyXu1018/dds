                        Deep among the lonely<br> sun-baked hills of Texas...<br> the great and weather-beaten<br> stone still stands.<br> The Comanches called it<br> Squaw's Head Rock.<br> Time cannot change<br> its impassive face...<br> nor dim the legend<br> of the wild young lovers...<br> who found heaven and hell<br> in the shadows of the rock.<br> For when the sun is low...<br> and the cold wind blows<br> across the desert...<br> there are those<br> of Indian blood...<br> who still speak<br> of Pearl Chavez...<br> the half-breed girl<br> from down along the border...<br> and of the laughing outlaw...<br> with whom she here kept<br> a final rendezvous...<br> never to be seen again.<br> And this is<br> what the legend says...<br> A flower known nowhere else...<br> grows from out<br> of the desperate crags...<br> where Pearl vanished...<br> Pearl, who was herself<br> a wild flower...<br> sprung from the hard clay,<br> quick to blossom...<br> and early to die.<br> Pearl.<br> Where's your ma?<br> She's in there, dancing.<br> Like mother, like daughter.<br> I'm commencing to think<br> I like the daughter better.<br> Let go!<br> You go away from me,<br> or I'll call my pa.<br> That renegade creole squaw-man?<br> That's a rich one.<br> I'll just raise you<br> fifty, Mr. Chavez.<br> Would you mind?<br> Mind what?<br> That weed.<br> I find it rather repulsive.<br> Pretty fancy gentleman,<br> ain't you, Mr. Chavez?<br> He's not so fancy<br> about his wife, if you ask me.<br> Look at her.<br> Quitting? Broke again?<br> Yes, gentlemen...<br> but there are<br> greater tragedies...<br> that I'm sure<br> you wouldn't understand.<br> Pa!<br> Pa, will you take me<br> in the Presidio?<br> I ain't never<br> been in there and...<br> And you never should be.<br> What are you doing out here<br> at this hour anyway?<br> I was just dancing.<br> I've told your mother<br> repeatedly...<br> this street is no place<br> for a girl your age.<br> I didn't mean no harm.<br> It's my fault, child, not yours.<br> The sins of the fathers.<br> Go home now, dear.<br> I'll be back in a little while.<br> Don't! Stop!<br> No, Chavez! Don't!<br> Don't! Don't! I beg you! Don't!<br> Pa!<br> I plead no mitigating<br> circumstances.<br> They deserved to die,<br> as I deserve to die.<br> For I long since<br> killed a person...<br> much superior<br> to either of them... myself.<br> I killed that person the day<br> I gave my family's name...<br> to the woman<br> who became my wife.<br> And since I believe...<br> the punishment<br> should fit the crime...<br> I suggest that you hang me<br> by the neck until I am dead.<br> It's from Laura Belle.<br> Did I ever tell you about her?<br> She's my second cousin.<br> Yes, Laura Belle<br> is my second cousin...<br> but she was<br> more than that to me.<br> You see, once upon a time,<br> in a different age...<br> in a different age<br> and such a different world...<br> I was in love.<br> And wonderful to believe,<br> the lady was in love with me.<br> You mustn't look at me<br> as though that were impossible.<br> I was quite the looker<br> in my day and very dashing.<br> Perhaps a bit too dashing.<br> And that's why<br> this very wonderful girl...<br> who might have been your mother,<br> decided on security...<br> and gave herself in wedlock<br> to a wealthy yankee.<br> Better make it fast, Chavez.<br> You've only got<br> five minutes left.<br> No! No!<br> They can't.<br> They can't. I won't let them.<br> Better that it end.<br> Really it is.<br> Your mother and I<br> can't hurt you any longer.<br> Laura Belle wants<br> my little girl to go to her.<br> Yes, just a few more weeks...<br> and at last,<br> you'll have a home...<br> the mother you should have had.<br> No, you mustn't leave me.<br> You mustn't.<br> You've been a good child.<br> Through some miracle,<br> you're good...<br> and you're decent,<br> and you're strong.<br> And now you must prove<br> that you are strong.<br> You will do that for me,<br> won't you, darling?<br> No tears, no grief...<br> now or later.<br> Here. Keep this scarf.<br> Wear it sometimes.<br> Get her out of here, Chavez.<br> Listen to me, darling.<br> We've very little time.<br> I want you to lean<br> on Laura Belle...<br> make her your inspiration<br> and your guide.<br> And then one day,<br> you'll be the great lady...<br> I've always wanted you to be.<br> Promise me that.<br> I promise.<br> Cross your heart?<br> Cross my heart.<br> She'll love you.<br> I know she will.<br> And you must give her<br> all the love you've had for me.<br> Smile for me.<br> Now, now. Head high.<br> Strong.<br> Very strong.<br> All threats of hell<br> and hopes of paradise...<br> one thing at least<br> is certain...<br> this life flies.<br> One thing is certain,<br> and the rest is lies.<br> The flower that once<br> has bloomed forever dies.<br> Ready, Chavez?<br> Quite ready, sheriff.<br> Whoa!<br> I beg your pardon.<br> You can't be...<br> What's your name?<br> None of your business.<br> Sorry.<br> I really am sorry.<br> I wonder if I could...<br> I don't talk to no strangers.<br> That's a good rule generally,<br> I grant you, but...<br> in this case, it...<br> Come on.<br> Won't you answer<br> just one question?<br> What is it?<br> Did you see<br> a little southern tot...<br> on the Guadalupe coach?<br> No.<br> Are you sure?<br> She was traveling alone.<br> You said "one question."<br> I know, but it doesn't<br> seem unreasonable if you...<br> Now you go away<br> and leave me alone.<br> I know all about men like you.<br> Well...<br> Good morning.<br> Why couldn't they have been<br> a little more explicit...<br> about just which coach<br> they were sending her on?<br> Don't worry, Jesse.<br> I'll drive her out to the ranch<br> whenever she shows up.<br> Thanks, Lem.<br> You can't miss her.<br> She's one of those...<br> well-brought-up<br> southern children.<br> Probably be hungry<br> and crying her eyes out.<br> I'll give her some milk<br> and blow her nose for her.<br> Thanks again.<br> And... so long!<br> So long.<br> Give my regards to the old man.<br> I will.<br> Say hello to Laura Belle for me.<br> Wait!<br> Wait! Do you know<br> somebody named Laura Belle?<br> I said, do you know<br> somebody named Laura Belle?<br> None of your business.<br> It is my business.<br> I don't talk to no strangers.<br> You can answer<br> one question, can't you?<br> That won't hurt you none.<br> All right, one question.<br> But remember, just one.<br> I know all about girls like you.<br> Don't you dare say that.<br> Pearl.<br> How'd you know my name?<br> If you hadn't been so uppity...<br> I'd have known who you were<br> a long time ago.<br> Now come on. Get in.<br> Who are you?<br> My mother couldn't come<br> to meet you...<br> so I came in her place.<br> I'm Laura Belle's son...<br> the older one, Jesse.<br> There.<br> I'm sorry about<br> not recognizing you.<br> I guess your clothes<br> sort of fooled me.<br> Don't misunderstand me.<br> I think they're beautiful.<br> You do?<br> Yes, and very unusual.<br> But you know...<br> I think I'd like to see you<br> in brighter colors.<br> Like green?<br> I have a green blouse.<br> - Green, blue, yellow maybe.<br> - Yellow?<br> I have a real pretty<br> yellow one right here.<br> - I'll put it on now.<br> - Not now.<br> Save it for tomorrow.<br> Here's where the ranch starts.<br> There's the marker...<br> the Spanish Bit...<br> a million acres<br> of McCanles empire.<br> Empire? Isn't this still Texas?<br> Yes, but the Senator doesn't<br> always acknowledge that. Look.<br> He puts his seal<br> of ownership on everything.<br> It's on his sons, too,<br> I suppose.<br> In fact, I'm sure<br> my brother Lewt and I...<br> are the Senator's<br> favorite property.<br> Is your brother as nice<br> as you are?<br> Girls in town think he's nicer.<br> - Hiya, Jesse.<br> - Howdy, Jake.<br> Fine foals.<br> Is that your house?<br> That is the residence<br> of Jackson Tilt McCanles<br> and family.<br> And on to the fortress...<br> and happiness.<br> Jesse! Pearl!<br> Here you are.<br> Prettiest girl ever to set foot<br> on Spanish Bit.<br> Pearl, dear.<br> I'm so glad you've<br> come to us, darling.<br> Here, let me look at you.<br> Yes, you're Scott's daughter.<br> And now you're ours.<br> You're just like he said.<br> I'm afraid I'm somewhat<br> different than he remembered.<br> But come, dear.<br> Did you take good care<br> of her, Jesse?<br> I showed her all<br> the points of interest.<br> - He did. He's nice.<br> - I think so, too.<br> You southern belles<br> are all alike.<br> Where in holleration<br> you been all day?<br> I just went down<br> to Paradise Flats.<br> - Senator, this is Pearl.<br> - Who?<br> Pearl Chavez, our cousin.<br> You remember. We invited her<br> to come and stay with us.<br> Don't be scared.<br> You're not a trespasser.<br> She's no cousin of mine.<br> She's Scott Chavez's<br> daughter, ain't she?<br> Yes, of course she is.<br> Why don't you say so?<br> Girl, what are you doing<br> in that getup?<br> Is that the latest fashion...<br> with them aristocratic<br> cousins of yours?<br> Or is it what they're<br> wearing this season in wigwams?<br> Come on, boy.<br> We got to talk business.<br> See you later, Pearl.<br> Come, dear.<br> I'll take you to your room.<br> He don't want me here.<br> You mustn't mind the Senator.<br> He doesn't mean anything by it.<br> It's his way ever since...<br> ever since his accident.<br> Accident?<br> It's a long story...<br> and, I'm afraid,<br> not a very pleasant one.<br> I wish we had<br> a better room for you...<br> but later on,<br> we'll speak to the Senator.<br> Lewton, dear.<br> This is Pearl.<br> My youngest son... Lewton.<br> Pleased to meet you, Lewton.<br> Pleased to meet you...<br> Pearl.<br> Come, Pearl.<br> You and Lewton will have<br> plenty of time later on...<br> to get to know one another.<br> I'm sure we will.<br> Yay... boy.<br> Sounds of the rude world<br> Heard in the day<br> Lulled by the moonlight<br> Have all passed away<br> Beautiful dreamer<br> Queen of my song<br> List' while I woo thee...<br> Where will I put<br> your medicine, Mrs. McCanles?<br> Leave it on the table.<br> Mrs. McCanles,<br> can I get married?<br> But, Vashti, whom do<br> you want to marry?<br> Nobody in particular, ma'am.<br> I just thought I'd kind of<br> like to get married.<br> Of course, Vashti.<br> You may marry<br> whenever you wish.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Do you know anybody...<br> who would be nice<br> for me to marry?<br> No, I don't,<br> but I'll think about it.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> There's no particular hurry.<br> That Vashti.<br> I'm afraid I'll never be able<br> to train her properly.<br> And as to marriage...<br> Sit down.<br> I'm glad your father<br> sent you to me.<br> All you have to do<br> is behave like a lady.<br> Not that<br> Scott Chavez's daughter...<br> could ever be anything<br> but a lady.<br> I'm a good girl, ma'am.<br> Of course you are, dear,<br> but you see...<br> you'll be the only young girl<br> at Spanish Bit.<br> No one could blame you...<br> if your head<br> were turned a little.<br> You take Lewton, for instance.<br> He's such an attractive boy.<br> I think Jesse's much nicer.<br> But you scarcely know Lewton.<br> Of course, he's<br> a bit undisciplined...<br> but perhaps that's what gives<br> westerners their charm.<br> The Senator was like that.<br> That's why, when your father...<br> Jesse always chides me<br> for talking about the past.<br> I hope Jesse likes me.<br> We're going to lose him someday.<br> I've known that ever since<br> he came back from law school.<br> I've been so selfish.<br> He'd have gone long ago<br> if it weren't for me.<br> My firstborn... he's so good.<br> He's made such<br> a difference in my life.<br> - Ma'am?<br> - Yes, Pearl?<br> I'll be a good girl.<br> I promise I will.<br> I want to be like you.<br> That's what my father wanted.<br> I'm afraid neither<br> your father nor I...<br> found happiness, child.<br> I hope you will.<br> Come, child.<br> This is no way to begin.<br> Do you know this waltz?<br> Will you stop<br> that infernal instrument!<br> King me, Senator.<br> I always figured when I moved<br> into my own quarters...<br> I'd be rid of that noise.<br> I guess that's it, Senator.<br> I think I'll take me<br> a little stroll.<br> Now we got that papoose<br> to put up with.<br> I don't know.<br> She looks like<br> a pretty cute tamale to me.<br> You think so?<br> Wouldn't appeal to me none.<br> Of course, I always<br> liked my women more...<br> Say, Senator.<br> Yeah, Lewt?<br> You know that last trip<br> I took up to Abilene?<br> Yeah.<br> I was driving the herd all day<br> and kind of tired...<br> and felt like getting<br> some relaxation.<br> Yeah. Didn't happen<br> to drop into a place...<br> called the Last Chance, did you?<br> How did you find that out?<br> Sent them a check<br> for 1,600 just yesterday.<br> That's how I found out.<br> I guess I had<br> a few drinks too many.<br> That's all right.<br> A fella's got to sow<br> some wild oats sometime.<br> What's the money for?<br> Senator...<br> I hope someday I'll be like you.<br> The only thing<br> I don't like about you...<br> is the miserable way<br> you play poker.<br> Trying to fill inside straights<br> is a sucker's game.<br> Go on, boy. Go on. Run along.<br> What a boy.<br> How'd they come<br> to name you Pearl?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> Couldn't have had<br> much eye for color, could they?<br> They might better have called<br> you Pocahontas or Minnehaha.<br> Ain't that right?<br> I guess so.<br> All right, Minne, on your way.<br> Good night, sir.<br> Minne... ha ha.<br> Ha ha.<br> Hello, Pearl. What's the matter?<br> Are you unhappy?<br> Don't you like Spanish Bit?<br> If everybody was like you.<br> If everybody was like me,<br> the world would be...<br> a terribly frustrated<br> sort of place.<br> What do you mean?<br> Nothing for you to worry<br> your pretty little head about.<br> I want to learn.<br> Will you learn me?<br> Your ma says you're a lawyer.<br> I want to be a lady<br> and know everything, like her.<br> I wonder if learning<br> ever made mother any happier.<br> - I wish I could do that.<br> - What?<br> Make rings like that.<br> Can I try? Let me try.<br> No, Pearl. Now whoa.<br> Ladies aren't supposed to smoke.<br> Now you won't want<br> to learn me things, will you?<br> You don't like me<br> no more, do you?<br> Of course I do.<br> I'm afraid a lot of men<br> will want to learn you things.<br> I think you better go to bed...<br> like a good little girl.<br> We'll discuss your education<br> another time.<br> All right.<br> Good night, Pearl.<br> Good night, Jesse.<br> Good night.<br> What do you want?<br> I hate you!<br> Don't you pretend<br> nobody ever did that before.<br> They didn't.

And I'm gonna help you<br> take care of them, too.<br> Sure, you are.<br> Ain't they wonderful,<br> these babies?<br> Any kind of babies.<br> They sure are.<br> I remember reading something<br> once when I was a kid.<br> What?<br> You'd think I was silly...<br> a big galoot like me<br> spouting poetry.<br> No, Sam. Please.<br> I'm going to sit right here<br> until you tell me.<br> It goes something like this.<br> For everything created in<br> the bounds of earth and sky...<br> has such longing to be mated.<br> It must couple or must die.<br> That's the best poem<br> I ever heard.<br> I'm glad you like it.<br> You married?<br> Nope. Never run across<br> anybody I wanted to marry.<br> Besides, I never got up<br> nerve enough to ask anybody.<br> I guess you must be<br> getting pretty old.<br> Yep. Old enough to be<br> your father... and then some.<br> Why?<br> Nothing.<br> I guess, just the same...<br> there are plenty of women<br> who would marry you anyway.<br> I better be getting home.<br> Mrs. McCanles is kind of ailing.<br> You wouldn't marry me,<br> would you?<br> - What did you say?<br> - I said, would you marry me?<br> Don't get mad, please.<br> First time in my life<br> I got up some nerve.<br> How could a big galoot...<br> Don't say that.<br> You don't know about me.<br> If you did, you wouldn't ask.<br> You mean about Lewt?<br> So you know about<br> me and Lewt, too?<br> Yeah, I guess<br> ain't nobody don't know.<br> I've knocked around plenty...<br> - I'm trash, I tell you.<br> - Don't go telling me that.<br> I'd kill the first man<br> who said anything like that.<br> But I don't love you.<br> Don't that matter?<br> You've only known me<br> a little while.<br> I know I'm not something<br> girls dream about...<br> like the McCanleses.<br> - I'm not rich like them either.<br> - It ain't that.<br> But I'd love you,<br> and I'd take care of you.<br> I got a little money saved.<br> Get a little ranch<br> of our own, maybe.<br> Won't you even think<br> about it, honey? Please, honey.<br> Don't you call me "honey."<br> Lewt called me that.<br> You're all alike!<br> Coming?<br> I hope I didn't say nothing<br> to hurt your feelings.<br> That's all right.<br> I'll marry you<br> if you still want me to.<br> You mean it?<br> I declare. I never saw...<br> so many cows before<br> in all my life.<br> I'm afraid they're not<br> all cows, Helen.<br> Sometimes, my dear, I think...<br> that I didn't<br> bring you up properly.<br> All right. I understand.<br> All I need is a hint.<br> Those steers<br> are from Spanish Bit.<br> I thought your father's ranch<br> was hundreds of miles from here.<br> See? There's the brand.<br> They're on their way to market.<br> If it ain't<br> the big railroad man.<br> How's everything at the Bit?<br> Getting along just fine<br> since you left... Mr. McCanles.<br> Same old Sid.<br> I'll be inside, darling.<br> Come, father.<br> Hey, that Langford's daughter?<br> Heard you were<br> kind of sweet on her.<br> Yes, that's Miss Langford.<br> Pretty, ain't she?<br> We could use a few like her<br> around the ranch...<br> especially now that<br> Pearl's going... maybe.<br> What do you mean?<br> Darnest thing you ever heard.<br> She's getting married.<br> Can you imagine<br> anybody marrying Pearl?<br> Is she marrying Lewt?<br> Lewt? What would Lewt...<br> Nah, she's marrying Sam Pierce.<br> Pearl ought to be<br> very happy with Sam.<br> She ain't marrying him yet.<br> She ain't marrying nobody...<br> until Lewt decides<br> to give the bride away.<br> So long, Judas.<br> Can't say I like...<br> your Spanish Bit people<br> very much, if he's any criteria.<br> Darling, I've been thinking.<br> Why couldn't there be a spur<br> track right on Spanish Bit?<br> Then they could<br> just ship the cattle...<br> instead of driving them<br> all that distance.<br> You're not even<br> listening to me, dear.<br> Certainly I am.<br> You were saying...<br> You were asking if...<br> What were you saying?<br> I was trying to prove...<br> what a helpful wife<br> I'm going to be.<br> Give me a kiss.<br> I couldn't help overhearing.<br> What?<br> You liked that girl, didn't you?<br> You still like her?<br> I'm sure I'll always<br> be devoted to her.<br> Hope you'll like her, too.<br> But you were in love<br> with her, weren't you?<br> Yes, I was in love with her.<br> I said I was.<br> Jesse. Father.<br> Sometimes I think he didn't<br> bring you up properly.<br> What were you worried about<br> when I came out just now?<br> Worried? I was just wondering<br> what my brother Lewt might do.<br> Zeke, where's<br> my peppermint and soda?<br> Coming up now.<br> Hear you named the day.<br> That's right.<br> Ring just come in the last post.<br> Mighty pretty. Yep.<br> You sure are shot full of luck.<br> I'd like to stand<br> the drinks for everybody.<br> I'm getting married<br> in the morning.<br> That's fine.<br> Save your money, Pierce.<br> So you figure<br> you got yourself a wife.<br> I don't figure. I know I have.<br> Think you can keep her?<br> Reckon as how I can.<br> Cattle rustlers<br> and women rustlers.<br> Both of them steal...<br> what's got another man's<br> brand on it.<br> I don't think I like<br> the way you're talking.<br> Maybe I didn't rightly<br> understand you.<br> Yeah, you understand me<br> all right.<br> Pearl Chavez is my girl,<br> and she'll always be my girl...<br> just as long<br> as I want her to be.<br> From now you, you're gonna<br> respect Pearl's name.<br> If that ain't<br> the best joke yet.<br> He's defending the lady's name...<br> my girl's name.<br> Has anybody else around here...<br> got any fancy ideas<br> about Pearl Chavez?<br> Don't seem to be no takers.<br> I don't rightly know<br> much about Sam Pierce, O Lord...<br> but from what I hear...<br> he'll be needing<br> no introduction to you.<br> Seeing as how Sam was snatched<br> from his loved ones' arms...<br> before they even had time<br> to get a good grip on him...<br> I'm counting on you to give him<br> a better break up yonder.<br> Hey, you hatchet face!<br> Are you so almighty hungry<br> to hang one man...<br> that you can't wait till we<br> get through planting this one?<br> Now I be consigning him<br> to your keeping.<br> And I'm guessing<br> you'll find him...<br> the gentlest,<br> sweetest straw boss...<br> ever to enter the pearly gates.<br> Amen.<br> Start shoveling, cowpokes.<br> It's our fault.<br> We raised him wild.<br> If he'd only gone<br> to school, like Jesse.<br> I thought I asked you never<br> to mention Jesse's name again.<br> It's true.<br> You spoiled Lewt, and I let you.<br> Ever since he was a child...<br> he thought rules<br> weren't made for him.<br> He thought you made<br> the rules, all of them...<br> not just those<br> for Spanish Bit.<br> It's that Indian girl.<br> If you hadn't<br> brought her here...<br> none of this<br> would have happened.<br> Perhaps if your attitude<br> toward her had been different...<br> It's my fault, huh?<br> It's my fault.<br> You dared to bring<br> that Indian baggage...<br> right here into this house,<br> and now you try to tell me...<br> You get her out of here.<br> And what's more,<br> get her out of here tonight!<br> You've screamed at me<br> for the last time.<br> You made one of your sons<br> hate you and sent him away.<br> You made the other one<br> a... murderer.<br> Pearl will stay here<br> just as long as I do.<br> Here's the money.<br> You better clear out of here...<br> until this thing blows over.<br> Thanks, pa.<br> It's gonna take<br> plenty of fixing.<br> So you better<br> stay away from here...<br> until I send you the word.<br> It'll take a year maybe.<br> Maybe more than that even.<br> I'm sorry to cause you<br> all this trouble.<br> If you get me out of this one...<br> Never mind that.<br> I ain't counting<br> on no reformation.<br> Go on. Get going fast.<br> Good-bye, pa.<br> So long, Sid.<br> So long, Lewt.<br> Take care of yourself, son.<br> I will, pa.<br> Yay, boy.<br> Now here's a chance<br> to do something for pa.<br> I've been working<br> on the railroad<br> All the live-long day<br> Come on, Sid. Come on.<br> You ain't got the mint<br> on this game.<br> Sorry, Senator.<br> You certainly stuck your head<br> in a noose that time.<br> Pearl, honey.<br> What you doing with that thing?<br> There ain't nobody here but me.<br> I'm gonna kill you.<br> That wouldn't be a very ladylike<br> thing to do, would it...<br> after me riding thirty miles<br> just for a kiss?<br> You're gonna get<br> what you gave Sam Pierce.<br> That just goes to show you...<br> there ain't no gratitude<br> for nothing.<br> If it wasn't for me,<br> you'd be tied up...<br> with that brokendown<br> cowhand right now.<br> You might as well marry pa.<br> Sam Pierce was a good man,<br> and you're a skunk.<br> Of all the ornery females.<br> One minute you're yammering...<br> because I don't<br> love you enough...<br> and when I go out<br> and show you how much I do...<br> you're wanting to plug me.<br> You're my girl, honey.<br> I was your girl.<br> Anybody who was my girl<br> is still my girl.<br> That's the kind of guy I am.<br> You know... loyal.<br> Stay back.<br> There ain't nobody<br> gonna take my girl.<br> Nobody.<br> Never.<br> I'm saving you, tiger cat.<br> Just when I figure<br> I'm doing fine and dandy...<br> I start thinking about you,<br> and nothing else is any good.<br> Here.<br> What's going on around here?<br> Come in.<br> Howdy, Senator.<br> Sorry to be busting in<br> on you like this.<br> It's all right, sheriff.<br> How's tricks?<br> How's the law-breaking<br> business?<br> Pretty quiet... since Lewt left.<br> Yeah, pretty dull<br> without him around.<br> Ain't heard from him lately,<br> have you, Senator?<br> Lewt? Here. Have a bite.<br> Don't mind if I do.<br> Wish I could afford this brand.<br> The next batch I get,<br> I'll send you some.<br> No, I ain't heard<br> a word from Lewt...<br> since he was attacked<br> by that no-account Sam Pierce.<br> How's your other son<br> feel about it?<br> I ain't got no other son.<br> Funny thing... one of the boys...<br> Lewt? I wish it was so.<br> Don't mind if I have<br> a look around, do you?<br> No. Go ahead, sheriff.<br> You got your duties to do.<br> I'm sorry you're gonna have<br> your trouble for nothing.<br> I hear Mrs. McCanles<br> has been feeling kind of poorly.<br> It ain't nothing.<br> Just getting<br> a little old, I guess.<br> You reckon the missus<br> would mind...<br> if I kind of<br> looked around her room?<br> No. Why should she mind?<br> Go ahead.<br> Sid, ain't you moved yet?<br> Come in.<br> - Evening, ma'am.<br> - Sheriff.<br> Sorry to disturb<br> your privacy, ma'am.<br> Sheriff Thompson, what is it?<br> It's really nothing, ma'am.<br> One of the boys<br> had a fool notion...<br> that Lewt was around here.<br> I'm afraid if Lewton<br> were around...<br> I'd be the last person<br> to know it.<br> Sorry.<br> Oh, my sons.<br> My sons.<br> Let's try this one.<br> Who's that?<br> Is that you, girl?<br> What do you want?<br> It's me... Sheriff Thompson.<br> You ain't seen Lewt, have you?<br> Lewt? That murdering,<br> sneaking no-account.<br> I wish I could see him.<br> I reckon you do.<br> I was forgetting<br> about Sam Pierce.<br> Sorry.<br> Good night.<br> See you at the hanging.<br> Poor old Mac.<br> He don't know how close he came<br> to getting plugged.<br> Be quiet. It ain't safe yet.<br> It ain't safe for them,<br> you mean.<br> There they go now.<br> I think I'll light out<br> for Mexico.<br> Mexico?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm gonna grab me a ranch...<br> that'll make this place<br> look like a gopher hole.<br> It would be like heaven,<br> being in Mexico together.<br> I'll show these<br> heel-squatters around here...<br> a thing or two about ranching.<br> You can do it, too.<br> - Lewt.<br> - Huh?<br> - Go saddle my pinto.<br> - What for?<br> - While I get ready.<br> - Ready for what?<br> I'm going with you, of course.<br> Hurry up.<br> You wouldn't like it<br> down there, honey.<br> Sure, I will. I'll be<br> a big help to you, too.<br> I can cook, and I can shoot<br> as good as you...<br> and I never get tired riding.<br> You'll try to stop me<br> from doing things...<br> yammering about me<br> maybe getting shot...<br> or start all over again<br> about marrying somebody.<br> No. I promise I won't never say<br> another word about marrying.<br> You'll probably<br> want to go with me...<br> every time I feel<br> like going on a bust...<br> or playing me some poker.<br> I wouldn't, honest.<br> Just so long<br> as I could be near you.<br> I'm gonna live my own way.<br> Nobody's gonna hog-tie me.<br> Please.<br> I'll come back<br> every once in a while...<br> and see you, like tonight.<br> I'll do anything you say.<br> Honey, I love you.

Please, honey!<br> - Shut up!<br> - Lewt, honey, please!<br> Begging your pardon, ma'am...<br> I'd like to say<br> all us boys at the Bit...<br> is praying mighty hard<br> that you get...<br> All right, Ken. All right now.<br> You just wait downstairs.<br> I'll let you know<br> when I need you.<br> Will you thank the boys for me?<br> Tell them it isn't<br> quite as hard to go...<br> as they may think.<br> What are you<br> talking that way for?<br> Anybody would think<br> you was dying.<br> I'm a nuisance to you<br> even to the end.<br> It's the first time<br> you've been in this room...<br> since that night.<br> Don't bring that up.<br> I never had the courage<br> to discuss it with you before...<br> but it doesn't matter now.<br> I've paid for my mistake.<br> You've hated me<br> all through the years.<br> You paid? What about me,<br> with these legs?<br> As useless as a hog-tied steer.<br> And all because you<br> couldn't stand to be...<br> mistress of the biggest<br> ranch in Texas.<br> And why? I'll tell you why.<br> Nobody needed to tell me...<br> who you was running away to<br> that night.<br> Nobody needed to tell me<br> you was running to Chavez.<br> That's not true. It's not true.<br> I was running away,<br> but not to Scott.<br> Not to Scott.<br> True or not, you left me.<br> And true or not,<br> I went after you...<br> like any lovesick,<br> half-baked boy would do.<br> I'd give anything...<br> anything to undo it.<br> I loved you, Laura Belle.<br> Yes, sir, I loved you.<br> Kept on saying to myself<br> all through the years...<br> that I hated you,<br> until finally I did hate you.<br> In my heart,<br> I knew all the time...<br> it wasn't your fault, though.<br> It was my fault.<br> It was my jealousy<br> that made me like I was...<br> hard and cruel-like...<br> till I guess<br> you had to leave me.<br> I never should have<br> gone out after you that night.<br> But when I found out<br> you was gone...<br> I got to thinking<br> you was going to him...<br> and I couldn't stand it.<br> I swore I'd stop you<br> and bring you back.<br> I went crazy.<br> Yes, that's what it was.<br> I just went crazy.<br> And I rode through the night<br> like a drunken Comanche.<br> It was my own crazy jealousy<br> that threw me off that horse.<br> Jackson, forgive me.<br> Look at me.<br> You're my husband... my very own.<br> Hiya, boys.<br> - It's Jesse.<br> - Well, I'll be.<br> He's got a lot of gall,<br> coming back here.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> I thought I told you<br> to keep out of my sight.<br> I just found out<br> my mother is dying...<br> and I came to see her,<br> and I intend to see her.<br> They tell me<br> you're the big noise now...<br> with them trespassing thieves.<br> I hope my good fortune<br> doesn't distress you too much.<br> They're even talking<br> about putting you...<br> up for public office.<br> They must pay high<br> for double-crossers.<br> Senator,<br> let's not discuss that.<br> I'm afraid we<br> see things differently.<br> Nothing on earth<br> would bring me here...<br> You're mighty lucky my men<br> didn't take a shot at you.<br> That was their orders.<br> I was about to say<br> that nothing on earth...<br> would bring me back here<br> except mother.<br> Is she in her room?<br> - No, she ain't in her room.<br> - Where is she?<br> You'll find her right in there,<br> in a long pine box.<br> Hello, Vashti.<br> - Mr. Jesse...<br> - No, thank you.<br> But Mrs. McCanles,<br> she said to me once...<br> "Vashti, you be sure and see<br> that Mr. Jesse eats proper..."<br> You've been a good friend.<br> I shan't forget it.<br> Poor Mrs. McCanles.<br> I wonder if Miss Pearl<br> would mind if you woke her up.<br> I have to go away soon.<br> I would like to see her.<br> What's the matter?<br> Didn't you hear me?<br> Yes, I heared you.<br> Only I'm certain sure<br> the devil hisself...<br> has been chasing Miss Pearl.<br> What on earth<br> are you talking about?<br> Mrs. McCanles, she treated<br> Miss Pearl awful good.<br> She treated everybody<br> awful good, even me.<br> And after she went to heaven...<br> Miss Pearl looks like she's had<br> a spell or something.<br> She wouldn't eat nothing.<br> She wouldn't talk to nobody.<br> She just stared and stared...<br> at Mrs. McCanles lying there<br> so still-like.<br> She ran to the barn...<br> and wouldn't come out<br> for nobody.<br> Poor Pearl.<br> She's sad.<br> I listened at the barn door...<br> and I heared her weeping<br> something awful.<br> I want you to do<br> something for me.<br> Yes?<br> Go and fix Miss Pearl<br> a hot breakfast.<br> Yes!<br> And I want you to pack<br> Miss Pearl's things.<br> Yes, ma'am! Yes, sir!<br> Go away.<br> Vashti said you wouldn't<br> come into the house...<br> and I couldn't believe her.<br> Leave me alone.<br> Have you gone out of your mind?<br> What are you doing out here<br> in the stable?<br> I bet your pa would think<br> it was too good for me.<br> Never mind what he thinks.<br> I'm not going to allow you...<br> Don't you worry none about me.<br> I'm going away from here.<br> - Really? Where are you going?<br> - It ain't your business.<br> Me and Dice<br> will get along all right.<br> Of course, there's Lewt.<br> He'll be paying a visit here...<br> sooner or later,<br> if I know Lewt.<br> That's right, I'm Lewt's girl.<br> You can't forget that, can you?<br> What makes you think that?<br> That's what you said that night.<br> You said you'd never forget it.<br> I did say that, didn't I?<br> It worried me sometimes<br> to think I'd made so much of it.<br> I hope it didn't make<br> any difference.<br> It didn't make no difference.<br> You're right. I'm Lewt's girl.<br> It's all I ever was.<br> It's all I ever could be.<br> You love him, don't you?<br> Love him? I hate him.<br> I wish they'd hang him.<br> I wish they'd hang him fast.<br> Yes. After all you've<br> been through, I suppose...<br> It ain't just his fault.<br> If he sent for me tonight,<br> I guess I'd go to him.<br> Lewt's not sending for you<br> tonight or any other night.<br> Listen, I have to be<br> in Paradise Flats...<br> a few days on business.<br> Do you want to wait here<br> until I go to Austin...<br> or would you like to<br> come with me right now?<br> Me? You're just<br> being sorry for me.<br> You don't have to be<br> sorry for me none!<br> Listen to me.<br> I won't have you thinking that.<br> It's you who are feeling<br> sorry for yourself.<br> I told Helen long ago<br> I wanted to get you out of here.<br> You told her?<br> Yes. She wants to be<br> your friend.<br> After your ma died...<br> I just didn't want to<br> go on living no more.<br> I know what you mean.<br> You'll like Helen,<br> and she'll like you, too.<br> You just wait and see.<br> She's a lady, ain't she?<br> Like your ma.<br> She's a lady,<br> like you're going to be.<br> No, I can't be no more.<br> Of course you can.<br> We'll just pretend...<br> the whole thing<br> was just a bad dream.<br> That's all it was actually,<br> a nightmare.<br> If only I could be good again!<br> Look at me.<br> Remember when you<br> wanted to learn...<br> when you wanted me to help you?<br> I know just the school for you.<br> School?<br> What's the matter?<br> Don't you still want to learn?<br> I'll do anything.<br> I'll cook for you.<br> I'll wash Miss Helen's clothes.<br> You'll do nothing of the sort.<br> You'll learn to waltz<br> and make small talk...<br> and have pretty dresses.<br> Here.<br> For me?<br> From mother to you.<br> Jesse, I...<br> I wish...<br> I wish I could die for you.<br> Let's hope you never<br> have to do that.<br> Is that you, Judas?<br> I got a message<br> from your brother...<br> the McCanles with the guts.<br> What's the matter<br> with the bad man?<br> Can't he deliver<br> his messages in person?<br> He has some business<br> tonight... with a train.<br> He just plumb don't like trains.<br> So I've heard.<br> Have you become his assistant?<br> We keep in touch<br> with each other.<br> You should have seen his face...<br> when I told him<br> you have Chavez with you.<br> I bet it was<br> a lovely sight to behold.<br> What's the message?<br> He says I'm to bring her<br> back with me... pronto.<br> Suppose she doesn't feel up<br> to making the trip?<br> He says if she don't<br> come back...<br> he's coming here<br> tomorrow morning...<br> bright and early and get her.<br> You seem to be<br> a capable messenger.<br> Would you mind<br> carrying back a reply?<br> Not at all. Glad to oblige.<br> You can tell my beloved brother<br> that I'll wait for him here.<br> I should have the sheriff<br> waiting for him...<br> but I prefer to meet him alone.<br> - Is that a promise?<br> - You're not talking to Lewt.<br> That's near enough.<br> I'm giving you one more chance.<br> Send Pearl out here...<br> or I'll plug you<br> from here to breakfast.<br> Just what do you think<br> Pearl's doing here with me?<br> Don't give me any...<br> of your high and mighty<br> noble talk, big words.<br> You think I wouldn't shoot you<br> because you ain't got a gun?<br> I wouldn't credit you<br> with any such compunctions.<br> I'm riding back<br> to that hitching post...<br> and then turning<br> and starting to shoot.<br> It's more than you did<br> for Sam Pierce.<br> Why all the consideration?<br> Just don't want them<br> fancy friends of yours...<br> to say you had a brother<br> who shot you down in cold blood.<br> You're going to hang.<br> You're going to hang<br> by the neck until you're dead!<br> You'll just go on<br> killing and killing...<br> till they kill you.<br> I hope Pearl gives you<br> a pretty funeral.<br> - Who's that?<br> - Just me... Lem Smoot.<br> Come here to gloat over me, huh?<br> You can turn right around<br> and get out of here.<br> I came because I thought maybe<br> you'd be needing a friend.<br> There's a funny glow in the sky<br> tonight, ain't there?<br> I remember once hearing<br> one of them Indian legends...<br> about how their ancestors<br> lit bonfires in the sky...<br> when a chief's son was a-dyin'.<br> He's dying?<br> It don't surprise me none.<br> Lewt always was a good shot.<br> It looks like<br> them ancestors of yours...<br> have to put out those bonfires.<br> What do you mean?<br> I guess Jesse's a little tougher<br> than you thought.<br> Thank God.<br> I thought I knew you<br> better than that.<br> I know how fond you were<br> of those boys...<br> and how proud<br> of them you were.<br> It don't seem possible...<br> but I must have been wrong<br> about a whole lot of things.<br> Laura Belle warned me<br> I was spoiling Lewt...<br> but I wouldn't listen to her.<br> Look. You see<br> them plains and hills?<br> I was so almighty proud...<br> of what I carved<br> out of this country.<br> I figured<br> I was building something...<br> for Lewt and Jesse.<br> And what have I got now?<br> Lewt a murderer, an outlaw.<br> Jesse...<br> Jesse would come back<br> any time you want him to.<br> You think so?<br> He told me to tell you so.<br> I'm just a lonely old man<br> who needs a friend...<br> like you said.<br> Whoa!<br> Here's your luggage, miss.<br> You're Miss Helen, ain't you?<br> And you're Pearl.<br> He's been asking for you.<br> How is he?<br> He's... gonna be all right.<br> Thank heaven.<br> I shouldn't cry. I know it.<br> He wouldn't like it.<br> You couldn't do nothing<br> he wouldn't like.<br> You're very fond<br> of Jesse, aren't you?<br> After my pa...<br> There wasn't never nobody<br> good to me like my pa...<br> Except Mrs. McCanles...<br> and Jesse.<br> My dear.<br> You will come<br> and live with us, won't you?<br> I want you to.<br> Yes?<br> I'm glad you and Jesse<br> are... bespoken.<br> Thank you.<br> Hi, Pearl.<br> How's the hero?<br> I just heard<br> he was gonna pull through.<br> Tough luck, ain't it?<br> But Lewt will get him next time.<br> You can bank on that.<br> - Next time?<br> - Yeah.<br> Next time.<br> I got good news for you.<br> Yeah? What is it?<br> It's from Lewt.<br> He says you got to<br> hightail it out of here...<br> if you want to<br> kiss him good-bye...<br> before he beats it<br> across the border.<br> You mean it? Where is he?<br> I kind of figured<br> you'd like that.<br> He's hiding out<br> at Squaw's Head Rock.<br> You got that? Squaw's Head Rock.<br> Just fire two shots<br> when you get there.<br> I got it. Squaw's Head Rock.<br> Take the Apache trail<br> to the mission.<br> Any Indian there can tell you<br> how to get to Buffalo Ridge.<br> And then you...<br> You got a good horse?<br> It's a couple of days' ride.<br> Sure. I got my pinto.<br> You know, the one Lewt gave me<br> before I was his girl.<br> Hiya, Pearl!<br> Here I am!<br> I've been waiting for you!<br> Hello, honey!<br> I'll be right down!<br> Stay there!<br> I can't see you!<br> Can you see me?<br> You... double-crossing... bobcat!<br> I guess that does it.<br> You got me that time.<br> I'm done for.<br> You're lying.<br> You're lying,<br> like you always do!<br> I can't shoot no more, honey.<br> Honest.<br> I'm not scared of you.<br> I'm coming up after you.<br> All right, then. Come on up!<br> No use in my...<br> lying no more.<br> I'm through.<br> You hear me?<br> Yeah.<br> I'm dying.<br> I...<br> I'm going... fast.<br> Are you...<br> Ain't you coming up?<br> I want to see you.<br> I got to see you.<br> Where are you?<br> Where are you?<br> Hurry!<br> Please!<br> I... I got to...<br> hold you... just once more.<br> I love you.<br> I love you!<br> Hurry. Hurry!<br> Hurry, honey.<br> Hold on! Hold on!<br> Hurry!<br> Wait for me!<br> Wait for me.<br> Where are you?<br> You always said you could shoot.<br> I never believed you.<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Don't cry, honey.<br> Don't cry.<br> I had to do it.<br> Of course you did.<br> Let me hold you.<br> Let me...<br> Just hold me.<br> Hold me once more.<br> Little... bobcat.<br>
