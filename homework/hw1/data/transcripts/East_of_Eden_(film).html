                        Nice fat deposit.<br> You're sure in the right business, Sally.<br> Thank you.<br> Good morning.<br> Deposit.<br> Another nice deposit.<br> You and Sally are sure<br> in the right business.<br> I'm in a hurry, please.<br> Hi, Kate.<br> Have you cleaned up the house<br> across the way?<br> I haven't had time yet.<br> You should always do that one first.<br> Anne!<br> Come here.<br> Did you ever see that kid out there before?<br> I think maybe he was in the bar last night.<br> Send Joe in.<br> Joe.<br> Hello, Pretty Boy.<br> - Call me, Kate?<br> - Yeah. Take a look out the window.<br> There's a kid who's been following me<br> all the way to the bank and back.<br> Come here, you young squirt, come here.<br> - You want me?<br> - What's the idea of throwing that stone?<br> Any law against throwing stones?<br> You're tough? Come here!<br> What are you hanging around here for,<br> anyway?<br> - Would she talk to me?<br> - Kate?<br> What for? What do you want?<br> Just wanna talk to her.<br> - What do you want, you?<br> - Nothing.<br> You live around here?<br> - In Monterey?<br> - Salinas.<br> What's your name?<br> You're not talking? Now, look...<br> why are you following Kate around?<br> What's the idea, squirt?<br> Any law against following<br> around the town...<br> madam, whatever you call her?<br> I don't know if there's any law against it,<br> but she don't like it.<br> She owns that house over there, too,<br> don't she?<br> But don't you go hanging<br> around there, squirt. You're too young.<br> Now come on. Now beat it.<br> Is that her real name?<br> - Kate. Is that her real name?<br> - Sure, as far as I know. Why?<br> What's her last name?<br> Nobody's got any last name<br> around here, kid. Why?<br> You tell her I hate her.<br> I should have gone right on in there.<br> Should have gone right on in there<br> and talked to her.<br> Cal wasn't home all night.<br> Boy, is he gonna catch it from Dad.<br> - You know what the girls in class call him?<br> - No, what?<br> The Prowler.<br> - I'll tell him that.<br> - You better not, Aron.<br> - Promise me you won't.<br> - Why not?<br> Please don't. I don't want you...<br> - Hi, Cal.<br> - Hi.<br> Hello, Cal.<br> Excuse me for talking.<br> We're going down to see the icehouse<br> that Dad's gonna buy.<br> - Do you want to come?<br> - What icehouse?<br> The one he's buying<br> to freeze the vegetables with.<br> He's been talking about it every night<br> for the last week.<br> Is Dad gonna be there?<br> Why sure, he's gonna buy it.<br> I'll skip it.<br> You're gonna have<br> to see him sometime, Cal.<br> - Come on.<br> - Hey, Aron.<br> Yeah?<br> - Why don't you ask me where I've been?<br> - Would you tell me?<br> - No.<br> - Then what's the use of my asking?<br> - Is Dad mad at me?<br> - Well, you were out all night.<br> He was worried.<br> Yeah, I bet.<br> You gonna come or not?<br> Okay. I'll see you at supper.<br> He's coming.<br> He's coming.<br> You see, Will, I got the idea<br> from an article I read.<br> They dug up a mastodon<br> somewhere in Siberia.<br> Been in the ice for thousands of years<br> and the meat was still good.<br> Mastodon?<br> What have you got to say for yourself?<br> This is my son, Cal.<br> When you were his age,<br> I imagine you thought it only right...<br> to let your father know<br> before you stayed out all night.<br> Or at least to offer some kind<br> of apology when you did come home.<br> Well, times change.<br> As I was saying,<br> a mastodon is a kind of elephant.<br> Hasn't lived on the Earth for a long while.<br> - And the meat was still fresh?<br> - Sweet as a pork chop.<br> You're more excited about this<br> than you've been for a long time.<br> Now, I seem to be, don't I?<br> See, Will, I've been sort of<br> in a rut out there in the ranch.<br> - Sixteen, 17 years, I've kept out of things.<br> - I know.<br> But now I feel that<br> if I could only do something...<br> some little thing for, before I die,<br> some little thing for progress...<br> for people, maybe.<br> Call it anything you want.<br> I might make up for all the years<br> I've been lying fallow.<br> So, lately I've been reading up all I can<br> about refrigeration.<br> And I can't get it out of my head<br> that you can keep anything good...<br> as long as you can get it cold enough.<br> Like that mastodon there.<br> - Good afternoon, Abra.<br> - Good afternoon, Mr. Trask.<br> - Hello, Mr. Hamilton.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Son.<br> - Hi, Dad.<br> Now my son, Aron, that is,<br> thinks I may have a good idea here.<br> Dad wrapped a head of lettuce<br> in wax paper...<br> and kept it in our icebox<br> for over three weeks...<br> and it still came out fresh and good.<br> Right?<br> Quite right, Son.<br> - Dad, is it all right if we look around?<br> - 'Course, Aron. Belongs to us now.<br> Do you know where the biggest market<br> for vegetables is in the winter?<br> - Where?<br> - New York City.<br> And they can't raise them there.<br> But the railroad had promised me<br> those fruit cars.<br> Don't you have anything to say to me, Cal?<br> - Yeah.<br> - It's about time. Well?<br> I read in the Monterey newspaper...<br> that if we get into this war...<br> there are gonna be some fortunes made.<br> But you're gonna make them<br> in beans and corn, and stuff like that.<br> - You don't need all this ice.<br> - You're perfectly right.<br> Beans are up to 3 cents.<br> You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.<br> And they keep, too, don't they?<br> But I'm not particularly interested<br> in making a profit, Cal.<br> Look here, Will.<br> I'm not an inventor nor a scientist...<br> but I know I have an idea here.<br> I come from a whole family of inventors.<br> People full of ideas like this one.<br> I'm the only one that didn't have an idea...<br> and the only one that ever made a dime.<br> You wanna make a profit, you plant beans.<br> Put out that cigarette!<br> That place is full of sawdust!<br> - Come on, Adam, he's just thoughtless.<br> - Thoughtless? He's inconsiderate.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm at my rope's end with that boy.<br> I don't understand him. I never have.<br> Aron I've understood since he was a child.<br> Help me up.<br> - He doesn't like anybody, does he?<br> - Who, Dad?<br> No, Cal.<br> It's dark in here and spooky.<br> Why is he so alone all the time?<br> - He wants to be.<br> - Nobody wants to be alone all the time.<br> Dad's made a wonderful buy, hasn't he?<br> We'll freeze vegetables.<br> It'll really give him something<br> to live for now.<br> What's the matter, Abra,<br> don't you like Cal?<br> - I guess I don't know him very well.<br> - I love him.<br> Well, naturally, he's your brother.<br> He's scary.<br> - Scary?<br> - When he looks at you.<br> Sort of like an animal.<br> I don't know, he scares me.<br> Aron, when are we gonna get married?<br> Just as soon as I get through<br> with that darned school.<br> I wish it was right now.<br> - So do I.<br> - Do you?<br> Abra.<br> - When we get...<br> - I love you, Aron.<br> When we get married,<br> it's going to be perfect.<br> Everything about it is going to be perfect.<br> You're gonna make<br> a wonderful mother, Abra.<br> - I hope so.<br> - You are.<br> A perfect one.<br> You don't remember your mother at all,<br> do you, Aron?<br> No, she died<br> right after Cal and I were born.<br> Must be hard never to have had a mother.<br> - What's that?<br> - Look, what's he doing up there?<br> - Crazy guy.<br> - He's watching us.<br> - No, he isn't.<br> - Yes, he is, too.<br> Let's move over here. Aron.<br> - He's not watching us.<br> - I feel as if he can still see us.<br> I love you, Aron.<br> Really, I do. Really.<br> Sure. I love you, too.<br> Cal, stop! Stop that, Cal!<br> What are you doing? Stop it!<br> "Blessed is he<br> whose transgression is forgiven...<br> "whose sin is covered.<br> "Blessed is the man unto whom<br> the Lord imputeth not iniquity...<br> "and in whose spirit there is no guile."<br> And you are forgiven, Cal.<br> I think there is no iniquity<br> in your actions...<br> only something I do not know.<br> Why did you push that ice down?<br> I don't know.<br> Was it...<br> Was it vengeance? Anger?<br> Fear that I would punish you<br> for not coming home last night?<br> What was it?<br> I wanted to see it slide down the chute.<br> - Perhaps you had better read from here on.<br> - I'll read it, Dad.<br> No, it's for Cal to read.<br> Start at the fifth verse.<br> Verse 5.<br> "I acknowledge my sin unto thee,<br> and mine iniquity have I not hid.<br> "I said, I will confess my transgressions<br> unto the Lord...<br> "and thou forgavest<br> the iniquity of my sin. Selah."<br> Go on.<br> Six.<br> And I suggest a little slower, Cal.<br> And you don't have to read<br> the verse numbers.<br> "For this shall every one that is godly<br> pray unto thee.<br> "And surely in the floods of great waters...<br> "they shall not come nigh unto him.<br> Selah."<br> Seven.<br> Not the numbers, Cal.<br> "Thou art my hiding place,<br> thou shalt preserve me from trouble...<br> "thou shalt compass me about<br> with songs of deliverance. Selah."<br> - Eight.<br> - You have no repentance! You're bad!<br> Through and through, bad.<br> Excuse me. I'll go out and wait for Abra.<br> You're right. I am bad.<br> I knew that for a long time.<br> I didn't mean that, Cal. I spoke in anger.<br> Well, it's true.<br> Aron's the good one.<br> I guess there's just a certain amount...<br> of good and bad you get<br> from your parents...<br> - and I just got the bad.<br> - That's not true.<br> Cal, listen to me.<br> You can make of yourself<br> anything you want.<br> It's up to you. A man has a choice.<br> That's where he's different from an animal.<br> You don't listen. You'll never remember.<br> My mother...<br> she's not dead and gone to heaven...<br> is she?<br> Why do you ask that?<br> She's not dead at all.<br> She's not buried in the East<br> like you said, either.<br> She's alive.<br> - What makes you think so?<br> - I heard from a guy.<br> - Who?<br> - I don't know his name.<br> He was just passing through.<br> How come you told Aron and me she died?<br> - I thought it would save you pain.<br> - Pain?<br> If she was still alive,<br> where do you think she'd be?<br> I have no idea. She went East.<br> How do you know?<br> When she left the ranch we lived on<br> when you and Aron were born...<br> I heard she went East.<br> What was she like? Was she bad?<br> I guess she...<br> I never really knew what she was like.<br> She wasn't like other people.<br> There was something she seemed to lack.<br> Kindness, maybe. Conscience.<br> I never knew what she was after.<br> - How come she left you?<br> - I never knew that, either.<br> She was so full of hate.<br> - Hate for you?<br> - For everything.<br> You won't tell Aron that she didn't die?<br> No.<br> Must not do anything to hurt Aron.<br> Where'd you get that scar<br> you got on your shoulder, Father?<br> I've told you, Cal.<br> It's an old wound I got<br> in the Indian campaigns.<br> - Why do you ask that now?<br> - What'd she look like? Was she pretty?<br> She had the most lovely hands.<br> Like ivory.<br> She took such good care of them.<br> Her mother had arthritis.<br> She was always afraid<br> it would come to her in her hands.<br> Talk to me, Father.<br> I got to know who I am.<br> I got to know who I'm like.<br> I got to know...<br> Where is she?<br> I'm telling you, truthfully, Cal...<br> after she left, I never heard from her.<br> Cal, wait. I want to talk more with you.<br> If you leave this room now<br> we may never be able to talk again.<br> You coming home tonight, Cal?<br> What's the difference?<br> You're home. You're the one he wants.<br> Good evening, Cal.<br> High strung. Very high strung.<br> Good evening, Abra.<br> Where is my chess victim?<br> - He's waiting for you, Mr. Albrecht.<br> - Good.<br> What do you suppose he meant by that?<br> Go on, beat it!<br> Your wife has called up three times.<br> - My wife's a...<br> - I know she is. Now beat it.<br> Joe!<br> All right, fella, you've run out of money.<br> Mr. Hawks.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I want...<br> - What do you want to drink?<br> - Beer.<br> Hey!<br> - Where's my drink?<br> - All right.<br> That's not very neat, is...<br> It's okay.<br> - You'd better get out of here.<br> - How come?<br> You're the one who followed Kate<br> this morning.<br> - It's a free country, isn't it?<br> - It's a free country.<br> Only, Joe said if I saw you again,<br> I was supposed to tell him.<br> You can tell him if you want to.<br> You're just a kid, ain't you?<br> - I'm older than you are.<br> - Yeah, sure, but that isn't...<br> - Hey!<br> - All right.<br> Kid, please...<br> you oughtn't to go around<br> throwing stones and things.<br> That isn't nice. And drinking beer.<br> There's Joe.<br> Look, kid, please go.<br> You don't want to get yourself hurt.<br> You could tell him now, if you want to.<br> There's your chance.<br> You sure have got a nerve, haven't you?<br> - Do you know Kate?<br> - This is Kate's place.<br> - She's treating you okay?<br> - Sure.<br> I gotta go now, kid.<br> Is she nice?<br> Don't let Joe see you, please.<br> She doesn't treat you rough<br> or anything, does she?<br> Please, kid, I gotta go now.<br> It was nice meeting you.<br> Isn't there anything nice about her at all?<br> What's the matter, kid?<br> - She had pretty hands. Did you see them?<br> - Hands?<br> Did you look at them?<br> No, I don't think I ever saw them.<br> She always wears gloves.<br> Where is she?<br> - You mean now?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Back in her office, probably.<br> - Where's that?<br> Back that way.<br> Will you show me?<br> Look, kid, please don't start any trouble.<br> I'm not gonna start any trouble. Come on.<br> We... You can just point the door to me,<br> and I'll go there.<br> No, honest.<br> This is a tough place. I can't lose this job.<br> - I'm not very good at it, anyway.<br> - You won't lose it.<br> If I step out of line<br> Kate will throw me out on my ear.<br> Come on, will you?<br> You can just show me where the door is.<br> Come on.<br> Be a sport.<br> Come on.<br> There's the door.<br> Thank you. You can go back now.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> Please, kid, don't make any trouble.<br> I'm not gonna make any trouble.<br> I'm gonna wait till you're gone. Okay?<br> Will you let me talk to you? Please.<br> I gotta talk to you.<br> Joe!<br> Get out of here! Joe! Tex!<br> Call the sheriff! Get him out!<br> Call the sheriff! Get him out of here!<br> I want to talk to her!<br> I want to talk to you!<br> Please, talk to me!<br> Talk to me, please! Mother!<br> Is there any law against a guy<br> trying to see his own mother?<br> No, I guess there isn't.<br> Here.<br> Put this on your cheek. Here.<br> Drink some coffee.<br> How did you find out about Kate, anyway?<br> That guy I saw you talking to<br> in the bar the other night?<br> The one they call "Rabbit."<br> I thought so. He never was any good.<br> I remember when he used<br> to work on your father's ranch.<br> Well, he won't be around anymore, Cal.<br> He's left town for good.<br> - What do you hang around bars for?<br> - Any law against hanging...<br> Yes, there is! I'm the law.<br> Get that through your head.<br> Shut up!<br> Does Adam know that you...<br> roam around over here at night?<br> Adam's an old friend of mine,<br> you know, Cal, from...<br> way back in his ranch days.<br> I was afraid when you moved here<br> last year...<br> that you might find out something<br> about Kate.<br> But then she was over here on the Bay...<br> and you were way over on the other side<br> of the mountains in Salinas.<br> - So I figured it'd be all right.<br> - You think he'll ever find out about her?<br> He'd never come over here.<br> Here. You might as well look at this now.<br> It's a picture of your father<br> and your mother on their wedding day.<br> You're the first person<br> I've ever showed it to.<br> I knew it.<br> I knew it was true.<br> When that old guy told me in the bar,<br> I knew it.<br> How did you know it was true?<br> 'Cause she ain't no good<br> and I ain't no good.<br> I knew there was a reason why I wasn't.<br> I hate her.<br> And I hate him, too.<br> Come on, I'll take you home.<br> - You don't have to drive me home!<br> - I know I don't have to take you home!<br> Here.<br> A little bit of the hair<br> of the dog that bit you.<br> Come on now.<br> How did Dad meet her?<br> Where did she come from?<br> Nobody ever knew<br> where she come from, really.<br> There were a lot of drifters in those days.<br> Of all the people.<br> How come he married her?<br> You have no idea how pretty she was, Cal.<br> Young and full of spirit.<br> And your father hadn't been<br> off the ranch much, you know.<br> He's not a worldly man.<br> - Did she shoot him?<br> - Yes, she did.<br> How come?<br> I don't know.<br> Did he do something to her?<br> - Did he hurt her?<br> - No.<br> It wasn't in him to hurt her.<br> After she left him, he died.<br> He walked around, but he died.<br> He must have done something to hurt her.<br> No. No, sir.<br> He gave her everything<br> that any woman could ask for.<br> You see, your father has more kindness...<br> and more conscience<br> than any man that I've ever known.<br> He's a good man, Cal.<br> Don't sell him short, boy.<br> It's going to work.<br> If only I can keep them<br> cold enough long enough.<br> It's going to work.<br> All right, there she is. Let's try it.<br> Step back, girls.<br> All right, bring her on. Come on.<br> Now do you think it'll work?<br> - Good morning, Mr. Trask.<br> - Good morning.<br> Somebody swiped our coal chute<br> right off the wagon.<br> Dear, dear.<br> Times are getting pretty lawless.<br> It's this war in Europe.<br> There's a wave of lawlessness<br> spreading through the country.<br> Anyway, somebody swiped our chute.<br> - Is that where you're loading?<br> - Yes.<br> We'll move on, then. Good day, Mr. Trask.<br> It's this war in Europe.<br> Do you know where Aron is?<br> He's out in the fields. He's checking.<br> Can I do something for you?<br> No. There were just some matters<br> I want to talk over with him.<br> What have you got there?<br> I figured it would save some time. So I...<br> It's very ingenious, Cal. Very ingenious.<br> Did you think of it?<br> Yep.<br> I'm very pleased<br> with the way you're taking hold...<br> and are working so well, Cal.<br> Thanks. Thanks, Dad.<br> Think you better have your lunch now.<br> It's time.<br> Hi, Cal.<br> - Aron's out in the field.<br> - I brought his lunch.<br> - Okay, I'll take it to him.<br> - Cal.<br> Lydia, vamoose.<br> He'll be here in a minute.<br> I've been fixing Aron's lunch.<br> I'll fix yours, too, if you like, after this.<br> No, thanks.<br> Would you be eating with her<br> if I weren't here?<br> Who?<br> No, I didn't ask her to come up here.<br> Girls follow you around, don't they?<br> - Does she bother you?<br> - She doesn't bother me.<br> Who is she?<br> I never saw her before in my life.<br> I'll bet.<br> You're really working<br> at this lettuce business, aren't you, Cal?<br> Do you think it'll turn out all right?<br> Your father will lose quite a lot of money<br> if it doesn't.<br> Just about all he's got.<br> I like your father.<br> Do you?<br> I threw away about $3,000 once.<br> Yeah?<br> - When I was 13.<br> - You threw it away?<br> It was a diamond ring worth about that.<br> At least, my father told me<br> that's what he paid for it.<br> I threw it in the river.<br> Made Dad terribly angry.<br> I reckon it would.<br> But I forgave him.<br> And it's been all right ever since.<br> - You forgave him?<br> - Yes.<br> You forgave him 'cause you threw<br> a ring of his worth $3,000 into the river?<br> - That's right.<br> - And you forgave him?<br> That's right.<br> Is there an egg in this basket?<br> You see, I thought he didn't love me.<br> That made me feel awful.<br> Girls love their fathers terribly.<br> Do they?<br> My mother died when I was 13...<br> and Dad got married again soon after that.<br> Did you know that?<br> No, I didn't know that.<br> Are you interested in hearing about me?<br> Yeah.<br> When Dad got married again,<br> it made me sick.<br> I just hated everybody.<br> I used to sit and just glare at people...<br> or I wouldn't even answer<br> when they spoke to me.<br> - Why you telling me all this?<br> - I want to.<br> I was that way for months.<br> I just hated everybody.<br> I thought nobody in the world loved me.<br> And it was awful.<br> Then I found this ring<br> that Dad gave my new mother...<br> - so I took it and threw it in the river.<br> - Good.<br> I thought you'd like that.<br> - Did he ever find it?<br> - Never.<br> They tried.<br> What'd they do to you?<br> Dad punished me. Not badly, I guess.<br> But I felt<br> he shouldn't have punished me at all.<br> I felt he should have loved me more<br> because I did it.<br> But he didn't.<br> Isn't it funny?<br> I'm grown up now...<br> but I still understand kids better<br> than I do grownups.<br> You're not so grown- up.<br> - I'm very grown- up.<br> - That's a matter of opinion.<br> I'm very grown- up.<br> More so than Dad, because I forgave him<br> for not understanding.<br> And the minute I forgave him in my mind...<br> I felt better.<br> Now we get along fine.<br> We love each other.<br> Not like we did when I was 13...<br> but enough so we can live together<br> till I get married.<br> He's just my father now.<br> Nothing to rave about.<br> I still don't like her much,<br> but then, she's a woman.<br> My, that girl just hates me, doesn't she?<br> You better tell her I'm your brother's girl.<br> I don't have to explain anything<br> to anybody.<br> I'll go now and leave the field to her.<br> My, your hair's in a mess.<br> Dad, what's that?<br> That's something Cal rigged up.<br> It's a good idea.<br> Aron! I brought your lunch.<br> Looks like a coal chute.<br> Coal chute?<br> Okay, woman, where's the beans?<br> Cal!<br> What makes you think you have the right<br> to come and take something like this?<br> You probably lost those men their jobs.<br> Now, you take it back.<br> He's praising Cal and Cal is lapping it up.<br> Aron! Look, have one of those<br> made of wood.<br> - It'll save a lot of time.<br> - Yes, sir!<br> - Good waste of time and money.<br> - And lettuce.<br> - What'd you say?<br> - I said, it's a good idea if it works.<br> It's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta work.<br> It's gotta work, 'cause I said so.<br> If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault.<br> I never saw anybody work<br> so hard in my life.<br> Let's go, Pete. Now, Leonard!<br> Good luck, Adam.<br> Do you know the principle<br> of the internal combustion engine?<br> No, I'm afraid not.<br> Will, I'll never be able to...<br> Sure you will. You just listen to Roy.<br> He's been to the automobile school<br> in Chicago.<br> Mr. Trask has just revolutionized<br> the entire vegetable market.<br> - Wait till those cars get to New York.<br> - Don't you worry.<br> It's about time he owned<br> his own automobile...<br> and about time he learned to drive it.<br> - Now don't you think so, Roy?<br> - I'll do my best.<br> Now pay strict attention, boys.<br> Don't touch that!<br> Wait till it's explained to you.<br> No, now for heaven's sake,<br> don't touch anything, anybody.<br> The power of the explosion<br> is exerted on a piston...<br> and through connecting rod<br> and crankshaft...<br> through transmission,<br> thence to rear wheels.<br> - Got that so far?<br> - Sure, he's got that.<br> Now, we go on<br> to the operation of the automobile.<br> This here's the ignition key.<br> Would you mind putting out<br> that cigarette, please.<br> Turn this doohickey here to the left.<br> That puts her on battery.<br> - See where it says "bat"?<br> - Yes.<br> - Bat, short for battery.<br> - That's right. Good boy.<br> Thank you. Thank you very much.<br> First you gotta retard the spark.<br> If you don't retard the spark,<br> she'll probably kick your blasted arm off.<br> Now remember that.<br> This here is the spark.<br> You push her way up. Listen.<br> - This here's the gas. You push her...<br> - Down.<br> - You had lessons before.<br> - No, I just saw you do it.<br> - You're a pretty smart old buzzard.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - Keep your eyes open, don't you?<br> - Try to.<br> Now, this here is the crank.<br> See this wire sticking out of the radiator?<br> That's the choke.<br> Now watch careful.<br> Grab hold of the crank like this.<br> Push in till she catches.<br> See how my thumb is turned down?<br> I noticed that. Why do you do that?<br> If you put her around this way<br> with my thumb around her...<br> she'd probably knock<br> my blasted thumb off.<br> Dear, dear. First you lose your blasted arm<br> and then you lose your blasted thumb.<br> - That's kind of wrong way around.<br> - How's that?<br> He made a joke.<br> I never did see him so happy.<br> You pull out this choke<br> turn her around to suck gas in.<br> Then you give her a hard spin.<br> - She caught, first time!<br> - Caught on what?<br> Advance the spark and retard the gas.<br> Reach over real quick and switch<br> to mag. That's magneto.<br> So, there you are.<br> Isn't that wonderful?<br> Of course, it isn't exactly<br> going anywhere, is it?<br> That's the easy part.<br> - Adam.<br> - I want you all to repeat after me.<br> Spark up, gas down.<br> Switch to bat.<br> Crank to compression, thumb down.<br> You get that? Let's have it again.<br> Spark up, gas down.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Big snow slide.<br> Closed the pass and stopped the cars<br> about 100 miles out.<br> Can see water running out of the cars.<br> It's still a good idea.<br> Cold can preserve things.<br> Someday, somebody'll prove it.<br> - It was your idea.<br> - No!<br> It was presumptuous of me<br> to think it would be I.<br> Guess we bit off more lettuce<br> than we could chew.<br> What do you know about that?<br> I thought he'd really be hurt.<br> You don't understand him.<br> - You can't go in there.<br> - I gotta see Will Hamilton.<br> He won't be through for an hour.<br> They just started.<br> - Let me see him.<br> - There's a war in Europe.<br> These boys are trying<br> to get themselves in shape. So beat it.<br> Right, left.<br> Now, deep knee bends, follow me.<br> - What's that?<br> - That's the fire bell.<br> We better have a look.<br> - It may be the Germans.<br> - Fire, Germans, who cares? I surrender.<br> - Howdy, Mr. Albrecht.<br> - Hello, Cal.<br> - Mr. Hamilton.<br> - There's a fire somewhere.<br> - No. I rang the bell.<br> - You rang it?<br> Yeah. I had to see you.<br> You know, you're crazy.<br> You're really crazy.<br> I knew it when you pushed that ice<br> down the chute.<br> Let's get out of here<br> before they start up that piano again.<br> There must be some easier way<br> to stop the Germans than this, anyway.<br> - You see, I gotta make some money.<br> - Sure, everybody's got to.<br> Remember, you said that<br> if you wanna make money...<br> you ought to raise beans?<br> Yeah, beans are up 3.5 cents now.<br> Now, the way I figure it, it's like you said.<br> The country's gonna get into war, isn't it?<br> I don't see any way out.<br> - War's good for business.<br> - The best there is.<br> See, that's why I wanna go into beans.<br> See, I gotta get enough money<br> to give my father back what he lost.<br> I see.<br> You think you can make<br> all that money back?<br> I gotta.<br> You know, you're crazy.<br> Look, Cal, don't you know...<br> that you gotta have money<br> in order to make money?<br> - I'll get some money.<br> - How?<br> I'll get it.<br> Look, don't get so near to me.<br> I don't wanna get all hot again.<br> - How much money could you get?<br> - What do you think I need?<br> If you had $5,000...<br> $5,000?<br> It's a little different when you start<br> putting it into figures, isn't it?<br> I know you wanna help your father...<br> but a kid your age can't be expected<br> to put his hands on $5,000.<br> Maybe if you could raise $100 or so,<br> we could let you have a little share.<br> I don't want a little share,<br> I want the whole thing.<br> - I'll get $5,000.<br> - Maybe if you and Aron went in together...<br> Aron ain't got nothing to do with this.<br> This is my deal.<br> I'll get the $5,000.<br> What're you gonna do, borrow it?<br> Yeah.<br> All right. If you can borrow $5,000...<br> I know a farmer who's got over 800 acres.<br> - It's under cultivation.<br> - All right. What do we do?<br> If we can guarantee him 5 cents a pound...<br> and make him a seed loan,<br> he'll plant beans.<br> So will a lot of other farmers.<br> Why, we can contract<br> all the bean acreage you want.<br> That's it. That's great. When do we start?<br> How do you know the price<br> will go above 5, though?<br> Did you read the newspapers<br> this morning?<br> We're apt to be in war any minute.<br> You know I got a contract<br> with the British Purchasing Agency...<br> and I got a friend in<br> the Quartermaster Corps.<br> Do you know<br> that we could sell all the dry beans...<br> that we can find<br> at 10 cents a pound or more?<br> That's what I want. That's it. See?<br> - How much will I make?<br> - Enough for what you want.<br> - What does Cal stand for?<br> - Caleb.<br> It's in the Bible.<br> - What's your brother's name?<br> - Aron.<br> That's in the Bible, too.<br> What's he like?<br> He looks like you.<br> Is he like me?<br> No. He's good.<br> I'm more like you.<br> How's Adam?<br> How's your father?<br> I don't wanna talk about him.<br> - You don't?<br> - No.<br> I didn't know who you were<br> when you were here before.<br> I knew you didn't.<br> Aren't you afraid<br> to come around here again?<br> Yeah, I am. No. Well, kind of.<br> What do you want?<br> Just to look at me?<br> I want $5,000.<br> All right, come on in. Sit down.<br> Come in.<br> Try that chair.<br> You got your father's eyes.<br> That's all I can see of him.<br> - You're a nice looking boy.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - I was very beautiful once.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Caleb and Aron.<br> Your father still thinks<br> he's living in the Bible, huh?<br> Them's just names.<br> Joe says that you go to school in Salinas.<br> Are you good in your studies?<br> I get by with them.<br> Does Aron get by with them?<br> He's bright.<br> What are you gonna do when you finish?<br> You're going to college?<br> Maybe.<br> Or back to some ranch?<br> No, I don't like the ranch.<br> You take after me.<br> Makes me mad just to think about a ranch.<br> Sit down.<br> Thanks.<br> What do you want with $5,000?<br> I want to go into business.<br> - You're a little young for that, aren't you?<br> - I'm old enough.<br> Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess you are.<br> - What business do you wanna go into?<br> - Beans.<br> Beans are up to 3.5 cents now.<br> And if we get into war,<br> they're gonna go up to 10, 12.<br> - Lf we get into the war.<br> - That's a gamble you have to take.<br> - Will Hamilton says that...<br> - Will?<br> You going into business<br> with Will Hamilton?<br> You see...<br> my father, he lost about all he had in...<br> Yeah, I know. I heard about that.<br> I wanna make enough to pay him back.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> Can't he make any money?<br> Yeah.<br> Only...<br> Only he's too good to bother with money.<br> Okay.<br> What makes you think I'd give you $5,000?<br> I don't know who else to ask.<br> You got a lot of nerve coming to me.<br> Why? I didn't do anything to you.<br> It's a good business venture.<br> I'll pay you back. I'll give you interest.<br> You're a business woman, ain't you?<br> One of the best, Son.<br> You know, Sam told me that you think<br> I ought to be run out of town.<br> You're afraid that your father and Aron<br> might find out about me, is that it?<br> This $5,000, now.<br> That wouldn't be<br> any kind of blackmail, would it?<br> I never thought about that.<br> But now that you do, it's a good idea, huh?<br> - I guess, maybe.<br> - It's not.<br> Anyway, I'm not gonna hurt<br> your precious father or your brother.<br> - Do they know anything about me?<br> - No.<br> Father thinks you're in the East...<br> and Aron thinks you're dead.<br> Then, there's no reason to think<br> that they ever will find out about me.<br> We don't exactly move in the same circles.<br> What are you staring at?<br> How come you did it?<br> Did what?<br> Shot my father?<br> Did he tell you that?<br> How come you ran away from all of us?<br> How come you shot him?<br> - Ran away and did all that kind of stuff?<br> - None of your business.<br> I shot him because he tried to stop me.<br> I could have killed him if I'd wanted to,<br> but I didn't.<br> I just wanted him to let me go.<br> - Why?<br> - Because he tried to hold me.<br> He wanted to tie me down.<br> He wanted to keep me<br> on a stinking little ranch...<br> away from everybody.<br> Keep me all to himself.<br> Nobody holds me.<br> - But he loved you.<br> - Love.<br> He wanted to own me.<br> He wanted to bring me up<br> like a snot-nosed kid...<br> and tell me what to do.<br> Nobody tells me what to do.<br> Always so right himself.<br> Knowing everything.<br> Reading the Bible at me.<br> - What are you grinning at?<br> - Nothing.<br> Maybe you know what I'm talking about?<br> Always so right himself?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> Maybe like you said out there,<br> maybe you are more like me.<br> Yeah, you got sense.<br> Maybe you don't fall for that slop<br> any more than I do.<br> Maybe you know what people<br> are really like. What they want.<br> I got the toughest house on the coast...<br> and the finest clientele.<br> Half the stinking city hall go there.<br> They sneak in at night...<br> and I walk in this front door<br> in the daytime, see.<br> And I built it up from nothing.<br> Now you want $5,000 of my money...<br> to go into business<br> to pay your father back what he lost.<br> You know, that's funny.<br> I don't think he'll know where I got it.<br> No, but it's funny just the same.<br> Your father.<br> He's the purest man there is, isn't he?<br> He thought he had me all tied up<br> with his purity.<br> And now I give you $5,000<br> of the money that I made...<br> to save him his purity.<br> If you don't think that's funny,<br> you'd better not go to college.<br> Okay.<br> Tell Will Hamilton to come and see me.<br> He's a good businessman.<br> How'd he ever happen to let you go<br> into this bean business, anyway?<br> I don't know.<br> I do. Maybe he likes you.<br> Maybe.<br> You're a likeable kid.<br> You give this to him.<br> If he wants to gamble<br> that we get into the war...<br> it's okay with me.<br> You're a likeable kid.<br> Go on, get out of here.<br> Go on, get out. I'm running a business.<br> - Them Germans can't fight.<br> - No.<br> Hi, partner.<br> Every day in every way,<br> we're getting richer and richer.<br> Kaiser.<br> All we have to do is call his bluff.<br> He'll come to heel like a dog.<br> We'll be there to clean up this mess<br> for those foreigners in a couple of weeks.<br> Cal, stop it.<br> There's Cal.<br> - Hi, boy. Hey, want some?<br> - Hello, Cal.<br> Thanks.<br> Your own Woodrow Wilson said you gotta<br> make the country safe for democracy.<br> - Didn't he say that?<br> - Yes, he said that.<br> Will you go?<br> I think the war will be over. I don't think...<br> If you believe in all this, why don't you?<br> If you really think it's right.<br> I didn't say it was right, Aron.<br> No, I guess you didn't.<br> Why don't you go back<br> and join the parade?<br> Nothing'll ever make me go. Nothing.<br> I just don't believe it's right.<br> - Did you water them good?<br> - Sure, lots of water.<br> - Not too much, though.<br> - No, just right.<br> Marty Hopps got a telegram today.<br> His boy was killed.<br> I remember the day we sent him off.<br> A lot of troop ships have sunk<br> they don't tell us about.<br> - It's gonna be a long war.<br> - Those Germans got an army.<br> They're a military nation.<br> Go back where you came from, German!<br> Go on home, German!<br> This is just the start.<br> That rock through the window<br> is just the beginning.<br> The German people don't want this war.<br> And the stories they tell<br> of what the Germans are doing...<br> it simply is not true. Not the good ones.<br> I've been wondering lately<br> if we shouldn't all go back to the ranch.<br> You can't get away from it there, Dad.<br> I don't know, somehow, on a ranch,<br> I don't know...<br> War seems to be<br> city people's business somehow.<br> Farmers. What's a farmer got to do<br> with war?<br> You tired, Dad?<br> My eyes, I guess.<br> I work too hard at the Draft Board.<br> Better have my glasses looked at,<br> see if they're all right.<br> I had a look at the bank account<br> the other day...<br> not much left after my great fiasco.<br> Let's not worry about money, Dad.<br> Let's not worry about money, Dad.<br> Let's don't worry about money.<br> Hey, Rantani!<br> Ain't this some sight?<br> Beans!<br> Yeah, boy, some beans.<br> You come here everyday, boy,<br> what do you think...<br> you gonna make them grow quicker?<br> He's crazy.<br> Hey, where have you been?<br> Come on.<br> We're gonna have lots of fun tonight.<br> - You won another cigar.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> You wanna try one? No?<br> Pick up my cigar.<br> - I'm waiting for somebody.<br> - You're waiting for me.<br> No, I'm not.<br> Why don't you let me<br> take you for a nice ride?<br> If you don't stop bothering me,<br> I'll have to call someone.<br> - Hello, Cal.<br> - What's the matter?<br> I was trying to tell this gentleman<br> that I was waiting for somebody.<br> This is a lousy place<br> to keep your girlfriend waiting for you.<br> - Sir, it won't happen again.<br> - I hope not.<br> Lots of lousy characters around here.<br> Sorry, miss.<br> Here I am, lady.<br> That's the first time<br> that ever happened to me.<br> - What're you doing out here?<br> - I'm meeting Aron.<br> I thought I'd come out early<br> and look around.<br> - You never been out here before?<br> - Not at night, no.<br> - What time you gonna meet him?<br> - At 8:00.<br> Thought I'd try and cheer him up.<br> He's been so depressed lately.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> I'm so glad you happened to be here.<br> You got a half hour?<br> How are you, Cal?<br> We never see you around anymore.<br> I'm around.<br> I've been over to the house several times,<br> but you were never there.<br> - I never go home anymore.<br> - Aron says he hardly ever sees you.<br> I feel awfully sorry for him.<br> You're terrible.<br> That's the first time<br> that ever happened to me, too.<br> Wonder if we can see Aron from here.<br> I feel awfully sorry for him.<br> He's right, you know.<br> I mean, it's awful, the war and people<br> killing each other.<br> Why feel sorry for Aron?<br> Feel sorry for the people.<br> But it just seems to affect him<br> so personally.<br> I'll agree with that.<br> He's right.<br> He's always right.<br> And he has always been right.<br> Now let's talk about something else.<br> All right.<br> We got a lot to see.<br> Will we be back in time for Aron?<br> All right. I'd love to.<br> Easy.<br> Here's your cigar,<br> and where have you been hiding?<br> - Who was that?<br> - Who?<br> - That girl.<br> - I don't see nobody.<br> She was standing right...<br> Girls follow you around, don't they?<br> What are girls like that like?<br> All right, never mind.<br> These Huns have been the aggressors<br> in every war in Europe...<br> since the time of Julius Caesar.<br> I couldn't attempt to describe to you<br> the horrors committed by the Germans.<br> Look.<br> Would we have time?<br> ...after the Germans had been through...<br> - the women of the town...<br> - That German's here again.<br> It is not true. It is lies, all lies.<br> Come on, Cal. Is it scary?<br> Here we go.<br> It is lies, all lies.<br> I'd like to give that guy<br> a piece of my mind.<br> See over there. That's Castroville.<br> Everything looks so small down there.<br> Higher and higher and higher and higher<br> What?<br> Growing and growing<br> and growing and growing<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - I'll tell you sometime.<br> Does Aron really love me?<br> I seem to have sort of lost him.<br> I mean, we're going<br> to be married someday, but...<br> Well, if he does love me, he doesn't...<br> I can't tell anymore.<br> Cal, can I ask you something?<br> Yeah, go ahead.<br> These girls that you always<br> go around with.<br> You know, remember there was<br> that little Mexican girl once.<br> What are girls like that like?<br> You don't really love them, do you?<br> Why do you go out with them?<br> Is it because you're bad?<br> You're not angry, are you?<br> - Well, why do you, then? Are you bad?<br> - Do you think I'm bad?<br> I don't know.<br> I guess I don't know<br> what is good and what's bad.<br> I mean, Aron is so good...<br> and I'm not.<br> Not good enough for Aron, anyway.<br> Because sometimes when I'm with Aron...<br> Aron likes to talk about our being in love...<br> and think about it<br> and that's all right, but...<br> These girls that you go out with, do you...<br> Maybe I don't know what love is, exactly.<br> I know love is good the way Aron says...<br> but it's more than that, it's got to be.<br> I shouldn't talk to you this way...<br> but I don't know who else to talk to.<br> Sometimes I think I'm really bad.<br> Sometimes I don't know what to think.<br> - Aron'll knock that out of you.<br> - Will he?<br> He's got to.<br> The way I figure it out...<br> Aron never having had a mother...<br> he's made her everything good<br> that he can think of...<br> and that's what he thinks I am.<br> That's who he's in love with.<br> It's not me at all.<br> 'Cause I'm not a bit like that made- up one.<br> Not a bit.<br> I don't mean I think I'm really bad.<br> Look at that star.<br> It must be a planet, it's so bright.<br> Probably.<br> I bet that girl's waiting for you<br> down there somewhere.<br> She can just wait.<br> She was pretty.<br> You've been awfully nice, Cal,<br> taking care of me.<br> I love Aron. I do, really I do.<br> I do.<br> To give these fiends a lesson that...<br> Have you seen Abra, Mr. Albrecht?<br> Lies. All lies.<br> What's the matter with you tonight, Gus?<br> Gus, come on.<br> There's Aron.<br> You're a good shoemaker.<br> There's Aron, down there.<br> Major, why don't you stay out of politics?<br> Mr. Albrecht.<br> They're pushing him around.<br> What are they doing?<br> That'd kill Dad if he knew that.<br> Hey, operator,<br> when does this thing move again.<br> Hey!<br> Cal, don't!<br> Watch yourself, get back!<br> Please. Somebody pull him back.<br> Don't bother me!<br> Come on.<br> - Gus, come on, have a drink.<br> - No, Charlie, no drink.<br> What are you waiting for?<br> Mr. Albrecht, calm down.<br> They're not bad fellows.<br> Aron, you are a child.<br> All I tried to do was buy him a drink.<br> Gustav.<br> Silence.<br> You all loved him a few weeks ago,<br> what's gotten into you?<br> I'm sick of him sticking up<br> for the Germans.<br> - You a friend of the Germans?<br> - I'm a friend of this German.<br> There are rose plants in that border there.<br> Please be careful where you step.<br> We liked him. He made us laugh<br> because of his funny German accent.<br> Let him read this<br> in his funny German accent.<br> - What is it?<br> - Let him come down and read it.<br> - He doesn't have to read anything.<br> - I will read it.<br> Here, give it to me.<br> "The Government, with deep regret,<br> informs...<br> "that your son was killed in action,<br> "He died a hero and an American."<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopps. I did not...<br> You're not sorry enough.<br> - I don't think he's sorry.<br> - He's not sorry at all.<br> - Listen, why don't we all go on home...<br> - You're not sorry enough.<br> Why aren't you in the war?<br> This will make you sorry.<br> Hello, Charlie.<br> Danny, what are you fellows<br> doing here, anyway?<br> Get up.<br> Loretta, I didn't expect to find you here.<br> Evening, Rose.<br> Looks like they messed up<br> your rose garden a little here, Gus.<br> Somebody owes you an apology.<br> How about you folks all going home now?<br> I think this'll do for tonight.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.<br> - May I?<br> - Come in.<br> This place will be fixed up<br> just like it was before.<br> - I'm gonna see to it.<br> - Ja. He will see to it.<br> Where were you?<br> Where did you get his coat?<br> You all right?<br> You had to start slugging, didn't you?<br> Were you showing off for her?<br> You had to start slugging.<br> - I was trying to help you.<br> - I don't need your help.<br> If you want to slug people,<br> do it for yourself and not for me.<br> - And don't lie to me about trying to...<br> - Aron, I tried to help you!<br> - Great big Aron.<br> - You finished?<br> - No!<br> - Cal, stop it! Don't.<br> - Don't.<br> - Don't do that.<br> - Don't.<br> - Abra, don't do that!<br> Wait here.<br> I was trying to help him.<br> Who am I kidding?<br> I tried to kill him.<br> Mike, give me a drink.<br> - Don't drink any more.<br> - Why?<br> - No, please. It's not good for you.<br> - It's good for me.<br> - No, you're gonna get drunk.<br> - Yeah, I'm gonna get drunk.<br> Please forget it, what happened up<br> on the ferris wheel.<br> It didn't mean anything, really.<br> Please, forget it. It didn't mean anything.<br> Say it didn't. Please, say it didn't.<br> Someday he's gonna know<br> who his real son is.<br> What?<br> Someday he's gonna know.<br> I don't understand you. You scare me.<br> - I know. I scare myself.<br> - Abra.<br> Fix me another drink.<br> - I want that money. Now you give it to me.<br> - You know I haven't any money here.<br> Okay.<br> - When will you get it?<br> - In the morning, I suppose.<br> Okay. I'll sleep here.<br> Come on. You've gotta go home.<br> If you still feel the same way<br> in the morning...<br> you come back, we'll go to the bank...<br> and I'll see that you get everything<br> that's coming to you.<br> I'll buy out your share.<br> I'll go on and make a fortune with it.<br> Okay. That seems fair to me, Will.<br> Abra.<br> What?<br> - Who is it?<br> - Cal.<br> - Cal?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What on earth are you doing here?<br> - I want to see you.<br> Wait till I put something on.<br> I gotta tell you something.<br> Can you keep a secret?<br> Yes. What is it?<br> What's the matter? You look terrible.<br> - I got it.<br> - What?<br> Remember that money? Dad lost?<br> On that lettuce business?<br> - I got it.<br> - You mean you earned it all back?<br> - I've earned every cent.<br> - That's wonderful, Cal.<br> You got any time off tomorrow<br> from the hospital?<br> I get an hour at lunchtime. Why?<br> Thursday's Dad's birthday.<br> And I'm gonna give a party for him.<br> And I want you and me,<br> you and Aron and me...<br> to be there.<br> I'm gonna give him that money<br> just like it was a birthday present.<br> You could come<br> and help me get some junk...<br> - and we could decorate the house.<br> - Sure.<br> And we'll get balloons...<br> - and all that kid stuff, birthday stuff.<br> - We can go to the five and 10.<br> - Will you do it?<br> - I'd like to.<br> I'm sort of...<br> Why did I hit Aron?<br> Why did I hit him so hard?<br> Will you help me?<br> Will you really help me?<br> I'll help you, Cal.<br> Be careful.<br> How'd I get up here?<br> - Is your father coming?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Cal, don't get nervous.<br> - I think it looks beautiful.<br> Don't you? I love the way it looks.<br> - It looks festive, doesn't it?<br> - Yes, it does.<br> Yes, Cal, it looks very pretty.<br> - Do you think this is childish?<br> - Not a bit.<br> The room looks lovely.<br> Your father's going to love it.<br> - How's the turkey?<br> - It's a good turkey.<br> - Smells ready.<br> - It'll be ready.<br> - Aron didn't get him anything?<br> - He told me he had something.<br> - What?<br> - He didn't tell me what it was.<br> - It won't stack up against mine, will it?<br> - No.<br> - Do you wanna see mine?<br> - I'd like to.<br> - I got it wrapped up.<br> - Show it to me.<br> - Wanna see it?<br> - Yes.<br> Okay.<br> - You like it?<br> - It's pretty.<br> You think it's pretty?<br> Don't drink any more wine.<br> - Did Aron tell you what the present was?<br> - No.<br> - You sure?<br> - Honestly, he didn't.<br> I'd tell you if he did. Honestly, I would.<br> Now everything's gonna go off fine. Here.<br> The brooms.<br> - Don't you do anything to give me away.<br> - I wouldn't.<br> We'll let him come in<br> and let the house speak for itself.<br> - We'll act like it was any other old day.<br> - Yes. Wait, Cal.<br> Cal.<br> You look wonderful.<br> Thanks.<br> But I need my son.<br> It isn't that he doesn't want<br> to fight for his country. He does.<br> I need him to work the farm.<br> Things can't be as bad as you say,<br> Mr. Piscora.<br> You must be making plenty of money<br> out of your crops.<br> No money. I sold this year's crop<br> for 5 cents before I even planted it.<br> Everything cost so much now.<br> And now I got to sell next year crop.<br> So I need my boy.<br> I can do nothing about it, Mr. Piscora.<br> In all conscience,<br> I cannot excuse your son.<br> - Come on, Poppa.<br> - I don't like it.<br> I'm telling you. I don't like it.<br> Hello, Abra. Nice to see you.<br> - Gonna stay to dinner?<br> - Yes, I am. Is something the matter?<br> No, nothing. I guess I shouldn't<br> have taken that job in the Draft Board.<br> - Did you notice the snow on Mount Toro?<br> - Yes, I saw it.<br> Say, that means we got<br> a good year coming in.<br> - We could use it.<br> - Let's go in.<br> - Happy birthday, Dad.<br> - Happy birthday, Mr. Trask.<br> Is it possible? I'm very touched.<br> - Are you surprised?<br> - I had no idea. I'd forgotten completely.<br> - We knew you had, didn't we?<br> - Completely. I don't know what to say.<br> We got turkey.<br> - And champagne.<br> - Champagne, and we got all the things.<br> - We got the trimmings here.<br> - Isn't that pretty?<br> Got something for you.<br> Presents, too. Isn't that nice. Look.<br> - Ain't you gonna open it up?<br> - Yes.<br> Dad, Abra and I have one for you, too,<br> only we can't exactly give it to you.<br> I didn't tell Abra I was going to do this,<br> but we're engaged.<br> I couldn't have wished for anything nicer.<br> A lovely birthday present.<br> - You have my blessings.<br> - Thank you, Dad.<br> - But you haven't opened Cal's present yet.<br> - No.<br> But I can't imagine having<br> anything better than this.<br> Excuse me.<br> 'Course I suspected it right along.<br> But, Cal, coming on my birthday.<br> What's this?<br> What is this?<br> I made it. And it's for you.<br> It's all the money you lost on the lettuce.<br> You made it? But how?<br> Go on.<br> - Beans.<br> - Beans?<br> Yes, we bought futures at 5 cents...<br> and the war came along<br> and the price went sky-high.<br> So, that's for you.<br> It's all the money you lost<br> in the lettuce business.<br> It's for you.<br> - I made it for you.<br> - You will have to give it back.<br> No, I made it for you, Dad.<br> I want you to have it.<br> - You will have to give it back.<br> - Who? I can't give it...<br> - To the people you got it from.<br> - No, the British Purchasing Agency?<br> - I can't give it back.<br> - Give it to the farmers you robbed.<br> We didn't rob anybody, Dad.<br> We paid 2 cents a pound,<br> I sign my name<br> and boys go out and some die...<br> and some live helpless<br> without arms and legs.<br> Not one will come back untorn.<br> Do you think I could take<br> a profit from that?<br> I don't want the money, Cal!<br> I couldn't take it!<br> - I thank you for the thought, but...<br> - I'll keep it for you.<br> I'll wrap it up<br> and we'll just keep it in here...<br> I'll never take it!<br> Son, I'd be happy if you'd give me...<br> something like your brother's given me.<br> Something honest and human and good.<br> Don't be angry, Son.<br> If you want to give me a present,<br> give me a good life.<br> That's something I could value.<br> I hate you!<br> What are you doing?<br> He doesn't want anything from me.<br> Cal, don't.<br> Please, don't.<br> Abra!<br> Don't you ever touch her again.<br> I don't trust you.<br> You're no good.<br> You're mean and vicious and wild.<br> And you always have been.<br> You know it, too, don't you?<br> Father and I have put up<br> with every vicious thing...<br> you could think of since you were a child.<br> And we've always forgiven you.<br> But now I don't want you to go near Abra.<br> I don't want you to talk with her.<br> Just stay away from her!<br> - You want to go some place with me?<br> - Why should I?<br> I got something to show you.<br> - Think you'll find it very interesting.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> Maybe our mother didn't die<br> and go to heaven after all, Aron.<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> - Maybe she didn't.<br> Maybe she's alive someplace.<br> What are you up to now?<br> Remember when we were kids,<br> we used to make up stories about her?<br> You said she must have looked<br> like heaven's youngest angel, remember?<br> Remember that time I shot that rabbit?<br> You cried and you said...<br> that she would have cried, too,<br> 'cause she was so tenderhearted.<br> And you said I was bad,<br> you remember that?<br> I just want to show you something.<br> It's not gonna take very long.<br> What's the matter, you afraid?<br> I'm not afraid to look at anything<br> you could show me.<br> Can you look at the truth, just once?<br> Come on, you can look<br> at the truth just once. Can't you?<br> Come on.<br> I want to show you something.<br> It won't take very long.<br> Oh, Cal.<br> Hello.<br> Mother, this is your other son, Aron.<br> Aron is everything that's good, Mother.<br> Say hello to your mother.<br> Say hello to your mother, Aron!<br> Joe!<br> - Play another song!<br> - Quiet!<br> Five!<br> "I'm thinking of the lilac trees<br> that shook their purple plumes<br> "I'm thinking of the rivulet<br> with its cool and silvery flow<br> "Of the old gray rock that shadowed it<br> and the peppermint below"<br> - Where is Aron?<br> - I don't know. I'm not my brother's keeper.<br> - Where did you go?<br> - For a ride.<br> - What did you quarrel about?<br> - You.<br> - You're angry about the money.<br> - No, I'm not angry.<br> I like it. I think it's great.<br> I'm gonna go away<br> and take that money with me.<br> I think I'll start me a little business.<br> Just like my mother did.<br> - What do you know about your mother?<br> - I know where she is and what she is.<br> And I know why she left you.<br> Couldn't stand it.<br> You didn't really love her<br> any more than you do me.<br> Because of your goodness, your rightness.<br> You never gave either one of us<br> an inch, ever...<br> from what you thought was right.<br> You kept on forgiving us,<br> but you never really loved us.<br> I know why you didn't love me.<br> Because I'm like my mother...<br> and you never forgave yourself<br> for having loved her.<br> I'm not gonna forgive him.<br> I'm never gonna forgive him.<br> - Where is Aron?<br> - He's with her, with his mother.<br> She's over there in Monterey,<br> if you want to know.<br> She owns one of them houses.<br> I took Aron there tonight<br> because I was jealous.<br> I've been jealous all my life.<br> Jealous, I couldn't even stand it.<br> Tonight, I even tried to buy your love.<br> But now I don't want it anymore.<br> - I can't use it anymore.<br> - Don't talk to your father like that.<br> I don't want any kind of love anymore.<br> It doesn't pay off.<br> No future in it.<br> Let him go if he wants to.<br> No, I won't.<br> You hate me, too, don't you?<br> I'm afraid of you.<br> What you did to Aron tonight,<br> I don't know what it will do to him.<br> I feel like I'm to blame, too.<br> - Adam!<br> - Here. What is it?<br> ...drunk and had a couple of fights.<br> He's gone kind of crazy.<br> He's at the station now.<br> Wait, I'll drive you down in my car.<br> Cal!<br> - What happened between you and Aron?<br> - Why?<br> He's gone kind of crazy.<br> He's drunk and had a couple of fights...<br> and seemed determined<br> to get himself hurt.<br> He's leaving on that troop train tonight...<br> and says he's gonna enlist tomorrow<br> at King City.<br> Adam's on his way down there now<br> to talk to him before the train leaves.<br> I think you better get down there.<br> - Yeah.<br> - My car's downstairs.<br> Do you know what a stroke is, exactly?<br> This one is a leakage of blood in the brain<br> caused by shock.<br> There have been earlier, smaller leakages.<br> The left side is paralyzed,<br> and the right side partly.<br> In other words,<br> your father is nearly helpless.<br> - Will he die?<br> - He might live a week or a year.<br> He might die tonight.<br> - Will he know me?<br> - You'll have to find that out for yourself.<br> Good day.<br> Good day, Doctor. Good day, Sam.<br> "Cain rose up against his brother Abel,<br> and slew him.<br> "And Cain went away and dwelt<br> in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden."<br> Now why don't you go away some place?<br> - He's right.<br> - No.<br> Yes, he is. He's right. That's what I'll do.<br> Who's gonna wash these things for me?<br> Thank you.<br> - There you are.<br> - How is he?<br> He's fine. He's my darling.<br> Washed his face, combed his hair.<br> Can I go in there now?<br> Just for a minute. I want him to rest.<br> Gotta get lots of sleep.<br> - How is he, really?<br> - Haven't I seen you at the hospital?<br> - Not part of the family, are you?<br> - No.<br> I didn't think so.<br> I can tell you,<br> I won't have this job for long.<br> That's my luck. Always seem to get them<br> when they're old and ready to die off.<br> Now doesn't he look nice?<br> He's going to be a darling patient.<br> Even tried to smile at me,<br> didn't you, my dear?<br> - I don't want you to tire my patient.<br> - Please go.<br> Now listen, miss,<br> don't you try to order me about.<br> I'll report you to the doctor.<br> Will you go out of the room<br> and shut the door?<br> Father.<br> Can you hear me?<br> I did an awful thing.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Mr. Trask, can you hear me?<br> Is it just Cal you won't answer?<br> Can you answer?<br> I think you can understand me, though.<br> I think behind your eyes<br> you're just as alert as ever.<br> You understand everything I say<br> only you can't show it.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Trask,<br> for daring to speak to you this way...<br> but it's awful not to be loved.<br> It's the worst thing in the world.<br> Don't ask me how I know that.<br> I just know it.<br> It makes you mean and violent and cruel.<br> And that's the way<br> Cal has always felt, all his life.<br> I know you didn't mean it to be that way,<br> but it's true.<br> You never gave him your love.<br> You never asked him for his.<br> You never asked him for one thing.<br> Cal is going away, Mr. Trask.<br> But before he goes...<br> He did something very bad,<br> and I'm not asking you to forgive him.<br> You have to give him some sign<br> that you love him...<br> or else he'll never be a man.<br> He'll just keep on feeling guilty<br> and alone, unless you release him.<br> Please, help him.<br> I love Cal, Mr. Trask,<br> and I want him to be whole and strong...<br> and you're the only one who can do it.<br> So try, please try.<br> If you could ask him for something.<br> Let him help you so that he knows<br> that you love him.<br> Let him do for you.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Trask, for daring<br> to speak to you this way, but I just had to.<br> You've tired my patient...<br> and I most certainly shall report it<br> to the doctor in the morning.<br> You don't know that he accuses you.<br> You don't know what he's thinking about.<br> Stop it, Cal.<br> You gonna cry for the rest of your life?<br> - No.<br> - Then stop it.<br> Go in there and talk to him<br> before it's too late.<br> - I can't.<br> - Please try.<br> Get it straight.<br> Get through to him, somehow.<br> Please try, Cal, before it's too late.<br> - Is there any coffee around here?<br> - I'll get you some in a minute.<br> Try.<br> Is there anything to read around here?<br> What would you like?<br> - Something to get my mind off my feet.<br> - There's something in there.<br> I tried to believe it was born in me...<br> and that I couldn't help it,<br> but that's not so.<br> A man has a choice.<br> You used to say that was where<br> he was different from an animal.<br> You see, I remember.<br> A man has a choice,<br> and the choice is what makes him a man.<br> You see, I do remember.<br> - Look, I can't find any coffee.<br> - Get out!<br> Look.<br> Do something...<br> for me.<br> Yes.<br> That woman...<br> the nurse, can't stand her.<br> Get me another.<br> I can't stand her, either.<br> What did he say?<br> He said, "Don't get anybody else."<br> He said, "You stay with me...<br> "and you take care of me."<br> English<br>
