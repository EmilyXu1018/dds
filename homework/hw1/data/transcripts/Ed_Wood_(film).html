                        Greetings, my friend.<br> You are interested<br> in the unknown...<br> the mysterious,<br> the unexplainable.<br> That is why you are here.<br> And now,<br> for the first time...<br> we are bringing you<br> the full story of what happened.<br> We are giving you all<br> the evidence, based only...<br> on the secret testimony<br> of the miserable souls...<br> who survived<br> this terrifying ordeal.<br> The incidents, places--<br> My friend, we cannot keep this<br> a secret any longer.<br> Can your heart stand<br> the shocking facts...<br> of the true story<br> of Edward D. Wood,Jr.?<br> It`s 8:1 5. We can`t hold<br> the curtain any longer.<br> Cripes, what am I gonna tell the cast?<br> It`s press night and there`s no press.<br> - Do you believe in ghosts?<br> - Nah, Tommy.<br> That`s just kiddie<br> spook stories.<br> Once you`re dead,<br> you stay dead.<br> I don`t know, Bill.<br> Out on that battlefield today...<br> I saw this woman in-- dressed in<br> white, floating above the dunes.<br> Or maybe it was<br> just fatigue or...<br> maybe it`s<br> the indignities of war.<br> Or maybe<br> it`s somethin` else.<br> Hey, I think<br> I see somethin`.<br> I offer you mortals<br> the Bird of Peace...<br> so that you may<br> change your ways...<br> and end this destruction.<br> What a show!<br> Everyone was terrific.<br> Paul, your second act monologue<br> actually gave me the chills.<br> - Ah, thanks, Eddie.<br> - I got the early edition<br> hot off the presses!<br> This is the big moment.<br> Oh, what does that old queen<br> know? she didn`t even show.<br> sent her copy boy<br> to do the dirty work.<br> screw you, Miss Crowley.<br> Do I really have a face<br> like a horse?<br> What does ``ostentatious`` mean?<br> Hey, it`s not that bad.<br> You can`t concentrate on the negative.<br> Look, he`s got some<br> nice things to say here.<br> ``The soldiers` costumes are very<br> realistic.`` That`s positive!<br> - Rave of the century.<br> - Well, I`ve seen a lot worse reviews.<br> I`ve seen reviews where they<br> didn`t even mention the costumes.<br> Like that last Francis the Mule picture.<br> It got terrible notices. Huge hit!<br> - Lines around the block.<br> - That`s right.<br> Don`t take it too seriously.<br> We`re all doing great work.<br> - Do you really think so?<br> - Absolutely.<br> Honey, what if I`m wrong?<br> What if I just don`t got it?<br> Ed, it was only one review.<br> Orson Welles was only 26<br> when he made Citizen Kane.<br> I`m already 30.<br> Ed, you`re still young.<br> And this is the time in your life<br> when you`re supposed to be struggling.<br> I know. But I`m just scared that it`s<br> not gonna get any better than this.<br> Oh, I hate having<br> to wake up this early.<br> Gosh, where`s my pink sweater?<br> I can never seem to find<br> my clothes anymore.<br> Hey, big shot! Get off your ass and get<br> this over to the executive building.<br> -sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.<br> -Hey, Charlie, there, come here.<br> Come here. What`d I tell you<br> about watering these plants, huh?<br> I want some water on `em! Don`t<br> sprinkle the damn things! soak `em!<br> Hi.<br> All right, people, settle!<br> And... action!<br> Wow! Look at these camels.<br> These are real camels.<br> Gosh, where`d<br> they get real camels?<br> Hey, you.<br> Move it outta here, huh?<br> Hey, Eddie!<br> Come in here.<br> I got some great<br> new stuff to show you.<br> This is fantastic.<br> What are you gonna do with it?<br> Probably file it away<br> and never see it again.<br> Oh, it`s such a waste.<br> Why, if I had half the chance,<br> I could make an entire movie<br> using this stock footage.<br> The story opens on these<br> mysterious explosions.<br> Nobody knows what`s causing them,<br> but it`s upsetting all the buffalo.<br> so the military are called in<br> to solve the mystery.<br> - You forgot the octopus.<br> - No, no.<br> I`m saving that for<br> my big underwater climax.<br> - Hello. May I help you?<br> - Hello.<br> They say he was a girl<br> trapped in a man`s body.<br> I bet it hurt when<br> they cut his thing off.<br> - Ugh!<br> - What are you ladies gabbin` about?<br> You know that ChristineJorgensen freak?<br> He-- she-- It`s in Variety.<br> some producer`s makin`<br> a bio pic.<br> Really? I didn`t read<br> that story.<br> Yes. I`ve got Mr. Edward Wood on<br> the line. Could you please hold?<br> Mr. Weiss?<br> Ed Wood here.<br> Listen, I-I heard about your<br> new project, and I was curious<br> if you`d signed a director yet?<br> Oh, you haven`t!<br> Well, if we could get together,<br> I could explain to you...<br> why I`m more qualified to direct<br> this than anyone else in town.<br> Well, I`d rather not<br> go into that over the phone.<br> All right. Great!<br> I`ll see ya then. Bye.<br> Eddie, I don`t understand. Why are<br> you the most qualified director...<br> - for the ChristineJorgensen story?<br> - Oh, it`s just hogwash, hon.<br> I had to get<br> in the door somehow.<br> No, I love you like a brother.<br> Listen to me. No, no, no, no.<br> No, no, no. I didn`t stop that.<br> That`s a falsehood. No. Listen.<br> Come in!<br> Look, look, look. When I said that you<br> could have the western territories...<br> I didn`t mean all 1 1 states!<br> I meant California,<br> Oregon, and, uh--<br> What`s that one on top? Ah,<br> W-W-- Washington! Yeah, yeah!<br> Wh-- Oh, really?<br> Well, screw you!<br> - Hi. Can I help ya?<br> - Yes, I`m Ed Wood.<br> I`m here about directing<br> the ChristineJorgensen picture.<br> Well, a couple of things<br> have changed.<br> It ain`t gonna be the Christine<br> Jorgensen story no more.<br> Goddamn Variety had to print<br> the story before I got the rights!<br> Now that bitch is asking<br> for the sky.<br> Ah, you`re not gonna<br> make the movie.<br> No, of course I`m gonna<br> make the picture.<br> I already presold Alabama<br> and Oklahoma.<br> Those repressed Okies, they go<br> for that twisted, perverted stuff.<br> We`ll just do it without the she-male.<br> We`ll fictionalize it.<br> - Is there a script?<br> - Fuck no! But there`s a poster.<br> It opens in nine weeks<br> in Tulsa.<br> Well, Mr. Weiss, look no further.<br> I`m your man.<br> I work fast and I`m a deal.<br> I write and direct. And I`m good.<br> I just did a play in Hollywood<br> and Victor Crowley himself<br> praised its realism.<br> There`s about 500 guys in this town<br> that can say the same thing.<br> On the phone you said you had<br> some special qualifications?<br> Mr. Weiss...<br> I have never told anyone...<br> what I`m about to tell you...<br> but I really want this job.<br> I like to dress<br> in women`s clothing.<br> - You`re a fruit?<br> - No, not at all. I love women.<br> Wearing their clothes<br> makes me feel closer to them.<br> - You`re not a fruit.<br> - No, I`m all man.<br> I even fought in W.W. II.<br> Of course, I was wearing<br> women`s undergarments under my uniform.<br> - Ya gotta be kidding me.<br> - Confidentially...<br> I even paratrooped wearing<br> a brassiere and panties.<br> I tell ya, I wasn`t scared<br> of being killed, but I was<br> terrified of getting wounded...<br> and having the medics<br> discover my secret.<br> so you think this qualifies<br> you to make my movie?<br> Yes. I know what it`s like<br> to live with a secret...<br> and worry about what people<br> are gonna think of ya.<br> My girlfriend still doesn`t know why<br> her sweaters are always stretched out.<br> Ed, you seem like a nice kid.<br> Look around you.<br> I don`t hire directors with<br> burning desires to tell their stories.<br> I make movies<br> like Chained Girls.<br> I need someone with experience<br> who can shoot a film in four days<br> and make me a profit.<br> I`m sorry.<br> That`s all that matters.<br> Can I get you<br> anything else, kid?<br> Too constrictive.<br> I can`t even fold my arms.<br> Gee, Mr. Lugosi, I`ve-I`ve<br> never had any complaints.<br> This is the most uncomfortable<br> coffin I`ve ever been in.<br> Your selection is quite shoddy.<br> You`re wasting my time!<br> - Mr. Lugosi.<br> - I told you I don`t want any<br> of your goddamn coffins!<br> No, no. I don`t work here.<br> - Then who are you? What do you want?<br> - I don`t want anything.<br> I just-- I`m a really big, big fan.<br> I`ve seen all your movies.<br> - Mr. Lugosi,<br> why are you buying a coffin?<br> - I`m planning on dying soon.<br> - No.<br> - Yes! I`m embarking on another<br> bus and truck tour of Dracula.<br> Twelve cities in ten days,<br> if that`s conceivable.<br> Do you know that I saw you perform<br> Dracula in Poughkeepsie in 1 938?<br> That was a terrible production.<br> Renfield was a drunk!<br> I thought it was great.<br> You know, you`re-you`re<br> much scarier in real life...<br> than you are in the movie.<br> Thank you.<br> I even waited outside to get<br> your autograph, but you never came out.<br> Well, I apologize. When I play Dracula,<br> I put myself into a trance.<br> It takes me much time<br> to reemerge.<br> Oh, there`s my bus.<br> shit! Where is my transfer?<br> - say, don`t you have a car?<br> - I refuse to drive in this country.<br> Too many madmen.<br> I`ve got a car.<br> Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead<br> such an exciting life.<br> When is your next picture<br> coming out?<br> I have no next picture.<br> Ya gotta be jokin`.<br> A great star like you.<br> You must have dozens<br> of`em lined up.<br> Back in the old days, yes.<br> But now, no one gives<br> two fucks for Bela.<br> - But you`re a big star.<br> - No more.<br> I haven`t worked<br> in four years.<br> This business, this town,<br> it chews you up, then spits you out.<br> I`m just an ex-bogeyman.<br> Make a right.<br> They don`t want<br> the classic horror films anymore.<br> Today, it`s all giant bugs.<br> Giant spiders,<br> giant grasshoppers.<br> Who would believe<br> such nonsense?<br> The old ones were much spookier;<br> they had castles and full moons.<br> They were mythic.<br> - They had a poetry to them.<br> - Yes.<br> And you know what else?<br> The women--<br> The women preferred<br> the traditional monsters.<br> The women. Huh.<br> The pure horror, it both<br> repels and attracts them.<br> Because in their<br> collective unconsciousness...<br> they have the agony<br> of childbirth.<br> - Oh.<br> - The blood--<br> The blood is horror.<br> You know, I never<br> thought of that.<br> Take my word for it.<br> If you want to make out with a young<br> lady, you take her to see Dracula.<br> Eh, what a mess.<br> My wife of 20 years<br> left me last month.<br> I`m not much of a housekeeper.<br> All right, I`m coming!<br> - I`ll feed you, my darlings.<br> I`ll feed you.<br> - Well, I better get going.<br> But, uh, perhaps we could get together<br> again sometime, Mr. Lugosi.<br> Certainly.<br> But now...<br> the children of the night<br> are calling me.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> sweetie, you won`t believe it.<br> I`ve got incredible news.<br> - Ya got the job!<br> - No, I didn`t get the job,<br> but something better happened.<br> - Better than not getting the job.<br> - Yes!<br> I met a movie star.<br> somebody really big.<br> Who? Robert Taylor?<br> No. A horror movie star.<br> - Boris Karloff.<br> - Close.<br> The other one.<br> You met... Basil Rathbone!<br> Oh, to heck with you.<br> I met Bela Lugosi.<br> - Well, I thought he was dead.<br> - No, he`s very much alive.<br> Well... sort of.<br> He`s old and frail, but he`s-- he`s<br> still Bela Lugosi, and he`s really nice.<br> Well, I can`t even remember<br> the last time I saw him in a picture.<br> It`s a shame. He`s such a great actor,<br> and no one uses him anymore.<br> -so, did you get his autograph?<br> -No, it wasn`t like that at all.<br> It was just the two of us<br> and we were talking and--<br> He treated me like a friend.<br> - Yeah, well, he`s a bum!<br> - No, he`s not.<br> Do you have any idea how much<br> money he made for this studio?<br> - Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Well, now he`s a junkie.<br> He don`t deserve to work.<br> - That is not true.<br> He`s so great,<br> you hire him.<br> Yeah, well I would<br> if I could.<br> - Trick or treat!<br> - The house looks like<br> they have lots of kids.<br> Ooh, those eyes.<br> He gives me the willies.<br> Oh, I hate it when she<br> interrupts the picture.<br> - she doesn`t show `em<br> the proper respect.<br> - ...Charlie from--<br> - I think she`s a honey.<br> - ...talk about the living dead.<br> - And then I tried to meet him...<br> - Look at those jugs.<br> but he stood me up<br> at the restaurant.<br> I guess I shouldn`t<br> have picked a steak house.<br> And then I went out with the<br> Wolf Man. Ugh. What an evening.!<br> - I didn`t know whether<br> to kiss him good night--<br> - Vampira...<br> you will come under<br> my spell.<br> You will be<br> my slave of love.<br> My gosh, Bela.<br> How do you do that?<br> You must be double-jointed.<br> And you must be Hungarian.<br> Vampira, look at me.<br> Look into my eyes.<br> You`re watching our<br> Halloween movie, White Zombie...<br> starring Bela Lugosi,<br> John Harron, Madge Bellamy...<br> and a bunch of other people<br> I`ve never heard of.<br> I`m very tired.<br> I need to take my medicine.<br> - Do you want me to get it for you?<br> - No.<br> Thank you, Eddie.<br> I`ll be all right.<br> Oh, shit!<br> I feel much better.<br> Children! I love children!<br> Trick or treat!<br> Aren`t you scared,<br> little boy?<br> I`m going to drink<br> your blood.<br> You`re not a real vampire.<br> Those teeth<br> don`t frighten me.<br> How `bout these?<br> Hey, how`d you do that?<br> Dentures. Lost my pearlies<br> in the war.<br> so, what was the important news you<br> couldn`t tell me on the phone, again?<br> Well, I started thinkin` about<br> what you were saying about...<br> how your movies need<br> to make a profit.<br> Now, what is the one thing if you put<br> it in a movie, it`ll be successful?<br> - Tits.<br> - No, better than that. A star.<br> Ed, you must have me confused<br> with David selznick.<br> I don`t make major motion pictures.<br> I make crap.<br> Yes, but if you take that crap and put<br> a star in it, then you`ve got something.<br> - Yeah. Crap with a star.<br> - No, something better!<br> something impressive.<br> Maybe the biggest money-maker<br> you`ve ever had.<br> Fine, all right.<br> You may be right.<br> But it doesn`t frickin` matter.<br> I can`t afford a star, so what<br> are we even talkin` about?<br> All right. What if I told you<br> you could have a star for $1 ,000?<br> Who?<br> - Lugosi?<br> - Yes! Lugosi!<br> - Isn`t he dead?<br> - No, he`s not dead.<br> He lives in Baldwin Hills.<br> I met him recently and he really<br> wants to be in our movie.<br> - Why would Lugosi wanna do<br> a sex-change flick?<br> - Because he`s my friend.<br> All right, fine! You can direct it.<br> I want a script in three days.<br> We start shooting<br> a week from Monday.<br> Oh. Oh, Mr. Weiss.<br> Thank you so much. You won`t<br> regret it. I won`t let you down.<br> But, Bunny, you`re perfect for<br> this job. You know these people.<br> I need all the transsexuals<br> and transvestites I can get.<br> No, I don`t care if they`re<br> not actors. I want realism.<br> I want this film<br> to tell the truth. Coming!<br> I`ve waited all my life for this shot,<br> and I`m not gonna blow it.<br> Eddie, you got a new movie<br> for me, eh?<br> Yes.

I`ve always<br> wanted to playJekyll and Hyde.<br> I`m looking forward<br> to this production.<br> Well, your part`s<br> a little different.<br> You`re like the god that looks over all<br> the characters and oversees everything.<br> - I don`t understand.<br> - You control everyone`s fate.<br> You`re like the puppetmaster.<br> Ah, so I pull the strings.<br> Yes, you pull the strings.<br> ``Pull the strings.``<br> I like that!<br> Honey. I got<br> a little surprise for ya.<br> Wipe off your hands.<br> - I finished my script.<br> - Oh!<br> Ed, I`m so proud of you!<br> Oh, I`ll read it<br> as soon as I get home.<br> Well, I`d-- Well, you know,<br> I`d really like to know what you think.<br> Why don`t you go in the bedroom<br> and take a look?

By putting it in a fucking<br> script for everyone to see?<br> What kind of sick mind<br> operates like that?<br> And what about this, this so-called<br> Barbara character that`s obviously me.<br> I mean, this is our life.<br> It`s so embarrassing!<br> Of course it is. That`s why<br> you should play the part.<br> - Oh, you got nerve, buddy.<br> - It`s a darn good role.<br> That`s not the issue!<br> God, how can you act so casual<br> when you`re dressed like that?<br> It makes me<br> feel comfortable.<br> Oh,just like<br> in the script.<br> Exactly.<br> so what do you say?<br> Do we break up?<br> Or do you want to make<br> the movie with me?<br> They make you tall, and<br> you`re flashy. They want that.<br> Okay. But they want professionalism,<br> so nix on the nelly...<br> without losing<br> naivete, okay?<br> Now, the good news is you`re<br> probably gonna get hired<br> because you look like Peggy Lee.<br> But I don`t want anybody else<br> to resent that, okay? Please?<br> `Cause there`s enough<br> for everybody, exotics too.<br> David, if you`re not gonna smile, please<br> don`t bother. You`ll embarrass me.<br> -This is George Weiss. He`s done<br> some very important things.<br> -You`re wrong. They work<br> with high artistic merit.<br> - He`s a nice person to know.

Trust me.<br> You`ll be better off.<br> This story`s gonna grab people.<br> It`s about this guy.<br> He`s crazy about this girl,<br> but he likes to wear dresses.<br> should he tell her? should he not tell<br> her?

That seems<br> very reasonable for an entire picture.<br> Would you--<br> Would you like to, uh...<br> have a look at the--<br> at the photoplay?<br> Oh, sure.<br> Oh, my.<br> This is very interesting.<br> say, do you think it would be possible<br> for me to maybe play one of these parts?<br> Oh, you want to be an actress too.<br> Well, of course.<br> You know, there`s, there`s a couple<br> of parts I can think of right now<br> that you might be perfect for.<br> There`s, uh, the secretary in the<br> newspaper office, the file clerk, umm--<br> Hmm. Those sound<br> kind of small.<br> Here`s one that looks good.<br> Janet Lawton.<br> - I`d sure like to play her.<br> -Janet Lawton.<br> Yes.Janet Lawton is clearly<br> the part to play.<br> Can`t you just see me<br> in the part?<br> Yes.

I`m color-blind.<br> But I kinda like<br> the dark gray one.<br> At Universal, we used to shoot<br> one or two scenes a day.<br> But Eddie can knock off 20, 30.<br> He`s incredible!<br> And action.<br> Okay, you`re Dr. Eric Vornoff,<br> and you`re upset.<br> You`ve worked very hard<br> on this experiment and you<br> don`t want to see it fail.<br> N-No, you`re not that upset.<br> You want to keep moving.<br> You want to go<br> through that door.<br> And cut.

Loretta, Tor,<br> I want to explain this scene to you.<br> It`s a little complicated, but, uh--<br> Bela, you`ll be sitting there, okay?<br> I`m not getting near<br> that goddamned thing.<br> One of them burned me<br> in The Return of Chandu.<br> All right.<br> Then you`ll be sitting there.<br> - Good.<br> - Great.<br> All right, gang, here`s the scene.<br> Loretta, you`re in a trance.<br> You glide in and get on<br> the operating table. Now, Tor,<br> you`re supposed to tie her down...<br> but you have an Angora fetish,<br> and when you rub that swatch<br> of Angora it makes you refuse.<br> so then Bela has to<br> discipline you. All right?<br> - Great. Let`s do it!<br> - Okay.<br> Action.<br> strap her to the table.<br> Do as I command you!<br> I`ll teach you<br> to disobey me!<br> You will obey!<br> strap her in!<br> strap her in!<br> I command you!<br> - Wood! Your check bounced.<br> - Eh-Eh, fine. I`ll get you<br> the money later.<br> - I`ll teach you to disobey me!<br> - No, I need it now.<br> Cut!<br> I am terribly sorry to bother<br> you while you`re shooting...<br> but the guy that owns the stage<br> needs his money.<br> Well, then you should pay him,<br> shouldn`t you?<br> Yes. Exactly.<br> I kind of need it now.<br> What are you looking at me<br> like that for?<br> I already gave you my 300.<br> Right. And now I need<br> the other 60,000.<br> What other 60,000?<br> The other 60,000<br> you said you`d give to me.<br> You misunderstood, Eddie. I gave you<br> everything I have in the world.<br> Three hundred dollars.<br> Well, here we go again.<br> Let me tell you,<br> ya can`t lose.<br> It`s scary. And if you don`t<br> like that, it`s romantic.<br> Bela Lugosi will portray<br> Dr. Eric Vornoff.<br> And lovely, lovely, lovely<br> ingenue Loretta King...<br> is reporterJanet Lawton.<br> - I don`t know. Lugosi looks pretty old.<br> - Huh?<br> Which role does<br> Vampira play?<br> - Vampira? Why do you ask?<br> - she`s standing right over there.<br> Well, she plays--<br> Excuse me one minute.<br> - Pardon me, Miss Vampira?<br> - Yes?<br> Uh, you don`t know me, but I`m<br> Ed Wood. I`m a film producer...<br> and I`m currently in production<br> on a science-fiction piece...<br> with Bela Lugosi and<br> swedish wrestler TorJohnson.<br> I don`t understand.<br> Do you want my autograph?<br> No. No, I, I think my film<br> is perfect for you.<br> You want me to show it on my TV program?<br> Well, I have nothing to do with that.<br> You should call the<br> station manager at Channel 7.<br> No, no. No, no. No, no.<br> I don`t want you to show the<br> movie. I want you to be in it.<br> Let me explain. We started shooting,<br> but after three days we got shut down.<br> Now we`re having a backers<br> party to raise some more money.<br> so I thought perhaps you`d like<br> to come over and just say howdy<br> to some of the backers.<br> Look, I`m with some friends<br> and we`re about to eat.<br> Please! It would<br> just take one second.<br> Come on over and meet the backers! There<br> is a really nice dentist from Oxnard.<br> Look, buddy, I`ve got real<br> offers from real studios.<br> I don`t need to blow some<br> dentist for a part. Forget it.<br> Miss Vampira! Please.<br> Let`s go.<br> I`m getting a bad feeling about<br> this. Let`s get outta here.<br> Yeah, I think you`re right.<br> Thank you folks for coming<br> tonight, but we`d better go.<br> And then, Dr. Vornoff<br> falls into the pit...<br> and his own octopus<br> attacks and eats him.<br> The End.<br> - That`s quite a story.<br> - Yes.<br> so, uh--<br> You made the movie...<br> and now you wanna<br> make it again?<br> No. We shot ten minutes of<br> the movie, and now we`re<br> looking for completion funds.<br> Oh, son,<br> you`re too vague.<br> Billy Bob!<br> You`re cuttin` `em<br> too lean.<br> Mr. McCoy?<br> How can I make you happy?<br> Okay.<br> Two things.

Number two...<br> I got a son...<br> an` he`s a little slow,<br> but a good boy.<br> And somethin` tells me he`d<br> make a hell of a leadin` man.<br> sounds perfect.<br> This is unbelievable.<br> I mean, I woulda bet a million bucks<br> that Ed wouldn`t finish this picture.<br> Yeah, well, it ain`t finished yet, kid.<br> Anything can happen.<br> -stay outta scratching distance.<br> -Oh, good, you made it.

You look like that Dracula guy.<br> My name is Bela Lugosi...<br> and I wish to<br> commit myself.<br> For what reason?<br> I have been a drug addict<br> for 20 years.<br> I need help.<br> Is that Angora?<br> Um, yes.<br> Don`t you think Angora<br> has a tactile sensuality...<br> lacking in all<br> other clothing?<br> Uh, I suppose.<br> It is awfully expensive.<br> Well, it`s made from specially-bred<br> rabbits that live in the Himalayas.<br> say, what are you,<br> an Angora wholesaler?<br> No.<br> No.<br> I`m in pictures.<br> I`m a director, writer,<br> actor and producer.<br> Aw, come on.<br> Nobody does all that.<br> Oh, yes they do.

Has he been here long?<br> This is my 1 3th pair.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me, Doctor,<br> I`m with Mr. Lugosi. How is he?<br> Well, there`s a lot of junk in<br> his system for such an old man.<br> Apparently,<br> he was addicted to morphine,<br> and then he tried to kick that...<br> and he got readdicted<br> to methadone.<br> - Is he gonna be okay?<br> - We`ll do our best.<br> - Yes.<br> - Hi, Lillian.<br> - Oh, hi, Ed.

Come on.<br> Trash barrel!<br> - Bela, what happened?<br> - Eddie, why did you chase them?<br> After all these years, the press is<br> finally interested again in Bela Lugosi.<br> Bela, those people are parasites.<br> They just want to exploit you.<br> Fine. Let them.<br> There is no such thing<br> as bad press, Eddie.<br> Man from New York even said he`s<br> putting me on the front page!<br> First celebrity ever<br> to check into rehab.<br> When I get out of here...<br> I will be healthy, strong...<br> primed for my comeback.<br> - Hello again.<br> - Hi.<br> - You look beat.<br> - No, I-I`m fine.

You know,<br> all-American small town.<br> Everybody knows everybody. My dad worked<br> for the post office. I was a Boy scout.<br> - Did you find it boring?<br> - No. Not at all.<br> I had my comic books<br> and pulp magazines.<br> Used to listen to the<br> radio dramas constantly.<br> - I love those shows.<br> The Shadow, Inner Sanctum.<br> - Yes.<br> - And the Mercury Theatre<br> with Orson Welles.<br> - Mmm.<br> Boy, you know, every saturday<br> afternoon me and my dad...<br> marched down the street in our uniform<br> to the little movie theater.<br> Ah! Oh, the spook house!<br> You`re not going to believe<br> the first picture I ever saw.<br> It was your friend`s.<br> Dracula.<br> Oh, that`s incredible. That`s<br> the first picture I ever saw.<br> That is incredible. You know, I had<br> to sleep with the lights on for a week.<br> I had to sleep with<br> the lights on for a month...<br> but I never missed a Lugosi<br> picture after that one.<br> A few years ago, I actually<br> saw him do Dracula live.<br> It was much scarier<br> in person.<br> Oh. We`re stuck.<br> Kathy...<br> I`m about to tell you something that<br> I never told any girl on a first date.<br> But I think it`s important<br> that you know...<br> I like to wear women`s clothes.<br> -Huh?<br> -I like to wear women`s clothes.<br> Panties, brassieres,<br> sweaters, pumps.<br> It`s just something I do.<br> And I can`t believe I`m telling<br> you this, but I really like you...<br> and I don`t want it getting<br> in the way down the road.<br> Does this mean you don`t<br> like sex with girls?<br> No, I love sex with girls.<br> Okay.<br> Okay?<br> Okay.<br> You see, we thought that Mr. Lugosi<br> was insured through his union.<br> - Isn`t he?<br> - No. They say that his<br> eligibility ran out years ago.<br> Look, Doctor.<br> He doesn`t have any money,<br> but I`ll give you everything I`ve got.<br> - I have a few hundred dollars.<br> - That won`t even begin to cover it.<br> He`s gonna have to leave.<br> Bela? Bela.<br> Wake up.<br> I`ve got some great news.<br> The doctor says you`re all better<br> and you can go home now.<br> Really?<br> I don`t feel so great.<br> No? Well, you look<br> just peachy.<br> And the-- the tests<br> came back fine.<br> Come on. Let`s get up.<br> Here we go.<br> Attaboy. Good.<br> Eddie...<br> I want to make another picture.<br> When are we going to make<br> another picture?<br> Oh, soon, Bela.<br> Very soon.<br> This is so exciting.<br> Another production.<br> Isn`t it?<br> so, Eddie, shouldn`t we<br> have a sound crew?<br> Uh, no, no. Because this<br> is just second unit stuff.<br> We`re going to do the main<br> footage later. All right?<br> so what`s the scene about?<br> Um.<br> You`re a very important<br> and respected man.<br> And you`re leaving your house.<br> You`re-- You`re in a hurry.<br> You`re on your way to a big<br> social brouhaha. Okay?<br> Eddie, what if I`m not<br> in so big a hurry?<br> What if I take a moment<br> to slow down...<br> to savor the beauty of life...<br> to-- to smell a budding flower?<br> That`s great. That is great.<br> Let`s do a take. Okay?<br> Ed, I`m really busy.<br> What do you want now?<br> Listen, I was calling to see if you`d<br> like to attend the world premiere...<br> of my new movie,<br> Bride of the Monster.<br> Didn`t you just make one<br> called Bride of the Atom?<br> Yes, it`s the same film, but the<br> distributor wanted a punchier title.<br> Come on, it`s gonna be<br> a big event. Bela, Tor and Cris<br> are coming. You`ll have fun.<br> I can`t see. These contact<br> lenses are hurting.<br> - My eyes are killing me.<br> - Don`t worry. We`re almost there.<br> Hi. Right in there.<br> Thank God you`re here.<br> They`re tearing up the place.<br> Come on. Come on!<br> Come on. This way.<br> Come on! Come on!<br> I`ve never been<br> to a movie premiere before.<br> Well, go knock `em dead.<br> At the stroke of midnight...<br> the witching hour...<br> the ghouls arise...<br> from the dead.<br> - Hey, Vampira, how `bout a little love?<br> - Fuck off.<br> One of them stole my wallet!<br> - I can`t see!<br> - Get `em off me!<br> - Come on. Let`s go!<br> I gotta save `em.<br> Get your heads down.<br> Come on. Let`s go!<br> - We`re gettin` the heck outta here!<br> - Okay, let`s go.<br> I can`t see!<br> I can`t see!<br> Hey, come on. Let`s split!<br> Taxi!<br> - stop!<br> - Get in! Get in! Aw, go on! Get in!<br> Now, that was a premiere.<br> Eddie...<br> last night was quite a romp.<br> Did you see that kid grab<br> Vampira`s boobies?<br> I envied him.<br> Hell, I envied you too.<br> A girlfriend who would jump<br> in front of a car like that.<br> Yes, she is quite something.<br> None of my wives would have.<br> Eddie...<br> I want to thank you.<br> These last few days<br> have been...<br> a good time.<br> You know, I just-- I just wish<br> you coulda seen the movie.<br> Ahh. No problem.<br> I know it by heart.<br> Home.<br> I have no home.<br> Hunted...<br> despised...<br> living like an animal.<br> The jungle is my home.<br> But I shall show the world<br> that I can be its master!<br> I shall perfect<br> my own race of people...<br> a race of atomic supermen...<br> that will conquer the world!<br> Uh, M-M-Mr. Lugosi, could I<br> have your autograph, please?<br> - Certainly.<br> - Why, that was-- that was incredible.<br> - I mean, you`re just<br> as great as you ever were.<br> - Better.<br> I`m 7 4, but I don`t know it.<br> When the brain is young,<br> the spirit is still vigorous...<br> like-- like a young man.<br> ``And left the planet Mars...<br> never to return again.``<br> - The end.<br> - Mmm.<br> Wood Productions.<br> Hey, whose crazy idea was it<br> to bury him in the cape?<br> I heard it was in the will.<br> It was how he wanted<br> to be remembered.<br> Could you run it again?<br> - Mr. Wood?<br> - Huh?<br> Uh, Mr. Wood, this is<br> Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.<br> Could you please open up?<br> One minute.<br> - Yes?<br> - Uh, Mr. Wood, you have bounced...<br> your third and final rent check.<br> I`m terribly sorry. My-my-my-my<br> stockbroker must have<br> transferred the wrong account.<br> Come on in.<br> I`ll write you another check.<br> Ohh, I see you`re in<br> the picture business.<br> -Yes.<br> -I`m interested in the picture business.<br> My associates and I,<br> we wish to produce...<br> a series of uplifting<br> religious films...<br> about the apostles.<br> But unfortunately<br> we don`t have enough money.<br> Oh. Raising money`s tough.<br> No, our church has enough money<br> for one film.<br> We just don`t have enough<br> for all twelve.<br> Well, you know what you do?<br> You produce a film in<br> a commercially-proven genre...<br> and then after it`s a hit, you<br> take the profits from that and<br> you make the 1 2 apostles movie.<br> - Would that work?<br> - Absolutely.<br> Let me show you something.<br> You see this script?<br> Grave Robbers from Outer Space.<br> Money in the bank.<br> Grave robbers from what?<br> From outer space. It`s science<br> fiction. Very big with the kids.<br> If you make this picture, you`ll<br> have enough money to finance<br> a hundred religious films...<br> and pay my back rent<br> with the profits.<br> I don`t know. This is, um,<br> all a lot to absorb.<br> - It`s a guaranteed blockbuster.<br> - Mmm.<br> Well, I understand this science fiction<br> is very popular, but, um...<br> uh, don`t the big hits<br> always have big stars?<br> Well, we have a big star.<br> Bela Lugosi.<br> Bela Lugosi--<br> Oh, I thought he passed on.<br> Yes. Yes, he did.<br> But...<br> I`ve got the last footage<br> he ever shot.<br> Well, it doesn`t look<br> like very much.<br> Mr. Reynolds...<br> this is the acorn<br> that will grow a great oak.<br> I`ll just get a double to finish<br> his scenes, and we`ll release it<br> as Bela Lugosi`s final film.<br> Bunny, we`re making<br> another movie.<br> Yes, I got the Baptist Church<br> of Beverly Hills to put up the cash.<br> - Hold on.<br> - Ed, I got the Lugosi doubles outside.<br> Bunny, I gotta go.<br> He`s too short.<br> He`s too tall.<br> - He`s just not going to work.<br> - Well, Ed, I was thinkin`...<br> like when Bela played Fu Manchu.<br> - Paul, that was Karloff.<br> - Oh.<br> - You`re gonna have to try harder.<br> - Okay.<br> - Try to be a cut above.<br> - Okay.<br> - Go get `em.<br> - Right.<br> - Oh. Keep sunday open.<br> - The producers want us to get baptized.<br> - Okay.<br> You know, hon, when you rewrite a<br> script, it just gets better and better.<br> This is the ultimate Ed Wood movie.<br> No compromises.<br> - Oh, my. Eddie.<br> - Hmm?<br> - Look at this.<br> What?<br> Poor girl`s out of a job.<br> I brought the script. You`ll<br> be portraying the ghoul`s wife.<br> - The ghoul`s wife?<br> - Yes.<br> You should feel lucky. Eddie`s<br> the only fella in town who<br> doesn`t pass judgment on people.<br> That`s right. If I did,<br> I wouldn`t have any friends.<br> Look, would it be possible to make the<br> ghoul`s wife a little less prominent...<br> so people wouldn`t really<br> notice me in the movie?<br> - You don`t want to be noticed?<br> - Yeah. How about this?<br> What if I don`t have any lines?<br> I`ll play the part mute.<br> - Mute?<br> - Hey, it`s Dr. Tom.<br> - Dr. Tom! Hiya!<br> - Who`s Dr. Tom?<br> - He`s my chiropractor.<br> - Hey, Kathy. How are you?<br> - Fine, thanks.<br> - Well, look at you. You`re<br> looking in alignment today.<br> Well, actually, my neck<br> is a little funny.<br> Oh, here.<br> Let me fix that.<br> - Ooh!<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> My gosh!<br> Don`t move.<br> It`s uncanny.<br> Look at his head!<br> It`s uncanny!<br> Lift up your voice<br> and let us sing<br> Alleluia, alleluia<br> - Oh, burning sun and golden sea<br> - He looks nothin` like Bela.<br> - He`s kinda got his ears.<br> - Oh, look. Cover your face with this.<br> - Oh. Now I can see it.<br> - I want to suck your blood.<br> I want to suck your blood!<br> -Alleluia<br> - Let`s hear you call<br> Boris Karloff a cocksucker.<br> - Alleluia<br> - shh!<br> - Alleluia<br> - We want these Baptists<br> to like us. Please?<br> Brothers and sisters...<br> we reach now in the service<br> a joyous point...<br> because we are going to bear witness<br> to the baptism of our new members.<br> Why couldn`t we do this<br> in the church?<br> Because Brother Tor couldn`t<br> fit in the sacred tub.<br> Welcome to the fold, brother.<br> - Do you acceptJesus Christ<br> as your personal savior?<br> - Yes!<br> In the name of the Father,<br> the son and the Holy Ghost.<br> Amen.<br> Welcome to the fold, brother.<br> Welcome.<br> Praise the Lord, brother.<br> - Do you reject satan and all his evils?<br> - sure.<br> In the name of the Father,<br> the son and the Holy Ghost.<br> Praise the Lord, friends!<br> - Do you repent for all of your sins?<br> - How do you do it?<br> - I do.<br> - How do you get all your<br> friends to get baptized...<br> - The Father, the son,<br> and the Holy Ghost.<br> -just so you can make a monster movie?<br> It`s not a monster movie.<br> It`s a supernatural thriller.<br> Come toJesus, brother!<br> I can`t believe this.<br> - Ed, what am I gonna do here?<br> - What do you mean?<br> - He has no hair.<br> - Ah, gee, I never noticed that.<br> Put a wig on him.<br> Before we start shooting, Mr. Wood,<br> uh, we have a few questions.<br> Yes. The script contains<br> numerous references to grave robbing.<br> Now, we find the concept<br> of digging up consecrated ground<br> to be highly offensive.<br> - It is blasphemy.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> It`s the premise of the movie. It`s the<br> title of the movie, for Christ`s sakes!<br> - Mr. Wood!<br> - Yes. About that title.<br> It strikes us<br> as very inflammatory.<br> Eh, why don`t we change it<br> to Plan 9 From Outer Space?<br> Huh! That`s ridiculous.<br> All right. And, action!<br> Medical examiner<br> been around yet?<br> Just left. Uh, the morgue wagon<br> oughta be along most any time.<br> - You get their statement?<br> - Yeah, but they`re pretty scared.<br> Fine mess like this<br> will frighten anyone.<br> You have one of the boys, uh,<br> take the guy and the girl<br> back to town. You take charge.<br> What`d you give him all the<br> lines for? He`s unintelligible.<br> Look, Lugosi`s dead<br> and Vampira won`t talk.<br> - I had to give somebody the dialogue.<br> - That is no answer!<br> What about glitter?<br> When I was a headliner in Paris,<br> audiences always liked it<br> when I sparkled.<br> No.<br> - Cat`s eyes.<br> - No!<br> - Well, I`m going to need some antennae.<br> - No!<br> You`re the ruler of the galaxy.<br> show a little taste!<br> see? No talking.<br> Isn`t he good?<br> - Cue Dr. Tom!<br> - N-Now?<br> Yes, now. Lurk him.<br> Be sure and keep<br> your face covered.<br> Isn`t it wonderful?<br> Bela lives.<br> Doesn`t it strike you<br> as a bit morbid?<br> No. He would`ve loved it.<br> Bela`s returned from the grave,<br> just like Dracula.<br> Cue Vampira!<br> - And, cut!<br> - Let`s go down and find out<br> whose grave it is.<br> Oh, why do I always get hooked up<br> with these spook details?<br> Monsters, graves, bodies!<br> Cue flying saucer!<br> And cut! Print.<br> We`re moving on.<br> - That was perfect.<br> - Perfect? Mr. Wood...<br> - do you know anything about<br> the art of film production?<br> - Well, I like to think so.<br> That cardboard headstone<br> tipped over.<br> Th-This graveyard<br> is obviously phony.<br> Nobody will ever notice that.<br> Filmmaking is not<br> about the tiny details.<br> - It`s about the big picture.<br> - The big picture?<br> - Yes.<br> Then how about when the<br> policemen arrived in daylight,<br> but now it`s suddenly night?<br> What do you know? Haven`t you<br> heard of suspension of disbelief?<br> - Reverend, I`m here.<br> - Ohh!<br> - Who is he?<br> - This is our choir director.<br> He`s going to play<br> the young hero.<br> Are you people insane?<br> I`m the director!<br> I make the casting decisions<br> around here!<br> Well, I thought this<br> was a group effort.<br> No!<br> - No?<br> - They`re driving me crazy!<br> These Baptists are stupid,<br> stupid, stupid!<br> Okay. I gotta calm down.<br> Gotta calm down.<br> Gotta calm down.<br> Take a deep breath.<br> Relax.<br> All right, everybody.<br> Let`s get set up for scene 1 1 2.<br> Move the crypt stage left,<br> and let`s get Tor`s makeup effect ready.<br> - Mr. Wood, what do you<br> think you`re doing?<br> - I`m directing.<br> Not like that, you`re not!<br> Remove that getup immediately.<br> You shame our Lord.<br> That`s it! I can`t take it!<br> Take me to the nearest bar<br> and make it snappy.<br> Imperial Whiskey.<br> Oh, my gosh.<br> Orson Welles.<br> - Excuse me, sir?<br> - Yes?<br> Well, I`m a young filmmaker<br> and a real big fan.<br> I-- I just wanted<br> to meet you.<br> My pleasure.<br> I`m Orson Welles.<br> I`m, uh, Edward D. Wood,Jr.<br> What you working on?<br> Well, the financing just fell through<br> for the third time on Don Quixote.<br> Do you know? I can`t believe it. That<br> sounds just exactly like my problems.<br> It`s the damn money men. They never know<br> who`s a windbag and who`s got the goods.<br> - Then they all think they`re directors.<br> - Ain`t that the truth.<br> Do you know that I`ve even had<br> producers re-cut my movies?<br> - I hate when that happens.<br> - And they`re always trying<br> to cast their buddies.<br> - It doesn`t even matter<br> if they`re right for the part.<br> - Tell me about it.<br> I`m supposed to do<br> a thriller at Universal...<br> but they want Charlton Heston<br> to play a Mexican.<br> Ah, Mr. Welles,<br> is it all worth it?<br> It is when it works.<br> You know, the one film of mine<br> where I had total control, Kane?<br> The studio hated it...<br> but they didn`t get<br> to touch a frame.<br> - Ed.<br> - Yes?<br> Visions are worth fighting for.<br> Why spend your life making<br> someone else`s dreams?<br> Thank you...<br> Orson.<br> - Mr. Reynolds?<br> - Yes.<br> We are gonna finish this picture<br> just the way I want it...<br> because you cannot compromise<br> an artist`s vision.<br> -But it`s our money.<br> -And you`re gonna make a bundle...<br> but only if you shut up<br> and let me do things my way.<br> All right, gang. Actors in positions.<br> Let`s finish this picture.<br> Action!<br> Wanna give him a hand?<br> Keep rolling.<br> Now, that`s an alien.<br> Action!<br> - What plan will you follow now?<br> - Plan 9.<br> Plan 9. Ah, yes.<br> Plan 9 deals with<br> the resurrection of the dead.<br> Long-distance electrodes shot...<br> into the pineal and pituitary<br> glands of the recent dead.<br> You know, maybe you guys were right.<br> Plan 9 is a good title.<br> I want that lightning,<br> I want those two explosions...<br> - and I`ve got to have<br> more shots of the military!<br> - Right.<br> And, cut!<br> All right, friends.<br> Prepare for scene 3 2.<br> - M-Mr. Wood?<br> - Yeah?<br> - Where`s the cockpit set?<br> - You`re standing in it.<br> Places!<br> But what if we develop<br> this solenite bomb?<br> Then we`d be<br> a stronger nation too.<br> stronger? You see?<br> You see? Your stupid minds.<br> stupid! stupid!<br> - That`s all I`m gonna take out of you!<br> - Oh!<br> Cut. Action.<br> Greetings, my friend.<br> We are all interested<br> in the future...<br> for that is where you and I are going<br> to spend the rest of our lives.<br> And remember, my friend...<br> future events such as these<br> will effect you in the future.<br> And, cut!<br> That`s a wrap.<br> Ohh!<br> I can`t get it up.<br> It`s stuck.<br> Eddie, you`re gonna be late<br> for your own premiere.<br> All right. Forget it.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, you`re about<br> to see an extraordinary motion picture.<br> But before it begins, I think<br> we should all give a hand to the man...<br> without whom we wouldn`t<br> be here tonight.<br> Eddie, take a bow!<br> Thanks a million.<br> I just want to say...<br> that this film...<br> is for Bela.<br> The grief ofhis wife`s death...<br> became greater<br> and greater agony.<br> The home they had<br> so long shared together...<br> became a tomb...<br> a sweet memory<br> ofherjoyous living.<br> The sky to which<br> he had once looked...<br> was now only a covering<br> for her dead body.<br> The ever-beautiful flowers<br> she had planted...<br> with her own hands...<br> became nothing more than<br> the lost roses ofher cheeks.<br> Confused by his great loss...<br> the old man left that home...<br> never to return again.<br> This is the one.<br> This is the one<br> I`ll be remembered for.<br> Ah, gee, honey,<br> I`m so happy for ya.<br> - say, let`s get married.<br> - Huh?<br> - Right now. Let`s go to Vegas.<br> - But, Eddie, it`s pouring<br> and the car top is stuck.<br> - Phooey!<br> It`s only a five-hour drive,<br> and it`ll probably stop by<br> the time we get to the desert.<br> Heck, it`ll probably stop<br> by the time we get around the corner.<br> Let`s go.<br> Ohh!<br>
