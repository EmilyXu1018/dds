I doubt it.<br> Are you?<br> Men like you<br> because you're pretty,<br> and because you have<br> the ear of the Queen.<br> No doubt.<br> Him, too.<br> He likes you because<br> he wants my favor.<br> You do realize that.<br> Yes, my lady.<br> And the other thing,<br> too, of course.<br> But then,<br> all men want that.<br> Male desire<br> confers no distinction.<br> Oh, I envy you, Bess.<br> You're free to have<br> what I cannot have.<br> You're my adventurer.<br> Thank you for coming.<br> You mustrt send<br> letters to the palace.<br> You know what would<br> happen if I was caught.<br> I need your help.<br> More money?<br> No.<br> My father doesn't want<br> to hide like this anymore.<br> Of course.<br> We both want to get back<br> into favor with the court.<br> That's impossible.<br> You know that<br> you're Papists.<br> Why impossible?<br> Everyone at court has a Papist<br> somewhere in their family.<br> Francis.<br> Just as you have.<br> Speak to the Queen.<br> You are her favorite.<br> My father and I<br> will embrace the new faith.<br> Cousin Bess.<br> No.<br> We have known each other all our lives.<br> I would do nothing<br> to harm you.<br> Why can't you help us?<br> They will kill us!<br> Oh. Do not tease me,<br> Mr. Raleigh.<br> There's nothing<br> I'd like to do more.<br> So why don't you?<br> All right, then. I will.<br> You see? You lie.<br> You don't want me on your<br> ship at all. You're a liar.<br> Bess.
