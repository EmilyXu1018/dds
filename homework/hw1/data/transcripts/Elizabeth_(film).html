Clear the way!<br> Move back!<br> Keep in line, woman!<br> By order of their gracious Majesties,<br> Queen Mary and King Philip,<br> we are come to witness the burning<br> of these Protestant heretics<br> who have denied the authority<br> of the one true Catholic church<br> and of His Holiness the Pope.<br> Let them burn for all eternity<br> in the flames of hell.<br> Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,<br> Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.<br> Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,<br> Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.<br> Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,<br> Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.<br> God bless you, Master Ridley!<br> For the love of God, friends, help me!<br> I burn too slowly!<br> Help them!<br> For God's sake, help them!<br> Your Grace, the Queen is with child.<br> They should've consulted me<br> before they rang the bells.<br> Is it true?<br> She has ceased to bleed, her breasts have<br> some milk, and her stomach is swollen.<br> Is it true?<br> The King has not shared her bed<br> for many months.<br> He has a repugnance for it,<br> as lately Your Grace has for mine.<br> Norfolk...<br> Your Majesties,<br> this is most wondrous news.<br> Indeed.<br> We do thank God for this,<br> our most happy condition.<br> We must also thank His Majesty<br> for this event<br> which is nothing short of a miracle.<br> What news, my Lords,<br> of the rebellion against our authority?<br> Sussex?<br> Madam, it is safely dispatched,<br> thanks to His Grace.<br> Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other leaders<br> are already dealt with.<br> If they had succeeded,<br> these Protestants and heretics<br> meant to place your sister<br> upon the throne.<br> There is no proof<br> against the Lady Elizabeth.<br> - She is plainly guilty.<br> - What need is there of proof?<br> If she remains alive,<br> there will be plots to raise her<br> to the throne.<br> Ambassador?<br> I agree with His Grace.<br> She is a heretic.<br> She must never be allowed to succeed.<br> But if she...<br> If she were brought properly to trial,<br> she would not be found guilty,<br> and we would be condemned.<br> She has friends in Parliament.<br> My sister was born<br> of that whore Anne Boleyn!<br> She was born a bastard!<br> She will never rule England!<br> Your Grace will find some proof<br> of her treachery. I am most sure of it.<br> It was so fast!<br> May I join you, my Lady?<br> If it please you, sir.<br> My Lady!<br> My Lady!<br> Princess Elizabeth!<br> Princess Elizabeth!<br> You are accused of conspiring<br> with Sir Thomas Wyatt and others<br> against Her Sovereign Majesty<br> and are arrested for treason.<br> I am commanded to take you hence<br> from this place... to the Tower.<br> Remember who you are.<br> Do not be afraid of them.<br> My Lady.<br> Prisoner to the steps.<br> I cannot confess to something<br> I did not do.<br> Your denials are in vain.<br> You knew of the rebellion, Madam.<br> It is plain enough.<br> Where is your proof?<br> It was to your advantage.<br> You must let me see the Queen...<br> You despise the Queen,<br> and the Catholic faith.<br> I am a true and faithful subject.<br> I attend Mass...<br> You pretend! But in your heart...<br> What's that? What say you, Madam?<br> Speak up!<br> Madam, if there is some small truth<br> in these charges,<br> however innocently or unknowingly<br> you did proceed,<br> you had best confess.<br> I ask you<br> why we must tear ourselves apart<br> for this small question of religion.<br> Catholic, Protestant...!<br> You think it small,<br> though it killed your mother!<br> We all...<br> We all believe in God, my Lords.<br> No, Madam,<br> there is only one true belief.<br> The other-heresy.<br> Madam, you are cold.<br> I do not need your pity.<br> Accept it, then,<br> for my sake.<br> Thank you.<br> I shall not forget this kindness.<br> Tonight I think I die.<br> Madam.<br> No...!<br> Save me! Save me!<br> I am Your Majesty's most humble servant.<br> Come here.<br> Closer, so I might see your face.<br> When I look at you<br> I see nothing of the King.<br> Only that whore-your mother.<br> My father never did anything so well<br> as to cut off her head.<br> Your Majesty forgets<br> he was also my father.<br> Why will you not confess<br> your crimes against me?<br> Because, Your Majesty,<br> I have committed none.<br> You speak with such sincerity!<br> I see you are still a consummate actress.<br> My husband is gone.<br> They have poisoned my child.<br> They say it is a tumour.<br> Madam, you are not well.<br> They say this cancer<br> will make you Queen, but they are wrong!<br> Look there! It is your death warrant.<br> All I need do is sign it.<br> Mary, if you sign that paper,<br> you will be murdering your own sister.<br> You will promise me something?<br> When I am gone, you will<br> do everything in your power<br> to uphold the Catholic faith.<br> Do not take away from the people<br> the consolations of the Blessed Virgin.<br> When I am Queen<br> I promise<br> to act as my conscience dictates.<br> Well, do not think to be Queen at all.<br> You may return to your house at Hatfield,<br> but you will remain under arrest<br> until I am recovered.<br> Thank you, Your Majesty.<br> No...<br> Feed her to the wolves.<br> Let her see what they are like.<br> She is just a child,<br> and yet still you piss yourselves!<br> Your Grace,<br> Protestants are returning from abroad.<br> Yes, and have made plans to massacre<br> every Catholic in England.<br> There would be butchery indeed<br> if such a plan were even conceivable.<br> They say Walsingham<br> will return from France.<br> Walsingham is nothing!<br> Be sure he does not.<br> There is so little beauty in this world,<br> and so much suffering.<br> Do you suppose<br> that is what God had in mind?<br> That is to say, if there is a God at all.<br> Perhaps there is nothing<br> in this universe but ourselves<br> and our thoughts.<br> Think before you do this.<br> If you must do it,<br> then do it now.<br> And without regret.<br> But first think carefully<br> and be certain<br> why it needs to be done.<br> Look out there.<br> There is a whole world waiting for you.<br> Innocence<br> is the most precious thing you possess.<br> Lose that and you lose your soul.<br> ...et Spiritus Sancti...<br> Amen.<br> Father...<br> - Sir William!<br> - My Lady...<br> There was nowhere else<br> we could meet in safety.<br> Listen to me carefully.<br> All things move in our favour.<br> Many of our friends<br> are returning from exile.<br> But these are most uncertain times<br> and your life remains in danger.<br> You must therefore say nothing<br> and meet no-one<br> whose visit may compromise you.<br> No-one?<br> No-one. Not even Lord Robert.<br> - But he is a trusted friend.<br> - Child, listen to me. Please.<br> You are most innocent<br> in the ways of this world<br> and we must do all we may<br> to guarantee the security of your throne.<br> Now there is someone<br> I do wish you to meet.<br> Monseigneur Alvaro de la Quadra,<br> the Spanish Ambassador.<br> Why do I...<br> My Lady,<br> I bring a message.<br> The King of Spain is enraptured,<br> and offers you his hand in marriage.<br> My sister is not yet dead.<br> Her bed is still warm.<br> His Majesty finds it already cold.<br> You must sign it.<br> For the love of God, sign it.<br> Will you leave your kingdom to a heretic?<br> He then said that this King<br> would marry me<br> but would not expect to share my bed<br> more than two or three times a year.<br> As much as that?<br> Well, he...<br> He is enraptured.<br> Naturally.<br> But... his affairs would otherwise<br> keep him in Spain.<br> Then the King is a fool.<br> What could ever be important enough<br> to keep him from your bed?<br> Robert,<br> you should not say such things.<br> Then I shall only think them.<br> Everything is so uncertain!<br> Sir William says my life is still in danger.<br> Do not listen to everything he tells you.<br> Do not listen to any of them.<br> None of them are of consequence.<br> - When you are Queen...<br> - I am not... I am not Queen yet.<br> You will be.<br> Elizabeth,<br> Queen of England.<br> A court to worship you.<br> A country to obey you.<br> Poems written celebrating your beauty.<br> Music composed in your honour,<br> and they will be nothing to you.<br> I will mean nothing to you.<br> How could you ever be nothing to me?<br> Robert, you know<br> you are everything to me.<br> All that I am<br> it is you.<br> Benedicta tu in mulieribus<br> et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus.<br> Sancta Maria, Mater Dei<br> ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc...<br> Is she dead?<br> Give it to her.<br> My Lady...<br> The Earl of Sussex is here.<br> The Queen is dead!<br> Long live the Queen!<br> Long live the Queen!<br> This is the Lord's doing<br> and it is marvellous in our eyes.<br> To the north, I present unto you<br> Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen!<br> To the south, I present to you<br> Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen!<br> I crown thee Elizabeth,<br> Queen of England, Ireland and France.<br> God save Your Majesty.<br> Your Majesty has inherited<br> a most parlous and degenerate state.<br> It's threatened from abroad<br> by France and Spain<br> and is weaker in men, monies and riches<br> than I have ever known it.<br> What are you saying?<br> Madam, your treasury is empty.<br> The Navy is run-down,<br> there is no standing army,<br> and no munitions.<br> There is not a fortress<br> that could withstand a single shot.<br> - I have no desire for war, sir.<br> - But that is not the end of it.<br> Here at home there are those<br> who wish Your Majesty ill.<br> Mary of Scots has already<br> laid claim to your throne,<br> and Norfolk...<br> Norfolk covets it relentlessly.<br> Madam, until you marry<br> and produce an heir,<br> you will find no security.<br> That's Sir Christopher Hatton.<br> - There is Sir William Makepeace...<br> - I do not see...<br> - Lord Ensley, Your Majesty.<br> - Delighted.<br> I do not see why a woman<br> need marry at all.<br> Come on, come on!<br> This is Mistress Quickly.<br> You will recall His Excellency<br> the Spanish Ambassador.<br> How could I forget?<br> Excellency.<br> Your Majesty.<br> He's French. You'll have to speak up.<br> Do I know that gentleman?<br> That is Sir Francis Walsingham, Madam.<br> He has returned from exile<br> and I have appointed him<br> to have a care for Your Majesty's person.<br> Ah!<br> Excellency...<br> Majesty...<br> May I present the French Ambassador,<br> His Excellency Monsieur de Foix.<br> Your Excellency.<br> I suppose the French<br> do offer some suitor to her.<br> Naturally.<br> Everything now depends<br> upon the husband that woman takes.<br> King Henry of Anjou<br> sends you brotherly love.<br> He trusts the relationship between<br> our countries may be much improved.<br> That is also my hope.<br> The King expects that you will<br> consider the suit of his brother,<br> the Duke of Anjou.<br> Her Majesty will consider<br> the proposal most carefully.<br> It is unfortunate, however,<br> that the Duke's aunt, Mary of Guise,<br> chooses to garrison Scotland<br> with French troops.<br> Ladies...<br> The marriage of a Queen, Excellency,<br> is born of politics, not childish passion.<br> Your Grace.<br> Walsingham!<br> Welcome to England.<br> - Your Grace is surprised?<br> - No.<br> Only a little disappointed.<br> Play a volta!<br> When may I see you in private?<br> In private?<br> Have you forgot, my Lord?<br> I am Queen now.<br> He's coming.<br> He's coming!<br> My Ladies.<br> My Lord.<br> You blush, Lady Knollys.<br> Are you in love?<br> No, my Lord.<br> Then you should be,<br> or waste all that beauty.<br> Does Her Majesty sleep?<br> Not yet, Sir William.<br> She is... overwrought.<br> Show me Her Majesty's sheets<br> every morning.<br> - I must know all her proper functions.<br> - Proper functions, Sir William?<br> Indeed.<br> Her Majesty's body and person<br> are no longer her own property.<br> They belong to the State.<br> Yes, Sir William.<br> Your Grace.<br> Your Grace, Her Majesty has not risen.<br> Your Grace!<br> Please! Your Grace! Her Majesty<br> is not yet ready to receive visitors.<br> Madam!<br> You had best get up.<br> There is some grave news.<br> My Lady, I'm sorry...<br> Mary of Guise has increased the French<br> garrison in Scotland by 4,000 men.<br> Perhaps more.<br> Madam...<br> I'm afraid the French mean to attack<br> while we are still weak<br> and while Your Majesty's reign<br> is still uncertain.<br> What is your counsel?<br> Madam, we must with all haste<br> raise an army to march upon Scotland.<br> Can... can...?<br> Can we not send emissaries?<br> There is no time for that!<br> As Queen we look to you for action,<br> unless you are content to wait for the<br> French to send more reinforcements.<br> Here.<br> Are you all in agreement?<br> I say there has never been a better time<br> to abate the French pride.<br> Arundel?<br> War is a sin,<br> but sometimes a necessary one.<br> Lord Robert, you were appointed to the<br> Council to protect England's interests.<br> Now it appears<br> you do not have the stomach for it.<br> I am in agreement, Your Grace,<br> if Your Majesty's throne is at risk.<br> - What say you, Walsingham?<br> - Your Majesty!<br> I say a prince should rather<br> be slow to take action<br> and should watch that he does not<br> come to be afraid of his own shadow.<br> You are not, Sir Francis,<br> a member of Council,<br> nor are you in the majority.<br> I do not like wars.<br> They have uncertain outcomes.<br> Go back to England,<br> and take this to your Queen.<br> - Where are my councillors?<br> - I know not, Madam.<br> - Where is Lord Robert?<br> - Lord Robert, Madam, has gone hunting.<br> Leave me.<br> Go! Go!<br> I regret to inform Your Majesty<br> of our miserable defeat in Scotland.<br> The Bishops still demand<br> Your Majesty's removal.<br> They find support in every quarter.<br> Alas, Madam,<br> we are come already to catastrophe.<br> How dare you come into my presence!<br> Why do you follow me here?<br> It is my business<br> to protect Your Majesty<br> against all things.<br> I do not need protection.<br> I need to be left alone!<br> Majesty...<br> They should never have been<br> sent to Scotland.<br> My father would not have made<br> such a mistake.<br> I have been proved unfit to rule.<br> That is what you all think,<br> is it not, Walsingham?<br> It is not for me to judge you.<br> Why did they send children! Why<br> did they not send proper reinforcements!<br> The Bishops would not let them.<br> They spoke against it in the pulpits.<br> Then... they are speaking<br> against their Queen.<br> Madam, the Bishops are against you<br> and have no fear of you.<br> They do not expect you to survive.<br> My Lord! The Queen!<br> Where have you been?<br> You were not at Court.<br> Majesty, Monsieur de Foix.<br> Mary of Guise, Ma'am,<br> promises to make no further threat<br> against Your Majesty, but<br> on one condition.<br> What condition?<br> That Your Majesty considers the proposal<br> of her nephew the Duke of Anjou.<br> The Duke is most eager<br> to meet Your Majesty.<br> He has heard a great deal of your beauty.<br> For the love of God, Madam, let not<br> the care of your diseased estate<br> hang in the balance any longer.<br> In marriage,<br> and in the production of an heir,<br> lies your only surety.<br> The Duke is also most... handsome.<br> Very well.<br> Invite the Duke of Anjou.<br> We shall see him in the flesh.<br> Robert!<br> The Duke will not take kindly<br> to a rival for his suit.<br> He is a traitor,<br> and his father before him.<br> Lord Robert's head<br> will end up on a spike,<br> not on the pillow of a Queen.<br> Must you leave?<br> I would not miss this for the world.<br> Today I shall watch the fall<br> of that heretic girl.<br> I have been placed here<br> as your sov...<br> I am your sovereign.<br> I have been placed here...<br> I...<br> God has... God has placed me here...<br> I am your anointed sovereign...<br> I am your Queen...<br> And like my father I mean to rule.<br> There is one thing higher than royalty,<br> my Lords, and that<br> is religion.<br> I pass this... I pass this Act of...<br> I ask you to pa... I...<br> I ask you to pass this Act of Uniformity.<br> Not for myself. For my people.<br> They're my people...<br> There is one God. We have<br> a common... There is one God.<br> This is for my people.<br> My people are my care.<br> The only care.<br> My Lords, your votes are nothing<br> without my consent.<br> If there is no uniformity<br> of religious belief here<br> then there can only be fragmentation.<br> Disputes and quarrels.<br> Surely, my Lords, it is better<br> to have a single Church of England.<br> A single Church of England!<br> With a common prayer book.<br> And... and a...<br> And... a common purpose.<br> I ask you to pass<br> this Act of Uniformity<br> not... not for myself<br> but for my people<br> who are my only care.<br> Madam, by this Act,<br> you force us to relinquish<br> our allegiance to the Holy Father.<br> Hear, hear!<br> How can I force you, Your Grace?<br> I am a woman.<br> I have no desire<br> to make windows into men's souls.<br> I simply ask<br> can any man, in truth,<br> serve two masters<br> and be faithful to both?<br> Madam, this is heresy!<br> No, Your Grace, this is<br> common sense.<br> Which is a most English virtue.<br> Where is Gardiner?<br> Where are the others?<br> Let us out!<br> Open the door!<br> This is Walsingham's doing.<br> It is the devil's work.<br> It will not serve her in any case.<br> The Bishops will pass no measure<br> which severs us from Rome.<br> Your Majesty would improve<br> all these matters<br> if you would agree to marry.<br> Aye. Marry, Madam.<br> Aye. But marry who, Your Grace?<br> Will you give me some suggestion?<br> For some say France,<br> and others Spain, and<br> and some cannot abide foreigners at all.<br> So I'm not sure how best to please you<br> unless I married one of each.<br> Now Your Majesty does make fun<br> of the sanctity of marriage.<br> I do not think you should lecture me<br> on that, my Lord,<br> since you yourself<br> have been twice divorced.<br> And are now upon your third wife!<br> Each of you must vote<br> according to your conscience.<br> But remember this.<br> In your hands,<br> upon this moment,<br> lies the future happiness of my people,<br> and the peace<br> of this realm.<br> Let that be upon your conscience also.<br> My Lords, the House will divide.<br> Walsingham...!<br> I would know on what authority<br> you have kept us locked up here.<br> Your Graces must forgive me,<br> but you are now free to go.<br> I am sure this infernal work<br> has not saved your bastard Queen.<br> Her Majesty... has won the argument.<br> By what count?<br> By five, Your Grace.<br> Five.<br> You will be damned for this!<br> And I pray God your wretched soul<br> will burn in hell!<br> Report back to me at break of day.<br> Enchant.<br> No!<br> Because... I am Anjou!<br> Yes, I am Anjou, yes! I am Anjou.<br> And I can't wait...<br> Would you like that?<br> Remove your hand.<br> Perhaps, Your Grace,<br> we shall think on it, but...<br> - I am deeply religious.<br> - But I am very religious, too.<br> Very religious, yes!<br> Your Holiness,<br> the priest from England is here.<br> Tell me, my son, what is the news<br> of our brothers and sisters in England?<br> Do they still support the sovereignty<br> of that illegitimate whore?<br> No, Holy Father.<br> They pray ceaselessly that England<br> may be recovered from heresy.<br> Prayers may not be sufficient.<br> I will ask for guidance in this matter.<br> But do not despair.<br> Was it not truly said<br> that the righteous shall inherit the earth?<br> Such piercing eyes!<br> And very indiscreet!<br> My true love has my heart<br> and I have hers.<br> My heart in me<br> keeps her and me in one.<br> My heart in her,<br> her thoughts and senses guide.<br> She loves my heart<br> for once it was her own.<br> I cherish hers<br> because in me it bides.<br> My true love has my heart<br> and I<br> have hers.<br> Marry me.<br> Marry me.<br> On a night such as this<br> could any woman say no?<br> On a night such as this<br> could a Queen say no?<br> Does not a Queen sit under<br> the same stars as any other woman?<br> Monseigneur Alvaro!<br> Monseigneur Alvaro!<br> Tell me,<br> as well as Ambassador,<br> are you not also a Bishop?<br> I am, my Lord.<br> Then you can marry us!<br> Marry you?<br> Perhaps he does not know enough<br> English to perform the ceremony!<br> Alas, Madam, in this matter<br> I can be of no help to you.<br> Madam!<br> The Queen!<br> - Protect the Queen!<br> - Help her!<br> Quickly! Call the Guard!<br> The Queen! The Queen!<br> Look to the Queen!<br> Isabel, see that the ladies are prepared.<br> Isabel, go!<br> Where were you, Sir Francis?<br> I only hope that Her Majesty may be<br> safely delivered from this present danger.<br> Is the bedchamber ready?<br> Be calm, Madam. All is well.<br> I am perfectly well.<br> Please do not fuss.<br> - No-one is to enter.<br> - Yes, Sir William.<br> - Stay in here now, and watch.<br> - Yes, Sir Francis.<br> Sorry, Lord Robert.<br> I said no-one.<br> My Lord,<br> a word.<br> To whose advantage was this?<br> De Foix?<br> No.<br> Not with Anjou in play.<br> Then some... madman?<br> There is always madness, Master Elyot.<br> This was devised.<br> There is reason behind it.<br> Then Alvaro<br> for he has most cause.<br> Yes, but he was present.<br> He is too subtle for that.<br> Would Norfolk?<br> He is not so subtle<br> and has even more cause.<br> Indeed.<br> So then<br> he is not in league with the Spanish.<br> Perhaps. Stay close to him.<br> The Duke has some other game.<br> I must find where he plays.<br> I see it is true that the Queen<br> favours you above all others.<br> But you have many enemies here.<br> Is it not so?<br> That is no concern of yours.<br> It may be.<br> If you would be prepared,<br> in secret, to renounce heresy<br> and embrace the true faith,<br> then you might find<br> many new and powerful friends<br> and<br> keep your Queen.<br> You are most mistaken, Monseigneur,<br> if you think<br> I might so easily be persuaded<br> to act against my conscience,<br> and my love.<br> My Lord,<br> what will a man not do for love?<br> Madam, if only you would heed my advice.<br> I narrowly escaped with my life, sir.<br> I cannot now discuss marriage.<br> Forgive me... the one<br> cannot be separated from the other.<br> - Have I not told you?<br> - Yes, and I am sick of it.<br> This entire conversation is ill-timed.<br> My patience, Sir William, is not infinite.<br> It is a great joy to see<br> Your Majesty is not hurt.<br> It was a terrible affair.<br> The Duke would still<br> know the answer to his suit.<br> You may tell the Duke<br> he shall have his answer shortly.<br> Madam, the point is pressing!<br> The Duke cannot love me so much if<br> he demands my answer so precipitously!<br> Perhaps Her Majesty's heart<br> is already set upon another.<br> Do not presume, monsieur,<br> to know the secrets of my heart.<br> Monsieur de Foix may leave.<br> Please, Excellency...<br> Je vous prie de mes excuses.<br> Secrets, Madam?!<br> You have no secrets!<br> The world knows Lord Robert<br> visits your chambers and you<br> fornicate with him!<br> It's even said you already carry his child!<br> Yes, Sir William, I live my life in the open!<br> I am surrounded by people!<br> I do not understand how so bad<br> a judgement has been formed of me!<br> Madam, you...<br> You cannot marry Lord Robert!<br> He is already married.<br> Here comes our married man.<br> Lord Dudley is not himself today.<br> Lord Dudley's cup runneth over.<br> Imagine being discovered<br> in another woman's bed!<br> Aye, and that it to be his wife's!<br> Lord Robert, we are amazed<br> you show your face at Court.<br> The Queen!<br> Spanish!<br> Spanish!<br> English pirate!<br> English pirate!<br> Is it not enough that English<br> pirates attack and rob our ships<br> but we are to be made fools of<br> in this Court.<br> The King, my master, has become<br> impatient for Your Grace to act.<br> If you will not, then others may.<br> You must reassure His Majesty<br> the time is close at hand.<br> He must not act precipitously.<br> - His Majesty has heard a rumour<br> - The world is filled with rumours.<br> that Your Grace has made contact with<br> Mary of Scots to promote your ambitions.<br> Even that you mean to marry her.<br> Do you suppose me an idiot?<br> Your master is the most powerful man<br> in the world. I would not cross him.<br> Will the Duke not come to dance?<br> Madam, His Grace is indisposed.<br> He has some pains of the stomach.<br> Oh.<br> I am very sorry for it.<br> We wish to give the Duke this ring<br> as a token of our love.<br> - Madam...<br> - No.<br> I shall give it to him myself.<br> Madam, I should not...<br> Sir William.<br> Come along.<br> What!<br> What?<br> What, er... what!<br> You stare, Madam.<br> What is it?<br> Do you see<br> something strange, perhaps?<br> You are wearing a dress, Your Grace.<br> Oh! Yes, I am wearing a dress.<br> Yes, yes, I am wearing a dress!<br> I wear a dress like this,<br> my mother, and you.<br> But I only dress like this when I'm alone,<br> in private, with my friends.<br> Your Grace...<br> Although my affection for you<br> is undiminished<br> I have, after an agonising struggle,<br> determined to sacrifice my own happiness<br> for the welfare of my people.<br> My God!<br> Madam, I will explain.<br> Allez-vous-en, allez!<br> Jouez! Jouez!<br> Madam, is the, er... is the Duke...<br> There will be no more talk of marriage.<br> Lord Robert!<br> Your Majesty?<br> Will you dance?<br> If it please you.<br> Play a volta!<br> Why will you not see me?<br> You must let me explain.<br> Others will take advantage of this.<br> You must not believe<br> what they tell you. They are jealous<br> and envious,<br> because I am nothing to them<br> and everything to you.<br> Do you love her?<br> No, I love you.<br> I have always loved you.<br> I was afraid of losing you<br> because I was not free!<br> For God's sake,<br> you are still my Elizabeth!<br> I am not your Elizabeth!<br> I am no man's Elizabeth!<br> And if you think to rule here<br> you are mistaken!<br> I will have one mistress here<br> and no master!<br> It matters nothing to me.<br> I can live without her<br> most happily.<br> Better than I could live with her.<br> I have no need of her love.<br> Have I not suffered enough already<br> for loving her and showing it?<br> I envy you, my Lord.<br> To love a woman so deeply.<br> Monseigneur... envy no man for that.<br> Such love is hateful.<br> It tears the soul apart. Envy a man<br> who has never known such love.<br> Perhaps there may still be a way<br> to reclaim her affections.<br> Why should I want to?<br> And to save her life.<br> - You jest with me.<br> - No, I do not.<br> For she will be dead soon enough,<br> perhaps even at Norfolk's hand,<br> if you do not help her.<br> How can I help her?<br> She will not even see me.<br> His Holiness has issued the Bull.<br> It deprives Elizabeth, pretended Queen<br> of England, servant of wickedness,<br> of her throne,<br> and declares that her subjects<br> are absolved of their allegiance to her.<br> His Holiness also decrees that any man<br> who should undertake her assassination<br> will be welcomed by angels<br> into the Kingdom of Heaven.<br> Give these letters of blessing<br> and hope to our friends in England.<br> Your Grace.<br> Monseigneur.<br> And Thomas Elyot.<br> You serve your master well, Elyot.<br> As well as I can, in truth.<br> I mean your real master.<br> What's this?<br> What master?<br> Walsingham.<br> The priest is mistaken, my Lord.<br> I am Your Grace's servant,<br> as God is my witness.<br> - Isabel...<br> - Sshh, don't fuss.<br> You should not try them on, Isabel.<br> They are the Queen's dresses.<br> Why not?<br> You're my secret.<br> I am Queen, aren't I?<br> Say you're mine.<br> You're my Elizabeth.<br> Say you're my Elizabeth.<br> I am your Elizabeth.<br> I am your Queen!<br> Ssh...!<br> Sshh...!<br> Kat?<br> Kat!<br> Kat?<br> Who are you?<br> You will declare yourself to me.<br> Madam!<br> Something has happened!<br> You must come quickly!<br> Who was with her?<br> One of the guards found her.<br> He says he saw Lord Robert leave...<br> No, Madam, no.<br> The dress was poisoned.<br> Uncover her.<br> No...! That dress was a gift<br> for me.<br> French silk.<br> Vite! Vite!<br> Sir Francis,<br> you and I must be honest with each other.<br> Your Queen is weak.<br> She has no army,<br> no friends. Only...<br> Comment dit-on...?<br> - Enemies.<br> - Enemies.<br> Mm-hm.<br> What terms can she propose?<br> Madam, Her Majesty was, I believe,<br> too hasty at rejecting<br> the Duke's proposal of marriage.<br> But how can I marry such a woman?<br> Huh?<br> She is frigid!<br> Yes! They even say she is really a man!<br> Forgive my nephew.<br> He speaks when he should not.<br> He is terrible.<br> Ne fais pas l'idiot, Henri.<br> I hear you are a wise man, Sir Francis,<br> and a creature of the world<br> like me.<br> Yes.<br> I have no illusions.<br> I know it is only a matter of time<br> before my Queen is overthrown.<br> Her Majesty rules with the heart,<br> not with the head.<br> I understand.<br> It is hard for a woman to forget her heart.<br> But, er...<br> what of you,<br> Walsingham?<br> A wise man would be careful<br> not to put himself in the way of harm.<br> And how would a wise man do that?<br> He would, as I said, change allegiance.<br> Allegiance?<br> There are but two choices.<br> He would get into bed<br> with either Spain or France.<br> And whose bed<br> would you prefer?<br> Your Majesty, may I speak with you?<br> In private.<br> Speak.<br> You are in the greatest danger.<br> You must believe me.<br> But you have a friend.<br> Someone who can guarantee your safety<br> and your throne.<br> A friend?<br> The King of Spain.<br> Leave us.<br> How would he guarantee it?<br> He would marry you.<br> Only to make an alliance. Nothing more.<br> He would not expect to...<br> He would live in Spain.<br> Why do you do this, Robert?<br> Because I love you.<br> And though you will not see me,<br> I am the only one who would care for you.<br> You love me so much<br> you would have me be your whore?<br> For God's sake, I do this for us.<br> I ask you to save some part of us!<br> Lord Robert, you may make whores of my<br> Ladies but you shall not make one of me.<br> Your Majesty.<br> Get out! Get out!<br> Of course I shall deny it.<br> Your Majesty must publicly dissociate<br> herself from this most bloody act.<br> I never ordered it.<br> Of course, Madam, of course.<br> You must also make conciliatory gestures<br> towards the Spanish.<br> Your dependence upon their goodwill<br> is greater than ever.<br> - I must...<br> - The word "must" is not used to princes.<br> I have followed your advice<br> in all the affairs of my kingdom, but<br> your policies would make England<br> nothing but part of France or Spain.<br> From this moment<br> I am going to follow my own opinion.<br> Forgive me, Madam,<br> but you are only a woman.<br> I may be a woman, Sir William, but<br> if I choose I have the heart of a man!<br> I am my father's daughter.<br> I am not afraid of anything.<br> I...<br> I deeply regret, Madam,<br> if I have caused you such offence<br> though God knows<br> all my advice has only ever been<br> to secure Your Majesty's throne.<br> And I am grateful for it.<br> I have decided to create you<br> Lord Burghley,<br> so you may enjoy your retirement<br> in greater ease.<br> - Madam...<br> - That will be all, Lord Burghley.<br> Majesty...<br> Madam, if I may?<br> A prince should never flinch<br> from being blamed<br> for acts of ruthlessness which are<br> necessary for safeguarding the State<br> and their own person.<br> You must take these things so much<br> to heart that you do not fear to strike<br> even the very nearest that you have<br> if they be implicated.<br> It has been made known to me<br> there is a priest abroad in the land,<br> carrying letters from Rome<br> to those who mean to harm you.<br> Norfolk's power in Court is growing.<br> It is said that he and his foreign allies<br> are raising an army<br> to outnumber your own.<br> If Your Majesty does not act soon<br> then he will.<br> Find the priest,<br> and those who harbour him.<br> Right, search every room!<br> You two, upstairs!<br> Where is Lord Arundel?<br> He's not here, sir.<br> Do you know where your father is?<br> You were carrying letters from the Pope.<br> To whom were you told to give them?<br> Tell me,<br> what is God to you?<br> Has He abandoned you?<br> Is He such a worldly God that<br> He must play at politics and conspiracy?<br> Is He not divine?<br> Tell me the truth, as if you were<br> face to face with Him now.<br> I am a patient man, Father.<br> Sussex,<br> Gardiner,<br> Arundel.<br> A man will confess to anything<br> under torture.<br> And Lord Robert Dudley,<br> Earl of Leicester.<br> Madam, this document was also found<br> among the priest's possessions.<br> From His Holiness the Pope<br> to His Grace the Duke of Norfolk.<br> "To legitimise your claim to the throne<br> of England, His Holiness proposes<br> "Your Grace should take as your bride<br> Mary, Queen of Scots,<br> and overthrow Elizabeth..."<br> The illegitimate and heretical whore<br> who now sits upon the throne.<br> All Norfolk need do is sign this paper,<br> and treason will have been committed.<br> Then let him sign it.<br> And let it all be done.<br> In the future,<br> when England is safe again and faithful,<br> they will thank me for this act<br> and forget the manner of it.<br> Is it not true?<br> Deliver this most carefully.<br> What is the meaning of this?<br> Your Grace is arrested.<br> You must go with these men to the Tower.<br> I must do nothing by your orders.<br> I am Norfolk.<br> You were Norfolk.<br> The dead have no titles.<br> You were the most powerful man<br> in England<br> and could have been greater still<br> but you had not the courage to be loyal.<br> Only the conviction of your own vanity.<br> I think, Walsingham, a man's courage<br> is in the manner of his death.<br> I am content to die for my beliefs.<br> So cut off my head<br> and make me a martyr.<br> The people will always remember it.<br> No...<br> They will forget.<br> Your Majesty<br> knows that<br> I did it only for my faith.<br> Nothing more.<br> All your many kindnesses<br> are remembered.<br> You must not think<br> we care not for your children.<br> Your Majesty is merciful and forgiving.<br> What kept you, Walsingham?<br> I have been waiting.<br> Your Majesty...<br> They are all gone to the Tower.<br> Your friends.<br> Tell me,<br> how should I serve thee, Robert?<br> My course is run.<br> Just tell me why.<br> Why?<br> Madam,<br> is it not plain enough to you?<br> It is no easy thing to be loved<br> by the Queen.<br> It would corrupt the soul of any man.<br> Now, for God's sake, kill me.<br> No...<br> I think rather to let you live.<br> Madam, that is not wise.<br> Lord Robert has committed treason.<br> - He must be made example of.<br> - And I will make an example of him.<br> He shall be kept alive<br> to always remind me<br> of how close I came to danger.<br> I have rid England of her enemies.<br> What do I do now?<br> Am I to be made of stone?<br> Must I be touched by nothing?<br> Aye, Madam, to reign supreme.<br> All men need something greater than<br> themselves to look up to and worship.<br> They must be able to touch the divine<br> here on earth.<br> She had such power over men's hearts.<br> They died for her.<br> They have found nothing to replace her.<br> You will be damned for this!<br> Tonight I think I die.<br> Speak up!<br> Kat...<br> I have become a virgin.<br> Observe, Lord Burghley.<br> I am married<br> to England.<br>
