                        (laughter)<br> So, anyway... anyway,<br> this guy comes home, you see,<br> and he finds his wife with his best friend.<br> And the husband says<br> "Harry, how could you do this?"<br> And the wife, she says "Why should you<br> complain? Harry didn't do it to you!"<br> - What did I tell you? Isn't he a card?<br> - Class. Real class.<br> With his gift of the gab<br> he could go places.<br> Hey, pal, you oughta quit<br> that punk job of yours.<br> - Why don't you join a sales outfit?<br> - It's no use, boys.<br> Every time I'm in town, I ask him to go<br> on the road for our company. Right, pal?<br> Sure, Ed, sure. Listen, fellas, listen.<br> Two dames at a bar. One dame says to<br> another "If I don't get to bed pretty soon,<br> I'm goin' home and go to sleep!"<br> Would you make it a merry Christmas<br> for some poor orphan?<br> Here you are, lady.<br> That oughtn't to be allowed<br> in a place like this.<br> - Religion don't belong in a speakeasy.<br> - I know it's Christmas, but...<br> Mac, wait a minute. Excuse me,<br> Sister. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> Don't tell me we're gonna let<br> these angels of mercy<br> go away from here<br> empty-handed on Christmas Eve.<br> This joint is the home<br> of fine bourbon and fast women,<br> and we need plenty of religion<br> to keep 'em both in line. So, come on.<br> Get it up, now. Come on. Oh, come on.<br> A little action here. What's the matter?<br> Oh.<br> Hey!<br> Hey, Lord? Can you hear me<br> up there, Jesus?<br> You didn't think we'd forget<br> your birthday, did you?<br> There you are, Jesus. And if I had<br> any more, you'd be welcome to it.<br> - Thank you, brother.<br> - (laughter)<br> The Bible says "Never let your left hand<br> know what your right hand is doing. "<br> What's your beef, mister?<br> You ashamed of bein' a Christian?<br> I see. You think religion is for suckers<br> and easy marks and mollycoddles, huh?<br> You think Jesus was some kind<br> of a sissy, eh? Let me tell you,<br> Jesus wouldn't be afraid to walk in here<br> or any speakeasy to preach the gospel.<br> Jesus had guts! He wasn't afraid<br> of the whole Roman army.<br> Think that quarterback's<br> hot stuff? Well, let me tell you,<br> Jesus would have made the best little<br> all-American quarterback in history.<br> Jesus was a real fighter. The best little<br> scrapper, pound for pound, you ever saw.<br> And why, gentlemen? Love, gentlemen.<br> Jesus had love in both fists.<br> And what is love?<br> Love is the mornin' and the evenin' star<br> that shines on the cradle of the babe.<br> Hey, sinners!<br> Love is the inspiration<br> of poets and philosophers.<br> Love is the voice of music.<br> I'm talkin' about divine love,<br> not carnal love.<br> - That was a beautiful sermon, Parson.<br> - (laughter)<br> - Beautiful.<br> - Thank you, sister.<br> - I gotta get home to the little woman.<br> - Here you are, Sister.<br> Merry Christmas. Thank the Lord,<br> Sister. Thank the Lord.<br> - Gotta go. Gotta catch a rattler.<br> - Me too.<br> Time to take up a little female<br> companionship. Wait a minute.<br> That's a swell preacher act you got, pal.<br> I gotta catch a rattler myself. Ed,<br> we still got the whole night ahead of us.<br> Whatever you do, never lose<br> that little black address book.<br> Merry Christmas!<br> Mr. Gantry?<br> And a merry Christmas to you too, sir.<br> You'll have to chalk it up.<br> The rest of these drinks, too.<br> Charity.<br> I oughta get myself a tambourine.<br> That's the trouble with this stinking world.<br> Nobody loves nobody.<br> Mac... the lady's glass is empty.<br> (phone rings)<br> (knocking at door)<br> (groans)<br> OK.<br> - Long-distance phone call.<br> - What time is it?<br> The phone call you made<br> to Mrs. Gantry last night?<br> Oh. Yeah, thanks.<br> - Merry Christmas, Mr. Gantry.<br> - You too.<br> And a happy New Year, Mr. Gantry.<br> Well, I'll take...<br> I'll take care of you downstairs.<br> Get my bags out now.<br> Hello? Hello?<br> (woman) Ready with your call, Mr. Gantry<br> Hello? Oh, hello, Mom. Merry Christmas.<br> Me, Elm!<br> Just a sec, Mom.<br> I just got back from church myself.<br> I prayed for you too.<br> How'd you like my present?<br> You sure? Gee, that's funny.<br> Well, maybe it got held up<br> in the holiday rush.<br> I just called up to wish you merry<br> Christmas, that's all, to tell you I love you.<br> Don't start crying.<br> Ma...<br> I know I promised, but I couldn't get away.<br> I've been busy. Yeah, business.<br> Guaranteed and delivered. I'll be home<br> next Easter. My absolute promise.<br> Ma, don't cry.<br> Ma, I gotta go. I really gotta go, Ma.<br> I gotta catch a train.<br> Sure. Sure. I'll talk to you. Take care.<br> Bye.<br> (train whistle)<br> (train whistle)<br> (choir singing "I'm On My Way")<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Off to Canaan land<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Off to Canaan land<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Glory, hallelujah<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Well, I'm on my way<br> # Off to Canaan land<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Off to Canaan land<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Off to Canaan land<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Glory, hallelujah<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Had a mighty hard time<br> # But I'm on my way<br> # Had a mighty hard time<br> # But I'm on my way<br> # It's a mighty hard climb<br> # But I'm on my way<br> # On my way<br> # Glory, hallelujah<br> # I'm on my way<br> # All along the way<br> # Satan lies a-waitin'<br> # Every night and day<br> # Satan lies a-waitin'<br> # Hear me shout and say<br> # Get behind me, Satan<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Glory, hallelujah<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Fight the devil and pray<br> # Take another step higher<br> # Fight the devil and pray<br> # Lord, I want to climb higher<br> # Chase the devil away<br> # Lord, I'm caught in his fire<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Glory, hallelujah<br> # I'm on my way<br> # Lord, I'm on my way<br> # Lord, I'm on my way<br> # Lord, Lord<br> # Lord, I'm on my way<br> # I'm on my way<br> - You'd better get at this while it's still hot.<br> - Thank you, brother.<br> Would you look at this filthy magazine,<br> Reverend? Shameful. Shameful.<br> Burn, ye naked Jezebel, burn.<br> Like a blindin' flash.<br> "Suddenly there shined round<br> about him a light from heaven,<br> - and he heard a voice say unto him... "<br> - "Saul. Saul. "<br> - "Why persecutest thou me?"<br> - Saul of Tarsus.<br> Acts, chapter nine.<br> "And straightaway he preached.<br> Christ is the son of God. "<br> - "And all who heard him were amazed. "<br> - "Amazed. "<br> Excuse me, but you sound<br> like a preacher.<br> - Great black-eyed peas, Reverend. Great.<br> - If you'll be needing a place to sleep...<br> Thank you kindly, but as soon as<br> I haul these ashes, I'll be on my way.<br> - Well, God be with you, brother.<br> - Put in a good word for me, brother.<br> - Back again, Mr. Gantry?<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> Come spring, come the drummer man.<br> Good morning, good morning,<br> good morning - and a hot morning it is.<br> Sam, as the blind man said<br> to the elephant, long time no see.<br> Last March.<br> I got a great new item for you -<br> an electric toaster that pops.<br> - No.<br> - An egg beater that's a lulu.<br> No sale.<br> This little devil's<br> gonna clean up America.<br> You sold me nine of them<br> vacuum cleaners last year.<br> There they are, all nine of 'em.<br> Well, no harm done. How about<br> a free snort on the house?<br> (laughs) That's how you<br> stuck me the last time.<br> Ever hear the one about the missionary,<br> the cannibal and the chorus girl?<br> This Sister Sharon -<br> she any good at preachin'?<br> I don't know. I don't go<br> to prayer meetings. I mean...<br> unless business is bad<br> or I get sick. Times like that.<br> Say, how about the missionary and<br> the cannibals and the chorus girl, hm?<br> There she was in the wildest jungles<br> of Borneo, without a stitch on,<br> except her dancin' shoes<br> and her pith helmet.<br> Can I speak to Mrs. Wilson,<br> please? Thank you.<br> Hello? Hello, Sally?<br> Me. Elmer. Who do you think?<br> Swell, just swell. How's every<br> little thing with you, honey?<br> - Baby, I just got into town.<br> - (knocking at door)<br> Hold it a sec, Sal. Come in.<br> - How did we do?<br> - Ran out of the money in both races.<br> Sally? How about tonight, baby?<br> What time does your husband get home?<br> But, honey, I won't be here tomorrow.<br> Well, look, can you come over<br> for an hour? A half an hour, huh?<br> Oh.<br> Sure, Sal. Sure I understand.<br> Think nothin' of it, honey. I'll catch<br> you next time around. Bye, now.<br> - Did you get the bottle?<br> - Nah.<br> You know bootleggers.<br> They do a cash business.<br> - Toss you. Double or nothin'.<br> - No. You're too lucky, Mr. Gantry.<br> - Thank you. Anything else I can do?<br> - Thanks, kid.<br> (woman)? Just now,<br> your doubting give o'er<br> # Just now, reject Him no more<br> # Just now, throw open the door<br> # Let Jesus come into your heart<br> # Lay we every burden down<br> # Grace our spirits will deliver<br> # And provide a robe and crown<br> # Yes, we'll gather at the river<br> # The beautiful, the beautiful river<br> # Gather with the saints at the river<br> # That flows by the throne of God<br> # Yes, we'll gather at the river<br> # The beautiful, the beautiful river<br> # Gather with the saints at the river<br> # That flows by the throne of God<br> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.<br> Welcome to the house of God.<br> (fanfare)<br> # Mine eyes have seen the glory<br> of the coming of the Lord<br> # He is trampling out the vintage<br> where the grapes of wrath are stored<br> # He hath loosed the fateful lightning<br> of His terrible swift sword<br> # His truth is marching on<br> # Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br> # Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br> # Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br> # His truth is marching on<br> # Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br> # Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br> # Glory, glory, hallelujah!<br> # His truth is marching on<br> Oh, my dear, beautiful people.<br> When I arrived here and I saw<br> your gracious countryside,<br> I said to myself "I won't.<br> I just won't be cooped up<br> with a lot of stodgy old ministers<br> discussing hell and damnation!"<br> So I sneaked out,<br> and I've been doing what most<br> of you have been doing - farming.<br> Milking the cows, lying in the clover,<br> and letting the joy of God's nature<br> flow into my heart.<br> And here's the proof<br> there's a happy, joyful God,<br> a bountiful God, a generous God.<br> Milk!<br> Here, Reverend. The Lord's nectar.<br> And pass it along to those<br> dear newspaper reporters<br> so they can wash out the taste of whisky.<br> Tonight...<br> tonight I feel gloriously happy,<br> and I want you to feel happy too.<br> We're gonna sing together,<br> laugh together, rejoice together<br> like carefree children of a happy God.<br> We're going to rejoice that inside<br> of us lives the veritable spirit<br> of the everlasting<br> redeeming Christ, Jesus.<br> - Hallelujah!<br> - Praise the Lord!<br> Bill, see how many of those dear people<br> can match God's bountiful gift<br> with their own offerings.<br> You darlings can't make milk,<br> and God just won't make money.<br> # Stand up, stand up for Jesus<br> # Ye soldiers of the cross<br> # Lift high His royal banner<br> No preaching tonight. No sermonising.<br> No sad faces or tears, just happiness.<br> Tomorrow...<br> tomorrow is the last night<br> of our revival here,<br> but when I leave,<br> you're going to carry on my work.<br> You're all of you evangelists,<br> every blessed one of you.<br> Shake hands with the person on your<br> right. Go on! Ask them if they're saved.<br> Won't you shake hands for Jesus?<br> Bless you, brother.<br> Sing, everybody! Sing his praises!<br> - Sister Falconer!<br> - Won't you find happiness in Jesus?<br> It's happiness to hear your wondrous<br> message. Can I have a moment?<br> Excuse me, please. Excuse me.<br> - Excuse me, please.<br> - Thank you, brother.<br> Oh, uh, yes... Sorry. No change.<br> Thank you.<br> (car horn)<br> I picked some flowers for you.<br> Sister, my son saw the Virgin Mother<br> on the roof last night after your sermon.<br> Can you spare me an hour?<br> I simply can't. Aren't our counsellors<br> taking care of you? Sister Rachel?<br> Sister Rachel, see what you can do. Every<br> one of these lovely people is important.<br> - May I have your names, please?<br> - I must congratulate you again.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I'm a preacher.<br> - I know how inspired you must've been.<br> - What church?<br> What church? Well, uh, at present,<br> I don't exactly have a church, but...<br> What is it this time, brother?<br> Booze or women?<br> Why, Sister Falconer. Me?<br> Whichever one it is,<br> you have my blessing. Jim?<br> - Uh, Sister, I, uh...<br> - Nice try, brother.<br> - Will prayer cure diabetes?<br> - Would you give me your address?<br> - Sister?<br> - Just a moment.<br> - What denomination?<br> - I must talk to you.<br> - If you'll just leave your name.<br> - I have an important message for you.<br> A message? From Sister Falconer?<br> - I heard you sing last night.<br> - Oh?<br> I know flattery don't mean much<br> to a talented person like you,<br> but when you sang that<br> inspiring song "Beulah Land",<br> it made me realise that music<br> is the voice of love.<br> - Oh.<br> - And what is love?<br> Love is the morning and the evening star.<br> America. A land of great opportunity.<br> Take me. I've been with the Central<br> States Appliance Company a year.<br> I'm their crack salesman already. They<br> wanna make me a partner. It's a great life.<br> Folks in 14 states know me by my<br> first name. Makes a fella feel humble.<br> - Would you like to start with a cocktail?<br> - A cocktail in the middle of the day?<br> Don't you know that drinkin' is sinful<br> and against the principles of Coolidge?<br> I meant shrimp cocktail.<br> Just bring us some of<br> Mother's apple pie and coffee.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Tell me, when did you<br> first start servin' God?<br> Two years ago. In Cato, Missouri. Sister<br> Sharon's gospel singer got hurt in a riot.<br> A riot? In a Christian town like...<br> What was the name?<br> Cato.<br> Cato, Missouri. Yes, some roughnecks<br> started yellin' and screamin' and hollerin'.<br> During the services?<br> Sister Sharon yelled to a farmer on our<br> side "Hit him one for the Lord, brother!"<br> Apple pie. They ought to write<br> a song about apple pie.<br> A gospel song. And you should sing it.<br> (whistle blows)<br> (conductor) All aboard!<br> - Godspeed the good work, Sister!<br> - Good luck, Sister Sharon!<br> Godspeed, Sister Sharon! Good luck!<br> Shara?<br> Our advance man in Lincoln, Nebraska,<br> got drunk, and he's disappeared.<br> No more business tonight.<br> - Thank heavens. When I didn't see you...<br> - Thinkin' about you every second.<br> The fire department in Lincoln say<br> that we can't put up a tent our size.<br> - The church committee are bickering...<br> - Please, Bill.<br> The gentleman with Sister Falconer.<br> - Mr. Morgan?<br> - Yes.<br> Tell him Mr. Lefferts would like to see him<br> out back on the observation platform.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Mr. Lefferts? My name is Gantry.<br> Congratulations.<br> - Sorry I woke you up.<br> - Then why did you do it?<br> Oh, I recognised you.<br> I had to congratulate you on those<br> articles you wrote about evolution.<br> Not only scarifyin' and sensational,<br> but very funny.<br> Tell me somethin', Jim boy. I know<br> you got one of them Pulitzer prizes,<br> but you don't really believe in<br> all that evolution junk, now do you?<br> - Devoutly.<br> - Then you must believe<br> - that God himself is a gorilla.<br> - How did you arrive at that conclusion?<br> It says in the Bible<br> "God created man in his own image. "<br> Sister Sharon -<br> she's pretty important news, eh?<br> What's your interest in her?<br> - Can I be frank with you?<br> - Try.<br> - She fascinates me.<br> - You'll have to get in line.<br> You also have to get over<br> a hurdle first, name of Bill Morgan.<br> Say, I almost forgot. He's comin' out<br> to see you, right about now.<br> He's got some secret information.<br> Thanks a lot, Jim boy. Thanks a lot.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yes, fine. I was just wondering...<br> Later, honey.<br> I'm sorry, this seat is taken.<br> Even the Lord never turned<br> his back on a sinner.<br> I am not the Lord, but I am tired.<br> Now, will you please go away?<br> You weren't so tired and all of life<br> two years ago in Cato, Missouri.<br> - That's where we met.<br> - Met?<br> Yes. On a Friday night, it was.<br> Remember? Remember the riot?<br> Some roughnecks got to whoopin'<br> and hollerin' and fightin', and you yelled<br> - "Hit him one for the Lord!"<br> - That's what I said.<br> And that's exactly what I did.<br> I busted him one for the Lord.<br> Oh, it was a lovely fight!<br> When I saw you in Cato, I thought I was<br> seein' an angel, and you haven't changed.<br> - A very tired angel.<br> - It's no wonder,<br> givin' everybody else hope and courage,<br> nobody to lean on yourself.<br> I suppose this is a generous offer<br> to let me lean on you.<br> I wouldn't have the nerve, Sister.<br> - Yesterday, Mr...<br> - Gantry.<br> . . you said you were a preacher.<br> Well, uh, practically, yes. Uh, you see,<br> the semester I was to be ordained...<br> They kicked you out of college.<br> Well, it was a... a tragedy, kind of.<br> A girl.<br> Yeah. A girl.<br> A girl named Lulu Bains.<br> - Does she work for you, or you for her?<br> - We work together.<br> Would it be unethical to ask just what<br> you'll write about Sister Sharon?<br> - It would.<br> - Oh?<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - She's brilliant.<br> "Inspired" is a more appropriate word.<br> - It means "touched by the hand of God".<br> - Precisely.<br> Now, get the picture.<br> It's Christmas Eve. God's pure snow<br> driftin' down, and joy in the air.<br> I enter the Schoenheim church<br> late at night to pray for guidance.<br> And what do I find, right behind the altar?<br> Lulu Bains, my betrothed, my bride-to-be,<br> half-naked, locked in the arms of<br> her lover, a cardsharp from Chicago.<br> A couple of years later he was bumped<br> off in a gang war, God rest his soul.<br> Well, that's it, I guess.<br> I lost all interest in religion.<br> But when I saw you,<br> it was like a call from beyond.<br> Could I see you again?<br> Have breakfast with me?<br> What's your hotel room number<br> in Lincoln, hm? Tell me.<br> You're so completely... so outrageous.<br> I... I think I like you.<br> I guess I've been around<br> sanctimonious folks too long.<br> You're amusing,<br> and you smell like a real man.<br> Yes, I'll meet you by my tent.<br> That's where I breakfast. Good night.<br> - Oh, but, Sister...<br> - Oh, this time I mean it.<br> Pleasant dreams.<br> Evening, Brother Morgan. Oh, I wouldn't<br> bother her now. She's resting, poor child.<br> The wind will come from there, so keep<br> the centre poles where you've got them.<br> That way the canvas won't snap<br> and crackle all through the sermon.<br> Here they come.<br> Morning, Sister! Jim boy!<br> A lovely morning it is.<br> - Good morning.<br> - I woke with a terrific idea.<br> Later. Good morning, Captain.<br> - You can't erect that tent here, ma'am.<br> - Why not?<br> - Fire laws.<br> - Nonsense.<br> No, ma'am. No nonsense<br> at all. No, ma'am.<br> "Ma'am" is a contraction for "madam".<br> I am not a madam,<br> a calibre of woman I'm sure you<br> know well and do business with.<br> How many have been put out<br> of business by fire laws?<br> - Your tent holds over 1,000 people...<br> - Captain, this is Mr. Lefferts,<br> - a reporter for the Zenith Times-DisPatch<br> - Zenith? Welcome. This is Fire Chief...<br> Isn't it a fact, Mr. Lefferts, that the whisky<br> big shots want me closed down?<br> They certainly don't think<br> you do their business any good.<br> Know why? I'm not afraid to fight whisky<br> and repeal with police help or without it.<br> - If you're accusing me of not...<br> - I am. Do you enforce prohibition?<br> I certainly do.<br> How many speakeasies could you<br> take the captain to in his home town?<br> - Without a membership card? 50.<br> - (Sharon) Fire laws!<br> Do you see any of my workmen smoking?<br> Do you mind? This might start a fire.<br> - If they don't smoke inside...<br> - You're welcome to see tonight.<br> A little bit of salvation<br> will do you both some good.<br> Sister Sharon! Never did I ever see<br> anybody handle the cops the way you did.<br> All right. What's this terrific idea<br> you woke up with?<br> Yes, well... How would it be if I addressed<br> your meetin' as a saved businessman?<br> I could talk on the hard,<br> practical dollars-and-cents value<br> of Christ in commerce.<br> Tom, slacken off that rope. It's too tight.<br> By the way, what is<br> your business? Hold-ups?<br> You're a card. I sell<br> for Central Appliances.<br> - Don't you like your job?<br> - Why, sure. It's a great life.<br> I'm their crack salesman. Only last month<br> they wanted to make me a junior partner.<br> Would you believe that people in 14 states<br> call me by my first name? Elmer.<br> No use kiddin' you, is there?<br> It's no life at all.<br> Filthy, dreary hotel rooms.<br> Always chasin' trains.<br> Always tellin' dirty stories<br> to keep the buyers laughin'.<br> Always the pint bottle<br> to prove you're a sport.<br> That kind of fella's no success at all.<br> He's just a tramp in a silk shirt.<br> Well...<br> I could tell the sinners<br> I'm a... I'm a salesman, just like that.<br> I come into one of them...<br> miserable hotel rooms.<br> I'm discouraged.<br> I got no sales to chalk up.<br> Nothin' to read. I'm lonely.<br> I'm just dyin' for a drink. Some of them<br> salesmen drink somethin' terrible.<br> And I reach my hand into<br> a dresser drawer... and what do I find?<br> A Gideon Bible. That's what I find.<br> Yes. Yes, go on.<br> I reached my hand into a dresser drawer,<br> and I found a Gideon Bible.<br> (man) Louder!<br> I found a Gideon Bible.<br> I was so lonely and miserable,<br> I might as well have been in hell.<br> I was in hell. I knew<br> all the salesman's tricks.<br> Why wasn't I rich?<br> Why wasn't I successful?<br> I opened the Bible,<br> and I read the 18th Psalm.<br> "The Lord is my rock and my fortress. "<br> "The Lord is my fortress. "<br> Do you hear that? The Lord.<br> - Praise the Lord!<br> - The Lord is my rock!<br> The next mornin'<br> I walked into a general store.<br> "What are you sellin' today?<br> Gold-plated vacuum cleaners?"<br> "No, sir. You can get better vacuum<br> cleaners at Sears and Roebuck,<br> and you can get 'em cheaper, but<br> you can't beat our electric toasters. "<br> He sat down and wrote me<br> the biggest order of the year.<br> (man) Hallelujah!<br> Can you hear me, Lord? Thank you, Lord.<br> I didn't make that sale, Lord.<br> You did. Thank you.<br> (man) Hallelujah!<br> And when I told my pals...<br> when I told my pals I was<br> comin' to Jesus, they laughed.<br> But Sister Falconer didn't laugh.<br> She said "Go ahead, brother.<br> Give 'em hell. "<br> I'm going to give you<br> all the hell in the Bible,<br> and if you don't like it, fix it up with<br> the Lord because the Lord put it there.<br> Listen to me, sinners.<br> Listen to me, sinners.<br> You can't pray to kingdom come<br> and play bridge or poker. And, Mother,<br> you can't say your psalms and look<br> at God through the bottom of a beer mug.<br> And you, brother,<br> you can't go to church on Sunday<br> and cheat at business on Monday.<br> We're comin' back to you, God. We're<br> comin' back to the old-time religion!<br> And what is religion?<br> What is religion?<br> Religion is love.<br> And love is the morning<br> and the evening star.<br> Love, the eternal glorious musicmaker.<br> Love! Not the carnal love,<br> but the divine love.<br> And where does this great love<br> come from? It comes direct from God!<br> I admit I'm not smart like some of them...<br> some of them smart-alecky professors,<br> wise-guy writers and agitators.<br> I know nothing of theosophy, philosophy,<br> psychology, ideology or any other ology.<br> But I know this.<br> With Christ, you're saved,<br> and without him, you're lost.<br> And how do I know<br> there's a merciful God?<br> Because I've seen the devil<br> plenty of times!<br> Any punk ball player<br> can make a slide like that.<br> But how many folks have got the guts<br> to play ball on God's team?<br> And listen to this. The captain<br> of that team is Jesus Christ himself.<br> So, come on, man, woman, child.<br> Who'll be the first<br> to shake hands for Jesus?<br> Come on, now! Everyone!<br> Are you gonna make me beg and beg<br> when I'm offerin' you my Jesus?<br> Did the Saviour die in vain?<br> Did he suffer on the cross for nothin'?<br> Argh! My God, I can't stand it!<br> Oh, my God, no! Not any more!<br> Sinner, I'll fight you every day in the week<br> for God and twice on Sundays!<br> Help me. Brother Gantry, save me.<br> I sin every day!<br> Tell me what to do, please.<br> Tell me what to do!<br> - "Lifeline. "<br> - (band plays and people sing)<br> # Throw out the lifeline<br> # Somebody's drifting away<br> # Throw out the lifeline<br> # Throw out the lifeline<br> Bless you for bringing us<br> such a wonderful man.<br> - Sister Sharon.<br> - Bless you, Brother Gantry.<br> You've changed my whole life.<br> You're such a good man.<br> - This light supposed to be kept burnin'?<br> - Yep.<br> Sometimes folks come just to touch<br> where Sister Sharon stands.<br> Say, I heard you talk tonight.<br> - How'd you like it?<br> - Mister, I've been converted five times.<br> Billy Sunday, Reverend Biederwolf, Gypsy<br> Smith, and twice by Sister Falconer.<br> I get terrible drunk,<br> and then I get good and saved.<br> Both of them done me a powerful lot<br> of good - gettin' drunk, and gettin' saved.<br> Well, good night.<br> Are you praying, or planning to take over?<br> Shara!<br> Did I do all right?<br> I mean, did I do all right for you?<br> Yes, you were fine. Really fine.<br> I cried like everybody else.<br> No, but... Tell me the truth, please.<br> That's a truth of some kind.<br> - Morgan thought you were vulgar.<br> - Do you?<br> - Think I'm vulgar?<br> - Yes.<br> - But you like me.<br> - Yes.<br> - Very much.<br> - Not very much.<br> Shara.<br> Forgive me, Sharon.<br> - You've got me plumb hypnotised.<br> - No, you're just hungry, that's all.<br> But I can hypnotise, because<br> God chose me to do his work.<br> - Sure, me too.<br> - No.<br> I chose you. The big difference<br> between you and me is that I believe.<br> I really believe.<br> - You'd like to join us, wouldn't you?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Report at nine. We'll discuss salaries...<br> - I got swell ideas for promotions.<br> - Radio, the third ear of the human race...<br> - You smoke, don't you?<br> - Well...<br> - I can smell it. Will you stop it altogether?<br> - Well, yes...<br> - The drinking, too?<br> - Oh, sure. If that's what you want, I...<br> - It is.<br> Good night.<br> Evening, Brother Gantry.<br> Jim boy! Say, all the time Shara and me -<br> uh, Sister Falconer and me...<br> Yep. Sitting right over there.<br> - You're not gonna write about this?<br> - Boy kisses girl? Hell, that's not news.<br> You're slipping, brother. You know,<br> when you first hooked me on that train,<br> I thought you were a friendly,<br> likeable, self-respecting first-class bum.<br> And now... now look at you.<br> Where'd you get your style?<br> - Just let her rip, I guess.<br> - I've heard powerful Bible-wallopers,<br> but you not only put the fear of God<br> into them, you scared the hell out of 'em.<br> And the way you strung certain words<br> together - "America, home, mother".<br> "Heaven, hell... Love, hate, sin".<br> You know, it's a funny thing, Jim.<br> I get up here and I... I see them out there.<br> Next thing you know,<br> I'm howlin', they're moanin'.<br> It's like a mighty spirit<br> movin' inside of me.<br> Words and ideas come pourin' out<br> like... like riled-up strangers.<br> I feel so powerful and full of love,<br> I'm about to explode.<br> I do explode.<br> And then I just about love everybody<br> Especially the girls.<br> Yes, this is where I belong, all right.<br> Right here, in religion.<br> Even if it is a tent.<br> Every circus needs a clown,<br> Brother Gantry.<br> And you might turn out to be the funniest<br> clown of 'em all. And the most successful.<br> Clown!<br> Jim boy, you're terrific. Terrific.<br> Some of them smart-aleck college<br> professors are trying to prove<br> that this here ape is your<br> great-great-grandfather.<br> Come back here. Let folks see you.<br> Well, he might be Darwin's uncle,<br> but he certainly ain't yours or mine.<br> Right, Grandpop?<br> Just a monkey, folks. Just a monkey.<br> Would Jesus play poker?<br> Would St. Paul play the stock market?<br> What do you think will get you<br> into God's own glorious heaven?<br> This ace of spades?<br> Your bank book?<br> Or this pledge to be a good Christian?<br> Sin, sin, sin.<br> You're all sinners!<br> You're all doomed to perdition.<br> You're all goin' to<br> the painful, stinkin', scaldin',<br> everlastin' tortures of a fiery hell,<br> created by God for sinners, unless...<br> unless...<br> unless you repent!<br> Repent with Sister Falconer!<br> (howls)<br> (barks)<br> Let that man alone! Let him alone!<br> Go ahead and bark, brother.<br> Go right ahead and bark!<br> There he is! The devil!<br> Bark that devil outta this tent!<br> (rhythmic clapping)<br> Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!<br> (Morgan). . the most disgusting display<br> of bad taste in my experience.<br> A human barking dog.<br> A monkey in the pulpit.<br> It's preposterous.<br> That's why it can't go on.<br> And it's obvious to everyone - even<br> dangerous. Especially before Jim Lefferts.<br> And our newspaper friend...<br> He's about as friendly as a rattlesnake.<br> - Then you think it's wrong.<br> - Not wrong. Ridiculous.<br> One minute you're preaching<br> a happy, perfumed heaven,<br> the next, Gantry's damning everyone<br> to a scalding, stinking hell.<br> - I'd say we make a pretty good team.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, like two cops<br> working over a criminal.<br> Gantry scares him with the electric chair,<br> you save him if he confesses.<br> The point is, our sinner does confess,<br> and he is saved.<br> - (Morgan) But it was ridiculous.<br> - Does the method really matter?<br> Who is this, uh, this Elmer Gantry?<br> And what do you really know about him?<br> His background, his reputation?<br> What does he want?<br> Money? My job? You? What?<br> - Bill...<br> - In 1917, Mr. Gantry<br> was expelled from<br> a theological seminary in Kansas<br> for seducing<br> the deacon's daughter in the church<br> where he had that day<br> delivered a Christmas sermon.<br> And there's more. Do you wanna hear it?<br> Ta-da!<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> you see before you a magic carpet.<br> A heavenly summons.<br> A ticket to the big time. Listen to this.<br> "Would you consider meeting with<br> the church committee and myself<br> about bringing your revival to our fair city<br> of Zenith, capital of America's Midwest?"<br> "Kindly telegraph reply immediately.<br> Signed, George F Babbitt, Secretary,<br> Zenith Chamber of Commerce,<br> Chairman of the Church Board. "<br> Zenith.<br> - We're not ready for Zenith.<br> - Mr. Babbitt thinks we are.<br> I know we are. Next stop, Zenith.<br> Then Chicago, New York, London.<br> Straight to the top<br> on the Sharon Falconer Express!<br> - In a tent? They'll laugh at us.<br> - Not at Shara.<br> It's pitchman's talk. What do you know<br> about the background of our work?<br> The nature of revivalism is rural.<br> It grew out of frontier life.<br> - Big-city people are more cynical...<br> - They're more sinful, too.<br> And more lonely<br> and more unhappy. And...<br> And, Shara, they need you more.<br> - I'm against this.<br> - Bill boy, you're an old sourpuss.<br> - This is a passport to the Promised Land.<br> - Gantry, I am not your boy.<br> You deluded her, but to me,<br> everything about you's offensive.<br> You're a crude, vulgar show-off, and<br> your vocabulary belongs in an outhouse.<br> Crude.<br> Vulgar.<br> Show-off, huh? You know something?<br> You're right, Bill. Let's put it this way.<br> You're a five-dollar textbook.<br> Me, I'm a two-cent tabloid newspaper.<br> You're too good for the people.<br> I am the people. Sure, I'm common -<br> just like most people.<br> The common people put Christianity<br> on the map in the first place.<br> What are you saying, Shara?<br> That you want to go to Zenith? Now?<br> I wonder what God wants.<br> All right, Shara. All right.<br> Maybe you are ready for Zenith.<br> - Thank you. I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - Just think of it, Shara. Zenith.<br> I think the answer to Mr. Babbitt<br> ought to come from you.<br> Tell 'em we're ready to talk, but they gotta<br> act fast. Only don't say it as crude as that.<br> No, no. I'll use some of my<br> sweet-smelling five-buck words, huh?<br> I knew we could work together.<br> Gantry, uh... I just hope you don't<br> have any ideas about who's boss.<br> Boss?<br> Why, the boss is God.<br> I'm just his messenger boy.<br> I'm sure God will be relieved.<br> Yes.<br> - Leave the money matters to me.<br> - If they get a guarantee, what do we get?<br> - Why is cash necessary at all?<br> - Order!<br> Gentlemen, without a guarantee,<br> a revival is impossible.<br> Kee-rect!<br> As chairman, I can say I want the revival,<br> but we're ministers, not financiers.<br> - I agree. After all, $30,000...<br> - Will be raised.<br> - How, Mr. Babbitt?<br> - By decent, respectable people<br> - who want to see old-time religion...<br> - I agree.<br> - Please let me finish.<br> - Of course, George.<br> - Thank you, Charlie.<br> - OK, then.<br> Everybody knows that I contribute more<br> to charity and poverty and things<br> than anybody, hm?<br> Hey, now, didn't my real-estate company<br> give you that corner lot rent-free<br> for your church baseball team, huh? Hm?<br> And I'm not even a Methodist! (laughs)<br> All right, then. I always say, business<br> is business - that's the American way!<br> - Now, if you boys...<br> - Why do you want a revival in Zenith?<br> Oh, I know what you're gettin' at, Phil.<br> You don't fool me for a second.<br> - We're aware of the financial problems.<br> - Are we aware, sir?<br> - My church hasn't been painted for years.<br> - Whose fault is that?<br> What about the gymnasium?<br> In my area, getting milk for<br> the children is the problem.<br> Your problem is<br> empty churches, gentlemen.<br> That is a fact.<br> The fact is that church attendance<br> is falling off everywhere.<br> Sister Falconer can fill your churches.<br> That's why you're here in the first place.<br> - Kee-rect!<br> - Tea, Mr. Babbitt?<br> - I always say, if you're sick, call a doctor.<br> - I agree.<br> Now, uh, let's look at<br> the record, gentlemen.<br> Sister Sharon has been in Lincoln -<br> this is going on the fifth week now.<br> - in one church alone.<br> - My church.<br> More than 2700<br> decisions for Christ, gentlemen.<br> Actual converts who signed pledges.<br> Not our statistics,<br> but printed in<br> your own Zenith newspaper.<br> And written up by... by Jim Lefferts,<br> a Pulitzer prizewinner.<br> Does the record show how long your<br> converts remain church members?<br> Well, I always say,<br> when in doubt, take action.<br> - Let's vote.<br> - Second.<br> - All in favour?<br> - Aye.<br> - Uh, just a moment, please.<br> - You're out of order.<br> - There's a motion on the floor.<br> - May I say something, please?<br> You have our...<br> undivided attention, Sister.<br> Wouldn't it be a much happier world if<br> money was not the third arm of religion?<br> He can't paint his church.<br> You can't have your gymnasium.<br> No child should be without milk.<br> And my expenses are high enough to run<br> a factory - I practically do run a factory.<br> Who do you think pays for my staff? The<br> musicians, the men who put up the tent.<br> Truck transportations, railroad fares,<br> food bills. Advertising and printing bills.<br> Electric bills, insurance bills, hotel bills.<br> The church committees always<br> expect a contribution from me,<br> and they always get it. And when I leave<br> town five weeks later, you get the benefit.<br> You have the flock,<br> and I have to start all over again.<br> No, gentlemen, you don't want a revival.<br> And I'm afraid you don't want me, either.<br> I think these gentlemen would like<br> a little privacy to kick things around.<br> - Thank you, Mr. Gantry.<br> - Excuse me.<br> I'm not ashamed to admit<br> our churches are half-empty.<br> - The ball parks are full.<br> - So are the races.<br> Let's vote.<br> Vote to do what? Marry the Church<br> to a three-ring circus?<br> To barkers who say<br> they're messengers of God?<br> Who reduce frightened farmers to howling<br> dogs? All very entertaining, I'm sure.<br> We are in competition<br> with the entertainment business.<br> - I'm not.<br> - Then you ought to be. Huh?<br> How about your bingo games?<br> And how about your baseball games<br> and square dances?<br> Now, ain't that entertainment?<br> What's the difference?<br> It's up to us to make a success out of<br> Christianity, keep the churches full.<br> What has religion<br> to do with filling churches?<br> Once there were only<br> Was Christianity a failure?<br> Did God go out of business?<br> Kee-rect! Christianity is a going concern,<br> a successful international enterprise.<br> If you boys don't get<br> young people back into church,<br> if you don't keep the train on the tracks,<br> your church boards are gonna<br> find somebody else who will.<br> Isn't that clear, Reverend Garrison?<br> Speaking for myself,<br> not my congregation or its church board,<br> religion is not a business.<br> And revivalism is not religion.<br> And my vote is no.<br> - Good night, gentlemen.<br> - Phil!<br> Harvard!<br> Well, look around you, boys. Young folks<br> crying out they're the lost generation.<br> Godless anarchists on every street<br> corner, and he walks out on a crisis.<br> Do you realise that practically<br> every president of the United States<br> was a Mason and a Protestant?<br> And every session of Congress<br> opens with a word<br> from the King James version of the Bible.<br> And right now, in our enlightened age,<br> a Catholic is running for president.<br> - Mr. Babbitt...<br> - And...<br> Mr. Babbitt!<br> Don't say another word.<br> George, I agree with you.<br> Please, John.<br> If revivalism can do the job...<br> Paul.<br> Zenith had a revival 40 years ago.<br> It saved everybody in sight for miles,<br> but today we still have<br> the same problems.<br> Please, John.<br> Please.<br> (Babbitt) Order, order. Now, now, now.<br> Gentlemen, if you'll only<br> leave the money matters to me.<br> Kee-rect!<br> (knocking at door)<br> - Welcome to Zenith, Sister.<br> - Congratulations. A wise decision.<br> Gentlemen, all your churches will be<br> closed while the revival is in progress.<br> - Great folks, aren't they?<br> - Swell, George, just swell.<br> When Sister Falconer says "Shake hands<br> for Jesus", the chorus starts singing.<br> - Brother Gantry...<br> - Just a sec. Ushers wear these badges.<br> The minute folks start comin' in,<br> you go into action.<br> Keep 'em movin'. Get pledge cards into<br> their hands, and don't forget the pencils.<br> Now, you counsellors, you'll wear<br> these lapel pennants. Pretty, eh?<br> German-speaking, hold up your hands.<br> Swedish-speaking? Fine.<br> Ask if they're regular church<br> members. Also, what church.<br> And it don't matter what church. Now,<br> some folks are gonna wanna cry. Let 'em.<br> "God is love. "<br> Jim-dandy, huh?<br> Well, that's it, I guess.<br> Tonight's the big night.<br> Are we gonna make a touchdown for<br> Jesus Christ? Any further questions?<br> - Brother Gantry...<br> - OK, then.

Right, Jim boy?<br> Why don't you get to the point?<br> Do you believe Jesus Christ<br> can give us life everlasting?<br> Do you believe Jesus Christ<br> can give us life everlasting?<br> - I'd love to believe it.<br> - But you don't?<br> No.<br> Then you don't accept<br> Jesus Christ as divine, do you?<br> Well?<br> Jesus was a great, virtuous teacher.<br> His faith and courage changed the world.<br> Do you accept Jesus Christ as divine?<br> Let me say... I have doubts.<br> - That's blasphemy!<br> - Mr. Babbitt, to doubt is not blasphemy.<br> When you say "blasphemy", you mean<br> "Don't dare disagree. Don't think. "<br> "Don't doubt. "<br> But Tolstoy, Darwin, Jefferson, Lincoln -<br> they had the same doubts.<br> Then they'll burn in hell, too!<br> Mr. Eddington, in spite of<br> Mr. Lefferts' confessed bigotry,<br> I defend your right to publish these<br> articles.

All I could think of<br> was how you took me and ditched me.<br> That's all I could think of.<br> Me, little Miss Lulu, the dumb pushover.<br> And when the cops said<br> "Get out of town in 24 hours",<br> all I wanted to do was spit in your eye,<br> blackmail you, a shakedown -<br> anything to hurt you.<br> But...<br> But when you walked in just now...<br> Gee, honey...<br> it was like the first time<br> between us all over again.<br> All goose pimples and...<br> You'd better beat it.<br> I'm sorry I phoned.<br> I won't make any trouble.<br> Not even if I could.<br> Please go now.<br> I did run out on you<br> back there in Kansas, didn't I?<br> It's nobody's fault.<br> Except maybe my old man's.<br> - Ever hear from him?<br> - Once, last Christmas.<br> The letter said "Daughter, read<br> I looked it up.

A free press<br> can print anything, including lies.<br> And that's exactly what<br> that pornography is: blackmailing lies.<br> (# "Abide With Me")<br> Why don't those men take off their hats?<br> First time I've seen<br> Reverend Pengilly up there.<br> First time they've ever<br> been in trouble up there.<br> Thank you for coming here tonight.<br> You have every right to an explanation.<br> I will try to give it to you.<br> Tell us about sin, Sister!<br> (woman) Antichrist!

It does a man good<br> to get down on his knees once in a while.<br> That's why people<br> come to a place like this,<br> because they're scared, or sick,<br> or... because they got no money,<br> or too much money.<br> Or before a war, or after a war.<br> Praying's the cheapest<br> first-rate medicine I know.<br> That's why Shara was so good for them.<br> She's a lotta woman.<br> Yeah.<br> You oughta marry her.<br> - You believe in holy matrimony?<br> - I can recommend it, never having tried it.<br> Too late now, Jim boy.<br> Maybe not.<br> Miss Bains was waiting for me<br> at the paper with that story.<br> - How'd you get her to do it?<br> - I didn't.<br> The Lord sure moves in mysterious ways.<br> Any minute now, you will hear<br> the voice of Sister Sharon Falconer,<br> but not that, I'm afraid, of Elmer Gantry.<br> For Mr. Gantry has completely vanished<br> since three nights ago.<br> I've checked the police,<br> hospitals, railroads, bus depots...<br> Where is he? Where?<br> Every wire service in the country's asking<br> the same question. He's page-one news.<br> If anything happened to him,<br> you'd know it.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I would know it.<br> He'll be here, I'm... I'm sure of it.<br> We'll wait for him.<br> We can't wait. Some of those people<br> have been out there since early morning.<br> - I won't go on without him.<br> - Maybe he won't be back.<br> Just a feeling.<br> We'll wait for him.<br> (congregation sings<br> "Onward Christian Soldiers")<br> Elmer?<br> Oh, darling!<br> Darling!<br> - Gantry's back.<br> - How do you know?<br> Somebody just saw him.<br> Where's a phone around here?<br> - What about your friend Gantry?<br> - Quite a guy! Son of a...<br> (band plays fanfare)<br> Let me look at you.<br> Three endless days without a word.<br> Why?<br> Don't you realise how much I need you?<br> Are you angry? With me?<br> - No, Shara.<br> - Don't ever leave me again. Ever.<br> Shara.<br> Yes?<br> What would happen if we chucked it all,<br> beat it across the state line,<br> get good and married, like most folks?<br> Have a bunch of kids, take 'em<br> to a ball game like most folks.<br> Go dancin'. We've never gone<br> dancin' together, not even once.<br> Let's do it, Shara. Tonight.

He<br> screamed he couldn't hear the thunder.<br> - He could feel it but he couldn't hear it.<br> - You're his wife?<br> Yes, Sister. I'm sorry to trouble you.<br> Do you believe in the Father,<br> the Son, and the Holy Ghost?<br> Do you believe that Jesus<br> could heal by the laying on of hands,<br> and that he passed<br> this gift on to his disciples?<br> Pray with me, everyone.<br> Please pray with me. I need your faith.<br> O Lord...<br> O God, be merciful.<br> Heal.<br> Heal.<br> O God, help us in our weakness.<br> Punish us for our sins,<br> but reward us for our faith.<br> Heal.<br> Heal.<br> Let thy spirit fill this tabernacle.<br> Let thy holiness bless this house,<br> created for thy glory,<br> and thine alone.<br> Heal!<br> Pray for God to heal!<br> Heal!<br> God...<br> Can you hear me?<br> God, I...<br> I...

Please wait.<br> Don't... don't... don't get excited.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Are you all right?<br> - Yes. Take care of the others, please.<br> You're in the house of God!<br> Those who believe in God will be saved.<br> Trust in the Lord!<br> Oh! Oh!<br> Are you all right, Shara? Shara? Shara?<br> - No. No. No. No. No!<br> - Shara!<br> Help!<br> No, please wait.<br> No, wait! Please, wait!<br> Wait! You must have faith!<br> - Wait!<br> - Shara!<br> Shara!<br> Shara!<br> Shara!<br> Shara! Shara!<br> Shara! Shara!<br> It's hers.<br> It's all we could find.<br> People everywhere would appreciate a<br> word from you, Mr. Gantry. Anything at all.<br> Speak to us, Mr. Gantry.<br> Please ask Sister Sharon to forgive us.<br> There ain't nothin' to forgive.<br> It was mighty hot in there.<br> Hotter than the fires of damnation.<br> I ran. I was afraid.<br> Please ask Sister not to hate me.<br> Can you hear me up there, Sister?<br> Do you hate these folks?<br> She don't hate you.
