                        [ Narrator ] ln a time<br> when one's town was one's world...<br> and the actions at a dance<br> excited greater interest...<br> than the movement of armies,<br> there lived a young woman who knew<br> how this world should be run.<br> The most beautiful thing<br> in the world is a match well made...<br> and a happy marriage<br> to you both.<br> Thank you, Emma. Your painting<br> grows more accomplished every day.<br> You are very kind,<br> but it would be all the better...<br> if I practiced my drawing<br> more as you urged me.<br> It's very beautiful.<br> I should never take side<br> against you, Miss Woodhouse,<br> but your friend is right.<br> It is indeed a job well done.<br> A job well done, Mr. Elton,<br> was yours in performing the ceremony.<br> Must the church be<br> so drafty, Mr. Elton ?<br> It is very difficult<br> to surrender the soul...<br> when one is worried<br> about one's throat.<br> Perhaps some tea and cake<br> would revive you, Mr. Woodhouse ?<br> Miss Taylor, surely you're<br> not serving cake at your wedding ?<br> Far too rich. You put us all at peril.<br> And I am not alone in feeling so.<br> Where is Mr. Perry, the apothecary ?<br> He will support me.<br> He is over there, Mr. Woodhouse,<br> having some cake.<br> What ?<br> I have to take Father home.<br> But dear Miss Taylor--<br> Oh, no !<br> You are "Dear Miss Taylor" no more !<br> You are dear Mrs. Weston now.<br> And how happy<br> this must make you.<br> Such happiness this brings<br> to all of us.<br> My dear Emma !<br> [ Woodhouse ] Poor Miss Taylor.<br> She was so happy here.<br> Why should she give up being<br> your governess only to be married ?<br> I am grown now.<br> She cannot put up<br> with my ill humors forever.<br> - She must wish for children of her own.<br> - You have no ill humors.<br> Your own mother,<br> God rest her,<br> could be no more real<br> than Miss Taylor.<br> Can she truly wish to give life<br> to a mewling infant...<br> who will import disease<br> each time it enters the house ?<br> No ! I said poor Miss Taylor<br> and poor, indeed, she is.<br> [ Man ] As an old friend of the family<br> I had to ask as soon as I got back:<br> Who cried the most<br> at the wedding ?<br> [ Chuckling ]<br> And how is my sister ? ls your brother<br> giving her the respect...<br> we Woodhouse ladies deserve ?<br> Poor lsabella.<br> She was the first to leave me.<br> No doubt, that is where<br> Miss Taylor got the notion to go.<br> Don't be too hard<br> on Miss Taylor.<br> It must be easier for her to have<br> only one to please than two.<br> Especially when one of us<br> is such a troublesome creature.<br> - Yes, I am... most troublesome.<br> - [ Giggles ]<br> Dear Papa,<br> I could never mean you.<br> Mr. Knightley loves<br> to find fault with me, that's all.<br> It's his idea of a joke.<br> I'm practically a brother<br> to you, Emma.<br> Is it not a brother's job<br> to find fault with his sister ?<br> But where is the fault with you ?<br> Emma bears it well. But she is<br> most sorry to lose Miss Taylor.<br> We would not like Emma so well<br> as we do if she did not miss her friend.<br> Thank you.<br> I shall miss her so.<br> I do not know what<br> I shall do without her.<br> - She's not far.<br> - Almost half a mile !<br> Her obligations are there now.<br> She cannot sit and talk<br> with me in the old way,<br> or walk with me,<br> or urge me to better myself.<br> That should not matter as you<br> always did just as you pleased.<br> Yes. But I shall<br> miss her urging me.<br> She was as selfless a friend<br> as I have ever had.<br> I hope to say someday I have done<br> half as much for someone...<br> as Mrs. Weston did for me.<br> You must be happy<br> that she settled so well.<br> [ Emma ]<br> lndeed !<br> One matter of joy in this<br> is that I made the match myself.<br> People said Mr. Weston<br> would never marry again.<br> - And what a triumph.<br> - Triumph ?<br> - You made a lucky guess.<br> - Have you never known<br> the triumph of a lucky guess ?<br> Had I not promoted<br> Mr. Weston's visits...<br> and given encouragement<br> where encouragement was needed,<br> we might not have had<br> a wedding today.<br> Then please, my dear,<br> encourage no one else.<br> Marriage is so disrupting<br> to one's social circle.<br> Only one more, Papa.<br> When Mr. Elton<br> joined their hands today,<br> he looked very much as if he would like<br> the same kind office performed for him.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Invite him for dinner.<br> That is kindness enough.<br> Mr. Elton is a man of 26.<br> He knows how to take care of himself.<br> One does not like to generalize about so<br> many people all at once, Mr. Knightley,<br> but you may be sure that men<br> know nothing about their hearts...<br> whether they be six and twenty<br> or six and eighty.<br> Excepting you, of course,<br> Father.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> No.<br> Mr. Elton will be the next person<br> to benefit from my help.<br> [ Knightley ]<br> Poor Miss Taylor, indeed !<br> It is Mr. Elton<br> who deserves our pity.<br> [ Chuckling ]<br> [ Emma ]<br> Mr. Elton !<br> Welcome to our party.<br> Miss Woodhouse, thank you indeed<br> for including me.<br> A party is a party.<br> But a party on a summer's eve, mmm !<br> It relieves my mind<br> very much that you are here.<br> For there is someone new in our group.<br> Her name is Harriet Smith.<br> And she is a former pupil<br> of Mrs. Goddard's.<br> I had never met Miss Smith<br> before this evening...<br> and I'm already struck<br> by her charm.<br> I wondered<br> if I might ask you...<br> to make certain she is at ease<br> throughout the evening.<br> If helping Miss Smith<br> would help Miss Woodhouse,<br> then I'm happy<br> to be of service.<br> Come.<br> I shall make the introduction.<br> Miss Woodhouse,<br> we come quite overpowered.<br> Oh, Mrs. Bates, Miss Bates.<br> So happy you could come.<br> [ Miss Bates ]<br> No ! We are the happy ones.<br> W-Well, how do you do,<br> Mr. Elton ?<br> We are the happy ones,<br> not only to be here tonight,<br> but for the beautiful<br> hindquarter of pork you sent us.<br> It has been heaven itself. What<br> a happy porker it must have come from !<br> We're so obliged<br> for your sending it to us.<br> Pork ! And we're so obliged<br> for your having us tonight.<br> Very much indeed. I was<br> just saying to Mother, we should<br> be obliged and indeed we are.<br> Oh, doesn't your hair look pretty ?<br> Just like an angel.<br> Angel, Mother !<br> Oh, speaking of angels,<br> Mr. Elton,<br> your sermon on Daniel in the lion's den<br> was so inspiring.<br> So powerful in all its particulars.<br> It left us speechless.<br> Quite speechless, I tell you.<br> We have not stopped talking of it since.<br> Isn't this a lovely party ?<br> Lovely ! Lovely ! Lovely !<br> Where will you live now that<br> you've completed your education ?<br> Mrs. Goddard has been kind enough<br> to let me stay on with her.<br> - She's a great help to me.<br> If you'll excuse me.<br> - [ Woodhouse ] Mrs. Goddard.<br> - Mr. Knightley.<br> - Ah, Emma. I wondered where you were.<br> But now I see you've been hard at work<br> making Mr. Elton comfortable.<br> Yes, but I've been remiss<br> in doing the one thing...<br> that shall bring him<br> the greatest enjoyment.<br> [ Emma ]<br> Mr. Elton.<br> May I present Miss Smith ?<br> Any friend of Miss Woodhouse is--<br> Mr. Weston, have you had<br> any news of your son ?<br> Oh, indeed.<br> Miss Smith, I was married<br> many years ago...<br> to a woman whose life<br> was lost to illness...<br> just three years after<br> the birth of our son, Frank.<br> As I could not see to my business<br> and care for the infant,<br> I allowed him to be brought up<br> by my wife's brother...<br> and his wife, the Churchills.<br> He lives in London now,<br> a young man,<br> and has never been here.<br> His aunt is not well and she<br> does not care to be without him.<br> His coming would be the final blessing<br> for our marriage.<br> How lucky to have been<br> twice blessed in marriage.<br> It has been my belief<br> that one loves only once.<br> I'm happy to be wrong.<br> [ Weston ]<br> Not so happy as l, Miss Smith.<br> I had the most pleasing letter from him<br> on the occasion of our marriage.<br> I have it here if anyone<br> would care to see it.<br> A most charming and kindly letter.<br> Don't you think so, Mother ?<br> Have, have you ever read<br> such a letter, Mr. Knightley ?<br> Do you know, this... this reminds me<br> of Jane's style somewhat.<br> It's a very delicate style<br> which is more usual in a woman,<br> but a good sign in a man,<br> I think.<br> Nicely expressed.<br> But it sounds as though he eats<br> a worrisome amount of custard.<br> It's not merely<br> the feeling in it.<br> The penmanship<br> is so confident.<br> -Isn't Miss Smith delightful ?<br> -I watched her with continuous pleasure.<br> She is uncertain in these surroundings,<br> yet I thought perhaps...<br> I could be of service to her, undertake<br> her introduction into Highbury society.<br> I could never presume<br> to guide her as you did me.<br> Oh !<br> But I might be able to share<br> a little of what I know.<br> She could ask<br> for nothing better.<br> Come, Mr. Weston,<br> I must write to your son.<br> Good night, Mr. Woodhouse.<br> [ Weston ]<br> Good night, Mr. Woodhouse.<br> Good night, Emma.<br> Thank you for a wonderful dinner.<br> - Good night, Miss Taylor.<br> - Good night, Mrs. Weston, Mr. Weston.<br> [ Weston ]<br> Good night.<br> Poor Miss Taylor.<br> She so obviously wanted to stay.<br> How interesting, Miss Smith. And what<br> kind of people are your parents ?<br> I do not know.<br> Mrs. Goddard has said that I cannot<br> know them and so I have left it at that.<br> Because of her attentions<br> over the years, Mrs. Goddard<br> has been my true guardian.<br> [ Gasps ] Hurry along, dear.<br> It's Miss Bates coming.<br> [ Emma ]<br> As it is Tuesday...<br> she will have a letter<br> from her niece Jane Fairfax,<br> and she will want to<br> read us every word.<br> - Oh, I do not know Miss Fairfax.<br> - There's not much to be said for her.<br> When pressed,<br> I say she is elegant.<br> [ Miss Bates Giggles ]<br> [ Miss Bates Chatting ]<br> [ Harriet ]<br> Besides you and Mrs. Goddard,<br> the only other people I know here<br> are the Martins of Abbey Mill Farm.<br> Mrs. Martin had two parlors<br> and an upper maid and eight cows !<br> Mr. Martin used to cut fresh flowers<br> every day. [ Gasps ]<br> [ Emma ] How lucky for Mrs. Martin<br> to have such an agreeable husband !<br> Oh, Miss Woodhouse, Mr. Martin<br> is not her husband. He is her son.<br> Ahh ! I see.<br> And he is...<br> unmarried.<br> Mmm. Though<br> I cannot understand why.<br> He seems perfect<br> in every particular.<br> He brought me walnuts once,<br> and went three miles to get them...<br> just because he heard me<br> say I liked them.<br> Wasn't that kind ?<br> [ Gasps ]<br> [ Emma ] Tell me more about Mr. Martin.<br> Is he a man of information ?<br> [ Harriet ] Oh, yes.<br> He reads the agricultural reports.<br> And I recommended he read The Romance<br> of the Forest, and he said he would.<br> And what sort of looking man<br> is he ?<br> Mmm. I thought him<br> very plain at first,<br> but I do not think so now.<br> Have you never seen him<br> when he is in town ?<br> A family like the Martins...<br> are precisely the sort of people<br> with whom I have nothing to do.<br> A degree or two lower, and I might<br> be useful to their families.<br> But a farmer<br> needs none of my help...<br> and is therefore as much<br> above my notice as he is below it.<br> - In fact--<br> - Miss Woodhouse, there he is now !<br> - How do I look ?<br> - Fine, dear.<br> Good enough I'm sure<br> for Mr. Martin.<br> Good day. This is a bit<br> of a chance, isn't it ?<br> Good day, Mr. Martin. Miss Woodhouse,<br> may I present Mr. Martin ?<br> - This is Miss Woodhouse.<br> - Good day. How do you do ?<br> Oh. Were you able to find<br> The Romance of the Forest ?<br> Oh, blast ! I forgot.<br> But I go again tomorrow,<br> and I will make every effort<br> to get that thought into my head.<br> How's your mother ?<br> [ Thinking ] Really, Harriet,<br> we can do better than this.<br> [ Emma ]<br> lf you pull this way, dear,<br> you'll find it makes<br> a neater stitch.<br> Of course !<br> May I ask what you thought<br> of my friend, Robert Martin ?<br> Well, dear,<br> I imagined him<br> a degree nearer gentility.<br> True. He's not so genteel<br> as Mr. Knightley, but--<br> No !<br> Not one in a hundred men<br> has "gentleman"...<br> so plainly written across him<br> as Mr. Knightley.<br> But let us judge him next to<br> another man. Oh, say... Mr. Elton.<br> Mr. Elton is a fine man.<br> Thoughtful in ways<br> Mr. Martin can never be.<br> Miss Woodhouse, whatever his faults,<br> Mr. Martin is thoughtful.<br> I see.<br> Did he take your advice and get<br> the book you asked him to read ?<br> Um--<br> Well... no.<br> Yes.<br> Yes !<br> I wonder that he<br> did not remember it.<br> Oh, well.<br> Mr. Elton said something very kind<br> about you the other day.<br> - Can you not tell me what it was ?<br> - Oh !<br> It is not my place to intrude<br> in personal matters.<br> But, as your friend, I could<br> make an exception if you wish.<br> [ Elton ] Miss Smith<br> was always a beautiful creature.<br> But the attractions<br> you have added are far superior.<br> Oh, I have done very little.<br> If it were admissible<br> to contradict a lady--<br> I cannot take credit for her beauty,<br> nor her sweetness, nor--<br> An idea has just dropped into my mind,<br> surely from heaven itself.<br> What if you were to exercise<br> your artistic talents...<br> and draw a portrait<br> of Miss Smith ?<br> How I would love<br> to watch you draw her.<br> Mr. Elton, my skills<br> are slender indeed,<br> and we must not forget<br> how shy Miss Smith is.<br> Oh.<br> Do you think it would help<br> if I asked her to pose ?<br> Oh, Miss Woodhouse,<br> may I look, please ?<br> I cannot wait another second.<br> Incredible.<br> You have expressed her<br> completely.<br> Mr. Elton, really !<br> You exaggerate.<br> [ Elton ]<br> lndeed, I do not.

It was very good.<br> Finally I said I had to go.<br> But then he followed me.<br> I was not three steps outside<br> and he said--<br> Miss Smith !<br> You better go<br> by Mr. Cole's stable.<br> The near way is flooded.<br> Thank you.<br> [ Sighs ] Miss Woodhouse,<br> do talk and make me comfortable again.<br> [ Thinking ] I suppose this<br> would not be the right time...<br> to mention that Mr. Elton<br> is engaged.<br> This was awkward because<br> it was the first time...<br> - you've seen Mr. Martin<br> since refusing his proposal.<br> - No.<br> You, and I must say he,<br> behaved very well !<br> Now, the kindest thing<br> you can do for yourself...<br> is to put Mr. Martin<br> out of your head for good.<br> Yes, I will.<br> I shall do so immediately.<br> - He's behind me now. [ Giggles ]<br> - Wonderful !<br> I thought I might sketch the puppies.<br> Would you join me ?<br> Oh, yes, please !<br> It was awfully kind of him<br> to warn me about the flooding.<br> - Yes, dear.<br> - He got his coat wet<br> coming out to tell me.<br> That's the coat Mrs. Martin<br> gave him for his birthday.<br> I do hope he does not catch cold.<br> [ Clanking Sound ]<br> Oh, good heavens.<br> [ Laughing ]<br> Is your horse just washing his feet or<br> are there darker forces at work here ?<br> [ Laughing ]<br> The latter, I'm afraid.<br> Something has happened<br> to the wheel and I cannot move.<br> You'll just have to live here then.<br> Bye, bye.<br> I suppose that won't do.<br> I'll help you home.<br> Thank you so much, Mr.--<br> Churchill.<br> Frank Churchill.<br> A name I know as well as my own<br> so long I have heard it spoken.<br> Your father's wife<br> was my governess.<br> Then you are Miss Woodhouse !<br> How delightful.<br> I, I hear of nothing but you.<br> The last I heard from Mrs. Weston,<br> you were not due 'til tomorrow.<br> It is always a pleasure to come in on<br> one's friends before the lookout begins.<br> I would not presume to do so<br> in most cases,<br> but I felt in coming home,<br> I might be forgiven.<br> Then you have not seen them ?<br> We shall have to go there first.<br> They will be overjoyed.<br> Overjoyed, I think,<br> that we are both there together.<br> As I am.<br> Oh, Miss Woodhouse,<br> have you heard ?<br> - Frank Churchill is here !<br> - Yes ! ln fact...<br> - I met him yesterday.<br> - No ?<br> Yes. He did me quite<br> a service when my horse--<br> Is he handsome ?<br> ls he everything everyone says he is ?<br> I have not yet seen him myself,<br> though, um, Jane saw him...<br> and she said he was<br> not at all unpleasant to look at.<br> I suppose I shan't see him<br> until the Cole's party...<br> which seems like<br> such an age from now.<br> But I'm sure, simply sure,<br> will be upon us before...<br> well, we are sufficiently prepared.<br> [ Giggles ]<br> Has an invitation arrived<br> for a party at the Cole's ?<br> No, thank heaven !<br> The Coles are nice people, but we<br> should have to go outside to get there.<br> Of course we shall have to decline<br> as they are beneath us.<br> But I don't wish them<br> to hope falsely.<br> [ Footsteps ]<br> - Has James brought the letters yet ?<br> - I don't know.<br> I never pay any attention<br> to the mail.<br> Why do they not write ?<br> Perhaps they know<br> I must reject them.<br> Still, as close friends<br> of the Westons,<br> they should have the courtesy<br> to extend the invitation.<br> Unless they don't want me.<br> But I cannot--<br> Tell you how delighted I am<br> to have been invited, Mrs. Cole.<br> - [ Churchill ] lsn't it handsome ?<br> - Thank you.<br> But from today there's<br> a much prettier one in town.<br> - It has been sent to Jane Fairfax.<br> - Really ? Who sent it to her ?<br> That's the exciting part ! There was<br> no identification of the donor.<br> - Must be from Colonel Campbell.<br> - Jane's parents died.<br> And the Bates, of course, are quite<br> without the resources to, you know.<br> And Colonel Campbell was<br> a great friend of her father's,<br> so he and his family<br> have raised her.<br> Well, then they must have sent it.<br> Jane has just had a letter from them,<br> and not a word was said of it.<br> Perhaps it's a surprise.<br> We expect Miss Fairfax soon.<br> Perhaps she may know more.<br> Why do you smile ?<br> I'm smiling because I wonder<br> if there's anyone else...<br> whom we should suspect of being<br> Miss Fairfax's musical patron ?<br> - Do you know her ?<br> - Oh, yes, she's very elegant. Yes.<br> Colonel Campbell's daughter, Mrs. Dixon,<br> is Miss Fairfax's dearest friend,<br> so perhaps Mrs. Dixon<br> sent the piano.<br> Mrs. Dixon ?<br> That makes sense.<br> As much sense do you think<br> as Mr. Dixon ?<br> I cannot help suspecting that<br> after his proposal to Miss Campbell,<br> a sweet<br> but rather a plain girl,<br> Mr. Dixon fell in love with Miss Fairfax<br> who is, after all--<br> Very elegant, yes.<br> But what makes you say that ?<br> Well, she must think so too.<br> That is why she did not go<br> on the holiday with the Campbells.<br> Instead she came here.<br> Do you see ?<br> Now that Mr. Dixon has married into<br> the Campbells, he would have been there.<br> I think that in coming here,<br> Miss Fairfax was telling Mr. Dixon...<br> that she wanted to forget him.<br> And I think with the pianoforte,<br> Mr. Dixon wasn't allowing her to.<br> [ Mrs. Cole ] Mrs. Bates, Miss Bates,<br> do come in. Welcome to our house.<br> Of course it's just a theory.<br> But let us see how she reacts at some<br> time if we say the name, Mr. Dixon.<br> My dear, do you know how Miss Bates<br> and Jane Fairfax came here tonight ?<br> Mr. Knightley<br> sent his carriage.<br> Well, yes, he's very kind.<br> You give him credit for more<br> disinterested benevolence than l.<br> A suspicion has darted into my head<br> which I simply cannot get rid of.<br> Mr. Knightley and<br> Jane Fairfax are a couple.<br> [ Laughs ] Mrs. Weston, do not<br> take to matchmaking. You do it ill.<br> Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley ?<br> Every feeling revolts !<br> - Apart from every other--<br> - [ Mrs. Weston ] Oh, my goodness !<br> What if the pianoforte<br> is from Mr. Knightley ?<br> You have taken up an idea and run wild<br> with it. He is not even with her.<br> [ Emma ]<br> She is with Frank, poor man.<br> Perhaps the two of them stay apart<br> publicly to keep it a secret.<br> [ Gasps ] Hush, friend.<br> Here comes-- Mr. Cole !<br> Miss Woodhouse, would you do us<br> the honor of trying our pianoforte ?<br> Oh.<br> I fear I lack the talent.<br> Perhaps I should ask<br> Miss Fairfax ?<br> musicmusic [ Piano ]<br> music Did you not hear my lady music<br> music Go down the garden singing music<br> music Blackbird and thrush<br> were silent music<br> music To hear the earlies ringing music<br> music Oh, saw you not my lady music<br> music Out in the garden there music<br> music Shaming the rose and lily music<br> music For she is twice as fair music<br> music Though I am nothing to her music<br> music Though she must rarely<br> look at me music<br> music And though<br> I could never woo her music<br> music I'll love her 'til I die music<br> [ Together ]<br> music Surely you heard my lady music<br> music Go down the garden singing music<br> music Silencing all the songbirds music<br> music And setting the earlies ringing music<br> music But surely you see my lady music<br> music Out in the garden there music<br> music Rivalling<br> the glittering sunshine music<br> music With the glory<br> of golden hair musicmusic<br> [ Guests Muttering,<br> Applauding ]<br> Excuse me.<br> Do you know that piece<br> from The Beggar's Opera ?<br> - [ Jane ] Oh, yes.<br> - Shall we ?<br> musicmusic [ Piano ]<br> music Virgins are like<br> the fair flower music<br> music ln its luster music<br> music Which in the garden music<br> music Enamels the ground music<br> [ Churchill ]<br> music Near it the bees in play music<br> music Flutter and cluster music<br> music And gaudy butterflies music<br> music Frolic around music<br> - musicmusic [ Singing Continues ]<br> - Isn't she playing marvelously ?<br> Yes.<br> How sweet to have lent<br> your carriage to her...<br> so that her fingers would<br> be warm enough for the performance.<br> - Your playing was lovely.<br> - [ Sighs ]<br> - Much inferior to Miss Fairfax's.<br> - No !<br> No.<br> It was... very elegant.<br> [ Churchill ]<br> music Rots, stinks and dies musicmusic<br> Was not that sweet of the Campbells<br> to give her so generous a gift ?<br> I don't approve of surprises.<br> The pleasure is never enhanced,<br> and the inconvenience is considerable.<br> - [ Guests Applauding ]<br> - Bad judgment on the Campbell's part.<br> Miss Fairfax,<br> shall we sing another ?<br> That fellow thinks of nothing<br> but showing off.<br> Jane will sing herself hoarse.<br> Miss Bates ?<br> - Yes, Mr. Knightley ?<br> - You must put a stop to this.<br> - She'll make herself ill.<br> - Oh, do you think so ?<br> - Yes.<br> - Well, I shall.

And although<br> I expect my father at any moment,<br> I could not leave<br> without stopping here.<br> Not even five minutes to spare for your<br> friends, Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates ?<br> - How unlucky !<br> - No. I stopped there on my way here.<br> After all their kindness,<br> I don't wish to slight them.<br> But it is not the Bates nor my aunt<br> that occupies my thoughts...<br> as I prepare to leave.<br> There is something much more personal<br> that I must say to you.<br> I think you can hardly be without<br> suspicion that I have developed...<br> certain feelings for someone<br> of a most tender and devoted nature,<br> which so far<br> I have striven to hide.<br> Yet you have always made me feel<br> so wonderfully at ease,<br> such a friend,<br> since my very arrival...<br> that it not longer seems honorable<br> to keep them from you.<br> In short, Miss Woodhouse,<br> I cannot help but say to you--<br> [ Charles ]<br> Mr. Weston.<br> [ Churchill ] Mrs. Weston<br> has promised to correspond.<br> The blessings of a female correspondent<br> when one wants news.<br> In her letters<br> I shall be at Highbury,<br> and here again... with you.<br> [ Emma Thinking ]<br> Well, he loves me.<br> He was on the verge of telling me<br> when his father burst in.<br> I felt listless after he left<br> and had some sort of headache,<br> so I must be in love as well.<br> I must confess I expected love<br> to feel somewhat different than this.<br> I may determine how deep a love<br> I feel through his absence.<br> How I wish he would be here tomorrow<br> because there is a grim job to be done.<br> Mr. Elton is bringing<br> his new wife to tea.<br> Oh, you know, your home<br> reminds me of Maple Grove,<br> - which is the seat<br> of my brother, Mr. Suckling.<br> - Suckling.<br> - The hall?

Ah.<br> Well, I know little<br> of other places.<br> We are...<br> a quiet set of people.<br> - More disposed to stay at home.<br> - Yes.<br> Your father's health must be a great<br> drawback to your seeing the country.<br> Why does he not try Bath ?<br> It would do him the world of good !<br> He has... tried it before<br> without receiving any benefit.<br> Oh, it will do him good<br> if only to improve his spirits,<br> which, I understand,<br> are sometimes much depressed.<br> You must take him !<br> A line from me and...<br> you would have some of<br> the best society in the place.<br> And my particular friend there,<br> Mrs. Partridge--<br> Thank you, but our going to Bath<br> is out of the question.<br> Mrs. Elton, I have not<br> asked you if you are musical,<br> and that is because<br> your reputation has preceded you.<br> Oh, well--<br> All the town knows<br> you are a superior performer.<br> - Well, I am dotingly fond of music.<br> - Yes, my wife--<br> And my friends say I'm not<br> entirely devoid of taste.<br> In fact, I told Mr. "E"<br> when he asked me to marry,<br> I said I did not have to have<br> two carriages as I did before,<br> and I could even accept<br> a smaller house.<br> My house before was<br> a good deal roomier, I assure you.<br> But, no, the world<br> is not necessary to me...<br> because I am blessed<br> with so many resources... in here.<br> "But," said l, "without music<br> my life would be a blank."<br> In fact, you and I<br> must establish a musical club !<br> We could have regular meetings<br> at your house or ours.<br> Because I don't want<br> to give up my talent.<br> - Do I ?<br> - Mrs. Elton,<br> I am certain it would take something<br> more dramatic than a change of towns...<br> to dislodge a thing<br> as great as your talent.<br> [ Laughing ] Oh, well,<br> I myself don't call it great.<br> I only know that<br> my friends think so.<br> - [ Clears Throat ]<br> - [ Sighs ]<br> Ooh !

Base ? Conceited ? Crass ?<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Starr ?<br> - Good morning, Miss Woodhouse.<br> She actually seemed pleased to discover<br> that Mr. Knightley was a gentleman.<br> I doubt he'll return the compliment<br> and find her a lady.<br> - Mr. Simons, good morning.<br> - Morning, Miss Woodhouse.<br> She proposed that we form<br> a musical club.<br> Is it possible<br> that Mr. Elton met her...<br> while doing charitable work<br> in a mental infirmary ?<br> [ Sighs ]<br> There is only one thing to do<br> with a person as impossible as she.<br> - What ?<br> - I must throw a party for her,<br> otherwise everyone will feel at once<br> how much I dislike her.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> We're so excited about the party.<br> Do you know whom I just adore ?<br> - Who I want to wrap up<br> and put in my pocket ?<br> - Knightley ?<br> Jane Fairfax ! Oh ! Ah !<br> I rave about her.<br> Do you know what<br> I admire most about her ?<br> She's timid.<br> I'm a great advocate for timidity.<br> But I daresay you know<br> the lines of the poet:<br> "Full many a flower<br> is born to blush unseen."<br> We must not allow them<br> to be verified by sweet Jane.<br> There is no danger of that.<br> The Campbells take great care of her.<br> Whatever advantages she's got from the<br> Campbells have palpably come to an end.<br> But if you and I set the example,<br> many will follow.<br> Oh, we live in a style which could not<br> make the addition of Jane Fairfax...<br> the least inconvenient.<br> I'm simply going to adopt her,<br> and I think that you<br> should do it with me.<br> [ Emma ]<br> For the first time in my life,<br> I felt sorry<br> for Jane Fairfax.<br> Whatever she may have done,<br> she does not deserve Mrs. Elton.<br> Jane may be glad<br> of Mrs. Elton's attentions,<br> since they are available<br> from no one else.<br> She seems to receive<br> ample attention from you.<br> - Anyone may know my regard for her.<br> - Oh ?<br> - Do you know how high it is ?<br> - [ Clears Throat ]<br> Oh, so, you two<br> have been settling...<br> - that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?<br> - No !<br> You could not come and sit with us<br> if you were married.<br> Jane Fairfax<br> is a very charming young woman.<br> But she lacks an open temper,<br> which a man wishes for in a wife.<br> I have admiration for her,<br> but no thought beyond,<br> not at all.<br> No.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Ah, I see Mr. Weston is at home.<br> I'll go and see him.<br> Well, Mrs. Weston, what do you say<br> about your suspicions now ?<br> He's so very occupied with his<br> not being in love with her,<br> it seems certain that he is.<br> - Help yourself.<br> - Thank you.<br> It was most kind of you<br> to invite Jane Fairfax this evening.<br> Your words the other day<br> shamed me.<br> I have not tried as I should have.<br> You're capable of great kindness.<br> I fall short so often.<br> And I highly doubt<br> she will find this a kindness.<br> Jane, you're a very,<br> very fragile creature.<br> You pay no regard to the delicacy<br> of your constitution.<br> Jane.
