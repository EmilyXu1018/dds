                        Thanks, ma'am.<br> To wounded soldier - sixpence.<br> Are you reading about the castle<br> and the wisteria?<br> What? Uh, yes. Why?<br> It just... it seems so wonderful,<br> and it's such a miserable day.<br> Perhaps that's why<br> it seems so wonderful.<br> No, no.<br> It is so wonderful.<br> Wonderful, yes, but it's not worth<br> wasting one's time thinking about.<br> No, it is.<br> I... I believe we're neighbors.<br> I see you every Sunday in church<br> - Chapel Street, Hampstead -<br> but we've never actually spoken.<br> I'm Mrs. Rose Arbuthnot.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> I'm Lotti Wilkins...<br> Mrs. Lotti Wilkins.<br> I don't suppose<br> that means much to you.<br> Sometimes it doesn't<br> mean much to me, either,<br> but I am Mrs. Wilkins.<br> I'm sure you are.<br> I've never really liked the name<br> Wilkins very much.<br> It's such a small name<br> with a mean little<br> twist at the end, you know.<br> "Kins. " "Kins. "<br> It's like a pug dog's little tail,<br> but it is Mellersh's name.<br> Mellersh Wilkins is my husband,<br> so Im stuck with it.<br> Um, he's a solicitor.<br> He's very handsome.<br> That must be nice for you.<br> Why?<br> Well, um...<br> because beauty... handsomeness<br> is a gift from God,<br> like any other...<br> and if used properly,<br> it can be, well...<br> Why don't we...<br> Sorry.<br> Why don't we try and get it?<br> - Get it?<br> - Yes!<br> Not just say<br> how wonderful it would be<br> and then go back to Hampstead<br> without doing anything about it,<br> as we have been doing<br> for years and years and years.<br> But how do you mean, "get it"?<br> Rent it. Hire it. Have it.<br> The castle. The wisteria.<br> Everything.<br> You and me?<br> Yes. We'll share.<br> That way it will<br> only cost half,<br> and you look as though you<br> wanted it as much as I do.<br> You look so beautiful and so sad.<br> I'm not sad!<br> It's my face!<br> I can't help it.<br> My husband says I have the face<br> of a disappointed Madonna.<br> He has a way with words.<br> My husband never says a word<br> too much or a word too little.<br> Sometimes I think he keeps copies<br> of everything he says.<br> It's very disheartening.<br> If you wish for something<br> hard enough, it happens.<br> Lotti, I've told you before<br> about buying flowers.<br> They are an extravagance<br> of the most blatant kind.<br> They always die, Lotti.<br> Then you have to buy more.<br> I know, Mellersh, but I like<br> the color, and...<br> We're not rich, Lotti.<br> I own no stocks and shares.<br> What would happen to you<br> if tomorrow...<br> I were to be knocked down by a tram<br> and you were still buying flowers?<br> We have to watch every penny, Lotti.<br> I understand, Mellersh.<br> You are still recording every purchase<br> in that book I bought you?<br> Yes. Even the flowers.<br> Good.<br> Now...<br> about the party.<br> We should arrive at, um...<br> N8:40, I think.<br> Yes.<br> We'd look too eager.<br> as if we're not interested.<br> Well, 8:40 it is.<br> Can't I stay at home, Mellersh?<br> All these artists... there are<br> so many in Hampstead,<br> and I never know<br> what to say to them.<br> Praise them, my dear. Praise<br> them, and you can't go wrong.<br> But no one will know<br> Im there even if I am.<br> I'm sure your sister won't mind<br> if I don't turn up.<br> But I would.<br> As a family solicitor,<br> I have to be seen as a reliable<br> family man... with wife.<br> Excellent sole, my dear.<br> Mellersh, I've been thinking.<br> As you know, this, um...<br> terrible weather, and I..<br> I wonder if...<br> you would mind...?<br> Apple dumplings.<br> ...if you would mind<br> apple dumplings.<br> Temptations, friends.<br> The devil never sleeps<br> when it comes to temptation.<br> Of course, II Peter<br> "The Lord knows how to deliver<br> the godly out of temptations,<br> but he doesn't always bother. "<br> I see us, you and me, this April<br> in that castle by the sea.<br> I'm certain of it.<br> Have you ever seen things in a<br> kind of flash before they happen?<br> Never.<br> I'm sure it must be wrong to be good<br> for so long you become miserable.<br> I can see you've been good<br> for years, and you aren't happy.<br> And... I've been doing things for<br> other people since I was a little girl,<br> and I don't believe<br> I'm loved any better.<br> Are you all right?<br> You must believe<br> I've never spoken to anyone<br> like this in my life.<br> I don't know what's come<br> over me.<br> It's the advertisement.<br> Yes... and us being so miserable.<br> There's no harm in simply...<br> asking about it, is there?<br> Hello, my dear.<br> You waited up.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> I've made you something.<br> Thank you.<br> I had enough at the reception.<br> Yes, I can see.<br> After all, it was for my book.<br> You should have been there, my dear.<br> I missed you.<br> I wonder.<br> Of course I did.<br> I thought about us in Vienna.<br> Do you remember Vienna?<br> Or was it Prague?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> The golden rule is, if you've got<br> yourself in a hole, stop digging.<br> Drink your milk, Frederick.<br> It'll settle your stomach.<br> What do you think?<br> People seem to like it.<br> Frederick...<br> no one should ever write a book<br> God wouldn't like to read.<br> It's the way I earn a living.<br> Out of the immorality of fallen women.<br> They are dead.<br> Sin never dies, Frederick.<br> That's rather a depressing thought.<br> Anyway, I know your views,<br> so I've always been very careful.<br> You are married to<br> Fredrick R. Arbuthnot, gentleman.<br> Gerald Arundal wrote<br> this and all the others.<br> Nobody knows it's a pseudonym.<br> God knows.<br> God must know an awful lot.<br> Why doesn't he do something?<br> Fredrick, I'm thinking<br> of taking a holiday in Italy<br> this spring with a friend.<br> It's a splendid idea.<br> Yes, that's what I thought<br> you'd say.<br> It's just what you need.<br> - And as for the money...<br> - I shall be using my own, Frederick.<br> You only have to ask.<br> Actually, it all works out rather well, because<br> I shall be out and about promoting my book.<br> Do you think we should<br> go on with this?<br> Sixty pounds, Lottie!<br> But 60 pounds, plus fares, plus<br> expenses for food and such like...<br> We could buy a great many boots<br> for the poor with that money...<br> We could advertise<br> for two ladies to join us.<br> That way it would only cost<br> There's something immoral about all this.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, thank you. No.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Briggs.<br> We've come in answer<br> to your letter about renting<br> the castle in Italy.<br> Oh, I do beg your pardon.<br> I am very sorry.<br> Do come in, ladies.<br> I'm very sorry about the mess.<br> I'm off in a couple of days.<br> Business, I'm afraid...<br> to Germany, uh, France,<br> and Italy.<br> Here's my card.<br> But my real love is the, uh...<br> oboe.<br> Do you play anything?<br> The pianoforte.<br> That's a ticket to the opera,<br> Mr. Briggs.<br> I do beg your pardon.<br> I played the flute when<br> I was at school.<br> I've always thought of myself<br> as a fluty kind of person.<br> Mr. Briggs...<br> Sixty pounds.<br> Oh, in cash.<br> Well, uh, Mrs. Arbuthnot,<br> checks are more usual, but, uh...<br> however, I'm richer, and you're<br> happier. I've got<br> the money, and you've got<br> San Salvatore,<br> and I think I know<br> which is best.<br> Well, um...<br> now, here are<br> all the details.<br> Yes, there we are.<br> Plus...<br> photographs.<br> There we are.<br> And the spare key...<br> and I'll give you a receipt.<br> Your, um...<br> your husband is going<br> with you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?<br> No.<br> No. I'm... I'm sorry.<br> I'd no right to...<br> I do understand.<br> sad times...<br> the war...<br> Thank you, Mr. Briggs.<br> Well, I think you'll fit in<br> very well at San Salvatore.<br> There are several portraits<br> of you on the walls.<br> Portraits of me?<br> Madonnas... exactly like you,<br> Mrs. Arbuthnot.<br> Are they looking disappointed?<br> No more than usual.<br> Rose.<br> Rose, we've done it!<br> We've done it!<br> You would've thought that<br> hundreds would have jumped<br> at the chance of sharing a month's<br> peace and quiet in San Salvatore.<br> I can't understand why<br> we've only had two replies.<br> It doesn't leave us much choice.<br> I knew them all, you know.<br> Dear Alfred Tennyson,<br> who pulled my pigtails<br> and said they were too long.<br> And I sat on Mr. Carlyle's knee.<br> Oh, how he scowled.<br> I'm a perfect sharer of your<br> holiday, Mrs. Arbuthnot.<br> All I wish to do is sit<br> in the shade<br> and remember better times<br> and better men.<br> I'm very fond of flowers, too,<br> and from what you tell me<br> in your advertisement,<br> San Salvatore will be perfect.<br> I remember spending a weekend<br> with my father at Box Hill.<br> Who lived at Box Hill?<br> George Meredith... the novelist.<br> Did you know Keats?<br> Keats?<br> No, I didn't,<br> and I didn't know Shakespeare<br> or Chaucer either.<br> Oh, no, of course not.<br> It's just that, um...<br> ...it's just that they're<br> immortal, aren't they?<br> And I've always thought<br> of immortals as being...<br> um, well... immortal -<br> not having died.<br> I mean, they're alive, but<br> they're dead... and... and alive.<br> It's... it's odd.<br> Very odd.<br> I thought I saw Keats<br> the other day in Hampstead<br> crossing the road to<br> his house where he lived.<br> It was about teatime...<br> Well, Mrs. Fisher,<br> time we were going.<br> I really did see him,<br> he was dressed in...<br> I hope you're not in the habit<br> of seeing dead people,<br> however distinguished.<br> It's not in the best of taste.<br> I'm sure the last thing<br> I would want to see<br> is my late husband, Mr. Fisher<br> crossing the road<br> in front of my house.<br> I'm sure.<br> Well, Mrs. Fisher, everything<br> seems in order.<br> Provided your references<br> are satisfactory.<br> I don't think references are very<br> nice things amongst decent people<br> I mean, we're not<br> business men are we?<br> They have to distrust<br> each other.<br> Mrs. Watkins is right, Mrs. Fisher.<br> References do bring a certain...<br> atmosphere into our plans<br> which isn't... quite what<br> we want,<br> so I don't think we'll take<br> up yours,<br> or give you ours.<br> In which case I shall assume<br> you don't wish to join us.<br> Well, very well.<br> No references.<br> Yeah, I waive all references.<br> There... forgive me if<br> I don't see you out.<br> Lady Caroline Dester.<br> Ooh, she sounds very grand.<br> Very smart.<br> Do you see her with us<br> at San Salvatore?<br> I'm Caroline Dester.<br> I'm Mrs. Arbuthnot,<br> and this is Mrs. Wilkins.<br> How do you do?<br> Do sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> You realize it will be very<br> quiet at San Salvatore.<br> Nothing. No one.<br> Just the waves.<br> It sounds like heaven.<br> I'll be in Italy, which I love,<br> and not in a hotel, which a loathe.<br> The nicest of all, I won't be staying<br> with friends, I'll be with strangers.<br> Wonderful.<br> Why is that so wonderful?<br> Well, you won't be able to<br> mentionI a single person I know.<br> You don't know anyone<br> I know, do you?<br> No, I don't think so.<br> Nor do I.<br> Good. It's so boring otherwise.<br> It's no holiday to talk about the<br> same old things, same old people.<br> I want to just sit and not talk<br> and not think and not be the<br> center of everything all the time.<br> You know what that's like.<br> No, I don't.<br> Neither do I.<br> Well, it's very wearing.<br> Everybody makes demands...<br> especially men.<br> Yes.<br> I'm not sure if you<br> really deserve it.<br> And this one I have inscribed<br> with a personal message for you.<br> Oh, thank you so much.<br> Now, I would rather<br> like you to meet...<br> Excuse me, I'm just going to<br> have a word with your daughter.<br> Gerald.<br> Congratulations on the book.<br> Thank you, Caroline.<br> Your mother has been most<br> generous in setting this up.<br> You look lovely.<br> I know. Thank you, Gerald.<br> You mustn't monopolize<br> Caroline.<br> It isn't fair.<br> Even though you are the<br> guest of honor, Mr. Arundal.<br> You're going away, I hear.<br> Who's been talking?<br> - Authors have ways.<br> - Was it mother?<br> My lips are sealed.<br> I need to get away.<br> Where are you going?<br> If I told you, I wouldn't be<br> getting away, would I.<br> It's a secret, is it?<br> And please don't try<br> and find out, Gerald.<br> No, no.<br> Why don't you go home?<br> I just must have some time alone.<br> Frederick?<br> Good night, my dear.<br> Splendid, my dear.<br> The apricot tart<br> was especially fine.<br> Mellersh!<br> There's something<br> I want to talk to you about.<br> There's something I want to<br> talk to you, too, about, my dear.<br> I'm thinking of taking<br> you to Italy for Easter.<br> What?<br> I'm thinking of taking you<br> to Italy for Easter.<br> We could both do with a change.<br> It would be nice to go together.<br> A second person is always useful<br> in a country whose language<br> one doesn't speak...<br> to look after the luggage while<br> one communicates with the natives.<br> You seem stunned, my dear.<br> I am.<br> Yes, well, you don't seem<br> very enthusiastic about it.<br> It... it really is the most<br> extraordinary coincidence, Mellersh.<br> Really extraordinary.<br> You see... I've been invited<br> by a friend<br> to spend April with her in Italy.<br> She has a house there.<br> What?<br> Well, a kind of castle, really...<br> so I said yes.<br> This is outrageous, Lottie.<br> You accepted an invitation from<br> a friend without consulting me?<br> I'm consulting you, now!<br> Well, you can write to her<br> and say you can't go...<br> It's simply out of the question!<br> - I can't do that!<br> - Why not!<br> Because I don't want to!<br> I'm afraid it's all settled,<br> Mellersh.<br> I can't go back on my word now.<br> Nothing's settled. I don't believe<br> a word of it.<br> A friend with a castle in Italy?<br> What friend?<br> You haven't got any friends,<br> as far as I know.<br> Rose Arbuthnot.<br> Rose Arbut... I never heard<br> of Rose Arbuthnot!<br> She's very nice.<br> Everybody says so.<br> Tell me if you'd like another<br> helping of apricot tart.<br> No, I would not like another<br> helping of apricot tart!<br> Lottie, you are not<br> going to Italy alone.<br> Absolutely not!<br> How is this different?<br> Well, this is Italian rain.<br> There's no one here to meet us.<br> We are four hours late.<br> Stop, thief!<br> Madame...<br> Madame... English madame!<br> San Salvatore?<br> San Salvatore!<br> San Salvato...<br> It's all right!<br> They must have sent it!<br> What?<br> Madame... English madame,<br> San Salvatore?<br> My horsey good horsey.<br> Buono! Buono!<br> We're in God's hands now.<br> We have no choice, Lottie.<br> Do you suppose it's all real?<br> Were you ever in your<br> whole life so happy?<br> Never.<br> I promised myself the first thing to<br> happen in this place would be a kiss.<br> Oh, it's a mirage.<br> No, it's her.<br> Oh, I didn't know she'd<br> arrived already.<br> Neither did I.<br> She'll get a headache, sitting in<br> the sun like that without a hat.<br> She's treading on lilies.<br> Well, they're hers as much<br> as ours.<br> Only a quarter of them.<br> - Hello!<br> - Hello.<br> I got here yesterday.<br> Oh, what a pity.<br> We were going to choose<br> the nicest room for you.<br> Oh, I've already done that.<br> At least, I think it's the nicest.<br> We were going to make it pretty<br> for you with lots of flowers.<br> Domenico's done that.<br> I told him when I got here.<br> He's the gardener.<br> Well, it's good to be independent<br> and to know exactly wha one wants.<br> Oh, it saves time.<br> But, you shouldn't be too independent<br> that people have no chance to be generous.<br> You know, I hadn't realized<br> you were so pretty.<br> That's very kind of you to say so.<br> You're really quite lovely.<br> I hope you make the most of it.<br> Yes, I've been making the most of it<br> ever since I can remember.<br> Because it won't last.<br> I know.<br> I musn't miss breakfast.<br> Buon giorno.<br> Oh, there you are.<br> Oh, we had no idea you<br> were here.<br> Oh, yes, I'm here.<br> Cuckoos.<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> I was just thinking about cuckoos<br> for some reason.<br> Uh, tea or coffee?<br> Uh, Lady Caroline's Italian<br> is much better than mine.<br> My Italian is the Italian of Dante.<br> Very old-fashioned.<br> I..<br> I was taught it by<br> Mr. Robert Browning.<br> Wonderful.<br> London doesn't exist anymore.<br> I suppose you realize<br> we've got to heaven.<br> Oh, grazie.<br> Well, I intend to spend most<br> of my time reading by myself.<br> Nobody wants to see an old<br> woman hobbling about everywhere.<br> Oh, I do hope your bedroom<br> is comfortable.<br> Oh, very quiet.<br> It had two beds in it for some<br> reason, so I had one taken out.<br> Oh, so that's why I've got<br> two beds.<br> I've got two beds as well.<br> The second one must be<br> Lady Caroline's.<br> We simply asked Francesca<br> to take them out.<br> We didn't need them.<br> Neither do we.<br> Do we, Rose?<br> Our husbands aren't here<br> to put in them.<br> In my day, husbands and beds were<br> rarely spoken of in the same breath.<br> Husbands were taken seriously,<br> as the only real obstacle to sin.<br> Would you like some more<br> coffee, Mrs. Arbuthnot?<br> Uh... no, thank you.<br> Would you?<br> No.<br> Now, have you all you want?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Have you?<br> Mrs. Arbuthnot...<br> you have the most interesting<br> habit of answering a question<br> with the same question.<br> Oh, no, no.<br> Don't apologize.<br> I wasn't going to.<br> Well.<br> I'd better get on with my duties.<br> What time would you like lunch?<br> Lunch is at half past 12:00.<br> Oh, I'll tell cook.<br> It'll be a struggle, but I've<br> bought a little dictionary.<br> The cook knows.<br> Lady Caroline has already told her.<br> She speaks the sort of Italian<br> cooks understand.<br> I couldn't get into the kitchen<br> because of my stick.<br> Grazie.<br> I just want to get my feathers<br> smooth again.<br> Not spoken to, not grabbed.<br> If I can be left quiet for<br> one month,<br> forget things...<br> I might be able to get<br> myself straight.<br> I've wasted so much time<br> being beautiful.<br> Not on of them here.<br> Lax. Lax.<br> Uh, are you all right?<br> Yes.<br> Did you hear the gong?<br> Yes.<br> I have a headache.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> Perhaps some tea might do<br> you good.<br> No. I expect she wants<br> to be left quiet.<br> Yes.<br> But, I can't bear to think of you<br> out here with a headache.<br> What she really wants<br> is to be left alone.<br> May I have the bread, please?<br> Do you know the Italian<br> for "aspirin"?<br> The proper cure for<br> headaches is castor oil.<br> She hasn't got a headache.<br> Carlyle suffered terribly<br> from headaches and neuralgia.<br> He always took castor oil.<br> What Lady Caroline wants is a dose.<br> Only one, mind.<br> It's a mistake to keep<br> on taking castor oil.<br> Do you know the Italian for it?<br> No, I don't think I do.<br> Castor oil isn't in classical Italian.<br> She hasn't got a headache.<br> Then why, pray, should she<br> say she has, Mrs. Wilkins?<br> Oh, she's... she's just<br> trying to be polite.<br> Soon she won't have<br> to try... she'll...<br> She'll just be<br> herself without trying.<br> Lottie has a theory about this place.<br> I'm sure,<br> but I don't understand why you assume<br> Lady Caroline is not telling the truth.<br> I don't assume. I know.<br> And how, pray, do you know?<br> I saw inside her.<br> I hear you're not well.<br> I expect the journey's upset you.<br> Now, what you need is<br> a good dose<br> of some simple medicine<br> like castor oil.<br> Ah, I thought you weren't asleep.<br> Now, take my advice.<br> Don't neglect what might<br> turn into an illness.<br> This is Italy.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I'm just lying here thinking.<br> Well, that's dangerous, too.<br> I should go to bed and get well.<br> I am well.<br> Then why did you send<br> a message saying you were ill?<br> I didn't.<br> Then I have had all the trouble<br> of coming out here for nothing.<br> Yes, but don't you prefer<br> coming out<br> and finding me well than<br> coming out and finding me ill?<br> Isn't this a delightful room?<br> We've just discovered it.<br> Well, really.<br> Why don't you like us<br> being here?<br> I should have thought you<br> could see.<br> This is my room.<br> The notepaper.<br> That's my notepaper.<br> And the pen.<br> It's yours?<br> I'm very sorry. I...<br> I've been writing some<br> very nice things with it.<br> I don't think I hurt it in any way.<br> But why can't we be here?<br> This is a sitting room,<br> and we've been sitting.<br> There's another one.<br> You and your friend can't<br> sit in two rooms at once?<br> If I've no with to disturb you in yours,<br> you shouldn't don't disturb me in mine.<br> It's all right.<br> Soon you'll want us to share.<br> You'll probably even ask me<br> to use your pen if I haven't one.<br> I need a room to myself.<br> I'm an old woman.<br> I can't get about because<br> of my stick.<br> I have to sit.<br> I want somewhere where<br> I won't be disturbed.<br> Mrs. Fisher, I assure you,<br> we have no intention-<br> We're only too glad for you to have<br> this room if it makes you happy.<br> We just didn't know about it,<br> that's all.<br> We wouldn't have come<br> in if we had...<br> not until you invited us, anyway,<br> and you probably will do,<br> you know... very soon.<br> It isn't her room.<br> I've been thinking about Mellersh.<br> Why?<br> I've been a mean dog.<br> A... a what?<br> All this coming away and leaving<br> him in that dreary place<br> while I'm here enjoying<br> myself in heaven.<br> You know, he planned a holiday<br> in Italy with me,<br> and I planned a holiday<br> in Italy by myself.<br> I think he must be very hurt.<br> I've written and told<br> him everything.<br> You mean about the advertisement<br> and your nest egg?<br> Oh, no.<br> I'll tell him about that<br> when he comes.<br> Uh, oh, when he comes?<br> I've written and<br> invited him to stay.<br> It's the least i could do.<br> It would be mean<br> not to share all this.<br> You think he'll come?<br> Oh, I hope so, poor lamb.<br> I see him here.<br> Lottie.<br> Lottie, I can't keep up.<br> The whole idea about coming<br> here was to get away,<br> wasn't it?<br> And now after just one day,<br> you want to write<br> to the very people...<br> the very people we're<br> trying to get away from.<br> Yes, I know.<br> It's idiotic, isn't it, Rose? But...<br> I feel so happy here.<br> This place makes me<br> feel flooded with love.<br> The important thing is<br> to have lots of love about.<br> I was very stingy<br> with it back home.<br> I used to measure<br> and count it out.<br> I had this obsession<br> with justice, you see.<br> I wouldn't love Mellersh unless<br> he loved me back exactly as much.<br> And as he didn't,<br> neither did I.<br> The emptiness of it all.<br> I don't think I'll come<br> down to the village.<br> I'd like to stay here and think.<br> Don't think too long.<br> Write and invite him now.<br> Invite who?<br> Your husband!<br> Lottie can write, and<br> Mellersh will answer.<br> Frederick won't.<br> Or if he did, it would be,<br> "thanks for the letter.<br> Don't hurry back.<br> Say if you want money.<br> Frederick. "<br> That's a beautiful dress.<br> No. I've had it a hundred years.<br> But you must be very cold in it.<br> It's easy to catch<br> a chill here after dark.<br> You look as though you have<br> nothing on underneath.<br> I haven't.<br> That's very imprudent<br> and very improper.<br> There are no men here,<br> so how can it be improper?<br> Have you noticed how difficult it is to<br> be improper when there are no men about.<br> That's sad, but true.<br> I've had a wonderful day.<br> I've decided to invite<br> someone to stay here.<br> - What?<br> - I think he'll like it.<br> - Who?<br> - Wilkins.<br> - Well, that's your name.<br> - And his.<br> A relation?<br> A husband.<br> I thought you were<br> a war widow.<br> Why?<br> There are so many of them about.<br> When we were in London,<br> we agreed that we could invite<br> one guest each, didn't we?<br> I don't remember that.<br> I do, but it's incredible<br> you should want to.<br> I thought the whole idea was<br> to get away from one's friends...<br> - and husbands.<br> - And family affection.<br> - And lack of family affection.<br> - Really...<br> It wouldn't be so bad. It would give<br> a person room to breathe.<br> No. It would be terrible,<br> like having no clothes on.<br> - I like that.<br> - Really!<br> It's a good feeling,<br> getting rid of things.<br> But it's so cold having<br> nothing on,<br> and knowing that you'll never<br> have anything on again.<br> You're going to get colder<br> and colder<br> until, at last, you die of it.<br> That's what it's like living with<br> someone who doesn't love you.<br> Would you pass me the cream?<br> But doesn't he love you?<br> Mellersh? He shows no signs of it.<br> Delicious.<br> Oh, really.<br> I didn't think it was delicious.<br> I was miserable, and then,<br> today, I got well.<br> I can't ever be happy<br> shutting him out.<br> I must share.<br> Now I know exactly what<br> the blessed damozel felt like.<br> - Who's the blessed damozel?<br> - It's a poem.<br> I'll lend you a copy.<br> Please, don't.<br> And the author, Mr. Rosetti,<br> though not all one would wish,<br> was frequently invited to<br> my father's house.<br> How terrible for you.<br> That's what my mother's always<br> doing, inviting authors.<br> I hate authors, don't you?<br> Me?<br> - Well, sometimes.<br> - I wouldn't mind them so much<br> if they didn't write books.<br> Do go on about Mellersh.<br> Oh, really.<br> Well, it's all these beds.<br> Eight beds and only four people.<br> That's dreadful.<br> I want Rose to invite<br> her husband here, too.<br> - Really.<br> - Really!<br> Sorry.<br> You do realize, of course,<br> there is only one spare<br> bedroom in the house.<br> One?<br> Who's in all the others?<br> We are.<br> There are six rooms.<br> We have four.<br> Francesca has the fifth,<br> and the sixth is empty.<br> Oh, dear. Oh, dear.<br> I want to love Mellersh, but<br> not necessarily spend<br> every night with him.<br> Where am I going to put him?<br> - Isn't one room enough for him?<br> - Yes, but...<br> then there won't be room for<br> anyone that you want to invite.<br> Well, I shan't want to.<br> No?<br> And Rose doesn't count.<br> She'd want to share<br> her room with her husband.<br> It's written all over her.<br> Lottie!<br> Really!<br> Really, what?<br> Just, really,<br> Am I to understand<br> you propose to reserve<br> the only spare bedroom<br> for the exclusive use<br> of your family?<br> Mellersh isn't my family.<br> He's my husband.<br> Well, as nobody seems to want<br> the room, Mellersh must have it.<br> I have a friend.<br> Kate Lumley.<br> Perhaps you know her?<br> I wish to invite her to join me.<br> That settles Mellersh, then.<br> Afraid you're in for it, Lottie,<br> unless, of course, he can't come.<br> No, no.<br> I... I see him here.<br> Why am I so restless?<br> I haven't felt this restless<br> since I was a child.<br> It's too absurd for<br> someone my age.<br> But look at me.<br> I can't keep still.<br> I feel... something is<br> going to happen.<br> But I won't let it.<br> I won't let it.<br> It's odd how one's mind slips<br> sideways in a place like this.<br> I walked without my stick today.<br> It's very strange.<br> If you knew me,<br> you'd know how strange it was.<br> You can talk to your Kate Lumley<br> about that when she comes.<br> Oh, no.<br> Kate would only look at me<br> and suggest a cup of tea.<br> I'm starving.<br> I've had another wonderful day.<br> Has the letter gone?<br> What letter's that?<br> Inviting her husband here.<br> Oh, Lottie, don't.<br> Another one?<br> Who is her husband?<br> Mr. Arbuthnot, of course.<br> I mean what is Mr. Arbuthnot?<br> My husband.<br> They bring tra-la,<br> a summer of roses and wine,<br> a summer of roses and wine.<br> And that's what we mean<br> when we say that the thing<br> is welcome as flowers<br> that bloom in the spring...<br> Caroline's right.<br> Minds slip sideways.<br> How could I invite him?<br> What would we talk about?<br> The truth is...<br> I bore him.<br> And there's no way back.<br> No. If you bore somebody,<br> it's almost impossible<br> to unbore him.<br> Is that Lady Caroline Dester?<br> No.<br> Rose. Mrs. Arbuthnot.<br> Caroline'll still be in bed.<br> Caroline?<br> You call her Caroline?<br> I must say, Lottie, when<br> I got your letter<br> and found you were on holiday<br> with Lady Caroline Dester<br> I was impressed.<br> Isn't it beautiful here,<br> Mellersh?<br> You know the Desters are one<br> of the richest families in England?<br> For once, Lottie,<br> you're being really useful.<br> The air is golden.<br> Now, first I think<br> I'll have a bath,<br> then a shave, then change my clothes,<br> have a sleep, and then I'll lunch.<br> Then you can introduce me<br> to Lady Caroline Dester.<br> I've planned exactly<br> what I'm going to say.<br> Mellersh, I do believe you came<br> all this way just to see Lady Caroline<br> and not me.<br> No. No, my dear.<br> No, no, no.<br> No. I came here to see you.<br> Oh, yes.<br> If, however, in so doing,<br> I can improve our business<br> prospects,<br> well...<br> Oh, I don't mind.<br> You're here.<br> That's the important thing.<br> And you'll change.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you.<br> Out. Out.<br> I can wash myself,<br> Thank you very much indeed.<br> That'll be all.<br> Thank you.<br> There you are.<br> Thank you.<br> That'll be all.<br> Blast that bloody bath!<br> - Oh, my god.<br> - How do you do?<br> How do you do?<br> I'm Caroline Dester.<br> A.. allow me<br> to introduce myself.<br> My name's Mellersh Wilkins.<br> I'm... I'm afraid I used<br> unpardonable language.<br> I thought it most appropriate<br> in the circumstances.<br> Mrs. Fisher,<br> allow me to introduce<br> Mr. Mellersh Wilkins.<br> This is Mrs. Fisher.<br> Always a pleasure to meet<br> a friend of my wife's.<br> I... I was just taking a bath.<br> Oh, I didn't know<br> 'pericoloso' meant explosion.<br> Otherwise, I would've<br> remained dirty.<br> Oh, but now, Mellersh,<br> you look absolutely spotless.<br> You look clean enough<br> to eat dinner off.<br> Lady Caroline acted with true grace.<br> And Mrs. Fisher is remarkable,<br> too, in her way.<br> A woman of parts<br> and property, if I'm not mistaken,<br> who may need my counseling.<br> Lottie, your friends are splendid.<br> Splendid.<br> Why you kept them<br> a secret is beyond me.<br> Signora, signora.<br> Does this good Lady<br> want something?<br> - Money.<br> - Money?<br> I think she's talking about<br> the housekeeping bills.<br> You've nothing to do with<br> those. You're a guest here.<br> I'm afraid I'm not.<br> The four of us are sharing<br> the expense of this holiday.<br> I'm paying for my share<br> out of my nest egg.<br> You've every right<br> to be angry with me.<br> Nonsense.<br> Well... it's your money,<br> after all.<br> And you needed<br> a holiday like this.<br> Where else would you meet<br> such interesting people?<br> Oh, Mellersh, you really<br> are sweet.<br> Mellersh, you belong here.<br> This is the result of one week's<br> unbridled license, and it must stop.<br> Mr. Wilkins, I don't approve<br> of men smoking indoors.<br> I thought you wouldn't.<br> I'm looking for that<br> Lady Caroline girl.<br> Ah, a most agreeable guest.<br> Agreeable?<br> She's been letting the bills run<br> up in a most terrible fashion.<br> What has Lady Caroline<br> to do with the bills?<br> The housekeeping was left to her.<br> Lady Caroline housekeeping for<br> a party that includes my wife?<br> You render me speechless.<br> You do know she's the daughter<br> of Lord Dester...<br> the Lord Dester.<br> Ah! That accounts for it then.<br> The botch-up her father<br> made in his department<br> during the war was<br> a national scandal.<br> They never could actually<br> prove anything.<br> You ought to have told me you<br> were not doing the household bills.<br> I didn't know you thought I was.<br> What do you propose we do<br> for the rest of the time here?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing. Uh. uh. Nothing!<br> Uh, ladies...<br> May I make a suggestion?<br> Why not allow a certain<br> amount per head,<br> and tell the cook from that sum she<br> must cater for you as well as ever.<br> It's easily reckoned out.<br> The charges of a modest<br> hotel perhaps... halved.<br> Well, that's very sensible,<br> Mr. Wilkins.<br> Oh, it is, but..<br> but what about the terrifying bills<br> or this last week?<br> Don't worry. I'll pay them.<br> It'll be my present to<br> San Salvatore,<br> and I don't want Lottie<br> worried in any way.<br> That is most generous of you.<br> Well, uh, if you wish<br> to waste<br> your money, I agree.<br> Good.<br> Well, we needn't bother<br> Lady Caroline any further.<br> - Oh, really.<br> - Mrs. Fisher,<br> do tell me about Ruskin.<br> I like him.<br> I didn't think I would,<br> but I do.<br> He doesn't hover.<br> He doesn't grab.<br> He fits in.<br> I shouldn't write.<br> He won't come.<br> "What do I want with a holiday?"<br> This place is making me soft,<br> and work is the only salvation.<br> You know I won't post it.<br> Domenico can do it.<br> Mellersh?<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> I've made up my mind.<br> I've decided to pay your expenses<br> for this holiday, as well as my own.<br> Your nest egg...<br> will not be touched.<br> Oh, Mellersh.<br> - How nice of you.<br> - Careful, careful.<br> Now, I realize how valuable<br> you are to me.<br> In my profession...<br> a man is always helped<br> by having<br> a clever and... attractive wife.<br> Lady Caroline thinks<br> you're attractive.<br> And so do I.<br> Do you think I'm attractive,<br> Mellersh?<br> Yes, I do.<br> One thing puzzles me, though.<br> Why weren't you attractive sooner?<br> I've been lucky.<br> All the advantages<br> I was born with,<br> and I've misused them.<br> Perhaps if Jack hadn't been killed.<br> No, no.<br> That's an excuse.<br> Thousands of women<br> lost men in the war.<br> I should count my blessings.<br> So why aren't I satisfied?<br> I have it all.<br> Why can't I hold onto it?<br> He'll have got your<br> letter by now.<br> I shouldn't have sent it.<br> Oh, no.<br> You'll get a message very<br> soon<br> saying he's on his way.<br> It works for you.<br> You have a gift for happiness.<br> Ahh, Mrs. Arbuthnot...<br> I was looking for you.<br> There's a telegram.<br> Rose?<br> Not bad news, I trust?<br> No, no.<br> On the contrary.<br> "I am passing on way to Rome.<br> Will pay my respects. "<br> And who is George Briggs?<br> The owner. It's his house.<br> He's coming this afternoon.<br> He's very nice.<br> Mr. Briggs.<br> Oh. We didn't expect<br> you so soon.<br> Yes, it really is extraordinary,<br> the likeness.<br> Oh, well, I hope I don't look<br> quite so solemn.<br> It isn't really so much like me.<br> Well, I can see deeper than<br> most. You're alike inside.<br> You and Lottie should<br> get on very well.<br> She sees inside people, too.<br> La Signora Fisher...<br> Who's Signora Fisher?<br> One of the four of us<br> who are sharing your house.<br> Four?<br> Well, my friend and I decided<br> we couldn't afford it on our own, so...<br> Oh, dear. If I had known.<br> Come on. I'll introduce<br> you to Mrs. Fisher.<br> No. Won't she keep?<br> Won't you show me around first?<br> - It's your house.<br> - Well, no, it's not.<br> Well, until Monday week.<br> Come on, you show me all your<br> views, and I'll show you mine.<br> Careful, now. Here.<br> Ah, there we are.<br> What?<br> Why are you laughing?<br> Well, it's like coming home.<br> Oh, but this is your home.<br> No. I mean like coming<br> home to a family.<br> I've never had a family, you see.<br> I'm an orphan.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> I hope you haven't<br> been one long. I...<br> no, I mean, well...<br> I don't know what I mean.<br> No. I... I was adopted.<br> Happily.<br> But I always missed...<br> having a family.<br> And there's something about you<br> that's exactly my idea of a family.<br> You're so...<br> warm.<br> Well, you wouldn't think so<br> if you saw my house in London.<br> There's nothing warm there.<br> Why,... not at all.<br> I'd believe any place you lived<br> in would be exactly like you.<br> You're not going to tell me<br> that San Salvatore is like me?<br> Well, of course.<br> I mean, you must admit<br> it's beautiful.<br> Here.<br> I've been thinking.<br> Isn't it better to feel young<br> somewhere<br> than old everywhere?<br> Time enough to feel old again<br> when we have to leave<br> this beautiful place.<br> Oh, good gracious.<br> Child,<br> Child.<br> Excuse me. Do you...<br> you remember me?<br> Yes, of course, Mr. Briggs.<br> Hello.<br> Yes, you must have some tea.<br> I'll get Francesca to make<br> some fresh.<br> Oh, well, No.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I'm forgetting myself.<br> - Oh, it's very natural.<br> I... I'll go along<br> and ask Francesca.<br> Oh, no. No, don't you go.<br> Um, uh, Francesca,<br> ancora te, Francesca.<br> I was, uh, explaining,<br> Mrs. Wilkins,<br> that I'm just on my way<br> to Rome, and, um...<br> I thought I'd just look in and<br> make sure you were all comfortable.<br> And where are you staying,<br> Mr. Briggs?<br> At a hotel at Mezzago.<br> Well, no.<br> You must stay here.<br> It's your home.<br> You can have Kate Lumley's<br> room.<br> You wouldn't mind him<br> using it<br> for one night, would you,<br> Mrs. Fisher?<br> Kate Lumley isn't actually in it.<br> No, she isn't.<br> Uh, Kate Lumley is unfortunately<br> a very wide person,<br> and that's a very narrow room.<br> No. Kate might get into it,<br> but once in, she would<br> probably never get out.<br> So, you see, dear boy,<br> you must stay here.<br> Yes, you must.<br> Well, if you all agree,<br> I'd love to be a guest here,<br> especially with three such<br> lovely hostesses.<br> Uh, but there is a fourth,<br> isn't there?<br> Uh... yes.<br> You can ask her yourself,<br> Mr. Briggs.<br> Caroline, this is Mr. Briggs,<br> the owner.<br> We've invited him<br> to stay the night.<br> - Yes, if there's room and...<br> - Oh, Lord, another man.<br> Looks like a grabber.<br> Grab, grab, grab.<br> There's Kate Lumley's room.<br> She's not coming,<br> is she, Mrs. Fisher?<br> Well, not if I can help it.<br> Then I join in the invitation.<br> Well, thank you.<br> So we'll have another whole day to<br> explore San Salvatore, i f you'll let me.<br> I'd be delighted.<br> Good.<br> Could you give me some<br> of those cherries, my dear?<br> You'd better get your things,<br> Mr. Briggs.<br> Oh, yes... uh<br> Oh, we can easily<br> send Domenico.<br> Well, only if you're sure it wouldn't<br> be any trouble, Mrs. Arbuthnot.<br> Mr. Briggs...<br> Do tell Caroline<br> about the oleander tree.<br> Oh, well...<br> yes, um...<br> uh, yes, you see this, uh,<br> oleander just here.<br> Well, my father...<br> uh, many years ago...<br> stuck his cherry-wood walking<br> stick into... uh...<br> that spot, and said to the head gardener,<br> "this is where we'll have an oleander. "<br> And he left it there<br> as a reminder,<br> and, uh, after a while,<br> uh, quite how long<br> nobody can be sure,<br> it the stick began to sprout.<br> And it was...<br> an oleander.<br> Is that true?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> It's such a pretty story.<br> Yes, it is.<br> He seemed very taken<br> with Rose.<br> He certainly didn't grab<br> like the rest of them.<br> I'm pleased.<br> Yes, I'm very pleased.<br> Of course I'm pleased.<br> Gerald?<br> Gerald Arundel. It can't be.<br> Oh, my goodness.<br> Caroline...<br> I didn't expect...<br> What are you doing here?<br> You must forgive me<br> dear Caroline.<br> Your mother told me<br> where you were.<br> As I happened to be passing<br> on my way to Rome,<br> I thought I'd get out at Mezzago<br> and just look in,...<br> see how you were...<br> if that's all right.<br> Didn't Mother tell you<br> I was having a rest cure?<br> Yes, she did.<br> That's why I didn't come earlier.<br> Left it till near dinnertime.<br> Didn't want to intrude.<br> I thought you might be bored.<br> I'm not.<br> I do apologize<br> for barging in like this.<br> No, no. I'm rather<br> glad to see you.<br> Tell me all about Mother.<br> She's taken to wearing a wig.<br> A wig?<br> Blond.<br> She looks rather like<br> Brunhilda.<br> I must run, or I'll never<br> be ready in time.<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I'd just like to have a sit<br> after that walk.<br> See you at dinner?<br> Frederick?<br> Rose.<br> I knew you'd come.<br> When did you start?<br> Start? Yesterday morning.<br> You started right away then.<br> Right away, yes.<br> You got my letter very<br> quickly, didn't you?<br> Your letter?<br> Very quick.<br> Sweetheart...<br> I'm so glad you came.<br> Oh, I am sorry. I...<br> I didn't mean to...<br> Mr. Briggs.<br> Well, I'm damned.<br> This is my husband...<br> Frederick Arbuthnot.<br> I thought you were widow.<br> No. Why?<br> Well, no, I thought, um...<br> well, so many women<br> seem to be...<br> Frederick, this is Mr. Briggs.<br> He owns the castle.<br> - How do you do?<br> - Oh, how do...<br> well, um...<br> We'd better go on.<br> come on.<br> We mustn't be late for dinner.<br> Not like Caroline.<br> - Caroline?<br> - Caroline?<br> Lady Caroline Dester.<br> She's one of my friends.<br> Are you all right, dear?<br> Never better.<br> Of course, Mrs. Fisher,<br> it would be<br> undoubtedly best if one's<br> outward appearance<br> and one's feelings matched,<br> but so often they don't.<br> One can't have everything.<br> I, for example...<br> I am at the moment<br> feeling happy... joyful, even.<br> But do I show it?<br> I kept telling Rose you'd come,<br> didn't I, Rose?<br> You did.<br> I didn't believe it,<br> but here you are.<br> You're right, Lottie.<br> It's this place.<br> It's a tub of love.<br> What?<br> A tub of love.<br> Ah, this is Caroline.<br> I'm Frederick Arbuthnot.<br> Frederick Arbuthnot.<br> My name's Frederick Arbuthnot.<br> I'm Rose's husband.<br> I've just come down to see her.<br> Yes, yes, yes. Hmm.<br> How nice.<br> And I'm late on your very<br> first evening.<br> Do forgive me.<br> Isn't she beautiful?<br> Love...<br> yes.<br> You know, it's a great thing<br> to get on with one's loving...<br> and not to waste time.<br> I suppose you think<br> Rose's husband is just<br> a middle-aged, red-faced,<br> rather ordinary man.<br> He isn't.<br> Isn't he?<br> No.<br> Rose sees through all that.<br> She sees what we can't see<br> because she loves him.<br> Oh, dear Lottie, we must be<br> friends forever and forever.<br> Thank you for not, uh...<br> I don't know what you mean,<br> Mr. Arbuthnot.<br> I think Rose is waiting for you.<br> Oh, hello. Who's that?<br> It's me. Caroline Dester.<br> I hope I'm not disturbing you.<br> Oh, no. No.<br> Forgive me.<br> I couldn't help noticing<br> how miserable you seemed.<br> Was it the unexpected arrival<br> of Mr. Arbuthnot?<br> Uh, yes.<br> I thought Mr. Arbuthnot<br> had, uh, died.<br> Well, so many men died.<br> Yes. So many.<br> Yes. It's, um...<br> Well, you may not have noticed,<br> but I'm rather shortsighted.<br> - Indeed?<br> - Well, the war.<br> Does it give you any pain?<br> On, no, no.<br> Absolutely not. Nothing<br> to it at all, but it does<br> rather mean<br> I never get a...<br> a good look at people,<br> you know.<br> They all seem rather<br> hazy somehow.<br> I tend to judge people<br> by their voices, you know,<br> the inside person,<br> and it did rather seem to me<br> that Mrs. Arbuthnot was...<br> wonderful... inside.<br> Wonderful inside?<br> Yes.<br> That's important.<br> Yes.<br> Oh, what the devil.<br> It's too beautiful a night<br> to be miserable.<br> Though I do miss the stars.<br> - No!<br> - Sorry.<br> I had to grab you.<br> All my dead friends don't seem<br> worth reading tonight.<br> They always say the same things,<br> good things, but always the same.<br> They were... they are... great,<br> but they have one<br> terrible disadvantage<br> - they're all dead.<br> I'm tired of the dead.<br> I want the living.<br> Thank you, my dear.<br> I was feeling<br> a little melancholy.<br> Where are the others?<br> They all seem to have<br> paired off, Mrs. Fisher.<br> It does seem<br> that people can only<br> be happy in pairs,<br> all sorts of pairs.<br> Then you and I will be<br> a pair, Mrs. Fisher.<br> We're going to be very<br> good friends.<br> I hope so, Lottie.<br> I see it.<br> Then we will be.<br> Where exactly are the others?<br> Well, the Roses are in love<br> in the Rose garden.<br> The Roses?<br> Why not call them<br> the Arbuthnots, my dear?<br> Very well, Mellersh.<br> The Arbuthnots.<br> And the Carolines...<br> ...the who?<br> Oh, the Briggses, then.<br> The Briggses?<br> Oh, are you mad?<br> They never set eyes<br> on each other before today.<br> That's why they're<br> able to go ahead.<br> Go ahead?<br> It's no use, Mellersh.<br> I see them as the Briggses.<br> You coming, my dear?<br> It's so sad to leave here.<br> Lottie. Lottie, just<br> a moment, my dear.<br> - You go on.<br> - Are you sure?<br> You go on ahead, and<br> 'll join you presently.<br> All right. Mind your<br> step here.<br> Such a beautiful place.<br> Marvelous.<br> Mrs. Fisher!<br> Come on!<br> That last week,<br> the whole country seemed<br> to dress itself in white.<br> There were white lilies,<br> white stocks,<br> white banksia Roses,<br> and the fragrance of the acacias.<br> Even after we'd got to<br> the bottom of the hill<br> and passed through the iron<br> gates and out into the village,<br> we could still smell the acacias.<br> We could smell them even<br> when we reached London.<br> But that's another story.<br>
