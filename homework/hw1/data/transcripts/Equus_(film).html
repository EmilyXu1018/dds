Break it up. Come on!<br> Through this gate, into another<br> field. I couldn't see it,<br> but I knew I had to get through<br> that gate. If I could get through it,<br> then that was it,<br> I could see everything.<br> All right. All right.<br> Take one, Mary Ann.<br> I don't want one.<br> Mary Ann, come on.<br> Don't bother me.<br> You don't have to listen<br> to them all the time.<br> Oh, I know, but, uh...<br> - Why not?<br> - You want one, take one.<br> Stop being so ignorant!<br> All right. All right, now.<br> Settle down.<br> Sucking it up?<br> That's no good. Shall we smash it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> No.<br> No?<br> Come on, we'll smash it.<br> No.<br> All right, now. Now<br> pick up your right leg.<br> No.<br> Pick up your right leg, man.<br> Why?<br> Because you'd please me<br> a great deal if you did.<br> I said, "No"!<br> Come on. Up.<br> Now scream! Jab it! Louder. Go on!<br> Scream! Scream!<br> That's it.<br> It began one Monday,<br> some months ago,<br> with Hesther's visit.<br> Martin, I'm sorry. I should<br> have called first, I know.<br> Not at all.<br> You're a welcome relief.<br> Have a filthy coffee?<br> No, please, no.<br> It's really rather urgent.<br> Take a couch.<br> Martin, I've just come from the<br> most shocking case I ever tried.<br> My fellow magistrates wanted to<br> send him to prison on the spot.<br> I mean, luckily, I got him<br> remanded for a report.<br> Who's he?<br> A teenager. The name's Strang.<br> Ah.<br> What's he done? Dosed some little<br> girl's Pepsi with Spanish fly?<br> What could possibly have thrown your<br> court into such tory convulsions?<br> He...<br> Blinded 6 horses<br> with a metal spike.<br> - Blinded?<br> - Yes.<br> All at once, or over a period?<br> All at once, the night before last.<br> Where?<br> In a stable over at Chalk Ford.<br> He worked there on weekends.<br> What did he say in court?<br> Nothing. He just sang.<br> Sang?<br> Martin, you've simply<br> got to take him here.<br> You think this hospital is suitable?<br> How dangerous is he?<br> No, I mean, you, personally.<br> Now look, Hesther,<br> before you say anything else,<br> I can take no more patients at the moment.<br> I can't even cope with the ones I have.<br> - You must.<br> - Why?<br> Thank you. Oh, for... damn!<br> Hello, Pat?<br> Yes. Now, my advice is,<br> cancel her leave for a month.<br> See what difference that makes<br> to her dad. Yes, exactly.<br> Now, why?<br> Because there's no one else<br> within 100 miles of that desk<br> who can handle him, and perhaps<br> understand what this is all about.<br> The regular hospital will be useless,<br> and so will the other doctors here.<br> That's an absolutely<br> unwarrantable statement.<br> Well, it's true.<br> They'll be very cool<br> and professional,<br> and underneath, they'll be disgusted and<br> immovably English, just like my court.<br> Well, what am I? Polynesian?<br> Please, Martin.<br> This is the last favor<br> I'll ever ask of you.<br> - No, it's not.<br> - No, it's not.<br> I mean, he's obviously abominable.<br> I know that already.<br> Why me? Why, Hesther?<br> 'Cause there's something<br> extraordinary about him.<br> In what way?<br> Terrible, if you like.<br> I don't quite know what I'm saying.<br> I'm...<br> Just knew I had to come here.<br> Take him, Martin.<br> It's very important.<br> What did I expect of him?<br> Very little, I promise you.<br> One more dented little face.<br> One more adolescent freak.<br> The usual unusual.<br> Now, this room will<br> be completely yours.<br> No one will come in<br> without your say so.<br> There's a bell if<br> you need anything.<br> There's a lavatory down the<br> corridor, 2nd door on the left.<br> I think this is one<br> of the nicest rooms<br> in the whole place.<br> Don't you, Mr. Pearce?<br> Absolutely.<br> Sometimes, I blame Hesther.<br> She brought him to me.<br> But of course, that's nonsense.<br> What is he but a last straw?<br> A last symbol. That's all.<br> I was ripe for the confrontation.<br> Alan Strang, Doctor.<br> Ah, thank you.<br> Hello.<br> My name's, uh, Martin.<br> Yours is Alan.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> For today, I just want<br> a few simple facts.<br> Uh, is... is this your full name?<br> Alan Strang?<br> And you're 17, is that right? 17?<br> You work in an electrical shop<br> during the week.<br> Electrical and kitchenware.<br> Well?<br> Double Your Pleasure<br> Double your fun<br> With Double-good, Double-good<br> doublemint gum<br> Yes.<br> Now let's see, you live with your<br> parents, and your father's a printer.<br> What sort of things does he print?<br> Double Your Pleasure<br> Double your fun<br> With Double-good, Double-good<br> doublemint gum<br> I mean, does he do leaflets,<br> calendars? Things like that?<br> Try the taste of martini<br> The most beautiful<br> drink in the world<br> It's the bright one<br> The right one, that's martini<br> I wish you'd sit down if<br> you're going to sing.<br> Don't you think you'd<br> be more comfortable?<br> There's only one "T" in typhoo<br> In packets and in teabags, too<br> Any way you make it<br> You'll know that it's true<br> There's only one "T" in typhoo<br> That's a good song.<br> I like that better than the other two.<br> Sing that one again.<br> Double Your Pleasure<br> Double your fun<br> With Double-good, Double-good<br> Now, listen.<br> This is not a loony bin.<br> It's not a prison.<br> If you behave yourself, you'll<br> have a reasonably all right time.<br> If you don't, you'll be packed<br> off to a mental hospital,<br> and you'll find things<br> much more restricted.<br> So it's up to you.<br> You'll be seeing me every day.<br> Your session will last<br> exactly 45 minutes.<br> And I expect you to be<br> absolutely on time. All right?<br> By the way...<br> Which of your parents is it who won't<br> allow you to watch television?<br> Mother?<br> Father?<br> Or is it both?<br> Come in, David.<br> Uh, take Strang, here,<br> on a tour of the...<br> Hospital, before lunch.<br> You'll find it quite pleasant.<br> There's a piano room, a<br> darkroom for photographers,<br> even a television room.<br> this very specific dream.<br> In it, I am a chief<br> priest in Homeric Greece.<br> I'm wearing a wide gold mask,<br> all noble and bearded,<br> like the so-called mask of<br> Agamemnon, found at Mycenae.<br> I'm standing by a thick, round<br> stone, holding a sharp knife.<br> In fact, I'm officiating in some<br> immensely important<br> ritual sacrifice<br> on which depends the<br> fate of the crops,<br> or of a military expedition.<br> The sacrifice is a<br> herd of children,<br> about 500 boys and girls<br> stretching in a long queue,<br> across the plain of Argos.<br> I know it's Argos,<br> because of the red soil.<br> On either side of me stand<br> two assistant priests,<br> wearing masks as well...<br> Lumpy, pop-eyed masks,<br> such as were also found at Mycenae.<br> They're enormously strong, these<br> priests, and absolutely tireless.<br> As each child steps forward,<br> they grab it from behind<br> and throw it over the stone.<br> Then, with a surgical skill<br> that amazes even me,<br> I fit in the knife,<br> and slice elegantly<br> down to the navel,<br> just like a seamstress<br> following a pattern.<br> I part the flaps, sever<br> the inner tubes,<br> yank them out and throw them,<br> hot and steaming, on the floor.<br> The other two then study<br> the patterns they make,<br> as if they're reading<br> hieroglyphics.<br> It's obvious to me that<br> I'm tops, as chief priest.<br> It's this unique talent for carving<br> that's got me where I am.<br> The only thing is,<br> unknown to the others,<br> I'm beginning to feel<br> distinctly nauseous.<br> And with each victim,<br> it's getting worse.<br> My face is going green<br> behind the mask.<br> Of course, I redouble my<br> efforts to look professional,<br> cutting and snipping<br> for all I'm worth,<br> mainly because I know that if those two<br> others so much as suspect my distress,<br> and the implied doubt that<br> this repetitive and smelly work<br> is doing any social good at all,<br> then I'd be next over the stone.<br> And then, of course, the<br> damn mask begins to slip.<br> The priests both<br> turn and look at it.<br> Their gold pop-eyes<br> suddenly fill with blood.<br> They tear the knife<br> from my hand, and I...<br> I wake up.<br> Mrs. Strang, have you any idea<br> how this could have occurred?<br> No, Doctor.<br> It's all so unbelievable.<br> Alan was always such<br> a gentle boy. Always.<br> And he loves animals,<br> especially horses.<br> Thank you.<br> - Especially?<br> - Yes.<br> He even has a picture of one,<br> up in his bedroom.<br> His father gave it to him a few years<br> ago, off a calendar he'd had printed,<br> and the boy's never taken it down.<br> And, uh, when he was,<br> uh, seven or eight,<br> I used to have to read the same<br> book to him, over and over again,<br> all about a horse.<br> Really?<br> It was called prince,<br> and no one could ride him.<br> You say he kept the picture<br> of the horse in his bedroom?<br> Yes.<br> Could I see it?<br> Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, of course.<br> - Uh...<br> - Thank you.<br> It's, uh... Uh, please,<br> it's this way.<br> Uh, I do remember telling<br> him one very odd thing.<br> Did you know, Doctor, that<br> when the Christian cavalry<br> first appeared in the new world,<br> the pagans thought that horse<br> and rider was one person?<br> - One person?<br> - Yes.<br> Of course.<br> Actually, they thought<br> it must be a God.<br> In here, please.<br> This is Alan's room.<br> Remarkable.<br> Yes.<br> Mrs. Strang, is there...<br> Anything else you can remember<br> you told him about horses?<br> Anything at all?<br> Oh, well, they're in<br> the Bible of course.<br> "He saith among the<br> trumpets, ha-ha!"<br> "Ha-ha"?<br> The Book of Job.<br> Such a noble passage.<br> Do you know it?<br> "Hast thou given the<br> horse strength?<br> "Hast thou clothed his<br> neck with thunder?<br> "The glory of his<br> nostrils is terrible.<br> "He saith among the<br> trumpets, Ha-Ha!"<br> That's marvelous.<br> Yes.<br> Yes... Oh, there's Mr. Strang now.<br> Uh, Frank,<br> I've got the doctor here.<br> We'll come down.<br> Uh...<br> He's very upset.<br> You understand, of course?<br> Uh, this is Dr. Dysart, dear.<br> Mr. Strang. How do you do?<br> I was just telling<br> Dr. Dysart, dear,<br> how... how Alan<br> always adored horses.<br> Oh, yes?<br> Yeah, in fact, we've always<br> been a very horsey family.<br> Uh, well, uh, my side of it has.<br> Uh, my uncle used to ride every<br> morning on the downs behind Brighton,<br> all dressed up in a bowler hat and<br> jodhpurs. He used to look splendid.<br> Uh, "indulging in<br> equitation," he called it.<br> Uh, I remember telling Alan how<br> that word came from "equus."<br> "Equus"?<br> The Latin word for "horse."<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Alan was absolutely fascinated<br> by that word, I know.<br> I suppose because he'd never come across<br> one with two "u"s together before.<br> My dear, have you offered<br> the doctor a cup of tea?<br> Oh, no, no, dear, I haven't. Oh.<br> You must be dying for one.<br> Excuse me.<br> Oh, yes.<br> My, uh.<br> My wife has, uh,<br> romantic ideas,<br> if you receive my meaning.<br> About her family?<br> Yes. She thinks she<br> married beneath her.<br> I dare say, she did. I don't<br> understand these things myself.<br> Would you say that she's closer<br> to the boy than you are?<br> Oh, they've always been<br> as thick as thieves.<br> I can't say I entirely approve...<br> Especially when I hear her<br> reading that Bible to him,<br> night after night,<br> up there in his room.<br> You mean, she's, uh, religious?<br> Some might say excessively so.<br> Mind you, that is her<br> business, but, uh...<br> When it comes to dosing<br> it down the boy's throat,<br> well, frankly, he's my<br> son as well as hers.<br> Bloody religion.<br> Well, it's our only real problem<br> in this house,<br> but I... it's insuperable.<br> I don't mind admitting it.<br> You must excuse my husband, Doctor.<br> This one subject is something<br> of an obsession with him.<br> Isn't it, dear? You must admit.<br> Call it what you like. All that<br> stuff, to me, is just bad sex.<br> What has that<br> got to do with Alan?<br> Everything. Everything, Dora.<br> I don't understand.<br> What are you saying?<br> Mr. Strang, exactly how informed<br> would you judge your<br> son to be, about sex?<br> I don't know.<br> You didn't actually<br> instruct him yourself?<br> Well, not in so many words, no.<br> Uh, did you, Mrs. Strang?<br> Well, I spoke a little.<br> Yes, I had to.<br> Oh, let me help you.<br> Uh, what sort of things<br> did you tell him?<br> I'm sorry if this is embarrassing.<br> Uh, I told him the<br> biological facts.<br> But I also told him<br> what I believed,<br> that sex is not just a biological<br> matter, but a spiritual one as well,<br> that if God willed, he would<br> fall in love one day.<br> Uh. sugar?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Uh, that his task was<br> to prepare himself<br> for the most important<br> happening of his life.<br> And after that, if he was lucky, he would<br> come to know a higher love, still.<br> There, now. There, now, Dora.<br> Dora, it's all right. Come on.<br> Oh, God. Laugh. Laugh, as usual.<br> No one is laughing, Dora.<br> Dora.<br> Equus.<br> Eh...<br> Equus!<br> Equus!<br> Equus!<br> Equus! Equus!<br> Eq... Equus! Equus!<br> Equus!<br> Suddenly, I realized whose<br> face I'd seen in my dream.<br> On every victim across the stone,<br> it was his stare accusing me.<br> But what of?<br> Well...<br> How are you this morning?<br> Sorry if I gave you a<br> start last night, I...<br> I was collecting some papers from my<br> office, and I thought I'd look in on you.<br> Do you dream often?<br> Do you dream often?<br> Do you?<br> It's my job to ask the<br> questions, yours to answer them.<br> - Says who?<br> - Says me.<br> Do you dream often?<br> Do you?<br> Now, look, Alan...<br> I'll answer if you answer.<br> In turns.<br> Very well.<br> Only, we have to speak the truth.<br> Very well.<br> So.<br> Do you dream often?<br> Yes.<br> - Do you?<br> - Yes.<br> Do you have a special dream?<br> No.<br> Do you?<br> Yes. What was your dream about last night?<br> Can't remember. What's yours about?<br> I said, the truth.<br> That is the truth. What's yours about?<br> The special one.<br> Carving up children.<br> It's my turn.<br> What is your first<br> memory of a horse?<br> I can't remember.<br> You have no recollection of the first<br> time you ever noticed a horse?<br> I just told you. It's my turn.<br> All right.<br> Are you married?<br> I am.<br> Is she a doctor, too?<br> My turn.<br> What, uh...<br> What is, uh, "Eq"?<br> You shouted it out in<br> your sleep last night.<br> I thought perhaps you might<br> like to talk about it.<br> Plop, plop, fizz, fizz<br> Oh, what a relief it is<br> Plop, plop<br> Come on now, Alan,<br> you can do better than that.<br> So, Double Your pleasure<br> double your fun<br> You Can Double Everything<br> Rolled into one, one<br> All right, good morning.<br> What do you mean?<br> We're finished for today.<br> Only had five minutes.<br> Too bad.<br> Didn't you hear me?<br> I said, "Good morning."<br> Well, that's not fair.<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> The government pays<br> you L50 an hour to see me.<br> I know, I heard, downstairs.<br> So, go back downstairs<br> and hear some more.<br> That's not fair.<br> You're a swizz.<br> Bloody swizz! Swizz!<br> Do I have to call a nurse?<br> She puts a finger on<br> me, and I'll bash her.<br> She'll bash you a damn sight<br> harder, I can assure you of that.<br> Now, go.<br> On a beach.<br> What?<br> Where I first saw a horse.<br> Sod.<br> How old were you?<br> How should I know? Six.<br> - What were you doing there?<br> - Nothing.<br> Digging.<br> Sandcastles?<br> Well, what else?<br> Go on.<br> That's a terrific castle.<br> It must've taken a<br> long time to build.<br> You can stroke him if you like.<br> He won't mind.<br> His name's Trojan.<br> Easy there, Troj.<br> Easy, boy.<br> Easy there, Trojan.<br> Oh, you can hardly reach from<br> down there. You want to come up?<br> Come on, then.<br> No, come round this side.<br> You always mount a<br> horse from the left.<br> I'll give you a lift up, okay?<br> Now, do nothing at all.<br> Easy. boy! Easy!<br> Don't be frightened, now.<br> Hold on tight to his mane<br> and grip with your knees.<br> That's it. Come on, now. Let's go.<br> Do you want to go faster?<br> All you have to do is say, "Come<br> on, Trojan, bear me away."<br> Say it, then!<br> Bear me away.<br> I can't hear you. Say it!<br> Bear me away!<br> Come on, Trojan!<br> Alan!<br> Alan! Alan!<br> - Alan!<br> - Alan!<br> Alan!<br> Alan!<br> What... Come back here!<br> Alan!<br> Alan! Alan. Hey, you!<br> Easy, boy, easy.<br> What do you imagine you're doing?<br> - Imagine?<br> - What is my son doing up there?<br> It's all right, Frank.<br> He's not hurt, is he?<br> Don't you think to ask permission<br> before doing a thing<br> stupid like that?<br> It's lovely, Dad.<br> The boy is perfectly safe.<br> Please don't be hysterical!<br> Don't you be la-de-da<br> with me, young man.<br> Come down, here, Alan, you<br> heard what your mother said.<br> No.<br> - Come down here at once.<br> - No.<br> - Right this moment! I said, this moment!<br> - No.<br> Frank.<br> Ugh!<br> Watch it! Are you mad?<br> Alan!<br> Do you want to terrify the horse?<br> You're a public menace,<br> you know that?<br> Easy, Trojan.<br> How dare you pick up children<br> and put them on dangerous animals!<br> - Dangerous?<br> - Frank, the boy's hurt.<br> Look at his eyes, they're rolling.<br> So are yours.<br> Frank, he's cut himself.<br> The boy's hurt.<br> I'm not, I'm not! I'm not!<br> I'm not, I'm not! I'm not!<br> I'm not, I'm not! I'm not!<br> That's all I remember.<br> And a lot, too.<br> Thank you.<br> Do you know...<br> Do you know, I've... I've never<br> been on a horse in my life?<br> Nor me.<br> You mean, since that?<br> Yeah.<br> Never?<br> No.<br> How come?<br> I didn't care to.<br> You mean to say, you never rode,<br> even when you were at the stables?<br> No.<br> Wasn't that part of the job?<br> No, didn't have to.<br> Why not? Surely it would've been fun, after<br> being cooped up in that shop all week.<br> Just didn't care to, that's all.<br> Anyway, it's my turn. I told<br> you a secret, you tell me one.<br> All right.<br> There are patients who have things to<br> tell me, but they're ashamed to...<br> Say them to my face. What do<br> you think I do about that?<br> What?<br> I give them this<br> little tape recorder.<br> They go off to another room, and they<br> send the tape back through nurse.<br> They don't have to<br> listen to it with me.<br> Stupid.<br> Quite simple, really. You press<br> this button and speak into this.<br> Anyway, our time's up for today.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Maybe.<br> Maybe?<br> If I feel like it.<br> Stupid.<br> I thought I'd go in tomorrow,<br> and see the boy.<br> Would you come?<br> Frank, it's not right, your not...<br> But you should.<br> You've got to tell him.<br> The doctor, I mean.<br> He should know about that.<br> You think it's important?<br> Yes, I do.<br> Why?<br> Well, it just could be.<br> It was sexy. That's what you<br> want to know, isn't it?<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Doctor.<br> I hope it's not too late.<br> Uh, no, Mrs. Strang.<br> Uh, no, it's just that, uh,<br> Mr. Strang and I were talking,<br> and we felt there was something<br> you might want to know.<br> Could I come and see you tomorrow?<br> Why don't I come to see you?<br> I'm talking about the beach,<br> that time that I told you about.<br> I was pushed forward on the horse.<br> There was sweat on my<br> legs from his neck.<br> His sides were all warm...<br> The smell...<br> And turning him...<br> All that power, going<br> anywhere you wanted.<br> And then, Dad...<br> It's about the picture...<br> Of the horse.<br> Uh, the one on his bedroom wall?<br> I'm afraid I... I didn't quite<br> tell you all about it... last time.<br> I didn't think it<br> was that important.<br> You see...<br> It actually took the place of<br> another kind of picture altogether.<br> What kind?<br> It was a reproduction of our<br> Lord on his way to Calvary.<br> Uh, Alan insisted on buying<br> it with his own pocket money,<br> and hanging it where he could<br> see it, last thing at night.<br> My husband was very displeased.<br> And, to be fair,<br> it is a little extreme.<br> Then, one day,<br> Mr. Strang and I had one<br> of our tiffs about religion,<br> and he went straight up the stairs,<br> and tore it off the boy's wall.<br> Alan went quite hysterical.<br> He cried for days,<br> without stopping.<br> But he recovered when he was<br> given the picture of the horse?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Uh, he hung it in<br> exactly the same place.<br> And we had no more of<br> that awful weeping.<br> Mr. Dalton?<br> My name is Dysart. I'm a doctor.<br> I'm dealing with Alan Strang.<br> I mean, I'm treating Alan Strang.<br> I know this is an intrusion, but I,<br> I'd like to have a talk with you.<br> I realize this must<br> be difficult for you.<br> Difficult?<br> For lack of a word.<br> If I had my way,<br> that boy would be dead.<br> I should have killed<br> him that night.<br> Of course, now you've<br> got him in hospital.<br> Private room, three meals a day,<br> remedial therapy,<br> ping-pong, basketwork.<br> Hmph.<br> - Mr. Dalton...<br> - No, no, no. Quite right.<br> We've got to be, uh,<br> modern about it.<br> After all, there are<br> no criminals now.<br> We're all capable of everything.<br> I know. I've heard all about it.<br> Forgive and forget...<br> Two months ping-pong...<br> He's paid his debt to society, eh?<br> Mr. Dalton?<br> Damn you!<br> I'm sorry, I can't help it.<br> I keep seeing it.<br> Over and over, I see it.<br> Jill's had a breakdown.<br> - Jill?<br> - The girl who worked for me.<br> Complete and utter breakdown.<br> She'll never get over it.<br> Of course, she blames herself,<br> being the one who brought<br> him here to begin with.<br> He was introduced to<br> the stables by a girl?<br> I just told you, didn't I?<br> Jill, Jill Mason.<br> Excuse me for being stupid,<br> but was that his girlfriend?<br> How should I know?<br> No, he met up with her<br> somewhere, asked for a job.<br> She told him to come and see me.<br> Piss off now, will you?<br> Yes, I'll be going.<br> One thing, when he first appeared,<br> did he seem at all peculiar?<br> I mean, odd in any way?<br> No.<br> He did bloody good.<br> He spent hours with the horses,<br> cleaning and grooming,<br> way over the call of duty.<br> I thought he was a real find.<br> Apparently, the whole time he worked<br> for you, he never actually rode.<br> That's true.<br> Wasn't that peculiar?<br> Certainly, if he didn't.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean that, on and off, that<br> whole year, I had the feeling<br> the horses were<br> being taken out at night.<br> At night?<br> Oh, just odd things I noticed.<br> I mean...<br> Too often, one or other of them would<br> be sweaty first thing in the morning,<br> when it wasn't sick.<br> Very sweaty, too.<br> And its stall wouldn't be nearly<br> as mucky as it should be,<br> if it had been in all night.<br> Stupidly enough, I never paid<br> much mind to it at the time.<br> It wasn't until I realized<br> I'd been hiring a loony<br> that I came to wonder if he hadn't been<br> riding all the time, behind our backs.<br> All right, it's obviously<br> just my fancy.<br> This thing has shaken me so badly,<br> I'm liable to believe anything.<br> Why should anybody do that?<br> Why should any boy prefer to<br> go riding by himself at night,<br> when he could go off with<br> others during the day?<br> Are you asking me?<br> He's a loony, isn't he?<br> This girl, Jill Mason, could<br> you tell me where she lives?<br> Her mother keeps a shop,<br> a mile down the road.<br> Sells the antiques.<br> Thank you.<br> You won't see her.<br> And something else.<br> When the horse first appeared,<br> I looked up into his mouth.<br> There was this chain in it.<br> I said, "Does it hurt?" And he...<br> The horse said...<br> It was always the same, after that.<br> Every time I heard one clop<br> by, I had to run and see.<br> Up a country lane...<br> Anywhere...<br> Just to watch their skins...<br> And the way their necks twist.<br> The sweat comes in the folds.<br> Words like "reins,"<br> "stirrups," "flanks..."<br> "Dashing his spurs against<br> his charger's flanks..."<br> Even those words made me...<br> The way they give themselves to us.<br> That was it, too.<br> They could stamp us into bits anytime<br> they wanted, and they don't.<br> They just let themselves be turned on<br> a string all day, absolutely humble.<br> They give us all their strength, and<br> we just give them stripes for it.<br> They'll run forever.<br> They'll gallop till<br> they die, they will...<br> if we don't say "stop."<br> They live for us...<br> Just for us...<br> Their whole lives.<br> Years, I've never told anyone.<br> My mum wouldn't understand.<br> She likes equitation,<br> bowler hats, jodhpurs.<br> My uncle dressed for<br> the horses, she says.<br> But what does that mean?<br> Horse isn't dressed.<br> It's naked.<br> It's the most naked thing you ever saw,<br> more than a dog, a cat, or anything.<br> Even the brokenest-down<br> old nag has got its life.<br> Put a bowler hat<br> on top of it... filthy.<br> Putting them through their<br> paces, bloody horse shows.<br> How do they dare?<br> No one understands. No one.<br> Except cowboys. They do.<br> But they're free. They just swing up,<br> and it's nothing but miles of grass.<br> I bet all cowboys are orphans.<br> I bet they are.<br> No one ever says to cowboys,<br> "Receive my meaning" or God.<br> "All the time, God sees you, Alan.<br> God's got eyes everywhere."<br> No, I'm not doing<br> anymore, I hate this.<br> You can whistle for<br> anymore. I've had it.<br> I'm very busy, you know.<br> That's why I came to see you.<br> Mr. Strang, is there something<br> you're not telling me?<br> What do you mean?<br> The last time we met, you said that<br> religion was at the bottom of all this.<br> So it is.<br> Well, just because his<br> mother reads him the Bible?<br> Night after night.<br> Fifty years ago.<br> That would've been considered<br> proper conduct for a mother.<br> Mr. Strang, I know<br> I'm being impertinent.<br> I'm prying, and I'm nosy.<br> But if you want to help Alan,<br> you've got to help me.<br> Anything will do, Mr. Strang.<br> Any bloody thing!<br> Your wife told me<br> about the picture.<br> No, it's not that, it's...<br> It's about that.<br> But it's worse.<br> I wanted to tell you the other day,<br> but I couldn't in front of Dora.<br> Maybe I should have.<br> It might show her all that stuff leads to,<br> she drills into the boy, behind my back.<br> What kind of thing is it?<br> It's something I witnessed.<br> Where?<br> At home, 18 months ago.<br> Go on.<br> It was, uh, it was late.<br> The boy had been in bed hours,<br> or so I thought.<br> Go on.<br> As I came out of the bathroom,<br> I heard...<br> I heard the noise of this chanting.<br> Chanting?<br> Yes, you know.<br> By the Bible, you know, one of those lists<br> his mother was always reading to him.<br> Those "begat, so and so, begat..."<br> you know, genealogy. But, uh...<br> What did Alan's list sound like?<br> Well, I remember the<br> sort of thing I...<br> The first word I heard was...<br> Prince.<br> - Prince?<br> - Yeah.<br> Prince begat Prance.<br> And Prance begat Prankus.<br> And Prankus begat Flankus.<br> And Flankus begat Spankus.<br> And Spankus begat Spunkus the<br> great, who lived threescore years.<br> And Legwus begat Neckwus.<br> And Neckwus begat Fleckwus,<br> the king of spit.<br> And Fleckwus spoke out of his<br> chinkle-chankle.<br> What?<br> I'm sure that was the word.<br> I've never forgotten it.<br> "Chinkle-chankle."<br> And he said "Behold, I give you<br> Equus, my only begotten son."<br> Equus?<br> There's no doubt of that,<br> he repeated that word several times.<br> "Equus...<br> "My only begotten son."<br> And then...<br> He took this...<br> String.<br> And he put it in his mouth, and...<br> With his other hand...<br> He picked up this...<br> Coat hanger,<br> this wooden coat hanger...<br> Equus.<br> And he...<br> Equus.<br> Equus.<br> Well, you see why I...<br> I couldn't tell his mother.<br> Religion. Religion is the<br> bottom of this, don't you see?<br> Did you speak to him<br> about it later?<br> No.<br> I can't speak about<br> things like that, Doctor.<br> It's not in my nature.<br> No.<br> I see that.<br> Here, let me help you.<br> Just run it under the tap.<br> I must tell you that it's<br> been an enormous help...<br> Mr. Strang, is there...<br> Something else?<br> There is, actually. There's one...<br> There's one thing.<br> That night that he...<br> That he did it, that, uh,<br> that awful thing in the...<br> in the stables...<br> That night, he was out with a girl.<br> How do you know that?<br> Well, I just know, that's all.<br> Was that girl Jill Mason?<br> I don't know her name.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Strang,<br> what do you know?<br> - I can't say anymore.<br> - Mr. Strang...<br> Ask him! Just ask him about taking<br> a girl out that very night. It's...<br> Thanks for the tape.<br> It was excellent.<br> Yeah, I'm not making anymore.<br> One thing I didn't quite understand,<br> you began to say something<br> about the horse on the<br> beach talking to you.<br> Tsk. Stupid, horses don't talk.<br> So I believe.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> Never mind about that.<br> Tell me something else.<br> Who introduced you to the stable<br> to begin with?<br> Someone I met.<br> Where?<br> Hello, can I do something for you?<br> No.<br> You're always staring<br> in here, aren't you?<br> Me?<br> Yes. Every day, at lunchtime.<br> I've seen you.<br> Not me.<br> Course it's you. You looking<br> for a job, or something?<br> Is there one? I can<br> only do weekends.<br> That's when most people ride.<br> We could use extra hands.<br> It will mainly be mucking out.<br> Oh, I don't mind.<br> Please.<br> Come up on Saturday.<br> I'll introduce you to Mr. Dalton.<br> And you went?<br> Yeah.<br> Hello!<br> You came, then.<br> Let's find Mr. Dalton. My name's<br> Jill, by the way. What's yours?<br> All riders are accompanied, madam.<br> No riders are allowed<br> out on their own.<br> All right, I'll put her down for 3:00.<br> What is the name, please?<br> Mrs. Shawcross.<br> Thank you. Goodbye.<br> This is Alan Strang, Mr. Dalton.<br> Oh?<br> You ever worked in a stable before?<br> - Can you ride?<br> - No, I don't want to.<br> It's not extra, you know.<br> It comes with the job.<br> No, I just want to work here.<br> You like horses?<br> Well, we can certainly<br> use the help.<br> There's enough work around here<br> for six lads.<br> Four quid a day. Saturdays<br> and Sundays. All right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good.<br> Now, I expect the place neat,<br> dry and clean at all times.<br> The main rule is, never pretend you<br> know something when you don't.<br> Actually, the main rule<br> is, enjoy yourself.<br> Remember, 7:30 on the dot.<br> Horses don't oversleep,<br> you know. See you later.<br> This is Nugget. Come on,<br> that's it. Yeah.<br> Come on, come on.<br> He's my favorite.<br> This is a body brush.<br> You use it with a currycomb.<br> Now, you always groom the same<br> way, from the ears, downwards.<br> Don't be afraid to do it hard.<br> The harder you do it, the<br> more the horse loves it.<br> Push it right through<br> the coat, like this.<br> Work towards the tail,<br> and right through the coat.<br> See how he loves it?<br> Giving you a lovely<br> massage, aren't I, boy?<br> Here, you try.<br> Nice and easy.<br> Never rush.<br> Work towards the tail,<br> and right through the coat.<br> That's it.<br> Again.<br> You've got a feel<br> for it, I can tell.<br> It's going to be fun teaching you.<br> Jill! Jill!<br> What?<br> Mr. Dalton wants you,<br> please. Right away.<br> Keep that up for 15 minutes.<br> Then do old trooper.<br> See you later.<br> All right, I'm off now.<br> I'll be back after lunch.<br> If anyone rings, just<br> put it in the book.<br> Two rides this afternoon.<br> That's the lot.<br> Was it good? Touching them?<br> Must've been marvelous,<br> being near them at last,<br> making them fresh and glossy.<br> Tell me,<br> you worked at the<br> stable every weekend?<br> Yeah.<br> You must have<br> seen a lot of the girl.<br> Tell me about her.<br> Did you like her?<br> - Come on, Alan, tell me.<br> - All right.<br> Was she friendly?<br> Yes.<br> Or standoffish?<br> Yes.<br> Well, which?<br> What?<br> Which was she?<br> Tell me, did you, uh... Did<br> you ever take her out?<br> - Did you have dates with her?<br> - What?<br> Tell me if you did.<br> "Tell me!"<br> "Tell me, tell me, tell me" on and on.<br> Standing there, nosy parker.<br> That's all you are, a bloody<br> nosy parker, just like my dad.<br> "Answer this, answer that,"<br> never stop.<br> - Well, I'm sorry.<br> - All right.<br> Well, now it's my turn.<br> You tell me, answer me.<br> We're not playing that game now.<br> We're playing what I say.<br> All right.<br> What do you want to know?<br> Do you have dates?<br> I told you, I'm married.<br> I know. Her name's Margaret,<br> she's a dentist.<br> You see? I found out.<br> What made you go with her, then?<br> Did you used to bite her hands<br> when she did you in the chair?<br> That's not very funny.<br> Do you have girls behind her back?<br> No.<br> Then what? Do you fuck her?<br> All right.<br> Come on, tell me, tell me, tell me.<br> - That's enough now.<br> - I'll bet you don't.<br> I bet you never touch her.<br> You've got no kids, have you?<br> Is that because you don't fuck?<br> Go to your room.<br> Quick march.<br> Alan.<br> Give me those cigarettes.<br> Give them to me!<br> Now go.<br> Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.<br> The boy's on the run, so he turns<br> defensive. What am I, then?<br> Wicked little bastard. He knew<br> exactly what questions to try.<br> Not that there's anything<br> novel about that.<br> Advanced neurotics can<br> be dazzling at that game.<br> They aim unswervingly at your<br> area of maximum vulnerability,<br> which is, I suppose, as good a way<br> as any of describing Margaret.<br> Now, stop it.<br> Do I embarrass you?<br> I suspect you're about to.<br> My wife doesn't understand me,<br> your honor.<br> Do you understand her?<br> No.<br> Obviously, I never did.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I never like to ask.<br> But I always imagined you<br> weren't exactly compatible.<br> We were. It actually<br> worked for a bit.<br> I mean, for both of us.<br> She, for me, through a kind of...<br> Briskness,<br> a clear, redheaded,<br> inaccessible briskness,<br> that kept me keyed up for months.<br> Mind you, if you're kinky for<br> northern hygiene, which I am,<br> you can hardly find anything more<br> compelling than a Scottish lady dentist.<br> It's you who are wicked, you know.<br> Not at all.<br> She got exactly the same from me.<br> Antiseptic proficiency.<br> I was like that in those days.<br> I see us in our wedding<br> photograph, Dr. And Dr. Macbrisk.<br> We were brisk in our wooing, brisk in our<br> wedding, brisk in our disappointment.<br> We turned from each other briskly<br> into our separate surgeries,<br> and now, there's a<br> nice, brisk nothing.<br> You never had children, did you?<br> No.<br> We did not go in for them.<br> Instead she sits and knits things for<br> orphans in some home she works with,<br> and I sit opposite turning over the<br> pages of books on mythical Greece.<br> Mentally, we're in different parts<br> of the world.<br> She's forever in some drizzly<br> chapel of her own inheriting,<br> and I'm in some doric temple,<br> clouds tearing through the pillars,<br> eagles bearing prophesies<br> out of the sky.<br> She finds all that repulsive.<br> All that my wife has ever taken<br> from the Mediterranean,<br> from that whole,<br> vast, intuitive culture,<br> are four bottles of Chianti<br> to make into lamps,<br> and two China condiment donkeys<br> labeled Sally and Pepe.<br> Now you're being cruel.<br> I wish...<br> There was somebody in<br> this life I could show.<br> One...<br> Instinctive, absolutely unbrisk<br> person that I could take to Greece,<br> and stand in front of certain<br> shrines and sacred streams and say,<br> "Look, life is only<br> comprehensible through 1,000<br> "local Gods.<br> "Not just the old, dead Gods,<br> with names like Zeus,<br> "but living geniuses<br> of place and person.<br> "Not just Greece,<br> but modern England.<br> "Here, spirits of certain trees,<br> "of certain curves of brick wall,<br> "of certain fish-and-chip<br> shops, if you like,<br> "and... and slate roofs, and<br> "frowns in people, slouches."<br> I'd say to them,<br> "Worship...<br> "All you can see...<br> "And more will appear."<br> This boy.<br> With his stare,<br> he's trying to save<br> himself through me.<br> I'd say so.<br> What am I trying to do to him?<br> - Restore him.<br> - To what?<br> A normal life.<br> Normal?<br> It still means something, you know.<br> You mean, a normal<br> boy has one head.<br> A normal head has two ears.<br> - You know I don't...<br> - Then what do you mean?<br> Oh, stop it.<br> I want to know.<br> Look, my dear, you know what I mean<br> by a normal smile in a child's eyes,<br> and one that isn't, don't you?<br> Yes.<br> Then we have a duty to<br> that, surely, both of us.<br> Touche.<br> I'll talk to you.<br> Martin.<br> You're going through a rotten<br> patch at the moment, I'm sorry.<br> I suppose one of the<br> few things one can do<br> is simply hold on to priorities.<br> Such as?<br> Children before adults.<br> Things like that.<br> You're really quite<br> splendid, you know that?<br> Famous for it.<br> All right.<br> The normal is the good smile<br> in a child's eyes.<br> It's also the dead stare<br> in a million adults.<br> Both sustains and kills,<br> like a God.<br> It is the ordinary made beautiful.<br> It is also the average, made lethal.<br> The normal is the indispensable,<br> murderous God of health.<br> And I am his priest.<br> I'm sorry about our row yesterday.<br> Yeah, it was stupid.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, it was.<br> Would you like to play a game?<br> What kind?<br> It's one I invented myself.<br> It's called blink.<br> You fix your eyes on something, say, that<br> little stain on the wall over there,<br> and I tap my pencil on the desk.<br> First tap, you close your eyes.<br> The second, you open.<br> Close, open, close, open,<br> till I say "stop."<br> What's the point of that?<br> Well, relax you.<br> Make it easier for you to talk.<br> Stupid.<br> Well, you don't have to<br> if you don't want to.<br> I didn't say I didn't want to.<br> Well?<br> I don't mind.<br> All right.<br> Start watching that stain.<br> Now, put your hands by your<br> side, your fingers open wide.<br> The thing to do is to...

Steady, steady!<br> Steady, steady!<br> That's it, steady, steady.<br> Cowboys are watching,<br> taking off their Stetsons.<br> They know who we are.<br> They're admiring us.<br> Bowing low unto us.<br> Come on now, show them.<br> Canter!

On you!<br> I want to be inside you.<br> I want to be inside you, and be you.<br> Forever one person.<br> I love you!<br> Bear me away.<br> Make us now one person.<br> Ahh! One person!<br> Ahh! One person!<br> Amen.<br> Afterwards, he says,<br> they always embrace.<br> He showed me how he<br> stands in the night,<br> like a frozen tango dancer,<br> inhaling the cold...<br> Sweet breath.<br> Have you noticed it about horses,<br> the way they'll stand,<br> one hoof on its end,<br> like those girls in the ballet?<br> And now,<br> he's gone off to rest,<br> leaving me alone,<br> with Equus.<br> I can hear the creature's voice.<br> He's calling me out of the<br> black cave of the psyche.<br> I shove in my dim little torch,<br> and there he stands,<br> waiting for me.<br> He raises his matted head.<br> He opens his great square teeth,<br> and he says,<br> "Why? Why me?<br> "Why, ultimately, me?<br> "Do you really imagine<br> you can account for me,<br> "totally, infallibly,<br> inevitably account for me?<br> "Poor Dr. Dysart."<br> Of course, I've stared<br> at such images before,<br> or been stared at by them,<br> whichever way you look at it.<br> And weirdly, often now with me, the<br> feeling is that they are staring at us.<br> That in some quite palpable way,<br> they precede us.<br> Meaningless, but unsettling.<br> In either case,<br> this particular one.<br> This huge, implacable head<br> is the most alarming yet.<br> It asks questions I've avoided<br> all my professional life.<br> A child is born into a world of phenomena,<br> all equal in their power to enslave.<br> It sniffs, it sucks, it strokes its eyes,<br> over the whole, uncountable range.<br> Suddenly, one strikes.<br> Then another. Then another.<br> Why?<br> Moments snap together, like magnets<br> forging a chain of shackles.<br> Why?<br> I can trace them. I can even,<br> with time, pull them apart again.<br> But why, at the start,<br> they were ever magnetized at all,<br> why those particular moments<br> of experience and no others,<br> I do not know, and nor<br> does anybody else!<br> And if I don't know,<br> if I can never know,<br> what am I doing here?<br> I don't mean clinically doing, or<br> socially doing, but fundamentally.<br> These whys, these questions,<br> are fundamental.<br> Yet they have no place<br> in a consulting room.<br> So, then, do I?<br> Do any of us?<br> This is the feeling, more and more.<br> Displacement.<br> Relentless...<br> Displacement.<br> "Account for me,"<br> says staring Equus.<br> "First, account for me!"<br> Dr. Dysart!<br> Dr. Dysart!<br> There's a terrible scene with the<br> Strang boy in the violence room.<br> His mother brought him chocolates.<br> He threw them at her, hard!<br> Don't you dare!<br> Don't you dare.<br> Don't you look at me like that.<br> I'm not a doctor, you know,<br> who'll take anything.<br> Don't you give me that<br> stare, young man.<br> Mrs. Strang.<br> I know your stares, they<br> don't work on me...<br> Leave here at once!<br> - What did you say?<br> - I tell you to leave here at once.<br> Goodbye, Alan.<br> Wait for me here.<br> I must ask you never<br> to come here again.<br> You think I want to?<br> Do you think I want to?<br> Mrs. Strang, what on<br> earth has got into you?<br> Into me?<br> - Can't you see the boy's highly distressed?<br> - Oh, really?<br> Yes, he's at the most<br> delicate stage of treatment.<br> He's totally ex... ex... exposed,<br> ashamed, everything you can imagine.<br> And me?<br> What about me?<br> What do you think I am?<br> I'm a parent. Of course,<br> that doesn't count.<br> That's a dirty word in here,<br> isn't it? "Parent"?<br> Now, you know that's not true.<br> Oh, I know it, I know it, all right.<br> I've heard it all my life.<br> I... it's our fault.<br> Whatever happens, we did it.<br> You come to us and say,<br> "Who forbids television?<br> "Who does what behind whose back?"<br> As if we're criminals.<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> We're not criminals.<br> We've done nothing wrong.<br> We loved Alan. We gave him<br> the best love we could.<br> Poor Frank digs into the boy too much,<br> but... but nothing in excess.<br> He's not a bully.<br> No, Doctor.<br> Whatever has happened,<br> has happened because of Alan.<br> If you added up everything<br> we ever did to him,<br> from his first day<br> on Earth to this,<br> you wouldn't find out why<br> he did this, t... terrible thing.<br> Do you understand what I'm saying?<br> I want you to understand,<br> because I lie awake, and<br> awake, thinking it out.<br> And I want you to know that I deny<br> it absolutely, what he's doing now.<br> Staring at me, attacking<br> me for what he's done.<br> For what... he... is.<br> - Mrs. Strang!<br> - Oh!<br> You have your words,<br> and I have mine.<br> But if you knew God, Doctor,<br> you would know about the devil.<br> The devil isn't made by what<br> Mummy says, or what Daddy says.<br> The devil is there.<br> It's an old-fashioned<br> word, but a true thing.<br> I'll go.<br> What I did just now<br> was inexcusable.<br> I only know that...<br> He was my little Alan,<br> and then the devil came.<br> I thought you liked your mother.<br> She doesn't know<br> anything, you know.<br> I haven't told her what you told me.<br> You know that, don't you?<br> It was lies, anyway.<br> What was?<br> You and your pencil.<br> Just a con-trick, that's all.<br> Made me say a lot of lies.<br> Like what?<br> All of it. Everything I said.<br> A lot of lies.<br> I see.<br> Ought to be locked up.<br> Bloody tricks.<br> Thought you liked tricks.<br> It'll be the drug next, huh?<br> What drug?<br> I've heard. I'm not ignorant.<br> I know what you get up to in here,<br> shove needles in people and pump<br> them full of truth drugs, so they...<br> Can't help saying things.<br> That's next, isn't it?<br> Alan,<br> do you know why you're here?<br> So you can give me truth drugs.<br> - He actually believes they exist.<br> - Truth drugs?<br> Yes.<br> And don't they?<br> Of course not.<br> The important thing is that he...<br> Wants a way to speak, to finally tell<br> me what happened in those stables.<br> Tape is too isolated,<br> and hypnosis, he pretends, is a<br> trick, so he can deny it later.<br> Now I'm tempted to<br> play a real trick on him.<br> Like what?<br> Give him an aspirin.<br> Tell him it's the strongest<br> truth drug in the world.<br> He'd just deny everything<br> again afterwards.<br> The same thing all over.<br> No, because I'd tell him the truth<br> afterwards, that it was simply an aspirin.<br> And he'll believe me.<br> You know, underneath all that<br> glowering, the boy trusts me.<br> You realize that?<br> Oh, I'm sure he does.<br> Poor, bloody fool.<br> Oh, now, please, Martin, dear,<br> don't start that again.<br> Can you think of anything<br> worse one can do to somebody<br> than to take away their worship?<br> Worship?<br> Yes, that word again.<br> Isn't that a little extreme?<br> Extremity...<br> Is the point.<br> Worship isn't destructive,<br> Martin. I know that.<br> I don't.<br> I only know it's the<br> core of his life.<br> What else has he got? I mean, think<br> about it. He can hardly read.<br> He knows no physics or engineering<br> to make the world real to him,<br> no paintings to show him<br> how others have enjoyed it,<br> no music except television jingles,<br> no history except tales<br> from a desperate mother.<br> No friends, not one kid<br> to give him a joke,<br> or make him know<br> himself more moderately.<br> He's a modern citizen for<br> whom society doesn't exist.<br> He lives one hour every three<br> weeks, howling in a mist.<br> "With my body, I thee worship."<br> Many men are less vital<br> with their wives.<br> All the same, they don't usually<br> blind their wives, do they?<br> - Oh, come on.<br> - Well, do they?<br> You mean he's a madman?<br> A violent, dangerous madman,<br> who'll go round the country,<br> doing it again and again?<br> I mean he's in pain, Martin.<br> He's been in pain for<br> most of his life.<br> Yes.<br> And you can take it away.<br> Yes.<br> Then that's all you need<br> to know, in the end.<br> No.<br> Why not?<br> Because it is his.<br> His?<br> His pain.<br> His own.<br> He made it.<br> I don't understand.<br> Well, I don't!<br> I mean, there's nothing<br> meritorious about being in pain,<br> that's just pure old masochism.<br> I'm talking about passion, Hesther.<br> Do you know what that word<br> meant originally? Suffering.<br> The way you get your own spirit<br> through your own suffering.<br> Self-chosen. Self-made.<br> This boy's done that.<br> He's created his own desperate<br> ceremony just, just to...<br> Just to ignite one flame<br> of original ecstasy<br> in... in the spiritless<br> waste around him.<br> All right.<br> He's destroyed for it, horribly.<br> He's virtually been<br> destroyed by it.<br> But one thing I know for sure,<br> that boy has known a passion<br> more ferocious than I have known<br> in any second of my life.<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> I envy it.<br> - You can't.<br> - Don't you see?<br> That's what his stare has been<br> saying to me all this time.<br> "At least I galloped.<br> When did you?"<br> I'm jealous, Hesther.<br> Jealous...<br> Of Alan Strang.<br> That's absurd.<br> Is it?<br> Yes, utterly.<br> Utterly!<br> I go on about my wife.<br> Have you thought about the husband?<br> The finicky, critical husband, with<br> his art books on mythical Greece?<br> What worship has he ever known?<br> Real worship?<br> Without worship, you... you shrink!<br> It's as brutal as that. I shrank my<br> own life. No one can do it for you.<br> I settled for being pallid and provincial<br> out of my own eternal timidity.<br> The old... the old story of<br> bluster, and do bugger-all.<br> I didn't even dare<br> to have children...<br> Didn't dare to bring children into a<br> house and marriage as cold as mine.<br> I tell everyone Margaret's<br> the Puritan, I'm the pagan.<br> Some pagan. Such wild returns<br> I make to the womb of civilization.<br> Three weeks a year in<br> the Mediterranean.<br> Every bed booked in advance,<br> every meal paid for with vouchers,<br> cautious jaunts in hired cars,<br> suitcase crammed with kaopectate.<br> What a fantastic surrender<br> to the primitive.<br> And the "primitive."<br> I use that word endlessly.<br> "Ah, the primitive world," I say,<br> "What instinctual truths<br> were lost with it."<br> And while I sit there baiting that poor,<br> unimaginative woman with the word,<br> that freaky boy is trying<br> to conjure the reality.<br> I look at pages of centaurs<br> trampling the soil of Argos.<br> And outside my window, that boy is trying<br> to become one in a Hampshire field.<br> I sit there, night after night<br> watching that woman knitting,<br> a woman I haven't<br> kissed in six years.<br> And he stands for an<br> hour in the dark,<br> sucking the sweat off<br> his god's hairy cheek.<br> Then in the morning, I put away<br> my books on the cultural shelf,<br> close up my Kodachrome<br> snaps of Mount Olympus,<br> touch my reproduction statue<br> of Dionysus for luck,<br> and then go off to the<br> hospital to treat him...<br> For insanity.<br> Now do you see?<br> The boy's in pain, Martin.<br> That's all I see.<br> I understand, you know.<br> I'm not just being Mrs. Macbrisk.<br> You haven't made that kind of pain.<br> So few of us have.<br> But you've still made other things.<br> Your own thoughts. Your own skill.<br> Skill absolutely, what you said,<br> unique to you.<br> I've watched you do it, year<br> after year, and it's marvelous!<br> I mean, you can't<br> just sit there now,<br> and say it's all provincial,<br> you're just a butcher.<br> All that stuff is stupid, hateful.<br> All right, you never galloped.<br> Too bad.<br> Let me tell you, if I have to choose between<br> his galloping and your sheer training,<br> I'll take the training every time.<br> And what's more, so will<br> the boy, at this moment.<br> That stare of his isn't accusing<br> you, my dear, it's simply demanding.<br> - What?<br> - Just that.<br> Your power to pull him out of the<br> nightmare he's galloped himself into.<br> Do you see?<br> Do you see?<br> It is all true, what I said<br> after you tapped the pencil.<br> Postscriptum, I know<br> why I'm in here.<br> I got your note. Thank you.<br> Also for the postscriptum.<br> Well, that's the right word.<br> Me mum told me.<br> It's Latin. It means<br> "after writing."<br> Sorry I didn't see you today.<br> You're fed up with me?<br> Yes.<br> Can I make it up to you now?<br> What do you mean?<br> I thought we'd have a session.<br> Now?<br> Yes, at dead of night.<br> Better than going<br> to sleep, isn't it?<br> Listen, Alan.<br> Everything I say has<br> a trick or a catch.<br> Everything I do has<br> a trick or a catch.<br> It's the only thing I know<br> to do. But they...<br> They work. And you<br> know that, don't you?<br> Now trust me.<br> You got another trick, then?<br> Yes.<br> - Truth drug?<br> - If you like.<br> What's it do?<br> Make it easier for you to talk.<br> What, like you can't help yourself?<br> Yes, like you have to speak the<br> truth at all costs, and all of it.<br> Where is it?<br> Here.<br> Let's see.<br> Is that really it?<br> Yes.<br> You want to try it?<br> No.<br> I think you do.<br> I don't, not at all.<br> Afterwards, you'd sleep.<br> You'd have no more bad<br> dreams all night.<br> Probably for many<br> nights from then on.<br> How long does it take to work?<br> - It's instant, like coffee.<br> - It isn't.<br> Promise.<br> Well?<br> Can I have a cigarette?<br> Pill first.<br> What'll I feel first?<br> Nothing much.<br> After a minute, about 100 green<br> snakes will come out of that cabinet,<br> singing the hallelujah chorus.<br> No, I'm serious.<br> You'll feel nothing.<br> Nothing is going to happen,<br> but what you want to happen.<br> You're not going to say anything<br> to me, but what you want to say.<br> Sit back. Relax.<br> Finish your cigarette.<br> Bet this room's heard<br> some funny things.<br> It certainly has.<br> I like it.<br> - This room?<br> - Don't you?<br> Well, there's...<br> Nothing much to like, is there?<br> Actually, I'd like to leave<br> this room, and never...<br> Never set foot in it<br> again in my life.<br> Why?<br> Been in it too long.<br> Where would you go?<br> Somewhere.<br> Secret?<br> Yes.<br> There's a sea...<br> A great sea that I love.<br> It's where the Gods used to bathe.<br> What Gods?<br> The old ones, before they died.<br> Gods don't die.<br> Oh, yes, they do.<br> Come with me.<br> It's a village I spent<br> a night in once,<br> where I'd like to live.<br> All white.<br> How would you nosy parker, though?<br> You wouldn't have a<br> room for it anymore.<br> Well, I wouldn't mind.<br> I don't actually enjoy being<br> a nosy parker, you know.<br> Then why do it?<br> Because you're unhappy.<br> So are you.<br> Here, I didn't mean that.<br> It's all right.<br> No... is that how it works?<br> Things just slip out without<br> you feeling anything?<br> Yes.<br> So quick.<br> I told you.<br> You can say anything under it?<br> Yes.<br> Well, ask me a question.<br> All right.<br> Tell me about Jill.<br> Nothing to tell.<br> Nothing?<br> Well, for example,<br> is she, uh, pretty?<br> You've never described her to me.<br> She's all right.<br> What color is her hair?<br> - Don't know.<br> - Is it long or short?<br> Don't know.<br> Now, come on, Alan, surely,<br> you must know that.<br> I don't remember. I don't!<br> Alan,<br> you're going to do<br> this, and do it now.<br> You're going to tell me everything<br> that happened with this girl.<br> And now, not just tell me, show me.<br> Act it out, if you like, even more<br> than when I tapped the pencil.<br> I want you to feel free to do<br> anything you like in this room.<br> The pill will help you,<br> I will help you.<br> Now describe her to me.<br> Is her hair long or short?<br> Down to here.<br> - You sure?<br> - Yes.<br> Well?<br> She was posh.<br> You mean snobbish?<br> Yeah, no. I don't know!<br> - She was always looking.<br> - At you?<br> Saying stupid things.<br> Always asking questions.<br> Like what?<br> Do you find them sexy?<br> What?<br> Horses.<br> Don't be daft.<br> Girls do.<br> I mean, they go through a period where<br> they pat them and kiss them a lot.<br> I know I did.<br> - I suppose it's just a substitute, really.<br> - That kind of thing, all the time.<br> Till one night...<br> Yes, what?<br> It was her idea. She got me<br> into it, the whole thing.<br> What are you saying?<br> One night? Go on from there.<br> It was a Saturday night.<br> We were just closing up.<br> How would you like to take me out?<br> What?<br> How would you like to<br> take me out tonight?<br> No, I've got to go home.<br> What for?<br> They expect me.<br> Ring up and say you're going out.<br> I can't.<br> Why not?<br> They expect me.<br> Look, either we go out<br> together and have some fun,<br> or you go back to your boring home,<br> as usual, and I go back to mine.<br> That's the situation, isn't it?<br> Where would we go?<br> There's a skin flick<br> over in Winchester.<br> I've never seen one. Have you?<br> Wouldn't you like to?<br> All those heavy Swedes<br> panting at one another.<br> Well?<br> What do you say?<br> Yeah.<br> Well?<br> So you did?<br> I'm tired now. I want to stop.<br> - Come on, now. You can't stop there.<br> - Well, I'm tired, I want to go to bed!<br> - Well, you can't.<br> - Why?<br> I want to hear about that film.<br> - Hear what? What? It was bloody awful.<br> - Why?<br> - Nosy parker!<br> - Why?<br> - Because...<br> - Yes?<br> The whole place was full of men.<br> Jill was the only girl.<br> It was daft.<br> All took place in Sweden.<br> There was this girl,<br> Brita, who was 16.<br> She went to stay in this house<br> where there was an older boy.<br> He kept giving her looks.<br> But she ignored him completely.<br> Instead, she took a shower.<br> She went into the bathroom<br> and took off all her clothes,<br> the lot, very, very slowly.<br> It was fantastic.<br> Water fell down her,<br> bouncing off her breasts.<br> Is that the first time you'd<br> ever seen a girl naked?<br> Yes.<br> Couldn't see everything, though.<br> It was funny.<br> All around me, all the<br> men were staring up,<br> like they were in a church.<br> Like a secret congregation.<br> Like those early Christians<br> my mum talks about,<br> the ones that came together<br> in caves underground.<br> And then...<br> - Christ!<br> - What?<br> Dad!<br> I think he saw me.<br> Alan!<br> You can hear me. Don't pretend.<br> - Do I have to come and fetch you? Alan!<br> - Shut up, will you?<br> - Alan!<br> - Stop it!<br> - Come here this instant. Come on!<br> - But, Dad!<br> Come on.<br> - You went with him, then?<br> - What else could I do?<br> It was weird.<br> I mean, it turned into<br> follow the leader.<br> Dad trying to look<br> impressive, and me,<br> I suppose, thinking<br> I ought to copy him.<br> It was absolutely stupid.<br> We stood at the bus stop, like<br> we were three people in a queue,<br> who didn't know each other.<br> We must have stayed like<br> that for five minutes.<br> I tried to speak, I said, I've never<br> been in there before in my life.<br> Never.<br> Honest.<br> Jill tried.<br> It's true, Mr. Strang.<br> It wasn't Alan's idea to go<br> there at all. It was mine.<br> I'm not shocked by films<br> like that, I just...<br> Think they're silly, that's all.<br> Bus wouldn't come.<br> We stood, we stood.<br> And then suddenly, he spoke.<br> It felt like it was somebody<br> else talking for him.<br> I would like you to know<br> something, both of you.<br> Hey!<br> I came here tonight<br> to see the manager.<br> He asked me to call on him<br> for business purposes.<br> I happen to be a printer, miss...<br> The picture house needs posters.<br> That is entirely why I'm<br> here, to discuss posters.<br> And while I was there, I happened<br> to glance in, and I saw...<br> I can only say that I am going<br> to complain to the council.<br> I had no idea they<br> showed films like this.<br> I'm certainly going to<br> refuse my services.<br> Yes, of course.<br> So long as that is understood.<br> Perfectly.<br> Come along, Alan.<br> No.<br> No fuss, please. Just... just say<br> good night to the young lady.<br> No, I'm stopping here.<br> I've got to see her home.<br> It's proper.<br> Hmph. Very well.<br> I'll see you when you<br> choose to return, then.<br> Very well. Yes.<br> Terrible.<br> What was?<br> His face.<br> He was scared.<br> Scared of me.<br> We've got to walk.<br> It's four miles.<br> Yes?<br> What were you thinking?<br> It was like I'd been fooled.<br> Like I was the only<br> person who didn't know.<br> Every man in the street, everyone<br> I've ever seen, they all do it.<br> All of them, they're not just dads.<br> They're all people with pricks.<br> And my dad, he's not just a dad either.<br> He's a man with a prick, too.<br> He's nothing special.<br> Nothing special at all. Just<br> a poor old sod on his own.<br> He goes off at night and<br> does his own secret thing,<br> which no one will know<br> about, just like me.<br> You were happy<br> at that second, weren't you,<br> when you thought about your dad?<br> Other people have secrets, too.<br> Not just you.<br> Yes.<br> And you felt free, didn't you?<br> Free to do almost anything.<br> Yes.<br> What's in your head?<br> Her eyes.<br> I keep looking at them,<br> because I really want...<br> I really wanted...<br> To look at her breasts?<br> Yes.<br> I love your eyes.<br> Her face was so warm.<br> You want her very much?<br> I can't!<br> - Go on.<br> - I can't!<br> Of course you can.<br> You're doing wonderfully.<br> Don't make me, please.<br> Don't think, just answer.<br> Come on, Alan.<br> Where are you now, Alan?<br> Cabbages, with the moon on them.<br> Like steel.<br> All the country, like<br> it's been steel-plated.<br> I know absolutely<br> where we're going.<br> Absolutely.<br> And I can't stop it.<br> What?<br> Nothing.<br> Come on, then.<br> Where do you go now?<br> Into his temple?<br> His holy of holies?<br> What else can I do?<br> Are you all right?<br> Why?<br> You look weird.<br> Come here.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Good things come in threes.<br> What's the matter?<br> Alan?<br> What is it? Say.<br> Yes, all right, leave.<br> Take your sweater off.<br> I will, if you will.<br> You're beautiful.<br> So are you.<br> She put her mouth in mine.<br> It was lovely.<br> It was lovely.<br> What did you do then?<br> I put it in her.<br> - Yes?<br> - I put it in her.<br> - You did?<br> - Yes.<br> - Was it easy?<br> - Yes.<br> Describe it.<br> I told you.<br> What, exactly?<br> - I put it in her.<br> - Did you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Did you?<br> - All the way.<br> - Did you, Alan?<br> All the way, I shoved it.<br> I put it in her all the way.<br> - Did you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Did you, Alan?<br> - Yes! Yes!<br> Tell me the truth, Alan. Did you?<br> Fuck off!<br> What was it?<br> You couldn't, though you...<br> wanted to very much?<br> I couldn't see her.<br> What do you mean?<br> Only him!<br> Every time I kissed her,<br> he was in the way.<br> - Who?<br> - You know who!<br> When I touched her, I felt him.<br> His side under me,<br> waiting for my hand.<br> I refused him. I looked...<br> Looked right at her,<br> and I couldn't do it.<br> When I shut my eyes, I saw him at<br> once, the streaks on his belly.<br> I couldn't feel her flesh at all.<br> I wanted the foam...<br> Off his neck,<br> not flesh, hide, horse hide.<br> And I couldn't even kiss her.<br> - Hello?<br> - No.<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> I don't mind.<br> Really, I don't.<br> Alan?<br> - Look at me.<br> - Get out.<br> - What?<br> - Out!<br> There's nothing wrong.<br> Believe me.<br> Please, believe me, there's<br> nothing at all wrong.<br> Get out!<br> Listen to me.<br> Why don't we just<br> sit down for a bit and talk?<br> Please.<br> - Just talk?<br> - Please.<br> Look, Alan,<br> there's nothing wrong, you know.<br> It happens sometimes.<br> It really doesn't matter.<br> Well, you tell anyone, just<br> you tell and see, that's all.<br> What do you think I am, Alan?<br> I'm your friend.<br> Do you want me to go, then?<br> Get out!<br> Equus.<br> Equus.<br> Friend.<br> Friend.<br> Equus the merciful.<br> Forgive me.<br> It wasn't me, not really me.<br> Take me back.<br> I'll never do it again,<br> I swear, please.<br> Please.<br> And he? What does he say?<br> "Mine. You're mine.<br> "I am yours, and you are mine.<br> "I see you. I see you, always,<br> everywhere, forever."<br> "Kiss anyone, and I will see.<br> "Lie with anyone, and I will see.<br> Ahh!<br> "And you will fail, Alan.<br> "Forever and ever you will fail.<br> "You will see me,<br> and you will fail.<br> "The Lord thy God<br> is a jealous God."<br> He sees you, Alan.<br> He sees you, forever<br> and ever, Alan.<br> He sees you. He sees you.<br> Eyes, white eyes all round. Eyes,<br> like flames coming, coming. God sees.<br> God sees. My God hast seen!<br> No.<br> No more, Equus.<br> Thou, God,<br> seest...<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing!<br> Here I am. Find me. Find me.<br> Kill me. Kill me.<br> Find me, and kill me.<br> Kill me!<br> Find me!<br> And kill me!<br> Here I am. Here I am.<br> Find me. Kill me.<br> Find me and kill me.<br> Find me and kill me.<br> Find me and kill me!<br> Kill me!<br> Kill me!<br> Kill me!<br> Argh!<br> Alan.<br> Alan. Alan.<br> Breathe. Breathe in.<br> Calm, Alan. Calm. Calm.<br> Calm.<br> Now breathe in, deep.<br> Deep.<br> Breathe in.<br> Out. In.<br> Out. In.<br> Out.<br> Come on. Come on,<br> that's a good boy.<br> Keep it going. In. Out.<br> In. Out.<br> Keep it going. Keep it going.<br> Keep it going.<br> Easy, now. Easy, now. There.<br> There.<br> It's all over now, Alan.<br> All over now.<br> He'll go away now.<br> You'll never see him again.<br> You'll never see him again,<br> I promise you.<br> There'll be no more bad dreams.<br> No more awful nights.<br> Think of that.<br> You're going to be well.<br> I'm going to make you well.<br> I promise you.<br> You just trust me.<br> Trust me.<br> Just trust me.<br> Trust me.<br> Now trust me, Alan.<br> You lie back.<br> Lie back.<br> Sleep.<br> Just sleep.<br> You've earned it.<br> Sleep, Alan.<br> Sleep.<br> Remember,<br> he'll go away now.<br> I'm going to make you well.<br> Sleep.<br> Sleep.<br> I'm lying to you, Alan.<br> He won't really go that easily,<br> just clop away,<br> like some nice old carthorse.<br> No, when Equus leaves, if he leaves<br> at all, it'll be with your...<br> intestines in his teeth.<br> And I don't<br> stock replacements.<br> The boy's in pain, Martin.<br> Yes.<br> But you can take it away.<br> Yes.<br> Then that has to be enough for you.<br> All right.<br> I'll take it away. What then?<br> He'll feel himself acceptable.<br> What then?<br> You think feelings like his<br> can be simply reattached,<br> like plasters stuck on<br> other objects we select?<br> I mean, look at him.<br> My desire might be to make of this boy<br> an ardent husband, a caring citizen,<br> a worshipper of<br> abstract and unifying God.<br> My achievement, however,<br> is more likely to make a ghost.<br> I'll heal the rash on his body.<br> I'll erase the welts cut into<br> his mind by flying manes.<br> And when that's done,<br> I'll put him on a metal scooter,<br> and send him puttering off<br> into the concrete world,<br> and he'll never touch hide again.<br> Hopefully, he'll feel nothing<br> at his fork but approved flesh,<br> I doubt, however,<br> with much passion.<br> Passion, you see,<br> can be destroyed by a doctor.<br> It cannot be created.<br> You won't gallop anymore, Alan.<br> Horses will be quite safe.<br> You'll save your money every week,<br> and change that scooter for a car,<br> and spend glorious<br> weekends grooming that.<br> You'll pop round to the betting shop<br> and put the odd 50 pence on the nags,<br> quite forgetting that they ever<br> meant anything more to you<br> than bearers of little<br> profits and little losses.<br> You will, however, be without pain,<br> almost completely without...<br> Pain.<br> And now,<br> for me,<br> it never stops,<br> the voice of Equus,<br> out of the cave.<br> "Why me?<br> "Why me?<br> "First...<br> "Account for me."<br> How can I?<br> In an ultimate sense,<br> I cannot know what<br> I do in this place.<br> Yet I do ultimate things,<br> irreversible things.<br> And I...<br> I stand in the dark with<br> a blade in my hand,<br> striking at heads.<br> I need...<br> More desperately than my children<br> need me, a way of seeing in the dark.<br> What way is this?<br> What dark is this?<br> I cannot call it ordained of God!<br> I cannot go so far!<br> I will, however, pay<br> it so much homage.<br> There is now, in my mouth,<br>
