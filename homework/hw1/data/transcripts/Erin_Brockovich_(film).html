I trusted you.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -I don't need pity.<br> I need a paycheck.<br> And l've looked.<br> When you spend 6 years raising babies,<br> it's hard to get a job that pays.<br> Are you getting this down, honey?<br> Or am I talking too fast for you?<br> I'm sorry about that.<br> But we have a full staff now--<br> Bullshit. If you had a full staff,<br> you'd return a client's damn call.<br> I'm smart and hard-working.<br> I'm not leaving here without a job.<br> Don't make me beg.<br> If it doesn't work out, fire me.<br> Don't make me beg.<br> No benefits.<br> What we do in here is file<br> all of the cases.<br> That way, at any time,<br> we can tell the status of a file.<br> Where it is in the office and stuff.<br> Here's where we organize<br> all the files alphabetically.<br> -Simple enough.<br> -Okay.<br> -And here is your desk.<br> -Okay.<br> I want to show you where<br> the Xerox machine is.<br> Everybody has a code.<br> -Do I get to pick my own code?<br> -We'll see.<br> Can you tell me who I talk to about<br> getting an advance on my paycheck?<br> Just for the weekend.<br> Rosalind's the office manager.<br> She handles the payroll<br> and petty cash.<br> She's gone already.<br> She leaves early on Fridays.<br> -Okay, thank you.<br> -Oh, for Pete's sake, here.<br> I've only got hundreds.<br> I don't want your money, Mr. Masry.<br> Where do you think<br> your paycheck comes from?<br> -Have a good weekend.<br> -Thank you.<br> -See you.<br> -All right, see you.<br> See you Monday.<br> Hi, my sweetie.

There.<br> We're introduced.<br> So shut up.<br> Wait. Hold on there.<br> Let's start over, okay?<br> My name's George.<br> What's yours?<br> Just think of me as the person<br> next door who likes it quiet.<br> Don't be like that.<br> Look, we live next door.<br> I feel bad.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Will you accept my apology?<br> We're living right next door.<br> If you need a cup of a sugar--<br> -I don't need sugar.<br> -You don't.<br> Why don't I take you<br> out to dinner to apologize?<br> Give me your number.<br> I got your address...<br> ...so you can't get away.<br> I'll call you up proper<br> and ask you out.<br> You want my number?<br> I do. I do want your number.<br> Which number do you want, George?<br> I like the way you say that.<br> How many numbers you got?<br> I got numbers coming out<br> of my ears. For instance, 1 0.<br> -Ten.<br> -Yeah.<br> That's how many months old<br> my baby girl is.<br> -You got a little girl?<br> -Yeah.<br> Sexy, huh? How about this? Six.<br> That's my other daughter.<br> Eight is my son.<br> Two is the times<br> l've been married and divorced.<br> $1 6 is what I have<br> in my bank account.<br> I'm guessing zero is the number<br> of times you're gonna call it.<br> Hey, how do you remember<br> your bank balance?<br> See, that impresses me.<br> You're dead wrong about that zero.<br> How long has she been crying?<br> She's got that tooth coming in.<br> Give her a cold washcloth to suck on.<br> I'll check back later.<br> Where's Anna?<br> She's out to lunch with the girls.<br> I have to open a file.<br> Real-estate thing, pro bono.<br> -Okay.<br> -Know how to do that?<br> Yeah, I got it. No problem.<br> You're a girl.<br> Excuse me?<br> Why aren't you out to lunch<br> with the girls? You're a girl.<br> I guess l'm not the right kind.<br> Look, you may want to--<br> Now that you're working here--<br> You may want to rethink<br> your wardrobe a little.<br> Why is that?<br> Well, I think some of the girls<br> are a little uncomfortable...<br> ...because of what you wear.<br> Is that so?<br> Well, it just so happens,<br> I think I look nice.<br> As long as I have one ass<br> instead of two, l'll wear what I like...<br> ...if that's all right with you?<br> You might wanna rethink those ties.<br> With real-estate stuff, could you<br> remind me? l'm a little confused.<br> Why are there medical records<br> and blood samples in real-estate files?<br> You've been here long enough.<br> If you don't know how to do your job<br> by now, l'm not gonna do it for you.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Matthew? Katie?<br> Matthew? Katie?<br> Matthew!<br> What happened?<br> -Hi, Mom.<br> -Hey. Hungry?<br> Am l--?<br> They're here?<br> I went to pick them up.<br> She came by an hour ago. Something<br> came up, she dropped them off.<br> Something came up?<br> Why didn't she call?<br> I don't know. She, I was, she--<br> I don't know why.<br> -That stupid bitch.<br> -Mom!<br> I just can't believe she dumps<br> my kids off when nobody's home.<br> I was home.<br> We're fine. We cooked<br> burgers, had some milk.<br> You want a hot dog? There's one.<br> -Or a cheeseburger?<br> -But this mustard is slippery.<br> Mom, what do you think<br> about me getting a tattoo?<br> One, two, three.<br> I got all these kings.<br> You win, you got a joker.<br> King.<br> Joker.<br> You stole a joker!<br> You cheat.<br> What do you mean?<br> You cheat!<br> Get another one.<br> Time to go to bed.<br> Get ready for bed.<br> Brush your teeth.<br> -Play tomorrow?<br> -Yeah.<br> Good night, buddy.<br> What's that?<br> This is a Harley-Davidson,<br> the best motorcycle ever.<br> And if I ever catch either one of you<br> near one, knock you silly.<br> Brush. And keep it down,<br> the baby's asleep.<br> You got great kids.<br> Well, l'm sure<br> l'll fuck 'em up eventually.<br> Why?<br> I'm not a good judge of character,<br> or I wouldn't have left them...<br> ...with that idiot, who cost a lot<br> and smelled like chicken fat.<br> And after I find her and kill her...<br> ...l don't know what l'm gonna do.<br> If you need help with them,<br> I could do that.<br> -I'm not leaving my kids with you.<br> -Why?<br> -I don't even know you.<br> -What do you wanna know?<br> -Thanks for today--<br> -You're welcome.<br> It was my pleasure.<br> How many decks did you have?<br> We had more than enough.<br> Got so many friends<br> you can't use one more?<br> If you need someone to look after your<br> kids after school, or whatever...<br> ...l don't have a job now.<br> Oh, that's a great recommendation:<br> " l'm unemployed."<br> By choice.<br> I work when I need to.<br> What do you do?<br> Live off your trust fund?<br> I do construction, which pays good,<br> and I make it last by living cheap.<br> Is that supposed to impress me?<br> Hey. Bed.<br> Your little ghosts.<br> You always this hard on people<br> who try to help you?<br> I'm out of practice.<br> Well, let me remind you then.<br> The polite thing is to say thank you.<br> I'd start it off with that.<br> Then, " Hey, that's<br> a really nice offer.<br> I don't mind taking you up on that."<br> Why do you want to watch my kids?<br> -I like kids.<br> -Right.<br> I like hanging out with them.<br> They keep it simple.<br> You're home every afternoon?<br> I'm usually working on my bike.<br> If it doesn't work out, you can always<br> send them back to the chicken-fat lady.<br> This isn't gonna get you laid.<br> Get in bed.<br> Good, because I don't<br> find you attractive either.<br> Then we're even.<br> I'm so glad we got that<br> out of the way.<br> I feel much better.<br> I do too. Because now I can<br> just look after the kids...<br> ...and I don't have to worry<br> about you coming on to me.<br> Bring the phone into the changing room.<br> Of course they won't.<br> Mrs. Masry, don't be such a tease.<br> Hold on, just hold on. Yeah?<br> Sorry, would you mind<br> if I investigate this?<br> Investigate what?<br> This real-estate thing<br> with the Jensens. The pro bono.<br> I wanna make sure I understand<br> what l'm reading.<br> -Yeah, yeah, sure.<br> -You don't mind?<br> Okay, great. Thanks.<br> Donna Jensen?<br> I'm Erin Brockovich,<br> with Masry and Vititoe.<br> Oh! You're a lawyer?<br> Hell, no. I hate lawyers.<br> I just work for 'em.<br> Do you have a minute?<br> I don't mean to be a pain to PG&E<br> after all they've done for Hinkley...<br> ...but if they want this place,<br> they're gonna have to pay for it.<br> You didn't put the house up for sale.<br> They just wanted to buy it?<br> Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> Oh, I don't wanna move.<br> Uproot the kids?<br> I've got a couple of girls.<br> Honest to God, I don't know<br> if I have the energy.<br> You know, l've been sick.<br> Me and Pete both have.<br> The idea of selling, if they're<br> not gonna pay us properly...<br> ...l don't see the point.<br> Yeah, yeah, I can see that.<br> I guess the only thing<br> that confused me--<br> Not that your medical problems<br> aren't important.<br> How come those files are in<br> with all the real-estate stuff?<br> There's just so much correspondence,<br> I just keep it all in one place.<br> I'm sorry, I just don't see why you're<br> corresponding with PG&E...<br> ...about your medical problems<br> in the first place.<br> Well, they paid<br> for the doctor's visit.<br> They did?<br> You bet. Paid for a checkup<br> for the whole family.<br> Not like with insurance, where you pay<br> and maybe you see some money in a year.<br> They just took care of it.<br> Just like that.<br> We never saw a bill.<br> Wow. Why'd they do that?<br> The chromium.<br> -The what?<br> -The chromium.<br> Well, that's what<br> kicked this whole thing off.<br> -What kind of chromium?<br> -There's more than one?<br> There's straight-up chromium,<br> it does good things for the body.<br> There's chrom three,<br> which is fairly benign.<br> There's chrom six,<br> hexavalent chromium...<br> ...which, depending on the amounts,<br> can be harmful.<br> Harmful how? What would you get?<br> With repeated exposure<br> to toxic levels, anything...<br> ...from chronic headaches to respiratory<br> disease, liver failure...<br> ...heart failure, reproductive failure,<br> bone or organ deterioration.<br> Plus, of course, any type of cancer.<br> So that stuff, it kills people.<br> Yeah, definitely.<br> Highly toxic. Highly carcinogenic.<br> It gets into your DNA, so you pass<br> the trouble to your kids. Very bad.<br> Well, what's it used for?<br> A rust inhibitor.<br> The utility plants use piston engines<br> that get hot, they run water through.<br> Chromium's in the water<br> to prevent corrosion.<br> How do I find out what kind<br> of chromium they use in Hinkley?<br> -Been to their water board?<br> -What's that?<br> Every county has one.<br> They keep records of anything<br> in their jurisdiction.<br> -You should find something there.<br> -County water board.<br> -Alrighty. Well, thanks.<br> -Good luck.<br> I wouldn't advertise<br> what you're looking for.<br> Incriminating records have a way of<br> disappearing when people smell trouble.<br> I'll remember that. Thanks.<br> This guy's too smart.<br> It's only a matter of time<br> until he makes his move.<br> He positions women employees<br> in such a way...<br> ... that they have no choice<br> but to respond or lose theirjobs--<br> -That's a heavy door.<br> -Let me give you a hand.<br> Thank you very much. Aren't you<br> a gentleman, Mr...?<br> -Scott.<br> -Mr. Scott.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> I'm Erin.<br> Erin. Erin. Cool.<br> What can I do for you, Erin?<br> Believe it or not, l'm on the prowl<br> for some water records.<br> You come to the right place.<br> I guess I did.<br> Just tell me what you wanna look at,<br> and l'd be glad to dig 'em out.<br> I wish I knew. It's for my boss.<br> He's in this water dispute...<br> ...and he wants me to find all kinds<br> of papers, from all kinds of places.<br> You know,<br> it would probably be easiest...<br> ...if I squeezed back there<br> and poked around myself.<br> -Would that be all right with you?<br> -Come on back.<br> -I'm gonna need you to sign in here.<br> -Oh, sure.<br> -" Pattee," is that your middle name?<br> -No, maiden.<br> Oh, you're married?<br> Not anymore.<br> -Can I just...?<br> -Yeah.<br> I love your pants.<br> Oh, well, yeah, thanks.<br> Well, this is it.<br> It's impressive.<br> I'll call you if I need anything.<br> -All right.<br> -Okay.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Okay.<br> Where's my stuff?<br> Where have you been?<br> Where the fuck is my stuff?<br> Don't you use language<br> like that with--<br> Someone took my stuff.<br> -Nice to see you.<br> -I had photos of my kids--<br> Toothbrush, toothpaste,<br> mousse and deodorant.<br> What's going on?<br> This isn't a job where you<br> can disappear for days at a time.<br> You don't do the work,<br> you don't get to stay.<br> All l've been doing is working.<br> Ask Mr. Masry.<br> You ask Mr. Masry. He fired you.<br> You said to fire me?<br> I'll call you back.<br> You've been gone for a week.<br> I left a message. I was gonna<br> write a whole damn report.<br> That's not how we work. You don't<br> leave a message and take off.<br> -Want me to check in every second?<br> -It's called accountability.<br> I'm not talking to you, bitch!<br> That's enough!<br> Look, Erin, this incident aside,<br> I don't think this is the right...<br> ...place for you.<br> So l'm gonna make a few calls,<br> find you something else.<br> Don't bother.<br> I'm trying to help.<br> You're trying not to feel guilty<br> about firing someone with 3 kids.<br> Fuck if l'm gonna help you do that.<br> Get back to work!<br> What the hell are you doing here?<br> I'm fixing the leak.<br> Damn it, I don't ask you<br> to do things like that.<br> Look at this mess that you've made.<br> -I'm not done with that yet.<br> -Well, get it out.<br> -Relax.<br> -Shit! Where did it go?<br> Where is it?<br> Back there.<br> Behind your foot.<br> -Going up your leg now.<br> -Jesus!<br> Who fucking lives like this, George?<br> Who lets their kids run around in a<br> place with bugs the size of house cats?<br> All you have to do<br> is call an exterminator.<br> I can't call an exterminator.<br> I can't afford one.<br> I can't even afford my phone.<br> I got fired.<br> What?<br> What do you mean, you got fired?<br> You're working so hard.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> Doesn't make one fucking bit<br> of difference.<br> I don't know what happened to me.<br> I mean....<br> God, I was Miss Wichita,<br> for chrissake.<br> Did I tell you that?<br> You are living next door to a real,<br> live fucking beauty queen.<br> I still have my tiara.<br> And I thought it meant I was gonna<br> do something important with my life.<br> That it meant I was someone.<br> You're someone to me.<br> Are you gonna be something else<br> that I have to survive?<br> Because l'll tell you the truth...<br> ...l'm not up to it.<br> I get up in the centre of the stage...<br> ...and I have the big<br> bouquet of flowers.<br> I had my foot out like this,<br> and I said:<br> " I will devote my entire reign<br> as Miss Wichita...<br> ...to bringing an end to world hunger.<br> And to the creation<br> of a peaceful earth...<br> ...for every man, woman and child."<br> -How long were you Miss Wichita?<br> -One year.<br> By the time I got through<br> opening new supermarkets...<br> ...l only had a few weeks left<br> to work on hunger...<br> -...and world peace.<br> -World peace.<br> I don't know what I was thinking.<br> What about you, huh?<br> What about me?<br> Let me tell you something.<br> Let me get that out of your hair.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Nice.<br> You're a very special lady.<br> Don't be too nice to me, okay?<br> Why?<br> Makes me nervous.<br> It's some slim pickings here, baby.<br> Maybe that's Ed McMahon.<br> Let's go see.<br> Wrong Ed.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I had an interesting call<br> this afternoon from Dr. Frankel...<br> -...from UCLA.<br> -Oh, yeah?<br> He wanted you to know that the " legal<br> limit for hexavalent chromium...<br> ...is .05 parts per million...<br> ...and at the rate you mentioned,<br> .58, it could be...<br> ...responsible for the cancers"<br> in that family you asked about...<br> ...the Jensens.<br> Well. Wasn't that nice of him?<br> Funny how some people help people,<br> and others just fire them.<br> I'm sorry. You were gone.<br> I assumed you were off having fun.<br> Why the hell would you assume that?<br> Maybe you look like someone<br> who has a lot of fun.<br> By that standard,<br> I assume you never get laid.<br> I'm married.<br> Look, what is this-- What's the story<br> on this cancer stuff?<br> You wanna know, you have to hire me<br> back. I got a ton of bills to pay.<br> Fine.<br> Fine.<br> Donna just put in these new cabinets,<br> stained the wood and all...<br> ...when she gets a call from PG&E,<br> saying a freeway's gonna be built...<br> ...and they wanna buy her house<br> for an off-ramp.<br> The husband's sick with Hodgkin's.<br> She keeps getting tumours...<br> ...believing one has nothing<br> to do with the other.<br> Because PG&E told her<br> about the chromium?<br> They had a seminar.<br> They invited 200 people<br> from the area...<br> ...had it at the plant...<br> ...about chromium three<br> and how good it is...<br> ...when they're using chromium six.<br> That document you found<br> at the water board...<br> ...the one that says<br> about the bad chromium....<br> You didn't happen to make a copy,<br> did you?<br> Of course I did.<br> Could I have a look?<br> I want a raise.<br> And benefits, including dental.<br> It's not how I do business.<br> -What way is that?<br> -Extortion.<br> A 5% raise, we'll talk<br> about benefits later.<br> Ten. There are lots of other places<br> I could get work.<br> I'm drawing the line.<br> He's drawing the line.<br> This the only thing you got?<br> Well, the place is a pigsty.<br> There's probably more.<br> I know how those things are run.<br> What makes you think<br> you can just walk in there...<br> ...and find what we need?<br> They're called boobs, Ed.<br> Yes, l'm sure it is.<br> I understand.<br> I agree. I agree. I'm going to.<br> Right now.<br> I'm almost done. Look.<br> How are we doing?<br> We're doing great.<br> Good.<br> Well, you've got quite a lot<br> done already. So....<br> Sorry, we need to have<br> those records back now.<br> No.<br> These papers are public record.<br> I'm not leaving...<br> ...until they're copied.<br> Fax these to this number, okay?<br> -All of them?<br> -All of them.<br> An on-site monitoring well?<br> -That means it was--<br> -It's on the PG&E property.<br> And you say that this stuff,<br> this hexavalent chromium....<br> -Well, it's poisonous.<br> -Yeah.<br> It's gotta be different than what's<br> in our water, because ours is okay.<br> The guys from PG&E told me.<br> They sat right in the kitchen<br> and told me that it was fine.<br> I know. But the toxicologist<br> that l've been talking to...<br> ...he gave me a list of problems that<br> come from hexavalent chromium exposure.<br> Everything you all have<br> is on that list.<br> No, no, no.<br> That's not what--<br> That's not what our doctor said.<br> He said that....<br> Well, that one's got absolutely<br> nothing to do with the other.<br> But PG&E paid for that doctor.<br> Ashley!<br> Shanna!<br> Get out of the pool!<br> -How come?<br> -I said so, that's why.<br> The minute Brenda sent that fax...<br> ...l'm saying, the second she<br> pressed the "send" button...<br> ...PG&E's claim department<br> was on the phone to me...<br> ...scheduling a meeting.<br> So you think that--<br> Let me do it.<br> You're driving me nuts.<br> You think we scared them?<br> Taking the trouble to send someone...<br> ...sounds like they're<br> sitting up and taking notice.<br> Mr. Foil?<br> In the interest<br> of putting this to rest...<br> ...PG&E is willing to offer<br> the Jensens $250,000 for their home.<br> $250,000?<br> In terms of land value in Hinkley...<br> ...we feel that's a more<br> than fair price.<br> How about in terms<br> of medical expenses?<br> $250,000 isn't gonna come close to what<br> this family's gonna spend on doctors.<br> I understand they've had bad luck,<br> health-wise.<br> They have my sympathies.<br> But that's not PG&E's fault.<br> You're kidding, right?<br> Look at these readings.<br> PG&E's own technicians documented...<br> ...toxic levels of hexavalent chromium<br> in those wells...<br> ...on numerous occasions.<br> Everything the Jensens have had...<br> ...is proven reaction to exposure to<br> hexavalent chromium. They have had....<br> They have had....<br> Breast cysts, uterine cancer,<br> Hodgkin's, immune deficiencies...<br> ...asthma, nosebleeds--<br> A million things could<br> cause those problems.<br> Poor diet, bad genes,<br> irresponsible lifestyle.<br> Our offer is final<br> and more than fair.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I thought we were negotiating here.<br> $250,000 is all<br> l'm authorized to offer.<br> I'll present your offer to my clients.<br> I doubt they'll accept.<br> Before you go off on a crusade...<br> ...remember who you're dealing with.<br> PG&E's a 28 billion<br> dollar corporation.<br> I didn't know it was that much!<br> Wow! Twenty-eight billion!<br> Holy cow!<br> They made an offer.<br> No, a million would have been<br> an offer. They send that...<br> ...mail clerk down to jerk me off,<br> waste my time.<br> Why?<br> You heard what that kid said.<br> They have 28 billion dollars.<br> They can afford to waste time.<br> -You can't?<br> -Am I made of money?<br> -Why are you yelling?<br> -I'm pissed.<br> -Fuck you!<br> -Fuck you back!<br> I really hate you sometimes.<br> No. You love me.<br> You've been reading for hours.<br> I'm a slow reader.<br> Excuse me.<br> -Are you Erin Brockovich?<br> -Yeah.<br> I'm Tom Robinson.<br> This is my wife, Mandy.<br> We used to live across<br> the street from the Jensens.<br> I think you know Donna.<br> PG&E bought our house last year.<br> Well, the vet said they had<br> a bunch of tumours and stuff.<br> Well, you can see<br> they couldn't really walk.<br> How many were born like this?<br> Twelve or 1 3 or so.<br> When Donna told us what<br> you told her about the chromium...<br> ...we figured it might have<br> something to do with this.<br> Yeah, it might.<br> Really, may I keep these?<br> -Yeah.<br> -Okay, great.<br> Thank you so much.<br> I really appreciate it.<br> There's something else too.<br> What?<br> Mandy, here, has had...<br> ...five miscarriages.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I figured it was something I did.<br> Like, when I smoked marijuana,<br> maybe...<br> ...or took birth control pills...<br> ...but then Donna<br> said that you thought...<br> ...this chromium might be<br> to blame for her problems.<br> So I figured maybe...<br> ...it wasn't just me.<br> I have to take a bath.<br> You should go in.<br> They're not asleep?<br> Beth and Katie are.<br> -How was school?<br> -Fine.<br> -Did you do your homework?<br> -Yeah.<br> Any problems?<br> I know you're upset,<br> but the way this job is...<br> ...things come up at the last minute.<br> Things that I gotta deal with.<br> Fine!<br> Please don't be mad at me.<br> I'm doing this for us. I know<br> it's hard for you to understand...<br> ...but don't you want Mommy<br> to be good at her job?<br> I don't miss dinner all the time.<br> We all ate together last night.<br> You were reading the whole time.<br> There's something about this thing<br> I don't understand, Mr. Masry.<br> If PG&E messed with our water...<br> ...why would they say anything<br> about it to us at all?<br> Why not just keep quiet about it?<br> To establish a statute of limitations.<br> In a case like this,<br> you only have one year...<br> ...from the time you learn about<br> the problem to file suit.<br> So PG&E figures...<br> ..."We'll let the cat out of the bag.<br> Tell them the water isn't perfect.<br> If we can ride out the year<br> with no one suing...<br> ...we'll be in the clear forever."<br> But they told us more than a year ago.<br> -That's okay. We're not suing.<br> -Not yet.<br> All we're doing<br> is using this information...<br> ...to get you a nice purchase<br> price on your house.<br> And you two, a comparable<br> retroactive bonus on your sale price.<br> PG&E still looks good<br> to their shareholders.<br> They're not in a lawsuit.<br> All they're doing is buying property.<br> Doesn't say how much<br> this thing's gonna cost us.<br> My fee is 40% of whatever<br> you get awarded.<br> Boy, do I know how you feel.<br> The first time I heard that number,<br> I said, "You're kidding me."<br> Forty goddamned percent?<br> I'm the one that's injured, and<br> this joker sits at a desk all day...<br> ...and he wants<br> almost half of my reward?<br> -Erin, can l--?<br> -But then...<br> ...l asked him...<br> ...what he makes<br> if I don't get anything.<br> Then I don't get anything either.<br> Plus, he's out all the costs.<br> So I realized...<br> ...he's taking a chance too.<br> You got a pen, honey?<br> All right, then.<br> Oh, I made a bundt cake.<br> Who would like coffee and cake?<br> -I do.<br> -Thanks, but we have to get back.<br> Have a fucking cup of coffee, Ed.<br> Coffee will be great. Thank you.<br> -All right.<br> -I'll help you.<br> My wife makes really good bundt cake.<br> I love bundt cake.<br> Well, it seems like everybody in<br> the family ended up with a rash somehow.<br> It seemed like no matter what<br> we did, it always came back.<br> Over what kind of period of time?<br> Oh, long time, you know, years.<br> I never did keep track of it.<br> Kids are sick.<br> Animals need to be fed.<br> Just couldn't get rid of it.<br> Well, Mrs. De Soto said...<br> ...that she wasn't<br> exactly sure what you had.<br> We know what it is.<br> -It's gastrointestinal--<br> -Gastrointestinal cancer.<br> -She got sick about nine months ago--<br> -Nine months ago.<br> And they operated on her<br> about six months ago.<br> -The intestine.<br> -Right.<br> -Hi. I'm Erin Brock--<br> -I know who you are.<br> Donna called me.<br> Can I come in?<br> We're not interested<br> in getting involved.<br> Can I ask why?<br> What's the point?<br> Donna told me that you've been sick<br> and that your kids were sick--<br> You people don't give a shit.<br> Anything to get what you want.<br> Thanks for having me--<br> It's a good day to come by.<br> She's feeling good.<br> Well, Mike Ambrosino had remembered...<br> ...that he had seen<br> you folks at the hospital.<br> That's what brought me out here.<br> Yeah, we've been there<br> from time to time.<br> And you! Wooftie!<br> Ain't you a beauty?<br> You drive all the boys<br> crazy, don't you?<br> I can see it in your eyes.<br> You drive them wild.<br> You do, don't you?<br> Torture them.<br> It's good for them.<br> Don't teach her anything too early.<br> Yeah, she can't wait<br> to get on her new dress.<br> She wants to go to school.<br> We're trying to do that,<br> in a few months.<br> Yeah, get her out<br> of her nightgown here.<br> She's gonna do it.<br> Absolutely not.<br> -Why not?<br> -Because I said no.<br> The reason PG&E even talks to us...<br> ...is because this is a quiet<br> real-estate dispute.<br> We add plaintiffs, we're in<br> the middle of a toxic-trot...<br> ...with a statute problem,<br> against a massive utility.<br> No, thank you.<br> Okay, so here's what l'll do.<br> I'll go to the Daniels',<br> the nicest people you'll ever meet...<br> ...who watch their girl fight<br> like a dog against cancer.<br> I'll tell them...<br> ...we can't help them, because you<br> just don't wanna work that hard.<br> Work hard?<br> Let me tell you something.<br> I've worked all my life.<br> I've built a firm and kept it alive<br> through lawsuits and injunctions.<br> I've survived<br> a quadruple bypass, cancer...<br> ...being born with one<br> kidney and diabetes.<br> I personally managed<br> to save a million dollars...<br> ...over 30 years, getting<br> clients 1 0 times that.<br> Don't tell me I don't work hard!<br> Don't tell me I can't stop,<br> take a breath and enjoy life.<br> What the hell do you know<br> about any of this?<br> Something like this, Erin,<br> it could take forever.<br> They're a huge corporation!<br> They'll bury us<br> in paperwork for years.<br> I'm just a guy with<br> a small, private firm!<br> Who knows they poisoned<br> people and lied about it.<br> We can get these people.<br> With a little effort, I think we<br> can nail their asses to the wall.<br> With your legal expertise,<br> you believe that?<br> -Don't you ever just know?<br> -Do you know about money?<br> They settle due to lack of money.<br> You know what toxicologists<br> and geology experts cost?<br> We're looking at $1 00,000 a month.<br> -I've already spent some of my savings.<br> -We'll figure it out.<br> I don't know shit, but I know the<br> difference between right and wrong!<br> -Lovers' quarrel?<br> -Bite my ass, Krispy Kreme.<br> I feel you looking at me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> How many families are we talking about?<br> Four more. Eleven people so far.<br> There's more?<br> I found a document at the water board,<br> a toxic test well reading from 1 967.<br> More people have lived<br> there since then.<br> This is a whole different ball game.<br> A much bigger deal.<br> Kind of like David<br> and what's-his-name.<br> Kind of like David and what's-<br> his-name's whole fucking family.<br> Here's the deal.<br> If, and only if, you find all the<br> evidence to back this up, l'll do it.<br> You're doing the right thing.<br> Remind me of that when<br> l'm filing for bankruptcy.<br> Of course, gathering<br> evidence is a big job.<br> Hell of a lot bigger than just filing.<br> I'll be working a lot harder...<br> ...taking on a lot<br> more responsibility.<br> -I don't believe this.<br> -A raise wouldn't hurt.<br> I'll spend more time in my car...<br> ...so l'll probably be needing<br> one of those cell phones.<br> -I don't believe this.<br> -Just a little phone.<br> Thank you!<br> Whoever is behind you.<br> Just play.<br> Go, roll the dice and play.<br> Come on, aren't you gonna play?<br> Roll the dice.<br> Come on.<br> Hello.<br> Is this the Erin Brockovich that's<br> been snooping around the water board?<br> Yeah. Who's this?<br> You should watch your step.<br> A young lady with three young<br> children really should think again.<br> Who is this?<br> Do you understand what l'm saying?<br> Who is it?<br> It's okay.<br> I'm not gonna quit because of<br> one creepy phone call, George.<br> Come on, Erin.<br> A job shouldn't put you in danger.<br> I'm not in danger.<br> -The phone might be tapped but--<br> -What?<br> That's usual. We've got a dead<br> bolt, it's not a big deal.<br> You don't think you're<br> a little out of your league?<br> That's what those PG&E<br> fucks want me to think.<br> But they're wrong.<br> Erin, there are plenty<br> of jobs out there.<br> How would you know?<br> What that's supposed to mean?<br> You got a problem with me caring<br> for your kids instead of a job?<br> I can get a job.<br> You can leave the kids with<br> the chicken-fat lady again.<br> I said l'm sorry.<br> Keep your voice down.<br> I know what these kids can<br> sleep through, better than you.<br> Scott, tell me something.<br> Does PG&E pay you<br> to cover their ass?<br> Or do you just do it out<br> of the kindness of your heart?<br> I don't know what<br> you're talking about.<br> Nobody calls me Pattee.<br> That sicko that called could've<br> only found out about me from you.<br> People are dying, Scott.<br> You've got document after document...<br> ...that says why, and you<br> haven't said one word about it.<br> I wanna know how the hell<br> you sleep at night.<br> I'm about to drive off the road,<br> l'm so tired. Keep me awake.<br> What do you want, a joke?<br> No, I don't want a joke.<br> Tell me about what went on back there.<br> Come to think of it,<br> we had a big event around here.<br> Beth started talking.<br> What?<br> Beth? My Beth?<br> We were sitting around...<br> ...and she pointed<br> at a ball and said:<br> " Ball."<br> Out of the blue like that.<br> It was pretty intense.<br> You know, seeing<br> somebody's first word.<br> Of all the words in her life,<br> that's the first word she says.: "ball. "<br> She pointed her little finger...<br> ... with her beautiful, soft,<br> chubby little arm...<br> ...and her cheeks.<br> It's like she'd been<br> looking at it for months...<br> ...and couldn't get it out,<br> but knowing what it was.<br> She didn't look away or anything.<br> She was just sitting<br> there with her arm out.<br> You should've seen<br> Matthew and Katie and me.<br> Ourjaws just dropped.<br> We must've stood there for three or<br> four minutes andjust looked at her.<br> She just had her arm out<br> like that. "Ball. "<br> And, you know, her little<br> lips wrapped around it.<br> It was great.<br> It was intense.<br> I brought some stuff that<br> you might be interested in.<br> My name's Erin, and<br> l'll be here all day.<br> Let's go over to these<br> nice ladies. Hi.<br> -How are you?<br> -Good.<br> I brought some information today,<br> if you wanna have a look at it.<br> If you have any<br> questions, let me know.<br> Hi. Excuse me, ladies, l'm Ed Masry.<br> I'm the lawyer involved in the case.<br> You might like to read these.<br> If you have questions,<br> l'm here all day.<br> -Sounds good. Thank you.<br> -Thanks so much.<br> Is your phone number in this?<br> There's more important<br> information than that in there.<br> I'm bored.<br> So are the kids.<br> I'm a little busy, honey.<br> We invited these people.<br> Ed and I have to--<br> I'm sorry. You know what?<br> Please, I have an idea.<br> Can you take her?<br> She's getting heavy, and l'll<br> work faster if you take her.<br> Got a knee for me?<br> -Hello.<br> -Hello, sweetness.<br> -Guess what?<br> -What?<br> I would like to go home.<br> Everything's done?<br> We got a lot done.<br> Did you? I think<br> I ate three watermelons.<br> Piggyback!<br> Let's go, brother. Get on.<br> Careful.<br> Here, get on me, now.<br> Erin, excuse me.<br> This is Nelson Perez, he works<br> at the compressor station.<br> -Hi, nice to meet you.<br> -PG&E.<br> Oh, hi.<br> -I've come at a bad time.<br> -No.<br> -Can you just give me one--?<br> -Of course. Sure.<br> Thank you.<br> You know what?<br> Why don't you guys go ahead without<br> me, and l'll get a ride with Ed.<br> -No, Mom.<br> -No, sweetie, l'll be right behind you.<br> I'll be right behind you, all right?<br> -I really-- This is so--<br> -Fine. Go, go, go.<br> Get down, bud.<br> Hang on tight there.<br> Help your sister<br> with her shoes. Let's go.<br> This is so helpful.<br> Is it okay if I write this down?<br> I have so many questions.<br> I wanna know about how the plant works<br> and the cooling towers, just everything.<br> I wanna know about how the plant works<br> and the cooling towers, just everything.<br> They use the hexachrome here, in these<br> cooling towers, as an anticorrosive.<br> Then they dump the excess<br> water into these ponds.<br> I don't remember seeing<br> any ponds up there.<br> They've been covered over,<br> and not too carefully.<br> If you dig one inch<br> under the surface...<br> ...dirt's as green<br> as a fucking shamrock.<br> And that's what<br> caused the contamination?<br> It didn't help, but no.<br> The problem started on the bottom.<br> According to...<br> ...this...<br> ...in most cases you would<br> line these ponds...<br> ...so the shit didn't seep<br> into the ground.<br> -But guess what?<br> -They skipped that step?<br> Here are the ponds,<br> the plume comes down...<br> ...and Hinkley is down here...<br> ...it's 1 4 years of hexachrome<br> flowing into the groundwater.<br> Jesus.<br> This guy just offered<br> all this information?<br> Well, yeah. Nelson cares<br> what's in those ponds.<br> He used to spend time wading<br> around them. That was his job.<br> Shit.<br> What's the matter?<br> I don't know if we can pull this off.<br> This is a monster case.<br> We're up to 41 1 plaintiffs.<br> We've taken 1 62 declarations.<br> Probably hundreds more<br> out there have moved away.<br> We have to find them,<br> it's taking time.<br> Money's going out,<br> nothing's coming in.<br> I have to take a second mortgage.<br> -So?<br> -So!<br> I have to tell you.<br> I've been making inquiries<br> with other firms...<br> ...bigger firms to share<br> some of the cost.<br> They all said no,<br> said they don't have it.<br> We got PG&E by the balls.<br> PG&E Hinkley, but nobody'll get rich<br> unless we pin this on Corporate...<br> -...in San Francisco.<br> -What do you mean?<br> PG&E Corporate claims they<br> didn't know about Hinkley.<br> They knew. They had to know.<br> Show me the document to prove it.<br> Then they didn't know. If so, we<br> can't hit them with punitive damages.<br> With punitive damages,<br> it's a sum of money that can...<br> ...have some effect<br> on these people's lives.<br> So what do we do now?<br> Let's assume there are documents<br> connecting PG&E Hinkley and Corporate...<br> ...and they know about them.<br> We take our 400 or so plaintiffs<br> and everything you've dug up...<br> ...we file a lawsuit<br> to provoke a reaction.<br> See if they offer a reasonable<br> settlement, or throw more paper at us.<br> Sounds great. Let's do that.<br> There's a downside.<br> PG&E will submit a demurrer.<br> A list attacking each complaint...<br> ...claiming that each cause<br> of action has no merit.<br> And if the judge agrees with them...<br> ...he'll dismiss our case.<br> PG&E will have no reason to settle.<br> Then it's all over.<br> So basically it all comes down to...<br> ...what this one judge decides.<br> Basically, yeah.<br> Jesus.<br> Well, l'd got so used<br> to having them come up benign.<br> Guess I just didn't expect it.<br> I sure wish I would've had longer<br> to get used to the idea.<br> You think if you got no uterus...<br> ...and no breasts...<br> ...you're still technically a woman?<br> Sure you are.<br> Yeah, you just--<br> You're actually a happier woman.<br> No need to worry<br> about maxi-pads and underwire.<br> We're gonna get them, aren't we?<br> You gotta promise me<br> that we're gonna get them.<br> I have before me<br> a complaint on behalf of residents...<br> ... of Hinkley, California, who<br> have filed against PG&E.<br> For damages, medical expenses<br> and personal trauma...<br> ...due to contamination of the ground<br> water in their area by the defendant.<br> And I have here 84 motions<br> to strike and demurrers...<br> ...submitted by representatives<br> of Pacific Gas & Electric.<br> Each one attacking<br> the validity of this complaint.<br> I have reviewed all of<br> the information carefully.<br> I'm ready to give my decision.<br> Before I do, is there<br> anything anyone wants to say?<br> -No, Your Honour.<br> -No, Your Honour.<br> Very well.<br> In the matter of the plaintiffs<br> of Hinkley, California vs. PG&E...<br> ...it is the order of this court that<br> each of the 84 motions to strike...<br> ...and demurrers are denied.<br> And the causes of action against<br> Pacific Gas and Electric are upheld.<br> On a more personal note...<br> ...as a resident here in Barstow,<br> which is not far from Hinkley...<br> ...l am disturbed by reference...<br> ...to evidence that suggests that not<br> only was hexavalent chromium used...<br> ...but that your clients<br> actually sent these residents...<br> ...pamphlets telling them<br> that it was good for them.<br> Tell your clients<br> they're going to trial.<br> Jesus. They look<br> like the Secret Service.<br> Intimidation.<br> Let the games begin.<br> Show them into the conference room.<br> Donald, Anna...<br> ...l wanna talk to you for a minute.<br> Counsellors.<br> Counsellors.<br> Let's be honest.<br> $20,000,000 is more than<br> these people have ever dreamed of.<br> Now that pisses me off.<br> First of all, since the demurrer,<br> we have more than 400 plaintiffs.<br> Let's be honest, we know there's more.<br> They may not be sophisticated,<br> but they can divide...<br> ...and $20,000,000<br> isn't shit after splitting it.<br> Second of all...<br> ...they don't dream of being rich.<br> They dream about<br> watching their kids in a pool...<br> ...without worrying that<br> they'll have a hysterectomy at 20.<br> Like Rosa Diaz, our client.<br> Or have their spine deteriorate, like<br> Stan Bloom, another client of ours.<br> So before you come back here<br> with another lame-ass offer...<br> ...l want you to think real<br> hard about what your spine is worth.<br> Or what you expect someone<br> to pay you for your uterus.<br> Then take out your calculator<br> and multiply that number by 1 00.<br> Anything less than that<br> is a waste of our time.<br> We had that water brought<br> in special for you folks.<br> Came from Hinkley.<br> I think this meeting's over.<br> Damn right it is.<br> What the fuck? Did a bomb blow up?<br> You letting the kids run wild?<br> What's that?<br> I saw them in a mall one day.<br> I said, " Damn...<br> ...they'll look good on<br> those beautiful ears."<br> I bought them and I said, "When Erin<br> does something nice, l'll surprise her."<br> You know how long ago that was?<br> Six months ago.<br> -I'm sorry, l've just--<br> -And so what l'm thinking is....<br> Either you gotta find<br> a different job or a different guy.<br> I mean....<br> There may be many men out there<br> who don't mind being the maid...<br> ...and getting nothing.<br> But I ain't one of them.<br> I can't leave my job, George.<br> Yes, you can.<br> People do it all the time.<br> How can you ask me to do that?<br> This job....<br> For the first time in my<br> life, I got people respecting me.<br> Up in Hinkley...<br> ...l walk into a room, everybody shuts<br> up to hear what I have to say.<br> I never had that before, ever.<br> Please, don't ask me to give it up.<br> What about your kids?<br> I'm doing more for them now<br> than I did living with my parents.<br> One day they'll see it.<br> -Well, what about me?<br> -What about you?<br> You think the men<br> who gave me those children...<br> ...asked me what I<br> wanted before walking away?<br> All l've ever done<br> is bend my life around...<br> ...what men decide they need.<br> Well, not now.<br> I'm sorry. I won't do it.<br> Well....<br> Erin, l'm not them. So....<br> What more can I do<br> to prove that to you?<br> Stay.<br> What for?<br> I mean, you got a raise.<br> You can afford daycare.<br> You don't need me.<br> Hi.<br> We can get them, Pamela.<br> We can.<br> I don't wanna feel it all over again...<br> ...and then not have it come out right.<br> I don't know if I could handle that.<br> Put the kids through that.<br> The thing is, it doesn't matter<br> whether you win, lose or draw here.<br> You were lied to. You're sick and your<br> kids are sick because of those lies.<br> You all have to come together...<br> ...to stand up in<br> a courtroom and say that.<br> I'd bring the kids<br> into the hospital...<br> ...with towels soaked<br> from their nosebleeds.<br> They called County Services because<br> they assumed the kids were abused.<br> Am I gonna get the best<br> behaviour in the office?<br> No.<br> What's with the attitude?<br> I just need cool, I need quiet.<br> Hello. Am I alone in the car? Yes?<br> -I don't understand why--<br> -I don't wanna talk about it now.<br> -The other moms gave permission.<br> -I don't care.<br> -So when can I get a friggin' answer?<br> -Don't talk to me like that!<br> Randy's mom said yes.<br> Goddamn it, Randy's mom doesn't<br> work, and his dad didn't leave her!<br> Figuring out who<br> takes him to roller hockey...<br> ...is probably easier at<br> Randy's house. Now cool it.<br> I'll be as quick as I can.<br> Matthew, can you watch your sister?<br> -Matthew.<br> -All right, fine. Come here, Beth.<br> -Can I come with you?<br> -No, baby, l'll just be a second.<br> Thank you. I'm only<br> sorry you couldn't meet Erin.<br> -I will.<br> -You will.<br> We have a lot of work to do together.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Erin, I was just talking about you.<br> Meet our new partner, Kurt Potter.<br> He'll handle Hinkley.<br> I see what you mean<br> about a secret weapon.<br> Erin, it's great to meet you.<br> You've done a fabulous job.<br> -I'll be seeing you.<br> -Thanks, I appreciate you coming over.<br> What?<br> Our new partner?<br> When was I gonna hear about this?<br> Just listen. Did I ever tell<br> you about that airline case?<br> What the fuck are you talking about?<br> A few years back, I was<br> trying this airline case...<br> ...and I got my ass kicked by this<br> guy. He buried me in paper, brutal.<br> He's the toughest<br> l'd ever been up against.<br> Make a point!<br> It was Kurt Potter.<br> After the judge's decision, I asked<br> him to partner, he didn't hesitate.<br> He wouldn't hesitate now, we did<br> all the work. Where was he before?<br> Will you listen to me?<br> It doesn't matter.<br> You wanna win this?<br> He gave me this check.<br> It covers all our expenses to date...<br> ...and he's got more toxic<br> tort experience than anyone.<br> This is good news!<br> I got Pamela Duncan.<br> I'll open, Mommy.<br> You wanna open the can for<br> Mommy? Well, here, l'll help you.<br> You turn it?<br> -Hi, George.<br> -Hi, George. Let's go see.<br> Erin Brockovich?<br> Package from Masry and Vititoe.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Thank you.<br> -What's in here?<br> -Baby.<br> There's no baby in here.<br> -What is it?<br> -A dolly.<br> It's a dolly? lt's--<br> Lookit.<br> " Lookit" is right.<br> Do you see that?<br> -I want that.<br> -I want that too.<br> It's our lucky day.<br> Matthew, Katie!<br> PG&E has requested that we<br> submit to binding arbitration.<br> What's that?<br> That's where we try the case<br> without a jury, before a judge.<br> It's called a test trial.<br> The judge's decision<br> is final. There's no appeal.<br> -How many plaintiffs do you have?<br> -634.<br> They'll never try<br> that many all at once.<br> So we need to get them together<br> in groups of 20 or 30.<br> Worst cases, the most life-threatened,<br> the sickest first and so on.<br> Each one gets a go before<br> the judge to determine damages.<br> PG&E proposes that they're liable...<br> ...anywhere between<br> So wait a minute. Let<br> me just get this straight.<br> If we went to trial...<br> ...PG&E could stretch this over<br> -Those people would--<br> -These people expect a trial.<br> That's what we told them, you<br> and me. They won't understand this.<br> Kurt thinks it's the best way to go.<br> Look, I promise you that we'll<br> be very sensitive on this point.<br> We'll make sure they see...<br> ...that this is the only way<br> we can go forward at this time.<br> But we have a lot of work to do...<br> ...before we even broach that subject.<br> I'll take Erin down the hall...<br> ...so we can start on this stuff,<br> and l'll fill her in on the details.<br> -Those are my files.<br> -Yeah. We had them couriered over.<br> Listen, good work.<br> They're a great start.<br> We'll just spend some time<br> filling in the holes in your research.<br> Excuse me-- Theresa, is it?<br> There are no holes in my research.<br> There are things we need<br> you probably didn't know to ask.<br> Don't talk to me like l'm an idiot.<br> I spent 1 8 months on this case...<br> ...and I know more about<br> the plaintiffs than you ever will.<br> You don't even have phone numbers.<br> Whose number do you need?<br> Everyone's. We need to be<br> able to contact the plaintiffs.<br> I said whose number do you need?<br> You don't know 600 numbers by heart.<br> Annabelle Daniels.<br> Annabelle Daniels. 71 4-454-9346.<br> Ten years old. Lived<br> on the plume since birth.<br> Wanted to be a synchronized swimmer,<br> so she spent every minute in the pool.<br> They detected a tumour in her brain.<br> An operation shrunk it,<br> with radiation after that.<br> Her parents are Ted and Rita.<br> Ted's got Crohn's disease. Rita has<br> headaches and underwent a hysterectomy.<br> Ted grew up in Hinkley. His<br> brother and his wife and their kids...<br> ...Robbie Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose<br> and Peter also lived on the plume.<br> Their number is 454-9554.<br> You want their diseases?<br> I think we got off on the wrong foot.<br> That's all you got, lady, two<br> wrong feet in fucking ugly shoes.<br> -She insulted me.<br> -Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding.<br> Instead of being polite and<br> treating her with respect--<br> Why should I respect her?<br> Just because she's not supporting kids<br> with no husband, she's not an idiot!<br> Just because she<br> dresses like a lawyer...<br> ...doesn't mean she didn't<br> work her ass off in law school.<br> Excuse me for not going to law school.<br> Law school? At this point,<br> I'd settle for charm school!<br> Mr. Linwood!<br> Bob?<br> ...Hinkley, California. 71 4...<br> ...455....<br> Okay, now, if you<br> could walk me through...<br> ...all of the elements<br> of Annabelle's illnesses.<br> Specific details...<br> ...when the symptoms began,<br> prior to the first medical visit.<br> If you could reserve sentimental<br> embellishments, I'd appreciate it...<br> ...because they won't<br> help you in court.<br> I just need facts, dates, time.<br> I know Theresa isn't real<br> warm, but she's a good lawyer.<br> She asks the same questions<br> you did. I told you everything.<br> I don't want her coming to the<br> house again. She upsets Annabelle.<br> Okay, if you don't like<br> Theresa, that's okay.<br> You know how important<br> Annabelle is to me.<br> Ed and I are still here for you.<br> I called Ed two days ago, Erin.<br> He still hasn't called me back.<br> Now, I hate to say this, but...<br> ...everyone's upset<br> about this arbitration thing.<br> What?<br> Pamela has written a letter...<br> ...telling everybody<br> to get new lawyers.<br> That we've been lied to.<br> -Is it true?<br> -No.<br> Did you?<br> I'm telling you the truth, and<br> I'll get to the bottom of all of this.<br> Don't lie to us.<br> I will take care of this.<br> -Now, we're trusting you here, so....<br> -Thanks.<br> I'll talk to you soon, okay?<br> I'm not saying<br> it's not a strong case.<br> Otherwise, they wouldn't have dropped<br> the demurrers. I wouldn't be here.<br> What I am saying is, we<br> don't have a smoking gun...<br> ...that ties San Francisco to Hinkley.<br> Something that<br> proves that prior to 1 987...<br> ...PG&E Corporate knew the water was<br> bad there and did nothing about it.<br> -Erin, I thought you took a sick day.<br> -So did l.<br> -What's going on in there?<br> -Meeting about the PG&E thing.<br> -Are you sure?<br> -Yep.<br> We can find it, or<br> we don't have a big win.<br> Can I take a brief<br> break here for a moment?<br> I'll be right back.<br> -You told me you weren't feeling great.<br> -Bullshit!<br> If I was on my deathbed, if it<br> helped you, you'd drag me out of it!<br> How could you take this away from me?<br> -Nobody's taking anything.<br> -Bullshit! You stuck me in Siberia!<br> Dictating to some goddamned clerk<br> so you could finish this without me.<br> They screwed up, Erin!<br> They screwed up and they admit it.<br> The arbitration proposal...<br> ...could've been written in Sanskrit,<br> for all the sense it made.<br> I know. I spoke to Ted. Pamela Duncan<br> wouldn't even get on the phone with me!<br> Pamela made everybody<br> mad with that letter.<br> She called us thieves.<br> -The whole thing's falling apart.<br> -Why?<br> Because before we go to arbitration,<br> the plaintiffs must agree!<br> -How many?<br> -Usually they require about 70% .<br> PG&E is demanding 90.<br> In other words, everybody.<br> Do you understand? This is serious.<br> And, what, Ed? I'm not serious?<br> You're emotional, you're erratic.<br> You say anything, you make<br> this personal, and it isn't.<br> Not personal?<br> That is my work!<br> My sweat! My time away from my kids!<br> If that's not personal,<br> I don't know what is.<br> Hey, come on.<br> Come on.<br> Go home. Get well.<br> Because you're no good to me sick.<br> I need you, all right?<br> This case needs you.<br> Did you tell them that?<br> Binding arbitration isn't<br> that different from a trial.<br> It's overseen by a judge. Evidence<br> is presented in much the same way.<br> And then a jury decides?<br> Sorry, I forgot to mention that<br> there's no jury in binding arbitration.<br> No jury and no appeal.<br> What option do we have if<br> we don't like the result?<br> None. The judge's decision is final.<br> Not a good answer.<br> No, but we don't<br> anticipate that being a problem.<br> As I already told you...<br> ...it's definitely between<br> Well, which?<br> There's a big difference.<br> I wouldn't like to speculate.<br> -Well, how does it get divided?<br> -Yeah, who gets what?<br> My medical bills started two years ago,<br> before some of the other people here.<br> My daughter was in and out<br> of hospitals more than his.<br> It shouldn't matter when it started.<br> People, listen, please!<br> The point we have to address<br> tonight is getting everyone to agree...<br> ...that binding arbitration<br> is better than a trial...<br> ...that could go on for<br> Maybe some of us<br> wanna wait 1 0 years!<br> Everyone has to agree,<br> or no one has a chance!<br> Those of you about to leave, I'd like<br> you to keep this date in mind: 1 978!<br> That's the year of<br> the Love Canal controversy.<br> They're still<br> waiting for their money!<br> Think about where<br> you'll be in 1 5 or 20 years.<br> Now, look, everyone.<br> Is this a big decision?<br> Absolutely! But I do not<br> believe this is a sell-out.<br> This is the best shot<br> to get everyone some money now.<br> You and I both know...<br> ...there are people in this<br> room who can't afford to wait.<br> To take that chance.<br> Are you gonna make them wait?<br> So how many altogether?<br> We got just about everybody that came<br> here, but it leaves us about 1 50 short.<br> Oh, shit.<br> We'll have to go door-to-door.<br> I gotta go pick up my kids.<br> -You need a hand with that?<br> -No.<br> You did good.<br> We'll see.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Don't take them anywhere on your<br> bike. I'll give you money for a cab.<br> I got money.<br> So how long is this gonna take?<br> I don't know. A few days.<br> Got your own room.<br> I am really sorry, George.<br> Have the kids eaten?<br> No.<br> Wanna get some pancakes?<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Everybody up today.<br> All right.<br> Come on, baby.<br> -What time is it?<br> -It's early.<br> We're taking your<br> car to go get breakfast.<br> -No, I need my car.<br> -We'll be back in a minute.<br> Get some sleep.<br> Matt, buddy.<br> Put that down. Let's go.<br> I'll be there in a minute.<br> Let's go get some<br> pancakes, girly. Come on.<br> Don't play with that.<br> It took me so long to get organized.<br> Would you put that back, please?<br> This girl's the same age as me.<br> Is she sick?<br> She is, but that's<br> why I'm helping her.<br> We'll make her feel better.<br> Why can't her own mama help her?<br> Because she's real sick too.<br> I'll bring you back some breakfast.<br> You want eggs?<br> Eggs would be great.<br> Eggs would be perfect.<br> -Hey, Matt.<br> -Hey, Erin. How are you?<br> -You been at this all day?<br> -Yeah.<br> -You want some coffee?<br> -I'd love some.<br> -I'll make a fresh pot.<br> -Thanks.<br> Don't I know you?<br> I don't think so.<br> Sure, you were at the barbecue<br> in Hinkley.<br> And at the town meeting.<br> I was watching you.<br> I had my eye on you.<br> Nice.<br> You were talking to everybody<br> and writing down a lot of stuff.<br> When I saw you, I said to myself,<br> "There's something about her.<br> I really like that girl."<br> -Matt, can I get that coffee to go?<br> -Sure thing.<br> I feel like I can talk to you too.<br> Like you're the type of person<br> I could say anything to.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Great.<br> What do I owe you?<br> -There's no charge.<br> -Thanks, Matt.<br> Well, nice talking to you.<br> Would it be important if, when I worked<br> at the plant, I destroyed documents?<br> Maybe.<br> What's your name?<br> Charles Embry.<br> Charles. Erin.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> Can you excuse me for a quick--<br> I'm just gonna run to the....<br> Oh, come on.<br> Oh, you fucking piece of crap<br> with no signal!<br> Fuck!<br> Ed. Ed, oh, my God.<br> This guy said he destroyed records.<br> He worked there.<br> Slow down.<br> I'm trying to relax.<br> This Charles Embry--<br> -Who?<br> -Charles Embry.<br> I thought he was trying to kill me<br> or pick me up...<br> ...but why would he use that,<br> say that? It's crazy.<br> Shit. Go back and see if he'll<br> make a declaration.<br> A declaration.<br> But be careful.<br> Don't scare him off.<br> And stay calm. Stay calm.<br> If it weren't for you,<br> I'd be in Palm Springs now.<br> You're good at talking people<br> into things.<br> Don't pepper him with questions.<br> Don't do that. Just--<br> People wanna tell their story.<br> Just let him talk. Let him...<br> ... do all the talking. All right?<br> Oh, sorry.<br> Would you like another beer, or....<br> My cousin passed away yesterday.<br> He had kidney tumours...<br> ...no colon, his intestines<br> were eaten away.<br> Forty-one years old.<br> I remember seeing him<br> over at the plant.<br> He'd be cleaning<br> the cooling towers, wearing....<br> What do you call them?<br> -A mask?<br> -Yeah, doctors' masks.<br> And it'd be soaked in red<br> from the nosebleeds.<br> I was working in the compressor.<br> The supervisor calls me<br> up to the office and says:<br> "We'll give you a shredder...<br> ...and send you to the warehouse<br> to shred the documents we stored."<br> He say why?<br> Nope. And I didn't ask.<br> Did you look at the stuff<br> you destroyed?<br> It was a lot of dull<br> vacation schedules and stuff.<br> Then there were memos about<br> the holding ponds, the water in them.<br> And readings from the test wells,<br> stuff like that.<br> You were told to destroy those?<br> That's right.<br> Course, as it turns out...<br> ...l wasn't a very good employee.<br> -Good morning!<br> -Morning.<br> Ed. Erin, what's this?<br> -May l?<br> -Yep. Go ahead.<br> Well, you know what, Mr. Potter?<br> We completely forgot<br> your birthday this year.<br> Seeing as how you've been so good<br> to me, it's a terrible oversight.<br> So Ed and I have been putting together<br> a present for you.<br> Six-hundred and thirty-four.<br> They're signed, every one.<br> Holy shit.<br> Now, don't go<br> getting jealous, Theresa.<br> We have something for you.<br> Internal PG&E documents,<br> all about the contamination.<br> The one I like best says...<br> ...l'm paraphrasing here, but it says,<br> "The water's poisonous...<br> ...but it's best if this wasn't<br> discussed with the neighbours."<br> It's to Hinkley<br> from PG&E headquarters.<br> Stamp received March 1 966.<br> How did you do this?<br> Seeing as how I have no<br> brains or legal expertise...<br> ...and Ed was losing all faith.<br> Completely. No faith.<br> I went out there and performed sexual<br> favours. 634 blowjobs in five days.<br> I'm really quite tired.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Why did you want me to come?<br> I wanna show you<br> what you helped to do.<br> -How are you feeling today?<br> -Good.<br> -It's a good day.<br> -Oh, I'm glad.<br> Well, come on in.<br> What a nice surprise this is.<br> Donna.<br> I wanted to come out here<br> instead of calling...<br> ...because the judge<br> came back with a number.<br> For the whole group, or for us?<br> Both.<br> He's gonna make them pay 333 million.<br> -And....<br> -Oh, my God.<br> He's gonna make them give<br> Five million dollars?<br> Five million dollars.<br> I don't even know<br> how much money that is.<br> Well, it's enough. It's enough<br> for whatever you could ever need...<br> ...or what your girls need, or your<br> girls' girls. It'll be enough.<br> Oh, Erin. Oh, God.<br> Thank you so much.<br> It's okay.<br> I don't know what I'd have done<br> without you.<br> It's a good day.<br> This is too much.<br> Masry and Vititoe, can l--?<br> Shoot!<br> Delivery for Ed Masry.<br> Last office down the corridor,<br> on the right.<br> Thank you.<br> Masry and Vititoe--<br> Damn it!<br> Does anyone know anything<br> about these phones?<br> Everybody loves the desk...<br> ...you picked out for me.<br> It's great.<br> Guess who's on the cover<br> of Los Angeles Lawyer magazine?<br> Talk to you later, baby. Bye.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You're welcome.<br> I'd rather walk her through this<br> in person, to show her...<br> ...visual aids, documents and stuff.<br> Tell her I won't take up<br> too much of her time.<br> It's a little more complicated<br> than Hinkley, so let me do that.<br> Say I'm not a lawyer.<br> That may help.<br> Great.<br> Why don't you give me the address now?<br> Just in case.<br> All right. Thanks so much. Bye.<br> What's up?<br> I have your bonus check.<br> I want you to be prepared.<br> The figure's not exactly<br> what we discussed.<br> Why not?<br> Because, after careful consideration,<br> I felt...<br> ...that figure was not appropriate.<br> Although you may not agree...<br> ...you have to trust my--<br> Trust? You want me to trust you?<br> Don't use big words<br> you don't understand.<br> -It's a complicated issue--<br> -I did a job.<br> You should reward me accordingly.<br> It's not complicated.<br> All you lawyers do is complicate<br> situations that aren't complicated.<br> Do you know why people think<br> lawyers are scumbags?<br> Because they are. I can't believe<br> you're doing this to me...<br> ...when I'm up to my ass<br> in Kettleman plaintiffs...<br> ...which looks to be<br> double the amount of Hinkley.<br> You expect me to leave my kids<br> with strangers, knock on doors...<br> ...get these people to trust you,<br> and you're screwing me!<br> I want you to know,<br> it's not about the number!<br> It is about the way<br> my work is valued.<br> No matter what I do, you're not--<br> As I was saying...<br> ...l decided that the figure<br> you proposed...<br> ...was inappropriate.<br> So I increased it.<br> Do they teach beauty queens<br> how to apologize?<br> Because you suck at it.<br>
