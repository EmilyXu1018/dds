                        And here we are,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> in 1900,<br> standing on the very spot<br> where Desdemona first met<br> Othello many centuries ago.<br> Venice-<br> Queen of the Adriatic.<br> Venice- the city of silence.<br> That cannon,<br> ladies and gentlemen,<br> is fired off every day to<br> indicate the noon hour.<br> Every day in Venice at noon,<br> you hear, boom.<br> In Venice,<br> there are 177 canals<br> measuring 28 miles,<br> and there are 156 bridges<br> connecting 114 islands.<br> And there is the great<br> Church of St. Mark.<br> The Church of St. Mark<br> was begun in 830,<br> but was not finished<br> until the 15th century.<br> There are<br> more than 500 marble columns<br> in the Church of St. Mark.<br> The mosaic work covers an<br> area of 45,970 square feet,<br> and the interior is completely<br> produced and decorated...<br> Are you finished,<br> Caryl?<br> Yes. Until 7:00.<br> You're a darling<br> to have waited so long.<br> I didn't mind.<br> You know, you must be<br> made of strawberry ices.<br> Oh... did you ask Ilanti for<br> an increase in salary?<br> Yes. And he said no.<br> Then you shouldn't<br> be working here.<br> Darling, you're a genius.<br> Oh, please don't say that,<br> Fenella. I'm not a genius.<br> If you persist<br> in thinking I am,<br> you're going to be<br> terribly disappointed.<br> Photographs of the big fair<br> and party, friends,<br> celebrating the opening<br> of the 20th century.<br> Photograph?<br> No, thank you.<br> I've got an idea.<br> Why don't you give a concert<br> of your own in a hall?<br> That's what I want to do,<br> but that takes money.<br> Don't you know some rich<br> person who'd sponsor you?<br> Even if I did, he mightn't<br> consider me a good investment.<br> Oh, silly, you'd be a wonderful investment.<br> Caryl Dubrok-<br> The son of the great composer<br> - Alfred Dubrok.<br> Why, any sensible sponsor<br> would jump at the chance.<br> Grazie mille.<br> I know.<br> Professor Heinrich.<br> Professor Heinrich?<br> Of course. Why didn't<br> we think of him before?<br> Professor Heinrich is<br> not only your friend.<br> he was your<br> father's as well.<br> I'll ask him to arrange<br> a concert for you.<br> He's at home now.<br> No, I'm sure he wouldn't<br> consider me talented enough to bother with.<br> He'd be embarrassed,<br> and so would I.<br> Very well. If you<br> want to be stubborn.<br> I'm not stubborn.<br> It's simply a case of-<br> Then there's only one<br> thing left for us to do,<br> and that is<br> to get married.<br> Married?<br> Of course. Papa and<br> Mama know we're in love.<br> And our marriage would solve everything.<br> How?<br> Don't be silly.<br> The Maclean money<br> And the Dubrok genius.<br> No. No, Fenella.<br> Caryl...<br> What, darling?<br> Don't you want us<br> to be married?<br> You know I do, Fenella. More<br> than anything in the world.<br> That's why I'm saving my money.<br> In a year's time, I'll have saved<br> enough to give a concert in Milan.<br> Then if I'm a success, we-<br> Look here, though, I shan't be able to save<br> anything if we always ride in gondolas.<br> I mean, wouldn't we get to your<br> house sooner if we walked?<br> The canal is so roundabout.<br> I don't want to get home<br> sooner, as you put it.<br> This is Wednesday, you know.<br> Wednesday?<br> Yes. That's why I don't<br> want to go home early.<br> I don't understand.<br> Well, I, Fenella Maclean,<br> am at present residing<br> in the Neroni Palace<br> in Venice,<br> which is a famous<br> city of Italy.<br> All of Venice is famous,<br> and the Neroni Palace<br> is especially famous.<br> It's very old and smelly.<br> It contains on the lower floor<br> priceless paintings<br> and frescoes.<br> The Macleans occupy<br> quarters on the second floor.<br> And on Wednesdays,<br> The public is admitted to the<br> art treasures of the palace.<br> Little barbarians.<br> Giggling females.<br> Good afternoon,<br> Herr Heinrich.<br> Good afternoon.<br> My dear.<br> This schoolgirl visitation<br> gets worse every week.<br> The place is fairly swarming<br> with the little wretches.<br> But it does give the<br> palace a certain atmosphere.<br> You must admit that, Ivor.<br> I don't want atmosphere. I want peace.<br> Here, darling.<br> Drink your tea.<br> And your rehearsals,<br> Herr Heinrich,<br> are they going well?<br> Rather well, yes.<br> But I miss my own orchestra.<br> It will be a relief<br> to get back to London.<br> Let me go. Let go.<br> Let me go.<br> Let me go, or I'll crack<br> your shins for you.<br> Let me go.<br> Giuseppe, who is that young person?<br> It's a thief, Signor Maclean.<br> We found her in the<br> Signorina's bedroom.<br> A thief, huh?<br> Bring her in.<br> Let me alone.<br> Let me alone.<br> Giuseppe, you may wait outside.<br> Oh, stop her. She'll<br> jump in the canal.<br> Yes, I will if you don't<br> let me alone, you ninnies.<br> Why all the fuss?<br> I'm no thief.<br> Then what were you<br> doing in my daughter's room?<br> Oh. Was it your daughter's?<br> She has a lot of<br> clothes, hasn't she?<br> Well?<br> I was hiding.<br> Hiding? From whom?<br> The schoolgirls.<br> Then the teachers began to call roll,<br> and I had to skip.<br> You see, I'm not a schoolgirl.<br> But why did you<br> join them at all?<br> To get something to eat.<br> To eat?<br> Yes. You see, it's this way.<br> These school groups visit<br> the museums and stuffy<br> old places like this.<br> Then afterward, they<br> go to a shop for tea,<br> and I go along<br> and eat with them<br> if they<br> don't find me out first.<br> It's a good arrangement.<br> It works out<br> very well, generally.<br> But you mean you've done<br> this sort of thing before?<br> I do it all the time.<br> But that's stealing.<br> Aha. Someone has been<br> cheating at solitaire.<br> There's a red 8 on a red 9.<br> Cheating a bit<br> at solitaire is<br> quite different from stealing, my girl.<br> Yes, it is. You have<br> no need to cheat at cards.<br> But sometimes,<br> I do have to steal food.<br> Oh, hello.<br> So your present costume<br> was merely put on<br> for the occasion, right?<br> You are a clever old<br> verwandte,aren't you?<br> What does she mean<br> - verwandte?<br> It's difficult to translate,<br> fortunately.<br> Young woman, I shall call the police<br> unless you confine yourself to English<br> and sensible English at that.<br> If you call the police,<br> I shall tell them<br> you cheat at solitaire.<br> Now, then, what is your name?<br> Gemma.<br> Gemma what?<br> Gemma Smith.<br> You don't like Smith? Then<br> my name is Gemma Porloniovsky.<br> However, it's really Smith.<br> But you're English.<br> I was born of an English<br> father and a Hungarian mother<br> on a Dutch ship on the high seas.<br> But as soon as<br> we made port, they put my father in prison.<br> For fathering you?<br> No. For killing a man.<br> What?<br> Yes.<br> And later on, my mother<br> committed suicide.<br> And- and then?<br> Oh... nothing much. Grew up with<br> relatives of my mother.<br> Decided I didn't care<br> for them and ran away.<br> But how did you get to Venice?<br> On a wine cart from Padua.<br> But the driver wasn't a nice man.<br> And as soon as we came<br> to the edge of the city,<br> he kicked me off.<br> And in Venice, what did you do?<br> I went to a hospital,<br> a free one.<br> Oh, were you ill?<br> No. No, I felt fine.<br> But I was having a baby.<br> Perhaps you would like<br> me to tell you about it.<br> Thank you. We shan't go into that.<br> Oh, but the baby is wonderful.<br> I call him Piccolo<br> because he is so little.<br> This, uh, child, did it<br> have a father?<br> What do you think?<br> Certainly, it did.<br> The father was my husband...<br> for a while.<br> He is dead now.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Yes.<br> Well, that's about all.<br> Venice... my baby,<br> me discharged from the hospital<br> with no strength in my bones<br> and no money in my stocking.<br> But it all came out all right.<br> I'm like a cat.<br> I always land on my feet.<br> You know, inside of a day,<br> I'd fainted in the street,<br> and there my friend found me.<br> The baby and I are staying<br> with him for a moment.<br> And this friend<br> of yours, is he-<br> Oh, no.<br> He has no money either.<br> That's why I go about with the schools<br> - to get food for us.<br> This so-called<br> friend, who is he?<br> Young musician.<br> His name is Dubrok.<br> Oh!<br> Yes, he's the son of Albert Dubrok<br> - the composer.<br> A famous father, but the son,<br> weren't a much smaller bush<br> if you ask me. However he might-<br> You may go.<br> You mean it?<br> I do, indeed.<br> Please go at once.<br> Oh, all right.<br> Arrivederci.<br> Thank heavens<br> Fenella wasn't here.<br> By the way, where is she?<br> She... she's out with Mr. Dubrok.<br> Hello, everybody.<br> I have news for you.<br> Oh, I'm so glad you're here,<br> Professor Heinrich.<br> Darling.<br> Mama, papa.<br> Fenella, listen to me.<br> No. You listen to me, Papa.<br> I have a wonderful<br> surprise, and it won't keep.<br> I'm going to marry Caryl Dubrok.<br> Great scott. What did you say?<br> She said she's going<br> to marry Caryl Dubrok.<br> No, darling.<br> You couldn't possibly.<br> The fellow's a scoundrel.<br> We're leaving Venice at once.<br> It's just as well.<br> One can't trust it.<br> You know, the whole idea of fetching<br> a train in a boat is ridiculous.<br> I can't get used to it.<br> How are you?<br> Fenella, I...<br> What's happening? Are<br> your parents going away?<br> Yes. And I'm going with them.<br> You're what?<br> Fenella, come along.<br> I can't marry you, Caryl.<br> But why not?<br> Because of Gemma.<br> Gemma? Gemma?<br> But who is Gemma?<br> Ask Professor Heinrich.<br> Fenella, please wait a moment.<br> Really, I don't know any Gemma.<br> I've never even heard of such a person.<br> You've got to believe me.<br> Fenella...<br> Look, Professor, I don't know any Gemma.<br> I've never even heard of such a person.<br> You've got to believe me.<br> I do.<br> The trouble is<br> the Macleans prefer<br> to believe Gemma.<br> That's why they are taking<br> their daughter out<br> to the Dolomites.<br> The parents would have<br> objected to you in any case.<br> They don't like musicians.<br> Musicians are not practical.<br> They don't make money.<br> Fenella doesn't care<br> about money.<br> Rich people<br> are always saying that,<br> but they don't<br> really mean it.<br> Which way, Signore?<br> Diritto.<br> Diritto? Bene.<br> Listen.<br> Oh, it's an original tune<br> and rather diverting.<br> Why, that's one of<br> my father's things,<br> and that<br> concertina's mine.<br> It is your concertina?<br> Yes. I loaned it to<br> Sebastian in Milan last year.<br> Don't you see?<br> That must be<br> my brother Sebastian<br> playing the concertina up there.<br> Gondolier, stop.<br> The music's coming<br> from that upper window,<br> the one with the white rags<br> hanging out over the ledge.<br> Your so-called white rags are<br> baby napkins, my young friend.<br> What do you mean?<br> They're Gemma's.<br> Gemma, huh?<br> Piccolo, there is positively<br> no boy soprano part<br> in this composition,<br> so shut up!<br> Thank you.<br> I knew it.<br> Oh, hello.<br> Look here, Sebastian-<br> I'm glad you dropped in.<br> There's something<br> I want you to hear.<br> I've got something<br> I want you to hear.<br> Listen.<br> You've upset my applecart<br> again, haven't you?<br> Have I? It must be<br> a very poorly balanced<br> applecart to upset so easily.<br> Besides, how could I?<br> I haven't seen you since Milan.<br> Do you know a girl named Gemma?<br> Also, her brat.<br> He's a cute little<br> fella, isn't he?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Oh, no, thanks.<br> I create music.<br> It's Gemma's.<br> Would you be so kind as<br> to explain who Gemma is?<br> Certainly. I found her wandering around<br> in the streets one day,<br> sort of starving<br> and so on, you know,<br> so I thought the only humane thing to do<br> was to take her in, so I did.<br> Very noble of you.<br> It certainly was,<br> considering the state of my finances.<br> Uh, by the way-<br> Not a lira.<br> Loaning you money is like<br> feeding straws to a fire.<br> What's that<br> you're whistling?<br> This little<br> song I'm writing.<br> Gemma has got<br> a pretty nice voice.<br> I thought she might sing it some day.<br> Here. Take a look.<br> "Escape Me Never. "<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Words by Browning,<br> With slight additions<br> by Sebastian Dubrok.<br> Escape me never<br> My beloved-<br> While I am I<br> And you are you.<br> Of course, I'm not letting Gemma know<br> she's got voice enough to sing it.<br> You know how women are.<br> Once they begin to think they're<br> important, they get absolutely out of hand.<br> From what I've heard of Gemma,<br> she's already out of hand.<br> Why? Do you know her?<br> No. But she<br> forced her way<br> into the Neroni<br> Palace yesterday,<br> and the palace happens to be<br> in the residence of<br> some friends of mine-<br> Mr. And Mrs. Maclean<br> and Miss Maclean.<br> And your precious<br> Gemma told them<br> she was living with a<br> musician named Dubrok,<br> so naturally, they<br> assumed it was me.<br> They- they thought I-<br> Oh, shut up.<br> Oh, that's very funny.<br> Hey, Gemma.<br> Signore.<br> Is your name Gemma?<br> If it is, you've put on<br> a bit of weight.<br> Gemma.<br> Yeah?<br> Huh?<br> Come on up.<br> Something's happened.<br> Come on up quick.<br> I'll be there in a minute.<br> All right, everybody to the fountain.<br> I'm in a hurry.<br> Come on.<br> You must go now, Signorina.<br> Maybe someday, you will not have to go.<br> That would be nice.<br> All of us here feel the same way.<br> I know I'm older than you, and I'm fat,<br> but perhaps there's other things.<br> If you were my wife,<br> you will have all the<br> bread you want to eat<br> and love and 5 little ones.<br> You think 5 too many?<br> Ah, but everyone must have<br> at least 5, to be happy.<br> You marry me,<br> and you get 5 all at<br> once without no trouble.<br> Signorina, if you could-<br> Dino, can we talk<br> about it later, huh?<br> Antonino.<br> Up.<br> Ah, thank you, Antonino.<br> Thank you.<br> Piccolo.<br> Don't worry.<br> He's all right.<br> Nothing wrong with him.<br> Gemma, hey.<br> Behold my brother<br> - Caryl.<br> The fool of the family, huh?<br> But he's in trouble.<br> You remember that palazzo<br> you went barging into yesterday?<br> Mm-hmm. What about it?<br> The family are friends of Caryl's<br> Ahem, especially the daughter.<br> You have no right<br> to laugh at Fenella.<br> You've never even seen her.<br> Nevertheless, I know<br> exactly what she's like.<br> She's the kind that is<br> always taking cold baths.<br> And she's frightfully<br> keen on croquet, you know,<br> and the only perfume she<br> ever uses is cologne water.<br> Why don't you be quiet?<br> But she has nice gloves<br> - just my size.<br> You stole those gloves<br> from Fenella.<br> Of course.<br> And what if I did?<br> Give them to me.<br> No. You try and get them.<br> Sebastian.<br> No.<br> You know... I like you.<br> Well, I don't like you.<br> How Sebastian can stand<br> having you around<br> I can't, for the life of me, see.<br> I am going.<br> Wait. Is she really<br> your sweetheart?<br> She was until<br> you spoiled it.<br> Aw.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I had no idea you were<br> more than friends with her.<br> I shouldn't have laughed<br> a moment ago.<br> Why don't you just go to this Fenella<br> and knock some sense into her?<br> Being a woman, she'll<br> love you all the more.<br> She's gone.<br> Left Venice, you mean?<br> Yes.<br> Where did she go?<br> To the Dolomites<br> What will you do?<br> I'm going to find her and tell<br> her about you and Sebastian.<br> Bravo. That's the stuff.<br> And I'll go with you.<br> Oh, no, you won't.<br> You better not go alone. I know women.<br> She'll never believe<br> you. You need a witness.<br> The Dolomites, yes.<br> We'll take my concertina<br> and set out immediately.<br> We'll cross valleys, climb mountains,<br> sing for our supper<br> in every swank hotel until you find her.<br> What do you say?<br> But it's not the way to<br> do it. It's not dignified.<br> Digni...<br> Oh... if she had wanted<br> someone dignified,<br> she could have had<br> her pick of them at home.<br> But, no,<br> she took you because you<br> are the opposite sort of person<br> her parents<br> would have chosen for her.<br> Besides, think how pleased she'll<br> be to have you come after her.<br> That's what a woman<br> really wants-<br> to be needed, pursued,<br> made to feel that she's-<br> Oh, what do you know about it?<br> I need a holiday,<br> and the Dolomites are just the place for it.<br> Stop grumbling. It's all settled.<br> Very well. Come along if you've<br> got the money for your train fare.<br> Train fare? What do<br> we need train fare for?<br> We're going a piedi, on<br> foot, shanks' mare.<br> What's the matter with<br> you? Can't you walk?<br> Are you a cripple?<br> All right.<br> Good.<br> Yes, it'll be wonderful.<br> We'll eat wild<br> strawberries with our lunch<br> and sit under the pine<br> trees when we are tired<br> and pick edelweiss<br> and alpenrosen.<br> But you're not coming.<br> Well, what I mean is<br> somebody's got to stay here<br> and take care of Piccolo.<br> After all,<br> this jaunt of ours might be<br> nothing but, well,<br> a wild goose chase.<br> You can't haul<br> a little baby.<br> Don't you think?<br> Caryl, what time is it?<br> Oh, that's the watch father<br> gave you, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Gold, too, eh?<br> Oh, no, you don't.<br> It's the last valuable<br> thing I own, and I won't part with it.<br> What? Do you mean to tell me<br> that you'd allow a miserable gold watch<br> to stand between you and Fenella?<br> Come on, we're going to need<br> a little dinero, aren't we?<br> I'll pawn it first thing in the morning,<br> and in return,<br> I shall bring you together with Fenella.<br> You shall be wed and go to live<br> in a little green-shuttered house.<br> Of course, there's a hitch.<br> You'll have to make<br> a living for her.<br> I'll expect to.<br> Don't worry. She'll expect you to.<br> Every morning you<br> leave the little house,<br> you'll have an attach case<br> full of contracts and music,<br> and Fenella will be upstairs<br> waving good-bye to you.<br> And then after you<br> have children-<br> Oh, stow it. How do you know<br> so much about my future?<br> Because I know your past.<br> But it'll be a pretty good life for you.<br> Why wouldn't it be a<br> good one for you, as well?<br> My dear, Gemma, Caryl is<br> the nice, dependable sort,<br> solid from tip to toe.<br> I only wish I were like him.<br> I'll bet you do.<br> But I never shall be.<br> I'm what the lady poets<br> call a free spirit.<br> Meaning a selfish pig-<br> about everything but your music.<br> Uh-huh. Ah, but honest about it.<br> Don't you think?<br> Funny little codger, isn't she?<br> Good-bye, Gemma.<br> My little Piccolo,<br> My pupazzetto,<br> I still have you, haven't I?<br> For a while, I have.<br> But in a few years,<br> you'll grow up to be<br> a big strong handsome man,<br> who makes some woman very unhappy.<br> Oh, so sweet.<br> You'll make her<br> happy at first, no doubt,<br> but in the end,<br> it'll be the same story.<br> Yes, it will.<br> Oh, it's all right, yes.<br> It's all right, Piccolo.<br> Yes, it's all right, my Piccolo.<br> I thought Piccolo would have<br> a feather to wake up with.<br> He gets a lot of fun out of it.<br> I suppose you don't<br> like being left behind.<br> I don't mind at all.<br> You shouldn't.<br> You'll be all right here, won't you?<br> Perfectly.<br> But Dino has asked me<br> to marry him.<br> I think I'll do it.<br> You'll what?<br> Marry Dino.<br> In the name of Piccolo?<br> What for?<br> Well, it would be a<br> very good arrangement.<br> I could take care<br> of his children,<br> and he could take care<br> of Piccolo and me.<br> Why, that's absolutely nonsense.<br> I never heard anything so ridiculous.<br> You ought to be pleased<br> to get rid of me.<br> Maybe I should, at that.<br> Very well.<br> Then there's nothing<br> further to discuss.<br> You'll go your way,<br> and I'll go mine.<br> And we shall both be free<br> as we were before...<br> and Dino will be kind to me,<br> much kinder than<br> you've ever been.<br> So, he's been kind<br> to you, has he?<br> Why, that fat bread peddler.<br> I suppose the next thing<br> you'll be telling me,<br> He calls you his coricino.<br> I can hear him now.<br> "Ah, signorina,<br> I love you. "<br> Shut your mouth.<br> I don't understand<br> your wretched Italian.<br> You don't? Then<br> I'll translate it.<br> "Without you,<br> my love...<br> without you on my arm, I cannot live. "<br> But enough.<br> Come to think of it...<br> you don't sing as much through<br> your nose as you used to.<br> You might be useful.<br> Caryl can play the concertina,<br> and you and I<br> can do the singing.<br> But what would I do with Piccolo?<br> Piccolo? Put him in an orphanage.<br> He's not an orphan.<br> Well, all right.<br> I can live with it.<br> Take him along.<br> The mountain air would be good for him.<br> Good for you, too.<br> Wouldn't it?<br> All right.<br> Then it's settled.<br> Dino.<br> Piccolo, Piccolo,<br> We are going with him, yes.<br> Behold- the Dolomites-<br> a region named<br> for the famous french geologist Dolomieu<br> because it was he<br> who made them known to the world.<br> I wish he'd made them less steep.<br> How much farther is it to Orzano?<br> Oh, about a kilometer.<br> Orzano tonight.<br> Tomorrow night, Martino.<br> She may have left Martino.<br> Heinrich's letter said they'd<br> be there until Wednesday.<br> They might have changed<br> their plans.<br> Oh... here. You carry Piccolo<br> for a while.<br> That'll give you<br> something to worry about.<br> Great scott, Piccolo. You're<br> getting heavier every day.<br> Naturally.<br> Look, Sebastian, edelweiss.<br> Isn't it beautiful?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> She loves me.<br> She loves me not.<br> No, don't. You'll ruin it.<br> Oh, come on.<br> You're wasting time.<br> We're not wasting time.<br> We're enjoying ourselves.<br> Don't tease him. He's<br> unhappy without his Fenella.<br> Just because he's unhappy,<br> he wants everybody else to be unhappy.<br> Come along, Monsieur le Duc.<br> We have to find Caryl's lady love.<br> Then he won't be so cross.<br> Come on.<br> Come, follow,<br> follow, follow<br> Follow,<br> follow<br> Follow me...<br> Come, follow,<br> follow, follow<br> Follow, follow,<br> follow me...<br> Come, follow,<br> follow, follow<br> Come, follow,<br> follow me...<br> Come, follow,<br> follow, follow<br> Follow,<br> follow<br> Follow me...<br> Come, follow,<br> follow, follow<br> Follow, follow,<br> follow me<br> Oh, Sebastian, I think<br> we had better find another way.<br> Why? Afraid of getting<br> your feet wet? Go on.<br> Wait until I take my shoes off.<br> Oh!<br> You know, I think it might be deep.<br> Well, you go first,<br> then if you sink,<br> we'll know it is.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Come on, Monsieur le Duc.<br> Shove, Caryl.<br> Pull.<br> Piccolo, Piccolo!<br> What are you trying to do,<br> drown my baby?<br> Piccolo. Aw, Piccolo.<br> Oh.<br> I'm sorry, Caryl.<br> Does it hurt very much?<br> I can walk.<br> It can't be very far now.<br> Gre, fraulein.<br> Gr gott.<br> I wonder if you could tell us,<br> how far is it<br> to Orzano, please?<br> Just a few kilometers.<br> You'll see it around the turn.<br> Uh-huh. And what about<br> lodgings- cheap ones?<br> Oh, there's an inn there that's<br> very cheap and also very good.<br> Just this side of the hotel.<br> Zumkefeldzen, it's called.<br> Well, that's very kind of you, indeed.<br> And may I say<br> that if all the natives of the<br> Dolomites are as charming as you,<br> our travels will be<br> most pleasant?<br> Oh, for heaven's sake,<br> Sebastian.<br> Auf wiedersehen.<br> There it is-<br> big as life and twice as wonderful.<br> Caryl, take this to the landlady<br> and ask her to fill<br> it with warm milk, huh?<br> All right.<br> Oh, don't take that off, Sebastian.<br> It's his good luck charm.<br> This?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Hey, be careful.<br> That's valuable.<br> Valuable?<br> Yes.<br> It's a composition-<br> my father's,<br> signed by his own hand. Look.<br> Boy, I could sell this<br> for a barrelful of money.<br> Then why don't you.<br> I'm keeping it for<br> something to shoot at.<br> Ah, he was a master of melody<br> - the old man.<br> You do better than that.<br> Hmm?<br> You're a master of everything,<br> but nothing ever masters you.<br> Miss- uh, madam, I think<br> it's just warm enough.<br> Danke schn,<br> frau Huber.<br> I'll take care of your knee<br> in a moment, Caryl.<br> Piccolo, look.<br> Hmm...<br> pretty good...<br> for the price.<br> Sebastian, better<br> get over to the hotel<br> and see if they'll<br> let us sing tonight, huh?<br> All right.<br> Wait until I make myself seductive.<br> Hmm, you must expect the<br> manager to be a woman.<br> No, but he'll probably have a wife.<br> See if the hotel orchestra<br> will help us out.<br> It'll make a better concert.<br> That way, we can expect<br> a fee from the manager<br> on top of what we collect<br> from the guests.<br> Will you remember?<br> Mm-hmm. You know, you two<br> are lucky to have me along.<br> We've landed a concert engagement<br> every night since we left Venice.<br> Don't take all the credit for that.<br> You've had to use Gemma's baby<br> to clinch the deal more than once.<br> Well, how do I look?<br> Uh, like a duke in disguise.<br> What? Only a duke? Wow.<br> Oh, yes, you better<br> wear this tonight.<br> It's quite becoming. It<br> makes you look like a woman.<br> Well, arrivederci, children.<br> And don't forget to<br> keep the door locked.<br> There may be dragons in the forest.<br> Let's see.<br> Yes, it's a bad bruise,<br> all right.<br> Gemma.<br> You think this is going<br> to be too tight, huh?<br> Gemma.<br> You really are in love<br> with him, aren't you?<br> Ah.<br> He's a dreadful man.<br> That girl we met on the bike,<br> he could never expect<br> to see her again,<br> oh, but he had to spread<br> his charm on her<br> like jam on a piece of bread.<br> He does it all the time.<br> He's probably ogling some<br> woman at this very moment.<br> He just can't help it.<br> He's always been like that.<br> Now, you lie down and make<br> yourself comfortable.<br> I have to get Piccolo<br> ready for bed.<br> Women are nothing but<br> parsley to Sebastian.<br> Music, that's his meat.<br> I know.<br> That's the only thing<br> in this whole world<br> that he's really unselfish about.<br> It's a pity you don't<br> care more for music.<br> But I have the baby.<br> You know, Caryl, Piccolo<br> actually belongs to me.<br> He's my music<br> and much more wonderful than<br> anything Sebastian could ever write.<br> I still think it's a pity<br> you don't care more for his music.<br> What difference does it make?<br> Does a wife have to be-<br> I mean a woman-<br> mad about the profession<br> of the man she loves?<br> Is that necessary?<br> No. I suppose not.<br> I could take care of him-<br> cook for him, mend,<br> keep him well,<br> see that he worked when he should.<br> That's important, isn't it?<br> We could be happy together.<br> Except that it wouldn't be fair to you.<br> Sebastian's wife will have<br> a rather unpleasant<br> time of it, I imagine.<br> My dear Caryl, do<br> you expect love to be pleasant?<br> Has it been pleasant for you?<br> Is your Fenella perfect?<br> Practically. Yes.<br> Parsley. I don't even<br> mean that much to him.<br> But... ah, but surely-<br> No. It's not what you think, Caryl.<br> A pat on the head,<br> an occasional hug,<br> absent-minded kiss now and then.<br> That's all that's<br> ever been between us,<br> and it's not enough.<br> I want more than that.<br> I want my share of love.<br> I want him to be my husband.<br> Your brother's a beast.<br> He seems to think I have<br> no feelings whatsoever,<br> no blood in my veins,<br> no need to be happy like other women.<br> I hate him.<br> Caryl, I think you had better stay<br> home tonight with that knee.<br> Then you can take care<br> of the baby for me.<br> All right, if you and<br> Sebastian can manage without me.<br> Of course, we can.<br> Piccolo...<br> did you hear what he<br> said about my dress?<br> You know, he's never really<br> noticed my clothes before.<br> That's because I've never<br> had anything stylish,<br> and I wouldn't have had this time<br> if I hadn't bought the<br> stuff and made it myself.<br> And it'll look even<br> better in the moonlight,<br> because after the concert,<br> we'll walk home together,<br> and I'll take his arm,<br> and perhaps he'll<br> say more nice things,<br> but not about<br> my dress, about me.<br> Perhaps he'll even tell me<br> he's in love with me, huh?<br> We'll see you later.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> And now for your pleasure...<br> for your pleasure,<br> a song- "Love for Love. "<br> 'Promise me<br> Love for love<br> And I'm yours<br> Till the end of time<br> Love is a wondrous adventure<br> Something that<br> no one should miss<br> If you want me, darling<br> Take me<br> All that I ask is this<br> Give me love for love<br> Nothing more<br> Nothing less<br> Don't promise me the moon<br> Leave the stars<br> Where they are<br> Give me just your heart<br> Say it's mine<br> Only mine<br> Promise me<br> Love for love<br> And I'm yours<br> Till the end of time. '<br> Collect now.<br> What?<br> Collect now.<br> But we haven't given them a fair go.<br> Shouldn't we play<br> one or 2 more songs?<br> Go on.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> It was charming, monsieur.<br> Charming.<br> Indeed it was, madam. Charming.<br> Our pleasure, I assure you. Charming.<br> The manager's wife.<br> Of course.<br> Charming.<br> Your pleasure, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Madam, thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Not there.<br> The old geezer.<br> Oh, boy.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, thank you, sir.<br> Melvin.<br> Thank you. And you, madam, thank you.<br> Our pleasure.<br> Did you do well tonight?<br> Uh-huh. Pretty well.<br> Aha. You did all right yourself.<br> I don't just mean the money.<br> You were wonderful- singing.<br> Thank you.<br> You're happy tonight, huh?<br> Yes, I am. And do you know something?<br> What?<br> I didn't mind your<br> flirting with that woman.<br> Me? Flirting?<br> What woman?<br> The manager's wife.<br> Oh. The manager's wife.<br> We got to be nice to people like that.<br> After all, they're our bread and butter.<br> Yes, I know, but, Sebastian,<br> we wouldn't even have<br> to bother with them<br> if you'd settle down and write-<br> and I know you can-<br> really good music.<br> Gemma, darling,<br> to write really good music,<br> you've got to be... inspired.<br> Inspired?<br> Yes. By a place, by somebody.<br> Somebody?<br> Look, a falling star. Make a wish.<br> Aw. Too late.<br> Yes, it generally is too late.<br> But if you had seen it,<br> what would you have wished for?<br> Well, what would you<br> have wished for?<br> Me? Ooh, a nice<br> cold glass of beer.<br> How about you?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> A pair of new shoes<br> or a woolly for Piccolo.<br> Piccolo needs if a new woolly, buy one.<br> We can afford it.<br> Thanks, Sebastian.<br> And Caryl-<br> if he'd seen that falling star,<br> he would have wished<br> for the lovely Fenella.<br> Oh, that reminds me.<br> I must collect our fee from the<br> hotel manager in the morning.<br> Then we can go on to Martino.<br> Sebastian.<br> Hmm? Hmm?<br> Then we can go on to Martino.<br> Yes.<br> Did you really think my dress<br> looked attractive tonight?<br> Very...<br> very attractive.<br> Maledetto.<br> I forgot my concertina.<br> Well, is that important now?<br> Well, certainly, it's important.<br> Someone might pinch it.<br> I better go and get it.<br> Look, you go along<br> and I'll join you, hmm?<br> All right? Huh?<br> Go on.<br> Oh.<br> Good evening.<br> Please don't think me rude.<br> But I couldn't help noticing<br> you back there on the terrace.<br> I said to myself, I've seen<br> that face somewhere before.<br> Possibly Innsbruck. Was it?<br> I've never been<br> to Innsbruck. Sorry.<br> Oh. Monte Carlo, perhaps.<br> Don't you think this talk<br> of seeing me before is<br> a little old-fashioned?<br> Frankly, yes.<br> Well, would you be more willing to believe me<br> if I admit that I've never<br> seen your face before,<br> but once having seen it,<br> I had to see it again?<br> If I say yes, I'd be a bit<br> conceited, don't you think?<br> No.<br> Really, I must be going in now,<br> but thank you for the<br> charming compliment.<br> Oh, please don't go, not just yet.<br> I hate to repeat the obvious,<br> but... you are beautiful.<br> There's something so<br> cool and lovely about you.<br> You're like...<br> well, you're like edelweiss.<br> Yes, that belongs on you.<br> Will you wear it?<br> Satisfied?<br> Thank you.<br> You know, I think<br> every woman's a little bit<br> like a flower, don't you?<br> Some are like roses,<br> some, poppies.<br> but you-<br> you're like edelweiss,<br> preferring the mountaintops,<br> hard to reach.<br> That girl who sang, what of her?<br> Oh, you mean<br> my professional partner?<br> She's like a little buttercup.<br> You do have a way with words, don't you?<br> You think so? I think<br> I have a way with music.<br> You're a very talented<br> fellow, aren't you?<br> Oh, very. Tell me,<br> do you like music?<br> I adore it.<br> Oh?<br> Good music or just concertina?<br> Any kind that's really good-<br> symphony, opera. Why?<br> I do a bit of composing<br> now and then, that's all.<br> Really? How amazing.<br> Seeing you here at the hotel like this,<br> I should never have<br> taken you for a composer.<br> Well, even composers<br> have to eat.<br> Look at that.<br> Beautiful, isn't it?<br> Yes.<br> Tell me about your music.<br> What kind of music is it?<br> Would I have heard it?<br> I'm really interested.<br> Do you know what you look like,<br> standing there in the moonlight?<br> A picture I once saw in<br> Florence by Botticelli.<br> The Goddess of Spring-<br> in the Woods, I think.<br> I know the one you mean<br> - Primavera.<br> That's the one.<br> Primavera<br> - what a wonderful name for a ballet.<br> That's marvelous.<br> I can see the whole thing now-<br> the symbol of Spring.<br> You, you're<br> Primavera yourself.<br> I am?<br> Listen.<br> That's the theme.<br> Do you like it?<br> Oh, yes.<br> It must be terribly exciting<br> to do things like that-<br> be able to create<br> something out of the air.<br> I never could.<br> You don't need to.<br> Some people are born to inspire.<br> I really mean it.<br> I knew that it was no mere coincidence<br> that sent me to seek you out tonight.<br> Do you believe in destiny?<br> I don't know.<br> I never did until now.<br> I'd better get back<br> to the hotel.<br> No. Not until you tell me your name.<br> Primavera.<br> Very well, then.<br> Don't go yet, Primavera.<br> I should.<br> Please.<br> Well, all right.<br> But only for a few minutes.<br> Can you tell me where<br> the manager is, please?<br> His office is just upstairs, to the left.<br> Oh, Miss Maclean, if you please.<br> A letter for you...<br> Oh?<br> Perhaps the one<br> you have been expecting.<br> Thank you.<br> Uh, Fenella.<br> Oh, yes?<br> How do you know my name?<br> Well, Caryl told me.<br> What did you say?<br> I'm Gemma. What<br> are you doing here?<br> I thought you were<br> staying in Martino.<br> I'm spending the weekend with<br> friends if it's any of your concern.<br> So you're Gemma Smith.<br> That's right. I have some<br> news for you. Caryl is here.<br> What?<br> Yes, in Orzano.<br> Caryl Dubrok?<br> Well, do you know<br> any other Dubroks?<br> He's here with you.<br> In a manner of speaking, yes.<br> Now, listen...<br> I'm not Caryl's girl. I never was.<br> But you told my parents-<br> It was a bit of a crisscross.<br> I meant Sebastian, not Caryl.<br> Sebastian? Who is he?<br> Caryl's brother.<br> Ha ha ha!<br> Sebastian!<br> I have a wonderful<br> surprise for you.<br> Fenella, this is Sebastian.<br> Sebastian, this is Fenella.<br> How do you do?<br> You- you're-<br> Sebastian, Caryl's brother.<br> Oh!<br> Another raffle card, eh?<br> Which is Miss Maclean's room, please?<br> Number 5.<br> Thank you.<br> What do you mean by coming<br> into my room like this?<br> Sorry.<br> Please go. I have nothing<br> further to say to you.<br> Oh, yes, you have.<br> Look, we've been hunting<br> for you for weeks on end,<br> sleeping in the rain, bruising<br> our feet on stony roads,<br> just because we wanted to<br> straighten it out with you<br> about Caryl and me,<br> and now when we do find you<br> and things are apparently<br> in a worse mess than ever,<br> you climb on your high horse and-<br> Sebastian gave you this.<br> You have no right to take that.<br> No one has a better right.<br> Are you Sebastian's wife?<br> No.<br> What, then?<br> We belong together.<br> Then why did he assure me you<br> were only his professional partner,<br> someone to sing tunes<br> to his concertina?<br> Oh, that.<br> What about Caryl?<br> Do you love him?<br> Certainly I do. We were<br> engaged to be married.<br> That was in Venice.<br> How about afterward? Did<br> you change toward him?<br> Naturally I did, after my<br> parents told me about you.<br> Any girl would have.<br> No, some girls would have<br> believed in him,<br> no matter what they heard.<br> But that's neither here nor there.<br> Do you still love him?<br> I told you I did!<br> But did you mean it?<br> Get out of here!<br> You are mixed up. You don't<br> know whether it's Caryl<br> or his brother<br> you want, do you?<br> Well, which is it, then?<br> Caryl or Sebastian?<br> Answer me.<br> I don't know. Will you<br> stop pestering me?<br> I tell you, I don't know!<br> I- I don't know.<br> I know.<br> What a pity.<br> Where's Caryl?<br> Gone to meet Fenella I presume.<br> He was getting dressed<br> when I left the inn.<br> Did you tell him<br> about you and Fenella last night?<br> What would have been<br> the sense of that?<br> Well, what did you tell him?<br> Simply that we'd met her<br> in the lobby of the hotel.<br> I said that she was<br> waiting for him<br> in the summer pavilion.<br> Then you did have an<br> appointment with her.<br> Did Caryl know about that?<br> Of course, he didn't know<br> about it.<br> And why don't you<br> stop badgering me?<br> I had no idea it was<br> Fenella last night.<br> I wonder if it would have<br> mattered if you had known.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma,<br> why are you holding Piccolo<br> on your hip like that?<br> It looks like an old sack of<br> potatoes you bought at the market.<br> Here. Give him to me.<br> He's too heavy for you<br> to lug around anyway.<br> Now, if you'd care to listen,<br> I'll explain how I met Fenella.<br> Last night-<br> We haven't time to go into that.<br> Sebastian, I want to talk<br> to you very seriously.<br> Oh. Go ahead.<br> Who's stopping you?<br> We're leaving Orzano.<br> Leave- why? When?<br> Today. We'd have to see a lot<br> of Caryl and Fenella<br> if we stayed on,<br> and I think that'd be<br> a little embarrassing.<br> All right. We'll go back to Venice.<br> We are not going to Venice.<br> What- oh.<br> Afraid the Maclean's might be<br> going back there, aren't you?<br> We'll go to Vienna.<br> I don't like Vienna.<br> Then we'll go to Paris.<br> I don't like Paris, either!<br> Besides, you know we<br> haven't got the money.<br> Oh, yes, we have.<br> I sold the concertina<br> and... the duke.<br> You so- ha ha ha!<br> The concertina belonged to Caryl,<br> and so did half the donkey.<br> Getting rid of you and me<br> will be worth more to him<br> than a concertina and half a donkey.<br> Oh, why don't you stop-<br> Women.<br> I also sold your father's<br> autographed music.<br> You did what?<br> Sold your father's<br> autographed music.<br> Why, you- you little runt.<br> You've certainly got a nerve.<br> Well, instead of carrying<br> other people's stuff around,<br> you should be writing<br> great things of your own.<br> Yes. That's what<br> I'm going to do...<br> beginning with Primavera.<br> What?<br> Oh, I haven't told you<br> about that, have I?<br> That's to be the name<br> of my ballet.<br> What ballet?<br> It's a brand- new idea, wonderful,<br> symbolizing the very<br> spirit of Spring.<br> Primavera. Listen.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Gemma.<br> Oh, I wish we could<br> go away somewhere<br> where I could get this down<br> on paper so it could be staged.<br> You'd help me, wouldn't you? Gemma? Hmm?<br> The way you always have?<br> Are you bawling?<br> If I am, it's my affair.<br> It's mine, too.<br> Sebastian, I've known a lot<br> of rotten people in my life,<br> but none the equal of you.<br> You lie and cheat and break<br> promises right and left<br> and then think because you put your<br> arms around me, everything's all right,<br> Forgiven and forgotten.<br> Wait a moment. I-<br> You're rotten. I say it again,<br> and I say it to your face.<br> I have a star to follow,<br> I've always told you,<br> and I must follow it alone.<br> What you follow isn't a star.<br> They don't come that low.<br> But whatever it is, go after it.<br> I'm finished.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> I'm leaving you, Sebastian.<br> Gemma! Gemma!<br> Put Piccolo down.<br> Put him down!<br> Now, come here.<br> You little fool.<br> Oh, if I could only tell you<br> how thoroughly I despise you,<br> then up and leave you, let it<br> be finished once and for all.<br> It'll never be<br> finished between us.<br> Gemma, you know it won't.<br> Loving you is the most awful<br> thing that has ever happened to me.<br> Is it?<br> Yes, it is.<br> Perhaps you're right.<br> Maybe you do deserve a better man.<br> But I don't want<br> a better man, Sebastian.<br> I just want you.<br> Fenella.<br> Oh, Fenella, darling,<br> you're looking wonderful.<br> I've never seen you<br> so- so beautiful.<br> Thank you, Caryl.<br> You didn't expect me to follow you<br> to the Dolomites, did you?<br> No.<br> Oh, it doesn't seem any<br> longer than yesterday<br> we were sitting<br> in the Caf Galante.<br> I feel as if there had never been<br> a misunderstanding at all.<br> I know how you feel, but-<br> I say, Gemma explained the<br> mix-up in Venice, didn't she?<br> Yes. She explained very thoroughly.<br> Well, everything's the same,<br> and yet everything's<br> changed since I saw you last.<br> Yes. That's what<br> I want to talk to you-<br> I have a surprise for you. I've<br> come round to your way of thinking.<br> How do you mean? About our<br> getting married, of course.<br> Oh, Caryl!<br> Yes. I think it would<br> be a good thing.<br> And to make myself<br> acceptable to your parents,<br> I'm going to get a job.<br> Oh, not the sort of thing<br> I had in Venice,<br> but something<br> with a future<br> and, at the same time, something<br> which will further my career.<br> I know it sounds rather vague,<br> but I'm positive<br> I can work it out.<br> What do you think?<br> Oh, I... I don't know.<br> Where would you find such a job?<br> Oh, lots of places<br> - Vienna, Salzburg, perhaps London.<br> Yes. London would<br> be best, I imagine.<br> My father had<br> a great many friends there.<br> A music broker by the name<br> of Steinach to name just one.<br> He'd be a good contact for me.<br> Would you marry me<br> if I had a proper job, Fenella?<br> Well-<br> I can make you happy, darling. I know I can.<br> Oh, Caryl, I don't know<br> how to say this,<br> but there's something<br> I've got to tell you.<br> Last night, I-<br> Excuse me. Mr. Caryl Dubrok, please?<br> Yes. What is it?<br> I have a note for you, sir.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Excuse me.<br> It's from Sebastian, my brother.<br> Oh?<br> Good heavens. He and Gemma<br> are leaving for London.<br> London? Yes. He intends<br> to finish his ballet.<br> He says at last he's got a name<br> for it. It's to be called Primavera.<br> Primavera.<br> They're getting married<br> right away.<br> Oh, that's wonderful.<br> Well, that's just like Sebastian.<br> One never knows<br> what to expect of him.<br> Now, what was it, darling?<br> You said you had<br> something to tell me.<br> It was nothing, nothing at all.<br> So Sebastian's getting married.<br> Do you, Sebastian Dubrok,<br> take this woman Gemma Smith<br> to be your lawful wedded wife?<br> I do.<br> And do you, Gemma Smith,<br> take this-<br> And do you, Gemma Smith,<br> take this man Sebastian Dubrok<br> to be your lawful wedded husband?<br> I do.<br> Then I pronounce you man and wife.<br> Won't you buy<br> my sweet-scented lavender?<br> There are 14 branches<br> for a penny.<br> If you buy it once,<br> you buy it twice<br> 'cause it makes your clothes<br> and handkerchiefs<br> smell very nice.<br> I'll take a bunch,<br> please.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Won't you buy my<br> sweet-scented lavender?<br> Caryl! I ought not<br> to be glad to see you.<br> You have lunch with<br> Sebastian time after time,<br> but you never once come to visit me.<br> Time after time.<br> Only twice.<br> Those lunches were business.<br> Oh, you have a new suit.<br> Let me see.<br> My, you are turned out<br> in style. Look, Sebastian.<br> Well, I can afford it now.<br> My job with Steinach<br> pays me 200 a year,<br> And besides that,<br> I get commissions.<br> Oh, that's wonderful.<br> How is Fenella?<br> Oh, splendid. We're planning<br> to be married very soon.<br> Well, well.<br> Congratulations.<br> I'll congratulate you if<br> you've licked that finale.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Hmm. It looks good.<br> Well, now I have<br> a surprise for you.<br> Have you?<br> A pleasant one, I hope.<br> Fenella and her family are<br> giving a party next Friday,<br> And you're both invited.<br> Oh, really?<br> Well, it's Fenella's doing, actually.<br> She's asked Mr. Steinach to come<br> on the idea that you're<br> to play your ballet for him.<br> If he likes it,<br> he'll probably offer to<br> produce your Primavera.<br> You could use Heinrich as conductor<br> and perhaps Natrova<br> as the prima ballerina.<br> That is, if we can get her.<br> Caryl!<br> Good old Caryl. We can<br> always rely upon you.<br> Little one, I'm going to<br> take you to a party, at last.<br> Yes. It'll be wonderful.<br> And if the ballet is a success,<br> we can all go back to Italy.<br> If it's a success.<br> - Confound that gas. It's always going out.<br> Here.<br> I have some change.<br> Oh, put it back in your pocket.<br> We don't need your money.<br> Gemma, put a shilling<br> in the meter,<br> will you, darling?<br> Don't know what I'd do without<br> her and that little sewing machine.<br> Between the 2 of them,<br> they support the 3 of us.<br> Where is it?<br> Huh? Oh, I wonder if I spent it.<br> Mmm, for beer.<br> Oh, yes. The beer.<br> There you are, Gemma.<br> Thank you, Caryl.<br> Well, I guess I'd<br> better be running along.<br> Oh, would you, uh,<br> like these?<br> Oh, thank you, Caryl.<br> I have some Mexican jumping beans.<br> I thought they might amuse Piccolo.<br> Hmm?<br> They jump as soon as they get warm.<br> They won't do<br> much jumping in here.<br> This place is like an icebox.<br> It was very thoughtful of you, Caryl.<br> Piccolo will love them.<br> All right. I'll see<br> you two at the party.<br> If the baby is all right<br> and I can leave him.<br> He'll be all right.<br> Just got a bit of a cold.<br> No, Sebastian.<br> Not a penny.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake, Gemma, will<br> you stop stitching those cuffs?<br> You're going to<br> sew yourself blind.<br> Well, when I finish<br> these, I get 12 shillings<br> we can use it, I imagine.<br> Oh, Sebastian!<br> Look.<br> A 5-pound note!<br> Uh-huh.<br> Mutton chops for supper.<br> Did you sponge this off Caryl?<br> If I did? What he's<br> solvent. He can afford it.<br> And there's not going<br> to be any mutton chops.<br> You're going to buy yourself<br> a new dress for the party.<br> No. I can use my blue one.<br> Oh, no, I can't.<br> What? I didn't pawn your blue dress.<br> No, but I did.<br> Oh. Well, we'll... buy a new one.<br> I tell you, I can borrow one<br> from the landlady's daughter.<br> That's a good idea.<br> Yes, the pretty one.<br> She's just about your size.<br> And by way of reward,<br> we shall allow her to<br> take care of Piccolo<br> while we go to the party.<br> You have a nerve.<br> Oh, go on. Hurry up.<br> Hurry up!<br> Amore mio.<br> It was beautiful, Sebastian.<br> Very good, my boy.<br> Thank you, Mr. Steinach.<br> I must talk this over<br> with your brother.<br> Fine. Thank you, sir.<br> You look lovely, my dear.<br> You may tell the dance<br> orchestra to start now.<br> Yes, madam<br> We shall have supper later.<br> Oh, you are very kind.<br> Not at all, my dear.<br> May I have the pleasure of<br> dancing with you, Mrs. Dubrok?<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> Rather odd having<br> to call you missus.<br> You don't look to have<br> a husband, you know.<br> Oh, sometimes I wonder<br> if I have.<br> I suppose wives do wonder<br> about that at times.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> Oh, no, no. It was my fault.<br> I don't dance very often.<br> I wish Fenella<br> didn't dance so much.<br> She's out practically every<br> night with her young man.<br> Never spends the evening in anymore.<br> Oh?<br> Restless sort of girl,<br> but marriage will settle her,<br> I suppose. At least, I hope so.<br> Well, then why don't you<br> let them get married?<br> Huh?<br> Well, why not?<br> You may be right.<br> By jove, yes.<br> I think I'll speak to<br> her young man about it,<br> tell him it's time to dust off<br> the wedding bells.<br> I say, you're a smart<br> little thing, aren't you?<br> Oh, I wouldn't be<br> too sure of that.<br> Primavera is going to be a<br> marvelous success, Sebastian.<br> Of course, I never had<br> any doubts about it,<br> not even that first night when<br> you whistled the theme for me.<br> Then you do remember Orzano.<br> Did you think I'd forgotten?<br> Frankly, I didn't think much<br> about it one way or the other.<br> Bad business, thinking.<br> What do you mean?<br> Simply that the worst mistake<br> anyone can ever make in life<br> is taking it seriously.<br> It's too unpredictable,<br> too haphazard.<br> But you're a musician, and music<br> is based on order and purpose.<br> That's exactly why I am a musician.<br> I pursue art to help me forget<br> that life is not worth pursuing.<br> Surely you believe that it's<br> wanting things and getting them<br> that brings us happiness.<br> No. Who knows what they want?<br> Do you?<br> Yes. Of course, I do.<br> Then you're one<br> of the rare exceptions-<br> A woman who knows<br> what she's after.<br> Not only that, but I<br> always get what I'm after.<br> You do? Then you're<br> a very fortunate girl.<br> I don't see it that way at all.<br> My life is nothing<br> but a flat, stale vacuum.<br> I hate it, and I loathe it.<br> And...<br> if you changed it, would<br> it make you any happier?<br> Yes.<br> Are you sure?<br> You'd better be.<br> Once you've made the break, it<br> might be difficult to get back.<br> But I shouldn't want to get back.<br> Never?<br> Never.<br> Sebastian!<br> Sebastian, I have a note. Piccolo<br> is ill. I think we ought to go home.<br> Would you try and find a cab?<br> I'll get your things.<br> Well, good night.<br> Fenella.<br> Fenella, I want to talk to you.<br> Yes?<br> This is very different<br> from Orzano, isn't it?<br> You are engaged to Caryl,<br> and Sebastian-<br> Please take your foot away.<br> You know, you aren't<br> the first distraction we have had.<br> There have been others.<br> But, you see, once Sebastian<br> makes a conquest of this sort,<br> he forgets it.<br> You're being spiteful,<br> and you completely<br> misinterpret our relation.<br> Oh, do I?<br> Yes. Sebastian is going to be famous.<br> He's not an ordinary man.<br> You are so right. He's an<br> utterly selfish, cold-hearted pig.<br> Don't you know<br> that he's a genius?<br> I ought to. He's<br> always telling me so.<br> Would you mind<br> my speaking frankly?<br> Haven't you been?<br> Gemma, give him up.<br> So that you can have him?<br> Yes. There's so much<br> I could do for him,<br> Just as I've already<br> helped him.<br> Oh, have you?<br> Yes.<br> I gave this party<br> so that he could meet Steinach.<br> I persuaded Heinrich<br> to conduct his ballet.<br> I- I even inspired<br> Sebastian<br> to write the ballet<br> in the beginning.<br> He got the idea for it in<br> Orzano the night we met.<br> So, you see, if you<br> were to give him up, I-<br> Don't say that again.<br> Very well. But you must realize<br> that no woman can hold<br> a man like Sebastian<br> if he doesn't want to be held.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> Suppose he were to leave you.<br> Leave me? Never.<br> I've got a cab at the side gate.<br> Thank you.<br> Darling, I have good news for you.<br> Your father suggests we be<br> married early next Spring.<br> Isn't that wonderful?<br> My dress is torn.<br> I must go in and change.<br> Did you tell her?<br> Yes.<br> Good. Then it's settled.<br> And so's your brother's<br> ballet, I understand.<br> What?<br> Heinrich says that they're going<br> to start rehearsals immediately.<br> No, no. That<br> curtain is 2 bows late.<br> All right, lads.<br> This is a quick change.<br> Now, come on, ladies.<br> Off the bloomin' stage.<br> Take your limes off, Fred.<br> Take up your tableau curtain.<br> Charlie, douse your foots.<br> Fred, turn off your limes.<br> Now, come on, lads.<br> Get a move on. Props!<br> What'd you think of it?<br> Oh, it's splendid.<br> The orchestration<br> is very effective.<br> Yeah? Thanks.<br> Sebastian.<br> I wish it were your ballet<br> instead of Sebastian's.<br> You could write a ballet<br> if you really applied yourself.<br> I told you in Venice<br> that I wasn't<br> a genius, Fenella.<br> I had my heart set<br> on you doing something<br> really important in music<br> I haven't given it up. I've<br> merely exchanged composing for a steady job.<br> You're so utterly<br> different from Sebastian.<br> He cares nothing for money.<br> I wish you wouldn't keep<br> dragging Sebastian into this.<br> He has nothing to do with it.<br> Or has he?<br> Sebastian's like his father-<br> a great, cruel, wind of a man<br> that no one can leave alone...<br> that women apparently<br> never want to leave alone.<br> I resemble our mother-<br> solid and proper and dull.<br> There are times, Caryl, when<br> I'm inclined to agree with you.<br> Fenella.<br> Well?<br> If you have made a mistake about<br> us, now is the time to say so.<br> Are you trying to break<br> our engagement?<br> I am, if it needs to be broken.<br> We can't talk here. The<br> next scene's about to begin.<br> Stop it! Stop it! It's<br> impossible! It cannot be done!<br> But why? You've been<br> doing it that way for the last 2 weeks.<br> Well, in short shirts, yes, but<br> today is the first time<br> in a long dress.<br> All right.<br> Change to short skirts.<br> How can I? The role calls<br> for a long, full costume.<br> If anything is to be changed,<br> it is your music, Monsieur Dubrok.<br> I hope you're not serious.<br> Professor Heinrich.<br> Madame Natrova,<br> if you would, perhaps-<br> May I make a suggestion?<br> Yes. What is it?<br> I was thinking that perhaps<br> something of Tchaikovsky<br> might be used at this point.<br> But Tchaikovsky!<br> That's wonderful!<br> His music is always good.<br> Don't you think so,<br> Monsieur Dubrok?<br> Certainly, madam, yes.<br> No one appreciates<br> Tchaikovsky more than I,<br> but not in my ballet.<br> This is my music, and it's<br> going to remain my music!<br> I tell you,<br> it cannot be danced!<br> The tempo is too fast,<br> too exhausting,<br> and just when I must catch<br> my breath before the finale!<br> What about a slower<br> tempo, Sebastian? What?<br> What do you want me to<br> do, change a Spring waltz<br> into some sort of<br> funeral dirge? Nonsense<br> I have spent weeks on my solo.<br> It must be done my way<br> or not at all!<br> Excuse me. Would you<br> tell Mr. Dubrok<br> I would like to speak<br> with him, please?<br> I can't go<br> out there now, miss.<br> Yes, but my baby<br> is very sick. Please.<br> I'm sorry, miss.<br> All right.<br> If she can't dance it,<br> let's get someone who can!<br> People come to see Natrova,<br> not to listen to the music<br> of an unknown composer.<br> If they'd sooner watch some<br> kangaroo hop around the stage-<br> Enough of this!<br> Both of you!<br> I'm finished!<br> We are dismissed!<br> We are dismissed!<br> Sebastian-<br> Don't you realize<br> what this will mean?<br> The posters are all<br> ready. Some of them are up.<br> Well, take them down, burn them,<br> do anything you want<br> with them. I don't care.<br> Don't argue with him.<br> It's useless.<br> Sebastian, Sebastian,<br> please come home with me.<br> The baby is very sick,<br> and I'm so frightened.<br> Is he? Well, get<br> a doctor for him.<br> But how can I? We have no money.<br> Darling, please, please, don't<br> you see I've got so much on mind?<br> I've got to have time to think.<br> I must talk to you, Sebastian.<br> Caryl, I was right, wasn't I?<br> That stupid, preening woman<br> With her ridiculous airs and-<br> It's not the ballet I want<br> to discuss at the moment.<br> Oh? What is it?<br> It's Fenella.<br> Fenella? Doesn't<br> anybody care about the music?<br> At least I expected you, a musician-<br> You're in no position<br> to force issues.<br> You behaved like a fool.<br> Thanks.<br> Thanks very much.<br> Don't let them do anything<br> to your music, Sebastian.<br> Fenella.<br> Why did you stay?<br> Well, I...<br> I thought there might<br> be something I can do.<br> Did you? How nice of you.<br> There isn't.<br> I'm not engaged to Caryl anymore.<br> Oh, but that's silly.<br> Caryl's a wonderful fellow.<br> What happened?<br> Please let's not talk about him.<br> I wish I could get away.<br> I hate London.<br> So do I.<br> I wish I could get away<br> somewhere, too,<br> somewhere where I could<br> pull myself together and-<br> I know a place, in the country.<br> Do you? Where?<br> Down in Kent.<br> It belongs to my family. It's lovely-<br> quiet and...<br> Is it?<br> Here we go.<br> He's coming now, darling.<br> Shh.<br> How is he?<br> Mrs. Cooper gave me some<br> medicine, and he's quieter now.<br> That's good. You shouldn't<br> let it upset you so much.<br> Babies always have earaches<br> or something like that.<br> Sorry I blew up<br> like that at rehearsal<br> Oh, that's all right. Now that<br> you're home, I'm not so frightened.<br> That's the last time I'll<br> ever write a ballet, I swear.<br> But, Sebastian,<br> there's money in it.<br> And when they do pay you<br> for the ballet,<br> do you think we could<br> use some of it for-<br> well, to get some<br> warm things for Piccolo?<br> He just can't stand<br> this cold climate.<br> Fat chance there is of<br> them paying me anything.<br> You mean they won't pay you?<br> Oh, but, Sebastian,<br> that can't be.<br> The ballet might not<br> go on at all.<br> Oh, don't worry about it.<br> Something will turn up.<br> It always does.<br> I wonder.<br> I had to do it. There comes a point<br> when one more compromise<br> would have ruined the music.<br> That point was reached<br> this afternoon.<br> Well, that's that.<br> No ballet, no money.<br> Money's not that important.<br> Not to you, perhaps.<br> What do you want me<br> to do, hack work?<br> If so, you're going to<br> be very disappointed.<br> You always seem to be<br> complaining.<br> Because I don't make you<br> a fortune, I suppose-<br> Oh, it isn't that, Sebastian.<br> The baby's sick, and I'm tired,<br> and I don't consider a<br> shilling for the gas meter a fortune.<br> What are you doing<br> with those clothes?<br> I've got to go down<br> to Surrey tonight.<br> Why?<br> To see Natrova,<br> make her listen to reason.<br> She's down there,<br> staying with friends.<br> But you said everything was over<br> with the ballet and finished.<br> Exactly. That's why I have<br> to go down and see her.<br> You said yourself you wanted the ballet<br> to go on, didn't you?<br> Don't lie to me, Sebastian.<br> You're not going down there<br> to talk to Natrova.<br> I know you too well.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> You know exactly what I mean.<br> No, I don't, but I do know one thing<br> - I'm getting out of here.<br> So you were going down to Surrey<br> to talk to Natrova, were you?<br> Yes, I was!<br> You liar!<br> I know who you were<br> going to see-<br> Fenella, and don't try to deny it.<br> Well, go on. Get out of here.<br> I don't need you. Go to her.<br> Let her tell you<br> what a genius you are!<br> Wait a minute. You'll<br> ruin that, you little fool.<br> That's yours<br> as much as it is mine.<br> Mine?<br> It's never been mine!<br> It belongs to Fenella.<br> You wrote it for her.<br> That night in Orzano, you<br> got the idea for it, remember?<br> Well, go on. Take your<br> precious ballet to her.<br> And I hope I never set eyes on<br> it, or you again, as long as I live!<br> You mean that?<br> Yes. Yes, I do!<br> Now, get out of here!<br> Get out!<br> Get out.<br> Who is it?<br> Caryl.<br> Oh. Caryl, would you<br> mind putting a shilling<br> in the gas meter, please?<br> Where's Sebastian?<br> He's gone.<br> When will he be back?<br> He won't.<br> I'm sorry, Gemma.<br> What was it you wanted<br> to talk to him about?<br> Fenella and I have<br> broken our engagement.<br> Oh.<br> Piccolo! Piccolo!<br> Oh, Caryl!<br> Mrs. Cooper! Mrs. Cooper!<br> Yes. What is it?<br> Please, Piccolo is<br> terribly sick. I know he is.<br> Would you try and do something?<br> Do you think a little warm oil<br> in his hair might help?<br> I think you ought to take<br> him to the hospital, ducky.<br> They'd know what<br> to do with him there.<br> That sounds like good advice, Gemma.<br> Yes, but I'd have to<br> stay there with him.<br> You see, he just couldn't stand<br> it with a lot of strange people.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'll go with you.<br> Nothing could happen to him,<br> could it, Caryl?<br> He's so little.<br> It just wouldn't be fair.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Cooper.<br> He is quiet now.<br> Do you think he's a little better?<br> You should have brought him sooner.<br> Oh, yes, I know, but-<br> There's nothing we can do now.<br> Well, then give him<br> back to me. I will take care of him.<br> It's too late.<br> No. That's a lie,<br> a dirty, hospital lie!<br> Give him back to me!<br> Give him back to me,<br> do you hear?<br> That's a lie!<br> Give him back to me!<br> It's a lie! It's a lie!<br> He'll be all right, Caryl.<br> He'll be all right.<br> It's just this awful<br> English weather.<br> As soon as he gets better, I'm<br> going to take him back to Italy,<br> where there's sun.<br> That's all he needs...<br> because back in Italy, he was<br> well and happy all the time.<br> And in Venice, he was...<br> in Venice, he was...<br> come on. Let me buy you a cup<br> of coffee. You're- you're cold.<br> A cup of coffee, please.<br> Here you are, sir.<br> You know, back in Venice,<br> I was going to marry Dino.<br> Dino was a baker. We would have<br> had all the bread we needed.<br> Caryl, you must marry.<br> You must marry Fenella<br> and be very happy<br> and live in a little warm house,<br> and every morning<br> when you go to work,<br> you will leave<br> your little house,<br> and you will have an attach<br> case full of music and contracts,<br> and Fenella will wave good-bye<br> to you from the window-<br> Please, Gemma-<br> Oh, Caryl, please don't<br> let her go. Bring her back.<br> Marry her and never leave her...<br> because people<br> have to be families.<br> There has to be<br> a mother and a father,<br> And the father has to go to work<br> and the children go to school,<br> and then the children come home,<br> and they play.<br> Oh, Piccolo! Piccolo!<br> Gemma!<br> Gemma!<br> Gemma! Gemma!<br> Oh, not tonight.<br> Hey, I'll be needing that.<br> Tonight's too precious.<br> Later on,<br> you'll bring me back that bottle<br> with your own little hands.<br> Oh? Why should I?<br> You'll see.<br> To us. All the people who like<br> us and all the ones who don't.<br> Drink up. It'll help.<br> Oh, it was so cold and strange<br> on the way down here.<br> Let's go and sit by the fire.<br> Yes. It's burning nicely, isn't it?<br> What do you see in the fire?<br> Coal.<br> Oh, don't you see us?<br> I do, the way we're going to be,<br> perhaps in this very house.<br> It'll be mine one day, you know.<br> Will it?<br> Nice... parties, rooms full of<br> flowers and music, nice people.<br> Oh, nice. Will you stop<br> using that stupid word?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean it, darling.<br> Oh, everything's going<br> to be wonderful, isn't it?<br> No more poverty for you,<br> no worry, no Gemma.<br> Let's leave Gemma out of it.<br> Out of it? Of course.<br> I quite like Gemma. I think<br> she has a lot of good in her.<br> Some of these girls have.<br> What girls?<br> Well, her sort.<br> Father says that every genius<br> has some little creature<br> like that in his past<br> because when he's<br> starving in a garret,<br> he has to have someone cheap.<br> Of course, they don't understand<br> about his art or his career,<br> but they're useful.<br> Useful...<br> loyal...<br> unselfish...<br> forgiving.<br> Why are you<br> doing them up again?<br> Because I'm taking you home, my dear.<br> So...<br> You're angry.<br> No. Grateful.<br> Look at me.<br> Even the most selfish pig may have...<br> may have something he won't face,<br> even though it's the only decent thing<br> that ever happened to him.<br> I was afraid.<br> That's it.<br> I was afraid to admit<br> what Gemma meant to me<br> because, I suppose,<br> I wanted to go on<br> being a selfish pig.<br> Sebastian, you mean<br> you brought me down here-<br> And that's the luckiest thing<br> that ever happened to you...<br> because I'm taking<br> you back, to Caryl.<br> Caryl- he's your kind of man.<br> And Gemma- Gemma's<br> my kind of woman.<br> Look, Fenella,<br> you're a sensible girl.<br> What you want is a nice<br> marriage, a nice husband-<br> Now you're using<br> that word "nice. "<br> Ha ha ha!<br> I'll give it to you,<br> for a wedding present.<br> Friends?<br> Please?<br> Good friends.<br> Where's Gemma?<br> She's gone.<br> The baby died<br> while you and Fenella...<br> Good evening.<br> Oh, it's going to be<br> a great success, Sebastian.<br> Any word from her?<br> Nothing. I've looked<br> all over London.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Good luck tonight.<br> Gemma!<br> Gemma!<br> Gemma. I hoped you'd come.<br> I don't want to talk to you. Please-<br> They're going to<br> start. Let me go. Let me go!<br> Gemma! Gemma, wait.<br> Please.<br> Gemma, I don't know what to say.<br> Say nothing. It's better.<br> I didn't know about Piccolo.<br> Don't tell me<br> you're sorry, Sebastian.<br> Be like you always were<br> - not sorry about anything.<br> I wasn't going to say<br> that I'm sorry.<br> That's such a-<br> such a small word.<br> It's so easy for people to be sorry,<br> but no one can tell what it<br> means to a mother to lose a child,<br> because she's the only<br> one who understands,<br> who can imagine the kind of man<br> he was going to grow up to be.<br> I loved the little<br> fellow, too, Gemma,<br> in my own way.<br> Oh, Sebastian...<br> listen.<br> Your music.<br> Yours, too.<br> I could never have<br> written it without you.<br> You know that, don't you?<br> No. Don't lie to me,<br> not at a time like this.<br> I'm not.<br> Look.<br> I wrote it for you<br> long ago, in Venice.<br> It's your song.<br> You're hurt.<br> When we get home, I'll...<br> I'll try to change.<br> Perhaps- perhaps in time,<br> I'll be a better man.<br> But I don't want<br> a better man, Sebastian.<br> I just want you.<br>
