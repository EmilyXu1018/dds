                        Montauk train on track "B."<br> Random thoughts<br> for Valentine's Day, 2004.<br> Today is a holiday invented<br> by greeting card companies...<br> Last call...<br> to make people<br> feel like crap.<br> I ditched work today.<br> Took a train out to Montauk.<br> Montauk train boarding<br> on track "B."<br> I don't know why.<br> Aah!<br> I'm not an impulsive person.<br> I guess I just woke up<br> in a funk this morning.<br> I gotta get my car fixed.<br> Hi. Cindy?<br> It's Joel. Joel!<br> Listen, I don't<br> feel very well today.<br> No, food poisoning,<br> I think.<br> It's goddamn freezing on this beach.<br> Montauk in February.<br> Brilliant, Joel.<br> Page is ripped out.<br> Don't remember doing that.<br> It appears this is<br> my first entry in two years.<br> Sand is overrated.<br> It's just tiny little rocks.<br> If only I could<br> meet someone new.<br> I guess my chances of that happening<br> are somewhat diminished,<br> seeing that I'm incapable<br> of making eye contact<br> with a woman I don't know.<br> Maybe I should<br> get back together with Naomi.<br> She was nice.<br> Nice is good.<br> She loved me.<br> Why do I fall in love<br> with every woman I see...<br> who shows me<br> the least bit of attention?<br> Hi.<br> I'm sorry?<br> - I just said hi.<br> - Hi. Hello. Hi.<br> Okay if I sit closer?<br> How far are you going?<br> Uh, Rockville Center.<br> Get out! Me too!<br> Really?<br> What are the odds?<br> Do I know you?<br> Do you ever shop<br> at Barnes & Noble?<br> Sure. Sure.<br> That's it!<br> Yeah?<br> I've seen you, man!<br> Book slave there<br> for, like, five years now.<br> Ah. I would have thought<br> I would've remembered you.<br> Jesus! Is it five years?<br> It might be the hair.<br> What might?<br> It changes a lot.<br> The color.<br> That's why you might not<br> recognize me.<br> It's called Blue Ruin,<br> the color.<br> Right. Yeah.<br> Snappy name, huh?<br> I like it.<br> Yeah.<br> Anyway, this company<br> makes a whole line of colors<br> with equally snappy names.<br> Red... Red Menace,<br> Yellow Fever,<br> Green Revolution.<br> That'd be a job,<br> coming up with those names.<br> You think there could<br> possibly be a job like that?<br> I mean, how many hair colors<br> could there be? Fifty, maybe.<br> Someone's got that job.<br> Agent Orange!<br> I came up with that one.<br> I apply my personality<br> in a paste.<br> Oh, I doubt that very much.<br> Well, you don't know me,<br> so...<br> you don't know, do you?<br> Sorry. I was just...<br> I'm trying to be nice.<br> Yeah. I got it.<br> My name's Clementine,<br> by the way.<br> I'm Joel.<br> Hi, Joel.<br> Hey.<br> No jokes about my name.<br> Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.<br> You're trying to be nice.<br> I don't know any jokes<br> about your name.<br> Huckleberry Hound.<br> I don't know what that means.<br> Huckleberry Hound?<br> What are you, nuts?<br> It's been suggested.<br> No?<br> I'm sorry. Just...<br> It's a pretty name, though.<br> It really is nice.<br> It's, uh...<br> It means "merciful."<br> Right? Clemency?<br> Although it hardly fits.<br> I'm a vindictive little bitch,<br> truth be told.<br> Gee, I-I wouldn't<br> think that about you.<br> Why wouldn't you<br> think that about me?<br> I don't know.<br> I just...<br> I don't know.<br> I just, uh...<br> You seem nice, so...<br> Oh, now I'm nice?<br> Oh, God. Don't you know<br> any other adjectives?<br> I don't need "nice."<br> I don't need myself to be it,<br> and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.<br> Okay.<br> Joel?<br> It's Joel, right?<br> Yes.<br> I'm sorry I yelled at you.<br> I'm a little out of sorts today.<br> My embarrassing admission is,<br> I really like<br> that you're nice right now.<br> I mean, I can't tell<br> from one moment to the next<br> what I'm gonna like,<br> but right now...<br> I'm glad you are.<br> I have so much stuff<br> that, uh, I probably should, uh...<br> Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.<br> I-I'm writing, and...<br> No, no. I just...<br> Sure. No. That's okay.<br> I just have...<br> You know, this is...<br> Okay.<br> - Ohh! Hey!<br> - Take care, then.<br> Jesus!<br> Hi. I could, uh,<br> give you a ride, if you need.<br> It's cold.<br> Yeah. Okay. Yeah.<br> Yeah?<br> It is frosty.<br> You're not a stalker<br> or anything, right?<br> I'm not a stalker.<br> You're the one that talked to me.<br> Remember?<br> That is the oldest trick<br> in the stalker book.<br> Really?<br> There's a stalker book?<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Okay.<br> I gotta read that one.<br> Look, I'm sorry if I came off<br> sorta nutso. I'm not, really.<br> Oh, it's okay.<br> I didn't think you were.<br> Did you wanna have a drink?<br> I have lots of drinks,<br> and I could, um...<br> Um...<br> Never mind.<br> Sorry. That was stupid.<br> I'm embarrassed now.<br> No, no, no, no.<br> Good night, Joel.<br> Two Blue Ruins.<br> Thank you.<br> Drink up, young man.<br> It'll make<br> the whole seduction part<br> less repugnant.<br> I'm just kidding!<br> Come on.<br> You're kinda closed-mouthed,<br> aren't you?<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's just, you know,<br> my life isn't that interesting.<br> I go to work, I come home.<br> Don't know what to say.<br> You should read my journal.<br> I mean, it's just... blank.<br> Really?<br> Does that make you<br> sad or anxious?<br> I mean, I'm always anxious,<br> thinking I'm not living<br> my life to the fullest,<br> taking advantage<br> of every possibility,<br> making sure<br> I'm not wasting one second<br> of the little time I have.<br> I think about that.<br> Yeah?<br> You're really nice.<br> Ohh!<br> God, I have to<br> stop saying that.<br> I'm gonna marry you.<br> I know it.<br> Um... okay.<br> Joel, you should come up<br> to the Charles with me sometime.<br> It gets frozen this time of year.<br> That sounds scary.<br> Exactly.<br> I'll pack a picnic.<br> A night picnic.<br> Night picnics are different.<br> And, um, we could...<br> Sounds good.<br> But I... I should, uh, go.<br> Now.<br> You should stay.<br> No, I really... I'm... I...<br> I have to get up so early.<br> I would like you<br> to call me.<br> Would you do that?<br> I would like it.<br> Yes.<br> Wish me a happy Valentine's Day<br> when you call!<br> That'd be nice.<br> What took you so long?<br> I just walked in.<br> Mm-hmm. You miss me?<br> Yeah.<br> Oddly enough, I do.<br> Oh!<br> You said "I do."<br> I guess that means were married.<br> I guess so.<br> Tomorrow night?<br> Honeymoon on ice?<br> It's really solid<br> this time of year.<br> Whoa! I don't know.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Eee!<br> Come on.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Whew.<br> Oh. So beautiful.<br> Isn't it?<br> Uh, don't go too far.<br> - Whoo! Oww! Ow!<br> - Whoa! Oh!<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Ouch! Fuck it.<br> Ohh! Oh, my ass!<br> I think I should go back.<br> Come on. Come on!<br> What if it breaks?<br> - "What if"?<br> Do you really care right now?<br> - Huh?<br> Come here.

Why?<br> Why did you do that?<br> Wait, wait, wait, wait!<br> I'm sorry, Doctor.<br> He just barged right in here.<br> Okay. I want it done.<br> I told him pre-Valentine's Day<br> is our busy time.<br> - Oh, th-th-that's... that's okay, Mary.<br> - But there are people waiting.<br> Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh...<br> to come inside.<br> And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.<br> Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Now, the, uh...<br> the first thing<br> we need you to do, Mr. Barish,<br> is to go home...<br> and collect everything you own<br> that has some association with Clementine.<br> Anything.<br> And we'll use these items to create<br> a map of Clementine in your brain.<br> Okay?<br> So we'll need, uh,<br> uh, photos, clothing, gifts,<br> books she may have bought you,<br> CDs you may have bought together,<br> journal entries.<br> We want to empty your home...<br> We want to empty your life<br> of Clementine.<br> And after the mapping is done,<br> our technicians will do the erasing<br> in your home tonight.<br> That way, when you awake<br> in the morning,<br> you'll find yourself in your own bed<br> as if nothing had happened...<br> a new life awaiting you.<br> Wake up, buddy!<br> No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.<br> You can't have the procedure done<br> three times in one month.<br> Well, it's just not our policy...<br> How are you today, Mr. Barish?<br> Hello. I'm right here.<br> I know it's an emergency,<br> and we'll do everything we can...<br> We can fit you in on the first of March.<br> Maybe you could talk to the doctor,<br> a- and he...<br> All right, so let's make an appointment.<br> What day would you like<br> to come in this week?<br> Mr. Barish.<br> Um, he's really busy<br> this afternoon.<br> Maybe tomorrow would be better.<br> Around 12:15? Can you do that?<br> February is very busy for us<br> because of Valentine's Day.<br> This is, uh, Stan Fink,<br> one of our most experienced<br> and skilled technicians.<br> He'll be handling<br> your case tonight.<br> Great to meet you,<br> Mr. Barish.<br> My name is Joel Barish,<br> and I'm here to erase<br> Clementine Kruczynski.<br> Very good.<br> Now, tell me about, uh, Clementine.<br> Uh, I was...<br> living with this woman, Naomi,<br> uh, a couple years ago,<br> and my friends Rob and Carrie<br> invited us to this party at the beach...<br> I don't like parties.<br> Naomi couldn't go, but I went...<br> and I, uh, met Clementine.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Let's start with<br> your most recent memories...<br> and work backwards from there,<br> more or less.<br> There's an emotional core...<br> to each of our memories,<br> and when you eradicate that core<br> it starts its degradation process.<br> By the time you wake up<br> in the morning,<br> all the memories we've targeted<br> will have withered and disappeared,<br> as in a dream upon waking.<br> Is there any risk<br> of brain damage?<br> Well, uh, technically speaking,<br> the procedure is brain damage,<br> but it's on a par with<br> a night of heavy drinking.<br> Nothing you'll miss.<br> Comfortable?<br> What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,<br> is actually creating a map of your brain.<br> Okay, let's get started.<br> If we want to get<br> this procedure underway tonight,<br> we have some work to do.<br> I want you to react<br> to these objects, Mr. Barish,<br> if you will.<br> There's a good story<br> behind this one...<br> Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,<br> I'll get a much better<br> emotional readout...<br> if you refrain from any sort of<br> verbal description of the items.<br> Just try to focus on the memories.<br> Oh. Sorry. Okay.<br> Healthy activity up there again.<br> Healthy readouts. Very good.<br> - Here's another object.<br> - That's so...<br> Next item. Okay.<br> Potato head.<br> Next item. Okay.<br> Just focus on the memories.<br> Patrick, do me a favor.<br> Hey, Patrick,<br> do me a favor, will ya?<br> Yeah.<br> Can you check the voltage regulator?<br> What do we got there?<br> Uh, voltage looks fine.<br> Really?<br> Well, I'm not wiping<br> as clean as I like here.<br> I'm...<br> Well, uh, technically the procedure<br> is brain damage.<br> Check the, uh...<br> Check the connections, please.<br> Oh, there you are.<br> I...<br> Why am I...<br> I don't understand<br> what I'm looking at.<br> Why am I<br> standing here and...<br> Oh, my God.<br> Dj vu.<br> Dj vu.<br> This is so...<br> All right, we should get started.<br> If we're gonna get the procedure...<br> underway tonight,<br> we have some work to do.<br> I'm in my head already,<br> aren't I?<br> I suppose so.<br> Uh, this is about right.<br> This is what it...<br> This is what it would look like.<br> Very good.<br> We'll dispose of these mementos<br> when we're done here.<br> That way you won't be confused later<br> by their unexplainable presence in your home.<br> Ah, there we go.<br> Patrick?<br> Yeah?<br> Patrick, can you check...<br> Patrick?<br> I'm getting some sort of readout<br> of my own voice.<br> Patrick? Patrick?<br> - Why are there so many wires?<br> - A lot of equipment.<br> - Does that help?<br> - Are you sure<br> you set that thing up properly?<br> How's that?<br> How are you today,<br> Mr. Barish?<br> There we are,<br> Mr. Barish.<br> That's better.<br> - I don't know if I like this.<br> - Think I might try this, then.<br> We're almost done now.<br> Mmm. Journal.<br> That would be invaluable.<br> "I met someone tonight.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Her name is Clementine,<br> and she's amazing."<br> Whoa! Jesus!<br> What? What?<br> Come on! Careful!<br> Step back!<br> Just take it easy.<br> That's fine.<br> Let's not roach the guy.<br> All right, you got that one.<br> This place is sort of a dump,<br> don't you think?<br> It's an apartment, Patrick.<br> Patrick.<br> Well, not a dump, then,<br> but sorta plain.

What the...<br> It's a birthmark!<br> It did work, for a second,<br> but I couldn't...<br> I couldn't move.<br> See?<br> Oh, well, isn't that just another one<br> of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?<br> It's more important<br> to prove me wrong<br> than to actually...<br> Look, I don't want to<br> discuss this right now, okay?<br> Fine.<br> Then what? I'm listening.<br> I don't know.<br> You erased me.<br> That's why I'm here.<br> That's why I'm doing this<br> in the first place.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You... You!<br> You know me. I'm impulsive.<br> That's what I love<br> about you.<br> Joel?<br> Mm-hmm?<br> I have another idea<br> for this problem.<br> This is a memory of me,<br> the way you wanted<br> to have sex on the couch after you<br> looked down at my crotch.<br> What?<br> Joel, the eraser guys<br> are coming here,<br> so what if you take me<br> somewhere else,<br> somewhere<br> where I don't belong,<br> and we hide there<br> till morning?<br> Oh, man.

What do we do?<br> I don't know.<br> Now, look, you're freaking me out.<br> Mellow out.<br> Well, you have to do something.<br> He could wake up all half-baked.<br> Quiet. You're freaking me out.<br> Shh. Shh.<br> All gooey and... and half-baked.<br> Hmm, that sounds so good.<br> Oh, shit!<br> I'm hungry.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Oh! Oh!<br> What? Oh! What, what?<br> What?<br> - We should call Howard.<br> - No way. No, sir, man.<br> This is my...<br> I can handle this.<br> I can't call Howard.<br> He's an unbaked cookie.<br> He's... There's no time<br> to fuck around.<br> I got this under control.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Stop fucking around!<br> Okay, I'll call Howard.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, Howard?<br> Hey, it's Stan.<br> Um, I'm working on this guy<br> down here, and we seem to have<br> lost him for a moment,<br> and, uh, I can't...<br> I can't bring him back up.<br> Okay, uh, tell me what happened<br> before he disappeared.<br> Well, I wasn't sure, really,<br> 'cause I was away from the monitor<br> for a minute...<br> and I had it on autopilot<br> because I had to, uh...<br> I had to pee.<br> Where's Patrick?<br> Patrick? Patrick had to<br> go home sick.<br> Ah, geez.<br> Okay, what's the address?<br> I know. I'm so sorry.<br> That's okay. Come on.<br> I'm at 159 South Village.<br> Yeah.<br> Apartment 1 E.<br> Rockville Center.<br> Mary?<br> He's coming right now.<br> Yeah?<br> I'm staying.<br> - Get your stuff, Mary.<br> - I'm staying.<br> I think you should go.<br> Hell, no.<br> Mary... Shit.<br> I am so stoned.<br> Please, Mary.<br> You have to go.<br> Stop being stoned, Mary.<br> I don't want him<br> to see me stoned.<br> Mary, you have no idea how much trouble<br> we're gonna get into if Howard comes...<br> I look like shit!<br> Joely, stop it! Joel!<br> Look! Hey, Joel!<br> Joel!<br> I want her to pick me up.<br> It's weird how strong<br> that desire is.<br> Joel, look at me! Look.<br> You'll remember me<br> in the morning,<br> and you'll come to me,<br> and you'll tell me about us,<br> and we'll start over.<br> Pat? I just... Pat?<br> I thought we could have<br> a little cocktail.<br> That Patrick guy...<br> he's copying me.<br> What Patrick guy?<br> That guy!<br> What?<br> He's here in my apartment.<br> He's one of those eraser guys.<br> He fell for you when they were doing you,<br> and now he's introduced himself<br> like he doesn't even know you,<br> and you guys are dating.<br> Really? Is he cute?<br> Clem,<br> there's nothing wrong with you.<br> You're the most wonderful<br> person I've ever met.<br> You... You're kind,<br> beautiful...<br> and smart and funny...<br> and... nice.<br> What?<br> Okay. All right.<br> Okay. Oh!<br> Move, move, move!<br> Come on. Let's go.<br> Careful, careful.<br> Fine.<br> Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.<br> Those eyedrops you gave me<br> didn't do shit.<br> Be cool. Cool.<br> Hello, Mary.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Oh, hi, Howard.<br> She was just here to help out.<br> I wanted to understand as much<br> as I could about the procedure<br> as possible.<br> I think it's important for my job<br> to understand the inner workings...<br> of the work that we do.<br> Well, not that I do,<br> but the work that is done...<br> by people... where I also work,<br> the work of my colleagues.<br> All right, well,<br> let's see if we can, uh,<br> get to the bottom of this,<br> shall we?<br> Uh, yeah. Um...<br> Well, that's odd.<br> I already tried that.<br> Did you try going<br> through the C-gate?<br> Yeah, of course.<br> I mean... yes.<br> Yeah.<br> All right.<br> You want to get linked up?<br> Yeah.<br> All right.<br> I already... I ran<br> the utility programs,<br> and I had nothing there,<br> so I checked all the memories<br> against the printed logs.<br> Here, Howard.<br> Okay.<br> I got you a chair.<br> There you go.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> Whew!<br> All right, I'm gonna...<br> I'm gonna go through<br> the entire memory,<br> see if something comes up.<br> I love being bathed in the sink.<br> Such a feeling of security.<br> I've never seen you happier,<br> baby Joel.<br> Hmm!<br> There it is.<br> I don't understand<br> why it's off the map like that.<br> What the heck<br> was he doing there?<br> His eyes are open.<br> - Has this happened before with him?<br> - No.<br> Oh, this is...<br> this is not good. No.<br> I'm gonna have to...<br> I'm gonna have to give him this.<br> Can't you see I love you,<br> Antoine?<br> Okay, we're back in.<br> Wow. That was beautiful<br> to watch, Howard.<br> Like a surgeon<br> or a concert pianist<br> or something.<br> Thank you, Mary.<br> Um, Howard,<br> you should get some sleep.<br> I-I think I'll be fine now.<br> Why can't you see I love you,<br> Antoine?<br> Hmm. Lucky me.<br> Lay one on me.<br> Don't call me Antoine.<br> My name is Wally.<br> Yes, I know,<br> but how can a woman love a man<br> with a name like Wally?<br> Oh! Oh! What was that?<br> Hey.<br> My God, there's people<br> coming out of your butt.<br> There is?<br> - Got it.<br> - Tangerine!<br> What, Joel... What are you doing?<br> We gotta go.<br> Go on. Please, please, go.<br> Please go!<br> You can run,<br> but you can't hide.<br> Clem, come on!<br> There I am.<br> That truck.<br> Doc? Please.<br> All right, let's begin<br> by you telling me...<br> everything you remember...<br> That's strange.<br> He's in a memory<br> that we've already erased.<br> Oh, well, at least<br> we know where he is.<br> He's back on track, right?<br> Come on, Clem.<br> He seems to have developed some sort<br> of resistance to the procedure.<br> I don't want to run anymore.<br> Shit.<br> Come on, come on.<br> Hide me somewhere deeper,<br> somewhere really buried.<br> Where?<br> Hide me in your humiliation.<br> Humiliation.<br> Come on, you big baby!<br> I'm sorry, okay?<br> Let me drive you home.<br> No!<br> - Bye, Howard.<br> - No, wait. Howard.<br> He's disappeared again.<br> Oh, dear.<br> I'm so sorry, Howard.<br> Humiliation.<br> Humiliation.<br> Hu-mi-lia...<br> Joel.<br> I don't like it either.<br> I'm just trying to find<br> horrible secret places to...<br> Joel, honey, I have a surprise...<br> I just... Oh, um...<br> Uh, you know what, honey?<br> I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.<br> Good night, sweetheart.<br> No.<br> I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.<br> Shut up.<br> Look! Joel!<br> Joel, look!<br> What?<br> Look where we are!<br> Whoo!<br> Clem, this isn't good.<br> Then hide me somewhere...<br> somewhere really buried.<br> Hit it! Hit it!<br> I can't! I gotta go home.<br> I'll do it later!<br> Come on, you big sissy!<br> Ooh!<br> Ooh, he has a girlfriend!<br> Wait. What am I doing?<br> You know something, Freddy?<br> And he loves her!<br> You don't scare me anymore.<br> Ow! Ow!<br> Joel!<br> Joely, get up.<br> Come on, it's not worth it.<br> Hit him! Hit him!<br> They're not worth it, Joel!<br> Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!<br> Come on, Joel.<br> Stupid!<br> I'm so ashamed.<br> It's okay.<br> You were a little kid.<br> Yeah?<br> Come on.<br> That's where I live... lived.<br> I wish I knew you<br> when I was a kid.<br> Do you like my pink hat?<br> Here, look, feel better.<br> You can really kill me this time.<br> It's my turn.<br> Go. One, two, three.<br> I can? You're really gonna die though.<br> Okay.<br> One, two, three.<br> You're dead.<br> Oh, my mom.<br> It's... It's okay. We're playing.<br> Hi, Joel's mom.<br> He's killing me.<br> It's not real.<br> Okay, are you dead yet?<br> You're dead!<br> Uh, I think I got the hang of this.<br> I still don't understand it,<br> but I'm finding him quickly enough.<br> Clem!<br> Clem!<br> Jo... Joely?<br> Are you okay, Joel?<br> Joel? Joel?<br> Oh, my God.<br> That was terrible.<br> Okay, okay.<br> That was like three seconds.<br> All right.<br> Let me do it one more time.<br> One more, then I get to go.<br> Okay.<br> Whoo-hoo-hoo!<br> Whoo!<br> Look at this.<br> This is so cool!<br> Cool. Look out! Look out!<br> Ah!<br> Shit!<br> It's fluff.<br> Our house!<br> Come on. Whoo-hoo!<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> We gotta go!<br> Whoo!<br> Come on!<br> We gotta go. Clem?<br> We gotta go.<br> Aah! Come on!<br> No!<br> This is a really bad time<br> for this!<br> Get off me! Oh, God!<br> I don't even know<br> where we're going.<br> It's gonna be fun. Come on.<br> It's the best place.<br> No, this way.<br> No, this way.<br> No, no, no. This way.<br> You're no help at all.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> Let go of me, Joel!<br> I like watching you work,<br> Howard.<br> I guess, uh...<br> I guess I'll go out<br> for... for some air,<br> if nobody minds.<br> It looks like you have everything<br> under control here.<br> Yeah, that's, uh...<br> that's fine.<br> Do you like quotes, Howard?<br> What do you mean?<br> Oh, you know,<br> like famous quotes?<br> I find reading them inspirational,<br> and in my reading,<br> I've come across some<br> I thought you might like too.<br> Oh, well, I...<br> I'd love to hear some.<br> There's one that goes,<br> "Blessed are the forgetful,<br> for they get the better<br> even of their blunders."<br> That's Nietzsche, right?<br> Yeah.<br> And here I thought I could tell you<br> something you didn't know.<br> Oh, no.<br> It's... It's a good quote.<br> I'm happy we both know it.<br> Yeah. Oh, and there's<br> this other one I like.<br> It's by Pope Alexander,<br> and it goes...<br> Alexander Pope?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Yeah, shit.<br> It's just that I told myself<br> not to say "Pope Alexander"<br> and sound like a dope,<br> and then I go ahead and say it.<br> It's no big deal.<br> You're such a sweetheart.<br> The quote goes, "How happy is<br> the blameless vestal's lot?<br> "The world forgetting,<br> by the world forgot.<br> "Eternal sunshine<br> of the spotless mind.<br> Each prayer accepted<br> and each wish resigned."<br> I want to be<br> a great big, huge elephant...<br> with a huge trunk like that.<br> Clem? Clementine?<br> I haven't heard that one.<br> It's lovely.<br> I just thought it would<br> be appropriate, maybe.<br> I really admire<br> the work you do, Howard.<br> I don't mean to be so familiar.<br> Oh, it's fine. It's fine.<br> I- I- I- I- I...<br> I'm happy to hear...<br> I'm sorry.<br> I've loved you<br> for a very long time.<br> I shouldn't have said that.<br> Oh, Mary, no.<br> It's... You're a wonderful girl.<br> But I... You know,<br> I have a wife and kids.<br> You know<br> I have a wife and kids.<br> Oh, Mary.<br> Oh, Mary, we can't do this.<br> Oh, whoa.<br> Well, good morning,<br> Mrs. Mierzwiak.<br> What?<br> Oh, my God!<br> Who is it?<br> Uh...<br> Thank you, Stan.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Hollis. Hollis!<br> Hollis!<br> Wait. Wait, wait, wait.<br> Hollis.<br> - I knew it, Howard.<br> - Hollis, it didn't start out<br> to be like this.<br> I came here to work.<br> Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!<br> I'm a stupid girl<br> with a stupid crush!<br> Yeah.<br> I swear I basically<br> forced him into it!<br> Don't be a monster, Howard.<br> Tell the girl.<br> Tell me what?<br> Oh, you poor kid.<br> You can have him.<br> You did.<br> What?<br> Oh, uh,<br> we have a history.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Y-You wanted the procedure.<br> You...<br> You wanted it done...<br> so you could get past, uh...<br> You could... Yeah.<br> Um, I have to, uh,<br> finish the work in there.<br> It's almost morning.<br> We'll talk later.<br> Okay?<br> Hey.<br> Let me give you a lift home.<br> Fuck this thing. Damn it.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Didn't figure you'd show your face<br> around me again.<br> I guess I thought<br> you were... humiliated.<br> You did run away,<br> after all.<br> I just needed to see ya.<br> Yeah?<br> I'd like to, um,<br> take you out or something.<br> You're married.<br> Not yet. Not married.<br> No, I'm not married, no.<br> Look, man,<br> I'm telling you right off the bat<br> I'm high maintenance,<br> so I'm not gonna tiptoe<br> around your marriage...<br> or whatever it is<br> you've got going there.<br> If you wanna be with me,<br> you're with me.<br> Okay.<br> Too many guys think I'm a concept,<br> or I complete them,<br> or I'm gonna make them alive.<br> But I'm just a fucked-up girl<br> who's looking for<br> my own peace of mind.<br> Don't assign me yours.<br> I remember that speech<br> really well.<br> I had you pegged, didn't I?<br> You had the whole<br> human race pegged.<br> Hmm. Probably.<br> I still thought you were<br> gonna save my life,<br> even after that.<br> Mmm. I know.<br> It would be different...<br> if we could just give it<br> another go around.<br> Remember me.<br> Try your best.<br> Maybe we can.<br> Okay, so just tell me<br> what you remember,<br> and, uh, then we'll<br> take it from there.<br> Okay.<br> I liked you immediately.<br> You didn't<br> come on to me at all.<br> I liked that.<br> I was so tongue-tied<br> around you at first.<br> I wanted you to think<br> I was smart.<br> I couldn't wait<br> to come to work.<br> I had these fantasies<br> of us being married...<br> and having kids and... just...<br> Oh, Howie, I can't do this.<br> We agreed it's for the best, Mary.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Oh, God.<br> I'll take the bottom and you...<br> Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.<br> I can take that.<br> So you want me to carry that?<br> Help me with that.<br> Can you get the cooler?<br> Honey, the cooler is...<br> That's light, huh?<br> Oh, I can get that.<br> You can get it.<br> No, no, no, no!<br> Don't take anything.<br> I can take the plane.<br> Put the thing up.<br> Put the gate back up.<br> This is the day we met.<br> You were down by the surf.<br> I could just make you out<br> in the distance.<br> I remember being drawn to you<br> even then.<br> I thought, "Wow, how odd.<br> I'm drawn to someone's back."<br> You were in that orange sweatshirt<br> that I would come to know so well...<br> and even hate, eventually.<br> At the time I thought,<br> "How cool! An orange sweatshirt."<br> Hi there.<br> Hi.<br> I saw you sitting over here...<br> by yourself,<br> and I thought, "Thank God.<br> Someone normal<br> who doesn't know how to interact<br> at these things either."<br> Yeah.<br> I don't ever know what to say.<br> I'm Clementine.<br> Can I borrow a piece<br> of your chicken?<br> And then you just took it...<br> without waiting for an answer.<br> It was so intimate,<br> like we were already lovers.<br> I'm Joel.<br> Hi, Joel.<br> So, no jokes about my name.<br> You mean like...<br> Huckleberry Hound,<br> that sort of thing?<br> Yeah. Like that.<br> Oh, no jokes. No jokes.<br> One of my favorite things when I was a kid<br> was my Huckleberry Hound doll.<br> Oh.<br> I think your name is magical.<br> This is it, Joel.<br> It's gonna be gone soon.<br> I know.<br> What do we do?<br> Enjoy it.<br> You married?<br> No.<br> Let's move into<br> this neighborhood!<br> I do sort of live<br> with someone though.<br> Male or female?<br> What?<br> Female. Female.<br> At least I'm not barking<br> up the wrong tree.<br> You know these people?<br> No, of course not.<br> Come on.<br> They might have a dog.<br> There's no dog.<br> What are you doing?<br> It's freezing out.<br> I can't believe this.<br> Hoo-hoo!<br> - Clementine!<br> - There we go. Whoo-hoo!<br> Come on, man.<br> The water's fine.<br> Nobody's coming here tonight.<br> Believe me.<br> It's dark.<br> So, uh, what's<br> your girlfriend's name?<br> Naomi, but we're not really...<br> I mean...<br> We're...<br> Whatever.<br> So this is great.<br> Now I can look for, um,<br> candles, matches...<br> and the liquor cabinet.<br> Oh, God.<br> I think we should go.<br> There's no phone line.<br> What?<br> I think we should go.<br> Why?<br> It's our house...<br> just for tonight.<br> We are "David and Ruth Laskin."<br> Which one do you want to be?<br> Uh...<br> I prefer to be Ruth,<br> but I can be flexible.<br> What are you do...<br> Alcohol!<br> Oh, boy.<br> So, are you okay with wine?<br> I don't know.<br> Well, you choose the wine.<br> I'm gonna go find the bedroom<br> and slip into something more... Ruth.<br> I'm Ruth-less at the moment.<br> I really should go.<br> I've gotta catch my ride.<br> So go.<br> I did.<br> I thought maybe you were a nut,<br> but you were exciting.<br> I wish you'd stayed.<br> I wish I'd stayed too.<br> Now I wish I'd stayed.<br> I wish I'd done a lot of things.<br> Oh, God, I wish I had...<br> I wish I'd stayed. I do.<br> Well, I came back downstairs,<br> and you were gone.<br> I walked out. I walked out the door.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> I felt like a scared little kid.<br> I was like...<br> It was above my head.<br> I don't know.<br> You were scared?<br> Yeah.<br> Thought you knew that<br> about me.<br> I ran back to the bonfire,<br> trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.<br> Was it something I said?<br> Yeah.<br> You said, "So go"...<br> with such disdain, you know?<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> Joely?<br> What if you stayed this time?<br> I walked out the door.<br> There's no memory left.<br> Come back and make up<br> a good-bye, at least.<br> Let's pretend we had one.<br> Bye, Joel.<br> I love you.<br> Meet me in Montauk.<br> I didn't crash the plane.<br> The plane crashed.<br> I didn't crash the plane.<br> You were operating the plane<br> with the remote control,<br> and then it crashed.<br> It was fucking windy.<br> Come on, man.<br> You're stoned, and you're driving.<br> Yeah, the pot balances it out.<br> The pot brings you back up.<br> That's why I smoke it.<br> If I'm going to be drinking,<br> then I'll smoke it.<br> It does.<br> That's a medical fact.<br> It was proven<br> on the Science Network.<br> Honey, just watch the road.<br> I can't see shit.<br> I saw you talking<br> to somebody pretty.<br> She was nice.<br> Yeah, man. Who was that?<br> She was, um, just a girl.<br> Okay.<br> So I gotta...<br> I gotta drop the van off.<br> Thanks, Stan. Thanks.<br> We'll talk.<br> Hey!<br> Hey.<br> You got a lot<br> of your stuff there, I see.<br> Yeah, that's right. My stuff.<br> I take it you're not coming back.<br> I wouldn't come back if I was you either.<br> Do you swear you didn't know?<br> I-I swear.<br> So you didn't do the erasing?<br> Of course not. God, no.<br> And you never even suspected<br> we were together?<br> Once, maybe.<br> I was coming back from a job,<br> and you were at his car.<br> I saw you two talking.<br> So I waved to you,<br> and you giggled, you know.<br> How'd I look?<br> You looked happy.<br> Happy with a secret.<br> And after that?<br> I never saw you two together<br> again like that, so I just...<br> I don't know. I just figured<br> I was imagining things.<br> Aah!<br> Montauk train<br> now boarding on track "B." All aboard.<br> I really like you, Mary Svevo.<br> You know that?<br> Thanks.<br> Let me get my toothbrush.<br> Yeah. Just...<br> Where are you, Clem?<br> I'm worried.<br> La-la-la-la-la.<br> I feel like you're mad at me,<br> and I don't know what I did.<br> What did I do?<br> I love you so much.<br> I'll do anything<br> to make you happy.<br> Tell me what you want me to do,<br> and I'll do it.<br> Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning<br> just to make sure you're okay.<br> Oh. Whew.<br> Vmonos, seor.<br> I-I had a really nice time<br> last night.<br> Nice?<br> I had the best fucking night<br> of my entire fucking life...<br> last night.<br> That's better.<br> This is weird.<br> To all patients<br> of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.<br> My name is Mary Svevo.<br> "We've met,<br> but you don't remember me.<br> I worked for a company you hired<br> to have part of your memory erased."<br> I have since decided<br> that this is a horrible...<br> Some kind of teaser ad or something.<br> In order to correct this,<br> I'm sending everyone's file back to them.<br> My name is Clementine Kruczynski.<br> I'm here to erase Joel Barish.<br> What is this?<br> I don't know.<br> He's boring.<br> Is that enough reason<br> to erase someone?<br> I've been thinking lately<br> how I was before and how I am now,<br> and it's like he changed me.<br> I feel like I'm always pissy now.<br> I don't like myself when I'm with him.<br> I don't like myself anymore.<br> I can't stand to even look at him.<br> That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.<br> - That sort of wounded puppy shit<br> he does, you know?<br> - What are you doing?<br> I'm not doing anything.<br> The bloom is certainly<br> fucking off the rose at this point.<br> - Are you screwing with me?<br> - No!<br> - You are screwing with me.<br> - Joel, I'm not!<br> - You clearly are.<br> - Look, let's just take a minute and...<br> Patrick, get the fuck away.<br> Oh, sweetheart...<br> Get the fuck away from me!<br> Can we talk about it?<br> No! Get the fuck away!<br> Joel Barish.<br> Hey, Clementine.<br> Hey.<br> Nice to see you. Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Really very educated.<br> I mean, she's smart, I think,<br> but not educated.<br> I couldn't really talk to her<br> about books, you know?<br> She's more of<br> a magazine-reading girl.<br> Her vocabulary leaves<br> something to be desired.<br> Sometimes...<br> I was embarrassed in public...<br> Hi.<br> because she would pronounce...<br> library "libary."<br> Hi.<br> Libary. Libary.<br> Look what I found.<br> I think if there's<br> a truly seductive quality<br> about Clementine,<br> it's that her personality promises<br> to take you out of the mundane.<br> You made me look skinny.<br> Amazing, burning meteorite...<br> will carry you to another world<br> where things are exciting.<br> But what you quickly learn<br> is that...<br> it's really an elaborate ruse.<br> I'm sorry I yelled at you.<br> It's okay.<br> So flashy<br> in a kind of obvious way.<br> But still, it seduces you.<br> Joel, I really like you.<br> I hate that I said<br> mean things about you.<br> - Let me turn this off, okay?<br> - Hey, it's... it's only fair.<br> Where's the real Clementine?<br> I mean, the whole thing with the hair...<br> it's all bullshit.<br> - I really like your hair.<br> - Thank you.<br> I really like your hair.<br> Thank you.<br> I do.<br> The world's a goddamn mess.<br> Is it some kind of a revolt?<br> Change your hair color.<br> You want a drink or something?<br> Do you have any whiskey?<br> No, I don't think her sex<br> is... motivated.<br> I saw it clearly<br> the last night we were together.<br> It wasn't sex.<br> It was just sad.<br> Hey. Sorry.<br> I thought there was more.<br> The only way Clem thinks<br> she can get people to like her...<br> is to fuck 'em...<br> or at least dangle the possibility<br> of getting fucked in front of 'em.<br> And she's so desperate<br> and insecure...<br> that she'll, sooner or later,<br> go around fucking everybody.<br> I don't do that.<br> I wouldn't think that<br> about you.<br> - Because I don't.<br> - I know.<br> Because it really hurts me<br> that you said that<br> because I don't do that.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I'm sorry about all this.<br> I'm gonna... go.<br> I'm a little confused.<br> I don't really think I can be here.<br> Um... bye.<br> Bye.<br> I thought I knew her so well.<br> It was nice meeting you and all.<br> But I don't know her at all.<br> What a loss to spend<br> that much time with someone,<br> only to find out<br> that she's a stranger.<br> Wait.<br> What?<br> I don't know.<br> Just wait. Just wait.<br> What do you want, Joel?<br> I don't know.<br> I want you to wait for...<br> just a while.<br> Okay.<br> Really?<br> I'm not a concept, Joel.<br> I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking<br> for my own peace of mind.<br> - I'm not perfect.<br> - I can't see anything<br> that I don't like about you.<br> Right now I can't.<br> But you will.<br> But you will.<br> You know, you will think of things,<br> and I'll get bored with you<br> and feel trapped...<br> because that's what happens<br> with me.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br>
