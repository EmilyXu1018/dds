This is George Caswell.<br> You've got 43 minutes before the close.<br> I want you to start selling<br> Tredway common short.<br> That's right, short.<br> Feed out all you can before the bell.<br> Yes, I said all you can,<br> everything you can get rid off.<br> Do it in your name, not mine.<br> Okay, get to it.<br> When the Street finds out in the morning<br> that Bullard is dead,<br> Tredway is gonna break wide open.<br> Tomorrow is Saturday.<br> The market is closed.<br> Well, all right, Monday. Give them<br> a weekend to digest the bad news.<br> That's the kind of gamble I like,<br> a sure thing.<br> I'll be able to buy that stock back<br> for 10 points less than I sold it.<br> There are some ways<br> that don't seem right to make money.<br> All right, break it up. Break it up.<br> Move along, now, move along.<br> All the way back.<br> Kennedy reporting.

We'll be in touch with you.<br> - Telegram, Miss Martin.<br> - Oh, thank you, Luigi.<br> - How's your cold?<br> - All right, thank you.<br> Good.<br> Mr. Bullard's coming in.<br> He's arriving on the 5:49.<br> You want me to tell Eddie<br> to be there with the car?<br> Oh, tell him not to have it<br> sitting out in the sun again.<br> Mr. Bullard is coming here to the Tower?<br> Called a meeting for 6:00.<br> Oh, then I tell Maria not to wait<br> with my supper.<br> Oh, no need, Luigi.<br> The night man can take us down.<br> No, I don't mind waiting for him.<br> - Oh, Miss Martin.<br> - Is he busy?<br> - Group insurance meeting.<br> - Oh.<br> Come in.<br> Excuse me. Jim.<br> There's a wire from Mr. Bullard.<br> He's called an executive meeting.<br> - Tonight?<br> - 6:00.<br> Oh, just a minute, Miss Martin.<br> Gentlemen, we'll continue this on Monday.<br> Right, I'll check with Collins<br> in the meantime.<br> - Good.<br> - Have a nice weekend, Fred.<br> Thank you. Bye, boys.<br> - Do you have any idea what this is about?<br> - No.<br> - Did he say anything else in the wire?<br> - No, Mr. Alderson.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Call my home, please.<br> Tell Mrs. Alderson if I'm not there when<br> the guests arrive, not to wait for me.<br> Is he in?<br> Oh, gosh, Miss Martin,<br> you just missed him.<br> He got an early start on the weekend.<br> Well, you'll have to call him back.<br> Mr. Bullard wants him at 6:00.<br> There's an executive meeting.<br> Oh, he'll hate me.<br> I know he's already on his way to the Bay,<br> and I don't see how I can reach him.<br> Well, call the turnpike toll station.<br> They know Mr. Grimm.<br> Well, tell them to turn him back.<br> ...and has once again overrun<br> the first-half estimate<br> for experimental work,<br> this time by $23,254.<br> In view of the consistent<br> high-profit curve achieved<br> by our budget-rated K-F line,<br> I should like at your earliest convenience,<br> Mr. Bullard,<br> to discuss with you<br> the economic soundness<br> of Mr. Walling's experimental program.<br> I'm sorry, Miss Martin.<br> Executive meeting at 6:00, Mr. Shaw.<br> Apparently, there must have been some<br> development in New York today.<br> Apparently.<br> Miss Martin, was there any information<br> Mr. Bullard might want at this meeting?<br> Anything you suggest<br> that I have ready for him?<br> Mr. Shaw, I don't know<br> what the meeting's about either.<br> I wasn't probing, Miss Martin, just asking.<br> Of course.<br> Eva?<br> Why don't you wear bells or something?<br> - May I go in?<br> - Mr. Dudley's on the phone.<br> In fact, he's in the phone.<br> Oh? Well, maybe you better tell him then.<br> - Executive meeting at 6:00.<br> - But he...<br> Mr. Dudley has to take the 7:00 plane<br> to Chicago. A furniture show.<br> Mr. Bullard's orders, not mine.<br> "Mr. Bullard's orders, not mine."<br> I didn't say I'd have dinner with him<br> at the club, you did!<br> Look, will you hold it?<br> Sylvia, please listen to me for a minute.<br> Bullard's getting ready to appoint<br> an executive vice-president, and I...<br> Well, be bored then!<br> It happens to be the way I make my living!<br> Hold it, will... Please hold it a minute.<br> You don't care<br> whether I'm with you or not,<br> it's just that if I'm not there, you won't<br> have anything to complain about.<br> Sylvia? Hello, Syl?<br> Would you like a transcript of that?<br> You told me to monitor all important calls.<br> You made no commitments,<br> nothing was said by either party<br> that could be construed as binding<br> either on this company or...<br> Please, not now.<br> Mr. Bullard would like you at<br> an executive meeting at 6:00 tonight.<br> Shall I change your reservation?<br> Maybe you'll have to take the late plane.<br> Maybe I will.<br> Hello? Yes, he's here.<br> Oh. Just a moment.<br> - Mr. Walling, telephone.<br> - Take a message.<br> It's Mr. Bullard's secretary.<br> She says it's important.<br> - How's the density?<br> - Building up fine.<br> Yes, Erica?<br> Well, there must be some mistake.<br> Today is the day we test<br> the new molding process.<br> Are you sure he wants me there?<br> Well, the wire says<br> "executive committee," Mr. Walling.<br> Well, can't you put it off?<br> lt'd take months to reproduce this set-up.<br> Either it comes off<br> on schedule or not at all.<br> Yes. Yes, I'll be there.<br> What's the trouble?<br> Bullard wants me in a meeting at 6:00.<br> You're gonna have to make<br> this shot without me.<br> But how can we?<br> Suppose something goes wrong.<br> - Nothing's gonna go wrong.<br> - You think he forgot?<br> Bullard never forgets.<br> Then I don't understand why...<br> Maybe we're not supposed to understand.<br> It's none of your business<br> and none of mine.<br> If Bullard calls a meeting,<br> he's got a good reason.<br> He's a big man.<br> It's been quite a day, Mr. Caswell.<br> That's a lot of stock Wingate sold<br> for you in 45 minutes,<br> an active issue like Tredway.<br> - Where's that elevator?<br> - Relax, Mr. Caswell.<br> You said it yourself.<br> You sold 3,700 shares of stock<br> you haven't got,<br> and you'll be covering it<br> Monday morning at 10 points less.<br> Why, that's a real killing.<br> So, what have you got to worry about?<br> You're in good shape.<br> Unless, maybe the man under the blanket<br> ain't Avery Bullard.<br> Julius...<br> No, no.<br> It was Bullard. I saw him. He was dead.<br> You saw him, too, Julius.<br> I'm an old man, Mr. Caswell.<br> My eyes don't see easy money<br> so good anymore.<br> But I take your word for it.<br> - Have you got the late finals yet?<br> - Any minute now.<br> Can I drive you someplace?<br> It was right there.<br> Enjoy your weekend, Mr. Caswell.<br> - Late finals?<br> - Yep.<br> - The Journal, Post and The Telly.<br> - After I count them.<br> Oh, come on, come on.<br> Taxi!<br> - Stork Club.<br> - Right.<br> Hey, don't you want your change?<br> - Be with you in a minute.<br> - I thought you said 5:00.<br> Will you give me<br> the Beekman Downtown hospital?<br> Certainly, Mr. Caswell.<br> Take booth three, please.<br> Is that "B" as in Benjamin?<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> but there's been no one by that name<br> admitted here during the past 24 hours.<br> Perhaps it was some other hospital.<br> Don't tell me. It was Beekman Downtown.<br> I want you to...<br> Hello?<br> Thank you, Mr. Caswell.<br> I wanna make a person-to-person call.<br> Mr. Avery Bullard, B-U-L-L-A-R-D,<br> Tredway Corporation,<br> Millburgh, Pennsylvania.<br> - Take it in booth four, please.<br> - Yes.<br> Operator, this is Plaza Three, 1940.<br> Mr. George Caswell calling<br> Mr. Avery Bullard,<br> Tredway Corporation, Millburgh,<br> Pennsylvania, person-to-person.<br> That's right, time and charges, please.<br> You have a big nerve.<br> I told you I'd be right with you.<br> What's happening here?<br> I've been waiting a half hour.<br> Look, can't you see I'm busy?<br> Wait for me at the bar.<br> - Mr. Caswell?<br> - Yes?<br> How long do you think<br> I'm gonna put up with this?<br> - At the bar.<br> - Mr. Caswell?<br> - Yes?<br> - Mr. Bullard isn't in.<br> They say he's on his way and<br> he'll be there in about 20 minutes.<br> - Wallet?<br> - None.<br> - Laundry marks?<br> - None.<br> Ought to be a federal law.<br> - What about the suit?<br> - No customer label.<br> - How about Andruzzi the tailor?<br> - Palm Beach police trying to locate him.<br> He closes for the summer.<br> We should have been tailors.<br> - Car keys?<br> - GM's checking on it.<br> All they know, it's a '53 Cadillac.<br> - Anything else?<br> - Monogram on shirt, "AB."<br> Cuff links engraved, "AB."<br> Couple of predictions,<br> one, it turns out to be<br> a guy with the initials "AB,"<br> two, 6:00, I go home.<br> "I'm on the green in two. How much?"<br> "300 to 1,000." "You're on," he says.<br> So, I took my seven iron, I waded...<br> It's no good, you're going too fast.<br> What are you trying to do, carbonize it?<br> Attaboy, Don, give it to him.<br> Give me the checkpoints<br> on the time-temperature curve.<br> - So, what happened?<br> - What happened?<br> It took me four to get out of the rough,<br> and two more to get on the green.<br> You lost the 300, huh?<br> Yes, but I got his French Provincial order<br> for the whole year.<br> Twenty-eight stores,<br> That bet convinced Milton Overfelder<br> that I was the one guy in St. Louis<br> he beat that week who was really trying.<br> - Right.<br> - Were you?<br> Next time you play<br> Fresh Meadows in St. Louis,<br> let me see you hook a brassie shot<br> in back of that tree.<br> Bill, those RF temperatures<br> have to be uniform<br> over the entire surface, you know that.<br> - Walt, Jesse, Fred.<br> - Hello.<br> Do you know<br> what this meeting is all about?<br> All right, give me the figures again.<br> Didn't Fred tell you?<br> Well, I'm sorry, Fred.<br> I assumed Mr. Bullard spoke to you.<br> I don't know. See that the lines are<br> balanced. You know it's something.<br> - Everything going all right, Don?<br> - Everything's going fine.<br> Shall I start tearing up<br> my material rejection charts right now?<br> You can start to reexamine them.<br> How about that, Jesse?<br> What's production got to say about that?<br> All I'm thinking about right now<br> is a mess of soft-shelled crabs<br> fresh out of Chesapeake Bay.<br> We're rooting for you, Don.<br> I hope this thing doesn't string out.<br> I got a 7:00 date with a DC-6,<br> and I'd sure hate to stand her up.<br> Taking Mrs. Dudley along, Walt?<br> Not this time. I'll be too busy romancing<br> the chain and mail-order boys.<br> You're ready for some pressure<br> on prices, of course.<br> Dealer stocks are up again.<br> I assume you've figured<br> how far you can cut.<br> Well, no, I thought<br> I'd work that out on the plane.<br> Like this?<br> You'll find a volume and price chart there<br> for each major item.<br> Where the curves intersect,<br> that's your relative net profit.<br> Maybe you ought to go to Chicago<br> and try pushing the K-F line, Shaw.<br> See how far you get with the boys<br> with your kind of intersecting curves.<br> Mr. Bullard must've missed the 5:49.<br> Eddie just called from the station.<br> He'll wait for the 6:10.<br> Well, I'm sure none of us minds waiting,<br> Miss Martin.<br> Oh, Mr. Alderson,<br> may I see you for a moment, please?<br> Pike Street, please.<br> Julia Tredway is here.<br> - Where is she?<br> - In Mr. Bullard's office.<br> She insisted on waiting.<br> Better let me know<br> when Mr. Bullard's on the way up.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Julia.<br> Nice to see you.<br> Miss Martin says he hasn't come back yet.<br> That's right.<br> I know I shouldn't be here.<br> Mr. Bullard doesn't like it.<br> I... I had to talk to him, Mr. Alderson.<br> - Perhaps I can help you.<br> - Well, it's rather important.<br> I do think it best<br> if I discuss it with Mr. Bullard.<br> He'll be pretty busy when he gets here.<br> Why don't you call him later, Julia?<br> It's about my stock, Mr. Alderson,<br> my Tredway stock.<br> You're thinking of disposing of it?<br> - That's why I wanted to see Mr. Bullard.<br> - Naturally.<br> - Am I really as tiresome as all that?<br> - Julia, I didn't say...<br> That I've come here<br> to threaten Avery again?<br> To play on his fear<br> that he might lose control of the company<br> if I did sell my stock?<br> No. No, Mr. Alderson, you didn't say it.<br> Just as you didn't say<br> that this is the only way I had<br> - to make him pay any attention to me.<br> - Oh, Julia.<br> I'm sorry.<br> How does he do it to us?<br> Your devotion, my imagination.<br> It does take imagination, you know,<br> to think up reasons for coming here,<br> because he won't come to me anymore.<br> I had a phone call a while ago, a rather<br> strange call from someone in New York.<br> This man said he had information<br> that was highly unfavorable<br> to the future prospects<br> of the Tredway Corporation.<br> What's this man's name, Julia,<br> and what's the information?<br> I asked him that, but he said<br> it came from a confidential source.<br> Oh, yes, of course.<br> Well, if I were you,<br> I'd ignore rumors like that.<br> When you see our earnings report,<br> you'll realize<br> how senseless<br> such mysterious phone calls are.<br> Then I wonder why Mr. Caswell<br> was so insistent that I sell.<br> George Caswell?<br> Yes, he said I ought to sell now<br> and buy back later.<br> - When did you say he phoned?<br> - About 20 minutes ago.<br> But Caswell is one of our directors.<br> All he would tell me<br> was that he had a customer,<br> who didn't want his name known,<br> who is willing to buy 3,700 shares<br> of Tredway at today's closing price.<br> Provided I would give him<br> an immediate decision.<br> He said it would have to be a private sale.<br> Miss Martin, will you come in, please?<br> Mr. Bullard wouldn't want me to sell,<br> would he?<br> You know that, Julia.<br> You've always known it.<br> But you never let a simple thing<br> like gratitude stand in your way, do you?<br> Before Mr. Bullard goes into the meeting,<br> I want to see him.<br> - Well, yes, Mr. Alderson, but I'm afraid...<br> - What is it?<br> I just had another call<br> from Eddie at the station.<br> Mr. Bullard wasn't on the 6:10 either.<br> I called the Waldorf in New York.<br> He hasn't checked out.<br> - Have you told the others?<br> - Why, no, I...<br> Let me do it then.<br> You... You do understand,<br> don't you, Mr. Alderson?<br> The reason I wanted to see Avery.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I did want to make sure I didn't say<br> the wrong thing to Mr. Caswell.<br> You see, I promised<br> to phone him back by 6:00.<br> Or don't you think I should phone him...<br> Do as you wish, Julia.<br> You can use the phone right there.<br> But...<br> But it would end all this, wouldn't it?<br> If I did sell once and for all.<br> It would end a lot of things.<br> I'll check back with you.<br> - I'll see you Monday, Fred.<br> - Was that Mr. Bullard on the phone?<br> No. Give anybody a lift? Don?<br> I'm going back to the plant...<br> I guess I can just about make it.<br> - I'll run you out to the airport.<br> - No, that's all right, I'll get a cab.<br> Any reason why I can't drop you off?<br> Okay, let's go.<br> - Good night, Fred.<br> - Good trip, Walt.<br> Oh, Shaw, you haven't by any chance been<br> in touch with Caswell lately, have you?<br> - George? No, why?<br> - Oh, nothing. Nothing special.<br> Miss Martin, if Mr. Bullard gets<br> in touch with you this evening,<br> would you ask him to call me?<br> I'll be home.<br> - Yes, Mr. Alderson. Good night.<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> Yes, Miss Tredway? Yes.<br> Mr. Caswell?<br> Plaza Three, 1940.<br> Perhaps you'd like to order now, sir?<br> - I would.<br> - No.<br> - Tell Enrique to come here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> But I'm starving.<br> - She said she'd call back by 6:00.<br> - Who said?<br> Can't you talk to me? What am I here for?<br> - So, what about that Millburgh call?<br> - Sorry, Mr. Caswell, not yet.<br> Would you like to start your dinner now?<br> - Cherry stones, perhaps?<br> - Make it two dozen.<br> Go back and check<br> with the operator again.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - One of these days...<br> - You're gonna stop talking.<br> - Oh, hello, Farrell.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> - What have you got there?<br> - Tomorrow morning's Farrell, what else?<br> - Do you mind if I look?<br> - No, go ahead.<br> You'll have to excuse my friend.<br> He likes to read while he doesn't eat.<br> "AB."<br> "AB."<br> Who's AB?<br> Thank you.<br> - Your Millburgh call, Mr. Caswell.<br> - Oh, Enrique,<br> tell the operator I'm not here<br> and you don't know where I've gone.<br> - But, Mr. Caswell...<br> - And get me the police department.<br> - The police department?<br> - The police department?<br> And a magnum of champagne.<br> Yes, Mr. Caswell.<br> - Can we eat now, George?<br> - Are you hungry?<br> Am I hungry?<br> Well, why didn't you say so?<br> Flight 79 to Pittsburgh and Chicago,<br> now loading at gate three.<br> Did you hear that?<br> When Dudley dates them, they wait.<br> I'll park the car.<br> Never mind, Loren,<br> I'll be taking off in a minute.<br> Good luck.<br> Don't worry. With this under my belt,<br> I'll really keep the K-F line moving.<br> Your attention, please.<br> Final call, Flight 79<br> to Pittsburgh and Chicago,<br> now loading at gate three.<br> All aboard, please.<br> Your attention, please.<br> Final call, Flight 79<br> to Pittsburgh and Chicago,<br> now loading at gate three.<br> All aboard, please.<br> - Good night, Mr. Walling.<br> - Good night, Bill.<br> Good night.<br> Forget it.<br> If only we hadn't come so close.<br> Why didn't I give it all we had?<br> That might have done it.<br> Stop knocking yourself out, Bill.<br> I was afraid to take the gamble,<br> blow all the mixture on one shot.<br> It wasn't your gamble to take.<br> I should've been there.<br> - Hi, dear.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello, Bill.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Walling.<br> There's room for one more.<br> I've got my car, thanks.<br> See you tomorrow?<br> - Not unless you're out at the ballpark.<br> - I almost forgot.<br> Good night, Bill,<br> and stop blaming yourself, will you?<br> I'll try.<br> - Darling, I could cry.<br> - Don't.<br> You were so sure this time.<br> What went wrong?<br> I don't know, I wasn't there.<br> Bullard called a meeting.<br> How's Mike?<br> Oh, he's nervous as a pup over the game.<br> I had to chase him out to play next door.<br> This late?<br> Well, sure, I had to do something<br> to get his mind off it or he'd never sleep.<br> He'll be okay when he steps to the mound.<br> Yes.<br> - What was it for, Don?<br> - What was what for?<br> Bullard's meeting.<br> He never showed up.<br> If I'd had the new equipment I asked for,<br> nothing would've gone wrong tonight,<br> whether I'd been there or not.<br> Oh, Don.<br> I needed equipment, I didn't get it.<br> Shaw didn't approve.<br> But who listened to Shaw?<br> Who canceled the order?<br> He doesn't understand.<br> Nobody's claiming that<br> a new molding process<br> is going to revolutionize the industry,<br> it's just one attempt in a hundred<br> to make one improvement in a hundred.<br> "lmprove the profits but never<br> the product," that's Shaw's philosophy.<br> To him, the whole company is just<br> a curve on a chart.<br> And to you it's always somebody else,<br> never Avery Bullard.<br> Oh, darling, why can't you face it?<br> The dream is dead.<br> Bullard made you a promise.<br> He said, "Plan what you want,<br> design what you want. Develop new ideas.<br> "We need you, boy."<br> Sure, he needed you,<br> and it was good, a fine dream,<br> but it's over with, done, finished.<br> - I tell you, it's Shaw.<br> - And it's Bullard who listens to him.<br> Oh, he's changed, Don,<br> and you're dying a slow death here<br> because you refuse to admit the truth,<br> the truth about Bullard.<br> I just don't know how long<br> you can go on this way.<br> I'll walk.<br> He's out early.<br> The test at the plant must have failed.<br> You don't sound disappointed.<br> - Should I?<br> - Your plant.<br> Every brick, every machine,<br> every inch of every production line.<br> And I didn't need the boy wonders<br> and slide-rule experts to show me how.<br> You really think you'll be able<br> to say goodbye to it, Jesse?<br> I would've told Bullard tonight,<br> but he didn't get back from New York.<br> Monday.<br> Remember when you used<br> to bring him home to dinner?<br> The two of you would sit up<br> half the night talking.<br> A long time ago.<br> Sure that isn't what's bothering you?<br> ...officials have just<br> cleared up the five-hour-old mystery<br> of the identity of the unknown man...<br> Will you get some music, Sara?<br> ...who dropped dead in the center<br> of the city's financial district.<br> Don.<br> Why do we do this to each other?<br> - It's my fault.<br> - No, it's mine.<br> Small boy stuff.<br> I'm selfish.<br> I'm only interested in loving you.<br> Never stop.<br> I'll fight anything, anyone, even you,<br> if I think it'll make you<br> into someone I can't go on loving.<br> - You know something?<br> - What?<br> Mr. Walling, there's a man on the phone,<br> a reporter from the paper.<br> No. Not now, no statement.<br> It's Bullard. He's dead.<br> Oh, no.<br> Dead.<br> We were hating him,<br> and all the time he was lying there dead.<br> Darling, don't.<br> He was a great man.<br> The greatest man I've ever known.<br> Larry, let me see<br> those Julia Tredway pictures<br> we got the night<br> her old man jumped out of the Tower.<br> Hello, is this<br> the residence of Jesse Grimm?<br> May I speak with him, please?<br> Joe, tell UP if they call once more...<br> Is there any way I can reach him?<br> - Now, what about Miss Tredway?<br> - Getting her right now.<br> Be careful what you write<br> about her and Bullard. That's libel.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, this is she.<br> As reorganized under Bullard's leadership,<br> Tredway Corporation rose to become<br> the nation's third-largest manufacturer<br> of fine furniture.<br> A very Bullard would have been 57 on...<br> Excuse me.<br> Got Fred pretty hard.<br> Well, you know how they were.<br> You realize what this means, don't you?<br> - For Fred?<br> - He'll be president of the company.<br> Dear.<br> There's nothing you can do for him now.<br> You've got to think of yourself.<br> You worked for it, Fred, 29 years of it.<br> You've earned it.<br> You have a right, and so have I.<br> You gave your whole life,<br> lived in his shadow.<br> If it hadn't been for you,<br> Avery Bullard would never...<br> Oh, Edith, Edith, please.<br> We've waited a long time.<br> I want something for those years.<br> I want us to be paid back!<br> Excuse me. Mr. Walling is here.<br> Don, he'll need your help.<br> It's incredible. Incredible.<br> I thought you'd want<br> to get over to the Tower.<br> Yes, that's right.<br> I guess I'll have to get<br> on top of things right away.<br> Let's go.<br> - Good night, Edith.<br> - Good night.<br> Miss Martin...<br> If there's anything more<br> you need to fill out your story,<br> just get in touch with Lee Ormand here.<br> Thank you very much, Mr. Shaw.<br> Fred, Don, it's good you came down.<br> Perhaps you can make<br> some suggestions here.<br> I've roughed out a plan with Lee<br> for handling the news,<br> but it's possible we missed something.<br> First of all,<br> I've taken the liberty of ordering<br> the immediate release<br> of the earnings report.<br> I didn't authorize that.<br> Well, I'm sure you'd agree that it's not<br> only wise, but necessary.<br> Why?<br> Served up cold,<br> the news of Mr. Bullard's death<br> would hit Tredway's stock pretty hard<br> at Monday's opening.<br> By countering with the good news<br> of our increased earnings,<br> we'll not only check the decline,<br> but send Tredway stock up<br> quite handsomely.<br> It's not a bad way<br> to start a new management, is it?<br> And there'll be a special release for the<br> Times, Tribune and Wall Street Journal,<br> and a follow-up for the evening<br> and Sunday papers.<br> The same basic story,<br> but with a stronger company slant,<br> will be sent to the trades and<br> the morning papers in our factory cities.<br> Lee will telephone the business editors<br> of Time and Newsweek.<br> That pretty much takes care<br> of the first-priority stuff.<br> Anything I've missed?<br> I'll follow through on<br> everything, Mr. Shaw. Gentlemen.<br> I hope Ormand there isn't handling this<br> like some publicity story.<br> I'm quite confident we can rely<br> on his good taste and judgment.<br> Don't you think so, Don?<br> In a situation like this,<br> you can't be too careful.<br> That's why I got Ormand<br> down here right away.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I almost didn't call him.<br> I was sure somebody<br> must've thought of it before I did.<br> Apparently, no one did.<br> I have made all the other arrangements.<br> The funeral will be Monday at 4:30,<br> and I've asked...<br> No, it won't!<br> The funeral will be at 2:00.<br> - At St. Martin's?<br> - At St. Martin's, yes.<br> Perhaps I was misinformed.<br> When I checked the church calendar,<br> I found a wedding scheduled for 2:00.<br> Something can be done about the church.<br> There's another point I had in mind.<br> The highest proportion<br> of older factory workers,<br> those who might want to attend the<br> funeral, are found in the 7:00 to 3:00 shift.<br> What difference does it make?<br> The factories will be closed anyway.<br> - For the day?<br> - Yes, for the day.<br> I suppose all you're thinking of<br> is the money it'll cost.<br> Not as a first consideration,<br> but I did happen to recall<br> Mr. Bullard pointing out<br> at the time of Fitzgerald's death<br> that a paid holiday would represent a loss<br> to the company of approximately $87,000.<br> And that figure, of course,<br> was before the last wage raise.<br> It'd be somewhat more<br> at the current rates.<br> There's another consideration,<br> minor perhaps,<br> but it did seem worth taking into account.<br> The 4:30 time would make it<br> more convenient<br> - to close our showroom...<br> - Convenient!<br> ...during the funeral.<br> - That's always been your attitude, Shaw.<br> To make everything as convenient<br> as possible for yourself.<br> Even Mr. Bullard's death has to<br> fit into one of your charts.<br> I don't rate that, Alderson.<br> I don't rate that at all.<br> I have only one interest,<br> the good of this company.<br> Don.<br> Tell me, am I wrong, or did the old boy<br> seem a little shaky just then?<br> - I know he hasn't been well.<br> - Don't you think he has a right to be?<br> You know he was closer to Bullard<br> than the rest of us.<br> Don, I was careful<br> to take that into account.<br> Surely you saw there was every reason<br> for me to be annoyed at his attitude,<br> and so I did my best not to show it.<br> - Why don't we just skip it?<br> - Don,<br> I wish you wouldn't feel that way.<br> You particularly.<br> Why me particularly?<br> Well, after all, we know things haven't<br> been run too perfectly around here.<br> That's one of the reasons I've often wished<br> we could work more closely together.<br> And frankly,<br> I'd hoped that now I could, well,<br> count on your support.<br> I've always felt that you and I shared<br> a certain community of interest.<br> In your own words, Shaw,<br> I have only one interest around here,<br> the good of this company.<br> Erica.<br> Erica.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - I'm terribly sorry.<br> - Now, don't be.<br> Don't ever be sorry<br> for feeling the way you do about him.<br> Fred?<br> Sorry, Don. Made a mess of it.<br> Oh, look, Fred, nobody expected...<br> You were disappointed in me,<br> I was disappointed in myself.<br> I thought I could do it, but I can't.<br> Look, nothing's settled.<br> Just because Shaw took advantage of...<br> Oh, it wasn't Shaw. It wasn't Shaw at all.<br> That was my mistake,<br> thinking I was fighting him.<br> I was ready for him, could've handled him.<br> - That wasn't it.<br> - I don't know what you're talking about.<br> It was Avery Bullard I was fighting.<br> Can't you see that?<br> I could've coped with Shaw.<br> It's easy to fight somebody you hate.<br> But I couldn't fight Avery Bullard.<br> Never could.<br> Now, look, Fred, you're tired and upset.<br> We're all upset.<br> - It's no use, Don.<br> - Fred, listen to me!<br> Avery Bullard doesn't<br> want me to be president.<br> He never wanted me to be<br> anything but what I am,<br> a number-two man,<br> never more, never less.<br> - I don't believe that.<br> - Oh, no, Don, it's true.<br> If it weren't, he would've made me<br> executive vice-president months ago.<br> - He didn't want me.<br> - Then who did he want?<br> Fred, I assume you know<br> where to reach Jesse Grimm.<br> Yes.<br> When you do, better make sure<br> he knows about the special meeting<br> of the board tomorrow at 6:00.<br> When was that decided?<br> I'm sure we all agree,<br> the sooner the better.<br> Wires have gone out to everybody.<br> I'll double check with Walt Dudley.<br> Good night, gentlemen.<br> One thing I can tell you.<br> It's not going to be him.<br> Who's gonna stop him?<br> If it was five years from now,<br> I can tell you who could.<br> Good evening, Miss Bardeman.<br> - Mr. Shaw...<br> - I want to speak to Mr. Dudley.<br> Oh, you mean,<br> you want to know where to reach him?<br> Well, he's staying at the Blackstone<br> in Chicago. I thought you knew.<br> I see. I've got to talk to him right away.<br> Would you be good enough<br> to let me use your telephone?<br> Well, just a minute!<br> The phone is over there.<br> Mr. Shaw.<br> Mr. Shaw!<br> I've got to talk to you for a minute, Walter.<br> Which chart did you find<br> this one on, Shaw?<br> Well, is that all you're gonna say to him?<br> Just who do you think you are<br> coming in here like this?<br> Eva, wait a minute.<br> This is my apartment.<br> Why don't you tell him to get out?<br> - Eva.<br> - All right, what are you waiting for?<br> Don't you want to get back<br> to your Dictaphone<br> and make out your special report<br> to the president?<br> Apparently, you two haven't<br> had the radio on tonight.<br> He's dead.<br> Bullard? Dead?<br> You're lying.<br> He had a stroke in New York<br> this afternoon.<br> They identified the body this evening.<br> The old man.<br> Dead. I don't believe it.<br> The company will carry on<br> with a minimum of confusion.<br> You can catch the 11:00 plane to Chicago.<br> Get together with your men there<br> in the morning, brief them,<br> let them take over.<br> You get back here on the afternoon plane.<br> - There'll be a meeting of the board...<br> - Meeting?<br> ...tomorrow at 6:00,<br> to elect a new president.<br> I'll want to talk to you before then.<br> And while you're in Chicago,<br> I'd rather you didn't take any calls.<br> Millburgh calls. Is that clear?<br> Naturally, Sylvia won't hear about this.<br> Look, Loren, this is not what you think.<br> I come here because... Well, I don't know.<br> Well, it's home.<br> I guess it's what keeps me going.<br> She lets me say what I want, be myself.<br> Some people wouldn't understand...<br> I mean, not knowing Sylvia, but you...<br> All I ask of you...<br> - This is a fine girl, Loren, and...<br> - Corner of your mouth, the right side.<br> Put your clothes on,<br> I'll drive you to the airport.<br> Would you wait in the car?<br> Eva.<br> Baby.<br> Look, don't worry, baby,<br> everything's gonna be all right.<br> Sure. You'll take care of everything<br> like you just took care of him.<br> Nothing will happen. Now, don't worry.<br> Look, honey,<br> Mr. Bullard's dead, and I've gotta...<br> Shaw's downstairs.<br> I've got to go now.<br> Honey, don't feel like that.<br> I promise you, it'll be all right.<br> I'll be home tomorrow<br> on the afternoon plane.<br> Eva.<br> Eva, you all right?<br> You want me to call you from Chicago?<br> Don, you'll be a wreck.<br> I'll quit in a few minutes.<br> - Fred stay long?<br> - Long enough.<br> Oh, I like that.<br> Did he change his mind?<br> It's gonna be Jesse Grimm.<br> Fred's gonna get to him<br> first thing in the morning.<br> You sound so positive.<br> Don't the stockholders<br> have anything to say?<br> The stockholders had their say<br> when they elected the board.<br> Seven directors will vote,<br> four votes will elect.<br> Jesse Grimm will have his own vote,<br> mine, Fred's and Walt Dudley's.<br> I think that Dudley's about as fed up<br> with Shaw as the rest of us.<br> Well, what's this question mark<br> after Julia Tredway's name?<br> Just that.<br> First her father, now Bullard.<br> Who knows what she thinks<br> about the company.<br> Anyway, she's never even shown up<br> at a board meeting. Bullard had her proxy.<br> Then that means Shaw has only himself<br> and George Caswell?<br> Who helped him come into the company.<br> Well, if it's all settled,<br> why are you still up?<br> Don, maybe this is the time<br> for you to leave Tredway.<br> No.<br> But you could do what you always<br> wanted to do, be on your own,<br> design what you want,<br> build what you want.<br> If it hadn't been for this room the past<br> few months, you couldn't have lived.<br> I've got to make sure that it can't be done<br> right here at Tredway<br> the way that Bullard<br> made me believe it could.<br> You don't walk away from a thing<br> like that, not till you know it's hopeless.<br> Well, if you couldn't do it under Bullard,<br> how do you expect to do it<br> with Jesse Grimm running the company?<br> - Jesse's a fine production man.<br> - You told me he lives in the past.<br> - But he's our best chance to stop Shaw.<br> - Is that all that matters?<br> Well, there's nothing we can do about it<br> this late at night, is there?<br> Fred wanted me to try for the presidency.<br> When?<br> Earlier tonight, back at the Tower.<br> What did you say?<br> I told him to forget it.<br> I'm not gonna die young<br> at the top of the Tower,<br> worrying about bond issues<br> and stockholders' meetings.<br> That's not why I came here,<br> that's not what I'm working for.<br> I'm a designer, not a politician.<br> I think.<br> I think, too.<br> Well, anyway, I just wanted you to know<br> that you might have been<br> the president's wife.<br> Come to bed, Mr. Ex-president.<br> Yes, that's right.<br> And when you get that call through,<br> tell the garage to send my car over.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Where are we driving to now?<br> We're driving no place.<br> I'm going to Millburgh.<br> But you promised to take me to the track.<br> Did I know about this?<br> What about this?<br> You're a director of the company,<br> aren't you?<br> It says here,<br> "Tredway's increased earnings<br> - "for the first quarter..."<br> - Do me a favor, will you?<br> Read the funnies.<br> There aren't any in the Times.<br> Don't you know that?<br> Then read "Situations Wanted."<br> You may need one.<br> Yes? Okay, put Mr. Shaw on.<br> Yes. Loren? George Caswell.<br> Huh? Yes, terrible.<br> Yes, I was shocked.<br> Now, look, Loren...<br> I certainly have seen it.<br> I've got it right here.<br> Remarkable showing.<br> Now, look, Loren, I'll tell you why I called.<br> Yes, I've got the wire about the meeting,<br> but it's very important<br> that I see you before then.<br> Right. I'll be expecting you.<br> - Oh, did you send for Miss Martin?<br> - She's outside.<br> What about the call to Miss Tredway?<br> Mr. Shaw, I checked with<br> the telephone company,<br> and they said it isn't just a busy signal,<br> her receiver's off the hook.<br> - Keep trying. Send Miss Martin in.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Will you go in, please, Miss Martin?<br> Would you close the door?<br> - Sit down, please.<br> - That's all right, Mr. Shaw.<br> Well, first,<br> I want you to know, Miss Martin,<br> that even though there will be certain<br> inevitable changes<br> within the organization,<br> you have nothing to worry about.<br> Your closeness to Mr. Bullard will<br> naturally be of considerable aid to us<br> in handling those matters<br> of personal policy<br> which was so vital in Mr. Bullard's<br> running of the company.<br> Well, what I mean, Miss Martin, is that<br> it would be most helpful at this time<br> if I could be sure there were no facts,<br> no dark areas of misunderstanding<br> in Mr. Bullard's personal relationships<br> that could possibly hurt<br> Tredway Corporation.<br> What are you trying to say, Mr. Shaw?<br> I want you to tell me everything you know<br> about Mr. Bullard's relationship<br> with Julia Tredway.<br> Mr. Bullard saved the company after<br> the death of Miss Tredway's father.<br> He helped her regain her health<br> when she broke down.<br> They became good friends.<br> - Go on.<br> - Those are the facts, Mr. Shaw.<br> - But surely...<br> - All the facts.<br> I don't think you quite understand<br> the seriousness of all this.<br> Perhaps I do, Mr. Shaw.<br> That will be all.<br> Strike three!<br> And Philly goes down swinging.<br> Pretty sharp there today, Lopat.<br> Oh, not Lopat. He's a lefty.<br> I'm Allie Reynolds.<br> All right, Allie, just be sure<br> you do as well against the Eagles.<br> - Who's up?<br> - Eddie Joost.<br> - Dad?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> - Low.<br> - Oh, that looked good to me!<br> Now, hold it.<br> Gee whiz, Mom will get it.<br> - Just a minute.<br> - Is that Alderson?<br> It's Bill down at the plant.<br> Hello, Bill.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> You what?<br> Now, wait a minute. Give me that again.<br> Are you sure?<br> Well, of course that's it, it's got to be.<br> Now, look, stay where you are.<br> Don't touch a thing.<br> I'll be right down.<br> How do you like that?<br> We had it all the time.<br> Oh, good.<br> Now, if we can just duplicate the same<br> thing at the correct pressure.<br> - Pick me up at the plant before the game.<br> - Pop, you coming?<br> Change in the lineup, Mike.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Oh, it's a gyp.<br> I would have struck Joost out.<br> - How do you feel, baby?<br> - Okay, I guess.<br> - Perspiring?<br> - No.<br> Well, then, come on. Let's go to work.<br> Now, none of that soft stuff.<br> Well, Mom, I don't wanna hurt you.<br> Never mind Mom, you just burn them in.<br> Come on, now. Right in here!<br> It's better than Yogi Berra.<br> You kidding?<br> - Mom?<br> - Yup.<br> - Was Mr. Bullard a nice man?<br> - Yes, he was.<br> When does Pop become president?<br> Oh, Mike, get them up!<br> Don't you want him to be?<br> Mom?<br> Less talk and more pitch, sonny boy.<br> Come on!<br> You better not wait.<br> That mixture's liable to kick over<br> and we'll be nowhere again.<br> - What do you say?<br> - I'm with you.<br> - Joe? Steve?<br> - Right.<br> Benedeck!<br> Benedeck!<br> How long would it take your men<br> to reset the platins and get rolling?<br> Sorry, Mr. Walling.<br> - Not this minute. I mean after the whistle.<br> - Can't do it.<br> No work except straight production<br> until further notice.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Orders from the Tower.<br> Okay, knock off. That's all for today.<br> When do you think we'll be able<br> to have another go at it?<br> Maybe never.<br> Hello, Fred. Any news yet?<br> He's still out on his boat.<br> Now, now, now, don't worry.<br> I'll get to Jesse if I have to send<br> the coast guard after him.<br> No, no need to.<br> There's nothing for you to do.<br> Well, I checked with Walt's secretary,<br> and he's coming in on the afternoon plane.<br> So, you go ahead.<br> I'll know where to reach you.<br> Right.<br> Where do we go from here, Mr. Walling?<br> Four years since we've done<br> anything good like that.<br> This is what we make now, the K-F line.<br> Look at it.<br> I remember when Mr. Bullard<br> used to come down here,<br> see stuff not half as bad as this,<br> and just pick it up<br> and smash it against the wall.<br> "Not good enough," he used to yell.<br> "Not good enough!"<br> Not good enough.<br> Why did he allow it, Mr. Walling?<br> What happened to him?<br> What's gonna happen to us?<br> - Hello, Mr. Walling.<br> - Hello, Tom.<br> Hello, Mr. Walling.<br> Mr. Walling?<br> Yes, Liz?<br> - Everything's going to be all right, isn't it?<br> - Don't you worry about a thing.<br> But you weren't here in '33.<br> You don't know how it was in Millburgh<br> when Tredway shut down.<br> Now, nobody's gonna shut down<br> anything around here.<br> Mr. Bullard brought us<br> a long way from that.<br> The trouble with us, George,<br> is we understand each other too well.<br> I know that all this talk of yours<br> about the earnings report<br> is part of a campaign<br> to put me on the defensive<br> because you want something.<br> You know that whatever it is,<br> you'll probably get it.<br> So, why don't you just save time<br> and get to the point?<br> There are 50,000 shares<br> of unissued Tredway common stock<br> in the company reserve.<br> I want you to arrange that<br> are sold to me immediately,<br> at yesterday's closing price.<br> - How do you expect me to do that?<br> - Oh, there are ways. You'll find one.<br> - Why 4,000 shares, George?<br> - I have my reasons.<br> I mean, why the extra 300?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Yesterday afternoon,<br> between 2:51 and 3:29,<br> starting approximately six minutes<br> after Avery Bullard dropped dead<br> beneath your office window,<br> Mr. Philip Wingate<br> sold 3,700 shares<br> of Tredway common stock, short.<br> - Wingate told you?<br> - No.<br> - How did you know?<br> - As you said, there are ways.<br> I had a sure thing.<br> If you hadn't released<br> that earnings report...<br> You knew, is that why you did it?<br> Now... Now, look, Loren.<br> I can't go into the open market Monday<br> morning and cover that short sale.<br> I have no liquid assets,<br> not a thing I can lay my hands on. I...<br> You know the way I live.<br> I'll be wiped out inside of an hour.<br> Mr. Shaw, have you<br> seen Mr. Alderson around?<br> He hasn't been in today.<br> Well, I wonder...<br> - Perhaps I better...<br> - What is it, Miss Clark?<br> There's a call for him.<br> I have a feeling it may be urgent.<br> - Who is it?<br> - Miss Tredway.<br> - Have it transferred in here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hello?<br> Miss Tredway, this is Loren Shaw.<br> No, Mr. Alderson isn't in right now.<br> Perhaps I can help you.<br> Yes.<br> I see.<br> Why, certainly.<br> As controller of the company, I...<br> Yes, I believe I can give you<br> that information.<br> By all means.<br> In about an hour?<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> Goodbye, Miss Tredway.<br> Well, what's the answer?<br> Are you gonna get<br> that stock for me or not?<br> - Why should I?<br> - Because you want the presidency.<br> Do I?<br> It's the only reason<br> you joined this company.<br> It's the kind of set-up<br> you've been dreaming about<br> ever since you came on the Street<br> with that night-school CPA in your hand.<br> For years I've been working for it<br> and now I'm going to get it.<br> - But not by larceny.<br> - And not without my vote.<br> You'll need four votes, Shaw.<br> Without me, you don't stand a chance<br> and you know it.<br> You realize, of course,<br> as controller, my hands are tied.<br> Do a Houdini, untie them.<br> But as president,<br> I'll be in a better position to help you.<br> Suppose I vote for you<br> and you don't come through.<br> The only chance you have<br> to get that stock, George,<br> is if I become president.<br> Well, I guess I don't have much<br> choice then, do I?<br> That's right, I guess you don't.<br> Miss Nordley, right away,<br> I want a complete breakdown<br> of Julia Tredway's<br> holdings in this company.<br> And bring me the personal file<br> on George Caswell.<br> You know, the SEC Committee<br> report on the Luckheim Case.<br> And...<br> Strike three!<br> Settle down, kid! Settle down!<br> All right, now, Mike. They've had enough.<br> There's Fred.<br> Come on!<br> Go! Come on, Mike.<br> Well, I finally got Jesse on the phone.<br> He hadn't heard about Bullard.<br> I gave him the whole set-up<br> and he said no.<br> - What you mean, no?<br> - He won't take the presidency.<br> He's going to retire.<br> Made up his mind weeks ago.<br> Nothing I could say would change it.<br> You know Jesse.<br> Yes, I know Jesse.<br> - Now, wait a minute.<br> - Well, what for? It's all over.<br> There's still a way.<br> - Now, look, Fred, I told you last night...<br> - Let me finish.<br> Jesse feels the way we do about Shaw,<br> so we still have four votes:<br> yours and mine and Jesse's and Walt's<br> and maybe Julia's.<br> - Four votes for what?<br> - For Dudley.<br> - Look, Fred...<br> - Walt's got a lot of standing, Don.<br> He's been on two<br> government commissions,<br> he's been president of the association,<br> made institutional speeches<br> all over the country.<br> He knows how to keep people happy.<br> He's a darn good salesman, and that's all.<br> There's isn't a man in the business<br> who's more popular.<br> Well, Bullard didn't build<br> the company being popular.<br> We're not going to get<br> another Avery Bullard, Don.<br> You've got to make up your mind to that.<br> Well, look, you can't put Tredway...<br> You can't put Millburgh<br> into the hands of J. Walter Dudley.<br> You'd rather have Shaw, is that it?<br> - Okay, it's Dudley.<br> - I'll get right over to the airport<br> and meet him at the plane.<br> Walt's going to need a lot of help<br> running this company, Don.<br> That means he's going to need you.<br> Ball one!<br> - Let's have a new pitcher!<br> - All right, tighten up in there, tighten up!<br> Ball two!<br> What happened?<br> Grimm won't take it. He's going to retire.<br> Come on, Mike...<br> Fred's gonna offer it to Walt Dudley.<br> - Come on, let's go!<br> - Strike one!<br> Did you agree?<br> Yes.<br> Come on, get it over, get it over!<br> Ball three!<br> Come on!<br> - Come on, Mike.<br> - Move! Come on!<br> Strike two!<br> Flight 31 from Chicago and Pittsburgh...<br> Fred!<br> ...now arriving at gate four.<br> Is that his plane?<br> You didn't have to come,<br> I could've handled it.<br> Forget it. I'm not gonna go through with it.<br> - But, Don, you said...<br> - I don't care what I said!<br> He hasn't the guts, he can't do it.<br> - Look, with you there to help him...<br> - It wouldn't work.<br> He's just dead weight,<br> something we'd have to ease out of place<br> every time we wanted<br> to get anything done.<br> All right, then, if not Dudley, who?<br> Me.<br> - Did you hear me?<br> - Yes, I heard you.<br> - Well...<br> - Forget it.<br> - Why?<br> - You haven't got a chance.<br> Well, then, what were you<br> talking about last night?<br> That was last night.<br> You've had a chance<br> to change your mind, is that it?<br> I'm not ready yet.<br> Five more years to be properly seasoned<br> while the company goes down the drain.<br> - Nobody said...<br> - I've never had my picture in Fortune.<br> I get my hands dirty once in a while.<br> I don't know the rules.<br> I'm not old and tired, or weak and afraid.<br> - Now, listen to me.<br> - Not anymore.<br> This was my idea,<br> remember that, not yours.<br> Maybe I was wrong.<br> Maybe I didn't realize<br> just how hot your head really is.<br> One thing Bullard always had was respect.<br> Now, look, Fred, I didn't mean to...<br> Walt will be coming out.<br> Now, we haven't got much time.<br> Don't you understand? It can't be Dudley.<br> - Look, with you and Jesse behind me...<br> - No, Don. Not Jesse.<br> I was hoping<br> I wouldn't have to tell you this.<br> - What?<br> - When I talked to Jesse,<br> I brought your name up.<br> - Well?<br> - He wouldn't go along.<br> I don't understand.<br> Jesse and I have always worked together.<br> I can't believe he feels that way about me.<br> - He does, Don.<br> - Why?<br> Oh, 20 years from now,<br> when you're Jesse's age,<br> maybe you'll understand.<br> At least now you can realize<br> that giving Dudley the presidency<br> wasn't just an old man's crazy idea.<br> Will you forget about Dudley?<br> - Without Jesse...<br> - I don't need him. I can do it without him.<br> - How?<br> - Four votes.<br> - We're two right here.<br> - Yes.<br> - Julia Tredway is three.<br> - Oh, but...<br> Why not? And the fourth one<br> is coming off of that plane.<br> You've got to talk to him, Fred.<br> - Well, how do you expect me...<br> - I don't care how. It's got to be done.<br> Is that an order?<br> Yes, that's an order.<br> All right.<br> I'd better get over to Julia Tredway's.<br> Maybe you'd better let me talk to her.<br> There are things you<br> don't know about her and Bullard.<br> You take care of Walt Dudley.<br> - Walt!<br> - Oh, Fred, it was good of you to come.<br> I still can't believe it about the old man.<br> - I've got my car.<br> - Oh, no, I...<br> I'm expecting someone to pick me up.<br> I thought we'd go to the Tower.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> - Well, what about?<br> - About the presidency.<br> Look, not now, I...<br> I just can't be with you now.<br> Look, we've got to talk<br> before the meeting.<br> This is important.<br> We're counting on you<br> to help us stop Loren Shaw.<br> Not now.<br> You do feel the way<br> we do, though, don't you?<br> I just told you<br> I don't want to discuss it now.<br> Isn't that plain enough?<br> Very plain.<br> J. Walter Dudley,<br> kindly report to the United ticket counter.<br> J. Walter Dudley,<br> kindly report to the United ticket counter.<br> Mr. Dudley, I have a message for you.<br> Mr. Shaw won't be able to meet you here,<br> but he'd like to have you<br> join him at the Federal Club at 5:00.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome, Mr. Dudley.<br> Edith, don't wait for me, I won't be home.<br> No, no, everything is all right.<br> I have a job to do for Don Walling.<br> Goodbye.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, honey, how nice.<br> I didn't wanna leave<br> without saying goodbye.<br> Baby, you've got to understand<br> about last night.<br> But I do.<br> I'm not helping you,<br> and you're certainly not helping me.<br> So, I'm getting out of here.<br> - I won't let you go.<br> - Oh, yes, you will.<br> You've never faced an unpleasant<br> situation in your whole life.<br> You never will.<br> You're too busy being popular.<br> Eva, what do you want me to do?<br> About me, nothing.<br> About yourself,<br> there's nothing you can do,<br> not while you're so afraid.<br> - Please, honey...<br> - No!<br> You go find yourself another aspirin tablet.<br> Look, baby, I have to be at the Club.<br> Drive me there<br> and we can talk this over, huh?<br> Walt, the taxis are right over there.<br> Okay, Eva, I...<br> I don't know where you're going,<br> but this isn't the end.<br> Goodbye, Walt.<br> You don't know me<br> as well as you think you do.<br> A guy can change, you know.<br> Wanna bet?<br> Mary!<br> Mary!<br> - Hi, dear.<br> - Fred call yet?<br> - Well, we just got home.<br> - Then ask Louise.<br> - Oh, Don!<br> - Yeah.<br> - Where are you?<br> - In here.<br> Oh, nobody called.<br> Well, try the Alderson house.<br> He may be there.<br> Thanks.<br> Hello, Edith? Don Walling. Fred there?<br> Well, do you know where he went?<br> I see.<br> No, no, never mind. Thanks anyway.<br> If I marry you,<br> will you tell me what's going on?<br> - Where did you run off to?<br> - The airport.<br> Oh, well, that explains everything.<br> - And now?<br> - Julia Tredway's.<br> - What for?<br> - Her vote.<br> - For Walt Dudley?<br> - No, for me.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> I'm going for the presidency.<br> - Yes, I heard you.<br> - Is that all you're gonna say?<br> - What would you like me to say?<br> - Well, a good word, a few cheers.<br> Do you really think you can get it?<br> - You got to try.<br> - Why?<br> Why not?<br> Well, for one thing, because I love you.<br> And I wouldn't enjoy seeing you crack<br> that handsome head of yours<br> against a stone wall<br> trying to do the impossible.<br> Nothing's impossible.<br> - Bullard's line, not yours.<br> - Still true.<br> Okay, I know what you're thinking,<br> but last night was years ago.<br> I've changed my mind.<br> Look at your face in the mirror.<br> - Look at your hands.<br> - It's because I'm in a hurry,<br> and you're not helping one bit, Mary.<br> Now, will you...<br> Five years now,<br> I've stood by and watched you.<br> Harassed, frustrated<br> and denied, and for what?<br> To try to keep a dream alive.<br> I'm selfish, Don.<br> I want the man<br> I was in love with and married.<br> I won't let you do this to yourself.<br> And I'm not gonna stand by<br> and let the company<br> fall into the hands<br> of a weakling like Dudley,<br> or an adding machine like Shaw.<br> There are too many lives involved.<br> The whole town is at stake.<br> Tredway has got to be kept alive.<br> Avery Bullard's got to be kept alive,<br> isn't that what you mean?<br> You want to sit in his chair<br> and be his ghost.<br> You're even beginning<br> to sound like Bullard.<br> Oh, let's not.<br> Don.<br> - Don...<br> - Hey, Pop!<br> Later, Mike.<br> Gee whiz.<br> He didn't even ask me who won the game.<br> Oh, don't worry, sweetie, he will.<br> Hello?<br> No, he just left.<br> Mary, this is very important.<br> I want you to call the Tower,<br> get hold of Don,<br> and have him delay<br> the meeting until I get there.<br> That's right. Tell him to hold up the voting.<br> Right.<br> You sure Mr. Grimm will be coming<br> through this way?<br> Yes.<br> Tredway Corporation. Good afternoon.<br> Hello?<br> Over there, please, Luigi.<br> - By the window, please.<br> - Yes, Miss Martin.<br> Thanks, Luigi.<br> Luigi, don't go in his office, please.<br> - Erica, has Mr. Alderson arrived yet?<br> - I haven't seen him...<br> - Well, did he call me? Any messages?<br> - Why, no, Mr. Walling.<br> - Is Miss Tredway here?<br> - Yes, she's in Mr. Bullard's office.<br> She left some of<br> her personal papers in his safe.<br> - She insisted I open it for her.<br> - Oh.<br> Mr. Walling.<br> Is there...<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> Thanks, Erica.<br> Miss Tredway, I'd like to<br> speak to you for a moment.<br> I know how you feel.<br> Then let me alone.<br> - I hate to bother you, but this is important.<br> - Important?<br> - It has to do with the company.<br> - The company.<br> I don't want to hear another word about it.<br> I've said all I'm ever going<br> to say to Mr. Shaw.<br> Shaw?<br> I've given him full instructions.<br> Miss Tredway, I don't want you<br> to think that I'm here...<br> To urge me not to sell out?<br> In another minute,<br> Mr. Alderson will come in,<br> also not to urge me not to sell out.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> This, Mr. Walling!<br> The funeral pyre of nothing at all!<br> Bon voyage, Julia.<br> Sorry, you couldn't stay longer.<br> Miss Tredway, you mustn't let this...<br> Oh, no. No, you mustn't, Julia.<br> You mustn't be unreasonable.<br> We wouldn't want that, would we?<br> There, there, my dear. You'll be all right.<br> That's a good girl.<br> You've got everything<br> in the world to live for:<br> money, brains, beauty.<br> So, you just sit here and wait.<br> And if you wait long enough, say,<br> maybe something else will happen.<br> Because you know, Julia,<br> no matter how horrible things are,<br> they can always get worse.<br> Miss Tredway.<br> You said something about<br> instructions to Mr. Shaw.<br> Yes, Mr. Walling.<br> The holdings of Julia Tredway,<br> of the Tredway Corporation.<br> There it is, there it was, and there it goes.<br> The liquidation will be prompt, but swift.<br> I quote Mr. Shaw.<br> You're not going to throw your stock<br> onto the open market, are you?<br> I don't know and I don't care.<br> Mr. Shaw will take care of everything.<br> You can't do that!<br> You're selling out the company,<br> Avery Bullard's company,<br> your own father's.<br> What did I ever get out of it<br> but loneliness and sudden death?<br> What did I ever get out of them<br> but the sight of their backs?<br> Bullard gave you everything you have.<br> There wouldn't be any stock<br> if it hadn't been for him.<br> You wouldn't be here at all.<br> I gave him 10 years of my life<br> and all my love! Isn't that enough?<br> Please, please, go away.<br> - Miss Tredway, at this meeting...<br> - I'm not interested.<br> But surely you want to see us<br> elect a man who will stand for...<br> I told you, I don't care.<br> It won't make any difference to me.<br> Well, whether you care or not,<br> your vote will count.<br> Mr. Shaw has my proxy.<br> Now, will you let me alone?<br> If you wanna stab a dead man,<br> why don't you do it yourself,<br> instead of having someone else<br> do it for you?<br> - Get out of here.<br> - Go on, sell out!<br> Smash everything he lived for!<br> That's what you wanna do, isn't it?<br> Pay him back for loving the company<br> more than he could love you?<br> Will you get out of here?<br> - Hello, Wally.<br> - Caswell.<br> No use. I tried, it's only water.<br> - Where's the rest of this sance?<br> - Don't worry, they'll be here.<br> Oh, hello.<br> How about a little three-handed gin?<br> Personally, I prefer to have<br> a little vermouth-played martini instead.<br> A must for the early bird<br> who fails to catch the worm,<br> Evening, everyone.<br> - Everything all right, George?<br> - Oh, perfect.<br> - Where's Fred?<br> - I don't know.<br> Well, didn't he talk to you?<br> Don, why don't you sit down?<br> - Well, gentlemen, shall we begin?<br> - We can't begin.<br> Perhaps my watch is fast, I have 6:03.<br> - There are only four of us here.<br> - Five.<br> Miss Tredway's proxy.<br> Miss Martin, am I correct in assuming<br> that five constitutes a quorum?<br> Yes.<br> Am I also correct in assuming<br> that four votes out of the total<br> of seven directors,<br> are sufficient to pass the usual motions,<br> as well as to elect?<br> Yes.<br> Then I see no reason<br> why we shouldn't proceed.<br> Well, don't you think this is important<br> enough to wait for Fred and Jesse?<br> Mr. Alderson and Mr. Grimm<br> have been officially notified<br> of this meeting, have they not?<br> And you've had verification<br> of their receipt of notification?<br> Yes.<br> George, any objections to proceeding?<br> No.<br> Walt?<br> - No.<br> - All right, let's get started.<br> Now, then.<br> Gentlemen, I take pleasure in...<br> Miss Tredway.<br> You know everybody.<br> Mr. Caswell, Mr. Dudley, Mr. Walling.<br> Sit here.<br> This won't be necessary, Mr. Shaw.<br> I'll do it myself.<br> Walt?<br> Miss Tredway, gentlemen,<br> I take pleasure in nominating as<br> the next president of our company,<br> the man whom I believe best qualified<br> to fill the terrible void<br> left by the death of our beloved president.<br> I nominate Loren P. Shaw.<br> Thank you, Walt.<br> George?<br> I second the nomination.<br> Miss Martin.<br> "Mr. Loren P. Shaw has been<br> placed in nomination<br> "for the presidency<br> of Tredway Corporation<br> "before this 116th meeting<br> of the board of directors<br> "on the 20th day of June, 1953."<br> There being present a quorum of the total<br> number of directors as of this date,<br> an affirmative vote delivered four times<br> shall constitute an elective majority.<br> Are there any other nominations?<br> Nominations on this first ballot<br> are now closed.<br> If you'll please place your ballots<br> in these envelopes.<br> Your ballot, Mr. Walling.<br> One "no" for Mr. Shaw.<br> One "yes" for Mr. Shaw.<br> Two "yes" for Mr. Shaw.<br> Three "yes" for Mr. Shaw.<br> One "abstain."<br> No decision on the first ballot.<br> Miss Tredway,<br> could I speak with you for a moment?<br> Perhaps I failed to<br> make my position clear this afternoon.<br> How about a break<br> before we go on with this?<br> - Anybody got an aspirin?<br> - In there.<br> Miss Tredway,<br> I don't know how you just voted,<br> but I wanted to tell you how sorry I am<br> for what I said.<br> No matter how I feel about the company,<br> I had no right to do that.<br> Well, Loren, how does it feel?<br> - What?<br> - Not getting it.<br> - I had her. I know I had her.<br> - Oh, you still do.<br> It was you. Why? Why?<br> I told you I was...<br> I told you I was gonna do<br> my best for you, didn't I?<br> I didn't realize this afternoon<br> how much bargaining power I really had.<br> It's not just that my "no" keeps you out<br> and my "yes" puts you in.<br> Loren, I want the delivery<br> of that stock guaranteed.<br> You blasted idiot.<br> I have it for you right here.<br> Julia Tredway's<br> pulling out of the company,<br> and I'm handling the sale of her stock.<br> Here's your 3,700 shares, right here.<br> A letter of transfer<br> signed by me, as president.<br> Do you mind?<br> Now, let's go.<br> All right, now, Miss Martin.<br> Mary, is there anything wrong?<br> - Is it all over?<br> - No, not yet.<br> Oh, Don, please don't hate me.<br> I did a terrible thing to you. I really did.<br> - Honey, what is it?<br> - Fred called you right after you left.<br> Where is he?<br> He said it was important for you<br> to hold up the voting until he got here.<br> I didn't call you, Don.<br> And then when I did try to get through,<br> I couldn't find you, and...<br> It's okay, honey. It's all right.<br> Darling, I was so wrong.<br> If it's what you want, really want,<br> that's all that should<br> matter to either of us.<br> Don, is there still a chance in there?<br> Nothing's impossible. Remember?<br> You're funny.<br> Am I?<br> - Getting ready for the second ballot, Don.<br> - Already?<br> Miss Martin.<br> "At 6:19, after a brief recess,<br> the meeting was resumed,<br> "and Mr. Dudley once again<br> placed the name of Loren P. Shaw<br> "in nomination for the presidency<br> of Tredway Corporation."<br> Miss Tredway, gentlemen...<br> We all seem to be<br> in a big hurry around here, don't we?<br> I'd like to second the nomination...<br> Maybe we're a little too accustomed<br> to quick decisions in this room,<br> to directors' meetings<br> that never really meant anything.<br> If you mean that's pretty much the way<br> Bullard ran this company,<br> we might all be inclined to agree with you.<br> After all, isn't that why we're here,<br> to replace that kind<br> of dictatorial leadership?<br> With what, Loren?<br> - Well, I was about to tell you...<br> - Replace it with what?<br> Just a second, George.<br> I want to answer that question.<br> After all, Miss Tredway is<br> a major stockholder in this company,<br> and if she, or anyone else,<br> wants to know where I stand...<br> I believe that a company is answerable<br> first and last to its stockholders.<br> To fulfill that obligation,<br> primary emphasis must be<br> placed upon return on investment.<br> - Jesse.<br> - Don.<br> - Anything happened?<br> - Not yet.<br> Thought I could swing him. He's a mule.<br> Jesse, Fred, welcome.<br> We're into the nominations,<br> and I was just trying<br> to make clear to everyone here<br> what I believe to be the only<br> sound basis<br> for corporation management today.<br> When the average stockholder<br> buys Tredway stock,<br> he makes an investment.<br> Now, the only reason<br> he makes it is to get a return.<br> That's why I believe<br> that corporations today<br> must be governed to be<br> what its owners want it to be,<br> and have paid for it to be,<br> a financial institution yielding the highest<br> and safest return on investment.<br> You know why more<br> and more corporations today<br> are drawing their leaders<br> from the ranks of controllers<br> and investment bankers?<br> Because the problems that come<br> to the president's office today<br> are predominantly financial.<br> I get it.<br> Manufacturing and selling<br> don't count anymore.<br> Of course they count, Fred,<br> but they're not ends in themselves,<br> only the means to the end.<br> It's a matter of management levels.<br> I just said it.<br> At the presidential level,<br> the emphasis must be financial.<br> Take our own case.<br> Jesse and his staff<br> have done a wonderful job<br> of reducing costs<br> on our finishing operation,<br> and we all appreciate the creative effort<br> that's been poured<br> into our experimental program<br> at the Pike Street plant.<br> But the truth is,<br> such efforts add comparatively little<br> to our net earnings,<br> even when they succeed.<br> Last year, they contributed<br> less than a quarter of what we gained<br> from one new tax accounting procedure<br> I got the government to approve.<br> So, you see, that one piece of work,<br> all purely...<br> Yeah, we see, all right.<br> While Jesse and Don<br> are turning out products,<br> you figure-jugglers and chart-men are busy<br> flyspecking it with decimal points.<br> Well, some of us have had enough of it,<br> and some of us are sick<br> to our stomachs from it!<br> I've had enough of that attitude!<br> I know how I've been regarded<br> around here by most of you.<br> Efficiency has become a dirty word.<br> Budget control has a bad odor.<br> Well, that's my job.<br> That's my responsibility,<br> to plug every profit leak,<br> to run to earth every single case<br> of waste and inefficiency in this company.<br> If I have to step on toes<br> and hurt feelings in the process,<br> that can't be helped.<br> But nobody's going to<br> say I ever had anything<br> but the best interests of this company<br> at heart while I was doing it.<br> You take a look at the record<br> of the last three years.<br> Fight that record.<br> My record.<br> Your record, Shaw?<br> Couldn't have been done without me.<br> Understand, I don't mean<br> to belittle Mr. Bullard.<br> We all recognize<br> his magnificent contribution<br> to this company<br> during its period of growth.<br> In other words,<br> Avery Bullard was the right kind of man<br> to save this company from disaster,<br> to build it up and set it on its way.<br> But now, we need<br> a different kind of management,<br> one that will dedicate itself to paying<br> the maximum dividends<br> to the stockholders.<br> Is that it?<br> I don't know that I'd express it<br> in exactly those terms,<br> but, yes, that's substantially<br> what I do mean.<br> Shaw, let me ask you something.<br> The president of a company like Tredway<br> would have to be a man<br> - of outstanding qualities, wouldn't he?<br> - Naturally.<br> A man prepared to make<br> a good many personal sacrifices,<br> willing to devote himself to the company,<br> mind and heart, body and soul.<br> If you have the right man,<br> there'd be no worry on that score.<br> Why? Why would he do it?<br> What would be his incentive?<br> You mean, outside of salary?<br> There's such a thing<br> as success, isn't there?<br> The sense of accomplishment.<br> Exactly.<br> Now, let's assume, Shaw,<br> that you're the man<br> running the Tredway Corporation<br> your way.<br> Would you be satisfied<br> to measure your life's work<br> by how much you raised the dividend?<br> Would you regard your life as a success<br> just because you managed<br> to get the dividend<br> to $3 or $4, or five or six or seven?<br> Would that be enough?<br> Is that what you want engraved<br> on your tombstone when you die?<br> The dividend record<br> of the Tredway Corporation?<br> Are you suggesting<br> that earnings aren't important?<br> I'm suggesting no such thing<br> and you know it!<br> Shaw's right when he says<br> that we have an obligation<br> to our stockholders.<br> But it's a bigger obligation<br> than raising the dividend.<br> We have an obligation<br> to keep this company alive,<br> not just this year, or next,<br> or the year after that.<br> Sometimes, you have to use your profits<br> for the growth of the company,<br> not pay them all out in dividends<br> to impress the stockholders<br> with your management record.<br> There's your waste, Shaw!<br> There's your inefficiency!<br> Stop growing, and you die!<br> Turn your back on experimentation<br> and planning for tomorrow<br> because they don't contribute<br> to dividends today<br> and you won't have a tomorrow<br> because there won't be any company.<br> Avery Bullard didn't seem to think<br> my policies were exactly<br> destroying this company.<br> No.<br> No, he didn't.<br> And he was wrong.<br> The way a lot of people<br> are wrong these days,<br> grabbing for the quick and easy,<br> the sure thing.<br> That's just a lack of faith in the future,<br> something that's in the air today,<br> the groping of a lot of men,<br> who know they've lost their faith,<br> but aren't sure what it is,<br> or how they happened to lose it.<br> Avery Bullard was one of them.<br> He'd been so busy building<br> a great production machine<br> that he finally lost sight<br> of why he was building it,<br> of why he was the man he was!<br> If he ever really knew.<br> Do you know, Mr. Walling?<br> Yes, I think I do.<br> Avery Bullard was driven by pride,<br> pride in himself,<br> the urge to do things<br> that no other man on earth could do.<br> He was the man at the top of the tower,<br> needing no one, wanting no one,<br> only himself.<br> That's what it took to satisfy his pride.<br> That was his strength.<br> That was his weakness, too.<br> Why shouldn't a man have pride<br> if he's earned it?<br> All right.<br> But why should that set him apart<br> from the people he's working with?<br> The force behind a great company<br> has to be more than the pride of one man,<br> it has to be the pride of thousands.<br> You can't make men work<br> for money alone,<br> you starve their souls when you try it.<br> And you can starve a company<br> to death the same way.<br> Avery Bullard must have known that once,<br> but he'd become a little lost<br> these last few years.<br> The company had been saved.<br> There were no more battles to win.<br> Now he had to find<br> something else to feed his pride:<br> bigger sales, more profit, something.<br> And that's when we started<br> doing things like this.<br> The K-F line.<br> Walt, are your boys proud<br> when they go out and sell this stuff<br> when they know the finish is gonna crack,<br> the veneer will split off<br> and the legs come loose?<br> Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> That's price merchandise.<br> It serves a definite purpose<br> in the profit structure of this company.<br> - We're not cheating anyone.<br> - Ourselves!<br> At that price, the customer knows<br> exactly what he's going to get.<br> This?<br> This is what Tredway has come to mean!<br> And what do you suppose the people<br> think of us when they buy it?<br> How do you suppose the men in the<br> factories feel when they make it?<br> What must they think of a management<br> that's willing to stoop<br> to selling this kind of junk<br> in order to add<br> a dime a year to the dividend?<br> Do you know there are men at Pike Street<br> who've refused to work on the K-F line?<br> Who've taken a $7.50-a-week cut<br> to get transferred to something else?<br> Well, after all,<br> that's only part of our business.<br> Eventually, we can cut down on the line.<br> We'll drop that line!<br> And we'll never again ask a man<br> to do anything that will poison his pride<br> in himself or his work.<br> We'll have a line of low-price furniture,<br> a new and different line,<br> as different from anything<br> we're making today,<br> as a modern automobile<br> is different from a covered wagon.<br> That's what you'd want, Walt, isn't it?<br> What you've always wanted?<br> Merchandise that will sell because<br> it had beauty and function and value,<br> not because the buyers like your Scotch<br> or think you're a good egg.<br> The kind of stuff that you, Jesse,<br> will be able to feel in your guts<br> when you know it's coming off<br> your production line.<br> A product that you'll be able to budget<br> to the nearest hundredth of a cent, Shaw,<br> because it will be scientifically<br> and efficiently designed.<br> And something you'll be proud<br> to have your name on, Miss Tredway.<br> We're gonna give<br> the people what they need<br> at prices they can afford to pay.<br> And as fresh needs come up,<br> we'll satisfy them, too,<br> with something new<br> and even more exciting!<br> And when we achieve that,<br> we'll really start to grow!<br> We're not gonna die, we're gonna live!<br> And it's gonna take<br> every bit of business judgment<br> and creative energy in this company<br> from the mills and the factories<br> right to the top of the Tower!<br> And we're going to do it together.<br> Every one of us.<br> Right here, at Tredway.<br> I'm with you, Don!<br> I take great pleasure<br> in nominating Mr. McDonald Walling<br> for the presidency<br> of the Tredway Corporation.<br> Second!<br> I move we make it unanimous.<br> All those in favor?<br> Miss Tredway?<br> Yes.<br> Mr. Caswell?<br> Mr. Shaw?<br> So voted.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thank you, Loren.<br> Loren?<br> About that stock...<br> - You're Mary Walling, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> - You must be very proud of him.<br> - I am.<br> - I'm a little frightened, too.<br> - Because you don't quite understand him?<br> We never do. Not completely.<br> Not men like that.<br> It will make you very lonely at times<br> when he shuts you out of his life,<br> but then he'll always come back to you.<br> And you'll know<br> how fortunate you are to...<br> To be his wife.<br> Will you tell him something for me?<br> Say thank you for saving my life.<br> Congratulations, Mary.<br> - Oh, Erica.<br> - Yes, Mr. Walling?<br> Better call a committee meeting<br> for 10:00 Monday morning.<br> We'll be appointing<br> an executive vice-president.<br> Yes, Mr. Walling.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Hey, by the way, who won today?<br> - We did.<br>
