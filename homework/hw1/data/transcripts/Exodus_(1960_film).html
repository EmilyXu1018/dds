                        The island of Cyprus, madam.<br> World famous for beauty and long, tragic history.<br> Been conquered many times.<br> Conquered by Phoenicians, Assyrians,<br> Persians, Macedonians.<br> Also conquered by Greeks, Romans,<br> Byzantines, Turks.<br> Purchased from Turkey<br> by your esteemed self, the British Empire.<br> All Cyprus most fond of the British.<br> I'm an American.<br> Fond of Americans also.<br> We Cypriots are fond of everybody.<br> Shall we go through the castle now?<br> No, I've changed my mind.<br> Then maybe the Tower of Othello<br> at the harbour of Famagusta.<br> - It'sincluded in the tour.<br> - All right.<br> What's the matter here?<br> Prison ship has arrived<br> full of Jews for the camps, madam.<br> - What camps?<br> - Detention camps out at Karaolos.<br> You see, the Jews, they charter a ship<br> from Europe to get to Palestine.<br> Then the British catch the ship<br> and send the whole bunch here.<br> The Arabs don't want them in Palestine.<br> The British don't want them here, either.<br> - But they got them.<br> - Stop!<br> Get him!<br> Maybe you can back up<br> and drive me to this address.<br> House of the British Commander.<br> Now, then.<br> - Get his feet.<br> - Right.<br> Up.<br> Mrs. Fremont?<br> The General's expecting you in the garden.<br> How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?<br> I'm very glad to see you.<br> Please sit down.<br> Found that here in the garden.<br> From the colour,<br> I'd say it belongs to the Byzantine period.<br> The Byzantines occupied Cyprus for centuries.<br> Gives one an idea how temporary<br> our claims to the world's real estate are.<br> I'm ashamed to say I really don't know<br> anything about archaeology.<br> Few people do.<br> Didn't you once publish something<br> about the Roman ruins in Cheltenham?<br> A very obscure something. How did you know?<br> Tom mentioned it in one of his letters.<br> He was very proud of your friendship.<br> As I was of his.<br> Will you have tea, or something livelier?<br> Something livelier, please.<br> - Is that ice I see?<br> - Surprised?<br> Tom got me into the habit.<br> Now I use ice in practically everything.<br> There we are.<br> May we drink to Tom?<br> Of course.<br> I'm extremely sorry circumstances<br> compelled us to bury him in the field.<br> Even sorrier I was transferred from Palestine...<br> ...before I got the chance to see you.<br> It wasn't your fault.<br> It took me almost a week to arrange passage.<br> But your letter was waiting there for me,<br> and Tom's things.<br> I really shouldn't have let him go with us.<br> It was only a border affair.<br> One of the Jewish undergrounds<br> had blown up half a dozen bridges.<br> It really wasn't important enough<br> to lose one's life for.<br> Is anything?<br> In my opinion, yes.<br> I've known many soldiers, Mrs. Fremont,<br> and war correspondents...<br> ...and news photographers,<br> such as your husband.<br> But I think perhaps Tom<br> was the bravest man I've ever met.<br> We have a saying in Indiana:<br> "The braver the bird, the fatter the cat. "<br> Perhaps.<br> Do you recognize this photograph, General?<br> Of course. It was his last.<br> Do you remember how Tom got that shot?<br> We were together.<br> I must confess, my eyes weren't on him<br> when he snapped the shutter.<br> The aircraft came in low.<br> We were both in the truck.<br> I jumped down on one side to take cover,<br> and Tom jumped down on the other side.<br> Tom couldn't have taken cover<br> and photographed the plane as he did.<br> I dare say you're right.<br> He had a strong sense of duty.<br> He also had a strong sense of death.<br> I felt I had to confirm what I suspected<br> about the last photograph.<br> I'm very grateful to you.<br> That's over a year ago.<br> How have you been occupying yourself?<br> - After I lost the child I was-<br> - The child?<br> Didn't Tom tell you we had a child on the way?<br> Men like Tom are often quite reticent<br> about things that are nearest to their hearts.<br> I understand.<br> It was quite late in my pregnancy<br> when Tom was killed.<br> Apparently the Palestine trip was too much.<br> I lost the baby in the hospital at Jerusalem.<br> And then I went back<br> to my old profession of nursing.<br> I've just completed my tour of duty<br> with the US Public Health Service in Greece.<br> Very good. What are your plans for the future?<br> I haven't quite decided yet.<br> I may travel a while before I go home.<br> I have passage booked on a freighter<br> that sails next week to Istanbul.<br> From there I may go to Lydia.<br> I've always wanted to see the Vale of Kashmir.<br> It's probably the most beautiful spot on earth.<br> Mrs. Fremont, may I introduce Maj. Caldwell?<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> - Have a drink.<br> - Thank you. I'd love one.<br> - How did your disembarkation go?<br> - Smoothly.<br> We're really up to our neck in Jews, sir.<br> Karaolos bursting at the seams<br> and more to come.<br> I still say we should send them back<br> where they came from.<br> Two loads were shipped out of Haifa<br> bound for Hamburg.<br> I don't see why we can't do the same thing.<br> I shouldn't like to have a hand<br> in sending a Jew back to Germany.<br> Squeeze them in as best as you can.<br> They're squeezed in.<br> Short of bed space, supplies...<br> ...short of nurses, short of temper,<br> short of everything.<br> Mrs. Fremont's a nurse.<br> Why don't you lend a hand at Karaolos?<br> No, General. I'm afraid I couldn't.<br> I've really been quite tired lately.<br> And I don't know anything about them.<br> About the Jews?<br> I feel strange among them.<br> In what way?<br> Now that you mention it, I can't think.<br> It's just a feeling I get.<br> - Will you have another drink?<br> - Thank you, no. I really must leave.<br> I'm touring the island<br> and my guide is very firm with me.<br> - loll take you to your car.<br> - Thank you for the drink and the talk.<br> Drive by Karaolos on your tour.<br> Ring me if there's anything I can do<br> to make your stay more comfortable.<br> I will.<br> I'm very fond of the old man. One of the best.<br> Makes it all the more difficult<br> to explain his little quirk.<br> Quirk?<br> About the Jews.<br> You caught it all right. I was watching.<br> Almost makes one believe the story<br> one hears now and then.<br> Probably nonsense, but still...<br> What story?<br> That if you gave a good shake to his family tree,<br> you'd find a Jew up there.<br> Please tell Gen. Sutherland<br> I've changed my mind.<br> loll be happy to work at Karaolos for a few days.<br> - Goodbye, Major.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Do you need any help?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Good night, then.<br> - Good night, and thanks for stopping.<br> Ari! Ari Ben Canaan!<br> - Reuben. How are you?<br> - Fine.<br> The car's up there.<br> Good. We'll go directly to Mandria.<br> We can't, Ari.<br> He's on the other side of the island.<br> - He won't be back until tomorrow.<br> - He should be on this side of the island.<br> British checkpoint, Jewish checkpoint.<br> We don't allow our military personnel<br> in the camp area...<br> ...unless something extraordinary occurs.<br> We handle the outside. The inside's up to them.<br> - Lieutenant, this is Katherine Fremont.<br> - How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?<br> American. Authority Gen. Sutherland.<br> Pass her at all times.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> These Zionist organizations,<br> or whatever they call them...<br> ...send their own people over from Palestine<br> to administer these camps.<br> Jews seem to respond better to their own kind.<br> Perhaps we all do.<br> We even give them the privilege<br> of approving all Gentile personnel.<br> - I hope you don't mind.<br> - Not at all.<br> - Good morning, Ben Ami.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> This is Mrs. Fremont,<br> an American friend of Gen. Sutherland.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Ben Ami is one of the Palestinians<br> who run this camp.<br> Mrs. Fremont has a few days to while away<br> in Cyprus, and being an experienced nurse...<br> ...the general thought you may find<br> her assistance valuable.<br> We find all assistance of value, Maj. Caldwell.<br> - Would you show him your passport?<br> - Of course.<br> Any friend of Gen. Sutherland's<br> is always welcome.<br> Convey my respects to the general,<br> and thank him for us.<br> Of course. Goodbye. Good luck.<br> - Call us if you need us.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Would you care to come with me?<br> - Surely.<br> Yesterday's shipload<br> will double our hospital capacity.<br> It's very good of you to help us get organized.<br> - Leave me alone.<br> - You're burning up with fever.<br> If you don't let us clean out the infection<br> you'll die, that's all.<br> After coming so far,<br> you'll die without ever having seen Eretz Israel.<br> loll see Palestine before you. Now leave me alone.<br> This woman is trying to help you.<br> - Do as she says.<br> - Who are you?<br> He's the Palestinian commander, that's who.<br> A Jewish policeman, working for them.<br> I know your kind from Auschwitz.<br> - You can't tell me what to do.<br> - We'll see.<br> - loll hold him.<br> - Just try.<br> Dov! If you don't let them help you, you'll die.<br> I want to die.<br> You don't know what you're saying.<br> loll take them off myself. It won't hurt.<br> Keep away from me, all of you.<br> Excuse me.<br> I think I can talk to him better if we're alone.<br> We came on the Star of David together,<br> and I know him. He's just shy.<br> Don't get too close to the glass.<br> Dov Landau, you ought to be<br> ashamed of yourself. Put that down.<br> I won't.<br> That hurt.<br> Not half as bad as it will hurt.<br> loll teach you. loll beat you all over.<br> Well? Do you let them take care of you or not?<br> Not them. But if you want to do it, well, all right.<br> Thank you.<br> And don't you ever spit on me again.<br> Just remember.<br> - It's all right, loll do it.<br> - How did you change his mind?<br> Just patience and kindness.<br> Yetta will show you around.<br> Don't hesitate to call on me if I can help.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, this is pavilion number two.<br> Excuse me.<br> This boy has a skin infection called impetigo.<br> - He needs sulfathiazole on those scabs.<br> - If the camp has no such drug?<br> Leave him alone.<br> That will spread it all over his body.<br> - You think so?<br> - I know it. It's terribly contagious.<br> My dear, it's this way.<br> If you have no sulfathiazole...<br> ...and no ammoniated mercury ointment...<br> ...which was the earlier pharmacology,<br> you soften the scab with soap and water...<br> ...and gently remove it like this, you see?<br> Then expose the lesion<br> for five minutes to the sun.<br> That's also a cure.<br> - You're a doctor.<br> - By coincidence.<br> It was stupid of me to interfere.<br> I'm a nurse. loll be working here for a while.<br> Please forgive me.<br> Dr. Odenheim, it's time for you to rest.<br> You've been up all night. I know how to do this.<br> - He taught me on the ship.<br> - Thank you, child of light.<br> loll find you something to wear over your dress,<br> a gown or an apron.<br> Thank you.<br> My name is Katherine Fremont. I'm a nurse.<br> - You can call me Kitty.<br> - My name's Karen Hansen.<br> Hansen?<br> - Then your mother was Jewish?<br> - Yes, and my father.<br> - Reuben.<br> - Shalom, Ari.<br> - David, how are you?<br> - Shalom, Ari.<br> - Mr. Mandria, this is Ari Ben Canaan.<br> - Welcome.<br> Very pleased to meet you.<br> We've heard good things about you in Palestine.<br> - Rumours. But I like them.<br> - So do we.<br> Please sit down.<br> - Cigar?<br> - No, thanks.<br> Well, David,<br> how many people have you got by now...<br> ...in that barbed wire jungle of yours?<br> Over 30,000.<br> And they're building for 30,000 more<br> on the other side of the island.<br> How many arrived yesterday<br> on the Star of David?<br> Six hundred and eleven.<br> We're going to take the same 611 off the island<br> and land them in Palestine.<br> - Six hundred and eleven?<br> - He thinks he's Moses.<br> We haven't been able to break<br> more than 10 or 15 at a time out of Karaolos.<br> This will be a new experience.<br> One thing more. There's a time limit.<br> Today is Tuesday.<br> We'll stage the break next Monday.<br> - Next Monday?<br> - Why not tomorrow?<br> Ari, we cannot do it.<br> The United Nations<br> will vote on the Palestine issue...<br> ...before the end of this session.<br> Between now and then<br> we have to show the world...<br> ...thousands of homeless European Jews...<br> ...are not going to accept any solution<br> that bars them from Palestine.<br> A mass escape of the very same people<br> who arrived on the Star of David...<br> ...is worth more than a million speeches.<br> But this isn't the Red Sea, Ari.<br> It's the Mediterranean.<br> Right. Smite these waters as you will,<br> they do not part.<br> That's why you'll have to get us a ship.<br> I want a legitimate freighter...<br> ...with legal registry and real cargo<br> we can unload here in Cyprus.<br> A ship for six...<br> That's a wonderful idea.<br> Brilliant.<br> But the expense will be brilliant also.<br> Not too brilliant.<br> You know, our treasury is based on donations,<br> and right now we're rather low.<br> - Well, can you deliver or not?<br> - loll do my best.<br> We Cypriots are with you.<br> For the Jews, Mandria will do everything.<br> The Jews have paid you well for your efforts,<br> Mr. Mandria.<br> - Ari, you've got to understand-<br> - No, Reuben. I say it.<br> Do you believe that I, Plato Mandria,<br> would do this for money?<br> Do you think I'd risk<br> I tell you, it has cost me over 5,000<br> since I work with the Haganah.<br> You owe him an apology, Ari.<br> I do apologize, Mr. Mandria.<br> It was a stupid remark.<br> Not necessary.<br> If I apologize each time I get stupid,<br> I'd spend a lifetime on my knees.<br> - Also, we'll need 14 lorries.<br> -14, he says. Why not 1,400?<br> The British have requisitioned every car,<br> truck and lorry on this island.<br> Haganah makes mistakes just like anybody else.<br> This is one of them.<br> David, I want to hear every objection,<br> every criticism, every suggestion, but only once.<br> - Now the boat project is under way, right?<br> - Almost accomplished.<br> I will send a telegram to a shipbroker in Athens.<br> - Don't the British monitor telegrams?<br> - Naturally.<br> But some of the monitors are Cypriots.<br> They'd like the Britons in Britain,<br> the Jews in Palestine...<br> ...and the Cypriots in Cyprus.<br> Not, mind you, that I'm anti-British.<br> If I must have a master,<br> the British are far the best.<br> But the problem, my dear friend, is,<br> why have a master at all?<br> Shouldn't have hurt him, Ari. He's a real friend.<br> Maybe, but don't let the Mandrias fool you.<br> They work for us and say how terrible it was...<br> ...that 6,000,000 Jews went into the oven.<br> But when the showdown comes,<br> we always stand alone.<br> Mandria will sell us out like all the others.<br> We have no friends, except ourselves.<br> Remember that.<br> You're wrong,<br> but you'll have to learn that for yourself.<br> Now tell me, how is Jordana?<br> I think she's in love.<br> You've had this letter since last night-<br> I forgot about it.<br> He's in love with her, so he thinks everyone is.<br> He's right.<br> She mention me in there?<br> Thank you.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - None for me.<br> How did you know I postponed my departure?<br> Central Intelligence has a great talent<br> for spying on the innocent.<br> It'll interest them to learn<br> that I have a plot under way.<br> Good. Can you tell me about it?<br> There's a child at the camp<br> I'd like to take out for a holiday.<br> Just for luncheon,<br> and perhaps to buy her some clothes.<br> Then I take it<br> some of the strangeness has worn off?<br> I know it was foolish to say that.<br> But I can't help it. I do feel strange among them.<br> Except for this girl.<br> Somehow she's entirely different.<br> Her point of view, the way she works...<br> ...she acts, feels and speaks<br> almost exactly like an American.<br> I can think of no higher praise.<br> You're laughing at me, and I deserve it.<br> I'm not laughing. I'm simply glad it worked.<br> - What?<br> - I wanted you to get interested...<br> ...in something<br> beside your own troubles, and you did.<br> It's interesting that you saw it so fast.<br> - Of course, you were absolutely right.<br> - I'm glad you weren't offended.<br> I shouldn't like you to become a woman...<br> ...who drifts through life, "fair to no purpose...<br> "... artful to no end,<br> young without lovers, old without a friend. "<br> Do you have a solution?<br> If I were 20 years younger<br> I'd offer myself as a solution.<br> The Vale of Kashmir is no good<br> unless you share it with someone.<br> Places don't mean anything.<br> Only people are important.<br> Fill your life with people.<br> Let Tom return to the grave where he belongs.<br> Fred!<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - There's a child out at Karaolos...<br> ...Mrs. Fremont would like released for a day.<br> What's her name?<br> Karen Hansen.<br> - See to it for me, will you?<br> - Very well, sir.<br> - Isn't it a little irregular?<br> - Extremely.<br> That's why I want your signature on the pass<br> instead of my own.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Isn't she a beauty?<br> You must have towed it across.<br> All right, she's no beauty,<br> but her heart is solid oak. You'll see.<br> Ari!<br> Hank, how are you?<br> Hank Schlosberg from Cincinnati.<br> He's run more ships through the blockade<br> than anyone.<br> This is Mr. Mandria, who arranged for this tub.<br> - Not a bad ship.<br> - Not a good one, Mr. Mandria.<br> For the money we pay,<br> every ship cannot be the Queen Mary.<br> Can this abortion make it to Palestine?<br> On my mother's honour, she has made 300 trips...<br> ...from Cyprus to Turkey under her last owner.<br> That's just the trouble.<br> We can hold her together for one more round.<br> I want a loudspeaker system aboard.<br> Get me a power unit<br> and six Almec-Thorston speakers.<br> There is no such equipment for sale in Cyprus.<br> If you can't buy it, steal it.<br> Stock it with provisions for five days.<br> - For a two-day trip?<br> - Five days.<br> All prepared foods, either canned or packaged.<br> The most expensive, naturally.<br> - Have you got my jeep yet?<br> - I told you, it's impossible.<br> A jeep is out of the question, absolutely.<br> - Need someone to overhaul the engine tank?<br> - No, my gang can take care of that.<br> - Mr. Mandria?<br> - Yes?<br> What about that jeep there?<br> That belongs to His Beatitude...<br> ...the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Cyprus.<br> Steal it. Paint it. Hide it till I'm ready for it.<br> The water's wonderful.<br> May I have another swim before my steak?<br> Just once more,<br> because we're due back at the camp.<br> - Is that the girl?<br> - Yes.<br> Swims just like an American.<br> - loll buy you a drink if you'll forget that joke.<br> - I just had one.<br> She is nice.<br> Would it be too difficult to arrange<br> for me to take her back to America?<br> Not from our end.<br> We'd be glad to let them all go.<br> So long as they don't end up in Palestine.<br> Let me know when you've decided.<br> loll get Maj. Caldwell to arrange it for you.<br> Thank you.<br> Karen.<br> Coming.<br> Would you like to go to America?<br> Of course. Everybody likes to go to America.<br> Then you will go.<br> loll cancel the rest of my trip,<br> and loll take you with me.<br> And you can go to school there,<br> and later on to the university.<br> And if you like it, and want to,<br> you can become an American citizen.<br> You mean, go right away?<br> Perhaps. In the next week or two.<br> Meanwhile, I may be able to get you out of camp.<br> loll speak to the general tonight.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> You do want to go, don't you?<br> Yes, but I mean...<br> I must think about it a little.<br> - What is there to think about?<br> - I don't know.<br> But it's so important, and I need a little time.<br> You know, to think.<br> Take all the time you wish.<br> - Kitty?<br> - Yes?<br> - Don't be mad at me.<br> - Of course not.<br> It's getting late. You better finish your steak.<br> Fine thing, what you want to do for Karen.<br> She told you?<br> She is worried about her father.<br> I didn't know that her father was alive.<br> When Karen was six,<br> he smuggled her out of Germany to Denmark.<br> After the war she went back to find her parents.<br> The Jewish Agency had records of the dead.<br> She found her mother on the Dachau list...<br> ...together with her two younger brothers.<br> About the father there was nothing,<br> so naturally she hopes he is still alive.<br> Maybe in Palestine.<br> As a matter of fact, there is such a possibility.<br> He was a very important scientist.<br> The Nazis could have spared his life...<br> ...in order to use his brain.<br> But of course, who knows?<br> It's curious<br> that she didn't mention her father to me.<br> You must understand something<br> about these children.<br> Their past is scarred. They're ashamed of it.<br> To have a parent who has been persecuted,<br> or killed in a concentration camp...<br> ...is a reproach to them.<br> They feel guilty for having survived.<br> So they pretend the bad things never happened.<br> To take such a child is a great responsibility...<br> - ... even a sacrifice.<br> - It's no sacrifice.<br> I'm alone. The insurance I got<br> after my husband's death is more than enough.<br> I didn't mean financial sacrifice,<br> although it's a good thing to have money.<br> No, what I meant was,<br> you will have to make a sacrifice of yourself.<br> These children who have lost everything...<br> ...spend their lives searching for new parents.<br> Their need reaches out to your heart<br> as naturally as a flower turns to the sun.<br> And they trap you.<br> Because they've been so long without love,<br> they demand all the love you have.<br> Karen will drain you of love. She'll exhaust you.<br> That's exactly what I need.<br> I'd like to go with you, Kitty.<br> If you still want me.<br> - Morning.<br> - Morning.<br> - Bowen, 23rd GT Company.<br> - What can I do for you, sir?<br> Afraid loll to have to draw rather heavily on you.<br> - Please have a chair.<br> - Thank you.<br> This does draw us down a bit.<br> Excuse me a moment.<br> - Operator.<br> - CO, please.<br> Won't take a minute.<br> I hope not. As you can see, I'm in a hurry.<br> - CO speaking.<br> - Hall here, sir.<br> I've an order at transport pool, sir, for 14 lorries...<br> ...4 motorcycles, 18 drivers and 18 guards.<br> Estimated use four hours, sir.<br> - What's this for?<br> - Transport from Karaolos, sir.<br> - Who is requesting this?<br> - Capt. Bowen.<br> - What authority?<br> - Sir Cecil Bradshaw, of the Colonial office.<br> - Yes.<br> - Countersigned Lt. Gen. Sutherland.<br> - Well, allocate it then.<br> - Yes, of course, sir.<br> - What's the query?<br> - I thought you might want...<br> ...to draw extra transport from headquarters.<br> - Don't babble on, man. Give it to him.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And get on with it.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Smithers. Take this and get it filled at once.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - We'll have you taken care of in a jiff.<br> Can I order tea for you?<br> Rather prefer a gin and tonic, if you don't mind.<br> - Bowen, 23rd transport company.<br> - Lt. Arnold, sir.<br> I want to see the Palestinian camp commander.<br> Right this way, sir.<br> This is the Palestinian commander,<br> David Ben Ami.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> We are relocating all the internees<br> from the Star of David.<br> Here are your orders.<br> Where are you taking these people?<br> Their destination is not included<br> in your orders, Mr...<br> - Ben Ami.<br> - Yes. Thank you.<br> These people have not recovered<br> from their last journey.<br> I cannot permit them to travel again so soon,<br> just because of a piece of paper.<br> Piece of paper?<br> - This seems perfectly clear to me.<br> - Sir, some of these people are sick.<br> You will turn the internees over at once.<br> I'm sorry. I just cannot accept that responsibility.<br> loll take the responsibility.<br> - There, does that satisfy you?<br> - Of course, I don't approve, but...<br> ...I guess it makes the record perfect.<br> Would you order him<br> to place all his Palestinian...<br> ...administrative personnel at my disposal<br> while loading?<br> - Did you hear?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You can call on me<br> if you run into any trouble, sir.<br> Thanks, old chap.<br> Well, let's get about it.<br> Attention.<br> All passengers from the Star of David,<br> listen carefully.<br> We have received orders<br> to evacuate you immediately.<br> I repeat. All those who arrived<br> on the Star of David...<br> ...are to be evacuated at once.<br> Please prepare to board the British lorries<br> now passing through the camp.<br> Report at once<br> to your nearest Palestinian guard point.<br> What does this mean? HMJFC?<br> His Majesty's Jewish Forces on Cyprus,<br> what else?<br> - What's going on?<br> - Military police.<br> They're blocking the intersection<br> for through traffic.<br> I don't understand.<br> Go and find the commanding officer, will you?<br> I'd better look into this myself.<br> Excuse me, Mrs. Fremont.<br> Stay here.<br> - Sergeant, clear the way for my car.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm afraid this is most unusual.<br> We've had no warning.<br> loll check with headquarters.<br> These orders are perfectly clear.<br> Signed by the Colonial Office<br> and countersigned by Gen. Sutherland.<br> What's this? The whole area's tied up.<br> - Who's in charge?<br> - O'Hara.<br> Permit me. Bowen, 23rd GT Company.<br> Special detail, orders of Gen. Sutherland.<br> Here are the papers, sir.<br> Well, Bowen, I see you're going to be<br> getting rid of some Jews for us?<br> - Yes, sir. Shipping them back to Hamburg.<br> - That's where they belong.<br> It's a German matter. Let the Germans handle it.<br> Apparently the general's had second thoughts.<br> Why do you question these orders?<br> I didn't question.<br> I just wanted to check with headquarters.<br> Countersigning is not the responsibility<br> of junior officers.<br> The acceptance of responsibility...<br> ...is what makes senior officers out of juniors.<br> - Let them through.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Should have started this policy two years ago.<br> I don't care about the Jews one way or the other.<br> - But they are troublemakers.<br> - No question about it, sir.<br> Get two of them together, you've got a debate...<br> ...and three, a revolution.<br> Yes. And half of them are Communists anyway.<br> Yes, and the other half pawnbrokers.<br> They look funny, too. I can spot one a mile away.<br> Would you mind looking into my eye?<br> It feels like a cinder.<br> Certainly.<br> You know, a lot of them<br> try to hide under Gentile names.<br> But one look at that face, and you just know.<br> With a little experience, you can smell them out.<br> - I'm sorry, I can't find a thing.<br> - Must've been my imagination. Thanks.<br> Maj. Caldwell, are they taking everybody<br> who was on the Star of David?<br> - Yes, ma'am, we are.<br> - Then Karen's on one of those trucks.<br> Karen?<br> Karen Hansen.<br> I have Gen. Sutherland's permission<br> to take her to America.<br> - We were on our way to pick up the girl.<br> - How old is she?<br> Fourteen. She was assigned to the hospital.<br> Yes, it seems to me...<br> Is that the girl that the...<br> ...forgot his name, the camp commander,<br> was talking about?<br> David Ben Ami? Yes.<br> He knew she was supposed go with me.<br> I remember. He told me<br> the general had made arrangements for her...<br> ...so I left her behind, on my own responsibility.<br> - Very good, Bowen.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> I appreciate your help.<br> Convey my respects to the general.<br> That I will.<br> - Bit of a Jew himself, you know.<br> - Not really?<br> Good luck, sir.<br> Remember, I've been in Palestine.<br> I know what kind of life she'll live, if she lives.<br> I grant you that.<br> Besides, she must have been forced,<br> otherwise she would've left a note.<br> We'll get her back for you, one way or another.<br> With her consent, of course.<br> Who was in charge of this evacuation?<br> Chap named Bowen, sir. Capt. Bowen.<br> - What did he look like?<br> - Look like?<br> A well set up sort of chap.<br> Proper bearing, decent decorations.<br> Spoke like any of us.<br> - From what command?<br> -23rd GT Company, sir.<br> - Is anything irregular?<br> - Could be.<br> We don't list a 23rd GT Company on Cyprus.<br> You should have known that.<br> Yes, I should.<br> - Perhaps I made an error.<br> - It's human.<br> Who issued Capt. Bowen's orders?<br> They originated with Bradshaw<br> of the Colonial Office.<br> And, of course, you signed them.<br> - You examined the signatures?<br> - Well, naturally, and I countersigned.<br> I signed no such order.<br> Neither have I seen such an order<br> from the Colonial Office.<br> Well, those signatures must've been forged?<br> We can't exclude the possibility.<br> With one exception, of course.<br> - Your signature was genuine, wasn't it?<br> - Someone had to take responsibility, sir.<br> And you took it. Now you've got it.<br> What do you propose to do with it?<br> That boat...<br> That Olympia...<br> She's not going to Hamburg.<br> She's probably heading for Palestine.<br> Undoubtedly.<br> Telephone control, tell them to block the harbour.<br> Take a look at the situation yourself.<br> Very well, sir.<br> Mrs. Fremont. Sir.<br> Let me have the microphone.<br> Attention, Olympia. Attention, out there.<br> This is Maj. Caldwell speaking.<br> Attention, Olympia.<br> You have no chance to escape.<br> The destroyer Zebra is moving into position<br> to block the harbour entrance.<br> Return to dock.<br> Otherwise we will board you.<br> We're bound for Palestine<br> with an American captain and crew...<br> ...and a passenger manifest of 611 persons.<br> We're carrying 200 pounds of dynamite<br> in the engine room with fuses attached.<br> You let one British soldier step aboard<br> this ship and we'll blow her up.<br> Have you heard me, Major?<br> Message received.<br> Where would they find 200 pounds of dynamite?<br> - Get me Gen. Sutherland.<br> - Operator.<br> - Connect me to Gen. Sutherland.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> In an ammunition dump, you blithering idiot.<br> - Sutherland here.<br> - Caldwell here, sir.<br> The Olympia threatens to blow herself<br> out of the water, sir, if we board her.<br> I'm convinced it's a bluff, of course.<br> Boarding party en route, sir.<br> Call your boarding party back.<br> Signal the Olympia.<br> I'm asking London for instructions.<br> If she stays where she is, no one will molest her.<br> They've threatened to dynamite<br> the Olympia if we board her.<br> Do you think they mean it?<br> Nearly two years ago, a Haganah ship<br> which we were detaining in the port of Haifa...<br> ...did blow herself up. 236 refugees died.<br> General, I simply must get Karen off the ship.<br> Would you care to go on board the Olympia...<br> ...and learn from the child<br> exactly what happened?<br> - Will they let me?<br> - loll try and arrange it.<br> If I succeed, you can do me a favour in return.<br> loll do anything.<br> If force, or coercion of any kind,<br> was used to get that child on board the ship...<br> ...you must promise me to tell the entire story...<br> ...at a press conference which I shall arrange.<br> - Do you agree?<br> - loll be glad to.<br> Reuben?<br> Send this every 10 minutes,<br> and keep on sending it.<br> - Could we interrupt, please?<br> - Yes.<br> This is Dr. de Vries. We elevated ourselves<br> into a medical committee.<br> Good.<br> It's our opinion the sanitary arrangements<br> on this ship are hopelessly inadequate.<br> Unless we make<br> some additional bathing and toilet facilities...<br> ...we'll have a serious health problem.<br> All right, we'll try to take care of it.<br> There he is. This is Mrs. Fremont,<br> from Gen. Sutherland.<br> - How do you do? Hank?<br> - Yes.<br> We have enough scrap lumber<br> to build privies on deck?<br> I guess so.<br> Ten-holers. Knock some showers together, too.<br> Okay.<br> - Anything else?<br> - Not for the present, thank you.<br> This one to Haifa.<br> You wanted to see me?<br> Yes, Captain.<br> "Yes, Captain. " His Majesty's Jewish Brigade.<br> North Africa, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.<br> The decorations are real.<br> Is that what Sutherland sent you to find out?<br> You lied to me about the girl.<br> She's not at the camp, she's on this ship.<br> And you forced her to come aboard.<br> - We don't force anybody. Tel Aviv yet?<br> - No.<br> Go on.<br> You're not listening.<br> I heard every word you said.<br> I lied to you about the girl. What else?<br> I'm taking her off this death trap.<br> Don't tell me what you'll do on this ship.<br> You'll do exactly what I tell you.<br> - Tel Aviv beginning to send.<br> - Fine.<br> How do you know the girl wants to get off?<br> I am trying to save a Jewish child.<br> Can't you understand that?<br> Don't you have any respect for human life?<br> Don't expect me to get hysterical<br> over one Jewish child...<br> ...and don't you get hysterical, either.<br> You're late, lady. You're 10 years late.<br> Almost 2,000,000 Jewish children,<br> butchered like animals...<br> ...because nobody wanted them.<br> No country would have them.<br> Not your country or any other.<br> And nobody wants the ones who survived.<br> Jewish flesh is cheap, lady.<br> It's cheaper than beef.<br> It is cheaper, even, than herring.<br> You and your respect...<br> Tel Aviv complete now.<br> If you can find the girl, if she wants to go,<br> take her. Take a dozen if you want to.<br> Kitty!<br> It happened so fast,<br> I couldn't even leave you a note.<br> I had to go, Kitty, to find my father.<br> When you asked me to go to America,<br> I didn't know, and...<br> Kitty, we're going to Palestine.<br> Karen, you don't know what it's like in Palestine.<br> And the British won't let you go, anyhow.<br> They'll have to, Kitty. They'll just have to.<br> Because we're not going back to Karaolos,<br> not ever.<br> Then let me take you to Palestine.<br> I can find a way.<br> - The man in charge, Mr...<br> - Ben Canaan?<br> Yes.<br> If you want to come with me,<br> you have his permission.<br> I couldn't leave now, Kitty.<br> I don't know how to explain it<br> to someone like you.<br> But we all came here together,<br> and now we're trying to do something.<br> And I must stay here, Kitty.<br> Gen. Sutherland calling the Olympia.<br> This is the Exodus. Come in, General.<br> I have received instructions<br> from the Colonial Office in London.<br> No attempt will be made to board the Olympia...<br> ...but the harbour will remain blocked.<br> You may return to Karaolos whenever you wish.<br> If you choose to remain in the ship...<br> ...provisions and medical supplies<br> will be sent to you as you need them.<br> Message completed.<br> Not even now?<br> Kitty...<br> ...I couldn't.<br> It's like leaving your family when things are bad.<br> I know.<br> If you want anything, let me know.<br> Yes. Gen. Sutherland's your friend.<br> Tell him to let us go to Palestine.<br> They're just going to turn this ship<br> into another concentration camp.<br> Go back? Nonsense.<br> Did we escape for just ourselves alone? No.<br> We've done it for hundreds of thousands<br> of Jews all over Europe...<br> ...who couldn't get out.<br> Also it makes news. World news.<br> I want your attention for a minute.<br> Now you all heard Gen. Sutherland<br> on the loudspeaker.<br> You must now make a decision.<br> You can go back to Karaolos...<br> The only way to go back to Karaolos<br> is by crawling!<br> ...or you can stay aboard this ship.<br> Who are you making the propaganda for?<br> Them or us?<br> Quiet, please. There's another possibility.<br> You were picked by Haganah for this ship...<br> ...so that your escape to Palestine<br> would have some meaning to the world.<br> If you still want it to have some meaning...<br> ...if you want to finish what we began,<br> you can go on a hunger strike.<br> Now you're beginning to make a little sense!<br> We shall tell to the British,<br> "We spit on your food. "<br> And the little food we've got here,<br> we shall throw overboard.<br> We are going to Palestine,<br> or we're going to die right here.<br> Listen, please.<br> Now just stop and think for a minute.<br> To go on a hunger strike<br> is a very serious business...<br> ...because once you strike...<br> ...it can only end when you have won<br> or when you are dead.<br> What is so unusual about the Jews dying?<br> Is that anything new?<br> I stay right here.<br> There is no excuse for us to go on living...<br> ...unless we start fighting right now.<br> So that every Jew on the face of the earth...<br> ...can begin to start feeling<br> like a human being again.<br> You heard what I said.<br> Fight, not beg!<br> Fight!<br> Wait a minute.<br> Everybody aboard this ship...<br> ...agreed to accept Haganah discipline.<br> I am now giving an order.<br> We will sit down...<br> ...and we will maintain silence for 20 minutes.<br> Each one of us will listen to his own heart...<br> ...and to his brain, too.<br> And then we will vote.<br> We will now maintain silence.<br> I saw the people on that ship.<br> They're not dangerous.<br> They're just poor, miserable people.<br> Why can't you let them go?<br> You must understand that we British<br> have shown, throughout our history...<br> ...an extraordinary talent<br> for troublesome commitments.<br> Palestine is a British mandate imposed upon us...<br> ...by the League of Nations...<br> ...which makes us responsible<br> for keeping peace in the area.<br> The Arabs simply won't keep the peace<br> if we allow further Jewish immigration.<br> I don't know much about the mandate.<br> But I do know the Jews<br> were promised a homeland in Palestine.<br> During the First World War,<br> Britain needed and accepted Jewish support...<br> ...from all over the world.<br> In return...<br> ...the Balfour Declaration of 1917<br> made such a promise.<br> That promise was reconfirmed<br> during World War ll.<br> This chap Ben Canaan probably wasn't lying<br> when he said he fought with us.<br> Thousands of Palestinians did.<br> How can you promise something<br> and then not deliver it?<br> England was fighting for her life in 1917.<br> Nations are very like people<br> in such circumstances.<br> They make promises<br> they're not immediately able to fulfil.<br> During that same crisis,<br> we made the Arabs certain assurances.<br> Hence, they have their claims, too.<br> The Arabs are fanatics<br> on the subject of Jewish immigration.<br> Just now, we need their goodwill.<br> - How is it ever going to end?<br> - I don't know.<br> The whole question now<br> is before the United Nations.<br> I hope they solve it.<br> The sooner I stop operating detention camps,<br> the happier loll be.<br> That goes for every British officer<br> and soldier I know.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes?<br> The devil.<br> Of course.<br> Send a boat alongside at once.<br> loll join you in 10 minutes.<br> They want to send 23 people back to Karaolos.<br> The rest have declared a hunger strike.<br> - Can I drop you at your hotel?<br> - Of course.<br> ...a few news bulletins, and an announcement.<br> The evacuation of 2,000 British women<br> and children from Palestine...<br> ...was ordered today by the High Commissioner.<br> The United Nations Commission on Palestine<br> still has not submitted its report.<br> The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem...<br> ...who sat out the war as Hitler's guest in Berlin...<br> ...has met in Aley, Lebanon,<br> with representatives of the Arab nations...<br> ...to coordinate action against Palestinian Jews...<br> ...in the event Partition is granted.<br> The UN Commission on Palestine<br> has arrived at Flushing Meadows...<br> ...and is now preparing its final<br> recommendation for the assembly.<br> News of the hunger strike aboard the Exodus...<br> ...received front-page treatment<br> this morning throughout the world.<br> The British embassy in Washington<br> is already being picketed.<br> Now Dr. Odenheim has something to say to you<br> for the medical committee.<br> It is very important<br> that we save our supply of fresh water.<br> So we must ration it. Every four hours, one cup.<br> On the other hand,<br> everyone must wash his body daily.<br> This will be done with seawater.<br> Your platoon leader will call<br> when your turn comes.<br> It is advised to conserve your energy.<br> So all necessary physical work<br> should be divided...<br> ...among as many people as possible.<br> If at any time you should feel light-headed<br> or dizzy, do not be frightened.<br> It is, in no respect, serious.<br> Just sit down<br> and lower your head between your knees.<br> All of us, of course, feel stomach pangs.<br> - They are uncomfortable, but not dangerous.<br> - That's right.<br> Final point...<br> ...people can live a long time without food,<br> a very long time.<br> Attention, everybody.<br> Here is the news,<br> and some of it, I'm sorry to say, not good.<br> Dov Gruner and three other leaders<br> of the Irgun in Palestine...<br> ...were hanged today in Acre prison.<br> The United Nations Commission<br> on Palestine is still delaying...<br> ...its recommendations to the General Assembly.<br> Winston Churchill has called on<br> the Labour government to end what he calls...<br> "... this squalid war against the Jews,"<br> with all possible speed.<br> -500 Americans picketed...<br> - Your water, gentlemen.<br> ...UN headquarters in Flushing Meadows,<br> demanded release-<br> Your platoon's turn to bathe, Mr. Lakavitch.<br> Your turn to bathe.<br> Mr. Smolikov, will you please do me a favour?<br> Refresh yourself with my bath,<br> and then, little bit later, loll take yours.<br> - All right.<br> - Thank you.<br> Sorry, Mr. Lakavitch. You know the rules.<br> - Can't you see the position?<br> - No exceptions.<br> I think you carry this bathing too far.<br> - No exceptions, Mr. Lakavitch.<br> - Fanatics!<br> ...establishment of a Jewish state<br> in the Holy Land.<br> Thirteen leaders of our<br> National Committee in Tel Aviv...<br> ...have begun a hunger strike<br> in sympathy with the Exodus.<br> When more news comes in, loll report it.<br> That's all.<br> Have you time for me, Ari?<br> Always, Dr. Odenheim. What can I do?<br> We made a mistake...<br> ...a bad mistake in letting the children<br> be a part of this.<br> A child's body grows every hour.<br> They need food more than adults.<br> Their blood requires more sugar.<br> What should we do about it?<br> When a mistake is made, you admit it...<br> ...you analyse it, and you correct it.<br> Doctor, don't you feel well?<br> Who cares if an old man feels well?<br> Major!<br> - Who the devil are you?<br> - Jorgenson, of the UP.<br> - Thanks, Major.<br> - All right.<br> What is this?<br> - Information, sir.<br> - Information for whom?<br> For the tourists, of course.<br> One of our many special services.<br> And I suppose these are tourists?<br> No, sir. These people are contributors.<br> We are collecting donations for the Red Cross.<br> Forgive me.<br> What did you say?<br> What were you two talking about?<br> I said to him:<br> "These are nice fat ones,<br> for this the archbishop will bless you. "<br> He said to me, "I do my share.

This is an order.<br> - Out to the ship once more?<br> - Yes.<br> You know, they're in their 92nd hour,<br> and starting to crack already.<br> - I didn't know that.<br> - Fading fast.<br> They never would have started this nonsense...<br> ...if Ben Canaan hadn't held a gun to them.<br> - Do you really think so?<br> - Undoubtedly.<br> Poor, ruddy beggars.<br> I don't see how you stand them.<br> Then let me ask you this, if I may.<br> Do you have the power to call off this strike?<br> I have.<br> If a compelling reason turned up. Why?<br> Then call it off.<br> I've been talking to Gen. Sutherland.<br> He's a humane man,<br> but there's nothing he can do.<br> You've made the issue so flatly<br> that no one can help you.<br> I know it, I feel it.<br> Either you compromise, or you lose.<br> We won't lose.<br> If the British give in and let us go, we've won.<br> And if we starve to death aboard this ship,<br> we've still won.<br> They'll wait.<br> They'll wait until you're too weak<br> and then come aboard and take you off.<br> It doesn't take much strength<br> to set off 200 pounds of dynamite.<br> You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?<br> Of course.<br> Without any regard<br> for the lives you'd be destroying?<br> With every regard in the world for them.<br> I don't understand.<br> Each person on board this ship is a soldier.<br> The only weapon we have to fight with<br> is our willingness to die.<br> But for what purpose?<br> Call it publicity.<br> - Publicity?<br> - Yes, publicity.<br> A stunt to attract attention.<br> A letter to the newspapers.<br> A help-wanted ad to the official journal<br> of the United Nations.<br> "Wanted by 600 men,<br> women and children, a country...<br> "... a native land, a home. "<br> That's all they're dying for.<br> Just to call attention to Israel...<br> ...without ever having seen it themselves.<br> Does the vulgarity of it shock you?<br> You can't fight the whole British Empire<br> with 600 people.<br> It isn't possible.<br> How many Minutemen did you have<br> when they fired...<br> ...the "shot heard round the world"?<br> - I don't know.<br> -77.<br> Look, please understand me.<br> I wish you could win.<br> I wish it were possible for you<br> to have a country of your own.<br> But it isn't.<br> You're offering the lives of all these people<br> for something that can never happen.<br> I know. I've been in Palestine.<br> - When were you there?<br> - A year ago.<br> Mr. Ben Canaan, even if you get a partition<br> and a free Jewish state...<br> ...the Arabs won't let you keep it.<br> You can't win.<br> You think I'm a fool.<br> But I came to appeal to you<br> to call off the hunger strike...<br> ...and avoid a tragedy.<br> Why don't you appeal to Gen. Sutherland?<br> What can I tell him?<br> Tell him what God said to Moses:<br> "Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,<br> 'Thus sayeth the Lord:<br> "'Let my people go, that they may serve me. "'<br> Exodus, Chapter 7, Verse 26.<br> We have been asked to talk to you,<br> Mr. Ben Canaan.<br> - Do you have time?<br> - Of course.<br> Excuse me.<br> We have made a decision among the mothers.<br> To send the children back to Karaolos now<br> will show weakness.<br> The British will see<br> that we are not serious people aboard this ship.<br> It doesn't matter what the British think.<br> I cannot take the responsibility<br> for letting children starve to death.<br> We will take the responsibility.<br> We will not send them back,<br> and we will not go back with them.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Frankel.<br> The children must go back.<br> You go back if you want to with them.<br> Now, that's a Haganah order.<br> You're an important man,<br> Mr. Ari Ben Canaan, but you know nothing.<br> Look at these babies of mine.<br> Born behind barbed wire.<br> For the first time they don't have to<br> look out through a fence like little animals.<br> They are free now, and nobody...<br> ...no Englishman, no Haganah,<br> will ever lock them up again.<br> Look at Mrs. Hirschberg here.<br> Hers will be the first,<br> when she has no more milk to give.<br> - Tell him.<br> - I will not take him back to Karaolos.<br> He will go to Palestine with me,<br> or here on this ship, we will die together.<br> I will not take him back.<br> When are you going to stop this thing<br> and let them go?<br> Unfortunately, I can't answer that.<br> The affair's entirely in the hands of London.<br> But you don't like what's going on.<br> You know how wrong it is.<br> Why don't you say so?<br> Why don't you make a public statement about it?<br> I can't do that, Kitty. I'm a soldier.<br> I know you're a soldier, but you're also a Jew...<br> ...and all these people out there are Jews, too.<br> I don't like to disappoint you,<br> but I'm not in any degree a Jew.<br> - But I thought...<br> - I know the rumour.<br> There had to be some explanation...<br> ...for my attitude<br> towards this unpleasant business.<br> - I'm sorry for flying off like that.<br> - You're getting to be quite a Zionist.<br> As a matter of fact, I'm glad you did fly off.<br> You asked how I, as a Jew,<br> could let this happen to other Jews.<br> Now I find myself asking<br> how can any man let it happen?<br> Jew, Gentile, Buddhist, Mohammedan...<br> ...no matter what he is.<br> Signal the air base.<br> I'm flying to London within the hour.<br> You know, you're an interesting woman,<br> Mrs. Fremont.<br> Sutherland won't let one member<br> of the press come aboard...<br> ...and you shuttle back and forth<br> like a carrier pigeon.<br> I know you suspect me,<br> and I know nothing I say can make you trust me.<br> But I wanted to tell you<br> that Gen. Sutherland has left for London.<br> He understands your situation,<br> and he is trying to help.<br> Thanks.<br> Is that all?<br> I heard of Dr. Odenheim's death.<br> I'm a trained nurse,<br> and I worked with him at Karaolos.<br> If I can be useful, I'd be glad to stay aboard.<br> Without food?<br> I think I can go without food as long as you.<br> I'm glad to have you on board, Mrs. Fremont.<br> Glad to be aboard, Mr. Ben Canaan.<br> Whatever move you make,<br> you were dead 10 minutes ago.<br> I asked for an opinion from Romania?<br> Do you think the British will give in?<br> We'll give in first.<br> These schlemiels.<br> Maybe they think they've been hungry<br> once in a while.<br> They don't even begin to know<br> what real starvation is.<br> If you hate these people so much,<br> why do you want to go to Palestine with them?<br> Because there, Jews fight instead of talk.<br> When I get there, I'm going to join the Irgun.<br> They know how to do it.<br> I'm going to blow up every<br> British installation I can find.<br> I'm going to kill Englishmen...<br> ...and kill and kill them...<br> ...till there won't be any more.<br> - But the British aren't all bad.<br> - They're rotten, the whole bunch of them.<br> The British, all the Russians, the Poles-<br> - Not the Danes. When I was there-<br> - Them, too. Don't tell me.<br> That's not true.<br> The Hansens were Christians,<br> and they adopted me.<br> One little exception. That proves something?<br> There are lots of exceptions.<br> You just listen to me for a minute.<br> When the Nazis marched into Denmark...<br> ...they ordered every Jew<br> to wear a yellow armband...<br> ...with the Star of David on it. And when they-<br> - That's the worst thing that can happen?<br> - I said, listen!<br> You don't know what you're talking about.<br> The next morning, when every Jew in Denmark<br> had to wear his armband...<br> ...King Christian came out of Amalienborg Palace<br> for his morning ride.<br> And do you know something?<br> - He wore the Star of David on his arm.<br> - But why should-<br> And you know something else?<br> By afternoon,<br> everybody was wearing Stars of David.<br> Jews and Danes, and, well, just everybody.<br> Why'd they do that?<br> If you don't just know why they did it, Dov...<br> ...well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.<br> - Get the Olympia. I want to talk to them.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Control Headquarters calling the Olympia.<br> - Do you hear me?<br> - This is the Exodus.<br> Stand by for Maj. Caldwell.<br> You are no longer interested<br> in your last rook, Mr. Lakavitch?<br> We pause for politics?<br> Gen. Sutherland, at his own request,<br> has been relieved of his duties on Cyprus.<br> I have just received a message<br> from the Colonial Office. I quote:<br> "His Majesty's Government,<br> having no desire to witness needless suffering...<br> "... grants permission<br> for the Olympia to sail to Palestine...<br> "... and to disembark its passengers<br> at the port of Haifa. "<br> That is all.<br> Ari Ben Canaan!<br> Well, happy landing, Mrs. Fremont.<br> - You'll find your luggage at customs.<br> - Thank you.<br> Have you seen Mr. Ben Canaan?<br> I want to thank him for letting me on the ship.<br> He and the other Haganah guys<br> went over the side two hours ago.<br> Too many British soldiers<br> on the reception committee.<br> - Karen?<br> - Have you seen Dov?<br> No, not since he left the ship.<br> - He was assigned to Gan Dafna.<br> - He'll show up.<br> I'm going to the American consulate<br> and then to the Jewish Agency.<br> As soon as I find anything,<br> loll come to Gan Dafna.<br> Gan Dafna, all aboard.<br> - Bye, Karen.<br> - If you see Dov, tell him where I am.<br> Inside.<br> This is no accident, he's got the address<br> written down. Fetch the car.<br> Here, you dirty little Irgun swine.<br> Hello?<br> Shalom.<br> Yaov, take the dog out.<br> Again?<br> A boy about 17 just went into Asa's house.<br> They took him in a police car. Get a look at him.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Karen. What's yours?<br> Edna. Come, we'll go up and eat something.<br> Now, if you will please resume a little order...<br> ...I will introduce a man<br> who has done more than any other...<br> ...to establish our village of Gan Dafna.<br> Only 10 days ago...<br> ...he was in London, negotiating with the British.<br> Today he is home again.<br> I have the honour to present<br> Mr. Barak Ben Canaan...<br> ...member of the Executive Committee...<br> ...of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.<br> My dear young friends, I know you're very tired.<br> You've had a long trip,<br> so I'm not going to make speeches.<br> It's good to have parties like this.<br> But it's also good to know what you're here for.<br> You are here to learn. You are here to work.<br> You are here to build<br> a Jewish homeland in Palestine.<br> It says on the banner "young heroes. " Very fine.<br> But here at Gan Dafna you will find<br> that even the biggest hero...<br> ...must work in the fields,<br> just like the littlest coward.<br> Boys and girls,<br> when I came to Palestine 47 years ago...<br> ...it was not a musical reception<br> with little cakes served.<br> I came walking, with my little brother...<br> ...all the way from Russia.<br> And over in that valley,<br> the swamps, and mosquitoes so big...<br> ...they were picking fights with the sparrows.<br> Now we have changed those swamps<br> into such fields.<br> On a quiet night, you can hear the corn grow.<br> Oranges so big...<br> ...five already make a dozen.<br> Over there you see the Arab village of Abu Yesha.<br> In those days, my old friend Kammal...<br> ...may God rest his soul...<br> ...was mukhtar of the village.<br> And then one day,<br> he donated to us this ground...<br> ...on which you stand, for a youth village.<br> So, we began to build this place.<br> And again it wasn't a matter<br> of little cakes and music.<br> It meant more sweat, more work.<br> Look about you.<br> You will see Arab children here.<br> Three of them, grandsons of that same Kammal...<br> ...the mukhtar who gave us this land.<br> It grieves me that he isn't with us today<br> to see all this.<br> But he's been gathered to the bosom of Allah.<br> Speak always that name with respect.<br> With us, instead,<br> we have the son of Kammal, Taha...<br> ...an honour to his father's memory.<br> Raised part of the time in my house,<br> with my own dear son, Ari...<br> ...and with my dear daughter, Jordana,<br> who sits beside him in this place.<br> I want you to give particular attention<br> to what he's going to tell to you.<br> Here is Taha, son of Kammal, since five years...<br> ...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.<br> Thank you, Barak Ben Canaan.<br> Village president, Dr. Ernst Lieberman.<br> In this valley of Jezreel,<br> we dwell together as friends.<br> It is natural that we should live in peace.<br> Since even our words for it<br> are almost exactly the same.<br> We say salaam...<br> ...and you, shalom.<br> Let us seal our friendship forever<br> with that most beautiful of Hebrew toasts.<br> L'chaim, to life.<br> L'chaim!<br> Come on.<br> Dov Landau.<br> Immigration says you're legal,<br> so we've no reason to keep you.<br> The Jewish Agency sent a bus ticket<br> and lunch money.<br> You're assigned to Gan Dafna.<br> You take my advice and go there.<br> Don't hang around Haifa. You'll get in trouble.<br> Don't wander into the Arab section.<br> Or you'll run into the Mufti's gangsters<br> and they'll kill you, son.<br> They'll slit your throat.<br> And keep away from the Irgun.<br> - And then, after the ghetto was destroyed?<br> - I hid in the sewers for five months.<br> Eating what?<br> When I couldn't sneak out at night<br> and steal garbage, I killed rats.<br> And then one night they caught me.<br> - And they sent you to Auschwitz?<br> - Yes.<br> To what work were you assigned in Auschwitz?<br> I told you that twice already.<br> It was mostly clean up.<br> - Cleaning up what?<br> - The camp area.<br> That's all there was to do.<br> That and working in the kitchens.<br> And when Auschwitz was liberated,<br> you walked to Germany?<br> You asked me that already, too.<br> May I talk with the young man for a moment?<br> So you want to blow up British installations<br> for the Irgun?<br> Yes.<br> You're an expert dynamiter, true?<br> Just try me.<br> There's still a point or two<br> we do not completely understand.<br> - Will you assist us in making them clear?<br> - Sure.<br> And make certain to tell the truth?<br> Why shouldn't I tell the truth?<br> This is always hard to answer.<br> First, I will ask you, please,<br> to recreate for me again how it was in Auschwitz.<br> Now, think most carefully about it,<br> and describe it to me.<br> Describe what?<br> Whatever you like.<br> For instance, how it was that people<br> were chosen to live or to be killed.<br> First you undressed...<br> ...and then they clipped your hair.<br> And then you all lined up,<br> and you went to the station room.<br> So the way you remember it,<br> they were men, women, children...<br> ...all together and all naked.<br> Yes.<br> And then the doctors examined you...<br> ...and told you what gate to take.<br> There were three gates.<br> If you were to be killed,<br> then you went through the left gate.<br> Which most of them did.<br> Yes. Most.<br> But if you were strong enough to work,<br> then you went through the right gate.<br> Which you did.<br> Yes.<br> - And then they assigned you to-<br> - You said there were three gates.<br> Who went through the third gate?<br> Girls.<br> - All the girls?<br> - No.<br> Only if they were young and pretty.<br> What happened to them?<br> The SS guards kept some of them.<br> The rest were sent around to army camps...<br> ...for the soldiers.<br> You have a good memory.<br> Now, those who went<br> through the left gate to be killed...<br> ...how was the killing accomplished<br> in Auschwitz?<br> They went in to take showers,<br> And the doors were locked.<br> And then came the gas.<br> Very professional. One thing I overlooked.<br> You say you got this dynamiting experience<br> in the Warsaw Ghetto fighting Nazis.<br> That's right.<br> You blew up quite a few Nazis<br> with this dynamite?<br> All I could.<br> Good.<br> Now, return to Auschwitz, please.<br> From the gas chambers, the bodies went where?<br> The ovens.<br> At Auschwitz,<br> they had crematoriums only at the last.<br> Before the installation of the ovens,<br> what happened to the bodies?<br> They buried them.<br> How?<br> In trenches and holes.<br> - And who dug the holes?<br> - I don't know.<br> I ask you again, who dug the graves?<br> I don't know.<br> They had demolition squads.<br> At least sometimes they did.<br> To blow holes in the ground...<br> ...then dump the bodies in.<br> That is correct.<br> Now may I tell you something, Dov Landau?<br> At no time did the Jews use dynamite<br> in the Warsaw Ghetto.<br> They had no dynamite.<br> Do you remember better now?<br> Maybe.<br> So it was not possible for you to learn<br> the use of dynamite in the Warsaw Ghetto.<br> You learned about dynamite in Auschwitz...<br> ...making mass graves to receive<br> the dead bodies of your people.<br> True?<br> Yes.<br> Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them.<br> And you saved your own life<br> by working in that camp as a Sonderkommando.<br> - Correct?<br> - Yes.<br> It was the duty of those Jews<br> who became Sonderkommandos...<br> ...to shave the heads of other Jews.<br> Yes.<br> To remove dead bodies from the gas chambers.<br> To collect gold fillings from their teeth.<br> Yes!<br> What could I do?<br> We take into consideration that you were<br> less than 13 when you entered Auschwitz.<br> Even so, we must have the truth.<br> Is there anything else?<br> Yes.<br> Then tell us.<br> No, I won't tell you.<br> Please, don't make me tell you.<br> Kill me. I don't care.<br> - I won't tell you.<br> - Tell us.<br> They used me.<br> They used me...<br> ...like you use...<br> ...a woman.<br> You will repeat for me the following words:<br> "I, Dov Landau...<br> I, Dov Landau...<br> "... do give my body, my brain,<br> my soul and my being...<br> ...do give my body, my brain,<br> my soul and my being...<br> "... without reservation or qualification...<br> ...without reservation or qualification...<br> "... to the freedom fighters of the Irgun.<br> ...to the freedom fighters of the Irgun.<br> "Under torture, even unto death...<br> Under torture, even unto death...<br> "... I will never divulge the name<br> of a fellow member of the Irgun. "<br> ...I will never divulge the name<br> of a fellow member of the Irgun.<br> - You wanted me?<br> - Yes.<br> So?<br> I've got to see Akiva. Where is he?<br> We tell Haganah where our leaders are hiding?<br> Forget Haganah. Akiva's my uncle.<br> And Barak Ben Canaan is your father.<br> We trust him as we trust the Grand Mufti.<br> - His son's different?<br> - Just tell Akiva and let him decide.<br> - I don't even know if he's in Jerusalem.<br> - So tell him anyway.<br> If I can find him,<br> where can I telephone you this evening?<br> I'll be here on the terrace from 7:00 on.<br> Do you like the view here?<br> Mr. Ben Canaan.<br> - Are we both eating alone?<br> - I am.<br> - Or I was. Won't you sit down?<br> - Thanks.<br> I know all the good things on that menu.<br> May I order for you?<br> - Would you like a drink?<br> - I had one at the consulate.<br> I had another one when I came to my room.<br> Have another one.<br> - Dry martini.<br> - Two very dry martinis.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> I'll take the hors d'oeuvres, clear soup...<br> ...fillet of sole...<br> ...salad...<br> ...and some of your very good Chablis.<br> We'll order dessert later.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What were you doing at the consulate today?<br> I've asked them to help me find Karen's father.<br> Yes, the girl. Please forget what I said...<br> ...about getting hysterical<br> over the life of one child.<br> I didn't mean it.<br> I know you didn't.<br> What happens if you find out her father's dead?<br> Then I'll take her back to America with me.<br> If she likes it there, I may adopt her.<br> Won't your husband<br> have something to say about that?<br> My husband was killed a year ago...<br> ...in a border skirmish<br> near the Sheikh Hussein bridge.<br> You mean, here in Palestine?<br> He was a news photographer<br> covering the Near East.<br> About the girl's father, if you like,<br> I can put some of our Haganah boys on it.<br> The British High Commissioner to Palestine.<br> Taken over the whole south wing of the hotel<br> in British general headquarters.<br> - Don't you feel uncomfortable here?<br> - I guess I'm as safe here as any place else.<br> Besides, I spent 14 months in prison.<br> Tell me about yourself.<br> Where do you come from?<br> I don't come from anywhere. I'm a sabra.<br> A native-born Palestinian.<br> My father was born in Russia.<br> He has a farm near Moshav Yad El.<br> - Do you like farms?<br> - I was raised on one.<br> I'd like to show you ours.<br> That'll be a little difficult.<br> I've rented a car and I'm driving<br> to Gan Dafna tomorrow to visit Karen.<br> That's only a few miles past Yad El.<br> I'm going up myself in the morning.<br> Do I know you well enough to ask you for a lift?<br> I think so.<br> - My name is Kitty.<br> - Ari.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll teach you a Hebrew toast. L'chaim!<br> I know it. To life.<br> Good for you.<br> A year's a long time in the life of a pretty woman.<br> Have you found another man?<br> - Nothing serious.<br> - Why not?<br> Many reasons.<br> One of them is that my husband's work<br> filled his whole life.<br> I presume that's good,<br> at least most men seem to think so.<br> But I feel a man who has nothing but his work<br> is only half a man.<br> And you want a whole one?<br> Exactly.<br> The other half of his life must be a woman.<br> What else?<br> What else?<br> Excuse me, sir. Telephone for you, call, please.<br> Excuse me. I'll be right back.<br> Come with me.<br> Now?<br> - I have to go back to the terrace. I want-<br> - You want to arrange to have us followed.<br> Let's go.<br> Ari.<br> Come in.<br> Sit down.<br> You must have some tea.<br> There's an extra glass around here somewhere.<br> You look better than ever, Uncle Akiva.<br> It's an active life.<br> You've been active yourself recently.<br> This Exodus business<br> shows in your heart you're really an Irgunist.<br> Two hundred pounds of dynamite?<br> Immediately,<br> the British draw proper conclusions.<br> Now, it's no accident<br> that brings you here tonight.<br> - May I speculate?<br> - Of course.<br> The Irgun has been blowing up<br> too many British installations.<br> We behave rudely to our British guests.<br> So the leading intellectuals of the Haganah,<br> after endless meetings and much debate...<br> ...have at last reached a decision.<br> - Correct?<br> - It's close.<br> They say, "Send Ari Ben Canaan".<br> "The old criminal's getting soft in the head".<br> "He loves the boy.<br> Maybe Ari can stop his indelicate activities. "<br> - Also correct?<br> - Also.<br> But they want something more.<br> If the UN votes for Partition,<br> we'll have the Arab world on our backs.<br> Our only hope is an alliance<br> between Irgunand Haganah.<br> An alliance to fight? Of course.<br> The minute Haganah adopts our policy<br> of fighting instead of talking...<br> ...an alliance between us becomes automatic.<br> You're not being fair.<br> When it comes to fighting,<br> Haganah has lost more lives than Irgun.<br> We fight to defend ourselves, or to capture<br> positions that we can occupy and hold.<br> When you attack it's just to spread terror.<br> Your duty is done.<br> You have given me the official line.<br> But what about you, Ari?<br> Forget Haganah for one moment,<br> and tell me what you think.<br> I think these bombings and these killings<br> hurt us with the United Nations.<br> A year ago we had the respect<br> of the whole world.<br> Now, when they read about us,<br> it's nothing but terror and violence.<br> It's not the first time this happens in history.<br> I don't know of one nation,<br> whether existing now or in the past...<br> ...that was not born in violence.<br> Terror, violence, death.<br> They are the midwives<br> who bring free nations into this world.<br> Compromisers like the Haganah<br> produce only abortions.<br> Before you have a country,<br> you have to have people.<br> That's the job we've done.<br> Tens of thousands of people smuggled in...<br> ...with the whole British Navy<br> blockading the coast.<br> The population we've built<br> is our most valid argument for independence.<br> How can we ask the UN for a just decision...<br> ...when we keep blowing up things<br> like a bunch of anarchists?<br> You have just used the words "a just decision. "<br> May I tell you something?<br> Firstly...<br> ...justice itself is an abstraction...<br> ...completely devoid of reality.<br> Second, to speak of justice and Jews<br> in the same breath...<br> ...is a logical uncertainty.<br> Thirdly...<br> ...one can argue the justice<br> of Arab claims on Palestine...<br> ...just as one can argue<br> the justice of Jewish claims.<br> Fourthly...<br> ...no one can say the Jews have not had...<br> ...more than their share of injustice<br> these past 10 years.<br> I therefore say, fifthly...<br> ...let the next injustice<br> work against somebody else for a change.<br> You just changed the subject on me.<br> You noticed.<br> I suppose that means more bombings<br> and more killings?<br> I'll put it this way.<br> Let the National Committee keep on trying<br> to talk the British out of Palestine.<br> We have no objections.<br> We will continue to bomb them out.<br> - Now tell me, how is your mother?<br> - She's fine.<br> And little Jordana?<br> Little Jordana just won her second<br> marksmanship medal with the Palmach.<br> And that young rascal, David Ben Ami,<br> she's still interested?<br> She can't wait till he gets back from Cyprus.<br> And Barak...<br> ...still counts my name among the dead<br> on Yom Kippur?<br> Ten years.<br> It's a long time to be dead<br> to the only family you have.<br> Doesn't he understand<br> I must work for Israel in my way...<br> ...just as he works for it in his?<br> You can't talk to him about it. I've tried.<br> Of course.<br> It's not much of a home, is it?<br> With only Rose's samovar to make a memory real.<br> Every time I come home,<br> I stop here to look for a minute.<br> - You want to look with me?<br> - Sure.<br> It's beautiful!<br> The Valley of Jezreel.<br> If you dug straight down far enough there,<br> you'd find the ruins of Meggido.<br> You'd find the very same paving stones<br> that Joshua walked on when he conquered it.<br> That's Abu Yesha. That's an Arab village.<br> To the left is Gan Dafna.<br> - Do you know your Bible?<br> - In a Presbyterian sort of way.<br> That's Mount Tabor.<br> I remember.<br> Where Deborah gathered her armies.<br> That's where she stood when she watched<br> Barak march out to fight the Canaanites.<br> "So Barak went down from Mount Tabor,<br> and 10,000 men with him. "<br> It's in the Book of Judges.<br> The Canaanites had 900 iron chariots...<br> ...but Barak had men.<br> That's when the Jews first came to this valley.<br> It wasn't just yesterday or the day before.<br> Isn't your father's name Barak?<br> In Russia, he was Yakov Rabinski.<br> But when he came here,<br> he took the name of Deborah's general.<br> He called himself Barak Ben Canaan.<br> Barak, the son of Canaan, and this valley<br> became a Jewish land once again.<br> He can give you the date every clump<br> of trees was planted there, to the month.<br> Don't get excited.<br> We're not debating now.<br> I'll grant anything you say.<br> I just wanted you to know that I'm a Jew.<br> This is my country.<br> I do know. I understand.<br> Sometimes it's not that easy.<br> It's the easiest thing in the world, Ari.<br> All these differences between people<br> are made up.<br> People are the same,<br> no matter what they're called.<br> Don't ever believe it.<br> People are different.<br> They have a right to be different.<br> They like to be different.<br> It's no good pretending<br> the differences don't exist, they do.<br> They have to be recognized and respected.<br> I recognize them. I respect them.<br> Don't you understand<br> that you make me feel like a Presbyterian...<br> ...when you can't, for just a minute or two,<br> forget that you're a Jew?<br> You're wrong, Ari.<br> There are no differences.<br> Ari, my boy.<br> Papa, this is Mrs. Fremont.<br> Shalom, Mr. Ben Canaan.<br> Welcome to Yad El, Mrs. Fremont.<br> If you'll excuse me, I will tell your mother.<br> Mama!<br> - Mama, where are you?<br> - I'm here, Barak.<br> - Have you hurt yourself?<br> - No. Ari is home.<br> - Ari?<br> - He's downstairs! Wait a minute.<br> - He's got a girl with him.<br> - A girl?<br> - An American girl.<br> - How do you know she's American?<br> Sarah, I travel. I can recognize national types.<br> - What is her name, Barak?<br> - Mrs. Fremont.<br> Mrs? So, where is her husband?<br> - Why does she go chasing after my Ari?<br> - Whether she's chasing him, I don't know.<br> If you ask me, "Is Ari chasing her?"<br> Frankly, that is a possibility.<br> For you maybe. Not for my Ari.<br> Better stop talking like a goat.<br> My Ari comes home and there's not a thing<br> in the house to eat, not a bite.<br> Hello! Rebecca.<br> Now, say "ah. "<br> Yes?<br> - What a nice surprise.<br> - Tell my daughter, Jordana.<br> Of course.<br> No trouble at all.<br> There. You're all right.<br> Jordana, your brother Ari is at Yad El,<br> I just spoke to your papa.<br> Ari? Take this for me.<br> Now, young ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...can you give me a little style?<br> It's not fair keeping David in Cyprus so long.<br> He could be doing something just as important<br> right here in Palestine.<br> That's exactly what he says.<br> But he tells me in his letter<br> that he may be gone another year.<br> I know Haganah would call him back,<br> if you would only use your influence.<br> Any girl that falls in love with a Palestinian boy<br> has a long wait coming.<br> - A nice piece of strudel, Mrs. Fremont?<br> - I couldn't.<br> Mrs. Fremont, you're a very pretty girl,<br> but you could stand a little weight on you.<br> Also your colour is not too good.<br> If it wasn't for me, David wouldn't be in Cyprus<br> working for Haganah.<br> He wanted to join the Irgun. You know that.<br> I saw Uncle Akiva in Jerusalem.<br> He sends you his love.<br> You will not mention that name in my house.<br> Father, he's all alone.<br> - He wants to forget what happened-<br> - To me, he is dead.<br> At this moment when the very existence<br> of a free Israel hangs by a thread...<br> ...before the UN, he presents us to the world<br> like a bunch of murderers!<br> - He has a right to do-<br> - He is dead!<br> I don't remember his name,<br> I don't remember his face, he is dead!<br> Barak.<br> I have to get to Gan Dafna, now.<br> That is if you are ready, Mrs. Fremont?<br> - You should see it before dark.<br> - Sorry you have to leave so soon.<br> - Maybe I'll wrap your strudel.<br> - No, don't bother.<br> Goodbye, Mrs. Ben Canaan.<br> And thank you for the good food.<br> Bye. I hope you'll come back soon.<br> The next time maybe a little hungrier.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Barak, you should be ashamed of yourself,<br> in front of a stranger.<br> And do you know something else?<br> I've been elected to the Rooms Committee,<br> Bungalow 12.<br> - Already?<br> - Yes.<br> - You remember Edna, the girl with freckles?<br> - I think so.<br> She's helping me with Hebrew,<br> so I can catch up with the others.<br> - Hebrew?<br> - Yes. We have a language of our own now.<br> And there's something else, too.<br> When you're 16, you join the Palmach.<br> They're soldiers, and everybody joins, also girls.<br> I didn't show you the statue of Dafna.<br> She was a young soldier.<br> The Arabs captured her and they tortured her<br> to find out things from her.<br> But she wouldn't tell.<br> So they sent her back to Yad El<br> in a sack tied to the back of a mule.<br> They cut off her hands and her feet,<br> and they gouged out her eyes.<br> But she wouldn't tell them anything.<br> - She was very young.<br> - Seventeen.<br> She and Ari Ben Canaan were in love.<br> They grew up together.<br> They were sweethearts all their lives.<br> That's why Ari never got married.<br> They named the village after her.<br> And there's something else, too.<br> Dr. Lieberman knows my father.<br> I mean, he's read my father's books.<br> He knows who my father is.<br> That's wonderful.<br> - We have to go to supper now.<br> - I'm sorry, I couldn't eat a thing.<br> - I had too much at Yad El.<br> - Then I'll come back afterwards.<br> You're just going to love it here, Kitty.<br> What's the matter? You act like a stranger.<br> I feel like one.<br> I guess I'd feel the same way, too,<br> if I suddenly found myself in Indiana.<br> You just don't understand us yet.<br> Stop saying that.<br> I can understand just as well as you can.<br> I didn't come here to fight with you.<br> I have to get to Jerusalem.<br> I came to say goodbye.<br> Ari.<br> What?<br> I had an accident on the road today.<br> It wasn't your fault...<br> ...but I'm going to drive more carefully<br> from now on.<br> - You don't really mean that.<br> - I do.<br> You were right.<br> We are different.<br> I've been feeling the difference all afternoon.<br> I feel...<br> ...outside.<br> The way your mother and father...<br> They were perfectly charming,<br> I don't mean that, but...<br> ...the way they looked at me,<br> the way your sister talks to me...<br> It doesn't make any sense to discuss it,<br> no sense at all.<br> If it doesn't make any sense to discuss it,<br> we'll just forget it.<br> If I get any word on the girl's father,<br> I'll let you know. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello. How have you been?<br> - Fine, thank you.<br> - Hello.<br> Karen, you do understand<br> that it's been a long time since you've seen him.<br> He may have changed so much,<br> you won't recognize him.<br> - I'll recognize him.<br> - Good.<br> - Doctor?<br> - Yes?<br> - Dr. Engel, Mrs. Fremont.<br> - Good day.<br> - And Karen.<br> - How do you do?<br> - The young lady understands, does she not?<br> - Yes, we told her everything.<br> That's good.

What do you want?<br> The UN may vote on Partition<br> by the end of the month.<br> We listen to the radio also.<br> Half the leadership of Irgun<br> and 40 members of Haganah...<br> - ... are rotting down there in Acre prison.<br> - Including Akiva, your uncle. So?<br> If Partition is voted,<br> we'll need every man to fight the Arabs.<br> Irgun, Haganah, what difference does it make?<br> I spent 14 months in that prison.<br> I know every inch.

"<br> We would wish the hour of parting between us...<br> ...and England...<br> ...to be one of honour.<br> We must record that in most instances...<br> ...British soldiers carried out<br> the unrelenting policy of their government...<br> ...with tact and compassion.<br> There are many cases on record<br> of British soldiers and sailors...<br> ...risking their lives to save Jewish refugees.<br> And to the Arab population of Jewish Palestine,<br> we make the following appeal:<br> The Grand Mufti has asked you<br> either to annihilate the Jewish population...<br> ...or to abandon your homes and your lands...<br> ...and to seek the weary path of exile.<br> We implore you...<br> ...remain in your homes...<br> ...and in your shops...<br> ...and we shall work together as equals...<br> ...in the free state of Israel!<br> What's wrong?<br> - You've won your freedom.

We have to prove to the world<br> that we can get along together.<br> If we don't, then the British are right,<br> we cannot govern ourselves without them.<br> Excuse me.<br> All our lives we've understood each other<br> and loved each other.<br> Now, when it means everything, I can't reach him.<br> You'll make him understand, Ari.

Leave. Don't let anyone see you.<br> - Go through the olive grove.<br> - What happened?<br> You must evacuate Gan Dafna<br> by midnight tomorrow.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - Don't ask questions, just do it.<br> If the children aren't out of this valley,<br> they will be butchered like sheep.<br> If the Mufti's men are in the house<br> or if they're attacking Gan Dafna, tell me.<br> Haven't I told you enough already?<br> Do you want me to dishonour myself completely?<br> Goodbye.<br> They're the same gangsters<br> who murdered your father.<br> - You can't get involved with them.<br> - Ari, I know what I'm doing.<br> We grew up as brothers.<br> If there's trouble with the Mufti,<br> let's face it together, as always.<br> I'll get word to the Palmach.<br> We'll defend Abu Yesha and Gan Dafna<br> instead of surrendering them.<br> I cannot do it.<br> Today, more than ever before,<br> I realize that I'm a Moslem.<br> I cannot go against my own people.<br> I cannot kill another Arab.<br> If you were ever my friend,<br> prove it now by leaving this house.<br> May Allah watch over you all the days of your life.<br> - Who goes?<br> - Dov Landau.<br> I knew they wouldn't catch you.<br> - Who's in charge?<br> - Jordana Ben Canaan.<br> Only, she isn't here now.<br> She went to Fort Esther<br> to try to make them give our guns back.<br> - Have you got headquarters set up here?<br> - In the dining hall.<br> Don't hold a Molotov like that.<br> Here, hold it like this.<br> We've less than 100 heavy machine guns<br> in the country.<br> Most of our ammunition<br> isn't accurate beyond 100 yards.<br> Now, the Palmach have about 6,000 other arms...<br> ...and the Irgun, another 1,500.<br> - From now on, we work together.<br> - Something coming through.<br> Haganah Safed calling.<br> "We've had an Arab uprising in progress<br> since sundown.<br> "We have 40 rifles...<br> "... 42 homemade Stens...<br> "... one machine gun and one mortar...<br> "... plus handmade grenades.<br> "We still hold the centre of the city...<br> "... but we're heavily outnumbered. "<br> - Ari, how are you?<br> - I'm fine.<br> - How many guns have you got?<br> - Eight.<br> And about 180 Molotovs.<br> The British confiscated the rest.<br> I know. I heard.<br> Jordana went to Fort Esther<br> to try to get them back.<br> There's a detachment of Palmachs on the way.<br> But the Jerusalem road has been cut<br> in a dozen places.<br> I sneaked ahead to let you know.<br> The order is for every kibbutz and moshav<br> and village to fight to the end.<br> Nothing's to be surrendered.<br> - Is the transmitter working?<br> - Yes.<br> Then send this:<br> "Gan Dafna expects an attack in force<br> by tomorrow night.<br> "If the Palmach is on the way, tell them to hurry.<br> "We have 300 children here and eight guns. "<br> That's all.<br> Keep on sending that.<br> The commander refuses to return our weapons.<br> He said it would only provoke violence.<br> And he won't interfere in local problems,<br> except to punish troublemakers.<br> I suppose that means us,<br> if we try to defend ourselves.<br> They must know that<br> the whole border's alive with armed Arabs.<br> I think the Mufti's men have<br> taken over Abu Yesha.<br> Taha warned us to evacuate here<br> before midnight tomorrow.<br> How many children do we have here under 13?<br> About 150.<br> We'll have to get them to Beth Amal tonight...<br> ...and secretly, so the Arabs don't know.<br> We'll go around the valley instead of through it.<br> That's near the border, but we must risk it.<br> We'll go through Ein Or<br> and down the other side of Mount Tabor.<br> You can't go down the other side of Tabor<br> in daytime, much less at night.<br> You'll kill half of them.<br> I'd rather lose half of them there<br> than all of them here.<br> With luck we'll be back by sunrise.<br> That means the older children<br> must handle things until we get back.<br> - What if they attack tonight?<br> - That's a risk we'll have to take.<br> Dov, you organize outside the fence.<br> Jordana, you take the inner area.<br> Make it look as though<br> we've got 1,000 people here.<br> Let's get to work.<br> Get dressed. Hurry up.<br> Get up, get dressed. Report to the dining hall.<br> Will you help me?<br> I want you to stay here.<br> If anything happens, they'll need a nurse.<br> Have you forgotten<br> every 15-year-old girl in Gan Dafna...<br> ...is a nurse, and a good one?<br> Stay here, anyway.<br> I don't want you mixed up in this.<br> Either I'm with you, or I'm not with you.<br> This is your choice,<br> and this is the time to make it, right now.<br> All right, you come along, then.<br> That's a Haganah order.<br> Now...<br> I want you to walk two by two,<br> holding hands so that nobody gets lost.<br> We're going very close to the border.<br> So from when we leave...<br> ...until the time we get to Beth Amal,<br> nobody says a word.<br> Nobody coughs, nobody sneezes,<br> nobody cries, nobody even whispers.<br> Do you understand?<br> - Will you promise?<br> - We will.<br> - No, say it.<br> - We promise.<br> - Not one word.<br> - Not one word.<br> Mr. Ben Ami, how many men did you bring?<br> Only two to a truck,<br> but from the outside it looks like an army.<br> Where is Jordana?<br> David! I'm so glad to see you.<br> - Halt! Stay where you are.<br> - It's me, Dov.<br> Watch out.<br> - What are you doing out here?<br> - Sixty Palmachniks just came.<br> - I know, I heard the trucks.<br> - So you can come back now.<br> No, I don't go back<br> until somebody relieves me of this position.<br> Stay down.<br> There are Arabs out there.<br> Ari said they won't attack until tomorrow night.<br> I killed one about three hours ago.<br> Down there.<br> Dov...<br> ...you have a beautiful name.<br> Sometimes I whisper it to myself.<br> - You'd better go back.<br> - When you do.<br> I'm 15 years old now.<br> - I'm not little anymore.<br> - You shouldn't have come here in the first place.<br> But, Dov, you're always fighting.<br> And you're always in a place<br> where you might be killed.<br> If anything should happen to you<br> before I told you how much I love you...<br> ...I just wouldn't want to live anymore.<br> Please, love me.<br> I'm not afraid. Honest, I'm not.<br> When things are all over, I'm going to marry you.<br> You'll be Mrs. Dov Landau.<br> You're going to have respect.<br> - They will tip their hats when you go by.<br> - And I will smile.<br> - I told you to go back twice already.<br> - Dov!<br> From now on, you do what I say.<br> You understand?<br> Now, keep down.<br> Be careful. Take cover wherever you can.<br> Shalom, Dov. I've come to relieve you.<br> - Is Ari back?<br> - Yes.<br> He got the children safely to Beth Amal.<br> It's been very quiet the last few hours. Shalom.<br> Shalom.<br> We are going to attack Abu Yesha<br> before they move.<br> Good. We'll never be stronger<br> than we are right now.<br> - Have you seen Karen?<br> - I sent them all to bed hours ago.<br> - What's my assignment?<br> - Patrol Gan Dafna while we move out.<br> Let's be sure they don't surprise us<br> while we surprise them.<br> David will jump them from behind...<br> ...and my group will attack<br> directly through the olive grove.<br> David, you'd better take Jordana with you,<br> she knows the village.<br> Nothing seems to be moving over there.<br> The muezzin hasn't called<br> for the morning prayers, either.<br> Cover us.<br> Somebody come and help me cut him down.<br> What's the matter?<br> This is Taha...<br> ...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.<br> And this is Karen...<br> ...Secretary of the Rooms Committee,<br> Bungalow 12, Gan Dafna.<br> We have no kadi...<br> ...to pray for Taha's soul.<br> And we have no rabbi...<br> ...to pray over Karen.<br> Taha should have lived a long life...<br> ...surrounded by his people and his sons.<br> And death should have come to him...<br> ...as an old friend...<br> ...offering the gift of sleep.<br> It came, instead, as a maniac.<br> And Karen, who loved her life...<br> ...and who lived it as purely as a flame,<br> why did God forget her?<br> Why did she have to stumble<br> onto death so young?<br> And all alone?<br> And in the dark?<br> We of all people...<br> ...should no longer be surprised<br> when death reaches out to us.<br> With the world's insanity<br> and our own slaughtered millions...<br> ...we should be used to senseless killing.<br> But I am not used to it.<br> I cannot and will not get used to it.<br> I look at these two people,<br> and I want to howl like a dog.<br> I want to shout "murder"...<br> ...so that the whole world will hear it<br> and never forget it.<br> It's right that these two people<br> should lie side by side in this grave...<br> ...because they will share it in peace.<br> But the dead always share the earth in peace.<br> And that's not enough.<br> It's time for the living to have a turn.<br> A few miles from here,<br> people are fighting and dying...<br> ...and we must join them. But I swear...<br> ...on the bodies of these two people...<br> ...that the day will come<br> when Arab and Jew will share...<br> ...in a peaceful life...<br> ...this land that they have always shared in death.<br> Taha, old friend...<br> ...and very dear brother.<br> Karen...<br> ...child of light...<br> ...daughter of Israel...<br> ...Shalom.<br>
