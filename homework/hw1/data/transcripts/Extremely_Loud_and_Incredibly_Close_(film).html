                        There are more people alive now<br> than have died in all of human history.<br> But the number of dead people<br> is increasing.<br> One day, there isn't going to be<br> any room to bury anyone any more.<br> So, what about skyscrapers<br> for dead people that were built down?<br> They could be underneath the skyscrapers<br> for living people that are built up.<br> You could bury people<br> ...and a whole dead world<br> could be underneath the living one.<br> ...father of our Lord, Jesus Christ,<br> who has blessed us all with the gift of...<br> Doesn't anybody know<br> there isn't anybody in the coffin?<br> We should've filled it with his shoes<br> or something.<br> It's like a pretend funeral.<br> For a goldfish or something.<br> This is just what it is, Oskar.<br> It doesn't make sense.<br> What if you could ride an elevator<br> down to visit your dead relatives...<br> ...just like you take the bridge<br> to see your friends in Brooklyn...<br> ...or the ferry to Staten Island?<br> Dad once told me that New York<br> used to have a Sixth Borough...<br> ...right next to Manhattan.<br> But you can't visit that any more...<br> ...because it floated away<br> and no one knows where it is.<br> Okay, you think you're so smart?<br> Let's find the Sixth Borough.<br> Okay.<br> And? What?<br> "And what" what?<br> What am I supposed to find?<br> What are the clues?<br> Mm.<br> He shrugged his shoulders like he had<br> no idea what I was talking about.<br> I loved that.<br> This was my favorite game<br> Dad and I would play.<br> We called it<br> "Reconnaissance Expedition. "<br> I found something from every decade<br> in the 20th Century.<br> You rack.<br> He racks!<br> The search for the Sixth Borough<br> was the greatest expedition ever.<br> All right, I've got<br> amateur entomologist, Francophile...<br> ...amateur archeologist,<br> computer consultant.<br> Why "amateur" everything?<br> It's a compliment.<br> Amateur pacifist?<br> "Pacifist."<br> - Amateur inventor.<br> Inventor. Goad one.<br> Okay, you're all set.<br> Dad designed my expeditions<br> so I would have to talk to people...<br> ...which he knew<br> I had a hard time doing.<br> What do you want?<br> What do you think?<br> Could be useful.<br> Can't you even tell me<br> if I'm an the right track?<br> But if you don't tell me,<br> haw can I ever be right?<br> Well, another way of lacking at it is...<br> ...haw can you ever be wrung?<br> Mm?<br> There you go. Thank you very much.<br> Central Park didn't use to be<br> where it is now.<br> Dad said it used to rest<br> in the center of the Sixth Borough.<br> Enormous hooks were driven<br> deep into the ground...<br> ...and the park was pulled by<br> all the people of New York...<br> ...like a rug across the flour,<br> from the Sixth Borough into Manhattan.<br> I found something. Over!<br> What area, Oskar? Over!<br> Zane E-3. Over!<br> Dad said it's only because<br> of the clues in Central Park...<br> ...that we know<br> the Sixth Borough existed at all.<br> Where's this from?<br> Oh, that was my father's.<br> Grandma gave it to me when I was little.<br> Never had much use for it.<br> What's this?<br> Oh. Grandma's old home movies.<br> Haven't seen these in years.<br> Do you know what your father<br> lacked like?<br> Nope, not a clue.<br> Here's what I do know:<br> He was from Dresden,<br> which was in Germany...<br> ...went through some really bad stuff...<br> ...and decided he wasn't up<br> to having a family.<br> That's it?<br> - That's it.<br> Did you always want to be a jeweler?<br> I might have liked<br> to have been a scientist.<br> I'll never know.<br> Why is that?<br> Because I'm a jeweler<br> Strawberry Fields.<br> Belvedere Castle.<br> What's he lacking far?<br> Well, when he finds it, let him tell you.<br> Gonna send him all aver the park...<br> ...and he'll have to talk to<br> every single person he meets.<br> It'll be the greatest<br> Reconnaissance Expedition.<br> Don't make it so hard an him.<br> If it was easy,<br> this wouldn't be worth finding.<br> And what kind of adult<br> is he gonna turn into?<br> I don't know.<br> That's what I have you far.<br> He'll be one of those guys who falls<br> in love with the very first bassy...<br> - Watch it.<br> - I mean, beautiful...<br> ...flaxen-haired lady<br> who tells him what to do.<br> - Like write the check?<br> - Oh...<br> - Haw much?<br> - It's the last one. It's 71.40.<br> - $11.40.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Bedtime!<br> Was there really a Sixth Borough?<br> Well, as with anything, if you want<br> to believe, you can find reasons ta.<br> What reasons?<br> The clues, of course.<br> What clues?<br> What clues? The clues!<br> The peculiar fossil record<br> of Central Park.<br> The incongruous pH balance<br> of that reservoir.<br> And that brings us to the swings.<br> According to the paper of record, ahem<br> ...a note was found beneath<br> one of those swings in Central Park.<br> And because of many scientific tests<br> ...which you are tan young<br> and I am tan simple to understand...<br> ...they were able to determine<br> that the note must have been written...<br> ...in the Sixth Borough.<br> What did it say?<br> What a fantastic question.<br> Let's find cut.<br> Ah... It doesn't say.<br> It ought ta, but it doesn't.<br> - Can I see that?<br> - You want to see what?<br> Wanna see this? Na?<br> That was the last conversation<br> we ever had.<br> - Give it!<br> - It's behind you, behind you! Hold an.<br> The next time I heard<br> my dad's voice...<br> ...was when I got home from school<br> that morning on the worst day.<br> Spaz!<br> Because of what was going on,<br> they let us out of school early.<br> Again, that's the incident,<br> that's what we are hearing.<br> This is terrible.<br> You're not supposed to smoke in the lobby.<br> You'll get in trouble.<br> There's no such thing as trouble today.<br> Where are your parents?<br> Is anybody downtown?<br> My mom's at work.<br> My dad's at a meeting somewhere.<br> Anyway, it's none of your business,<br> dip shiitake.<br> Eff you, Oskar.<br> Succotash my ball sack.<br> Oh, Gad.<br> Message one, September 11th, 8:56 a.m.<br> Are you there? Hello?<br> If you're there, darling, pick up.<br> Ugh. I just tried the office,<br> but no one was picking up<br> Uh, listen, uh, something's happened.<br> I'm okay.<br> They're telling us to stay where we are<br> and wait for the fireman.<br> I'm sure it's fine.<br> I'll give you another call<br> when I have a better idea<br> of what's going on.<br> I wanted to let you know that I'm okay<br> and not to worry...<br> ...and I'll call again soon.<br> All right, bye-bye.<br> Message two, September 11th, 9:12 a.m<br> Are you there? Are you there?<br> It's me again.<br> Hello?<br> I was hoping you would be home.<br> I don't know if you heard about what happened...<br> ...but I wanted you to<br> know that I'm okay.<br> Everything is fine. We're still waiting<br> to find out what we're supposed to do.<br> It's pretty chaotic. Firemen<br> are supposed to be coming. What...<br> If the sun were to explode...<br> you wouldn't even know<br> about it for eight minutes...<br> ...because that's how long it takes<br> for light to travel to us.<br> For eight minutes,<br> the world would still be bright...<br> ...and it would still feel warm.<br> It was a year since my dad died...<br> ...and I could feel<br> my eight minutes with him...<br> ...were running out.<br> Democrats argued<br> that Estrada is too conservative...<br> ...and not answering all<br> of their questions.<br> Estrada was first nominated<br> for the position in May, 2001.<br> The Bush administration has asked for a 4.2<br> percent increase in military spending...<br> ...from 365 billion dollars<br> to 380 billion dollars.<br> That figure does not include...<br> I hadn't gone into<br> my dads closet since the worst day.<br> Mom hadn't touched his stuff.<br> It was all there.<br> Oskar! You okay?<br> This is Oskar Schell.<br> Grandma? Grandma, are you awake?<br> Over.<br> Grandma?<br> It's Grandma. Uh, what is it, sweetheart?<br> Can't you sleep?<br> Do you want me to come over? Over.<br> Did Dad ever mention a special key<br> to you, Grandma? Over.<br> A special key?<br> I don't think so, no.<br> A special key? What for?<br> What was this special key for?<br> Over.<br> Is the Renter home? Over.<br> The Renter? No, no,<br> he's never home this early. Over.<br> Grandma had rented a room to a man...<br> ...three weeks after the worst day.<br> Why is the Renter's dour always<br> closed? And why can I never meet him?<br> He likes quiet.<br> Why can't you tell me<br> anything about him?<br> He's someone I knew in the old country.<br> Now play.<br> Haw long will he be here?<br> He never stays any place for lung.<br> Is he dangerous?<br> If you ever see him, don't say anything.<br> He can get very angry. New play.<br> What have you found, Oskar? Over.<br> Oskar, are you still there?<br> Oskar?<br> It's for some kind of lockbox<br> It's not like any of these.<br> It's thicker, harder to break.<br> But it's not for a fixed<br> safe, I don't think.<br> Could be a safe deposit box,<br> post office box.<br> It's old. Maybe 20, 30 years old.<br> Haw can I find the company<br> that made it?<br> Anyone could've made it<br> Then haw do I find the lack that it fits?<br> I'm afraid I can't help you there, unless you<br> wanna try it in anything you come across.<br> You never know what a key's gonna fit.<br> There are a million different possibilities.<br> That's what I love about keys.<br> They all open something.<br> Just one.<br> Shouldn't you be in school?<br> It's Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.<br> Lie number two<br> I started counting my lies earlier that<br> morning when I told Mom I had a fever.<br> I don't wanna potentially infect<br> a multitude of people at school.<br> I could be a walking pathogen<br> I thought Martin Luther King's birthday<br> was in January.<br> It used to be. They changed it.<br> That was lie number three.<br> Hold an, Oskar.<br> Who's "Black"?<br> On the envelope?<br> Anybody you know?<br> Could be somebody who knows<br> something about the key.<br> Thanks for being<br> such a great locksmith.<br> What do you need these far?<br> A project an the census.<br> Lie number four.<br> Why aren't you in school?<br> - They said I know tan much already.<br> - Ah.<br> Black, Black, Black.<br> Well, "Black" was definitely a person.<br> Probably.<br> If "Black" was a person, he or she<br> must have known Dad somehow.<br> Faur-hundred-seventy-two.<br> But how?<br> And how was I going to find him/her?<br> Was this a Reconnaissance<br> Expedition?<br> Lagos, Nigeria. And it drifted...<br> Dad's expeditions<br> always included a journey.<br> ...2278.3 nautical miles.<br> Brazil!<br> And he always planned them,<br> down to the smallest details.<br> Five miles an hour.<br> Seven hundred.<br> What else could it be?<br> If there was a key,<br> there was a lock.<br> If there was a name,<br> there was a person.<br> I'm home.<br> There had to be a lock.<br> I would find it because<br> he wanted me to find it.<br> Q-56. Q-56. Q-56.<br> And I would find it because it was the only<br> way I could stretch my 8 minutes with him.<br> Maybe I could stretch them forever.<br> I put together a backpack of vita!<br> Things I would need for my survival.<br> An Israeli gas mask Grandma bought me<br> two weeks after the worst day.<br> My tambourine to help keep me calm.<br> Binoculars, obviously.<br> I had to travel light<br> to be as quick as possible.<br> My expedition journal.<br> My father's father's camera.<br> A Brief History Of Time, by Stephen<br> Hawking, that my dad used to read to me.<br> Cell phone.<br> Fig Newtons, which I love.<br> The key, obviously.<br> And my father's message<br> to not stop looking.<br> And I wouldn't, not ever.<br> Hey.<br> Where you going?<br> Out.<br> Where?<br> I told you, to the comic book<br> convention with Minch. Be back later.<br> Lie number five.<br> Except for the "be back later" part.<br> Well, leave your cell phone on.<br> Check in with me every hour, okay?<br> I mean it.<br> I didn't know what<br> was waiting for me.<br> Although my stomach hurt<br> and my eyes were watering...<br> ...I made up my mind that nothing,<br> nothing was going to stop me.<br> Not even me.<br> First up, Abby Black,<br> Fort Greene, Brooklyn.<br> Because public transportation<br> makes me panicky, I walked.<br> I've always had a hard time<br> doing certain things.<br> The elevator works, genius.<br> I know, retard.<br> But the worst day<br> made the list of things a lot longer.<br> - Old people...<br> - Ah!<br> ...Running people...<br> ...airplanes...<br> ...tall things...<br> ...things you can get stuck in.<br> Loud things.<br> - Screaming, crying.<br> - Aah!<br> - People with bad teeth...<br> - Ha-ha-ha!<br> ...Bags without owners, shoes without<br> owners, children without parents...<br> ...ringing things, smoking things,<br> people eating meat...<br> ...people looking up.<br> Towers, tunnels, speeding things...<br> ...loud things, things with lights,<br> things with wings.<br> Bridges make me especially panicky.<br> - Come on, try.<br> - I can't try.<br> If you don't try, you'll never know.<br> - So try.<br> - Don't be disappointed with me!<br> Come on. Take your juice<br> You know, Grandma brought me<br> to these swings.<br> My favorite...<br> ...was one, two...<br> ...the third from the right...<br> ...because I thought it would go higher<br> than any other one.<br> So when everyone had gone home...<br> ...I'd swing.<br> It was just me and the swings.<br> I'd do a lot of thinking up here,<br> especially when I learned how to pump<br> I would go as high as I could go...<br> ...until I couldn't go any higher...<br> and then I would jump<br> Ah! And for a moment,<br> I would feel as free as a bird.<br> You should give it a whirl, Oskar.<br> It might change the way<br> you lack at things.<br> It's not safe.<br> You don't have to jump.<br> Can we go home now?<br> Fort Greene.<br> Fort Greene.<br> Fart Greene!<br> Fart Greene! Fart Greene!<br> Fart Greene! Fart Greene!<br> What are you doing?<br> - Hello. My name is Oskar Schell.<br> Did you know my father,<br> Thomas Schell?<br> - You are Abby Black?<br> - Uh, yeah.<br> I'm sure people<br> tell you this constantly...<br> ...but if you lack under<br> "incredibly beautiful" in the dictionary...<br> ...there's a picture of you.<br> Abby, I'm trying to say something here.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Would it be okay if I came in?<br> - New is really not a good time.<br> - Why not?<br> I'm in the middle of something.<br> I'm going upstairs to get this dune.<br> - Me tan.<br> - And you can do whatever...<br> What kind of something?<br> - Is that any of your business?<br> - Is that a rhetorical question?<br> I had to get in there.<br> I'm extremely thirsty!<br> Lie number seven.<br> What do you want to drink?<br> Iced coffee with half-and-half, please.<br> You coming?<br> I love this.<br> - So did I.<br> - Haw much do you know about elephants?<br> Hardly anything.<br> I know quite a lot<br> Loxodonta Africana<br> There's this woman who spent<br> the past 10 years in the Conga...<br> ...making recordings of elephant calls<br> to learn haw they communicate.<br> Abby! Where is everything?<br> This past year, she started to play them<br> back to the elephants.<br> What's fascinating<br> is that she played back...<br> ...the call of a dead elephant to family<br> members, and they remembered.<br> They approached the Jeep,<br> the speaker.<br> I wander what they were feeling<br> when they heard those calls.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm walking out of here.

Can I try it to see<br> if it fits something?<br> But it wasn't working.<br> Because people aren't like numbers.<br> They're more like letters.<br> And those letters<br> want to become stories.<br> And Dad said that stories<br> need to be shared.<br> That's it, leg, leg, leg, leg!<br> I had anticipated a six-minute visit<br> with each person named Black...<br> ...but they were never just six minutes.<br> Everyone took more time<br> than I had planned for...<br> ...to try and comfort me<br> and make me feel better about my dad.<br> And to tell me their stories.<br> But I didn't want to feel better<br> and I didn't want friends.<br> Tae Kwon Do, museum,<br> comic back convention.<br> I just wanted the lock.<br> Paint two five divided by 65...<br> ...156 days divided by 52<br> equals three years.<br> I wasn't getting any<br> closer to my dad.<br> I was losing him.<br> What are you, some kind of asshole?<br> Dickass!<br> Shiitake! All of you<br> in this stupid fukozowa building!<br> It must be a very confusing day.<br> I'll call you right back.<br> Message four, Septem...<br> Oskar, what's wrung?<br> Do you promise not to bury me<br> when I die?<br> It's the middle of the night, Oskar.<br> Do you promise not to bury me<br> when I die?<br> You are not going to die.<br> You are going to live a lung, long life.<br> You sure you love me?<br> Completely sure.<br> Then put me in one of those<br> mausoleum thingies above the ground.<br> Oh.<br> Okay, we need to talk.<br> About my mausoleum?<br> Na.<br> About what's been going an.<br> Why do you find it so hard<br> to talk to me?<br> In case you haven't noticed,<br> half the time, you're asleep.<br> And the other half the time,<br> you forget the first half.<br> You're what they call in the law<br> "in abstentia". An absent parent.<br> - That was mean.<br> - Which part?<br> All of it.<br> Dad used to say,<br> "The truth will set you free."<br> Well, Dad's not here.<br> - It's just the two of us.<br> - More like one and a quarter of us...<br> - ...to be mathematically accurate.<br> - Don't walk out of this roam, Oskar!<br> - What if I die tomorrow?<br> - You're not going to die tomorrow.<br> Dad didn't think he was<br> gonna die tomorrow either.<br> - It's not gonna happen to you.<br> - How do you know what's going to happen?<br> You know nothing.<br> You buried an empty box!<br> That's not the paint!<br> His memory is there!<br> It's exactly the point. Dad was just cells.<br> Now they're on rooftops, and the rivers...<br> Oskar!<br> ...And the lungs of millions of people<br> who breathe him every time they breathe!<br> - That's not haw it works!<br> - Haw do you know haw it works?<br> You don't know anything<br> about atoms or molecules.<br> He might even be part of the<br> dag shit in Central Park!<br> That is enough. Stop it.<br> Excuse me, dag feces.<br> - Stop it!<br> - But it's the truth!<br> Why can't I say the truth? Just because<br> Dad died doesn't mean you can be illogical.<br> - It has to make sense!<br> - Nat everything makes sense, Oskar!<br> There's not an answer for everything!<br> You're just stupid!<br> It's completely nonsensical!<br> It's just a box! An empty box!<br> I know it's an empty box! I know this.<br> But I did it for me, and I did it for you<br> so we could at least try...<br> ...and say goodbye to him...<br> ...because he's gone, Oskar,<br> he's gone and he's not coming back.<br> Never.<br> I don't know why a man flew a plane<br> into a building.<br> I don't know why my husband is dead.<br> But no matter haw you try, Oskar,<br> it's never gonna make sense...<br> ...because it doesn't,<br> it doesn't make sense!<br> Fukozowa you!<br> You don't know anything!<br> Why did you lie to me?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Where were you?<br> Where was I when?<br> That day, the worst day.<br> You know I was at work.<br> There was no one here.<br> I wish I had been.<br> But it wasn't possible.<br> You should've made it possible!<br> I can't make the impossible possible.<br> I wish it were you.<br> I wish it were you in the building<br> instead of him.<br> So do I.<br> I didn't really mean that.<br> Yes, you did.<br> Ga back to bed.<br> - Hey.<br> - Linda?<br> Yeah, I've been trying to reach you.<br> I'm an my way home.

What do you mean,<br> you're in the World Trade Center?<br> I had a meeting.<br> But I'm gonna be okay.<br> They're telling us to stay where we are.<br> We broke a window to let in some air.<br> Where are you?<br> I'm on the 106th? oor.<br> There's about 50 of us up here.<br> You...

We've been told to wait.<br> Thomas?<br> - That's what we got to do.<br> - Thomas...<br> Okay?<br> Na, it's not okay. Listen to me.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Thomas.<br> You need to listen to me.<br> Here's what you're gonna do.<br> You need to find a stairwell.<br> Do you hear me?<br> - Yes.<br> - Find the stairs and you came home.<br> Linda, honey, I've gotta go.<br> Other people need to use the phone.<br> I'm gonna be fine.<br> You're gonna be fine.<br> Stop saying that. Just find the stairs.<br> Linda, listen to me.<br> You do everything to make my life better.<br> I want you to know that<br> I absolutely love you.<br> I absolutely love you<br> Don't stop talking to me.<br> Just stay talking to me.<br> I'm gonna try to call you again<br> in a few min...<br> Please, just stay talking to me...<br> This is unconfirmed,<br> but we are getting information...<br> ...from an employee<br> of United Airlines.<br> Again, we want to emphasize this is<br> unconfirmed, but there is speculation...<br> Grandma, are you awake?<br> Over.<br> Grandma, please wake up. Over.<br> Please.<br> Over.<br> Grandma?<br> I know someone is in there.<br> I won't hurt you. I'm only 4 years old.<br> Lie number 64.<br> Who are you?<br> I'm Oskar Schell, Grandma's grandson.<br> Do you know where my grandma is?<br> Out this time of night?<br> Do you know where?<br> It's kind of a matter of life and death.<br> Are you a stranger?<br> Technically?<br> I wouldn't go into a stranger's bedroom.<br> Haw came you don't speak?<br> Are your vocal cards<br> damaged or something?<br> Or did something scare you to death?<br> Coal.<br> When was the last time you spake?<br> Do you ever try to talk?<br> Why don't you try to say<br> something to me?<br> Ga an.<br> "My name is the Renter."<br> Do you have a criminal record?<br> Mm. Maybe you hurt people for a living?<br> Well, what's your story then?<br> I had to tell someone.<br> I couldn't keep it a secret any more.<br> Can I tell you my story?<br> My father died at 9/11.<br> After he died, I wouldn't go<br> into his roam for a year...<br> ...because it was tan hard<br> and it always made me wanna cry.<br> But one day, I had completely heavy<br> boots and I went into his room anyway.<br> I miss doing Tae Kwon Do with him<br> because it made me laugh.<br> When I went into his closet<br> where his clothes and stuff were...<br> ...I reached up to get his old camera<br> with the brawn case...<br> -and I broke a blue vase.<br> Inside was an envelope<br> with "Black" written on it.<br> And I knew that Dad had left something...<br> ...somewhere for me<br> that the key opened and I had to find<br> So I take it to Walt the locksmith-<br> - I get from Stan the doorman...<br> Some kind of lockbox<br> -for all the five boroughs.<br> I count there are 472 people<br> with the last name "Black."<br> There are 215 different addresses.<br> Some of the Blacks live together, obviously.<br> I calculate if I go to two<br> every Saturday plus holidays...<br> ...minus my Hamlet school play rehearsals,<br> it'll take me about three years...<br> ...ta go through all of them. But that's what I'll do.<br> Ga to every person named Black...<br> ...and find out what the key fits<br> and what Dad needed me to find.<br> The very best possible plan.<br> I divided the people by zones and<br> I really had to tell my mother another lie.<br> She wouldn't understand<br> haw I need to find what the key fit...<br> ...that would help me<br> make sense of things...<br> ...like him being killed by people<br> who didn't even know him at all!<br> And I see some people<br> who don't speak English...<br> Hazelle Black, who's all prayered up<br> and spake to Gad.<br> If she spoke to God, how come she<br> didn't tell him not to kill her son...<br> ...not to let people<br> fly planes into buildings<br> Maybe she spake to a different Gad<br> than them!<br> I meet a man, who is a woman who<br> is a man, a woman all at the same time<br> I didn't wanna get near him/her,<br> because she/he scared me...<br> ...because she/he was so different.<br> I still wandered if she had a VJ<br> or penicillin, but what does it matter?<br> What would this place be like<br> if everybody had the same haircut?<br> I see Mr. Black, who hasn't heard<br> a sound in 24 years.<br> Which I can understand,<br> because I miss Dad's voice that much.<br> Like when he would say<br> "Are you up yet?" or...<br> Let's go do something.<br> I see the twin brothers<br> who paint together.<br> And there's a shed that just has<br> to be a clue, but it's just a shed!<br> And Astrid Black,<br> who has the same drawing...<br> ...of the same person<br> over and over and over again!<br> Boris Black, the doorman, who was once<br> a schoolteacher in Russia...<br> ...but now says his brain is dying.<br> Ramos Black, who has a coin collection...<br> ...but doesn't have enough money<br> to eat every day!<br> Alan Black has a view of Gramercy Park<br> but not a key to it...<br> ...which he says is worse<br> than looking at a brick wall.<br> I feel like I'm looking<br> at a brick wall...<br> ...because I tried the key<br> in 148 different places...<br> ...but the key didn't fit<br> and open anything Dad needed me to find.<br> So that I'd know without him<br> everything is all right.<br> Then let's leave it there.<br> I still feel scared every time<br> I go into a strange place.<br> I'm so scared I have to hold myself around<br> my waist or I think I'll just break apart!<br> But I never forget what I heard him<br> tell Mam about the Sixth Borough:<br> That if things were easy to find...<br> They wouldn't be worth finding.<br> But I'm still scared every time I leave<br> home, every time I hear a door open.<br> And I don't know a single thing<br> that I didn't know when I started...<br> ...except I miss my dad<br> more than ever...<br> ...even though the whale paint<br> was to stop missing him at all!<br> It hurts tan much.<br> Sometimes I think I might do<br> something really bad.<br> Like you to what?<br> No way. Absolutely not. No, no, no.<br> Sure.
