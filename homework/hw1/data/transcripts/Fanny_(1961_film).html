"<br> Now it will be terrible,<br> you'll see.<br> "I couldn't write before"<br> "because we had problems<br> upon arriving in Port Sad. "<br> "A sailor died"<br> "the authorities found<br> it was fever,<br> We stayed in quarantine. "<br> The plague, can you imagine?<br> A plague on his boat!<br> once a friend of his had mumps,<br> so he stayed home for keeping him safe.<br> And now he was swimming in the plague!<br> In fever to the neck.<br> - But he did not have it?<br> - Oh, Marius!<br> always has your fears and thoughts<br> Okay, continue.<br> "Doctors took samples from the dead<br> "And they said<br> it was not the plague.

"<br> "But you do not lean too far to<br> measure the seabed "<br> "you may fall."<br> "And where is very deep,<br> let others measure. "<br> I know Marius.<br> One day I took him to fishing<br> on Panisse's boat.<br> and he fell into the sea.<br> I must say that his head<br> is heavier than the rear<br> After he changed course.<br> Where are we?<br> Reread the last sentence.<br> "Let other measure."<br> Yes Underline "Others"<br> very strong.<br> "And if someone has a fever"<br> "Talk to him from far<br> and do not go near by ,<br> "even if<br> he's your best friend.
