Your<br> father and I are going out,<br> and I need you to<br> look after your sister.<br> Aw, shucks. Now move out of<br> the way so Mother can park.<br> Sherry Seeger says they only<br> cost five or six dollars.<br> Please, Mother. Please, can I?<br> Oh, Sybil, thank heavens. Well, I<br> knew you were going to the grocery.<br> David, please help Sybil unload the car.<br> How come Janice doesn't<br> got to? Doesn't have to.<br> Because Janice is carrying<br> in all her belongings...<br> and marching straight<br> upstairs into a bath.<br> Your father and I have an engagement tonight,<br> so I want you to have a nice early dinner.<br> And help Sybil. Yes, ma'am.<br> Sybil, did Mr. Whitaker call while I<br> was out? Not since youve been gone.<br> How do you like that guy?<br> Mother, can I please get them?<br> Janice, I said we'd discuss it with<br> your father. Now hurry on inside.<br> David, put your bike away<br> and help with the groceries.<br> Where's your jacket? It's inside.<br> Well, hello, stranger.<br> Aren't I seeing you in about<br> three hours' time? You are.<br> But I just left the caterers<br> and I had to dash over.<br> Oh, you have the samples? You bet.<br> Oh, come inside. You<br> just caught me actually.<br> I could only stay a second.<br> I still have loads to do.<br> David, what did I tell you?<br> I'm getting the last bag.<br> And imagine with the<br> table setting I showed you.<br> The aqua trim. Is that smart? Oh, yes.<br> You like? Mm-hmm.<br> Well, I'll call the caterer in the morning,<br> you confirm with Dorothy on the deposit...<br> and, honey, we're in business.<br> Magnatech '57, here we come. You betcha.<br> Thanks for stopping by,<br> El. I'll see you at 8:00.<br> You know Frank--<br> on the dot.<br> Mother?

This is the<br> Hartford Police Department...<br> calling for a Mrs. Frank Whitaker.<br> Who is it? The police department.<br> Hello?<br> Yes, am I speaking with a<br> Mrs. Frank Whitaker? Yes.<br> One moment, please.<br> Cathy? Oh, Frank.<br> Are you all right? What<br> happened? Everything's fine.<br> It was all just<br> a big mix up--<br> the whole thing.<br> But you have to come get me. They<br> wont let me leave on my own.<br> Oh, Frank, don't worry, darling.<br> I'll be there as soon as I can.<br> Is there anything I<br> can do, Mrs. Whitaker?<br> Just keep an eye on the children,<br> please. I don't think I'll be very long.<br> Big time faggot. Family<br> man. Never can tell.<br> Say, get a load of this one. You<br> don't see that every day of the week.<br> This is your copy,<br> ma'am, and your receipt.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, Frank.<br> I tell you<br> one thing--<br> if it hadn't been for<br> that snivelling junior cop,<br> they would have never gone through<br> this whole charade in the first place.<br> Instead of trying to save face-- I saw that<br> guy that they were after, that loiterer.<br> But they wouldnt listen to me.<br> So, there were drinks after work?<br> What do you mean? They said something,<br> intoxication level, something--<br> Christ, I had one lousy cocktail with<br> Bill after work going over the portfolio.<br> Should I be arrested for that<br> too? No, of course not, darling.<br> The whole thing has just<br> put me in a foul state.<br> He's fine. Oh, the car's fine.<br> Frank says it was the<br> bumper that got hit.<br> But you know me, I can't<br> tell the difference.<br> Oh, I'm just sorry we had to miss it.<br> She was fine.<br> Said it was all a dreadful<br> bore, what with Mona Lauder...<br> and her gossip.

Thank you.<br> I suppose we may as well get started.<br> Actually, uh, Mrs. Whitaker,<br> I think it might be best...<br> if your husband and I<br> conversed in private.<br> In private. Yes, of course.<br> I think it would be<br> best. Certainly, Doctor.<br> I'll see you later.<br> I'll see you later, dear.<br> Today, the general attitude<br> regarding this sort of behavior...<br> is naturally more modern,<br> more scientific than<br> it ever has been before.<br> But for those who do seek treatment,<br> who possess the will and desire...<br> to lead a normal life,<br> there still remains only a scant...<br> five to thirty percent<br> rate of success...<br> for complete heterosexual conversion.<br> For many, it's the treatment itself...<br> that often changes the patient's mind.<br> What does it, uh, comprise of?<br> - The treatment.<br> - The treatment's comprised of psychiatric sessions...<br> twice a week, sometimes more.<br> Just talking? Yes.<br> Though some patients have explored<br> additional, more behavioural methods.<br> - Behavioural?<br> - Electroshock aversion therapy for instance.<br> Or hormonal rebalancing procedures.<br> I know this can all seem<br> rather daunting at first.<br> I suggest you take some time.<br> Think over the various<br> options we've discussed.<br> Discuss it with your<br> wife. No, I already know.<br> I want to begin treatment.<br> I can't let this thing...<br> destroy my life,<br> my family's life.<br> I, uh-- I-I know<br> it's a sickness,<br> because it makes me feel...<br> despicable.<br> I promise you, Dr. Bowman,<br> I'm going to beat this thing.<br> I'm gonna break it.<br> So help me God.<br> Why don't you confirm those<br> times we discussed with Rosalyn.<br> I'll see you here same time<br> next Tuesday. Thank you, Doctor.<br> Mr. Whitaker, Mrs.<br> Whitaker. Thank you, Doctor.<br> Frank? What?<br> I'm just proud of you, that's all.<br> Don't say that. Well, I am.<br> He seems a very decent man,<br> Dr. Bowman. Dont you think?<br> Frank? I don't know, Cathleen.<br> I suppose he's decent.<br> But you must have liked him<br> enough to want to see him again.<br> Who else am I going to see?<br> Well, I'm sure there are numerous doctors<br> in Hartford or Springfield if you--<br> Look, I just want to get the<br> whole fucking thing over with!<br> Can you understand that?<br> Frank, please don't.<br> I-I'm sorry.<br> All right, Cathy, I'm so sorry.<br> Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. Morning.<br> Morning.<br> Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. Hi, Kitty.<br> I hope you have a pleasant<br> day, sir. Thank you.<br> Good morning, Mr. Whitaker. Marlene.<br> I found this in the<br> cupboard, sir. What's that?<br> Your office lamp-- the<br> one that was missing.<br> Ah-- Should I have<br> it repaired, sir?<br> Yes. Yes, thank you, Marlene.<br> Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Fine's been waiting.<br> Frank? Uh?<br> I didn't see you sitting there.<br> Everything all right?<br> Oh, with me? Of course.<br> What's up? Just picked up<br> the galleys from the printer.<br> How do they look? Great, just great.<br> Just leave them there. I'll<br> take a look first chance I get.<br> Sure.<br> You'll let me know what you think?<br> Of course I will.<br> You're first on my list.<br> What's it gonna take to get<br> you back on that course anyway?<br> We haven't seen you for weeks. I know.<br> Sunday. No excuses.<br> All right. I'll hold you to it.<br> Thanks again, El. You sure<br> that's all I can give you?<br> Oh, yes. The caterer should have everything.<br> I just thought a few extras would be nice.<br> Oh, don't forget. The art show is<br> Saturday. Start working on Frank tonight.<br> I swear he's the kind of man<br> you have to pin messages to.<br> Though I'm sorry to say,<br> Mona Lauder will be attending.<br> Turns out her uncle's in town, some<br> hotshot art dealer from New York.<br> I think I met him at<br> one of Mona's soirees.<br> A bit flowery for my taste.<br> How do you mean? Oh, you know,<br> a touch light on his feet.<br> Oh, you mean-- Yes,<br> darling, he's one of those.<br> Of course, I could be mistaken.<br> Just an impression I got.<br> You don't care for them particularly?<br> Well, no, not particularly.<br> Not that I actually know any.<br> Call me old-fashioned, I just like<br> all the men I'm around to be all men.<br> Say, why the third degree?<br> It's not the third degree.<br> I'm just interested,<br> that's all, in your views.<br> I read an article in a magazine.<br> What? Nothing.<br> I'm just delighted to see you taking<br> interest in yet another civic cause.<br> I can see it now.<br> "Cathleen Whitaker and her<br> kindness to homosexuals."<br> Ugh. That word.<br> See you Saturday-- and<br> bring Frank. I'll try.<br> Then Billy Hutchinson stole<br> a pass at the ten-yard line.<br> Ran it all the way for a touchdown.<br> You should a seen it, Pop.<br> Father, want to see my<br> routine for the ballet recital?<br> Hey, I was talking to Pop. Children, give<br> your father a moment to eat his dinner.<br> Would you like another lamb chop, dear?<br> Oh, I'm fine. Are you sure?<br> I have plenty in the<br> oven. No, thank you.<br> I'm, I'm fine.<br> We're playing Lincoln on Saturday,<br> Pop-- if youre not working.<br> That reminds me. This Saturday is the reception<br> for the modern art show I told you about,<br> the one that Eleanor's<br> group is sponsoring.<br> Oh, God. I know how you hate these<br> things, but I simply have to go.<br> - Eleanor pleaded with me to ask you.<br> - Wait, what about me?<br> No one cares one bit<br> what I'm doing Saturday.<br> David, I'm sorry.<br> But this Saturday your mother has an<br> engagement that simply cannot be changed.<br> Well, Pop could come.<br> Couldnt you, Pop? Well see, David.<br> Janice, could you<br> please pass the butter?<br> Thank you.<br> President Eisenhower was determined<br> to keep the troops there until--<br> ...satisfactory or<br> unequivocal assurances that--<br> Frank?<br> Hmm?<br> Did you see him?<br> Yeah.<br> You didn't say a word.<br> So how did it go with Bowman?<br> Did you feel--<br> It was fine.<br> And there's nothing else you care to<br> share with your very own adoring wife?<br> Cathleen, what I discuss<br> with this doctor--<br> it's private, all right.<br> - That's part of it.<br> - Oh, I understand, darling.<br> I do.<br> Oh-- Frank, wait till you<br> see the hors d'oeuvres.<br> The caterer's doing, just<br> such a marvellous job.<br> I think youre going to be so<br> pleased this year, darling. I really do.<br> Eleanor, darling, I'm so sorry I'm late.<br> Cathleen, darling. Hello, Mona.<br> Uh, I want to introduce you<br> to my uncle, Morris Farnsworth,<br> that wickedly successful<br> Gotham art dealer...<br> who was kind enough to attend<br> our provincial little gathering.<br> Morris, darling, allow<br> me to introduce you...<br> to my dear little<br> friend, Cathleen Whitaker,<br> whose face and civic fancies<br> are hardly strangers...<br> to the society pages of Hartford.<br> Oh, Mona. Really, you must<br> ignore her, Mr. Farnsworth.<br> Charmed. I do hope you enjoy your stay.<br> Morris was just telling us<br> the most delightful tale...<br> all about a forged Rembrandt.<br> Cathy, don't let us keep you. I know you<br> want to see the show. I am dying to see it.<br> Oh, yes, dear, simply charming.<br> Eleanor, you should be<br> so proud. Thank you, Mona.<br> It was lovely to meet you, Mr.<br> Farnsworth. Likewise, my dear.<br> Wife of Hartford executive...<br> communing with Picasso?<br> Mrs. Leacock, it's<br> lovely to see you again.<br> And how is that charming<br> husband of yours?<br> Oh, he's very well. Thank you.<br> Um, would you excuse me just a moment?<br> Oh, certainly, dear. Thank you.<br> Raymond, what a tremendous<br> surprise finding you here.<br> Mrs. Whitaker, hello.<br> Is this your daughter?<br> Yep, this is my Sarah.<br> Hello, Sarah. Hello.<br> -Bobby, get over here!<br> - Say, Sarah,<br> isn't that Hutch and his little<br> brother I see playing out front?<br> You remember them, dont you, baby?<br> Oh, sure you do.<br> The day we went to the Hutchinson house.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> What do you say you go out and see<br> if theyd like to play for a while?<br> Ah, go on.<br> For Daddy?<br> Attagirl.<br> Oh, Raymond, she's lovely. Thank you.<br> Well, how on Earth did you<br> find out about this show?<br> Well, I do read the papers.<br> W-- No, of course you do.<br> I just meant that it's-- it's<br> such a-- it's a coincidence.<br> I know. I was just teasing you.<br> Because, you know, I'm not prejudiced.<br> My husband and I have always believed<br> in equal rights for the Negro...<br> and support the N.A.A.C.P.<br> I'm glad to hear that.<br> I just wanted you to<br> know. Well, thank you.<br> Oh, not at all.<br> Go!<br> Straighter, Tommy! You<br> got to throw it straighter.<br> And hard. One, two, three, go!<br> It's too heavy..<br> What? On the back. Your airplane.<br> Who asked you? Come on, Bobby.<br> So, what's your opinion on modern art?<br> Uh, it's hard to put into words really.<br> I-I just know what I care<br> for, and, and what I don't.<br> Like this-- I don't<br> know how to pronounce it.<br> "Mira"? Mir.<br> Mir.<br> I don't know why, but I just adore it.<br> A feeling it gives.<br> I know that sounds terribly vague.<br> No, no, actually it confirms something I've<br> always wondered about modern art, abstract art.<br> What is that?<br> That perhaps it's just picking<br> up where religious art left off,<br> somehow trying to show you divinity.<br> The modern artist just pares it down to<br> the basic elements of shape and color.<br> But when you look at that Mir,<br> you feel it just the same.<br> Why, that's lovely, Raymond.<br> T o tell the truth, I've always<br> preferred the work of the Masters.<br> Rembrandt,<br> Michelangelo--<br> Would you excuse me a<br> moment? Oh, certainly.<br> Cathleen-- Oh, El, honey,<br> everything looks just marvellous.<br> Cathy, who on Earth is that man? You<br> have this whole place in a clamour.<br> For heaven sakes why? Because<br> of that ridiculous story?<br> Who is he?<br> He's Raymond Deagan, Otis Deagan's son.<br> Your gardener? He passed away and<br> Raymond's taken over his business.<br> You certainly seem on<br> familiar terms with him.<br> Oh, "familiar terms"--<br> What does that mean?<br> He happens to have some very<br> interesting views on Mir.<br> Oh, jeepers, look at the time. I have to fly.<br> I'm having the carpets cleaned for tomorrow--<br> What time are the caterers<br> showing? They said 4:00.<br> I'll come early, for moral<br> support. You're a doll.<br> So glad you could make<br> it. Come in. Come in.<br> Not to say that I'm against<br> integration, mind you.<br> I do believe it's the<br> Christian thing to do.<br> But I still say what<br> happened in Little Rock...<br> could just as easily have<br> happened here in Hartford.<br> - Nonsense.<br> - Well, why is that?<br> Well, for one thing, there's no<br> Governor Faubus in Connecticut.<br> But the main reason,<br> there are no Negroes.<br> No, but there are some...<br> rather dangerous pro-integration<br> types right here in Hartford.<br> Dangerous? Oh, yes.<br> Some very attractive ones, in fact,<br> noted, I'm told, for<br> their kindness to Negroes.<br> Oh, Dick, stop. Where on<br> Earth did you hear about that?<br> Shirley read it to me.<br> I should have known.<br> - What's all this?<br> - Absolutely nothing.<br> Now, let me freshen those.<br> Excuse me, please. Thanks.<br> Oh, by golly, there she is now,<br> the "purist" gal in the room.<br> Oh, Stan, liquor brings out the Texan<br> in you. I hope Eleanor isn't listening.<br> So what if she is. I still say<br> Frank is the luckiest guy in town.<br> Hear! Hear! It's all smoke and<br> mirrors, fells. That's all it is.<br> You should see her without her face on.<br> - Frank!<br> -No, he's absolutely right.<br> We ladies are never what we appear,<br> and every girl as her secrets.<br> I'll say. How about this girl<br> getting her husband another drink?<br> Darling, dont you think<br> you've already had enough?<br> No, I don't think<br> I've had enough--<br> I'd just like to take a moment to raise a<br> glass to our marvellous host and hostess...<br> and another glorious annual<br> party at the Whitakers.<br> To Frank and Cathy, truly<br> Mr. and Mrs. Magnatech.<br> Hear! Hear!<br> My goodness. Thank you very much.<br> Now, who can I freshen<br> up? Ron? No, I'm fine.<br> Me. Oh, I think youre fresh enough.<br> All right.<br> Here, Mrs. Whitaker,<br> let me take that for you.<br> Thank you, Sybil.<br> Cathy? Hi.<br> Honey, is everything all right?<br> Why? What do you mean?<br> Frank-- I've never<br> seen him so soused.<br> Oh, he's been working so hard<br> lately. He's under tremendous strain.<br> You sure that's all? Oh, yes.<br> You'd tell me if there was<br> anything more? Of course I would.<br> Well, Cathy,<br> I think we just threw ourselves one class<br> -"A" swanky function.<br> It did turn out nicely, didn't it?<br> Cathleen, darling, you've simply<br> outdone yourself once again.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Frank?<br> Well, if I do say so myself,<br> it was a lovely party,<br> all considering.<br> I just wish...<br> it didn't have to turn ugly...<br> in front of our friends.<br> Honestly, Frank, if<br> you didn't insist on--<br> What is it?<br> Oh, Frank.<br> Oh, Jesus.<br> Oh, Jesus! What's<br> happening? I can't even--<br> God! Frank, it doesn't matter.<br> The important thing is to<br> keep, to keep trying. Don't!<br> What?<br> Because--<br> I'm sure, you know,<br> Dick Dawson wouldn't mind lending<br> his services every once in a while.<br> Oh, Frank.<br> I mean, you wouldn't mind<br> that so much, would you?<br> A good-looking guy like Dick.<br> Maybe even Stan would pitch in.<br> Frank, you're the only<br> man that I've ever wanted.<br> Just let go. Frank,<br> Frank, you're--<br> You're all men to me. You're all man.<br> Stop it!<br> Cathy. Cathy, I'm sorry. Oh.<br> I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.<br> It's all right. I'm-I'm all right.<br> It was an accident. Are you bleeding?<br> Oh, just--just<br> the littlest bit.<br> Perhaps, um, you could<br> get me some ice, dear.<br> Some ice? Yes.<br> Cathy--<br> I-I know.<br> Uh, um, it's all right. I'm all right.<br> Hey, there, hon. Listen. I can't stay.<br> I'm meeting Stan for lunch at the club.<br> Oh, that sounds like fun. Can't believe<br> I let you get away without these.<br> It's cute, your hair that way. Oh, yeah?<br> I experimented. Oh, it's adorable.<br> Thanks. Oh. Whoopsie.<br> Thanks.<br> Cathy. What?<br> What happened to your head?<br> Oh, nothing. I--<br> I hit the door.<br> It was the silliest thing.<br> Cathy. What?<br> Did something happen<br> between you and Frank?<br> What do you mean?<br> Cathy, I'm your best friend.<br> Nothing happened.<br> Nothing at all.<br> Oh, Cathy.<br> Eleanor.<br> Cathy, I'm your dearest and<br> closest friend in the world.<br> You call me--<br> day or night.<br> You hear?<br> Mrs. Whitaker?<br> Is there anything I can do?<br> You sure?<br> I'm-- I'm fine.<br> I just,<br> um--<br> I-It's a difficult<br> time with my husband.<br> Oh. It happens with married people.<br> I know it does. Im just--<br> Its just embarrassing.<br> Please forgive me. Forgive you?<br> Mrs. Whitaker, listen.<br> I have to pick up some shrubs<br> from a farmhouse just out of town.<br> Which means I gotta get a move on.<br> Why don't you come along for the ride?<br> Some fresh air, change of scenery...<br> might help you take your mind of things.<br> Ooh. Oh,<br> no. I, uh--<br> I couldn't.<br> Uh--<br> Thank you, Raymond, for offering.<br> You're very kind.<br> You sure? Mrs. Whitaker?<br> Oh. Yes, Sybil? It's<br> Mrs. Barker on the phone.<br> I'll be right there! Oh.<br> Mm. I have to get back.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, not at all. Um, well, I-- I was<br> planning on picking them up at 5:00.<br> You'd like to switch for Thursday?<br> I don't see why that would be a problem.<br> Um, No. I'm glad I could be of help.<br> Certainly.<br> Bye now.<br> Raymond. Mrs. Whitaker.<br> Hi. Hello.<br> Oh, wouldnt you know it. I just received<br> a call and suddenly everything's changed.<br> Anyway,<br> I--<br> You changed your mind.<br> Well, good.<br> Thank you very much,<br> Mr. Deagan. Thank you.<br> Oh, it's lovely. What is it?<br> Hamamelis-- well, flowering witch<br> hazel. Fairly rare in these parts.<br> It's beautiful.<br> You were right. What a<br> perfectly lovely spot.<br> Is that a path?<br> I think so.<br> Let's have a peek. All right.<br> Sometimes it's the people<br> outside our world...<br> we confide in best.<br> But once you do...<br> confide, share with someone,<br> they're no longer<br> really outside, are they?<br> Oh. Look!<br> How lovely.<br> Did he cause that?<br> He didn't mean to strike me.<br> I am so sorry.<br> No. Heaven knows we<br> all have our troubles.<br> I'm sure you,<br> yourself--<br> What?<br> I don't know. Ever since running<br> into you at the exhibition,<br> I kept wondering what it must be like...<br> to be the only one in a room.<br> Colored or...<br> whatever it was.<br> How that might possibly feel.<br> I'm sure I've--<br> I've never--<br> Well,<br> I suppose you sort of grow<br> accustomed to it over time.<br> I mean, don't get me wrong.<br> There is a world, even here in Hartford,<br> where everybody does<br> indeed look like me.<br> Trouble is, very few people<br> ever leave that world.<br> I only want what every<br> father wants for his child.<br> The opportunities growing<br> up I never had. Naturally.<br> But I tell you something. If<br> youre really interested-- Oh, I am.<br> You hungry? I mean,<br> could you eat something?<br> I suppose I could. Tell you what,<br> I'm gonna take you to<br> one of my favourite spots.<br> On good days, it's got<br> hot food, cold drink,<br> and just about discernable music.<br> It's hard to beat that. There you go.<br> Say, who's green Edsel? Yoo-hoo.<br> Yoo-hoo. Here I am.<br> Oh. There you are, ma'am.<br> Let me get that for you.<br> Oh. Thank you very much indeed.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Let me help you with that,<br> ma'am. Oh. Thanks very much.<br> Blues ]<br> Thank you. I'm hardly<br> dressed for a restaurant.<br> You look fine.<br> Raymond. Don't worry.<br> This is a very friendly place.<br> Say there, Esther.<br> What, you can't say hello anymore?<br> Looks like you speakin'<br> just fine for yourself.<br> Oh, now you just sore because I haven't<br> been coming around like I used to.<br> Is that so? Mm-hmm.<br> Now what do you say about bringing<br> us over a couple of drinks?<br> What would you like? Oh,<br> uh, a daiquiri if they--<br> One daiquiri and a bourbon on the rocks.<br> Thank you, doll.<br> What do you think you're doing, boy?<br> Thank you.<br> Well, I hope youre<br> finding this very amusing.<br> What do you mean? This<br> is a very welcoming place.<br> How you doing', Gus?<br> See what I mean?<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you, Esther.<br> Here's to being the only one.<br> You know, we don't have to stay here.<br> If you feel uncomfortable-- No.<br> As long as I stay away from Esther,<br> I think I'll be fine.<br> All right then.<br> <br> Thank you, Raymond,<br> for a lovely afternoon.<br> No. Thank you, Mrs. Whitaker.<br> I've had one as well.<br> Mrs. Whitaker sounds<br> so formal. Would you--<br> Would I what?<br> Ask me to dance?<br> <br> Oh. That looks<br> wonderful. Now, let's see.<br> Where should we put it?<br> Oh. I know. Right there.<br> Right by the window.<br> Yes.<br> Yes. That's lovely. It certainly is.<br> Oh. Now, let's see.<br> Where did I put that list?<br> Although I promised Janice that I<br> wouldn't be late for her recital.<br> Can't miss that.<br> Sybil, I've been meaning<br> to ask you-- Yes, ma'am?<br> What's the name of that<br> church group you belong to?<br> The one you mentioned to<br> me. You mean, at Ebenezer?<br> The Baptist group? Yes.<br> I believe that's it.<br> Or was it South Green Baptist during<br> the fair drive, the Ladies Auxiliary?<br> Oh. I didn't know<br> there was more than one.<br> Yes. I always seem to be<br> signing up for something.<br> I think that's marvellous, Sybil, that<br> you find the time with all you do for us.<br> I just have so much in the attic<br> I've been meaning to go through.<br> I thought you might know of a<br> church or civic organization...<br> that could use a donation.<br> Well, certainly, Mrs. Whitaker, if<br> thats what youre looking for.<br> Places in need are never hard<br> to find. I'm sure youre right.<br> Oh! My. Hello. May I help you?<br> Good afternoon, ma'am.<br> Allow me to introduce myself.<br> My name's Reginald Carter<br> and this is Martha Livingston.<br> We're members of the Hartford Branch...<br> of the National Association for<br> the Advancement of Colored People.<br> Oh, well, certainly, I am<br> familiar with your organization.<br> Perhaps you'd be interested in reading<br> over our complimentary brochure.<br> Mm. Yes. I would. If you<br> wouldn't mind signing our roster--<br> I'm running so terribly late as it is.<br> Sybil, would you mind<br> signing for me? Yes, ma'am.<br> Thank you.<br> <br> Mother! Hello, dear.<br> - Did the recital just begin?<br> - Shh!<br> So where are the other<br> little girls from your class?<br> Over there.<br> Janice. Janice!<br> Sybil?<br> Hello. Cathy?<br> El? Oh, Cathy. Thank heavens you're<br> home. I've been trying you all day.<br> El, what is it? So you haven't<br> heard? You haven't heard a thing?<br> No. What happened? Oh, Cathy.<br> There's been talk. Vicious talk.<br> What do you mean? About what? About you?<br> Oh, for heaven sake. What<br> now? Honey. It's Mona, Cathy.<br> She's-- Well, she's just<br> been on some kind of rampage,<br> swearing up and down that she saw you and<br> a colored man somewhere out on Franklin.<br> Getting out of a truck<br> or some such thing.<br> The same colored man she claims<br> you were talking to at the art show.<br> Eleanor, that's--<br> that's preposterous.<br> I mean, yes, I've spoken to Mr. Deagan on<br> occasion, but this makes it sound like--<br> I know. You have no idea what<br> it's been like around here.<br> The phone has been ringing off<br> the hook since 8:00 this morning.<br> - Eleanor, the entire situation is so absurd.<br> - Darling, I know.<br> What in the world am I supposed to do?<br> I suppose you could start by<br> getting yourself another gardener.<br> Frank? What on Earth-- Eleanor, could<br> I call you back? Frank just walked in.<br> Of course. You go ahead.<br> I'll call you later.<br> Frank?<br> What are you doing home?<br> Is everything all right?<br> Just tell me one goddamned thing. What?<br> Is it true, what they've been saying?<br> Frank, I can't<br> believe you even--<br> Because if it is, even in the<br> slightest, I swear to God, Cathleen--<br> Frank, I am sorry you even<br> had to hear such nonsense.<br> Yeah, well, Dick Dawson didn't seem<br> to think it was such nonsense...<br> when he snuck away from<br> his desk to phone me today.<br> Good heavens. He says the<br> whole friggin' town's talking!<br> Frank, please. Sybil will hear you.<br> I sent her out!<br> Christ, Cathleen, do you even have the<br> slightest idea about what this could mean?<br> Dont you realize the<br> effect it's gonna have on me...<br> and the reputation I have spent the<br> past eight years trying to build...<br> for you and the children<br> and for the company?<br> Frank, I swear to you, whatever<br> Mona Lauder saw or thought she saw...<br> was entirely a figment of that<br> woman's hateful imagination.<br> Yes. I have spoken to<br> Raymond Deagan on occasion.<br> He brought his little girl to Eleanor's<br> art show. But-- But, apparently,<br> even here in Hartford, the idea of a white<br> woman even speaking to a colored man--<br> Oh, please! Just save<br> me the Negro rights!<br> You know what that woman is capable of!.<br> And besides, I-I've<br> already given him notice...<br> and we-- we won't be<br> seeing that man again.<br> Fine.<br> Is that why you came home--<br> because of what Dick said?<br> Did something happen at work?<br> Frank.<br> Tsk. I guess you could call it<br> some sort of early Christmas bonus.<br> What do you mean?<br> A month of rest and relaxation.<br> Can you imagine? During the<br> busiest season of the year.<br> What a goddamn honour.<br> But when you consider the<br> bang-up job I've been doing...<br> ever since good ol' Dr.<br> Bowman came on the scene--<br> and for being-- What<br> did Millstein call it?<br> "Years overdue."<br> They do owe you a vacation<br> after all you've given them.<br> Palm Springs is supposed to be nice.<br> So says the word on high.<br> I know it may not seem like it now,<br> but a little time away, a vacation,<br> might be the best thing...<br> for both of us.<br> Frank, what a wretched day<br> it must have been for you.<br> Say, what do you know? Pop's<br> home. What you doing' home, Pop?<br> David, your father has work to do.<br> It's best you help yourself to a glass<br> of milk and get started on your studies.<br> Yes, Mother. Say, Pop--<br> Mind your mother, David.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Uh, say, Mr.<br> Deagan-- Yes, Jake?<br> There's a lady on the phone<br> for you. I'll be right there.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Thank you for meeting me. I<br> realize you have a busy schedule.<br> Worked out fine. I was glad you called.<br> Are you sure everything's all right?<br> Uh, is there something<br> I can do for you folks?<br> Can we leave here? Of course.<br> What is it? What happened?<br> I wanted to see you<br> in person, Raymond. I--<br> I just--<br> I can't.<br> Can't what?<br> It isn't plausible for<br> me to be friends with you.<br> You've been so very kind to me and I've been<br> perfectly reckless and foolish in return,<br> thinking--<br> Thinking what?<br> That one person could<br> reach out to another,<br> take an interest in another...<br> and maybe for one fleeting instant...<br> could manage to see beyond the surface,<br> beyond the color of things?<br> Do you think we ever really do...<br> see beyond<br> those things--<br> the surface of things?<br> "Just beyond the fall of grace,<br> behold that ever-shining place."<br> Yes. I do.<br> I don't really have a choice.<br> I wish I could.<br> Good luck to you, Raymond.<br> Mrs. Whitaker. You! Boy!<br> Hands off!.<br> - Yeah!

My goodness.<br> I knew I was forgetting something.<br> A little something<br> for Mr. and Mrs. Claus.<br> Well, what have we here?<br> "Bermuda."<br> "Acapulco. Rio.<br> Miami." Take your<br> pick. It's your choice.<br> Mother, will you help<br> me lace up my slippers?<br> In a minute, dear. I don't know.<br> Stan is always raving about Miami.<br> Oh, Frank. Miami would be a dream.<br> El says it's just<br> darling. Everything's pink.<br> Oh, really? Hmm.<br> Maybe we oughta consider Bermuda.<br> Oh, Frank! I do love you, darling.<br> Mwah. I do.<br> <br> I must say, you look<br> extremely fetching...<br> all gussied up in<br> your white tux and tie.<br> Well, it's a good thing, since<br> I can hardly breathe in it.<br> Oh. It's not that bad.<br> You like my dress? Why, yes.<br> Very much. Didn't I say?<br> You did not. Well, it's<br> a ravishing dress...<br> with a ravishing girl to go with it.<br> That's more like it.<br> Very nice.<br> Right this way, sir.<br> Hilda, we're over here.<br> Ah. Excuse us. No problem at all.<br> <br> You have a lovely family. Thank you.<br> Have a Happy New Year. Happy New Year.<br> Oh, Kenny, be a darling and<br> pour the champagne. Sure, Mother.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> the time has come...<br> for the countdown into the new year.<br> Must be almost time. All together now!<br> Five, four, three,<br> two, one.<br> Happy New Year!<br> Happy New Year, darling. <br> Happy New Year to you.<br> - Where do you wanna go?<br> - Mm. The table.<br> All right. Mary. Did you see Kenny?<br> Martin! Martin!<br> Martin!<br> Oh! Caroline.<br> You know youre not<br> supposed to go in there!<br> Now what did I tell you<br> about going in that pool?<br> You know you're not<br> supposed to go in there!<br> Donna!<br> - Hello there.<br> - Well, hello.<br> Nice swim, darling? Ahh.<br> Isn't the sun just marvellous? Mm-hmm.<br> Donna. Time to get out. What? But why?<br> Because I said so.<br> - Here comes Kenny.<br> - I was looking for you on the other side.<br> I tell you, we're gonna<br> have to start meeting points.<br> That does it. I've had quite enough<br> fashion advice for the afternoon.<br> I do believe it's time<br> for my Miss Mitchell.<br> Oh, heavens. What?<br> I think I left it upstairs. So<br> silly. You want me to go get it?<br> No. You just sat down.<br> Oh, no. I don't mind.<br> You sure? Yeah. I have<br> to get a paper anyway.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> I think it's right<br> there on the nightstand.<br> Hey, Hutch. Look. What?<br> Hey, fellas!<br> Look who's coming. It's daddy's girl.<br> Hey there, daddy's girl. Where<br> do you think you're going?<br> Home. Home to see your daddy?<br> Yeah. And his white girlfriend.<br> Hey! Where you going?<br> We just wanna play.<br> Uh-oh. Wrong turn, daddy's girl.<br> Hey, daddy's girl. Over here.<br> Yeah. She made a wrong turn<br> all right. Just like her daddy.<br> They're here! I see<br> their car! They're here!<br> Welcome home, Mr. and Mrs.<br> Whitaker. Oh, my goodness.<br> What a lovely greeting.<br> Hiya, Pop. Hey, Mother.<br> Hey. So, Mother, was it dreamy?<br> Oh-ho. Listen to you. "Dreamy."<br> Did you have a nice time, Mr.<br> Whitaker? Yes. It was very relaxing.<br> Say, Pop-- David, help Sybil<br> with the luggage please.<br> Pop, you'll never guess what<br> happened at school this week.<br> Try and guess. David. Uh, I give up.<br> I'm helping, Mother. Billy<br> Hutchinson and these two other boys...<br> all got expelled from school.<br> I think you mean "suspended."<br> No. Expelled. I swear.<br> For throwing a rock at a<br> girl's head. That's terrible.<br> - A little girl at school?<br> - No. She was a Negro.<br> What? Who told you such<br> a thing? Tommy Hawkins.<br> He saw it, so he had<br> to tell the principal.<br> Sybil, is this true? Yes,<br> ma'am. I'm afraid it is.<br> What on Earth has gotten into this town?<br> It was just a couple of foolish kids.<br> Yeah. Hutch said that they were<br> just trying to teach her a lesson.<br> Well, I think it's dreadful, and you're not to<br> play with that Hutch boy again, understand me?<br> -Yes, ma'am.<br> - David, while youre up,<br> how about flippin'on<br> the set for your old man?<br> Sure, Pop.<br> - Mother, how do you spell "skirt"?<br> - Uh, just a minute, dear.<br> Mother's making a call.<br> Oh. Yes. Hello. Um, I was wondering<br> if you could help me possibly.<br> I just received your brochure,<br> which I found extremely informative,<br> and I was curious about what was<br> entailed, precisely, in your--<br> in your volunteer program in terms<br> of particular skills and so on.<br> You see,<br> I-- Oh.<br> Oh, yes. I can hold.<br> Father's home.<br> Frank. What happened to the match?<br> Oh, my, um, shoulder.<br> It started acting up.<br> I-- I just couldn't<br> sit there any longer.<br> You didn't say anything. Father,<br> I did the splits today. Wanna see?<br> Janice, your father just<br> walked in the door...<br> and you have schoolwork to finish.<br> Yes, Mother.<br> You know, Frank, you<br> never had that physical.<br> And I think you're due for<br> one. Can I call Dr. Ellis?<br> You know, it's been three years.<br> Oh. Did I tell you that the paediatrician<br> thinks that Janice is going to need braces?<br> Father, do I have to? Apparently,<br> our little girl has an overbite.<br> Pop, you'll never guess what<br> I'm doing. Where is your coat?<br> It's in the garage. I'm waxing<br> Pop's car. And what's it doing there?<br> It's gonna look swell, Pop.<br> How many times do I have to tell you<br> children you are not permitted outdoors...<br> in this kind of weather unless<br> you are properly dressed?<br> Yes, ma'am. Because I give up.<br> If you wanna go and catch your<br> death of cold, then so be it.<br> You try talking some sense into them,<br> Frank, because whatever I say doesn't--<br> Frank?<br> What's the matter?<br> God.<br> David, Janice, go<br> upstairs to your rooms.<br> Now.<br> Now!<br> Frank.<br> What is it?<br> Cathy,<br> something's happened.<br> What?<br> I've fallen in love with someone...<br> who wants to be with me.<br> Oh, Cathy,<br> I-I-I<br> just-- I--<br> I never knew<br> what that felt--<br> But I know that<br> sounds so cruel, but--<br> Oh, God. Cathy, I tried.<br> I tried so hard to make it go away.<br> It-- It-- I thought<br> that I could do it...<br> for you and for the kids.<br> But... I can't.<br> I just--<br> I can't.<br> I can't.<br> I, um, assume then, you'll be...<br> wanting a divorce.<br> Cathy.<br> Eleanor.<br> Eleanor, it's me, Cathy.<br> Oh, Cathy.<br> So you see, El,<br> why I couldn't tell you<br> anything-- anything at all.<br> Oh, you dear sweet kid.<br> In a million years, I couldn't<br> have imagined. Not Frank.<br> I think that's what's<br> been hardest of all.<br> The endless secrecy.<br> Our entire lives just shut in the dark.<br> Are there savings? None to speak of.<br> Certainly not with<br> Frank's job on the line.<br> Well, honey, if theres anything<br> you need, anything at all--<br> Oh, El. I mean it.<br> We're here, all right?<br> Thank you, El,<br> for always having been.<br> You know, it's funny. What's that?<br> This whole time, the only person I was<br> able to talk to about any of this...<br> was Raymond Deagan.<br> - What?<br> - It's true.<br> Not in the way that Mona<br> intended. Nothing like that.<br> But we would just talk.<br> And somehow, it<br> made me feel--<br> I don't know.<br> Alive somewhere.<br> Eleanor, I know it's ridiculous and mad,<br> but I-- I<br> think of him.<br> I do.<br> What he's doing. What he's thinking.<br> I--<br> I do.<br> El? What can I say?<br> You're so full of<br> surprises, I'm speechless.<br> What do you mean? I'm sure I<br> must've looked entirely the fool...<br> crusading away against Mona Lauder<br> and all her so-called inventions.<br> Eleanor, how could you say such a thing?<br> I didn't say a word.<br> Who am I to tell anyone<br> how to lead their lives?<br> Eleanor, nothing happened<br> between us. I told you that.<br> Cathy, it's none of my business,<br> but you certainly make it<br> sound as if something had.<br> Mrs. Whitaker? Oh. Sybil.<br> I'm sorry to disturb<br> you, ma'am. I-I just--<br> Yes, Sybil?<br> There's something I've been wanting<br> to tell you, ma'am, for some time.<br> Something I believe you surely Anna<br> know, even if it isn't exactly my place.<br> Well, what is it? It's about<br> the little colored girl, ma'am.<br> The one that got hit. Yes.<br> What about her?<br> I'm sorry, ma'am. It was Mr.<br> Deagan's little girl, Sarah.<br> What? Oh, Sybil. No.<br> The neighbours tell me she's doing just<br> fine. Oh, that poor sweet little girl.<br> That-- How in God's name could you not<br> have told me, Sybil? This was weeks ago!<br> Mrs. Whitaker, please<br> don't be cross with me.<br> I didn't wanna make things any worse.<br> Sybil, do you know<br> where Mr. Deagan lives?<br> I believe he's been at his father's<br> old place on 12th and Governor.<br> Twelfth and Governor. Thank you.<br> Are you going there now?<br> Please keep an eye on the<br> children. I shouldn't be too long.<br> Mrs. Whitaker. What?<br> Would you like me to go with you, ma'am?<br> No. No, I'll be fine. Thankyou, Sybil.<br> Who on Earth?<br> Yes. Raymond, I-- I just<br> heard. Just this instant.<br> I heard and I jumped into my car.<br> How are you? How is Sarah?<br> We're fine. Thank you.<br> Would you meet me around the side?<br> Sarah, everything's all right. Daddy's<br> just gonna be out for a minute, okay?<br> Okay.<br> Raymond. What she must've been through.<br> What's being done to the boys? Nothing.<br> I won't put her through that again.<br> Not now. Not with rocks coming<br> through the windows every night.<br> Raymond, that's hateful. Oh,<br> it's not whites throwin' them.<br> It's coloreds. No.<br> Yeah.<br> Seems to be the one place where whites<br> and coloreds are in full harmony.<br> Anyway, we'll be outta here<br> soon enough once and for all.<br> You're moving?<br> Yeah. Where to?<br> I have a brother in Baltimore,<br> says he can find me work there.<br> So we're packing up the house.<br> Two weeks, Friday, we'll be on<br> the 4:30 train heading south.<br> What about your-- your<br> business, your shop?<br> Oh, the business is through.<br> Nobody's gonna hire me.<br> So I'm gonna sell the<br> shop to a cousin of mine.<br> Yeah. Things are...<br> pretty well finished for me here.<br> I've never lived anywhere<br> other than Hartford.<br> Perhaps...<br> sometime in the future...<br> after youre<br> settled, I could--<br> Perhaps I could come for a visit,<br> see Baltimore.<br> You<br> see, I--<br> Well, it seems as if<br> I'm to be single again.<br> Oh, Mrs. Whitaker.<br> Please call me Cathy.<br> Cathy.<br> No one would know us there.<br> I'm just not sure that<br> would be a wise idea.<br> After,<br> well,<br> everything<br> that's--<br> What matters now,<br> what has to matter the most,<br> is what's right for Sarah.<br> I've learned my lesson<br> about mixing in other worlds.<br> I've seen the sparks fly.<br> All kinds.<br> Have a proud life.<br> A splendid life.<br> Will you do that?<br> Good-bye, Cathy.<br> Hello. Cathy, did I wake you?<br> I-I'm sorry to call this<br> late. I hope I didn't, uh--<br> Uh, no. I was awake.<br> I, uh, didn't want<br> to upset the children.<br> No. No, of course not.<br> How are they, by the way?<br> Fine. Just fine. They still<br> ask when you'll be coming home.<br> I know.<br> That's, uh, partly<br> why I'm calling really.<br> I got a call from Dick yesterday...<br> and he said that everything was set,<br> um, papers drawn up.<br> And he wanted to know how Thursday<br> was for you. 3:00 or sometime?<br> I-- I told him I thought<br> you had car pool Thursdays,<br> but I wasn't absolutely<br> certain, so I said I would check.<br> You never could remember<br> my car pool days.<br> And they've always been the same.<br> Wednesdays and Fridays,<br> long as I can remember.<br> Oh, Wednesdays and<br> Fridays. Right. Uh--<br> Same old<br> absentminded--<br> What time... did you say on Thursday?<br> What? The appointment. What time?<br> Three. Uh, three o'clock.<br> All right.<br> Okay. Uh, well... great.<br> That-- That was<br> it, uh, really.<br> I... know it's late.<br> It is.<br> So I'll see you on--<br> on Thursday then.<br> See you Thursday.<br> Good-bye, Cathy.<br> Good-bye, Frank.<br> Sixty-seven dollars<br> and thirty-two cents.<br> Now, what day is today?<br> Oh, Sybil. You don't need to do that.<br> It's Friday.<br> I know it's Friday, but<br> there's so much to be done now,<br> I can hardly expect you<br> to be polishing tables.<br> No reason not to keep<br> things up. No reason at all.<br> I know. Don't forget the grocery list.<br> Thank you.<br> I don't know how on<br> Earth I'd ever manage--<br> I shouldn't be long, Sybil.<br> All right, Mrs. Whitaker.<br> Why are we turning in here?<br> I'll be right back. Where are you going?<br> Now stay put, both of you.<br> All aboard! Southbound train<br> to New York and Washington...<br> now departing!<br> All aboard!<br> All right. Thanks. I 'l I be seeing you.<br> All aboard!<br> Southbound train to New<br> York and Washington...<br> now departing.<br> All aboard!<br> Ready to go?<br> That's my girl.<br> Wesley! Come on! We'll miss the train.<br> Don't forget to call<br> your mother tomorrow.<br> All aboard! Southbound<br> train to New York City--<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Here you go. Thanks.<br> All aboard!<br> The End @<br>
