                        Fargo, North Dakota<br> I'm Jerry Lundegaard.<br> - You're Jerry Lundegaard?<br> - Yah.<br> - Shep Proudfoot said...<br> - He said you'd come at 7.30. What gives????????????<br> Shep said 8.30.<br> We've been here an hour.<br> He's peed three times already.<br> Aw. I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8.30.<br> It was a mix-up, I guess.<br> - You got the car?<br> - Yah, you bet. Its out in the lot there.<br> - Brand-new, burnt-umber Ciera.<br> - Yeah, OK. Well, sit down, then.<br> I'm Carl Showalter.<br> This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.<br> Yah. How ya doin'?<br> - So, we all set on this thing, then?<br> - Sure, Jerry. Why wouldn't we be?<br> Yeah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched<br> for you. I've got every confidence in you.<br> I guess thats it, then. Here are the keys.<br> No, thats not it, Jerry.<br> - Huh?<br> - The new vehicle, plus $40,000.<br> Yah, but the deal was the car first, then<br> the $40,000, like as if it was the ransom.<br> - I thought Shep told you.<br> - Shep didn't tell us much.<br> - Well, OK. Its...<br> - Except that you'd be here at 7.30.<br> - Yah, that was a mix-up.<br> - Yeah. You already said that.<br> Yah. But its not<br> a whole pay-in-advance deal.<br> See, I give you a brand-new vehicle<br> in advance, and then...<br> - I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.<br> - OK.<br> I'm not gonna sit here and debate.<br> I will say this, though. What Shep told us<br> didn't make a lot of sense.<br> Oh, no, its real sound. Its all worked out.<br> - You want your own wife kidnapped?<br> - Yah.<br> You...<br> My point is, you pay the ransom,<br> what, 80,000 bucks?<br> I mean, you give us half the ransom -<br> Its like robbin' Peter to pay Paul.<br> Makes no sense.<br> OK. See, its not me paying the ransom.<br> The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.<br> Her dad, he's real well-off.<br> - Now, I'm in trouble.<br> - What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?<br> Well, thats... I'm not gonna get into...<br> See, I just need the money.<br> - Now, her dad, he's real well-off.<br> - So why not just ask him for the money?<br> - Or your fucking wife.<br> - Or your fucking wife, Jerry.<br> Well...<br> Its all part of this...<br> They don't know I need it, see.<br> OK, so there's that.<br> And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.<br> So there's that on top, then.<br> - These are personal matters.<br> - Personal matters?<br> Yah. Personal matters that needn't...<br> OK, Jerry. You're tasking us<br> to peftorm this mission, but you won't...<br> You won't...<br> Oh, fuck it. Lets take a look at that Ciera.<br> Minneapolis, Minnesota<br> - Hon!<br> - Hi, hon. Welcome back.<br> - How was Fargo?<br> - Yah. Real good.<br> Dad's here.<br> - How ya doin', Wade?<br> - Yah. Pretty good.<br> - What you watchin' there?<br> - Gophers.<br> Who they playin'?<br> - Is he stayin' for supper, then?<br> - Yah, I think so. Dad?<br> - What?<br> - You stayin' for supper?<br> Yeah.<br> - May I be excused?<br> - What?<br> - You done there?<br> - Uh-huh. I'm going out.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Just McDonald's.<br> - Back at 9.30.<br> - OK.<br> He just ate. He didn't finish. He's going<br> to McDonald's instead of finishing here.<br> - He sees his friends there. Its OK.<br> - Its OK, McDonald's?<br> What do you think they do there?<br> They don't drink milkshakes!<br> Its OK, Dad.<br> Wade, have you had a chance to think<br> about that deal I was talkin' about?<br> - Those 40 acres there on Wayzata?<br> - You told me about it.<br> Yah. You said you'd think about it.<br> I understand its a lot of money.<br> Its a heck of a lot.<br> What did you want to put there?<br> - A lot. Its a limited...<br> - I know its a lot.<br> - I mean a parking lot.<br> - Yeah, well, $750,000 is a lot.<br> - Yeah, well, its a chunk, but...<br> - I had two lots. Lost a lot of money.<br> - Yah, but the difference...<br> - Why not show it to Stan Grossman?<br> Stan'll say no dice.<br> Thats why you pay him.<br> I'm askin' you here, Wade.<br> This could work out real good<br> for me and Jean and Scotty.<br> Jean and Scotty never have to worry.<br> Where is Pancake's House?<br> - What?<br> - We stop at Pancake's House.<br> You nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast.<br> I gotta go to a place where<br> I can get a shot and a beer and steak.<br> Not more fucking pancakes. Come on.<br> Oh, come on, man.<br> OK, here's an idea.<br> We can stop outside of Brainerd.<br> I know a place there we can get laid.<br> - I'm fuckin' hungry now.<br> - Yeah, yeah. Jesus.<br> I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes<br> and then we'll get laid. All right?<br> We sat right here in this room<br> and went over this.<br> - Yah, but that TruCoat...<br> - I said I didn't want any TruCoat.<br> Yah, but I'm saying, that TruCoat, you<br> don't get it, you get oxidation problems...<br> You're sitting there talking in circles<br> like we didn't go over this already.<br> - Yeah, but this TruCoat...<br> - We had a deal for $19,500.<br> Darned if you didn't tell me you'd get me<br> this car without the sealant for $19,500.<br> - All right, I'm not saying I didn't.<br> - You called me and said you had it.<br> "Ready to make delivery" you says.<br> And here you are and you're<br> wasting my time and my wife's time.<br> And I'm paying $19,500<br> for this vehicle here.<br> All right.<br> I'll talk to my boss.<br> See, they install that TruCoat<br> at the factory. There's nothing we can do.<br> But I'll talk to my boss.<br> These guys here. These guys.<br> Its always the same. Its always more.<br> - You going to the Gophers on Sunday?<br> - Oh, you betcha.<br> You wouldn't have an extra ticket?<br> You kiddin'?<br> Well.<br> He's never done this before, but seein' as<br> its special circumstances an' all,<br> he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.<br> One hundred?<br> You lied to me, Mr Lundegaard.<br> You're a bald-faced liar.<br> Bucky, please.<br> A fucking liar.<br> Bucky, please.<br> Where's my goddamn chequebook?<br> Lets get this over with.<br> Where is it?<br> From Hollywood,<br> The Tonight Show, star...<br> I am talking about your potential.<br> You're not a C student.<br> Yeah.<br> Yet you're gettin' C grades.<br> Its that disparity there<br> that concerns your dad and me.<br> - You know what a disparity is?<br> - Yeah!<br> OK. Well, thats why we<br> don't want you goin' out for hockey.<br> Oh, man! Come on. Whats the big deal?<br> It's just an hour....<br> Hold on.<br> - Whats the big deal?<br> - Hello.<br> - Yeah, hi, hon.<br> - Oh, hi, Dad.<br> - Is Jerry around?<br> - Yah. Hon?

How ya doin' there?<br> Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.<br> He says its pretty sweet.<br> - No kiddin'?<br> - Might be interested.<br> No kiddin'? I'd need the cash pretty quick<br> there, in order to close the deal.<br> Come by at 2.30. We'll talk about it. If your<br> numbers are right, Stan says its sweet.<br> - Stan, you know, Grossman.<br> - Yah.<br> - 2.30.<br> - Yah. OK.<br> Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?<br> Say, you know those two fellas you<br> put me in touch with up there in Fargo?<br> - Put you in touch with Grimsrud.<br> - Well, he had a buddy there. He...<br> - I don't vouch for him.<br> - Thats OK.<br> - I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?<br> - Carl something.<br> Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.<br> He's a buddy of the guy you vouch for,<br> so I'm not worrying.<br> I gotta get in touch with him.<br> This deal I needed 'em for, I may not need<br> it any more. Something's happenin', see.<br> - Call him up.<br> - I did, and I haven't been able to get him.<br> So I thought maybe you'd know<br> an alternate number.<br> - Nope.<br> - OK.<br> Well, real good, then.<br> Can you crack<br> a fuckin' window open, man?<br> You know, its proven second-hand smoke<br> is a carcino... You know, a cancer agent.<br> Look at that - Twin Cities.<br> Thats the IDS building, the big glass one.<br> The tallest skyscraper in the Midwest,<br> after the Sears in Chicago,<br> or John Hancock Building, whatever.<br> Have you ever been to Minneapolis?<br> Nope.<br> Would it kill you to say something?<br> - I did.<br> - "No"?<br> Thats the first thing you've said<br> in the last four hours.<br> Thats a fountain<br> of conversation, man. Thats a geyser.<br> I mean, whoa, daddy. Stand back, man.<br> Shit.<br> I'm sittin' here drivin' - I'm doin' all the<br> drivin', whole fuckin' way from Brainerd -<br> just tryin' to chat, you know, keep our<br> spirits up, fight the boredom of the road,<br> and you can't say one fuckin' thing<br> just in the way of conversation?<br> Oh, fuck it. I don't have to talk either, man.<br> See how you like it.<br> Just total fuckin' silence.<br> Two can play at that game, smart guy.<br> We'll just see how you like it.<br> Total silence.<br> Mr Lundegaard, this is Reilly Diefenbach<br> from GMAC. How are you this morning?<br> - Real good. How you doin'?<br> - Good. You're hard to get on the phone.<br> Yah, its pretty darn busy here,<br> but thats the way we like it.<br> Thats for sure. Now, I just need, on these<br> last financing documents you sent us,<br> I can't read the serial numbers.<br> Yah, but its OK. The loans are in place.<br> I already got the... What?<br> - $320,000. You got the money last month.<br> - Yah. So we're all set, then.<br> Yes, but the vehicles you're borrowing on,<br> I can't read the serial numbers. If you...<br> - But the deal's done. I got the money.<br> - Yes. We have an audit here.<br> I just have to know that these vehicles<br> you're financing with this money exist.<br> - Yah, well, they exist all right.<br> - Well, I'm sure they do.<br> But I can't read the serial numbers,<br> so if you could read me...<br> Yah, but, see... I don't have 'em in front<br> of me. Why don't I fax you over a copy?<br> Fax is no good. Thats what I have,<br> and I can't read the darn thing...<br> Yah, OK. I'll have my girl<br> send you a copy, then.<br> OK. Because if I can't correlate this note<br> with the vehicles, I call back that money.<br> - Yah. How much money was that?<br> - $320,000.<br> I gotta correlate that money<br> with the cars its being lent on.<br> - OK. No problem. I'll fax that over...<br> - No, no. Fax is...<br> - I mean send it. I'll shoot it over to you.<br> - OK, fine.<br> OK. Real good, then.<br> - We're with Katie Carlson.<br> - Hi.<br> Now, we just want to remind<br> all of our viewers at home<br> that this March, for the second year in<br> a row, Katie and I, with Twin City Travel,<br> will be leading<br> a two-week trip down the Nile.<br> Its a terrific time. I know you've heard<br> about it. We want all of you to come with.<br> And thats the truth.<br> OK, for those who've just joined us,<br> Katie is gonna show us<br> how to make Holidazzle eggs at home.<br> - Now, Katie, I gotta admit.<br> - What?<br> I was a little bit surprised when I first<br> picked this up. This is an empty egg.<br> - Thats right, Dale.<br> - There was an egg in here, right?<br> - Yeah.<br> - OK, well, how do you...<br> You don't have an empty chicken<br> somewhere that lays empty eggs?<br> No, no. I guarantee this was<br> an honest-to-goodness Grade A...<br> - Unguent.<br> - What?<br> I need unguent.<br> - Am I doin' it?<br> - Push it.<br> Shit.<br> - How're you, Stan? How ya doin', Wade?<br> - Good to see you again, Jerry.<br> If the numbers are right,<br> this looks pretty sweet.<br> - Oh, those numbers are right, all right.<br> - This is doable.<br> - Congratulations, Jer.<br> - Thanks, Stan. Its a pretty...<br> What kind of finder's fee<br> were you looking for?<br> The financials are pretty thorough, so<br> the only thing we don't know is your fee.<br> My fee? Wade, what the heck<br> are you talkin' about?<br> - Stan and I are OK.<br> - Yah.<br> - We're good to load in.<br> - Yah.<br> But we never talked about your fee<br> for bringing it to us.<br> No, Wade, I was bringing you this deal<br> for you to loan me the money to put in.<br> Its my deal here, see.<br> We thought you were<br> bringing us an investment.<br> - Yah. Right.<br> - You're sayin'... What are you sayin'?<br> You're saying we put in all the money<br> and you collect when it pays off.<br> No, no, see, but I'd pay you back<br> the principal, and interest.<br> - Heck, I'd go one over prime.<br> - We're not a bank, Jerry.<br> If I wanted bank interest on $750,000, I'd<br> go to Midwest Federal, talk to Bill Diehl.<br> - He's at Norstar.<br> - He's at...<br> No, no. But, see,<br> I don't need a finder's fee.<br> I need...<br> Finder's fee's, what, 10%? Heck, thats not<br> gonna do it for me. I need the principal.<br> - We're not gonna give you $750,000.<br> - What the heck were you thinking?<br> If I'm only getting bank interest,<br> I want complete security. Heck, FDIC.<br> - I don't see nothing like that here.<br> - Yeah, but I...<br> OK. I'd guarantee you your money back.<br> I'm not talking about<br> your damn word, Jerry.<br> - Jeez, what the heck are you...<br> - We're not a bank, Jerry.<br> Well, look, I don't wanna cut you out<br> of the loop, but this here's a good deal.<br> I assume if you're not interested,<br> you won't mind if we move on it.<br> Independently.<br> Dammit! Dammit!<br> Hon?<br> Got the groceries.<br> Yah, Wade, its Jerry.<br> I...<br> Wade, its Jerry.<br> I don't know what to do. Its Jean.<br> I don't know what to do. Its my wife.<br> I don't know what to do. Its Jean.<br> Yeah, Wade, its Jerry. I...<br> Wade, its Jerry. I... We gotta talk.<br> Its somethin'... Aw, jeez, its terrible.<br> Yes?<br> Yeah.
