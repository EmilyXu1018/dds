                        Hey, kid.<br> You wanna spar a little?<br> - You a pro?<br> - I used to be.<br> I'm all out of shape now.<br> Come on. I won't hit you hard.<br> Maybe we can just fool around.<br> Maybe I can teach you a few things.<br> Here, you better put this on.<br> You look pretty good.<br> Ready?<br> - You all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> Good.<br> Time.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yeah. I pulled a muscle.<br> You okay?<br> I should have warmed up better.<br> Anyway, I haven't fought<br> in a year and a half.<br> What's your name?<br> - Ernie Munger.<br> - How many bouts you had?<br> - None.<br> - You're kidding me.<br> - You've never been in the ring before?<br> - No.<br> I just came down here<br> to the Y to fool around a little.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Eighteen.<br> - You've never been in the ring?<br> - No.<br> Well, I think you got it, kid.<br> I ought to know what I'm talking about.<br> I fought Efram Soto.<br> You know, there was a time<br> when nobody could hit me.<br> I mean, they tried, you know,<br> but I wouldn't be there.<br> You ought to start fighting.<br> Oh, no.<br> I just come down here to fool around.<br> Well, listen, don't waste your good years.<br> You know,<br> you ought to go over to the Lido Gym<br> and see my manager, Ruben Luna.<br> Tell him I sent you. My name's Billy Tully.<br> - I saw you fight once.<br> - Yeah? Did I win?<br> No.<br> Don't you ever go home?<br> I just got here.<br> What's keeping him?<br> He can see we're sitting here.<br> Can't you get him<br> to come over and serve us?<br> Just take it easy. He'll be here.<br> Well, you spineless son of a bitch.<br> You'd take up for anybody against me,<br> wouldn't you?<br> I want a cream sherry.<br> Earl and me got something<br> very wonderful together.<br> I love that man more than<br> any man's got a right to be loved.<br> If he left me, I just couldn't make it.<br> I couldn't live without him.<br> Do you think he'd even raise his voice<br> and get me a drink?<br> No. He'll just sit there and let him ignore us.<br> - Here he comes.<br> - Yeah, no thanks to you.<br> Two sherries.<br> I pulled a muscle.<br> Yeah. I make up my mind<br> to go back into training,<br> I hardly get the gloves on, I pull a muscle.<br> Earl?<br> - This guy's a fighter.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Oh, Christ. Why did I even mention it?<br> What do you know about it, anyway?<br> - Not much.<br> - That's what I mean. Sorry to bother you.<br> Why did I open my mouth? I apologise.<br> Well, what do you want? I said I was sorry.<br> - What more can I say?<br> - I hear you, baby.<br> Well, Jesus, you sure don't act like it.<br> I was sparring with this young kid.<br> He's a good young prospect.<br> He could make a lot of money some day<br> if he was handled right.<br> A natural athlete.<br> What's his name?<br> You wouldn't know<br> who he was if he did tell you.<br> - Just asking.<br> - He's got to know everything.<br> Oh, now he's mad.<br> Now he's not going to talk.<br> He butts in, then he shuts up.<br> I wanna hear this.<br> - You go ahead.<br> - That's it. Nothing more to hear.<br> That is all.<br> The kid is a natural,<br> and they come along about one in a million.<br> He's so goddamn sour.<br> I don't see why I can't have a little fun.<br> I believe that everybody<br> has a right to live his own life.<br> So screw everybody.<br> I want to say something.<br> I'm gonna make a toast here<br> to this gentleman.<br> I'll make it short. Just a few words.<br> Here's to your health.<br> God bless you and keep you<br> in all your battles.<br> - Oma.<br> - What is it?<br> Nothing.<br> Oh, for Christ's sakes,<br> what do you want, then?<br> Can't I even talk to anybody?<br> - I'm not stopping you.<br> - No, you're not stopping me.<br> You just sit there with your face shut<br> until the minute I start having a good time.<br> I'm sick of your bellyaching.<br> Is it my fault that you can't fit in?<br> Why can't you mind your own business?<br> And that goes for the rest of you.<br> Go to hell with you.<br> Wanna fight, kid?<br> - How much you weigh?<br> - 175.<br> Yeah. You have a very good reach.<br> You looking for a manager?<br> Yeah. I'm looking for Ruben Luna.<br> Ruben Luna!<br> Thanks.<br> I'm Luna. You wanna see me?<br> Yeah. I thought I'd work out a little bit,<br> see what you think.<br> - Billy Tully told me to come by.<br> - You know Billy?<br> - You got your stuff in there?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on, get into your trunks.<br> So what's Billy doing these days?<br> Oh, he didn't say.<br> I only met him once at the Y.<br> - We sparred a little.<br> - How'd you do with him? All right?<br> Well, you must have done all right.<br> Tully getting in shape?<br> What's he doing at the Y?<br> Why isn't he here at the Lido?<br> I think he's afraid<br> to show his face around here.<br> He was in about a year ago,<br> said he wanted to start fighting again.<br> Trained for three days, borrowed 20 bucks,<br> I haven't seen him since.<br> Look what Felix Castillo done to me.<br> You know how much money<br> I gave that guy?<br> I used to give him $2,<br> $3 nearly every damn day.<br> It was movies, movies.<br> Every damn day, movies.<br> Tully didn't know how to throw a punch<br> when he first came to me.<br> I put him on his way to the top.<br> He was the best fighter I ever handled.<br> He was tough, and he had heart.<br> You can't watch a guy 24 hours a day.<br> He married some broad,<br> and she undid all the good I did for him.<br> And she destroyed his peace of mind.<br> He started losing fights,<br> so she ran off on him.<br> Come on, kid. All set?<br> - Let's get at it. Come on.<br> - Time.<br> I'm not rushing you.<br> I don't want you to think that.<br> I just want to get a good look at you. Wes?<br> Sorry.<br> Time. Come on.<br> You're okay.<br> Easy. That's okay.<br> All right. Now...<br> Step in with that jab, right?<br> His head goes back. Hit him again.<br> Okay, then hit him with the right...<br> Okay. All right. That's it.<br> Fade in, fade in, make your openings.<br> You make your openings and then...<br> - You understand what I mean?<br> - Yeah.<br> Okay. There you go.<br> There's a white kid come in today<br> that might shape up into something.<br> That's good.<br> He's got a great reach,<br> and a good pair of legs.<br> And he's white, you know.<br> Real clean, good-looking kid.<br> Oh, I got nothing against coloureds.<br> There's just too many of them in the game.<br> Anglos don't want to pay<br> to see two coloured guys fight.<br> They want to see a white guy fight.<br> This kid could develop.<br> Oh, you ought to see the reach on him.<br> He's tall, you know.<br> If he put on some weight, he could turn into<br> a good-looking white heavyweight.<br> He could draw crowds some day<br> if he ever learnt how to fight.<br> Well, maybe he can, if he just listen to me<br> and let me put everything I know into him.<br> Victoria?<br> Sweetheart? You awake?<br> Who wants to go to work? Onion toppers.<br> - Tomatoes, 60 cents a box.<br> - Cucumbers, 20 cents a box.<br> Tomatoes. Over here!<br> Who wants to go to work? Onion toppers...<br> Who wants to go to work?<br> Tomatoes, 60 cents a box... Tomatoes!<br> Cucumbers, 20 cents a box. Cucumbers!<br> - Tomatoes!<br> - Cucumbers, 20 cents a box.<br> Who wants to go to work? Onion toppers...<br> Who wants to go to work? Onion toppers...<br> Who wants to go to work? Onion toppers...<br> Twenty cents a sack.<br> Melons!<br> Come on, let's go pick those melons.<br> Come on, boys, who wants to go to work?<br> Okay!<br> How much you pay a sack?<br> If a man wants to work,<br> he can make $15 or $20 a day.<br> - How much you paying a sack?<br> - Twenty cents.<br> Come on here! Onion toppers, over here.<br> Young fella like you<br> ought to have a proper job.<br> - I had a job. I just got fired.<br> - What was it? Maybe I could get it.<br> Fry cook.<br> I can't cook.<br> I can't, either.<br> Bust my ass for eight bucks yesterday<br> and, good God,<br> here I am in this bus again.<br> You made eight bucks?<br> Heck, you made more than I did.<br> I worked like hell all day yesterday.<br> After they made the deductions,<br> I only had five bucks left.<br> Sure tough to make a buck these days.<br> No, keep that head moving.<br> All the time, moving, moving.<br> I bought Ernie his amateur licence<br> this morning.<br> - Good. You'll be out five bucks.<br> - No, he won't quit. Guess what happened?<br> The doctor wanted to test his blood.<br> Could hardly get the needle in.<br> - Dull needle, huh?<br> - No, no. He tried two needles.<br> - Who's this? Ernie?<br> - Yes.<br> The doctor could hardly get the needle in.<br> What's the matter, dull needle?<br> - No, the kid's got skin like leather.<br> - That's odd, Ruben. That's very odd.<br> Never would have thought that,<br> looking at him.<br> Rudy Chavez had thick skin,<br> but he was tough.<br> Oh, you guys know that.<br> They don't make them like him any more.<br> You haven't heard the half of it.<br> He finally gets the needle in, and he gets<br> the blood out and it's almost black.<br> You know, I had Chavez<br> in against Chu Chu Montoya,<br> and the first round,<br> my boy gets butted over the eye<br> and the blood starts coming down.<br> So I said, "Well, there goes the fight."<br> It wasn't his blood at all,<br> it was Montoya's blood.<br> Do you remember that guy Estrada?<br> I've seen him<br> open a Coke bottle with his teeth.<br> What the hell you saying?<br> Didn't they break?<br> Will you listen, please?<br> You haven't heard the half of it.<br> He finally gets the blood out,<br> see, and it's black.<br> He stares at it for a minute,<br> and he turns the tube upside down,<br> and the blood don't run down.<br> It hangs up there. It's like turned to gelatine.<br> That Chavez had the clearest piss<br> of any fighter I ever saw.<br> He would take a specimen,<br> and the piss in that bottle<br> would be just as clean and as pure<br> as fresh drinking water.<br> Take the wheel.<br> No, easy. Slow and easy. That's it.<br> Okay. Go easy. Go easy.<br> - Don't spin the wheels. Hold it.<br> - Well, what are you saying?<br> I can't hear you. What?<br> Will you hold it, Faye?<br> I'm going to look for some boards,<br> something to put under the wheel.<br> Hold it!<br> Move over.<br> - Don't touch me, I'm all muddy.<br> - I don't care if you're muddy or not.<br> - Put your arm around me.<br> - Not while I'm driving in the rain.<br> - I'm glad.<br> - About what?<br> You know, not being a virgin any more.<br> What?<br> Not that I feel any different.<br> It's just that I thought I would see<br> the world through new eyes, but I don't.<br> - You've never done it before?<br> - Certainly not.<br> You've done it lots of times, I suppose.<br> Well, I'm going on 19, after all.<br> - How was I compared to the other girls?<br> - All right.<br> I mean, wonderful. You were wonderful.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah, wonderful.<br> I'll get better with practise.<br> Anybody would have thought<br> you had all the practise in the world.<br> I hope you're not implying anything.<br> No, I meant you were wonderful.<br> - Will you call me tomorrow?<br> - What for?<br> Oh, no reason.<br> Just want to hear the sound of your voice.<br> Okay.<br> Let's go, guys.<br> Let's go, Babe!<br> Monterey, here we come.<br> We got the winners tonight, Babe.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Yeah, I think we got the winners.<br> Four sure winners.<br> You know what I'd like to do, someday?<br> - What?<br> - I'd like to take these guys to England.<br> They really appreciate class over there.<br> You know, when I turn these boys pro,<br> I'd really like to make that trip.<br> Ernie, listen.<br> This guy can't fight. You'll knock him out.<br> How do you feel?<br> Hardly wait to get in there, huh?<br> I'll give him everything I've got.<br> Now you may have to go the full three,<br> so don't punch yourself out.<br> - Don't lose your head.<br> - Pace myself.<br> Well, you know, don't hang back,<br> it goes fast.<br> - I'll give it everything I've got.<br> - Yeah, but still, you wanna pace yourself.<br> Buford, now your guy's been around.<br> Don't let him get a good shot at you.<br> He's a boozer.<br> You know how these soldiers are.<br> He won't go the limit.<br> I don't care who he is,<br> 'cause there ain't anybody getting past me,<br> 'cause I'm gonna be the world's champ<br> by the time I'm 18.<br> - Ain't he 18 now?<br> - Shit, he's only 15.<br> Can you fight if you're only 15?<br> We need to keep quiet about that.<br> Buford's a Golden Gloves champion,<br> and he don't fit the rules.<br> Hope I didn't leave my fight in the bedroom.<br> Hey, don't tell Ruben this, but I was out<br> getting me a little last night.<br> - I hope I'm in shape.<br> - I was, too.<br> But that don't make no difference.<br> It don't matter if you dead drunk.<br> You got two hands. You can beat this dude.<br> I don't care who he is. It's all in your mind.<br> - I hope so.<br> - Hoping never done nothing.<br> It's more in the doing.<br> You gotta want to win so bad<br> you can taste it.<br> If you want to win bad enough, you win.<br> There ain't no way in hell this dude's<br> gonna beat me, 'cause he's too old,<br> I'm too fast, I'm gonna be all over him.<br> I'm gonna kick his ass so bad,<br> every time he takes a bite of food tomorrow,<br> he's gonna think of me.<br> He's gonna know he's been in a fight,<br> 'cause I'm going to hit him with everything.<br> I'm not just gonna beat that mother,<br> I'm gonna kill him.<br> You want to know<br> what makes a good fighter?<br> - What's that?<br> - It's believing in yourself. The will to win.<br> You want to kick ass, you kick ass.<br> Hope you're right.<br> You don't want to kick ass,<br> you want to get your own ass whupped.<br> Look, I want to kick ass.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> You gotta want to kick ass so bad<br> there ain't no manager,<br> trainer, pill that can do it for you.<br> I want to kick ass as bad as you do.<br> - Then go on out there and kick ass.<br> - All right!<br> First bout. Ernie Munger.<br> We gotta go now. Babe, did you get<br> the towels, did you get the towels?<br> Hey, I didn't get a chance to warm up.<br> You're okay, you're ready.<br> Just stay loose, eh?<br> - Where's the bucket?<br> - In my hand.<br> - Where's the bottle?<br> - Bottle's in the bucket.<br> - Got water in it?<br> - I wouldn't bring an empty bottle.<br> I just don't want my kid out there<br> without any water, Babe.<br> I got the damn water. Take it easy.<br> I told you I got the water.<br> Well, let's go.<br> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Welcome to tonight's star-studded<br> programme of amateur boxing.<br> Each bout will consist<br> of three two-minute rounds,<br> in accordance with<br> the California State Athletic Commission.<br> Your referee is from San Francisco,<br> Bob Mitchem.<br> This is the first bout of the night.<br> Introducing first, blue corner, his weight,<br> Irish Ernie Munger.

Look at mine.<br> Would you believe mine was ever busted?<br> Yes.<br> I don't know what kind of deal<br> we were getting tonight,<br> but I never seen anything like it.<br> Stopping that fight<br> when Ernie had that guy beat.<br> That kid should have been disqualified.<br> And Wes, he wasn't hurt either.<br> I mean, anybody can get tagged<br> in the first round.<br> And Bobby, he won every round.<br> He did. That's a fact.<br> That was robbery if I ever seen it.<br> You were hurting that boy.<br> Hey, sweetheart, sweetheart.<br> Can we have some more beer<br> and some more pop for the boys?<br> A glass of beer, please.<br> Hey!<br> Hi!<br> How you been keeping?<br> Terrible.<br> You alone?<br> Mind if I sit down?<br> It's a free country.

He picked me up<br> and he threw me on that bed.<br> Well, don't look at me like that.<br> I'm not ashamed to say it.<br> I've never been ashamed of the act of love.<br> - I believe it's a part of life.<br> - Sure. Why not?<br> I mean...<br> Of course, if people like each other.<br> I'm not talking about free love.<br> I have no use for that.<br> You know,<br> free depends what you mean "free."<br> I mean, if it's not<br> free,<br> can you call it love?<br> I'm talking about love.<br> Real love, not just sex.<br> When you're really in love,<br> you marry for life,<br> and that is the only way it can be.<br> I don't consider<br> my second marriage sanctified.<br> - I should've stayed true to Frank.<br> - Frank? Who's Frank?<br> Frank. That was my first husband.<br> He's full-blooded Cherokee.<br> - You married an Indian?<br> - What's wrong with that?<br> - You think you're any better?<br> - I'm not knocking it.<br> You just watch what you say.<br> I won't stand for any insults against Frank.<br> I still wear his wedding ring.<br> Where is he?<br> I'm a widow.<br> That's too bad.<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> What happened to him?<br> He was shot.<br> No kidding?<br> - Who did it?<br> - He was a police officer.<br> He was killed in the line of duty.<br> That's terrible.<br> I was married, too. She ran out on me.<br> We didn't even have time to have children.<br> I married white next time.<br> All he was good for<br> was running us off an embankment.<br> That and spending the insurance.<br> Marrying him was the biggest mistake<br> of my life.<br> He had unnatural desires.<br> He did?<br> The white race is in its decline.<br> It started downhill in 1492,<br> when Columbus discovered syphilis.<br> What did he want to do?<br> - White men are animals.<br> - Oh, gosh, we're not so bad.<br> - White man is the vermin of the earth!<br> - Hey, come on, not so loud.<br> Don't tell me what to do!<br> I don't care who hears me.<br> I know I'm making a nuisance of myself.<br> All these goddamn Mexicans sitting here.<br> - They don't know who their real friends are!<br> - Hey, calm down.<br> - What are you going on about? Take it easy.<br> - Don't tell me...<br> Will you take your hands off me?<br> Listen, you know,<br> you are liable to get backhanded<br> right off that stool if you're not careful.<br> You see if I care one bit. That's all I need.<br> You go ahead, if it'll make you feel so good.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Go on, get it out of your system.<br> - I was just kidding.<br> - Go on, if it'll make you feel good,<br> - punch me in the face.<br> - Oh, God almighty.<br> Take some teeth out while you're at it.<br> I still got a few left in there<br> that the others<br> were nice enough to leave me.<br> - Come on, I wouldn't hit you.<br> - Come on, come on...<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - ...big lift for you. What are you waiting for?<br> It's just the thing you need.<br> - Hey, listen, I'm sorry.<br> - Far be it from me to spoil anybody's fun.<br> I'm sorry. Will you listen to me?<br> God damn it, I am sorry!<br> So what? So you're sorry.<br> Well, I feel I could break my head.<br> Go ahead. I'm not going to stop you.<br> Feel like I could just bust my head...<br> - On that jukebox.<br> - Go ahead.<br> What did you do that for?<br> You told me to go ahead and do it, so I did.<br> You can count on me right down the line.<br> You wanna knock your brains out?<br> You can count on me.<br> Just don't bump your head any more.<br> Listen... Let me tell you something.<br> You can count on me right down the line.<br> I thought you wanted to hit me.<br> Oh, well, will you forget that?<br> I never hit a woman in my life.<br> Hey, let me buy you a drink.<br> Could we have two cream sherries, please?<br> Why don't you believe me?<br> Don't you think that you can count on me?<br> Just don't bump your head any more.<br> Oh, come on. Come on. Will you forget that?<br> Hey, listen, I just asked you a question.<br> Do you think I'd let you down?<br> - I don't know. Would you?<br> - Hey, I wouldn't.<br> - I wouldn't.<br> - Maybe you wouldn't.<br> How would I know?<br> You<br> can<br> count<br> on me!<br> You can count on me.<br> - No, I'm the reliable type.<br> - Do you know who your friends are?<br> Listen. Anytime you need anything,<br> you just come and see me.<br> These others, I wouldn't ask the time of day.<br> They wouldn't give it to you.<br> Do you know something?<br> You're the only son of a bitch<br> worth shit in this place.<br> I appreciate that.<br> I mean, because there's something<br> I really like about you.<br> I like you, too.<br> To us.<br> - Let's get out of this joint.<br> - Yeah.<br> Let's go somewheres else.<br> Keep the change.<br> Hey, you all right?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You gonna make it?<br> I guess I'm drunk.<br> Don't worry about anything.<br> I'll get you home.<br> - Okay.<br> - You can count on me.<br> - We going the right way?<br> - Yep.<br> What's the matter?<br> Hey.<br> I love you so much.<br> Hey, come on.<br> Hey, everything's going to be okay now.<br> - I feel it is.<br> - It is.<br> - You can count on me.<br> - Right.<br> - And I can count on you.<br> - Yep.<br> I can count on you and you can count on me<br> And we can count on each other<br> - White look all right on me?<br> - Perfect.<br> - You a professional?<br> - Amateur.<br> Won his last three fights.<br> They couldn't touch him. The kid's fast.<br> - What do you think?<br> - Yeah, it's just the right image for you.<br> When you come out in that,<br> you're gonna look like a champ.<br> Champion of the world.<br> One, two, three...<br> The winner,<br> by a KO in 23 seconds of Round 1.<br> Let's get him in his corner.<br> Come on, Ernie, come on, baby, come on.<br> Easy. Take it easy.<br> What's your name? What's your name?<br> Where are you?<br> - Did I get knocked out?<br> - What's your name?<br> - Tell me your name. Can you do that?<br> - Ernie Munger.<br> What round is it?<br> How many fingers do you see?<br> - Can you see my hand? How many fingers?<br> - Five.<br> - He's okay.<br> - You're okay, Ernie.<br> Faye?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> Don't you feel good?<br> - I'm all right.<br> - Is anything wrong?<br> - I said nothing.<br> - Well, what are you mad about, then?<br> Can't I be quiet if I feel like it without<br> everybody getting all worked up?<br> You're the only one<br> who's getting worked up.<br> Well, leave me alone, then.<br> I've a right to my moods.<br> All right, I can take a hint.<br> Don't think I don't know what's wrong.<br> You're unfulfilled, I know.<br> I'm fulfilled. I'm perfectly fulfilled.<br> - That's not what's bothering me.<br> - You didn't get real fulfillment.<br> Don't worry about that. I'm fulfilled.<br> That's not it at all.<br> - You're mad about something.<br> - I'm not mad.<br> Just a little worried, that's all.<br> About what?<br> You know what.<br> We've been pretty careful.<br> If I was careful, I never would have<br> come out here in the first place.<br> You wouldn't marry me now.<br> I just know you wouldn't.<br> Men just don't after the mystery's gone.<br> They do, too. They do it all the time.<br> What are you talking about?<br> - Well, you wouldn't.<br> - I would, too.<br> When?<br> Well, when it'd be right for both of us.<br> We don't want to rush into a mess<br> when we've got each other anyway.<br> Well, don't you want<br> to be with me every night?<br> Sure. Maybe I can get a day job.<br> Not what I meant.<br> Look, we don't want to rush into something.<br> Look, don't think I'm proposing to you.<br> That's a thing I certainly would never do.<br> I wouldn't want anybody<br> who didn't want me.<br> - I want you.<br> - I certainly wouldn't force myself on anyone.<br> It's just that I like to know<br> where I stand, that's all.<br> Supposing you got draughted, would you<br> expect me to be here when you came back?<br> Yeah.<br> Then why should we wait?<br> I could quit school and get a job.<br> I want to be with you all the time.<br> I want to cook for you.<br> I don't know how you feel.<br> I wouldn't want you to marry me<br> just because you thought you had to.<br> Oh, sure no one has to, I guess.<br> I mean, you know, we could do<br> something about it, easy enough.<br> Yeah. Sure we could, but I wouldn't want to.<br> If I was, I'd want to have it. Wouldn't you?<br> Wouldn't you feel anything?<br> Oh, sure.<br> Maybe you'd better see a doctor.<br> Honey, give me a cup of coffee.<br> How's it going, Ruben?<br> Well, I lost another one.<br> Ernie snuck off and got married.<br> I might have known it.<br> Honey, what kind of pie you got?<br> Never mind. Give me what he's got.<br> - Boy, she sure knows how to fill a skirt.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I talked to his mother on the phone.<br> He got married.<br> What can you expect?<br> All that energy they waste.<br> If they're not getting married,<br> they're getting arrested,<br> or they're joining the Navy<br> or they're killing themselves<br> on motorcycles.<br> You know why I think he did it?<br> I think that beating discouraged him.<br> Well, if you don't have confidence<br> in yourself,<br> you're never going to get anywhere.<br> I remember the first time I passed blood.<br> That was one scared kid.<br> Sure. When I got my jaw broken,<br> and I had to suck liquids through that straw,<br> I started wondering if it was all worthwhile.<br> I'll tell you what bothered me.<br> Getting my throat ruined.<br> You didn't keep your chin down.<br> How's your nose? Can you breathe?<br> - Yeah, can't you?<br> - Not on a wet day.<br> - Hi, honey.<br> - Hi.<br> How'd it go?<br> Well,<br> the canneries weren't hiring today.<br> Did you try the box factory?<br> I already been fired from the box factory.<br> You know, I guess I'm just going<br> to have to start fighting again.<br> - Honey.<br> - Yeah?<br> - I wish you wouldn't do that.<br> - Do what?<br> - Kick Earl's box.<br> - I didn't kick it. I fell over it.<br> I don't believe<br> in kicking a man when he's down.<br> Honey, it is not Earl in the box.<br> It's just his clothes.<br> Clothes make the man.<br> You know something, honey?<br> You ought to spruce yourself up a little.<br> You're a good-looking man.<br> You should put your best foot forward.<br> I know how I look. I look like a bum.<br> - I am a bum.<br> - You're not a bum.<br> If you took a little more pains<br> with your appearance,<br> I bet you could<br> even get a job you really liked.<br> The job I really like hasn't been invented.<br> You're handsome. You are.<br> All you need is a little more flair.<br> Flair?<br> Here.<br> Try this on.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Go on now, try this on.<br> - No. I don't want to try it on.<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't want to try it on. It belongs to Earl.<br> - Earl would understand.<br> Oh, come on now,<br> he's the kindest-hearted man in the world.<br> For me?<br> Honey.<br> Get over there.<br> What do you think? Have I got flair now?<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Poor bastard.<br> - Who?<br> - Earl.<br> Eating his heart out in the pokey.<br> Oh, boy.<br> I'm in worse shape than I thought I was.<br> How long before a man<br> gets used to this, anyways?<br> I been doing it for 25 years,<br> and I ain't gotten used to it yet.<br> All a man needs<br> is a woman with a good job.<br> I had that. She left.<br> I got one now that won't work at all.<br> That's the easiest kind to get.<br> I had a good one once, but she divorced me.<br> - How come?<br> - All because of wine.<br> Wine?<br> You see, my wife would go to work,<br> and I'd sit home and drink wine.<br> And there was this girl<br> that lived across the hall.<br> She was a friend of my wife<br> and my door would be open,<br> and I'd see her walk by.<br> I asked her if she wanted a drink.<br> So we started drinking together<br> and she's looking better and better,<br> until I'm over there<br> as soon as my wife leaves.<br> And coming back just before she gets home.<br> So my wife figures something's up,<br> 'cause I'm all the time<br> yawning and fall asleep<br> as soon as I get in bed.<br> So she goes across the hall<br> and sees this girl.<br> And a big bunch of roses in a jar.<br> So she asks this girl, she says,<br> "Where'd you get those roses?"<br> And that girl, she says,<br> "I don't know. They just come."<br> So my wife go down<br> to the corner, to the florist<br> and ask did I buy a big bunch of red roses.<br> So he said yes.<br> So that's how wine broke up my marriage.<br> Sounds like it was roses to me.<br> It was wine and roses.<br> So now I'm out here, chopping weeds.<br> - I'll tell you girls something. Esteban here...<br> - Can I have a match?<br> Esteban here is one hell of a fighter.<br> Could've made champ. Except for his hands.<br> Show them your hands, Esteban.<br> See, he hit too hard<br> for the size of his hands.<br> You know what happened to me, Esteban?<br> Mismanagement. Ruben.<br> Remember my fight with Soto?<br> To save a lousy couple of hundred bucks,<br> he flew me down to Panama,<br> all by myself and blew my chance.<br> And you know who Soto was then?<br> Number five. He was a good boy.<br> Good? I had that bum hanging on.<br> I was knocking him silly for six rounds.<br> So I'm back in my corner,<br> and I'm not paying attention<br> to anything they're doing to me.<br> I know I got him.<br> The bell rings, I come out for the seventh,<br> he pops me a couple of times,<br> and suddenly the referee stops the fight.<br> There's blood pouring down me.<br> Can you believe that?<br> Both of my eyes are cut.<br> Everybody's happy. I mean,<br> the audience is screaming their heads off.<br> So, in seconds, they patch me all up<br> and they put me on a plane,<br> they're all smiles.<br> So I get back to Stockton,<br> I go down to see Ruben<br> and he looks at the butterflies,<br> takes them off, takes a peek at the cuts<br> and tells me they were done with a razor.<br> - Were they?<br> - Sure were.<br> - How could he tell?<br> - By looking at them.<br> And then we went out to Sacramento<br> and filed a complaint<br> with the commissioner.<br> - What happened?<br> - Nothing.<br> I'm going to start doing some running.<br> If I get into shape, I know I can still fight.<br> Why don't you, then?<br> - I'm gonna.<br> - Yeah, sure. I heard that one before.<br> - I am.<br> - Sure, sure.<br> - Screw you!<br> - Up yours, cowboy!<br> Onion toppers, over here.<br> Onion toppers, over here.<br> Come on here.<br> Hey, Ernie.<br> - Hey, how are you?<br> - Hey.<br> - What are you doing out here?<br> - I got a bum-paying job, wife's pregnant.<br> I came down to pick up a few extra bucks.<br> I run into a mob like this.<br> Well, come on, come on, come on.<br> I'll try and get you on.<br> - Oh, beautiful.<br> - You like walnuts?<br> Yeah. They're great.<br> Hey, did you ever go over to the gym<br> and see Ruben?<br> - Yeah. I fought for a while.<br> - Yeah? How'd you do?<br> - Well, I won some, lost some.<br> - Good. Keep it up, man, you got the stuff.<br> - Hey, I brought you a real hustler.<br> - You go out yesterday?<br> Yeah. I was the tree-beater.<br> I'll wait and see<br> if all of yesterday's crew comes back.<br> Listen, man, you're making a big mistake<br> if you pass this guy up.<br> I'll give you my personal voucher.<br> Get on, both of you.<br> Ernie?<br> You must think I'm crazy working out here<br> like this, wasting my time.<br> But I tell you something, it's almost as good<br> as roadwork for getting back into shape.<br> And you get paid for it.<br> Another couple of weeks,<br> I'm gonna look for a fight.<br> I get the fight, I get the money,<br> and I send for my wife.<br> You know, Ernie,<br> there are some women<br> that love you for yourself,<br> but that doesn't last long.<br> Ernie...<br> Take care of that wife of yours.<br> Oh, God, I'm trying.<br> And listen,<br> don't you let anybody knock marriage.<br> No, no, man. It's got its compensations.<br> That's a fact. That's absolutely right.<br> It's got its compensations. That's it.<br> That's absolutely it.<br> It has got its compensations. That's right.<br> Come here, I want to show you something.<br> That's stacked, man.<br> I gotta get myself together and get down<br> to the gym and start working out.<br> Hey, maybe we could<br> go down to the gym together.<br> Shit, I'll go down there with you.<br> Well, look, I was in bad shape the last time,<br> but I can do it. I can get back into shape.<br> I mean,<br> you should have seen the things we had.<br> The new car and the house and everything.<br> I am going to be bad news this time around.<br> Bad news.<br> Time, time.<br> You're not jabbing right.<br> You gotta use your jab more.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, Gil, how are you doing?<br> Ruben, look who's here.<br> Well, will you look at this.<br> - Ruben.<br> - Glad to see you, man.<br> Looking good, looking good.<br> How's it going?<br> Will you look at this?<br> - You're looking good.<br> - How's it going?<br> - Hey, how are you?<br> - Long time no see.<br> How did you guys find your way up here?<br> Where've you been?<br> What have you been doing?<br> Picking nuts.<br> What else? You don't care what kind<br> of company you keep, do you?<br> - Heard you got married.<br> - Yeah.<br> Wow, how do you like that? Come on, time.<br> Listen, I want to pay you back<br> that $20 I borrowed from you.<br> What?<br> I borrowed $20 from you, remember?<br> - Yeah, but that was a long time ago.<br> - Yeah, I know, but I want you to take it.<br> - You sure you can spare it?<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> You come up to work out?<br> I want to start fighting again.<br> You're really gonna get into shape?<br> I'm really going to get into shape.<br> You can do it, baby, you can do it.<br> You're really looking good.<br> You look great. Get into your gym clothes.<br> Give me that.<br> Mac, how are you? How's business?<br> Listen, I got something hot for you.<br> Billy Tully's back in training.<br> I'll tell you what I'd like for him.<br> A good tune-up fight.<br> Who'd pay to see Tully in a tune-up fight?<br> Oh, he looks terrific, Mac.<br> I mean, with a couple of good wins,<br> he's ready for anybody.<br> I don't mean you should<br> match him with some bum,<br> but, you know, somebody<br> who will give him a good workout.<br> Tully won't draw.<br> He's a good clean athlete, Mac,<br> with a fine record.<br> Maybe I can use him in a semi-windup.<br> Oh, a semi-windup.<br> No, I can't put him in a semi.<br> He's still got the old stuff. He's got class.<br> He won't draw.<br> Look, we can put a hometown boy<br> in every bout.<br> I got a fine Irish kid that could<br> turn pro for the opener.<br> How about Arcadio Lucero?<br> I could use Tully in a main event with him.<br> Lucero... I don't know. Lucero's a puncher.<br> What I meant was a good tune-up.<br> Mac, why should I put him in with Lucero?<br> It might be different if he had<br> a couple of good tune-ups first.<br> I think I can get you Lucero.<br> Not that I think that he could ever nail Tully.<br> Well, I tell you, I think I can get Lucero.<br> It would be a good win on his record.<br> I could phone Mexico City<br> and see if he's available.<br> Supper's almost ready.<br> Okay.<br> - Can I have a robe?<br> - What?<br> Can I have a robe?<br> How do you like your steak?<br> I don't care.<br> Is Earl out of the bucket?<br> - What?<br> - His box is gone.<br> - Earl's box?<br> - Did Earl come over here today?<br> - Yep.<br> - Why didn't you tell me so?<br> I just woke up.<br> I haven't had a chance to open my mouth.<br> - Yeah.<br> - He just picked up his stuff and he left.<br> After he found out<br> he couldn't move back in, huh?<br> He didn't mention moving in.<br> Then why'd he come over?<br> I told you, to get his clothes.<br> He already knew you and I were together.<br> How'd he know that?<br> What are all these questions?<br> He came by today, he got out.<br> - Why didn't you tell me?<br> - I guess I forgot.<br> Yeah, that's a good one.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - I heard what you said.<br> - Then why'd you ask?<br> You don't trust me, do you?<br> Look, Oma,<br> all I'm trying to do is cook our supper.<br> Oh, aren't you wonderful.<br> If I didn't cook it, we wouldn't eat.<br> - Nobody asked you to fix me any supper.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> You'd just as soon drink yours.<br> You don't want to fix me any,<br> then you don't have to.<br> I'm making it for you.<br> Then I won't eat it<br> if you feel that way about it.<br> I want you to eat it.<br> I cooked it, because I want you to eat!<br> I didn't say anything,<br> and you have to go and get mad.<br> Jesus Christ, Oma, come on,<br> eat your supper before it gets cold.<br> I don't take orders from you.<br> You need your protein.<br> I'm not going to eat with somebody<br> that talks to me the way you do.<br> You want to starve to death?<br> That'd solve everything for you, wouldn't it?<br> Oma, I just asked you a simple question.<br> Jesus.<br> Come on,<br> eat your dinner before it gets cold.<br> Maybe I don't want to eat.<br> All right, forget it. Just forget it.<br> Go on, go hungry if you want to.<br> I make you a good dinner, you don't even<br> appreciate it. You know, this is good food.<br> Go ahead and starve to death, see if I care.<br> Just forget about it.<br> All right, I'll have a little.<br> - No, I don't want you to.<br> - No, I want it.

I'm going to eat.<br> - I don't want you to eat it.<br> - Why won't you let me eat my dinner?<br> All right.<br> Eat.<br> Well?<br> - How do you like it?<br> - What?<br> Nothing. Forget it.<br> Oh, for Christ's sake, don't ask something<br> and then not even say what you mean.<br> - Your supper.<br> - All right.<br> It's fine.<br> I thought maybe you'd know what I meant<br> since you're not having any trouble<br> eating it.<br> Nobody can eat<br> with you sitting across the table.<br> All right, Oma.<br> I give up.<br> All I've been trying to do is<br> get you to eat your supper.<br> If you don't want my company,<br> just say so, I'll let you alone.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Take a walk around the block.<br> - Can I go with you?<br> - No.<br> Let you eat in peace, if that's what you want.<br> You're going to go out for a drink,<br> and you're going to leave me here?<br> I'm fighting in a week.<br> Do you think I'd take a drink?<br> Billy, wait a minute, let me get my shoes.<br> Billy, wait. Billy, wait, please!<br> - Hello.<br> - Is that you, Ruben?<br> Who is this speaking?<br> You know something? You're not worried<br> about me and I don't give a damn about you.<br> You never will give a damn,<br> so why should I?<br> You know, if you'd gone down to Panama<br> with me, everything would be different.<br> Listen, where are you? What's the problem?<br> What do you mean, what is the problem?<br> What's your problem?<br> Well, just hold on. Where are you?<br> What's wrong?<br> Hi, Billy.<br> Hello, Ruben.<br> What are you doing out on the town?<br> Hey, hey, Ruben, can I buy you a drink?<br> No, nothing, Billy, nothing.<br> Hey, Ruben, I'm really glad to see you.<br> I need somebody to talk to.<br> I need your good advice. I am in a mess.<br> What's the trouble?<br> Oh, this woman of mine.<br> She's just off her gourd.<br> I can't take it any more.<br> I need my peace of mind.<br> - I'm training for a fight.<br> - Is that so?<br> Yeah.<br> I can't take it any more, Ruben.<br> I can't even sleep in the same bed with her.<br> Every time she opens her mouth,<br> I think I'm going to go crazy.<br> She's a lush.<br> Leave her. You can stay at my place tonight.<br> I wish I could. It's not that easy.<br> All my clothes are over there.<br> I'll get you some clothes,<br> and I'll give you an advance.<br> But if you're really going to leave her, Billy,<br> you leave her right now.<br> Right now!<br> You're right. You're dead right.<br> You're right. I know you're right, Ruben.<br> Come on,<br> I'll get you a room somewhere tomorrow.<br> All right. She's just destroying me, Rube.<br> Hey, listen to me, wait a minute now.<br> I want to tell you something.<br> Ever since my wife left me,<br> it's just been one mess after another.<br> You know,<br> the only time I was ever really happy I...<br> You know something, Ruben?<br> In four days I'm going to be 30.<br> - Come on, let's go.<br> - All right.<br> Come on, attaboy, all right.<br> Okay, baby. Come on.<br> You know, I really appreciate it, Rube.<br> The Lodi-Sacramento bus is<br> now loading passengers.<br> Please remain inside the terminal<br> until the driver picks up your tickets<br> at door number four.<br> Billy, you better start to warm up.<br> - Okay.<br> - Hurry up, will you, Babe...<br> - You're on right now.<br> - Don't get excited, Mac.<br> - How do you feel, Tully?<br> - I feel okay.<br> - Is he all clear with the doctor?<br> - He's all set.

Tie him up.<br> Stick him in the ribs.<br> All right, seconds out, seconds out.<br> Break, break. Move, move.<br> Winner by technical knockout,<br> time, two minutes and thirteen seconds<br> of the third round,<br> Billy Tully!<br> - Did I get knocked out?<br> - No, we won, we won.<br> You won, baby, you won.<br> Here he is.<br> There he is.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Congratulations, Billy.<br> Kiss him, honey, kiss him.<br> - Congratulations, Billy.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You put on a good fight, Tully.<br> - Thank you.<br> Good fight? This guy is sensational.<br> He just pulled the upset of the year.<br> This guy is great.<br> I defy anybody to say this guy is not great.<br> First fight in two years,<br> and he gets himself in perfect condition.<br> He doesn't smoke, Mac, you know that?<br> Never touches tobacco.<br> He's ready for anybody.<br> We got a real winner here.<br> He's the most colourful attraction<br> in Northern California.<br> What'd you think of this kid, huh?<br> Wasn't he fantastic?<br> First pro fight and he's cool as ice in there.<br> Ernie.<br> Don't give it all to them baby doctors.<br> Real good.

Come on.<br> He looked good out there.<br> That third round...<br> We earned $241.<br> You've been off too long, Billy.<br> Next time, you'll draw three times that much.<br> - What's my cut come to?<br> - Well, I gave you all those advances.<br> I gotta collect some of that.<br> We got you on your feet now.<br> In three or four weeks,<br> you'll be ready to go again. I'll tell you what,<br> why don't I just keep paying<br> your room and board?<br> Well, I'm not drinking any more.<br> I know, Billy, I know.<br> Well, Ruben, I'm not going to blow any of it.<br> Look, you take your cut<br> and just let me pay my own bills. Okay?<br> Anything you say.<br> There you go.<br> Only 100 bucks? That's all my sweat<br> and blood is worth? A lousy 100 bucks!<br> Ruben, it's hardly worth the trouble.<br> I gave you those advances, Billy,<br> with the agreement<br> that they'd come out of your purse.<br> I got four kids. Now, once we make<br> another match, I'll stake you...<br> - Oh, yeah...<br> - Don't get out that door, you'll get run over.<br> Get out this door.<br> Why'd you want to do that for?<br> Why didn't you slide over?<br> - Yeah, what do you care?<br> - You can get run into out there.<br> You're just looking out for me<br> every minute, aren't you?<br> Except when it comes time to pay off.<br> I'll talk to Mac, and he'll put you<br> on again in two or three weeks.<br> - With this cut?<br> - It'll heal.<br> You know where I got this cut, Ruben?<br> This is the same place<br> they cut me with that razor blade<br> when you sent me down<br> to Panama to fight Soto all by myself,<br> 'cause you were too tight to come down<br> there and work in my corner.<br> That's not old scar tissue, Billy.<br> It's a new cut.<br> Yeah, that's what you say, all right.<br> Would you get out<br> of the middle of the road?<br> What you want?<br> - I just come to get my things.<br> - I live here. And I pay the rent.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Got your things in a box.<br> They're all ready to go.<br> Christ, Mary and Joseph, look who's here.<br> Hi.<br> I'm wearing one of your T-shirts.<br> I'll take it off for you.<br> Oh, that's all right. Don't bother.<br> I got plenty.<br> I got my own. Just wasn't none clean today.<br> What's yours is yours.<br> Oma wanted me to throw your stuff out.<br> But I say a man's stuff is his stuff.<br> When he shows up around here,<br> I want to send him off<br> with what he come for.<br> - You can take that box and shove it.<br> - You hush now.<br> He just come for his things and he's leaving.<br> Don't you hush me, you bunch of bums.<br> - What do you know about it, anyway?<br> - Don't listen to her. She's been drinking.<br> Get that garbage out of here.<br> You see, we've been<br> out on the town tonight.<br> Take the shirt off a man's back.<br> If that isn't just so perfect.<br> - If that isn't just like him.<br> - She just likes to blow off steam.<br> Don't listen to her. We get along.<br> How I handle her,<br> I just don't pay her no mind.<br> The thing you got to understand about her,<br> she's a juice head.<br> I know. She won't eat, either.<br> Yeah. That's on account of her unhappy life<br> and all that shit.<br> Nothing I can do about that.<br> So I don't let it worry me none.<br> Look like you had you a fight.<br> How you come out?<br> - I won.<br> - Is that right?<br> I've seen you on the posters.<br> I like to catch a good fight now and then.<br> - Maybe I'll catch you some time.<br> - Good.<br> But I don't need you coming around here<br> no more. She don't want to see you.<br> Oma, you want to see this man?<br> Christ!<br> - You see how it is?<br> - Yes.<br> You got your stuff.<br> You got a match?<br> Ernie?<br> Hey, Ernie.<br> - Hey, man.<br> - Hey, how's it going?<br> - All right. How you doing?<br> - All right.<br> You look like you had a fight.<br> Yeah. Just won a decision over in Reno.<br> Is that right? Well, congratulations.<br> - Nice going. Why don't we have a drink?<br> - Oh, no, not for me.<br> - Hey, how you been keeping, man?<br> - Come on.<br> No, I got to get home to my wife and kid.<br> What's the matter? You won't even<br> have a drink with your old buddy.<br> Man, I don't drink.<br> Yeah, I know. You only win decisions.<br> Do you know how many KO's<br> I had in a row?<br> A whole long string.<br> You mind if I say something personal?<br> - No, go ahead.<br> - Can I be frank?<br> 'Cause it's just my own opinion.<br> You remember that first time<br> that we met down at the YMCA?<br> Well, I said to myself then, I said,<br> "Now there's a guy<br> that is soft in the centre."<br> Oh, no, forget it.<br> Right, fine, congratulations. Hey, listen,<br> you got everything going for you.<br> You know that?<br> You're young, and you got a wife,<br> - and you got a kid.<br> - A little boy.<br> Yeah, and you got a good reach, too.<br> - Hey, no hard feelings, huh?<br> - No, man. No hard feelings.<br> You're right about that drink.<br> But can I buy you a cup of coffee?<br> Yeah. Let's go get some coffee.<br> - So why haven't you been training?<br> - I've been thinking about it.<br> - Coffee?<br> - Same, please.<br> How'd you like to wake up<br> in the morning and be him?<br> Jesus, the waste.<br> Before you can get rolling,<br> your life makes a beeline for the drain.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Thank you.<br> Maybe he's happy.<br> Maybe we're all happy.<br> Right?<br> Do you think he was ever young once?<br> No.<br> Maybe he wasn't.<br> Hey, buddy, I'm going to take off.<br> Hey, stick around. Talk a while.<br> Okay.<br>
