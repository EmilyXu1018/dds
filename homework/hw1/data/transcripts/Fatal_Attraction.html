Is there<br> something in his past we can find?<br> We need to use some leverage.<br> Give me a break!<br> Come on.<br> - Is it made in Taiwan?<br> - These are tough to find.<br> Oh, wait, wait. Here.<br> We got one.<br> Come on!<br> You wanna go get a drink?<br> Yeah, I'd love it.<br> The strangest case I ever handled?<br> Well, the truth was<br> I never actually handled it...<br> but the strangest case<br> I ever came near to...<br> was when my parents got divorced<br> and my mother asked me to represent her.<br> - You're kidding.<br> - That's what I said.<br> "What do you mean?" she told me.<br> "You know what an asshole the guy is.<br> You've been a witness to this marriage<br> for 29 years."<br> Can you believe this?<br> This is coming from my mother.<br> - How did you get out of it?<br> - You can't turn your mother down.<br> So, I escaped on a technicality.<br> - Which was what?<br> - I didn't practice family law.<br> And it was true, you know,<br> and she bought it.<br> - Are you making this up?<br> - Could I make something up like that?<br> Waiter.<br> I've got a lot of pull here.<br> My favorite restaurant.<br> - I noticed.<br> - They know me well.<br> Miss. You want a coffee?<br> Can we have two coffees, please?<br> Well, I'll tell you, it's...<br> - You want one?<br> - No, thank you.<br> It's funny being a lawyer.<br> It's like being a doctor.<br> Everybody is telling you<br> their innermost secrets.<br> Oh, God.<br> You must have to be discreet.<br> Oh, God, yeah.<br> Are you?<br> Am I what?<br> Discreet.<br> Yes, I'm discreet.<br> Me too.<br> - Can I ask you something?<br> - What?<br> - Why don't you have a date tonight?<br> - I did have a date.<br> I stood him up.<br> That was the phone call I made.<br> Does that make you feel good?<br> It doesn't make me feel bad.<br> So, where's your wife?<br> Where's my wife?<br> My wife is in the country with<br> her parents, visiting for the weekend.<br> And you're here with a strange girl<br> being a naughty boy.<br> I don't think having dinner<br> with anybody is a crime.<br> Not yet.<br> Will it be?<br> I don't know.<br> What do you think?<br> I definitely think<br> it's gonna be up to you.<br> I can't say yet.<br> I haven't made up my mind.<br> At least you're very honest.<br> We were attracted to each other<br> at the party. That was obvious.<br> You're on your own for the night.<br> That's also obvious.<br> We're two adults.<br> Let's get the check.<br> - Oh, that was great.<br> - Thank God.<br> Are you feeling energetic?<br> What do you have in mind?<br> You live in this building?<br> Well, where can I get a cab?<br> Do you know?<br> - Have you ever done it in an elevator?<br> - Not recently.<br> I'll bet you haven't.<br> I'm sorry, baby.<br> I'm sorry.<br> How are you?<br> Hi. What happened to you?<br> I tried you earlier. I'm gonna go...<br> I guess you're not back yet.<br> I'm gonna go to bed now,<br> so call me in the morning. Bye-bye.<br> Oh, Dan, darling.<br> We were expecting you.<br> I had work to do.<br> That's a pity. We really<br> wanted you to see that house.<br> - I'll see it next time.<br> - Of course. You wanna speak to Beth?<br> Hold on a second.<br> The phone. It's Dan.<br> Here you are.<br> Hello.<br> What happened to you?<br> Hi. Nothing. I just went out<br> and had dinner with Bill last night.<br> How is he?<br> He's... Bill's Bill,<br> the same as usual.<br> Is he still with that girl?<br> Well, he wasn't last night.<br> I think it's over.<br> He didn't wanna talk about it.<br> So, you getting any work done?<br> Yeah, I'm working.<br> There's some of the spaghetti sauce<br> in the refrigerator if you get hungry.<br> Great. Okay.<br> How's Ellen doing?<br> She is having the best time.<br> I just hope that Dad survives it.<br> Honey, I don't know<br> how to tell you this, but...<br> she wants a rabbit.<br> No rabbits!<br> Jesus Christ! This goddamn family's<br> turning into Noah's ark.<br> I mean, please, give her a kiss,<br> all right? But no promises.<br> - All right.<br> - When are you coming home?<br> - Well, it's getting complicated.<br> - Why's that?<br> There's a problem with the house.<br> They sold it?<br> Very funny. No, we can't get in<br> to see it until late this afternoon.<br> I'm not up to fighting the traffic.<br> I thought I would come in tomorrow.<br> What about school?<br> She's only five years old.<br> What's she going to miss, trigonometry?<br> Okay, all right. Then I'll see you<br> when I get home from work.<br> Okay. See you tomorrow.<br> Okay. Thanks.<br> Have a good time.<br> Bye.<br> What happened?<br> I woke up, you weren't here.<br> I hate that.<br> You didn't get my note?<br> What note?<br> I left you a note<br> right by your bed.<br> That's nice.<br> I thought we were gonna<br> spend the day together.<br> Alex, I got so much work<br> to do today. I can't.<br> Why don't you just come over.<br> I'll cook us lunch.<br> I got to take the dog for a walk.<br> The poor dog has not been out all day.<br> I gotta take him out.<br> Bring the dog. I love animals.<br> I'm a great cook.<br> Come on.<br> Listen. I'd love to, but I can't.<br> I really can't.<br> Do what you have to do,<br> then come over afterwards.<br> We can always eat late.<br> Or you can work here.<br> I won't disturb you, I promise.<br> I'll be a good girl.<br> You don't give up, do you?<br> You just don't give up.<br> Come on, Quincy.<br> Help, Quincy.<br> I got it. I got it.<br> He's free.<br> Quincy, cover me.<br> I'm up. Go deep.<br> He fires.<br> Throws.<br> She got it.<br> Yes, it's back.<br> Over the head.<br> He's got it.<br> Dan, can you hear me?<br> Oh, my God.<br> - You bastard.<br> - Your face.<br> - That was a shitty thing to do.<br> - I'm sorry. I was just fooling around.<br> My father died of a heart attack.<br> I was seven years old.<br> It happened right in front of me.<br> Honey, I'm sorry.<br> Really, I had no idea. If I did,<br> I never would have done that.<br> What, he didn't die?<br> He's alive?<br> Yeah, he's alive and well<br> and living in Phoenix.<br> You certainly got me,<br> didn't you?<br> Let's hear it.<br> I hope you like spaghetti.<br> Specialty of the house.<br> Goes with the opera.<br> It smells so good.<br> - Anything else for me to do?<br> - No, nothing.<br> Just make yourself at home.<br> You can change the tape.<br> No, this is great.<br> I love Madame Butterfly.<br> Really?<br> It's my favorite opera.<br> Mine too.<br> First opera I ever saw.<br> My father, he took me to the old Met.<br> I was five years old.<br> Did it make any sense?<br> I got most of it.<br> There was this US sailor settin' up<br> house with this Japanese lady.<br> That was all fine,<br> but in the final act...<br> after he left her...<br> my father told me<br> she's gonna kill herself...<br> and I was terrified.<br> I was... I climbed<br> right underneath the chair.<br> It's right here.<br> This is it.<br> It's funny.<br> What?<br> One of the only times I recall my father<br> being nice to me when I was a kid...<br> comforting me at Madame Butterfly.<br> What?<br> What are you thinking about?<br> I was wondering why is it that all the<br> interesting guys are always married?<br> Maybe that's why you find them<br> interesting... you can't have them.<br> How long have you been married?<br> Nine years.<br> Do you have any kids?<br> I got a six-year-old girl.<br> Sounds good.<br> I'm lucky.<br> So what are you doing here?<br> You know how to ask them.<br> I really wanna know.<br> I had a wonderful time last night.<br> I'd like to see you again.<br> Is that so terrible?<br> No.<br> I just don't think<br> it's possible, though.<br> It's really strange.<br> I feel like I know you already.<br> I just wanna know where I stand.<br> I think you're terrific.<br> But I'm married.<br> What can I say?<br> Just my luck.<br> Oh, shit.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I gotta go.<br> I thought you said she wasn't<br> coming back till tomorrow.<br> She's not, but I got things to do.<br> I gotta go home.<br> I don't think I like this.<br> Like what?<br> The way you run away<br> after every time we make love.<br> What difference does it make<br> whether I leave now or in the morning?<br> - The fact is I gotta go.<br> - You're not gonna leave now.<br> - Come on. Will you stop it?<br> - I mean it!<br> Come on. Hey!<br> What's the problem?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Jesus Christ.<br> I mean, let's be reasonable.<br> Be reasonable?<br> What?<br> "Thank you. Good-bye.<br> Don't call me. I'll call you."<br> Look, you knew about me,<br> all right.<br> I didn't hide anything.<br> - I thought it was understood.<br> - What was understood?<br> The opportunity was there<br> and we took it.<br> Come on now.<br> We are adults, aren't we?<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> - I thought we'd have a good time.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> You thought you'd have a good time.<br> You didn't stop to think about me.<br> That's crazy.<br> You knew the rules.<br> What rules?<br> Look. I like you.<br> And if I wasn't with somebody else,<br> then maybe I'd be with you, but I am.<br> Please don't justify yourself.<br> It's pathetic.<br> If you told me to fuck off,<br> I'd have more respect for you.<br> All right then. Fuck off.<br> And you get out!<br> I'm going.<br> Why don't you come over here<br> and say good-bye nicely?<br> Let's be friends.<br> Baby, no.<br> It's okay.<br> Sorry if I upset you.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay, really.<br> It's okay. All right.<br> It's okay now.<br> Your hands are all wet.<br> Oh, Jesus!<br> Jesus Christ!<br> Come here, come here!<br> Hold on, hold on.<br> Nice and tight.<br> Hi. Did you just call me?<br> I was in the shower and I heard<br> the phone. I thought it was you.<br> So how are you?<br> Did you have a good day?<br> Really?<br> That's terrific.<br> That's really terrific.<br> You sound excited.<br> No, I'm not against the idea.<br> Don't get me wrong.<br> It's just the money.<br> Okay, darling.<br> I love you.<br> Bye.<br> How are you feeling?<br> Okay.<br> I gotta go.<br> Will you call me sometime?<br> You don't have to<br> if you don't want to.<br> No, I want to.<br> You promise me<br> you're gonna go see the doctor.<br> Good-bye.<br> You take care.<br> You too.<br> Shit.<br> Look what I got.<br> Look what I got for you here?<br> A little spaghetti and meat sauce.<br> That's it, buddy.<br> We'll make an Italian out of you yet.<br> That's a good boy.<br> All right.<br> Have a good one.<br> What are you doing here?<br> It's 8:00 a.m.<br> I'm in the shitter, Martha. I gotta be<br> in court by 2:00 and I'm really behind.<br> Do me a favor. Cancel everything<br> and call Drimmer. Tell him we're fine.<br> - I'll be there by 2:00.<br> - At 2:00? Okay.<br> Good morning, Martha.<br> - Daddy!<br> - Hey, honey! Oh, God, I missed you.<br> We had a great time. We went for a walk<br> with Grandpa and saw rabbits.<br> Well, good. Why don't you slow down.<br> I can't understand a word you're saying.<br> - Daddy, I want a rabbit.<br> - I know you do, honey.<br> - Hi, darling. How are you?<br> - Good.<br> Oh, God, I missed you.<br> Liar.<br> I did.<br> I should go away more often.<br> - I did this one.<br> - You did?<br> - Pick another one.<br> - I thought it was this row you picked.<br> - It was this one.<br> - I think you're in a lot of trouble.<br> Phooey. I can't do it.<br> Now pick a card, Dad.<br> Any card at all?<br> - Of course.<br> - Where'd she learn this?<br> Grandpa showed me.<br> It's a surprise.<br> So, how was it?<br> Come on. I'm a big boy.<br> I can take it.<br> It had a place for rabbits.<br> Oh, no! She said it.<br> She said the "R" word.<br> Not rabbits? Rabbits?<br> Well, what can I tell you?<br> It's absolutely perfect.<br> In this row?<br> So, when are you gonna come up<br> and take a look at it?<br> - Just for the hell of it?<br> - In this row?<br> How about tomorrow morning?<br> - Daddy, which row?<br> - You mean it?<br> If you can get me back<br> to the office by 1:00, yeah.<br> Which row, Dad?<br> It's in this row, sweetheart.<br> Honey?<br> Honey, come here.<br> I want you to see this.<br> Well?<br> Well, it's... it's okay.<br> What do you mean?<br> It's fantastic.<br> It's great.<br> Just think of all the money<br> we're gonna save not living in New York.<br> The local high school is excellent.<br> My own children went there.<br> - You see?<br> - This is a terrific area for kids.<br> I'm sure it is.<br> Is it okay if I go upstairs?<br> - Go ahead. I'll wait for you down here.<br> - Thank you.<br> You know,<br> we still gotta decorate.<br> We can fix up anything.<br> We can have painting parties.<br> Painting parties?<br> Beth, you're making me very nervous.<br> Now look at this.<br> This is fantastic.<br> This would make a terrific playroom.<br> What are you talking about playroom?<br> This is my den. It's a den.<br> I knew you were gonna like it.<br> I like it.<br> I'll be in court.<br> How you doing, Dan?<br> Hi, Eunice.<br> Did Martha get back from lunch?<br> - She just returned.<br> - Thank you.<br> This isn't a bad time, is it?<br> I was in the area.<br> No. No. You...<br> Do you wanna come in my office?<br> You gonna be in your office later?<br> There's a little something... Excuse me.<br> - Haven't we met somewhere?<br> - I don't think so.<br> She looked at me first.<br> Sit down.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - I'm fine.<br> I was gonna call you today.<br> This is terribly embarrassing.<br> I just wanted to say sorry<br> for what happened.<br> I had no right<br> to put you through that.<br> Nothing happened, okay?<br> I was going through a bad time<br> and everything was coming to a crisis.<br> But I'm fine. I'm really all right.<br> And thank you.<br> - You don't have to thank me.<br> - Oh, yeah, I do.<br> A lot of guys<br> would have just run away.<br> I don't know what I would have done<br> if you hadn't been there.<br> Well, you... you look good.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> you look great.<br> Thanks.<br> So that's past?<br> - May I ask you one more favor?<br> - What's that?<br> I've got two tickets<br> to Madame Butterfly...<br> two weeks from Thursday.<br> I'd really love it if you'd come<br> with me, kind of as a peace offering.<br> That's... That's very nice of you...<br> but I don't think it's a good idea.<br> No strings attached.<br> You don't have to explain.<br> I just thought I'd ask.<br> So...<br> I'll see you around sometime.<br> Come here.<br> Take care.<br> Good-bye.<br> Let's go, pal!<br> We're on a roll.<br> We're on a roll.<br> I like it.<br> Very nice.<br> That is no good.<br> How about Rodgers<br> versus whatchamacallit?<br> - Winitsky.<br> - Right. I got your memo.<br> - You gonna go for summary judgment?<br> - Why not, Arthur?<br> The facts are not in dispute. Rodgers<br> admits reading Winitsky's article.<br> The question is whether<br> he plagiarized it in his book.<br> You can't copyright an idea,<br> only the expression of the idea...<br> and Rodgers sure as hell didn't use<br> any of the words in the book.<br> Let me think about it.<br> So, I hear you're about<br> to become a suburbanite.<br> We're gonna take the big plunge.<br> - Got a buyer for the apartment?<br> - No.<br> - Got cold sweats about your escrow?<br> - Yeah.<br> But not about Rodgers<br> versus Winitsky?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Good.<br> He's still in a meeting.<br> Yes, I know. I did expect him<br> to be through by now.<br> I'd like you to have lunch with me<br> on Tuesday, if you're around.<br> Thank you, Arthur. That'd be great.<br> Let me just check my diary.<br> You are on his list of calls.<br> It's Alex Forest.<br> Again? I thought you told her<br> I'd call her back.<br> - I did.<br> - Put her on hold.<br> Would you mind holding?<br> - Tuesday would be great.<br> - I look forward to it.<br> Thank you. I will too.<br> Put her through.<br> Look, Alex, I thought we agreed<br> this was not a good idea.<br> Why?<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought you understood.<br> If I misled you in some way,<br> I apologize.<br> But I don't think it's a good idea<br> if we talk to each other anymore.<br> Okay?<br> Good-bye.<br> If she calls again,<br> tell her I'm not here.<br> Thank you.<br> Wait. Let me do something.<br> Let me just look at you.<br> You're so beautiful.<br> You're just so beautiful.<br> - Wouldn't you know.<br> - I know.<br> Do you know how many injuries can...<br> - That's my wife!<br> - Don't terrorize them.<br> I'm a lawyer. I'm insured.<br> Oh, it's excited.<br> Now don't forget who gave you this.<br> My cold sores are almost gone.<br> This is for you. Ladies first.<br> I use that term advisedly.<br> You bet, sweetie.<br> That's my wife!<br> A little attention, please.<br> Ladies. Gentleman.<br> My wife.<br> My little ball and chain.<br> - You should have such a ball and chain.<br> - Mother of some of my children.<br> - Wouldn't be that confident about it.<br> - Here is to Miller, Goodman...<br> Hurst and Gallagher.<br> - Here's to Mrs. Gallagher.<br> - Give me a break, will you, guys?<br> All he did was ask me to lunch.<br> Your moving to your country estate.<br> You'll forget you ever knew us.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I read one of those self-help books.<br> Published by Robbins and Hart,<br> of course.<br> Samurai Self-Help.<br> In it, it tells you how to deal<br> with the anxieties of your friends...<br> as you move up the corporate ladder<br> and they stay put...<br> or, God forbid, go down.<br> And in this book, it tells you<br> not to coddle your friends' anxieties.<br> So I'm not gonna make<br> any false reassurances, guys.<br> I'm not gonna tell you you're gonna be<br> up to the house every weekend.<br> Let's face it. Things have changed.<br> This is not a classless society.<br> As a matter of fact, this is it.<br> Good-bye. Good-bye.<br> I knew he was gonna say that.<br> The man is running true to form.<br> Honey, I think we gotta make<br> a clean break.<br> We're on a roll.<br> We gotta travel light.<br> Thanks for the time you've given us.<br> Here, you, drink. I want you<br> with a lamp shade on your head by 10:00.<br> Why should today be any different<br> from any other?<br> Here's to you.<br> Yeah, Richards.<br> It's kind of late, isn't it?<br> If you refuse to take my phone calls<br> at the office, you leave me no choice.<br> It's 2:00 in the morning.<br> Can't this wait till tomorrow morning?<br> Is it awkward for you to talk?<br> You could say that.<br> I've gotta see you.<br> I don't have the...<br> the documentation to answer that right<br> now, but I'll call you from the office.<br> No. Meet me in front of the Robbins<br> and Hart building tomorrow, 6:00.<br> Don't disappoint me.<br> Be there.<br> - This has gotta stop.<br> - If you saw me, I wouldn't call.<br> Do you get it? It's over.<br> There's nothing between us.<br> You mean you've had your fun.<br> Now you just want a quiet life.<br> - Why are you doing this?<br> - Doing what?<br> - You need help.<br> - Don't tell me what I need.<br> You need a shrink!<br> Why are you so hostile?<br> I'm not your enemy.<br> - Then why are you trying to hurt me?<br> - I'm not. I love you.<br> - You what?<br> - I love you.<br> - You don't even know me.<br> - How can you say that?<br> We spent a weekend together,<br> that's all.<br> You stayed that second night.<br> You must like me a little.<br> Because I was concerned about you.<br> Why do you read so much into everything?<br> Can't you understand? I have<br> a whole relationship with someone else.<br> I am very happy.<br> Whole means complete.<br> If your life's so damn complete,<br> what were you doing with me?<br> - Is that what you wanna talk about?<br> - I'm pregnant.<br> I saw my gynecologist on Monday.<br> Here's his card.<br> You can call him.<br> You don't...<br> Use anything?<br> I had a very bad miscarriage last year.<br> I didn't think I could get pregnant.<br> How do you know it's mine?<br> Because I don't sleep around.<br> I apologize.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Don't worry. You're not gonna<br> have to handle this alone.<br> Handle what?<br> The abortion. I'll take care of it.<br> I'll pay for it.<br> What makes you think<br> I want an abortion?<br> You're not gonna have the baby.<br> Why not?<br> There are plenty<br> of one-parent families.<br> - At least they don't end in divorce.<br> - I don't have a say in this?<br> I want this child.<br> It has nothing to do with you. I want it<br> whether you're a part of it or not.<br> Then why are you telling me?<br> Why not just go ahead and do it?<br> I was hoping that you would want<br> to be a part of it.<br> This is crazy.<br> This is totally insane.<br> I'm 36 years old. It may be<br> my last chance to have a child.<br> Just think what you're saying.<br> Just think about it.<br> We are gonna live with this<br> for the rest of our lives.<br> I know that.<br> I've thought of that.<br> I know how you feel.<br> It's a big thing,<br> but it doesn't have to be a problem.<br> Really, it doesn't.<br> You play fair with me,<br> I'll play fair with you.<br> "He led Agnes and Nellie<br> into the hall closet and shut the door.<br> Agnes and Nellie and Oink giggled<br> and laughed in the dark.<br> Pearl listened outside the door.<br> 'Oh, it works, ' cried Nellie.<br> 'Of course, ' said Oink.<br> 'Look at the flying dog, '<br> yelled Agnes.<br> 'Wow! ' cried Nellie.<br> Pearl frowned. 'Who cares<br> about flying dogs? ' she said.<br> Nobody heard her.<br> 'Look out for the worms! '<br> squealed Agnes.<br> 'Eeek! ' yelled Nellie<br> and Agnes together.<br> 'Look at the monster cockroach! '<br> yelled Oink.<br> 'Help!"'<br> So you know what I did?<br> I called the doctor.<br> You know what he says?<br> "Congratulations."<br> I can't even imagine<br> what she told him.<br> Anyway, that's not the end of it.<br> After I talk to the doctor...<br> this morning<br> I broke into her apartment.<br> I know. Me, a lawyer,<br> breaking and entering.<br> I'm looking for something, anything to<br> get a handle on what I'm dealing with.<br> I thought maybe I could find out<br> she was sleeping with somebody else.<br> Well, I didn't find anything.<br> Anyway, I didn't find anything.<br> Jimmy, I don't know anything<br> about family law.<br> You gotta help me.<br> What kind of case does she really have?<br> It ain't good.<br> She keeps calling the apartment.<br> Every time Beth answers the phone,<br> she hangs up.<br> I'm scared, Jimmy.
