                        I would like to say|a few words about weddings.<br> I've just been through one.<br> Not my own, my daughter's.<br> Someday in the far future...<br> ...I may be able to remember it|with tender indulgence, but not now.<br> I always used to think that|marriage was a simple affair.<br> Boy and girl meet, they fall in love,|get married, they have babies...<br> ...eventually the babies|grow up, meet other babies...<br> ...they fall in love and get married,|and so on and on and on.<br> Looked at that way, it's not only|simple, it's downright monotonous.<br> But I was wrong.|I figured without the wedding.<br> Now, you fathers will understand.<br> You have a little girl.|She looks up to you.<br> You're her oracle. You're her hero.<br> Then the day comes when she gets her first|permanent wave and goes to her first party.<br> And from that day on,|you're in a constant state of panic.<br> If the boys swarm around, you're in|a panic for fear she'll marry one of them.<br> If they don't swarm around,|you're in another kind of a panic...<br> ...and you wonder|what's the matter with her.<br> So you don't worry about it. You say,|I've got plenty of time to worry about that.<br> I'll just put off thinking about it.<br> And then suddenly it is upon you.<br> It was just three months ago,|exactly three months ago...<br> ...that the storm broke here. It was an|ordinary day, very much like any other day.<br> I had caught the commuters'|train home, as usual.<br> It was late, as usual.<br> We own our own home in the suburbs.|At least, we almost own it.<br> Had it built when my law firm|made me a full-fledged partner.<br> As usual, it was Ellie who was|the first to greet me.<br> She asked me what kind of a day I'd had and|I asked her what kind of a day she'd had.<br> And our Delilah,|she was always the same.<br> Another kitchen crisis,|but that's routine.<br> - Oh, hi, Dad.|- Hello, son.<br> - May I have the keys to the car?|- Yeah. Be careful.<br> Okay.<br> Good night.<br> As usual, Ben wanted the car.<br> Ben's a nice, steady boy in college,|studying engineering.<br> Hi, Pop.<br> Hi.<br> And Tommy.<br> No worry about him|except to try to keep him fed.<br> It was hi and goodbye that night,|but I'm used to that.<br> I was wondering if my daughter had|deserted us too when I heard her voice.<br> Pops! Pops!<br> - Hi, Pops.|- Kay was our only daughter.<br> I know a father's not supposed|to have favorites, but when it's Kay...<br> - You smell good.|- You like it?<br> - What's that?|- An atomizer.<br> Where'd you get it?|A present? Who from?<br> Oh, somebody.<br> What's happened to you?|You look different.<br> - I do?|- Yeah.<br> You look all lit up inside.<br> Not wearing your usual deadpan look, that|How did I ever get into this family? look.<br> Oh, Pops.<br> You've been taking the vitamins|Dr. Gray sent you, huh?<br> That's right.<br> I guess I'll get me|some of those vitamins.<br> I'll get it, Delilah!<br> What's the matter with her?|Acts kind of queer.<br> I don't know. Maybe she's in love.<br> Who would she be in love with?<br> - I haven't the wildest idea.|- You must have some idea to mention it.<br> Well...<br> Buckley.<br> - Who?|- Buckley.<br> - Buckley who?|- Oh, you know that boy.<br> Buckley. I don't know his last name.<br> - Never heard of him.|- He's been here again and again.<br> - Well, that doesn't mean anything.|- All right, I'm wrong.<br> Sorry. Forgive me.<br> - Who was it, dear?|- Buckley.<br> - He's coming for me in a few minutes.|- I'll get your coffee.<br> - Where'd the boys go?|- Ben had some date...<br> ...Tommy went to play basketball.|Delilah, bring the coffee.<br> - Yes, Mrs. Banks.|- Twenty wins.<br> - You'd think those boys could stay home.|- Ben's not a boy, Pops. He's a man.<br> - He's old enough to have a family.|- At 19?<br> Buckley says that's not|too young for a man to marry.<br> - I didn't marry your mother till I was 25.|- I know, but that was millions of years ago.<br> Look at the men in Ben's college.|Loads of them are married with children.<br> Gls.<br> Buckley says everyone|should marry young.<br> Did Buckley happen to mention who was|going to finance these child marriages?<br> He says the family should support them.|He says it's economy in the long run.<br> The men work better|and the babies are healthier.<br> From the way she talked|about Buckley, you'd think...<br> ... he was Moses, Einstein|and Gallup rolled into one.<br> I tried to remember which one he was.<br> There'd been so many boys who'd beat a|path to our door. Which one was Buckley?<br> Was it the boy with the teeth?<br> Or the guy with the porcupine hair?<br> Or the English teacher,|that poop-a-doop that Ellie liked?<br> I hoped he wasn't that muscle-bound|ham with the shoulders.<br> And she'd never fall|for that bebop hound.<br> And it couldn't be that genius who said he'd|fix my radio. She couldn't do that to me.<br> Couldn't be the radical.|She hadn't been on a picket line in years.<br> Surely my daughter wouldn't|fall for any of them.<br> Or would she?<br> She was still going on about him.<br> Buckley has it figured out. He says|there isn't going to be any depression.<br> I won't be home for the weekend.<br> Where are you going, dear?|I'm spending it with Buckley's family.<br> Are you going to marry this character?<br> I guess so.<br> And just when are you planning|on getting married?<br> Well, I really don't know yet, Mother.<br> It all depends on Buckley's plans.<br> It may be months, it may be a few|weeks, it may be anytime at all.<br> We can't tell yet.<br> But we won't be pinned down. Buckley's|very decided about that sort of thing.<br> He just won't be pinned down.<br> I hope that Buckley won't think I'm|too nosy if I ask a few simple questions.<br> Okay, Pops. I suppose|we have to go through this.<br> - Seems to me...|- Who is this Buckley anyway?<br> - Listen, Pops...|- What's his last name?<br> - I hope it's better than his first.|- Listen...<br> Where the devil is he from?<br> Who does he think will support him?|If he thinks I am, he's wrong!<br> - I don't give a hoot...|- Stanley! Stanley...<br> You don't have to shout. Nobody's deaf.|It's mortifying with right in there.<br> Please.<br> The idea.|Acting like an outraged father.<br> Sorry.<br> You broke it to me|so casually over the ice cream.<br> You might've|at least waited until coffee.<br> Oh, thanks, Delilah. I'll pour it.<br> You don't give Kay a chance.<br> Now listen, Pops. I'm 20 and|Buckley's 26, and we're grown people.<br> As far as you supporting us,|I'll tell you right now...<br> ...he's the kind that wouldn't let|anyone support him. He'd rather die first.<br> That's the kind of a person he is.|He's a wonderful person.<br> He's the kind of a person|that's absolutely...<br> I mean, absolutely independent.<br> Buckley wouldn't come to you for help,|not even if we were starving in the gutter.<br> And his name is Dunstan.<br> That's what it is. Buckley Dunstan.|And he's a wonderful businessman.<br> I mean, a really wonderful businessman.<br> - And he has a wonderful job.|- Doing what?<br> Oh, I don't know, Pops.|He makes something.<br> Does it really matter what it is?<br> He's the kind of a person that can do|anything, anything at all. He's... He's...<br> ...absolutely, terribly, wonderful.<br> Stanley, you've hurt her.<br> While she was talking,|all I could think of was a little girl...<br> ...in brown pigtails and dirty overalls, flying|at the boys when they pushed her too far.<br> Seems like such|an incredibly short time ago.<br> Go speak to her.|I'm afraid she's crying.<br> Kay...<br> And as for his parents,|I'll tell you this right now, Pops...<br> ...they're just as good as you and Moms.<br> They're fine people,|and they live in Westbridge.<br> I guess you'll agree that Westbridge|is as good a place as Fairview Manor.<br> Oh, I don't see what that|has to do with it anyway.<br> Okay, kitten.<br> I love him already.<br> What'd you say his last name was?<br> Oh, Pops!<br> Stanley! Come away from that window.<br> I wanna get a peek at this superman.<br> Oh, how nice. Come in.<br> Stanley!<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Banks.|- Kay'll be down in a minute.<br> She went to get her things.|Won't you come and sit down?<br> Well, I...<br> Stanley?<br> Stanley!<br> Darling, you remember Mr...<br> I can't call you Mr. anything.<br> - You won't mind if I call you Buckley?|- Oh, please do.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> How are you?<br> Fine.<br> - And you?|- Fine.<br> Kay's been telling us|some exciting news.<br> - I hope you don't mind.|- Oh, no.<br> We're delighted. Aren't we?<br> It's wonderful, so exciting,|having a romance right under our...<br> That is, well, you might say,|right in our midst.<br> Isn't it, Stanley?<br> Stanley?<br> Oh, yes.<br> I'm afraid it was a little sudden...<br> ...but I couldn't...<br> - Hello there.|- Hello.<br> - Was I too early?|- Oh, no.<br> - Better put on your heavy coat.|- Oh, Pops, I'd die in that heavy coat.<br> - I'd smother to death.|- Just the same, I'd wear it.<br> Don't fuss.|I'll be perfectly all right.<br> I think you'd better take it.<br> - You do?|- Yes.<br> Okay.<br> Right then I realized that my day was over.<br> She'll always love us, of course,|but not in the old way.<br> From here on, her love will be doled out like|a farmer's wife tossing scraps to a rooster.<br> - Good night.|- Good night.<br> Good night, Pops.|Don't wait up, we'll be late.<br> - Good night.|- Good night.<br> I don't like him.<br> Oh, darling, I know he isn't good enough|for Kay, but then no one is or ever will be.<br> - At least he's better than her other beaus.|- That's a great recommendation.<br> - She's old enough to know her own mind.|- That child?<br> You didn't mind that|I was 18 when I married you.<br> - Well, that's...|- That's different.<br> Oh, she'll make a beautiful bride.<br> She has just the coloring and figure.<br> I know the dress she should wear!|It was in last month's Vogue.<br> I couldn't believe it.|Ellie was as happy as a lark.<br> She wasn't worrying about Buckley.|Her mind was on the wedding.<br> Some make you look ghastly,|but this was perfect. I'll find it.<br> It had just a touch of eggshell pink.<br> What's the matter, darling?|Can't you sleep?<br> - No.|- You want some hot milk?<br> - No.|- Well, then, good night.<br> Boy, you're wonderful.<br> Thank you, darling.<br> If Kay was out at a dance, you wouldn't|close your eyes until you heard her come in.<br> When it's a question of whether she'll|eat for the rest of her life, you sleep.<br> Eat? You want something to eat?<br> I am talking about Kay, Ellie. Kay.<br> She sits there tonight and says,|I'm marrying Buckley. Isn't he cute?<br> And we all dance and make faces.<br> What do we know about him?<br> If you're gonna sit up, put on your robe.<br> We don't know a thing about him.|Not a darn thing!<br> Don't know where he comes from,|or what he makes.<br> We only know his name,|and you weren't sure about that.<br> And yet he walks in|and we hand him Kay.<br> You only have to look at him to know he's|nice and that he comes from a nice family.<br> The way he calls you sir|and holds my chair for me...<br> That reminds me. I must call his family|tomorrow and tell them how happy we are.<br> Is that all you need, that he holds your|chair for you and he says sir to me?<br> Is that all you want?|Well, it isn't all I want!<br> I want to know if he'll make her happy. If he|can make a home for her and support her.<br> You heard his ideas on marriage.|He thinks the family should support them.<br> And you know which family|he means, don't you, honey?<br> He means us. Sure, sure.<br> He figures on moving in with us.<br> Then when the food gets bad,|why, he'll dump the kids on us and skip.<br> Probably done it before.|Probably got another wife.<br> Read about it all the time.|Fellas have wives in three or four places.<br> Maybe he's got a criminal record!<br> Fella might be a counterfeiter|or confidence man or...<br> Those are the ones.<br> Those smooth-talking ones|that have the manners.<br> Manners are their stock and trade.<br> Yeah, those soft-spoken fellas who look|you right in the eye and would put a bullet...<br> ...in her neck and never turn a hair!<br> You mark my words,|this is going to end in tragedy.<br> But, Stanley, I...<br> Well, I got it off my chest.<br> Funny, the minute you get someone else|worrying, you stop worrying yourself.<br> Come in!<br> Well, you're an early bird.<br> How you could sleep, I don't know.|I couldn't close my eyes.<br> I was so upset about Kay.<br> Kay? What's Kay done now?<br> Oh, I kept thinking about what you said.|Suppose he is a good-for-nothing?<br> Suppose he doesn't mean|to make a home for her?<br> Now, stop worrying, Ellie.<br> You've got to talk with him|before this goes any farther.<br> You've got to come right out and ask him|about what he has and everything.<br> Oh, darling, I can't do that.|I can't walk up and say:<br> - How's your bank balance, kid?|- Why not? You're her father.<br> I know, but even a father...<br> Stanley...<br> I believe you're afraid of him.<br> Well, that's a fine remark, I must say.<br> Stanley, Kay's up. Now, you tell her you|want to see this boy and right away.<br> Finished?<br> - Hi, Pops.|- Hi.<br> - How are you?|- Fine.<br> Kay?<br> About Buckley...<br> What about him?<br> Oh, I think he's great.|Fine chap. Nice, clean-cut chap.<br> - Thanks.|- Yeah.<br> I thought, you know, we might|have a little talk, you know.<br> About what he's earning,|you know...<br> - You're kidding.|- That sort of thing. L...<br> I didn't believe they really did that.|I thought it was just a gag.<br> After all, when a man's|only daughter is getting married...<br> If you want to go through that|old-fashioned rigamarole, it's okay with me.<br> When do you want to see him?<br> Well, what about tonight?<br> We have a date at 9.<br> Why don't you ask him to dinner?|We can talk before dinner. About 6:30?<br> Okay. I'll deliver him.<br> Kay, Kay! You know, don't...|Tell him we're gonna chat.<br> Don't make it sound formidable.<br> - I don't want to frighten the boy to death.|- Oh, don't worry about Buckley.<br> He's big enough to take it.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> - Good evening.|- Good evening, Mrs. Banks.<br> It's Delilah's night out,|and Kay and I are cooking dinner.<br> - We might put you to work. I have an apron...|- Not now.<br> - Let him get his talk with Pops over.|- Talk?<br> - You're going to have a talk?|- Yes. A talk.<br> - Where's Pop?|- He's in the living room, I think.<br> - Here he is, Pops.|- Oh! Oh, hello.

Miss it?<br> Don't you think I wanted a wedding|with all the trimmings?<br> Why didn't you have it?<br> Because you didn't want it,|so I pretended I didn't either.<br> And you've been brooding about it|all this time?<br> No, of course not,|but I have thought about it.<br> Buy yourself a wedding dress|and I'll marry you all over again.<br> No, I'll be satisfied|to see Kay in one.<br> Stanley, I don't know how to explain,|but a wedding, a church wedding...<br> ...well, it's what every girl dreams of.<br> A bridal dress,|orange blossoms, the music...<br> ...it's something lovely for her|to remember all her life.<br> And something for us|to remember too.<br> From then on, I was a dead duck.<br> - You should've seen it.|- I did! I saw it from the back.<br> - The look on the poor...|- Hi, Pop!<br> I'm sorry we're late getting home,|but we had a busy day.<br> Just wait until you see these.|Delilah?<br> - Did a dress come for me today?|- There are six or seven packages upstairs.<br> - Pops, wait until you see this one.|- These slippers were such a bargain.<br> Yes.

The bag is here.|Here's the bag.<br> Isn't that lovely? That's what|the bridesmaids are going to wear.<br> Aren't you afraid of the cops?<br> It should give the idea of spring,|of wood nymphs in glades.<br> Like the girl on the White Rock bottle.<br> Here's the thing.<br> - Kay? Kay!|- Two...<br> - Hi! Where is she?|- She's upstairs.<br> - Kay, what did you get today?|- Come up.

It's her trousseau.<br> - Is she gonna get all that?|- Of course.<br> - Her closets are bulging.|- She can't wear those old things.<br> Darling, do you know what trousseau|means? It's from the French.<br> It means a little bundle that the bride|carries under her arm to her new home.<br> How sweet.|I've got good news for you.<br> - The church is free.|- Well, I'm glad something's free.<br> I mean, it's available|on the 10 of June.<br> - You mean we pay for the church?|- There were some telephone messages.<br> A man called about flowers|for the church and reception.<br> Mrs. Givens left her dressmaker's name.|The candid cameraman...<br> - The candid cameraman?|- Thanks.

Come.<br> Turn around.<br> It fits perfectly.|I've got to get yours out of the attic.<br> Like it, Pop?<br> Are you getting a trousseau too?<br> Didn't we tell you?|Buckley asked Ben to be his best man.<br> He did, huh? $ 150! Why didn't|he pick on one of his own friends?<br> I thought it was swell of him.|Why, I hardly know the guy.<br> It's only two syllables, you know,|from bank to bankruptcy.<br> Hello?<br> A what? An orchestra?|You've got the wrong number.<br> Wait, Stanley.<br> Are you the orchestra|Mrs. Parkman recommended?<br> How many of you are there?<br> That sounds very nice.<br> The 10 of June.<br> I'll be hearing from you, then. Bye.<br> Stanley, from now on,|don't answer the phone.<br> - Orchestra? Are you out of your head?|- For the reception.<br> We have to have music,|and it only costs $85.<br> Only $85? Only $85.<br> What will people say|when I'm in the gutter...<br> ...because I tried to put on a wedding|like a Roman emperor?<br> While my secretary went over the list|of wedding guests, I went over the bills.<br> Before I order the invitations, you ought to|know how many people Mrs. Banks is asking.<br> A hundred?<br> Five hundred and seventy-two.<br> Five hundred and seventy-two?|There must be some mistake.<br> Mrs. Banks doesn't mean|to ask them all to the reception.<br> Only 280 of them. The rest|just get asked to the church.<br> Only 280 come to the house, huh?<br> The house won't hold 280 people.<br> I was talking to our accountant.|He's married off four daughters.<br> He breaks his wedding guests down|into units: Reception units and church units.<br> Each reception unit includes|the cost of champagne...<br> ...caterers, tips, flowers,|extra insurance...<br> - Insurance?|- Breakage and fire.<br> Cigarette burns and that sort of thing.<br> Broken down that way, he said the cost|of each reception unit comes to $3.75.<br> A couple?<br> A head.<br> $3.75 a head?<br> Thank you, Miss Bellamy.<br> And good night.<br> $3.75 a head.<br> There are gonna be 150 people...<br> ...invited to this house to the|reception, and not one more.<br> I don't care how many you invite|to the church. Pack them in.<br> But the 151 st person who comes into this|house is gonna be thrown out on his neck.<br> They're not my friends.|I wanted a small wedding.<br> There are people you just can't ask|to the church. They'd be insulted.<br> No longer a question of insulting people.|This is a question of survival.<br> Put an X next to the names of people we|have to absolutely invite to the reception.<br> We throw the rest out.|Let's get to work.<br> I can't be any help. I've already|cut my list absolutely to the bone.<br> Here's someone. The Sandways.|We never see them anyway.<br> As for the woman with the dyed hair,|I don't care to ever see her.<br> Harry Sandway happens to be one|of the best friends I have in the world.<br> Besides being one|of my very best clients.<br> Pops, a client.<br> Harry Sandway would go to the ends|of the earth for me, and I for Harry.<br> What about cutting down a little bit|on this garden club of yours?<br> We could get along without them.<br> We have to ask them.|They're running me for president.<br> I thought a wedding was supposed|to be a joyous occasion.<br> This is a business convention.<br> - What's the matter with her?|- She's nervous.<br> All women are nervous.<br> Yes, come in.<br> I'm sorry about the way I acted.<br> That's all right.|I guess it was my fault.<br> We're all a little unstrung|by this wedding business.<br> All this fuss and worry.<br> I never wanted anything like this.|I wanted a small wedding.<br> That's what we all wanted,|but it kind of got out of hand.<br> All this money. I feel horribly.<br> - You know, kitten, I had an idea.|- What is it?<br> I don't know if it's any good or not,|but I thought that...<br> Well, I was wondering if I gave you|and Buckley about $ 1500...<br> ...how would you like to elope?<br> Elope?<br> Tomorrow or the next day,|you run off somewhere...<br> But, Pops, eloping?<br> Sneaking off and getting married?<br> Well, I'd feel sort of, well,|as if something were wrong.<br> As if you didn't want me|to marry Buckley.<br> Kitten, I don't think it would...<br> But to get married by the justice of peace|in some dirty little office...<br> ...with you and Moms not there?<br> I don't know, Pops, but...<br> I wouldn't feel as if|I were really getting married.<br> - Well, it's just an idea.|- Stanley!<br> Forget about it.|I'm coming, Ellie!<br> - Lf you're worried about the money...|- No!<br> Just forget all about it.|Let's forget I ever mentioned it.<br> You've got to help me|cut this thing down.<br> If we ask Bob and Betty,|we have to ask the Dicksons.<br> - Then we have to have the Warners...|- Mother, let's call the whole thing off.<br> - Let's not have the wedding.|- What?<br> - Buckley and I could elope.|- Elope?<br> I told you that I didn't want you|to talk about that eloping nonsense.<br> Now stop it. Stop it.<br> She's afraid I'm spending|too much money.<br> Kay, you wouldn't elope.|It would break my heart.<br> - Of course she wouldn't.|- But, Pops, you...<br> I've heard all about this I care to hear.|Now stop it, stop it. Really, it's so...<br> Look, we're not gonna|cut these down at all.<br> - Invite all of them.|- Can we afford it?<br> Of course we can afford it.|What is money for...<br> ...if it isn't to give my daughter|the finest wedding that's ever been...?<br> What are you trying to do?|Get me in trouble?<br> Ellie had dug up one of those|little caterers.<br> He was willing to take the whole|reception over and take us over too.<br> Yes, that's been|a very successful cake.<br> We made that|for Brenda Santanya.<br> The daughter of the Princess Rashisi|by her second husband.<br> Yes, the princess.<br> - Delightful person, isn't she?|- Yes.<br> And this is another we made|for the Stoughton-Shutbright nuptials.<br> - Do you like that, Mrs?|- Banks.<br> I'd better get your name|and the date first.<br> Will you step over here, please?<br> Ellie, Ellie, Ellie.<br> Just for the cake.<br> Will you sit here, please?<br> - Now, then...|- Mr. And Mrs. Stanley Banks...<br> ...24 Maple Drive,|Fairview Manor.<br> And the wedding is June 10th.<br> June 10th. Very good.<br> - Now, about the reception...|- We're not having a very large one.<br> Small and selective.|I understand perfectly.<br> And we don't want a cake.<br> - What? You don't want a cake?|- No.<br> - Why?|- Cakes are cheap.<br> Everybody has one.|We don't want one.<br> I understand perfectly.<br> Very select weddings|no longer have them...<br> ...but for the ordinary people,|we have to show them.<br> Now...<br> ...about the food, let's see.<br> What about a large salmon|at either end of the table...<br> ...with the salads in great bowls|in the center?<br> Another very dramatic arrangement|is cold sturgeon in the middle of the table.<br> For the ices, we pride ourselves|on a very special effect.<br> With colored lights...<br> We didn't intend on having|that kind of reception.<br> What did you have in mind, madam?<br> Well, we thought we'd have some|assorted sandwiches. Different kinds.<br> And some ice cream|and little cakes.<br> You can have what you wish...<br> ...but that's what we usually serve|for children's parties.<br> Well, that's what we want.<br> This 24 Maple Drive...|Is it a club or a country estate?<br> It's our home.<br> - What attendance are you anticipating?|- About 250.<br> - Is it a large house?|- No, it's a small house.<br> Then you'll be planning|for a marquee on the terrace.<br> - This, for instance.|- We don't have a terrace.<br> If they overflow the house,|they could tramp around out on the lawn.<br> I'll tell you what I'll do.<br> I'll get our field engineer|to go over the property.<br> We always have to do that.<br> The next Saturday, I finally got around|to trying on my old cutaway.<br> Ellie!<br> - Ellie!|- Yes, dear?<br> Ellie! Look, look, look, look!<br> - What is it?|- I'm in it.<br> Well, well.<br> Not so bad, huh?<br> A little snug,|but maybe I can...<br> Maybe I could take off a pound or two|before the wedding.<br> Are you standing naturally?<br> You look as though you might've been|strapped up by a surgeon.<br> I was wondering...<br> ...do you think you ought to get|a new one? With Ben...<br> Nonsense. What are you talking about?|I've only worn this thing twice.<br> - Stanley...|- Do you realize most men...<br> ...couldn't even get into their cutaway|after 20 years?<br> If that button gives way,|it's gonna put out somebody's eye.<br> You know...<br> ...sometimes they wear them|unbuttoned.<br> I kind of like it unbuttoned,|don't you?<br> I like it better that way.<br> Just wait, just wait.|Wait till I have this thing...<br> ...let out just a little.<br> You'll be surprised.|You wait and see.<br> Stanley, I want you|to look at these.<br> Aren't they lovely?|Kay's presents to the bridesmaids.<br> You'd never dream|they cost only $ 15.<br> Fifteen dollars?<br> This is what she's giving Buckley.<br> She's giving Buck...|She's giving that to Buckley?<br> The bride always gives|the groom a present.<br> Can you arrange to meet me|in town on Saturday?<br> We have to pick out the flat silver|to get it marked.<br> - The what?|- Kay's flat table silver.<br> You know we give Kay|the flat silver and the...<br> Yes. What does Buckley's family give?|Just Buckley?<br> Just Buckley.<br> - Mom?|- Yes, dear?<br> There's a Mr. Massoula|and another guy downstairs.<br> That's the fellow with the cake.<br> - Say, come here.|- What's wrong?<br> I just happened to think, you're going|to get married pretty soon, aren't you?<br> And then it'll be my turn.<br> My turn to present you|to the father of the bride...<br> ...as my one and only contribution.<br> - I feel better, son.|- Stanley?<br> An experienced caterer can make you|ashamed of your house in 15 minutes.<br> Ellie was on the verge of tears.<br> These doors...<br> They'll have to be taken off|and stored.<br> Surprising how much circulation|you lose on account of doors.<br> Especially doors like that.<br> All I know is, you can't get|more than 125 in the house.<br> Squash them in like|a lot of bugs if you did.<br> We were planning to take|some of this furniture upstairs.<br> We were going to take up|the small chairs and tables...<br> ...and the standing lamp,|and even the rug.<br> Taking up the rug|ain't gonna give us more room.<br> Well, have you any suggestions?<br> Yes, madam, I have.<br> Even with the marquee,|you'll be cramped.<br> Joe, go out in the back|and measure for that marquee.<br> You see, madam,|circulation is your big problem.<br> The first thing to do|is clear this room of all furniture.<br> - The settee and the armchair?|- And the piano.<br> And in the dining room,|the same thing too.<br> Do you think I have a cold-storage|warehouse upstairs?<br> I have an attic that's full now.<br> I suggest you do|what our other clients do.<br> Hire a moving van to take things out,|then bring them back when it's over.<br> Now, the marquee.<br> We'll attach the marquee|to this French door.<br> I decided, after all, I might|as well get a new cutaway.<br> Every mail brought a new terror.<br> The Craftons are coming.<br> The Lewises, the Quincy-Browns|and the Gaylords.<br> Apparently Kay picked a day...<br> ...when nobody within 400 miles|has got anything to do.<br> - How nice.|- Somebody refuse?<br> The Whiteheads were asked to another|wedding and gave it up to come to ours.<br> The Whiteheads?|They live in Pittsburgh.<br> What crust! Coming all the way|from Pittsburgh.<br> Moms! Pops!|Look, I got a present!<br> A wedding present!<br> Look, a tray!|A lovely hand-painted tray! Delilah!<br> Come and see.|Look, I've got a present!<br> We were not accustomed|to such bounty.<br> The idea that anyone|should go out and purchase a gift...<br> ... with hard money filled us|with tender gratitude.<br> For a few days, it looked as if this|might be the last as well as the first...<br> ... but then they began to come in.<br> A thin trickle at first...<br> ... then more and more.<br> Given enough ointment,|there's always a fly.<br> Given enough presents,|there's bound to be a stinker.<br> - Who sent that?|- With love, from Aunt Hattie.<br> - Aunt Hattie, huh?|- Kay was expecting a nice, fat check.<br> When I think of all the guff|I've taken from that...<br> - What are we gonna do with it?|- Really like me to tell you?<br> You could always drop it. Kay!<br> Kay, come take a look|at what Aunt Hattie sent you.<br> You can send it back.<br> Darling, no one would take that back|once they got rid of it.<br> You can send them all back.<br> The wedding's off.<br> Kay, what are you saying?<br> Just that.<br> I'm not going to marry Buckley.<br> I found out something|about him that's...<br> ...unforgivable.<br> - What could've happened?|- I don't know.<br> Ellie.<br> Let me go.<br> Kitten?<br> Please, Pops.|It's no use talking.<br> I won't talk. I wanna tell you|everything's all right.<br> Whatever you choose to do,|it's okay with us.<br> Thank you, Pops.<br> You know...<br> You always used to talk|about taking a little trip to Europe.<br> Why don't I fix that up tomorrow?<br> You could take a friend with you.<br> Pops, I couldn't.<br> Not after all you've been through.<br> All this horrible expense and everything.<br> Heavens! That doesn't matter.<br> Nothing matters except your happiness.<br> We can arrange everything,|make some excuse.<br> Say that you're ill or something.<br> We'll send back the presents,|notify the people that are coming.<br> Oh, don't.<br> He should've told me before!<br> He shouldn't have kept it from me.<br> To have this thing|come out of the blue tonight.<br> There, there, there.|Don't, don't.<br> Nova Scotia for a honeymoon?<br> A camp in Nova Scotia!<br> So he could fish for some horrible|salmon or something.<br> He knew I bought millions|of evening clothes and things.<br> That didn't matter to him.<br> Oh, no.<br> He loves to go fishing,|so he decides we're going fishing.<br> Well, after all...<br> What do you mean?<br> Well, I mean, I thought it was|something even worse than that.<br> Maybe like another girl|or something.<br> A girl wouldn't be so bad.<br> At least you could|get your teeth in a girl.<br> But this is our whole lives,|our whole future.<br> If he's just this selfish now, so mean|when it's a question of our honeymoon...<br> ...what's he gonna be like|after we're married?<br> - Had you talked it over?|- Of course we had.<br> I told him I wanted|to go someplace romantic...<br> ...but he said there was nothing|as romantic...<br> ...as a fishing shack in Nova Scotia.<br> We had a horrible fight.<br> I said terrible things to him.<br> And he called me a spoiled brat!<br> I made him stop the car,|and I jumped out and left him right there.<br> Buckley's here.<br> Poor boy's stricken. He looks terrible.<br> I never saw anyone who was suffering so.<br> He'll get over it.<br> - Good evening.|- She won't see you, Buckley.<br> - Lf I could speak to her...|- It's no use.<br> Will you tell her I'm sorry,|she's right about everything?<br> I was selfish and pigheaded.<br> I didn't realize. I should've asked her.|I'll go anywhere. I'll do anything.<br> Tell her I'm sorry. I want|to take back what I said.<br> - Will you tell her that, please?|- Yes, I'll tell her.<br> - Go home and pull yourself together.|- Thank you.<br> - What did you do to your hand?|- Nothing, nothing!<br> Kay slammed the car door on it.<br> - Good heavens! Let's get some...|- Buckley!<br> Buckley!<br> Oh, darling! Darling!<br> - I'm sorry. Forgive me.|- It was my fault. Forgive me.<br> - It wasn't your fault.|- I was selfish, pigheaded and stupid.<br> - I'm sorry!|- It's all right.<br> - I was a spoiled brat.|- We'll go anywhere you want.<br> - Does your hand hurt? I'm sorry!|- No, no.<br> It doesn't matter just as long|as we're together.<br> - I'm sorry, darling! It was all my fault.|- Don't worry. We'll be together forever.<br> It's all right. It's all right...<br> By the wedding rehearsal...<br> ... everyone but me seemed|to have lost interest.<br> And to make it even worse,|it was raining cats and dogs.<br> You take the bride's one. You're the one|who knows the Banks family...<br> ...and where to put this.<br> Now, the usher for the groom|is Edward owens. Edward owens.<br> He couldn't come tonight,|but I'll see him tomorrow.<br> - He couldn't come tonight?|- No.<br> Great. Now, boys and girls, now listen.<br> Now, I'm sure that you want this|to come off perfect in every detail...<br> God bless you, darling.|Just as I do.<br> We're going to just stick here tonight until|we get it right, even if it takes all night.<br> - Kay, it's about time. It's...|- I'm sorry.<br> Where's Buckley?<br> I talked to him on the phone.|He'll try to be here soon as he can.<br> - He'll try to be here?|- Let's start rehearsing.<br> - We can't! The bridegroom isn't here.|- Good evening.<br> Half of the wedding party isn't here.<br> Half the wedding party never is here.<br> Rev. Galsworthy isn't here.|We can't go on without him.<br> It doesn't matter. I take the rehearsal.|It will be all right.<br> - Come on.|- You shouldn't be sitting here.<br> Shouldn't you be up front there?|Why don't you go?<br> Come on now. Let's get going.<br> Pop, the bride never rehearses.|It's bad luck.<br> Ben, there's no reason why you shouldn't|rehearse. Come on. Get up front.<br> - Who's this?|- He belongs up at the altar.<br> - Yes, of course.|- Come on, get up there.<br> B girl, B girl, get back there. Get back.|Move up front. That's right.<br> You come over here and you there.|There, that's right.<br> Now, then. Now, then.|Now, we want a bride.<br> You'll do. You come over here.|Take Mr. Banks' arm.<br> - Then you have to...|- We won't need that.<br> No, no, it'll be fine tomorrow, I'm sure.<br> As we get... Right back, please, Mr. Banks.|There we are. And back. That's right.<br> That's fine. You stay there.<br> As to... Pardon me. As to the simple step|that you have to do...<br> It's perfectly easy.|You'll all get the hang of it.<br> Now, just watch me now.|Girls, watch me very carefully.<br> Step, stop, and step, stop.<br> Step, stop. That's all it is. That's all|there is to it. It's perfectly easy.<br> Boys, when I give you the word go,|start with the right foot. Fritz?<br> Fritz!<br> Now, then, right... oh, no! You don't|hesitate. No, just an ordinary walk.<br> Just a dignified walk up the aisle.|Go on, get a move on.<br> That's right. That's good.|You're next in line here.<br> Another boy with you. Come on, girls.|We're not ready to go. Listen to the music.<br> No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Right foot.<br> - Are you by yourself?|- No.<br> No, come on. Come on, girls, here.|There you are. Come on, get a move on.<br> Now, the bride and the father.<br> Now, the right foot, Mr. Banks.|The right foot. Here we go.<br> Never mind that. Right foot,|Mr. Banks. Right foot.<br> No, the right foot first. Please, it's|quite simple. It is, really, Mr. Banks.<br> Good heavens!|What are you doing?<br> - I'm the best man.|- The best man is up here by the altar.<br> Boys and girls, each side of the aisle.<br> No, boys on that side. The girls...|Yes, bridesmaids there. That's right.<br> Come on, over here.|The boys on the right.<br> There you are. That's right, here.<br> You really must practice|at home, Mr. Banks.<br> There we are. That's right.|You stay there.<br> Now, so and so and so and so and so.|Then who giveth, and then I do.<br> Then you go back and join Mrs. Banks.|No, you don't turn! You back gracefully.<br> Very slow. It doesn't matter|which foot first. Then you slide.<br> When the ceremony's over, the bridegroom|takes the bride down the aisle.<br> Bye, Pops.<br> I'll be the bridegroom.<br> Where are you going, Kay?<br> Then the boys... You take the ladies,|and down you... No, she's gone now.<br> She'll be here tomorrow.|Each bridesmaid takes an usher...<br> ...and away you go down... That's right.|You've got it? Yes, you've got it.<br> Splendid, splendid.<br> Yes, you be here tomorrow.<br> Let's get down to brass tacks|and have a real rehearsal.<br> - I thought it was fine.|- Fine? That was a rat race!<br> - That wasn't a wedding procession...|- If you'd like to do it again, of course...<br> All through, I see. That means|that I'm just in time.<br> I'm so sorry. I had a meeting.|But Tringle here is an old hand.<br> - They know their stuff?|- Yes.<br> Good, good, good, good.<br> I'm sure everything will go smoothly|and be a beautiful wedding.<br> - And now I have a meeting.|- Just a moment, Rev. Galsworthy.<br> We haven't had a rehearsal.|You see, the groom isn't here.<br> The groom isn't very important,|is he, my dear?<br> You're not nervous? She's not nervous.<br> Have your young man call me|in the morning.<br> That's all right.<br> And now I must run.|I hate to, but I must.<br> Don't worry. Everything will go|beautifully tomorrow.<br> I know. I've done it before.<br> Good luck. Such a beautiful bride.<br> I'm sure you'll be very happy.|Goodbye!<br> Chaos!<br> Don't worry. You'll have Kay with you.<br> She's been a bridesmaid so many times|she could walk up blindfolded.<br> Absolute, complete chaos.<br> When I finally got to sleep that night,|I dreamed of the wedding.<br> I was late.<br> Somehow I couldn't seem|to move my feet.<br> Hi, Pops.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Couldn't sleep. What are you doing?<br> I was hungry.<br> Pops, I know I'm a fool...<br> ...but if I tell you something,|you won't think I'm silly, will you?<br> Why, of course not, kitten.|What's bothering you?<br> I'm scared, Pops, scared to death.<br> Why, what are you scared of?|There's nothing to be scared of.<br> - Marriage is the most normal...|- I know, Pops. I'm not scared of marriage.<br> It's much sillier than that.<br> See, it's this way.<br> You know how I wanted a simple wedding,|out in the country somewhere?<br> Well, that's out. We don't live|in the country, period.<br> But this thing's gotten bigger|and bigger and bigger.<br> I know it's ungrateful of me...<br> ...but sometimes it scares|the living daylights out of me.<br> You mean, walking down the aisle?<br> Yeah. Every time I think about it...<br> ...I break into a cold sweat.<br> Suppose my knees got shaking|just as I started?<br> Suppose they shook until finally|they let me down entirely?<br> You had to drag me down the aisle|like a sack of meal.<br> Well, we could always take a short snort|just before the show begins.<br> Oh, Pops!<br> Now, look, kitten, get this into your head.<br> There is nothing to worry about,|not a thing.<br> Whenever you've been bothered,|I've always been around.<br> Well, I'll be around when|that wedding march starts too.<br> All you have to do is take my arm...<br> ...and lean against me and relax.<br> I'll do the rest.<br> You are wonderful.<br> Nothing ever fazes you, does it?<br> The day of the wedding dawned at last.<br> - Haven't you got this stuff out?|- I didn't know you were in a hurry.<br> - We were just relaxing!|- The quicker you get it out, the better.<br> No flowers! No flowers!|Take them out of here!<br> - Hold it, hold it!|- Hey, this stuff's gotta go.<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Aunt Hattie!<br> Well, Aunt Hattie. Yes, this is the day,|Aunt Hattie.<br> Sorry you couldn't make it.<br> What? You're here!<br> Well, just a minute, Aunt Hattie.<br> Where are you, Aunt Hattie? Where?<br> At the depot.<br> Ben, Ben, Ben! Thank you.<br> Aunt Hattie's at the depot.|Go and get her.<br> I can't. I gotta get Buckley's things|and bring them here...<br> Your domestic staff was to stay|out of the kitchen.<br> My domestic staff is getting me|a bicarbonate of soda.<br> Take a choice. Wedding banquet or|bicarbonate of soda. You can't have both!<br> Aunt Hattie. Hello? Hello, Aunt Hattie.<br> - Lf you'll wait outside the station...|- Where's Kay?<br> - I gotta see her right away.|- Upstairs.<br> Somebody will pick you up.<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Tommy, Tommy!<br> - Aunt Hattie is at the station...|- Forget it.<br> I can't, because I gotta borrow|a white shirt.<br> Hello, Joe!<br> What are you trying to do? Trip me?<br> I'm sorry. Sorry. Joe? Take|the pikeway and turn off at the ramp.<br> Yeah, follow Durand for two miles...<br> Look where you're going!<br> - Do you want this stuff moved?|- Yeah.<br> - Tell this guy to keep his pots out!|- Ask at any gas station.<br> I'll tell you as much...<br> Why don't you wait with your pots and...?<br> Let all these ferns wilt in that sun?|You know how much these cost?<br> You're not buying it. You're renting it.<br> How do you like the nerve of this guy?|There's your boss. He's my boss too!<br> Gangway!<br> Gangway!<br> By 3:00, I was dressed.<br> I took the precaution of wearing|a belt and suspenders.<br> Ellie.<br> Ellie, do you know what time it is? Quarter|past 4. We should be there now.<br> Hurry up!<br> Where is this automobile?<br> Well, I'll be...|This is...<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Operator, will you get me|Jake's Garage, please?<br> Well... Well, keep on trying, will you?<br> Please keep...<br> We've got a wedding and no way|to get to the church. No cars!<br> Will you do that? Thanks very much.<br> Don't worry, darling.<br> If there's one thing we know,|they can't start without us.<br> I knew I'd never be able to remember|what Ellie wore that day.<br> But I also knew I'd never forget|the way she looked...<br> ... with the beauty of her own|wedding day on her.<br> Ellie.<br> - Ellie, you look...|- Thank you, darling.<br> You don't have to say another word.<br> You have no right to look like this,|you know. It isn't fair to the bride.<br> Hello? Hello, is this Jake's Garage?<br> Holy smoke, Aunt Hattie, where are you?<br> The cars are here. Never mind.|Kay! Delilah! The cars are here!<br> Aunt Hattie's been down at the station.|Wants to know how to get to the church.<br> - We'll take the first car. Follow with Kay.|- Ellie! Ellie!<br> - What am I gonna tell her?|- Tell her to jump in a lake.<br> Go outside the station. There's a lake...<br> There's some taxis there. Take one|and go to the church. I'll pay for it.<br> All right, Aunt Hattie. All right.<br> Kay! Kay, do you know what time it is?<br> Kay! Kay, Kay, it's 4:20!<br> I'm ready. Come in.<br> She looked like the princess|in a fairy tale.<br> I wouldn't have been surprised if she'd|held out her hand for me to kiss.<br> You're wonderful, kitten, just wonderful.<br> Thanks, Pops.<br> Well, on to the slaughter.<br> Yeah, yeah, I guess this is it, isn't it?<br> - All right, all right.|- Thank you.<br> Take this. Take your bouquet.<br> Thanks! Thanks, goodbye!<br> - Hello, I'm Duffy, the candid cameraman.|- You destroy that thing.<br> - Here they are.|- Kay!<br> Just beautiful!<br> It's beautiful, Kay.<br> Mrs. Banks, it's time.<br> Coming. Delilah.<br> Good luck, Kay.<br> Ushers! Ushers, fall in, please.<br> Now remember, right foot forward. Go!<br> Bridesmaids, bridesmaids, come, come!<br> Take your place.|Now, this is the wedding march.<br> Get ready.<br> Right, stop. Left, stop.<br> Well, Pops, we're off.<br> Get ready.<br> Remember, the right foot forward.|Right foot, right foot!<br> Right. Right.<br> Right.<br> Hold it, Pops.<br> Kay overwhelmed me.<br> She waited for the moment|with the calmness of a general...<br> ... watching his forces deploy into battle.<br> Buckley, on the other hand,|had the haggard look of a man...<br> ... who had just completed|a dangerous bombing mission.<br> Ready?<br> Dearly beloved, we are gathered together|here in the sight of God...<br> ...and in the face of this company,|to join together...<br> ...this man and this woman|in holy matrimony...<br> ...which is an honorable estate,|instituted of God, signifying unto us...<br> ...the mystical union that is betwixt|Christ and his Church.<br> All I could think of|was the part I had to play.<br> I knew I had a cue coming.<br> When the Rev. Galsworthy asked,|Who giveth this woman?...<br> ... I had to say, I do.<br> It was my only line,|and I wanted to get it right.<br> Then I was supposed to drop back a step,|turn and join Ellie in the front pew.<br> I couldn't remember what|was immediately in my rear.<br> I began to explore.<br> I didn't want to trip or fall.<br> People are so quick to attribute|such things to alcohol.<br> While I was still exploring,|it was on me.<br> Who giveth this woman|to be married to this man?<br> I do.<br> Who giveth this woman?<br> This woman.<br> But she's not a woman. She's still a child.<br> And she's leaving us.<br> What will it be like to come home|and not find her?<br> Not to hear her voice calling,|Hi, Pops, as I come in.<br> I suddenly realized what I was doing.|I was giving up Kay.<br> Something inside me began to hurt.<br> - I, Buckley Dunstan...|- I, Buckley Dunstan...<br> ...take thee, Kathryn Banks...|... take thee, Kathryn Banks...<br> ...to my wedded wife...|... to my wedded wife...<br> ...to have and to hold...|... to have and to hold...<br> ...from this day forward.|... from this day forward.<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> - In the name of the Father...|- In the name of the Father...<br> ...and of the Son...|... and of the Son...<br> ...and of the Holy Ghost.|... and of the Holy Ghost.<br> - Amen.|- Amen.<br> For as much as Buckley Dunstan|and Kathryn Banks...<br> ...have consented together|in holy wedlock...<br> ...I pronounce they are|man and wife...<br> ...in the name of the Father and of the Son|and of the Holy Ghost.<br> God the Father, God the Son,|God the Holy Ghost...<br> ...bless and preserve and keep you.<br> The Lord mercifully with his favor|look upon you...<br> ...and fill you with spiritual benediction|and grace...<br> ...that ye may so live together|in this life...<br> ...that in the world to come,|ye may have life everlasting.<br> Amen.<br> Now the race was on to get back|to the house and the free champagne.<br> The house was bursting at the seams.<br> Everywhere there were faces.|Most of them I'd never seen before.<br> I wondered if someone had broadcast|a general invitation by radio.<br> The temperature under the marquee was|between a Turkish bath and a greenhouse.<br> No one was listening to the orchestra.<br> Ellie could have saved that 85 bucks.<br> The caterer was having trouble.<br> Something was wrong, very wrong,|with his circulation.<br> Yes, yes!<br> Ladies, I must insist that you pass|through the doorway, please.<br> There was nothing wrong|with the waiters.<br> The moment a person tilted a glass,|they were waiting with a fresh supply.<br> Never have I seen men|more devoted to their work.<br> I was looking for Kay.|I still hadn't kissed the bride.<br> Well, you know, Mikhail's daughter|moved into the palace, and they...<br> - Where's Kay? I can't find her.|- In the garden, having their pictures taken.<br> First will you see about the champagne?<br> You'd think they were working|on a piece basis.<br> - See about it, will you?|- All right, all right.<br> - How's the champagne holding up?|- Okay, okay, mister. Don't worry.<br> - You'll get yours.|- Edith! Edith, hurry up!<br> - I got mine. I just...|- Kay's going to throw the bouquet!<br> I want to see this.<br> - Where's Pops? I don't see him.|- I haven't seen him either.<br> Can I get in?<br> Pardon me. I'm sorry.<br> Where on earth have you been?|Kay just threw her bouquet!<br> Ellie, look, please be nice to me.|For once in your life, be nice to me.<br> No, you can't go up now.|She's changing her clothes.<br> The reception had turned into a party.<br> I was skulking around the edges,|still waiting for a chance to see Kay.<br> They're going! They're going!|Come and get your confetti!<br> Get your confetti, everybody!<br> Come on, get your confetti!<br> Get it while it lasts! It's going fast!<br> She was gone. My Kay was gone.<br> And I'd been too late|to say goodbye to her.<br> When the last guest had gone...<br> ... and the last glass of champagne|had been drunk...<br> ... we surveyed the wreckage.<br> I suppose we'd better clean up and not|leave this mess for Delilah tomorrow.<br> I'll go up and change my dress.|Would you get the vacuum, darling?<br> Funny how empty a house|can suddenly get, isn't it?<br> I'm sorry you missed|saying goodbye to her.<br> It's all right.<br> I think she'll be happy with him,|and that's the important thing.<br> Sure, sure, sure.<br> Ellie, look.<br> Hello.<br> Hello, kitten!<br> Where are you?<br> New York.|Our train's leaving in a second.<br> I just couldn't leave without|saying goodbye to you.<br> I'm coming. Pops, say goodbye|again to Moms.<br> And thank her for all she did.<br> And, Pops, you've been just wonderful.<br> I love you.<br> I love you very much.<br> Goodbye, kitten.<br> Catch a lot of fish.<br> Bye-bye.<br> All right now?<br> Nothing's really changed, has it?<br> You know what they say:<br> My son's my son|until he gets him a wife...<br> ...but my daughter's my daughter|all of her life.<br> All of our life.<br>
