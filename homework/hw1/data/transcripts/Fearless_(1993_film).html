Right?<br> 'Cause I need someone<br> who's going to take it to them.<br> We're going to church.<br> I think that'll be okay.<br> You know He hurt me.<br> He hurt me forever.<br> But I still believe in Him.<br> People...<br> ...don't so much believe in God<br> as they choose not to believe in nothing.<br> Life and death...<br> ...they happen for no reason.<br> We may think that...<br> ...people are born<br> because their mothers wanted them...<br> ...or because God needed<br> another home-run hitter for the Giants.<br> We think that we die...<br> ...because we eat red meat or rob banks.<br> Though we can never be good enough...<br> ...or careful enough to live forever,<br> at least we can try.<br> But if it makes no sense, if it...<br> If life and death just happen...<br> ...then there's no reason to do anything.<br> There's no reason to love.<br> What?<br> There's no reason to love.<br> My car's across the street.<br> Let's go for a drive.<br> No. No, I can't.<br> The doctor told me I can't go nowhere.<br> You'll be safe.<br> Do you read the papers?<br> Everybody with me lives.<br> You must think I'm very stupid.<br> No. I'm not lying.<br> I can't explain it but...<br> ...you're safe with me.<br> So, what are you telling me?<br> There's no God, but there's you?<br> Come with me.<br> Carla, I promise you'll be safe.<br> This is a German car?<br> Swedish.<br> It's very sturdy?<br> It's a very safe car.<br> And I'm an excellent driver.<br> Never been in an accident.<br> Not while I've been behind the wheel,<br> anyway.<br> - And you know what?<br> - What?<br> It doesn't mean we'll survive this ride.<br> Because even if I do everything right...<br> ...even strapped into this marvelous<br> technology of reinforced doors and roof...<br> ...we could still be crushed.<br> That's reverse psychology, right?<br> No, it's the simple truth.<br> In fact you're not safe lying in your bed.<br> Remember '89? The next one could be<br> ten times worse.<br> You said I'd be safe with you.<br> You're safe.<br> We're safe because we died already.<br> Stop the car.<br> Please, just stop the car.<br> I'm not dead.<br> Let me out.<br> No, you're not. That's not what I meant.<br> Look.<br> Look at them.<br> They don't know what's it's like<br> to die in their heads.<br> We do. We passed through death.<br> That's bullshit.<br> I didn't die in my head.<br> My son died.<br> I wasn't thinking about dying.<br> I was thinking about...<br> About what?<br> About how he died?<br> Now hit him. Hit him, now!<br> Hit him. Right now!<br> Two in a row. Awesome.<br> I'll die!<br> Don't die, we'll get "game over."<br> - I died.<br> - Let me try.<br> I got to Level 3.<br> Then he died.<br> - Where's your mother?<br> - I don't know.<br> Byron's dad called.<br> He wants to bring him over later.<br> Do I have to play with him?<br> That's the weird kid your dad saved?<br> He comes here practically every day<br> and hangs around my dad.<br> Go.<br> Hi, darling.<br> I didn't know you were home.<br> - Did you meet with Dr. Perlman?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Did you talk?<br> - No.<br> He took me to meet a woman<br> whose child died in the crash.<br> I thought the idea was for the two of you<br> to sit down and talk, one-to-one.<br> I have a feeling<br> of overwhelming love for her.<br> I've never felt anything like it before.<br> Five, six, seven, eight, and...<br> ...a little run, a little run!<br> Slide here.<br> Slide, slide, slide.<br> Change your hands.<br> Go, skip.<br> Change your hands.<br> Okay, Joan, stop the music.<br> Let's rehearse the piece for the pageant.<br> But we don't have Eric.<br> - No, we don't.<br> - That's right, we don't.<br> We need a volunteer.<br> Dr. Perlman, perhaps?<br> Me?<br> I don't...<br> I don't think... No.<br> Couldn't you get someone else?<br> We need a male. Do you mind?<br> - What do I have to do?<br> - A tree.<br> Just a tree.<br> Just have to stand here. Like this.<br> Come on, Doctor. It'll be good therapy.<br> Okay, girls. Hold hands all around him.<br> Joan, some wind music.<br> Swirling around like a tornado.<br> And go in!<br> Doctor, the tree has leaves and branches.<br> Come on, up. Up with your arms.<br> Come on, up with your arms.<br> And feel the wind. Swing at the wind!<br> Come on, Doctor.<br> Well...<br> ...is that your revenge?<br> Look, it's getting worse.<br> He's more remote and distant than ever.<br> He's spending more time with the child<br> from the plane than with his own son.<br> And I hate that crazy truth-telling,<br> like a robot.<br> What does he do every day?<br> He looks at buildings.<br> Looks at buildings?<br> I don't mind that. I think...<br> ...he might be finding<br> something new for his work.<br> I want to know about this woman.<br> Why did you introduce them?<br> What were you trying to achieve?<br> No one can reach her. If she doesn't<br> get help, she'll end up in an institution.<br> Or worse.<br> And my husband?<br> He worries me.<br> Why?<br> I don't know.<br> I think he thinks he's invulnerable.<br> I've seen it with Vietnam vets.<br> The high they get<br> from overcoming their fear...<br> ...they become addicted to it.<br> I thought if I put them together...<br> They can help each other?<br> I don't know.<br> He said he felt overwhelming feeling<br> of love for her.<br> A feeling he never felt before.<br> What does that mean?<br> Is he falling in love with her?<br> Not in a rational way.<br> Love isn't rational.<br> It's not love.<br> He wants to save her.<br> Save her?<br> And who's saving Max?<br> Or me, for that matter?<br> Are you playing God?<br> Are you playing matchmaker?<br> What are you trying to achieve,<br> Dr. Perlman?<br> Trying to help, that's all.<br> I don't have all the answers.<br> Can't wait to see what you're working on.<br> I'm going to bed now.<br> Would you turn that down?<br> - I haven't taken one in six days.<br> - Didn't I tell you?<br> I feel great. Thanks.<br> He chickened out<br> half a mile from the airport.<br> Good to see you.<br> It's great that you came.<br> Everybody, we're going to go downstairs.<br> You come with me, Carla.<br> Everybody downstairs.<br> Come on.<br> You wait here, Manny.<br> It's okay. It's all right.<br> I'll be upstairs.<br> We used to live in tribes.<br> And when a tribe suffered a disaster...<br> ...an exploding mountain,<br> a shaking of the earth...<br> ...a great flood...<br> ...we would sit around fires...<br> ...and we'd tell the event.<br> The stories of death...<br> ...destruction...<br> ...escape and rescue.<br> That's... why we're here today.<br> Would someone...<br> ...tell us their story?<br> Yes, please.<br> I lost my sister...<br> ...and my two nephews.<br> Their seats were ripped away...<br> ...right in front of my eyes.<br> I could almost reach out...<br> It's all right.<br> Let her stay on her own.<br> This'll take forever.<br> I have to go back to the office.<br> What's your name?<br> John Wilkenson.<br> - Why were you on the plane?<br> - I was going to Houston on business.<br> You must be very committed to your work.<br> Go ahead and finish your story, please.<br> We were taking a vacation, my sister...<br> ...me and our kids.<br> You know, no husbands.<br> We saw all the dumb tourist sights<br> together, like when we were girls.<br> Only this time, we were also mommies.<br> And now we'll never be together again.<br> Let's just talk about the day of the crash.<br> What happened when the plane hit?<br> I don't know.<br> I guess I closed my eyes.<br> There was incredible noise...<br> ...and I couldn't see.<br> I was choking on the smoke.<br> I didn't think that we had long to live.<br> And then that man...<br> Is he here?<br> Are you here, Max Klein?<br> He couldn't come.<br> He saved my life.<br> How?<br> We couldn't see anything<br> and it was all smoke.<br> We couldn't even breathe<br> and I heard the sound of his voice.<br> He was shouting:<br> "Follow me! This way!"<br> I had hold of my kids<br> and I just followed his voice.<br> He sounded so normal.<br> "Follow me to the light!"<br> I was scared...<br> ...but I saw him jump...<br> ...and call out:<br> "We're alive!"<br> So I followed and...<br> ...then we were in the corn field.<br> Safe.<br> I would have gone the wrong way.<br> I came here today hoping to thank him.<br> The same thing happened to me.<br> I followed him too.<br> Excuse me, are you leaving us?<br> I don't belong here.<br> I wasn't on the plane.<br> Who are you?<br> My son died in the crash. I'm sorry.<br> No, it's okay. It's all right.<br> Why did you come?<br> I don't know.<br> I wanted...<br> ...if anyone had seen my son...<br> ...or knew how...<br> - What was his name?<br> - Where was he sitting?<br> They said he was in 21C.<br> That was right behind me.<br> Did he have red hair?<br> Yes. Kind of reddish brown.<br> - Tall man?<br> - Six feet.<br> And a moustache?<br> Yes.<br> You mean me.<br> Remember? We talked at the hospital.<br> We were on the other side of the plane.<br> Sorry.<br> Since it happened, I get confused.<br> Anyone else remember that row?<br> They were smashed flat.<br> Can anyone else help?<br> Go ahead, say something.<br> - Anyone else have information?<br> - Stop it.<br> Just let her go.<br> Why?<br> This isn't doing anybody any good.<br> She only wants to know what happened.<br> My son died.<br> Yes, but you know how he died.<br> You were with him.<br> When was the last time you saw your son?<br> His birthday, about a month before.<br> I don't remember kissing him good-bye.<br> I know I did, but I just can't remember.<br> You're very young.<br> I'm not young.<br> How old was your boy?<br> He was almost two.<br> I'm sorry.<br> He wasn't with you very long.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> This is sadistic.<br> And we're not accomplishing anything!<br> Do you remember me?<br> I'm Lisa. The flight attendant.<br> I really wanted to see you.<br> I came here mostly to see you.<br> I think about you and your baby a lot.<br> Do you remember how I tried to help you<br> with the seat belt?<br> Help me?<br> You told me everything would be okay.<br> You think you helped me?<br> Well, I tried.<br> Tried!<br> You told me to hold him. I couldn't.<br> You told me everything would be okay.<br> It wasn't!<br> Please, don't say that.<br> I didn't...<br> I didn't know!<br> You didn't know what?<br> Please.<br> You told me to hold him.<br> - You knew I couldn't!<br> - It's not my fault!<br> We're not here to blame each other.<br> You said everything would be okay...<br> ...and it wasn't!<br> He died!<br> You want everybody to talk.<br> But only if it's nice things.<br> No, that's not true.<br> My son died!<br> And blaming her won't bring<br> your baby back.<br> Of course they think it's fair.<br> So what? What do you think?<br> I'm being fucked.<br> The big law firms are getting<br> much more for their clients.<br> I'll get another lawyer.<br> Mr. Brillstein, I heard a woman got<br> $2 million for her dead baby.<br> I think I should get at least that.<br> I'll call you. I'll call you every day.<br> Good-bye.<br> You have to understand...<br> ...they owe us. They kill them<br> and they have to pay.<br> You don't understand a fucking thing!<br> I understand, Manny.<br> I understand that I'm alone.<br> So, pain and suffering are compensabLe.<br> Apart from the other compensable losses<br> such as...<br> ...the $2-million Nutty Nick stores contract.<br> We didn't have a contract.<br> - Whose side are you on?<br> - Relax.<br> Don't tell me to relax. You have a husband<br> and a partnership insurance.<br> I have...<br> ...a deposition from...<br> ...Mr. Nutty Nick...<br> ...that he had every intention...<br> ...of hiring Mr. Gordon and Mr. Klein.<br> That's good enough.<br> He's lying.<br> It's nice, but he's lying.<br> All right.<br> Do me a favor.<br> Don't say that.<br> They don't have to know your opinion,<br> okay?<br> Work with me on this, Mr. Klein.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You promised to do your best<br> for Mrs. Gordon and her children.<br> You get a third of what we get?<br> I know. I'm terrible.<br> One-third is standard, Mr. Klein.<br> It's in my interest to get<br> as large a settlement as possible.<br> In fact, that's my job.<br> I don't apologize for it.<br> No, this is America in the '90s.<br> Nobody apologizes anymore.<br> They write a memoir.<br> This is the law. Not some trick I invented.<br> Each minute that you and Mr. Gordon<br> knew that you were going to die...<br> ...is compensable as pain and suffering.<br> Testify...<br> ...to the mental anguish...<br> ...that you and Mr. Gordon experienced...<br> ...and each minute is worth dollars.<br> Big dollars. Dollars to which<br> you and Mrs. Gordon are entitled.<br> What you really want me to say...<br> ...is that Jeff wept at the prospect<br> of his wife widowed and kids orphaned.<br> It's a shame he died instantly.<br> If only he'd been mashed up and died...<br> ...slowly in my arms, Nan...<br> Jesus, Max!<br> ...could make out on this.<br> Fine. Good night.<br> Are you ashamed of me?<br> I'm trying to get money, so I don't meet<br> your standards of widowhood?<br> Let me ask you something.<br> If Jeff was here, what would he do?<br> Come on, Max, tell me.<br> I can't lie.<br> If you died and he had lived, what would<br> he say to help Laura and Jonah?<br> I know he ripped you off for the tickets.<br> Maybe!<br> Maybe he'd pay him back.<br> Are you punishing Jeff?<br> I'll say what you want.<br> Let it go.<br> I can Let it go.<br> I can't live as a coward.<br> Oh, fuck.<br> So I argued that it wasn't fair to us<br> and he agreed.<br> He just said, "Life is unfair."<br> So now the test's next week<br> and it's on Europe, not Central America.<br> I think he proved his own point.<br> Yeah, that's what I thought.<br> What'd you do today, Dad?<br> Go ahead.<br> Tell him.<br> What? What'd you do?<br> Talk to me.<br> Tell me what's going on.<br> Talk to me!<br> Each day you have to jump off a roof<br> or stand before a train to lose your fear?<br> Is that it?<br> What about me?<br> What about Jonah?<br> - You're like a crazy person.<br> - I'm not crazy.<br> I love you. We have lived together<br> for 16 years!<br> They've been great.<br> Oh, not always.<br> Yes. Always.<br> They've always been great for me.<br> Even when I hate you, I know love you.<br> I know you were happy too.<br> Remember?<br> Do you remember our marriage?<br> Even if I could remember, then what?<br> How can I live in a memory?<br> You see, that's cruel.<br> - Do you know that's cruel?<br> - That's the truth.<br> The truth?<br> You didn't tell Jonah the truth.<br> It was unfair to use him that way.<br> Fair?<br> Am I supposed to let you kill yourself?<br> I walked away from that crash alive.<br> That's what survived.<br> The taste and touch and beauty of life.<br> But I love that.<br> - I won't give that up!<br> - I don't want you to give it up!<br> Let me in.<br> Let me be part of it.<br> You can't.<br> - I wish I'd been on that plane.<br> - I'm grateful you weren't.<br> You don't make sense. You said<br> it was extraordinary, so beautiful.<br> You're right. I don't make sense<br> and I don't want to.<br> I know that what you found is...<br> ...special, whatever it is,<br> and wherever it leads you, it's thrilling.<br> But there must be a way...<br> ...to live with it so it does make sense.<br> I'm going to survive this.<br> I can't fight for you anymore. You want<br> to destroy yourself? I can't stop you.<br> I hope you make it.<br> You been dreaming a lot?<br> - You bet.<br> - Me too.<br> Were you alone on the plane?<br> No, I was with my best friend. My partner.<br> He was decapitated.<br> You saw him?<br> I should be going.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> You know, if...<br> If Manny has any interest<br> in doing carpentry full time...<br> ...I could talk to some people.<br> They'd be happy to work<br> with somebody like him.<br> Don't talk about my husband.<br> Sorry.<br> No, it's all right.<br> I'm angry with him, that's all.<br> Don't look so scared.<br> I'm not scared.<br> I'm not scared of anything.<br> Scared to kiss me.<br> I just did kiss you.<br> I mean, for real.<br> I didn't want to offend you.<br> You're right.<br> I don't want to be kissed.<br> I don't want anything.<br> But I do want to go with you<br> next time you take a drive.<br> I'm missing it.<br> Look at this show!<br> It's beautiful.<br> Kate is so serious, isn't she?<br> Oh, look!<br> Adorable!<br> Bravo!<br> Beautiful!<br> Wonderful! Wonderful!<br> Wonderful!<br> FoLks, this is the captain here.<br> We're going to make an emergency Landing<br> at BakersfieLd Airport.<br> Fasten your seatbeLts before touchdown.<br> At that time...<br> ...you'LL hear me say the words,<br> "Brace, brace, brace."<br> Hi, this is Nan. I'LL caLLyou back<br> as soon as possibLe.<br> Get into the crash positions<br> which your cabin attendants wiLL iLLustrate.<br> I'm not going to kid you,<br> it's going to be rough...<br> ...maybe worse than that.<br> Pay attention to what<br> the cabin attendants say.<br> Good Luck to us aLL.<br> - May we be excused?<br> - Bring a bag of chips.<br> Let's play computer games.<br> Let them go.<br> It's a mistake to make them<br> anything but hamburgers.<br> Next time we'll have relish and ketchup.<br> What can you do? I don't mind,<br> as long as they're happy.<br> If we'll have Thanksgiving, let's do it right.<br> Max, don't play superdad.<br> Byron, honey, no.<br> Give me this. Give me this.<br> - This is garbage.<br> - What're you doing?<br> Go back to the table and finish!<br> - Max, calm down.<br> - I'm perfectly calm.<br> Listen to me. I'm throwing this out.<br> When you die, you don't get another life.<br> - Do you understand?<br> - It's not real dying. It's pretend.<br> - I know what dead bodies look like.<br> - Shut up!<br> It's going in the garbage.<br> - He's only a little boy.<br> - Lf it was up to you, he'd stay a boy.<br> I don't care!<br> Don't be cruel.<br> I don't want him to grow up<br> a frightened child in a man's body.<br> He's just fine, Max.<br> It's you who is in trouble!<br> Now give the game back.<br> Or keep on going,<br> but right out of our lives!<br> Our son is innocent.<br> Do you want to crash our marriage?<br> Okay, but don't hurt our son.<br> I'm not scared to end our marriage.<br> Neither am I.<br> Then I'll keep on going.<br> Good.<br> - Where to?<br> - Beautiful downtown Oakland.<br> Such a shame.<br> It was going to be gentrified and rebuilt.<br> Then the recession hit.<br> The country's falling apart.<br> The United States is finished.<br> But you and me...<br> ...we're in peak condition.<br> You hungry?<br> In there?<br> Remember, we're ghosts.<br> They can't do anything to us.<br> You're really nuts. You are so crazy.<br> You should talk.<br> I can't believe you did that!<br> I'm not buying you another.<br> Look at this mess.<br> I've had it. We're going home.<br> So happy.<br> Maybe I am a ghost.<br> I was going to buy him a lot of presents.<br> Let's do it. Let's buy them.<br> What did he like?<br> How about a sword?<br> My son used to love swords.<br> He still does, but he's too old to admit it.<br> - What?<br> - What would your son like?<br> Does he play with Legos?<br> No, he's too young.<br> Bristle Blocks? Does he have those?<br> Babies can use them<br> and older kids like them.<br> You want me to buy a present for Bubble?<br> Bubble. Is that really his name?<br> It's Leonardo. I called him Bubble.<br> I can't buy him gifts. That's sick.<br> - Why?<br> - Because he's dead.<br> - Of course he's dead.<br> - You're not serious.<br> You wouldn't do this to me.<br> Would you buy a present<br> for your dead father?<br> My father?<br> I never bought him anything.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean it. I just don't think<br> it's a good idea.<br> I made him something in school.<br> Carved his name in wood.<br> Made a little nameplate<br> that you put on your desk.<br> I was 13 when he died and...<br> ...never had a chance to buy him<br> a real present.<br> Let's do it.<br> Let's buy presents for the dead.<br> Come on. Let's buy presents for the dead.<br> - I can't.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> Come on!<br> Who'll we give them to?<br> He liked to build things: Shelves, chairs.<br> He made our dining-room table.<br> Sometimes he'd give me a hammer,<br> let me do the easy stuff.<br> This is it. This is what he'd like.<br> Every time we came into a hardware store,<br> he'd stop in front of these.<br> It wasn't as magnificent as this one.<br> He'd be...<br> ...totally silent...<br> ...and then he'd say...<br> ..."I'd like to have that"...<br> ...and walk away.<br> Only thing I ever heard him say he wanted.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me!<br> I'd like to buy this for my father.<br> That's nice. I'll take care of that.<br> I've got to get him a monster.<br> He loves them.<br> I'll find him something.<br> Come here.<br> Look at this. This is great.<br> Do you mind?<br> Sorry.<br> Look what I have for us.<br> A beautiful bevy of desserts.<br> Now...<br> ...this.<br> - Don't want any.<br> - We could use it as a paperweight.<br> I want that.<br> This is the only thing you can't have.<br> Now I have several other magical...<br> I have a magic mushroom for you.<br> Or better yet...<br> ...the beautiful simplicity...<br> ...of a ripe strawberry.<br> Let's dance.<br> Come on.<br> I don't dance.<br> Come on!<br> Pick up.<br> Hold on!<br> Oh, please, please, please.<br> Good night.<br> So I'll pick you up?<br> My goodness, it's night.<br> Where are we going?<br> We could disappear.<br> You all right?<br> What's wrong?<br> What?<br> There's something I have to tell you.<br> You got to promise<br> you'll never tell anyone.<br> All right.<br> All right, calm down now.<br> What is it?<br> What?<br> I want to tell you something<br> that nobody knows.<br> Do you remember...<br> ...just when we touched ground and<br> it was like we were going to land okay?<br> What?<br> I let go of Bubble.<br> I had him in my lap.<br> I looked at the road and...<br> ...I thought we were going to be safe,<br> and the wheels bumped.<br> I opened my arms.<br> I was safe in my belt, but he wasn't.<br> Oh, I see. It was your fault?<br> It wasn't the accident?<br> - I wasn't holding him!<br> - You killed your baby?<br> And the lawyer...<br> - Brillstein?<br> ...I didn't tell him the truth.<br> I understand. So you're also a liar?<br> Yes, I lied! I lied to Father Conti.<br> I lied in the confessional.<br> I lied to the whole church!<br> - It wasn't your fault.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Carla, it's not your fault.<br> "Hail, Mary, full of grace...<br> "...the Lord is with Thee.<br> Blessed art Thou amongst women...<br> "...and blessed is the fruit<br> of Thy womb Jesus."<br> Carla, I didn't mean<br> that you killed your baby.<br> Carla, you're not to blame.<br> You couldn't have held on to your baby.<br> We were going hundreds of miles an hour!<br> Of course you think it's your fault.<br> God gave you a child.<br> It was your job to keep him safe.<br> But it's not your fault!<br> Stop it now! Come on, stop it!<br> That's enough!<br> Oh, shit.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Now what have I done?<br> Come on now.<br> I want you to get in the back.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Come on now.<br> Come on.<br> Just get in the back now.<br> This is your baby.<br> No, hold it upright, like this.<br> I know it doesn't look like a baby.<br> It looks like a toolbox.<br> It is a toolbox.<br> I want you to pretend<br> that this is your baby.<br> Pretend it's Bubble.<br> Now this is your chance to hold on tight...<br> ...to save him.<br> Hold on to Bubble!<br> As tight as you can!<br> Pray to God to give you the strength<br> to save your baby.<br> Hold on to your baby!<br> Holy Mary, Mother of God!<br> Pray for us now<br> and at the hour of our death!<br> Right behind you. Careful, please.<br> Mrs. Rodrigo, how are you doing?<br> I'm okay.<br> It's whiplash. I was with Max.<br> I know. He's in intensive care.<br> He'll be all right.<br> Just between us...<br> ...what happened?<br> He was showing me something.<br> What? That brick walls are hard?<br> How'd you get here so fast?<br> My beeper went off,<br> I was just two blocks away.<br> I don't know. I've been really lucky lately.<br> I mean, I know it's terrible...<br> ...to talk about luck<br> when you've suffered so.<br> Have you seen a doctor yet?<br> Are you okay?<br> Yes, I'm fine.<br> - What happened?<br> - Mr. Klein drove into a brick wall.<br> You don't understand.<br> The flight attendant told me<br> to hold Bubble.<br> I thought I didn't hold him tight enough.<br> I wasn't sure my hands were clasped<br> when we hit.<br> Be careful about what we're not sure of.<br> I thought I could save him.<br> Max showed me I couldn't.<br> - There was no way.<br> - He crashed the car on purpose?<br> Yes, to show me.<br> That's it.<br> That fucking nut ain't coming close to you!<br> - Let me talk to you.<br> - It's out of control.<br> Listen, our case is good. Actually,<br> we could improve our numbers here.<br> You must be Jonah.<br> I'm a friend of your daddy's.<br> Is your mom home?<br> Yeah, come in. Mom!<br> - A woman's here to see you.<br> - I know.<br> Go to your room.<br> Go to your room!<br> I'm Carla.<br> I know who you are.<br> This is a very nice house that you have.<br> Please sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sorry to bother you like this...<br> ...but I thought that it would be good<br> if we talked.<br> I called the hospital.<br> They said that Max is doing okay.<br> I don't think he's doing okay.<br> How are you?<br> I'm okay.<br> I really wasn't hurt.<br> You know, I came by because I...<br> ...I just wanted to say, you know...<br> ...I can imagine what you must be feeling...<br> ...about what has happened.<br> Really?<br> You can?<br> You have every right to be angry with me.<br> I'm not angry with you.<br> Why should I be? Wasn't it Max's idea?<br> - What he did was crazy.<br> - He must be very much in love with you...<br> ...to risk his life for you.<br> - It's not like that.<br> Isn't that love?<br> No.<br> Look, I'm sorry.<br> I didn't come to argue with you.<br> I think I better go. I'm sorry.<br> Please stay.<br> I am very sorry about your little boy.<br> Thank you.<br> You know...<br> ...when he died...<br> ...I had nothing.<br> I couldn't feel anything.<br> Now I can feel something.<br> I can feel something inside<br> besides the pain for Bubble.<br> That's because of Max.<br> He would talk to me.<br> He'd talk to me like nobody else ever has.<br> We would have these great conversations...<br> ...and they were weird,<br> but they were so exciting and...<br> It's not what you think.<br> He's my friend.<br> He's my best friend.<br> It's like God sent him to me.<br> It's like he sent me my own angel.<br> Let me be honest with you.<br> Maybe this wonderful friendship<br> that you have...<br> ...might have helped you.<br> But it hasn't helped Max.<br> Maybe our marriage is over...<br> ...but I have a son<br> and I want him to have a father.<br> Max is not an angel.<br> He's a man.<br> He cannot survive up there.<br> Hey, you.<br> How're you doing?<br> I got you these chocolates.<br> That's what they give patients.<br> Here.<br> - How's your head?<br> - Hurts!<br> I just...<br> I've really wanted to tell you how much...<br> I just wanted to say<br> how wonderful you are.<br> You look happy.<br> You know, it's probably<br> because Manny moved out.<br> I told him to.<br> Are you all right with that?<br> You know...<br> ...I visited Bubble's grave.<br> For the first time, it was okay.<br> I'm glad.<br> But you know...<br> ...things can't go back<br> to the way that they were.<br> You know what I mean?<br> I want you to go home, Max.<br> I want you to live again.<br> I'm not a ghost anymore.<br> I can't get back.<br> Yes, you can.<br> I don't want to.<br> I wish I could help you.<br> We could disappear, Carla.<br> I can't anymore.<br> I'm back.<br> I want to try living<br> on planet Earth for a while.<br> You can't save everybody, Max.<br> You got to try taking care of yourself.<br> Say good-bye, Max.<br> Good-bye? Why do we have<br> to say good-bye?<br> It has to be that way.<br> I don't want to say good-bye.<br> Just...<br> Just say it like it means nothing.<br> Good-bye, Max.<br> Please, Max.<br> Say it.<br> Good-bye, Carla.<br> "The soul comes to the end<br> of it's long journey...<br> "...and naked and alone...<br> "...draws near to the divine."<br> How're you feeling?<br> Okay.<br> Let's see.<br> Are you going to stay?<br> I don't know. We'll see.<br> Sorry about the video game.<br> It's okay. You didn't break it.<br> Good.<br> What is it?<br> I want you to save me.<br> These are for you.<br> You're here! Great.<br> Listen, it may be premature.<br> I don't want to jinx it but I think<br> I'll have it all locked up tomorrow.<br> So, champagne, assorted goodies.<br> A little celebration.<br> It's an incredible story.<br> Because of your suicide attempt,<br> don't argue that...<br> That's how I presented it, that you were<br> suffering from post-traumatic stress...<br> ...and that they were going to be<br> on the hook if you killed yourself.<br> I know, I'm terrible.<br> What a situation.<br> What am I going to do?<br> It's incredible!<br> Anyway, today I hondled with InterCity's<br> lawyer for two hours and we got close...<br> ...really close, to big dollars for you,<br> Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Rodrigo.<br> But I think we're going to make out<br> like bandits.<br> I know, I'm horrible, but listen to this:<br> An hour after the call...<br> ...from the airline lawyer,<br> I get one from the insurance carrier.<br> What a situation!<br> I'm mean, I know.<br> I'm terrible to take advantage...<br> ...but there's been a fuck up<br> in their communication.<br> They both think they're the one<br> who's been designated to deal with me.<br> So I played dumb.<br> Started doing numbers with<br> the insurance guy and his offer is higher!<br> Millions, we're talking millions!<br> Oh, shit!<br> This is it.<br> This is the moment of my death.<br> We'll make it, Max.<br> He's going to bring us in.<br> - He'll bring us in.<br> - There's a boy alone up there.<br> I'm going to sit with him.<br> It's going to be okay.<br> Everything's okay.<br> Now, put your head down.<br> Close your eyes.<br> It'll be over soon.<br> Everything's wonderful.<br> In the kitchen, there is a phone!<br> It's an emergency! It's an allergic reaction!<br> Stop it! What's happening? Dad!<br> No, Max! No!<br> I'm alive!<br> I'm alive!<br> I'm alive!<br>
