                        A fiddler on the roof.<br> Sounds crazy, no?<br> But here in our<br> little village of Anatevka,<br> you might say<br> every one of us<br> is a fiddler on the roof,<br> trying to scratch out<br> a pleasant, simple tune<br> without breaking his neck.<br> It isn't easy.<br> You may ask,<br> "Why do we stay up there<br> "if it's so dangerous?"<br> Well, we stay because<br> Anatevka is our home.<br> And how do we keep our balance?<br> That I can tell you in one word.<br> Tradition!<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Because of our traditions,<br> we've kept our balance<br> for many, many years.<br> Here in Anatevka,<br> we have traditions for everything.<br> How to sleep, how to eat,<br> how to work,<br> how to wear clothes.<br> For instance,<br> we always keep our heads covered<br> and always wear a little prayer shawl.<br> This shows our constant<br> devotion to God.<br> You may ask,<br> "How did this tradition get started?"<br> I'll tell you.<br> I don't know.<br> But it's a tradition.<br> And because of our traditions,<br> every one of us knows who he is<br> and what God expects him to do.<br> Who, day and night<br> Must scramble for a living<br> Feed a wife and children<br> Say his daily prayers?<br> And who has the right<br> As master of the house<br> To have the final word at home?<br> The Papa<br> The Papa<br> Tradition<br> The Papa<br> The Papa<br> Tradition<br> Who must know the way<br> To make a proper home<br> A quiet home<br> A kosher home?<br> Who must raise the family<br> And run the home<br> So Papa's free to read<br> The holy book<br> The Mama<br> The Mama<br> Tradition<br> The Mama<br> The Mama<br> Tradition<br> At three I started Hebrew school<br> At ten I learned a trade<br> I hear they've picked a bride for me<br> I hope she's pretty<br> And who does Mama teach<br> To mend and tend and fix<br> Preparing her to marry<br> Whoever Papa picks?<br> The daughters<br> The daughters<br> Tradition<br> - The Papa<br> - The Mama<br> - Son<br> - The daughters<br> Tradition<br> And in the circle of our little village<br> we've always had our special types.<br> For instance,<br> Yente, the matchmaker,<br> Reb Nachum, the beggar.<br> And, most important of all,<br> our beloved rabbi.<br> Rabbi, may I ask you a question?<br> Certainly, Leybish.<br> Is there a proper blessing for the Tsar?<br> A blessing for the Tsar? Of course.<br> May God bless and keep the Tsar<br> far away from us.<br> Then there are<br> the others in our village.<br> They make a much bigger circle.<br> We don't bother them,<br> and, so far, they don't bother us.<br> And among ourselves,<br> we always get along perfectly well.<br> Of course, there was the time<br> when he sold him a horse<br> and told him it was only six years old<br> when it was really 12.<br> But now it's all over,<br> and we all live<br> in simple peace and harmony.<br> It was really 12 years old.<br> It was six.<br> Tevye knows it was 12.<br> Twelve! Twelve!<br> It was 12!<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Tradition<br> Traditions, traditions.<br> Without our traditions,<br> our lives would be as shaky as...<br> As...<br> As a fiddler on the roof.<br> Mama, Mama!<br> Yente, the matchmaker, is coming.<br> Maybe she's finally found<br> a good match for you, Tzeitel.<br> From your mouth to God's ears.<br> Why does she have to come now?<br> It's almost Sabbath.<br> Out, all of you.<br> I want to talk to Yente alone.<br> But, Mama, the men she finds.<br> The last one was so old and he was bald.<br> He had no hair.<br> A poor girl without a dowry<br> can't be so particular.<br> You want hair, marry a monkey.<br> Even a poor girl without a dowry<br> has to look at her husband sometime.<br> A husband is not to look at.<br> A husband is to get.<br> But, Mama, I'm not yet 20 years old.<br> I don't think I have...<br> Do you have to boast about your age?<br> Do you want to tempt the evil eye?<br> Out, all of you. There's work to be done<br> before the Sabbath.<br> Hurry. All of you, hurry.<br> Golde. Golde.<br> I have such news for you.<br> And not "every day in the week" news.<br> "Once in a lifetime" news.<br> Such diamonds, such jewels.<br> I'll find a husband<br> for every one of them,<br> but you shouldn't be so picky, right?<br> Of course "right," because after all,<br> even the worst husband, God forbid,<br> is better than no husband,<br> God forbid.<br> And who should know better than me?<br> Ever since my husband died,<br> I've been a poor widow.<br> All alone, no one to talk to,<br> nothing to say to anyone.<br> All I do at night is think of him.<br> And even thinking of him<br> gives me no pleasure.<br> Is Tzeitel in the house?<br> Why don't you go in and find out?<br> Thank you, Bielke.<br> He never raised his voice.<br> Good afternoon. Is Tzeitel in the house?<br> She's busy. Come back later.<br> But there's something<br> I'd like to tell her.<br> Later.<br> Later?<br> All right.<br> What does that poor, skinny tailor<br> want with Tzeitel?<br> They have been friends<br> since they were babies.<br> They talk, they play.<br> They play. What do they play?<br> I don't know. They're children.<br> From such children come other children.<br> Motel is nothing.<br> Yente.<br> Yente, you said you had news for me.<br> Children, children.<br> They are your blessing in your old age.<br> But my Aaron, may he rest in peace,<br> couldn't give me children.<br> To tell you the truth, Golde,<br> he hardly tried.<br> But what's the use complaining?<br> Other women enjoy complaining,<br> not Yente.<br> Not every woman in the world is a Yente.<br> Well, I...<br> I have to go home now<br> to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.<br> So goodbye, Golde,<br> and it was a pleasure<br> talking our hearts out to each other.<br> Yente, you said you had news for me.<br> Oy, I'm losing my head.<br> Someday it'll fall off altogether,<br> and a horse will kick it in the mud,<br> and "Goodbye, Yente."<br> Of course, the news.<br> It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher.<br> A good man. A fine man.<br> And I don't have to tell you<br> he's well-off, no?<br> Yes.<br> But he's lonely, the poor man.<br> After all,<br> he's been a widower all these years.<br> You understand. Of course you do.<br> So, to make it short.<br> Out of the whole town,<br> he's cast his eye on Tzeitel.<br> My Tzeitel?<br> No, the Tsar's Tzeitel.<br> Of course your Tzeitel.<br> Such a match for my Tzeitel.<br> But... But Tevye wants a learned man.<br> He doesn't like Lazar.<br> Good, so Lazar won't marry him.<br> He wants the daughter, not the father.<br> Listen. Listen to me, Golde.<br> You send Tevye to him.<br> Don't tell him what it's about.<br> Let Lazar discuss it himself.<br> He'll win him over.<br> He's a good man and a wealthy man.<br> So, you'll let me know how it went.<br> And you don't have to thank me, Golde,<br> because aside from my fee,<br> which Lazar will pay anyway,<br> it gives me satisfaction<br> to make people happy.<br> True? Of course, "true".<br> So goodbye, Golde, and you're welcome.<br> Goodbye, Yente.<br> Come, come, children,<br> get changed for the Sabbath.<br> Hurry. Hurry with your work.<br> I wonder if Yente<br> found a husband for you.<br> I'm not anxious for Yente<br> to find me a husband.<br> Not unless it's Motel, the tailor.<br> I didn't ask you.<br> Tzeitel, you're the oldest.<br> They have to make a match for you<br> before they can make one for me.<br> And then after her, one for me.<br> - So if Yente...<br> - Yente, Yente, Yente.<br> Well, somebody has to arrange<br> the matches.<br> Well, she might<br> bring someone wonderful.<br> Someone interesting.<br> - And well-off.<br> - And important.<br> Matchmaker, matchmaker<br> Make me a match<br> Find me a find<br> Catch me a catch<br> Matchmaker, matchmaker<br> Look through your book<br> And make me a perfect match<br> Matchmaker, matchmaker<br> I'll bring the veil<br> You bring the groom<br> Slender and pale<br> Bring me a ring<br> For I'm longing to be<br> The envy of all I see<br> For Papa, make him a scholar<br> For Mama, make him rich as a king<br> For me, well, I wouldn't holler<br> If he were as handsome as anything<br> Matchmaker, matchmaker<br> Make me a match<br> Find me a find<br> Catch me a catch<br> Night after night<br> In the dark I'm alone<br> So find me a match<br> Of my own<br> Since when are you interested<br> in a match, Chava?<br> I thought you just had<br> your eye on your books.<br> And you have your eye<br> on the rabbi's son.<br> Well, why not?<br> We only have one rabbi.<br> And he only has one son.<br> Why shouldn't I want the best?<br> Because you're a girl<br> from a poor family,<br> so whatever Yente brings, you'll take.<br> Right? Of course, "right".<br> Hodel, oh Hodel<br> Have I made a match for you<br> He's handsome, he's young<br> Alright he's 62<br> But he's a nice man<br> A good catch<br> True?<br> True<br> I promise you'll be happy<br> And even if you're not<br> There's more to life than that<br> Don't ask me what<br> Chava, I found him<br> You'll be a lucky bride<br> He's handsome, he's tall<br> That is from side to side<br> But he's a nice man<br> A good catch<br> - Right?<br> - Right<br> - You heard he has a temper<br> - He'll beat you every night<br> But only when he's sober<br> So you're alright<br> Did you think you'd get a prince?<br> Well I'll find the best I can<br> With no<br> Dowry, no money<br> No family background<br> Be glad you've got a man<br> Matchmaker, matchmaker<br> You know that I'm<br> Still very young<br> Please, take your time<br> Up to this minute I misunderstood<br> That I could get stuck for good<br> Dear Yenthe<br> See that he's gentle<br> Remember<br> You were also a bride<br> It's not that<br> I'm sentimental<br> It's just that I'm terrified<br> Matchmaker, matchmaker<br> Plan me no plans<br> I'm in no rush<br> Maybe I've learned<br> Playing with matches<br> A girl can get burned<br> So<br> Bring me no ring<br> Groom me no groom<br> Find me no find<br> Catch me no catch<br> Unless he's a matchless match<br> Dear God,<br> was that necessary?<br> Did you have to make him lame<br> just before the Sabbath?<br> That wasn't nice.<br> It's enough you pick on me,<br> bless me with five daughters,<br> a life of poverty. That's all right,<br> but what have you<br> got against my horse?<br> Really,<br> sometimes I think<br> when things are too quiet up there,<br> you say to yourself,<br> "Let's see. What kind of mischief<br> can I play on my friend Tevye?"<br> Aha! So you're finally<br> here, my breadwinner.<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> So why are you late today?<br> His foot went lame.<br> Well, hurry up.

Stop braying like a pack of mules<br> and let a man talk. Talk, Avram.<br> Well, my paper came<br> to the post office today<br> like it does every week.<br> Though usually it comes on a Thursday,<br> - but sometimes...<br> - Avram, that's not talking.<br> That's babbling.<br> - Tell us the news.<br> - What does it say?<br> Quiet!<br> Talk, Avram.<br> Well, I was reading my paper.<br> It's nothing very important.<br> A story about the crops in the Ukraine<br> and this and that.<br> Avram, talk.<br> And then, I saw this.<br> All right.<br> We all see it.<br> What does it say?<br> "In a village called Rajanka,<br> "all the Jews were evicted,<br> "forced to leave their homes."<br> For what reason?<br> It doesn't say.<br> Maybe the Tsar wanted their land.<br> Maybe a plague.<br> May the Tsar have<br> his own personal plague!<br> - Amen!<br> - Amen!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Why don't you ever bring us<br> some good news?<br> It's not my fault.<br> I only read it.<br> "An edict from the authorities."<br> May the authorities grow like onions<br> with their heads in the ground.<br> - Amen!<br> - Amen!<br> What good will your cursing do?<br> You stand around,<br> you curse, and you chatter,<br> and you don't do anything.<br> You'll all chatter your way<br> into the grave.<br> Excuse me.<br> You're not from this village.<br> No.<br> Where are you from?<br> Kiev.<br> I was a student in the university there.<br> The university.<br> Tell me,<br> is that a place where you learned<br> how not to respect your elders?<br> That is where I learned<br> there is more to life than talk.<br> You should know<br> what's going on in the outside world.<br> Careful, my paper.<br> Why should I break my head<br> about the outside world?<br> Let the outside world<br> break its own head.<br> Well put.<br> He's right.

I apologize.<br> Here.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> - Tevye, the rabbi's order.<br> Of course.<br> So you are from Kiev, Reb...<br> - Perchik.<br> - Perchik.<br> So you are a newcomer here?<br> As Abraham said,<br> "I'm a stranger in a strange land."<br> Moses said that.<br> Forgive me. Forgive me.<br> As King David said,<br> "I'm slow of speech and slow of tongue."<br> That was also Moses.<br> For a man with a slow tongue,<br> he talked a lot.<br> Here, Reb Perchik.<br> Have a piece.<br> I have no money, and I'm not a beggar.<br> Take it. It's a blessing for me to give.<br> Very well.<br> For your sake.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> You know, it's no crime to be poor.<br> In this world it is the rich<br> who are the criminals.<br> Someday their wealth will be ours.<br> That would be nice.<br> If they would agree, I would agree.<br> And who will make this miracle<br> to come to pass?<br> People. Ordinary people.<br> Like you?<br> Like me.<br> And until your golden day<br> comes, Reb Perchik,<br> how will you live?<br> By giving lessons to children.<br> Do you have any children?<br> I have five daughters.<br> Five?<br> Daughters!<br> Girls should learn, too.<br> Girls are people.<br> - A radical!<br> - Go away.<br> I'd be willing to teach them.<br> Open their minds to great thoughts.<br> Yeah?<br> I'd like them to know the Good Book.<br> Well, the Bible has many lessons<br> for our times.<br> Perchik,<br> I'm a very poor man,<br> but food for lessons, huh?<br> Good. Good.<br> Stay with us for the Sabbath.<br> Of course, we don't eat like kings,<br> but we don't starve, either.<br> As the Good Book says,<br> "When a poor man eats a chicken,<br> "one of them is sick."<br> Where does the book say that?<br> All right. All right.<br> It doesn't exactly say that,<br> but someplace it has something<br> about a chicken.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> Good Sabbath.<br> Do you really<br> think Yente found someone?<br> I don't know.<br> Good Sabbath, children.<br> Good Sabbath, Papa.<br> Children, this is Perchik.<br> Perchik, this is my eldest daughter.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> You have a pleasant daughter.<br> I have five pleasant daughters.<br> - This is mine.<br> - Good Sabbath.<br> - And this is mine.<br> - Good Sabbath, Papa.<br> And this is mine.<br> And this...<br> Well, this is not mine.<br> Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil.<br> So, you did us a favour and came home.<br> Well, this is also mine.<br> Golde, Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev.<br> He'll be staying the Sabbath with us.<br> He is a teacher.<br> Would you like<br> to take lessons from him?<br> - Yes, Papa.<br> - Good.<br> I'm a very good teacher.<br> I heard once that the rabbi<br> who must praise himself<br> has a congregation of one.<br> Your daughter has<br> a quick and witty tongue.<br> Yeah, the wit she gets from me.<br> As the Good Book says...<br> The Good Book can wait. Get washed.<br> This tongue she gets from her mother.<br> Motel, you're also eating with us?<br> - If...<br> - Of course. Another blessing.<br> Tzeitel, Tzeitel, get the small table.<br> And, Chava, the two chairs from outside.<br> Children, finish dressing.<br> You can wash at the well.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Hurry, Hodel, help him. Hurry.<br> Hurry. It's almost the Sabbath. Hurry!<br> Tevye.<br> Tevye, I have something to say to you.<br> Why should today be different?<br> Tevye, I have something to tell you.<br> - Tzeitel, I have something to tell you.<br> - Motel,<br> - Yente was here.<br> - I know. I saw her.<br> If they agree on someone,<br> there will be a match,<br> and then it will be too late for us.<br> But, Tzeitel, I have found someone who<br> will sell me his used sewing machine.<br> So maybe in a few weeks<br> I'll have saved up enough to buy it.<br> - And then your father...<br> - A few weeks might be too late.<br> Lazar Wolf wants to see you.<br> The butcher? What is it about?<br> I don't know,<br> only he says it's important.<br> What can be important?<br> I have nothing for him to slaughter.<br> After the Sabbath,<br> see him, talk with him.<br> Talk about what?<br> If he is thinking about buying<br> my new milk cow,<br> he can forget it.<br> Tevye, I want you to talk...<br> Tevye.<br> Tevye, I want you to talk to...<br> What else can I do?<br> You could ask my father<br> for my hand tonight.<br> Now.<br> Why should he consider me now?<br> I'm only a poor tailor.<br> And I'm only the daughter<br> of a poor milkman.<br> Just talk to him.<br> Tzeitel, if your father says no,<br> that's it. It's final.<br> - He'll yell at me.<br> - Motel.<br> I'm just a poor tailor.<br> Motel, even a poor tailor<br> is entitled to some happiness.<br> That's true.<br> Amen.<br> A man sends you an important message,<br> at least you can talk to him.<br> - I don't want to talk to...<br> - Talk to him!<br> All right!<br> After the Sabbath, I'll talk to him.<br> All right. I'll talk to him.<br> Well, it's getting late.<br> Where is everybody?<br> I don't know, Papa.<br> Children! Come down, children!<br> We are lighting the candles. Children!<br> - Reb Tevye.<br> - Not now, Motel.<br> Hurry up, children!

Thank you.<br> And all this from<br> killing innocent animals.<br> Don't touch anything.<br> All right.<br> Well, Tevye.<br> You're here.<br> Well, sit down, sit down.<br> - Thank you, thank you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Have a drink.<br> I won't insult you by saying no.<br> Well,<br> how goes it with you, Reb Tevye?<br> How should it go?<br> You're right.<br> And you?<br> The same.<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> How is your brother-in-law<br> in America?<br> He's doing very well.<br> - He wrote you?<br> - No, not lately.<br> Then how do you know?<br> If he was doing badly, he would write.<br> - L'chayim.<br> - L'chayim.<br> - Tevye.<br> - Yeah?<br> I suppose you know<br> why I wanted to see you.<br> Oh, yes, I do,<br> but there is no use talking about it.<br> Tevye, I understand how you feel,<br> but, after all,<br> you have a few more without her.<br> I see.<br> Today you want one.<br> Tomorrow you may want two.<br> Two? What...<br> What would I do with two?<br> The same as you do with one.<br> Tevye.<br> This is very important to me.<br> Why is it so important to you?<br> Frankly,<br> because<br> I'm lonely.<br> Lonely?<br> Reb Lazar,<br> what are you talking about?<br> How can a little cow keep you company?<br> Little cow?<br> Is that what you call her?<br> What else should I call her?<br> That's what she is.<br> - Reb Lazar, what are you talking about?<br> - Don't you know?<br> Of course I know.<br> We are talking about my new milk cow,<br> the one you want to buy from me.<br> A milk cow?<br> A milk cow so I won't be lonely?<br> I'm... I'm talking about<br> your daughter.<br> Your daughter, Tzeitel.<br> My daughter, Tzeitel?<br> Of course. Your daughter, Tzeitel.<br> I see her every Thursday<br> in my butcher shop,<br> and she's made<br> a very good impression on me,<br> a very good impression.<br> Reb Tevye,<br> I like her.<br> Why don't we just shake hands<br> and call it a match?<br> And<br> I'll be good to her.<br> Tevye.<br> I...<br> I like her.<br> Well?<br> What do you think?<br> What do I think?<br> I never really liked him.<br> Why should I?<br> You can have<br> a fine conversation with him<br> if you talk about kidneys and livers.<br> On the other hand,<br> not everyone has to be a scholar.<br> And with a butcher,<br> my daughter<br> will surely never know hunger.<br> Maybe I misjudged him.<br> He's a good man.<br> He likes her.<br> And he'll try to make her happy.<br> What do I think?<br> It's a match.<br> - You agree?<br> - I agree.<br> Tevye, you've made me a happy man.<br> - Good.<br> - Let's drink on it.<br> Why not?<br> To you.<br> No, my friend. To you.<br> To the both of us.<br> - To our agreement.<br> - To our agreement.<br> To our prosperity.<br> To our good health and happiness.<br> And most important of all...<br> Well...<br> To life, to life<br> L'chayim<br> L'chayim, l'chayim<br> To life<br> Here's to the father<br> I've tried to be<br> Here's to my bride-to-be<br> Drink l'chayim to life<br> To life, l'chayim<br> L'chayim, l'chayim<br> To life<br> Life has a way of<br> Confusing us<br> Blessing and bruising us<br> Drink l'chayim<br> To life<br> God would like us to be joyful<br> Even when our hearts lie<br> Panting on the floor<br> How much more can we be joyful<br> When there's really something<br> To be joyful for<br> To life, to life<br> L'chayim<br> - To Tzeitel, my daughter<br> - My wife<br> It gives you something<br> To think about<br> Something to drink about<br> Drink l'chayim<br> To life<br> - Mordcha!<br> - Yes.

Like this.<br> I learned it in Kiev.<br> You like it?<br> It's... It's very nice.<br> There.<br> We've just changed an old custom.<br> Yes.<br> I mean, thank you.<br> I mean,<br> good day!<br> - So, my prince is finally out of bed.<br> - Oh, God! Not now. Not now.<br> - Open your eyes. The day's half gone.<br> - Go away!<br> Well?<br> Well, what happened last night besides<br> your drinking like a peasant?<br> Did you see Lazar Wolf?<br> Well?<br> Well?<br> Well, what did he say?<br> What did you say?<br> Where...<br> - Where... Where is Tzeitel?<br> - She's in the barn.<br> - In the barn.<br> - Do you have news for me?<br> - Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?<br> - Oh, the other way.<br> Well, what happened?<br> Patience, woman, patience.<br> As the Good Book says,<br> "Good news will stay,<br> "and bad news will refuse to leave."<br> And there is another saying that goes...<br> You can die from such a man.<br> Did you see Lazar?<br> - Was it friendly?<br> - Shah, woman, shah!<br> Are you still drunk, or what?<br> Here she is.<br> Tzeitel, my lamb, come here.<br> You are to be congratulated.<br> You are going to be married.<br> Married?<br> What do you mean, Papa?<br> Lazar Wolf has asked for your hand.<br> I knew it!<br> The butcher?<br> Oh, dear God, I thank thee.<br> I thank thee!<br> Why do you have to...<br> What do you have to say, Tzeitel?<br> What can she say?<br> Let her say one word.<br> My first-born, a bride.<br> May you grow old with him,<br> in fortune and honour.<br> Not like Fruma Sarah,<br> that first wife of Lazar's.<br> She was a bitter woman.<br> May she rest in peace.<br> Not like my Tzeitel.<br> And now, I must thank Yente.<br> My Tzeitel, a bride.<br> A bride, I thank thee.<br> I thank thee!<br> - A bride! A bride!<br> - Well, Chava?<br> Mazel tov, Tzeitel.<br> "Mazel tov, Tzeitel"?<br> What kind of a mazel tov is that?<br> And you, Reb Perchik, aren't<br> you going to congratulate her?<br> Congratulations, Tzeitel.<br> For getting a rich man.<br> Ah!<br> Again with the rich.<br> What's wrong with being rich?<br> It's no reason to marry.<br> Money's the world's curse.<br> May the lord smite me with it,<br> and may I never recover!<br> World's curse.<br> My Tzeitel knows<br> I mean only her welfare.<br> Am I right, Tzeitel?<br> - Yes, Papa.<br> - There, you see?<br> I see.<br> I see very well.<br> Well, my child,<br> why are you so silent?<br> Aren't you happy with this blessing?<br> Papa.<br> - Papa.<br> - What is it? Tell me.<br> Papa, I don't want to marry him.<br> I can't marry him. I can't.<br> What do you mean, you can't?<br> If I say you will,<br> you will.<br> Papa, if it's a matter of money,<br> I'll do anything.<br> I'll hire myself out as a servant.<br> - Just, I don't...<br> - But we made an agreement!<br> And with us,<br> an agreement is an agreement.<br> Is that<br> more important than I am, Papa?<br> Papa, don't force me, please!<br> I'll be unhappy all my days!<br> - I don't want to marry him.<br> - All right.<br> All right.<br> I won't force you.<br> Thank you, Papa, thank you.<br> "Thank you, Papa."<br> It seems it was not ordained<br> that you should have<br> all the comforts of life.<br> Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?<br> Later, Motel, later.<br> But I would like to speak to you.<br> Not now, not now. I have problems.<br> That's what I want<br> to speak to you about.<br> I think I can help.<br> Certainly,<br> like a bandage can help a corpse.<br> Goodbye, Motel, goodbye.<br> At least listen to him, Papa.<br> All right.

Tzeitel.<br> Good day, Yente.<br> Tzeitel, I happened to stop in the post<br> office today to say hello, see what's what.<br> It doesn't cost anything to be friendly.<br> So few people are like that.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> People.<br> I tell you, Tzeitel,<br> if God lived on Earth,<br> people would break his windows.<br> So you went to the post office?<br> Yes, and the postman told me there was<br> a letter there for your sister, Hodel.<br> Thanks. I'll go get it.<br> I got it.<br> It's from her intended, Perchik.<br> Hodel will be so happy.<br> She's been waiting<br> to hear from him for...<br> But it's open.<br> So it happened to be open.<br> You don't have<br> to wait for the train, Papa.<br> You'll be late for your customers.<br> That's all right.<br> They will just have to wait for a while.<br> Is he in bad trouble,<br> that hero of yours?<br> Arrested?<br> Convicted?<br> Yes, but he did nothing wrong.<br> He cares nothing for himself.<br> Everything he does is for other people.<br> Yes, but if he did nothing wrong,<br> he wouldn't be in trouble.<br> Oh, Papa. How can you say that?<br> What wrongs did Joseph do?<br> And Abraham and Moses?<br> And they had troubles.<br> Yes, but...<br> But why won't you tell me<br> where he is now, this<br> Joseph of yours?<br> It is far, Papa.<br> Terribly far.<br> He is in a settlement in Siberia.<br> Siberia?<br> And he asks you to leave<br> your father and mother<br> and join him in that frozen<br> wasteland and marry him there?<br> No, Papa.<br> He did not ask me to go.<br> I want to go.<br> I don't want him to be alone.<br> I want to help him in his work.<br> Hodel.<br> Papa.<br> How can I hope<br> To make you understand<br> Why I do<br> What I do<br> Why I must travel<br> To a distant land<br> Far from the home I love<br> Once I was happily<br> Content to be<br> As I was<br> Where I was<br> Close to the people<br> Who are close to me<br> Here in the home I love<br> Who could see<br> That a man would come<br> Who would change the shape<br> Of my dreams<br> Helpless now<br> I stand with him<br> Watching<br> Older dreams grow dim<br> Oh, what a melancholy<br> Choice this is<br> Wanting home<br> Wanting him<br> Closing my heart<br> To every hope but his<br> Leaving the home I love<br> There where my heart<br> Has settled long ago<br> I must go<br> I must go<br> Who could imagine<br> I'd be wandering so<br> Far from the home I love<br> Yet<br> There with my love<br> I'm home<br> And who, my child,<br> will there be to perform a marriage<br> there in the wilderness?<br> Papa, I promise you,<br> we will be married under a canopy.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Yes.<br> No doubt a rabbi or two<br> were also arrested.<br> Papa!<br> God alone knows<br> when we shall see each other again.<br> Then,<br> we will leave it in his hands.<br> Take care of her.<br> See that she dresses warm.<br> Even though<br> she only burned his cooking,<br> he is permitted to divorce her.<br> Just for supper?<br> Yes, yes, yes.<br> I'm sorry, Rabbi.<br> Yes, of course.<br> What news of the outside world, Avram?<br> It's terrible, Rabbi. Terrible.<br> Then don't tell me.<br> If I want bad news, I'll read<br> about Noah and the flood.<br> Tell me, Avram,<br> surely somewhere there are<br> good things happening?<br> Can't you buy a paper<br> that prints those things?<br> It's not my fault, Rabbi.<br> I only read it.<br> Rabbi, Rabbi, did you hear the news?<br> More bad news?<br> No, good news!<br> At Motel's and Tzeitel's,<br> a new arrival.<br> A new arrival at Motel's and Tzeitel's?<br> I'm so excited!<br> I must congratulate them!<br> - It's wonderful.<br> - So cute!<br> We just heard the good news. Mazel tov!<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - It's a nice thing.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> - Very nice.<br> - Thank you.<br> What is it?<br> It's a sewing machine.<br> It's a sewing machine.<br> - It can work twice as fast.<br> - Hey.<br> You got it!<br> I got it!<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - I know.<br> - Have you tried it yet?<br> - Look.<br> - Beautiful.<br> - I know.<br> And in less than a minute.<br> See how close and even<br> the stitches are?<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - I know.<br> From now on,<br> my clothes will be perfect.<br> Made by machine. No<br> more handmade clothes.<br> Look, Mama. Look!<br> Oh!<br> It's wonderful.<br> Mazel tov, Motel!<br> The rabbi!<br> The rabbi! The rabbi!<br> Rabbi, is there a blessing<br> for a sewing machine?<br> There is a blessing for everything.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> That's your new arrival?<br> What is it, a boy or a girl?<br> Yankeleh. Yankeleh.<br> Why isn't he asleep?<br> Oh, Mama, but he's wonderful.<br> He never cries or...<br> Shah! Do you want to invite bad luck?<br> Well...<br> Well, Motel,<br> I never thought<br> you'd amount to anything.<br> But look at you,<br> a baby and a sewing machine.<br> You're a person.<br> - Look, I'll show you how it works.<br> - Go, children.<br> Come here.<br> - Go, children.<br> - First you put the cloth in like this.<br> It's an amazing thing.<br> You work it<br> with your foot and your hand.<br> Your father is coming.<br> Chava, let me talk to him.<br> Let me tell him about us.<br> No, Fyedka. That would be<br> the worst thing. I'm sure of it.<br> - But let me try.<br> - No.<br> I'll talk to him.<br> I promise.<br> Good afternoon, sir.<br> Good afternoon.<br> It's... It's a cold day, isn't it?<br> Mmm.<br> Well,<br> good day, sir.<br> - Good day, Chava.<br> - Good day.<br> What were you and he talking about?<br> Nothing. We were just talking.<br> Good.<br> Papa.<br> Fyedka and I,<br> we've known each other<br> for a long time now and...<br> Chaveleh,<br> I would be much happier<br> if you would remain friends<br> from a distance.<br> You must not forget who you are<br> and who that man is.<br> He has a name, Papa.<br> Of course.<br> All creatures on earth have a name.<br> Fyedka is not a creature, Papa.<br> Fyedka is a man.<br> Who says he isn't?<br> It's just that he<br> is a different kind of man.<br> As the Good Book says,<br> "Each shall seek his own kind."<br> In other words, a bird may love a fish,<br> but where would they build<br> a home together?<br> The world is changing, Papa.<br> No, Chaveleh.<br> No.<br> Some things do not change for us.<br> Some things will never change.<br> We don't feel that way.<br> We?<br> Fyedka and I.<br> We want to be married.<br> What, are you out of your mind?<br> What?<br> Don't you understand what that means,<br> marrying outside of the faith?<br> - But, Papa...<br> - No!<br> I said, no!<br> Never talk about it again.<br> Never mention his name again.<br> Never see him again.<br> Never.<br> Do you understand me?<br> Yes, Papa.<br> I understand you.<br> You're finally here.<br> Let's go home. It's late for supper.<br> I want to see Motel's new machine.<br> You'll see it another time.<br> It's getting late.<br> Quiet, woman, before I get angry!<br> Because when I get angry,<br> even flies don't dare to fly!<br> I'm very frightened of you.<br> After we finish supper, I'll faint.<br> Golde!<br> I am the man in the house!<br> I am the head of the family!<br> And I want to see Motel's<br> new machine now!<br> Now, let's go home.<br> What are you doing here?<br> What do you want?<br> May I see his honour, the priest?<br> - The reverend father?<br> - Yes.<br> Why do you want to see him?<br> It's a family matter.<br> A personal matter.<br> - My daughter.<br> - Yes. What about your daughter?<br> Please, if I could speak with the...<br> If I could speak<br> with the reverend father.<br> Please.<br> Wait here.<br> Tevye!<br> Tevye!<br> What is it?<br> It's Chava.<br> She left home this<br> morning with Fyedka.<br> What?<br> I've looked everywhere for her.<br> I even went to the priest.<br> He told me they were married.<br> - Married?<br> - Yes.<br> Well.<br> Go home, Golde.<br> We have other children at home.<br> You have work to do. I have work to do.<br> Go home.<br> But Chaveleh?<br> Chava is dead to us.<br> We'll forget her.<br> Go home.<br> Go home, Golde.<br> Home.<br> Little bird<br> Little Chaveleh<br> I don't understand what's happening today<br> Everything is all a blur<br> All I can see is a happy child<br> The sweet little bird you were<br> Chaveleh<br> Chaveleh<br> Little bird<br> Little Chaveleh<br> You were always such a pretty little thing<br> Everybody's favourite child<br> Gentle and kind and affectionate<br> What a sweet little bird you were<br> Chaveleh<br> Chaveleh<br> Papa?<br> Papa!<br> Papa, I've been looking<br> everywhere for you.<br> Papa, stop!<br> At least listen to me.<br> Papa.<br> I beg you to accept us.<br> Accept them?<br> How can I accept them?<br> Can I deny everything I believe in?<br> On the other hand,<br> can I deny my own daughter?<br> On the other hand,<br> how can I turn my back<br> on my faith, my people?<br> If I try and bend that far,<br> I'll break.<br> On the other hand...<br> No.<br> There is no other hand.<br> No, Chava!<br> No!<br> - But, Papa...<br> - No! No!<br> Papa!<br> - No!<br> - Papa!<br> Golde, here they are.<br> The boys I told you about.<br> Wonderful boys, Golde.<br> From good families.<br> Each of them a prize, a jewel.<br> You couldn't do better for your girls.<br> I don't know, Yente.<br> My girls are still so young.<br> So, what do they look like,<br> grandfathers?<br> True. The marriage can wait,<br> but, meanwhile, their future<br> will be all signed and sealed.<br> Which one for which one?<br> What's the difference?<br> Take your pick.<br> They're both wonderful boys.<br> Yankel, the little, fat one<br> is apprenticed to a carpenter.<br> - I'm Yankel.<br> - Did I ask you?<br> Yankel, the skinny one,<br> is apprenticed...<br> Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?<br> He's in the barn.<br> Is there trouble?<br> Stay inside, children.<br> What is it? What's the matter?<br> Tevye. Tevye,<br> have you seen the constable lately?<br> - No. Why?<br> - There are some rumours in town.<br> We thought since you knew him so well,<br> maybe he told you<br> what is true and what is not.<br> Rumours?<br> What rumours?<br> Quiet!<br> Talk, Avram.<br> Someone from Zolodin told me<br> there was an edict issued<br> in St. Petersburg that all...<br> Welcome, Your Honour.<br> What's the good news in the world?<br> I see that you have company.<br> They are my friends.<br> It's just as well.<br> What I have to say<br> is for their ears also.<br> Tevye, how much time do you need to sell<br> your house and all your household goods?<br> Why should I sell my house?<br> Is it in anybody's way?<br> I came here to tell you that you<br> are going to have to leave Anatevka.<br> And how did I come<br> to deserve such an honour?<br> Not just you, of course,<br> but all of you.<br> What?<br> What do you mean?<br> Why?<br> Listen to me!<br> At first, I thought you might be spared, Tevye,<br> because of the marriage of your daughter.<br> My daughter is dead.<br> I understand.<br> At any rate, it affects all of you.<br> You have to leave.<br> But...<br> But this corner of the world<br> has always been our home.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes.<br> Why should we leave?<br> I don't know why.<br> There's trouble in the world.<br> Troublemakers.<br> Like us?<br> You aren't the only ones. Your<br> people must leave all the villages.<br> Zolodin, Rabalevka.<br> The entire district must be emptied!<br> I have an order here!<br> It says that you must sell your homes<br> and be out of here in three days.<br> How? Three days!<br> That's impossible!<br> - What about the children?<br> - Three days?<br> And you,<br> you who have known us all your life,<br> you'd carry out this order?<br> I've nothing to do with it!<br> Don't you understand?<br> I wish you wouldn't say me!<br> I understand.<br> And suppose we refuse to go?<br> You will be forced out!<br> We will defend ourselves.<br> - We'll stay in our homes!<br> - Refuse to leave!<br> - We won't fall.<br> - We will keep our land!<br> - Yes.<br> - Fight!<br> Against our militia, our army?<br> I wouldn't advise that.<br> I have some advice for you.<br> Get off my land.<br> This is still my home, my land.<br> Get off my land.<br> You have three days!<br> After a lifetime,<br> a piece of paper and get thee out.<br> We should get together<br> with the people of Zolodin.<br> Maybe they have a plan.<br> We should defend ourselves!<br> An eye for an eye<br> and a tooth for a tooth!<br> Very good.<br> That way the whole world<br> will be blind and toothless.<br> Rabbi,<br> we've been waiting<br> for the Messiah all our lives.<br> Wouldn't this be<br> a good time for him to come?<br> We'll have to wait<br> for him someplace else.<br> Meanwhile, let's start packing.<br> Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly<br> been the Garden of Eden.<br> That's true.<br> After all, what have we got here?<br> A little bit of this<br> A little bit of that<br> - A pot.<br> - A pan.<br> - A broom.<br> - A hat.<br> Someone should have set a match<br> to this place years ago.<br> - A bench.<br> - A tree.<br> - What's a house?<br> - Or a stove?<br> People who pass through Anatevka<br> don't even know they've been here.<br> A stick of wood.<br> A piece of cloth.<br> What do we leave?<br> Nothing much<br> Only Anatevka<br> Anatevka, Anatevka<br> Underfed, overworked<br> Anatevka<br> Where else would Sabbath be so sweet?<br> Anatevka, Anatevka<br> Intimate, obstinate<br> Anatevka<br> Where I know everyone I meet<br> Soon I'll be a stranger<br> In a strange, new place<br> Searching for<br> An old familiar face<br> From Anatevka<br> I belong in Anatevka<br> Tumbledown, workaday<br> Anatevka<br> Dear little village<br> Little town<br> Of<br> Mine<br> It's just a place.<br> And our forefathers have been forced out<br> of many, many places at a moment's notice.<br> Maybe that's why<br> we always wear our hats.<br> Golde!<br> Golde, darling!<br> I had to see you before I left.<br> Because I have such news for you.<br> You remember, Golde, yesterday I<br> told you I didn't know where to go,<br> what to do with these old bones?<br> Now I know.<br> You want to hear?
