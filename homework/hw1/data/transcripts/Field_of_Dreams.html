                        My father's name was<br> John Kinsella.<br> It's an lrish name.<br> He was born<br> in North Dakota in 1896<br> and never saw a big city until he<br> came back from France in 1918.<br> Settling in Chicago,<br> he learned to live and die<br> with the White Sox.<br> Died a little when they<br> lost the 1919 World Series,<br> died a lot when eight White Sox were<br> accused of throwing that Series.<br> He played some in the minors,<br> but nothing came of it.<br> Moved to Brooklyn in '35,<br> married Mom in '38,<br> was already an old man<br> at the naval yards<br> when I was born in 1952.<br> My name's Ray Kinsella.<br> Mom died when I was three, and I<br> suppose Dad did the best he could.<br> Instead of Mother Goose, I was put<br> to bed to stories of Babe Ruth,<br> Lou Gehrig, and the great<br> Shoeless Joe Jackson.<br> Dad was a Yankees fan then,<br> so I rooted for Brooklyn.<br> In '58, the Dodgers moved away, so we<br> had to find other reasons to fight.<br> We did.<br> When I chose a college,<br> I picked the farthest<br> from home I could find.<br> This drove him up the wall,<br> which, I suppose, was the point.<br> Officially, my major was English,<br> but really, it was the '60s.<br> I marched,<br> I smoked some grass,<br> I tried to like sitar music,<br> and I met Annie.<br> The only thing we had<br> in common<br> was that she came from Iowa,<br> and I'd once heard of lowa.<br> After graduation,<br> we moved to the Midwest<br> and stayed with her family<br> as long as we could,<br> almost a full afternoon.<br> Annie and I got married<br> in June of '74.<br> Dad died that fall.<br> A few years later,<br> Karin was born.<br> She smelled weird,<br> but we loved her anyway.<br> Then Annie got the crazy idea she<br> could talk me into buying a farm.<br> I'm 36 years old,<br> I love my family,<br> I love baseball, and I'm<br> about to become a farmer.<br> But until I heard the voice,<br> I'd never done a crazy thing<br> in my whole life.<br> If you build it,<br> he will come.<br> If you build it, he will come.<br> Hey, Annie!<br> Annie, what was that?<br> What was what?<br> That voice just now.<br> What was it?<br> We didn't hear anything.<br> All right.<br> If you build it,<br> he will come.<br> Okay, you must<br> have heard that!<br> Sorry. Hey,<br> come on in to dinner.<br> Let's go, pumpkin.<br> Is there, like,<br> a sound truck on the highway?<br> Nope. Hey, Karin,<br> dinner's ready!<br> Kids with a radio?<br> Nope.<br> Hey, are you really<br> hearing voices?<br> Just one.<br> What did it say?<br> "If you build it,<br> he will come."<br> if you build what,<br> who will come?<br> He didn't say.<br> I hate it when that happens.<br> Me, too.<br> If you build it,<br> he will come.<br> Build what? What is this?<br> Ray?<br> It's okay, honey. I... I'm<br> just talking to the cornfield.<br> Anyway, I was walking down<br> along the street,<br> and I heard this voice saying,<br> "Good evening, Mr. Dowd."<br> Well, I turned around,<br> and here was this big, six-foot rabbit<br> leaning up against the lamppost.<br> Why did you do that?<br> It was funny.<br> Trust me, Karin.<br> It's not funny.<br> The man is sick. Very sick.<br> Karin, honey,<br> get your book bag. Let's go!<br> Hon, I'll take her today.<br> I've got errands<br> to do in town.<br> Far out.<br> Hey. What if the voice calls<br> while you're gone?<br> Take a message.<br> Bye.<br> Bye.<br> In all those years,<br> did you ever...<br> it's just I've heard that<br> sometimes farmers in the field...<br> They hear things.<br> You know, voices.<br> You hearing voices?<br> No. it's just I heard<br> some farmers do.<br> I, of course, don't, so I was wondering<br> if I was doing something wrong.<br> Did you... Did you ever hear<br> voices out there?<br> Who's hearing voices?<br> Ray is.<br> Out in the fields.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I'm...<br> Noises. That darned tractor...<br> I'm just going to get some 3-in-1 oil.<br> That ought to do it.<br> It was nice...<br> Nice talking to you.<br> If you build it,<br> he will come.<br> All right, that's it!<br> Huh? Who the...<br> Who are you, huh?<br> What do you want from me?<br> Son of a...<br> if you build it,<br> he will come.<br> If you build it...<br> if you build it,<br> he will come.<br> You don't suppose this is like<br> an acid flashback, do you?<br> I never took acid.<br> Maybe you will someday.<br> It's like a flash-forward.<br> Annie, there's more.<br> Honey, why don't you eat<br> a little bit?<br> I... I think I know what "if you<br> build it, he will come" means.<br> Why do I not think<br> this is so good?<br> I think it means that if I build<br> a baseball field out there,<br> Shoeless Joe Jackson will get to<br> come back and play ball again.<br> You're kidding?<br> Uh-uh.<br> Wow.<br> Yeah.<br> You're kidding.<br> Boy, I thought my family was crazy,<br> but this is the craziest thing ever.<br> I know. it's totally nuts.<br> I mean, Shoeless Joe!<br> He's dead. Died in '51.<br> He's dead.<br> They suspended him, right?<br> Right.<br> He's still dead?<br> As far as I know.<br> Did you know<br> Babe Ruth copied his swing?<br> If I did, I've forgotten it.<br> He was supposed to be<br> so graceful and agile.<br> I'd actually like<br> to see him play again,<br> to let him play,<br> to right an old wrong.<br> Wait. Wait a minute, Bosco.<br> Are you actually thinking<br> of doing this?<br> No.<br> I mean, I can't think of one<br> good reason why I should, but...<br> I'm 36. I have a wife,<br> a child, and a mortgage,<br> and I'm scared to death<br> I'm turning into my father.<br> What's your father got<br> to do with all of this?<br> I never forgave him<br> for getting old.<br> By the time he was as old<br> as I am now, he was ancient.<br> I mean, he must have had dreams, but<br> he never did anything about them.<br> For all I know, he may have<br> even heard voices, too,<br> but he sure didn't listen<br> to them.<br> The man never did one spontaneous<br> thing in all the years I knew him.<br> Annie, I'm afraid<br> of that happening to me,<br> and something tells me this may be my<br> last chance to do something about it.<br> I want to build that field.<br> Do you think I'm crazy?<br> Yes.<br> But I also think if you really<br> feel you should do this,<br> then you should do it.<br> What the hell is he doing?<br> He's plowing under his corn.<br> Why?<br> Ty Cobb called him the greatest<br> left fielder of all time.<br> He said his glove was the place<br> where triples go to die.<br> - Could he hit?<br> - Could he hit?<br> Lifetime average .356,<br> third highest in history.<br> Why'd they call him<br> Shoeless Joe?<br> When he was still<br> in the minors,<br> he bought a new pair of spikes<br> and hurt his feet.<br> In the sixth inning, he took them<br> off and played in his socks.<br> The players kidded him,<br> called him "Shoeless Joe,"<br> and the name stuck.<br> He's going<br> to lose his farm.<br> Damned fool.<br> Then in 1919, his team,<br> the Chicago White Sox,<br> they threw the World Series.<br> What's "threw"?<br> It means<br> they lost on purpose.<br> Gamblers paid them to.<br> Except Shoeless Joe.<br> He did take their money,<br> but nobody ever proved he did<br> one thing to lose those games.<br> If he threw it,<br> how do you explain he hit .375 for<br> the Series and committed no errors?<br> I can't.<br> Twelve hits including<br> the Series' only home run,<br> and they said<br> he's trying to lose?<br> It's ridiculous.<br> The commissioner of baseball<br> suspended eight of the players,<br> including the great Shoeless<br> Joe Jackson, for life.<br> What's "suspend"?<br> It means they never<br> let him play the game again.<br> My father said<br> he saw him years later<br> playing under a made-up name in<br> some 10th-rate league in Carolina.<br> He'd put on 50 pounds, and his<br> spring was gone from his step<br> but he could still hit.<br> Dad used to say nobody could<br> hit like Shoeless Joe.<br> I think that's the first time<br> I've ever seen you smile<br> when you mentioned<br> your father.<br> Well...<br> I have just created something<br> totally illogical.<br> That's what I like about it.<br> Am I completely nuts?<br> Not completely.<br> It's a good baseball field,<br> Ray.<br> It's kind of pretty, isn't it?<br> Mmm-hmm.<br> Any sign?<br> Something's going to happen<br> out there.<br> I can feel it.<br> So, for the veteran southpaw,<br> his summer of woes continues.<br> That's four straight hits<br> in the inning.<br> Daddy, what's a "southpaw"?<br> It means<br> a left-handed pitcher, honey.<br> So how bad is it?<br> Well, considering how much<br> less acreage we have for corn,<br> I say we'll probably<br> almost break even.<br> We used up all our savings<br> on that field, Ray.<br> Daddy?<br> Just a minute, Karin.<br> So what are you saying?<br> We can't keep the field?<br> Makes it real hard<br> to keep the farm.<br> Daddy.<br> In a minute, Karin!<br> There's a man out there<br> on your lawn.<br> I'll put up some coffee.<br> Why don't you go on outside?<br> Sorry.<br> I'll get some out there.<br> Hi.<br> Ray Kinsella.<br> Joe Jackson.<br> I bet it's good<br> to be playing again, huh?<br> Getting thrown out of baseball<br> was like having<br> part of me amputated.<br> I've heard<br> that old men wake up<br> and scratch itchy legs that have<br> been dust for over 50 years.<br> That was me.<br> I'd wake up at night<br> with the smell of the ballpark<br> in my nose,<br> with the cool of the grass<br> on my feet,<br> the thrill of the grass.<br> Can you pitch?<br> Yeah,<br> not bad.<br> Don't we need a catcher?<br> Not if you get it<br> near the plate.<br> Right.<br> I'm pitching<br> to Shoeless Joe Jackson.<br> Nice hit.<br> See if you can hit my curve.<br> You can hit the curve ball.<br> Put one right here, huh?<br> Right.<br> Right,<br> you're a low ball hitter.<br> Man, I did love this game.<br> I'd have played<br> for food money.<br> It was the game,<br> the sounds, the smells.<br> Did you ever hold a ball<br> or a glove to your face?<br> Yeah.<br> I used to love traveling on<br> the trains from town to town.<br> The hotels,<br> brass spittoons in the lobbies,<br> brass beds in the rooms.<br> It was the crowd,<br> rising to their feet<br> when the ball was hit deep.<br> Shoot,<br> I'd have played for nothing.<br> It's my family.<br> What's with the lights?<br> Oh, all the stadiums<br> have them now.<br> Even Wrigley Field.<br> It's harder to see the ball.<br> The owners found that more<br> people can attend night games.<br> Owners.<br> Mr. Jackson, this is my wife<br> Annie and my daughter Karin.<br> Ma'am. Hi.<br> Are you a ghost?<br> Karin.<br> She's kidding.<br> That's okay.<br> What do you think?<br> You look real to me.<br> Then I guess I'm real.<br> Would you like to come inside?<br> Thanks. I don't think I can.<br> Can I come back again?<br> Yeah. I built this for you.<br> There are others, you know.<br> There were eight of us. It would<br> really mean a lot to them.<br> Yeah, anytime.<br> They're all welcome here.<br> Hey, is this heaven?<br> No.<br> It's lowa.<br> Where's he going?<br> I don't know.<br> We're keeping this field.<br> You bet your ass we are.<br> You're going to lose<br> your farm, pal.<br> How can you lose<br> something so big?<br> He misplaced the house once.<br> Yeah, but it turned up.<br> Ray, come on. Ray? Ray?<br> This stupid baseball field's<br> going to bankrupt you.<br> If you default on your loan,<br> you're going to lose everything.<br> My partners will give you<br> a fair price.<br> Thanks, Mark.<br> Thanks, Mark, but no.<br> No.<br> What are you holding<br> onto this place for?<br> You never liked lowa.<br> That's not true.<br> You don't know<br> the first thing about farming.<br> I know a lot about farming.<br> More than you think.<br> Well, then how could you plow<br> under your major crop?<br> What's a crop?<br> Come on. That is funny.<br> What's a crop?<br> Daddy,<br> the baseball game is on.<br> Excuse us.<br> Annie, I don't believe<br> this guy.<br> I'm trying to bail him out, and<br> he leaves to watch television.<br> He used to be normal.<br> Yeah.<br> Buck!<br> Whoa!<br> All right.<br> Hoy! Hoy! Hoy!<br> All right! Home base!<br> Watch Joe's feet.<br> A good left fielder<br> knows what pitch is coming.<br> He can tell from the bat's angle<br> which way the ball's heading.<br> Show off!<br> Stick it in your ear, Gandil.<br> If you'd have run like that against<br> Detroit, I'd have won 20 games!<br> For Pete's sakes, Cicotte,<br> that was 68 years ago.<br> Give it up!<br> Hey! You guys want<br> to play ball or what?<br> Muscle-bound jerk.<br> At least I got muscles.<br> At most you got muscles.<br> Come on, asshole! Pitch!<br> Weaver, be nice.<br> Sorry, kid!<br> It's okay. I don't mind.<br> All right, Karin.<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Ray? Honey, Mom<br> and everybody's leaving now.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, well, it was... You know.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Ray, think about what I said.<br> I'm just trying to help.<br> I know.<br> Thought you two were watching<br> some game.<br> It's not really a game.<br> It's more like practice.<br> There's only eight of them.<br> They can't play a real game.<br> Eight of what?<br> Them.<br> Who them?<br> Them them.<br> You don't see them?<br> Karin, honey,<br> what are you watching?<br> The baseball men.<br> Baseball men?<br> Do you see<br> the baseball men right now?<br> Of course I do.<br> What, you really<br> don't see them?<br> It's not very polite to try to<br> make other people feel stupid.<br> Mom, wait a minute.<br> Mom! Wait a minute.<br> Dee. Dee, wait.<br> You don't see these people?<br> It's not funny, Annie.<br> They couldn't see it.<br> This is really interesting.<br> Hey, Ray, look at this.<br> Sixty-eight years since I wore this<br> uniform, still fits me like a glove.<br> You must keep<br> in pretty good shape.<br> Now let's see, I died in '70.<br> That means I haven't had<br> a cigarette in 18 years.<br> You don't smoke, do you?<br> No.<br> Karin! Ray! Dinner!<br> "Ray, dinner."<br> "Dinner, Ray."<br> All right, all right.<br> Come on.<br> Let's hit the showers.<br> See you later.<br> See you, guys.<br> I'm melting! I'm melting!<br> Come on, you knucklehead.<br> That is so cool.<br> Ease his pain.<br> What?<br> I'm sorry. What?<br> I didn't understand. What?<br> Ease his pain.<br> Ease his pain. What...<br> What the hell does that mean,<br> ease his pain?<br> What pain? All right.<br> Whose pain?<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Come on, honey, wash up. We got<br> the PTA meeting after dinner.<br> Talking about banning books<br> again, really subversive books,<br> like The Wizard of Oz,<br> Diary of Anne Frank.<br> What happened to you?<br> The voice is back.<br> You don't have to build<br> a football field, do you?<br> He said, "Ease his pain."<br> Ease whose pain?<br> I asked him. He wouldn't say.<br> Shoeless Joe's?<br> I don't think so.<br> One of the other players?<br> I don't think so.<br> This is a very nonspecific voice out<br> there, and he's starting to piss me off.<br> I was having a fun day today,<br> a good day.<br> Want a fry?<br> And I say,<br> smut and filth like this has<br> no place in our schools.<br> Fascist.<br> I'd like to ease her pain.<br> Mrs. Kessinik, Mrs. Kessinik.<br> That book you're waving about<br> is hardly smut.<br> It's considered by many critics to be<br> the classic novel about the 1960s.<br> It's pornography!<br> No, no. The Supreme Court says<br> it's not.<br> And it's author, Mr. Mann...<br> ls sick!<br> Terence Mann is<br> a Pulitzer Prize winner.<br> He's widely regarded as the<br> finest satirist of his time.<br> He's a pervert!<br> Probably a Communist, too!<br> What planet are<br> these people from?<br> Mr. Harris, the so-called<br> novels of Terence Mann<br> endorse promiscuity,<br> godlessness,<br> the mongrelization<br> of the races,<br> and disrespect to high-ranking<br> officers of the United States Army.<br> And that's why right-thinking school<br> boards all across the country<br> having been banning<br> this man's S-H-l- since 1969.<br> Terence Mann?<br> You know why he stopped writing books.<br> Because he masturbates.<br> Excuse me, madam.<br> Excuse me.<br> Terence Mann was a warm,<br> gentle voice of reason<br> during a time<br> of great madness.<br> He coined the phrase,<br> "Make love, not war."<br> While other people were<br> chanting, "Burn, baby, burn,"<br> he was talking about love<br> and peace and understanding.<br> I cherished his books, and I<br> dearly wish he had written more.<br> Maybe if you had experienced<br> even a little bit of the '60s,<br> you might feel<br> the same way, too.<br> I experienced the '60s.<br> No, you had two '50s and moved<br> right on into the '70s.<br> Annie, look at this.<br> Your husband plowed under his<br> corn and built a baseball field.<br> Now, there's<br> an intelligent response.<br> The weirdo.<br> Annie... Honey, it's all right.<br> I'll be cool.<br> At least he is not<br> a book burner, you Nazi cow.<br> At least I'm not married to the biggest<br> horse's ass in three counties.<br> All right, Beulah,<br> do you want to step outside?<br> Fine!<br> Annie.<br> All right, honey.<br> I've got a better idea.<br> Let's take a vote.<br> Who's for Eva Braun?<br> Who wants to burn books?<br> Who wants to spit on the Constitution of<br> the United States of America? Anybody?<br> All right. Now,<br> who's for the Bill of Rights?<br> Who thinks freedom<br> is a pretty darn good thing?<br> Come on! Come on!<br> Let's see those hands!<br> Who thinks we have to stand<br> up to the kind of censorship<br> they had under Stalin?<br> All right. There you go. America,<br> I love you. I'm proud of you.<br> Let's go.<br> We got to go.<br> This is great!<br> I figured it out.<br> I figured it out.<br> Was that great, or what?<br> I figured it out.<br> It's just like the '60s again!<br> I just figured it out.<br> "Step outside, you Nazi cow."<br> I know whose pain<br> I'm supposed to ease.<br> What? I know whose pain<br> I'm supposed to ease.<br> I just halted the spread<br> of neofascism in America...<br> Terence Mann.<br> What about him?<br> That's whose pain.<br> You sure?<br> I was right about building<br> the field, wasn't I?<br> Well, what's his pain?<br> I don't know.<br> How are you supposed to ease it?<br> I don't know.<br> Ray.<br> Well, Ann...<br> Look, he's my favorite writer,<br> too,<br> but what's Terence Mann<br> got to do with baseball?<br> Annie, it's incredible.<br> By the early '70s,<br> Mann decides people have<br> become either too extremist<br> or too apathetic to listen.<br> So he stops writing books,<br> he starts writing poetry<br> about whales,<br> and then he starts fooling<br> around with a computer.<br> Know what he does now?<br> He writes software for<br> interactive children's videos.<br> They teach kids how to resolve<br> their conflicts peacefully.<br> God, what an amazing guy.<br> What's that got to do<br> with baseball?<br> In the April 1962 issue<br> of Jet Magazine,<br> there's a story called<br> "This ls Not A Kite."<br> it's not his best work,<br> but the story's hero<br> is named John Kinsella,<br> my father.<br> Wow.<br> What do you mean, "Wow"?<br> Big wow! What's it got to do<br> with baseball?<br> You drive.<br> Okay, the last interview<br> he ever gave was in 1973.<br> Guess what it's about.<br> Some kind of team sport.<br> Mann was a baseball fanatic.<br> Listen to this.<br> "My earliest recurring dream<br> was to play at Ebbets Field<br> "with Jackie Robinson<br> and the Brooklyn Dodgers.<br> "It never happened.<br> The Dodgers left Brooklyn.<br> "Ebbets Field is gone,<br> but I still dream that dream."<br> That's sad.<br> The man wrote the best<br> books of his generation.<br> He was a pioneer in the civil<br> rights and the antiwar movement.<br> I mean, he made<br> the cover of Newsweek.<br> He knew everybody. He did everything.<br> He helped shape his time.<br> The guy hung out<br> with the Beatles.<br> It wasn't enough.<br> What he missed was baseball.<br> Oh, my God!<br> What?<br> "As a small boy,<br> he had a bat named Rosebud."<br> Give me that.<br> Sorry.<br> The guy hasn't been<br> to a baseball game since 1958.<br> So, in order to ease his pain, you're<br> supposed to take him to a ballgame.<br> Yes.<br> Ray, this is nuttier than<br> building the baseball field.<br> No. No, it's not.<br> It's pretty weird, but building<br> the field was 5, 10% weirder.<br> I'm going to have<br> to nip this one in the bud.<br> We're having moderate-to-heavy<br> financial difficulties here.<br> And you can't take off for Boston<br> while we're going broke in lowa.<br> This is really<br> new territory for us,<br> but we're dealing<br> with primal forces of nature.<br> The prudent thing is not<br> to quibble over details.<br> Yeah, but why do you have to go? Why<br> can't the voice send somebody else?<br> How about Shirley MacLaine?<br> Is she too busy?<br> What does this have<br> to do with you?<br> That's what I have<br> to find out.<br> Ray, we are behind on the mortgage.<br> That field ate up all of our savings.<br> We could lose this farm.<br> I won't even stay in motels. I'll<br> sleep in the car. I'll beg for food.<br> No. No! Now, this is too much!<br> Now, look. I understand your need to<br> prove to yourself and to the world<br> you are not turning into your<br> father, but you've done it.<br> You believed in the magic. It happened.<br> Isn't that enough?<br> It's more than that.<br> I know this is totally nuts,<br> but there's another reason<br> I'm supposed to do it.<br> I feel it as strongly<br> as I've felt anything.<br> There's a reason.<br> What? Just tell me what it is.<br> Something's going to happen<br> at the game.<br> There's something<br> at Fenway Park.<br> I got to be there with<br> Terence Mann to find it out.<br> Is Fenway the one with the big<br> green wall in left field?<br> Yeah.<br> I dreamt last night you were<br> at Fenway with Terence Mann.<br> Was I sitting on the<br> first base side? Yes.<br> About halfway up on the aisle?<br> Yeah. Eating a hot dog.<br> Eating a hot dog.<br> I had the same dream.<br> I'll help you pack.<br> Hi, I'm...<br> Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.<br> Hi. No.<br> Hi.<br> Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella. It's a great<br> pleasure to finally get to...<br> Hi, I'm Ray Kinsella.<br> I'm a big fan of yours.<br> Hi.<br> How do you do, Mr. Mann?<br> I have to take you<br> to a base...<br> All right, stupid, put your<br> hands up and get in the trunk.<br> Good. Good.<br> He lives right around here.<br> Do you know him?<br> He's sort of a tall black man.<br> I'm a friend of his.<br> If he was much of a friend, he could<br> give you the directions himself.<br> That's a good point.<br> Thank you.<br> I don't know where he lives.<br> Get away from me!<br> I ain't going<br> to tell you nothing.<br> Go away! You're a pest!<br> Two blocks down,<br> right-hand side.<br> First door that don't have a<br> chicken in the window is his.<br> No chicken.<br> Who the hell are you?<br> Sir, my name's Ray Kinsella.<br> We got<br> a learning disability here?<br> If I could just have<br> one minute, please.<br> Look, I can't tell you<br> the secret of life,<br> and I don't have<br> any answers for you.<br> I don't give interviews, and<br> I'm no longer a public figure.<br> I just want to be left alone,<br> so piss off.<br> Wait! Wait!<br> Look, I've come 1,500 miles<br> to see you<br> at the risk of losing my home<br> and alienating my wife.<br> All I'm asking is one minute.<br> Please.<br> One minute.<br> Okay, I understand<br> your desire for privacy,<br> and I wouldn't dream of intruding if<br> this weren't extremely important.<br> Oh, God.<br> I don't do causes anymore.<br> This isn't a cause.<br> I don't need money<br> or an endorsement.<br> Refreshing.<br> You once wrote,<br> "There comes a time when all the cosmic<br> tumblers have clicked into place<br> "and the universe opens<br> itself up for a few seconds<br> "to show you what's possible."<br> Oh, my God!<br> What?<br> You're from the '60s.<br> Well, yeah. Actually...<br> Out!<br> Hey!<br> Back to the '60s.<br> No place for you here in the future.<br> Get back while you still can!<br> You've changed, you know that?<br> Yes, I suppose I have.<br> How about this? Peace, love, dope.<br> Now get the hell out of here!<br> You've really pissed me off.<br> Hold it.<br> I was hoping I wouldn't have<br> to do it this way.<br> What the hell is that?<br> It's a gun.<br> It's your finger.<br> No, it's a gun.<br> Let me see it.<br> I'm not going to show you<br> my gun.<br> I'm not going to hurt you.<br> I need you to come with...<br> What are you doing?<br> I'll beat you with a crowbar<br> until you go away.<br> Whoa! Wait! You can't do that.<br> There are rules here? Oh, no.<br> There are no rules here.<br> You're a pacifist!<br> Shit.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> So what? You kidnapping me?<br> What's the deal here?<br> I was...<br> I was hoping I could just<br> convince you to come with me.<br> So you are kidnapping me?<br> I have to take you<br> to a baseball game.<br> You what?<br> Tonight's game. Red Sox, A's.<br> Why?<br> Something will happen there.<br> I don't know what, but we'll<br> find out when it does.<br> My name's Ray Kinsella.<br> You used my father's name for a<br> character in one of your stories.<br> John Kinsella.<br> You're seeing a whole team<br> of psychiatrists, aren't you?<br> I don't blame you for thinking<br> that, but, no, I'm not.<br> I swear to God, I'm the least<br> crazy person I've ever known.<br> Why are you kidnapping me<br> to a baseball game?<br> May I...<br> Oh, please.<br> Want a cup of coffee?<br> No.<br> Want some cookies?<br> No.<br> I read an interview you gave<br> a long time ago<br> about how you always dreamed<br> of playing at Ebbets Field<br> and how sad you felt<br> when they tore it down.<br> I never said that.<br> You didn't?<br> I don't even recall<br> thinking that.<br> This is so weird.<br> This whole...<br> This whole thing is so weird.<br> Then why go through with it?<br> It's a long story.<br> But it's a really good story.<br> I'll tell you on the way.<br> I'm not going to get rid<br> of you, am I?<br> Come to this game. I'll never<br> bother you again, not even...<br> Not even a Christmas card.<br> So what do you do<br> with yourself these days?<br> I live, I work.<br> I learned how to cook.<br> I take walks<br> and watch sunsets.<br> Don't you miss being involved?<br> I was the East Coast<br> distributor of involved.<br> I ate it and drank it<br> and breathed it.<br> Then they killed<br> Martin and Bobby,<br> they elected<br> Tricky Dick twice,<br> and now people like you think<br> I must be miserable because<br> I'm not involved anymore.<br> I've got news for you.<br> I spent all my misery<br> years ago.<br> I have no more pain left<br> for any of you.<br> I gave at the office.<br> So what do you want?<br> I want them to stop<br> looking to me for answers,<br> begging me to speak again,<br> write again, be a leader.<br> I want them to start thinking<br> for themselves.<br> I want my privacy.<br> No, I meant what do you want?<br> Oh.<br> Dog and a beer.<br> Two.<br> Okay, I understand.<br> You should be entitled to<br> as much privacy as you want,<br> but why stop writing?<br> I haven't published a word<br> in 17 years,<br> and still I have to endure<br> lunatics like you.<br> What do you think would happen if I<br> suddenly came out with a new book?<br> They'd bleed me dry.<br> Go the distance.<br> Go the distance.<br> What's the matter?<br> You didn't see that?<br> See what?<br> I'm sorry. I guess<br> you didn't have to be here.<br> What?<br> Whenever you want to go,<br> we can go.<br> Fine. Let's go.<br> What is it<br> you're not telling me?<br> I've already taken up<br> too much of your time.<br> I wish I had<br> your passion, Ray.<br> Misdirected though it might<br> be, it is still a passion.<br> I used to feel that way<br> about things, but...<br> You got another message,<br> didn't you?<br> You'll think I'm crazy.<br> I already think you're crazy.<br> What did it say?<br> It said, "The man's done enough.<br> Leave him alone."<br> "Moonlight" Graham.<br> You saw it.<br> Saw what?<br> You saw it.<br> New York Giants, 1922.<br> He played one game.<br> He never got to bat.<br> What did I see?<br> Chisholm, Minnesota.<br> We were the only ones who saw it.<br> Did you hear the voice, too?<br> It's what told me to find you.<br> Did you hear it?<br> "Go the distance"?<br> Yes.<br> Do you know what it means?<br> Yes.<br> What?<br> It means we're going to Minnesota<br> to find "Moonlight" Graham.<br> We're going... We?<br> I must be out of my mind.<br> What do we do<br> when we find him?<br> How the hell<br> am I supposed to know?<br> That's right.<br> You're right. You're right.<br> This is so bitching.<br> I don't believe<br> I'm doing this.<br> Hey, Annie, guess what?<br> I'm with Terence Mann.<br> Oh, my God.<br> You kidnapped him.<br> No, I didn't. He wanted to.<br> Sorry, but I'm going<br> to be a few days longer.<br> We're going to Minnesota.<br> I don't believe this.<br> What's in Minnesota?<br> An old ballplayer.<br> I'll explain when I get home.<br> How are things with you?<br> Fine.<br> Great. Look, Ann,<br> I got to go, okay?<br> Give Karin a hug for me,<br> and I love you.<br> I love you, too.<br> Hey, someday explain all this<br> to me, okay?<br> I'll try.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Bye.<br> Why didn't you tell him?<br> Annie, you got no choice<br> in the matter.<br> Half a dozen Grahams.<br> No Archibald. No "Moonlight."<br> Follow me.<br> Hello.<br> Excuse me.<br> Maybe you can help us.<br> We're looking for an ex-baseball<br> player named Archibald Graham.<br> Oh, you mean Doc Graham.<br> No. I think<br> his nickname was "Moonlight."<br> Well, that's Dr. Graham.<br> Dr. Graham?<br> His baseball career<br> never amounted to much.<br> He went back to school.<br> His father was a doctor.<br> Do you know<br> where we can find him?<br> It's nothing bad.<br> We're not from the IRS.<br> Doc Graham is dead.<br> He died in 1972.<br> "And there were times<br> when children could not afford<br> "eyeglasses or milk<br> or clothing.<br> "Yet, no child was ever denied<br> these essentials<br> "because, in the background,<br> there was always Dr. Graham.<br> "Without any fanfare<br> or publicity,<br> "the glasses or the milk<br> or the ticket to the ballgame<br> "found their way<br> into the child's pocket."<br> You wrote that.<br> The day he died.<br> Can I see that?<br> You're a good writer.<br> So are you.<br> Something's missing.<br> Well, he sounds like<br> he was a wonderful man.<br> Half the towns in North<br> America have a Doc Graham.<br> What makes this one so special we<br> travel across the country to find him<br> There's got to be more.<br> What else?<br> He always wore an overcoat,<br> he had white hair,<br> and he always carried<br> an umbrella.<br> What was the umbrella for?<br> It got to be a habit,<br> something to hang on to.<br> He said he used it to beat<br> away his lady admirers.<br> Tell me about his wife.<br> Alicia.<br> She moved to South Carolina<br> after Doc passed.<br> She passed<br> a couple years later.<br> She always wore blue.<br> The shopkeepers in town<br> would stock blue hats<br> because they knew if Doc<br> walked by, he'd buy one.<br> When they cleaned out<br> his office,<br> they found boxes of blue hats<br> that he never got around<br> to give her.<br> I'll bet you didn't know that.<br> No, I didn't.<br> No screwing, no drinking, no<br> opium, no midnight abortions,<br> no illegitimate children,<br> no shady finances.<br> You sound disappointed.<br> Shoeless Joe had a problem.<br> That's why he needed you.<br> This guy doesn't need us.<br> Terence.<br> Do you know you're missing?<br> Oh, God.<br> "His father,<br> who lives in Baltimore,<br> "notified police after receiving no<br> answer to repeated telephone calls."<br> Shoot.<br> I better call him.<br> You want me to...<br> Thanks.<br> I'm taking a walk.<br> Be back in a while.<br> What do I tell him?<br> "This year's"?<br> Dr. Graham?<br> My name's Ray Kinsella.<br> I'm from lowa.<br> Are you "Moonlight" Graham?<br> No one's called me "Moonlight"<br> Graham in 50 years.<br> Well, I've come<br> a very long way to see you.<br> I couldn't sleep tonight.<br> Usually I sleep like a baby.<br> I told Alicia<br> I was taking a walk.<br> Do you mind if I join you?<br> I'd like to talk to you.<br> Let's walk over to my office.<br> What do you want<br> to talk to me about?<br> When you got to the majors, you<br> played only one inning of one game.<br> What happened that inning?<br> It was the last day<br> of the season,<br> bottom of the eighth,<br> we were way ahead.<br> In three weeks,<br> I hadn't seen any action.<br> Suddenly old John McGraw points<br> a bony finger in my direction<br> and he says, "Right field."<br> I jumped up like I was sitting<br> on a spring,<br> grabbed my glove,<br> and ran out on the field.<br> Did you get to make<br> a play?<br> They never hit the ball<br> out of the infield.<br> The game ended.<br> The season was over.<br> I knew they'd send me<br> back down.<br> I couldn't bear the thought<br> of another year in the minors.<br> So I decided to hang them up.<br> Go on. Sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> So what was that like?<br> It was like coming<br> this close to your dreams,<br> then watch them brush past you,<br> like a stranger in a crowd.<br> Then, you don't think<br> about it.<br> We just don't recognize life's<br> most significant moments<br> while they're happening.<br> Back then I thought, "Well,<br> there'll be other days."<br> I didn't realize that<br> that was the only day.<br> And now,<br> I want to ask you a question.<br> What's so interesting about half an<br> inning that you'd come from lowa<br> to talk to me about it<br> I didn't really know<br> till just now,<br> but I think it's to ask you if you<br> could do anything you wanted,<br> if you could have a wish...<br> And you're the kind of a man<br> who could grant me that wish?<br> I don't know. I'm just asking.<br> Well, you know,<br> I never got to bat<br> in the major leagues.<br> I'd have liked to have had<br> that chance, just once,<br> to stare down<br> a big-league pitcher.<br> Then just as he goes<br> into his windup, wink.<br> Make him think<br> you know something he doesn't.<br> That's what I wish for.<br> The chance to squint at a sky so blue<br> it hurts your eyes to look at it,<br> to feel the tingle in your arms<br> as you connect with the ball,<br> run bases, stretching a double into a<br> triple and flop face first into third,<br> wrap your arms around the bag.<br> That's my wish.<br> That's my wish.<br> Is there enough magic<br> out there in the moonlight<br> to make this dream come true?<br> What would you say<br> if I said yes?<br> I think<br> I'd actually believe you.<br> There's a place where<br> things like that happen.<br> If you want to go,<br> I can take you.<br> This is my most special place<br> in all the world.<br> Once a place touches you like this,<br> the wind never blows so cold again.<br> You feel for it,<br> like it was your child.<br> I can't leave Chisholm.<br> I understand. I do.<br> But I really think you're<br> supposed to come with us.<br> No.<br> But your wish?<br> It'll have to stay a wish.<br> I was born here, I lived here,<br> I'll die here, but no regrets.<br> Fifty years ago, for 5 minutes<br> you came this close.<br> It would kill some men<br> to get that close to their<br> dream and not touch it.<br> God. They'd consider it<br> a tragedy.<br> If I'd only gotten to be<br> a doctor for five minutes,<br> now that would have been<br> a tragedy.<br> I better be getting home. Alicia<br> will think I got a girlfriend.<br> And he smiled.<br> And then I figured, maybe we're<br> not supposed to take him with us.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't know why in the hell<br> we were supposed to come here.<br> Maybe it's to find out if one<br> inning can change the world.<br> Think it did?<br> Did for these people.<br> If he'd gotten a hit, he might<br> have stayed in baseball.<br> I don't know.<br> Oh, your wife called. She wants<br> you to call her tonight.<br> Ray?<br> I'm fine.<br> I'm just so glad it's you.<br> Listen, I talked to the bank,<br> and I asked them if we could<br> miss a payment or two,<br> and they told me that they had<br> just sold the note on the farm<br> to Mark and his partners.<br> Right.<br> So they own the paper now.<br> He says if we don't sell to them,<br> they're going to foreclose.<br> Ray, we don't have the money.<br> Look, I've got to take<br> Mr. Mann back to Boston first.<br> Okay? So, it's...<br> No.<br> Wait a second.<br> I'm going to lowa with you.<br> We're coming home.<br> Hell, I can't quit now.<br> I got to see this ballpark.<br> Not everyone can see it.<br> You might not.<br> Give it a try.<br> I need all the karma<br> I can get right now.<br> Thanks.<br> You're the first car by.<br> How far you going?<br> Iowa.<br> If it's okay, I'll just ride along a while.<br> I play baseball.<br> Hop in.<br> All right.<br> I'm looking<br> for a place to play.<br> I heard that all through the<br> Midwest, they have towns with teams.<br> In some places,<br> they'll find you a day job<br> so you can play ball<br> nights and weekends.<br> It's your lucky day. We're going<br> someplace kind of like that.<br> All right.<br> I'm Ray Kinsella.<br> This is Terence Mann.<br> Hi.<br> I'm Archie Graham.<br> It's funny the way he described<br> towns finding you a job<br> so you could play<br> on their team.<br> They haven't done that<br> for years.<br> Dad did that for a while,<br> but that was in the '20s.<br> What happened to your father?<br> He never made it as a ballplayer. He<br> wanted his son to make it for him.<br> By 10, playing baseball got to be like<br> eating vegetables or taking out garbage.<br> When I was 14,<br> I started to refuse.<br> Can you believe that?<br> American boy refusing to have<br> a catch with his father?<br> Why 14?<br> That's when I read The Boat<br> Rocker by Terence Mann.<br> Oh, God.<br> I never played catch<br> with him again.<br> That's the crap<br> people always lay on me.<br> It's not my fault you wouldn't<br> play catch with him.<br> I know.<br> Anyway, when I was 17,<br> I packed my things, said<br> something awful, and left.<br> After a while, I wanted to come<br> home, but I didn't know how.<br> Made it back<br> for the funeral, though.<br> What was the awful thing<br> you said?<br> To your father?<br> Oh.<br> I said I could never respect a<br> man whose hero was a criminal.<br> Who was his hero?<br> Shoeless Joe Jackson.<br> You knew he wasn't a criminal.<br> Then why did you say it?<br> I was 17.<br> The son of a bitch died<br> before I could take it back.<br> Before I could tell him,<br> you know.<br> He never met my wife.<br> He never saw<br> his granddaughter.<br> This is your penance.<br> I know.<br> I can't bring my father back.<br> So the least you can do<br> is bring back his hero.<br> Well...<br> Now I know what<br> everybody's purpose here is,<br> except mine.<br> Hey.<br> Daddy!<br> Karin, come here.<br> Hi!<br> Oh, we missed you.<br> Are you, okay?<br> Yeah. This is Terence Mann.<br> Terry.<br> Welcome.<br> Hi, Terry.<br> And this young fella<br> is...This is Archie Graham.<br> Archie.<br> He's come to practice<br> with the team.<br> He'll be able to do<br> a lot more than that.<br> What does that mean?<br> What do you say?<br> What do you say?<br> Hey, Ray. Welcome back.<br> Thanks, Joe.<br> Oh, my God.<br> What?<br> That's Shoeless Joe Jackson.<br> Of course it is.<br> You didn't believe me?<br> I thought I did, but...<br> Oh, my God.<br> Hi, Annie.<br> Hi, Joe.<br> Good to see you.<br> Terry, I'd like you<br> to meet Shoeless Joe Jackson.<br> Joe, Terry Mann.<br> It's a pleasure meeting you.<br> The pleasure's mine.<br> We got tired<br> of just having practices,<br> so we brought another team out<br> so we'd have some real games.<br> I don't mind.<br> Where'd they come from?<br> Where did we come from?<br> So many wanted to play here. We had<br> to beat them off with a stick.<br> Hey, that's Smokey Joe Wood<br> and Mel Ott<br> and Gil Hodges.<br> Ty Cobb wanted to play.<br> Nobody could stand him<br> when we were alive.<br> We told him to stick it.<br> Hey, are you Graham?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Why are you on the sidelines?<br> Came to play ball, didn't you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> All right.

Hang in there!<br> Knuckles, what did you throw<br> at the kid for?<br> He winked at me.<br> Don't wink, kid.<br> Good thing for you<br> he didn't throw the fastball.<br> Let's see that fastball.<br> Let's go. Come on.<br> - Yeah!<br> - Ball.<br> Hey, ump! Come on.<br> Give us a break!<br> Hey, ump.<br> How about a warning?<br> Sure.<br> Watch out<br> you don't get killed.<br> Time!<br> Those first two were<br> high and tight.<br> What will the next one be?<br> Well, either low and away<br> or in my ear.<br> He won't want to load the bases.<br> So look for low and away.<br> All right.<br> But watch out for in your ear.<br> - Come on, Archie!<br> - Let's go, kid!<br> Batter, batter,<br> batter, batter!<br> Come on, Arch.<br> It just takes one.<br> Never hit it, kid.<br> Yeah.

Way to go.<br> What is this?<br> What is this jerk doing?<br> Hi!<br> Shit!<br> Wreck him.<br> Let me at him!<br> You're interrupting<br> the game, Mark.<br> Ray, it's time to put away<br> your little fantasies<br> and come down to Earth.<br> It's not a fantasy.<br> They're real.<br> Who is real?<br> Shoeless Joe Jackson,<br> the White Sox, all of them.<br> You mean?<br> He can't see any of them.<br> Well, who is this, Elvis?<br> Ray.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> it's Terence Mann.<br> How do you do?<br> I'm the Easter bunny.<br> Let's settle this thing now.<br> You have no money.<br> Look. I'm not selling.<br> You have no money!<br> You have a stack of bills! Come<br> fall, you got no crop to sell.<br> I have a deal that allows you<br> to stay on the land.<br> We don't have<br> to sell the farm.<br> You'll live<br> in the house rent-free.<br> What about the team?<br> Do you realize<br> how much this land is worth?<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> We can't keep a useless baseball<br> diamond in rich farmland.<br> Read my lips. We're staying, all right?<br> We're staying.<br> Ray, you're bankrupt!<br> I'm offering you a way to keep your<br> home because I love my sister.<br> My partners don't care<br> and are ready to foreclose.<br> Daddy, we don't have<br> to sell the farm.<br> Karin, please!<br> Just wait!<br> Wait!<br> People will come.<br> What people, sweetheart?<br> From all over.<br> They'll just decide<br> to take a vacation, see?<br> And they'll come to lowa City.<br> They'll think it's really boring.<br> So they'll want to pay us.<br> Like buying a ticket.<br> You're not seriously listening<br> to this, are you?<br> Yes.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Why would anybody pay money<br> to come here?<br> To watch the games.<br> It will be just like when they<br> were little kids a long time ago.<br> They'll watch the game<br> and remember what it was like.<br> What the hell<br> is she talking about?<br> People will come.<br> All right.<br> This is fascinating,<br> but you don't have the money to<br> bring the mortgage up to date.<br> You're still going<br> to have to sell.<br> I'm sorry, Ray.<br> We got no choice.<br> Ray.<br> People will come, Ray.<br> They'll come to lowa for reasons<br> they can't even fathom.<br> They'll turn up your driveway, not<br> knowing for sure why they're doing it.<br> They'll arrive at your door<br> as innocent as children,<br> longing for the past.<br> "Of course, we won't mind if<br> you look around," you'll say.<br> "It's only $20 per person."<br> They'll pass over the money<br> without even thinking about it.<br> For it is money they have<br> and peace they lack.<br> Just sign the papers.<br> Then they'll walk out<br> to the bleachers<br> and sit in their shirt sleeves<br> on a perfect afternoon.<br> They'll find<br> they have reserved seats<br> somewhere along<br> one of the baselines,<br> where they sat<br> when they were children<br> and cheered their heroes,<br> and they'll watch the game,<br> and it will be as if they dipped<br> themselves in magic waters.<br> The memories will be so thick,<br> they'll have to brush them<br> away from their faces.<br> Ray, when the bank opens in the<br> morning, they'll foreclose.<br> People will come, Ray.<br> You're broke, Ray. You sell<br> now, or you lose everything.<br> The one constant through all the<br> years, Ray, has been baseball.<br> America has rolled by<br> like an army of steamrollers.<br> It's been erased like a blackboard,<br> rebuilt, and erased again.<br> But baseball has marked<br> the time.<br> This field, this game.<br> It's a part of our past, Ray.<br> It reminds us of all<br> that once was good,<br> and it could be again.<br> Oh, people will come, Ray.<br> People will<br> most definitely come.<br> Ray,<br> you will lose everything.<br> You will be evicted.<br> Come on, Ray.<br> I'm not signing.<br> You're crazy. Absolutely nuts!<br> I can't do it, pal.<br> I mean,<br> you build a baseball field<br> in the middle of nowhere,<br> and you stare at nothing.<br> It's not nothing. Your daughter's<br> turned into a space case.<br> Get your hands off her!<br> Karin?<br> Is she all right?<br> Is she breathing?<br> Should I get the car?<br> I'm going to call Emergency.<br> Annie, wait.<br> What?<br> Just wait.<br> What have we got here?<br> She fell.<br> This child's choking<br> to death. Get her up.<br> Hold her steady now.<br> Hot dog. Stuck in her throat.<br> She'll be all right.<br> She'll be turning handsprings<br> before you know it.<br> Thank you, Doc.<br> No, son.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, my God. You can't go back.<br> Hey, it's all right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's all right.<br> I best be getting on home<br> before Alicia begins to think<br> I got a girlfriend.<br> Hey, Doc.<br> Good work, Doc.<br> Nice going, Doc.<br> Going to miss you, Doc.<br> Win one for me one day,<br> will you, boys?<br> Okay, Doc.<br> Yeah.<br> When did these ballplayers<br> get here?<br> Hey, rookie!<br> You were good.<br> Do not sell this farm, Ray.<br> You got to keep this farm.<br> You've had a rough day. Go inside<br> and get something cold to drink.<br> Yeah. That's a good idea.<br> Don't sell the farm, Ray.<br> Ray?<br> We're going to call it a day.<br> See you tomorrow.<br> Okay.<br> Hey, do you want<br> to come with us?<br> You mean it?<br> No, not you.<br> Him.<br> Him?<br> Come with you?<br> Out there.<br> What is out there?<br> Come and find out.<br> Wait a second. Why him?<br> I built this field. You wouldn't<br> be here if it weren't for me.<br> Ray, I'm unattached.<br> You have a family.<br> I want to know<br> what's out there.<br> But you're not invited.<br> Not invited? What do you mean<br> I'm not invited?<br> That's my corn out there. You<br> guys are guests in my corn.<br> I've done everything<br> I've been asked to do.<br> I didn't understand it,<br> but I've done it.<br> I haven't once asked<br> what's in it for me.<br> What are you saying?<br> I'm saying,<br> "What's in it for me?"<br> Is that why you did this?<br> For you?<br> I think you'd better<br> stay here, Ray.<br> Why?<br> There's a reason<br> they chose me,<br> just as there's a reason<br> they chose this field.<br> I gave that interview.<br> What interview?<br> What are you talking about?<br> The one about Ebbets Field, the one<br> that sent you to Boston to find me.<br> You lied to me.<br> You were kidnapping me at the time.<br> You lied.<br> You said<br> your finger was a gun.<br> That's a good point.<br> Ray.<br> Listen to me, Ray.<br> Listen to me.<br> There is something out there,<br> and if I have the courage<br> to go through with this,<br> what a story it'll make.<br> "Shoeless Joe Jackson comes<br> to lowa."<br> What? Are you going<br> to write about it?<br> You bet I'll write about it.<br> You're going to write<br> about it.<br> That's what I do.<br> Good.<br> Honey?<br> Honey, where's he going?<br> Terry's been invited<br> to go out with the others.<br> How are you feeling,<br> sweetheart?<br> Stupid.<br> You mean out?<br> Yeah.<br> Out.<br> Far out.<br> I want a full description.<br> Take care of this family.<br> Be careful.<br> Bye.<br> What?<br> What are you grinning at,<br> you ghost?<br> "If you build it,<br> "he will come."<br> Oh, my God.<br> What? What is it?<br> It's my father.<br> "Ease his pain."<br> "Go the distance."<br> it was you.<br> No, Ray.<br> It was you.<br> My God. I...<br> I only saw him years later<br> when he was worn down by life.<br> Look at him.<br> He's got his whole life in front of him,<br> and I'm not even a glint in his eye.<br> What do I say to him?<br> Why don't you introduce<br> him to his granddaughter?<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> I just wanted to thank you folks<br> for putting up this field,<br> letting us play here.<br> I'm John Kinsella.<br> I'm Ray.<br> My wife Annie.<br> Hi.<br> This is my daughter Karin.<br> Karin, this is my...<br> This is John.<br> Hi, John.<br> Hiya, Karin.<br> Well, we're going to let<br> you two talk.<br> I mean, if all these people<br> are going to come,<br> we got a lot of work to do.<br> It was very nice meeting you.<br> Ma'am.<br> Come on, hon.<br> You catch a good game.<br> Thank you.<br> It's so beautiful here.<br> For me...<br> Well, for me it's like<br> a dream come true.<br> Can I ask you something?<br> Is...
