                        - Lights up !<br> - Beginners, please !<br> - Your five-minute call, sir.<br> - Places.<br> - Places. Everyone to their places.<br> Sh. Quiet, everyone.<br> Opening nights ?<br> I love opening nights.<br> - How are you ? Good to see you.<br> - Good evening, Charles.<br> - Sir Herbert, how are you ?<br> - This is my wife.<br> - Oh, Lady Herbert.<br> - How do you do ?<br> May I give you a peck ?<br> One of Mr Barrie's finest ?<br> Oh, that genius Scotsman<br> has done it again.<br> It's the best thing I've produced<br> in 25 years.<br> I already have investors interested<br> back home in New York.<br> See you on Broadway !<br> First positions, people.<br> Standing by, please,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> If you could take<br> your opening positions, please.<br> Beginners, please take<br> your opening positions.<br> Audience are coming in. Standing by.<br> - Good audience.<br> - Sorry ?<br> Good audience tonight.<br> OK. That's great, thank you.<br> How much longer ?<br> Um, ten minutes, sir.<br> I love opening nights.<br> I want to dance with your wife<br> at the after-party.<br> - Oh, my goodness.<br> - Good evening, Mr Frohman.<br> - How are you, John ?<br> - Very well.<br> It's the best thing<br> that I've produced in 25 years.<br> - Hello, George. How are you ?<br> - Healthy and wealthy, I see.<br> You've rearranged a holiday<br> for me and I won't forget it.<br> - For you, Charles, anything.<br> - You won't regret it.<br> I'm sure.<br> - Have you got the tickets ?<br> - They're in my pocket.<br> - There's Mrs Barrie.<br> - Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.<br> We were so hoping to speak<br> with your husband before the show.<br> - Have you seen him ?<br> - I'm not sure where he is, actually.<br> We do miss seeing you on stage.<br> You were so wonderful.<br> Yes, well, it's been some time now.<br> Are you right to find your seat ?<br> Oh, yes, yes.<br> See you at the party, then.<br> Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie<br> and remind him that they're doing his play<br> this evening.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Thank you.<br> Let's close the doors.<br> Really, I mustn't<br> inconvenience you in this way.<br> I can wait quite well in the shop.<br> 'Tis no inconvenience.<br> The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.<br> Really, you are uncommonly good.<br> Sorry, sir.<br> Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you<br> that the play's begun.<br> - Though I imagine you know that.<br> - They hate it.<br> - Sir ?<br> - It's like a dentist's office out there. Why ?<br> - I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.<br> - What do you think ? Do you like it ?<br> - I've just been hired here, sir.<br> - Yes or no ? I'm not bothered.<br> - I'm not really qualified to...<br> - Do you like it ? Is it crap ?<br> - Crap, sir ?<br> - Go on, say it. Just say it.<br> It's shite, isn't it ? Go on. Say it.<br> - Don't know if I'm...<br> - "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.<br> - It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.<br> - I knew it.<br> - No, I haven't even seen it.<br> - I knew it. Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Might I knock a tune, milord,<br> for a moment ?<br> I'm an old man...<br> ..and I've seen few of the sights.<br> Absolute rubbish from start to finish.<br> Yes, I found it fearfully dull.<br> Say goodbye to your investment, old boy.<br> Good to see you. My apologies.<br> We'll get them with the next one,<br> Charles, I promise.<br> - Of course we will, James.<br> - I know you put a lot into this one.<br> A fortune, James, but I am fortunate<br> because I can afford to lose a fortune.<br> - Can you ?<br> - No, I can't. How are you ?<br> - Arthur.<br> - James.<br> You were sorely missed<br> at the last club meeting.<br> Was I ?<br> We were beginning to wonder<br> which is your hobby, writing or cricket.<br> You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,<br> didn't you ?<br> Oh yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,<br> should we ?<br> I don't see why not.<br> If you ask me, the problem<br> lies in our batting order.<br> - James.<br> - Hello, darling.<br> You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,<br> don't you ?<br> - Mrs Snow.<br> - Mr Barrie.<br> Mr Snow.<br> The Snows have been waiting<br> to meet with you all evening.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> - Is that right ?<br> Your play this evening,<br> it was remarkable, wasn't it ?<br> Was it ?<br> Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.<br> I'm glad you liked it.<br> How did you feel it went ?<br> - I think I can do better.<br> - Really ?<br> - Mary ? Hello ?<br> - Yes, James ?<br> I'm headed off for the park if you'd<br> like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.<br> You'll be working, won't you ?<br> Perhaps, yes.<br> I'll let you to your work then.<br> - Morning, Mr Barrie.<br> - Morning, Emma.<br> - Have a good day, sir.<br> - And you.<br> That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.<br> That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.<br> Who do you belong to ?<br> Come on, boy. Come on.<br> Excuse me, sir,<br> you're standing on my sleeve.<br> Am I ? So sorry.<br> I might point out<br> you're lying under my bench.<br> I have to, I'm afraid.<br> I've been put in a dungeon<br> by the evil Prince George.<br> I'm sorry if it bothers you.<br> Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,<br> there isn't much to be done now, is there ?<br> Perhaps I could slide a key to you<br> through the bars.<br> I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil<br> Prince George has tortured many men.<br> I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir ?<br> My brother can be<br> an extremely irritating sort of person.<br> Aha, Prince George, I gather.<br> I understand you are the horrible tyrant<br> who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.<br> I'm not horrible really, but a firm ruler, yes.<br> Kind and tolerant.<br> And what precisely is...<br> What did you say your name was ?<br> - Michael.<br> - What precisely is Michael's crime ?<br> - He's my younger brother.<br> - Ah.<br> - Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.<br> - That's all right.<br> - Do you mind us playing with your dog ?<br> - No. Go on.<br> This is Jack, second in line to the throne<br> and that one's Michael. He's only five.<br> And I'm in prison for it.<br> - I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you ?<br> - We're not bothering him, Mum.<br> Michael, darling,<br> come out from under there.<br> I can't. I'm in prison.<br> Oh, I see.<br> JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.<br> JM Barrie, the author ? A pleasure.<br> Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.<br> - Are you a writer ?<br> - I am.<br> He's a playwright, Jack.<br> Quite a famous one, at that.<br> - I apologize. I imagine you're writing.<br> - No. Not at all.<br> - Where's Peter ?<br> - What have you written, Mr Barrie ?<br> Well, currently, I make my living<br> entertaining princes and their courts<br> with my trained bear, Porthos.<br> If you command your brother,<br> Peter, to join us,<br> I am willing, Prince George,<br> to give you just such a performance<br> in exchange for the freedom<br> of this prisoner, of course.<br> - Very well.<br> - Very well.<br> Now...<br> I want you to pay particular attention<br> to the teeth.<br> Some unscrupulous trainers will show you<br> a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,<br> while other cowards<br> will force the brute into a muzzle.<br> Only the true master would attempt these<br> tricks without either measure of safety.<br> - What did you bring me over here for ?<br> - Peter.<br> This is absurd. It's just a dog.<br> Come on, darling.<br> "Just a dog" ? "Just" ?<br> Porthos, don't listen to him.<br> Porthos dreams of being a bear<br> and you want to dash those dreams<br> by saying he's "just a dog" ?<br> What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.<br> That's like saying, "He can't climb<br> that mountain, he's just a man."<br> Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."<br> "Just."<br> Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.<br> Peter, where are your manners ?<br> With those eyes, my bonny lad,<br> I'm afraid you'd never see it.<br> However, with just a wee bit of imagination,<br> I can turn around right now and see...<br> the great bear, Porthos.<br> Dance with me.<br> Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen<br> a performance quite like it.<br> We're here every day, and the bear<br> is always more than happy to perform.<br> Well, perhaps we'll see you here<br> tomorrow then.<br> Perhaps.<br> - Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.<br> - Bye.<br> Bye.<br> - Peter, didn't you enjoy that ?<br> - I've seen better.<br> Well, Michael wanted the bear<br> kept prisoner with him,<br> and Peter insisted<br> that Michael was hardly a prisoner<br> and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.<br> I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.<br> - What's her name ?<br> - Sylvia. Um...<br> Mrs... something Davies.<br> Llewelyn Davies ?<br> - You know her ?<br> - I know who she is, of course.<br> Why, she's a du Maurier,<br> for heaven's sake.<br> Her father was the artist.<br> Her brother's the actor.<br> And there was something... tragic<br> that happened with her husband.<br> Oh, yes. He died.<br> Cancer of the jaw, I believe.<br> That's horrible.<br> Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys<br> and no income to speak of.<br> If it wasn't for her mother's help...<br> James.<br> - We should have them to dinner.<br> - Should we ?<br> Absolutely. I've always wanted<br> to meet Madam du Maurier.<br> Why, she knows practically<br> everyone there is worth knowing.<br> - What are you writing about ?<br> - Oh.<br> Nothing of any great consequence.<br> I can't write.<br> Have you ever kept a journal ?<br> Ever tried your hand at writing a play ?<br> Well, then how do you know ?<br> I know. That's all.<br> I see. Where's your mother today<br> and the rest of the boys ?<br> Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.<br> I'm sure everyone would be happy<br> to see you though. One afternoon.<br> I should leave you to your writing.<br> Peter.<br> I'll see you later then.<br> Why didn't you tell me, Charles ?<br> You knew it wasn't any good.<br> Why didn't you tell me. James ?<br> You knew it wasn't any good. Hm ?<br> I took an extended lease on the theater,<br> keeping the actors on.<br> - I don't have another play.<br> - I'm sure you will.<br> - Won't you ?<br> - We'll see.<br> I need you to sign for the storage,<br> Mr Frohman.<br> - Lower.<br> - Easy does it. Take your time.<br> It was never meant to be taken seriously.<br> You know what happened, James ?<br> They changed it.<br> - They changed what ?<br> - The critics.<br> They made it important.<br> Hm ?<br> What's it called ?<br> What's it called ?<br> - "Play."<br> - "Play."<br> Bang, bang, bang !<br> Bang !<br> Return the boy to us, you nasty lnjun.<br> Our people teach boy lndian ways,<br> make him great warrior.<br> Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.<br> Bang, bang, bang !<br> Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.<br> You go. Spread wings<br> and soar like eagle above enemy.<br> Fly back to our chief.<br> Tell her of my brave defeat.<br> That's crazy. Indians can't fly.<br> Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.<br> Listen to us, boy.<br> This lnjun kidnapped you.<br> Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.<br> I teach you ways of the brave.<br> I take you as my own son.<br> You are not my father.<br> Bang, bang, bang, bang !<br> - I've got him !<br> - Let me go !<br> - Stop it, you two.<br> - Ooh, we are awful, aren't we ?<br> - I'm warning you.<br> - Oh, I'm scared.<br> Of course, you had a bit of fun<br> for a change.<br> - Stop it, you two. Get off !<br> - Don't.<br> - Jack !<br> - Stop it !<br> - Get off, George !<br> - Peter.<br> - I'm terribly sorry.<br> - No, it wasn't your fault.<br> I'm afraid it might have been.<br> To be honest, I'm just happy you got him<br> to join in the game.<br> Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.<br> Mr Barrie, it's more<br> than I've been able to achieve.<br> Peter's a different boy since his father died.<br> You know, I don't think<br> he's even had a good cry about it.<br> Well, grief affects us all in different ways,<br> doesn't it ?<br> Yes, it does.<br> Oh, by the way, my wife would like<br> to invite you and the boys over to dinner.<br> Your mother as well.<br> Oh.<br> How kind. That would be lovely.<br> Well...<br> Don't you all look lovely in your little suits ?<br> And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is<br> that we've not met until this evening.<br> How kind of you to say so.<br> Not at all. I can't tell you how many times<br> I've been to a charity or a social event<br> and seen your name listed<br> among the organizers.<br> It's the very thing I would love to do myself<br> if I could just find the time.<br> My problem is in finding the time<br> to do everything else.<br> At the moment I am running<br> two households.<br> Sylvia believes she can get by<br> without a housekeeper.<br> Mother.<br> My house is quite large enough for us all,<br> - but the idea of living with me seems...<br> - Not now, please, mother.<br> - We help her keep the house in order.<br> - Don't interrupt, George.<br> - Where did you get your manners ?<br> - Sorry, Grandmother.<br> Mr Barrie, I understand you've become<br> playmates of my grandchildren.<br> - Oh, they indulge me, really.<br> - On the contrary.<br> The other day we took to an exploration<br> of darkest Africa in our garden.<br> But Mr Barrie was taken ill<br> by the bite of a... What was it ?<br> Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.<br> Yes, and he swelled to the size<br> of a hippopotamus.<br> Fingers like sausages.<br> And we had to float in him down the river<br> like he was a great bloated raft.<br> But the fishing was good, wasn't it ?<br> James.<br> Please.<br> - Bye.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> - Lovely evening.<br> - Thank you. Bye.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Well, that was a disaster.<br> Painful.<br> Utterly painful to see.<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> I had a lovely time.<br> Oh, James, please.<br> "My problem is in finding<br> the time to do everything else."<br> - I never felt so judged in my life.<br> - Judged ? How do you mean ?<br> A grown man, for heaven's sake,<br> playing all day long with children ?<br> In any case, I hardly think they'll be<br> the social contact we'd hoped for.<br> I hadn't really thought of them that way.<br> I just enjoy their company.<br> He's been a good friend to us, Mother.<br> Yes. But what does that mean ? Hm ?<br> Surely you don't intend...<br> ..to keep spending your afternoons<br> with those children, do you ?<br> And so today, ladies and gentlemen,<br> using only the wind<br> and his own physical strength,<br> George Llewelyn Davies shall test<br> the very limits of the atmosphere<br> using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.<br> - Go on, George.<br> - You're going to break it, George.<br> - George, stop !<br> - I just need a bit more speed.<br> I want to do it.<br> Hold off a bit, George.<br> I think it's in need of a tail.<br> Oh, wait.<br> - Here. James, this will do.<br> - That's a good idea.<br> - No, it's not heavy enough.<br> - I want to do it.<br> - You coming, Peter ?<br> - Porthos !<br> It'll work this time.<br> Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.<br> - Michael ?<br> - Yeah ?<br> - Now, would you like to give it a go ?<br> - Yes, please.<br> - Oh, he can't run fast enough.<br> - Of course he can.<br> - Let him try, Jack.<br> - Now, George, you hold the kite.<br> George.<br> Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.<br> Come on, Peter.<br> Right, George, hold it up. Darling,<br> you've got to run now. Ready ? Ready ?<br> - Run ! Run, Michael !<br> - Run !<br> Oh.<br> - Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.<br> - I don't think he's fast enough.<br> It's not going to work<br> if no one believes in him.<br> - Now, give him a chance.<br> - Michael, go back to your starting position.<br> - Come on, darling, try again.<br> - George, you take the kite.<br> Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath<br> of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.<br> Right. Look, I think I feel a bit<br> more breeze. Are you ready, Michael ?<br> - You can do it, Michael.<br> - You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.<br> - Run !<br> - That's it !<br> Yes ! He did it !<br> Keep running ! Keep running !<br> What are you writing about now ?<br> Oh, just making notes.<br> I'm never really certain what they're about<br> until I've read them over later.<br> Something about the kite ?<br> Now, why do you ask that ?<br> I don't know.<br> If I were a writer I think I could tell<br> a whole story about flying the kite today.<br> Perhaps you should then. That's<br> a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try ?<br> I hope you haven't been talking about<br> anything too serious with this one.<br> No. Talking a bit of silliness really.<br> Can we have him for supper ?<br> Have him to stay for supper, Michael.<br> We're not cannibals.<br> You are welcome, you know.<br> Sylvia. Mr Barrie.<br> Where have you been ?<br> Flying a kite, Mother,<br> and having a wonderful time.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't know<br> you were coming this evening.<br> No ? Well, apparently you forgot then.<br> - I brought some supper along for us all.<br> - You didn't need to do that.<br> Well, there's no food in the house, is there ?<br> Really. You don't need to wait<br> till the cupboard is bare.<br> Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.<br> Wipe feet. There's been<br> enough tracking round here.<br> George, I thought you said you were going<br> to help your mother take care of the house.<br> Coat, Michael, please. Yes.<br> - And... coat hanger. Good.<br> - Will we see you tomorrow ?<br> No. You're going to be helping<br> round the house tomorrow.<br> Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.<br> You can't do everything yourself.<br> Look at you. You're horribly flush.<br> You're wearing yourself out.<br> Thank you for a lovely day, James.<br> Excuse me, Mother.<br> So from tomorrow, we're going to have<br> some discipline around here.<br> And not one of you will escape.<br> - Good evening, Mr Barrie.<br> - Good evening, Sarah.<br> - Good evening, Mr Barrie.<br> - Good evening, Emma.<br> You missed supper.<br> Perhaps I'll have something later.<br> I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.<br> Are you sure ? It was a lovely meal. Duck.<br> Sarah let Emma cook this evening.<br> Is that right ? Listen, what would you think<br> of loaning Emma out to the Davies<br> for the occasional evening ?<br> They don't actually have a cook.<br> I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal<br> that she had here ?<br> I imagine she could use an extra hand<br> now and again. That's all.<br> That's very charitable of you.<br> Perhaps we can send over<br> some of the silver as well.<br> And what about linen ?<br> I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers<br> was looking a bit shabby.<br> Please, Mary, stop.<br> Maybe she can send over<br> some of the things we've run short on.<br> My husband, for example.<br> We rarely see him in this house.<br> That hasn't seemed to bother you<br> for some time now.<br> Lords and ladies, His Royal Highness,<br> King Michael the Benevolent,<br> protector of the realm.<br> That scepter's made of wood.<br> Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,<br> don't we ?<br> No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made<br> of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.<br> The means to an end, Peter.<br> What we've done is taken<br> an old hunk of wood<br> and transformed it for all the world to see<br> into the most magnificent gold.<br> - There you go.<br> - What's this ?<br> All great writers begin with a good<br> leather binding and a respectable title.<br> Open it.<br> "The Boy Castaways."<br> "Being a record of the terrible adventures<br> of the brothers Davies,<br> faithfully set forth by...<br> Peter Llewelyn Davies."<br> Kipling would swallow his own ear<br> for a title like that.<br> Stab him, George. You can do it.<br> I still have no idea what to write.<br> Write about anything.<br> Write about your family.<br> - Write about the talking whale.<br> - What whale ?<br> The one that's trapped in your imagination<br> and desperate to get out. Come sit down.<br> I have actually begun writing about the<br> adventures of the Davies brothers myself.<br> - A play ?<br> - A play indeed, yes.<br> And I would be extremely honored<br> if you would allow me the use of your name<br> for one of the characters.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> Say yes.<br> Good man.<br> Porthos ! That's mine. Let go.<br> I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.<br> You should have been in bed<br> half an hour ago, young man.<br> I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax<br> in my discipline.<br> Nonsense. Young boys<br> should never be sent to bed.<br> They always wake up a day older.<br> And then, before you know it,<br> they're grown.<br> Their father would have been horrified.<br> Of course, he never would have allowed<br> a dog in the house either.<br> He'd have tied him up in the yard.<br> Right ! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.<br> You mean a lot to my boys, you know.<br> Especially Peter.<br> It seems to me<br> that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.<br> I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't<br> hurt as deeply as children do when they...<br> when they lose someone.<br> I lost my elder brother, David,<br> when I was just Peter's age.<br> And it nearly destroyed my mother.<br> James, I'm so sorry.<br> Your poor mother.<br> I can't imagine losing a child.<br> Aye.<br> She didn't get out of bed for months.<br> She wouldn't eat.<br> I tried everything to make her happy, but...<br> she only wanted David.<br> So...<br> one day...<br> I dressed myself in David's clothing<br> and I went to her.<br> You must have frightened her to death.<br> I think it was the first time<br> she ever actually... looked at me.<br> And that was the end of the boy James.<br> I used to say to myself<br> he'd gone to Neverland.<br> Where ?<br> Neverland. It's a wonderful place.<br> I've not spoken about this before<br> to anyone.<br> Ever.<br> What's it like... Neverland ?<br> One day I'll take you there.<br> Wait a minute, James.<br> He's a fairy ?<br> Er, no. He's the irrepressible<br> spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.<br> - Tinker Bell is a woman ?<br> - She's not a woman. She's a fairy.<br> He is a boy who stays young forever.<br> James, how does anyone<br> stay young forever ? It doesn't work.<br> He just believes, Charles.<br> He imagines life the way he wants it to be,<br> and he believes in it long enough and hard<br> enough that it all appears before him, see ?<br> James, I'm your friend.<br> You're coming off a flop.<br> - You have a man who is a fairy.<br> - No, a boy who has a fairy.<br> And this girl calls herself Tinker.<br> And you have a pirate ship on stage<br> surrounded by tons and tons of water.<br> - That's a lot of water.<br> - It's a lot of water.<br> - Yes, and that's a lot of money.<br> - It is, but we can fake the water.<br> Oh, well, if we can fake the water<br> then I'm sure your play will be a hit.<br> You know what I think I'll do ? I think<br> I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...<br> Long enough and hard enough ?<br> Yes, and then the money for the play<br> will appear magically before me.<br> - That's right. That's it.<br> - Yes.<br> How does the clock wind up<br> inside the crocodile ?<br> - He swallows it.<br> - Ah, of course he does.<br> Out !<br> How was he ?<br> - Well done.<br> - Good show !<br> I finally get the courage<br> to invite the boys to a game<br> and we have to suffer<br> this grave humiliation.<br> It's perfect actually.<br> Spend a good deal of time with them,<br> don't you ?<br> Every moment I can spare, in fact.<br> I'm glad for you.<br> And Mrs Davies seems to be<br> having a good time of it as well.<br> You should be aware though, James,<br> what some people have been saying.<br> Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up<br> if I thought the rumors would pass.<br> I'm not surprised. What are they saying ?<br> Very well.<br> That you spend much more time with Mrs<br> Davies than you do with your own wife.<br> She's a widow. And...<br> And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.<br> There have also been questions about<br> how you spend your time with those boys.<br> And why.<br> That's outrageous. How could anyone<br> think something so evil ?<br> They're children.<br> They're innocent children.<br> You find a glimmer of happiness<br> in this world,<br> there's always someone<br> who wants to destroy it.<br> No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think<br> many will give credence to such nonsense.<br> Then why is no one sitting with them ?<br> Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,<br> people watch you and they will<br> look for ways to drag you down.<br> Are you sure your wife doesn't<br> object to us taking over your cottage<br> for the summer, James ?<br> - She doesn't go there anymore.<br> - Really ?<br> It's such a relief to get away.<br> You'll come and visit, I hope ?<br> - Of course. Are we in ?<br> - Everyone in ?<br> - Can I drive, Uncle Jim ?<br> - Er, no.<br> Out of the way<br> or I'll make haggis out of you.<br> Get the sheep out the way.<br> - Are we there yet ?<br> - Almost. Almost there.<br> I can see the cottage !<br> - Shall we explore, Michael ?<br> - Don't tear your clothes, please.<br> - Come on. Follow me.<br> - Be careful of stinging nettles.<br> Hurry up, everyone.<br> - Would you like to see the rest of it ?<br> - Mm. Yes.<br> 'Ello !<br> Thought you could escape<br> from Captain Swarthy, eh ?<br> Off to the ship with you, then.<br> Off to the ship, son !<br> So now you can either choose<br> to become a pirate with the rest of us,<br> or we'll toss you to the sharks.<br> - How marvelous.<br> - Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh ?<br> - No one's escaped, Captain.<br> - Excellent work, matey.<br> Now then.<br> Now is your only chance to speak.<br> Who amongst you is ready<br> to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea ?<br> - I am !<br> - Not finished yet.<br> To enter upon<br> the most dangerous chapter<br> in your young<br> and soon-to-be-wasted lives ?<br> What did you say ? What are doing, son ?<br> Are you giggling ? On my ship ?<br> Giggling ? What did you say ?<br> - I said I'm ready, Captain.<br> - What's your name, boy ?<br> I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.<br> Cut him loose, matey.<br> Welcome aboard, Curly.<br> Your job will be to mop the deck.<br> And who be you, young squire ?<br> My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared<br> by men and greatly desired by the ladies.<br> Jack !<br> Welcome aboard, Nibs.<br> You shall polish all wood surfaces.<br> Grab a hold of that rigging.<br> - And you, lad ?<br> - I'm Peter.<br> That's not a pirate name.<br> What about Dastardly Jim, eh ?<br> No. Just Peter.<br> I like my name.<br> Very well.<br> In punishment for lack of an interesting<br> pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.<br> Cut him loose.<br> - What are you playing again ?<br> - The boy.<br> What have you got... ? Excuse me.<br> Mr Barrie, sir ?<br> There's been a mistake here, sir.<br> It says here I'm to play the nanny.<br> - I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh ?<br> - You're not actually the nanny.<br> You're a dog.<br> - What ?<br> - A Newfound land.<br> We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.<br> Rrr.<br> Oh, right.<br> Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,<br> do we ? He could play Tinker Bell.<br> Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.<br> It moves around the stage.<br> Just a wee light<br> that moves around the stage.<br> Bit worried about this.<br> Let's see.<br> We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,<br> Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.<br> It's a play for puppets.<br> Tootles, Nibs, Curly.<br> All these names are absurd<br> when you see them all together.<br> Captain Hook, S...<br> Oh, hello, James.<br> You're out of your mind.<br> How were rehearsals ?<br> Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.<br> - Good.<br> - Yes. Thank you.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - How was your journey ?<br> - It was quite long. I'm exhausted.<br> - Let's get you some tea.<br> - That'd be nice. Thanks.<br> - Can you come to the playhouse ?<br> - In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.<br> But I said I'd get him. They always<br> send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.<br> - It will spoil the surprise.<br> - What surprise, darling ?<br> It's a great surprise. We've taken<br> most of the day preparing for it.<br> - Everybody's waiting for you.<br> - Then we mustn't keep them waiting.<br> Please don't tell them that I told you<br> the surprise. I said I wouldn't.<br> Oh, well, you didn't really tell us<br> anything about it, did you ?<br> - Yes I did. It's a play.<br> - It's a play ?<br> "The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."<br> "A play in one act<br> by Peter Llewelyn Davies."<br> - This is just a bit of silliness, really.<br> - I should hope so. Go on.<br> I just wanted to take a stab at writing,<br> you know.<br> Well, the others do<br> a good job with it anyway.<br> Well, let's see it then.<br> "The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."<br> "One morning, just after sunrise,<br> Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter<br> of Lord and Lady Dubon,<br> made her way up the steps of the great<br> cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."<br> "Suddenly, as she reached<br> the cathedral doors,<br> the gargoyle that guarded<br> the sacred structure<br> came to life and swooped down upon her."<br> "The people of the village all ran to safety,<br> but Lady Ursula slipped<br> on the cathedral steps<br> and the gargoyle descended upon her,<br> wrapping her in its huge wings<br> and taking her high up into the spires<br> of the cathedral."<br> - Go on, Peter.<br> - "Not long after this sorrowful event,<br> a young knight named JM Barnaby<br> came into the city."<br> Sylvia.<br> - Do you want some water ?<br> - Mother ?<br> - No, James.<br> - Let's get her back to the house. Go on.<br> She won't discuss it with me at all.<br> She claims it was nothing.<br> I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.<br> You can't very well treat a patient<br> who won't admit there's anything wrong.<br> Well, you'll have to make her understand<br> that something is.<br> - I'll try and do my best.<br> - Great. Just there.<br> Get your hand flat like that.<br> Ow.<br> Then... Like that.<br> Come in.<br> The good doctor didn't feel<br> up to the challenge on this one.<br> He thinks you need to go to hospital<br> for further tests.<br> Nonsense.<br> When would I have time for that ?<br> Besides, this family's<br> had enough of hospitals.<br> - Perhaps they can help you.<br> - I know what they can do for me.<br> I saw what they did for my husband.<br> No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.<br> I'm keenly interested<br> in having some supper.<br> What did you and Mother decide<br> to tell us this time ? "It's only a chest cold" ?<br> - We hadn't decided anything.<br> - Stop lying to me !<br> I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.<br> I'm not lying to you.<br> I don't know what's wrong.<br> "Father might take us fishing,"<br> that's what she said. "ln just a few weeks."<br> And he died the next morning.<br> That wasn't a lie, Peter.<br> That was your mother's hope.<br> He barely moved for a week,<br> but I started planning our fishing trip.<br> I will never lie to you. I promise you that.<br> No, all you'll do is teach me<br> to make up stupid stories<br> and pretend that things<br> aren't happening until...<br> I won't ! I'm not blind.<br> I won't be made a fool.<br> What's this ? Peter.<br> The play.<br> Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.<br> Magic's gone out of it a bit now,<br> hasn't it ?<br> All because of a silly chest cold.<br> James.<br> Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,<br> don't you ?<br> Good evening.<br> Mr Cannan has been working on the<br> committee to fight government censorship.<br> I know how involved you've been as well.<br> He wanted to speak to you.<br> I did think you'd be home so much sooner.<br> It's been a long evening, Mary.<br> Yes.<br> Well, if I'd realized how late it was,<br> of course.<br> I should perhaps talk to you<br> at another time ? Not so late ?<br> That will be fine.<br> We'll talk then.<br> Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.<br> Mr Barrie.<br> - Good night.<br> - Night.<br> Well, aren't you going to speak ?<br> What would you like me to say ?<br> "Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"<br> I suppose.<br> And then, let's see. What comes next ?<br> "No later than you were out, James."<br> "And how is Mrs Davies this evening ?"<br> Oh, yes, I would have a great answer<br> for that one, wouldn't I ?<br> How dare you.<br> This isn't one of your plays.<br> I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.<br> But I'm not ready for this conversation,<br> wherever it may lead.<br> Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes ?<br> Good night then.<br> Mr Barrie. Don't you agree<br> this is a little bit tight ?<br> - No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.<br> - Baggy ?<br> Quite frumpy. I'd bring it right in just there.<br> That's very tight.<br> And put maybe a plank of wood there<br> to straighten him up.<br> - Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.<br> - Plank of wood ?<br> Some wood there on the shoulders as well.<br> - Otherwise, it's marvelous.<br> - Right, sir.<br> - You'll be sick tomorrow.<br> - I'll be sick tonight.<br> James.<br> We're just having some tea.<br> You remember my mother, of course.<br> Yes. Of course. How do you do ?<br> - May I take your hat ?<br> - That's enough, boys.<br> Boys, please don't run in the house.<br> You'll break something.<br> Come away from that door.<br> Come on, come on.<br> - I'd like a word with you,<br> Mr Barrie, before you go.<br> We'll only be a few minutes.<br> Boys, why don't you go<br> and play in the garden ? Go on.<br> - Is he in trouble ?<br> - Sh.<br> Because I've been alone with Grandmother<br> and I know what it's like.<br> - Should we retire into the study ?<br> - Why don't you join them, dear ?<br> Very well.<br> - I do apologize for interrupting.<br> - Would you close the door, please ?<br> Certainly.<br> Sylvia has told me you have offered her<br> the services of your household staff.<br> - Well, not exactly.<br> - That won't be necessary.<br> I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.<br> You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.<br> You see, I'm moving in here from now on.<br> - You're moving in ?<br> - I'm going where I'm most needed.<br> And I can certainly see to it<br> that this house is managed<br> without resorting to your charity.<br> It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.<br> I was only trying to help, as a friend.<br> Have you no idea how much your<br> friendship has already cost my daughter ?<br> Or are you really that selfish ?<br> I beg your pardon ?<br> Don't you see what a visit<br> to the summer cottage of a married man<br> does for a widow's future prospects ?<br> Sylvia needs to find someone.<br> The boys need a father.<br> And you are destroying any hope this<br> family has of pulling itself together again.<br> I have only wanted good things<br> for this family, Mrs du Maurier.<br> I'll look after them.<br> You have your own family<br> to concern yourself with.<br> What are you suggesting ?<br> I'm suggesting that you protect<br> what you have, Mr Barrie.<br> That is precisely what I am doing.<br> I was so certain what I would find in this.<br> Some little confession<br> would leak out onto the page.<br> I don't write love notes in my journal.<br> No.<br> Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you ?<br> That's some comfort, actually.<br> It means I know you just a little after all.<br> You needn't steal my journal<br> to get to know me, Mary.<br> No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.<br> I was hopelessly naive when I married you.<br> I imagined that brilliant people<br> disappeared to some secret place<br> where good ideas floated around<br> like leaves in autumn.<br> And I hoped, at least once...<br> you would take me there with you.<br> There is no such place.<br> Yes, there is.<br> Neverland.<br> It's the best you've written, James.<br> And I'm sure the Davies will adore<br> the world you've created for them.<br> I only wish I were part of it.<br> I've wanted you to be. I've tried.<br> Mary.<br> I always imagined us going off on<br> great adventures once we were together.<br> But we moved into this house<br> and you started, I don't know,<br> - you started rearranging the furniture.<br> - What was I supposed to do, James ?<br> You were always gone.<br> I was right here.<br> Sitting in your parlor, staring off<br> into other worlds as though I didn't exist.<br> Look. Just give me bit more time<br> to finish up the play.<br> To spend with your muse ?<br> No, I'm tired of waiting, James.<br> I'm tired of looking like a fool.<br> Well, I can't very well give up the play.<br> Of course not.<br> Just come home to me at the end of<br> the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.<br> No more trips to the country,<br> no more long afternoons in the park.<br> If you can't give us that much of a chance,<br> then we must end this.<br> And I will.<br> Pitiful display.<br> Nanny. Nanny.<br> What ?<br> First you get the pajamas,<br> then you make the bed.<br> With my paws ?<br> You make the bed with your paws.<br> The pajamas you get with your teeth.<br> Because in fact, being a dog,<br> you haven't any proper digits, have you ?<br> Well, I don't have any teeth, either.<br> I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.<br> All I've got is this rubbery snout.<br> - Can we get him some teeth ?<br> - He can have mine.<br> We'll get you teeth.<br> - Let's have a wee break, shall we ?<br> - Right.<br> - I thought you were wonderful.<br> - You were marvelous.<br> I think you're better on four legs<br> than you are on two.<br> - Oh, give it a rest.<br> - I do.<br> - Just say it, Charles, go on.<br> - Well, you picture it, James.<br> Opening night, doctors, lawyers,<br> businessmen and their wives,<br> all dressed to the nines.<br> They've paid good money, they're<br> expecting theater, what we call theater.<br> The curtain opens and it's crocodiles<br> and fairies and pirates and lndians.<br> I don't even know what it is.<br> But you did know, Charles. You're<br> an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.<br> Oh, don't patronize me, James.<br> You know how much money I put into<br> this show that I haven't even found yet ?<br> Listen, listen. Opening night,<br> I want 25 seats set aside.<br> - Set aside ? 25 ?<br> - 25 seats.<br> Scattered throughout the theater.<br> Two here, two there, three up there.<br> - Are they paying for it ?<br> - They're filled.<br> - No, no, no. I'm asking...<br> - The seats are filled.<br> - Uncle Jim ?<br> - Hello, boys.<br> Could I speak to you for a moment,<br> please ?<br> Certainly.<br> It'll be fantastic.<br> Who's paying for them ?<br> Throughout the theater.<br> - Who's paying for these 25 seats ?<br> - They're filled-up seats, Charles.<br> Whoa. Look.<br> This is great. I'm flying.<br> We don't need to use much pull at all, see ?<br> As long as we've got the balance down.<br> Mother asked me to take the boys out<br> for the afternoon.<br> She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,<br> but she was trembling so badly<br> she couldn't even finish her tea.<br> I'm not a fool, Uncle James.<br> I deserve to know the truth.<br> I don't know the truth.<br> She won't talk about it.<br> But you think it's serious ?<br> It could be. The doctor felt<br> she should go and have some tests.<br> Then you'll have to convince her<br> to go then.<br> I've tried. She won't listen to me.<br> And lately, to be quite honest,<br> it seems that all my best intentions for<br> your family have come to nothing but harm.<br> Apparently I've made<br> quite a mess of things.<br> It's Grandmother, isn't it ?<br> She's run you off, hasn't she ?<br> Oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.<br> And perhaps with good reason.<br> It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...<br> She just doesn't want<br> to see Mother hurt anymore.<br> Look at that.<br> How magnificent.<br> The boy's gone.<br> Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,<br> you've become a grown-up.<br> Right then. I think you should be the one<br> to talk to her, George.<br> - But I wouldn't know what to say.<br> - You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.<br> Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.<br> - It's Nana, he's expired backstage.<br> - What's happened ?<br> I think his costume is too tight.<br> It's not possible, too tight.<br> George, give me a minute, I'll be back.<br> Pull that one tight.<br> Here, last one.<br> OK. Flap those wings.<br> - There you go.<br> - Whoa !<br> - Can I have a go ?<br> - Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.<br> Give that a tug. Go on.<br> - Just give it a little pull.<br> - Can I have a go ?<br> - In a minute. In a minute.<br> - Can I have a go ?<br> - Jack. Pull me higher.<br> - I have to concentrate.<br> - Stop it now, boys.<br> - No, Michael.<br> Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.<br> - I want to do it now.<br> - No, don't go down there.<br> What are you... ?<br> Ow !<br> Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.<br> - I'm so sorry.<br> - George ?<br> Mr Barrie ?<br> Mrs Davies would like a word with you.<br> No, just Mr Barrie.<br> - Did you encourage this ?<br> - Encourage what ?<br> Oh, James, please.<br> You know perfectly well what.<br> George won't allow them to set his arm<br> unless I submit to an examination.<br> I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,<br> because he's quite a stubborn young man<br> when he sets his mind to it.<br> This is absurd.<br> They won't tell me anything different.<br> Different ?<br> So you've already spoken to a doctor then ?<br> That is not your concern.<br> My understanding is that my condition<br> may be quite serious.<br> However... my wish is that<br> life should go on as normal.<br> So,<br> I'll have the examination,<br> and I'll take whatever medications<br> they advise.<br> But I don't want to know what they're for.<br> And I don't want you inquiring into it<br> any further.<br> Wouldn't dream of it.<br> Mary ?<br> Mary ?<br> Peter, could you help George<br> to fold a pocket handkerchief, please ?<br> - They're in the linen cupboard. Darling ?<br> - Yes, Mother.<br> Jack, how do you manage<br> to always come untucked ?<br> Would you check your shirt-tails<br> in the intermission, please ?<br> Yes, Mother.<br> You're not planning on attending<br> any after-theater events, are you ?<br> Only for a short time if we do. The tickets !<br> - With the children ?<br> - George !<br> Um, possibly. Would you see<br> if George has the tickets, please ?<br> - I'll just check the dressing table.<br> - Sylvia, there's a...<br> Mother, please see if George has<br> the tickets. Michael, where are your socks ?<br> Wait here, don't move.<br> Take her feet, George.<br> We'll need some more blankets.<br> Oh, take Michael with you, would you ?<br> She looks much worse<br> than when we were at the cottage.<br> Sh, Michael.<br> - Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up ?<br> - No, sir. Not yet.<br> Precisely. Have there been<br> many people asking for seats ?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Charles.<br> I suggest you start selling them.<br> Yes, James ?<br> Have you seen any of the Davies family<br> yet this evening ?<br> The 25 seats, are they filled ?<br> - It's taken care of.<br> - Yes. Yes.<br> Who did you invite ? Because obviously<br> whoever you invited decided not to come.<br> - The seats will be filled, I promise.<br> - Yes. You've been promising me all...<br> - Charles ?<br> - Hello, Mr Stanley.<br> Have you seen the Davies family<br> this evening ?<br> No, sir.<br> - Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.<br> - Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.<br> Yes, you do, dear.<br> I think I'll get some camomile<br> to help you relax.<br> Peter will be here if you need anything.<br> Peter.<br> Peter.<br> Can I do anything, Mother ?<br> No, darling.<br> You must go to the play.<br> - I can't do that.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> I need you to.<br> I need you to come back tonight<br> and tell me every bit of it.<br> Please.<br> It's only a play, Mother.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> What do you want ?<br> Take it out.<br> Open it.<br> I've never been so proud of you.<br> Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Last call.<br> Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.<br> We had time to sell those 25 seats.<br> The play's starting.<br> - Charles.<br> - What ?<br> - They're here.<br> - Who's here ?<br> Do forgive them being a bit late -<br> short legs, long walk from the orphanage.<br> I'm not clear what they're doing here.<br> - They've come to see the play.<br> - Mm-hm.<br> - That's the 25 seats.<br> - Mm.<br> Now my nightmare is complete.<br> You can start your play now.<br> Your play.<br> Get them in the scattered seats.<br> Just there, boys.<br> Excuse me, sir. This way.<br> Thank you.<br> Looks like we got<br> one of the better-dressed ones.<br> I just want you to know,<br> I think you're a wonderful dog.<br> Thanks.<br> I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.<br> Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.<br> Two minutes more.<br> Please. One minute more.<br> Nana, I will not be bathed.<br> I tell you, I will not be bathed.<br> Who are you ?<br> No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.<br> My children.<br> - How is she ?<br> - She's resting.<br> - May I see her ?<br> - No, Mr Barrie.<br> I don't think we need to include you in<br> everything that goes on in this household.<br> - But she'd want to see him.<br> - Be quiet, George.<br> And since, as I've discovered,<br> you've seen fit to conceal certain facts<br> about my daughter's condition from me,<br> I feel no remorse at excluding you<br> from my home.<br> But you can't...<br> - Go upstairs, George, now.<br> - Stop ordering me about.<br> This isn't your home. It's our home.<br> Just cos Mother's<br> needed your help recently<br> doesn't give you the right<br> to rule over her existence.<br> She's not a child anymore,<br> and neither am I.<br> If she wants to see Uncle Jim,<br> she can see Uncle Jim.<br> There's nothing you can do about it.<br> - Mother ?<br> - Yes, darling ?<br> James.<br> No. Your play.<br> Look at all this.<br> I'd have come tonight, it's just...<br> - Mother, you need to rest.<br> - ..l still have things to do here.<br> See ? This needs mending.<br> Four boys, no end of patches.<br> Can't seem to keep up.<br> I haven't the time for all this.<br> Don't look at me like that, James.<br> You make me feel so utterly exposed.<br> Boys, would you give me a moment<br> with your mother, please ? Thank you.<br> They can see it, you know.<br> You can't go on just pretending.<br> "Just pretending" ?<br> You brought pretending<br> into this family, James.<br> You showed us we can change things<br> by simply believing them to be different.<br> A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.<br> But the things that matter.<br> We've pretended for some time now<br> that you're a part of this family, haven't we ?<br> You've come to mean so much to us all<br> that now it doesn't matter if it's true.<br> And even if it isn't true,<br> even if that can never be...<br> I need to go on pretending.<br> Until the end.<br> With you.<br> - Oh, I am sweet.<br> - How do you do it ?<br> You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts<br> and they lift you up in the air.<br> You are so nippy at it.<br> Couldn't you do it very slowly once ?<br> Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.<br> I must blow fairy dust on you first.<br> Now try. Try it from the beds.<br> Just wriggle your shoulders like this<br> and then let go.<br> - I flew !<br> - How ripping !<br> Now join hands.<br> - Look at me !<br> - I do like it !<br> - Bravo !<br> - Let's go out.<br> Second on the right<br> and straight on till morning.<br> Genius.<br> - Sylvia, don't move.<br> - I feel a little better.<br> - It's been a bad day, that's all.<br> Now I want you to go back to the theater.<br> Find Peter.<br> - Of course.<br> - Thank you.<br> Are you sure there's nothing else<br> I can do for you ?<br> No.<br> Well,<br> I have always wanted to go to Neverland.<br> You did promise to tell me about it,<br> you know.<br> Aye. That I did.<br> It's a bit late for it tonight though, I'm afraid.<br> Perhaps some time soon though ?<br> Most definitely.<br> - D'you mean we shall both be drowned ?<br> - Look how the water is rising.<br> It must be the tail of the kite<br> we made for Michael.<br> You remember. It tore itself<br> out of his hands and floated away.<br> - The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you ?<br> - Both of us.<br> It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.<br> I won't go without you, Peter.<br> Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.<br> And you a lady ? Never.<br> Ready, Wendy ?<br> Peter !<br> Don't let go, Wendy.<br> Peter, I'm frightened.<br> Hang on, Wendy !<br> Peter !<br> To die will be an awfully big adventure.<br> - I'm glad you came.<br> - Well...<br> I've never missed an opening.<br> So I...<br> assume you heard about Gilbert and I.<br> Yes.<br> Quite the scandal, so I'm told.<br> How are you ?<br> I'm all right.<br> How are you ?<br> I'm sorry.<br> Don't be.<br> Without that family, you could<br> never have written anything like this.<br> You need them.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Mr Barrie.<br> - Mrs Snow.<br> Thank you. That was quite the nicest<br> evening I've ever spent in the theater.<br> Very kind of you to say. Thank you.<br> Where's Mr Snow this evening ?<br> Oh.<br> I'm afraid he's left us.<br> And he would so have loved this evening.<br> The pirates and the lndians.<br> He was really just a boy himself, you know.<br> To the very end.<br> I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing ?<br> I'm doing well enough now, thank you.<br> I suppose it's all the work<br> of the ticking crocodile, isn't it ?<br> Time is chasing after all of us.<br> Isn't that right ?<br> - That's right, Mrs Snow.<br> - Aunt Rose, your drink.<br> Thank you. I mustn't keep you.<br> You've a lot of friends here.<br> Well, it's lovely to see you.<br> I'm terribly sorry, once again.<br> - Was that Mr Barrie ?<br> - That was Mr Barrie.<br> Well done, Mr Barrie.<br> - Good show.<br> - Well done.<br> Psst.<br> What did you think ?<br> - It's about our summer together, isn't it ?<br> - It is.<br> - About all of us.<br> - That's right.<br> Did you like it ?<br> It's magical. Thank you.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Thank you, Peter.<br> - This is Peter Pan ! How wonderful.<br> - Really ?<br> You're Peter Pan ? Why, you must be<br> quite the little adventurer.<br> Look, it's true.<br> He has no shadow.<br> But I'm not Peter Pan.<br> He is.<br> And there's been no improvement<br> since my last visit ?<br> No.<br> Has James been by at all today, Mother ?<br> Dr Brighton. May I have a word ?<br> Excuse me a moment.<br> You haven't been keeping him from me,<br> have you ?<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I actually hoped he might come.<br> Would have proved me wrong about him.<br> Of course, with the success of his play,<br> the whole of London<br> must be knocking at his door.<br> I'm sorry, dear.<br> - What is it ?<br> - It's a secret.<br> - Quiet, Michael.<br> - I didn't say anything.<br> Mother, could you come downstairs<br> for a moment ?<br> Oh, she can't come downstairs.<br> What are you thinking of, George ?<br> Actually, I think a trip downstairs<br> might do her good, ma'am.<br> - What have you been up to ?<br> - Just wait and see.<br> It's a play.<br> It's not just a play, Michael.<br> It's the play.<br> Of course, we'll have to make do<br> with a few compromises.<br> Much of it will have to be imagined.<br> - As it should be.<br> - As it should be, that's right.<br> Michael, come and sit here,<br> next to Mum.<br> When you're ready.<br> I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.<br> Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.<br> Two minutes more. Please.<br> - You know fairies, Peter ?<br> - Yes.<br> But they're nearly all dead now.<br> You see, Wendy, when the first baby<br> laughed for the first time,<br> the laugh broke into a thousand pieces<br> and they all went skipping about<br> and that was the beginning of fairies.<br> And now when every new baby is born,<br> its first laugh becomes a fairy.<br> So there ought to be one fairy<br> for every boy and girl.<br> - Ought to be ? lsn't there ?<br> - Oh, no.<br> Children know such a lot now.<br> Soon, they don't believe in fairies.<br> And every time a child says,<br> "l don't believe in fairies,"<br> there's a fairy somewhere<br> that falls down dead.<br> Who is that ?<br> The redskins were defeated ?<br> Wendy and the boys<br> captured by the pirates ?<br> I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her !<br> Oh, that's just my medicine.<br> Poisoned ? Who could have poisoned it ?<br> Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.<br> It was poisoned.<br> And you drank it to save my life ?<br> Tink.<br> Are you dying ?<br> Her light is growing faint.<br> If it goes out, that means she's dead.<br> Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear<br> what she's saying.<br> She says she thinks<br> she could get well again<br> if children believed in fairies.<br> Do you believe in fairies ?<br> Say quick that you believe.<br> If you believe, clap your hands.<br> Clap louder.<br> Thank you. Thank you.<br> That is Neverland.<br> So many perfect days.<br> I really began to believe<br> we'd go on like that forever.<br> Oh, stop it.<br> She wasn't going to stay with you forever.<br> She had a husband. My father.<br> She never cared for you<br> the way she did for him.<br> I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.<br> I could never do that.<br> You'd best let him go.<br> George, would you take the boys back<br> to the house ? I'll be with you in a moment.<br> Go on, dear.<br> I'm terribly sorry.<br> I've ruined everything I've touched<br> in this family.<br> Stop giving yourself so much credit.<br> Peter's grieving.<br> It has nothing to do with you.<br> Perhaps if I just had<br> a bit more time with him.<br> No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.<br> If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,<br> you'd better leave him alone.<br> I know you don't much care for me,<br> Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,<br> but I loved your daughter very much.<br> And I love those boys.<br> And I think they need me right now.<br> Is that so ?<br> And for how long after ?<br> Meaning what ?<br> Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship<br> for the boys in her will.<br> You, Mr Barrie, and myself.<br> - And what do you have to say about that ?<br> - I shall respect my daughter's wishes.<br> Something I should have done more of<br> while she was alive.<br> But if you feel you're not ready<br> for such a commitment,<br> I assure you I can certainly<br> look after the boys by myself.<br> Do you think I could abandon those boys ?<br> Sit down, Peter.<br> Mother pasted it back together<br> after I ruined it.<br> And then I saw the play.<br> I just started writing<br> and I haven't been able to stop.<br> She would be very pleased to know that.<br> Listen. I've just spoken<br> with your grandmother<br> and I'm staying.<br> For good.<br> I'm sorry I was so horrible.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's just...<br> I thought she'd always be here.<br> So did I.<br> But, in fact...<br> she is.<br> Because she's on every page<br> of your imagination.<br> You'll always have her there. Always.<br> But why did she have to die ?<br> I don't know, boy.<br> When I think of your mother...<br> I will always remember<br> how happy she looked<br> sitting there in the parlor,<br> watching a play about her family.<br> About her boys that never grew up.<br> She went to Neverland.<br> And you can visit her any time you like<br> if you just go there yourself.<br> How ?<br> By believing, Peter.<br> Just believe.<br> I can see her.<br>
