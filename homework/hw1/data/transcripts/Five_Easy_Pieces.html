It's more<br> like two years, isn't it? Hmm?<br> Oh, it's been more than that, Carl.<br> Tita, you have no sense of timing<br> away from the piano, dear.<br> I don't think that's true.<br> It's true.<br> What have you been doing since then?<br> Odd jobs of work here and there.<br> Nothing too interesting.<br> You no longer play at all?<br> [Carl] You know, Robert,<br> before my misfortune -<br> I'm not sure you're aware of my accident,<br> Robert. Mm-hmm?<br> Yeah. Tita was telling me about it.<br> Well, you know, it's very difficult for me<br> to turn my neck.<br> This way especially. If I -<br> For instance, if I want to look at Catherine...<br> I have to shift the whole base<br> of my body around this way.<br> - Hmm?<br> - I was real sorry to hear about it, Carl.<br> - Hmm?<br> - I said I was real sorry to hear about it.<br> Anyway, as I was saying -<br> Catherine, what was I saying?<br> Hmm?<br> You were saying something...<br> about something that happened<br> around the time of the accident.<br> Oh!

Ooh!<br> - You sure you should be playing, Carl?<br> - [Groans]<br> What do you mean? I'm in superb shape -<br> except for my neck. Hmm?<br> Well, there's something funny<br> about the way you move.<br> I'm not aware of - What do you mean?<br> I'd hate to see you walk across<br> a concert stage like that.<br> - Oh! [Chuckles]<br> - 2-19.<br> I'd get somebody to coach you<br> on how to walk if I was you, Carl.<br> I think it's a substantial problem.<br> [Chuckles Softly]<br> Damn it.<br> Look at that.<br> [Chuckles]<br> - Why are you being so mean?<br> - Mean? I'm not being mean.<br> He does walk funny.<br> Don't you see that?<br> - He's walking around -<br> - [Laughing]<br> I don't think I'd notice.<br> I'm so used to Carl.<br> Yeah, well -<br> [Laughs]<br> Bobby, do you think Spicer<br> is attractive?<br> I think he's got a terrific personality.<br> [Tita]<br> Spicer was formerly a sailor.<br> Look.

It's just, um -<br> I picked the easiest piece<br> that I could think of...<br> and I first played it when I was eight years old,<br> and I played it better then. [Chuckles]<br> Can't you understand it was<br> the feeling I was affected by?<br> I didn't have any.<br> - You had no inner feeling?<br> - None.<br> Well, then, I must have been supplying it.<br> Maybe if you'd supply a little more,<br> it might rub off on me. Who knows?<br> I doubt it.<br> Oh, I could get interested.<br> Well, I couldn't.<br> - [Door Slams]<br> - [Footfalls Retreating]<br> [Single Note]<br> What does it have to be with you?<br> Grim and serious?<br> Look, you played...<br> I honestly responded...<br> and you made me feel embarrassed<br> for having responded to you.<br> - It wasn't necessary.<br> - Yeah, it was.<br> I faked a little Chopin,<br> you faked a big response.<br> [Chuckling]<br> I don't think that's accurate.<br> Up till now, all I've been getting from you<br> is meaningful looks at the dinner table...<br> and a lot of vague suggestions<br> about the day after tomorrow.<br> I am not conscious of having given you<br> any particular looks.<br> And as for the day after tomorrow,<br> this is the day after tomorrow.<br> And I am, unfortunately, seeing you.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me,<br> I'd like to take a bath.<br> - What the hell do you want anyway?<br> - I'm getting some bath oil.<br> - Some bath oil?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> How about some avocado or some of this?<br> Or some of this jasmine?

But ask Carl.<br> Ask him if even the institution of marriage<br> is completely free from it.<br> Ask him.<br> I think these cold, objective<br> discussions are aggressive.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - That's reactive.<br> - [Thunderclap]<br> - But if I may say...<br> without dampening<br> the spirit of your adventure -<br> You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Well, I should hope not.<br> But I want to say, though,<br> it's still open to some discussion -<br> - I'm sorry. [Speaking French]<br> - that there seems to be less aggression...<br> - or violence, if you like -<br> - I'm sorry. I don't speak French.<br> - the higher classes and loftier natures -<br> - [Dog Barks]<br> What kind of doggy is this?<br> - [Carl] This is a, uh, border collie.<br> - [Continues, Indistinct]<br> - I had a baby kitty-cat once.<br> - [Samia Continues]<br> It was a little fluffy thing.<br> Bobby gave it to me.<br> - Remember, Bobby?<br> - [Indistinct, Stops]<br> Little pussycat you gave me?<br> Yeah.<br> It had two little white front paws.<br> And, oh, I was crazy after her.<br> We left her at some friends' house...<br> and she got squashed flatter than<br> a tortilla right outside their mobile home.<br> There. Do you see what I mean?<br> The choice of words juxtaposed<br> with the image of a fluffy kitten.<br> The enchantment of words -<br> "squashed," "flat," etcetera, etcetera.<br> Well, she was.<br> Well, perhaps, but it was<br> just what I was trying to point out.<br> Don't sit there pointing at her.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> - I said, don't point at her, you creep.<br> - But I was just telling about -<br> Where the hell do you get the ass<br> to tell anybody anything about class...<br> or who the hell's got it<br> or what she typifies?<br> You shouldn't even be in the same room<br> with her, you pompous celibate.<br> - Carl, this is really too much.<br> - Just calm down -<br> You're totally full of shit!<br> You're all full of shit!<br> - [Thunderclap]<br> - [Rain Falling]<br> Catherine!<br> Catherine.<br> - Bobby -<br> - I can't talk to you. Leave me alone.<br> Catherine?<br> [Tita Chattering]<br> - What the hell is goin' on in here?<br> - What are you doing?<br> [Spicer Muttering]<br> - Hey, where is Catherine?<br> - Hey, get out of - This is my room.<br> - I don't know where Catherine is.<br> - [Arguing, Indistinct]<br> I'm talking to you -<br> I'm talking to you, Tita!<br> - Be polite, will you?<br> - I told you to take your hands off my sister, nurse!<br> - Move out!<br> - Stop it!<br> [Tita]<br> Stop it!

Yes.<br> I'm sorry.<br> [Bird Squawking]<br> Okay.<br> [Dog Barking In Distance]<br> Are you cold?<br> [Sighs]<br> I don't know if you'd be...<br> particularly interested<br> in hearing anything about me.<br> My life - I mean...<br> most of it doesn't add up<br> to much that I could relay it...<br> as a way of life<br> that you'd approve of.<br> I move around a lot.<br> Not because I'm looking<br> for anything really, but -<br> 'Cause I'm getting away<br> from things that get bad...<br> if I stay.<br> Auspicious beginnings -<br> you know what I mean?<br> [Sighs]<br> [Sighs]<br> I'm trying to imagine your -<br> your half of this conversation.<br> [Clears Throat]<br> My feeling is - I don't know -<br> that, uh, if you could talk,<br> we wouldn't be talking.<br> That's pretty much the way<br> that it got to be before I left.<br> Are you all right?<br> I don't know what to say.<br> [Gasping]<br> Tita suggested that we try to -<br> I don't know.<br> I think that she feels -<br> I think that she feels that we've got<br> some understanding to reach.<br> She totally denies the fact<br> that we were never that comfortable...<br> with one another to begin with.<br> The best that I can do is apologize, and -<br> We both know that I was never<br> really that good at it anyway.<br> I'm sorry it didn't work out.<br> - Bobby!<br> - [Rain Falling]<br> - You're leaving.<br> - Yeah.<br> I said a week.<br> I think I overstayed myself.<br> You were going<br> without saying good-bye to me.<br> [Sighs] I didn't want<br> to say good-bye to anyone.<br> What about me?<br> I'll say good-bye to you, Tita.<br> Oh, Robert.<br> [Rain Stops]<br> - [Rayette] Watch the birdie.<br> - [Shutter Clicks]<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Come on.<br> - Wait a sec.<br> - I want to go.<br> - I want Tita to take a picture...<br> - of you and me in front of the place.<br> - [Bobby Mutters]<br> Listen, I never got to thank y'all<br> for your hospitality.<br> You tell Carl for me if any of you want<br> to come down to our place anytime...<br> you'd be more than welcome.<br> Bye now.<br> [Rayette]<br> Your kiss is like <br> [Rayette]<br> Your kiss is like <br> A drink <br> When I am thirsty <br> Oh, and I'm thirsty <br> For you <br> With all my heart <br> But don't love me then pretend <br> As though we've never kissed <br> Don't touch me <br> Don't touch me <br> Don't touch me <br> Don't touch - <br> Cut it out!<br> Son of a bitch, Bobby!<br> You quit pushing me away like that!<br> I've had enough of that<br> to last me an entire lifetime.<br> Why don't you just be good to me<br> for a change?<br> There isn't anybody gonna look after you<br> and love you as good as I do.<br> Did you hear me?<br> Baby?<br> [Lever Clicks]<br> [Gas Pump Bell Dings]<br> I'm-I'm goin' in that caf<br> for some coffee.<br> You want anything?<br> No.<br> You got any change?<br> You don't have any change?<br> [Shouting]<br> Sure you don't want anything?<br> Fill it up, will you?<br> [Gas Pump Bell Dings]<br> [Air Brakes Hiss]<br> [Coughing]<br> Hey, wait a minute.<br> [No Audible Dialogue]<br> Haven't you got a jacket<br> or anything with you?<br> Oh, no.
