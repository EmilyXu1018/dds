There's half a dozen of them.<br> All right?<br> Hey, Craig, come on in.<br> Captain William Whitaker?<br> Nod if you can hear me<br> and understand me.<br> l'm Craig Matson from the NT... NTSB.<br> And l am required<br> as the lead on the Go<br> to make initial contact with you<br> after a major incident<br> like the one you had today.<br> You are in a hospital in South Atlanta.<br> Are you aware that<br> the plane you were piloting went down?<br> l have a doctor here who can explain<br> your medical situation.<br> l'm Dr. Kenan.<br> And the good news is<br> you're in good condition.<br> You did suffer a concussion,<br> you have numerous lacerations<br> around your left eye.<br> We're going to<br> keep the patch on for a few days.<br> Just as a precaution.<br> Your eye seems to be okay.<br> Now, the MRls show<br> that you have some strained tendons<br> in your left knee and ankle,<br> and you have no broken bones.<br> But you have some<br> deep bruising in your left thigh<br> and some torn ligaments<br> in your left wrist.<br> Nothing serious.<br> So, as soon as we clear<br> your concussion<br> and you feel well enough,<br> you can go home.<br> That may take a day,<br> maybe three. Okay?<br> l won't ask too much of you tonight,<br> but as l said, the NTSB is<br> required to make initial contact.<br> How much do you remember<br> about the flight?<br> l remember...<br> l remember everything up till the crash.<br> Okay.<br> Mr. Whitaker, that's fine.<br> l am required<br> to inform you that this incident<br> did result in the loss of life.<br> The current information states that<br> of the 1 02 souls on board, we lost six.<br> Two crew members<br> and four passengers.<br> Fifty-nine people<br> were treated and released,<br> Who did we lose on the crew?<br> The two flight attendants,<br> Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.<br> The rep from your pilots' union,<br> Mr. Anderson, will be<br> our contact for you.<br> lt's important that<br> you follow your union's guidance<br> on press and media.<br> The pilots' union works<br> closely with the NTSB.<br> So, l'm going to head out.<br> l'll turn this off.<br> -Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.<br> -Thank you.<br> l knew Trina Marquez. She was...<br> We spent some time together.<br> Yeah, apparently,<br> she wasn't strapped in.<br> A survivor reported<br> she was assisting a kid.<br> Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?<br> Broken collarbone, just, l mean, cuts.<br> l mean, she's banged up, but she's...<br> She's here, too. She's fine.<br> And Ken Evans, your copilot,<br> he took a bad shot to the head.<br> And they're keeping him in a coma<br> just to let the brain swelling go down,<br> but we feel good about him.<br> He's going to be okay.<br> What are you doing here, Charlie?<br> l'm flying a desk now.<br> l'm a rep for the pilots' union.<br> You're the rep for the pilots' union?<br> Yeah, l'm one of them.<br> When your plane went down,<br> all the reps got a page<br> and l just shot up my hand,<br> 'cause l know you, said l wanted to<br> come be the first face you'd see.<br> l'm glad you're here.<br> The union's gonna<br> release a statement on your behalf,<br> condolences to the families<br> who lost loved ones,<br> gratitude to the brave men<br> and women of the flight crew.<br> That's... You don't have<br> to worry about that.<br> And l know you and Deana have<br> been divorced for a while now,<br> but maybe she<br> and your son, Will, wanna...<br> Yeah, Knuckles...<br> How old is he now?<br> Too old.

We'd Iike...<br> This is the NBC affiIiate in Athens.<br> We're Iooking to...<br> In the wake of the deadIy<br> crash of SouthJet flight 227,<br> we have more questions than answers<br> as to what exactIy happened that day.<br> And Iike many,<br> we are out Iooking for answers.<br> Looking here at the home of piIot<br> Captain WiIIiam "Whip" Whitaker.<br> We stiII have no sighting<br> and no comments<br> from the Captain himseIf.<br> This is Mark MeIIon, stiII on the hunt,<br> from midtown AtIanta.<br> You've reached<br> the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company,<br> flying Iessons and pIane rides.<br> PIease Ieave a message<br> and it wiII be returned. Thank you.<br> Hey, cowboy. It's Charlie again.<br> Listen, I'm back in town<br> and I stopped by the hospitaI tonight,<br> but they said you'd gone home,<br> so you must be feeIing pretty good.<br> Listen, l went out to your condo<br> and the manager said<br> you had not returned,<br> so you may be with relatives,<br> which l understand,<br> but l know you have<br> a doctor's appointment<br> early in the morning for your eye,<br> and l was just hoping<br> that you could meet us for breakfast.<br> About 1 0:00 at the St. Regis,<br> there's an executive buffet there.<br> And we'll be<br> covering some pretty important stuff,<br> so it'd be nice to have you there.<br> All right.

Hey, buddy.<br> Man, you look good.<br> l feel good.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Glad you got my message.<br> -How's your eye?<br> -Good, good.<br> This is Hugh Lang,<br> he's an attorney from Chicago.<br> -Pleasure to meet you, Captain.<br> -My pleasure.<br> -Sit down. You want a coffee?<br> -Yes, l do.<br> -Could we have some fresh coffee?<br> -Yes, sir.<br> We were just talking<br> about your copilot's wife.<br> Told a newspaper that<br> "God landed that plane."<br> Yeah? Oh, God landed that plane?<br> Well, l do believe God landed the plane.<br> Same way l believe<br> God should hit the buffet,<br> the turkey sausage is excellent.<br> l'm fine with coffee, thank you.<br> So, Len Caldwell<br> really wanted to get here this morning.<br> Len's the president of the pilots' union.<br> He wanted to be here<br> to meet with us and you,<br> but they need him at the crash site.<br> As you know, when a plane goes down,<br> the NTSB sends a Go to the crash site immediately.<br> They find the flight data recorder?<br> They did. lt's perfectly intact.<br> Oh, great. Great, great, great.<br> Then that solves everything.<br> So why do we need<br> a lawyer from Chicago?<br> Well, Hugh specializes<br> in criminal negligence.<br> Criminal negligence?<br> Death demands responsibility.<br> Six dead on that plane,<br> someone has to pay.<br> Yeah, but that's a plane<br> that fell apart at...<br> Thank you. Fell apart at 30,000 feet.<br> The airline will try<br> to prove equipment failure,<br> which is gonna make<br> the manufacturer responsible.<br> The manufacturer in turn<br> is gonna try and prove<br> poor maintenance<br> of the equipment by the airline.<br> Or pilot error.<br> l flew the plane inverted,<br> that means upside down, Hugh.<br> You get the picture? A hundred people,<br> upside down, 500 feet off the ground.<br> Do you have any idea what that's like?<br> l do. l heard the black box<br> recordings last night.<br> Oh, you heard. Are you a pilot?<br> No, l'm not.<br> You don't know what the fuck<br> you're talking about, do you?<br> Hugh's on our team, Whip.<br> -ls he?<br> -Yeah, he is.<br> -He doesn't act like he's on our team.<br> -Well, he is.<br> Asking me questions<br> about fucking pilot error.<br> Listen, it's the NTSB's ball game.<br> They run the investigation.<br> And they will ultimately<br> rule on the cause.<br> And that's why we need him.<br> Well, they interview<br> the entire flight crew.<br> They interview the passengers.<br> They hold public hearings.<br> All right, let's cut to the chase.<br> Just tell me<br> what it is l need to know, Charlie.<br> The NTSB Go Team also collects<br> blood, hair and skin samples<br> from the entire flight crew for<br> the purposes of a toxicology report.<br> Okay. When do they want to do that?<br> They've already done that.<br> ln the hospital.<br> lt's the first thing they do.<br> You don't remember having<br> your blood drawn the night of the crash?<br> -No.<br> -No.<br> They get the results of this test?<br> Yeah, they do.<br> Anything else for you gentlemen?<br> Yeah. You had warm cinnamon buns<br> over there, right?<br> Yes, sir.<br> -Could you get me one of those, please?<br> -Sure.<br> ln fact, get me two of them.<br> -Yes, sir. Coming up.<br> -Thank you, sweetie.<br> Now, an initial report shows that<br> you had alcohol in your system<br> at a level of .24.<br> Now in the good old U.S. ofA.,<br> one of the most lenient<br> drunk driving countries in the world,<br> you go to jail for driving<br> with anything above .08.<br> And by driving, l mean a car.<br> Thank you.<br> So... That doesn't mean anything.<br> l had a couple of beers<br> the night before the flight.<br> That made the tail of the plane explode?<br> -A couple of beers?<br> -Yeah, a couple of beers.<br> You know, l need a lawyer, Charlie.<br> -Hugh is your lawyer.<br> -l need a bigger lawyer.<br> l need a lawyer that understands<br> that someone put me in a broken plane.<br> Without me up there, there would have<br> been 1 02 funerals, not six.<br> We're not talking<br> about funerals right now, Captain.<br> Well, then what are we talking about?<br> We're talking about prison time.<br> -What?<br> -Lawsuits.<br> -Somebody has to pay.<br> -What, write a check?<br> lt's not gonna be me, l promise you that.<br> As long as they're writing checks,<br> tell them to write one for me, too.<br> Because someone put me<br> in a broken plane.<br> l'd love a check, Charlie.<br> This toxicology report<br> states that you were drunk<br> and high on cocaine.<br> Felonies punishable by<br> up to 1 2 years in prison.<br> And if it is proven that your intoxication<br> was the cause of the death<br> of the four passengers,<br> now we're gonna look at<br> four counts of manslaughter.<br> That could be life in prison.<br> Now can l please<br> do my job on your behalf<br> and kill this tox report?<br> He's gonna get it done, Whip.<br> He'll get it done.<br> lt's what his whole life's about.<br> Trust me. Trust him.<br> You don't have to worry,<br> you'll walk away from this the hero.<br> l'm not worried, Charlie.<br> l promise you that l'm not worried.<br> No one could have landed<br> that plane like l did.<br> No one.<br> -Thanks for coming.<br> -Yeah.<br> Excuse me.<br> -Excuse me.<br> -Yes.<br> Yeah, let me have an orange juice.<br> Large orange juice.<br> Just orange juice?<br> Yeah. No.<br> Double Stoli. Neat.<br> It paints a picture to me anyway<br> of a reaI American hero.<br> Is that your reading of it?<br> AbsoIuteIy. However,<br> remember, every situation is different.<br> And the actions of<br> the piIots on SouthJet 227<br> wiII be heaviIy scrutinized.<br> Are you suggesting that there may be<br> more to this than meets the eye?<br> There aIways is.<br> You don't have aII the answers.<br> You do have a Iot of questions.<br> We're gonna have to wait untiI some<br> of those answers come in<br> before we can say much more.<br> Are you hinting here,<br> I don't want to put words in your mouth,<br> but are you hinting<br> that this is suspicious?<br> This accident is not<br> Iike any other accident.<br> And the next one will be<br> Taylor Street.<br> What the fuck, Nicole?<br> Get out!<br> The guy in unit 1<br> just told me you stayed here last night!<br> Franny, just relax.<br> l just want to get my shit out of here.<br> What about my rent?<br> You owe me money, bitch!<br> Don't touch me, Franny!<br> Fran, get off me.<br> Fran, get your hand off me!<br> What the fuck are you doing?<br> Get the fuck off her!<br> Keep your fucking hands off her!<br> You okay?<br> ls this all the rest of your stuff?<br> Yeah.<br> She still owes me $1 ,1 00!<br> -Plus damages!<br> -Shut up!<br> What, you want to sue her?<br> Spend 1 ,000 bucks, or you want to<br> make a cash deal with me?<br> Make up your mind.<br> Make up your mind!<br> l'll take 700 cash.<br> You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?<br> Some baseball bat bullshit.<br> Seven hundred, my ass.<br> There's 400 cash.<br> Now be a good boy,<br> grab that box and put it in her car.<br> My car, it don't run.<br> lt didn't start this morning.<br> l'm taking all this with me.<br> Your car doesn't run?<br> Well, what were you going to do?<br> Why...<br> l don't know what l was gonna do.<br> What's your name?<br> Whip.<br> What?<br> That's funny?<br> Thank you,<br> Captain Whip.<br> Hey.<br> You okay?<br> -Yeah. You?<br> -Yeah.<br> -You want a drink?<br> -No, thanks.<br> You sure it's all right that l stay here?<br> Yes, it's all right that you stay here.<br> l want you to stay.<br> That knee hurting you?<br> Yes, it is.

Thank you, Doctor.<br> -lt's throbbing a little bit.<br> -Yeah.<br> The blood's having<br> a hard time getting back to your heart.<br> Feels good, though.<br> You going to shoot me?<br> Or can l come inside?<br> Yeah, come on inside.<br> l'll shoot you inside.<br> Listen, l thought we'd take a ride.<br> There's something l need to show you.<br> Okay.<br> There it is.<br> You can see on initial impact,<br> the left wing hit the ground.<br> Think if it would have<br> sheared off completely,<br> everybody would have<br> walked away from this plane.<br> The wing snapped off<br> and drove the engine cowling into<br> -the rear fuselage.<br> -Yeah.<br> lf you were sitting<br> in the last six or seven rows,<br> it was like being hit by a train.<br> Who are they?<br> The John the Baptist<br> Pentecostal Mission.<br> They helped pull survivors<br> out of the wreckage.<br> Now, they come out here every day.<br> And that is Ellen Block.<br> She's the head<br> of the NTSB investigation.<br> She's the one that's gonna be asking<br> you the tough questions.<br> l drank the night before the flight.<br> l drank that morning, too.<br> l used cocaine to help<br> straighten myself out.<br> l know. lt's in the toxicology report.<br> But that is<br> not the reason why this happened.<br> No, it's not.<br> Listen.<br> Clearly, there was a mechanical issue<br> with the plane.<br> Yeah, clearly.<br> Yeah, but what you and l know,<br> this was an act of God.<br> And l'm going to fight to get<br> the NTSB to add "Act of God"<br> as one of the probable causes.<br> Whose god would do this?<br> Okay.<br> So,<br> here's the deal.<br> Avington Carr, he's the owner<br> of the airline, he's on our side.<br> He's got big friends in Washington, too.<br> He wants to have a sit-down with us<br> tomorrow morning at 1 0:00.<br> -Good.<br> -Yeah.<br> You can't drink, Captain.<br> You're under the microscope right now.<br> You can't be seen buying liquor.<br> That means no bars, no drugs...<br> l understand.<br> l won't drink, l promise you.<br> -Look, we can get you help...<br> -l don't need help.<br> l won't drink, l promise you.<br> l can stop. On my own.<br> -Okay.<br> -Okay.<br> -Till 1 0:00.<br> -1 0:00, l got it.<br> Avington Carr.<br> l never wanted that fucking airline.<br> Neither did my brother.<br> lt was my father that wanted it.<br> -l like baseball.<br> -Oh, l like baseball.<br> Everybody in Georgia likes baseball.<br> The whole country likes baseball.<br> Cut the crap.<br> So, what's the deal, Lenny?<br> ls your union going to survive this one?<br> More importantly, how big a check<br> you think l'm gonna have to write?<br> You had six fatalities<br> on board your aircraft.<br> No, no, it's four, Lenny.<br> The two crew members don't count.<br> l don't mean they don't count.<br> They don't get settlements<br> like the passengers.<br> Okay, that's a workman's comp claim,<br> part of the union contract.<br> They do a dangerous job. They know it.<br> You the lawyer for the pilots' union?<br> No, sir, this is Hugh Lang,<br> he's the attorney we brought on<br> to handle the criminal side<br> of Captain Whitaker's situation.<br> Yes, and what is<br> Mr. Whitaker's situation?<br> The NTSB is up my ass<br> with a flashlight.<br> We had to give them<br> access to everything.<br> Everybody's curious<br> about Captain Whitaker.<br> Well, l flew with him<br> in the navy and he is a great pilot.<br> ls he a drunk?<br> He's a heavy drinker.<br> But maybe l should bring him in...<br> ln a minute.<br> All right, so let's get down to it, Lenny.<br> What does the union<br> plan to do about this blood test saying<br> Whitaker was high on booze and coke?<br> This guy's a real peach.<br> l'm going to kill the toxicology report.<br> The testing was done incompetently.<br> The toxicology equipment they used<br> was last calibrated in June of 2009.<br> lt's already 1 8 months past code.<br> Their log, that should clearly state<br> who labeled the blood vials,<br> and when, is very incomplete.<br> And they used<br> a preservative in the blood<br> that has been known<br> to cause fermentation,<br> and in some cases,<br> register higher in an alcohol test.<br> Now, l've done all this,<br> l've only been here a few days,<br> so l wouldn't worry about it<br> too much. l can handle this.<br> l like this guy, Lenny.<br> Makes me want to go out<br> and sniff a few lines and fly a jet.<br> Mr. Carr,<br> we're going to fight to push all the fault<br> onto the manufacturer,<br> Jackson Ridgefield.<br> And you think they're gonna just open<br> their checkbook and buy us all lunch?<br> Good fucking luck.<br> What's my exposure, Jim?<br> Well, the awards<br> to the families could kill the airline.<br> Fuck the airline.<br> The insurance companies<br> can have the goddamn airline.<br> l just don't want them<br> to come sniffing in my other pockets.<br> Speaking for the pilots' union, sir,<br> we don't want to see<br> your airline go away.<br> We enjoy the contract you have with us.<br> We're gonna protect Captain Whitaker,<br> and in turn, we're gonna<br> protect your airline.<br> Does Whitaker know he's going to jail?<br> My clients don't go to jail, Mr. Carr.<br> He's going to jail. He belongs in jail.<br> You bet your ass he's going to jail.<br> The only question is,<br> is he going to die in jail?<br> You're wrong, Mr. Carr.<br> Last time l checked,<br> six counts<br> of manslaughter is life in prison.<br> Life in prison.<br> What we in Georgia call "all day long."<br> l hear you're some kind of pilot.<br> To the 40, to the 50! And touchdown!<br> And Grandpa throws it, picks it up...<br> Oh, Grandpa, what,<br> are you going to chase him now?<br> Pick it up, Pop.<br> Pick it up.<br> Run it back! Run it back!<br> Come on, Knuckles!<br> Let me see you cut.<br> There she is, there she is.<br> You back... To the meet?<br> At the nice meeting.<br> l know, it's okay.<br> Yep. That shit ain't...<br> See?<br> This shit...<br> And my...<br> Knuckles, he's my boy.<br> He can play a game.<br> He can play that game.<br> You want to run the baII!<br> You want to be a quarterback!<br> Let me see you run it back!<br> Fake Dad out! Fake Grandpa out!<br> Oh, Dad, where'd you get that arm?<br> You must've got that<br> from Grandma's side.<br> There's a flight.<br> We're gonna miss the flight.<br> And he picks it up! TeII him, Dad.<br> When are we going to<br> go flying, Dad? Soon?<br> Soon.<br> You stiII want to get up there?<br> Sure. Any time, son.<br> AII right. Say hi, son.<br> AII right. Where's IittIe man KnuckIes?<br> What's up, KnuckIes?<br> Don't get shy.<br> Don't act Iike you don't know me.<br> I'm your father. Say, "Hi, Dad."<br> -Hi, Dad.<br> -What's your name?<br> WiII.<br> -What's your nickname?<br> -KnuckIes.<br> What are you gonna be<br> when you grow up?<br> -A piIot.<br> -There you go.<br> You taught him weII, Dad. A piIot.<br> Wait, wait, Iet me get that.<br> -Say hi to Mom.<br> -Hi, Mom.<br> What do you wanna teII Mom?<br> TeII her you Iove her.<br> I Iove her.<br> -Morning.<br> -Good morning.<br> You were in pretty bad shape last night.<br> Yeah.<br> Just tired. Oh!<br> l drank a little bit too much.<br> A bit?<br> What, you want to count<br> the fucking beers?<br> l threw them out.<br> They're in the garbage. Vodka, too.<br> That okay with you?<br> -More than okay.<br> -Good.<br> l've been watching the sky<br> change since the sunrise.<br> Beautiful.<br> l went out there,<br> l took some great shots.<br> lt's just so beautiful here.<br> You grow up here?<br> No. My dad did, though.<br> lt's my grandfather's farm.<br> Was.<br> Dad was a pilot.<br> He was 332nd Airborne.<br> He was Tuskegee.<br> Built that landing strip out there.<br> Crop dusting. EPA shut him down.<br> He traded in the crop duster<br> for the old Cessna<br> sitting out there in the barn.<br> Flew that damn thing all over the place.<br> He died.<br> l got a divorce and...<br> l've been trying to sell<br> the place ever since.<br> What about your mom?<br> Dead.<br> You? What about your dad?<br> Well, l'm pretty sure<br> he lives in Colorado.<br> Yeah?<br> No relationship?<br> lt was my mom that raised me.<br> She was incredible.<br> She held it together for so long,<br> l couldn't even tell how sick she was.<br> We spent those last<br> seven months together<br> like we were teenagers.<br> We'd trade stories<br> about boys and whatever.<br> She loved me.<br> My name's Trevor.<br> You saved my mom.<br> lt's great to see you, Whip.<br> lt's good to see you, too, Margaret.<br> The service was so nice.<br> l mean, all these people<br> who wanted to say goodbye.<br> Trina looked so beautiful in there.<br> Didn't you think so?<br> l mean, like she was just<br> going to wake up and smile.<br> l didn't go in. l... l just couldn't.<br> Trevor, find Daddy, baby.<br> He's over there by Mr. Benton.<br> You really should come<br> to the counseling group.<br> The union has great people<br> for us to talk to.<br> l can't. Really. l...<br> l will.<br> Well...<br> -You take care, okay, Whip?<br> -Okay.<br> Listen, Margaret.<br> You know l'm in the middle of this<br> investigation. The NTSB<br> is investigating the crash.<br> Yeah. l'm gonna talk to them next week.<br> Yeah. Well, l'm... l'm a little nervous<br> because l was out the night<br> before the crash, at dinner.<br> Yeah. With Trina.<br> Right. And l had two glasses of wine,<br> and they're probably going to ask you<br> about my condition that morning,<br> or whether you thought<br> l had anything to drink.<br> What?<br> l've known you 1 1 years, Whip.<br> Right.<br> You want to tell me that<br> you and Trina went to dinner<br> -and you had two glasses of wine?<br> -No.<br> Sounds like a nice restaurant.<br> Now, which one was it?<br> You have to say that it was<br> an ordinary day, Margaret.<br> l mean, it was an ordinary day.<br> You know me. l was in shape to fly.<br> You have a problem with saying that?<br> lt's a lie, Whip.<br> lt's a lie. Trina told me<br> you two hadn't been to sleep.<br> Well, my lack of sleep had nothing to do<br> with that plane falling apart, Margaret.<br> l'm just trying to get this thing straight.<br> Now you think any other pilot could have<br> landed that plane and saved more lives?<br> l didn't say that, Whip.<br> l can't imagine another...<br> All right, then.<br> Well, imagine your son,<br> Trevor, in this church,<br> looking at you in that box.<br> Or my son visiting me in prison. And...<br> -Please, Whip, enough. Enough, Whip.<br> -And for the next 40 years...<br> Don't you think we've all had enough?<br> l need this, Margaret.<br> What do you want me to say?<br> l just...<br> lt was an ordinary day.<br> The storm, after we took off,<br> was very severe.<br> But as far as<br> the flight crew was concerned,<br> it was a perfectly ordinary day.<br> -Hey.<br> -Hi.<br> You okay?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> So?<br> Well, l got through my first day.<br> They didn't fire me.<br> -So...<br> -Good. Good.<br> And they need someone to work<br> the night shift and they asked me.<br> lt's time and a half, so...<br> l got a vest.<br> -And a little name tag.<br> -Nice.<br> l got you something.<br> -Yeah?<br> -Yeah.<br> lt's a P-51 Mustang.<br> l know it's a P-51 ...<br> Your daddy fly one of those?<br> Yes, he did.<br> lt's cause for celebration.<br> Oh, well, l promised Sheila that<br> l'd go to this AA meeting now.<br> She's my sponsor,<br> the one that's been helping me.<br> Can we celebrate tomorrow night?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, sure, come on.<br> You know, you could come with me.<br> To the meeting.<br> lt's an open meeting,<br> meaning that anyone can come.<br> Even you.<br> So the cops got a flashIight<br> on me behind the dumpster.<br> I'm wearing nothing<br> but my girlfriend's panties,<br> I got vomit aII down<br> the front of my chest.<br> And I say to them,<br> "I might have had two beers."<br> So that's how<br> I got the nickname "Two Beer Barry."<br> I'm getting the stink eye<br> from Ed over here.<br> Have I gone off format?<br> My name is Barry and I am an aIcohoIic.<br> Hi, Barry.<br> Are there any other aIcohoIics present?<br> I aIways Iove a meeting where we<br> aII have to identify at the top,<br> because it forces me<br> to be honest about who I reaIIy am.<br> And I never toId the truth<br> out there, obviousIy.<br> I Iied about everything.<br> I was taught in these rooms<br> that I wouId never get sober<br> if I kept Iying,<br> but that's what I was best at.<br> If I knew anything<br> in this world it was how to Iie,<br> especiaIIy about my drinking.<br> But, whatever.

We've won.<br> Yeah, this is what we call,<br> in my profession, a "walk over."<br> Yeah, they scheduled a hearing,<br> it's 1 0 days away.<br> They can be tough,<br> but you just gotta be sharp.<br> Stay focused.<br> Answer the questions correctly.<br> That's right, but we're good.<br> All right,<br> l've successfully had an "Act of God"<br> added to the NTSB's<br> list of probable causes.<br> We've shifted suspicion away from you.<br> lt's no longer a question<br> of your condition,<br> but the condition of the plane.<br> Fantastic. That's what l've been<br> trying to tell everybody.<br> This is a broken plane.<br> That's right.<br> What about my toxicology report?<br> Oh, l killed that.<br> There is no physical proof<br> that you were intoxicated on that plane,<br> and no eyewitnesses.<br> So why are we here? We're good.<br> Because there is a small problem.<br> Because of turbulence,<br> there was no drink service on the flight,<br> but they did find two empty<br> vodka bottles in the galley trash.<br> Yeah...<br> And there's no physical<br> evidence on the bottles.<br> No DNA, no fingerprints<br> to link them to anyone,<br> but they were uncapped and empty.<br> And the only people<br> who would have had access<br> to those bottles would be the flight crew.<br> Now, Margaret,<br> Evans and Camelia Satou,<br> they all had clean tox reports,<br> so that only leaves you and...<br> -Trina Marquez.<br> -Right, Trina Marquez.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, l see where we're going here.<br> That's funny, though, you know,<br> they only found two bottles.<br> -Why is that?<br> -l drank three.<br> One's missing.<br> You know, when l first met you,<br> l couldn't believe what a drunk,<br> arrogant scumbag you were.<br> -Oh, really?<br> -Yeah.<br> Oh, thank you, Hugh.<br> But l did the research,<br> Captain Whitaker.<br> l heard the expert analysis,<br> and l got to tell you,<br> l'm in awe of what you did.<br> The FAA and the NTSB took 1 0 pilots,<br> placed them in simulators,<br> re-created the events that led<br> to this plane falling out of the sky.<br> Do you know how many of them<br> were able to safely land the planes?<br> Not one.<br> Every pilot crashed the aircraft,<br> killed everybody on board.<br> You were the only one who could do it.<br> Great.<br> l'm going home.<br> -Hey, wait, Whip. You can't...<br> -Captain Whitaker,<br> l'm telling you right now,<br> you walk away...<br> -Listen, man.<br> -...you're going to prison.<br> l'm trying to save your fucking life.<br> What fucking life?<br> Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh.<br> Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing<br> is a federal agency hearing.<br> Do you understand that?<br> Yes, l understand that.<br> Okay. Well, we can't play<br> around with these people.<br> Now, we walk in there<br> like this, with this, we're done.<br> Everything we've done<br> goes right out the window.<br> l have no more moves, all right?<br> lt's all on you right now.<br> Okay. Charlie,<br> just get him to the church on time.<br> Yeah, get him to the church on time!<br> Yeah, Charlie,<br> just keep him nice and sober,<br> so he can save your fucking union!<br> Listen, Whip...<br> And that fat fuck's airline!<br> Fuck you, Charlie! Fuck you!<br> lt's him. Yeah, it's him, all right.<br> How you doing?<br> What are you doing here?<br> lt's good to see you, too, Deana.<br> May l come in?<br> l just thought l'd come by<br> and see how you and Will are doing.<br> Will! Knuckles!<br> We hadn't talked in a while,<br> and this whole thing happened.<br> l just thought l'd come by<br> and we could talk.<br> You know that l prefer that you call us.<br> -Right, right.<br> -Yeah.<br> Yeah, call you. But l mean,<br> it's not like anybody<br> around here calls me,<br> in the last three years,<br> other than to ask for some money.<br> Have you been drinking?<br> Well, that didn't take long, did it?<br> Seventeen seconds. Yeah.<br> Exactly 1 7 seconds.<br> -Ladies and gentlemen...<br> -l'm gonna ask you just to leave.<br> lt took exactly 1 7 seconds<br> for my ex-wife,<br> Deana Coleman,<br> to ask me if l was drinking.<br> -Just leave, Will.<br> -What, is that a world record?<br> Leave the house that l paid for?<br> That's what you want me to do?<br> l'm calling the police.<br> Call the police.<br> l'm telling you to leave.<br> Will Whitaker, Junior!<br> How you doing, son?<br> Man of the house.<br> Thanks for calling me back.<br> l'm telling you to leave.<br> Are you?<br> You're the man of the house now?<br> You upset my mother. You gotta go.<br> Well, l'm your father, tough guy.<br> You're a drunk.<br> Get off!<br> l'm a drunk. You don't know<br> who the fuck l am.<br> l sure don't! Why don't you tell me?<br> What?<br> Who the fuck are you? Who are you?<br> Get the fuck out!<br> Get the fuck out, man!<br> Whip, stop it! Stop it! Stop it!<br> l love you, son.<br> Get the fuck out!<br> Stop it!

You paid for it.<br> He's going to need it later.<br> My work here is finished.<br> See y'all on the dark side of the moon.<br> Your nose.<br> l'll go ahead and tell them we're here.<br> You're going to make it.<br> Remember, if they<br> ask you anything about your drinking,<br> it's totally acceptable<br> to say, "l don't recall."<br> Hey, don't tell me<br> how to lie about my drinking, okay?<br> l know how to lie about my drinking.<br> l've been lying about<br> my drinking my whole life.<br> Those are difficult images to watch.<br> For the record, l'm Ellen Block,<br> hearing officer for this hearing.<br> Captain Whitaker, good morning.<br> Morning.<br> What that video captures is that<br> the aircraft<br> was in a relatively stable glide<br> just prior to the moment of impact.<br> However, according to<br> the data we retrieved<br> from the cockpit data recorders,<br> at exactly 9:34,<br> after flying 27 minutes without incident,<br> the transponder recorded<br> a loss in altitude<br> in excess of 4,800 feet per minute<br> in what is considered<br> a "full pitch nose down" attitude.<br> Then, at 9:42,<br> according to the data recorders,<br> a decision was made<br> to invert the aircraft.<br> The NTSB has created<br> an animated simulation<br> that l would like to play at this point.<br> We're going to roII it.<br> What do you mean "RoII it"?<br> We gotta do something to stop this dive.<br> Margaret, what's your son's name?<br> -Trevor.<br> -Say, "I Iove you, Trevor."<br> -What?<br> -BIack box.<br> Say, "I Iove you, Trevor."<br> I Iove you, Trevor.<br> You be a good boy. Mommy Ioves you.<br> Okay, here we go. I've got controI.<br> Oh, Lord Jesus!<br> -...flaps.<br> -FIaps!<br> -Speed brakes.<br> -Speed brakes!<br> Margaret! Power!<br> -Gear up.<br> -Gear up!<br> Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!<br> We're flying. We're IeveI.<br> We can maintain aItitude Iike...<br> AtIanta Center... SouthJet... 7.<br> We are inverted.<br> I... We are inverted.<br> SouthJet 2... 7, did you say inverted?<br> That audio is tragic and compelling.<br> l chose to play that part<br> of the cockpit recording<br> to highlight a key moment<br> on board flight 227,<br> wherein you say, "We're going to roll it.<br> "Here we go. l've got control."<br> You made a very conscious decision<br> to invert the aircraft,<br> to roll the plane upside down,<br> is that correct?<br> l'm not sure if it was conscious. But...<br> lt was more like instinct.<br> What led to that decision?<br> l don't recall.<br> Let me quote from<br> an investigative summary.<br> "From 9:34 until 9:42,<br> "the events on the aircraft are,"<br> again l quote,<br> "bold and remarkable.<br> "By inverting the plane,<br> Captain Whitaker arrested the descent<br> "and allowed the aircraft to level off,<br> "enabling him to glide the aircraft<br> away from any populated areas<br> "and allowing him to execute<br> a forced landing in an open field."<br> l heard a loud metallic bang.<br> We pitched nose down.<br> -No control.<br> -Yes.<br> First Officer Evans'<br> testimony confirms the same.<br> l want to show you something.<br> Nothing's happening.<br> This remote isn't working.<br> Apologies. l can do this manually.<br> This is the jackscrew<br> on the tail assembly<br> that articulates the horizontal stabilizer,<br> also known as the elevator.<br> As you can see,<br> the threads on this screw<br> are almost entirely gone.<br> This part was suggested as<br> a maintenance replacement<br> in January of 201 1 .<br> lt was never replaced.<br> lt had an additional<br> lt finally failed.<br> Our investigators have concluded<br> that the jackscrew snapped<br> and the elevator was frozen<br> in a fixed position,<br> locking the elevator in a down position,<br> which forced the plane into a dive.<br> The loss of the elevator was,<br> and l quote our report,<br> "A catastrophic event<br> from which recovery was improbable<br> "and stable flight impossible."<br> Mr. Whitaker,<br> l want to talk about the days leading<br> and the hours leading<br> up to the accident.<br> But before l do,<br> l want to remind you<br> that you are under oath<br> and that any testimony<br> you give here today<br> will be considered admissible<br> in any subsequent hearings<br> or criminal proceedings.<br> Do you understand what that means?<br> Captain Whitaker, for the record,<br> l need you to verbalize your answer.<br> l'm sorry. Yes, l understand.<br> On the three days<br> leading up to the accident,<br> Tuesday, October 1 1th,<br> Wednesday, October 1 2th<br> or Thursday, October 1 3th,<br> did you consume any alcohol<br> or other intoxicating elements?<br> No, l did not.<br> On the morning of the accident,<br> Friday, October 14th,<br> did you consume any alcohol<br> or ingest any chemicals or drugs<br> that may have impaired<br> your ability to perform yourjob?<br> No, l did not.<br> Mr. Whitaker, do you now<br> or have you ever had<br> a problem with alcohol dependency,<br> alcoholism or drug addiction?<br> No.<br> Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about done.<br> Due to the severe turbulence<br> in the early part of the flight,<br> you asked the flight crew to suspend<br> the beverage service<br> on the plane, is that correct?<br> Yes, that's correct.<br> l suspended<br> the drink service on the plane.<br> Are you aware that<br> our investigators found<br> two single service vodka bottles<br> in the galley trash bin?<br> Yes, l'm aware of that.<br> There were five crew members on board<br> that would have had access<br> to the beverage trolley.<br> Less than an hour after the accident,<br> blood was taken from each<br> of these crew members,<br> yourself, First Officer Evans,<br> Flight Attendant Margaret Thomason,<br> and posthumously from Camelia Satou<br> and Katerina Marquez.<br> Toxicology analysis was performed and<br> three of these tests came back negative,<br> one was disqualified<br> for technical reasons,<br> and one tested positive for alcohol.<br> lt registered a .1 7 blood alcohol level.<br> Are you aware of that?<br> Yeah, l'm aware of it now.<br> Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,<br> but you knew her outside of work,<br> is that correct?<br> Outside of work?<br> No, not really.<br> Did you know Miss Marquez<br> had a drinking problem?<br> No, l did not.<br> Did you ever see her drink to excess?<br> No, l did not.<br> Were you aware that she was<br> twice treated for alcohol addiction?<br> The last time was 1 6 months ago<br> and paid for by SouthJet Airlines.<br> No, l did not.<br> ls it your opinion<br> that Katerina Marquez<br> drank on that flight?<br> Could you repeat the question?<br> ls it your opinion that Katerina Marquez<br> drank on that flight?<br> l'm sorry, my what?<br> Your opinion, Captain.<br> Since her toxicology report<br> is the only toxicology report<br> that is admissible in this hearing,<br> and she in fact tested<br> positive for alcohol,<br> is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez<br> drank those two bottles<br> of vodka on the plane?<br> God help me.<br> l'm sorry, Mr. Whitaker,<br> l couldn't hear you. What did you say?<br> l said, "God help me."<br> Yes, well, however, is it your opinion...<br> lt's my opinion<br> Trina did not drink that vodka.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?<br> She saved the boy's life, that's...<br> Could you speak louder,<br> Captain Whitaker?<br> Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka<br> because l drank the vodka.<br> What the hell? Objection!<br> Please be seated, sir. Sir.<br> Captain Whitaker misspoke.<br> l drank the vodka bottles.<br> Didn't you hear me? l said l object!<br> Please be seated, sir.<br> This is not a courtroom.<br> Well, l object anyway!<br> l drank the vodka bottles on the plane.<br> Captain Whitaker,<br> on the three nights<br> before the accident, October 1 1th...<br> October 1 1th, October 1 2th,<br> and 1 3th and 14th, l was intoxicated.<br> l drank all of those days. l drank.<br> ln excess.<br> On the morning of the accident...<br> l was drunk.<br> l'm drunk now.<br> l'm drunk right now, Miss Block.<br> Because l'm an alcoholic.<br> That was it.<br> l was finished.<br> l was done.<br> lt was as if l had reached<br> my lifelong limit<br> of lies.<br> l could not tell one more lie.<br> And maybe l'm a sucker,<br> 'cause if l had told just one more lie,<br> l could have walked away<br> from all that mess<br> and kept my wings,<br> kept my false sense of pride.<br> And more importantly,<br> l could have avoided being locked up<br> in here with all you<br> nice folks for the last 1 3 months.<br> But l'm here.<br> And l'll be here<br> for at least the next four or five years.<br> And that's fair.<br> l betrayed the public trust. l did.<br> That's how the judge explained it to me.<br> l had betrayed the public trust.<br> The FAA, they took away<br> my pilot's license.<br> And that's fair.<br> My chances<br> of ever flying again are slim to none.<br> And l accept that.<br> l've had a lot of time<br> to think about it, all of it.<br> l've been doing some writing.<br> l wrote letters to each of the families<br> that had lost loved ones.<br> Some of them were able<br> to hear my apology.<br> Some of them never will.<br> l also apologized to<br> all the people<br> that tried to help me along the way, but l<br> couldn't or wouldn't listen.<br> People like my wife, you know.<br> My ex-wife and<br> my son.<br> And again, like l said,<br> you know, some of them will<br> never forgive me. Some of them will.<br> But at least l'm sober.<br> l thank God for that. l'm grateful for that.<br> And this is going to sound real stupid<br> coming from a man<br> who's locked up in prison,<br> but for the first time in my life,<br> l'm free.<br> Whitaker. You got a visitor.<br> -You got 40 minutes.<br> -Okay.<br> Look at you, boy.<br> -How are you doing?<br> -l'm good.<br> You look good.<br> Come on, sit down.<br> This is a surprise.<br> You get that gift l sent you?<br> Yeah, yeah, l got it.<br> -Yeah? You like it?<br> -Yeah.<br> Good.<br> How's your mom?<br> Oh. She's all right.<br> My college counselor<br> wanted me to come and interview you.<br> Me?<br> Yeah. l'm writing essays<br> for college applications.<br> Good.<br> l need your help.<br> You got it.<br> Well, this essay, the essay<br> that l have to write...<br> lt's called "The Most Fascinating Person<br> "That l've Never Met."<br> Okay.<br> So...<br> Who are you?<br> That's a good question.<br>
