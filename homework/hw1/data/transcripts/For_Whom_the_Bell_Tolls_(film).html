                        Roberto!<br> You promised.<br> - Adios, Kashkin.<br> - Adios, Roberto.<br> Oh, hola, Americano.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hola, amigo.<br> Get back!<br> - Help yourself, Jordan.<br> - General Golz!<br> What an accent.<br> He even knows me<br> in the dark.<br> That's all we have in Spain now:<br> Accents. Eh, Jordan?<br> Yes, I was looking for you<br> when the lights went out.<br> I saw you.<br> How did it go? The train.<br> - All right.<br> - Mm-hmm. And, uh, Kashkin?<br> - He caught one.<br> - Huh?<br> - He didn't want to be taken alive.<br> - Oh.<br> - So it was like that.<br> - Yes. Murder.<br> - Orders are orders.<br> - I still say it was murder.<br> Well, in this business,<br> Jordan, remember nothing.<br> Nothing except<br> the next job.<br> - What's next?<br> - A bridge.<br> - Oh, a bridge.<br> - Right. To blow the bridge is nothing.<br> But to blow it at the stated hour<br> and the time set for the attack,<br> that's a horse of another color,<br> as you Americans say.<br> - Attack?<br> - Yes. At last we take the offensive.<br> Oh, it will be beautiful attack.<br> On paper it looks wonderful.<br> And if it succeeds...<br> No, I will not say "if."<br> This time, it must succeed,<br> and it will.<br> What I've told you,<br> Jordan,<br> is known only to<br> the General's staff.<br> Our only chance to succeed<br> is by a surprise attack.<br> Now, here's the bridge,<br> over a deep gorge.<br> It's the only way the enemy<br> can bring up reinforcements.<br> Tanks, artillery, troops...<br> all must come over this bridge.<br> I must know absolutely<br> it is gone.<br> Not before the attack.<br> They'd rebuild it.<br> It must go the minute the attack starts.<br> No sooner, no later.<br> So, the bridge is nothing.<br> But suppose their soldiers are sitting<br> on it when it's time to blow it.<br> You know, sentries on both ends.<br> What do you do then?<br> In our country, General, they say<br> never blow a bridge 'til you come to it.<br> Good.<br> That's good.<br> You joke. In this business,<br> one should joke a little.<br> I am so serious.<br> It's why I can joke.<br> - You think you can get through<br> the enemy lines tomorrow night?<br> - Sure.<br> Good. That will give you three days<br> to prepare for the dynamiting.<br> Wait for the attack at dawn,<br> after the third night.<br> Mm-hmm. How will I know<br> the exact time?<br> Well, use these. Listen.<br> First, we attack from the air.<br> When our planes fly over, you'll hear<br> the explosions. That's your time.<br> Oh, uh, I've got a good guide for you:<br> An old man named Anselmo.<br> But good. Knows the country like a fox,<br> and, uh, the people to help you.<br> Now go and find yourself<br> a pretty girl.<br> - But first, get a haircut.<br> - Is that an order, General?<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't like your barber.<br> Up the gorge to the left<br> is the bridge.<br> - Sentry boxes, huh?<br> - At each end, Roberto.<br> Always two sentries<br> on guard.<br> Where do<br> the sentries live?<br> At the roadmender's hut,<br> across the bridge.<br> You can't see it<br> from here.<br> The other post is on this side,<br> in that old sawmill.<br> - How many men at the sawmill?<br> - Eight and the corporal.<br> The other post...<br> how many men?<br> Maybe more.<br> We'll find out. Look!<br> They always spit<br> in the gorge.<br> It brings luck.<br> I wish I could<br> spit that far.<br> - Roberto.<br> - Hmm?<br> That sentry... He looks like<br> a man from my village.<br> He's very young.<br> He must die?<br> You couldn't do it,<br> Anselmo?<br> I would kill<br> the sentry, yes,<br> considering the necessity<br> of the bridge.<br> But if I live later,<br> I'll try to live in such a way,<br> doing no harm to anyone,<br> that it will be forgiven.<br> Come on. Let's get this dynamite<br> where it'll be safe.<br> - You wait here, Roberto.<br> - Oh, I can make it, Anselmo.<br> You want to be shot at<br> carrying these?<br> No, not even in a joke.<br> Go ahead.<br> Roberto.<br> He's the boss here, Roberto.<br> Very strong man.<br> - I can see.<br> - Foreigner.<br> And a friend.<br> Didn't the old man tell you?<br> I'm asking you.<br> I'm here for the republic.<br> You know those seals, don't you?<br> S.I.M.,<br> Service of Military Intelligence.<br> This is the seal of the General's staff.<br> They command for the republic.<br> In these mountains,<br> I command. No one else.<br> - What's that?<br> - Dynamite.<br> Good.<br> I can use dynamite.<br> - How much you bring me?<br> - None.<br> - What's your name?<br> - What's that to you?<br> Pablo.<br> He's Pablo.<br> - What for?<br> - A bridge.<br> - What bridge?<br> - That's my business.<br> - In this country, foreigner,<br> it's my business.<br> - Is that the way to talk?<br> - Do you want to die?<br> - No.<br> - Shut your mouth.<br> - But didn't you hear<br> what this comrade said?<br> - He comes for the republic!<br> - Anselmo.<br> Help us get this stuff up to your camp,<br> will you? The old man's tired.<br> Hola.<br> What is it that comes?<br> The old man<br> and the dynamiter.<br> Hey, that, that stuff.<br> Not in the cave.<br> - What are you making?<br> - A trap for foxes.<br> See? Very practical.<br> He catches rabbits. If a gypsy<br> catches rabbits, he says it's foxes.<br> If he catches a fox,<br> he would call it an elephant.<br> - And if I catch an elephant?<br> - You'd say it was a tank.<br> I'll get me a tank, old man.<br> Someday I'll get me a tank,<br> and you can call it what you please.<br> Gypsies talk much,<br> kill little.<br> - I'm going for wine.<br> - Bring a cup for me.<br> - Hey, you have wine, huh?<br> - And plenty of it.<br> - We eat like generals here.<br> - He eats like ten generals.<br> - What do gypsies do in the war?<br> - They keep on being gypsies.<br> - Well, that's a good job.<br> - The best.<br> - How do they call you?<br> - Roberto. And you?<br> Rafael. Oh, wine!<br> - There will be food soon.<br> - Food!<br> You have tobacco, huh?<br> Yeah. I know these.<br> Much air and little tobacco.<br> Ah, we eat!<br> - Hola.<br> - Hola.<br> That's the way I comb it.<br> Go ahead and eat.<br> Hey. Bread.<br> How are you called?<br> Maria.<br> And you?<br> Roberto.<br> Been here long?<br> This long.<br> Three months.<br> They shaved my head<br> in Valladolid.<br> I was on the train.<br> They were taking me south.<br> - The train Pablo blew at Talavera.<br> - Yeah.<br> Many of the prisoners were<br> caught again, but they saved me.<br> They and Pilar.<br> We found her hiding<br> in the rock...<br> where she'd run<br> from the train.<br> You should have seen her<br> when we brought her here.<br> No hair at all!<br> Cried all the time,<br> and if anyone touch her,<br> she'd shiver<br> like a wet dog.<br> Man, but she was ugly.<br> God's truth, Roberto,<br> though gypsies usually lie.<br> She looked like<br> a half-drowned kitten.<br> Hey.<br> - You blow trains?<br> - I have.<br> - Here?<br> - No, in Estremadura.<br> In another six months,<br> it'll grow out.<br> Are you, uh, his woman?<br> Pablo's?<br> You've seen Pablo.<br> - I've seen Rafael too.<br> - No.<br> No, not the gypsy.<br> This is a very strange woman, Roberto.<br> Is of no one.<br> But she cooks well.<br> Really? No one?<br> No one.<br> No one.<br> Nor of you, either.<br> No.<br> No, I have no time for women.<br> No?<br> Maria. Maria!<br> Who's that?<br> Pablo's woman,<br> Pilar.<br> She's something barbarous,<br> but brave! Wah!<br> - Hundred times braver than Pablo.<br> - Pablo was brave in the beginning.<br> Sure. He killed more people<br> than the cholera.<br> At the start of the movement, he killed<br> more people than the bubonic plague.<br> But Pilar...<br> she's something barbarous!<br> - Mmm!<br> - Gypsy's afraid of her.<br> Why not? She has<br> a strong hatred for me.<br> - Why?<br> - She treats me as a time waster.<br> - She doesn't like gypsies.<br> - What an injustice.<br> She has gypsy blood herself.<br> She knows of what she speaks.<br> But she has a tongue.<br> It bites like a bull whip!<br> What are you saying now,<br> you lazy, unspeakable son<br> of an unmentionable gypsy?<br> Answer me, gypsy.<br> I was telling this comrade<br> what a kind woman you are, Pilar.<br> - Liar!<br> - This one comes as a dynamiter.<br> I know that. Relieve Andres.<br> He's on guard at the top.<br> I go, Pilar. I go.<br> I'll see you, Roberto,<br> at the hour of eating.<br> Not even in a joke!<br> Three times today you've eaten.<br> - And I can eat twice more.<br> - Get out of here.<br> - And send me Andres.<br> - Eh.<br> - Hola, Ingles. How are you,<br> and how's everything in the republic?<br> - Good.<br> - Both good.<br> - I'm happy.<br> What was that gypsy<br> saying about me?<br> He said you were much woman.<br> And I'd say he's right.<br> And what were you saying<br> to the girl before I came out?<br> - Mmm, nothing.<br> - I saw how she was from seeing you.<br> - I only joked with her.<br> - Jokes.<br> Listen to me, Ingles.<br> She's young.<br> Not hardened as we are.<br> And she's had a bad time, the worst time<br> a woman can have, you understand?<br> - Yes, I guess so.<br> - I'm worried about her.<br> When do you leave here?<br> In three days...<br> if I'm still alive.<br> What made you say that?<br> That way of speaking never brings luck.<br> Let me see your hand.<br> Well?<br> Nothing.<br> I saw nothing.<br> What you come for?<br> Blow another train?<br> No, a bridge.<br> All the better.<br> Now we have causes.<br> Let's blow all the bridges and get out.<br> I'm sick of this place.<br> We are all rotting here<br> because there is no fighting.<br> Nothing to do but<br> watch Pablo get drunk.<br> This life is ruining him.<br> - Tell me, what did you see in my hand?<br> - I saw nothing.<br> Yes, you did.<br> I'm only curious, Pilar.<br> I don't believe in such things.<br> - In what do you believe?<br> - In my work.<br> - I saw that.<br> - What else?<br> Nothing else. A bridge<br> is very difficult, you said.<br> - No, I said it was important.<br> - But it can be very difficult.<br> Yes. I'm going back there<br> to look it over again.<br> - How many men have you got here?<br> - Five that are good.<br> The gypsy's worthless,<br> although his intentions are good.<br> Pablo I no longer trust.<br> Thanks. I like<br> your way of speaking.<br> I try to speak frankly.<br> - Then tell me what you saw in my hand.<br> - No.<br> I saw nothing else.<br> Go now to the bridge.<br> I look after your equipment.<br> Let me tell you again, Ingles.<br> I'm glad you've come.<br> We will understand each other.<br> Are they not well outside?<br> I don't want dynamite in here.<br> We have fire.<br> It's far from the fire.<br> Smoke?<br> How goes it, gypsy?<br> - Is she gonna let you eat again?<br> - Why not?<br> Is there wine?<br> Not much left.<br> Well, in that case,<br> I'll have a cup of water.<br> Maria, is there any water left?<br> It's too strong<br> or I'd give you some.<br> I'd offer it to you, Pablo,<br> but there's not much left.<br> - I have wine.<br> - What drink is that?<br> Medicine.<br> Wanna taste it?<br> - What's it for?<br> - It changes your ideas.<br> Yeah?<br> Bitter as gall!<br> I'd rather be sick<br> than have that medicine.<br> That's the wormwood. I'm glad you don't<br> like it because there's not much left.<br> What are you saying there?<br> I was explaining<br> the medicine.<br> Maria.<br> - What's that?<br> - The bridge.<br> Showing the construction.<br> Look how it seems.<br> Why, that's<br> the bridge itself.<br> - How do you blow up bridge?<br> - That's what I'm figuring out.<br> No!<br> I don't go<br> for the bridge.<br> Neither me nor my people.<br> Then we'll do it alone.<br> Old one?<br> Yes.<br> Without this coward.<br> Hey, you.<br> What did you say?<br> Nothing for you.<br> I spoke to Roberto.<br> My orders are<br> to blow the bridge.<br> And I say no.<br> In these mountains, we hide.<br> My business is to take care of<br> my people, and I-I know my business.<br> Live one place.<br> Fight somewhere else.<br> Fight, raid, blow trains, bridges,<br> but a way off.<br> Not here where<br> they will hunt us.<br> You'll clear out. Get away<br> to the Gredos. You've got horses.<br> I have five horses<br> and eight people!<br> You and the old man<br> with the loud mouth make ten.<br> Now if this bridge is blown,<br> we will be hunted.<br> Hunted from the earth,<br> from the air.<br> Yeah. Explosions<br> will fall from the sky...<br> on my horses.<br> Until you had horses,<br> you were one of us.<br> Now you're rich with horses.<br> You want to retire.<br> A lie. You no expose the horses<br> for the cause.<br> To eat well, yes.<br> To steal, yes.<br> To murder, yes.<br> To fight for the republic, no.<br> You're an old man who will<br> make trouble with his mouth.<br> I'm an old man<br> not afraid to fight.<br> I'm an old man<br> without horses.<br> You're an old man<br> who might not live long.<br> I'm an old man<br> who will live until I die.<br> You will blow<br> no bridge here.<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> No bridge.<br> Pilar.<br> - What do you say?<br> - I am for the bridge.<br> And for the republic.<br> What's that, woman?<br> I am for the bridge<br> and against you, nothing more.<br> What you say, Primitivo?<br> I am also for the bridge.<br> - Fernando?<br> - To me, the bridge means nothing.<br> I'm for the woman of Pablo.<br> - Andres?<br> - Yes, equally.<br> The same, Pilar.<br> Then we blow the bridge and retreat<br> to the Gredos afterwards.<br> You with your head of a bull<br> and your heart of a hog.<br> You think there will be<br> any afterwards from this bridge?<br> I am for the republic,<br> and the republic is a bridge.<br> It means nothing, huh? Nothing,<br> then, to be hunted like a beast...<br> after this thing<br> which brings no profit.<br> Everyone to die for it?<br> Don't try to<br> frighten us, coward.<br> Coward? Is it cowardly<br> to know what's foolish?<br> Or am I a leader<br> for nothing?<br> Haven't I brought you all alive<br> through a year of this war?<br> This foreigner comes here to do a thing<br> for the good of the foreigners.<br> And for his good,<br> you want to sacrifice us.<br> I'm for the good<br> and safety of all.<br> Safety. Huh!<br> There is no such thing<br> as safety.<br> Did I spend nine years with<br> the worst-paid matadors of the world...<br> not to learn about fear<br> and about safety?<br> Speak to me of anything<br> but safety.<br> Look at him.<br> How I believed in him once.<br> And look what he is now.<br> From one year of war, you've<br> become lazy, a drunkard and a coward.<br> Woman, you have no right<br> to speak in that way,<br> not before my people<br> and the stranger.<br> Do you still believe<br> you command here?<br> Yes.<br> Here, I command.<br> Here, I command.<br> Haven't you heard them?<br> Here, no one commands<br> but me now.<br> I should shoot you<br> and the foreigner both.<br> Try it and see what happens.<br> Listen to me, drunkard.<br> You understand now who commands?<br> - Why, I command.<br> - No. Listen.<br> Take the wax<br> from your ears.<br> Listen well.<br> I command.<br> All right.<br> All right!<br> You command.<br> And if you want, he...<br> he can command too.<br> Maybe I am lazy<br> and drink too much.<br> Maybe you think<br> I'm a coward,<br> though you know better.<br> Maybe, but I'm not stupid.<br> Now if you're a woman as well as<br> a commander, show us something to eat.<br> Maria.<br> Take the food.<br> - You must be careful.<br> - Pablo?<br> If you sleep, yes.<br> I'll keep an eye open.<br> What's he doing?<br> Only drinking. There'll be danger<br> if he begins to hide the sadness.<br> If he pretends to be friendly,<br> it'll mean he's made a decision.<br> I heard Pilar say it.<br> What kind of decision?<br> Who knows? After what's happened,<br> it would mean great danger for you.<br> I'll look after myself.<br> I'm thinking about the bridge.<br> I'm thinking<br> about you, Roberto.<br> Why, Maria?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> Did I muss it?<br> All day I wanted you<br> to do that.<br> I, too, Maria.<br> Where is Pablo?<br> Aha. He's gone<br> to the horses.<br> Now you have to kill him. Why don't<br> you kill him before he kills you?<br> He won't kill me.<br> We waited for you to kill him.<br> Why didn't you?<br> And turn Pilar against me? Without<br> the woman, there's no control here.<br> So he takes the horses and goes.<br> What about your bridge then?<br> Ah, you don't know Pablo.<br> Now, man, you have<br> tightened your garters.<br> You, my friend.<br> You know I'm not a coward.<br> Yeah.<br> You are no woman,<br> no fool.<br> No.<br> Nor any colt<br> of a girl either...<br> that makes a man<br> crazy with hunger.<br> You don't lie, make insults<br> and leave me like my people.<br> Yes. Yes, eat.<br> Eat, my friend.<br> Pay no attention to the woman.<br> You know who commands.<br> You and me,<br> we'll show them who's stupid.<br> Not me.<br> Not you, my friend.<br> Get out of sight!<br> - Ours?<br> - German and Italian.<br> - Huh? Can they see the horses?<br> - They're not looking for horses.<br> Man, I could see their faces.<br> I spit in their faces.<br> I spit in the milk<br> of their mothers.<br> I tell you... I tell you<br> they could see the horses.<br> Wipe the sweat from your face.<br> They could see the cigarette butts.<br> Huh?<br> - Hey, wait! They may be back!<br> - Coward!<br> Go to your horses.<br> - Have you seen planes like this before?<br> - Never, Ingles.<br> Get inside.<br> I'm going with Pilar to the camp of<br> El Sordo. We've got to have more horses.<br> You know your sentry posts.<br> Keep a close watch.<br> Anselmo,<br> I want you to write down everything<br> that passes along the road.<br> I can't write, Roberto.<br> I'll show you how to write.<br> Look how Roberto<br> can make pictures.<br> That... That's a truck.<br> See?<br> And here's a soldier on a horse.<br> Look! A tank!<br> I will catch me<br> a tank like that!<br> Whatever passes,<br> make a mark.<br> The man on the horse<br> is for cavalry.<br> Each mark will mean a troop<br> of 20 mounted men. Understand?<br> Each troop, a mark.<br> In this way,<br> I can write. Yes.<br> That's an educated pencil!<br> One paper is for movement up the road,<br> the other for movement down the road.<br> When you get back tonight, I'll know<br> what they're moving up to the front.<br> Better get along,<br> and take some food with you.<br> Can I write too? Huh?<br> I want you to watch the bridge<br> and the two sentry posts.<br> See if more soldiers are brought and<br> at what intervals the guard is changed.<br> What... What is "intervals"?<br> How many hours the sentries stay on<br> and at what time changes are made.<br> Yeah.<br> - Without a watch?<br> - Take mine.<br> Oh!<br> What a watch!<br> Look at what a complication.<br> - Such a watch should be able<br> to read and write.<br> - Don't fool with it.<br> - Can you tell time?<br> - Why not?<br> With luck.<br> You don't need to be a clown.<br> Do what I tell you<br> and keep out of sight.<br> Salud, gypsy.<br> Did you see the air machines?<br> See them?<br> We ate them<br> for breakfast.<br> Is there food, Pilar? I'm hungry.<br> It's a long walk<br> from La Granja.<br> La Granja?<br> Yes, Roberto.<br> You wish tobacco?<br> - You?<br> - Didn't you sleep here last night?<br> For a while, yes.<br> Then I thought of my woman<br> and children in La Granja.<br> - Then I went to La Granja.<br> - Wasn't that dangerous?<br> Eh, it's all a matter of<br> getting past their sentries.<br> That's why<br> I only go at night.<br> Oh, Maria.<br> See much movement along<br> the road last night?<br> Nothing.<br> A few trucks, as usual.<br> Cars.<br> A few guns, as usual.<br> - No troops.<br> - Pick up any news in town?<br> But nothing.<br> Oh...<br> It still goes badly in the north.<br> That's not news.<br> Oh, yes, there is talk that<br> the republic is preparing an attack.<br> - That what?<br> - That we are preparing an offensive.<br> - Where?<br> - Perhaps here.<br> Perhaps near Navacerrada.<br> - Have you heard of it?<br> - Where's that talk come from?<br> Where?<br> Surely you know how rumors fly.<br> The officers talk in the cafes,<br> and the waiters listen.<br> The rumors come running.<br> They say this is<br> an offensive of some size,<br> but, uh, it's only a rumor.<br> What else did you hear?<br> Nothing, man.<br> Uh, just...<br> there is some talk...<br> that the republicans will try<br> to blow the bridges, but...<br> Are you joking?<br> This one<br> doesn't joke, Ingles.<br> Bad luck he doesn't.<br> A man like me is never<br> alarmed by rumors, Pilar.<br> - Remember anything more?<br> - No.<br> Oh, they talk as usual of soldiers to be<br> sent to clean us out of these mountains.<br> There is some talk troops are on the<br> way, but they always talk like that.<br> Is not to give<br> any importance to.<br> Only rumors as usual.<br> Mmmm, rumors.<br> Everything as usual.<br> Things are bad<br> in the north, as usual.<br> The troops come<br> to hunt us out, as usual.<br> An offensive here,<br> as usual.<br> Man, you are a monument<br> to "as usual."<br> But the last two, Pilar,<br> are only rumor.<br> My mother!<br> Let's go, Pilar.<br> Who'll look after my things?<br> The man of rumors. Remain here,<br> Fernando, and guard the explosives.<br> Very well, Pilar.<br> Calm yourself.<br> There is nothing to worry about.<br> Only rumors.<br> Wait.<br> Hello, Maria.<br> Hello, Roberto.<br> Ingles.<br> - Hola, Pilar.<br> - Hola.<br> - Hola, Joaquin.<br> - Hola, Maria.<br> Tell El Sordo<br> I am coming with Ingles.<br> A good boy, Ingles.<br> El Sordo saved him<br> when his family was killed,<br> and now they are like<br> father and son.<br> Ingles, tell me.<br> Have you known many women?<br> - They meant nothing.<br> - I think you lie.<br> Well, maybe, a little.<br> And for this one?<br> For Maria, you care much?<br> Let's get on.<br> What is the reason<br> for the bridge, Ingles?<br> Is there gonna be an attack?<br> And the airplanes this morning.<br> Does that mean the enemy's found out?<br> They're preparing a counterattack?<br> - I only know one thing for certain.<br> - What's that?<br> - You have to shout.<br> - I only know one thing for certain.<br> The bridge has got to go<br> when the attack starts.<br> To do that, we've got to have more<br> horses and more men, if we can get them.<br> When do we blow it?<br> Day after...<br> Day after tomorrow.<br> - Why not tonight?<br> - Orders.<br> - How do you get whiskey?<br> - Make it.<br> No, no, no. I joke.<br> This is good whiskey.<br> We got it on a raid.<br> No ice.<br> Plenty ice up there.<br> Too far.<br> Easier blow the bridge<br> tonight.<br> I'd be shot for it.<br> Do it in daylight<br> and we may all be shot for it.<br> - Not if we have horses.<br> - Hmm?<br> Not if we have enough horses.<br> We'll get out of here quickly<br> before the soldiers come after us.<br> I have five horses<br> and four men.<br> Five men, Sordo.<br> So it is.<br> Five with the boy.<br> Five men<br> and five horses.<br> - That's ten horses for 15 people.<br> - Mmm.<br> We've got to have<br> five more horses.<br> For the retreat, yes. No one<br> will get out alive without a horse.<br> - How can you get horses?<br> - Steal 'em.<br> Only soldiers<br> have horses now.<br> Soldiers and thieves like us.<br> - Can you get five more tonight?<br> - When?<br> Tonight.<br> We can try.<br> - Good.<br> - Maybe not so good.<br> Not good if it snows.<br> Horses make tracks,<br> and soldiers follow tracks.<br> - It is too late for snow, Sordo.<br> - Hmm?<br> It's the month of May.<br> And the sun is shining.<br> Look at the young general.<br> Already he's stealing horses.<br> He's always talking, Pilar, how<br> he's carried the girl from the train.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Let's see you carry her...<br> down the hill, my boy.<br> Now you make fun of me.<br> Wait, Joaquin!<br> I'll carry you on my shoulders!<br> Look, Ingles.<br> Look at the bullfighter.<br> He's crying.<br> Don't mock, Pilar.<br> He was telling about his sister.<br> She was a prisoner, as I was. He only<br> heard yesterday that she was dead.<br> I am your sister<br> now, Joaquin.<br> We all love you, and you still have<br> a family. We are your family.<br> Including the Ingles.<br> Is that right, Ingles?<br> - Of course.<br> - You hear that, boy?<br> The Ingles<br> is your brother.<br> Certainly.<br> We're all brothers, Joaquin.<br> Thank you, Ingles.<br> And don't worry.<br> I'll get you a horse tonight.<br> One for Maria too.<br> What about me? Do I have to<br> kiss you too to get a horse?<br> It's been years since<br> I kissed a bullfighter.<br> Hold this, Ingles,<br> 'til I get a good kiss at him.<br> Ha! Look at him. He's afraid of a kiss<br> as he was afraid of a bull.<br> You don't need<br> to make a joke of it.<br> When I kiss, it won't be as a sister.<br> That's dreadful, kissing as a sister.<br> Don't be so brutal, Pilar.<br> I love you very much,<br> but why do you speak so brutally?<br> Why do you think, girl?<br> Huh?<br> Rest, Pilar.<br> You are tired.<br> Shut up. Nobody<br> asked your advice.<br> You think I'm<br> an old woman, huh?<br> Sit down.<br> Many things tire me.<br> And one of them<br> is to be old and ugly.<br> And another is to see panic<br> in the face of a boy...<br> when I say as a joke<br> I might kiss him.<br> It's not true.<br> You didn't see that.<br> What do you know of it,<br> you with your face and your Ingles?<br> I have uneven temper today,<br> and I'm jealous.<br> How foolish.<br> I'm an ugly old woman,<br> and I love you very much, child.<br> I love you too.<br> You're not ugly.<br> Go on, I'm not ugly.<br> I was born ugly.<br> Do you know how<br> an ugly woman feels?<br> Do you know what it is<br> to be ugly all your life...<br> and to feel in here<br> that you are beautiful?<br> You are beautiful.<br> Try to use your head<br> and not your heart and listen.<br> I'm telling you things of much interest.<br> Does it interest you?<br> - Maria's right.<br> - Two of a kind.<br> You are a prize for any woman,<br> if you'd ever let go of yourself.<br> And this one.<br> This one is a gift<br> to any man...<br> if she could cook<br> a little better.<br> Give me a cigarette and listen.<br> Life is very curious.<br> I would have made<br> a good man,<br> but I'm all woman<br> and all ugly.<br> Yet many men have loved me.<br> Is that strange?<br> I don't think<br> you're ugly.<br> Don't lie to me.<br> Or has it begun to work with you too?<br> No, no, no, no.<br> Look. I am ugly.<br> Yet one can have a feeling here<br> that blinds a man while he loves you.<br> He thinks<br> you are beautiful,<br> and one day,<br> for no reason at all,<br> he sees you ugly,<br> as you really are,<br> and he's not blind<br> anymore.<br> Then you see yourself<br> as ugly as he sees you...<br> and you lose<br> your man and your feeling.<br> Then one day the feeling...<br> that idiotic feeling<br> that you are beautiful...<br> grows inside you again.<br> And another man sees you<br> and thinks you are beautiful.<br> And it's all to do over again.<br> Now I am past it.<br> But it still might come again.<br> Lift your head.<br> This silliness is over.<br> I was only jealous<br> of your 19 years.<br> It isn't a jealousy<br> that lasts.<br> You won't be 19 always.<br> You, see, I have<br> evil thoughts, Ingles.<br> If I want, I did.<br> I take you away from this cropped head.<br> Even with my ugly face.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> No, no, no, no.<br> Sit there.<br> I have a surprise for you.<br> Close your eyes.<br> You too, Ingles.<br> No.<br> Tightly, both of you.<br> Pilar!<br> Pilar, wait!<br> Shut up, Ingles!<br> - I'm bored with both of you!<br> - Pilar!<br> Let her go, Roberto.<br> Let her go.<br> - Don't you want to be alone with me?<br> - Of course.<br> And I want to be with you, Roberto.<br> That's what Pilar knows.<br> She knows everything.<br> I'm beginning to believe it.<br> Will she be all right?<br> Oh, you don't have<br> to worry about Pilar.<br> It's a wonderful day,<br> Roberto.<br> What are you<br> worrying about?<br> - About you.<br> - Me?<br> Why?<br> Because I'm so happy?<br> I wish you weren't here,<br> Maria.<br> - What?<br> - I mean it.<br> I'm thinking about what's going<br> to happen to you after the bridge.<br> Can't I go with you?<br> Hmm? El Sordo<br> will get us horses.<br> I know we can't escape without them,<br> but he'll get us horses. I know it.<br> You've got to understand, Maria,<br> I'm in this war to the finish.<br> I can't have anything serious<br> in my life.<br> A man doing what I'm doing<br> never knows what's gonna happen.<br> Whatever happens to you<br> will happen to me.<br> - Haven't you any people in the Republic?<br> - No.<br> No relatives at all?<br> You must have people somewhere.<br> My father<br> and my mother...<br> I saw them killed.<br> My father was the mayor<br> of our town and a Republican.<br> When the Nationalists<br> took the town,<br> they lined up all the Republicans<br> against the wall.<br> My father cried out very loud,<br> "Long live the Republic!"<br> Then they shot him.<br> But my mother was<br> not a Republican.<br> She had no politics,<br> but she loved my father<br> and she couldn't say that.<br> So she just looked at my father who<br> lay there on his face at her feet...<br> and she said, "Long live my husband<br> who was the mayor of this town."<br> She said it very loud,<br> like a shriek,<br> and then they shot and she fell<br> and I wanted to go to her,<br> but we were all tied.<br> We were tied by the wrists<br> in a long line of girls and women.<br> And I wanted to be shot too,<br> and I was going to say,<br> "Long live the Republic<br> and my mother and my father..."<br> But instead there was<br> no more shooting.<br> They... They herded us<br> up the hill...<br> and through the streets,<br> through the square.<br> My...<br> My father's office<br> was in the city hall.<br> But they took us across<br> the street to the...<br> to the barbershop.<br> - Oh, I want to tell you.<br> - No. Don't.<br> Roberto, are you angry<br> about something?<br> Of course not.<br> I'm glad.<br> I won't cry anymore.<br> Oh, Roberto.<br> I like...<br> I don't know how to kiss<br> or I would kiss you.<br> Where do the noses go?<br> Always I wonder<br> where the noses would go.<br> They're not in the way,<br> are they?<br> I always thought<br> they would be in the way.<br> Look, I can do it myself.<br> Maria...<br> Oh, did I do it wrong?<br> Look, Pilar.<br> Roberto fell in the brook.<br> Already she makes you blind,<br> eh, Ingles?<br> Ah.<br> - Hola.<br> - Ah, hola, Ingles.<br> - Hola, Ingles.<br> - Hola, Ingles.<br> Come sit down here,<br> where it's warm.<br> Hey.<br> I'll take your shoes and put them<br> in the smoke of the fire to dry.<br> Say, don't burn 'em. I don't want<br> to stand around here barefooted.<br> Maria,<br> fetch me some dry socks.<br> Your lord and master.<br> Here's the key.<br> The pack is locked.<br> - Who's on guard at the top?<br> - Agustin.<br> Put these on.<br> Dry your feet well.<br> You can't dry them with your hair?<br> What a swine.<br> Hit him with a chunk of wood,<br> Maria.<br> I'm joking<br> because I'm happy.<br> - You are happy?<br> - Yes. I think everything goes well.<br> Oh, keep this under your feet<br> until your shoes are dry.<br> Must you care for him<br> as a child?<br> No, as a man<br> who's cold and wet.<br> He's a man who's just<br> come home to his house.<br> Take the coffee,<br> worthless one.<br> Does it always grow dark<br> this early?<br> No, Ingles,<br> it's the weather.<br> The wind is very disorderly.<br> Seven, please.<br> - Growing colder?<br> - Yes, Ingles.<br> It is not correct to be so cold<br> in the month of May.<br> - Oh.<br> - Hello.<br> - Any movement on the road, Anselmo?<br> - Not much, Roberto.<br> It's all marked<br> on the papers.<br> - Gypsy, what about the bridge?<br> - Huh?<br> Uh, six-hour, uh, int-intervals.<br> I stay 'til they change watch,<br> at noon and 6:00.<br> It was a long watch, Ingles,<br> and cold!<br> My, my bones bre...<br> What about<br> the sawmill post?<br> Ei-Eight men and a corporal.<br> No more arrived.<br> Hmm. What about the post<br> across the bridge?<br> The road-mender's hut?<br> I didn't get<br> that far.<br> I remembered what you said;<br> to be careful.<br> See? Well...<br> - Only ten cars, hmm? Yeah.<br> - All written down, Roberto.<br> Ingles!<br> How do you like it, Pilar?<br> Very beautiful...<br> the snow, eh?<br> Get out of my sight!<br> God help El Sordo.<br> If it snows all night,<br> it may cover his tracks.<br> If! If!<br> How do you like it, woman, eh?<br> How do you like to command<br> when it snows?<br> Shut up, drunkard!<br> Yeah, I know why you went<br> to see El Sordo.<br> Horses make tracks<br> in the snow, Ingles. Yeah.<br> Now there will be<br> no offensive, no bridge.<br> No, just snow.<br> Yeah.<br> And no making love<br> in the heather!<br> Watch your mouth!<br> No, let me.<br> Maria.<br> Maria.<br> Wipe the table clean,<br> Maria.<br> - Wipe your own spillings!<br> - Maria!<br> Wipe first your chin, drunkard,<br> and then the table!<br> Maria.<br> Pay no attention to him.<br> He's drunk.<br> Fix my shoes, Maria.<br> Are you really drunk?<br> Why not?<br> But not too drunk<br> to watch your mouth!<br> - No one on guard at the top?<br> - In this storm? What for?<br> No soldiers will move<br> in these mountains tonight.<br> Pilar, bring me<br> something hot to eat.<br> Wine, Ingles?<br> I thought I was Roberto.<br> I call you "Ingles"<br> before the others.<br> Roberto? Huh.<br> Don Roberto.<br> - How's Don Roberto?<br> - Fine, Don Pablo.<br> How's Bacchus?<br> Who is Bacchus?<br> You ought to know.<br> He's your constant companion.<br> I don't know such a man.<br> - You say funny things, Ingles.<br> - Sure, I do.<br> - I'm a laugh every minute.<br> - Pay no attention. He's drunk.<br> Tell us, Ingles,<br> why have you come so far<br> to fight for our Republic?<br> A man fights for what<br> he believes in, Fernando.<br> Yeah, but...<br> in his own country.<br> Well, maybe you feel that I'm sticking<br> my nose into other people's business,<br> but I don't feel that way.<br> It's not only Spain<br> fighting here, is it?<br> It's Germany and Italy on one side<br> and Russia on the other,<br> and the Spanish people are<br> right in the middle of it all.<br> The Nazis and Fascists<br> are just as much against democracy...<br> as they are against the Communists.<br> They're using your country as a proving<br> ground for their new war machinery...<br> their tanks and dive-bombers<br> and stuff like that...<br> so they can get the jump<br> on the democracies...<br> and knock off England<br> and France and my country...<br> before we get armed<br> and ready to fight.<br> Were you always<br> a Republican?<br> And your father?<br> Sure, he voted the Republican<br> ticket all his life.<br> Did they<br> shoot him for it?<br> No. No, they don't shoot you<br> for being a Republican in America.<br> Roberto was a professor.<br> He told me this afternoon.<br> Not a professor, Maria,<br> an instructor.<br> That's the same thing. He was<br> a teacher in a college in America.<br> The professor has no beard.<br> He's a false professor.<br> Shut up!<br> What did you teach, Ingles?<br> Spanish. That's how<br> I got to know Spain.<br> No. No beard.<br> He has no beard.<br> He's a false professor.<br> Ah, stop it!<br> Wouldn't it be easier<br> to teach English?<br> Why shouldn't he teach Spanish?<br> Doesn't he speak it?<br> Yes, but, in a way, it is undignified<br> for a foreigner to teach Spanish.<br> I mean nothing<br> against you, Ingles.<br> - No beard.<br> - He doesn't teaches it to Spaniards!<br> - I should hope not, Pilar!<br> - Let me finish, you mule!<br> He teaches Spanish<br> to Americans!<br> Can't they speak Spanish?<br> Mule! North Americans<br> speak English!<br> - No beard. Nope. No beard.<br> - Enough!<br> But he's got no beard.<br> Beard. No beard.<br> He does have a beard.<br> You should know, girl.<br> - Pay no attention, Ingles. He's drunk.<br> - I don't think he's so drunk.<br> Yes. Yes, I am drunk.<br> I doubt it. Cowardly, yes!<br> You try to provoke me, Ingles.<br> Nah, you won't get rid<br> of me that way.<br> I said cowardly, not drunk.<br> See?<br> See, I don't provoke.<br> A signal to the woman<br> that you've failed.<br> Pilar has nothing<br> to do with it.<br> You spoke to the girl<br> as a coward.<br> I don't provoke.<br> See, woman?<br> I teach the professor<br> I don't provoke.<br> I'll still be alive<br> when you're all dead!<br> I'm not stupid.<br> I don't provoke.<br> I-I don't provoke.<br> To the professor,<br> to the senora commander,<br> and to all...<br> all the illusioned ones.<br> That's silly.<br> It's a waste of good wine.<br> I don't provoke.<br> I am drunk.<br> The wise man gets drunk<br> to spend his time with fools.<br> - Get out!<br> - Yeah, I go.<br> I'll go to the horses.<br> They have<br> more sense than men.<br> Tell them<br> about the bridge, Professor,<br> and how to escape afterwards.<br> Who will lead your patriots<br> in their retreat, eh?<br> Get out!<br> It's still falling,<br> Ingles.<br> Let me go!<br> I'll kill 'im!<br> Give me that rifle!<br> - Why didn't you kill him last night?<br> - What do you think he'll do now?<br> He will toss a bomb in here.<br> It's his style.<br> Give me your pistol.<br> I'll shoot him when he comes back!<br> Do you want to blow us all up?<br> Remember what's in those sacks.<br> - What fools we are!<br> - Why didn't you kill him last night?<br> He's got to die now!<br> Pilar?<br> What do you say,<br> Pilar?<br> Yes.<br> Whatever you will.<br> I'm for it now.<br> Then let all speak.<br> Andres, what do you say?<br> - Yes! Kill him!<br> - Kill him.<br> - Primitivo?<br> - Kill him!<br> - Agustin?<br> - Do you need to ask? Kill him!<br> - Fernando?<br> - Don't forget, Ingles, that he's smart.<br> - He knows the way to the Gredos.<br> - Fool!<br> - Who will lead our retreat<br> after the bridge?<br> - El Sordo!<br> He knows the way<br> as well as that traitor!<br> Pilar, tell them that<br> El Sordo will lead us.<br> - Couldn't we hold him as a prisoner?<br> - Who'd look after him!<br> He is right, Fernando.<br> It would take us all to watch him!<br> - Why not sell him to the enemy?<br> - Shut up, Gypsy!<br> - That's filthy!<br> - No worse than Pablo.<br> If you'd blind him,<br> he will be easy to handle.<br> Watch your tongue, Gypsy.<br> Didn't Pablo blind the civil<br> guard who was wounded?<br> Speak of blinding again,<br> and you go with Pablo.<br> Pilar, I haven't been<br> allowed to finish yet.<br> Finish then. Finish!<br> I still maintain<br> we need Pablo.<br> We should reason with him<br> and point out...<br> - that his conduct...<br> - Stop it, man!<br> Even here one man can make<br> a bureaucracy with his mouth.<br> You voted to kill him.<br> Now have done with it!<br> Kill him when he returns.<br> - I must wait for him<br> to make the first move.<br> - Why wait? Kill him, man!<br> - In cold blood?<br> - Cold. You Ingleses are all cold.<br> Give me your gun!<br> I'm not cold! I'm burning!<br> Not in here.<br> No shooting in here.<br> You'll see how cold my blood is<br> when that coward comes back!<br> Ugly.<br> All of it's ugly.<br> Remember one thing,<br> Ingles.<br> He wasn't always like this.<br> When the war broke out,<br> he wasn't the man you see now.<br> Brutal, yes,<br> but a leader without fear.<br> Had it not been for Pablo,<br> the Nationalists would have taken<br> our town the day the revolution began,<br> for many Nationalists<br> lived there.<br> But Pablo organized the people,<br> and in the night,<br> all the suspected citizens...<br> were dragged from their beds<br> and locked up in the city hall.<br> Then, in the dark,<br> he surrounded the police barracks,<br> cut the telephone wires,<br> and placed dynamite under the wall.<br> When morning came, he called on<br> the civil guards to surrender,<br> but they wouldn't,<br> so he blew the wall open!<br> But then there was<br> a shout for us to stop firing,<br> and four civil guards walked out<br> with their hands up.<br> Pablo said, "Show us how to die,<br> you who have always done the killing!"<br> "What are you going to do?" the officer<br> asked. "Shoot you!" said Pablo.<br> Pablo passed behind them.<br> I can hear the pistol even now...<br> and see the barrel jerk,<br> and the head of each man drop forward.<br> One held his head still<br> when the pistol touched it.<br> One shivered in his whole body<br> and his head was shaking.<br> Only one put his hands in front<br> of his eyes, and he was the last one.<br> The hat fell from his head and Pablo<br> said, "Look, Pilar, he is polite.<br> He takes off his hat<br> for a woman like you."<br> By this time, a crowd was gathering<br> in the plaza in front of the city hall.<br> "Why is it done this way?"<br> They asked Pablo.<br> "To save bullets," he said, "and to<br> make all of you share in the killing."<br> I had picked up the hat<br> of a civil guard, and a man said,<br> "Pilar, it's bad taste<br> to wear that hat,<br> for now we've finished with<br> such things as the civil guards."<br> A drunkard yelled,<br> as if at a bullfight,<br> "Let the bull out!<br> Pablo, let the bull out!"<br> And then everyone shouted,<br> "Here comes the first one!"<br> It was Don Benito Garcia,<br> the mayor.<br> And he walked between the lines<br> and nothing happened.<br> He passed two men,<br> four men, eight men...<br> and nothing happened.<br> From the roof, someone shouted,<br> "What's the matter, cowards?"<br> But nothing happened.<br> I was watching one man who had<br> a dispute with the mayor...<br> about a piece of land,<br> and who hated him.<br> And it was this man<br> who first raised his flail.<br> Don Faustino Rivero was known<br> as an annoyer of girls.<br> He wanted to be known<br> as a bullfighter...<br> and went much with gypsies<br> and the bullfighters,<br> but he was a coward<br> and was considered a joke.<br> But Don Faustino was inspired by the<br> example of Don Garcia and stood there...<br> Iooking handsome and brave,<br> and he made his face scornful.<br> Now the lines began to shout,<br> "Listen, Don Faustino, there are<br> beautiful girls over the cliff.<br> Why don't you chase them?"<br> It was then I knew that<br> the lines had become savage,<br> and it was, first,<br> the insult of Don Garcia,<br> and, second, the cowardice<br> of Don Faustino that had made them so.<br> Don Guillermo was not a bad man.<br> He was only in politics<br> because of his wife.<br> I heard her screaming,<br> "Guillermo!<br> Husband!<br> Wait and I'll go with you!"<br> He couldn't see her without his glasses,<br> but he looked up and waved his hand,<br> and no one in the lines<br> would hit him.<br> Then a drunkard yelled,<br> "Guillermo!"<br> "What passes, Pilar?"<br> They asked me.<br> "I am sick," I told them.<br> And they said, "Us too.<br> We'll take no further part in it."<br> But the worst was yet to come when Pablo<br> opened the door of the city hall...<br> and let the mob in to kill<br> the rest of the prisoners.<br> For, yes,<br> it was now a mob...<br> and no longer had any organization.<br> The snow has stopped,<br> Ingles.<br> Now we'll have good weather<br> for the bridge.<br> Yes, I've come back<br> to help you.<br> I cannot desert Pilar<br> and my people.<br> Wait, man!<br> - What trick is this, drunkard?<br> - No trick, Pilar.<br> I've changed my mind,<br> that's all.<br> You are right about the bridge,<br> and I'm with you now.<br> Don't forget you'll need me<br> for the retreat, Ingles.<br> Just what I said.<br> You were listening!<br> You're afraid of being killed,<br> that's why you've changed!<br> You were listening!<br> Do you think I like to hear it<br> told how we killed those men?<br> If I could bring them<br> back to life, I'd... I'd do it.<br> - Liar!<br> - No, I mean it.<br> I wish I could<br> bring them back to life.<br> - Even Don Ricardo, who cursed me.<br> - Stop it!<br> Yes, I would restore<br> them all to life.<br> That's God's truth!<br> It's also true that l...<br> I'm with you now.<br> I was drunk.<br> Now I'm not drunk,<br> and I've changed my mind.<br> Now you trust me or not,<br> but there's no one who...<br> can get you out of here<br> to the Gredos as... as I can.<br> I believe you.<br> But take an oath.<br> Are you with us now<br> and in favor of the bridge?<br> Yes, yes, man.<br> And you think it can be successful<br> in spite of the snow?<br> There will be no snow<br> at the bridge.<br> You have confidence?<br> Why not?<br> Fools!<br> Lunatics!<br> You're all crazy<br> if you believe him!<br> - What, Roberto?<br> - Trooper.<br> - What does it mean?<br> - I don't know.<br> - See anything?<br> - No.<br> - Are you sure it was a trooper?<br> - Yes.<br> - Where's Pablo?<br> - In the cave.<br> Man, what a horse!<br> Never mind the horse.<br> Get in the saddle.<br> This horse made tracks in here.<br> He must make them out again.<br> You have much sense,<br> Ingles.<br> I'll hide him in the hills<br> 'til the snow has melted.<br> Keep your eyes open.<br> There's bound to be more cavalry.<br> Go back to the cave and get<br> the machine gun and my binoculars.<br> We've got to cover<br> the pass below.<br> You give him a hand.<br> You too, Anselmo.<br> Go back to that soldier and see<br> if you can find more clips for this gun.<br> And leave<br> his pockets alone!<br> Roberto!<br> Roberto,<br> I am coming with you!<br> Go back to the cave. Tell Pilar to<br> get packed. We may have to run for it.<br> - No.<br> - Go back, Maria. There may be a fight.<br> - I'll hold the legs<br> of the machine gun for you.<br> - No.<br> - Let me hold the machine gun<br> while you fire it.<br> - Go back.<br> Please let me go with you.<br> I want to help.<br> Then go back.<br> Kiss me.<br> - You're shameless.<br> - Yes.<br> - What's happened to that gypsy?<br> - I saw him coming, Roberto.<br> Then he saw a rabbit<br> and went after it.<br> Fine time to go hunting.<br> Primitivo, get up on that rock<br> as high as you can climb.<br> If you see soldiers,<br> throw a stone down for a signal.<br> Wait a minute. If you see one soldier,<br> raise your rifle like this.<br> - Like this.<br> - Yeah.<br> If more than one,<br> pump it like this.<br> - One for each soldier. Understand?<br> - Yes.<br> Anselmo, go down with Agustin and hold<br> the legs of the gun if I have to shoot.<br> - Here, hold this for me.<br> - For what?<br> I'm liable<br> to shoot me a gypsy.<br> Roberto, now we will<br> have fresh meat! See?<br> Does something<br> annoy you, Roberto?<br> - If you weren't a gypsy, I'd shoot you.<br> - But why?<br> Look how fat they are.<br> Look. L...<br> Get down.<br> - Rifles.<br> - Now the soldiers are hunting.<br> Wait here.<br> - Is it Pablo?<br> - El Sordo.<br> - Come, Ingles, now they need us.<br> - Where?<br> To join with El Sordo.<br> To die there?<br> Don't you realize they're lost?<br> If we show ourselves,<br> we're done for too.<br> Then what happens to the bridge?<br> Bridge?<br> That's our friend!<br> - Listen, Agustin...<br> - I listen to that!<br> Are you afraid to fight<br> for our friends?<br> Roberto!<br> Roberto!<br> Oh, Roberto!<br> Oh! We could hear<br> the firing at the cave!<br> I was afraid!<br> I was afraid!<br> - You shouldn't have come here.<br> - I let her come, Ingles.<br> She was half crazy.<br> She thought you were fighting.<br> - Why aren't we fighting?<br> - They want to go to El Sordo.<br> Have you lost your minds?<br> What kind of locos<br> do we have in our camp?<br> - Men, not women!<br> - Then act like men!<br> Don't you think<br> you'll die soon enough?<br> Swallow your tongue, woman,<br> and choke yourself!<br> Silence!<br> What use is courage<br> if you have no head?<br> El Sordo has both.<br> He'll understand.<br> Was he coming with the horses<br> when they found him?<br> He'd have found better<br> cover on this side.<br> Looks like he did his best<br> to lead them away from us.<br> Did you hit him?<br> The potful of grease<br> ducked back!<br> I can tell you who is<br> a potful of grease!<br> That Pilar!<br> - She knows we are dying here.<br> - What could Pilar do?<br> - Take these fat guts from the rear!<br> - There isn't any rear.<br> They're all around the hill.<br> A hundred, two hundred, maybe more now.<br> Bandidos! Cobardes!<br> Can you hear me, you sons<br> of four-legged devils?<br> Surrender now, you bandits,<br> before our planes blow you to bits!<br> Will they send planes?<br> With bombs or machine guns?<br> Both, my son.<br> I'm giving you a chance<br> to surrender before the planes come!<br> Do you hear what<br> I am saying, bandidos?<br> Let's insult him.<br> Maybe he'll show his head.<br> Are you ready to surrender?<br> - Who has a big pistol?<br> - Here.<br> The planes are coming!<br> Are you going to surrender?<br> Listen.<br> He can't wait for the planes.<br> He wants to be a hero,<br> lead us back with a rope<br> around our necks.<br> Have you seen any movement<br> since the shots?<br> - No, sir.<br> - What do you think?<br> I don't believe it.<br> Why shouldn't they do it?<br> They knew they had to die.<br> It's better than being<br> bombed or captured, isn't it?<br> I think it's a trick.<br> What about the planes?<br> They should have come<br> a long time ago.<br> - How many shots did you count?<br> - Five.<br> It's ridiculous<br> if they are dead.<br> I don't want to make myself ridiculous<br> hiding down here from dead men!<br> I think we should wait<br> for the planes, sir.<br> Fire, cowards,<br> if you are alive!<br> Fire on a man who has<br> no fear of you!<br> Shoot, you<br> suffering bandits!<br> Now... do you believe me?<br> No one's alive up there.<br> You!<br> Go up and see.<br> - Don't you hear me?<br> - Yes, my Captain.<br> Then get up and go.<br> - Do you hear me?<br> - Yes, my Captain.<br> Why don't you go then?<br> - I don't want to, my Captain.<br> - You don't want to?<br> - You don't want to!<br> - I'm afraid, my Captain.<br> - Captain Mora.<br> - Lieutenant Berrendo?<br> It is possible<br> the soldier is right.<br> Right to say he's afraid?<br> - Right to say he doesn't<br> want to obey an order?<br> - No, sir.<br> - Right that that's a trick.<br> - Don't you hear me say they're all dead?<br> You mean Julian,<br> our comrades on the slope?<br> - I agree, sir.<br> - Very well.<br> The sniper stays here.<br> I'll take care of him later.<br> You and I will go<br> to the top.<br> - Not me.<br> - What?<br> I will go if you order me,<br> but under protest.<br> No, I'll go alone.<br> The smell of cowardice<br> is too strong here.<br> Assassins!<br> Cowards!<br> Shoot me!<br> Kill me!<br> Can you<br> hear me coming?<br> No! You can't<br> hear me coming!<br> You think I am a coward<br> like others? Shoot me!<br> - Kill me!<br> - "Shoot me. Kill me."<br> - Cowards! Vermin!<br> - Look at him coming.<br> - Scum of the earth!<br> Shoot me if you are alive!<br> - What an animal.<br> - Look at him stride.<br> - Bandidos!<br> - Oh, this one is for me!<br> - Do you hear me?<br> - This one we take with us.<br> - No, you do not hear me!<br> - Come on, loudmouth. Keep on walking.<br> - Cowards!<br> - Look at his stars. He's a Captain.<br> - Have you stopped breathing yet?<br> Stick out your chest,<br> little Captain.<br> - I will give you another bullet!<br> - Don't stop. Don't be late.<br> It's a long trip, Captain.<br> A long voyage.<br> Fire, cowards,<br> if you are alive!<br> - Scum of the earth!<br> - Now, comrade voyager.<br> Close enough, comrade voyager.<br> Can you hear me coming?<br> No, you can't hear me coming!<br> - I am going to spit in that face...<br> - Now. Now!<br> Kill me!<br> Shoot me!<br> Joaquin!<br> Quick!<br> Aim it higher!<br> Pilar?<br> Pilar!<br> - Hola, Pilar!<br> - Hola.<br> - Salud, Robert.<br> - Salud.<br> Salud, Pilar.<br> Look at him.<br> Already at the wine.<br> - Did you come back for us or the wine?<br> - Both.<br> He came back<br> for his horses.<br> Much riding, Ingles.<br> I couldn't turn back<br> 'til the snow has melted.<br> Didn't you run into<br> the cavalry?<br> But a good horse,<br> the new one.<br> I took to high ground<br> and came back through the hills.<br> Why is there no food, Pilar?<br> Where have you been?<br> Guarding the pass below.<br> The Ingles wouldn't leave...<br> until he was sure<br> there was no more cavalry.<br> Ingles...<br> Ingles, l...<br> I was with El Sordo.<br> You mean you were<br> in the fight?<br> No.<br> On my way back here.<br> It was dark and I went...<br> I went up the hill.<br> Five dead at the top.<br> They'd taken their heads.<br> Joaquin too?<br> - No heads.<br> - Now let the fighting come!<br> - No heads.<br> - Ingles!<br> Anselmo says there is much movement<br> across the bridge!<br> - I was just leaving<br> the lookout when it started.<br> - What started?<br> Oh, guns, trucks,<br> armored cars, even tanks.<br> - Tanks!<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> Everything moving up<br> toward the front.<br> I marked it all down<br> on the paper.<br> I waited 'til the second column<br> had crossed the bridge.<br> Anything more coming?<br> Yes. I could hear another column<br> as I came up through the pass.<br> You want me to go back<br> and watch?<br> Not now.<br> Were these trucks full of soldiers?<br> Oh, yes, Roberto.<br> What does it mean?<br> It means they know the Republic<br> is going to attack when the sun rises.<br> Yes, now they know.<br> They move up<br> to meet our offensive.<br> Who knows the way through the lines<br> to the side of the Republic?<br> - I do.<br> - I need you at the bridge.<br> - Who else?<br> - I know it.<br> - Have you been through before?<br> - Yes, twice.<br> Eight hours.<br> Nearly nine hours.<br> - Can you make it to Navacerrada?<br> - I can try.<br> - I don't mean try. Can you do it?<br> - I could do it in less time...<br> - with luck and carrying no pack.<br> - I need you here.<br> We came by a longer route because<br> we carried explosive. It was safer.<br> I will get there<br> as well as another.<br> And if anything happens,<br> it could happen to anyone.<br> This dispatch is for General Golz.<br> Remember the name.<br> - Golz.<br> - Where will I find him?<br> Ask when you get to our lines.<br> They'll tell you.<br> This seal ought to get you<br> through our lines.<br> If you have any trouble,<br> just show them what I've written.<br> Now try to make it in six hours,<br> seven at the most.<br> Remember, the attack<br> is set for sunrise.<br> I would rather be with you<br> at the bridge.<br> Get this information to General Golz,<br> and we won't have to blow any bridge.<br> He'll call off the bombardment,<br> and we'll all escape to safety.<br> Only one thing is certain. The bridge<br> has got to go if the attack starts.<br> Pablo! Pablo! Come back!<br> Pilar! Pilar!<br> Pablo has gone!<br> Didn't I tell you<br> he was a coward?<br> You and your confidence!<br> If it wasn't for you,<br> I would have killed him!<br> - I told you what he was!<br> - I tell you, I have been betrayed!<br> Betrayed!<br> Listen to him!<br> He has been betrayed!<br> You fool!<br> No slanders, please!<br> Forget it.<br> I'm the one to blame.<br> Andres,<br> you better get going.<br> And good luck.<br> Should l... Should I go back<br> and guard the horses?<br> - Fool!<br> - No.<br> - I'll look after them.<br> - Who will lead the retreat now?<br> Shut up, Gypsy.<br> Andres will get to the general.<br> Get back in the cave.<br> Pilar, get everything ready for<br> the bridge one hour before daylight...<br> and get what sleep you can.<br> I'll look after the horses.<br> Look after my things.<br> Salud!<br> - Don't shoot, comrades! Don't shoot!<br> - Who are you?<br> A comrade, Andres Lopez,<br> with a dispatch for General Golz!<br> Why didn't you call the password<br> if you're a comrade?<br> I don't know any password!<br> - Spy! Toss a bomb at him!<br> - No!<br> - That would be a great mistake!<br> - He's not alone, Pedro! Toss a bomb!<br> No! Please! I'm alone!<br> I'm completely by myself!<br> - Allow me to show you my papers.<br> - Are you sure you're alone?<br> How many times must I tell you?<br> I am alone!<br> Stand up!<br> Put your hands<br> above your head!<br> Come on!<br> Listen, I am in a great hurry.<br> I have a dispatch...<br> for General Golz<br> at Navacerrada.<br> - Where is it?<br> - Inside my shirt.<br> How can I show you<br> with my hands up?<br> You're a long way<br> from Navacerrada.<br> Come on. I will take you<br> to Captain Gomez.<br> Spy!<br> I brought your robe.<br> I'll fix it for you.<br> Was this your idea<br> or Pilar's?<br> It was my idea,<br> but Pilar told me to come.<br> Even if she'd told me not to come,<br> I would have come.<br> Will there be<br> fighting tomorrow?<br> Are you afraid?<br> I am afraid for you so much,<br> I do not think of me.<br> Pilar told me I am to go<br> with you after the bridge,<br> that you'll take me<br> to the Republic.<br> You and Pilar<br> will each have a horse.<br> You'll be safe with Pilar.<br> That will leave three<br> horses for the others.<br> But I go with you,<br> not Pilar.<br> I came on foot with the old man<br> and I shall go the same way.<br> No! No, Pilar says no one will<br> get out alive without a horse.<br> If Andres gets through to your general,<br> there will be no bridge, will there?<br> Will there, Roberto?<br> No.<br> Maybe I should have<br> sent word sooner...<br> about the movements here<br> to meet the attack.<br> How much time have we left?<br> A lifetime, Maria.<br> I mean until daylight.<br> Five, six hours.<br> Pilar told me that time<br> is not important.<br> Maybe Pilar is right.<br> Three days and three nights,<br> yet they're everything;<br> longer than the months in prison,<br> longer than the years I've lived.<br> She told me something else<br> when I left the cave.<br> She said we must live all our life<br> in the time that remains.<br> - She said...<br> - What?<br> What did she tell you?<br> She said we would<br> all die tomorrow;<br> that you know it as well as she does,<br> but you give it no importance.<br> She's crazy! That's just more<br> of her gypsy superstition.<br> - You don't believe it?<br> - Of course not.<br> She had a reason<br> for telling me.<br> She said I must tell you<br> everything that happened to me...<br> when they shot<br> my mother and my father.<br> - You've told me.<br> - No. No...<br> I didn't tell you what happened<br> when they herded us up the hill...<br> - and across the square<br> to the barbershop.<br> - I don't want to hear it.<br> Then two men looked at me and one said,<br> "Oh, that's the daughter of the mayor,"<br> and the other said,<br> "Commence with her."<br> They cut the rope and they<br> took me to the barbershop...<br> and they put me<br> in the chair and held me.<br> I looked at my face<br> in the mirror,<br> but all I could see was my mother and<br> my father at the moment of the shooting.<br> And my mother's words were in my head<br> like a scream that went on and on.<br> And... then<br> I could feel a pain,<br> and they were pulling at my hair<br> and cutting it off with a razor and...<br> and then they... they put<br> the braids in my mouth...<br> and tied them around<br> my neck to make a gag.<br> Then they ran clippers<br> across my head.<br> It was... It was then<br> I commenced to cry,<br> because until then I'd been<br> too frozen to feel anything.<br> And in the mirror<br> I could see the men laugh,<br> and I couldn't look away from the horror<br> my face made with the braids tied...<br> in my mouth.<br> Oh!<br> When they took me out the door,<br> I stumbled over the dead barber.<br> They had shot him because<br> he belonged to a union.<br> Then I saw my best friend,<br> Concepcion Garcia,<br> being dragged in by two more men.<br> When she saw me, she screamed.<br> I could hear her screaming...<br> all the time they were<br> shoving me across the square...<br> and into the doorway and up<br> the stairs of the city hall...<br> - to the office of my father...<br> where they put me on the couch.<br> - Maria.<br> It was there the worst<br> things were done.<br> Don't talk about it.<br> Don't think about it anymore.<br> Oh, I was going to tell you<br> on the way back from El Sordo,<br> but I was glad when<br> you wouldn't let me.<br> Then I was happy.<br> I felt as if it had<br> never happened.<br> No. Oh!<br> Pilar said I must<br> tell you everything.<br> Now you won't love me.<br> Tomorrow you'll take me<br> through the lines...<br> and I'll never<br> see you again, never.<br> You won't want me.<br> No, Roberto,<br> we can't change things.<br> But it's true, I never<br> kissed any man until you.<br> - When things were done to me<br> I fought until they tied me!<br> - No one's touched you.<br> - No one.<br> - You believe that?<br> I know that.<br> And you can love me?<br> I can love you more.<br> I could see your headlight<br> for a mile coming down the road!<br> - You want to bring on a shelling?<br> - Where is the Lieutenant Colonel?<br> He's asleep.<br> Who is the bandit?<br> No bandit. He bears a dispatch for<br> General Golz who commands the attack.<br> You're crazy, Gomez. I know of<br> no General Golz nor of no attack.<br> Take this sportsman<br> and get back to your battalion.<br> - Call the Lieutenant Colonel.<br> - Go away.<br> Call him.<br> All you barbers<br> are emotional.<br> Orderly.<br> Call the Lieutenant Colonel.<br> Don't forget,<br> I'm your superior officer.<br> I'm not afraid<br> of your threats.<br> It's cynics like you<br> who will be eliminated.<br> "Purged" is the word you want.<br> Any word will do so long<br> as men like you are liquidated!<br> "Liquidated."<br> Another word foreign to Spain.<br> Shot then! That's Spanish!<br> Can you understand it?<br> Yes, man.<br> But don't talk so loud.<br> Your emotions bore me.<br> - Hello, Gomez.<br> - Colonel.<br> What brings you?<br> Ah!<br> - Why didn't this get here sooner?<br> - Stupidity, my Colonel.<br> I'm not at all sure you can get through<br> now with all the movements on the road.<br> Write them a very strong<br> safe-conduct.<br> You'll need something<br> strong tonight.<br> We're careful<br> before an offensive.<br> You know what<br> I've been thinking about?<br> What I should do<br> to take care of you well.<br> I'll learn from Pilar, and then<br> I'll discover things for myself;<br> - and other things you can tell me.<br> - What about me taking care of myself?<br> No, but you don't.<br> This morning your robe should have been<br> shaken and aired and hung in the sun.<br> And before the dew comes,<br> it should have been taken into shelter.<br> Go on.<br> Your socks should be<br> washed and dried,<br> - and I would see that you had two pair.<br> - What else?<br> This. I would learn<br> how to fire it.<br> That's easy.<br> I'll teach you.<br> Then if you are wounded,<br> we won't be captured.<br> I could kill you<br> before I kill myself.<br> Do you have<br> many ideas like that?<br> No. No, not many.<br> But it's a good one<br> in this war.<br> Pilar gave me this one<br> and showed me how to use it.<br> - I always keep it with me.<br> - Razor blade?<br> She says there's no pain. It's nothing<br> if you press quickly and firmly.<br> And that they can't<br> stop it if it's done.<br> Not if you cut the artery.<br> How long have you been<br> carrying this around?<br> Ever since I was rescued.<br> But I'd rather<br> have you shoot me.<br> Promise me if there's ever any need<br> that you will shoot me.<br> Sure.<br> I promise.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I know it's not easy to do.<br> But there are other things<br> I can do for you.<br> - Besides shoot me?<br> - Yes.<br> I can roll cigarettes for you<br> when you have no more in the box.<br> - Without spilling tobacco?<br> - Yes.<br> And if you are wounded,<br> I'll take care of you...<br> and dress your wound,<br> and I'll wash you and feed you.<br> Maybe I won't be wounded.<br> Then if you're sick,<br> I'll take care of you.<br> I'll make soup for you<br> and read to you.<br> - Maybe I won't get sick.<br> - I'll bring you coffee when you wake up.<br> - Maybe I don't like coffee.<br> - But you do!<br> This morning you had two cups!<br> Suppose I get tired of coffee...<br> and I'm not wounded or sick<br> and I give up smoking...<br> and I have only one pair of socks and<br> roll up my robe myself? What then?<br> Then I'll borrow the scissors<br> of Pilar and cut your hair.<br> - But I don't like having my hair cut.<br> - Neither do I.<br> I like your hair<br> the way it is.<br> So if there's<br> nothing to do for you,<br> I'll sit by you<br> and watch you,<br> and in the nights<br> we'll make love.<br> You are shameless.<br> If you don't love me,<br> I love you enough for both.<br> I was asleep.<br> Oh, I'm sorry I woke up.<br> I didn't know<br> I was sleeping.<br> It was so beautiful<br> to be there in your house.<br> - My house?<br> - Yes. Yes, in America.<br> The one you told me about,<br> where you were a little boy.<br> Does the stairway turn<br> at the top like this?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - And there's the door<br> to your mother's room?<br> Yes, that's the way it was.<br> And you mother was there,<br> and your grandfather too...<br> your grandfather who fought<br> in the American civil war.<br> - He's dead.<br> - He was there just as you described him,<br> and I liked him very much.<br> And I loved your mother.<br> She came out of her room holding a child<br> who looked exactly like my Roberto,<br> and when I asked her<br> whose son it was, she said,<br> "Why, it's yours, Maria."<br> That's why<br> I have to look at you.<br> Maybe you weren't<br> dreaming.<br> No, I was there, just<br> as real as I'm here now.<br> Can't you wait<br> 'til I take you there?<br> Oh, Roberto, that, too, is like<br> a dream, like a wonderful dream.<br> Oh, my hair amuses you because it's odd,<br> but every day it's growing.<br> It will be long,<br> and I will not look ugly,<br> and perhaps you will<br> love me very much.<br> All the things<br> you've told me tonight...<br> it's as if you've already taken me<br> to Madrid and to America.<br> That's just the beginning of our<br> travels. Wait 'til this war is over.<br> Do I please you?<br> Will you always take me with you?<br> Unless you run away<br> from me.<br> No, I'll never<br> go away from you.<br> I loved you<br> when I first saw you.<br> I've always loved you,<br> but I never saw you before.<br> Now I'm your woman.<br> I'll always be your woman.<br> Always!<br> Can you tell me where is<br> the headquarters of General Golz,<br> - commanding the 35th Division?<br> - Not here.<br> I was told he was in this vicinity.<br> What is here?<br> - The comandancia.<br> - Comandancia of what?<br> Who are you to ask<br> so many questions?<br> I am Captain Gomez<br> of the 65th Brigade,<br> and I asked where is<br> the headquarters of General Golz!<br> Listen, I can hear<br> the wind in the trees.<br> Now it will soon be light.<br> It's so beautiful here.<br> Will we ever come back?<br> Some day, Maria.<br> And stay here again?<br> Some day.<br> Do you think<br> Andres got through?<br> We can't tell<br> until sunrise.<br> Are you afraid?<br> Not now.<br> I love you, Roberto.<br> Always remember.<br> I love you as I loved<br> my father and mother,<br> as I love<br> our unborn children,<br> as I love what I love<br> most in the world.<br> And I love you more.<br> Always remember.<br> I'll remember.<br> Nothing can ever<br> part us now, can it?<br> Nothing, Maria.<br> Ingles!<br> Ingles!<br> What is it, Pilar?<br> What's wrong?<br> - It must have been Pablo!<br> - Pablo is gone.<br> What do you mean?<br> Your exploder, the box<br> that explodes the dynamite!<br> When I stirred up the fire to make<br> coffee for the men, I found it.<br> - What?<br> - It was under the ashes.<br> - I thought you were guarding my things.<br> - I slept with them!<br> - You slept well.<br> - He must have done it last night...<br> before we got back<br> from the pass.<br> Maybe it will work again.<br> Is there no other way<br> to explode the charges?<br> Yes. Sure.<br> It's a bad way, but I can do it.<br> - That swine!<br> - What is the way, Ingles?<br> Get me<br> your hand grenades.<br> Do these grenades<br> always explode?<br> Yes, but not strong enough<br> to blow a bridge.<br> - I didn't ask that.<br> Have they always exploded?<br> - Always.<br> I've brought three more men<br> from the band of Elias.<br> Traitor!<br> I've come back, Pilar, and I've<br> brought more men for the bridge.<br> Did you do that?<br> I had a moment of weakness.<br> Kill him, Ingles!<br> Yes, I meant to leave.<br> Having seen what<br> happened to El Sordo,<br> I was afraid to die.<br> But having done<br> such a thing,<br> I was lonely.<br> Do you understand...<br> Ioneliness?<br> I understand cowardice!<br> Don't mock me, woman.<br> Don't you see I've come back?<br> L... I've thought of a way<br> to explode the dynamite.<br> So have I.<br> The only reason I don't shoot you<br> is because we need you.<br> I brought more men<br> for the bridge, Ingles.<br> They don't know<br> you command here, Pilar.<br> They think I'm still the leader here,<br> or they wouldn't have followed me.<br> You are if you wish,<br> for the fighting, yes.<br> I suppose when a man<br> has something once,<br> always something remains.<br> - Our men are waiting below.<br> Tell them we're coming.<br> - Uh-huh.<br> And don't worry<br> about the retreat, Ingles.<br> - Now we have three more horses.<br> - And three more men.<br> Maybe they won't<br> need their horses.<br> You have much control, Ingles.<br> I'm glad he's back.<br> No matter what he is, we need him.<br> One last thing<br> I must tell you.<br> - In that thing of the hand...<br> - What thing of the hand?<br> No, listen.<br> Don't be angry.<br> When I looked in your hand,<br> it was just gypsy humbug.<br> Gypsies do such tricks<br> to make themselves important.<br> Sure, sure. Forget it.<br> - I don't want you to worry.<br> - Who's worrying?<br> The truth is, I saw<br> nothing but happiness;<br> happiness for you<br> and the cropped head.<br> I know that.<br> And I don't need a nurse.<br> I care for you very much,<br> Ingles.<br> Remember that<br> and don't worry.<br> Everything will go well<br> at the bridge.<br> Sure. Everything's all right.<br> Let's go. Get your things together.<br> - Are the orders clear now?<br> - Yes.<br> Take the road mender's hut.<br> Destroy the post.<br> Stop anything from getting through<br> to the bridge as long as possible.<br> - Right, but not a move unless<br> you hear the falling of bombs.<br> - Yeah. Clear?<br> Pilar, the same<br> with the sawmill post.<br> Not a shot to be fired<br> unless we hear the bombardment.<br> Be careful not to alarm the sentries<br> unless you hear the bombs.<br> Don't worry about the retreat, Ingles.<br> We'll have plenty of horses.<br> Get along, Ingles, before he steals<br> the rest of your things.<br> You don't understand me, woman.<br> We understand each other.<br> Nobody understands you; neither God<br> nor your mother nor I nor you, either.<br> Come.<br> Good-bye.<br> See you soon.<br> Good-bye, Roberto.<br> Take much care.<br> Of course.<br> Don't cry.<br> - No, I don't, but come back to me.<br> - I will.<br> Don't worry if you hear firing;<br> there's bound to be much firing.<br> Only come back quickly.<br> Bye, Maria.<br> Salud, Roberto.<br> Get across the gorge now.<br> Don't fire unless I do.<br> When the sentry is eliminated, come to<br> the middle of the bridge and help me.<br> It is all clear to me.<br> I will do as you order.<br> Listen, old one, when you fire, don't<br> think of it as a man but as a target.<br> And remember,<br> if anything happens to me,<br> you'll have to finish the job<br> as I showed you.<br> Go now.<br> - Until soon, Roberto.<br> - Until soon, Anselmo.<br> Captain Gomez, 65th Brigade. We have<br> an urgent dispatch for General Golz.<br> - Why didn't this get here sooner?<br> - Stupidity, Colonel Duval!<br> Ignorance and stupidity<br> and crazy suspicion!<br> General Golz! Urgent!<br> But I just spoke<br> to him. Huh?<br> Position Segovia?<br> I try there.<br> No, no, no!<br> Get me position Avila!<br> Where's General Golz?<br> Planes one?<br> - Get me planes one.<br> - Can't you call the airfield?<br> General Golz? Not there?<br> I called Segovia!<br> Get me Segovia again!<br> Quick, man!<br> Call the airfield.<br> Stop the bombardment.<br> You think I want to get shot?<br> Yes, Golz, Golz!<br> General Golz?<br> From Jordan?<br> Yes, read it.<br> What?<br> Too late, Duval.<br> That means we're done for.<br> This time we fail.<br> Too bad.<br> Yes... too bad.<br> Rope.<br> Hand grenade.<br> Other side.<br> Please have him be all right because all<br> my heart and all of me is at the bridge.<br> Please bring him back to me,<br> and I'll do anything You say ever.<br> 'Cause there isn't any me.<br> I'm not here anymore. I'm only with him.<br> Please! Please take care<br> of him for me!<br> Take care of him!<br> Oh, forgive me,<br> for I'm very confused.<br> I'm too confused now,<br> but if You take care of him for me,<br> I'll do whatever is right.<br> But this not knowing<br> I cannot endure! I cannot!<br> He...<br> Pablo, I got me a... a tank!<br> - One.<br> - Two.<br> - Three.<br> Four!<br> All right. Now take the wire<br> back as far as it'll reach...<br> before I connect it.<br> Roberto!<br> Roberto!<br> Hurry!<br> Roberto!<br> Hurry!<br> - Blow it, Anselmo! Blow it!<br> - No, I can't!<br> - You'll be...<br> - Pull it, I tell you! Pull it!<br> No, no, Roberto!<br> Maria!<br> Maria!<br> Your Ingles is all right.<br> - Hear me? He's all right.<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Roberto!<br> - The old one?<br> - Dead.<br> We lost Fernando.<br> If I'd had the exploder,<br> the old man would be alive.<br> What passes below? Doesn't Pablo<br> know that the bridge is gone?<br> - Maybe he can't leave.<br> - Then let us leave. The devil with him!<br> Wait! He'll be back if he's able.<br> Machine gun.<br> Here comes the...<br> Plenty of horses now,<br> Ingles.<br> Where's Fernando?<br> And the old man?<br> Where are the three men<br> from the band of Elias?<br> What were you shooting in the gorge?<br> - Why don't you say you shot them?<br> - Shut up.<br> - Answer me!<br> - I look after my own people.<br> - And the men of Elias?<br> - They were not our people!<br> - I provide horses for my people!<br> - We have horses to spare.<br> Yeah? How did I know<br> we would have three killed?<br> Now shut up.<br> I lead the retreat.<br> - No.<br> - Don't be stubborn, woman.<br> - Watch the Maria.<br> - Watch yourself.<br> Miran!<br> Wait for the next shot,<br> then go hard before they can reload.<br> No.<br> - Now!<br> - No!<br> Aah! Roberto!<br> Robert...<br> Let me go!<br> Roberto!<br> What is it? Is it...<br> - It's broken.<br> - Can you ride?<br> Get me a strip of canvas.<br> Tear it from one of the packs.<br> Get me the machine gun.<br> You can make it all right<br> to the Gredos if I hold 'em here.<br> - No, Ingles. We'll carry you.<br> - Don't argue. I can't ride.<br> I couldn't even sit on a horse.<br> I'd... pass out.<br> Pablo knows I'm right.<br> I wanna talk to Maria alone.<br> But when I tell you to take her, take<br> her. She'll want to stay, but take her.<br> Talk fast, Ingles. The soldiers will<br> soon be coming through the gorge.<br> Maria, listen.<br> Don't... Don't say anything.<br> We won't be going to America this time.<br> But always I go with you<br> wherever you go. Understand?<br> - You go now, Maria.<br> - No. No, I stay with you, Roberto.<br> No, Maria. What I do now, I do alone.<br> I couldn't do it if you were here.<br> If you go, then I go too.<br> Don't you see how it is?<br> - Whichever one there is, is both.<br> - No! No! I stay with you.<br> No. Each of us<br> must do this thing alone.<br> - Must do alone. Do it for each other.<br> - No!<br> But if you go, then I go with you.<br> That way, I go too.<br> I know you'll go now, Maria, for both of<br> us, because we love each other always.<br> It's easier for me<br> to stay with you, Roberto.<br> I know it's harder for you,<br> but now I am you also.<br> If you go, I go too.<br> That's the only way I can go.<br> You're me now. Surely<br> you must feel that, Maria.<br> Remember last night?<br> Our time is now...<br> and it'll never end.<br> - No.<br> - You're me now and I am you.<br> Now you understand.<br> Now you're going.<br> And you're going well<br> and fast and far...<br> and we'll go to America<br> another time, Maria.<br> Stand up now and go and we both go.<br> Stand up, Maria.<br> Remember, you're me too. You're all<br> there will ever be of me. Stand up.<br> - I wan...<br> - No, stand up.<br> There's no good-bye, Maria,<br> because we're not apart. Pilar.<br> No, don't turn around.<br> Go now. Be strong.<br> Take care of our life.<br> No! No, Pilar, I can't go!<br> No!<br> Oh, Roberto!<br> Roberto, let me stay!<br> Please! Please don't make me go!<br> No, let me go!<br> No!<br> Roberto! Roberto!<br> God, that was<br> lucky I could make her go.<br> I don't mind this at all now.<br> They're away.<br> Think how it would be<br> if they'd got Maria instead of you.<br> Don't pass out, Jordan.<br> Think about America.<br> I can't.<br> Think about Madrid.<br> I can't.<br> Think about... Maria.<br> I can do that, all right.<br> No, you fool!<br> You weren't kidding Maria<br> about that talk of now.<br> Now they can't stop us ever!<br> She's going on with me!<br> Yes!<br>
