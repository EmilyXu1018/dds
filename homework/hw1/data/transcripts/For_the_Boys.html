Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> Hello.<br> You know, there is one piece of<br> women's apparel I don't quite understand.<br> The one with the straps,<br> the buttons, the hooks.<br> - It's a brassiere!<br> - It's harder to get off than a parachute.<br> That's why I always offer to help.<br> Well, hi.<br> Hello.<br> Thought you'd never get here.<br> So sorry. Little trouble over<br> the Channel, you know, old pip.<br> Really?<br> Righto. We were halfway to Belgium when<br> we ran out of "gas", I believe you call it.<br> That's funny. You don't look like<br> you'd ever run out of gas.<br> Are you trying to get<br> into my flak suit, honey?<br> I'm just trying to debrief you.<br> So, a plane without any gas.<br> What did you do?<br> Do?<br> Yeah, do.<br> To keep up morale and all that.<br> Well, my copilot, lovely young boy<br> but terrified half out of his wits,<br> you know, nervous, terrified.<br> I said to him<br> "This one's going to take<br> a long, hard, pull."<br> So I did!<br> For two hours.<br> Two hours alone with you...<br> that boy deserves a Purple Heart.<br> It was purple all right,<br> but I don't think it was his heart.<br> I think I've gotta take a cold shower now.<br> How about a song before we all get arrested?<br> I'd love to.<br> Here she is, direct from the convent,<br> the wonderful Miss Dixie Leonard.<br> I want her and her mouth<br> on the next plane outta here.<br> All right, OK, all right, all right.<br> So are we being attacked?<br> I always like to know these things.<br> - We lost power. Give us a minute or two.<br> - Why you gotta yell?<br> Well, alone in the dark<br> with thousands of men.<br> There is a god after all.<br> - Come on, sweetheart. Sing!<br> - Yeah!<br> There's only one thing I like to do<br> in the dark, honey, and it ain't sing.<br> Oh, my.<br> Well, if you feel that way about it.<br> "PS I Love You" in A.<br> - Is that for me or the guy on the generator?<br> - You!<br> I love you. I had the best time.<br> Thank you.<br> It was... It was...<br> Mr Sparks.<br> - Is there something wrong?<br> - Yeah, honey. You. You're wrong.<br> You got a toilet for a mouth.<br> I don't appreciate it.<br> A lot of these boys are gonna die<br> and you wanna send them off<br> with a bunch of cheap-ass<br> dick jokes, is that it?<br> - No, sir. I just thought...<br> - You thought?<br> If you haven't got the class,<br> you oughta have the brains.<br> - OK, Eddie, enough.<br> - What?<br> - You made your point.<br> - There are a lot of writers without nieces.<br> Eddie.<br> How about that?<br> The fabulous Dixie Leonard.<br> Really nice work, Dixie.<br> How about a hand<br> for the very lovely Vicki Lee?<br> Not to mention my number one man,<br> Wally Fields and the boys.<br> Well, that's our show.<br> I hope you liked it.<br> You.<br> - No autographs, fellas.<br> - Sam, it's all right.<br> Just a few.<br> Eddie, that new stuff I put in tonight,<br> did you like it?<br> Not now, honey. That's it.<br> I don't need this.<br> I've been working in clubs since I'm 16.<br> Dixie, when I first started with Eddie,<br> he fired me every day for a week.<br> - It's a squall. It passes over.<br> - He's a racehorse. It's a different set of rules.<br> He knows what happened out there.<br> He's no fool.<br> - He's an evil, sadistic son of a bitch.<br> - He happens to be right about the dick jokes.<br> He kept setting me up.<br> What did he expect?<br> Come on, Dixie.<br> You panicked and went for the crotch.<br> We get to the hotel and you apologise.<br> What did I do? I got a few laughs,<br> I brought down the house, I topped him.<br> - You're supposed to.<br> - We're gonna build the act around that.<br> - What are you talking about?

Right through the heart.<br> I mean, if I had one.<br> That's enough. Sit down,<br> have a drink, for Christ's sakes.<br> No, I'm gonna get some sleep.<br> I'm sorry it didn't work out.<br> Dixie.<br> I give up.

He's earned it.<br> This is presented on behalf of the president<br> of the United States and a grateful nation.<br> Thank you.<br> Do you wanna come with me?<br> What do you say?<br> Come on.<br> - That son of ours is really something.<br> - What happened?<br> Last night I'm tucking him in bed.<br> He says "Is kissing dirty?"<br> - What'd you tell him?<br> - Only if you do it right.<br> Hold it. Dixie, the line is<br> "Only if you don't brush your teeth."<br> - Yeah, but my line's funny.<br> - Here we go again. What do you wanna do?<br> She can't say that. She can't say it.<br> You wrote the line. You tell her.<br> - Censor says no, Dixie.<br> - Screw the censor. Maybe that's the answer.<br> What do you say, Jack?<br> Four o'clock, Hotel Edison, Room 809?<br> Let's everybody take five, OK?<br> Dixie, it's me, for Christ's sakes.<br> Leave me alone, Eddie.<br> I don't wanna talk about it.<br> - What are you gonna do? The way he says?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Harold, take a hike, will you?<br> - It's Danny.<br> He's cutting school,<br> he doesn't come home at night.<br> - He's 12 years old.

You talk to me.<br> I'm asking you a question.<br> I don't know, all right?<br> It's like you said, OK? Me and some guys,<br> we go to the movies or hang out.<br> You sound like a bunch of guys<br> in an old-age home.<br> Do you really hate school that much?<br> - But you gotta go.<br> - Why?<br> Because it's the law. Because I say so.<br> Because your father wanted you to.<br> What the hell kind of question is that?<br> - Uncle Eddie never went past the fifth grade.<br> - Uncle Eddie isn't an example of anything.<br> Dixie, for God's sake... places!<br> And now it's time for The Bailey's Comedy<br> Hour with Eddie Sparks and Dixie Leonard.<br> Brought to you by Bailey's Foods,<br> makers of Bailey's coffee<br> and other fine products for your table.<br> Hold four.

Push the button.<br> What do you say?<br> Well, Eddie, as long as<br> we're talking about helping the boys,<br> now would be a good time to share<br> with everyone the magnificent gesture<br> that this man made today.<br> There's a time for speaking out<br> and a time to be modest.<br> I know that all your fans will be delighted<br> to know that earlier today<br> Eddie made a personal contribution<br> to the International Red Cross of $100,000.<br> What a guy!<br> That's my bonus.<br> We're out of time, folks.<br> Me!

Sign a petition.<br> - These guys control the network.<br> He's your friend.<br> Tell 'em to go to hell.<br> I'm not committing suicide<br> for Art or anyone.<br> You are so full of shit.<br> You're worse than they are.<br> Who did this? Who did this?<br> Was it you, Luanna?<br> You smug bitch.<br> Did you put my uncle's name on a list?<br> Did you? What are you smiling at? You did.<br> Or you, Sam, was it you?<br> Or you? Or you, or you?<br> Who's next, fellas? Rudolph? He's got<br> a red nose too. We can't be too careful.<br> Hey! I got a great idea!<br> Let's form a club.<br> Everybody who joins gets a button...<br> "I got screwed by Eddie Sparks."<br> - Don't worry, Eddie. She doesn't mean it.<br> - Come on, we're going home.<br> - It's OK, son. She's just tired.<br> - Look at him. See who he really is.<br> This man threw your Uncle Art out<br> like a piece of garbage.<br> You wanna grow up to be like him?<br> Sure, turn your wife into a drunk.<br> - Use people up and throw 'em away!<br> - It's OK, Eddie.<br> - And he's gonna throw you away too!<br> - It's OK, son.<br> Come on.<br> He's a monster! Come to me! Come to Mom.<br> Mom...<br> You can't have him!<br> You keep your hands off my son!<br> It's OK, son. It's OK.<br> I believe that our generation<br> will change the world.<br> I believe in freedom and honour,<br> hard work and the genius<br> of the American system.<br> I believe in the need to protect that system<br> with strength and justice and compassion<br> wherever it is threatened.<br> I believe in respect for rank<br> and the wisdom of our founding fathers.<br> I believe in America.<br> To love it and defend it as my father did<br> with the ultimate sacrifice.<br> I believe in the importance of family,<br> in my mother and her spirit.<br> What the hell could I do?<br> There was Eddie every time I turned around.<br> And you know what? Danny loved him.<br> I never had a chance.<br> - And you and Eddie?<br> - We hardly spoke.<br> Network dropped me like a hot potato.<br> They said I was...<br> - Controversial?<br> - Bingo.<br> That was me. Isn't that a hoot?<br> Me, who always thought Karl Marx<br> was the sixth Marx brother after Zeppo.<br> Eddie stayed with the show but...<br> it never really worked.<br> Cancelled him after a season.<br> - So what did you do?<br> - What did I do? What didn't I do?<br> Dinner theatre, stock, club dates.<br> Saved up a little money, bought myself<br> a little bistro in Hollywood.<br> A jazz club.<br> I liked it. Friends would come by.<br> And Danny?<br> Danny.<br> - Bring him back here,<br> - Remember to stop the bleeding!<br> These frantic efforts were to no avail,<br> The wounded man was dead,<br> Purple smoke marks the landing zone as<br> the medevac helicopter arrives minutes later,<br> - Twice in one week?<br> - I'm a fan.<br> Thank you.<br> Eddie called. Couple of weeks ago.<br> He called a lot, actually.<br> I went over, we got to talking.<br> He gave an interview about me<br> in the LA Times,<br> The whole blacklisting thing<br> is coming out this Sunday.<br> You know what he said?<br> "I don't much about Art,<br> but I know what I like."<br> Very clever line.<br> Did you write it for him?<br> I can't drag it around any more.<br> I don't wanna end up<br> writing for Beat the Clock,<br> Art, you're my uncle and I love you.<br> Do what you gotta do, all right?<br> There's a kicker.<br> The network wants a special.<br> Eddie Sparks' 25th anniversary<br> of the first tour.<br> - They're throwing money at him.<br> - America, the land of the fee.<br> Two weeks in Vietnam.<br> We got Loretta, Wally,<br> everybody from the old group.<br> - Not everybody.<br> - At least hear him out.<br> Would you do that? For me?<br> For old times. We owe him, Dixie.<br> I owe him, all right.<br> He's outside.<br> He was afraid to come in. He's out there<br> sitting in the goddamn limousine.<br> Can I tell him it's OK to come in?<br> He sent you in here for this?<br> Who's he gonna send?<br> Sam's dead. The girls are gone.<br> Margaret's left him. We're all he's got.<br> Come here.<br> - Look, it's Eddie Sparks, right there.<br> - Oh, yeah. Look, Eddie Sparks.<br> - Hi, Mr Sparks. How you doing?<br> - Hi. I'm looking for Dixie.<br> - She's waiting for you right over there.<br> - Thanks.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> It's Eddie Sparks!<br> - Mind if I sit down?<br> - It's a free country.<br> So far, anyway.<br> So...<br> Art, you spoke to him, yeah?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - So what do you think?<br> - I think your hairpiece is too tight.<br> It's starting to affect your brain.<br> Always with the quips.<br> You know, you and me.<br> You and me.<br> Back together again. We could show 'em.<br> Dixie, I wanna do it again.<br> Big show, big audience.<br> Not this television shit,<br> I mean 10,000.<br> That sound, remember?<br> Oh, my.<br> I wanna do it again.<br> What do you say? One more time.<br> - I'm not in the business.<br> - Look...<br> We could see Danny.<br> Look. He writes to me all the time.<br> He writes to me all the time.<br> Here, look, look.<br> Saigon... Now, look...<br> Look, Danny. Danny, Danny...<br> Look, I got friends.<br> State Department, four-star generals,<br> the president, they owe me.<br> Don't do this.<br> I could get us in. Don't you wanna<br> see your boy? Don't you wanna see him?<br> I do. Come on. You wanna see him, right?<br> You son of a bitch.<br> Hey, why is he following the road?<br> - Cos he's afraid to fly over the jungle.<br> - Afraid? Of being seen?<br> A lot of VC, right?<br> I'll be straight with you, Eddie.<br> I don't like this.<br> You got no business being here.<br> I can't guarantee your safety.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> - There it is.<br> - Where? Over there?<br> Oh, my God.<br> You got one hour to do what you gotta do<br> and then we're outta here. Got it?<br> Where is he?<br> He's out checking perimeter guards.<br> He'll be back in a while.<br> Get your choppers back here by 1430 hours.<br> I can't guarantee air cover after that.<br> Don't worry. We got a big show<br> in Bien Hoa tonight.<br> That's certainly a lot of guys.<br> I'd like to get a look<br> at the stage area if I could.<br> I know the men<br> are gonna really enjoy the show.<br> - I hope so.<br> - Yeah.<br> Thank you, Major.<br> Pretty exciting, huh?<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> Yeah? Help you, son?<br> So I finally got you two<br> in the same room.<br> Danny.<br> - Danny, Danny, Danny.<br> - Ma.<br> It's OK. It's OK, Ma.<br> Hello, son.<br> Good to see you again.<br> You're mixing it up pretty good,<br> I hear, huh? Huh?<br> Sir?<br> Charlie action, firefights, like that.<br> Yeah.<br> They're out there.<br> You look like hell.<br> I'm fine. I'm fine, Ma.<br> I can't tell you how damn proud we are<br> of what you're doing here.<br> We're gonna beat<br> those little bastards, you know.<br> Yes, sir.<br> As soon as we find 'em.<br> - Williams.<br> - Captain Danny.<br> - O'Connor.<br> - Hi, Captain.<br> Come on.<br> What? What is it, Danny?<br> Honey, talk to me, for God's sake.<br> It's a shame, really.<br> Such a beautiful country.<br> I don't know how it's ever gonna<br> come back from all this.<br> - He doesn't get it, does he?<br> - Honey, don't say that.<br> He moved heaven and earth<br> to bring us here.<br> With the cameras.<br> - He's gonna get it all on film, right?<br> - Why are you surprised?<br> What have you been writing him<br> all this time?<br> What he wanted to hear.<br> - What'd you want me to write?<br> - The truth.<br> The truth?<br> See that kid up there?<br> The corporal?<br> Yeah.<br> He's a sweet kid.<br> He's from Chicago.<br> His father's a schoolteacher.<br> He collects ears.<br> He cuts the ears off of dead bodies.<br> He's got a hell<br> of a little collection of 'em.<br> In 20, 25 years...<br> he's gonna sell them stateside, he says.<br> I gotta send him home.<br> He's only 19 years old and he's gone.<br> It's a nightmare.<br> Please.<br> You know, Eddie, he's got a lot of friends.<br> He could get you out of here.<br> I'm a captain, Mom.<br> I got men under me here.<br> And anyway....<br> it'd break Eddie's heart.<br> I went to the doctor.<br> He said my sex life was all in my head.<br> I said "Yeah, I know,<br> I want it lowered."<br> You gotta laugh or else they're gonna sell me<br> to the VC for target practice.<br> - Where are the girls?<br> - Girls!<br> - Girls!<br> - Hold it. Did I hear girls?<br> We got girls!<br> We got girls!<br> Hey, Janie, come here!<br> Hey, hey, hey!<br> Hold it, hold it.<br> Hold it, hold it. Guys, guys, guys.<br> Come here, come here.<br> Let's have a hand<br> for little Janie Perkins.<br> She'll be back later.<br> She's gonna do more later. Lighten up.<br> Now back off here a little bit.<br> I got a special treat for you guys.<br> I'm gonna tell you now.<br> You know your captain Danny Leonard?<br> Hell of a man, hell of a man.<br> His mother...<br> His mother flew 12,000 miles<br> to be with him and to be with you.<br> Best singer I've ever heard.<br> She's here for you guys.<br> Let me bring her out.<br> The wonderful Miss Dixie Leonard.<br> Dixie! Dixie!<br> All right, shut up.<br> Shut up!<br> You guys are the sorriest bunch of grunts<br> I ever saw in my life.<br> Where the hell did you learn<br> your manners?<br> Don't you know you're supposed to say<br> "excuse me" before you attack a lady?<br> Show us your tits, Mama!<br> I would, sonny,<br> but you'd probably have a heart attack.<br> All right, shut the fuck up.<br> It's Christmas time.<br> Gonna sing a little song for you.<br> I need stuff like Danny listening.<br> He's not in the audience.<br> I can't find him.<br> Keep looking, will you?<br> Incoming!<br> Drop! Drop!<br> Move it! Move it! Move it!<br> Get down in there, you hear me?<br> Don't come out!<br> We flew back with him<br> on the plane, Eddie and me,<br> And... we buried him,<br> and we never spoke again,<br> Listen, why don't you just relax?<br> Just close your eyes<br> for a couple of minutes, OK?<br> Do that for me?<br> I'll be right back.<br> The thing you wanna avoid<br> is outlasting everybody.<br> Can you remember that?<br> Sure.<br> Good.<br> Just close your eyes.<br> I've gotta...<br> I'm gonna be right back, OK?<br> Just two minutes, OK?<br> Where the hell are you? We go in 20 minutes.<br> Eddie's asking for her.<br> Forget it. You don't want her<br> on the stage with him. Not on live TV.<br> - What happened?<br> - Her life.<br> Jesus, don't get poetic with me,<br> you little putz!<br> - Listen, it won't work, Stan.<br> - OK, dump her and get your ass down here.<br> I don't think so, Stan.<br> She needs to be with somebody.<br> Is everything all right?<br> Go see if Joan Collins<br> is out in the audience.<br> Miss Leonard?<br> Jesus. Miss Leonard, are you all right?<br> Miss Leonard! Miss Leonard!<br> Miss Leonard.<br> Open this door, goddammit! Dixie!<br> It opens out, genius.<br> You're dressed.<br> Balenciaga. What do you think?<br> You look beautiful.<br> You thought I was taking<br> a bunch of sleeping pills.<br> No, I...<br> This dress cost me.<br> I ain't gonna waste it. Let's go.<br> You're gonna do it?<br> He can't handle that by himself.<br> And that better be a stretch limo<br> or you're in deep shit.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Stand by with the girls, please.<br> Ready to cue the girls in and cue 'em in.<br> And ready, boys.<br> And dissolve... Send them in.<br> - She's coming!<br> - Here she is!<br> Miss Leonard! Can we have a picture?<br> Come on, back off. Back off!<br> Let her through!<br> Come on, Miss Leonard.<br> Please!<br> - Keep the hands in.<br> - What?<br> - She's here.<br> - Great. Get her into make-up quick.<br> Standby on two. And take it.<br> Get outta the way.<br> Miss Leonard, I'm Stan.<br> I'm the producer.<br> This is such an honour.<br> We're thrilled you decided to come.<br> - Where's Eddie?<br> - No time for that.<br> After this number we go to commercial,<br> then the tape of the president's greeting,<br> then the film clips, then we intro<br> Senator Ramsey for the presentation,<br> then you and Eddie, "Glad to be here",<br> couple of shticks, then you do your thing.<br> - Sounds lovely.<br> - Five minutes,<br> - Where?<br> - Make-up.<br> - This way.<br> - Right over there.<br> Where are you going?<br> Hey, kid, I am talking to you.<br> Son of a bitch still makes me nervous.<br> You go easy on him.<br> Remember, he's an endangered species.<br> Ain't we all?<br> - Thank you.<br> - For what?<br> You know, showing up,<br> being a pushy assistant.<br> Ex pushy assistant.<br> You got a bigger talent,<br> like your mother says.<br> You can fix things.<br> - Goodbye, Miss Leonard.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Ooh!<br> Miss Leonard! I can't believe it.<br> I'm Lou Presti, Eddie's manager.<br> Eddie, look who's here.<br> You won't believe it.<br> Well, the "late" Dixie Leonard.<br> - Hello, Eddie.<br> - Lou, that's five dollars you owe me.<br> - You got it.<br> - We had a little side bet.<br> He said "She's not coming. Forget about it.<br> She can't take the pressure."<br> I said "This one, you don't know."<br> Couldn't stay away, huh?<br> That's a Leica, isn't it?<br> Right. That's very good.<br> Are you a photographer, Miss Leonard?<br> No, but my husband was. May I see that?<br> Sure, sure.<br> - It's kinda heavy. Be careful.<br> - Yes, I see. Oh, my. Yes.<br> Don't touch that.<br> What the hell are you doin'?<br> - Those are all my shots!<br> - You want pictures of me, you ask me.<br> Lou, Lou.<br> - Clear the room.<br> - Please, would you mind, everybody?<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Eddie...<br> Please, please.<br> So I see the years<br> have not mellowed you.<br> You want mellow,<br> buy yourself a Rudy Vallee record.<br> Funny.<br> Listen up. You cleared the room.<br> Now what?<br> - I don't know. I thought we could talk.<br> - I don't wanna talk. I wanna get ready.<br> Yeah, but I wanna talk.<br> About what?<br> How about sleep? Old people<br> are always talking about sleep.<br> - How you been sleeping lately, Eddie?<br> - Me? Like a baby. How about yourself?<br> Not so good.<br> I dream a lot. Then I wake up.<br> - You should try some warm milk.<br> - No. I like the dreams.<br> They're very enlightening.<br> Do you believe<br> in the unconscious, Eddie?<br> Personally, I prefer the conscious.<br> They pay more attention.<br> You still got your touch, Eddie. Even though<br> you do look like a goddamn turtle.<br> - Thank you. You look good yourself.<br> - Thanks. Mind if I smoke?<br> - I don't care if you burn.<br> - What a prince.<br> I had a doosey of a dream last night.<br> You were in it. You wanna hear it?<br> - No.<br> - It was fantastic.<br> I dreamed I died and went to heaven.<br> And the angels... the angels told me<br> I could ask God one question.<br> So I said... I was very excited...<br> I said "God, first you took Michael."<br> "I sort of understand that. He was wild.<br> He was reckless. Fantastic in bed."<br> "OK, so Michael."<br> "But then Danny too.<br> Why'd you take 'em both? I gotta know."<br> And you know what God said?<br> He said "It's the price."<br> I said "What for?"<br> He said "It's the price for the good times,<br> for the fun, for the laughs,<br> for the applause, for the career,<br> for you and Eddie."<br> "Think there's a free lunch, girlie?"<br> He talked like he was from the William Morris<br> office. In fact, that's who I think he is.<br> Yeah. So now you're through?<br> No.<br> We did it.<br> We put a uniform on him.<br> - Don't do this.<br> - He loved us and we put him in the ground.<br> All right.<br> It's 25 years. I can't go on like this.<br> I need you. I can't do it alone.<br> You listen to me, you crazy bitch!<br> I never killed nobody!<br> I never started the wars.<br> I'm not a fucking general!<br> I'm a song-and-dance man.<br> We went out there and we made 'em forget<br> for a couple of hours.<br> - It's not that simple.<br> - I'm proud of what we done, Dixie.<br> I'm proud of every minute.<br> I'm proud of every show. It was an honour.<br> - A sacred honour.<br> - Dixie and Eddie, places,<br> Dixie...<br> I know he died.<br> Him and a million others.<br> Why don't you mourn for them?<br> - I do.<br> - Well, so do I.<br> So do I! But you pick yourself up. You don't<br> waste your life and chew on this thing!<br> I didn't waste my life.<br> I made something of my life.<br> I gave birth to him.<br> I nursed him. I sang him to sleep.<br> And they massacred him.<br> For what? For honour!<br> Fuck honour! I want my son back!<br> I don't need this.<br> I don't need you.<br> I don't need anybody.<br> Go on, you old fraud.<br> Get your medal.<br> I hope it was worth it.<br> ..and, certainly,<br> none more distinctly American<br> than the two people<br> we honour here tonight.<br> On behalf of the president,<br> it is my great pleasure<br> to present the National Medal of the Arts<br> to Eddie Sparks and Dixie Leonard.<br> Where is she?<br> Anybody have any idea where she is?<br> Take one and cover it. We're on one.<br> Three, swing round<br> and get some audience.<br> Bravo!<br> I should do this well at my funeral!<br> Seriously...<br> This is a great honour.<br> A great, great honour.<br> And Dixie, she couldn't be<br> with us tonight.<br> She's a little under the weather.<br> But I know she's watching.<br> So hang in there, honey. We love you.<br> We both want you to know<br> that we share this honour<br> with all the young Americans<br> who laid down their lives<br> for the greatest country<br> in all the world.<br> On the beaches of Normandy...<br> the Philippines...<br> Korea...<br> Vietnam...<br> Come on. Eddie, what? Let's go.<br> Stand by with a commercial.<br> Vietnam...<br> Vietnam...<br> A small... A small fire base on...<br> Christmas Day, 1969.<br> They...<br> They just came at us out of the sun.<br> And we lost our boy.<br> To tell you the truth, I...<br> I haven't been sleeping so good,<br> Not so good,<br> Because I loved him<br> like he was my own son.<br> I loved him very, very much,<br> Danny... I...<br> Here she is. I need the spots on her.<br> Oh, how great!<br> Pipe down, pipe down, will you?<br> You know, when I...<br> When I first met him, he was nothing.<br> Doing it single.<br> Bad suit.<br> Impersonations, song parodies.<br> Terrible.<br> But I saw some potential there<br> and I took him under my wing,<br> and I taught him the business.<br> I taught him the moves,<br> the songs, the timing.<br> I even taught him<br> how to impersonate a human being.<br> Thank you.<br> You're very welcome.<br> You know...<br> for an old broad,<br> you're still pretty sexy.<br> How would you know?<br> Well, I think I'm getting excited.<br> Let me know when you're sure.<br> Hey, Dixie, they gave me<br> a big suite upstairs.<br> - Really?<br> - Yeah.<br> And I got a big king-size bed.<br> - You wanna lie down, Eddie?<br> - Is that an offer?<br> It's a recommendation.<br> Look at this. I'm 91 years old.<br> - Dixie, please let's go upstairs.<br> - What, to your room?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Ohh!<br> - And then we get undressed?<br> - Yeah.<br> - And then we get into bed?<br> - Yeah.<br> And then what?<br> Maybe we'd better dance.<br> Thank goodness she showed up.<br> There is a Santa Claus!<br> Wonderful. Stand by, music.<br> I'm coming, sweetheart. Are you ready?<br> - Wait. I gotta find my feet.<br> - They're there. Trust me.<br> - You ready now?<br> - Don't hurt yourself.<br> Don't worry. And five, six...<br>
