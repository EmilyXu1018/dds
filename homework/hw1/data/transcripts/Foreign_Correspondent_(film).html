                        - What's new?<br> - Same old daily bunkeroo.<br> Mr. Powers says he wants to see<br> that foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.<br> Don't declare war for a few minutes.<br> "According to a high official,<br> it is believed"...<br> Foreign correspondent.<br> I could get more news out of Europe<br> looking in the crystal ball.<br> That Stebbins cable has a morsel in it.<br> Stebbins makes me sick.<br> They all make me sick.<br> Europe about to blow up...<br> and all I can get from my foreign staff<br> is a daily guessing game.<br> - I want some facts, Mr. Bradley.<br> - For instance?<br> Any kind of fact.<br> There must be something<br> going on in Europe...<br> beside a nervous breakdown.<br> Why not try sending me over, Mr. Powers?<br> You've written a book<br> on economics or something.<br> The Twilight of Feudalism?<br> - Yes. It was very well received.<br> - Not by me.<br> I don't want any more economists, sages,<br> or oracles bombinating over our cable.<br> I want a reporter.<br> Someone who doesn't know the difference<br> between an ism and a kangaroo.<br> A good, honest crime reporter.<br> That's what the Globe needs.<br> That's what Europe needs.<br> There's a crime hatching<br> on that bedeviled continent.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I've got something<br> that might pass for an idea.<br> Who was that fellow that ran down<br> the payroll robbery last week?<br> You mean Johnny Jones.<br> He beat up a policeman, didn't he,<br> in the line of duty?<br> Yes. There's some talk at the city desk<br> of firing him.<br> Beat up a policeman?<br> Sounds ideal for Europe.<br> Send Mr. Jones up here right away.<br> - Mr. Powers wants to see you, Mr. Jones.<br> - He does?<br> - You should come to his office right away.<br> - What about?<br> I ain't in his confidence.<br> Tell him to save his breath.<br> Tell him I've resigned.<br> - I'm supposed to bring you there.<br> - Okay. Wait till I open this.<br> Where's Mr. Jones?<br> I told you to send him right up here!<br> - Are you Mr. Jones?<br> - Yes.<br> Sit down, please.<br> - You mind a personal question?<br> - No.<br> - Are you married?<br> - No luck.<br> Single?<br> - Ever been in Europe?<br> - No.<br> What's your opinion<br> of the present European crisis, Mr. Jones?<br> What crisis?<br> I'm referring to<br> the impending war, Mr. Jones.<br> That. To tell you the truth,<br> I haven't given it much thought.<br> You don't keep up<br> with our foreign news, do you?<br> If you're gonna fire me,<br> you can scrap the intelligence test.<br> It's perfectly okay with me.<br> I can get a job on any newspaper in town<br> within an hour. So long.<br> Wait a minute. Nobody fired you.<br> How would you like to cover<br> the biggest story in the world today?<br> With an expense account,<br> I'll cover anything.<br> You'll get an expense account.<br> - Okay, what's the story?<br> - Europe.<br> I'm afraid I'm not exactly equipped,<br> but I could read up.<br> No reading up. I like you just as you are.<br> What Europe needs<br> is a fresh, unused mind.<br> - Foreign correspondent?<br> - No. Reporter.<br> I don't want correspondence. I want news.<br> - Can you dig up some news in Europe?<br> - I'll be happy to try, sir.<br> This is what I mean:<br> Mr. Van Meer, when questioned<br> by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins...<br> refused to open his mouth.<br> A 1,200-word cable told...<br> to the fact that<br> the great Van Meer had nothing to say.<br> Know what that's doing? It's driving<br> our readers crazy with frustration.<br> - Who's Van Meer?<br> - Keynote to the European situation today.<br> If Van Meer stays<br> at the helm of his country's affairs...<br> for the next three months,<br> it may mean peace in Europe.<br> If we knew what he was thinking<br> we'd know where Europe stands.<br> - German?<br> - No. Holland's strongman.<br> One of the two signers<br> of the Dutch treaty with Belgium.<br> Now, this is your first assignment.<br> I want you to talk with him...<br> find out what's in that treaty,<br> and what he thinks will happen. Facts.<br> - Van Meer?<br> - Right.<br> - Anybody else?<br> - No.<br> How about Hitler?<br> Don't you think we should pump him?<br> He must have something on his mind.<br> - Yes?<br> - Mr. Stephen Fisher to see you.<br> Tell him to come in.<br> Ever hear of Stephen Fisher?<br> - I'm afraid he's not on my beat.<br> - He is from now on.<br> He's head of the Universal Peace Party<br> and very close to Van Meer.<br> They're both working<br> to prevent Europe going up in flames.<br> How do you do, Mr. Fisher?<br> Nice of you to come over.<br> - Sit down.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr. Fisher, Mr. Jones,<br> our new foreign correspondent.<br> I want you to know each other.<br> How do you do, Mr. Jones.<br> Jones. I don't like that name.<br> It's going to handicap you, young man.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> I've got some sort of a name here.<br> Yes. Haverstock. Huntley Haverstock.<br> Sounds more important,<br> doesn't it, Mr. Fisher?<br> Yes, very dashing.<br> Sounds better than Richard Harding Davis.<br> - What's the matter with that?<br> - We can't use that.<br> That's the name of one of our<br> greatest war correspondents 40 years ago.<br> Speak up, young man. You don't mind<br> being Huntley Haverstock, do you?<br> A rose by any name, sir.<br> It's exciting being present at the<br> christening of a newspaper correspondent.<br> Shouldrt we break<br> a bottle of champagne?<br> Break one over my head to see<br> if I'm still awake. Huntley Haverstock.<br> Mr. Haverstock, you better get started.<br> You've got a lot to do.<br> - Passports, photos, visas...<br> - Expenses.<br> I'll send a note to the cashier.<br> - I hope you brought your Sunday articles.<br> - I managed three of them.<br> - See you in London then, Mr. Haverstock.<br> - Yes, of course.<br> Thank you, Mr. Powers.<br> Thank you for everything.<br> Except Huntley Haverstock.<br> Get a load of this, Mother.<br> How's it look? Chic?<br> Don't wear it over one eye.<br> It makes you look like a dandy.<br> You always think the boys are wearing<br> their hats over one eye.<br> - Let him wear it the way it is.<br> - He'll have to wear a stovepipe in London.<br> - They call them poppers over there.<br> - Toppers.<br> Bobby, put that in the box for Uncle John,<br> will you?<br> - Let me try it on.<br> - No, I want to try it on.<br> - Now he's a regular war correspondent.<br> - Without a war.<br> I'm afraid he'll get his war.<br> - They're throwing a big bluff over there.<br> - Let's hope so.<br> How do you like the way<br> we've our little nest furnished?<br> If I were you, I'd hang lighter curtains,<br> and move that sofa out here.<br> It's too bad you haven't an open fireplace.<br> If you'd speak to the captain,<br> I think he'd attend to everything.<br> All ashore that's going ashore!<br> Now, Mother.<br> Goodbye, John.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - Thank you.<br> You're Jones?<br> I'm Stebbins, London man for the Globe.<br> Mr. Powers told me you'd probably<br> be here. Nice of you to come.<br> Reminds me. I lost mine on the way over.<br> I can say your other name, too.<br> That Huntley...<br> I could say it yesterday...<br> but I had a rather tough session<br> with the boys last night.<br> - So I'll stick to Jones if you don't mind.<br> - Jones is great with me.<br> Let's go. This crowd's making me nervous.<br> My nerves aren't in the pink.<br> Just take it easy.<br> I'll follow you right along.<br> Porter, bring those bags. And don't<br> bang them into my knees from behind.<br> What about a drink<br> after that long train ride?<br> Sounds like a very logical idea.<br> I may not act it,<br> but I've been here 25 years.<br> London man for the Globe<br> and they haven't caught onto me yet.<br> How'd you manage it?<br> Cable back the government handouts<br> and sign them...<br> "Our London correspondent."<br> - What's yours?<br> - Scotch and soda, please.<br> Miss?<br> Miss, please.<br> - Scotch and soda, and a glass of milk.<br> - A glass of milk?<br> I'm on the wagon. I went to the doctor<br> today about these jitters I got...<br> and he said it was the wagon for a month<br> or a whole new set of organs.<br> I can't afford a whole new set of organs.<br> If I'd known you're on the wagon,<br> I could have got along without this.<br> But as long as it's here...<br> Good luck.<br> Good?<br> - Yeah, just like any other Scotch and soda.<br> - That's what I thought.<br> Doesrt taste the way it did<br> when I was a baby. That's got poison in it.<br> Speaking of that, I've got some pills<br> I got to take.<br> Here's some cables that have been<br> coming over from New York.<br> They love to cable. It makes them think<br> you're working for them.<br> There's an invitation to that lunch<br> for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow.<br> I guess that's your dish.<br> This is given by the Universal Peace Party.<br> That's Fisher's organization, right?<br> I don't know.<br> I don't follow those things very much.<br> New York wants it, I send it.<br> That's the secret of being a correspondent.<br> Been doing it 25 years.<br> Twenty-five years, and I end up on milk.<br> Good morning. How's the water wagon?<br> Look at that.<br> One of them shook off this morning.<br> I'm just on my way<br> to the Van Meer luncheon.<br> I'm lunching with old man Clark.<br> He's the International Press...<br> Here you are. I didn't know whether<br> to meet you in the grill or upstairs.<br> Goodbye, Stebbins. Goodbye, Miss Clark.<br> Who's he calling Clark? He's got his nerve.<br> Some fresh American reporter.<br> Good morning, Mr. Van Meer.<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> You are Mr. Van Meer, aren't you?<br> That's my name, yes.<br> I'm Haverstock. You don't know me.<br> I'm an American.<br> And I just happen to be<br> on my way to your luncheon.<br> - Then, perhaps...<br> - That's very kind of you, sir...<br> Come, come. It's all in a good cause.<br> Savoy Hotel.<br> - This is very kind of you.<br> - It's a pleasure, my boy.<br> I dislike riding alone.<br> One thinks too much while riding alone.<br> Yes, exactly. The Polish situation,<br> and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians...<br> must be on your mind<br> quite a lot these days.<br> What do you feel<br> that England will do in case the Nazis...<br> England is so beautiful.<br> It's nice to see London in the sunshine.<br> Always there's lots of rain or fog.<br> Also it is August.<br> I found out it was August.<br> That's pretty good for me.<br> Would you mind telling me...<br> how you feel about Mr. Fisher<br> and his Peace Organization?<br> You know Mr. Fisher?<br> A very fine man. And a good man.<br> I wish there were more like him<br> in the world just now.<br> I take it you don't think<br> there's much hope for peace?<br> I mean, you don't think<br> one little peace organization...<br> can make much headway<br> against the European war panic?<br> I would like to think so.<br> Look at those birds.<br> No matter how big the city,<br> there must always be parks...<br> and places for the birds to live.<br> I was walking<br> through the park this morning...<br> and I saw several people feeding the birds.<br> It's a good sign at a time like this.<br> Is it not?<br> Yes, it's a dandy sign...<br> but I do think that right now<br> birds are the least of our problems.<br> Your country, for instance.<br> What's its attitude toward these matters?<br> We're now near the Savoy.<br> - How much?<br> - A shilling.<br> That's fine.<br> By the way, young man,<br> what newspaper do you represent?<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I'm not exactly a reporter...<br> but I was trying to get you to talk.<br> I didn't want bird talk either.<br> I gathered that.<br> Just what was it<br> that you were trying to get me to tell you?<br> I'm trying to find out what you know<br> about the possibility of a general war.<br> How do you really feel about it?<br> My boy, I feel very old and sad...<br> and helpless.<br> I did have one.<br> The last news from Poland<br> was very alarming.<br> - Nobody wants a war...<br> - Then we don't have to have it.<br> You must understand, often circumstances<br> over which we've no control...<br> Yes, those convenient circumstances<br> over which we have no control.<br> It's always odd,<br> but they usually bring on a war.<br> You never hear of circumstances<br> over which we've no control...<br> rushing us into peace, do you?<br> Very determined woman, my daughter.<br> Come on. Let's go and see<br> if you can pick a fight somewhere else.<br> - Good for you.<br> - Wasrt he a bore?<br> Many won'thy people are, bless them.<br> How do you like to be fishing in Ireland<br> right now?<br> We haven't had a good sail<br> or swim together in months.<br> Not even a game of cribbage. Miss them?<br> There's the Admiral.<br> He has a weakness for you.<br> Go on. Do your stuff.<br> Here you are. The Jones that became<br> a Haverstock. Have a good trip?<br> Still wish you were Richard Harding Davis.<br> - So do I, sir. Anything except...<br> - Hello.<br> Mrs. Appleby, meet Huntley Haverstock,<br> Special Correspondent, New York Globe.<br> - Foreign correspondent? Not really.<br> - Cross my heart.<br> You look such a dear, sweet boy.<br> You don't seem a bit like the others.<br> But I'm sure you're marvelous at it.<br> Do you know a friend of mine,<br> Monte Rockingham?<br> He's in the embassy at Istanbul.<br> Or is it Honolulu?<br> Do help me with this<br> distinguished-looking gentleman here.<br> I can't make any headway with him,<br> but I'm sure he speaks some language.<br> I haven't the least idea who he is...<br> but there's nobody here<br> who isn't internationally important.<br> - This is Mr. Haver...<br> - Stock.<br> No English?<br> Try German.<br> Splendid. What else do you know?<br> - Only pig Latin.<br> - Pig Latin.<br> Here we are. This will do it.<br> Now we're getting somewhere.<br> The universal language.<br> Dear Maharajah.<br> Well, they come in pairs.<br> If you speak English,<br> give me a hand with the laughing Latvian.<br> - What's his racket? What's he talking?<br> - Latvian.<br> No kidding. I didn't know<br> the Lats had a language.<br> I thought they just rubbed noses.<br> - You mean you actually speak Latvian?<br> - Just enough to get about.<br> What does just enough to get about<br> consist of in Latvian?<br> I don't think you'd have any trouble.<br> Be a comfort to know when I get to Latvia.<br> You think there's a chance<br> of you getting to Latvia soon?<br> Never can tell in my racket.<br> I suppose you've guessed<br> I'm a foreign correspondent.<br> Are you? That's nice.<br> I see you're taking notes.<br> Are you covering this affair, too?<br> I sort of work here.<br> Publicity? You're just the one<br> I'm looking for.<br> We've got to go in a secret conference<br> right away.<br> Me? Excuse me.<br> I beg your pardon, sir.<br> I have a Latvian friend here...<br> who's particularly interested<br> in the origin of the kilt.<br> I wonder if you'd be interested<br> in talking to him. He's a lovely fellow.<br> It's a most amazing story.<br> You see, the Greeks, in the early period,<br> they used to wear a kilt.<br> Now, what is this big secret conference<br> all about?<br> It's no secret as far as I'm concerned.<br> However, I'll let you in on that later.<br> Since you're handling publicity here,<br> give me a line on what it's about...<br> this league for peace and understanding.<br> Just what is it you'd like to know?<br> In the first place, is this Mr. Fisher<br> entirely on the level?<br> Very much so.<br> - Seems like a very nice guy.<br> - He is, I assure you.<br> What is it that makes him or you<br> think that an organization like this...<br> made up of well-meaning amateurs...<br> buck up against those<br> tough military boys of Europe?<br> It's the well-meaning amateurs<br> who do the fighting when the war comes.<br> - Luncheon is served.<br> - Please don't go yet.<br> You don't want those<br> dreary chicken patties.<br> I'm sorry. I must go.<br> Then sit at the press table with me.<br> Nobody ever listens to the speeches,<br> and we could talk.<br> You don't even know my name yet.<br> - Is it necessary?<br> - It is to me.<br> Don't mind if you hear<br> it's Huntley Haverstock...<br> because it's really Jones.<br> - What's yours?<br> - Mine's really Smith.<br> Don't mind if you hear it's anything else.<br> - Waiter?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Same young lady. Try again.<br> I've taken the young lady 13 notes, sir.<br> She won't accept any more.<br> Milords, ladies and gentlemen...<br> pray silence for your chairman...<br> Mr. Stephen Fisher.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> I have an announcement to make...<br> which I'm sure will be<br> a great disappointment to us all.<br> I've just received this telegram<br> from Mr. Van Meer...<br> who was to have been<br> our guest of honor today.<br> "Deeply regret. Called away suddenly<br> owing to unforeseen circumstances.<br> "And I will be unable<br> to attend your meeting as planned.<br> "I am with you and your work<br> with all my heart.<br> "I could not have said more<br> had I been there."<br> Although this removes<br> one of our star attractions...<br> we may, as a result, have more time<br> to tell you from the inside...<br> just what this party has stood for<br> and why we've asked you here today.<br> I can think of no one<br> more competent to do this...<br> than the speaker I'm about to introduce.<br> I trust you won't think this a family affair...<br> when I say that I refer to my daughter<br> Miss Carol Fisher.<br> Milords, ladies and gentlemen...<br> pray silence for Miss Carol Fisher.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> I trust, even making allowances<br> for a father's exuberance...<br> you do not think I'm in any way<br> being put forward today...<br> as a substitute for Mr. Van Meer.<br> Unappily for us,<br> no one can take Mr. Van Meer's place.<br> What I can do possibly<br> is to clear up a few misapprehensions...<br> that have crept into<br> the public discussion of this movement...<br> and revise some of the epithets<br> that have been applied to us...<br> by some who have not gone<br> as deeply into the matter as they might.<br> The female of the species<br> is deadlier than the male.<br> ...as a group of well-meaning amateurs.<br> Now, I'm sure there's some of you<br> here today who think of us as such.<br> I'd like to ask anyone who has called us<br> well-meaning amateurs...<br> to stand up and tell me<br> just why a well-meaning amateur...<br> is any less reliable than a well-meaning<br> professional at a moment like this.<br> But I'll not take the time.<br> The world's been run long enough<br> by the well-meaning professional.<br> We might give the amateurs<br> a chance now.<br> But what I really want to do<br> is to give you a very brief idea of...<br> just how far-reaching<br> our amateur plans are.<br> Use your notes.<br> And just...<br> why we ask for your support...<br> professional or amateur.<br> What I mean to say is that,<br> however much one may...<br> I mean, we should both...<br> Both of us...<br> Tell them to wait in there.<br> - Mr. Fisher, how are you?<br> - When did you get over here?<br> Just now. I had a cable.<br> This conference is my first assignment.<br> An ironic assignment. A peace conference<br> under the shadow of war.<br> It's really coming?<br> Today and tomorrow will tell.<br> There's still hope.<br> I'm going back to London today.<br> Leaving for London? I just got here.<br> But the conference is just beginning.<br> Today and tomorrow the work for peace<br> is in London rather than Amsterdam.<br> You're taking your whole staff<br> back to London with you, including your...<br> No. I have someone staying here<br> who'll give you all the help you need.<br> You'll be in very good hands. Here she is.<br> Mrs. Appleby. Mr. Haverstock.<br> We met at the luncheon.<br> You remember him, don't you.<br> He's nice, but I still can't understand him.<br> Dr. Williamson, this is Huntley Haverstock<br> of the New York Globe.<br> He's unfamiliar with Amsterdam<br> and peace meetings.<br> Would you be good enough<br> to take him under your wing?<br> Perhaps you'll both see<br> that he samples Dutch cheese...<br> at dinner tonight.<br> Now I must see what unlucky person<br> will give up his seat on the London plane.<br> Don't get into any mischief, will you?<br> Mischief?<br> - Your first visit to Amsterdam?<br> - Yes.<br> You must let me take you<br> to Rembrandt's house...<br> It might be a good idea if we went over<br> the agenda of the conference with him.<br> If you'll excuse me. I think I see a friend.<br> Mr. Van Meer. How are you?<br> We somehow seemed to lose each other<br> day before yesterday.<br> I'm so sorry you were called away.<br> Don't you remember me?<br> We shared the same cab together<br> on the way to the luncheon.<br> Excuse me.<br> May I have your picture, Mr. Van Meer?<br> Thank you.<br> There he goes!<br> He's getting away!<br> Follow that car, quick!<br> You'd better get out of here.<br> Might be dangerous.<br> Don't be silly. Drive on.<br> - Who has he shot?<br> - Van Meer assassinated.<br> - Dead?<br> - Looked like it.<br> - Bad show.<br> - Couldrt be worse from his viewpoint.<br> Do you mind shoving your knees<br> out of the way.<br> - You better hop in the back, old girl.<br> - Hurry.<br> Safety glass. I wonder whose make.<br> - Good chauffeur you've got.<br> - Yes, isn't he?<br> You know each other?<br> This is Scott ffolliott, newspaperman,<br> same as you. Foreign correspondent.<br> - Mr. Haverstock, Mr. Ffolliott.<br> - With a double "F."<br> How do you do?<br> I don't get the double "F."<br> They're at the beginning. Both small "F's".<br> They can't be at the beginning.<br> One of my ancestors<br> was beheaded by Henry Vlll.<br> His wife dropped the capital letter<br> to commemorate it. There it is.<br> - How do you say it, like a stutter?<br> - Just a straight "fuh."<br> - It's stopped raining. Surs coming up.<br> - The police are coming.<br> It's the most amazing disappearing trick<br> I've ever seen.<br> You don't suppose they could've got up<br> that high, do you?<br> Vanished.<br> - Take a look for yourself.<br> - Tell him your name with the small "F"s.<br> That'll be a bit over his head.<br> This isn't catching any assassins.<br> We should have kept a policeman<br> and played bridge.<br> I guess you're right.<br> I'll bet 2-to-1 on the derby.<br> Look at those sails on that windmill.<br> You'll get used to those<br> when you've been in Holland longer.<br> I was sure they were going<br> against the wind.<br> Why don't you lie down on the grass<br> and cool off?<br> I'll cool off in due time.<br> But first get the police back here.<br> - The police again?<br> - We don't want them.<br> - I won't be prosecuting.<br> - No...<br> - Get the police, our mars there.<br> - Where?<br> - In that mill.<br> - What makes you think so?<br> A lot of things can happen<br> while I'm explaining. Please get the police.<br> I'd go myself if I spoke the language.<br> - What will you do?<br> - A little bit of snooping.<br> I hate to seem executive.<br> But this is serious.<br> - Come on, Scott.<br> - All right. You shall have your police.<br> It's a signal.<br> It's a signal for that plane to land.<br> Come in and close the door, mister.<br> Why, Mr. Van Meer. It isn't possible.<br> I've just been given a drug.<br> Drug of some sort.<br> But I saw you shot just outside<br> the conference hall. I saw it!<br> They gave it to me...<br> when they moved me from...<br> It's beginning now.<br> But the man I saw shot was a dead image.<br> The man you saw shot, it wasrt me.<br> He was a...<br> substitute that looked like me.<br> But why? What...<br> They want the world to think...<br> that I've been assassinated. Yes.<br> To conceal the fact...<br> - that I'm in their hands.<br> - Their hands? Who are they?<br> I can't explain.<br> I'm not certain.<br> This drug. I can hardly think.<br> All that I can tell you...<br> is that they are going<br> to take me away by plane...<br> like a bird.<br> Always there are places in the city...<br> where birds can get crumbs.<br> Birds.<br> Quick.<br> A pencil.<br> Give me the pen.<br> See? Old mill.<br> Up the road.<br> Look.<br> Man.<br> Old mill. Understand?<br> - Does anyone here speak English?<br> - We speak English in the school.<br> Why have you been holding out on me?<br> Look, tell these two policemen<br> to come with me.<br> Very, very important.<br> Big old prisoner. Old mill.<br> Tell them to follow me.<br> Do you understand?<br> Yeah. That's what<br> I've been trying to tell you. Come on.<br> They've gone.<br> They've killed him.<br> But it isn't...<br> Who are you?<br> Where are the others?<br> There's been a frame-up.<br> Ask him where the others have gone.<br> He doesn't know what you're<br> talking about. There are no other people.<br> And in any case,<br> he's been asleep here all day.<br> He's lying. I talked to Van Meer<br> in this very room.<br> There's one thing I can show you.<br> The assassins' car. The one we followed.<br> Rather a unique specimen, old boy.<br> The only one horsepower car in the world.<br> I don't care what you say.<br> That car was here.<br> Listen, I know I look a fool,<br> but there's something fishy going on.<br> There's a big story in this.<br> I can smell it, I can feel it.<br> I'll get to the bottom of it,<br> if it's the last thing I do.<br> Nothing's going to stop me.<br> Do you understand?<br> I'll prove that that wasrt Van Meer<br> that was assassinated, but his double.<br> Who is it?<br> All right. Come in.<br> - Mr. Haverstock?<br> - Yes.<br> What are you, the house detective?<br> You werert announced.<br> - I'm sorry, sir. We asked at the desk.<br> - Policemen?<br> You're not here<br> to apologize about the windmill?<br> We simply want you to come with us<br> and tell your story to our chief of police.<br> Does this chief of police speak English,<br> because I'm a very busy man.<br> It will take no more than half an hour.<br> We all speak English.<br> That's marvelous. That's more<br> than I can say for my country.<br> Would you sit down?<br> I have to make a phone call.<br> Dinner date with a young lady.<br> The exchange doesn't answer.<br> I'll call later.<br> Look, I'm a very quick bather.<br> Would you excuse me while I<br> jump in the tub and have a quick shave?<br> Look at some magazines. I'll be right back.<br> You can't you bring<br> the chief of police here?<br> - No, I am afraid not.<br> - I thought not.<br> Please don't bother to come.<br> You'll find it on my dressing table.<br> - We meet again.<br> - So it seems.<br> Quite a lot's happened<br> since I last saw you.<br> So I see.<br> I had quite a chase<br> after that guy outside Amsterdam.<br> It's quite a country.<br> It's interesting. Windmills and tulips.<br> Did you find everything you...<br> We were just talking about the tulips.<br> Don't seem to be any.<br> I really think I should be going now.<br> Thank you very much for the powder.<br> Must you really go now?<br> Yes, I must be going now. Really.<br> Goodbye.<br> You've made quite a day of it,<br> haven't you?<br> Making fools of Scott ffolliott and me,<br> breaking into my bedroom...<br> and disgracing me<br> before a friend of my father's.<br> What are your plans now?<br> You might at least have clothes on.<br> Take it easy. This is serious.<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> I've seen your serious business.<br> What're you doing here?<br> - I'm escaping.<br> - Escaping from what?<br> From some fellows<br> in my room about to kill me.<br> May I ask who?<br> Two gentlemen disguised as policemen,<br> waiting to take me for a ride.<br> - You're talking through your hat.<br> - I'm not talking through my hat.<br> I've thrown a monkey wrench<br> into some international dirty business.<br> I know Van Meer's alive.<br> That's why want to kill me.<br> I can think of others.<br> You've got to help me.<br> Not for my sake alone...<br> but it's the biggest story in Europe.<br> Your childish mind is out of place<br> in Europe as you are in my bedroom.<br> Get over there.<br> You see what you're doing?<br> All this is going back to London<br> and will be common gossip by tomorrow.<br> I don't care for myself,<br> but my father's engaged in great work.<br> He's trying to help avert a dreadful war...<br> and this is just the sort of thing<br> to discredit him.<br> I know you care nothing about our work.<br> All you're interested in is having fun<br> with windmills and bathrooms.<br> You don't believe I'm in trouble?<br> You'll be in lot of trouble<br> if you don't get out.<br> Now for the last time, please go.<br> Okay. But I want you to know exactly<br> what's going to happen when I do go.<br> I'll go back to my room<br> and try and shake those fellows off...<br> but I won't succeed.<br> They'll stick to me like a<br> couple of tattoo marks until they get me.<br> They'll stop at nothing. I seem to know<br> too much. And you're right.<br> I don't know much about<br> your crackpot peace movement...<br> I don't know what's wrong with Europe.<br> But I know a story when I see one.<br> I'll keep after it until either I get it<br> or it gets me.<br> Sorry you have those<br> derogatory opinions of me...<br> but I guess that can't be helped.<br> So long. It's been nice knowing you.<br> I said goodbye.<br> Don't go.<br> I guess I could have handled those fellows<br> with a little luck.<br> We mustrt take any chances.<br> We should get help.<br> That's what I had in mind.<br> - I'll get Dr. Williamson...<br> - Wait. They might not understand.<br> They have understood.<br> We could catch the night boat to England<br> if we could get out.<br> That's the hitch.<br> What's that friend's name, that "ff"?<br> - Ffolliott.<br> - Get me Mr. Ffolliott's room, please.<br> Left the hotel?<br> That's strange.<br> We were to dine together tonight.<br> - He realized how much I meant to you.<br> - You'd mean more with your clothes on.<br> You like the intellectual type.<br> - Say, I've got an idea.<br> - What?<br> Give me the manager, please.<br> Buzz for the valet.<br> Is this the manager?<br> This is Mr. Haverstock in 537.<br> What kind of hotel is this?<br> My bathtub leaks, phone's out of order,<br> and I've been robbed.<br> Will you send somebody up right away?<br> Thank you.<br> Operator, send a waiter up to 537.<br> And ask the chambermaid<br> to bring up some clean sheets.<br> I've set mine on fire.<br> And I'd like my windows cleaned.<br> And ask boots to come get my shoes.<br> Hurry up. That's a good girl.<br> Clutter up that room nicely<br> for those two guys.<br> It's the valet. Come in.<br> - Do you speak English?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Go to my room, 537...<br> and get me shirt, tie, suit, and a hat.<br> You see, my husband's<br> waiting in the room for this gentleman.<br> No sign of them yet.<br> Let's hide ourselves in the cabin.<br> - Full up, sir. Sorry.<br> - Not even a small cabin?<br> Not a thing.<br> Everybody in a hurry to get home.<br> I have a rather rare banknote<br> you might be interested in.<br> It's a memento,<br> that is if you collect rare banknotes.<br> It's no use, sir. I'd do it if I could,<br> but there just isn't a place left.<br> On English ships, you come up against<br> such an air of incorruptibility.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I've just had a cabin returned.<br> Can I have your name, sir?<br> One cabin isn't going to do us much good.<br> We just can't...<br> I fully intended to sleep in the lounge.<br> I hope you didn't think I...<br> No, of course not. It's very kind of you.<br> I'll take it.<br> I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid it's too late now.<br> You had some doubt about taking it,<br> so I had to let that gentleman have it.<br> That's too bad. It's such a rare 5 note.<br> The water mark's upside down.<br> I think you'd have loved it.<br> Well, perhaps next time.<br> - Were you really going to tip that man 5?<br> - Of course.<br> I charge all my traveling expenses<br> to the office.<br> Corrupting an official, 5.<br> You're just a wee bit unscrupulous,<br> aren't you?<br> Not unscrupulous. Just in love.<br> - It's the same thing, I suppose.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> I beg yours.<br> You see, I love you,<br> and I want to marry you.<br> I love you, and I want to marry you.<br> That cuts our love scene down<br> quite a bit, doesn't it?<br> - Do you mind?<br> - Not at all. It's made a new man of me.<br> I hope not entirely new.<br> It took me some time<br> to get used to the first man you were.<br> To be perfectly frank with you,<br> I expected a little more argument.<br> I'm really left with quite a few things<br> I very much wanted to say.<br> Save them until after we're married.<br> I imagine they'll sound better then.<br> I've saved things to say then, too.<br> You were really quite sure of yourself,<br> werert you?<br> I didn't think I had a chance.<br> A guy's got a right to dream, hasn't he?<br> Evidently.<br> Do you think your father will understand?<br> I think that Father<br> will be delighted, frankly.<br> All right, sir.<br> - Good morning, Miss Carol.<br> - Stiles, this is Mr. Haverstock.<br> - Is Father up yet?<br> - Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.<br> Come on.<br> - Hello, Father.<br> - What on earth are you doing in London?<br> Mr. Haverstock brought me back<br> on the boat.<br> - You're not ill? You look healthy.<br> - I'm fine. It's Mr. Haverstock.<br> I hope you don't mind my barging in.<br> On the contrary, I'm delighted to see you.<br> You cover a lot of territory, don't you?<br> You didn't even wire me.<br> For that I hope<br> your trip was uncomfortable.<br> It wasrt so bad.<br> The boat was crowded, we couldn't get<br> any cabins, but we slept on the deck.<br> Monsieur Krug, how nice to see you again.<br> But you haven't met<br> Mr. Haverstock, Monsieur Krug.<br> Monsieur Krug is a member<br> of the Baruvian embassy staff.<br> Sit down, Haverstock. Have breakfast.<br> I should tidy up, but I'm simply starved.<br> So you were in Amsterdam<br> yesterday, Mr. Haverstock.<br> Poor Van Meer.<br> His death is a personal loss.<br> Of all people, why Van Meer?<br> You can't ask why with assassins.<br> There's no logic in killing.<br> We can't spare such men<br> in a world like ours.<br> Did you by any chance<br> meet him, Mr. Haverstock?<br> - Not formally, but I saw him die.<br> - Horrible.<br> As a matter of fact, I chased the man<br> that shot him, and almost caught him.<br> Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman.<br> That'd be quite a coup...<br> bringing in your first story<br> wrapped around an assassin.<br> I think I shall have to be<br> getting along now, Mr. Fisher.<br> Shall we write the peace petition now<br> or leave it for later?<br> We may as well do it straightaway,<br> in the study. Excuse us.<br> Father, could I speak to you for a moment?<br> It's terribly important.<br> This won't take a moment.<br> Meanwhile, see if you can interest<br> Mr. Haverstock in some eggs and bacon.<br> Mr. Fisher. What's that man doing here?<br> Why, it's Monsieur Krug.<br> - Van Meer isn't dead.<br> - I just read...<br> That was his double that was shot.<br> Van Meer was kidnapped. I talked to him.<br> What has Monsieur Krug to do with it?<br> Remember my description<br> of the man in the mill?<br> You mean the sweater. Of course.<br> That's impossible.<br> We've known Monsieur Krug...<br> Krug brought Van Meer here last night.<br> He's in England. They're hiding him.<br> - You're positive?<br> - Of course.<br> I was as close to Krug as I am to you now.<br> It'd be terrible if we made a mistake.<br> But we can't allow him to...<br> Leave it to me.<br> I don't want to be inospitable,<br> but leave my house.<br> Mr. Haverstock will suggest<br> that I turn you over to the police.<br> Mr. Haverstock seems to be<br> something of a troublemaker.<br> You said he'd been taken care of<br> by our agents in Amsterdam.<br> I thought so, too. I don't understand it.<br> Unless, perhaps,<br> Miss Fisher's being with him...<br> may have caused complications.<br> It would've been ideal<br> if she'd been in our confidences.<br> - Please leave my daughter out of it.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> Most unfortunate, his coming here.<br> I've never had to cope with this<br> sort of thing before, thanks to you, Krug.<br> Someone has to take care<br> of the sordid details.<br> This is close to home.<br> In fact, it is my home.<br> After all, I'm only a politician. In a sense.<br> And politicians aren't usually<br> called upon to...<br> do away with their guests, are they?<br> Quiet, boy.<br> Not in the house. No, sir.<br> But I have an idea.<br> - Do you remember Rowley?<br> - Rowley?<br> Yes. The little man that used to work<br> at your father's stables in Austria.<br> I seem to recall he was present<br> when a mutual friend of ours...<br> accidentally fell off<br> the high bridge at Bern.<br> He's retired now.<br> Lives somewhere in Clapham,<br> here in London.<br> If Mr. Haverstock could be induced...<br> to hire him in the capacity<br> of a private detective.<br> What for?<br> You should warn him<br> that it's very dangerous for him...<br> to go about London<br> with the knowledge that he has.<br> Yes, I see.<br> You use the English language<br> with great delicacy.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I shall look Mr. Rowley up at once<br> and give him his instructions.<br> You mustrt. It would be too dangerous.<br> What do we do now, call Scotland Yard?<br> I thought it best to send<br> Monsieur Krug away.<br> You let him get away? Listen...<br> If what you say is true...<br> then it's important not to rouse<br> Krug's suspicions.<br> - Van Meer will be killed.<br> - Dead or alive, it's a story.<br> Johnny, father's right.<br> - Okay. I'll cable them what I've got.<br> - I wouldn't, if I were you.<br> Van Meer's life may depend on<br> our keeping this quiet a few hours.<br> Keep it quiet?<br> A famous diplomat's kidnapped right<br> under my eyes and I muzzle myself?<br> I'm sorry, but this is a story<br> with facts in it.<br> This is the kind of story I'm here to get,<br> the kind America's waiting for.<br> It'll be a bigger story if you can<br> wait a few hours...<br> until we find Van Meer and discover<br> what's behind this curious business.<br> I know what's behind it.<br> I don't mean who is behind it.<br> I mean the why of it.<br> Would you get me<br> all my correspondence with Krug?<br> Do what Father says.<br> It'll be best for you and Mr. Van Meer.<br> Okay. I'll wait.<br> I'm worried about you, Mr. Haverstock.<br> I'm worried about myself.<br> I feel weak-minded.<br> You're right. I don't like you dashing about<br> without some protection.<br> - Forget it.<br> - Lf you're right, you need protection.<br> I've covered beer mob killings<br> and race riots...<br> without even carrying a rabbit's foot.<br> These people are criminals...<br> more dangerous than your rumrunners<br> and house-breakers.<br> They're fanatics.<br> They combine a mad love of country<br> with an equally mad indifference to life...<br> their own, as well as others'.<br> They're cunning, unscrupulous<br> and inspired.<br> I couldn't face Mr. Powers again<br> if you didn't live long enough...<br> to turn in the best story of the year.<br> I'm gonna be a fine foreign correspondent<br> hiding in an attic.<br> I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere.<br> Just get somebody to protect you.<br> A nurse? Johnny Jones goes to Europe<br> and hires a nurse.<br> That's going to look great<br> on the expense account.<br> I know a very efficient detective agency<br> where we can get just the man.<br> - Okay. Whatever you say.<br> - I can arrange it for you.<br> If you'll feel better, I won't mention it<br> to anybody.<br> Mention it. If anyone finds out I've hired<br> a bodyguard, I'll shoot myself.<br> If that's Mr. Rowley,<br> tell him to wait outside.<br> I've called on Mr. Haverstock.<br> Will you tell him Mr. Rowley's here.<br> - Yes. Will you wait here, please?<br> - Thank you.<br> - Mr. Haverstock, your cab's here.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To the office, I've got work to do.<br> - You mustrt go.<br> I was sent over here at great expense<br> as a newspaperman, not a refugee.<br> - How about lunch at the Savoy?<br> - I'll see you out.<br> - Johnny, please be careful.<br> - I'll be all right.<br> - Mr. Haverstock?<br> - Is this the man?<br> Look, who's protecting who?<br> I ain't lanky, but I'm quick.<br> You understand what you have to do?<br> You can trust me to take good care<br> of Mr. Haverstock.<br> - Are we going now, sir?<br> - Take me to my office in Fleet Street...<br> - and if you're good, to the American Club.<br> - Right, sir.<br> You'll keep after this other thing?<br> When there's any definite news<br> of our friend, you can break the story.<br> Goodbye.<br> Why, Carol.<br> Nothing must happen to him, Father.<br> I just couldn't...<br> How do we go, sir?<br> Should I walk a little behind you,<br> or beside you, like a friend?<br> - What's the custom?<br> - People have different tastes.<br> When I served the Duke of Albertson,<br> a democratic sort of gent...<br> I used to walk alongside of him,<br> man-to-man like.<br> I once had a lady who thought<br> that was disrespectful.<br> "Three paces behind," she said.<br> "And don't smoke."<br> What's good for a duke is good enough<br> for me. We can be a team.<br> Thank you. If we want to go to<br> the American Club, we'd better take a cab.<br> There's one.<br> What's the trouble, sir?<br> Gangsters after you?<br> Not exactly.<br> We're not afraid of gangsters here.<br> Even our police don't carry guns.<br> - What do they do?<br> - Biff you over the head with a stick.<br> It's more healthy-like.<br> Did you see that?<br> Someone deliberately pushed me.<br> That was me. If I'd pulled you back,<br> you'd have been caught.<br> - It was push or nothing.<br> - That's smart work, Mr. Rowley.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> - That's what I'm here for.<br> Taxi!<br> - American Club.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> After you, sir.<br> I'm not certain, sir...<br> but I've got an idea two men<br> took another cab to follow us.<br> - I don't see anyone suspicious.<br> - I may have been mistaken...<br> but I'm almost certain I saw them.<br> They may have heard where we're going.<br> Driver.<br> Go down Victoria Street,<br> round past Buckingham Palace.<br> Right, sir.<br> We might give them the slip<br> if we go the long way around.<br> I'm afraid they're still after us.<br> Our best plan is to pull around<br> the corner and change cabs.<br> Driver, take the first to your left<br> and pull up.<br> We're going to walk a bit.<br> I'll do it, sir. I understand the money.<br> It'll be quicker.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I think our best plan<br> is to slip into the cathedral for a bit.<br> Let's stop this ducking out of sight.<br> Let them catch up and have a showdown.<br> No, I wouldn't cause a scene.<br> Our job is to give them the slip.<br> All right. Let's go.<br> Nice bit of architecture, sir.<br> Do you want to go right in?<br> I saw on the notice it was a requiem mass.<br> A mass for the dead.<br> That sort of thing always depresses me,<br> praying for the dead.<br> The dead are all right in their place...<br> but the music and candles<br> always give me the creeps.<br> Just really, sir.<br> I could be so frightened, sir, I...<br> How about a trip up top, sir?<br> That'd really put them off the scent.<br> Boys, careful there.<br> - I can't see.<br> - Here, here.<br> There you are, my boy!<br> Look. There it goes. There!<br> I'll have to buy you another now.<br> Love a duck!<br> Careful, boys.<br> You better be careful, too, sir.<br> Not yet, boys. Come.<br> Let's leave. I have a luncheon date<br> and plenty to do before.<br> I've got it in mind, don't you worry.<br> Really, now. Look.<br> Isn't it won'thwhile coming up here?<br> There's the Houses of Parliament there.<br> And there's St. James' Park.<br> That green patch. Yeah.<br> Come along, boys.<br> You must excuse me getting scared<br> when you leaned over just now, sir.<br> I was once with a man on a bridge<br> in Switzerland.<br> He had a very nasty fall.<br> Killed him. Stone dead.<br> Always made me a bit nervous since.<br> Don't go down just yet, sir.<br> I'd like you to see St. Paul's.<br> There it is, just coming out of the mist.<br> There's the horse guards approaching<br> Buckingham Palace. See them?<br> It makes the back of me legs go funny.<br> Heights always did.<br> Let's get down again, Eric.<br> We've just come up.<br> Why didn't you say so before?<br> Excuse me. I know just how you feel.<br> Them as has no head for heights.<br> Nobody ought not to blame them.<br> What's it got to do with you?<br> All right, keep your hair on.<br> I was only sympathizing with the lady.<br> - I'm going.<br> - Wait for the lift.<br> No.<br> No stairs for me.<br> I'm going to take the elevator.<br> Wait a minute, sir.<br> You ain't seen the horse guards yet.<br> You must see the horse guards, sir.<br> - Where? I don't see anything.<br> - Why, there they are, sir.<br> Down the road. Just going towards...<br> the white building.<br> No, boys. This way.<br> There but for the grace of God.<br> I still don't know what instinct made me<br> step aside when he came at me.<br> You need a drink.<br> I heard the lift coming up, and I turned.<br> I saw that look in his eyes<br> as he came toward me.<br> That split second, the whole thing<br> flashed through my mind.<br> All I could think of was Fisher.<br> Fisher planned this.<br> Then I guess I just stepped aside<br> and over he went.<br> - Over he went all right. You want this?<br> - No, thanks.<br> When are you going to send the story<br> to the gazette?<br> When I get ready.<br> There goes another one of my illusions.<br> I thought you were one of the journalists<br> nothing could stop.<br> Floods, smallpox, love:<br> The story must go on.<br> It'll go on.<br> No.<br> I can understand you not wanting<br> to drag Miss Fisher into it...<br> but she's probably in it already.<br> - The moll of the gang.<br> - You dirty...<br> On second thought,<br> I'm sure she's a fine girl...<br> upstanding, honest, and a great soul.<br> I can't send the story over<br> until Van Meer's safe.<br> We got to find Van Meer first.<br> There's our man now, probably.<br> Mr. Van Meer, come in.<br> Good morning, Stebbins.<br> How are you, Haverstock?<br> Congratulations on your little set-to<br> with Rowley.<br> What do you know about Rowley?<br> Very little ffolliott doesn't hear.<br> Probably knows about Fisher.<br> I was onto Fisher a year ago.<br> The fellow with the high neck sweater,<br> Krug, he's new to me.<br> - You're onto him, too?<br> - I followed him to London.<br> - I thought you were cold on this story.<br> - I've been doing some noticing.<br> Remember that tramp<br> you found asleep in the mill?<br> He wasrt a tramp at all.<br> - Van Meer, I suppose.<br> - Not quite.<br> But I notice him do<br> a strange thing for a tramp.<br> He dirtied his hands<br> with some of that nasty Dutch soil.<br> I can't follow the workings<br> of these masterminds.<br> No. Tell him it's ridiculous.<br> You'd already disappeared,<br> so I followed Krug...<br> but found the same old mousetrap.<br> - You mean Fisher?<br> - The good, kind...<br> genial head of the Peace Party,<br> Herr Fisher.<br> Hello, Eddy. This is Plunger Stebbins.<br> I want to place a bet on<br> Flibbertigibbet in the first race...<br> What? The race is over?<br> Okay, I'll call you later.<br> Any objection to our working<br> this thing together?<br> Catch Fisher, find Van Meer?<br> Fine, but I'd like to know<br> why they kidnapped Van Meer.<br> He was one of the signatories<br> to a certain treaty.<br> The most important clause<br> was never written down...<br> just memorized by the two signatories.<br> And they'll beat it out of him?<br> They'll try hard, and we should stop them.<br> It contains a piece of information<br> very valuable to the enemy...<br> in the war that starts tomorrow,<br> weather permitting.<br> What? Why didn't somebody<br> let me in on this? Stebbins, let's get busy.<br> Plenty of time. Lunch first.<br> Wait a minute. You might be of help.<br> I thought up a little plan<br> for forcing Fisher's hand.<br> Let's have it.<br> The neatest thing to do<br> would be to kidnap Fisher's daughter.<br> Yeah?<br> One of his few genuine traces of affection<br> is for Miss Fisher.<br> Easy. You're speaking to a man in love.<br> Good. Gives you a chance to get chummy,<br> to keep her happy at your side...<br> while we batter old Papa.<br> This is my little scheme.<br> I let Fisher know that his daughter is<br> in the hands of someone...<br> who means business just as he does<br> when he kidnaps people...<br> - and he'll see things our way.<br> - Nothing doing.<br> Arert you a newspaperman?<br> - That doesn't include kidnapping fiances.<br> - It would, if your country were at stake.<br> - This isn't my country.<br> - It's your story. Don't be gloomy.<br> She doesn't have to know<br> what you're doing. Keep her amused.<br> Why not grab Fisher, have a showdown?<br> That's no good.<br> We've got nothing on Fisher.<br> He'd slip out of it. He has been for years.<br> We'd merely kill Van Meer.<br> Darling, are you all right?<br> Why were you on the tower?<br> Keeping safe, I thought.<br> Those assassins followed,<br> there was a scuffle, and over he went.<br> They won't stop till they get you.<br> You must leave London immediately.<br> The one thing everybody forgets<br> is that I'm a reporter.<br> - And there's a war. I can't run from it.<br> - He can't stay here.<br> - Tell him how desperate they are.<br> - Don't stay here, why don't you take him?<br> I won't go.<br> Isn't there some maiden aunt<br> in the country?<br> - My Aunt Margaret. Let me take you there.<br> - How about it?<br> - Stay out of this.<br> - It's the only sensible thing to do.<br> May I use your telephone?<br> Hello, Stiles. Miss Carol speaking.<br> Please tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving<br> to my Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.<br> - I don't care what you arrange. I won't go.<br> - I'll be back for dinner. Thank you.<br> - It's all settled. We'll get you a toothbrush.<br> - Carol, it's no good.<br> I wonder if this idea of your aunt<br> is so good.<br> Maybe you should go further,<br> say, Cambridge.<br> No place is as obscure as Harpenden.<br> It's not the place, but that Krug<br> might connect you with it.<br> - Maybe so. Let's make it Cambridge.<br> - I'll phone your father so he doesn't worry.<br> Thank you. Please, Johnny.<br> That was a break, her coming,<br> and suggesting they go to the country.<br> As a matter of fact, old boy...<br> I suggested it to her on the phone<br> about half an hour ago.<br> There hasn't been a sign of anybody<br> for the last 30 miles.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - Nothing.<br> At least talk to me.<br> It's unfair of you to sit and pout...<br> because I've kidnapped you<br> from your so-called duties.<br> You've kidnapped me?<br> Just remember that.<br> Please forgive me.<br> Sure. I don't think kidnapping's anything<br> to get sore about...<br> - when the right kidnapper does it. Do you?<br> - Not at all.<br> Thanks.<br> Hello?<br> No, Mr. Ffolliott, I'm afraid he's not in yet.<br> Very well, sir.<br> - Johnny, you don't love me.<br> - You're crazy.<br> - You looked unappy kissing me.<br> - Never happier in my life.<br> Wort do. Johnny, what's happened?<br> I don't know.<br> They say war's coming tomorrow.<br> You've changed your philosophy<br> since yesterday.<br> There are more important things<br> than love.<br> I've got lots to do, important things.<br> Got to start.<br> It'll take three hours to get back.<br> Don't misunderstand me.<br> I'm so love with you, I'm going mad.<br> Wort do. I guess it can't be helped.<br> - You've turned European overnight.<br> - That's unfair.<br> I'm just as big a jackass as ever. Bigger.<br> You're not going back to London to dinner.<br> You can't run out on your kidnapper.<br> I mean, you know what I mean.<br> If you leave, I'll go back to London<br> and let them bump me off.<br> - It'll be a relief at that.<br> - You are moody.<br> Am I the cause of it?<br> If you knew how much I loved you,<br> you'd faint.<br> There. What'd I tell you?<br> Come in.<br> - Mr. Haverstock?<br> - Yes?<br> Call from London.<br> - Have them switch it here.<br> - The only phone here is in the office.<br> All right. I'll come down.<br> Forgive me for a moment, dear.<br> Just a moment, sir.<br> - Hello?<br> - Is that you, Haverstock?<br> Are you alone? Can you talk?<br> I can't reach Fisher.<br> He's been out all afternoon.<br> You'll have to keep the girl there<br> much longer than we planned.<br> I don't know when he'll return.<br> I've got to catch him alone.<br> Better keep her there<br> for the rest of the night.<br> That's absolutely impossible.<br> We can't let this thing go now.<br> I can't very well explain,<br> but I couldn't pull a thing like that.<br> There's nothing else to be done.<br> I'm counting on you.<br> Hello?<br> Are you quite satisfied<br> with your room, sir?<br> Not exactly. I mean, yes...<br> But what I really wanted<br> was another room as well.<br> A single room.<br> Mr. Naysmith, this gentleman wants<br> another room.<br> Is it for the lady<br> and how long do you need it?<br> She'll only be here just the one night.<br> - The gentleman has Number 7.<br> - What about Number 8?<br> It doesn't really make any difference.<br> Just a good room, windows and all that.<br> I understand.<br> Perhaps the room next to yours<br> would be best.<br> It's quite a cozy room, isn't it, Number 8?<br> - They're all alike to me, sir.<br> - Eight will do.<br> Will you bring the lady down<br> to sign the book, please?<br> Yes, I'll get her.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Good evening.<br> Terrible thing, sir, that poor man<br> who was here this morning.<br> - Yes, terrible. My bags all packed?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What about Miss Carol's?<br> Mrs. Stiles packed hers, too. She hopes<br> she's put in the right things.<br> It's been a rush, as she's not back yet.<br> Mr. Ffolliott's waiting in the sitting room.<br> Another gentleman phoned,<br> but wouldn't leave his name.<br> I thought he sounded<br> like the foreign gentleman at breakfast.<br> - Did he say he'd telephone again?<br> - Yes. He said it was urgent.<br> Well, show Mr. Ffolliott into the study.<br> - Hello, sir.<br> - You caught me at a very busy moment.<br> I'm going to America tomorrow.<br> Are you taking Carol with you?<br> Yes, she doesn't know yet.<br> It's been a rush. I'm waiting for her.<br> Scott, what's your worry?<br> Must be important.<br> Yes, it is rather important.<br> It's about Carol.<br> - I'm afraid that...<br> - What? Anything happen to her?<br> No, but I don't think you'll be able to<br> take her with you to America.<br> Why not?<br> I know it'll sound rather silly to you,<br> but Carol's been kidnapped.<br> - Is this a joke of some sort?<br> - No, sir.<br> What do you mean, kidnapped?<br> I happen to know she's with her aunt<br> in Harpenden.<br> I'm afraid she isn't.<br> Who gave you the message that<br> Miss Carol's gone to her Aunt Margaret's?<br> Miss Carol herself, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> That's where she thought she was going.<br> Get me Harpenden, 43422.<br> Hello. Is that you, Margaret?<br> Is Carol with you?<br> No. I wasrt certain.<br> She said she might run down to see you.<br> I didn't know whether to expect<br> her back for dinner.<br> All right. Good night, Margaret.<br> No, she isn't there.<br> What makes you say<br> she's been kidnapped?<br> Sir, I arranged it.<br> Ffolliott, this has gone far enough.<br> Where is Carol?<br> Carol's being held as a sort of hostage...<br> by some people<br> who are very much in earnest...<br> as much in earnest as you are.<br> Don't be so cryptic.<br> I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.<br> I want to know<br> where you're hiding Van Meer.<br> So that's it. You've been talking<br> with that American, Haverstock.<br> He told me something about Van Meer<br> being alive.<br> You promised Haverstock<br> you'd look into it.<br> Naturally.<br> Unusual way of looking into it,<br> trying to put him out of the way.<br> I realize a life's a small matter,<br> the way you work.<br> The people who've got Carol<br> can take a leaf out of your book.<br> Where is she? What've you done with her?<br> Where's Van Meer?<br> Hello.<br> I can get our Dutch friend to talk<br> if you come along yourself.<br> Sorry to drag you here, but it's the only<br> way if you want to leave tomorrow.<br> When you get here,<br> ask at the cashier's desk to use the phone.<br> They'll show you straight up.<br> I'll drop in as soon as I can.<br> If you want Carol to go with you,<br> better tell me where Van Meer is.<br> Bring her here, I'll give you the address.<br> Carol can be home in three hours.<br> I want that address now.<br> You can have it as soon as Carol's home.<br> I can't possibly wait three hours.<br> Besides, I happen to want Van Meer alive.<br> - Scott, I delivered him all right.<br> - Good.<br> I think I'll be getting along.<br> Thanks very much for those points.<br> Can I take them now?<br> Good night, Carol.<br> This isn't like you.<br> What is it that upsets you so?<br> I know I'm being silly.<br> I'm behaving perfectly stupidly.<br> Please forgive me.<br> I wouldn't mind so much...<br> but I didn't think<br> he was that sort of person.<br> Something to do with young Haverstock?<br> You like him very much.<br> After what happened,<br> I drove him to the country...<br> to get him away from those people.<br> I thought you were going<br> to Aunt Margaret's.<br> We were, but Scott ffolliott...<br> thought it would be better<br> to go further away.<br> So I thought The College Arms<br> at Cambridge would be a good place.<br> When we got there,<br> I found out that he wanted...<br> You see, we'd been joking about it.<br> When I heard him book the extra room,<br> I knew he meant it.<br> Cheap trick. That's what hurts.<br> It was so cheap.<br> It wasrt at all like I thought it was.<br> What difference does it make,<br> I don't care if I ever see him again.<br> You won't have to. We're going<br> to America tomorrow by clipper.<br> Tomorrow? But I can't.<br> I suppose I can, but why tomorrow?<br> They'll probably declare war tomorrow.<br> We have to get to Washington.<br> The boats will be crowded.<br> We may have to wait two weeks<br> for passage.<br> - But what about Mr. Van Meer?<br> - We've done all we could.<br> I was at the foreign office.<br> They're taking the whole thing over.<br> - What is it?<br> - The blackout. I have to draw the blinds.<br> I forgot. Before you do that,<br> order me a taxi.<br> Yes, sir.<br> There are some people I must see<br> before we leave.<br> I shouldn't be long.<br> Mrs. Stiles has done your packing.<br> We'll drive to Southampton,<br> stay overnight at the Southwestern.<br> Stiles, my hat.<br> Goodbye, darling.<br> I'll return as soon as possible.<br> Meanwhile, you and Stiles load the car<br> and get something to eat.<br> - But what about you?<br> - I'll get a sandwich later.<br> at the top of Tottenam Court Road.<br> Wait here until Haverstock turns up.<br> He's bound to come here.<br> When he does, bring him to<br> off of Tottenam Court Road.<br> Be careful.<br> Might I use your telephone?<br> This way, sir.<br> - Where is he?<br> - In there.<br> We can't make him say anything.<br> It's up to you.<br> Let's go. Is this place safe?<br> There'll be no interruptions.<br> We close it for decorations.<br> - The people downstairs?<br> - They won't make trouble.<br> They know what will happen<br> to their relatives if they do.<br> It's an attractive nest, I know,<br> and the music...<br> - It serves its purpose.<br> - Yes.<br> Pardon me.<br> Put your arm around him.<br> Hold his head forward.<br> These lights, can't you cut them down?<br> I thank you.<br> I thank you very much.<br> You're like my friend Mr. Fisher.<br> I'm sorry. It's just so dark...<br> I can't tell...<br> but you are so like my friend.<br> I am Fisher, Mr. Van Meer.<br> I am your friend.<br> I'm so glad.<br> Are the police here?<br> They mustrt get away.<br> You mustrt let these people go.<br> I represent Jupiter Life Insurance.<br> Would you like a small policy?<br> - Why did you bring him up here?<br> - I didn't know what to do.<br> I'd gladly relieve the lady<br> of this embarrassment.<br> You know how women are with firearms,<br> no sense of timing.<br> I'll just sit here. You carry on with<br> what you were doing.<br> Don't mind me.<br> I sometimes sit like this for hours.<br> Who's that?<br> Is it the police?<br> Tell me where I am.<br> You are in London, Mr. Van Meer.<br> In London?<br> Have I been here long?<br> You must send a telegram to my wife.<br> Tell her that I am safe with you.<br> Please try to understand, Mr. Van Meer.<br> The police are not here.<br> I am here merely to talk to you.<br> But these people...<br> They think I'm working with them.<br> They don't know that I'm your friend.<br> We must play a little game.<br> A little game?<br> Yes. They've asked me<br> to get you to tell me...<br> what they're trying to find out.<br> But I can't do that.<br> You know that I can't.<br> You can tell me.<br> Just that one clause in the treaty.<br> Clause 27.<br> Clause 27. Come, Mr. Van Meer.<br> That's the secret clause.<br> I know it, Clause 27.<br> But they, they mustrt know it.<br> It would help them if they make war.<br> War, Fisher.<br> - You don't want them helped, do you?<br> - Of course not.<br> Just let them see you telling it to me.<br> That'll be enough.<br> Let them see you whisper it to me.<br> I'll promise to keep it safe.<br> He's not your friend, Mr. Van Meer.<br> Don't tell him.<br> Who's that?<br> Someone just said you werert my friend.<br> Why didn't you bring the police?<br> Why aren't you taking me away from here?<br> You are not to take me away.<br> Why?<br> Where are you?<br> Help me.<br> That's it.<br> I see now.<br> There's no help. No help...<br> for the whole poor suffering world.<br> You cry peace, Fisher.<br> Peace. And there was no peace.<br> Only war and death.<br> You're a liar, Fisher.<br> A cruel liar.<br> You can do what you want with me.<br> That's not important.<br> But you'll never conquer them, Fisher.<br> Little people everywhere...<br> who give crumbs to birds.<br> Lie to them.<br> Drive them, whip them...<br> force them into war.<br> When the beasts like you...<br> will devour each other...<br> then the world...<br> will belong to the little people.<br> We're wasting valuable time.<br> All right. I will tell you...<br> I will tell everything.<br> Come on, Mr. Fisher.<br> In the event of invasion by an enemy...<br> Why, it's only a restaurant.<br> Look! Come on!<br> This way. Down the back stairs.<br> Follow me.<br> They must've gone the other way.<br> Look after him.<br> You're a blithering idiot<br> if you don't nab Fisher...<br> before he boards that plane.<br> How can we arrest him<br> without any evidence?<br> You're obstinate.<br> Isn't Van Meer proof enough?<br> No, and you ought to know it.<br> What proof is there against<br> Fisher personally?<br> Of all the conceited, stupid numbskull...<br> Stop behaving like a boy scout<br> and let us handle this.<br> Ask McKenna to come in.<br> Go see Dr. Boniface.<br> He's very good for nerves.<br> - Identification of Van Meer complete?<br> - Yes.<br> He's unconscious, but there's no doubt<br> it's Van Meer.<br> You'd better get back.<br> Take somebody along to get a statement<br> when he comes to.<br> Meanwhile, keep an eye<br> on that flying boat...<br> await instructions from us.<br> What's the good of being related<br> to Scotland Yard?<br> - My fool brother won't do anything.<br> - Scotland Yard can't solve my problems.<br> - Everyone's in on it but me.<br> - You're in it, too.<br> We've got to watch that plane.<br> While we're driving...<br> - ring Mayfair 24574.<br> - Let me write that.<br> Mayfair 24574. That's my cousin.<br> He's the director of the airline.<br> Tell him we need two seats<br> on tomorrow's clipper to America.<br> Then go to Hilton Nursing Home<br> and stick by Van Meer.<br> Then phone Miss Edith Armbruster,<br> Kensington 66255.<br> Tell her I'm off to America.<br> Will she dine with me next Monday<br> instead of tomorrow?<br> - Sure.<br> - Then call up Stevens at the Post.<br> Tell him I'm off to America.<br> Cable New York,<br> tell them I'm off to America.<br> Ring up the Crescent Dancing Academy<br> and cancel my rumba lesson.<br> Two ham sandwiches on rye bread.<br> - There's no use in my waiting around.<br> - It's hard to say how soon he'll recover.<br> It may be some hours before he can speak.<br> I don't know much about this,<br> but my friend's on the clipper.<br> If Van Meer speaks,<br> they'll send word to the plane.<br> Did you hear the wireless?<br> War is declared! Read all about it.<br> War declared! It's war with Germany!<br> I found that picture.<br> - Steward, bring me one of those, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Any message for me?<br> - What name?<br> - Is there a message for me?<br> - I'll be with you in a minute.<br> - This one's for me.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Lovely, isn't it?<br> Sort of makes you forget<br> all about the war and troubles.<br> It would be nice if we could keep flying,<br> live in the clouds.<br> Yes, it would be very nice.<br> It's time for me to make a landing,<br> a forced landing.<br> What's the matter? Anything happen?<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> I don't want to, but I've got to.<br> The hardest part is talking to you now.<br> I don't mind about the rest.<br> - It's about Krug and Van Meer.<br> - You've guessed.<br> Not till last night. I've been worried...<br> but I believed in you.<br> You shouldn't.<br> It's true, then, what I wouldn't believe?<br> Yes. I'm to be arrested when we land...<br> as a spy, shipped back to London.<br> It's quite all right, except,<br> just the one phase of it. You.<br> That's why I've got to talk to you.<br> I should like for you to see a little<br> from my point of view...<br> it might help you afterwards.<br> First about yourself, my deceiving you.<br> I didn't want you involved in any part<br> because you're English...<br> half-English anyway. I'm not.<br> I'm just coated with an English accent.<br> A thin coat.<br> I fought for my country in my heart<br> in a very difficult way.<br> Sometimes it's harder to fight<br> dishonorably than nobly in the open.<br> I used my country's methods<br> because I was born with them.<br> I don't intend on making this plea<br> to the court-martial.<br> I'm making it only to my daughter<br> whom I loved dearly...<br> and before whom I feel a little ashamed.<br> What you say to me now<br> means more to me than any verdict.<br> My dear...<br> Steward, this is not for me.<br> It was a mistake.<br> I'm not sitting 14 hours<br> playing hide-and-seek with her.<br> I'm going to talk to her.<br> It can't do any harm,<br> now that he knows we're aboard.<br> - Not a word in front of her, understand?<br> - I wouldn't dream of talking.<br> - What will you say to her?<br> - I don't know. I'm all mixed up.<br> I love her, and I'm going to help<br> hang her father.<br> I've got to say something. I'll go crazy.<br> Have some brandy. You'll feel better.<br> You know it always makes me cry harder.<br> - Surprised?<br> - What are you doing here?<br> Having myself a ride.<br> Carol, I've got to speak to you alone.<br> It's very important.<br> - Do you mind, Mr. Fisher?<br> - Ffolliott's with you, isn't he?<br> In a way, yes.<br> You're both after my father.<br> You're having him arrested<br> when we land, aren't you?<br> I don't know what you mean.<br> I never arrested anyone in my life.<br> That's a lie. You've followed him<br> from the beginning.<br> That's why you wanted me<br> out of the way at the inn...<br> pretended you loved me so you could...<br> It's a lie, that's all.<br> Everything you've said to me<br> have been lies.<br> - Quite a reunion, isn't it?<br> - You, too?<br> Please. Have a drink, Scott. I'll be back.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To stretch my legs.<br> I read that wire you received.<br> It was given to me by mistake.<br> That's all right, sir.<br> You're not going unless I go with you.<br> I know you both think<br> my father is a traitor and a renegade.<br> He isn't. Not to me.<br> Thank you.<br> A minority report, but very welcome.<br> Carol, I've got nothing to do with spies.<br> I'm just a reporter here after a story.<br> I'm sorry I ever heard of Van Meer.<br> I'd blow up the Globe, cut Powers' throat<br> rather than harm you.<br> What is it?<br> They've gone crazy. What are they doing?<br> Who are they? What is it?<br> Call Bob. Tell him we're being attacked.<br> Sorry about this, ffolliott.<br> It has nothing to do with me.<br> We're coming down.<br> You're the most cool-headed woman<br> I've ever seen.<br> Make Father wear this.<br> Here you are. Put these on.<br> Come out, sir.<br> They're all going nuts in there.<br> I'll be out immediately.<br> What am I going to say?<br> This isn't like bad weather.<br> Tell them it's a mistake,<br> that it's target practice.<br> I know it's funny for me to ask you<br> to be calm.<br> We're doing the best we can.<br> Get back.<br> Are we all going to drown?<br> Keep away from that window, sir.<br> It might be dangerous. Sit back.<br> I'm not going to put this on.<br> I've never heard of anything so stupid.<br> I'll see the British Consul as soon as l...<br> She's gone.<br> What in the name of heaven<br> are they doing?<br> Switch off the gas.<br> You've got the other board motor.<br> - They cut off the other starboard motor.<br> - Right.<br> It's the Germans. They're sorry.<br> They thought we were a bomber.<br> She'll rescue us straight-away.<br> The wings are off.<br> - Let me get out!<br> - Come away from that door.<br> We can't just stay here.<br> When she hits the water,<br> the tail's the best place.<br> Come on.<br> No good staying on here,<br> she's going under. Quick, onto the wing.<br> Look, there's the pilot.<br> - Don't let him on, you fools!<br> - Shut your mouth!<br> I'm throwing that swine off.<br> He's right. It won't hold us.<br> I'd better slip away.<br> I'll move to the other end.<br> That might make it lighter here.<br> He's gone!<br> Johnny, don't go! You'll be washed away!<br> Johnny, come back!<br> Look!<br> Must be the enemy coming to pick us up.<br> Is it the enemy?<br> We're all right. She's American.<br> American ship picked us up<br> and is taking us back to London.<br> I can't tell you what happened.<br> I'll wire from London in a few days. Bye.<br> It's awkward, I just spoke to the captain.<br> He insists on acting the true blue neutral.<br> "Enemy waters," he says. Not a line<br> to the press from his ship.<br> Can't send out any stories?<br> We can use the phone<br> for private messages.<br> "Hello, Aunt Effie,<br> safe aboard the Mohican.<br> "Feeling tiptop."<br> Two days before we get to London,<br> we get scooped on our own story.<br> - You have a crack at brass buttons.<br> - Even if he says okay...<br> what good will it do me?<br> My hands are tied.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Carol.<br> I came 4,000 miles to get a story.<br> I get shot at...<br> I got pushed off buildings.<br> I get the story, then I got to shut up.<br> I'm sincere. I'm not throwing her father<br> up for grabs.<br> He died like a hero to save her<br> and the rest of us.<br> I'm talking through my hat.<br> The whole point is, he was her father.<br> I won't play Judas to the only girl...<br> I'm very glad you said that.<br> - You all dry and everything?<br> - I'm all right.<br> Send the whole story.<br> - We'll talk about that later.<br> - Please.<br> You can't help me by protecting my father.<br> I'm in love with you.<br> I can't hit you with a scandal<br> for a wedding present.<br> My father fought for his country his way.<br> It wasrt a straight way,<br> but it was a hard way.<br> And I've got to fight for my country<br> a hard way.<br> Okay, if that's the way you feel.<br> That's for me.<br> I put in a call to my uncle, Uncle Powers.<br> Hello?<br> Johnny Jones is calling from the Mohican.<br> What's he doing there?<br> Johnny wouldn't call if it wasrt a story.<br> Hold the presses. Send Bradley in here.<br> Tell him we're breaking up Page 1.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello, Mr. Powers. This is Johnny Jones.<br> Here comes the captain.<br> Mr. Powers, keep your ear glued<br> to this phone and don't hang up.<br> - Mr. Haverstock, I want to talk with you.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - I just found out you're a newspaperman.<br> - That's right.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> when I questioned you?<br> - You lied to me.<br> - My dear Captain...<br> when you're shot down<br> in a British plane by a German destroyer...<br> Latitude 45...<br> have been hanging<br> on a half-submerged wing for hours...<br> waiting to drown<br> with other stricken human beings...<br> you're liable to forget<br> you're a newspaperman.<br> You'll have to forget it<br> for as long as you're on this ship.<br> I can't understand your attitude, sir.<br> You performed a heroic rescue,<br> Captain John Martin.<br> - You took us out of the sea.<br> - You're not sending a thing from this ship.<br> You're right, Captain.<br> We mustrt embarrass<br> the United States government.<br> Exactly. That's my point.<br> That's the story I've got. I won't print it.<br> I think you ought to hear it first.<br> That's only fair, Captain.<br> You know who headed that movement<br> in London?<br> Mr. Stephen Fisher.<br> The man who ran<br> the Universal Peace Party?<br> - Why, that's preposterous.<br> - Yes.<br> The Mr. Fisher who was drowned<br> a few hours ago.<br> His peace party was a cover-up<br> for spies and traitors.<br> He was going to be arrested and deported.<br> - Those are facts.<br> - I can't believe it. He was a friend of mine.<br> He engineered the kidnapping<br> of Van Meer, the Dutch diplomat.<br> - Nobody would believe that.<br> - It's the truth.<br> - I refuse...<br> - Dear Captain, wait a minute.<br> This young lady should know<br> whether it's the truth or not.<br> Yes, I ought to know.<br> Mr. Fisher was my father.<br> And I want the story printed.<br> - What's that?<br> - I guess that's my uncle.<br> Hello, Uncle. How are you?<br> How's Aunt Sadie? I'm all right, thanks.<br> We had a little accident.<br> I can't tell you about it now.<br> I'll write to you.<br> I'm going back to Europe.<br> I was just wondering<br> if you had any instructions for me.<br> Yes. Keep on the job.<br> Have you got all that down?<br> Rush it out at once.<br> This is London.<br> We have as a guest tonight<br> a soldier of the press...<br> one of the army of historians...<br> writing history from beside<br> the cannors mouth...<br> Foreign correspondent<br> of the New York Globe...<br> Huntley Haverstock.<br> Hello, America.<br> I've been watching a part of the world<br> being blown to pieces.<br> A part of the world<br> as nice as Vermont, Ohio...<br> Virginia, and California, and Illinois...<br> lies ripped up and bleeding<br> like a steer in a slaughterhouse.<br> I've seen things that make the history of<br> savages read like Pollyanna legends.<br> - We'll have to postpone the broadcast.<br> - Let's go on as long as we can.<br> Madam, we have a shelter downstairs.<br> - How about it, Carol?<br> - They're listening in America, Johnny.<br> Okay. We'll tell them, then.<br> I can't read the rest of my speech<br> because the lights went out...<br> so I'll have to talk off the cuff.<br> That noise you hear isn't static.<br> It's death coming to London.<br> You can hear the bombs<br> falling on the streets and the homes.<br> Don't tune me out. Hang on.<br> This is a big story. You're part of it.<br> It's too late to do anything here<br> except stand in the dark, let them come.<br> It's as if the lights were out everywhere<br> except in America.<br> Keep those lights burning.<br> Cover them with steel,<br> ring them with guns...<br> build a canopy of battleships<br> and bombing planes around them.<br> Hello, America, hang onto your lights.<br> They're the only lights left in the world.<br> English<br>
