                        Hello.<br> My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.<br> Do you want a chocolate?<br> I could eat<br> about a million and a half of these.<br> My mama always said<br> life was like a box of chocolates.<br> You never know<br> what you're going to get.<br> Those must be comfortable shoes.<br> I bet you could walk all day in shoes<br> like that and not feel a thing.<br> - I wish I had shoes like that.<br> - My feet hurt.<br> Mama always said there's an awful lot<br> you can tell about a person<br> by their shoes.<br> Where they're going,<br> where they've been.<br> I've worn lots of shoes.<br> I bet if I think about it real hard,<br> I could remember<br> my first pair of shoes.<br> Mama said they'd take me anywhere.<br> She said they was my magic shoes.<br> All right, Forrest,<br> open your eyes now.<br> Let's take a little walk around.<br> How do those feel?<br> His legs are strong, Mrs Gump,<br> as strong as I've ever seen.<br> But his back's as<br> crooked as a politician.<br> But we're going to straighten him<br> right up, aren't we, Forrest?<br> When I was a baby, Mama named me<br> after the great Civil War hero<br> General Nathan Bedford Forrest.<br> She said we was related to him<br> in some way.<br> What he did was he started up<br> this club called the Ku Klux Klan.<br> They'd all dress up<br> in their robes and their bed sheets<br> and act like a bunch<br> of ghosts or spooks or something.<br> They'd even put bed sheets<br> on their horses and ride around.<br> And anyway, that's how<br> I got my name, Forrest Gump.<br> Mama said the Forrest part<br> was to remind me that sometimes<br> we all do things that, well,<br> just don't make no sense.<br> This way. Hold on.<br> All right.<br> What are y'all staring at?<br> Haven't you ever seen a little boy<br> with braces on his legs before?<br> Don't ever let anybody tell you<br> they're better than you, Forrest.<br> If God wanted everybody<br> to be the same,<br> he'd have given us all<br> braces on our legs.<br> Mama always had a way of explaining<br> things so I could understand them.<br> We lived about<br> a quarter mile off Route 17,<br> about a half mile<br> from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.<br> That's in the county of Greenbow.<br> Our house had been in Mama's family<br> since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa<br> had come across the ocean<br> about a thousand years ago.<br> Since it was just me and Mama<br> and we had all these empty rooms,<br> Mama decided to let those rooms out,<br> mostly to people passing through,<br> Iike from Mobile,<br> Montgomery, places like that.<br> That's how me and Mama got money.<br> Mama was a real smart lady.<br> Remember what I told you, Forrest.<br> You're no different<br> than anybody else is.<br> Did you hear what I said, Forrest?<br> You're the same as everybody else.<br> You are no different.<br> Your boy's different, Mrs Gump.<br> His l.Q. Is 75.<br> Well, we're all different,<br> Mr Hancock.<br> She wanted me to have<br> the finest education,<br> so she took me to<br> the Greenbow County Central School.<br> I met the principal and all.<br> I want to show you<br> something, Mrs Gump.<br> Now, this is normal.<br> Forrest is right here.<br> The state requires a minimum l.Q.<br> of 80 to attend public school.<br> Mrs Gump, he's going to have<br> to go to a special school.<br> - He'll be just fine.<br> - What does normal mean anyway?<br> He might be a bit on the slow side,<br> but my boy Forrest<br> will get the same opportunities<br> as everyone else.<br> He's not going to some special school<br> to learn how to retread tyres.<br> We're talking about<br> five little points here.<br> There must be something can be done.<br> We're a progressive school system.<br> We don't want to see<br> anybody left behind.<br> Is there a Mr Gump, Mrs Gump?<br> He's on vacation.<br> Your mama sure does care<br> about your schooling, son.<br> You don't say much, do you?<br> "Finally, he had to try.<br> It looked easy, but...<br> "Oh, what happened. First they..."<br> - Mama, what's vacation mean?<br> - Vacation?<br> Where daddy went?<br> Vacation's when you go somewhere...<br> and you don't ever come back.<br> Anyway, I guess you could say<br> me and Mama was on our own.<br> But we didn't mind.<br> Our house was never empty.<br> There was always<br> folks coming and going.<br> - Supper! It's supper, everyone!<br> - That sure looks special.<br> Sometimes, we had so many people<br> staying with us<br> that every room was filled,<br> with travellers, you know,<br> folks living out of their suitcases<br> and hat cases and sample cases.<br> Forrest Gump,<br> it's suppertime! Forrest?<br> One time, a young man was staying<br> with us, and he had a guitar case.<br> Forrest, I told you not to bother<br> this nice young man.<br> No, that's all right, ma'am.<br> I was showing him<br> a thing or two on the guitar.<br> All right. Supper's ready<br> if y'all want to eat.<br> Yeah, that sounds good.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Say, show me that craZy little walk<br> you did there. Slow it down some.<br> I liked that guitar. It sounded good.<br> I started moving around to the music,<br> swinging my hips.<br> This one night,<br> me and Mama was out shopping,<br> and we walked by Benson's furniture<br> and appliance store, and guess what?<br> This is not for children's eyes.<br> Some years later, that handsome<br> young man who they called The King,<br> well, he sung too many songs.<br> Had himself a heart attack<br> or something.<br> It must be hard being a king.<br> It's funny how you remember some<br> things, but some things you can't.<br> - You do your very best now, Forrest.<br> - I sure will, Mama.<br> I remember the bus ride<br> on the first day of school very well.<br> Are you coming along?<br> Mama said not to take rides<br> from strangers.<br> This is the bus to school.<br> - I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.<br> - I'm Dorothy Harris.<br> Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.<br> This seat's taken.<br> It's taken.<br> You can't sit here.<br> You know, it's funny what<br> a young man recollects,<br> 'cause I don't remember being born.<br> I don't recall what I got<br> for my first Christmas,<br> and I don't know when I went<br> on my first outdoor picnic,<br> but I do remember<br> the first time I heard<br> the sweetest voice in the wide world.<br> You can sit here if you want.<br> I had never seen anything<br> so beautiful in my life.<br> She was like an angel.<br> Well, are you going<br> to sit down or aren't you?<br> What's wrong with your legs?<br> Nothing at all, thank you.<br> My legs are just fine and dandy.<br> I just sat next to her on that bus<br> and had a conversation<br> all the way to school.<br> My back's crooked<br> like a question mark.<br> Next to Mama, no one ever talked<br> to me or asked me questions.<br> Are you stupid or something?<br> Mama says,<br> "Stupid is as stupid does."<br> - I'm Jenny.<br> - I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.<br> From that day on,<br> we was always together.<br> Jenny and me<br> was like peas and carrots.<br> She taught me how to climb.<br> Come on, Forrest, you can do it.<br> I showed her how to dangle.<br> She helped me learn how to read,<br> and I showed her how to swing.<br> Sometimes, we'd just sit out<br> and wait for the stars.<br> - Mama's going to worry about me.<br> - Just stay a little longer.<br> For some reason,<br> Jenny never wanted to go home.<br> OK, Jenny, I'll stay.<br> She was my most special friend.<br> My only friend.<br> My Mama always told me<br> that miracles happen every day.<br> Some people don't think so,<br> but they do.<br> Hey, dummy!<br> Are you retarded,<br> or just plain stupid?<br> - Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.<br> - Just run away, Forrest.<br> Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!<br> - Get the bikes!<br> - Let's get him! Come on!<br> Look out, dummy!<br> We're going to get you!<br> Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!<br> Come back here, you!<br> Run, Forrest! Run!<br> You wouldn't<br> believe it if I told you,<br> but I can run like the wind blows.<br> From that day on, if I was<br> going somewhere, I was running.<br> That boy sure is a running fool.<br> Remember how I told you that Jenny<br> never seemed to want to go home?<br> She lived in a house<br> that was as old as Alabama.<br> Her mama had gone to heaven<br> when she was five,<br> and her daddy was<br> some kind of a farmer.<br> Jenny?<br> He was a very loving man.<br> He was always kissing<br> and touching her and her sisters.<br> And then this one time, Jenny<br> wasn't on the bus to go to school.<br> Jenny,<br> why didn't you come to school today?<br> Daddy's taking a nap.<br> Come on!<br> Jenny, where'd you run to?<br> You better get back here, girl!<br> Where you at?<br> Jenny! Jenny, where you at?<br> Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.<br> Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly<br> far, far, far away from here.<br> Dear God, make me a bird<br> so I can fly far...<br> Mama always said God is mysterious.<br> He didn't turn Jenny<br> into a bird that day.<br> Instead, he had the police say<br> Jenny didn't have to stay<br> in that house no more.<br> She was to live with her grandma,<br> just over on Creekmore Avenue,<br> which made me happy,<br> 'cause she was so close.<br> Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out<br> and come on over to my house,<br> Just 'cause she said she was scared.<br> Scared of what, I don't know.<br> But I think it was her grandma's dog.<br> He was a mean dog.<br> Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends<br> all the way up through high school.<br> - Hey, stupid!<br> - Quit it!<br> Run, Forrest, run!<br> - Didn't you hear me, stupid?<br> - Run, Forrest!<br> Get in the truck!<br> Come on! He's getting away! Move it!<br> Run, Forrest! Run!<br> Run, Forrest!<br> Now, it used to be<br> I ran to get where I was going.<br> I never thought<br> it would take me anywhere.<br> Who in the hell is that?<br> That is Forrest Gump, coach.<br> Just a local idiot.<br> And can you believe it?<br> I got to go to college, too.<br> - Forrest, move it! Run!<br> - OK!<br> - Run!<br> - Run, you stupid son of a bitch!<br> Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!<br> He must be the stupidest son of<br> a bitch alive, but he sure is fast.<br> Now, maybe it's just me,<br> but college was very confusing times.<br> Federal troops,<br> enforcing a court order,<br> integrated<br> the University of Alabama today.<br> Two Negroes were admitted,<br> but only after Governor George<br> Wallace had carried out<br> his symbolic threat<br> to stand in the schoolhouse door.<br> Earl, what's going on?<br> Coons are trying to get into school.<br> Coons? When racoons<br> tried getting on our back porch,<br> Mama just chased them off<br> with a broom.<br> Not racoons, you idiot. Niggers.<br> They want to go to school with us.<br> With us? They do?<br> Shortly after Governor Wallace<br> had carried out his promise<br> to block the doorway,<br> President Kennedy<br> ordered the Secretary of Defence<br> to use military force.<br> Here, by videotape,<br> is the encounter by General Graham,<br> commander of the national guard,<br> and Governor Wallace.<br> Because these national guardsmen<br> are here today<br> as federal soldiers for Alabama,<br> and they live within our borders.<br> They are our brothers.<br> We are winning in this fight,<br> because we are awakening<br> the American people to the dangers<br> that we have spoken about<br> so many times, so evident today,<br> a trend toward military<br> dictatorship in this country.<br> And so, at day's end,<br> the University of Alabama<br> in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,<br> and students Jimmy Hood<br> and Vivian Malone<br> had been signed up<br> for summer classes.<br> Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am.<br> Governor Wallace<br> did what he promised.<br> By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,<br> he kept the mob from gathering...<br> - Say, wasn't that Gump?<br> - Naw, that couldn't be.<br> It sure as hell was.<br> A few years later, that angry<br> little man at the schoolhouse door<br> thought it'd be a good idea<br> and ran for President.<br> But somebody thought that it wasn't.<br> But he didn't die.<br> - My bus is here.<br> - Is it the number nine?<br> - No, it's the number four.<br> - It was nice talking to you.<br> I remember when that happened, when<br> Wallace got shot. I was in college.<br> Did you go to a girls college<br> or a girls and boys together college?<br> It was coed.<br> Jenny went to a college I couldn't go<br> to. It was a college just for girls.<br> But I'd go and visit her<br> every chance I got.<br> That hurts.<br> Forrest, stop it! Stop it!<br> What are you doing?<br> - He was hurting you.<br> - No, he wasn't! Get over there!<br> - Billy, I'm sorry.<br> - Just keep away from me.<br> Don't be such a... Don't go.<br> Billy, wait a second.<br> He doesn't know any better.<br> Forrest, why'd you do that?<br> I brought you some chocolate.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'll go back to my college now.<br> Look at you.<br> Come on. Come on.<br> Is this your own room?<br> Do you ever dream, Forrest,<br> about who you're going to be?<br> Who I'm going to be?<br> Aren't I going to be me?<br> You'll always be you,<br> Just another kind of you.<br> You know? I want to be famous.<br> I want to be a singer<br> like Joan BaeZ.<br> I just want to be on an empty stage<br> with my guitar, my voice.<br> Just me.<br> And I want to reach people<br> on a personal level.<br> I want to be able to say things,<br> just one to one.<br> Have you ever been with a girl,<br> Forrest?<br> I sit next to them in my home<br> economics class all the time.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - It's OK.<br> - Sorry.<br> It's all right.<br> - It's OK.<br> - I'm diZZy.<br> I'll bet that never<br> happened in home ec.<br> No.<br> I think I ruined<br> your roommate's bathrobe.<br> I don't care.<br> I don't like her anyway.<br> College ran by real fast<br> 'cause I played so much football.<br> They even put me on a thing<br> called the All-America team<br> where you get to meet the President<br> of the United States.<br> President Kennedy met with the<br> collegiate All-American football team<br> at the Oval Office today.<br> The really good thing about meeting<br> the President of the United States<br> is the food.<br> They put you in this little room<br> with just about anything<br> you'd want to eat or drink.<br> But since, number one,<br> I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,<br> and number two, they was free, I must<br> have drank about 15 Dr Peppers.<br> How does it feel<br> to be an All-American?<br> It's an honour, sir.<br> How does it feel<br> to be an All-American?<br> Very good, sir.<br> How does it feel<br> to be an All-American?<br> Very good, sir.<br> - Congratulations. How do you feel?<br> - I got to pee.<br> I believe he said he had to pee.<br> Some time later,<br> for no particular reason,<br> somebody shot that nice young<br> President when he was in his car.<br> And a few years after that, somebody<br> shot his little brother, too,<br> only he was in a hotel kitchen.<br> Must be hard being brothers.<br> I wouldn't know.<br> Now can you believe it?<br> After only five years of playing<br> football, I got a college degree.<br> Congratulations, son.<br> Mama was so proud.<br> Forrest, I'm so proud of you.<br> I'll hold this for you.<br> Congratulations, son.<br> Have you given<br> any thought to your future?<br> Thought?<br> Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.<br> Nobody gives a horse's shit<br> who you are, pus ball!<br> You're not even a lowlife,<br> scum-sucking maggot!<br> Get your maggoty ass on the bus!<br> You're in the army now!<br> - Seat's taken.<br> - Taken.<br> At first it seemed<br> like I made a mistake.<br> It was only my induction day,<br> and I was getting yelled at.<br> Sit down if you want to.<br> I didn't know who I might meet<br> or what they might ask.<br> You ever been on a real shrimp boat?<br> No. But I been on a real big boat.<br> I'm talking about<br> a shrimp catching boat.<br> I been working on shrimp boats<br> all my life.<br> I started out on my uncle's boat<br> when I was about maybe nine.<br> I was just looking into buying<br> my own boat and got drafted.<br> My given name<br> is Benjamin Buford Blue.<br> People call me Bubba, just like<br> one of them old redneck boys.<br> Can you believe that?<br> My name's Forrest Gump.<br> People call me Forrest Gump.<br> So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre,<br> Alabama, and his mama cooked shrimp.<br> And her mama before her<br> cooked shrimp,<br> and her mama before her mama<br> cooked shrimp, too.<br> Bubba's family knew<br> everything there was to know<br> about the shrimping business.<br> I know everything there is to know<br> about the shrimping business.<br> I'm going into the shrimping business<br> myself after I get out of the army.<br> Gump! What's your sole purpose<br> in this army?<br> To do whatever you tell me,<br> drill sergeant!<br> God damn it, Gump,<br> you're a goddamn genius.<br> That's the most outstanding answer<br> I've ever heard.<br> You must have a goddamn l.Q. of 160.<br> You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump.<br> Listen up, people!<br> For some reason, I fit in the army<br> like one of them round pegs.<br> It's not really hard.<br> You just make your bed neat,<br> remember to stand up straight,<br> and always answer every question<br> with "Yes, drill sergeant."<br> - Is that clear?<br> - Yes, drill sergeant!<br> What you do is<br> drag your nets along the bottom.<br> On a good day, you can catch<br> over a hundred pounds of shrimp.<br> Everything goes all right,<br> two men shrimping ten hours,<br> Iess what you spends on gas...<br> - Done, drill sergeant!<br> - Gump!<br> Why did you put that weapon<br> together so quickly?<br> You told me to, drill sergeant.<br> Jesus H. Christ.<br> This is a new company record.<br> If it wasn't a waste<br> of a fine enlisted man,<br> I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,<br> Private Gump.<br> You're going to be a general someday!<br> Now disassemble your weapon<br> and continue!<br> Anyway, like I was saying,<br> shrimp is the fruit of the sea.<br> You can barbecue it,<br> boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it.<br> There's shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole,<br> shrimp gumbo, pan fried,<br> deep fried, stir fried.<br> There's pineapple shrimp<br> and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp,<br> pepper shrimp,<br> shrimp soup, shrimp stew,<br> shrimp salad, shrimp in potatoes,<br> shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich.<br> That's about it.<br> Night-time in the army<br> is a lonely time.<br> We'd lay there in our bunks,<br> and I'd miss my mama,<br> and I'd miss Jenny.<br> Gump, get a load of the tits on her.<br> Turns out Jenny had gotten<br> into some trouble<br> over some photos of her<br> in her college sweater.<br> And she was thrown out of school.<br> But that wasn't a bad thing,<br> 'cause a man who owns a theatre<br> in Memphis, Tennessee,<br> saw those photos and offered Jenny<br> a job singing in a show.<br> The first chance I got,<br> I took the bus up to Memphis<br> to see her perform in that show.<br> That was Amber, Amber Flame.<br> Give her a big hand.<br> And now, for your listening<br> and viewing pleasure,<br> direct from Hollywood, California,<br> our very own beatnik beauty.<br> Let's give a big round of applause<br> to the luscious Bobbie Dylon.<br> Her dream had come true.<br> She was a folk singer.<br> - Come on baby, shake it up now!<br> - Somebody get her a harmonica.<br> - This ain't Captain Kangaroo!<br> - I got something here for you.<br> God damn it!<br> Hey, you stupid jerk!<br> I'm singing a song here.<br> Paulie, get out here!<br> Shut up!<br> Forrest! What are you doing here?<br> What are you doing?<br> What are you doing, Forrest?<br> Let me down!<br> You can't keep doing this, Forrest.<br> You can't keep trying to rescue me.<br> - They was trying to grab you.<br> - A lot of people try to grab me.<br> You can't keep<br> doing this all the time.<br> I can't help it. I love you.<br> You don't know what love is.<br> You remember that time<br> we prayed, Forrest?<br> We prayed for God to turn me<br> into a bird so I could fly far away?<br> Yes, I do.<br> You think<br> I could fly off this bridge?<br> What do you mean, Jenny?<br> Nothing.<br> I gotta get out of here.<br> - Wait, Jenny.<br> - Forrest, you stay away from me, OK?<br> Just stay away from me, please.<br> - Can I have a ride?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I don't care.<br> - Get in the truck.<br> So bye-bye, Jenny.<br> They sending me to vietnam.<br> It's this whole other country.<br> Just hang on a minute.<br> Listen, you promise me something, OK?<br> Just if you're ever in trouble,<br> don't be brave.<br> - You just run, OK? Just run away.<br> - OK.<br> I'll write you all the time.<br> And just like that, she was gone.<br> You come back safe to me.<br> Do you hear?<br> They told us that vietnam<br> was going to be very different<br> from the United States of America.<br> Except for all the beer cans<br> and barbecues, it was.<br> I'll bet there's shrimp<br> all in these waters.<br> They tell me these vietnams<br> is good shrimp.<br> After we win this war<br> and we take over everything,<br> we can get American shrimpers out<br> here and shrimp these waters.<br> Just shrimp all the time, man.<br> - You must be my FNGs.<br> - Morning, sir.<br> Get your hands down.<br> Do not salute me.<br> There are goddamn snipers<br> all around this area<br> who'd love to grease an officer.<br> I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.<br> Welcome to Fort Platoon.<br> - What's wrong with your lip?<br> - I was born with big gums, sir.<br> Well, you better tuck that in.<br> Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.<br> Where are you boys from in the world?<br> - Alabama, sir!<br> - You twins?<br> No. We are not relations, sir.<br> Look, it's pretty basic here.<br> You stick with me and learn<br> from the guys who've been in country<br> a while, you'll be all right.<br> There is one item of G.I. gear<br> that can be the difference<br> between life and death. Socks.<br> Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.<br> Try and keep your feet dry.<br> When we're out humpin',<br> change your socks whenever we stop.<br> The Mekong will eat<br> a grunt's feet right off his legs.<br> Sergeant Sims. God damn it, where's<br> that sling rope I said to order?<br> - I put in the requisitions.<br> - Well, call those sons of bitches...<br> Lieutenant Dan knew his stuff. I felt<br> real lucky he was my lieutenant.<br> He was from a long,<br> great military tradition.<br> Somebody in his family<br> had fought and died<br> in every single American war.<br> God damn it, kick some ass.<br> Get on it!<br> I guess you could say<br> he had a lot to live up to.<br> So, you boys from Arkansas?<br> Well, I been through there.<br> Little Rock's a fine town.<br> Now, shake down your gear.<br> See the platoon sergeant.<br> Draw what you need for the field.<br> If you boys are hungry, we got<br> steaks burning right over here.<br> Two standing orders in this platoon.<br> One, take good care of your feet.<br> Two, try not to do anything stupid,<br> like getting yourself killed.<br> I sure hope I don't let him down.<br> I got to see a lot of countryside.<br> We would take these real long walks.<br> And we were always lookin'<br> for this guy named Charlie.<br> - Hold it up!<br> - Hold up, boys!<br> It wasn't always fun.<br> Lieutenant Dan was always getting<br> these funny feelings<br> about a rock or a trail or the road,<br> so he'd tell us to get down, shut up.<br> Get down! Shut up!<br> So we did.<br> I don't know much about anything,<br> but I think some of America's<br> best young men served in this war.<br> There was Dallas from Phoenix.<br> Cleveland, he was from Detroit.<br> Hey, Tex. What the hell's going on?<br> And Tex was... Well, I don't<br> remember where Tex come from.<br> Ah, nothing.<br> Fourth platoon, on your feet.<br> Y'all got 10 clicks<br> to go to that river. Move out.<br> - One, two, hup!<br> - Step it up! Look alive out there.<br> The good thing about vietnam<br> is there was always someplace to go.<br> Fire in the hole!<br> Gump, check out that hole.<br> And there was always something to do.<br> Mount 'em up!<br> Spread out! Cover his back!<br> One day it started raining,<br> and it didn't quit for four months.<br> We've been through every<br> kind of rain there is.<br> Little bitty stinging rain<br> and big old fat rain,<br> rain that flew in sideways,<br> and sometimes rain even seemed<br> to come straight up from underneath.<br> Shoot, it even rained at night.<br> - Hey, Forrest.<br> - Hey, Bubba.<br> I'm going to lean up against you.<br> You lean up against me.<br> This way we don't have to sleep<br> with our heads in the mud.<br> You know why<br> we're a good partnership, Forrest?<br> 'Cause we be watching out for one<br> another, like brothers and stuff.<br> Hey, Forrest,<br> something I been thinking about.<br> I got a very important question<br> to ask you.<br> How would you like to go<br> into the shrimping business with me?<br> - OK.<br> - Man, I tell you what.<br> I got it all figured out, too.<br> So many pounds of shrimp<br> will pay off the boat.<br> So many pounds for gas.<br> We'll live right on the boat.<br> We ain't got to pay no rent.<br> We can just work it together, split<br> everything right down the middle.<br> Man, I'm telling you, 50-50. Hey,<br> Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat.<br> That's a fine idea.<br> Bubba did have a fine idea.<br> I even wrote Jenny<br> and told her all about it.<br> I sent her letters.<br> Not every day, but almost.<br> I told her what I was doing<br> and asked her what she was doing,<br> and told her<br> how I thought about her always.<br> And how I was looking forward<br> to getting a letter from her<br> Just as soon as she had the time.<br> I'd always let her know<br> that I was OK.<br> Then I'd sign each letter<br> "Love, Forrest Gump."<br> This one day,<br> we was out walking like always,<br> and then, just like that,<br> somebody turned off the rain,<br> and the sun come out.<br> Ambush! Take cover!<br> - Get that pig up here, God damn it!<br> - Forrest, are you OK?<br> Strong Arm, Strong Arm!<br> - We've got a man down.<br> - Strong Arm, this is Leg Lima 6!<br> Roger, Strong Arm! We have incoming<br> from the treeline at Point Blue...<br> ..plus two! A.K.s and rockets!<br> We're getting it hard!<br> - Misfire! Misfire!<br> - God damn it!<br> Get that pig unfucked<br> and put it in the treeline!<br> They got us down, hard and hurt.<br> We're going to move back<br> to the blue line.<br> Pull back! Pull back!<br> - Forrest! Run, Forrest!<br> - Pull back!<br> - Run! Run, man! Run!<br> - Pull back, Gump!<br> Run, God damn it! Run!<br> I ran and ran<br> Just like Jenny told me to.<br> I ran so far so fast that soon I was<br> all by myself, which was a bad thing.<br> Bubba was my best good friend.<br> I had to make sure he was OK.<br> Where the hell are you?<br> And on my way back to find Bubba,<br> there was a boy laying on the ground.<br> Tex. OK.<br> I couldn't let him lay there<br> all alone, scared the way he was,<br> so I grabbed him up<br> and run him out of there.<br> Every time I went back<br> looking for Bubba,<br> somebody else was saying,<br> "Help me, Forrest, help me!"<br> OK. Here. Here.<br> No sweat, man.<br> Lay back. You'll be OK.<br> I started to get scared<br> that I might never find Bubba.<br> I know my position is danger close!<br> We got Charlie all over this area.<br> I got to have those fast movers<br> in here now. Over.<br> Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!<br> I know he's dead! My whole<br> goddamn platoon is wiped out!<br> God damn it! What are you doing?<br> You leave me here!<br> Get away.<br> Just leave me here! Get out!<br> God, I said leave me here,<br> God damn it!<br> Leg Lima six, this is strong-arm.<br> Be advised your fast<br> movers are inbound. Over.<br> Then it felt like something<br> Just jumped up and bit me.<br> Something bit me!<br> Goddamn son of a bitch!<br> I can't leave the platoon.<br> I told you to leave me there, Gump.<br> Forget about me. Get yourself out!<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> Gump, damn it, put me down.<br> Get your ass out of here.<br> I didn't ask you to pull me out<br> of there, God damn you!<br> - Where do you think you're going?<br> - To get Bubba.<br> I got an air strike<br> inbound right now.<br> They're going to nape the whole area.<br> Stay here! That's an order.<br> I gotta find Bubba!<br> I'm OK, Forrest. I'm OK.<br> - Bubba, no.<br> - I'll be all right.<br> Come on. Come on. Come on.<br> I'm OK, Forrest.<br> I'm OK. I'm fine.<br> Top smoke. Get it up there.<br> If I'd have known this was going<br> to be the last time me and Bubba<br> was gonna talk, I'd of thought<br> of something better to say.<br> - Hey, Bubba.<br> - Hey, Forrest.<br> - Forrest, why did this happen?<br> - You got shot.<br> Then Bubba said something<br> I won't ever forget.<br> I want to go home.<br> Bubba was my best good friend.<br> And even I know that ain't something<br> you can find just around the corner.<br> Bubba was going to be<br> a shrimping boat captain,<br> but instead, he died right<br> there by that river in Vietnam.<br> That's all I have to say about that.<br> It was a bullet, wasn't it?<br> - A bullet?<br> - That jumped up and bit you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Bit me directly in the but-tocks.<br> They said it was a million<br> dollar wound, but...<br> The army must keep that money,<br> 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel<br> of that million dollars.<br> The only good thing<br> about being wounded in the but-tocks<br> is the ice cream.<br> They gave me all the ice cream<br> I could eat. And guess what?<br> A good friend of mine was<br> in the bed right next door.<br> Lieutenant Dan,<br> I got you some ice cream.<br> Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!<br> It's time for your bath,<br> Lieutenant.<br> Harper!<br> Cooper. Larson.<br> Webster. Gump.<br> - Gump!<br> - I'm Forrest Gump.<br> Kyle. Nichols.<br> McMill. Johnson.<br> Gump, how can you watch<br> that stupid shit? Turn it off.<br> You are tuned to the American Forces<br> Vietnam Network.<br> This is Channel 6, Saigon.<br> Good catch, Gump.<br> You know how to play this?<br> Come on. Let me show you.<br> The secret to this game is<br> no matter what happens,<br> never, ever take your eye<br> off the ball.<br> All right.<br> For some reason, ping-pong<br> came very natural to me.<br> See? Any idiot can play.<br> So I started playing it all the time.<br> I played ping-pong even when I didn't<br> have anyone to play ping-pong with.<br> The hospital's people said it<br> made me look like a duck in water,<br> whatever that means.<br> Even Lieutenant Dan<br> would come and watch me play.<br> I played ping-pong so much,<br> I even played it in my sleep.<br> Now, you listen to me.<br> We all have a destiny.<br> Nothing just happens.<br> It's all part of a plan!<br> I should have died<br> out there with my men,<br> but now, I'm nothing but<br> a goddamn cripple, a legless freak!<br> Look. Look! Look at me!<br> You see that?<br> Do you know what it's like<br> not to be able to use your legs?<br> Yes, sir, I do.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> You cheated me! I had a destiny.<br> I was supposed to die in the field<br> with honour!<br> That was my destiny,<br> and you cheated me out of it!<br> You understand what I'm saying, Gump?<br> This wasn't supposed to happen,<br> not to me. I had a destiny.<br> I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.<br> You're still Lieutenant Dan.<br> Look at me.<br> What am I going to do now?<br> What am I going to do now?<br> PFC Gump?<br> - Yes, sir!<br> - As you were.<br> Son, you been awarded<br> the Medal of Honour.<br> Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?<br> They want to give me a med...<br> Ma'am, what did they do<br> with Lieutenant Dan?<br> They sent him home.<br> Two weeks later, I left vietnam.<br> The ceremony was kicked off<br> with a candid speech by the President<br> regarding the need for further<br> escalation of the war in Vietnam.<br> President Johnson awarded four medals<br> of honour to men from each...<br> America owes you<br> a debt of gratitude, son.<br> I understand you were wounded.<br> Where were you hit?<br> In the but-tocks, sir.<br> Well, that must be a sight.<br> I'd kinda like to see that.<br> God damn, son!<br> After that, Mama went<br> to the hotel to lay down,<br> so I went out for a walk<br> to see our capital.<br> Hilary! I got the vets.<br> What do you want to do with them?<br> It's a good thing Mama was resting,<br> 'cause the streets was<br> awful crowded with people<br> Iookin' at all the statues<br> and monuments,<br> and some of them people<br> were loud and pushy.<br> OK, follow me! Move it out!<br> Everywhere I went,<br> I had to stand in line.<br> Come on. Go!<br> You're a good man<br> for doing this. Good.<br> OK.<br> There was this man<br> giving a little talk.<br> And for some reason, he was wearing<br> an American flag for a shirt.<br> And he liked to say<br> the "F" Word a lot.<br> "F" This and "F" That.<br> And every time he said the "F" Word,<br> people, for some reason, cheered.<br> Come on, man. Come up here, man.<br> Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!<br> Come on. Move, move!<br> Go on. Let's get up there.<br> Tell us a little bit<br> about the war, man.<br> - The war in vietnam?<br> - The war in Viet-fuckin'-nam!<br> Well...<br> There was only one thing<br> I could say about the war in Vietnam.<br> There's only one thing<br> I can say about the war in Vietnam.<br> In vietnam...<br> What the hell are you do...<br> I'll beat your head in,<br> you goddamn oinker!<br> Jesus Christ!<br> What did they do with this?<br> Can't hear you!<br> Can't hear anything!<br> This... This one! Give me that!<br> Speak up!<br> That's it.<br> And that's all I have to say<br> about that.<br> That's so right on, man.<br> You said it all.<br> - What's your name, man?<br> - My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.<br> - Forrest Gump.<br> - Gump!<br> It was the happiest moment<br> of my life.<br> Jenny and me were just<br> like peas and carrots again.<br> She showed me around and introduced<br> me to some of her new friends.<br> Shut that blind, man! And get your<br> white ass away from that window.<br> Don't you know we in a war here?<br> - He's cool. He's one of us.<br> - Let me tell you about us.<br> Our purpose here<br> is to protect our black leaders<br> from the racial onslaught of the pig<br> who wishes to brutalise<br> our black leaders,<br> rape our women,<br> and destroy our black communities.<br> - Who's the baby killer?<br> - This is my friend I told you about.<br> This is Forrest Gump.<br> Forrest, this is Wesley.<br> Wesley and l<br> lived together in Berkeley,<br> and he's the president<br> of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.<br> We are here to offer<br> protection and help<br> for all those who need our help,<br> because we, the Black Panthers,<br> are against the war in vietnam.<br> We are against any war where black<br> soldiers are sent to the front line<br> to die for a country that hates them.<br> We are against any war<br> where black soldiers go to fight<br> and come to be brutalised<br> and killed in their own communities.<br> We are against all these racist<br> and imperial acts...<br> Forrest! Stop it! Stop it!<br> I shouldn't have brought you here.<br> I should have known it was going<br> to be some bullshit hassle!<br> He should not be hitting you, Jenny.<br> Come on, Forrest.<br> Sorry I had a fight in the middle<br> of your Black Panther party.<br> He doesn't mean it<br> when he does things like this.<br> I would never hurt you, Jenny.<br> - I know you wouldn't, Forrest.<br> - I wanted to be your boyfriend.<br> That uniform is a trip, Forrest.<br> You look handsome in it. You do.<br> - You know what?<br> - What?<br> I'm glad we were here together<br> in our nation's capital.<br> Me, too, Forrest.<br> We walked around all night,<br> Jenny and me, just talkin'.<br> She told me about<br> all the travelling she'd done<br> and how she discovered<br> ways to expand her mind<br> and learn how to live in harmony,<br> which must be out west somewhere,<br> 'cause she made it<br> all the way to California.<br> Hey. Anybody<br> want to go to San Francisco?<br> - I'll go.<br> - Far out!<br> It was a very special night<br> for the two of us.<br> I didn't want it to end.<br> - Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.<br> - I have to, Forrest.<br> Jenny?<br> Things got a little out of hand.<br> It's just this war and that lying<br> son of a bitch Johnson and...<br> I would never hurt you.<br> You know that.<br> Know what I think?<br> I think you should go home<br> to Greenbow, Alabama!<br> Forrest, we have very different<br> lives, you know.<br> I want you to have this.<br> Forrest, I can't keep this.<br> I got it just by doing<br> what you told me to do.<br> - Why are you so good to me?<br> - You're my girl.<br> I'll always be your girl.<br> And just like that,<br> she was gone out of my life again.<br> It's one small step for man,<br> one giant leap for mankind.<br> I thought I was going back<br> to Vietnam, but instead they decided<br> the best way for me to fight<br> the communists was to play ping-pong,<br> so I was in the Special Services,<br> travelling around the country,<br> cheering up wounded veterans and<br> showing 'em how to play ping-pong.<br> I was so good,<br> the Army decided I should be<br> on the All-American ping-pong team.<br> We were the first Americans<br> to visit the land of China<br> in a million years or something.<br> Somebody said world peace<br> was in our hands,<br> but all I did was play ping-pong.<br> When I got home,<br> I was a national celebrity,<br> famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.<br> Here he is, Forrest Gump. Right here.<br> - Forrest Gump, John Lennon.<br> - Welcome home.<br> Can you tell us, what was China like?<br> In the land of China,<br> people hardly got nothin' at all.<br> No possessions?<br> And in China,<br> they never go to church.<br> - No religion, too?<br> - Hard to imagine.<br> Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.<br> Some years later,<br> that nice young man from England<br> was on his way home to see his little<br> boy and was signing some autographs.<br> For no particular reason at all,<br> somebody shot him.<br> They gave you<br> The Congressional Medal of Honour.<br> Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.<br> Lieutenant Dan!<br> They gave you<br> the Congressional Medal of Honour.<br> Yes, sir. They surely did.<br> They gave you, an imbecile,<br> a moron who goes on television<br> and makes a fool out of himself<br> in front of the whole damn country,<br> the Congressional Medal of Honour.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, that's just perfect!<br> Well, I just got one thing to say<br> to that. Goddamn bless America.<br> Lieutenant Dan!<br> Lieutenant Dan<br> said he was living in a hotel.<br> Because he didn't have no legs, he<br> spent his time exercising his arms.<br> Take a right. Take a right!<br> Come on, already!<br> What do you do here in New York,<br> Lieutenant Dan?<br> I'm living off the government tit.<br> Are you blind? I'm walking here!<br> Get out! Come on. Go, go, go!<br> I stayed with Lieutenant Dan<br> and celebrated the holidays.<br> You have a great year,<br> and hurry home. God bless you.<br> Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?<br> I didn't know I was supposed<br> to be looking for him, sir.<br> That's all these cripples at the vA,<br> that's all they ever talk about.<br> Jesus this and Jesus that.<br> Have I found Jesus?<br> They even had a priest<br> come and talk to me.<br> He said God is listening,<br> but I have to help myself.<br> Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart,<br> I'll get to walk beside him<br> in the kingdom of heaven.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> Walk beside him<br> in the kingdom of heaven.<br> Well, kiss my crippled ass. God<br> is listening? What a crock of shit.<br> I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.<br> Well...<br> Before you go, why don't you<br> get your ass down to the corner<br> - and get us more ripple?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> We're at approximately 45th street<br> in New York City at One Astor PlaZa.<br> This is the site<br> of the old Astor Hotel...<br> - What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?<br> - Shrimping boats.<br> Shrimping boats? Who gives a shit<br> about shrimping boats?<br> I got to buy me one<br> soon as I have some money.<br> I promised Bubba in vietnam<br> that as soon as the war was over,<br> we'd be partners.<br> He'd be the captain<br> and I'd be his first mate.<br> But now that he's dead,<br> I got to be the captain.<br> A shrimp boat captain.<br> Yes, sir. A promise is a promise,<br> Lieutenant Dan.<br> Now hear this!<br> Private Gump here is gonna be<br> a shrimp boat captain.<br> Tell you what, Gilligan. The day<br> you are a shrimp boat captain,<br> I will come and be your first mate.<br> If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,<br> that's the day I'm an astronaut!<br> Danny, what are you complaining<br> about? How you doing?<br> - Mr Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?<br> - My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.<br> This is Cunning Carla<br> and Long-limbs Lenore.<br> So where you been, babycakes?<br> Haven't seen you around lately.<br> You should have been here<br> for Christmas,<br> 'cause Tommy bought a free round<br> and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.<br> Well, I had company.<br> We was just there!<br> That's Times Square.<br> Don't you just love New Year's?<br> You can start all over.<br> Everybody gets a second chance.<br> It's funny,<br> but in the middle of all that fun,<br> I began to think about Jenny,<br> wondering how she was spending her<br> New Year's night out in California.<br> Nine, eight, seven, six,<br> five, four, three, two, one!<br> Happy New Year!<br> Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!<br> What are you, stupid or something?<br> What's your problem?<br> What's his problem? Did you lose<br> your packet in the war or something?<br> - Is your friend stupid or something?<br> - What did you say?<br> I said is your friend<br> stupid or something?<br> - Don't call him stupid!<br> - Hey, don't push her!<br> You shut up!<br> Don't you ever call him stupid!<br> Why you so upset?<br> Get your goddamn clothes<br> and get the hell out of here!<br> You should be in a sideshow.<br> You're so pathetic!<br> Get out of here!<br> - You retard!<br> - Loser. You freak!<br> Oh, no.<br> I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's<br> Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.<br> She tastes like cigarettes.<br> I guess Lieutenant Dan figured<br> there's some things you can't change.<br> He didn't want to be called crippled<br> Iike I didn't want<br> to be called stupid.<br> Happy New Year, Gump.<br> The U.S. ping-pong team met<br> with President Nixon today...<br> Wouldn't you know it?<br> A few months later,<br> they invited me and the ping-pong<br> team to visit the White House.<br> So I went, again.<br> And I met the President<br> of the United States again.<br> Only this time, they didn't get us<br> rooms in a real fancy hotel.<br> Are you enjoying yourself<br> in our nation's capital, young man?<br> - Where are you staying?<br> - It's called the Hotel Ebbott.<br> Oh, no. I know a much nicer hotel.<br> It's brand-new. very modern.<br> I'll have my people take care of it.<br> - Security.<br> - Yeah. Sir...<br> You might want to send a maintenance<br> man to that office across the way.<br> The lights are off and they must be<br> looking for a fuse box,<br> 'cause them flashlights,<br> they're keeping me awake.<br> - OK, sir. I'll check it out.<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> Therefore,<br> I shall resign the presidency<br> effective at noon tomorrow.<br> Vice President Ford<br> will be sworn in as President<br> at that hour in this office.<br> - Forrest Gump.<br> - Yes, sir!<br> As you were. I have your<br> discharge papers. Service is up, son.<br> Does this mean<br> I can't play ping-pong no more?<br> For the Army, it does.<br> And just like that, my service<br> in the United States Army was over.<br> So I went home.<br> - I'm home, Mama.<br> - I know. I know.<br> Louise, he's here.<br> When I got home, I had no idea,<br> but Mama'd had all sorts of visitors.<br> We've had all sorts of visitors.<br> Everybody wants you to use<br> their ping-pong stuff.<br> One man even left a check for $25,000<br> if you'd be agreeable to saying<br> you like using their paddle.<br> I only like using my own paddle.<br> - Hi, Miss Louise.<br> - Hey, Forrest.<br> I know that,<br> but it's $25,000, Forrest.<br> I thought maybe<br> you could hold it for a while,<br> see if it grows on you.<br> That Mama, she sure was right.<br> It's funny how things work out.<br> I didn't stay home for long<br> because I'd made a promise to Bubba,<br> and I always try to keep my promise,<br> so I went on down to Bayou La Batre<br> to meet Bubba's family.<br> Are you craZy or just plain stupid?<br> - Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs Blue.<br> - I guess.<br> And, of course,<br> I paid my respect to Bubba himself.<br> Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump.<br> I remember everything you said,<br> and I got it all figured out.<br> I'm taking $24,562.47 that I got,<br> that's left after a new haircut<br> and a new suit<br> and I took Mama out<br> to a real fancy dinner,<br> and I bought a bus ticket,<br> and three Dr Peppers.<br> Tell me something.<br> Are you stupid or something?<br> Stupid is as stupid does, sir.<br> That's what's left after me saying,<br> "When I was in China<br> on the All-America ping-pong team,<br> "l just loved playing ping-pong<br> "with my Flex-o-lite<br> ping-pong paddle,"<br> which everybody knows isn't true,<br> but Mama said it was just a little<br> white lie, it wasn't hurting nobody.<br> So anyway,<br> I'm putting all that on gas, ropes,<br> and new nets<br> and a brand-new shrimping boat.<br> Bubba told me everything<br> he knew about shrimping,<br> but you know what I found out?<br> Shrimping is tough.<br> I only caught five.<br> A couple more,<br> you can have yourself a cocktail.<br> You ever think about<br> naming this old boat?<br> It's bad luck<br> to have a boat without a name.<br> I'd never named a boat before,<br> but there was only one<br> I could think of,<br> the most beautiful name<br> in the wide world.<br> I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long<br> while, but I thought about her a lot.<br> I hoped whatever she was doing<br> made her happy.<br> I thought about Jenny all the time.<br> Lieutenant Dan,<br> what are you doing here?<br> Well, thought I'd try out<br> my sea legs.<br> Well, you ain't got no legs,<br> Lieutenant Dan.<br> Yes, I know that.<br> You wrote me a letter, you idiot.<br> Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.<br> I had to see this for myself.<br> And I told you if you were<br> ever a shrimp boat captain,<br> that I'd be your first mate.<br> Well, here I am.<br> - I'm a man of my word.<br> - OK.<br> But don't you be thinking that<br> I'm going to be calling you "Sir."<br> No, sir.<br> That's my boat.<br> I have a feeling if we head due east,<br> we'll find some shrimp.<br> So take a left.<br> - Take a left!<br> - Which way?<br> Over there! They're over there!<br> - Get on the wheel and take a left.<br> - OK.<br> Gump, what are you doing?<br> Take a left! Left!<br> That's where we're going<br> to find those shrimp, my boy!<br> That's where we'll find them.<br> - Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.<br> - OK, so I was wrong.<br> How are we going to find them?<br> Maybe you should<br> Just pray for shrimp.<br> So I went to church every Sunday.<br> Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came too,<br> though he left the praying up to me.<br> - No shrimp.<br> - Where the hell's this God of yours?<br> It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,<br> 'cause right then God showed up.<br> You'll never sink this boat!<br> Now, me, I was scared,<br> but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.<br> Come on!<br> You call this a storm?<br> Come on, you son of a bitch!<br> It's time for a showdown! You and me!<br> I'm right here! Come and get me!<br> You'll never sink this boat!<br> Hurricane Carmen<br> came through here yesterday,<br> destroying nearly everything<br> in its path.<br> And as in other towns<br> up and down the coast,<br> Bayou La Batre's<br> entire shrimping industry<br> has fallen victim to Carmen<br> and has been left in utter ruin.<br> This reporter has learned,<br> in fact, only one shrimping boat<br> actually survived the storm.<br> Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.<br> After that, shrimping was easy.<br> Since people still needed<br> them shrimps for shrimp cocktails<br> and barbecues and all, and we were<br> the only boat left standing,<br> Bubba-Gump shrimp's what they got.<br> We got a whole bunch of boats.<br> Twelve Jennys, big old warehouse.<br> We even have hats<br> that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.<br> Bubba-Gump Shrimp. A household name.<br> Hold on there, boy.<br> Are you telling me you're the owner<br> of the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?<br> Yes. We got more money<br> than Davy Crockett.<br> Boy, I heard some whoppers<br> in my time, but that tops them all.<br> We were sitting<br> next to a millionaire.<br> Well, I thought it was<br> a very lovely story,<br> and you tell it so well,<br> with such enthusiasm.<br> Would you like to see<br> what Lieutenant Dan looks like?<br> Yes, I would.<br> That's him right there.<br> Let me tell you something<br> about Lieutenant Dan.<br> I never thanked you<br> for saving my life.<br> He never actually said so, but<br> I think he made his peace with God.<br> For the second time in 17 days,<br> President Ford escaped<br> possible assassination today.<br> - Base to Jenny 1. Base to Jenny 1.<br> - Jenny 1. Go, Margo.<br> Forrest has a phone call.<br> Well, you'll have to tell them<br> to call him back.<br> - He is indisposed at the moment.<br> - His mama's sick.<br> - Where's Mama?<br> - She's upstairs.<br> Hi, Forrest.<br> - I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - All right.<br> Sure got you straightened out,<br> didn't we, boy?<br> - What's the matter, Mama?<br> - I'm dying, Forrest.<br> Come on in, sit down over here.<br> - Why are you dying, Mama?<br> - It's my time. It's just my time.<br> Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.<br> Death is just a part of life.<br> Something we're all destined to do.<br> I didn't know it,<br> but I was destined to be your mama.<br> - I did the best I could.<br> - You did good.<br> Well, I happen to believe<br> you make your own destiny.<br> You have to do the best<br> with what God gave you.<br> What's my destiny, Mama?<br> You're going to have<br> to figure that out for yourself.<br> Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.<br> You never know<br> what you're going to get.<br> Mama always had a way of explaining<br> things so I could understand them.<br> I will miss you, Forrest.<br> She had got the cancer<br> and died on a Tuesday.<br> I bought her a new hat<br> with little flowers on it.<br> And that's all<br> I have to say about that.<br> Didn't you say you were waiting<br> for the number seven bus?<br> There'll be another one<br> along shortly.<br> Now, because I had been<br> a football star and war hero<br> and national celebrity<br> and a shrimping boat captain<br> and a college graduate, the city<br> fathers of Greenbow, Alabama,<br> decided to get together<br> and offered me a fine job.<br> So I never went back<br> to work for Lieutenant Dan,<br> though he did take care<br> of my Bubba-Gump money.<br> He got me invested<br> in some kind of fruit company.<br> I got a call from him saying we don't<br> have to worry about money no more,<br> and I said,<br> "That's good. One less thing."<br> Now Mama said there's only<br> so much fortune a man really needs,<br> and the rest is just for showing off.<br> So I gave a whole bunch of it<br> to the Foursquare Gospel Church.<br> And I gave a whole bunch to the<br> Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.<br> And even though Bubba was dead<br> and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,<br> I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.<br> You know what?<br> She didn't have to work<br> in nobody's kitchen no more.<br> That smells wonderful.<br> And 'cause I was a goZillionaire<br> and I liked doing it so much,<br> I cut that grass for free.<br> But at night-time<br> when there was nothing to do<br> and the house was all empty,<br> I'd always think of Jenny.<br> And then, she was there.<br> - Hello, Forrest.<br> - Hello, Jenny.<br> Jenny came back and stayed with me.<br> Maybe it was because<br> she had nowhere else to go,<br> or maybe it was because she was<br> so tired, 'cause she went to bed<br> and slept and slept,<br> like she hadn't slept in years.<br> It was wonderful having her home.<br> Every day we'd take a walk, and l'd<br> jabber on like a monkey in a tree,<br> and she'd listen about<br> ping-ponging and shrimping<br> and Mama making a trip up to heaven.<br> I did all the talking.<br> Jenny most of the time<br> was real quiet.<br> How could you do this?<br> Sometimes I guess there<br> Just aren't enough rocks.<br> I never really knew<br> why she came back, but I didn't care.<br> It was like olden times.<br> We was like peas and carrots again.<br> Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers<br> and put them in her room for her,<br> and she gave me the best gift anyone<br> could ever get in the wide world.<br> They're just for running.<br> And she even showed me how to dance.<br> Well, we was like family,<br> Jenny and me...<br> and it was the happiest time<br> in my life.<br> You done watching it?<br> I'm going to bed.<br> Will you marry me?<br> I'd make a good husband, Jenny.<br> You would, Forrest.<br> But you won't marry me.<br> You don't want to marry me.<br> Why don't you love me, Jenny?<br> I'm not a smart man,<br> but I know what love is.<br> Forrest, I do love you.<br> - Where are you running off to?<br> - I'm not running.<br> That day, for no particular reason,<br> I decided to go for a little run.<br> So I ran to the end of the road,<br> and when I got there<br> I thought maybe I'd run<br> to the end of town.<br> President Carter,<br> suffering from heat exhaustion...<br> And when I got there,<br> I thought maybe I'd just<br> run across Greenbow County.<br> Now, thinking since I'd run this far,<br> maybe I'd just run across<br> the great state of Alabama.<br> And that's what I did.<br> I ran clear across Alabama.<br> No particular reason.<br> I just kept on going.<br> I ran clear to the ocean.<br> And when I got there,<br> I figured since I'd gone this far,<br> might as well turn around,<br> just keep on going.<br> And when I got to another ocean,<br> I figured since I'd gone this far,<br> I might as well just turn back<br> and keep right on going.<br> When I got tired, I slept.<br> When I got hungry, I ate.<br> When I had to go...<br> you know... I went.<br> - And so, you just ran.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'd think a lot about Mama<br> and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.<br> But most of all, I thought about<br> Jenny. I thought about her a lot.<br> For more than two years,<br> a man named Forrest Gump,<br> a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,<br> stopping only to sleep,<br> has been running across America.<br> Charles Cooper reports.<br> For the fourth time<br> on his journey across America,<br> Forrest Gump the gardener will cross<br> the Mississippi River again today.<br> - I'll be damned. Forrest?<br> - Why are you running?<br> - Are you doing this for world peace?<br> - For the homeless?<br> - Are you running for women's rights?<br> - The environment?<br> They couldn't believe somebody would<br> do all that running for no reason.<br> - Why are you doing this?<br> - I just felt like running.<br> I just felt like runnin'.<br> It's you.<br> I can't believe it's really you.<br> For some reason, what I was doing<br> seemed to make sense to people.<br> It was like an alarm<br> went off in my head.<br> I said, "Here's a guy<br> that's got his act together.<br> "Here's somebody who has the answer."<br> I'll follow you anywhere, Mr Gump.<br> So I got company.<br> And after that, I got more company.<br> And then, even more people joined in.<br> Somebody later told me<br> it gave people hope.<br> I don't know anything about that,<br> but some of those people asked me<br> if I could help them out.<br> I was wondering if you might help me.<br> I'm in the bumper sticker business.<br> I need a good slogan, and since<br> you've been so inspirational,<br> I thought<br> you might be able to help me...<br> Whoa, man! You just ran<br> through a big pile of dog shit!<br> - It happens.<br> - What, shit?<br> Sometimes.<br> And some years later, I heard<br> that that fella did come up<br> with a bumper sticker slogan<br> and made a lot of money off of it.<br> Another time, I was running along,<br> somebody who'd lost all his money<br> in the t-shirt business,<br> he wanted to put my face<br> on a t-shirt,<br> but he couldn't draw that well,<br> and he didn't have a camera.<br> Here, use this one.<br> Nobody likes that colour anyway.<br> Have a nice day.<br> Some years later,<br> I found out that that man did come up<br> with an idea for a t-shirt.<br> He made a lot of money.<br> Anyway, like I was saying,<br> I had a lot of company.<br> Mama always said, "Put the past<br> behind you before you can move on."<br> And I think<br> that's what my running was all about.<br> I had run for three years,<br> two months, 14 days and 16 hours.<br> Quiet. Quiet.<br> He's going to say something.<br> I'm pretty tired.<br> Think I'll go home now.<br> Now what are we supposed to do?<br> And just like that,<br> my runnin' days was over.<br> So I went home to Alabama.<br> Moments ago, at 2.25 p.m., as<br> President Reagan was leaving the...<br> ..five or six gunshots were fired<br> by an unknown would-be assassin.<br> The President was shot<br> in the chest...<br> I picked up the mail.<br> And one day, out of the blue clear<br> sky, I got a letter from Jenny<br> wondering if I could come down<br> to Savannah and see her,<br> and that's what I'm doing here.<br> She saw me on Tv, running.<br> I'm supposed to go on the number nine<br> bus to Richmond Street<br> and get off and go one block left<br> to 1947 Henry Street, apartment 4.<br> Why, you don't need to take a bus.<br> Henry Street is just five<br> or six blocks down that way.<br> - Down that way?<br> - Down that way.<br> It was nice talking to you.<br> I hope everything works out for you!<br> - How you doin'? Come in! Come in!<br> - I got your letter.<br> - I was wondering about that.<br> - This your house?<br> Yeah. It's messy right now.<br> I just got off work.<br> It's nice. You got air conditioning.<br> - Thank you.<br> - I ate some.<br> I kept a scrapbook of your clippings,<br> and everything. There you are.<br> And this, I got you running.<br> I ran a long way. It's a long time.<br> And there...<br> Listen, Forrest,<br> I don't know how to say this.<br> I just I want to apologise<br> for anything that I ever did to you<br> 'cause I was messed up<br> for a long time, and...<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey, you.<br> - This is an old friend from Alabama.<br> - How do you do?<br> Next week my schedule changes,<br> so I can...<br> No problem. Got to go.<br> I'm double-parked.<br> OK. Thanks.<br> This is my very good friend Mr Gump.<br> Can you say hi?<br> - Hello, Mr Gump.<br> - Hello.<br> - Can I go watch Tv now?<br> - Yes. Just keep it low.<br> - You're a mama, Jenny.<br> - I'm a mama.<br> - His name's Forrest.<br> - Like me!<br> - I named him after his daddy.<br> - He got a daddy named Forrest, too?<br> You're his daddy, Forrest.<br> Forrest, look at me.<br> Look at me, Forrest.<br> There's nothing you need to do.<br> You didn't do anything wrong. OK?<br> Isn't he beautiful?<br> He's the most beautiful thing<br> I've ever seen.<br> But...<br> Is he smart? Can he...<br> He's very smart. He's one<br> of the smartest in his class.<br> Yeah, it's OK. Go talk to him.<br> - What are you watching?<br> - Bert and Ernie.<br> Forrest, I'm sick.<br> What, do you have<br> a cough due to a cold?<br> I have some virus, and the doctors,<br> they don't know what it is,<br> and there isn't<br> anything they can do about it.<br> You could come home with me.<br> You and little Forrest could<br> come stay at my house in Greenbow.<br> I'll take care of you if you're sick.<br> Would you marry me, Forrest?<br> OK.<br> Please take your seats.<br> Forrest? It's time to start.<br> Hi. Your tie.<br> Lieutenant Dan.<br> - Lieutenant Dan.<br> - Hello, Forrest.<br> You got new legs. New legs!<br> Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.<br> Titanium alloy. It's what they use<br> on the space shuttle.<br> Magic legs.<br> This is my fiancee, Susan.<br> - Lieutenant Dan.<br> - Hi, Forrest.<br> - Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.<br> - Hi. It's nice to meet you finally.<br> Do you, Forrest, take Jenny<br> to be your wife?<br> Do you, Jenny,<br> take Forrest to be your husband?<br> And so I pronounce you man and wife.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> Were you scared in vietnam?<br> Yes. Well, I don't know.<br> Sometimes it would stop raining long<br> enough for the stars to come out.<br> And then it was nice.<br> It was like just before the sun<br> goes to bed down on the bayou.<br> There was always<br> a million sparkles on the water.<br> Like that mountain lake.<br> It was so clear, Jenny,<br> it looked like there were two skies<br> one on top of the other.<br> And then in the desert,<br> when the sun comes up,<br> I couldn't tell where heaven stopped<br> and the earth began.<br> It was so beautiful.<br> I wish I could've been there<br> with you.<br> You were.<br> I love you.<br> You died on a Saturday morning.<br> And I had you placed<br> here under our tree.<br> And I had that house of your father's<br> bulldoZed to the ground.<br> Mama always said<br> that dyin' was a part of life.<br> I sure wish it wasn't.<br> Little Forrest is doing just fine.<br> About to start school again soon,<br> and I make his breakfast,<br> lunch, and dinner every day.<br> I make sure he combs his hair<br> and brushes his teeth every day.<br> Teaching him how to play ping-pong.<br> He's really good.<br> Forrest, you go.<br> We fish a lot.<br> And every night, we read a book.<br> He's so smart, Jenny.<br> You'd be so proud of him. I am.<br> He wrote you a letter.<br> And he says I can't read it.<br> I'm not supposed to,<br> so I'll just leave it here for you.<br> I don't know if mama was right<br> or if it's Lieutenant Dan.<br> I don't know if<br> we each have a destiny,<br> or if we're all just floating around<br> accidental-like on a breeZe.<br> But I think maybe it's both.<br> Maybe both is happening<br> at the same time.<br> But I miss you, Jenny.<br> If there's anything you need,<br> I won't be far away.<br> Here's your bus. OK.<br> I know this.<br> I'm gonna share that for<br> show-and-tell<br> because Grandma<br> used to read it to you.<br> My favourite book.<br> Here you go.<br> Don't...<br> - I want to tell you I love you.<br> - I love you, too, Daddy.<br> I'll be right here when you get back.<br> You understand this is<br> the bus to school, don't you?<br> Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris,<br> and I'm Forrest Gump.<br>
