You look lovely.<br> Hello, Charles!<br> There's a greatness to your lateness.<br> It's not achieved<br> without real suffering.<br> I am so, so sorry.<br> I'll kill myself after the service,<br> if that's any consolation.<br> Doesn't matter. Tom was standing by.<br> Thanks, Tom. You're a saint.<br> And a disastrous haircut.<br> You haven't forgotten the rings?<br> No.<br> Hate people being late.<br> Here we go.<br> Oh, isn't she lovely?<br> Scarlett, you're blind.<br> She looks like a big meringue.<br> Dear friends, what a joy it is to<br> welcome you to our church...<br> ...on this wonderful day<br> for Angus and Laura.<br> Before we start the service,<br> let us all join together...<br> ...in the first hymn.<br> And did those feet...<br> ... in ancient time<br> Walk upon England's mountain green<br> And was the holy...<br> ... Lamb of God<br> On England's pleasant...<br> ... pastures seen<br> And did the countenance divine<br> Shine forth upon...<br> ... our clouded hills<br> And was Jerusalem...<br> ... builded here<br> Among those dark satanic mills<br> Scarlett.<br> Dearly beloved, we are<br> gathered here...<br> ...in the sight of God and in<br> the face of this congregation...<br> ...to join together this man<br> and this woman in holy matrimony.<br> Which is an honorable estate...<br> ...instituted in the time<br> of man's innocence.<br> - Back in a sec.<br> - If any man can show...<br> ...any just cause or impediment...<br> ...why they may not be lawfully<br> joined together...<br> ...let him speak now or forever<br> hold his peace.<br> Do you promise to love her...<br> ...comfort her, honor and keep her<br> in sickness and in health...<br> ...and forsaking all others...<br> ...keep thee only unto her for as<br> long as ye both shall live?<br> I do.<br> To love and to cherish...<br> Till death us do part.<br> ...till death us do part.<br> Thereto, I pledge thee my troth.<br> And thereto, I pledge thee my troth.<br> Do you have the ring?<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> With this ring, I thee wed.<br> With my body, I thee worship.<br> With my body, I thee worship.<br> And with all my worldly goods,<br> I do thee endow.<br> And with all my worldly goods,<br> I thee endow.<br> If I speak with the tongues of men<br> and of angels, but have not love...<br> ...I am become a sounding brass<br> or a clanging cymbal.<br> Good point.<br> You know I can't smile without you<br> Can't smile without you<br> I can't laugh and I can't sing<br> I'm finding it hard to do anything<br> You see, I feel sad when you're sad<br> I feel sad<br> I feel glad when you're glad<br> If you only knew<br> What I'm going through<br> Great hat.<br> Thanks. I bought it specially.<br> There.<br> Get in position, please.<br> Thank you. Smile.<br> Splendid, I thought.<br> What did you think?<br> I thought, splendid.<br> What did you think?<br> Splendid, I thought.<br> Scarlotta, fabulous dress!<br> Ecclesiastical purple<br> and pagan orange...<br> ...symbolize the magical<br> symbiosis in marriage...<br> ...between heathen and<br> Christian traditions?<br> That's right.<br> Lovely. And again.<br> Any idea who the girl<br> in the black hat is?<br> Name's Carrie.<br> She's pretty.<br> American.<br> Interesting.<br> Slut.<br> Really?<br> Used to work at Vogue.<br> Lives in America now.<br> Only goes out with<br> very glamorous people.<br> Quite out of your league.<br> Well, that's a relief. Thanks.<br> See you there.<br> Off you go.<br> Right. Reception.<br> Bye! Bye!<br> Anyone else tread in a cowpat?<br> No, thought not. See you in a mo.<br> Do you think I'd hate him as much<br> if he wasn't my brother?<br> Don't want to blow chances for romance<br> by smelling of dung at the reception.<br> Oh, God. I never know what to<br> say in these wretched lineups.<br> It's a cinch. Give a big, warm<br> hug and say the bride looks pregnant.<br> Or stick with tradition,<br> "You must be very proud."<br> Heaven preserve us.<br> You must be very proud.<br> Thank you.<br> Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hi, we've met. It's Richard Maples.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Bastard.<br> - Hello, Bern.<br> - Hello, Chuck.<br> Two, please.<br> - You have fun, now.<br> - Take care.<br> Oh, hello.<br> Hi.<br> - You want one of these?<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - I...<br> - Hello, Charles.<br> Hello, dear John. How are you?<br> Good. This is...<br> Carrie.<br> - Delighted. I'm John.<br> - Hi, John.<br> How's your girlfriend?<br> She's no longer my girlfriend.<br> Don't be too gloomy. Rumor is she<br> never stopped bonking Toby de Lisle.<br> She's now my wife.<br> Excellent.<br> Excellent. Congratulations.<br> Excuse me.<br> Any kids or anything, John?<br> Do we hear the patter of tiny...<br> ...feet?<br> No.<br> Well, there's plenty of time for<br> that, isn't there? No hurry.<br> Hi. How are you?<br> My name's Fiona.<br> I'm Gerald.<br> What do you do?<br> I'm training to be a priest.<br> Good lord!<br> Do you do weddings?<br> No. No, not yet.<br> I will, though, of course.<br> Jolly nerve-racking.<br> Yes, rather like the first time<br> one has sex.<br> Well, I suppose so.<br> Rather less messy, of course.<br> And far less call for condoms.<br> Who's that boy<br> over there in the gray?<br> His name's David.<br> Something of a dish, isn't he?<br> Well, I've always thought so.<br> Why are they?<br> - The dish can't hear.<br> - Oh!<br> Gosh.<br> Yeah, silent...<br> ...but deadly attractive.<br> Bang, bang, bang. That's it.<br> Into the marquee, please.<br> Dinner is served.<br> How do you do?<br> Hello, Tom. Splendid to meet you.<br> Very exciting.<br> Hi.<br> My name's Scarlett.<br> Don't let me drink too much,<br> because I'll get really flirty.<br> How do you do? My name is Charles.<br> Don't be ridiculous.<br> Charles died 20 years ago.<br> Must be a different Charles.<br> You're saying I don't know<br> my own brother?<br> No, no.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to<br> drag you from your desserts.<br> There are one or two little things<br> I feel I should say as best man.<br> This is only the second time<br> I've ever been best man.<br> I hope I did the job okay<br> that time.<br> The couple in question are at least<br> still talking to me.<br> Unfortunately, they're not actually<br> talking to each other.<br> The divorce came through<br> a couple of months ago.<br> But I'm assured it had absolutely<br> nothing to do with me.<br> Apparently, Paula knew Pierce slept<br> with her sister...<br> ...before I mentioned it<br> in the speech.<br> The fact that he slept with her<br> mother came as a surprise...<br> ...but I think was incidental to<br> the nightmare of recrimination...<br> ...and violence that became<br> their two-day marriage.<br> Anyway, enough of that. My job<br> today is to talk about Angus.<br> And there are no skeletons<br> in his cupboard...<br> ...or so I thought.<br> I'll get to that in a minute.<br> I'd just like to say this:<br> I am as ever...<br> ...in bewildered awe of anyone<br> who makes this kind of commitment...<br> ...that Angus and Laura<br> have made today.<br> I know I couldn't do it...<br> ...and I think it's wonderful<br> they can.<br> So back to Angus and those sheep.<br> So, ladies and gentlemen,<br> if you'd raise your glasses.<br> - The adorable couple.<br> - Yes!<br> The adorable couple!<br> The adorable couple!<br> Get one for me, Angus!<br> The first time I saw<br> Gareth on the dance floor...<br> ...I feared lives would be lost.<br> She's a pretty girl.<br> The one you can't take your eyes off.<br> Love at first sight?<br> No, it's the bloke she's dancing with.<br> I played rugby with him at school.<br> I'm trying to remember what<br> position he played.<br> Though, let's say for<br> the sake of argument...<br> ...one did take a fancy to someone<br> at a wedding.<br> Do you think there are people<br> who can just say:<br> "Hi, babe. My name's Charles.<br> This is your lucky night"?<br> If there are, they're not English.<br> Quite.<br> Three weeks is about<br> my question-popping minimum.<br> You know I love you,<br> Jean, don't you?<br> I love you.<br> I love you.<br> And Mike, I've never met you before...<br> ...but I love you very much.<br> I really do.<br> Ignore her, she's drunk.<br> At least I hope she is.<br> Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.<br> How's it going, Lyds?<br> Bloody awful.<br> Oh, dear. What's the problem?<br> I was promised sex.<br> Everybody said it:<br> "You'll be a bridesmaid, you'll get<br> sex. You'll be fighting them off."<br> But not so much as a tongue in sight.<br> Well, I mean, if you fancy...<br> ...anything.<br> I could always...<br> Oh, don't be ridiculous, Bernard.<br> - I'm not that desperate.<br> - No, right. Of course.<br> Fair enough.<br> It's a good point.<br> Bye!<br> Have a lovely, lovely time!<br> Bye!<br> Where are you staying tonight,<br> Charles?<br> Scarlett and I are at some pub.<br> The Lucky Boat, something like that.<br> Aren't we all?<br> No. Slight change of plan.<br> The others are coming<br> back to my place.<br> Nansy's there. Might cook us eggs and<br> back over a late-night Scrabble.<br> Wondered if you'd like to join.<br> Yeah, great. Thanks very much.<br> Is there room for Scarlett?<br> Oh, absolutely.<br> Tommy, are you the richest man<br> in England?<br> No, no!<br> I believe we're about seventh.<br> The queen, obviously.<br> And that Branson bloke's<br> doing terribly well.<br> Well, excellent news.<br> I'll go tell Scarlett.<br> Yeah.<br> That's...<br> ...unless you get lucky first.<br> Forget about it! Get out of it!<br> Get out. Go on!<br> Hi.<br> Hi. Hi! I thought you'd gone.<br> Not yet. I was just wondering<br> where you were staying tonight.<br> Well...<br> I was staying at some pub called<br> The Lucky...<br> ...Boat or something like that.<br> - Boatman.<br> Right.<br> But now I'm going to stay at some<br> friend's house with some friends.<br> Well, I think enormous castle is<br> a more accurate description.<br> That's too bad because<br> I'm at The Boatman.<br> Well, it was nice...<br> ...not quite meeting you.<br> It was a great speech.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, I'm going now.<br> No! No, no, don't go.<br> We can meet now.<br> The evening's just getting going.<br> We both know that's a big lie.<br> Fuck.<br> The castle beckons, I think, Tom.<br> Are you sober?<br> Absolutely. Orange juice all night.<br> Come on.<br> Bye, everybody!<br> Bernard!<br> Stand by your man<br> Wah, wah, wah, wah<br> And tell the world<br> You love him<br> And give him<br> All the love you can<br> Stand by...<br> Tom, can you stop the car?<br> Stop the car!<br> Sorry. Sorry.<br> I just think I might...<br> ...stay in that pub after all.<br> Why on earth?<br> No, seriously. I'm researching<br> pubs with "boat" in the title.<br> I hope to produce the definitive work.<br> - Please yourself.<br> - It's a silly thing, you know?<br> Right.<br> Odd decision.<br> Hello.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Turned out there wasn't<br> room for all of us.<br> You said it was a castle.<br> No, it is a castle.<br> It's just a very, very small one.<br> Tiny. Just one up,<br> one down, which is rare.<br> Drink, sir?<br> Yeah. I'd like a glass<br> of whiskey, please. Thanks.<br> - Do you want?<br> - Yeah, sounds good.<br> - Make another one for the lady.<br> - Doubles, sir?<br> Thanks.<br> You here too? How are you?<br> Hello. I'm fine.<br> - Haven't seen Carrie, have you?<br> - Who?<br> Carrie. American girl.<br> Lovely legs.<br> Wedding guest. Nice smell.<br> No. Sorry.<br> Damn. Blast.<br> I think I was in there.<br> If you see her, could you<br> tell her I've gone to my room?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> - Your whiskey, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> And one for the...<br> Road. Lovely.<br> I think I might have one.<br> Mind if I join you?<br> No. It'd be lovely.<br> Another glass of whiskey<br> and a cigar.<br> Hold on. Make that a bottle.<br> We might as well settle in. Let's<br> see if we can push on till dawn.<br> - Lovely wedding.<br> - Yes, yes.<br> I was at school with his brother<br> Bufty. Tremendous bloke.<br> He was head of my house.<br> Buggered me senseless.<br> Taught me things about life.<br> Where you know him from?<br> University.<br> Splendid. Splendid. Yep.<br> I didn't go myself.<br> I couldn't see the point.<br> When you're working the money markets<br> what use is Wordsworth gonna be?<br> Excuse me. Your wife says,<br> "Could you come upstairs at once?"<br> Room 12, in case you can't remember.<br> - My wife?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Oh, my wife! My wife!<br> You are drunk. You can't<br> remember you got a wife.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> - Do you mind if I?<br> - No, no. Off you go.<br> - Best of luck.<br> - Thanks.<br> Lucky bachelor me, I'll have another<br> search for that Katie creature.<br> - Carrie.<br> - That's the one. Damn fine filly.<br> I think I'm in there.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hello.<br> Sorry about that.<br> That's fine.<br> He was hard to get rid of.<br> Yeah.<br> So...<br> Maybe we could just...<br> ...skulk around here<br> for a bit, and then...<br> ...go back down.<br> Now that's a thought.<br> I don't usually skulk a lot...<br> ...but I suppose I could skulk if<br> skulking were required.<br> Do you skulk regularly?<br> No. No, I don't normally...<br> ...think of myself as a skulker,<br> but...<br> Well, why don't you come in<br> and skulk for a while...<br> ...and we'll see.<br> I noticed the bride and groom<br> didn't kiss in the church...<br> ...which is kind of strange.<br> Where I come from, kissing is<br> very big.<br> Is it? Yes, well, you're right.<br> We probably are more reserved.<br> "You may now kiss the bride," isn't<br> in the book of common prayer.<br> I always worry I'll go too far<br> in the heat of the moment.<br> How far do you think<br> too far would be, then?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Maybe...<br> That would be all right.<br> That would be fine.<br> In fact, it might be<br> a bit dismissive.<br> Maybe this...<br> ...would be better.<br> Yeah, I think it would be dangerous<br> to take it any further.<br> I mean...<br> You know...<br> That might be taking it<br> a little far.<br> What about this?<br> You think the vicar would think things<br> had slipped a bit out of his control?<br> I think he might.<br> This kind of thing is really<br> better suited...<br> ...to the honeymoon than<br> to the service itself.<br> Why do you think<br> it's called a honeymoon?<br> I don't know. I suppose it's...<br> ..."honey" because it's sweet<br> as honey.<br> And "moon" because it was<br> the first time...<br> ...a husband got to see<br> his wife's bottom.<br> What's happening?<br> I have to go.<br> - Where?<br> - America.<br> That is a tragedy.<br> Just before I go...<br> ...when were you thinking of<br> announcing the engagement?<br> Sorry. Whose engagement?<br> Ours.<br> I assumed since we slept together,<br> we'd be getting married.<br> What did you think?<br> What?<br> I...<br> Gosh, you know, that...<br> ...takes a lot of thinking about,<br> that kind of thing.<br> Obviously, I'm...<br> You're joking.<br> God! For a moment there, I thought<br> I was in Fatal Attraction.<br> I thought you were Glenn Close and I'd<br> find my pet rabbit on the stove.<br> No.<br> But I think we've both missed<br> a great opportunity here.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, fuck!<br> Fuck.<br> Fuck.<br> Fuckity, fuck.<br> Fuck. Fuck!<br> - Car or taxi?<br> - Taxi. We could never park.<br> Car seems a good idea.<br> - Fuck.<br> - Fuck.<br> Leave it. No one will notice.<br> Well...<br> ...sorry I'm late. Traffic.<br> Yeah.<br> Who is it today?<br> One more, please.<br> They're ready to go.<br> In the name of the Father...<br> ...and of the Son...<br> ...and of the Holy Spirit.<br> Amen.<br> Let us pray.<br> Father, you have made the bond of<br> marriage a holy mystery...<br> ...a symbol of Christ's love<br> for His church.<br> Hear our prayers for<br> Bernard and Lydia...<br> ...through your son, Jesus Christ<br> our lord...<br> ...who lives and reigns with you...<br> ...and the Holy goat.<br> Ghost.<br> One God, forever and ever. Amen.<br> It's his first time.<br> He's a friend of the family.<br> - Excellent.<br> - Bernard and Lydia...<br> ...I shall now ask if you freely<br> undertake the obligations of marriage.<br> Bernard, repeat after me:<br> I do solemnly declare...<br> I do solemnly declare...<br> ...that I know not of<br> any lawful impediment...<br> ...that I know not of any<br> lawful impediment...<br> ...why I, Lydia...<br> ...why I, Bernard...<br> Sorry.<br> Why I...<br> ...Bernard Godfrey<br> Saint John Delaney...<br> Why I, Bernard Geoffrey<br> "St. John" Delaney...<br> ...may not be joined<br> in matrimony...<br> ...to Lydia John Hibbott.<br> ...may not be joined<br> in matrimony...<br> ...to Lydia Jane Hibbott.<br> Lydia...<br> ...repeat after me:<br> I do solemnly declare...<br> I do solemnly declare...<br> ...that I know not of any<br> lawful impediment...<br> ...that I know not of any<br> lawful impediment...<br> ...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott...<br> ...why I, Lydia Jane Hibbott...<br> ...may not be joined in matrimony...<br> ...may not be joined in matrimony...<br> ...to Bernard Geoffrey...<br> ..."St. John" Delaney.<br> ...to Bernard...<br> ...Geoffrey...<br> ...St. John Delaney.<br> I call upon those persons here<br> present to witness...<br> I call upon those persons here<br> present to witness...<br> ...that I, Bernard...<br> ...Delaney...<br> ...that I, Bernard Delaney...<br> ...do take thee,<br> Lydia Jane Hibbott...<br> ...do take thee,<br> Lydia Jane Hibbott...<br> ...to be my awful wedded wife.<br> ...to be my lawful wedded wife.<br> That's r... That's right.<br> May almighty God bless you all.<br> The Father, the Son and the<br> Holy spigot... Spirit.<br> Amen.<br> Bravo!<br> Bravo!<br> Bravo!<br> Thanks.<br> - We're coming, Bernie.<br> - Up here!<br> Sorry.<br> Sorry. Sorry.<br> That way? Yes, of course.<br> - Sorry. Could you two...<br> - Tom, don't go away.<br> Sorry.<br> I've got a new theory<br> about marriage.<br> Two people are in love, they live<br> together, and then suddenly...<br> ...one day they run out<br> of conversation.<br> Totally. They can't think of<br> a single thing to say to each other.<br> That's it. Panic.<br> Then suddenly...<br> ...it occurs to the chap that there is<br> a way out of the deadlock.<br> - Which is?<br> - He'll ask her to marry him.<br> Brilliant. Brilliant!<br> They've got something to talk about<br> for the rest of their lives.<br> You're saying marriage is a way<br> to get out of a pause in conversation.<br> The definitive icebreaker.<br> Tom, how's the speech coming along?<br> It's pretty good, I think.<br> Something for everyone.<br> Tears, laughter.<br> Excellent.<br> I think it's a very good<br> theory, Gareth.<br> There is another argument that it<br> has something to do with true love.<br> Now there's a thought.<br> Can I help you, sir?<br> Can I have three glasses<br> of brandy, please?<br> Hi.<br> Hello.<br> How are you?<br> Fine. Fine.<br> Yeah. Sorry, I'm overwhelmed<br> to see you.<br> Look, don't go back<br> to America. Please.<br> - Be back in two secs, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> Hi, Fi.<br> That's yours and yours.<br> See you in 5 hours.<br> - Something happened?<br> - Yes. This is a bloody great wedding.<br> Hi.<br> Well, you look perfect. In fact,<br> you probably are perfect.<br> - Well, how are you?<br> - I'm really well.<br> Charles, I'd like you<br> to meet Hamish, my fiance.<br> Excellent.<br> Excellent.<br> How do you do, Hamish?<br> Delighted to meet you.<br> Charming to find Carrie back here.<br> It took lots of persuading.<br> Come on, darling, I told James<br> I was getting you.<br> He'll think I've totally lost<br> control over you already.<br> I'll see you later.<br> How are you doing, Charles?<br> Not great, actually, suddenly.<br> I don't know.<br> I mean...<br> What the hell's going on here?<br> Why am I always at weddings...<br> ...and never actually<br> getting married, Matt?<br> It's probably because<br> you're a bit scruffy.<br> Yeah.<br> Or it could also be because you<br> haven't met the right girl.<br> But you see, is that it?<br> Maybe I have met the right girls.<br> Maybe I meet them all the time.<br> - Maybe it's me.<br> - Oh, nonsense.<br> My lords, ladies, and gentlemen:<br> Dinner is served.<br> Come on. Odds on you meet<br> your wife at dinner.<br> Yes.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Charles?<br> Hi.<br> - Hello, I'm Alistair.<br> - Great.<br> And I believe you know Veronica.<br> Yeah. Hi, V.<br> Nicki.<br> Great.<br> Tell me, are you married?<br> No.<br> Are you a lesbian?<br> Good lord!<br> Well, what made you say that?<br> It's one of the possibilities for<br> unmarried girls.<br> It's a bit more<br> interesting than saying:<br> "Oh, dear. Just never found<br> the right chap."<br> Quite right.<br> Why be dull?<br> Thank you.<br> The truth is, I have met the right<br> person, only he's not in love with me.<br> Until I stop loving him,<br> no one stands a chance.<br> Bad luck.<br> Yes, isn't it?<br> I was a lesbian once at school...<br> ...but only for 15 minutes.<br> I don't think it counts.<br> There are 400 different<br> kinds of tea...<br> ...and that's not including all these<br> so-called fruit teas.<br> I took Veronica to India to<br> look at the plantations.<br> Excellent.<br> I believe you and her<br> went there once.<br> That's right.<br> Charles was vile.<br> He insisted on cracking jokes<br> while I was ill.<br> I was cheering you up.<br> You're that Veronica!<br> Which Veronica?<br> Charlie?<br> Remember Bombay?<br> When Charles and I were going out,<br> he told me he'd had...<br> ...this interesting journey<br> around India...<br> ...with Vomiting Veronica.<br> I think that was it.<br> I don't remember ever mentioning it.<br> Maybe I did.<br> Oh, come on, Charles.<br> I don't think I've been out<br> with anyone less discreet.<br> That's a bit of an exaggeration.<br> It is not.<br> I remember you going on<br> about this girl. Helena was it?<br> Her mother made a pass at you.<br> I remember this!<br> You couldn't work out if it would be<br> impolite not to accept her advances!<br> That's right!<br> Helena was Miss Piggy,<br> so her mother was Mrs. Piggy.<br> I think perhaps it was...<br> We've both lost a lot of weight<br> since then.<br> Ah, great. The speeches.<br> My lords, ladies, and gentlemen...<br> ...pray silence for the best man.<br> When Bernard told me he was<br> getting engaged to Lydia...<br> ...I congratulated him, because<br> all his other girlfriends...<br> ...had been such complete dogs.<br> May I say we are delighted to have<br> so many of them here this evening.<br> I'm particularly delighted<br> to see Camilla...<br> ...who many of you<br> will probably remember...<br> ...as the first person<br> Bernard asked to marry him.<br> If I remember rightly,<br> she told him to sod off.<br> And lucky for Lydia that she did.<br> It's very disappointing.<br> We had the most adorable girl<br> at our table called Carrie.<br> Apparently her fiance's awfully<br> grand and he owns half of Scotland.<br> - How are you?<br> - I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.<br> Ghosts of girlfriends<br> past at every turn.<br> If I see Henrietta,<br> the horror will be complete.<br> Hello, Charles.<br> Hello, Hen. How are you?<br> Oh, Hen, I...<br> Why can't you leave her alone?<br> Haven't you hurt her enough?<br> Excuse me. I think I'd better be<br> where other people are not.<br> Hello.<br> Taxi!<br> Good night, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> I know. It's all right.<br> Oh, God, this is wonderful.<br> Please.<br> Oh, wait a minute. This is no fun.<br> I want to see my lovely husband!<br> Who's a very bad bridegroom,<br> indeed?!<br> - Have you got a boyfriend?<br> - Yes.<br> - What's his name?<br> - Dolph. He's good at table tennis.<br> What about you?<br> No. Afraid not.<br> Why not?<br> I don't know.<br> Because most of the blokes I fancy...<br> ...think I'm stupid and pointless...<br> ...and so they just bonk me<br> and then leave me.<br> And the kind of blokes that do<br> fancy me, I think are drips.<br> I can't even be bothered<br> to bonk them...<br> ...which does sort of<br> leave me a bit nowhere.<br> What's bonking?<br> Well, it's kind of like<br> table tennis...<br> ...only with slightly<br> smaller balls.<br> So good!<br> I love my wife!<br> And I love my husband!<br> Think we'd better be<br> getting back?<br> Or we could just wait a few minutes<br> and have another go.<br> Naughty...<br> ...naughty little rabbit.<br> Found it.<br> Charles. Charles, we must talk.<br> Right. You're right.<br> The thing is, Charlie, I've spoken<br> to lots of people about you.<br> And everybody agrees<br> you're in real trouble, Charles.<br> Am I?<br> You see, you're turning into<br> a serial monogamist.<br> One girl after another, yet you'll<br> never love anyone...<br> ...because you never let<br> them near you.<br> On the contrary, Hen...<br> You're affectionate to them<br> and sweet to them.<br> Even to me, although you thought<br> I was an idiot.<br> - I did not.<br> - You did.<br> I thought U2 was a type of submarine.<br> Well, their music<br> has a naval quality.<br> Be serious, Charles. You must<br> give people a chance.<br> You don't have to think,<br> "I must get married."<br> But you mustn't start relationships<br> thinking, "I mustn't get married."<br> Most of the time I don't think at all.<br> I just potter along.<br> Oh, Charlie!<br> Oh, God, the way you used<br> to look at me!<br> I just misread it, that's all.<br> I thought you were going to propose<br> and you were working out how to leave.<br> No, no. I wasn't.<br> Oh, God. This is ridiculous.<br> - Hen...<br> - No.<br> No, Hen! Hen!<br> No!<br> Having a good night?<br> Yes, yes.<br> It's right up there with my father's<br> funeral for sheer entertainment value.<br> I thought you'd gone.<br> No. Hamish has to take<br> the Edinburgh sleeper.<br> I'm off now. Keep me company?<br> Here, please.<br> You want to come up<br> for a nightcap?<br> You sure?<br> Yes. I think we can risk it.<br> I'm pretty sure I can resist you.<br> You're not that cute.<br> Sorry. Yeah, great.<br> Morning, Charles.<br> Breakfast's up.<br> Well, it's a bit burnt.<br> Excellent.<br> What are you up to today?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I'm taking advantage of the fact that<br> for the first time in my life...<br> ...it's Saturday and I don't have a<br> wedding to go to.<br> All I have to do<br> is not be late for David.<br> I'm gonna go for a job.<br> A shop called Spank<br> wants a sales assistant.<br> I think I'd be great.<br> They sell all this funny<br> rubber stuff.<br> Oh, no.<br> Another wedding invitation...<br> ...and a list. Lovely.<br> Well, they say rubber's<br> mainly for perverts.<br> I don't know why. It's<br> very practical, actually.<br> You spill anything on it,<br> and it just comes off.<br> I suppose that could be why<br> the perverts like it.<br> You all right?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> It's that girl, Carrie.<br> You remember...<br> ...the American.<br> Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.<br> Do you have the wedding list<br> for Banks?<br> Certainly, sir.<br> Lots of beautiful things for around<br> about the 1000 mark.<br> What about, things around the sort of<br> 50 mark? Is there much?<br> Well, you could get<br> that pygmy warrior over there.<br> This? Excellent.<br> If you could find someone to chip in<br> the other 3950.<br> Or our carrier bags<br> are 1.50 each.<br> Why don't you just get<br> Yes, well, I think<br> I'll probably leave it.<br> Thanks very much.<br> You've been very...<br> What'd you get?<br> Blimey!<br> Well, I never.<br> Nothing yet. I'm just,<br> you know, deciding.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> This present thing is great.<br> I should've gotten married years ago.<br> Did anybody go for the pygmy?<br> The young man was thinking about it.<br> Oh, no!<br> Just get me an ashtray.<br> Are you free for about a half-hour?<br> Yeah. I'm supposed to meet my<br> brother, but I can be a bit late.<br> Good, come with me. You have<br> an important decision to make.<br> It's crucial that you mustn't laugh.<br> Okay, right.<br> What do you think?<br> Divine.<br> Bit of a meringue?<br> Oh, don't worry.<br> We've only just begun.<br> What do you think?<br> You're kidding.<br> It would be wonderful, wouldn't it?<br> Maybe next time.<br> What do you think?<br> I knew it.<br> But with a staff, you<br> could mind sheep.<br> Don't be rude.<br> It's a bit sexy, this.<br> Well...<br> ...if I were your husband,<br> I would die of pride.<br> You're right. It is dangerous.<br> There's nothing more off-putting than<br> a priest with an enormous erection.<br> One strange thing is thinking you'll<br> never sleep with anyone else.<br> You don't think<br> you'll be unfaithful?<br> No. Not once I'm married.<br> I told Hamish I'll kill him if he<br> does, so I better stick to that.<br> Quite right.<br> Anyway, I reckon I've had<br> my fair run at it.<br> What is a fair run these days<br> down your way?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> More than one.<br> Well, come on.<br> Tell me.<br> I've seen the dress.<br> We have no secrets now.<br> Well...<br> The first one...<br> ...of course not easily forgotten,<br> was kind of nice.<br> Two: Hairy back.<br> Three, four, five...<br> Six was on my birthday<br> in my parents' room.<br> - Which birthday?<br> - 17th.<br> We've only reached 17?<br> I grew up in the country. Lots of<br> rolling around in haystacks.<br> Okay, seven.<br> Eight, unfortunately, was<br> quite a shock.<br> Nine: Against a fence.<br> Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.<br> I won't.<br> Ten was gorgeous.<br> Just heaven, just...<br> Wonderful.<br> I hate him.<br> Eleven: Obviously, after 10,<br> disappointing.<br> Twelve through 17:<br> The university years.<br> Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.<br> Sexually speaking, a real low patch.<br> Eighteen broke my heart.<br> Years of yearning.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Twenty: Oh, my God, I can't<br> believe I've reached 20.<br> Twenty-one: Elephant tongue.<br> Twenty-two kept falling asleep.<br> That was my first year in England.<br> I do apologize.<br> Twenty-three and 24 together.<br> - That was something.<br> - Seriously?<br> Twenty-seven:<br> Now that was a mistake.<br> Suddenly, at 27,<br> you make a mistake?<br> Well, yes, he kept screaming.<br> It was very off-putting. I nearly<br> gave up on the whole thing.<br> But Spencer changed my mind.<br> That's 28.<br> His father, 29.<br> His father?<br> Thirty...<br> Thirty-one, oh, my God.<br> Thirty-two was lovely.<br> And then my fiance. That's 33.<br> Wow!<br> So I came after your fiance?<br> No, you were 32.<br> So there you go.<br> Less than Madonna, more than<br> Princess Di, I hope.<br> And you? How many have<br> you slept with?<br> Christ. Nothing like that many.<br> I don't know what the fuck I've been<br> doing with my time, actually.<br> Work, yeah, that's it, work.<br> I have been working late a lot.<br> I wish I'd rung you...<br> ...but then you never rang me.<br> You ruthlessly slept with me twice<br> and never rang me.<br> Oh, bollocks!<br> Help me, please. Please.<br> Carrie, this is David, my brother.<br> Hi.<br> I was just telling him about<br> you marrying Hamish...<br> ...and he said it couldn't have<br> happened to a nicer fellow.<br> - Where are you doing it?<br> - Scotland.<br> He says that's a beautiful place.<br> Hilly.<br> You should come to the wedding too.<br> I want many friends there to make<br> up for the stiffs that Hamish knows.<br> Well, you better go in.<br> Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Fuck it.<br> Look.<br> Sorry, sorry.<br> I just, well...<br> This is a really stupid question...<br> ...particularly in view of our recent<br> shopping excursion.<br> But, I just wondered<br> if by any chance...<br> Obviously not, because I'm a git<br> who's only slept with nine people.<br> But I just wondered...<br> I really feel...<br> In short, to recap in a slightly<br> clearer version...<br> ...in the words of David Cassidy,<br> in fact...<br> ...while he was with<br> The Partridge Family...<br> ...I think I love you.<br> I just wondered whether by any chance<br> you wouldn't like to...<br> No, no, no. Of course not.<br> I'm an idiot, he's not.<br> Excellent. Excellent. Fantastic.<br> Lovely to see you. Sorry to<br> disturb. Better get on.<br> Fuck!<br> That was very romantic.<br> Well, I thought it over a lot.<br> I wanted to get it just right.<br> Important to have said it, I think.<br> Said what, exactly?<br> Said...<br> ...you know, what I just said about...<br> ...David Cassidy.<br> You're lovely.<br> It was ordained for lifelong faithful<br> relationship of conjugal love.<br> It was ordained for the welfare<br> of human society...<br> ... which can be strong and happy...<br> ... only when the marriage bond<br> is held in honor.<br> Into this holy estate...<br> ...these two persons now desire<br> to enter.<br> Wherefore if anyone can show<br> any just cause...<br> ...why they may not lawfully be<br> joined together in marriage...<br> ...let him now declare it.<br> Sorry.<br> Please rise.<br> Do you, Hamish...<br> ...take this woman, Caroline,<br> to be your wedded wife?<br> And do you, in the presence of God<br> and before this congregation...<br> ...promise and covenant to be to her,<br> a loving and faithful husband...<br> ...until God shall<br> separate you by death?<br> I do.<br> Do you, Caroline...<br> ...take this man, Hamish,<br> to be your wedded husband?<br> And do you, in the presence of God<br> and before this congregation...<br> ...promise and covenant to be to him<br> a loving and faithful wife...<br> ...until God shall separate you<br> by death?<br> I do.<br> Fuck-a-doodle-doo.<br> - Awfully nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> How do you do?<br> Hello.<br> You look beautiful.<br> - Not a meringue in sight.<br> - Thanks.<br> Blimey.<br> It's Brigadoon.<br> It's bloody Brigadoon!<br> Dear old things, as you know...<br> ...I've always been proud there isn't<br> a wedding ring between the lot of us.<br> Over the passing of years, it's<br> suddenly beginning to distress me.<br> I'd like to go to the wedding of<br> someone I really loved, for a change.<br> Don't blame me. I've asked<br> practically everyone I know.<br> You haven't ask me.<br> - Haven't I?<br> - No.<br> Oh, Scarlett.<br> Would you like to?<br> No, thank you. It was very nice<br> of you to ask.<br> Well, anytime.<br> Quite right, Tom. That's the spirit.<br> Tonight, these are your orders:<br> Go forth and conjugate.<br> Find husbands and wives.<br> Excellent plan.<br> What do you think, Fifi?<br> Spot a potential hubby<br> in the throng?<br> - Bugger off, Tom.<br> - Quite right.<br> A toast before we go<br> into battle.<br> To true love.<br> In whatever shape<br> or form it may come.<br> May we all in our dotage<br> be proud to say:<br> "I was adored once too."<br> - True love.<br> - True love!<br> Apparently, an enormous number<br> of people...<br> ...actually bump into their future<br> spouses at weddings.<br> Which is interesting.<br> Yes, I met my husband<br> at a wedding.<br> Good lord, I seem to have finished<br> my drink. If you'll excuse me.<br> Hello. My name's Scarlett.<br> Named after Scarlett O'Hara,<br> but much less trouble.<br> What's your name?<br> My name's Rhett.<br> No.<br> Not really!<br> No, not really.<br> In fact, it's Chester.<br> You kidder.<br> I always imagine Americans are going<br> to be dull as shit.<br> I mean, of course<br> you're not, are you?<br> Steve Martin's American, isn't he?<br> Yes, he is.<br> You're lovely.<br> Come on!<br> Hello, Charles.<br> Oh, Hen. Hi.<br> I'm sorry. I couldn't<br> really bear a scene today.<br> I know we probably<br> got tons to talk about.<br> Did I behave that atrociously<br> last time?<br> - Remember the shower scene in Psycho?<br> - Yeah.<br> Scarier.<br> Oh, God, I'm depressed, Hen.<br> How are you?<br> I'm cheerful, actually.<br> I weigh almost nothing.<br> And I've got a divine new boyfriend.<br> - Perhaps we should've married.<br> - Good God, no.<br> I'd have had to marry your friends.<br> I'm not quite sure I could take Fiona.<br> Fiona loves you.<br> Fiona calls me duckface.<br> Well, I never heard that.<br> Look, darling, come to lunch soon.<br> Give me a ring, okay? Oh, still cute!<br> How's duckface?<br> Good form, actually. Not too mad.<br> Ladies and gentlemen:<br> The bride and groom.<br> You like this girl, don't you?<br> Yes.<br> Yes, it's a...<br> It was a strange thing<br> when at last it happens.<br> And...<br> ...she's marrying someone else.<br> How about you, Fifi?<br> You identified a future partner<br> for life yet?<br> No need, really.<br> The deed is done.<br> I've been in love with<br> the same bloke for ages.<br> Have you?<br> Who's that?<br> You, Charlie.<br> It's always been you.<br> Since first we met...<br> ...oh so many years ago.<br> I knew the first moment.<br> Across a crowded room.<br> Or lawn, in fact.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> There's nothing either of us can do.<br> Such is life.<br> Friends isn't...<br> ...bad, you know? Friends is<br> quite something.<br> Oh, Fi.<br> It's not all easy, is it?<br> No.<br> Just forget this business.<br> Not to be.<br> Matthew, darling.<br> Where's Gareth?<br> Torturing Americans.<br> How thoughtful of him.<br> Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?<br> Not personally, no.<br> But I do know someone who could get<br> his fax number for you.<br> Shall we dance?<br> Well, any rings on fingers?<br> Oh, Gareth, you don't know<br> how lucky you are.<br> Finding someone to marry is<br> a very tricky business.<br> It's hell out there. Matthew's<br> trapped with a Minnesotan evangelist.<br> Come down, sweet Jesus,<br> and cast out the devil!<br> My lords, ladies, and gentlemen...<br> ...please charge your glasses.<br> First, and rather unusually,<br> we have the bride.<br> Excellent. I love this girl.<br> Thank you.<br> I'd like to thank all of you<br> who flew in from the States.<br> I'm really touched.<br> For you others, I'd have thought lots<br> of frightful Americans flying in...<br> ...was an excuse for staying away,<br> so I thank you too.<br> If my darling dad<br> had been here today...<br> ...he would have been speaking now.<br> I know he would have said:<br> "Great dress, babe...<br> ...but why in the hell are you<br> marrying the stiff in the skirt?"<br> And I would have given him<br> the same answer that I give you:<br> "Because I love him."<br> As John Lennon said, who died<br> the same year as my dad:<br> "Love is the answer.<br> And you know that for sure."<br> One more thing:<br> Someone told me here, that if<br> things with Hamish didn't work out...<br> ...that he'd step in. So thanks,<br> and I'll keep you posted.<br> Bravo!<br> And now, my lords, ladies<br> and gentlemen: Sir Hamish Banks.<br> Anyone involved in politics<br> for the last 20 years...<br> ...has gotten used to being upstaged<br> by a woman.<br> I didn't expect it to happen to<br> me on my wedding day.<br> However, I must also say...<br> ...that I'm quite happy<br> to be upstaged by this woman...<br> ...for the rest of my life.<br> Some barracking at the back again?<br> Something we politicians are used to.<br> - Shit. Find a doctor.<br> - Right. Okay.<br> First, I want to extend my<br> compliments to the bridesmaids.<br> You did your duty superbly.<br> I intend to use you every time<br> I get married from now on.<br> I want to thank all those wonderful<br> ladies of the parish...<br> ...who did the flowers in the church.<br> The stern old building took on<br> a look of flushing youth today.<br> I remember the first time<br> I laid eyes on Caroline.<br> I thought to myself, "If by any chance<br> she's shortsighted...<br> ...I might just be happy<br> for the rest of my life."<br> I thought I could see my future<br> for the first time.<br> It was a joyful one...<br> ...for years and years to come.<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For they are jolly good fellows<br> For they are jolly good fellows<br> And so say all of us<br> Good morning, and a warm welcome<br> to you all on this cold day.<br> Our service will begin<br> in a few minutes.<br> But first we have asked Matthew...<br> ...Gareth's closest friend,<br> to say a few words.<br> Gareth used to prefer<br> funerals to weddings.<br> He said it was easier to get<br> enthusiastic about a ceremony...<br> ...one had an outside chance of<br> eventually being involved in.<br> In order to prepare this speech, I rang<br> people to get a general picture...<br> ...of how Gareth was regarded<br> by those who met him.<br> "Fat" seems to have been a word<br> people most connected with him.<br> "Terribly rude" also rang<br> a lot of bells.<br> "So very fat and very rude" seems to<br> have been the stranger's viewpoint.<br> On the other hand, some of you have<br> rung me to say that you loved him...<br> ...which I know he would have been<br> thrilled to hear.<br> You remember his fabulous<br> hospitality.<br> His strange experimental cooking.<br> The recipe for duck la banana...<br> ...fortunately goes with him<br> to his grave.<br> Most of all...<br> ...you tell me of his enormous<br> capacity for joy.<br> And when joyful...<br> When joyful, for highly vocal<br> drunkenness.<br> But I hope joyful is how<br> you will remember him.<br> Not stuck in a box in a church.<br> Pick your favorite of his waistcoats<br> and remember him that way.<br> The most splendid...<br> ...replete...<br> ...big-hearted...<br> Weak-hearted, as it turned out.<br> - And jolly bugger<br> most of us ever met.<br> As for me, you may ask<br> how I will remember him.<br> What I thought of him.<br> Unfortunately, there<br> I run out of words.<br> Forgive me if I turn from<br> my own feelings...<br> ...to the words of another<br> splendid bugger:<br> W.H. Auden.<br> This is actually what I want to say:<br> "Stop all the clocks.<br> Cut off the telephone.<br> Prevent the dog from barking<br> with a juicy bone.<br> Silence the pianos,<br> and with muffled drum...<br> ...bring out the coffin.<br> Let the mourners come.<br> Let the airplanes circle,<br> moaning overhead...<br> ...scribbling on the sky the message:<br> He is dead.<br> Put great bows around the white necks<br> of the public doves.<br> Let traffic policemen<br> wear black cotton gloves.<br> He was my north, my south,<br> my east and west.<br> My working week and my Sunday rest.<br> My noon, my midnight,<br> my talk, my song.<br> I thought that love<br> would last forever...<br> ...I was wrong.<br> The stars are not wanted now...<br> ... put out every one.<br> Pack up the moon<br> and dismantle the sun.<br> Pour away the ocean<br> and sweep up the wood.<br> For nothing now can ever<br> come to any good."<br> Bye, now.<br> I'll take you home, Scarlett.<br> It's good of you to come.<br> Must have been the shortest<br> honeymoon in history.<br> No, it's fine.<br> We'll do it some other time.<br> That thing you said in the street?<br> Yes. I'm sorry about that.<br> No, I liked it.<br> I liked you saying it.<br> Charlie, I'll take Scarlett<br> home, all right?<br> Yeah.<br> Darling Fi.<br> Walk, Charlie?<br> Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.<br> Never felt like that. I mean,<br> something vaguely similar for Jilly...<br> ...when I was young.<br> Jilly?<br> Labrador.<br> Yes, it's odd, isn't it?<br> For years we've been single<br> and proud and never noticed...<br> ...that two of us were, for all intents<br> and purposes, married all this time.<br> Traitors in our midst.<br> You know, in a way, I think death<br> is hardest for the parents, don't you?<br> I hope I die before my children.<br> Tom...<br> ...there's one thing I find really...<br> It's your total confidence<br> that you will get married.<br> I mean, what if you never<br> find the right girl?<br> Sorry?<br> Surely, if that service<br> shows anything...<br> ...it shows that there is<br> a perfect match.<br> If we can't be<br> like Gareth and Matthew...<br> ...maybe we should just let it go.<br> Some of us are not<br> going to get married.<br> Well, I don't know, Charlie.<br> The truth is, unlike you...<br> ...I never expected the thunderbolt.<br> I always just hoped that I'd meet<br> some nice, friendly girl...<br> ...like the look of her.<br> Hope the look of me didn't<br> make her physically sick.<br> Then pop the question...<br> ...and settle down and be happy.<br> It worked for my parents.<br> Well, apart from the divorce<br> and all that.<br> I'll give you six months<br> at the outside, Tom.<br> Yeah, maybe you're right.<br> Maybe all this "waiting<br> for one true love" stuff...<br> ...gets you nowhere.<br> What the fuck is going on?<br> I thought we better make<br> absolutely sure we weren't late.<br> Excellent wedding hairstyle.<br> Matthew: The best-looking best<br> man in the world.<br> Listen...<br> ...thank you for doing this today.<br> Of course.<br> I wish Gareth was here.<br> Bet he does too.<br> I'm sorry I was so late.<br> The others are just parking the car.<br> I thought we'd all go with Tom.<br> Late? So late?<br> Yeah, it's 9:45.<br> - 9:45?<br> - Yep, 45 minutes till "I do."<br> Bloody Tom! I told him<br> to set the alarm for 8:00.<br> Fuck it!<br> Fuck!<br> Scarlett.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> - You ready?<br> Absolutely.<br> Give me 20 seconds.<br> - Time?<br> - Honestly?<br> Yes! Time?!<br> About 10 to 9:00.<br> Bastards.<br> Jessica, stop jumping<br> up and down, please.<br> This is splendid tuck.<br> Yes, I think I might say<br> a little word.<br> As many of you know, I've closely<br> observed Charles' love life for years.<br> Recently, I'd started to despair<br> and fear that he was married to us.<br> Apart from the fact that we won't<br> have his babies.<br> I don't know about that.<br> Fortunately, it's<br> turned out splendidly.<br> The girl in question<br> is sadly crazy...<br> ...but perhaps that's why<br> he loves her.<br> I'd like to propose a toast to<br> my Charlie and his beautiful girl...<br> ...on this tragic day.<br> So be happy and don't forget us.<br> Thank you.<br> To Charles and duckface.<br> To Charles and duckface!<br> - What do you think?<br> - You look divine.<br> It does work, doesn't it?<br> Yes.<br> I thank Fiona for those charming<br> words about my future wife.<br> I'd like to take this opportunity...<br> ...to read a little message<br> from her to you all.<br> This is exciting.<br> She says, "If any of you come near the<br> house, I'll set the dogs on you."<br> I think that's rather a nice touch.<br> "I'll set the dogs on you."<br> John, hi.<br> You made it. Good.<br> I hope me damn sister turns up.<br> Not much of a wedding without a bride.<br> Bit of a poor show, you not<br> having a stag night.<br> We did. We did.<br> We didn't think it was a very good<br> idea in this day and age.<br> Really?<br> Fi, you do look lovely today.<br> Yes, as you can see I've abandoned<br> my traditional black.<br> Yes, so you have.<br> From now on, I shall be all<br> the colors of the rainbow...<br> ...and fall in love with someone who<br> fancies me for a change.<br> Darling Fi.<br> - Look.<br> - What?<br> Lipstick everywhere.<br> That won't do at all.<br> Hi. Hi.<br> Good luck.<br> Hello. Glad you could come.<br> How are you?<br> Groom's on the right. Bride's, left.<br> Groom on the right.<br> Bride on the left.<br> Oh, my God!<br> I thought you'd gone back to Texas.<br> Without you, never.<br> Good luck.<br> The bride or groom?<br> Bride or groom?<br> It should be perfectly obvious<br> I'm neither.<br> Great God!<br> Bride or groom?<br> Bride.<br> Yes...<br> ...fine.<br> I've got a feeling we've met before.<br> We have. About 25 years ago.<br> I'm second cousin Harold's daughter,<br> Deirdre. You're Tom.<br> Good lord!<br> - So you're family.<br> - Yes.<br> Only very distant.<br> Well, yes, of course.<br> You said you were bride?<br> Yes.<br> Well, do sit.<br> Do sit here, Deirdre.<br> Golly.<br> Thunderbolt city.<br> Hello, Matthew.<br> - Hello, Charles.<br> - Bernard, how are you?<br> Exhausted, actually.<br> - That's funny. Charles.<br> - Hello, Lyd.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> You look lovely.<br> But I always did like you<br> dressed for weddings.<br> - And on time!<br> - Yep! Extraordinary thing, isn't it?<br> How's Hamish?<br> Oh, he's fine, I believe.<br> You believe?<br> Well, yes, he wasn't the man<br> for me after all.<br> You left him?<br> We left each other.<br> When?<br> A few months now.<br> March was hell. By April,<br> it was sordid.<br> That's the last time I marry<br> someone three times my age.<br> Charlie? Charles, time to travel.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Coming. Good.<br> Good.<br> So why didn't you<br> get in touch, then?<br> I did think about it.<br> I wanted to, but...<br> I was in a state.<br> So anyway, I don't want to keep you.<br> And I'll see you afterwards.<br> Yeah. Fine, excellent.<br> Wait.<br> I'll show you to your seat.<br> Just showing her to her seat.<br> Our timing's been<br> really bad, hasn't it?<br> It's been bad, yes.<br> It's been a disaster.<br> It has, as you say, been...<br> ...very bad indeed.<br> God, it's lovely to see you.<br> Well, good luck.<br> It's pretty easy.<br> Just say "I do" whenever anyone<br> asks you a question.<br> Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?<br> Yes, of course. Freshen up at will.<br> Dear lord, forgive me<br> for what I'm about to...<br> ...say in this magnificent<br> place of worship.<br> Bugger!<br> Bugger!<br> Bugger! Bugger! Bugger!<br> Bugger!<br> Can I help at all?<br> Huh? No. Thanks.<br> Sorry.<br> Vocal exercises. Big church.<br> Excellent. Often do the same myself.<br> Not exactly the same<br> vocab, obviously.<br> Rather more hallelujahs.<br> I'll leave you.<br> Bride's arriving.<br> Fabulous! We seem to have<br> lost the groom.<br> Stall her, and I'll see<br> if I can find him.<br> Roger. Wilco.<br> Charles.<br> It's good to see you.<br> Yeah. Yeah.<br> Matt, what do we think about marriage?<br> Gosh.<br> Well, I think it's really good...<br> ...if you love the person with<br> all your heart.<br> Well, exactly.<br> Quite.<br> All these weddings. All these years.<br> All that blasted salmon and champagne.<br> Here I am on my own wedding day...<br> ...and I'm still thinking.<br> Can I ask about what?<br> No.<br> No, I think best not.<br> I'm sorry, there's a delay. A<br> problem with the flowers.<br> Flowers? What?<br> Unfortunately, there are a high<br> proportion of hay fever sufferers...<br> ...who've been stuck right by<br> the damn flowers.<br> So we're moving the congregation.<br> Don't want the vows<br> obliterated by sneezing.<br> Would it be out of place for me to say<br> time's ticking by?<br> Should've started by now.<br> I think I've fooled them so far.<br> If you have a reputation for being<br> stupid, people are less suspicious.<br> Hello.<br> Here you are.<br> Ready to face the enemy?<br> Are we?<br> Yes.<br> Excellent.<br> Not so tight, Dad!<br> Dearly beloved...<br> ...we are gathered together<br> here in the sight of God...<br> ...and in the face<br> of this congregation...<br> ...to join together this man<br> and this woman in holy matrimony...<br> ...which is an honorable estate...<br> ...instituted of God in the time<br> of man's innocence.<br> Signifying unto us<br> the mystical union...<br> ...that is betwixt Christ<br> and His church...<br> ...and therefore is not<br> by any to be enterprized...<br> ...nor taken in hand unadvisedly,<br> lightly, or wantonly...<br> ...but reverently, discreetly,<br> advisedly...<br> ...soberly, and in the fear of God.<br> Therefore, if any man can show<br> any just cause...<br> ...why they may not<br> lawfully be joined together...<br> ...let him speak now<br> or else hereafter...<br> ...forever hold his peace.<br> I'm sorry, does someone have<br> something to say?<br> Yes? What is it?<br> One second.<br> What's going on?<br> - He wants me to translate.<br> - What is he saying?<br> He says, "I suspect the groom<br> is having doubts.<br> I suspect the groom would<br> like to delay."<br> "I suspect the groom..."<br> What's he saying?<br> He says...<br> ...he suspects the groom...<br> ...loves someone else.<br> And do you?<br> Do you love someone else?<br> Do you, Charles?<br> I do.<br> Get out of my way!<br> Let me kill him!<br> Blimey.<br> At least it's one we won't forget.<br> A lot of weddings just blend<br> into each other.<br> Oh, for God's sake.<br> This one will stick out<br> in the memory.<br> For not actually including<br> a wedding service.<br> Poor girl.<br> No, I mean it, poor girl!<br> She's not my favorite person...<br> ...but what you did today<br> might be unforgivable.<br> I can't bear to think about it.<br> Poor Hen.<br> Though, let's face facts.<br> If you weren't sure<br> you wanted to marry her today...<br> ...of all days, i.e.,<br> your wedding day...<br> ...then it must be the right<br> decision, mustn't it?<br> Quite right, Tom.<br> It was a lovely dress.<br> Useful for parties.<br> What did he say, Charles?<br> Says he blames himself.<br> Absolutely not.<br> No, you mustn't, David.<br> No, no. If there's<br> music to be faced...<br> ...I should be facing it.<br> Hello.<br> Hi! You're soaking. Come in.<br> No, no. I'm fine.<br> Comes a point you can't get wetter.<br> - Okay, I'll come out.<br> - No, please don't.<br> I just wanted to check<br> you're okay.<br> Not busy killing yourself<br> or anything, but...<br> But you're fine, so...<br> I shouldn't have come to the church<br> this morning. I'm sorry.<br> No! No!<br> Wait. It was all my fault.<br> I mean, I'm the bastard here.<br> And it definitely sorted out one<br> thing, which is, marriage and me...<br> ...we're very clearly not meant<br> for one another.<br> Sorted out another big thing as well.<br> There I was, standing there<br> in the church...<br> ...and for the first time in<br> my whole life I realized I...<br> ...totally and utterly<br> loved one person.<br> And it wasn't the person standing<br> next to me in the veil, it's...<br> ...the person standing<br> opposite me now...<br> ...in the rain.<br> Is it still raining?<br> I hadn't noticed.<br> The truth of it is...<br> ...I've loved you from<br> the first second I met you.<br> You're not suddenly going<br> away again, are you?<br> No. I might drown,<br> but otherwise, no.<br> Okay, okay. We'll go in.<br> But first, let me ask you one thing.<br> Do you think...<br> ...after we've dried off...<br> ...after we've spent<br> lots more time together...<br> ...you might agree...<br> ...not to marry me?<br> And do you think...<br> ...not being married to me might<br> be something you could consider...<br> ...doing for the rest of your life?<br> Do you?<br> I do.<br>
