Up, up, up up!<br> Careful, guys.<br> This corpse is still breathing.<br> Try to get me there<br> in one piece.<br> Hello, Professor.<br> Hello, Frida.<br> Diego Rivera is back<br> in the auditorium!<br> - Who cares?<br> - With a naked woman.<br> Oh, yeah. Yeah.<br> Shh.<br> Why is this whore still here?<br> Huh?<br> Tell me.<br> Tell me, mi amor.<br> Are you planning to have her<br> after lunch,<br> or have you fucked her<br> already?<br> Lupe, please don't start.<br> Y-You think I don't know<br> what's going on.<br> You must think I'm an idiot.<br> - I can't work like this.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> Your food and your slut.<br> That's all you need to paint<br> your pinche murals!<br> Hey! Get out!<br> And don't come home!<br> Don't come home and give me<br> one of your speeches<br> about the artist and the people<br> and your fucking revolution!<br> You only care about yourself,<br> you piece of shit!<br> So much for lunch.<br> Although...<br> I could eat you, perhaps.<br> I-I've eaten female flesh<br> before. Yeah.<br> Yes.<br> Wrapped up in... tortillas.<br> Tastes like...<br> the tenderest young pig.<br> Watch out, Diego!<br> Lupe's coming back!<br> Fucking punks!<br> Come on,<br> you little anarchists!<br> Let's go! Frida!<br> Just keeping you honest,<br> panzon.<br> Panzon.<br> Do I look fat to you?<br> Shh!<br> Shh!<br> Shh, shh, shh, shh!<br> Oh, yeah.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Gracias.<br> Frida, we found<br> the most beautiful fabric<br> for my wedding dress today.<br> Fantastic.<br> It cost a fortune.<br> - Mama?<br> - Yes?<br> Are these ripe?<br> They should be.<br> Let me see.<br> Yes, they're fine.<br> Just need a day or two.<br> Maybe you'll get married,<br> too, one day.<br> One can only hope.<br> Lunch is almost ready.<br> Go get the artist.<br> I love this one.<br> It's beautiful.<br> I like it, too.<br> They're busy with the wedding.<br> Cristina is so excited<br> about her dress.<br> Good.<br> Everyone should be excited<br> when they get married.<br> I suppose.<br> If that's what you want.<br> And, uh... what do you want?<br> I don't know.<br> I just don't think<br> that marriage is for everyone.<br> Well, you need<br> a good reason to do it,<br> just like with anything else.<br> What do you think matters most<br> for a good marriage?<br> A short memory.<br> Why did you get married,<br> Papa?<br> I can't remember.<br> So I could have you.<br> And concentrate, everybody.<br> Wait. Where is Frida?<br> Adriana, go tell your sister<br> to hurry up.<br> I always wanted a son.<br> And, Matilde, everyone,<br> eyes to the camera,<br> and...<br> Come on.<br> We'll miss our bus.<br> - Frida!<br> - Excuse me.<br> How much is the calaca?<br> Frida, come on!<br> - The bus!<br> - We'll take the next one.<br> No, no, no!<br> Come, come, come!<br> W-Watch out. Hey! Hey.<br> Anyway, I just don't think<br> he's completely apolitical.<br> That's all.<br> But that's because you read it<br> after you read Marx.<br> You... you always read things<br> in the wrong order!<br> That's ridiculous.<br> Why should it matter<br> what order you read it in?<br> Because if you have<br> already read Marx,<br> then of course Hegel is<br> going to seem political.<br> But the truth is the idea<br> of history as a dialectic.<br> It just predicts Marx...<br> Is that gold? Real gold?<br> For the ceiling<br> of the opera house.<br> Move!<br> Move it, idiot!<br> Your brake!<br> The spinal column was broken,<br> as were the collarbone<br> and two ribs.<br> The pelvis is broken<br> in three places.<br> The metal rod entered<br> the right side of the body<br> and came out the vagina.<br> The right leg has<br> And the foot was crushed.<br> Will she ever walk again?<br> Let's make sure<br> she lives first.<br> Is Alex alive?<br> - Frida.<br> - Is he all right?<br> He was hurt, but not terribly.<br> He was here yesterday<br> when you were not awake.<br> And Mama?<br> It was too much for them,<br> Fridocha. They are at home.<br> How long have I been here?<br> Three weeks.<br> We're almost there.<br> Gently, now.<br> There is nothing left to spend.<br> I will sell<br> some of my equipment.<br> For another operation<br> that probably won't work.<br> No. No. Listen.<br> Maybe this time it will work.<br> And then how will you<br> make money?<br> I'll... paint portraits again.<br> Admit it, Guillermo.<br> She'll never walk again.<br> Go on in, Alex.<br> She's waiting for you.<br> Hello, ugly.<br> They're beautiful.<br> How do you feel?<br> Like I've been hit by a bus.<br> Come on, silly.<br> Come, come. Come sit with me.<br> Look.<br> It's my only good angle<br> at the moment.<br> No, it's not.<br> I like you this way.<br> You're easier to keep up with.<br> Spengler...<br> because you love him.<br> Schopenhauer<br> because it's good for you.<br> Oh, Alex.<br> You know I adore you.<br> I've missed you so much.<br> I told the doctor the handrail<br> had taken my virginity.<br> And I'm sure he believed you.<br> You know...<br> when I get out of this cast,<br> I'm going to show you<br> a couple of things<br> I still remember from before.<br> Okay.<br> What?<br> My aunt and my uncle are<br> leaving for Europe, and...<br> they've invited me<br> to come along.<br> But that's wonderful.<br> When would you leave?<br> Soon.<br> Next week.<br> How long will you be gone?<br> They're going for two months,<br> and... afterwards I might<br> stay on at the Sorbonne.<br> I will be staying on.<br> Did I tell you<br> that I'm going to walk again?<br> Yes.<br> Do you believe it?<br> Of course I do.<br> You'd better.<br> Because<br> you're going to miss it.<br> N-No.<br> Frida...<br> I want you to leave<br> before I finish this butterfly.<br> How are you feeling?<br> How am I feeling?<br> I can't even remember what<br> it felt like before the pain.<br> Isn't that horrible?<br> Dr. Farril is coming<br> on Monday.<br> He is bringing<br> a back specialist,<br> Dr. Cervantes.<br> I feel like some rich girl<br> with a new suitor every week.<br> But all my suitors<br> have turned into doctors.<br> And I'm not a rich girl,<br> Papa.<br> How come you never ask me<br> about my plans anymore?<br> Hmm?<br> You used to always say,<br> "Tell me your plans, Frida."<br> What are your plans... Frida?<br> Right now I'm a burden.<br> But I hope to be a<br> self-sufficient cripple one day.<br> After that, I don't know.<br> You are not a burden...<br> my love.<br> See? Here.<br> We have something for you.<br> Matilde, come.<br> We noticed that there was<br> no more room left on your cast,<br> - Oh.<br> - So...<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Now you look like<br> a gringa movie star.<br> Let me see.<br> It's too much money.<br> Mama, Papa...<br> I have a surprise.<br> Careful, now.<br> Don't worry. Don't worry.<br> It's all right.<br> Aah!<br> Do you want a rich tamale?<br> Delicious...<br> I need the ochre.<br> - Is it ready?<br> - Almost.<br> No. Now.<br> I need it now.<br> Okay.<br> Seor Rivera?<br> Diego!<br> Who are you?<br> What do you want?<br> I have something important<br> to discuss with you.<br> I'm working.<br> I'll wait.<br> I don't have time to chat<br> with schoolgirls.<br> I'm not a schoolgirl, panzon.<br> Okay. Come on up here.<br> No. You come down.<br> What?<br> Look, I didn't come here<br> for fun or to flirt.<br> I've done some paintings<br> which I want you<br> to look over professionally,<br> and I need an absolutely<br> straightforward opinion<br> of my work.<br> You were that girl<br> in the auditorium.<br> Yes, I was, but that has<br> nothing to do with now.<br> I just want<br> your serious opinion.<br> What... what do you care<br> about my opinion?<br> If you're a real painter,<br> you'll paint<br> because you can't live<br> without painting.<br> You'll paint<br> till you die, okay?<br> I have to work<br> to earn a living,<br> so I don't have time<br> to fool around just for vanity.<br> If I'm not good enough,<br> I have to do something else<br> to help my parents.<br> Leave the best one here.<br> Go home and paint another one.<br> If this one's any good,<br> I'll come and look at that one<br> on my day off.<br> Orozco is a true artist.<br> He's tremendous.<br> And Siqueiros could be great<br> if he'd pull his head out<br> of his own ass and look around.<br> Comrade Rivera.<br> What a nice surprise.<br> What if I told you<br> that easel painting like yours<br> is finished,<br> that it's headed<br> for the trash<br> like other elitist,<br> bourgeois pastimes?<br> I'd say cut the propaganda.<br> This is very good work.<br> You have real talent.<br> Oh, come on.<br> I'm not looking<br> for your compliments.<br> I want a serious critique.<br> But I'm being sincere.<br> These are<br> very original paintings...<br> none of the usual tricks.<br> But that's...<br> that's not specific.<br> You have to trust<br> a true compliment<br> as much as a critique.<br> Yeah, well, some people<br> have told me not to trust<br> what you say.<br> They say if a girl asks<br> your opinion,<br> and she's not<br> a complete fright,<br> you'll gush all over her.<br> I need you to tell me<br> one thing honestly...<br> do you actually believe<br> that I should continue to paint?<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> You'll like Tina.<br> She's a brilliant<br> photographer,<br> one of the few<br> with real taste.<br> Do you know Alvarez Bravo?<br> I know his work.<br> It's good.<br> I'll introduce you to him.<br> He'll want to photograph you.<br> Without clothes, of course.<br> Of course.<br> That's the thing<br> about these radicals.<br> They're a little dangerous,<br> but they definitely throw<br> the best parties.<br> Ah, at last!<br> The monster!<br> Tina!<br> This is Frida Kahlo.<br> She's a wonderful painter.<br> She wants to be<br> a wonderful painter.<br> Oh, don't be shy.<br> Nobody really thinks their own<br> stuff is good except Diego.<br> He's the only one who's sure.<br> Go find Siqueiros.<br> He's been bad-mouthing you<br> again.<br> You come with me.<br> Great party.<br> Everybody, I have someone<br> for you to meet.<br> This is Frida Kahlo.<br> She came with Diego.<br> Another pretty girl...<br> She's quite a talent, no?<br> Julio Mella, the Cuban.<br> Tina took the last photo<br> of him.<br> She was with him on the street<br> when they gunned him down.<br> Incredible.<br> They're like clay<br> in his hands.<br> It must be that body.<br> No.<br> It's the way he looks<br> at you...<br> and finds beauty<br> in all your imperfections.<br> It's irresistible.<br> You'd never think it<br> to look at him,<br> but he's had<br> half the women here.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Did you come with him?<br> Oh, n...<br> we're just friends.<br> I'm Frida Kahlo.<br> I'm a painter.<br> A painter. No wonder.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> I'm Lupe Mar n.<br> I'm his wife.<br> Ah...<br> I was his wife.<br> Good luck to you.<br> Bad-mouth him<br> all you want, Diego.<br> But while we have been talking<br> about socialism<br> over drinks at parties<br> for 10 years,<br> Stalin is making it work.<br> He's achieving it.<br> Achieving what?<br> His only big idea so far<br> is to throw out all<br> the real thinkers in the land.<br> But he...<br> he just threw you out.<br> No. Not just me.<br> No, not just you.<br> Mr. Trotsky... a man<br> who plays the martyr<br> when, in truth, he was rejected<br> by his own country.<br> - Good riddance.<br> - No.<br> He had to run for his life.<br> Stalin would have had him shot.<br> That's his version<br> of socialism...<br> kill anyone<br> who disagrees with you.<br> Well, some people have to get<br> shot in a revolution, you know.<br> Well, I prefer evolution.<br> Educate the poor.<br> Mobilize the workers.<br> Rise like a slow tide.<br> But you...<br> you'll have your revolution<br> and kill half the poor<br> to save them.<br> Diego, this from a Communist<br> who's getting rich<br> painting for the government<br> and wealthy patrons?<br> I can't help it<br> if the rich have good taste.<br> The rich don't have<br> good taste.<br> They pay someone<br> to have good taste for them.<br> And they don't hire you<br> because you are good.<br> They hire you because you<br> assuage their sense of guilt.<br> They use you, Diego,<br> and you are too vain<br> to see it.<br> -

We don't even have<br> enough to get to Chicago.<br> We're not going to Chicago.<br> They canceled the commission.<br> It's time to go home.<br> What?!<br> With my tail between my legs?<br> We don't belong here.<br> I am tired of these people,<br> and I am tired of<br> who you are around them.<br> See that?!<br> Hmm?

Fri...<br> Get out! Get out!<br> - Frida.<br> Frida.<br> I'm a beast.<br> Yes.<br> I-I-I-I'm an idiot, but it meant<br> nothing, Frida, nothing.<br> Frida, talk to me!<br> There have been two big<br> accidents in my life, Diego...<br> the trolley and you.<br> You are by far the worst.<br> Get out!<br> Out! Out! Go!<br> It's a limp up three flights<br> of stairs,<br> I can't afford any furniture,<br> and it's cold at night.<br> But at least I know who's<br> fucking who in my own house.<br> Diego's not giving you<br> any money?<br> I'd rather be poor.<br> She was my sister...<br> not some model.<br> My own sister.<br> To hell with him.<br> To hell with him.<br> Find some work.<br> Pay your own bills for a while.<br> I'll sell some paintings.<br> Not enough to cover<br> your bar bill.<br> No, don't get me wrong...<br> I love your paintings...<br> I'm just not sure you should<br> count on them for a living.<br> They're tough, you know.<br> I mean, look at this.<br> What the hell is this?<br> It was in the damn papers.<br> A man stabbed his wife<br> and when the judge asked him<br> why he did it,<br> he said, "But it was just<br> a few small nips."<br> Oh.<br> Mmh.<br> Who's that?<br> The ghost of Frida Kahlo.<br> Oh...<br> I remember her.<br> How are you?<br> Lonely.<br> Only you ghosts come<br> to visit these days.<br> So...<br> how is your Diego?<br> I don't know why<br> I called him that.<br> He was never mine.<br> Never will be.<br> But he's fine.<br> Painting, I guess.<br> And you?<br> Are you also painting?<br> Yes.<br> And I want you to pose for me.<br> You don't even have to<br> leave the house.<br> I want to leave the house.<br> All right, then.<br> We'll go somewhere different<br> every day.<br> That sounds good.<br> You've painted everyone else<br> in the family.<br> Yes.<br> A long time ago.<br> Remind me what I wanted then.<br> You wanted to be<br> your own person.<br> Frida...<br> She never liked you, you know.<br> She told me you would only<br> bring me troubles.<br> There is something<br> I must discuss with you...<br> A favor I need to ask of you.<br> You've got a lot of nerve<br> to come here asking me<br> to do you favors.<br> No, it's not for me.<br> It's Trotsky.<br> The Norwegians<br> have expelled him,<br> no other country<br> will take him,<br> and Stalin wants him dead.<br> I have appealed<br> to President Cardenas myself.<br> They have granted him asylum<br> here in Mexico.<br> I want you to welcome him<br> with me.<br> Let him live<br> in your father's house.<br> I know it's a lot to ask,<br> but this is a difficult<br> transition for them.<br> And you, Frida...<br> you bring life and warmth<br> to any place.<br> Anyway...<br> Trotsky is a very great man<br> in enormous danger,<br> and we have the opportunity<br> to help him.<br> Yes, all right.<br> Such commotion.<br> I don't understand...<br> such a commotion<br> for a philosopher.<br> A very great man, Papa.<br> A true revolutionary.<br> It's an important service<br> we're doing.<br> If you admire him,<br> why don't you advise him<br> not to get involved<br> in politics?<br> Politics are ruinous.<br> Good advice, Papa.<br> I'm sure he'll agree.<br> I regret it was not possible<br> for me to meet you at your boat.<br> Natalia and I,<br> we are deeply indebted to you<br> for your generosity<br> in these difficult times.<br> Your charming wife,<br> she has made the last leg<br> of our trip such a delight.<br> We are profoundly honored<br> to have you and your wife<br> in our home.<br> Ay, Diego, they're starving.<br> Let's feed them.<br> Thank you.<br> No, i-it's true!<br> It's true!<br> I could not believe it!<br> These people are idiots!<br> They scream about<br> Hitler's aggression,<br> a-a-and then sing<br> Stalin's praises.<br> Aren't they the same creature?<br> Yes, but not exactly.<br> Of course<br> they are both monsters,<br> but Hitler at least<br> is a madman with a vision.<br> Vision? He's insane!<br> Of course he is insane,<br> but he has the ability<br> to mobilize the people's minds,<br> whereas Stalin, he's...<br> he is so dull.<br> There is the brutality,<br> but when you get<br> right down to it,<br> Stalin is nothing<br> but a bureaucrat,<br> and that is what is<br> smothering our revolution.<br> They are the same,<br> but only in that the insanity<br> of power has overruled them.<br> And between them,<br> they will consume<br> the continent.<br> Madness.<br> Yes... but a challenge.<br> Look at us...<br> Mexican, Russian, French...<br> in this wonderful new planet<br> Rivera.<br> I tell you this, my friends,<br> in the experience<br> of my lifetime,<br> the failure and the pain<br> have certainly outstripped<br> the triumphs.<br> But this has not only<br> not destroyed my faith...<br> my faith in reason, in truth,<br> in human solidarity...<br> but, on the contrary,<br> it has made it<br> indestructible.<br> I see the hope of the world<br> in you,<br> and, from my heart,<br> I thank you.<br> Na zdorov'ya!<br> - Na zdorov'ya!<br> - Na zdorov'ya!<br> - Salud!<br> - Salud!<br> Imagine living your life<br> like that...<br> with a price on your head...<br> and staying so calm.<br> Yes.<br> Good night, Diego.<br> Whoo.<br> Oh, stop it, Andre.<br> I hate flattery.<br> I don't care.<br> It is wonderful, wonderful work.<br> You've seen all these,<br> I take it?<br> Of course.<br> I tell her all the time.<br> Julian Levy took a couple<br> of her paintings to New York<br> and sold both of them,<br> and she sold another four<br> to that actor...<br> t-t-the gangster.<br> Edward G. Robinson.<br> Yeah, for $200 apiece.<br> He was robbed.<br> We haven't been able<br> to fool anyone else.<br> My little paintings can't mean<br> anything to anyone but me.<br> Stop!<br> Get down!<br> They put a bag by the door!<br> Get back!<br> - Let's get inside.<br> - Get back!<br> - Inside, quickly.<br> - There is no time.<br> - Cover him! Hurry!<br> - Inside. Everybody inside.<br> - Take him inside!<br> - Frida!<br> Frida, what are you doing?!<br> Hallowed be Thy name...<br> I give you five seconds<br> to get out of here.<br> One!<br> - Two!<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> Sorry about that.<br> It was my mother's sisters.<br> What do you mean?<br> They were leaving icons<br> and sprinkling holy water.<br> They think this house<br> is cursed,<br> and that you<br> are the antichrist.<br> I want you to think<br> about it seriously.<br> You could be part of the<br> Mexican exhibition in Paris.<br> What I really want is a show<br> in my own country.<br> Which they will give you<br> once you become famous<br> somewhere else.<br> Your paintings should be seen.<br> So, who is coming up with me?<br> It's harder than you think.<br> Ah, everything<br> is harder than we think.<br> I'll go.<br> Are you sure?<br> If an old man can do it,<br> why not a cripple?<br> No, no, no, no.<br> It's okay.<br> I don't think assassins<br> are awaiting at the top.<br> I'll race you.<br> Frida...<br> how were you hurt?<br> I couldn't even tell you<br> anymore.<br> I've been cut into, rebroke,<br> and reset so many times.<br> I'm like a jigsaw puzzle.<br> And all the operations<br> have done more damage<br> than the accident,<br> for all I know.<br> Everything hurts.<br> But the leg...<br> the leg is the worst.<br> But I'm all right.<br> At the end of the day,<br> we can endure much more<br> than we think we can.<br> That's what I loved<br> about your paintings...<br> that they carry that message.<br> You said that nobody<br> would care about them,<br> but I think you are wrong...<br> because your paintings express<br> what everyone feels...<br> that they are alone in pain.<br> Maybe.<br> Leon...<br> tell me about your children.<br> My children.<br> We knew the girls had been<br> murdered and one of the boys.<br> We thought the other<br> was still alive in the prison.<br> But that letter came.<br> He was executed, too.<br> They are all gone.<br> I have condemned my family...<br> as I am condemned.<br> You mustn't say that.<br> But it's true.<br> Stalin has more power<br> than any tsar.<br> I'm alone with few friends<br> and no resources<br> against the world's biggest<br> killing machine.<br> So what can I do<br> but keep on working... living.<br> You cannot imagine what a joy<br> it is for me to be here,<br> to see all this.<br> It is the first time I felt<br> like a real person in years.<br> In his book<br> "State and Revolution,"<br> Lenin purged from the genuine<br> teaching of Karl Marx<br> all the spurious ingredients<br> introduced<br> by the social democracy.<br> John, I am picking it up<br> from "social democracy."<br> Frida.<br> This is the book I mentioned.<br> Tell me what you think.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll be back in an hour.<br> No, no, no, no, no.<br> It is better this way.<br> We will stop disrupting<br> your lives.<br> We're not going far,<br> just around the corner.<br> I wish you would reconsider,<br> if only for security.<br> We will be more than safe.<br> Trust me.<br> Do svidaniya.<br> Many thanks, my friend.<br> We'll see you soon.<br> Natalia...<br> It makes no sense.<br> It was for his own well-being.<br> He's not thinking<br> of his well-being.<br> He's thinking of hers.<br> What are you talking about?<br> I'm talking about somebody<br> willing to sacrifice a little<br> of their own pleasure<br> rather than go on hurting<br> the woman who loves him.<br> Have you lost your mind?!<br> Go to hell, Diego.<br> You know what the consequences<br> of this could be?<br> He's not scared.<br> Why should you be?<br> Oh, dear, God, Frida,<br> of all people, why?!<br> Because we wanted to.<br> You've broken my heart, Frida.<br> It hurts, doesn't it?<br> But why?<br> It was just a fuck,<br> like a handshake.<br> I told you who I was<br> when you married me.<br> Yes, you did,<br> and I married you anyway,<br> and you promised to be loyal.<br> You've been my comrade,<br> my fellow artist,<br> my best friend.<br> But you've never been<br> my husband.<br> Fridocha...<br> "Dear Diego,<br> how are you, panzon?<br> Why didn't you tell me Paris<br> was such a nightmare?"<br> "The French are the most<br> pretentious bores in the world.<br> "I'd rather sit on the floor<br> of a market in Toluca<br> "selling tortillas<br> "than have to listen<br> to the prattling<br> of the artistic bitches<br> of Paris."<br> "There really hasn't been<br> as much interest<br> in the exhibition<br> as Breton promised."<br> "Mexican artists are nothing<br> but an exotic curiosity here."<br> "All in all,<br> it's been lonely,<br> and I crave news from home."<br> "Diego, this letter is a lie.<br> "Paris has been good to me.<br> "But without you,<br> it means nothing.<br> "All the rage of our 12 years<br> together passes through me,<br> "and I'm left knowing that I<br> love you more than my own skin.<br> "And though<br> you may not love me as much,<br> "you do love me a little,<br> don't you?<br> "If this is not true,<br> "I'll always be hopeful<br> that it could be.<br> "I adore you.<br> Frida."<br> There are rumors going around<br> that I wanted Trotsky killed.<br> We fought lately, it's true,<br> but...<br> They may try<br> to arrest me again.<br> Talk to the president.<br> No.<br> No, I'm going to California.<br> - California?<br> - Yes.<br> And, Frida...<br> I want us to divorce.<br> For who...<br> that American actress?<br> Jesus, Diego.<br> No, Frida, no.<br> It will be better this way.<br> We have both done better<br> as friends.<br> - I haven't.<br> - You have.<br> You're doing very well<br> on your own.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> You don't need...<br> If you want to go, just go.<br> Listen to me...<br> I don't particularly care<br> for Mr. Trotsky,<br> but we can't go around<br> having political refugees<br> murdered in our country.<br> Now, can we?<br> Once more,<br> where is your husband?<br> I don't have a husband.<br> Frida?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Cristi.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Oh.<br> It was not your fault.<br> It was mine.<br> I should have never put you<br> in the room with him.<br> What did you do<br> to get me out of here?<br> Diego. He went crazy<br> when he heard.<br> He called President Cardenas<br> immediately.<br> Ay.<br> Diego.<br> Not much more.<br> How long has your foot<br> been like this?<br> Who knows? Let's take<br> one disaster at a time.<br> Just patch me up<br> so I can paint, please.<br> These are gangrened.<br> They'll have to come off.<br> You're lucky it hasn't spread<br> to your leg.<br> You've lost weight.<br> Ah.<br> You've lost your toes.<br> Is that why you're here...<br> to offer your condolences?<br> I'm here to see how you are.<br> How do you feel?<br> Tired of answering<br> that question.<br> Otherwise, like shit.<br> How are you?<br> I'm...<br> I'm here to...<br> ask you to marry me.<br> I don't need rescuing, Diego.<br> I do.<br> I've lost the toes<br> of one foot.<br> My back is useless.<br> I have an infection<br> of the kidneys.<br> I smoke. I drink. I curse.<br> I can't have children.<br> I have no money,<br> and a stack of hospital bills.<br> Should I keep going?<br> That's practically a letter<br> of recommendation.<br> Frida...<br> Frida...<br> I miss... us.<br> They say you should never<br> believe a limping dog<br> or the tears of a woman.<br> They're wrong.<br> Cristina!<br> Come on!<br> Aaah!<br> "Feet, what do I need you for<br> if I have wings to fly?"<br> I want you to burn<br> this Judas of a body.<br> I don't want to be buried.<br> I've spent enough time<br> lying down.<br> Burn it.<br> Frida...<br> No, I don't think<br> I'm Frida anymore.<br> I think all the Frida in me<br> has disappeared.<br> Look at what's left.<br> Why do you stay?<br> You stupid girl.<br> Are you crazy?<br> I forbid it!<br> Stop it, Diego!<br> You can't force me to stay!<br> - Oh, yes, I can!<br> - Give it to me!<br> No, Frida!<br> No, we've been through<br> all this before!<br> I'm going, damn it!<br> Give me back my fucking leg!<br> Doctor, please help me.<br> What's going on here?<br> I told her<br> she had to stay in bed.<br> She demanded we call you.<br> - I'm going to my exhibition.<br> - Frida...<br> I've waited for a show in<br> my own country my whole life.<br> I'm not going to miss it.<br> If the bronchitis gets worse,<br> it will turn into pneumonia.<br> Frida, under no circumstances<br> are you to leave this bed.<br> I'll bring you back<br> all the gossip, I promise.<br> Cristina!<br> There was this skinny kid<br> with these eyebrows<br> shouting up at me,<br> "Diego, I want to show you<br> my paintings!"<br> But, of course,<br> she made me come down to her.<br> I did, and I've<br> never stopped looking.<br> But I want to speak about Frida<br> not as her husband,<br> but as an artist.<br> I admire her.<br> Her work is acid and tender...<br> hard as steel...<br> and fine<br> as a butterfly's wing.<br> Loveable as a smile...<br> cruel as...<br> the bitterness of life.<br> I-I-I don't believe...<br> that ever before has a woman<br> put such agonized poetry<br> on canvas.<br> Shut up, panzon.<br> Who died?<br> Where is the music?<br> You see, doctorcito,<br> I followed your orders.<br> I didn't leave my bed.<br> Frida.<br> Ay, doctor, if you let me<br> have this tequila,<br> I promise not to drink<br> at my funeral.<br> It's a deal.<br> To Frida!<br> To Frida!<br> Are you all right?<br> Lie down with me.<br> mi Dieguito.<br> Frida.<br> Happy silver.<br> It's not for two more weeks.<br>
