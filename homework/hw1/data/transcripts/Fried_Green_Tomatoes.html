I can't find it.<br> Why did you tell me to<br> turn right 10 miles back there?<br> God, you got a negative<br> sense of direction, hon.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, Ed, your aunt's gonna be<br> so disappointed we're late.<br> I know she's been looking forward<br> to this visit all week long.<br> Bless her sweet,<br> little ol' heart.<br> Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V<br> this afternoon?<br> Remember us?<br> Don't you look pretty!<br> We brought you something.<br> Let me look at<br> you.<br> Don't you know Evelyn loves you?<br> Well, honey, I guess it'd be<br> better if you wait out here for me.<br> I'll get all this stuff.<br> Well, if you think it's best.<br> Yeah, I do this time.<br> Okay?<br> Have a nice day,<br> Aunt Vesta.<br> Don't you pitch a fit like that!<br> Did you know<br> they took my gallbladder out?<br> No, I didn't.<br> Oh, yes. Still<br> in the hospital in a jar.<br> I guess that's where<br> they keep 'em.<br> I guess.<br> When I was<br> in the hospital,<br> the nurse gave me one of them<br> Fleet enemas they're so fond of.<br> Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,<br> imagine that.<br> Actually,<br> everybody calls me Ninny.<br> 'Course I'm<br> just visitin' here.<br> Did you ever have<br> one of them Fleet enemas?<br> Um, well?<br> No.<br> You'd remember it.<br> Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,<br> come from Whistle Stop.<br> You ever been<br> to Whistle Stop?<br> Why, yes.

She'll listen<br> to you. Come on down, little bit.<br> There's no firin'<br> squad waitin' for you.<br> Ohh! Come on,<br> honey. Let us see you.<br> You look so pretty.<br> I see London, I see...

Oysters?<br> I tell you about the oysters? No.<br> Think about the millions<br> of oysters lyin'around the ocean.<br> Then one day...<br> God comes along and sees one<br> and he says,<br> "I think I'm gonna make<br> that one different."<br> You know what he does?<br> He puts a little<br> piece of sand in it.<br> Guess what it can do that<br> the others can't. What?<br> It can make<br> a beautiful pearl.<br> What if God<br> made a mistake?<br> Well, the way I figure it,<br> he never makes mistakes.<br> I mean, he made sure<br> we got together.<br> He made sure you got<br> the best looking,<br> most charmin' brother<br> in the world...<br> who's gonna beat you to the<br> chocolate cake. You will not.<br> Got you out of the tree,<br> didn't I?<br> Did not!<br> Into this estate,<br> these two come now to be joined.<br> If any man present<br> can show cause...<br> why they may not lawfully<br> be joined together,<br> let him speak now or<br> forever after hold his peace.<br> Please be seated.<br> If either of you<br> know any reason...<br> why you may not justly be joined<br> together in holy matrimony,<br> do you now confess it?<br> It is then your will<br> to proceed.<br> Do you,<br> Charles Osgood Justice...<br> Thank you. I don't know what<br> we'd do without your generosity.<br> Sipsey, especially you.<br> Look what you've done!<br> Thank you, Mrs.<br> Threadgoode. Gimme that, you rascal!<br> Ohh!<br> Jump on my back.<br> I don't think there ever was<br> a sweeter boy than Buddy Threadgoode.<br> You look beautiful, Lily.<br> Yes, Lily, you sure do.<br> I had the biggest crush on him.<br> He was a terrible flirt!<br> But his heart belonged<br> to Ruth Jamison.<br> She was the daughter of<br> a friend of his mama's...<br> who was visitin'<br> that summer.<br> Ruth Jamison, you're just<br> the one I've been lookin' for.<br> Are you thirsty? Let's<br> go visit someplace else.<br> A little nest<br> that's nestled<br> Think that's a big lake, you should've<br> seen the one next to our house.<br> We used to swim in it<br> and fish.<br> I sure do miss it.<br> Sure do.<br> What happened to it?<br> Did it dry up?<br> No, worse than that.<br> Last fall,<br> a flock of ducks,<br> 40 or 50 of'em, landed right<br> smack in the middle of it.<br> This fluke thing<br> happened.<br> The temperature dropped so fast<br> that the whole lake froze...<br> in three seconds,<br> just like that!<br> Those poor little ducks.<br> Did it kill them?<br> No, they flew off<br> and took the lake with 'em.<br> To this very day, that lake<br> is somewhere over in Georgia.<br> Buddy Threadgoode.<br> Come a little closer.<br> I wanna give you something.<br> Come here.<br> Whoop!<br> You'll see<br> a smiling face<br> Come back here, hat.<br> Where do you think you're goin'?<br> Whoa!<br> I got it.

"<br> Oh, it like<br> to have killed us all.<br> But nary a one took it<br> as hard as Idgie,<br> everyone thought she'd die<br> right along with him.<br> Night after night,<br> she stayed by the river.<br> Big George was the only soul<br> she'd let near her,<br> and he watched over her<br> night and day.<br> You know,<br> a heart can be broken,<br> but it still keeps a-beatin'<br> Just the same.<br> Miss Idgie, you'll have<br> to keep this blanket on...<br> or you'll catch your death<br> of cold, you hear me now?<br> That's so sad.<br> Ah.<br> Would you like<br> one of these?<br> Oh, thank ya,<br> honey.<br> Evelyn?<br> Honey,<br> we gotta get goin'.<br> The Braves' game's<br> fixin' to start...<br> and you're gonna miss<br> your... thing.<br> Excuse me.<br> That's my husband, Ed.<br> Hi, ma'am.<br> How you doin'?<br> Um,<br> I can't believe<br> Buddy died.<br> Neither could I.<br> Oh, well, I enjoyed<br> talkin' to you, honey.<br> What's your name?<br> Evelyn...<br> Evelyn Couch.<br> I've got to go. You come<br> back and see me, you hear?<br> Okay.<br> Bye-bye.<br> First of all, I want you...<br> to truly<br> dedicate yourselves...<br> to finding little ways to<br> putting that magic, that spark...<br> back into your marriage.<br> When we think of<br> romance and marriage,<br> what is the first thought that<br> comes into your mind? Divorce!<br> Remember when counselors used to tell<br> you to wrap yourself in cellophane...<br> to put a little charge<br> into your marriage?<br> Do we really pay<br> for these lectures?<br> You can see,<br> it is truly up to you...<br> to put romance back<br> into your relationship.<br> Oh, yeah<br> Da-na-na<br> da-na-na-na<br> As I walk this land<br> of broken dreams<br> I have visions<br> of many things<br> Happiness<br> Hi, honey.<br> Is just an illusion<br> Evelyn,<br> have you gone insane?<br> My God,<br> people can see you!<br> What if I had been<br> the paperboy?<br> Get in there!<br> What are you<br> thinking about?<br> Evelyn?<br> Evelyn!<br> Oh.<br> You know, what we really need<br> instead of this baloney...<br> is an assertiveness training<br> class for Southern women.<br> But that's a contradiction<br> in terms, isn't it?<br> Especially you, sweetheart.<br> You're livin' in the Dark Ages.<br> The roots of love<br> grow all around<br> But the leaves<br> they come tumblin'down<br> Every day, heartaches<br> grow a little stronger<br> I can't stand this pain<br> much longer<br> Hi, honey. I need one of those. Hi!<br> Mmm, you smell good too.<br> I need one of these.<br> Oh, this looks good! Uh-huh.<br> Yes, indeedy.<br> Always movin'<br> but goin'nowhere<br> Indistinct]<br> Ed.<br> Why don't you come in<br> and sit down at the table...<br> and have dinner with me? I'm<br> sorry. The game's almost over.<br> I just want to see a little bit<br> of it. Why you so dressed up?<br> Honey, don't get in the way.<br> Scoot over a bit.<br> Ed?<br> If I'd answered the door<br> wearing only cellophane,<br> would you still be<br> watching the baseball game?<br> No, honey. I'd probably be<br> checking you into a looney bin.<br> Hi, sugar.<br> How's my dumplin'?<br> Trick or treat!<br> You're not gonna throw<br> them hissy-fits, are you?<br> Happy Halloween!<br> Oh, no. No, no, no!<br> You're meaner than a damn snake.<br> I'm glad<br> you're feeling better.<br> Get back in bed. Good thing<br> your eyesight's failing.<br> Hey!<br> Mmm. Oh.<br> Hey. I was hopin' you'd be here.<br> My roommate, Mrs. Otis,<br> said I could visit her family,<br> but I said,<br> "Thank you kindly,<br> but I think I might have<br> my own visitor."<br> And here you are.<br> Well, sit down.<br> Thank you.<br> And doughnuts to boot!<br> You can't beat that.<br> Well, help yourself, Mrs.<br> Threadgoode. Thank you.<br> How's your friend?<br> Mrs. Otis?<br> Uh-huh.<br> Well, not so good.<br> Oh.<br> Looks like I won't be<br> gettin' home for quite a while,<br> and I sure miss it.<br> Funny what you miss<br> when you're away from home.<br> I miss<br> the smell of coffee...<br> and bacon fryin'.<br> Oh, what I wouldn't give for a<br> plate of fried green tomatoes...<br> like we used to have<br> at the cafe.<br> Ooh!<br> I never told you about the cafe, did I?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Oh, well...<br> now let me back up a bit.<br> You see, Idgie never<br> quite got over losing Buddy.<br> She hardly<br> ever come home.<br> Only Big George<br> knew how to find her.<br> She just didn't seem to care<br> about anythin'anymore.<br> Then, one summer day,<br> her mama sent for her.<br> Like they say,<br> God never shuts one door<br> without opening another.<br> That was also the day Idgie<br> met Frank Bennett, Mama!<br> The man whose murder<br> got her arrested.<br> Well, hello there, miss.<br> And who might you be?<br> Towanda to you.<br> Who are you?<br> Oh, Frank Bennett's<br> the name, Miss Towanda.<br> I must say you are lookin'<br> mighty fine today.<br> You a politician...<br> or does lying<br> just run in your family?<br> Mama!<br> Well, there you are!<br> Well, it's about time,<br> Idgie.<br> If you don't look like<br> the wild man of Borneo.<br> Here you go. Well, thank you.<br> Guess who's here?<br> Who?<br> Ruth. She's stayin'<br> with us this summer...<br> and will be in charge of all the young<br> people's activities at the church.<br> Is that why you wanted to see me?<br> We have so many things planned.<br> Ruth?<br> You remember my youngest<br> child? Of course I do.<br> Hi, Idgie.<br> Hi.<br> Maybe this isn't<br> such a good idea.<br> Oh, it's got to work.<br> Somebody's got to help her. I can't.<br> Are you sure you want<br> to go to this river club, Miss Ruth?<br> These ain't no<br> churchgoing folks.<br> I'll do just<br> fine, George, thank you.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> Is Idgie Threadgoode here<br> by any chance?<br> Come on in, honey.<br> She's right down here.<br> Here? Okay.<br> Uh-huh.<br> I'll see you,<br> Grady Kilgore,<br> and I'll<br> raise you twenty.<br> You ain't got nothin'!<br> Maybe I do and maybe I don't.<br> Put your money where<br> your mouth is, Mr. Sheriff.<br> Well, look what<br> the cat drug in!<br> I came to talk to you.<br> You're gonna have to wait.<br> I'm busy.<br> Come on, Grady, this is your<br> big chance.

I mean, if he's<br> dumb enough to come back here,<br> Grady and the Alabama boys<br> will take care of him.<br> If they don't,<br> I'll think of somethin'.<br> Don't take<br> any chances.<br> Promise me you won't do<br> anythin' crazy, no matter what.<br> Me?<br> Not me.<br> I'm gonna<br> put him down.<br> Hey, little Buddy.<br> That was the last<br> anyone saw of Frank Bennett...<br> until the night<br> of the town follies.<br> Ruth was away at one of the<br> Reverend Scroggins' many revivals.<br> One thing a woman<br> expects when she gets married...<br> is sympathy.<br> Haven't you got that<br> since you married me?<br> I sure have...<br> from the whole town.<br> Hey there! You got to come quick.<br> Well, the show<br> has hardly begun.<br> You got to come quick now.<br> You hear me?<br> Run, get help! Run,<br> quick! Where's the baby?<br> Never mind.<br> Excuse me, sir. I don't believe<br> you should be goin' anywhere...<br> with Ruth's baby.<br> Thank you.<br> Hi there. What can I do for you boys?<br> Idgie.<br> Grady.<br> This here is Sheriff<br> Curtis Smoote. Hi there.<br> He's over here from Georgia.<br> He's lookin' for a fella. Oh.<br> You recognize him?<br> No.<br> That's my husband, but I<br> haven't seen him in months.<br> I heard he got run over<br> by a Brinks armored truck.<br> What's he done?<br> Nothin' that we know of. We're tryin'<br> to find out what's been did to him.<br> He told his hired man he was<br> comin' to see his wife and baby,<br> but he ain't never<br> showed up back home.<br> Hell, I told him<br> if he showed up in this town,<br> we'd all have known.<br> Looks a little sissified<br> to me.<br> From what I hear,<br> most you boys in Georgia...<br> are a little light<br> on your feet.<br> That's the way<br> I heard it.<br> Could I interest you<br> in some pie?<br> No, ma'am, but that<br> barbecue sure smells good.<br> Best damn barbecue<br> in the state of Alabama.<br> Here you go.<br> That's your 4th one today.<br> I swear you're about<br> to eat up all my barbecue.<br> Sit down.<br> You ain't foolin' me,<br> girlie girl.<br> I know who you are.<br> I heard from Bennett's hired hand<br> that you threatened to kill Frank.<br> He ain't showed up<br> dead yet.<br> But if he does, you in a whole<br> mess of trouble. You understand?<br> What we talkin'about<br> is murder here.<br> Runnin'a foul of the law<br> and nobody gets away with that,<br> not even a bunch<br> of Alabama smart alecks.<br> If I find so much<br> as a hair of his head,<br> I'll arrest you faster<br> than you can slap a tick,<br> 'cause I'm the law,<br> and you can't beat the law.<br> Hey there.<br> Tell me what he said.<br> Smoote's? I told you.<br> He said...<br> that was the best damn<br> barbecue he ever had.<br> That's all?<br> No.<br> What else? He said the<br> pie was pretty good too.<br> You sure you ain't<br> never seen this man, boy?<br> Yes, sir, and I already<br> told ya, I ain't never seen him.<br> You'd do anything for<br> Miss Idgie, wouldn't ya, boy?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Would ya kill for her?<br> Did ya kill for her?<br> No, sir.<br> Well, now, maybe one of these<br> days you'll tell the truth.<br> Just remember, we hang<br> lyin' niggers in Georgia...<br> just as fast as<br> they do in Alabama.<br> Yes, sir, I remember.<br> Sorry.<br> What are ya doin' in<br> here? No milk in the house.<br> Where were you?<br> Takin' care of business,<br> havin' a good time.<br> I've been thinkin'<br> maybe I should move on...<br> because of Frank<br> and all.<br> I just don't want<br> you to feel like...<br> you have<br> to look out for us.<br> I just...<br> don't want to be selfish,<br> that's all.<br> Maybe if I wasn't here,<br> you'd settle down.<br> I'm as settled<br> as I ever hope to be.<br> Then... why can't you<br> tell me where you were?<br> I had a dream...<br> the other night.<br> I dreamt that<br> Buddy was gone.<br> I ran to his crib and there<br> he was, sleepin' like an angel.<br> You know,<br> I thanked God...<br> for lettin' me<br> still have Buddy.<br> And I remembered...<br> havin' the same reaction<br> after Frank would beat me,<br> thankin' the Lord for givin' me<br> the strength to take it.<br> And I remembered...<br> thankin' the Lord<br> for each day my mother lived,<br> even when she was<br> spittin' up blood...<br> and prayin' for me<br> to kill her.<br> I looked in my mother's eyes<br> pleadin'for me to help her...<br> and all I could do<br> was pray.<br> While you were gone,<br> as I was holdin' Buddy,<br> I thought if that bastard,<br> Frank Bennett...<br> ever tries<br> to take my child,<br> I won't pray.<br> I'll break his neck.<br> Ruth, you don't have to worry<br> about Frank Bennett anymore.<br> How can you say that?<br> It's his child too.<br> He won't give up<br> on his blood.<br> I'm only gonna<br> tell you this one time.<br> Frank Bennett won't<br> be bothering you no more.<br> Understand?<br> You killed him,<br> didn't you?<br> No!<br> You don't believe me.<br> Right now, I don't know<br> what to believe.<br> Believe me when I tell ya<br> I don't want ya to move out.<br> If I can help<br> Somebody<br> As I go<br> Finally.<br> Thanks, I've been<br> out here all day.<br> If I can show<br> Somebody<br> That they're travelin'<br> Travelin'wrong<br> Then my livin'<br> Hey...<br> Shall not<br> shall not be in vain<br> Excuse me.<br> I was waiting for that space.<br> Yeah? Tough! Face it, lady,<br> we're younger and faster.<br> Towanda.<br> Ha-ha-ha-ha!<br> Yeah!<br> Whooo!<br> Towanda!<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Whoooo!<br> Help, someone! What are<br> you doing? Are you crazy?<br> Face it, girls. I'm older,<br> and I have more insurance.<br> I never get mad, Mrs.<br> Threadgoode. Never!<br> The way I was raised<br> it was bad manners.<br> Well, I got mad<br> and it felt terrific.<br> I felt like I could beat<br> the shit outta all those punks!<br> Excuse my language.<br> Just beat 'em to a pulp!<br> Beat 'em till<br> they begged for mercy.<br> Towanda, the avenger!<br> After I wipe out<br> all the punks of this world,<br> I'll take on the wife beaters,<br> like Frank Bennett,<br> and machine gun<br> their genitals.<br> Towanda<br> will go on the rampage.<br> I'll put tiny bombs<br> in Penthouse and Playboy...<br> so they'll explode<br> when you open 'em.<br> I'll ban all fashion models<br> who weigh less than 130 pounds.<br> I'll give half the military<br> budget to people over 65...<br> and declare wrinkles<br> sexually desirable.<br> Towanda, righter of wrongs,<br> queen beyond compare!<br> How many of them<br> hormones you takin', honey?<br> Oh, when you give more<br> than you get<br> You're in danger<br> Well, honey,<br> what I can't<br> understand is...<br> how in the hell<br> you can hit someone...<br> six times<br> by accident.<br> Oh, Ed, don't make<br> such a big deal about it.<br> Who knows what evil lurks<br> within the hearts of men<br> When you find<br> that you're losin'<br> - What the hell is this?<br> - A low cholesterol meal.<br> Happy Valentine's.<br> That's danger and<br> heartbreak dead ahead<br> My God!<br> Are you tryin'to kill me?<br> If I was gonna kill ya,<br> I'd use my hands.<br> Stop in the<br> name of love<br> Before you<br> break my heart<br> Think it over<br> I'm worried about<br> my little friend Evelyn.<br> She said her husband...<br> will just be watching<br> his sports on TV...<br> and she has an urge to hit him<br> in the head with a baseball bat.<br> Hell, that<br> seems normal to me.<br> Hi, Janeen.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Mrs. Threadgoode, would<br> you like some crudites?<br> Thank you, but this raw stuff<br> don't sit good with me.<br> Mrs. Threadgoode, you<br> have to tell me something.<br> Did Idgie murder Frank Bennett<br> or not? Hold your horses, honey.<br> Where were we?<br> You didn't kill Ed,<br> did ya?<br> Not yet.<br> Oh, good.<br> Anyway, five years had passed<br> since Frank Bennett disappeared.<br> And Smokey Lonesome been<br> missin'ever since that same terrible night.<br> I 'member the day<br> when he showed up again.<br> My God, son,<br> you're the spittin'<br> image of Ruth.<br> Buddy Threadgoode, Jr.<br> Nice to meet you, sir.<br> Well, sir,<br> Smokey Lonesome.<br> Curtis Smoote was making one<br> of his visits to Whistle Stop, Alabama,<br> still huntin'and peckin'<br> for any scrap of evidence...<br> about Frank Bennett's<br> whereabouts.<br> Who wants to begin? Oh, I do.<br> I do, Miss Ruth.<br> Thank you.<br> We'll begin<br> on page five.<br> Life has a funny<br> way of working things out.<br> Well, hey there!<br> Smokey!<br> Idgie?<br> Smokey Lonesome!<br> If it isn't old home week.<br> How are you? Well, I'm<br> rattlin' but I'm rollin'.<br> What brings you to these<br> parts? Smell of good cookin'.<br> Hey, Smokey.<br> Sipsey. Let me fix you some lunch.<br> You know just about everybody<br> except Curtis Smoote.<br> He's the officer from<br> over at Valdosta, Georgia.<br> He's been lookin' for the same man for<br> almost 5 years. Very stubborn fella.<br> He loves our barbecue.<br> Mommy! Mommy!<br> Buddy.<br> Everybody<br> outta the way.<br> Give him here.<br> Let him go. I've got him.<br> Come on. You're<br> gonna be all right.<br> Open the door!<br> Put him in the<br> car. It's all right, honey.<br> I can understand...<br> having a funeral<br> for an arm.<br> I just don't know why she<br> insists on callin' him "Stump."<br> She say everybody<br> else gonna be callin'him that...<br> so we might just as well<br> be the first.<br> Okay, ice cream<br> and cake for everybody.<br> Go on.<br> My daddy always used to say there<br> was a separate God for children.<br> The good Lord was<br> watchin' over stump that day.<br> But then it started to rain<br> that month.<br> It rained and rained, and it<br> flooded parts of Whistle Stop.<br> That's why Grady's deputies stumbled<br> onto Frank Bennett's pickup truck,<br> and I just knew Idgie'd<br> never get out of this mess.<br> Now, you in or out? Remember,<br> I didn't take any cards.<br> Look at me and<br> let me see your face.<br> Idgie, I have to talk<br> to you. You're bluffin'.<br> Why don't you sit in? I'll deal<br> you a new hand. Gladys won't mind.<br> In private, Idgie.<br> Excuse us, Ruth.<br> A-ha. I'm just tryin' to teach<br> you not to fall for any tricks.<br> You're doin'<br> a great job.<br> What's your hurry?<br> And what is<br> so important?<br> What's that?<br> Somebody found Frank<br> Bennett's truck in the river.<br> What's that got<br> to do with me?<br> Officially, you and Big George<br> are under arrest for murder.<br> You're in my custody<br> until tomorrow.<br> I'm supposed to take you to<br> Georgia first thing in the morning.<br> Unless, of course...<br> Well, some people have<br> been known to pack up...<br> and sneak out of town<br> in the middle of the night.<br> What about Big George?<br> Well, the way<br> I figure it,<br> they'd be satisfied<br> if they had him.<br> Idgie,<br> this is serious.<br> We're talkin'<br> murder of a white man.<br> Someone's<br> gonna have to pay.<br> Nobody wants<br> to hang a woman.<br> No deal.<br> Idgie, I know how you feel<br> about Big George.<br> Hell, we all do.<br> But these just<br> the facts of life.<br> I can't do that.<br> Take me to jail<br> if you have to.<br> Well, that's what<br> I thought you'd say...<br> 'cause you're absolutely,<br> unconditionally,<br> positively the most stubborn<br> person I've known in my life.<br> Idgie and Big George went<br> to the county jail in Valdosta...<br> to await trial for<br> the murder of Frank Bennett.<br> They didn't have<br> to wait too long.<br> Did you know Frank Bennett? No, sir.<br> You mean, you<br> never met the man...<br> whose wife, Ruth, is your<br> business partner? That's right.<br> You never threatened to kill<br> Frank Bennett at his home...<br> in front of his hired man<br> in June of 1932?<br> The same Frank Bennett you did not<br> know. Oh, that was me, all right.<br> I thought you wanted to know if we'd<br> ever met... and the answer is no.<br> Um, I threatened<br> to kill him,<br> but we were never, what you<br> might say, properly introduced.<br> Is it not true that in September<br> of 1932 you came to Valdosta...<br> and took Frank Bennett's wife and<br> child back to Alabama with you?<br> Um... just the wife.<br> The child came later.<br> How much later? The usual. Nine months.<br> I suggest that you bribed...<br> this poor, weak woman with<br> promises of liquor and money,<br> and she lost control<br> of her senses momentarily.<br> When her husband came back<br> to get her and take her home,<br> you and your colored man<br> murdered him in cold blood.<br> No, sir.<br> Well, where were you on the<br> night of September 30, 1933?<br> I was at the town hall<br> doing a show.<br> And after that? I was<br> at my mother's house.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Who was with you?<br> Just Big George and myself. What about<br> your mother? Can she confirm that?<br> No, sir.<br> She died a year ago.<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> But do you expect 12 intelligent<br> men to believe you,<br> although one witness is dead and<br> the other is a colored man,<br> known to be a worthless,<br> no-good, lying nigger?<br> You expect these men<br> to take your word for it...<br> Just because<br> you say so?<br> That's right, you gump-faced,<br> blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!<br> One more outburst like that...<br> and I'll hold you in contempt<br> of court. You understand?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Oh, Lord.<br> Next witness.<br> Did you know<br> that you were pregnant...<br> at the time<br> you left Valdosta?<br> Yes.<br> And yet, you tell us<br> over and over...<br> that you went with this<br> woman... willingly?<br> Yes. I wouldn't raise<br> my child with Frank Bennett.<br> But why?<br> Did this woman promise you money? No.<br> A bigger home?<br> No. No.<br> Then tell us,<br> Mrs. Bennett,<br> why would a respectable<br> Christian woman...<br> go anywhere with this Idgie<br> Threadgoode... I object.<br> Whose reputation<br> is known far and wide...<br> as a notorious liar<br> and drunkard?<br> - Objection!<br> - Sustained!<br> Why did you leave...<br> with Idgie Threadgoode<br> that day?<br> Answer the<br> question, Mrs. Bennett.<br> Because she...<br> She's the best friend<br> I ever had,<br> and I love her.<br> Thank you, Mrs.<br> Bennett. That will be all.<br> The defense<br> calls as its last witness...<br> the Rev.<br> Herbert Scroggins.<br> Place your right hand<br> on the Bible, please.<br> I brought my own,<br> if you don't mind.<br> You swear to tell the whole<br> truth and nothing but the truth?<br> I do.<br> You have<br> information about the whereabouts...<br> of Idgie Threadgoode and her<br> colored man, known as Big George,<br> on the night<br> of September 30, 1933?<br> Yes, sir,<br> I do.<br> It has been<br> suggested here...<br> that she and her colored man<br> were at her mother's house.<br> Can you confirm that?<br> No, sir. That is a lie.<br> Oh, shit.<br> It has been my<br> habit to write all the dates...<br> of the activities of<br> the church in my Bible.<br> I show that the night<br> of September 30, 1933...<br> was the start of our<br> annual revival...<br> down at the<br> Baptist campground.<br> Sister Threadgoode<br> was there...<br> along with her hired man,<br> George Pullman,<br> who was in charge of the<br> barbecue as he has been...<br> for the last ten years.<br> Objection.<br> That doesn't mean anything. Murder could've<br> taken place any time the next couple of days.<br> Have you ever been to one of<br> our revivals, sir? Well, no.<br> Do you attend church<br> regularly, sir?<br> 'Course I do.<br> Good. Well, maybe if you<br> attended one of our revivals,<br> you'd know<br> they last three days...<br> and three nights,<br> Your Honor.<br> Approach the bench.<br> Percy, it don't look like<br> you got a case at all.<br> In the first place,<br> there's no body.<br> Second, we got us a preacher<br> nobody's gonna dispute.<br> But, Your Honor... I'm tellin' you.<br> What you got is a lot of nothing.<br> I say Frank<br> Bennett got himself drunk,<br> drove into the river and<br> was long ago eaten up...<br> and I don't give<br> a good goddamn!<br> What we got here is a<br> case of accidental death.<br> Case dismissed.<br> Whoo!<br> See you in church,<br> Sister?<br> Reverend.<br> I can't believe he<br> actually swore on a Bible.<br> Well, not really.<br> If that judge<br> had looked closer,<br> he'd have seen it was really<br> a copy of Moby Dick.<br> But why did he do it? For the sheer<br> joy of seeing you in church again...<br> which I suggested to him<br> might be your penance.<br> You didn't promise him,<br> did you? Yes, ma'am, I did.<br> And I never<br> break my word.<br> If I live 1,000 years,<br> I will never forgive you.<br> I don't know what's worse,<br> church or jail.<br> There now.<br> Don't you look pretty?<br> Oh, yes, honey.<br> You'll have me lookin' like<br> Ginger Rogers before you're done.<br> Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.<br> He's liable to go wild.<br> I'm glad to see<br> you're in a good mood.<br> You've slimmed down quite a bit<br> in the last few weeks.<br> I'm just so happy Big George<br> and Idgie got off.<br> I would have killed Frank<br> Bennett if I could've.<br> Did anybody really<br> think she did it?<br> Some said yes,<br> some said no.<br> 'Course the only one who really<br> knew was Frank Bennett.<br> And you know what they say.<br> Dead men tell no tales.<br> Towanda-a-a!<br> Evelyn, what in the hell<br> are you doing?<br> I need some light<br> and air.<br> Why don't you take one of<br> your walks or your jog...<br> or whatever it is<br> you do?<br> There's no dinner<br> either!<br> Ed, you have any idea why I've<br> been goin' to all these classes?<br> No. I've been trying<br> to save our marriage.<br> What's the point<br> of my tryin'...<br> if you're gonna sit on<br> your butt drinking beer...<br> and watching baseball,<br> basketball, football...<br> bowling and hockey<br> and golf...<br> and Challenge<br> of the Gladiators?<br> Mrs. Couch, I'm Sue,<br> Mrs. Otis'daughter-in-law.<br> How are you? I've heard about<br> you from Mrs. Threadgoode.<br> She is so sweet. She's been<br> lookin' after my mother-in-law.<br> Now, how is Mrs. Otis doin', by the way?<br> Much better, thank you. It takes<br> time getting used to a strange place.<br> I'm glad to hear it. Mrs.<br> Threadgoode's been anxious to get home.<br> Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode<br> doesn't have a house anymore.<br> They tore that down. What?<br> They had to. It was falling<br> apart, and it was condemned.<br> Oh, no.<br> Does she know that? No, well, we<br> didn't see any point in telling her.<br> It would just break her heart,<br> poor old thing.<br> But I am so glad<br> I got a chance to meet you.<br> You take care of yourself now.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Oh, Evelyn, hey!<br> Hey.<br> Do you like<br> my roses?<br> Since I can't get home<br> to look at my own roses...<br> I made myself<br> a paper garden.<br> Got everything but the<br> bugs. They're lovely.<br> You been here long?<br> Happy birthday!<br> Oh! I shouldn't have woken you up.<br> 'Course you should've. Don't you never let<br> me sleep through a visitor's day, honey.<br> I look forward to them all<br> week. So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.<br> Oh! I can't<br> believe you remembered.<br> You made me<br> fried green tomatoes!<br> Mmm!<br> They're delicious.<br> It's your recipe. Are they<br> cold? No. They're just the way...<br> we used to have 'em at<br> the Whistle Stop Cafe. Mmm!<br> You couldn't be sweeter to me<br> if you was my own daughter.<br> Here's your napkin.<br> And wait-wait-wait.<br> Queen, queen.<br> You know,<br> I don't feel 83.<br> It sorta slipped up on me.<br> I never expected<br> to live this long.<br> 'Course, the Lord takes us home<br> when he wants us.<br> Are you all right?<br> I was thinking<br> about Ruth.<br> After the trial<br> was over,<br> everything went back<br> to normal...<br> till that fall<br> when Ruth lost her appetite.<br> By the time Doc Hadley<br> looked at her,<br> he said the cancer was so bad<br> she only had a couple of weeks.<br> Well, we moved her<br> to the Threadgoode house...<br> and put her downstairs<br> so she'd be more comfortable.<br> Sipsey moved in with her<br> and never left her side.<br> Hold on, baby. I'm right here.<br> Idgie just prayed for a miracle.<br> Now, listen to me.<br> Make sure he graduates.<br> And don't... let him<br> come to the funeral.<br> I don't want him going<br> through that mess.<br> Would you quit talkin'<br> like that?<br> What funeral?<br> You're gonna be back on<br> your feet feelin' just fine...<br> in just a few days.<br> Just you wait.<br> Oh, what's the matter,<br> son?<br> Well,<br> let's go for a walk.<br> Did you get into a fight?<br> I got punched<br> in the nose.<br> I can't play<br> like everyone else.<br> Did I ever tell you the<br> story about... the oysters?<br> All the millions of'em<br> just lying around...<br> And God put sand in one of'em,<br> and it makes a pearl.

My favorite. Yeah.<br> I know.<br> Sometimes I even amaze myself.<br> What's the occasion?<br> Oh, honey, I just...<br> feel sorry about<br> the past few months.<br> I don't know what you're really<br> up to and what's going on with you,<br> but I guess I could've been more helpful<br> with your job and everything, you know.<br> Well, why are you...<br> puttin' up this wall<br> where you just tore one down?<br> Well...<br> I changed my mind.<br> I don't mean to seem<br> dense or anything,<br> but what's changed?<br> The air and the light.<br> Ed...<br> Hmm?<br> You remember how<br> you used to tell me...<br> you always wanted<br> two women in your house?<br> Oh, God.<br> Yeah.<br> Well...<br> what if I was<br> the younger of the two?<br> I don't believe<br> I get your drift.<br> I want something more than I've<br> ever wanted anything before.<br> I want to bring<br> Mrs. Threadgoode...<br> to our home.<br> I want her<br> to live here with us.<br> I want to give her the love<br> she's given me.<br> You're kiddin' me,<br> aren't you? I'm absolutely serious.<br> That's why I'm puttin' the<br> wall to Kyle's room back up.<br> Well, honey, this isn't<br> something you're just go and do.<br> I mean,<br> she's an old woman.<br> What if she got sick?<br> Who's gonna take care of her?<br> I will!<br> I can't leave her<br> in that place.<br> She's not a stray cat.<br> Hell, she isn't even family.<br> She's family to me.<br> Now, Evelyn.<br> Evelyn?<br> Honey?<br> Ah, look...<br> have you mentioned this<br> harebrained idea to her?<br> Not yet.<br> Well, good!<br> Then we'll just pretend<br> it never happened.<br> I'm making my own money.<br> I'll pay for everything.<br> You don't have to do<br> a thing.<br> Evelyn...<br> it's never<br> gonna happen.<br> So just forget<br> about it.<br> Don't you ever<br> say "never" to me.<br> Someone helped put a mirror<br> up in front of my face,<br> and I didn't like<br> what I saw one bit.<br> You know what I did?<br> I changed.<br> And that someone...<br> was Mrs. Threadgoode.<br> She needs my love and care,<br> and I'm gonna give it to her.<br> If you'll excuse me,<br> I have to go to the gym.<br> And if you won't listen<br> to reason...<br> there's always Towanda.<br> Hey, Nin...<br> What are you doing?<br> Those are her things,<br> Mrs. Threadgoode's things!<br> What are you doing in here?<br> Where's Mrs. Threadgoode? Who?<br> Mrs. Threadgoode! The woman<br> who lives here. Are you deaf?<br> I'm sorry, miss.<br> All they told me...<br> was that the woman who lived<br> in here died this morning.<br> Oh, my God!<br> Wha... What<br> are you sayin'?<br> She died early<br> this morning.<br> They were shorthanded so they asked<br> me to take all this stuff down.<br> That's all I know.<br> Stop that!<br> What is the matter<br> with you people?<br> Can't you wait a goddamn day,<br> for Chrissake?<br> Do you have no respect?<br> These are her things!<br> I'm sorry, but they told me to get<br> this room ready for another patient.<br> She may be just<br> another patient to you,<br> but she was my friend,<br> and I loved her. I'm sorry.<br> I'm just<br> following orders.<br> What is going on? Why<br> didn't you call me?<br> You could've called me before<br> you sent that idiot... I'm sorry.<br> It never occurred to me that<br> you would take it this hard.<br> I didn't even get to tell<br> her good-bye. Oh, I know.<br> These things are difficult, but<br> she died peacefully in her sleep.<br> To tell you the truth, I thought<br> you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.<br> Happy? Why, yes! This<br> is what she wanted.<br> What?<br> To be dead?<br> No, to go home.<br> You just missed her.<br> She left in a yellow cab<br> about a half hour ago.<br> I don't understand.<br> What? A cab?<br> She said there wasn't no reason for<br> her to stay now that Mrs. Otis had died.<br> Mrs...<br> Otis is dead?<br> Oh, Mrs. Otis died.<br> Mrs. Otis died!<br> Mrs. Otis!<br> Oh, God!<br> Not that... I'm glad that<br> Mrs. Otis died, it's just...<br> Oh, God,<br> I've gotta stop her.<br> Hey, Evelyn,<br> somebody stole my house.<br> It was right here<br> when I left.<br> Unless... Oh, Evelyn, you<br> don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?<br> It was here when I left.<br> No, honey, you're not crazy.<br> This is the place.<br> Why would anyone want to<br> steal an old lady's home?<br> Wasn't worth nothin'.<br> Oh, honey,<br> nobody stole it.<br> They had to tear it down.<br> It was condemned.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I shoulda told you.<br> Well, somebody<br> shoulda told me.<br> I'm old. I'm not a child. I'm sorry.<br> My husband Cleo and I<br> lived in this house...<br> for more than 40 years.<br> Now, it's... it's gone.<br> and all that's left of me...<br> is what's in this box, a<br> bunch of old cards and pictures.<br> Come on.<br> I'll take you home.<br> This is my home!<br> And now it's gone.<br> And Mrs. Otis<br> is gone.<br> I...<br> I don't quite<br> know what to do.<br> This is the first time I can remember<br> when I don't have a soul to look after.<br> You can come<br> look after me and Ed.<br> Oh, you're sweet,<br> but I think you're doin'<br> just fine on your own.<br> Don't you know you'd be<br> like a gift for us?<br> You're the reason<br> I get up every morning...<br> and that Mary Kay's<br> havin' such a good year...<br> and I don't look like some<br> blob from a horror movie.<br> Well, with a little help<br> from Idgie and Ruth.<br> Come on. I've got<br> your room all ready.<br> What does Ed say<br> about all this?<br> He'll learn<br> to love it.<br> Did I ever tell you that Mrs.<br> Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?<br> No, ma'am.<br> Yes, she was.<br> Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey<br> and me the night Sipsey died.<br> Sipsey told me a story that night<br> I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.<br> A story about<br> what really happened...<br> the night Frank Bennett<br> disappeared.<br> Hey there! You got to come quick.<br> The show has hardly begun. You<br> got to come quick. You hear me?<br> Run, get help! Run,<br> quick! Where's the baby?<br> Never mind.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> I don't believe you should be<br> goin' anywhere with Ruth's baby.<br> Like I said,<br> you ain't goin' nowhere.<br> Damn, you a thickheaded<br> son-of-a-bitch, ain't you?<br> I told you...<br> you ain't goin' nowheres<br> with Miss Ruth's baby.<br> Come on, angel.<br> Come on.<br> Come on, sweetheart.<br> It's all right.<br> Come on.<br> It's all right, baby.<br> It was self-defense.<br> I don't know why any white<br> jury would care why I did it.<br> Well, I saw it, and I can<br> testify. Excuse me here.<br> I don't mean<br> no offense here,<br> but I don't know who's less<br> likely to convince a jury,<br> my mama...<br> or Mr. Smokey.<br> No offense taken.<br> You're a good man,<br> Mr. Smokey.<br> You did good.<br> The sun's almost up.<br> George?<br> Mm-hmm?<br> I think...<br> it's hog-boiling time.<br> No, ma'am. It<br> ain't cold enough.<br> It's hog-boiling time.<br> Big George?<br> Uh-huh? When is that<br> barbecue gonna be ready?<br> It's gonna be ready<br> any time now.<br> Smells so damn good I just<br> can't wait to get me some.<br> Now, don't you forget to call<br> me when that's ready. All right.<br> Here you go.<br> Miss Idgie? Smokey left town. Yeah?<br> I thought it'd be best<br> under the circumstances.<br> He asked that<br> you tell Ruth good-bye.<br> Shame he had to go.<br> Hold on! I'm comin'.<br> What you want?<br> We want some barbecue.<br> Not today you don't.<br> Go on.<br> Why, this is about the<br> best barbecue I ever ate!<br> The secret's<br> in the sauce.<br> Sipsey?<br> My God!<br> That fryin' pan did more<br> than fry chicken that night.<br> Did Idgie really barbecue Frank<br> Bennett? Are you pullin' my leg?<br> Secret's in the sauce,<br> or so I've been told.<br> Now you know why<br> Idgie had to go on trial.<br> She knew the law would never<br> believe Sipsey. No!<br> Sipsey or Big George<br> or anyone else of color...<br> would've been hangin'<br> from the nearest tree.<br> To this day,<br> I'm still not sure...<br> whether Ruth<br> ever believed...<br> that Idgie didn't kill<br> Frank Bennett.<br> Truth's a funny thing<br> sometimes.<br> I feel better now.<br> Good.<br> I feel better 'cause<br> all these people'll live...<br> as long as<br> you remember 'em.<br> You reminded me...<br> about what the most<br> important thing in life is.<br> Do you know what I<br> think it is? No, ma'am.<br> Friends.<br> Best friends.<br> Oh, Ninny!<br> Look.<br> Oh!<br> Idgie?<br> Idgie's alive?<br> Oh, yes!<br> She's still out and about<br> charmin' bees and selling honey.<br> Sometimes I think<br> I catch a glimpse of her.<br> Maybe we'll<br> see her today.<br> Maybe.<br> Let's go.<br> After Ruth died and<br> the railroad stopped runnin',<br> the cafe shut down, and everybody<br> Just scattered to the winds.<br> It was never more than just<br> a little knockabout place.<br> But now that<br> I look back on it,<br> when that cafe closed...<br> the heart of the town<br> Just stopped beating.<br> It's funny how<br> a little place like this...<br> brought so<br> many people together.<br> I'll remember you<br> When I've forgotten<br> all the rest<br> You to me<br> were true<br> You to me<br> were the best<br> When there is no more<br> You cut to the core<br> Quicker than anyone<br> that I knew<br> Now when the<br> roses fade<br> I'm in the shade<br> baby<br> I'll remember you<br> Now listen<br> didn't I<br> Didn't I love you<br> Didn't I<br> didn't I care<br> Didn't I sleep<br> and didn't I weep beside you<br> With the rain that<br> was blowing in your hair<br> Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br> I'll remember you<br> When the wind blows<br> On through<br> the piney wood<br> It was you who came<br> right through for me, baby<br> It was you<br> who understood<br> Though I'd never say<br> That I turned the way<br> That you<br> have led me to<br> Darling, in the end<br> My dear sweet friend<br> I'll remember you<br> Yes, I will now<br> I'll remember you<br> Yes, I will now<br> I'll remember, remember<br> I'll remember<br> I will remember you<br> Yes, I will<br> Time ain't gonna<br> change nothin', baby<br> We can be halfway across<br> the world from each other<br> Don't make no difference<br> I'll remember<br> Every hour, every second<br> Every moment<br> that we had<br> We do it, we do it<br> We do it<br> don't do it<br> Gonna do it, do it<br> do it, do it, do it<br> I'll remember,<br> I'll remember<br> Oh, I'll remember you<br> I'll remember you<br> I'll remember you<br> Yes, I will<br>
