                        This is Samantha...<br> ... my mother's pet goose.<br> Mama loves her...<br> ... just like one of the family.<br> But I hate that bird.<br> And she hates me.<br> She's mean and sneaky.<br> And full of tricks.<br> It seems every First Day morning...<br> ... when we're ready to go to Meeting...<br> ... and I got on<br> my best Sunday clothes...<br> Samantha!<br> Thee old hisser!<br> I'll blow thee up with a cannon!<br> Some day I'll drown thee,<br> thee old squawker!<br> Little Jess!<br> What is thee saying, child?<br> Samantha tried to bite my legs off.<br> Next time, I'll throw her down the well.<br> Here, Samantha.<br> See, Little Jess?<br> Speak to her kindly.<br> She'll not bite thee.<br> She's a pure pet, Samantha is.<br> She's a snake on stilts!<br> I'll put her on the chopping block<br> and chop her head off.<br> Hush, hush!<br> Let's have no more talk of killing.<br> Run upstairs now and fetch thy brother<br> and sister. We'll be late for Meeting.<br> Blackberry pie?<br> Yes, blackberry pie.<br> No need to stick thy finger in it<br> to find out. No dilly-dallying!<br> Go fetch Mattie and Josh.<br> Well...<br> ...perhaps.<br> Well!<br> This afternoon?<br> All right!<br> What's thee talking to thyself for?<br> I'm not talking to myself.<br> Who's thee talking to then?<br> I don't see nobody.<br> Thee knows what happens<br> to eavesdroppers?<br> Their ears get long as a hound dog's!<br> Mama says to hurry.<br> I am, but I have to finish<br> my toilet-tee.<br> What's a toilet-tee?<br> Thee wouldn't know about it<br> because thee doesn't wash.<br> Please leave my boudoir.<br> "Please leave my boudoir."<br> Does thee...<br> Does thee think I'm pretty?<br> Thee's not ugly.<br> I guess thee's pretty...<br> ...for a girl.<br> Well, thank thee!<br> Thee's welcome.<br> Powie! I got Jeff Davis!<br> Powie! I got old Stonewall Jackson!<br> Powie! I got old Little Jess Birdwell!<br> Meet the real Stonewall Jackson...<br> ...and thee won't feel so feisty.<br> Get up.<br> What would thee do<br> if thee met Old Stonewall?<br> Mama said not to talk about the war.<br> Mama said for thee to hurry up.<br> She's the preacher.<br> Meeting can't start till she's there.<br> And anyway, Caleb Cope and me<br> are riding our horses to Meeting.<br> Thee old long arms!<br> Look! Pa's warming up Red Rover.<br> Where?<br> How a horse can look so fast<br> and move so slow beats me.<br> Thee can hitch him up, Enoch.<br> You got him nice and warm this morning.<br> Whoa, Mildred!<br> Hello there.<br> Guess I'm lost.<br> Must have got on the wrong road.<br> My! Quite a looker, that horse.<br> He's a looker, all right.<br> Maybe you can help me. I'm trying<br> to find that Methodist church.<br> Thy first turn's at the crossroads.<br> Bear right for three miles.<br> Is thee preaching there this morning?<br> - Who's preaching there?<br> - Thee?<br> - Who?<br> - Thee.<br> Me?<br> That's a dandy!<br> Son, I'm not a man of the cloth.<br> I sell organs.<br> Now, what in thunderation is all this<br> thee-ing and thou-ing about?<br> Bible talk to honor the Sabbath?<br> No, we talk that way weekdays too.<br> Excuse me, but it sounds mighty queer.<br> Who's "we"?<br> Quakers.<br> Quakers! Have you folks<br> got a church around here?<br> Yes, we call it a Meeting House.<br> It's just beyond the Methodist Church.<br> Hast thou an organ in thine<br> Meeting House, friend?<br> We don't hold with music playing.<br> What, no organ?<br> Dear me! Why, a church<br> without an organ...<br> ...is like a tree without a bird.<br> Wait till I talk<br> to that minister of yours.<br> He'll never be content<br> until he buys an organ.<br> I wish thee luck with the preacher.<br> That's three miles over, take<br> the main road, turn right. I got it.<br> Thank you.<br> Thee.<br> Get up!<br> Now look, Mildred...<br> ...there is a horse!<br> - I'm going by Caleb's, Pa.<br> - All right, son.<br> Red Rover, that man<br> paid thee a compliment.<br> If he only knew.<br> Listen, Red, just don't slow down...<br> ...when thee hears Sam Jordan<br> coming behind us...<br> ...and, by sugar, we'll stay<br> out in front today.<br> - Thee say something, Jess?<br> - I was just soothing Red Rover.<br> If thee talked as much to the Almighty<br> as thee does to that horse...<br> ...thee might stand more squarely<br> in the light.<br> Sounds like thy sermon's<br> already begun, Eliza.<br> Why, Jess!<br> I thought thee liked my preaching.<br> Now, Eliza, thee has the prettiest<br> pulpit voice I ever heard.<br> And thee says the truest words.<br> Especially during Silent Meeting?<br> And this morning,<br> thee looks like a girl.<br> Where's Little Jess? Mattie!<br> I'm coming, Mama.<br> Made the stockade in the nick of time.<br> - Goodbye, folks.<br> - Goodbye, Enoch.<br> Good luck, Mr. Birdwell.<br> Why does Enoch wish thee good luck<br> every First Day morning?<br> I guess it's because he...<br> He wishes me luck!<br> Hey, Papa, look!<br> It's thy friend, Sam Jordon, Jess.<br> No need to look. I can feel him.<br> Gard's with him!<br> Mattie, Little Jess, stop craning<br> thy necks at the Jordans.<br> It isn't seemly.<br> Yes, Mama.<br> Sure are a-coming.<br> Thee's not urging thy horse?<br> Not urging. Just encouraging a mite.<br> Come on, Red Rover!<br> Sit down!<br> Come on, Prince!<br> Come on, lazybones!<br> Come on, Prince! Good boy!<br> What's gotten into thee?<br> Morning, Mattie.<br> Morning, Eliza.<br> Good morning, Jess.<br> - Come on, Papa!<br> - Come on, Prince!<br> Come back, come back!<br> Mama!<br> Little Jess, let go!<br> Come on, Prince!<br> Gard winked at Mattie.<br> He did not!<br> I saw him.<br> Gard wouldn't do such a vulgar thing!<br> I hope nobody saw us.<br> Me too.<br> I want to come to Meeting with nothing<br> in my heart but peace and love.<br> Thee gives me a pain.<br> One eternal day<br> There, God the Son<br> Forever reigns<br> And scatters night away<br> Filled with delight<br> My raptured soul<br> Would here no longer stay<br> Though Jordan's waves around me roll<br> Fearless I'd launch away<br> Last week...<br> ...I had my 80th birthday.<br> And I'd like to bear witness<br> to Proverbs.<br> First chapter...<br> ...33rd verse.<br> "Who so harkeneth unto Me...<br> ...shall dwell safely...<br> ...and shall be quiet<br> from fear of evil."<br> Amen, Emma. Amen.<br> I ask the prayers of everyone here<br> to help me be less worldly...<br> ...less concerned about my appearance...<br> ...to mind my tongue...<br> ...and especially have the strength<br> not to wear earrings.<br> I've never spoken in Meeting before...<br> ...but I feel so happy this morning<br> I'd like to share my happiness...<br> ...with everyone in the whole world.<br> And to thank our Heavenly Father.<br> God is love!<br> - Is this it?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Won't thee come in, friend?<br> Thank you.<br> You're the minister of this meeting?<br> I am. One of them.<br> My name is Major Harvey.<br> - Won't thee sit down, friend?<br> - Thank you, no.<br> I've had the duty placed upon me of<br> speaking to you Quakers about the war.<br> It is a matter much on our minds...<br> ...and in our prayers.<br> But your men don't fight in it.<br> Some have.<br> But you do not encourage them.<br> We do not encourage them.<br> Ma'am, the Union has endured<br> two years of bloody civil war.<br> Thousands have given their lives in<br> battle to free our country from slavery.<br> We are opposed to slavery.<br> But we do not believe it right<br> to kill one man to free another.<br> Ma'am, it's not going to be a question<br> of fighting for freedom or a principle...<br> ...but of protecting our own towns,<br> our own homes, from attack.<br> Would you men stand by while others<br> die to protect you?<br> You look like a boy who could give a<br> good account of himself.<br> I've been tempted to fight.<br> I guess the Good Lord knows why.<br> I mean, sometimes I get the<br> sinful wish to get into a scrap.<br> So I got to watch myself<br> closer than most people.<br> So I'll just stay away from the war.<br> Because if I ever got into it,<br> I'd be a goner.<br> And you, son?<br> Are you ready to put up with looting<br> and killing without lifting a finger?<br> Are you afraid to fight?<br> I don't know.<br> Here, at last, is an honest answer.<br> I don't wish to offend...<br> ...but how many of you are hiding<br> behind your church to save your skins?<br> Is it right to let others fight for you?<br> To protect your lives and your property?<br> Why don't you speak up?<br> I'll speak up.<br> Nothing could ever induce me<br> to bear arms against my fellow man.<br> Burn my house!<br> Destroy my crops! Attack my family!<br> And I declare to all...<br> ...especially to thee, Josh Birdwell,<br> wavering in thy convictions...<br> ...nothing can move me to violence!<br> Nothing!<br> It seems Friend Purdy has already<br> been moved to considerable violence.<br> I misdoubt any of us here<br> could say with surety...<br> ...what we would do in case of attack.<br> I have my doubts as to the strength<br> of thy convictions too.<br> I have my own doubts.<br> I've often asked myself...<br> ...what I would do if I saw<br> my family endangered...<br> ...my wife and children threatened.<br> If the test comes, all I can say is...<br> ...I hope and pray I can be an<br> instrument of the Lord.<br> That test is coming.<br> It may well be so, friend.<br> Let us pray that the will of God<br> be revealed to us...<br> ...and we be given the strength<br> and grace to follow His will.<br> Lord...<br> ...let Thy children partake of Thy love<br> and the love of all men...<br> ...rendering not evil for evil,<br> nor violence for violence done.<br> Let swords be changed into<br> ploughshares...<br> ...and spears into pruning hooks...<br> ...and children of peace<br> learn war no more...<br> ...forever.<br> Eliza, what does thee like about<br> that shifty-eyed bird?<br> Why, Jess!<br> She marches along so lordly-like.<br> Marched real lordly through two pecks<br> of young strawberries this morning.<br> - Hello, Gard.<br> - Hello, Josh.<br> - You home on leave?<br> - Got a week's furlough.<br> Hello, Little Jess, Mrs. Birdwell.<br> Hello, Mr. Birdwell.<br> I came over to apologize about<br> that little brush last Sunday.<br> It wasn't my idea.<br> We know that.<br> Jess is going to get a nice slow horse<br> that doesn't have any racing ideas.<br> Did thee shoot any rebs?<br> What are they like?<br> They're just people like us.<br> But did thee shoot any?<br> Let's have no more talk of war...<br> ...and killing.<br> I'm sorry, ma'am.<br> - Come in and set.<br> - Thank you.<br> You folks going to the fair?<br> I used to like the fair...<br> ...but it's come to be<br> no place for us.<br> They've got some fine exhibits.<br> Needlework, livestock, poultry.<br> And geese.<br> Eliza, it might be just the place<br> to pick us up a nice slow horse.<br> Thee go, Jess. The fair's come to have<br> so many sideshows, freaks, dancing...<br> Dancing?<br> What does thee know about dancing?<br> She knows a thing or two.<br> Did Mama ever dance?<br> That was 20 years ago.<br> Twenty years exactly, come October.<br> I was courting her.<br> But did Mama dance?<br> No, child.<br> She was tempted to lift a foot,<br> but she married me instead.<br> Did thee propose then and there?<br> Dinner's ready.<br> Stay and eat with us?<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> I'd be pleased to.<br> What about the fair?<br> - Come on, Josh, Jess.<br> - Can we go, Papa?<br> There's no point in putting temptation<br> in the children's paths.<br> We'd resist it.<br> We'd resist it as well as thee did.<br> Why can't we go?<br> She'll never let us go.<br> Mama's so straight-laced!<br> Maybe I can loosen up a few laces.<br> Isn't it ghastly, ladies and gentlemen?<br> Isn't it horrible?<br> This shining blade,<br> with the razor-edged blade...<br> ...will pass through his mouth,<br> through his throat...<br> ...into his very vitals!<br> And here we have Flame-o...<br> ...the Human Volcano!<br> Do not deprive your children<br> of this educational act.<br> Let's get away from here.<br> - I promised Caleb I'd meet him.<br> - Mattie, look at the quilting with me.<br> Thee wants to see quilts, Josh wants to<br> meet Caleb, and I want to see livestock.<br> Let's meet...<br> ...over here by the harvesting machine<br> in one hour.<br> Thee stay with me.<br> Oh, Josh.<br> There's a rock exhibit I think<br> thee and Caleb might find edifying.<br> - Rocks?<br> - Come along.<br> I'm hungry. I want some candy.<br> Thee's had thy breakfast. Come along.<br> I'm thirsty.<br> You shoot that squirrel down<br> three times, you get a beautiful prize.<br> It's a hit!<br> How's that?<br> Got him.<br> Howdy, Mr. Birdwell.<br> Say, you're an old squirrel-shooter.<br> I'll treat you.<br> Give that man a rifle.<br> Another marksman here.<br> That squirrel sits so still<br> he makes me nervous.<br> Never mind the comments, just hit...<br> He did hit the squirrel!<br> Where's Mattie?<br> They're over by the quilting booth.<br> See you later.<br> Thanks, Gard.<br> Folks, the man's about to shoot...<br> He hit it again!<br> Thee wait right here.<br> You won yourself one of these<br> beautiful prizes here.<br> One of these beautiful pri...<br> One of these beautiful prizes.<br> Them prizes was made and manufactured...<br> ...by Pierre of Paris, France.<br> You heard of him?<br> I ain't either. The man's having a<br> hard time to make up his mind here.<br> For Eliza?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Wait!<br> You won it fair and square.<br> I insist you take them, friend.<br> There! Pair of garters<br> for your wife to wear!<br> Or your sweetheart!<br> Just as soon as you get out of mourning.<br> Come on.<br> I want to show you something.<br> How about a demonstration?<br> I'd just be delighted.<br> Delighted. Step right in, gentlemen.<br> Nothing would please me more.<br> Low bridge.<br> Well, Mr. Birdwell, come right in.<br> Gentlemen, welcome to my organatorium.<br> Just make yourself at home.<br> A temple of temptations,<br> full of instruments of the devil.<br> Gentlemen, I'd like you to take<br> a look at this magnificent instrument.<br> Now, isn't that a beauty?<br> Just as smooth as silk,<br> and as fine as frog's hair.<br> I'll pay two to one if you guess<br> the shell which contains the pea.<br> Take your chin off the board.<br> You'll tip it.<br> As you see, there's nothing here,<br> nothing here.<br> The pea's there,<br> and I put the shell over it.<br> Now, we move the shells.<br> Watch very closely.<br> Now where is the elusive little pea?<br> Boy...<br> ...will you go away?<br> Forty-eight reeds,<br> plus the tuba miraballis.<br> How many stops?<br> So you know organs!<br> It has eight stops<br> and this vox humana.<br> Cries like a baby, sighs like a woman.<br> I'm partial to music, but I'm a Quaker<br> and they're against music.<br> The Quaker!<br> Why, certainly I remember distinctly.<br> Thee, thy, thou...<br> Of course.<br> But I want you to know, sir,<br> I honor your prejudices...<br> ...convictions.<br> Boys, let me tell you...<br> ...there are two kinds of music just the<br> same as there are two kinds of women:<br> The uplifting kind and the...<br> Now, here.<br> You take the banjo. Now, there.<br> There is an instrument that stirs up<br> a man's worst passions.<br> Speech!<br> Speech, ma'am!<br> Thank thee kindly.<br> Watch very closely. We go again.<br> Beware of the owl<br> Who's waiting to howl<br> Especially beware of the crow<br> Of the...<br> ... crow<br> Oh, fellows!<br> By George!

How many times<br> does thee think I've done that?<br> I don't know.<br> I understand thy being carried away.<br> But our ways are ways of peace.<br> And thee loves peaceful ways.<br> I do.<br> If thee turns thy back on everything<br> I've taught thee and prayed for...<br> ...thee turns thy back on me.<br> No, Mother, not on thee.<br> Yes, son.<br> On me.<br> But I have to do what's right.<br> Thee will, son.<br> God will give thee the strength.<br> Dear God in heaven,<br> watch over Joshua.<br> Make him a witness<br> for the peace on earth...<br> ...for which Thy Son died.<br> In His name do I ask it.<br> Amen.<br> Before thee sleeps,<br> promise me thee'll pray.<br> I promise.<br> Good night, son.<br> I have faith in thee.<br> Thee promised...<br> ...to pray.<br> I prayed.<br> Goodbye, Father.<br> Goodbye, son.<br> God bless thee.<br> My boy!<br> God keep thee.<br> Company, halt!<br> This is the only shallow spot.<br> They have to cross here.<br> All right, men.

Fast!<br> Jam a log between those trees!<br> Get something solid in front of you.<br> That won't stop a bullet.<br> You hold your gun that tight,<br> by the time the rebs get here...<br> ...your trigger finger will be numb.<br> Who gave that rebel yell?<br> I did, sir.<br> Do it again and I'll shoot you!<br> And the same goes for<br> any other man here!<br> Chopping wood?<br> We burn wood every winter, Purdy.<br> Pretty soon thee'll have no house<br> to burn wood in.<br> Some of Morgan's thieving men<br> burnt my barn...<br> ...stole my horses<br> and cleaned out my smokehouse.<br> I'm sorry to hear that.<br> Thee is welcome to anything I've got.<br> No, thanks. If thee wants to help...<br> ...pick up a gun and fight...<br> ...the same as I'm doing.<br> I'm not ready to do that.<br> What does thee aim to do?<br> Sit here and turn the other cheek?<br> That's what I aim to do...<br> ...if I can.<br> Thee's got to face the fact that wartime<br> calls for another kind of thinking.<br> Your thinking may have changed,<br> but you haven't.<br> Last week, you told my son<br> he'd go to hell for fighting.<br> This week you tell Jess to fight.<br> Whatever's right for Purdy's got<br> to be right for everybody else?<br> If you're so hell-bent to fight,<br> get going!<br> If it's peace thee wants, Jess Birdwell,<br> thee won't get it chopping wood.<br> Did they hurt thy place?<br> No, Jess.<br> Just thought I'd ride toward the river,<br> see how the boys are getting on.<br> One more man at the fort<br> won't make a hoot of difference.<br> If there's any fighting to be done,<br> I'll do it for both of us.<br> I'd like to see someone hold out<br> for a better way of settling things.<br> They're coming!<br> What was that all about?<br> Get down.<br> You'll find out sooner than you think.<br> Fire!<br> It's Lady!<br> Look, Papa!<br> Is Josh hurt?<br> Bring Lady to the house.<br> Jess, no!<br> Little Jess, thee's the man<br> on the place now.<br> Kill a Johnny Reb for me.<br> Never talk that way<br> about a man's life.<br> Mama, look!<br> They're rebs, they're rebs!<br> Gentlemen!<br> Gentlemen!<br> Would thee like some food?<br> There's meat in the<br> smokehouse by the barn.<br> Right.
