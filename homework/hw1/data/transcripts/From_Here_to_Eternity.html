Hello!<br> Hiya, Prew.<br> What are you doing over here?<br> Transferred over from Fort Shafter.<br> - You quit the Bugle Corps?<br> - Yep.<br> - For here?<br> - I didn't pick it.<br> Oh, you made a very bad mistake.<br> This outfit, they can give back<br> to General Custer.<br> Yeah?<br> Captain ain't in yet.<br> I'll look around.<br> What do you think you're doin'?<br> - What's your name?<br> - Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.<br> I heard about you.<br> I heard about you, too, Sergeant.<br> This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.<br> You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself<br> before sundown.<br> Put up your cue and come along.<br> Grand went to the hospital yesterday.<br> Did you put him in the sick book?<br> - Did you make out the morning report?<br> - I didn't have time, Sergeant.<br> You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.<br> Those medics didn't bring back<br> the sick book till late yesterday.<br> - I'll tend to it right now.<br> - Thanks. I already done it for you.<br> You're the best bugler<br> they got over at Shafter.<br> You're the best bugler<br> they got on this whole island.<br> That's true.<br> I feel for you, pal.<br> But from my position,<br> I can't quite reach you.<br> Ten-hut!<br> - At ease.<br> - Morning, sir.<br> Morning, men. Anything special for me<br> this morning, Sergeant Warden?<br> - I've only a few minutes.<br> - Yes, sir. New man here.<br> Oh, yes. Come in.<br> Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.<br> Reporting to the company<br> commander, as ordered.<br> At ease. Where's that service record?<br> Born in Kentucky, enlisted<br> first at Fort Myer, Virginia.<br> "Bugle Corps, First Bugler."<br> Prewitt, I always make it a policy<br> to talk to my new men.<br> Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.<br> If I like a soldier,<br> he can get to be a noncommissioned officer<br> quicker here than anywhere else.<br> But he has to show me that<br> he's got it on the ball.<br> What kind of trouble were<br> you in in the Bugle Corps?<br> - No trouble, sir.<br> - What made you transfer out then?<br> It was a personal matter.<br> - Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?<br> - Why, yes, sir.<br> Prewitt, you was a corporal<br> in the Bugle Corps.<br> You took a bust to buck private<br> to transfer to an infantry outfit.<br> Why? Because you like to hike?<br> Or was it because<br> you couldn't stand to bugle?<br> It was a personal matter.<br> That's up to the company commander<br> to decide.<br> Well?<br> I was First Bugler for two years.<br> The topkick had a friend<br> who transferred in from another outfit.<br> The next day, he was made<br> First Bugler over me.<br> I was a better bugler.<br> And you asked out on account of that?<br> Maybe it ain't sensible,<br> but that's the reason.<br> His feelings were hurt.<br> Kids they send us now!<br> Well, we'll get your stripes back for you,<br> maybe an extra one for good measure.<br> Do you know why you were assigned<br> to "G" Company?<br> No, sir.<br> I pulled a few strings.<br> I'm the regimental boxing coach, you know.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl<br> year before last.<br> - You should have won it.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Our regiment got beaten<br> in the finals last December,<br> but I mean to win this year.<br> All I've needed was a top middleweight.<br> I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.<br> Quit fighting? When? What for?<br> Well, over a year ago.<br> Maybe you heard about<br> what happened with Dixie Wells?<br> You mean that fellow that got hurt?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Yes, I heard about that.<br> It's too bad. I can understand how you feel.<br> But those things happen.<br> That's why I decided I would quit, sir.<br> You might as well say stop war<br> because one man got killed.<br> Our fighting program is<br> the best morale builder we have.<br> I've got a mighty sour company bugler.<br> - How'd you like the job?<br> - Not if it means fighting.<br> Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire<br> a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt.<br> You should know that in the army<br> it's not the individual that counts.<br> Well, you'll find that we won't put<br> any pressure on you in my outfit.<br> Just don't make any mistakes in it,<br> that's all.<br> I've got to go into town.<br> Anything else for me today, Sergeant?<br> The company fund report has got<br> to be made out, it's due tomorrow.<br> - You make it out. Is that all?<br> - No, sir.<br> Well, whatever it is, you fix it up.<br> If there's anything that has<br> to go in this afternoon, sign my name.<br> - I won't be back.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He'd strangle in his own spit<br> if he didn't have me around here<br> to swab his throat out for him.<br> Come on.<br> You been in the army what now, Prewitt?<br> Five years? Five and a half?<br> Yeah.<br> Don't you think it's about time<br> you got smart?<br> You know what you did just now<br> when you turned down Dynamite Holmes?<br> You put your head in a noose.<br> Things are softer for a boxer in this outfit.<br> Otherwise,<br> you'd better know how to soldier.<br> - I can soldier with any man.<br> This place is gettin' to be like<br> the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.<br> Who is that?<br> She's Captain Holmes' wife.<br> You'll fight, Prewitt.<br> You'll fight because Captain Holmes<br> wants to be Major Holmes.<br> He's got an idea he'll make it<br> if he gets a winning team.<br> And if you don't do it for him,<br> you'll do it for me.<br> 'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?<br> The more he's happy, the less he bothers me<br> and the better I run this company.<br> So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?<br> I know where I stand.<br> A man don't go his own way, he's nothing.<br> Maybe back in the days of the pioneers<br> a man could go his own way,<br> but today you've gotta play ball.<br> Leva!<br> Can't I once walk up to the supply room<br> and find you working with both hands?<br> I can't do no better<br> on what you people pay me!<br> Draw this man some supplies.<br> "G" Company squad room's on the top floor.<br> Get rid of your bags and come back here.<br> Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.<br> Save you making four or five trips.<br> - Thanks.<br> - I just hate to see energy wasted.<br> Besides, you'll be needing yours.<br> Looks like a good man.<br> I know his type. He's a hardhead.<br> Her and them sweaters.<br> I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.<br> Not her, Top.<br> She knows the score like I been tellin' you.<br> - Is that right?<br> - Listen, not around here.<br> But when I soldiered<br> at Fort Bliss with Holmes,<br> I heard plenty about this lady, plenty.<br> - You did, huh?<br> - Okay, not me.<br> But I know some of the guys<br> she played around with, so don't tell me.<br> I ain't tellin' you. You're tellin' me.<br> - Good morning, Sergeant.<br> - Morning, ma'am.<br> I'm looking for my husband.<br> Captain Holmes just went into town, ma'am,<br> on business.<br> He was to have left some things for me.<br> Do you know anything about them?<br> No, I don't, ma'am.<br> Anything I can do for you?<br> No, thanks.<br> I'd be glad to help, ma'am.<br> My husband's been telling me<br> a lot about you, Sergeant.<br> - He says you're very efficient.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> What is it that makes you<br> so efficient, Sergeant?<br> I was born smart, ma'am.<br> I love that. Well, goodbye, Sergeant.<br> Man, she sure is one, ain't she?<br> - One what?<br> - One woman.<br> I've seen better.<br> Karen? Karen?<br> - Sorry I'm late.<br> - It doesn't matter.<br> I got tied up with General Slater.<br> - I bumped into him in the Officer's Club.<br> - Yeah?<br> - What did the General have to say?<br> - Success, he said.<br> Success in war, success in peace time.<br> And not a word about my promotion.<br> Sometimes I think<br> the old man's just waiting to ship me down.<br> Well, if you'd spend less time<br> buttering generals<br> and more time with your company,<br> you'd get that promotion.<br> The company takes care of itself.<br> I went over there today, looking for you.<br> I had some business<br> to attend to at Kaneohe.<br> That was all right, wasn't it?<br> Of course.<br> I have no right to inquire into your actions.<br> - That was our agreement.<br> - Then why bring it up?<br> Because I wanted you to know I'm not<br> as stupid as you maintain all women are.<br> Now, just what does that mean?<br> - What are you accusing me of now?<br> - Of nothing.<br> It's no longer any of my business<br> how many women you go out with, is it?<br> But I wish you could<br> just be honest about it once.<br> There's no reason I should try<br> to hide anything, is there?<br> The way things are between us now,<br> what right have you<br> to always be accusing me?<br> What right?<br> Are you going back to that again?<br> How long will it be, I wonder,<br> before I'm allowed to live that down?<br> How many times do I have to tell you<br> it was an accident?<br> Please, Dana. I'm going to bed.<br> Please get out of my bedroom.<br> Captain Holmes says you don't want<br> to come out and fight for us.<br> That's right.<br> We thought we'd buy you a beer<br> and talk it over.<br> We're the company boxers.<br> I figured.<br> Man, what I would not give<br> to have this character<br> in the corner pool room in my hometown.<br> Box as good as you used to,<br> we'd be a cinch this year.<br> You ain't forget, division champs<br> get 10-day furloughs, did you, son?<br> I'm Ike Galovitch,<br> platoon guide of your platoon.<br> And don't think you're a tough guy,<br> Prewitt.<br> You no talk now, but out in the field with us<br> you sing different song.<br> Listen, the guy don't have to fight if he<br> don't want to without gettin' kicked around.<br> Now, we're playing pool.<br> Why don't you take off?<br> - You want busted head, Maggio?<br> - No.<br> Then keep your big nose out altogether.<br> Training season starts next week.<br> You can pick up your stuff...<br> Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you.<br> I ain't fightin'. I quit fightin'.<br> You guys want to put the screws on,<br> go right ahead!<br> - I can take anything you can dish out.<br> - Okay, Prewitt.<br> Thanks.<br> I just hate to see a good guy<br> get it in the gut.<br> You better get used to it, kid.<br> You'll probably see a lot of it before you die.<br> You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?<br> Do you know anything<br> in army regulations says I gotta box?<br> Every boxer in this outfit's a noncom.<br> I guess you've never seen a bunch of 'em<br> get together and give a man the treatment.<br> What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.<br> She's still too young for you.<br> Now, listen, Warden, I'm a better man<br> than you any day, and don't forget it.<br> I won't forget it.<br> What's the deal with him, anyway?<br> With Warden. I don't figure him.<br> Warden?<br> He ain't like the others.<br> He'll make it tough on you.<br> But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,<br> and he won't come over it.<br> You don't see many<br> topkicks like him no more.<br> He was with the 15th in Shanghai<br> when they saw their action.<br> I heard about it<br> down in the Philippines even.<br> All I know is,<br> he's the best soldier I ever saw.<br> Hut! Hut! Hut, two, three, four!<br> Hut! Hut!<br> Count, keep count!<br> One, two, three, four!<br> One, two, three, four!<br> Prewitt! Get in step, Prewitt!<br> Hut! Hut!<br> Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic.<br> Get in step!<br> Hut! Hut! Hut!<br> Platoon halt!<br> Order arms!<br> Left face!<br> Prewitt, one step forward march.<br> Prewitt, you march<br> like a drunken gooney bird.<br> I gotta teach you how to drill.<br> You stay here.<br> Platoon dismissed!<br> Detail, right face!<br> Trail forward, march!<br> Half left, march!<br> Half right, march!<br> Right flank, march!<br> Left flank, march!<br> To the rear, march! One, two, three!<br> To the rear, march!<br> Rear, march! Rear, march!<br> Rear, march! Rear, march!<br> Rear, march! Rear, march!<br> Assemble your weapons. All right, start.<br> A rifle's your best friend.<br> In case it jams in combat,<br> it could mean life or death.<br> So you gotta learn to strip 'em down<br> and put 'em back together again blindfolded.<br> Your rear sight's way off.<br> You'd be 50 feet off target at 300 yards.<br> Now, that's what happens when a soldier<br> don't know how to assemble his rifle.<br> Seven laps around the track, double time,<br> and keep this rifle at high port.<br> Forward thrust, hold!<br> Draw and recover, hold!<br> Arm thrust, hold!<br> Draw and recover, hold!<br> And rest!<br> Wide open, huh, Prewitt?<br> Maybe seven more laps will teach you<br> to watch yourself.<br> Are you crazy? I saw what you did!<br> I'm tellin' you, Top,<br> she's nothin' but trouble.<br> You better keep your mind<br> off what you're thinking.<br> What do you wanna do,<br> wind up in Leavenworth?<br> I won't be back in time<br> to take retreat, Sergeant.<br> - Or reveille, either.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> All work and no play, Sergeant.<br> All you do is sit around<br> sweating over papers.<br> There are other things<br> in the world besides work.<br> - You ought to get out more yourself, Warden.<br> - I've been considering it.<br> Well, I'm going.<br> I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.<br> It'll be here when you get back, sir.<br> Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.<br> You'd better step inside,<br> or you'll get wet.<br> I am wet.<br> If you're looking for the captain,<br> he isn't here.<br> And if I'm not looking for him?<br> He still isn't here.<br> Well, I'm looking for him.<br> Do you know where he is?<br> I haven't the slightest idea.<br> Perhaps he's "in town on business."<br> That's the way you put it<br> the other day, isn't it?<br> I got some papers<br> it's important for him to sign.<br> I'll try phoning him at the club.<br> Maybe he's there.<br> Don't do that.<br> I never like to disturb<br> a man when he's drinking.<br> I could use a drink myself.<br> Aren't you gonna ask me in?<br> The liquor's there, Sergeant,<br> in the cabinet.<br> You're taking an awful chance, you know.<br> My maid is liable to be home any time.<br> No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.<br> You think of everything,<br> don't you, Sergeant?<br> I try. In my position, you have to.<br> Are these really important?<br> Yes. But not important to get signed today.<br> Tomorrow's okay.<br> I got copies at the office,<br> so it won't be much work to fix them up.<br> That's what I like about you, Sergeant.<br> You have confidence.<br> It's also what I dislike about you.<br> It's not confidence, ma'am. It's honesty.<br> I just hate to see a beautiful woman<br> going all to waste.<br> "Waste," did you say?<br> There's a subject I might<br> tell you something about.<br> I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.<br> You're probably not even remotely aware<br> of some of them.<br> Would you like to hear?<br> For instance, what about<br> the house without a child?<br> There's one sort for you.<br> Then there's another.<br> You're doing fine, Sergeant.<br> My husband's off somewhere,<br> and it's raining outside<br> and we're both drinking now.<br> You've probably only got one thing wrong,<br> the lady herself.<br> The lady's not what she seems.<br> She's a washout, if you know what I mean.<br> And I'm sure you know what I mean.<br> You gonna cry?<br> Not if I can help it.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?<br> I don't know, Sergeant. I don't know.<br> Step on it, boy!<br> - Speed it up.<br> - I'm speedin'.<br> Payday, payday<br> All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?<br> Knock it off.<br> Angelo, a dollar he's wrong, coming up.<br> Hey, paisan, come here!<br> Sorry, gentlemen,<br> I already won my bankroll in the latrine.<br> Besides, it's a penny-ante game.<br> All right, what are you covering here?<br> Come on, buddy boy, we're goin' to town.<br> Look, don't let 'em get your goat.<br> We'll just dress up in civvies and we're as<br> good as the rest of the world, ain't we?<br> Here, wear this.<br> My sister sent it to me.<br> She buys everything too big.<br> Look, first we'll hit a few bars, see?<br> Then we go to a place of which I'm a member,<br> the New Congress Club.<br> Girls.<br> You got any prejudices against girls?<br> That's what I thought.<br> Well, now, looks like you're<br> all primed for a big night, Top.<br> - Hello, Stark.<br> - Want some company?<br> No, thanks. All tied up.<br> Leva tells me you've been eyeing<br> the captain's wife<br> like a hound dog at huntin' time.<br> He has, huh?<br> What else did that character tell you?<br> She took up with a lot of men<br> back there at Fort Bliss.<br> Well,<br> I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.<br> This ain't no story,<br> 'cause I was one of them myself.<br> Not for long, though.<br> Sure is something strange about that woman.<br> Yeah. Thanks for the tip.<br> See ya.<br> Hello.<br> - I didn't think you were coming.<br> - Why not? I ain't late.<br> No, I guess you're not.<br> But then I got here a little early.<br> I must have been overanxious.<br> You weren't, though, were you?<br> I stopped along the way<br> for a couple of drinks.<br> You certainly chose<br> a lovely spot for our meeting.<br> I've had three chances to be picked up<br> in the last five minutes.<br> Well,<br> that's par for the course around here.<br> Well, I don't care for it.<br> I never went in much for back-alley loving.<br> Take it easy.<br> You probably think I'm a tramp.<br> Now, what makes you think<br> I'd think a thing like that?<br> Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.<br> If you think this is a mistake,<br> come right out and say so.<br> Well, I guess it's about time for me<br> to be getting home, isn't it?<br> - Well, isn't it?<br> - What's the matter?<br> What started all this anyway?<br> Do you think I'd be here<br> if I thought it was a mistake?<br> Taking a chance on 20 years in Leavenworth<br> for making dates with<br> the company commander's wife?<br> And her actin' like Lady Astor's horse.<br> And all because I got here on time!<br> Well, on the other hand,<br> I've got a bathing suit under my dress.<br> Me, too.<br> She's comin'.<br> Why, it's Angelo Maggio!<br> Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.<br> There you are, sweetie pie.<br> Dues all paid up.<br> Hey, who you got playing the piano there?<br> A hippo?<br> Oh, Angelo,<br> I don't think I've met your friend.<br> Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.<br> Oh, you know how I hate it<br> when you boys are in this condition.<br> You see that, buddy boy?<br> A woman sees a soldier,<br> and, like that, she figures he's drunk.<br> - Why? You know why?<br> - Because he is.<br> Well, heavy drinking simply doesn't mix<br> with the entertainment business.<br> Every respectable place<br> has to consider its future.<br> Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, you have my solemn<br> word your future will be safe with us!<br> Angelo is one of my favorites.<br> Annette, dear, take care of this<br> gentleman for me, will you, please?<br> That'll be four bucks, baby face.<br> Two for initiation fee,<br> two for this month's dues.<br> What do I get for it?<br> Members are entitled<br> to all privileges of the club,<br> which includes dancing,<br> snack bar, soft drink bar<br> and gentlemanly relaxation<br> with the opposite gender,<br> so long as they are gentlemen<br> and no liquor is permitted.<br> - Got it?<br> - I got it.<br> Girls, here's some new poison.<br> This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.<br> - Nice meeting you.<br> - Hi, there.<br> Don't tell me the princess is your style.<br> This is Suzanne and Roxanne.<br> - Hello, there.<br> - Would you like to dance, honey?<br> Hey!<br> Much as I adore your company,<br> I hope I may be allowed to tear myself away.<br> I just saw a few friends at the door,<br> and I can also see<br> that I will be of no further use to you.<br> Hi. You busy?<br> What's your name?<br> I'm Lorene.<br> Lorene, huh?<br> I haven't seen you in here before.<br> I haven't been in here before.<br> My friend brought me.<br> He and I, we're stationed out at Schofield.<br> Oh, I didn't think you were a soldier.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Well, I...<br> I'm a 30-year man.<br> I'm in for the whole ride.<br> Well, I suppose it's different when<br> a fella's gonna make a career of it.<br> Ain't nothin' the matter with a soldier<br> that ain't the matter with everyone else.<br> I like you just the same.<br> I liked you the minute<br> I saw Annette bringing you in.<br> You did? It's funny, I came in, I stood there<br> and saw you sittin' over here.<br> Why don't you knock it off<br> or put a mute in that thing!<br> I'll play loud as I want, you little wop!<br> Little wop?<br> Mess with me, fat stuff,<br> and I'll bust you up.<br> You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.<br> - Wait right here for me, will you?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> Gentlemen, you know I will not...<br> This little Mussolini here<br> is tryin' to tell me how...<br> Like to bust my eardrums<br> with the stinkin' noise!<br> - Let's not be cruel.<br> - Break it up, Angelo.<br> You men will just have to go<br> if you can't behave yourselves.<br> - Only my friends call me wop.<br> - Do you know who that guy is?<br> - What do I care who he is?<br> - Who is he?<br> Fatso Judson, Sergeant of the Guard<br> in the stockade.<br> I'm tellin' you, let him alone.<br> I seen him nearly murder a guy once.<br> He likes it.<br> Okay, bully boy, now you won the war.<br> Let's dance, huh?<br> Yeah, we'll dance, we'll dance.<br> First I gotta calm my nerves.<br> Let's go to a phone booth<br> or something, huh?<br> Where I will unveil a fifth of whiskey I have<br> here under my loose-flowing sports shirt.<br> Don't get hurt, pal.<br> Your balance has got to be letter perfect.<br> I thought you were gonna wait.<br> - Bill here was telling me about surfboarding.<br> - Hello, friend.<br> Just sit down and listen.<br> He describes it thrillingly.<br> Do you know anything about surfboarding?<br> No, nothing. Not a thing.<br> You must be stationed inland, then.<br> I'm at DeRussy, so I get lots of chances.<br> Yeah, but then we got mountains.<br> Do you know anything<br> about mountain climbing?<br> A little bit.<br> - You a mountain climber?<br> - No.<br> Do you know anything<br> about flying an airplane?<br> I've had a few lessons.<br> I can't fly, either.<br> What do you know about deep-sea diving?<br> Bill, shall we move into another room?<br> Sure. The air in here seems<br> to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?<br> - I noticed that.<br> - Listen, fella...<br> Come on, let's go.<br> How was the deep-sea diver?<br> That was a terrible way you acted.<br> Maybe I was jealous.<br> You're a funny one.<br> What do you dames want?<br> To tease a man to death?<br> What do you think Mrs. Kipfer hires us for?<br> She pays us to be nice to all the boys.<br> You're all alike. Is it so important?<br> It is important. We may seem all alike.<br> We ain't all alike.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Look...<br> Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's parlor<br> and sit there.<br> She lets us use it sometimes<br> for somebody special.<br> I'll go ask her.<br> - Then you're not mad?<br> - No, I'm not mad.<br> Because if you're still mad,<br> I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.<br> You certainly are a funny one.<br> I never knew it could be like this.<br> Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.<br> Nobody?<br> No, nobody.<br> Not even one?<br> Out of all the men you've been kissed by?<br> Now, that'd take some figuring.<br> - How many men do you think there've been?<br> - I wouldn't know.<br> - Can't you give me a rough estimate?<br> - Not without an adding machine.<br> - Do you have your adding machine with you?<br> - I forgot to bring it.<br> Then I guess you won't find out, will you?<br> Maybe I already know.<br> What's the matter? What are you hinting at?<br> Why? Is there something to hint at?<br> Maybe there's been a long line<br> of beach parties.<br> - You must be crazy.<br> - Am I?<br> What about when you and Holmes<br> were back at Fort Bliss?<br> Did you ever hear of a soldier named Stark?<br> Maylon Stark?<br> Why, yes.<br> "Why, yes." You knew him, too, didn't you?<br> Didn't you?<br> I had to go and forget<br> you were like all the rest of them.<br> Only it's true, ain't it? Well, ain't it?<br> Why don't you tell me about it?<br> Tell me the story.<br> There's always a story.<br> You don't leave a person anything, do you?<br> Come back here, Sergeant.<br> I'll tell you the story.<br> You can take it back to the barracks with you.<br> I'd only been married to Dana two years<br> when I found out he was cheating.<br> And by that time, I was pregnant.<br> I thought I had something to hope for.<br> I was almost happy<br> the night the pains began.<br> I remember Dana was going<br> to an officer's conference.<br> I told him to get home early,<br> to bring the doctor with him.<br> And maybe he would have, if his conference<br> hadn't been with a hat check girl.<br> He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.<br> I was lying on the floor.<br> I begged him to go for the doctor,<br> but he fell on the couch and passed out.<br> The baby was born about an hour later.<br> Of course it was dead. It was a boy.<br> But they worked over me at the hospital.<br> They fixed me up fine.<br> They even took my appendix out.<br> They threw that in free.<br> - Karen?<br> - And one more thing. No more children.<br> Sure, I went out with men after that,<br> and if I'd ever found one that...<br> Karen, listen to me. Listen.<br> I know.<br> Until I met you,<br> I didn't think it was possible either.<br> I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own<br> to get away from my hometown in Oregon.<br> How come?<br> I had a boyfriend.<br> I was a waitress,<br> and he was from the richest family in town.<br> He just married a girl<br> suitable for his position.<br> After three years of going around with me.<br> It's a pretty story, isn't it?<br> Maybe they could write a book about it.<br> They did. Thousands of them.<br> So I left and went to Seattle.<br> I got there and I met a girl<br> just back from Hawaii,<br> and she said she'd made<br> a lot of money working there.<br> So I caught the first boat.<br> I've been here a year and two months.<br> You don't like it very much, do you?<br> Oh, I don't like it, but I don't mind it.<br> Anyway, I won't be here forever.<br> No. Sure. I mean, why should you?<br> I got it all figured out. In another year,<br> I'll be home with a stocking full of money.<br> And I'll be all set for life.<br> Who is it?<br> I didn't hear no sounds of combat,<br> so I thought you might want a drink.<br> - You've been hogging the whiskey, Angelo.<br> - Not me, buddy.<br> It's that Sandra.<br> She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.<br> I hope there's a cop under that.<br> Keep pourin'. Keep pourin'.<br> No, thanks. I don't drink.<br> I think it's a weakness.<br> I grant you that.<br> I don't like weakness. Do you?<br> No, I don't like weakness,<br> but I like to drink.<br> Hey, what are you gonna do, marry this guy?<br> You're grinnin' at him like you're his wife.<br> Get out of here.<br> Okay, okay. I'm goin'.<br> Back to old long-legged Sandra.<br> I love 'em tall.<br> Acres and acres.<br> Enjoy yourself, paisan.<br> You need this more than I do.<br> Tomorrow,<br> you'll be back with the treatment.<br> What does he mean?<br> Hey, that was nice before,<br> the way you snuggled up in front of him.<br> What's a "treatment"?<br> Oh, some of the guys puttin' me over<br> the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.<br> Fight?<br> Yeah, on a boxing team. I don't want to box.<br> I don't even want to think about it.<br> Well, why should you have to box?<br> Well, see, I used to fight.<br> Middleweight. And I was pretty good.<br> They know it. Well, anyway...<br> Well, come on, tell me. I want to hear.<br> Well, the thing is, see...<br> I used to work out with this guy Dixie Wells.<br> He was a real good friend of mine.<br> Loved to box.<br> People on the outside had their eye on him.<br> He was gonna come out of the army<br> and go right up to the top.<br> Well, one afternoon,<br> he and I were sparring around in the gym,<br> you know, kind of friendly-like,<br> and he must have been set<br> pretty flat on his feet,<br> because I caught him with a...<br> No more than ordinary right cross...<br> And he didn't get up, he didn't move.<br> He was in a coma for a week,<br> and finally he did pull out of it.<br> Only the thing was that he was blind.<br> Well, I went to see him at the hospital<br> a couple of times,<br> then, finally, I just couldn't go back.<br> The last time, he and I started<br> talking about fighting, and...<br> He started to cry.<br> And seeing tears coming out of those eyes<br> that couldn't see anything.<br> I thought I oughta tell you.<br> Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.<br> From now on, it's no holds barred.<br> They aim to run you right into the stockade<br> if they got to.<br> Let 'em.<br> I'll help you as much as I can,<br> but I can't get too far out on a limb.<br> I ain't riskin' losing my stripes.<br> I like this outfit.<br> So do I. That's funny, ain't it?<br> Yeah. Yeah, that is funny.<br> Keep goin' in a straight line, Prewitt.<br> Keep goin'!<br> All right, that's enough.<br> Okay, Prewitt, bury it.<br> My hitch was up Monday<br> Not a dog soldier no more<br> I ain't a soldier no more<br> They gave me all that money<br> So much my pockets is sore<br> Oh, my pockets is sore<br> Yeah, that a boy!<br> More dough than I can use<br> Reenlistment blues<br> Sing it, boys!<br> Time!<br> Clean up the mess, Prewitt!<br> Hurry it up!<br> You're on fatigue detail, not a vacation!<br> - Come on! Clean it up!<br> - Clean it up yourself!<br> What?<br> You heard me.<br> Rub your own nose in it a while.<br> Prewitt, you know better than to talk back<br> to a noncommissioned officer?<br> Yes, sir.<br> But I've never liked being spit on, sir,<br> not even by a noncommissioned officer.<br> You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.<br> I don't think so, sir. I think Sergeant<br> Galovitch owes me an apology.<br> - Corporal Peluso?<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Have this man roll a full field pack,<br> extra shoes and helmet,<br> take a bicycle and hike him up to Kolekole<br> Pass and back, then bring him to me.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All right, Prewitt, let's go.<br> Time!<br> Hold it a minute.<br> Go ahead, Prewitt, and have a cigarette.<br> I don't like this any more than you do.<br> Thanks.<br> I take it you're ready to apologize<br> to Sergeant Galovitch now?<br> No, sir, I'm not.<br> Peluso, take him up there again.<br> Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.<br> You can't be decent to a man like that.<br> You have to treat him like an animal.<br> Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.<br> Insubordination<br> to a noncommissioned officer.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Only it's a shame.<br> - What is?<br> Well, I was just thinking, sir, It's too bad<br> you've gotta lose a good middleweight.<br> I don't care. I don't have<br> to stand for that kind of insolence.<br> No, sir, you sure don't.<br> I'll prepare the papers, then.<br> The only trouble is that even<br> if he gets just three months,<br> he'll still be in the stockade<br> when the boxing finals come up.<br> Do you see any other way of breaking him?<br> Well, you could double up<br> on company punishment, sir.<br> All right. I'll throw the book at him.<br> Yes, sir,<br> if you think that's the way to do it.<br> Nice goin', Sarge.<br> Keep lookin', Mazzioli, you'll find yourself<br> scrubbin' this orderly room floor!<br> Comin' through! Watch it!<br> Me and my waiters are working our tails off.<br> Hot! Hot! H-O-T!<br> How you doing, buddy boy? Better than<br> being thrown in the stockade, ain't it?<br> How am I doing, Sarge?<br> I'm a rough man, man.<br> Slow up a little there, Angelo,<br> so you can stop sweating in the food.<br> Don't hold me back, Sarge.<br> Don't hold me back.<br> I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.<br> Well, you'll never make it.<br> - Hiya, Sarge.<br> - Hiya, Top.<br> Life in a rifle company.<br> You look awful tired, kid.<br> How do you like straight duty?<br> - What makes you think I mind it, Warden?<br> - I didn't say you minded it.<br> I just said you looked tired.<br> You know, drawn to a fine edge.<br> Oh, I like this life. It's a great life.<br> If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.<br> Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?<br> If you didn't put me here,<br> I'd have no chance to find it, right?<br> Now, there's a man for you.<br> What do you know?<br> Since you like it so much,<br> I'll see if I can find some more for you.<br> How about garbage detail?<br> Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.<br> So you did. What about street cleaning?<br> - Yesterday.<br> - You got a better memory than me.<br> Of course, if you were smart...<br> Yeah, but I ain't smart.<br> I know, but if you were,<br> you wouldn't have to pull K.P.,<br> or any other fatigue duty, for that matter.<br> If you think you can bribe me into boxing,<br> Warden, you're wrong.<br> You're wrong. Not you<br> and Dynamite Holmes and the treatment.<br> How long are you guys gonna keep<br> breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?<br> You've had him on that extra duty roster<br> a month already.<br> - I can't see why you...<br> - Can't you, Pete?<br> What's the matter, you getting soft<br> in your old age?<br> Maybe I want to teach the kid a lesson.<br> - Maybe you like it.<br> - Maybe I do.<br> I'm getting sick and tired watching you<br> being a stooge for Holmes.<br> Yeah, well, you ain't gonna<br> see it much longer.<br> I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.<br> I'm through, Pete.<br> Any day now, and I mean it!<br> Listen, if Holmes would let me,<br> I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.<br> There's half a dozen companies<br> in this regiment that'd grab me.<br> - And in grade, too.<br> - Oh, sure.<br> I could be chief of staff, too, only I just<br> can't think of leaving my old buddies.<br> Where are you going, Little Sir Echo?<br> To take my shower, if the stinking<br> First Sergeant has no objections.<br> Where'd you think?<br> To the movies in this towel?<br> Hurry up. We'll get some beer.<br> I wouldn't drink with you<br> if it was the last beer in the world.<br> I'm buying.<br> That's different.<br> Wow!<br> Rose.<br> You know why I like<br> to have you serve me beer?<br> So's I can watch you when you walk away.<br> It's in regulations.<br> You got a right to complain.<br> You got a right to take your case<br> to the inspector general.<br> Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.<br> No. I ain't gonna complain.<br> They ain't gonna get that satisfaction.<br> Believe it or not, this is one soldier<br> that's got a real big family.<br> Fifteen of 'em,<br> 'course this is only half of them.<br> You see the gentleman with the handlebars?<br> That's Mr. Maggio.<br> Mr. Maggio is my father.<br> Never saw anybody so stubborn.<br> How long is it since they<br> let you go into town?<br> - Six weeks.<br> - It's liable to be six years.<br> How'd you like it,<br> six years before you see a dame?<br> Look, why don't you just<br> mind your own business, huh?<br> And where did you learn to play the bugle?<br> That's my buddy boy!<br> Who's the broad?<br> My sister.<br> Maggio, what are you doin'?<br> - You hit me!<br> - Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.<br> - Why, you dirty wop!<br> - If you want to fight, take it outside!<br> I'm gonna cut this wop's heart out.<br> Anybody steps in here,<br> I give it to him first.<br> One step further, Fatso,<br> and I'm gonna de-brain you. I'll kill...<br> Nobody's gonna do nothin'! Anybody<br> does any killing around here, I'll do it!<br> - This is a private affair, Warden.<br> - No, it ain't!<br> This man's in my company!<br> You ain't making two extra weeks'<br> paperwork for me for nothing.<br> Out for blood, huh?<br> You'd puke your guts out<br> at the sight of a dead man.<br> Put down that stool. Put it down!<br> Drop that knife.<br> Okay, Fatso,<br> if it's killing you want, come on.<br> Well, come on.<br> On the floor!<br> Killers, huh? I'd trade the pair<br> of you for a good Camp Fire girl.<br> Tough monkey.<br> Guys like you end up<br> in the stockade sooner or later.<br> Someday you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.<br> I'll show you a couple of things.<br> I'm gonna get a breath of air.<br> I'm glad he stopped it.<br> He's a good man.<br> You keep it.<br> Keep it for a souvenir.<br> Okay, I'll keep it.<br> You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?<br> Prewitt.<br> Could you stand a weekend pass?<br> Could I...<br> What about Holmes?<br> Don't worry about Holmes. He signs anything<br> I put in front of him without reading it.<br> Sure could use it.<br> I hear you gone dippy over some dame<br> down at the New Congress Club.<br> - What'd you say her name was?<br> - Lorene.<br> Beautiful name.<br> Hey, paisan!<br> What's holding you up? Let's get going?<br> What's the matter, buddy boy?<br> Don't you like it here?<br> You got something better to do in town?<br> Look, the bus is leaving right away.<br> I'm taking the bus, right?<br> Take off. You're talking to a rich man.<br> I'll hop a taxi.<br> I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.<br> Maggio, get ready for guard.<br> Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.<br> Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.<br> What? I got a pass!<br> Not anymore. Anderson's sick.<br> You're on guard.<br> I just had guard yesterday. Why me?<br> I'll tell you why you.<br> You should've gotten dressed faster.<br> I sure never figured<br> in your giving me the runaround.<br> - They didn't even want to let me in this place.<br> - We're mobbed, that's why.<br> There's a big crowd from Hickam Field,<br> and they got in here first.<br> Anyway, what'd you expect,<br> a brass band to meet you?<br> - No. I did think you'd want to see me.<br> - I'm busy, can't you see?<br> - Yes, I can see. It's crowded.<br> - Well, I am.<br> Look, Maggio's gonna be<br> at the Kalakaua Inn later.<br> Ain't there no way you can get out of here?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> I work here, you know, after all.<br> Can't you understand?<br> Yes, I do. I understand.<br> I understand very well.<br> You haven't been around here in weeks,<br> and now you turn up all of a sudden and...<br> Watch it, Mack! Watch where you're going!<br> Come on out of here.<br> Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?<br> I can't just walk out.<br> And even if I could, she doesn't like us<br> to see the boys on the outside.<br> Look, if you feel that way,<br> just forget about it, okay?<br> You haven't any claims on me, Mister.<br> - You're not my husband, you know.<br> - There you are, Lorene.<br> I vastly admire your taste, my dear,<br> but we really need Lorene now.<br> So many of the gentlemen are unattended.<br> It is such a rush, isn't it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - One might almost mistake us...<br> For one of those<br> big political conventions in Philadelphia.<br> - You are coming, Lorene?<br> - In a minute.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - How do you think I feel?<br> I may not get another pass for months.<br> I've been counting on this<br> like a kid counts on Christmas.<br> But forget it. Forget it. Lorene's busy.<br> Lorene has got work to do. Lorene's sorry.<br> Oh, stop calling me Lorene!<br> My name's Alma!<br> - Alma?<br> - Yes, Alma Burke!<br> Alma?<br> Mrs. Kipfer picked "Lorene"<br> out of a perfume ad.<br> She thought it sounded French.<br> Hey, how'd you get away?<br> I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.<br> - But I bet she doesn't believe it.<br> - I bet she doesn't.<br> - What'll you have?<br> - A coke, please.<br> Yeah, give her a Coke. Big Coke.<br> It's great you meeting me here, you know?<br> See, I'm just lucky getting in town.<br> - Topkick gave me a break.<br> - They still pouring it on?<br> Holmes and those others,<br> they really got me on the edge.<br> - Gee, you must hate the army.<br> - No, I don't hate the army.<br> But look what it's doing to you.<br> I love the army.<br> But it sure doesn't love you.<br> A man loves a thing,<br> that don't mean it's gotta love him back.<br> Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.<br> You love a thing,<br> you've got to be grateful.<br> See, I left home when I was 17.<br> Both my folks is dead, and I didn't belong<br> no place till I entered the army.<br> If it weren't for the army,<br> I wouldn't have learned how to bugle.<br> - To bugle?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's the mouthpiece that I used<br> when I played a Taps at Arlington.<br> They picked me to play a Taps<br> at Arlington cemetery on Armistice Day.<br> The president was there.<br> I play the bugle well.<br> Hello, citizens!<br> - Hey, where you been?<br> - Hi, pals.<br> I've been in three bars,<br> and I put a dent in all three of them.<br> - Yeah, you look it.<br> - Give me a nail, Prew. I'm hungry for a nail.<br> What you doing in uniform?<br> I'm thinking of joining the army.<br> Or maybe I'll go to Mexico<br> and become a cowboy.<br> You want to go with me?<br> You keep on drinking,<br> you'll be as much use as a melted candle.<br> You're absolutely right.<br> Bartender, whiskey!<br> Large whiskey.<br> Excuse me. Hey, buddy.<br> Sam!<br> Hey, comin' out, fellas.<br> The terror of Gimbel's basement.<br> Stand back there, now. Here we go.<br> A seven for daddy. Five, deuce.<br> Hey, seven.<br> Snake eyes. That's the story of my life.<br> Hey, Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel<br> around the corner.<br> That's where all those movie stars stay.<br> Listen, paisan, you'd better simmer down.<br> You got a whole weekend ahead of you.<br> - That's what you say, buddy.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - They only gave you an overnight pass?<br> - No pass.<br> No pass at all. They put me on<br> guard duty, but old Angelo, he foxed 'em.<br> You walked off guard?<br> I checked in,<br> and I checked right out again.<br> You get your tail right back to the post.<br> You're in trouble. You know that.<br> Hey, hey, Prew, Prew, I got a good idea.<br> Let's go swimmin'!<br> We'll go swimming with a movie star.<br> That's what I'm gonna do,<br> go swim with a movie star!<br> Listen, Angelo...<br> Twenty feet tall!<br> I'm going swimmin' with a movie star.<br> You'd better go.<br> Hey, Angelo.<br> Jerk, get up. Wake up.<br> I'm awake, I'm awake.<br> What are you hollering?<br> Yeah, you're awake.<br> Put your clothes on, all right?<br> Give them back to the Indians.<br> The Indians need the clothes.<br> All they wear is G-strings.<br> You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.<br> Hey, I am waiting here for a movie star<br> to come out of the hotel,<br> and I am not going until she shows up.<br> Put your clothes on.<br> Let's get out of here before<br> we get in trouble, okay?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Can't a man get drunk?<br> Can't a man do nothin'?<br> Can't he put his lousy hands<br> in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?<br> A man gotta be hounded all his life?<br> Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.<br> - I ain't no coward!<br> - Buddy boy, look.<br> You get dressed, you put your clothes on.<br> - Will you wait for me? I'll get a cab.<br> - Yeah, yeah, sure.<br> - Will you wait?<br> - Yeah, you get a cab.<br> Hey, M.P.s! Come and get me, you guys!<br> Here I am!<br> Is that the best you can do?<br> I bet you guys eat Wheaties!<br> Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?<br> - It's on right now.<br> - He'll get the stockade sure.<br> Maybe he won't get it.<br> All he did was to get drunk.<br> It's a soldier's nature.<br> It's almost his sacred duty once in a while.<br> But he walked off guard. He went A.W.O.L.<br> - What're you hanging around here for?<br> - Can't a man rest?<br> What man? You got no work?<br> Maybe I can scare you up some.<br> Go on and shoot some pool.<br> Any word comes through, I'll let you know.<br> Company "G."<br> First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.<br> Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.<br> He got it. Six months.<br> I'm gonna escape from this dump.<br> Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me,<br> neither can no lousy stockade.<br> - Shut up.<br> - Whatever you say, Brownie.<br> Prisoner, halt!<br> Hello, tough monkey.<br> This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.<br> This is a very fashionable district.<br> I have another key made for you.<br> You can use it any time you want to,<br> even when I'm not here.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.<br> - This is Georgette, my roommate.<br> - Well, welcome, friend.<br> There hasn't been a man around the house<br> since the cat died.<br> I belong to the Book Guild Club.<br> I always take every book.<br> That's the way I get all the dividends.<br> She'll be great for your friend Maggio<br> when he gets out of the stockade.<br> Yes, he'll be crazy about her.<br> Just sit down and get comfortable.<br> I'll make you a martini<br> and see what's to cook for dinner.<br> Hey, this is like being married, ain't it?<br> It's better.<br> You okay?<br> Glad you came?<br> Let's get out of here. Don't look around.<br> It can't go on like this much longer.<br> Even when we sneaked<br> clear across the island tonight,<br> we had to run out like jailbirds.<br> If there was only some way we...<br> Holmes would probably give you a divorce,<br> but he'd never let me<br> transfer out of his outfit.<br> There is a way.<br> I've been thinking about it.<br> You've got to become an officer.<br> You can take the new extension course,<br> the one they passed last May.<br> When you get your commission,<br> they'd ship you back to the States.<br> An officer?<br> Yes. Then I could divorce Dana<br> and marry you.<br> I hate officers!<br> I've always hated officers!<br> Well, that's a fine,<br> intelligent point of view.<br> Suppose I said I always hated sergeants?<br> That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?<br> You sure made a complete study of it.<br> Okay, suppose I did it.<br> And don't think it's a cinch.<br> Then you'd be getting your divorce here<br> while I was in the States.<br> We'd be apart maybe six months.<br> We're sure to be into a war by then.<br> Why don't you tell the truth?<br> You just don't want the responsibility.<br> You're probably not even in love with me.<br> You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you!<br> Maybe I could enjoy life again.<br> So they were married<br> and lived unhappily ever after.<br> I've never been so miserable in my life<br> as I have since I met you.<br> Neither have I.<br> I wouldn't trade a minute of it.<br> Neither would I.<br> I'll probably make the lousiest officer<br> in this man's army you ever saw.<br> You'll make a fine officer.<br> A remarkable officer.<br> Thank you.<br> Come here.<br> Can't you wait until we finish dinner?<br> - Honey?<br> - What?<br> I want to marry you.<br> You're a funny one.<br> Why? Why is it funny<br> if a guy wants to marry you?<br> Because I'm a girl you met<br> at the New Congress Club.<br> That's about two steps up<br> from the pavement.<br> Well, what am I?<br> I'm a private no-class dogface.<br> The way most civilians look at that,<br> that's two steps up from nothing.<br> Prew, I thought we were happy.<br> Why do you want to spoil things?<br> Look,<br> I've got a year to go before I reenlist.<br> If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,<br> they'll let me go back to the States.<br> Then you and I can<br> go back there together, if you'll wait.<br> How do you expect to become a sergeant<br> under that Captain Holmes of yours?<br> It's all you can do<br> to keep out of the stockade.<br> I'll fight.<br> - No, you're not gonna fight.<br> - It'd be worth it.<br> Prew, it's true we love each other now,<br> we need each other,<br> but back in the States,<br> it might be different.<br> That ain't the real reason.<br> - All right, it's not.<br> - What is the real reason?<br> I won't marry you, because I don't want<br> to be the wife of a soldier.<br> Well, that would be about<br> the best I could ever do for you.<br> Because nobody's gonna<br> stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.<br> Because I want to be proper.<br> - Proper?<br> - Yes, proper.<br> In another year, I'll have<br> enough money saved,<br> and then I'm gonna go back<br> to my hometown in Oregon,<br> and I'm gonna build a house<br> for my mother and myself,<br> and join the country club and take up golf.<br> And I'll meet the proper man<br> with the proper position,<br> and make a proper wife who can run<br> a proper home and raise proper children.<br> And I'll be happy<br> because when you're proper, you're safe.<br> You got guts, honey.<br> I hope you can pull it off.<br> I do mean it when I say I need you,<br> 'cause I'm lonely.<br> You think I'm lying, don't you?<br> Nobody ever lies about being lonely.<br> And don't talk to me about a divorce.<br> Why? Because the scandal would spoil<br> your chances for a promotion?<br> I ask you once more.<br> I want to know who he is<br> and where you met him.<br> I'm not going to tell you.<br> One thing I know. I know he's a civilian.<br> You'd be too discreet to pick an army man.<br> I wonder which is hurt more,<br> your pride or your curiosity?<br> You can't expect to know how<br> I feel about a thing like this.<br> I wonder why men feel<br> so differently about it than women.<br> It's just not the same.<br> It's a lovely day.<br> I think I'll go for a walk.<br> Hey.<br> I hear you just got out of the stockade.<br> It was rugged. I kept my mouth shut,<br> and I didn't get in no trouble.<br> Did you see Maggio?<br> Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.<br> He's using a billy, too.<br> Places where it won't show,<br> in the back, in the chest.<br> He's got it down to a system.<br> He kicks him a lot, too.<br> You know how Maggio's taking it?<br> He just keeps spittin' in Fatso's eye.<br> Ain't he a hot one?<br> He's a good man.<br> Well, Fatso can't make a dent in him.<br> But that Fatso, he's smart.<br> He makes sure the O.D. never sees nothing.<br> Why doesn't Maggio go to the O.D. himself?<br> We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.<br> That boy's about<br> the toughest nut in the woods.<br> You think he's gonna be all right, huh?<br> - Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.<br> - What do you mean?<br> After Fatso threw him in the hole,<br> that's solitary,<br> he started talking a couple of times<br> about how he's gonna escape.<br> He said to tell you<br> he'll look you up one of these nights.<br> Still on your knees, huh, Prewitt?<br> Well, boxing finals next month.<br> December 15th.<br> You've still got time<br> to help us win the championship.<br> Are you proud to be in this company or not?<br> I ain't gonna move around you again.<br> Something tells me<br> you need a lesson, Prewitt.<br> Maybe I'll give it to you myself.<br> Come on, leave him alone, Ike.<br> He's in my detail now.<br> You're gonna get in trouble<br> if you fight around here.<br> - Get back to work, Prew.<br> - Get out of the way!<br> I'll be glad to put<br> my recommendation on that, Warden.<br> You've got service, experience, grade.<br> - You'll make an excellent officer.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> It'd be a feather in my cap, too.<br> A man from my company.<br> At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?<br> They're fighting outside, sir.<br> Galovitch and Prewitt.<br> Prewitt?<br> Galovitch looks like<br> he's gonna murder him, sir.<br> I'll take care of it.<br> - Don't you want to see?<br> - No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!<br> Why don't Prew go for his head?<br> He blinded a guy once.<br> Must be scared of the same thing.<br> The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!<br> - Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!<br> - I'll fight any way I want!<br> Come on, Prew! Get him!<br> Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?<br> - What's his name, Major?<br> - Captain Holmes, sir.<br> Ten-hut!<br> At ease. What started this?<br> Prewitt refused order I gave him,<br> talked back and started a fight.<br> I taught him a lesson.<br> You won't disobey<br> any more orders in my company, Prewitt.<br> Sir, I'm sorry, sir, but Private Prewitt's not<br> to blame, Sergeant Galovitch started it.<br> - Thornhill.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You're in charge of this detail.<br> What about it?<br> He's right, sir. Prewitt done nothing.<br> Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.<br> That's all. Let's forget it.<br> Let's get back to our jobs.<br> All right, back to work.<br> Let's go. Break it up.<br> If you guys think this means<br> I'm stepping into a ring, you're wrong.<br> You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.<br> Took my dough to town Tuesday<br> Found me a big feather bed<br> Oh, a big feather bed<br> A big double bed<br> I'll find a job tomorrow<br> Tonight I'll sleep like I'm dead<br> I'm gonna sleep like I'm dead<br> And get up when I choose<br> Reenlistment blues<br> Hey, Friday.<br> - Why are you called Friday?<br> - I don't know.<br> But I was born on a Wednesday.<br> I hit the bars Wednesday<br> Made me some friends on my own<br> Lotta friends on my own<br> Found a pretty baby<br> She couldn't leave me alone<br> Oh, leave me alone<br> She kept me buyin' booze<br> Reenlistment blues<br> Reenlistment blues<br> I had the misery Thursday<br> The walls was movin' I swear<br> Oh, they was movin' I swear<br> I reached down in my trousers<br> And all my pockets was bare<br> That gal was sure bad news<br> Reenlistment blues<br> Hey, Prewitt, where you going?<br> What do you mean, where am I going?<br> I'm going to Choy's.<br> I'm gonna get me another beer.<br> My hitch was up Monday<br> Not a dog soldier no more<br> I ain't a soldier no more<br> Halt!<br> - Who goes there?<br> - A friend.<br> Advance, friend, and be recognized!<br> Ten-hut!<br> Right face! Rear face!<br> On your knees! Scrub the floor!<br> At ease.<br> Hello, kid.<br> What are you doing out here all by yourself?<br> - I'm gonna get a little drink.<br> - Sit down. I got a bottle.<br> Thanks, Top.<br> I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you<br> beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.<br> Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.<br> Life's crummy, you know it?<br> Yes, sir, it's miserable.<br> Perfectly miserable.<br> What do you suppose would happen,<br> if a truck was to come along<br> and run us over?<br> - We'd be dead.<br> - You'd better not sit here anymore.<br> You'd better get up<br> and sit over on the side of the road.<br> What? What do you mean, I better?<br> You've got more to live for than I do.<br> You got your whole company to take care of.<br> You move over, move over<br> to the other side of the road.<br> - Go on.<br> - I'm older! It don't matter if I die.<br> But you got your whole life ahead of you.<br> Now, don't argue.<br> - Go on, get up.<br> - No, sir, not Prewitt.<br> Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.<br> Okay, we'll stay together.<br> I don't... I couldn't have got up anyway.<br> I got the biggest troubles<br> in the whole world.<br> In the whole world, huh?<br> Take love.<br> Did you personally ever see any of this love?<br> You'll understand what I mean.<br> This girl, see,<br> she wants me to become...<br> - Become what?<br> - An officer.<br> Can you see me as an officer?<br> Yeah. Yeah, I can see you as an officer.<br> - You'd be a good officer.<br> - Well, you both can see more than I can see.<br> I don't wanna be an officer.<br> I'm happy where I am.<br> I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.<br> You wouldn't want me<br> to be a guy like Holmes, would you?<br> Well, would you?<br> A man should be what he can do.<br> How's your girl?<br> What's her name again?<br> - Lorene.<br> - Oh, yeah, Lorene.<br> I remember now.<br> A beautiful name.<br> Beautiful.<br> You two dumb, crazy screwballs!<br> What are you trying to do,<br> get yourself killed?<br> What are you doing<br> in the middle of the road?<br> My friend Prew and I,<br> sittin' here discussin' the weather.<br> - Your friend, huh?<br> - You heard me.<br> Don't you know<br> you gotta take care of this man?<br> Holmes is bound to get him sooner or later.<br> And he's the best stinkin' soldier<br> in the whole army.<br> You both got rocks in your head.<br> Angelo, Angelo.<br> I figured you'd be here at Choy's.<br> I done it, Prew.<br> I escaped, just like I said.<br> Just like I figured.<br> In the back of a truck, under a tarp.<br> They rode me right out,<br> just like I figured.<br> Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,<br> about a mile back,<br> and I fell out in the road.<br> You should've seen me bounce.<br> I must've broke something.<br> Prew. Prew, listen.<br> Fatso done it, Prew.<br> He likes to whack me in the gut.<br> He asks me if it hurts,<br> and I spit at him like always.<br> Only yesterday, it was bad.<br> He hit me, he hit me, he hit me.<br> I had to get out, Prew. I had to get out.<br> Buddy, buddy.<br> They gonna send you to the stockade, Prew?<br> No, they ain't gonna send me<br> to the stockade.<br> Watch out for Fatso.<br> Watch out for Fatso.<br> He'll try to crack you.<br> And if they put you in the hole,<br> don't yell.<br> Don't make a sound.<br> You'll still be yelling<br> when they come to take you out.<br> Just lay there.<br> Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.<br> He's dead.<br> I'll betcha that's Prewitt.<br> Sergeant Judson?<br> You want me?<br> Yeah, Fatso.<br> I don't like that nickname.<br> You want to see me about something?<br> Let's step around the corner<br> where we can talk.<br> Okay.<br> - Are you sore about something?<br> - I don't like the way you play the piano.<br> - Remember Maggio?<br> - Oh, the wop?<br> Yeah, a real tough monkey.<br> - You killed him.<br> - Did I?<br> Well, if I did, he asked for it.<br> The army's gonna get you<br> sooner or later, Fatso.<br> But before they do,<br> I want a piece of you myself.<br> I figured that.<br> See this knife?<br> It's the one you pulled on Maggio.<br> Prew!<br> What's...<br> Prew!<br> It's all right.<br> Don't worry, don't worry.<br> I ain't gonna die.<br> First platoon all present and accounted for!<br> Second platoon all present<br> and accounted for!<br> First platoon all present and accounted for!<br> Second platoon all present<br> and accounted for!<br> Third platoon all present and accounted for!<br> First platoon all present and accounted for!<br> Company dismissed!<br> Prewitt's still absent.<br> Makes three days now.<br> How long are you gonna<br> carry him present, Top?<br> - I just mention it.<br> - Well, don't mention it.<br> "Upon observing these incidents,<br> "an investigation was made<br> by the Inspector General's department<br> "over a period of several months.<br> "It was found that Captain Holmes<br> has been guilty of indefensible cruelty<br> "to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.<br> "As mentioned, this included the instigation<br> of wholly unauthorized tactics<br> "to force the soldier to join<br> the inter-regiment boxing team."<br> I'm waiting for your reply.<br> I haven't any, sir.<br> Holmes,<br> the first thing I learned in the army<br> was that an officer takes care of his men.<br> It seems to be the first thing that you forgot.<br> My only regret is that<br> we have to keep you in uniform<br> until a court-martial is concluded.<br> If there were any way<br> to avoid a court-martial, sir.<br> There is one alternative, General,<br> if you are so disposed.<br> A resignation for the good of the service,<br> under army regulations.<br> Write a letter of resignation.<br> Have it on my desk this afternoon.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> the quicker you're out of the army,<br> the better for everybody,<br> especially the army.<br> That's all, Holmes.<br> I know what's been going on in this outfit.<br> I know how far some of you<br> have been out of line.<br> If you want to remain noncoms,<br> you'd better snap into it.<br> And another thing, from now on,<br> no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing.<br> - Get rid of those.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Dismissed.<br> - About Sergeant Galovitch.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Bust him.<br> Sergeant Galovitch is now Private Galovitch.<br> Put him in charge of the latrine.<br> What are you grinning at?<br> I think the company commander<br> made a wise decision, sir.<br> Company "G," Captain Ross.<br> - Just a minute. It's for you, Sergeant.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Yes, sir?<br> Yes, the parcel has already arrived.<br> What?<br> I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.<br> Okay, I'll get away somehow.<br> Sure, that'd be fine.<br> Yeah. I'll be there in about an hour.<br> Right.<br> He's being sent back to the States.<br> He's sailing next week.<br> He wants me to go with him. What'll we do?<br> When do you think<br> you'll get your commission?<br> I didn't put it in.<br> I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.<br> I took it out of my desk a dozen times,<br> but I couldn't sign it.<br> Why?<br> But it was the plan.<br> - I know, I know.<br> - It's been weeks.<br> You can't just say you'll do a thing<br> and then not do it.<br> Karen, listen to me.<br> But why didn't you do it?<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> Be back in a minute.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought you were somebody else.<br> I thought it was a guy from our company,<br> Prewitt, the kid I was telling you about.<br> The one that got mixed up with<br> one of the girls at the New Congress Club.<br> He's A.W.O.L. Probably in lots of trouble.<br> Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no good...<br> Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.<br> I can't be anything else.<br> If I try to be an officer,<br> I'll be putting on an act.<br> I just can't do it.<br> Please don't ask me why.<br> I know why.<br> You don't have to become<br> an officer now, Milt,<br> now that Dana's out of the army.<br> You just don't want to marry me.<br> You're already married to the army.<br> I love you, Karen.<br> I know. I know.<br> I don't want you to go back to Holmes.<br> I don't want to either, but I am.<br> There's nothing else for me to do.<br> It's no good with us, Milt.<br> It could never have been any good.<br> Hiding and sneaking.<br> It had to wear out.<br> Goodbye, Sergeant.<br> - Thanks.<br> - It ain't goodbye. It's...<br> We'll see each other again somewhere.<br> Of course we will.<br> Somewhere.<br> Here it is.<br> Got it on an inside page already.<br> "Still no clue in the fatal stabbing<br> of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."<br> Did you hear me?<br> - Trying to set a new world's record?<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.<br> To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt,<br> holder of the new world's record.<br> - Everything all right, Top?<br> - Great.<br> This is a beautiful meal<br> to put in front of a guy on a Sunday morning.<br> Congratulations.<br> - Sure look pretty over them mountains.<br> - Don't they, though?<br> Sounds like they're dynamiting<br> down at Wheeler Field.<br> Mighty ambitious, huh?<br> Sunday morning before 8:00?<br> The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!<br> I seen the red circles on the...<br> Come on, get inside!
