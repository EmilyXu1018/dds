                        There are more than yesterday.<br> He will be saying prayers in<br> the garden. Just follow the others.<br> He will be saying prayers in<br> the garden. Just follow the others.<br> Brother, Bapu is already<br> late for prayers.<br> Oh, God!<br> The object of this massive tribute...<br> ...died as he had always lived:<br> A private man...<br> ...without wealth...<br> ...without property...<br> ...without official title or office.<br> Mahatma Gandhi...<br> ...was not the commander of armies...<br> ...nor a ruler of vast lands.<br> He could not boast<br> any scientific achievement...<br> ...or artistic gift.<br> Yet men...<br> ...governments, dignitaries<br> from all over the world...<br> ...have joined hands today<br> to pay homage...<br> ...to this little brown man<br> in the loincloth...<br> ...who led his country to freedom.<br> In the words of<br> General George C. Marshall...<br> ...the American secretary of state:<br> "Mahatma Gandhi has become<br> the spokesman...<br> ...for the conscience of all mankind.<br> He was a man...<br> ...who made humility...<br> ...and simple truth...<br> ...more powerful than empires."<br> And Albert Einstein added:<br> "Generations to come will scarce<br> believe that such a one as this...<br> ...ever in flesh and blood...<br> ...walked upon this earth."<br> Tell me...<br> ...do you think about hell?<br> No, neither do I.<br> But this man here...<br> ...is a Christian, and he's written<br> that in order to believe...<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> How long have you been<br> in South Africa?<br> A week.<br> I don't know how you got a ticket.<br> Just what are you doing<br> in this car, coolie?<br> Why, I have a ticket.<br> A first-class ticket.<br> - How did you get it?<br> - I sent for it in the post.<br> I'm an attorney.<br> I didn't...<br> There are no coloured attorneys<br> in South Africa.<br> Sit where you belong!<br> I'll take your luggage back, sir.<br> Just a moment, please.<br> You see?<br> Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.<br> I'm going to conduct a case<br> for an Indian trading firm.<br> Didn't you hear me? There are no<br> coloured attorneys in South Africa.<br> I was called to the bar in London...<br> ...and enrolled at<br> the High Court of Chancery.<br> I am, therefore, an attorney.<br> And since I am,<br> in your eyes, coloured...<br> ...I think we can deduce<br> that there is at least...<br> ...one coloured attorney<br> in South Africa.<br> Smart bloody Kaffir!<br> Throw him out.<br> Just move your black ass<br> back to third class...<br> ...or I'll have you thrown off<br> at the next station.<br> But I always go first class!<br> But you're a rich man.<br> Why put up with it?<br> Yes, I am rich. But I am Indian.<br> I do not expect<br> to travel first class.<br> - In England, I was a poor student.<br> - That was England.<br> This is part of England's Empire.<br> Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and<br> you see a successful Muslim trader.<br> Most South Africans see him<br> simply as an Indian.<br> And the vast majority of Indians,<br> mostly Hindus, like yourself...<br> ...were brought here to<br> work mines and harvest crops.<br> Most Europeans don't want them<br> doing anything else.<br> But that is very unchristian...<br> Mr. Gandhi, in this country...<br> ...lndians are not allowed to walk<br> along the pavement with a Christian.<br> You mean, you employ Mr. Baker<br> as your attorney...<br> ...but you can't walk down<br> the street with him?<br> Well, I can.<br> But I risk being kicked<br> into the gutter by someone...<br> ...less holy than Mr. Baker.<br> Well, then it must be fought.<br> We are children of God<br> like everyone else.<br> Allah be praised!<br> And what battalions<br> will you call upon?<br> I will write to the press...<br> ...here and in England.<br> I will use the courts.<br> You'll cause a lot of trouble.<br> Our position is...<br> We are members of the Empire.<br> And we come from<br> an ancient civilization.<br> Why should we not walk on<br> the pavements like other men?<br> I rather like the idea of<br> an Indian barrister in South Africa.<br> I'm sure our community could<br> keep you in work for some time...<br> ...even if you caused<br> a good deal of trouble.<br> Especially if you caused<br> a good deal of trouble.<br> There's the English reporter.<br> I told you he'd come.<br> You also said your article<br> would draw a thousand people.<br> At least some of the Hindus<br> brought their wives.<br> No, I asked my wife<br> to organize that.<br> Some of them are leaving.<br> "Ladies and gentlemen:<br> We have asked you to gather here<br> to help us proclaim our right...<br> ...to be treated as equal citizens<br> of the Empire.<br> We do not seek conflict.<br> We know the strength of<br> the forces arrayed against us...<br> ...know that because of them,<br> we can only use peaceful means.<br> But we are determined<br> that justice will be done.<br> The symbol of our status<br> is embodied in this pass...<br> ...which we must carry<br> at all times...<br> ...but which no European<br> even has to have.<br> The first step towards<br> changing our status...<br> ...is to eliminate<br> this difference between us."<br> Now?<br> You write brilliantly, but you have<br> much to learn about handling men.<br> "We do not want to ignite...<br> ...the fear or hatred of anyone.<br> But we ask you...<br> ...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...<br> ...to help us light up the sky...<br> ...and the minds of<br> the British authorities...<br> ...with our defiance<br> of this injustice."<br> We will now burn the passes of<br> our committee and its supporters.<br> We ask you to put<br> your passes on the fire...<br> You bloody dog!<br> Those passes...<br> ...are government property!<br> And I will arrest the first man<br> who tries to burn one!<br> Take him away.<br> You little...<br> ...Sammy...<br> ...bastard!<br> Now! Are there any more?<br> If you want this kind of trouble,<br> you can have it.<br> Let me go!<br> Let me go!<br> Stop.<br> The London papers have<br> arrived from the Cape.<br> The worst was the Daily Mail.<br> They said the burning of passes...<br> - Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.<br> ...-was the most significant act...<br> ...in colonial affairs since<br> the Declaration of Independence.<br> They'll find we're better<br> prepared this time.<br> Mr. Gandhi will find<br> he's on a long hiding to nothing.<br> "A High Court judge confirmed<br> that Mr. Gandhi...<br> ...would've been within his rights<br> to prosecute for assault...<br> ...since neither he nor Mr. Khan<br> resisted arrest."<br> I told you about English law.<br> As I told you about English policemen.<br> Yes?<br> We're very pleased<br> to have you back, Papa.<br> And I am glad to be back.<br> Come.<br> Mind your face.<br> Tomorrow I'll tell you about<br> my days in a police hospital.<br> Come, come.<br> Just like proper English gentlemen.<br> I'm proud of them.<br> They're boys and they're Indian.<br> Will you take this off?<br> It pinches every time I speak.<br> I've got it.<br> You'd be Gandhi.<br> I thought you'd be bigger.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - No, that's all right.<br> My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.<br> I've come from India.<br> I've read a great deal about you.<br> Some of it good, I hope.<br> Would you care to walk?<br> You're a clergyman?<br> I met some remarkable people in India.<br> And when I read what you were doing,<br> I wanted to help.<br> - Does that surprise you?<br> - Not anymore.<br> At first, I was amazed...<br> ...but when you're fighting<br> in a just cause...<br> ...people seem to pop up, like you,<br> right out of the pavement.<br> Even when it's dangerous or...<br> Hey, look what's coming!<br> A white shepherd leading<br> a brown Sammy!<br> Perhaps we should...<br> Doesn't the New Testament say:<br> "If your enemy strikes you on<br> the right cheek, offer him the left"?<br> The phrase was used metaphorically.<br> I don't think our Lord...<br> I'm not so sure.<br> I have thought about it a great deal.<br> I suspect He meant<br> you must show courage...<br> ...be willing to take a blow,<br> several blows, to show...<br> ...you won't strike back,<br> nor will you be turned aside.<br> And when you do that, it calls on<br> something in human nature...<br> ...that makes his hatred for you<br> decrease and his respect increase.<br> I think Christ grasped that,<br> and I have seen it work.<br> Good morning.<br> Get off the pavement,<br> you bloody coon.<br> - Yeah, get off.<br> - Kaffir!<br> Colin, what you doing?<br> Nothing.<br> Come out where I can see you!<br> I said, what you doing?<br> We were just trying<br> to clean up the neighbourhood.<br> You're late for work.<br> I thought you'd gone 1 0 minutes ago.<br> Get on!<br> You'll find there's room for us all.<br> - That was lucky.<br> - I thought you were a man of God.<br> I am, but I'm not<br> so egotistical as to think...<br> ...He plans His day<br> around my dilemmas.<br> You could call it<br> a communal farm, I suppose.<br> But you've all come<br> to the same conclusions.<br> Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,<br> your Bible.<br> It's always the simple things<br> that catch your breath.<br> "Love thy neighbour as thyself."<br> Not always practised...<br> ...but it's something we Hindus<br> could learn a lot from.<br> That's the kind of thing<br> you'll be seeking on this farm?<br> Well, we shall try.<br> Bad news, I'm afraid.<br> They're going to change the pass laws.<br> It's taken time...<br> ...but it needed to be done fairly.<br> We didn't want to create an injustice<br> simply because Mr. Gandhi...<br> ...was abusing our<br> existing legislation.<br> Just one moment, sir, please.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> But on a short trip...<br> ...I wouldn't spend too much time<br> on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.<br> It's a tiny factor<br> in South Africa.<br> Well, it is news at the moment.<br> I plan to report on<br> the condition of the mines here...<br> ...as well as the economy.<br> - Good.<br> But I would like to meet<br> this Mr. Gand-eye.<br> Gandhi.<br> Of course.<br> We Westerners have a weakness...<br> ...for these spiritually inclined<br> men of India.<br> But as an old lawyer,<br> let me warn you.<br> Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man<br> as you will ever meet...<br> ...however otherworldly he may seem.<br> But I'm sure you're enough<br> of a reporter to see that.<br> I hope so.<br> Thank you for your time, sir.<br> So it's not spiritualism<br> or nationalism.<br> We're not resisting anything but the<br> idea that people can't live together.<br> You see?<br> Hindus, Muslims...<br> ...Sikhs, Jews...<br> ...even Christians.<br> Mr. Walker of the New York Times.<br> How you doing?<br> Without a paper,<br> a journal of some kind...<br> ...you cannot unite a community.<br> You belong to a<br> very important profession.<br> And what do you think an important<br> professional should write...<br> ...about your response to<br> General Smuts' newest legislation?<br> I don't know.<br> I'm still searching for a response.<br> You will respect the law?<br> There are unjust laws<br> as there are unjust men.<br> You're a small minority to take on<br> the South African government...<br> ...not to mention the British Empire.<br> If you are a minority of one...<br> ...the truth is the truth.<br> Herman Kallenbach...<br> ...our chief carpenter,<br> also our chief benefactor.<br> Vince Walker, New York Times.<br> This is quite a place<br> you've got here.<br> And you call it an ashram?<br> That's right.<br> The word only means "community."<br> But it could stand for<br> "village" or "the world."<br> You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.<br> I hope not.<br> I hear that you also prepare<br> the meals and clean the toilets.<br> - Is that part of the experiment?<br> - Ba!<br> We will need another place set<br> for Mr. Walker's driver.<br> I will tell Tara.<br> Yes, it's one way to learn<br> that each man's labour...<br> ...is as important as another's.<br> While you're doing it,<br> cleaning the toilet...<br> ...seems far more important<br> than the law.<br> Please, come and join us.<br> You'll need something before<br> your journey back.<br> - Would you excuse me, please?<br> - Yeah, sure.<br> What is it?<br> Sora was sent to tell me I must...<br> ...rake and cover the latrine.<br> That's right.<br> Everyone takes their turn.<br> It is the work of untouchables!<br> In this place,<br> there are no untouchables...<br> ...and no work is beneath any of us.<br> I'm your wife!<br> All the more reason.<br> As you command.<br> The others may follow you,<br> but you forget...<br> ...I knew you when you were a boy.<br> It's not me.<br> It's the principle.<br> And you will do it with joy<br> or not do it at all.<br> Not at all then.<br> All right then, go.<br> You don't belong here!<br> Go and leave the ashram altogether.<br> We don't want you!<br> Have you no shame?<br> I'm your wife!<br> Where do you expect me to go?<br> What's the matter with me?<br> You're human.<br> Only human.<br> And it's even harder<br> for those of us...<br> ...who do not even want to be<br> as good as you do.<br> I apologize.<br> I must get back to that reporter.<br> And I must...<br> ...rake and cover the latrine.<br> I want to welcome you all.<br> Every one of you.<br> We have no secrets.<br> Let us begin by being clear...<br> ...about General Smuts' new law.<br> All Indians must now<br> be fingerprinted...<br> ...like criminals.<br> Men and women.<br> No marriage other than a Christian<br> marriage is considered valid.<br> Under this act...<br> ...our wives and mothers are whores.<br> And every man here is a bastard.<br> He has become quite good at this.<br> And a policeman...<br> ...passing an Indian dwelling...<br> ...I will not call them homes...<br> ...may enter and demand the card of any<br> Indian woman whose dwelling it is.<br> Goddamn them!<br> Understand...<br> ...he does not have to<br> stand at the door.<br> He may enter.<br> I will not allow it!<br> I swear to Allah.<br> I'll kill the man who offers<br> that insult to my home and my wife...<br> ...and let them hang me!<br> I say: Talk means nothing!<br> Kill a few officials before<br> they disgrace one Indian woman.<br> Then they might think twice<br> about such laws.<br> In that cause,<br> I would be willing to die!<br> I praise such courage.<br> I need such courage...<br> ...because, in this cause,<br> I too am prepared to die.<br> But, my friend...<br> ...there is no cause for which<br> I am prepared to kill.<br> Whatever they do to us...<br> ...we will attack no one...<br> ...kill no one.<br> But we will not give<br> our fingerprints, not one of us.<br> They will imprison us. They will fine<br> us. They will seize our possessions.<br> But they cannot take away<br> our self-respect...<br> ...if we do not give it to them.<br> Have you been to prison?<br> They beat us and torture us.<br> I say...<br> I am asking you to fight.<br> To fight against their anger,<br> not to provoke it.<br> We will not strike a blow.<br> But we will receive them.<br> And through our pain...<br> ...we will make them see<br> their injustice.<br> And it will hurt...<br> ...as all fighting hurts.<br> But we cannot lose.<br> We cannot.<br> They may torture my body...<br> ...break my bones...<br> ...even kill me.<br> Then...<br> ...they will have my dead body...<br> ...not my obedience.<br> We are Hindu and Muslim...<br> ...children of God, each one of us.<br> Let us take a solemn oath<br> in His name...<br> ...that, come what may...<br> ...we will not submit to this law.<br> God save our gracious King<br> God save our noble King<br> God save our King<br> These men are contracted labourers.<br> They belong in the mines.<br> You put their comrades in jail.<br> When you free them...<br> ...they will go back to work.<br> I've warned you.<br> We've warned each other.<br> I don't think that's very good.<br> Steady, steady.<br> Stop!<br> At the canter, charge!<br> We should lie down.<br> Down!<br> The horses won't trample on us.<br> Lie down!<br> Follow me! Follow me!<br> Now what the hell do we do?<br> Let them march.<br> In our own sweet time,<br> in our own sweet way...<br> ...we'll get them.<br> One law!<br> One king!<br> One law!<br> One king!<br> Some of you may be rejoicing that<br> Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.<br> But I would ask you, assembled<br> here in this house of God...<br> ...to recognize that we are<br> witnessing something new...<br> ...something so unexpected,<br> so unusual...<br> ...that it is not surprising<br> the government is at a loss.<br> What Mr. Gandhi has forced us to do...<br> ...is ask questions about ourselves.<br> As Christians, those are<br> difficult questions to answer.<br> How do we treat men<br> who defy an unjust law...<br> ...who will not fight...<br> ...but will not comply?<br> As Christians, or as people<br> who have not heard the word...<br> They're sparing no one, I see.<br> No, you were the surprise.<br> It has been all over the prison.<br> We thought they'd be too afraid<br> of the English press.<br> So did I.<br> I don't know who they've<br> left out there to do the work.<br> Have they touched the women?<br> My wife publicly defied the law.<br> They've arrested her and four others.<br> It split the government.<br> Well, that's one victory.<br> If we hold firm,<br> it won't be the last.<br> Don't worry.<br> I've never seen men so determined.<br> You have given them a way to fight.<br> Gandhi!<br> I want Gandhi!<br> Which Sammy is it?<br> Mr. Gandhi.<br> I thought we might have<br> a little talk.<br> Thank you, Daniels.<br> Will you have a glass of sherry?<br> Thank you, no.<br> Perhaps some tea?<br> I dined at the prison.<br> Please, do come and sit down.<br> I've more or less decided to ask<br> the House to repeal the act...<br> ...that you have taken<br> such exception to.<br> Well, if you asked, General Smuts,<br> I'm sure it will be done.<br> It's not quite that simple.<br> Somehow, I expected not.<br> I thought of calling for<br> a royal commission...<br> ...to investigate the new legislation.<br> I think I could guarantee they would<br> recommend the act be repealed.<br> I congratulate them.<br> But they might also recommend...<br> ...that all future Indian immigration<br> be severely restricted...<br> ...even stopped.<br> Immigration was not an issue<br> on which we fought.<br> It would be wrong of us<br> to make it one, now that we...<br> We are in a position of advantage.<br> I'm ordering the release of all<br> prisoners within the next 24 hours.<br> You yourself are free<br> as from this moment.<br> Assuming we are in agreement.<br> Yes, yes.<br> It's just that in these clothes,<br> I would prefer to go by taxi.<br> All right. Fine.<br> I'm afraid I have no money.<br> Neither have I.<br> I'm awfully sorry.<br> Daniels...<br> ...will you lend Mr. Gandhi<br> a shilling for a taxi?<br> I beg your pardon, sir?<br> How far will you be going, Gandhi?<br> Now that this is settled, I'd thought<br> seriously of going back to India.<br> But a shilling will do splendidly<br> for the moment.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...<br> ...but I can find my own way out.<br> Guard of honour!<br> Guard of honour!<br> Attention!<br> Present arms!<br> - My God, he loves it!<br> - I'm sure he hates it.<br> Generals' reputations are<br> being made in France today...<br> ...fighting on the Western front.<br> Not as military governors in India.<br> What the devil's going on back there?<br> Must be that Indian who made<br> all that fuss in Africa.<br> My cabin boy told me he was onboard.<br> There he is.<br> God, he's dressed like a coolie!<br> I thought he was a lawyer.<br> Mr. Gandhi, have you refused<br> to wear European clothes?<br> No, I haven't refused.<br> I simply wanted to dress the way<br> my comrades in prison dress.<br> Will you support the war effort?<br> If I wish to enjoy the benefits<br> and protection of the British Empire...<br> ...it would be wrong of me<br> not to help in its defence.<br> Now that you're back in India,<br> what will you do?<br> I don't know.<br> - I don't know.<br> - One more question.<br> As an Indian woman, how could you<br> accept the indignity of prison?<br> My dignity comes<br> from following my husband.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Just a few words, then we'll<br> get you to civilization.<br> May I?<br> I'm glad to be home...<br> ...and I thank you for your greeting.<br> I'll follow with your wife.<br> Don't worry.<br> Everything's arranged.<br> Who's that young man?<br> That's young Nehru.<br> He's got his father's intellect,<br> his mother's good looks...<br> ...and the devil's own charm.<br> If they don't ruin him at Cambridge...<br> Wave, wave!<br> He might amount to something.<br> I must say, when I first saw you as<br> a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...<br> ...I never thought I'd greet you<br> as a national hero.<br> I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.<br> Yes, you are!<br> It's been 200 years<br> since an Indian cocked a snook...<br> ...at the British Empire<br> and got away with it.<br> And stop calling me Mr. Patel.<br> You're not a junior clerk anymore.<br> The new military governor of the<br> Northwest Province was on that ship.<br> Too bad you came back third class.<br> He might have been impressed...<br> ...by a successful barrister<br> who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.<br> Yes, I'm sure.<br> Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?<br> No. I leave practical matters<br> to my husband...<br> ...and revolution to my son.<br> Mr. Gandhi, I'd like you to meet<br> Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...<br> ...member of congress and leader<br> of the Muslim League...<br> How do you do?<br> And Mr. Prakash, who, I fear...<br> ...is awaiting trial for sedition<br> and inducement to murder.<br> I have not actually pulled<br> the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.<br> I have simply written...<br> ...if an Englishman kills an Indian<br> for disobeying his law...<br> ...it is an Indian's duty<br> to kill an Englishman...<br> ...for enforcing his law<br> in a land that is not his.<br> It's a clever argument. It may not<br> produce the end you desire.<br> We hope you'll join us in our<br> struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.<br> Excuse me. May l, Mohan?<br> There's someone I'd like him to meet.<br> Excuse me.<br> Sorry to rush you.<br> He told the press<br> he'd support the British in the war.<br> That's nonviolence for you.<br> You know, Mohan...<br> ...now I have a confession to make.<br> I didn't decide to come<br> to South Africa.<br> Professor Gokhale sent me.<br> We are trying<br> to make a nation, Gandhi.<br> But the British keep trying<br> to break us up...<br> ...into religions,<br> principalities, provinces.<br> What you were writing<br> in South Africa...<br> ...that's what we need here.<br> I have so much to learn about India.<br> And I have to begin my practice again.<br> One needs money to run a journal.<br> Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.<br> This is Indian talk.<br> We want none of you imperialists here.<br> All right, I'll go<br> and write my report to the viceroy.<br> You go and find a pretty Hindu woman...<br> ...and convert her to Christianity.<br> That's as much mischief<br> as you're allowed.<br> Come, let's find a quiet corner.<br> Now, you forget about your practice.<br> You have other things to do.<br> India has many men<br> with too much wealth.<br> And it's their privilege to nourish<br> the effort of the few...<br> ...who can raise India<br> from servitude and apathy.<br> I'll see to it.<br> You begin your journal.<br> I have little to say.<br> Come, let's sit down.<br> India is an alien country to me.<br> Change that.<br> Go and find India.<br> Not what you see here...<br> ...but the real India.<br> You'll see what needs to be said...<br> ...what we need to hear.<br> When I saw you in that tunic, I knew.<br> I knew I could die in peace.<br> Make India proud of herself.<br> Charlie, please.<br> You're both being foolish.<br> But the air is lovely.<br> Anyway, there's no room in there.<br> Please! Come in.<br> No violence, please.<br> Let me hang on with two hands<br> or I will fall.<br> Englishman, sahib!<br> Come, there is room up here!<br> Put your foot on the window.<br> Come!<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I'm going nearer to God.<br> Charlie! Be careful!<br> Let go. Let go!<br> - Let go!<br> - Oh, dear!<br> Hello.<br> You see?<br> It is most comfortable.<br> Sahib?<br> Are you a Christian?<br> Yes, I'm a Christian.<br> I know a Christian.<br> She drinks blood.<br> Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.<br> Charlie!<br> It's all right, sahib.<br> It's very safe.<br> Bend!<br> Pray to God, sahib.<br> Now is when it is best to be Hindu.<br> I agree with Jinnah.<br> Now that the Americans are in,<br> the war will be over soon.<br> The Germans are worn out as it is.<br> And our first act should be...<br> ...to convene<br> a congress party convention...<br> ...and demand independence.<br> And we will speak<br> with one voice, united.<br> And we should invite Gandhi.<br> What the devil's happened to him?<br> He's discovering India.<br> Which is better than<br> making trouble where it matters.<br> Invite him, let him say his piece<br> about South Africa...<br> ...then let him slip into oblivion.<br> Insurgents.<br> They've derailed a troop train.<br> Keep clear!<br> Come on.<br> They've killed an English soldier.<br> We were asked for toleration.<br> We were asked for patience.<br> Some of us gave it...<br> ...and some did not.<br> Their war is over.<br> And those of us who supported it...<br> ...and those of us who refused...<br> ...must forget our differences.<br> And there can be no excuses...<br> ...from the British now.<br> India wants...<br> ...home rule.<br> India...<br> ...demands home rule!<br> Congratulations.<br> And let no one question...<br> ...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...<br> ...not just for the Muslims...<br> ...but for all India!<br> And now...<br> ...l'm going to introduce to you...<br> ...a man whose writings...<br> ...we are all becoming familiar with.<br> A man who stood in high esteem<br> with our own beloved Gokhale.<br> A man whose accomplishments in<br> South Africa will always be remembered.<br> Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!<br> Your journal has made great impact.<br> I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.<br> I would be even more flattered<br> if what he said were true.<br> But it is true.<br> I read it. Often!<br> Since I returned from South Africa...<br> ...l've travelled over much of India.<br> And I know that I could travel<br> for many more years...<br> ...and still only see<br> a small part of her.<br> And yet, I already know...<br> ...that what we say here...<br> ...means nothing to<br> the masses of our country.<br> Here, we make speeches<br> for each other...<br> ...and those English liberal magazines<br> that may grant us a few lines.<br> But the people of India...<br> ...are...<br> ...untouched.<br> Their politics are confined to bread...<br> ...and salt.<br> Illiterate they may be,<br> but they're not blind.<br> They see no reason to give their<br> loyalty to rich and powerful men...<br> ...who simply want to take over<br> the role of the British...<br> ...in the name of freedom.<br> This congress tells the world...<br> ...it represents India.<br> My brothers...<br> ...lndia...<br> ...is 700,000 villages...<br> ...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...<br> ...and Bombay.<br> Until we stand in the fields...<br> ...with the millions that toil<br> each day under the hot sun...<br> ...we will not represent India.<br> Nor will we ever be able<br> to challenge the British...<br> ...as one nation.<br> Have you read his magazine?<br> No.<br> But I think I'm going to.<br> Pull over.<br> This can't be the way.<br> Yes, I'm sure this is<br> the direction India is taking.<br> To think I almost got<br> excited by Mr. Jinnah...<br> ...when all this was awaiting me.<br> We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.<br> - You'll find him under that tree.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm anxious to meet this new force.<br> I try to live like an Indian,<br> as you see.<br> It's stupid, of course.<br> Because in our country...<br> ...it is the British who decide<br> how an Indian lives...<br> ...what he may buy, what he may sell.<br> And from their luxury...<br> ...in the midst<br> of our terrible poverty...<br> ...they instruct us on<br> what is justice, what is sedition.<br> So it's only natural<br> that our best young minds...<br> ...assume an air of Eastern dignity...<br> ...while greedily assimilating...<br> ...every Western weakness as quickly<br> as they can acquire it.<br> If we have home rule...<br> ...that'll change.<br> Would you, please?<br> Why should the British<br> grant us home rule?<br> We must take<br> the peelings to the goats.<br> We only make wild speeches or<br> perform even wilder acts of terrorism.<br> We've bred an army of anarchists...<br> ...but not one group that can<br> fight the British anywhere.<br> Hello! Hello!<br> But I thought you were<br> against fighting.<br> Now just spread it around.<br> There you are.<br> They like the new peelings<br> mixed in with the rotting ones.<br> Where there's injustice,<br> I always believed in fighting.<br> The question is, do you fight<br> to change things or to punish?<br> I've found we're all such sinners,<br> we should leave punishment to God.<br> And if we really want<br> to change things...<br> ...there are better ways<br> of doing it...<br> ...than derailing trains<br> or slashing someone with a sword.<br> The fire is ready.<br> You see, even here...<br> ...we live under tyranny.<br> What did I tell you?<br> Look at him!<br> I can see the British shaking now.<br> Hello!<br> I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.<br> I've been trying to speak<br> to you for a long time.<br> Our crops.<br> We cannot sell them.<br> We have no money.<br> But the landlords still<br> demand the same rent.<br> We have nothing left.<br> Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!<br> Jesus!<br> What the hell is going on?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> The agent got a telegram.<br> And it just said, "He is coming,"<br> and gave the time of the train.<br> Who the hell is "he"?<br> I don't know, sir.<br> Out of the way.<br> Come on, you!<br> - Who the devil are you?<br> - My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.<br> Whoever you are,<br> we don't want you here.<br> I suggest you get back on<br> that train before it leaves.<br> They seem to want me.<br> Now, look here.<br> I'll put you under arrest<br> if you'd prefer.<br> On what charge?<br> I don't want any trouble.<br> I'm an Indian travelling in my own<br> country. I see no reason for trouble.<br> Well, there had better not be.<br> Make way for the officer.<br> For years...<br> ...the landlords have ordered us...<br> ...to grow indigo...<br> ...for dyeing cloth.<br> Always, they took part<br> of the crop as rent.<br> But now...<br> ...everyone buys their cloth<br> from England.<br> So no one wants...<br> ...our indigo.<br> The landlords...<br> ...say we must pay our rent...<br> ...in cash.<br> What we could...<br> ...we sold.<br> The police have taken the rest.<br> There is...<br> ...no food.<br> I understand.<br> The landlords are British?<br> What we can do, we will try to do.<br> Shukla...<br> ...is all Champaran like this?<br> Yes, Bapu.<br> The whole region.<br> Hundreds.<br> Thousands.<br> Some landlords have tried to help.<br> But what can they do?<br> - Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry, you're under arrest.<br> I'm not sorry at all.<br> Who did you say<br> would be buying the drinks?<br> Oh, no!<br> Wouldn't you know, that's the best<br> innings I've had since Oxford.<br> India's full of grief, old man.<br> I've got no idea.<br> All I know is there's a riot or<br> something at Motihari in Champaran.<br> The whole company's ordered out.<br> I would like to see the prisoner.<br> On the left, sir.<br> Shades of South Africa.<br> Not quite.<br> They're only holding me...<br> ...until the magistrate's hearing.<br> Then it will be prison.<br> Did they take your clothes?<br> These are my clothes now.<br> You always had<br> a puritanical streak, Mohan.<br> If I want to be one with them...<br> ...I have to live like them.<br> Yes, I think you do.<br> But thank God we all don't.<br> My puritanism runs in a different way.<br> I'm far too modest for such a display.<br> Couldn't I be let in with<br> the prisoner? I am a clergyman.<br> They're calling you "Bapu."<br> I thought it meant "father."<br> It does.<br> We must be getting old, Charlie.<br> What do you want me to do?<br> I think that you can help us most...<br> ...by taking that assignment<br> you've been offered in Fiji.<br> I have to be sure...<br> They have to be sure<br> that what we do...<br> ...can be done by Indians alone.<br> But you know the strategy.<br> The world is full of people who<br> will despise what's happening here.<br> It is their strength that we need.<br> Before you go...<br> ...you could start us<br> in the right direction.<br> I must leave from Calcutta...<br> ...and soon.<br> Say goodbye to Ba for me.<br> Well, I...<br> There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.<br> Wherever you are,<br> you will always be in my heart.<br> I'm going to clear the courtroom.<br> I'm not sure we'd be able to.<br> It is a first hearing.<br> It's supposed to be public.<br> And he's a lawyer.<br> I don't know where<br> they found the nerve.<br> I don't either, but the troops<br> won't be here till tomorrow.<br> How did the press get here<br> before the military?<br> That English clergyman sent<br> a number of telegrams yesterday.<br> I understand one of them<br> even went to the viceroy.<br> You have been ordered<br> out of the province...<br> ...on the grounds<br> of disturbing the peace.<br> With respect, I refuse to go.<br> Do you want to go to jail?<br> As you wish.<br> All right.<br> I will release you on bail...<br> ...of 1 00 rupees<br> until I reach a sentence.<br> I refuse to pay 1 00 rupees.<br> Then I will grant release on bail...<br> ...without payment<br> until I reach a decision.<br> Gandhiji! Gandhiji!<br> We are from Bihar.<br> We received a cable<br> from an old friend...<br> ...who was at Cambridge with us.<br> His name is Nehru.<br> - I believe you know him.<br> - Indeed.<br> He tells us you need help,<br> and we have come to give it.<br> I want to document coldly, rationally,<br> what is being done here.<br> It may take months.<br> We have no pressing engagements.<br> You will have to live<br> with the peasants.<br> There will be risks.<br> I don't know what<br> this country's coming to.<br> But good God, man!<br> You yourself raised the rent simply<br> to finance a hunting expedition.<br> And some of these others:<br> beatings, illegal seizures...<br> ...demanding services without pay.<br> Even refusing them water.<br> In India!<br> Nobody knows what it is to try<br> to get these people to work.<br> You've made this half-naked<br> whatever-he-is...<br> ...into an international hero.<br> "One lone man, marching dusty roads,<br> armed only with honesty...<br> ...and a bamboo staff, doing battle<br> with the British Empire."<br> At home, children are<br> writing essays about him.<br> What do they want?<br> Gareth!<br> Yes, sir.<br> There's a rebate on rents paid.<br> They're to be free to grow crops<br> of their own choice.<br> And a commission, part Indian,<br> to hear grievances.<br> That would satisfy him?<br> And His Majesty's government.<br> It only needs your signature<br> for the landlords.<br> It'll be worth it<br> to see the back of him.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - We're too damned liberal.<br> - Perhaps.<br> At least this has made the government<br> see some sense about what men...<br> ...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,<br> and what they should be denied.<br> Where is Mr. Gandhi?<br> He said he preferred to walk, sir.<br> I followed him most of the way.<br> He's just turned the corner.<br> He came third class.<br> God, give me patience.<br> My house is honoured.<br> The honour is ours.<br> I'd like you to meet<br> Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.<br> He's interested in flowers. I told<br> him he could wander your garden.<br> I'll send for my gardener.<br> You'll have plenty to discuss.<br> Thank you.<br> Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.<br> Only the stubborn man of Champaran.<br> Mr. Patel you know.<br> Maulana Azad, my colleague<br> and a fellow Muslim...<br> ...and just recently<br> released from prison.<br> Mr. Kripalani.<br> And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.<br> I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.<br> Please sit down. Do sit down.<br> Gentlemen, I've asked you to come<br> here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...<br> ...because I've had the chance<br> to see the legislation.<br> And it is exactly as was rumoured.<br> Arrest without warrant,<br> and automatic imprisonment...<br> ...for possession of materials<br> considered seditious.<br> And your writings<br> are specifically listed.<br> So much for helping them<br> in the Great War.<br> There is only one answer:<br> Direct action on a scale...<br> ...they can never handle.<br> I don't think so.<br> Terrorism would only justify<br> their repression.<br> And what kind of leaders<br> would it throw up?<br> Are they men that we'd want<br> at the head of our country?<br> I too have read<br> Mr. Gandhi's writings...<br> ...but I'd rather be ruled by an<br> Indian terrorist than an English one.<br> And I don't intend to submit<br> to that kind of law.<br> I must say, it seems to me...<br> ...that it's gone beyond remedies<br> like passive resistance.<br> If I may...<br> ...l, for one, have never<br> advocated passive anything.<br> I'm with Mr. Jinnah.<br> We must never submit to such laws...<br> ...ever.<br> And I think our resistance must be<br> active and provocative.<br> May I?<br> I want to embarrass all those<br> who wish to treat us as slaves.<br> Thank you.<br> All of them.<br> - Forgive my stupid illustration.<br> - Allow me.<br> No, please.<br> But I want to change their minds...<br> ...not kill them<br> for weaknesses we all possess.<br> And what resistance would you offer?<br> The law is due<br> to take effect from April 6.<br> I want to call upon the nation...<br> ...to make that a day of<br> prayer and fasting.<br> A general strike?<br> I mean a day of prayer and fasting.<br> Of course, no work could be done.<br> No buses.<br> No trains.<br> No factories.<br> No administration.<br> The country would stop.<br> My God, it would terrify them!<br> Even the English newspapers<br> would have to report that...<br> ...and explain why.<br> - But could we get people to do it?<br> - Why not?<br> Champaran stirred the whole country.<br> Thank you.<br> They're calling you "Mahatma."<br> "Great Soul."<br> Fortunately, such news comes<br> very slowly to where I live.<br> I think if we all worked<br> to publicize it...<br> ...all of congress...<br> ...every avenue we know...<br> I could get articles printed in most<br> of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.<br> Only civilians will visit.<br> Don't you think so, Your Highness?<br> Of course, the army will<br> always be loyal.<br> I'll have you know,<br> we've got 500 troops.<br> They'll be damn hungry by morning,<br> I'll tell you that.<br> Mr. Kinnoch.<br> Sir, I'm afraid it's confirmed.<br> Nothing's working, sir.<br> The buses, the trains, the markets.<br> There's not even any ordinary<br> civilian staff here, sir.<br> Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?<br> Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.<br> It's total.<br> The army had to take over<br> the telegraph...<br> ...or we'd be cut off from the world.<br> I can't believe it.<br> He's going to sell his own paper<br> tomorrow in Bombay, sir.<br> They've called for a parade<br> on Victoria Road.<br> Arrest him.<br> He's to go to the visitors' room.<br> Bapu.<br> You too?<br> It seems less formal than Mahatma.<br> Since your arrest,<br> the riots have hardly stopped.<br> Not big, but they keep breaking out.<br> I run to stop them.<br> And Patel and Kripalani,<br> they're never at rest.<br> But some English civilians<br> have been killed.<br> And the army is attacking<br> crowds with clubs.<br> Sometimes worse.<br> Maybe I'm wrong.<br> Maybe we're not ready yet.<br> In South Africa,<br> our numbers were small.<br> The government's afraid.<br> They don't know what to do.<br> They're more afraid<br> of terrorism than of you.<br> The viceroy's agreed to your release<br> if you will speak for nonviolence.<br> I've never spoken for anything else.<br> England...<br> ...is so powerful.<br> Its army...<br> ...and its navy...<br> ...all its modern weapons...<br> But when a great power like that...<br> ...strikes defenceless people...<br> ...it shows its brutality...<br> ...its own weakness.<br> Especially when those people<br> do not strike back.<br> Fighting back will not work.<br> And that is why the Mahatma...<br> ...begs us to take<br> the course of nonviolence.<br> Back away! Back away!<br> But if we riot...<br> ...if we fight back...<br> ...we become the vandals...<br> ...and they become the law.<br> If we bear their blows,<br> they are the vandals.<br> God and His law are on our...<br> Front rank, kneel in position!<br> We...<br> ...must have the courage...<br> ...to take their anger.<br> Should we issue a warning, sir?<br> They've had their warning:<br> No meetings.<br> Fire!<br> Take your time!<br> Corporal!<br> To your left.<br> General Dyer...<br> ...is it correct that you ordered<br> your troops to fire...<br> ...at the thickest part of the crowd?<br> That is so.<br> ...1 650 bullets.<br> My intention was<br> to inflict a lesson...<br> ...that would have an impact<br> throughout all India.<br> General...<br> ...had you been able to<br> take in the armoured car...<br> ...would you have opened fire<br> with the machine gun?<br> I think, probably, yes.<br> General, did you realize there were<br> children and women in the crowd?<br> I did.<br> But that was irrelevant<br> to the point you were making?<br> That is correct.<br> Could I ask you what provision<br> you made for the wounded?<br> I was ready to help any who applied.<br> General, how does a child...<br> ...shot with a.303 Lee-Enfield...<br> ...apply for help?<br> Forgive me, gentlemen,<br> but you must understand...<br> ...that His Majesty's government<br> and the British people repudiate...<br> ...both the massacre and<br> the philosophy that prompted it.<br> Now...<br> ...what I would like to do...<br> ...is to come to some compromise<br> over the new...<br> If you will excuse me,<br> Your Excellency...<br> ...it is our view that matters<br> have gone beyond legislation.<br> We think it is time you recognized...<br> ...that you are masters<br> in someone else's home.<br> Despite the best intentions<br> of the best of you...<br> ...you must, in the nature of things,<br> humiliate us to control us.<br> General Dyer is but an extreme<br> example of the principle.<br> It is time you left.<br> With respect, Mr. Gandhi...<br> ...without British administration...<br> ...this country would be<br> reduced to chaos.<br> Mr. Kinnoch...<br> ...I beg you to accept<br> that there is no people...<br> ...who would not prefer<br> their own bad government...<br> ...to the good government<br> of an alien power.<br> My dear sir, India is British.<br> We're hardly an alien power.<br> Even if His Majesty could waive<br> all other considerations...<br> ...he has a duty to the millions<br> of his Muslim subjects...<br> ...who are a minority in this realm.<br> And experience suggests<br> that his troops...<br> ...and his administration<br> are essential...<br> ...in order to secure the peace.<br> All nations contain<br> religious minorities.<br> Like other countries,<br> ours will have its problems.<br> But they will be ours...<br> ...not yours.<br> How do you propose<br> to make them yours?<br> You don't think we're just<br> going to walk out of India.<br> Yes.<br> In the end...<br> ...you will walk out...<br> ...because 1 00,000 Englishmen<br> simply cannot control...<br> ...350 million Indians<br> if those Indians refuse...<br> ...to cooperate.<br> And that is what<br> we intend to achieve.<br> Peaceful, nonviolent<br> noncooperation...<br> ...till you yourself<br> see the wisdom of leaving...<br> ...Your Excellency.<br> I said to him, "You don't<br> expect us just to walk out."<br> And he said, "Yes."<br> What an extraordinary little man,<br> isn't he?<br> "Nonviolence, noncooperation."<br> For a moment, I was afraid they were<br> actually going to do something.<br> Yes, but I think it would be wise<br> to be very cautious for a time.<br> The Antiterrorist Act<br> will remain on the statutes...<br> ...but on no account<br> is Gandhi to be arrested.<br> Whatever mischief he causes...<br> ...I have no intention<br> of making a martyr of him.<br> But now something worse is happening.<br> When Gandhiji and I were growing up...<br> ...women wove their own cloth.<br> But now there are millions<br> who have no work...<br> ...because those who can,<br> buy all they need from England.<br> I say with Gandhiji:<br> There is no beauty<br> in the finest cloth...<br> ...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.<br> My message to you...<br> ...is the message I have given<br> to your brothers everywhere.<br> To gain independence...<br> ...we must prove worthy of it.<br> There must be<br> Hindu-Muslim unity always.<br> Second:<br> No Indian must be treated<br> as the English treat us.<br> We must remove untouchability...<br> ...from our hearts and from our lives.<br> Third:<br> We must defy the British.<br> Not with violence<br> that will inflame their will...<br> ...but with a firmness that will<br> open their eyes.<br> English factories make the cloth...<br> ...that makes our poverty.<br> All those who wish to<br> make the English see...<br> ...bring me the cloth from Manchester<br> and Leeds that you wear today...<br> ...and we will light a fire<br> that will be seen in Delhi...<br> ...and in London.<br> And if...<br> ...like me...<br> ...you are left with only<br> one piece of homespun...<br> ...wear it with dignity.<br> Thank you very much.<br> No, thank you, I can manage.<br> Don't destroy my good intentions.<br> I'm already feeling guilty<br> about travelling second class.<br> You've earned a few indulgences.<br> Perhaps, but Maulana's made<br> of sterner stuff.<br> Our trains met in Bombay.<br> And there he is, back in<br> that lot, the model disciple.<br> There's another passenger.<br> A Miss Slade from London. She's<br> been writing to Gandhiji for years.<br> She's the daughter<br> of an English admiral.<br> What do you think the daughter<br> of an English admiral...<br> ...proposes to do in our ashram?<br> - Sink us?<br> - From the looks of the luggage, yes.<br> She wants to make her home with us.<br> And Gandhiji has agreed.<br> Miss Slade!<br> You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.<br> And you would be Miss Slade?<br> I prefer the name<br> Gandhiji has given me:<br> Mirabehn.<br> Don't pull it so fast.<br> You'll break it again.<br> Leave it. Leave it.<br> God gave you 1 0 thumbs.<br> Eleven.<br> Sardar!<br> Mirabehn!<br> Come, come.<br> You will be my daughter.<br> But then...<br> ...some rioting broke out...<br> ...between Hindus and Muslims.<br> Violent, terrible.<br> Whether it was provoked...<br> ...I don't know.<br> But it gave them an excuse to impose<br> martial law throughout Bengal.<br> Some of the things<br> the military have done...<br> Is the campaign weakening?<br> The marches and protests are bigger,<br> if anything.<br> But with the censorship here...<br> ...they know more in England...<br> ...than we do.<br> It saps the courage to think you<br> may be suffering alone.<br> They are not alone.<br> And martial law only shows<br> how desperate the British are.<br> Is that homespun?<br> I sent for it from here.<br> I dyed it myself.<br> What do the workers in England<br> make of what we're doing?<br> It must have produced hardship.<br> It has...<br> ...but you'd be surprised.<br> They do understand.<br> Good.<br> Ba will have to teach you<br> to spin too.<br> - I'd rather march.<br> - First, spin!<br> Let the others march for a time.<br> I'll teach you all our foolishness.<br> And you must teach me yours.<br> We burn British cloth!<br> We burn British cloth!<br> Long live Gandhiji!<br> Long live Gandhiji!<br> British rule must go!<br> British rule must go!<br> I'll stuff it down your damn throat!<br> Help us!<br> Leave us alone!<br> We're not harming you.<br> Go on your way. On your way!<br> Come back!<br> Help us! Help us!<br> Help! Help!<br> That's one bit of news<br> they haven't censored.<br> Now it's all over the world.<br> India's "nonviolence."<br> What can we do?<br> We must end the campaign.<br> After what they did at the massacre?<br> It's only an eye for an eye.<br> An eye for an eye only ends up<br> making the whole world blind.<br> Do you know the sacrifices<br> people have made?<br> We'd never get the same<br> commitment again, ever.<br> The whole of India is on the move!<br> Yes, but in what direction?<br> If we obtain our freedom by murder and<br> bloodshed, I want no part of it.<br> You are the father of the nation.<br> Today, I see no ground in that<br> for anything but shame.<br> This was one incident.<br> Tell that to the families of<br> the policemen who died.<br> The whole nation is marching.<br> They wouldn't stop,<br> even if we asked them to.<br> I will ask.<br> And I will fast as a penance<br> for my part in arousing such emotions.<br> And I will not stop until they stop.<br> But...<br> God! You can be sure<br> the British won't censor that.<br> They'll put it on every street corner.<br> People are aroused.<br> They won't stop!<br> If I die, perhaps they will stop.<br> I must get ready for morning prayers.<br> Mirabehn is here.<br> I've brought your drinking water.<br> There's a little lemon juice in it.<br> That's all.<br> Herman has gone to meet Pandit Nehru.<br> There was a telegram.<br> Almost everywhere, it has stopped.<br> When it is everywhere...<br> ...then my prayers will be answered.<br> Do you find me stubborn?<br> I don't know.<br> I know that you are right.<br> I don't know that this is right.<br> May I turn you?<br> When I despair...<br> ...I remember that<br> all through history...<br> ...the way of truth and love<br> has always won.<br> There have been tyrants<br> and murderers...<br> ...and, for a time,<br> they can seem invincible.<br> But in the end, they always fall.<br> Think of it.<br> Always.<br> Whenever you are in doubt that<br> that is God's way...<br> ...the way the world is meant to be...<br> ...think of that...<br> ...and then try to do it His way.<br> And now, could I have<br> another feast of lemon juice?<br> Panditji!<br> Jinnah...<br> ...Patel...<br> ...all of congress has called<br> for the end of noncooperation.<br> There's not been one demonstration.<br> All over India, people are praying<br> that you will end the fast.<br> They're walking in the streets...<br> ...offering garlands to the police...<br> ...and British soldiers.<br> Perhaps I have overdone it.<br> - Good morning, Bapu.<br> - Good morning.<br> Don't let him go.<br> If he bumps me, I'm done for.<br> Don't worry, I won't let him go.<br> I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...<br> ...but you're under arrest.<br> On what charge?<br> Sedition.<br> You can't be serious.<br> This man has just stopped<br> a revolution.<br> That's as may be.<br> I only know what<br> I am charged to perform.<br> I don't believe it!<br> Even the British can't be that stupid.<br> Help me, please.<br> Mira, you must look after Ba.<br> If there is one protest, one riot,<br> a disgrace of any kind...<br> ...I will fast again.<br> Herman.<br> I have been on many trips.<br> Monda.<br> This is just another trip.<br> I am at your command.<br> I know we are not ready<br> for my kind of independence.<br> If I'm sent to jail,<br> perhaps that is the best protest...<br> ...our country can make at this time.<br> And if it helps India, I've never<br> refused His Majesty's hospitality.<br> Call the prisoner to the bar.<br> "Noncooperation has one aim:<br> The overthrow of the government.<br> Sedition must become our creed.<br> We must give no quarter...<br> ...nor can we expect any."<br> - Do you deny writing it?<br> - Not at all.<br> And I will save the court's time...<br> ...my lord, by stating<br> under oath that, to this day...<br> ...I believe noncooperation<br> with evil is a duty...<br> ...and that British rule<br> of India is evil.<br> The prosecution rests, my lord.<br> I presume you are conducting<br> your own defence.<br> I have no defence, my lord.<br> I am guilty as charged.<br> And if you truly believe<br> in your system of law...<br> ...you must inflict on me<br> the severest penalty possible.<br> It is impossible for me to ignore<br> that you're in a different category...<br> ...from any person<br> I have ever tried...<br> ...or am likely to try.<br> Nevertheless, it is my duty<br> to sentence you...<br> ...to six years' imprisonment.<br> lf, however, His Majesty's government<br> should, at some later date...<br> ...see fit to reduce the term...<br> ...no one will be<br> better pleased than I.<br> Yes, I'm sure that's exactly<br> what they hoped:<br> Put him in prison a few years.<br> With luck, he'd be forgotten.<br> Maybe they could even subdue him.<br> Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.<br> And as soon as he got out,<br> he was back, tramping the countryside...<br> ...preaching nonviolence and<br> demanding a free India.<br> Everyone knows<br> another showdown's coming.<br> How does an American journalist<br> in Central America...<br> ...learn that Gandhi was born<br> in Porbandar anyway?<br> I've been aware of him<br> for a long time.<br> He certainly makes good copy.<br> The other day, Winston Churchill<br> called him a half-naked Indian fakir.<br> I met him once.<br> - What, you mean Gandhi?<br> - Yeah.<br> South Africa, a long time ago.<br> I wonder if he'll recognize me.<br> What was he like?<br> He had a full head of hair then.<br> We were a bit like college students,<br> trying to figure everything out.<br> Well, he must have found<br> some of the answers.<br> In every worthy wish of yours,<br> I shall be your helpmate.<br> Helpmate.<br> Take the fourth step,<br> that we may be ever full of joy.<br> I will ever live devoted to you...<br> ...speaking words of love<br> and praying for your happiness.<br> Take the fifth step...<br> ...the walking around a fire...<br> ...that we may serve the people.<br> I will follow close behind you...<br> ...and help to serve the people.<br> Take the sixth step...<br> ...that we may follow<br> our vows in life.<br> I will follow you<br> in all our vows and duties.<br> Take the seventh step...<br> ...that we may ever<br> live as friends.<br> You are my best friend...<br> ...my highest guru...<br> ...and my sovereign lord.<br> And then I put a sweetened<br> wheat cake in her mouth.<br> And I put a sweetened<br> wheat cake in his mouth.<br> And with that, we were pronounced...<br> ...man and wife.<br> We were both 1 3.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Even as a boy...<br> ...I thought so.<br> Thank you.<br> Trying to keep up with you<br> is like chasing a jackrabbit.<br> You've come because you think<br> something is going to happen.<br> Is it?<br> Perhaps.<br> I've come here to think about it.<br> Do you remember much<br> of South Africa?<br> Oh, yes. A great deal.<br> I've travelled so far...<br> ...and thought so much.<br> As you can see,<br> my city is a sea city.<br> Always full of Hindus...<br> ...Muslims...<br> ...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.<br> My family's sect was the Pranami.<br> Hindu, of course.<br> But in our temple,<br> the priest used to read...<br> ...from the Muslim Koran...<br> ...and the Hindu Gita,<br> moving from one to the other...<br> ...as if it mattered not<br> which book was read...<br> ...as long as God was worshipped.<br> When I was a boy...<br> ...I used to sing a song<br> in the temple.<br> A true disciple<br> Knows another's woes<br> As his own<br> He bows to all...<br> ...and despises none.<br> Like all other boys...<br> ...I sang the words...<br> ...not thinking what they meant<br> or how they might influence me.<br> I've travelled so far.<br> And all I've done is come back...<br> ...home.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You know what you're going to do,<br> don't you?<br> It would have been uncivil of me...<br> ...to let you make<br> such a long trip for nothing.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Come.<br> - Where are we going?<br> - Back to the ashram.<br> Then to prove to the new viceroy...<br> ...that the king's writ<br> no longer runs in India.<br> Salt?<br> Yes, sir. He's going to march<br> to the sea and make salt.<br> There's a royal monopoly<br> on the manufacture of salt.<br> It's illegal to make it or sell it<br> without a government license.<br> All right, he's breaking the law.<br> What will that deprive us of?<br> Two rupees of salt tax?<br> It's not a serious attack<br> on the revenue.<br> Its primary importance is symbolic.<br> Don't patronize me, Charles.<br> In this climate, nothing lives<br> without water or salt.<br> Our absolute control of it is<br> a control on the pulse of India.<br> And that's the basis of<br> this declaration of independence?<br> The day he sets off...<br> ...everyone is supposed to<br> raise the flag of "Free India."<br> And then he walks some 240 miles<br> to the sea and makes salt.<br> I say ignore it.<br> Let them raise their damned flags.<br> Let him make his salt.<br> It's only symbolic<br> if we choose to make it so.<br> He'll arrive at the sea...<br> ...on the anniversary<br> of the Massacre of Amritsar.<br> General Edgar is right.<br> Ignore it.<br> Mr. Gandhi will find<br> it takes a great deal more...<br> ...than a pinch of salt<br> to bring down the British Empire.<br> You've done me a great service.<br> Not at all, sir.<br> It would be uncivil of us to let you<br> make such a long trip for nothing.<br> We'll go.<br> Long live Gandhiji!<br> Long live Gandhiji!<br> Is it over if they arrest you now?<br> Not if they arrest me...<br> ...or 1 000 or 1 0,000.<br> It's not only generals<br> who know how to plan campaigns.<br> What if they don't arrest you?<br> What if they don't react at all?<br> Something for your notebook:<br> The function of a civil resister<br> is to provoke response.<br> And we will continue to provoke...<br> ...until they respond<br> or they change the law.<br> They are not in control.<br> We are.<br> That is the strength<br> of civil resistance.<br> Vince!<br> - What did he say?<br> - He said he's in control.<br> Do you intend to walk all the way?<br> It's the only way<br> I can get the story.<br> Besides, my name is Walker.<br> "My name is Walker."<br> My dear Mrs. Nehru!<br> Man needs salt...<br> ...as he needs air and water.<br> This salt comes<br> from the Indian Ocean.<br> Let every Indian claim it<br> as his right.<br> And so, once more,<br> the man of nonviolence...<br> ... has challenged the might<br> of the British Empire.<br> They're making it everywhere, sir.<br> Mobs of them.<br> Publicly.<br> Congress leaders are selling it<br> on the streets of Delhi.<br> We're being made fools of, sir...<br> ...around the world.<br> Isn't there any instruction<br> from London?<br> We're required to stop it.<br> And stop it we will!<br> I don't care if we fill the jails.<br> Stop it!<br> Arrest anyone, any rank,<br> except Gandhi.<br> We'll cut the strength<br> from under him.<br> And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.<br> Jump to it!<br> Clear this beach!<br> Don't hit back!<br> No violence!<br> There must be 1 00,000 under arrest.<br> And it still goes on.<br> - Who's leading them?<br> - I don't know. Nehru, Patel...<br> ...most congress officials are in jail.<br> And their wives and children.<br> We've even arrested Nehru's mother.<br> Has there been any violence?<br> In Peshawar,<br> the deputy police commissioner...<br> ...lost his head and opened fire<br> with a machine gun.<br> But he's facing disciplinary court.<br> You can't expect things<br> like that not to happen.<br> The question was intended to discover<br> if there was any violence on their side.<br> No, sir.<br> I'm afraid not.<br> Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,<br> it might...<br> He's addressed this letter<br> directly to you, has he?<br> Yes, sir, he has.<br> The usual thing:<br> "India's salt belongs to India."<br> Then he says flatly...<br> ...that he will lead a raid tomorrow<br> on the Dharasana Salt Works.<br> Thank him for his letter...<br> ...and put him in jail.<br> Yes, sir.<br> It'll be my pleasure.<br> - And Fields?<br> - Sir?<br> Keep that salt works open.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> My orders are to allow regular staff<br> only through these gates.<br> Very well.<br> ...in his name.<br> And for his sake,<br> we will not raise a hand.<br> Long live Mahatma Gandhi!<br> Long live Gandhiji!<br> We are ready!<br> I want firmness and discipline.<br> - All right, take up your positions.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> To your mark. Forward!<br> Last night at midnight...<br> ...they took Gandhiji from us.<br> They expect us to lose heart...<br> ...or to fight back.<br> We will do neither!<br> On your guard!<br> No, sir.<br> The gate is closed!<br> "They walked...<br> ... both Hindu and Muslim alike...<br> ... with heads held high...<br> ... without any hope of escape...<br> ... from injury or death.<br> It went on and on into the night."<br> Stop.<br> "Women carried the wounded<br> and broken bodies from the road...<br> ...until they dropped<br> from exhaustion."<br> Stop.<br> "But still, it went on and on.<br> Whatever moral ascendancy<br> the West held...<br> ...was lost here today.<br> India is free...<br> ... for she has taken all<br> that steel and cruelty can give...<br> ... and she has neither<br> cringed nor retreated. "<br> I am aware that I must have given<br> you much cause for irritation...<br> ...Your Excellency.<br> I hope it will not stand<br> between us as men.<br> Mr. Gandhi...<br> ...I am instructed to request<br> your attendance...<br> ...at an all-government<br> conference in London...<br> ...to discuss the possible<br> independence...<br> ...of India.<br> Only recently released from prison...<br> ... Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay<br> on the SS Rajputana...<br> ... to attend the conference<br> on Indian independence...<br> ... called by Prime Minister<br> Ramsay MacDonald.<br> Mr. Gandhi, the sole<br> Indian Congress Party delegate...<br> ... is staying at Kingsley Hall<br> in London's East End...<br> ... for the duration of the talks.<br> He's seen here<br> amongst local cockneys...<br> ... who have taken him<br> to their hearts.<br> Besides attending the conference...<br> ... he has found time to meet<br> political and religious leaders...<br> ... like Mr. Lloyd George...<br> ... the Archbishop of Canterbury,<br> George Bernard Shaw...<br> ... and Charlie Chaplin.<br> He journeyed last week<br> from Kingsley Hall...<br> ... to accept an invitation to tea<br> from King George and Queen Mary...<br> ... at Buckingham Palace<br> before attending the conference.<br> And I would emphasize<br> that I think our first duty...<br> ...is to recognize<br> that there is not one India...<br> ...but several.<br> A Hindu India...<br> ...a Muslim India...<br> ...and an India of princely states.<br> And all these must be respected...<br> ...and cared for.<br> Not just one.<br> Mr. Gandhi, who has been attending...<br> ... the London Round Table Conference<br> on Indian Independence...<br> ... journeyed north<br> to visit a cotton mill.<br> Although not dressed<br> for the Lancashire climate...<br> ... Mr. Gandhi received<br> a warm welcome from mill workers...<br> ... before heading back south...<br> ... for a final meeting<br> with Mr. MacDonald.<br> The prime minister said the talks<br> were both constructive and frank.<br> So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.<br> And bon voyage!<br> So the truth is,<br> after all your travels...<br> ... after all your efforts...<br> ...they've stopped the campaign<br> and sent you back empty-handed.<br> They're only clinging<br> to old dreams...<br> ...and trying to split us<br> in the old way.<br> But the will has gone.<br> Independence will fall<br> like a ripe apple.<br> The only question is, when and how.<br> Well, I say, when is now!<br> And we will determine how.<br> Precisely.<br> Bapu, she is limping again.<br> It's only a sprain.<br> Take her to the river.<br> We'll make a mud pack for her.<br> Go. I won't be a moment.<br> They are preparing for war.<br> I will not support it.<br> But I do not intend to take<br> advantage of their danger.<br> That's when you take advantage.<br> That is just another way<br> of hitting back.<br> We've come a long way together<br> with the British.<br> When they leave, we want to<br> see them off as friends.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me,<br> there is something I must attend to.<br> Mud packs.<br> Mr. Gandhi, sir.<br> I've been instructed to inquire as to<br> the subject of your speech tonight.<br> The value of goat's milk<br> in daily diet.<br> But you can be sure that<br> I will also speak against war.<br> Sorry, that can't be permitted.<br> Corporal!<br> It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.<br> I have orders to return with you<br> and your companion to the ashram.<br> If you take my husband,<br> I intend to speak in his place.<br> Hold it a second, will you?<br> It was the Aga Khan's palace<br> before they turned it into a prison.<br> They're holding Gandhi<br> and congress politicians there.<br> Pandit Nehru and the others<br> are up at Ahmednagar Fort.<br> Not bad for a prison, eh?<br> I guess no place is good<br> if you're locked in.<br> Your timing's pretty lucky.<br> They had him cut off from the press.<br> But his personal secretary died,<br> so they let up on restrictions.<br> Yes, I have heard of Life magazine.<br> I've even heard of<br> Margaret Bourke-White.<br> But I don't know why either<br> should be interested in an old man...<br> ...sitting alone in prison...<br> ...while the rest of the world<br> is blowing itself to pieces.<br> Well, you're the only man I know<br> who makes his own clothes.<br> But for me, that's not<br> much of an accomplishment.<br> No, prison is rather agreeable to me.<br> And there is no doubt that<br> after the war...<br> ...independence will come.<br> My only worry...<br> ...is what shape it will take.<br> - Jinnah has...<br> - Stop!<br> I'm sorry, but...<br> Could you come forward, please?<br> - Come, come.<br> - Just up to the railing.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Now, sorry.<br> Go on. "What shape it will take..."<br> Jinnah has what?<br> Jinnah has cooperated with the British.<br> It has given him power<br> and the freedom to speak.<br> And he's filled<br> the Muslims with fears...<br> ...of what will happen to them...<br> ...in a country that<br> is predominantly Hindu.<br> And that I find hard to bear...<br> ...even in prison.<br> Mr. Gandhi?<br> It's hard for me to see this as a<br> cure for the 20th century's problems.<br> I have friends who keep telling me...<br> ...how much it costs them<br> to keep me in poverty.<br> But I know happiness<br> does not come with things...<br> ...even 20th century things.<br> It can come from work<br> and pride in what you do.<br> India lives in her villages...<br> ...and the terrible poverty there<br> can only be removed...<br> ...if their local skills<br> can be revived.<br> Poverty is the worst form<br> of violence.<br> And a constructive program<br> is the only...<br> ...nonviolent solution<br> to India's agony.<br> It will not necessarily be<br> progress for India...<br> ...if she simply imports<br> the unhappiness of the West.<br> Do you really believe you could<br> use nonviolence against Hitler?<br> Not without defeats and great pain.<br> But are there no defeats in this war?<br> No pain?<br> What you cannot do...<br> ...is accept injustice<br> from Hitler or anyone.<br> You must make the injustice visible.<br> Be prepared to die<br> like a soldier to do so.<br> Is this what I'm meant to<br> end up with here?<br> That's what you get<br> for distracting me.<br> What do you expect<br> when you talk like that?<br> I expect you to show<br> as much patience as I am now.<br> Turn slowly and pull it gently.<br> And that includes the life of women.<br> Bapu has always said...<br> ...there were two kinds<br> of slavery in India:<br> One for women,<br> one for the untouchables.<br> And he has always fought against both.<br> Does it rankle,<br> being separated in this way?<br> In Hindu philosophy...<br> ...the way to God...<br> ...is to free yourself<br> of possessions...<br> ...and of passions.<br> Bapu has always struggled<br> to find the way to God.<br> Do you mean that<br> he gave up married life?<br> Four times he tried...<br> ...and failed.<br> But then he took a solemn vow.<br> And he's never broken it?<br> Not yet.<br> - I've got permission to move her.<br> - I'm very sorry, sir.<br> She's had a massive thrombosis.<br> It's a serious heart attack.<br> She'll never survive the trip.<br> It's better if we just<br> keep her here and hope.<br> It's time for my walk.<br> I won't be long.<br> Guard...<br> ...present arms!<br> We have come to crown victory<br> with friendship.<br> To assist at the birth of<br> an independent India...<br> ...and to welcome her<br> as an equal member...<br> ...in the British Commonwealth<br> of Nations.<br> I am here to see that I am<br> the last British viceroy...<br> ...ever to have the honour<br> of such a reception.<br> I am not concerned about<br> the independence of India.<br> I'm concerned about<br> the slavery of Muslims.<br> Please, Mr. Jinnah.<br> I won't watch the mastery<br> of the British...<br> ...replaced by<br> the mastery of the Hindus.<br> Muslim and Hindu are the right<br> and left eye of India.<br> No one will be master, no one slave.<br> The world is not made of<br> Mahatma Ghandis.<br> I'm talking about the real world.<br> - How the...<br> - The real India has...<br> ...Muslims and Hindus<br> in every village and every city.<br> How will you separate them?<br> Where there is a Muslim majority...<br> ...that will be Pakistan.<br> The rest is your India.<br> My dear Jinnah...<br> ...the Muslims are in a majority<br> on two different sides of the country.<br> Let us worry about Pakistan.<br> You worry about India.<br> Gentlemen...<br> ...I think perhaps<br> we should recommence.<br> Death to Jinnah!<br> Death to Jinnah!<br> Thank God, they've stopped.<br> Manu. Abha.<br> I'm your granduncle...<br> ...but I can still walk<br> either of you into the ground.<br> I don't need to be pampered<br> in this way.<br> Finish your quota of spinning.<br> Bapu, please don't do it.<br> What do you want me not to do?<br> Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?<br> I am a Muslim...<br> ...and a Hindu...<br> ...and a Christian and a Jew.<br> And so are all of you.<br> When you wave those flags and shout...<br> ...you send fear into the hearts<br> of your brothers.<br> That is not the India I want.<br> Stop it!<br> For God's sake, stop it.<br> If you've finished your prayers...<br> ...perhaps we could begin<br> our business.<br> My dear Jinnah...<br> ...you and I are brothers...<br> ...born of the same mother India.<br> If you have fears...<br> ...I want to put them at rest.<br> Begging the understanding<br> of my friends...<br> ...I am asking Panditji<br> to stand down.<br> I want you to be<br> the first prime minister of India...<br> ...to name your entire cabinet...<br> ...to make the head of every<br> government department a Muslim.<br> For me and the rest...<br> ...if that is what you want...<br> ...we will accept it.<br> But out there...<br> ...already there is rioting...<br> ...because Hindus fear you are<br> going to give too much away.<br> If you did this...<br> ...no one would control it.<br> No one.<br> It is your choice.<br> Do you want an independent India<br> and an independent Pakistan...<br> ...or do you want civil war?<br> Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!<br> What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,<br> was a miracle.<br> Miracle.<br> But millions are on the move...<br> ...and no one can count the dead.<br> In Calcutta, it's like civil war.<br> The Muslims rose<br> and there was a bloodbath.<br> Now the Hindus are taking revenge.<br> If we can't stop it...<br> ...there'll be no hope<br> for the Hindus left in Pakistan.<br> An eye for an eye,<br> making the whole world blind.<br> Aren't there any troops to spare?<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> The divisions in Bombay and Delhi<br> can hardly keep the peace now.<br> And each fresh bit of news creates<br> another wave of madness.<br> We could cut all news off.<br> Bapu, please, where are you going?<br> I don't want to hear more.<br> We need your help.<br> There is nothing I can give.<br> Where are you going?<br> Calcutta.<br> If I had shunned death or feared it,<br> I would not be here now...<br> ...nor would you be concerned for me.<br> But, sir, please.<br> I don't have the men to protect you...<br> ...not in a Muslim house,<br> not this quarter.<br> I'm staying with the friend<br> of a friend and...<br> Death to Muslims!<br> Death to Muslims!<br> Why are you staying<br> at the home of a Muslim?<br> They are murderers!<br> They killed my family!<br> Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!<br> Death to Muslims!<br> Death to Muslims!<br> Prime Minister.<br> Why must I read news<br> like this in the paper?<br> Inform Sardar Patel.<br> Arrange a plane.<br> We will go Friday.<br> Four days, sir?<br> Sardar, you have gained weight.<br> You must join me in the fast.<br> If I fast, I die.<br> If you fast, people go to<br> all sorts of trouble...<br> ...to keep you alive.<br> Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.<br> I could have come earlier...<br> ...but your fast has helped.<br> These last days, people's minds<br> have begun to turn to this bed...<br> ...and away from the atrocities.<br> But now...<br> ...it is enough.<br> All that has happened is that<br> I've grown a little thinner.<br> Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...<br> ...of all ages...<br> ...are marching here,<br> in Calcutta, for peace.<br> And 5000 Hindu students<br> are marching with them.<br> I'm glad.<br> But it will not be enough.<br> You are not so young anymore.<br> Don't worry for me.<br> I cannot watch the destruction<br> of all that I've lived for.<br> Death to Gandhi!<br> Who dares say such things?!<br> Who?!<br> You kill me first!<br> Come!<br> Where are you?!<br> Kill me first!<br> Where are you?<br> His pulse is very irregular.<br> The kidneys aren't functioning.<br> I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.<br> It was he who called<br> on the Muslims to rise.<br> He is now telling them...<br> ...to go back to their homes...<br> ...to lay down their arms.<br> Think what you can do by living...<br> ...that you cannot do by dying.<br> What do you want?<br> That the fighting will stop.<br> That you make me believe...<br> ...that it will never start again.<br> Sometimes...<br> ...it is when you are<br> quite without hope...<br> ...and in utter darkness...<br> ...that God comes to the rescue.<br> Gandhiji...<br> ...is dying...<br> ...because of our madness.<br> Put away your revenge.<br> What good will come of more killing?<br> Have the courage to do...<br> ...what you know is right.<br> For God's sake...<br> ...let us embrace like brothers.<br> It's our promise.<br> We stop.<br> Hindu swords.<br> It's a promise.<br> Go.<br> God be with you.<br> Here, eat!<br> Eat!<br> I'm going to hell...<br> ...but not with your death on my soul.<br> Only God decides who goes to hell.<br> I killed a child.<br> I smashed his head against a wall.<br> Why?<br> They killed my son.<br> My boy.<br> The Muslims killed my son!<br> I know a way out of hell.<br> Find a child.<br> A child whose mother and father<br> have been killed.<br> A little boy about this high...<br> ...and raise him as your own.<br> Only be sure that he is a Muslim...<br> ...and that you raise him as one.<br> Go.<br> Go.<br> God bless you.<br> Bapu?<br> There's been no fighting...<br> ...anywhere.<br> It's stopped.<br> The madness has stopped.<br> It's foolish...<br> ...if it's just to save<br> the life of an old man.<br> No. In every temple and mosque...<br> ...they have pledged to die...<br> ...before they lift a hand<br> against each other.<br> It is true, Bapu.<br> Everywhere.<br> Maulana, my friend...<br> ...could I have some orange juice?<br> Then you and I...<br> ...will take a piece<br> of bread together.<br> He will be saying prayers<br> in the garden.<br> That is how you eat muli.<br> I'm not sure that I want<br> to be remembered that way.<br> Don't worry.<br> With luck, you may not be.<br> No, he will be remembered<br> for tempting fate.<br> Mickey Mouse!<br> You're really going to Pakistan?<br> You are a stubborn man.<br> I'm simply going to prove...<br> ...to Hindus here and Muslims there...<br> ...that the only devils<br> in the world are those...<br> ...running around in our own hearts.<br> And that is where all our battles<br> ought to be fought.<br> So, what kind of warrior have you<br> been in that warfare?<br> Not a very good one.<br> That's why I have<br> so much tolerance...<br> ...for the other scoundrels<br> of the world.<br> Sardar?<br> Ask Panditji to consider<br> what we've discussed.<br> - Enough!<br> - One more.<br> - You're a temptress!<br> - Just an admirer.<br> Nothing's more dangerous...<br> ...especially for an old man.<br> There's a sadness about him.<br> He thinks he's failed.<br> Why?<br> If anything's proven him right,<br> it's these last months.<br> I may be blinded by my love for him...<br> ...but I believe...<br> ...when we most needed it...<br> ...he offered the world<br> a way out of madness.<br> But he doesn't see it.<br> Neither does the world.<br> Brother, Bapu is already<br> late for prayers.<br> Oh, God!<br> Oh, God.<br> When I despair...<br> ... I remember...<br> ... that all through history...<br> ... the way of truth and love<br> has always won.<br> There have been tyrants<br> and murderers...<br> ... and for a time,<br> they can seem invincible...<br> ... but in the end, they always fall.<br> Think of it.<br> Always.<br> GelulalSDI<br>
