I ain't gonna bite. Close.<br> There's a Portuguese ship lying low<br> in the harbor, quarantined three weeks.<br> Get there before<br> the Daybreak Boys strip her...<br> ...maybe you and me will talk more.<br> - Consider it done, sir.<br> - Good boy.<br> And you, whatever your name is...<br> What is your name?<br> - Amsterdam, sir.<br> - Amsterdam. I'm New York.<br> Don't you never come in here<br> empty-handed again.<br> You gotta pay for the pleasure<br> of my company.<br> Take him for a boat ride, John.<br> Who knows, but he might<br> save your life again.<br> The Daybreak Boys catch us,<br> they'll slit our throats.<br> I'll do it myself in a minute<br> if you don't keep quiet.<br> I never liked the harbor after dark.<br> And now each night they brung ashore<br> the bodies of the soldiers.<br> Many mothers have not<br> even the solace...<br> ...of knowing where<br> their sons have fallen.<br> I lost my own eldest at Antietam.<br> His mother and I were unable<br> to recover his remains.<br> - It was a mournful sight.<br> - The war can't last forever.<br> But we had business of our own.<br> The Daybreak Boys have been here,<br> and there's nothing left. Let's go back.<br> What the hell?<br> Jimmy, get down!<br> Jesus, that'll bring the harbor cops<br> for sure. Fuck off.<br> Let's take a look.<br> Jesus, they killed everybody.<br> There's nothing here but a bunch<br> of dead sea-crabs.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> - Shove off.<br> - No, wait for Amsterdam.<br> Where's Amsterdam?<br> - No, you damn fool, take him!<br> - What in the hell for?!<br> Look in my glims.<br> I said no less than 15.<br> - Is this fresh?<br> - Four hours most.<br> Much obliged, gents.<br> What's that word?<br> - It means body snatchers.<br> - I didn't ask the meaning.<br> I asked the word.<br> Ghoul.<br> Ghoul? That's a good word.<br> "Ghoul Gang Slaughters.<br> A fresh Outrage in the Five Points."<br> - That's a notice you can be proud of.<br> - Thank you.<br> A low thing, to do that to a body.<br> Low.<br> Why? They could have left<br> that ship with nothing.<br> Instead they made The Police Gazette,<br> a periodical of note.<br> A body's supposed to stay<br> beneath the earth...<br> ...wearing a wooden coat<br> until the Resurrection.<br> These two are a pair of sons<br> of Irish bitches, same as you.<br> It don't seem to bother them none.<br> But then maybe they don't share<br> your religious scruples.<br> Maybe they're just a couple<br> of fidlam Bens.<br> I've been called a lot of things, mister,<br> but I ain't never been called...<br> - fidlam Bens.<br> - Fidlam Bens. Right.<br> Well, if I knew what in the hell that<br> meant, I'd be inclined to take offense.<br> A fidlam Bens is a fellow<br> who steals anything, dead or alive...<br> ...because he's too low to work up<br> a decent lay for himself.<br> Count that careful, Bill.<br> Count that careful.<br> - I'm telling you, that's all there is...<br> - Now, chiseler...<br> If you'd said "chiseler," now there's<br> a word I understand. You know?<br> - Now, is that what you're calling us?<br> - I can think of many things to call you.<br> Right. But I asked<br> if you was calling us chiselers.<br> Supposing I am?<br> Well, then we got business.<br> That we do.<br> - A fight! There's a fight!<br> - Two bucks on McGloin.<br> - Four bits on the kid.<br> - Five bits on the kid.<br> I got two on Amsterdam.<br> Come on, McGloin, he's just a kid.<br> Four bits to back Amsterdam.<br> Watch his left, McGloin. Watch his left.<br> - All right, that'll do. That'll do.<br> - Anything to say now, huh?!<br> That'll do, for chrissake.<br> Drag him off.<br> - That's enough, kid.<br> - You got him. Come on, kid, you won.<br> McGloin. He's a kid too, McGloin.<br> You're getting too old for it, McGloin.<br> McGloin, how would that head look<br> without the ears and the nose on it?<br> You'd better leave<br> that head alone, Bill.<br> I think I'm gonna trim the ears<br> and the beak off of that head.<br> Make a nice pot of soup of that head.<br> You could find a tastier head<br> than that, Bill.<br> I ain't got the stomach for no Irish stew.<br> The mighty McGloin<br> almost fishhooked by a sprat.<br> On the seventh day, the Lord rested,<br> but before that he did...<br> ...he squatted over the side of England,<br> and what came out of him was Ireland.<br> - No offense, son.<br> - Oh, none taken, sir. I grew up here.<br> All I ever knew of Ireland was in the<br> talk of the others at the orphan asylum.<br> In which part of that excrementitious<br> isle were your forebears spawned?<br> I've been told Kerry, but I lost proof<br> of it in my language at the asylum.<br> I was raised in a very similar<br> establishment myself.<br> Now everything you see belongs to me,<br> to one degree or another.<br> The beggars and newsboys<br> and quick thieves here in Paradise.<br> The sailor dives and gin mills<br> and blind tigers on the waterfront.<br> The anglers and amusers,<br> the she-hes and the Chinks.<br> Everybody owes, everybody pays...<br> ...because that's how you stand up<br> against the rising of the tide.<br> - Is that right, boys?<br> - Yeah, Bill. That's right.<br> Enlist. Join up. Serve your country.<br> Come on in out of the draft, boys.<br> Volunteer and get your $50 bonus.<br> We need 30,000 volunteers, and we're<br> prepared to pay $677 per volunteer.<br> - Please read this. Thank you.<br> - Thanks.<br> Would you like to take<br> one of these to fill out?<br> Three square meals a day.<br> Three square meals a day.<br> Young man, enlist<br> and serve your country.<br> Three square meals a day, gentlemen.<br> If you're interested,<br> read this and consider joining.<br> Everywhere you went<br> people talked about the draft.<br> Now, you could buy<br> your way out for $300...<br> ...but who had $300?<br> For us it might as well<br> have been 3 million.<br> The recruiters? They was too scared<br> of the gangs to come after us.<br> Besides, we never dreamt the war<br> would ever touch New York.<br> Good morning, sir.<br> You!<br> Don't you run into me.<br> Fair enough.<br> I said, don't run into me!<br> Well, sorry.<br> - Everything in place?<br> - It seems so.<br> Well, then I leave you<br> in the grace and favor of the Lord.<br> - Thank you.<br> - That's right.<br> Oh, the dirty mab!<br> Oh, no.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Allow me.<br> - Thank you kindly, sir.<br> - Oh, it's my pleasure.<br> I hope you won't think<br> me rude if I speak.<br> I wouldn't want to appear forward.<br> Well, sir, that depends<br> on what you say.<br> Would you call me reckless if I said<br> you were the prettiest girl in New York?<br> Only New York?<br> This is my stop.<br> May I walk with you a little then?<br> That, sir, would be too bold.<br> Good morning.<br> For every lay we had a different name.<br> An "angler" put a hook<br> on the end of a stick...<br> ...to drop behind<br> store windows and doors.<br> An "autumn diver"<br> picked your pocket in church.<br> A "badger" gets a fellow<br> into bed with a girl...<br> ...then robs his pockets<br> while they're on the go.<br> Jenny was a "bludget,"<br> a girl pickpocket...<br> ...and a "turtledove."<br> A turtledove goes uptown<br> dressed like a housemaid...<br> ...picks out a fine house<br> and goes right through the back door.<br> Robs you blind.<br> It takes a lot of sand<br> to be a turtledove.<br> I'll have my medal back. Oh, Jesus!<br> Don't do that again.<br> Listen! I said, don't do that...<br> Go back to the Points<br> and leave me to my business...<br> ...or I will open your throat,<br> so help me God.<br> All right.<br> Go on then.<br> I would.<br> Go on then.<br> Now give me back my medal.<br> Make it quick!<br> I don't know which one's yours.<br> Suppose I help myself to everything?<br> Suppose you do.<br> May I walk with you a little then?<br> What do you suppose a fellow<br> could earn here in a day?<br> - Maybe we could pal in together.<br> - Oh, I think you're a bit...<br> ...rough for this sort of game.<br> Besides, I work alone.<br> Alone? Well, what do you quarter<br> to the Butcher?<br> - Me? Nothing.<br> - Nothing?<br> The Butcher and me<br> have a special arrangement.<br> - I don't want to see you again.<br> - Well, I don't blame you.<br> Pennies in their pockets<br> and hope in their eyes...<br> ...they peer to the west...<br> ...searching the horizon<br> for a glimpse of land and salvation.<br> A glimpse of America.<br> Seeing all this poverty must be<br> most unsettling, Miss Schermerhorn.<br> Some days, of course,<br> the uptown gangs come down to us.<br> The Schermerhorns was one<br> of the oldest families in New York.<br> They didn 't run the city...<br> ...but they was listened<br> to carefully by them that did.<br> Commissioner Brunt<br> said you wished to view...<br> ...the Points in all<br> its splendor and squalor.<br> "Spare nothing concerning<br> the conditions," said he.<br> Yeah, nothing except<br> our safety, constable.<br> I'm sure we can be in no danger<br> while we're in the constable's company.<br> Quite so, madam.
