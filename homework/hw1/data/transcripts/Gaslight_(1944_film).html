                        Stand back.<br> No, Paula. Don't look back.<br> You've got to forget everything<br> that's happened here.<br> That's why you're going to Italy,<br> to Signor Guardi.<br> He was the best friend your aunt ever had,<br> and he'll be yours, too.<br> Perhaps Signor Guardi will make you<br> into a great singer, as she was.<br> Wouldn't you like that?<br> You must think of the future, dear,<br> not the past.<br> No. Now, look. Wait a moment, signorina.<br> There's no use.<br> Paula, you are not concentrating.<br> Your mind's not on your singing.<br> All these years you've worked so hard.<br> Now what's come over you?<br> This opera is tragedy, signorina.<br> You seem incapable of understanding.<br> Did you never hear your aunt sing Lucia?<br> You look like her.<br> But I don't sing like her. I know.<br> Signor Guardi,<br> may I speak to you seriously?<br> - Very seriously.<br> - Maestro.<br> It is 10 minutes to the hour.<br> If you're not continuing the lesson,<br> I'd like to be excused.<br> - Very well, Signor Anton.<br> - Thank you. Good afternoon, signorina.<br> Now, what is it you wish<br> to say to me seriously?<br> "Very seriously."<br> Signor Guardi, I've tried.<br> I've worked hard, but it's no use.<br> - I haven't the voice, have I?<br> - The trouble is not in your voice alone.<br> Your heart is not in your singing anymore.<br> Each time you come here now,<br> you look happier and you sing worse.<br> Tell me, Paula, you're in love?<br> Yes. It's something<br> that has never happened to me before...<br> something I never expected<br> would happen...<br> but suddenly<br> it is as if nothing else existed...<br> even my music,<br> which used to mean so much to me.<br> Yes, you are right. My thoughts<br> were wandering while singing just now.<br> I'm too happy. That's why you said...<br> the tragedy was something<br> I could never understand.<br> I'm sorry. It was cruel of me to say that...<br> cruel and untrue.<br> Real tragedy has touched your life...<br> and very deeply.<br> But now there is a chance<br> to forget tragedy, my child.<br> Take it. Free yourself from the past...<br> and forget your singing, too, for a while.<br> Happiness is better than art.<br> Dear Maestro, no one has ever been<br> as kind to me as you have since she died.<br> Will you let me meet the man<br> who is taking my pupil away from me?<br> Yes, of course.<br> You have a rendezvous with him.<br> The moment your lesson is over,<br> you fly to him.<br> Is he jealous of your music,<br> these hours you spend away from him?<br> Dear Maestro...<br> I don't know when we'll meet again.<br> Thank you.<br> - Did you tell him?<br> - He told me. He didn't know who.<br> - What did he say?<br> - He said I should take my happiness.<br> And will you? Now?<br> Why do you still hesitate, Paula?<br> But I don't know you.<br> I don't know anything about you.<br> Nor I about you, but I want to marry you.<br> - Are you afraid?<br> - I think I am, a little.<br> - Of me?<br> - No.<br> No, never, but of happiness.<br> I haven't had a lot,<br> and I feel I can't trust it.<br> You must give me time<br> to get used to the idea.<br> You shall have all the time you want.<br> I've waited for you so long.<br> Waited? We've only known<br> each other two weeks.<br> I've waited all my life till now.<br> I can wait a little longer.<br> But it will not be easy to wait,<br> to be patient, seeing you every day.<br> No, it won't be easy for me, either.<br> - I should go away.<br> - Go away?<br> By myself for a week, only a week...<br> just to know what I'm doing,<br> just to be sure.<br> - Where will you go?<br> - I thought perhaps to the Lakes.<br> - And when will you go?<br> - I thought tomorrow.<br> - Tomorrow?<br> - Is that too soon?<br> No, the sooner you go,<br> the sooner you will come back.<br> But while you're away, never forget<br> for one moment I'm here waiting...<br> and in love with you.<br> My dearest.<br> Oh, my goodness! Good gracious!<br> - It's so exciting.<br> - Your book?<br> Yes. It's about a girl who marries a man,<br> and what do you think?<br> - He's got six wives buried in the cellar.<br> - That seems a lot.<br> Yes, and I'm only on Page 200,<br> so I'm sure there's still more to come.<br> - It's a wonderful book.<br> - It sounds a little gruesome.<br> Yes. I'm afraid I enjoy a good murder<br> now and then.<br> My brother always calls me<br> "Bloodthirsty Bessie."<br> - Have a biscuit, dear.<br> - Thank you.<br> Digestive biscuits.<br> Unpleasant name, isn't it?<br> I always call them "diggy biscuits."<br> I never travel without them.<br> - You're not English, are you?<br> - No.<br> I was brought up there.<br> My aunt lived in London.<br> - Are you on your way there now?<br> - No. I'm going to Lake Como.<br> - All by yourself?<br> - Yes, all by myself.<br> - But is that wise?<br> - I don't think any harm will come to me.<br> I'm going to London.<br> I must be in London for the spring.<br> The crocuses, you know,<br> and the daffodils and the tulips.<br> The gardens are so beautiful in the spring.<br> I say "Good morning" to my flowers<br> in Thornton Square every day.<br> - Thornton Square?<br> - Yes. That's where I live, Number 16.<br> Do you know it?<br> - I know Thornton Square.<br> - Do you know anyone living there?<br> - I used to. Not anymore.<br> - I wonder who that could be.<br> I know almost everyone<br> who lives there now.<br> We're all so very friendly,<br> popping in and out of each other's houses.<br> - What number did your friends live at?<br> - I'm afraid I don't remember.<br> You know, we had a real,<br> live murder there.<br> Yes, I'd heard of it.<br> Unfortunately, it's before I went<br> to live there, just a year before.<br> Ten years ago, at Number 9,<br> a famous singer called Alice Alquist.<br> - Have another biscuit, dear.<br> - No, thank you.<br> It was a most mysterious case.<br> They never found out who killed her.<br> They never even found a motive.<br> I've tried to get in the house many a time.<br> I think it's so exciting. Don't you?<br> I mean, just to see.<br> Nothing's been changed...<br> - all the furniture and everything...<br> - I think we're getting into Como.<br> So we are.<br> - Is anyone meeting you?<br> - No.<br> - You will be careful, won't you?<br> - I will. Goodbye.<br> Goodbye. Come and see me<br> if you're ever in London.<br> My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites.<br> I'll point out the window of the room<br> in Number 9 where it happened.<br> You can see it from my drawing room.<br> - You're not angry with me?<br> - Angry?<br> If you hadn't come,<br> I should have sent for you.<br> Come and look at the morning.<br> Aren't you cold like this?<br> What were you dreaming of?<br> - Our life together.<br> - And how do you see it?<br> I saw all the places<br> where we'll be together.<br> Lovely places like this.<br> I was thinking of our life together, too,<br> only I heard it in music.<br> - Something that I want to write.<br> - Yes, what?<br> The whole thing is alive with happiness.<br> I want a feeling of the early morning.<br> - This morning.<br> - Yes.<br> With the sun rising,<br> lighting your hair as it is now.<br> I don't know how it ends.<br> Perhaps it never ends until I do.<br> - When will you start on it?<br> - Some day...<br> after we've had our honeymoon...<br> and settled down<br> in a home of our own somewhere.<br> - Where?<br> - Where would you like us to settle?<br> - I haven't thought. Paris, perhaps.<br> - Paris?<br> Or Rome?<br> How would you feel about London?<br> London?<br> Paula, if you won't laugh at me,<br> I'd like to tell you something.<br> I won't laugh at you. What is it?<br> It's an idea, a silly idea<br> that's been with me for years.<br> I was in London once in the winter.<br> It seemed there was no city<br> in the world...<br> that was colder to the homeless...<br> or that could be warmer<br> to the ones who had a home.<br> How I used to long<br> for a home of my own...<br> in one of those quiet houses<br> in the little London squares...<br> with the woman<br> I should one day come to love.<br> Could we settle down in London?<br> Not in a house in a square, perhaps...<br> Paula, why do you look like that?<br> - Because there is a house in a square.<br> - What house?<br> - She left it to me.<br> - She?<br> You mean Alice Alquist?<br> She was my mother's sister.<br> My mother died when I was born.<br> I don't know anything about her<br> or my father.<br> I lived with my aunt always<br> as if I were her own.<br> After it happened I never went back.<br> That house<br> comes into my dreams sometimes...<br> a house of horror.<br> It's strange.<br> I haven't dreamed of it<br> since I've known you.<br> I haven't been afraid since I've known you.<br> - Afraid?<br> - Yes.<br> For years I've been afraid<br> of something nameless...<br> ever since she died.<br> You've cast out fear for me.<br> If it were true,<br> it would make me very happy.<br> It is true. I've found peace in loving you.<br> - I could even face that house with you.<br> - No, Paula, beloved.<br> - I would not ask that of you.<br> - Yes, you shall have your dream.<br> You shall have your house in a square.<br> Good morning, daffodils.<br> Good morning, tulips.<br> Percy! There it is, dear.<br> What are you doing, my good man?<br> Turning on the water<br> in Number 9, ma'am.<br> Nine? Why nine?<br> Orders, ma'am.<br> It must be going to be occupied at last,<br> after all these years.<br> Wouldn't care to live in there, myself.<br> I don't know about living there,<br> but I would like to get a peep inside.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Are we late?<br> - Not at all. I've only been here a moment.<br> - Good morning, Mr. Anton.<br> - Good morning.<br> It's you. Don't you remember me?<br> In the train in Italy last month.<br> Diggy biscuits.<br> Yes, of course, I do.<br> Don't tell me<br> you're coming to live in Number 9?<br> Yes.<br> We mustn't keep Mr. Mufflin waiting.<br> - Sorry, I must go now. Perhaps we can...<br> - I'll call directly you're settled.<br> That's my house over there,<br> with the pink curtains.<br> Goodbye, for the present.<br> Goodbye. I'm so glad<br> we are to be neighbors.<br> So am I.<br> This lock needs oiling.<br> If there's anything further I can do,<br> let me hear from you. Good day.<br> - Good day.<br> - Good day, Mr. Anton.<br> Now, Paula...<br> - This is the dining room?<br> - Yes.<br> There's a little study beyond it.<br> - And the drawing room is upstairs?<br> - Yes.<br> Come, Paula.<br> Don't stand there in the doorway.<br> Will you light the gas, please?<br> - Gregory.<br> - It's a very handsome room.<br> Yes, but to see it like this...<br> I remember parties in this room<br> when it was full of flowers and light.<br> Those must have been wonderful days.<br> It's all dead in here.<br> The whole place seems to smell of death.<br> There. It will all be fresh again<br> in a moment.<br> That's where she kept her treasures.<br> Things she collected<br> on her tours around the world.<br> - The glass is broken.<br> - It was broken that night.<br> All the things were disarranged,<br> but there was nothing missing.<br> I know all these by heart.<br> It was a great treat<br> when she'd unlock them...<br> and take them out<br> and tell me all their stories.<br> - Careful, dearest.<br> - She wore this glove in Romeo and Juliet...<br> at the command performance<br> at Covent Garden.<br> Gounod signed it for her afterwards.<br> I never knew what happened<br> to the other glove.<br> I used to ask her sometimes...<br> but she'd only laugh<br> and say she'd given it away.<br> A very great admirer.<br> She would never tell me who.<br> I wish I could have seen her.<br> Let me show her to you.<br> That's as the Empress Theodora.<br> That was her greatest role.<br> When she sang it in St. Petersburg...<br> the Czar used to come<br> to every performance.<br> She was very beautiful,<br> very much like you.<br> It was there that I found her,<br> there in front of the fire...<br> under her own portrait.<br> I was in bed, and something woke me.<br> I've never known what.<br> I came running down the stairs...<br> frightened, as if I knew<br> what had happened.<br> She had been strangled.<br> She had been strangled.<br> Her lovely face was all...<br> No, I can't stay here.<br> Then how would it be if we took away<br> all these things that remind you so of her?<br> The painting, all this furniture.<br> Shut it away so you can't even see it?<br> Suppose we make it a new house<br> with new things, beautiful things...<br> for a new, beautiful life for us.<br> Yes, and then later,<br> we'll have people here and parties again.<br> - Don't you want to?<br> - Later, yes, but not just at once.<br> Let us have our honeymoon here<br> by ourselves for a little longer.<br> - Yes. I only...<br> - I know.<br> Later.<br> Now, where should we put<br> all these things?<br> There is an attic under the roof.<br> All her trunks are up there<br> and all her costumes.<br> Then we'll put all these there, too,<br> and then we'll board it up...<br> so you'll never have to see it again,<br> never even think of it.<br> That piano traveled with her everywhere<br> in the great days.<br> It will need tuning terribly.<br> Look, here's some of her music.<br> Her score of Theodora, just as she left it.<br> We'll send those upstairs with all the rest.<br> No, not her music.<br> Perhaps later I might like to study again.<br> I'd like to have her scores to study from.<br> - What makes you play that?<br> - Why not?<br> That was her great song.<br> She always used it in her concerts<br> for her last encore.<br> It was everybody's favorite.<br> Here's an old letter.<br> "Dear Miss Alquist,<br> I beg of you to see me just once more.<br> "I have followed you to London."<br> It was written two days<br> before she was murdered.<br> - Where did you find that?<br> - In this score. She must have left it there.<br> It was written by somebody<br> called Sergis Bauer.<br> Give it to me!<br> - Gregory, what is it?<br> - I'm sorry...<br> I didn't mean to be so violent.<br> It's just that...<br> Why does this letter upset you so?<br> It's not the letter.<br> It's just that I am upset for you.<br> All these things are reminding you of her.<br> You said that you had lost your fears,<br> and now everything you touch here...<br> brings them back.<br> While you are afraid of anything,<br> there cannot be any happiness for us.<br> You must forget her.<br> No, not her.<br> Only what happened to her.<br> Elizabeth! I say! Elizabeth!<br> - Good afternoon, Elizabeth.<br> - It's you, miss.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - The house is looking very nice now.<br> - What's that, miss?<br> I said, the house looks very nice now...<br> - from the outside.<br> - Yes, miss.<br> I expect you're glad<br> you got rid of the workmen at last.<br> Yes, miss.<br> Do you think that Mr. And Mrs. Anton<br> will be ready to receive callers soon?<br> I couldn't say, miss, I'm sure.<br> We haven't had no visitors yet.<br> Master says seeing people<br> isn't good for her.<br> She hasn't been feeling too well lately.<br> - I'm sorry to hear that.<br> - What's that, miss?<br> I said, this fine summer weather<br> we're having ought to do her good.<br> Yes, miss.<br> They're going out this afternoon.<br> First time for some while. Good day, miss.<br> Good day.<br> What lovely-looking strawberries.<br> I never get big ones like that.<br> I think I'll just taste one for luck.<br> Good afternoon.<br> If you have your bags,<br> you can start immediately.<br> - Thank you, sir. They're downstairs, sir.<br> - Then everything is arranged.<br> - Your wages will be 16 a year.<br> - Yes, sir. I understand all right, sir.<br> Just one more thing...<br> I don't want you to bother your mistress<br> about anything, ever.<br> If you have any questions,<br> just come to me.<br> Yes, sir.<br> That'll suit me, sir.<br> Then you'll remember it.<br> Your predecessor did not.<br> That's why she left.<br> It may seem a little unusual...<br> but your mistress is inclined<br> to be rather highly strung.<br> Elizabeth, come in.<br> This is Elizabeth, the cook.<br> - Hello.<br> - You'll find that she's a little deaf.<br> - Hello.<br> - Elizabeth, this is our new housemaid.<br> I was explaining her duties to her.<br> She'll be down in a moment.<br> Very good, sir. I'll see you downstairs.<br> - She's a tartar, ain't she?<br> - What do you mean by that?<br> You know, strict-like.<br> I'm not gonna sleep<br> in the same room with her.<br> You see the way she looked at me?<br> Don't you think perhaps your costume<br> might have something to do with it?<br> - What's the matter with it?<br> - It's a little, shall we say, loud?<br> - I hope you're not a flighty girl, Lucy.<br> - My name's Nancy, sir.<br> I'm sorry, Nancy. Are you?<br> - I don't think so, sir.<br> - I'm glad to hear that.<br> Your mistress is very particular<br> about everything being very correct.<br> - Is she, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> So am I.<br> This is our new housemaid.<br> - How do you do?<br> - I'm all right, ma'am.<br> - You can go now, Nancy.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> She seems a nice girl.<br> I'm glad. I hope I haven't kept you waiting.<br> I had to go back for the guidebook.<br> You look like a summer's day.<br> Because I'm happy. We're going out,<br> and I'm going to show you London.<br> - Do you know what day today is?<br> - Yes.<br> Three months ago today...<br> we came out of that little church<br> by the lake, man and wife.<br> I have a present for you, Paula.<br> Where did you find anything so beautiful?<br> It belonged to my mother,<br> and before that to her mother...<br> and now it belongs to you.<br> I shall wear it always.<br> Always, my dear.<br> How sweet of you to give me this.<br> I'm afraid the pin is not very strong.<br> - No.<br> - I'll have it mended.<br> You better not wear it until I have.<br> You might lose it.<br> You know, you are inclined to lose things.<br> - I am? I didn't realize that.<br> - Just little things.<br> I'll put it in your bag for safekeeping.<br> There.<br> Now, you'll remember where it is.<br> - Don't be silly. Of course I'll remember.<br> - I was teasing you, my dear.<br> - That's London.<br> - It's music.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - Good afternoon, ma'am.<br> It's nice to see you getting out again.<br> - Where to, ma'am?<br> - The Tower of London.<br> Very good, ma'am.<br> The Tower of London it is.<br> What's the matter with the mistress?<br> She don't look ill to me. Is she?<br> I don't know. Not as I can see.<br> But the master keeps telling her she is.<br> Here, ladies and gentlemen,<br> we have the ax of the headsman...<br> and the execution block.<br> These are the originals with which<br> such historic persons as Lady Jane Grey...<br> and Queen Catherine Howard<br> was beheaded within these precincts.<br> The victim, kneeling,<br> laid his head upon the block...<br> fitted his neck into the small,<br> hollowed-out space...<br> designed to receive it,<br> whereupon the ax descended...<br> severing the head<br> from the torso with one blow...<br> or in unlucky cases, two.<br> Moving to our right,<br> we have a model of the famous rack...<br> the instrument of torture<br> upon which prisoners were stretched...<br> their limbs being frequently torn<br> from their sockets...<br> in an effort to extract<br> a confession from them, true or false.<br> There you are.<br> I wondered what had become of you.<br> It was so close in there.<br> Let's go out into the sunshine.<br> - Are we going to see the torture chamber?<br> - Certainly. I think it's right over here.<br> Uncle Brian, what's the matter?<br> You look as if you've seen a ghost.<br> - That's exactly what I thought I'd seen.<br> - There's no such thing as a ghost.<br> I know. I meant I just thought<br> I saw someone I know is dead.<br> I have no idea who he is.<br> He seemed to know me and...<br> Do you usually bow<br> to people you don't know?<br> No. I supposed I'd met him somewhere.<br> - Are you telling me the truth?<br> - Of course. Why should I lie?<br> - I don't know who he is.<br> - Yet you smiled at him. Why?<br> I tell you, I wasn't thinking.<br> I don't know why I did it.<br> Like the other things.<br> - What other things?<br> - Nothing.<br> Only I've been noticing, Paula, that...<br> - you've been forgetful lately.<br> - Forgetful?<br> Losing things and...<br> Don't look so worried, Paula.<br> It's nothing.<br> - You get tired and...<br> - Yes, that's probably what it is. I get tired.<br> - I'm tired now. Can't we go home?<br> - No, we still have the crown jewels to see.<br> - They're in that building over there.<br> - How do you know?<br> What did you say?<br> How do you know where they are?<br> You haven't been here before.<br> The guide told us inside.<br> Are you becoming suspicious<br> as well as absent-minded, Paula?<br> No, of course not, Gregory.<br> The Kohinoor or "Mountain of Light."<br> It's the most famous diamond<br> in the world.<br> "The imperial state crown...<br> - That's that one.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> "...was made for the coronation<br> of Queen Victoria.<br> "Among the jewels it contains<br> are the ruby of the Black Prince...<br> "the size of a hen's egg,<br> the Stuart sapphire...<br> "which was among the jewels...<br> "James II took with him<br> when he fled to France...<br> "and the diamonds and pearls<br> from the earrings of Queen Elizabeth."<br> Jewels are wonderful things.<br> They have a life of their own.<br> Gregory, can't we go home now?<br> Of course, my dear. I'll take you home.<br> That's the mistress's room.<br> That's the master's.<br> We've got all this to see to.<br> Have you got the sheets there?<br> I could have sworn<br> that there were more than that, but...<br> - What's up there?<br> - Never mind about up there.<br> - The whole floor's been boarded off.<br> - Why?<br> That's the way the master wanted it.<br> You were right.<br> There is nothing more beautiful<br> than London in sunshine.<br> I'm sorry I spoiled the day<br> by bringing you home so soon.<br> You should lie down<br> and rest for a little, Paula.<br> Should I stay with you<br> and not go out this evening?<br> No. You go and work as usual.<br> Can you really work<br> in that room you rented?<br> I wish you'd let me see it<br> and make it attractive.<br> I never notice my surroundings<br> when I'm working.<br> You might give me your broach<br> so I can have it repaired.<br> What's the matter? Anything wrong?<br> I can't find it.<br> What?<br> I missed it when we were in the Tower.<br> I must turn everything out.<br> I know it was here. I can't understand it.<br> I couldn't have lost it. It must be here.<br> I'm sure it's there.<br> It's not.<br> Paula, didn't I tell you?<br> How did you come to lose it?<br> I must have pulled it out<br> with something, I suppose.<br> - I'm terribly sorry. Please forgive me.<br> - Forgive, my dear?<br> It's not as serious as that.<br> It's not valuable.<br> Your present to me, your mother's broach.<br> I wanted to wear it always.<br> I don't remember opening my bag.<br> I suppose I must have.<br> You did put it in there?<br> Don't you even remember that?<br> Yes, of course, I do.<br> But suddenly, I am beginning<br> not to trust my memory at all.<br> I tell you, you're just tired, that's all.<br> It doesn't mean anything.<br> I'm sure it doesn't.<br> Don't worry so, Paula. Don't worry.<br> - Nancy, has the master left?<br> - Yes, ma'am. A little while ago.<br> Please see that he has plenty of coal<br> on the fire in his room.<br> You already told me that, ma'am.<br> Nancy, did you turn the gas up in there?<br> Turn it up? No, why?<br> I thought it went down in here,<br> as if you had.<br> - I never touched it.<br> - But this went down.<br> Perhaps Elizabeth<br> lit another jet in the kitchen.<br> Couldn't have been her.<br> She's been in bed for an hour.<br> I could hear her snoring.<br> That's odd.<br> - Good night, Nancy.<br> - Good night, ma'am.<br> - Yes, that's it.<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> I said that's it. That's the Alquist house.<br> It happened in the drawing room, upstairs.<br> That window.<br> I live just across the square.<br> My name is Thwaites, Miss Thwaites.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Perhaps you could tell me,<br> has the house been occupied long?<br> About four or five months now.<br> Come along.<br> You don't happen to know<br> who's living in the house, do you?<br> Yes. A foreign couple. Anton's the name.<br> Something mysterious there.<br> - What do you mean, mysterious?<br> - Never have visitors...<br> never go out anywhere.<br> At least, she doesn't.<br> I think you're wrong.<br> There aren't as many as usual here today.<br> Come along, pigeons.<br> Come along, sparrows. What did you say?<br> You seem to be wrong<br> about her not going out.<br> How very surprising.<br> It's you, ma'am.<br> I never knew you'd gone out.<br> I went for a walk,<br> but it looks as if it might rain...<br> - so I thought I should have my umbrella.<br> - Of course, ma'am.<br> Suppose the master comes back<br> and asks where you've gone?<br> - Tell him I just went for a walk.<br> - By yourself, ma'am?<br> - Of course. Why not?<br> - Suppose the master asks where?<br> Tell him I just...<br> Now do you see what I mean?<br> Goes out, goes back, goes in.<br> Odd. Definitely odd.<br> It's an odd household, too.<br> That maidservant, most impertinent.<br> I can't get a thing out of her.<br> She won't talk to me...<br> though she would quick enough<br> if I wore trousers.<br> The way she carries on<br> with that policeman on the beat.<br> It's scandalous!<br> There, that's all there is.<br> Fly away, pigeons. More tomorrow.<br> Well!<br> Paper! Thank you, sir. There you are, sir.<br> Extra. Special. Special edition.<br> Read all about it.<br> Here you are, governor. Paper?<br> Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.<br> Put that file back where you got it.<br> I tell you, the case is dead.<br> I'm not going to have it all dug up again<br> for nothing.<br> Do you understand?<br> You had no right to go through that file.<br> - Budge had no right to let you get at it.<br> - Sorry, General.<br> - Mr. Cameron is your assistant...<br> - Then it's his job to assist me...<br> not go digging into 10-year-old cases<br> on wild suspicions of his own.<br> - Now then, Budge, you get along.<br> - Very good, General.<br> What's your interest in this case, anyway?<br> It was rather a famous case...<br> and it impressed me very much<br> at the time.<br> Besides...<br> I once met Alice Alquist.<br> I was taken to hear her...<br> at a command performance<br> when I was 12 years old...<br> and afterwards<br> to meet her in the artists' room.<br> It sounds silly, but I still think<br> she was the most beautiful woman...<br> I ever saw, and I've never forgotten her.<br> - And now...<br> - You've seen someone who looks like her.<br> - Living in the same house.<br> - Why shouldn't she?<br> If she's the niece,<br> the house probably belongs to her.<br> And if you're trying to meet<br> a pretty woman...<br> you've no right to use official business<br> as an excuse.<br> It's not that, sir.<br> But I tell you, sir, I have a feeling<br> there's something peculiar going on there.<br> Perhaps even more than peculiar.<br> Look here, Brian, once and for all,<br> the case was given up as hopeless.<br> As for the matter of the jewels,<br> that was dropped by order...<br> of a most important personage.<br> Jewels?<br> There's nothing here about jewels.<br> There were some jewels.<br> They were given to her...<br> by somebody very highly placed.<br> Some of the crown jewels of his...<br> - Of another country, as a matter of fact.<br> - What happened to them?<br> - They disappeared.<br> - That's why she was murdered.<br> That was the official theory.<br> Though what the murderer<br> wanted the jewels for I can't imagine.<br> They were too famous<br> for him to be able to sell them.<br> - Have they never shown up since?<br> - Not as far as I know.<br> Well then, where are they?<br> I don't know. The murder part of the case<br> was pursued to the utmost...<br> as you can see for yourself from that file.<br> There was never any case against anyone.<br> There were the usual blind-alley suspects.<br> You've read all their names there<br> in that stuff.<br> And there was never anything<br> to prove against any of them.<br> Now run along, there's a good fellow.<br> I'm busy.<br> Very well, sir.<br> Good day, sir.<br> - Afternoon, Mr. Cameron.<br> - Williams.<br> - Did you want me, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> Tell me, you're not a married man,<br> are you?<br> No, sir.<br> - Where are you on duty now?<br> - Down in the East End, sir.<br> How would you like<br> a more fashionable locality?<br> - I'd like it very much, sir.<br> - We'll see what can be done about it.<br> Don't say anything to anybody<br> for the moment.<br> If you want coal on the fire, Paula,<br> why don't you ring for the maid?<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.<br> Go back to sleep, dear.<br> No, Paula.<br> Now that you have wakened me,<br> we might as well be comfortable.<br> - Ring for the maid.<br> - I can put it on myself.<br> We've had this subject out before.<br> Please, pull the bell cord.<br> It seems so unnecessary.<br> What do you suppose the servants are for?<br> Answer me.<br> What do you suppose the servants are for?<br> To do things. To serve us, I suppose.<br> Exactly.<br> It's only that I think<br> we should consider them a little.<br> Don't be cross with me.<br> I'm not cross with you.<br> There are a lot of things...<br> - Did you ring, sir?<br> - No. Your mistress rang.<br> Go on. Why don't you tell Nancy<br> what you rang for?<br> - A little coal on the fire, please, Nancy.<br> - Very good, madam.<br> You're looking very pretty this afternoon,<br> do you know that?<br> I don't know it at all, sir, I'm sure.<br> - Tonight is your night out, isn't it?<br> - That's right, sir.<br> Whom are you meeting tonight?<br> You might light the gas, too, Nancy.<br> I see they've changed<br> the policeman on the beat.<br> Is his heart going to be added<br> to the list of those you've broken?<br> - I didn't know I'd broken any, sir.<br> - I'm sure that's not true.<br> And that complexion of yours...<br> that's something<br> that's not quite true, either.<br> You do it very cleverly, I grant you.<br> In fact, I was wondering<br> whether you might not care...<br> to pass some of your secrets<br> on to your mistress...<br> and help her get rid of her pallor.<br> Sure. I'd be very pleased<br> to do anything I can, sir.<br> - Will that be all you're wanting?<br> - Yes, except tea when it's ready.<br> Very good, sir.<br> How can you talk to Nancy like that?<br> You seem so anxious<br> to regard the servants as your equals.<br> I thought I would treat her as one.<br> Besides, I was only trifling with her.<br> No wonder that girl despises me,<br> the way you encourage her.<br> Despises you?<br> Whatever makes you think that?<br> Her whole manner!<br> The way she talks to me,<br> the way she looks at me.<br> Looks at you?<br> I hope you're not starting<br> to imagine things again.<br> - You're not, are you, Paula?<br> - Of course I'm not.<br> I hope you're not, but if you start talking<br> about the way Nancy looks at you...<br> Don't turn away, Paula.<br> We must have this out.<br> Do you really think Nancy despises you?<br> Answer me, Paula. Do you?<br> No, Gregory.<br> I'm glad of that.<br> It hurts me when you're ill and fanciful.<br> Come in.<br> What is it now?<br> If you please, sir,<br> Miss Thwaites is downstairs.<br> She wanted to know<br> if the mistress was at home.<br> You mean that old busybody<br> from across the square?<br> Yes, sir. She has her nephew with her.<br> I don't think<br> we need bore ourselves with them.<br> - Tell her your mistress is not at home.<br> - Gregory, really, she's been...<br> My dear, if you let her in once,<br> you'll always have her here.<br> But she's called so often,<br> and we've never been at home to her...<br> I do not want people all over this house!<br> Bringing her family with her.<br> You tell Miss Thwaites...<br> that your mistress is sorry,<br> but she's not well enough to see her.<br> Very good, sir.<br> Gregory, why did you do that?<br> I would've liked to have seen her.<br> I thought you were only trying<br> to be polite.<br> Why didn't you tell me<br> you really wanted to see her?<br> I couldn't in front of that girl.<br> You must get over<br> this ridiculous fear of the servants.<br> If you really wanted to see her,<br> all you had to say was:<br> "Show her up, Nancy," wasn't it?<br> - Yes, but...<br> - I'm sorry, miss. That's all I know.<br> The mistress isn't well enough<br> to receive anyone.<br> Please tell her how sorry we are.<br> Come along, Auntie dear.<br> You wouldn't have had time<br> to see them anyway.<br> You have to dress, do your hair.<br> Why?<br> We're going out tonight.<br> We are? You didn't tell me.<br> Or have I forgotten?<br> Don't you think this is charming?<br> It's from the new operetta at the Gaiety.<br> I wish I could write tunes like Strauss.<br> Paula, you silly child, don't look like that.<br> Of course you haven't forgotten anything.<br> This is my surprise for you.<br> We're going to the theater tonight.<br> How wonderful!<br> - And you thought I was being cruel to you.<br> - No, you're not cruel.<br> Keeping people away from you,<br> making you a prisoner.<br> You're the kindest man in the world.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm so happy.<br> What's the matter?<br> Paula, I don't want to upset you.<br> If you will put things right...<br> when I'm not looking,<br> we'll assume it did not happen.<br> But what? Gregory, what?<br> Please don't turn your back on me.<br> What has happened?<br> You mean you don't know?<br> No, I...<br> Look.<br> Yes.<br> The little picture has been taken down.<br> Who took it down?<br> - Why has it been taken down?<br> - Why indeed?<br> Why was it taken down before?<br> Get it from wherever you've hidden it<br> and put it back in its place.<br> But I haven't hidden it.<br> I swear I haven't. Why should I?<br> Don't look at me like that.<br> Someone else must have done it.<br> No, don't ring. Please don't ring.<br> - Don't shame me before the servants.<br> - Please stop being hysterical.<br> Now sit down and calm yourself<br> before they come.<br> We must get to the bottom of this<br> once and for all.<br> Please come in, Elizabeth.<br> Do you notice anything missing<br> from this room?<br> Missing, sir?<br> No. I don't think so, sir.<br> Look carefully on the walls.<br> - There's a little picture missing, sir.<br> - Exactly.<br> - Did you take it away?<br> - No, sir.<br> Have you ever taken it down<br> from where it belongs?<br> - No, sir. Why ever should I?<br> - Why indeed?<br> You go to church, don't you?<br> - To what, sir?<br> - Church!<br> Yes, sir.<br> Please kiss this Bible as a solemn oath<br> that you've told the truth.<br> Thank you, Elizabeth. You may go now.<br> And send Nancy in here at once.<br> - Nancy.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Gregory, no, not that girl.<br> I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it.<br> I'll not have that...<br> Please! Have the goodness<br> to control yourself.<br> This is painful enough<br> without your making it worse.<br> Please come back.<br> Since you've thrown suspicion<br> on the servants...<br> they must be cleared of it. Now sit down.<br> Did you hear what I said?<br> Sit down.<br> Come here, Nancy.<br> A picture has been taken down<br> from the wall there.<br> So it has. That's another rum go.<br> I did not ask<br> for any comments on your part.<br> I want to know whether it was you<br> who took the picture down.<br> Of course it wasn't, sir.<br> What would I want to take it down for?<br> Shall I ask her to kiss the Bible, Paula,<br> or will you accept her word?<br> - Of course I'll accept it. Let her go.<br> - Very well. You may go, Nancy.<br> Give me that Bible!<br> There. Do you see? I swear on the Bible<br> I didn't take that picture down.<br> Go look for that picture.<br> So you knew where it was all the time.<br> I didn't know.<br> I only looked there because that's<br> where it was found twice before.<br> I didn't know, Gregory.<br> I didn't.<br> I think you better go to your room.<br> We're not going to the theater?<br> I'm afraid you are far from well enough<br> for the theater.<br> Now come.<br> - If it was I who took that picture down...<br> - lf?<br> If it was I who took it down<br> the other times...<br> if I do all these senseless,<br> meaningless things...<br> It's so meaningless.<br> Why should I take a picture down?<br> - Then I don't know what I do anymore.<br> - I know, Paula.<br> - That's just the trouble.<br> - But then, if that's true...<br> then you must be gentle with me.<br> You must bear with me, please.<br> Please, Gregory, please.<br> Now come, Paula.<br> - You better go to your room.<br> - What are you going to do?<br> I'm going out to work and forget all this.<br> No. Please don't leave me here<br> all by myself now.<br> I get so frightened when I am here alone<br> and you go out night after night.<br> Frightened? You never<br> told me that before.<br> I'm telling you now!<br> I'm frightened of the house!<br> I hear noises and footsteps.<br> I imagine things,<br> that there are people over the house.<br> I'm frightened of myself, too.<br> Gregory, please!<br> Please don't leave me. Stay with me.<br> Gregory, take me in your arms, please!<br> Please. Take me in your arms, Gregory.<br> I hope to find you better in the morning.<br> She seems to be getting worse,<br> doesn't she, sir?<br> You will please not refer<br> to your mistress as "she."<br> Thank you, Nancy.<br> Gonna work on your tunes<br> again tonight, sir?<br> - You're always working, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> What are you doing<br> with your evening out?<br> I'm going to a music hall.<br> - I've never been to an English music hall.<br> - You don't know what you've missed, sir.<br> - You'd like it a lot, sir.<br> - We must see about that.<br> And whom are you going<br> to the music hall with?<br> Gentleman friend, sir.<br> Now, you know, Nancy, don't you...<br> that gentleman friends<br> are sometimes inclined...<br> - to take liberties with young ladies?<br> - No, sir, not with me.<br> I can take care of myself when I want to.<br> It strikes me that you're not at all<br> the kind of girl that your mistress...<br> - should have for a housemaid.<br> - No, sir?<br> She's not the only one<br> in the house, is she?<br> Let people find their own places<br> for the concert.<br> Just sit where they like.<br> Those who don't care for music<br> can go into the smoking room.<br> - May I come in?<br> - Brian.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening, Lady Dalroy.<br> How are you, sir?<br> - How are you, my boy? Nice to see you.<br> - Am I the first to arrive?<br> I have a favor to ask. Are you having<br> a sit-down supper afterwards?<br> Yes, and I've put you<br> next to Laura Pritchard.<br> I don't like Laura Pritchard.<br> She's got adenoids.<br> Nonsense. She's a most agreeable girl,<br> and I want you to be very nice to her.<br> Haven't you learned yet<br> that Mildred is an incurable matchmaker?<br> I'll be nice to Miss Pritchard another time.<br> Tonight I want you to be very kind<br> and put me next to Mrs. Anton. Will you?<br> - It's most tiresome of you. All right.<br> - Who's Mrs. Anton?<br> She's the niece of Alice Alquist.<br> She used to come here as a child.<br> Brian told me she was back in London<br> now and married...<br> so I invited them to come tonight.<br> Who's Mr. Anton, by the way?<br> What does he do?<br> Where does he come from?<br> Put me next to her tonight,<br> and I'll find out for you.<br> I'm sorry, Brian, but you'll have to<br> sit next to the Pritchard girl after all.<br> - The Antons can't come.<br> - No.<br> - Letter from her?<br> - No. From him.<br> - Him?<br> - Yes. Apparently she's ill.<br> Very tiresome of her.<br> Read it if you want to.<br> I must go and order the tables.<br> Come on, Freddy. I want you.<br> Is that you, Paula?<br> Yes.<br> Why are you dressed up like that?<br> Because tonight<br> is Lady Dalroy's reception.<br> But I sent a note.<br> I know.<br> I sent a note to say<br> you were not well enough.<br> I'm quite well enough, and I want to go.<br> Lady Dalroy was very kind to me<br> when I was small...<br> and I am going.<br> I must get out of this house,<br> meet people...<br> and see a little<br> of what's going on in the world.<br> I am going to this reception, Gregory.<br> Then I'm afraid you'll have to go alone.<br> Then I must go alone.<br> I didn't realize this party<br> meant so much to you.<br> I'll go and change immediately.<br> You didn't really think<br> I would let you go alone, did you?<br> - I don't know.<br> - I shan't be a minute.<br> Come in.<br> Coo. Did you ring for something, ma'am?<br> - Yes. Please fetch a cab.<br> - But I thought you were...<br> Get a cab, Nancy.<br> - Is the master going out, too?<br> - Yes, he is.<br> - Please hurry.<br> - Very good, ma'am.<br> Cabby!<br> Beckoning a cab on your evening out?<br> Yes. I'm going out to dinner<br> at Buckingham Palace, I am.<br> - I'm gonna have a lovely evening out.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> First they're going out, then they're not.<br> Changing all my plans.<br> Never a word to me from him.<br> You better get along.<br> They'll be out in a minute.<br> - See you Sunday?<br> - Perhaps.<br> - Usual place?<br> - Usual place.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Draw your cloak around you. It's damp.<br> Dalroy House.<br> - Good night, Nancy.<br> - Have a nice evening, sir.<br> You're Paula Anton.<br> I'm sure you don't remember me.<br> I do indeed, Lady Dalroy.<br> It was at the children's party here,<br> and there was a magician.<br> - May I introduce my husband, Lady Dalroy.<br> - How do you do?<br> I hope you will forgive all the confusion...<br> but my wife suddenly felt much better,<br> and we were so anxious to come.<br> But of course.<br> You'll find some seats over there.<br> Seratsky hasn't played yet.<br> I'll see you later at supper.<br> - What are you looking at?<br> - Nothing.<br> I thought I saw someone I knew, that's all.<br> My watch is gone.<br> - I didn't put it there. I swear I didn't put...<br> - Would you be quiet, please?<br> Paula, please control yourself.<br> - Being seen like this in public.<br> - No.<br> Come.<br> I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid<br> my wife's illness has returned.<br> - Can I send for a doctor?<br> - No. If I can just get her home.<br> We shouldn't have come tonight,<br> but she was so anxious.<br> I'm so sorry, Lady Dalroy.<br> I think it's the most...<br> I've tried so hard to keep it<br> within these walls, in my own house.<br> Now, because you would go out tonight,<br> the whole of London knows it.<br> If I could only get inside<br> that brain of yours...<br> and understand what makes you<br> do these crazy, twisted things.<br> Are you trying to tell me I'm insane?<br> - That's what I'm trying not to tell myself.<br> - But that's what you think, isn't it?<br> That's what you've been hinting<br> and suggesting for months, ever since...<br> - Since what?<br> - Since the day I lost your broach.<br> Yes, that's when it all began.<br> No, it began before that.<br> The first day here,<br> when I found that letter.<br> - What letter?<br> - The one I found among the music...<br> from that man called Bauer.<br> Sergis Bauer. Yes, I remember.<br> Yes, you're right. That's when it began.<br> I can see you still,<br> standing there and saying:<br> "Look at this letter,"<br> and staring at nothing.<br> - What?<br> - You had nothing in your hand.<br> What?<br> I was staggered, but I didn't know then...<br> how much reason I had to be.<br> - I don't know. What reason?<br> - I didn't know then about your mother.<br> What about my mother?<br> Your mother was mad.<br> She died in an asylum<br> when you were a year old.<br> That's not true.<br> I've been making inquiries<br> about Alice Alquist's sister.<br> I've talked to the doctor who attended her.<br> - Would you like to see him?<br> - No.<br> He described her symptoms to me.<br> Would you like to hear them?<br> It began with her imagining things,<br> that she heard noises, footsteps, voices...<br> and then the voices began to speak to her.<br> In the end, she died in an asylum<br> with no brain at all.<br> No! Please stop.<br> Now perhaps you will understand<br> a lot of things about yourself and me.<br> Now perhaps you will understand<br> why I cannot let you meet people.<br> He must have been rather disappointed<br> that you left before he could talk to you.<br> Who?<br> The man who was sitting behind us.<br> - Where?<br> - Tonight.<br> You only went because you knew<br> he would be there.<br> What, Gregory? Who?<br> The man who bowed to you that day<br> at the Tower.<br> Who is he, someone from the past?<br> Someone you refused, perhaps?<br> I never met him.<br> I have no idea who he is.<br> Who is he?<br> Why is he dogging my footsteps?<br> I don't know that he is.<br> - You lie. Why do you lie to me?<br> - I never lie to you.<br> I'm sorry. I should not have said that.<br> I know you never lie to me. I believe you.<br> You're not lying. It's worse than lying.<br> You've forgotten. You've forgotten him<br> as you forget everything.<br> But perhaps I'm wrong<br> to try to handle this myself.<br> The case is one for people<br> who know about those things.<br> We shall have visitors, and shortly.<br> - A doctor?<br> - Two.<br> I believe two is the required number.<br> Yes?<br> It's you, Constable.<br> Good evening, sir.<br> - Nasty night to be out, isn't it?<br> - Very nasty, sir, indeed.<br> Where'd he go?<br> He didn't get past me as<br> I came through the alley.<br> He certainly turned in here.<br> You must have missed him in the fog.<br> I'd have heard his footsteps<br> as he passed, Mr. Cameron.<br> He must've gone<br> into the rear of one of these houses.<br> Yes, but which? And why?<br> Do you think he could have gone<br> into his own house?<br> - If he did, sir, that's not against the law.<br> - No, but it's against common sense.<br> Why should he walk out of his own house<br> and all the way around the corner...<br> just to get back to where he started from?<br> But the service entrance to Number 9<br> is out front.<br> There's no way into Number 9<br> from back here.<br> - Then where did he go?<br> - Number 5 is empty.<br> But what would he want to go<br> into an empty house for?<br> I don't know, Williams.<br> Just coming, ma'am.<br> What is it, ma'am?<br> - I want you to help me. I'm so tired.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Did you turn on the gas?<br> Did you turn on the gas<br> anywhere downstairs just now?<br> Why, no, ma'am. I've had it on<br> in the kitchen all evening, that's all.<br> I thought it went down in there,<br> as if someone...<br> had turned it on<br> in some other part of the house.<br> There's no one in the house<br> but me, ma'am. Nancy's not back yet.<br> But the gas comes in pipes, ma'am.<br> And I expect they get more gas<br> in the pipes at some times...<br> than they does at others.<br> Yes, I suppose that could explain it.<br> - Do you hear anything?<br> - Hear anything, ma'am?<br> - Yes. Up there. Listen.<br> - Listen to what, ma'am?<br> Those sounds. Those noises up there.<br> No, ma'am.<br> But there are sounds.<br> Sounds like someone moving about.<br> - Elizabeth, listen, please.<br> - There are no noises up there, ma'am.<br> How could there be?<br> The whole floor is boarded up.<br> You know that as well as I do.<br> No one can't get in up there.<br> You know, ma'am,<br> you just imagine things.<br> Williams, come in. You're early.<br> Get another cup, will you?<br> - Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Well?<br> I don't know what it means,<br> but this morning around 3:00...<br> I was standing on the corner of<br> Thornton Square, looking both ways-like...<br> and suddenly, who should I see turning up,<br> but our friend again.<br> - Coming out of the mews, it looked like.<br> - Yes?<br> I got a good look at him<br> under the lamppost.<br> I tell you, that man<br> had been up to something.<br> What?<br> I wouldn't undertake to say what exactly...<br> but he was kind of in a mess.<br> Clothes untidy, tie all on one side.<br> Dirt and dust all over, even on his face.<br> - Had he been in a fight?<br> - He didn't look like that, sir.<br> More as though he'd been digging<br> in a cellar or something.<br> Have some coffee.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I've had my breakfast already.<br> Had it in the kitchen at Number 9,<br> as a matter of fact.<br> Nancy tell you anything this morning?<br> If you ask me, Nancy's getting ideas<br> above her station.<br> Seems the master told her...<br> that her mistress might be going away<br> for quite a long time...<br> and that he wanted her to stay<br> and look after him.<br> The master told her<br> her mistress might be going away?<br> That's right, sir.<br> - A long time, you said?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> What do you think that means?<br> From all you've told me these last weeks,<br> I should say it could mean...<br> any one of a number<br> of quite unpleasant things.<br> - I've got to get into that house tonight.<br> - Not while he's there.<br> - He goes out every evening?<br> - Right, sir.<br> Tonight after dinner.<br> Nancy says he's told her<br> not to let her mistress see anyone.<br> Then you'll have to see<br> that Nancy isn't home tonight.<br> - Any little thing I can do for the Yard, sir.<br> - I thought you wouldn't mind.<br> There's just one thing more though.<br> How do you know the lady herself<br> will see you?<br> I don't know.<br> Yes.<br> I think there's a way.<br> "People who go every night<br> to places of public amusement...<br> "can hardly enter into..."<br> Your mother was mad.<br> "People who go every night<br> to places of public amusement...<br> "can hardly enter<br> into the fresh gala feeling...<br> "with which an opera or a concert..."<br> She died in an asylum with no brain at all.<br> "The snug comfort of the close carriage...<br> "...the pleasure of setting out<br> with companions...<br> "...the sight of the stars glinting fitfully<br> through the trees..."<br> I'm sorry, sir,<br> but the mistress won't see anyone.<br> Did she tell you to say that?<br> You're Elizabeth, aren't you?<br> - How'd you know my name?<br> - I know many things about this house.<br> You're fond of her, aren't you?<br> You'd like to help her, wouldn't you?<br> This is your chance because I'm a friend,<br> and you're going to let me see her.<br> No. I don't dare, sir. I'd lose me place.<br> Really, I don't dare...<br> - My husband isn't here.<br> - I know that, Mrs. Anton.<br> It's you I want to see.<br> Go away. I'm ill. I can't see anyone.<br> Elizabeth, stop him.<br> I didn't ask him to come.<br> Mrs. Anton, my name is Brian Cameron.<br> You mustn't come here. Go away.<br> Not until I've given you this.<br> Look at it, please.<br> Alice Alquist gave it to me<br> years ago at Covent Garden.<br> I was a little boy<br> overcome with admiration.<br> Now you'll trust me, won't you?<br> You.<br> She gave it to you.<br> After all these years...<br> the great admirer she used to make<br> such a mystery of. A little boy.<br> Tell me something, Mrs. Anton.<br> Are you planning<br> on going away somewhere?<br> Go away? Why, no. I have nowhere to go.<br> Unless my husband sends me away.<br> Is that why you came here?<br> To take me away?<br> Are you as frightened as all that?<br> I'm sorry. I haven't talked to anyone<br> for a long time.<br> I can't talk to you, either. I'm not...<br> I'm afraid I...<br> You're afraid<br> you're going out of your mind.<br> I'm here to prove to you that you're not.<br> To help me do that, you've got to answer<br> my questions. Tell me now...<br> where is your husband now?<br> Where has he gone?<br> He has taken a studio<br> where he can work on his composing.<br> He can't work in this house.<br> He has to have it quiet.<br> Tell me, is there anyone else<br> in the house now except us and Elizabeth?<br> - No. Why?<br> - The gas just went down.<br> - You saw that, too?<br> - Why, yes.<br> Then it really happens.<br> I thought I imagined it.<br> That only means<br> that someone else has turned it on.<br> I thought that, too, but every night,<br> I've been all over the house...<br> and there's never been<br> another light turned on.<br> At last I can tell this to someone.<br> Every night when my husband goes out...<br> The light goes down?<br> - Yes.<br> - And then what?<br> Then I think I hear things.<br> I watch and wait.<br> - Later on, the gas goes up again.<br> - And he comes back.<br> Yes. Quite soon after.<br> Always quite soon after.<br> You say you think you hear things.<br> What things?<br> Sounds. Noises over my room.<br> - What's up there?<br> - A whole floor of trunks and furniture.<br> - Is that what you meant?<br> - Yes!<br> But who?<br> Mrs. Anton, you know, don't you?<br> - You know who's up there.<br> - No.<br> - Are you sure you don't?<br> - No.<br> - How could he be?<br> - There's an alley behind these houses.<br> He goes in the back of Number 5,<br> that's the empty one...<br> and then across the roof.<br> Why?<br> - You said there's old furniture up there.<br> - My aunt's.<br> And her clothes, stage costumes, trunks,<br> all of her things.<br> All of her things?<br> And they said the case was dead.<br> Tell me, has he any weapons in the house?<br> - He has a revolver. Why shouldn't he?<br> - Do you know where he keeps it?<br> I think he has it in his desk in there.<br> You can't open his desk.<br> No. You have no right to.<br> Whoever you are, you have no right to!<br> He'll know. He'll think that I...<br> What should I say to him?<br> You won't have to say anything.<br> Perhaps it's a good thing I came tonight.<br> I was right.<br> There was a letter.<br> - And it was from Sergis Bauer.<br> - What was that?<br> - What was that name you said?<br> - Sergis Bauer.<br> I found this, but my husband said<br> I dreamed, and now it's here.<br> - Bauer.<br> - It's been here the whole time.<br> There was a Sergis Bauer<br> connected with Alice Alquist.<br> He was a young pianist who played<br> for her in Prague. Let me see that.<br> "Dear Miss Alquist,<br> I beg of you to see me just once.<br> "I followed you to London."<br> Look.<br> "Dear Lady Dalroy..."<br> This is my husband's writing.<br> So is this.<br> Your husband and Sergis Bauer<br> are one and the same person.<br> This letter from him to Alice Alquist<br> was written two days before her murder.<br> He said there was no letter,<br> that I was going out of my mind!<br> No. You're slowly and systematically<br> being driven out of your mind.<br> Why?<br> Perhaps because you found this letter<br> and know too much.<br> Or because then he would have control<br> of your property, of this house...<br> and could search in the open<br> instead of the dark like this.<br> Search? What is there to search for?<br> For the things for which<br> Alice Alquist was murdered: Her jewels.<br> I have her jewels.<br> They're the jewels<br> you didn't know she had. Famous jewels.<br> Jewels for which<br> he was searching that night...<br> when he was frightened away by hearing<br> someone come down the stairs.<br> Someone he never saw.<br> A little girl.<br> Me.<br> So he was here that night, but he never...<br> He never knew her.<br> You're wrong. You're making a mistake.<br> I know him. He's my husband.<br> I've lived in the same house with him.<br> You're talking about the man<br> I'm married to.<br> Mrs. Anton, there's not a detail<br> of the Alquist case that I don't know...<br> and unless I'm more mistaken<br> than I've ever been in my life...<br> the man called Sergis Bauer<br> has a wife living in Prague now.<br> So you see, he must have planned<br> the whole thing...<br> step by step from that night.<br> If that were true, then from the beginning<br> there would have been nothing.<br> Nothing real, from the beginning.<br> I'm sorry to take everything away<br> from you like this.<br> - No.<br> - But you must believe me.<br> Your life depends<br> on what you're going to do now.<br> Nothing less than your whole life.<br> Don't you see the way everything fits in?<br> The gas.<br> How long has it been up?<br> Elizabeth, whatever happens tonight,<br> have her welfare in mind.<br> You can count on me, sir.<br> But what am I going to say to the master<br> when he comes back?<br> He won't come back anymore, Elizabeth.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - I was lying down.<br> Fully dressed?<br> - Did you hear what I said?<br> - Yes.<br> Then why don't you answer?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You don't know?<br> Do you know anything<br> about anything you do?<br> I will be obliged if you will come with me<br> to my room.<br> Sit down in this chair.<br> You know what you remind me of<br> as you walk across the room?<br> Have you ever seen anyone<br> walking in their sleep?<br> But you're not asleep.<br> No, you can't deceive me.<br> You're fully awake, or you would not have<br> broken open my desk!<br> Now be careful how you answer.<br> Why did you open my desk?<br> I didn't open your desk.<br> - Nancy?<br> - Nancy's out.<br> - Who, then? Elizabeth?<br> - No, it wasn't Elizabeth.<br> Please don't question me anymore.<br> Let me go back...<br> No. Stay there, Paula.<br> - Why did you open my desk?<br> - I didn't open your desk.<br> - Why did you open my desk?<br> - I didn't open your desk. It was he...<br> He opened it.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Who is he?<br> A man.<br> A man who came to see me.<br> - When?<br> - While you were out.<br> Who let him in?<br> Yes, sir?<br> Who was the man who came to see<br> your mistress while I was out?<br> What man, sir?<br> Come, Elizabeth.<br> You must have answered the bell.<br> No one was here, sir, while you were out.<br> But, Elizabeth...<br> But you saw him.<br> You opened the door for him yourself.<br> Elizabeth, say it!<br> No, ma'am. I didn't see anyone at all.<br> But he was here. I know it.<br> I know it.<br> But he was here. I know it!<br> I saw him.<br> You see how it is, Elizabeth?<br> Yes, sir. I see just how it is.<br> I couldn't have dreamed it.<br> No, I couldn't have dreamed it.<br> Did I dream? Did I really dream?<br> Yes, Paula, you dreamed it.<br> You dreamed all day long.<br> - Are you telling me that I've dreamed...<br> - Everything.<br> - All that happened?<br> - All that did not happen.<br> Then it's true.<br> - My mind is going.<br> - Haven't I told you?<br> - It was a dream.<br> - Like all the rest.<br> - Take me away. I can't fight it anymore.<br> - I will.<br> It was a dream. Take me away.<br> Was I any part of this curious dream<br> of yours, Mrs. Anton?<br> You.<br> Perhaps my presence here<br> might help you to recall it.<br> Who the devil are you?<br> Apparently a mere figment<br> of your wife's imagination.<br> - How did you get into this house?<br> - Through the skylight, like you...<br> and down these stairs.<br> You made it very easy.<br> Will you tell me what you're doing here?<br> Mrs. Anton, I think you'd better<br> go to bed. You must be tired.<br> You'd better explain your business, sir.<br> As a mere figment, as a mere ghost<br> existing in your wife's mind...<br> I could hardly be said<br> to have any business.<br> Paula, go to your room, please.<br> So you found them after all.<br> I was right about you.<br> I knew from the moment I saw you<br> that you were dangerous to me.<br> I knew from the first moment I saw you<br> that you were dangerous to her.<br> I should have followed my instinct<br> about you, as you followed yours.<br> I thought she was Alice Alquist<br> come back to life.<br> I didn't know then that she was walking<br> with Sergis Bauer.<br> - I'm afraid I don't know your name.<br> - Cameron. Want my address, too?<br> - No. I think I can guess it.<br> - So we both ended our search tonight.<br> This is where Alice Alquist hid them.<br> Where the world could see them,<br> yet no one would know where they were...<br> except the man who gave them to her,<br> watching from the royal box.<br> Pretty clever of her to put four priceless<br> jewels among a lot of paste and tape.<br> - For the last time, what do you want?<br> - The jewels, and justice.<br> How does it feel, Bauer, to have planned<br> and killed and tortured for something...<br> - and then to know it's been for nothing?<br> - For nothing?<br> - What is it, ma'am?<br> - I thought I heard a shot.<br> Help! Mr. Williams, come quick!<br> Up there!<br> Anybody at home?<br> Well, Mrs. Anton, you believe me now.<br> Perhaps you'd like to see these things.<br> They cost a woman's life.<br> They cost you something, too.<br> - I want to speak to my husband.<br> - Mrs. Anton, I don't think that's advisable.<br> - I want to speak to him alone.<br> - I'm afraid that's impossible.<br> - I assure you, I'm quite helpless.<br> - Please.<br> I'll be waiting on the stairs.<br> Go and see if he's listening.<br> - He is not listening.<br> - You have got confidence in him.<br> - Did he tell you a lot of things about me?<br> - Yes.<br> - They were lies.<br> - Why should he lie to me?<br> Because he's in love with you.<br> I can tell. I feel it.<br> Do you? Do you really, Gregory?<br> Or shall I call you Sergis?<br> So he told you that, too. What of it?<br> Have you never heard of an artist<br> taking a stage name? Sergis Bauer's mine.<br> It was a part of my life I didn't care to tell<br> you about. I was a failure then.<br> - They don't hang a man for that, do they?<br> - No, they don't hang a man for that.<br> You remember our first days.<br> You remember Italy?<br> There have been times<br> when I thought I only dreamed those days.<br> Come closer, Paula.<br> Closer.<br> Look into my eyes.<br> If I ever meant anything to you,<br> and I believe I did...<br> then help me, Paula.<br> Give me another chance.<br> Look, in the drawer of that cupboard<br> there is a knife.<br> Get it and cut me free.<br> Be quick, Paula.<br> Get me the knife. Cut me free.<br> Would you get it, Paula?<br> Would you get it for me?<br> Yes, I'll get it. I'll get it for you.<br> Hurry, Paula.<br> - There's no knife here.<br> - Yes. I put it there.<br> - I don't see any knife.<br> - I put it there tonight.<br> No, it isn't here.<br> You must have dreamed you put it there.<br> Are you suggesting that this is a knife<br> I hold in my hand?<br> Have you gone mad, my husband?<br> Or is it I who am mad?<br> Yes, of course. That's it.<br> I am mad.<br> I'm always losing things and hiding things.<br> I can never find them.<br> I don't know where I put them.<br> That was a knife, wasn't it?<br> And I have lost it.<br> - Paula...<br> - I must look for it, mustn't I?<br> If I don't find it,<br> you will put me in the madhouse.<br> Where could it be, now?<br> Perhaps it's behind this picture.<br> Yes, it must be here.<br> No. Where shall I look now?<br> Perhaps I put it over here.<br> Yes, I must have done that.<br> My broach. The broach I lost at the Tower.<br> I found it at last!<br> You see? But it doesn't help you, does it?<br> And I'm trying to help you to escape,<br> aren't I?<br> - How can a madwoman help you escape?<br> - But you're not mad.<br> Yes, I am mad, as my mother was!<br> No, Paula. That wasn't true! Help me.<br> If I were not mad, I could have helped you.<br> Whatever you had done,<br> I could have pitied and protected you.<br> But because I am mad, I hate you.<br> Because I am mad, I have betrayed you,<br> and because I am mad...<br> I am rejoicing in my heart<br> without a shred of pity...<br> without a shred of regret,<br> watching you go with glory in my heart!<br> Mr. Cameron, come.<br> Come, Mr. Cameron. Take this man away!<br> Take this man away!<br> - You ready?<br> - Quite ready.<br> I don't ask you to understand me.<br> Between us all the time<br> were those jewels, like a fire.<br> A fire in my brain that separated us...<br> Those jewels which I wanted all my life.<br> I don't know why.<br> The cab is coming, Mr. Cameron.<br> Goodbye, Paula.<br> Goodbye, Gregory.<br> This night will be a long night.<br> But it will end. It's starting to clear.<br> In the morning, when the sun rises...<br> sometimes it's hard to believe<br> there ever was a night.<br> You'll find that, too.<br> Let me come and see you and talk to you.<br> Perhaps I can help somehow.<br> You're very kind.<br> Well!<br>
