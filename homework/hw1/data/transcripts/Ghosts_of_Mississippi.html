Daddy!<br> Daddy, I love you!<br> Daddy, don't die!<br> I want my daddy!<br> Turn me loose.<br> Turn me loose.<br> Medgar Evers believed in this country.<br> It now remains to be seen<br> whether his country believed in him.<br> The Citizens Council's raised<br> thousands for your defense.<br> Money's pouring in<br> from all over the South.<br> Nice likeness.<br> What do you think, boys?<br> Mr. Beckwith, glad to see you.<br> Mighty glad to be here.<br> And isn't it true<br> your husband was the first...<br> ...to attempt to integrate<br> the University of Mississippi?<br> At the time of his death,<br> he was involved in a lawsuit...<br> ...to integrate the public<br> school system, wasn't he?<br> Your husband must've had quite<br> a few enemies, would you agree?<br> Yes, he did.<br> Your eldest boy,<br> his name is Kenyatta, isn't it?<br> Darrell Kenyatta Evers.<br> Kenyatta's a Mau Mau name, isn't it?<br> Objection.<br> Sustained.<br> Isn't it true that over 100 people<br> were arrested during a demonstration...<br> ...that your husband<br> organized boycotting...<br> ...a department store in downtown<br> Jackson known as Kennington's?<br> Who's that?<br> Ross Barnett.<br> You're kidding.<br> Nope. You don't see that<br> every day of the week.<br> A former governor shaking hands<br> with an assassin in front of the jury.<br> There's not a court in America<br> that would stand for that.<br> What's America got to do<br> with anything?<br> This is Mississippi.<br> Byron De La Beckwith.<br> -You live in Greenwood, Mississippi?<br> -Y es, sir.<br> My mother was a Yerger.<br> Her mother was Susan Yerger...<br> ...a close personal friend<br> of Mrs. Jefferson Davis.<br> You shoot Medgar Evers?<br> No, sir!<br> Your Honor, may l?<br> Mr. Beckwith, is this your rifle?<br> Let's see.<br> Well, it bears a similarity...<br> ...but I couldn't say for certain.<br> I don't record the<br> serial numbers of my weapons...<br> ...and my gun was stolen<br> from my home several days before...<br> ...this whole business.<br> How do you feel, Delay?<br> I got tears in my eyes.<br> For Dixie, huh?<br> In summation...<br> ...not only did surveillance cameras<br> provide us with a visual record...<br> ...of the crime being committed...<br> ...but four eyewitnesses observed<br> the defendant removing his mask...<br> ...upon exiting the convenience store.<br> Short of you ladies and gentlemen<br> attending the actual event...<br> ...we don't feel the state<br> could have a stronger case.<br> Thank you.<br> Counsel?<br> Hey, Bobby. How'd it go?<br> Through a combination<br> of superior lawyering...<br> ...and a less than stellar performance<br> by our criminal, I got a conviction.<br> Congratulations.<br> My rape victim's reluctant to testify.<br> Can you handle the Harrison motion?<br> -You bet.<br> -You're a lifesaver.<br> -DeLaughter, your wife just called.<br> -What'd she want?<br> To remind you you're having lunch with<br> her mother and your parents at 1:00.<br> How could I forget?<br> Bobby.<br> -You seen this?<br> -Yes, I have.<br> Evers' widow is calling for<br> the re-prosecution of De La Beckwith.<br> Ed, this guy was killed<br> over 25 years ago.<br> Dig up whatever you can on Medgar Evers<br> and be in my office at 3:00.<br> Ed, this is ridiculous.<br> Well, sure it is.<br> But if we try to bury this...<br> ...she'll have every black politician<br> climbing all over me.<br> My office, 3:00.<br> Do we have any files here<br> on Medgar Evers?<br> Who?<br> The civil rights leader<br> that got himself shot in the 1960s?<br> I just saw that file. It was next<br> to the one on the Lindbergh baby.<br> Clara, just bring me what we have.<br> Good afternoon, sir.<br> Did you make Hinds County safer today?<br> You know how it is with criminals.<br> It's like finding a gray hair.<br> You pull one and two more pop up<br> to take its place.<br> I love those earrings.<br> Have you worn them before?<br> I've had them for quite some time.<br> I just never wear them during the day.<br> You see that nonsense<br> about the Sovereignty Commission?<br> Yeah, isn't that awful?<br> That fool, Rea Hederman.<br> Since he took over that paper...<br> ...Iiberals like Jerry Mitchell<br> been trying to rewrite history.<br> The Sovereignty Commission was a fine<br> organization that did a lot of good.<br> Dixie, would you pass me the butter?<br> Why do they dig up things<br> that happened 25 years ago anyway?<br> Medgar Evers' widow<br> wants to reopen the case.<br> You can't be serious.<br> Ed asked me to look into it.<br> You just tell him, "No, thank you."<br> When will these people get it through<br> their heads that the '60s are over?<br> The 1860s and the 1960s.<br> I thought they found<br> that Beckwith fella not guilty.<br> Actually, there were two hung juries.<br> The reason I know is because<br> my late husband, Judge Moore...<br> ...was a spectator<br> at both those trials.<br> He'd never miss a day.<br> And he told me...<br> ...that they'd never convict Beckwith,<br> no matter how many trials they had.<br> It's just political. I don't<br> think anything will come of it.<br> Son, for your sake,<br> it had better not.<br> You want to be a judge someday.<br> You persecute a 70-year-old man,<br> guilty or not, over some nigger...<br> ...you'll have everybody in Mississippi<br> lined up against you.<br> -Hey, Howard.<br> -How you doing?<br> Y'all got any<br> of that crawdad chowder today?<br> Yes, sir.<br> -How many for crawdad chowder?<br> -Oh, come on!<br> Mrs. Evers, Mr. Dees, I'm Jerry Mitchell<br> from The Clarion-Ledger.<br> I broke the story on the jury<br> tampering in your husband's case.<br> -I talked to you on the phone.<br> -That's right.<br> Thank you for your good work. I can't<br> tell you how much it's appreciated.<br> I'm just doing my job, ma'am.<br> What do you think your chances are<br> of getting the D.A. to reopen the case?<br> I've passed this way before.<br> Let's just say I've adopted<br> an attitude of tempered optimism.<br> DeLaughter, hear the news?<br> President Lincoln just got shot.<br> Some guy named Booth did it.<br> The Sovereignty Commission, a state<br> agency, worked against the D.A...<br> ...to ensure the jury had Beckwith<br> sympathizers to keep him out of jail.<br> That's grounds for a new trial.<br> With all due respect...<br> ...those old files have been<br> leaking out for years.<br> They only ran background checks which,<br> while unethical, was not illegal.<br> We can't prove jury tampering.<br> I'd like you to meet Bob DeLaughter.<br> How do you do?<br> -Pleasure.<br> -Mr. Morris Dees...<br> ...the Southern Poverty Law Center.<br> -How you doing?<br> -I was explaining...<br> ...that in order for us<br> to pursue this...<br> ...we'll need more<br> than an article in a newspaper.<br> We'll need new evidence.<br> In 1964, you had<br> a mountain of evidence.<br> All you gotta do is retry Beckwith.<br> On the basis of that alone,<br> you'll get a conviction.<br> As you can see, the mountain<br> has crumbled a bit.<br> What's this?<br> That's all that's left of the<br> state's case against De La Beckwith.<br> Just a few pages<br> of the old police report.<br> -Where's the gun? Where--<br> -Where's the bullet?<br> Where's the original trial transcript?<br> Where are the files? Beats me.<br> Are you telling us it is lost?<br> I'm telling you, we don't have it.<br> Well, that's outrageous.<br> Even if we had the evidence,<br> we'd never get around...<br> ...to the Sixth Amendment right<br> to a speedy trial.<br> Mr. Dees would agree that 25 years<br> isn't exactly what you'd call speedy.<br> May I see that?<br> Mrs. Evers, this is<br> pretty strong stuff.<br> I'd like to see it.<br> "June 13, 1963.<br> To the Jackson Police Department:<br> When you catch whoever killed<br> the nigger, pin a medal on him...<br> ...because he just did Mississippi<br> one hell of a favor.<br> June 14, 1963.<br> A female who refused<br> to identify herself stated...<br> ...that she'd heard a rumor<br> that Medgar Evers' wife...<br> ...had gotten jealous of Lena Horne,<br> who appeared with Evers at a rally...<br> ...and might have gotten<br> her brother-in-law to kill Evers."<br> Who wouldn't be jealous of Lena Horne?<br> What a beautiful woman.<br> Y es, ma'am.<br> The cops wrote that garbage down<br> because they actually took it seriously.<br> Mr. Dees.<br> Do you think the police in Washington,<br> D.C. would have written it up...<br> ...if some nitwit said Jackie Kennedy<br> had a hand in J.F.K.'s death...<br> ...because her husband ran around<br> with Marilyn Monroe?<br> What's your point?<br> The murder of Medgar Evers<br> was a race crime...<br> ...a political crime.<br> An assassination.<br> Beckwith is free today...<br> ...thanks to a racist jury,<br> a racist police department...<br> ...and a racist D.A.'s office.<br> Twenty-five years ago,<br> Waller and this office...<br> ...went after Beckwith<br> not once but twice.<br> I don't need to sit here and listen--<br> Twenty-five years ago,<br> I sat on the witness stand...<br> ...and I watched as the former<br> governor of this state...<br> ...shook hands with the man<br> who murdered my husband...<br> ...while I was on the stand.<br> I don't expect you to understand...<br> ...the pain and suffering<br> my family went through...<br> ...but I did come here thinking...<br> ...that this office might want<br> to see justice finally served.<br> You've given me all the reasons<br> why you can't pursue this.<br> Perhaps you can find<br> one reason why you can.<br> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<br> Ed Peters is a good man...<br> ...but as you can see,<br> we simply don't have a case.<br> I know you've been living<br> with this thing for a long while...<br> ...but maybe it's just time you....<br> Let it go?<br> I can understand why you'd<br> think that, Mr. DeLaughter.<br> For years, I said<br> the same thing to Medgar.<br> "Let it go.<br> Let's get out of Mississippi."<br> Do you know what he said to me?<br> " I don't know if I'm going<br> to heaven or to hell...<br> ...but I'm going from Jackson."<br> Good afternoon, Mr. DeLaughter.<br> Hey, everybody, I'm home.<br> Hey, tiger.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> You sure you got enough distractions?<br> I can go get your Game Boy.<br> Dad.<br> Hi, Daddy.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> -Did you bring me a lollipop?<br> -I did. I got one for Claire too.<br> -Thanks, Daddy.<br> -How was school today, sweetie?<br> Did Miss Collins like<br> the bracelet you made?<br> Daddy, tell us a story.<br> -A real scary one.<br> -Claire, you want to hear a story?<br> Okay, but not too scary.<br> Let's go to Mommy and Daddy's room,<br> because we don't wanna disturb Burt.<br> -You want something to eat?<br> -No, I got something at the office.<br> Thanks for letting me know.<br> Honey, what are you doing up?<br> I can't sleep.<br> The ghost is back.<br> I'll go. I'll go.<br> The ghost is back?<br> Where is he this time?<br> In my bed.<br> Really? We'll just have<br> to see about that.<br> You were right.<br> He's right there on the bed.<br> No, Daddy.<br> Now he's over by the window.<br> I see.<br> Your bottle tree was<br> supposed to keep him away.<br> Maybe I don't have<br> the right kind of bottles.<br> You know, baby...<br> ...when we lived in Natchez,<br> there was a ghost...<br> ...that lived right next door...<br> ...in the remains of this house<br> that got burned during the war.<br> And sometimes he'd come over<br> and get right in my closet.<br> How'd you make him go away?<br> Granny would come in<br> and sing a song...<br> ...and before you knew it,<br> he was gone.<br> What'd she sing?<br> She sang the song every ghost<br> from Mississippi loves.<br> Sing it, Daddy.<br> All right.<br> I wish I was in the land of cotton<br> Old times there are not forgotten<br> Look away<br> Look away<br> Look away, Dixieland<br> In Dixieland where I was born<br> Early on one frosty morn'<br> Look away, look away<br> Look away, Dixieland<br> Oh, I wish I was in Dixie<br> Hooray, hooray<br> In Dixieland I'll take my stand<br> To live and die in Dixie<br> Away, away<br> Away down South<br> In Dixie<br> I'd ask what's new,<br> but I'm afraid you'd tell me.<br> My readers are on the edge<br> of their collective seat.<br> Will Mr. DeLaughter go after<br> Byron De La Beckwith?<br> The D.A.'s office will investigate<br> the possibility of reopening the case.<br> I didn't go to law school,<br> but that sounds like bullshit.<br> Nice talking to you.<br> Have a nice day.<br> Can you tell me how I can get<br> ahold of Lewis Skinner...<br> ...or Fred Sanders?<br> If you want Lewis Skinner, you'll need<br> a shovel and six hours of digging time.<br> What's Fred's status?<br> As far as I know,<br> he's still aboveground.<br> Back in '63,<br> none of those houses were there.<br> That was all vacant lot.<br> And this here was<br> all covered over with brush.<br> I got out here eight minutes<br> after the call came in.<br> The way Mrs. Evers yelled at me,<br> you'd think I was the one who done it.<br> This is where they found the gun,<br> hidden in some honeysuckle vines.<br> Any idea where<br> that gun might be today?<br> Hell, no.<br> Back in those days...<br> ...evidence had a habit<br> of disappearing after the trials.<br> Look at that.<br> My grandmother could have<br> picked Evers off from over here.<br> That's where he was shot.<br> That big tree wasn't there<br> at the time.<br> There was blood everywhere.<br> All over the driveway,<br> all over the car.<br> It was as if somebody<br> had butchered a hog.<br> But Evers must've been one hell of a<br> strong man because somehow he managed...<br> ...to drag himself<br> all the way up to his door.<br> After that bullet tore through his back,<br> it slammed through that window...<br> ...crashed through a wall...<br> ...ricocheted off the refrigerator<br> and busted the coffeepot.<br> We found it on the kitchen counter<br> next to a watermelon.<br> You're kidding me.<br> No, sir.<br> Did he have any kids?<br> If my memory serves, I believe there<br> were three little ones there that night.<br> What kind of man shoots another man<br> in the back in front of his family?<br> I love the land of my birth.<br> I do not mean<br> just America as a country...<br> ...but Mississippi...<br> ... the state in which I was born.<br> So the deplorable things<br> I speak of here today...<br> ... will be said to you<br> in hopes of a future...<br> ... where such will not<br> be the case in Mississippi.<br> In the horrific deaths...<br> ...of Emmett Till...<br> ...Reverend G. W. Lee...<br> ...Lamar Smith and a variety<br> of other atrocities...<br> ...no one has been convicted.<br> And we feel those guilty of having<br> committed these ungodly acts...<br> ...had the feeling of assurance<br> that nothing ever would be done.<br> For you see, ladies and gentlemen...<br> ... white juries have yet to convict<br> a white man in Mississippi...<br> ...guilty of a crime against a Negro.<br> The failure of the so-called decent<br> or moderate white person...<br> ... to take a positive<br> and uncompromising stand....<br> Who's that?<br> Medgar Evers.<br> Why are you looking at it?<br> I just wanted to get<br> an idea of who he was.<br> I'd like to get<br> an idea of who you are.<br> What's that supposed to mean?<br> I was willing to go down<br> that road with you...<br> ...when you got out of law school<br> and did that pro bono work.<br> And when you worked for<br> that Jew lawyer who ran you ragged.<br> I minded a little when you turned down<br> that offer from Morse & Braggs...<br> ...so you could be assistant D.A.<br> at one-fourth the salary.<br> But I'll be damned if I spent<br> ...just so you can humiliate me.<br> You're gonna pursue this, aren't you?<br> You're gonna humiliate me<br> in front of my friends...<br> ...my family and the entire state.<br> I'm just looking<br> at a couple of tapes.<br> Fine. Look at your tapes.<br> That's all you'd better do.<br> -Why not?<br> -Because you can't win.<br> Who says?<br> -The Sixth Amendment.<br> -Suppose I could get around it.<br> It's one thing for<br> the grieving widow to carry on--<br> Suppose an argument could be made<br> that the Sixth Amendment doesn't apply.<br> You want to retry Beckwith?<br> Fine.<br> Dig up 26-year-old physical evidence<br> which probably no longer exists...<br> ...identify it, and then you'll have<br> to locate the key witnesses...<br> ...who, if you find them,<br> are probably dead or senile.<br> Their testimony could be read<br> from the transcript.<br> We haven't seen a certified<br> transcript in over 25 years.<br> -What if I found one?<br> -Let's say, by some miracle...<br> ...you found one, got an indictment.<br> Then by some greater miracle...<br> ...the state Supreme Court and U.S.<br> Supreme Court didn't throw it out...<br> ...and you actually got to trial.<br> What if you lose?<br> The whole state, which is supposed<br> to have changed so much...<br> ...will be facing the worst<br> public relations disaster...<br> ...since that black kid, Emmett Till,<br> bobbed up out of the river.<br> Are you telling me<br> I can't go after this?<br> I'm telling you<br> you're dealing with the past.<br> Mississippi's not<br> a place you wanna be.<br> Hopefully, Jerry Mitchell can<br> keep this thing alive for us.<br> Jerry Mitchell's fine, but<br> what we need is national press.<br> Darrell, CNN won't run a major story<br> about how the D.A. of Hinds County...<br> ...is refusing to re-prosecute a case...<br> ...that's a quarter of a century old.<br> Stop annoying your grandmama.<br> The greatest joy in your mother's life<br> is being annoyed by her grandchildren.<br> Next to being annoyed by you, Walter.<br> I'll get it.<br> I'm not here no matter who it is.<br> Who?<br> Just a minute, please.<br> I want you to eat those beans.<br> It's long distance from Jackson.<br> A man by the name of DeLaughter.<br> You want me to take it?<br> No, I'll take it.<br> Eat those beans.<br> I don't eat beans.<br> Hello, Mrs. Evers.<br> I know you probably left here<br> feeling pretty discouraged...<br> ...but I hope you understand<br> Mr. Peters was just being realistic.<br> I understand perfectly.<br> I also wanted you to know...<br> ...that we are going to<br> be keeping this case open.<br> Mrs. Evers?<br> Did it suddenly occur to<br> Mr. Peters that he'd better...<br> ...start making nice with the<br> black community before November?<br> -Mrs. Evers--<br> -He made it clear to me...<br> ...that in addition to having<br> no evidence and no witnesses...<br> ...he also had no interest.<br> Looking into this wasn't so much<br> Mr. Peter's idea as it was mine.<br> -Yours?<br> -Yes, ma'am.<br> Judge Russel Moore was perhaps<br> the most racist judge...<br> ...in the history<br> of the state of Mississippi.<br> Why would his son-in-law<br> be interested in this case?<br> Mrs. Evers, I'm 37 years old,<br> just like Medgar was...<br> ...and I've got three kids,<br> like he did.<br> I was 11 years old<br> when your husband was killed...<br> ...and I hardly remember him at all.<br> But I went by your house the other day<br> and I could see him there...<br> ...watering his lawn...<br> ... working on his roof...<br> ...playing with his children.<br> No man has the right to take<br> another man away from his children.<br> I appreciate the call,<br> Mr. DeLaughter.<br> I'll keep in touch, Mrs. Evers.<br> Did you plan on telling me...<br> ...or was I just gonna read<br> about it in the papers?<br> We should be at the<br> Walkers' house in 15 minutes.<br> Well, I've got a lot<br> of work to do here.<br> Suit yourself.<br> Nobody gives a goddamn<br> what Byron De La Beckwith did...<br> ...to some Medgar Evers 26 years ago.<br> Hell, Larry Smith got shot down<br> in his own driveway just last week.<br> And it wasn't for no civil rights.<br> It was for his spare change.<br> I could have had any investigator<br> I wanted, and I asked for you.<br> Am I meant to be flattered by that?<br> We're supposed to nail Eddie Williams<br> for killing Wendell Washington...<br> ...or that guy Pierson<br> for shooting Donny Brown.<br> That's why we're only gonna work<br> on this case in our spare time.<br> Holy shit.<br> Will you look at this?<br> You could buy a whole damn General<br> Electric refrigerator for $185.<br> T alk about your good old days.<br> That's my daddy.<br> I didn't know he was on the force too.<br> Sure. Detective L.C. Bennett.<br> He was there when they found Beckwith's<br> rifle, but I've never seen this.<br> John Goza is dead.<br> Herbert Speight is dead.<br> B.L. Pittman is dead.<br> Is anybody alive?<br> This is pointless.<br> It's Jerry Mitchell.<br> Jerry.<br> I don't have the gun yet.<br> I don't have anything. If I find<br> the gun, you'll be the first to know.<br> -Pain in my ass.<br> -It's funny.<br> I came by to see if you could<br> use some help on this case...<br> ...and you've got a picture of my daddy.<br> We sure could use some help.<br> Can you bring people<br> back from the dead?<br> You're joking, but that's<br> exactly what we have to do.<br> We have to make the past<br> start living again.<br> This whole case is one big resurrection.<br> I want you to go through<br> all the literature...<br> ...from every organization<br> Beckwith was part of:<br> White Citizens Council,<br> Sons of the American Revolution, KKK.<br> Good, I always loved homework.<br> We'll start by paying<br> these boys a little visit.<br> -Who's that?<br> -Two cops.<br> They saw Beckwith 90 miles away<br> at the time of the murder.<br> You think Holley and Cresswell<br> will admit they lied under oath?<br> Time has a way of cleaning up<br> people's memories.<br> I love the Delta.<br> It's the best place on earth.<br> If you're a mosquito.<br> -T ake care now.<br> -Thank you, Mr. Holley.<br> Sometimes you can't win for losing.<br> I asked you boys<br> to meet me out here...<br> ...so as to avoid running<br> into any of my constituents.<br> How long have you been<br> an alderman up here, Mr. Holley?<br> Must be going on about five years.<br> I'll tell you this:<br> If word got out that I testified<br> on behalf of Byron De La Beckwith....<br> I suppose, in a way, your boss<br> and me got the same problem.<br> Sir?<br> If we want to keep our jobs...<br> ...we'll have to kiss<br> an awful lot of black behind.<br> Mr. Holley...<br> ...Evers was killed shortly after<br> midnight, 90 miles away in Jackson.<br> There's no way the killer<br> could have been here...<br> ...at 1 a.m. pumping gas.<br> No, sir, that'd be impossible.<br> It was a long while ago, but I'd like<br> you to think back and tell me...<br> ...are you sure about the time...<br> ...you saw Mr. Beckwith<br> at that gas station?<br> This old memory of mine...<br> ...gets worse and worse<br> with each passing year...<br> ...but there's two things<br> I am pretty sure about:<br> It was approximately 1:03<br> in the morning...<br> ...and old Delay was gassing up<br> that Valiant of his.<br> Lying son of a bitch.<br> You thought you'd hear<br> something different?<br> Maybe we'll have better luck<br> with his partner.<br> Y'all wanna subpoena me...<br> ...then you go right ahead and do it.<br> But if I see you,<br> Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...or the blackest nigger<br> in this country...<br> ...putting gas in his car<br> at the time of a murder...<br> ...then that's what I'll say.<br> I'd say he's in our camp.<br> I wish I had better news<br> for her today.<br> Who's that?<br> Mrs. Evers.<br> Fill it up for me, would you, buddy?<br> I call her every Friday and let her<br> know how the case is progressing.<br> Got a flash for you.<br> This case ain't progressing.<br> I think about her keeping<br> this thing alive all this time.<br> Imagine a woman loving a man so much.<br> I can't even get a woman<br> to love me while I'm still alive.<br> Know what I did after my last divorce?<br> I took up golf.<br> Man needs a hobby to occupy his mind,<br> or he'll start doing crazy things...<br> ...Iike drinking too much...<br> ...or chasing 26-year-old murder cases<br> across the Mississippi Delta.<br> I told you I'd call you every Friday.<br> And it's Friday, Mrs. Evers,<br> so I'm calling.<br> This really isn't necessary.<br> It's important to me you know<br> we're doing what we can.<br> I wish I had better news<br> for you today...<br> ...but we still haven't been able<br> to locate the autopsy report.<br> Most of the physical evidence<br> is still missing.<br> A number of the witnesses have died,<br> which really hurts us...<br> ...and we've had no luck finding<br> the original trial transcript.<br> I've just spoke with<br> both Holley and Cresswell...<br> ...and they're sticking<br> by their stories.<br> I'm sure as the assistant<br> district attorney of Hinds County...<br> ...you're doing everything<br> in your power...<br> ...to see that justice is done.<br> I'll call you next Friday.<br> I'll be on pins and needles till then.<br> I waited for you to come home.<br> I'm not taking the children with me.<br> I just need to be<br> on my own for a while.<br> I was just wondering<br> when we stopped loving each other.<br> I don't know.<br> What happened, Bobby?<br> People change.<br> You saying I've changed?<br> I'm saying you haven't.<br> -It's a beautiful area, Mr. Beckwith.<br> -It's heaven on earth.<br> Of course, like everywhere else...<br> ... we do get the occasional<br> stray nigger moving in.<br> But their houses always<br> seem to burn down.<br> You know how careless niggers are<br> with their cigarettes.<br> A real beauty.<br> -Where'd you get this?<br> -Ed Bryson at Channel 3.<br> They're running a piece on Beckwith.<br> Do you think...<br> ...it's a crime for a white man<br> to kill a black man?<br> God put the white man here<br> to rule over all the dusky races.<br> It says so in the Bible.<br> Is there a chance...<br> ... you'd be indicted again<br> for the murder of Medgar Evers?<br> Why would I be?<br> Do you know of any new evidence?<br> -Are you a Jew?<br> -Catholic.<br> I told you, I won't talk to no Jew.<br> Anybody who knows anything<br> about Jews and niggers...<br> ...knows that Jews put the niggers<br> up to all this foolishness.<br> This CORE and SNCC and NAACP.<br> If you were indicted again?<br> Well, I'm just gonna<br> tend to my business...<br> ...Iike I always have.<br> I'm gonna look out<br> for my God, my family...<br> ...and the whole state<br> of Christ's church.<br> That don't encompass anybody<br> but white Christians.<br> All these other...<br> ...races and colors<br> and creeds and sissies...<br> ... they are anti-Christs.<br> See, many of them...<br> ...believe in human sacrifices<br> and voodoo and such.<br> According to your way<br> of thinking...<br> ...how could justice be done<br> in the Medgar Evers murder?<br> First, find out<br> who killed the nigger.<br> Then you just...<br> ...do whatever the law says<br> that you can do...<br> ...if you're big enough to do it.<br> He's daring us to get him.<br> -We still ain't got nothing.<br> -I know what you'll say.<br> -Did I kill Medgar Evers?<br> -Did you?<br> I did not kill him.<br> But he sure is dead.<br> And he ain't coming back.<br> What did you think when<br> you heard he'd been killed?<br> I didn't shed a tear.<br> No, sir.<br> Here.

Is that a fact?<br> It's a fact.<br> I was shocked, and I remember<br> thinking how stupid he was...<br> ...shooting off his mouth<br> like that in front of 100 men.<br> -Did you report that to the FBl?<br> -Sure, I did.<br> But Beckwith was a white man<br> accused of killing a black.<br> The FBl wasn't gonna blow my cover<br> on a case they couldn't win.<br> They were saving me<br> for Neshoba because--<br> Two of the victims were white.<br> Mr. Dennis,<br> if I can't build the case...<br> ...I give you my word that<br> we never had this conversation.<br> But if I can...<br> ...will you testify?<br> Byron De La Beckwith<br> is the craziest...<br> ...most dangerous son of a bitch<br> I ever come across.<br> He's so crazy even<br> the Klan's afraid of him.<br> He's an old man now.<br> That old man is probably more dangerous<br> today than he was 30 years ago.<br> Mr. Dennis, we need your help.<br> I can't make no promises.<br> You know something, Mr. Dennis?<br> Six months I've worked this case.<br> A lot of people have told me<br> to give it up.<br> " It's 27 years old.<br> Let sleeping dogs lie."<br> But I don't see<br> what difference it makes...<br> ...if a man was<br> bushwhacked yesterday...<br> ...today or 27 damn years ago.<br> Murder is murder.<br> It's still my job to bring<br> the son of a bitch to justice.<br> It's still your job to help me.<br> No. I did my job.<br> I testified against the Klan.<br> They shot out my windows,<br> blew up my car.<br> They hunted and harassed me<br> for 25 years!<br> Don't that get me even<br> for the wrong I done?<br> We never get even<br> for the wrong we've done.<br> If I do this thing...<br> ...you gotta promise me protection.<br> What's going on?<br> Stop that.<br> Stop that. IKnock it off.<br> Enough of that!<br> -What's going on?<br> -Eddy called you a nigger lover.<br> My dad says you're after a man<br> for something that isn't even a crime.<br> That's enough fighting, son.<br> You get on home. Go on home.<br> Let me take a look at you.<br> My God. Get in this house.<br> What's gotten into you?<br> All this fighting.<br> All this name-calling.<br> Is this what you want?<br> To drag your children into this?<br> What would you have me do?<br> Let a murderer go free?<br> I'd never tell you your business.<br> I'm thinking about the children.<br> I don't understand why every<br> decent person in this state...<br> ...isn't sickened by what<br> happened here 27 years ago.<br> -Oh, Bobby.<br> -You're not, are you?<br> -Not in front of the children.<br> -Why not?<br> I was just a kid...<br> ...and I still remember you<br> and your friends discussing it.<br> And I recollect someone saying,<br> "That nigger needed to be shot."<br> I never said a hateful<br> thing like that.<br> -You didn't cry, did you?<br> -I can't say that I shed any tears--<br> Had it been our beloved governor,<br> Ross Barnett, got himself shot...<br> ...you would've been<br> bawling your eyes out.<br> Evers left a young widow and three<br> little kids. Why didn't you cry?<br> -I don't wanna discuss this now.<br> -Why?<br> Because he tried to destroy<br> our way of life.<br> And he succeeded all too well.<br> This state's going to hell<br> on account of integration.<br> That's a fact. If you think<br> they appreciate one thing...<br> ...we gave them, you're crazy.<br> -Tiger, how do you feel?<br> -I'm all right.<br> -Your son has one tough nose.<br> -So it's not broken?<br> It'll be tender for a couple days,<br> then it'll be good as new.<br> Thank you. I appreciate it.<br> You're welcome.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Are you the one involved<br> in this Medgar Evers thing?<br> Yes, I am.<br> I think what you're trying to do<br> is very important.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I don't want you kids getting<br> into anymore fights.<br> -But he called you a--<br> -I don't care what he called me.<br> It doesn't bother me. You gotta<br> learn not to let it bother you.<br> A lot of people around here<br> don't like what Daddy's doing now.<br> What are you doing, Daddy?<br> I'm trying to put a bad man in jail.<br> Mama says what you're doing is wrong.<br> Grandma said Edgar Mevers<br> is ruining our life.<br> Medgar Evers was a good guy<br> who tried to help people.<br> Did he try to beat the bad guys?<br> Yes, he did. He fought<br> so that black people...<br> ...could eat in the same restaurants,<br> swim in the same pools...<br> ...shop in the same stores and go<br> to the same schools as white people.<br> What's wrong with that?<br> Nothing.<br> But you'll hear people say<br> all kinds of bad things...<br> ...about what your daddy's doing.<br> They're gonna tease you,<br> try to pick fights.<br> But no matter what they do...<br> ...I want you to walk away.<br> What if they say<br> something really mean?<br> They're only words. They can't<br> hurt you unless you let them.<br> Is this about sticks and stones?<br> That's exactly what this is about.<br> Y'all understand what I'm saying?<br> Yes, sir.<br> All right.<br> All y'all get on to bed now.<br> Good night.<br> I heard you had a little visit<br> with my friend Delmar.<br> Mr. Beckwith?<br> Next time you see old Delmar,<br> you tell him for me...<br> ...there are a lot<br> of dark, winding roads...<br> ... between the backwoods of Louisiana<br> and a courtroom in Mississippi.<br> A man could get lost.<br> Claire, what's the matter?<br> The ghost's in my room again.<br> Let's see what we can do.<br> -Where is he?<br> -Sitting right there.<br> Oh, right.<br> Daddy, sing "Dixie."<br> Hop into bed, sweetie.<br> Sing.<br> You know, sweetie, maybe<br> " Dixie" is not the right song.<br> Maybe that's why<br> this ghost keeps coming back.<br> -But you said--<br> -I know, baby.<br> But I'm not so sure<br> that all ghosts like "Dixie."<br> But how do we know<br> what this ghost likes?<br> Seeing as this is your special ghost,<br> maybe he'll like your favorite song.<br> "Old MacDonald"?<br> Let's give it a try.<br> Old MacDonald had a farm<br> E-I-E-I-O<br> And on that farm he had a--<br> What?<br> A ghost?<br> And on that farm he had a ghost<br> E-I-E-I-O<br> With a boo boo here<br> And a boo boo there<br> Here a boo, there a boo<br> Everywhere a boo boo<br> You wanted to have lunch<br> to talk about Burt's nose?<br> No, actually, l....<br> I didn't think so.<br> So then, this is a date?<br> Apparently.<br> In the hospital cafeteria?<br> I took a chance. I thought<br> it would either be stupid or charming.<br> What do you think?<br> Is there a third choice?<br> Extremely charming?<br> That's the one.<br> How'd you get into all this?<br> You want the standard answer<br> or the truth?<br> How about a little of both?<br> I always liked helping people...<br> ...and I like the hours.<br> Which answer was that?<br> A little of both.<br> But I do like that I work<br> one week on and one week off.<br> Can't beat that.<br> Have to be careful not to shop<br> too much in that week off.<br> That can kill you.<br> What about you?<br> I wanted to be a lawyer<br> since I was a little kid.<br> I watched Perry Mason...<br> ...all the time.<br> I identified with him.<br> -But he was a defense attorney.<br> -I know.<br> Later, I realized the only way<br> he ever won a case...<br> ...is if some guy jumped up<br> and yelled, "I did it!"<br> That didn't happen often,<br> so I switched to the other side.<br> I think it's a good thing you did.<br> You would be in<br> the minority these days.<br> There are a lot more people<br> on your side than you think.<br> You're not saying that because<br> I bought you a lime Jell-O?<br> Well, it is the way<br> to a woman's heart.<br> But if you could pull this off,<br> it'd do Mississippi a whole lot of good.<br> And if I don't?<br> I'll pretend I never met you.<br> I have renewed faith<br> in the institution of marriage.<br> I can't get enough<br> of my hunk of burning love.<br> Not now, Clara May!<br> Clara Mayfield.<br> -It's Jerry Mitchell.<br> -I'll take it.<br> -I know you have the gun.<br> -We've been over this.<br> I know you found it<br> in Russel Moore's den.<br> There'll be a story about how the<br> D.A. Iied to the people of Jackson...<br> ...and how Bobby DeLaughter<br> lied to Myrlie Evers.<br> I'm calling to see<br> if you care to comment.<br> You've explained why<br> you lied to the press.<br> You still have not explained<br> why you lied to me.<br> I told you. Jerry Mitchell<br> is a loose cannon.<br> This case was so delicate,<br> I didn't want to take chances.<br> I'm the last person on earth who<br> would jeopardize this investigation.<br> There's something<br> you're not telling me.<br> I swear to God, there is no cover-up.<br> You fully intend to seek<br> an indictment and a new trial?<br> That's what we've<br> been working toward.<br> I thought so, Mr. DeLaughter.<br> I thought so.<br> This latest revelation only proves<br> what we've suspected all along.<br> Peters and DeLaughter are just putting<br> on a show for the black community.<br> As far as I'm concerned, they're nothing<br> but a pair of lying racists...<br> ...who never, I repeat, never...<br> ...had any intention<br> of prosecuting this case.<br> You wanted to see me?<br> Come on, sit down.<br> You don't mind being seen in<br> the same room with a "lying racist"?<br> I don't mind if you don't.<br> You know Pat Bennett?<br> Sure, she's one of the best<br> lawyers in the state.<br> Why are we talking about her?<br> I thought she might be able<br> to help you on the case.<br> I've got it under control, Ed.<br> You have your share of<br> the 93 capital murder cases...<br> ...we have waiting for trial<br> under control?<br> What new excuse would<br> you suggest I give...<br> ...to the families as to why those<br> who've murdered their loved ones...<br> ...have yet to see a courtroom?<br> I'm just curious.<br> The fact that Pat Bennett is black...<br> ...wouldn't have anything to do<br> with this, would it?<br> I'm not gonna dignify that.<br> Whatever you may think,<br> this is not the Bobby DeLaughter case.<br> This is a case against the peace<br> and dignity of Mississippi.<br> Monday morning, I'm making a change.<br> You're about to hear the testimony<br> of a fingerprint expert...<br> ...concerning evidence he claims<br> to have identified in a certain glass.<br> You're entitled to consider...<br> ... the prosecution's failure to make<br> the glass available to the defense.<br> It is permissible that for one fact<br> alone to raise a doubt in your minds...<br> ... that will require<br> Mrs. Savage's acquittal.<br> -Can he do that?<br> -This is my case, damn it.<br> How dare they say<br> I'm putting on a show?<br> Only two people care about<br> this case, and I'm one of them.<br> If anybody's putting on a show,<br> they are. The only thing they' re--<br> They're only trying to stir up<br> emotions and position themselves...<br> ...as the saviors<br> of the black community.<br> Where you going?<br> This is Bobby DeLaughter.<br> I hope I didn't disturb you.<br> This won't take but a minute, ma'am.<br> When I started off,<br> I had nothing more than...<br> ...a couple of pages<br> in an old police report.<br> I spent the better part of a year<br> bumping up against dead witnesses...<br> ...and tracking down live ones.<br> My car's been vandalized,<br> my son's been in a fight...<br> ...and I've been called ugly things<br> by every racist in Mississippi.<br> Now, when there's a chance<br> for an indictment...<br> ...I've gotta fight off<br> black politicians too.<br> I'm sorry I lied about the gun,<br> but I've made a commitment to this case.<br> I'll be goddamned--<br> Pardon me, if I give it up<br> to some special prosecutor...<br> ...I don't care if he's<br> black, green or blue.<br> I'm committed and I'm asking you<br> to make a commitment to me.<br> If you do, I'll ride this thing<br> to the finish line...<br> ...or collapse<br> heading in that direction.<br> Thank you for your call,<br> Mr. DeLaughter.<br> The hell with her!<br> She's like all the rest.<br> The white world hasn't gone out<br> of its way to make her trusting.<br> When does it start?<br> What do I have to do?<br> We had a real chance to send<br> a message to this country...<br> ...that Mississippi isn't<br> a bunch of redneck racists.<br> My mother was right. We should<br> separate and let the South rise again.<br> -You don't believe that.<br> -Why not?<br> She doesn't want my help.<br> I'm just another white man<br> putting her in her place.<br> She sees no difference<br> between me and Beckwith.<br> -You didn't tell her about the gun.<br> -Right.<br> If I had it to do over again,<br> I still wouldn't have told her.<br> IKeeping the discovery of the murder<br> weapon a secret was a good strategy.<br> It wouldn't bother her a lick if I was<br> black. I'd just be a smart lawyer.<br> You can't have it both ways.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> You said the reason you didn't<br> tell her about the gun...<br> ...was that you were afraid<br> she would leak the story.<br> You can't expect her to trust you,<br> if you don't trust her.<br> I want you to meet with Pat Bennett<br> and bring her up to speed.<br> Fine.<br> It's for the best.<br> If you say so.<br> I'm going out.<br> You want something?<br> I'd like a Mercedes convertible,<br> but I'd settle for a Dr. Pepper.<br> There are four important<br> things in my life:<br> Medgar, Walter...<br> ...my children...<br> ...and this...<br> ...the original<br> court-certified transcript.<br> I've kept this for 27 years...<br> ...through three district attorneys.<br> Once I give this up...<br> ...I know that it may be gone forever.<br> I don't believe you'll find<br> anymore opposition...<br> ...to your continuing<br> to handle this case.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> It's truly appreciated.<br> Let's get the son of a bitch.<br> My pleasure.<br> The decision by the D.A.'s office...<br> ...to re-open the 27-year-old murder<br> case of Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...continues to cause controversy.<br> Citizens of Jackson are concerned...<br> ... that taxpayers' money is being<br> used to dig up the past.<br> The grand jury handed down an<br> indictment of Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...in the murder of<br> civil rights leader Medgar Evers.<br> Extradition in the Beckwith case...<br> ...is seen as a stumbling<br> block for the D.A.'s office.<br> I plan to fight repossession--<br> What's the word?<br> Extradition tooth, nail and claw!<br> In an attempt to replace<br> a lost autopsy report...<br> ... the D.A.'s office of Hinds County<br> today received permission...<br> ...by the Evers family<br> to exhume the body...<br> ...of slain civil rights leader<br> Medgar Evers.<br> The body, buried in<br> Arlington National Cemetery in 1963...<br> ... was found in remarkably<br> near-perfect condition.<br> After 18 months, extradition was<br> finally granted...<br> ...in the case<br> of Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ... the man accused of slaying<br> civil rights leader Medgar Evers.<br> Beckwith will face murder charges<br> ...for the same offense<br> ended in hung juries.<br> Thank you, son.<br> " I first received the call...<br> ...at 9 :42 p. m...<br> ...on the night of June 12, 1963.<br> My partner and I responded<br> and proceeded to the crime scene...<br> ...Iocated at 2332 Guynes Street."<br> That's pretty good, Benny...<br> ...but just because you read<br> the part of a dead witness...<br> ...doesn't mean you have to<br> act like you're actually dead.<br> I'm doing my best.<br> I know you are.<br> Medgar Evers' autopsy report<br> just came in.<br> You're not gonna believe this.<br> He's still dead.<br> Thank you, Clara.<br> I got off the phone with Charles Evers.<br> He won't come to the trial.<br> Did he say why?<br> He wouldn't say.<br> Get me the address<br> of his radio station.<br> They found a bullet fragment<br> in the body.<br> It's consistent with a.30-06 Enfield.<br> You'll be sorry. What happened to<br> that nigger will happen to you.<br> Another one?<br> Closer we get to trial, the more<br> nutjobs will crawl out of the woodwork.<br> You got a gun?<br> Here. T ake this.<br> No, wait. T ake this.<br> T ake this.<br> That was Muddy Waters doing<br> his thing for y'all.<br> Now I'll play a little something<br> that goes way back.<br> The great Robert Johnson.<br> Mr. Evers?<br> -Hi, I'm--<br> -Bobby DeLaughter.<br> Please sit down.<br> Robert Johnson.<br> IKing of the Delta Blues.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You're welcome.<br> May your soul rise up to heaven...<br> ...'fore the devil knows you're dead.<br> They say Robert Johnson sold his soul to<br> the devil to play the guitar like that.<br> What do you think?<br> If the devil wanted my soul, it'd cost<br> a lot more than some guitar lessons.<br> I believe after this trial's over...<br> ...Mississippi come through this time.<br> That's why I came here<br> to talk with you, Mr. Evers.<br> Would you change your mind and come<br> to the trial? Your presence...<br> ...would mean a great deal.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> Medgar was my baby brother.<br> There ain't nothing<br> I wouldn't do for him.<br> When we were little kids...<br> ...we used to sleep in the same bed.<br> And on cold nights...<br> ...I'd climb in first just so I could<br> warm up the sheets for him.<br> I didn't go to the first two trials.<br> Myrlie...<br> ...a lot of people,<br> they criticized me for that.<br> But I won't go<br> to no third trial neither...<br> ...and for the exact same reason.<br> I know if I ever got in the same room<br> with Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...as God is my witness...<br> ...I'd wrap my hands around<br> his chicken neck and snap it in half.<br> And nobody...<br> ...be able to stop me.<br> I wouldn't blame you.<br> Nobody hardly ever...<br> ...remembers Medgar anymore.<br> Whites or blacks.<br> And that's a goddamn shame.<br> Because whatever rights<br> the black man has now...<br> ...he's got because of something<br> called the Civil Rights Movement.<br> And for a long time here<br> in the state of Mississippi...<br> ...before the television, newspapers,<br> back before the fancy speeches...<br> ...my brother, Medgar, was<br> the Civil Rights Movement.<br> I'm sitting here tonight,<br> talking to my friend and your friend...<br> ...Assistant District Attorney<br> Bobby DeLaughter.<br> We're talking about my brother,<br> Medgar Evers...<br> ...and we're gonna play the blues<br> for Medgar all night long.<br> You and my sister-in-law...<br> ...you get justice for my brother.<br> Devil, if you listening...<br> ...I won't sell my soul<br> for no guitar lessons...<br> ...but I'll sell my soul for that.<br> Are you surprised bail<br> was granted so quickly?<br> Mr. Beckwith was being held<br> as a political prisoner.<br> He's not been found guilty.<br> Why should he be kept in jail?<br> Mr. Scott, you're an officer<br> of the Nationalist Movement, correct?<br> Is that where the money came from<br> to secure his bond?<br> Mr. Beckwith has a lot of friends here.<br> We'll do whatever it takes.<br> Suppose he doesn't show for the trial?<br> Suppose he leaves the country?<br> If he runs, we'll find him.<br> How long will that take?<br> Another five years? Another 10?<br> I've already devoted a lifetime to this.<br> That ought to be enough.<br> Yes, ma'am. It sure ought to be.<br> I'm sorry, Bobby.<br> It's all right, Mrs. Evers.<br> It's quite all right.<br> -How's Jared doing?<br> -Fine.<br> He and Burt seem like<br> they've been brothers all their lives.<br> They all sleeping?<br> And that's what you should be doing.<br> I want the opening statement<br> to be great.<br> It was great when you read<br> it three nights ago.<br> Unless you snuck in something about...<br> ...Beckwith deserving<br> the Nobel Peace Prize...<br> ...I'm sure it'll be great<br> tomorrow morning.<br> You see? That's why I look to you.<br> Eliminate Nobel Peace Prize reference.<br> That's good.<br> I left a gift for you in appreciation<br> for everything you're doing...<br> ... to ruin civilized society.<br> -What the hell is this?<br> -It's scheduled to go off at 10 p.m.<br> You have a nice night.<br> It's a bomb.<br> Everybody, get up.<br> Let's go.<br> What's going on?<br> It's nothing at all. Outside that door.<br> A little drill is all.<br> Head for the front door.<br> Is this still the drill?<br> Where are we going, Dad?<br> Told you we're going<br> to the Holiday Inn.<br> Is that where we're going?<br> The Holiday Inn?<br> That's right.<br> We haven't found anything,<br> but we'll go through it one more time.<br> I appreciate that.<br> I told them if anything ever happened,<br> all they had to do was walk away.<br> How're they supposed to walk away<br> from a bomb?<br> There wasn't a bomb.<br> This time.<br> If you want to give this thing up,<br> I understand.<br> No one could fault you. But the world<br> isn't going to be any safer.<br> I don't give a shit about the world.<br> These are my children.<br> Yes, they are.<br> Someday they'll be able<br> to tell their children...<br> ...that their daddy put away<br> Medgar Evers' killer.<br> Medgar Evers was a fool,<br> and my daddy was right.<br> Doesn't matter how many<br> civil rights laws you pass.<br> You'll never legislate<br> how people think.<br> There are always gonna be<br> a few misguided people.<br> I'm not talking about a few people.<br> I'm talking about everybody, about us.<br> Do we have one single<br> black friend? No.<br> We don't have dinner with them<br> or have them over.<br> We don't sit with them in church.<br> You think this one trial will<br> magically change this?<br> No, I don't.<br> It's a step.<br> That's all anyone can do<br> is take a step.<br> Why do I have to take that step?<br> So some sick son of a bitch<br> can murder my wife and kids?<br> Excuse me if I'm not interested<br> in taking that step.<br> Where are you going?<br> For a drive.<br> " I don't know if I'm going to heaven<br> or hell, but I'm going from Jackson."<br> We're on record in the matter<br> of Mississippi v. Byron De La Beckwith.<br> Does prosecution have<br> its opening statement?<br> We do, Your Honor.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...this is a very simple case.<br> It's about a man whose life<br> was snuffed out...<br> ...on June the 12th of 1963...<br> ...by a bullet that tore<br> through his body.<br> A bullet aimed out of prejudice...<br> ...propelled by hatred...<br> ...and fired by<br> a back-shooting coward...<br> ...from ambush...<br> ...at night.<br> The evidence will overwhelmingly show<br> that Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...a self-proclaimed, rabid racist<br> on a lifelong mission...<br> ...to purge society<br> of anyone and anything...<br> ...that stood for integration...<br> ...is the man that fired that bullet.<br> Evidence will show how, when he<br> thought he beat the system...<br> ...he bragged about what he'd done.<br> Bragged about getting<br> away with murder.<br> The evidence will undeniably show that<br> the person who pulled the trigger...<br> ...and ended the life of Medgar Evers<br> is this defendant...<br> ...Byron De La Beckwith.<br> Mr. Coxwell?<br> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.<br> My name is Merrida Coxwell.<br> This is James Kitchens...<br> ...and we are representing<br> Mr. Beckwith.<br> Mr. DeLaughter started<br> his opening statement...<br> ...by saying that this was<br> a very simple case.<br> I agree with him.<br> But what Mr. DeLaughter is going<br> to rely on is for you...<br> ...to convict Mr. Beckwith<br> simply because of his opinions.<br> That's because...<br> ...he knows that the state cannot prove<br> to you beyond a reasonable doubt...<br> ...that the defendant committed<br> the crime.<br> By the time this trial is over...<br> ...you will have seen it was<br> physically impossible...<br> ...for Mr. Byron De La Beckwith<br> to have killed Medgar Evers.<br> Mr. Beckwith is not guilty.<br> That's what the proof will show.<br> Thank you.<br> The state may call its first witness.<br> The state calls Myrlie Evers.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> Do you swear to tell the truth...<br> -...the whole truth, so help you God?<br> -I do.<br> Be seated.<br> Will you tell us your name?<br> My name is Myrlie Evers.<br> Going back to 1963,<br> were you married at that time?<br> Yes, I was.<br> And to whom were you married?<br> Medgar Wylie...<br> ...Evers.<br> When was the last time<br> you saw your husband alive?<br> June 11, 1963.<br> I'd fallen behind...<br> ...in my housework<br> and got up early that morning...<br> ...to iron some shirts for Medgar.<br> By the time he woke...<br> ...I had 10 freshly ironed shirts<br> neatly hung on hangers.<br> He said, "I thank you<br> for ironing these shirts...<br> ...but I'm not going to need them."<br> Before he left for work that morning,<br> he kissed us all goodbye...<br> ...and then left.<br> But then he came back...<br> ...and took me aside.<br> He said, "If anything<br> should happen to me...<br> ...I want you to promise me...<br> ...you will take care of my babies."<br> I said, "Of course.<br> They're my babies too."<br> He then kissed us all<br> goodbye again and left.<br> Could you tell the jury<br> what you remember...<br> ...seeing and hearing when your husband<br> returned home that night?<br> It was just after midnight<br> when he got home.<br> We heard the car.<br> And then there was...<br> ...this horrible blast.<br> The children...<br> ...fell to the floor<br> as their father had taught them.<br> I bolted to the front door.<br> Medgar was lying in the carport.<br> He still had his keys in his hand.<br> Blood everywhere.<br> The children came out<br> shortly after I did...<br> ...and they were screaming...<br> ... "Daddy!<br> Daddy, get up!<br> Daddy, please get up."<br> But I knew he would<br> never get up again.<br> Nothing further, Your Honor.<br> Mr. McIntyre, have you ever owned<br> a 1917 Enfield.30-06 rifle?<br> Yes, I have.<br> Did you own that rifle in 1963?<br> Sometime, I believe in 1960,<br> I traded it to Mr. Beckwith.<br> Mr. McIntyre, I want to show you<br> this firearm and ask if you would...<br> ...read the serial number<br> on the barrel, please.<br> Thank you. Going back to exhibit 35,<br> would you read the serial number...<br> ...on the invoice of the gun<br> that you purchased...<br> ...and later traded to Mr. Beckwith?<br> Ms. Holder, were you at Joe's Drive-In<br> on the night of June 11, 1963?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I wasn't working, but I was there<br> hanging out with my friends.<br> T ell the jury if there came<br> a time when your attention...<br> ...was directed towards<br> any particular automobile.<br> Being a carhop, you notice cars.<br> This one had a long antenna<br> on the side of it.<br> We thought at first<br> it was a patrol car.<br> It was white and it had<br> a lot of mud on it.<br> It was a Plymouth Valiant.<br> Mr. Hargrove, were you employed by the<br> Jackson Police Department in June 1963?<br> Yes, I was.<br> In charge of the ldentification Division<br> for 42 years.<br> Did you reach a conclusion<br> as to whose fingerprint...<br> ...was on the telescopic side<br> of the gun...<br> ...recovered in your presence<br> on June 12, 1963?<br> Yes, sir. I did.<br> With 14 points of identification,<br> there's more than enough...<br> ...to identify the fingerprint<br> of Mr. Byron De La Beckwith.<br> After four days of testimony in the<br> trial of white supremacist Beckwith...<br> ...the prosecution, thus far, has<br> presented essentially the same case...<br> ...as was offered up<br> in the two original trials.<br> However, this time there are<br> two significant differences.<br> First, the makeup of the jury.<br> In 1964, Beckwith faced<br> two all-male, all-white juries.<br> Today, he faces a jury made up<br> of eight blacks and four whites.<br> Tomorrow the prosecution is expected<br> to introduce three new witnesses...<br> ... who did not testify<br> in the first two trials.<br> State your name for the record.<br> Delmar Dennis.<br> Mr. Dennis, in March of 1964...<br> ...were you a member<br> of an organization known as...<br> ...the White Knights<br> of the Ku Klux Klan?<br> I was.<br> In September of that year...<br> ...did you become<br> a paid informant for the FBl?<br> I did.<br> And in your capacity as informant...<br> ...did you ever encounter<br> the defendant, Byron De La Beckwith?<br> I did.<br> What were the circumstances<br> of that encounter?<br> On August 8, 1965,<br> I met Mr. Beckwith...<br> ...at a Klan meeting<br> in Byram, Mississippi.<br> He was a featured speaker that night.<br> Now, during that talk, would you tell<br> the jury what, if anything...<br> ...the defendant said about the murder<br> or shooting death of Medgar Evers.<br> He said, "Killing that nigger gave me<br> no more inner discomfort...<br> ...than our wives endure<br> giving birth to our children.<br> We gotta kill those enemies...<br> ...including the President,<br> from the top down."<br> Did he say anything else?<br> Yes, sir.<br> He said, "You're gonna get away<br> with it like I did."<br> Thank you, Mr. Dennis.<br> Your witness.<br> You have seen FBl reports<br> about your activities...<br> ...as a paid informant, haven't you?<br> Mr. DeLaughter's office<br> furnished me with copies.<br> In fact, there are...<br> ...pages and pages of dialogue...<br> ...that you reported<br> to the FBl of things...<br> ...that various people said<br> over lunch, over dinner...<br> ...riding in cars, meetings.<br> Isn't that right?<br> Yet, nowhere in all those reports...<br> ...does the quotation that you<br> attributed to Mr. Beckwith appear.<br> Does it?<br> Maybe the pages got lost<br> over the years.<br> And maybe they never existed.<br> Objection.<br> Sustained.<br> Dog ate my homework.<br> Mr. Dennis, did Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...ever specifically say<br> that he killed Medgar Evers?<br> He never said, "I killed<br> Medgar Evers. "That's true.<br> No further questions.<br> That's what he meant.<br> We ask that the witness's unsolicited<br> opinion be stricken...<br> ...and that the jury disregard it.<br> The jury will disregard<br> Mr. Dennis' last statement.<br> I was standing out in the yard,<br> and he said something to me about...<br> ...having been tried twice<br> in Mississippi...<br> ...for "killing that nigger."<br> And what'd he say about that?<br> He said...<br> ... "I had a job to do and I did it."<br> Thank you, Mr. Prince.<br> Nothing further.<br> Back in 1986, when Mr. Beckwith<br> allegedly made this statement to you...<br> ...you went straight<br> to the authorities, didn't you?<br> Well, you must've told<br> some of your buddies.<br> You didn't tell anybody you were<br> renting a house from a man...<br> ...who admitted to you<br> that he'd killed somebody?<br> I didn't at that time, no.<br> Mr. and Mrs. Beckwith had you<br> thrown out of the house...<br> ...because you had<br> a drinking problem, right?<br> I had a drinking problem...<br> ...but that's not why they--<br> You don't particularly like Mr. Beckwith<br> for throwing you out, do you?<br> Mrs. Morgan...<br> ...when you lived in Greenwood,<br> Mississippi in the early 1970s...<br> ...did you and your husband give<br> the defendant a ride to Parchman Prison?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Me and my husband, Lloyd, was going<br> to see Lloyd's brother...<br> ...Jimmy Dale Morgan...<br> ...and Mr. Beckwith was going to see<br> some friend of his...<br> ...whose name he wouldn't tell us.<br> During that time, did he make<br> any statements concerning the murder...<br> ...of Medgar Evers?<br> Yes, sir.<br> He said that he had killed<br> Medgar Evers, a nigger...<br> ...and said we'd better not say anything<br> about us driving him up to Parchman...<br> ...because he wasn't scared<br> to kill again.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.<br> You have had some<br> very traumatic things...<br> ...happen to you in your life,<br> haven't you?<br> Most definitely.<br> Your estranged husband...<br> ...Lloyd Morgan, was<br> very abusive to you.<br> Objection. Irrelevant.<br> Where are you going with this?<br> If you'll allow me...<br> ...this line of questioning speaks<br> directly to this witness's credibility.<br> Overruled.<br> Your husband, you told us...<br> ...carried on an incestuous<br> relationship with one of his children.<br> Yes, he did.<br> And your father...<br> ...was very abusive to you<br> when you were a child.<br> Yes, sir.<br> And as a result...<br> ...of all this...<br> ...you have been diagnosed<br> by psychiatrists...<br> ...as having an anxiety disorder.<br> Yes, sir, I have.<br> I have nothing further.<br> If this jury wants to believe<br> a lying drunk, a paid informant...<br> ...and a damn loony bird...<br> ...then I might be<br> in a bit of trouble.<br> But not as much trouble<br> as our beloved justice system.<br> And this Prince fella<br> still owes me $ 64 worth of rent.<br> How do you account for<br> the matching numbers on the gun?<br> My rifle was stolen days<br> before this nigger turned up dead.<br> Turn those lights off.<br> Mom, how can you stand<br> watching this idiot?<br> When your father died...<br> ...I carried around<br> such hatred for that man...<br> ... I actually made inquiries<br> into having him killed.<br> But in time, I was able<br> to let that hatred go.<br> I don't know how.<br> I remembered something<br> your father once said to me.<br> He said, "When you hate,<br> the only person who suffers is you.<br> Because most of the people you hate...<br> ...don't know it<br> and the others don't care."<br> The big question here is<br> will Beckwith testify...<br> ...as he did so confidently<br> back in 1964?<br> Everybody wants to see<br> the Byron De La Beckwith Show.<br> What if putting him on is too risky?<br> You kidding? He'll wanna tell<br> that cock-and-bull story...<br> ...about his gun being stolen<br> two days before the murder.<br> Besides, this is Byron De La Beckwith<br> we're talking about.<br> Summoned from his mountain<br> by God Almighty...<br> ...to give us<br> the word according to Delay.<br> He'll testify.<br> I'll see you upstairs.<br> Something happen to you in your boyhood<br> make you mean-spirited...<br> ...enough to turn on your own?<br> Do what the good Lord and Mississippi<br> got every right to expect you to do.<br> Which is?<br> Putting niggers away for killing white<br> people instead of the other way around.<br> Mr. Peters and y'all should be run out<br> of this state for this foolishness...<br> ...and y'all probably will be.<br> This is not some deer you brought down.<br> This is a human being.<br> A deer, Mr. DeLaughter,<br> is a beautiful animal.<br> It's one of God's creatures.<br> I would never kill a deer.<br> A nigger, on the other hand,<br> that's another matter entirely.<br> Are you standing here<br> admitting to me that you--<br> IKilled Medgar Evers?<br> What if I did?<br> It's not like there's anything you<br> nor anybody else can do about it.<br> Is there?<br> We'll see about that.<br> Oh, that we will.<br> That we will.<br> You know, it only takes<br> but one of them, doesn't it?<br> The question is...<br> ...which one will it be?<br> Maybe that chubby white gal<br> who'd be sorely vexed...<br> ...to let one of her own kind be<br> put away, no matter what she told you.<br> Or maybe that old nigger minister...<br> ...who won't want sending a sick<br> old man to prison on his conscience.<br> You ain't never gonna get 12 people<br> to convict me of killing a nigger...<br> ...in the state of Mississippi.<br> No, sir. Hell, I don't even have<br> to take the stand.<br> Couple more days, I'll be heading back<br> to my home in T ennessee...<br> ...where I will sit on my porch...<br> ...and live out my days<br> in peace and prosperity.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> What are you gonna do?<br> " Free at last, free at last.<br> Great God Almighty, I'm free at last!"<br> The defense calls James Holley.<br> Relax. He's just needling you.<br> He'll testify.<br> Raise your right hand.<br> You swear the testimony you'll give<br> is the whole truth, so help you God?<br> -I do.<br> -Be seated.<br> Mr. Holley, did you have a personal<br> relationship with the defendant?<br> No, sir. None whatsoever.<br> I just kind of knew who he was.<br> Mr. Holley, in the early morning<br> of June 12th, 1963...<br> ...did you have occasion<br> to see Mr. Beckwith?<br> He was standing outside<br> at a Shell station...<br> ...while the attendant was<br> putting gas in his car.<br> T ell the jury what time<br> you saw him.<br> At approximately 1:03 in the morning.<br> About how many miles is it<br> from Greenwood to Jackson?<br> Must be around 90, 95 miles.<br> So you saw the defendant<br> less than an hour after the murder...<br> ...calmly standing by his car some 95<br> miles away from the scene of the crime?<br> I have nothing further.<br> Mr. Holley...<br> ...on the night you say you saw...<br> ...Byron De La Beckwith<br> in Greenwood....<br> Delay, as you call him, I believe.<br> Is that right?<br> Delay Beckwith, yes, sir.<br> Why do you call him Delay?<br> Are y'all first-name buddies?<br> No, sir. I call him Mr. Beckwith<br> most of the time.<br> We just noted...<br> ... "Delay's car"<br> and "Delay and the attendant."<br> Isn't that exactly what you told<br> me and my investigators...<br> ...when we asked what you were<br> doing that night?<br> "Delay."<br> Your buddy.<br> My friend.<br> And how long has he been your friend?<br> -Just shortly after World War ll.<br> -When you said...<br> ...you had no personal relationship<br> with him, that wasn't entirely true.<br> You've known him a long time and been<br> friends a long time, right?<br> Well, sure, we're friends.<br> Just like I hope<br> you and I are friends.<br> Pardon?<br> I said just like I would hope<br> you and I are friends.<br> I'm flattered.<br> Let me ask you this.<br> At the time the defendant<br> was arrested...<br> ...there were a whole lot<br> of law enforcement people...<br> ...trying to gather<br> information, am I right?<br> FBl, Jackson Police.<br> Do you remember that?<br> Did you speak to...<br> ...Detective Sanders,<br> one of the investigators?<br> I might've spoken a word with him.<br> Then you told him you saw Beckwith<br> in Greenwood the night of the killing.<br> -ls that right?<br> -I did not.<br> Why not?<br> I had no reason to tell<br> unless he asked.<br> You had no reason, as a sworn police<br> officer, to tell an investigator...<br> ...in an important murder case...<br> ...that you knew the suspect was 90<br> miles away at the time of the murder?<br> I'd have been butting<br> into his investigation--<br> You'd have been "butting into his<br> investigation "by telling him an alibi?<br> Sure.<br> Did you ever go to the D.A.<br> and tell them what was going on?<br> Did you tell the FBl<br> what was going on?<br> The only person you spoke to<br> about this case was Hardy Lott...<br> ...Mr. Beckwith's defense attorney.<br> -When he called me--<br> -How long was...<br> ...the defendant in jail by then?<br> A couple of weeks?<br> I don't remember, exactly.<br> Well, let me help you out.<br> It was over eight months.<br> Eight months.<br> You let your buddy sit in jail<br> all that time...<br> ...and never once told anyone,<br> "You've got the wrong guy."<br> You're asking this jury<br> to believe that?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Earlier in your testimony, you said<br> that you and I are friends, right?<br> Said what?<br> That we're friends.<br> You and I are friends.<br> You still think we're friends?<br> Sure.<br> As my friend, if I ever go<br> to jail for murder...<br> ...don't leave me there<br> for eight months...<br> ...if you know where I was<br> when the murder took place.<br> Objection!<br> That was a thing of beauty.<br> Nothing further.<br> Will you redirect?<br> Thank you, Your Honor.<br> Would you lie for Mr. Beckwith?<br> Did he ask you to?<br> As a former police officer,<br> you know perjury is a serious crime.<br> I'm gonna ask you this one last time.<br> On the night that Medgar Evers<br> was killed...<br> ...did you or did you not see<br> Beckwith some 95 miles away...<br> ...from where the murder took place?<br> I saw him.<br> As God is your judge.<br> As God is my judge.<br> Thank you, Mr. Holley.<br> We have nothing further.<br> No further questions.<br> You may step down.<br> Is the defense prepared to call<br> its next witness?<br> Your Honor...<br> ...the defense rests.<br> -What?<br> -Damn!<br> Quiet.<br> Ladies and gentlemen.<br> Quiet or I'll order the bailiff<br> to clear the courtroom.<br> Coward to the end.<br> To my knowledge...<br> ...this jury is being asked<br> to look further...<br> ...into the past than any jury...<br> ...in the history<br> of American jurisprudence.<br> That places you folks<br> at a considerable disadvantage.<br> Evidence has been lost.<br> They don't have the bullet.<br> They don't have the spent cartridge<br> case that was found in the gun.<br> They don't have the live ammunition<br> that was found in the gun.<br> Where is it?<br> Nobody knows.<br> Does this create reasonable doubt?<br> Of course it does.<br> And you have heard a number<br> of witnesses testify...<br> ...that years after the crime,<br> Mr. Beckwith said this...<br> ...or Mr. Beckwith said that.<br> But the defense has presented you<br> with an eyewitness.<br> A sworn officer of the law...<br> ...who has testified under oath<br> that he saw the defendant...<br> ...in Greenwood, Mississippi,<br> over 90 miles from Jackson...<br> ...Iess than an hour after the murder.<br> Does that create reasonable doubt?<br> You bet it does.<br> And reasonable doubt<br> means one thing...<br> ...and one thing only.<br> By law...<br> ...you must render<br> a not guilty verdict.<br> Forget that it's Byron "Delay" Beckwith.<br> Forget that you may not like him,<br> that you...<br> ...may not agree with him.<br> Judge the evidence...<br> ...and judge it fairly.<br> Because...<br> ...in the United States...<br> ...we don't do that for people<br> we just like and admire.<br> We do that for everybody...<br> ...that's on trial...<br> ...in an American court of law.<br> Because if the system doesn't work...<br> ...for Byron De La Beckwith...<br> ...it doesn't work...<br> ...for anyone.<br> I ask you to let the system work...<br> ...and once and for all...<br> ...find the defendant...<br> ...Byron De La Beckwith,<br> not guilty.<br> Thank you.<br> An unarmed man...<br> ...arrives home in the late hours<br> of the night...<br> ...home to his family, his wife...<br> ...and three small children...<br> ...gets out of his car...<br> ...and with his back turned...<br> ...is gunned down by a coward.<br> That coward is...<br> ...Byron De La Beckwith.<br> His gun.<br> His scope.<br> His fingerprint.<br> His car.<br> And lastly, but certainly not least,<br> his mouth.<br> When he thought he got away with it...<br> ...he couldn't keep his mouth shut<br> with people he wanted to impress.<br> And now his venom has come back<br> to do him in...<br> ...because, ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...there is no statute<br> of limitations on murder.<br> The law doesn't say<br> that if you killed someone...<br> ... 10 years ago or 20 years ago...<br> ...or even 30 years ago,<br> that you don't have to pay the price.<br> The law doesn't say that if you are<br> ...or 70 years old,<br> that you don't have to pay the price.<br> No man...<br> ...is above the law.<br> And for what reason...<br> ...was Medgar Evers' life taken?<br> For wanting some degree<br> of equality for himself...<br> ...his family and his fellow man.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,<br> when that kind of murder happens...<br> ...no matter who the victim...<br> ...no matter what his race...<br> ...there is a gaping wound...<br> ...Iaid open on society as a whole.<br> Justice...<br> ...has sometimes been referred to...<br> ...as the soothing balm<br> to be applied...<br> ...to the wounds inflicted on society.<br> But when there is no justice...<br> ...those wounds can never be cleansed.<br> Those wounds can never be healed.<br> When I addressed you<br> in my opening statement...<br> ...I said that this was a simple case.<br> Well, I was right and I was wrong.<br> The evidence is simple...<br> ...and the conclusion is<br> more than obvious.<br> But the reason we are all...<br> ...sitting in this courtroom<br> so many years after...<br> ...this disgraceful<br> assassination took place...<br> ...is anything but simple.<br> President John F. Kennedy...<br> ...in his landmark civil rights speech<br> to the nation...<br> ...delivered on the very night<br> Medgar Evers was murdered, said...<br> ... "We face a moral crisis<br> as a country...<br> ...and as a people.<br> Those who do nothing are<br> inviting shame...<br> ...as well as violence.<br> Those who act boldly are<br> recognizing right...<br> ...as well as reality."<br> Today, 30 years later...<br> ...on behalf of the state<br> of Mississippi...<br> ...I'm asking you 12 ladies<br> and gentlemen to act boldly.<br> To hold this defendant accountable<br> and find him guilty...<br> ...simply because it is right...<br> ...it is just...<br> ...and Lord knows, it is time.<br> Is it ever...<br> ...too late to do the right thing?<br> For the sake of justice...<br> ...and for the hope of us<br> as a civilized society...<br> ...I sincerely pray that it is not.<br> Thank you.<br> How long do you think they'll be out?<br> All I know is a short time is good<br> and a long time is...<br> ...not so good.<br> Then I'll pray for a short time.<br> This reminds me of Medgar's office<br> on Lynch Street.<br> You know, I used to be<br> Medgar's secretary.<br> He insisted that we behave<br> in the office...<br> ...strictly as employer-employee.<br> He'd call me Mrs. Evers,<br> and I'd have to call him Mr. Evers.<br> Is that right?<br> Everybody thought he was crazy.<br> But he was just so determined<br> to do a good job.<br> You remind me of Medgar.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> Would you like a cup of coffee?<br> No, thanks.<br> As many trials as I've been through<br> and I can never take the waiting.<br> Wanna go for a walk?<br> No, you go ahead. I've gotten<br> pretty good at waiting.<br> That Judge Hilburn...<br> ...he don't have a lot of patience.<br> That jury ain't back with a verdict<br> in a few hours...<br> ...he'll declare a mistrial.<br> I'm not sure I got that.<br> Would you mind repeating that,<br> please?<br> You did say mistrial, didn't you?<br> I'm gonna snooch you.<br> All rise.<br> When the verdict is read...<br> ...there will be no demonstrations...<br> ...or any emotional outbursts<br> of any type.<br> Has the jury reached a verdict?<br> It has, Your Honor.<br> If the bailiff will hand me<br> the verdict.<br> I'll ask the jury at this time<br> to stand and face the defendant.<br> The defendant will face the jury.<br> The jury foreman will now<br> read the verdict.<br> We the jury...<br> ...find the defendant...<br> ...Byron De La Beckwith,<br> guilty as charged.<br> -Quiet in this courtroom.<br> -Guilty.<br> Mrs. Evers, how did you feel<br> when the verdict came in?<br> It's been a long journey.<br> Medgar, I've gone the last mile<br> of the way.<br> I've gone the last mile of the way.<br> And all I want to say...<br> ...is yea, Medgar!<br>
