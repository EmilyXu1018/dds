                        There he is.<br> There's the stallion. That's War Winds.<br> Beautiful.<br> That's my daughter riding him. Leslie.<br> Leslie is my daughter. She's riding him.<br> Doctor, that sure is a beautiful animal.<br> We'll get to the horses<br> first thing in the morning.<br> Now you'll come up to the house<br> and get ready for dinner.<br> So you are from Nevada, Mr. Beckwith?<br> Texas, Mama.<br> You're from Texas, Mr. Beckwith?<br> Yes, ma'am, Texas. Benedict's the name.<br> You're here about the horses, aren't you?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> I came to buy your stallion, War Winds,<br> that is if your daughter doesn't mind too much.<br> In all likelihood,<br> our Leslie will be leaving us soon in any case.<br> David is with the embassy in Washington.<br> He's been called back to England.<br> Will she like it there, do you think?<br> She's going to marry him?<br> Mother! Let me sell Mr. Benedict<br> War Winds.<br> I can tell you all his bad points.<br> For one thing, he eats too much,<br> doesn't he, Papa?<br> 'Cause you see, it's either War Winds or me.<br> Something has to go.<br> Now Leslie you know very well that horse is<br> just too spirited for any woman to ride.<br> I know Miss Leslie that your horse is gonna miss you<br> and all this nice, green country, but...<br> I'll do my best to make him feel<br> right at home in Texas.<br> Isn't Texas green, Mr. Benedict?<br> Well, no ma'am, not altogether.<br> You must tell us about Texas,<br> Mr. Benedict.<br> Well, it's not that easy.<br> It's different than any other state, I think.<br> At least that's what we think.<br> It's almost a different country.<br> From an Englishman's point of view,<br> its mere size takes your breath away.<br> Yes, it's big all right.<br> How large are your ranches?<br> Most every size. Large and small.<br> Mr. Benedict's Reata is<br> one of the largest of them all.<br> Oh, really?<br> And just how large is that?<br> It's one of the biggest.<br> How big is that?<br> There are one or two others as big,<br> I suppose, up where we come from...<br> and some larger ones<br> on the coastal plains.<br> Can't you be more specific?<br> What's the size of your place?<br> Around a half million.<br> I'd call that quite a parcel!<br> How many acres did you say,<br> Mr. Benedict?<br> He said 595,000 acres, Mama.<br> And you should see the greedy look<br> on your face.<br> Witness excused.<br> Won't you join us at the Hunt Ball?<br> I'm sure you'll enjoy it.<br> No, thank you, Miss Leslie.<br> I'm afraid I wouldn't look good<br> in this outfit.<br> I like your country.<br> Why don't you stay a while<br> and really see something of it?<br> It's roundup time in my country.<br> Big spring roundup.<br> Your country?<br> Reata.<br> Your country, my country.<br> You make us sound so far apart.<br> Maybe you could come out and see it...<br> if you get a chance.<br> I'll be off real early in the morning, so...<br> goodbye.<br> I'm awfully glad you came.<br> I'm not going to say goodbye to you<br> in the moonlight.<br> It would just be too touching. Good night!<br> " Texas."<br> Are you in love with him?<br> Yes, I think so.<br> Will you do me a favor<br> and run along to bed?<br> -Leslie?<br> -Good night.<br> If you won't marry David Karfrey...<br> will you give him to me?<br> Yes! Now, good night.<br> As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.<br> -$10,000 is a lot of money.<br> -It's a lot of horse.<br> Let's have some breakfast and get going.<br> -Why, Leslie!<br> -Good morning.<br> You don't look as if you'd been dancing<br> all night, Miss Leslie.<br> I came home at 10:55.<br> I read about Texas until 5:00 this morning.<br> Let the poor boy<br> eat his breakfast in peace.<br> It takes a heap of reading, Texas does.<br> We really stole Texas, didn't we?<br> I mean, away from Mexico.<br> You're catching me a bit early<br> to start joking.<br> But I'm not joking.<br> It's all right there in the history books.<br> Mr. Austin came down<br> with 300 families, it says.<br> The next thing you know,<br> they're claiming it from Mexico.<br> I never heard anything as ignorant<br> as some Eastern people--<br> Oh, please, Jordan.<br> I'm only speaking impersonally.<br> About history.<br> You all think<br> that the glory happened in the East...<br> with Valley Forge and Bunker Hill!<br> Do you know about San Jacinto?<br> Have you heard about the Alamo?<br> Why, certainly.<br> I read about them all last night.<br> I didn't mean to be impolite,<br> but it's so new to me.<br> I just mean, it's just all so new...<br> and so fascinating!<br> You mustn't talk that way to a Texan.<br> They feel very strongly about their state.<br> He shouldn't take it so hard.<br> Jordan, you would think<br> somebody had spoiled you terribly.<br> Your wife or somebody.<br> I haven't any wife. I live with my sister.<br> Why aren't you married?<br> First you attack a man's country,<br> and now you try to pry into his family life.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> -Good morning.<br> -Good morning.<br> -Good morning, Lacey.<br> -Good morning, Papa.<br> How are we doing?<br> We'll have to be getting along soon<br> if you're going to make your train.<br> -Good morning, everybody.<br> -Good morning, Nancy.<br> Good morning, dear.<br> Good morning, Mr. Benedict.<br> Isn't this a beautiful morning?<br> Leslie, if Mr. Benedict has finished<br> his breakfast...<br> why don't you show him the stables?<br> We've just quarreled politely about Texas.<br> It's no use trying to pawn me off on him.<br> And anyway, Mother...<br> he's probably engaged to marry<br> the daughter of the adjoining ranch...<br> who, though beautiful,<br> is comparatively poor.<br> She only has 200,000 acres<br> and half a million cows.<br> Is she pretty?<br> We must hurry.<br> Mr. Benedict and I will have<br> to be leaving now.<br> Who, may I ask, is the lucky young lady<br> that you're going to marry...<br> with all those cows?<br> I'll get the car.<br> It's funny, ma'am.<br> My neighbor is a girl, Vashti Hake.<br> There was some talk of my marrying her,<br> but I'm not.<br> Come on, if you want to catch that train.<br> It all sounds so romantic!<br> Come along, David, you're for me.<br> What's that, a wolf?.<br> No, honey.<br> It's just a little old coyote.<br> Don't you think you've done<br> enough sightseeing?<br> Tell me when we're in Texas.<br> That's Texas you've been looking at.<br> For the last eight hours.<br> I don't know how other brides feel<br> on their honeymoon...<br> but I'm having a lovely time.<br> We can't say it's been dull.<br> That is, so far anyway.<br> Wake up, honey. We're here, honey.<br> Where?<br> Hello.<br> Good morning.<br> Is that Texas?<br> It's Benedict. That's where we ship from.<br> These people never learn!<br> I'm Mrs. Benedict.<br> That means, " Welcome, the newlyweds."<br> Let's go, Leslie.<br> And what is your name?<br> That's a beautiful name.<br> Come on, it's 50 miles to coffee.<br> This is it, honey. This is your home.<br> But it's huge!<br> I thought it was a ranch house.<br> My old man built it to show the cotton<br> crowd we were just as high-powered.<br> It's enormous just for the two of us.<br> Luz lives here with me.<br> With us.<br> She's run the house since Ma passed on.<br> Some say she even runs the ranch!<br> Take it easy, Leslie.<br> What are your names?<br> What do you mean behave?<br> Here we don't make a fuss<br> over those people. You're a Texan now.<br> Is that a state of mind? I'm still myself.<br> You're my wife, honey. You're a Benedict.<br> I still have a mind of my own.<br> Elsewhere, being gracious is acceptable.<br> We're gracious, but....<br> Fine thing...<br> standing here quarreling<br> with rice still in our hair!<br> It's so nice and cool!<br> I thought somebody was hurt, maybe.<br> We didn't know you were there.<br> Well, we're home. We're here.<br> I've been looking for you for weeks.<br> We weren't expected to be back sooner,<br> were we?<br> With all the spring work to be done,<br> the roundup...<br> I didn't figure Bick would stay away.<br> If I miss a roundup every time I have<br> a honeymoon, I won't miss much, will I?<br> I thought I fired him off this place.<br> Where do you think you're going<br> with my automobile?<br> Just hold on.<br> Don't go taking off on me.<br> That old truck broke down again.<br> You want me going down the road?<br> That's exactly what I was going to do.<br> But she said,<br> "You stay on and do your work."<br> Next time I tell you to get, you get!<br> Bick and Jett are everlasting jangling<br> about something.<br> -Madama is the one who told me to stay.<br> -That's right.<br> With you away,<br> we needed all the help there was.<br> They're all scared to death of her.<br> You know that.<br> Everyone, except you and me.<br> You just tend to your work.<br> Tell me who is the boss around here...<br> and I'll be glad to do anything you want.<br> Just tell me who's the boss.<br> This is Bick's new wife.<br> Leslie, this boy here is Jett Rink.<br> -Hello.<br> -He works for us.<br> You'd better get going, Jett,<br> and get that truck fixed.<br> Nobody is king in this country.<br> Nobody, no matter what they think.<br> I'm sorry, honey. Things go loco here<br> every time I'm away.<br> Remember the time of the big rodeo?<br> Old Kale Beebe blew in,<br> higher than a kite...<br> slept on the sofa in your office.<br> He must have had nightmares.<br> He cut the couch to ribbons with his spurs.<br> This here is Bick's room.<br> This down here is your room, honey.<br> Look....<br> We're married.<br> You know how that is.<br> We'll take the connecting rooms.<br> We'll make that into a sitting room<br> where we can sit and talk...<br> and the breeze can get at us.<br> Breakfast's ready.<br> You and Jordan<br> have had breakfast already?<br> We have our coffee and talk<br> every morning of our lives at 5:00.<br> Try and get things rounded up for the day.<br> I thought I was going riding with him<br> to the roundup.<br> It would've been too hot for you.<br> I told him so.<br> Bring it in here.<br> You gotta watch out for that sun.<br> It's rough.<br> Sit down.<br> Your blood's too thin. That's the trouble<br> with a lot of Easterners.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm fine, Luz.<br> I'm a lot tougher perhaps<br> than you think I am.<br> Me...<br> I never had a sick day in my life.<br> Except when I got thrown and tromped on.<br> All you gotta do is take it easy.<br> This rich Texas air will fix you up.<br> Don't you worry none<br> about being lonesome.<br> I'll round up the neighbors.<br> You're going to meet some folks.<br> Yes, indeed.<br> You're going to meet some folks.<br> This is Mr. and Mrs. Bale Clinch.<br> Bick, it's about time. Howdy, ma'am.<br> I'd like you to meet<br> my little wife, Adarene.<br> I'm mighty pleased to meet you.<br> This is Judge Whiteside.<br> How do you do, Mrs. Benedict?<br> We sure are proud to have you here.<br> Bick, congratulations.<br> Mighty happy for you, boy.<br> She sure is pretty.<br> I think so.<br> Here's Ula Japes.<br> Glad to meet you, ma'am.<br> Good to see you, Bick.<br> This is Ms. Wharton.<br> Howdy, Leslie. Mighty happy to meet you.<br> Fernie Kling.<br> We're glad to have you with us.<br> You've really done well for yourself.<br> Thank you, Fernie.<br> Now you'll meet the neighbor<br> I told you about.<br> The one who lives 50 miles away<br> with all those cows?<br> Vashti, I'd like you to meet my wife.<br> Hello, Vashti. So nice to meet you.<br> Jordan told me so much about you.<br> Mighty glad to know you.<br> I'm awfully glad we're neighbors.<br> I hope we'll be real close friends.<br> My name is Mort Snythe.<br> They call me Pinky.<br> Come here.<br> -Excuse me, ma'am.<br> -We'll be seeing you.<br> -This will perk you up, Miss Leslie.<br> -Thank you.<br> I propose a toast to a daughter<br> of old Maryland...<br> now blooming into a citizen<br> of the Lone Star State. To the bride!<br> Are you all right?<br> I'm fine, don't worry.<br> -There's more than one bride here today.<br> -How's that, Vashti?<br> Mort Snythe and I were married yesterday<br> in Hermosa.<br> I'm gonna kiss him!<br> I guess that leaves only me.<br> Why, Luz, everybody in the county knows<br> you'd rather herd cattle than make love!<br> One thing you gotta say for cattle:<br> You put your brand on one of them,<br> you know where it's at!<br> Come and get it!<br> The best food you ever ate, honey.<br> This is real Mexican barbacoa.<br> That's where we get the word " barbecue."<br> What is that?<br> Calf's head.<br> We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth<br> and then wrap it tight in canvas...<br> and put it down in a pit<br> of hot mesquite coals for 18 hours.<br> And do those brains taste sweet!<br> How fascinating!<br> I don't think I'm really terribly hungry.<br> It must be the heat.<br> You call this hot?<br> Wait till July!<br> Eat it while it's hot!<br> What's the matter with her, Bick?<br> That's what I was afraid of!<br> Leslie?<br> Good morning, Luz.<br> What are you doing up?<br> Getting breakfast.<br> I think there's something<br> we should get in the clear.<br> I don't want to take your place.<br> I want you to know that.<br> But I can't have you<br> taking my place either.<br> I can't be just a guest<br> in my husband's house.<br> There you are.<br> Good morning, darling.<br> -How are you feeling?<br> -Fine.<br> You look fine.<br> I want everybody to know, no matter<br> what happens around here in the future...<br> I am never going to faint again.<br> I'll never get the hang of you,<br> Mrs. Benedict.<br> A horse that cost you a lot<br> for breeding stock, I'd use it for breeding.<br> I wouldn't let anyone ride him.<br> I wouldn't care if she's your wife.<br> I'd see she rides a more gentle animal<br> if I were you.<br> She's going to fall off and break her neck.<br> That's Old Polo. He's head vaquero.<br> He's been here longer than any of us.<br> Since Grandpa Benedict's time.<br> Look at them, honey!<br> There's never been anything like them<br> in this world, I can tell you.<br> Did you ever see such stock?<br> Are they all ours?<br> These and 59,000 others just like them.<br> Granddaddy and his boys<br> used to drive his longhorns...<br> great herds of them,<br> all the way to Kansas.<br> He was a pretty good old boy.<br> I mean, he was tough, too.<br> My old man brought in stock from Europe<br> and bred them in the best ways.<br> Look out!<br> This right here is the result, honey.<br> Look at them.<br> How are you doing?<br> Tired, honey?<br> Don't you worry about me.<br> I'm a tough Texan now.<br> You know, I love you, Tex.<br> Howdy, everybody.<br> Hold on a minute. I want you<br> to take Mrs. Benedict back in with you.<br> Go with Jett, and get out of this heat.<br> Honey, I'm fine, really.<br> There's no use overdoing it.<br> Go along with Jett.<br> Good morning, Jett.<br> Take it easy, Jett.<br> I don't want to chew on this, Bick...<br> but I think we'd better get it straight.<br> I run the house, don't I?<br> Her house. Her kitchen. Her help.<br> She doesn't even speak Spanish.<br> They understand English<br> when they want to.<br> I know how to handle Mexicans.<br> I've done it all my life.<br> They'd sit on their honkers all day<br> if I didn't keep after them.<br> All right, Luz. Cool off.<br> I thought we ought to talk<br> without her around.<br> I don't want to feel that you're setting up<br> against me, Bick.<br> Nobody is setting up against you, Luz.<br> That gal's my wife.<br> And you're fair enough, I think,<br> to try and get along with her.<br> All right.<br> I'll get a horse and help push<br> the stock along.<br> Maybe it'll make me feel better.<br> You gotta push something.<br> When I get enough, I'll ride on in.<br> Why did you come to Texas?<br> I mean, everybody else's trying<br> to get away from here.<br> Me, I'll get out of here one of these days.<br> This is my husband's land.<br> This is his home.<br> Who gets hold of this much land<br> unless they took it off somebody else?<br> You're not exactly loyal<br> to your employer, Jett.<br> No, I'm not complaining.<br> They bought this land long ago.<br> The Benedicts.<br> -They got it though purchase, years ago.<br> -Took it from some ignorant Mexicans.<br> That's not true. They bought and traded<br> for Spanish land grants.<br> They paid for it all right.<br> They paid five cents an acre.<br> I know my folks were here long enough<br> to get rich, too.<br> Except they just weren't so foxy.<br> Keep it on, boy. I'll ride him.<br> Nobody rides him but the seora.<br> I've been riding what I want to<br> for 30 years.<br> Already he bucked off Lopez.<br> If he bucks me down,<br> he won't be the first one that's done it.<br> I suppose you came out here<br> to show me how to run things, too.<br> Let's go.<br> I'm not too awful bad now.<br> I've got a few friends.<br> And Madama likes me.<br> And Bick....<br> Now, even old Bick likes me a little bit.<br> Of course,<br> they don't like me quite enough to...<br> kind of divvy up<br> what they got way too much of.<br> You're an odd one, aren't you, Jett?<br> But I like you.<br> I like you, too.<br> You're the best-looking gal<br> we've seen around here in a long time.<br> The prettiest one<br> I think I've seen down here.<br> Thank you, Jett.<br> That's a very nice compliment.<br> I'll tell my husband of that,<br> with your approval.<br> No, I wouldn't do that.<br> No, I wouldn't do that.<br> Beautiful Reata!<br> Them's your neighbors live there.<br> Them kids there.<br> Them's your ranch people.<br> Those are Angel Obregon's kids.<br> That's the man who met us at the train.<br> Sure in good shape, ain't they?<br> Whole bunch of them sick.<br> What's the matter with them?<br> I don't know. Just sick. Every one of them.<br> Wait a minute. I want to get out here.<br> I wouldn't do that if I was you.<br> Wait.<br> You're the boss.<br> And you know it, don't you?<br> May I come in?<br> I'm Mrs. Benedict.<br> Perdoname...<br> that I do not rise.<br> The baby is sick.<br> My milk is not good.<br> Have you seen a doctor?<br> Doctor? It is too far to come.<br> Mrs. Leslie,<br> I think we'd better be getting on.<br> This baby is extremely ill.<br> You're not supposed to be in there.<br> Try not to worry, Mrs. Obregon.<br> I'll be back soon.<br> Bick's going to blow a gasket.<br> What is it?<br> What's happened to him?<br> What's wrong?<br> Where in the world have you been?<br> I've been looking for you, too.<br> What happened to her?<br> I stopped by the village.<br> What happened?<br> It's just awful.<br> I don't know. She was riding War Winds.<br> She might have been thrown<br> or something.<br> What does the doctor say?<br> It's bad.<br> She hit her head on a mesquite stump.<br> She's been riding since she was six.<br> She could ride anything.<br> And now this happens.<br> How is she?<br> She's in a state of shock. Very serious.<br> Concussion, possible hemorrhaging.<br> I'm doing all I can do.<br> I called Dr. Borneholm on the phone.<br> He'll be along any minute.<br> If only I hadn't bought that horse....<br> Don't blame yourself, Jordan.<br> If I hadn't, she'd be alive right now.<br> Don't blame yourself.<br> This is a great misfortune,<br> but no one is to blame.<br> Things happen.<br> -Mrs. Benedict, this is Dr. Borneholm.<br> -How do you do?<br> I sure wish I could've made it for Luz.<br> Dr. Walker did everything he could,<br> I assure you of that.<br> Dr. Walker, there's more for you to do,<br> I'm afraid.<br> Mrs. Obregon's baby is very sick.<br> His temperature must be at least 105.<br> Will you stop by, please?<br> Mrs. Obregon?<br> In the village.<br> Jett will take you.<br> I'll go with you myself, Doctor.<br> What is this?<br> You can't do that.<br> He can't go there.<br> He's our doctor.<br> -Our doctor?<br> -Yes.<br> You mean, the Benedicts' only?<br> No, I mean, all of us.<br> He doesn't tend those people.<br> They have a way of doing things<br> by themselves.<br> How did she get there?<br> Now, don't go climbing on me.<br> I don't feel too good about it.<br> Jordan, darling,<br> I don't think you quite understand.<br> There's a child who's very sick.<br> I must take Dr. Walker.<br> You'll go, won't you, Doctor?<br> I'll be back just as soon as I can.<br> I'm a lot better, honey.<br> That's a good boy.<br> Where's my horse?<br> I shot him.<br> Bone was broken.<br> Somebody had to do it.<br> I thought it'd be better if it was me.<br> The baby?<br> He is alive, thanks to Dr. Walker.<br> Good.<br> We need you in here for a few minutes<br> if you can break away.<br> You're sure holding up fine.<br> In times like this<br> folks really show what they're made of...<br> and you're sure holding up fine.<br> Vern and me thought a lot of Luz.<br> I guess everybody did.<br> At least everybody came.<br> It's the biggest gathering for a funeral<br> I ever saw in Texas.<br> It's a shame Luz wasn't here to enjoy it.<br> I mean, she always did like<br> a big get-together.<br> She'd have had a fine time.<br> -Come to see us.<br> -Thank you. Bye-bye.<br> Come see us.<br> I think you'll agree, your sister<br> was a very generous woman.<br> She wanted that boy<br> to have something worthwhile.<br> Now, that little piece of land is worth...<br> $500, $600 at most.<br> I'm going to ask you, in reverence<br> to the memory of Luz Benedict...<br> I'm going to ask you<br> to give one Jett Rink...<br> a check for twice the value of that land.<br> We can clean up the whole matter<br> right now.<br> Come inside, I want to talk to you.<br> Just a minute, Bick.<br> I'm afraid I'm going to beat you to it.<br> I'm quitting.<br> I lost the one friend I had in this place,<br> and I know it, too.<br> So I quit, I dead quit.<br> You don't have to say another word to me.<br> Nobody's firing you.<br> Boy, howdy, nobody's firing me.<br> I told you, I quit!<br> Nobody wants to fire you.<br> Come inside and listen<br> to what we have to say.<br> Come on in here, Jett.<br> Come on in here, boy.<br> Hi, Jett. Nice to see you.<br> -Howdy, Jett. Good to see you.<br> -Howdy, Jett.<br> Have my seat, boy. Sit right down.<br> You sure look good today.<br> Sit down. I'm going to tell you about<br> a piece of luck that's come your way.<br> Sit down, young man,<br> and make yourself comfortable.<br> It's a real bad wind<br> that doesn't blow somebody some good.<br> I don't have to tell you that Luz was<br> a woman of strong, sentimental feeling.<br> She prepared a list of things she wanted<br> to give all the people on Reata.<br> Yes. We find that she wanted to....<br> We find that her bequest to you was<br> in the nature of a little piece of ground.<br> It's the little piece we used to call<br> Buffalo Wallow.<br> She wanted to give you something.<br> I know she did.<br> It's always been my aim to try<br> to keep Reata intact within the family.<br> Now, that little piece is worth at most....<br> How much, Bale?<br> At the most, I'd say $500 or $600, Bick.<br> Mr. Benedict, wanting to honor<br> his sister's wishes...<br> and, of course, right along<br> with his own personal feeling for you....<br> He wants to see to it that you get<br> something really worthwhile.<br> Now, to get down to the point, Mr. Rink...<br> we're prepared to place in your hands,<br> in cash...<br> the sum of $1,200.<br> $1,200...<br> which, any of these gentlemen here<br> I'm sure will be happy to tell you...<br> is twice the value of that land.<br> -Definitely.<br> -At least twice the value of that land.<br> That's a lot of money.<br> What are you aiming do with all of it?<br> You're in the chips now, boy.<br> There it is. There it is, boy.<br> And it's all yours.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> She sure was a fine lady.<br> Yes, she was a fine lady. Hallelujah!<br> Amen.<br> I want you to know<br> that I appreciate her generosity.<br> Yours, too, Bick. And you all.<br> I want to thank you for it.<br> You know something, Bick?<br> I don't know, but it might not be...<br> a pretty good idea<br> to gamble along with old Madama.<br> How do you mean?<br> Just gamble on.<br> Just keep what she gave me.<br> I'm sentimental, too, Bick.<br> I think it's good to gamble on with her.<br> I know that land ain't worth much...<br> but then someday I just might up...<br> and put my own fence around her...<br> and call her Little Reata.<br> See you.<br> There's one thing on this earth more<br> important than money, and that's land!<br> I heard Luz say it a thousand times.<br> Pa said it and Bick, too. And it's true!<br> If you ever get to Deep Smith,<br> you come and pay us a visit.<br> We're just on the other side of Umbarger.<br> Only a little-bitty, no-account piece,<br> only we had a run of luck.<br> -Only? Why, a gusher came in last year.<br> -How wonderful.<br> Right now it's bringing in a million.<br> -A million gallons?<br> -Dollars.<br> A million dollars a year?<br> A million dollars a month.<br> -Goodbye. Thanks for treating us right.<br> -Thank you for coming.<br> I just love talking to you, Uncle Bawley.<br> Now that it's over, you get your fellow...<br> to take you around<br> and show you our country.<br> See San Antonio, Dallas and Houston.<br> I'm so impatient.<br> I want to see it all right now.<br> You don't have to hurry, honey.<br> It'll be here when you get around to it.<br> It's been here a long time.<br> And when you've seen it all<br> and have lived with it as I have...<br> in 25 years from now,<br> you'll feel about Texas just like I do.<br> Twenty-five years from now!<br> Twenty-five years from now<br> I'll be almost 50.<br> It's a nice age, Leslie.<br> You'll see wonderful things in Texas<br> when you're 50.<br> Perhaps.<br> But I won't care as much then.<br> You'll care more.<br> Because then<br> you'll have been part of it all.<br> Come on, we need you in the powwow.<br> I'm coming, gentlemen.<br> You get with it, Gomez.<br> Get your people out.<br> I don't want any of them<br> sitting on their honkers come election day.<br> Everything will be bueno, seor.<br> It will be the same: good.<br> I love you.<br> Thank you.<br> We're just talking business. Just business.<br> Please, don't mind me.<br> Do go on.<br> I'll listen, quiet as a little old mouse.<br> You'd be bored, honey.<br> This is dull.<br> Why, I'd be fascinated.<br> We're talking about politics.<br> You married me in Washington,<br> remember, darling?<br> I lived next door to politics.<br> Brought up with it.<br> Please go on talking. I'd love it.<br> This is men's stuff.<br> Leslie, how about a cup of coffee<br> or a drink?<br> Men's stuff!<br> Lord have mercy!<br> Set up my spinning wheel, girls.<br> I'll join the harem section in a minute.<br> Don't you go worrying<br> your pretty little head about politics.<br> You mean my pretty, empty head,<br> don't you, Judge?<br> Could I get the coffee for you?<br> You, too, Uncle Brutus?<br> You don't feel well, Leslie.<br> I feel just great!<br> My adrenaline glands<br> are pumping beautifully.<br> If I may say so before retiring...<br> you gentlemen date back 100,000 years.<br> You ought to be wearing leopard skins<br> and carrying clubs.<br> Politics!<br> Business!<br> What's so masculine about a conversation<br> that a woman can't enter into it?<br> Leslie, you're tired.<br> Perhaps I am.<br> I reckon I'll go on upstairs<br> and get my beauty sleep.<br> You go ahead on, honey.<br> Good night, gentlemen.<br> That's right.<br> Send the children on up to bed<br> so the grownups can talk.<br> Good night, honey.<br> I must have dropped off.<br> Darling, I am sorry<br> about my caveman speech.<br> I'll apologize to the others first thing,<br> I promise.<br> That's big of you.<br> You certainly distinguished yourself<br> this evening.<br> -Shh, they can hear.<br> -Hear? They heard you already.<br> Every word you said out there.<br> We date back 100,000 years.<br> I said I was sorry about the name-calling.<br> It was very impolite, I know.<br> But in principle, I was absolutely right.<br> You come down here<br> and try to tell us how to run things.<br> Insulting my friends and everything.<br> Now you look here, Leslie.<br> You're my wife, Mrs. Jordan Benedict.<br> I'm asking you, when will you settle down<br> and behave like everybody else?<br> -Never!<br> -Who do you think you are, anyhow?<br> Joan of Arc, or something?<br> Jordan, where are you going?<br> Jordan, take off your hat.<br> Carrying on like Carrie Nation!<br> Preaching stuff that's none<br> of your business, fixing the world.<br> Why don't you join a club?<br> Honestly, Jordan.<br> You make me sound just awful.<br> I'm not all that bad.<br> You knew what a frightful girl I was<br> when you married me.<br> I did not deceive you, sir.<br> From the first moment,<br> I couldn't have been more unpleasant.<br> Anyway, you're stuck with me.<br> Yes, I guess.<br> Honey, take your hat off.<br> Besides...<br> you love me very much.<br> That fine mind of yours<br> gets pretty repulsive at times.<br> That's not what you told me on the train.<br> Now you're gonna throw that up to me.<br> I thought what we....<br> I thought what we said on the train<br> was in confidence.<br> Of course, darling.<br> But I'll never forget a single word<br> you say to me.<br> You can be pretty wonderful at times.<br> Come on, partner.<br> Why don't you kick off your spurs?<br> What a glorious, gorgeous,<br> brand-new day!<br> Let's spend every hour of it, just you and I.<br> Honey, I'm beat.<br> Why?<br> You have all the good things in the world.<br> And a woman<br> who loves you very, very much.<br> But that arguing takes a lot out of me.<br> That was just frightful.<br> The best part about quarreling<br> is making up.<br> When we make up, we make up.<br> Don't we, honey?<br> Why can't we take a trip, really see Texas?<br> Just let somebody else run Reata.<br> Couldn't we?<br> Honey, I want you to understand this.<br> I run Reata at all times.<br> That's the way it is.<br> Everything that's in it and on it<br> is run by me.<br> Don't raise your voice.<br> That's the way it's always been.<br> Everything that has a Reata brand on it<br> is run by me.<br> Does that include me?<br> That's the way my father ran this outfit<br> and my grandfather, too. All of it.<br> He kept it together for his son,<br> and my father for his.<br> And I'm keeping it together for mine.<br> All 595,000 square miles?<br> All of it. For my son.<br> You could at least say " our son."<br> Our son.<br> Don't you think that might be<br> a little too much for one little baby?<br> Not if he's a Benedict.<br> You'd better hope this is a boy.<br> Our baby. I just said I'm hoping it's a boy.<br> What do you mean?<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I'm telling you now.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> I mean, I should know.<br> -Are you sure?<br> -Sure.<br> And our baby is going to be a boy.<br> I know it.<br> A boy very much like his father.<br> In many ways...<br> but not all.<br> Shouldn't she be putting on<br> a little weight?<br> It's natural, I think,<br> for him to be gaining faster.<br> Let me see.<br> Very heavy.<br> Hello, sweetheart.<br> He's building up fine.<br> " I am now stronger than ever.<br> " I'm helping a young Dr. Guerra<br> get started here.<br> " Almost every day I find myself<br> walking three or four miles...<br> " through the dusty and dirty streets<br> of Vientecito village. "<br> Hello, Angel. How are you?<br> Good.<br> I'd like to speak to Mr. Gomez, the boss.<br> The man that runs this place.<br> Mrs. Benedict, what is it I can do?<br> Mr. Gomez, I'm going to leave<br> Dr. Guerra here with you.<br> He'll tell you things<br> that must be done immediately.<br> This place is a scandal.<br> Thank you, Dr. Guerra.<br> I'll get in touch with you.<br> Hello, Jett.<br> -Howdy, Miss Leslie.<br> -How are you?<br> I'm doing good.<br> -You made some improvements.<br> -Do you like it?<br> It looks good.<br> It ain't much yet, but it's coming along.<br> I wouldn't have believed it.<br> Believed what?<br> Truthfully, I didn't expect this sort<br> of talent to be one of your virtues.<br> That's the first time I was ever accused<br> of having any of that.<br> It really is nice, Jett. Real nice.<br> Someday...<br> I'll have a place<br> that no one will be ashamed of.<br> I cut them out of the newspaper.<br> I thought maybe they'd kind of<br> dress the place up a little bit.<br> Sweet of you.<br> Do you want to come on in here,<br> sit down and rest a minute?<br> Thank you.<br> Having kids seems to agree with you,<br> you know?<br> You're looking prettier than ever.<br> Just as good, anyway.<br> My goodness, and tea!<br> You like tea, don't you?<br> I love it. It seems down here everybody<br> drinks gallons of coffee.<br> I know.<br> Mind if I pay you<br> a rather personal compliment?<br> What is it?<br> You make a very excellent cup of tea.<br> I do a lot of things in a pinch.<br> Do you like one lump or do you like two?<br> I think I'll take mine straight.<br> That's good enough for me.<br> That's not too good, is it?<br> When will you get married, Jett?<br> Don't you need somebody to help you<br> with this kind of responsibility?<br> When I get some time to look around,<br> I'll go back East and....<br> To Maryland, places like that.<br> You got any attractive sisters there that<br> might be interested in some poor people?<br> Money isn't all, you know?<br> Not when you've got it.<br> The other people around here...<br> why don't they help themselves<br> like you've done?<br> When you say " other people,"<br> what do you mean?<br> I've just come back from Vientecito.<br> That bunch of wetbacks?<br> You don't go mixing me up<br> with none of them.<br> I'm just as much of Texas<br> as Bick Benedict is.<br> -I'm no wetback.<br> -I know that.<br> You're very like Jordan in that respect.<br> Attitude, everything.<br> But your situation is so different.<br> You're a working man.<br> That's something I'm gonna try to fix.<br> Someday I will.<br> All right, Gomez.<br> Yes, I understand.<br> Yes, thank you.<br> Thanks for the tea party, Jett.<br> And don't be such a stranger.<br> Stop by and pay us a visit.<br> I don't know about that.<br> Bick's still got his kettle on for me.<br> Leslie.<br> Hello, darling.<br> I was just having tea with Jett Rink.<br> Gomez telephoned.<br> "Mrs. Benedict went to Vientecito.<br> " I hope you're not displeased," he said.<br> I've told you before....<br> What's this about Jett Rink?<br> He made tea. Isn't that unbelievable?<br> He does so want to improve himself.<br> But your man Gomez, that camp he runs....<br> It's hopeless.<br> You can't go around this place<br> with no regard for who you are...<br> interfering with those people.<br> Jordan, that place is a scandal.<br> Dr. Guerra threw his hands up in horror.<br> That's his problem.<br> You've been a powerful Texan for<br> I'm not the Red Cross, I'm a cow man.<br> If you won't, I will.<br> If you go near those dumps again...<br> if I ever hear you get mixed up<br> in this migratory mess--<br> -What?<br> -I'll leave you!<br> That's what I'll do, I'll leave you!<br> There's my darling little girl.<br> Did you think your naughty mama was<br> never going to come up to see you?<br> One thing you can be sure of:<br> One of these days I'll run<br> that Jett Rink's hide out of this country.<br> Say hello to Luz. Say, " Hello, Luz."<br> Look there. Say hello to little Luz.<br> I don't care what you say.<br> She does look like Luz.<br> Oh, honey.<br> We're all gathered for the fourth<br> anniversary of my son's birth.<br> And your daughter's.<br> And I want to take<br> this auspicious occasion...<br> to say that this young fellow here...<br> is gonna grow up to be<br> one of Reata's top hands.<br> I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.<br> Maybe he'll even grow up<br> to be better than his old man.<br> Girls, look at the pony.<br> There he is, son.<br> He's all yours.<br> All mine, Daddy?<br> Take him around, Angel.<br> Take it easy, son.<br> He doesn't want to.<br> I rode before I could walk.<br> But that was you.<br> He's another person entirely.<br> He is a Benedict. He's gonna stay<br> on that saddle if I have to tie him on.<br> Take him away.<br> -No.<br> -Let him ride, Polo.<br> Let him ride.<br> Take him up for his nap. I think he's tired.<br> That wasn't so bad, was it, son?<br> Bick knows everything about running<br> a ranch.

I forget.<br> You know what they say?<br> That every girl in Texas was trying<br> to catch Papa.<br> They said, quote:<br> " There wasn't a prize bull like him<br> since Sam Houston got married."<br> That's enough from her.<br> I'm sure it's quite true, darling.<br> It took me two whole days to land him.<br> Really? It all sounds so fascinating<br> and uncouth.<br> Where are you going?<br> Down the road to Smitty's for Coke.<br> With who?<br> Nobody.<br> Stay at home.<br> Hey, you!<br> Hello, Papa.<br> Hi.<br> Where have you been?<br> Down the road for a Coke.<br> With who?<br> Bob.<br> -Howdy, Mr. Benedict.<br> -Hello, Bob.<br> Well, good night, Mr. Benedict.<br> Excuse me, Papa.<br> Look, Papa, are you busy now?<br> Never too busy for you, young fellow.<br> What's on your mind?<br> Well, Daddy, it's like this.<br> I am, Mama. I'm going to be.<br> I want to go to Harvard<br> and then to Columbia premed.<br> So you want to be a doctor?<br> Yes.<br> How about Reata, Jordy?<br> He's counting on you to take over.<br> Yes, I know he is. I know it.<br> But there are 50,000 guys who can do it<br> better than I can.<br> I don't want to live my life<br> pushing cows around.<br> I'd die for Papa if I had to.<br> Your father doesn't want you to die<br> for him. He wants you to live for him.<br> Talk to her, will you, Daddy?<br> Reason with her.<br> I don't want this pinned on me.<br> I'll take all the blame.<br> You just sort of soften the blow a little bit.<br> I'll talk to him myself.<br> You can persuade him, Mom.<br> I know you can.<br> It's not gonna be easy, honey.<br> Maybe I can catch her at a weak moment.<br> You can do it, Daddy. I know you can.<br> Darling, I've been thinking....<br> Me, too.<br> About the children.<br> That's funny. Me, too.<br> We must be getting old.<br> Speak for yourself.<br> I wonder if we love them enough<br> to do what's really right for them.<br> Why, sure.<br> I hope so.<br> I mean...<br> so we love them too much perhaps.<br> So much that we keep from doing<br> what's right for them.<br> Not me.<br> You don't have to worry about me.<br> It's always the mother.<br> The theory is she doesn't want<br> her fledglings to leave her nest.<br> Try their own wings. All that sort of stuff.<br> You mean...<br> you'd be perfectly willing to sacrifice?<br> Yeah.<br> I'd sacrifice for her. You know that.<br> I'm not so sold on that...<br> girl's school in Switzerland<br> you're stuck on.<br> Now, don't get your feathers up.<br> Judy's not crazy about that school either.<br> Of course she isn't.<br> That's exactly why she needs to go.<br> I wouldn't push her.<br> She...<br> wants to go to Texas Tech.<br> That's a man's school.<br> Girls go, too.<br> It's got the best animal husbandry course<br> in the country, she says.<br> She wants to be a rancher,<br> like her old man.<br> Like Bob Dace.<br> She's just got her little schoolgirl crush<br> on that hulking Bob Dace.<br> She's got her mind set on it.<br> That's what she wants.<br> And I, for one, am willing to sacrifice.<br> What do you say?<br> It seems we've hatched<br> an odd pair of fledglings.<br> Brace yourself.<br> Jordy wants to be a doctor.<br> He wants what?<br> He wants to be a doctor.<br> He's absolutely set on it.<br> Over my dead body!<br> You know what he's supposed to do.<br> Well, he's not.<br> He'd die for you, but he's not gonna<br> live his life for you. And he's right.<br> He'll do as we've all done.<br> He wants to go to Harvard first,<br> then Columbia premed.<br> You're pretty handy with those terms.<br> I can see who's been cooking this thing up.<br> Of course...<br> this would mean a big sacrifice<br> on your part.<br> No matter where he goes to school...<br> he comes right back home and runs Reata.<br> I guess you were right about one thing.<br> Me?<br> On one thing.<br> We are getting old.<br> Who?<br> We are, Jordan.<br> We are the older generation.<br> Aren't we?<br> Suddenly?<br> I guess so.<br> " ...unless oil or gas shall have been struck<br> at a lesser depth."<br> Is that about Vashti Hake's ranch?<br> Yes.<br> Good.<br> How about Reata?<br> No. That Benedict is a hard guy to crack.<br> Let's just keep punching, boys.<br> Hospital!<br> What's he covering up now?<br> He'll overstep the mark one of these days.<br> Give him enough rope.<br> Give him enough rope, and he'll hang you.<br> I'll get it.<br> Hello.<br> No, this is her daughter.<br> You'll have to find out for yourself.<br> -Take your social life on the other phone.<br> -It's for you.<br> I think he's nice.<br> -Who's nice?<br> -Jett Rink.<br> I don't want to talk to him.<br> What do I tell him?<br> Let me talk. I'll tell him.<br> I'll talk to him.<br> You've heard from me before on this, Jett.<br> Judge Whiteside told you, and I told you.<br> This is a cattle ranch, not an oil field.<br> That's the way it's gonna stay.<br> That's about the most expensive<br> phone call you ever made, Bick.<br> It'll cost you a billion dollars a year<br> for the next 50 years.<br> Couldn't we have just one little, itty-bitty<br> oil well, so I can get a private phone?<br> After reporting to President Roosevelt,<br> the Naval Secretary told the press...<br> that the battleship Arizona<br> and five other warships were lost...<br> in the Japanese air raid<br> on Pearl Harbor a fortnight ago.<br> He reported that 91 officers...<br> and 2,638 enlisted men were known dead.<br> That only makes me realize I'm losing you.<br> Here they are.<br> When did you two sneak in?<br> The honeymooners!<br> Judy, you're gonna get it.<br> You know Mom wanted a big wedding.<br> That's not true, Luz.<br> Not quite true.<br> We came for you to see Angel.<br> He's the first soldier from Reata.<br> -Merry Christmas, Polo.<br> -Merry Christmas.<br> Isn't he a fine-looking soldier?<br> Just a minute.<br> Merry Christmas, Angel.<br> Thank you.<br> Today the wish of all of us is<br> that the war ends quickly...<br> and that you, Angel,<br> return safely to Reata...<br> and to all of those<br> who love you very much.<br> I'll drink a toast to that.<br> Come on, now, and open it.<br> -Hello, Dr. Guerra.<br> -Hello, Dr. Benedict.<br> Just a little premature.<br> I know, it takes time.<br> Jordan, this is Juana.<br> She's been training out at the hospital.<br> It must be that darn north wind static.<br> Don't tell me you haven't learned that<br> dry wind, friction, and a heavy carpet...<br> are not the only means of creating<br> electricity between human beings.<br> Thank you.<br> Could you stay and give me the lowdown<br> on what it's like?<br> -Very nice to meet you.<br> -Nice meeting you.<br> -Goodbye.<br> -Adis.<br> -Let's get some Christmas cheer.<br> -You talked me into it!<br> Friends, we're gonna have<br> a mighty triumphant Christmas.<br> I'm gonna drink a toast<br> to two young men of Reata.<br> My two sons.<br> Thank you, Mr. Benedict.<br> Better take it easy on the bourbon, Dad.<br> It's not good for you.<br> I'm not kidding you.<br> I hate to see Angel go.<br> That boy is the best dang man<br> on the place.<br> It's time for you to take your place here,<br> to produce beef for the war.<br> They need doctors, Dad.<br> They need doctors in war, too.<br> I want to finish medical school if I can.<br> You are being bull-headed.<br> I never would be any good<br> at running this place.<br> Any man on Reata can do it better.<br> You're the one.<br> You're the one with a responsibility<br> to Reata.<br> Your blood pressure is going up<br> just while we're talking here.<br> Please, it isn't good for you. Just relax.<br> Don't you get fresh with me.<br> We're talking.<br> Yes, I heard.<br> It's Christmas morning. Isn't this<br> something you could discuss tomorrow?<br> There's nothing to discuss.<br> When I come home,<br> I'll work with Dr. Guerra in Vientecito.<br> I love Texas as much as you do.<br> I want to work here.<br> I just want to work in a different way,<br> that's all.<br> Come on, Jordan.<br> Work with Guerra!<br> Here's to you, Mr. Benedict.<br> You look beat, Mr. Benedict.<br> Here's to you.<br> It's pretty good stuff.<br> Did you make that yourself?.<br> Yes, I make it every year.<br> It's my Christmas special.<br> No, I mean the liquor.<br> Did you make the liquor yourself?.<br> If not, it's about the only thing<br> you don't produce on Reata yourself.<br> Come here and sit down.<br> I've got some serious talk<br> to make with you.<br> I've been watching you pretty close<br> for a lot of years.<br> You're a ranchman.<br> And you're smart.<br> You're wondering why I'm talking to you.<br> Bob Dace...<br> look me right in the eye.<br> You could never be anything but a rancher,<br> could you?<br> -No, sir.<br> -That's my boy.<br> But somebody else thinks I could.<br> Not my Judy.<br> -No, sir, it's not Judy.<br> -Who?<br> President Roosevelt.<br> Listen to this:<br> " To Robert Haskell Dace.<br> " Greetings from the President<br> of the United States."<br> Let me see that.<br> " You are hereby notified to report<br> on December 28...<br> " 5:00 a.m. for induction."<br> It don't matter.<br> Your job won't let you leave this place.<br> It'll make you stay right here.<br> This is just as important as carrying a gun.<br> I appreciate your confidence, sir.<br> But this is one thing<br> I'm not gonna try to get out of.<br> Have it your way.

Yours?<br> My father's, for instance. He spent his life<br> saving other people's lives.<br> How about some tax exemption there?<br> Leslie has always been a real sharp talker,<br> ain't she?<br> Fair enough, Judge.

I promised Jett.<br> Jett! What are you talking about?<br> He likes me. He likes my family, too.<br> He's always talking about you.<br> My dear, darling Luz...<br> if I didn't know you had a level Benedict<br> head on those immature shoulders...<br> I'd prescribe a good spanking.<br> He's dreamy.

That's me.<br> If you people stay away, Leslie, you'll be<br> the only folks in Texas who ain't there.<br> You'll be roped in with the herd.<br> You'll be putting on your pink shoes and<br> dancing to Jett's fiddles like the rest of us.<br> If we go then we'll do it right.<br> We're oil rich, like the rest of them.<br> We'll go like the rest of them! Only better.<br> Now you're talking like my father.<br> The old Benedict spirit.<br> You set up one of your great weekends.<br> Invite everybody.<br> We'll take them all with us.<br> We'll show that so-and-so<br> who's top people around here.<br> I'll even buy the four-engine Douglas.<br> Fly in some orchids from Hawaii.<br> We'll fly in low and shake the tiles<br> off that hotel roof.<br> There's Lola Lane!<br> I bet even Hollywood isn't this exciting.<br> -Isn't this something?<br> -It's perfectly fabulous!<br> Jett always tries to do things<br> in a bigger way...<br> and spend more money than anybody else.<br> Really? What does he do?<br> To some folks, he's just<br> a no-good wildcatting so-and-so.<br> There he is.<br> There's the emperor himself.<br> Isn't this terrific?<br> Look at Luz, she's queen of the parade.<br> You didn't tell me.<br> Did you know about this, Leslie?<br> No, I didn't.<br> My daughter, queen of Jett Rink Day!<br> What is this?<br> I don't know, Jordan.<br> She's done things before I haven't<br> gone along with, but this....<br> She's never been sneaky.<br> It's not exactly sneaky,<br> appearing in a parade.<br> Don't try to be funny.<br> I'm not. I'm just as upset as you are.<br> But Luz is intelligent enough<br> not to be imposed on by him or anyone.<br> Give me the desk.<br> It's Bick Benedict.<br> Did my daughter<br> Luz Benedict come in yet?<br> Get this. As soon as she comes in,<br> have her call me.<br> You know what I think I'll do?<br> I'm going to keep it just like this.<br> I'll keep all those people, send them home.<br> I'm not even gonna open up this place.<br> Some girls might like a hotel<br> all to themselves.<br> Me, I like company, Jett.<br> I like lots of people.<br> All right.<br> You want lots of people?<br> I don't see any problem there.<br> If there's anything you want,<br> just say it, and you've got it.<br> All right, I'd like a Coke.<br> No, that's impossible.<br> That's just impossible.<br> You know as well as I do, Cokes are taboo.<br> All soft drinks.<br> You make the rules.<br> You like things your own way, don't you?<br> Let me ask you something.<br> Do you like things your way?<br> Not many people have things their way.<br> No, I don't get them my way very often.<br> And you won't either,<br> until you get married...<br> and get your man<br> to give you what you want.<br> So?<br> So if I was you,<br> I'd start thinking about getting married.<br> You know, that's an idea.<br> You looked like a queen<br> in that parade today.<br> That was my job.<br> It's just what you are.<br> Luz Benedict ll.<br> You could be the head lady<br> of this part of the whole country...<br> if you wanted to.<br> If you married the right man.<br> That's a sweet idea.<br> Why don't I just announce it tonight...<br> with all them thousands<br> of people listening?<br> The whole of Texas.<br> Wouldn't that blow the roof off?.<br> Jett, tell me something.<br> Is this a proposal?<br> Does it sound like one?<br> After a fashion, but not quite.<br> You want me to say something<br> you can laugh at?<br> No.<br> I just think you're a wonderful girl.<br> And I do think you're beautiful.<br> You're fascinating to me.<br> I've always been looking for...<br> a girl like you.<br> Sure would blow the roof off, wouldn't it?<br> You've got a long way to go tonight.<br> I'm very flattered. Any girl would be.<br> You be a good boy now.<br> I'll see you later.<br> I hope this storm doesn't louse up<br> your party.<br> A slip-up, boy.

I'll be right in.<br> -Who's calling, please?<br> -Mrs. Benedict.<br> Come on along, Mrs. Benedict.<br> Thank you.<br> Keep everybody freshened up, will you?<br> We'll be quick.<br> We're anxious to see old Jett come out<br> in that suit.<br> Why couldn't they ride with us<br> like other people's kids do?<br> Luz had to fly her own plane<br> and Jordy and Juana had to drive.<br> Is anybody here?<br> We're all booked up.<br> I just called. I'm Mrs. Benedict.<br> I'm sorry, but we're busy.<br> I'll wait a little.<br> They're driving. It takes time.<br> I know it takes time.<br> I made the trip myself 500 times.<br> But don't worry about the children.<br> Their behavior is odd,<br> but their manners are beautiful.<br> Listen here, boy!<br> I've taken enough from you!<br> I didn't want to come here!<br> I wouldn't be here unless you let them<br> bully you into it.<br> Now, for heaven's sake,<br> let's make the best of it.<br> Cool down, go on with your shaving, finish<br> dressing, and I'll go downstairs with you!<br> Otherwise, you can go alone!<br> You know, honey...<br> you're awful cute when you get riled.<br> Hurry on in there.<br> Your ma and pa are sure having a battle.<br> Hello, honey.<br> Where have you been?<br> We got tied up in traffic.<br> Where's Juana?<br> She's in the beauty parlor.<br> Hello, sweetheart.<br> He's all right. He just didn't get his nap.<br> How's my child?<br> Is that Judy crying?<br> I hope I'm not too late.<br> No. Come right in.<br> Yeah?<br> Hello, Juana.<br> Yeah, he's here. Jordy, it's for you.<br> Yes, dear?<br> Stay right there, honey.<br> I'm coming right down.<br> Don't you folks wait on us, we'll catch up.<br> Son, you're way behind.<br> Howdy, everybody, look what we found.<br> There you are.<br> We were getting worried.<br> You'd better get dressed, Jett.<br> You wanted me to go over<br> the speech with you, too.<br> Come on, we'd better hurry.<br> I'm sorry, but it happens to be<br> Mr. Jett Rink's orders, himself.<br> I'm just working here.<br> Everybody's orders. Same all over town.<br> The young lady should have gone<br> to a place where they do her people.<br> If it isn't the queen herself!<br> -Are you having fun?<br> -We're making out.<br> -How are you doing?<br> -Good.<br> Where are Mom and Dad?<br> Don't trifle with your luck.<br> There you are.<br> You wanted to talk to me, Dad?<br> If you can spare me a moment,<br> I'd like to talk to you, young lady.<br> Dad, must we now?<br> Jordan, we must hurry to be in time<br> for the grand entrance.<br> Luz, darling, you look just beautiful!<br> Help me round everybody up.<br> I'm sorry I'm so late.<br> All right, people....<br> Did some of you boys change this around?<br> We haven't changed a single comma.<br> Changes tend to throw you.<br> " Columbus discovered only the shell<br> of this country. Agassiz came...."<br> Where's Rink?<br> He went that way.<br> Looks like I just come in for a root beer.<br> That, my friend, is a Texas range.<br> What're you doing sitting up there?<br> " You've heard of Paul Revere?"<br> The Texan said, " Paul Revere?<br> " Oh, yes. Ain't he the fellow<br> that had to ride for help?"<br> In just a few moments, Mr. Rink himself...<br> will be here at the microphone.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Jordy is looking for Jett Rink.<br> What?<br> Where we had our hair done. Jordy wants<br> to fight Jett because it was his orders.<br> On account of Juana. The girl said<br> they didn't take wetbacks.<br> Stay here, honey, I'll be right back.<br> You invited me here to insult my wife.<br> You're gonna answer for it!<br> Ain't you the one who married the squaw?<br> What's the matter, boy?<br> Not having a good time?<br> Get them up, Rink! Everybody knows<br> you got this coming to you!<br> Jordy, no!<br> You want it in front of everybody,<br> or you want to come outside?<br> I don't care much whether it's here<br> or outside...<br> so long as I get one punch<br> at that stuck-up face of yours.<br> Sit down.<br> Governor.<br> How are you this evening?<br> And now, to introduce our guest of honor,<br> we hear from a man...<br> known from the rocky coast of Maine<br> to the Golden Gate in California.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, our own...<br> Senator Oliver Whiteside.<br> Get them up.<br> You had this coming to you<br> for a long time.<br> You'll get what you gave my boy.<br> Get them up.<br> Get them up!<br> ...proud, friendly...<br> warm-hearted, successful.<br> Yes, successful l am sure....<br> You ain't even worth hitting.<br> You want to know something true?<br> You're all through.<br> I'm going to ask you<br> to come with me tonight...<br> as l turn back the pages<br> in my book of happy memories...<br> and l recall the first time<br> l saw young Jett Rink.<br> -Where's the boy?<br> -Juana took Jordy upstairs.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> I'll go get Luz.<br> Come on, Luz. We're leaving.<br> Excuse me, please.<br> The years passed quickly...<br> as the years have a way of doing.<br> And now l see Jett Rink...<br> afraid of neither opposition<br> nor hard work...<br> his eyes set on the far distant...<br> goal toward which he's ever working...<br> planning, striving.<br> And now we come to Jett Rink, the man.<br> Texas has been kind to Jett Rink.<br> And Jett, never forgetting this kindness...<br> is ever ready to devote his resources...<br> to the greater glory of the state<br> which reared him...<br> which, in turn,<br> does honor to him tonight...<br> in this great gathering here present.<br> And now, my friends, here...<br> and to the thousands of you<br> listening across the nation...<br> l have the privilege, yes...<br> l have the great honor to introduce<br> a legend in his own time...<br> a great Texan...<br> an outstanding American!<br> Yes, my friends, a man!<br> l give to you Jett Rink!<br> You can count on me.<br> All right, goodbye.<br> How bad?<br> It hit pretty hard in Vientecito.<br> Dr. Guerra set up an auxiliary hospital.<br> He needs help. I've got to go there.<br> You'll make better time<br> if you wait till first light and fly.<br> I hate to spend the night under Jett's roof.<br> Me, too. If we weren't transporting<br> a circus, we'd all hightail it out of here.<br> I hope she doesn't let this<br> upset her too much.<br> This business tonight...<br> it's just one of those things.<br> The best thing to do is forget about it.<br> Go ahead and forget it.<br> Me, I'm going to remember it!<br> Now look, Jordy.<br> Take it easy.<br> We've had just about enough excitement<br> around here for one night.<br> Yeah, I guess so.<br> You've always had a mind of your own<br> and used it.<br> You've done things your own way.<br> You knew what you were doing<br> when you married in that direction.<br> I told you myself the morning<br> after you broke the news, remember?<br> I told you then that I knew<br> Juana was a mighty fine little gal...<br> but that marrying her was asking<br> for trouble. Remember?<br> I told you that.<br> Lots of folks in these parts<br> get pretty jumpy about that sort of thing.<br> Jett's only one of them.<br> I know those people. We've run<br> into this before. We're doing fine.<br> I'm concerned it has to do with the people<br> that ought to know better.<br> Like my own father.<br> Just the simple truth. That's you.<br> That's the way you think.<br> I don't care about Jett Rink,<br> but you, Papa, that's different.<br> Now you look here, Jordy!<br> You can't talk to me like that.<br> No man can!<br> I'm a fair man. I've been fair all my life,<br> with everybody!<br> And you, my own son,<br> can't tell me that I'm not a fair man!<br> Look, Jordy...<br> there's ways of living,<br> and there's ways of doing things...<br> that folks abide by when they want<br> to live right and happily...<br> in the comfort of their own people.<br> I always say that Juana is<br> a mighty fine gal, but--<br> Don't sit there and prove what I say!<br> I don't like to hear it!<br> You're not being fair!<br> When that ruckus started,<br> who went after Rink?<br> Your old man.<br> -Who took him to account? Your old man.<br> -And why?<br> Because of my wife?<br> -Yes!<br> -No!<br> Because your son, Jordan Benedict...<br> descendant of the long, proud line<br> of Reata...<br> got knocked flat on his back<br> in front of all of Texas. That's why!<br> Forget it. Don't worry yourself about it.<br> Mom, you made a mistake when you got<br> yourself mixed up with us rowdy Texans.<br> I'm shocked at you! I'm shocked<br> at all of us! I'm just so ashamed!<br> I'll never forget the sight of my brother<br> barging into the grand ballroom...<br> with all of our friends, disgracing us!<br> Then my father made it a bigger brawl!<br> How can I face people again?<br> If you keep seeing Jett,<br> you won't have to face me.<br> Children!<br> How about that anyway, Mom?<br> I haven't been asked.<br> It seems that my family<br> just can't tolerate his success.<br> My darling, Luz.<br> Tonight meant a lot to Jett. Really. I know.<br> If I only knew how to apologize to him,<br> I'd go to him now.<br> But I can't face all those people.<br> The party is over. They've all gone home.<br> He passed out like a light<br> in front of the whole crowd.<br> Oh, no!<br> That's what we heard, Luz.<br> He must have been ill.<br> Weak with shame or something.<br> He was plain drunk, if you'll forgive me.<br> I don't believe you.<br> The party broke up early,<br> but not a minute too soon.<br> Give me Mr. Rink's penthouse, please.<br> You're not going up there,<br> even if I have to sit on you!<br> It's important. Do you know where he is?<br> Luz, it's not like you<br> to make a fool of yourself.<br> I know where he is, honey.<br> Come along with Uncle Bawley.<br> All right, Luz. If you must go.<br> I must.<br> I've always held a strange power<br> over your mother.<br> I'm sorry, Mother.<br> What do you say, doll face?<br> About ready to come along with me?<br> It's time we hit the hay.<br> I give up.<br> Can we go to work now?<br> Leave him alone.<br> He owns the place, let him enjoy it.<br> Shut up.<br> Shut up!<br> Ladies and gentlemen<br> and distinguished guests.<br> I just want to count the blessings...<br> that this great domain<br> has bestowed upon her humble son.<br> My friends...<br> this is a man.<br> Old Mother Texas!<br> What did she give to me?<br> Not a goddamn thing.<br> You've got to work and sweat<br> and steal it from her.<br> But I got mine right out of the ground.<br> Poor Jett...<br> fighting for what's good.<br> Flunky!<br> Flunky for Bick Benedict...<br> her husband.<br> Poor Jett!<br> Poor pretty Leslie!<br> Pretty Leslie....<br> Pretty Leslie.<br> Wonderful, beautiful girl bride!<br> Poor boy.<br> Rich....<br> Rich Mrs. Benedict.<br> She's beautiful.<br> Lovely.<br> The woman a man wants.<br> A woman a man has got to have, too!<br> Thank you, Uncle Bawley.<br> Governor...<br> you know what you can do?<br> As soon as it lands, I'll sell it.<br> Good.<br> This is for me, boy.<br> The simple life.<br> No more of this highflying nonsense.<br> Juana, how does a hamburger<br> and a piece of pie sound to you?<br> Sounds very good.<br> No more of this highfalutin stuff.<br> Let's stop at this drive-in<br> and have us some chicken.<br> Then we can eat it with our fingers.<br> Nice place you have here. I've been<br> intending to stop every time I drove by.<br> Thank you.<br> What do you recommend?<br> How is the fried chicken?<br> Little Jordy wants ice cream, Grandpa.<br> Grandpa?<br> Ice cream it shall be.<br> Give the little fellow some ice cream.<br> Ice cream?<br> I thought that kid would want a tamale.<br> Give them what they want.<br> What do you say? Is this all right?<br> It's good.<br> After all that fancy food and high living.<br> This is the life.<br> Hey, you.<br> The plane should arrive in Benedict<br> around 1 :30.<br> You're in the wrong place.<br> Come on, let's get out of here.<br> Your money is no good here.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> You, too.<br> Hold on a minute.<br> Yes, what do you want?<br> Look here, Sarge. I'd sure appreciate it<br> if you were more polite to these people.<br> You would, eh?<br> I'm Bick Benedict.<br> Your neighbor, you might say.<br> Does that give you special privileges?<br> The name Benedict's meant something<br> to people around here for a long time.<br> That there papoose down there...<br> is his name Benedict, too?<br> Yes. Come to think of it, it is.<br> Forget I asked you.<br> Go sit down,<br> and we ain't gonna have no trouble.<br> But this bunch's gonna eat<br> somewhere else.<br> All right, come on. Let's go.<br> Come on, you, too.<br> You're out of line, mister.<br> Is that the best<br> that old horse thief can do?<br> He's feeling your mood, darling.<br> There's a lot of Clair de Lune<br> in both of you old fire-eaters.<br> You're both rather gentle creatures.<br> How awful!<br> Those kids....<br> Look at them.<br> Those kids, in their infinite wisdom,<br> are smarter than we are.<br> They know I'm a disgrace.<br> And they don't hesitate to say so.<br> Even the calf's got my number.<br> I don't have to take it from a sheep!<br> Now, Jordan!<br> Hello, Vashti. We're all fine.<br> How'd you make it back?<br> -They all made it back in one piece.<br> -Jolly.<br> Yes, all our guests have finally gone.<br> Thank goodness!<br> But more have left than we bargained for.<br> Luz has gone on to Hollywood with Lola,<br> whatever the name was.<br> She decided she would like to see<br> how she liked Hollywood.<br> We never had one in the family.<br> Good Lord, an actress!<br> All you can do is raise them.<br> You can't live their lives for them.<br> Judy and Bob are out looking at a ranch.<br> A small one.<br> Jordy and Juana are gonna move<br> into Vientecito.<br> And we, we're home minding the babies.<br> The sun's going down over the yardarm.<br> When are you going to open up the bar?<br> Anytime. Go ahead.<br> Remember, one of these days<br> that bourbon's gonna kill you.<br> Okay. It'll be me or it.<br> One of us has got to go.<br> I'm going to stay right here.<br> It's coming onto spring.<br> Roundup time is no time<br> to be away from Reata.<br> Honey, everybody's on the move.<br> The strays are leaving the herd.<br> I wouldn't mind it too much if you wanted<br> to pack up and go back home for a spell.<br> Home?<br> Where do you think I've been<br> this last breathless quarter of a century?<br> Home.<br> Look, boy, I belong here!<br> You really want to know<br> what's gotten my goat?<br> My own grandson doesn't even look<br> like one of us.<br> He really looks like a little wetback.<br> Little muchacho fires up, don't he?<br> I'm sorry, Jordan Benedict IV.<br> There's times when a man<br> just has to be honest.<br> You know something, Leslie?<br> There's no use kidding.<br> I'm a failure.<br> Nothing has turned out like I had planned.<br> I just feel like my saddle's turning<br> right out from under me.<br> Do you want to know something?<br> I think you're great!<br> Don't ask me why.<br> Some things are difficult to explain.<br> You know all that fine riding<br> you used to do, and all that fancy roping...<br> and all that glamor stuff<br> you did to dazzle me?<br> It was impressive.<br> But none of it ever made you<br> quite as big a man to me...<br> as you were on the floor<br> of Sarge's hamburger joint.<br> When you tumbled rearward...<br> and landed crashing<br> into that pile of dirty dishes...<br> you were at last my hero.<br> That's what you always wanted to be.<br> Could be.<br> When we went into that place,<br> before the fight started....<br> What a fight! It was glorious!<br> Before we went in,<br> I was feeling like you are now.<br> I was thinking to myself:<br> " Well...<br> " Jordan and I, and the others behind us,<br> have been failures."<br> And then it happened.<br> You wound up on the floor, on your back,<br> in the middle of the salad.<br> And I said to myself:<br> " Well...<br> " after 100 years...<br> " the Benedict family...<br> " is a real big success."<br> You want to know something, Leslie?<br> If I live to be 90...<br> I'll never be able to figure you out.<br>
