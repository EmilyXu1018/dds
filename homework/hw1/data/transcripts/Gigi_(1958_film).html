But it isn't.<br> It's about one in particular.<br> That one.<br> Her name is Gigi.<br> Gigi!<br> What you have to look forward to!<br> Those little eyes<br> So helpless and appealing<br> One day will flash and send you<br> Crashing through the ceiling<br> Thank heaven<br> For little girls<br> Thank heaven for them all<br> No matter where<br> No matter who<br> Without them<br> What would little boys do?<br> Thank heaven<br> Thank heaven<br> Thank heaven<br> For little girls!<br> Hello, Grandmama.<br> Gigi, where have you been?<br> Playing in the park.<br> I had to, Grandmama.<br> My foot fell asleep in class.<br> It wouldn't wake up.<br> Did you forget what day it is?<br> It's Tuesday.<br> Aunt Alicia!<br> Well, I'd better run.<br> You cannot go to your Aunt Alicia's<br> looking like that.<br> Put your coat on.<br> Let me comb your hair.<br> Yes, Grandmama.<br> I hate this coat.<br> It makes my legs feel so long.<br> Yes, your legs are long.<br> You know...<br> ...sometimes I'm sorry<br> you never learned to dance.<br> But I want to, Grandmama.<br> Why don't you let me take lessons?<br> No. Not the same mistake twice.<br> Your mother took singing lessons,<br> and look where she ended up.<br> Slaving away at the Opra-Comique<br> in ridiculous little roles.<br> - She seems happy.<br> - Happy!<br> I went to see her one night.<br> I couldn't even find her.<br> In the first act...<br> ...she was behind a tree.<br> In the second act...<br> ...behind a tenor.<br> Mama's awake.<br> Isn't it early?<br> She's on this afternoon.<br> If I Were King.<br> That's more than she does<br> in the whole opera.<br> And when I think of<br> that delightful old gentleman...<br> ...with all those flour mills.<br> Who?<br> Nothing.<br> You go to school every morning.<br> You see your Aunt Alicia once a week.<br> That's all the lessons you need.<br> When the time comes,<br> you'll be ready.<br> Ready for what, Grandmama?<br> Enough. Now run.<br> - Goodbye, Grandmama.<br> - Goodbye, Gigi.<br> - More powerful, monsieur.<br> Sixty kilometers an hour!<br> There's nothing faster on the road,<br> monsieur. Not here or in America.<br> Your uncle is here, monsieur.<br> Of course, the smaller is<br> a first-rate machine, monsieur.<br> Naturally, the larger one<br> is more expensive.<br> I'd be happy to<br> demonstrate both.<br> I beg your pardon, Monsieur Gaston.<br> Your father wanted me to ask you...<br> ...did you, by any chance, buy the<br> Paris-Lyon-Mditerrane Railroad?<br> The Paris-Lyon-Md...?<br> Yes, yes, I did.<br> According to this morning's<br> opening at la Bourse...<br> ...it's gone up 12 points.<br> I thought it would.<br> Monsieur Lachaille, about the car.<br> Send it over in the morning<br> with the bill.<br> Yes, monsieur. Thank you.<br> But which one?<br> My dear fellow, I don't care.<br> Either one.<br> I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Uncle.<br> Why didn't you come upstairs?<br> I was afraid I'd meet<br> my brother and sister-in-law.<br> - You would have.<br> - I have to tell you...<br> ...your parents bore me to death.<br> - Me too.<br> - But I've known them longer...<br> ...so they've been boring me longer.<br> After you.<br> Your father is actually quite unique.<br> He was a bore at the age of 5.<br> All he has to say is, "Hello,"<br> and I can barely keep my eyes open.<br> Armenonville.<br> I waited for you at the embassy<br> last Sunday. What happened?<br> The thought of another embassy tea<br> paralyzed me.<br> Instead, I had tea with an old friend<br> Madame Alvarez.<br> - Madame Alvarez?<br> - Yes, you know her.<br> Or knew her once, didn't you?<br> - Does she say I did?<br> - I think she's mentioned it.<br> Then I suppose I did.<br> It's the one place in Paris<br> where I can go and relax.<br> Whose luncheon are you<br> taking me to today?<br> Henri Trouvre.<br> We have to go.<br> I'm meeting a heavenly creature there.<br> You're still young, Uncle, aren't you?<br> Not compared to her.<br> But I must say,<br> I am compared to you.<br> Maybe it's the women you go with.<br> How old is Liane?<br> About 30.<br> That may be it.<br> Youth is the thing, Gaston.<br> Youth!<br> Stay close to the young...<br> ...and a little rubs off.<br> I'm bored.<br> Bored?<br> Look at all the captivating<br> Fascinating things there are to do<br> Name two<br> Look at all the pleasures<br> All the myriad of treasures<br> We have got<br> Like what?<br> Look at Paris in the spring<br> When each solitary thing<br> Is more beautiful than ever before<br> You can hear every tree<br> Almost saying, "Look at me!"<br> - What color are the trees?<br> - Green!<br> - What color were they last year?<br> - Green!<br> - And next year?<br> - Green!<br> It's a bore<br> Don't you marvel at the power<br> Of the mighty Eiffel Tower<br> Knowing there it will remain evermore<br> Climbing up to the sky<br> Over 90 stories high<br> - How many stories?<br> - Ninety!<br> - How many yesterday?<br> - Ninety!<br> - And tomorrow?<br> - Ninety!<br> It's a bore!<br> The river Seine<br> All it can do is flow<br> But think of wine<br> It's red or white<br> - But think of girls<br> - It's either yes or no<br> And if it's no or if it's yes<br> It simply couldn't matter less<br> But think of a race<br> With your horse in seventh place<br> Then he suddenly begins<br> And he catches up and wins<br> With a roar!<br> It's a bore!<br> Life is thrilling as can be<br> Simply not my cup of tea<br> It's a gay, romantic fling<br> If you like that sort of thing<br> - It's intriguing<br> - It's fatiguing<br> It's a game<br> It's the same dull world<br> Wherever you go<br> Whatever place you are at<br> The Earth is round<br> But everything on it is flat<br> Don't tell me<br> Venice has no lure<br> Just a town without a sewer<br> The Leaning Tower I adore<br> Indecision is a bore<br> But think of the thrill<br> Of a bullfight in Seville<br> When the bull is uncontrolled<br> And he charges at the bold matador!<br> It's a bore!<br> Think of lunch beneath the trees<br> Stop the carriage, if you please<br> You mean you don't want to come?<br> The thought of lunch leaves me numb<br> But I implore<br> Oh, no, Uncle.<br> It's a bore!<br> Goodbye, Honor.<br> Come in.<br> - Mamita.<br> - Gaston!<br> What a wonderful surprise.<br> How do you feel today, dear Mamita?<br> Fine, Gaston.<br> And the better for seeing you.<br> You've gotten a trifle thinner,<br> and it's most becoming.<br> - You think so?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Come and sit down.<br> In your chair.<br> Thank you.<br> What beautiful material.<br> Very chic!<br> Just the sort of thing<br> Honor used to wear.<br> A bit more conservative, perhaps.<br> Would you like a sweet?<br> No, thank you. But I would love a cup<br> of your chamomile tea.<br> But of course.<br> More than just one, I hope.<br> Do you have a telephone yet, Mamita?<br> No, not yet.<br> Not until Gigi is old enough<br> to have secrets and admirers.<br> But there's one upstairs<br> if it's important.<br> It's not important.<br> Gigi's not at home?<br> No. This is Tuesday.<br> The day she has luncheon<br> with her aunt Alicia.<br> How is your sister?<br> I haven't seen her for quite a while.<br> I don't wonder.<br> She never sets foot out of<br> her apartment or her past.<br> And quite a past it was...<br> ...so she says.<br> According to the stories<br> Honor tells me...<br> ...what she says is quite true.<br> Aren't you afraid of<br> her influence on Gigi?<br> Not at all.<br> She finds Gigi a trifle backward...<br> ...which is true...<br> ...and she educates her.<br> Educates her?<br> Last week, she taught her<br> to eat cold lobster...<br> ...to perfection.<br> What in heaven's name for?<br> She says it's extremely useful.<br> Marvelous.<br> It's so good to be here.<br> It's always a pleasure<br> to watch the rich...<br> ...enjoying the comforts of the poor.<br> Especially you, dear Gaston.<br> How does your sister look?<br> Still as young as ever?<br> Yes, Alicia is always the same.<br> Living in the past<br> must agree with her.<br> When I think...<br> ...it was in...<br> ...1859...<br> ...she went off with her first sultan.<br> Then came her Duke of Milan...<br> ...her King of Spain,<br> her khedive, her maharajah.<br> She's remarkable looking...<br> Good day, Charles.<br> Mademoiselle.<br> What are we having for lunch?<br> Ortolans.<br> Oh, dear!<br> Are they difficult?<br> Slowly, Gigi. Slowly.<br> The racing season is over.<br> Good day, Aunt Alicia.<br> Now let's go into luncheon.<br> Yes, Aunt Alicia.<br> Today you will learn to eat ortolans.<br> What are ortolans, Aunt?<br> Exquisite little birds.<br> Most people attack them like cannibals.<br> You must learn to eat them properly.<br> Bad table manners...<br> ...have broken up more households<br> than infidelity.<br> Did you work hard in school today?<br> What did you study?<br> History.<br> Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.<br> How depressing.<br> - What else?<br> - English.<br> English?<br> I suppose we must.<br> They refuse to learn French.<br> Who are your friends?<br> Ortolans should be cut in two<br> with a quick stroke of the knife.<br> There must be no grating<br> of the blade on the plate.<br> Now bite up each piece.<br> The bones don't matter.<br> Go on eating while you<br> answer my questions.<br> But don't talk with your mouth full.<br> Well, you can do it.<br> If I can do it, you can.<br> What friends have you made?<br> None.<br> I'm always on my own.<br> Why does Grandmama stop me<br> from accepting invitations?<br> She's right for once.<br> You'd only be invited<br> by ordinary people.<br> What about us?<br> Aren't we ordinary people?<br> Why are we different?<br> They have weak heads<br> and careless bodies.<br> Besides, they are married.<br> But I don't think you would understand.<br> Oh, yes, Aunt, I understand.<br> We don't marry,<br> is that it?<br> Marriage is not forbidden to us.<br> But instead of<br> getting married at once...<br> ...it sometimes happens<br> we get married...<br> ...at last.<br> Enough. We must finish lunch<br> and get on with your lessons.<br> Now, go on.<br> Go on, go on!<br> Without knowledge ofjewelry,<br> my dear Gigi...<br> ...a woman is lost.<br> Do you remember Madame Dunard,<br> who was here the other day?<br> Did you notice that rope<br> of black pearls around her throat?<br> Yes!

Time does not<br> stand still for all of us, Honor.<br> Don't be nervous!<br> Gaston is such a dear man.<br> So sweet of him to bring<br> little Gigi and show her Trouville.<br> She's having a glorious time.<br> And so is Gaston.<br> I haven't seen him<br> this chipper in years.<br> We had good times too...<br> ...didn't we?<br> Come to think of it,<br> those last days we spent together...<br> ...were by the sea, weren't they?<br> Were they?<br> Of course they were.<br> On the Riviera.<br> The pink villa.<br> - I only remember the blue villa.<br> - Which was that?<br> The one belonging to the soprano.<br> You knew.<br> But of course.<br> But I thought you left me<br> because of that Austrian count.<br> But of course.<br> But you didn't.<br> I'll tell you about<br> that blue villa, Mamita.<br> I was so much in love,<br> I wanted to marry you.<br> Yes, it's true.<br> I was beginning to think of marriage.<br> Imagine!<br> Marriage, me.<br> No. I was really desperate.<br> I had to do something.<br> And what I did was the soprano.<br> Thank you, Honor.<br> That is the most charming and endearing<br> excuse for infidelity...<br> ...that I've ever heard.<br> But I've never forgotten you.<br> Not the last evening we spent together.<br> I can remember everything<br> as if it were yesterday.<br> We met at 9<br> We met at 8<br> I was on time<br> No, you were late<br> Ah, yes<br> I remember it well<br> We dined with friends<br> We dined alone<br> A tenor sang<br> A baritone<br> Ah, yes<br> I remember it well<br> That dazzling April moon<br> There was none that night<br> And the month was June<br> That's right<br> That's right<br> It warms my heart<br> To know that you<br> Remember still<br> The way you do<br> Ah, yes<br> I remember it well<br> - How often I've thought of that Friday...<br> - Monday<br> - night, when we had<br> Our last rendezvous<br> And somehow I foolishly<br> Wondered if you might<br> By some chance<br> Be thinking of it too<br> That carriage ride<br> You walked me home<br> You lost a glove<br> I lost a comb<br> Ah, yes<br> I remember it well<br> That brilliant sky<br> We had some rain<br> Those Russian songs<br> From sunny Spain?<br> Ah, yes<br> I remember it well<br> You wore a gown of gold<br> I was all in blue<br> Am I getting old?<br> Oh, no<br> Not you<br> How strong you were<br> How young and gay<br> A prince of love<br> In every way<br> Ah, yes<br> I remember it well<br> - Where is she?<br> - In the salon, madame.<br> What's happened?<br> What's so important you couldn't<br> tell me on the telephone?<br> We have serious matters to discuss.<br> Collect yourself.<br> I doubt if I'll ever be able to.<br> Serious matters about what?<br> About Gigi.<br> You were at Trouville over the weekend<br> with Gaston Lachaille.<br> It was a dreadful mistake.<br> Dreadful mistake?<br> What are you talking about, Alicia?<br> My dear sister...<br> ...has it ever occurred<br> to you that Gigi...?<br> Well?<br> Gigi?<br> Yes, Gigi.<br> It isn't possible.<br> Not if it's ruined at the<br> beginning through lack of tact.<br> And when did I display any lack of tact?<br> It was a most congenial weekend.<br> So congenial that Gaston returned,<br> canceled all engagements...<br> ...and left Paris that same evening<br> for Monte Carlo.<br> He did?<br> For how long?<br> For what they describe as<br> an extended stay.<br> But why?<br> It doesn't matter why.<br> It may be a blessing in disguise.<br> It gives us time.<br> Time for what?<br> For Gigi's lessons, of course.<br> See to it that she's here every day.<br> Do you really think...?<br> It's a chance.<br> But a chance that we must take.<br> From now on, dear sister...<br> ...it's work, work, work...<br> ...lessons, lessons, lessons.<br> Pick up the coffeepot with one hand<br> and the cup and saucer with the other.<br> Always both.<br> Never the coffeepot alone.<br> Like this, Aunt?<br> Your grip on the saucer<br> must be firm...<br> ...but not obviously so.<br> The saucer must seem so much<br> a part of your fingers...<br> ...that one would think<br> it could only be removed by surgery.<br> Now pour...<br> ...and be sure the coffeepot is upright<br> before you take the cup away.<br> There must be no drops.<br> Now give it to me.<br> I don't take any, but be sure and<br> always ask about cream and sugar.<br> Now serve yourself.<br> And remember the firm grip.<br> No, the coffeepot first!<br> Now, you will try it once more.<br> Remember, you will go<br> to the door properly...<br> ...turn, walk in properly<br> and sit down properly.<br> Now, go on.<br> And not like a marionette.<br> Keep your shoulders level.<br> Now turn...<br> ...walk back and sit down.<br> And don't flop into the chair.<br> Insinuate yourself.<br> That's better.<br> Now rise and exit the same way.<br> Don't jump up!<br> Ascend!<br> Now, you hold the glass like this.<br> Charles, some more wine<br> for mademoiselle.<br> Watch me.<br> Try it.<br> Don't gulp it!<br> Sip it. A little at a time.<br> Fill mademoiselle's glass, Charles.<br> That's better.<br> You have to fully enjoy the aroma.<br> Hold your first sip on the roof<br> of your mouth for a moment...<br> ...and breathe through your nose.<br> Then you will feel the flavor.<br> Did you feel the perfume?<br> - No.<br> - Try it again.<br> A bad year will be sharp.<br> A good year, which this is,<br> of course, will waft.<br> Marvelous!<br> That will be all, Charles.<br> Hello, Grandma...<br> Hello, Gigi.<br> Come in.<br> How good to see you.<br> I have a present for...<br> What's the matter with her?<br> Everything.<br> Don't you look well!<br> Did you have a nice trip?<br> How was Monte Carlo this year?<br> Well, the sea is blue.<br> The palm trees are green.<br> The sun is yellow.<br> It all makes a lovely post card.<br> Just as it should be.<br> Actually, it's a bore.<br> One has to be as rich as you<br> to be bored at Monte Carlo.<br> I brought Gigi some caramels.<br> Really, Gaston,<br> you spoil her too much.<br> Would you like a cup of chamomile tea?<br> Please. Please, Mamita.<br> Look, Gaston.<br> Four yards of material in the skirt.<br> Well, don't I look great ladyish?<br> You look like<br> an organ-grinder's monkey!<br> An organ-grinder's monkey?<br> What happened to your<br> little Scotch dress?<br> And that ridiculous collar!<br> And what's wrong with that collar?<br> It makes you look like<br> a giraffe with a goiter.<br> With all the talk<br> there is about you, Gaston...<br> ...l've never heard it said<br> you had any taste in clothes.<br> Have you gone mad? How dare you<br> speak to Gaston like that?<br> Apologize.<br> Apologize at once!<br> I certainly will not.<br> This is a beautiful dress.<br> Gaston, please.<br> I beg of you, wait.<br> She'll apologize.<br> Is this the education she gets<br> from you and your sister?<br> My congratulations to you both.<br> What have you done?<br> Why did he fly off the handle?<br> He knew I'd answer him back.<br> You ungrateful little thing.<br> How can you be rude to Gaston<br> when he's been so good to us?<br> And just when<br> we were trying so hard...<br> ...to make an elegant<br> young lady out of you.<br> To show you off<br> to your best advantage.<br> You must admit, one doesn't have to<br> turn oneself inside out...<br> ...for an old friend like Gaston.<br> It's silly.<br> It's absolutely silly.<br> I've decided your new dress<br> may not be as bad as all that.<br> I didn't see it properly,<br> and perhaps I was a bit cruel.<br> To prove it,<br> I'll take you for a drive...<br> ...for tea at the Reservoirs<br> in Versailles.<br> - Would you like that?<br> - I'd love it!<br> Gaston wants to take me<br> to tea at the Reservoirs.<br> You've come back, Gaston.<br> How tolerant you are.<br> I hadn't really gone.<br> We're going to tea<br> at the Reservoirs.<br> No, you're not.<br> I'm sorry, Gaston.<br> What do you mean?<br> Grandmama, please.<br> Gigi, go to your room<br> for a moment.<br> I have to talk to Gaston<br> about something.<br> No, Grandmama.<br> Gigi, do as you're told.<br> Mamita, what does this mean?<br> Something has changed here lately.<br> I can feel it.<br> Sit down, Gaston.<br> Please.<br> Gaston, you know my friendship for you.<br> My friendship and my gratitude.<br> But I must not forget my duty.<br> Gigi's mother has neither the time<br> nor the mind to take care of her.<br> And Gigi isn't just another girl.<br> She's special.<br> Of course.<br> For years, you've been giving her<br> candies and trinkets...<br> ...and she adores you.<br> Now you want to take her in your<br> automobile to the Reservoirs for tea.<br> If it were just you and I,<br> I would say:<br> "Take Gigi wherever you want."<br> I would trust her with you anywhere.<br> But there are others, Gaston.<br> You are known everywhere.<br> For a woman to<br> go out with you alone now...<br> ...with the eyes of Paris on you...<br> Are you trying to make me believe...<br> ...that if Gigi goes out with me,<br> she'll be compromised?<br> Let us say she would be labeled.<br> A young girl who goes out with you<br> is no longer an ordinary young girl.<br> Not even a respectable young girl.<br> Mamita, this is absurd.<br> As far as you are concerned,<br> it would be just another news item.<br> But in this case, I would not<br> have the heart to laugh...<br> ...when I read it in the newspapers.<br> This is too ridiculous<br> to discuss any further.<br> I don't want to contradict you,<br> and I don't want to argue about it.<br> If you feel you're protecting Gigi<br> from some cruel fate...<br> ...that's your affair.<br> I understand responsibility to Gigi<br> better than you.<br> I'll do all I can to entrust her<br> only to a man who'll be able to say:<br> "I'll take care of her.<br> I'll answer for her future."<br> Now, can I get you<br> your chamomile tea, Gaston?<br> No, thank you.<br> I have an appointment...<br> ...and I'm late already.<br> But forgive me if I wonder, madame...<br> ...whom you are keeping her for?<br> Some underpaid bank clerk...<br> ...who'll marry her and give her<br> four children in three years?<br> You're upset.<br> Please...<br> To see her married in white in<br> a dingy little church to a plumber...<br> ...who'll only give her<br> a worthless name...<br> ...and the squalor of good intentions?<br> Very well, madame.<br> Very well!<br> If that's your ambition...<br> ...inflict your misery<br> in the name of respectability.<br> I pity you!<br> I pity you all!<br> Upset!<br> What utter rubbish!<br> Pierre...<br> ...do I look upset?<br> Yes, monsieur, you do.<br> Upset!<br> Upset indeed!<br> She's a babe<br> Just a babe<br> Still cavorting in her crib<br> Eating breakfast with a bib<br> With her baby teeth<br> And all her baby curls<br> She's a tot<br> Just a tot<br> Good for bouncing on your knee<br> I am positive that she<br> Doesn't even know<br> That boys aren't girls<br> She's a snip<br> Just a snip<br> Making dreadful baby noise<br> Having fun with all her toys<br> Just a chickadee<br> Who needs a mother hen<br> She's a cub, a papoose<br> You could never turn her loose<br> She's too infantile<br> To take her from her pen<br> Of course, that weekend in Trouville<br> In spite of all her youthful zeal<br> She was exceedingly polite<br> And on the whole, a sheer delight<br> And if it wasn't joy galore<br> At least not once was she a bore<br> That I recall<br> No, not at all<br> She's a child<br> A silly child<br> Adolescent to her toes<br> And good heaven, how it shows<br> Sticky thumbs are all the fingers<br> She has got<br> She's a child<br> A clumsy child<br> She's as swollen as a grape<br> And she doesn't have a shape<br> Where her figure ought to be<br> It is not!<br> Just a child<br> A growing child<br> But so backward for her years<br> If a boy her age appears<br> I am certain<br> He will never call again<br> She's a scamp and a brat<br> Doesn't know where she is at<br> Unequipped and undesirable to men<br> Of course, I must in truth confess<br> That in her brand-new little dress<br> She looked surprisingly mature<br> And had a definite allure<br> It was a shock, in fact, to me<br> A most amazing shock to see<br> The way it clung<br> On one so young<br> She's a girl<br> A little girl<br> Getting older, it is true<br> Which is what they always do<br> Till that unexpected hour<br> When they blossom like a flower<br> Oh, no.<br> Oh, no.<br> But...<br> There's sweeter music<br> When she speaks<br> Isn't there?<br> A different bloom<br> About her cheeks<br> Isn't there?<br> Could I be wrong?<br> Could it be so?<br> Oh, where<br> Oh, where did Gigi go?<br> Gigi<br> Am I a fool without a mind?<br> Or have I merely been too blind<br> To realize?<br> Oh, Gigi<br> Why, you've been growing up<br> Before my eyes<br> Gigi!<br> You're not at all<br> That funny, awkward little girl<br> I knew<br> Oh, no<br> Overnight<br> There's been<br> A breathless change<br> In you<br> Oh, Gigi<br> While you were trembling<br> On the brink<br> Was I out yonder somewhere<br> Blinking at a star?<br> Oh, Gigi<br> Have I been standing up too close<br> Or back too far?<br> When did your sparkle<br> Turn to fire?<br> And your warmth<br> Become desire?<br> Oh, what miracle<br> Has made you the way you are?<br> Gigi!<br> Gigi!<br> Gigi!<br> Oh, no<br> I was mad not to have seen<br> The change in you<br> Oh, Gigi!<br> While you were trembling<br> On the brink<br> Was I out yonder somewhere<br> Blinking at a star?<br> Oh, Gigi<br> Have I been standing up too close<br> Or back to far?<br> When did your sparkle<br> Turn to fire?<br> And your warmth<br> Become desire?<br> Oh, what miracle<br> Has made you the way<br> You are?<br> Mamita, are you alone?<br> Good. I have an important<br> business matter to discuss with you.<br> Now, let us recapitulate.<br> To begin with, he said she would<br> be spoiled as no other...<br> He said she would be spoiled<br> as no other woman has been before.<br> It's all right, but it's vague.<br> I like everything spelled out.<br> Did he say precisely<br> where she would live?<br> He said a suitable house<br> on the Avenue du Bois.<br> - You're sure?<br> - Of course.<br> Well, very good.<br> Servants?<br> Yes, he mentioned servants.<br> What about an automobile?<br> I think so. I'm not quite sure.<br> She must have an automobile<br> and a chauffeur.<br> I'm sure he didn't mean<br> to be evasive or ungenerous.<br> He suggested that you and I<br> and our lawyer...<br> ...meet at his lawyer tomorrow<br> and draw it up in detail.<br> You call him and tell him to<br> bring his lawyer to our lawyer.<br> We'll draw it up in detail.<br> You mustn't be suspicious, Alicia.<br> - Gigi doesn't know yet?<br> - How could she?<br> He just left. But he wants to<br> have dinner with her this evening.<br> When you speak to Gigi,<br> be sure and stress...<br> ...the difficulties of the situation,<br> not the delights.<br> The role she will have to play.<br> She's a naive, thoughtless girl.<br> You must warn her not to<br> ask for the moon.<br> Not only will he not give it...<br> Don't worry about her.<br> You think she's like you.<br> Actually, you don't know her.<br> There's no meanness in her at all.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I mean, she has no material ambition.<br> I understand. He should<br> send a present before tonight.<br> Let me know what it is.<br> Yes, I will.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> You know why I'm here?<br> Yes, I know.<br> Do you want to...<br> ...or don't you?<br> I don't want to.<br> I don't know what you want.<br> You told Grandmama...<br> I know what I told your grandmother.<br> We don't have to repeat it.<br> Just tell me simply what<br> you don't want...<br> ...and tell me what you do want.<br> Do you mean that?<br> Of course.<br> You told Grandmama that<br> you wanted to take care of me.<br> To take care of you beautifully.<br> Beautifully.<br> That is, if I like it.<br> They've pounded into my head<br> I'm backward for my age...<br> ...but I know what all this means.<br> To take care of me beautifully<br> means I shall go away with you...<br> ...and that I shall sleep in your bed.<br> Please, Gigi.<br> I beg of you, you embarrass me.<br> You weren't embarrassed to<br> talk to Grandmama about it.<br> And Grandmama wasn't embarrassed<br> to talk to me about it.<br> But I know more than she told me.<br> To take care of me...<br> ...means that I shall have<br> my photograph in the papers.<br> That I shall go to the Riviera.<br> To the races at Deauville.<br> And when we fight, it will<br> be in all the columns the next day.<br> And when you'd give me up,<br> as you did with Ins des Cvennes.<br> Who's been filling your head<br> with all these old stories?<br> How do you know about that?<br> Why shouldn't I know?<br> You're world famous.<br> I know about the woman<br> who stole from you.<br> The contessa<br> who wanted to shoot you.<br> The American who wanted to marry you.<br> I know what everybody knows.<br> These aren't the things<br> we have to talk about together.<br> That's all in the past,<br> over and done with.<br> Yes, Gaston.<br> Until it begins again.<br> It's not your fault<br> you're world famous.<br> It's just that I haven't got<br> a world famous sort of nature.<br> When it's over, Gaston Lachaille<br> goes off with another lady.<br> And I have only to go into<br> another gentleman's bed.<br> That won't do for me.<br> I'm not changeable.<br> That won't do for me.<br> Grandmama and Aunt Alicia are on<br> your side, but this concerns me too.<br> And I think I should have<br> something to say about it.<br> And what I say is, it won't work.<br> It won't work!<br> Are you trying to find a way<br> to tell me that I don't please you?<br> That you don't like me?<br> Oh, no, Gaston!<br> Oh, no. I do like you.<br> I'm so happy when I'm with you.<br> Gaston, couldn't we go on<br> just as we are?<br> Maybe seeing each other<br> a little more often?<br> You're a friend of the family.<br> Nobody would think anything of it.<br> You could go on bringing me<br> licorice and caramels...<br> ...and champagne on my birthday.<br> And on Sundays, we can have<br> an extra special game of cards.<br> Wouldn't that be<br> a lovely little life?<br> A wonderful little life.<br> Except that you forget one thing:<br> I'm in love with you.<br> You never told me.<br> I haven't known it very long.<br> I discovered it<br> when I was away from you.<br> In Monte Carlo.<br> You are a wicked man.<br> You're in love with me...<br> ...and you want to drag me into a life<br> that will make me suffer!<br> You think nothing of exposing me<br> to all sorts of terrible adventures...<br> ...ending in quarrels, separations...<br> ...pistol shots,<br> Sandomirs and poison!<br> Please listen to me!<br> I should never have<br> believed this of you. Never!<br> What's the matter?<br> What's happened?<br> She doesn't seem to want to.<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean she doesn't want to!<br> Are you going out of your mind?<br> As God is my witness,<br> I explained it to her. Believe me.<br> You explained too much!<br> You've trained her to know<br> nothing but the sordid and the vulgar.<br> But what about kindness,<br> sweetness, benevolence?<br> What of the tender heart<br> bulging with generosity?<br> These things exist too, madame.<br> Or have you never heard of them?<br> Uncle! I'll tell you...<br> ...Europe is breeding a generation<br> of vandals and ingrates.<br> Children are coming<br> into the world...<br> ...with ice-covered souls<br> and hatchets in their hands!<br> And before they have finished, they'll<br> smash everything beautiful and decent.<br> Have a piece of cheese.<br> No, thank you.<br> I envy you, Uncle.<br> I envy you, your age.<br> For you, it was different.<br> You've been clean and good,<br> and it's been appreciated.<br> But not anymore.<br> It's over. All over.<br> I'm sorry to hear it.<br> A little salad?<br> No, thank you.<br> Imagine this if you can:<br> Here is a girl, living in<br> a moldy apartment, decaying walls...<br> ...worm-ridden furniture,<br> surrounded by filth.<br> You're ruining my lunch.<br> Nothing to look forward to<br> but abject poverty.<br> My heart was touched.<br> I wanted to help her.<br> I offered her everything:<br> House, car, servants, clothes...<br> ...and me.<br> And?<br> She turned me down.<br> - Turned you down?<br> - Turned me down.<br> It's impossible.<br> It's not impossible.<br> It just happened.<br> Obviously, that disgusting apartment<br> she lives in has driven her mad.<br> Her grandmother was delighted.<br> - Grandmother?<br> - Yes, Mamita.<br> But Gigi...<br> No, no, no.
