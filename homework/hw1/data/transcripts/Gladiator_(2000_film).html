He'll pour a honeyed<br> potion in your ear...<br> and you'll wake up one day,<br> and all you'll say is,<br> " Republic, republic, republic."<br> Well, why not?<br> Rome was founded as a republic.<br> Yes, and in a republic<br> the senate has the power.<br> But Senator Gaius isn't<br> influenced by that, of course.<br> Where do you stand, General?<br> Emperor or senate?<br> The soldier has the advantage<br> of being able to look<br> his enemy in the eye, Senator.<br> Well, with an army behind you,<br> you could be extremely political.<br> I warned you.<br> Now I shall save you.

Three!<br> Four!<br> One! Two!<br> You sent for me, Caesar?<br> Caesar?<br> Tell me again, Maximus.<br> Why are we here?<br> For the glory<br> of the Empire, sire.<br> Ah, yes.<br> Ah, yes, I remember.<br> Do you see that map,<br> Maximus?<br> That is the world<br> which I created.<br> For25years...<br> I have conquered, spilt blood,<br> expanded the Empire.<br> Since I became caesar,<br> I've known four years without war.<br> Four years of peace in 20.<br> And for what?<br> I brought the sword.<br> Nothing more.<br> Caesar, your life-<br> Please.<br> Please don't call me that.<br> Come. Please.<br> Come sit.<br> Let us talk together now-<br> very simply-as men.<br> Maximus... talk.<br> Five thousand of my men<br> are out there in the freezing mud.<br> Three thousand of them<br> are bloodied and cleaved.<br> Two thousand will never<br> leave this place.<br> I will not believe that they<br> fought and died for nothing.<br> And what would you<br> believe, Maximus?<br> They fought for you...<br> and for Rome.<br> And what is Rome,<br> Maximus?<br> I've seen much of<br> the rest of the world.<br> It is brutal and cruel and dark.<br> Rome is the light.<br> Yet you have<br> never been there.<br> You have not seen<br> what it has become.<br> I am dying, Maximus.<br> When a man sees his end,<br> he wants to know there was<br> some purpose this life.<br> How will the world speak my name<br> in years to come?<br> Will I be known<br> as the philosopher?<br> The warrior?<br> The tyrant?<br> Or will I be the emperor who<br> gave Rome back her true self?<br> There was once a dream<br> that was Rome.<br> You could only<br> whisper it.<br> Anything more than a whisper<br> and it would vanish.<br> It was so fragile.<br> And I fear that it will not<br> survive the winter.<br> Maximus,<br> Let us whisper now,<br> together, you and l.<br> You have a son.<br> Tell me about your home.<br> My house is in the hills above Tiujillo.<br> A very simple place.<br> Pinkstones<br> that warm in the sun.<br> A kitchen garden that<br> smells of herbs in the day,<br> jasmine in the evening.<br> Through the gate<br> is a giant poplar.<br> Figs, apples, pears.<br> The soil, Marcus-<br> black.<br> - Black like my wife's hair.<br> Grapes on the south slopes,<br> olives on the north.<br> Wild ponies play near my house.<br> They tease my son.<br> - He wants to be one of them.<br> - Remember the last time you were home?<br> Two years, 264 days,<br> and this morning.<br> I envy you, Maximus.<br> It's a good home.<br> Worth fighting for.<br> There is one more duty...<br> that I ask of you<br> before you go home.<br> What would you<br> have me do, Caesar?<br> I want you to become<br> the protector of Rome after I die.<br> I will empower you<br> to one end alone.<br> To give power back<br> to the people of Rome...<br> and end the corruption<br> that has crippled it.<br> Will you accept this great honor<br> that I have offered you?<br> With all my heart, no.<br> Maximus,<br> that is why<br> it must be you.<br> But surely a prefect,<br> a senator,<br> somebody who knows the city,<br> who understands her politics.<br> But you have not been<br> corrupted by her politics.<br> - And Commodus?<br> - Commodus is not a moral man.<br> You have known that<br> since you were young.<br> Commodus cannot rule.<br> He must not rule.<br> You are the son<br> that I should have had.<br> Commodus will accept<br> my decision.<br> He knows that you command<br> the loyalty of the army.<br> I- I need<br> some time, sire.<br> Yes.<br> By sunset,<br> I hope you will have agreed.<br> Now embrace me as my son.<br> And bring an old man<br> another blanket.<br> - My father favors you now.<br> - My lady.<br> It was not always so.<br> Many things change.<br> Many things.<br> Not everything.<br> Maximus, stop.<br> Let me see your face.<br> Hmm. You seem upset.<br> I lost many men.<br> What did my father<br> want with you?<br> To wish me well<br> before I leave for home.<br> You're lying.<br> I could always tell when you were lying<br> because you were never any good at it.<br> - I never acquired your comfort with it.<br> - True.<br> But then you never had to.<br> Life is more simple<br> for a soldier.<br> Or do you<br> think me heartless?<br> I think you have<br> a talent for survival.<br> Maximus, stop.<br> Is it really so terrible<br> seeing me again?<br> No. I'm tired<br> from battle.<br> It hurts you to see<br> my father so fragile.<br> Commodus expects that my father will<br> announce his succession within days.<br> Will you serve my brother<br> as you served his father?<br> I will always serve Rome.<br> Do you know,<br> I still remember you<br> in my prayers.<br> Oh, yes. I pray.<br> I was sad to hear<br> of your husband's death. I mourned him.<br> - Thank you.<br> - And I hear you have a son.<br> Yes. Lucius.<br> He'll be nearly<br> eight years old.<br> My son is also<br> nearly eight.<br> I thank you<br> for your prayers.<br> Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.<br> Blessed mother, come tome<br> with the gods' desire for my future.<br> Blessed father, watch over<br> my wife and son with a ready sword.<br> Whisper to them I live<br> only to hold them again.<br> Ancestors, I honor you...<br> and will try to live with<br> the dignity you have taught me.<br> Cicero.<br> Sir.<br> You don't find it hard<br> to do your duty?<br> Sometimes I do<br> what I want to do.<br> The rest of the time<br> I do what I have to.<br> We may not be able<br> to go home after all.<br> Are you ready to do<br> your duty for Rome?<br> Yes, Father.<br> You will not be emperor.<br> Which wiser,<br> older man is to take my place?<br> My powers<br> will pass to Maximus...<br> to hold<br> in trust...<br> until the Senate<br> is ready to rule once more.<br> Rome is to be<br> a republic again.<br> - Maximus.<br> - Yes.<br> My decision<br> disappoints you?<br> You wrote to me once,<br> Listing the four chief virtues.<br> Wisdom, justice,<br> fortitude and temperance.<br> As I read the list,<br> I knew I had none of them.<br> But I have other virtues, Father.<br> Ambition.<br> That can be a virtue<br> when it drives us to excel.<br> Resourcefulness.<br> Courage.<br> Perhaps not on<br> the battlefield, but...<br> there are many forms of courage.<br> Devotion-<br> to my family...<br> and to you.<br> But none of my virtues<br> were on your list.<br> Even then it was as if<br> you didn't want me for your son.<br> Oh, Commodus.<br> You go too far.<br> I search the faces<br> of the gods...<br> for ways to please you,<br> to make you proud.<br> One kind word,<br> one full hug...<br> where you pressed me<br> to your chest and held me tight,<br> would have been like the sun<br> on my heart for a thousand years.<br> - What is it in me you hate so much?<br> - Shah, Commodus.<br> All I've ever wanted...<br> was to live up to you,<br> Caesar.<br> Father.<br> Commodus.<br> Your faults as a son...<br> is my failure as a father.<br> Come.<br> Father.<br> I would butcher<br> the whole world...<br> if you would<br> only love me!<br> Maximus, the Emperor needs you.<br> It's urgent.<br> Lament with me, brother.<br> Our great father is dead.<br> How did he die?<br> The surgeons say there was no pain.<br> His breath gave out<br> as he slept.<br> Father.<br> Your emperor asks<br> for your loyalty, Maximus.<br> Take my hand.<br> I only offer it once.<br> Quintus.<br> Hail, Caesar.<br> I must go to the senators.<br> I need their counsel.<br> - Wake Gaius and Falco.<br> - Gaius and Falco.<br> - Sword.<br> - Sword.<br> Maximus, please be careful.<br> That was not prudent.<br> Prudent?<br> The Emperor has been slain.<br> The Emperor died of natural causes.<br> - Why are you armed, Quintus?<br> - Guards!<br> Please don't fight,<br> Maximus.<br> I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.<br> Ride until dawn...<br> and then execute him.<br> Quintus, look at me.<br> Look at me!<br> Promise me that you will<br> look after my family.<br> Your family will meet you<br> in the afterlife.<br> - No!<br> Kneel.<br> Blessed Father,<br> watch over my wife and son.<br> - Whisper to them that I live<br> only to hold them again.<br> At least give me<br> a clean death.<br> A soldier's death.<br> The frost, sometimes it makes<br> the blade stick.<br> Praetorian!<br> Hyah! Hyah!<br> Remember the last time you were home?<br> Two years, 264 days, and this morning.<br> Blessed Father, watch over my<br> wife and son with a ready sword.<br> Whisper to them I live only<br> to hold them again.<br> For all else is dust and air,<br> and I live only to hold them again.<br> For all else is dust and air.<br> - Mama, isoldati!<br> - Papa! Papa!<br> Hyah! Hyah!<br> - Don't die.<br> - You'll meet them again.<br> - Not yet.<br> No! They will clean it.<br> Wait and see.<br> Don't die.<br> They'll feed you<br> to the lions.<br> They are worth more<br> than we are.<br> Better now?<br> Clean. You see?<br> Proximo!<br> My old friend.<br> Every day is a great day<br> when you are here.<br> Today...<br> is your most fortunate day.<br> Those giraffes<br> you sold me...<br> they won't mate.<br> They just walk around<br> eating and not mating.<br> You sold me...<br> queer giraffes.<br> - I want my money back.<br> - Not a chance.<br> - I do special price for you.<br> - On what?<br> Have you seen my new stock?<br> Come and see them.<br> Do any of them fight?<br> I've got a match coming up.<br> Some are good for fighting,<br> others for dying.<br> You need both, I think.<br> Get up!<br> - What's your trade?<br> - I was a hunter.<br> Oh, no. I bought him<br> from a salt mine in Carthage.<br> Sit down!<br> Mark of the legion.<br> - Deserter.<br> - Maybe so. But who cares?<br> - He's a Spaniard.<br> - I'll take six...<br> - for 1 ,000.<br> - 1,000?<br> The Numidian alone<br> is worth 2,000!<br> These slaves<br> are rotten.<br> It all adds to the flavor.<br> No. No, no, no. Wait-Wait.<br> Wait! Can negotiate.<br> I'll give you 2,000...<br> and four for the beasts.<br> That's 5,000<br> for an old friend.<br> Come on!

To order!<br> For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate<br> has prepared a series of protocols...<br> to begin addressing<br> the many problems in the city.<br> Beginning with basic sanitation<br> for the Greek quarter...<br> to combat the plague which is already<br> springing up there.<br> - So, if Caesar-<br> - Shah.<br> Don't you see, Gracchus?<br> That's the very problem,<br> isn't it?<br> My father spent<br> all his time at study...<br> of books and learning<br> and philosophy.<br> He spent his twilight hours<br> reading scrolls from the Senate.<br> And all the while,<br> the people have forgotten-<br> But the Senate<br> is the People, sire.<br> Chosen from among the people...<br> to speak for the people.<br> I doubt that many of the people<br> eat so well as you do, Gracchus.<br> Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.<br> I think I understand my own people.<br> Then, perhaps Caesar will<br> be so good as to teach us...<br> out of his own<br> extensive experience.<br> - I call it love.<br> - I am their father.<br> The people are my children.<br> And I shall hold them to my bosom<br> and embrace them tightly.<br> Have you ever embraced someone<br> dying of plague, sire?<br> No, but if you interrupt me again,<br> I assure you that you shall.<br> Senator, my brother<br> is very tired.<br> Leave your list with me.<br> Caesar shall do<br> all that Rome requires.<br> My lady, as always,<br> your lightest touch commands obedience.<br> Who are they<br> to lecture me?<br> Commodus, the Senate has its uses.<br> What uses?<br> All they do is talk.<br> It should be just...<br> you and me...<br> - and Rome.<br> - Don't even think it!<br> There's always<br> been a Senate.<br> Rome has changed.<br> It takes an emperor...<br> -to rule an empire.<br> -Of course, but leave the people their-<br> Illusions.<br> Traditions.<br> My father's war<br> against the barbarians-<br> He said it himself,<br> it achieved nothing.<br> - But the people loved him.<br> - The people always love victories.<br> Why? They didn't see the battles.<br> - What do they care about Germania?<br> - They care about the greatness of Rome.<br> The greatness of Rome.<br> Well, what is that?<br> It's an idea-<br> greatness.<br> - Greatness is a vision.<br> - Exactly. A vision.<br> Do you not see, Lucilla?<br> I will give the people a vision of Rome,<br> and they'll love me for it.<br> And they'll soon forget the tedious<br> sermonizing of a few dry, old men.<br> I will give the people<br> the greatest vision of their lives.<br> Vino, vino, vino!<br> White and red wine<br> for your drinking pleasure!<br> Vino, vino, vino! Red and white wine<br> for your drinking pleasure!<br> Games.<br> - He's cleverer than I thought.<br> - Oh, clever.<br> The whole of Rome would<br> be laughing at him...<br> if they weren't so afraid<br> of his Praetorians.<br> Fear and wonder-<br> a powerful combination.<br> You really think the people<br> are going to be seduced by that?<br> I think he knows what Rome is.<br> Rome is the mob.<br> Conjure magic for them,<br> and they'll be distracted.<br> Take away their freedom<br> and still they'll roar.<br> The beating heart<br> of Rome...<br> is not the marble<br> of the Senate.<br> It's the sand<br> of the Colosseum.<br> He'll bring them death,<br> and they will<br> love him for it.<br> Spaniard!
