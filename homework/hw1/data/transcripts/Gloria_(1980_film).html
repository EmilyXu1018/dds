Bye.<br> So are you divorced or not?<br> Sure I am.<br> But...<br> you get divorced from the woman,<br> not from the children. I...<br> I've been living alone<br> for a year now,<br> and I take care...<br> of the girls. They're...<br> They're very dependant on me, so...<br> they're not used<br> to being without daddy yet.<br> That's the way things are.<br> I used to have a very different life.<br> I was drowning.<br> I was bursting.<br> A year and one month ago,<br> I had surgery.<br> - What surgery?<br> - I had a gastric bypass.<br> I used to weigh 117 kilos.<br> - Right...<br> - I swear!<br> I swear it's true! I was huge.<br> No...<br> I decided to change,<br> I had the surgery,<br> and now I'm trying to operate<br> on myself, but on the inside.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Amazing, isn't it?<br> Sorry...<br> Okay.<br> We're going to stop...<br> There we go.<br> Vertigo?<br> Vertigo!<br> This is the hopper,<br> it's where the paintball<br> goes in, okay?<br> This is the trigger.<br> It has a safety. Here.<br> You take off the safety.<br> It's an automatic.<br> - More this way.<br> - This way?<br> Yes, this way.<br> No, that's a tree.<br> The black figure.<br> - You can see it, right?<br> - Yes, I see it.<br> I'm going a bit blind too,<br> but you hit the target!<br> You hit the bull's eye!<br> Good!<br> I love your park.<br> You know...<br> Men like to play war.<br> Yes.<br> Or the paths I haven't walked,<br> Or the paths I haven't walked,<br> or anything, or anyone...<br> I love you.<br> I miss you,<br> I dream of you, I wait for you,<br> I can't live without your kisses.<br> My life is no life<br> if you're not inside me.<br> I love you,<br> I miss you,<br> I dream of you, I wait for you,<br> I'm dying just to see you.<br> How could I not love you, my love,<br> my love, I don't want to lose you.<br> Virginia Acosta,<br> from Vina del Mar,<br> has requested Jeanette's<br> "Why Are You Leaving?"<br> When you had your surgery,<br> did they use a general anaesthetic<br> or an epidural?<br> Epidural...<br> I think it's general too.<br> The other kind is local, isn't it?<br> The one they used with me<br> is the kind that goes in the lV...<br> and gradually, they start<br> adding more anaesthetic.<br> Not like when I was a boy,<br> and I had surgery,<br> and they used chloroform.<br> I'm a little...<br> What's the word...?<br> - Claustrophobic.<br> - Oh, right.<br> - The nurse put the mask on my face...<br> - That's how they did it.<br> I put up a fight,<br> and she called other two nurses,<br> so three nurses<br> were pinning me down...<br> - How horrible.<br> - I started to drift off.<br> They called me<br> "chicken, chicken, chicken..."<br> "Anaesthesia" means that<br> all your senses are blocked.<br> - Right...<br> - Yes.<br> My daughter Ana<br> explained it to me.<br> But "Ana" doesn't mean that...<br> - No?<br> - No.<br> What does it mean?<br> "Ana" means...<br> "To sit gracefully."<br> - Is that right?<br> - Yes.<br> Do I look like<br> I'm "seated gracefully" now?<br> Look...<br> You look great.<br> Thanks.<br> And to have more love<br> for this country,<br> to recover our love for this country,<br> and not stay in our houses...<br> That's hard.<br> It's hard to love it.<br> But why, my dear?<br> Because<br> so many things have happened that...<br> what Chile used to be<br> now seems like a ghost,<br> as if that Chile were dead,<br> and what was built afterwards<br> is a kind of replica of something<br> that's being devised<br> in some other part of the world,<br> where the driving force<br> is just greed.<br> There aren't any leaders anymore.<br> - No.<br> - There aren't any leaders.<br> What are you going to do?<br> If it's about politicians<br> who are up there,<br> and they're the ones governing,<br> the ones that were chosen.<br> - We have to look to young people.<br> - Yes, I was thinking the other day<br> that they're not being<br> considered at all!<br> - The people are being...<br> - They've been robbed, they're outraged.<br> People consider that all of this...<br> has been an abuse.<br> And if you go to the doctor,<br> you have to pay a fortune,<br> if you have an accident,<br> you have to pay a fortune,<br> excuse me for being<br> self-referential but...<br> - No, it's the truth!<br> - It's the truth! You understand?<br> As a sociologist,<br> you must see it every day.<br> And you, in your store, you see<br> that people have had enough!<br> Although we don't use<br> Twitter or Facebook<br> the very fact that these things exist<br> represents a virtual multitude<br> that needed to get together.<br> And that same multitude,<br> that used to go out and<br> start revolutions,<br> is now leading a revolution<br> that's probably more spiritual.<br> All things transform, right?<br> One day,<br> you're the way you were before,<br> or the way I was before,<br> and the next, we're here...<br> That's not what I read<br> in the paper, what I read was<br> that all things transform,<br> and that astonished me.<br> Have you heard about<br> those black holes up there?<br> Yes, I've heard something.<br> Where matter is suddenly absorbed.<br> And the stars go...<br> "I'd like to be a nest<br> if you were a little bird."<br> I'd like to be a scarf<br> if you were a neck and were cold.<br> If you were music, I'd be an ear.<br> If you were water, I'd be a glass.<br> If you were light, I'd be an eye.<br> If you were a foot, I'd be a sock.<br> If you were the sea, I'd be a beach.<br> And if you were still the sea,<br> I'd be a fish,<br> and I'd swim in you.<br> And if you were the sea,<br> I'd be salt.<br> And if I were salt,<br> you'd be lettuce,<br> an avocado or at least a fried egg.<br> And if you were a fried egg,<br> I'd be a piece of bread.<br> And if I were a piece of bread,<br> you'd be butter or jam.<br> If you were jam,<br> I'd be the peach in the jam.<br> If I were a peach,<br> you'd be a tree.<br> And if you were a tree,<br> I'd be your sap...<br> and I'd course through<br> your arms like blood.<br> And if I were blood,<br> "I'd live in your heart."<br> Hello?<br> Hello, Dad?<br> Elena! Hello.<br> How are you?<br> Good. How about you?<br> That's nice.<br> Yes. I've already had lunch.<br> Well, she should take her pills.<br> What can I do about it?<br> I'm here at home.<br> I haven't been feeling well.<br> That's why I haven't been out.<br> What's that?<br> No, I'm not going out today.<br> I'm staying here. Okay.<br> Okay.<br> I don't think so.<br> We'll talk later, okay? Bye.<br> Did you like it?<br> I don't understand, really.<br> I mean...<br> Where are you?<br> Why are you here?<br> Because I'm with you.<br> Why can't you tell them<br> you're with me?<br> Why drag them into<br> a situation that they're<br> incapable of understanding?<br> They'd say, "You have a girlfriend!<br> You silly old man!"<br> How could you even think of<br> dating at your age?"<br> They'd make fun of me,<br> and why give them that chance?<br> I don't want to<br> involve them in our thing.<br> No way. No way.<br> I understand that we...<br> that I'm a part of your life, or not?<br> You're the most important part<br> of my life right now.<br> Then I want to feel that,<br> because I'm not,<br> if you're lying to your daughters.<br> - They're grown up, aren't they?<br> - They're not that grown up.<br> Physically they are,<br> but not inside.<br> When I had my surgery,<br> I felt lonelier than ever before.<br> Not one call...<br> Did they even call the hospital<br> and ask how I was doing?<br> Did they care about my health,<br> the operation, or anything?<br> Nothing! Ever.<br> I've always been the one<br> who worries about them<br> and they do nothing in return,<br> do you understand?<br> Nothing at all,<br> it's a terribly lonely feeling.<br> And I don't want you to have to<br> share that, to experience that.<br> And I thank you for understanding me.<br> Who's there?<br> Who is it?<br> What do you want?<br> - What is it?<br> - Open, you fucking door.<br> Gloria...<br> Morning, Mario.<br> I'd like to make a complaint.<br> He said he got confused.<br> He thought it was his apartment.<br> That's why the key<br> wouldn't fit in the lock.<br> This just can't happen, Mario.<br> He's in a bad way, Gloria.<br> - We all can get like that.<br> - He couldn't get in<br> because he couldn't get<br> the key in the lock,<br> so he decided to<br> climb up your balcony.<br> Happy birthday, son!<br> Thanks, Mom.<br> I wish you a good year,<br> a wonderful year!<br> Thanks.<br> - May everything turn out well, okay?<br> - Okay.<br> This will grow back, won't it?<br> - This is Rodolfo.<br> - Hello.
