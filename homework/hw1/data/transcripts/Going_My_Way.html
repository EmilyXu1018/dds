                        [Sweeping instrumental music]<br> But, Father Fitzgibbon,<br> why do you want a new furnace?<br> Because, Mr. Haines, last winter,<br> in the month of November alone...<br> four of me parishioners<br> took to the bed with pneumonia.<br> That's too bad.<br> It's only by a miracle<br> that I meself pulled through.<br> It'll only cost $632.50...<br> complete with an automatic damper.<br> But, Father, I didn't come here<br> to put in new furnaces.<br> I think you ought to give him<br> his furnace, Dad.<br> It would warm people's hearts,<br> and maybe his collections would be bigger.<br> No, Son. Improvements are out.<br> Now, Father...<br> That was good.<br> What he said, that was good.<br> Well, he's new to our business.<br> Now, Father...<br> - No furnace?<br> - No furnace.<br> Now, Father, here's my business.<br> You owe the Knickerbocker Savings<br> and Loan Company...<br> five payments on this mortgage.<br> If they're not taken care of...<br> I'm afraid the Knickerbocker Savings<br> and Loan Company...<br> will have to take the necessary action.<br> Why don't you make it<br> the subject of your sermon next Sunday?<br> Tell it to your people.<br> "The Lord loveth a cheerful giver."<br> Oh, I can imagine meself<br> saying that in Mass next Sunday.<br> What a sermon that would be, Mr. Haines.<br> "The text of me sermon this morning...<br> "is taken from the mortgage...<br> "according to Mr. Haines...<br> "from the 1st to the 23rd clause."<br> - Very dull, you know.<br> - But that's your business. Keep it bright.<br> But seriously, Father,<br> we've made a bad loan...<br> and we want our money back.<br> - Well, you'll get it somehow.<br> - That's all I wanted to know.<br> Good day, Father. Come on, Son.<br> Dad.<br> You can't foreclose.<br> Why, it just isn't being done.<br> I read up on it. There's never been<br> a Catholic church foreclosure...<br> - in the history of New York.<br> - There's always a first time, isn't there?<br> Don't you think you're being<br> a little harsh with him?<br> You've got to be.<br> Son, never loan money to a church.<br> As soon as you start to close in on them,<br> everybody thinks you're a heel.<br> - Well, aren't you?<br> - Yes.<br> Good morning. Could you tell me<br> where I'd find Saint Dominic's Church?<br> [Exclaims questioningly]<br> O'MALLEY: I'm looking<br> for St. Dominic's Church.<br> Why?<br> - I'm gonna work there.<br> - The new assistant?<br> And you can't even find the church.<br> Well, all I can say is, young man,<br> you're off to a mighty bad start.<br> What's your name?<br> Father O'Malley.<br> Charles Francis Patrick O'Malley.<br> O'MALLEY: What's yours?<br> WOMAN: Her name is Quimp!<br> Hattie Quimp!<br> You'll see a lot of her, you will.<br> At St. Dominic's,<br> she's a regular two-a-dayer.<br> Very religious, burns candles.<br> I could tell you plenty about them, too.<br> And if I did, they'd have<br> to leave the neighbourhood.<br> If you're looking for St. Dominic's, Father,<br> it's a block up and then to your left.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - How's things going?<br> - Terrible. They never hit one to me.<br> Watch right field for me a minute,<br> will you, Father?<br> - Sure.<br> - I got to run in the house.<br> O'MALLEY: Okay.<br> BOY 1: Hey, fellas,<br> the Father's gonna take my place.<br> BOY 2: Okay, Father.<br> O'MALLEY: I got it! Got it!<br> BOYS: Hurry up! Come on!<br> Thanks.<br> - What do you think you're doing?<br> - I'm the substitute right fielder.<br> You ought to be ashamed of yourself...<br> playing around with kids,<br> smashing people's windows.<br> MAN: A big grown-up man.<br> HATTIE: And a priest, besides.<br> - Hello.<br> - Still looking for St. Dominic's.<br> You just wait till I tell Father Fitzgibbon.<br> Look, you keep out of this, will you? Go on.<br> This is between him and me.<br> O'MALLEY: Honestly, I'm sorry<br> about the window.<br> Yeah, but being sorry don't fix it.<br> O'MALLEY: I intend to pay for it.<br> MAN: When?<br> Priests never have any money.<br> - That window...<br> - Now wait a minute, my good man...<br> I said I'd pay for it. I told you I'm sorry.<br> What else can I say after I say I'm sorry?<br> That ain't the idea.<br> It's the principle of the thing.<br> A priest shouldn't go around<br> breaking people's windows.<br> It sets a bad example for the children.<br> You got me stymied there. I'm contrite<br> and I'm penitent. I've told you I'm sorry.<br> - You told me that twice. But that don't...<br> - That doesn't fix the broken window, I know.<br> I think you're just playing hard<br> to get along with.<br> Maybe a little security might help?<br> These were given to me.<br> Why don't you keep them until I've made<br> good? Maybe they'll make you feel better.<br> They're mother of pearl, you see?<br> If that'll satisfy you, I'll run along.<br> Hey, you, here, I got no use for this.<br> First place, I don't believe in it.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I don't believe in anything.<br> - I can believe that.<br> - I'm an atheist. Besides, I'm superstitious.<br> All right, then, I'm sorry about the window.<br> I'll have it fixed.<br> Can I have the ball back?<br> You even throw like an atheist.<br> Mrs. Carmody,<br> did the young priest come yet?<br> He's here, but he insisted on<br> changing his clothes before seeing you.<br> That's nice. Tidy himself up a bit.<br> Hello, Father.<br> I'm your new curate, Father.<br> If you'll excuse my appearance.<br> No, it's not possible.<br> The Bishop may have a grudge against me.<br> He may think I've a mouthful of clover<br> and can't preach...<br> but even the Bishop<br> wouldn't do a thing like this to me.<br> I see what you mean.<br> Young man, may I ask...<br> is that the official garb<br> of the priests in St. Louis?<br> No, I...<br> Something happened to me on the way over.<br> I guess this just isn't my day, Father.<br> - Do you mind if I...<br> - No.<br> [Exclaims admonishingly]<br> Young man, as a matter of curiosity...<br> what made you become a priest?<br> Why, l...<br> [Telephone rings]<br> Hello?<br> Well, you don't say.<br> You don't say.<br> Oh, yes, I can well believe it, yeah.<br> Mrs. Quimp?<br> [Clears throat]<br> Yes, indeed, Mrs. Quimp.<br> I appreciate your good intentions.<br> Yes. Goodbye.<br> - I guess she told you about me?<br> - Yeah, the garrulous old biddy.<br> Young man, I'm afraid<br> you're off to a very bad start.<br> That's what she said. I'm sorry, Father, I...<br> Smashing people's windows. Such conduct.<br> Oh, yes, that reminds me.<br> I wanted to ask you something.<br> Listen now. Tell me, young man,<br> how did you happen to become a priest?<br> [Laughing] Well, l...<br> [Telephone rings]<br> Yeah.<br> Chuck? Chuck who?<br> - Father Chuck?<br> - That's me.<br> Here, I'll take it over here.<br> Hello? Timmy!<br> Well, how are you, Timmy? I just got in.<br> Well, what do you know?<br> That's Father O'Dowd, an old friend of mine.<br> We used to go to school together.<br> [Singing] Hail Alma Mater<br> Thy time-honoured halls<br> Shall echo with our praise till we die<br> And 'round our hearts<br> are the ivy-covered walls<br> Of East St. Louis<br> High<br> Good, Chuck. Can't you talk?<br> [Humming hesitantly]<br> Well, no.<br> All right, then, I'll do the talking.<br> How does your new pastor impress you?<br> You're a big help. It's a little early to say.<br> Time will tell, though.<br> [Exclaims negatively]<br> No, I think it would be better<br> if I told you when I saw you.<br> Yes, it would be much better.<br> All right, Timmy, make it soon, huh?<br> So long.<br> - He's a great little man.<br> - Yeah.<br> What were we talking about?<br> Yes, I was going to ask...<br> You were going to ask me<br> if I want to see the church.<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> - Yes.<br> [Church bell chiming]<br> - I like this. It's beautiful.<br> - Thank you.<br> - How long you been here, Father?<br> - Forty-five years.<br> - And the...<br> - Forty-six in October.<br> - The church?<br> - Same. I built it.<br> I can only hope someday I can say<br> I built as much.<br> - This is nice.<br> - Yeah, the birds like it.<br> They're good company. Listen.<br> [Lmitates bird chirping]<br> [O'Malley clears throat]<br> I've taken a great deal of pleasure<br> in me garden.<br> It's been hard work, but it's been worth it.<br> I think you'll find this a very pleasant place<br> in which to meditate.<br> - You do meditate, don't you?<br> - Oh, yes, sure.<br> FITZGIBBON: Now I'll show you the church.<br> FITZGIBBON: What we really need<br> is a loudspeaker system.<br> For a minute I thought I found<br> a four-leaf clover. Guess it just isn't my day.<br> Would you like to see the church?<br> O'MALLEY: Yes.<br> [Organ playing]<br> [Organ playing continues]<br> Mrs. Carmody, just a minute.<br> Just a minute.<br> FITZGIBBON: Where's Father O'Malley?<br> MRS. CARMODY: He left early this morning.<br> The young man doesn't sleep<br> as late as you do, you know.<br> - What's this?<br> - His luggage. It just arrived.<br> Golf, tennis. And where, may I ask,<br> is his fish pole?<br> It's here.<br> [Harrumphs]<br> - Good morning, Father.<br> - Been to market?<br> Mrs. Carmody could attend to that.<br> You should have been making parish calls.<br> I have. Mrs. McGonigle, the one<br> with the big house and rheumatism.<br> - She sent you a present.<br> - She did?<br> Very generous of her, I must say.<br> A fine Christian woman, Mrs. McGonigle.<br> Wonder what it is.<br> Something to eat, I dare say.<br> Jam. No, pickled pig's feet.<br> Possibly some brandied peaches.<br> If there's one thing I'm partial to,<br> it's a nice big jar of brandied peaches.<br> - A nice basket, too.<br> - Yes. She wants it back.<br> [Puppies whimpering]<br> They're too young. Much too young<br> to be separated from their mother.<br> That's what she said. So here's the mother.<br> - Isn't she cute?<br> - The joy of giving is indeed a pleasure.<br> Especially when you get rid<br> of something you don't want.<br> Mrs. McGonigle is famous for these tricks.<br> When her husband died,<br> she sent me his umbrella...<br> his long flannel underwear,<br> and his moustache cup.<br> [Singing] Hail Alma Mater<br> Thy time-honoured halls<br> Shall echo with our praise till we die<br> And 'round our hearts<br> are the ivy-covered walls<br> Of East St. Louis High<br> O'MALLEY: Timmy, how are you?<br> O'DOWD: Chuck, I'm glad to see you.<br> O'DOWD: How long<br> since we've seen each other?<br> O'MALLEY: Four years.<br> - Five, anyway.<br> - Has it been that long?<br> Pardon me. Father Fitzgibbon,<br> this is my old friend, Father O'Dowd.<br> How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?<br> We've been friends<br> since we were knee-high to a niblick.<br> He was our local Huckleberry Finn.<br> "Laugh and the world laughs with you,"<br> he'd say.<br> Cry, and you cry all by yourself.<br> How are you, Father?<br> I just dropped by to see if Father O'Malley<br> could play a little golf this afternoon.<br> - You did? Where's your parish?<br> - Right over here, St. Francis.<br> Well, now, about your golf.<br> Of course, I can't answer for you...<br> but at St. Dominic's we've very little time<br> for games of golf and such like.<br> If you were working for me, all I can say<br> is that you wouldn't have time for it, either.<br> It's lucky for me then that I'm at St. Francis.<br> It's my hope St. Francis can say the same.<br> - He's got you there, Timmy.<br> - Good, Father, very good.<br> Father, why don't you come with us?<br> It's a grand game.<br> Sure, we'll teach you.<br> A man is never too old to learn.<br> O'DOWD: Lot of fresh air on the golf course.<br> O'MALLEY: And profanity, too.<br> No, a golf course is nothing<br> but a poolroom moved outdoors.<br> You mind if I use that one sometime,<br> Father?<br> Young man, would you mind...<br> - How did he ever become a priest?<br> - Well, I don't...<br> - Father Fitzgibbon.<br> - Excuse me.<br> FITZGIBBON: Who is it?<br> MRS. CARMODY: Mrs. Quimp.<br> [Mumbling]<br> - Does he know?<br> - Does he know what?<br> - That you're in charge.<br> - How'd you know?<br> I didn't. I gathered as much<br> when I heard you were here.<br> Everybody knows<br> that St. Dominic's is in a bad way.<br> Father Fitzgibbon<br> is getting to be an old man.<br> - This needs a young fellow...<br> - Timmy, look.<br> - Don't mention it to anybody.<br> - No.<br> When I had my talk with the Bishop,<br> it was our understanding...<br> that Father Fitzgibbon<br> was to remain here as pastor...<br> and I was to try and straighten out<br> St. Dominic's without hurting his feelings.<br> I see. You're in charge, but you're not.<br> I don't think I'd like an assignment like that.<br> But the Bishop couldn't very well<br> put him out to pasture, could he?<br> "Pasture"?<br> What's this I hear about a pasture?<br> I was just saying to him, Father...<br> the next time I come past your church<br> I'm going to drop in and see you.<br> Good day, Father. So long, Chuck.<br> [O'Malley clears throat]<br> I was going to ask you something.<br> Oh, yes, the telephone.<br> Mrs. Quimp just telephoned.<br> Her landlord is throwing her out again.<br> She wants somebody to go and see her.<br> You better go.<br> I'll go right along, Father.<br> Would you mind the puppies?<br> Thank you.<br> I'll bet you're the new assistant...<br> the one who's going to get St. Dominic's<br> out of all its trouble.<br> And I'll bet you're all the trouble.<br> I'll wager you're the man with the mortgage.<br> - You've heard about the mortgage?<br> - All churches have mortgages.<br> It isn't respectable<br> for a church not to have one.<br> - My name's O'Malley.<br> - Mine's Haines.<br> Nice meeting you. We may have to<br> touch you for a little more a little later on.<br> We're gonna need<br> a new paint job here soon.<br> I must run along. You look like a man<br> it'll be a pleasure to do business with.<br> Yes.<br> HATTIE: Get out! You're not putting me out!<br> I'll pay you me rent when I get it!<br> HATTIE: Good morning, Father.<br> O'MALLEY: Good morning.<br> Hello, Father.<br> Mrs. Quimp and I were just discussing you.<br> - You were?<br> - As you know, I represent...<br> the Knickerbocker Savings<br> and Loan Company.<br> Inasmuch as Mrs. Quimp<br> declines to pay her rent...<br> the Knickerbocker Savings<br> and Loan Company...<br> - refuses to offer her any further hospitality.<br> - Is she very far in arrears?<br> TED: Mrs. Quimp has paid us nothing<br> for six months.<br> O'MALLEY: It's certainly very nice of you<br> to show her leniency.<br> Supposing the poor old woman<br> has no place to go?<br> The Knickerbocker Savings and Loan<br> Company is not a charitable institution...<br> like St. Dominic's.<br> With us, it's just a matter<br> of cold-blooded business.<br> With you it's different. You haven't got<br> anything and you don't want anything.<br> That's your business<br> and people respect you for it.<br> But I'm not in your business, see?<br> If I haven't got anything<br> and don't want anything, I'm a bum.<br> Surely there must be something<br> we can do about it.<br> I don't know what you'll do about it, but<br> I'm going to throw her right out on her ear.<br> Give her a break.<br> Give her a month to make good in.<br> - St. Dominic's will guarantee it.<br> - St. Dominic's?<br> I can see you haven't been around long.<br> Why, St. Dominic's is in worse shape<br> than Mrs. Quimp.<br> - My old man happens to own the mortgage...<br> - Your father holds the mortgage?<br> You're darn right he does.<br> Confidentially,<br> he'd like to find a way to foreclose.<br> He wants to tear down the church<br> and make a parking lot of it.<br> Can you imagine it?<br> He's a very disliked man.<br> - I'm sort of following in his footsteps.<br> - Junior?<br> [Turkeys gobbling]<br> HERMAN: It's turkeys.<br> TONY: Let's cut through the churchyard.<br> [Turkey gobbles]<br> FITZGIBBON: Good afternoon, boys.<br> BOYS: Hello, Father.<br> That's a fine fat bird you have there.<br> We was sort of bringing it over for you.<br> - It's sort of a present. Ain't it, Herman?<br> - Yeah.<br> That's very generous of you.<br> Such a fine bird and all.<br> Now, where may I ask did you get it?<br> - We got...<br> - We won it in a raffle over at the theatre.<br> - We were lucky.<br> - Isn't that great?<br> - But, surely, your mother...<br> - Except on Christmas, Ma don't like turkey.<br> - She don't?<br> - Honest.<br> That's most fortunate for me.<br> There's nothing I'm more partial to<br> than a nice tom turkey.<br> Roasted, all with dressing.<br> I appreciate your kindness, boys.<br> It ain't nothing, Father.<br> FITZGIBBON: On the contrary,<br> I appreciate the thought behind it.<br> Small luxuries, like small sacrifices,<br> are ofttimes the most godly.<br> Bless you both. Thank you.<br> Take it inside the kitchen<br> to the housekeeper.<br> HERMAN: Okay, Father, we'll see you later.<br> FITZGIBBON: So you guaranteed<br> Mrs. Quimp's rent?<br> O'MALLEY: Of course.<br> FITZGIBBON: St. Dominic's can't afford it.<br> I expected you to counsel Mrs. Quimp,<br> not to adopt her.<br> [Exclaims contentedly]<br> - Hot turkey.<br> - Hot? Of course it's hot.<br> That's what I say.<br> "Bless us, O Lord, for these Thy gifts<br> which we are about to receive. Amen."<br> Amen.<br> Say, Father, you know a youngster<br> around here named Tony Scaponi?<br> FITZGIBBON: What about him?<br> O'MALLEY: This afternoon...<br> Tony belongs to<br> a fine upstanding Catholic family.<br> Eleven children. Sure, I know Tony.<br> As fine a lad as there is in the parish.<br> Police don't think so.<br> - They don't?<br> - No.<br> If something isn't done<br> about Tony and his pals...<br> they're gonna wind up in a reform school.<br> - Who told you that?<br> - The police.<br> You've been listening<br> to Patrick McCarthy, no doubt.<br> Let me tell you that that man<br> hasn't been to Mass in the last 10 years.<br> That may be, but I think<br> McCarthy's right about those kids.<br> They're terrorising<br> the whole neighbourhood.<br> No use talking like that.<br> To hear the police talk, you'd think<br> that every lad in the parish was a criminal.<br> I'll have you know<br> that the very food there before us...<br> is brought to us by two of those very lads<br> the police are so maliciously slandering.<br> Is that so?<br> Tony Scaponi was one of them.<br> I gave them both my blessing.<br> O'MALLEY: And they gave you the bird.<br> FITZGIBBON: Yeah.<br> [O'Malley laughs heartily]<br> [Doorbell buzzing]<br> I'll get it.<br> O'MALLEY: Hello, McCarthy.<br> MCCARTHY: Good evening, Father.<br> Well, I brung them.<br> Tony Scaponi, Herman Langerhanke.<br> O'MALLEY: Hi, fellows.<br> I don't think you have to wait, McCarthy.<br> Okay, Father.<br> O'MALLEY: Say, I understand that<br> you fellows like baseball pretty well.<br> TONY: Yeah.<br> O'MALLEY: I was thinking, Saturday...<br> the Yanks are playing the St. Louis Browns,<br> a doubleheader.<br> Would you like to go out<br> and see the games with me?<br> St. Louis is my old hometown, you know.<br> I'll get all the passes I want.<br> - What do you say?<br> - Well, I guess so.<br> Yeah, sure, I guess<br> the fellas would like that.<br> It's a date then.<br> I'll meet you here Saturday at noon?<br> That'd be good.<br> You run along and have your dinner.<br> I'll go finish my turkey.<br> Let me see now, where was I?<br> Oh, yeah, I know.<br> I was going to ask you something.<br> - What made me become a priest?<br> - No.<br> About young Tony.<br> What was it the police accused him of?<br> Stealing.<br> - Stealing what?<br> - Turkeys.<br> Seems the boys hijacked a poultry truck<br> down the street here.<br> There was quite a bit of excitement.<br> The driver reported them to the police.<br> Did the poor man get his turkeys back?<br> All but one, Father.<br> [O'Malley clears throat]<br> Thank you.<br> [Playing sombre music]<br> O'MALLEY: McCarthy, how are you?<br> Good morning, Father.<br> You open for business?<br> Always open for business, McCarthy.<br> Come on in.<br> MCCARTHY: Come on.<br> Come right in, Pat.<br> - I got a problem, Father.<br> - Yeah?<br> Seems like it's more yours than mine.<br> It's her. Well, Father, it's this way.<br> Last night I'm walking me beat, see?<br> Who do you think I runs into?<br> - Her?<br> - Mrs. Quimp.<br> [Lmitating Hattie] "Officer McCarthy,"<br> she says.<br> - You know how the old stool pigeon talks.<br> - Yes, I do.<br> "If you'll go around the corner,<br> you'll find a girl.<br> "I've been watching her<br> and she ain't up to no good."<br> Well, Father, I goes around the corner<br> and there, like the Quimp says, I finds her.<br> MCCARTHY: Do you follow me, Father?<br> O'MALLEY: Yes.<br> Well, I looks at her and sizes her up.<br> One of those things, I think.<br> I'm just about to say to her:<br> "Look, sister, not on my beat."<br> When she turns,<br> and right away I sees I'm out of line.<br> - You follow me, Father?<br> - Yeah.<br> To get down to it, Father,<br> I find she's broke and run away from home.<br> Doesn't know a soul in town.<br> So, instead of booking her,<br> I takes her home.<br> It's all right with the missus for one night,<br> but if she stays any longer...<br> I guess Mrs. McCarthy,<br> good woman that she is...<br> is no different from any other woman.<br> - You follow me, Father?<br> - I follow you.<br> So, anyway, she tells us<br> that she's run away from home...<br> on account of<br> her folks don't understand her.<br> We tried arguing with her, Father,<br> but she's a tough one.<br> She thinks "Honour thy father<br> and thy mother" is a belly laugh.<br> Well, Father, guess I'll let you<br> pick it up from here.<br> MCCARTHY: Says her name's Carol James.<br> O'MALLEY: All right, McCarthy.<br> MCCARTHY: So long.<br> O'MALLEY: Goodbye.<br> MCCARTHY: All right. You can go in now.<br> Come right in.<br> Won't you sit down over here?<br> Carol, suppose you give us<br> your version of it?<br> I guess it's just about like he said.<br> - You don't get along with your parents?<br> - No.<br> - So you're going to leave home?<br> - I've left.<br> How are you fixed for funds?<br> I haven't any.<br> That's how I met Officer McCarthy.<br> But I'll get by.<br> - Why don't you go back home?<br> - I tell you, at home my life is intolerable.<br> O'MALLEY: Parents?<br> CAROL: We don't agree on anything.<br> Don't like the way I do my hair,<br> my eyebrows, too much lipstick.<br> Too something or other, too long, too short.<br> Do you think it's too short?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> They even object to my boyfriends.<br> If they do let me go out, they say,<br> "Where are you going? Come home early.<br> - "Come right home after the show."<br> - "No drive-in."<br> No matter how early I get in, it's too late.<br> And if I say we ran out of gas,<br> they say I'm lying.<br> - Are you?<br> - Sometimes.<br> Did you ever think of maybe<br> having the boyfriends over to the house?<br> [Sighing] Now you talk like they do.<br> I can't have them over to the house<br> because Grandma sleeps in the living room.<br> She does?<br> By 9:00 we have to be off the couch.<br> She needs it for a bed. Can you imagine?<br> Of course, you know,<br> there might be two sides to it.<br> - Maybe you're being a little unreasonable.<br> - I'm 18.<br> Eighteen? As old as that?<br> [Whistles]<br> When I was 18,<br> I thought my father was pretty dumb.<br> After a while, when I got to be 21...<br> I was amazed to find out<br> how much he'd learned in three years.<br> Now that you're in New York,<br> what do you propose to do?<br> - I'm going to get a job. I'm a singer.<br> - A singer? You any good?<br> - Of course I'm good.<br> - What makes you think so?<br> Well, I...<br> I'm just good, that's all.<br> Would you sing something for me?<br> Maybe I can help you.<br> O'MALLEY: Supposed to be<br> a pretty good judge.<br> You wouldn't know the kind of songs<br> I know.<br> How do you know?<br> [Exclaims in surprise]<br> - Do you happen to know Day After Forever?<br> - What key?<br> Do you mind dropping it just a little?<br> [Singing] All day tomorrow<br> I'll be whispering your name<br> And the day after forever<br> I know I'll do the same<br> Maytime or winter<br> I won't let you out of sight<br> And the day after forever<br> We'll talk about tonight<br> Your laughter is a melody<br> That I'll remember long<br> It plays upon my heartstrings<br> It's my favourite song<br> All through a lifetime<br> I'll be loving you and then<br> On the day after forever<br> I'll just begin again<br> What do you think?<br> You got a pretty nice voice,<br> but instead of so much of this...<br> you ought to think about putting<br> a little feeling into the words.<br> For instance, Father?<br> [Playing romantic music]<br> [Singing] All day tomorrow<br> I'll be whispering your name<br> And the day after forever<br> I know I'll do the same<br> Maytime or winter<br> I won't let you out of sight<br> And the day<br> After forever<br> We'll talk about tonight<br> I see what you mean, Father.<br> Supposing you try it then?<br> Just speak the words.<br> Your laughter is a melody...<br> - that I'll remember long.<br> - That's it.<br> - It plays upon my heartstrings.<br> - Now sing it.<br> [Singing] It's my favourite song<br> All through a lifetime<br> I'll be loving you<br> BOTH: and then<br> On the day after forever<br> CAROL: I'll just begin<br> again<br> What's that "again"?<br> - I was imitating you, Father.<br> - Did I do that?<br> CAROL: Definitely.<br> O'MALLEY: Maybe, but I didn't do that...<br> [lmitating Carol] And the day after forever<br> You're my favourite song<br> There's no thought behind that at all.<br> We'll talk about<br> What has that got to do with the song?<br> Hello, Father.<br> This young lady came to us for some help.<br> [Fitzgibbon exclaims inquisitively]<br> FITZGIBBON: So it's work you're wanting.<br> CAROL: Yes, Father.<br> - I think maybe I could place you.<br> - You can?<br> What would you think<br> of a little general housework?<br> Mrs. Scaponi, with all those children,<br> 11, no, 1 2, in October.<br> FITZGIBBON: I think<br> maybe she could use you.<br> No. I'm not looking for that kind of work.<br> I don't think you understand, Father.<br> She's a singer.<br> [Humming]<br> Aren't you?<br> FITZGIBBON: Well, now...<br> FITZGIBBON: And where, may I ask,<br> are you expecting to find employment?<br> FITZGIBBON: In some nice cool,<br> airy nightclub, I suppose.<br> FITZGIBBON: Any prospects?<br> CAROL: No. Not exactly.<br> And you're willing to starve<br> rather than push a broom?<br> - You have a home, I presume?<br> - No, she just left it, Father.<br> FITZGIBBON: Go right back to your parents.<br> A fine little girl like you<br> singing someplace like that...<br> Blue Goose or something.<br> But you've got to start someplace, Father.<br> Nonsense. Being a good wife and mother<br> is a good enough start for you.<br> Like your own mother.<br> [Sighing]<br> - Goodbye, Father.<br> - Goodbye.<br> FITZGIBBON: Young lady, you go home and<br> stay home till the right man comes around.<br> The right man will never come<br> near our house.<br> But don't worry. I'll get by.<br> Carol!<br> Wait just a minute. Father.<br> - Do you think you could let me have 10?<br> - Of what?<br> $10. She's all alone. She hasn't a thing.<br> Open up our hearts. $10.<br> [Whispering] Just a minute.<br> - How about $5?<br> - No, $10.<br> Carol, I didn't like the way you said,<br> "I'll get by."<br> O'MALLEY: Here's something<br> to tide you over.<br> But, Father...<br> It's all right. It's not charity. It's a loan.<br> Thanks. I can use it.<br> I appreciate it.<br> I guess there's a lot of things<br> I should have said to you...<br> advice and one thing or another.<br> But you wouldn't have paid any attention.<br> After all, you are 18, aren't you?<br> CAROL: Don't worry. I'll be all right.<br> O'MALLEY: Of course you will, Carol.<br> - I'll get by.<br> - Don't say that.<br> O'MALLEY: Let us hear from you.<br> CAROL: All right, Father.<br> CAROL: Bye.<br> O'MALLEY: Bye, Carol.<br> [Church bell chiming]<br> [Boys chattering]<br> Hey, fellas.<br> What are we doing<br> hanging around here for?<br> [All exclaiming] Yeah!<br> - 'Cause I promised O'Malley, that's what for.<br> - Why?<br> - 'Cause I said so, see?<br> - Hey, fellas, look.<br> HERMAN: Lace panty-coats.<br> ALL: Yeah, lace panty-coats.<br> First thing you know,<br> he'll be charming us into these things.<br> BOY 1: Yeah, making altar boys out of us.<br> Hold it. First guy up, I kick his teeth in, see?<br> Look, you, O'Malley's a right guy, see?<br> Pick him up.<br> Look, you, O'Malley's a right guy, see?<br> He didn't rat on us about the turkeys,<br> did he?<br> ALL: No.<br> TONY: Took us to a baseball game?<br> ALL: Yeah.<br> TONY: Bought us hot dogs, didn't he?<br> ALL: Yeah.<br> TONY: He's gonna take us to a picture show,<br> ain't he?<br> How do we know?<br> - Hello, Father. Say hello to the Father.<br> - Hello, Father.<br> Hi, fellas.<br> TONY: Where'd you get the outfit?<br> O'MALLEY: It's the St. Louis Browns.<br> I used to work out with them.<br> They thought I brought them luck.<br> - When I left, they gave it to me.<br> - That's the outfit to wear in a cellar.<br> Oh, you, knocking my team.<br> I guess you fellas wonder<br> why I asked you down here.<br> Father, I want to talk to you a minute.<br> - Wanna see me?<br> - Just a minute.<br> Pardon me, boys.<br> Tony, what's on your mind?<br> Well, Father, so you won't have no beef<br> coming, I'm laying it on the line, okay?<br> Okay. They're here. Like I promised.<br> Only, you should have heard them squawk.<br> Worse than that turkey.<br> - They did?<br> - Yeah, they figured being a priest...<br> you were gonna slip them the old routine.<br> Personally, I'm for giving you a break.<br> What I say goes.<br> - Swell of you, Tony.<br> - It ain't nothing, Father.<br> Only, the way it is now,<br> I'm on the hook for you, see?<br> - I'm responsible for you. Get me?<br> - I won't let you down.<br> Maybe you won't,<br> but you step out of line once...<br> me and the gang will drop you<br> like you were a hot potato.<br> - Okay. Can I talk to them now?<br> - Sure, go ahead.<br> Boys, I'm not gonna do much talking.<br> Like Tony says,<br> I'm gonna lay it right on the line.<br> I asked you down here to do me a favour.<br> St. Dominic's needs a choir,<br> and I want to start one.<br> [Murmuring in dissent]<br> I know what you're thinking,<br> but it's not gonna be that way at all.<br> It's gonna be fun. Believe me,<br> I like fun as much as anybody.<br> If it doesn't turn out that way...<br> if you think I'm trying<br> to slip something over on you...<br> like Tony says, you can drop me<br> "like a hot potato."<br> What do you say?<br> You gonna give me a break?<br> Father, that depends. What is it?<br> How many of you here know<br> Three Blind Mice?<br> BOY 2: I know it.<br> O'MALLEY: One, two. Any more?<br> - Come on, you all know it.<br> - Everybody knows it?<br> - Sure.<br> - Fine.<br> O'MALLEY: What's the matter with him?<br> TONY: Herman? He's pouting.<br> Hey, Herman!<br> - He's got a good bass voice. You want him?<br> - Certainly, Tony.<br> You've got him, Father.<br> Now, let's see,<br> we got to divide this up someway.<br> Hey, Herman, wait a minute.<br> - The Father wants to see you.<br> - I don't wanna see the Father...<br> TONY: Keep quiet, will you, please?<br> Don't hit me on the head.<br> You make me dopey!<br> You are dopey. Now keep quiet. Come here.<br> - Look, he wants a bass singer.<br> - I ain't a bass singer!<br> - You are a bass singer.<br> - Why am I a bass singer?<br> - That burns me up!<br> - My head!<br> - [Whispering] He wants a bass singer.<br> - I don't know how to sing...<br> Will you go down? Now, keep quiet, okay?<br> TONY: Let's go.<br> HERMAN: Okay.<br> [Boys singing] Three blind mice<br> See how they run!<br> They all ran after the farmer's wife<br> Who cut off their tails<br> With a carving knife<br> Did you ever see such a sight in your life<br> As three blind mice<br> Three blind mice<br> See how they run!<br> They all ran after the farmer's wife<br> Who cut off their tails<br> With a carving knife<br> Did you ever see such a sight in your life<br> As three blind mice<br> MRS. CARMODY: It's no business of mine,<br> but sometimes...<br> the things you do in haste<br> are the things we most regret.<br> Think it over a while. Then if you really feel<br> you must see the Bishop...<br> That I do.<br> But the boys are better off here<br> than running the streets.<br> - I'm sure that was Father O'Malley's idea.<br> - I'm a tolerant man, Mrs. Carmody.<br> But there are some things<br> that get under my skin...<br> and Three Blind Mice is one of them.<br> But he's young, Father.<br> I'll admit, maybe a wee bit impulsive.<br> But I know he means well.<br> After all, it was the Bishop himself<br> did put him here.<br> And the Bishop himself<br> will put him someplace else.<br> I'm going to ask<br> to have Father O'Malley transferred.<br> FITZGIBBON: Don't worry.<br> It's not a bad report I'll be making.<br> I'll just tell the Bishop<br> that this young man and I differ.<br> We don't see eye to eye.<br> I'd be happier<br> if he were sent some other place.<br> It's a long, hard road you've come, Father.<br> Forty-five years, and most of the time<br> carrying other people's burdens.<br> The time has come<br> when you should rest on your oars.<br> Take things a mite easier. Enjoy your life.<br> Let somebody else carry the load for you.<br> Sure, and Father O'Malley's got<br> a strong pair of shoulders.<br> [Boys singing] Three blind mice<br> See how they run!<br> They all ran after the farmer's wife<br> See what I mean?<br> No, I've got to see the Bishop.<br> O'MALLEY: We got our sections.<br> I'll give each section a note.<br> O'MALLEY: Then we'll put them together<br> and have a chord.<br> Take this section first. Here's your note.<br> [Vocalising]<br> Got that? Let me hear it now.<br> [One boy harmonizing]<br> I thought we had singers here.<br> Let's hear everybody in this section.<br> Big, now, let me hear it.<br> [Boys vocalising]<br> O'MALLEY: That's good.<br> Second section, here's your note.<br> [Vocalising]<br> You got that?

You?<br> O'MALLEY: What's your name?<br> ELMER: Elmer.<br> Elmer, your voice is changing, isn't it?<br> ELMER: I guess so, Father.<br> Have to drop you down a bracket.<br> Get here in the third section.<br> Elmer is a switch hitter, it seems.<br> Let me hear that second section again.<br> [Boys vocalising]<br> That's great.<br> Now the third section. Here's your note.<br> Got that?<br> [Boys vocalising]<br> Elmer, you sing like<br> you're made for this section.<br> Now we're gonna drop way down<br> in the basement. Watch. It's tricky.<br> Everybody take a toehold.<br> [Vocalising]<br> That's your note. Let me hear it.<br> [Boys vocalising]<br> O'MALLEY: There's a pink one somewhere.<br> TONY: That wasn't me.<br> What did you sing?<br> [Tony's voice cracks]<br> [All laughing]<br> [O'Malley clears throat]<br> Sit down, Tony. Okay.<br> Everybody together now.<br> You got your notes?<br> We hit them all together<br> and we got a nice chord. Ready?<br> Everybody take a deep breath now.<br> Let's hear it.<br> [All vocalising in harmony]<br> O'MALLEY: You got chord number one,<br> chord number two, chord number three.<br> O'MALLEY: Put those chords together<br> and we can sing a song.<br> I'll hold up the fingers, they'll be<br> your signals. Watch the signals.<br> Make out I'm the catcher.<br> I'm giving you the signals. One, two, three.<br> Ready? Here's your note now.<br> [O'Malley singing note]<br> [O'Malley Singing] Silent night<br> [Boys humming]<br> Holy night<br> All is calm<br> All is bright<br> Round yon Virgin Mother and Child<br> Holy Infant so tender and mild<br> Sleep in heavenly peace<br> Sleep in heavenly peace<br> That's fine, boys. Thanks very much.<br> Want to call it a day? There's still<br> enough light outside for some baseball.<br> BOY 3: Let's sing some more.<br> BOY 4: Yeah, let's go ahead.<br> BOY 5: Yeah, come on!<br> BOY 6: Let's sing some more.<br> [All agreeing]<br> [Solemn instrumental music]<br> - You saw the Bishop, Father?<br> - Yeah.<br> Would you ask Father O'Malley<br> if he'd mind stepping into me study?<br> [Solemn instrumental music continues]<br> O'MALLEY: You wanted to see me, Father?<br> FITZGIBBON: Yes, so I did.<br> Sit down.<br> Father O'Malley, I've been to see the Bishop.<br> Oh, you have?<br> And I want to be frank with you.<br> I must admit that my purpose<br> in going to see the Bishop...<br> was to have you transferred.<br> I'm sorry you don't like me, Father.<br> I don't dislike anyone.<br> It's just that I disagree with you.<br> What did the Bishop say?<br> After a little talk, he congratulated me...<br> on me 45 years at St. Dominic's.<br> He has a remarkable memory.<br> He said it was a monument...<br> to the fact that I had built it.<br> Coming from the Bishop,<br> that's certainly a fine compliment.<br> Then I told him<br> I had come to talk about you.<br> That seemed to disturb him.<br> Then he started telling me<br> about what a fine young man you are.<br> Capable, progressive,<br> how much confidence he had in you.<br> He even told me that...<br> he had a nice talk with you<br> before you reported to me.<br> Of course, he didn't tell me<br> what you two talked about.<br> He didn't have to.<br> I could see it in the good man's eyes.<br> When you get to my age,<br> you can do that, you know. Oh, yes.<br> Then, after a little more telling me<br> how progressive you were...<br> he asked me why I'd come.<br> And knowing what was on his mind<br> and to save him the embarrassment...<br> of having to tell me...<br> The Bishop.<br> The Bishop wouldn't hurt anyone.<br> I put him at his ease.<br> "Bishop," I said...<br> "the very thing that's on your mind<br> is on mine.<br> "It's the very thing<br> I've come to see you about.<br> "I want you to put young Father O'Malley...<br> "in charge of St. Dominic's."<br> The Bishop seemed much relieved.<br> He congratulated me on my ability to see...<br> so clearly at my age...<br> on my ability to face the inevitable.<br> Then what happened?<br> [Sniffs]<br> That was all.<br> O'MALLEY: Father, why can't we go along<br> just as we have been?<br> No. You're in charge now.<br> Sit down.<br> No, Father.<br> Sit down. I'll familiarise you with...<br> O'MALLEY: There's no hurry about it.<br> We can do that anytime, Father.<br> Is there anything you'd like me to do.<br> I mean, now?<br> O'MALLEY: Nothing.<br> Well, then...<br> if you don't mind,<br> I'll lie down a while before dinner.<br> O'MALLEY: All right, Father.<br> When you and the Bishop<br> had your little talk...<br> it was more or less<br> along those lines, wasn't it?<br> O'MALLEY: Yes.<br> [Solemn instrumental music continues]<br> I think you better start without him.<br> Looks like he's not coming down for dinner.<br> He said he wanted to take a little nap.<br> He didn't look well, did he,<br> when he came in this evening?<br> Go see if he's awake.<br> If he's coming down, I'll wait for him.<br> MRS. CARMODY: Father O'Malley!<br> Father O'Malley!<br> Father! He's gone.<br> He's packed his things, everything.<br> He's gone.<br> - Where would he go?<br> - I can't imagine.<br> Okay, sure, but keep at it, will you?<br> No, you can't miss him. A little guy. Old.<br> Got a grip and an umbrella.<br> Okay.<br> Nothing yet, Father. They're gonna check<br> the subways, the hospitals.<br> Look, Father, take it easy, will you?<br> You better go home.<br> No use the two of us getting drowned.<br> Call me the minute you hear anything.<br> - I don't care what time it is.<br> - I will.<br> [Clock ticking]<br> MRS. CARMODY: Shall I make some coffee?<br> [Exclaims questioningly]<br> No, thank you.<br> Come on. Now what's the matter?<br> If you don't mind it,<br> I'd rather go in by myself.<br> If you don't mind, I found you<br> and I'll deliver you personally.<br> That's not necessary.<br> There's no reward, you know.<br> It's going to be a little difficult...<br> and I'd rather explain to Father O'Malley<br> in me own way.<br> And I can do that better<br> when you're not around.<br> Okay. But if you want my advice...<br> you just tell him you've been a bad boy,<br> you ran away from home and you're sorry.<br> And if you want my advice,<br> you'll go to church on Sunday...<br> and say you haven't been to Mass<br> in 10 years and that you're sorry.<br> [Chuckles]<br> [Clock ticking]<br> [Door opening]<br> Hello.<br> If you don't mind, I've come back,<br> but only temporarily.<br> Until me plans are more formulated...<br> maybe you wouldn't mind letting me stay.<br> I'll be no bother to you.<br> Here, Father.

I'll...<br> - Come on now, Father, just a wee snack.<br> I've been keeping it for you on the stove.<br> Nice juicy cut of roast beef,<br> Yorkshire pudding...<br> and there were some creamed onions, too.<br> And some asparagus<br> with buttered breadcrumbs.<br> And golden brown potatoes<br> and a nice cup of coffee.<br> Well, if you insist...<br> just a small portion of everything.<br> I hope it wasn't too much trouble for you,<br> Mrs. Carmody.<br> - No trouble at all, Father.<br> - I feel I ought to help with the dishes.<br> Don't worry about the dishes.<br> It isn't much washing they'll be needing.<br> You're still a little cold, Father.<br> You were drenched to the skin.<br> You ought to take a little something<br> to warm you up.<br> Do you have a wee drop<br> of the "crature" about?<br> Matter of fact, I might have a little one<br> with you. I was out myself tonight.<br> I went out for a paper.<br> Well, in that case...<br> - I'll ask Mrs. Carmody where she keeps it.<br> - No. Look yonder in the bookcase.<br> No, the other side.

She'd like you, too.<br> She always had a song in her heart.<br> I can almost hear her now.<br> [Music box playing]<br> Me boy, do you know Too Ra Loo Ra Loo?<br> [Singing] Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral<br> Too-ra-loo-ra-li<br> Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral<br> Hush now, don't you cry<br> Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral<br> Too-ra-loo-ra-li<br> Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral<br> That's an Irish lullaby<br> Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral<br> [Humming tune]<br> FITZGIBBON: Good night.<br> [Laughs softly]<br> Take it easy, boys.<br> Here, Tony, here's the fare.<br> O'MALLEY: Everybody right home<br> and to bed. Get a lot of rest.<br> I'm responsible for you. Don't forget<br> we got a rehearsal in the morning.<br> - Aren't you coming with us?<br> - No, I think I'll walk home.<br> I want to think about my sermon for Sunday.<br> - It'll be extra special for your parents.<br> - Oh, good.<br> On how to bring up children.<br> Father! Good luck to you!<br> [Children's voices harmonizing]<br> Chuck.<br> - Jenny!<br> - Chuck, it's good to see you.<br> It's good to see you, too.<br> - Where were you going, Jenny?<br> - To work, and I'm late. Come along.<br> [Musical instruments being tuned]<br> MAN: Gangway.<br> What are you doing here?<br> This is the Metropolitan.<br> - This is where I work.<br> - Wait a minute. Isn't that Carmen?<br> [Laughs heartily]<br> What do you play,<br> one of the spectators at the bullfight?<br> Believe it or not, I'm Carmen.<br> O'MALLEY: Jenny Tuffle, Carmen?<br> I've changed that. It's Genevieve Linden.<br> I was singing Carmen in Rio<br> and they heard me and said:<br> "Would you sing it here?"<br> Here. Can you imagine?<br> - Jenny Tuffle at the Metropolitan.<br> - Imagine that.<br> Well, Chuck, make yourself comfortable.<br> I have to be getting on with it.<br> It's good to see you, Chuck.<br> [Soft instrumental music]<br> Come on, Effie, I'm terribly late.<br> I don't know why I'm even talking to you.<br> O'MALLEY: No?<br> JENNY: Why didn't you write?<br> - I did write.<br> - I know you did, but why did you stop?<br> O'MALLEY: Didn't I tell you?<br> JENNY: No, you didn't, but you're going to.<br> Jenny? Please, I want to ask you<br> just a small favour.<br> Hello, Tommy. What is it?<br> Tonight, would you be so good<br> as to glance occasionally at my baton?<br> Tonight, let's not race.<br> Let's try just for once to finish together?<br> [Jenny laughs]<br> JENNY: All right, Tommy,<br> I promise. And, Tommy, do me a favour.<br> Meet Chuck O'Malley.<br> He's a very old friend of mine.<br> Chuck, Signor Tommaso Bozanni.<br> Father. "Chuck"?<br> She always calls me that.<br> You haven't told me yet, Chuck.<br> Why did you stop writing?<br> I did tell you in my last letter.<br> Which letter was that?<br> I guess that must have been<br> the letter you didn't get.<br> You wrote to me in Rome, in Florence...<br> Naples, Vienna, Budapest.<br> Then I went to Switzerland, and I found<br> your letter waiting for me in Lucerne.<br> You should have been there, Chuck.<br> It was a week before Christmas<br> and there was a quaint little post office.<br> I walked up to it in the snow.<br> The moon was so bright<br> that I read your letter on the way home.<br> And I answered it that night.<br> But that letter in Lucerne<br> was the last one I got.<br> From there I went to South America.<br> But there were no more letters.<br> What happened, Chuck?<br> [Soft instrumental music continues]<br> Chuck, what...<br> Father Chuck.<br> It'll take me a little while to get used to that.<br> Where's your parish, Father?<br> I'm over here at St. Dominic's,<br> about 10 blocks from here.<br> O'MALLEY: You remember Timmy?<br> Tim O'Dowd? Yes, of course, I do.<br> He's at St. Francis now. He's a priest, too.<br> Dear old Timmy. Can you imagine that?<br> Well, I'll have to be running along.<br> Please don't go.<br> Tommy, he can stand in the wings, can't he?<br> TOMMY: It would be a privilege.<br> JENNY: Please.<br> You know, Tommy...<br> Father O'Malley was the first one<br> to tell me I could sing.<br> Maybe one day I'll tell her the same thing.<br> If she listens to you,<br> maybe you could persuade her...<br> to listen just once to me.<br> Watch the baton.<br> Good luck, Miss Tuffle.<br> [Singing opera song]<br> [Chorus singing]<br> [Audience applauding]<br> - You wanted to see me, Father?<br> - Yeah.<br> Mrs. Quimp here, good woman that she is...<br> has come here<br> with a bit of disturbing information.<br> I think it should more properly<br> be brought to your attention.<br> Nice work, Mrs. Quimp. What is it?<br> Suppose you tell Father O'Malley<br> in your own words.<br> You'd better tell him, Father.<br> Your little songbird<br> who was without funds...<br> but not a bit interested<br> in general housework...<br> is feathering her nest in her own manner.<br> And if Mrs. Quimp's observations<br> are correct, a very fine manner it is.<br> It seems, Father O'Malley,<br> that the young lady in question...<br> has an apartment directly across the street.<br> Opposite Mrs. Quimp's bedroom.<br> According to Mrs. Quimp, young Ted Haines<br> comes early and stays so late that...<br> Mrs. Quimp is losing a lot of sleep.<br> It's queer, isn't it, Father?<br> Young Haines was ready to throw me out<br> without so much as a "How do you do?"<br> But when it comes to this young lady...<br> and mark you, there are other words<br> I could call her...<br> he acts quite different.<br> Don't you think it's strange?<br> That's a question.<br> People do funny things, you know.<br> Fine goings-on, Father O'Malley.<br> It's as plain as the nose on your face.<br> The nose on whose face, Father?<br> It doesn't matter whose face it's on.<br> You and I have got to face it.<br> Excuse us.<br> This is very serious business,<br> Father O'Malley.<br> As you're more familiar with the case,<br> I think you should handle it.<br> I'll handle the little sins.<br> [Singing] All through a lifetime<br> I'll be loving you and then<br> On the day after forever<br> I'll just begin<br> again<br> [Knocking on door]<br> Come in.<br> CAROL: Hello, Father.<br> O'MALLEY: Hello, Carol.<br> - Hi, Father.<br> - Hello.<br> - I heard you. That's more like it.<br> - Thank you, Father.<br> Maybe it's because I'm putting<br> more meaning into the words.<br> O'MALLEY: Very nice here, isn't it?<br> Very nice.<br> - Before you go any further...<br> - You mean it's all in my mind?<br> That's right.<br> Yes, I'm sure Father is just dying<br> to hear more of the details.<br> - Yes.<br> - Won't you sit down?<br> I was going down the street,<br> minding my own business, too...<br> when who do you think just happened by,<br> purely by accident, of course...<br> and pulled up alongside of the curb?<br> - Ted Haines, Jr.<br> - Right.<br> And what do you think his approach was?<br> You tell him.<br> - I prefer not to remember.<br> - Well, being a woman, I do.<br> His exact words were,<br> "Hey, good-looking, what's cooking?"<br> Now wait a minute.<br> What I really said was,<br> "Who do you know that I know?"<br> You know, that's worse.<br> Well, that was that.<br> And with practically no more of a build up<br> than that, he asked me to lunch.<br> Who knows? It might have worked.<br> It's been known to.<br> So after I'd cooled him off, I came back here.<br> No job, no money,<br> expecting to be thrown out any minute.<br> There was a knock on the door. I said<br> to myself, "The landlord. Here it comes."<br> - And who do you think was there?<br> - Junior?<br> - Right. I was so surprised.<br> - So was I.<br> Well, up to here, we're all surprised.<br> Naturally, before throwing me out,<br> he had to know a little about me.<br> So in a few well-chosen sentences,<br> I gave him the details.<br> Sort of like I told you.<br> And you found a landlord<br> with a heart of gold.<br> Well, not exactly a heart of gold,<br> Father, but...<br> Well, we had the apartment vacant,<br> and it seemed a shame to throw her out.<br> - Anyway, what's wrong with that?<br> - Nothing that I know of, up to here.<br> As I was saying,<br> it was a shame to throw her out.<br> Like Mrs. Quimp?<br> Yeah. No! Well, that's different.<br> I can see that, obviously.<br> She told me about coming to see you<br> and that you wanted to help her.<br> You don't have a corner on helping people,<br> do you?<br> And besides, I've practically<br> got her lined up in a job.<br> Yes, and as soon as I get it,<br> I'm going to pay him back.<br> Every nickel of it. You too, Father.<br> No hurry about me.<br> Rather a nice-looking piano you have here.<br> Well, she needs one, doesn't she?<br> - She's got to practice. She's a singer.<br> - It was very thoughtful.<br> Of course, pianos are a little expensive<br> these days.<br> I asked her first<br> if she couldn't play a ukulele.<br> - Well, then naturally...<br> - Yeah, naturally.<br> Carol tells me you can play, Father.<br> How about trying it out<br> to see if I got a good buy?<br> Yes, play something for us, Father.<br> [Playing soft music]<br> Would you mind us asking you<br> a few questions, Father?<br> - No.<br> - Where'd you get that wicked left hand?<br> Well, I've always been interested in music.<br> Used to write a bit of it at school.<br> I had a little band.<br> We used to play for the school dances.<br> O'Malley's Orioles.<br> [Playing upbeat music]<br> You know, at one time<br> I had quite a decision to make:<br> Whether to write the nation's songs<br> or go my way.<br> - Any regrets, Father?<br> - Regrets? No.<br> I get a great happiness<br> out of helping people realise that...<br> religion doesn't have to be this.<br> [Playing sombre music]<br> Taking all the fun out of everything.<br> It can be bright.<br> Bring you closer to happiness.<br> Do you go to church, Ted?<br> Or would you rather I change the subject?<br> If I could just express musically<br> what I have in my mind...<br> it would be much more eloquent.<br> It would sound simpler,<br> and you'd remember it.<br> Sometimes the spoken word<br> can be pretty dull.<br> You mean, sing your sermons, Father?<br> Yeah, sort of.<br> CAROL: Have you<br> had anything published?<br> No.<br> Will you play us<br> one of your unpublished ones?<br> [Singing] This road leads to Rainbowville<br> going my way?<br> Up ahead is Bluebird Hill<br> going my way?<br> Just pack a basket full of wishes<br> and off you start<br> With Sunday morning<br> in your heart<br> Round the bend you'll see a sign<br> "Dreamer's Highway"<br> Happiness is down the line<br> going my way?<br> The smiles you gather<br> will look well<br> on you<br> Oh, I hope you're<br> going my way<br> too<br> I think I'll leave you on that.<br> Goodbye, Carol.

We're raffling it off.<br> Again?<br> [Clicking tongue]<br> We're trying to raise a little money,<br> Father O'Dowd.<br> I see.<br> - How many?<br> - I'll take them all. How much are they?<br> Be $10.<br> - Thank you, and I hope you win it.<br> - Thank you.<br> And I hope you win it, too, Jenny.<br> Then perhaps you'll donate it to our church.<br> O'DOWD: And we can raffle it off over there<br> all over again.<br> I'd hate to see that crazy quilt<br> leaving the parish.<br> O'DOWD: Where's the pied piper<br> and his merry men?<br> Down in the basement.<br> Thank you, Father.

I have a little song here<br> that Timmy's going to take to a publisher.<br> A very good friend of his.<br> If he likes it, that might be the answer<br> to all our troubles.<br> I have bad news. I've been to the publisher.<br> He wasn't interested.<br> Wouldn't even look at it.<br> Said they were loaded up.<br> May I see it?<br> - So you're still in trouble.<br> - Wouldn't even look at it?<br> - He glanced at it.<br> - What'd he have to say?<br> - "Schmaltz isn't selling this season."<br> - What are they buying?<br> - "Barfola."<br> - No, I think they call it "Voffala."<br> Yeah, Voffala.<br> Boy, I heard some of their song hits.<br> It Was Hut-Sut Time On The Rilla-Rye.<br> And then there was another one.<br> I couldn't understand the words.<br> This fella lost his girl in Salt Lake City.<br> Then he goes on to say<br> the altitude is 5,400 feet.<br> The average temperature, 73.<br> The section is noted for gold, silver,<br> copper, grain.<br> But that doesn't make<br> any difference to this fella...<br> because he's lost his sugar.<br> - Voffala.<br> - Well, I know what Voffala is.
