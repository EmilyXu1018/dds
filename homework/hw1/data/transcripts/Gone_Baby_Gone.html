I just...<br> I think Nick was expecting<br> an older couple, maybe.<br> Life's full of surprises.<br> Corwin Earle.<br> Serial molester, recently work-released.<br> Went AWOL around the time<br> Amanda disappeared.<br> Known associates, Leon Trett<br> and his handsome wife, Roberta.<br> The Tretts were released six<br> and eight months ago, respectively.<br> They have drug habits.<br> We don't know where they are,<br> but we think Corwin's with them.<br> Jailhouse snitch claims<br> that Corwin confided in him<br> and told him when he got out,<br> he was gonna move in with his family.<br> Apparently the three of them<br> have some kind of<br> Addams Family deal going on.<br> Corwin's plan is to keep a kid<br> in the house to have sex with.<br> - Well, that sounds promising.<br> - Not for Amanda, it doesn't.<br> Do you think<br> this is who has Amanda?<br> Well, there's a lot<br> of holes in our theory.<br> I mean, Corwin likes<br> little boys, you know?<br> He likes them seven or eight or nine.<br> So that's it, that's all we got,<br> there's no other leads, three days in?<br> No, we got more.<br> We got six psychics telling us to look<br> in six different states,<br> we got Lionel and Bea<br> with airtight alibis,<br> we've interviewed every neighbor<br> in a mile radius<br> and we got a convicted finger-blaster<br> who just happened<br> to cut off his ankle bracelet.<br> - Take it easy...<br> - No, no, no, no, no!<br> Who the fuck is this guy?<br> You're here because Jack Doyle<br> had us extend you a courtesy.<br> You got something to contribute,<br> you know, be my guest.<br> Otherwise, hey, you...<br> You know, you can go back<br> to your Harry Potter book.<br> Isn't it usually somebody<br> who knows the victim?<br> I think there's plenty of people<br> in Helene McCready's life<br> that are capable of doing this.<br> So then you probably<br> talked to Ray Likanski.<br> - Who?<br> - Ray Likanski.<br> "Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",<br> about 160 pounds.<br> Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?<br> - Never heard of him.<br> - Well, with all due respect,<br> I think we might be able<br> to contribute on that point.<br> - Really? How's that?<br> - The night Amanda went missing,<br> Skinny Ray was down<br> at the Fillmore Lounge<br> doing coke for two hours,<br> between 8:00 and 10:00.<br> Fascinating.<br> - With Helene McCready.<br> - You're shitting me.<br> She did bullshit us.<br> I'm gonna have to tear her<br> a new asshole.<br> Meet you down there.<br> So what kinda name is Bressant?<br> It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.<br> Oh, yeah?<br> Thought you were from here.<br> Well, it all depends<br> on how you look at it.<br> I mean, you might think that you're<br> more from here than me, for example.<br> But I been living here<br> longer than you been alive.<br> So who's right?<br> I'll mull it over.<br> - What's up, sucker?<br> - Bubba.<br> - Good to see you, brother.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - How you been?

Just this one, Corwin Earle.<br> The other two are just baseheads<br> he hangs out with.<br> What are the two of yas,<br> crime dogs, now?<br> We got hired to find that little girl.<br> Turns out the mother was down<br> at the Fillmore all night<br> while the kid was taken.<br> - With Skinny Ray.<br> - Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.<br> - I thought Ray was your boy.<br> - Work for me?<br> Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.<br> He works for the Haitian.<br> Ray works for Cheese?<br> Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,<br> whole trash-picker crew.<br> Did you ever sell to Helene?<br> There's reasons why<br> there ain't three inches of Plexiglas<br> between us right now.<br> That's 'cause I don't fuck<br> with skeezers like Helene.<br> Or coconuts like Cheese.<br> You should know better by now.<br> I'm the king of this<br> motherfucking jungle.<br> I'll let you know<br> if I hear anything, though.<br> - Thanks, bro.<br> - Peace.<br> How well do you know<br> "Cheese" Jean Baptiste?<br> How well do you know<br> "Cheese" Jean Baptiste?<br> - Who?<br> - Come on, sweetheart.<br> "Cheese" Jean Baptiste?<br> Oh, sounds familiar.<br> No. No.<br> It don't "sound familiar," Helene.<br> He's a violent, sociopathic<br> Haitian criminal named "Cheese."<br> Either you know him or you don't.<br> Who is he?<br> He's a drug lord<br> or something, isn't he?<br> Helene, who is he?<br> - He's just a guy, Lionel.<br> Thank you.<br> He is, among other things,<br> Mrs. McCready, a drug dealer, yes.<br> - What other things?<br> - I don't know.<br> Why don't you answer<br> your brother's questions, Helene?<br> Why don't you go<br> suck a nigger's dick, Bea?<br> You listen to me!<br> You don't disrespect my wife,<br> and you don't make racial remarks<br> in my kitchen.<br> - Who is this man?<br> - It's my kitchen, Lionel.<br> You know what I mean!<br> Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.<br> Take it easy.<br> He's a drug dealer, a pimp,<br> a pornographer. All right?<br> Perfect.<br> You associate with a pimp.<br> A pornographer? Helene.<br> And we think he rolled up<br> Pokey Jackson in a carpet<br> and shot him in the head<br> on Castlegate, so there's that, too.<br> What do you do for him?<br> I just mule.<br> Occasionally, not making<br> a habit out of it.<br> Jesus, Mary and Joseph.<br> Lionel, what does that mean?<br> It means she's a drug runner, Bea.<br> It means she carries drugs.<br> - Isn't that right, Helene?<br> - Oh, my God, a few times.<br> - Where?<br> - Providence...<br> Does it fucking matter?<br> You think I'm fucking around, here?<br> You think I'm playing games, here?<br> 'Course it matters.<br> Better answer<br> his question, Helene.<br> - For what?<br> - Fuck's sake, Lionel.<br> - What do you think? Money, taste.<br> - Of what, drugs?<br> No, little puffy heart stickers<br> for my locker.<br> What kind of drugs?<br> Cocaine and heroin.<br> - No, I would've seen the track marks.<br> - Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?<br> Yeah, less addictive that way.<br> Piece of work.<br> What the fuck is that?<br> Where are you going?<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I keep thinking about this thing I heard.<br> - You know where I'm going with this?<br> - No.<br> Did you know I used to work DCU?<br> - I give a fuck.<br> - Okay.<br> So, I still know some of those guys<br> real well.<br> Anyway, I heard someone<br> ripped Cheese off<br> on a New Hampshire run.<br> - Did you hear anything about that?<br> No.<br> - Care to take a polygraph?<br> - I already took one.<br> Different questions this time.<br> Come on. It's all right.<br> We don't care about a<br> couple of hopheads beating each other.<br> We care about your child.<br> So come on.<br> How much?<br> You even give a fuck about your kid?<br> 'Course I do.<br> And we know you took the money.<br> So just tell us how much you took.<br> How much?<br> How much?<br> How much?<br> One thirty.<br> - $ 130,000?<br> - Yes, Bea.<br> How'd you do it?<br> Me and Ray had to do this<br> run up Nashua, right?<br> Yeah.<br> We dropped four ki's on these bikers.<br> When we was walking back<br> through the motel with all the money,<br> these cops just swooped right in,<br> went right for the bikers,<br> and Amanda was with us,<br> so we just pretended to be like a family.<br> - And we got in the car, took off.<br> - You took Amanda with you?<br> Oh, what am I gonna do?<br> Leave her in the car, Bea?<br> I don't got no daycare.<br> It's really hard being a mother.<br> It's hard raising a family, you know?<br> All on my own.<br> But God made you barren,<br> so you wouldn't fucking know.<br> - So I understand, Bea, okay?<br> - You are an abomination.<br> - Hey, hey, hey. Right here.<br> As God is my witness.<br> Right here. What happened next?<br> We was driving back,<br> and Ray, fucking Ray was like,<br> "You know everyone's gonna think<br> the cops got the money."<br> You told Cheese the cops got it.<br> But you and Ray<br> kept the money.<br> - This whole fucking thing is Ray's fault.<br> - Where's the money now, Helene?<br> - It's with Ray.<br> - And where's Ray?<br> - Chelsea.<br> - Let's go. Come on.<br> She rides with you.<br> I don't want her in my car.<br> - Go on. Move your bike!<br> - Go fuck your mother.<br> - What the...<br> - Beat it, sucker!<br> Helene, you used to go<br> with Scott Flaherty, didn't you?<br> - How do you know?<br> - You know, I went to Saint Mark's.<br> I was a freshman when you were<br> a senior. You don't remember me?<br> No.<br> Whatever happened to Scott?<br> He stabbed a foreign exchange student<br> in the chest.<br> He got life in Walpole.<br> He's a faggot now.<br> He was kind of a faggot in high school.<br> Oh, man.<br> You're terrible. He was cute.<br> Well, he kind of wore them tight shorts.<br> Oh, who's a faggot now?<br> You're dating a faggot.<br> So, how did the...<br> How'd the money end up in Chelsea?<br> I thought youse and...<br> You and Ray went home after.<br> No, we dropped off Amanda<br> and went back to Ray's.<br> But fucking retarded Ray<br> left his baby rock at my place.<br> You know, right then, I'm like,<br> "I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.<br> "I don't care if he does got a big dick."<br> So we went back to the apartment<br> and Ray was hollering,<br> he was gonna wake up Amanda,<br> she needs her sleep, you know?<br> So, we went back to Ray's,<br> - or Ray's mother's. Whatever.<br> - Yeah?<br> I don't know where that mother went,<br> but she left all her fucking cats in there,<br> and it smells like cock.<br> And Cheese never contacted you,<br> never left you a note?<br> No.<br> We didn't hear nothing from Cheese.<br> That's why Ray said, "Don't say shit."<br> You didn't think it was worth it<br> for your daughter's sake<br> to tell people what happened?<br> Cheese has your kid.<br> God fucking knows<br> what he's doing to her.<br> What am I gonna do?<br> Call Cheese and be like,<br> "You got my daughter?<br> "'Cause I just ripped you off,<br> and I'm just checking."<br> Yeah!<br> - Helene, sit back.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> Oh, I'm gonna call the cops, too,<br> and be like, "You know,<br> "just so you know, wanna know<br> I run coke and heroin<br> "in case that's irrelevant."<br> All right, calm down.<br> Calm down.<br> You make me sick.<br> What makes you think Ray hasn't<br> spent all the money, Helene?<br> Nigger, please. I hid it.<br> Pull over.<br> Looks like somebody had a little talk<br> with Ray before they shot him.<br> - Looks like he held out pretty good.<br> - He didn't have it.<br> He couldn't tell them where the money<br> was, because he didn't know.<br> Helene hid it.<br> Ray made poor relationship choices.<br> Guess they didn't believe him.<br> Poor prick.<br> I'm not waiting<br> in a fucking car.<br> - Where's the money, Helene?<br> - I give a fuck about the money.<br> - Helene...<br> - I just want my daughter home with me.<br> I know it. I know, I'm... I'm sorry.<br> It's very upsetting about Ray. But...<br> - Where's the money?<br> - It's right there.<br> - Where?<br> - Buried it when Ray was passed out.<br> What was that book about,<br> Everything You Need<br> Is in Your Own Backyard?<br> - I think it was a French book.<br> - Yeah, that wasn't a book.<br> - That was a book.<br> - No, it was a cartoon.<br> - The fuck out of here.<br> - No, it was a cartoon.<br> - Right, Helene?<br> - Fuck youse both.<br> Should we bring in the FBI<br> at this point?<br> - That's the worst thing we could do.<br> - Why is that?<br> 'Cause I don't wanna see Cheese<br> kill Amanda<br> after he opens a bag<br> full of newspapers.<br> It's kidnapping.<br> - I don't see a note. You see a note?<br> - Nope. No note.<br> We're investigating<br> a missing children's case, here.<br> Kidnapping has nothing to do with it.<br> Fastest way to get Amanda home<br> is go to Cheese,<br> swap the money for her and walk away.<br> - Plain and simple.<br> - Do you know Cheese?<br> Knew his brother better, Jude.<br> He was a sweet kid.<br> Cheese went another way.<br> - He wouldn't hurt her, right?<br> Ask Ray.<br> All right, listen.<br> All he cares about is his money.<br> If he gets it back...<br> He's not gonna hurt Amanda.<br> Just keep your mouth shut, okay?<br> We'll get her back. It'll be fine.<br> - Oh, you're gonna talk to him?<br> - Yeah, that's the idea.<br> Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?<br> I mean, he knows me,<br> just tell him I apologize.<br> Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.<br> Just take her home.<br> - We'll take care of this, all right?<br> - We'll meet you over there.<br> I'm hungry.<br> All right. I'll get you something, Helene.<br> No, her.<br> That's what she said to me<br> right before I put her to bed.<br> She said, "I'm hungry."<br> I mean, they fed her, right?<br> She's not still hungry?<br> I don't know.<br> I know I fucked up.<br> I just want my daughter back.<br> I swear to God,<br> I won't use no drugs no more.<br> I won't even go out,<br> I'll be fucking straight.<br> Cross my heart.<br> It's all right.<br> We're gonna find her, Helene.<br> You have to. You promise?<br> Yeah. I'm gonna try. I will.<br> Promise. You have to promise me.<br> I promise.<br> All right.<br> Where do you<br> think you're going?<br> Talk to Cheese.<br> No, you're not.<br> No, get back in the car.<br> No, that's a mistake.<br> He's never gonna talk to a badge.<br> No. No way.<br> It's too important.<br> You wanna get the girl back, or not?<br> I know him.<br> If there's a deal to be brokered,<br> - we're the ones who can do it.<br> - No, me and Nick are handling this.<br> Get back in the car.<br> Guys, you two go in there<br> and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,<br> then it is the FBI.<br> 'Cause it's kidnapping.<br> All you're gonna do<br> is scare him.<br> The more you scare him,<br> the worse it is for her.<br> All right. Go ahead.<br> Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.<br> I'm gonna take care of it.<br> Good luck.<br> It's been a long time.<br> No. I quit.<br> I'm gonna talk some private shit.<br> - Don't wait, but don't get too far.<br> - You know I'll be right here.<br> Bitches love the cheddar.<br> - How you been, Chris?<br> - Better than you.<br> Yeah. Good to hear it.<br> - Fuck you.<br> - Man, be cool.<br> It's been too long not to see a fool.<br> I grant you audience.<br> Go.<br> We found what you<br> were looking for in Chelsea.<br> What I care about Chelsea?<br> 'Cause one of the idiots<br> that robbed you lived there.<br> What idiot?<br> The one that you and Chris<br> beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.<br> I don't know about nobody getting kill.<br> But if somebody rob me<br> and end up dead...<br> Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.<br> Cheese, we got your money.<br> It was buried in Ray's backyard.<br> We wanna give it back to you<br> in exchange for Amanda McCready.<br> The two police outside<br> are the only other people who know.<br> No one gives a fuck<br> about what you did.<br> I mean, I didn't even<br> like Ray that much.<br> You're gonna get your money,<br> the mother gets her daughter back,<br> and we'll say we found the kid<br> in the bushes, or whatever.<br> It's either this, real quiet,<br> or it's a thousand fucking cops<br> kicking your door in,<br> putting their fat knees in your neck.<br> Hold up.<br> Whoa. Whoa.<br> What the fuck is this?<br> Lift up your shirt.<br> - Come on, man.<br> - Motherfucker, you heard me.<br> Lift up your shirt.<br> - It ain't like that, Cheese.<br> - My CC, I ain't down with you.<br> Lift up your shirt.<br> You, too, baby.<br> Ain't no gender immunity.<br> Let me see some tit.<br> Don't ever come in my spot like that.<br> You got my money,<br> you leave that shit in the mailbox<br> on your ass way out, you feel me?<br> Some other motherfuckers<br> let fool rob on them.<br> I don't play scrimmage.<br> But I don't fuck with no kids.<br> And if that girl only hope is you,<br> well, I pray for her,<br> 'cause she's gone, baby.<br> Gone.<br> Cheese, if you ever<br> disrespect her again like that,<br> I'm gonna pull your fucking card.<br> Okay?<br> So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.<br> We'll take your money,<br> and we'll be on our way.<br> But if it turns out you're lying,<br> I'm going to spend every nickel<br> of that money to fuck you up.<br> I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,<br> I'm gonna pay guys<br> to go after your weak fucking crew,<br> and I'm gonna tell everyone I know<br> that you're a CI and a rat.<br> And I know a lot of people.<br> And after that, you're gonna wish<br> you had listened to me,<br> 'cause your shitty, pool-hall,<br> crime-syndicate headquarters<br> is gonna get raided.<br> And your doped-up bitches<br> are gonna get sent back to Laos,<br> and this fucking retard right here<br> is gonna be testifying against you<br> for a reduced sentence while you're<br> getting cornholed in your cell<br> by a gang of crackers.<br> 'Cause from what I heard,<br> you guys that get sent up Concord<br> for killing kids,<br> life a motherfucker.<br> If I see you again,<br> I'm gonna get discourteous on you.<br> And get that sausage off my lawn.<br> Well, what happened?<br> - He said he didn't know anything,<br> but if you had his money,<br> you could put it in his mailbox.<br> - That's what he told you?<br> - That's it.<br> Nothing else?<br> Yeah. He said that he wanted<br> you two off his lawn.<br> I thought you said<br> you knew this fucking guy.<br> Half the guys he knows<br> are degenerates.<br> Yeah, you know<br> what the other half are?<br> - What?<br> - Cops. Don't hold it against me.<br> No, no. I won't hold it against you.<br> You know what I'll hold against you?<br> We had one chance to make this deal.<br> You said you knew him.<br> You said you could do it<br> and you fucked it up.<br> Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,<br> start surveillance,<br> hope to Christ we get lucky.<br> You know, if Amanda<br> dies because of this,<br> I won't have to hold it against you.<br> You'll hold it against yourself<br> for a long, long time.<br> Hope we didn't fuck this up.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Cheese called in.<br> Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,<br> but he wants to go tonight.<br> - Great.<br> - Well, it is and it isn't.<br> They record calls at the station now.<br> - Jack got a hold of the transcript.<br> - What does that mean?<br> It means our badges are<br> basically fucking forfeit at this point.<br> He wants you both down here, now.<br> Oh, and, hey, Cheese said<br> he left something in a mailbox<br> to prove that he's got Amanda.<br> This is a transcript of a recorded call<br> that came in this morning.<br> Care to read the highlighted portion?<br> Aloud?<br> Uh.<br> "Caller: Bitch,<br> you better have my money.<br> "Detective Bressant: Who is this?<br> "The caller:<br> You know who the fuck this is, fool...<br> "Creole curse words.<br> If you want that girl back,<br> "you need to meet me up<br> Quincy tonight.<br> "Fuck around for a minute<br> and I'll throw that girl in the lake."<br> The lake he refers to is the water<br> in the abandoned quarry.<br> Detective Bressant goes on to make<br> an unauthorized ransom arrangement<br> to exchange Amanda McCready<br> for $ 130,000 tonight<br> in just that location.<br> After some discussion,<br> Detective Bressant was kind enough<br> to produce this.<br> Recognize it?<br> The four of you have involved me<br> in an illegal activity<br> without my knowledge or consent,<br> and I don't fucking appreciate it.<br> - You don't have to be a part of it, sir.<br> - The hell I don't.<br> If I delay this now, after this agreement,<br> I just further endanger<br> the life of that child.<br> Does that sound like something<br> you expect me to do?<br> No, sir.<br> I went in there. I'll accept responsibility.<br> You'll accept nothing!<br> Don't come in here<br> trying to get noble, boy.<br> Let me see that note.<br> My God.<br> He wants to separate us.<br> The note instructs you guys to be<br> on the east side and wait for Amanda,<br> me and Nick to be at the clearing<br> by the edge with the money.<br> Once Amanda's turned over to you,<br> you give us a call on the radio,<br> we turn over the cash.<br> - Who's he likely to bring with him?<br> - Chris Mullen.<br> He was at the club<br> when we made the offer.<br> What do you know about him?<br> It was probably him<br> who killed Ray for Cheese.<br> If I had to guess.<br> All right.<br> Nobody else knows about this, right?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Yes?<br> I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better<br> for Amanda or is it better for us?<br> Do you have any children,<br> Miss Gennaro?<br> No, sir.<br> My only child was murdered.<br> She was 12. Did you hear about it?<br> What you probably didn't hear,<br> and what I hope<br> you never have to deal with,<br> Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.<br> What I have to deal with.<br> Knowing that my little girl likely died<br> crying out for me<br> to come and save her.<br> And I never did.<br> My little girl died afraid and alone<br> in a shallow ditch bank<br> by the side of the road<br> not 10 minutes from my house.<br> I know what it feels like to lose a child.<br> Now, damn it, you force my hand<br> and then you question<br> the way I handle it.<br> No one's questioning you, sir.<br> I honor my child with this division.<br> So that no parent<br> has to go through what I've known.<br> This child.<br> That's all I care about.<br> I'm gonna bring her home.<br> Why'd he bring us all the way up here?<br> I don't know. It's big. It's dark.<br> It's easy to get away.<br> No.<br> They're gonna kill her.<br> This asshole could've found<br> some level fucking ground somewhere.<br> This is where we part ways.<br> You guys'll be on top of that cliff.<br> We'll be right across from you.<br> Give us a call on the radio<br> when you have her.<br> - We will.<br> - Well, good luck.<br> Let's go.<br> How are they gonna<br> get Amanda up here?<br> Ambush! Ambush!<br> Hey, Remy! Fucking Cheese!<br> Where is she?<br> There she is.<br> I can see her.

Right there!<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, no.<br> Jesus Christ!<br> Paging<br> Dr. Goldsburn. Dr. Goldsburn to ICU.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - How's the leg?<br> - It'll be fine.<br> They find anything?<br> - They got divers in there now.<br> - She could still be alive.<br> Maybe she's hiding.<br> She could be stuck.<br> Right?<br> I don't think so.<br> Hey...<br> He's ever seen<br> in all his years,<br> on a little girl called Amanda<br> and a doll named Mirabelle.<br> This quarry is<br> extremely deep and treacherous.<br> All too often,<br> she keeps that which she takes in.<br> A sad end<br> to that story, Suzanne.<br> It sure is, Phil.<br> And Ron is next with<br> sports. The Bruins in action tonight?<br> Yes, they are, Phil.<br> The B's took a crack<br> at the Flyers tonight,<br> and the rough stuff started<br> in the first period.<br> And like that, she was gone.<br> We gave our statements.<br> Nick and Remy the same.<br> All of us spared any blame<br> for Amanda's death.<br> Jack Doyle resigned on the condition<br> that he and he alone<br> be held accountable.<br> The legendary captain<br> of a unit dedicated to children<br> stepped down today<br> in the aftermath of controversy.<br> He was granted<br> the dignity of early retirement.<br> But the humiliation of half a pension.<br> It was an ignominious end<br> to an illustrious career.<br> Chris' run lasted a day and a half until,<br> from what they could tell,<br> he ran into someone who wanted<br> the money more than he did.<br> Twenty-nine-year-old<br> Chris Mullen<br> was gunned down last night<br> in an apparent robbery.<br> The police commissioner<br> defended the rising tide of crime<br> as a statistical aberration tied<br> to growing unemployment<br> and the humidity of...<br> Enough time went by<br> and they called off the search.<br> They issued Helene<br> a death certificate.<br> The frame and the casket were<br> donated by the funeral home,<br> but had to be returned<br> at the end of the afternoon.<br> You know I love you, right?<br> Yeah.<br> I just wanna be alone for a while.<br> I don't know if she blamed<br> me or if she blamed herself.<br> But when she didn't think I was home,<br> or if she thought I couldn't hear,<br> she would cry.<br> I couldn't stop running it over<br> and over and over in my mind,<br> the vague and distant suspicion<br> that we never understood<br> what happened that night,<br> what our role was.<br> Or maybe it was just that,<br> like the hundreds of other children<br> who disappear each year<br> and never return...<br> Amanda was even more haunting<br> for never being found.<br> What they did find<br> was another big story,<br> and I couldn't help but find it strange.<br> Not two months later and not far away,<br> another child went missing.<br> ...and community watch patrols<br> are being formed.<br> A bicycle left<br> roadside. A tire left spinning.<br> Late-breaking news<br> on that story.<br> Little Johnny Pietro is also wearing<br> what this reporter believes<br> might be a sign.<br> Johnny Pietro was wearing the<br> medallion of St. Christopher,<br> patron saint of...<br> Johnny Pietro<br> and his medallion.<br> What I didn't find strange<br> was this time,<br> no relatives came knocking<br> on our door.<br> - Hey, Patrick.<br> - Hi.<br> - I need you to come on a ride with me.<br> - Where?<br> To Everett.<br> - What, no parties in Lynn?<br> - Funny.<br> - You got your toast with you, right?<br> - My what?<br> Your gun, dummy.<br> Yeah.<br> This ain't no<br> strip-clubbing in Lynn, Patrick.<br> I got something better for you, buddy.<br> You asked me to find<br> some people for you.<br> I think I found them.<br> What you getting me into?<br> You don't give a fuck about this<br> Corwin Earle dude no more?<br> Yo, 'cause the fat bitch<br> and the old dude are in there.<br> My man didn't know about the diddler.<br> Come in with me. Watch my side.<br> We'll find out<br> if this motherfucker's in there.<br> You know what, Patrick?<br> If you don't wanna come in,<br> you don't have to come in.<br> If you don't wanna come in, fuck it.<br> Let's go.<br> Guess who?<br> - Jerome Miller?<br> - No, it's the coke fairy.<br> - Open up.<br> - I got the money right here.<br> Marmaduke, you think you're gonna<br> hand me money on a fucking porch?<br> Open the door.<br> Who's he?<br> He's your father.<br> Open the fucking door!<br> - Look out.<br> - Okay, man!<br> Chill! Chill!<br> What are you guys, starting a band?<br> No one's starting a band.<br> It's a taste.<br> Cocaine for the old man.<br> Fucking Christ.<br> Want me to change<br> a roll of quarters for you, too?<br> I told you to tell me when they got here!<br> They just got here.<br> - You already did some!<br> - It was a taste bag.<br> Sorry, love.<br> Here, count this fucking mess.<br> Where's the rest, man?<br> As soon as he's finished counting<br> that fucking mess you gave me.<br> - Mr. Miller, do you mind?<br> - No, I don't mind.<br> - Excuse me!<br> - You're excused.<br> - Hey, please don't snoop around, sir.<br> Hey, relax, handsome.<br> Excuse me!<br> Where the fuck you think you're going?<br> Mr. Miller, I'm warning you!<br> Stop!<br> Patrick, shoot this bitch.<br> You fat busted cunt.<br> You put a gun on me, you better use it.<br> Just give us the fucking wizza!<br> You don't wanna shoot her, Patrick?<br> Who's this guy?<br> Corwin!<br> Go back to your room!<br> It's not a party?<br> No, it's not a party.<br> How much money's there, Patrick?<br> Enough.<br> Want this?<br> What are you doing?<br> Pick up the fucking money.<br> At least two guns in<br> the house. Roberta's carrying hers.<br> What else?<br> - Well, they're definitely high.<br> - On what?<br> - Cocaine.<br> Your friend tell you that, too?<br> SWAT'll be here in five minutes.<br> You're not gonna wait for them?<br> Did you or did you not tell me<br> you saw Corwin Earle<br> with the medallion of St. Christopher<br> around his fucking wrist?<br> I definitely saw Corwin Earle.<br> We're not waiting.<br> Stay here.<br> And don't fuck around, all right?<br> Good job.<br> Fuck.<br> An... An officer... Shots are fired!<br> An officer down... Shots...<br> Listen to me!<br> A police officer has been shot<br> at 33 German Road!<br> Get away from him!<br> It was an accident.<br> It was an accident.<br> Wait!<br> Hey.<br> You okay?<br> They told me what happened.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> That man killed a child.<br> He had no right to live.<br> - You're proud of me?<br> - Of course I am.<br> You did what you had to do.<br> Let's go home.<br> I gotta stay here awhile.<br> - See you at home.<br> - Yeah.<br> Thanks.<br> It was fucked up, right?<br> They tell you anything about Nick?<br> They said he could be okay.<br> I don't know.<br> They say how old that little boy was?<br> Seven.<br> Second grade.<br> Should be proud of yourself.<br> Most guys would've stayed outside.<br> I don't know.<br> What don't you know?<br> My priest says shame is God<br> telling you what you did was wrong.<br> Fuck him.<br> Murder's a sin.<br> Depends on who you do it to.<br> That's not how it works. It is what it is.<br> I planted evidence on a guy once,<br> back in '95.<br> We were paying $ 100<br> an eight-ball to snitches.<br> We got a call<br> from our pal, Ray Likanski.<br> He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.<br> Anyway, he tells us there's a guy<br> pumping up in an apartment<br> up in Columbia Point.<br> We go in, me and Nicky.<br> Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,<br> it was no joke.<br> So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?<br> The old lady's beat to shit,<br> the husband's mean, cracked out,<br> tries to give us trouble,<br> Nicky lays him down.<br> We're doing an inventory,<br> but it looks like we messed up<br> because there's no dope in the house,<br> and I go in the back room...<br> Now, this place<br> was a shithole, mind you.<br> Rats, roaches all over the place.<br> But the kid's room, in the back,<br> was spotless.<br> No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,<br> it was immaculate.<br> The little boy's sitting on the bed<br> holding onto his PlayStation<br> for dear life.<br> There's no expression on his face,<br> tears streaming down.<br> He wants to tell me he just learned<br> his multiplication tables.<br> Christ.<br> I mean, the father's got him<br> in this crack den,<br> subsisting on Twinkies<br> and ass-whippings,<br> and this little boy just wants someone<br> to tell him that he's doing a good job.<br> You're worried what's Catholic?<br> I mean, kids forgive.<br> Kids don't judge.<br> Kids turn the other cheek.<br> What do they get for it?<br> So I went back out there,<br> I put an ounce of heroin<br> on the living room floor,<br> and I sent the father on a ride,<br> seven to nine.<br> - That was the right thing?<br> - Fucking A!<br> You gotta take a side.<br> You molest a child, you beat a child,<br> you're not on my side.<br> If you see me coming, you better run,<br> because I am gonna<br> lay you the fuck down!<br> Easy.<br> Don't feel easy.<br> Is the kid better off without his father?<br> Yeah.<br> But okay, I mean,<br> could be out there right now,<br> pumping with a gun in his waistband.<br> It's a war, man.<br> Are we winning?<br> No.<br> Would you do it again?<br> Clip Corwin Earle?<br> No.<br> Does that make you right?<br> Hmm?<br> I don't know.<br> Doesn't make it wrong, though,<br> does it?<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> How's Remy?<br> He lied to me.<br> What did Remy say about Ray<br> back in Roxbury?<br> - Never heard of him.<br> - Never heard of him.<br> Now he says Ray's been snitching<br> for him for 15 years.<br> He called him his "old pal."<br> Said he couldn't find<br> enough people to snitch out.<br> Patrick...<br> And Ray Likanski is the reason<br> Amanda got taken in the first place,<br> and Remy lies about knowing him.<br> Let it go.<br> Why would he lie?<br> What's he have to hide?<br> Amanda's dead.<br> Let it go.<br> Babe.<br> Nick died.<br> Left. Left.<br> Mr. Kenzie.<br> Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.<br> Amen.<br> - Sorry about Nick.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> I was thinking about our conversation<br> the other night.<br> Well, I said some things<br> I shouldn't have.<br> You know, too much rum.<br> Yeah, like what?<br> Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.<br> Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.<br> Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?<br> Okay.<br> Forget about the other night,<br> and we'll be friends.<br> What if I don't?<br> That's not an "if"<br> you wanna bring into your life.<br> Had lunch with him last week.<br> Dana had lunch with him last week?<br> Excuse me.<br> Hey, Dev.<br> - Hey, how you doing?<br> - All right, how you been?<br> I can't complain.<br> - Can I talk to you?<br> - Yeah.<br> Not here.<br> If it's like that, then<br> you're gonna have to buy me lunch.<br> - How's the Chart House, half hour?<br> - Sounds about right.<br> Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics<br> with you, right?<br> DCU, yeah. What's up?<br> Why'd he leave?<br> Had a habit of just<br> rubbing people the wrong way.<br> Like what? What'd he do?<br> Like marry a prostitute, for one.<br> Come on.<br> Might not wanna do that<br> if you're a cop, right?<br> Might not wanna do that<br> if you're a plumber.<br> So, what happened?<br> He says he loves her,<br> tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,<br> and puts in for a transfer.<br> What, to Doyle?<br> Doyle brought Remy<br> from Louisiana, back in '72.<br> You don't think that Remy's<br> dirty, though, do you?<br> What's "dirty"?<br> - I know he planted evidence once.<br> - Oh, you do?<br> Yeah. Why?<br> Look, man. CSI is killing us out here.<br> Every other juror, all they wanna know<br> is where the microfibers are.<br> Certain people are workers.<br> Don't wanna plant it,<br> but you know how it is.<br> So they don't mind it.<br> So tell me something,<br> what you fucking with him for?<br> He lied to me.<br> I can't think of one reason<br> big enough for him to lie<br> that's small enough not to matter.<br> All right, look.<br> I know one thing, but it's third party,<br> so you gotta play it like that.<br> Helene and Ray took Cheese's money<br> back in June, right?<br> Yeah.<br> One week later,<br> Remy goes to a cop in DCU<br> asking if anybody knew<br> who robbed Cheese.<br> So what?<br> So my informant tells me,<br> Cheese didn't even know<br> he got robbed until two weeks later.<br> So Remy knew Cheese got robbed<br> before Cheese did?<br> How'd he know that?<br> Let me tell you something.<br> You better think long and hard<br> before you start running around here<br> investigating the police.<br> You try and take food out their mouths,<br> and they will fuck you up.<br> Thanks for the steak.<br> All right.<br> Hey.<br> I got it.<br> We need to talk to you, Lionel.<br> About what?<br> About the acoustics in your apartment.<br> What?<br> Oh, we live<br> in a three-decker, too, Lionel.<br> I got nothing to talk about.<br> Well, that's fine.<br> We can talk to the state police.<br> Meet me at Murphy's Law.<br> I don't meet him<br> down Murphy's,<br> he's gonna call the staties.<br> He's putting a<br> move on you. Don't go down there.<br> I can handle Patrick Kenzie.<br> - This is an oath we took.<br> - I started this.<br> - This has to be protected.<br> - I got things to protect, too.<br> - Listen to me!<br> - All right, Remy.<br> You leave that house,<br> you're an enemy to me.<br> - Just trust me, all right?<br> - No! Trust me!<br> Where I come from,<br> you die with your secrets!<br> How long have you known Remy?<br> Detective Bressant? Just in...<br> Met him through<br> the investigation of Amanda.<br> - That's it?<br> - Yeah.<br> How long you known Remy?<br> What is this?<br> They got the Internet, now, Lionel.<br> You know how it is in town.<br> Everybody knows everybody.<br> No. Everybody don't know everybody.<br> - What're you talking about?<br> - Why you lying?<br> I'm not.<br> You bragged about taking a hard bust<br> on the first day we met you.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - Bullshit.<br> You're hiding something, Lionel,<br> and you better fucking tell it,<br> 'cause you came to our house<br> and you asked us for help.<br> And we killed ourselves<br> trying to save Amanda.<br> And I know you ain't being 100%<br> with me right now,<br> and it's really fucking pissing me off<br> that you're lying,<br> so you better interrupt me at any time,<br> 'cause I'm about to lose...<br> Okay. Fine, fine. All right?<br> Don't have a heart attack.<br> I haven't been honest with you.<br> It's just not something I'm proud of.<br> You know?<br> I got in a bar fight back in the day.<br> The other guy cracked his skull.<br> At some point,<br> I must've said, "I'll kill you."<br> So they had me up for attempted.<br> It's my word against this other guy's.<br> Witness testified to my version<br> and the jury believed him.<br> - 'Cause he was a cop.<br> - Yeah, he testified for me.<br> So you knew Detective Bressant.<br> - It's not like we were best friends.<br> - But you lied.<br> - Why did you call Remy?<br> - He's a cop.<br> - That's not why you called him, Lionel.<br> - Come on.<br> It's a small place.<br> You heard them arguing.<br> - They were being loud.<br> - Who? Who... Who...<br> So you called Remy, and you and him<br> took Amanda to blackmail your sister.<br> Why would I do that?<br> I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.<br> Maybe because after all the<br> "I put the fucking plug in the jug,"<br> and the "count your blessings"<br> and the "watch your language,"<br> you're just like everybody else.<br> You saw a bag of money<br> and you wanted it.<br> And you thought<br> you could get away with it.<br> But Bea called the media<br> and made a big thing of it.<br> And then she called us,<br> and then you were fucked.<br> The case is closed, Patrick.<br> The case is closed.<br> Coke-dealing Haitian's<br> a pretty easy target for a frame.<br> - Lionel?<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Look at me.<br> - Okay. Excuse me.<br> You took your niece,<br> and you laid it off on a black guy.<br> - Pardon me.<br> - Lionel, tell me what happened.<br> Can I get some service?<br> Yeah.<br> What?<br> - Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.<br> - Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> Just give me a second.<br> Twenty-three years<br> is something, right?<br> Go.<br> I come up to check on Amanda.<br> She was alone as usual.<br> I was reading her a story<br> when Helene and Ray come home.<br> They didn't know I was there.<br> Stop fucking yelling,<br> my daughter's sleeping in there.<br> They started talking about how<br> they'd robbed this drug dealer.<br> You know what he's fucking gonna do<br> if he finds out?<br> What's the monkey gonna do?<br> - Oh, you know...<br> - I'm not...<br> And they were talking<br> about leaving the state.<br> So I called Remy and told him.<br> There's another drug run<br> up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...<br> And then what?<br> We took her.<br> Remy laid out this plan.<br> It seemed easy.<br> We take her, force Helene and Ray<br> to cough up the cash,<br> then we put her back. You know?<br> Amanda gets to spend<br> a weekend in the country.<br> My sister learns a lesson.<br> And fuck it, everybody gets paid<br> on top of it.<br> I got no problem taking money<br> from a guy like Cheese.<br> They were gonna handle the cops.<br> But Bea, she went nuts.<br> Started calling the papers. Hired you.<br> Lionel don't want me coming here,<br> now you don't want the job?<br> But once you found the money,<br> they had Amanda and the money.<br> So they decided to set up<br> a fake exchange for you to witness.<br> They got Chris Mullen<br> to set up Cheese at the quarry.<br> Cheese figured out<br> what was happening.<br> Even though it was too late,<br> he started shooting.<br> Panicking.<br> And she just fell. I mean, she just...<br> She fell in.<br> She's gone.<br> It was an accident.<br> It was just an accident.<br> She was your sister's kid, Lionel.<br> - Your sister's child.<br> - You think I don't miss her?<br> She was more my kid than Helene's.<br> Last summer, Helene and Dottie<br> took Amanda to the beach.<br> It was a real hot day.<br> Amanda fell asleep.<br> They left her in the car<br> while they go off into the dunes,<br> smoke a doobie with some guys.<br> Two hours.<br> Amanda literally roasted.<br> She was three.<br> Later on, I was holding her,<br> trying to help her get to sleep.<br> My little Amanda, she was so hot.<br> She felt like something<br> just come out of the oven.<br> Like a fucking pot roast.<br> So don't feel too sorry for my sister.<br> Because she never gave a shit<br> about anyone but herself.<br> Bartender. Open the safe. Now.<br> Everybody needs to shut up and stay<br> calm. On the floor. On the floor!<br> - Hands on your head. Do it.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Everybody stays calm,<br> this'll be over in a minute.<br> Hey, do you know<br> whose bar this is, shithead?<br> Or you can get wise, it's up to you.<br> What did you say?<br> You're a talker, huh?<br> Just keep revving, motherfucker.<br> Don't antagonize him.<br> He's got a gun.<br> - Oh, just keep yapping away.<br> - I didn't say nothing.<br> You should learn<br> to keep your mouth shut.<br> Shut the fuck up,<br> for Christ's sake.<br> - Just keep talking, pal.<br> - I didn't say nothing.<br> Close your eyes.<br> - Fuck!<br> - Remy Bressant.<br> Amanda McCready<br> was taken by Remy Bressant.<br> Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready<br> was taken by Remy Bressant!<br> - Wait. Wait. Jesus.<br> Remy Bressant.<br> God damn it. Remy Bressant!<br> Amanda McCready was taken<br> - by Remy Bressant.<br> - Jesus. I told him.<br> I told him we took her for ransom.<br> I told him. I told him, Remy.<br> Please, I told him we took her<br> for ransom. I did it.<br> Remy, please.<br> Please.<br> Are you all right?<br> Stay with him.<br> Drop your gun.<br> Put it down!<br> That bartender wasn't fucking around.<br> What did you do?<br> Did you get her killed?<br> Say yes.<br> Say yes.<br> Say yes!<br> What're you gonna do? Shoot me?<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br> She was a child.<br> I love children.<br> Why would I expose a conspiracy<br> that I was a part of?<br> I mean, did Lionel contradict<br> anything I've said?<br> Did any of the witnesses at the bar<br> contradict anything I've said?<br> A police officer was killed today.<br> That's not looked on lightly.<br> Is corruption looked on lightly?<br> Is a little girl getting killed<br> looked on lightly?<br> Whoa, hold on.<br> You charge people money<br> as a detective.<br> Now, you're at the quarry<br> the other night, right?<br> And you have no idea<br> that this is a setup?<br> You're baffled. Right?<br> No, because, strange as it might seem,<br> I believe the police<br> when they tell me something.<br> You're a fresh prick. You know that?<br> And because I had a ransom note<br> and Amanda McCready's blanket<br> put in my mailbox.<br> And because I read a transcript of<br> a call that Cheese put into the station.<br> A 911 call?<br> No, it was a call<br> Cheese made to the station.<br> To Remy Bressant at the station.<br> Or that Chris Mullen made,<br> pretending to be Cheese.<br> Or whatever the fuck it was,<br> but it was recorded,<br> and there was a call.<br> We don't record calls<br> coming into the station,<br> and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.<br> So, did you hear a tape?<br> - No, I didn't hear a tape.<br> - Okay.<br> Did you see a transcript?<br> No, I must've remembered it wrong.<br> Kids forgive.<br> What do they get for it?<br> Amanda literally roasted.<br> You think I don't miss her.<br> She was more my kid than Helene's.<br> I love children.<br> This is the kind of thing that if you do,<br> Patrick, you wanna be sure.<br> Are you sure?<br> No.<br> Are you coming?<br> No.<br> Doyle brought Remy<br> from Louisiana back in '72.<br> Care to read<br> the highlighted portion?<br> Taking a trip?<br> Patrick Kenzie.<br> To what do I owe the pleasure?<br> Remy Bressant died last night.<br> I was told. It's a shame.<br> Yeah, it's hard to understand.<br> Because he seemed like a good man.<br> He was a good man.<br> We don't know<br> why people do what they do.<br> Everybody looks out his own window.<br> And everyone's got their reasons.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> - How are you?<br> - Good.<br> Nick! They're firing at me.<br> Nick, you hear me? You okay?<br> They're firing at me!<br> Remy!<br> - I heard something go in the water!<br> - Ambush! Ambush!<br> - Something went in!<br> - Run. Remy. Run!<br> Panicking.<br> Amanda got scared.<br> She started running.<br> She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.<br> Twenty-nine-year-old<br> Chris Mullen<br> was gunned down last night<br> in an apparent robbery.<br> You go back inside with Frannie.<br> Papa will come in soon.<br> Make you a sandwich, okay?<br> - All right.<br> - That's my girl.<br> Don't go down there.<br> If I think he has the evidence,<br> I'll take the hit.<br> I got no problem doing the time.<br> Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.<br> All right.<br> I got things to protect, too.<br> You leave that house,<br> you're an enemy to me<br> and you're a danger to Amanda.<br> Please, I told him<br> we took her for ransom. I did it.<br> I told him. Remy, please.<br> So now you know.<br> My sister's not stable.<br> She's on crack.<br> She's talking about leaving the state.<br> I'm scared for my niece.<br> - Who's gonna take care of her?<br> - We'll do something.<br> We'll figure it out.<br> She's an addict.<br> Bigot. Drug mule.<br> The child will be dead<br> or on the street in 10 years.<br> What about the uncle?<br> He can never tell anyone.<br> Not even his wife.<br> Or he'll never see her again.<br> It's worth it to him.<br> Know she'll have a better life.<br> Do one last good thing<br> before we hang it up.<br> How many children<br> have we seen destroyed?<br> Enough.<br> Does it make you feel better?<br> Telling yourself you did it<br> for the right reasons?<br> That you took her to be saved.<br> From her own mother?<br> We're just trying to give<br> a little girl a life.<br> Wasn't your life to give.<br> Helene's her mother.<br> If you thought she was a bad mother,<br> you should've gone to Social Services.<br> Short of that, she's her mother,<br> and that's where she belongs.<br> You turn around.<br> You go back to your fucking car,<br> and you wait 30 years.<br> You don't know<br> what the world is made of yet.<br> I'm calling state police in five minutes.<br> They'll be here in ten.<br> Thought you would've<br> done that by now.<br> You know why you haven't?<br> Because you think<br> this might be an irreparable mistake.<br> Because deep inside you, you know<br> it doesn't matter what the rules say.<br> When the lights go out<br> and you ask yourself,<br> "Is she better off here or better off<br> there," you know the answer.<br> And you always will.<br> You... You could do a right thing here.<br> A good thing.<br> Men live their whole lives<br> without getting this chance.<br> You walk away from it,<br> you may not regret it<br> when you get home.<br> You may not regret it for a year,<br> but when you get to where I am,<br> I promise you, you will.<br> I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...<br> She'll be dragging around a couple of<br> tattered, damaged children of her own,<br> and you'll be the one<br> who has to tell them you're sorry.<br> You know what? Maybe that'll happen.<br> And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,<br> and I'll live with it.<br> But what's never gonna happen<br> and what I'm not gonna do<br> is have to apologize<br> to a grown woman<br> who comes to me and says,<br> "I was kidnapped<br> when I was a little girl,<br> "and my aunt hired you to find me.<br> "And you did, you found me<br> with some strange family.<br> "But you broke your promise<br> and you left me there.<br> "Why?
