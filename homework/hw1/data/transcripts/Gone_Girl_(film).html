Year four, flowers.<br> She led me outside<br> to the dying rosebush in the backyard.<br> That's symbolic.<br> Yeah.<br> What's the gift for five?<br> Wood.<br> - So, what did you get her?<br> - There's no good gift for wood.<br> I know!

Very meta.<br> Thanks.<br> Pretty things.<br> Stay.<br> My office, here.<br> Beautiful dress.<br> Date night?<br> It's our anniversary.<br> It's a guest bedroom, there.<br> Cat's room on the end.<br> I checked up here.<br> This is the kitchen...<br> Obviously.<br> This is my wife's office.<br> Amy's office.<br> Wow. Impressive gal.<br> Yeah. Should I be concerned?<br> I remember these.<br> I loved these books.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Your wife is amazing Amy?<br> Yeah. She is.<br> Wow.<br> Amazing-fucking-Amy<br> is getting fucking married.<br> That's how the night started.<br> With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,<br> jealous, as always, of the golden child.<br> Perfect, brilliant, amazing Amy,<br> who's getting fucking married.<br> When I was 10, I quit cello.<br> In the next book,<br> amazing Amy became a prodigy.<br> Did you play volleyball?<br> I got cut, freshman year.<br> She made varsity.<br> When did you have a dog?<br> She got the dog.<br> Puddles made her more relatable.<br> Wow.<br> I love your parents...<br> But they really can be assholes.<br> - Nick!<br> - Sir!<br> Hey, thanks for coming, man.<br> No problem.<br> Hey, sweetheart.<br> Big night for your mom.<br> It would mean so much<br> if you would talk to a few reporters...<br> Bloggers, give them a little Amy color.<br> People wanna hear from you.<br> - We can't stay long.<br> - Fantastic.<br> Fifteen minutes, tops.<br> This is why I have my brownstone.<br> My trust fund. I know I can't complain.<br> Your parents literally<br> plagiarized your childhood.<br> No, they improved upon it,<br> and then peddled it to the masses.<br> I thought you were gonna wear white<br> to match the wedding theme.<br> I thought that would be creepy.<br> "If it's worth doing,<br> it's worth doing..."<br> hold up! I know how this ends.<br> Don't tell me.<br> You're very cute, Nick.<br> Amy, you know<br> what would make dad's night.<br> I'm on it.<br> I love having strangers<br> pick at my scabs.<br> I'm curious whether...<br> It's difficult for you to see<br> amazing Amy heading down the aisle.<br> And this big party<br> celebrating this fictional wedding.<br> Because it's my understanding<br> you are not married.<br> Is that correct?<br> Correct. Amazing Amy has always been<br> one step ahead of me.<br> Excuse me. I'm sorry,<br> I just have a few questions.<br> It's you.<br> I'm here in a<br> strictly journalistic capacity.<br> Now, you had the distinct pleasure<br> of dating Nick dunne for how long?<br> - Two magical years.<br> - Two magical years.<br> In the course of that time,<br> you've had the opportunity...<br> To perform such gracious gestures as...<br> Not correcting Nick when he<br> pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."<br> An understandable mistake.<br> He also thought it was a fish.<br> He thinks velveeta is a cheese.<br> You also manage to appear<br> shocked and delighted...<br> When Nick's elderly mother<br> breaks into an impromptu rendition...<br> Of New York, New York,<br> every time she sees you.<br> These bag of bone shoes<br> that's just frightening.<br> You also bought Nick<br> his very first pair of scissors.<br> And matching stapler.<br> Amy elliott, you are more than amazing.<br> You are brilliant,<br> yet entirely un-snobby.<br> You challenge me. You surprise me.<br> And, fun fact for the readers...<br> You have a world-class vagina.<br> My colleagues tell me<br> that you are not yet married.<br> Is that correct?<br> I'm not.<br> Isn't it time we fixed that?<br> And then...<br> The night wasn't so bad anymore.<br> And it's done. Crossed off the list.<br> Now, normally, we would not treat this<br> as a missing persons case so quick...<br> But given the scene at your house...<br> And given our spike<br> in violent crime of late...<br> We are gonna take this<br> very, very seriously.<br> Okay. Good.<br> We've got forensics over at your place.<br> You got somewhere to stay?<br> - I could stay at my sister's.<br> - Okay.<br> We're tracking Amy's phone,<br> her credit cards.<br> We will organize searches,<br> put up flyers.<br> We're gonna hold a press<br> conference tomorrow.<br> You're having a<br> press conference?<br> I wanna get the word out, right?<br> Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,<br> I feel like I'm on a law & order episode.<br> Time is of the essence in these cases.<br> But, that said,<br> do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?<br> Absolutely not. I just wanna help.<br> So, you and Amy<br> have been here two years.<br> - You tend bar...<br> - I own the bar.<br> And I teach creative writing at mvcc.<br> - No kids?<br> - Not yet.<br> So, what does Amy do most days?<br> A woman with all those degrees,<br> what does she do?<br> I don't know. She keeps busy.<br> Doing what?<br> She's a voracious reader.<br> So, she's always got a book in her hand.<br> Well, days can get long.<br> I know a few housewives,<br> that evening<br> glass of wine starts<br> coming at noon.<br> Or prescription pills.<br> Just last week, we had a soccer mom.<br> Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in<br> over some oxycontin.<br> Ever since that mall went bust,<br> half the town is out of work.<br> We cannot keep up<br> with the drug violence.<br> I'm pretty sure that's not it.<br> Has Amy got friends we can talk to?<br> No, not really.<br> No friends? This whole town?<br> She was very close with my mom,<br> before she passed away.<br> You know, we have a pretty serious<br> homeless problem...<br> In our neighborhood.<br> I think maybe you guys<br> should check that out.<br> We'll look into that.<br> You got to the bar around 11:00 today.<br> Where were you before that?<br> Just to cross that out.<br> Well, I was home.<br> I left at 9:30,<br> I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.<br> I went to Sawyer beach<br> and read the news.<br> Did you visit with anyone there?<br> I kind of go to Sawyer beach<br> for the solitude.<br> So, your wife has no friends here.<br> Is she kinda standoffish?<br> Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?<br> She's from New York.<br> She's complicated.<br> She's got very high standards.<br> Type a?<br> That can make you crazy<br> if you're not like that.<br> You seem pretty laid-back. Type b.<br> Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?<br> God, I don't know.<br> I'd have to look it up at the house.<br> You don't know if she has friends,<br> you don't know what she does all day...<br> And you don't know<br> your wife's blood type.<br> Sure you all are married?<br> Maybe it's type o.<br> - Where are her folks? New York?<br> - Yeah.<br> Can they get here time<br> for this press conference tomorrow?<br> Tomorrow? I have no idea.<br> I haven't talked to them.<br> You haven't called<br> your wife's parents yet?<br> You can't get a signal in this building.<br> I've been in here talking to you.<br> Call them, please, Nick. Now.<br> Fine.<br> Should I know my wife's blood type?<br> No.<br> I apologize, marybeth.<br> I didn't know what was going on.<br> Now I'm at the station...<br> And the cops are at the house,<br> and it's serious and I'm calling you.<br> There's a lot of things<br> that are being juggled right now.<br> I'm standing right next to<br> detective Rhonda boney...<br> Who's the lead investigator on this<br> and she's...<br> My mother-in-law<br> would like to speak with you.<br> This is detective boney.<br> I wanna go home.<br> I don't know why I have to be here.<br> I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.<br> Dad?<br> This is my father. What's going on?<br> Really? You're Nick dunne?<br> We've been trying to get a hold of you<br> all afternoon.<br> I've been right there.<br> My wife is missing.<br> - Bitch.<br> - Don't.<br> Your father wandered out of comfort hill<br> after lunch.<br> We found him walking route 79,<br> disoriented.<br> We've been trying to call you<br> for the last...<br> I don't get a cell signal<br> in this building.<br> I've been sitting<br> Sir, please<br> don't take that tone with me.<br> Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.<br> Dad, stop.<br> You wanna drive him home?<br> I think that would be wise. Thanks.<br> This voice mailbox is currently full.<br> Fuck.<br> Get your fucking hands off me.<br> Thanks.<br> Everyone told us<br> and told us and told us...<br> Marriage is hard work.<br> And compromise and more work.<br> "Abandon all hope, ye who enter."<br> "When young Amy's hope did wane...<br> "She wandered here..."<br> Well, it's not true.<br> Not for me and Nick.<br> "...in search of Jane."<br> With us, two years...<br> It's just good.<br> Austen.<br> You were an alienated teen<br> and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.<br> Look at that.<br> My God.<br> You naughty minx.<br> Well, technically, we are supposed<br> to fuck at the next stop.<br> Yeah, in keeping with tradition.<br> But I might be willing<br> to bend the rules this once.<br> God bless Jane Austen.<br> I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.<br> It's confirmed by the...<br> Thank you.<br> Year two. Cotton.<br> We had that joke that our sex<br> was too good for ordinary.<br> So, these are 2,000 thread-count...<br> we're so cute.<br> I wanna punch us in the face.<br> That's pretty great.<br> I mean, that is pretty great.<br> Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?<br> I don't need a lawyer.<br> Here, I'll do this.<br> Well, did they ask personal stuff<br> about Amy?<br> You know, they asked...<br> Why didn't she have any friends?<br> What did you say?<br> - I said she was complicated.<br> - Nick!<br> Everyone knows "complicated"<br> is code for "bitch."<br> God. I feel sick.<br> Thanks.<br> It's so bizarre.<br> It seems like the kind of thing<br> that would happen to Amy.<br> She always attracts...<br> drama?<br> You can say it. It's just me and you.<br> Just because<br> I don't like to be around Amy...<br> Doesn't mean I don't care about her.<br> Anyway, whoever took her<br> is bound to bring her back.<br> Detective?

Come here.<br> Sit down.<br> Okay.<br> Did you, by any chance,<br> tell anybody anything about us?<br> Even in texting, or on Facebook.<br> Facebook? I use the disposable phone.<br> You buy my presents in cash.<br> I'm not stupid, Nick.<br> I know, sweetie.<br> Did you leave a pair of<br> red panties in my office?<br> I don't know. Maybe.<br> They better be mine.<br> Sweetheart, think.<br> I don't know.

I'm sorry.<br> I don't wanna fight.<br> I just wanna be with you.<br> Andie, please...<br> That's all I want.<br> I can't.<br> It's our last time together.<br> Let's make the most of it.<br> Real quick, but then you have to go.<br> My husband has come undone.<br> We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...<br> But as it turns out, we couldn't.<br> It means a lot that you came.<br> We took a hit on the brownstone...<br> And I used the last of my trust fund<br> to buy him a bar.<br> So far, it's just costing money.<br> Nick uses me for sex when he wants.<br> Otherwise, I don't exist.<br> We should go to outback tonight.<br> That would be nice.<br> Last night, I went from desperate<br> to pathetic.<br> I became someone I don't even like.<br> The kind of woman I used to mock.<br> You're out so much.<br> - I know.<br> - Stay home.<br> - I can't, I'm already late.<br> - Then, can I come?<br> You would hate it.<br> It's a bunch<br> of my dorky high school friends.<br> Do our code. No bullshit.<br> I thought<br> we weren't gonna be that couple.<br> Okay, bye.<br> - Hey, I've been thinking.<br> - Yeah?<br> Something positive.<br> Maybe it's time.<br> Now is literally the worst time.<br> It would be a new start for us.<br> And for me,<br> I would have a real purpose here.<br> A child is not a hobby.<br> Not a hobby.<br> An inspiration.<br> We could have had this fight<br> four hours ago. I'm late.<br> I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.<br> You really wanna be the couple<br> that has a baby to save their marriage?<br> "Save"?<br> Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!<br> - And you're gonna walk out the door now?<br> - Yeah!<br> You're a fucking coward.<br> No, it can't go on like this.<br> Really?<br> - I won't.<br> - You won't?<br> You won't?<br> Why, it's not good enough for you?<br> It's not even close!<br> You stupid bitch!<br> What scared me<br> wasn't that he'd pushed me.<br> What scared me was how much<br> he wanted to hurt me more.<br> What scared me<br> was that I'd finally realized...<br> I am frightened of my own husband.<br> You want me to call for backup?<br> Nah, I'll protect you.<br> Jesus.<br> They ought to burn this place down.<br> Seems like folks are trying.<br> You really think this is anything?<br> Cross it off the list.<br> Hey, Jason.<br> What's up, Rhonda?<br> "...and dedicated to the proposition<br> that all men..."<br> - Have you seen this girl around here?<br> - Why do you ask?<br> She was reported missing.<br> "...and so dedicated, can long endure."<br> Yeah. I remember her.<br> What did she want? Weed, pills?<br> She wanted a gun.<br> I told her it's not my thing.<br> I felt bad, though.<br> She seemed really desperate.<br> She said it needed to be small,<br> so she could keep it close.<br> Are you sure this is her?<br> You don't forget a girl like that<br> in here.<br> She was all in pink.<br> It was Valentine's day.<br> For Valentine's day,<br> I thought I'd buy a gun.<br> That is how crazy I've become.<br> Nick wants me gone<br> but he won't ask for a divorce.<br> In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,<br> his only line of credit.<br> The bitch with the prenup.<br> I could go home to my parents...<br> But I'd have to tell them the truth.<br> And I don't even know<br> if I believe the truth.<br> Can I really think Nick would hurt me?<br> I'm being paranoid. Crazy.<br> It's just...<br> I'd sleep better with a gun.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Wake up, baby.<br> My sister's gonna come out here.<br> - Sorry to rush you.<br> - It's okay.<br> - Here. Let me help you.<br> - Okay.<br> Just get that.<br> Be very careful.<br> I'm all right.<br> Here you go.<br> Promise me we'll talk every day.<br> Okay, we will.<br> Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.<br> Don't go crazy.<br> Okay.<br> You fucking idiot.<br> You fucking asshole!<br> You fucking lied to my fucking face!<br> I'm sorry.<br> How old is she?<br> She's in her early 20s.<br> How long?<br> - A year and a half.<br> - You lied to me for over a year?<br> If I told you,<br> you would have made me stop.<br> It's so fucking small.<br> You're a liar and a cheat!<br> You're just like dad!<br> How did you even meet her?<br> She's one of my students.<br> I thought writers hated clichs.<br> I'm not a writer.<br> "Boo-hoo, I got laid off.<br> I guess I'll fuck a teenager."<br> It wasn't like that, okay? You have<br> no idea how shitty it was with Amy...<br> How fucking terrible she made me feel.<br> Flyover boy.<br> I would get knots in my stomach...<br> Just coming home,<br> knowing she would be sitting there...<br> Dissatisfied, before I even<br> walked in the fucking door.<br> This is so bad.<br> If anybody finds out,<br> you're totally fucked.<br> Boney found a pair of panties<br> in my office...<br> Where, occasionally, Andie and I...<br> I don't know what the fuck it means.<br> Are they super-twat's?<br> Her name is Andie.<br> She's not entirely sure.<br> So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...<br> Who isn't sure<br> where she leaves her undies?<br> If they're not Andie's,<br> that means that they're Amy's...<br> And she left them there for me to find.<br> Nick, I was scared for you before,<br> and now, I'm fucking petrified.<br> We're having a vigil tonight<br> for your missing wife...<br> And this morning, you're kissing<br> your college girlfriend goodbye!<br> Can you imagine?<br> Have you watched television lately?<br> Cable news is all over your shit.<br> I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?<br> His wife's nowhere to be found...<br> And here's Nick dunne for you, flirting.<br> Cute pic, huh?<br> - Who is that?<br> - Some fucking tragedy groupie.<br> - Who the fuck is that?<br> - I don't know.<br> She was trying to give me a casserole.<br> On the show today<br> we have defense attorney, Tanner bolt...<br> Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.<br> Tanner bolt, would you actually consider<br> defending Nick dunne?<br> Well, let me just say...<br> As always, Ellen,<br> thank you for such a warm welcome.<br> But of course, I'd defend Nick dunne.<br> Listen, just because this guy<br> isn't walking around weeping...<br> That doesn't mean that he's not hurting.<br> Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath<br> is a lack of empathy.<br> But the truth is,<br> you'd have to be a sociopath...<br> To behave normally in this situation...<br> Because it's the most<br> abnormal situation in the world.<br> Tanner, are you trying to tell me<br> that this photo...<br> Is remotely in the realm<br> of acceptable behavior?<br> I'm so sick<br> of being picked apart by women.<br> You need to hire Tanner bolt.<br> I don't deserve this.<br> Innocent until proven guilty.<br> That's exactly what you deserve.<br> Go home, Nick.<br> Hey, buddy.<br> I can't believe<br> we haven't arrested this guy.<br> We're not gonna arrest anybody...<br> Just because some blonde dunce says so.<br> Why are you going so easy on him?<br> You got a crush?<br> One, I am conducting an investigation,<br> not a witch-hunt.<br> And, two,<br> don't talk to me that way, ever.<br> She was trying to buy a gun.<br> We don't know who<br> or what was scaring her, gil.<br> Give me the update.<br> No drug angles panned out yet,<br> so cross that off the list.<br> I talked to the nurses<br> who care for Nick's father.<br> The guy's a bastard,<br> but he's weak as<br> a kitten, so cross<br> that off the list.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> So, luminol lit up the kitchen<br> like the 4th of July.<br> - Whoa.<br> - Yeah.<br> The blood is profuse.<br> It is Amy's, type b,<br> and we should have DNA soon.<br> Thoughts on a weapon?<br> Trajectory indicates blunt force.<br> Maybe a club or a two-by-four.<br> She fell there,<br> but I doubt she got back up.<br> Amy's medical records come in?<br> No, we'll have them later tonight.<br> My wife says he's a killer.<br> Well, if Tiffany says...<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> Thank you all for coming out.<br> Hey Donnie, how are you?<br> Rich, thank you so much.<br> Hey.<br> Thank you, folks.<br> Thank you for being here tonight.<br> It just means the world to our family.<br> And to Amy.<br> As you all know...<br> My wife, Amy elliott dunne...<br> Disappeared three days ago.<br> And I want to implore anyone<br> who has any information at all...<br> Please come forward.

That was her idea.<br> She wanted me to.<br> You filed the paperwork.<br> Because she told me to!<br> Hold on a sec.<br> Yeah? Okay.<br> For sure?<br> All right.<br> She was pregnant.<br> This is insane.<br> So, my question becomes...<br> I don't want to talk<br> to you again, ever...<br> Without a lawyer.<br> Margo!<br> Hey.<br> Just hold on a second. Let me finish.<br> Nick?<br> I hear you, I hear you.<br> I was as surprised as...<br> I know you're upset.<br> I had no idea she was pregnant.<br> Listen, I thought so, too,<br> but evidently that wasn't...<br> you want to know the truth?<br> The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.<br> Well, I'm as surprised as...<br> you told me you didn't want kids.<br> I was trying to put a good face on.<br> Then, suddenly,<br> you've got a pregnant wife.<br> That's a problem for you.<br> Especially when you factor in<br> the secret teenage girlfriend.<br> Oh, stop watching Ellen abbott!<br> You have to fucking talk to me!<br> I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids<br> because she didn't want me to.<br> Because it would have just been<br> another reason for you to hate her.<br> And we had enough of those already!<br> It was easier to just...<br> - lie to me?<br> - I wanted kids!<br> When we first moved here,<br> I went to a fertility clinic!<br> - It didn't work?<br> - I did my part!<br> Masturbate.<br> When it came time for Amy to do her thing,<br> all of a sudden it was like...<br> "Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."<br> Now, who would believe you?<br> All right.<br> This is a letter from the clinic...<br> Notifying me<br> that they're gonna destroy my sample...<br> Unless I contact them.<br> So, I gave it to Amy.<br> The next day, I saw it in the trash.<br> But you were already with Andie<br> by then, right?<br> I wanted a baby with Amy.<br> A year ago, Amy being pregnant<br> would have been the best thing ever!<br> "When your poor Amy has a cold,<br> this dessert just..."<br> this is the clue you couldn't solve.<br> Yeah.<br> A letter from desi.<br> That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?<br> It was the fucking rich guy<br> who would do anything for her.<br> It just kept hanging over my head.<br> It was disgusting.<br> Your prenup?<br> Nick, why have you kept this stuff?<br> It's like a little box of hate.<br> I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!<br> I love you no matter what.<br> But you need to tell me.<br> Tell you what?<br> What are you asking me?<br> Are you asking me<br> if I killed my wife, go?<br> Is that what you're asking me?<br> If I murdered my wife?<br> I would never ask you that!<br> Margo!<br> Don't walk on the glass.<br> You have no clue, do you?<br> Why was he here that night?<br> His wife is missing. Why come here?<br> Who cares?<br> Rhonda, we got this.<br> Let's make the arrest.<br> Do you know how hard it is<br> to make a murder case without a body?<br> No.<br> Well, it's incredibly hard.<br> So, I want one last thing.<br> What's that?<br> I want a body.<br> Picture me.<br> I'm a girl who's very, very bad.<br> Be careful.<br> I need to be punished,<br> and by "punished," I mean "had."<br> Fuck.<br> It's where you keep goodies<br> for anniversary five.<br> So, open the door...<br> Punish.

Bleed and clean.<br> And leave a little something behind.<br> A fire in July?<br> And because you're you...<br> You don't stop there.<br> You need a diary.<br> Minimum, 300 entries<br> on the Nick and Amy story.<br> Start with the fairy tale early days.<br> Those are true. And they're crucial.<br> You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.<br> After that, you invent.<br> The spending.<br> The abuse. The fear.<br> The threat of violence.<br> And Nick thought he was the writer.<br> Burn it just the right amount.<br> Make sure the cops will find it.<br> Finally, honor tradition<br> with a very special treasure hunt.<br> And if I get everything right,<br> the world will hate Nick...<br> For killing his beautiful,<br> pregnant wife.<br> And after all the outrage,<br> when I'm ready...<br> I'll go out on the water<br> with a handful of pills...<br> And a pocket full of stones.<br> And when they find my body,<br> they'll know...<br> Nick dunne dumped his beloved<br> like garbage.<br> And she floated down<br> past all the other...<br> Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.<br> Then, Nick will die, too.<br> Nick and Amy will be gone.<br> But, then, we never really existed.<br> Nick loved a girl<br> I was pretending to be.<br> "Cool girl."<br> Men always use that<br> as their defining compliment.<br> "She's a cool girl."<br> Cool girl is hot.<br> Cool girl is game.<br> Cool girl is fun.<br> Cool girl never gets angry at her man.<br> She only smiles in a chagrined,<br> loving manner...<br> And then presents her mouth for fucking.<br> She likes what he likes.<br> So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster<br> who loves fetish manga.<br> If he likes girls gone wild,<br> she's a mall babe...<br> Who talks football<br> and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.<br> When I met Nick dunne,<br> I knew he wanted cool girl.<br> And for him, I'll admit,<br> I was willing to try.<br> I wax-stripped my pussy raw.<br> I drank canned beer<br> watching Adam sandler movies.<br> I ate cold pizza<br> and remained a size two.<br> I blew him semi-regularly.<br> I lived in the moment.<br> I was fucking game.<br> I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.<br> Nick teased out of me<br> things I didn't know existed.<br> A lightness, a humor, an ease.<br> But I made him smarter. Sharper.<br> I inspired him to rise to my level.<br> I forged the man of my dreams.<br> We were happy pretending<br> to be other people.<br> We were the happiest couple we knew.<br> And what's the point of being together<br> if you're not the happiest?<br> But Nick got lazy.<br> He became someone<br> I did not agree to marry.<br> He actually expected me<br> to love him unconditionally.<br> Then he dragged me, penniless,<br> to the navel of this great country...<br> And found himself a newer,<br> younger, bouncier...<br> Cool girl.<br> You think I'd let him destroy me<br> and end up happier than ever?<br> No fucking way.<br> He doesn't get to win.<br> My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,<br> Missouri guy.<br> He needed to learn.<br> Grown-ups work for things.<br> Grown-ups pay.<br> Grown-ups suffer consequences.<br> Wait.<br> I need 20 seconds where you<br> don't judge me, interrupt me...<br> Or get angry.<br> Okay.<br> Is that all the stuff<br> from the credit cards?<br> Where do you store goodies<br> for anniversary five?<br> Wood.<br> - Woodshed.<br> - Yeah, my woodshed.<br> That fucking bitch.<br> - I thought...<br> - It's all right.<br> I would have, too.<br> What's that present?<br> I don't know.<br> Let's find out.<br> "Dear husband, I know you think<br> you're moving through this world unseen.<br> "Don't believe that for a second.<br> "I know where you've been,<br> and I know where you're going."<br> "For this anniversary,<br> I've arranged a trip.<br> "Follow the river, up, up, up.<br> "Sit back and relax,<br> because you are done."<br> What's "up, up river"?<br> "Up the river."

Come on in.<br> First thing you<br> have to understand<br> about Amy, she loves<br> to teach lessons.<br> - Play God.<br> - Yeah, old testament God.<br> Okay. Keep talking.<br> She finds out I've been cheating on her<br> with Andie...<br> Decides to teach me a lesson.<br> Fakes her own death, frames me for it.<br> Blood in the house, credit cards,<br> life insurance.<br> She does the treasure hunt.<br> Now, the treasure hunt is critical.<br> She's taking us on a<br> tour of my infidelities.<br> Rubbing my nose in it.<br> And she leaves clue number one<br> for the police...<br> Which will lead them<br> back to my office...<br> Which is a place<br> where Andie and I would often...<br> And she leaves a pair of red panties.<br> Right. Racy, looks bad.<br> - Clue two.<br> - My father's house.<br> Another place where Andie and I<br> would occasionally have relations.<br> - Clue three?<br> - Woodshed.<br> - Also a location...<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - We had limited options.<br> - A hotel.<br> - Amy would have seen the credit card bill.<br> - Put it on Andie's credit card.<br> Andie's statement<br> went right to her parents.<br> Nick, margo, can we head over<br> to the little brown house?<br> - This leads us to what?<br> - My dad's house.<br> Dad's house is blue.<br> After the divorce,<br> when dad wasn't coming around...<br> I used to pretend that he was a spy<br> named Mr. brown, who...<br> For the sake of his children's safety,<br> had to deny their existence.<br> You never told me that.<br> You told her that?<br> We've got incriminating red panties<br> in your office.<br> We've got a showcase showdown<br> worth of crap in your woodshed.<br> So, what in God's name<br> is at your father's house, Nick?<br> And be honest.<br> I honestly have no idea.<br> Whatever they<br> found, I think it's<br> safe to assume that<br> it's very bad.<br> We got a lot of uncontained issues here.<br> Nick, do you have any idea<br> as to what Andie's mindset is?<br> We haven't communicated since the vigil.<br> Okay. Amy's parents?<br> - No, it's...<br> - More pressure.<br> We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will<br> no doubt go public at any moment.<br> - No, Andie won't do that.<br> - She will.<br> They always do.<br> Don't take it personally.<br> Amy's got us in an interesting bind.<br> - We need to tell the cops about Andie.<br> - Really?<br> Right now,<br> Andie just gives you another motive.<br> We need to tell the cops<br> about the woodshed.<br> We need to be on the front end of that.<br> But I'm gonna warn you<br> as to what will happen.<br> They'll go after margo.<br> They can't do that, can they?<br> She's your accomplice.<br> She helped you hide the evidence.<br> In all likelihood,<br> she knows that you killed Amy.<br> God.<br> Well, what are we going to do?<br> We find Amy.<br> No. Any other strategy<br> is missing the point.<br> I've got two ex-secret service guys<br> that are really good.<br> I'll put them on it.<br> But where do they start, Nick?<br> Where would Amy go?<br> I have no idea.<br> Are we keeping score?<br> Hey!<br> I thought we were steering clear<br> of men for a while.<br> He's nice.<br> Because he wants to fuck you.<br> She's still moping about her ex?<br> He got cheated on, too.<br> We three are the<br> saddest sacks in all the ozarks.<br> I'm not sad.<br> I'm angry.<br> There you go.<br> I almost drank myself to death<br> when my wife left me.<br> I was gonna kill myself.<br> Can you believe that?<br> Don't give him the pleasure.<br> I was going to drown myself<br> in the Gulf of Mexico...<br> Let myself be dinner<br> for the great whites.<br> Gulf is bull sharks, miss nawlins.<br> Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.<br> Please put that on a t-shirt.<br> Miss moneybags.<br> I thought you said you were broke.<br> That's a fat wad.<br> It's mostly singles.<br> Singles?

No.<br> At a certain point,<br> we got on the wrong track.<br> I had a moment of weakness.<br> Your "moment" was over 15 months.<br> I disrespected my wife.<br> And I disrespected my marriage.<br> And I'll always regret it.<br> That works.<br> Don't be afraid to play up<br> the dufus husband thing, Nick.<br> "I was an idiot.

Five... four...<br> Three... two...<br> Seriously, I can't believe<br> how fucking good you were.<br> - Amy brings out the best in me.<br> - Don't.<br> Keep it together, you two.<br> At least for the next 24 hours.<br> People still hate you.<br> Women want to scratch your eyes out.<br> Andie was really good TV.<br> - She's a good person.<br> - Therein lies the problem.<br> Ride this out...<br> And when Sharon airs tomorrow,<br> we'll be looking at a whole new you.<br> But, until then...<br> Don't show your face.<br> No problem.<br> Welcome.<br> Make yourself at home.<br> I've got music, satellite...<br> Netflix.<br> He was her teacher!<br> Roku.<br> Internet, obviously.<br> Here is a supposedly grown man...<br> if there is ever anything you have<br> a taste for and you can't find it...<br> Just let me know<br> and I will get it for you.<br> Instead of the a-b-c's,<br> he taught her the birds and the bees.<br> And just think how her mother must feel<br> at a time like this.<br> Wine cellar's downstairs.<br> I'll get you some clothes, too.<br> Not that I don't appreciate<br> bait shop chic.<br> The floors are heated,<br> just dial to your liking.<br> There's robes and towels.<br> The shower has steam.<br> The bathtub has a massage cycle.<br> There's a great view,<br> if you're in the mood.<br> Blackout curtains if you're not.<br> The bed is savoir.<br> You'll never get a better sleep.<br> This is just what I need.<br> I'm so exhausted.<br> I'll leave you to it, then.<br> Amy, I am so happy that you are here.<br> And I don't want you to worry<br> for one moment.<br> There are cameras everywhere.<br> The exterior, all along the grounds,<br> the entryway.<br> Anyone...<br> Who is caught coming or going...<br> Will be recorded.<br> You are more than safe.<br> And I am not letting you get away again.<br> - Good morning!<br> - Don't do that!<br> I'm sorry.<br> I need to feel safe.<br> You are very safe.<br> - What have you been up to?<br> - Nothing.<br> Amy, I'm not Nick.<br> It's hard for me.<br> After so many years<br> under someone's thumb...<br> I know just what that feels like.<br> You were never under my thumb.<br> - On your leash.<br> - Never.<br> A new start.<br> Decent clothes.<br> Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.<br> There's a gym overlooking the lake.<br> The sooner you look like yourself,<br> the sooner you'll feel like yourself.<br> I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch<br> Sharon schieber, and finally move on.<br> I think that's something<br> I should watch on my own.<br> Nonsense.<br> I'll be back.<br> And I am looking forward...<br> To my reunion with Amy elliott.<br> Great.<br> Good evening, I'm Sharon schieber.<br> - Tonight, exclusively...<br> - Hurry up.<br> A husband breaks his silence,<br> not just on his wife's disappearance...<br> But on his infidelity,<br> and all those shocking rumors.<br> Nick dunne...<br> You're probably the most hated man<br> in America right now.<br> I probably am.<br> And I probably deserve it.<br> I bought that tie.<br> Did you kill your wife, Nick?<br> I did not kill my wife.<br> I am not a murderer.<br> But you were unfaithful.<br> I was unfaithful.<br> And I am deeply ashamed.<br> And, on top of that,<br> you allowed Amy's parents...<br> Her friends,<br> all the people in your hometown...<br> Believe you were a loving husband,<br> desperate to find his missing wife.<br> Well, I am desperate<br> to find my missing wife.<br> You say that, but I'm wondering<br> how you expect us to believe you...<br> Now that we know you're a liar.<br> I didn't come forward with my affair...<br> Because I knew it would make me look<br> really, really bad.<br> But I don't care about that anymore.<br> I just want to find my wife.<br> - I'm just trying to get clear...<br> - Let me be clear.<br> Just because I am not a murderer<br> doesn't make me a good guy.<br> I'm not a good guy.<br> I was a bad husband to a great wife.<br> I broke the vow that I made to her.<br> Those are pretty words, Nick.<br> But what does that really mean to you?<br> It basically means<br> that I was a con artist.<br> I met Amy elliott seven years ago.<br> I was completely transfixed.<br> Amy can do that to you.<br> I was this average guy<br> from an average place...<br> With mediocre aspirations.<br> And I met a woman who dazzled me.<br> And I wanted her to love me...<br> So I pretended to be better than I was.<br> When we got married,<br> I promised to be that guy.<br> That guy who works harder.<br> That guy who, who lives and acts...<br> And loves with as much passion<br> as she does.<br> But I failed her.<br> Instead of doing what was right...<br> I did what was easy.<br> You talk like a man who believes<br> he can make amends to his wife.<br> Who believes his wife is still alive.<br> She is still alive.<br> Will you look at that camera for me?<br> Will you look in the lens...<br> And talk to your wife?<br> If she is out there,<br> able to hear and see you tonight...<br> What would you like to say to her, Nick?<br> Amy, I love you.<br> You're the best person I've ever known.<br> And I've taken myself to the woodshed<br> for the way that I've treated you.<br> And if you come back, I promise...<br> I will spend every day<br> making it up to you.<br> I will be the man<br> that I promised you I would be.<br> I love you.<br> Come home.<br> Here.<br> Regardless of what you thought...<br> What does it say?<br> I think we can all agree...<br> Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.<br> There's more to him<br> than meets the eye.<br> They're going crazy for you.<br> They disliked me, they liked me,<br> they hated me.<br> And now they love me.<br> A candor and an honesty<br> that's worthy of respect.<br> He's certainly earned mine.<br> What is it?<br> I'm Sharon schieber. Good night.<br> Margo dunne, this is a search warrant<br> for your property.<br> I usually ignore tipline calls...<br> But a neighbor was concerned about<br> a strange man around your woodshed.<br> Call Tanner.<br> Okay. Fuck!<br> Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.<br> Is that what this is about?<br> I have treated you more than fair<br> throughout this entire investigation.<br> I gave you the benefit of the doubt<br> over and over.<br> Every time you said something stupid...<br> I thought, "maybe he's just stupid."<br> But I was wrong.<br> That's what this is about.<br> Are these the clubs<br> you don't play golf with?<br> None of that is mine.<br> None of this was put here by me.<br> Those are nice clubs.<br> You got the makings of a real man cave.<br> Everything just waiting<br> until the wife goes away for good.<br> Nick!<br> - You can't do that!<br> - Of course we can.<br> Amy, it's time to move on.<br> What can I do to help?<br> I need some time to think.<br> - That's the last thing you need.<br> - Desi...<br> twenty years,<br> you have kept me dangling.<br> Finally, last night, you came to me,<br> and you chose me.<br> Follow that instinct.<br> Don't trust the instinct<br> that left you beaten and homeless...<br> Sleeping in your car,<br> fearing for your life.<br> I'm not gonna force myself on you.<br> I understand what you're saying, desi.<br> I do.<br> I've been so mistreated for so long.<br> I've forgotten how to behave.<br> I'll move in here tomorrow...<br> And we'll work it out together.<br> I just want you to be you again.<br> They only took margo to fuck with you.<br> She's not spending<br> another fucking second in there.<br> I'm gonna go in,<br> and I'm gonna tell them everything.<br> What?<br> We tell boney very little.<br> Without a body,<br> without a murder weapon...<br> Their only hope is a confession.<br> So, you let them do all the talking.<br> That way,<br> we can jump-start your defense.<br> The truth is my defense.<br> Recognize these?<br> Yes.<br> It's Amy's anniversary present to me.<br> Was that how she told you<br> she was pregnant, Nick?<br> Mommy, daddy, baby,<br> and that made you real mad?<br> No.<br> - Recognize this?<br> - Never seen that before in my life.<br> It's Amy's diary.<br> We found this at your father's house.<br> Is this your wife's handwriting?<br> - He's not a handwriting ex...<br> - Looks like it.<br> Our experts thought so, too.<br> Do you wanna<br> play a little true or false?<br> Sure.<br> "And then he brushes the sugar off my lips<br> so he can taste me."<br> Yeah, that's true.<br> You thought quinoa was a fish?<br> That is also true, yes.<br> She wanted to get pregnant,<br> you assaulted her.<br> I hit her? No, never happened.<br> - "Pushed," it says "pushed."<br> - Absolutely not.<br> I never touched her.<br> She tried to buy a gun.<br> I doubt that, but I don't know.<br> Shall I read the last entry?<br> Sure.<br> "This man may kill me."<br> In her own words,<br> "this man may kill me."<br> It's kind of a convenient end note.<br> For future reference...<br> The truth,<br> you are not a handwriting expert.<br> Okay, I know.<br> Judy's missing handle.<br> Big as a two-by-four, right?<br> Big as a club.<br> We found this day one,<br> in the fireplace in your home office.<br> We didn't know what the hell it was,<br> but fire in July?<br> We bagged it.<br> I've never seen that before either.<br> We just tested it.<br> Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.<br> So, finally, Nicholas dunne...<br> You're under arrest<br> for the murder of your wife.<br> Do not say another word.<br> - What about my side?<br> - Nick!<br> More coffee?<br> I'd love it.<br> Remember that time we skipped school<br> and drove to the cape?<br> God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.<br> This reminds me of that.<br> Never-ending holiday.<br> You're not bored?<br> Desi, how could I be bored?<br> You can discuss<br> quote proust in French.<br> Nick's idea of culture<br> was a reality TV marathon...<br> With one hand down his boxers.<br> I really have to get going.<br> But I will be back<br> just as soon as I can.<br> My keys.<br> Thank you.<br> That's how the kids wear it.<br> Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.<br> Hey.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yes. Are you?<br> Yeah.<br> Let's go.<br> What does this mean?<br> Well, you're out on bond.<br> You can relax at home<br> while we prep for trial.<br> Keep your head down.<br> Tanner, is there<br> any fucking lead on Amy?<br> I've got two of my best guys on it.<br> She's air.<br> Come home, Amy. I dare you.<br> Mr. collings is home.<br> Hello, Mr. collings.<br> I've missed you.<br> I've been thinking...<br> I don't wanna be without you.<br> Stay with me.<br> And when all this dies down,<br> we'll go to Greece, like you said.<br> Octopus and scrabble?<br> How long do you think until it's done?<br> Not long. Six months for the trial.<br> Sentencing will be quick.<br> He'll appeal.<br> I can watch the rest overseas.<br> Go slowly.<br> But I want it.<br> Don't rush.<br> Just do it.<br> Harder.<br> You fucking bitch.<br> Don't you worry,<br> you're gonna have lots of babies.<br> Her wounds are consistent with rape.<br> There was semen present.<br> We'll make sure it's a match.<br> Yeah, it'll match.<br> Thank you very much.<br> What do you think?<br> Are we pals again?<br> Now that I know<br> you didn't murder your wife, yes.<br> What do you think?<br> Kidnapping? The story's insane.<br> She's on fairly heavy painkillers.<br> It's okay. I want to help.<br> Ms. dunne, I know<br> what you've been through...<br> So we'll keep this very brief.<br> Can you walk us through what happened?<br> That morning, the doorbell rang.<br> So normal.<br> I opened the door.<br> So strange.<br> Since high school,<br> he won't ever go away.<br> And I've just tried to be nice to him.<br> Answer his letters.<br> Keep him calm.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I've encouraged him.<br> You can't blame yourself.<br> He pushed inside.<br> And he grabbed me.<br> But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.<br> And he clubbed me.<br> I collapsed.<br> That club was actually the handle<br> to a punch and Judy puppet.<br> Right.<br> Treasure hunt.<br> I'd hidden some puppets at go's...<br> then how did desi have that handle?<br> I'd just found it.<br> It must have fallen off.<br> I was holding it when desi pushed in.<br> So, he got it from me.<br> About that woodshed...<br> He took me to his lake house.<br> Tied me to his bed.<br> Back to the woodshed real quick.<br> Real quick.<br> When you went<br> to place the puppets there...<br> Did you notice that it was packed...<br> lots of stuff.<br> Corresponding to purchases made<br> on credit cards in your husband's name.<br> Nick and credit cards.<br> He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.<br> He hid a lot of stuff at go's.<br> They're very close.<br> Now, may I go back<br> to where I was being held prisoner...<br> By a man with a history<br> of mental problems?<br> Please continue, Ms. dunne.<br> Desi assaulted me that night.<br> Every night.<br> He tied me up like a dog.<br> And then, he'd punish me.<br> Starve me.<br> Shave me.<br> Sodomize me.<br> There were cameras everywhere.<br> Please find this. Please find the tapes.<br> She slit his throat with a box cutter.<br> How did she manage<br> to get a hold of a box cutter...<br> If he had her tied up the whole time?<br> Can't you just be happy<br> your wife is home and safe?<br> Amy, we found your diary.<br> It contains many concerning allegations<br> of mental and physical abuse.<br> Well, it's the ugly truth.<br> Nick didn't want a baby.<br> He has a temper. We had money problems.<br> But I love him.<br> Then why did you try to buy a gun?<br> I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.<br> If I could just clarify one thing...<br> if this case had been left<br> in your deeply incompetent hands...<br> My husband would be on death row...<br> And I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...<br> Ms. dunne, you've been very brave.<br> We're finished.<br> Now, I have to ask you...<br> Do you feel safe<br> going home with your husband?<br> We prayed to God,<br> and God has answered our prayers.<br> Amy dunne is home.<br> Now, I know there are<br> a lot of questions and concerns...<br> But for right now, we wanna sit tight...<br> And just be thankful and grateful<br> for this miracle on the Mississippi.<br> Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.<br> We love you, Amy!<br> All right, you can stop pretending now.<br> I'm not pretending.<br> You were perfect.<br> The Nick I saw on TV,<br> that's the Nick I fell in love with.<br> You do know I was just telling you<br> what you wanted to hear, right?<br> That's how well you know me.<br> You know me in your marrow.<br> Okay.<br> You need to tell me<br> exactly what happened.<br> Take off your clothes.<br> I need to make sure<br> you're not wearing a wire.<br> You killed someone, Amy.<br> You're a murderer.<br> I'm a fighter.<br> I fought my way back to you.<br> You killed a guy.<br> You slashed his throat<br> with a box cutter.<br> You went on national television<br> and begged for me to save your life.<br> And I obliged.<br> But I want that Nick.<br> I'm leaving.<br> You really think that's smart?<br> Shampoo.<br> Wounded, raped wife battles her way<br> back to her husband...<br> And he deserts her.<br> They'll destroy you.<br> Neighbors will shun you.<br> And I'll make sure that no one forgets<br> the pain you caused me.<br> I don't want anything to do<br> with your groupies outside.<br> Once they go...<br> I go.<br> Give it the night. Sleep on it.<br> Was there ever a baby?<br> There can be.<br> Good night.<br> Hey, Nick!<br> Hello, handsome.<br> Crepe?<br> Sure.<br> She was his dream girl.<br> And when this spoiled, rich,<br> entitled little boy couldn't have her...<br> He took her.<br> You must be so proud.<br> It's been four hours.<br> Nick?
