Ain't no need<br> of havin' it come right back up again.<br> Why does a girl have to be so silly<br> to catch a husband?<br> Scarlett, ifyou're not here by the time<br> I count ten, we'll be goin' without you!<br> I'm coming, Pa!<br> One...<br> ...two, three...<br> ...four, five, six....<br> Oh, dear!<br> My stays are so tight I know I'll never get<br> through the day without belching.<br> Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br> you'll be having for the barbecue.<br> So it seems, Gerald.<br> But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?<br> She's after settling accounts<br> with the overseer.<br> But she'll be along for the ball tonight.<br> Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.<br> Thank you kindly, lndia.<br> Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br> John.<br> India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br> We must greet them.<br> I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw<br> the way she throws herself at Ashley.<br> Now, that's your brother's business.<br> You must remember your duties<br> as hostess.<br> Good morning, girls.<br> Good morning, Scarlett.<br> Why, lndia Wilkes, what a lovely dress!<br> -Perfectly lovely, darling.<br> -I just can't take my eyes off it.<br> Scarlett, honey....<br> You're looking mighty fine this morning.<br> -Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br> -Good morning.<br> -It's a pleasure to see you.<br> -Good morning.<br> Howdy, Miss Scarlett.<br> Ashley!<br> Scarlett, my dear.<br> I've been looking for you everywhere.<br> I've got something I must tell you.<br> -Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br> -Yes, I'd like to, but l...<br> ...l have something to tell you too.<br> Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.<br> But come say hello<br> to my cousin, Melanie, first.<br> Oh, do we have to?<br> She's been looking forward<br> to seeing you again.<br> Melanie!<br> Here's Scarlett.<br> Scarlett!<br> I'm so glad to see you again.<br> Melanie Hamilton!<br> What a surprise to run into you here.<br> I hope you'll stay with us<br> a few days at least.<br> I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br> to become real friends, Scarlett.<br> I do so want us to be.<br> We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?<br> We'll just have to make the biggest fuss<br> over her, won't we?<br> If there's anybody knows how to give a girl<br> a good time, it's Ashley.<br> Though I expect our good times will seem<br> silly to you because you're so serious.<br> Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.<br> I've always admired you so.<br> I wish I could be more like you.<br> You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br> and say things you don't mean.<br> Nobody could accuse Melanie<br> of being insincere. Could they, my dear?<br> Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?<br> Ashley never means a word he says<br> to any girl.<br> Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br> you handsome old thing, you!<br> But, oh, Miss O'Hara, l....<br> Was it kind to bring<br> your good-looking brother here...<br> ...just to break my poor, simple,<br> country-girl's heart?<br> She never even noticed Charles before.<br> Because he's your beau,<br> she's after him like a hornet.<br> Charles Hamilton,<br> I want to eat barbecue with you.<br> Mind you, don't go philandering with<br> any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.<br> I won't, Miss O'Hara!<br> I couldn't!<br> I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br> if you don't look dashing...<br> ...with that new set of whiskers!<br> Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.<br> Charles and Rafe asked me<br> to eat barbecue with them...<br> ...but I told them I couldn't<br> because I promised you.<br> You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br> She's after your beau now!<br> Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br> Miss Scarlett.<br> I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.<br> What's your sister so mad about?<br> You sparkin' her beau?<br> As if I couldn't get a better beau<br> than that old maid in britches.<br> Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br> old things, you! No, you're not!<br> I won't say that. I'm mad at you!<br> What have we done?<br> You haven't been near me all day.<br> I wore this old dress...<br> ...'cause I thought you liked it.<br> I was counting on eating barbecue<br> with you two.<br> -Well, you are, Scarlett.<br> -Of course, you are.<br> Oh, I never can make up my mind<br> which of you two is the handsomer.<br> I was awake all last night trying<br> to figure it out.<br> Cathleen, who's that?<br> Who?<br> That man looking at us and smiling.<br> The nasty, dark one.<br> My dear, don't you know?<br> That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.<br> He has the most terrible reputation.<br> He looks as if, as if he knows<br> what I look like without my shimmy!<br> Scarlett!<br> Why, my dear, he isn't received!<br> He spends a lot of time up North...<br> ...because his folks in Charleston<br> won't even speak to him.<br> He was expelled from West Point,<br> he's so fast.<br> And then there's that business<br> about that girl he wouldn't marry.<br> Tell, tell!<br> Well, he took her out buggy riding<br> in the late afternoon without a chaperon!<br> And then he refused to marry her!<br> No, but she was ruined just the same.<br> Ashley!<br> Happy?<br> So happy!<br> You seem to belong here...<br> ...as if it had all been imagined for you.<br> I like to feel that I belong<br> to the things you love.<br> You love Twelve Oaks as I do.<br> Yes, Ashley.<br> I love it as...<br> ...as more than a house.<br> It's a whole world that wants only<br> to be graceful and beautiful.<br> It's so unaware that it may not last...<br> ...forever.<br> You're afraid of what may happen<br> if the war comes, aren't you?<br> But we don't have to be afraid for us.<br> No war can come into our world, Ashley.<br> Whatever comes...<br> ...l'll love you, just as I do now...<br> ...until I die.<br> Isn't this better than sitting at a table?<br> A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br> at a table.<br> I'll go get her dessert.<br> -Here, she said me.<br> -Allow me, Miss O'Hara.<br> I think....<br> I think Charles Hamilton may get it.<br> Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!<br> Thank you.<br> Go get it.<br> Isn't he the luckiest...?<br> Miss O'Hara...<br> ...l love you.<br> I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.<br> Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.<br> Well-brought-up young ladies<br> take naps at parties.<br> And it's high time you started behavin' and<br> actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.<br> When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br> any Yankee girls taking naps.<br> No, and you ain't gonna see<br> no Yankee girls at the ball tonight neither.<br> How was Ashley today, Scarlett?<br> He didn't seem to be paying<br> much attention to you.<br> You mind your own business!<br> You'll be lucky not to lose<br> ol' whisker-face Kennedy.<br> You've liked Ashley for months!<br> His engagement's gonna be announced<br> tonight. Pa said so this morning.<br> That's all you know.<br> Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br> You all behave yourselves.<br> Actin' like poor, white-trash children!<br> If you's old enough to go to parties,<br> you's old enough to act like ladies.<br> Who cares!<br> We've borne enough insults<br> from the meddling Yankees.<br> It's time we made them understand<br> we'll keep our slaves...<br> ...with or without their approval.<br> 'Twas the sovereign right of the<br> state of Georgia to secede from the Union!<br> That's right!<br> The South must assert herself<br> by force of arms.<br> After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br> at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!<br> -There's no other way!<br> -Fight! That's right. Fight!<br> Let the Yankees ask for peace!<br> The situation is very simple.<br> The Yankees can't fight and we can.<br> There won't even be a battle.<br> They'll just turn and run every time.<br> One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.<br> We'll finish them in one battle.<br> Gentlemen can always fight better<br> than rabble.<br> Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br> than rabble.<br> What does the captain of our troop say?<br> Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights<br> I go with her.<br> But, like my father, I hope that the Yankees<br> will let us leave the Union in peace.<br> -But, Ashley....<br> -But, Ashley, they've insulted us!<br> You can't mean you don't want war!<br> Most of the miseries of the world<br> were caused by wars.<br> And when the wars were over<br> no one ever knew what they were about.<br> If it wasn't that I knew you--<br> Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br> up North, I hear.<br> Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?<br> I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br> gentlemen.<br> What do you mean, sir?<br> There's not a cannon factory<br> in the whole South.<br> What difference does that make<br> to a gentleman?<br> It'll make a great deal of difference<br> to a great many gentlemen, sir.<br> Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br> that the Yankees can lick us?<br> No, I'm not hinting.<br> I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br> are better equipped than we.<br> They've got factories, shipyards,<br> coal mines...<br> ...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br> and starve us to death.<br> All we've got is cotton and slaves<br> and arrogance.<br> -That's Yankee treachery!<br> -Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!<br> I'm sorry if the truth offends you.<br> Apologies aren't enough, sir!<br> I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br> Mr. Rhett Butler...<br> ...and you aren't received by any decent<br> family in Charleston, not even your own!<br> I apologize again for all my shortcomings.<br> Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br> and look over your place.<br> I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy<br> and cigars and...<br> ...dreams of victory.<br> That'sjust about what you could expect<br> from somebody like Rhett Butler.<br> You did everything but call him out.<br> He refused to fight.<br> Not quite that, Charles.<br> He refused to take advantage of you.<br> Take advantage of me?<br> He's one of the best shots in the country...<br> ...as he's proved a number of times...<br> ...against steadier hands and cooler heads<br> than yours.<br> -I'll show him!<br> -Now, please.<br> Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.<br> You may be needed<br> for more important fighting, Charles.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me,<br> Mr. Butler is our guest.<br> I think I'll just show him around.<br> Ashley!<br> Ashley!<br> Scarlett.<br> Who're you hiding from in here?<br> What are you up to?<br> Well, why aren't you upstairs resting<br> with the other girls?<br> What is this, Scarlett? A secret?<br> Oh, Ashley, Ashley...<br> ...l love you.<br> Scarlett!<br> I love you, I do!<br> Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br> every other man's heart today?<br> You've always had mine.<br> You cut your teeth on it.<br> Oh, don't tease me now.<br> Have I your heart, my darling?<br> I love you, I love you.<br> You mustn't say such things.<br> You'll hate me for hearing them.<br> Oh, I could never hate you,<br> and I know you must care about me.<br> Oh, you do care, don't you?<br> Yes...<br> ...l care.<br> Oh, can't we go away and forget<br> we ever said these things?<br> But how can we do that?<br> Don't you want to marry me?<br> I'm going to marry Melanie.<br> But you can't. Not if you care for me.<br> Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br> say things that will hurt you?<br> How can I make you understand?<br> You're so young and unthinking.<br> You don't know what marriage means.<br> I know I love you,<br> and I want to be your wife.<br> You don't love Melanie.<br> She's like me, Scarlett.<br> She's part of my blood<br> and we understand each other.<br> But you love me.<br> How could I help loving you?<br> You have all the passion for life that I lack.<br> That kind of love isn't enough<br> for a successful marriage...<br> ...for two people as different as we are.<br> Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br> You're afraid to marry me.<br> You'd rather live with that fool<br> who can't speak except...<br> ...to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br> of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.<br> You mustn't say such things<br> about Melanie.<br> Who are you to tell me I mustn't?<br> You led me on, you made me believe<br> you wanted to marry me.<br> Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br> I never, at any time--<br> You did, it's true you did!<br> I'll hate you till I die!<br> I can't think of anything bad enough<br> to call you.<br> Has the war started?<br> Sir, you should have made<br> your presence known.<br> In the middle of that beautiful love scene?<br> That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br> would it?<br> But don't worry,<br> your secret is safe with me.<br> Sir, you are no gentleman!<br> And you, Miss, are no lady.<br> Don't think I hold that against you.<br> Ladies have never held any charm for me.<br> First you take a low, common advantage<br> of me, then you insult me.<br> I meant it as a compliment<br> and I hope to see more of you...<br> ...when you're free of the spell<br> of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.<br> He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br> for a girl of your, what was it?<br> Your "passion for living."<br> How dare you!<br> You aren't fit to wipe his boots.<br> And you were going to hate him<br> for the rest of your life.<br> She certainly made a fool of herself<br> running after all the men at the barbecue.<br> That's not fair, lndia.<br> She's so attractive,<br> the menjust naturally flock to her.<br> Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br> to be true.<br> Didn't you see her going after<br> your brother, Charles?<br> Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.<br> Oh, you're wrong, lndia.<br> Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.<br> Men may flirt with girls like that<br> but they don't marry them.<br> I think you're being very mean to her.<br> War! War's declared! War!<br> Miss O'Hara!<br> Miss O'Hara!<br> Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br> volunteers to fight against us.<br> Don't you men ever think<br> of anything important?<br> But it's war and everybody's going off<br> to enlist.<br> They're going right away. I'm going too.<br> Everybody?<br> Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?<br> To see us go, I mean.<br> I'll cry into my pillow every night.<br> Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.<br> You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br> and the sweetest and the dearest.<br> I know I couldn't hope<br> that you could love me.<br> I'm so clumsy and stupid<br> and not nearly good enough for you.<br> But if you could think of marrying me<br> I'd do anything in the world for you.<br> Just anything. I promise.<br> What did you say?<br> Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?<br> Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.<br> You will? You'll marry me.<br> You'll wait for me?<br> I don't think I'd want to wait.<br> You mean you'll marry me before I go?<br> Oh, Miss O'Hara.<br> Scarlett....<br> When may I speak to your father?<br> The sooner the better.<br> I'll go now. I can't wait.<br> Will you excuse me, dear?<br> Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.<br> It'll be a week at least<br> before they call on me.<br> Only a week, and then they'll take you<br> away from me.<br> Scarlett, I thought of you<br> at our wedding yesterday...<br> ...and I hoped that yours would be<br> as beautiful, and it was.<br> Was it?<br> Now we're really and truly sisters.<br> -Charles.<br> -Melanie.<br> Don't cry, darling,<br> the war will be over in a few weeks...<br> ...and I'll be coming back to you.<br> Miss Scarlett!<br> Well, I don't care.<br> I'm too young to be a widow.<br> Miss Scarlett!<br> Why, I just go around scaring people<br> in that thing.<br> You ain't supposed to be around people.<br> You's in mournin'.<br> For what? I don't feel anything.<br> Why should I have to pretend<br> and pretend....<br> What is it?<br> Oh, baby....<br> What is it?<br> My life is over.<br> Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.<br> Oh, Mother.<br> I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br> but I just can't bear going around in black.<br> It's bad enough not being able<br> to go to any parties...<br> ...but looking this way too.<br> I don't think you're at all horrible.<br> It's only natural to want to look young<br> and be young when you are young.<br> Oh, baby....<br> How would you like<br> to go visiting somewhere?<br> Savannah perhaps?<br> What would I do in Savannah?<br> Well, Atlanta then.<br> There's lots going on there.<br> And you could stay<br> with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.<br> Melanie.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I could, couldn't l?<br> Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br> sweeter than anybody in the world.<br> You'd like it, really?<br> All right then.<br> Now stop your crying and smile.<br> You can take Prissy with you.<br> Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br> Mammy.<br> I'll go write the necessary letters.<br> Atlanta!<br> Savannah would be better for you.<br> You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.<br> What trouble are you talking about?<br> You know what trouble I's talkin' about.<br> I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.<br> He'll be comin' to Atlanta<br> when he gets his leave...<br> ...and you're sittin' there waitin'<br> for him just like a spider!<br> -He belongs to Miss Melanie--<br> -You go pack my things like Mother said.<br> They're all whispering,<br> and I just know it's about her.<br> What's it matter what they say,<br> Aunt Pittypat?<br> But Scarlett is living under my roof<br> so they all think I'm responsible for her...<br> ...and for a widow to appear in public<br> at a social gathering!<br> Every time I think of it I feel faint!<br> Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br> only to help raise money for the cause.<br> It was splendid of her<br> to make the sacrifice.<br> Anyone would think, to hear you talk...<br> ...that she came here to dance<br> instead of to sell things.<br> Ladies and gentlemen!<br> I have important news! Glorious news!<br> Another triumph<br> for our magnificent men in arms.<br> General Lee has completely<br> whipped the enemy.<br> And swept the Yankee Army<br> northward from Virginia.<br> And now, a happy surprise for all of us.<br> We have with us tonight that most daring<br> of all blockade-runners...<br> ...whose fleet schooners,<br> slipping past the Yankee guns...<br> ...have brought us here the very woolens<br> and laces we wear tonight.<br> I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br> will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.<br> None other than our friend<br> from Charleston...<br> ...Captain Rhett Butler!<br> Permit me.<br> Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure<br> to see you again.<br> I met you last at my husband's home.<br> That's kind of you to remember,<br> Mrs. Wilkes.<br> Did you meet Captain Butler<br> at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?<br> Yes. I, I think so.<br> Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br> It was in the library.<br> You had broken something.<br> Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.<br> Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br> your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.<br> We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.<br> Wait.<br> On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br> and Mrs. Hamilton.<br> Thank you, Captain Butler.<br> Just a moment, please.<br> But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.<br> It may help my husband more,<br> off my finger.<br> Thank you.<br> That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br> Mrs. Wilkes.<br> Here.<br> You can have mine, too, for the cause.<br> And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br> I know just how much that means to you.<br> -Melanie!<br> -Yes, Dr. Meade.<br> I need your approval,<br> as a member of the Committee...<br> ...for something we want to do<br> that's rather shocking.<br> Will you excuse us, please?<br> I'll say one thing, the war makes<br> the most peculiar widows.<br> I wish you'd go away.<br> If you had any raising you'd know<br> I never want to see you again.<br> Now, why be silly?<br> You've no reason for hating me.<br> I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.<br> I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br> to hate one of the great heroes of the war.<br> I do declare I was surprised to see<br> you turn out to be such a noble character.<br> I can't bear to take advantage<br> of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.<br> I'm neither noble nor heroic.<br> But you are a blockade-runner.<br> For profit, and profit only.<br> Are you telling me<br> you don't believe in the cause?<br> I believe in Rhett Butler.<br> He's the only cause I know.<br> The rest doesn't mean much to me.<br> And now, ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...l have a startling surprise<br> for the benefit of the hospital.<br> Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br> reel with the lady of your choice...<br> ...you must bid for her.<br> Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br> your husband to conduct this...<br> ...this slave auction?<br> Dolly Merriwether,<br> how dare you criticize me!<br> Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...<br> ...that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br> it's quite all right.<br> She did!<br> Oh dear, oh dear.<br> Where are my smelling salts?<br> I think I shall faint.<br> Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.<br> If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.<br> Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br> Make your offers.<br> Don't be bashful, gentlemen.<br> Twenty dollars,<br> $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.<br> Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.<br> Only $25 to give your--<br> One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.<br> For what lady, sir?<br> For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.<br> For whom, sir?<br> Mrs. Charles Hamilton.<br> Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br> Captain Butler...<br> ...but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br> would be proud to--<br> Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.<br> She will not consider it, sir.<br> Oh yes, I will.<br> Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.<br> We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.<br> It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?<br> It's worse.<br> But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.<br> I don't care what you expect<br> or what they think.<br> I'm going to dance and dance.<br> Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing<br> with Abe Lincoln himself.<br> Another dance and my reputation<br> will be lost forever.<br> With enough courage,<br> you can do without a reputation.<br> Oh, you do talk scandalous.<br> You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.<br> Don't start flirting with me.<br> I'm not one of your plantation beaux.<br> I want more than flirting from you.<br> What do you want?<br> I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br> that Southern belle simper off your face.<br> Some day I want you to say to me...<br> ...the words I heard you say<br> to Ashley Wilkes:<br> "l love you."<br> That's something you'll never hear from<br> me, Captain Butler, as long as you live.<br> How sweet, how kind.<br> He is a thoughtful gentleman.<br> Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say<br> something about my sacrifice?<br> Oh, the darling thing.<br> Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.<br> You didn't really bring it all the way<br> from Paris just for me.<br> Yes, I thought it was about time<br> I got you out of that fake mourning.<br> Next trip I'll bring you some green silk<br> for a frock to match it.<br> Oh, Rhett.<br> It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br> to keep our girls at home looking pretty.<br> Oh, it's so long<br> since I've had anything new.<br> How do I look?<br> Awful! Just awful.<br> Why, what's the matter?<br> This war has stopped being a joke...<br> ...when a girl like you doesn't know how<br> to wear the latest fashion.<br> Oh, Rhett, let me do it.<br> But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.<br> You will though.<br> And another thing, those pantalettes.<br> I don't know a woman in Paris<br> that wears pantalettes anymore.<br> Oh, what do they...?<br> You shouldn't talk about such things.<br> You little hypocrite.<br> You don't mind my knowing about them,<br> just my talking.<br> But, I really can't go on accepting gifts<br> from you, though you are awfully kind.<br> I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.<br> I never give anything without expecting<br> something in return. I always get paid.<br> If you think I'll marry you to pay<br> for the bonnet, I won't.<br> Don't flatter yourself.<br> I'm not a marrying man.<br> Well, I won't kiss you for it either.<br> Open your eyes and look at me.<br> No, I don't think I will kiss you...<br> ...although you need kissing badly.<br> That's what's wrong with you.<br> You should be kissed and often.<br> And by someone who knows how.<br> Oh, and I suppose you think<br> you're the proper person.<br> I might be, if the right moment ever came.<br> You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br> Rhett Butler.<br> And I don't know why<br> I let you come and see me.<br> I'll tell you why, Scarlett.<br> Because I'm the only man over 16<br> and under 60...<br> ...who's around to show you a good time.<br> But cheer up,<br> the war can't last much longer.<br> Oh really, Rhett? Why?<br> There's a battle going on right now<br> that ought to pretty well fix things...<br> ...one way or the other.<br> Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?<br> You still haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br> Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.<br> Yes, I suppose he's in it.<br> Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?<br> Some little town in Pennsylvania<br> called Gettysburg.<br> Here you is, Miss Melanie.<br> They was fightin' for them<br> so it just got tore in half.<br> Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.<br> Wellman, Wendell, White,<br> Whitner, Wilkins...<br> ...Williams, Woolsey, Workman.<br> Scarlett, you've passed him.<br> Oh, he isn't there!<br> He isn't there!<br> Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.<br> Oh, he's safe, he's safe.<br> Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br> to worry about Ashley like this for me.<br> I must go to her.<br> Don't, my dear, not here.<br> Let's go home.<br> Dr. Meade, not....<br> Yes, our boy, Darcy.<br> I was making these mittens for him.<br> He won't need them now.<br> Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show 'em.<br> I'll kill all those Yankees.<br> Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.<br> Do you think it will help your mother<br> to have you off getting shot too?<br> I never heard of anything so silly.<br> It's a black day, Scarlett.<br> You haven't had bad news, have you?<br> Ashley's safe.<br> I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.<br> But, Rhett, there are so many others.<br> Many of your friends?<br> Just about every family in the county.<br> The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.<br> Yes, look at them.<br> All these poor tragic people.<br> The South's sinking to its knees.<br> It'll never rise again.<br> The cause....<br> The cause of living in the past is dying<br> right in front of us.<br> I never heard you talk like that before.<br> I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br> And that's what all this is, sheer waste.<br> But don't you be downcast.<br> Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br> to the women who love him...<br> ...both of them.<br> Oh, you're here.<br> Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.<br> Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.<br> Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.<br> Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.<br> Scarlett, dear.<br> Well, is this any way to greet<br> a returning warrior?<br> Ashley, l....<br> Merry Christmas, Ashley.<br> Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br> We've got all your wives.<br> We've got all your little chicks.<br> You got nobody to worry your head<br> about leavin'.<br> Come on.<br> Now you just stand still so you can be<br> a Christmas gift for the white folks.<br> Now hold on.<br> Hold on!<br> Don't go gettin' so uppity...<br> ...even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.<br> Let's not talk about the war.<br> It's Christmas.<br> Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara<br> and all the times before the war.<br> Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?<br> Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br> Uncle Peter?<br> There's plenty. It's the very last<br> of my father's fine Madeira.<br> He got it from his uncle,<br> Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...<br> ...who married his cousin,<br> Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...<br> ...who was his second cousin once removed<br> and a kin to the Wilkeses too.<br> I saved it to wish Ashley<br> a Merry Christmas.<br> But you mustn't drink it all at once<br> because it is the last.<br> I meant it, my dear.<br> It was a lovely Christmas gift.<br> Only generals have tunics like this,<br> nowadays.<br> I'm so happy you like it, dear.<br> Where did you get the cloth?<br> It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.<br> I nursed her son while he was in<br> the hospital, Ashley, before he died and....<br> Oh, you will take good care of it,<br> won't you?<br> You won't let it get torn.<br> Promise me.<br> You mustn't worry.<br> I'll bring it back to you<br> without any holes in it, I promise.<br> Good night, my dear.<br> Good night, Scarlett, darling.<br> Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br> for Mr. Ashley to leave?<br> Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.<br> She isn't going to the depot with him?<br> She hasn't changed her mind?<br> No, ma'am. She's layin' down.<br> She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her<br> she can't even come downstairs.<br> Ashley!<br> Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.<br> Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br> as you are now...<br> ...not shivering at the depot.<br> All right.<br> Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.<br> Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.<br> Tie it on me, my dear.<br> While Melly was making your new tunic,<br> I made this to go with it.<br> You made it yourself?<br> Well, then I shall value it all the more.<br> You know there's nothing<br> I wouldn't do for you.<br> There's something you can do for me.<br> What is it?<br> Will you look after Melanie for me?<br> She's so frail and gentle<br> and she loves you so much.<br> You see, if I were killed and she--<br> Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br> Say a prayer quickly.<br> You say one for me.<br> We shall need all our prayers<br> now the end is coming.<br> The end?<br> The end of the war.<br> And the end of our world, Scarlett.<br> But, Ashley, you don't think<br> the Yankees are beating us?<br> Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...<br> ...and the snow in Virginia is deep.<br> When I see them...<br> ...and I see the Yankees coming<br> and coming, always more and more....<br> Well, when the end does come<br> I shall be far away.<br> It'll be a comfort to me to know<br> that she has you.<br> You will promise, won't you?<br> Yes.<br> Is that all, Ashley?<br> All except, goodbye.<br> Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.<br> -You must be brave--<br> -No....<br> You must.<br> How else can I bear going?<br> Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br> and strong and beautiful.<br> Not just your sweet face, my dear...<br> ...but you.<br> Oh, Ashley, kiss me.<br> Kiss me goodbye!<br> No, Scarlett.<br> Oh, Ashley, I love you.<br> I've always loved you.<br> I never loved anyone else.<br> I only married Charles just to hurt you.<br> Oh, Ashley. Tell me you love me.<br> I'll live on it the rest of my life.<br> Goodbye.<br> When the war is over, Ashley.<br> When the war is over.<br> And there's a place back home...<br> ...where a wild plum tree comes to flower<br> in the springtime.<br> Down by the creek, you know.<br> Yes, I know, I know.<br> When we were little,<br> my brother, Jeff, and I used to....<br> I told you about my brother, Jeff,<br> didn't l, ma'am?<br> I know I did.<br> He....<br> We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.<br> Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br> anything and....<br> Please, we must have<br> your temperature now.<br> Just take this in your mouth<br> and not talk anymore.<br> Not just now.<br> Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.<br> Aren't you tired, Melanie?<br> No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.<br> This might be...<br> ...Ashley.<br> And only strangers here to comfort him.<br> No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.<br> They could all be...<br> ...Ashley.<br> I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour<br> waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.<br> Go on, you trash,<br> don't you be pesterin' these ladies.<br> Don't talk to her, Melly.<br> It's all right, Scarlett.

I'm a Confederate<br> like everybody else, that's all.<br> Of course you are.<br> There's some folks here<br> wouldn't feel that way.<br> But maybe they ain't<br> as good Christians as you.<br> Look, Mrs. Meade.<br> It's a great deal of money.<br> Ten, $20, $30, $50.<br> And it's not our paper money. It's gold.<br> Let me see that handkerchief.<br> "R.

I'm so scared.<br> I wish I could get out of here.<br> Let's get out of here together.<br> No use staying here and letting the South<br> come down around your ears.<br> There are too many nice places<br> to go and visit.<br> Mexico, London, Paris....<br> -With you?<br> -Yes, ma'am.<br> With a man who understands you<br> and admires you for just what you are.<br> I figure we belong together,<br> being the same sort.<br> I've been waiting for you to grow up and<br> get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.<br> Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have<br> a baby in another month or so.<br> It'll be hard loving a man<br> with a wife and baby clinging to him.<br> Well, here we are. Are you going with me,<br> or are you getting out?<br> I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,<br> and I'll hate and despise you till I die.<br> Oh no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.<br> Miss Scarlett!

I want my mother.<br> My mother needs me.<br> Now you've got to listen to me.<br> You must stay here!<br> Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?<br> It simply isn't done!<br> Good heavens, woman, this is war,<br> not a garden party!<br> You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.<br> Oh, bother Melanie.<br> She's ill already.<br> She shouldn't even be having a baby.<br> She may have a difficult time.<br> Well, can't we take her along?<br> Do you want her to take that chance?<br> Do you want her to be jounced<br> over rough roads...<br> ...and have her baby ahead of time,<br> in a buggy?<br> It isn't my baby! You take care of her!<br> Scarlett!

We's here!<br> -Rhett, I knew you'd come.<br> Good evening. Nice weather we're having.<br> Prissy tells me you're planning<br> on taking a trip.<br> If you make any jokes now I'll kill you!<br> Don't tell me you're frightened.<br> I'm scared to death. If you had the sense<br> of a goat, you'd be scared too.<br> Oh, the Yankees.<br> No, not yet.<br> That's what's left of our Army,<br> blowing up the ammunition...<br> ...so the Yankees won't get it.<br> We've got to get out of here.<br> At your service, Madam.<br> Just where are you figuring on going?<br> Home, to Tara.<br> Don't you know that they've been fighting<br> all day around Tara?<br> Do you think you can parade through<br> the Yankee Army...<br> ...with a sick woman,<br> a baby and a simple-minded darky...<br> ...or do you intend leaving them behind?<br> They're going with me and I'm going home<br> and you can't stop me!<br> Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing<br> Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?<br> I want my mother!<br> I want to go home to Tara!<br> Tara's probably been burned to the ground.<br> The woods are full of stragglers<br> from both armies.<br> The least they'll do is take the horse<br> away from you...<br> ...and even though it isn't<br> much of an animal...<br> ...l did have a lot of trouble stealing it.<br> I'm going home if I have to walk<br> every step of the way.<br> I'll kill you if you try to stop me.<br> I will, I will!<br> I will!<br> All right, darling, all right.<br> Now you shall go home.<br> I guess anybody who did what you've done<br> today can take care of Sherman.<br> Here, now.

What are you doing?<br> I's packin', Miss Scarlett.<br> Stop it and come get the baby.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Melly!<br> Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.<br> Tara....<br> -It's the only way, Melly.<br> -No.<br> Sherman will burn the house<br> over our heads if we stay.<br> It's all right, Melly.<br> My baby.<br> My poor baby.<br> Have you the strength to put your arms<br> around my neck?<br> I think so.<br> Never mind.<br> Oh, Ashley, Charles....<br> What is it? What does she want?<br> Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.<br> She wants us to bring them.<br> Get them.<br> What's that?<br> Our gallant lads must have set fire<br> to the warehouses near the depot.<br> There's enough ammunition in the box cars<br> to blow us to Tara.<br> We'll have to hurry to get<br> across the tracks.<br> -You're not going that way!<br> -We have to.<br> The McDonough Road's the only one<br> the Yankees haven't cut yet.<br> Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> At you, locking the Yankees out.<br> Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.<br> I wouldn't be in such a hurry<br> to see them go if I were you.<br> With them goes the last semblance<br> of law and order.<br> The scavengers aren't wasting any time.<br> We've got to get out of here, fast.<br> There's a horse!<br> Down the alley, cut them off.<br> Give me that horse.<br> Miss Scarlett!<br> They haven't left much for the Yankees<br> to take, have they?<br> We'll have to make a dash for it<br> before the fire reaches that ammunition.<br> Come on!<br> Throw me your shawl.<br> Sorry, but you'll like it better<br> if you don't see anything.<br> Take a good look, my dear.<br> It's a historic moment.<br> You can tell your grandchildren how you<br> watched the old South disappear one night.<br> They were going to lick the Yankees<br> in a month.<br> The poor gallant fools!<br> They make me sick, all of them!<br> Getting us all into this<br> with their swaggering and boasting.<br> That's the way I felt once<br> about their swaggering and boasting.<br> Rhett, I'm so glad you aren't<br> with the Army.<br> You can be proud, now, proud that you've<br> been smarter than all of them.<br> I'm not so proud.<br> Why did you stop?<br> This is the turn to Tara.<br> Let the horse breathe a bit.<br> Mrs. Wilkes.<br> Miss Melly done fainted way back,<br> Cap'n Butler.<br> Well, she's probably better off.<br> She couldn't stand the pain<br> if she were conscious.<br> Scarlett, are you still determined to do<br> this crazy thing?<br> Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.<br> I'm sure we can.<br> Not we, my dear, you.<br> I'm leaving you here.<br> You're what? Rhett, where are you going?<br> I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.<br> You're joking!<br> I could kill you for scaring me so!<br> I'm very serious, Scarlett.<br> I'm going to join up<br> with our brave lads in gray.<br> But they're running away!<br> No. They'll turn and make a last stand,<br> if I know anything about them.<br> When they do, I'll be with them.<br> A little late, but "Better late--"<br> Rhett, you must be joking!<br> Selfish to the end, aren't you?<br> Thinking only of your own precious hide,<br> with never a thought for the noble cause.<br> Rhett, how could you do this to me...<br> ...and why should you go now,<br> after it's all over and I need you?<br> Why? Why?<br> Why?<br> Maybe it's because I've always had<br> a weakness for lost causes...<br> ...once they're really lost.<br> Or maybe...<br> ...maybe I'm ashamed of myself.<br> Who knows?<br> You should die of shame<br> to leave me here alone and helpless!<br> You helpless?<br> Heaven help the Yankees<br> if they capture you!<br> Now, climb down here.<br> I want to say goodbye.<br> No!<br> Climb down.<br> Oh, Rhett, please don't go.<br> You can't leave me, please.<br> I'll never forgive you!<br> I'm not asking you to forgive me.<br> I'll never understand or forgive myself.<br> And if a bullet gets me, so help me,<br> I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.<br> But there's one thing I do know...<br> ...and that is that I love you, Scarlett.<br> In spite of you and me and the whole<br> silly world going to pieces around us...<br> ...l love you...<br> ...because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.<br> Selfish and shrewd...<br> ...but able to look things in the eyes<br> and call them by their right names.<br> Don't hold me like that!<br> Scarlett, look at me.<br> I love you more<br> than I've ever loved any woman.<br> And I've waited longer for you<br> than I've ever waited for any woman.<br> Let me alone!<br> Here's a soldier of the South<br> who loves you, Scarlett...<br> ...wants to feel your arms around him...<br> ...wants to carry the memory<br> of your kisses into battle with him.<br> Never mind about loving me.<br> You're a woman sending a soldier<br> to his death with a beautiful memory.<br> Scarlett, kiss me.<br> Kiss me, once.<br> You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!<br> They were right! Everybody was right!<br> You aren't a gentleman!<br> A minor point at such a moment.<br> Here.<br> If anyone lays a hand on that nag,<br> shoot him.<br> But don't make a mistake<br> and shoot the nag.<br> Oh, go on. I want you to go.<br> I hope a cannon ball lands slap on you.<br> I hope you're blown into a million pieces!<br> Never mind the rest.<br> I follow your general idea.<br> And when I'm dead on the altar<br> of my country...<br> ...l hope your conscience hurts you.<br> Goodbye, Scarlett.<br> Come on, you!

Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> It's hard to be strict with a man<br> who loses money so pleasantly.<br> -Rhett!<br> -Scarlett!<br> My dear little sister.<br> It's all right, Corporal.<br> My sister has brought me no files or saws.<br> Can I really kiss you now?<br> On the forehead like a good brother.<br> No, thanks.<br> I'll wait and hope for better things.<br> Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed<br> when I heard you were in jail.<br> I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.<br> It's not true, they're going to hang you?<br> Would you be sorry?<br> -Oh, Rhett!<br> -Well, don't worry, yet.<br> They have plotted<br> some charge against me...<br> ...but they're really after my money.<br> They think I made off<br> with the Confederate Treasury.<br> Well, did you?<br> What a leading question.<br> But let's not talk<br> about sordid things like money.<br> How good of you to come and see me.<br> And how pretty you look.<br> Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,<br> teasing a country girl like me.<br> Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br> I'm tired of seeing women in rags.<br> Turn around.<br> Marvelous! You look good enough to eat.<br> And prosperous, too.<br> Thank you, I've been doing very well.<br> Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...<br> ...l got so bored I just thought<br> I'd treat myself to a visit to town.<br> You're a heartless creature.<br> But that's part of your charm.<br> You know you've got more charm<br> than the law allows.<br> Now I didn't come here<br> to talk silliness about me, Rhett.<br> I came because I was so miserable<br> at the thought of you in trouble.<br> I was mad at you the night you left me<br> on the road to Tara...<br> ...and I still haven't forgiven you.<br> Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.<br> Well, I must admit I might not be alive,<br> now, only for you.<br> And when I think of myself<br> with everything I could possibly hope for...<br> ...and not a care in the world,<br> and you here in this horrid jail...<br> ...and not even a human jail, Rhett,<br> a horse jail.<br> Oh, listen to me trying<br> to make jokes when...<br> ...when I really want to cry.<br> In a minute I shall cry.<br> Scarlett, can it be possible that....<br> Can what be possible, Rhett?<br> That you've grown a woman's heart,<br> a real woman's heart?<br> I have, Rhett. I know I have.<br> You know, it's worth being in jail<br> just to hear you say that.<br> It's well worth it.<br> You can drop the moonlight<br> and magnolias, Scarlett.<br> So things have been going well<br> at Tara, have they?<br> What have you done with your hands?<br> I went riding last week<br> without my gloves.<br> These don't belong to a lady.<br> You've worked with them like a field hand.<br> Why did you lie? What are you up to?<br> In another minute I'd have believed<br> you cared something.<br> But I do care.<br> Suppose we get down to the truth.<br> You want something from me badly enough<br> to put on quite a show in your velvets.<br> What is it? Money?<br> I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.<br> I did lie to you<br> when I said everything was all right.<br> Things are just as bad as they possibly<br> could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.<br> What collateral are you offering?<br> -My earbobs.<br> -Not interested.<br> -A mortgage on Tara.<br> -What would I do with a farm?<br> You wouldn't lose.<br> I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.<br> Not good enough.<br> Have you nothing better?<br> You once said you loved me.<br> If you still love me, Rhett....<br> You haven't forgotten<br> that I'm not a marrying man.<br> No, I haven't forgotten.<br> You're not worth $300.<br> You'll never mean anything<br> but misery to any man.<br> Go on, insult me.<br> I don't care what you say,<br> only give me the money.<br> I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go<br> while there's a breath left in my body.<br> Oh, Rhett.<br> Won't you please give me the money?<br> I couldn't give you the money<br> if I wanted to.<br> My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.<br> If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be<br> on me like a duck on a June bug.<br> So you see, my dear,<br> you've abased yourself to no purpose.<br> Here, here, here, stop it!<br> Want the Yankees to see you like this?<br> Take your hands off me, you skunk.<br> You knew what I was going to say<br> before I started.<br> You knew you wouldn't lend me the money<br> and yet you let me go on.<br> I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.<br> Cheer up. You can come to my hanging<br> and I'll remember you in my will.<br> I'll come to your hanging.<br> The only thing I'm afraid of...<br> ...is that they won't hang you in time<br> to pay the taxes on Tara.<br> Tell him Belle Watlin'.<br> Where you been lately?<br> Thought you deserted Captain Butler.<br> Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.<br> Who that? I ain't never see'd hair<br> that color before in my life.<br> Does you know a dyed-hair woman?<br> I wish I did know that one.<br> She'd get my money for me.<br> No matter what they done to you<br> in that jail...<br> ...they didn't do no more<br> than you deserve...<br> ...for visitin' white trash in a jail!<br> Fresh and green.<br> Right off the farm.<br> Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy?<br> That's one of them Georgia peaches.<br> There's nothing like that in Ohio.<br> -You know what we're going to do?<br> -What?<br> We're going to give every last one of you<br> -And a mule?<br> -Forty acres and a mule!<br> Gee!<br> 'Cause we're your friends...<br> ...and you're gonna become voters...<br> ...and you're gonna vote<br> like your friends do!<br> What's your hurry, sister?<br> What's come over this here town?<br> Yankees have come over it!<br> Same as they've come over all of us.<br> Out of our way, trash!<br> Get out of the way here.<br> Get away! Go on!<br> Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!<br> -Why Frank Kennedy!<br> -And Mammy!<br> It sure is good to see home folks.<br> I didn't know you were in Atlanta.<br> I didn't know you were.<br> Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br> about my store?<br> Did she? I don't remember.<br> Have you a store?<br> Won't you come in, and look around a bit?<br> I don't suppose it looks like much<br> to a lady, but...<br> ...l can't help being proud of it.<br> You're not making money?<br> Well, I can't complain.<br> In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.<br> Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.<br> It won't be long now<br> before Miss Suellen and I can marry.<br> Are you doing as well as all that?<br> Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.<br> I'm no millionaire yet...<br> ...but I've cleared $1,000 already.<br> And lumber too.<br> Well...<br> ...that's only a sideline.<br> A sideline, Frank?<br> With all the good Georgia pine around<br> Atlanta and all this building going on?<br> Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...<br> ...and I've got to be thinking<br> about buying a home.<br> What do you want a home for?<br> For Miss Suellen and me<br> to set up housekeeping.<br> Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br> to Atlanta, wouldn't you?<br> There wouldn't be much help<br> in that for Tara.<br> I don't rightly know what you mean,<br> Miss Scarlett.<br> I don't mean a thing.<br> Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br> to my Aunt Pitty's?<br> Nothing would give me<br> more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.<br> You'd better stay to supper, too.<br> I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br> and I'd like a good long visit with you.<br> Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br> Miss Scarlett.<br> And will you tell me all the news...<br> ...all the news of Miss Suellen?<br> What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?<br> Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?<br> Oh, no, no.<br> I thought surely she had written you.<br> I guess she was ashamed to write you.<br> She should be ashamed.<br> Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.<br> You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br> Don't leave me on tenterhooks.<br> Well, she's going to marry<br> one of the county boys next month.<br> She just got tired of waiting<br> and was afraid she'd be an old maid and....<br> Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.<br> Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home.<br> Would you mind<br> if I put my hand in your pocket?<br> But, Melanie, you don't realize<br> what she's done.<br> She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.<br> He's my beau,<br> and she's gone and married him.<br> She did it to save Tara,<br> you must understand that.<br> I hate Tara!<br> And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br> I hate worse than Tara.<br> It's all my fault.<br> I should have committed highway robbery<br> to get that tax money for you.<br> I couldn't let you do<br> anything like that, and....<br> Well, anyway, it's done now.<br> Yes, it's done now.<br> You wouldn't let me<br> do anything dishonorable...<br> ...but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br> to a man you didn't love.<br> Well, at least you won't have to worry<br> about my helplessness anymore.<br> What do you mean?<br> I'm going to New York.<br> I've arranged to get a position<br> in a bank there.<br> But you can't do that.<br> I counted on you to help me start<br> a lumber business, Ashley...<br> ...and, well, I counted on you.<br> I wouldn't be any good to you.<br> I don't know anything<br> about the lumber business.<br> You know as much as you do<br> about banking.<br> And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.<br> That's generous of you, Scarlett.<br> But it isn't that.<br> If I go to Atlanta<br> and take help from you again...<br> ...l'd bury forever any hope<br> of standing alone.<br> Oh, is that all?<br> Well, you could gradually buy the business<br> and then it would be your own, and....<br> No, Scarlett.<br> Ashley....<br> Ashley.<br> Scarlett!<br> Scarlett, what is it?<br> Ashley's so mean and hateful.<br> What have you done?<br> She wanted me to go to Atlanta.<br> To help me start my lumber business, and<br> he won't lift a finger to help me, and he....<br> Why, how unchivalrous of you.<br> Why, think, Ashley, think.<br> If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br> I'd have died in Atlanta.<br> And maybe we wouldn't have had<br> little Beau, and...<br> ...and when I think of her picking cotton<br> and plowing just to keep food...<br> ...in our mouths, I could just....<br> Oh, my darling.<br> All right, Melanie.<br> I'll go to Atlanta.<br> I can't fight you both.<br> Well, here's your new mill hands,<br> Mrs. Kennedy.<br> The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.<br> They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br> Gallegher.<br> Halt!<br> They're the best you can lease, ma'am.<br> And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher<br> a free hand...<br> ...you'll get what you want out of them.<br> All right, you're the foreman.<br> All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br> and deliver my lumber when I want it.<br> Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.<br> But remember...<br> ...no questions and no interference.<br> That's a bargain.<br> Start them in the morning, Gallegher.<br> Come on, get a move on!<br> Come on, move on there!<br> But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br> and you know it.<br> It's bad enough for a woman<br> to be in business, but--<br> What are you complaining about?<br> You wouldn't have owned a mill<br> had I not taken over.<br> I didn't want the mill,<br> and we couldn't have bought it...<br> ...if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br> for the money they owed me.<br> Isn't that right, Ashley?<br> What are you running,<br> a charitable institution?<br> Go back to the store,<br> then go home and take your medicine.<br> You're not looking very well.<br> But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br> with me?<br> Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br> anymore, and don't call me sugar!<br> All right, all right.<br> Good night, Ashley.<br> She can get mad quicker<br> than any woman I ever saw.<br> Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...<br> ...l do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br> instead of using convicts.<br> I believe we could do better.<br> Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br> and convicts are dirt cheap.<br> If we just give Gallegher a free hand--<br> A free hand! You know what that means.<br> He'll starve them and whip them.<br> Some of them are sick, underfed....<br> Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.<br> Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br> three times a day and...<br> ...tucking them to sleep<br> with eiderdown quilts.<br> Scarlett, I will not make money out<br> of the enforced labor and misery of others.<br> You weren't so particular<br> about owning slaves.<br> That was different.<br> We didn't treat them that way.<br> Besides, I'd have freed them all<br> when father died...<br> ...if the war hadn't already freed them.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.<br> But have you forgotten<br> what it's like without money?<br> I found out that money is<br> the most important thing in the world...<br> ...and I don't intend ever to be<br> without it again.<br> I'll make enough so the Yankees can never<br> take Tara away from me.<br> I'll make it the only way I know how.<br> But we're not the only Southerners<br> who have suffered.<br> Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br> their honor and their kindness, too.<br> And they're starving. I've got no use<br> for fools who won't help themselves.<br> I know what they're saying about me,<br> and I don't care.<br> I'll make friends<br> with the Yankee carpetbaggers.<br> And I'll beat them at their own game,<br> and you'll beat them with me.<br> That's it. Move it a little over to that side.<br> Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Business is certainly growing, ain't it?<br> It certainly is.<br> But you're doing business<br> with the same people who robbed us...<br> ...and tortured us and left us to starve.<br> All that's past, Melly.<br> And I intend to make the best of things,<br> even if they are Yankee things.<br> And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br> that Dr. Meade actually saw her...<br> ...peddling lumber<br> to those Yankees, herself.<br> And that isn't all....<br> I think it's shocking what she's doing<br> to my brother, Ashley.<br> She's even taken to driving her own buggy.<br> My dear Mrs. Kennedy.<br> My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.<br> I don't see how you have<br> the gall to face me.<br> When I think you could have had<br> my millions...<br> ...if you'd just waited a little while.<br> Oh, how fickle is woman!<br> What is it you want?<br> I have important things to do.<br> Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br> which has bothered me for some time?<br> Well, what is it? Be quick.<br> Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br> from marrying men you don't love?<br> How did you ever get out of jail?<br> Why didn't they hang you?<br> Oh, that! Not much trouble.<br> There's nothing much<br> that money won't buy.<br> I observe it's even bought you<br> the honorable Mr. Wilkes.<br> So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.<br> Do you know,<br> I believe you're jealous of him.<br> You still think you're the belle<br> of the county, don't you?<br> That you're the cutest little trick<br> in shoe leather.<br> And that every man you meet<br> is dying of love for you.<br> Let me by!<br> Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br> Tell me, where are you going?<br> To the mill, if it's any of your business.<br> Through shantytown, alone?<br> Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br> to drive alone through all that riffraff?<br> Don't worry about me.<br> I can shoot straight<br> if I don't have to shoot too far.<br> What a woman!<br> Could ya gimme a quarter?<br> Let go of my horse!<br> Hold this horse!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Help!<br> Miss Scarlett!<br> Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!<br> Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!<br> Big Sam!<br> Miss Scarlett! Wait!<br> Sam! Sam!<br> Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br> Did they hurt you?<br> Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br> Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.<br> Horse, make tracks!<br> You get to Tara just as quick as you can,<br> and stay there.<br> I sure will.<br> I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.<br> Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br> Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br> Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.<br> Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br> to Miss Melly's for the evening.<br> I've got to go to a political meeting.<br> A political meeting!<br> How can you go to a political meeting...<br> ...after what I've been through<br> this afternoon?<br> Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.<br> Nobody cares about me.<br> You all act as though it was nothing at all.<br> The men talk, talk, talk<br> about protecting our women...<br> ...and after what happened to me today<br> Frank has to go to a political meeting.<br> And if it won't pain you too much,<br> lndia Wilkes...<br> ...l'd be much obliged<br> if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.<br> Has my face gone green or something?<br> It won't pain me!<br> What happened this afternoon was<br> just what you deserved!<br> And if there was any justice,<br> you'd have gotten worse.<br> India, hush up!<br> Let her talk, Melanie.<br> She's always hated me!<br> Ever since I took your brother<br> away from her...<br> ...though she's too much of a hypocrite<br> to admit it!<br> If she thought anyone'd go for her...<br> ...she'd walk down the street naked!<br> I do hate you!<br> You've done all you could<br> to lower the prestige of decent people.<br> Now you've endangered the lives<br> of our men, because they--<br> India!<br> I don't think we'd better say any more,<br> or one of us will be saying too much.<br> What's going on around here<br> that I don't know about?<br> Somebody's comin' up the walk.<br> Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.<br> Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br> Mrs. Meade?<br> Whoever it is...<br> ...we know nothing.<br> Where have they gone?<br> You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br> It's life or death!<br> Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.<br> Quickly, please! There may still be time.<br> How did you know?<br> I've been playing poker<br> with two Yankee captains.<br> They knew there'd be trouble tonight.<br> They've sent their cavalry out<br> to be ready for it.<br> Your husband and his friends are<br> walking into a trap.<br> Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!<br> Out the Decatur Road.<br> The old Sullivan plantation.<br> The house is burned.<br> They're meeting in the cellar.<br> I'll do what I can.<br> What's all this about?<br> lf you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!<br> We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.<br> But Ashley and Frank and the others<br> have gone to clean out those woods...<br> ...where you were attacked.<br> It's what a great many<br> of our Southern gentlemen have had...<br> ...to do lately for our protection.<br> And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br> Scarlett!<br> And it will be your fault!<br> Another word,<br> and you go out of this house, lndia!<br> Scarlett did what she thought<br> she had to do.<br> And our men are doing<br> what they think they have to do.<br> Frank!<br> And Ashley!<br> Oh, it isn't possible!<br> There's horses, Miss Melly.<br> Here they come.<br> You're sewing, you're sewing.<br> Open the door, Mammy.<br> Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.<br> Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?<br> I am Mrs. Wilkes.<br> I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br> if you please.<br> He's not here.<br> Are you sure?<br> Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.<br> I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.<br> If you'll give me your word,<br> I won't search the house.<br> Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br> a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.<br> He's not at the store,<br> and there's no meeting tonight!<br> No political meeting.<br> We'll wait outside<br> till he and his friends return.<br> Sergeant, surround the house.<br> Put a man on each door and window.<br> Yes, sir!<br> Keep on with your sewing, ladies.<br> And I'll read aloud.<br> "The Personal History and Experience<br> of David Copperfield.<br> "Chapter one.<br> "l'm born.<br> "To begin my life, with the beginning<br> of my life, I record that I was born.<br> "Chapter Nine.<br> I have a memorable birthday.<br> "l pass over all that happened at school...<br> "...until the anniversary of my birthday<br> came around in March.<br> "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br> admired than ever.<br> "l remember nothing.<br> "He was going away at the end<br> of the half year, if not sooner...<br> "...and was more spirited and independent<br> than before in my eyes...<br> "...and, therefore, more engaging<br> than before, but...<br> "...beyond this I remember nothing.<br> "The great...."<br> "l remember nothing."<br> Melly! They're drunk!<br> Leave this to me, Scarlett.<br> And, please, say nothing.<br> You stupid fool!<br> Quiet!<br> Will you shut up for the love of...?<br> Hello, Melly.<br> So, you've got my husband<br> intoxicated again, Captain Butler!<br> Well, bring him in.<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br> Your husband's under arrest.<br> If you arrest all the men<br> who get intoxicated...<br> ...you must have a good many Yankees<br> in jail.<br> Bring him in, Captain Butler.<br> If you can walk yourself.<br> I want to tell you a story....<br> Listen, Doctor, l....<br> Put him there in that chair.<br> And now, Captain Butler,<br> will you please leave my house...<br> ...and try to remember<br> not to come here again?<br> Well, now that's fine thanks I get<br> for bringing him home...<br> ...and not leaving him on the streets<br> in this shameful condition!<br> Now, boys, all together!<br> Dr. Meade...<br> ...l'm astonished at you!<br> Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?<br> I ain't so very drunk, Melly.<br> Take him into the bedroom<br> and lay him out on the bed as usual.<br> Don't touch him, he's under arrest!<br> Now, Tom.<br> What do you want to arrest him for?<br> I've seen him drunker.<br> I've seen you drunker!<br> And you've seen me....<br> He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br> I'm not a policeman.<br> But he led a raid tonight<br> on that shantytown...<br> ...where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br> this afternoon.<br> A lot of those shanties were burned.<br> A couple of men were killed.<br> It's about time you rebels learned you can't<br> take the law into your own hands.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> This isn't your night<br> to teach that lesson, Tom.<br> These two have been<br> with me tonight. Yes, sir.<br> With you, Rhett?<br> Where?<br> I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.<br> You'd better say.<br> Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.<br> Speak out, Captain Butler!<br> I think I have a right to know<br> where my husband's been.<br> Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br> on a friend of mine...<br> ...and the captain's.<br> A Mrs. Belle Watling.<br> We played cards, drank champagne and...<br> ...well....<br> Now, you've done it! Did you have to<br> show me up in front of my wife?<br> Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.<br> These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br> with their husbands tomorrow.<br> Rhett, I had no idea, l....<br> Look here, will you take an oath<br> that they were with you tonight at...<br> ...at Belle's?<br> Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br> She'll tell you, Captain.<br> Will you give me your word<br> as a gentleman?<br> As a gentleman?<br> Why certainly, Tom.<br> Well, if l...<br> ...if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.<br> I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I....<br> If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.<br> Well, I say I'm sorry, and...<br> ...well, I am sorry.<br> Come on, Sergeant.<br> Lock that door. Pull down the shades.<br> Ashley.<br> It's all right. It's only in the shoulder.<br> Get him on the bed<br> where I can dress the wound.<br> I think I can walk.<br> It's not worth the effort. Which way?<br> In here.<br> -Mammy, I want some hot water.<br> -Yes, sir.<br> -And lint for bandages.<br> -I'll find some.<br> Now what can I use for a probe?<br> lf I only had my bag.<br> Were you really there?<br> What did it look like?<br> Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br> plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?<br> Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br> remember yourself.<br> And now, Captain Butler,<br> tell me what happened, all that happened.<br> I was too late.<br> When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd<br> already been a skirmish with the Yankees.<br> I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br> and Dr. Meade was with him.<br> I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br> anyplace but where they were.<br> So I took them to Belle's.<br> And she took them in?<br> She's by way of being<br> an old friend of mine.<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I--<br> I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br> a more dignified alibi.<br> This isn't the first time you've come<br> between me and disaster, Captain Butler.<br> It isn't likely that I'd question<br> any device of yours.<br> And now, I'll go and see<br> what Dr. Meade needs.<br> Oh, Ashley!<br> Ashley!<br> Have you no interest in what's become<br> of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?<br> Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?<br> No.<br> Well, where is he?<br> He's lying out on Decatur Road...<br> ...shot through the head.<br> He's dead.<br> Who is it?<br> It's Miss Watlin'.<br> Oh, Mrs. Watling!<br> Won't you come in the house?<br> Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.<br> You come in and sit a minute with me.<br> How can I thank you enough<br> for what you did for us?<br> How can any of us thank you enough?<br> I got your note sayin' you was goin'<br> to call on me and thank me.<br> Why, Miss Wilkes,<br> you must have lost your mind.<br> I come up here as soon<br> as it was dark to tell you...<br> ...you mustn't even think of any such thing.<br> Why, I'm....<br> Why, you're....<br> Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all.<br> It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br> woman who saved my husband's life?<br> Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br> in this town nice to me like you was.<br> I mean, about the money<br> for the hospital, you know.<br> And I don't forget a kindness.<br> And I got to thinking about you being left<br> a widow with a little boy...<br> ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung...<br> ...and he's a nice little boy,<br> your boy is, Miss Wilkes.<br> I got a boy myself and so l....<br> Oh, you have? Does he live...?<br> Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.<br> He ain't never been here.<br> He's off at school.<br> I ain't seen him since he was little.<br> Well, anyway, if it had been<br> that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself...<br> ...l wouldn't have lifted a finger to,<br> no matter what Captain Butler said.<br> She's a mighty cold woman.<br> Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.<br> She killed her husband<br> same as if she shot him.<br> You mustn't say unkind things<br> about my sister-in-law.<br> Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.<br> I forgot how you liked her.<br> But she just ain't in the same class<br> with you and I can't help it if I think so.<br> Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.<br> I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br> this carriage if I stayed here any longer.<br> That wouldn't do you no good.<br> And Miss Wilkes...<br> ...if you ever see me on the street,<br> you don't have to speak to me.<br> I'll understand.<br> I should be proud to speak to you.<br> Proud to be under obligation to you.<br> I hope we meet again.<br> Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'.<br> -Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br> -Good night, Mrs. Watling.<br> And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.<br> She's brokenhearted about her husband.<br> Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.<br> Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here<br> to see you.<br> I told him you was prostrate with grief.<br> Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.<br> She says she's comin'.<br> I don't know why she's comin'.<br> But she's a-comin'.<br> You don't like me, Mammy.<br> Now don't you argue with me, you don't.<br> You really don't.<br> It's no good, Scarlett.<br> What?<br> The cologne.<br> I'm sure I don't know what you mean.<br> I mean you've been drinking.<br> Brandy. Quite a lot.<br> Well, what if I have?<br> ls that any of your affair?<br> Don't drink alone, Scarlett.<br> People always find out<br> and it ruins the reputation.<br> What is it?<br> This is more than losing old Frank.<br> Oh, Rhett...<br> ...l'm so afraid.<br> I don't believe it.<br> You've never been afraid in your life.<br> I'm afraid now.<br> I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.<br> You look pretty healthy,<br> and maybe there isn't any hell.<br> Oh, there is. I know there is.<br> I was raised on it.<br> Well, far be it from me to question<br> the teachings of childhood.<br> Tell me what you've done<br> that hell yawns before you.<br> I ought never to have married Frank<br> to begin with.<br> He was Suellen's beau<br> and he loved her, not me.<br> And I made him miserable.<br> And I killed him.<br> Yes, I did! I killed him!<br> For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br> to be sorry for something I've done.<br> Here. Dry your eyes.<br> If you had it all to do over again,<br> you'd do no differently.<br> You're like the thief who isn't<br> the least bit sorry he stole...<br> ...but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br> he's going to jail.<br> I'm glad Mother's dead.<br> I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.<br> I always wanted to be like her,<br> calm and kind and....<br> And I certainly have<br> turned out disappointing.<br> You know, Scarlett, I think you're<br> on the verge of a crying jag.<br> So I'll change the subject<br> and say what I came to say.<br> Say it, then, and get out!<br> What is it?<br> That I can't go on any longer without you.<br> You are the most ill-bred man to come here<br> at a time like this with your filthy--<br> I made up my mind that you were<br> the only woman for me...<br> ...the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.<br> Now that you've got the lumber mill<br> and Frank's money...<br> ...you won't come to me<br> as you did to the jail.<br> So I see I shall have to marry you.<br> I never heard of such bad taste.<br> Would you be more convinced<br> if I fell to my knees?<br> Turn me loose, you varmint,<br> and get out of here!<br> Forgive me for startling you<br> with the impetuosity of my sentiments...<br> ...my dear Scarlett.<br> I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.<br> But it cannot have escaped your notice<br> that for some time past...<br> ...the friendship I have felt for you<br> has ripened into a deeper feeling.<br> A feeling more beautiful,<br> more pure, more sacred.<br> Dare I name it? Can it be love?<br> Get up off your knees.<br> I don't like your common jokes.<br> This is an honorable proposal of marriage...<br> ...made at what I consider<br> a most opportune moment.<br> I can't go all my life waiting<br> to catch you between husbands.<br> You're coarse, and you're conceited.<br> And I think this conversation<br> has gone far enough.<br> Besides, I shall never marry again.<br> Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.<br> You? You!<br> I don't love you!<br> And I don't like being married.<br> Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?<br> Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br> Fun for men, you mean.<br> Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?<br> You've been married to a boy<br> and an old man.<br> Why not try a husband of the right age,<br> with a way with women?<br> You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br> I shall always love another man.<br> Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br> Stop it! No more of that talk.<br> Rhett, don't, I shall faint.<br> I want you to faint.<br> This is what you were meant for.<br> None of the fools you've known<br> have kissed you like this, have they?<br> Your Charles, or your Frank,<br> or your stupid Ashley.<br> Say you're going to marry me.<br> Say "yes." Say "yes! "<br> Yes.<br> Are you sure you meant it?<br> You don't want to take it back?<br> No.<br> Look at me and try to tell me the truth.<br> Did you say "yes" because of my money?<br> Well....<br> Yes. Partly.<br> Partly?<br> Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br> and, of course I am fond of you.<br> Fond of me.<br> Well, if I said I was madly in love with you,<br> you'd know I was lying...<br> ...but you always said<br> we had a lot in common....<br> Yes, you're right, my dear.<br> I'm not in love with you any more<br> than you are with me.<br> Heaven help the man<br> who ever really loves you.<br> What kind of a ring would you like,<br> my darling?<br> Oh, a diamond ring.<br> And do buy a great big one, Rhett.<br> You shall have the biggest<br> and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.<br> I'll take you to New Orleans<br> for the most expensive honeymoon...<br> ...my ill-gotten gains can buy.<br> Oh, that would be just heavenly.<br> And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br> for you, too.<br> Rhett, how wonderful, but...<br> ...you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?<br> Still the little hypocrite.<br> Rhett, aren't you going<br> to kiss me goodbye?<br> Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br> for one afternoon?<br> You're impossible.<br> You can go and I don't care<br> if you never come back.<br> But I will come back.<br> What are you thinking about, Scarlett?<br> I'm thinking about how rich we are.<br> Rhett, I can keep<br> the lumber business too, can't l?<br> Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.<br> Now that you're rich<br> you can tell everyone to go to the devil...<br> ...as you've always said you wanted to.<br> But you were the main one<br> I wanted to go to the devil.<br> Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br> I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.<br> Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those<br> chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?<br> If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br> you'll get as fat as Mammy...<br> ...then I'll divorce you.<br> Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br> something for Mammy, too?<br> Why should I buy her a present<br> when she called us both mules?<br> Mules? Why mules?<br> Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br> and get ourselves all slicked up...<br> ...like racehorses but we were just mules<br> in horse harness...<br> ...and we didn't fool anybody.<br> I never heard anything more true.<br> Mammy's a smart old soul...<br> ...and one of the few people I know<br> whose respect I'd like to have.<br> I won't give her a thing.<br> She doesn't deserve it.<br> Then I'll take her a petticoat.<br> My Mammy always said<br> when she went to heaven...<br> ...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br> so stiff that it would stand by itself...<br> ...and so rustly, the Lord would think<br> it was made of angels' wings.<br> Why, she won't take it from you.<br> She'd rather die than wear it.<br> That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br> just the same.<br> Wake up! Wake up!<br> You were having another nightmare.<br> Oh, Rhett.<br> When I was so cold and hungry and...<br> ...and so tired l...<br> ...l couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br> and I couldn't find it.<br> -Find what, honey?<br> -Oh, I don't know.<br> I always dream the same dream<br> and I never know.<br> It seems to be hidden in the mist.<br> Darling.<br> Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br> that I've found it and that I'm safe?<br> Dreams don't work that way, but when<br> you get used to being safe and warm...<br> ...you'll stop dreaming that dream.<br> And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br> that you are safe.<br> Would you do something<br> for me if I asked you?<br> You know I would.<br> Will you take me away from here?<br> Don't you like New Orleans?<br> Oh, I love New Orleans,<br> but I want to go home and visit Tara.<br> Will you take me to Tara?<br> Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br> We'll go tomorrow.<br> You get your strength<br> from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.<br> You're part of it, and it's part of you.<br> Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br> the way it was before the war.<br> Would you?<br> Then go ahead and make it that way.<br> Spend whatever you want,<br> make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.<br> Oh, Rhett.<br> Rhett, you are good to me.<br> And can we still have<br> our big new house in Atlanta?<br> Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want...<br> ...marbled terraces, stained-glass windows<br> and all.<br> Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?<br> I want everybody who's been mean to me<br> to be pea-green with envy.<br> I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br> building that new house just to show off...<br> ...and even taking our servants.<br> Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br> unkindly of her.<br> She's made it possible for us<br> to keep Tara always.<br> Yes, and what good is Tara?<br> She's had three husbands<br> and I'll be an old maid.<br> Great Jehosophat!<br> Great Jehosophat!<br> Lordsy, we sure is rich now!<br> It ain't quality....<br> But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?<br> I'm entitled to at least see<br> what my own child looks like.<br> You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br> You'll be seein' it for a long time.<br> I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br> about it's not being a boy.<br> Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br> Who wants a boy?<br> Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br> Don't you think I'm proof of that?<br> Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.<br> Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?<br> She sure is.<br> Did you ever see a prettier one?<br> Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br> that pretty when she come, but not quite.<br> Have another glass, Mammy.<br> What's that rustling noise I hear?<br> Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but<br> my red silk petticoat you done give me.<br> Nothing but your petticoat.<br> I don't believe it. Let me see.<br> Pull up your skirt.<br> Mr. Rhett. You is bad.<br> Yeah, oh, Lord!<br> You sure took a long enough time<br> about wearing it.<br> Yes, sir, too long.<br> No more mule in horse's harness?<br> Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br> tellin' you about that.<br> You ain't holdin' that<br> against old Mammy, is you?<br> No, I ain't holding it against you.<br> I just wanted to know.<br> Have another glass, Mammy.<br> Here, take the whole bottle.<br> Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br> Captain Butler.<br> This sure is a happy day to me.<br> I done diapered three generations<br> of this family's girls...<br> ...and it sure is a happy day.<br> Oh, yes, Mammy.<br> The happiest days are when babies come.<br> I wish....<br> Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br> What do you suppose they'll name her?<br> Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl...<br> ...she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.<br> Yes...<br> ...she's a beautiful baby...<br> ...the most beautiful baby ever.<br> Yes.<br> Do you know that this is your birthday?<br> That you're a week old today?<br> Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br> of which this town has never seen.<br> Yes, I'm gonna send her<br> to the best schools in Charleston.<br> Yes. And her'll be received<br> by the best families in the South.<br> And when it comes time for her to marry...<br> ...well, she'll be a little princess.<br> You certainly are making a fool of yourself.<br> And why shouldn't l?<br> She's the first person<br> who's ever completely belonged to me.<br> Great balls of fire!<br> I had the baby, didn't l?<br> It's Melanie. May I come in?<br> Come in, Melly.<br> Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br> beautiful blue eyes.<br> But, Captain Butler, most babies have<br> blue eyes when they're born.<br> Don't try to tell him anything.<br> He knows everything about babies.<br> Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br> and they're going to stay blue.<br> As blue as the bonnie blue flag.<br> That's it. That's what we'll call her.<br> Bonnie Blue Butler.<br> Try again, Mammy.<br> Twenty inches.<br> Twenty inches!<br> I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.<br> You've simply got to make it<br> You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...<br> ...and you ain't never goin' to be<br> no 18 and a half inches again.<br> Never. And there ain't nothin'<br> to do about it.<br> There is something to do about it!<br> I'm just not going to get old and fat<br> before my time.<br> I just won't have any more babies!<br> I heard Mr. Rhett say<br> that he'll be wantin' a son next year.<br> Go tell Captain Butler<br> I've decided not to go out after all.<br> I'll have supper in my room.<br> I got your message.<br> I'll have them bring my supper up here too.<br> No objections to that, I hope?<br> No.<br> Yes.<br> I mean, I don't care<br> where you have your supper.<br> Rhett?<br> Yes?<br> You see...<br> ...well, I've decided...<br> ...well, I hope I don't have<br> any more children.<br> My pet, as I told you<br> before Bonnie was born...<br> ...it's immaterial to me<br> whether you have one child or 20!<br> No, but you know what l....<br> Do you know what I mean?<br> I do. And do you know<br> I can divorce you for this?<br> You're just low enough<br> to think of something like that!<br> If you had any chivalry in you or would<br> be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes!<br> Melanie can't have any more children<br> and he....<br> You've been to the lumber office<br> this afternoon, haven't you?<br> What has that got to do with it?<br> Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br> Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.<br> It's no use. You wouldn't understand.<br> You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.<br> Sorry for me?<br> Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing<br> away happiness with both hands...<br> ...and reaching out for something<br> that will never make you happy.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> If you were free and Miss Melly were dead<br> and you had your precious...<br> ...honorable Ashley, do you think<br> you'd be happy with him?<br> You'd never know him,<br> never even understand his mind...<br> ...any more than you understand anything<br> except money.<br> Never mind about that!<br> What I want to know is--<br> You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br> It'll work no hardship on me.<br> Do you mean to say you don't care?<br> The world is full of many things<br> and many people, and I shan't be lonely.<br> I'll find comfort elsewhere.<br> Well, that's fine. But I warn you.<br> Just in case you change your mind,<br> I intend to lock my door.<br> Why bother? lf I wanted to come in,<br> no lock could keep me out!<br> I always knew that most women<br> were cheats, hypocritical and hard.<br> -But this one....<br> -Rhett, it ain't no use.<br> -What do you mean?<br> -I mean you're poisoned with her.<br> I don't care what she's done to you,<br> you're still in love with her.<br> And don't think it pleasures me none<br> to say it.<br> Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br> I tell you! I'm through.<br> You gotta think of the child.<br> The child's worth ten of the mother.<br> You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br> and a very nice one.<br> Yes, Rhett?<br> I was just thinking of the difference<br> between you, and...<br> ...you're both hard-headed business women<br> and you're both successful.<br> But you've got a heart, Belle...<br> ...and you're honest.<br> Goodbye, Rhett.<br> Goodbye, Belle.<br> She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!<br> Look at those hands, and that seat!<br> Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!<br> Just why we have to wheel the baby<br> when we have a house full of servants....<br> Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.<br> Good morning, Captain Butler.<br> Good morning, Scarlett.<br> Making fools of ourselves<br> in front of these old buffaloes!<br> If you'd thought of your position years ago,<br> you wouldn't have to do this.<br> But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br> dragon of the old guard in this town.<br> Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.<br> Good morning, Captain Butler.<br> Good morning, Scarlett.<br> So the millionaire speculator's<br> turning respectable!<br> All of our money can't buy<br> what I want for Bonnie.<br> Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.<br> But Bonnie's going to have a place<br> among decent people.<br> Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br> on our bellies to every fat old cat.<br> Good morning, Mrs. Meade.<br> Good morning, Captain Butler.<br> Good morning, Scarlett.<br> Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br> a great regard for your knowledge.<br> I wonder if you could give me some advice.<br> Why, certainly, Captain Butler.<br> My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br> I can't make her stop it.<br> You should make her stop it.<br> It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.<br> I know, I know.<br> She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br> I tried putting soap under her nails.<br> Soap! Bah!<br> Put quinine on her thumb<br> and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.<br> Quinine! I never would have thought of it.<br> I can't thank you enough,<br> Mrs. Merriwether.<br> You've taken a great load off my mind!<br> Good morning.<br> Good morning, Dolly.<br> Wasn't that Captain Butler?<br> Good morning, Caroline.<br> I was just thinking.<br> There must be a great deal of good<br> in a man who could love a child so much.<br> But of course there is!<br> Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br> told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler...<br> ...finally admitted he was honored<br> by the Confederate Congress...<br> ...for his services at the Battle of Franklin?<br> No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br> that Captain Butler...<br> ...made a stupendous contribution<br> to the Association for the Beautification...<br> ...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?<br> No!<br> My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br> is giving a party for Bonnie next week.<br> Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br> you know right well it was my idea...<br> ...to give a party for Bonnie Butler!<br> Why Caroline Meade....<br> Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br> Bonnie. Now watch.<br> Daddy, let me! Let me!<br> All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!<br> Up we go.<br> Oh, there!<br> Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!<br> Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.<br> Lean forward and be sure you go with him.<br> Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br> Up!<br> That was fine! I knew you'd do it!<br> When you get a little older,<br> I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.<br> You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br> in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.<br> Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!<br> Mr. Rhett!<br> Did you see her, Mammy?<br> Wasn't she wonderful?<br> Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br> it just ain't fittin'...<br> ...for a girl child to ride astraddle<br> with her dress flyin' up!<br> All right, Mammy.<br> I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.<br> And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br> She'll love that.<br> A nice black broadcloth is<br> what little girls wear.<br> Now, Mammy, be reasonable.<br> Well, I don't think it's fittin', but....<br> It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.<br> It ain't fittin'.<br> Why, Scarlett!<br> What are you doing downtown<br> at this time of day?<br> Ashley, I just--<br> Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br> for my surprise birthday party?<br> Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br> to know anything about that.<br> Melly'd be so disappointed<br> if you weren't surprised.<br> I won't let on.<br> I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.<br> As long as you're here,<br> let me show you the books...<br> ...so you can see just how bad<br> a businessman I really am.<br> Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.<br> When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br> all the figures I ever knew...<br> ...go right slap out of my head.<br> The figures are well lost<br> when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.<br> Scarlett, you know,<br> you get prettier all the time.<br> You haven't changed a bit since the day<br> of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...<br> ...where you sat under a tree<br> surrounded by dozens of beaux.<br> That girl doesn't exist anymore.<br> Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.<br> Nothing.<br> Yes, we've travelled a long road<br> since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?<br> Oh, the lazy days...<br> ...the warm, still country twilights...<br> ...the high, soft negro laughter<br> from the quarters...<br> ...the golden warmth and security<br> of those days.<br> Don't look back, Ashley.<br> Don't look back.<br> It drags at your heart<br> till you can't do anything, but look back.<br> I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.<br> I'd never want you to be anything<br> but completely happy.<br> Oh, Ashley!<br> Who is it?<br> Only your husband.<br> Come in.<br> Am I actually being invited<br> into the sanctuary?<br> You're not ready for Melanie's party.<br> I've got a headache, Rhett.<br> You go without me,<br> and make my excuses to Melanie.<br> What a white-livered little coward you are!<br> Get up!<br> You're going to that party<br> and you'll have to hurry.<br> -Has lndia dared to--<br> -Yes. India has!<br> Every woman and man in town<br> knows the story!<br> You should kill them, spreading lies.<br> I have a strange way of not killing people<br> who tell the truth.<br> There's no time to argue now. Get up!<br> I won't go! I can't go<br> until this misunderstanding is cleared up.<br> You won't cheat Miss Melly<br> out of the satisfaction of publicly...<br> ...ordering you out of her house.<br> There was nothing wrong.<br> India hates me so.<br> I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.<br> If you don't show it tonight,<br> you'll never be able to as long as you live.<br> While that wouldn't bother me,<br> you're ruining Bonnie's chances.<br> You're going to that party,<br> if only for her sake. Now, get dressed!<br> Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br> will do for this occasion.<br> And put on plenty of rouge.<br> I want you to look your part tonight.<br> "For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> "For he's a jolly good fellow<br> Which nobody can deny<br> "Which nobody can deny<br> Which nobody can deny<br> "For he's a jolly good fellow...."<br> -Good night, Scarlett.<br> -But Rhett, you can't--<br> You go into the arena alone.<br> The lions are hungry for you.<br> Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.<br> You're not afraid?<br> "Which nobody can deny<br> Which nobody can deny<br> "For he's a jolly good fellow<br> For he's a jolly good fellow<br> "For he's a jolly good fellow<br> Which nobody can deny."<br> What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.<br> India wasn't able to come tonight.<br> Will you be an angel?<br> I do need you to help me<br> receive my guests.<br> Mrs. Meade...<br> ...here's our darling Scarlett.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> Why Scarlett!<br> -Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br> -Good evening, Mrs. Butler.<br> Ashley, aren't you going to get<br> our Scarlett a glass of punch?<br> Did you have a good time tonight<br> at Miss Melly's party, child?<br> Yes, yes.<br> Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word...<br> ...if Captain Butler asks for me<br> when he comes back, I'm asleep.<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> Come in, Mrs. Butler.<br> Come here.<br> Sit down!<br> There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br> your nightcap even if I am here.<br> I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and--<br> You heard nothing of the kind.<br> You wouldn't have come down<br> if you'd thought I was here.<br> -You must need a drink badly.<br> -I do not!<br> Take it. Don't give yourself airs.<br> I know you drink on the quiet,<br> and I know how much you drink.<br> Do you think I care if you like your brandy?<br> You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!<br> I'm very drunk...<br> ...and I intend getting still drunker<br> before the evening's over...<br> ...but you're not going to bed, not yet!<br> Sit down!<br> So she stood by you, did she?<br> How does it feel to have the woman<br> you've wronged cloak your sins for you?<br> You're wondering if she knows<br> all about you and Ashley.<br> You're wondering if she did it<br> just to save her face.<br> You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it<br> even if it did save your hide.<br> -I will not listen.<br> -Yes, you'll listen!<br> Miss Melly's a fool,<br> but not the kind you think.<br> It's just that there's too much honor in her<br> to ever conceive of dishonor...<br> ...in anyone she loves.<br> And she loves you.<br> Though just why she does,<br> I'm sure I don't know!<br> If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br> I could explain everything.<br> -As it is though--<br> -If you get out of that chair once more!<br> Of course, the comic figure in all this is<br> the long suffering Mr. Wilkes!<br> Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br> mentally faithful to his wife...<br> ...and won't be unfaithful to her technically.<br> Why doesn't he make up his mind?<br> Rhett, you....<br> Observe my hands, my dear.<br> I could tear you to pieces with them.<br> And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br> out of your mind forever.<br> But it wouldn't.<br> So I'll remove him<br> from your mind forever this way.<br> I'll put my hands so...<br> ...one on each side of your head...<br> ...and I'll smash your skull between them<br> like a walnut.<br> And that'll block him out.<br> Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.<br> You know I've always admired<br> your spirit, my dear.<br> Never more than now,<br> when you're cornered.<br> I'm not cornered.<br> And you'll never corner me,<br> Rhett Butler, or frighten me!<br> You've lived in dirt so long,<br> you can't understand anything else.<br> And you're jealous of something<br> you can't understand. Good night!<br> Jealous, am l?<br> Yes, I suppose I am.<br> Even though I know you've been faithful<br> to me all along.<br> How do I know?<br> Because I know Ashley Wilkes,<br> and his honorable breed.<br> They're gentlemen!<br> And that's more than I can say<br> for you or for me!<br> We're not gentlemen,<br> and we have no honor, have we?<br> It's not that easy, Scarlett.<br> You turned me out<br> while you chased Ashley Wilkes.<br> While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.<br> This is one night<br> you're not turning me out!<br> How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?<br> Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.<br> You actin' mighty happy this mornin',<br> Miss Scarlett.<br> I am, Mammy. I am.<br> "Oh, she wept with delight<br> when he gave her a smile<br> "And trembled with fear at his frown."<br> Hello.<br> I'd like to extend my apologies<br> for my conduct of last night.<br> Oh, but Rhett....<br> I was very drunk...<br> ...and quite swept off my feet<br> by your charms.<br> Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br> Nothing you ever do surprises me!<br> I've been thinking things over,<br> and I really believe that...<br> ...it would be better for both of us...<br> ...if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br> and got a divorce.<br> -A divorce?<br> -Yes.<br> There's no point in our holding on<br> to each other, is there?<br> I'll provide for you amply.<br> You've plenty of grounds.<br> Just give me Bonnie. You can say<br> what you please, I won't contest it.<br> Thank you very much.<br> But I wouldn't dream of disgracing<br> the family with a divorce.<br> You'd disgrace it quick enough<br> if Ashley were free.<br> It makes my head spin to think<br> how quickly you'd divorce me.<br> Wouldn't you, Scarlett?<br> Well, answer me.<br> Wouldn't you?<br> Will you please go now,<br> and leave me alone?<br> Yes, I'm going.<br> That's what I came to tell you.<br> I'm going on a very extended trip<br> to London, and I'm leaving today.<br> And I'm taking Bonnie with me.<br> So you'll please get<br> her little duds packed right away.<br> You'll never take my child<br> out of this house.<br> She's my child, too, Scarlett.<br> You're making a mistake,<br> if you think I'm leaving her here...<br> ...with a mother who hasn't the decency<br> to consider her own reputation.<br> You're a fine one to talk.<br> You think I'll let that child out<br> of this house...<br> ...when you'll probably have her around<br> with people like that Belle?<br> If you were a man<br> I'd break your neck for that.<br> As it is, I'll thank you<br> to shut your stupid mouth.<br> As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br> about your motherhood....<br> Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.<br> Have her things packed and ready<br> for me in an hour, or I warn you....<br> I've always thought a good lashing with a<br> buggy whip would benefit you immensely.<br> Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.<br> Hello, Uncle Rhett.<br> Hello, hello, Beau.<br> Daddy, Daddy!<br> Where have you been?<br> I've been waiting for you all morning.<br> Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br> to wrap my little Bonnie in.<br> Give your best sweetheart a kiss.<br> I'm going to take you<br> on a long trip to fairyland!<br> Where? Where?<br> I'm going to show you the Tower<br> of London, where the little princes were...<br> ...and London Bridge.<br> London Bridge!<br> Will it be falling down?<br> Well, it will if you want it to, darling.<br> Daddy, dark!<br> Dark!<br> Daddy! Dark!<br> It's all right.<br> Who put out that light? Nurse!<br> Daddy, dark!<br> Daddy, dark!<br> There. Yes, yes.<br> What's the matter with my Bonnie?<br> A bear.<br> Oh, a bear? A big bear?<br> Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.<br> Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br> if he comes back.<br> Good evening, Mr. Butler.<br> Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br> in the dark?<br> If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br> afraid of the dark, but they get over it.<br> If you just let her scream<br> for a night or two.<br> Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br> the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!<br> Of course, sir, if you want her<br> to grow up nervous and cowardly.<br> Cowardly!<br> There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br> You're discharged!<br> As you say, sir.<br> Where is Mother?<br> Aren't you happy here in London with me?<br> I want to go home.<br> Miss Bonnie!<br> And Captain Butler!<br> -Miss Scarlett!<br> -Hello, Mammy.<br> Honey, child!<br> Miss Scarlett! They's back!<br> They's back, Miss Scarlett!<br> Bonnie!<br> Bonnie! Bonnie, baby!<br> Darling, baby!<br> Are you glad to be home?<br> Daddy gave me a kitten.<br> -What a little, lovely kitten!<br> -London's a horrid place.<br> -Oh, my darling.<br> -Where's my pony?<br> -I want to go out and see my pony.<br> -You go out and see your pony.<br> Where's my pony?<br> I wanna go out and see my pony.<br> You run along with Mammy.<br> -Come on, honey child.<br> -Go with Mammy.<br> Mammy sure has missed you, honey.<br> Mrs. Butler, I believe.<br> Mammy said you'd come back.<br> But only to bring Bonnie.<br> Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br> is better for a child than none.<br> You mean you're going away again?<br> What perception, Mrs. Butler.<br> Right away.<br> In fact, I left my bags at the station.<br> You're looking pale.<br> Is there a shortage of rouge?<br> Or can this wanness mean<br> you've been missing me?<br> If I'm pale, it's your fault.<br> Not because I've been missing you,<br> but because....<br> Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.<br> It's because I'm going to have a baby.<br> Indeed?<br> And who's the happy father?<br> You know it's yours.<br> I don't want it any more than you do.<br> No woman would want the child<br> of a cad like you.<br> I wish it were anybody's child but yours.<br> Well, cheer up.<br> Maybe you'll have an accident.<br> Is she better?<br> Has she asked for me?<br> Don't you understand? She's delirious.<br> Rhett!<br> I want Rhett!<br> What's the matter, honey?<br> Did you call somebody, child?<br> It's no use.<br> It's no use.<br> Dr. Meade's left.<br> Scarlett's dead!<br> Oh, no, she's much better.<br> Really she is.<br> There, there, Captain Butler.<br> You're beside yourself.<br> She'll very soon be well again,<br> I promise you.<br> No, you don't understand.<br> She never wanted this baby.<br> Not want a baby?<br> Why, every woman wants a baby!<br> Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br> Not my children.<br> She told me she didn't want<br> any more children...<br> ...and I wanted to hurt her<br> because she'd hurt me.<br> I wanted to and I did.<br> Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br> It's not fit.<br> I didn't know about this baby<br> until the other day when she fell.<br> If I'd known, I'd have come straight home<br> whether she wanted me or not!<br> Well, of course you would.<br> And then when she told me,<br> there on the steps, what did I do?<br> What did I say? I laughed and I said--<br> But you didn't mean it.<br> I know you didn't mean it.<br> Oh, but I did mean it.<br> I was crazy with jealousy.<br> She's never cared for me. I thought I could<br> make her care, but I couldn't.<br> You're so wrong.<br> Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br> much more than she knows.<br> If that were only true I could wait forever.<br> If she'd only forgive me,<br> forget this ever happened.<br> She will.<br> You must be patient.<br> Oh, no, it's not possible.<br> You don't understand.<br> If you only knew who she really loved...<br> ...you wouldn't believe it.<br> Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.<br> No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.<br> There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br> and there can be other babies.<br> Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she<br> wanted to, after what she's been through.<br> But of course she could.<br> I'm going to.<br> No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br> It's too dangerous.<br> Children are life renewing itself,<br> Captain Butler...<br> ...and when life does that<br> danger seems very unimportant.<br> I've never before known anyone<br> who was really brave.<br> I pray God things go well with you,<br> Miss Melly.<br> And I want to thank you for all<br> you've done for me and for Scarlett.<br> From my heart, I thank you.<br> Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today,<br> Mr. Rhett.<br> Thank you, Mammy.<br> I've come to ask your forgiveness...<br> ...in the hope that we can give<br> our life together another chance.<br> Our life together?<br> When did we ever have a life together?<br> Yes, you're right.<br> But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br> we could be happy.<br> Well, what is there to make us happy now?<br> Well, there's Bonnie and...<br> ...and I love you, Scarlett.<br> When did you discover that?<br> I've always loved you, but you've never<br> given me a chance to show it.<br> Well, and just what do you want me to do?<br> To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.<br> We'll go away.<br> We'll take Bonnie and we'll have<br> another honeymoon.<br> Give up the mill? But why?<br> It's making more money than ever.<br> Yes, I know, but we don't need it.<br> Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.<br> Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.<br> Always Melanie!<br> lf you'd only think a little more about me....<br> I am thinking of you...<br> ...and I'm thinking that...<br> ...well, maybe it's the mill<br> that's taken you away from me...<br> ...and from Bonnie.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.<br> You're the one taking her away from me.<br> But she loves you.<br> You've done everything possible<br> to make her love you and not me.<br> Why, she's so spoiled now that--<br> Mommy! Daddy!<br> Watch me!<br> We're watching, darling.<br> You're mighty pretty, precious.<br> So are you.<br> I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.<br> I don't think you ought to do<br> much jumping yet, Bonnie.<br> Remember, you've just learned<br> to ride sidesaddle.<br> I will so jump!<br> I can jump better than ever<br> 'cause I've grown...<br> ...and I've moved the bar higher.<br> Don't let her do it, Rhett.<br> No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br> don't cry and blame me.<br> Rhett, stop her!<br> Bonnie!<br> Bonnie!<br> Just like Pa.<br> Just like Pa!<br> Bonnie!<br> Bonnie!<br> Bonnie!<br> Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br> I sure is glad you has come.<br> This house won't seem<br> the same without Bonnie.<br> How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?<br> Miss Melly, this here done<br> broke her heart...<br> ...but I didn't fetch you here<br> on Miss Scarlett's account.<br> What that child got to stand,<br> the good Lord give her strength to stand.<br> It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.<br> He done lost his mind<br> these last couple of days.<br> No, Mammy, no.<br> I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br> set such store on any child.<br> When Dr. Meade says her neck broke...<br> ...Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br> and shoot that poor pony...<br> ...and for a minute I think<br> he going to shoot hisself.<br> Oh, poor Captain Butler.<br> Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br> a murderer for teachin' that child to jump.<br> She say, "You give me my baby<br> what you kill."<br> And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br> never cared nothin' about Miss Bonnie.<br> It like to turn my blood cold,<br> the things they say to one another.<br> Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.<br> And then that night...<br> ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br> in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...<br> ...and he wouldn't even open the door...<br> ...when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br> and hollered to him.<br> And that's the way it's been<br> for two whole days.<br> Oh, Mammy.<br> And then this evenin',<br> Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door...<br> ...and she say the funeral set<br> for tomorrow mornin'...<br> ...and he says "You try that<br> and I kills you tomorrow.<br> "Do you think I's goin'<br> to put my child away in the...<br> "...in the dark when she's so scared of it?"<br> Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.<br> Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br> He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.<br> You gotta help us, Miss Melly.<br> Oh, but I can't intrude.<br> If you can't help us, who can?<br> Mr. Rhett always set great store<br> by your opinion.<br> Please, Miss Melly.<br> I'll do what I can, Mammy.<br> Get away from that door,<br> and leave us alone.<br> It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.<br> Please let me in.<br> I've come to see Bonnie.<br> Oh, Lord...<br> ...please help Mr. Rhett<br> in this hour of his grief.<br> I want you to go and make<br> a good deal of strong coffee...<br> ...and bring it up to Captain Butler.<br> I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.<br> But....<br> Captain Butler is quite willing<br> for the funeral to take place...<br> ...tomorrow morning.<br> Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br> on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.<br> Miss Melly! Miss Melly!<br> Miss Melly!<br> Miss Melly! Miss Melly!<br> Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...<br> ...and try...<br> ...try to get me home.<br> Miss Melly! Miss Melly!<br> Where is my mother goin' away to?<br> And why can't I go along, please?<br> We can't always go along, Beau,<br> much as we may want to.<br> You're going back to bed now.<br> Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!<br> She hasn't your strength.<br> She's never had any strength.<br> She's never had anything but heart.<br> You knew that, too.<br> Why do I have to go back to bed?<br> It's morning.<br> It isn't really morning yet.<br> You may come in now, Scarlett.<br> Dr. Meade, please let me see her!<br> I've been waiting here two whole days<br> and I've got to tell her...<br> ...that I was wrong about something.<br> She knows you were wrong.<br> She wants to see Scarlett.<br> Miss Melly's going to die in peace.<br> I won't have you easing your conscience<br> telling her things...<br> ...that make no difference now.<br> You understand?<br> It's me, Melly.<br> Promise me?<br> Anything.<br> Look after my little son.<br> I gave him to you once before.<br> Remember?<br> The day he was born.<br> Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br> I know you'll get well.<br> Promise me...<br> ...college....<br> Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br> whatever he wants. But...<br> ...Melly, do try....<br> Ashley....<br> Ashley and you.<br> What about Ashley, Melly?<br> Look after him for me.<br> Just as you...<br> ...looked after me for him.<br> I will, Melly.<br> Look after him...<br> ...but never let him know.<br> Good night.<br> Promise?<br> What else, Melly?<br> Captain Butler...<br> ...be kind to him.<br> Rhett?<br> He loves you so.<br> Yes, Melly.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> You ladies may come in now.<br> Ashley.<br> I don't know where the mate to this is.<br> She must have put it away.<br> Oh, stop it.<br> Hold me.<br> I'm so frightened.<br> I'm so frightened.<br> Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br> I can't live without her, I can't.<br> Everything I ever had is...<br> ...is going with her.<br> Oh, Ashley.<br> You really love her, don't you?<br> She's the only dream I ever had<br> that didn't die in the face of reality.<br> Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br> never common sense.<br> Oh, Scarlett!<br> lf you knew what I've gone through!<br> Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br> that you loved her and not me...<br> ...and not left me dangling<br> with your talk of honor.<br> But you had to wait till now,<br> now when Melly's dying...<br> ...to show me that I could never mean<br> any more to you than...<br> ...than this Watling woman does to Rhett.<br> And I've loved something that...<br> ...that doesn't really exist.<br> Somehow...<br> ...l don't care.<br> Somehow it doesn't matter.<br> It doesn't matter one bit.<br> Ashley, forgive me.<br> Don't cry.<br> She mustn't see you've been crying.<br> Ashley!<br> Melly!<br> Melly!<br> Rhett, Rhett!<br> Rhett, where are you?<br> Rhett, wait for me.<br> Rhett, wait for me!<br> Rhett.<br> Come in.<br> Rhett....<br> Melanie, she's....<br> Well, God rest her.<br> She was the only completely kind person<br> I ever knew.<br> A great lady.<br> A very great lady.<br> So she's dead.<br> That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?<br> Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br> You know how I loved her, really!<br> No, I don't know that I do.<br> But at least it's to your credit<br> that you could appreciate her at the end.<br> Of course I appreciated her.<br> She thought of everybody except herself.<br> Why her last words were about you.<br> What did she say?<br> She said:<br> "Be kind to Captain Butler.<br> He loves you so."<br> Did she say anything else?<br> She said...<br> ...she asked me to look after Ashley, too.<br> It's convenient to have<br> the first wife's permission, isn't it?<br> What do you mean?<br> What are you doing?<br> I'm leaving you, my dear.<br> All you need now is a divorce,<br> and your dreams of Ashley can come true.<br> Oh, no!<br> No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!<br> I don't want a divorce.<br> Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...<br> ...when I knew I loved you,<br> I ran home to tell you.<br> Oh, darling, darling....<br> Please don't go on with this.<br> Leave us some dignity to remember<br> out of our marriage. Spare us this last.<br> This last?<br> Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.<br> I must have loved you for years, only I was<br> such a stupid fool I didn't know it.<br> Please believe me. You must care.<br> Melly said you did.<br> I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?<br> I never really loved Ashley.<br> You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br> up till this morning.<br> No, Scarlett. I tried everything.<br> If you'd only met me half way,<br> even when I came back from London.<br> I was so glad to see you.<br> I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.<br> And then, when you were sick<br> and it was all my fault...<br> ...l hoped against hope<br> that you'd call for me, but you didn't.<br> I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br> but I didn't think you wanted me.<br> It seems we've been at cross purposes,<br> doesn't it? But it's no use now.<br> As long as there was Bonnie,<br> there was a chance we might be happy.<br> I liked to think that Bonnie was you.<br> A little girl again, before the war,<br> and poverty had done things to you.<br> She was so like you, and I could pet her,<br> and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.<br> But when she went, she took everything.<br> Oh, Rhett!<br> Rhett, please don't say that.<br> I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.<br> My darling, you're such a child.<br> You think that by saying, "l'm sorry,"<br> all the past can be corrected.<br> Here, take my handkerchief.<br> Never, at any crisis of your life,<br> have I known you to have a handkerchief.<br> Rhett, where are you going?<br> I'm going to Charleston.<br> Back where I belong.<br> Please. Please take me with you.<br> No. I'm through with everything here.<br> I want peace.<br> I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br> something left in life of charm and grace.<br> -Do you know what I'm talking about?<br> -No. I only know that I love you.<br> That's your misfortune.<br> Oh, Rhett.<br> Rhett!<br> Rhett!<br> If you go, where shall I go?<br> What shall I do?<br> Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.<br> Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!<br> There must be some way<br> to bring him back.<br> I can't think about it now.<br> I'll go crazy if I do!<br> I'll think about it tomorrow.<br> But I must think about it.<br> I must think about it.<br> What is there to do?<br> What is there that matters?<br> Do you mean to tell me,<br> Katie Scarlett O'Hara...<br> ...that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?<br> Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br> It's the only thing that lasts.<br> Something you love better than me,<br> though you may not know it. Tara.<br> It's this from which you get your strength.<br> The red earth of Tara.<br> Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br> It's the only thing that lasts.<br> Something you love better than me,<br> though you may not know it. Tara.<br> This from which you get your strength.<br> The red earth of Tara.<br> Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br> Something you love better than me.<br> The red earth of Tara.<br> -Tara!<br> -Tara!<br> Tara!<br> Home!<br> I'll go home!<br> And I'll think of some way to get him back.<br> After all...<br> ...tomorrow...<br> ... is another day!<br> =DS= 2005<br>
