What class?<br> - History.|- Maybe.<br> Yes, I think|that's what it was.<br> You don't necessarily-- may not|remember me. You know, I like it here.<br> - It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,|I'm a genius. I am very smart.|- Hey.<br> - Hey, how's it goin'? How are ya?|- Good. How ya doin'?<br> What class|did you say that was?<br> - History.|- Yeah.<br> Just history? It must have been|a survey course then.<br> - Yeah, it was. It was surveys.|- Right.<br> You should check it out. It's a good|course. It'd be a good class.<br> - How'd you like that course?|- You know, frankly,<br> - I found that class, you know,|rather elementary.|- Elementary.<br> - You know, I don't doubt that it was.|- Yeah.<br> I, uh,|I remember that class.<br> It was, um--|It was just between recess and lunch.<br> Clark, why don't you|go away?<br> - Why don't you relax?|- Why don't you go away?<br> -I'm just havin' fun with my new friend.|-Are we gonna have a problem?<br> No, no, no, no.|There's no problem here.<br> I was just hoping you might give me|some insight into the evolution...<br> of the market economy|in the southern colonies.<br> My contention is that|prior to the Revolutionary War,|the economic modalities--<br> especially|in the southern colonies--<br> could most aptly|be characterized as...<br> - agrarian precapitalist.|- Let me tell you somethin'.<br> Of course that's your contention.|You're a first-year grad student.<br> You just got finished readin'|some Marxian historian--|Pete Garrison, probably--<br> You're gonna be convinced of that till|next month when you get to James Lemon.<br> Then you're gonna be talkin'|about how the economies|of Virginia and Pennsylvania...<br> were entrepreneurial|and capitalist way back in 1740.<br> That's gonna last until|next year. You're gonna be in|here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood,<br> talkin' about, you know,|the prerevolutionary utopia...<br> and the capital-forming effects|of military mobilization.<br> Well,|as a matter of fact, I won't,<br> because Wood drastically|underestimates the impact of--<br> Wood drastically underestimates|the impact of social distinctions...<br> predicated upon wealth,|especially inherited wealth.<br> You got that from Vickers'|Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?<br> I read that too. Were you gonna|plagiarize the whole thing for us?<br> Do you have any thoughts|of your own on this matter?<br> Or is that your thing? You come into|a bar. You read some obscure passage.<br> Then pretend--|pawn it off as your own.<br> As your own idea just to impress|some girls? Embarrass my friend?<br> See, the sad thing about a guy like|you is, in 50 years,<br> you're gonna start doin'|some thinkin' on your own.<br> You're gonna come up with the fact that|there are two certainties in life.<br> One: Don't do that.<br> And two: You dropped 150 grand|on a fuckin' education...<br> you could've got for $1.50|in late charges at the public library.<br> Yeah, but|I will have a degree,<br> and you'll be servin' my kids|fries at a drive through|on our way to a skiing trip.<br> Maybe, but at least|I won't be unoriginal.<br> If you have a problem with that,|we could step outside.|We could figure it out.<br> No, man, there's no problem.|It's cool.<br> - It's cool?|- Yeah.<br> - Cool.|- Damn right, it's cool.<br> How do you like me now?<br> My boy's wicked smart.<br> I just spent three minutes|in this fuckin' place|and run into a barney, huh?<br> There it is.<br> - Nice to meet you.|- They were fine, man.<br> I was gonna close the deal, but then|Chuck-- Billy insulted one of 'em--<br> The heavyset girl said I had|a receding hairline, and I was|a few pounds overweight.<br> And I was, like,|"Go fuck yourself."<br> I swallowed a bug.<br> Hi.<br> - You're an idiot.|- What?<br> You're an idiot. I've been sitting|over there for 45 minutes...<br> waiting for you|to come and talk to me.<br> But I'm tired now,|and I have to go home.<br> I couldn't sit there anymore|waiting for you.<br> - I'm Will.|- Skylar.<br> - Skylar.|- Oh, and by the way,<br> that guy over there--|Michael Bolton clone--<br> He wasn't sitting with us,|so to speak.<br> - I know. I kinda got that impression.|- Good. Okay.<br> Well, I've got to go.<br> Gotta get up early and waste some more|money on my overpriced education.<br> - No, I didn't mean you.|- That's all right.<br> There's my number. Maybe we can|go out for coffee sometime.<br> All right, yeah. Maybe we can just get|together and eat a bunch of caramels.<br> - What do you mean?|- When you think about it,<br> - it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.|- Oh. Yeah. Okay.<br> Uh, right, then.<br> Oh, come on. You're kidding.<br> Yo!<br> - Fuck you, bitch!|- Fuck you.<br> - There goes them fuckin' barneys|right now with his skiin' trip.|- Hold on.<br> We should've beat|that old bitch's ass.<br> Do you like apples?<br> - Yeah.|- Yeah?<br> Well, I got her number!|How do you like them apples?<br> # We arrived tonight #<br> # The miles were over me #<br> # I turned off the light #<br> # So, come on, night #<br> # Everyone who's gone #<br> # Home to oblivion #<br> # So come home #<br> # So come on by ##<br> Come.<br> Excuse me?

I'll do the math,|but I'm not gonna meet|with any fuckin' therapist.<br> It's better than spending|that time in jail, isn't it?<br> I read your book, and "Mike"|was havin' the same problems...<br> that "Chad," the stockbroker,|was havin'.<br> Absolutely right. Right on the button.|Good for you, Will.<br> - Very nice.|- Thank you.<br> Will, the pressures--|and I'm not judging them.<br> I'm not labeling them,<br> but they are destroying|your potential.<br> No more shenanigans.|No more tomfoolery.

Nail 'em|while they're vulnerable.<br> That's my motto.<br> Oh, good, everyone's back.|Welcome back, everybody.<br> - Hello, Sean.|- Hey, Gerry.<br> Um, ladies and gentlemen,|we are in the presence of greatness.<br> Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal|winner for combinatorial mathematics.<br> - Hello.|- Anyone know what|the Field's medal is?<br> It's a really big deal.|It's like the Nobel prize for math.<br> Except they only give it out once|every four years. It's a great thing.<br> It's an amazing honor.|Okay, everybody, that's it for today.<br> Thanks. We'll see you Monday.|We'll be talking about Freud.<br> Why he did enough cocaine|to kill a small horse.

You're a smoothie.|Come on, Morgan! Just submit!<br> Hey, Bill, just-just get off him.|We're gonna miss the game.<br> - I've got a full schedule.|I'm very busy.|- Sean, Sean.<br> This-This boy is incredible.|I've never seen anything like him.<br> What makes him|so incredible, Gerry?<br> - You ever heard of Ramanujan?|- Yeah, yeah. No.<br> It's a man. He lived|over 100 years ago. He was Indian.<br> - Dots, not feathers.|- Not feathers. Yeah.<br> He lived in this tiny hut|somewhere in India.<br> He had no formal education.<br> - He had no access|to any scientific work.|- Coffee?<br> - You, sir?|- Just a little.<br> But he came across|this old math book,<br> and from the simple text,|he was able to extrapolate theories...<br> that had baffled|mathematicians for years.<br> Yes. Continued fractions.|He wrote, uh--<br> - Well, he mailed it|to Hardy at Cambridge.|- Yeah, Cambridge. Yeah.<br> - And Hardy immediately recognized|the brilliance of his work...|- Mm-hmm.<br> and brought him over to England,|and then they worked together for years,<br> creating some of the most|exciting math theory ever done.<br> This-This Ramanujan--<br> his-his genius|was unparalleled, Sean.<br> - Well, this boy's just like that.|- Hmm.<br> - But he's-- he's a bit defensive.|- Hmm.<br> I need someone|who can get through to him.<br> - Like me?|- Yeah, like you.<br> - Why?|- Well, because you have|the same kind of background.<br> - What background?|- Well, you're from|the same neighborhood.<br> - He's from Southie?|- Yeah.<br> Boy genius from Southie.<br> - How many shrinks you go to before me?|- Five.<br> - Let me guess.|Barry? Henry? Not Rick?|- Yeah. Yeah.<br> - Sean, please, just meet|with him once a week.|- Mm-hmm.<br> Please?<br> It's a poker game with this kid.|Don't let him know what you've got.<br> He probably even read your book,|if he could find it.<br> It's gonna be hard|for him to find.<br> - Hi, Will.|- Hi.<br> This is Sean Maguire.|Will Hunting.<br> How are ya?<br> - Yeah. Let's get started.|- Yeah, let's do it.<br> I'm pumped.|Let's let the healing begin.<br> - Will you excuse us?|- Yeah, please, Tom.<br> You, too, Gerry.<br> Yeah, of course.<br> How are you?<br> Where you from|in Southie?<br> -l like what you've done with the place.|-Oh, thanks.<br> Do you buy all these books|retail,<br> or do you send away for, like,|a "shrink kit" that comes with|all these volumes included?<br> - Do you like books?|- Yeah.<br> - Did you read any of these books?|- I don't know.<br> - How about any of these books?|- Probably not.<br> What about the ones|on the top shelf? You read those?<br> - Yeah, I read those.|- Good for you. What do you|think about 'em?<br> I'm not here for a fuckin' book|report. They're your books.|Why don't you read 'em?<br> I did. I had to.<br> - Must've taken you a long time.|- Yeah, it did.<br> United States of America:|A Complete History, Volume l.<br> Jesus. If you wanna read|a real history book,<br> read Howard Zinn's|A People's History in the United States.<br> That book'll fuckin'|knock you on your ass.<br> Better than Chomsky's|Manufacturing Consent?<br> - Do you think that's a good book?|- You fuckin' people baffle me.<br> You spend all your money on|these fuckin' fancy books.|You surround yourselves with 'em.<br> - They're the wrong fuckin' books.|- What are the right|fuckin' books, Will?<br> - Whatever blows your hair back.|- Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.<br> Hey, you know you'd be better|shoving that cigarette up your ass.<br> - It'd probably be healthier for you.|- Yeah, I know.<br> - It really gets in the way of my yoga.|- You work out, huh?<br> - What, you lift?|- Yeah.<br> - Nautilus?|- No, free weights.<br> - Oh, really? Free weights, huh?|- Yeah. Yeah, big time.<br> - Yeah?|- Just like that.<br> - What do you bench?|- 285. What do you bench?<br> You paint that?<br> - Yeah. Do you paint?|- Uh-uh.<br> - Do you sculpt?|- No.<br> Do you like art?<br> - Do you like music?|- This is a real piece of shit.<br> Oh, tell me what|you really think.<br> Just the linear and impressionistic mix|makes a very muddled composition.<br> It's also a Winslow Homer|rip-off, except you got|whitey rowin' the boat there.<br> Well, it's art, Monet.|It wasn't very good.<br> - That's not really|what concerns me though.|- What concerns you?<br> -Just the coloring.|-You know what the real bitch of it is?<br> It's paint-by-number.<br> Is it color-by-number? Because|the colors are fascinating to me.<br> - Aren't they really?|- You bet.<br> I think you're about one step away|from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.<br> - Really?|- Oh, yeah.<br> Think I should move to the south of|France, change my name to "Vincent"?<br> - You ever heard the sayin',|"any port in a storm"?|- Yeah.<br> - Yeah, maybe that means you.|- In what way?<br> - Maybe you're in the middle|of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.|- Yeah, maybe.<br> The sky's fallin' on your head.|The waves are crashin'|over your little boat.<br> The oars are about to snap.<br> You just piss in your pants.|You're cryin' for the harbor.<br> So maybe you do|what you gotta do to get out.<br> You know, maybe you became|a psychologist.<br> Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.|You start with me. Come on.<br> - Maybe you married the wrong woman.|- Maybe you should watch your mouth!<br> Watch it right there, chief,|all right?<br> Ah.<br> That's it, isn't it?<br> You married|the wrong woman.<br> What happened?|What, did she leave you?<br> Was she, you know-- |banging some other guy?<br> If you ever disrespect my wife again,|I will end you.<br> I will fuckin' end you.<br> Got that, chief?<br> Time's up.<br> Yeah.<br> At ease, gentlemen.<br> You okay?<br> Look, I'll understand if you don't|wanna meet with him again.<br> Thursday, 4:00.|Make sure the kid's here.<br> Yeah.<br> Thanks.<br> Well, you look lovely|in those glasses.<br> - Thank you very much.|- They're just beautiful.<br> - Yes, I always wanted|dark blue eye shadow.|- Wonderful.<br> Growing up in England, you know,|I went to a very nice school.<br> You know, it was kind of progressive,|organic, do-it-yourself, private school.<br> Then Harvard.|Hopefully med school.<br> You know, I figured out,|by the end,<br> my brain's gonna be worth|$250,000.<br> That sounded horrible,|didn't it?<br> Bring me another mai tai!<br> Yeah, that's cool. I mean,|I bet your parents were happy to pay.<br> No, I was happy to pay.|I inherited the money.<br> Wow. Is Harvard gettin'|all that money?<br> No, Stanford. I'm going there|in June when I graduate.<br> All right, so you just wanted to use|this sailor and then run away, huh?<br> I was gonna, you know, experiment on you|for anatomy class first, obviously.<br> In that case, that's fine.<br> - Hey, you wanna see|my magic tricks, Skylar?|- Of course.<br> All right.|Promise to--<br> All right.<br> - This one's for you, Rudolph.|- Wait, wait. You need my wand.<br> All right, give me a hit.|Thank you. All right.<br> I'm gonna make|all these caramels disappear.<br> You ready?|Ready.<br> One, two, three.<br> They're all gone.<br> That was my-- It works better|when I have my rabbit.<br> Well--<br> I don't really date,|you know, that much.<br> How very unfortunate...|I think for me.<br> You know what I mean?|I know you've been thinking about it.<br> - Oh, no, I haven't.|- Yes, you have.<br> - No, I really haven't.|- Yes, you have. You were hoping|to get a good night kiss.<br> No, you know, I tell ya,|I was hopin' to get a good night laid.<br> But I'll settle for,|like, a kiss, you know?<br> - How very noble of you.|- Thank you.<br> - Mm.|- No, I was-- I was hopin' for a kiss.<br> Well, why don't we just|get it out of the way now?<br> - Right now?|- Yeah.<br> Come on.<br> I think I got|some of your pickle.<br> You again, huh?<br> Come with me.<br> So what's this?|A Taster's Choice moment between guys?<br> This is really nice. You got a thing|for swans? Is this, like, a fetish?<br> Is it something, like, maybe|we need to devote some time to?<br> - Thought about what you said to me|the other day. About my painting.|- Oh.<br> Stayed up half the night|thinking about it.<br> Something occurred to me.<br> I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep|and haven't thought about you since.<br> - You know what occurred to me?|- No.<br> You're just a kid. You don't have the|faintest idea what you're talking about.<br> - Why, thank you.|- It's all right.<br> You've never been|out of Boston.<br> Nope.<br> So if I asked you about art,|you'd probably give me the skinny...<br> on every art book|ever written.<br> Michelangelo?|You know a lot about him.<br> Life's work, political aspirations.|Him and the pope.<br> Sexual orientation.|The whole works, right?<br> I bet you can't tell me what it|smells like in the Sistine Chapel.<br> You never actually stood there|and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.<br> Seeing that.<br> If I ask you about women,<br> you'll probably give me a syllabus|of your personal favorites.<br> You may have even been laid|a few times.<br> But you can't tell me what it feels like|to wake up next to a woman...<br> and feel truly happy.<br> You're a tough kid.<br> I ask you about war, you'd probably|throw Shakespeare at me, right?<br> "Once more into the breach,|dear friends."<br> But you've never been near one.<br> You've never held your best friend's|head in your lap...<br> and watch him gasp his last|breath lookin' to you for help.<br> If I asked you about love,|you'd probably quote me a sonnet,<br> but you've never looked at a woman|and been totally vulnerable.<br> Known someone that could|level you with her eyes.<br> Feelin' like God put|an angel on Earth just for you,<br> who could rescue you|from the depths of hell.<br> And you wouldn't know|what it's like to be her angel,<br> to have that love for her|be there forever.<br> Through anything.|Through cancer.<br> And you wouldn't know about sleepin'|sittin' up in a hospital room...<br> for two months,|holding her hand,<br> because the doctors|could see in your eyes...<br> that the terms "visiting hours"|don't apply to you.<br> You don't know about real loss,<br> 'cause that only occurs when you love|something more than you love yourself.<br> I doubt you've ever dared|to love anybody that much.<br> I look at you. I don't see|an intelligent, confident man.<br> I see a cocky,|scared shitless kid.<br> But you're a genius, Will.|No one denies that.<br> No one could possibly understand|the depths of you.<br> But you presume to know everything about|me because you saw a painting of mine.<br> You ripped|my fuckin' life apart.<br> You're an orphan, right?<br> Do you think I'd know the first thing|about how hard your life has been--<br> how you feel, who you are--<br> because I read Oliver Twist?<br> Does that encapsulate you?<br> Personally, I don't give a shit|about all that, because--<br> You know what? I can't|learn anything from you...<br> I can't read|in some fuckin' book.<br> Unless you wanna talk|about you,<br> who you are.<br> And I'm fascinated.|I'm in.<br> But you don't wanna do that,|do you, sport?<br> You're terrified|of what you might say.<br> Your move, chief.<br> Hello? Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Professor Valenti,|are you calling me again?<br> Freak.<br> - Oh, God.|- Christ, who did you call?<br> - No one. I forgot the number.|- You fuckin' retarded?<br> You went all the way out there in the|rain, and you didn't bring the number.<br> No, it was your mother's 900 number.|I just ran out of quarters.<br> Why don't we get off on mothers?|I just got off yours.<br> That's|pretty funny, Morgan.<br> That's a fuckin' nickel,|bitch.<br> - Keep antagonizing me.|Watch what happens.|- All right, then, Morgan.<br> - Watch what happens.|- All right, then, Morgan.<br> Keep fuckin' with me.<br> No smoking.<br> What do you mean, he didn't talk?|You were in there for an hour.<br> He just sat there counting the seconds|until the session was over.<br> - Pretty impressive, actually.|- Why would he do that?<br> To prove to me he doesn't have|to talk to me if he doesn't want to.<br> What is this? Some kind of|staring contest between two kids|from the old neighborhood?<br> Yeah, it is,|and I can't talk first.<br> We know your theory, Alexander,|but the boy's found|a simple geometrical picture.<br> - A tree structure won't work.|- Look now.|He's joining the two vertices.<br> But I can do the sum.<br> - It's how you group|the terms, Alexander.|- But, Gerry.<br> If we do the whole thing|this way, then--<br> Hey, look, look.<br> I wrote it down.|It's simpler this way.<br> Sometimes|people get lucky.<br> You're a brilliant man.<br> You know,|I was on this plane once,<br> and I'm sittin' there, and...<br> the captain gets on,|he does his whole, you know,<br> "we'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet,"|but then he puts the mike down.<br> - He forgets to turn it off.|- Mm-hmm.<br> So he turns to the copilot.|He's, like,<br> "You know, all I could use right now is|a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee."<br> So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin'|up from the back of the plane...<br> to tell him|the microphone's still on.<br> This guy in the back|of the plane's like, "Hey, hon,|don't forget the coffee."<br> You ever been on a plane?<br> No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works|better if I tell it in the first person.<br> Yeah, it does.<br> I have been laid,|you know?<br> Really? Good for you.<br> - Big time, big time.|- Big time, huh?<br> I went on a date last week.<br> - How'd it go?|- It was good.<br> - Goin' out again?|- I don't know.<br> - Why?|- Haven't called her.<br> - Christ, you're an amateur.|- I know what I'm doin'.<br> Yeah. Don't worry about me.|I know what I'm doin'.<br> Yeah, but this girl was, like,|you know, beautiful.<br> She's smart. She's fun. She's different|from most of the girls I've been with.<br> - So call her up, Romeo.|- Why, so I can realize|she's not that smart.<br> That she's fuckin' boring?|You know, I mean, you don't--<br> This girl's, like, fuckin' perfect|right now. I don't wanna ruin that.<br> Maybe you're perfect right now.|Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.<br> But I think that's|a super philosophy, Will.<br> That way, you can go through|your entire life without ever|having to really know anybody.<br> My wife used to fart|when she was nervous.<br> She had all sorts|of wonderful idiosyncrasies.<br> You know, she used to fart|in her sleep.<br> Just thought I'd share that|with you.<br> One night it was so loud,|it woke the dog up.<br> She woke up and gone, like,|"Was that you?"<br> I said, "Yeah." I didn't have|the heart to tell her. Oh, God.<br> - She woke herself up?|- Yes.<br> Oh, Christ. But, Will,|she's been dead two years|and that's the shit I remember.<br> It's wonderful stuff, you know?|Little things like that.<br> Yeah, but those are the things|I miss the most.<br> Those little idiosyncrasies|that only I knew about.<br> That's what made her|my wife.<br> Boy, and she had the goods on me too.|She knew all my little peccadillos.<br> People call these things|"imperfections," but they're not.<br> That's the good stuff.<br> And then we get to choose who|we let into our weird little worlds.<br> You're not perfect, sport.<br> And let me save you|the suspense.<br> This girl you met,|she isn't perfect either.<br> But the question is whether or not|you're perfect for each other.<br> That's the whole deal.|That's what intimacy is all about.<br> Now you can know|everything in the world, sport,<br> but the only way you're findin' out|that one is by givin' it a shot.<br> You certainly won't learn|from an old fucker like me.<br> Even if I did know,|I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.<br> Yeah, why not?<br> You told me every other|fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.<br> Fuckin' talk more than any shrink|I ever seen in my life.<br> I teach the shit.|I didn't say I knew how to do it.<br> Yeah.<br> You ever think|about gettin' remarried?<br> My wife's dead.<br> - Hence the word "remarried."|- She's dead.<br> Yeah, well, I think|that's a super philosophy, Sean.<br> I mean, that way, you can actually|go through the rest of your life...<br> without ever really knowing|anybody.<br> Time's up.<br> - Hold it open.|- Okay.<br> Thanks.<br> # I am happy with you #<br> # I know I'm about|to love you #<br> # Yeah, yeah, yeah|You know him #<br> - # Oh, my, you made me-- ##<br> "G" minor seventh.|Saddest of all chords.<br> - Hello.|- Hey.<br> - Where have you been?|- I'm sorry.

'Cause the pain|I feel now?<br> Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't|regret a single day I spent with her.<br> So when did you know, like,|that she was the one for you?<br> October 21, 1975.<br> Jesus Christ.|You know the fuckin' day?<br> Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six|of the World Series, biggest|game in Red Sox history.<br> - Yeah, sure.|- My friends and I had slept out|all night to get tickets.<br> - You got tickets?|- Yep.

They saw it|in my eyes that I meant it.<br> - You're kiddin' me?|- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.<br> That's why I'm not talkin'|right now about some girl|I saw at a bar 20 years ago...<br> and how I always regretted|not goin' over and talkin' to her.<br> I don't regret the 18 years|I was married to Nancy.<br> I don't regret the six years I had|to give up counseling when she got sick,<br> and I don't regret the last years|when she got really sick.<br> And I sure as hell don't|regret missin' a damn game.<br> That's regret.<br> Wow!<br> Would have been nice|to catch that game though.<br> I didn't know Pudge|was gonna hit a home run.<br> You know, I'm very, very|useful on the court.<br> I'm extremely tall.<br> - You're not that tall.|- I dunk.<br> Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?<br> "It is decidedly so."|Hmph.<br> Why do we always stay here?<br> 'Cause it's nicer|than my place.<br> Yes, but I've never|seen your place.<br> I know.<br> When am I gonna meet|your friends and your brothers?<br> Well, they don't really|come down here that much.<br> I think I can make it|to South Boston.<br> It's kind of a hike.<br> Is it me you're hiding from them|or the other way around?<br> - All right, we'll go.|- When?<br> I don't know.|We'll go sometime next week.<br> What if I said I would not|sleep with you again until|you let me meet your friends?<br> I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.|They're probably up.<br> Oh, my God.|Men are shameless.<br> If you're not thinking|with your wiener, then you're|acting directly on its behalf.<br> You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,|can I get an advance payment?<br> I don't know. Let's ask.|"Outlook does not look good."<br> - What?|- Fuck the-- Hey, Chuck.|No. Nothing. Go back to sleep.<br> "Outlook"? That's the|same thing that told you|you was gonna play in the N.B.A.<br> Exactly, so look out. You'd better|start buying some season tickets.<br> Mmm! I plan to. I'm tall.|I like wearing shorts.<br> Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.<br> - You're not that tall.|- Yes, I am.<br> Maybe I'm all|about three points.<br> I'm all about home runs.<br> Stop mixing your|sporting metaphors.<br> A leprechaun's got his dick|in the monkey's ass.<br> Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',|"l don't mind it. I don't mind--"<br> Well, I can't believe you|brought Skylar here when we're|fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.<br> I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity|we'd be all drinkin'.<br> My uncle Marty drinks. He'll go|on a bender for six, eight months.<br> Did I ever tell ya what happened|to him when he was drivin'|up there and got pulled over?<br> - I told you guys, right?|- Marty, yeah.<br> Let me tell ya what happened to my uncle|Marty, because you oughta know this.<br> He's always tellin' stories. Every time|we come here he's got another story.<br> But we all heard this one.|Go ahead. Say it anyway.<br> I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.|Guess I have the floor now.<br> My uncle Marty's|drivin' home, right?<br> Bombed out of his tree, right? Just|hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked.<br> This state trooper sees him, pulls him|over. So my uncle's fucked basically.<br> Got him out of the car,|tryin' to make him walk the line.<br> He gets out of the car, pukes,|and the statie's pretty sure|he's over the legal limit.<br> So he's about to throw the cuffs|on him and put him in jail.<br> All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road,|there's this huge fuckin' boom.<br> - Statie gets real spooked.|He turns around--|- He got shot?<br> No. So-- So-- You|heard this story before.<br> Yeah, Morgan, stop.|Stop.<br> Some other guy's car had hit a tree.|There was an accident.<br> Anyway--<br> - How could he hear--|- Shut the fuck up!<br> - You're drivin' him nuts.|- I'm gonna break your neck. Shut up!<br> He told you the story|once before.<br> So he tells my uncle,|"Stay here. Don't move."<br> Statie goes runnin' down the road|to deal with the other accident.<br> After a few minutes of just|lyin' in his own piss and vomit,<br> my uncle starts wonderin'|what he's doin' there.<br> Gets up, gets in his car|and just drives home.<br> The next mornin'|my uncle's just passed out.<br> He hears this knockin' at the door.<br> So he goes downstairs,|pulls the door open-- "What?"<br> It's the state trooper|that pulled him over.<br> Statie says,|"Fuck you mean, 'What?'<br> You know what. I pulled you over|last night is what, and you took off."<br> He's like, "l never|seen you before in my life.<br> I've been home all night with my kids.|I don't know who the fuck you are."<br> He's like, "You know who I am.|Let me get in your garage."<br> My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You|heard me. Let me get in your garage."<br> He was like, "All right. Fine." Takes|him out to the garage, opens the door.<br> And there's-- The statie's police|cruiser is in my uncle's garage.<br> He was so fuckin'--<br> He was so fuckin' hammered|he drove the wrong car home.<br> The best part about it is,|the fuckin' state trooper...<br> was so embarrassed|he didn't do anything.<br> He'd been drivin' around all night in my|uncle's Chevelle, lookin' for the house.<br> All right, Chuck, what the fuck|is the point of your story?<br> He got away.|That's the point.<br> - Well, question--|- Come on. Stop.<br> - I'm tryin' to clarify somethin'.|- You're embarrassing him.<br> - It doesn't make any sense.|- It does make sense,<br> if you listen to the story|and quit askin' questions.<br> Well, let's see if you can get this one.|I've got a little story for you.<br> All right, there's an old couple|in bed, Mary and Paddie.<br> They wake up on the morning|of their 50th anniversary.<br> Mary looks over and|gazes adoringly at Paddie.<br> She's like,|"Oh, Jesus, Paddie.<br> You're such a good-looking|feller. I love ya.<br> I want to give ya|a little present.<br> Anything your little heart desires,|I'm goin' to give it to ya.<br> What would ya like?<br> Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.|That's a very sweet offer.<br> Now, in 50 years, there's one thing|that's been missing,<br> and, uh, I would like you|to give me a blow job.<br> I would like for it."|Mary's like, "All right."<br> She takes her teeth out, puts 'em in|the glass. She gives him a blow job.<br> Afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah, geez,|now that's what I've been missin'.<br> That was the most beautiful,|earth-shattering thing ever!<br> Beautiful, Mary!|I love ya!<br> Is there anything|that I can do for you?"<br> Mary looks up to him and she goes,|"Give us a kiss."<br> - Oh!|- Oh, my God!<br> - That's filthy.|- It's not that filthy.|I've heard filthy.<br> - Get off of me!|- All right. See you guys later.<br> All right.|Take it easy, Bill.<br> So, Skylar,|thanks for comin' by.<br> Changed my opinion|of Harvard people.<br> You don't want to rush|to judgment on that one,|'cause they're not all like me.<br> Oh.

Brother.|- I don't know what you're doin', dude.<br> - You're givin' us a ride.|- What the fuck do I look like to you?<br> - Come on, Chuck.|- You're walkin', bitch.|Will's takin' the car.<br> All right, thanks, sucker.|I appreciate it.<br> I don't know what you're|gettin' all serious about.<br> - You're droppin' me off first.|- It's really out of the way.<br> Oh, okay. Just 'cause you|don't have to sleep in your|one-room palace tonight...<br> don't start|thinkin' you're bad.<br> Hey, wait a minute. You said|we were gonna see your place.<br> - Not tonight.|- Oh, no, not tonight.|Not any other night.<br> He knows once you see that shit-hole|he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.<br> But I wanted to meet|your brothers.<br> We're gonna do that|another time.<br> All right.<br> Need them keys.<br> The stewardess hears this|and goes haulin' ass down the aisle.<br> I yell,|"Don't forget the coffee."<br> No shit!|You didn't say that.<br> For Christ's sake, Marty,|it's a joke.<br> - I know someone that|actually happened to, Marty.|- A joke.<br> - Gerry.|- Hi.<br> - Have trouble findin' the place?|- No, I took a cab.<br> Timmy, this is Gerry.|We went to college together.<br> How you doin'?|Nice to meet ya.<br> - Pleased to meet you.|- Can I get you a beer?<br> Um, no, just a Perrier.<br> That's French|for club soda.<br> - Club soda, yeah.|- Couple of sandwiches too.<br> - Sure.|- Put it on my tab.<br> You ever plannin'|on payin' your tab?<br> Yeah, chief, got the winning|lottery ticket right here.<br> - What's the jackpot?|- Twelve million.<br> - I don't think that'll cover it.|- It'll cover your sex change operation.<br> - Nuts?|- No, thank you.<br> So, you wanted|to talk about Will.<br> - Well, it seems to be going well.|- I think so.<br> Have you talked to him|at all about his future?<br> No, we haven't gotten into that yet.|We're still bangin' away at the past.<br> Maybe you should.

Cured polio.<br> -Ever heard of Albert Einstein?|-Hey.<br> How about Gerald Lambeau?|Ever heard of him?<br> - No.|- Thank you, Tim.<br> - So who won the bet?|- I did.<br> This isn't about me, Sean.<br> I'm nothing compared|to this young man.<br> You ever hear of|Gerald Lambeau?<br> In 1905 there were hundreds|of professors renown for|their study of the universe.<br> But it was a 26-year-old|Swiss patent clerk,<br> doing physics in his spare time,|who changed the world.<br> Can you imagine if Einstein|would have given that up...<br> just to get drunk with his buddies|in Vienna every night.<br> We all would have|lost something.<br> Tim would never|have heard of him.<br> - Pretty dramatic, Gerry.|- No, it isn't, Sean.<br> This boy has that gift.<br> He just doesn't got the direction,|but we can give that to him.<br> Hey, Gerry, in the 1960s,|there was a young man graduated|from University of Michigan.<br> Did some brilliant work|in mathematics.<br> Specifically,|bounded harmonic functions.<br> Then he went on to Berkeley.|He was assistant professor.|Showed amazing potential.<br> Then he moved to Montana, and|he blew the competition away.<br> - Yeah, so who was he?|- Ted Kaczynski.<br> Haven't heard of him.<br> - Hey, Timmy!|- Yo!<br> - Who's Ted Kaczynski?|- Unabomber.<br> That's exactly|what I'm talking about.<br> - We gotta give this kid direction.|- Yeah--<br> He can contribute to the world,|and we can help him do that.<br> Direction's one thing.|Manipulation's another.<br> - Sean--|- We have to let him find--<br> I'm not sitting at home|every night twisting my mustache|and hatching a plan...<br> to ruin this boy's life!<br> I was doing advanced mathematics|when I was 18,<br> and it still took me over 20 years to do|something worthy of a Field's medal.<br> Maybe he doesn't want|what you want.<br> There's more to life|than a fuckin' Field's medal.<br> This is too important, Sean,|and it's above personal rivalry.<br> Wait a minute.|Let's talk about the boy.<br> Why don't we give him time|to figure out what he wants?<br> That's a wonderful theory, Sean.|It worked wonders for you, didn't it?<br> Yeah, it did,|you arrogant fuckin' prick!<br> Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry|that I came here today.<br> I came here out of courtesy.|I wanted to keep you in the loop.<br> Nice to be in the loop.<br> The boy's in a meeting right now|I set up for him over at McNeil.<br> Well, Will, I'm not exactly sure|what you mean.<br> We've already|offered you a position.<br> Nobody in this town works|without a retainer, guys.<br> You think you can find somebody|who does, you have my blessin'.<br> But I think we all know|that person is not gonna|represent you as well as I can.<br> Will, our offer|is $84,000 a year.<br> Retainer!|Retainer.<br> You want us to give you|cash right now?<br> Whoa-ho-ho. Easy--|Now, I didn't say that.<br> Allegedly,|your situation, for you,<br> would be concurrently|improved if I had...<br> $200 in my back pocket|right now.<br> I don't think I can-- Larry?<br> - I've got $73.|- Will you take a check?<br> Let me tell you somethin'.|You're suspect.<br> Yeah, you. I don't know|what your reputation is in this town,<br> but after the shit|you tried to pull today,<br> you can bet|I'll be lookin' into you.<br> Now, any business|we have heretofore,<br> you can speak with|my aforementioned attorney.<br> Good day, gentlemen.<br> And until that day comes,|keep your ear to the grindstone.<br> - How's it goin'?|- Fine.<br> Yeah.<br> Good.<br> - Want some help?|- No!<br> Come on. Give me one little peek,|and we'll go to the batting cages.<br> No.<br> It is actually important|that I learn this.<br> - It's really important... to me, okay?|- All right.<br> - Why don't we just|hang out here all day?|- Yes, why don't we?<br> All right, Mr. Nosey Parker.<br> Seeing as you're intent|on breaking my balls,<br> - let me ask you a question.|- All right.<br> Do you have|a photographic memory?<br> I don't know. I just kind|of remember. I mean, how do you|remember your phone number?<br> You just do.<br> - Have you studied organic chemistry?|- A little bit.<br> - Oh, just for fun?|- Yeah, for kicks.<br> Yeah, it's so much fun|studying organic chemistry.<br> Are you mad?<br> Have you completely|lost your mind?<br> Nobody studies it for fun.|It's not a necessity,|especially for someone like you.<br> - Someone like me?|- Yeah.<br> Someone who divides their time, fairly|evenly, between batting cages and bars.<br> - I would hardly say it was a necessity.|- Oh.<br> You know, there are very|smart people here at Harvard.<br> Even they have to study,|because this is really hard.<br> And yet... you do it|so easily. I don't understand.<br> I don't understand|how your mind works.<br> - Did you play the piano?|- I want to talk about this.<br> No, I'm trying to explain it to you.|Do you play the piano?<br> - Yeah, a bit.|- So when you look at|a piano, you see Mozart.<br> - I see "Chopsticks."|- All right, well, Beethoven, okay?<br> He looked at a piano, and it just|made sense to him. He could just play.<br> - So what are you saying?|You play the piano?|- Not a lick.<br> I look at a piano, I see a bunch of|keys, three pedals and a box of wood.<br> But Beethoven, Mozart--|They saw it. They could just play.<br> I couldn't paint you a picture.|I probably can't hit the ball|out of Fenway.<br> - And I can't play the piano.|- But you can do my|O-chem paper in under an hour.<br> Right. Well, I mean, when|it came to stuff like that,|I could always just play.<br> That's the best|I can explain it.<br> - Come here.|I have to tell you something.|- Huh?<br> - I have to tell you something.|- Oh.<br> Well--<br> - It's not fair.|- What's not fair? What?<br> I've been here for four years,<br> and I've only just found you.<br> Well, you found me.<br> - Are you awake?|- No.<br> Yes, you are.<br> What?<br> I want you to come|to California with me.<br> - You sure about that?|- Oh, yeah.<br> Yeah, but how do you know?<br> I don't know.|I just know.<br> Yeah, but how do you know?<br> I know because I feel it.<br> - Because that's a really|serious thing you're saying.|- I know.<br> You could be in California|next week...<br> and you might find out|something about me you don't like.<br> Maybe you wish|you hadn't said that,<br> but you know it's such a serious thing|you can't take it back.<br> Now I'm stuck in California with someone|that doesn't really want to be with me,<br> - just wish they had a take-back.|- A what? What's a take-back?<br> I don't want a take-back. I just want|you to come to California with me.<br> Well, I can't go to|California with you, so--<br> Why not?<br> Well, one, because|I got a job here.<br> And, two,|because I live here.<br> Look, um, if you don't love me,|you should just tell me.<br> I'm not sayin'|I don't love you.<br> Then why? Why won't you come?|What are you so scared of?<br> What am I so scared of?<br> Well, what aren't|you scared of?<br> You live in this safe little world|where no one challenges you--<br> Don't tell me about my world.|Don't tell me about my world.<br> You just want to have|your little fling with the guy|from the other side of town.<br> Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.|You're gonna marry some rich prick...<br> who your parents|will approve of...<br> and just sit around with|the other trust fund babies...<br> and talk about how you|went slummin', too, once.<br> Why are you saying this?|What is your obsession with this money?<br> My father died when I was 13,|and I inherited this money.<br> You don't think every day I wake up,|and I wish I could give it back.<br> That I would give it back|in a second if it meant I could|have one more day with him.<br> But I can't, and that's|my life, and I deal with it.<br> So don't put your shit on me|when you're the one that's afraid.<br> I'm afraid? What am I afraid of?|What the fuck am I afraid of?<br> You're afraid of me. You're afraid|that I won't love you back.<br> You know what?|I'm afraid too.<br> But fuck it, I want to give it a shot.|At least I'm honest with you.<br> - I'm not honest with you?|- No, what about your 12 brothers?<br> All right.<br> No, you're not going.|You're not leaving.<br> What do you want to know?|That I don't have 12 brothers?|That I'm a fuckin' orphan?<br> - You don't want to hear that.|- I didn't know that.<br> You don't want to hear|I got fuckin' cigarettes|put out on me when I was little.<br> - I didn't know that.|- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.<br> The motherfucker stabbed me. You don't|want to hear that shit, Skylar!<br> - I do want to hear that.|- Don't tell me you want that shit!<br> - I want to help you.|- Help me? What the fuck?<br> What do I got, a fuckin' sign|on my back that says, "Save me"?<br> - No.|- Do I look like I need that?<br> - No, I just want to be with you--|- Don't bullshit me!<br> - I love you.|- Don't bullshit me!|Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!<br> I love you.<br> I want to hear you say|that you don't love me.<br> Because if you say that...<br> then I won't call you...<br> and I won't be in your life.<br> I don't love you.<br> Most people never get to see|how brilliant they can be.<br> They don't find teachers|that believe in them.<br> They get convinced|they're stupid.<br> I hope you appreciate|what he's doing,<br> because I've seen how much|he enjoys working with you,<br> not against you.<br> Hello, Will.<br> Tom, can you get us|some coffee?<br> Sure.<br> Now, let's see.<br> Good. This is correct.<br> I see you used Maclaurin here.<br> Yeah, I don't know what|you call it, but--<br> This can't be right.<br> This would be|very embarrassing.<br> - Did you ever consider--|- I'm pretty sure it's right.<br> Hey, look, can we do this|at Sean's office from now on?<br> Because I got to knock off work to come|here and the commute is killin' me.<br> - Yeah, sure. Did you think|of the possibility--|- That's right.<br> It's right.|Just take it home with you.<br> What happened|at the McNeil meeting?<br> I couldn't go.|I had a date.<br> So I sent my|chief negotiator.<br> On your own time, you can do|whatever you like, Will.<br> But when I set up a meeting|with my associates,<br> and you don't show up,|it reflects poorly on me.<br> - Then don't set up any more meetings.|- I won't.<br> I'll cancel 'em.<br> I'll give you a job myself. I just|wanted you to see what was out there.<br> Maybe I don't want to spend|the rest of my fuckin' life|explainin' shit to people.<br> I think you could show me|some appreciation.<br> A little appreciation?|Do you know how easy this is for me?<br> Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy|this is? This is a fuckin' joke.<br> I'm sorry you can't do this--|I really am--<br> Because I wouldn't have to|fuckin' sit here and watch you|fumble around and fuck it up.<br> Then you'd have more time to sit around|and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?<br> You're right. This is probably|a total waste of my time.<br> You're right, Will.<br> I can't do this proof,|but you can.<br> And when it comes to that,|it's only about just a handful|of people in the world...<br> who can tell the difference|between you and me.<br> - But I'm one of them.|- Sorry.<br> Yeah, so am l.<br> Most days I wish|I never met you,<br> because then I could|sleep at night.<br> I didn't have to walk around|with the knowledge that there|was someone like you out there.<br> I didn't have to watch you|throw it all away.<br> Bill, hold it. Did you hear that?<br> Morgan!<br> If you're watchin' pornos in|my mom's room again, I'm gonna|give you a fuckin' beatin'!<br> What's up, fellas?<br> Morgan, why don't you jerk off|in your own fuckin' house.|That's fuckin' filthy.<br> I don't have a V.C.R.|in my house.<br> Come on. Not in my glove.<br> I didn't use the glove.<br> That's my|Little League glove.<br> What do you want me|to do?<br> I mean, what's wrong|with you?<br> You'll hump|a baseball glove?<br> l-l just used it|for cleanup.<br> Stop jerkin' off in my mother's room.<br> - Is there another V.C.R. in the house?|- It's just sad, bro.<br> So why do you think I should work|for the National Security Agency?<br> Well, you'd be working|on the cutting edge.<br> You'd be exposed to|the kind of technology|you wouldn't see anywhere else,<br> because we've classified it.<br> Superstring theory,|chaos math, advanced algorithms.<br> Code breaking.<br> That's one aspect|of what we do.<br> Oh, come on.|That is what you do.<br> You guys handle 80% of|the intelligence workload.<br> You're seven times|the size of the C.I.A.<br> We don't like to brag about that, Will,|but you're exactly right.<br> So the way I see it,|the question isn't:<br> "Why should you work|for the N.S.A.?"<br> The question is:|"Why shouldn't you?"<br> Why shouldn't|I work for the N.S.A.?<br> That's a tough one,|but I'll take a shot.<br> Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.|and somebody puts a code on my desk.<br> Something no one else|can break.<br> Maybe I take a shot at it|and maybe I break it.<br> I'm real happy with myself|because I did my job well.<br> But maybe that code was|the location of some rebel army|in North Africa or Middle East.<br> Once they have that location, they bomb|the village where the rebels are hidin'.<br> Fifteen hundred people that I never met,|never had no problem with, get killed.<br> Now the politicians are saying, "Send in|the Marines to secure the area,"<br> 'cause they don't give a shit.<br> It won't be their kid|over there gettin' shot,<br> just like it wasn't them when|their number got called 'cause|they were in the National Guard.<br> It'll be some kid from Southie|over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.<br> He comes back to find the plant|he used to work at...<br> got exported to the country|he got back from,<br> and the guy who put the shrapnel|in his ass got his old job...<br> 'cause he'll work for 15 cents|a day and no bathroom breaks.<br> Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason|he was over there in the first place...<br> was so we could install a government|that would sell us oil at a good price.<br> Of course, the oil companies|used a skirmish over there|to scare up domestic oil prices.<br> A cute little ancillary benefit|for them, but it ain't helpin'|my buddy at 2.50 a gallon.<br> They're takin' their sweet time|bringin' the oil, of course.<br> Maybe they even took the liberty|to hire an alcoholic skipper,<br> who likes to drink martinis and fuckin'|play slalom with the icebergs.<br> It ain't too long till|he hits one, spills the oil...<br> and kills all the sea life|in the North Atlantic.<br> So now my buddy's out of work,|he can't afford to drive,<br> so he's walkin' to|the fuckin' job interviews...<br> which sucks because the shrapnel in his|ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.<br> Meanwhile, he's starvin', 'cause every|time he tries to get a bite to eat,<br> the only blue plate special|they're servin'...<br> is North Atlantic scrod|with Quaker State.<br> So what did I think?|I'm holdin' out for somethin' better.<br> I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,|why not just shoot my buddy,<br> take his job,|give it to his sworn enemy,<br> hike up gas prices, bomb|a village, club a baby seal,<br> hit the hash pipe|and join the National Guard?<br> I can be|elected president.<br> - You feel like you're alone?|- What?<br> Do you have a soul mate?<br> Do I have a--|Define that.<br> Somebody who challenges you.<br> - Uh, Chuckie.|- No, Chuckie's family. He'd lie|down in fuckin' traffic for you.<br> I'm talking about someone who opens|up things for you, touches your soul.<br> - I got-- I got--|- Who?<br> - I got plenty.|- Well, name 'em.<br> Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,|O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke--<br> That's great.|They're all dead.<br> - Not to me they're not.|- You don't have|a lot of dialogue with them.<br> You can't give back|to them, Will.<br> - Not without some serious|smelling salts and a heater.|- That's what I'm saying.<br> You'll never have that kind|of relationship in a world...<br> where you're always afraid|to take the first step,<br> because all you see is every|negative thing ten miles down the road.<br> - You gonna take the|professor's side on this?|- Don't give me a line of shit.<br> - No.|- I didn't want the job.<br> It's not about the job. I don't care|if you work for the government.<br> But you can do anything you want.|You are bound by nothing.<br> What are you passionate about?|What do you want?<br> There are guys who work|their entire life layin' brick...<br> so their kids have a chance|at the opportunities you have here.<br> - I didn't ask for this.|- No.<br> You were born with it, so don't cop out|behind: "l didn't ask for this."<br> - What do you mean, cop out?|What's wrong with layin' brick?|- Nothing.<br> There's nothin' wrong.|That's somebody's home I'm buildin'.<br> Right. My dad|laid brick, okay?<br> Busted his ass so|I could have an education.<br> Exactly. That's|an honorable profession.<br> What's wrong with|fixin' somebody's car?<br> Someone will get to work the next day|because of me. That's honor in that.<br> Yeah, there is, Will.|There is honor in that.<br> There's honor in takin'|that 40-minute train ride...<br> so those college kids could come in in|the morning and their floors are clean.<br> - And their wastebaskets|are empty. That's real work.|- That's right.<br> And that's honorable. I'm sure|that's why you took that job.<br> I mean, for the honor of it.<br> I just have a little question here.|You could be a janitor anywhere.<br> Why did you work at the most|prestigious technical college|in the whole fuckin' world?<br> Why did you sneak around at night|and finish other people's formulas...<br> that only one or two people in the world|could do and then lie about it?<br> 'Cause I don't see|a lot of honor in that, Will.<br> So what do you|really wanna do?<br> I wanna be a shepherd.<br> Really?<br> I wanna move up to Nashua,|get a nice little spread,|get some sheep and tend to them.<br> - Maybe you should go do that.|- What?<br> You know, if you're gonna|jerk off, why don't you just do|it at home with a moist towel?<br> - You're chuckin' me?|- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.<br> - No, no, no, time's not up yet.|- Yeah, it is.<br> - I'm not leavin'. No.|- You're not gonna answer,|you're wastin' my time.<br> I thought we were friends.<br> - Playtime's over, okay?|- Why are you kickin' me out?<br> You're lecturin' me on life?|Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.<br> - What winds your clock?|- Workin' with you.<br> Where's your soul mate? You wanna|talk about soul mates? Where is she?<br> - Dead.|- That's right. She's fuckin' dead.<br> She fuckin' dies and you just cash in|your chips and you walk away?<br> - At least I played a hand.|- You played a hand and you lost.|You lost a big fuckin' hand.<br> Some people will lose a big hand like|that and have the sack to ante up again.<br> Look at me.|What do you wanna do?<br> You and your bullshit.|You got a bullshit answer for everybody.<br> But I ask you a very simple question and|you can't give me a straight answer,<br> because you don't know.<br> I'll see ya, Bo-peep.<br> - Fuck you.|- You're the shepherd.<br> Shepherd.<br> White little prick.<br> I just wanted to,|you know, um,<br> call you up,|uh, before you left, um--<br> I've been takin' all these|jobs interviews and stuff,<br> so I'm not gonna be just|a construction worker.<br> Well, you know, I never|really cared about that.<br> Yeah.<br> I love you.<br> Will?<br> You take care.<br> # Someone's always|comin' around here #<br> - # Trailin' some new kill #|- Bye.<br> # Says, I seen your picture|on a #<br> # Hundred-dollar bill #<br> # What's a game of chance|to you #<br> # In this world #<br> # Of real skill #<br> # So glad to meet ya #<br> # Angeles #<br> # Pickin' up the ticket|shows there's money to be made #<br> # Go on, lose the gamble #<br> # That's the history|of the trade #<br> # Did you add up|all the cards left to play #<br> # To zero #<br> # And sign up with people #<br> # Angeles #<br> # Don't start with me|tryin' #<br> Will, come on.|Will!<br> Will, that's it!|We're done!<br> I'm sitting in your office|and the boy isn't here.<br> Well, it's ten past 5:00.<br> An hour and|ten minutes late.<br> # I can make you satisfied|in everything #<br> Well, if he doesn't show up and I file|a report saying he wasn't here...<br> and he goes back to jail,|he won't be on my conscience.<br> # Now be coming true ##<br> Okay. Fine.<br> What's up?<br> Thanks.<br> Ah! God, that's good.<br> So how's your lady?<br> Ah, she's gone.<br> Gone? Gone where?<br> Med school.|Medical school in California.<br> - Really?|- Yeah.<br> - When was this?|- It was, like, a week ago.<br> That sucks.<br> So, uh, when are you done|with those meetings?<br> I think the week|after I'm 21.<br> They gonna hook ya up|with a job or what?<br> Yeah, fuckin' sit in a room and do|long division for the next 50 years.<br> Nah, probably make|some nice bank though.<br> I'm gonna be|a fuckin' lab rat.<br> Better than this shit.|Way outta here.<br> What do I want a way|outta here for?<br> I mean, I'm gonna fuckin'|live here the rest of my life.<br> You know, be neighbors.|You know, have little kids.<br> Fuckin' take 'em to Little League|together up Foley Field.<br> Look, you're my best friend,|so don't take this the wrong way.<br> But in 20 years if|you're still livin' here,<br> comin' over to my house|to watch the Patriots games,<br> still workin' construction,|I'll fuckin' kill ya.<br> That's not a threat. That's a fact.|I'll fuckin' kill ya.<br> What the fuck|are you talkin' about?<br> - Look, you got something|none of us have.|- Oh, come on!<br> Why is it always this? I fuckin'|owe it to myself to do this or that.<br> - What if I don't want to?|- No, no, no. Fuck you.|You don't owe it to yourself.<br> You owe it to me,<br> 'cause tomorrow I'm gonna|wake up and I'll be 50,<br> and I'll still|be doin' this shit.<br> That's all right.|That's fine.<br> I mean, you're sittin' on|a winnin' lottery ticket.<br> You're too much of a pussy|to cash it in, and that's bullshit.<br> 'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything|to have what you got.<br> So would any of|these fuckin' guys.<br> Be an insult to us|if you're still here in 20 years.<br> Hangin' around here|is a fuckin' waste of your time.<br> - You don't know that.|- I don't?<br> - No. You don't know that.|- Oh, I don't know that.|Let me tell you what I do know.<br> Every day I come by your house,|and I pick you up.<br> We go out and have a few drinks|and few laughs, and it's great.<br> You know what the|best part of my day is?<br> It's for about ten seconds:|from when I pull up to the curb|and when I get to your door.<br> 'Cause I think maybe I'll|get up there and I'll knock on|the door and you won't be there.<br> No "good-bye," no "see ya later."|No nothing. You just left.<br> I don't know much,|but I know that.<br> This is a disaster, Sean.<br> I brought you in here because|I wanted you to help me with the boy,<br> - not to run him out.|- I know what I'm doing with the boy.<br> I don't care if you have|a rapport with the boy!<br> I don't care if you have a few laughs,|even at my expense.<br> - But don't you dare undermine|what I'm trying to do here.|- Undermine?<br> This boy is at|a fragile point right now.<br> I do understand. He is at|a fragile point. He's got problems.<br> What problems does he have? That he's|better off as a janitor, in jail?<br> Better hanging out with|a bunch of retarded gorillas?<br> Why do you think he does that?|You have any fuckin' clue why?<br> He can handle the problems.|He can handle the work.|He obviously handled you.<br> Listen to me.|Why is he hiding?<br> Why doesn't|he trust anybody?<br> Because the first thing|that happened to him,<br> he was abandoned by the people|who were supposed to love him the most.<br> Don't give me|that Freudian crap.<br> Why does he hang out with those|retarded gorillas, as you call them?<br> Because any one of them, if he asked|them to, would take a bat to your head.<br> - That's called loyalty.|- Yeah, that's very touching.<br> Who's he handling?|He pushes people away before|they have a chance to leave him.<br> It's a defense mechanism,|all right?<br> For 20 years, he's been|alone because of that.<br> If you push him right now, it's gonna|be the same thing all over again.<br> I'm not gonna|let that happen to him.<br> - Don't you do that.|- What?<br> Don't infect him with the idea|that it's okay to quit, that|it's okay to be a failure.<br> Because it's not okay, Sean!<br> And if you're angry at me|for being successful, for|being what you could have been--<br> - I'm not angry at you.|- Oh, yes, you're angry at me.<br> You resent me, but I'm not gonna|apologize for any success I've had.<br> You're angry at me for doing|what you could have done!<br> But ask yourself, Sean--|Ask yourself...<br> if you want Will to feel that way--|if you want him to feel like a failure?<br> You arrogant shit!<br> That's why I don't come to the|goddamn reunions, 'cause I can't|stand that look in your eye.<br> - That condescending, embarrassed look.|- Oh, come on, Sean.<br> You think I'm a failure.|I know who I am.<br> I'm proud of what I do. It was|a conscious choice. I didn't fuck up!<br> And you and your cronies think|I'm some sort of pity case.<br> You and your kiss-ass chorus following|you around going, "The Field's medal!"<br> Why are you still so|fuckin' afraid of failure?<br> It's about my medal, isn't it?|Oh, God, I could go home and get|it for you. You can have it.<br> Shove the medal up|your fuckin' ass, all right?<br> 'Cause I don't give|a shit about your medal,<br> because I knew you before|you were a mathematical god,<br> when you were pimple-faced|and homesick and didn't know|what side of the bed to piss on.<br> Yeah, you were smarter than me then|and you're smarter than me now.<br> So don't blame me for|how your life turned out.<br> I don't blame you!|It's not about you!<br> You mathematical dick!|It's about the boy!<br> He's a good kid! And I won't|see you fuck him up like you're|tryin' to fuck up me right now.<br> I won't see you make him|feel like a failure too!<br> -He won't be a failure!|-But if you push him! If you ride him!<br> I am what I am today|because I was pushed and because|I learned to push myself.<br> He's not you!|You get that!<br> I can come back.<br> No, come in.|Uh, I was just leaving.<br> A lot of that stuff goes back|a long way between me and him.<br> You know. Not about you.<br> What is that?<br> This is your file. I have to send it|back to the judge for evaluation.<br> Oh. Hey, you're not|gonna fail me, are you?<br> What's it say?<br> - Wanna read it?|- Why?<br> Have you had any, uh,|experience with that?<br> Twenty years of counseling.|Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.<br> I mean, have you had|any experience with that?<br> - Personally?|- Yeah.<br> Yeah, I have.<br> It sure ain't good.<br> My father was an alcoholic.<br> Mean fuckin' drunk.<br> He'd come home hammered,|lookin' to whale on somebody.<br> So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't go|after my mother and little brother.<br> Interesting nights|when he wore his rings.<br> He used to just|put a wrench,<br> a stick and a belt|on the table.<br> - Just say, "Choose."|- Well, I gotta go with the belt there.<br> I used to go with the wrench.<br> Why the wrench?<br> 'Cause fuck him, that's why.<br> - Your foster father?|- Yeah.<br> So, uh, what is it, like,|Will has an attachment disorder?<br> Is it all that stuff?<br> Fear of abandonment?<br> Is that why I broke up|with Skylar?<br> - I didn't know you had.|- Yeah, I did.<br> - You wanna talk about it?|- No.<br> Hey, Will,|I don't know a lot.<br> You see this?|All this shit?<br> It's not your fault.<br> Yeah, I know that.<br> Look at me, son.<br> - It's not your fault.|- I know.<br> No. It's not|your fault.<br> I know.<br> No, no, you don't.|It's not your fault.<br> - Hmm?|- I know.<br> - It's not your fault.|- All right.<br> It's not your fault.<br> - It's not your fault.|- Don't fuck with me.<br> It's not your fault.<br> Don't fuck with me, all right?|Don't fuck with me, Sean, not you.<br> It's not your fault.<br> It's not your fault.<br> My God--<br> My God! I'm so sorry!|My God!<br> Fuck them, okay?<br> - Can I help you?|- Yeah, I'm Will Hunting.|I'm here about a position.<br> Could you just have|a seat for a moment?<br> Yes, there's|a Mr. Hunting in the lobby.<br> Which one did you take?<br> I was over at McNeil. It's one of|the jobs the professor set me up with.<br> I haven't told him yet, but I went|down there and talked to my boss--<br> My new boss.|He seemed like a good guy.<br> - Is that what you want?|- Yeah, you know, I think so.<br> Well, good for you.|Congratulations.<br> Thanks.<br> Time's up.<br> So that's-- So that's it?|So we're done?<br> Yeah, that's it.<br> You're done.|You're a free man.<br> Well, um, I just want you|to know, Sean, that--<br> You're welcome, Will.<br> So, you know, I hope|we keep in touch, you know.<br> Yeah, me too.<br> I'll be travelin' around a bit.|It'll be a little hard, but, uh--<br> I've got an answering machine at|the college I'll be checking in with.<br> So, here's the number.<br> You call that.|I'll get back to you right away.<br> Yeah, you know,|I figured I'm just gonna...<br> put my money back on the table|and see what kind of cards I get.<br> You do what's in your heart,|son. You'll be fine.<br> - Thank you, Sean.|- Uh--<br> Thank you, Will.<br> Hey, does this violate|the patient-doctor relationship?<br> Naw. Only if you|grab my ass.<br> - Take care.|- You too.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey.<br> Good luck, son.<br> Two beers.<br> What's up?|Did you guys go?<br> No. I had to talk him down.<br> - Why didn't you yoke him?|- Little Morgan's|got a lot of scrap to him.<br> People try to whip|his ass every week.<br> - Fuckin' kid won't back down.|- What are you sayin' about me?<br> Was I talkin' to you?|None of your fuckin' business.<br> - Go get me a beer.|- I ordered two beers!<br> - Hey, asshole.|- What, bitch?<br> -Happy birthday.|-Thought we forgot, huh, bitch?<br> - Come on!|- I'm goin'.
