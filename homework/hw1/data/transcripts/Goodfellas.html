                        What the fuck is that?<br> Jimmy?<br> - What's up?<br> - Did I hit something?<br> What the fuck is that?<br> Maybe you got a flat?<br> No.<br> What the fuck?<br> You better pull over and see.<br> He's still alive. You piece of shit!<br> Die, you motherfucker!<br> Look at me!<br> As far back as I can remember,<br> I always wanted to be a gangster.<br> To me...<br> ...being a gangster was better than<br> being president of the United States.<br> Even before I went to the cabstand<br> for an after-schooljob...<br> ...I knew I wanted to be part of them.<br> It was there that I knew I belonged.<br> To me, it meant being somebody...<br> ...in a neighborhood full of nobodies.<br> They weren't like anybody else.<br> They did whatever they wanted.<br> They parked in front of hydrants<br> and never got a ticket.<br> When they played cards all night...<br> ...nobody ever called the cops.<br> Tony Stacks. How are you?<br> Tuddy Cicero.<br> Could this be the Canarsie Kid?<br> Tuddy.<br> Tuddy ran the cabstand<br> and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...<br> ...and other places for his brother, Paul,<br> who was the boss of the neighborhood.<br> Paulie might have moved slow...<br> ...but it was only because Paulie<br> didn't have to move for anybody.<br> - It's your fault.<br> - You started it!<br> I started it? It's your fault.<br> At first my parents loved that I found<br> a job across the street from the house.<br> My father, who was Irish,<br> was sent to work at the age of 11.<br> He liked that I got myself a job.<br> He always used to say<br> that American kids were spoiled lazy.<br> Henry! Watch how you cross!<br> Bring back milk!<br> My mother was happy after<br> she found out the Ciceros...<br> ...came from the same part of Sicily<br> as she did. To my mother...<br> ...that was the answer to all her prayers.<br> I was the luckiest kid in the world.<br> I could go anywhere, do anything.<br> I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.<br> Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy<br> would let me park their Cadillacs.<br> Here I am, this little kid,<br> I can't even see over the steering wheel...<br> ...and I'm parking Cadillacs.<br> But, it wasn't too long...<br> ...before my parents changed<br> their minds about myjob at the cabstand.<br> For them, it was supposed to be<br> a part-timejob. But for me...<br> ...it was definitely full time.<br> That's all I wanted to do.<br> People like my father could never<br> understand, but I was part of something.<br> I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.<br> Tell him 519.<br> Every day I was learning to score.<br> A dollar here, a dollar there.<br> I was living in a fantasy.<br> Did you have a good day at school?<br> My father was always pissed off.<br> Pissed that he made such lousy money,<br> that my brother Michael...<br> ...was in a wheelchair.<br> He was pissed that there were seven of us<br> living in such a tiny house.<br> Tell me about this.<br> It's a letter from school.<br> It says you haven't been there in months.<br> In months!<br> You're a bum!<br> Want to grow up to be a bum?<br> After a while, he was mostly pissed<br> because I hung around the cabstand.<br> He knew what went on there.<br> Every once in a while I'd have to take<br> a beating. But by then, I didn't care.<br> The way I saw it...<br> ...everybody takes a beating sometime.<br> I can't make any more deliveries.<br> What? You'll fuck everything up.<br> My dad says he'll kill me. Look.<br> Come with me.<br> - Is that him there?<br> - No.<br> - How about him?<br> - No.<br> - That's the guy-<br> - Get him.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Scumbag.<br> - Come here, you piece of shit.<br> - Know this kid?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Know where he lives?<br> - Yeah.<br> - You deliver mail to his house?<br> - Yeah.<br> From now on, any letter from school<br> to his house comes directly here.<br> Understand?<br> Another letter from school<br> goes to that kid's house...<br> ...in the oven you'll go, head first.<br> That was it. No more letters from<br> truant officers. No letters from school.<br> In fact, no more letters from anybody.<br> After a few weeks, my mother went<br> to the post office to complain.<br> How could I go to school after that...<br> ...and pledge allegiance and sit through<br> good government bullshit?<br> Paulie hated phones.<br> He wouldn't have one in his house.<br> Mickey called. Want me to call him back?<br> All right, make the call.<br> He got all his calls second hand.<br> Then you'd have to call the people back.<br> Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.<br> There were guys, that's all they did all<br> day, was take care of Paulie's calls.<br> For a guy who moved all day long...<br> ...Paulie didn't talk to six people.<br> With union problems...<br> ...or a beef in the numbers...<br> ...only the top guys spoke<br> with Paulie about the problem.<br> Everything was one-on-one.<br> Paulie hated conferences.<br> He didn't want anybody<br> hearing what he said...<br> ...or anyone listening to<br> what he was being told.<br> Hundreds of guys depended on him, and<br> he got a piece of everything they made.<br> It was a tribute, like in the old country,<br> except they were doing it in America.<br> All they got from Paulie was protection<br> from the guys trying to rip them off.<br> That's what it's all about. That's<br> what the FBI could never understand.<br> What Paulie and the Organization does...<br> ...is protect people who can't<br> go to the cops. That's it.<br> They're like the police department<br> for wiseguys.<br> People looked at me differently,<br> and they knew I was with somebody.<br> I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery<br> on Sunday morning for fresh bread.<br> The owner knew who I was with, and no<br> matter how many people were waiting...<br> ...I was taken care of first.<br> Our neighbors stopped parking in<br> our driveway, even though we had no car.<br> At 13...<br> ...I was making more money than most<br> of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.<br> I had it all.<br> One day...<br> One day, some neighborhood kids carried<br> my mother's groceries all the way home.<br> You know why?<br> It was out of respect.<br> What do you think?<br> Aren't my shoes great?<br> You look like a gangster.<br> They shot me. Help!<br> Henry, shut the door.<br> That was the first time<br> I had ever seen anyone shot.<br> Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!<br> I can't have that in this joint.<br> I remember feeling bad about the guy,<br> but also...<br> ...feeling maybe Tuddy was right.<br> I knew Paulie didn't want<br> anyone dying in the building.<br> You're a real jerk. You wasted<br> eight fucking aprons on this guy.<br> What's wrong with you?<br> I got to toughen this kid up.<br> It was a glorious time.<br> And wiseguys were all over the place.<br> It was before Apalachin<br> and before Crazy Joe...<br> ...decided to take on<br> a boss and start a war.<br> It was when I met the world.<br> And it was when<br> I first met Jimmy Conway.<br> He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29<br> at the time, but he was already a legend.<br> He'd walk in the door and everybody<br> who worked the roomjust went wild.<br> He'd give a doorman $100<br> just for opening the door.<br> He'd give hundreds to the dealers<br> and the guys who ran the games.<br> The bartender got $100 just<br> for keeping the ice cubes cold.<br> The Irishman is here<br> to take you Guineas' money.<br> - Want a drink?<br> - Give me a Seven and Seven.<br> I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.<br> How you doin'?<br> Thank you.<br> Keep them coming.<br> Jimmy was one of the most<br> feared guys in the city.<br> He was first locked up at 11,<br> and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.<br> Hits never bothered Jimmy.<br> It was business.<br> But what Jimmy really loved to do...<br> what he really loved to do was steal.<br> He actually enjoyed it.<br> Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted<br> for the bad guys in movies.<br> Give me your wallet.<br> You might know who we are,<br> but we know who you are.<br> He was one of the city's biggest hijackers...<br> ...of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,<br> shrimp and lobsters.<br> Shrimp and lobsters were best.<br> They went fast.<br> Almost all of them were gimmies.<br> They just gave it up, no problem.<br> They called him Jimmy the Gent.<br> Help the lady.<br> Drivers loved him.<br> They used to tip him off...<br> ...about the really good loads.<br> Of course, everybody got a piece.<br> Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.<br> Henry, come here.<br> Say hello to Tommy.<br> You're gonna be working together, okay?<br> Help him. Go ahead.<br> Jimmy, you got anything good?<br> And when the cops assigned a whole<br> army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?<br> He made them partners.<br> I'd complain, but who'd listen?<br> - What do you need?<br> - Two Luckys.<br> - Here you go, Henry.<br> - Thanks a lot.<br> - What do you need?<br> - One Pall Mall.<br> What are you doing?<br> - It's all right.<br> - Says who? Your mother?<br> How many Pall Malls you need?<br> - Where'd you get the cigarettes?<br> - Get him out of here.<br> - It's okay.<br> - It's not okay!<br> - You don't understand.<br> - You don't understand. Store's closed.<br> - Henry got pinched.<br> - Where?<br> By the factory.<br> Henry Hill. The People of<br> the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.<br> Docket #704162.<br> Yes, sir. That's me.<br> Just stand there. Now stay there.<br> Counselor, proceed.<br> Congratulations.<br> Here's your graduation present.<br> - Why? I got pinched.<br> - Everyone does, but you did it right.<br> - You told them nothing.<br> - I thought you'd be mad.<br> I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.<br> You took your first pinch like a man...<br> ...and learned the two greatest things<br> in life.<br> Look at me.<br> Never rat on your friends...<br> ...and always keep your mouth shut.<br> Here he is!<br> You broke your cherry!<br> Congratulations!<br> By the time I grew up,<br> there was 30 billion a year in cargo...<br> ...moving through Idlewild Airport,<br> and we tried to steal every bit of it.<br> See, we grew up near the airport.<br> It belonged to Paulie. We had friends<br> and relatives who worked all over it.<br> They would tip us off about what<br> was coming in and moving out.<br> If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...<br> ...Paulie's union people scared them<br> with a strike. It was beautiful.<br> It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers<br> and Jimmy was in charge.<br> Whenever we needed money,<br> we'd rob the airport.<br> To us, it was better than Citibank.<br> You got a phone? Come on!<br> Two niggers just stole my truck.<br> Can you fucking believe that shit?<br> There was Jimmy and Tommy...<br> ...and me.<br> And there was Anthony Stabile.<br> Frankie Carbone.<br> And then there was Mo Black's brother,<br> Fat Andy.<br> And his guys, Frankie the Wop...<br> ...and Freddy No Nose.<br> And then there was Pete the Killer,<br> who was Sally Balls' brother.<br> Then you had Nickey Eyes...<br> ...and Mikey Franzese.<br> Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed<br> because he said everything twice.<br> I'll get the papers, get the papers.<br> What is this? Coats?<br> I need suits, Henry, not coats.<br> Suits are up on Thursday.<br> But it's the middle of summer.<br> What'll I do with fur coats?<br> You don't want furs? I'll take them away.<br> No, I want them. We'll hang them<br> in the freezer with the meat.<br> For us, to live any other way was nuts.<br> To us, those goody-good people who<br> worked shittyjobs for bum paychecks...<br> ...and took the subway to work and<br> worried about bills, were dead.<br> They were suckers. They had no balls.<br> If we wanted something, wejust took it.<br> If anyone complained twice, they got<br> hit so bad they never complained again.<br> It was alljust routine.<br> You didn't even think about it.<br> Frankie, what the fuck does 520...<br> ...have to do with 469?<br> What's that got to do with anything?<br> Piece of cake. Don't worry about<br> the alarms. I just got to get a key.<br> - No problems?<br> - I'll take care of it.<br> - Tell him what you were telling me.<br> - Too good to be true.<br> Big score coming from Air France.<br> Bags of money coming in.<br> Americans change their money over<br> into French money and send it back here.<br> - Calm down.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> It's totally, totally untraceable.<br> Our only problem is getting a key,<br> but I got a plan.<br> - Me and Frenchy and this citizen.<br> - Yeah, he's a piece of work.<br> If I'm right, there could be<br> half a mil coming in, all cash.<br> The best time is probably over a weekend.<br> So maybe Saturday night.<br> There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They<br> won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.<br> What about the security?<br> Security?<br> You're looking at it. It's a joke.<br> I'm the midnight-to-eight man.<br> He just comes in like<br> he's picking up lost baggage.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> - It won't be a problem at all.<br> - Good.<br> - We're on.<br> What's really funny is that<br> fucking bank job in Secaucus.<br> I'm in the weeds lying down.<br> He said, "What are you doing?"<br> I said, "Resting. "<br> "Here?"<br> "This ain't no beach or park. "<br> "I'm resting!" I said.<br> He pulls me in, starts asking questions.<br> You know, this and that.<br> "What are you going to tell us?"<br> I said, "My usual. Nothing. "<br> "Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,<br> "No, you'll tell me something today. "<br> I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother. "<br> You saw the paper, Anthony.<br> My head was out like this.<br> I'm coming around and who do I see<br> in front of me?<br> This prick again. He says,<br> "What do you want to tell me now?"<br> I said, "What are you doing here?<br> I said to go fuck your mother. "<br> I thought he'd shit.<br> The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.<br> Funny. You're really funny.<br> What do you mean, I'm funny?<br> It's funny, you know. It's a good story.<br> You're a funny guy.<br> You mean the way I talk? What?<br> It's just, you know. You're just funny.<br> You know, the way you tell the story.<br> Funny how? What's funny about it?<br> - Tommy, you got it all wrong.<br> - Anthony-<br> He's a big boy. He knows what he said.<br> Funny, how?<br> Just, you know. You're funny.<br> Let me understand this.<br> Maybe I'm a little fucked up.<br> But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?<br> I amuse you?<br> I make you laugh?<br> I'm here to fucking amuse you?<br> What do you mean, funny?<br> How am I funny?<br> You know, how you tell a story.<br> No, I don't know. You said it.<br> You said I'm funny.<br> How am I funny?<br> What the fuck is so funny about me?<br> Tell me what's funny!<br> Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.<br> Motherfucker! I almost had him!<br> You stuttering prick, you!<br> Frankie, was he shaking?<br> I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.<br> You may fold under questioning!<br> What's with you?<br> I thought I was getting pinched already.<br> He's on my neck like a vulture.<br> What do you want?<br> This guy didn't want to give you the check.<br> Could you take care of this?<br> No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab.<br> That's what I want to talk to you about.<br> It ain't just this one.<br> It's seven big ones you owe me.<br> $7,000, that ain't peanuts.<br> I don't mean to be out of order-<br> It's good you don't like to be out of order,<br> Sonny.<br> Embarrassing me in front of my friends,<br> like I'm a deadbeat.<br> You're a mutt. You know the money<br> we spend in this fucking-<br> - Don't be like that.<br> - Like what?<br> Do you believe this prick?<br> You think this is funny?<br> What the fuck are you looking at?<br> You fucking moron!<br> You don't want to bring the check?<br> Do you believe this prick?<br> You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.<br> You're a funny guy.<br> That's it, Henry!<br> You want to laugh?<br> This prick asked me to christen his kid.<br> I charged him $7,000.<br> You really are a funny guy.<br> I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.<br> He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.<br> I got to go on the lam<br> to get away from this guy.<br> This ain't right. I can't go here or there.<br> I talk to them a million times.<br> They don't listen.<br> If you tell him, he'll stop.<br> I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.<br> They'll find me in a car in the weeds.<br> You've known this Tommy all your life.<br> This cocksucker's an arch criminal.<br> When I leave my house in the morning<br> I look over both shoulders.<br> This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.<br> - Tell me what to do, I'll do it.<br> - What could I do?<br> If there was something I could do,<br> I would. I'd like to help you out.<br> Tell him what we talked about.<br> Maybe you could come in with me,<br> take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.<br> What are you talking about?<br> You mean the restaurant?<br> It's a classy place.<br> You've been in here a million times.<br> Tommy taking over this joint<br> is like putting a silk hat on a pig.<br> I don't mean any disrespect,<br> but that's the way it is.<br> I'm begging you. What can I say?<br> What am I going to do?<br> What does he want from me?<br> I don't know anything about<br> the restaurant business.<br> All I know is how to sit down<br> and order a meal.<br> Not for you. Just a place to hang.<br> The chef is great. The shows are good.<br> There's a lot of whores coming in.<br> What do you want from me?<br> Tommy's a bad seed.<br> What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?<br> That wouldn't be a bad idea.<br> I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.<br> It's just that he's scaring me.<br> I just need help. Help me, please.<br> Know anything about<br> the restaurant business?<br> He knows everything.<br> He's there day and night.<br> Another fucking few minutes,<br> he could be a stool.<br> You want me to be your partner?<br> Is that what you're telling me?<br> What do you think I'm talking about?<br> Paulie, please.<br> It's not even fair.<br> You don't understand.<br> You run the joint.<br> Maybe I'll try to help you.<br> God bless you, Paulie.<br> You've always been fair with me.<br> Now he's got Paulie as a partner.<br> Any problems, he goes to Paulie.<br> Trouble with a bill, he goes to Paulie.<br> Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...<br> ...he calls Paulie.<br> But now he has to pay Paulie...<br> ...every week no matter what.<br> "Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.<br> Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me. "<br> "The place got hit by lightning?<br> Fuck you, pay me. "<br> Also, Paulie could do anything.<br> Like run up bills on thejoint's credit.<br> And why not?<br> Nobody will pay for it anyway.<br> Take deliveries at the front door<br> and sell it out the back at a discount.<br> Take a $200 case of booze<br> and sell it for $100.<br> It doesn't matter. It's all profit.<br> Then finally, when there's nothing left...<br> ...when you can't borrow<br> another buck from the bank...<br> ...you bust thejoint out.<br> You light a match.<br> Do you need help reaching anything?<br> You look like you're<br> decorating a Christmas tree.<br> She's from the Five Towns.<br> Who?<br> The Jew broad. Diane.<br> I been trying to bang her for a month.<br> She won't go out with me alone.<br> - No.<br> - No, what?<br> No, what? Who asked you anything?<br> Wait to hear what I'm going to say.<br> All right, what?<br> She won't go out with Italians alone.<br> She's prejudiced against Italians.<br> You fucking believe that? In this day<br> and age? What is this world coming to?<br> I can't believe this. A Jew broad,<br> prejudiced against Italians.<br> She won't go out without her girlfriend.<br> So you come along for her friend.<br> See? I knew it. I knew it.<br> What the fuck is wrong with that?<br> - When is it?<br> - Tomorrow night.<br> I'm meeting Tuddy.<br> You could meet Tuddy.<br> Come early and then go.<br> - Why do you always do this?<br> - Don't give me that shit.<br> What did I ask you for? A favor.<br> I do a lot of fucking favors for you.<br> I'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.<br> I don't understand you. She's beautiful!<br> Her family lives in the Five Towns.<br> These Jews got money.<br> Maybe the family owns the whole block.<br> You may wind up with a big score.<br> You with your fucking mouth!<br> I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00<br> and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.<br> Did you have enough to eat?<br> It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.<br> Let me watch your figure.<br> I couldn't wait to go. I was ordering<br> dessert when they were eating dinner.<br> When they were having coffee,<br> I was asking for the check.<br> Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.<br> Joe, can we have the check?<br> What are you doing?<br> - I got to go.<br> - We just got here.<br> I got that thing.<br> We'll leave together.<br> This way we don't go out<br> like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.<br> I couldn't stand him.<br> I thought he was really obnoxious.<br> He kept fidgeting around.<br> You don't mind, do you?<br> That's very annoying.<br> Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,<br> but it'd look funny on my table.<br> - Ready?<br> - Lighten up.<br> We just got here. What are you doing?<br> Before it was time to go,<br> he was pushing me into the car...<br> ...then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.<br> Diane and Tommy made us promise<br> to meet them again on Friday.<br> We agreed.<br> But when Friday came around,<br> Henry stood me up.<br> I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.<br> He really liked you.<br> All he did was talk about her.<br> We were a trio instead of a double date.<br> He should have called.<br> I hope it's nothing serious.<br> But I made Tommy take me<br> looking for him.<br> Tommy, what the fuck?<br> You got some nerve standing me up.<br> Nobody does that to me.<br> Who do you think you are,<br> Frankie Valli or some big shot?<br> I forgot. I thought it was next week.<br> It was this Friday and you agreed,<br> so you're a liar!<br> We can talk about this.<br> Talk to you after what you just did to me?<br> Forget it.<br> I thought you would stand me up.<br> You looked bored. You didn't say anything.<br> Let me make it up to you.<br> I'll think about it.<br> I remember, she was screaming<br> on the street and I mean loud.<br> - But she looked good.<br> - I'll think about it.<br> But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.<br> She had these great eyes<br> just like Liz Taylor's.<br> Hello, Henry.<br> - Ready?<br> - Yeah.<br> Come on.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - What?<br> You have to cover that cross.<br> My mother sees that-<br> Mom.<br> Meet my friend, Henry Hill.<br> My daughter says you're half Jewish.<br> It's just the good half.<br> See you later.<br> You're leaving your car?<br> He watches the car for me.<br> It's easier than leaving it at a garage.<br> It's a lot quicker that way.<br> I like going in this way.<br> It's better than waiting in line.<br> How are you doin'? What's up?<br> Here you go.<br> - How are you doin', Gino?<br> - Good. How are you?<br> Every time I come here,<br> I see you two. Don't you work?<br> Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?<br> Anthony, right in the front.<br> Anything you need, let me know.<br> Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.<br> You gave them $20 each.<br> Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.<br> - Where?<br> - Over there.<br> Thanks a lot, Tony.<br> - What do you do?<br> - What?<br> - What do you do?<br> - I'm in construction.<br> They don't feel like you're in construction.<br> I'm a union delegate.<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> ...the Copacabana is proud to present<br> the king of one-liners...<br> ...Henry Youngman.<br> How are you all? I'm glad to be here.<br> Take my wife, please.<br> I take my wife everywhere<br> but she finds her way home.<br> I said, "Where do you wanna go<br> for our anniversary?"<br> She said,<br> "Somewhere I've never been before. "<br> I said, "Try the kitchen. "<br> Dr. Wellsler is here.<br> Gave a guy six months to live.<br> Couldn't pay his bill.<br> Gave him another six months.<br> I love this crowd.<br> Air France made me.<br> We walked out with $420,000<br> without using a gun.<br> And we did the right thing.<br> We gave Paulie his tribute.<br> Sixty thousand.<br> It's going to be a good summer.<br> I'm proud of you.<br> That is a lot of money for a kid like you.<br> Anybody asks you where you got it,<br> you got it in Vegas playing craps.<br> Check, sir.<br> No. You have to sign for it here.<br> Should I tip him?<br> - How are you?<br> - Okay. And you?<br> - Henry, this is Bruce.<br> - Good to meet you.<br> I'll see you around later.<br> Do you know him?<br> Yeah.<br> He lives across the street.<br> "Roses are red, my love<br> "Violets are blue<br> "Sugar is sweet, my love<br> "But not as sweet as you"<br> One night, Bobby Vinton sent us<br> champagne. There was nothing like it.<br> I didn't think there was<br> anything strange in any of this.<br> A 21-year-old kid with such connections.<br> He was an exciting guy.<br> He was really nice.<br> He introduced me to everybody.<br> Everybody wanted to be nice to him.<br> He knew how to handle it.<br> Don't buy wigs that come off<br> at the wrong time.<br> Morrie's wigs don't come off!<br> Even underwater.<br> And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested<br> against hurricane winds.<br> Forget about money.<br> You can afford a Morrie wig.<br> Call me now!<br> Come in for a personalized fitting.<br> Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.<br> I've been good to you.<br> But there's something<br> unreasonable going on here.<br> Jimmy's being a ball breaker.<br> Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.<br> I never had to pay<br> the vigorish he demands.<br> What am I, a schmuck?<br> You borrowed his money. Pay him.<br> I didn't agree to three points above the vig.<br> What are you going to do?<br> Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?<br> He wants his money.<br> Give him his money and we'll go!<br> Fuck him!<br> Fuck him in the ear!<br> Fuck him in the other ear!<br> Did I ever bust his balls?<br> I could've dropped a dime a million times.<br> Don't call the cops. You're talking crazy.<br> You got money for that commercial!<br> You don't got my fucking money?<br> Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.<br> I'll fucking kill you!<br> Give me the money, cocksucker.<br> Pay me!<br> He'll pay, he'll pay.<br> Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.<br> Jimmy, I'm sorry.<br> You should be sorry. Don't do it again.<br> Give me the fucking money!<br> You hear me? Give me the fucking money!<br> I'll give you... You've got it, kid.<br> You've got it, believe me.<br> Karen, slow down.<br> Where? Stay there. Don't move.<br> It's Karen.<br> What happened?<br> What happened? Are you all right?<br> Who did it?<br> This guy who lives across the street<br> from me that I've known all my life.<br> He started to touch me. He grabbed me.<br> I told him to stop. He didn't stop.<br> I hit him back.<br> And then he got really angry.<br> He pushed me out of the car.<br> You sure you're all right?<br> Why don't you go inside<br> and get yourself together. Clean up.<br> What do you want, fucko?<br> I swear on my mother,<br> if you touch her again, you're dead.<br> Don't shoot.<br> Hide this. Are you all right?<br> Are you all right?<br> I know there are women...<br> ...who would have gotten out<br> the minute their boyfriend...<br> ...gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.<br> I got to admit the truth: It turned me on.<br> Mazel tov!<br> Why don't you be like Henry?<br> He's got a nice girl.<br> He's settling down now. He's married.<br> Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.<br> And you're still bouncing around<br> from girl to girl.<br> It was like he had two families.<br> The first time I was introduced<br> to all of them at once, it was crazy.<br> Paulie and his brothers had lots<br> of sons and nephews.<br> Almost all of them were named<br> Peter or Paul.<br> It was unbelievable.<br> Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.<br> And this is Petey.<br> There must have been two dozen<br> Peters and Pauls there...<br> This is Marie.<br> ...all married to girls named Marie.<br> She looks Italian.<br> And they named all their daughters Marie.<br> And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.<br> I get confused myself.<br> By the time I had met everybody,<br> I thought I was drunk.<br> Paulie, you shouldn't have.<br> Welcome to the family.<br> Sunday dinner?<br> So beautiful. I want to cry.<br> Here's something to help you get started.<br> - The bag. The bag.<br> - What bag?<br> The bag with the envelopes in it,<br> all the money.<br> Don't worry.<br> Nobody's going to steal that here.<br> He didn't call?<br> - He's with his friends.<br> - What kind of person doesn't call?<br> He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call<br> every five minutes.<br> A grown-up would get you an apartment.<br> Don't start. Mom, you're the one<br> who wanted us here.<br> You're here a month and sometimes I know<br> he doesn't come home at all.<br> What kind of people are these?<br> - What do you want me to do?<br> - What can you do?<br> He's not Jewish. Did you know<br> what these people were like?<br> Your father never stayed out all night<br> without calling.<br> Daddy never went out at all, Ma!<br> Keep out of it!<br> You don't know how I feel!<br> How do you feel now? You don't<br> know where he is or who he's with!<br> He's with his friends! Dad!<br> Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.<br> He hasn't digested a decent meal<br> in six weeks.<br> Where were you? Why didn't you call?<br> We were worried! A married man does not<br> stay out like this!<br> Normal people don't act like this!<br> What's wrong with you?<br> You're not normal. She's right!<br> What's wrong with you?<br> What kind of person are you?<br> What is the matter with you?<br> What kind of people are they?<br> We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.<br> But the first time I realized how different...<br> ...was when Mickey had a hostess party.<br> - Karen, where you from?<br> - Lawrence.<br> On the Island. Nice.<br> I'm from Miami. Ever been there?<br> It's okay, but it's like you died<br> and woke up in Jew heaven.<br> Stop picking at that.<br> I'd like to smack his face.<br> The red-haired guy?<br> The guy's hands are all over me.<br> So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands<br> off me, or I'll cut them off. "<br> She means it.<br> He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie-<br> How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.<br> Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,<br> then he'll be there for life.<br> Talk about problems.<br> What about Jeannie's kid?<br> He was in an argument. A $10 card game.<br> He pulls out a gun.<br> The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.<br> When the grandmother hears...<br> ...she has a heart attack and drops dead.<br> Now Jeannie has a husband and son<br> in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.<br> - Jeannie drinks.<br> - Maybe she's depressed.<br> Give me a break. She's drunk.<br> As soon as something happens,<br> you make them out to be saints.<br> They had bad skin and wore too much<br> makeup. They didn't look very good.<br> They looked beat-up.<br> And the stuff they wore...<br> ...was thrown together and cheap.<br> A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.<br> She spends her life in a nightgown.<br> The woman is no angel, believe me.<br> They talked about their rotten kids...<br> ...and about beating them<br> with broom handles and belts.<br> And the kids still didn't listen.<br> When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.<br> I don't know if I could live like that!<br> God forbid, what would happen<br> if you had to go to prison?<br> Mickey said that Jeannie's husband-<br> Do you know why Jeannie's<br> husband went to the can?<br> Because he wanted to get away from her.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.<br> Unless they make themselves get caught.<br> They don't have things organized.<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> You know who goes to jail? Nigger<br> stickup men. Know why they get caught?<br> Because they fall asleep<br> in the getaway car.<br> Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.<br> Come here.<br> After a while, it got to be all normal.<br> None of it seemed like crimes.<br> Henry wasjust enterprising.<br> He and the guys made bucks<br> hustling while other guys...<br> ...sat on their asses waiting for handouts.<br> Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,<br> just blue-collar guys...<br> The only way they could make real extra<br> money was to go out and cut corners.<br> Where's the strong box, you varmint?<br> Don't fucking move! Don't move!<br> - See you at the diner.<br> - I'm riding shotgun.<br> Did you see him give it right over?<br> Back to the hideout to split up the loot.<br> We were all very close.<br> There were never any outsiders around.<br> Absolutely never.<br> Being together all the time made<br> everything seem all the more normal.<br> Police.<br> I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective<br> Silvestri. We have a search warrant.<br> Would you read and sign it?<br> Anywhere?<br> We have to go through everything.<br> You want some coffee?<br> No coffee now, thanks.<br> - Be careful.<br> - We'll just go about our business.<br> There was always a little harassment.<br> They wanted to talk to Henry<br> about this or that.<br> They'd make me sign<br> their subpoenas or warrants.<br> But mostly theyjust wanted a handout.<br> A few bucks to keep things quiet<br> no matter what they found.<br> I always asked if they wanted coffee.<br> Some wives, like Mickey Conway...<br> ...used to curse at them<br> and spit on the floor.<br> On her own floor!<br> That never made any sense to me.<br> It was better to be polite<br> and call the lawyer.<br> "Happy birthday to you"<br> We always did everything together<br> and were always in the same crowd.<br> Anniversaries, christenings.<br> We only went to each other's houses.<br> The women played cards.<br> When kids were born, Mickey and<br> Jimmy were the first at the hospital.<br> When we went to the Islands<br> or Vegas for vacation...<br> ...we went together.<br> No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.<br> I began to be proud that my husband<br> was willing to risk his neck...<br> ...to get us the little extras.<br> But I got Mom to watch the babies<br> tomorrow night.<br> - Can't do it.<br> - Why not?<br> I just can't. I got something lined up.<br> But tomorrow's the only night<br> she can do it.<br> - Pretty please?<br> - I can't. What do you want me to do?<br> - I got to go.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> I need money to go shopping.<br> How much?<br> That much.<br> This much. Give me a kiss.<br> See you later.<br> All right.<br> "I always dreamed the boy I love<br> would come along<br> "And he'd be tall and handsome,<br> rich and strong"<br> Welcome home, Batts.<br> Hi there. How are you?<br> Sit down. Have a drink.<br> Give them all a drink.<br> And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.<br> There's only one Irishman here.<br> It's a celebration.<br> - Top of the morning.<br> - It's good to be home.<br> This is my friend Jimmy.<br> Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.<br> Tommy. All dressed up.<br> All grown up and doing the town.<br> Forgot you were having a party for him.<br> Come here.<br> I'll say hello. How are you, Billy?<br> I haven't seen you in six years.<br> Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.<br> Watch the suit.<br> You little prick. I've known you all my life.<br> - Don't get too big on me.<br> - Just don't bust my balls.<br> If I was gonna break your balls,<br> I'd say, "Go get your shine box. "<br> This kid was great.<br> I used to call him "Spitshine Tommy. "<br> He'd make your shoes look like<br> fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.<br> He was the best. Made a lot of money.<br> No more shines.<br> No more shines.<br> You been away a long time.<br> They didn't tell you.<br> I don't shine shoes anymore.<br> Relax. What's got into you?<br> I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.<br> I'm only kidding with you.<br> Sometimes you don't sound like it.<br> There's a lot of people around.<br> I'm only kidding. We're having a party.<br> I haven't seen you in a long time<br> and you get fucking fresh.<br> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.<br> I'm sorry, too.<br> Now go home and get your fucking<br> shine box.<br> Motherfucking mutt!<br> You fucking piece of shit!<br> Come on, come on!<br> He bought his fucking button!<br> That fake old tough guy!<br> You bought your fucking button!<br> - Don't get nervous.<br> - You motherfucker!<br> Keep that motherfucker here!<br> Keep him here!<br> Come on, you fucking feel strong?<br> Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.<br> He doesn't mean any disrespect.<br> He doesn't mean any disrespect?<br> Are you nuts?<br> Teach this kid a little fucking manners!<br> What's right is right.<br> - You understand what I'm saying?<br> - It's alright.<br> We're hugging and kissing over here<br> and then he acts like a fucking jerk.<br> You insulted him a little bit.<br> You got a little out of order.<br> - I didn't.<br> - You insulted him a little.<br> - I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.<br> - Okay.<br> Let's have some drinks.<br> Drinks on the house.<br> No, have the drink with me.<br> The drinks are on the house.<br> I fucked kids like that in the can.<br> In the ass.<br> Fucking break up my party.<br> You been away for six years.<br> It's different now.<br> I did my fucking time, Jimmy.<br> I came home and I want what I got to get.<br> I got mouths to feed.<br> - You're gonna get it.<br> - You understand?<br> Get the door!<br> Let me shoot him<br> in his big, fucking mouth!<br> Let's shoot him.<br> Fucking mutt dented my shoes.<br> His crew'll be looking for him.<br> This is bad. What do we do with him?<br> We can't just dump him on the street.<br> I know a place upstate.<br> They'll never find him. More tablecloths.<br> I didn't want to get blood on your floor.<br> Go open your trunk.<br> We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.<br> She has a shovel here somewhere.<br> Quiet, I don't want to wake her.<br> Look who's here.<br> What happened?<br> I hit something on the road.<br> Jimmy'll tell you.<br> What happened to him?<br> I haven't seen you in so long.<br> What happened to him?<br> You, too. How are you?<br> Why are you up so late?<br> He came in. You came in.<br> I'm so happy to see him.<br> Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.<br> I'll make you something to eat.<br> - Go to sleep. We're leaving.<br> - I can't. Not while he's home.<br> I haven't seen him in so long.<br> I want to see him.<br> You go inside.<br> This stuff is like lead.<br> Tell me, where you been?<br> I haven't seen you.<br> You haven't called. Where have you been?<br> I been working nights.<br> And tonight we were out late.<br> We took a ride out to the country<br> and hit a deer.<br> That's where all the blood is from.<br> Jimmy told you.<br> It reminds me, I need this knife.<br> I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.<br> The poor thing.<br> We hit the deer and his paw.<br> What do you call it?<br> The paw.<br> - The hoof.<br> - Got caught in the grill.<br> I got to hack it off.<br> Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.<br> I'll bring the knife back.<br> Delicious.<br> Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?<br> I do, almost every night.<br> But get yourself a girl<br> so you could settle down.<br> I do, every night. Then I'm free.<br> I love you! I want to be with you.<br> Settle down.<br> How's your friend Henry?<br> What's the matter? You don't talk much.<br> Talk. What are you quiet for?<br> You don't eat much, you don't talk much.<br> - I'm just listening.<br> - Something wrong?<br> When we were kids,<br> the compares used to visit each other.<br> There was this man. He would never talk.<br> He'd just sit there all night.<br> They say to him, "What's the matter?<br> Don't you say anything?"<br> He says, "What am I going to say,<br> that my wife two-times me?"<br> So she says, "Shut up!<br> You're always talking! "<br> But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.<br> - Cornuto contento.<br> - That's it.<br> It means he's content to be a jerk.<br> He doesn't care who knows it.<br> Did Tommy tell you about my painting?<br> Look at this.<br> It's beautiful.<br> One dog goes one way<br> and the other goes the other.<br> One's facing east, the other west.<br> He's saying, "What do you want from me?"<br> The guy's got a nice head of white hair.<br> Beautiful. The dog looks the same.<br> Looks like someone we know.<br> Without the beard. It's him.<br> It's him.<br> What the fuck is that?<br> For most of the guys,<br> killings were accepted.<br> Murder was the only way<br> everybody stayed in line.<br> You got out of line, you got whacked.<br> Everybody knew the rules.<br> Sometimes, even ifpeople didn't<br> get out of line, they got whacked.<br> Hits became a habit.<br> Guys would argue over nothing.<br> Before you knew it, one was dead.<br> They were shooting each other all the time.<br> Shooting people was a normal thing.<br> It was no big deal.<br> We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.<br> This was really a touchy thing.<br> Tommy killed a made guy.<br> Batts was part of the Gambino crew<br> and considered untouchable.<br> Before you touched a made guy,<br> you needed a good reason.<br> You had to get an okay...<br> ...or you'd get whacked.<br> Saturday night was for wives, but...<br> ...Friday night at the Copa<br> was for the girlfriends.<br> We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see<br> this show.

Of all people.<br> She gave up everybody.<br> Jimmy, me. Even her brother.<br> It took thejury six hours<br> to bring us in guilty.<br> The judge gave us ten years,<br> like he was giving away candy.<br> Ten years in a federal penitentiary.<br> You will now be turned over...<br> ...to the U.S. Attorney General.<br> Toast, guys. Good trip,<br> good life. Get out soon.<br> Good trip, sweetheart.<br> We'll watch the home front.<br> Say hello to those blow-job hacks.<br> Motherfuck them every chance you get.<br> I'll call you when I get a chance.<br> Now take me to jail.<br> In prison, dinner was always a big thing.<br> We had a pasta course,<br> then we had a meat or a fish.<br> Paulie did the prep work.<br> He was doing a year for contempt...<br> ...and had a wonderful system for garlic.<br> He used a razor and sliced it so thin...<br> ...it would liquify in the pan<br> with a little oil.<br> It was a very good system.<br> Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.<br> Get that smell?<br> Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:<br> veal, beef, and pork.<br> You got to have pork.<br> That's the flavor.<br> I felt he used too many onions,<br> but it was still a very good sauce.<br> Don't put too many onions in the sauce.<br> I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.<br> - There are only three small onions.<br> - Three onions? How many tomatoes?<br> - Two big cans.<br> - You don't need three onions.<br> Johnny Dio did the meat.<br> We had no broiler,<br> so he did everything in pans.<br> It smelled up thejoint and<br> the hacks used to die...<br> ...but he cooked a great steak.<br> - How do you like yours?<br> - Medium rare.<br> Medium rare. An aristocrat.<br> When you think of prison<br> you get pictures in your mind...<br> ...of all those old movies with rows<br> and rows of guys behind bars.<br> It wasn't like that for wiseguys.<br> It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy,<br> who was doing his time in Atlanta.<br> Give me two steaks.<br> Everyone else in the joint was doing<br> real time, all together, living like pigs.<br> But we lived alone. We owned the joint.<br> We batted them sons of bitches.<br> You couldn't recognize them.<br> They deserved it.<br> Even the hacks we couldn't bribe<br> wouldn't rat on the guys we did.<br> People used to be able<br> to leave their doors open.<br> Sorry it took so long.<br> That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.<br> - We have to take care of that bastard.<br> - I took care of him.<br> What'd you bring?<br> Some bread.<br> I got peppers and onions.<br> Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.<br> What else?<br> - Scotch.<br> - Nice.<br> - Red wine.<br> - Okay.<br> - Now we can eat.<br> - Some white, too.<br> Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.<br> Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.<br> Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.<br> You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.<br> Read 'em and weep.<br> What are you doing?<br> I'll catch you guys later.<br> Going for a walk in the park?<br> I'll catch you next week. Thanks.<br> - Is there any more?<br> - No, that's it. Have a good weekend.<br> You girls stay right here.<br> - Hold hands.<br> - Go right up front.<br> What?<br> I saw her name on the register.<br> Want her to visit you?<br> Let her stay up all night crying<br> and writing to the parole board.<br> What am I doing here?<br> Where am I? I'm in jail.<br> I can't stop people from visiting me.<br> Let her sneak this stuff<br> in for you every week.<br> Let her fight these bastards every week!<br> Look what you're doing! Stop it!<br> I'm sorry.<br> Let her sneak this shit in for you.<br> Will you stop it?<br> - Let her do it!<br> - Stop it!<br> Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.<br> Belle and Morrie are broke.<br> I asked your friend Remo<br> for the money he owes you.<br> He told me to take the kids down<br> to the police station and get on welfare.<br> It's going to be okay.<br> I've never seen Paulie since he got out.<br> I never see anyone.<br> That's what happens when you go away.<br> We're on our own. Forget everybody else.<br> Forget Paulie.<br> As long as he's on parole<br> he doesn't want anybody doing anything.<br> - I can't do it.<br> - Yes, you can.<br> All I need is for you to bring me this stuff.<br> A guy in here from Pittsburgh<br> will help me move it.<br> In a month we'll be fine.<br> We won't need anybody.<br> I'm afraid.<br> I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...<br> He is not helping us out.<br> Is he putting any food on the table?<br> We've got to help each other.<br> We got to be really,<br> really careful while we do it.<br> I don't want to hear about her anymore.<br> Never.<br> - We missed you.<br> - Are you here to stay?<br> Did you see our pictures?<br> I did the one with the house and rainbow.<br> I did the sun.<br> My chorus concert is in two weeks.<br> Are you coming?<br> Do you like the house?<br> - Get packed. We're moving out.<br> - With what?<br> Don't worry.<br> Just start looking for a new house.<br> I got to go to Pittsburgh.<br> Those guys owe me $15,000.<br> We'll be okay. I got things lined up.<br> Pittsburgh? You have to see<br> your parole officer.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Everything will be fine.<br> Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?<br> What do you want?<br> Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.<br> You look good.<br> Did you eat this good in the joint?<br> I don't want any more of that shit.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Just stay away from the garbage.<br> Inside, you did what you had to do.<br> I'm talking about now. From here and now.<br> - Why would I get into that?<br> - Don't make a jerk of me.<br> Just don't do it.<br> Don't do it.<br> I want to talk about Jimmy.<br> Watch out for him.<br> He's a good earner,<br> but he takes too many chances.<br> I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.<br> Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.<br> He's got too much to prove.<br> - You got to watch out for them.<br> - I only use them for certain things.<br> I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.<br> Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll<br> die in prison. I don't need that.<br> So I'm warning everybody.<br> Could be my son, could be anybody.<br> Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello<br> to some fuck who was selling junk.<br> That won't happen to me, understand?<br> You're out early because I got you a job.<br> I don't need this heat.<br> You see anybody with shit you tell me.<br> Anybody.<br> - All right.<br> - Yeah?<br> Yeah. Of course.<br> It took me a week of sneaking around<br> to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.<br> But when I did, it was a real score.<br> I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.<br> Even with Sandy snorting more than she<br> mixed, I saw this was a good business.<br> I made $12,000 in my second week.<br> I had a down payment on my house<br> and things were rolling.<br> All I had to do was once in a while<br> tell Sandy I loved her.<br> It was perfect.<br> As long as I got the stuff from Pittsburgh,<br> Paulie would never find out.<br> Within a couple of weeks<br> it got so big I needed some help.<br> I got Jimmy and Tommy<br> to come in with me.<br> It's fucking great.<br> You bring your pay slips?<br> Four and a half months of dirt.<br> - It's so good.<br> - I did it.<br> - Do you love it?<br> - It's wonderful.<br> This we had to have made special.<br> Go ahead, sit in it.<br> The others you couldn't even sit in.<br> Okay, ready?<br> Watch the wall with the rock.<br> The electricians did it special. Come on.<br> This was imported. It came in two pieces.<br> Do you believe what they can do?<br> - Nice, huh?<br> - Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?<br> He's looking into everything.<br> It'll make the Air France hold<br> look like peanuts.<br> Come on.<br> - He'll do it, right?<br> - I told you.<br> He's looking into it.<br> We'll see what happens. No promises.<br> Do you understand?<br> There's millions in there.<br> I've been cultivating this<br> son of a bitch for two years.<br> He owes me 20 grand. Once in a lifetime.<br> I could retire.<br> No more nut every week.<br> No more bullshit. My dream comes true.<br> Let's get a drink.<br> These are the guys Jimmy put together<br> for what turned out to be...<br> ...the biggest heist in American history.<br> The Lufthansa heist.<br> Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard<br> and make him get us in the front door.<br> Frenchy and Joe Buddha<br> had to round up the workers.<br> Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them<br> tied up and away from the alarms.<br> Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.<br> He used to play guitar at the lounge.<br> Everybody loved Stacks.<br> He was supposed to steal the panel truck...<br> ...and afterwards compact it<br> by a friend of ours in Jersey.<br> Only Morrie was driving us nuts.<br> Have a drink and shut up.<br> Just because he set this up...<br> ...he bugged Jimmy for an advance<br> on the money we were going to steal.<br> He didn't mean anything by it.<br> That'sjust the way he was.<br> I had everyone working for me.<br> Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.<br> Have a good flight?<br> I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.<br> They're not that bad.<br> And it's worth it, isn't it?<br> Is this the same baby you used last week?<br> No, that was my sister's. This is Deirdra's.<br> Big yawn.<br> She looks like you.<br> That's what the stewardess said.<br> Take it easy.<br> Give me a break. You got plenty.<br> You got all day. Let's make it last,<br> all right? Take it easy.<br> - I got to go.<br> - Where are you going?<br> Don't start. You know I got to go<br> do this thing. Where are my keys?<br> Over there.<br> It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.<br> Why do you think I got you a dishwasher?<br> Fucks up my nails.<br> You got to be smart.<br> There's enough powder here<br> to put us away forever.<br> Loosen up.<br> What are you doing?<br> You don't have to go anywhere.<br> Make them wait.<br> Nobody knows for sure how much<br> was taken in the pre-dawn raid...<br> ...at the Lufthansa cargo terminal<br> at Kennedy Airport.<br> The FBI says $2,000,000,<br> Port Authority Police say $4,000,000.<br> Those sons of bitches!<br> ...from the scene of the heist at JFK.<br> It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest<br> this town has ever seen.<br> Come here, you! Come here!<br> Look at this genius. This genius!<br> Merry Christmas, Jimmy!<br> - Who's this?<br> - This is my wife.<br> Come here. I want to show you something,<br> Jimmy.<br> Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it<br> for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.<br> What did I tell you?<br> I talked to you, didn't I?<br> Didn't I say not to go buy anything<br> for a while? The fucking car?<br> It's a wedding gift from my mother.<br> It's under her name. I just got married.<br> - I love that car.<br> - Excuse me for a second.<br> - I just got married.<br> - Are you nuts?<br> - Why are you getting excited?<br> - Are you stupid?<br> We got a million fucking bulls out there.<br> Everyone's watching us.<br> It's under my mother's name.<br> It's a wedding gift.<br> I don't give a fuck.<br> Didn't you hear what I said?<br> Don't buy anything. Don't get anything.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> What are you getting excited for?<br> Because you're going to get us all pinched.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - I apologize.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> I'm sorry, Jimmy.<br> It's under my mother's name.<br> What'd you say? You being a wise guy?<br> - I'm sorry. I apologize.<br> - What did I tell you?<br> What did I tell you?<br> You don't buy anything, you hear me?<br> You don't buy anything!<br> I'm sorry, Jimmy.<br> The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.<br> I can't believe this. Are you stupid?<br> Excuse me.<br> - Take it off.<br> - Why?<br> Take it off!<br> Didn't I tell you not to get anything big<br> or attract attention?<br> One guy gets a Caddy<br> and one gets a $20,000 mink.<br> I'll return it.<br> Bring it back where you got it. Get it out<br> of here. Understand? Get it out of here!<br> This drink here is better than sex, babe.<br> I'm going to see Stacks.<br> Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.<br> He's so jealous. If I even look<br> at anyone else, he'll kill me.<br> That's great.<br> I tell them all not to attract attention.<br> What do they do?<br> I've been looking all over for you.<br> Listen, I need the money.<br> - Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.<br> - I need the money.<br> I'm relaxing. I need the money.<br> - I did what I had to do.<br> - Not tonight, Morrie.<br> I did my caper. He owes me.<br> Everyone's flashing stuff.

Go have a drink.<br> - I'll talk to him.<br> - It's poison in my eyes.<br> - Morris, are you all right?<br> - No, I'm not.<br> Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.<br> We did it!<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's me.<br> Pete?

And?<br> Happy Hanukkah.<br> - Very funny.<br> - Go get yourself something nice.<br> Lufthansa should have been<br> our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.<br> Six million in cash.<br> More than enough to go around.<br> Yo, Stacks!<br> Open up!<br> What's with you? He ain't ready.<br> I knew you wouldn't be ready.<br> - You didn't bring any coffee?<br> - Do I look like a caterer?<br> Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.<br> Thought you'd have a bitch in here.<br> I did. Where the fuck is she?<br> Always got these hot books around<br> or a bitch.<br> What time is it?<br> - It's 11:30. We were to be there by 9:00.<br> - I'll be ready in a minute.<br> You're always fucking late.<br> You'd be late for your own funeral.<br> What are you looking at?<br> Make that coffee to go. Let's go.<br> What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.<br> A joke. Put the fucking pot down.<br> Stacks was always crazy.<br> Instead of getting rid of the truck<br> as he was supposed to, he got stoned...<br> ...went to his girlfriend's, and by the time<br> he woke up, the cops had found the truck.<br> It was all over the television.<br> They even said they got<br> prints off the wheel.<br> It wasjust a matter of time<br> before they got to Stacks.<br> I got to talk to you.<br> - Have a drink.<br> - Have a drink. Come on.<br> Have a drink. What are you doing?<br> It's an occasion. Have a drink.<br> I still have to talk to you.<br> - What happened with Stacks?<br> - Don't worry about that.<br> - There's feds all over the place.<br> - So what? Where are they going to go?<br> - It's in the papers.<br> - He's worried.<br> What are you worried about?<br> The television and the newspapers.<br> All the shit's out there.<br> - What are you worried about?<br> - You worry too much.<br> Everything is beautiful.<br> Didn't you tell him?<br> Not yet.<br> - What?<br> - Guess what?<br> They are going to make him.<br> Paulie's going to make you?<br> They opened up the books.<br> Paulie got the okay.<br> Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.<br> He's getting made. We'll work for<br> this guy one day. He'll be a boss.<br> I can't believe it.<br> I'm happy for you. Congratulations.<br> Motherfuckers, we got them now.<br> Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.<br> Can I talk to you a second?<br> I masterminded the whole thing,<br> I'm left with dick.<br> They'd be up a creek if not for me.<br> Fuck him! I want my money.<br> I want my money! I've had it up to here!<br> That cheap cigarette hijacker.<br> - Fuck him! I want my money!<br> - Good. Go tell him.<br> Now will you keep you mouth shut?<br> Morrie, you'll get your money.<br> You just got to stop busting balls.<br> All right. You hear me?<br> Everything's going to be fine.<br> "Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,<br> the pipes are calling"<br> Half Mick, half Guinea?<br> I'll sing with an Italian accent.<br> "And down the glen,<br> the glen and down the mountainside<br> "The summer's gone<br> "And all the roses dying"<br> I could see for the first time<br> that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.<br> His mind was going in eight<br> different directions at once.<br> Think Morrie tells his wife everything?<br> Morrie? Him?<br> That's when I knew Jimmy<br> was going to whack Morrie.<br> That's how it happens. That's how fast<br> it takes for a guy to get whacked.<br> He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.<br> He's always acting like a jerk.<br> Nobody listens to what he says.<br> Nobody cares what he says,<br> he talks so much.<br> Make sure you bring him here tonight.<br> - Okay?<br> - All right.<br> Start like this. Sorry.<br> Did I get you in the eye?<br> Stop breaking my balls.<br> I was just stalling for time.<br> I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock<br> to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.<br> But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,<br> I was going along with the program.<br> I pulled out his hair. I bit him.<br> He's out cold.<br> I'm enraged.<br> I wanted to kill this little fuck.<br> I walk away. We start to go in this joint.<br> I don't want to turn around.<br> Jimmy's doing this to me.<br> I don't want to fucking turn around.<br> I don't want to turn around. He picks up<br> his fucking head, he says, "Ah... "<br> I said, "Don't say it! "<br> "Jerkoff! "<br> What are you going to do? What?<br> I fucking fly at him!<br> I got him and I'm banging his head,<br> banging his fucking face.<br> I'm pulling his hair out of his head.<br> I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.<br> He's laying there full of fucking blood.<br> I'm out of breath.<br> Forget about tonight. Forget about it.<br> It was a load off my mind.<br> He never knew how close he'd come<br> to getting killed.<br> Even if I told him he would<br> have never believed me.<br> - Jimmy, could I talk to you now?<br> - You're a pisser. A real pisser.<br> Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.<br> I've never met a ball buster like you.<br> Who loves you more than I do?<br> - I'd do anything for you.<br> - Except stop busting my balls.<br> - Let's go have coffee.<br> - Want to go to the diner?<br> We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.<br> - Which diner?<br> - Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.<br> - They got danishes?<br> - They got everything.<br> Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.<br> Hear about the points we were shaving<br> up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio-<br> I thought he'd never shut up.<br> What a pain in the ass.<br> - What'll we do with him?<br> - Chop him up and get rid of the car.<br> Call me when you're through.<br> - Frank, let's chop him up.<br> - All right.<br> - Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker?<br> - You said chop him up.<br> At Charlie's, not here!<br> Come on, what are you doing?<br> Get out of here.<br> I got a better shot letting him drive.<br> The car's cold.<br> Get out of here! What, warm it up?<br> Get out of here!<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's Belle. Open up.<br> It's Belle. Let me in.<br> Morris didn't come home. He's missing.<br> I know something's happened.<br> Calm down.<br> He's missing! I know something happened.<br> He's probably drunk and fell asleep<br> somewhere.<br> In 27 years he's never been<br> away all night without calling.<br> Something's happened. I know you know.<br> Let me get changed.<br> I'll take you home then look for him.<br> I've been home! I've been on the phone-<br> He's playing cards.<br> - What'll I tell Belle?<br> - Who gives a fuck?<br> Tell her he ran off with some broad.<br> What do you care?<br> - Watch this.<br> - Don't fuck with them.<br> I'll bust their fucking balls.<br> Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.<br> Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.<br> Keep them up all night.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Jimmy was cutting every link<br> between himself and the robbery...<br> ...but it had nothing to do with me.<br> I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me<br> some Christmas money.<br> From then on, I kept my mouth shut.<br> I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.<br> It was his.<br> He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,<br> but that was it.<br> It made him sick to turn the money over<br> to the guys who stole it.<br> He'd rather whack them. What did I care?<br> I wasn't asking for anything.<br> And Jimmy was making nice money<br> through my Pittsburgh connections.<br> Still, months after the robbery<br> they were finding bodies all over.<br> When they found Carbone<br> in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff...<br> ...it took them two days<br> to thaw him out for the autopsy.<br> Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.<br> He was like a kid. We had money<br> coming in through Pittsburgh...<br> ...and even after a while,<br> the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.<br> Jimmy was so happy that morning...<br> ...because this was the day<br> Tommy was being made.<br> Jimmy was so excited,<br> you'd think he was being made.<br> He must have made four calls<br> to Tommy's house.<br> They had a signal set up so he'd know<br> the minute the ceremony was over.<br> - Ma, where are you?<br> - Here I am.<br> - You're home.<br> - Home? I'm leaving.<br> - You look lovely.<br> - I look good, huh?<br> You look wonderful. Be careful.<br> Congratulations.<br> I love you. Don't paint<br> any more religious pictures, please.<br> God be with you.<br> We always called each other goodfellas.<br> You'd say to somebody:<br> "You'll like this guy. He's all right.<br> He's a good-fella, one of us. "<br> You understand?<br> We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.<br> But Jimmy and I could never be made<br> because we had Irish blood.<br> It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.<br> To become a member of a crew<br> you must be 100 percent Italian...<br> ...so they can trace your relatives<br> back to the old country.<br> It's the highest honor they can give you.<br> It means you belong to<br> a family and a crew.<br> It means nobody can fuck around with you.<br> Also, you can fuck around with anybody,<br> as long as they aren't also a member.<br> It's like a license to steal.<br> A license to do anything.<br> How many years since you were made?<br> I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.<br> Brings back a lot of memories.<br> Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?<br> As far as Jimmy was concerned,<br> with Tommy being made...<br> ...it was like we were all being made.<br> We would now have<br> one of our own as a member.<br> - Who's this?<br> - This is Vinnie.<br> What happened?<br> Did we get straightened out?<br> We had a problem.<br> We tried to do everything we could.<br> You know what I mean. He's gone,<br> and we couldn't do nothing about it.<br> What do you mean?<br> He's gone. He's gone.<br> That's it.<br> I knew it!<br> I can't fucking believe it.<br> - They fucking whacked him.<br> - Fuck.<br> Are you all right?<br> It was revenge for Billy Batts,<br> and a lot of other things.<br> That's that.<br> There was nothing we could do about it.<br> Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.<br> We had to sit still and take it.<br> It was among the Italians.<br> It was real greaseball shit.<br> They even shot Tommy in the face...<br> ...so his mother couldn't give him<br> an open-coffin at the funeral.<br> I had a busy day.<br> I had to drop the guns off at Jimmy's...<br> ...to match some silencers he had.<br> I had to pick up my brother<br> at the hospital...<br> ...and pick up some stuff for Lois...<br> ...to fly down to some customers I had<br> near Atlanta.<br> Right away I knew he didn't want them<br> and I'd be stuck for the money.<br> I bought them because he wanted them<br> and now he didn't want them.<br> What good are these? None of them fit.<br> I'm not paying for these!<br> I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was<br> so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye.<br> The drugs are making your mind<br> into mush!<br> I'll take 'em back.<br> My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.<br> Since I would see them in the afternoon,<br> for a delivery...<br> ...I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.<br> Oh, my God.<br> At the hospital,<br> Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.<br> What happened to you?<br> I almost got into an accident<br> on the way here.<br> And I told him I was partying all night.<br> I'm fine.<br> Get over here.<br> Let me check you out.<br> He took mercy on me, gave me Valium...<br> ...and sent me home.<br> My plan was to drop off my brother<br> at the house and pick up Karen.<br> There it is.<br> You see that helicopter right there?<br> Right up there.<br> I think it's been following me all morning.<br> - Get the fuck out. Are you nuts?<br> - I'm telling you.<br> It's the third time I've seen it.<br> At the hospital I saw it.<br> I had to make some stops.<br> I've seen it every time.<br> I've been all over town<br> and I've seen it all day.<br> I was cooking dinner that night.<br> I had to start braising the beef<br> and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.<br> It was Michael's favorite.<br> I was making ziti with gravy...<br> ...roasted peppers...<br> ...string beans with olive oil.<br> I had some beautiful cutlets...<br> ...that were cut just right...<br> ...that I was going to fry up<br> as an appetizer.<br> So I was home for about an hour.<br> My plan was to start dinner early so I<br> could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.<br> Then get the package for Lois<br> to take to Atlanta later that night.<br> I kept looking out the window<br> and saw that the helicopter was gone.<br> Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.<br> Stay here with your Uncle Michael.<br> I asked my brother to watch the sauce,<br> and Karen and I started out.<br> Oh, God. I see it.<br> - Look, it's right there.<br> - Damn!<br> That's it.<br> We got to get to your mother's.<br> See, I told you.<br> It's funny.<br> - It's not the end of the world.<br> - We're going to your mother's.<br> Tell your mother not to touch anything<br> outside of the house. Nothing.<br> Why didn't you go to your mother's house?<br> "Everything's gonna be all right<br> this morning"<br> Let's go shopping.<br> No, I'm not nuts,<br> it's been following me all fucking morning!<br> Alright. He thinks I'm paranoid!<br> I should bring him the helicopter,<br> then we'll see how paranoid I am.<br> Come on, let's go inside.<br> Yeah, it's gone.<br> - I don't hear anything.<br> - Let's go back to your mother's.<br> - They all right?<br> - They're great.<br> Didn't I say you were paranoid?<br> Didn't I tell him?<br> Yeah. I need a hit.<br> Want to see helicopters?<br> Come on, I'll show you helicopters.<br> I've seen enough helicopters for one day,<br> thank you.<br> I had to get home and get the package<br> ready for Lois to take on her trip.<br> Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give<br> the package a whack with quinine.<br> Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.<br> I had the cooking to finish,<br> and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.<br> - It's Sandy. What the fuck is this?<br> - She's a pain in the ass.<br> - When are you coming over?<br> - In an hour.<br> - You staying tonight, right?<br> - I can't. I got my brother tonight.<br> Come on, stop. Stop.<br> We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.<br> - Hello?<br> - It's me. You ready?<br> Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.<br> - Henry says don't let the sauce stick.<br> - I'm stirring it.<br> - Listen, you know what to do?<br> - Yeah, yeah.<br> Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois!<br> This is important.<br> Make sure you leave the house<br> when you make the call.<br> Understand me? Call from an outside line.<br> I mean it!<br> Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.<br> I know what to do.<br> You little hick, just make sure you do it!<br> You're a pain.<br> - Hey! Just do it!<br> - Okay.<br> Un-fucking-believable. All of them.<br> Every fucking girl in my life.<br> - What'd he say?<br> - Nothing.<br> What does she do after she hangs up?<br> After everything I told her?<br> After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?<br> She calls from the house. If anyone<br> was listening they'd know everything.<br> They'd know a package was leaving my<br> house and they'd have the flight number.<br> As soon as I got home, I started cooking.<br> I had a few hours until Lois' flight.<br> I told my brother to watch on the stove.<br> All day long the poor guy's been<br> watching helicopters and tomato sauce.<br> I had to drive over to Sandy's,<br> mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.<br> Do you think you can come over,<br> fuck me, then leave?<br> - Got someplace better to go?<br> - Don't talk like that. Come on.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yeah.<br> You believe me?<br> Do you believe me?<br> - That's the last one?<br> - Yeah.<br> You lying son of a bitch! I hate you!<br> Please stop feeding the dog<br> from the table...<br> ...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.<br> - I have to.<br> - You don't have to.<br> I got to go home.<br> What do you mean you got to go home?<br> We got to tape this stuff to your leg.<br> We got to go soon.<br> I got to go home and get my hat.<br> Forget your fucking hat!<br> Are you kidding me?<br> I need a trip to Rockaway<br> because you want your hat?<br> I got to have it. It's my lucky hat.<br> I never fly without it.<br> Do you understand<br> what we are involved in?<br> I don't care. I need my hat.<br> I won't fly without it.<br> What could I do if she insisted<br> I drive her home for her damn hat?<br> I hid the package and<br> went to take her home.<br> A hat?<br> What the fuck is this?<br> Police! Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!<br> I'll blow your brains out!<br> Shut the car off slowly!<br> I thought I was dead, but when I<br> heard all the noise I knew they were cops.<br> Only cops talk that way.<br> Don't fucking move.<br> If they had been wiseguys,<br> I wouldn't have heard a thing.<br> I would have been dead.<br> Michael! Lock the door!<br> Talk to me. When was the last time<br> you took a collar? I'm talking to you.<br> You don't want to say a fucking word,<br> don't. I don't give a fuck.<br> You'll do 25 years. See how much<br> of a good guy you'll be then.<br> All day I thought the guys<br> in the helicopter...<br> ...were local cops busting my balls over<br> Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.<br> Just get the lawyer.<br> They'd been on me a month.<br> Phone taps, surveillance, everything.<br> You know the boys. All the pals are here.<br> You don't want to talk to me,<br> you'll have a fucking problem all night.<br> Each one of these counts holds<br> I'll slap your fucking head inside out.<br> What, were you guys grocery shopping?<br> Are we going to make a cake?<br> You going to make a fucking cake?<br> You got anything good in there?<br> Is it good?<br> Bye-bye, dickhead.<br> See you in Attica, dick.<br> I spoke to Jimmy.<br> He offered to give me some money.<br> He wants to know what's happening.<br> He just wants to talk to you.<br> Fuck Jimmy and his money!<br> I got to straighten out everything<br> with Paulie or I'm dead.<br> Then you're better off staying in here.<br> They could whack me in here as easy as<br> outside. They're afraid I'll rat them out.<br> People are already walking away from me.<br> I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.<br> Karen finally got her mother to put<br> her house up for my bail and I was out.<br> I remember I had this feeling I would be<br> killed right outside thejail.<br> I knew Paulie was still pissed at me<br> and he's such a hothead.<br> And I was worried about Jimmy.<br> See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out<br> he was in the drug deals with me...<br> ...Paulie would have Jimmy whacked<br> even before me.<br> This is the bad time.<br> I didn't feel safe until I got home.<br> Now my plan was to stay alive<br> long enough to sell off the dope...<br> ...the cops never found, then disappear<br> until things got straightened out.<br> Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?<br> I flushed it down the toilet.<br> What?<br> What was I supposed to do?<br> That was worth $60,000!<br> I need that money! That's all we got!<br> They had a search warrant!<br> That's all the money we had! I was<br> depending on that! Why did you do that?<br> I had to! They were going to find it!<br> - They wouldn't have found it!<br> - They would have! I swear!<br> They would've found it!<br> Why did you do that?<br> - They would have found it.<br> - Why did you do that?<br> Oh, my God!<br> - I had to do it.<br> - Oh, my God!<br> Paulie, I'm really sorry.<br> I don't know what else to say.<br> I know I fucked up.<br> Yeah, you fucked up.<br> But I'm all right now.<br> I can be trusted now. I'm clean.<br> On my kids, I'm clean.<br> You looked in my eyes and lied to me.<br> You treated me like a fucking jerk.<br> Like I was never nothing to you.<br> After what you said,<br> I couldn't come to you.<br> You know, I was ashamed.<br> I'm ashamed now.<br> But I got nowhere else to go.<br> You're all I got. And I really,<br> really need your help. I really do.<br> Take this.<br> And now I've got to turn my back on you.<br> Thirty-two hundred bucks.<br> That's what he gave me.<br> $3,200 for a lifetime.<br> It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.<br> - We got to get out.<br> - I don't want to run.<br> Am I supposed to pick up<br> and leave everything? Go hiding?<br> I don't want to do that.<br> If we stay around here we're dead.<br> You got it? We' re dead.<br> They're right. You took too much<br> of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.<br> How's he doing?<br> He's okay.<br> They sobered him up.<br> Good. Glad to hear it.<br> - What kind of questions they been asking?<br> - I don't know.<br> I got my mind on so many other things.<br> I got no money.<br> The girls are old enough<br> to read the newspapers.<br> Tell him he's got to call me.<br> As soon as you talk to him,<br> he's got to call me. It's important.<br> He doesn't know I came here to see you.<br> It's like he's crazy.<br> - Take this. It's a couple thousand.<br> - Thanks, Jimmy.<br> Don't worry, everything will be all right.<br> I got some beautiful Dior dresses.<br> You want to have them?<br> Pick out a few for yourself.<br> - For my mom.<br> - Yeah, whatever.<br> Not here. In the store on the corner.<br> It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.<br> Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Don't worry.<br> - I'll try.<br> - He's got to call me.<br> Over here?<br> Right down there.<br> It's over there, on the corner.<br> Right there.<br> No! Go ahead! It's right there!<br> No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!<br> My mom's watching the kids!<br> I got to get home!<br> I'll come back later!<br> What happened?<br> Nothing.<br> - What happened?<br> - I just got scared.<br> Got the keys?<br> What happened?<br> I just got scared. It's okay.<br> Are you all right?<br> Ifyou're part of a crew nobody ever<br> tells you they're going to kill you.<br> It doesn't happen that way.<br> There aren't any arguments<br> or curses like in the movies.<br> Your murderers come with smiles.<br> They come as your friends.<br> People who cared for you all your life.<br> They always seem to come when you're<br> weakest and most in need of their help.<br> So I met Jimmy in a crowded place<br> we both knew.<br> I got there 15 minutes early<br> and Jimmy was already there.<br> He took the booth near the window<br> so he could see everyone who drove up.<br> He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.<br> He wasjumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.<br> On the surface,<br> everything was supposed to be fine.<br> We were supposed to be discussing<br> my case.<br> But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying<br> to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.<br> I been telling you your whole life,<br> don't talk on the phone.<br> Now you understand?<br> It's going to be okay.<br> You got a good chance to beat this case.<br> Well, you know that kid from the city<br> we were talking about? You know?<br> The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon<br> as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.<br> I know where he is. He's hiding out.<br> Know what I'm saying?<br> Would you have a problem going<br> with Anthony to take care of that?<br> No, not at all.<br> That way they got nothing.<br> Jimmy had never asked me<br> to whack somebody before.<br> But now he's asking me to go to Florida<br> and do a hit with Anthony.<br> That's when I knew I would never<br> have come back from Florida alive.<br> Wherever you move me,<br> I asked once and I'll tell you again...<br> ...I don't want to go any place cold.<br> You don't have a choice.<br> Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...<br> ...just no place cold. Do that for me.<br> He's bronchial, that's why.<br> If he's bronchial we'll consider that.<br> I'd like to go someplace not cold.<br> Can I ask you some questions?<br> What about my parents?<br> What about them?<br> Am I going to see them?<br> Am I going to talk to them?<br> Don't I have some kind of contact<br> with them?<br> No.<br> Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br> You mean to tell me...<br> ...if something happens to my parents<br> and they get sick, I can't see them?<br> Maybe something can be worked out<br> if they're sick.<br> If there's extraordinary circumstances-<br> I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.<br> I can't leave my parents.<br> Karen, I told you before.<br> I'm not going to do this unless<br> you and the kids come with me.<br> I can't do it without you.<br> So you do whatever, but... that's it.<br> - You need Henry, not me, right?<br> - That's right.<br> I don't care whether you go or not.<br> If it'll make him a better witness,<br> I want you with him.<br> They don't want me.<br> Henry'll be in the protection program.<br> They can't get to him.<br> They can only get to him<br> by getting to you or your kids.<br> If he goes into the program<br> you're in danger.<br> - I don't know anything.<br> - Don't give me...<br> ...the babe-in-the-woods routine.<br> I've listened to those wiretaps<br> and I've heard you talk about cocaine.<br> Conversation after conversation<br> you talked to Henry on the phone.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> Whether he goes to jail...<br> ...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.<br> He knows it and you know it.<br> What about the kids and school?<br> I mean, what goes on?<br> Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.<br> Whoever sold you those suits<br> had a sense of humor.<br> What it comes down to is<br> we're your only salvation.<br> We'll save your life, his life,<br> and we'll keep you out of jail.<br> This morning you told the jury<br> about your background.<br> It was easy for us to disappear.<br> My house was in my mother-in-law's name.<br> My cars were registered to my wife.<br> My Social Security cards<br> and driver's licenses were phonies.<br> I never voted or paid taxes.<br> My birth certificate and arrest sheet<br> were all that showed I was alive.<br> - Do you see him here in this courtroom?<br> - Yes.<br> Will you please point him out for the jury?<br> Let the record show that Mr. Hill<br> identified the defendant, James Conway.<br> Do you also know a man<br> named Paul Cicero?<br> - Do you see him in the courtroom?<br> - Yes.<br> Can you point him out for the jury?<br> Let the record show Mr. Hill<br> identified the defendant Paul Cicero.<br> I have a document...<br> The hardest thing was leaving the life.<br> I still loved the life.<br> We were treated like movie stars<br> with muscle. We had it all.<br> Our wives, mothers, kids,<br> everybody rode along.<br> I had paper bags filled withjewelry<br> stashed in the kitchen.<br> I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.<br> People call them rats because<br> they will do anything to survive.<br> - Objection!<br> - Objection sustained.<br> - I know nothing about being a rat.<br> - You know everything about it!<br> Anything I wanted was a phone call away.<br> Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts<br> all over the city.<br> I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...<br> ...then blow the winnings in a week<br> or go to sharks to pay the bookies.<br> Didn't matter.<br> It didn't mean anything. When I was broke<br> I would go rob some more.<br> We ran everything.<br> We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.<br> We paid off judges.<br> Everybody had their hands out.<br> Everything was for the taking.<br> And now it's all over.<br> That's the hardest part.<br> Today everything is different.<br> There's no action. I have to wait around<br> like everyone else.<br> Can't even get decent food.<br> After I got here I ordered spaghetti<br> with marinara sauce...<br> ...and I got egg noodles and ketchup.<br> I'm an average nobody.<br> I get to live the rest of my life<br> like a schnook.<br>
