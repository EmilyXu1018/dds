Good boy.<br> - Of course, sir.<br> I have to make a telephone call<br> to California in a couple of hours.<br> - I can't find a telephone.<br> - Well, there's a telephone just here on the left.<br> Oh, wonderful. Thank you. You know,<br> of course, I'll reverse the charges.<br> Yes.<br> There's a new restaurant in the Strand.<br> It's an automatic restaurant.<br> It's open 24 hours a day.<br> You can go in any time day or night.<br> So who's the funny<br> little American?<br> - Morris Weissman.<br> He's a friend of Ivor. - Oh.<br> He makes films in Hollywood<br> Ivor asked if he could bring him along.<br> Didn't see why not.<br> I thought he might be interested<br> in guns and shooting.<br> Oh, well, never mind.<br> He adds to the glamor of the gathering.<br> I didn't expect anything<br> half as exotic.<br> Oh, no, not for me.<br> You know that I hate drinking whisky.<br> Go on, drink it.<br> Do you good.<br> Go on.<br> Oh, really, Bill.<br> You are such a bad influence.<br> Well, don't blame me<br> if I start misbehaving.<br> I don't know how impressed<br> your husband is with our Hollywood folk<br> Well, you know Raymond.<br> He only feels safe with his own kind.<br> Bill!<br> I thought ladies' maids<br> never wore aprons.<br> Her Ladyship used to have a French maid<br> who wore a black one like this.<br> She thinks it's got<br> a bit of style.<br> I bet she does, and I bet<br> she took it out of your wages too.<br> She likes to have<br> everything just so.<br> Mmm.<br> Don't they all.<br> - That's him.<br> - Who?<br> Ivor Novello.<br> He passed us on the road today<br> on his way here, and he spoke to me.<br> Well, he spoke to Her Ladyship,<br> but I answered.<br> I only cut it out for Garbo.<br> I prefer the American stars.<br> I think they've got more oomph.<br> Go on!<br> - Is he really Sir William's cousin?<br> - Yep.<br> Imagine having a film star<br> in the family.<br> - Lady Sylvia must be thrilled.<br> - Oh, I don't think.<br> Why wouldn't she be?<br> 'Cause she's a snobbish cow.<br> 'Cause she...<br> She looks down on anyone who got<br> to the top with brains and hard work.<br> Just like she looks down on her husband,<br> except when it's time to foot the bills.<br> And then she's got<br> her hand out, all right.<br> - What was her family, then'?<br> - What'd you expect, really?<br> Toffee-nosed and useless.<br> Her father was<br> the Earl of Carton.<br> Sounds good, except<br> he didn't have a pot to piss in.<br> - What's she like to work for?<br> - She's horrible. But he's...<br> He's okay. Come on.<br> We better get cracking.<br> - Hello, I'm Ivor.<br> - I know who you are.<br> - Mabel Nesbitt.<br> - Hello, Mabel.<br> - How are you?<br> - Very well, thank you.<br> Oh! I don't smoke.<br> Thank you.<br> Mrs. Nesbitt's only got one dress with her.<br> Says her husband rushed her when she was packing.<br> Do you always look after visitors<br> if they haven't got a maid?<br> Sometimes Dorothy helps,<br> though why Mrs. Wilson...<br> makes the still room maid<br> do it beats me.<br> I think she only does it<br> to annoy Mrs. Croft.<br> - Which one does Dorothy answer to?<br> - Both. That's the problem.<br> She's rushed off her feet as it is.<br> Are you nearly done there?<br> - Yes.<br> - Here she is... Miss Bossy.<br> Tell me, what was Greta Garbo<br> really like'?<br> - Did you get to know her?<br> - Yes, I did, actually.<br> She's coming to stay<br> with me next month.<br> Tell me, how much longer are you<br> going to go on... making films?<br> I suppose that rather depends on how much<br> longer the public want to see me in them.<br> Yes, it must be hard to know,<br> when it's time to throw in the towel.<br> What a pity about<br> that last one of yours.<br> What-What was it called?<br> - The Dodger.<br> - The Lodger.<br> The Lodger.<br> And it must be so disappointing...<br> when something just, you know,<br> flops like that.<br> Yes, it is...<br> rather disappointing.<br> Look at this.<br> Machine-made lace.<br> - Hark at her.<br> - Well, I hate cheap clothes.<br> They're twice the work,<br> and they never look as good.<br> I'll murder that dog one day.<br> Look at that. All over his waistcoat.<br> What do you expect from a woman<br> without her own maid?<br> Lady Lavinia says a woman who travels<br> with no maid has lost her self-respect.<br> - She calls it "giving in."<br> - I don't have a maid. I haven't given in.<br> - That's different.<br> - Why?<br> - What's your name?<br> - I think here I'm called Trentham.<br> No, I meant your real name.<br> Oh. Mary.<br> Mary Maceachran.<br> Blimey. What does<br> Her Ladyship call you?<br> Well, she should call me Maceachran,<br> now I'm a lady's maid.<br> That's what my mother says.<br> But Her Ladyship can't pronounce it,<br> so she calls me Mary.<br> I don't blame her.<br> Sylvia.<br> I'm serious.<br> There mustn't be any more nonsense.<br> I don't know what<br> you're talking about.<br> Done much shooting this year?<br> Quite a lot.<br> - Hello.<br> - Does Louisa always go out with you?<br> - Usually.<br> - It's very good of her.<br> - Do you have a minute?<br> - Don't do that! That's bad for him!<br> Put him down.<br> Yeah. Bores me stiff.<br> - All right, Pip.<br> - I just wondered...<br> William's such a rotten shot. I usually try<br> and duck out of it, particularly in Scotland.<br> I'm rather fond of Scotland.<br> All right,<br> get on with your work. Yes?<br> - Ah, Mr. Weissman. There you are.<br> - I'm dealing with this.<br> - What is it, Mr. Weissman'?<br> - Well, to start with, my name is Denton.<br> - Henry Denton.<br> - You're here as valet to Mr. Weissman.<br> That means you'll be known as Mr. Weissman<br> below stairs for the duration of your stay.<br> We stick to the old customs here.<br> It saves confusion.<br> - It's about Mr. Weissman's diet.<br> - Yes?<br> - He's a vegetarian.<br> - A what? - A vegetarian.<br> He doesn't eat meat.<br> He eats fish, but not meat.<br> Well, I never!<br> Doesn't eat meat?<br> He's coming for a shooting party,<br> and he doesn't eat meat.<br> Mr. Weissman doesn't<br> intend to shoot.<br> I think he just wants to walk<br> out with them, get a bit of air.<br> Get a bit of air?<br> Yes, thank you.<br> We'll make the necessary arrangements.<br> Now I suggest you get one of<br> the servants to take you upstairs.<br> Mr. Weissman is in the Green bedroom, and you'll<br> be sharing with Lord Stockbridge's valet...<br> Robert Parks.<br> He's very full of himself, I must say.<br> "Doesn't eat meat."<br> Now, now, Mrs. Croft. We don't want<br> to be thought unsophisticated, do we?<br> Mr. Weissman's an American.<br> They do things differently there.<br> Good boy, now.<br> Give Louisa a kiss from me.<br> Darling, I'm sorry about that.<br> - I should have made it clear that Morris just doesn't shoot.<br> - Don't worry.<br> William's just making a fuss.<br> He has this ridiculous idea...<br> that Americans all sleep<br> with guns under their pillows.<br> They do, but they're more for<br> each other than for killing birds.<br> Remind me.<br> How are you related to William exactly?<br> Our mothers were first cousins.<br> Don't believe<br> I ever met William's mother.<br> Didn't she do something<br> rather original?<br> Well, she was a teacher.<br> And so was mine.<br> - That's marvelous, isn't it?<br> - Sylvia is so clever.<br> She always finds<br> such wonderful servants.<br> - I don't know how she manages.<br> - I'm breaking in a new maid.<br> I'm simply worn out with it.<br> Actually, there's nothing<br> more exhausting, is there?<br> - I don't have a lady's maid.<br> - Oh. Hello.<br> I was just telling dear Mabel here<br> about my new maid.<br> Honestly, the amount I have to do<br> for her, she should be paying me.<br> She does seem rather young.<br> Well, of course, what she is,<br> my dear, is wonderfully cheap.<br> You've no right to pull me away<br> in mid-conversation.<br> Mabel, where are you going?<br> The room's this way.<br> Why the hell did you have to mention<br> you don't have a maid?<br> Why would you mention you didn't<br> have a maid, for God's sake?<br> You'd find it a lot easier to clean<br> them if you put the trees in first.<br> I was just about to do that.<br> - Are these Mr. Novello's shoes?<br> - Yes.<br> - Do you really live in Hollywood'?<br> - I do.<br> Hmm. How did you get there?<br> Where did you start from?<br> Where else do you think?<br> Scotland.<br> Were you always in service?<br> Did you ever think of trying to<br> get into films while you were there?<br> I wanted to be an actor once...<br> when I was little.<br> I suppose old Mother Trentham...<br> will have her begging bowl out<br> while she's here.<br> She won't be bothering<br> your employers, that's certain.<br> - Why not?<br> - Because Lady Lavinia Meredith...<br> - hasn't got a penny to bless herself with.<br> - And whose fault is that?<br> There's nothing wrong<br> with the commander.<br> He's just been a bit unfortunate.<br> I'll say.<br> I think he's pathetic.<br> Then why don't you<br> hand in your notice?<br> Well, the other two sisters<br> fell on their feet.<br> Of course, it helps<br> that they're both good-looking.<br> - Lady Sylvia's lovely.<br> - You think so?<br> - She might have done a bit better for herself, really.<br> - I beg your pardon.<br> Lord Carton was determined to have Sir<br> William for either of the two eldest.<br> I was told he could have<br> had his pick.<br> - Why was Lord Carton so keen?<br> - Why do you think?<br> Who do you suppose pays for him to swan<br> around Biarritz for six months of the year?<br> Come to that, who keeps Ma Trentham<br> in stockings and gin?<br> - Old money bags, that's who.<br> - I think it's disgusting the way they all use him.<br> None of the rest of them have got the brains<br> to make the price of a packet of tea.<br> - Are you finished, Elsie?<br> - Yes, Mrs. Wilson.<br> - I've just got this hem to do.<br> - What's Lord Stockbridge like?<br> He thinks he's God Almighty.<br> They all do.<br> Why does this fork go on the right?<br> Because they eat the fish<br> with two of them.<br> - One in each hand.<br> - Why is that, then?<br> - Search me.<br> - What are you doing here?<br> - Just looking around.<br> - Mr. Jennings will be up in a minute.<br> If I were you,<br> I'd go and look around somewhere else.<br> - Is that what you'd do?<br> - That's exactly what I would do.<br> Then that's what I'll do.<br> - Something funny about that bloke.<br> - His accent for a start.<br> - What do you think his game is?<br> - I don't know.<br> Are you finished? What about<br> Lord Rupert Standish and Mr. Blond?<br> Her Ladyship said<br> not to wait for them.<br> The stuff's all ready if they turn up on time.<br> We can stick on two extra places in a jiffy.<br> When they arrive, you'll be<br> dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.<br> - Mr. Blond'?<br> - Yes, Mr. Blond.<br> George, you'll have Lord Rupert.<br> If they're very late,<br> they can change by themselves,<br> and you can tidy up<br> when they're downstairs.<br> Is Mr. Nesbitt settled?<br> I'll go and finish<br> him off now, sir.<br> - And Mr. Novello?<br> - Mr. Weissman's man will attend to him.<br> Right.<br> After you're finished,<br> join me in the drawing room<br> with the drinks.<br> - What's the matter with you?<br> - Nothing.<br> Only I thought I'd be doing<br> Mr. Novello, that's all.<br> Now you won't get to see him<br> in his under drawers.<br> Never mind.<br> Better luck next time.<br> They're rather a mixed bunch.<br> That Mr. Weissman's very odd.<br> Apparently, he produces<br> motion pictures.<br> The Charlie Chan mysteries.<br> Or does he direct them?<br> I never know the difference.<br> Really?<br> I enjoy those, milady.<br> Ye... Mary.<br> I suppose it's fun<br> having a film star staying.<br> There's always so little to talk about<br> after the first flush of recognition.<br> And why has Freddie Nesbitt brought<br> that awful, common little wife of his?<br> I mean, Isobel only asked him<br> because a gun dropped out.<br> That's no excuse<br> to inflict her on us all.<br> Mary!<br> So what's the gossip<br> in the servants' hall?<br> - Um, nothing, milady.<br> - Hmm?<br> Nonsense.<br> Come on. Out with it.<br> Well, is it true<br> that Sir William...<br> could have married Lady Stockbridge<br> if he'd wanted to?<br> Is that what they're saying?<br> Only that Lord Carton was<br> after Sir William for one of them,<br> but he didn't care which.<br> What would you say if I told you...<br> they cut cards for him?<br> William, Lewis said you wanted me.<br> - Who's next to me at dinner?<br> - Oh, you know.<br> - Aunt Constance and Lavinia.<br> - Why do I have to have that bloody old trout all the time?<br> - I want Louisa.<br> - Do I have to explain the table of precedence again?<br> - I don't give a shit about precedence.<br> - Well, you always complain...<br> that people look down on you,<br> and then you behave like a peasant.<br> Now, tomorrow morning, I'll...<br> I'll breakfast in bed,<br> and then get straight up<br> into the tweeds.<br> - What shirt have you brought?<br> - Um, the green with the pink stripe.<br> Oh, no, dear. No.<br> That's quite wrong.<br> No, always something<br> very plain for country sports.<br> The one I had on today will do.<br> - But it's soiled.<br> - Yeah, well, you can wash it, can't you?<br> God. I hate shooting.<br> Why does one<br> have to do these things?<br> Has Constance asked for money yet?<br> - No.<br> - Raymond tells me...<br> she's been complaining that<br> her allowance isn't big enough.<br> Good mind to stop it completely.<br> I thought it was for her lifetime.<br> No, no.<br> - Will that be all, sir?<br> - Mmm.<br> I do wish that Anthony wasn't here.<br> Make sure I'm not<br> left alone with him, will you?<br> - Why?<br> - I'm pulling out of his scheme.<br> - Oh. Have you told him?<br> - No, and I'm not going to either.<br> Louisa said I should leave it<br> till next week.<br> Let him sob in private.<br> Go. Say hello to your mommy.<br> Go on.<br> Far be it from me<br> to contradict Louisa.<br> - Will there be anything else?<br> - Just get Pip. He might fall down the stairs.<br> Hey, hey, come here.<br> Come here.<br> Thank you, Elsie.<br> You keep hold of him.<br> - Is everything all right?<br> - Cheap dress, wrong shoes.<br> I'm making bricks without straw,<br> Mr. Probert, really.<br> You don't have any<br> spare hairpins, do you?<br> Yeah. I'm trying to get back to the room<br> for a second, and I can't find it.<br> It's the staircase<br> at the end of the corridor.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Ah.<br> Oh, Pip.<br> Oh, thank you, Elsie.<br> Thank you. Oh!<br> You've got some hair on your dress.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Yes.<br> Shut up, Mabel! There is<br> nothing going on between me and Isobel.<br> Can't you just tell me the truth?<br> You're a liar, Freddie.<br> - There is nothing...<br> - You are a liar!<br> Don't you call me a liar!<br> I found some pins, madam,<br> from Lady Trentham's maid.<br> Right.<br> We're supposed to be<br> downstairs already.<br> Well, you go on.<br> I'll be down in a minute.<br> Try and make her look respectable.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Well... there's no harm in trying.<br> Well, thank you very much, Mr. Jennings.<br> - Just Jennings, sir.<br> - All right.<br> Just Jennings.<br> Oh, by the way, I've booked<br> a telephone call to California,<br> and I'd appreciate it if you would<br> get me as soon as it comes through.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - Thank you, Jennings.<br> You're not gonna provide<br> entertainment?<br> That's how you got your invitation.<br> Oh, no, don't get up.<br> - Please, go on.<br> - You look lovely in that dress, if I may say so.<br> What is it? I don't recognise it.<br> A little something I'm working on.<br> I can't imagine how one<br> ever goes about inventing a tune.<br> Where do you start?<br> It's rather difficult to say.<br> Well, I think<br> you're too clever for words.<br> - Good evening.<br> - Hello.<br> - Lovely dress.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hi.<br> How do you manage<br> to put up with these people?<br> Well, you forget I earn my living<br> by impersonating them.<br> Can I help you?<br> You know, I really enjoy the way<br> you do things, Mr. Jennings.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> - What is it, Henry'?<br> - Nothing.<br> I just wanted to be sure<br> you had everything you need, sir.<br> Yes, I do.<br> Thank you.<br> It's wonderful to find a servant these days who<br> really shows an interest, don't you think?<br> Sir.<br> Come on, girls. Sit down.<br> Tuck in. We've got 20 minutes.<br> Shuffle along. Here he comes.<br> - Everything satisfactory, Mr. Jennings?<br> - Yes, thank you, Dorothy.<br> They have their drinks. I think we can all<br> take our leisure for half an hour or so.<br> - What's this?<br> - I believe this is my place, Mr. Jennings.<br> And since when did a baroness<br> outrank a countess?<br> Miss Trentham, would you<br> take the place of honor, please?<br> Miss Trentham?<br> I'm all right here,<br> Mr. Jennings. Thank you.<br> Go on.<br> Don't keep him waiting.<br> Ah, Miss Meredith.<br> Would you come and sit on my left?<br> Naturally, I'm nothing when<br> there are visitors in the house.<br> - Never mind. I'm used to it.<br> - Good evening, Mrs. Wilson.<br> Good evening.<br> For what we are about to receive,<br> may the Lord make us truly grateful.<br> Right. Start when you get it.<br> No time for loitering.<br> I'm not serving tonight,<br> Mr. Jennings, am I?<br> Not tonight, Elsie,<br> but probably tomorrow.<br> Where is Mrs. Croft?<br> Always eats with her own staff.<br> Does she take her pudding to<br> Mrs. Wilson's room? Our cook does that.<br> Fat chance. They hate each other.<br> - Can I ask a question?<br> - Certainly, Mr. Weissman.<br> How can we help you?<br> I just wondered, how many people here<br> had parents in service?<br> And was that why<br> they chose to go into it?<br> What an interesting question, and one to which,<br> I'm afraid, I cannot provide the answer.<br> All of you whose parents<br> were in service, raise your hand.<br> - My father was.<br> - Both... nanny and groom.<br> - Not you, Dorothy?<br> - My father was a farmer, Mr. Jennings.<br> A tenant of Lord Carton's<br> - Mr. Meredith?<br> - Factory hands, both of them.<br> And if you ask me,<br> they were better off.<br> What about you, Mr. Stockbridge?<br> What's the matter? Don't you know?<br> Yeah, I know what they did.<br> But it didn't have any effect<br> on me or my choice of work.<br> - And why's that?<br> - Because I grew up in an orphanage.<br> Thank you, Mr. Weissman,<br> for giving us all<br> a little something to think about.<br> Oh, Her Ladyship.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you.<br> Please, do sit down<br> and finish your supper.<br> Mrs. Wilson, a major crisis has arisen.<br> I have just found out...<br> that Mr. Weissman won't eat meat,<br> and I don't know what to do.<br> I can't tell Mrs. Croft.<br> I simply don't dare.<br> Everything's under control,<br> Your Ladyship.<br> Mr. Weissman's valet informed us<br> as soon as he arrived,<br> so we've prepared<br> a special version of the soup.<br> He can eat the fish<br> and the hors d'oeuvres,<br> and we'll have a Welsh rarebit<br> for the game course.<br> I don't know what we're going to do about<br> the entree, but we'll think of something.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.<br> Ten steps ahead as usual.<br> Which one of you<br> is Mr. Weissman's valet?<br> I am, Your Ladyship.<br> Are you, indeed?<br> Yes, heavens.<br> Um, thank you for your...<br> efficiency.<br> - You're all set, then.<br> - Yes, George?<br> Nothing, sir.<br> I should hope not.<br> I'm very hungry.<br> I was, uh, wondering, William,<br> if I could have a word<br> with you alone after dinner.<br> I can't leave my guests, can I?<br> You'll make that dog sick.<br> Isobel, did you know<br> that William and I...<br> are going into business<br> together in the Sudan?<br> - No, I didn't know that.<br> - It's quite exciting.<br> What's happened is apparently,<br> there are hundreds and hundreds<br> of Sudanese native soldiers,<br> entire regiments<br> wandering around the desert,<br> willy-nilly, without<br> any thing on their feet,<br> which causes some hardship, I imagine.<br> No, I grew up in Leicester.<br> - My father had a glove factory.<br> - Really?<br> One thing I do know is<br> how a glove should fit.<br> Really, darling. You're boring<br> poor Mr. Novello to death.<br> - No! - I think he's going<br> to explain everything to me...<br> and kind of show me<br> how it all works.<br> There's gonna be a pheasant hunt<br> in my picture.<br> There's a large market in modernizing<br> the armies in the Sudan...<br> and providing them with boots.<br> And then the old bag<br> just served it to all the servants.<br> I couldn't believe it.<br> Aren't you cold?<br> It's better than that kitchen.<br> Here. I thought<br> you could do with this.<br> Oh, that's kind, love.<br> Elsie, hello.<br> - Good evening, Your Lordship.<br> - We've got bags and guns and everything and no man.<br> If I give you the keys,<br> will you sort it out for me?<br> - Of course, Your Lordship.<br> - Thank you.<br> - We'll get your bags, sir.<br> - Thank you. That's very kind of you.<br> Good evening.<br> Right. In the boot, is it'?<br> Sorry, can I trouble you<br> for a light, please?<br> - You got that bag?<br> - Yeah.<br> Thank you. Good evening.<br> You mean you think he's<br> losing interest in that sort of thing?<br> Well, not just that.<br> The whole Empire.<br> I think he said<br> the steam's gone out of it.<br> William?<br> That's not true, is it...<br> that you think the Empire's finished?<br> - I've been what?<br> - Well, the Empire was finished after the war.<br> Well, because of the war.<br> It changed everything.<br> - Empire Leicester Square?<br> - Well, I don't care what's changed or not changed.<br> As long as our sons are spared<br> what you all went through.<br> Oh, not all.<br> You didn't fight, did you, William?<br> L did my bit.<br> Well, you made a lot of money,<br> but it's not quite the same thing as<br> charging into the cannon's mouth, is it?<br> Thank God for Raymond.<br> At least the family...<br> had one representative<br> in the front line.<br> Raymond, tell them how many times<br> you were mentioned in the dispatches.<br> - I forget.<br> - No, you don't. Come on.<br> - Is he being modest?<br> - Yes, he's being very modest.<br> What do you think<br> you're doing here'?<br> Mrs. Wilson asked me to tell you<br> that the others have arrived.<br> Good.<br> Lord Rupert Standish<br> and Mr. Blond are here, milady.<br> No, they're too late. They can<br> have a tray in the billiard room.<br> - They can join us later.<br> - Very good, milady.<br> - Is Rupert here?<br> Shall I go and say hello? - Yes.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> Face it. You're a younger son...<br> with the taste of marquees<br> and the income of a vicar.<br> Her mother likes you.<br> She does too.<br> Now, I know she's not<br> exactly a show-stopper...<br> - Her father's not keen on the idea.<br> - He'll come around.<br> "Have you met my daughter,<br> Lady Rupert Standish?"<br> He thinks I'm in it for the money.<br> Of course he does.<br> But you can't let that put you off.<br> He's much more of an obstacle<br> than you think.<br> Then you must overcome that,<br> mustn't you?<br> Her Ladyship asked if you would join her<br> in the drawing room when you've finished.<br> All right, ladies, off you go.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Gents, move down. Move down.<br> Louisa, look after Pip<br> for me, will you?<br> I wonder if we could have<br> a word or two later on, William?<br> Do you think so?<br> Ah, good, good.<br> - Jennings, could I...<br> - Certainly, sir.<br> There's more in here.<br> I'm just getting them.<br> I need all the knives there.<br> All the knives.<br> Come on, Maude.<br> Let's go and get the fish kettle.<br> Fred? Albert?<br> Ready?<br> - There he is.<br> - Who?<br> Lord Stockbridge's valet.<br> Apparently, he grew up in an orphanage.<br> Arthur said they made him<br> shout it down the table.<br> Makes you feel<br> sorry for him, really.<br> It's nothing to be<br> ashamed of. It's not his fault.<br> Would you like me to ask Lord Rupert<br> and Mr. Blond to join you, sir?<br> No, leave them be.<br> They can entertain the ladies.<br> Give Mr. Novello a rest.<br> Anthony, did I overhear you<br> at dinner saying...<br> - you were going into business with Sir William?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - Is it very old?<br> - Possibly, possibly.<br> If you need an expert<br> in changing money,<br> especially Africa,<br> I'm your man... expert.<br> Yes, the expert.<br> No, it's not here.<br> And Mr. Jennings is certain<br> he hasn't got it?<br> Oh, so he says.<br> But if it's a silver carving knife,<br> he must have it.<br> It's just gone in the wrong drawer<br> in the silver pantry.<br> - It wouldn't have been put in here.<br> - Well, that's what I told him.<br> How old would you say<br> that Mr. Stockbridge was?<br> Don't know. About 31, 32.<br> - Why?<br> - Oh, no reason.<br> I think I'll turn in.<br> We got an early start.<br> You can tell Mr. Jennings<br> we haven't got that knife.<br> Pleasant evening, milady?<br> Not really, no.<br> Had Lord Stockbridge on one side<br> boring for Britain,<br> and Freddie Nesbitt<br> on the other sucking up.<br> Oh, I'm worn out.<br> Ls there any more chocolate in that pot?<br> I'll go down and<br> make some more, milady.<br> Lewis'?<br> Lewis'?<br> I was looking for my maid.<br> She's just gone downstairs.<br> Can I help?<br> She's going to fetch me some chocolate, but<br> now I wonder whether I wouldn't prefer milk.<br> Would that be hot milk or cold?<br> You decide.<br> I couldn't say, milady.<br> Hot then, with something<br> to make it sweet.<br> You have your hands<br> in your pockets.<br> - Otherwise, I'll never sleep.<br> - Why?<br> Do you have trouble sleeping, milady?<br> I have a feeling<br> I might have trouble tonight.<br> I'll be wide awake at 1:00 a.m.,<br> bored to sobs.<br> Then we must try and think<br> of something to amuse you.<br> - Barnes. It's all right.<br> - Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.<br> No, I knew it. I knew William<br> would try something like this.<br> Well, of course he would. Fuck him!<br> - Short ares.<br> - And fuck this room!<br> I think you should<br> come with me tomorrow.<br> I'll just say I need you.<br> Oh, I got through<br> to the coast tonight.<br> Finally.<br> Is that clock right?<br> We got turned down by Una Merkel,<br> so... Sheehan's<br> pushing for a rewrite.<br> He thinks the part's too small.<br> It's a fucking Charlie Chan picture,<br> not a movie about a socialite.<br> So...<br> will I see you later?<br> I don't think I should risk it.<br> Do you?<br> Good night, sir.<br> Henry.<br> Don't forget those.<br> They'll think you don't care.<br> Oh. I must've taken<br> the wrong stairs.<br> You better not be seen up here.<br> - I'd better go down.<br> - Why?<br> There's no rush.<br> Since you're here now,<br> what about a drink?<br> What are you doing?<br> No!<br> Get off me!<br> Get off me!<br> Get off...<br> What?<br> What's this?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I came up the wrong staircase. I was<br> just waiting till the coast was clear.<br> Well, you better go down again<br> before anyone catches you.<br> Just a minute.<br> - What?<br> - Nothing.<br> - Do you want a drink?<br> - Sure.<br> So what do you make of the place?<br> Is this a well-run house,<br> would you say?<br> Do you think Sir William<br> would be good to work for?<br> No.<br> How long you been doing this?<br> - What?<br> - Valeting'?<br> About seven years.<br> I was a footman before that.<br> And working for Lord Stockbridge...<br> is that a promotion?<br> No.<br> I used to be with<br> the Earl of Flintshire.<br> - Then why did you move?<br> - 'Cause I felt like it.<br> Who's that?<br> - That's my mother.<br> - Where's she live?<br> She doesn't. That's why<br> they put me in an orphanage.<br> That's right. Sorry.<br> What happened to her?<br> What do you mean?<br> I mean, why did she die?<br> Was she young?<br> Was it in childbirth?<br> You're not very curious, are you?<br> Yeah, she was young.<br> She worked in a factory.<br> She had me. A little while later,<br> she died. End of story.<br> Then why didn't you say<br> she was a factory worker at dinner?<br> 'Cause I didn't fancy discussing my private<br> life with a table full of strangers.<br> I'm sorry if I spoke<br> out of turn, mate.<br> - Didn't mean to offend you.<br> - I'm not offended.<br> And don't call me "mate."<br> Well, I'll see you later.<br> I've got a date<br> with a hot glass of milk.<br> I shouldn't worry about it.<br> It goes with the territory.<br> Oh, look.<br> It's Mr. Novello.<br> Just think of him<br> sleeping downstairs.<br> I'm gonna have to watch you, my girl.<br> I can see that.<br> Her Ladyship says Mr. Weissman's a Hollywood producer.<br> He does the Charlie Chan films.<br> Yeah, I like those. I like<br> a bit of a fright in the cinema.<br> You could go with his valet.<br> He'd give you a fright.<br> You'd better keep your eye on him.<br> I think he's a queer one.<br> He's not from Scotland,<br> for a start.<br> At least not any part of it<br> that I know.<br> - What's Mrs. Nesbitt like?<br> - She's all right.<br> I feel a bit sorry<br> for her, really.<br> - Of course, it never works.<br> - What never works?<br> Well, when a man like that<br> marries beneath him,<br> he hasn't got the brains<br> to carry it off.<br> I think it's romantic<br> to marry for love.<br> Love'? Not him.<br> He's a nasty piece of work.<br> The Honorable Freddie Nesbitt.<br> That's a laugh.<br> No, it was her father's money<br> he was after.<br> It was less than he thought,<br> and now it's all spent,<br> all he's got to show for it<br> is a wife he's ashamed of.<br> And he's lost his job.<br> Wants Miss Isobel to put in a word<br> with Sir William.<br> - What's the matter?<br> - I never washed that shirt!<br> Oh, she's gonna kill me.<br> Do you think I could do it now?<br> - Do you want me to go with you?<br> - No.<br> I'll be all right.<br> What are you doing down here?<br> I'm supposed to wash<br> Lady Trentham's shirt for tomorrow.<br> There's a sink in the ironing room.<br> Is someone in there?<br> What are you doing here?<br> I just had to rinse this shirt out.<br> Should've knocked, shouldn't you?<br> Miss Trentham?<br> I was just washing a shirt<br> of Her Ladyship's.<br> I hope you found everything<br> you required.<br> Does she have to have marmalade?<br> Only Dorothy made too little of it last<br> January, and we've run out of the home made.<br> I don't suppose she'd care<br> for strawberry jam instead?<br> No, I thought not.<br> Oh, I was rather hoping for<br> a word with Mrs. Wilson.<br> Mrs. Wilson,<br> will you tell Jennings...<br> that we'll have the soup<br> after the fourth drive tomorrow.<br> And-And tell Mrs. Croft<br> to make sure it's hot.<br> It's been cold the last few weeks.<br> And more pepper in it.<br> Is that you?<br> Were you expecting someone else?<br> Seven hundred day today?<br> Well, lads, don't coach your guns,<br> even if they can't hit a barn door.<br> - Don't tell them where they're missing<br> unless they ask. - Lovely day.<br> - Jennings.<br> - I hope it holds for you, sir.<br> - Enjoy the shoot.<br> - Can a pheasant ever be dangerous?<br> - Dangerous?<br> - Do I have to worry about it attacking?<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - Right, draw your pegs.<br> - I'm gonna be cheering him on.<br> - Draw your pegs.<br> Here we are.<br> - Morning, Jennings.<br> - Are you shooting today, sir?<br> - I never shoot.<br> - Oh.<br> You see,<br> I'm-I'm starving.<br> Where have you been?<br> Sorry.<br> Oh, they always send up<br> a good breakfast here.<br> I'll say that for Sylvia.<br> She's not at all mean in that way.<br> Oh, dear. Bought marmalade.<br> Dear me, I call that very feeble.<br> Well, I suppose<br> one can't have everything.<br> Mary, I don't think<br> I'll wear that shirt after all.<br> The other one's warmer.<br> That's all I care about.<br> Ooh, yummy...<br> Yummy, yummy, yummy.<br> What do you mean,<br> you're going shooting?<br> Mr. Weissman wants me to accompany him.<br> Nothing wrong in that.<br> But what for? You're not loading.<br> He hasn't got a gun.<br> - He might need something.<br> - What could he need?<br> Yeah, we know the very idea of service<br> is offensive to you, George.<br> But there's no need<br> to take it out on the rest of us.<br> Please forgive our ill manners,<br> Mr. Weissman.<br> I think he's got<br> something to hide, that one.<br> We all have something to hide,<br> Mr. Meredith.<br> Would you like to<br> get changed now, miss?<br> - He won't do it.<br> - Who won't do what?<br> My father.<br> He won't give Freddie a job.<br> I spoke to him last night,<br> and he said he'd think about it.<br> But this morning, he says it isn't<br> up to him, when, of course, it is.<br> - Why not?<br> - I don't know.<br> Something to do with<br> why Freddie was sacked.<br> But I can't get a straight answer<br> out of either of them.<br> Well, you've done your best.<br> Mr. Nesbitt can't ask for more than that now, can he?<br> But he can, much more!<br> He says he's going to tell him.<br> Do you think he will'?<br> I don't know. He says Daddy<br> will give him a job to keep him quiet.<br> Will you say something?<br> To Mr. Nesbitt?<br> To Daddy.<br> Really, miss, why do you think<br> I can make a difference?<br> Will you?<br> I think you should wear<br> your warm underwear today.<br> Neary<br> That's mine.<br> Oh, God! It's on its way.<br> Damn!<br> Bloody gun's no good.<br> I told you not to bring this one.<br> - Blast.<br> - I think I pricked that one.<br> I-I'm pretty sure I pricked it.<br> Bugged<br> Blast it!<br> Oh, damn!<br> - Are you all right, sir?<br> - No, I'm not!<br> God, where the bloody hell<br> did that come from?<br> - It's nicked you, sir.<br> - It's nicked me.<br> - What cretin did that?<br> - I don't know, sir.<br> Find Strutt. Ask him<br> if he knows who's responsible.<br> And if he knows, tell him to send<br> the gun back to the bloody house.<br> Everybody knows the desperate situation<br> we're in, but nobody seems to care.<br> Oh, there you are.<br> Did you find one?<br> - Well?<br> - Don't look at me.<br> If I so much as open my mouth on<br> the subject, it'll make things worse.<br> - I've already tried.<br> - Jennings says the car's ready.<br> Oh, goody. I'm starving.<br> I do love.<br> - What are you wearing?<br> - Why'? Don't you like it?<br> - You bought it.<br> - Did I?<br> Oh, how extraordinary of me.<br> Come on. Better get going.<br> - Where's that wretched Mabel?<br> - Has anyone checked her outfit?<br> She's probably in black velvet<br> with a feather in her hair.<br> She's in the morning room<br> looking perfectly normal.<br> - Don't be such a snob, Aunt Constance.<br> - Me?<br> I haven't a snobbish bone<br> in my body.<br> Oh, Mr. Meredith.<br> - Is Mr. Stockbridge in?<br> - Search me.<br> Oh. Mr. Stockbridge.<br> I'm sorry to disturb you.<br> I was just making<br> my routine inspection.<br> So, uh, how are you settling in<br> with Lord Stockbridge?<br> I'm sorry?<br> How are you settling in<br> with Lord Stockbridge?<br> I know that you haven't<br> been with him for long.<br> Not long, no.<br> I'm afraid smoking<br> isn't allowed up here.<br> I hope you're finding everything to make<br> His Lordship's stay more comfortable.<br> I hope we haven't forgotten anything.<br> I can't believe you forget much,<br> Mrs. Wilson.<br> No.<br> Not much.<br> Well, I'll leave you to your book.<br> You know... Bang! Whoof!<br> You should be more<br> selective about the people you invite.<br> Well, I've got a good appetite.<br> Yes.<br> It's very muddy,<br> so watch where you step.<br> Terribly muddy here. Do watch.<br> Do you see what I'm saying?<br> I've been noticing it.<br> Doesn't this look lovely?<br> They really have done well.<br> Now do go in and have a drink.<br> I can tell you, Raymond, it's<br> a bloody awful thing to have happened.<br> - Oh, God, Louisa.<br> - Oh! Oh, I say.<br> Two inches to my right I'd have<br> been dead. I've just been shot.<br> - What?<br> - Yes, that's right.<br> Oh, yes, please.<br> - What happened to your ear?<br> - Some idiot shot me.<br> - I was a terrible shot.<br> - Did you have fun?<br> - I don't think you realise how serious this is.<br> - Of course I do.<br> Why can't you get<br> your sisters to help?<br> Darling, do you think I haven't tried'?<br> You know what they're like.<br> Well, I know they couldn't care less<br> if we go under.<br> Why should they care, as long as their dressmakers<br> are busy and their dinners are on time?<br> - Wait a minute. There's a queue here.<br> - Shh. Shh.<br> Shut the door, for heaven's sake.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's only Lewis and Dorothy.<br> If any of the men get found up here,<br> they get sacked on the spot.<br> Worse luck.<br> So don't tell me,<br> you're a convent girl.<br> Or is that<br> Presbyterian modesty?<br> - Is the water hot?<br> - Not really.<br> No, it won't be<br> till the guns get back.<br> I'd better get in yours.<br> Her Ladyship says that Sir William<br> loves his shooting.<br> Yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door,<br> but he does love it.<br> It's quite sweet, really.<br> - Elsie.<br> - Yeah?<br> Last night...<br> What?<br> No, I shouldn't say.<br> Yes, you should.<br> What?<br> Well,<br> when I went down<br> to wash that shirt,<br> I think I saw him<br> in the ironing room.<br> He was with<br> one of the kitchen maids.<br> - No, that wouldn't have been him.<br> - I think it was.<br> He came down the passage a minute later,<br> and I don't see how...<br> No, it wasn't him.<br> You weren't serious<br> last night, were you?<br> I'm afraid I was, old boy.<br> I was going to tell you next week,<br> but since you mentioned it...<br> I don't think you've grasped quite what it'll do to the<br> whole project, and in particular what it'll do to me.<br> - It can't be as black as all that, can it?<br> - Yes, it bloody well is.<br> I'm sorry to hear that,<br> but business is business.<br> - I'm not a charity commissioner, you know.<br> - William, I'm begging you.<br> Damn it!<br> Oh, dear.<br> - I'll clear that up.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Arthur, go and get a bucket.<br> - Have you a cloth?<br> - Under the table.<br> Seems very nervous.<br> We'll have that<br> cleaned for you at the house.<br> Terrified the life out of me.<br> I borrowed it from Lewis.<br> Shot, frightened to death.<br> I think it's left me deaf.<br> You know how you said Sir William<br> could've had his pick...<br> between Lady Sylvia<br> and Lady Stockbridge?<br> - Aye.<br> - Well, I asked Her Ladyship about it.<br> She said they cut cards for him.<br> - No!<br> - I know.<br> I can't believe it either.<br> Do you suppose it was a joke?<br> Well, I wouldn't be too sure.<br> You know what I heard'?<br> Oh, just listen to me.<br> - What? - Why do we spend our lives<br> living through them?<br> I mean, look at poor old Lewis.<br> If her own mother had a heart attack, she'd think it<br> was less important than one of Lady Sylvia's farts.<br> You must know.<br> You can't fool me.<br> If there's one thing I don't<br> look for in a maid, it's discretion.<br> Except with my own secrets, of course.<br> Well, I don't know much, milady,<br> but apparently he was counting<br> on Sir William for an investment...<br> and had guaranteed his interest,<br> whatever that means.<br> Anyway, Mr. Barnes,<br> the commander's valet<br> he said he wanted<br> to leave at once,<br> but Lady Lavinia's persuaded him to stay until<br> tomorrow to make less of a thing of it.<br> Oh, thank heavens.<br> Lewis told me you were wearing white.<br> White? She must be mad.<br> I never wear white.<br> I thought it was a little odd.<br> By the way, for God's sake,<br> don't rub him up tonight.<br> - I don't know what you mean.<br> - You know exactly what I mean.<br> He's in a filthy mood<br> with everyone.<br> He's talking about<br> stopping your allowance.<br> But it's for life.<br> That was settled. He can't do that.<br> Just you watch him.<br> He's absolutely spoiling for a fight.<br> So if you'll take my advice,<br> you won't give him one.<br> Now, that you can be<br> discreet about.<br> Thank you.<br> Goodness, isn't it pretty here?<br> The house has such lovely position.<br> The best view's<br> from the old water tower.<br> You might well<br> walk up there tomorrow.<br> Do you really have to<br> go back to London?<br> I am afraid so, Raymond.<br> When you're ruined,<br> there's so much to do.<br> Yes, there is, isn't there?<br> Moan, moan, moan.<br> Would anybody care for<br> a game of bridge after dinner?<br> Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind.<br> Who else?<br> Louisa, how about you?<br> Oh, I don't think so.<br> I've rather gone off cards.<br> I've never been very lucky with them.<br> Me too.<br> Mr. Weissman, tell us about<br> the film you're going to make.<br> Oh, sure. It's called Charlie Chan<br> in London. It's a detective story.<br> - Set in London?<br> - Well, not really.<br> Most of it takes place at<br> a shooting party in a country house,<br> sort of like this one, actually.<br> A murder in the middle of the night.<br> A lot of guests for the weekend.<br> Everyone's a suspect.<br> That sort of thing.<br> How horrid.<br> And who turns out to have done it?<br> I couldn't tell you that.<br> It would spoil it for you.<br> Oh, but none of us will see it.<br> Are you thinking of<br> making it here, Mr. Weissman'?<br> Uh, no, we're going to shoot it<br> in Hollywood, on the back lot.<br> But since I was in England, I thought I would<br> do a little research on country living...<br> and Ivor was kind enough<br> to arrange it for me.<br> Mmm, no.<br> William arranged it for you.<br> - Are you interested in films, sir?<br> - Not likely.<br> Why shouldn't I be interested in films?<br> You don't know<br> what I'm interested in.<br> Well, I know you're interested in money<br> and fiddling with your guns,<br> but when it comes to anything else,<br> I'm stumped.<br> That is not fair. Bill is...<br> Elsie.<br> Elsie, what's...<br> It's not as if I didn't know.<br> So we can all play bridge.<br> - All playing?<br> - Who's going to play bridge? Are they going to play?<br> Where's Rupert?<br> - Rupert!<br> - Coming.<br> - I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out of turn.<br> - You didn't actually see?<br> So what's going to happen to Elsie?<br> - She'll be lucky if they don't boot her out before morning.<br> - You should've seen it.<br> She has been here a long time.<br> Shall I tell you<br> what that means to them? Bugger all.<br> Please, Mr. Meredith.<br> There are ladies present.<br> Where, exactly, is Sir William now?<br> He's still in the library.<br> He won't be out again tonight.<br> Oh, Dorothy.<br> - Mr. Meredith, may I ask what is going on?<br> - Uh, we were just...<br> George, will you please join me in<br> the drawing room as soon as possible.<br> - Mr. Probert, kindly take everybody<br> back downstairs. - Certainly.<br> Dorothy, I'm especially<br> surprised at you.<br> Come along, ladies. Come along.<br> Is it true, then?<br> Has Elsie really been sacked?<br> - Lady Trentham.<br> - Well, luck of the draw.<br> - Freddie, I'd like to...<br> - Darling, we've just cut.<br> - Ivor, darling.<br> - Thank you.<br> Would it be awful of me<br> to ask you to play something...<br> to cheer us all up a bit?<br> - Of course not.<br> - Thank you.<br> So sweet.<br> I've booked the first passage home.<br> I'll be living on the phone till I set<br> sail. I have to be in London tomorrow.<br> If you prefer to stay,<br> I can take a train.<br> - I'll give you a lift in my car.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> You're providing a lot<br> of entertainment for nothing.<br> Morris, I'm used to it.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Music moves on.<br> - Funny old evening, hmm?<br> Oh!<br> You're not going to stand over<br> my shoulder and watch me, please.<br> You'll put me off.<br> He's rather a big success, isn't he?<br> Huge. It's absolutely ridiculous.<br> Do you think he'll be as long<br> as he usually is?<br> I think he's rather wonderful.<br> - Hmm?<br> - I think he's rather wonderful.<br> Well, I have only seen one.<br> I thought<br> you weren't drinking any more.<br> I don't think we should be doing this.<br> Oh, come on.<br> I don't know. It's just...<br> I mean, how could she<br> let him touch her?<br> - You sound as if you don't like him.<br> - You'd be surprised.<br> - All right, surprise me.<br> - Maybe I will.<br> I saw him in The Lodger.<br> But I've never heard him sing.<br> Will you, um, excuse me for a minute?<br> - You don't need my help?<br> - No, we're fine.<br> Oh, my Lord.<br> - It seems to be much more<br> than just background music,<br> somehow or other.<br> Ivor, darling, it was lovely.<br> Thank you.<br> Anthony.<br> Shh. It's the commander.<br> - Oh.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Sir.<br> Uh, carry on.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I brought you some coffee.<br> If I wanted coffee,<br> I'd have rung for it.<br> Leave that.<br> Give me some whiskey.<br> I thought you might<br> need a drink...<br> and some company.<br> Well, that's really<br> very kind of you.<br> Give me just a sec.<br> Awfully long repertoire.<br> We've run out of milk, Mr. Jennings.<br> - Won't be a moment.<br> - Hmm.<br> Desperate for a fag.<br> Where's Mr. Weissman's man?<br> - He's missing the music.<br> - Shh.<br> What are you doing?<br> Dorothy, get back to work.<br> Excuse me, but Dorothy's<br> under my jurisdiction as well,<br> and I say she can listen to<br> a spot of music if she likes.<br> - Excuse me. Where's the telephone?<br> - Oh. I'm sorry, sir.<br> Uh, it's just over there, sir.<br> Don't. Don't. Don't. Please don't<br> encourage him. He'll just go on and on.<br> Oh, you're still here.<br> - I thought that...<br> - Yeah, well, appearances can be deceptive, can't they?<br> Elsie.<br> Good night.<br> Scotch and soda, please, Jennings.<br> He gave you that<br> for your birthday, did he?<br> Hmm?<br> He gave you that<br> for your birthday, William did?<br> Yeah, I've got a call<br> booked for California.<br> California.<br> It's never going to stop.<br> Oh, Freddie, we gave up on you.<br> We waited as long as we could.<br> - Do you think William's still in the library?<br> - Where have you been?<br> - Hmm? I suppose.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - That's none of your bloody business.<br> - What are we going to do?<br> Who played the nine?<br> - Well, I could try and fetch him.<br> - Oh, would you?<br> He's always preferred you to me.<br> Yes, I'd be delighted.<br> Today is not my day.<br> If that's what you call a moment,<br> I'd like to see what happens<br> when you take a real break.<br> Here. Did yours as well.<br> Before the rush starts.<br> Thank you.<br> Where have you been?<br> It's fine, it's fine.<br> William?<br> Oh, God, Bill.<br> Come here,<br> you horrid little dirty thing.<br> Bill!<br> - Dear God!<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Louisa!<br> Isobel? Isobel?<br> George. Excuse me, sir.<br> Jennings.<br> Oh, my dear.<br> Darling? Darling?<br> Could you ask Jennings about the salts?<br> Could somebody get<br> a glass of water, please?<br> - Keep everybody out of this room.<br> - Yes, sir, certainly.<br> - Over here. Louisa.<br> - Bill.<br> - Louisa, just sit and be quiet.<br> - But...<br> Mummy?<br> Mummy?<br> - Is she all right?<br> - Everything's fine.<br> Sylvia.<br> - Well, tell Mr. Warner...<br> - Excuse me. I need that telephone.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm on the telephone.<br> I'm on a call to California.<br> Hello? Yes, would you<br> connect me with the police station?<br> I'm looking for a kind<br> of realistic Charlie Chan movie.<br> This isn't out of the question.<br> We should try to do this.<br> It has to be better. We can't do<br> the same old shit over and over again.<br> Alan Mowbray... I like that.<br> I mean, that's a butler.<br> These people here<br> look like Alan Mowbray.<br> I mean, they're sort of tall,<br> and they don't say too much.<br> And they have fucking<br> British accents, right?<br> They talk like they're from England.<br> - Good evening. We've been expecting you.<br> - Is Ray Milland British?<br> - Yes, good evening. This is Constable Dexter...<br> - You must be the police.<br> - Yes. How do you do, ma'am? I'm Inspector Thom...<br> - I'm Lady Sylvia McCordle.<br> We haven't moved him. I've gathered<br> everyone. Come straight through.<br> Certainly, ma'am, yes.<br> Oh, don't worry about him.<br> He's just an American staying with us.<br> I'll tell you who we all are. Then we can all<br> go to bed and leave you with poor William.<br> Yes, indeed. Shall I introduce myself?<br> I'm Inspector Thom...<br> - This is my aunt, Lady Trentham.<br> - Ah, yes, the Countess of Trentham.<br> I served with your husband on a...<br> My brother-in-law Lord Stockbridge.<br> Lady Stockbridge.<br> - Jennings, please, would you remove that vile animal?<br> - Certainly, milady.<br> Uh, Mrs. Nesbitt.<br> Mr. Nesbitt.<br> - Ivor Novello, who I'm sure needs no introduction.<br> - Of course. Mr. Novello, a...<br> No, wait. Would you like to speak<br> to the servants tonight, Inspector?<br> - Inspector Thom...<br> - He ought to speak to Probert, my husband's valet.<br> Tell him to come up.<br> Now, where was I?<br> - Isobel McCordle, my daughter.<br> - Charlie Chan is in London.<br> He's not in California.<br> They're talking to me about rewrites<br> about the part of the Cockney maid,<br> and she's running in<br> and saying all these things.<br> Look, I'm here.<br> They don't talk.<br> The butlers and maids,<br> they stand, they watch.<br> They serve.<br> They do things.<br> What about Claudette Colbert? She's<br> British, isn't she? She sounds British.<br> Is she, like, affected,<br> or is she British?<br> Oh, Dorothy, would you take...<br> Um, Well, I...<br> Go on, spit it out.<br> - The police would like<br> to see you for a moment. - Me?<br> No, Mrs. Croft.<br> Mr. Probert.<br> Me?<br> Why?<br> Oh, Well,<br> I-I don't know<br> what I can tell them.<br> George, would you go and see if anything<br> more is required in the red drawing room?<br> Yes, sir.<br> I don't see the point<br> in the rest of you waiting up.<br> What about me, Mr. Jennings?<br> You can go as soon as<br> the police release you.<br> That'll be sometime tomorrow.<br> Until then,<br> you can stay in your room.<br> I'm not contagious, you know.<br> Nobody's going anywhere<br> Those of you with remaining duties,<br> see to them as quickly as you can.<br> Otherwise...<br> good night, everyone.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> - Good night, sir.<br> - Mr. Jennings.<br> - Yes, Mr. Weissman'?<br> I have a confession to make.<br> Right, but I think<br> it's clear it's the valet who did it.<br> No, because the valet<br> has access to everybody.<br> No, the valet isn't the butler.<br> No, there's one butler, and there 's lots<br> of valets running all over the place.<br> He takes care of people.<br> He's in their rooms at night.<br> He could do it. I mean,<br> the valet easily could have done it.<br> Pull yourself together, Mr. Probert.<br> Try and be a bit patient.<br> They'll be along in a minute.<br> Couldn't I just make him<br> a little more comfortable, sir?<br> - Please?<br> - Have a heart, Inspector.<br> No, it wouldn't be wise, sir. We shouldn't<br> have to wait too much longer now.<br> Oh, I don't think it'd do any harm.<br> Ohh!<br> Well, you see, this is why we have<br> rules and regulations, isn't it?<br> What is it, Dexter?<br> Well, only that there doesn't seem<br> to be much blood, sir.<br> - Is that everything, milord?<br> - Yes, thank you, Parks.<br> - I think perhaps you should try and get some sleep.<br> - It's so unfair!<br> Nobody liked him.<br> - It's terrible.<br> - Oh, do stop sniveling.<br> Anyone would think you were Italian.<br> Christ.<br> Will you not let me help you<br> with your frock, milady'?<br> No, I can manage.<br> - Then I'll say good night, milady.<br> - Wait, wait.<br> Thank you, milady.<br> What is it?<br> Please tell me you haven't<br> come with condolences.<br> No.<br> - I was just wondering if you wanted some com...<br> - What?<br> I said, I was just<br> wondering if you wanted some company<br> Well, I suppose life must go on.<br> Unhook me.<br> No, there's another one.<br> You'll never get it off like that.<br> I'm really sorry about everything.<br> Don't feel sorry for me.<br> Pity that poor Dorothy.<br> She's got all<br> the early morning teas to do,<br> and the breakfast trays.<br> And she's got to get Miss Isobel to the dining<br> room and see if she can find anything in black.<br> She's the one who needs your sympathy.<br> I'm well out of it.<br> I would think Miss Isobel<br> might stay in bed tomorrow.<br> Unmarried girls don't have breakfast<br> trays. Not in this house.<br> I wish I could help.<br> You can't.<br> George says Mr. Novello was in on it.<br> And Sir William.<br> The point is, that Henry Denton,<br> he's an actor.<br> An actor?<br> He's playing a butler in the next Charlie Chan.<br> Wanted to make it authentic.<br> I'd say the joke was on Lady Sylvia.<br> I hope he don't model<br> his performance on Mr. Jennings,<br> or he'll be too squiffy<br> to remember his lines.<br> Ah, Mrs. Croft, isn't it?<br> I wonder if I could...<br> Ah, yes.<br> Have a few words with you.<br> - I'm Inspector Thom...<br> - Oh, I haven't got time for this now.<br> I'm doing the breakfast.<br> It wouldn't take much time. Perhaps<br> you have a room where we could speak.<br> Oh, I suppose<br> you'd better come to my room.<br> Bertha, I'm leaving you in charge.<br> Dorothy, make sure those menus<br> go up on Her Ladyship's tray.<br> And get that filthy dog out of here.<br> Honestly, these days the countryside's<br> getting more dangerous than Piccadilly.<br> But why one of the knives<br> from the silver pantry?<br> Doesn't make sense.<br> He must have forgotten to bring one.<br> When you think of<br> what they have to carry about...<br> all those jemmies and torches<br> and skeleton keys...<br> it's a miracle anyone<br> ever gets burgled at all.<br> Oh, it's glacial in here.<br> Get my fur, will you?<br> Anyway, it wasn't in<br> the silver pantry.<br> It's been missing<br> since yesterday.<br> Obviously William had it.<br> And when the fellow surprised him<br> there it was,<br> on the table<br> as handy as you like.<br> Are any of the others getting up<br> for breakfast? The women, I mean.<br> I think Lady Lavinia may be.<br> That settles it. Come back<br> at half past 8:00. I'll get dressed.<br> It's the greatest bore, of course,<br> but I don't want<br> to miss anything.<br> When I came back last night,<br> I found this on my dressing table.<br> What is it?<br> "This is your final warning.<br> If I've not<br> received an offer..."<br> Freddie.<br> What a stupid idiot.<br> Well, at least he's off your back now.<br> There's no one to tell.<br> At least no one's who's gonna<br> give him a job to shut him up.<br> Oh, now,<br> he's quite the bonny lad, isn't he?<br> What's he up to these days,<br> this one, eh?<br> He's dead.<br> I don't know what I can tell you.<br> Shouldn't you be looking<br> for signs of a break-in?<br> Mrs. Croft, I understand no one has served Sir<br> William longer than you have. Is that true?<br> I'd better be off.<br> Might not see you again.<br> I'm only staying till<br> the police give the nod.<br> But, Elsie,<br> you're not in any difficulty,<br> are you?<br> What, apart from having<br> no home and no job?<br> Nah.<br> There's no worries there.<br> Yes, I was forgetting.<br> You were much cleverer<br> than I was.<br> You'll be fine.<br> I wonder what Lady Sylvia<br> will do now.<br> If I were her, I'd set up<br> in London as a glamorous widow...<br> with all the gentlemen<br> chasin' me for my money.<br> I wouldn't.<br> I grew up in London.<br> - Is that where the orphanage was?<br> - On the edge. lsleworth.<br> - And you don't get homesick?<br> - I don't think you get homesick if you've never had a home.<br> You heard about Mr. Weissman's valet?<br> Turns out he's a fraud.<br> - He isn't Scottish at all.<br> - No!<br> I could've told you that.<br> Who is he, then?<br> Do you think he's the murderer?<br> It's worse than that.<br> He's an actor.<br> Yes, I want you to wake him up.<br> How else do you suggest<br> I talk to him?<br> Yes. Right.<br> Well, what'd he say?<br> What, he's talking about<br> Clara Bow again?<br> Listen, you tell Sheehan I think<br> Clara Bow is a really nice person,<br> and she's not coming within<br> ten miles of my picture.<br> I don't want her<br> in the fucking movie.<br> There is one thing. The bastard's<br> death may have saved my bacon.<br> For God's sake, be quiet.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Arthur.<br> - Oh, are these tomatoes?<br> - Yes, milady.<br> That's exactly what I want.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, dear.<br> Have you heard?<br> It's too tiresome. That frightful<br> inspector won't let anyone leave.<br> So we're to be treated to another day of<br> Mr. Weissman shouting down the telephone.<br> He has some problems with his work<br> in Los Angeles, I'm afraid.<br> Well, I must say,<br> he conducts his affairs very oddly.<br> Coming downstairs just now, I thought I'd<br> been transported to a bar in Marseilles.<br> Jennings? Excuse me. I'm sorry.<br> I'm expecting<br> a really important telephone call.<br> - Will you get me the second it comes through?<br> - Very good, sir.<br> And I'd like, uh, oh,<br> tomato and eggs. Thank you.<br> Of course, sir, but...<br> perhaps you would prefer to<br> choose for yourself, sir?<br> What do you mean,<br> like cafeteria style?<br> The Englishman is never<br> waited on at breakfast.<br> Really?<br> Well, that's interesting.<br> Because an American is.<br> Wow.<br> I'm going to make a note of that.<br> Good morning.<br> I'd like some coffee, Jennings.<br> There it is.<br> - You haven't made a lot of friends.<br> - Ah.<br> Good. Good morning, ladies, gents.<br> Um, I wonder...<br> Excuse me.<br> Uh, will Lady Sylvia<br> be coming down soon?<br> I shouldn't think so.<br> She has breakfast in her room.<br> Then she usually goes for a ride.<br> Yes, but she won't be doing that<br> this morning, will she?<br> Well, I see.<br> Well, in that case,<br> I wonder, Lady Trentham,<br> if you would be kind enough<br> to join us for some questions.<br> If you wish, Inspector.<br> I'm afraid I won't be much help,<br> but I suppose on a day like this<br> we all have to pull our weight.<br> Mr. Denton made<br> a right chump out of Mr. Jennings.<br> Never mind that.<br> Did you hear about Sir William?<br> Apparently he wasn't stabbed after all.<br> Well, I mean, he was,<br> but that's not why he died.<br> He was poisoned.<br> That's what killed him.<br> The inspector told Mrs. Croft.<br> They don't know why the killer stabbed him<br> as well, but he must've been dead already.<br> That's why there was no blood.<br> Dead bodies don't bleed, you know.<br> Trust Sir William<br> to be murdered twice.<br> Of course he wasn't murdered.<br> Not that sort of murder.<br> Some ruffian broke in...<br> thinking the library was empty.<br> Sir William surprised him<br> and paid the price for it.<br> And very tragic it is too.<br> I can't see that, Mr. Jennings.<br> I don't think ruffians go about poisoning<br> people and then stabbing the corpses.<br> Apart from anything else,<br> they're usually in a hurry<br> to get away, aren't they?<br> What are you suggesting?<br> - I'm not suggesting anything. It's just<br> - Just what?<br> Well, it looks to me like Sir William<br> was killed deliberately, that's all.<br> No wonder they're not<br> letting any of us go.<br> Tough luck on whoever's<br> got any secrets to hide.<br> Now they've canceled the shooting,<br> muggins here has got to pull a luncheon<br> for God knows how many out of the hat.<br> - Is Her Ladyship back yet?<br> - No.<br> Then she'll have to take<br> what she gets.<br> Why would anyone<br> want to kill Sir William?<br> Well, he wasn't exactly<br> Father Christmas.<br> Get on with your work.<br> And take that filthy dog out of here.<br> He made a few enemies<br> in his time, that's all.<br> What do you mean, enemies?<br> When?<br> Is this before the war, Mrs. Croft,<br> when you were a factory worker?<br> I was not a factory worker.<br> I was never a factory worker.<br> I was a cook in one of his factories.<br> He had two in lsleworth and two<br> in Twickenham, and all full of girls.<br> So you can imagine.<br> Wasn't that risky with factory girls?<br> Suppose they complained?<br> Who to, exactly?<br> But what if they got,<br> you know, in trouble'?<br> - What sort of trouble?<br> - Here, take these. Whites only, all right?<br> Didn't happen very often.<br> When it did, he arranged<br> to have it adopted.<br> But what if you didn't<br> want it adopted?<br> - Say you wanted to keep it.<br> - Then you got kicked out, lost your job.<br> You can take my word for it,<br> he was a hard-hearted, randy old sod.<br> Ah, come in, Miss Maceach...<br> - I'm Inspector Thom...<br> - This is all too tiresome and absurd.<br> He's making the most dreadful fuss.<br> If you don't mind, I would like<br> to ask the young lady some questions.<br> Well, I'm not leaving,<br> if that's what you think.<br> Well, does it bother you<br> if Lady Trentham stays?<br> Why should it?<br> - Sir, someone's traipsed a load of mud in down here.<br> - Not now, Dexter, please.<br> I understood there was some...<br> difficulty between the late<br> Sir William McCordle and your employer.<br> This is too vulgar to be believed.<br> I wasn't aware of that, sir.<br> They got on well as far as I could see.<br> - You were not conscious...<br> - Inspector, there's a broken coffee cup down here.<br> Dexter, they have people to clear these<br> things up. You get on with your own job.<br> So you were not aware<br> of any trouble...<br> over the matter of an allowance?<br> An allowance, I might add, that<br> Sir William's death has now made secure.<br> What sort of an allowance<br> would that be, sir?<br> Ah, there you are.<br> Have you got enough light?<br> Black on black? We don't want you<br> going blind on top of everything else.<br> They've got to be done,<br> Mr. Jennings,<br> but the outside staff<br> need them for the funeral.<br> I'm sorry that this business with Elsie<br> has landed you with so much work.<br> That's what comes<br> of being so reliable.<br> - Never mind me.<br> - Hmm.<br> Mr. Jennings, have you...<br> have you spoken to the police again?<br> Not yet, no.<br> I suppose they have to ask<br> their questions, don't they have to?<br> Well, yes.<br> Will they be talking to all of us?<br> I shouldn't think so, no.<br> Well, I'll leave you to it, then.<br> Mr. Jennings.<br> You know... You know<br> I'd say anything you want me to.<br> - What?<br> - Anything at all.<br> I don't care what I tell them, if it'll<br> help you. Y-Y-You know that, don't you?<br> You've only to ask.<br> So, let me, uh, let me pour you<br> a cup of tea, eh?<br> Yes, thank you. Would you mind<br> putting the milk in afterward?<br> Of course.<br> Of course.<br> Don't know what came over me. I usually put<br> the milk in after, but on that occasion...<br> - Sir.<br> - Not now, thank you.<br> So sorry.<br> Mrs. Inspector Thompson prefers the milk in<br> first, so I get used to pouring it for her.<br> I don't know why. Some nonsense about<br> bacteria. You know what women are like...<br> Well, what wives are like.<br> No, she's a funny old...<br> Sugar?<br> No, thank you.<br> Of course they'll give her<br> a good reference.<br> Otherwise they'd have to explain<br> why they're giving her a bad one.<br> - Mr. Parks.<br> - Robert.<br> Robert, then.<br> It's just...<br> last night when you said<br> you'd surprise me,<br> you didn't mean anything by it, did you?<br> Why?<br> Don't you like surprises?<br> Where shall we begin? Yes, now...<br> Oh, Mr. Stockbridge.<br> By now I assume<br> you are all aware...<br> that, uh, Mr. Denton has<br> been playing a trick on us...<br> by posing as a valet.<br> Since Sir William<br> was aware of the plan,<br> it is not for me<br> or anyone else to criticise it.<br> However, it does leave us with some<br> adjustments to make for this evening.<br> Um, Arthur, you will take over<br> dressing Mr. Weissman.<br> That leaves us the problem of Mr. Novello, and<br> I really don't want to ask you, Mr. Probert.<br> - I don't mind, Mr. Jennings.<br> - Oh, no, no. You've got enough on your plate.<br> I'll do him, if you like.<br> Oh, that's very generous of you,<br> Mr. Stockbridge.<br> I suppose I could always<br> do it myself, of course.<br> It's no trouble.<br> It's only for a night or two.<br> Good. Splendid.<br> That's settled, then.<br> And I think we can leave Mr. Denton<br> to dress himself.<br> "The bastard's death<br> may have saved my bacon."<br> - What do you think he meant by that?<br> - Isn't it obvious?<br> Is it'?<br> Well, perhaps he meant that the<br> investment that Sir William had agreed...<br> would probably have to<br> be paid now... Sir.<br> What about that low shot that nearly<br> killed him that morning they were out?<br> - Sir.<br> - What is it?<br> We haven't dusted those things<br> for fingerprints yet.<br> Good.<br> Do you think that shot might have<br> been intended for Sir William?<br> - Well, it nearly took his ear off.<br> - Hmm.<br> Mm-hmm. Well, thank you, Mr. Barnes.<br> You've been most helpful.<br> Perhaps you'd be good enough to ask<br> Commander Meredith to join us just now.<br> You-You won't tell him what I said,<br> will you, Inspector Thomas?<br> Thompson.<br> It's Inspector Thom...<br> Never mind.<br> Just go and fetch him up, please.<br> Sir.<br> - We've only got this.<br> - I don't think mine's bothered. She hasn't got any black here.<br> We've got some new ones.<br> You're a lech. You know that?<br> - George?<br> - They're coming in a minute.<br> The dressing bell's just gone.<br> I'm going out of my mind.<br> I've read all my magazines twice.<br> You couldn't pinch something<br> out of the library for me?<br> I don't care if it's Horse and Hound,<br> as long as I haven't read it.<br> Well, we are honored.<br> In case you've forgotten,<br> this is the servants area, sir.<br> Yours is at the top of the stairs<br> behind that door, sir.<br> Barnes, it was just a...<br> - I wanted to explain.<br> - No explanation necessary, Mr. Denton.<br> If you'll excuse us, some of us have<br> got real work to do. Come on, Arthur.<br> The accent was a dead give away,<br> you know. We all knew.<br> Robert, I was just having fun.<br> Well, then perhaps you'd better enjoy<br> your fun in the drawing room, sir.<br> They're afraid you'll repeat things,<br> be indiscreet.<br> But I'm very discreet.<br> In Hollywood, that's what<br> I'm known for... my discretion.<br> Tell Rupert if you like.<br> He won't give you any money.<br> No, you're<br> completely misunderstanding me.<br> And Mummy wouldn't pay<br> five pounds to save me...<br> Oh, my poor darling.<br> Come here. Come on.<br> Look, please don't think that I'm<br> enjoying this. All I wanted was a job.<br> My checkbook's downstairs.<br> I'll give you a check after dinner.<br> I'm trying to find my man Parks.<br> Have you seen him?<br> Uh, no.<br> I've been with the police.<br> You look as if<br> you've had rather a pasting.<br> They kept on and on<br> about that low shot yesterday.<br> They wouldn't let it go.<br> - I told them it was nothing to do with me.<br> - I'm sure you did.<br> - But another time, Anthony,<br> try to be less greedy. Parks! - What?<br> Attend to Mr. Novello first.<br> I want a word with Her Ladyship.<br> Very well, milord.<br> - What?<br> - I saw you.<br> Of course it was an accident.<br> When a man is as short as you, it must be very<br> difficult to gauge the height of the birds.<br> - Mr. Meredith.<br> - Hmm?<br> You haven't seen Commander Meredith<br> anywhere, have you'?<br> - No. - He never came downstairs<br> and he's not in his room.<br> Mr. Jennings,<br> I've washed him and dressed him.<br> If he can't find his way to<br> the drawing room, it isn't my fault.<br> If you've finished with that,<br> go and see Mrs. Croft.<br> Oh, I-I'm so sorry, sir.<br> I didn't mean to disturb you.<br> No, no, no, please.<br> I'm just trying some of your jam.<br> I must be in your way.<br> No, no. No, no.<br> No bother.<br> What one is that, sir?<br> Um, it's raspberry.<br> October 31.<br> You might like to try the, um...<br> strawberry one.<br> Oh, is that strawberry?<br> Let's see.<br> Ah, yes.<br> Mmm.<br> You all right, sir?<br> Just been with<br> the inspector and...<br> I feel a little bruised.<br> Mmm.<br> Why is it, would you say, that some people<br> seem to get whatever they want in life?<br> Everything they touch turns to gold.<br> Whereas others<br> can strive and strive...<br> and have nothing.<br> I wonder, do you believe in luck?<br> Do you think some men<br> are lucky and...<br> some men just aren't and...<br> nothing they can do about it?<br> I believe in love.<br> Not just getting it Giving it.<br> I think as long as you can love<br> somebody, whether or not they love you,<br> then it's worth it, and...<br> That's a good answer.<br> Uh, I think I've got to go.<br> Must have finished dinner by now.<br> Thank you.<br> I thought the wine<br> was frightful tonight. Vile.<br> Jennings, old boy,<br> I'll have a bourbon.<br> We don't have bourbon.<br> We have ordinary Scotch or single malt.<br> Ordinary for me.<br> I'm just an American.<br> Who cares? We know you here.<br> Look, I understand that this is not an ideal<br> time, but I would like to see you again.<br> Mabel is so clever to travel light.<br> Why should one wear<br> a different frock every evening?<br> We're not in a fashion parade.<br> No, and I wouldn't want to be<br> Excuse me.<br> Difficult color, green.<br> - What did she say?<br> - Mmm. Very tricky.<br> - Isobel.<br> - Excuse me.<br> It sort of draws you.<br> I'll have another look at it.<br> Oh, how this tune<br> used to make me cry.<br> Certainly, sir.<br> Very good.<br> - I promise you I can pay back every penny.<br> - Just take it.<br> - Your bid.<br> - I must say,<br> your guests sleep in much more<br> comfortable beds than your servants.<br> Excuse me.<br> - What did Isobel give to you? What did Isobel give to you?<br> - Don't make a scene here.<br> - Ivor dear.<br> - No more lies, Freddie.<br> Would it be possible to play<br> something more cheerful?<br> We're all quite emotional enough<br> as it is.<br> - Give it to me.<br> - What?<br> Excuse me.<br> Freddie, stop all your lies.<br> If you don't give it to me,<br> I will scream this house down.<br> - You don't believe me, try me.<br> - Anthony, there you are.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - I...<br> - You know, you've missed dinner. We can organize a tray for you.<br> - I don't want anything.<br> Try buying yourself<br> a new frock with that.<br> - We gave up, Louisa dear.<br> - Oh. Right.<br> I'm so, so sorry.<br> Mmm, no coffee, George,<br> but I'll have a...<br> - Aah! - I do apologise, sir.<br> Can't imagine how that happened.<br> You son of a bitch.<br> You did that on purpose!<br> Shall I fetch you a towel, sir?<br> Oh!<br> - Arthur.<br> - Oh, dear!<br> Clean this up, will you.<br> They were fishin' parts of her body out<br> the Thames from Richmond to Rotherhithe.<br> Some more tea, Constable?<br> I'll I take that.<br> Thank you, Bertha.<br> No head.<br> No hands.<br> - Unfortunately, the body had no distinguishing marks.<br> - What's the point in that?<br> - Won't it all be chucked out?<br> - I'll know I've left everything in good order.<br> That's all I can do for him now.<br> - Yeah, but he won't...<br> - Hey, leave him alone.<br> George has had his revenge on<br> Mr. Denton... hot coffee in the lap.<br> - Oh!<br> - Poor Mr. Denton.<br> Constable, I'm glad I caught you.<br> I assume the inspector won't keep everyone<br> beyond tomorrow, but I thought I'd better check.<br> - Well, we haven't spoke to all the servants yet, so...<br> - Ah, there you are, Dexter.<br> - Come on, we're going home.<br> - I was just asking how long our guests will be staying.<br> Mrs. Croft has meals to arrange, and I know<br> one of the housemaids is anxious to get away.<br> I don't think there's any need to worry about that.<br> I'm not interested in the servants.<br> Only people with a real connection<br> with the dead man.<br> I see.<br> Thank you.<br> - Do you have a light, Inspector?<br> - Yes.<br> Yes, I think we can let them<br> all go home, to be honest.<br> I've got their addresses, after all.<br> Constable Dexter will be here<br> tomorrow morning to confirm that.<br> Don't you worry.<br> It doesn't end here. Oh, no.<br> Whoever he is, I'll find him.<br> I always do.<br> Inspector. Your matches.<br> Yes. Thank you.<br> Uh, sir, I think<br> you'll find it's this way.<br> Well, yes, we could use this one.<br> There is, I think, a way out that way,<br> but, yeah, we'll take your way.<br> Ohh!<br> Beg your pardon, sir.<br> Just collecting<br> Mr. Nesbitt's shoes, sir.<br> I think you'll find these stairs<br> are the easiest way up, sir.<br> - Thank you, uh...<br> - George, sir.<br> George.<br> You naughty, naughty girl.<br> Poor bloke.<br> We were in the ironing room the other night<br> and one of the visiting maids walked in.<br> Must think I did it on purpose.<br> - You won't tell, will ya?<br> - I won't tell.<br> But you're lucky you're in the kitchen<br> and not under Mrs. Wilson.<br> She'd have sniffed you out<br> without any help from me.<br> Do you think<br> Sir William was in love with you?<br> Nah. I was a bit of fun, that's all.<br> And you?<br> I didn't love him.<br> I didn't mind him, but...<br> I liked the way he'd talk.<br> He'd only talk to me because<br> he was sick of her, but I liked it.<br> He used to say to me I could be anything<br> I wanted as long as I wanted it enough.<br> You're not sorry, then? Even after<br> the way things have turned out?<br> Nah, I'm not sorry.<br> It's time for a change.<br> Who knows'?<br> Could be the makin' of me.<br> What did he used to say?<br> Carpe diem. Seize the day.<br> What's up?<br> What did I say?<br> Where are you going?<br> Who is it?<br> What are you doing?<br> You'd better go back to your room.<br> You don't want to<br> get caught in here.<br> You didn't really dislike him, did you?<br> Not really.<br> At least not enough to kill him.<br> You can't have.<br> You didn't know him.<br> You'd have to hate him.<br> And why would you?<br> Can't a man hate his own father?<br> Sir William McCordle...<br> was my father.<br> He didn't know it,<br> but he was.<br> You said you were an orphan.<br> No, I didn't.<br> I said I grew up in an orphanage.<br> Not long before I left, a group of us<br> broke in to the warden's office one night<br> and took out our files.<br> I found my birth certificate.<br> Mother's name, father unknown.<br> Found this photograph.<br> And they had my admission form.<br> I was two days old.<br> Guess who brought me to the door.<br> - Robert, that doesn't mean that he...<br> - Yes, it does.<br> After that, I found out<br> she worked in one of his factories.<br> She wasn't the only one, apparently.<br> Either the authorities didn't know,<br> or they didn't want to know.<br> They took his babies...<br> and they took his money.<br> What happened to your mother?<br> She died.<br> Is that why you took the job<br> with Lord Stockbridge?<br> To get to Sir William?<br> To poison him?<br> I didn't poison him.<br> What?<br> I didn't poison him.<br> But then you didn't kill him.<br> Did you stab him?<br> Even if you did,<br> he was already dead.<br> And whoever did it must have known that.<br> No one could stab a corpse and not know it.<br> Really? When was the last time<br> you stabbed a corpse?<br> You really murdered him, then.<br> I don't know.<br> I don't care.<br> Ooh.<br> I've been wanting to do that<br> ever since I first set eyes on you.<br> Mr. Jennings?<br> Wilson!<br> Mrs. Wilson. Mrs...<br> Dorothy. I need your help.<br> Of course, Mrs. Wilson.<br> Are you all right?<br> - No one must see him like this.<br> - Ohh.<br> Help me.<br> - Mr. Jennings?<br> - Come on, Mr. Jennings.<br> Come on. Bedtime.<br> - All right, bedtime.<br> - No, this way. Come on, Mr. Jennings.<br> Bedtime, Mr. Jennings.<br> Bedtime now. Come on.<br> Where is r-r...<br> Where is my reference?<br> You'll get your reference. Into bed now.<br> Into bed.<br> - Aah!<br> - Watch him. Watch him.<br> Take his trousers off, Dorothy.<br> I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilson.<br> I couldn't do that.<br> Take his trousers off.<br> Come on.<br> - Come on.<br> - Dorothy.<br> Who is it?<br> - Oh, I'm ever so sorry, sir.<br> - Sorry for what?<br> I'm supposed to get the fire lit<br> without waking you.<br> Why does everyone treat me as if<br> I were one of these stupid snobs?<br> I spent half the week<br> downstairs with all of you.<br> You can't be on both teams<br> at once, sir.<br> It's official.<br> They're off after breakfast.<br> Thank God for that.<br> What about him?<br> He's going too,<br> as soon as he's seen Mr. Jennings.<br> Are you all right, Mrs. Croft?<br> You sound a bit funny.<br> Oh, just too many fags, that's all.<br> They'll be the death of me.<br> Here, you finish it.<br> - Did you tell the police any of that<br> stuff in the end'? - I did not.<br> I'm sorry if I shock you, but the plain<br> fact is, he only got what he deserved.<br> There.<br> I've said it.<br> I can't stop thinkin'<br> about those girls.<br> - The ones that got, you know...<br> - Well, I'm not surprised, the way you carry on.<br> Just see it never happens<br> to you, that's all.<br> It won't.<br> And even if it did, I know I couldn't part<br> with my baby, not just to hang on to a job.<br> Well, I'm very glad to hear it.<br> Who is it?<br> No, don't mind me, Mr. Jennings.<br> Inspector Thompson's just asked me<br> to take one last look around.<br> - Is the inspector with you?<br> - No, we're working from the station from now on.<br> See if we can't manage things<br> better from there.<br> What about the poison?<br> Have you traced that at least?<br> Hardly.<br> This house is a poisoner's paradise.<br> We found the stuff...<br> in practically ev...<br> every room.<br> Unfortunately, no one's<br> got a police record.<br> Well, except you, of course.<br> Perhaps the butler did it.<br> I had a brother who was<br> a conscientious objector.<br> He did a bit of time too.<br> Did they know upstairs you refused<br> to fight and were sent to prison?<br> I'd forget about it if I were you.<br> Not everyone's cutout<br> to be a soldier.<br> - Did you remember the other boxes?<br> - Everything's in the car, milady.<br> Wonderful.<br> Good.<br> Darling, here I come.<br> - Do you know, I can't wait to leave this place.<br> - Let's go.<br> Christ, what are we<br> supposed to do now?<br> Freddie, do try to stop<br> being so frightened all the time.<br> - Darling, have I made the most terrible fool of myself?<br> - Maybe.<br> - Bye.<br> - Anthony.<br> - Um, Anthony...<br> - Oh, God.<br> I wanted to remind you of the conversation<br> we had at dinner the other night.<br> Um, perhaps this is not<br> the most appropriate moment,<br> but when you get to the Sudan you're going<br> to need an expert, and I'm your man.<br> - Well, I want to know...<br> - Did you ask her?<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - I think, on reflection, that's a good thing.<br> According to<br> the servants' hall gossip,<br> she won't get any of her estate<br> till her mother dies.<br> - Honestly, Jeremy...<br> - If that's the case, it's too long to wait.<br> You can do better.<br> H-Have you checked your room?<br> You mustn't leave anything behind.<br> I'm sure Mummy's<br> going to sell the house.<br> Isabel<br> lsabel. lsabel!<br> Sidney Kent's<br> taking over the studio.<br> He loves Charlie Chan<br> and he hates Winfield Sheehan.<br> - Sir. - No more rewrites,<br> and I can cast whoever I like<br> Well, that was painless, wasn't it?<br> No, it wasn't.<br> - Hmm.<br> - Not for me, anyway<br> Careful, careful.<br> Watch yourself.<br> Whoa!<br> Do they know?<br> - No.<br> - Don't you think they might notice?<br> I don't care.<br> Hey, you there.<br> Where you going?<br> To the station.<br> Hey, you want a ride to London?<br> Sure. Why not?<br> - Hop in.<br> - Thank you.<br> There you go.<br> Well, good luck.<br> Don't do anything I wouldn't do.<br> At least I know that gives me<br> room for manoeuvre.<br> No, keep your hands to yourself.<br> You Brits really don't have<br> a sense of humor, do you?<br> We do if something's funny, sir.<br> - Mr. Jennings, can...<br> - Be quick about it.<br> Honestly,<br> it's getting so expensive,<br> by the time one does Jennings<br> and leave something for the housemaids,<br> one might as well<br> have taken a suite at the Ritz.<br> Tell me, what happened<br> to William's little maid?<br> I never saw her again<br> after that dinner.<br> - Elsie?<br> - Mmm.<br> - She's gone.<br> - Ohh. That's a pity, really.<br> Thought it was a good idea to have someone<br> in the house who's actually sorry he's dead.<br> Oh, there you are, dear.<br> Did you have a nice ride?<br> I'm feeling rather guilty. Apparently<br> everyone's gone, apart from you and Louisa.<br> - Why don't you stay for lunch?<br> - No, I must be off.<br> Leave you in peace.<br> Now, you will...<br> you will telephone...<br> about the funeral plans, mmm?<br> - You don't have to come if it's a bore.<br> - Nonsense. Of course I'm coming.<br> Have you decided what you're going<br> to do about this place?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Will you keep it?<br> It's so difficult.<br> - I mean, does one really want<br> the bother nowadays? - Mmm.<br> I suppose I could shut it up...<br> and make a decision<br> when my head stops spinning.<br> Mrs. Wilson could manage<br> till you're ready.<br> Oh, yes, she could manage, all right.<br> Let's not worry about that.<br> No doubt she'll seize the opportunity<br> to get rid of the wretched Mrs. Croft.<br> - Why are those two such enemies?<br> - I don't know.<br> Something to do with when they were both<br> workers in one of William's sweatshops.<br> Mrs. Croft was the senior then.<br> She was the cook.<br> And Mrs. Wilson<br> a lowly factory worker.<br> Now that she's got up in the world,<br> poor old Croftie can't abide it.<br> The usual rubbish.<br> - Was there ever a Mr. Wilson?<br> I can't imagine it. - Nor could I.<br> Although, funnily enough,<br> I think there must have been.<br> Really?<br> You amaze me.<br> She might have changed her name,<br> but when she was working with William she<br> was called something quite different...<br> Parks or Parker or Parkinson<br> or something like that.<br> Come in.<br> - You're busy. - No, no, I was just<br> checking the linen rotation.<br> If I'd have left it to the maids,<br> the same 20 sheets would be used<br> till they fell into rags.<br> Why did you do it?<br> How did you know it was him?<br> Was it the name, or did you<br> see the photograph in his room?<br> Ah, yes, the photograph.<br> It's a miracle that survived.<br> I remember his mother<br> putting it into his blanket.<br> I suppose she wanted him<br> to have something of hers.<br> Does he know what happened to her?<br> They said she died<br> just after he was born.<br> Well, she didn't die.<br> She gave him away.<br> He promised the boy would be adopted.<br> He said he knew the family.<br> Turns out we all<br> clung to that dream,<br> all us girls.<br> A better start in life<br> for our children.<br> And all the time he was dumping them,<br> his own children,<br> in some godforsaken place.<br> And I believed him.<br> I suppose it was easier that way.<br> My sister certainly<br> never forgave me for it.<br> Your sister?<br> Yes, Mrs. Croft.<br> She's my sister. Didn't you know?<br> She kept hers, you see.<br> It was very hard for her. She lost<br> her job, and then the baby died anyway<br> Scarlet fever.<br> I made him take her back.<br> She never forgave me for that either.<br> But even if Robert is your son,<br> how did you know that<br> he meant to harm his father?<br> What gift do you think a good servant<br> has that separates them from the others?<br> It's the gift of anticipation.<br> And I'm a good servant.<br> I'm better than good. I'm the best.<br> I'm the perfect servant.<br> I know when they'll be hungry<br> and the food is ready.<br> I know when they'll be tired<br> and the bed is turned down.<br> I know it before<br> they know it themselves.<br> Are you going to tell him?<br> Why? What purpose<br> would it possibly serve?<br> What if they find out<br> what happened?<br> Not much of a crime<br> to stab a dead man, is it?<br> They can never touch him.<br> That's what's important... his life.<br> And your life?<br> Didn't you hear me?<br> I'm the perfect servant. I have no life.<br> Her Ladyship's leaving now, miss.<br> Thank you, George.<br> Well, you should go now,<br> Miss Trentham.<br> - Here you are, Jennings.<br> - Well, good-bye, Sylvia.<br> - Good-bye. For you.<br> - Thank you.<br> Do let us know if there's anything...<br> anything we can do to help.<br> Are you going away?<br> No, not once<br> the shooting's finished.<br> Thank you for your help last night.<br> You don't have to thank me.<br> You know I'd kill<br> for Mr. Jennings if I had to.<br> Don't cry, Jane.<br> They'll hear you.<br> Come on.<br> You did what you felt<br> was best for him at the time.<br> I see that now.<br> Lizzie.<br> I've lost him.<br> I've lost him.<br> He'll never know me now.<br> My boy.<br> Oh, my boy...<br> Well, at least your boy is alive.<br> He's alive.<br> That's what matters.<br> So, you're leaving.<br> Yes.<br> Good-bye then.<br> - Good-bye.<br> - Parks.<br> - Good-bye, my dear.<br> - Get in, Bennett.<br> Chin up, chin up.<br> - What a relief to be going.<br> - What time is it, Jennings?<br> It'll take me a month to recover.<br> - Oh, Mary.<br> - 12:35, milady.<br> Do you think if there's a trial<br> I might have to testify in court?<br> Or you?<br> I can't think of anything worse.<br> Imagine a person being hanged<br> because of something one said in court.<br> I know.<br> And what purpose<br> could it possibly serve anyway'?<br> Good-bye.<br>
