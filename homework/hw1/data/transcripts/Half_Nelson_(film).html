opposites.<br> It's two things that<br> push against each other<br> in opposite directions.<br> So the civil rights movement,<br> okay, it's essentially,<br> It's two opposing mentalities.<br> In the south,<br> the majority believes<br> All men are not created equal,<br> and there's a minority<br> Who believes that they are,<br> so that minority struggles<br> and it fights and it pushes<br> till eventually<br> It becomes the majority.<br> Am I boring you?<br> Huh?<br> Let's give you some examples,<br> okay, of opposing forces,<br> Like I'm going to go<br> night and day.<br> What else?<br> Big

cook up<br> these burgers then, huh?<br> Hey, Mom, you know this dude<br> Cesar Chavez<br> on Spanish Six?<br> Cesar who?<br> Cesar Chavez.<br> He once fasted for 35 days.<br> That means he didn't eat<br> For 35 days,<br> Something like Gandhi<br> Used to do.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Think you could do that?<br> Hi, honey, it's Mom.<br> Hello?<br> Hi, um, is Rachel there?<br> Well, I feel good today.<br> Anyone else feel good?<br> Hmm?<br> I need a volunteer, and I need<br> somebody who feels strong.<br> So what we've got here<br> Is two opposing forces,<br> Terrence and myself, and we're<br> pushing against each other.<br> and as long as one is stronger--<br> and it looks like it's t--<br> The change is slow<br> and consistent.<br> But once the other side<br> becomes stronger,<br> There's a turning point.<br> Thank you, T.<br> Make sense?<br> Okay.<br> Now, turning points<br> can happen like that.<br> They can be physical, or they<br> can happen on a greater scale,<br> Like a war or something.<br> So why don't you do me<br> a favor and write<br> Three examples<br> Of historical turning points<br> That we've talked about<br> in class, okay?<br> What's up?<br> Have you even opened the<br> Civil Rights binder I gave you?<br> The Civil Rights binder<br> I have opened,<br> and it's got some great stuff<br> in it.<br> I think it's great.<br> Yeah.<br>

Oh, what's his name?<br> Mr. Easton and Mrs. Wright<br> In the movie theater.<br> I'm pretty sure<br> they're married.<br> No.<br> I don't, they can't.<br> You don't know what you're<br> talking about, so don't talk.<br> No, but they look<br> weird together.<br> Y'all think Mr. Dunn is married?<br> No way.<br> Nobody would marry him.<br> Would you want to marry him?<br> Come in the room,<br> swirling his finger around,<br> Telling us to move the desk.<br> Why can't he move the desk?<br> I'm getting tired of that<br> every morning.<br> Don't forget about his glasses.<br> and he--<br> --bifocals.<br> --he start<br> Throwing them around,<br> throwing the chalk<br> Like he all cool and fly<br> and everything, but--<br> Ridley?<br> Quiet.<br> Would you marry Mr. Dunn,<br> Ridley?<br> Would you marry your father?<br> Oh.<br> "a man who was curious to know<br> If a knife could penetrate<br> "his bulletproof vest<br> Was killed yesterday<br> "by a stab wound to the chest.<br> "witnesses say the man,<br> Jeff Turner, 32,<br> "urged his brother,<br> Scott Turner, 35, to stab him<br> "as hard as he could, believing<br> The vest would stop the knife.<br> It didn't."<br> So how's<br> Your opposite somethings?<br> Pretty good.<br> Where'd you come up<br> with that stuff?<br> It's just a little something<br> I picked up in college.<br> A little thick<br> for the eighth grade, no?<br> Yeah, yeah, well, you'd think,<br> but I don't know.<br> I think they're getting it.<br> I don't know how you get away<br> With it though.<br> You know,<br> Drey is so textbook.<br> How's your book?<br> Don't ask.<br> There's always the summer.<br> Do you want to go?<br> You want to have dinner<br> with me again?<br> Okay.<br> Mm-hmm?<br> Did you guys hear<br> that they found<br> A crack vial in the locker room?<br> Jesus.<br> Hmm.<br> Do they know<br> whose it is?<br> Whose it is?<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Hey, you know what?<br> That's a good idea.<br> We can put it in the lost<br> and found to see<br> if anybody claims it.<br> Better yet, why don't we put up<br> flyers with a picture?<br> What's new?<br> I don't know.<br> I can't hear you.<br> Come over here.<br> That's a nice cap.<br> Thanks.<br> It's Mike's.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Talk to him lately?<br> He writes sometimes.<br> How's he doing in there?<br> All right, I guess.<br> Well, if he needs

lose.<br> Come on.<br> What's up with that juice?<br> I'm not thirsty.<br> Well, don't be a stranger, kid.<br> You could stop through<br> and say hello.<br> Yeah.<br> You saw Frank today?<br> Just ran into him.<br> On September 13, 1971,<br> Seized control of the prison<br> and took hostages<br> To negotiate changes<br> to their inhumane conditions.<br> Governor Nelson Rockefeller<br> ordered a military assault<br> On the prison which killed<br> Every one caused<br> from police gunshots.<br> An official commission later<br> Stated, with the exception<br> Of Indian massacres<br> In the late 19th century,<br> The police assault was<br> the bloodiest one-day encounter<br> Between Americans<br> Since the civil war.<br> Unbelievable.<br> What are you doing?<br> Go sit in the desk.<br> Ten points off.<br> Second chances are rare, man.<br> You ought to take<br> better advantage of them.<br> Don't let go.<br> Grab the t-shirt if you need to.<br> You know, a little elbow here<br> and there never killed anybody,<br> You know what I mean?<br> As long as the ref<br> isn't looking.<br> Not in my house.<br> It's a nice surprise.<br> Where's Mom?<br> Working.<br> Darrel's uncle came to visit<br> so I came along with him.<br> How's Darrel's leg?<br> It's all right.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> Those for me?<br> Frank's for sending me<br> some of them nasty peppermints<br> He always eating.<br> What is that?<br> I threw them shits out.<br> So how's the team?<br> We suck.<br> and Ma,<br> still working too hard?<br> Yeah.<br> But she all right<br> for money though.<br> Frank still looking out?<br> Yeah.<br> Good.<br> He owes us.<br> So how come<br> you never told on him?<br> For what?<br> Would've made shit<br> more complicated.<br> and shit was already fucked up<br> as it is, you know?<br> That's all in the past, though.<br> I'm going to get out of here.<br> You'll see.<br> I mean, you got Russell Simmons<br> On the case.<br> Russell Simmons?<br> Look, we'll be all right.<br> I have to write<br> an essay about growing up.<br> If I don't turn it in<br> by tomorrow<br> I'm going to fail the course.<br> Well, that's your problem,<br> Charles.<br> My problem is making sure<br> that you keep an eye on things<br> While I'm gone.<br> Actually that's also<br> your problem.<br> You've got a lot<br> Of problems, Charles.<br> Don't let them get<br> in the way of your work.<br> There's a time when<br> the operation of the machine<br> Becomes so odious,<br> makes you so sick at heart<br> That you can't take part.<br> You can't even passively<br> take part, and you've got<br> To put your bodies upon<br> the gears and upon the wheels,<br> Upon the levers,<br> upon all the apparatus<br> and you've got to make it stop,<br> and you've got to indicate<br> to the people who run it,<br> to the people who own it<br> that unless you're free,<br> the machine will be prevented<br> from working at all.<br> What is this machine<br> that he's talking about?<br> It's keeping us down.<br> What is it?<br> Like robots and stuff, right?<br> It could be robots.<br> It could be robots,<br> but let's say it's a metaphor.<br> He's saying this machine<br> is keeping me down.<br> Now, what is that?<br> What keeps us from being free?<br> Ms. Drey?<br> Prisons.<br> Absolutely, absolutely.<br> Prisons, okay?<br> Prisons are definitely<br> a part of it.<br> What else?<br> White.<br> White is definitely<br> a part of it.<br> The man.<br> The school.<br> The school, exactly.<br> The whole education system<br> is part of the machine.<br> What else?<br> Aren't you the machine then?<br> Oh, no, you didn't.<br> What'd you say?<br> Aren't you the machine?<br> You're saying I'm the machine?<br> Yeah, you're white.<br> You're part of the school.<br> Oh, yeah,<br> I guess you got a point.<br> All right,<br> so I'm part of the machine,<br> But if I'm part of it<br> so are you.<br> You are, too.<br> we all are.<br> And this is the thing,<br> remember?<br> Everything is made<br> with opposing force.<br> We may be opposed<br> to the machine,<br> But we're still very much<br> a part of it, right?<br> I work for the government,<br> the school, but I'm also<br> Very much opposed<br> to a lot of its policies.<br> You guys hate coming to school,<br> right?<br> Yes.<br> Holler back if you heard me.<br> You hate it,<br> but you come anyway.<br> Sometimes.<br> Sometimes, exactly.<br> Yo, what's up?<br> Where you headed?<br> You look like<br> you're in a rush.<br> Hungry?<br> No, I'm cool.<br> I'm starving.<br> Come on.<br> Burger's on me.<br> So how's school?<br> It's hard.<br> What's up with basketball?<br> I got a game tomorrow.<br> Word.<br> Want to come?<br> Your Mom's going to be there?<br> Working.<br> Pops?<br>

You still rocking out?<br> When the occasion calls.<br> Yeah.<br> Who's the lucky guy?<br> I met him in the program.<br> I don't know, Dan.<br> Some people change.<br> Some people actually change.<br> Yeah, but not me.<br> I know.<br> No way.<br> I'm still an asshole.<br> You're not an asshole.<br> You're just a big baby.<br> I'm a big asshole baby.<br> Let's go, rebels.<br> Pass it in.<br> All

language.<br> All right.<br> Good luck, girls.<br> I think your hand is changing<br> colors get more ice on it.<br> You should've seen the wall.<br> I'm telling you, Dunn,<br> you should've knocked<br> that nigga out.<br> You can't go around<br> knocking people out, you know,<br> Or throwing balls at them<br> just because you're upset.<br> It would've felt good,<br> though, right,<br> Felt good to just get it out.<br> There's other ways<br> of getting it out.<br> Right.<br> Like you do?<br> Look, just because you know<br> that one thing about me,<br> One thing doesn't make a man.<br> What?<br> One thing doesn't make a man?<br> You know I was just talking<br> about your hand right?<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I knew that.<br> Hey, who was that guy<br> that was cheering for you?<br> Do you know him?<br> Not really.<br> Do you?<br> No.<br> So we can just keep the whole<br> punching the wall thing<br> A secret, right?<br> You don't have to tell anybody,<br> right?<br> What's up, Santa Claus?<br> Where you going?<br> Shit.<br> I had a good day.<br> Even after the dolphin report,<br> right?<br> Even after it says<br> there are no weapons.<br> There are no WMD programs.<br> There is nothing.<br> They do that,<br> The Pippa study,<br> That University<br> Of Maryland thing,<br> and turns out 72 percent<br> Of his supporters<br> Still believe there's WMDs.<br> Seventy-five percent<br> still believe they're supporting<br> Al Qaeda and so what<br> the fuck do we do you know?<br> What do you do?<br> What does one, I'm one man,<br> what I do, you know?<br> I used to be so fucked up.<br> I used to be so fucked up<br> I was just out there, you know,<br> But I fucking cleaned up.<br> I cleaned up--<br> For the most part.<br> I do it now to get by,<br> but I can handle it.<br> You know what I mean?<br> I tried the rehab thing.<br> I tried it.<br> It didn't work.<br> It didn't work.<br> You know,<br> it works for some people.<br> My ex-girlfriend<br> is getting married.<br> So it works for some people,<br> right?<br> It didn't work for me.<br> The kids keep me focused,<br> and I--<br> Number three:<br> Change moves in spirals,<br> not circles.<br> For example, the sun goes up<br> and then it comes down,<br> But every time that happens<br> what do you get?<br> You get a new day.<br> You get a new one.<br> When you breathe, you inhale<br> and then you exhale,<br> But every single time<br> that you do that<br> You're a little bit different<br> than the one before.<br> We're always changing,<br> and it's important to know<br> That there are some changes<br> you can't control<br> But that there are others<br> you can.<br> Any students who did not turn<br> in their Hall of Science<br> Field trip permission slips<br> must do so by the

somebody<br> On the way here, you know.<br> and he's like, what?<br> He's like, oh, yeah<br> I kill him, I kill him.<br> and he's like, what do you,<br> You, you killed him?<br> He's, like, yeah,<br> I kill people all the time.<br> I'm killing people,<br> you know, anybody<br> Who really kind of mouth off<br> to me, I fucking kill them, man.<br> Turns out he thinks "kill" is<br> the word for "punch," right?<br> Uh huh.<br> So he's punching people.<br> My friend thinks<br> that he's killing them.<br> He's terrified and he thinks<br> that the word for "cement"<br> is "semen."<br> So he's like well, basically<br> You can't go anywhere in India<br> without, you know,<br> stepping on semen.<br> There's semen everywhere.<br> There's semen buildings.<br> It's lot of people, you know,<br> so everything is made of semen,<br> you know.<br> I didn't say every day.<br> You're her father.<br> Today she got locked out<br> the house.<br> She didn't even<br> have your number at work.<br> Are you a communist?<br> What?<br> I was looking<br> through your books.<br> "Che in Africa"?<br> So?<br> "The Communist Manifesto?"<br> If I had a copy of "Mein Kampf"<br> Would that make me a Nazi?<br> You know, this is really good,<br> very tasty.<br> You should try it warm.<br> Well, you don't have<br> a copy of of "Mein Kampf"<br> But if you did, then yes,<br> I'd ask you if you were a Nazi.<br> Maybe I'm hiding it.<br> Why would you hide it?<br> 'Cause it's just not cool<br> To be a Nazi anymore, baby.<br> So what are you doing today?<br> Oh, I got to--<br> It's great you're writing.<br> Yeah, we'll see.<br> I should let you get to it then.<br> Yeah, thanks though.<br> I had a good time.<br> Yeah, me too.<br> On November 1, 1977,<br> Harvey Milk was elected<br> To the San Francisco<br> City Council.<br> He was the first<br> Openly gay person<br> To ever be elected<br> To public office.<br> A year later he was<br> assassinated by another member<br> Of the City Council<br> Called Dan White.<br> --reports that Harvey Milk<br> have been shot and killed.<br> Dan White claimed he shot Milk<br> because he ate<br> too much junk food that day.<br> This would later be known<br> As the twinkie defense.<br> Is that for real?<br> Drey, Drey, come here.<br> Where are you going?<br> Home.<br> I'll give you a ride home.<br> That's cool.<br> I got a ride.<br> I don't really think<br> you should be riding with him,<br> do you think?<br> Drey, is everything cool?<br> Everything's okay.<br> I'm going to take her home.<br> Is that right?<br> Yeah.<br> Is that right, D, huh,<br> you getting a ride with teach?<br> No, man.<br> Drey, Drey, Drey, come here.<br> Everything's fine.<br> Have a nice night.<br> I'm going to take her home,<br> Okay?<br> Hey, look, man, you know what,<br> let me introduce myself, huh?<br> I'm Frank.<br> Come here now, okay?<br> Come here.<br> Come here.<br> Hey, hey, hey.<br> Coach?<br> You need to take it easy, man.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Come on.<br> Did I hurt you?<br> Didn't mean to.<br> We'll see you later, Teach.<br> Come on.<br> Dunn, right?<br> Lloyd Dixon.<br> My daughter Paula went<br> To Jefferson, Paula Dixon.<br> You taught history, right?<br> Paula Dixon?<br> She's in her first semester<br> At Georgetown, history major.<br> Paula Dixon.<br> You have a good night.<br> Dave?<br> Dave?<br> In Asia the idea that things<br> are made of opposites,<br> Ying and Yang,<br> dates back 3,000 years.<br> That was them saying change<br> is the only constant,<br> But that just died in the west.<br> It just couldn't be both,<br> couldn't be black and white.<br> It would be right and wrong.<br> It had to be one or the other.<br> Who am I to say<br> that Aristotle is wrong, right,<br> but that doesn't make any sense.<br> These things need each other.<br> The idea that all<br> God's creations are "perfect"--<br> So just to suggest that a tree,<br> it's crooked and it's straight,<br> It's strong<br> and it's weak, is to suggest<br> That god created<br> something imperfect.<br> They do however<br> acknowledge it in people.<br> We are sinners, but we can<br> strive to be good,<br> Just not in nature itself,<br> I guess.<br> Oh, I've got to go.<br> You guys write down<br> what's on the board.<br> "Broward County Florida<br> Middle schools mistakenly<br> "failed over 6500 students<br> In June due to what<br> "later called a computer error.<br> "a school official called the<br> total count of students affected<br> An insignificant sum."<br> What goes, Danny boy?<br> How's history?<br> I can't do it

this bike.<br> Sorry.<br> I just didn't know<br> it was your bike.<br> You hella sorry, nigger.<br> I should fuck you up.<br> Get off my bike.<br> So what happened, huh?<br> What?<br> I thought you<br> Was going fuck him up?<br> Didn't have to.<br> Oh, shit, okay,<br> you didn't have to.<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> It's back.<br> Yeah.<br> Did you know my brother?<br> I knew of him, but I

think Henderson<br> was looking for you.<br> Must be about<br> the new curriculum, huh?<br> Yeah, no, I'm sure that's it,<br> but, hey, Dan,<br> If there's anything else<br> going on, you know,<br> If you need any help,<br> you know, anything,<br> You know<br> we're here for you, pal.<br> Close the door.<br> Is there something going on<br> that I should know about?<br> On September 11, 1973,<br> The CIA helped overthrow<br> and murder democratically-<br> Elected Chilean president<br> Salvador Allende.<br> The military coup led<br> To mass disappearances,<br> assassinations and tortures<br> Of thousands<br> Of Chilean civilians<br> under the leadership<br> Of U.S. backed dictator<br> Augusto Pinochet.<br> Secretary of State<br> Henry Kissinger<br> Said of Allende's 1970<br> Election, "these issues<br> are much<br> Too important for<br> the Chilean voters<br> to decide for themselves."<br> Danny?<br> Hi, Mom.<br> What happened to your lip?<br> That's plenty, thanks.<br> That's good.<br>
