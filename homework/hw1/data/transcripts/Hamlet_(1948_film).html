Let's keep the funeral dinner going!<br> Tonight Ophelia will be buried.<br> The Church has no prayers for a suicide!<br> Darling, poor sister!<br> For father and sister, I demand satisfaction! At the break of dawn I challenge you to a duel!<br> Woe! Claudius!<br> In this duel both you and I will take revenge! - I know a way to help you win it.<br> And if you do not strike him, he shall drink death from my hand!<br> I am not cowardly, but a vague foreboding oppresses my heart!<br> Drink, brave Hamlet!<br> The wrong goblet! Poison!<br> Only death betrays your secret! That you had the golden heart of a woman!
