                        (man) God, she's beautiful.|She's got the prettiest eyes.<br> She looks so sexy in that sweater.<br> I just want to be alone with her|and hold her and kiss her<br> and tell her how much l love her|and take care ofher.<br> Stop it, you idiot! She's your wife's sister.<br> l can't help it. l'm consumed by her.|lt's been months now.<br> l dream about her,|l think about her at the office.<br> Oh, Lee. What am l gonna do?<br> l hear myselfmooning over you,|and it's disgusting.<br> Before, when she squeezed|past me in the doorway<br> and l smelt that perfume|on the back ofher neck...<br> Jesus, l thought l was gonna swoon.<br> Easy. You're a dignified financial advisor.|lt doesn't look good for you to swoon.<br> Elliot?<br> - Elliot? Sweetheart?|- Mm?<br> Have you tried these? They're wonderful.|Holly and her friend made them.<br> Fantastic. Your sister|is an unbelievable cook.<br> l know, l know.|She has all the cooking talent.<br> - No, you've got tons as well.|- l've eaten five of these.<br> - Holly, why don't you open a restaurant?|- Mm, we practically are.<br> Well... not a restaurant, but...|April and l are gonna do some catering.<br> - What? You're kidding.|- No, we decided.<br> Perfect.<br> We like to cook for friends, so...|until an acting job comes through,<br> we could make money|doing private parties.<br> - Great idea. That's where your talent lies.|- l know.<br> Get outta here.|Could l speak to you privately?<br> l'm her husband. She tells me anything.<br> Hannah, l need more money.|Don't get upset.<br> - l never get upset over that.|- This is the last time.<br> - l'm keeping strict accounts.|- Please, don't insult me.<br> - Someday l'll pay it back.|- l know. How much do you need?<br> - $2,000.|- Uh-huh?<br> l know it's a lot, but April and l have|this catering idea. lt's gonna be great.<br> You admit we're great cooks.<br> ln order to get started, there are a few|things to buy and some old debts to pay.<br> Just tell me one thing.|Are we talking cocaine again?<br> l swear. We've already got some|requests to do dinner parties.<br> Obviously l'm not gonna be a caterer|for ever. We both still go on auditions.<br> Something could come up at any|moment, but the parties are at night.<br> l can still take my acting class.|l haven't done drugs in a year.<br> A whimpering, simpering child again<br> Bewitched, bothered and bewildered...<br> Mom and Dad are floating|down memory lane again.<br> - Have you tried Holly's shrimp puffs?|- They're fantastic.<br> l need an antihistamine for Mom's asthma|before she turns into Camille.<br> Mom's Camille every morning.<br> - At least she isn't drinking.|- Doesn't she look great in that dress?<br> She knows it|cos she's flirting with the men.<br> When she's 80 she may stop straightening|her garter belt when there's a guy around.<br> - Where's the antihistamine?|- Elliot's got them somewhere.<br> - Frederick didn't come with her.|- When does he ever?<br> He's such an angry...|He's such a depressive.<br> - l thought she was moving out.|- l don't know.<br> A pill he is<br> But still he is<br> All mine and l'll keep him until he is<br> Bewitched...<br> Watch out, you guys! Beep-beep!<br> Your kids are so adorable.|lt gets so lonely on the holidays.<br> Oh, gosh. Well, that's why|l invited Phil Gammage tonight.<br> - Hannah, he's such a loser.|- He's not a loser at all.<br> - He's the head of Daisy's school.|- He reminds me of lchabod Crane.<br> His Adam's apple jumps up and down|when he gets excited.<br> He's a lot better than your ex-husband.|He's got a good job.<br> - He's not a dope addict.|- Give me a break.<br> - Am l interrupting any sister talk?|- Mm-mm.<br> Good, because there are no|interesting single men at this party.<br> Well, listen. Maybe April would like Phil.|Phil Gammage? The tall guy?<br> Oh, yeah, l met Phil.|He looks like lchabod Crane?<br> l love that. That's my type. No, really!<br> No, we mustn't get discouraged.<br> Hannah will invite some men over|who don't look like lchabod Crane.<br> Maybe at Christmas, or if not Christmas,|New Year's, or maybe next New Year's.<br> Ouch!<br> - lt must be here someplace.|- (Lee) Oh, you know?<br> l love that book you lent me,|The Easter Parade.<br> You were right.|lt had very special meaning for me.<br> How's Frederick? He didn't come.<br> You know. One of his moods.|But it wasn't a bad week.<br> - He sold a picture.|- Oh, great.<br> Yeah, it was one of his better drawings,|a very beautiful nude study.<br> Actually, it was of me.<br> lt's a funny feeling to know you're being|hung naked in a stranger's living room.<br> But you can't tell it's me, although...|You're turning all red, Elliot.<br> Oh, really?<br> - So... what else? What are you up to?|- l don't know.<br> My unemployment cheques|are running out.<br> l may do a course at Columbia|with the last of my savings.<br> - Like...?|- l don't know, exactly.<br> Sociology, psychology, maybe...<br> l always thought|l might work with children.<br> lncidentally, l always have|clients furnishing places.<br> Someone might be interested|in buying art. Shall l call you?<br> Yeah, sure. Frederick would|really be grateful for a sale.<br> (Hannah) Hey, guys! Dinner's ready!<br> You look so beautiful. Doesn't she?<br> l bumped into your ex-husband on|the street the other day. He's still crazy.<br> - He was on his way to get a blood test.|- Mickey's such a hypochondriac.<br> l wonder how he'd handle if there was|ever anything really wrong with him.<br> - (glass being tapped)|- Now, ladies and gentlemen...<br> - Dad...|- (glass rings)<br> - Dad...|- No, now this is a toast...<br> This is a toast. This is a toast.<br> You know, this beautiful Thanksgiving|dinner was all prepared by Hannah.<br> l had a little help from Mavis.|Also, Holly and April...<br> No, no. You did it. She did it.<br> And we drink to her,<br> and we congratulate her on her wonderful|accomplishment during this last year.<br> Her great success in A Doll's House.<br> (all cheer)<br> l played Nora.|l'd hate to tell you what year.<br> And it's very difficult to behave|like Torvald's little chipmunk<br> without making a perfect ass|out of yourself.<br> Now, l think that lbsen would have been|damned proud of our Hannah.<br> Speech! Speech!<br> No, no. l've been very, very lucky.<br> When l had the kids,|l decided to stop working<br> and just devote myself to having|the family and l've been very happy.<br> But l've always secretly hoped that|maybe some little gem would come along<br> and tempt me back on the stage.<br> Now l got that out of my system, l can go|back to the thing that makes me happy.<br> Bravo! Bravo!<br> ls it my imagination|or does Elliot have a little crush on me?<br> lt's funny. l've had that thought before.<br> He pays a lot ofattention|to me all the time.<br> And he blushed tonight|when we were alone in the bedroom.<br> l wonder ifhe and Hannah are happy.<br> lt's funny. l still feel|a little buzz from his flirting.<br> - You want some coffee or tea?|- (man) No, thank you.<br> - How about something to eat?|- No, nothing.<br> - Are you sure?|- Absolutely.<br> What am l gonna do with you? God!<br> Why didn't you come tonight? We all had|a terrific time. You would have enjoyed it.<br> l'm going through a period of my life|where l just can't be around people.<br> - l didn't want to abuse anyone.|- You wouldn't. They're all so sweet.<br> Lee, you are the only person|l can be with,<br> who l really look forward to being with.<br> You're too harsh with everyone.|You know that, don't you?<br> - lsn't it enough that l can love you?|- You're such a puzzle!<br> So sweet with me, and so|contemptuous of everyone else.<br> There was a time when you were|very happy to be only with me.<br> You wanted to learn everything|about poetry, about music.<br> Have l really taught you everything|l have to give? l don't think so.<br> Elliot said he might have|a couple of clients for you.<br> l'm sure those morons he handles|have a deep feeling for art.<br> You never know, they might.|He was just trying to do the nice thing.<br> - Because he likes you.|- Me?<br> Yeah. Elliot lusts after you.<br> Based on what? You never even see him.<br> When you see him, you come home|full of books he's recommended,<br> - or films you must see.|- Oh, no, no. He's my sister's husband.<br> And l think if you gave him half a chance,|you'd like him. He's very intelligent.<br> He's a glorified accountant|and he's after you.<br> And l prefer to sell my work to people|who appreciate it, not to rock stars.<br> You understand?<br> - Why can't we do the sketch?|- Standards and Practices say it's dirty.<br> They saw the rehearsal. They just|figured out what the words mean?<br> - Mickey, we got a half-hour to air.|- The show is five minutes short.<br> - How? We timed everything long.|- With no sketch, we're ten minutes short.<br> - How can they do that to us?|- lt's because our ratings are low.<br> - l have a migraine.|- Hey, Mickey! Listen.<br> You'd better go to Ronny's dressing room.|He took about 1600 Quaaludes.<br> - l don't think he can do the show.|- Why me, Lord?<br> You Standards and Practices?|Why is the sketch dirty?<br> Child molestation is a touchy subject...<br> - Half the country's doing it!|- Yes, but you name names.<br> - We don't. We say ''The Pope''.|- That sketch cannot go on the air.<br> Hey! Who changed|my sketch about the PLO?<br> l had to make cuts. lt's four lousy lines.<br> - The whole premise is ruined!|- lt's not so delicate.<br> - Everybody's married to every line.|- l don't care! Don't tamper with my work.<br> - OK...|- You want 'em cut? l'll cut 'em myself.<br> Mickey, listen. lnstead of the child|molestation sketch, why don't we repeat<br> the Cardinal Spellman-Ronald Reagan|homosexual dance number?<br> - l don't feel good, Mickey.|- What did you do? Swallow a drugstore?<br> - l lost my voice.|- Oh, Jesus!<br> Ronny, you know, you do|have to go on in 25 minutes.<br> Does anybody got a Tagamet?|My ulcer's startin' to kill me.<br> You want a Quaalude?<br> (Mickey)|Christ, this show is ruining my health.<br> Meanwhile, my ex-partner|moves to California<br> and every stupid show he produces|turns out to be a big hit.<br> Brother, what am l gonna do with my life?<br> Speaking ofthat, l gotta remember|to see my ex-wife tomorrow.<br> - Hi.|- l know.<br> - Glad you could put in an appearance.|- l got two minutes. The show is killin' me.<br> l got a million appointments today.|lt just fell this way.<br> - l gotta see new comedians...|- Just two minutes on your sons' birthday.<br> - lt's not gonna kill you.|- Happy birthday, fellas!<br> (Hannah) Daddy brought presents!<br> Hey, a little hug? What is this?|How about a little action from the kids?<br> - How is everything?|- Everything's fine.<br> OK, you can open the presents now.|l wanna get a little reaction.<br> - How's Elliot?|- He's fine.<br> l'm trying to convince him to produce|a play. l think he'll find that satisfying.<br> l like him. l think he's a sweet guy,|the few times that l've met him.<br> Cos he's a loser. He's awkward|and he's clumsy, like me.<br> - l like an underconfident person.|- This is really nice.<br> - He's been wanting a mitt.|- You have good taste in husbands.<br> Thanks. That's a beauty!<br> lsn't that great? Come on, let's go!<br> Go out by the Sung vase and catch this.<br> - Watch the...|- (crash)<br> Hannah's sweet, although sometimes|l still do get angry when l think ofthings.<br> What the hell.|At least l'm not paying child support.<br> God, l hope there's nothing|physically wrong with me.<br> - So what's the problem this time?|- l really think l have something.<br> l'm absolutely convinced.|Not like that adenoidal thing,<br> where l didn't realise l'd had them out.|But l was younger.<br> l saw your father this week about his|sinus and he complained of chest pains.<br> Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac|of the family. He's, you know...<br> - You said you'd had some dizziness.|- Yes, a little.<br> And l think l'm developing|a hearing loss in my right ear.<br> Or my left ear. No, l'm sorry...|My right or my left ear. l can't remember.<br> OK, let's take a look.<br> Well, you have had a significant drop in|the high-decibel range in your right ear.<br> Really?<br> Have you been exposed to|a loud noise recently, or had a virus?<br> No, l've been perfectly healthy. You know|me. l always imagine that l have things.<br> - When did you first notice this?|- About a month ago. What do l have?<br> You've had some dizzy spells.|What about ringing or buzzing?<br> Yes, now that you mention it,<br> l have buzzing and also ringing.|Ringing and buzzing. Am l going deaf?<br> - lt's just in one ear?|- Yes.<br> ls it healthier to have|problems in both ears?<br> l'd like to make an appointment|for you at the hospital.<br> - l'd like to have them run some tests.|- The hospital? What kind of tests?<br> Now, don't get alarmed.<br> These are more sophisticated audiometry|tests than l can run here. lt's nothing.<br> Then why do l have to go|into the hospital at all?<br> l hear fine. So l'm a little weak on the|high decibels. l won't go to the opera.<br> There's no reason for panic.|l just wanna rule out some things.<br> - Like what?|- lt's nothing. Will you trust me?<br> Hello, Dr Wilkes? This is Mickey Sachs.|l wanna ask you a question.<br> - Sure, Mickey. What's up?|- lf you have a hearing loss in one ear,<br> and it's not from a virus or a loud noise|or anything, what are the possibilities?<br> Anything. Often it's hereditary.|Flu. Even a small noise'll do it.<br> Right, but nothing worse?<br> Well, yes, l guess the dark side|of the spectrum is a brain tumour.<br> Really?<br> - OK, so here's the new pages.|- Did Cards get these?<br> - Not yet, no.|- Let's hope it's good.<br> Yeah, really, really.|We'll be down in a minute, OK?<br> - (phone ringing)|- Mickey, what's the matter with you?<br> l feel dizzy, you know? l don't feel well.<br> Do you hear a ringing?|ls there a ringing sound?<br> Yeah, yeah. l hear it, l hear it.<br> - No, not that.|- Hello?<br> Yeah, we're gonna be|working late tonight.<br> No, we'll order out.<br> lf l have a brain tumour,|what am l gonna do?<br> You don't have a brain tumour.|He didn't say you had one.<br> No, they're not gonna tell you because|sometimes the weaker ones will panic.<br> But not you?<br> - Can you hear buzzing?|- Come on, we got a show to do.<br> - l can't keep my mind on the show.|- There's nothing wrong with you.<br> lf there isn't, why does he|want me to come back for tests?<br> - He has to rule out certain things.|- Like what?<br> - l don't know. Cancer.|- Don't say that. l don't wanna hear that.<br> - Don't mention it while l'm in the building.|- You don't have any symptoms.<br> l got the classic symptoms|of a brain tumour.<br> Two months ago you thought|you had a malignant melanoma.<br> Naturally. The sudden appearance|of a black spot on my back.<br> - lt was on your shirt.|- Was l to know? Everyone was pointing.<br> - We've got to make booking decisions.|- l can't think of it.<br> This morning l was so happy.|Now l don't know what went wrong.<br> You were miserable this morning.<br> We got bad reviews, terrible ratings,|the sponsors are furious...<br> No, l was happy, but l just|didn't realise l was happy.<br> (woman) These are delicious!|What are they?<br> - Those are quail eggs. Aren't they good?|- They're very good.<br> My friend April makes those.|Try a shrimp puff.<br> - Oh, thank you. That looks good.|- l make those.<br> Excuse me.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> - The stroganoff is ready.|- We're a big hit!<br> ln this we are. Yesterday l auditioned for|Come Back Little Sheba.

What about years ago?<br> l'm sorry to say, Mr Sachs,|that you cannot have children.<br> Gee.<br> ls there no chance?<br> This doesn't mean that|you can't have a normal sex life,<br> but Mr Sachs' tests indicate|that he is infertile.<br> Small sperm volume and infertile.<br> ls there anything l can do?|Push-ups? Hormones?<br> - l'm afraid not.|- l gotta get a second opinion.<br> - This is the second opinion.|- Well, a third opinion.<br> l realise this is a blow.<br> My experience is that many very fine|marriages become unstable<br> and are destroyed by an inability|to deal with this sort of problem.<br> l hope you won't make too much of it.<br> One can adopt children, and there are|various artificial methods of fertilisation.<br> - l'm so humiliated.|- Could you have ruined yourself?<br> - How could l ruin myself?|- l don't know. Excessive masturbation?<br> Hey, you gonna start|knockin' my hobbies?

How are you doing?<br> l'll get you some coffee.|That's enough of that. What triggered it?<br> We were making a commercial|at the mayor's office.<br> There was this young salesman<br> and your mother was throwing|herself at him in a disgusting way.<br> Then she found she was too old to seduce|him, that he was just embarrassed by her.<br> Liar! Liar!<br> At lunch, she got drunker and drunker,|and finally she became Joan Collins.<br> All my life l've had to put up|with insults from this non-person!<br> This haircut that passes for a man!<br> He could never support us. lt's|a good thing we had a talented daughter.<br> l can only hope that she was mine!<br> With you as her mother, her father|could be anybody in Actors' Equity!<br> She's talented,|so it's unlikely she's yours.<br> Dad, could you stay in the other room|and let me take care of her?<br> You never know when she's gonna fall off|the wagon and humiliate everybody.<br> Here, Mom.

They didn't know anything else.<br> You know, of all of us in the family, you|were the one blessed with the true gift.<br> My true gift is luck, Mom. l just had|a lot of luck, from my first show.<br> l thought Lee was the one|destined for great things.<br> Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't|have your spark.

A secret?|- Yeah, sure.<br> A week ago, l bought a rifle.|l went into a store and bought one.<br> lf l had a tumour, l was gonna kill myself.<br> The only thing that might've stopped me|is my parents would be devastated.<br> l would have had to shoot them first.<br> And then my aunt and uncle.|lt would have been a bloodbath.<br> Well, you know, eventually|it is going to happen to all of us.<br> But doesn't that ruin everything for you?|lt takes the pleasure out of everything.<br> You're gonna die, l'm gonna die, the|audience, the network, the sponsor...<br> - l know, and your hamster.|- Yes!<br> Listen, kid. l think you snapped your cap.<br> Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda|or something, or go to a whorehouse.<br> l can't stay on this show. l need answers.<br> Otherwise, l'm telling you,|l'm gonna do something drastic.<br> - l thought you weren't coming.|- l almost didn't.<br> - l didn't sleep all night.|- No, l'm sure.<br> What are we doing, meeting|in a hotel room? lt's terrible.<br> l couldn't think where to invite you|without taking risks.<br> l promised myself l wouldn't let this|happen till you were living alone.<br> l was so torn when you called.<br> l've wanted to call you every day|since l first told you how l felt.<br> l resisted so many times.<br> Don't think badly of me.<br> This is not an easy situation.<br> l know it isn't.<br> That was just perfect.<br> You've ruined me for anyone else.<br> l don't want anyone else ever to have you.<br> l was so worried|l wouldn't compare with Hannah.<br> Oh, my God. You really do have|those thoughts, don't you?<br> All the time.<br> l know she must be|a really passionate person.<br> Yes, she's very warm and giving,|but it's me that wants to be giving to you.<br> l wanna do things for you.|Hannah doesn't need me as much.<br> Oh, l'm being presumptuous.|Not that you need me...<br> l want you to take care of me.<br> And l love when you do things to me.<br> - You're late.|- Lucy and l kept talking.<br> l didn't realise how late it had got.<br> You missed a very dull|TV show about Auschwitz.<br> More gruesome film clips,|and more puzzled intellectuals<br> declaring their mystification over|the systematic murder of millions.<br> The reason why they can never answer|the question ''How could it happen?''<br> is that it's the wrong question.<br> Given what people are, the question is|''Why doesn't it happen more often?''<br> - Of course, it does, in subtler forms.|- l have a headache from this weather.<br> lt's been ages since|l sat in front of the TV,<br> just changing channels to find something.<br> You see the whole culture:<br> Nazis, deodorant salesmen,<br> wrestlers, beauty contests,|the talk show...<br> Can you imagine the level of|a mind that watches wrestling?<br> But the worst are the fundamentalist|preachers: third-rate con men<br> telling the poor suckers that watch them|that they speak for Jesus.<br> And to please send in money.|Money, money, money.<br> lf Jesus came back and saw|what's going on in his name,<br> - he'd never stop throwing up.|- Oh, God, would you please lighten up?<br> l'm really not in the mood to hear|a review of contemporary society again.<br> - You've been very nervous lately.|- l can't take this any more.<br> l'm trying to complete an education|l started five years ago.<br> l'm not your pupil. l was, but l'm not.<br> When you leave the nest, l want you|to be ready to face the real world.<br> We're going to have to|make some changes.<br> - Like what?|- You know what. l'm suffocating.<br> - Are we having this conversation again?|- Yes, we are having it again.<br> - l have to leave. l have to move out.|- Why?<br> - Because l have to.|- What are you going to use for money?<br> l don't know. l thought maybe l'd|move in with my parents for a while.<br> l always told you you would leave me.|Does it have to be now?<br> Maybe it'll only be temporary,|but l have to try.<br> Oh, Lee.

Just some stuff.|Little of this, little of that.<br> Was that an embarrassing question?|Are you out of work or something?<br> - No, well, l've been trying to write.|- Have you? That's interesting.<br> - What kind of stuff?|- Oh...<br> - You're not interested in this.|- No, you can tell me. l am.<br> Millions must say to you|''l've written something.''<br> - Nobody ever said it. This is it.|- Really?<br> - Would you be willing to read something?|- Yes, if it would mean anything to you.<br> l don't know why it would.|You've always hated my taste in the past.<br> - No, l haven't!|- You have.<br> l think it might make a great television|script, and you're so active in television.<br> Not any more.|l haven't been in television for a year.<br> No, l may have to get back into it cos my|accountant says l'm running out of cash.<br> But no, l sort of dropped out for a year,|which is a long, dull story.<br> - You're OK, though?|- Yes, l'm fine. How are you?<br> - l'm fine.|- What about your script?<br> l'd love it if you'd read it|cos l really would value your opinion.<br> But you have to remember while you're|reading and you're cursing my name<br> that this is my first script.|Well, it's not my first.<br> That was about Hannah and|her husband, but Hannah read it.<br> She got really angry and l felt badly.<br> - l can't imagine what you wrote.|- lt wasn't anything bad, but l don't know...<br> So l threw it out, but l have this other one.<br> Well, you know,|if you want me to, l would read it.<br> l don't know... Could l come over|tomorrow and read it to you?<br> Come over tomorrow and read it to me?|You must be joking!<br> l've been doing|all my own reading since l was 40.<br> l think it's lucky l ran into you. Maybe.<br> What about me? l should have kept going.<br> l have a nagging sensation|that l should have kept walking<br> and not begun this conversation.<br> (Holly) ''We go through life|playing the hand we're dealt.''<br> ''Craig: And what hand were you dealt?''<br> ''Emily: l'm two high pair,|maybe even aces up.''<br> ''The problem is,|you've got three deuces.''<br> That's the end.<br> No, you can tell me straight.|lt's OK. Just tell me what you think.<br> lt's great.<br> l'm... speechless.<br> l was not in the mood|to listen to this thing now.<br> l don't know what to say.|l'm moved and l laughed and l...<br> l was on the edge of my seat.|lt's wonderful.<br> l'm totally stunned. This is not an insult.<br> l'm amazed that you can...|l just thought it was great.<br> - Really?|- Yes. l was absolutely...<br> What made you think|of that climax scene,<br> where the architect is walking home|with his actress girlfriend<br> and the schizophrenic ex-wife|jumps out and stabs him to death?<br> - lt just came to me one day.|- lt was just fabulous.<br> Gosh, you really think l can write?<br> There's one or two things|l would do differently myself,<br> but who cares? lt was fabulous.<br> l mean lt. l'm so impressed!|l am. You've made my day.<br> lt was just great.|l was set to be bored stiff.<br> - Would you like to have lunch?|- l would love to talk about the script.<br> - l think we could do something with it.|- OK.<br> And l'd like to hear what made you|suddenly decide to drop out of life.<br> - Who cares?|- No, l care.<br> You used to be so ambitious and...<br> God, you really liked it?!<br> Gosh, you really went through a crisis,|you know that? How did you get over it?<br> When l ran into you, you seemed|just perfectly fine. You seem fine now.<br> Well, l'll tell you. One day,|about a month ago, l really hit bottom.<br> ljust felt that in a Godless universe,|l didn't want to go on living.<br> Now, l happen to own this rifle, which|l loaded and pressed to my forehead,<br> and l remember thinking.;|l'm gonna kill myself.<br> Then l thought.; what ifl'm wrong?<br> What ifthere is a God?|After all, nobody really knows that.<br> But then l thought.;|no, maybe is not good enough.<br> l want certainty or nothing.<br> And l remember very clearly|the clock was ticking<br> and l was sitting there, frozen,|with the gun to my head,<br> debating whether to shoot.<br> (gunshot)<br> All ofa sudden, the gun went off. l had|been so tense, l'd squeezed the trigger.<br> But l was perspiring so much, the gun|had slid offmy forehead and missed me.<br> - (gunshot)|- Neighbours were pounding on the door<br> and, l don't know, the whole scene|wasjust pandemonium.<br> And l ran to the door, l didn't know what|to say. l was embarrassed and confused.<br> My mind was racing a mile a minute,|and ljust knew one thing.<br> l had to get out ofthat house, just|get out in the fresh air and clear my head.<br> And l remember very clearly|l walked the streets.<br> l didn't know what was going through my|mind. lt all seemed so violent and unreal.<br> And l wandered for a long time|on the Upper West Side.<br> lt must have been hours. My feet hurt and|my head was pounding. l had to sit down.<br> l went into a movie house. l didn't know|what was playing. ljust needed a moment<br> to gather my thoughts and be logical<br> and put the world|back into rational perspective.<br> ( playing a tune)<br> And l went upstairs|to the balcony and l sat down.<br> The movie was a film that l'd seen|many times in my life since l was a kid,<br> and l always loved it.<br> And l'm watching these people|up on the screen<br> and l started getting hooked on the film.<br> And l started to feel.; how can you even|think ofkilling yourself?. lsn't that stupid?<br> Look at all the people on the screen.<br> They're real funny, and|what ifthe worst is true?<br> What ifthere's no God and you|only go around once and that's it?<br> Don't you want to be|part ofthe experience?<br> What the hell? lt's not all a drag.<br> l'm thinking to myself.;|l should stop ruining my life,<br> searching for answers l'm never gonna|get, andjust enjoy it while it lasts.<br> And after, who knows? Maybe there|is something. Nobody really knows.<br> l know ''maybe'' is a slim reed to hang|your life on, but it's the best we have.<br> Then l started to sit back and|l actually began to enjoy myself.<br> Oh, Freedonia<br> Oh, don't you cry for me<br> Cos l'm coming round the mountain<br> Um...<br> Look, there's something that's been|bothering me for a long time.<br> l just thought l'd tell you what it was|and just sort of clear the deck here.<br> l've always regretted the way l behaved|that evening we went out.<br> - l just thought l'd tell you that...|- Don't be silly. Don't be ridiculous.<br> l was the... You know, it was my fault.<br> So you wanna go out to dinner again?|Do you have any interest in that?<br> - Sure.|- Are you free this evening?<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> l want ice! Who's got some?<br> Oh, there it is.<br> Hey, where's Holly? She's late.<br> Did you read Holly's last thing?|She's really developed.<br> She really writes good dialogue.<br> Hannah, can l say you're|going to play Desdemona?<br> - Mom, it's only television.|- But it's public television.<br> To me, Shakespeare doesn't|get any greater than Othello.<br> - You with some big, black stud. l love it!|- Oh, honey!<br> (Elliot) Oh, Lee. You are something.<br> You look very beautiful.|Marriage agrees with you.<br> Everything that happened between us|seems more and more hazy.<br> l acted like such a fool.|l don't know what came over me.<br> The complete conviction|that l couldn't live without you.<br> What l put us both through!<br> And Hannah, who, as you once said,|l love much more than l realised.<br> Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!<br> - Hi, Daisy. l didn't miss dinner, did l?|- No.<br> Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving!<br> Happy Thanksgiving, Amy.<br> ( piano playing ''lsn't lt Romantic'')<br> lt's beautiful.<br> - Don't be nervous. lt's your husband.|- Hi.<br> - Hi. How are you doing?|- OK.<br> - When did you get here?|- Just a few minutes ago.<br> - You look so beautiful.|- Thanks.<br> l was talking to your father before.|l was telling him that it's ironic.<br> l used to always have|Thanksgiving with Hannah.<br> l never thought that|l could love anybody else.<br> And here it is, years later, and l'm married|to you, and completely in love with you.<br> The heart is a very,|very resilient little muscle.<br> lt would make a great story, l think. A guy|marries one sister and it doesn't work out.<br> Then, years later,|he winds up married to the other sister.<br> l don't know how you're gonna top that.<br> - Mickey?|- What?<br> l'm pregnant.<br>
