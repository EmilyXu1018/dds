                        After you.<br> Is this 348?<br> Yes, it is.<br> I've got a special delivery<br> here. That sounds interesting.<br> It's for Dowd. Dowd's my name. Elwood P.<br> Here, sir. Let me give you one of my cards.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> Just sign right here. Uh-huh.<br> Beautiful day. Every day's a beautiful day.<br> Thank you.<br> He was a nice man.<br> Come on.<br> Thank heavens<br> he's gone!<br> Oh, Myrtle, it's<br> a wonderful feeling...<br> to have your relative out of the<br> house before the company comes.<br> You're sure Uncle Elwood won't<br> come back and spoil everything?<br> Of course not, dear. Your uncle<br> always spends the afternoon...<br> downtown at those filthy bars<br> and taverns, you know that.<br> I'll go tell the cateress<br> to get started.<br> Why, Miss Johnson, what<br> are you doing? Leaving.<br> Miss Johnson, you were hired<br> to serve as well as cater.<br> Our guests will be here any<br> minute. Now, Miss Johnson...<br> Myrtle, let me handle this,<br> dear. Miss Johnson, what's wrong?<br> There was a man here a minute ago<br> and he stopped and he spoke to me.<br> You didn't tell him anything about our<br> party, did you? I didn't tell him nothin'!<br> He gave me his card. Here. And<br> then he introduced me to somebody.<br> To whom? Do you think I'd<br> stay in this house after that?<br> Um, well...<br> Oh!<br> People get run over by trucks every day.<br> Why can't that happen to Uncle Elwood?<br> Myrtle Mae Simmons,<br> I'm ashamed of you!<br> Even if people do call your uncle<br> peculiar, he is still my baby brother...<br> and this is not his<br> fault. Whose fault is it?<br> We'll get the cook to do the<br> serving. Come and lend me a hand.<br> We haven't got much time.<br> Elvira!<br> If it isn't his fault,<br> whose fault is it?<br> I know whose fault it is, but I'm<br> not telling. You're not telling?<br> Elvira?<br> Elvira, you can bring<br> those things in now.<br> Mother, why can't we live<br> like other people?<br> Do I have<br> to keep reminding you...<br> your Uncle Elwood is not living<br> with us, we're living with him?<br> Living with him and his pal! You promised!<br> - His pal Harvey!<br> - Oh, you said that name.<br> You promised you wouldn't say<br> that name and you said it!<br> Mother, why did grandmother leave<br> all her property to Uncle Elwood?<br> I suppose it was because<br> she died in his arms.<br> People are sentimental<br> about things like that.<br> You always say that<br> and it doesn't make sense.<br> She couldn't make out a will after<br> she died, could she? Don't be didactic.<br> It's not becoming in a young<br> girl. Besides, men loathe it.<br> Men! A fine chance<br> I've got!<br> Dear, the whole idea of this<br> party this afternoon is to...<br> Is to get you started socially, so<br> that you can meet some nice young men.<br> What's the use?<br> Myrtle Mae Simmons,<br> her uncle, Elwood P. Dowd,<br> is the biggest screw...<br> Screwball in town!<br> Who'd want me?<br> Myrtle, dear, you're sweet<br> and you have so much to offer.<br> I don't care what anyone says, there's<br> something sweet about every young girl.<br> And a man takes that sweetness<br> and look what he does with it!<br> Oh, show some poise, dear. I<br> want you to charm Mrs. Chauvenet.<br> She has a grandson<br> just about your age.<br> A lot of good that'll do if Uncle Elwood<br> comes home. Uncle Elwood won't be home.<br> Or will he? I'm going to telephone<br> Judge Gaffney. We can't take any chances.<br> Mother,<br> you better hurry!<br> Mrs. Halsey and Miss<br> Tewksbury are here already.<br> Oh, dear.<br> Yes, dear, I am hurrying.<br> Hurry, Mother. They're<br> getting out of the car.<br> Oh...<br> Judge Gaffney, please.<br> Mrs. Veta Simmons calling.<br> Yes?<br> Oh, put her on.<br> Veta, my girl,<br> this is a pleasure.<br> Judge, we haven't got<br> a moment to lose.<br> I'm having the Wednesday Forum over<br> for a program tea for Ethel Chauvenet.<br> Elwood has just gone out, but<br> I'm so afraid he may come back.<br> You can understand why.<br> Oh!<br> Hello, Miss Tewksbury,<br> Mrs. Halsey.<br> Go right into the drawing room.<br> Myrtle, take their things.<br> Yes, you've got to help me,<br> Judge.<br> You've got to help me.<br> I can't...<br> Speak up, Veta!<br> What? I can't make out...<br> Is that so?<br> Oh, yoo-hoo, Mrs. Streickelberger.<br> Hello, Mrs. Simmons.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> Yes, that'll be all right.<br> You can depend on me.<br> All right.<br> Minninger, in a few minutes, a<br> man will be crossing the square.<br> He'll be wearing a hat and coat and<br> carrying another one over his arms.<br> I want you to follow him. If necessary,<br> even confront him, quietly, of course.<br> But at all events, I want you to<br> prevent him from returning to his house.<br> His sister is giving a party. He wouldn't<br> fit in. His name is Elwood P. Dowd.<br> Elwood Dowd, sir! Couldn't<br> you get someone else?<br> Kratke maybe or Beck?<br> They're bigger than I am.<br> You'll be able to hide better. Hurry and<br> stick with him all afternoon. Quickly, boy.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Oh, elevator!<br> Come in.<br> Yes?<br> Who is it?<br> Oh! The doctor<br> will see you in a minute.<br> Good afternoon, Mr. Dowd. Howdy do?<br> We must be<br> more careful.<br> After you.<br> How do, Mr. Dowd? Afternoon, Mr. Cracker.<br> Excuse me.<br> How is he? Oh, he's just<br> fine, fine. How are you?<br> Oh, can't complain.<br> That's good.<br> Is this all right?<br> You sure, hmm?<br> Well, all right. Give you a hand<br> there. Whoop, don't slip! There.<br> You sure this is all right? You<br> wouldn't rather sit in a booth?<br> Well, all right. Would he prefer a booth?<br> Thank you, Mr. Cracker. He<br> seems to prefer the bar today.<br> Good afternoon<br> to you, sir.<br> Mr. Meegles is back. Oh!<br> Well!<br> You...<br> Excuse me a minute.<br> Mr. Meegles, this is a<br> pleasure! We've missed you.<br> How are you, Mr. Dowd? Fine.<br> And how is he? Oh, he's<br> splendid, thank you. Splendid.<br> He decided he wanted to come over<br> here this afternoon, so here we are.<br> Sit down. Oh, thank you. You've been away.<br> For 90 days. Been doin' a job for<br> the state. Makin' license plates.<br> Oh, is that so?<br> Interesting work?<br> I can take it or leave it alone. Oh, I see.<br> I did a job for 'em last year<br> too. Helpin' 'em build a road.<br> Oh. Well, Mr. Meegles, we'll just<br> have to do something about your return.<br> Would you like to come to<br> my house for dinner tonight?<br> Oh, thanks, Mr. Dowd,<br> but I couldn't make it tonight.<br> Ah, tomorrow night?<br> Would that suit you?<br> Yes, yes! But you know,<br> the last time I was there...<br> I kinda got the impression your sister held<br> it against me because I did a little time.<br> Oh, no. My sister loves to<br> entertain. She's very social.<br> Yes, I see by the papers. You know<br> I never miss the society column.<br> You don't? No. She's giving<br> a clambake this afternoon.<br> This afternoon?<br> Yeah.<br> "Reception, program and tea,"<br> it says here,<br> "for the members of the Wednesday Afternoon<br> Forum," for that rich Mrs. "Shuvanut."<br> Cheva... Yes,<br> that's Aunt Ethel.<br> Is this today's paper?<br> Veta didn't tell me anything about<br> this. Must've slipped her mind.<br> Well, I'll see you tomorrow<br> night at 7:00, Mr. Meegles, huh?<br> Thanks, Mr. Dowd. Very glad<br> to have seen you. Good-bye.<br> Harvey,<br> I just found out...<br> Now, what can I do for you?<br> What did you have in mind?<br> What's your order?<br> Two martinis.<br> Two martinis.<br> Harvey, it seems that Veta is<br> having a party this afternoon.<br> And l...<br> Hmm? Oh, you knew?<br> Well, I just thought she might<br> be offended if we weren't there.<br> After all, she's the only sister<br> I have and l... How's that?<br> And the only one I'm ever likely to<br> have. Yes, you're absolutely right.<br> We'd better hurry, huh?<br> That'll be<br> four bits.<br> The one at the end will pay<br> for it. Oh, he'd be delighted.<br> He'd be delighted.<br> Well...<br> let's drink up.<br> My love<br> Will take me flying<br> to the sky<br> On a steed<br> with golden wings<br> And then<br> we'll ride away<br> Forever high<br> on the moon<br> On a star<br> on a cloud<br> In his arms<br> I will stay<br> Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh<br> Ahh<br> Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity<br> hop on a golden steed<br> Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity<br> hop Love is all I need<br> Ahh-ah, ahh-ah<br> Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity<br> hop on a golden steed<br> Hop, hop, hop, hop hippity<br> hop Love is all I need<br> Mother.<br> Shh-shh.<br> Mrs. Chauvenet is here.<br> Mrs. Chauvenet is here? Oh.<br> Aunt Ethel! Veta Louise<br> Simmons, I thought you were dead.<br> Oh, no! I'm very much alive, thank you.<br> And this is my daughter<br> Myrtle Mae.<br> My dear, you're your grandmother<br> all over again. I was at her funeral.<br> And now, where is Elwood?<br> Elwood couldn't be home.<br> That's Miss Tewksbury singing.<br> She'll be through in a minute.<br> Oh, shame on him! That was the main<br> reason I came. I want to see Elwood.<br> Do you realize, Veta,<br> I haven't seen Elwood in years?<br> I was saying to Mr. Chauvenet...<br> What do you want, my dear?<br> Just the other night, "What on earth<br> do you think happened to Elwood Dowd?<br> "He never comes to<br> the Yale Alumni Dances anymore.<br> I haven't seen him at the club<br> or the horse show in years."<br> Does Elwood see anybody<br> these days?<br> Yes, Aunt Ethel, Elwood sees<br> somebody. Yes, Aunt Ethel, he does.<br> Is Elwood happy,<br> Veta Louise?<br> Oh, yes, Aunt Ethel, Elwood's<br> very happy. You mustn't worry.<br> There's Mrs. Cummings.<br> She's waving at you.<br> Is that Mrs. Frank Cummings? Doesn't<br> she look ghastly? I thought she was dead.<br> I must get a closer look.<br> We can go in now. What did I do with my...<br> Oh, there it is.<br> Oh, no!<br> Elwood! Elwood Dowd!<br> Bless your heart!<br> Aunt Ethel.<br> What a pleasure...<br> to find a beautiful woman waiting<br> for me. Elwood, you haven't changed.<br> Elwood!<br> Well, you both<br> look lovely.<br> Some mail came for you. It looked<br> important so I put it up in your room.<br> Did you, Veta?<br> That was nice of you.<br> Aunt Ethel, I'd like to have<br> you meet a very dear...<br> Aunt Ethel, don't you want some<br> tea? Not just now, thank you.<br> There's punch if you don't<br> like tea. But I do like tea.<br> Stop pulling me,<br> you two.<br> Elwood, what night next week can you come<br> to dinner? You and Veta and Myrtle Mae?<br> I'll have Ordway there.<br> Ordway is my grandson.<br> Any night at all, I'd be<br> delighted. I'd like to meet Ordway.<br> And now, Aunt Ethel,<br> I'd like you to meet Harvey!<br> Harvey, you've heard me speak of Aunt<br> Ethel Chauvenet. One of my dearest friends.<br> She's the one who...<br> Hmm?<br> Th-That's right. Well, this<br> is the one. No, she's the one!<br> She... He says he would've<br> known you anywhere.<br> Well, now we must go in and<br> greet the rest of our friends.<br> Come along, Harvey.<br> Oh, Aunt Ethel,<br> will you pardon me?<br> You're standing<br> in his way.<br> There we are.<br> I'll see you in a minute.<br> I can see that you're disturbed<br> about Harvey. Please don't be.<br> He stares that way at<br> everybody. It's his way.<br> But he likes you, I can<br> tell. He likes you very much.<br> I'm, I'm coming, Harvey.<br> Well, I... I think<br> I'll be running along.<br> No tea? Or punch? No, no. Thank you.<br> Perhaps a nice lemon fizz...<br> I'll be going. Good-bye.<br> with a turkey wing<br> and some walnut dressing?<br> Oh, no!<br> Elwood.<br> Oh, no.<br> Not Mrs. Halsey.<br> She has a nephew. He's a little bit<br> old, but he would have done in a pinch.<br> She has a nephew. He's a little bit<br> old, but he would have done in a pinch.<br> Oh, Mother, I can't face<br> those people. I just can't!<br> Your uncle has disgraced us for the last<br> time in this house. I'm going to see to that.<br> You're no match for him.<br> He always gets the best of you.<br> Where are you going? Upstairs to pack.<br> I'm going to lose myself in some strange<br> city. I'm going to change my name!<br> Don't do that yet,<br> dear!<br> Wait until I telephone<br> Judge Gaff... Judge Gaffney.<br> I'm going to do something<br> I should've done long ago.<br> I don't understand it, Veta. Mr.<br> Minninger is as trustworthy as the Bible.<br> I don't know anything about<br> your Mr. Minninger.<br> But I do know Elwood Dowd when I see<br> him and he's here. He's here, I tell you.<br> If you insist he's there, then I must<br> act on the assumption that he's there.<br> Minninger!<br> You failed!<br> I didn't fail, Judge.<br> I haven't tried yet.<br> I've been in<br> the doctor's office.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> Hold on, Judge.<br> Mrs. Halsey, Mrs. Krausmeyer.<br> You're not leaving, are you?<br> I just remembered the horse show<br> is today. Good-bye. It's been jolly.<br> Won't you join us<br> tomorrow night?<br> Harvey and I are having a<br> few people in for Mr. Meegles.<br> Forgive me, Mrs. Simmons. One of my<br> stupid headaches. Such a lovely party.<br> Good-bye, good-bye.<br> Elwood, I'd like to talk...<br> W-W-W...<br> There.<br> There we are.<br> I'd like to talk to you, Elwood.<br> I like to talk to you too.<br> This is very important. Would<br> you mind coming into the library?<br> Oh, of course, Veta.<br> Elwood, I want<br> to talk to you.<br> Oh!<br> I want you to wait here.<br> Don't move. I'll be right back.<br> Certainly, sister. I happen<br> to have a little free time now.<br> You're welcome to all of it,<br> Veta. Want Harvey to wait too?<br> Oh, yes! Yes, Elwood.<br> I certainly do.<br> Hello! Speak up, I say.<br> Did you say something,<br> Harvey? Who said that?<br> Veta Louise, are you there?<br> Are you there, girl?<br> Hello? Veta?<br> Hello.<br> Who is it please?<br> Oh, Judge, I'm so glad you<br> called. I was going to call you.<br> Oh, um... Omar,<br> we've got to take those steps<br> we discussed once.<br> Yes. I want you to make<br> all the arrangements.<br> Yes.<br> By all means, yes.<br> That was Omar. We've been<br> neglecting the Judge lately.<br> Veta, do you know that it's been weeks<br> since Harvey and I've been up to his office?<br> Let's go tomorrow, shall we?<br> Elwood, you and I may take a ride.<br> Oh, I'd like that! Only<br> the other day Harvey said,<br> "It's certainly been a long time<br> since we've been for a drive."<br> You're sweet and thoughtful. Don't<br> forget to wait for me. I'll be right back.<br> Make yourself comfortable,<br> Harvey.<br> There.<br> All right?<br> Veta wants to talk to us.<br> She, uh,<br> says it's very important.<br> I think she wants<br> to congratulate us...<br> on the impression we made<br> at her party.<br> Jane Austin.<br> Sense and Sensibility.<br> Hmm?<br> Oh...<br> Random House.<br> No, deluxe edition.<br> Usual acknowledgments.<br> Chapter One.<br> "The family of Dashwood had<br> been long settled in Sussex..."<br> Will you wait here for me,<br> Elwood, dear?<br> You want both of us to<br> wait? Oh, yes, both of you.<br> I won't be long.<br> Driver, driver, will you<br> keep an eye on him, please?<br> I won't be but a minute.<br> Charming place, isn't<br> it, Harvey? Name's Henry.<br> It's Henry, Harvey.<br> No, just plain Henry.<br> Hmm, oh!<br> My name's Dowd, Elwood P.<br> Let me give you one<br> of my cards.<br> If you should ever want to<br> call me, call me at this number.<br> Don't call me at that one.<br> That's the old one.<br> If you happen to lose the card,<br> don't worry, I have plenty more.<br> Mrs. O.R. Simmons. 348<br> Temple Drive. Is that right?<br> Yes. We were born<br> and raised there.<br> It's old, but we love it.<br> It's our home.<br> And you wish to enter your brother<br> at the sanitarium for treatment?<br> What is your brother's<br> name? It's... Oh, dear.<br> Mrs. Simmons,<br> what is your brother's name?<br> I'm sorry. Life is<br> not easy for any of us.<br> It's Dowd.<br> Elwood P. Dowd.<br> Elwood P. Dowd.<br> His age?<br> Forty-two<br> the 24th of last April.<br> He's Taurus,<br> Taurus the bull.<br> I'm Leo, and Myrtle's on the<br> cusp. You have him with you now?<br> Oh, yes. He's outside<br> waiting in a taxi cab.<br> I told him to wait. He<br> always does what I tell him.<br> I see. Is he married?<br> No, Elwood never married.<br> He always stayed with<br> Mother. He loved his home.<br> Yeah? Wilson, there's a<br> Mr. Dowd outside in a cab.<br> Will you ask him if he'll be good enough<br> to step up to room 24 South Wing "G"?<br> Ask him? Wilson, this is<br> his sister, Mrs. Simmons.<br> Oh, how do?<br> Why certainly.<br> I'll be glad to escort him.<br> I'll see if Dr. Sanderson<br> can see you, Mrs. Simmons.<br> Dr. Sanderson? I want to<br> see Dr. Chumley himself.<br> Dr. Sanderson is the one who sees<br> everybody. Dr. Chumley sees no one.<br> I'll tell him<br> you're here.<br> l-lsn't this wonderful, Veta? Okay, buddy!<br> Oh, you startled me!<br> I'm sorry, Mrs. Simmons.<br> I am Dr. Sanderson. Oh.<br> Miss Kelly tells me you're concerned<br> about your brother, Mister, uh, Mister...<br> The card, Miss Kelly.<br> Miss Kelly!<br> The card, please.<br> Mr. Dowd? Elwood P. Dowd. This way.<br> I'm sorry if I awakened you,<br> Miss Kelly.<br> I'm so...<br> I do hope you don't think<br> I'm always as jumpy as this.<br> This is not easy for me,<br> Doctor.<br> These things aren't easy<br> for the family. I understand.<br> Won't you sit down,<br> Miss Simmons? Thank you.<br> How long has it been since you first noticed<br> any peculiarity in your brother's actions?<br> As a baby,<br> he was perfectly normal.<br> I know. I was his big sister<br> and I had to change him.<br> Babies do need changing,<br> you know.<br> I noticed that he seemed<br> to be different...<br> after we came back<br> after Mother had died.<br> Myrtle Mae and I came back from<br> Des Moines to live with Elwood.<br> I could see that he...<br> That he...<br> That he what?<br> Take your time.<br> Don't strain.<br> Just, just let it come.<br> I'll wait for it.<br> Doctor, everything I say to<br> you is confidential, isn't it?<br> I am not a gossip. I am<br> a psychiatrist. Of course.<br> For one thing, he<br> drinks. Mm-hmm. To excess?<br> To excess?<br> Don't you call it excess when<br> a man never lets a day go by...<br> without stepping<br> into some cheap tavern,<br> bringing home a lot of riffraff,<br> people you never heard of?<br> If you don't call that excess, Doctor,<br> I'm sure I don't know what excess is.<br> I didn't doubt<br> your statement.<br> I merely wanted to know<br> if your brother drinks.<br> Yes, I say definitely<br> Elwood drinks. Mm-hmm.<br> I want him committed<br> out here permanently...<br> because I cannot stand<br> another day of that Harvey!<br> Don't you think it would have been<br> a little bit kinder of Mother...<br> if she'd written us about<br> him. Now, be honest. Don't you?<br> I really couldn't answer<br> that question. I can!<br> Yes, it certainly<br> would have.<br> This person<br> that you call Harvey,<br> who is he?<br> He's a rabbit.<br> Yes, perhaps.<br> But just who is he?<br> Someone your brother picked up<br> in one of these bars?<br> I've been telling you,<br> Harvey is a rabbit!<br> A big white rabbit six feet high,<br> or is it six feet, three and a half?<br> Heaven knows, I ought to know. He's<br> been around the house long enough!<br> Mrs. Simmons, if I'm not<br> mistaken... Don't you understand?<br> The rabbit's name<br> is Harvey.<br> Harvey lives<br> at our house.<br> Elwood buys theater tickets and<br> railroad tickets for both of them.<br> He's lost interest<br> in everything else.<br> And here I am trying to get<br> Myrtle Mae started...<br> with a nice group<br> of young people.<br> That's my daughter.<br> Doctor,<br> I'm going to tell you something<br> I've never told anyone in this world.<br> Not even Myrtle Mae.<br> Every once in a while, I see<br> this big white rabbit myself!<br> Isn't that terrible!<br> And what's more, he's every<br> bit as big as Elwood says he is!<br> Don't ever tell that to anybody,<br> Doctor. I'm ashamed of it.<br> I can see that you've been under<br> a great nervous strain lately.<br> You just try living with those two<br> and see how much of a strain it is.<br> Your mother's death, it<br> depressed you considerably.<br> Nobody knows how much.<br> Don't you worry. I'm going<br> to help you. Oh, Doctor!<br> Miss Kelly. Miss Kelly!<br> Wilson? Wilson!<br> Don't you move. You just sit there<br> and make yourself comfortable.<br> I'll only be a minute. Yes.<br> Wilson? Wilson!<br> Hello?<br> Lady, you told me to keep an eye on that<br> fella, but a big guy in a white coat came...<br> That's quite all right.<br> You just wait.<br> Do you want I should do<br> something about his suitcase?<br> Oh, Elwood's things. Yes, I<br> better come get them, I guess.<br> He might need them. Oh dear, it would<br> be awful if he should get hurt and...<br> She picked a fine time to leave her desk<br> just when I've got a new patient in my office.<br> Mrs. Simmons?<br> Mrs. Simmons!<br> Sound the gong. That poor woman mustn't<br> leave the grounds. Made a getaway, huh, Doc?<br> Her condition is serious. Go after her<br> and take her to 13 Upper West "R." Right.<br> Where is she? That little dame<br> that just came out, where'd she go?<br> She's picking some posies. She wants<br> to bring 'em to somebody inside.<br> Mac, is it safe for me<br> to wait around?<br> I don't see no bars on these<br> windows. Don't need 'em.<br> Anybody tries to climb through those<br> windows will sound like a three-alarm fire.<br> Hello, sweetheart.<br> Well, well. Those for me?<br> For you? I should say not.<br> They're for my brother Elwood.<br> He's devoted to ranunculus. Sure.<br> Wouldn't you like to come inside<br> and pick some off the wallpaper?<br> No, thank you. These<br> will do nicely. Good day.<br> Lady. Come, lady. Now, really, l...<br> There's a man inside wants to<br> talk to you. No, I don't... No!<br> No! You let me go! Help. Help! Police!<br> What do we want with the police,<br> love boat? They're no fun.<br> You let me go! I'm a respectable<br> woman! That's for sure.<br> Come on, lady, be nice or I'll<br> have to pick you up and carry you.<br> Help!<br> Oh, Dr. Sanderson!<br> Judge Gaffney!<br> How about giving me a hand,<br> beautiful?<br> I'll sit on her.<br> You can strip her clothes off.<br> You'll have to wait. I've got<br> to give some guy a bubble bath.<br> Okay, honey,<br> but make it snappy.<br> Somebody help me!<br> Doc, that Simmons dame's all<br> set. Yeah, no trouble at all.<br> That's fine. I'll be right up and<br> prescribe some preliminary treatment.<br> Don't you ever stay in your office?<br> I needed you! I had to give a hypo.<br> Telephone this Elwood P. Dowd right<br> away. His sister's condition is serious.<br> But, Doctor, l... He'll have to<br> sign these commitment papers for her.<br> I didn't know the woman needed the<br> treatment. She said it was her brother.<br> Of course she did! That's<br> the oldest dodge in the world.<br> Always used by<br> a cunning type of psychopath.<br> She knew her brother was about to commit<br> her, so she came here to discredit him.<br> Get him on the phone, please. I<br> thought the woman was all right...<br> so I had Wilson take the<br> brother up to 24 South Wing "G."<br> He's there now. You had<br> Wilson take the brother in?<br> Come on, no gags, please.<br> You're not serious, are you?<br> I did, Doctor. I did.<br> Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.<br> Oh, you're terribly sorry! Well,<br> that's fine! That fixes everything!<br> That's just wonderful!<br> Oh, no! Kelly! Kelly, do<br> you realize what you've done?<br> This man Dowd can sue us for false<br> commitment! He can own the sanitarium!<br> And I'll be kicked outta here faster than you<br> can say "stupid, incompetent and inefficient."<br> I'll tell Dr. Chumley you had nothing<br> to do with it. It was all my fault.<br> You're the last person I'd ever<br> want anything like this to happen to.<br> You know that,<br> don't you?<br> This is hardly the time or place to go into<br> the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.<br> Lately, Doctor, there's<br> never any time or place!<br> Jeepers! They may be putting him in<br> the hydro room right now. Get him down!<br> I'll break the news to Dr.<br> Chumley. He may want to handle this.<br> What shall I say to Mr. Dowd?<br> What'll I do?<br> He'll probably be so furious<br> he'll refuse to come down.<br> He's probably fit to be tied,<br> but he's a man, isn't he?<br> I guess so.<br> His name is "Mister."<br> Then go into your routine. You<br> know, the eyes, the swish, the works!<br> I'm immune to it, but I've seen it work<br> on some people. Some of the patients!<br> You get him down here<br> if you have to do a striptease.<br> Dr. Chumley, I'm afraid<br> there's been a serious error.<br> Dr. Sanderson, we don't permit<br> errors in this institution.<br> Mr. Dowd?<br> Elwood P. Here, let me<br> give you one of my cards.<br> Mr. Dowd, I'm Miss Kelly. I'm<br> at the reception desk downstairs.<br> I'm happy to know you, Miss<br> Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Dowd.<br> I was wondering if you would come<br> downstairs with me to Dr. Sanderson's office.<br> There's something he'd like to<br> explain to you. Uh-huh. I'd be glad to.<br> But there was another very charming<br> girl in here. And she asked me to wait.<br> She said something<br> about a bath.<br> I don't like to disappoint her. She<br> seemed to have her heart set on it.<br> That was Miss Dunphy.<br> It's quite all right, Mr. Dowd.<br> Dr. Sanderson will explain everything<br> in his office. Well, here we are.<br> Tsk-tsk. Mr. Dowd,<br> you haven't peeled yet.<br> And I regret this, but Miss Kelly<br> seems to want me to go with her.<br> Miss Kelly, you've met<br> Miss Dunphy? Yes, of course.<br> I want you to meet a very dear... There's<br> been a mistake. Just forget everything.<br> I have a suggestion. Why don't I do<br> what she wants, and then go with you?<br> That won't be necessary, Mr.<br> Dowd. All right. Good-bye, my dear.<br> You could've had<br> a bath too.<br> I've already had a bath. Oh, I wasn't<br> speaking to you. I was speaking to my fr...<br> Mr. Dowd, I take a bath every<br> morning just before I go on duty.<br> It's always such a pleasant way<br> to start the day.<br> Oh, after you.<br> Mr. Dowd?<br> Elwood P.<br> Let me give you one<br> of my cards.<br> I am Dr. Lyman Sanderson, Dr.<br> Chumley's assistant. And l...<br> Good for you! Happy to know you. Yes.<br> I asked Miss Kelly to bring you<br> down here... Isn't she lovely?<br> You're very lovely,<br> my dear.<br> Why thank you! Some people<br> don't seem to think so.<br> Well, some people are blind. That's<br> very often brought to my attention.<br> I'd like both of you to meet a very dear<br> friend of mine... Why can't we sit down?<br> Won't you have a chair?<br> Well, thank you very much.<br> There we are.<br> Please, sit down.<br> After Miss Kelly.<br> No, really, Mr. Dowd. I couldn't. I'm<br> in and out. But you sit down, please.<br> After you.<br> Sit down, Kelly!<br> Anything we can do for you, Mr.<br> Dowd? What did you have in mind?<br> Is your chair comfortable? Is the<br> chair quite comfortable, Mr. Dowd?<br> Yes. Care to try it? No, no, no,<br> thank you. How 'bout a cigarette?<br> No, thank you.<br> Yes, a cigarette...<br> Mr. Dowd, you have us<br> at a disadvantage here.<br> You know it and we know it, so<br> let's lay our cards on the table.<br> That appeals<br> to me, Doctor.<br> Best thing in the long run. People<br> are people no matter where you go.<br> That is very often<br> the case.<br> And being human,<br> are liable to make mistakes.<br> Miss Kelly and I, we've made a mistake<br> this afternoon and we'd like to explain it.<br> The truth is... You and Miss Kelly here?<br> Yes.<br> Out here this afternoon? Yes, Mr. Dowd.<br> We hope you'll understand. Oh, yes, yes.<br> These things are often the basis<br> of a very long, warm friendship.<br> It wasn't Dr. Sanderson's<br> fault. It was mine.<br> No, the responsibility<br> is all mine!<br> Your attitude may be old-fashioned,<br> but I like it very much.<br> Of course, If I had seen<br> your sister first,<br> this would've been<br> an entirely different story.<br> There you surprise me.<br> I think the world and all of Veta,<br> but I had supposed she'd seen her day.<br> You mustn't attach too much blame<br> to her. She's a very sick woman.<br> She came in here insisting that you needed<br> treatment. That's perfectly ridiculous.<br> Veta shouldn't be upset<br> about me. I get along fine.<br> She was extremely upset and plunged right<br> away into a heated tirade about your drinking.<br> Ahh!<br> That was Veta.<br> I tell Veta not to worry about<br> that. I'll take care of that.<br> Exactly! Oh, I suppose that you take a<br> drink now and then like the rest of us.<br> M-M-M-M...<br> Yes, yes I do, Doctor.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> I'd like one right now.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> so would I.<br> But her reaction to the whole<br> matter was entirely too intense.<br> Does she drink, Mr. Dowd?<br> Oh, no, oh, no. I don't think<br> Veta's ever taken a drink.<br> I am going to surprise you. I<br> think she has and does constantly.<br> She... Is that...<br> Well, I certainly<br> am surprised at that.<br> Her alcoholism isn't<br> the basis for my diagnosis.<br> It was when she became so emotional<br> about this big white rabbit Harvey.<br> Yes, I believe she called<br> him Harvey. Harvey's his name!<br> Doctor, before we go any<br> further, I must insist...<br> that you and Miss Kelly allow me<br> to introduce you to a friend...<br> Let me make my point.<br> I think your sister's condition<br> stems from trauma.<br> From what? Trauma.<br> Spelled T-R-A-U-M-A.<br> It means shock. There's<br> nothing unusual about it.<br> There's the birth trauma,<br> or the shock of being born.<br> That's the one<br> we never get over.<br> You have a very nice sense of humor.<br> Hasn't he, Miss Kelly? Oh, he certainly has!<br> May I say the same<br> for both of you?<br> Your sister's condition is<br> serious, but I can help her.<br> She must, however, remain<br> out here temporarily.<br> Uh-huh. Well, I've always wanted Veta<br> to have everything she needs. Exactly!<br> But I wouldn't want her to stay here<br> unless she likes it and wants to stay here.<br> If this were an ordinary delusion on the<br> memory picture, that would be one thing.<br> But this is<br> much more serious.<br> It stands to reason no one has ever<br> seen a white rabbit six feet high.<br> Not very often,<br> Doctor.<br> So she must be committed<br> here temporarily.<br> Under the circumstances, I'd<br> commit my own grandmother.<br> Does your grandmother<br> drink too?<br> That's just an expression.<br> Here are the commitment papers for you<br> to sign, and here's a visitor's pass.<br> You can come and see her<br> whenever you like.<br> I think you better<br> have Veta do this.<br> She always does all the signing and<br> managing for our family. She's good at it.<br> I'll have your family lawyer<br> take care of it. Judge Gaffney.<br> He's already telephoned us in<br> connection with this matter.<br> Is that so?<br> Yes.<br> I like you, Dowd. Well,<br> I like you too, Doctor.<br> And Miss Kelly here.<br> I certainly do like you.<br> Why, thank you,<br> Mr. Dowd.<br> You two have been so pleasant,<br> why don't we keep on going?<br> I'd like to invite you<br> to come downtown with me...<br> and we'll go to this charming little place<br> called Charlie's and we'll have a drink.<br> Oh, I'm sorry,<br> but we're on duty now.<br> Give us a rain check. Some<br> other time, we'd be glad to.<br> When? Well, I can't say offhand.<br> Miss Kelly and I are<br> on duty until 10:00 tonight.<br> for you. It's at Twelfth and Main.<br> If we can make it.<br> I'll be waiting.<br> The four of us will spend a<br> very pleasant evening together.<br> I want both of you to become friends<br> with a very dear friend of mine.<br> But you said later on,<br> didn't you? Yes, yes.<br> Later on it'll be.<br> Good-bye. Good-bye, Mr. Dowd.<br> Boy, that was<br> a close shave!<br> But he seemed like a<br> reasonable sort of a fellow.<br> You handled him beautifully,<br> Doctor. You were wonderful.<br> Psychology. Specialized<br> training. Takes years of it.<br> Good afternoon, Mrs. Chumley.<br> Good afternoon, Herman.<br> Oh, stop the car<br> a moment, Wesley.<br> Yoo-hoo!<br> Yoo-hoo!<br> Is there something I can do for<br> you? What did you have in mind?<br> You were walking on my husband's<br> prized dahlias. I'm Dr. Chumley's wife.<br> Oh, Dowd's my name. Elwood<br> P. Let me give you...<br> Looking for someone over<br> there? Yes. My friend Harvey.<br> I turned my back for an instant<br> and he seems to have wandered off.<br> I wish you could meet him,<br> Mrs. Chumley.<br> I'm sure he'd be quite taken<br> with you. Oh, thank you!<br> You're very nice to say so. Oh, not at all.<br> Mrs. Chumley, would you care to come downtown<br> with me? I'd be happy to buy you a drink.<br> Oh, I can't. My husband and I<br> are going to a cocktail party.<br> Dr. McClure is giving a party<br> for his sister from Wichita.<br> Oh! I didn't know Dr. McClure<br> had a sister in Wichita.<br> You know Dr. McClure?<br> No.<br> But you... But are you sure you wouldn't<br> have time to come with me and have a drink?<br> No, I can't. I'll tell<br> you what I'll do, however.<br> What will you do, however?<br> I'm interested.<br> If I meet your friend inside, I'll<br> be glad to give him a message for you.<br> Would you do that for me? I<br> certainly would appreciate that.<br> Just tell him to meet me<br> downtown if he has no other plans.<br> Any particular place<br> downtown? No, he knows where.<br> Harvey knows this town like a book.<br> How will I recognize your friend?<br> Oh, you can't miss him,<br> Mrs. Chumley. He's a "pooka."<br> A pooka?<br> Is that something new?<br> No, no. As I understand it,<br> that's something very old.<br> But Harvey's not only a pooka,<br> he's also my best friend.<br> Oh, if Harvey's said to me once, I'll<br> bet he's said probably a million times.<br> He said, "Mr. Dowd,<br> I would do anything for you."<br> How sweet.<br> Yeah. He's also very fond<br> of my sister Veta.<br> But Veta doesn't seem<br> to care for Harvey.<br> Don't you think that's rather<br> too bad, Mrs. Chumley?<br> I don't know. I gave up long ago<br> expecting my family to like my friends.<br> It's useless! We must<br> keep on trying, mustn't we?<br> Oh, yes.<br> Well, good-bye.<br> Good-bye.<br> Leslie, did he say<br> "pooka"?<br> Yes, ma'am.<br> That's what the man said.<br> Your pass? Oh! Yes, sir.<br> There you are.<br> Dowd.<br> Elwood P.<br> Isn't that interesting! Yes,<br> I constructed this myself.<br> Is that so? Well, I'll<br> declare! It's very simple. See?<br> Closed.<br> Opened.<br> You're a very brilliant man. Thank you.<br> My name is Herman Shimelplatzer,<br> but everybody calls me Herman.<br> You're to be congratulated,<br> Mr. Shimelplatzer. Thank you.<br> Would you care to come over to my<br> house for dinner tomorrow night?<br> I'm having a few friends in,<br> just informally.<br> I certainly would. That's<br> very nice of you, Mr. Dowd.<br> Let me give you one<br> of my cards.<br> If you should want to call me,<br> call me at this number.<br> Don't call me at that one.<br> That's the old one. Good-bye.<br> That's remarkable.<br> I hate to take you away, Willie, but we<br> did promise Dr. McClure we'd be there early.<br> One moment, angel. My hat and<br> coat, Miss Kelly. Yes, Dr. Chumley.<br> Dr. Sanderson. I'm leaving<br> for the day. Yes, Doctor?<br> About the difficulty of this woman with the<br> big white rabbit. Has it been smoothed over?<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> Good.<br> I've had many patients out here with<br> animals, but never an animal that large.<br> Yes, Doctor. She called him<br> Harvey. Unusual name for an animal.<br> I want her to have a hypo at<br> Willie... Yes, I'm<br> coming. My formula 9-7-7.<br> Listen, Willie...<br> Somebody's gonna have to give me a hand<br> with that Simmons dame. She's terrible!<br> I had to take her corset off<br> all by myself!<br> Hiya, Dr. Chumley.<br> How's every little...<br> Hey, what's with you and that hat? Hat?<br> Here's your hat.<br> I'm wearing my hat.<br> There was something... This<br> isn't my hat. Must be yours.<br> No, mine is... Of course it's not yours.<br> I'd like to say... No, dear,<br> of course it's not yours.<br> But whose hat is it?<br> He won't let me talk.<br> Look at this!<br> Two holes cut in the crown.<br> It's probably some new fad.<br> Perhaps Mr. Dowd left it here, sir. Dowd?<br> Yes, that's what I was... That's Mrs.<br> Simmons' brother. I gave him a pass.<br> I've been trying to tell you. I met a<br> gentleman at the gate. His name was Dowd.<br> He said he was looking for<br> a friend of his named Harvey.<br> Harvey?<br> Yes! Yes, Harvey.<br> Holy smoke! I left the water running<br> on that Simmons dame in a hydro tub!<br> Why are you looking at me like that,<br> Willie? He was a nice, polite man.<br> He said his friend was a<br> pooka. Whatever that is.<br> Gimme Upper West "R."<br> Where did he go, Mrs.<br> Chumley? He went downtown.<br> Dunphy, I left that<br> Simmons dame soakin' in 13.<br> Do me a favor.<br> Turn off thejuice.<br> So you gave him a pass!<br> Perhaps they neglected to tell you at<br> medical school that a rabbit has pointed ears!<br> Do you know what<br> you've done?<br> You've allowed a psychopathic case to<br> roam around with an overgrown white rabbit!<br> You've laid me open<br> to a lawsuit!<br> I shall have to do something<br> I haven't done for 15 years.<br> I'll have to go after this<br> man, Dowd, and bring him back!<br> But when I do, Dr. Sanderson, your connection<br> with this institution will have ended.<br> Wilson, get the car. You'll have<br> to go to the McClure's without me.<br> Take a cab. You two, get<br> that woman out of the tub!<br> Willie? I'm going to call my attorney.<br> Willie? I'm going to call my attorney.<br> Wilson, what's a pooka? What's a what?<br> A pooka.<br> A pooka?<br> You could search me,<br> Mrs. Chumley!<br> "P." "O."<br> Poo... Pooka!<br> Oh dear, I'm already late<br> for the McClure's.<br> I did promise them<br> I'd be on time.<br> P-O-O-K-A.<br> "Pooka.<br> From old Celtic mythology.<br> "A fairy spirit<br> in animal form.<br> "Always very large.<br> "The pooka appears<br> here and there,<br> "now and then,<br> "to this one and that one.<br> "A benign but<br> mischievous creature.<br> "Very fond of rumpots,<br> crackpots...<br> and 'How are you,<br> Mr. Wilson?"'<br> "How are you,<br> Mr. Wilson?"<br> Who in the encyclopedia<br> wants to know?<br> Wilson, let's go. Dr. Chumley,<br> the screwiest thing just hap...<br> I know, and believe me, heads<br> will roll. But I was looking...<br> Quick, downtown.<br> Step on it.<br> Oh. Where's your mother? Where is she?<br> She took Uncle Elwood out to the<br> sanitarium. I thought you knew.<br> She just called me on the phone<br> at the club. She's hysterical.<br> Where's your phone? In the library.<br> What was Mother hysterical about?<br> I don't know. I couldn't make<br> out what she was talking about.<br> She was carrying on something fierce.<br> Where's the number of that sanitarium?<br> I'll look it up. I don't know<br> what Mother had to carry on about.<br> All she had to do was have Uncle<br> Elwood locked up. Maybe that's it.<br> I feel bad about havin' Elwood<br> locked up. I always liked that boy.<br> He could've done anything, been anything,<br> made a place for himself in the community.<br> And all he did was get a<br> big rabbit. Yeah, I know.<br> He's had that rabbit in my office many<br> a time. I'm old, but I don't miss much.<br> What's the name of this place?<br> Chumley's what? Chumley's Rest.<br> Yeah, Elwood had everything.<br> Brains, personality and friends.<br> Men liked him. Women<br> liked him. I liked him!<br> Women liked him?<br> Uncle Elwood? Mother!<br> Myrtle!<br> Veta Louise!<br> What's wrong, girl? I thought<br> I'd never see either of you again.<br> Take hold of her. She looks like<br> she's going to faint. Not so fast.<br> Don't rush her. Ease her in.<br> Get me where I can sit down.<br> There you are. Get her some<br> tea. Let me sit down somewhere.<br> You want some tea? Oh,<br> no. I don't want any tea.<br> The minute their backs were turned,<br> I ran like a frightened rabbit.<br> Oh, I didn't mean to say that!<br> I don't know what I'm saying.<br> Just let me sit here. Let me get<br> my breath. Let her get her breath.<br> Let me get my breath and then let me get<br> upstairs to my own bed where I can let go.<br> Mother,<br> what happened?<br> I want you to sue them. They<br> put me in and let Elwood out.<br> What's this? As I was going to the<br> taxi cab to get Elwood's things,<br> this awful man stepped out, he<br> was a white slaver, I know he was.<br> He was wearing one of those white<br> suits. That's how they advertise.<br> What did he do? He grabbed hold of<br> me and took me in there, and he...<br> Oh!<br> Go on, Veta. Go on,<br> Mother. Was he a young man?<br> Myrtle Mae, perhaps you'd better<br> leave the room. Now? I should say not.<br> Go on, Mother.<br> What'd he do, Veta?<br> He took me upstairs<br> and tore my clothes off.<br> Did you hear that?<br> Go on, Mother.<br> And then he dumped me<br> down in a tub of water.<br> Oh, for heaven's sake! By<br> Godfrey, I'll sue them for this!<br> I always thought that what<br> you were showed in your face.<br> Don't you believe it, Judge,<br> Myrtle Mae.<br> That man grabbed hold of me as<br> though I was a woman of the streets.<br> But I fought. I always said that<br> if a man jumped at me, I'd fight.<br> Haven't I always said that,<br> Myrtle Mae?<br> She's always said that. That's<br> what Mother's always told me to do.<br> He hustled me into the sanitarium<br> and dumped me in that tub of water...<br> and treated me as though I was a... A what?<br> A crazy woman. But he<br> did that just for spite.<br> Well, I'll be swizzled!<br> Then one of those doctors...<br> came upstairs and asked me<br> a lot of questions.<br> All about sex urges<br> and all that filthy stuff.<br> That place ought to be<br> cleaned up, Judge.<br> You ought to get the authorities<br> to clean it up.<br> Don't you ever go out there.<br> You hear me, Myrtle Mae?<br> This stinks to high heaven.<br> By Godfrey, it stinks!<br> Is that all those doctors do in<br> places like that, think about sex?<br> I don't know. Because if it is, they<br> ought to be ashamed of themselves.<br> It's all<br> in their heads anyway.<br> Why don't they take long<br> walks in the fresh air?<br> Judge Gaffney walked everywhere<br> for years, didn't you, Judge?<br> Did you? I better take some notes on this.<br> You said one of the doctors<br> came up to talk to you?<br> Yes. Dr. Sanderson. But don't pay<br> any attention to anything he says.<br> He's a liar. Close-set<br> eyes. They're always liars.<br> Besides, I told him something in<br> strictest confidence and he blabbed it.<br> You can't trust anyone!<br> What did you tell him? What<br> difference does it make?<br> I don't want to think about it.<br> I don't want to talk about it.<br> Anything you told Dr. Sanderson,<br> you can tell us.<br> This is your daughter, and I'm<br> your lawyer. I know which is which.<br> I don't want to talk about<br> it. I want to sue them.<br> And I want to get upstairs<br> to my own bed.<br> I should never have tried<br> to do anything about Elwood.<br> Something protects him.<br> That awful pooka.<br> Where is Uncle Elwood? How<br> should I know? They let him go!<br> They're not interested<br> in men at places like that.<br> You ought to know that,<br> Myrtle Mae. Don't be so naive.<br> Mother, no matter who jumped at you, we still<br> have to find Uncle Elwood and lock him up.<br> The next time,<br> you take him, Judge.<br> Oh, wait 'til Elwood hears what they<br> did to me. He won't stand for it.<br> You've got to sue them.<br> Myrtle Mae, I hope that<br> never, as long as you live,<br> a man tears the clothes off you<br> and sets you down in a tub of water.<br> Oh, there he is now! He's<br> after me! Stay where you are!<br> Knock him down, Judge. Kick<br> him! Don't let him get me!<br> Veta, please. I want you to<br> confront this man with your charges.<br> I don't want no part of that wacky dame.<br> I'm looking for that other screwball.<br> He's gotta go back to<br> Chumley's Rest. Kick him, Judge!<br> Veta, did you hear that?<br> Where is he? Where is<br> this guy, Elwood P. Dowd?<br> That screwball<br> with a rabbit.<br> What's the matter, you goofy too?<br> You a member of this cockeyed family?<br> I'm Mrs. Simmons' daughter.<br> Uncle Elwood is my uncle.<br> Look, kid, I've been to four fires and<br> A bartender give me a tip he<br> was here. Came with a bundle.<br> Now, where is he? What'd you<br> do with him? You hidin' him?<br> No...<br> I'm not hiding him.<br> Hey, my name's Marvin<br> Wilson, honey. What's yours?<br> Myrtle Mae. And I'm not<br> afraid of you. Myrtle Mae, huh?<br> If we grab your uncle, you'll be comin'<br> to the sanitarium on visitin' days.<br> Really, I don't know.<br> If you do, I'll be there.<br> You will? If you don't see me right<br> away, stick around. I'll show up.<br> Won't you sit down?<br> I got no time, kid.<br> I gotta find that uncle of yours<br> and be on my way. Now, where is he?<br> Where'd you put him? I<br> didn't put him anywhere.<br> I want you to catch him just as<br> much as you want to catch him.<br> I can't even have any callers<br> when he's around.<br> You shouldn't have any trouble about<br> callers, honey. Thank you very much.<br> I'll tell you something, Myrt. Yeah?<br> You not only got a nice build,<br> but you got something else too.<br> Really? What?<br> You got the screwiest uncle that ever<br> stuck his puss inside our nuthouse.<br> Would you like<br> a cup of coffee?<br> I can't, kid. Dr. Chumley's<br> checking all the police stations.<br> I better catch up with him. You look<br> awfully hungry. How about a sandwich?<br> Yeah, but I don't want that crazy dame<br> on my neck. Don't worry about Mother.<br> She won't come down.<br> She's too frightened.<br> Would you like a ham and rye?<br> How about an egg and onion?<br> I'd love to make you one. The eggs<br> and onions are waiting in the kitchen.<br> Suppose we go in the kitchen.<br> You can relax and be yourself.<br> Do you like your work?<br> Oh, I do now, Myrtle!<br> Charlie's Place?<br> Oh, Mr. Cracker.<br> Mr. Cracker, this is<br> Elwood P. Dowd speaking.<br> Tell me,<br> have you seen Harvey?<br> Uh-huh. Well, don't worry. I'll find him.<br> Mr. Cracker, I'm entertaining some<br> friends there tonight at 10:00.<br> May I have<br> my regular booth?<br> Oh, fine. Thank you.<br> Good-bye.<br> Harvey!<br> Harvey?<br> Hello?<br> Come on. Don't you wanna come back<br> in the kitchen and get acquainted?<br> I thought I heard voices.<br> What kind of voices?<br> Come on, I wanna talk to you. It<br> sounded something like "Harvey."<br> Harvey? I'd better get goin'. You<br> haven't finished your egg and onion.<br> Business before pleasure, even<br> if it's a pleasure bein' with you.<br> You make a great egg and<br> onion. Don't you want more?<br> I'll see you tomorrow out at the<br> nuthouse. You didn't finish your sandwich.<br> Wilson! What happened to<br> you? He's not here, Doctor.<br> Then what are you doing<br> here? I was just having...<br> What are you eating? An<br> egg and onion sandwich.<br> How can you think of food at a time<br> like this? Get over to Union Station.<br> I'm told Dowd goes down there to<br> watch trains. All right, Doctor.<br> Why did you send him away? Some<br> people pick the best times...<br> to keep other people from becoming<br> acquainted. My, dear... Judge Gaffney!<br> Chumley, just the man<br> I want to see.<br> Mrs. Simmons has retained me to file<br> suit against you. I've been searching...<br> File suit? I'm on my way to the<br> office to draw up the necessary papers.<br> What happened this afternoon was an unfortunate<br> mistake, but I've dismissed my assistant...<br> We shall see what we shall<br> see. There must be some way...<br> You'll hear from me in the morning.<br> Good-bye. But surely, Judge...<br> This is<br> most unfortunate.<br> Most unfortunate.<br> Judge Gaffney?<br> Judge Gaffney, I want...<br> You're not Judge Gaffney.<br> You have much more hair<br> than he has.<br> Besides, I never forget<br> a face. I'm Dr. Chumley.<br> You're Mrs. Simmons. Yes, of course.<br> I'm glad to know you, Dr. Chumley.<br> Would you mind asking Judge<br> Gaffney to come back? Certainly.<br> I want to tell him to sue you for $<br> Mrs. Simmons,<br> can't we talk this matter over?<br> After what happened to me today in the<br> bathtub? I don't want to talk it over!<br> Then will you please<br> just listen?<br> I don't want to listen to you.<br> I'm suing you.<br> Please listen to me, I beg of<br> you. I'll listen, all right.<br> But I'm warning you, it<br> won't do you any good. Hello.<br> No, I am not listening to my radio.<br> I am listening to Dr. Chumley.<br> Mrs. Simmons, that picture<br> over the mantle?<br> That portrait of my mother happens<br> to be the pride of this house.<br> Who painted it? Some<br> man. I forget his name.<br> He was around for the sittings.<br> Then we paid him and he went away.<br> I suppose if you have the money, you<br> can persuade people to do anything.<br> You brought this up. You might<br> as well learn something quickly.<br> I took a course in art last winter.<br> I learned the difference between...<br> a fine oil painting and a<br> mechanical thing, like a photograph.<br> The photograph shows<br> only the reality.<br> The painting shows not only the<br> reality, but the dream behind it.<br> It's our dreams<br> that carry us on.<br> They separate us<br> from the beasts.<br> I wouldn't want to go on living if I<br> thought it was all just eating and sleeping.<br> And taking my clothes off.<br> I mean, putting them on.<br> Ooh, ooh!<br> Oh, Doctor!<br> Mrs. Simmons, steady now,<br> steady. Don't upset yourself.<br> Everything's going to be<br> all right. What's the matter?<br> Doctor, that is not<br> my mother!<br> I'm very glad<br> to hear that.<br> Elwood's been here. He's been here,<br> Doctor! Now, now, better be quiet.<br> I'll take it.<br> Hello? Yes?<br> Who's calling?<br> He's here! It's your<br> brother! Let me talk to him.<br> Be careful. Don't let him<br> know that I'm here. Be casual.<br> Yes, I'll be casual.<br> Yes.<br> Hello, Elwood.<br> Where are you, dear?<br> I'm here, Veta.<br> l-ls Harvey there?<br> He won't say where he is. He<br> wants to know if Harvey's here.<br> Tell him Harvey is here. But he isn't!<br> I know that, but pretend he<br> is. We've got to humor him.<br> Hello, Elwood.<br> Yes, dear, Harvey's here.<br> Why don't you come home?<br> It won't work. He wants us<br> to call Harvey to the telephone.<br> Well, say Harvey's here but he can't come<br> to the phone because he's in the bathtub.<br> Oh, Doctor! You've got<br> to do it, Mrs. Simmons.<br> Yes, dear, Harvey is here, but he can't<br> come to the telephone. He's in the bathtub.<br> I'll send him over as soon as<br> he's dry. Where are you, dear?<br> I-I-I'm...<br> Never mind. Harvey just<br> walked in the door down here.<br> Oh... Mr. Cracker,<br> two martinis.<br> Good-bye, Veta.<br> You'd better look in the<br> bathtub. It must be a stranger.<br> He says Harvey just walked through the<br> door. It must be a stranger in the bathtub.<br> But I know where he is.<br> He's at Charlie's Place.<br> That's a bar at 12th and Main.<br> That's two over and one down.<br> Where are you going? I'm going to<br> get your brother and bring him back,<br> take him to the sanitarium<br> where he belongs.<br> I want to observe the expression on<br> his face when he talks to this rabbit.<br> He does talk to the rabbit?<br> They tell each other everything.<br> What? Yes, he talks to<br> him, but don't go out there.<br> You'll regret it if you do.<br> Nonsense. You underestimate me<br> No, you underestimate my brother.<br> Don't worry. I can handle him.<br> You can handle him?<br> That's what you think.<br> Myrtle Mae, see who the<br> stranger is in the bathtub.<br> Sounds funny,<br> but I'll miss this place.<br> I guess I'll miss<br> a lot of things around here.<br> You will?<br> You won't laugh?<br> Of course not.<br> You know how it is working around people<br> day after day. You get attached to them.<br> I know, Lyman. It may be<br> ridiculous, but I'm gonna miss...<br> every one of the psychos and<br> neuros and schizos in the place.<br> I guess I'll even miss<br> Dr. Chumley.<br> In spite of the fact that he fired me,<br> I have a genuine admiration for him.<br> You can miss your psychos<br> and schizos, Dr. Sanderson!<br> You can miss whomever you<br> please. But after you leave here,<br> I won't miss a thing,<br> not a single, solitary thing!<br> Now what's wrong? Nothing. I<br> came down to say good-bye to you.<br> So good-bye, good luck<br> and good riddance!<br> You can't even say good-bye without<br> putting it on a personal basis.<br> Don't flatter yourself. There's<br> nothing personal about this.<br> I think you've been working too<br> hard. You're getting neurotic.<br> Don't start analyzing me. Save<br> your psychiatry for your next job!<br> I'm not using psychiatry. And let<br> me give you a little friendly advice.<br> That chip on your shoulder stems from a<br> persecution complex that goes back to childhood.<br> Thanks so much for<br> the case history, Doctor.<br> Could you tell me what an overinflated<br> ego stems from? Now, listen here!<br> Hiya, Kelly.<br> Hiya, Doc.<br> I'm glad I caught you<br> before you left.<br> I'm sorry you got bounced. We're<br> all gonna miss ya. Thanks, Wilson.<br> Any of the patients been acting<br> up? Everything's just peachy!<br> That's good. When are<br> you takin' off? Right now.<br> I was waiting<br> for Dr. Chumley to get back.<br> Wait a second. Didn't Dr. Chumley<br> come back with that pyscho?<br> We thought he was with you. No.<br> I left him with that Simmons dame.<br> When I called back later to check with him,<br> she told me the Doctor went to bring her bro...<br> That was four hours ago! Have<br> you any idea where he went?<br> Yeah. No!<br> Come on, come on.<br> I don't know. I can't think. Poor Dr. Chumley<br> may be layin' in an alley in a pool of blood.<br> Mr. Dowd seemed harmless<br> this afternoon.<br> I've been wrestling these guys for<br> years, and they're pretty tricky.<br> One minute they're sweet, and the<br> next minute... they give you the knife.<br> The name of the place? It was<br> a barroom and a guy's name.<br> Charlie! Charlie's Place.<br> That's a lead. We'll start there.<br> Never mind. I'll go with<br> Wilson. You needn't bother.<br> Until Dr. Chumley comes back,<br> I'm still in charge here!<br> Let's get goin'. Let's not<br> stand and argue about it.<br> Yeah,<br> this is the place.<br> What'll it be, folks? We're<br> looking for someone, two men.<br> A tall, short one and a thin, fat one. I'm<br> so nervous, I don't know what I'm sayin'.<br> One man is short and middle-aged.<br> The other is much taller and younger.<br> They might have been here about<br> four hours ago. No, can't say I have.<br> We've been running<br> medium sizes all evenin'.<br> The tall man was soft-spoken and<br> sort of polite. His name is Dowd.<br> Dowd? Why didn't you say so?<br> He's here now in the back booth.<br> Is he alone? Well, there's<br> two schools of thought, sir.<br> If that crackpot did anything to<br> Dr. Chumley, I'll knock his teeth...<br> No rough stuff. Psychology.<br> I'll do the talking.<br> Well, I've been expecting<br> you. Where's the Doctor?<br> Wilson! Why don't you<br> take a look around the place?<br> Why don't you do that? Although<br> I don't believe it's for sale.<br> Miss Kelly,<br> these are for you.<br> Why, thank you, Mr.<br> Dowd! A pleasure, my dear.<br> You know, after what happened this afternoon,<br> these flowers really should be from you.<br> Now, won't you join me? Mr.<br> Dowd, I'm afraid we can't do that.<br> The situation has changed since this<br> afternoon, but I urge you to have no resentment.<br> Dr. Chumley is your friend and he only<br> wants to help you. Isn't that nice!<br> I'd be glad to help him. We all must<br> face reality, Dowd, sooner or later.<br> Uh-huh. Well, I wrestled with<br> reality for 35 years, Doctor.<br> And I'm happy to state<br> I finally won out over it.<br> Mr. Dowd,<br> where is Dr. Chumley?<br> Not knowing, I cannot say. Wish I could.<br> Miss Kelly, I don't like to see<br> you standing. Sit down, Kelly.<br> There we are. Now, let's all have a drink.<br> Dr. Chumley did come in here<br> to get you earlier this evening?<br> Yes, he did. And I was<br> delighted to see him.<br> What'll it be, Mr. Dowd? Martinis?<br> - But that was four hours ago.<br> - Where has the evening gone?<br> Four... Three martinis, Mr. Cracker.<br> I've looked all over this joint. There's<br> no sign of the Doctor. What'd you do to him?<br> We're trying to find out.<br> What happened then?<br> I introduced Harvey to the<br> Doctor, and he sat down with us.<br> Harvey was sitting here,<br> and the Doctor sat opposite<br> Harvey so he could look at him.<br> Who's Harvey? A white<br> rabbit, six feet tall.<br> - Six feet?<br> - Six feet, three and a half inches. Let's stick to facts.<br> What happened after you<br> introduced Dr. Chumley to Harvey?<br> Harvey suggested that<br> I buy him a drink.<br> Knowing that he doesn't like to drink alone,<br> I suggested to Dr. Chumley we join him.<br> We joined him.<br> Go on.<br> Wejoined him again.<br> - Then what?<br> - Then the other matter came up.<br> Now we're gettin' somewhere.<br> What other matter?<br> Eh... Mr. Wilson, I don't<br> like to see you standing.<br> Wouldn't you join us here? Who, me?<br> Sit down, will you, Wilson? Sit right down.<br> You say this other matter<br> came up, Mr. Dowd.<br> Yes. There was a beautiful blonde<br> woman name of Mrs. Smethills...<br> and her escort seated in the<br> booth directly across from us.<br> Dr. Chumley went over to sit<br> next to her, explaining to her...<br> that they had once met...<br> in Chicago.<br> Then her escort<br> escorted Dr. Chumley...<br> back here<br> to Harvey and me,<br> and tried to point out that it<br> would be better for Dr. Chumley...<br> to mind<br> his own affairs.<br> Does he have any? Does he have any what?<br> Any affairs? How would I know? Shut up!<br> Go on, Mr. Dowd. Well...<br> Thank you, Mr. Cracker.<br> Mrs. Smethills' escort seemed to get more<br> depressed as he kept looking at Dr. Chumley.<br> So Harvey and I felt we should<br> take the Doctor somewhere else.<br> Harvey suggested<br> Blondie's Chicken Inn,<br> but the Doctor<br> wanted to go to Eddie's.<br> And while they were arguing about it, I<br> went up to the bar to order another drink.<br> When I came back here,<br> they were gone.<br> You don't believe that story about the<br> Doctor talking to a big white rabbit, do you?<br> Why not?<br> Harvey was here.<br> At first Dr. Chumley seemed<br> frightened of Harvey,<br> but that gave way to admiration<br> as the evening wore on.<br> "The evening wore on."<br> That's a very nice expression, isn't it?<br> With your permission,<br> I'll say it again.<br> "The evening wore on."<br> And with your permission<br> I'm gonna knock your brains out.<br> Look, you did something to Dr. Chumley,<br> and I'm gonna find out what it is.<br> Stop! Lyman! Wilson!<br> For heaven's sake!<br> Get outside!<br> Mr. Cracker?<br> Sure, Mr. Dowd. Mr. Cracker,<br> may I intercede for my friends?<br> Youth and high spirits. Time will<br> take care of that. Sure, Mr. Dowd.<br> Okay, boys,<br> let 'em go.<br> If Mr. Dowd vouches for you, okay. One more<br> peep out of you and I'll butter your necktie.<br> Yeah, fine. Get back to your dancing.<br> Stimulating as all this is, I<br> think we all should have our drinks.<br> Here, Miss Kelly,<br> sit down.<br> Here we are.<br> Dr. Sanderson.<br> You keep your eye on him. I'm gonna<br> check in those other two joints.<br> And Dr. Chumley better<br> be there, pal... or else!<br> Mr. Wilson?<br> Yeah?<br> Good-bye, Mr. Wilson. My regards to you<br> and anybody else you happen to run into.<br> Ah, you...<br> Mr. Dowd, can't you think of anything<br> else that might help us to find the Doctor?<br> Miss Kelly, may I<br> take hold of your hand?<br> Yes, Mr. Dowd,<br> if you want to.<br> We're all so worried.<br> Please try to think. Please?<br> For you I'd do anything. I'd almost<br> be willing to live my life over again.<br> Almost.<br> But I've told it all.<br> You're sure?<br> I'm quite sure.<br> But ask me again anyway,<br> won't you?<br> I liked that warm tone you<br> had in your voice just then.<br> So did I.<br> Maybe we better go someplace else.<br> Miss Kelly seems to be unhappy.<br> No, let's stay here.<br> Kelly's all right.<br> Perhaps you'd like<br> to dance, Miss Kelly.<br> All right, Mr. Dowd, if<br> you'd like to. Oh, not I! No.<br> I used to dance.<br> I haven't danced in years.<br> I'm sure Dr. Sanderson would love to<br> dance with somebody as lovely as you.<br> Hmm? Would you, Miss Kelly?<br> All right.<br> There we are.<br> It's been a long time<br> since we've danced together.<br> Yes, a long time.<br> I'd forgotten what<br> a wonderful dancer you were.<br> If we didn't have to humor Mr. Dowd,<br> you wouldn't have remembered at all.<br> I'm not dancing with you<br> to humor Mr. Dowd, Ruth.<br> We shouldn't<br> have left him alone!<br> Where are you goin',<br> Mr. Dowd?<br> I was just looking<br> for someone.<br> Why don't you come back inside?<br> All right, if you want me to.<br> It seemed to be so pleasant<br> out here.<br> You know, you two look<br> very nice dancing together.<br> I used to know<br> a whole lot of dances.<br> The Flea Hop.<br> And what's the...<br> The Black Bottom.<br> The Varsity Drag.<br> I don't know. I just don't<br> seem to have any time anymore.<br> I have so many things<br> to do.<br> What is it you do,<br> Mr. Dowd?<br> Harvey and I<br> sit in the bars...<br> and have a drink or two,<br> play the jukebox.<br> And soon the faces<br> of all the other people,<br> they turn toward mine<br> and they smile.<br> They're saying, "We don't know your name,<br> mister, but you're a very nice fellow."<br> Harvey and I...<br> warm ourselves<br> in all these golden moments.<br> We've entered as strangers.<br> Soon we have friends.<br> And they come over<br> and they sit with us,<br> they drink with us<br> they talk to us.<br> And they tell about the big,<br> terrible things they've done...<br> and the big, wonderful things<br> they'll do.<br> Their hopes<br> and their regrets,<br> and their loves and their<br> hates, all very large...<br> because nobody ever brings<br> anything small into a bar.<br> And then...<br> I introduce them<br> to Harvey.<br> And he's bigger and grander<br> than anything they offer me.<br> And...<br> and when they leave,<br> they leave impressed.<br> The same people<br> seldom come back,<br> but that's...<br> that's envy, my dear.<br> There's a little bit of envy<br> in the best of us.<br> And that's too bad,<br> isn't it?<br> How did you happen<br> to call him Harvey?<br> Well, Harvey's<br> his name.<br> How do you<br> know that?<br> There was a rather interesting<br> coincidence on that, Doctor.<br> One night several years ago I was walking<br> early in the evening along Fairfax Street.<br> It was between 18th and 19th.<br> Do you know the block?<br> Yes, yes.<br> I'd just put Ed Hickey<br> into a taxi.<br> Ed had been mixing his<br> rye with his gin, and he...<br> I just felt that<br> he needed conveying.<br> Anyway, I was walking along the<br> street and I heard this voice saying,<br> "Good evening, Mr. Dowd."<br> Well, I turned around...<br> and here was this big six-foot<br> rabbit leaning up against a lamppost.<br> I thought nothing of that because<br> when you've lived in a town...<br> as long as I've lived in this one, you get<br> used to the fact that everybody knows your name.<br> Naturally, I went over<br> to chat with him.<br> And he said to me,<br> he said,<br> "Ed Hickey was a little spiffed this<br> evening. Or could I be mistaken?"<br> Of course<br> he was not mistaken.<br> I think the world and all<br> of Ed, but he was spiffed.<br> We talked like that for a<br> while and then I said to him,<br> "You have the advantage<br> on me.<br> You know my name<br> and I don't know yours."<br> And right back at me<br> he said,<br> "What name do you like?"<br> Well, I didn't even have<br> to think twice about that.<br> Harvey's always been<br> my favorite name.<br> So I said to him,<br> I said, "Harvey."<br> And, uh...<br> Th-This is the interesting thing<br> about the whole thing.<br> He said,<br> "What a coincidence.<br> My name happens<br> to be Harvey."<br> Dowd,<br> what was<br> your father's name?<br> John.<br> John Stuyvesant.<br> Tell me, Dowd,<br> when you were a child,<br> didn't you have a playmate?<br> Someone with whom<br> you spent many happy hours?<br> Yes. Yes,<br> I did, Doctor.<br> Didn't you?<br> Yes.<br> What was his name?<br> Vern.<br> Vern McElhinney.<br> You ever know the McElhinneys, Doctor? No.<br> That's too bad. There were a<br> lot of them and they circulated.<br> Very nice people.<br> Just wonderful people.<br> Think carefully,<br> Dowd.<br> Didn't you know somebody sometime,<br> someplace by the name of Harvey?<br> Didn't you ever know anybody<br> by that name?<br> No. No,<br> not one, Doctor.<br> Maybe that's why I always<br> had such hopes for it.<br> We looked in both of those joints, and<br> Dr. Chumley ain't in either one of'em.<br> I brought help.<br> What're you doin' out here?<br> Come on. We're going back<br> to the sanitarium. Wh...<br> Come, Elwood. Very well, Lyman.<br> I'm afraid I won't be able to<br> stay very long. I must find Harvey.<br> Which one is Dowd? My<br> name's Dowd, Elwood P.<br> Here, let me give you one of<br> my cards. Never mind the card!<br> Wilson,<br> what did I tell you?<br> Coming, coming.<br> Who is it? It's me. Open the gates quickly.<br> Oh, it's you, Doctor!<br> I thought you'd gone for the<br> night. I thought you'd gone.<br> Close them, Herman.<br> Close the gates.<br> Are you all right,<br> Doctor? I'm being followed.<br> Who's following you? None of your business.<br> Ahh! Ahh!<br> You called me,<br> Doctor?<br> No. No, I didn't.<br> No.<br> Everything's fine.<br> What's wrong? What happened,<br> Herman? What's goin' on?<br> The alarm went off. Somebody<br> must've come through a window.<br> Yes, Doctor. Sanderson, he's after me.<br> Who's after you, Doctor?<br> I don't see anyone.<br> I saw him. He came through<br> the window. Who was it?<br> Who came through<br> the window, Doctor?<br> I won't tell you. What's he talkin' about?<br> Forget it.<br> I'm going to my office and<br> I don't wish to be disturbed.<br> Forget it, he says.<br> Not me.<br> I'm takin' a look around this<br> joint. I'm gonna see what's goin' on.<br> It's locked.<br> Locked?<br> Have you any<br> extra keys, Miss?<br> Yes, we have.<br> I'll get them.<br> Dr. Chumley, I went around the<br> house and climbed through the window.<br> I didn't see anybody. Thank you,<br> Wilson. It's quite all right.<br> Everything's in order,<br> thank you. I'll be all right.<br> Dr. Chumley,<br> if you need me, I'll...<br> Holy smoke! We forgot about that crackpot.<br> He's probably roamin' around loose.<br> Excuse me.<br> I got 'im, Doctor.<br> Let's go upstairs.<br> I wanna do your fingernails for<br> you. That's thoughtful of you.<br> Just a second. I'll take<br> him. Thank you, Doctor.<br> Oh, Miss Kelly.<br> Perhaps you'd like this flower. I<br> seem to have misplaced my buttonhole.<br> Thank you, Mr. Dowd. Okay, let's go.<br> One moment, please.<br> Ah, Dr. Chumley. How nice<br> to run into you again.<br> How are you getting along<br> with Harvey? Oh, well, uh...<br> Mr. Dowd, I'd like to speak to<br> you in my office alone, please.<br> I'd like that, too, but I just promised<br> this gentleman he could give me a manicure.<br> Of course, if you wouldn't mind waiting<br> a few minutes. Not at all, Mr. Dowd.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> You first. Go ahead. Oh...<br> Mr. Dowd, won't you have a seat? Thank you.<br> Will you have a cigar?<br> No, thank you, Doctor.<br> Is there anything<br> I can do for you?<br> What did you<br> have in mind?<br> Mr. Dowd, what kind<br> of a man are you?<br> Where do you<br> come from?<br> Why, didn't l... Didn't<br> I give you one of my cards?<br> And where on the face of this tired<br> old earth did you find a thing like him?<br> You mean, Harvey the Pooka? Yes, it's<br> true, the things you told me tonight.<br> I know it now.<br> Yes, yes.<br> Yes, Harvey has several<br> very interesting facets.<br> Did I tell you about Mrs. McElhinney? No.<br> She lives right next door<br> to us. Wonderful woman.<br> Harvey told me last night that<br> Mrs. McElhinney's Aunt Rose...<br> was going to drop in<br> on her unexpectedly...<br> this morning from Cleveland. And did she?<br> Did she what?<br> Aunt Rose. Did she come,<br> just as Harvey said she would?<br> Oh, yes, yes.<br> These things always work out just<br> the way Harvey says they will.<br> He's very,<br> very versatile.<br> Did I tell you<br> he could stop clocks?<br> To what purpose?<br> You've heard the expression,<br> "His face would stop a clock."<br> Well, Harvey<br> can look at your clock...<br> and stop it.<br> And you can go anywhere you<br> like with anyone you like...<br> and stay as long<br> as you like.<br> And when you get back, not<br> one minute will have ticked by.<br> You mean that he...<br> You see...<br> He can... Science has<br> overcome time and space.<br> Well, Harvey has overcome<br> not only time and space,<br> but any objections.<br> Flyspecks!<br> Flyspecks!<br> I've been spending my life<br> among flyspects...<br> while miracles have been leaning<br> on lampposts at 18th and Fairfax.<br> Tell me, Mr. Dowd,<br> will he do this for you?<br> Oh, he'd be willing<br> at any time.<br> But so far I haven't been able to<br> think of anyplace I'd rather be.<br> I always have a wonderful time<br> wherever I am, whomever I'm with.<br> I'm having a fine time<br> right here with you, Doctor.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, l...<br> I know where I'd go.<br> Where?<br> I'd go to Akron. Akron! Oh, yes.<br> There's a cottage camp<br> just outside Akron...<br> in a grove<br> of maple trees.<br> Green, cool, beautiful.<br> That's my favorite tree.<br> And I'd go there with a pretty woman. Oh.<br> A strange woman,<br> a quiet woman.<br> Oh, under a tree. I wouldn't<br> even want to know her name,<br> while I would be just...<br> Mr. Smith.<br> Then I would send out<br> for cold beer.<br> No whiskey, huh?<br> No.<br> Then I would<br> tell her things.<br> Things that I've never told<br> to anyone.<br> Things that are locked deep...<br> in here.<br> And as I talked<br> to her,<br> I would want her to hold out<br> her soft white hand and say,<br> "Poor thing.<br> You poor, poor thing."<br> How long would you want<br> this to go on, Doctor?<br> Two weeks.<br> Two weeks?<br> Wouldn't that get<br> a little monotonous,<br> just Akron, cold beer and<br> "poor, poor thing" for two weeks?<br> No!<br> It would be wonderful.<br> Well, I can't help feeling,<br> Doctor,<br> that you're making a mistake<br> not allowing the woman to talk.<br> If she'd been around at all, she might've<br> picked up some interesting news items.<br> And I'm sure you're making a mistake<br> about all that beer and no whiskey,<br> but it's<br> your two weeks.<br> Mr. Dowd, could he...<br> Would he do this for me?<br> Oh, he could<br> and might.<br> I've never heard Harvey<br> say a word against Akron.<br> By the way, Doctor,<br> where is Harvey?<br> Don't you know?<br> The last time I saw him<br> he was with you.<br> He's probably waiting for me<br> down at Charlie's.<br> Yes, that's it. He's<br> down at Charlie's. Uh-huh.<br> In that case, I'll go down<br> and join him for a nightcap.<br> Fortunately, Charlie's<br> stays open rather late.<br> Excuse me, Doctor. I want to say good-bye<br> to some of my friends before I leave.<br> Mr. Dowd, none of those people<br> are your friends.<br> But I want you to know that I am<br> your friend. Thank you. And I'm yours.<br> They underestimate you,<br> as I did.<br> This sister of yours is at the<br> bottom of a conspiracy against you.<br> She's trying to persuade me to lock you up.<br> Today she had commitment papers drawn up.<br> She has your power of attorney<br> and the key to your safety box.<br> And she brought<br> you here!<br> My sister did all that in one afternoon?<br> That Veta certainly is a whirlwind, isn't she?<br> Good heavens, man! Haven't<br> you any righteous indignation?<br> Oh, Doctor, l...<br> Years ago my mother used<br> to say to me, she'd say,<br> "In this world, Elwood,<br> you must be..."<br> She always<br> called me Elwood.<br> "In this world, Elwood,<br> you must be oh, so smart...<br> or oh, so pleasant."<br> Well, for years<br> I was smart.<br> I recommend pleasant.<br> And you may quote me.<br> This is it.<br> Here we are.<br> Okay, thank you.<br> Come on, Myrtle.<br> I'll come... You wait<br> right here, Veta girl.<br> I will not wait here.<br> I'm going in with you.<br> You're a very high-strung girl.<br> This may be an ordeal.<br> Then let Myrtle Mae<br> stay here too.<br> Mother, you know it isn't right to put Uncle<br> Elwood away without some blood relative present.<br> Hey, you're not gonna leave<br> the lady here. I thought...<br> See, Omar? Even strangers<br> think I should go in with you.<br> I wish to see<br> Dr. Chumley.<br> I'm sorry, sir. He's in<br> conference. You'll have to wait.<br> After dragging me out of bed at this<br> hour? Tell him Judge Omar Gaffney's here.<br> I telephoned you right after we<br> picked up Mr. Dowd. I'm Dr. Sanderson.<br> I demand that this matter<br> be settled right now!<br> Oh, good, nobody here<br> but people.<br> You promised to wait in the car.<br> You forgot Elwood's bathrobe.<br> Why are you all standing<br> around? I thought you'd be...<br> How do you do, Doctor? Committing<br> Elwood. Hello, Mrs. Simmons.<br> He's the one<br> I told you about.<br> Girl. Doctor,<br> what's your opinion?<br> How are you feeling, Mrs.<br> Simmons? Better, thank you.<br> In my opinion, Elwood P. Dowd is suffering<br> from a third-degree hallucination.<br> I recommend formula<br> number 9-7-7.<br> That's a powerful serum which<br> will shock him back to reality.<br> Nothing will do that.<br> Lock him up.<br> If this shock formula brings people back<br> to reality, that's where we want Elwood.<br> Yes. If he won't see the<br> rabbit anymore, give it to him.<br> Then when Harvey comes<br> to the door, I'll deal with him.<br> Please stop talking about Harvey<br> as if there were such a thing!<br> Myrtle Mae, you have a lot to<br> learn, and I hope you never learn it.<br> Oh, Mother... Marvin! Myrtle Mae, baby!<br> Myrtle Mae, come back here.<br> The idea of that terrible man...<br> Let's get on with this, Doctor. I'm sorry, but<br> you'll have to take that up with Dr. Chumley.<br> Then why waste my time?<br> Young lady,<br> will you inform Dr. Chumley<br> of my presence or must I do it?<br> I'll attend to it<br> immediately, sir.<br> Oh.<br> Oh, Miss Kelly.<br> Isn't Dr. Chumley there?<br> How nice to see you.<br> Where's the Doctor?<br> What'd you...<br> Are you all right, Doctor? Yes,<br> thanks. I'm quite all right.<br> Well, Veta and Myrtle Mae!<br> What a delightful surprise.<br> Good evening, Elwood. I brought<br> your bathrobe. Thank you, Veta.<br> Well, Dr. Chumley, are we gonna<br> settle this matter or are we not?<br> I, uh... I've turned<br> this case over...<br> to Dr. Sanderson. Oh, no. You forget<br> I don't work here anymore, Dr. Chumley.<br> Dr. Sanderson, please disregard<br> what I said this afternoon.<br> I want you to head my staff. I think<br> you're a very capable young man.<br> Oh, Lyman,<br> did you hear that?<br> Now, if you'll excuse me,<br> I have some work to do.<br> Well, I think this calls<br> for a celebration.<br> Why don't we all go down to<br> Charlie's Place and have a drink?<br> You're not going anywhere,<br> Elwood. You're staying right there.<br> Yes, Uncle Elwood.<br> Stay here, son.<br> I plan to leave,<br> you want me to stay.<br> An element of conflict in any<br> discussion is a very good thing.<br> Shows everybody's taking part,<br> and nobody left out. I like that.<br> Ah, Miss Kelly.<br> Miss Kelly, you know,<br> when you wear my flower...<br> you make it beautiful.<br> "A diviner grace has never<br> brightened this enchanting face."<br> Ovid's Fifth Elegy. Ovid's<br> always been my favorite poet.<br> My dear,<br> you'll never look lovelier.<br> I'll never be happier,<br> Mr. Dowd. I know it.<br> Hey, this rabbit gag<br> must be a good one.<br> Mr. Dowd, I have a formula, 9-7-7, that<br> will be good for you. Will you take it?<br> It's a serum.<br> Oh. You won't see this rabbit anymore.<br> But you will see your responsibilities<br> and your duties. Uh-huh.<br> Well, Doctor,<br> if you thought of this,<br> I'm sure it must be<br> a very fine thing.<br> And if I happen to run into anybody who<br> needs it, I'd be glad to recommend it.<br> But as for myself, I don't<br> think I'd care for it.<br> You hear that, Judge?<br> You hear that, Doctor?<br> That's what we put up with.<br> Veta, do you want me to take this?<br> Oh, Elwood, I'm only<br> thinking of you.<br> You're my brother and I've known you<br> for years. I'd do anything for you.<br> Harvey wouldn't do anything for<br> you. He's making a fool of you.<br> Elwood, don't be a fool. I won't.<br> Why, you could amount<br> to something.<br> You could be sitting on the Western<br> Slope Water Board right now...<br> if you'd only go over<br> and ask them.<br> If that's what you want, Harvey and<br> I'll go over tomorrow and ask them.<br> Tomorrow! I wish there might<br> never be another tomorrow!<br> Not if Myrtle Mae and I have to<br> go on living with that rabbit!<br> Our friends never come to see us<br> anymore. We have no social life whatever!<br> We've no life<br> at all.<br> We're both<br> perfectly miserable.<br> But perhaps you don't<br> care. All right, now, Veta.<br> Well, l...<br> I've always felt Veta should<br> have everything she wants, but...<br> Veta,<br> are you sure?<br> Yes.<br> I-I'll take it. Where do I go,<br> Doctor? In my office, Mr. Dowd.<br> This will only take a few<br> minutes. Why don't you wait?<br> Veta, you tell Dr. Chumley to say good-bye<br> to the old fellow for me, will you?<br> Dr. Sanderson,<br> couldn't we...<br> Yes, Kelly?<br> Nothing.<br> I'll need you<br> to give me a hand, Miss Kelly.<br> Right in here. No, no. After you.<br> No, after you.<br> Miss Kelly. No, after you. Here we go.<br> Dr. Sanderson said<br> it wouldn't take long.<br> Ooh, ooh!<br> Sit down, girl. Thank you, Judge.<br> He said it wouldn't take...<br> long.<br> Relax, girl.<br> Take it easy.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll try to, but...<br> Oh, there you are. Lady jumped out<br> of my cab, left without payin' me.<br> She didn't say anything, and a<br> fellow gets nervous after a while.<br> Well, there's no cause for<br> concern, man. How much is it?<br> All the way out there<br> from town? $2.75.<br> Why, I must've forgotten<br> my wallet.<br> I was dragged out of bed in such a hurry,<br> it's a wonder I didn't forget my pants.<br> Beg your pardon,<br> Veta.<br> Uh, would you take a<br> check? We don't take checks.<br> Yeah, I know, but...<br> Would you mind, Veta?<br> Oh, of course.<br> Yes, I, uh...<br> Well, I could've sworn<br> I brought my coin purse.<br> Where is it?<br> Oh, the idea!<br> Well, I never!<br> Oh, I know. I'll get it<br> for you from my brother.<br> But I can't go in just now. He's<br> in there getting an injection.<br> It won't take long.<br> You'll have to wait.<br> You're gonna get my money from<br> your brother who's in there...<br> getting some of that stuff<br> they shoot out here?<br> Yes. It'll only take<br> a few minutes.<br> Lady, I want my money now. I told<br> you it'll only take a few minutes.<br> We want you to drive us<br> back to town.<br> I told you I want my money now or I'm nosin'<br> the cab back to town and you can wait for a bus.<br> Well, of all the pigheaded,<br> stubborn things!<br> What's the matter with you?<br> Nothing that $2.75 won't fix.<br> You heard me.<br> Take it or leave it.<br> I never heard of anything so<br> unreasonable in all my life.<br> Would you please let my<br> brother step out here a moment?<br> This cab driver won't wait.<br> Oh, Elwood.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Elwood, I came off<br> without my coin purse.<br> Would you please give<br> this man $2.75?<br> But don't give him any more.<br> He's been very rude.<br> Howdy do. Dowd's my name, Elwood P.<br> Mine's Lofgren, E.J. Glad<br> to know you, Mr. Lofgren.<br> This is my sister Mrs. Simmons. My<br> good friend Judge Gaffney, back there.<br> Hi. Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Have you lived around<br> here long? All my life.<br> Enjoy your work?<br> It's okay.<br> I've been driving<br> for Apex Cabs for 15 years.<br> My brother Joe's been driving<br> for Brown Cabs for near 12.<br> Is that so? You drive for Apex<br> and your brother Joe for Brown.<br> That's interesting, isn't it, Veta? Yes.<br> Mr. Lofgren, let me give you<br> one of my cards.<br> My sister and my charming niece<br> live at that address with me.<br> Wouldn't you and your brother like to<br> come and have dinner with us sometime?<br> Sure,<br> be glad to.<br> When? When would you<br> be glad to?<br> I couldn't come any night but tomorrow.<br> I'm on duty all the rest of the week.<br> Tomorrow would be perfect. We'll be<br> expecting you and delighted to see you.<br> Won't we, Veta? Elwood, I'm sure<br> this man has friends of his own.<br> Can't have<br> too many friends.<br> Don't keep the Doctor waiting.<br> It's rude.<br> There you are. Keep the change. I'm<br> glad to have met you, Mr. Lofgren.<br> I'll expect you and your brother tomorrow<br> night. Now, you'll have to excuse me. l...<br> A sweet guy.<br> Certainly.<br> You could just as well have waited. Ah, no.<br> Lady, I've been drivin'<br> this route for 15 years.<br> I've brought 'em out here to get that stuff,<br> and I've drove 'em home after they had it.<br> It changes them.<br> I certainly hope so.<br> You ain't kiddin'.<br> On the way out here,<br> they sit back and enjoy<br> the ride, they talk to me.<br> Sometimes we stop and watch the<br> sunsets and look at the birds.<br> Sometimes we stop and watch the<br> birds when there ain't no birds,<br> and look at the sunsets<br> when it's rainin'.<br> We have a swell time.<br> And I always get a big tip.<br> But afterwards...<br> ooh-ooh.<br> "Afterwards, ooh-ooh." What do<br> you mean, "Afterwards, ooh-ooh"?<br> They crab, crab, crab.<br> They yell at me,<br> "Watch the lights! Watch the<br> breaks! Watch the intersections!"<br> They scream at me to hurry. They<br> got no faith in me and my buggy.<br> Yet, it's the same cab, same driver, and<br> we're going back over the very same road.<br> It's no fun.<br> And, no tips.<br> My brother would've tipped<br> you anyway. He's very generous.<br> He always has been. Not<br> after this he won't be.<br> After this he'll be<br> a perfectly normal human being.<br> And you know what stinkers<br> they are.<br> Glad I met ya.<br> I'll wait.<br> Oh, no! No!<br> Elwood, come out.<br> Don't give it to him! Stop<br> it! Stop it! Elwood, come out.<br> Don't do that, girl. Dr.<br> Sanderson's giving the injection.<br> I don't want him to have it.<br> I don't like people like that.<br> I don't want my brother<br> to be like that. Elwood!<br> Oh, you haven't given him the<br> injection already, have you?<br> No, but we're all ready,<br> Mrs. Simmons. Oh, Elwood!<br> What's the trouble?<br> What's goin' on?<br> What's wrong?<br> She wants to stop the<br> injection. She does, huh?<br> Come on, you. Take your hands off me!<br> Don't you touch me,<br> you white slaver, you!<br> Marvin, please! All right,<br> honey. Anything you say.<br> You don't know what you want. You<br> didn't want that rabbit either.<br> What's wrong with Harvey?<br> If Elwood and Myrtle Mae and I want<br> to live with Harvey, what is it to you?<br> You don't even have to<br> come around. It's our house.<br> Elwood! Oh, Elwood. Veta, that's all right.<br> Veta's all tired out.<br> She's done a lot today.<br> Have it your own way, but I'm<br> gonna take that cab back to town.<br> I'm not giving up another night's sleep<br> again no matter how big the animal is!<br> Elwood,<br> let us go too.<br> I hate this place.<br> I wish I'd never seen it.<br> All right, Veta. Wait<br> 'til I get my hat and coat.<br> Why...<br> Why look at that!<br> It's my coin purse.<br> It must've been in there<br> all the time.<br> I could've paid<br> that cab driver myself.<br> Harvey!<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> Ooh!<br> Myrtle Mae and that man!<br> They make a beautiful couple,<br> don't they?<br> Mr. Wilson has such a dynamic<br> personality. That man...<br> Myrtle Mae...<br> Mr. Wilson, may we have...<br> the pleasure of your company<br> tomorrow night for dinner?<br> We're having a few friends in.<br> Very informal.<br> Certainly, Mr. Dowd. I'd<br> be glad to.
