                        All right. You take the inside.<br> On this one,<br> you take the inside. 54...<br> Ready, set...<br> Back! Throw! Throw the ball!<br> Touchdown, Joe.<br> - What?<br> - Pendleton. He's looking awful good.<br> Fall into it.<br> All right. Come on, baby.<br> Set... Good movement.<br> Let's try it again.<br> - He's looking awful good.<br> - Here we go!<br> Hustle back, hustle back.<br> Come on, guys. Come on.<br> Opposite left, play past 35.<br> X-curl on 1. Ready? Break.<br> - Play past 29...<br> - 2-81!<br> Pass! Pass! Pass!<br> Ball! Ball! Ball!<br> Once again, we had a foul-up<br> on that scrimmage.<br> The fullback has been<br> slow getting up for his block.<br> The guard almost ran into him.<br> We got to do it till it's right.<br> Formation left.<br> Screen right on 2. Ready?<br> Right, left! Right, left!<br> Looking awful good.<br> I'm thinking of starting him<br> on Sunday.<br> - What about Jarrett?<br> - Pendletors looking better.<br> Pass! Pass! Pass!<br> Ball! Ball! Ball!<br> - Is he still on cortisone?<br> - No.<br> Any kind of painkiller?<br> - Nothing.<br> - He's looking awful good.<br> I never saw a knee like that<br> heal without surgery.<br> - He's looking awful good.<br> - Looking good.<br> - Hi, Joe. How's the knee?<br> - Good.<br> What do you think<br> of the Rams' chances?<br> We're going to the Super Bowl to win.<br> - No, off the record.<br> - Off the record?<br> We're going to the Super Bowl to win.<br> - Sure. What about your competition?<br> - Competition?<br> - Jarrett.<br> - My competitiors 25 other teams.<br> - Max?<br> - Yeah!<br> - How you doing?<br> - What's in this brown stuff?<br> - That's mainly whipped liver.<br> - Liver?<br> I put a little whey in it, then mix it<br> with a little alfalfa sprouts,<br> and some bean curd and spinach.<br> It's nice, isn't it?<br> It's a liver and whey shake.<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday, dear Joe<br> Happy birthday to you<br> I didn't think anybody knew.<br> Thanks for coming, Max.<br> - Put it here.<br> - I hope you have a lot more.<br> What's this?<br> You know something? At my age,<br> in any other business, I'd be young.<br> Look at it this way...<br> Soon you can get into another<br> business and have a real life.<br> I don't know what that means.<br> This is the only business I know<br> that's real. I'm stuck.<br> What do you mean, stuck?<br> I've been working my whole life<br> to get a chance to do something...<br> I don't know if I'm ever going<br> to get a chance to do it.<br> - No, it's all right.<br> - I'll fix your neck.<br> - Don't do that, Joe.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - How's that?<br> - Oh, boy. Yeah.<br> It scares the hell out of me<br> every time you do that.<br> If you don't watch how your trapezius<br> goes into your deltoids,<br> you're going to throw off your entire<br> cervical and your lumbar areas.<br> Since I'm the only guy<br> knows how to fix that,<br> - you should listen to me.<br> - Maybe you should trade places.<br> You be the trainer.<br> I'll start on Sunday.<br> Yeah... what?<br> - I'm starting against Dallas?<br> - Yeah.<br> They don't want Jarrett.<br> They want you.<br> Happy birthday, Joe.<br> My watch stopped.<br> It keeps flashing the same time.<br> I'm dreaming, huh?<br> This is an aeroplane dream.<br> I forget what they mean.<br> I think they're a good sign.<br> Mr Pendleton.<br> Mr Pendleton, you must wait for me.<br> I'm your escort.<br> Wait for me, please, Mr Pendleton.<br> The end of the line,<br> Mr Pendleton, please.<br> Hi. How you doing?<br> You want to hear a little music?<br> - You have to wait in line.<br> - What? This is my dream, isn't it?<br> You mustrt get out of line. Really!<br> - Chamberlain, Paul R.<br> - All right.<br> I've brought the final passenger.<br> This manifest is complete.<br> - Hi.<br> - You cannot board before your turn.<br> I don't need a turn.<br> I'm not boarding.<br> You don't understand.<br> This is not your ultimate destination.<br> That will take you to it.<br> I'm not going. I'm going to run<br> around till I wake up.<br> I'm afraid I haven't fully explained<br> how this system is organised.<br> The rules derive from yours,<br> a product of your image and that<br> of those who share your image.<br> If you violate the rules, the principles...<br> You want to see a trick?<br> I do this to keep<br> my abductor pollicis limber.<br> I don't have a lot of patter with it.<br> Feel that. That's a 50-cent piece.<br> I just throw that<br> into that hand, you see.<br> I say the magic words, "Abracadabra",<br> and then presto, it's gone.<br> Now, you probably think<br> I still have it.<br> You're wrong, 'cause I can see it<br> coming out of your ear.<br> The only trick I know.<br> - Mr Pendleton!<br> - Gentlemen?<br> Gentlemen, what's the delay?<br> We've received a new arrival<br> who refuses to board.<br> That's impossible. Have you<br> explained the rules to him?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Quite clearly?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - And what was his rebuttal?<br> He took a coin out of my ear.<br> Did he? Perhaps I should<br> have a word with him.<br> Yes, sir. Mr Pendleton!<br> He's right over there, sir.<br> - Mr Pendleton!<br> - Yeah. You can call me Joe.<br> How you doing?<br> Mr Pendleton,<br> do you know where you are?<br> I'm in the middle<br> of a really weird dream.<br> - You see the problem?<br> - Joe, come here.<br> Look at me and listen carefully<br> to what I'm saying.<br> - This is not a dream.<br> - Yeah.<br> Life has a certain quality<br> all its own, a certain feeling.<br> So do dreams.<br> You know that this is not life.<br> And you know now<br> that this is not a dream.<br> This is a place that comes<br> after life and after dreams.<br> I'm sure you're aware of that, and<br> you'll take your place with the others.<br> Are you telling me...?<br> - I'm not supposed to be here.<br> - But you are here.<br> You guys made a mistake.<br> This is insupportable.<br> You're talking to Mr Jordan.<br> - Anybody can make a mistake.<br> - Mr Jordan, we're due to take off.<br> I have the situation in hand.<br> Joe, if you don't take your place,<br> the others can't complete<br> their journey. Is that fair?<br> I'm not supposed to be fair, you are.<br> I didn't make any mistake.<br> This is not heaven,<br> it's a way station. There's no mistake.<br> I want a check-out<br> on Joseph Pendleton.<br> When is he due at this way station?<br> Sir, I don't understand.<br> A check-out? Why?<br> The likelihood<br> of one individual being right<br> increases in proportion to how much<br> others try to prove him wrong.<br> Pendleton, Joseph. Due to arrive<br> Sir, I really can't believe it.<br> I took him out...<br> just before the accident.<br> You did what?!<br> You're not supposed to do that,<br> you must wait for the outcome.<br> But I was so sure, and it looked<br> like it would be painful.<br> - Wait. Are you saying...?<br> - Is this your first assignment?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Havert you learned the rules?<br> Every question of life and death<br> is a probability until the outcome.<br> So he jumped the gun.<br> Just put me back<br> and we'll forget the whole thing.<br> This man must be put back<br> into his body at once.<br> Thanks, Mr Jordan.<br> I'll see you in about 50 years.<br> - Max, I'm back.<br> - He can't hear you, Mr Pendleton.<br> I hope they got the best football<br> team in America in heaven,<br> and I hope God makes you<br> first-string.<br> I'm going to get my body back.<br> Where's my body?<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Cremated. I see.<br> I'm starting against Dallas<br> on Sunday.<br> The body you occupied<br> on Earth has been cremated.<br> Uncremate me! You must be able<br> to do something right.<br> Do the words "not being a good sport"<br> mean anything to you?<br> We can put you<br> into another mars body,<br> provided his death<br> has not yet been discovered.<br> Are you kidding? Put me<br> into the body of another man?<br> I just got my body back in shape.<br> The only way you can return<br> to life is in the body of another man.<br> I shall have to take charge<br> of this case personally.<br> Incredibly graceful. He's about<br> your age and in perfect condition.<br> He's too short.<br> He'd never see over the line.<br> You know what kind of shape you gotta<br> be in to get to the Super Bowl?<br> Yes, Joe. I understand.<br> - He's not talking English.<br> - I told you he was German.<br> - Hey, you talk any English?<br> - We can't be seen or heard, Joe.<br> Well, I don't want to talk German.<br> I gotta call the plays in English.<br> Joe, if you could not so much lower<br> but broaden your standards.<br> We've seen many bodies<br> and the choices are becoming limited.<br> - Julia, I beg of you...<br> - I want a drink.<br> - Dearest, please!<br> - I've got to have a drink.<br> Mr Farnswon'th loathes<br> cold cucumber soup.<br> Hey, this is some house.<br> Who lives here?<br> Leo Farnswon'th,<br> a man of enormous power.<br> Thank you, Sisk.<br> Just leave the door open<br> as you leave, Sisk. Thank you.<br> The more servants who see us,<br> the better.<br> - This guy? You're kidding!<br> - That's not Farnswon'th.<br> Give me a drink.<br> - Who are they?<br> - Farnswon'th's wife and secretary.<br> - You hate me.<br> - Don't be ridiculous. I love you.<br> I want a drink now! Tony...<br> It would be better<br> if you didn't drink.<br> How long will it be<br> before they find him?<br> I don't know, darling. Not long.<br> - I'm glad we did it.<br> - We couldn't help it.<br> It would be better if you'd try<br> not to unravel now. Thank you, Julia.<br> - Is Farnswon'th dead yet?<br> - Not yet.<br> What's the matter with him?<br> He can't keep his eyes open.<br> He's been drugged by those two<br> downstairs. This is a murder.<br> You see how he's slowly<br> sliding into the water?<br> Hey, somebody, get...!<br> Hey, get a doctor. There's a guy...<br> Get a doctor. You got a guy<br> drowning in the bathtub.<br> - You left a pot on the carpet.<br> - I can't hold everything at once.<br> Mrs Farnswon'th would kill you<br> if she saw that.<br> Hey, somebody! You got...<br> - Give me a drink!<br> - Please don't go overboard, dear.<br> He was a lecherous sadist.<br> Everyone wanted him dead.<br> - I should be canonised!<br> - Perhaps one drink.<br> - Where can the man be?<br> - I'm sorry, Miss Logan...<br> What harm can that do him?<br> - That's enough.<br> - He deserves to be dead.<br> They didn't? No kidding?<br> They're murderers.<br> What's going on?<br> I'm sorry, sir. It's Miss Logan<br> to see Mr Farnswon'th.<br> - Show her in.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It's the perfect alibi.<br> She insists on seeing him.<br> - Let's find another body.<br> - A servant will find him.<br> Excuse yourself and keep Sisk<br> with you at all times...<br> - Let's get out of here.<br> - Miss Logan, sir.<br> Miss Logan. I'm Tony Abbott.<br> This is the library.<br> That's Mrs Farnswon'th.<br> Hello. I'm going<br> into the living room.<br> - Want to come, Sisk?<br> - Certainly, madam.<br> I'm Mr Farnswon'th's personal<br> and private executive secretary.<br> I didn't know whether you knew that.<br> I'm sorry he's not down yet.<br> That's all right. I'll wait.<br> - Would you take a seat?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Perhaps you'd like<br> to tell me what it's about.<br> Mr Farnswon'th has been sent<br> hundreds of letters<br> from Pagglesham in England.<br> The people who live there,<br> are to be evicted from their homes<br> to make way for the proposed<br> Exo-Grey refinery.<br> Hundreds of families<br> will be forced to find other homes.<br> The few who remain<br> will have their health endangered<br> by poisoning of their air and water,<br> the evidence for which I have here,<br> along with a petition signed<br> by the 1,673 citizens of that area.<br> This is what I'm here about.<br> Mr Farnswon'th conducts business<br> at his office.<br> I've been to his office.<br> He refused to see me.<br> - I doubt he'd see you here.<br> - He'll have to, I'm not leaving.<br> - I'm sorry?<br> - I'm not leaving.<br> I've come 8,000 miles to do something<br> about a terrible injustice<br> that this man has perpetrated<br> on hundreds of defenceless people.<br> - Somebody ought to help her.<br> - You can. You can be Farnswon'th.<br> If Mr Farnswon'th doesn't see me,<br> I don't know what I'll do.<br> - Is that a threat?<br> - Yes.<br> I'd like to help,<br> but not as Farnswon'th.<br> - The decision is yours.<br> - You give me no choice. Sisk!<br> If I had to be Farnswon'th,<br> could we do it temporary?<br> Yes. We could arrange that<br> if you wish it.<br> Sisk, please tell Mr Farnswon'th<br> Miss Logan refuses to leave.<br> Yes, sir.<br> If you really want to help her,<br> you'd better hurry.<br> - Well, it's only temporary, right?<br> - That's correct.<br> Only Farnswon'th can help her.<br> Once the body's discovered,<br> it'll be too late.<br> That's me. I haven't changed.<br> - It's just me.<br> - Mr Farnswon'th?<br> - Now what do we do?<br> - Are you there, sir?<br> I'll never get away with this.<br> What will we do now?<br> Are you all right?<br> - Answer him.<br> - People can hear me now?<br> - Of course.<br> - But he knows the other guy's voice.<br> Mr Farnswon'th,<br> is everything all right?<br> Answer him.<br> Will you take it easy?<br> I'll be out in a minute.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> - It works.<br> Of course. You haven't changed.<br> You're still Joe Pendleton.<br> That's what you and I see.<br> But outwardly, you're Leo Farnswon'th,<br> and that's what everyone else sees.<br> Miss Logan is downstairs, sir.<br> She insists on seeing you.<br> Will you dress?<br> - Sure, sure.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> You mean I sound like this guy,<br> no matter what I talk like?<br> - I beg your pardon, Mr Farnswon'th?<br> - You see?<br> Julia, please, dear.<br> - Please, dear, not now. Not now.<br> - I want a sip.<br> You're sorry you have me, aren't you?<br> You wish he were alive.<br> - Julia, please.<br> - Why don't you say it's not true?<br> - You didn't say it's not true.<br> - It's not true.<br> Say it again.<br> Darling, it's not true.<br> I don't hate you. I love you.<br> - There, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Your helmet, sir.<br> Your polo helmet, sir.<br> - Thanks. Do I play polo?<br> - Not really, sir.<br> - Sir?<br> - Thank you.<br> - This Logan girl is a godsend.<br> - What's taking so long?<br> Pretend you're reading.<br> - Miss Logan, sir.<br> - Hi. How you doing?<br> I'm not leaving until you've heard<br> what I have to say.<br> Oh, yeah. Well, good.<br> Mr Farnswon'th, you've been sent<br> hundreds of letters from Pagglesham.<br> - I know about that.<br> - Have you read the letters?<br> - Well, no.<br> - No. I suspected as much.<br> That's why I've flown over here.<br> I and the 1,673 people I represent,<br> whose names are on this petition,<br> will not allow their futures<br> to be determined by bureaucrats<br> at the beck and call<br> of industrialists like yourself,<br> for whom the elderly and children<br> are just figures in a ledger.<br> - Do I make myself clear?<br> - But...<br> There are no buts. You can call<br> your guards and have me dragged out.<br> - It would be bad publicity.<br> - Why don't just sit down?<br> - I prefer to stand.<br> - We can stand.<br> I've made it my business to find out<br> about Exo-Grey Industries.<br> Facts that would make<br> interesting newspaper copy.<br> - Your tea, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> - Oh, right... Yeah. My tea.<br> Will there be anything else,<br> Mr Farnswon'th?<br> No. I think that's about it.<br> Thanks a lot. You want some tea?<br> I want to know what<br> you're going to do about Pagglesham.<br> Pagglesham!<br> It's what we're talking about!<br> These people care<br> that their community<br> isn't destroyed in the name<br> of free enterprise.<br> A community where families<br> have lived for generations...<br> I know about Pagglesham...<br> These people will not let you<br> intimidate and frighten them.<br> I don't frighten anybody.<br> - What in God's name was that?<br> - Well, that was...<br> ...my... Mrs Farnswon'th.<br> Sorry to disturb you. Mrs Farnswon'th<br> saw a mouse, but she's better now.<br> - She just saw a mouse?<br> - No, outside. But she relives it.<br> I'll be in the other room<br> if you need me, sir. Excuse me.<br> - What's the matter with her?<br> - Well, listen...<br> - It's really none of my business.<br> - Your wife's not your business?<br> You don't understand...<br> We will never let you build<br> that refinery.<br> All right. I'll build my refinery<br> in some other place.<br> Very funny. If you think I'm going<br> back to Pagglesham, you're wrong.<br> I know you're not afraid of me.<br> You think a schoolteacher is no<br> challenge for a famous industrialist,<br> - but believe me...<br> - Will you please listen?<br> Just be quiet a minute.<br> Just let me say one thing.<br> - What is it?<br> - Sit down.<br> Why?<br> I think I can explain something<br> that'll clear this whole thing up.<br> I'm not really Leo Farnswon'th.<br> - What?<br> - My name is Joe.<br> Very funny. I'm sure you enjoy<br> playing these insulting little games.<br> However, I know about<br> your board meeting on Thursday,<br> which may mean nothing to you,<br> but if you think you can treat women<br> with the same contempt<br> your company treats<br> communities of the world,<br> you've a lot to learn about<br> the strength of people like myself.<br> Don't think you're getting away<br> with this. You're not!<br> You got till that meeting<br> on Thursday<br> to find me a body<br> that can play quarterback.<br> Darling, I'm going to let you go.<br> I'm going to let you go now.<br> Please stop screaming.<br> Listen. There is nothing<br> to be frightened of.<br> There's plenty to be worried about,<br> but nothing to be frightened of.<br> Are you all right? Can I trust you?<br> Yes, dearest?<br> - You locked me in a closet.<br> - For a moment.<br> - What did you tell him?<br> - You saw a mouse.<br> Look, I'm no good<br> at spur-of-the-moment alibis.<br> He's probably got enough evidence<br> to lock us away forever.<br> I don't understand this.<br> I saw him inale the nose spray.<br> He never really inaled it.<br> He overheard us somehow.<br> Maybe he's got us bugged right now.<br> No, an electronics expert<br> sweeps the place daily.<br> - He's afraid of being bugged, too.<br> - He's playing with us.<br> He's playing a game with us,<br> that's what it is.<br> - You locked me in a closet. Why?<br> - Hello.<br> Mr Farnswon'th would like<br> to see you now.<br> Yes, indeed. Would you<br> excuse me, Mrs Farnswon'th?<br> Yes, of course, Mr Abbott.<br> We could raise it at the meeting,<br> but I'm sure it's legal.<br> But can't something be legal<br> but still wrong?<br> - In what sense?<br> - Bad for somebody else.<br> - What are you referring to?<br> - Like this refinery in Pagglesham.<br> - Was that the living room?<br> - That was my office.<br> - My coordination is shot?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Just not my day.<br> - No, sir.<br> I wanted to discuss the Haitian<br> arrangement. The 2.5 million acres.<br> - 2.5 million acres?<br> - The sugar deal.<br> - It's no good.<br> - The deal?<br> - No, the sugar. It's bad for the body.<br> - Shall I speak to the ambassador?<br> No, check on Pagglesham,<br> see if we're hurting anybody.<br> - If we're hurting anybody?<br> - Yeah.<br> Is the wicket bugged?<br> We certainly wouldn't<br> want to hurt anybody.<br> That's the last thing Exo-Grey<br> would ever want to do, right?<br> Yeah. We don't want to hurt anybody.<br> Thank you.<br> Pagglesham.<br> He pretended not to know<br> what a stockholder was!<br> I can't tell if he's toying with me<br> or actually precipitating a crisis.<br> He's toying.<br> He won't forget being drugged.<br> - Why would he pretend?<br> - Why pretend to inale the spray?<br> To bait us,<br> waiting for us to crack.<br> Do you think he's playing<br> that saxophone? It's a tape.<br> That's why we keep hearing<br> the same song.<br> It's like those<br> idiot costumes of his...<br> You are dumb, aren't you?<br> Thanks. Thank you.<br> Their magic number is one,<br> meaning a Ram victory Sunday<br> or next week against the Falcons<br> or a 49er loss, and the Rams clinch<br> the NFL Western Division title.<br> The way they're playing,<br> the team feels this is the Rams' year<br> to go to the Super Bowl.<br> Jarrett has completed<br> an astounding 62% of his passes<br> for 18 touchdowns.<br> The defence has given up<br> but 10 points a game,<br> while the offence<br> scores 21 points a game.<br> Their record is the best...<br> What you mean is<br> nobody should have that information,<br> because if two big companies get<br> together, they're won'th more money?<br> Yes, sir.<br> That's why the rumour of a merger<br> makes the price of the stock rise.<br> If it's supposed to be a secret,<br> how does the rumour start?<br> Wrong as it seems,<br> they leak it.<br> - But that's dishonest.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> If I got a board meeting tomorrow,<br> I got to study tonight.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - How you doing down there?<br> I'm doing fine.<br> Thank you very much. Very well.<br> Thanks. Thanks a lot.<br> Say, thanks for dinner.<br> I think we should do it right away.<br> Sisk, may we have some<br> more coffee, please?<br> And now for your hat, sir.<br> The homburg or the bowler,<br> or something that makes<br> more of a statement?<br> Whatever you say. Why have I got<br> so many of these sailor outfits?<br> Sir, you have<br> always fancied the sea.<br> - Do I sail?<br> - Not really, sir.<br> Helen Rich from The Times.<br> I have a petition from Pagglesham.<br> Do you plan to do anything?<br> We're considering it.<br> We have to be going. Excuse us.<br> Is it true that the new factories<br> will displace 11 communities?<br> - Is it that many?<br> - They granted permits, didn't they?<br> - I guess so, if we got 'em.<br> - How did you get those permits?<br> Beats me. I guess we bribed somebody.<br> - He's joking.<br> - Funny.<br> Really, we must be going.<br> - What about Acrilonitrile?<br> - What about what?<br> The toxic substance released<br> by the plastic bottles you market,<br> despite the lawsuit forcing you<br> to delay until the effects are tested.<br> - We really must go.<br> - I've been studying this thing.<br> I've got it figured out, so come<br> and see what's going on yourselves.<br> - You can't have outsiders...<br> - Sure we can. Come in, everybody.<br> Is he kidding?<br> Hi. How you doing, everybody?<br> These people are<br> newspaper reporters.<br> I thought it would be good<br> if they saw how we did things.<br> This is a very dangerous precedent.<br> We have a full agenda today already.<br> We don't have time for a press...<br> Is it true that an accident<br> in your nuclear plant<br> could stimulate seismic activity<br> in the San Andreas Fault,<br> and destroy<br> most of southern California?<br> I think you'd have<br> to define "destroy".<br> Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,<br> I'd like to make something clear.<br> The Exo-Grey nuclear facility<br> has a foolproof<br> built-in safety system that<br> guarantees no danger of any kind.<br> That's rubbish.<br> If there's no danger,<br> why are we in a lawsuit?<br> It's a protest, not a lawsuit.<br> The point is<br> we're doing something wrong.<br> Everybody's suing us.<br> We got a lawsuit from a refinery...<br> ...a nuclear lawsuit,<br> a guy named Porpoise is suing us.<br> Mr Farnswon'th,<br> that's an ecological suit<br> against our canning factory<br> for destroying porpoises.<br> - For God's sake, he knows that.<br> - We can porpoises?<br> Our San Diego fleet...<br> As everybody knows, we can tuna,<br> and in netting the tuna,<br> we kill a number of porpoises.<br> Since they're mammals<br> of alleged high intelligence,<br> there's been an outcry.<br> Yeah, well... Yeah... Yeah.<br> I would just like<br> to ask you a question.<br> - Why is he bringing the press here?<br> - You know Leo Farnswon'th.<br> - Maybe I don't know him.<br> - Exactly.<br> We have responsibility<br> to thousands of shareholders<br> of moderate means, less well off than<br> the ecological groups fighting us.<br> If we were a football team,<br> would you call this a winning season?<br> I haven't the faintest...<br> Just generally. Would you say<br> we got a winning season?<br> On balance,<br> we've had an extremely good year.<br> We've got a winning season.<br> What do you do<br> when you're ahead?<br> - I don't know what you want.<br> - You don't make mistakes.<br> You don't gamble unnecessarily.<br> You protect your lead.<br> You don't pass from your own end.<br> You make sure nobody gets hurt.<br> You got to use these guys<br> in the next game.<br> We won this game. We got to stay<br> in shape for the rest of the game.<br> It's like when everybody was supposed<br> to stop eating grapes.<br> I didn't because I like grapes.<br> A lot of guys will keep eating tuna.<br> What if we had a good-guy<br> tuna company on the porpoise team?<br> A lot of guys would buy that so<br> their kids wouldn't get mad at them.<br> I don't think they're<br> taking into account the expense.<br> We don't care how much it costs,<br> just how much it makes.<br> If it costs too much,<br> we charge a penny more.<br> Would you pay more<br> to save a fish who thinks?<br> - That's not bad.<br> - We handle all lawsuits that way.<br> Let other teams build plants<br> in the wrong places.<br> Let the other quarterback<br> throw a gurgle<br> so newspapers get hold of it<br> and stockholders don't like it.<br> Let's be the team that makes<br> the rules, plays fair,<br> that gets the best contract,<br> that's popular.<br> Forget these nuclear power plants<br> until we know they're safe.<br> That Pagglesham refinery,<br> we'll have to relocate it.<br> It'll cost us $35 million,<br> but we don't care,<br> because we'll come out ahead<br> in the end.<br> That plastic stuff we're making,<br> we'll have to stop.<br> We're not here for just one game.<br> We're going all the way<br> to the Super Bowl!<br> And we'll already have won!<br> - Hi. How you doing?<br> - Fine, thank you. Very well...<br> What's happening?<br> ... give the Rams advantage<br> through the playoffs.<br> The Super Bowl is set<br> for the Coliseum.<br> If he werert going to be dead soon,<br> he'd need years of psychiatric help.<br> Let's do it tonight.<br> The Rams will probably face Dallas<br> in the opening round. If they win...<br> - Mr Pendleton.<br> - Hey!<br> Am I glad to see you.<br> Line up any bodies yet?<br> We haven't got a lot of time. Lf...<br> ... and only four measly field goals...<br> Hi. I... I'm just...<br> - What's up?<br> - Some interesting probabilities.<br> I kept my word to Betty Logan.<br> Did you find a body in good shape?<br> I want to see some bodies.<br> ... someone who can throw.<br> The Super Bowl's coming up.<br> You must have checked out<br> a lot of bodies...<br> - Who is it?<br> - It's Sisk, sir.<br> Come in, Sisk.<br> Sorry to disturb you, Mr Farnswon'th,<br> but Miss Logan is downstairs<br> and asks if she might have<br> a moment of your time.<br> - Tell her I'll be right down.<br> - Very good, sir.<br> Do you...? Do you wish<br> the door closed, sir?<br> Closed is fine. Thank you.<br> Do your best.<br> I gotta find out what she wants.<br> I don't know what you must think<br> of me after my behaviour,<br> but I feel I must tell you what<br> an extraordinary thing you did today.<br> - Really quite extraordinary.<br> - You don't have to say...<br> - Because I...<br> - It's...<br> You know what? You look a little<br> pale. You want something to eat?<br> - Well...<br> - I'll be right back.<br> Bentley. Everett. Miss Logars<br> going to have dinner with us.<br> Whip up a liver and whey shake.<br> Where you going?<br> Oh, I thought...<br> You thought I meant to go out.<br> Sisk, we're going out. Come on.<br> Bentley! Everett!<br> We're going out and eat. Good idea.<br> - Which hat would you prefer?<br> - Look, I don't want a hat.<br> I'm sick of hats. Don't show me<br> any more hats. Understand?<br> Yes, sir. No more hats.<br> - Do you eat here often?<br> - Are you...? Now, look...<br> I just didn't think you'd want people<br> to see you out with a guy like me.<br> I see.<br> Pick up 24. Pick up 28.<br> I'm sorry. I just can't stop<br> staring at you.<br> I seem to be staring at you, too.<br> Even when I was trying to hate you,<br> I saw something else.<br> - Something...<br> - What?<br> In your eyes. Does that sound silly?<br> When you see that, it doesn't matter<br> who a person is or anything.<br> What is it?<br> This isn't what I thought<br> was going to happen to me.<br> Listen, I got to talk<br> to somebody right away.<br> Would you mind if I took you home?<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> By the way, I'm getting a divorce.<br> But you're not even separated.<br> Sure we are. It's a big house.<br> - How you doing, Bentley?<br> - Fine, sir.<br> I don't want that body<br> we talked about.<br> Something happened tonight...<br> This is an outrage.<br> We've gone to enormous difficulty<br> to find an athlete.<br> I wanted it, but something happened<br> with Betty Logan and now I don't.<br> I'll get Farnswon'th into shape.<br> I'll get Corkle to help me.<br> - Back in there?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> I can do it. I know more about<br> getting into shape than anybody.<br> - So hold up on that body.<br> - Hold up?<br> Tell Mr Jordan not to worry about it.<br> Thank him.<br> I'm sorry, I want to get<br> into shape with this body.<br> You leave me speechless.<br> I have nothing to say to that.<br> I can't even think how to retort<br> to something as ridiculous<br> as turning down a body<br> we've gone to such extremes to find.<br> An athlete in prime condition.<br> What can I say?<br> What do I do with his cocoa?<br> I don't want to disturb him,<br> but dare I let it get cold?<br> I notice there are two cups.<br> Sisk felt since he was pretending<br> to talk to somebody,<br> he might want to pretend<br> to give him cocoa, too.<br> How you doing, Everett?<br> How you doing, Bentley?<br> Hurry up. Wait a minute.<br> Just a minute, please. All right.<br> Sorry to bother you, but we don't<br> love each other. Let's get divorced.<br> - I don't know what you're saying.<br> - Come on. Yes, you do.<br> Abbott, there's a trainer<br> for the Rams named Max Corkle.<br> Could you call and ask him<br> to come see me?<br> - Yes, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> You idiot! You idiot!<br> Why did you answer him?<br> I couldn't resist.<br> His will is too strong.<br> That's our weekend forecast.<br> Now here's tonight's sports.<br> Leach and Char will have to...<br> He's dead. It's over with.<br> At last, at last.<br> At last, my dearest.<br> It's incredible.<br> Yes! Just a minute. Yes!<br> Yes, Sisk.<br> And, Abbott, Corkle's number<br> is 654-1654. All right?<br> - Yes, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> - OK.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Right this way.<br> Mr Farnswon'th is waiting for you<br> in the ballroom. Follow me, please.<br> - Mr Corkle, sir.<br> - Max. How you doing?<br> Fine.<br> - Lost a little weight, huh?<br> - Have we met?<br> Sort of, yeah. Thanks, Sisk.<br> I hear you got all Joe Pendletors<br> athletic equipment.<br> Yeah. How d'you know that?<br> I'd like to buy it.<br> I'd like to bring it in here.<br> No, I'm sorry, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> That's not for sale.<br> What do you want it for?<br> I've got to get in shape.<br> I'd like you to help me train.<br> - Train?<br> - Yeah. As soon as I'm ready...<br> I want you to get me<br> a tryout with the Rams.<br> - What are you trying out for?<br> - Quarterback.<br> Quarterback?<br> The point is, Mr Farnswon'th,<br> we already got a quarterback<br> working with the team.<br> We got a couple<br> of pretty good backups.<br> You call Hodges good, huh?<br> The point is<br> we don't need a quarterback.<br> Why don't you try another team?<br> The Oakland Raiders are close.<br> Give them a call.<br> I want to play quarterback<br> and get in shape for the Super Bowl.<br> What would it cost to try out?<br> Look, Mr Farnswon'th,<br> no team wants a crazy trainer,<br> and only a crazy trainer<br> would arrange a tryout for you.<br> You keep your money,<br> I'll keep my job,<br> and we'll keep this little<br> misunderstanding to ourselves.<br> That's all right,<br> I'll finish that up.<br> What would you say if I told you<br> I was a professional football player?<br> - These... These are nice.<br> - Max, you know how people die?<br> Yeah. Why?<br> And after they die,<br> they go to heaven?<br> I guess, if they're good.<br> I mean, why not?<br> You know how it works in heaven?<br> - Not exactly.<br> - It's probability and outcome.<br> I never knew that.<br> Say there's a probability<br> that some guy's going to die.<br> An escort from his way station<br> gets a signal.<br> He goes down<br> and waits for the outcome.<br> If the guy lives,<br> the escort wasted a trip.<br> If he dies, he takes him back<br> to his way station.<br> He puts him in line for his<br> final destination. You follow?<br> Mind if I smoke?<br> Go ahead. Let's say there's<br> a new escort. He gets a signal.<br> He takes off and sees a guy<br> riding a bicycle into a tunnel.<br> The car's coming the other way,<br> the escort's supposed to wait,<br> but he's new and figures<br> the guy's a goner.<br> He figures,<br> why should I have the car hit him?<br> Why not take him out<br> a few seconds early<br> and take him up to his way station?<br> - Listen, I need a match.<br> - That clock, that's a lighter.<br> So the guy he takes up to the way<br> station isn't just some ordinary guy.<br> He's an athlete<br> with fantastic reflexes.<br> He wouldn't have hit<br> the car at all.<br> - How do you light this?<br> - There.<br> The guy wasrt really dead.<br> His number wasrt up for years.<br> He would have missed the car.<br> No kidding? Is this lighter right?<br> They're supposed to put him back<br> in his body, but he's been cremated.<br> - They have to find another body.<br> - Look, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> I'm just a trainer. What you need<br> is a really good doctor.<br> - Don't you understand?<br> - Sure. That's a hell of a story.<br> Mr Jordan, I'm so glad to see you!<br> I'm trying to get<br> Farnswon'th into shape.<br> - I want Corkle to help.<br> - Who are you talking to?<br> Mr Jordan. He runs the way station.<br> You can't see him.<br> You're still alive.<br> You two probably got a lot<br> to talk about. I'll be on my way.<br> - Wait a second, Max.<br> - Tell him who you are, Joe.<br> He'll never believe me, you tell him.<br> He's the only person who can get me<br> a tryout with the Rams.<br> You can make him believe you.<br> - Look at me.<br> - Mr Farnswon'th...<br> Max! I'm not Farnswon'th.<br> I'm Joe Pendleton.<br> Farnswon'th's wife<br> and secretary murdered him.<br> This is a body they found for me.<br> They drugged him,<br> then I stepped in.<br> It's not bad material.<br> I can get it into shape.<br> - I don't want to hear any more.<br> - Max, please.<br> I want to get out of here.<br> I won't tell a word to anybody.<br> I promise. It'll be our little secret.<br> A secret? Like your sister<br> and the Coca-Cola salesman?<br> - What about the scar on your tongue?<br> - How did you...?<br> What did you do<br> at your uncle's wedding?<br> What about the first time<br> I fixed your neck in Pittsburgh?<br> Now do you believe me, Max?<br> Please say you believe me.<br> They don't have a team in heaven,<br> so God couldn't make me first-string.<br> He doesn't believe me.<br> Try a little music.<br> That's a great persuader.<br> Joe, you never could play that thing.<br> You all right, Max? You all right?<br> Bentley! Whip up a liver and whey<br> shake right away!<br> I'm gonna play in the Super Bowl.<br> That's what's coming to me.<br> If that's what you've got coming.<br> - He's still here?<br> - Right there.<br> Listen to me.<br> Farnswon'th isn't in bad shape.<br> I still know the moves.<br> Just help me with the body.<br> Thanks, Mr Jordan.<br> Sisk! How about that liver<br> and whey shake? Hurry up.<br> - I need it for Mr Corkle.<br> - Yes, sir. Right away.<br> I want the whole staff to suit up.<br> We're going into training.<br> Listen, Mr... Jordan, is it?<br> You still there?<br> Any time you want to chime in...<br> why, just feel free.<br> Feel free.<br> I'm telling you to feel free!<br> You got to help me<br> talk Joe out of this.<br> If I get him a tryout,<br> that team will put him<br> out of commission like that.<br> Christ, I can't even snap<br> my fingers any more. Sorry.<br> He's not there.<br> Don't get crazy. I'm counting on you.<br> This isn't going to work.<br> We're fooling with the Rams.<br> It's just... Well, all right.<br> I'm still figuring out<br> what I'll say.<br> You're playing football<br> with a bunch of butlers.<br> - This isn't gonna work!<br> - I fixed all that.<br> - How?<br> - I bought the Rams.<br> Leo Farnswon'th has bought this team,<br> and he wants to play quarterback.<br> - Shit!<br> - Crazy son of a bitch.<br> Bullshit!<br> Wait a minute.<br> This is the way it is.<br> He'll play quarterback<br> in Wednesday's scrimmage.<br> At which time,<br> the coach will decide<br> whether he's qualified<br> for the job or not.<br> Mr Farnswon'th says,<br> "Tell no one to hold back."<br> These were his words, I quote,<br> "Play that scrimmage<br> like the Super Bowl."<br> - Take him at his word.<br> - Let's kill him.<br> My team.<br> That son of a bitch got my team.<br> What kind of pressure<br> did he use, Milt?<br> Well, I asked for 67 million,<br> and he said OK.<br> Ruthless bastard.<br> Well, very, very nice.<br> Very, very, impressive.<br> I'm Tony Abbott, Mr Farnswon'th's<br> personal private executive secretary.<br> Very nice. Very... very nice.<br> Don't let any of Mr Farnswon'th's<br> racial statements offend you.<br> Nice talking to you.<br> Get rid of that ball fast, all right?<br> Good luck, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> Don't worry about the plays.<br> I got them down last night.<br> I want to run a split right, X-go,<br> Z-curl, a Y-straight.<br> Like the Super Bowl. Break.<br> - Ready? Break.<br> - Tighten it up.<br> Look at 'em.<br> That's how they look when they eat.<br> - Look out.<br> - 4-3, set!<br> Sorry, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> - Nice.<br> - Let's try it again, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> OK, let's go! Let's go!<br> Try it with the ball!<br> Come on, positions!<br> - Playing football is so much fun.<br> - Try this time.<br> - Set!<br> - Come on now!<br> I'm terribly sorry, Mr Farnswon'th.<br> This is really embarrassing.<br> I guess you went offsides.<br> Come on, guys,<br> get him, get him!<br> Give me a little more room, Billy.<br> Let's all try and stay onsides.<br> - Better get a stretcher.<br> - Jesus!<br> He's an eccentric.<br> We've always known that.<br> Buying a football team for 67 million<br> that has a book value of 19?<br> Three weeks ago,<br> the stock was selling at 56.<br> This morning it opened at 14.<br> - You want a rest, Mr Farnswon'th?<br> - No, it's OK.<br> Mr Farnswon'th is taking the Rams<br> to the Super Bowl as a quarterback.<br> No sign of aberration<br> in his behaviour?<br> Nothing in his personal life<br> bothering him?<br> That statement speaks for itself.<br> All right, I'm going to save<br> you guys some trouble.<br> Want me to quit?<br> Give me the ball once.<br> If I don't hit Evans,<br> I'll quit. Ready?<br> Look out!<br> On three! Set!<br> Beautiful!<br> There's a potential there! He's...<br> - Take it easy.<br> - I know.<br> - Shit, man, what you doing?<br> - What's he doing?<br> Ready? Break.<br> Red right, red right. Watch the pass.<br> Not bad.<br> I think we got us<br> a rich quarterback.<br> He's looking awful good.<br> Boy, you pulled it off.<br> Yeah? I don't know.<br> I think I can do it.<br> Mr Farnswon'th, play any college ball?<br> No. I played a little polo.<br> Look, he's posing<br> with the whole football team.<br> That's not a football team.<br> There are old men<br> and skinny younger men.<br> Look at the women.<br> That's the ecology group<br> Exo-Grey is funding.<br> He's getting ready to spring a trap.<br> This whole thing.<br> The football team gag,<br> the ecology crap, the divorce...<br> He hasn't announced<br> is our divorce and when he does,<br> I'll be the first suspect<br> when we kill him.<br> Darling, perhaps I'm being silly,<br> but I'd be more comfortable...<br> Have I offended you in some way?<br> Don't put your hand<br> over my mouth.<br> - You used to like it.<br> - If we don't act now, we'll lose it.<br> I was mad to sign<br> a prenuptial agreement.<br> I'll get an allowance.<br> You'll be fired.<br> - We'll have each other.<br> - Not after he brings charges...<br> Don't try it!<br> Want to make a wish?<br> - Yes.<br> - All right. There.<br> - Go ahead.<br> - Very good.<br> Do you think it's silly,<br> trying to be a football player?<br> Of course not. That's what you want.<br> - You think I can do it?<br> - You can do anything you want to.<br> Anything you committed yourself<br> to do, you could do.<br> Because I'm a big wheel<br> at Exo-Grey?<br> - You're not afraid of things.<br> - Afraid of things? Why would I be?<br> You know, most people are<br> afraid of something, aren't they?<br> You want to know<br> the only thing I'm afraid of?<br> How I'd feel<br> if I couldn't be with you.<br> Then there's nothing<br> to be afraid of, is there?<br> - Got to go.<br> - Wait a minute. I...<br> How would you feel about marrying me?<br> - It's crazy?<br> - No, it doesn't sound crazy.<br> - You know, if I...<br> - What is it? What is it?<br> Could you wait here?<br> I'll be right back.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I'm sorry, Mr Pendleton.<br> You won't be able to use<br> Mr Farnswon'th's body any longer.<br> What are you talking about?<br> Just what I said.<br> Your time is up.<br> You said I'd get to the Super Bowl.<br> Whatever you do, it won't be<br> with Mr Farnswon'th's body.<br> - Why not?<br> - It wasrt meant to be.<br> - Why not?<br> - Stop saying that!<br> I won't pay for your mistake.<br> - Look, Mr Pendleton...<br> - I'm not talking to you.<br> I'd like to talk to Mr Jordan.<br> We'll settle this once and for all.<br> Get out of here. You're bad news.<br> Is something wrong?<br> I just got to straighten<br> something out.<br> Maybe I better walk you to the car.<br> Something is wrong, isn't it?<br> - I was just thinking, Betty.<br> - What?<br> We got a great life ahead,<br> you and me,<br> and nobody's going<br> to take that away from us.<br> Why are you looking at me like that?<br> I'm memorising your face. I want<br> to memorise everything about you<br> so no matter what happens,<br> I won't forget you.<br> - What's going to happen?<br> - Nothing's going to happen.<br> You'd never forget me either,<br> would you?<br> That thing you said you saw in me.<br> Something in my eyes, remember?<br> If some day somebody came up to you,<br> maybe a football player,<br> and he acted like<br> he'd seen you before,<br> you'd notice that same thing, right?<br> You'd give him a chance?<br> He might be a good guy.<br> - He could even be a quarterback.<br> - I don't understand.<br> I'm just acting crazy.<br> It's all right.<br> There's nothing to be afraid of.<br> - You must abide by what is written.<br> - Why?<br> There's a reason for everything.<br> There's always a plan.<br> - How can I give up Farnswon'th now?<br> - I'm sorry, Joe.<br> - You said I'd get to the Super Bowl.<br> - Yes, if it's meant to be.<br> - I'm not leaving.<br> - Sorry.<br> I'm not leaving, Mr Jordan.<br> Joe, you asked<br> for a temporary arrangement.<br> I never went back on a deal,<br> but I am now. I'm not going.<br> Your destiny is not in my hands.<br> Please don't make it more difficult.<br> I won't. I'm just not going to do it.<br> - You must abide by what is written.<br> - She loves me, Mr Jordan.<br> You must abide by what is written.<br> - Have you seen Mr Farnswon'th?<br> - No, sir, I haven't.<br> - Guess I'll just keep looking.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Joe, you in here?<br> Are you in there, Mr Farnswon'th?<br> Listen, Your Highness, I'm telling<br> you what I told the mayor last week.<br> By the end of the week,<br> I'll crack this case.<br> Right. Another Arab.<br> Son of a bitch Farnswon'th<br> was into everything,<br> and now he's vanished, disappeared.<br> This is the craziest nut<br> I've ever dealt with.<br> He wasrt fooling around.<br> If he was alive, he'd be here.<br> You're asking me to believe Leo<br> Farnswon'th asked you to marry him?<br> Yes. He was going to get a divorce.<br> When I left, he said he'd call me,<br> but something happened.<br> - How do you know?<br> - Because he didn't call me.<br> He would have kept his word.<br> With less than 24 hours<br> before the big game,<br> the whereabouts of Leo Farnswon'th<br> remains a mystery.<br> Farnswon'th said his wife and<br> Tony Abbott were trying to kill him.<br> Let me spring it on Abbott,<br> I can make him crack.<br> Take Corkle to the Farnswon'th house.<br> The game!<br> If you win this one, you're going<br> to be champions of the world.<br> And they can take away<br> the money and the cheers.<br> They can take away the good looks,<br> but nobody will ever<br> take that away from you.<br> Let's go.<br> Let me get this straight.<br> You saw no specific changes<br> in Mr Farnswon'th's behaviour?<br> No, sir. A bit more talkative,<br> but other than that, normal.<br> And that's your opinion, too,<br> Mr Sisk?<br> Yes. I did notice he seemed<br> to take a dislike to his hats,<br> but it was never violent.<br> Ask me whatever you want...?<br> - Mr Corkle, please. Mr Everett?<br> - Yes?<br> - You had cocoa with him every night.<br> - Yes.<br> What did you talk about?<br> Well, he'd say something like,<br> "This cocoa is good, isn't it?"<br> And I'd say, "Yes, it is."<br> And then he'd say something like,<br> "I wish the marshmallow<br> would last longer."<br> And I'd say, "So do I."<br> Sometimes he talked about cookies.<br> Thank you, Mr Everett.<br> Did he mention disliking his hats?<br> What the hell is this?<br> What does it matter?<br> I'm following a line of questioning.<br> Please. Mr Everett, did he ever<br> say anything to you about his hats?<br> - Never, sir.<br> - Thank you, Mr Everett.<br> Mr Abbott, what did you discuss<br> the last time you saw him?<br> He was considering buying Haiti.<br> - The country?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Thank you, Mr Abbott.<br> Nothing about hats?<br> - No.<br> - Thank you, Mr Abbott.<br> Mrs Farnswon'th, how was your<br> relationship with your husband?<br> Very, very close. Very, very special.<br> Miss Logan claims<br> he was getting a divorce<br> and he asked her to marry him.<br> I don't doubt that.<br> My husband loved me<br> very much, but he was a man.<br> He would say or do anything<br> to make a conquest,<br> but it never touched our marriage.<br> That's what made it so special.<br> They're pinning it on Betty.<br> Miss Logan, I am sorry if I've said<br> anything that's hurt you.<br> I don't know you well enough<br> for you to hurt me.<br> - I hope you don't doubt my word.<br> - I don't, I'm sure you're lying.<br> I assume if Mr Farnswon'th told you<br> about disliking his hats,<br> you'd let us know.<br> You want to know about his hats?<br> He wouldn't wear socks with a suit!<br> Every time he crossed his legs,<br> you could see his ankles were bare!<br> That's when he stopped wearing hats.<br> They looked funny without socks!<br> But he never told you<br> he disliked them.<br> - What?<br> - His hats.<br> Are you crazy? What kind<br> of questions are you asking?<br> All right. Sit down.<br> Conway, turn that thing on.<br> - Let him watch the game.<br> - Everything will be all right.<br> We're getting a clearer picture<br> of Mr Farnswon'th's patterns.<br> There's a reason for everything.<br> There's got to be.<br> It's a demanding defence.<br> You don't need to worry about her.<br> Tom Jarrett, the Rams' quarterback,<br> back to pass.<br> Looking, scrambling. He's in trouble.<br> And he's hit hard! Down he goes!<br> You're telling me<br> that Mr Farnswon'th<br> never carried any money<br> or credit cards, right?<br> And no identification papers?<br> - Right, sir. Yes.<br> - Then what we have here...<br> The score, 24-24. Overtime.<br> The way he was hit,<br> Tom Jarrett is hurt.<br> We can see<br> the Ram players are concerned,<br> they're calling for the stretcher.<br> Jarrett has not moved.<br> It'll be a miracle, frankly,<br> and I hope he's well.<br> It doesn't look good.<br> They order Jerry Hodges to start<br> warming up on the sidelines.<br> The Pittsburgh defence<br> has been brilliant.<br> They've stopped the Rams...<br> The Haitian ambassador's here.<br> - Oh, yes. Thank you, Sisk.<br> - Tell him to wait.<br> Who do you think you are?<br> You call this an investigation!<br> - Now, Corkle!<br> - Your men standing around watching!<br> How'd you do it this time?<br> Drug him like before?<br> Lieutenant, I will not be spoken to<br> in this way in my house.<br> Why did it have to be Jarrett?<br> Because it's his time, Joe.<br> It's his destiny.<br> - Look at the pupils!<br> - Bill! Get that ambulance!<br> - Jarret comes back into the game.<br> - Joe!<br> Oh, my God! It's his jacket!<br> So it's you, Mr Abbott!<br> I should have known<br> I couldn't trust you.<br> - Here's your murderer!<br> - She did it!<br> I'll confess she did it!<br> She's been planning it for years!<br> - Corkle, where are you going?<br> - To the Coliseum.<br> - I'm conducting an investigation.<br> - I'm going.<br> Take this investigation<br> and shove it up your ass!<br> It's sudden death!<br> The crowd's delirious!<br> Jarrett was sacked hard.<br> He's getting up. He's OK.<br> A remarkable comeback by Jarrett.<br> The first team that scores, wins...<br> We're number one! We're number one!<br> - Hi, Max.<br> - I am right, it is you, isn't it?<br> I knew it! I knew it!<br> I was watching the TV,<br> and I said, "That's him!"<br> The Rams are champions!<br> Here's the star, Tom Jarrett.<br> He led his team to victory.<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Good.<br> Describe your feelings.<br> - World champions!<br> - I... I feel good.<br> I have to go now, Joe. It's time.<br> I can't stay here any longer.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - How does it feel to be Tom Jarrett?<br> And when I've gone,<br> you won't remember me.<br> You'll be Thomas Jarrett<br> with no memory of Joe Pendleton,<br> or Leo Farnswon'th<br> or anything that's happened.<br> This is your destiny, Joe.<br> You're back on your own road now.<br> - What do you mean, I won't remember?<br> - Goodbye, Joe.<br> There's a lot of confusion.<br> - Wait. I got to talk to you. Wait.<br> - Goodbye.<br> Congratulations.<br> Here he is, Coach...<br> You OK, Tom? You OK?<br> Here's Lamar Crawford, the man<br> who caught one of those key passes.<br> I'm just happy that we won.<br> In September, I told you<br> the beginning of this season!<br> Hey, Benny! Hey, Joe! Uh, Tom!<br> - Hey, Doc. Did Tom leave?<br> - He's putting some ice on his eye.<br> He'll be all right.<br> That's something about Farnswon'th.<br> - Poor son of a bitch.<br> - Yeah...<br> Corkle. What are you doing,<br> closing up the joint?<br> I didn't know you played that thing.<br> - What are you talking about?<br> - Is that yours?<br> What are you talking about?<br> - What?<br> - You know what I mean.<br> I mean,<br> what are you talking about, Joe?<br> Am I missing something?<br> Come on. What are you<br> trying to do to me, huh?<br> I'm the guy that got hit in the head.<br> You sure you're all right, Corkle?<br> Play something<br> for me on this thing, huh?<br> That's the way it is<br> with champagne, huh?<br> You just keep swallowing it<br> 'cause it doesn't taste like anything,<br> and all of a sudden, you're drunk.<br> You going to the party, Corkle?<br> I'll give you a ride.<br> A little fresh air wouldn't hurt.<br> Look, just do me one favour.<br> Look at me.<br> - Just look at me.<br> - What?<br> You want to tell me<br> why you're calling me Joe?<br> I guess it has something<br> to do with Joe Pendleton.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't think, Corkle.<br> You don't want a ride?<br> No, I'll just...<br> I'm going to sit here for a minute.<br> Hey, son, you...<br> You played a hell of a game.<br> Thanks, Corkle. You all right?<br> Excuse me.<br> Where might I find Max Corkle?<br> - I believe he's here somewhere.<br> - He's in the locker room.<br> Go back up the way you came,<br> or go back and take a right<br> and then a left.<br> - It's the second door on the right.<br> - I see. Thank you. Thank you.<br> He's not expecting me.<br> Can I just walk in?<br> Sure. He's the only guy in there.<br> - Have we met?<br> - No. I don't think so.<br> No, I guess we haven't. I'm sorry.<br> - What did you think of the game?<br> - I didn't see it.<br> Does your eye hurt?<br> No, no, I...<br> Listen, my name's Tom Jarrett.<br> - Hello. I'm Betty Logan.<br> - Yeah. It's nice to meet you.<br> - You must play for the Rams.<br> - Yeah. You interested in football?<br> - A friend of mine was.<br> - Was?<br> Leo Farnswon'th.<br> - I'm sorry. Was he a close friend?<br> - Yes, he was very close.<br> - That's too bad. I'm sorry.<br> - Have you put some ice on that?<br> - What's that?<br> - They're just closing up the place.<br> Here, give me your hand.<br> There's nothing to be afraid of.<br> - What did you say?<br> - What?<br> When you said<br> "There's nothing to be afraid of,"<br> your voice sounded so familiar.<br> Well, like I said,<br> I thought I knew you, too.<br> People always think<br> they knew somebody before.<br> Yes, they do.<br> I was going to meet<br> a bunch of people, have a party...<br> - I'm a little late.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> No, no, no...<br> All of a sudden,<br> I don't feel like going to a party,<br> and I thought maybe if... I mean...<br> You want to have a cup of coffee<br> or something?<br> Well, I guess not.<br> You're the quarterback.<br> Yeah. How'd you know that?<br> Yes, I'd love to have<br> a cup of coffee with you.<br>
