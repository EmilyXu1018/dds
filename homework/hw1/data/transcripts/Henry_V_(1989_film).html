We would be resolved<br> before we hear him<br> of some things of weight that task<br> our thoughts, concerning us and France.<br> God and his angels<br> guard your sacred throne<br> and make you long become it.<br> -

to whit,<br> no female should be inheritrix in Salic land,<br> which is this day in Germany<br> called Meissen.<br> Then doth it well appear the Salic Law<br> was not devised for the realm of France.<br> Nor did the French possess<br> the Salic land<br> until four hundred one-and-twenty years<br> after defunction of King...<br> (Laughter)<br> ..Pharamond, idly supposed<br> the founder of this law.<br> King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,<br> did, as heir general, being descended...<br> (Laughter)<br> ..of Blithild...<br> - (Roars of laughter)<br> - ..who was daughter to...<br> ..King Clotaire, made claim and title<br> to the throne of France.<br> Hugh Capet also,<br> which usurped the crown...<br> Er...<br> ..of Charles, the Duke of Lorraine,<br> sole heir male<br> of the true line and stock of...<br> (Laughter)<br> ..of Charles the Great,<br> could not keep quiet in his conscience,<br> wearing the crown of France,<br> till satisfied that fair...<br> that fair...that fair...<br> Queen Isabel, his grandmother,<br> was lineal of the Lady...of the Lady...<br> of the Lady...<br> of the Lady Ermengarde,<br> daughter to Charles,<br> the foresaid Duke of Lorraine.<br> So that, as clear as is<br> the summer's sun...<br> - (Laughter)<br> - ..all hold in right and title of the female.<br> So do the kings of France unto this day,<br> howbeit they would hold up<br> this Salic Law<br> to bar Your Highness<br> claiming from the female.<br> May I with right and conscience<br> make this claim?<br> The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,<br> for in the Book of Numbers it is writ,<br> "When the son die, let the inheritance<br> descend unto the daughter."<br> Gracious lord, stand your own.<br> Look back into your mighty ancestors.<br> Go, my dread lord,<br> to your great-grandsire's tomb<br> from whom you claim.<br> Invoke his warlike spirit,<br> and your great-uncle's,<br> Edward the Black Prince.<br> Your brother kings<br> and monarchs of the earth do all expect<br> that you should rouse yourself<br> as did the former lions of your blood.<br> They know your grace hath cause<br> and means and might.<br> So hath Your Highness.<br> Never king of England<br> had nobles richer or more loyal subjects,<br> whose hearts have left their bodies<br> here in England<br> and lie pavilioned in the fields of France.<br> O let their bodies follow, my dear liege,<br> with blood and sword and fire,<br> to win your right.<br> In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty<br> will raise Your Highness<br> such a mighty sum<br> as never did the clergy at one time<br> bring in to any of your ancestors.<br> Call in the messengers<br> sent from the Dauphin.<br> ( Fanfare)<br> Now are we well resolved,<br> and by God's help and yours,<br> the noble sinews of our power,<br> France being ours we'll bend it<br> to our awe<br> or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,<br> tombless, with no remembrance<br> over them.<br> ( March)<br> Now are we well prepared to know<br> the pleasure of our fair cousin Dauphin,<br> for we hear your greeting is from him,<br> not from the king.<br> May it please Your Majesty<br> to give us leave<br> freely to render what we have in charge,<br> or shall we sparingly show you far off<br> the Dauphin's meaning<br> and our embassy?<br> We are no tyrant, but a Christian King,<br> therefore with frank and with uncurbed<br> plainness tell us the Dauphin's mind.<br> Thus then in few.<br> Your Highness lately sending<br> into France<br> did claim some certain dukedoms,<br> in the right of your great predecessor,<br> King Edward the Third.<br> In answer to which claim,<br> the Prince our master<br> says that you savour<br> too much of your youth.<br> He therefore sends you,<br> fitter for your study,<br> this tun of treasure,<br> and in lieu of this desires you<br> let the dukedoms that you claim<br> hear no more of you.<br> This the Dauphin speaks.<br> What treasure, Uncle?<br> Tennis balls, my liege.<br> (Laughter)<br> We are glad the Dauphin<br> is so pleasant with us.<br> His present and your pains<br> we thank you for.<br> When we have matched our rackets<br> to these balls,<br> we will in France, by God's grace,<br> play a set shall strike his father's crown<br> into the hazard!<br> Tell him he hath made a match<br> with such a wrangler<br> that all the courts of France<br> will be disturbed with chases.<br> And we understand him well, how he comes<br> o'er us with our wilder days,<br> not measuring what use<br> we made of them.<br> But tell the Dauphin<br> we will keep our state,<br> be like a king,<br> and show our sail of greatness<br> when we do rouse us<br> in our throne of France.<br> And tell the pleasant prince<br> this mock of his<br> hath turned these balls to gunstones<br> and his soul shall stand sore charged<br> for the wasteful vengeance<br> that shall fly with them,<br> for many a thousand widows<br> shall this his mock,<br> mock out of their dear husbands,<br> mock mothers from their sons,<br> mock castles down.<br> Ay, some are yet ungotten and unborn<br> that shall have cause to curse<br> the Dauphin's scorn.<br> But this lies all within the will of God, to<br> whom we do appeal and in whose name<br> tell you the Dauphin we are coming<br> on to venge us as we may,<br> and to put forth our rightful claim<br> in a well-hallowed cause,<br> so get you hence in peace.<br> And tell the Dauphin<br> his jest will savour but of shallow wit<br> when thousands weep<br> more than did laugh at it.<br> Convey them with safe conduct.<br> Fare you well.<br> - This was a merry message.<br> - We hope to make the sender blush at it.<br> Therefore let our proportion for these wars<br> be soon collected,<br> and all things thought upon<br> that may with reasonable swiftness<br> add more feathers to our wings,<br> for, God before, we'll check this Dauphin<br> at his father's door.<br> ( March)<br> Now all the youth of England are on fire,<br> and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.<br> Now thrive the armourers,<br> and honour's thought<br> reigns solely in the breast of every man.<br> They sell the pasture now<br> to buy the horse,<br> following the mirror of all Christian kings<br> with winged heels, as English Mercuries.<br> For now sits expectation in the air<br> and hides a sword from hilt<br> unto the point<br> with crowns imperial,<br> crowns and coronets,<br> promised to Harry and his followers.<br> Linger your patience on,<br> for if we may, we'll not offend<br> one stomach with our play.<br> (Applause)<br> (Chatting)<br> (Thunder)<br> ( Fanfare)<br> Well met, Corporal Nym.<br> Oh. Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.<br> What, are Ensign Pistol<br> and you friends yet?<br> For my part, I care not. I say little.<br> But when time shall serve...<br> I will bestow a breakfast<br> to make you friends,<br> and we'll all go three sworn brothers<br> to France.<br> Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.<br> Well, I cannot tell.<br> Oh, it is certain<br> that he is married to Nell Quickly,<br> and certainly she did you wrong,<br> for you were betrothed to her.<br> Things must be as they may.<br> Men may sleep, they may have<br> their throats about them at that time.<br> - Some say knives have edges.<br> - Oh!<br> Well, I cannot tell.<br> Here comes Pistol and his wife.<br> Good corporal, be patient here.<br> (Cheering)<br> How now, mine host Pistol?<br> - Base tike...<br> - (Laughter)<br> ..call'st thou me host?<br> Now, by this hand,<br> I swear I scorn the title.<br> - Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.<br> - (Laughter)<br> No, by my troth, not long,<br> for we cannot lodge or board<br> a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen<br> that live honestly<br> by the prick of their needles<br> but it will be thought<br> we keep a bawdy house. Straight.<br> O hound of Crete,<br> thinks't thou my spouse to get?<br> I have, and I will hold, my honey queen.<br> And there's enough. Go to.<br> I would prick your guts a little,<br> and that's the truth of it.<br> O well-a-day, Lady!
