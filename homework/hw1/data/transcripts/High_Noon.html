I figured I had to stay.<br> - You figured wrong.<br> - I can deputise a posse, 10-12 guns.<br> - My intuition tells me otherwise.<br> - Why?<br> No time for a lesson in civics, my boy.<br> In the 5th century BC<br> the citizens of Athens,<br> having suffered under a tyrant,<br> managed to banish him.<br> When he returned years later<br> with an army of mercenary,<br> those same citizens<br> not only opened their gates for him,<br> but stood by while he executed<br> members of the League of Government.<br> Similar thing happened eight years ago<br> in a town called Indian Falls.<br> I escaped death only through the intercess on<br> of a lady of somewhat dubious reputation,<br> and the cost of a handsome ring<br> which once belonged to my mother.<br> Unfortunately, I have no more rings.<br> - You're a judge.<br> - Been a judge many times and many towns.<br> - I hope to live to be a judge again.<br> - I can't tell you what to do.<br> Why must you be so stupid? Have you forgotten<br> what he's done? That he's crazy?<br> Don't you rememher<br> when he sat there and said:<br> ''You'll never hang me. I'll come back<br> I swear it. I'll kill you, Kane!''<br> Here you are, ma'am.<br> This will take you to St. Louis.<br> Thank you.<br> Maybe you'd rather wait somewhere else.<br> Like at the hotel, maybe.<br> - All right thank you.<br> - I'm sorry about all this, Mrs Kane.<br> Don't you worry.<br> The marshal'll take care of himself.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Hey, that wasn't here five years ago.<br> - So what?<br> - Nothing...yet.<br> Harvey, don't you think<br> Kane will be looking for you right now?<br> - You're really sore at him.<br> - Wouldn't you be if you wore me?<br> I suppose...if I wore you.<br> I'll be back in a while.<br> -<br> - Goodbye, Will<br> - Goodbye.<br> - You think I'm letting you down?<br> - No.<br> Look, this is just a dirty little village<br> in the middle of nowhere.<br> Nothing that happens here<br> is really important. Get out.<br> There isn't time.<br> What a waste. Good luck.<br> Johnny!<br> - Why ain't you in church?<br> - Why ain't you?<br> Will you do somethin' for me?<br> Go find Anderson, Howe and Fuller,<br> and tell them I want them here.<br> - Then find Harv Pell!<br> - Don't have to do that. I'm right here.<br> - Where have you been?<br> - Busy.<br> You know what's doing?<br> We've got lots to do.<br> Hold up a second.<br> This ain't really your job, you know.<br> - That's what everybody keeps telling me.<br> - Just listen a second.<br> - All right, I'm listening.<br> - This is the way I see it.<br> If you'd gone with the new marshal<br> not due till tomorrow, I'd be in charge, right?<br> If I'm good enough to hold down the job<br> when there's trouble,<br> how come the city fathers<br> didn't trust me with it permanently?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Don't you?<br> - No.<br> - I figure you carry a lot of weight.<br> Maybe they didn't ask me.<br> Maybe they figured you were too young.<br> - You think I'm too young too?<br> - You sure act like it sometimes. Come on.<br> It's very simple, Will You just tell<br> the old boys that I'm the new marshal.<br> Tomorrow they can tell the other fellow<br> that the job's filled.<br> - You really mean it, don't you?<br> - Sure.<br> - But I can't do it.<br> - Why not?<br> - If you don't know, it's no use me tellin' you.<br> - You mean you won't do it?<br> - Have it your way.<br> - All right<br> The truth is, you probably<br> talked against me from the start.<br> You've been sore about me<br> and Helen Ramirez right along, ain't you?<br> You and Helen Ramirez? I...<br> I didn't know and it doesn't mean<br> anything to me, you ought to know that.<br> Yeah, you've been washed up<br> for more than a year.<br> You get married, only, you can't stand<br> anybody taking your place there...<br> - ...especially me.<br> - You're...<br> - I haven't got time, Harv.<br> - Okay, let's get down to business.<br> You want me to stick,<br> you put a word in for me.<br> Sure I want you to stick, but I'm not buying it.<br> It's gotta be up to you.<br> I thought you'd grown up by now.<br> I thought your disposition might've<br> sweetened up a little down in Abeline.<br> I guess we're both wrong.<br> What's so funny?<br> Did you really think<br> you could put that over on Kane?<br> - Why not?<br> - When are you going to grow up?<br> - I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.<br> - Then grow up.<br> Cut it out!<br> - All right<br> - Why should he have gone for it?<br> He needs me plenty<br> when Frank Miller gets here.<br> - That's possible.<br> - He should've had me made marshal.<br> - He's just sore. Sore about you and me.<br> - Is he?<br> Sure.<br> - You told him?<br> - Sure.<br> You're a fool.<br> Why? Didn't you want him to know?<br> Hey... Who did the walking out anyway,<br> you or him?<br> Get out, Harvey.<br> - I might just do that.<br> - Then do it!<br> - You don't mean that.<br> - Try me.<br> You're gonna talk different<br> when Frank gets here.<br> You might want somebody around,<br> when you try to explain about Kane.<br> - I can take care of myself.<br> - Sure.<br> I've heard that you might not be so pretty<br> when he gets through with you.<br> - I won't be back.<br> - Good.<br> -<br> Come in.<br> - I just saw Harvey. Is everything allright?<br> - I think I have to talk with Mr Weaver.<br> - You're getting out?<br> - Yes.<br> You want me to give Kane a hand?<br> - No.<br> - All right<br> May I wait here for the noon train?<br> I said, may I wait in the lobby until noon?<br> - Sure, lady.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're Mrs Kane, ain't you?<br> - Yes.<br> You're leaving on the noon train,<br> but your husband ain't.<br> - No, why?<br> - No reason, but it's mighty interesting.<br> Now me, I wouldn't leave this town at noon<br> for all the tea in China.<br> No, sir.<br> It's going to be quite a sight to see.<br> # My eyes have seen the glory<br> of the coming of the Lord<br> #He's trampling out the vintage<br> where the grapes of wrath are stored<br> # He has loosed the fruitful lightening<br> of His terrible swift sword<br> # His truth is marching home<br> # Glory, glory, halleluja<br> Glory, glory, halleluja<br> # Glory, glory<br> #Halleluja<br> His truth is marching home<br> # He has sonded forth the trumpet<br> that shall never call retreat<br> # He is shifting out the hearts of men<br> before His judgement seat<br> - Will, I just heard...<br> - Hello.<br> You can count on me,<br> you know that, don't you?<br> - I was figuring I could.<br> - You cleaned this town up.<br> You made it fit<br> for women and kids to live in.<br> Miller or nobody else'll never<br> drag it down again.<br> - I hoped people'd feel that way.<br> - What other way is there?<br> - How many men you got Lined up?<br> - None yet.<br> Well, you better get going, man.<br> I'll be back in 10 minutes.<br> - Where is he?<br> - He's coming up the back way. A careful man.<br> -<br> Come in, Mr Weaver. Hello.<br> Sit down, please.<br> Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramirez?<br> Why did you send for me?<br> I'm leaving town.<br> I want to sell the store.<br> - You want to buy me out?<br> - How much did you want?<br> Two thousand. I think that's fair.<br> It's fair allright, but<br> I couldn't raise that much now.<br> - How much can you raise?<br> - Oh... 1000 dollars.<br> All right you can pay Sam the rest<br> in six months.<br> - He'll get it to me. A deal?<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> All right, Mr Weaver. Thank you.<br> Mrs Ramirez, I want to<br> thank you for everything, I mean...<br> When you first put the deal to me<br> about staking me in the store,<br> and being a silent partner,<br> you know, my wife thought..<br> Err... What I really mean to say is that<br> you've been real decent to me right along,<br> and I want you to know<br> that I've been honest with you.<br> I know you have, MrWeaver.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye, Mrs Ramirez.<br> And good luck to you.<br> - Will..<br> - Amy. You've changed your mind.<br> I thought you'd changed yours.<br> No, Will, I have my ticket.<br> I see.<br> Clean number 19.<br> Mrs Miller is very particular.<br> - Is Helen Ramirez in?<br> - I guess so.<br> Think you can find it allright?<br> Come in.<br> What are you looking at?<br> You think I have changed?<br> What do you want?<br> You want me to help you?<br> You want me to ask Frank to let you go?<br> Beg for you?<br> I would not do it.<br> I would not lift a finger for you.<br> I came to tell you he was coming.<br> I should've figured you know about it.<br> I know about it.<br> You ought to get out of town<br> or I might not be able to...well..<br> - Anything can happen.<br> - I'm not afraid of him.<br> I know you're not<br> but you...you know how he is.<br> I know how he is.<br> Maybe he doesn't know.<br> - He's probably got letters.<br> - What about it?<br> Nothing in life is free.<br> I'm getting out. I'm packing now.<br> That's good.<br> -<br> - Goodbye, Helen.<br> - Kane...<br> If you're smart, you will get out, too.<br> - I can't.<br> - I know.<br> - May I ask you something?<br> - Sure.<br> - Who is Miss Ramirez?<br> - Mrs Ramirez?<br> She used to be a friend of your husband's<br> a while back.<br> Before that she was a friend of Frank Miller's.<br> I see. Thank you.<br> - You don't Like my husband, do you?<br> - No.<br> - Why?<br> - Lots of reasons.<br> This place was always busy<br> when Frank Miller was around.<br> I'm not the only one.<br> A plenty of people think<br> he's got a comeuppance coming.<br> You asked me, ma'am, so I'm telling you.<br> - I'll go and get some liquor.<br> - You have to have it?<br> - Yeah.<br> - If you're going after that...<br> - I said I was going for liquor.<br> - Keep away from Kane.<br> Sure.<br> -<br> Hello, Harv. Where's the tin star?<br> - I turned it in and quit.<br> - Smart move.<br> I didn't ask for your opinion.<br> Hey, Ben! How are you?<br> Hey, look who's here!<br> - How are you, Ben?<br> - Give me a bottle.<br> - It's been a long time, Ben.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yes, sir. How's Frank?<br> - He's not complaining.<br> - It'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, eh?<br> I wouldn't be surprised.<br> -<br> Kane's dead by minutes after<br> Frank gets off the train.<br> - It's not much time.<br> - That's all Frank'll need, because...<br> You carry a badge and a gun, marshal<br> You ain't no call to do that.<br> You're right<br> No.<br> I guess you all know why I am here.<br> I need deputies. I take all I can get.<br> You must be crazy comin' in here<br> to raise a posse.<br> Frank's got friends in this room.<br> You ought to know that.<br> Some of you wore special deputies when we<br> broke this bunch. I need you again...now.<br> Things wore different then.<br> You had six steady deputies to start off with.<br> Every one a top gun.<br> You ain't got but two now.<br> You ain't got two.<br> Harv Pell says he just quit. Why?<br> That's between the two of us.<br> You're asking an awful lot,<br> considering the kind of man Frank is.<br> All right<br> We all know what Miller's like.<br> That's why I'm here. How about it?<br> -<br> Mildred, he's coming.<br> Now you do like I told you.<br> I'm not home.<br> No matter what he says, I'm not home.<br> - Sam, he's your friend.<br> - Don't argue with me. He'll be here soon.<br> He won't believe me. He'll know I'm lying.<br> You do like I tell you.<br> -<br> - Hello, Mrs Fuller. Is Sam in?<br> - No, he isn't.<br> Do you know where he is?<br> It's important to me, to find him.<br> I think... He's in church, Will.<br> He's gone to church.<br> - Without you?<br> - I'm gonna go as soon as I dress.<br> Thank you, Mrs Fuller. Goodbye.<br> What do you want?<br> Do you want me to get killed?<br> - Do you want to be a widow?<br> - No, Sam. No.<br> Kane!<br> - What's the matter, Jimmy?<br> - Nothin'. I've been lookin' for you.<br> I wanna a gun. I wanna be with you<br> when that train comes in.<br> - Can...can you handle a gun?<br> - Sure I can. I used to be good.<br> Honest. It ain't just gettin' even.<br> It's a chance. This is what I need.<br> Please, let me get in on this.<br> All right, Jimmy.<br> I'll call you if I need you.<br> Get yourself a drink meanwhile.<br> -<br> Come in, Sam.<br> You're leavin' town?<br> - Where are you going?<br> - I don't know yet.<br> That doesn't make much sense.<br> - You're afraid, huh? Afraid of Miller.<br> - No.<br> Sure you are.<br> You wouldn't be runnin'.<br> You don't have to worry<br> as long as I'm around, you know that.<br> - I'll take Milleron any time.<br> - I believe you.<br> Then why are you goin'?<br> You're cuttin' out with Kane.<br> - Oh, Harvey...<br> - Why are you goin'?<br> - What difference does it make?<br> - I know it's Kane!<br> It isn't Kane. I'm going to tell you something<br> about you and your friend Kane.<br> You're a good-looking boy,<br> you have big broad shoulders.<br> But he is a man.<br> It takes more than broad shoulders<br> to make a man, Harvey,<br> and you have a long way to go.<br> You know something?<br> I don't think you'll ever make it.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> You're not goin' anywhere.<br> You're stayin' with me.<br> It's gonna be just like it was before.<br> You want to know why I'm leaving?<br> Then listen.<br> Kane will be dead in half an hour.<br> And nobody's going to do anything about it.<br> And when he dies, this town dies too.<br> I can feel it.<br> I'm all alone in the world,<br> I have to make a living.<br> So I'm going someplace else,<br> that's all.<br> And as for you, I don't like anybody to put<br> his hands on me unless I want him to.<br> And I don't like you to...anymore.<br> Our text today<br> is from Malachi, chapter four.<br> ''For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn<br> as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all..''<br> Yes?<br> I'm sorry, parson,<br> I don't want to disturb the services...<br> You already have. You don't<br> come to this church very often, marshal,<br> and today<br> you didn't see fit to be married here.<br> What can be so important<br> to bring you here now?<br> I need help.<br> It's true, I haven't been a churchgoing man,<br> and maybe that's a bad thing.<br> I didn't get married here today<br> because my wife is a Quaker,<br> but I came here for help<br> because there are people here.<br> I'm sorry, marshal<br> Say what you have to say.<br> Maybe some of you already know it<br> but if you don't...<br> It looks like Frank Miller<br> is coming back on a noon train.<br> I need all the specialdeputies I can get.<br> Well, what are we waiting for?<br> Let's go.<br> Hold it a minute, hold it!<br> Before we rush out into something<br> that isn't so pleasant,<br> let's make sure we know<br> what this is all about.<br> What I want to know is this: ain't it true<br> that Kane ain't no longer a marshal?<br> And that there's personal trouble<br> with Kane and Miller?<br> All right, allright!<br> Quiet, everybody!<br> If there's a difference of opinion,<br> let everybody have a say.<br> But let's do it like grown-up people,<br> and get the kids out of the building.<br> - Anything on the train?<br> - It's on time as far as I know, sir.<br> It don't really matter if there's anything<br> personal between Miller and Kane.<br> We all know who Miller is,<br> and what Miller is.<br> - We're wasting time.<br> - All right Coy!<br> We all know who Miller is<br> and we put him away once.<br> And who saved him from hanging?<br> The politicians up north.<br> I say, this is their mess.<br> Let them take care of it.<br> - Fryer?<br> - Well, I say this:<br> We've been paying good money<br> for a marshal and deputies.<br> The first time there's any trouble,<br> we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.<br> What have we been paying for<br> all this time?<br> We're not peace officers,<br> and this ain't our job!<br> I've been saying right along,<br> we ought to have more deputies.<br> If we did, we wouldn't be facing this now.<br> Just a minute, just a minute!<br> Everybody, quiet!<br> Keep it orderly.<br> You had your hand up.<br> I can't believe I've heard<br> some of the things said here.<br> You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.<br> We paid this man,<br> and he was the best marshal we ever had.<br> It ain't his trouble, it's ours.<br> If we don't do what's right,<br> we're gonna have more trouble.<br> There ain't but one thing to do,<br> and you all know what that is.<br> - Go ahead, Kibbee.<br> - This thing has been handled wrong.<br> Those three killers<br> walking the streets bold as brass...<br> Why didn't you put them in jail<br> where they ought to be?<br> Then we'd only have Miller to worry about.<br> I haven't anything to arrest them for.<br> They haven't done anything.<br> There's no law against them<br> sitting on a bench at the depot.<br> I can't listen to any more of this.<br> What's the matter with you people?<br> Remember when a decent woman<br> couldn't walk down the street in broad daylight?<br> When this wasn't a fit place<br> to bring up a child?<br> How can you sit and talk, and talk,<br> and talk like this?<br> What are we getting so excited about?<br> How do we know Miller's on that train?<br> We can be pretty sure he's on it.<br> Time's getting short.<br> - Parson, you got anything to say?<br> - I don't know.<br> The commandment says<br> ''thou shalt not kill''<br> but we hire men to do it for us.<br> The right and the wrong<br> seem pretty clear here,<br> but if I should tell my people<br> to go out and kill,<br> and maybe get themselves killed, I'm sorry,<br> I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.<br> All right, I'll say this.<br> What this town owes Will Kane, it can never<br> pay with money. Don't forget it.<br> He's the best marshal we've ever had,<br> and maybe the best we'll ever have.<br> So if Miller comes back here today,<br> it's our problem, not his.<br> It's our problem<br> because this is our town.<br> We made it with our own hands,<br> out of nothing.<br> If we want to keep it decent<br> we gotta think mighty clear today.<br> We gotta have the courage to do what is right,<br> no matter how hard it is.<br> All right! There's gonna be fighting<br> when Kane and Miller meet.<br> And somebody's going to get hurt,<br> that's for sure.<br> Now... People up north<br> are thinking about this town.<br> Thinking about sending money down here,<br> to put up stores and factories.<br> It would mean a lot to this town, an awful lot,<br> but if they'll read about shooting in the streets,<br> what are they going to think?<br> I'll tell you. They'll think<br> this is just another wide-open town,<br> and everything we worked for<br> will be wiped out.<br> In one day, this town<br> will be sat back five years,<br> and I don't think we can let that happen.<br> Mind you, you all know<br> how I feel about this man.<br> He's a mighty brave man, a good man.<br> He didn't have to come back today.<br> And for his sake, and a sake of this town,<br> I wish he hadn't.<br> Because if he's not here when Miller comes,<br> my hunch is,<br> there won't be any trouble, not one bit.<br> Tomorrow we'll have a new marshal<br> and if we offer him our services,<br> I think we can handle anything<br> that comes along.<br> To me that makes sense.<br> To me that's the only way out of this.<br> Will, I think you better go<br> while there's still time.<br> It's better for you and...it's better for us.<br> Thanks.<br> Why don't you put that thing away?<br> - Bang, bang, bang!<br> - You're dead, Kane.<br> I just sent the kid to find you.<br> Didn't he come?<br> He was here.<br> You've been my friend all my life.<br> You got me this job.<br> You made them send for me.<br> Ever since I was a kid<br> I wanted to be like you, Mart.<br> - You've been a law man all your life.<br> - Yeah, all my life. It's a great life.<br> You risk your skin catching killers,<br> and the juries turn them loose,<br> so they can come back<br> and shoot at you again.<br> If you're honest,<br> you're poor your whole life.<br> In the end you wind up dying all alone<br> on some dirty street.<br> For what?<br> For nothing. For a tin star.<br> The judge's left town, Harvey's quit,<br> and I'm having trouble getting deputies.<br> It figures. It's all happened too sudden.<br> People got to talk themselves into law and order<br> before they do anything.<br> Maybe because down deep they don't care.<br> They just don't care.<br> What'll I do, Mart?<br> I was hopin' you wouldn't come back<br> - You know why I came back<br> - But not to commit suicide.<br> Sometimes... Sometimes<br> prison changes a man.<br> Not him. This is all planned,<br> that's why they're all here.<br> Get out, Will! Get out.<br> Will you come down<br> to that depot with me?<br> No.<br> You know how I feel about you,<br> but I ain't goin' with you.<br> Seems like a man with busted knuckles<br> didn't need arthritis, don't it?<br> No, I couldn't do nothin' for you.<br> You'd get yourself killed<br> worryin' about me.<br> It's too one-sided like it is.<br> - So long, Martin.<br> - So long.<br> It's all for nothin', Will.<br> It's all for nothin'.<br> Excuse me, what is<br> Mrs Ramirez's room number?<br> - Three.<br> - Thank you.<br> Come in.<br> - Yes?<br> - Mrs Ramirez? I'm Mrs Kane.<br> I know.<br> - May I come in?<br> - If you like.<br> - Sit down, Mrs Kane.<br> - No, thank you.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Please...<br> I'm afraid that if I sat down,<br> I wouldn't be able to get up again.<br> - Why?<br> - It wasn't easy for me to come here.<br> - Why?<br> - Look, Mrs Ramirez...<br> Will and I were married an hour ago.<br> We were ready to leave...<br> ...then this thing happened<br> and he wouldn't go.<br> I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,<br> I just couldn't reach him.<br> - And now?<br> - That man downstairs, the clerk..<br> He said things about you and Will<br> I've tried to understand<br> why he wouldn't go with me,<br> and it's got to be because of you.<br> - What do you want from me?<br> - Let him go.<br> He still has a chance. Let him go.<br> - I can't help you.<br> - Please.<br> He isn't staying for me.<br> I haven't spoken to him for a year,<br> until today.<br> - I'm leaving on the same train you are.<br> - Then why is he staying?<br> If you don't know,<br> I can't explain it to you.<br> Thank you anyway.<br> You've been very kind.<br> What kind of woman are you?<br> How can you leave him like this?<br> Does the sound of guns<br> frighten you that much?<br> No, Mrs Ramirez. I've heard guns.<br> My father and my brother<br> were killed by guns.<br> They were on the right side, but that<br> didn't help them when the shooting started..<br> My brother was 19. I watched him die.<br> That's when I became a Quaker.<br> I don't care who's right or who's wrong.<br> There's got to be some better way<br> for people to live.<br> Will knows how I feel about it.<br> Just a minute.<br> Are you going to wait for the train downstairs?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why don't you wait here?<br> I've got no use for Kane,<br> but he's got guts.<br> You're mighty broadminded, Joe.<br> I always figured you had guts, but<br> I never gave you credit for brains until now.<br> What does that mean?<br> It takes a smart man<br> to know when to back away.<br> If I can't pick my company when I drink,<br> I ain't coming in here anymore.<br> Okay... All right<br> The boy with a tin star.<br> Put a saddle on him, Kane.<br> Go on, saddle him up.<br> He'd go a long way before he tires.<br> - You were thinking that.<br> - Kind of.<br> - You're scared?<br> - I guess so.<br> Sure. Stands to reason.<br> Come on. Let me help you.<br> Seems like everybody<br> wants to get me out of town.<br> Nobody wants to see you get killed.<br> - Where're you going?<br> - Back to the office, I guess.<br> Oh, no. You're getting on that horse<br> and getting out.<br> What's the matter with you?<br> You were ready to do it yourself.<br> Look, Harv. I thought about it<br> because I was tired.<br> You think about a lot of things<br> when you're tired. I can't do it.<br> - Why?<br> - I don't know.<br> Get on that horse, Will!<br> Why is this so important?<br> You don't care if I live or die.<br> - Come on.<br> - Don't shove me. I'm tired of being shoved.<br> I hate this town.<br> I've always hated it.<br> To be a Mexican woman<br> in a town Like this...<br> - I understand.<br> - You do?<br> That's good. I don't understand you,<br> no matter what you say.<br> If Kane was my man,<br> I'd never leave him. I'd get a gun.<br> - I'd fight<br> - Why don't you?<br> He's not my man. He's yours.<br> - You have some clean water?<br> - Why, sure, marshal sit down.<br> - Running some kind of trouble?<br> - No, not trouble.<br> -<br> - What're you building?<br> - Just fixing things.<br> Now, take it easy. Settle back, that's it.<br> Fred, Fred! Hold it awhile.<br> Stop 'til I tell you to start again.<br> - Thanks.<br> - You're welcome, marshal<br> - Oh, no...<br> - Tell your man he can go back to work now.<br> - Will!<br> - I guess I forgot about you, Herb.<br> - I'm sure glad you're here.<br> - Time's getting pretty short.<br> - Sure is.<br> - When are the other boys coming?<br> - We gotta make plans.<br> - The other boys?<br> There aren't any others<br> It's just you and me.<br> - You're joking.<br> - No, I couldn't get anybody.<br> I don't believe it!<br> This town ain't that low.<br> - I couldn't get anybody.<br> - Then it's just you and me.<br> - I guess so.<br> - You and me against all of them?<br> - That's right. Do you want out, Hern?<br> - Well..<br> It isn't that I want out, no. You see...<br> - I didn't figure on anything like this.<br> - Neither did I.<br> I volunteered, you know I did.<br> I was ready.<br> I...I'm ready now, but this ain't like<br> what you said it was gonna be.<br> This is just committing suicide.<br> I'm no law man.<br> I just live here.<br> I got nothing personal against nobody.<br> - I got no stake in this.<br> - I guess not.<br> There's a limit how much you can ask a man.<br> What about my kids?<br> Go on home to your kids, Herb.<br> You get some of the other fellows,<br> and I go through with it.<br> Go on home, Herb.<br> - What do you want?<br> - I found them, all but Mr Henderson.<br> - I found him. Thanks.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Marshal, let me fight with you.<br> I ain't afraid.<br> - No.<br> - Please, let me, marshal!<br> - You're a kid, you're a baby.<br> - I'm 16!<br> - I can handle a gun, too.<br> - You're 14. What do you wanna lie for?<br> I'm big for my ago. Please, marshal!<br> Well, you're big for your age,<br> but no, go on, get out of here.<br> -<br> -<br> -<br> -<br> Hey, Charlie. You can go home now.<br> Thanks, marshal!<br> Sure appreciate it. Certainly do.<br> You don't happen to know<br> if the saloon's open?<br> - I said, go home, Charlie.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - So long, Helen.<br> - Goodbye, Sam.<br> Take care.<br> -<br> -<br> - Hello, Frank.<br> - How are you, Frank?<br> - Everything ready?<br> - Just the way you wanted.<br> - We've got your gun over here.<br> - Let's get started then.<br> - Can't you wait?<br> - Just wanna be ready.<br> Miller!<br> -<br> -<br> -<br> -<br> Kane, come on out...or your friend<br> will get it the way Pierce did.<br> I'll come out, let her go.<br> As you soon as you walk through that door.<br> I'll hold my fire.<br> # Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'<br> # You made that promise when we wed<br> # Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'<br> # Although you''re grievin',<br> I can't be leavin'<br> # Until I shoot Frank Miller dead<br> # Wait along, wait along<br>
