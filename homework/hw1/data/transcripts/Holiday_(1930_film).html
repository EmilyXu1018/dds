Let's go<br> and give an interview.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Let's go.<br> Not there. Let's go this way.<br> 'Sir, it's often seen<br> that the Mumbai police..'<br> '..has been unable to capture<br> the terrorists behind the blasts.'<br> 'even if they capture them.'<br> instead of questioning him,<br> they are giving him vip treatment.<br> Let me assure you, I can<br> die for the people of this country.<br> He's blabbering as if<br> he is the one who caught him.<br> Actually, I should've been there.<br> But you dragged and brought me here.<br> Let me assure you, I won't rest<br> in peace till this case isn't solved.<br> If I would've been on TV..<br> First of all, my mother-in-law<br> would've been stunned.<br> I would've gained a lot of respect.<br> I would've become an inspector.<br> Very soon the will<br> be brought before the law.<br> 'Among those who died in the bus bomb<br> blast included women and children.'<br> 'according to the police, the terrorist<br> caught, Aseem Lala, is behind it.'<br> 'they also state that there can be other<br> terrorist organisations behind it.'<br> 'but this has still<br> not been confirmed.'<br> 'police state that the terrorists<br> behind it won't be spared.'<br> 'home ministry has recommended formation<br> of a high level investigation team.'<br> 'and also assured that the<br> security is being tighten up.'<br> 'those behind these attacks.'<br> Patil, I need someone<br> at the back-street.<br> Okay, Sir.<br> He is here.<br> What is it?<br> We were waiting for you.<br> Let's go.<br> Come inside.<br> This is Virat's house.<br> Do as you have been briefed.<br> Okay, Sir.<br> You are all on unofficial duty.<br> Set your walkies<br> to a different channel.<br> What is it, Makiya?

What happened?<br> That terrorist escaped<br> from the hospital.<br> What?<br> Yes.<br> He killed a doctor<br> and two of my cops.<br> But how?<br> I don't know.<br> In spite of so much security.<br> You got him arrested.<br> So he could come here and attack you.<br> That's why they are here.<br> Don't worry. Go to sleep.<br> I'll make a move.<br> Keep you!' Eyes open, guys!<br> Rocky..<br> Yes, Sir. I have sent<br> Tawde and Patil to gate no. 2.<br> I have never seen so much<br> security being given by police.<br> Hey!<br> Hurry up!<br> Catch him!<br> He must have gone straight ahead.<br> Suryavanshi, where are you?

We'll talk in the morning.<br> I want to talk to you now.<br> Come on the terrace.<br> I told you to leave.<br> We'll talk in the morning.<br> Leave.<br> Look, your friend's picture.<br> The one you helped escape<br> is a guest in my house.<br> Sorry I didn't tell you who I am.<br> My name is Virat.<br> Indian Army.<br> Not just that.<br> D.I.A.<br> Defence Intelligence Agency.<br> I am a specialist over there.<br> A secret agent with the army.<br> My friends who work with<br> me don't know about this.<br> Not even my family knows about this.<br> Why am I telling you all this?<br> I am sure this is what<br> you are thinking about.<br> It's because you won't live.<br> When we are at the border..<br> ...our enemy shoots<br> us and we shoot them.<br> This is what generally happens.<br> One day,<br> in our camp, a man named Ashraf..<br> He was from Sholapur.<br> He just disappeared suddenly.<br> Even after searching for seven days,<br> we couldn't find him.<br> We found him on the eighth day.<br> He was stuck at the enemy camp.<br> They tortured him for seven days.<br> They had gouged out his eyes.<br> They shoved a beer<br> bottle into his rare.<br> And then, they broke that bottle.<br> They were very cruel to him.<br> We had taken his<br> dead body to his house.<br> His mother was crying<br> and father was wailing.<br> His sister was screaming, yelling..<br> His family was in a very bad state.<br> But on the tenth day,<br> his younger brother<br> joined the military.<br> We die at the border even/day.<br> ...so that you can live<br> peacefully with your families.<br> This is a locally made gun.<br> This is my gun.<br> If I shoot you,<br> I'll have to tell<br> everyone why I did so.<br> Your family will express<br> their disgust over your dead body.<br> Your kids will beg at the signal.<br> Your wife will sell herself<br> on the streets at night.<br> And if you shoot yourself, it will<br> be considered as on-duty suicide.<br> Someone from your<br> family will get a job.<br> They will get the<br> provident fund money.<br> Pension will reach<br> home every month, on time.<br> Now you decide which<br> gun do you wish to pick.<br> And yes,<br> if the barrel of this gun points<br> towards me then I'll shoot you.<br> You are challenging<br> a very big threat.<br> A shot was fired.<br> The sound came from the terrace.<br> I think from over there.<br> From the terrace.<br> I know that you and the<br> ACP don't know everything.<br> Juhu, Bandra, Dharavi..<br> Dadar, Bombay Central.<br> blasts at 12 places in Mumbai.<br> When?<br> On 27th.<br> Time?<br> Looking beautiful?<br> Very beautiful.<br> Came from Jalandhar and<br> made a Maharashtrian fall for her.<br> - Really!<br> - She is very smart!<br> He is naive.<br> You're looking gorgeous.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Hi.<br> - Thank you so much.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Listen..<br> - Listen!<br> - What?<br> Come with me.

I have plans but..<br> Excuse me.<br> Can you please hold this? Let's go.<br> Congratulations.<br> What!<br> The college beauty<br> contest that I won..<br> You lost but you were<br> the second runner up.<br> Okay. Continue.<br> You have Hrithik, John and<br> Salman's posters in your hostel room.<br> So what?<br> Then why are you getting<br> married to this baldy?<br> Look, there are no<br> more than 10 film stars.<br> But there are 30<br> crores girls in India.<br> So think practically.<br> The good looking guys aren't smart<br> and the smart ones don't look good.<br> Listen..<br> And what about those who<br> are smart and good looking?<br> Beg, plead and get married to him.<br> Sorry!<br> Howzat!<br> What's troubling you, Makiya?<br> There's something<br> that I cannot understand.<br> Try me. I might be able to help.<br> In spite of being a cop,<br> I cannot understand.<br> How will you understand?<br> Why? I am a military man.<br> Do you know the basic difference<br> between a cop and a military man?<br> What?<br> As soon as someone<br> says Attention!..<br> A military man stands stiff,<br> like this.<br> When he gets shoot orders,<br> he starts firing without thinking.<br> But it's not so with us.<br> We need to use our brains.<br> I mean if we need to catch a<br> pickpocket, we need to think like one.<br> If we need to catch a murderer,<br> we need to think like one.<br> And if we need to catch a terrorist.<br> You need to think like one.<br> No, you sometimes need<br> to become a terrorist.<br> Oh, my God.<br> But in this case, even a<br> cop's brain has stopped working.<br> Then how can you help me?<br> Still, try me. I'll try to<br> solve this to be best of my ability.<br> Tell me. What's the problem?<br> Fine. It goes like this.<br> The terrorist escaped<br> from the hospital.<br> He did.<br> That very night a cop<br> committed suicide in his house.<br> That cop was posted at the hospital<br> from where the terrorist escaped.<br> Now these two incidents are related,<br> this is what a cop thinks.<br> Now tell me what<br> a military man thinks.<br> I think this isn't a suicide,<br> it's a murder.<br> How can you say that?<br> Because I committed this murder.<br> Why did you do it?<br> Why did he help that terrorist<br> escape from the hospital?<br> Escape from the hospital.<br> How do you know that?<br> The terrorist told me.<br> Where did you find the terrorist?<br> That day in the hospital, you..<br> What?<br> Hospital..<br> Hey!<br> Hi.<br> - What are you..<br> - Hi.<br> Can we talk...?<br> You don't..<br> Yes?<br> Can I marry you?<br> Marriage?<br> When did you get that idea?<br> This morning. 8:40am.<br> What happened at 8:40am?<br> My friend got married.<br> The most beautiful<br> girl in the college.<br> But the guy she is getting married<br> to is not at all good looking.<br> So, I asked her,<br> why is she getting married to him?<br> She said sometimes<br> some things don't match.<br> And you know how difficult<br> it is to find a good guy these days.<br> So my friends too advised me..<br> And I thought that<br> why won't we get married!<br> I hope you very well know<br> that from the very beginning..<br> ...nothing seems to<br> match between you and me.<br> First I rejected you<br> then you rejected me.<br> Now you are giving your consent.<br> I am just saying yes.<br> Yes, but nothing matches. Right?<br> Do you smoke cigarettes?<br> Smoking?<br> Yuck, I don't do all that.<br> Anyway, it's not allowed in boxing.<br> Saw? But I like girls who smoke.<br> I like the fragrance of tobacco.<br> Oh yes..<br> It's not like I have never done it.<br> Sometimes, you know, girls, parties..<br> It happens.<br> Nice. Nice.<br> Do you drink?<br> Drinks? Alcohol?<br> Yes, red wine.<br> You know, good for the head,<br> good for the skin.<br> Sometimes even vodka!<br> But I hate girls who drink.<br> I just cannot bear the<br> sight of girls drinking.<br> I can't understand why do they drink?<br> Why are you crying?<br> You are saying this on purpose.<br> On purpose?<br> I know that you love me.<br> Saiba..<br> Saiba, listen to me.

Look father!<br> Look mother, father..<br> Who did this?<br> We still don't know who did it<br> even the police have no clue.<br> Any clues?<br> Police has confiscated<br> all their things.<br> Just one non-tracker phone<br> has been taken by a shooter.<br> Whose phone was it?<br> Afsar Ali, who got killed<br> at Mumbai central, near the st stand.<br> I don't know who you are,<br> where you are.<br> You have killed 12 of my men.<br> One of them was my brother.<br> I am coming to you.<br> When I find you, I'll kill you.<br> I am waiting.<br> Hello. Please come.<br> What's the height of this wall?<br> Six feet.<br> They are excellent jumpers.<br> What was the speed of the bus?<br> Approximately 40km/hr.<br> They are good runners as well.<br> They can swim well too.<br> They have shot all the<br> A moving bus,<br> crowded market, dark theater..<br> Even from a distance of 20 meters they<br> shot at the center of the forehead.<br> They are trained shooters.<br> But they are not cops.<br> Was there anything<br> common in these 12 people?<br> No.<br> But there was one<br> thing common in them.<br> During inquiry I found out<br> that these 12 people were<br> wearing suits while shooting.<br> What did you just say?<br> These 12 people were<br> wearing suits while shooting.<br> This is something you<br> should have told me sooner.<br> I thought it's very<br> common to wear suits.<br> It's very common to wear<br> suits in America, but not in India.<br> So they are people<br> who wear suit-pants.<br> They can be waiters in a hotel.<br> Businessmen attending a board meeting.<br> They can be software<br> engineers attending a seminar.<br> Advocates, marriage functions.<br> I need a list of all the seminars..<br> ...and marriage functions that<br> took place in Mumbai on the 27th.<br> The ones with dress code suit-pants.<br> You think you are very smart.<br> Instead of killing those 12 people<br> if you would've caught them alive..<br> ...then we would've<br> got some information.<br> It's of no use.<br> Because they never<br> know what the plan is.<br> - What?<br> - Yes.<br> Those 12 people didn't<br> even know each other.<br> What are you saying!<br> These people are called Sleeper Cells.<br> Whether you call them<br> their heads or bosses..<br> Can be one, two or three..<br> They make the plan together.<br> And then they find people who<br> are ready to sacrifice their lives.<br> And the ones who are ready to sacrifice<br> their lives are called Sleeper Cells.<br> That's why it's no use capturing them.<br> Because they don't know anything.<br> So till these Sleeper<br> Cells don't get orders<br> from their boss they<br> lead a normal life?<br> Exactly.<br> We won't even know where they are.<br> It can be our neighbour.<br> Or the one sitting<br> next to us in a bus.<br> It can even be our courier boy.<br> It can be anyone.<br> So how do we destroy them?<br> There's one way to destroy them.<br> Kill their head or boss.<br> Once he is dead,<br> their connection shall end.<br> And as the Sleeper Cells won't get<br> any orders, they'll become dormant.<br> Just a minute! But how will you<br> find the head of the Sleeper Cells?<br> Who said I will find him?<br> He will find me.<br> What?<br> Because of what I have done.<br> - We killed 12 of his men..<br> - Yes.<br> He will surely attack<br> us to seek revenge.<br> According to my plan,<br> he will soon show himself.<br> But in a big city like Mumbai,<br> how will he find you?<br> We killed his men?<br> Right.<br> We must've made some mistake.<br> We must've left some clue behind.<br> He will come out to look for the clue.<br> If we find out what that clue is<br> we can capture him before he attacks.<br> Then get thinking<br> about what that clue is.<br> Move that colourful thing..<br> What is it called?<br> Cube?<br> Move the cube,<br> they will help you find out.<br> Right?<br> Because if you have<br> left a clue behind..<br> You won't answer this call.<br> No!
