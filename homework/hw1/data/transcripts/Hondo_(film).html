                        Hey, Mama. Mom! Look at that.<br> Look, Mommy, look.<br> Johnny!<br> Now you let Mommy do the talking.<br> Remember.<br> Yes, Mom.<br> But he has no horse.<br> No talking.<br> Good morning.<br> - You look like you've had trouble.<br> - Yep.<br> I lost my horse a few days ago<br> getting away from some Indians.<br> Indians?<br> We made dry camp last night<br> above the llano.<br> Sam here smelled more Apaches,<br> nuzzled me up.<br> So I thought I'd put some miles between us.<br> But why? We're at peace with the Apache.<br> - We have a treaty.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> Now I got to get me a new horse,<br> borrow or buy one.<br> I can pay you in United States script.<br> I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook.<br> - My name's Lane.<br> - I'm Mrs. Lowe.<br> I'm Johnny.<br> - The water sure looks inviting.<br> - Well, help yourself.<br> Watch out for that dog, son.<br> Could you hire me or sell me a horse,<br> Mrs. Lowe?<br> Of course. I've only got plow horses,<br> and two that are only half-broken.<br> The hand that was breaking them for me<br> got hurt and had to go to town.<br> - You mean you're staying here alone?<br> - Oh, no.<br> No, my husband is up in the hills...<br> - working some cattle.<br> - Oh.<br> He would pick today to be away,<br> when we have a visitor.<br> I'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am.<br> I wouldn't touch that dog, son.<br> He don't take to petting.<br> And now if you'll allow, ma'am,<br> I'll take a look at those horses.<br> Of course.<br> You'll find a saddle over by the barn.<br> In the meantime, I'll fix you something<br> to eat. I imagine you're hungry.<br> I could eat. Thank you.<br> I'm so sorry my husband had to pick today<br> to go hunting those lost calves.<br> He would have enjoyed<br> having a man to talk to.<br> We welcome visitors.<br> Must be right lonely around here.<br> Especially for a woman.<br> I don't mind. I was raised here.<br> - What can I feed your dog?<br> - Nothing, thanks.<br> He makes out by himself.<br> Can outrun any rabbit in the territory.<br> It's no trouble at all.<br> If you don't mind, ma'am,<br> I'd rather you didn't feed him.<br> I see. You don't want him to get in the habit<br> of taking food from anyone else.<br> Well, you can hand it to him.<br> No, ma'am, I don't feed him, either.<br> Sam's independent.<br> He doesn't need anybody.<br> I want him to stay that way.<br> It's a good way.<br> - Everyone needs someone.<br> - Yes, ma'am. Most everyone.<br> Too bad, isn't it?<br> - You're a good cook, ma'am.<br> - Thank you.<br> A woman should be a good cook.<br> Good cook myself.<br> Why didn't you get on him<br> when he was stuck?<br> 'Cause I didn't want him sitting on me<br> from a standing start.<br> Stay with him.<br> You chose the most savage one.<br> I won't give you an argument there.<br> He's always been a fighter.<br> I wouldn't give a plugged nickel<br> for a horse that wouldn't fight.<br> It lets you down when the going gets tough.<br> It's a little dull.<br> Well, I can do almost everything<br> around a ranch, but I never could...<br> put an edge on an axe.<br> Where is it?<br> - What?<br> - The grindstone.<br> This ranch looks like it's been here<br> a little while.<br> Yes, I was born here.<br> My husband was raised here, too.<br> He's an orphan. His parents got killed<br> in a wagon-train massacre...<br> so my father took him in.<br> - Handy.<br> - What do you mean?<br> Well, it seems the figures are against it.<br> Only young fellow in 1,000 square miles...<br> only young girl in 1,000 square miles.<br> They get in a whirl over each other.<br> That's what I meant. Handy.<br> I guess it was quite a coincidence.<br> But they say that the right two people are<br> going to meet by an arrangement of destiny.<br> You believe that, Mrs. Lowe?<br> - Yes, I do.<br> - Interesting.<br> Always sink a blade into a log, son.<br> Keeps the edge clean.<br> Well, I guess I'd better quit stalling<br> and get back to that horse.<br> And can I play with Sam now?<br> I've told you twice not to.<br> But you do what you wanna do.<br> Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew<br> the dog would bite, I should think...<br> Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit.<br> Youngster just learned.<br> Johnny.<br> Don't you ever touch that dog again!<br> Now go in and take your nap.<br> While I'm at it, I'll shoe those plow horses.<br> Thank you very much.<br> They do need a shoeing, I guess.<br> They do.<br> I guess my husband's having a hard time<br> finding those strayed calves.<br> I guess he is.<br> Perhaps he won't be home<br> until late tonight...<br> or he may even camp in the hills<br> and come in tomorrow after you're gone.<br> He'll be so sorry to have missed<br> one of our very few occasional visitors.<br> I guess I'll go and look after Johnny.<br> Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar.<br> - And an almighty poor liar.<br> - I don't understand you.<br> These horses haven't been shod<br> in a couple of months.<br> It's a cinch that axe hasn't had<br> an edge on it in two months.<br> And your tea can, a five-pound tea can<br> in your house is empty.<br> Your husband's been gone a long time.<br> Now, look here, Mr. Lane,<br> I don't think you have any right to...<br> I'm not talking about rights.<br> I'm talking about lies.<br> Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe?<br> Were you afraid that maybe you wouldn't be<br> safe here with me with your husband away?<br> - That it?<br> - That's partly it.<br> Women always figure every man<br> comes along wants them.<br> - Mr. Lane.<br> - Yes, ma'am?<br> You're right. I was lying.<br> My husband is overdue.<br> He should have been home long ago.<br> Figure Apaches killed him?<br> Of course not.<br> There are a hundred possible explanations.<br> Indians are one of them.<br> But we're at peace with the Apache,<br> except for a few...<br> Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense...<br> you'll pack up you and that boy of yours<br> and come out with me.<br> There's trouble brewing<br> in the Apache lodges.<br> Vittorio, their main chief,<br> called a war council.<br> A full report of it is in that dispatch<br> I'm carrying.<br> But you don't know, we've always<br> gotten along splendidly with the Apache.<br> They drink and bring their horses<br> to our spring...<br> on their way north to the buffalo hunt.<br> I've never seen the great Vittorio,<br> but there've been plenty of Apaches here.<br> I've seen the great Vittorio,<br> before the treaty.<br> His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane.<br> That was before the treaty.<br> We broke that treaty, us Whites.<br> There's no word in the Apache language<br> for lie, and they've been lied to.<br> If they rise, there won't be...<br> - a White left in the territory.<br> - They won't bother me.<br> Us, I mean. We always got along very well.<br> People I know, man and his wife,<br> got along real well for...<br> she upped and blew a hole in him...<br> big enough to drive a stagecoach through.<br> She got mad. The Apaches are mad.<br> Well, I have nothing to worry about,<br> I'm sure.<br> Nice to be sure.<br> Get out of the way.<br> - Strange dog you have.<br> - I don't have him.<br> - The two of you are together.<br> - He stays with me.<br> - He can smell an Indian at a half a mile.<br> - He smells Indians? I don't believe it.<br> Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians.<br> You can teach them.<br> Teach them? How?<br> First you get yourself a puppy and then...<br> you hire yourself a tame Indian<br> and cut a willow switch.<br> Then you get the Indian to beat the puppy...<br> with a willow switch four or five times<br> a day.<br> And when he grows up,<br> he'll always signal when he smells an Indian.<br> Beat a puppy. How cruel.<br> That's the way they do it.<br> Anyway, I don't believe<br> a dog can smell Indians.<br> I mean, as different from anyone else.<br> - You or me, for instance.<br> - Well, they can.<br> As a matter of fact,<br> Indians can smell White people.<br> - I don't believe it.<br> - Well, it's true.<br> I'm part Indian, and I can smell you<br> when I'm downwind of you.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe.<br> You baked today.<br> I can smell fresh bread on you.<br> Sometime today you cooked with salt pork.<br> Smell that on you, too.<br> You smell all over like soap.<br> You took a bath. And on top of that,<br> you smell all over like a woman.<br> I could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe,<br> and I'm only part Indian.<br> Mrs. Lowe.<br> What do you want?<br> - I watered and grained the stock.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'll bed down near here someplace tonight.<br> Mr. Lane?<br> You can't sleep outside,<br> there's a storm coming.<br> I've fixed a pallet for you in the corner.<br> It would be uncivilized<br> to let anyone sleep outside...<br> and after all, we are civilized, aren't we?<br> Speaking for you, of course. But me?<br> I guess you could call me civilized.<br> That's your bed.<br> I'm sorry it has to be on the floor.<br> I have to set the batter for the morning.<br> I hope the noise won't disturb you.<br> It won't.<br> Good night, ma'am.<br> Put that gun down.<br> You're Hondo Lane, the gunman.<br> - I carry a gun.<br> - Don't come any nearer.<br> You killed three men in a gunfight last year.<br> - We heard about it. Three men.<br> - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Just as quick as I could.<br> - Don't come any nearer.<br> It's not a very good idea<br> to point one of these things at anybody...<br> with an empty chamber under the firing pin.<br> You can see it plain as day.<br> I keep it that way because of Johnny.<br> Well, now it's loaded.<br> Keep it that way, and keep it high.<br> Please stay. I really want you to.<br> I'm sorry. I should have realized from<br> the beginning that you are a gentleman.<br> Civilized? Gentleman?<br> Well, a lot for one day.<br> Night, ma'am.<br> Morning. Getting an early start.<br> Be sure and tell that little man<br> goodbye for me.<br> I ought to wake him to say goodbye to you.<br> Was it me, I'd let him sleep.<br> Youngsters grow sleeping,<br> but you do what you want to.<br> He was so delighted with that whistle<br> you made for him.<br> Glad to hear it. He and I got along just fine.<br> It's more like a flute than a whistle.<br> It ranges almost the full scale.<br> I learned to make them when I was<br> living with the Mescalero.<br> My squaw used to make them<br> for every kid in the lodge.<br> - You lived with the Apache?<br> - Five years.<br> - And you had an Indian wife?<br> - Wife, squaw...<br> I took the liberty of borrowing a few feet<br> of rope off of that coil in the lean-to.<br> - Gladly pay you for it, if you let me.<br> - 'Course not.<br> The hills are so beautiful today.<br> Odd how clear they always are<br> after a dust storm.<br> Must have been very interesting<br> living with the Apache.<br> I liked it.<br> - This Indian wife you have...<br> - Had. She's dead.<br> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up<br> an unhappy memory.<br> I can't remember anything unhappy<br> about Destarte.<br> Destarte? How musical. What does it mean?<br> You can't say it except in Mescalero.<br> It means morning.<br> But that isn't what it means, either.<br> Means more than just that.<br> Indian words mean the sound and...<br> feel of a word, like...<br> crack of dawn, the first bronze light...<br> that makes the buttes stand out<br> against the gray desert.<br> The first sound you hear of a brook...<br> curling over some rocks, with trout jumping.<br> It's like when you get up in the first light...<br> just you and her and you go out of<br> a wickiup.<br> Where it smells kind of smoky and private,<br> just you and her, and...<br> kind of safe with just the two of you.<br> Stand outside and...<br> feel the bite of the first wind<br> coming down from the high divide...<br> that promises snowfall.<br> Can't say it in English,<br> but that was her name.<br> Destarte.<br> - You remind me of her some.<br> - Of an Indian girl?<br> Was she fair?<br> Her hair was black as 10 feet down.<br> Did you ever see a crow's wing,<br> how black and gleaming it is?<br> - Yes.<br> - That's the way her hair shined.<br> I'd like to pay you for that rope.<br> Riding dispatch,<br> I have the right to give U.S. script.<br> - You loved her?<br> - I don't know.<br> I needed her.<br> - But if she was dark and I'm fair...<br> - Why you reminded me of her?<br> - Yes.<br> - I don't know.<br> I thought about it.<br> You don't look anything like her.<br> I am fully aware<br> that I am a homely woman, Mr. Lane.<br> I didn't mean that.<br> I have a bad habit of telling the truth.<br> But being pretty isn't much.<br> I know a lot of pretty people<br> I wouldn't trust...<br> with a busted nickel-plated watch.<br> But some others, something comes out of<br> the inside of them and...<br> you know you can trust them.<br> Destarte had that.<br> And you've got it, too.<br> - I'm a married woman.<br> - I thought about that, too.<br> I guess I kissed you<br> because you remind me of Destarte.<br> Or maybe it was because<br> I hate to think of your hair...<br> hanging from the center pole<br> of an Apache wickiup.<br> Well, a long time ago I made me a rule.<br> I let people do what they want to do.<br> Sam!<br> You are a strange man, Mr. Lane.<br> I don't know about that.<br> Goodbye, Mrs. Lowe.<br> - You are Vittorio.<br> - I am Vittorio.<br> Your horses have been watered here.<br> - You were told to go.<br> - I couldn't leave.<br> My husband is away,<br> and I didn't think that I...<br> Your people water their horses here.<br> You leave my mother alone.<br> Stop him! Stop him!<br> - I ain't scared of you.<br> - You're not fear Apache?<br> No.<br> He fear hurt to mother, but not that to self.<br> He brave. Like Apache boy.<br> Him now blood brother.<br> I call him Small Warrior.<br> Him belong Moon Dog Lodge,<br> Chiricahua Apache.<br> You care for him well.<br> You now mother Chiricahua warrior.<br> Live safely here.<br> I hope someday,<br> someone befriends your sons.<br> My sons are dead. White man kill them.<br> Figured your scalp would be hanging<br> in some Apache wickiup by now.<br> - Hi, Buffalo.<br> - Been making bets on it.<br> - You're sure a disappointment to me, Hondo.<br> - You like to win your bet.<br> I wore out some horses.<br> You wore out you while you was at it.<br> Here, let me get that.<br> Where's that water?<br> - Looks like I won a bet, Buffalo.<br> - Hi, Dick.<br> Yeah, I owe you a jug of red-eye.<br> - This feels good.<br> - There's times when water is good.<br> That's exactly what I mean.<br> I say I got a right to talk to<br> this here bow-necked Major...<br> - I don't talk to no underlings.<br> - Major's asleep.<br> That's just too bad about him.<br> I'm a citizen and I want to see him.<br> Major ain't had any sleep for three days.<br> I can tell you everything<br> just as well as he can.<br> We ain't heard nothing from up north.<br> If you ask me, the Cavalry's scared of<br> Vittorio. I think the U.S. Cavalry...<br> I am greatly interested in your opinion of<br> the United States Cavalry.<br> Continue, Mr... Whatever your name is.<br> The Cavalry is supposed to support<br> the settlers.<br> I've got some cattle up north,<br> I don't intend...<br> C troop is making a sweep to the north<br> to escort out any settlers they may find.<br> C troop is now over a week late<br> in returning.

Ornery cuss.<br> Them indians you took that pennant offen.<br> - Dead Indians?<br> - Finally.<br> - Hi, Pete.<br> - Hi, Hondo.<br> Broke my heart when I heard you made it.<br> Your pap know you started out<br> against this so-called whiskey?<br> I ain't seen him for a month.<br> I know you haven't. Come here,<br> I got a message for you.<br> Leave him be, Hondo,<br> I can't make no money scouting.<br> Aw, these other fellows'll excuse you.<br> Come on over at the bar.<br> I won't.

His.<br> - It's very pretty, thank you.<br> He will ride well.<br> And he no afraid.<br> - I speak with your mother, go to house.<br> - Yes, Vittorio.<br> Lodge should have man.<br> - My husband will be home any day now.<br> - I no think so.<br> I think he dead.<br> Small Warrior should have father.<br> See, Sergeant, just like I told you.<br> That's my horse, all right.<br> Got my brand on it: "E.L." Ed Lowe.<br> What he says true?<br> - Yeah, that's his horse.<br> - Where'd you get him?<br> From his ranch,<br> that's where I'm taking him back.<br> That's where he can pick him up.<br> But that's Indian territory, strict orders<br> against any Whites going in there.<br> You know something, Joe, I got a bad ear.<br> I can't hear a thing you're saying.<br> Aren't you gonna prefer charges<br> against him?<br> He may be a mean, ornery,<br> son-of-anything-you-wanna-call-him...<br> but he ain't no horse thief.<br> And I'm not gonna call him one,<br> to his face or his back.<br> You stay here.<br> I thought the Apache were always silent.<br> Not when they seek squaw. You pick one.<br> What?<br> It's not good for Small Warrior...<br> to be without father<br> to teach him how to be man.<br> This is the one I was calling Emiliano.<br> Very brave, has taken many scalps.<br> He has six horses, and two squaws,<br> but one old and will soon die.<br> He's good hunter.<br> Never hungry, his wickiup.<br> This is one who is called Kloori.<br> He has ten horses, one squaw.<br> Sachito, brave warrior, many horses.<br> Not much beat squaws, sings very loud.<br> - Boy, go stand by my horse.<br> - Yes, Vittorio.<br> Small Warrior never to see tears,<br> Apache does not weep.<br> Chief, you can't make me do this,<br> I'm married.<br> You are fool, your man dead.<br> Soon come planting rain.<br> If your man come home by then, good.<br> If not, you take Apache brave.<br> Remember, time of planting rain.<br> He's getting kind of deep<br> into Indian territory.<br> And so are we.<br> What are you squawking for?<br> You're getting well paid.<br> He'll be making camp pretty soon. Don't<br> get a chance at him then, we'll turn back.<br> Quiet, Sam, I hear them.<br> Come on, Sam.<br> That's his camp, all right.<br> Rifle's gone,<br> must be out looking for camp meat.<br> - You're all right, you're not hurt bad.<br> - This tintype saved me.<br> That did it.<br> Now, every Apache between us<br> and the ranch will be alerted.<br> They'll have us cut off.<br> No, there's nobody between us<br> and Fort Seddon.<br> Beat it, Sam!<br> - White man understand Apache.<br> - A little.<br> He know now how he die.<br> Your coup stick shows many scalps.<br> Yes, many.

Soldier hat.<br> - I was once a soldier.<br> Why you here Apache land?<br> This is for me to know.<br> I'm told you speak insults<br> to this one of my chiefs.<br> The cougar screams insults and is brave.<br> A coyote howls insults and is a coward.<br> We shall see.<br> Cougar or coyote.<br> You will die bravely in silence...<br> or you will wail<br> like woman bringing forth child...<br> and cry out to us where pony-soldiers are.<br> He claims the blood right, you understand?<br> You mean, he says I shot his brother?<br> I understand.<br> So that life may ebb cleanly.<br> Forget your blood right or join your brother.<br> You think you buy your life now?<br> I don't think.<br> You may live or die, we see.<br> Indians.<br> Is this your man?<br> Speak, is this your man?<br> - Yes, this is my husband.<br> - White man...<br> you lived with the Apache, that's good.<br> You know how Small Warrior<br> should be taught that...<br> he be honored son of wickiup<br> of one who's called Vittorio.<br> Watch like the hawk,<br> be patient as the beaver...<br> brave as puma, that he may learn well.<br> Know it, then...<br> or your dying will be long before<br> you welcome death.<br> - More coffee?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - Gonna fix up your shirt.<br> Not before I show you something.<br> - Did Ed give you this?<br> - I took it off his body.<br> He's dead.<br> Tried to tell you before.<br> Funny, I'm not surprised.<br> Perhaps because I knew all along,<br> just wouldn't admit it to myself.<br> - Hi, Emberato, you didn't die, did you?<br> - Hello, Johnny.<br> Be careful.<br> I wanna show you something, Emberato.<br> My Indian emblem.<br> Vittorio gave it to me, didn't he, Mom?<br> - He's taken a great liking to Johnny.<br> - Probably saved your life and mine.<br> Indians place great value on male children.<br> They also place a great value on dying well.<br> Did Ed die well?<br> I keep it under my pillow.<br> He died well.<br> When Johnny's old enough,<br> when he has to be told...<br> it will make him proud.<br> Here it is, Emberato. I'm a chief now.<br> Isn't it wonderful?<br> - Isn't it?<br> - Yes, Johnny.<br> - Where's your mother?<br> - Picking watercress.<br> - Any luck?<br> - Not a bite this morning.<br> See where the sun is?<br> - Up there.<br> - Yeah, on the back of your neck.<br> You're casting a shadow.<br> If you can see it, the fish can see it.<br> Always fish with the sun in your face.<br> The other bank's the place.<br> - That is, if you want my opinion.<br> - Gosh, Emberato, I want your opinion.<br> But Mama won't let me go over there.<br> - Why not?<br> - I can't swim.<br> - You can't what?<br> - I can't swim.<br> - How old are you?<br> - Six.<br> - Help him, he can't swim.<br> - Time he learned. Everybody should swim.<br> Just reach out in front of you<br> and grab a handful of water.<br> Pull it back towards you.<br> Not too fast. That's the way I learned.<br> - I did it, Emberato, I did it.<br> - Good.<br> - How will he get back?<br> - Swim.<br> Well, he might drown.<br> - Well, then, you go get him.<br> - I can't swim, either.<br> Angie, there's...<br> something I've got to tell you.<br> I tried to tell you.<br> - And it isn't going to be easy.<br> - Then don't say it yet.<br> Just look at the moon.<br> How odd it looks in this quarter.<br> When I was a child, my mother<br> used to tell me it was a teeter-totter.<br> You know, the tilted plank a child plays on.<br> I suppose the Indians have a word for it.<br> Yeah, bermarga. It's the planting moon.<br> Indians won't plant their corn<br> unless the moon's like that.<br> You liked living with the Apache, didn't you?<br> Angie, I've just got to tell you this.<br> I'm not much for lying.<br> The last time I was here,<br> before Vittorio brought me?<br> Yes.<br> I rode dispatch some after that,<br> then came to Seddon.<br> There was trouble.<br> I killed a man.<br> Stay still. Somebody in those willows.<br> Don't shoot, White man.<br> Small Warrior has knife. He sleeps with it.<br> - You were in the house?<br> - In house.<br> Wickiup empty place without sons.<br> Mine empty wickiup.<br> You better tell that brave back at<br> the creek bank not to walk in the water.<br> I almost killed him a few minutes ago.<br> Almost threw a shot at him.<br> He very young. Will learn.<br> - lf he lives.<br> - You are Apache.<br> Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near.<br> Soon will be fought remembered fight.<br> They will come here first.<br> - You will not go with them, White man.<br> - I will not.<br> Leader of pony-soldiers will question you.<br> You will say you have seen Apache<br> trailing to the west.<br> This I won't do.<br> - You will not?<br> - I will not.<br> You have good man, treasure him.<br> They're mounting up now<br> down by the butte.<br> I don't hear a thing.<br> There's eight of them I'd say,<br> or maybe nine.<br> - There's something in those trees.<br> - That's a squirrel. Our talking woke him up.<br> He's put out. There's nine of them.<br> I love you.<br> I suppose I shouldn't have said that...<br> with my husband dead so short a time.<br> I don't guess people's hearts<br> got anything to do with a calendar.<br> You were so wonderful,<br> refusing to lie for Vittorio.<br> He was testing me. Indians hate lies.<br> And I guess I got to feel the same way...<br> but, once in a while a fella's got to...<br> lie if it'll make it easier on someone else.<br> Troop, halt!<br> Prepare to dismount.<br> Dismount!<br> Madam and sir, may I present myself?<br> Lt. McKay, Troop D, 8th cavalry.<br> - Hi, Hondo, you old cabin robber.<br> - Hi, Buff.<br> Lieutenant, this here is Hondo Lane.<br> He's scouted some<br> and ridden dispatch some for the cavalry.<br> - I don't reckon I know this here lady.<br> - This is Ms. Lowe, Lieutenant.<br> You people are lucky. Obviously, Vittorio...<br> and his renegade band<br> just happened not to find this hidden valley.<br> - Vittorio's been here lots.<br> - And you lived?<br> One lone man stood off Vittorio?<br> No lone man stands off the Apache.<br> He lets us live here.<br> There are almost 100 dead settlers<br> in the basin...<br> scalped by this cowardly criminal.<br> Vittorio may be a criminal by the books,<br> I don't know.<br> But if he's a coward,<br> it hasn't showed up yet.<br> - Amen, brother.<br> - I must disagree with you, Mr. Lane.<br> He's run before us for 200 miles.<br> Indians have a story<br> they tell their young ones...<br> about a hunter who chased a wild cat<br> until he caught it.<br> Then it was the other way around.<br> The story goes back further than<br> the Indians.<br> It's originally attributed<br> to the first Roman army to enter Tartary.<br> The soldier caught a Tartar and yelled out.<br> The officer called back for him to come in<br> with his prisoner.<br> And he replied, "The Tartar won't let me."<br> That was one of the favorite stories<br> of Col. Mays...<br> who teaches cavalry tactics at the Point.<br> The story is world-wide.<br> How long have you been out of that school,<br> Lieutenant?<br> Graduated class '69, sir.<br> This is '70, ain't it?<br> I just can't seem to keep up with the years.<br> I meant to get a calendar, but then I forget.<br> Say, who's President<br> of these United States now?<br> Ulysses S. Grant.<br> You know, I voted once. I was down<br> in Independence around voting time.<br> And a fellow come up to me and offered me<br> $2 if I'd vote for a man named Taylor.<br> And I was drinking...<br> drinking a little at the time. And I...<br> The $2 didn't last...<br> Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Lane, my orders are<br> to make a sweep as far as Twin Buttes.<br> My men'll bivouac here tonight.<br> We'll go on to Twin Buttes tomorrow...<br> return tomorrow night to escort you<br> and your boy out to safety.<br> If you'll excuse me, madam, I must<br> see that my men are properly encamped.<br> Very nice and very young.<br> He for doggone sure is, ma'am.<br> - How long you been out on this patrol?<br> - This is the 20th day.<br> We've rounded up about eight families<br> back there, that's all there are left.<br> We're gonna pick them up on the way out.<br> There've been many a scalp took, Hondo.<br> - You know where Vittorio is, don't you?<br> - I do.<br> This boy Lieutenant's gonna get you killed.<br> Us scouts has got to get<br> these young officers educated.<br> Johnny, go in and set out the plates for me.<br> Hondo, if your friend<br> would like to eat with us, Mr...<br> Buffalo? Mr...<br> I've known you for 8 or 10 years.<br> You must have a last name.<br> Well, of course I got a last name,<br> what do you think I am?<br> I know what you are,<br> but there's a lady present.<br> Mrs. Lowe, my name is Baker.<br> That's what it is, Buffalo Baker.<br> Well, you may eat with us then, Mr. Baker,<br> and wash.<br> There's a basin on the bench<br> and a towel on the jug, and soap.<br> You know, there is something<br> about this place...<br> - I know what it reminds me of.<br> - My ranch.<br> In California.<br> I shot a deer right off your front porch<br> on a butte just like that.<br> With a crick down below<br> and the mesas all spreading out.<br> Made me pack it back.<br> - You have a place that looks like this?<br> - East of San Dimas.<br> How wonderful.<br> You're getting to where you kind of<br> take to that water.<br> Every time I wash my face...<br> I think of you and that night at Seddon's,<br> when you whacked me.<br> You busted off a jaw tooth, and it got to<br> hurting so bad I had to go to...<br> the barber and have him dig out<br> the rest of it.<br> Did I catch you that day,<br> I'd have set your sun.<br> That's the last morning you'd ever seen.<br> "Hondo Lane, first prize, Winchester Arms."<br> Always liked this rifle of yours.<br> Always wanted one of the new issue myself.<br> Keep your hands off it.<br> I've known him 10 years, and he's never<br> spoken a friendly word to me.<br> - I don't like you.<br> - Figured that.<br> But now I figure is how he might admire<br> to give me that rifle.<br> You see, about a half day out of Seddon,<br> I come across some bodies.<br> One of them was this here lady's husband.<br> There was a lot of horse tracks<br> around there.<br> Some of them belonged<br> to that there chestnut you were riding.<br> That one with the cast-off horseshoe.<br> Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice<br> little set-up you got yourself here.<br> Nice ranch. Pretty woman.<br> You could get yourself killed talking like this.<br> Or I could get that<br> new-fashioned Winchester...<br> since he bushwhacked this lady's husband.<br> Did she know that,<br> I figure she wouldn't look at him like...<br> he was the high cockalorum of every tribe<br> from here to Salt Water.<br> Hondo.<br> I tried to tell you.<br> Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave.<br> Mr. Lane?<br> - Stridon.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Form the troops, column of twos.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I want you to accompany us<br> as far as Twin Buttes.<br> Haven't any time to lose,<br> so I'd be obliged if you'd saddle up.<br> - I'm not going.<br> - You're not going?<br> - That's right.<br> - But why?<br> - Gave my word.<br> - Your word to whom?<br> - Vittorio.<br> - Surely a word given to an...<br> - Indian desperado wouldn't be...<br> - Mister, when I give my word, I keep it.<br> Now I'll give you a piece of advice...<br> there's only one family<br> between here and Twin Buttes...<br> and you're too late to do them any good.<br> So you better gather up what settlers<br> you have and hightail it out of here.<br> Sir, I have my orders,<br> and these orders will be executed.<br> Ma'am.<br> Prepare to mount.<br> Mount.<br> Forward...<br> ho!<br> - Angie.<br> - I can't talk now. I have to think.<br> I'll put your things outside.<br> - Before I go I want to explain something.<br> - Yes?<br> It didn't happen in the low way you heard it.<br> - I didn't bushwhack.<br> - I never for a moment thought you did.<br> - But you killed him.<br> - I didn't have any choice...<br> - he cut loose at me...<br> - I should have known that.<br> I should have known you were lying<br> to make me think well of him.<br> Poor Ed. I guess he wasn't the sort of man<br> to die well.<br> Sorry now I hated him so much.<br> I guess he couldn't help<br> being weak and selfish.<br> - I just didn't have any choice.<br> - I know that.<br> You're gonna feel differently about me?<br> No one has any control<br> over the way they feel.<br> I'm never going to change<br> the way I feel about you.<br> But...<br> what about him?<br> Yeah.<br> Guess there are some things<br> that just can't...<br> He's gonna be a good man.<br> Good spread to his shoulders.<br> Head works, too.<br> Other night, after you went to sleep,<br> he crawled up into my bunk...<br> and put his arms around my neck.<br> Made me feel kind of funny.<br> Like he was depending on me.<br> Lot of things I'd rather do than this.<br> You're going to tell him?<br> If I don't, somebody else will.<br> And I got a belly full of lies.<br> Look what I got!<br> - Hold him by the gills like I showed you.<br> - Sure.<br> - Johnny, I want to tell you something.<br> - It's a nice perch, ain't it?<br> Bass. Remember the shape of its head?<br> Oh yeah, I forgot.<br> Bass have a jaw that stick out like this.<br> What I wanted to tell you is...<br> while back, a man came at me with a gun.<br> - I had to kill him.<br> - Good. Indian?<br> No, he was a white man, Johnny,<br> but I didn't have any choice. He...<br> I told you to press down on the shank,<br> and then you won't stick yourself.<br> Won't break the hook, either.<br> Here, bite down on this stick.<br> That's the way Indian youngsters...<br> learn not to cry.<br> - Johnny, this man I killed...<br> - No!<br> Your ranch in California,<br> it's far, too far for gossip to travel.<br> Go wrap your thumb<br> in some bayberry leaves.<br> You and your silly ideals.<br> You think truth is the most important thing.<br> - It's the measure of a man.<br> - Not for a woman.<br> A man can afford to have noble sentiments<br> and poses.<br> But a woman only has the man she marries.<br> That's her truth.<br> And if he's no good, that's still her truth.<br> I married a man who was a liar,<br> a thief, and a coward.<br> He was a drunkard and unfaithful.<br> He only married me to get this ranch, and<br> then he deserted Johnny and me for good.<br> And that's your fine truth for you.<br> - Could I bring Johnny up on that?<br> - No, I guess you couldn't.<br> And then you come along<br> and you're good and fine...<br> and everything that Ed<br> could never hope to be.<br> And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil<br> Johnny's chances, and mine?<br> - Varlebena.<br> - What?<br> When the Indians wind up their<br> squaw-seeking ceremony...<br> they only say one word: Varlebena.<br> It means forever.<br> Forever.<br> Well, we caught the wild cat.<br> Give us a hand, will you?<br> I can't understand,<br> we killed him on the last charge.<br> Vittorio?<br> They had us surrounded.<br> Could've cut us to pieces,<br> then they withdrew.<br> That's why they pulled out.<br> Anytime their leader is killed...<br> that means their medicine's bad.<br> - This poor child.<br> - We're going out with this troop.<br> - Vittorio's dead.<br> - No, he can't be.<br> Everybody gets dead, it was his turn.<br> Now get your possibles.<br> I have some medicine in the cabin.<br> Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be...<br> eternally grateful<br> if you'd pass among the men first.<br> No, you're wounded,<br> I'm going to fix you up.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> The men are in worse shape than I am.<br> Come on, do as he says.<br> We'll take care of him.<br> - Sergeant.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> Dismount the men.<br> - Hitch their horses up to the wagon.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You'll find harness in the barn.<br> Len.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Take four men and gather the settlers.<br> We'll probably catch up with you<br> at Errad Crossing.<br> Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson.<br> - How is he?<br> - He'll make out.<br> Don't know much. Led us into an ambush.<br> But I ain't ashamed of him nohow.<br> Bullet holes are in the front of him.<br> All those youngsters from the Point<br> are like that.<br> They got to learn.<br> Partly they learn, partly they die.<br> But I gotta float my stick same as you.<br> I never saw one of them<br> I had to be ashamed of.<br> Join in and keep moving.<br> Move it along, there!<br> Hurry up!<br> Come on, move along here!<br> Come on, hurry it up.<br> Circle the wagons!<br> Wheel her around.<br> Hold on!<br> Stay in the wagon.<br> Keep everybody in the wagons.<br> And don't unhitch.<br> Hondo!<br> All this circle's doing is protect the horses.<br> We gotta turn some wagons over.<br> And stay here? That's what they expect.<br> We gotta do what they don't expect.<br> That's why all the heavy artillery's<br> in Buffalo's wagon.<br> Buffalo!<br> Lieutenant, get down. Are you ready, Buff?<br> - I was born ready.<br> - Let's go.<br> Circle the wagons.<br> Close up.<br> Stay down!<br> Sergeant!<br> - I don't want to be an Apache, Mama.<br> - Now, you be quiet.<br> We're going to get out all right.<br> Now, help me, hurry.<br> - Ready again, Buff?<br> - As I told you, I was born ready.<br> Throw me your knife.<br> Get out of here!<br> All right, Hondo!<br> They're not following.<br> Leader's dead.<br> They'll powwow and pick a new one.<br> - We're out of trouble if we get a move on.<br> - And am I going to get to drive?<br> Before we get to San Dimas,<br> you'll be a top teamster, son.<br> - How are you, Lieutenant?<br> - Fine, thanks to you.<br> And you're all right, thanks to Lennie.<br> He shot that Indian offen your back.<br> - Thanks.<br> - With your rifle.<br> It's his.<br> Don't look like we'll be needing it<br> much more today.<br> General Crook will be here<br> within a month with a large force.<br> - That'll be the end of the Apache.<br> - Yeah.<br> End of a way of life.<br> Too bad, it's a good way.<br> Wagons forward!<br>
