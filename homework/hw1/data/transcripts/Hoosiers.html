                        Excuse me. Where is<br> Cletus Summers' office?<br> - Up the stairs.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're not the new coach?<br> - Were you expecting someone different?<br> - Younger, I guess.<br> - Sorry to disappoint you.<br> Cletus said he was hiring someone who<br> never coached high school before, so I...<br> I coached in college.<br> And I hear you're our new history<br> and civics teacher as well.<br> - That's part of the job, as I understand it.<br> - Have any experience teaching?<br> Tell me something.<br> Am I being interviewed here?<br> - I thought I already had the job.<br> - Straight up.<br> If everyone is as nice as you, country<br> hospitality is gonna get an awful name.<br> What a pleasant thing to say.<br> Cletus?<br> - What are you doing down there?<br> - Floatin'.<br> Norman Dale?<br> I hardly recognised you.<br> It's been 20 years.<br> Buffalo State Teachers College,<br> spring of '31.<br> I had a hell of a time tracking you down.<br> I didn't know you were still in the service.<br> I'm here now.<br> You really made good time.<br> Wasn't it just yesterday or the day before<br> that we settled this thing?<br> Well, you said practice started last week.<br> I figured I'd get here as soon as I could.<br> It's been a while for you.<br> - Yeah. I appreciate what you're doing...<br> - Let's not be repeating ourselves.<br> Your slate's clean here.<br> We got a job to do.<br> So come on, Coach,<br> let me show you around.<br> This is where it all happens. Not exactly<br> what you're used to, but we're proud of it.<br> During the season we put<br> 800 people in here every Friday night.<br> - When does practice start?<br> - Well, we'll practise at noon this week,<br> cos some of the boys have got to<br> get ready for threshin' on Saturday.<br> Jimmy, I want you to meet someone.<br> - This is Norman Dale, our new coach.<br> - Hi.<br> - Real friendly town you got here.<br> - It can be.<br> Let's go on back out to the farm.<br> I got a place fixed up out there for you.<br> Get you squared away.<br> That's it. Thank you.<br> - Say hello to Chester.<br> - Hello, Chester.<br> Say goodbye to Chester.<br> So you say this kid Jimmy wouldn't<br> play basketball after the coach died?<br> Well, the coach was<br> kind of like an old man to him.<br> Kid never had any family<br> of his own to speak of.<br> At least he comes on down to the school<br> and shoots them buckets.<br> Aside from that, he's just about<br> backed away from everything.<br> I don't know why you're going on so<br> about this kid being irreplaceable.<br> It's my experience<br> that nobody's irreplaceable.<br> Well, I think there's something<br> you don't understand.<br> Oh?<br> In over 40 years of looking<br> at the best this state's ever had,<br> I've never seen a better ball player<br> than Jimmy Chitwood. Never.<br> I'm glad you're here, Norm.<br> I think it's gonna work out.<br> Well, it's gotta work out this time<br> or that's it for good.<br> The last time you coached<br> was 12 years ago?<br> - Yeah, that's right.<br> - Where?<br> That was in Ithaca, New York.<br> What you been doing since?<br> Well, I've been in the navy for the last<br> ten years. I was a chief petty officer.<br> Well, uh...<br> looks like you're gonna need a little help.<br> I've been running practices<br> the last couple of weeks.<br> I'll help you out till you get your feet wet.<br> This town doesn't like change,<br> so we thought we'd get together<br> and show you how we do things here.<br> We trust that you're a fine,<br> upstanding, God-fearing man<br> with Christian morals and principles<br> who will set an example and<br> a standard of leadership for our boys.<br> Tell me, do you believe in<br> man-to-man or zone defence?<br> Zone defence is all we've played, and<br> it's the only thing that'll work this year.<br> That's right, George.<br> For anything else our boys<br> are too small but, remember,<br> we were 15 and 10 last year,<br> and we got all our boys back but one.<br> Listen, I ain't interested in talking defence<br> and I don't have a hair of a notion<br> why we hired someone who's been<br> in the water for the last ten years.<br> The main point is we don't get Jimmy<br> Chitwood back, we don't have a prayer.<br> He switches over to Terhune,<br> we're in big trouble.<br> - He's right, Coach. Jimmy's...<br> - Gentlemen.<br> It's been real nice talking to you.<br> Good night.<br> Miss Fleener?<br> Good morning.<br> I heard the boys weren't<br> real generous with you last night.<br> I keep forgetting there are<br> only 50 people in this town.<br> - This hick town, you mean?<br> - I didn't say that.<br> That's what you're thinking, isn't it?<br> I thought we were gonna be friends.<br> - I guess you'll wanna talk about Jimmy.<br> - Why would I?<br> You've been told<br> you can't win without him?<br> Too many times in the last 24 hours.<br> What's it to do with you?<br> I look after him. His mother's sick, his<br> father passed away and we're neighbours.<br> He and I decided<br> it's best for him not to play...<br> - Fine.<br> - You hear me? He's not gonna play.<br> That's fine.<br> - You'll be convinced to go after him.<br> - If I am, you will be the first to know, OK?<br> Good morning. Good morning.<br> Come on, outside.<br> Quit throwing the ball around and shoot it!<br> Move it! That's the shot. Outside.<br> Get on the board! Good shot.<br> Gimme two. Gimme two outside. Get it up<br> there. You can't score if you don't shoot!<br> Shoot from outside!<br> Quit throwing it around! Get it in the hole!<br> Oh, there you are. I thought we'd go<br> 20 minutes on, 10 off and 20 on.<br> I had a different schedule in mind.<br> Look, mister, these boys<br> got a routine they're used to.<br> You throw a new coach with newfangled<br> ideas at 'em, might get 'em all confused.<br> We'll ease into it real slow.<br> Hell, our first game's<br> less than two weeks away.<br> First of all, let's be real friendly here, OK?<br> My name is Norm.<br> Secondly, your coaching days are over.<br> Look, mister, there's... two kinds of dumb.<br> A guy that gets naked and runs out in the<br> snow and barks at the moon, and, uh...<br> a guy who does the same thing<br> in my living room.<br> The first one don't matter, the second one<br> you're kinda forced to deal with.<br> Translate.<br> That some sort of threat?<br> I don't know why Cletus<br> dragged your old bones in here.<br> He must have owed you something fierce.<br> The fact is, mister,<br> you start screwing up this team,<br> I'll personally hide-strap your ass to a<br> pine rail and send you up the Monon line.<br> Leave the ball, will you, George?<br> Thank you.<br> Huddle up.<br> Let's see what kind of hand<br> I've been dealt here.<br> Seven players, is that it?<br> Six, cos I don't really count.<br> Why is that?<br> I'm too short and I'm not no good.<br> I suit up for practice to be a body.<br> Equipment managing's my trade.<br> I thought everybody in Indiana<br> played basketball.<br> Most do, but not all go out for the team.<br> We only got 64 boys in the whole school.<br> It's gonna be a lonely bench. Those of you<br> who don't know, my name's Norman Dale.<br> I coached college ball for 10 years,<br> but it's 12 years since I've blown this.<br> I'm gonna be learning from you<br> just like you learn from me.<br> I'm gonna set up practice<br> a little differently.<br> But, as you'll find out,<br> everything has its reasons.<br> Basketball is a voluntary activity.<br> It's not a requirement.<br> If you don't wanna be on the team,<br> feel free to leave now.<br> - Did you hear what I said?<br> - Me?<br> - Yes, you.<br> - I'm just curious to know when we start.<br> - We start when I say so.<br> - Would you let me know? I'm tired of...<br> - All right, out. Right now.<br> - You're kicking me out?<br> Yes. Don't come back until you learn<br> to keep your mouth shut and listen.<br> You're breakin' my heart.<br> Come on, Whit, let's fly this chicken coop.<br> Didn't you say you'd rather be<br> down at Terhune anyway?<br> - It's your funeral.<br> - Let's move, gizzard.<br> I ain't no gizzard.<br> Have fun, Coach, trying to win with five...<br> well, make that four and a half players.<br> OK, let's get those folding chairs.<br> Line 'em up right here.<br> Come on, little man!<br> - Let's move. Come on, let's move!<br> - When do we scrimmage?<br> - We don't scrimmage. No shooting either.<br> - That ain't no fun!<br> My practices aren't designed for your<br> enjoyment. Let's go! Move! Come on!<br> I've seen you can shoot, but<br> there's more to the game than shooting!<br> There's fundamentals and defence.<br> Come on, palms up. Palms up.<br> Come on. Pop. Pop!<br> Get rid of it. Pop. Get rid of it.<br> Hot potato, hot potato. Hold it.<br> Hold it! Hold it.<br> Let's be clear about what we're after here.<br> Wipe that smile off your face.<br> This is not funny.<br> The five players on the floor function as<br> one single unit. Team, team, team, right?<br> No one more important than the other.<br> Pop it. Pop. Get rid of it.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> Come on, big guy. Let's go! Switch!<br> Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Higher!<br> Come on, let's go!<br> Come on, come on, come on, come on!<br> No team of mine will ever run out<br> of steam before its opponents.<br> With only five players, we can't afford to.<br> Go! Let's move! Let's go!<br> - Can I help you?<br> - Just checkin' the boys.<br> We heard you got crazy ways of coachin'.<br> No shootin'. Practisin' without a ball.<br> We got some concern<br> about the way matters are being handled.<br> We'll do this every day.<br> You'll be in the best shape of your lives.<br> - It feels like we're in the army.<br> - You are. You're in my army.<br> Every day between three and five.<br> Listen, guys, practice is closed to<br> outsiders. I don't want any distractions.<br> - Outsiders?<br> - Coach Tidd never closed practices.<br> That was Coach Tidd.<br> This is something else.<br> - Yeah?<br> - Hi. I'm Rollin Butcher.<br> My son's got something to say to you.<br> Sorry, Coach, about walking out. I'd be<br> obliged if I got myself another chance.<br> Won't happen again. You're the boss.<br> OK. There's still an hour<br> of practice. Get dressed.<br> My boys get a little mixed up. You get any<br> trouble from Rade or Whit, let me know.<br> Coach here says he's closing practice<br> to outsiders. You ever...<br> - I'll handle this.<br> - No, I got this.<br> This man's got a job to do. He wants you<br> outta here. You'd better be on your way.<br> Make two lines facing me.<br> Let's go. Come on.<br> Bend your knees, get your butt down.<br> Left hand up, right hand down.<br> To your right. Let's go!<br> To your left. Let's go! Come on, move!<br> Oh, don't worry about George. He'll be<br> right with you when you start winning.<br> Cletus! My friend, my good friend.<br> Friend of years, friend of tears.<br> You're looking fit and fiddle.<br> Wilbur "Shooter" Flatch,<br> this is Norman Dale, our new coach.<br> - How are you?<br> - Coach.<br> Clete, did you tell him? Sectionals in '33.<br> One point down.<br> Five, four, three, two, one...<br> I let her fly!<br> In and out. Yeah. Well, I was fouled.<br> If you had some small change...<br> The missus and I have had<br> a parting of the ways.<br> - Get you something to eat.<br> - Oh, my friend. My dear fine friend.<br> Give it up.<br> - It's only two bits.<br> - Give it up.<br> - Sorry, Everett.<br> - It ain't your fault.<br> - He's my friend of years.<br> - I don't wanna hear it, Dad.<br> Jimmy, I didn't see you in class today.<br> Any reason you want to tell me about?<br> You know, in the ten years that I coached,<br> I never met anybody who<br> wanted to win as badly as I did.<br> I'd do anything I had to do<br> to increase my advantage.<br> Anybody who tried to block<br> the pursuit of that advantage, I'd just...<br> push 'em out of the way. Didn't matter<br> who they were or what they were doing.<br> But that was then.<br> You have a special talent. A gift.<br> Not the school's, not the townspeople,<br> not the team's,<br> not Myra Fleener's,<br> not mine.<br> It's yours... to do with what you choose.<br> Because that's what I believe,<br> I can tell you this.<br> I don't care if you play on the team or not.<br> Mr Dale, I wanna talk to you.<br> Leave him alone, all right?<br> He's a real special kid and<br> I have high hopes for him, and...<br> if he works really hard, he can get an<br> academic scholarship to Wabash College<br> and can get outta this place.<br> - You have something against this place?<br> - For him, yes, I do. He could do better.<br> You know, if Jimmy's as good<br> as everybody says he is,<br> I'd have thought a basketball scholarship<br> would have made a lot of sense.<br> Who'd ever see him play?<br> The only thing that comes into Hickory<br> is the train, and it's here for five minutes.<br> Basketball scholarship... A basketball<br> hero around here is treated like a god.<br> How could he ever find out<br> what he could really do?<br> I don't want this to be the high point of<br> his life. I've seen 'em. The real sad ones.<br> They sit around all their lives talking<br> about the glory days when they were 17.<br> You know, most people would kill to be<br> treated like a god, just for a few moments.<br> Gods come pretty cheap<br> nowadays, don't they?<br> You become one by putting<br> a leather ball in an iron hoop.<br> I hate to tell you this, but it's only a game.<br> Why so unfriendly, Miss Fleener?<br> Well, I know men like you.<br> You don't know anything about me.<br> I know you're here.<br> I know this place doesn't<br> even appear on most state maps.<br> A man your age comes<br> to a place like this, either...<br> he's running from something<br> or he has nowhere else to go.<br> What I'm doing here<br> has nothing to do with you.<br> Just stay away from Jimmy.<br> I don't want him coaching<br> in Hickory when he's 50.<br> Now, folks,<br> let's make him feel welcome.<br> Our new coach, Norman Dale.<br> First of all, I'd like to thank those of you<br> who have made me feel so welcome here.<br> Thank you.<br> The boys and I are<br> getting to know each other,<br> to see who we are, and, uh...<br> what we can be.<br> So far I like what I've seen.<br> I'm very excited to be part<br> of Indiana basketball.<br> This is your team.<br> Rade Butcher!<br> Whit Butcher!<br> Everett Flatch!<br> Ollie McClellan!<br> We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!<br> We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!<br> We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!<br> We want Jimmy! We want Jimmy!<br> We want Jimmy!<br> I would hope you would support<br> who we are, not who we are not.<br> These six individuals<br> have made a choice to work.<br> A choice to sacrifice.<br> To put themselves on the line<br> 23 nights in the next four months.<br> To represent you, this high school.<br> That kind of commitment and effort<br> deserves and demands your respect.<br> This is your team.<br> - Coach, you all right?<br> - Yeah, I'm fine.<br> Now, remember to discipline your game.<br> Absolutely no shots until<br> you've passed off four times.<br> Set your offensive patterns<br> before you go to score. All right?<br> - Is that clear?<br> - Yes.<br> How many times are we gonna pass off?<br> - How many?<br> - Four.<br> Let us pray.<br> Be strong and of good courage.<br> For the Lord thy God is with thee<br> whithersoever thou goest.<br> Lord, bless these boys<br> and the season before them.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> - OK, let's go!<br> - We can beat these guys!<br> Hold it.<br> Strap?<br> How long is he gonna go on like this?<br> I don't know. He'll come<br> when he's ready, not before.<br> I hope that'll be sometime before tip-off.<br> - OK, let's go.<br> - Let's go!<br> - How do you feel?<br> - Like it's my first game.<br> Well, in a way it is.<br> I'll be right there with you.<br> Welcome to Indiana basketball.<br> Hi. How are you?<br> Ollie, you get ready. You're gonna play<br> until Strap gets here. If he ever does.<br> - I'll go get him.<br> - No.<br> OK, guys. A minimum of four passes<br> before you take a shot. All right?<br> Get yourselves set before you let go.<br> Five pistons firing together. All right?<br> Come on. Come on. Team.<br> - Thank God.<br> - Team!<br> We got spirit, how 'bout you?<br> We got spirit, yes, we do!<br> We got spirit, how 'bout you?<br> We got spirit, yes, we do!<br> We got spirit, how 'bout you?<br> Four passes!<br> Don't just stand there! Move!<br> Shoot the ball, Rade!<br> What's wrong with you?!<br> Work the good shot!<br> - Put the ball up!<br> - Shoot it!<br> Put up your defence!<br> Hold out the switcher!<br> Is that what you call coaching?<br> Four passes! Pass the ball in!<br> Work it in for the good shot!<br> Work the good shot!<br> Strap, come on! Move!<br> Come on, defence!<br> Block it out! Block it out!<br> Come on, set up the offence!<br> Pass it off! Pass it off!<br> Four passes!<br> - Work for the good shot!<br> - Shoot the ball!<br> Come on!<br> I want you to close down those<br> passing lanes. Your defence is awful!<br> - What about our offence? We can't win...<br> - Keep your mouth shut until I tell you.<br> What kind of wing-nut stunt are you<br> trying to pull?! Chrissakes, mister...<br> - Get out of here! Get out!<br> - It's embarrassing...<br> Stay out!<br> I don't want anybody in this locker room<br> at half-time. Keep them outta here.<br> Norm, I'm trying hard to believe<br> that you know what you're doing.<br> I know what I'm doing.<br> You've got three fouls.<br> Guys, remember what we worked on<br> in practice. I wanna see it on the court!<br> How many times are we gonna pass<br> before we shoot? How many?<br> Four.<br> Four!<br> Set it up! Set it up!<br> Rade! Rade! Pass the ball!<br> Ollie, go in for Rade.<br> Now! Move! Come on.<br> Good job, Rade.<br> - Foul. Number 12.<br> - Oh, come on!<br> That's five.<br> - 25.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - In the game.<br> - Sit down.<br> What do you mean?<br> We gotta have five out there.<br> Sit down! Sit!<br> Coach, you need one more.<br> - My team's on the floor.<br> - OK.<br> - What are you trying to do?<br> - He's only got four men.<br> Those of you on the floor<br> at the end, I'm proud of you.<br> You played your guts out.<br> I'm only gonna say this one time.<br> All of you have the weekend.<br> Think about whether or not<br> you wanna be on this team or not...<br> under the following condition.<br> What I say when it comes to<br> this basketball team is the law,<br> absolutely and without discussion.<br> Come on, guys.<br> Let's listen to what he says.<br> - Shut up.<br> - You shut up, Rade.<br> Hey, Coach, how about a haircut?<br> - Who cuts your hair?<br> - Yours truly.<br> Oh, no.<br> Hey, gonna play with three next time?<br> Those aren't bad odds, five against three!<br> - Let me help you there.<br> - Oh. Appreciate it.<br> Opal Fleener.<br> I been hearing plenty on you.<br> Mother likes basketball.<br> - That's the truth, and then some.<br> - Here.<br> It's all right. I can do it, thank you.<br> Mother, it's late. Better get going.<br> Sun don't shine on<br> the same dog's ass every day, but...<br> mister, you ain't seen<br> a ray of light since you got here.<br> I believe it's time we had a talk.<br> Sunday.<br> Supper.<br> I accept.<br> Coach, tell me about the boys.<br> You think you can bring 'em around?<br> Well, there's a lot of talent there.<br> It's just raw and undisciplined.<br> What are you gonna do about that?<br> I'm gonna break 'em down<br> and then I'm gonna build 'em back up.<br> - This fire needs more wood.<br> - I'll get it.<br> No, you won't.<br> Basketball...<br> Every game my brother played was the<br> most important thing ever in this family.<br> Mother wouldn't be able<br> to sleep the night before.<br> And if they lost, Daddy would<br> walk the floor until morning.<br> I never figured out why it meant so much.<br> Not to that extreme. I don't get it.<br> Well, what are you doing here,<br> living in Hickory?<br> I haven't always been here. I went to<br> college three years, graduate school...<br> Graduate school?<br> Surprised? You sound like my father.<br> He thought it strange I ever wanted to<br> leave town. Kept telling me I'd be back.<br> I guess he was right.<br> Why'd you come back?<br> Didn't work out. Daddy died,<br> Mother got sick. I had to come back.<br> And you never plan on leaving?<br> Ever consider getting married? Come on,<br> you must have had a lot of opportunities.<br> You know, during all those years away,<br> there are a few things I missed,<br> not being here.<br> I missed knowin' nothing changes, people<br> never change. It makes you feel real solid.<br> I also missed knowing that people's<br> private affairs stay pretty much their own.<br> OK. I'm sorry.<br> Hey, Coach.<br> Ain't it a little late to be calling on folks?<br> I wouldn't trust old Rooster neither.<br> Oh, this is a nice place you got here.<br> It's a nice night for a fire.<br> - That's a hell of a team you had there.<br> - You knew that team?<br> I know everything there is to know<br> about the greatest game ever invented.<br> - Did you know about...<br> - Now, that don't matter.<br> A man's got to do what he's got to do.<br> You're playing Cedar Knob tomorrow.<br> Ain't nobody knows 'em better than me.<br> Now, I been watchin'<br> how you been breakin' the colts.<br> But, my friend, you cannot play them<br> all the way man-on-man.<br> They got no head toppers.<br> Cedar Knob? A bunch of mites.<br> Run you off the boards.<br> You got to squeeze 'em back in the paint.<br> Make 'em chuck it from the cheap seats.<br> Watch that purgatory they call a gym.<br> No drive, 12 foot in.<br> That'll do.<br> - How did your father get this job?<br> - It's our bus.<br> It doesn't look like a preacher's bus.<br> Well, after sectional's over, we paint it<br> white for the summer tent shows, but...<br> every fall, back to red.<br> After his revelation.<br> Well, God told him.<br> To paint the bus and drive the team?<br> These guys are like animals. How can<br> anybody play in this cracker box?<br> Their boy Nelson, he can't go to his left.<br> I know that.<br> - Time-out!<br> -<br> - Hey, come on! Leave me alone!<br> - OK, guys, listen up.<br> We can run on these guys.<br> The two guards are never gettin' back.<br> - Sorry. I can't help my mouth.<br> - You be sorry on the bench.<br> Strap, go in for Rade. Buddy,<br> get the ball between their guards.<br> Watch for Everett and Merle cutting<br> to the basket, all right? OK, let's go.<br> Team!<br> That's a flagrant foul!<br> That player should be out of the game!<br> - He didn't do nothing wrong.<br> - Come on, that's hillbilly justice!<br> You ain't been here long, have you?<br> Long enough to recognise<br> a hometown referee!<br> Technical foul.<br> Look, it's bad enough we gotta play<br> in this cage you call a gym.<br> - Your players are playing like gorillas!<br> - Who you calling a gorilla?<br> You, for one!<br> Bust off.<br> Come on, boys. You wanna<br> stay in this game, go back to the bench.<br> I don't want to see you again!<br> Not in this game! You're out!<br> You're gone, both of you. Out!<br> Come on, boys.<br> - You all right?<br> - Yeah, I'm OK.<br> You better get outta here.<br> I'll do the best I can.<br> Good riddance, you jackass!<br> - Got him a good one, didn't I, Coach?<br> - Yeah, you did.<br> Just a little while, OK?<br> How you feeling?<br> Tired.<br> They're sayin' my pump's<br> going bad on me.<br> Why didn't you tell me?<br> No need for that.<br> I guess the doctor says<br> you gotta it take easy.<br> - No more basketball games for a while.<br> - Yeah.<br> Well, looks like you're on your own.<br> Oh, that's fine.<br> You kinda like being on your own.<br> I'd kinda like to see you up on your feet.<br> You can count on it.<br> Anybody home?<br> Identify!<br> - It's Norm.<br> - Norm?<br> - Yeah.<br> - What you doin' out here?<br> What happened to my scout?<br> We're playing Verdi tonight.<br> Verdi, huh? Well, we'll talk.<br> This is my domicile here.<br> Sit yourself down over there<br> by the fire and warm up.<br> - This is it, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> It gets pretty rough here<br> in the winter, but I manage.<br> - Want a little snort?<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Don't mind if I do.<br> - I got a proposition for you.<br> Cletus is gonna be laid up for a while,<br> and I want you to give me a hand.<br> Well, I can tell you anything<br> that you need to know.<br> No, you don't understand.<br> I want you to be my assistant.<br> I want you to come to the practices and<br> sit on the bench with me during games.<br> Me? You want me?<br> What do you say?<br> Under the following conditions.<br> That you, uh...<br> clean yourself up and, uh...<br> you shave.<br> You show up at the games on time, and<br> the practices, and wear a shirt and tie.<br> I got myself a suit, right there. I got a<br> wingdinger. I was married in that suit.<br> And that you're sober.<br> Oh, no.<br> - My wife sent you.<br> - No.<br> My son?<br> What... what has my drinkin' got to do<br> with my knowledge about basketball?<br> You can't drink in front of these boys.<br> If I smell even a trace of liquor<br> on your breath, you'll be finished.<br> I don't have to hear that from you.<br> You're embarrassing your son.<br> I don't need to hear that.<br> I'd... I'd like you to leave.<br> I'd like you to leave now.<br> Time-out, ref!<br> Nice shot, Rade.<br> Guys, you're playing real well. Real well.<br> Put more pressure on the ball.<br> Be real patient on your offence.<br> What's he doin' here?<br> Shooter here is gonna be<br> one of our assistants. Got it?<br> You got anything you wanna...?<br> - Coach, you figure on playing ball or not?<br> - Yeah, we'll be there.<br> - OK, come on.<br> - Let's go!<br> Team!<br> Come on, play ball. Play ball.<br> - I ain't feelin' real good.<br> - You'll be fine.<br> The kids are starting to get it.<br> I mean, it's really fun.<br> Progress.<br> Progress is electricity,<br> school consolidation,<br> church remodelling, second farm tractors,<br> second farm cars, hay balers...<br> Corn-pickers, grain combines,<br> field choppers and indoor plumbing.<br> All right, you're dismissed.<br> What's on your mind?<br> Well...<br> Coach, what you're doing with my dad...<br> I'm not seeing it.<br> Why not?<br> Cos he's a drunk,<br> he'll do something stupid.<br> When's the last time<br> somebody gave him a chance?<br> He don't deserve a chance.<br> Go on.<br> How are you?<br> I've been asked, as acting principal,<br> to inform you that<br> a petition has been issued<br> requesting a referendum<br> on your removal as basketball coach.<br> The vote'll be made<br> at a town meeting on Saturday.<br> I guess that gives me until<br> Friday night's game to prove myself, huh?<br> I think it goes a lot deeper<br> than one game, don't you?<br> Time-out! Time-out!<br> Technical foul. On the floor<br> while the game was in progress.<br> The ball was dead.<br> I was calling a time-out.<br> - You're gone.<br> - What?!<br> Out. I'm reporting you<br> to the state commission.<br> What?! What are you talking about?!<br> I'm not leaving here!<br> You're gone!<br> That ain't fair. It ain't fair what people<br> in this town are trying to do to you.<br> You stay in the game.<br> I need your help. Stay in the game.<br> Shooter's gonna take you home.<br> You pay attention.<br> Hi. Sorry.<br> It's me. Cletus told me<br> where I could find you.<br> I used to play in these fields.<br> I used to wonder what it would feel like<br> to start walking and just keep going.<br> That's tempting.<br> Aren't you the kind who'd rather<br> look for a fight than run away?<br> What?<br> "Norman Dale, coach of national<br> champions Ithaca Warriors,<br> was given a lifetime suspension,<br> to be honoured by all NCAA signatories,<br> for physically assaulting his own player<br> in Ithaca's last season's game."<br> "This was the latest<br> in a series of incidents<br> involving the successful<br> though highly volatile coach."<br> "The New York High School Athletic<br> Association will honour the suspension."<br> - Where'd you find that article?<br> - The library in Deerlick.<br> I was curious.<br> I wanna tell you that I think your efforts<br> in regards to Shooter have been noble.<br> They have, they've been fine.<br> And I appreciate you staying away<br> from Jimmy the way you have.<br> I don't think you'd better be there tonight.<br> It won't be pleasant.<br> I've made some mistakes, but they're<br> mistakes I take full responsibility for.<br> I was hired to teach the boys the game of<br> basketball. I did it to the best of my ability.<br> I apologise for nothing.<br> You may not be pleased<br> with the results, but I am.<br> I'm very proud of these boys.<br> I, um...<br> I think, in order to be fair...<br> I think it would be a big mistake<br> to let Coach Dale go.<br> Give him a chance.<br> Sam and Rollin<br> will pass out the ballots.<br> A "yes" vote means he stays, a "no" vote<br> he goes. Let's do this as quick as we can.<br> Jimmy, what are you doing here?<br> - What can I do for you, Jimmy?<br> - I got something to say.<br> Son, you better say what you got to say.<br> I don't know if it'll make any change,<br> but I figure it's time for me<br> to start playing ball.<br> I told you, once we got rid of him!<br> One other thing.<br> I play, Coach stays. He goes, I go.<br> Look, wait. The coach<br> is dismissed by a vote of 68 to 45.<br> I think we should vote again!<br> There's a call for a revote.<br> All those in favour of<br> the coach staying say "aye".<br> Aye!<br> Those opposed?<br> Nay!<br> Coach stays.<br> Hey! You listen to me.<br> I stuck my neck out for you.<br> Live up to your end of the bargain,<br> or get in a hospital and dry out.<br> - I don't think I can cut it.<br> - You can. I didn't think I could cut it.<br> But after what Jimmy did, it would take<br> the Indiana National Guard to get me out.<br> - My nerves are shot.<br> - Hey, we're coming together as a team.<br> With Jimmy, all the pistons are firing.<br> We got ten games to play, right?<br> We're gonna be a tough team to beat.<br> Now you come along for the ride, OK?<br> But you got to give me your word that<br> you will not be kicked out of no games.<br> Scout's honour.<br> Scout's honour!<br> That's a foul<br> on number 21 in the red.<br> I just wanna discuss this with him.<br> Just take it easy.<br> - You got pigeon shit in your eyes?<br> - Now, relax.<br> You're pathetic!<br> You're a disgrace to your profession!<br> - Kick me out.<br> - You're putting me on.<br> No. Kick me out of the game or<br> I'll start screaming like a mad fool.<br> You got your reasons. You're outta here!<br> - What?! Oh, come on!<br> - No!<br> Come on! That's ridiculous!<br> I've done it again.<br> It's up to you now.<br> I told him not to.<br> Time-out.<br> You reckon number four<br> will put up their last shot, Dad?<br> Yeah, probably.<br> They've been picking low all night.<br> Yeah.<br> Uh...<br> Rade, let yourself get taken out.<br> Buddy, you drop down and take his place.<br> Close that lane.<br> - All right! OK, team.<br> - Team!<br> Come on!<br> - Time! Time!<br> - Time-out!<br> Come over here, come over here.<br> All right, now listen to me.<br> This is the last shot that we got. All right?<br> We're gonna run the picket fence at 'em.<br> Merle, you're the swingman.<br> Jimmy, you're solo right.<br> All right. Merle should be open,<br> swinging around the end of that fence.<br> Now, boys, don't get caught<br> watching the paint dry.<br> - All right.<br> - Team!<br> Yeah! We did it!<br> You did good, Pop. You did real good.<br> - You did it, Shooter!<br> - Good job! Whoo!<br> SECTIONAL FINAL, DEERLICK, INDIANA<br> - Where's your father?<br> - He said he wanted to be alone.<br> Too much pressure.<br> - You keep in the game. All right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Mentally.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Hey, ref! Call it both ways!<br> Come on!<br> He's got his hands all over him!<br> I've got 12, red.<br> Oh, come on!<br> What are you talking about?!<br> Hey! Hey! Whoa!<br> Hey! Come on! That was no foul!<br> No. You were out of position to make<br> a call. He was charging all the way.<br> - Get him outta here.<br> - His feet were planted.<br> He was charging all the way!<br> - Norm, his feet were planted.<br> - We know that, we know that.<br> Get that bozo to wear glasses!<br> Come on, come on.<br> It's OK. He's an assistant coach. It's fine.<br> - That's a technical foul.<br> - What are you talking about? Wait!<br> He just wandered out on the floor!<br> Don't tell me that! Oh, Jesus!<br> You keep in the game, Everett.<br> You understand?<br> Come on, play hard.<br> He's cut.<br> Oh, mercy. Let's get him on his feet.<br> Forfeit that team. My boy can't<br> even play. He's all racked up.<br> Hey, if you lose,<br> then we'll protest. All right?<br> That's a gutless way to win!<br> - Get out of my face!<br> - Let's play ball.<br> Get the ball! Get the ball!<br> Dad!<br> Shooter!<br> Shooter!<br> Dad!<br> Dad!<br> Boy, a couple of months in here<br> and you'll be as dry as the Sahara desert.<br> It's goblin visiting time, eh?<br> Oh, come on.<br> We're gonna be here for you.<br> Yeah. You and the little green monkeys.<br> - Oh, God. How's my son doing?<br> - Oh, he's fine.<br> He had eight stitches but, boy,<br> he played his heart out. He was just...<br> The doc says he's gonna be OK<br> for the regionals in about a week.<br> - He's a good boy.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm so proud of you, Coach. I am.<br> Sectional champs?<br> I know what that means<br> to these folks around here.<br> A lot.<br> I remember what it meant to me.<br> You're a big part of it.<br> No.<br> Coach, I'm freezing.<br> Yeah, OK.<br> Could we have a blanket, please?<br> Goddammit. You know I didn't mean...<br> I didn't make a lick of difference.<br> You know that.<br> You got yourself a shiftless,<br> no-account drunk.<br> Oh, God.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Basketball meant so much to me, Coach.<br> I'm so proud of you.<br> - I'm so sorry I let you down.<br> - Come on, Shooter.<br> Nothing could be further from the truth.<br> Nurse. I'm so thirsty.<br> I'm so sorry, Coach.<br> - You're gonna protect us?<br> - There's not enough apologising.<br> - Get the team in the gym.<br> - I've never seen nothing like this.<br> I wish they'd wait till after the game.<br> Does the team feel<br> they can make it to the finals?<br> REGIONAL FINALS, JASPER, INDIANA<br> Let's go. Let us through.<br> There is a, um... tradition<br> in tournament play<br> to not talk about the next step until<br> you've climbed the one in front of you.<br> Going to the finals is beyond your wildest<br> dreams, so let's just keep it right there.<br> Forget about the crowds,<br> the size of the school,<br> their fancy uniforms,<br> and remember what got you here.<br> Focus on the fundamentals that<br> we've gone over time and time again<br> and, most important, don't get caught up<br> in thinking about winning or losing.<br> If you put your effort into playing to your<br> potential, to be the best that you can be,<br> I don't care what<br> the scoreboard says at the end,<br> in my book we're gonna be winners.<br> OK?<br> All right!<br> Let's go! Let's go!<br> Let me hear it!<br> - Let's go!<br> - Go! Go!<br> Ref! He's moving his pivot foot!<br> He's moving his pivot foot!<br> Block him out! Block him out!<br> Block 41 off the baseline!<br> OK.<br> Come on!<br> Everett, stop that pass to the low post.<br> Rade, you come off your man<br> and give us some help inside.<br> Buddy, 41 is killing us. He's just killing us.<br> Stick with him.<br> You can think of chewing gum.<br> By the end of the game I want<br> to know what flavour he is. OK?<br> Great shot! Great shot!<br> Block him off! Block him off the baseline!<br> Foul on number 25. Butcher.<br> That's Butcher's fifth personal foul.<br> His feet were planted! He was there first!<br> - The stitches are pulled.<br> - Patch him up.<br> - I can't do it.<br> - Patch him up! Are you out of your mind?<br> - Hey, you keep blocking out.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - We're gonna win this game.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Call time-out. Time-out.<br> - Time-out. White.<br> - On the bench.<br> - I wanna play.<br> Come on, you're on the bench.<br> Strap, you're gonna play for Everett.<br> Don't shoot unless you're under the<br> basket all by yourself. Understand? OK.<br> We got two minutes<br> and 15 seconds, all right?<br> Be patient. Work for the good shot. Got it?<br> Team!<br> Let's go. Come on.<br> Let's go, Strap. Let's go.<br> Strap...<br> God wants you on the floor.<br> Hey, that was a great shot!<br> Time-out!<br> Time-out, Hickory.<br> - What's gotten into you?<br> - The Lord. I can feel his strength.<br> Keep his strength in the dribble, all right?<br> On me?! Oh, no!<br> - Foul on number 14, white.<br> - Are you joking?<br> Come on! Give us a break!<br> Number 14. Walker.<br> That's his fifth personal foul.<br> Good game.<br> Ollie, we need you.<br> Ollie, we need you now.<br> Go get 'em.<br> It was Dentyne.<br> Substitution for Hickory -<br> number 13, McClellan.<br> Let's go!<br> Foul him!<br> Orange 1-0.<br> - Come on! Let's go!<br> - Let's go. You can do it.<br> Come on, let's go, Big Ollie.<br> I got number 10,<br> orange. Two shots.<br> Time-out, ref. Time-out.<br> It's time-out. Orange.<br> OK, let's go, guys. All right, listen.<br> After Ollie makes his second shot -<br> and you will make your second shot -<br> get back on defence right away.<br> There may just be time for them<br> to throw in a desperation toss.<br> - All right. Let's go.<br> - Put 'em in, Ollie.<br> Team!<br> Make it a good one, Strap.<br> Didn't know they grew 'em<br> so small down on the farm.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> You just concentrate on what you're doing<br> and put it in the hole, right? You can do it.<br> One more. One more and we're going<br> all the way, all right? Concentrate.<br> - Ollie!<br> - Just one more! Just one more!<br> Pin 'em down. Pin 'em down.<br> You always garden in the mud?<br> The Almanac says<br> it's time to start planting.<br> Is the Almanac always right?<br> Always.<br> The farmer's daughter.<br> - Miller's.<br> - Miller's.<br> Your mother cut my hair.<br> Yeah, I saw your car.<br> Like to take a walk?<br> That's pretty.<br> Yeah. In the late spring those fields<br> are so green it looks like Ireland.<br> How I always imagined<br> Ireland would look.<br> I've seen it in pictures and postcards.<br> Would you like to go to Deerlick<br> some evening? Take in a movie?<br> "Norman Dale, coach of the Ithaca<br> Warriors, was suspended for..."<br> I can't really explain that.<br> It's been a number of years and it still<br> kind of goes around in my head. I...<br> I slow it down. Sometimes<br> I really think that I can stop my fist<br> from hitting that boy's jaw.<br> One second and everything<br> I'd worked for was just all finished.<br> Funny thing, too. He was the best kid<br> that ever played for me.<br> Tough, stubborn and wilful.<br> Sounds like someone I know.<br> I imagined kissing you<br> ever since I first saw you.<br> I was just tired of imagining it.<br> It's been a long time.<br> For me too.<br> All right, let's go. Let's go.<br> - Coach, how did you do it?<br> - It wasn't me. It was the boys.<br> ...miss that final shot?<br> - No. I knew I had it all the way.<br> Really?<br> - Tell you later.<br> - The team you're against in the final,<br> South Bend Central, is one of<br> the power teams in the state.<br> Their front line is 6'4", 6'5" and 6'5".<br> - How can your little guys compete?<br> - I don't know.<br> - Do you have a scouting report?<br> - More important to me than that,<br> my boys only know basketball, farming<br> and school, probably in that order.<br> Most of 'em have never seen<br> a building taller than two storeys.<br> So taking them to Indianapolis<br> to play in front of 15,000 people<br> is kind of like you and me<br> going to the moon.<br> Who we play is the least of my concerns.<br> Will you be back at Hickory next year?<br> It's a good question.<br> No school this small has ever been<br> in the state championship.<br> I know. I was coach for a while.<br> I won a big game for 'em.<br> I coached the last two minutes.<br> I took 'em right down to the wire. I run<br> the picket fence on 'em, and we won!<br> And my son, he's on...<br> How you doin', Dad?<br> The conquering hero. I heard the game<br> right there on that little Philco,<br> and I heard old Ollie dribble on his foot<br> and then make that charity shot.<br> I started bawling, and they bring the white<br> coats in here and they put a jacket on me.<br> I was feeling so good<br> I didn't even mind too much.<br> You're doing good?<br> Well...<br> I feel real empty inside and, uh...<br> I have some bad visions.<br> Son...<br> - the other night...<br> - It don't matter, Dad.<br> You're gonna get better.<br> In a couple of months, when you get<br> outta here, we're gonna get a house.<br> Both of us.<br> I love you, Dad.<br> I gotta get back.<br> Son?<br> Oh, I wish I could be there.<br> I'll be thinking of you.<br> Son, kick their butt.<br> Anyway, I'll tell you one thing.<br> No school this small has ever been<br> in the state championship!<br> Hi, Coach Dale. Coach Butcher.<br> Welcome to Butler Fieldhouse.<br> Your practice schedule is from 10 to 12.<br> The game will be at seven o'clock.<br> If you need anything, just let me know.<br> I think this is the most exciting thing<br> to ever happen to Indiana basketball.<br> So we're all behind you.<br> Good luck, and tear 'em up.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Good luck, guys.<br> Buddy.<br> Hold this under the backboard.<br> - What is it?<br> - 15 feet.<br> 15 feet. Strap, put Ollie on your shoulders.<br> Measure this from the rim.<br> Buddy.<br> - How far?<br> - Ten feet.<br> Ten feet.<br> I think you'll find this is the exact same<br> measurements as our gym in Hickory.<br> OK, let's get dressed for practice.<br> Hickory!<br> It is big.<br> Welcome, ladies and<br> gentlemen, to the championship game<br> of the Indiana State High School<br> Basketball Tournament.<br> The most incredible<br> and improbable confrontation<br> in the illustrious history of<br> the Indiana High School Tournament<br> takes place in tonight's game,<br> where the pint-sized, hardly-big-enough<br> for-three-syllables Hickory Huskers,<br> enrolment 64, take on the<br> defending state champions,<br> the mighty Bears of South Bend<br> Central, with an enrolment of 2800.<br> Already calling this<br> the game of the century,<br> newspeople from all over<br> the Middle West are here<br> to witness Hoosierland's<br> version of the Cinderella story.<br> ? Oh, say does that<br> star-spangled banner yet wave<br> ? O'er the land of the free<br> ? And the home of the brave?<br> And now, the starting line-up<br> for the Huskers.<br> We've been all over this before.<br> Their top player is Boyle, number 15.<br> He, uh... averages<br> about 20 points a game.<br> Buddy, you gotta stick right with him.<br> No inside penetration.<br> Shut down those passing lanes.<br> Play tough off those boards<br> to negate their height advantage.<br> Hickory, it's time to take the floor.<br> - I'll get the preacher.<br> - OK.<br> Well, we're way past the big-speech time.<br> I wanna thank you<br> for the last few months.<br> It's been very special for me.<br> Anybody have anything they wanna say?<br> Yeah.<br> Let's win this one for all the small schools<br> that never had a chance to get here.<br> OK.<br> I wanna win for my dad.<br> Let's win for Coach, who got us here.<br> Thank you.<br> With God of heaven it is all one,<br> to deliver with a great multitude<br> or a small company.<br> For the victory of battle standeth<br> not in the multitude of host,<br> but strength cometh from heaven.<br> And David put his hand in the bag<br> and took out a stone and slung it,<br> and struck the Philistine on the head,<br> and he fell to the ground.<br> Amen.<br> - I love you guys.<br> - Team!<br> Call time-out! Time-out!<br> Time-out, Hickory.<br> - God, these guys are good.<br> - This is embarrassing.<br> I can't stop that guy.<br> Maybe they were right about us.<br> Maybe we don't belong up here.<br> Let's go. Come on!<br> - Can I say something?<br> - Yeah!<br> Jimmy can take the guy<br> that's guardin' him if we set him up.<br> What about it, Jimmy?<br> - All right, let's go. Come on!<br> - Go!<br> Get 'em! Come on!<br> Buddy! Buddy!<br> Calm them down. Be patient.<br> Two minutes ten seconds to go.<br> South Bend Central on top 40-34.<br> Hickory in possession.<br> Buddy Walker with the ball.<br> He passes to Everett Flatch.<br> He throws to Merle Webb.<br> Then there's Jimmy Chitwood,<br> face right, jump shot... Scores!<br> Back to Willie Long. Then back to Wilber,<br> who is signalling the play.<br> Will they release the ball?<br> Wilber dribbles to his left.<br> Passes over to Long.<br> Long holding the basketball.<br> All right! All right!<br> Buddy! Full-court press after this shot.<br> He signals the play<br> and passes to Jimmy Chitwood.<br> Chitwood along the right sideline.<br> Bounce passes to Flatch.<br> Flatch finds Walker.<br> Walker's shot. Not good.<br> Walker comes around the outside.<br> Steals the ball. Passes to Chitwood.<br> It's 40 to 38. 33 seconds to go.<br> Sensational comeback. Earl having<br> trouble with the advance pass.<br> Intercepted by Jimmy Chitwood.<br> It's now 40-40. Hickory have scored<br> six consecutive points.<br> Get the ball. Get the ball.<br> Grab it, grab it, grab it, grab it!<br> Come on, come on, come on.<br> All right, listen up.<br> Here's what we're gonna do.<br> Jimmy, they'll be expecting you<br> to take the last shot.<br> We're gonna use you as a decoy.<br> Buddy, you get the ball,<br> give it to Merle on the picket fence.<br> He's gonna take the last shot.<br> All right, let's go.<br> What's the matter with you guys?<br> What's the matter with you?<br> I'll make it.<br> All right. Buddy, get the ball<br> to Jimmy at the top of the key.<br> Let's go.<br> Team!<br> They may be seeing<br> basketball history here tonight.<br> A sensational comeback by Hickory.<br> The score is tied at 40.<br> There are 19 fateful seconds<br> remaining in the game.<br> It'll be inbounded by Hickory<br> in the backcourt, along the sideline,<br> passed in by Rade Butcher,<br> who was responsible for the interception.<br> It goes in to Buddy Walker.<br> Take your time. Take your time.<br> OK, Jimmy!<br> Be patient. Be patient.<br> Come on, let's go!<br> Yes! Yeah!<br> Jimmy, I want you to meet<br> someone. Norman Dale, our new coach.<br> I've seen you guys can shoot, but<br> there's more to the game than shooting!<br> There's fundamentals and defence.<br> The boys and I are getting<br> to know each other,<br> to see who we are and what we can be.<br> Let's be real clear about<br> what we're after here. All right?<br> Team, team, team.<br> The five players on the floor<br> function as one single unit.<br> OK?<br> No one more important than the other.<br> I love you guys.<br> Abigail Smith and Rob
