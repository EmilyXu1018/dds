                        In the dim light of early morning...<br> ...perhaps also in the dim light<br> between peace and war...<br> ...the king returns to London.<br> A few hours later, His Majesty<br> holds a Privy Council.<br> While hour by hour, the tension grows<br> all over the world.<br> Before lunch, Mr. Chamberlain returns<br> from an audience with the king.<br> In the afternoon, Parliament assembles<br> to write a new page in its long history.<br> There has been no doubt that every<br> British citizen would play his part.<br> London prepares its defences<br> against attack from the air.<br> It's every citizen's duty to know<br> what to do should an air raid come.<br> Do you know the warning signal? To<br> remind you, we repeat them, softly...<br> ...to av oid alarming anyone who<br> might hear them outside this theatre.<br> All clear.<br> Have you brought your gas masks<br> for your family?<br> It was all they talk ed about,<br> getting ready for war...<br> ...but nothing ever happened.<br> It was all words and no action.<br> Hopalong Cassidy,<br> on the other hand...<br> ...now that was the real thing.<br> Sunday, the 3rd of September, 1939.<br> Everyone who is old enough<br> and was there...<br> ...remembers exactly what they<br> were doing at that moment.<br> I had just gunned down<br> a couple of rustlers.<br> And then I slipped back<br> a few centuries...<br> ...and I was riding<br> through an enchanted forest.<br> The magician Merlin<br> suddenly appeared before me...<br> ...and my horse reared up in terror.<br> Then something even more<br> extraordinary happened.<br> All the Sunday-morning lawnmowers<br> suddenly stopped.<br> This is London. You will now hear<br> a statement by the prime minister.<br> I am speaking to you from<br> the Cabinet room in 10 Downing Street.<br> This morning,<br> the British ambassador in Berlin...<br> ...handed the German government<br> a final note...<br> ...stating that unless we heard<br> from them by 11:00...<br> ...that they were prepared at once<br> to withdraw their troops from Poland...<br> ...a state of war would exist<br> between us.<br> I have to tell you now...<br> ...that no such undertaking<br> has been received...<br> ...and that consequently,<br> this country...<br> ...is at war with Germany.<br> His actions show convincingly...<br> Stop that, Sue!<br> She just sings it,<br> she doesn't even know what it means.<br> Where are my stockings?<br> I can't find my stockings.<br> Dawn, pet, they've started war.<br> Have they? That's not my fault.<br> I still need my stockings, don't I?<br> I don't want to hear<br> about your stockings!<br> It's an air raid!<br> Good God. They've started already.<br> Air raid!<br> Get down! Stay down!<br> It's the all clear.<br> Testing.<br> They were just testing.<br> We all expected to be bombed right<br> away, but nothing happened for ages.<br> It was a perfect summer's morning...<br> ...and everyone said, "Fancy starting<br> a war on such a beautiful day. "<br> Such a beautiful day to...<br> A few lawnmowers started up again,<br> but they didn't ring true somehow.<br> Nothing would ever be<br> the same again.<br> Are you gonna give me a hand,<br> Mac, or not?<br> Dad, it's full of water again.<br> Oh, blast!<br> Comes up through the clay.<br> You should've sealed it with hot pitch.<br> Caulked it, like the hull of a ship.<br> It's not fair on them.<br> It's selfish to keep them with you.<br> You remember that aunt<br> I told you about in Australia?<br> - Well, she has offered to have them.<br> - Snap it up.<br> Great chance for them.<br> I mean, a lot more future out there.<br> It's so far away.<br> I couldn't bear it.<br> Building an air-raid shelter<br> is hungry work, Grace.<br> Well, a few bombs<br> might wake up this country.<br> Take more than a few bombs<br> to wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.<br> - This phoney war gets on my nerves.<br> - Morning.<br> If we're going to have a war,<br> I wish they'd start.<br> - Now, now, Dawn.<br> - Just ignore her, Mac.<br> Well, this waiting about's<br> getting us all down.<br> We'll have to wait<br> about 10 minutes for lunch.<br> - Still remember your drill, Mac?<br> - There you are.<br> Hup, two, three, dash.<br> You see that?<br> The moths haven't got this, then.<br> You kept the old Sam Browne<br> all these years?<br> - Certainly.<br> - And kept it polished.<br> Might come in useful.<br> Oh, steady. Steady.<br> Having received<br> His Majesty's permission...<br> ...I have formed an administration<br> of men and women of every party...<br> ...and of almost every point of view.<br> - Now one bond unites us all:<br> - Dad.<br> To wage war until victory is won...<br> ...and never to surrender ourselves<br> to servitude and shame...<br> ...whatever the cost...<br> - Come on.<br> ...and the agony may be.<br> Bloody gin.<br> Always makes me cry.<br> Couple of crossed wires.<br> She only weeps when she's happy.<br> Oh, stop it, Molly.<br> You'll start me off now.<br> Now, Grace, Grace...<br> It's duty, Mac. It's our duty.<br> For a mug, Clive.<br> We did our bit in the last lot.<br> King and country call, Mac.<br> You'll go as soon as I will.<br> What did we know?<br> Couple of kids, 17.<br> I heard the drum and fife<br> yesterday, Mac...<br> ...marching past.<br> Made my hair stand on end.<br> There we go.<br> There we go, Mol.<br> - We've been asleep for 20 years.<br> - Go to hell!<br> Come on.<br> - Good night, Molly.<br> - Good night.<br> Do you know what time it is?<br> Go to bed this minute.<br> Don't worry, Sue. We're not gonna be<br> like them when we grow up.<br> We're not even like them now.<br> We're standing in the pouring rain<br> off the side of...<br> - a road squelching with mud<br> and lined right away...<br> ...over the plain to the far skyline with<br> the inevitable double row of poplars.<br> A few lorries only are splashing by<br> to and from the forward areas.<br> Coming down the road towards us...<br> ...is a battalion that I know<br> to be the famous Irish Regiment.<br> They're marching in threes.<br> And in their full battle dress and kit...<br> ...they blend with the dripping<br> green grass of the roadside...<br> ...and the brown haystacks.<br> Forward!<br> I rode into battle with a drawn sword<br> against the Turks.<br> Don't be a mug.<br> We did our bit in the last lot.<br> - Don't be a mug.<br> - I heard the drum and fife yesterday.<br> - This country...<br> - Marching past.<br> - Made my hair stand on end.<br> ... is at war with Germany.<br> - A couple of kids, 17.<br> - I fought against the Turks.<br> - Your place is with Grace and the kids!<br> ... wage war until victory is won.<br> Dad!<br> Dad!<br> Uncle Mac.<br> Dad.<br> - Dad.<br> - Get up, boys.<br> - Well, it's lovely to see you.<br> - Absolutely smashing to see you.<br> - Take care of yourself.<br> - And you.<br> - See you in uniform, eh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Take care.<br> - Take care.<br> Hello, kids.<br> Oh, sorry, kids.<br> I joined up.<br> I needed some Dutch courage<br> to tell your mother.<br> - Never say "die. "<br> - Steady the Buffs.<br> Up the arsenal!<br> He's one of the best.<br> Get away.<br> Daddy, you shut his hand<br> in the door.<br> Silly beggar.<br> We're trying to win a war...<br> ...and you start off by shutting<br> your fingers in a car door.<br> My hand. Sorry.<br> That's it for the duration.<br> Pop in and give her a polish,<br> Billy boy...<br> ...just now and then.<br> A car needs to be cherished.<br> Has Sue got it right?<br> What's that?<br> - You joined up.<br> - Oh, that.<br> I wish you could have<br> told me yourself.<br> Oh, Grace, it's not for long.<br> They say it'll be over by Christmas.<br> Hey.<br> No, leave me...<br> I don't want...<br> Stop it.<br> Don't be daft. Act your age.<br> I can't cope on my own.<br> I better let the children go.<br> Nice catch, Billy.<br> Billy...<br> ...before I go, there's something<br> I want to tell you.<br> You're not quite old enough, but...<br> Well...<br> It's the googly.<br> Your hand is too small to master it.<br> But you can make a start.<br> Anyway, I'm gonna pass on the secret<br> now, father to son, in case...<br> In case anything happens to me.<br> All right.<br> Now...<br> You know the leg break, right?<br> And the off break.<br> Now, the googly<br> looks like a leg break...<br> ...but it's really an off break. Got it?<br> Like this.<br> - That's like telling fibs.<br> - That's it.<br> When you tell a lie,<br> you want to get away with it.<br> But when someone else does,<br> you want to find them out.<br> A good batsman will spot a googly.<br> A good bowler will hide it.<br> Always remember that, son.<br> Bye, Grace.<br> Oh, Grace.<br> Tap's running.<br> Must go.<br> Be good.<br> - Bye-bye, Daddy.<br> - Bye, Dawn. Take care of Susie.<br> Bye, Billy.<br> Billy.<br> - Goodbye, Billy.<br> - Billy.<br> Don't forget what I told you.<br> Dad!<br> Dad!<br> Dad!<br> Bye-bye, darling.

Promise.<br> I'm gonna miss the war.<br> And it's all your fault.<br> Parents may not go<br> beyond the barriers.<br> Come on through.<br> Let's have a look at your label.<br> - I can't do it.

You thought you did.<br> We've been gypped<br> all our lives, Smiler.<br> - Take your street.<br> - What about it?<br> Rosehill Avenue:<br> No roses, no bloody hill,<br> and it's certainly not an avenue.<br> - Why not?<br> - Well, you need trees for an avenue.<br> There was talk of planting some<br> when we first came.<br> Propaganda. We've been had.<br> How's your war, Mac?<br> Never done better.<br> On the fiddle, same as everyone else.<br> - Except for servicemen.<br> - Naturally.<br> Don't understand.<br> - Is there no point to any of it?<br> - There is, all right.

Get back.<br> Home Guard coming through.<br> - Get back.<br> - Get inside.<br> Oh, leave it alone.<br> Why did they have to go and do that?<br> Not Dawn again.<br> It's Bruce.<br> What's he doing here?<br> I suppose they're still learning.<br> That's why they keep moving about.<br> - It's easy. I've done it.<br> - Who with?<br> - Pauline.<br> - Liar.<br> Mummy keeps still<br> and Daddy moves on top of her.<br> That's what they do<br> when they know how.<br> - That was some air raid.<br> - Air raid?<br> You didn't feel the house rock?<br> You must have seen<br> all those shell bursts.<br> Let's get married.<br> We can live in Montreal.<br> I could teach you French.<br> Don't get smoochy. You'll spoil it.<br> We had a week,<br> a whole wonderful week.<br> The most wonderful honeymoon<br> any couple ever had.<br> - I love you so much.<br> - Goodbye, my darling.<br> Promise you will be careful.<br> - Chin up. There's a brave girl.<br> - Lf anything should happen to you...<br> Andrew!<br> Andrew!<br> She's outgrown this.<br> Can I change it for a bigger one?<br> - Yes. Leave that one.<br> - Hello, Evelyn.<br> - Oh, hello, Grace.<br> - All right.<br> God, how I hate all this<br> scrimping and squalor.<br> I don't mind it.<br> It was harder before the war...<br> ...trying to keep up appearances.<br> Now, well, it's patriotic to be poor.<br> Well, I'm looking for something<br> with a little oomph.<br> - Don't you like it? What's wrong?<br> - I don't know how you cope.<br> Three kids, army pay, on your own...<br> You know something, Molly?<br> I like it on my own.<br> It's true.<br> I never got used to sharing my bed.<br> Not really.<br> I love a man in bed.<br> The smell of him.<br> The hairiness rubbing against you.<br> The weight of him.<br> Then when they do it to you<br> in the night...<br> ...and you're not sure if you're<br> dreaming or if it's really happening.<br> That's the best. No guilty feelings.<br> Not that I should have any<br> wide awake.<br> Molly.<br> Well...<br> ...I'm not talking about Mac.<br> He hadn't touched me for ages,<br> and not often ever.<br> My life started<br> when he went on night work.<br> You're having me on, Molly.<br> Am I?<br> - Look at this one. This is nice.<br> - Isn't that nice, yes.<br> Sorry.<br> - That's nice.<br> - I saw it first.<br> Give it to me.<br> It's not fair. It's not fair.<br> - I love pink.<br> - You're not developed enough for this.<br> Well, I am.<br> Oh, look!<br> How dare you do that?<br> Oh, Mac, that was wonderful.<br> - I haven't been to a concert since...<br> - Since I took you to the proms.<br> That's right.<br> Not since then.<br> Not since I got married.<br> Shine more brightly...<br> ...than it does now.<br> - Her eyes don't close.<br> Nor fortitude...<br> ...nor sacrifice...<br> ...nor sympathy...<br> ...nor neighbourly kindness.<br> May God...<br> ...bless you...<br> ...every...<br> ...one.<br> - He was a lot better this year.<br> - You say that every year, Dad.<br> The land and the king are one, my son.<br> If he stutters, we falter.<br> He's getting better. So are we.<br> Dad's furious.<br> It was "God Save the King. "<br> Come on, Billy.<br> - Think.<br> - Come on. First word.<br> - Choices.<br> - Second word.<br> Second word.<br> - What a lovely couple of tarts.<br> - Jam tart.<br> Yeah!<br> Time. Time for my annual toast.<br> Charge your glasses.<br> - Dadda, please. Come on, now.<br> - Oh, no. Don't, Dadda.<br> To Mary MacDonald.<br> - Thelma Richardson.<br> - Mama, please stay.<br> Bobo Hinds.<br> - Lily Sanders.<br> - George, stop it now.<br> This is my house.<br> I will not permit such behaviour.<br> Little Sarah what's...?<br> There was spirit.<br> - And Marjorie Anderson.<br> - That's enough, now. Sit down.<br> And Henry Chapman's girl.<br> Was it Thelma?<br> No.<br> I can see those cornflower eyes.<br> I've lost your name, my sweetness.<br> Do we have to listen<br> to this nonsense every year?<br> You're drunk, Dadda. Sit down.<br> Betty Browning.<br> Betty. Let me tell you something.<br> I'm 73 years old.<br> I've seen half the wonders<br> of the world.<br> And I've never laid eyes<br> on a finer sight...<br> ...than the curve<br> of Betty Browning's breasts.<br> My girls...<br> ...dead you may be,<br> or old and withered...<br> ...but while I live...<br> ...I will do you honour to the last.<br> Bless all of you.<br> Bless all of you.<br> It was Sheila, Grandpa.<br> - What's that? What's that?<br> - Henry Chapman's daughter.<br> It was Sheila,<br> I remember from last year.<br> So it was.<br> Sheila.<br> Yeah, this boy will go far.<br> Yeah, Sheila.<br> Something's wrong. What is it?<br> We're not supposed to say.<br> But we're being<br> shipped out tomorrow.<br> - Where?<br> - I don't know.<br> - You do. You're just not saying.<br> - I swear I don't know.<br> Here's your Christmas present.<br> You expect me to spend<br> the rest of the war...<br> ...sitting at home, staring at a ring.<br> And you'll meet some French girl<br> who speaks your own language.<br> Well, no, thank you.<br> Please yourself.<br> Mum!<br> - Prepare to lose.<br> - You got it.<br> - What is it, pet?<br> - For God's sake.<br> He's been posted.<br> And I was horrible to him.<br> Don't leave it like that.<br> Go after him, Dawn.<br> Come on, now. Swallow your pride.<br> What is it now?<br> We've missed them. They've gone.<br> Can't you tell me where?<br> You can see I'm not a spy.<br> I would if I could, eh?<br> But I can't.<br> - He'll write as soon as he can.<br> - Yeah, sure, he will.<br> You'll meet again.<br> Don't know where<br> Don't know when<br> In the meantime<br> I'll be free tomorrow night<br> Come on.<br> Hey.<br> Bye, Dad.<br> That letter this morning,<br> was it from Bruce?<br> What did he say?<br> He said I was right.<br> I shouldn't wait for him.<br> It was better to make a clean break.<br> Well, probably very sensible<br> under the circumstances.<br> Well, now he's gone and made me<br> fall in love with him.<br> Which I never wanted to do.<br> I told him that.<br> The ring!<br> I found the ring.<br> You needn't have bothered, Bill.<br> Gotcha!<br> - You can run quite fast, Mum.<br> - When I first met your mother...<br> ...she could stand on her hands.<br> - Really?<br> Perhaps I still can.<br> - Oh, stitch! It's ages since I have.<br> - You'll never know until you try.<br> Yes.<br> No, no, no.<br> Good.<br> What's that?<br> Big Berthas shelling France.<br> Twenty-five-mile range they've got.<br> Send a few over every day<br> just to remind them we're still here.<br> Each shell costs the price<br> of a Ford Eight.<br> - Who pays for them?<br> - We will...<br> ...you will, the rest of our lives.<br> Remember this beach, Mac?<br> All those summers.<br> Just the two families together.<br> Happy days, Grace.<br> Now there's just the two of us.<br> Thanks for today, Mac.<br> When you get bigger, Billy,<br> I'll teach you the googly.<br> Thanks.<br> There goes another Ford Eight,<br> Uncle Mac.<br> Mac, did you ever find out<br> who Molly went off with?<br> Ran off with a Polish pilot.<br> Sounds like one of those bad jokes<br> on the wireless.<br> You miss her.<br> Well, I know I do.<br> She said, " I know you love me, Mac.<br> But you never loved me enough. "<br> Not loving enough.<br> It's a terrible thing to do<br> to someone.<br> I suppose I did it to Clive.<br> I always held something back.<br> All better left unsaid, Grace.<br> You were never apart, you and Clive.<br> He kept asking and asking.<br> I kept waiting and waiting<br> for you to say something.<br> But you never did.<br> Clive had a job. I didn't.<br> I couldn't.<br> We did the decent thing, Grace.<br> This war has put an end<br> to decent things.<br> We can't change what's past.<br> Not even the war can do that.<br> Oh, we did the proper thing.<br> But we lost love.<br> And that's sad, Mac.<br> Dawn! Dawn!<br> Dawn!<br> - Mum?<br> - Grace.<br> Oh, Mum!<br> Oh, thank God you're safe.<br> Was that your house, madam?<br> - I didn't know there was an air raid.<br> - Oh, it wasn't a bomb. Just a fire.<br> What? What do you mean, a fire?<br> It happens in wartime as well,<br> you know?<br> - Will my shrapnel melt?<br> - I shouldn't think so.<br> I just wish I'd worn my nylons.<br> - My ration books are in there.<br> - Grace! No, Grace!<br> - Just a minute.<br> - Get out of my way.<br> - I want my ration books.<br> - I don't want to lose you as well.<br> Here, Grace.

A melted wireless.<br> This is my house.<br> What are you doing here?<br> Rohan...<br> - Billy. Billy, stop that.<br> - You lot, out of there now.<br> - Run.<br> - Billy. Billy, that's enough. Come on.<br> That's enough, Bill.<br> Run for it.<br> The sewing machine<br> doesn't look too bad.<br> All my lead soldiers have melted.<br> Mac. Mac, well...<br> ...some of the snaps are saved.<br> Poor things.<br> Grace.<br> This coat should fit you.<br> And here's a few bits<br> for the kitchen.<br> - Thanks ever so much, Evelyn.<br> - Look, Mum.<br> Here, Dawn. Try this.<br> What's this, then?<br> My lead soldiers.<br> They're only things.<br> We still have each other.<br> I don't care about the house.<br> I just hate all these people<br> watching us.<br> And being nice.<br> Coming!<br> Deliverance is at hand!<br> All will be well!<br> Different world, eh, Billy?<br> Not 20 miles from Piccadilly.<br> Catch the line. Pull it in.<br> Tie it up now.<br> Are you strong enough<br> for another shock?<br> You're going to be a grandma.<br> Hello, Grandma.<br> I don't believe<br> this is happening to me.<br> It's only a house.<br> And a ghastly one at that.<br> They should all be burned and bombed<br> and the builder hanged.<br> What did I do to deserve this?<br> You married that fool, Clive.<br> That's what.<br> Never mind. Never mind.<br> You can stay with us.<br> - How long?<br> - Three and a half months.<br> As long as that?<br> Well, all right. Why not?<br> It's nearly summer.<br> Let the nippers run wild.<br> Bless you, Mac.<br> - What would I have done without you?<br> - You might still have a house.<br> I wish it all<br> could have been different.<br> Take care, Grace.<br> Push off.<br> Jump in.<br> Well done, Billy.<br> All I have left in the world<br> is in this little boat.<br> Can I have a try?<br> Put your hand on mine.<br> Get the knack of it.<br> I shall teach you<br> the ways of the river.<br> Another year in that awful suburb<br> and you'd have been past saving.<br> Look. They're coming this way.<br> The future on the march.<br> I curse you, volt, watt and amp.<br> Billy. Come here. Have a listen.<br> See if you can hear anything.<br> You're freezing cold.<br> A shock like that<br> could give me a miscarriage.<br> That's an idea. Do it again.<br> Breakfast, all.<br> - Morning, Grandma.<br> - Sleep well, darling?<br> Yeah. Morning, Grandpa.<br> Did they say how long it would take<br> to get the new ration books, Grace?<br> About six weeks, I think.<br> - How are we going to cope?<br> - Nettle soup.<br> Like we did in the Great War.<br> Very nourishing.<br> Bill and I will catch fish. The river fowl<br> will be laying eggs soon.<br> We'll hunt, we'll forage,<br> we'll overcome.<br> And what about tea and sugar,<br> clever Dick?<br> Keep still. Nobody move.<br> Mother, fetch my gun.<br> - Blast the wily devil!<br> - Dadda, really.<br> Never let a rat creep up on you, Bill.<br> I think you hit him, Grandpa.<br> He was limping when he ran off.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Up, two, three.<br> Throw the pole forward.<br> Let it slide through your fingers.<br> Don't push until it hits the bottom.<br> Such nice boys...<br> ...with straw boaters and blazers.<br> And all the punts on the river lit up<br> with Chinese lanterns, like fireflies.<br> Up, two, three.<br> Throw the pole forward.<br> Let it slide through your fingers.<br> Don't push until it hits the bottom.<br> And the gramophone<br> going on one of the boats.<br> Always the Charleston.<br> - Charleston, Charleston<br> - Charleston<br> Oh, you girls.<br> Wasn't it lovely?<br> Now check that spinner.<br> No luck, Grandpa.<br> Up, two, three.<br> Now you have a go, lad.<br> Put your might and main behind it.<br> Hold it steady.<br> Now down with it. That's it.<br> Now push.<br> Sit up.<br> Two, three, four.<br> He's getting better, isn't he?<br> Let it slide through your fingers, lad.<br> Let it slide.<br> Up, two, three. Come on, now.<br> Let it slide through your fingers.<br> That's it. Now push, push.<br> - It's stuck, Grandpa.<br> - Well, pull it out, lad. Pull it out.<br> Pull it out, lad. Let it go.<br> Let it go. Stay put. Hang on.<br> Pull.<br> Now, there's a lesson for life:<br> - Never give up the punt for the pole.<br> - Oh, Billy.<br> Hello, my darlings.<br> Hello!<br> - How are you?<br> - It's so lovely to see you.<br> I'm so excited.<br> Wonderful things.<br> I was so worried.<br> - Hello.<br> - Welcome.<br> She gets bigger and bigger.<br> What about Dawn?<br> No word from Bruce, my pet?<br> All men are beasts, darling.<br> - That's what I like about them.<br> - Say hello to your Dadda.<br> - Hello, Dadda.<br> - Charity.<br> - Hello, Dadda.<br> - Hope.<br> Afternoon, Faith.<br> All hens and no cocks.<br> Too many women in our family.<br> They're a different species<br> from us, Bill.<br> Don't you love them?<br> Oh, yes, love them.<br> But don't try to understand them.<br> That road leads to ruin.<br> You said we could have<br> a game of cricket.<br> So I did. Come on.<br> I bought this one.<br> This one? But you look<br> so good in it yourself.<br> Look at the colour.<br> Do I want it?<br> You look frustrated, Faithy.<br> That husband of yours<br> still can't rise to the occasion?<br> He's a menace.<br> He ought to be locked up.<br> Don't let him get his claws<br> into Billy, Grace.<br> I won't have their husbands here.<br> All four girls married duds,<br> including your mother.<br> They'll tame you if they can,<br> cage you and feed you titbits.<br> I bat first.<br> - Come along, my dears. Tea's ready.<br> - Come on.<br> Middle and leg.<br> - Six and out in the river, Grandpa.<br> - Certainly not.<br> Yes.<br> - That was a googly.<br> - I know.<br> You're a dark horse,<br> bowling googlies at your age.<br> Toss me up another.<br> No, Grandpa. You're out.<br> It's my turn.<br> A thousand curses.<br> Ready?<br> Two.<br> Four.<br> You want to know why they're called<br> Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?<br> Six. Why?<br> Your grandmother. She named them<br> after the virtues I lack. That's marriage.<br> Eight.<br> Eight? You're damned<br> impossible, lad.<br> - Mummy, can I have the yellow cake?<br> - Yes, darling.<br> Whatever you like, my darling.<br> It's so wonderful...<br> ...to have you all here.<br> Blast you. Damnation.<br> Two.<br> Damn child.<br> Four.<br> Lost ball. Stop running.<br> It's only a game, Grandpa.<br> Six and out. Six and out.<br> Those clothes are<br> really, really good.<br> This is just like old times.<br> - Where's the fish?<br> - We got some eggs, Grandpa.<br> Never mind the eggs.<br> Catch some fish.<br> Be off with you.<br> And don't come back empty-handed...<br> ...or there's no supper.<br> Did you get a bite, Bill?<br> - No. Did you?<br> - No.<br> I'm scared to go back<br> without any fish.<br> I hate Grandpa.<br> A stray bomber.<br> German. Must've lost<br> his squadron.<br> Fish! Millions of them!<br> - This is going too far, young man.<br> - But you said, Grandpa.<br> Well, I... I'll concede I was insistent.<br> But how the devil...?<br> - Dadda, it's wonderful.<br> - It looks a bit fishy to me.<br> Could we salt them or smoke them,<br> do you think?<br> It's like the feeding of the 5000.<br> It's a miracle.<br> Well, so it's miracles now, is it?<br> They'll stink the place up<br> by morning.<br> Why don't you invite all your friends<br> round for supper, Grandpa?<br> I have no friends. Only relations.<br> Oh, Dadda.<br> Dawn!<br> Dawn! It's me.<br> Just ignore him.<br> Bill!<br> Bill.<br> Bill, will you bring<br> that canoe over here?<br> Keep going, Billy. Stick to this bank.<br> Come on!<br> Will you give me a chance<br> to explain?<br> Faster, Billy. Faster.<br> Dawn.<br> Susie.<br> I'm going to kill you, Sue Rohan.<br> Dawn.<br> I couldn't write.<br> It was secret posting.<br> I came as soon as<br> I heard about the baby.<br> Go away!<br> I've deserted.<br> I went AWOL to be with you.<br> I hate you!<br> Bruce! Bruce!<br> Bruce!<br> Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?<br> Nobody can hold<br> their breath that long.<br> No.<br> Bruce!<br> Oh, I missed you.<br> I missed you so much.<br> I missed you, baby.<br> Be careful.<br> So glad you could come.<br> Here we are. All together again.<br> - Happy as can be in the old groove.<br> - You're gonna be a grandfather, eh?<br> And I'm still just a lad myself.<br> Don't bother to grow up.<br> It's no fun at all.<br> You know, I believe<br> Elsie Drinkwater's buried here.<br> That trollop.<br> - Here, Billy.<br> - Take a snap now. Quick, quick.<br> All right, line up for<br> a photograph, everybody.<br> Smallest in the front.<br> Come on. Quick, quick.<br> - All right.<br> - Just a couple snaps.<br> Smile.<br> - Crank it forward, crank it forward.<br> - Quickly.<br> - Break it up.<br> - Bruce.<br> - Bye-bye, Bruce.<br> - Be brave.<br> - Bye.<br> - Don't worry, now.<br> Keep smiling.<br> Left. Left.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Come on, boys. Left, left.<br> "What can you do with<br> four daughters," I asked myself.<br> Four daughters.<br> A string quartet was all<br> I could come up with.<br> And they hated me<br> for making them learn.<br> And now we're glad you did.<br> Here's to music.<br> And absent friends.<br> - And absent bridegrooms.<br> - And...<br> ...the bride.<br> - The bride.<br> - The bride.<br> And... Wait for it.<br> Here's to my CO.<br> He's wangled me a posting<br> close to home.<br> He said, "Your house burns down,<br> your daughter gets married...<br> ...you're always away<br> on compassionate leave.<br> Pack up your typewriter...<br> ...fight the bloody war<br> down there. "<br> Clive.<br> I found this little bungalow<br> to rent down the towpath.<br> I never want to leave the river again.<br> The children had such<br> a wonderful summer.<br> Fair enough.<br> The river.<br> - The river.<br> - The river.<br> And loyal friends.<br> And good and faithful wives.<br> We hope and trust.<br> And grumpy grandfathers.<br> Since you're shortly to join our ranks,<br> I throw down the gauntlet.<br> A cricket match.<br> You and Mac against Bill and me.<br> On?<br> You know, Mac played<br> for Surrey seconds.<br> And I opened for the Indian Army.<br> - We've heard that a thousand times.<br> - Class will tell.<br> It's an olive branch. Take it.<br> It's the best he can do. Come on.<br> - We're putting you in to bat first.<br> - I always get the staccato wrong.<br> - No, it was me.<br> - No, it was me.<br> - All right, it was you.<br> - She's not feeling too good.<br> - Darling. Come and lie down.<br> - Poor thing.<br> Fine delivery, Billy.<br> It was a good length.<br> Turned a bit too.<br> - He'll make a good player.<br> - Give him the you-know-what.<br> All right, Grandpa.<br> - That was a googly!<br> - A googly?<br> You didn't spot it, Clive.<br> I taught him how.<br> And now he turns it against me.<br> The law of life. Cruel, isn't it?<br> - You wicked old devil.<br> - Well done, lad.<br> - I'm proud of you.<br> - Clive.<br> - Quickly, Clive!<br> - What's up?<br> - Hurry up!<br> - All right. We're coming.<br> Don't panic. Clive!<br> - What is it?<br> - Clive, fetch the doctor.<br> - Are you ill?<br> - Not me. Dawn.<br> She's in labour.<br> - Hot water. Lots of hot water.<br> - What for?<br> I don't know. They always say that<br> in the pictures.<br> Hurry.<br> - Breathe deeply.<br> - Yes, push.<br> Why? It's coming on its own.<br> It doesn't hurt.<br> - Home Doctor. It's all here. Childbirth...<br> - Oh, go away, Dadda.<br> There it is.<br> It's all sticky.<br> There it is.<br> It's a little boy.<br> It's a little boy.<br> Get out of it!<br> Go around the other way!<br> Go on, get him! Go on, get him!<br> Now, this is not the end.<br> It is not even the beginning...<br> ...of the end.<br> But it is perhaps<br> the end of the beginning.<br> I scrumped it. I nearly got caught.<br> They chased me for ages.<br> Oh, you did that for me?<br> And on the last day of your holidays.<br> Well, for the baby, really.<br> Well, thank you, Billy.<br> From the baby and me.<br> You're not that bad really,<br> are you, Billy?<br> Oh, you miserable little tripehound.<br> I'm the one who should be fed up...<br> ...sacrificing my last sup<br> of black-market petrol...<br> ...to take you to school.<br> I've gotta live in<br> Rosehill Avenue as well.<br> Only till they get you<br> into the local school.<br> With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.<br> You'll be home for the weekends.<br> Now shut up...<br> ...or walk.<br> Great, strapping fellows playing<br> silly buggers with a war on.<br> Outrageous.<br> All you do is knock the sense<br> out of them and...<br> And... And fill them up with muck!<br> Where are you going?<br> Oh, my God.<br> Not my school!<br> - Rohan! Rohan, hey!<br> - This is anarchy!<br> It was a stray bomb.<br> - Thank you, Adolf.<br> - The school has been destroyed!<br> Teachers, keep them away<br> from that fire. Teachers, fall in!<br> Get them into their lines!<br> Where's your discipline?<br> You'll all be punished!<br> This is war!<br> And it's not a laughing matter!<br> Get them into their lines!<br> Will you get into your lines!<br> Who threw that at that teacher?<br> Who threw that box? You, stop it!<br> You'll regret this.<br> Grandpa!<br> Get out. Stop that!<br> In all my life, nothing<br> ever quite matched...<br> ...the perfect joy of that moment.<br> My school lay in ruins...<br> ...and the river beck oned<br> with the promise of stolen days.<br>
