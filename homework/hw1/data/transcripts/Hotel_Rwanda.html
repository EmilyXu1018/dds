They're safe.<br> Okay.<br> But...<br> My brother and his wife--<br> did the old lady know of them?<br> My brother is dead.<br> They would never leave their children.<br> Perhaps they could not make it<br> home, Tatiana. They are hiding.<br> Please, can you return<br> and bring the girls back here to us?<br> I can't. There are<br> Interhamwe roadblocks everywhere.<br> When I reached the orphanage...<br> the Interhamwe were there.<br> They'd already started<br> killing children.<br> They made me watch.<br> There was one girl.<br> she had her little sister<br> wrapped on her back.<br> As they were about to chop her.<br> she cried out to me.<br> "Please don't let them kill me.<br> I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore,"<br> Please, I can't.<br> They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul.<br> to wipe out the next generation.<br> I've nowhere to take<br> the orphans, Paul.<br> Don't worry.

Colonel<br> and an American Embassy official.<br> And what did they say?<br> The American assured the colonel<br> that they would watch everything.<br> How? They have gone, Paul.<br> With their spies. Satellites.<br> Americans.<br> Oh, Gregoire!<br> You know, I admire you, General.<br> How do you keep command<br> of your men amid such madness?<br> - I am a strong man, Paul.<br> - I wish I were more like you.<br> - I mean, look at my staff.<br> - Cheers.<br> He won't work.<br> - He is staff?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Yes.<br> Get back to work, you slug!
