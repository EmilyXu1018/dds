                        Are you Kathy Nicolo?<br> Yeah.<br> ls this your house?<br> Nadi, of course<br> agreed that it was<br> a wonderful idea<br> to cut down the trees at our home<br> on the Caspian<br> to have the sea spread before us,<br> to reach infinity with our eyes,<br> to see forever.<br> But then,<br> our life went the way<br> of the trees,<br> when the Ayatollahs ripped the soul<br> out of our beautiful country.<br> Well, enough.<br> Today is not a day for the old.<br> lt is a day for the young.<br> To the future.<br> To our Soraya. May she be<br> a happy wife as she is a bride.<br> And perhaps<br> she will not forget her poor mother<br> and father so soon<br> and return to us and give us<br> many little grandbabies.<br> A father can dream.<br> He's so tan.<br> -Retirement's good to the coronel.<br> -He's not retired.<br> -He works for Boeing.<br> -He doesn't work for Boeing.<br> My son works for Boeing.<br> Who knows what he does now.<br> l love you.<br> -Hello?<br> -Kathy?<br> -What time is it?<br> -lt's nine o'clock.<br> Mom, that's 6 A.M. here.<br> l don't think 6 A.M.<br> will kill you.<br> Your father got up at 4:30 every day<br> of his life. God bless his soul.<br> -How's it going? How's the program?<br> -Fine.<br> l'm fine.<br> One day at a time, right?<br> l just hope it's working.<br> How is everyone there?<br> Frankie's good. Salesman of the<br> Month again. You know your brother.<br> His Lisa's in her seventh month.<br> How's your better half?.<br> Fine.<br> He's right here.<br> He's sleeping.<br> Sleeping?<br> Mom, l'm really tired.<br> l'm gonna go, okay?<br> l forgot, Aunt Frances won a trip<br> to Reno. We'll come out on the 18th.<br> l thought we'd stop by<br> to see you.<br> -The 18th?<br> -Yeah. Two weeks.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Nick will be away on business,<br> though.<br> -Again?<br> -Yeah.<br> l'm gonna go, okay?<br> You're still not smoking,<br> right?.<br> -Bye.<br> -You know it's...<br> Just a second!<br> You Kathy Lazaro?<br> Yeah. Why?<br> Kathy Lazaro, due to the nonpayment<br> of business taxes<br> associated with this property,<br> the county has petitioned the court<br> on its behalf to reclaim the costs.<br> This should come as no surprise<br> to you. l'm sure you've had<br> ample warning.<br> We've sent many notices.<br> Now the house is up for auction<br> starting tomorrow morning.<br> Auction?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Are you out of your mind?<br> There's no smoking in my house.<br> Hey, Chuck.<br> l see your number<br> right here, man.<br> Are we going to meet down there?<br> lt's supposed to be<br> a hot one today.<br> l'd dress lightly<br> if l were you.<br> That's okay,<br> because l'm not leaving.<br> l'm afraid you have no choice,<br> Mrs. Lazaro.<br> All of your things will be<br> auctioned off with the property.<br> Do you want that?<br> Look, you can't evict me.<br> l never owed a fucking business tax.<br> lt doesn't make any sense.<br> Okay. Well,<br> this is where l get off.<br> Deputy Sheriff Burdon will assist<br> you with vacating the property.<br> Do you have a lawyer?<br> l can't afford a lawyer.<br> l'm a house cleaner.<br> This is the number for the Legal<br> Assistance Office. They might help.<br> Nothing's written in blood.<br> Youjust have to clear out today.<br> You may be moving back in next week.<br> ln the meantime,<br> maybe you can call<br> some friends or family,<br> stay with them.<br> There's no one to call.<br> l tell you what.<br> l know some movers<br> that owe me a favor.<br> Brian!<br> Go down to Safeway<br> and get some boxes.<br> Let's help this lady pack up.<br> Lester.<br> May l help you?<br> My car is parked here.<br> You asked yesterday also.<br> -What happened to you?<br> -l fell.<br> -Again?<br> -Yeah.<br> Wash up. Do not get blood<br> on the floor.<br> The house was repossessed<br> for tax payment delinquency.<br> lt's got three bedrooms,<br> one bath...<br> A widow's walk<br> would increase the value.<br> What is this ''widow's walk''?<br> lt's a deck on top of the house,<br> so you can see the ocean.<br> We still got some time here.<br> Feel free to take a look around.<br> Nadereh,<br> today God has kissed our eyes.<br> Do you remember our bungalow<br> on the Caspian?<br> How l ordered the trees cut down<br> on the west side,<br> so that we may view the sea?<br> Please, be quiet.<br> You remember how the General brought<br> his family there for the New Year?<br> How beautiful it was?<br> What is the matter for you today,<br> Behrani?<br> Nadi...<br> l today have bought for us<br> another bungalow.<br> l have purchased this home for a<br> price of which no one would believe.<br> lt is worth two,<br> maybe three times that.<br> We will live in this home<br> for a short while,<br> and then sell it<br> and find one even better.<br> No, no!<br> Perhaps you did not come here<br> to live like a gypsy,<br> but l did not come here<br> to work like an Arab!<br> To be treated like an Arab.<br> For four years, we have lived a life<br> which we could not afford<br> and spent almost everything<br> to marry Soraya with a good family.<br> This apartment alone has cost us<br> over $140,000 in rent.<br> And what of Esmail's<br> university education?<br> Soon we will have nothing.<br> Then you will see what it is like<br> to walk in the shoes of the gypsies.<br> So...<br> beginning tomorrow,<br> you will begin packing.<br> There's no more to discuss, Mrs.<br> Behrani. Do not open your lips.<br> $500?<br> -They evicted you for that?<br> -You got it.<br> Are you staying with friends?<br> Yeah, l'm with a friend.<br> How much is this<br> going to cost me?<br> lt's on a sliding scale.<br> How come you didn't do something<br> about this earlier?<br> l did. l went to the courthouse<br> months ago and<br> l signed a statement saying that l<br> never owed a business tax because<br> l never owned a business.<br> l even had it certified.<br> And what about<br> the follow-up mail?<br> l didn't open them.<br> lt's very important to me that<br> l get my house back by the 18th.<br> l'm expecting company.<br> When did you sign that letter?<br> l don't know. March?<br> l hate to be the bearer of bad news,<br> but apparently the county's<br> -already sold your house.<br> -What?<br> No!<br> They can't do that.<br> The auction date<br> has been set for months.<br> Don't worry. l'll demand<br> they rescind the sale<br> or we'll file a lawsuit against<br> the county and get your house back.<br> Before the 18th, right?<br> lt's possible.<br> Fuck.<br> Hello?<br> Sorry.<br> -l didn't mean to scare you.<br> -Don't do that.<br> You all right?<br> Yeah, l'm fine. You?<br> Good, good.<br> You working undercover<br> or something?<br> Excuse me?<br> No. l'm off.<br> l drive by this way<br> and l figured<br> l'd check in on you.<br> See how you're holding up.<br> They already sold your house?<br> Technically,<br> it's mine and my brother's.<br> My dad let it to us<br> when he died.<br> l haven't told my family.<br> My lawyer is trying to get them<br> to rescind us.<br> So l'm trying not to harp<br> on the negative.<br> You have any kids, Mr. Burdon?<br> Two.<br> Call me Lester.<br> My husband left me<br> eight months ago.<br> No one knows that, either.<br> Do you mind if l give you<br> some professional advice?<br> No.<br> Do it all through your lawyer,<br> Kathy.<br> l wouldn't even drive past that<br> house till the keys are in my hand.<br> Thanks for checking in on me.<br> Sure.<br> Night.<br> Kathy, wait.<br> This is my direct number<br> at the department.<br> Most of the time l'm on patrol,<br> but if you ever need anything,<br> anything at all,<br> just leave a message.<br> See you.<br> Good night.<br> lt is like<br> our garden in lsfahan.<br> Hello?<br> Hello?<br> Yeah?<br> Your credit card didn't go through.<br> That's two days now.<br> God, l'm really sorry about that.<br> Look, l'm going to get<br> my paycheck on Friday.<br> ls there any way we can just<br> let it slide until then?<br> The only affordable way<br> to put a terrace up there<br> is to put the stairs<br> on the outside.<br> lt will have to block<br> that kitchen window.<br> l could do that for about a grand.<br> lf we have to go through the roof,<br> you're talking four to seven.<br> -But this window must be obstructed?<br> -l don't see any other way.<br> That is acceptable.<br> Can you start today?<br> What are you doing?<br> -Excuse me?<br> -What the fuck are you doing?<br> This is my house!<br> -Who are you?<br> -Who said you could do this?<br> Are you Mrs. Behrani?<br> No.<br> Mr. Behrani hired us.<br> You'll have to talk to him.<br> Fuck!<br> Shit!<br> Damn!<br> Stay right there!<br> Don't move!<br> Oh, man!<br> Careful.<br> Can we use your bathroom?<br> She stepped on a nail.<br> Sorry, ma'am.<br> Could we use your washroom<br> to clean her foot?<br> lt is okay.<br> For one moment, please.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks.<br> Have you had<br> a tetanus shot lately?<br> l'm going to be sick.<br> ls she bleeding?<br> Excuse me.<br> l don't want to ruin<br> your towel.<br> Here. l use this<br> for skateboarding.<br> Don't worry.<br> l washed it.<br> Okay.<br> This is, of course,<br> our family pictures.<br> Thank you.<br> l think l should go.<br> What happened?<br> l'll tell you what happened.<br> My yard is a construction site.<br> -You were there?<br> -Yeah.<br> l was there.<br> l was at my house.<br> l stepped on some nails.<br> l was bleeding on my own doorstep,<br> waiting for a stranger to let me in.<br> You can't just go over there.<br> Let us handle this.<br> l want them out of my house.<br> They're already more at home there<br> than l ever was.<br> Did you get their name?<br> Bahroony?<br> Behmini, something like that. l<br> don't know. They're Middle Eastern.<br> -Gary.<br> -Yes. Connie?<br> Type a letter to the courier service<br> and get it to a Mr. Behrmini.<br> lt's damn hard<br> to sell a house nowadays.<br> This is what you call<br> a real buyer's market.<br> Sorry, but she comes in at<br> $174,000.<br> -You're late, Behrani.<br> -l'm not late.<br> l have come to tell you that l am<br> no longer to return to this job.<br> You tell the office, Colonel?<br> No.<br> So why tell me?<br> ls this you?<br> ''...inform you<br> that under these circumstances...<br> we request that you vacate<br> the property immediately.''<br> Mother whores!<br> goddamn it!<br> Mr. Barmeeny is here.<br> Mr. Barmeeny...<br> My name is Behrani.<br> Colonel Massoud<br> Amir Behrani.<br> l wish to speak with Mr. Walsh,<br> please.<br> l'm Connie Walsh.<br> This is my office, Colonel.<br> Please come in.<br> l'm sure our letter<br> came as a shock to you.<br> The situation is this:<br> Pacific County has made<br> a number of mistakes.<br> First, they levied a tax on my<br> client, which she did not owe.<br> Second, they evicted her<br> for nonpayment.<br> Third, they auctioned<br> the property.<br> -And this is where you come in.<br> -But l now own the house.<br> l paid for it in cash.<br> l have a bill of sale.<br> Here, please.<br> Would you be willing to sell<br> the county back the house?<br> l can assure you they would make it<br> a comfortable transaction.<br> Please listen to me very carefully,<br> Miss Walsh.<br> The only comfortable<br> transaction possible<br> is if the county tax office<br> paid to me $174,000.<br> Mr. Behrani, you only paid<br> a quarter of that amount.<br> The market can already<br> pay me this.<br> good morning, Miss Walsh.<br> Wait, please.<br> From a legal standpoint,<br> you are in the right.<br> But the true owner of this house<br> is living in a motel.<br> Her belongings are locked in<br> storage. Why should she wait<br> to get back into her home that<br> was wrongfully taken from her?<br> Just because you want<br> to turn a profit?<br> Things are not as they appear.<br> lt is a matter of necessity<br> for me and my family.<br> l'm sorry.<br> l do not have a choice<br> in this matter.<br> Hi.<br> This is a surprise.<br> Good one or bad one?<br> lt's good. lt's good.<br> What happened to your foot?<br> l stopped by my house, and they were<br> doing some construction on the roof.<br> -l stepped on some nails.<br> -Thanks for letting me ride along<br> today, Mr. Burdon.<br> -So, how's the El Rancho?<br> -l'm not there anymore.<br> l'm staying at<br> the Bonneville now.<br> l don't know it.<br> You're looking at it.<br> l haven't had a drink<br> in three years, Lester.<br> l'm sorry. l should have asked.<br> l didn't know.<br> lt's okay.<br> The fog is coming in.<br> l'd like to ask you<br> a personal question if l could.<br> Okay.<br> Just get it over with.<br> Why is your husband<br> no longer with you?<br> l wanted kids.<br> He didn't want kids.<br> But l guess if he really wanted me,<br> he would have wanted them, too.<br> l think he's a fool.<br> Maybe we should find you<br> a place to stay.<br> Do you remember the beauty<br> of the Caspian Sea, Esmail?<br> The water like glass,<br> the beach sand like gold.<br> lt is beautiful here.<br> Massoud, when must we<br> move again?<br> Not too soon.<br> Perhaps once we get a buyer, we will<br> tell them to wait until autumn.<br> Would you prefer that?<br> l will do as you wish.<br> There was this<br> little runt of a guy.<br> Kept beating up his wife.
