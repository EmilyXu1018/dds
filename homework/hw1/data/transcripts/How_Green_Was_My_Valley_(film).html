                        I am packing my belongings in the shawl<br> my mother used to wear to the market,<br> and I am going from my valley.<br> And this time I shall never return.<br> I am leaving behind me<br> my 50 years of memory.<br> Memory.<br> Strange that the mind will forget so much<br> of what only this moment is passed,<br> and yet hold clear and bright<br> the memory of what happened years ago,<br> of men and women long since dead.<br> Yet who shall say<br> what is real and what is not?<br> Can I believe my friends all gone,<br> when their voices are still a glory in my ears?<br> No. And I will stand to say no and no again,<br> for they remain a living truth within my mind.<br> There is no fence nor hedge<br> around time that is gone.<br> You can go back and have what<br> you like of it, if you can remember.<br> So I can close my eyes on my valley<br> as it is today and it is gone,<br> and I see it as it was when I was a boy.<br> Green it was, and possessed<br> of the plenty of the earth.<br> In all Wales, there was none so beautiful.<br> Everything I ever learnt as<br> a small boy came from my father,<br> and I never found anything he ever told me<br> to be wrong or worthless.<br> The simple lessons he taught me<br> are as sharp and clear in my mind<br> as if I had heard them only yesterday.<br> In those days, the black slag,<br> the waste of the coal pits,<br> had only begun to cover the side of our hill,<br> not yet enough to mar the countryside,<br> nor blacken the beauty of our village.<br> For the colliery had only begun to poke<br> its skinny black fingers through the green.<br> I can hear even now<br> the voice of my sister Angharad.<br> Huw!<br> Angharad!<br> Coal miners were my father<br> and all my brothers, and proud of their trade.<br> - Gwilym Morgan, three pounds seven.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Lanto Morgan, three pounds seven.<br> Ivor Morgan, three pounds seven.<br> Davy Morgan, two pounds five.<br> Owen Morgan, two pounds five.<br> Young Gwilym Morgan, one pound ten.<br> Someone would strike up a song,<br> and the valley would ring<br> with the sound of many voices.<br> For singing is in my people<br> as sight is in the eye.<br> Then came the scrubbing,<br> out in the back yard.<br> It was the duty of my sister Angharad<br> to bring the buckets of hot water and cold,<br> and I performed what little tasks I could<br> as my father and brothers<br> scrubbed the coal dust from their backs.<br> Most would come off them,<br> but some would stay for life.<br> It is the honourable badge of the coal miner,<br> and I envied it<br> on my father and grown-up brothers.<br> Scrub and scrub,<br> Mr Coal would lie there and laugh at you.<br> There was always a baron of beef or<br> a shoulder or leg of lamb before my father.<br> There was never any talk<br> while we were eating.<br> I never met anybody<br> whose talk was better than good food.<br> My mother was always on the run,<br> always the last to start her dinner,<br> and the first to finish.<br> For if my father was the head of our house,<br> my mother was its heart.<br> After the dishes had been washed,<br> the box was brought to the table<br> for the spending money to be handed out.<br> No one in our valley had ever seen a bank.<br> We kept our savings on the mantelpiece.<br> My father used to say<br> that money was made to be spent,<br> just as men spend<br> their strength and brains in earning it,<br> and as willingly.<br> But always with a purpose.<br> Thank you, Dadda.<br> Out of the house and across the street,<br> as I had run a hundred times before.<br> Softly now, for respect for chapel<br> was the first thing my father taught us.<br> Then straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop,<br> for that toffee which you could<br> chew for hours, it seems to me now.<br> And even after it had gone down,<br> you could swallow<br> and still find the taste of it<br> hiding behind your tongue.<br> It is with me now, so many years later.<br> It makes me think of so much<br> that was good that is gone.<br> It was on this afternoon<br> that I first saw Bron - Bronwyn.<br> She had come over from the next valley<br> for her first call on my father and mother.<br> Is this Gwilym Morgan's house?<br> You must be Huw.<br> - Is that you, Bronwyn?<br> - Yes.<br> There's lovely you are.<br> I think I fell in love with Bronwyn then.<br> Perhaps it is foolish to think a child could<br> fall in love, but I am the child that was,<br> and nobody knows how I felt, except only me.<br> - I'm so proud for lvor.<br> - I'm the one to be proud.<br> You think well of our lvor?<br> It seems only a few months<br> since he was scratching around here<br> like this one, with his mouth open.<br> This is Bronwyn, Huw,<br> who's to be your sister.<br> We have met already.<br> Be careful of the basket.<br> There's shortcake in it.<br> This is not for you. You will have<br> your time to come. Run along now.<br> Bronwyn and lvor were to be married<br> by the new preacher, Mr Gruffydd,<br> who had come from the university at Cardiff.<br> This was my first sight of him.<br> # Now here's a man won't get drunk,<br> can't get drunk, shan't get drunk<br> # Here's a man won't get drunk, Peter O'Pea<br> # From my heel to my toe,<br> from my toe to my knee<br> # I'll walk the line, chalk the line, Peter O'Pea<br> - Good evening, Mr Morgan.<br> - Yes, indeed, sir.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - Thank you.<br> Come now, boys. Back to work.<br> Ivor, find Dai Griffiths and Idris John<br> and bring them to Mr Evans' office.<br> - Will we come with you?<br> - No. This is a matter for the older men.<br> - Home to your mother.<br> - But...<br> Leave it now, Davy.<br> Well, come.<br> - Why aren't you washed?<br> - We were waiting for you.<br> The cut is only a few shillings.<br> There will still be plenty for us.<br> A bit of supper now, is it, girl?<br> It is because they are not<br> getting the old price for coal.<br> - Come and wash now.<br> - May we speak first, sir?<br> - Yes.<br> - They did not give you the real reason.<br> We've been expecting it since<br> the ironworks at Dowlais closed down.<br> What have the ironworks to do with us?<br> The men from Dowlais will work for any<br> wage, so all our wages must come down.<br> And this is only the beginning. Watch now.<br> They will cut us again and still again, until<br> they have this as empty as their promises.<br> - A good worker is worth good wages.<br> - Not while there are three men for every job.<br> Why should the owners pay more<br> if men will work for less?<br> Because the owners are not savages.<br> They are men too, like us.<br> Men, yes, but not like us.<br> Would they deal with you just now, sir,<br> when you went to them?<br> - No.<br> - Because they have power and we have none.<br> - How will we get power, then? From the air?<br> - No. From a union of all the men.<br> Union, is it? I never thought I'd hear<br> my own sons talking socialist nonsense.<br> - It's good sense.<br> - Unless we stand together...<br> - I've had enough of this talk.<br> - But, Father, it does...<br> Come and wash now.<br> Your good mother will be waiting.<br> Do you think I'll let them make you stand<br> in the rain and not raise my hands to stop it?<br> Hush, Davy.<br> - Who gave you permission to speak?<br> - It is too important for silence.<br> - They're trying to punish you because...<br> - It is not more important than good manners.<br> But what are we going to do about it?<br> You'll die of cold when it comes to snow.<br> Let us stand together<br> and see how they act then.<br> Right. The men will come out<br> if we say the word.<br> All the pits are ready.<br> You'll not make me a plank for your politics.<br> I will not be the excuse for any strike.<br> But if they do that to the spokesman,<br> what will they try and do to the men?<br> We will see.<br> Be silent now. Finish your supper.<br> - Father...<br> - Enough now.<br> - But...<br> - On with your work.<br> - It is not enough.<br> - Wait until you have permission to speak.<br> I will speak against injustice anywhere,<br> with permission or without it.<br> - Not in this house.<br> - In this house and outside, sir.<br> - Leave the table.<br> - I will leave the house.<br> - Tell your father you're sorry.<br> - I'm not sorry.<br> I'm with you. We can find<br> lodgings in the village.<br> Gwilym.<br> All of you, then?<br> For the last time, sit down,<br> finish your supper. I will say no more.<br> We are not questioning your authority, sir.<br> But if manners prevent our speaking<br> the truth, we will be without manners.<br> Get your clothes and go.<br> - I'm going with them to look after them.<br> - Hold your tongue. Get on with your dishes.<br> Yes, my son, I know you are there.<br> The men have struck.<br> What does it mean, Mr Gruffydd?<br> It means that...<br> something has gone out of this valley<br> that may never be replaced.<br> Home to your father and mother, boy.<br> They'll need you today.<br> Twenty-two weeks the men were out<br> as the strike moved into winter.<br> It was strange to go out into the street<br> and find the men there in the daytime.<br> It had a feeling of fright in it.<br> And always the mood of the men grew uglier,<br> as empty bellies and desperation<br> began to conquer reason.<br> Any man who was not their friend<br> became their enemy.<br> They knew that my father<br> had opposed the strike,<br> and now it was they who opposed him.<br> Huw, there's a meeting of the men<br> in the hills tonight, is it?<br> - Yes, Momma.<br> - You will take me.<br> No, Momma. It is no place for women.<br> There is a place for this woman<br> there tonight... upon my soul.<br> Wait. Wait till you hear me.<br> I am Beth Morgan, as you damn well know.<br> I have come to tell you what I think of you,<br> because you are talking against my husband.<br> You're a lot of cowards to go against him.<br> He would do nothing against you<br> and he never has, and you know him well.<br> How you smug-faced hypocrites can sit<br> in the same chapel with him, I cannot tell.<br> To say he is with the owners is not<br> only nonsense, but downright wickedness.<br> There's one thing more<br> I've got to say, and it is this.<br> If harm comes to my Gwilym,<br> I'll find out the men<br> and I will kill them with my two hands.<br> And this I will swear by God Almighty.<br> Lanto! Help!<br> Hold on, Momma.<br> They've heard us. They're coming.<br> He was awake just now.<br> He'll do, then. But it's beyond me to say why.<br> You're breeding horses<br> in this family, Mr Morgan.<br> This boy should be in his coffin, for my part.<br> He's a Morgan then, is it, sir?<br> He should be fed now, Mrs lvor.<br> A little soup...<br> and some warm smiles.<br> Horse.<br> - Good day. Wait, wait, wait.<br> - Huw was awake just now. He spoke to Bron.<br> - How long then for the little one?<br> - It's hard to tell.<br> His legs were frozen to the bone.<br> A year, two years, quiet like that.<br> But I can't promise that he'll ever walk again.<br> Nature must take her course. Gee up.<br> Mind your tongue. I think he heard you.<br> Where is the light<br> I thought to see in your eye?<br> Are you afraid, boy?<br> - You heard what the doctor said?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And you believed it?<br> Yes, sir.<br> You want to walk again, don't you?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then you must have faith.<br> And if you have, you will walk again,<br> no matter what all the doctors say.<br> But he said nature must take her course.<br> Nature is the handmaiden of the Lord.<br> I remember one or two occasions when<br> she was given orders to change her course.<br> - You know your scriptures, boy.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Then you know that what's been<br> done before can be done again, for you.<br> Do you believe me, Huw?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Good.<br> You will see the first daffodil,<br> out on the mountain.<br> - Will you?<br> - Indeed I will, sir.<br> Then you will.<br> I could almost wish<br> that I were lying there in your place<br> if it meant reading<br> this book again for the first time.<br> Treasure Island.<br> Mr Gruffydd?<br> - I couldn't let you go without thanking you.<br> - It was only my duty, girl.<br> No. It was more than duty.<br> Yes. Huw's a fine boy.<br> And you're a fine family.<br> You'd better be going in now.<br> You'll catch your death.<br> Will you be coming to supper soon?<br> Yes. Later, when you're finished<br> with doctors and such.<br> - I will hurry them away, then.<br> - Good.<br> "Squire Trelawney, Dr Livesey,<br> and the rest of these gentlemen<br> having asked me to write down the<br> whole particulars about Treasure Island<br> from the beginning to the end, keeping<br> nothing back but the bearings of the island,<br> and only because there is<br> still treasure not yet lifted,<br> I take up my pen in the year of grace 1785,<br> and go back to the time when<br> my father kept the 'Admiral Benbow' inn."<br> All the noble books which have<br> lived in my mind ever since,<br> and always I hoped, and kept my faith.<br> For the first months<br> my mother was still upstairs,<br> and we could talk to each other with tappings.<br> Spring?<br> There you are, girl.<br> Easy.<br> There.<br> Wait.<br> It's the old snow got into it.<br> Gwilym.<br> There is a wife you have, resting in her bed<br> and letting strangers care for her family.<br> There is a wife I have, then.<br> Go along with you, boy.<br> Will you say something, Mother?<br> Go on, say something.<br> What can I say?<br> You found plenty to say last time you spoke.<br> It should be easier now, with friends.<br> Well...<br> Well... Come and eat, everyone.<br> More, is it, boys?<br> Lanto.<br> I haven't seen you in chapel lately.<br> - I have been too busy.<br> - What business, may I ask?<br> - Mine.<br> - Only asking a civil question, I was.<br> And having a civil answer.<br> I have been busy with the union.<br> Unions are the work of the Devil.<br> You will come to no good end.<br> At least I am not sitting on it,<br> talking rubbish in chapel.<br> - Look here...<br> - Leave it, or I'll say something to be sorry.<br> This is a matter that requires airing.<br> Lanto, why do you think<br> we at the chapel talk rubbish?<br> My remark was not aimed at you.<br> Then aim it.<br> Very well.<br> Because you make yourselves out<br> to be shepherds of the flock,<br> and yet you allow your sheep<br> to live in filth and poverty.<br> And if they try and raise<br> their voices against it,<br> you calm them by telling them<br> their suffering is the will of God.<br> Sheep, indeed. Are we sheep to be herded<br> and sheared by a handful of owners?<br> I was taught man was made<br> in the image of God, not a sheep.<br> - Lanto.<br> - I haven't expressed my views<br> because I haven't had any wish<br> to interfere in a family disagreement.<br> You have my permission to speak.<br> Very well, then. Here is what I think.<br> First, have your union.<br> You need it. Alone, you are weak.<br> Together, you are strong.<br> But remember that with strength goes<br> responsibility, to others and yourselves.<br> For you cannot conquer injustice<br> with more injustice,<br> only with justice, and the help of God.<br> Are you coming outside<br> your position in life, Mr Gruffydd?<br> Your business is spiritual.<br> My business is anything<br> between man and the spirit of God.<br> The deacons shall hear that<br> you have been preaching socialism.<br> - Mr Parry...<br> - Loose the old devil.<br> - Mr Parry...<br> - Stop now. He is our guest.<br> - Beth, a pint of home-brew for Mr Parry.<br> - I'll give him a clout with the frying pan.<br> Miss Jenkins. A sweet song. The harp, is it?<br> Come on, men. Get in here.<br> Now look, a little song...<br> Angharad.<br> Mr Gruffydd, will we always be in your debt?<br> Now you have made us a family again.<br> Here. Let me.<br> Your hands. There's a pity.<br> No matter.<br> Have you ever been down the collieries?<br> - Ten years.<br> - Ten years?<br> While I was studying.<br> - A bit of soap now.<br> - Don't bother, please.<br> There's a man for you,<br> spoiling his good handkerchief.<br> Look now, you are king in the chapel,<br> but I will be queen in my own kitchen.<br> You will be queen wherever you walk.<br> What does that mean?<br> I should not have said it.<br> Why?<br> I have no right to speak to you so.<br> Mr Gruffydd?<br> If the right is mine to give,<br> you have it.<br> Then the strike was settled,<br> with the help of Mr Gruffydd and my father.<br> Work again, work to wipe out<br> the memory of idleness and hardship.<br> The men were happy<br> going up the hill that morning.<br> - One and nine.<br> - One and ten.<br> But not all of them, for there were<br> too many now for the jobs open,<br> and some learned that never again would<br> there be work for them in their own valley.<br> It is the same all over South Wales, it is.<br> Father, in Cardiff the men are standing<br> in line to have bread from the government.<br> Not for us, eh, lad?<br> We will have our share of the box<br> and go, if you please, sir.<br> - Where will you go?<br> - America.<br> - My share too, Owen.<br> - And mine.<br> No. Our own.<br> - We will take no charity.<br> - Not charity, man. Sense.<br> No, only our own.<br> Say nothing of this to your mother.<br> Let this day be over first.<br> Never mind saying nothing.<br> I heard.<br> America.<br> My babies.<br> Shall we have a chapter, my sons?<br> What shall we have, sir?<br> Isaiah 55.<br> Those two gone. This is only the beginning.<br> Then all of you will go,<br> one after the other. All of you.<br> I will never leave you, Momma.<br> Huw, boy, if you should ever leave me,<br> I'll be sorry I ever had babies.<br> Why did you have them?<br> Indeed to goodness, boy, why?<br> To keep my hands in water<br> and my face to the fire, perhaps.<br> For Mr lvor Morgan.<br> From Windsor Castle it is.<br> "Mr lvor Morgan is commanded<br> to appear before Her Maj..."<br> "Mr lvor Morgan is commanded to appear<br> before Her Majesty at Windsor Castle,<br> with chosen members of his choir, on 14<br> May between the hours of three and five."<br> To sing before the Queen.<br> My son, I never thought<br> to see this beautiful day.<br> Idris, Owen, all of you.<br> Fetch everyone from all the valleys round.<br> Davy, over to the other collieries.<br> Invite everyone.<br> Lanto, down to the Three Bells for beer.<br> Open house tonight for all who will come.<br> My sons, you shall have<br> a sendoff worthy of the Morgans.<br> Our Heavenly Father, I give thanks<br> from the heart to live this day.<br> I give thanks for all I have,<br> and I do give thanks for this new blessing.<br> For you are our Father,<br> but we look to our Queen as our mother.<br> Comfort her in her troubles, O God,<br> and let her worries be<br> not more than she shall bear at her age.<br> And grant that sweetness<br> and power and spirit<br> may be given to these voices<br> that shall sing at her command.<br> - Amen.<br> - Amen.<br> # God save our gracious Queen<br> # Long live our noble Queen<br> # God save our Queen<br> # Send her victorious<br> # Happy and glorious<br> Gwilym. Owen.<br> # Long to reign over us<br> # God save our Queen<br> Good morning, Mr Gruffydd.<br> Angharad is down to the market.<br> Angharad? I've come for Huw.<br> For Huw?<br> - The daffodils are out, Momma.<br> - Where are your clothes?<br> Under my pillow.<br> For these months, ready for today.<br> Come you, then, and you shall<br> bring back a posy fit for a queen<br> for your brave mother.<br> Indeed I will, sir.<br> - Almost there, Huw.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Low bridge there. Watch out.<br> - It's fun.<br> - All right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - All right?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Easy it is, now.<br> There.<br> Cwm Rhondda.<br> You can walk, Huw, if you try.<br> Come, lad. You can walk.<br> Huw. Walk.<br> There's a good lad. Come on.<br> See?<br> There's a good old man.<br> You've been lucky, Huw.<br> Lucky to suffer, and lucky to<br> spend these weary months in bed.<br> For so God has given you a chance<br> to make spirit within yourself.<br> And as your father cleans<br> his lamp to have good light,<br> so keep clean your spirit, huh?<br> How, sir?<br> By prayer, Huw.<br> And by prayer I don't mean<br> shouting and mumbling,<br> and wallowing like a hog<br> in religious sentiment.<br> Prayer is only another name<br> for good, clean, direct thinking.<br> When you pray, think.<br> Think well what you're saying.<br> Make your thoughts into things that are solid,<br> and in that way<br> your prayer will have strength.<br> And that strength will become<br> a part of you, body, mind and spirit.<br> And the first duty of these new legs<br> is to get you to chapel on Sunday.<br> - Indeed they will, sir.<br> - There's a good old man again.<br> Give me your hand.<br> Come on, now.<br> Will you please remain in your places?<br> There's to be a meeting of the deacons.<br> Meillyn Lewis.<br> Step forward.<br> Your sins have found you out.<br> And now you must pay the price<br> of all women like you.<br> You have brought a child into the world<br> against the commandment.<br> Prayer is wasted on your sort.<br> You shall be cast out into the utter darkness<br> till you have learned your lesson.<br> Meillyn Lewis, do you admit your sin?<br> Yes.<br> Then prepare to suffer your punishment.<br> Stop it. Leave her alone, you hypocrite.<br> - Leave it now, Mr Morgan.<br> - Sit down.<br> Angharad.<br> How could you watch them? Cruel old men,<br> groaning and nodding to hurt her more.<br> That is not the word of God.<br> "Go thou and sin no more," Jesus said.<br> Angharad.<br> - You know your Bible too well, life too little.<br> - I know Meillyn Lewis is no worse than I am.<br> - Angharad.<br> - What do the deacons know about it?<br> What do you know about what<br> could happen to a poor girl when...<br> when she loves a man so much that even to<br> lose sight of him for a moment is torture?<br> - Does it hurt you, Huw?<br> - Easy, now.<br> Huw?<br> Angharad.<br> I am a man now. Kindly leave the kitchen.<br> So you're a man now, is it?<br> Beth. Blasphemy, sacrilege and hypocrisy.<br> Can't a man smoke<br> and read a paper on the Sabbath?<br> Go and blow your nose.<br> Come in.<br> Come in.<br> What under the blazes...<br> - Good morning, Morgan.<br> - Good morning, Mr Evans.<br> - Sit down, sir. Sit down, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr Evans.<br> The mine owner himself.<br> Angharad.<br> - Now to business.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I've come here on<br> a very delicate mission, Morgan.<br> - No trouble, sir?<br> - No. No trouble.<br> - But it worries me.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm here to get your permission<br> that my son lestyn<br> may have permission...<br> - Bless you, Morgan.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> - Now where was I?<br> - "Permission"?<br> Yes. That my son lestyn<br> may have permission,<br> with your daughter's permission,<br> to call upon her. There we are.<br> We are a very proud family, Mr Evans.<br> Yes, I know. I know, Morgan.<br> But this is not my doing, Morgan.<br> It's that young whelp of a...<br> Mr Evans. Your son has<br> my permission to speak to me.<br> Thank you, Morgan.<br> I'm very much obliged to you.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Good old Welsh blood, you know,<br> and all that sort of thing.<br> - I'm very much obliged, Morgan.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Beth.<br> Come, come, come. My shoes. Get my shoes.<br> You, girl. Get up to your room. Have you<br> no modesty left in you? Get up there.<br> Get your hands out...<br> My shoes. Find the shoes.<br> Why don't you get yourjackets on?<br> Mr Morgan?<br> Sit down.<br> This is my wife, Mrs Morgan.<br> How do you do?<br> Mr Morgan, I've come to ask your permission<br> to speak to your daughter, Angharad.<br> These are my sons.<br> Yes. I know them.<br> God bless you.<br> You shouldn't be here.<br> I couldn't spend<br> another night without knowing.<br> What has happened? Is anything wrong?<br> - Wrong?<br> - You know what I mean.<br> Why have you changed towards me?<br> Why am I a stranger now?<br> Have I done anything?<br> No.<br> The blame is mine.<br> Your mother spoke to me after chapel.<br> She's happy to think<br> you'll be having plenty all of your days.<br> With lestyn Evans.<br> - You could do no better.<br> - I don't want him.<br> I want you.<br> Angharad?<br> I have spent nights too,<br> trying to think this out.<br> When I took up this work,<br> I knew what it meant.<br> It meant sacrifice and devotion.<br> It meant making it my whole life to the...<br> to the exclusion of everything else.<br> That I was perfectly willing to do.<br> But to share it with another...<br> Do you think I will<br> have you going threadbare,<br> depending on the charity<br> of others for your good meals?<br> Our children growing up in cast-off clothing,<br> and ourselves thanking God for<br> parenthood in a house full of bits?<br> No. I can bear with such a life<br> for the sake of my work,<br> but I think I'd start to kill if...<br> if I saw the white come to your hair<br> Why?<br> Why would you start to kill?<br> Are you a man or a saint?<br> I am no saint. But I have a duty towards you.<br> Let me do it.<br> Is there to be no singing for<br> my daughter's wedding, Dai Bando?<br> Now then. The bathtub holds 100 gallons.<br> "A" fills it at the rate of 20 gallons a minute,<br> and "B" at the rate of ten gallons a minute.<br> - Got that, Mr Morgan?<br> - Twenty and ten gallons. Yes, sir.<br> Now then. "C" is a hole that empties it<br> at the rate of five gallons a minute.<br> How long to fill the tub?<br> There is silly. Trying to fill<br> a bathtub full of holes, indeed.<br> A sum it is, girl. A sum.<br> A problem for the mind.<br> - For his examination into school.<br> - That old national school.<br> 'Tis silly they are with their sums. Who<br> would pour water in a bathtub full of holes?<br> - Who would think of it? Only a madman.<br> - It is to see if the boy can calculate.<br> Figures, nothing else.<br> How many gallons, and how long.<br> In a bathtub full of holes.<br> Now I know why I have such a tribe of sons.<br> It is you, Beth Morgan, is the cause.<br> Look you, Mr Gruffydd.<br> Have you something else?<br> The decimal point.<br> The decimal...<br> The decimal point, then,<br> and peace to my house.<br> - Go and scratch.<br> - Well, it's getting late.<br> I've got to get along. We'll follow<br> the decimal point tomorrow night.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night, Mrs Morgan.<br> Who is there that cannot look back<br> and remember his first day at a new school?<br> To go alone the long walk<br> over the hills to the next valley,<br> the first of my family to have<br> the privilege of attending a national school.<br> So you're the new boy?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - You're late.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What a dirty little sweep it is.<br> Who are your people?<br> - Where are you from?<br> - Cwm Rhondda.<br> Cwm Rhondda?<br> A little genius from the coal pits.<br> And they expect me to make<br> a scholar of it. All right, come in.<br> Were you brought up in stables?<br> Well, shut the door.<br> Your boots are muddy.<br> They were clean when I left home.<br> You will address me as "sir",<br> or I'll put a stick about your back.<br> - Now sit down here.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Come here, you dirty little sweep.<br> What have we here?<br> A pencil box.<br> Pretty, too.<br> You broke my pencil box.<br> Mervyn, stop it. You'll hurt him.<br> I fell on the mountain.<br> Did you win, Huw?<br> No.<br> Lanto.<br> - Fetch Dai Bando.<br> - Dai Bando, is it?<br> - Are you willing to go to school tomorrow?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Good. You shall get a penny for every mark<br> on your face, sixpence for a bloody nose,<br> a shilling for a black eye,<br> two shillings for a broken nose.<br> Gwilym. Stop it. Fight again,<br> and when you come home, not a look<br> will you get from me, not a word.<br> Break your own nose, then. Break my heart<br> every time you go out of the house.<br> - A boy must fight, Beth.<br> - Fight?<br> Fight? Another beating like that,<br> he will walk home dead.<br> Beating? He's had no beating.<br> A hiding, yes, but no beating.<br> Give the boy time, it will be he<br> that's giving the beating, is it?<br> Dai Bando. Come into the house.<br> - Good evening, Mrs Morgan.<br> - Leave off your hat.<br> Dai Bando is going to teach you to box, Huw.<br> To fight first. Too many call themselves<br> boxers who are not even fighters.<br> - Boxing is an art, is it?<br> - It is, it is.<br> Go along with you, girl.<br> A cup of tea for the men.<br> - Tea?<br> - Tea?<br> No tea, Mrs Morgan.<br> In training, he is.<br> A glass of beer, if you please.<br> Baths full of holes.<br> And now prizefighters.<br> So our little coal miner has been<br> indulging in his favourite sport again?<br> - Mr Phillips, make a back. Make a back.<br> - I refuse, sir.<br> Mr Wells, make a back.<br> Here. Put this in between your teeth.<br> Bite it hard.<br> Well, the scholar.<br> - Huw, lad.<br> - Well, I will go to my death.<br> - Did you get that in school?<br> - He has cut you to the bone. Who was it?<br> - Mr Jonas, is it?<br> - We'll have a word with Mr Jonas.<br> - No.<br> - And why not?<br> - I broke the rule when I fought.<br> - There is no rule for that.<br> - But he warned me.<br> - Rubbish, boy. I'll...<br> Hush, Davy.<br> This is Huw's affair. He shall decide.<br> Say the word, lad, and we will<br> have the bones hot from his flesh.<br> No. Leave him alone.<br> I think our baby brother<br> is becoming quite a man.<br> These denominations are used<br> in measuring distances and...<br> - Yes?<br> - Right.<br> - Good morning, Mr...<br> - Jonas.<br> Mr Jonas. We have come<br> to the right place indeed.<br> What can I do for you?<br> A man is never too old to learn,<br> is it, Mr Jonas?<br> - No.<br> - I was in school myself once.<br> - But no great one for knowledge.<br> - Look here, what do you want?<br> Knowledge.<br> How would you go about taking<br> the measurement of a stick, Mr Jonas?<br> - By its length, of course.<br> - And how would you measure a man<br> who would use a stick on a boy<br> one third his size?<br> - Tell us.<br> - Now, you are good in the use of a stick.<br> But boxing is my subject, to the rules laid<br> down by the good Marquess of Queensberry.<br> God rest his soul.<br> And happy I am to pass on<br> my knowledge to you.<br> Mr Mottshill. Mr Mottshill.<br> All right, get him into position, now.<br> Look, to make a good boxer,<br> you must have a good right hand.<br> You see?<br> Now, that is how you will punish your man,<br> with a right and a left.<br> And put your soul into it, with...<br> The gentleman is talking to you.<br> - Raise him up.<br> - Come, come, come. Up, up, up.<br> Position again.<br> Could I have your attention, boys and girls?<br> I am not accustomed to speaking in public...<br> - Only public houses.<br> - But this...<br> Never use. It's against the rules.<br> Break a man's nose. Now the...<br> - I'm afraid he will never make a boxer.<br> - No aptitude for knowledge.<br> Mr Gruffydd.<br> Ivor... fell under a tram, lower level.<br> Ivor!<br> - We have our first grandson, Gwil.<br> - Well, give one and take the other.<br> Tell that to that girl up there.<br> She will answer you.<br> - Hist now, Beth. Do not kindle the wrath.<br> - To hell with the wrath.<br> And I'm saying it plain to be heard.<br> 'Tis good. With honours, then.<br> Our son is a scholar.<br> What is it, Huw? I can't make sense with it.<br> - Latin, it is.<br> - Latin, is it?<br> Why not good Welsh, or even English?<br> - It is the fashion.<br> - Fashion.<br> Frenchies, decimal points,<br> and bathtubs full of holes.<br> My poor Huw. They've stuffed<br> your head with Latin, then?<br> - Beth, my old beauty, you. A black eye, is it?<br> - Go ahead, shout. Wake up the baby, then.<br> There is beautiful.<br> The image of my father, he is.<br> What bloody nonsense.<br> Now then, Huw. What will it be?<br> To Cardiff to school, then the university<br> to be a lawyer, is it, or a doctor?<br> Dr Huw Morgan. Well, Uncle Huw,<br> that will be something special.<br> Yes, indeed, with a lovely horse and trap,<br> and a good black suit and a shirt with starch.<br> There is good, my little one.<br> Now, a glass of buttermilk for you,<br> with all your knowledge.<br> Yes, Mother. And some of Bron's shortcake.<br> And my shortcake is<br> to be fed to the pigs, is it?<br> No. Only I finished yours yesterday,<br> and today is shortcake day with Bron.<br> I'm sorry, Huw.<br> Only currant bread I made today.<br> Nobody to eat it now.<br> Mother. I am lonely without him.<br> I put his boots and clothes ready every night,<br> but they are there still in the morning.<br> There is lonely I am.<br> Gwil, I will have Bron<br> here to live if she will come.<br> Not Bron.<br> One mistress in the house.<br> Now, Huw, what will it be?<br> I will go down the colliery with you, sir.<br> Have sense, boy.<br> The colliery is no place for you.<br> Why not try for a respectable job?<br> Respectable? Are you and his brothers<br> a lot of old jailbirds, then?<br> Leave it now, Beth.<br> I only want the best for the boy.<br> If he is as good a man as you<br> and his brothers, I will rest happy.<br> I am thinking of the boy's future.<br> It was different in our day.<br> There was good money and fair play<br> for all. But Huw is a scholar.<br> Why take brains down a coal mine?<br> I would rather, sir.<br> All right.<br> Decide for yourself.<br> But blame yourself if you are wrong.<br> The colliery, sir.<br> - All right, the colliery it is.<br> - Good.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To get drunk.<br> Bron?<br> - I am going down the colliery.<br> - The colliery, is it?<br> The old coal will be shaking in its seam.<br> Bron...<br> Bron.<br> Would you have me to live<br> in this house, and have my wages?<br> - Your home is with your mother.<br> - It was she who sent me.<br> - From pity.<br> - No, from sense.<br> If you put clothes night and morning,<br> let them be my clothes.<br> - Good old man.<br> - Yes or no, Bron?<br> - Yes.<br> - Good.<br> Good. I will get my bed.<br> - So it is a man now, is it?<br> - And could I carry such a man?<br> Lanto! No.<br> Five shillings.<br> Seven and tuppence.<br> - Move along.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Three shillings.<br> Two and nine.<br> One pound two.<br> Two pounds ten.<br> Discharged, Morgan.<br> Move along.<br> Two pound ten.<br> Discharged, Morgan.<br> One pound ten.<br> And so it came to lanto and Davy,<br> the best workers in the colliery,<br> but too highly paid to compete<br> with poorer, more desperate men.<br> - Will you read us a chapter, Father?<br> - Yes, my son.<br> "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."<br> "He maketh me<br> to lie down in green pastures:<br> He leadeth me beside the still waters."<br> "He restoreth my soul:<br> He leadeth me in the paths<br> of righteousness for his name's sake."<br> "Yea, though I walk through<br> the valley of the shadow of death,<br> I will fear no evil: For thou art with me."<br> "Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."<br> "Thou preparest a table before me<br> in the presence of mine enemies:<br> Thou anointest my head with oil."<br> "My cup runneth over."<br> One line to Owen and Gwil,<br> down to Cape Town to Angharad.<br> Over here to Canada to lanto,<br> and down here to Davy in New Zealand.<br> And you are the star,<br> shining on them from this house,<br> all the way across the continents and oceans.<br> All the way?<br> How far am I shining then, if you can<br> put it all on a little piece of paper?<br> Now, a map it is, my old beauty. A picture<br> of the world to show you where they are.<br> I know where they are, without any old maps,<br> or scratches, or spiders, or pencils.<br> They are in the house.<br> Then Angharad came back<br> from Cape Town without her husband.<br> She did not come to us,<br> but stayed at the big Evans house.<br> Her house, on top of the hill.<br> - To see Mrs Evans, please.<br> - Who is it?<br> Huw Morgan.<br> Her brother, is it?<br> Come in.<br> Huw.<br> Mrs Nicholas,<br> will you bring some tea, please?<br> Sit down, Huw.<br> There is grown you are.<br> - And changed.<br> - You too.<br> I look ill and ought to take care of myself.<br> Everyone coming in the house says so,<br> so you say it too, and let us finish with it.<br> But tell me all the news.<br> How is...<br> How are all the boys<br> and girls we used to know?<br> Well...<br> The Jenkins girls are married.<br> Maldwyn Hughes has gone to be a doctor.<br> Rhys Howell is in a solicitor's office,<br> and is sending home ten shillings a week.<br> And Mr Gruffydd...<br> is still first up and last to bed.<br> How is he, Huw?<br> Not as he was.<br> Is he ill?<br> Inside.<br> In his eyes and in his voice.<br> Like you.<br> Please go home, Huw.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Now then, Mrs Evans. Tea, is it?<br> Leave it, Mrs Nicholas. I will pour.<br> Well.<br> I always did the pouring<br> for Mr lestyn's poor mother.<br> - I will pour.<br> - Yes, Mrs Evans.<br> A new mistress is like new sheets.<br> Yes. A little bit stiff,<br> but washing's to come.<br> Why do you have her here?<br> Or so she tells me 60 times a day.<br> - Have some tea, Huw.<br> - You don't want me to go?<br> No. No, Huw.<br> I'm sorry for being nasty.<br> Please stay.<br> Huw. I tried to tell Mother, but...<br> Not for me to say.<br> Only the housekeeper I am.<br> and living to curse the day.<br> It will not surprise me any day to see<br> the old master rise from his grave.<br> 'Tis only the gravestone<br> holding him down, I will swear.<br> Then what is it, Mrs Nicholas?<br> Divorce.<br> Divorce.<br> Saying nothing, I am.<br> But that is what is in her mind.<br> She is here without her husband, is it?<br> And why? It is because<br> she is in love with this preacher.<br> Preacher, I said. Mr Gruffydd, it is.<br> But Mr Gruffydd has not been near the house.<br> What difference is that, girl?<br> Get on with your work.<br> We will not say a word, Mrs Nicholas.<br> No.<br> You're a filthy liar!<br> - Let up!<br> - Let me at him!<br> Liar!<br> As the slag had spread over my valley,<br> so now a blackness spread<br> over the minds of its people.<br> For the first time in my memory,<br> our front door was shut tight in the daytime.<br> Dadda?<br> Well, Huw?<br> Trouble with the Philistines, is it?<br> Huw, what is it now? Look at your hands.<br> Evan John.<br> He... he said things<br> about Angharad and Mr Gruffydd.<br> Children too.<br> You were right, my son.<br> - I will be back for breakfast.<br> - You will not go to chapel?<br> No.<br> And if they do this thing,<br> I will never set foot<br> in the chapel again as long as I live.<br> I will have the sheets warm on your bed.<br> - There is an old beauty you are.<br> - Go and scratch, boy.<br> What is this about the chapel, Mother?<br> Tonight, after the service.<br> A deacons' meeting over Angharad.<br> Angharad? But she has done nothing.<br> Nothing is enough for people<br> who have minds like cesspools.<br> Huw, my little one.<br> I hope when you're grown,<br> their tongues will be slower to hurt.<br> - Will Angharad have to be at the meeting?<br> - No. None of us will be there.<br> But the disgrace will not stay away.<br> I will go, Mother.<br> This is the last time I will talk in this chapel.<br> I am leaving the valley with regret<br> toward those who have helped me here,<br> and who have let me help them.<br> But...<br> for the rest of you,<br> those of you who have only proved<br> that I have wasted my time among you,<br> I have only this to say.<br> There is not one among you<br> who has had the courage<br> to come to me and accuse me of wrongdoing.<br> And yet, by any standard,<br> if there has been a sin,<br> I am the one who<br> should be branded the sinner.<br> Will anyone raise his voice<br> here now to accuse me?<br> No.<br> You're cowards, too, as well as hypocrites.<br> But I don't blame you.<br> The fault is mine as much as yours.<br> The idle tongues,<br> the poverty of mind which you have shown,<br> mean that I have failed to reach most<br> of you with the lesson I was given to teach.<br> Huw?<br> I thought when I was a young man<br> that I would conquer the world, with truth.<br> I thought I would lead an army<br> greater than Alexander ever dreamed of.<br> Not to conquer nations,<br> but to liberate mankind.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - With truth.<br> With the golden sound of the Word.<br> But only a few of them heard.<br> Only a few of you understood.<br> The rest of you<br> put on black and sat in chapel.<br> Why do you come here?<br> Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black<br> and parade before your God on Sunday?<br> From love? No. For you've shown<br> that your hearts are too withered<br> to receive the love of your divine Father.<br> I know why you've come.<br> I've seen it in your faces Sunday after<br> Sunday as I've stood here before you.<br> Fear has brought you here.<br> Horrible, superstitious fear.<br> Fear of divine retribution.<br> A bolt of fire from the skies,<br> the vengeance of the Lord,<br> and the justice of God.<br> But you have forgotten the love of Jesus.<br> You disregard his sacrifice.<br> Death. Fear.<br> Flames, horror, and black clothes.<br> Hold your meeting, then.<br> But know if you do this in the name<br> of God, and in the house of God,<br> you blaspheme against him and his Word.<br> Wait.

Men. Women.<br> Those of you with relatives.<br> Let them to the pit.<br> - Gwilym Morgan?<br> - Not yet, sir.<br> Mr Gruffydd? On the lower level, he was.<br> - My father?<br> - Not yet, Mrs Evans.<br> Angharad...<br> Who is for Gwilym Morgan and the others?<br> I for one.
