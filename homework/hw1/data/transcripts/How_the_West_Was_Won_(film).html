                        This land has a name today<br> and is marked on maps.<br> But the names and the marks and the land<br> all had to be won.<br> Won from nature and from primitive man.<br> Five generations ago,<br> a mere 125 years back...<br> ...this land was known only as the West...<br> ...known only to a handful of white men...<br> ...lonely trappers wandering its vastness<br> in search of beaver.<br> They were known as ''mountain men'',<br> a new breed.<br> Men like Jim Bridger, Linus Rawlings...<br> ...more Indian than the Indians<br> in all but blood.<br> They held to no law but their own...<br> ...drifted free as the clouds,<br> settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.<br> Their mocassined feet and unshod horses<br> left no trace on the land.<br> Like the Indians,<br> with whom they were at peace...<br> ...they wanted nothing<br> beyond what they found and little of that.<br> The mountains, the forests,<br> the harsh country...<br> ...were as unchanging to them<br> as the stars...<br> ...and just as unyielding.<br> Far behind the mountains,<br> beyond the rolling plains...<br> ...they had left the people of the East...<br> ...people who were restless in another way.<br> The kind who would look at the mountain<br> and see a watershed...<br> ...look at the forest<br> and see lumber for houses...<br> ...look at a stony field and see a farm.<br> Their faces and their instincts<br> had been turned to the West...<br> ...ever since Plymouth Rock<br> and James Town.<br> The trapper's road was the trade<br> of the wolf or the bend of the canyon.<br> But for whole families following the sun,<br> there had to be broader ways.<br> There were no roads into the woodlands,<br> only rivers...<br> ...and they flowed in the wrong direction,<br> north or south.<br> Or else they stopped at the Alleghanys.<br> Until one day...<br> ...a new river took source in the mind<br> of a man named DeWitt Clinton.<br> He conceived of a river that would go west.<br> And in the way Americans have<br> of acting out their dreams, it came to be.<br> The Erie Canal left the Hudson<br> above Albany...<br> ...and carried clear across<br> to the Great Lakes.<br> People who yearned for virgin land<br> and the new life...<br> ...now had a highway to take them.<br> And they moved along.<br> Pride of Utica now loading.<br> All aboard for the Pride of Utica.<br> The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...<br> ...the Skoga family...<br> ...all eight of 'em.<br> All aboard for the Pride of Utica.<br> ls the laddie's health<br> the reason you're heading west?<br> Partly.<br> Only partly.<br> Mostly our trouble East was rocks.<br> l had me a farm where some years<br> l'd raise 100 bushels of rocks a year.<br> Zebulon, you hadn't oughta lie<br> to the man like that.<br> Wife, l'm a God-fearing soul,<br> and l tell the truth as l see it.<br> l never used a plow.<br> l'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.<br> Then one mornin'...<br> ...l hauled the bucket up<br> out of the well and...<br> ...so help me, the bucket was full of rocks.<br> Rocks.<br> l just stood there right still<br> trying not to blaspheme...<br> ...and said to myself:<br> ''You've got a son that's ailin'.<br> ''You've got a 20-year-old daughter<br> who won't take a husband.''<br> There she sits, moonin' as usual.<br> Pa.<br> ''You've got another daughter,<br> just don't seem quite right in the head.''<br> Lilith.<br> Yes, Pa?<br> l remind you, sir.<br> l'm still standing there<br> holding a bucket full of rocks...<br> ...and staring into a bleak old age.<br> So l made me a vow<br> right then and there. l said:<br> ''lf l can find a man with $500<br> who likes rocks...<br> ''...then there's gonna be another fool<br> ownin' this farm.''<br> Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...<br> ...and here l am.<br> He ain't told you one word of truth,<br> Mr. Harvey.<br> We had the best farm in the township.<br> Yeah, Rockville Township it was.<br> Stone County.<br> Oh, it was not.<br> lt was his itchin' foot that brought us here.<br> Heaven knows where we'll end up.<br> Oh, these are my laddies.<br> Angus, Brutus and Colin.<br> -How do you do?<br> -Hello.<br> l think they're already acquainted<br> with your daughters.<br> Be they single?<br> Aye, single so far.<br> Well, this lllinois country's beginning<br> to sound better to me.<br> Lilith, strike up a little tune<br> for these handsome lads.<br> l ain't in no mood, Pa.<br> Lilith, there's a time for coaxin'.<br> This ain't the time.<br> All right.<br> ''A captain bold in Halifax<br> ''Who lived in country quarters<br> ''Betrayed a maid who hanged herself<br> -''One morning in her daughter's--''<br> -Lilith!<br> Now, you know better<br> than to sing a song like that.<br> -What ones do you know?<br> -We know ''Yankee Doodle''.<br> -''Yankee Doodle''?<br> -Their mother's dead.<br> They haven't had much learnin'<br> in the social graces since we left Scotland.<br> All right, give 'em<br> ''A Home in the Meadow''.<br> ''Away, away, come away with me<br> Eve, you, too.<br> -''Where the grass grows wild<br> -That's it.<br> -''And the winds blow free<br> -Come on, join in.<br> -''Away, away, come away with me<br> -That's it, that's it.<br> ''And l'll make you a home in the meadow<br> ''Come, come, there's a wondrous land<br> ''For the hopeful heart<br> ''For the willing hand<br> ''Come, come, there's a wondrous land<br> ''Where l'll build you a home<br> ln the meadow''<br> Loading for the Flying Arrow.<br> All aboard for the Flying Arrow.<br> The Prescott family.<br> Here we be. Come on.<br> Alex Harvey and three sons.<br> Jeffrey Rose and family.<br> ''l've got an old mule and her name is Belle<br> ''Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal<br> ''She's a mighty slow worker<br> But a good ole pal<br> ''Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal<br> ''We've pulled some barges in our day<br> ''Filled with people callin' 'hey'<br> ''Fifteen miles<br> ''On the Erie Canal! ''<br> But the canal was only the first step<br> toward the promised land.<br> The next steps were longer and harder.<br> Those who could raise the fare<br> went by steamboat to the end of the line.<br> Others found a cheaper way<br> to head for Ohio, Illinois...<br> ...and the open spaces beyond.<br> Lilith...listen to this:<br> ''Theirs was a poignant parting<br> in the forest.<br> ''The handsome young backwoodsman<br> carved two hearts on a tree trunk...<br> ''...then from ten paces, hurled a knife<br> at the junction of the two hearts.''<br> Junction, what's that?<br> Well, that's where the two hearts meet.<br> Now, listen:<br> ''His marksmanship was uncanny.<br> ''Three times he hurled the knife on target.<br> '''That was for luck', he said the first time.<br> '''That was for love, deep, divine love',<br> he said the second.<br> ''And the third time, 'That was a prayer...<br> '''...a plea for love undying.'''<br> lsn't that beautiful?<br> l reckon. lf anybody ever talks like that.<br> Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.<br> There ain't no sense to you, Eve.<br> You want to be a farm wife<br> but you don't want to marry a farmer.<br> Neither do you.<br> Of course not.<br> l don't want to have nothin'<br> to do with farms.<br> l want silk dresses and fine carriages...<br> ...and a man to smell good.<br> What l want's back East, not West...<br> ...and l'll get there yet. You watch.<br> You don't know what you want yet.<br> lt's the man that counts,<br> not where he lives.<br> -Ready, man?<br> -Ready.<br> Daddy, somethin' comin' up river.<br> Hostile lndians, l expect.<br> -Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?<br> -Don't know.<br> They say no honest man<br> travels this river at night.<br> l can only see one man, Pa.<br> l hear that's a favorite pirate trick.<br> They hide in the bottom of the boat...<br> ...till they're ready to jump you.<br> -Get my gun, Colin.<br> -All right, Pa.<br> Just come in slow and easy, stranger.<br> And keep your hands<br> where we can see 'em.<br> Name's Linus Rawlings.<br> l'm hungrier than sin and real peaceful like.<br> -What've you got in the craft?<br> -Beaver pelts.<br> l said beaver pelts.<br> l never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,<br> Mr. Rawlings.<br> Well, in that case, ma'am,<br> l'll show you one.<br> There you are.<br> Oh, that's real soft.<br> lt's a fine pelt, ma'am.<br> Now, my apologies, sir.<br> We was afraid you might be a pirate.<br> l ain't no pirate.<br> Come on, let's have supper<br> and get acquainted.<br> No, no. That's yours. You keep that.<br> Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.<br> ls he the backwoodsman<br> you've been waiting for?<br> More than likely he's got<br> a wife and six kids waiting for him.<br> ''When l was single<br> ''Went dressed up so fine<br> ''Now l am married<br> ''Go ragged all the time.''<br> Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.<br> You've only ate four plates.<br> l was beginning to think you didn't like it.<br> Well, it don't pay to eat too much<br> on an empty stomach, ma'am.<br> How come you to be travelin'<br> so late at night?<br> Well, l'm kinda anxious<br> to get to Pittsburgh.<br> l ain't seen a city for a long time.<br> l aim to whoop it up a little.<br> We've never seen a mountain man before.<br> Tell me, them Rocky Mountains<br> as high as they say?<br> Well, now, l just don't rightly know.<br> l never climbed one.<br> l've, well...that just ain't exactly true.<br> Jim Bridger and me,<br> we started up one of them little biddy...<br> ...Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.<br> And then, one day, we see this fella...<br> ...and he has a great big pair<br> of white wings...<br> ...and a harp in his hand.<br> And l said to Jim...<br> ...l said, ''Jim, l don't like the way<br> that fella's lookin' at us.''<br> And Jim said he didn't care too much<br> for it either...<br> ...so we both skidaddled down<br> out of there...<br> ...and to this day l ain't never had<br> a good look at the Rocky Mountains.<br> -l remember one time--<br> -Zebulon.<br> What?<br> One liar at a time is enough.<br> Well, then, l reckon it's about bedtime.<br> Gotta get an early start in the mornin'.<br> We'll be expectin' you for breakfast.<br> Well, that's mighty hospitable,<br> Mr. Prescott...<br> ...but sometimes l wake up<br> and get the urge to move.<br> l might be long gone by sunup,<br> but l want to thank you.<br> l want to thank all of you. Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Strange fellas, these mountain men.<br> Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.<br> By golly, that looks like my blanket.<br> lt is.<br> Well, then, l'm a might confused, ma'am.<br> Whose bed would it be?<br> Yours.<br> l ain't never saw a bed like that<br> since last time l come East.<br> Why'd you do it?<br> lt ain't polite to ask a girl<br> why she done something for a man.<br> No. Well, l reckon my manners<br> ain't much at that.<br> Anyway, l sure thank you.<br> Good night, ma'am.<br> Are them lndian girls pretty?<br> Well, now, l reckon that all depends<br> on just how long a man's gone...<br> ...without seein' one.<br> How long's it been<br> since you seen a white girl?<br> l ain't quite sure why you asked that.<br> How pretty do l look to you?<br> Ain't you just bein' a little bit forward?<br> You're headed upriver<br> and l'm headed down.<br> There's no time<br> to get these questions answered.<br> You dead sure you want 'em answered?<br> Yes.<br> Oh, glory be!<br> Ma'am, it seems like<br> you've been kissed before.<br> l've never been kissed permanent before.<br> By golly, you sure use surprising words.<br> l never heard permanent mixed up<br> with a thing like a kiss before.<br> l can still feel that kiss.<br> Can you?<br> You said somethin' before<br> we hadn't oughta forget:<br> l'm headin' upstream<br> and you're headed downstream.<br> Lovers have parted before<br> and come together again.<br> Eve, l, l'm a sinful man.<br> l'm deep, dark, sinful.<br> l'm on my way to Pittsburgh<br> to be sinful again.<br> Likely l'll stay drunk for a month.<br> l won't even remember<br> the fancy gals l dally with...<br> ...or the men l carve up<br> just out of pure cussedness...<br> ...any more than l'll remember you.<br> Linus, l'm askin' you.<br> Can you still feel that kiss?<br> Eve....<br> Eve, you make me feel like a man<br> standing on a narrow ledge...<br> ...comin' face to face with a grizzly bear.<br> There just ain't no ignorin' the situation.<br> Eve!<br> Eve!

Brandy.<br> Chloroform.<br> Get it all down.<br> Come on, all of it!<br> Come on. We're just in the way here.<br> It had been the bloodiest day<br> of the war on the Western front.<br> In the morning, it had looked like<br> a Confederate victory...<br> ...but by nightfall...<br> ...no man cared to use<br> the words ''win'' or ''lose''.<br> After Shiloh...<br> ...the South never smiled.<br> You tasted that water yet?<br> -No.<br> -Well, try it.<br> -Tastes funny, huh?<br> -Yeah.<br> l seen it before sundown. lt was pink.<br> Pinker than sassafras tea.<br> You mean...?<br> lt don't seem fittin' a man should have<br> to drink water like that.<br> Don't seem fittin' a man should have<br> to do any of the things we've done today.<br> Did you kill anybody?<br> l don't think so.<br> l got knocked dizzy right off.<br> Then when l come to and found my rifle,<br> it was busted.<br> Then some more soldiers come along<br> and tried to stick me in the arm.<br> All the rest is, is mixed up after that.<br> l ain't killed nobody, neither.<br> And l don't want to.<br> -Hey, where you from?<br> -Ohio.<br> This fool war started in the East.<br> What's us Westerners doin' in it?<br> l don't rightly know any more!<br> lt ain't quite what l expected.<br> There ain't much glory in lookin' at a man<br> with his guts hangin' out.<br> -Where you from?<br> -Texas.<br> Say....<br> You ain't a Reb, are you?<br> Well, l was this mornin'.<br> Tonight, l ain't so sure.<br> lt seems like, l oughta be shootin' you.<br> Well, you got anything to shoot with?<br> No.<br> All l got's this bayonet.<br> l got a pistol.<br> l took it off a dead officer.<br> Hey, why don't we skedaddle out of here?<br> -You mean desert?<br> -l mean, why don't--<br> Just leave this here war<br> to the folks who want it.<br> They say there ain't no war<br> out in California.<br> Stragglers, join your regiment.<br> Stragglers! Hey, you!<br> l'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade<br> into this area.<br> Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.<br> Do you approve?<br> l'll approve any dispositions<br> you want to make.<br> lf you hadn't held the flank today,<br> we'd have been whipped for fair.<br> Sherman, let's sit down a minute.<br> There's somethin' l wanna say to you.<br> Lantern.<br> You may find yourself in command here.<br> Why?<br> l've seen some of the dispatches<br> the newspaper correspondents...<br> ...have filed today.<br> They're sayin' l was taken by surprise<br> this morning.<br> You weren't taken by surprise.<br> l was.<br> No matter.<br> They're sayin'...<br> ...l was drunk again last night.<br> Were you?<br> No.<br> But you can't fight front and rear.<br> Win or lose, tomorrow...<br> ...l intend to resign.<br> Because of the newspapers?<br> Because of the general<br> lack of confidence in me.<br> Don't you think l've ever felt like that?<br> A month ago they were sayin'<br> l was crazy. lnsane.<br> And now they're callin' me a hero.<br> Hero or crazy, l'm the same man.<br> lt doesn't matter what the people think.<br> lt's what you think, Grant.<br> You mean that's Grant?<br> l reckon.<br> General Grant.<br> You know this war is gonna be won<br> in the West and how to win it.<br> Everything you've done proves it.<br> And l say that a man has the right<br> to resign only if he's wrong.<br> Not if he's right.<br> l guess l never thought of it that way.<br> l'll think it over.<br> What is there to think about?<br> The Army's better off with you<br> than without you. That's the test.<br> All right.<br> Thanks.<br> There's a lot to do<br> before morning, Sherman?<br> What are you doin'?<br> Why'd you make me do that?<br> ''When Johnny comes marching home again<br> Hurrah, hurrah<br> ''We'll give him a hearty welcome and<br> Hurrah, hurrah<br> ''The men will cheer, the boys will shout<br> The ladies they will all turn out<br> ''And we'll all feel gay<br> When Johnny comes marching home<br> ''Get ready to join the jubilee<br> Hurrah, hurrah<br> ''We'll drink up a toast, or two, or three<br> Hurrah, hurrah<br> ''The band will play and we'll sing for joy<br> And all the ladies will kiss the boys<br> ''And we'll all feel gay<br> When Johnny comes marching home<br> ''The men will cheer, the boys will shout''<br> Hey, Zeb.<br> Didn't you get my letter?<br> l wrote more than four months ago.<br> She never was...<br> ...quite the same<br> after she got the news about Pa.<br> l don't think she minded goin', Zeb,<br> except...<br> ...she wanted to see you again.<br> 'Course Pa ain't really there.<br> l put up a stone anyway.<br> l'd better be on my way.<br> Way? Where?<br> l need you, Zeb.<br> Only one thing brought me back...<br> ...and she's....<br> Well, this farm is half yours.<br> l'm thinkin' we'd finally clear away<br> that patch of woods down by the river....<br> You're twice the farmer l am.<br> You don't need me.<br> That farm's all yours. That's only fair.<br> l sure don't feel right about this.<br> What are you gonna do?<br> l haven't mustered out yet.<br> l can still transfer to the regulars.<br> The cavalry, maybe. And go West.<br> And have to fight lndians?<br> You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.<br> Now, what do you wanna do that for?<br> Do you like fightin'?<br> Do you remember the story Pa used<br> to tell us about fightin' that grizzly bear?<br> Yeah.<br> And l asked him. l said:<br> ''Now, why'd you get in such a fix?<br> ''Do you like fightin' grizzlies?''<br> He said:<br> ''Well, not 'specially.<br> ''l just wanted to go somewhere<br> and the bear was there first.''<br> l guess l just wanna go somewhere, too.<br> -So long.<br> -So long, Zeb.<br> Even while North and South were being<br> torn apart...<br> ...East and West had been<br> drawn together by the Pony Express...<br> ...the most daring mail route in history.<br> Eighty riders were in the saddle<br> at all times, night and day, in all weather.<br> Half of them riding east, half riding west...<br> ...between Missouri and Sacramento...<br> ...carrying mail cross-country<br> in days instead of months.<br> Unarmed, they rode to save weight.<br> Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,<br> and on thin paper, too.<br> It was courage, skill and speed...<br> ...against hostile Indians, bandits,<br> hell and occasional high water.<br> Even as they rode,<br> men were already building a faster...<br> ...message carrier across the country,<br> the Overland Telegraph.<br> And the Indians found a new amusement...<br> ...listening to the level tune<br> of the singing wires.<br> But far less amusing to the Indians...<br> ...was the coming of the steel roadway<br> of the Iron Horse.<br> The surveyors' route lay through immense<br> natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...<br> ...and the equally discouraging<br> High Sierras.<br> But range upon range could never stop<br> the titanic contest...<br> ...between two corporate giants<br> racing to put down...<br> ...the greatest mileage of track<br> before they met:<br> The Central Pacific eastward<br> from Sacramento through the Sierras.<br> And the Union Pacific,<br> forging westward across the plains...<br> ...with the Rockies still to come.<br> The prize in the race was free land,<br> vast parcels for every mile of track laid.<br> Land that would one day be worth millions.<br> Hold it!<br> Set it down!<br> Up!<br> Where'd you find 'em?<br> 'Bout a mile back yonder.<br> That's Johnny Hormatz. And Jack Perkins.<br> What the hell is this? A picnic?<br> The lndians got a couple of our men--<br> Mister, you were the foreman here.<br> Now you're a tracklayer.<br> Now get back to work, all of you!<br> Move it!<br> Fast!<br> -You.<br> -Yes, sir?<br> You're the new foreman, till l find<br> somebody better. Now get 'em at it!<br> -Wait a minute.<br> -Move it!<br> ls your name Jethro Stuart?<br> Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired<br> to hunt buffalo to feed these men...<br> ...not to stop their work.<br> Why'd you bring these bodies here?<br> They're railroaders. l thought somebody<br> on the railroad might be interested.<br> l'm the railroad, and l'm not interested.<br> You should've buried 'em,<br> then tracked down the lndians who did it.<br> Mr. King, like you said, l was hired to hunt,<br> not to dig graves or fight lndians.<br> Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.<br> Two dead men shouldn't bother 'em much.<br> l don't want anything in their thick skulls<br> but their work. Do you understand?<br> Now get rid of those bodies<br> and start trackin' those lndians.<br> You keep forgettin', Mr. King,<br> my job's buffalo.<br> lt was buffalo.<br> Go to the paymaster and draw your time.<br> That foreman fella, you didn't fire him.<br> You just took him down a peg<br> 'cause you needed him.<br> Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?<br> -What the devil is that?<br> -Milk.<br> Milk?<br> The Army must've changed<br> since l was in it.<br> -l just rode in. l'm hungry.<br> -You are, huh?<br> But you'd rather watch them than eat.<br> -ls that it?<br> -That's it.<br> l wish you were as eager<br> to protect this railroad.<br> Did you get any word about the two men<br> who where killed today?<br> l tracked the Arapahoes<br> and talked to the chief.<br> They were a mile off the right-of-way<br> where they had no business...<br> ...drunk and chasin' squaws.<br> lt was as much their fault<br> as it was the lndians'.<br> Well, soldier boy, your job is<br> to fight lndians, not to agree with 'em.<br> Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahoes<br> and l had 20 men.<br> Now, to me...<br> ...agreein' seemed wiser than fightin'.<br> To you, huh?<br> You know, l might just send off<br> a wire to the colonel.<br> He may not agree.<br> l already reported it. He does agree.<br> Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.<br> Trouble, sir?<br> l don't know.<br> Hey, Lieutenant.<br> l just got a message<br> the lndians are up to something.<br> Do you know anything about it?<br> The chief says the railroad's<br> busted the agreement.<br> They've changed the route and are comin'<br> through the Arapahoe huntin' grounds.<br> -You sure the chief's right?<br> -Plenty sure.<br> They're getting the warpaint ready.<br> Can you stand there and tell me...<br> ...that one little change is gonna cost<br> the Arapahoes one buffalo.<br> -Or even one jackrabbit?<br> -Mr. King!<br> They can be made to see it differently.<br> Who's hurting 'em?<br> What's a railroad anyway?<br> Two tracks and a whistle.<br> lt's not the tracks they're afraid of.<br> lt's what the tracks bring.<br> The buffalo hunters slaughtering off<br> their herds.<br> And then the settlers coming in.<br> And when will that be?<br> Twenty, 30 years, maybe?<br> By then, we'll all be dead.<br> Right now we're just crossing the land.<br> That's all. Land that's safe<br> to the Arapahoes for our lifetime.<br> Now, you go talk to 'em.<br> Smoke a peacepipe with 'em.<br> Just get 'em to make a new agreement.<br> That's your job, isn't it?<br> Keeping the peace?<br> l'll keep the peace, Mr. King...<br> ...if you keep your promise.<br> Hear your name's Rawlings<br> and you're from Ohio.<br> Your pa's name couldn't be<br> Linus Rawlings, could it?<br> -Could be.<br> -Knew him.<br> Jethro Stuart.<br> -He used to speak of you.<br> -Used to?<br> Pa was killed at Shiloh.<br> Sit down, Mr. Stuart.<br> Well, better than dyin' behind a plow.<br> l tried it. Settled down for a year once.<br> lt took ten years off my life.<br> Your ma....<br> She must've been somethin' real special<br> gettin' old Linus to stay put.<br> She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.<br> Old Linus.<br> Two years runnin' once, your pa and me<br> trapped together. Up along the Wannakee.<br> We got ourselves so many beaver...<br> ...we had to tie 'em tail-to-tail<br> just to drag 'em down the mountain.<br> Over a mile long it was,<br> that line of beaver pelts.<br> Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth<br> and stretch it about six ways.<br> You sound just like him.<br> l'll take it you meant that kindly.<br> Well, l'd think twice<br> before l called you a liar.<br> Tell me somethin', talkin' about liars:<br> Why would a son of old Linus<br> get mixed up with a man like Mike King?<br> l know what you mean.<br> But Mike King isn't the railroad.<br> l don't think he knows that.<br> He's changin' the route back, is he?<br> No.<br> l know.<br> But he'd do anything<br> to gain a day on the Central Pacific.<br> But he's not a fool. He doesn't want a war.<br> And neither do the Arapahoes.<br> l think l could get them to agree<br> to this change in route if...<br> ...l could just sit down and talk with them<br> for a while.<br> -How're you gonna get 'em to do it?<br> -That's just it.<br> l need somebody that knows the language<br> and that they trust.<br> You wouldn't happen to know someone<br> like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?<br> Your pa could set a trap<br> like no man l ever come across.<br> Just coax 'em on, and wham!<br> You'd better do somethin',<br> so he'll know you're pledgin' your word.<br> That blame whistle's like the crack of doom<br> from all that's natural.<br> My ma felt a man oughta<br> make his scratch on the land...<br> ...and leave it a little different<br> than when he come.<br> Anyway, thanks for fixin' things<br> with the chief.<br> Me? l fixed nothin'.<br> You put the words in my mouth<br> but that won't make 'em come true.<br> l said what l had to, to keep the peace.<br> l know there's a risk.<br> Risks? Maybe you don't understand.<br> You pledged your word back there.<br> Not mine, not the Army's...<br> ...not the railroad's.<br> lt was your word that told 'em<br> they'd keep their huntin' grounds.<br> l think they will.<br> l think you've got your neck stuck out<br> like a prairie chicken...<br> ...waitin' for one side or the other<br> to chop it off.<br> Your pa and me got kicked out<br> of one territory after another...<br> ...with people pourin' in, killin' off game,<br> puttin' up towns....<br> lt ain't gonna stop.<br> Your treaty's gonna get broken and<br> l don't wanna be around to see it happen.<br> Look me up when you get your bellyful.<br> -Where you goin'?<br> -Back to the mountains.<br> To the high lonesome<br> where there ain't no people at all yet.<br> So long.<br> By now the Central Pacific had broken<br> through the wall of the High Sierras...<br> ...and was straining eastward<br> across the flatlands of Nevada.<br> While the Union Pacific,<br> thanks to its long peace with the Indians...<br> ...was able to keep up pressure<br> just as avidly in the opposite direction.<br> The competition was exciting,<br> but also costly...<br> ...and both companies were itching<br> to earn money from tracks already laid.<br> -Did the horses ride all right, Jake?<br> -No better than l did.<br> We'll have to rest 'em a day before we can<br> start huntin' rabbits, much less buffalo.<br> Let's get 'em to water right away.<br> You say no buffalo hunter come.<br> White man, liar.<br> We scout for you no more!<br> Not in our lifetime, you said.<br> And there they are.<br> The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.<br> All right, it's sooner than l figured.<br> But the railroad's broke.<br> They need money to keep movin' on.<br> No people, no money.<br> No money, no railroad.<br> -lt's as simple as that, Lieutenant.<br> -What about the Arapahoes?<br> Take a look at those people.<br> Half of 'em straight from Europe.<br> They'll have a rough time<br> but they'll make it.<br> And do you wanna know<br> why they'll make it?<br> Because they're willing<br> to change their ways.<br> The Arapahoes will have to change, too.<br> lf they don't, they're finished.<br> l know they have to change<br> and some day the land'll be taken over...<br> ...by these farmers<br> with their towns and their cattle.<br> But, not like this.<br> They don't have to be double-crossed,<br> and l don't have to be a part of it!<br> You don't, Lieutenant?<br> Aren't you forgetting that uniform?<br> That's right, Mr. King, l'm forgetting it!<br> lf the Army hasn't got any authority<br> out here, l'm resigning. And, now!<br> l don't see how that's gonna help<br> the Arapahoes.<br> Nothing'll help 'em.<br> But nothing's gonna stop 'em.<br> lndian attack!<br> Take a good look!<br> You wanted a war, and you got one.<br> l hope you're the first man killed in it.<br> Turn those wagons over!<br> Shoot for the lead horses.<br> Sergeant, take over.<br> Rawlings, try that.<br> The lndians are stampeding the buffalo.<br> Dirty skunks! Come on!<br> l told you there'd be no war.<br> Look at 'em.<br> They've quit.<br> They'll be back.<br> They just sent a bunch of animals<br> to kill an animal they call the ''lron Horse''.<br> Well, it's still standin', isn't it?<br> And nothin's gonna stop it.<br> You think you can live with that?<br> l can live with it, or l can die with it.<br> Just listen!<br> You can live with that?<br> That?<br> That ain't cryin'.<br> That's just new life goin' on.<br> Pick up this woman<br> and put the rest of the engine in the shed.<br> The rest of you, back to work.<br> We've got a railroad to build.<br> lt looks like you finally got your bellyful.<br> Hello, Jethro.<br> Appears you're doin' well.<br> Can't complain.<br> Creek's loaded with beavers,<br> fightin' their way into the trap.<br> Ain't no white men lookin'<br> over my shoulder...<br> ...and the lndians are plumb cordial.<br> Toss your stuff in there.<br> Plenty of room for two.<br> Thanks.<br> You'll be bunkin' yonder.<br> Better take your bearin's now,<br> so you can find it when you need it.<br> lf you don't like my snorin'<br> you can build your own cabin tomorrow.<br> l'll furnish the axe.<br> Thanks. l'm just passin' through.<br> Through to where?<br> Anywhere you go is like<br> where you've been.<br> Ain't you lost enough tail feathers<br> back there?<br> l've been plucked some.<br> But that's what l like about this country.<br> There's always greener grass<br> over the next hill.<br> Not no more.<br> Not since that damn railroad come.<br> All the grass is bein' staked out now,<br> with a lock on it.<br> Maybe l'll just have to climb<br> a little higher hill to find it.<br> How about comin' along?<br> Are you crazy?<br> Like the lndians say, ''These rocks<br> and trees around here feel no call to move.<br> ''Why should l?''<br> Guess l'm not an lndian, Jethro.<br> And l'm sure not a rock nor a tree.<br> A man belongs with his own kind,<br> like him or not.<br> The coming of railroads brought changes<br> in the land through which they passed.<br> Now, immense herds of cattle were driven<br> hundreds of miles to meet the lines...<br> ...bound for markets in the East.<br> Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...<br> ...and a long and bloody wrangle began<br> between cattlemen and homesteaders.<br> The law was in the hands of whoever<br> could shoot fast and straight...<br> ...except where there was somebody<br> determined to stand for law.<br> Others might look on sheep and a shepherd<br> as a pastoral scene.<br> But not the cattleman.<br> To him, sheep destroyed grass,<br> and grass came dear.<br> And if a man's life were held cheaper<br> than grass...<br> ...it was considered a casualty of war,<br> not a crime.<br> And, in all this...<br> ...the man with the star was<br> only one against many.<br> But time was running out<br> for the reckless ones...<br> ...the desperadoes,<br> the gallop-and-gunshot boys...<br> ...as more and more citizens demanded<br> respect for the law...<br> ...and showed themselves ready to fight<br> to uphold it.<br> And the raw new towns that sprung up<br> in the West began to dream...<br> ...of becoming as refined as that one-time<br> hooligan city by the Golden Gate.<br> San Francisco was now respectable.<br> So sophisticated, in fact,<br> it even had mansions up for auction.<br> $2,000.<br> $2,000.<br> ls that your

Lilith.<br> Sad?<br> We made and spent<br> three fortunes together.<br> What's so sad about that?<br> lf he'd lived a little longer<br> we would've made and spent another.<br> -l beg your pardon, Mrs. van Valen.<br> -What?<br> The chair, it's been sold. l'm sorry.<br> Well then, take it.<br> Quit apologizin' and take it.<br> Thank you, madam.<br> lf there had been some other way<br> to pay off the debts....<br> lt doesn't matter.<br> l've got two things<br> no one can ever take from me:<br> This, and my land in Arizona.<br> Lilith, l don't want to dash any hopes...<br> ...but that ranch is nearly worthless.<br> Well, it's there, isn't it?<br> Yes, but most of the cattle<br> have been sold off or stolen.<br> l'll get cattle.<br> You'll need someone to work it<br> and manage it for you.<br> -l'll get that, too.<br> -Who?<br> My nephew.<br> He's a marshal out there somewhere.<br> Lilith, at your age it might be<br> kind of rough.<br> Rough?<br> My ma and pa were killed<br> goin'
