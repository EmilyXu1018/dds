Mr. Wilcox,<br> for that last remark, I'd box your ears.<br> You're not fit to sit<br> in the same room as my niece...<br> - All I know is she spread the news <br> - Or to clean her boots.<br> - Might I finish my sentence, please?<br> - No!<br> I decline to argue with such a person.<br> - Let me out ofthis car this instant!<br> - Don't try and stand up!<br> - Stop!

Annie.<br> Let's see, is yours<br> a hooky or a knobbly?<br> Mine's a knobbly. at least I think it is.<br> That's Tibby's.

You'd laugh.<br> You listening. Len?<br> Not only accidents.<br> That you'll get wet in the rain.<br> - Didyou?<br> - No.<br> You said you lost your umbrella.<br> I'll think, "Lord, he'll catch cold."<br> "It'll go to his chest."<br> "And where's the money<br> to come from for the doctor?"<br> "And what if he is<br> in an accident..."<br> "and they take him to the hospital<br> in the ambulance?"<br> "And him with holes in his socks."<br> - Hey, Jacky.<br> - I want to see.<br> - What?<br> - If there's holes in you r socks.<br> Stop it, Jacky.<br> Len.<br> - Come to bed.<br> - I'll just finish this chapter.<br> Len.<br> - You love you rJacky, do you.

Miss Schlegel.<br> - Helen's gone to Germany.<br> - And Paul's gone to Nigeria.<br> [ Chuckling ]<br> So...<br> you see, now we can meet.<br> because they can't.<br> It's no use beating about the bush.<br> What happened in the summer...<br> was unfortunate<br> for both of them, don't you feel?<br> Because <br> I'm sure you think the same way.<br> - Because they should not meet.<br> - Yes.

I'm afraid<br> I shall tire you out in no time.<br> It is true I am not<br> particularly well just today.<br> But I'm so grateful for your visit.<br> Miss Schlegel. You see. I'm quite alone.<br> My husband and daughter have gone off<br> on a motoring tour in Yorkshire...<br> and the young couple<br> are on their honeymoon.<br> - Charles and Dolly.<br> - Oh. may I see? How lovely.<br> They've gone to Naples. I can hardly<br> imagine my Charles in Naples.<br> - Doesn't he like traveling?<br> - Oh. yes. He likes travel.<br> But he does see through<br> foreigners so.<br> What he would enjoy most<br> is a motor tour through England.<br> Charles takes after me,<br> Miss Schlegel.<br> He truly loves England.<br> Not. of course, London.<br> None of us love London.<br> It's so <br> It makes one feel so unstable.<br> impermanent...<br> with houses being torn down<br> on all sides.<br> Including,<br> in the foreseeable future, ours.<br> - Are you having to leave Wickham Place?<br> - Yes.<br> In 1 8 months or so<br> when the lease expires.<br> - Have you been there long?<br> - All our lives. We were born there.<br> Oh, the <br> That is monstrous.<br> Oh, I do pity you,<br> from the bottom of my heart.<br> I had no idea this thing<br> was hanging over you.<br> - How dreadful.<br> - Oh, well <br> - Oh. you poor, poor girls.<br> - Well, of course...<br> we are fond of the house.<br> but it is an ordinary London house.<br> - We shall easily find another.<br> - No.<br> Not in this world.<br> Not the house<br> that you were born in.<br> You'll never find that again.<br> Poor, poor girls.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Howards End was almost<br> pulled down once.<br> It would have killed me.<br> It's my house. you know.<br> It was left to me by my brother<br> who died out in India.<br> I love it so.<br> I even resisted when Henry <br> my husband <br> wanted to make changes<br> to improve the property.<br> He knew best. of course.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> We even have a garage.<br> To the west of the house...<br> just beyond the chestnut tree...<br> in the paddock where<br> the pony used to be.<br> Where's the pony gone?<br> The pony?<br> Oh, dead, ever so long ago.<br> The vice of the pan-German mind is that<br> it only cares for what it can use.<br> -That is the vice of the imperial mind.<br> -No, that is the vice of the vulgar mind.<br> But, and this is the tremendous part.<br> they take poetry seriously.<br> - They do take poetry seriously.<br> - But is anything gained by that?<br> Yes, the Germans<br> are always striving for beauty.<br> Oh, but. Mrs. Wilcox, my father<br> was a German of the old school...<br> a philosopher. an idealist...<br> the countryman of Hegel and Kant.<br> - But isn't that your father's sword<br> you have upstairs in the drawing room?<br> - Oh, yes.<br> He was a soldier too when he had to be.<br> But he was so uncomfortable<br> about being on the winning side...<br> that he just hung up his sword<br> and never used it again.<br> - My idea has always been that...<br> - [ Chatter Dies Down ]<br> if we could bring the mothers...<br> of the various nations together...<br> then there would be no more war.<br> - Oh. indeed. yes.<br> - Absolutely.<br> If the mothers went to war.<br> there'd be no one left to defend.<br> -Mrs. Wilcox. will you have anotherjelly?<br> -Thank you.<br> You are fortunate in your cook.<br> We have found it difficult to get<br> reliable servants in London.<br> -It is difficult.<br> -Servants have become as unreliable as we.<br> We can hardly expect them to listen to<br> radical discussions at the luncheon table.<br> Annie does very well.<br> Don't you. Annie?<br> You're very patient with us.<br> We never discuss at Howards End...<br> except perhaps sport.<br> Oh, but you should.<br> Discussion keeps a house alive.<br> You will laugh<br> at my old-fashioned ideas.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> I will not.<br> I sometimes think...<br> it would be wiser to leave<br> action and discussion to men.<br> But. then where would<br> we be with the suffrage?<br> I am only too thankful<br> not to have the vote myself.<br> Shall we go up for coffee?<br> Duncan. will you lead the way?<br> Thank you.<br> [ Chattering, Indistinct ]<br> - What interesting lives you all lead.<br> - No. we don't.<br> It's no use pretending<br> you enjoyed lunch, for you loathed it.<br> But I hope you will forgive me...<br> by coming again. alone.<br> or by asking me to you.<br> I enjoyed my lunch very much.<br> Miss Schlegel, truly I did.<br> I only wish I could've joined in more.<br> You're <br> You're so clever,<br> and yet, so good.<br> No, that's very kind ofyou,<br> but I am neither, I'm afraid.<br> You've been very good to me.<br> You've kept me from brooding.<br> - I'm too apt to brood.<br> - About what?<br> Well, I don't know.<br> I really don't know.<br> I think about my house a great deal.<br> You've never seen Howards End.<br> I want to show it to you.<br> [ Margaret ] Now. this is the scientific<br> approach to Christmas shopping: a list.<br> [ Mrs. Wilcox ]<br> A list. What a good idea.<br> Why don't you put your own name<br> at the top of the list?<br> Hurray. How very kind ofyou<br> to start with me.<br> "Schlegel." Now, next.<br> Shall I put Mr. Wilcox?<br> - Quite out of the ordinary, you know?<br> - I know. it's these.<br> Now. what do you think of that?<br> And a pretty box.<br> Oh. yes.<br> Oh, thank you very much.<br> - Good. I'm glad.<br> - You are wonderfully efficient.<br> - Thank you. Could we<br> wrap that with a nice bow, please?<br> - Certainly, madam.<br> - But your name still remains<br> at the top of the list.<br> - [ Chuckles ] Yes.<br> So, Dolly. There she goes.<br> I would like to give you<br> something worth your friendship.<br> Couldn't you get it renewed?<br> - I beg your pardon?<br> - The lease ofyour house?<br> Oh, have you been thinking of that?<br> How very kind ofyou.<br> - Surely something could be done.<br> - No. Values have risen too enormously.<br> They mean to pull down Wickham Place<br> and build flats like yours.<br> - But how horrible.<br> - Landlords are horrible.<br> And so are the flats they build.<br> I fail to understand how people<br> can actually choose to live in them.<br> There we are.<br> Oh, dear. There, there we are.<br> Thank you.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> [ Groans ]<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> We shouldn't have done this today.<br> No. no, we had to do it before.<br> - Before?<br> - Before my operation.<br> I still haven't told my family yet,<br> Miss Schlegel. Everyone hates illnesses.<br> Ah, it's as it should be.<br> There's a chestnut tree<br> at Howards End...<br> that has pigs' teeth<br> stuck into the trunk...<br> about four feet from the ground.<br> Yes. the teeth of a pig.<br> The country people<br> put them there long ago...<br> and they think that if they chew<br> a piece of the bark...<br> it will cure the toothache.<br> I love folklore<br> and the old superstitions.<br> Isn't it is curious though.<br> that unlike Greece...<br> England has no true mythology.<br> All we have are<br> witches and fairies.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Will you come with me to Howards End?<br> - Oh. I would so much like to.<br> - Come with me now, now.<br> - Now? But it is too late.<br> - There is a train from St. Pancras<br> at 5:00 if we hurry.<br> - I want you to see it.<br> - And I want to see it.<br> It sounds such a glorious place.<br> so redolent and <br> Yes, yes. I lived there long,<br> long before I was married.<br> I was born there.<br> Well, might I come some other day?<br> Yes.<br> Some other day.<br> Well. a thousands thanks.<br> Miss Schlegel. for your help.<br> It is a comfort to have<br> the presents off my mind...<br> the Christmas cards especially.<br> - I do admire your choice.<br> - [ Clock Chimes ]<br> [ Train Whistle ]<br> Whoa.<br> Mrs. Wilcox.<br> - Miss Schlegel.<br> - I will come if I still may.<br> Return to Hilton. please.<br> - We'll stop the night, my dear.<br> - Yes.<br> It's in the morning my house<br> looks most beautiful.<br> Two returns, please.<br> Thank you.<br> - This is yours?<br> - I can't show you my meadow<br> properly except in the sunrise.<br> - It was so romantic. It was in Italy.<br> - In Italy?<br> Yes. and the two trains<br> stopped on either side. you see...<br> and I opened the window...<br> and this man just<br> handed a rose across.<br> I don't know where he got it.<br> - Was he Italian?<br> - Yes, I think so. Italian.<br> Ah. he'd have to be<br> Italian, wouldn't he?<br> - Mother!<br> - Evie. My dearest girl.<br> -The motor's smashed.<br> -Ruth, what on earth are you doing here?<br> - We crashed the car.<br> - What?<br> - Are you going to Howards End? Why?<br> - Yes.<br> - How are you?<br> - It's such a lovely surprise.<br> I'm fit as a fiddle.<br> You remember Miss Schlegel?<br> Miss Schlegel?<br> Oh, yes. Helen's sister. Hello.<br> - Evie crashed the car in Yorkshire.<br> - How do you do?<br> We must go home. We can't go<br> to Howards End. It's ten to 5:00.<br> Miss Schlegel, I'm afraid our little outing<br> is going to have to be another day.<br> - Before I forget.<br> - Thank you.<br> - There's a German expression for that.<br> - Aufgeschoben ist nicht aufgehoben.<br> - Yes. Not canceled, but postponed.<br> - Postponed.<br> - Come home with us.<br> - No, no.<br> - You sure?<br> - Please. Good-bye.<br> - Till later.<br> - [ Henry ] How lovely to see you.<br> I've been thinking ofyou.<br> And ofour meadow.<br> Here.<br> The day you are strong enough...<br> I shall hold you<br> to your promise.<br> Oh, Miss Schlegel.<br> So, to repeat, we have here...<br> forwarded by the matron<br> of that nursing home...<br> sealed and addressed to me...<br> a note purporting to be<br> in your mother's handwriting.<br> And it says...<br> "I would like Miss Schlegel.<br> Margaret..."<br> "to have Howards End."<br> Mother never wrote that.<br> No date.<br> - No signature.<br> - Of course.<br> It's a forgery.<br> Not now. please. Later.<br> Thank you.<br> The house was of course your mother's<br> to leave to whom she wished.<br> Let me see it.<br> Why, it's only in pencil.<br> Pencil never counts.<br> Yes. we know that it is not<br> legally binding, Dolly.<br> We are aware of that.<br> Ofcourse, my dear,<br> we consideryou as one ofthe family.<br> But it will be better ifyou don't<br> interfere with what you don't understand.<br> The question is whether...<br> during the time that this Miss Schlegel<br> managed to befriend my mother <br> I don't think it's a case<br> of undue influence.<br> To my mind the question is...<br> the invalid's condition<br> when the note was written.<br> My dear father,<br> consult an expert ifyou wish...<br> but I don't admit that it is<br> my mother's handwriting.<br> You just said it was.<br> Never mind if I did.<br> So we are all agreed then that<br> legally I would be quite justified...<br> in tearing this up and<br> throwing it into the fire.<br> All else aside, how is this gift<br> to be conveyed to Miss Schlegel?<br> Is she to have a life interest in it<br> or is she to own it absolutely?<br> She may be on her way down<br> this very minute to turn us all out.<br> I don't believe Miss Schlegel<br> knows anything about this. uh...<br> this whim ofyour mother's.<br> Mother believed so in ancestors.<br> She would never have left<br> anything to an outsider.<br> If Miss Schlegel had been poor.<br> if she had wanted a house <br> But she has a house.<br> Why should she want another?<br> She wouldn't have wanted us<br> to even see this thing.<br> No.<br> Your poor mother<br> would not have wanted it.<br> - Len, you coming in?<br> - In a minute.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> What are you looking at?<br> See that big one up there?<br> It's Ursa Major. the great bear.<br> You follow those two down<br> about four times...<br> and that one there<br> is the polestar.<br> - I'm fairly certain that's it.<br> And they all go round that one.<br> - They're just stars.<br> Jacky. stop it.<br> It's important.<br> You'll catch your death.<br> [ Chattering, Indistinct ]<br> Yes. sir.<br> When can I expect<br> to receive that?<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Mr. Purefour's policy.<br> Yes. yes, yes. yes.<br> That's all signed.<br> It seems fine with me. Thank you.<br> So may I expect<br> to receive that?<br> Oh, yes.<br> All right, Mr. Jackson.<br> You're all done.<br> Could you. uh,<br> complete that?<br> Yes. of course. sir.<br> [ Leonard ] "The trees<br> reared in mighty columns..."<br> "their tops still radiant<br> in sunlight which..."<br> "spilling downward<br> through the wealth of leaves..."<br> "dissolved at last..."<br> "in the darkness<br> ofthe mossy earth."<br> "Their color slowly faded<br> from out ofthe flowers..."<br> "but their scent lingered<br> to honey the air he breathed."<br> There's a woman<br> to see you. ma'am.<br> A woman and not a lady, Annie?<br> - She won't give her name.<br> - Well. ask her to come up.<br> She says she won't come up.<br> Well, then we shall<br> have to go down.<br> - Good afternoon.<br> - I'm looking for my husband.<br> Here? Thankyou, Annie.<br> I have my reasons to believe<br> that he is here.<br> [ Exhales ] Well, you're<br> welcome to search for him.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Your husband's name?<br> Leonard Bast.<br> as I'm sure you're aware of.<br> Margaret. are we concealing<br> a Mr. Leonard Bast?<br> There appears to have been<br> some mistake. Mrs. Bast.<br> I do not think we are acquainted<br> with your husband.<br> Oh, no. There's no mistake.<br> I know for a fact<br> that he has visited in this house.<br> - He had his tea here.<br> - That is a grave allegation.<br> Yes. to have corrupted<br> a married man with giving him tea.<br> I wish we could help you. Mrs. Bast.<br> It seems you can't...<br> or won't...<br> except to have a laugh at my expense.<br> So I'm very sorry<br> to have troubled you...<br> and wish you<br> a very good afternoon.<br> You do what you can for the house.<br> The drawing room reeks of smoke.<br> Ifyou start smoking too,<br> the house might be even more musty.<br> I doubt it.<br> This is lovely. Annie.<br> There's a M r. Leonard Bast.<br> - Oh, no! I don't believe it.<br> - [ Laughing ] The missing husband.<br> - He must be brought in immediately.<br> - The one you corrupted with tea?<br> - I'll do the host.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mr. Bast, come this way.<br> Do come in, M r. Bast.<br> Good evening.<br> Good evening. Do come in<br> and have some pudding with us.<br> - Yes. Or would you prefer some dinner?<br> - I've had my tea. Thank you.<br> - Have a chair. A glass of wine?<br> - No.<br> - Port?<br> - No, thank you.<br> Well. do take a seat<br> in any case. M r. Bast...<br> and let us know<br> how we can help you.<br> You wouldn't remember<br> giving me this?<br> -Not as such.<br> -Well. that was how it happened. you see.<br> - Uh. what?<br> - Where did we meet, Mr. Bast?<br> For the moment.<br> I don't remember.<br> It was more than a year ago.<br> at the Ethical Society.<br> The lecture was<br> on "Music and Meaning."<br> Oh, I see. So the mistake arose<br> out of my card. did it?<br> The lady who called here yesterday<br> thought you were calling as well<br> and that she would find you here.<br> In the afternoon. I said to my wife <br> I said to Mrs. Bast <br> "I have to pay a call on some friends."<br> And Mrs. Bast said to me. "Do go."<br> But while I was gone, she wanted me<br> on important business...<br> and thought I had come here.<br> owing to the card.<br> And I beg to tender<br> my apologies. and hers too...<br> for any inconvenience<br> we may have caused you.<br> - None at all, truly.<br> - I still don't understand.<br> When did you say you paid this call.<br> this afternoon call?<br> In the afternoon, of course.<br> Saturday afternoon or Sunday?<br> - Saturday.<br> - Really?<br> And you were still calling on Sunday<br> when your wife came here? A long visit.<br> [ Margaret ] It was very good ofyou<br> to come explain, Mr. Bast.<br> The rest is naturally<br> no concern of ours.<br> We are going to go upstairs for coffee.<br> I do hope that you will join us.<br> - Annie. pour the coffee. please.<br> - It's not what you think.<br> I was <br> I left my office and walked...<br> right out of London.<br> I was walking<br> all Saturday night.<br> All night? In the dark?<br> It got so dark<br> I couldn't see my own hand.<br> M r. Bast,<br> you must be a born explorer.<br> I tried to steer by the polestar.<br> but once out of doors...<br> everything gets so mixed<br> and I lost it.<br> Don't tell me about the polestar.<br> I know its little ways.<br> It goes round and round,<br> and you go round with it.<br> [ Helen ] Yes, but why?<br> Why didyou do it?<br> I wanted to...<br> just walk...<br> just get out.<br> I've been reading<br> The Ordeal of Richard Feverel.<br> Yes, I remember. There's that chapter<br> where Richard walks all night.<br> - In a forest by moonlight.<br> - Yes. Margaret. what's that wonderful <br> Oh, I know exactly what you mean.<br> [ Both ]<br> "The forest drooped glimmeringly."<br> Wait, I'll get it.<br> The chapter's called "Nature Speaks."<br> - Where do your people come from?<br> - London.<br> Yes. I know, but I mean before that.<br> They didn't always<br> live in a town.<br> No. they came<br> from around Shropshire.<br> They worked on the land.<br> They were agricultural laborers.<br> There. you see?<br> It was ancestral voices calling you.<br> Yes. here it is.<br> "Richard was walking hurriedly."<br> "A pale gray light on the skirts of<br> the flying tempest displayed the dawn."<br> - Did you see the dawn?<br> - Yes, suddenly it got light.<br> - And was it wonderful?<br> - No.<br> - [ Laughing ]<br> - It was only gray.<br> And anyway, by that time<br> I was so tired and so hungry.<br> I didn't know when you're walking...<br> you want a breakfast and lunch and tea<br> during the night as well...<br> -and all I had was a packet of Woodbines.<br> -[All Chuckling ]<br> [ Woman ]<br> No. Money. Give Mr. Bast money.<br> - We really must go. Meg. come on.<br> - Don't bother about his ideals.<br> Your Leonard Bast wouldn't know<br> what to do ifyou just gave him money.<br> Nonsense. Money is very educational.<br> Much more so than the things it buys.<br> Such crass materialism<br> out ofyour mouth, Margaret.<br> Give them money.<br> Let us give Mr. Bast money.<br> [ All Chattering, Indistinct ]<br> What if he gained the whole world.<br> but lost his own soul?<br> But he won't gain his soul until<br> he has enough money to do it with.<br> Give Mr. Bast money.<br> [ All Chattering, Indistinct ]<br> Good night.<br> Yes. well. you worry about the first.<br> Good-bye. Good-bye.<br> Thank you.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> [ Tango ]<br> So what do you think is the most<br> important thing in the world, then?<br> Well, I suppose...<br> - it is whatever matters to you most.<br> - What, like love, for instance?<br> - Yes, like love for instance<br> or Oxford ifyou're Tibby.<br> - Miss Schlegel?<br> - Henry Wilcox.<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - Hello. Good evening.<br> - How nice to see you.<br> What a wonderful surprise.<br> I heard two ladies talking of love.<br> - [ Chuckling ] Oh, no.<br> - No. We were continuing<br> a serious discussion.<br> - Yes?<br> - Yes. We belong to a sort of club...<br> which meets once a week<br> to discuss various subjects.<br> How are you? I would've thought<br> you would be down at Howards End.<br> Howards End is let.<br> We've bought a house in Mayfair.<br> Yes. Mr. Wilcox, supposing<br> you were a millionaire.<br> Oh, but I expect you are one.<br> [ Chuckles ]<br> We have met a young man who is very poor<br> and we think sensitive and intelligent...<br> and we wondered if one was a millionaire<br> how one could help him.<br> -What's his profession?<br> -He's a clerk in What was it. Margaret?<br> - The Porphyrion Fire I nsurance Company.<br> - I nsurance.<br> - Porphyrion?<br> - Yes.<br> Ah, then Miss Schlegel...<br> if I were to help<br> your young clerk...<br> I'd advise him to clear out of<br> the Porphyrion with all possible speed.<br> - Why?<br> - Now, this is between friends...<br> but the Porphyrion is<br> insufficiently reinsured.<br> It'll be in the receivers' hands<br> before Christmas.<br> In other words. it will smash.<br> Do you hear? Helen.<br> the Porphyrion will smash.<br> We'll have to warn Mr. Bast.<br> He'll have to get another place.<br> - I hope he'll get one very quickly.<br> - But rather than wait to make sure?<br> Yes. decidedly. You understand.<br> the man who is already in a situation...<br> when he applies for work...<br> stands a much better chance. naturally.<br> This is letting you<br> into state secrets, of course...<br> but, uh. it does affect<br> an employer greatly.<br> Human nature, I'm afraid.<br> Well. our human nature appears<br> to be quite the other way around.<br> We employ people<br> because they're unemployed <br> - The bootman, for instance.<br> - How does he clean the boots?<br> - Not well.<br> - There you are.<br> Mr. Wilcox, is it very difficult nowadays<br> for a clerk to get a situation?<br> - Yes. extremely.<br> - I'm so sorry about Howards End.<br> - Hmm?<br> - I mean that you're not living there.<br> I think I have some idea of how much<br> her house meant to Mrs. Wilcox.<br> Yes. but to us. the family.<br> it has certain drawbacks.<br> Would you be able to help?<br> Our friend. help him to a new situation?<br> Well, unfortunately. we have very few<br> positions and vacancies.<br> And when there is one. of course...<br> - always hundreds of applicants.<br> - Of course.<br> - It has been a pleasure. Miss Schlegel.<br> - Yes, indeed.<br> Miss Schlegel. I hope<br> your young clerk finds success.<br> - Thank you. Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Well, he was in a hurry<br> to get away. wasn't he?<br> - Ah. Wilcox.<br> - What was all that about?<br> Mr. Bast...<br> I fear you may have thought<br> our letter a little odd.<br> We're not odd. really.<br> We're just over-expressive. That's all.<br> The more a lady has to say, the better.<br> Ladies brighten every conversation.<br> Yes. I know. The darlings are regular<br> sunbeams. Let me give you a plate.<br> Your company is the Porphyrion. isn't it?<br> Would you call it a solid concern?<br> Cake? This big one<br> or one of these little deadlies?<br> It depends what you mean by solid.<br> We were told the Porphyrion's a no-go.<br> A friend of ours did think...<br> - that it's insufficiently reinsured.<br> - And advised you to clear out.<br> - You can tell your friend that he's wrong.<br> - Oh. good! [ Chuckling ]<br> Wrong. so to speak.<br> How, so to speak?<br> I mean, I wouldn't say<br> he was right altogether.<br> Then he is right partly?<br> Tell your friend to mind<br> his own business.<br> - [ Knocking, Door Opens ]<br> - Annie.<br> Mr. Wilcox, Miss Wilcox.<br> Oh.<br> - What a surprise!<br> - [ Helen Laughing ]<br> Oh, they're beautiful.<br> - Mr. Wilcox. do come in.<br> - Miss Schlegel, pray forgive us<br> for calling so unexpectedly.<br> - Mr. Bast. come play with puppies.<br> - M r. Wilcox. this is Mr. Bast.<br> - Aren't they beautiful?<br> - I must be going.<br> Oh, must you really?<br> Oh, come again.<br> No. I shan't. I shan't come again.<br> I call that a very rude remark. What do<br> you want to turn on me like that for?<br> I thought you invited me here as <br> for a friendly chat.<br> Instead it turns out you want to pick<br> my brains about my place of business.<br> Oh. yes. "Send for him.<br> Cross-question him. Pick his brains."<br> - No. no!<br> - Are we intruding, Miss Schlegel?<br> Shall we go?<br> No. no. Thank you.<br> Helen, go after him. Explain.<br> - What was all that about?<br> - I knew I shouldn't have come.<br> It was all right last time,<br> but things like that always get spoiled.<br> Things do. but people don't.<br> Don't you understand?<br> We really did want to warn you<br> about the Porphyrion.<br> We were worried about you.<br> - Why should you worry about me?<br> - Because we like you.<br> That's why...<br> you noodle.<br> -There's no cause to call a person names.<br> - Yes. there is when a person is being<br> tremendously stupid.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> Oh, listen. This is serious.<br> Our friend said you should be<br> looking around for another post now...<br> before anything happens.<br> - Will you?<br> - I'll think about it.<br> No. you must do more than think.<br> You must search for another place<br> while you still have one.<br> Now, promise you will<br> do that at least. please.<br> All right. Thank you.<br> Miss Schlegel.<br> Come and tell us when you've found<br> another place, orjust come anyway.<br> And don't say no.<br> Don't dare to say no.<br> And don't forget your umbrella<br> or you'll say we pinched it.<br> You ought to be more careful. Miss Schlegel.<br> Your servants ought to have orders<br> not to let such people in.<br> Oh, but we invited him in.<br> Yes. we wanted to see him again,<br> and talk to him and maybe help him...<br> - not only in a practical way.<br> - You're too kind.<br> You behave too well to people<br> and then they impose on you.<br> I know the world and that type of man.<br> Oh, but he is not a type. Mr. Wilcox.<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - No. I think he is a quite<br> unusualyoung man.<br> And he has something in him.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> Except that he wants<br> something better than he's got.<br> - Oh.<br> - Yes.<br> He has a sort of romantic ambition.<br> It is your view of him<br> that is romantic. Miss Schlegel.<br> Evie.<br> We wish you to have something<br> to remember Mrs. Wilcox by...<br> in return for your kindness<br> to her in those days.<br> Oh, thank you so much.<br> What a lovely thought.<br> Thank you.<br> She would want you to have it.<br> She spoke very fondly ofyou.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Are you sure?<br> Is it 1 8th century?<br> It must be crystal.<br> Thank you. Thank you. Evie.<br> - So what does she look like?<br> - A sort of an old-maid type.<br> Goodness knows why Father<br> wanted me to ask her.<br> She talks and talks <br> Here she is.<br> - Miss Schlegel.<br> - Hello. Miss Wilcox.<br> How do you do?<br> This is my fiance, Percy Cahill.<br> How do you do?<br> - Ah, good afternoon.<br> - Hello. I didn't expect to see you.<br> Well. Evie told me of her little plot,<br> so I just slipped in and secured a table.<br> Always secure a table first.<br> Evie, sit there.<br> - Miss Schlegel. ifyou please. here.<br> - Thank you very much.<br> Mr. Cahill, there.<br> Well, are you still worrying around<br> after your young clerks?<br> - I hope you're hungry.<br> - Famished. I want to eat heaps.<br> Good. What will you have?<br> - Fish pie.<br> - Ah. fish pie.<br> Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson's.<br> It's not a good thing to go for here.<br> - Go for something for me then.<br> - Right. uh...<br> roast beef and<br> Yorkshire pudding and...<br> - What will you have?<br> - cider to drink.<br> - That's the type of thing to go for.<br> - I'll have trout.<br> I like this place for a joke<br> once in a while.<br> It's so thoroughly old English.<br> Don't you agree?<br> I began an inventory<br> of our possessions.<br> There are over 300 things<br> in the drawing room alone <br> Oh, thank you. Lovely.<br> And that's not counting the books.<br> Whatever shall I do?<br> - You see, modern ownership ofmoveables...<br> -[ Whispering ] I told you.<br> -is reducing us again to a nomadic hoard.<br> -How awful.<br> We are reverting to a civilization<br> ofluggage, Mr. Wilcox.<br> - [ Chuckling ]<br> - Thank you.<br> - Thank you. sir.<br> Always tip the carver.<br> Tip everywhere is my motto.<br> - Perhaps it does make life more human.<br> - Then these fellows remember one again.<br> Especially in the East.<br> Ifyou tip. they remember you<br> from year's end to year's end.<br> - Have you been in the East?<br> - Yes, Greece and the Levant.<br> I used to go for sport<br> and business to Cyprus.<br> A few piastres properly distributed<br> help to keep one's memory green.<br> - [ Margaret ] How shockingly cynical.<br> - Not a bit. Simply realistic.<br> Excuse me. sir.<br> How would you like your beef done?<br> - Well done.<br> - Well done.<br> You don't like cheese.<br> You never take cheese.<br> - Percy, I adore cheese.<br> - You said you didn't like it.<br> That's the most despicable lie. Percy.<br> You've gone quite pink.<br> - I haven't gone pink.<br> -Your ears have gone pink about the tips.<br> - I have not.<br> - [ Henry] Evie, I like that.<br> Miss Schlegel expects me to act<br> as house agent for her.<br> [ Chuckling ]<br> I want a new home in September.<br> and someone must find it. I can't.<br> Do you know of anything, Percy?<br> Can't say I do.<br> I wish you would give us Howards End.<br> - Howards End, I'm afraid, is let.<br> - Can't you turn out your tenant<br> and let it to us?<br> No.<br> [ Sighs ]<br> We're nearly demented.<br> Mr. Wilcox, I am demented.<br> One bit of advice: Fix your district.<br> fix your price, then don't budge.<br> That's how I got Ducie Street<br> and Oniton.<br> Well, I shall, uh <br> I shall look around a bit for you.<br> - Would you?<br> - Yes.<br> - Wouldyou really? How kind.<br> - Yes.<br> But I warn you.<br> the house has not been built...<br> that would suit the Schlegel family.<br> - It's no fun trying to help us.<br> - Fun?<br> No. but it's a pleasure<br> and a privilege...<br> to do whatever I can<br> for Miss Margaret Schlegel.<br> Thank you very much.<br> [ Henry ]<br> Dear Miss Schlegel...<br> dare I intrude<br> on your holiday in Devon...<br> and requestyou<br> to come up to London...<br> where, I may add,<br> you are greatly missed?<br> Matter is ofsome urgency.<br> But to interrupt your holiday.<br> dear Margaret...<br> and before we have<br> undertaken our excursions.<br> You haven't been<br> to Nine Barrows Downs.<br> I know. Aunt Juley,<br> But I shall be back before long.<br> Let me go up to town today...<br> and take the house<br> if it's the least bit possible.<br> I don't understand.<br> Whose house is this?<br> Mr. Wilcox's, Tibby.<br> You are being remarkably obtuse.<br> Are you doing it on purpose?<br> Look. "Owing to<br> changed circumstances" <br> He means that Evie's getting married.<br> That's his daughter.<br> "I no longer have need<br> for a London house of this size..."<br> "and am willing to let it<br> on a yearly tenancy."<br> - That's perfect.<br> - Out of all our hotel acquaintances...<br> Mr. Wilcox is the only one who's stuck,<br> yet we've met far more interesting people.<br> Interesting people<br> don't get one houses.<br> I shall never forget<br> that dreadful motor driver...<br> that perfectly dreadful Charles.<br> My one consolation is that for once<br> I was able to be useful to you girls.<br> Thank you. Aunt J uley.<br> And now it is<br> my turn to be useful.<br> This is the ballroom.<br> Goodness. oh.<br> - Like it?<br> - Rather!<br> Even I know a good thing<br> when I see it.<br> Yes. but nowadays, with. uh,<br> Evie always out with her fiance...<br> when I get home in the evenings.<br> I tell you I can't stand the place.<br> - It would be very lonely for you.<br> - Yes.<br> Do you ever get lonely, Miss Schlegel?<br> I soon shall, horribly.<br> It's heartbreaking<br> to leave one's old home.<br> Goodness. how high<br> this ceiling must be.<br> H mm?<br> Yes. it must be over 30 feet.<br> No. maybe 40, I should think.<br> Perhaps even more.<br> Miss Schlegel. uh...<br> I've had you here<br> on false pretenses.<br> I want to speak on a much more<br> serious matter than the house.<br> Uh...<br> do you think you could<br> be induced to share?<br> I mean, is it at all<br> probable that <br> Oh, yes. I see.<br> Miss Schlegel.<br> Margaret.<br> - I don't think you quite understand.<br> - Oh, yes. I ndeed. yes.<br> - I'm asking you to be my wife.<br> - Yes. I know. I know.<br> - Are you offended?<br> - How could I be?<br> Well, perhaps I should've written first.<br> No. no. Rather, you will<br> receive a letter from me.<br> - Thankyou.<br> - Not at all.<br> And it's you I thank.<br> Uh...<br> should I order<br> the motor round now?<br> That would be most kind.<br> [ Charles ] Warning you, Evie,<br> she will never set foot in this house!<br> - [ Evie ] It's not my fault!<br> - Of course it's your fault.<br> Going around hobnobbing<br> with those Schlegel girls.<br> - Girls? They're hardly girls.<br> - [ Thunder Rumbling ]<br> I never dreamt of such a thing.<br> Dad took me to call...<br> and then made me<br> ask her to Simpson's, that's all.<br> Well, I'm altogether off Dad.<br> - [ Baby Crying ]<br> - You've woken didums. I knew you would.<br> Well. Miss Schlegel's<br> fairly got us on toast.<br> You know. she always meant<br> to get hold of Howards End.<br> Now. thanks to you. she's got it.<br> - I call that most unfair.<br> - Oh. Evie.<br> Why don't you pretend<br> to break offyour engagement?<br> Then perhaps your father will<br> also quarrel with Miss Schlegel.<br> - Stop talking nonsense, darling.<br> - I'm jolly well going to get married<br> as soon as possible.<br> - And Dad can do what he likes.<br> - She's taking Mother's place.<br> - The idea!<br> - I could simply scratch<br> that woman's eyes out.<br> - Toto. Toto, play.<br> - Come on, Dolly.<br> I'll have a try.<br> Come on.<br> Well, it's no use talking.<br> We're in a bad hole<br> and must make the best of it.<br> But I'll keep my eye<br> on those Schlegels.<br> And if I find them putting on airs...<br> - with their artistic beastliness...<br> - [ Baby Continues Crying ]<br> I intend to put my foot down.<br> - Yes, firmly.<br> - [ Thunderclap ]<br> [ Henry]<br> I've had a letter too. Not a nice one.<br> I want to talk it over with you.<br> My letter is about Howards End.<br> The tenants have decamped.<br> And what is worse, he's trying<br> to sublet the house, Margaret.<br> Here, he's trying to sublet the house.<br> What are you laughing at?<br> Henry...<br> you haven't had a chance<br> for a talk with Helen yet, have you?<br> - What do you mean, a talk with her?<br> - Well, do before you go.<br> - Why? What's the matter?<br> - Oh. nothing.<br> -I'm just anxious you two should be friends.<br> - We've always hit it offtogether.<br> - [ Margaret ] Shh.<br> - Well, we do.<br> There's no clause in the agreement<br> to allow subletting.<br> There you are. Read it yourself.<br> That's awfully jolly.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Yes. Especially that. Foxgloves.<br> Yes. dear old digitalis.<br> - Digitalis, sounds like a sneeze.<br> - [ Chuckling ]<br> - Margaret! Such nice news from Mr. Bast.<br> -Really? Good.<br> Here we all are then.<br> - Mr. Bast is now with Dempster's Bank.<br> That's his news.<br> - Good.<br> Thanks to your hint,<br> he cleared out of the Porphyrion.<br> Not a bad business, the Porphyrion.<br> Margaret. I shall have to go<br> to Howards End and take charge.<br> - And I would like you to come with me.<br> - Not a bad business?<br> - Yes, I would like that very much.<br> - Good. What about tomorrow?<br> - Tomorrow? Oh. no. I couldn't well do that.<br> - Why not?<br> You told us the Porphyrion<br> would smash before Christmas.<br> Did I? Yes.<br> Well. it was outside<br> the tariff ring at the time.<br> Took some rather bad policies.<br> But, uh. lately, it came in.<br> Safe as houses now.<br> What's wrong with tomorrow?<br> Aunt Juley would be<br> so disappointed if I left now.<br> - Didn't Mr. Wilcox clearly tell us<br> that the Porphyrion would <br> - Yes, let's talk about it later, shall we?<br> - Henry, Aunt Juley regards<br> this visit as a high solemnity <br> - It turns out that it's safe as houses.<br> And M r. Bast need never have left<br> and taken another post...<br> - at a greatly reduced salary.<br> - My dear Helen.<br> I grieve for your clerk, I really do.<br> But it is all part<br> of the battle of life.<br> - Battle of life?<br> - Yes.<br> A man who had little money<br> has less. owing to us.<br> Oh, come, come. You're not to blame.<br> No one is to blame.<br> -No one? Is no one to blame for anything?<br> - I didn't say that.<br> - You take things far too seriously.<br> - [AuntJuley ] Margaret.<br> There's your aunt.<br> I'll go and have a word with her.<br> - [AuntJuley ] Margaret!<br> - Helen.<br> Helen, a word of advice.<br> I require no more advice.<br> Don't take up a sentimental<br> attitude over the poor.<br> See that she doesn't, Margaret.<br> The poor are poor.<br> One is sorry for them, but there it is.<br> I'll talk to Aunt Juley about tomorrow.<br> Don't you bother.<br> [ Aunt Juley ]<br> Girls, aren't you cold?<br> Helen, I am very sorry about Mr. Bast.<br> but you must be civil to Henry.<br> - You yourself are a witness.<br> - Yes, I know there may be another side<br> to this question.<br> But Henry is my future husband...<br> and I must be on his side.<br> Why are you so bitter, dearie?<br> - Hmm?<br> - Because I'm an old maid.<br> Oh, Helen.<br> No. darling.<br> Helen!<br> - Margaret will explain.<br> - Margaret. Magsy.<br> If it isn't true surely<br> what Mr. Wilcox is saying...<br> - that you want to go away tomorrow?<br> - Yes, we must leave tomorrow.<br> [ Henry ]<br> I have business at Howards End...<br> and my business is now also,<br> unfortunately, my Margaret's.<br> [ Margaret ] So we'll go<br> for our walk now. See you at tea time.<br> Unless it rains. In which case.<br> we'll see you a great deal sooner. Bye.<br> Have a good walk.<br> -Yes. that's him.<br> -[ Margaret ] So this is the famous office?<br> - What?<br> - I'd expected something more African.<br> Oh, heavens. no.<br> [ Laughs ]<br> Spears, animal skins and that sort ofthing.<br> But I suppose this is the imperial part...<br> of the Imperial and West African<br> Rubber Company.<br> Yes. we haven't settled the question<br> of the London house, have we?<br> - Well. it all depends, doesn't it?<br> - On what?<br> - When do you want to marry me?<br> - [ Chuckles ] How you do fly around.<br> - My head's in a whirl. Let's dance!<br> - [ Both Laughing ]<br> - [ Margaret ] Be careful!<br> - [ Henry Vocalizing ]<br> - Oh, Charles.<br> - I hope that my wife <br> How do you do <br> will give you a decent lunch...<br> after you've had a good look<br> at Howards End.<br> I can hardly wait to see it,<br> although I almost feel I have.<br> I don't know<br> in what state you'll find it.<br> The tenant decamped without even arranging<br> for a charwoman to clear up after him.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> - Yes. I've more than a little bone<br> to pick with that tenant.<br> - Margaret, here's an idea.<br> - Yes?<br> Why don't we use Howards End to store<br> your furniture from Wickham Place...<br> tillyou decide what to do with it?<br> - Oh, wouldyou? Wouldyou really?<br> - Good idea?<br> Oh, how kind.<br> Only until Helen and Tibby<br> are settled of course, Charles.<br> I hope you won't be disappointed.<br> It's quite a measly little place.<br> - Never really suited us.<br> - Heavens, no.<br> [ Dolly Coughs ]<br> - Oh. it's lovely.<br> - Margaret.<br> - Oh. dear.<br> - What?<br> - I seem to have forgotten the keys.<br> - What?<br> - I've lost the keys.<br> - Crane. we'll have to go back.<br> - Won't you leave me here?<br> - You sure?<br> Yes, yes.

Where?<br> - The pigs' teeth in the bark.<br> Yes. look. J ust here.<br> You see? Four feet up.<br> - How extraordinary.<br> - Yes, and you chew the bark...<br> - to cure the toothache.<br> - What a rum notion.<br> Surely, you knew that.<br> Did that silly old Miss Avery<br> give you a fright. Margaret?<br> None ofyou girls has any nerve.<br> [ Laughing ]<br> Did you take her for a spook?<br> She's very odd.<br> She carries on as if<br> she owned Howards End.<br> Miss Avery has always<br> lived on the place?<br> Yes. she grew up there<br> on the farm like M rs. Wilcox.<br> Weren't she and Mrs. Wilcox friends<br> when Howards End too was a farm?<br> They do say that Mrs. Wilcox<br> had a brother, or was it an uncle?<br> Anyhow, he popped the question.<br> And Miss Avery. she said no.<br> Just imagine if she'd said yes.<br> She'd have been Charles's aunt.<br> Oh, I say, that's rather good.<br> Charlie's aunt.<br> I must chaff him about that.<br> [ Dolly ]<br> She's so mad about Howards End.<br> Goodness knows what she'll do when<br> your furniture gets there, Margaret.<br> She might fling it all out.<br> Or she might simply adopt it<br> for Howards End.<br> Excuse me. sir. Where would I go<br> to inquire about a position?<br> What position<br> would that be, sir?<br> I heard there was one.<br> Not at this time.<br> I thought it was you.<br> How do you do?<br> Why did you never come<br> to see us again? You promised.<br> But this isn't your bank.<br> You took a situation with Dempster's.<br> - I lost it.<br> - Sorry?<br> I lost the situation.<br> They cut back on their staff and<br> the last to join, like me...<br> were the first to be let go.<br> I've been inquiring<br> for another place here.<br> The way they look at you<br> when you come to ask.<br> They're sure you've stolen something or why else<br> would any decent person be out of work?<br> - It's our fault.<br> - No.<br> No. we made you leave the Porphyrion.<br> I and my sister and Mr. Wilcox...<br> who is at this very moment<br> celebrating his daughter's wedding...<br> at his castle in Shropshire...<br> with the maximum expense<br> and ostentation. of course.<br> I could murder him!<br> "Murder will out, it is most foul."<br> How have you been, Miss Schlegel?<br> Any interesting lectures?<br> You know. he jolly well<br> owes you a situation.<br> [ Margaret ] What nice houses you have<br> all over the place. I like this one too.<br> [ Henry ] Oniton Grange.<br> waiting to get it offmy hands.<br> - Why?<br> - Well, what is one to do?<br> The shooting is bad<br> and the fishing is even worse.<br> Anyway, it's in the wrong<br> part ofShropshire.<br> Henry, are these all Wilcoxes?<br> Heavens, no.<br> I bought the place<br> lock, stock and barrel.<br> The fellow just took the money<br> and cleared off to Italy, I think.<br> I'm told some of these are rather good.<br> What do you think?<br> - I think they're lovely.<br> - Rather good, isn't it?<br> - Which one?<br> - Top one.<br> - Yes, very grand. It's rather like you.<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> So, I'll show you the cellar.<br> - It's very damp. isn't it?<br> - [ Chattering, Laughing ]<br> - Uh. do you have enough ice now?<br> - Yes. sir.<br> - Second orders?<br> - Yes. sir.<br> - Good.

Yes. here we are.<br> Charles, as the eldest.<br> will someday have Howards End.<br> I'm just anxious not to be<br> unjust to the others.<br> Of course not.<br> You mean money?<br> -Yes, money. since you put it so frankly.<br> -Goodness.<br> We'll never get through all this wine.<br> - How much have you got?<br> - What?<br> How much have you got<br> a year? I have 600.<br> My income?<br> - Don't you know your income? [ Laughing ]<br> - Of course I do.<br> Don't you want to tell it me?<br> Do it this way. Ifyou were to<br> divide your income into 1 0 parts...<br> how many parts would you give<br> to Charles. to Evie and to Paul?<br> Go ahead. Give away<br> all you can. Be generous.<br> You don't beat<br> about the bush, do you?<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - No.<br> [ Charles ] I suppose she'll get her hands<br> on this place as well as Howards End.<br> It's only her furniture<br> that's gone there.<br> That's the thin edge<br> of the wedge.<br> I don't know what's to happen to us, Dolly.<br> Two children to bring up.<br> Charles, you are pleased<br> about the baby. aren't you?<br> What?<br> Oh, pleased as punch.<br> Pleased as punch.<br> Though it's not<br> going to be easy.<br> The pater wants to be fair.<br> but money isn't elastic.<br> What if Evie has a family?<br> - Or the pater himself?<br> - [ Chuckles ]<br> - What?<br> - Shh.<br> Who's there?<br> Saxon or Celt?<br> [ All Chattering ]<br> Evie! Good-bye!<br> Good-bye!<br> It went like clockwork.<br> "Quite like a Durbar."<br> Lady Edser said.<br> Ah. You did awfully well.<br> I'm very proud ofyou.<br> Thank you.<br> It was very successful.<br> - [ Henry ] Who are those people?<br> - [ Margaret ] Well...<br> perhaps they're townspeople<br> come to see the wedding presents.<br> Ifyou'll gracefully vanish,<br> I'll deal with them.<br> What is it?<br> What's wrong? Is Tibby ill?<br> They're starving!<br> I found them starving!<br> - Who's starving?<br> - The Basts.<br> He's lost his place because he's been<br> turned out of Dempster's bank.<br> They reduced their staff,<br> and he was the first to go.<br> Yes. thanks to us, he's done for.<br> - We've ruined him.<br> - Are you mad?<br> Ifyou like.

In fact. Tibby<br> particularly mentioned them this morning.<br> Don't tell me. Tibby,<br> that it is still that business...<br> over Henry and that woman.<br> Mrs. Bast.<br> Goodness me. How morbid.<br> His wife forgives him...<br> and his sister-in-law cannot bear<br> to look upon his face.<br> I don't believe it.<br> Not even of Helen.<br> [ Tibby ]<br> We know to what extremes Helen goes.<br> We've all suffered<br> under her temperament.<br> But this is different. This is<br> not temperament, but a kind of madness <br> as if she were mad.<br> Margaret. you've got black marks<br> again under your eyes.<br> You know that's strictly forbidden.<br> don't you?<br> I'll not have my girl<br> looking as old as her husband.<br> - You haven't quite seen our point.<br> - I don't suppose I ever shall.<br> Our point is this:<br> Our sister may be mad.<br> Oh, Charles, do come in.<br> We are again in trouble.<br> - Can you help us at all?<br> - No, I'm afraid I cannot.<br> What were the facts? We're all mad.<br> more or less. these days.<br> The facts are that our sister has been<br> in England three days and won't see us.<br> She's forbidden the bankers<br> to give us her address.<br> She refuses to answer any questions.<br> All we have are these telegrams.<br> And you want to get hold of her.<br> is that it?<br> - Well... yes.<br> - [ Henry ] Perfectly easy, Margaret.<br> She wants her books, yes?<br> Send her after them to Howards End.<br> When she's there. you just stroll in.<br> Ifthere's nothing wrong<br> with her, so much the better.<br> But remember <br> the motor will be around the corner.<br> We quite simply run her<br> up to London to a specialist.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - Why is it impossible?<br> Because Helen and I, we...<br> don't speak that particular language...<br> ifyou see my meaning.<br> Yes. because you have scruples.<br> And I understand perfectly.<br> I'm as scrupulous<br> as any man alive, I hope.<br> But when it is a case like this <br> When it is a question of madness <br> - I deny it's madness.<br> - You said yourself.<br> It's madness when I say it.<br> but not when you say it.<br> Pater. you may as well<br> keep Howards End out of it.<br> Why, Charles?<br> Well, the whole house is at sixes<br> and sevens.

One point at a time.<br> Please. Sit down.<br> Margaret...<br> I must now ask you<br> the name of her seducer.<br> You may have some inkling.<br> and the slightest hint would help us.<br> - "Us"? Who is "us"?<br> - Hmm?<br> Well, I thought it best<br> to ring Charles.<br> That was unnecessary.<br> My dear. listen to me.<br> Charles and I wish to act<br> in your sister's best interests.<br> It's still not too late<br> to clear her name.<br> What are we <br> to make her seducer marry her?<br> But Henry. suppose he turned out<br> to be married already?<br> - One has heard of such cases.<br> - Margaret.<br> Then he must pay heavily<br> for his misconduct. mustn't he?<br> Now. stay calm.<br> I want to talk to you.<br> Listen to me. Margaret.<br> Come here.<br> Look at me.<br> What's the matter?<br> - Hmm?<br> - May I ask you my question now?<br> - Certainly.<br> - Tomorrow Helen goes to Germany.<br> - Yes.<br> - I'm fine.<br> - Tonight. with your permission...<br> - Yes?<br> she would like to sleep<br> at Howards End.<br> Heav <br> But why at Howards End?<br> I don't understand.<br> It is an odd request, but you know<br> what women in her state are.<br> I could understand if it were<br> her own home associations and so on.<br> But Helen has no associations<br> with Howards End.<br> I don't see why she wants to stay there.<br> She'll only catch cold anyway.<br> - Call it fancy. but she wants to.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - If she wants to sleep there one night.<br> she'll want to sleep there two.<br> - No, no. Just <br> - And she'll never get out of the house.<br> - That matters so very much?<br> - Of course it would. It's Charles's <br> - No, no.<br> We will only trouble<br> Howards End for this one night.<br> - I shall stay with her <br> - No. That's quite impossible.<br> - I want you here to meet Charles.<br> - What has Charles to do with this?<br> As the future owner of Howards End.<br> it has everything to do with Charles.<br> - In what way?

Henry.<br> Your sister can sleep at the hotel.<br> I have my children...<br> and the memory<br> of my dear wife to consider.<br> You have mentioned<br> M rs.
