                        - Thanks for the lift.<br> - Where will you look?<br> I don't know, but if I find a pink Cadillac,<br> he'll be around somewhere.<br> So long.<br> - Who's that?<br> - It's Lon.<br> I'm making chilli,<br> but if you want breakfast I'll come out.<br> No, thanks. You seen my uncle Hud?<br> I chicken-fried him a steak last night<br> about seven. Haven't seen him since.<br> All right.<br> Daisy, I'm taking two doughnuts.<br> OK, honey,<br> just leave a dime on the counter.<br> All right.<br> It's 26 after 6 on a Thursday, it's<br> on the Bobby Don Brewer Show.<br> Must have had quite a brawl in here.<br> I had Hud in here last night is what I had.<br> Sure looks it.<br> Mr Larker.<br> - Hey there, Mr Larker!<br> - Hey there, Lon!<br> - You gonna rodeo this year?<br> - I ain't looking to get stepped on.<br> - Why're you in town this early?<br> - Trying to run down Hud.<br> Didn't I see his big Cadillac<br> parked down the street?<br> Pretty sure I did.<br> I wouldn't disturb him if I was you.<br> I ain't dying to,<br> but I've been told to get him.<br> Hud?<br> Hud!<br> Honcho, I just hope for your sake<br> that this house is on fire.<br> I'm sorry,<br> but we got trouble at the ranch.<br> You got trouble right here.<br> I was getting nicely tucked in,<br> you come tiptoeing through the tulips.<br> Granddad wants you<br> and he said right now.<br> He said right now?<br> Do you think it would be all right with<br> my daddy if I buttoned up my shirt?<br> Oh, come on, will you?<br> You got me out of the wrong side of bed<br> this morning. Don't snap at my heels.<br> I'm liable to turn around and bite you.<br> Thank you, honey.<br> Hey, hi, Joe.<br> Which one of you two's coming out<br> of my house at six in the morning?<br> I asked you a question.<br> Which one, damn it?<br> I hate to have to tell you as it's my own<br> nephew, but it's this snot-nosed kid.<br> I'll kill that little punk.<br> Wait a minute!<br> You got diabetes.<br> I'll handle this for you.<br> I can do it myself. Out of my way.<br> Now, Joe, you can't afford<br> to get worked up, buddy boy.<br> I'll lower his temperature some,<br> I promise you.<br> All right, hot shot. We're going to finish<br> this discussion behind the woodshed.<br> Thanks a whole lot!<br> Relax, you can charge a stud fee<br> by the time that story gets around.<br> If I'm still alive.<br> I could've gotten hurt back there.<br> So could I. Ain't it lucky you were handy?<br> - You should take me along as a regular.<br> - Pace would kill you, sonny.<br> What's so important my daddy<br> has to drag me back on my day off?<br> - He wants to ask your advice.<br> - Ask me?<br> He hasn't asked me<br> about anything in 15 years.<br> I just work out there<br> from the shoulders down myself.<br> Can you make it all day,<br> after last night?<br> I ain't 100 years old like him.<br> I don't need a week's sleep to be fresh.<br> He can't help being an old man.<br> You sure drive this thing.<br> That'll be Hud.<br> Parked right in my flower bed.<br> - Good morning, Hud.<br> - Morning.<br> I'm sorry to cut into your time off.<br> Lonnie, close that screen door.<br> The house is still standing,<br> you're drinking coffee as usual,<br> why push the panic button?<br> We come up with a dead heifer<br> in the night.<br> You dragged me back here<br> for a dead cow?<br> I'm worried about this one. She wasn't<br> cut or crippled-looking. No swelling.<br> - Any Johnson grass around?<br> - No.<br> This may be something<br> I ought to know about.<br> Jos and Jesse are<br> keeping off the buzzards.<br> Stay out of those berries,<br> they're for the pie.<br> Let's not stand around.<br> I got things to do.<br> Watch that cigarette ash,<br> it's going in the pot.<br> I'll go bring the pick-up around.<br> How come you always<br> run over my zinnias?<br> I've been trying<br> to get them to come up.<br> - Don't plant 'em where I park.<br> - You're cheerful.<br> Missy, your job is to keep house,<br> not worry about my disposition.<br> Frying pan's still on. Want eggs?<br> Or did you have breakfast in bed?<br> Nope, we hadn't quite<br> gotten around to breakfast.<br> - Morning, boys.<br> - Mr Bannon.<br> Pretty hard to keep them birds away.<br> Had to use a flashlight all night.<br> Look at them buzzards. They'll be back.<br> You couldn't scare 'em off with artillery.<br> I wish you wouldn't do that.<br> They keep the country clean.<br> Besides, there's a law<br> against killing buzzards.<br> I always say the law was meant to be<br> interpreted in a lenient manner.<br> I try to do that. Sometimes I lean<br> to one side of it, sometimes the other.<br> I don't like to break the law.<br> Well, she ain't gonna sit up<br> and tell us herself.<br> What do you think, Hud?<br> I don't know. She looks clean to me.<br> Something killed her.<br> I'll call the state vet. He might know.<br> This is our land.<br> I don't want government men on it.<br> Any time, any place. This ain't nothing.<br> Let the buzzards have her.<br> No, I don't believe I will.<br> I'll call the government man<br> and ask him to take a look.<br> Bring someone in to tell you how to run<br> your business, just don't ask my opinion.<br> I'd like you and Lon<br> to stay out here for a while.<br> I'll take these boys back with me<br> so they can snooze a little.<br> Lon, you take that water bag<br> so you won't parch.<br> Why don't you sit with our sick friend?<br> I got a healthy one in town<br> that won't wait.<br> It's a good thing you showed up.<br> We blew a tyre<br> and I gotta get this stuff back.<br> - Need help, Jesse?<br> - I'm all right, Hud, thanks.<br> You think your hand would fall off<br> if you opened the door?<br> - Did you pick up my beer?<br> - Two six-packs. Enough till tomorrow.<br> - Keeping count on me?<br> - I keep tripping over those empties.<br> Somebody smells of Chanel No. 5.<br> It isn't me. I can't afford it.<br> You sure weren't riding the range<br> this afternoon.<br> - I sure wasn't.<br> - No.<br> I wish I knew where some girls<br> get the time.<br> By the time I finish scrubbing the floor,<br> cleaning the bathtub, hanging clothes...<br> - They just drop everything, honey.<br> - I suppose it does beat housework.<br> - Want an orange? I'll peel it for you.<br> - No, thanks.<br> Look, it says "Florida" on it.<br> We grow 'em right here in Texas<br> and they send them in from Florida.<br> That makes sense, doesn't it?<br> Yeah.<br> The checker at the A and P market<br> says you're seeing Truman Peters' wife.<br> Is that what he says?<br> He says she got a bad temper. Her maid<br> quit because she hollers so much.<br> Well, our maid's gonna get canned<br> 'cause she's talking too much.<br> - You want a Fig Newton?<br> - No.<br> Just leave a little something for dinner,<br> will you?<br> You still eating bread?<br> After steak and flour gravy, hominy,<br> fried okra and onions, and hot rolls?<br> May have looked a lot,<br> but it melted away.<br> - Hud didn't want dinner?<br> - He's prettying up. He'll eat later.<br> What's for dessert?<br> You think a freezer-full<br> of peach ice cream would do?<br> I've been waiting all winter<br> for those Alberta peaches.<br> That's what you've been waiting for?<br> How about those peachy pin-ups<br> you hide with your socks?<br> That's private. Stay out of there.<br> I'm a girl.<br> They don't do a thing for me.<br> I'll dish up the ice cream on the porch.<br> It's cooler.<br> That'll be fine, Alma.<br> Go on, before you wet your didy.<br> Alma!<br> Yeah?<br> Give me a clean white shirt.<br> You're big with "please"<br> and "thank you".<br> Please get off your lazy butt<br> and get me a clean shirt. Thank you.<br> - Had trouble getting the lipstick out.<br> - Let's try yours. It might wash out easier.<br> - Let's not.<br> - You ain't getting any younger.<br> - What are you saving it for?<br> - Tabs are in the collar.<br> - Hear the whippoorwill?<br> - I think there's two of 'em.<br> I've never seen one of those birds.<br> All you do is hear 'em calling.<br> What are you thinking about, Lon?<br> I don't know. Just looking up<br> ahead, I guess. To what's coming.<br> Thinking about your worries<br> and ambitions?<br> Yeah, that and having a car<br> of my own to tear around in. And girls.<br> I expect you'll get your share of what's<br> good. A boy like you deserves it.<br> It's getting late.<br> My daddy sure looks like<br> his collar was choking him.<br> - Those were his Sunday best.<br> - I don't remember him any.<br> I do.<br> You don't carry a picture<br> of Hud, do you?<br> No, I don't.<br> But he's your son,<br> same as my dad was.<br> Yep, he is.<br> - What are you holding against him?<br> - He knows and you don't need to.<br> - There you go.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Ain't you having any?<br> - I'm trying to lose a couple of pounds.<br> I'll do those dishes later.<br> I've got to get off these feet.<br> - Kitchen's your department, Alma.<br> - Seen enough of it for today.<br> Are you planning on<br> going back to town tonight?<br> I didn't get washed up<br> to sit on the porch.<br> I'd like you to be back here before<br> morning. The vet'll be here early.<br> All right. It's pretty good. Peachy.<br> You can't get much<br> air through this nylon.<br> You ought to wear a sarong,<br> like in the South Seas.<br> Oh, yeah, that would be a lot of laughs.<br> You're half native already.<br> I've never seen you in shoes.<br> I wore 'em once.<br> To get married in. White satin pumps.<br> I don't have 'em any more.<br> Or the man, either.<br> I'm going to get into town.<br> Alma, you want to blow<br> some foam off some beer?<br> No, thanks.<br> I'm going to get up out of this swing.<br> Set some biscuits. Go to bed.<br> I'll settle for half that action.<br> I'll go with you, Hud.<br> What you got lined up, sport?<br> A SnoCone or something?<br> No, I just thought<br> I'd catch a ride with you, that's all.<br> All right, come on, let's make tracks.<br> - Did you need me, Granddad?<br> - No, you go on.<br> Just be careful.<br> You drive, sport.<br> - What was that all about?<br> - I'll tell you someday when I'm drunk.<br> Gig this thing a little, will you?<br> - It's a lonesome old night, isn't it?<br> - Ain't they all?<br> I love that sound. Goes right through me.<br> Scares the hell out of the cattle.<br> - Know what trains make me think of?<br> - I've a strong feeling you'll tell me.<br> I guess I just like 'em, that's all.<br> Keys.<br> Well, golly!<br> Look at that Las Vegas saddle.<br> You couldn't lift that<br> on a horse with a crane.<br> - It is pretty noisy.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - Just tagging along.<br> - Not with me.<br> Go tie on a couple of Dr Pepper's.<br> I'll see ya.<br> - Hi, Mr Kirby.<br> - Hi.<br> - Read that one?<br> - Yeah, twice.<br> - About the best book you ever had.<br> - Pretty steamy, ain't it?<br> I don't know. People seem<br> a lot like the ones I see.<br> Did you read the part where the<br> sergeant gets her for the first time?<br> Yeah, I read that part.<br> I sure have seen<br> an awful lot of you for one night.<br> I'm just headed for the square, is all.<br> Where're you headed?<br> Just to keep you up to date,<br> I'm going to Mrs Ruby Fletcher's house.<br> I don't think that's a house<br> you've heard much about.<br> I've heard some. I am out of my<br> three-cornered pants, you know.<br> - I have been for some time.<br> - How old are you?<br> A fast seventeen? Boy, when I was...<br> When I was your age,<br> I couldn't get enough of anything.<br> That was the summer you were born.<br> Your ma died. And your daddy<br> was feeling a little wild about things.<br> We bought us a '27 Chevy.<br> Kept it tied together with bailing wire,<br> hit every honky-tonk in the country.<br> I don't know which we run the hardest,<br> that car or them country girls,<br> came to them dances.<br> Boy, we do-se-doed and chased<br> a lot of girlish butts that summer.<br> I wouldn't mind going that route myself.<br> Come on along.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> All right.<br> Hey, wake up. Come on, Lonnie.<br> Open your eyes.<br> - You gonna stay here till dinner?<br> - What do you want?<br> I want you to get up. I can't stay here<br> wrassling with you all morning.<br> - Why not? I like it.<br> - I bet. That's enough. Now, get up.<br> - Can't do that, Alma.<br> - Are you sleeping in the raw again?<br> There's pyjamas in there.<br> How come you're not using them?<br> - They strangle me.<br> - Come on.<br> - What do you sleep in?<br> - In my own room, with the door locked.<br> - Ever wear any shorty things?<br> - What kind of question is that?<br> - Just wondering.<br> - Your mind usually run that way?<br> - It seems to.<br> - Boys with impure thoughts get acne.<br> - Did you know that?<br> - That's all bull.<br> Keep it up. You'll see.<br> Hurry up!<br> The vet's coming this morning.<br> Let's get away from this stink.<br> I've got all I need here.<br> I'm going to ask you<br> to get your cattle together.<br> All of them.<br> I'll have to make an inspection.<br> - Inspection for what?<br> - For what killed that heifer.<br> I hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid<br> you've got the worst kind of trouble.<br> I think that cow died<br> of foot and mouth disease.<br> Oh, me. I never thought<br> it would be anything like that.<br> Let's have it. What are we in for?<br> Get your herds together.<br> We'll take some samples.<br> Bring in a few calves, some horses,<br> infect them artificially,<br> then wait and see what happens.<br> I'll tell you. They turn up sick,<br> you kill 'em, right?<br> If the calves turn up sick and the horses<br> don't, it's foot and mouth. We've got to.<br> The last bad outbreak, the government<br> had to kill 77,000 cattle,<br> plus that many sheep and goats,<br> even 20,000 deer.<br> It's a terrible thing.<br> I just bought 20 head<br> of Mexican cows down south.<br> - Could they be the bad ones?<br> - Could be.<br> If they were, you'll have to get rid of<br> every cow that's been near them.<br> You're talking about<br> all the animals I own.<br> I know I am.<br> I hope I'm wrong<br> and that it's something else.<br> So we won't ever have to<br> talk about it again.<br> Looks like I landed<br> in the wrong place again.<br> You guys get on,<br> there's some fence to fix.<br> Man, how about that?<br> You going to let them shoot your cows<br> on account of a schoolbook disease?<br> You getting that old, Homer?<br> I wonder if a long quarantine wouldn't<br> satisfy 'em. Think they'd agree to that?<br> They don't have to agree to nothing.<br> They're the law.<br> You can agree with them till hell<br> freezes over.<br> But that Mr Burris<br> seemed like a reasonable man.<br> Think they'd come and liquidate?<br> Hell, yeah,<br> you got what they say you got.<br> You've had 24 of my 34 years working<br> for you on this ranch,<br> and, Daddy,<br> you've had top-grade cheap labour.<br> I've shovelled manure for you.<br> You've got my calluses. For what?<br> Your blessings the day you die?<br> No, damn it.<br> I want out of this spread<br> what I put into it.<br> Have you got a proposal, Hud?<br> Get on the phone and sell every cow you<br> own. They ain't got a chain on you yet.<br> That's how you'd get out of a tight?<br> I can ship the whole herd out<br> before they begin the test.<br> Try and pass bad stuff off on my<br> neighbours who wouldn't know?<br> You don't know it's bad stuff.<br> I'll ship 'em up north<br> before the news gets out.<br> And take a chance on starting<br> an epidemic in the entire country?<br> This whole country is run on epidemics.<br> Where've you been?<br> Epidemics of big business price fixing,<br> crooked TV shows,<br> income-tax finagling,<br> souped-up expense accounts.<br> How many honest men you know?<br> Take the sinners from the saints,<br> you're lucky to get Lincoln.<br> I say let's put our bread into<br> some of that gravy while it is still hot.<br> You're an unprincipled man, Hud.<br> Don't let that fuss you.<br> You've got enough for both of us.<br> This afternoon's been a regular bitch.<br> - You out of poop?<br> - Just having a breather.<br> Go back to the ranch and grab a nap.<br> No, I'll hold up my end of it.<br> Yeah, I guess you would.<br> Granddad.<br> I found your longhorns near Idiot Ridge.<br> Government's gonna have a hard time<br> trying to inspect 'em.<br> Those big horns'll<br> never go through a chute.<br> There ain't many left, are there?<br> No, they're dying out.<br> I just keep 'em for old times' sake,<br> to remind me of how things was.<br> Everything we had come from their<br> hides: Our furniture, our ropes,<br> our clothes, our hats.<br> Granddad, let's turn 'em loose.<br> No, Lon, that wouldn't be the thing to do.<br> They gotta go with the rest.<br> - Granddad.<br> - Oh, why, thank you, Lon.<br> I shouldn't have brought you here<br> after the day you put in.<br> If the picture's any good,<br> I'll wake up, don't you worry.<br> Looks like you're the only one who ain't<br> got someone's knee to pinch.<br> Oh, I think I can stand it.<br> You wouldn't think they'd pay 65 cents<br> to come here and do it.<br> They can go up in the hayloft<br> for nothing.<br> Come on, you miners, '49ers,<br> let's all join in and sing that old favourite,<br> Clementine.<br> Just follow the bouncing ball.<br> You gonna get your mouth around that?<br> Gonna try.<br> - Hi, Hud.<br> - How are you?<br> - Is that Truman Peters' wife with Hud?<br> - I think so.<br> - Want me to call him over?<br> - No, just leave him.<br> Got a half a buck?<br> Hey, come on back.<br> You gonna give me the change?<br> Hey, hey,<br> let's make a party out of this.<br> This not-too-natural blonde<br> here is Mrs Truman Peters.<br> - How do you do?<br> - How do you do?<br> Wild Horse Homer Bannon<br> as he used to be known.<br> And this gangly youth over there<br> is my nephew, Lon.<br> You may have just noticed,<br> my daddy hasn't asked us to sit down.<br> He doesn't want to socialise with me.<br> He's fussy about<br> the company he keeps.<br> You're a married woman, Lily.<br> That doesn't go down well with him.<br> He's a man of high principles.<br> Doesn't believe in any loose living at all.<br> Isn't that right?<br> - Granddad.<br> - Homer, you OK?<br> Get me... Get me home, boy.<br> Roll down that window a little, will you?<br> That's good. Place back there<br> seemed a little short of air.<br> Maybe you just got too much sun today.<br> Well, whatever.<br> No need to pull such a long face about it.<br> I feel better now.<br> When we get home,<br> I'm going to fix you some Sal Hepatica.<br> Yeah, that'll settle me right down.<br> He dropped right off.<br> He's beginning to look kind of worn out,<br> isn't he?<br> Sometimes I forget how old he is.<br> - Guess I just don't want to think about it.<br> - It's time you started.<br> I know he's gonna die some day.<br> I know that much.<br> He is.<br> Makes me feel like somebody dumped<br> me into a cold river.<br> Happens to everybody:<br> Horses, dogs, men.<br> Nobody gets out of life alive.<br> - I'll give you a hand upstairs.<br> - Lon'll take care of me.<br> Suit yourself.<br> Goodnight, Hud.<br> Thanks for the game, boys. You can<br> have another shot at me next pay-day.<br> - Got a cigarette?<br> - Yeah.<br> Don't keep me on the porch<br> like I'm selling something.<br> All right, come on in.<br> - They're a little squashed.<br> - It's all right. They'll do.<br> - I see you got things fixed up some.<br> - I try.<br> Looks pretty good,<br> except your sweet potato's got the blight.<br> I can't seem to get one started.<br> They need love and care like all of us.<br> I'll keep it in mind.<br> Could I have a match?<br> Well, what have we got here?<br> "Jiffy Portable Hairdryer."<br> "Triple screen."<br> Automatic toaster.<br> You been rustlin'?<br> I go in for those prize contests.<br> "How Shinette Shampoo<br> changed my life," in 20 words.<br> They give free trips to Europe.<br> I end up with the fountain pens<br> and the binoculars.<br> Won me a turkey raffle once,<br> but it was fixed.<br> I got friendly with one of them girls<br> picking the numbers.<br> It figures.<br> How much you<br> take the boys for tonight?<br> Twenty dollars and some change.<br> - You're a dangerous woman.<br> - I'm a good poker player.<br> You're a good housekeeper.<br> You're a good cook.<br> You're a good laundress.<br> - What else are you good at?<br> - At taking care of myself.<br> Shouldn't have to,<br> a woman looks like you.<br> That's what my ex-husband<br> used to tell me,<br> before he took my wallet,<br> my gasoline credit card<br> and left me stranded<br> in a motel in Albuquerque.<br> What did you do to make him take to<br> the hills? Wear your curlers to bed?<br> Ed's a gambler.<br> He's probably up at Vegas or Reno,<br> dealing at night,<br> losing it all back in the daytime.<br> Man like that sounds<br> no better than a heel.<br> Aren't you all?<br> Don't go shooting all the dogs<br> 'cause one's got fleas.<br> I was married to Ed for six years.<br> Only thing he was ever good for<br> was scratching my back.<br> - Still got that itch?<br> - Off and on.<br> Let me know when it's bothering you.<br> We're injecting these cows and horses<br> with specimens taken from your herd.<br> In three to six days, we should<br> know what we want to know.<br> Move on in there! Get in that chute!<br> You all right, Lon?<br> She kicked you into the fence.<br> You skint your head a little.<br> Boy, you caught a lick.<br> Back to work.<br> Boys'll be on you for a week, if you quit.<br> No need to rush him. You all right, Lon?<br> - You've had it, Fantan.<br> - Get him to bed.<br> All right, Jack, back to work.<br> All this time I thought you was skinny.<br> You weigh a ton.<br> I can't seem to get my head on straight.<br> - I think I'm gonna lose my breakfast.<br> - Not over me. Hold your fire!<br> - Sugar! You're white as a sheet.<br> - Sure, you're getting flour all over me.<br> - What happened?<br> - A cow cuddled up to him.<br> - Shouldn't a doctor look at him?<br> - Pay five bucks for aspirin? He'll mend.<br> That's it. I draw the line at bedpans.<br> Thanks, Hud.<br> Gold-brick for the rest of the day,<br> just don't stretch it into two.<br> Here, let's get those boots off.<br> Cold lemonade.<br> Here. Oh, come on,<br> they're only lemon seeds.<br> That better?<br> You ought to doze off now.<br> Gee, Alma, you're cool.<br> You smell of lemon.<br> - Alma?<br> - What is it, sugar?<br> - You're really beautiful.<br> - Oh, sure I am.<br> You're one of the best people<br> there ever was. You're good to me.<br> - In fact, you're good, period.<br> - You be good, too. Get some sleep.<br> Morning, Granddad.<br> - How are you today, Lonnie?<br> - Good. Real good.<br> Have I been sawing wood up there!<br> I slept round the clock.<br> I feel almost like working.<br> What have you got for me?<br> Patch a little fence?<br> Pull up some weeds?<br> Work a few calves?<br> I don't guess we'll do anything much.<br> No point wasting work<br> until I find out about my cattle.<br> We'll just roll over and play dead<br> and let 'em shovel dirt in our faces.<br> If my cattle don't get a clean bill<br> of health, we are just about dead.<br> Dead broke.<br> We've bred this beef all our<br> lives to get the best stock in the country.<br> The government will end up paying<br> four bits on the dollar.<br> - Poor but honest. That's us.<br> - We ain't sure. We'll just have to wait.<br> Don't get sores on your butt doing it.<br> I could do without that noise, Lon.<br> Go stretch your legs a little, will you?<br> Where's that bottle? I had a bottle<br> of Jack Daniel's in that cupboard.<br> - You drank it.<br> - When?<br> Instead of dinner, Wednesday night.<br> Don't remember.<br> If you think I drunk it,<br> I only drink Tokay wine.<br> And I bet you keep your little finger<br> crooked while you're doing it.<br> Go stick your head in the water<br> trough and sober up for lunch.<br> Don't you find me in control of myself?<br> - I'd hate to see you walk a straight line.<br> - That's easy.<br> I don't like sudden passes.<br> We'll ease into it, then. There's another<br> one coming up on your right.<br> Don't you ever ask?<br> Only question I ever ask is, "What time's<br> your husband coming home?"<br> What's keeping you?<br> You're over the age of consent.<br> - Way over.<br> - Let's untie our shoelaces.<br> I've been asked<br> with a little more finesse in my time.<br> Yeah.<br> I wouldn't want to come on crude.<br> No, ma'am.<br> I'll bring you a 2lb box of candy,<br> maybe some perfume.<br> How about some coloured beads<br> and wampum?<br> - Whatever it takes to make you trade.<br> - No, thanks.<br> I've done my time with one cold-blooded<br> bastard. I'm not looking for another.<br> It's too late. You already found him.<br> You hardly touched your plate.<br> Nothing to do with your cooking.<br> I just ain't hungry.<br> - Anything from the vets?<br> - No, they're taking their time.<br> I ain't gonna sit around here and stew.<br> The Kiwanis are waiting.<br> - Gonna be at that pig scramble?<br> - Yeah.<br> See if I can make the Bannons<br> look good for a change.<br> You honchos want to come,<br> there's room in the cheering section.<br> They're letting ladies in free tonight.<br> You just might qualify.<br> That's the first time Hud asked me to go<br> any place. I wonder why he did.<br> Lonesome, I imagine.<br> Trying to scare up a little company.<br> Lonesome?<br> He can get more women than anybody.<br> That ain't necessarily much and<br> it ain't necessarily company.<br> Women just like to be around<br> something dangerous part of the time.<br> Even Hud can get lonesome<br> once in a while.<br> Well, I wouldn't mind watching him<br> chase those squealers.<br> - Then we'll go on in.<br> - I'll stay home. I don't like pigs.<br> Let's give these kids a hand.<br> Applaud for the kid you liked the best.<br> That's it, ladies and gentlemen,<br> looks like number ten won it.<br> You've seen one kind of twisting,<br> you're about to see another.<br> We've got ten men<br> gonna tie themselves in knots<br> trying to catch the fastest pigs<br> you've ever seen.<br> The first to catch his pig<br> and bring it here is the winner.<br> If you boys will come on in,<br> we'll get this started. Come on.<br> - You got the pigs ready?<br> - You bet.<br> Come on, let's go then.<br> You're outside there.<br> Wag, pull your hat off. Let's go.<br> When I say three we'll go.<br> One, two, three, go!<br> It looks like we got a winner,<br> Hud Bannon.<br> Hud, that pig looks<br> about as dirty as you do.<br> Towel?<br> Thank you for turning out.<br> We hope you enjoyed yourselves.<br> We look forward to seeing you<br> next year at the contest.<br> Wish I could still get around<br> the way you do.<br> You sure churn up that dust.<br> I want to kick up more before<br> the night's over. Anybody interested?<br> That's enough excitement for me,<br> I guess.<br> I'll be getting back. Lon?<br> It's still kinda early.<br> I might stick around with Hud for a while.<br> I'll leave the door open for you.<br> Hitch up your pants. I'll get cleaned up,<br> then I'll buy you a drink.<br> - Want to put a little kick in that?<br> - Sure. OK.<br> Come on, I can handle it.<br> Whoa! Whoa!<br> - Pretty girl.<br> - Don't let me cramp you.<br> - I wouldn't make any move at her.<br> - Why not? You ain't nailed down.<br> - That's a woman and a half.<br> - You're a pretty good-looking kid.<br> Damp down that cowlick<br> and button your collar,<br> you might just make out.<br> I wouldn't mind driving her<br> the long way home.<br> Yeah, you ought to take a crack at that.<br> Get all the good you can out of 17,<br> 'cause it sure wears out in a hurry.<br> Trouble is, I've got to like a girl a lot<br> before I can work up to anything.<br> - I mean like her as a person.<br> - You're a regular idealist.<br> - What's wrong with that?<br> - I don't know. I ain't never tried it.<br> - I suppose you think I'm a jerk.<br> - What do you care what I think?<br> This is probably gonna hand you<br> a big laugh... but I do.<br> You have another little drink.<br> And I'll have another little drink.<br> Then maybe we can work up<br> some real family feeling here.<br> Well, I think I'll shove some change<br> in that juke.<br> - Hi.<br> - What are you gawking at?<br> - I ain't gawking.<br> - I don't like fresh kids.<br> - Nobody's getting fresh.<br> - I'll take you out and loosen your teeth.<br> Are you having words<br> with this youngster?<br> - I'm about to put him into the hospital.<br> - Is that so?<br> - Has he been bothering you?<br> - He ain't bothering me.<br> It's her he's bothering.<br> You didn't offer him any<br> encouragement, young lady?<br> - No.<br> - That's funny.<br> I was sitting there<br> and I got a little encouraged.<br> - Maybe it's the way you move.<br> - All right, I'll take you instead.<br> I don't want to be hoggish.<br> Lon, you want a piece?<br> That's one hell of a night!<br> I could do that about six times a week.<br> - You don't win them all, you know?<br> - I would if you were backing me.<br> That would make quite a combination.<br> Nobody'd ever mess with the Bannons.<br> Felt like old times there for a while.<br> - Your daddy and I used to take them on.<br> - He must've been a good old boy.<br> What, Norman? Yeah.<br> He used to leave his loose change out<br> when I was a kid so I could swipe some.<br> Let me take a girl from him once in a<br> while like I'd done it on my own.<br> He was bigger than you<br> and had a bigger wallet, but I tell you,<br> when you ain't being a pain,<br> you remind me of him.<br> - I do?<br> - Yeah.<br> Then how come<br> we don't hit it off so good?<br> I got short arms.<br> Never been anybody like old Norman.<br> Never will be.<br> He was one way-out boy.<br> Claimed he could hear the grass grow.<br> He got me to go to his pasture<br> one night to listen.<br> After three or four hours nipping away at<br> that bottle to keep the dew off,<br> I swore I could hear it, too.<br> That's the night I racked up the car.<br> Piled up on Samson Creek Bridge.<br> He died in half an hour.<br> I didn't even have a mark on me.<br> I wonder if your daddy's hearing the<br> grass now, growing up over his grave.<br> That story ought to cool you off some.<br> It doesn't.<br> Fantan, either you're soft-hearted<br> or soft-headed. I don't know which.<br> Hey, Granddad.<br> He's got you drunk.<br> What else has he given you a taste for?<br> - All we had was a couple of drinks.<br> - Don't remember you being a teetotaller.<br> I drink. I don't object<br> to his having whiskey.<br> - Something's eating away at your liver.<br> - You, Hud. Like always.<br> - What are you climbing on Hud for?<br> - You think a lot of Hud?<br> You think he's a real man?<br> You're being took in.<br> Listen to him. He's my daddy, he knows.<br> I know you. You're smart.<br> You got your share of guts.<br> You can talk a man into trusting you,<br> a woman into wanting you.<br> - I got it made!<br> - To hear you tell it.<br> Get it off your chest! What's been griping<br> you is what I done to Norman.<br> You were drunk<br> and careless of your brother.<br> You had 15 years to get over it.<br> That's never been our quarrel.<br> - The hell it isn't.<br> - No. I was sick of you long before that.<br> Well, isn't life full of surprises?<br> And all along I thought it was<br> 'cause of what I done to my brother.<br> I took that hard, but I buried it.<br> All right, what turned you sour on me?<br> Not that I give a damn.<br> Just that, Hud. You don't give a damn.<br> That's all. That's the whole of it.<br> You still don't get it, do you?<br> You don't care about people.<br> You don't give a damn about 'em.<br> You got all that charm and it makes<br> the youngsters want to be like you.<br> That's the shame of it<br> 'cause you don't value nothing.<br> You don't respect nothing.<br> You keep no check on your appetites.<br> You live just for yourself<br> and that makes you not fit to live with.<br> My mama loved me, but she died.<br> Why pick on Hud, Granddad?<br> He ain't the only one. Just about<br> everybody around here is like him.<br> That's no cause for rejoicing, is it?<br> Little by little, the look of the country<br> changes because of the men we admire.<br> - I still think you nailed him pretty hard.<br> - Did I?<br> Maybe. Old people get<br> as hard as their arteries sometimes.<br> You're just gonna have to<br> make up your own mind one day<br> about what's right and what's wrong.<br> Where's that cotton-picking housekeeper<br> of ours? I want something to eat.<br> - It's late. She's asleep.<br> - Ain't that just keen.<br> Paying her good money to sleep<br> when I'm starving to death.<br> - I could fry you up an egg sandwich.<br> - Forget it.<br> Get out of here.<br> I can't think with you standing around.<br> I'm gonna knock some people<br> on their tails. You might be one of 'em.<br> Go on, get out of here!<br> - Boy, they mean trouble.<br> - I wish I'd stayed out of bull riding.<br> From the look of them,<br> you ain't riding very far.<br> Thanks, buddy.<br> I'd better go check my gear.<br> Never mind your gear, check your head.<br> That bull's gonna eat you up.<br> - How are you, Hotrod?<br> - Hi, Hud.<br> Get a good seat for the show?<br> They're getting two bucks<br> for those bleachers over there.<br> Be my guest.<br> - This is ten dollars, Hud.<br> - It's good. I didn't print it.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Stick with me.<br> Your jeans'll be full of change.<br> How come?<br> Well, I'll tell you.<br> Put on a clean white shirt<br> and saw a lawyer.<br> There's a law that says when old<br> folks can't cut the mustard any more,<br> you can make 'em let go,<br> whether they like it or not.<br> What are you pulling on Granddad now?<br> Something pretty raw, kid.<br> Yeah, it sounds like it.<br> Take your dough. I don't want it.<br> Don't look down your nose at me.<br> I'm gonna get old, too.<br> I don't aim to end up on county relief with<br> a bowl of soup and two cigarettes a day,<br> if I behave myself.<br> I want what I worked for.<br> I got a right to it.<br> You know something, Honcho?<br> You don't look out for yourself,<br> the only helping hand you'll ever get<br> is when they lower the box.<br> Now, you have fun, you hear?<br> - Hud?<br> - You're up awful late.<br> - I got a lot on my mind.<br> - Come on in. Take a load off your feet.<br> - Talk to the vet today?<br> - Yes, but I didn't get a lot of information.<br> Did you expect to?<br> Government man wants you to know<br> something, he'll call.<br> They're watching<br> the test animals pretty close,<br> but nothing's showed up yet.<br> - Hud.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> What's this tricky deal you're up to?<br> Lon tells me you're gonna<br> pull the rug out from under me.<br> That's right.<br> I ain't got all the rough edges<br> ironed out yet,<br> but I can give you an idea.<br> The main thing is you, old man.<br> You're too old to make the grade.<br> Whether they liquidate us<br> or not when this thing is over,<br> you just better get out of my way.<br> What in hell do you mean?<br> When an old man buys a bunch of sick<br> Mexican cows it means he's over the hill.<br> You've got the incompetence, Daddy,<br> and Hotrod's too young<br> to take things over.<br> So I get the court to appoint me guardian<br> of your property. I don't know.<br> If I don't get it one way, I'll get it another.<br> Why, you're badly mistaken<br> about all this.<br> I'll be the only one to run this ranch<br> while I'm alive.<br> After that, you may get part of it.<br> I don't know. But you can't get control<br> of this place. No way in the world.<br> Don't go making any bets on that.<br> Maybe I treated you too hard.<br> I made some mistakes.<br> A man don't always do what's right.<br> Daddy, you ain't never been wrong.<br> You been handing<br> out the ten tablets of law<br> from whatever hill you could find<br> since I was a kid.<br> Shape up or ship out. That's the way<br> you run things around here.<br> Wild-eyed Homer Bannon,<br> passing out scripture and verse<br> like you wrote it yourself.<br> So, I just naturally had to go bad,<br> in the face of so much good.<br> Hud, how'd a man like you<br> come to be a son to me?<br> Oh, that's easy.<br> I wasn't on your doorstep.<br> I wasn't found in no bulrushes.<br> You got the same feelings<br> below your belt as any other man.<br> That's how you got stuck<br> with me for a son, like it or not.<br> He was just so drunk, Alma.<br> Did he hurt you?<br> Should I take you to town,<br> get you a doctor?<br> Go on out of here.<br> - What are you looking at?<br> - I'm looking at you, Hud.<br> Climb off it. You've been<br> wanting to do the same thing.<br> Always been wanting to wallow her.<br> Yeah, I've been wanting to do it.<br> But not mean like you.<br> Here comes Mr Burris.<br> - Morning.<br> - Morning.<br> - You've missed breakfast.<br> - Thanks, but I've eaten.<br> I guess you've got something to tell us<br> or you wouldn't be here.<br> - I guess the tests are done.<br> - Yes, sir, they're done.<br> You got the worst thing you could have.<br> - And there's no cure at all?<br> - Not that we know of.<br> Like lightning. Don't hurt you till it hits.<br> Your cows are public enemies now. We<br> got to handle this fast before it spreads.<br> What do I do? Drive them into<br> a pit and shoot 'em? I can't abide that.<br> - It's terrible, even to think about.<br> - I've seen it during the Depression.<br> It's a sight worse to see<br> than to think about.<br> You're getting older.<br> You can afford to slow down.<br> The rest won't hurt your grass any.<br> You might even sell a few oil leases.<br> My daddy thinks oil is something<br> you stick in your salad dressing.<br> If there's oil down there, you can get it<br> sucked up after I'm under there with it.<br> But I don't like it.<br> There'll be no holes<br> punched in this land while I'm here.<br> They ain't gonna come in and grade no<br> roads so the wind can blow me away.<br> What's oil to me?<br> What can I do<br> with a bunch of oil wells?<br> I can't ride out every day and prowl<br> amongst 'em like I can my cattle.<br> I can't breed 'em or tend 'em<br> or rope 'em or chase 'em or nothing.<br> I can't feel a smidgen of pride in 'em<br> 'cause they ain't none of my doing.<br> There's money in it.<br> I don't want that kind of money.<br> I want mine to come from something<br> that keeps a man doing for himself.<br> We're much obliged to you<br> for coming out in person to tell us.<br> Start shooting.<br> It didn't take long.<br> It don't take long to kill things.<br> Not like it does to grow.<br> There's a couple we missed. I'll get 'em.<br> Where do you think you're going?<br> Finish this job. Somebody needs to.<br> Well, you just close that gate.<br> I'll kill them two myself,<br> seeing as how I raised 'em.<br> Something wrong with you, mister?<br> - There's no guarantee you'll do it.<br> - He just said he would.<br> You get in the car.<br> We'll finish burying those carcasses,<br> then we're leaving.<br> Mr Bannon can handle the rest of this<br> without us bothering him.<br> You just get along, Mr Burris.<br> I know none of this ain't your doing.<br> You see about the burying and<br> then get that fella off my ranch.<br> All I can say is, I'm sorry.<br> I'm sure sorry.<br> He ain't such a bad fella.<br> Just got a cruddy job.<br> Boys, I don't plan to have any work<br> around here for some time.<br> I can't afford to keep you on<br> till things get better so...<br> ...l'll just have to let you go.<br> Give me the rifle.<br> Lord, but I have chased<br> them longhorns many a mile.<br> I don't know if I can kill 'em.<br> But I guess I can.<br> I guess this is the worst thing<br> that ever happened to you.<br> Oh, I'll get over it.<br> If my health don't go to failing me.<br> Lon, you go away someplace.<br> Well, them old bulls are hard to kill.<br> Drag 'em away and bury 'em.<br> Bury 'em quick. Go on.<br> Did you call about the bus for me?<br> - Yeah, it leaves at 10.26.<br> - Can I buy my ticket on it?<br> Yeah, they said that would be OK.<br> - I got $200 calf money, if you're short.<br> - You just keep it.<br> Well, I'm ready.<br> I wish you weren't going off<br> and leaving us, Alma.<br> Look after your grandpa. He's getting<br> old and feeble. He's your job now.<br> We need you around here. I sure do.<br> You'll get along just fine.<br> I wish you'd stay.<br> I've been all over this country, looking for<br> the exact right place and right people,<br> so once I got stopped,<br> I wouldn't have to be moving again.<br> And it just hasn't worked out.<br> Goodbye, honey.<br> You take care of yourself.<br> And don't you be lazy now.<br> How are you, Pee Wee?<br> Looks like we're losing a good cook.<br> Maybe we should've<br> boosted your salary a little.<br> You ain't letting that little ruckus we<br> had run you off, are you?<br> As far as I can get on a bus ticket.<br> Are you claiming I'm the first guy<br> ever stuck his foot in your door?<br> - No.<br> - I'm the first that ever got rough, huh?<br> Well, I'm sorry. That ain't my style.<br> I don't usually get rough with my women.<br> Generally don't have to.<br> - You're rough on everybody.<br> - So they tell me.<br> You know, it would've happened<br> eventually without the rough house.<br> You look pretty good<br> without your shirt on.<br> Sight of that through the window<br> often made me put down my dishtowel.<br> Why didn't you speak up sooner?<br> I'll remember you, honey.<br> You're the one that got away.<br> Come on, boy, get!<br> Knucklehead, why d'you hit the brakes?<br> You got your life's work<br> paying for this car.<br> Granddad's out here.<br> He's crawling in the road.<br> Granddad, what happened?<br> Are you hurt?<br> I wanted to take a look around the place.<br> I fell off my horse.<br> - He's hurt pretty bad.<br> - Let me up.<br> - Come on.<br> - A man ain't to crawl.<br> Take my car to the ranch. Call an<br> ambulance. Tell them to get here quick.<br> Tell them we got an awful sick man here.<br> Let me up.<br> It won't start.<br> All right, forget it. Forget it.<br> There's a bottle of whiskey in the dash.<br> Bring it over.<br> Easy, easy, old man.<br> Don't make me drink that stuff.<br> Go to the main road, flag a car down.<br> Get some help up here. Move!<br> - Don't send him away, Hud.<br> - I'm right here, Granddad. Don't worry.<br> I feel kinda cold.<br> Everything's gonna be all right.<br> - I don't know if I want it to be.<br> - Don't say that. You'll be just fine.<br> I feel like throwing in the sponge.<br> Like givin' up.<br> You've never quit on anything<br> in your whole life.<br> Hud there's waiting on me.<br> And he ain't a patient man.<br> He isn't gone, is he?<br> Yeah.<br> I meant to buy him a brand-new<br> blanket-lined jacket.<br> And give it to him some time or other.<br> Lonnie. Hey.<br> It was the best thing.<br> He was wore out and he knew it.<br> He didn't seem so bad.<br> He didn't seem so bad off at all.<br> Well, he was. Trying to get up.<br> Hurting himself.<br> He couldn't have made it.<br> Anyway,<br> he couldn't have made it another hour.<br> He could if he'd wanted to. You fixed<br> it so he didn't want to any more.<br> You don't know the whole story.<br> Yeah, him and me fought many<br> and many a round together.<br> But I guess you could say I helped him<br> about as much as he ever helped me.<br> How did you help him, Hud?<br> By trying to sell him out?<br> By taking the heart out of him?<br> By making him give up and quit?<br> Is that how you helped him?<br> He ain't in any loaf-around eternal life.<br> He's the way he always was.<br> Enjoying his good horses.<br> Looking after the land.<br> Trying to figure out ways<br> to beat the dry weather and wind.<br> Settle down. You've still<br> got the graveyard in front of you.<br> I know what you're feeling, but look at it<br> this way. He's gone to a better place.<br> I don't think so.<br> Not unless dirt is a better place than air.<br> Well, we took him to the graveyard<br> and put him down.<br> It's all over with now.<br> - What have you got there?<br> - My gear.<br> Going someplace?<br> Yeah.<br> Travelling kinda light, ain't ya?<br> Got everything I need.<br> Planning to go for good?<br> That's right.<br> What about your half of the spread here?<br> Put my share in the bank. I'm going<br> somewhere else to work for a while.<br> If I can happen on to a job.<br> Ain't you a little bit green<br> to go cutting loose on your own?<br> Well, we'll see.<br> I was about your age<br> when I went in the army.<br> Your granddaddy bought me a Mars<br> candy bar at the station, and said,<br> "Character's the only thing<br> I got to give you. Be a man."<br> Well, I guess he was kinda worried.<br> Your trying so hard to get out of the draft.<br> Honcho!<br> I just wanted you to know that<br> if you don't make your million, you can<br> always come back and work for me.<br> I won't be back this way.<br> I guess you've come to be of your<br> granddaddy's opinion<br> that I ain't fit to live with.<br> That's too bad.<br> We might've whooped it up some.<br> That's the way<br> you used to want it.<br> I used to. So long, Hud.<br> Fantan, this world is so full of crap,<br> a man's gonna get into it sooner or later,<br> whether he's careful or not.<br>
