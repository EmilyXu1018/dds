                        - Good morning.<br> - Good morning, madame.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Hello.<br> New delivery. I'm sure you've<br> got some excellent books there.<br> Got you at last!<br> Not the first time you've stolen<br> from me, is it, my little thief?!<br> - Hm? Quick, empty your pockets.<br> - You're hurting me!<br> Empty your pockets,<br> or I'll call the Station Inspector.<br> Do as I say!<br> Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.<br> What are you doing with all these?<br> - And the other one.<br> - There's nothing in it.<br> Where's the Station Inspector?!<br> Ghosts.<br> Did you draw these pictures?<br> Did you draw these pictures?<br> Where did you steal this?<br> - I didn't steal it.<br> - You're a thief and a liar.<br> - Get out of here.<br> - Give me my notebook!<br> It's no longer your notebook!<br> It is my notebook and I'll do with it<br> what I like! Maybe I'll just burn it!<br> - No!<br> - Then tell me who did the drawings!<br> Get out of here, you little thief!<br> Why are you still here?<br> - Go!<br> - Maximilian, do you hear an atrocity'?<br> Calamity? Corruption? Go!<br> Excuse me, excuse me!<br> Move aside!<br> Move aside! Gangway!<br> Move, move!<br> Stand aside!<br> What?!<br> - Ah! A wolf!<br> Move, move! Ah!<br> As you were.<br> Move!<br> Stop that child! Apprehend!<br> Monsieur Frick!<br> Hey! Move aside!<br> Whoa!<br> - Move!<br> - Whoa!<br> - Move!<br> - Pardon me!<br> - Sir, move!<br> Malediction!<br> Oh! No! Stop the train!<br> Hold the train! Whoa!<br> Help! Help! Assistance!<br> Oh! Hold it, hold the train!<br> Move the bag! Move the bag!<br> Ohhh! Oh! No!<br> - Oh, my God! I'm so sorry<br> I'm so sorry.<br> No, no, no.<br> That was very, very bad.<br> I know you're there.<br> What's your name, boy'?<br> Hugo. Hugo Cabret.<br> Stay away from me, Hugo Cabret.<br> Or I'll drag you<br> to the Station Inspector's office.<br> He'll lock you up in his little cell,<br> and you'll never get out,<br> you'll never go to school,<br> you will never get married<br> and have children of your own<br> to take things<br> that don't belong to them.<br> Give me back my notebook.<br> I'm going home to burn your notebook.<br> - You can't burn my notebook.<br> - And who's to stop me'?<br> Oh, you look so cold.<br> I'm very hot.<br> He's really upset me.<br> - Who's really upset you?<br> - That child.<br> Who are you?<br> Your grandfather stole my notebook.<br> I've got to get it back<br> before he burns it.<br> Papa Georges isn't my grandfather.<br> And he isn't a thief.<br> You're the thief.<br> You're nothing but a...<br> a reprobate.<br> - You'll have to go.<br> - Not without my notebook.<br> Why do you need it so badly'?<br> I can't tell you.<br> Is it a secret?<br> - Yes.<br> - Oh, good, I love secrets.<br> - Tell me this instant.<br> - No.<br> Well, if you won't tell me,<br> then you'll have to leave.<br> - Not without my notebook!<br> - Shh!<br> I'll get in trouble.<br> Just go home.<br> All right.<br> I'll make sure he doesn't<br> burn your notebook.<br> Now go.<br> What is it?<br> It's called an automaton.<br> An aut... An automaton?<br> I found him abandoned<br> in the attic at the museum.<br> What does he do?<br> He's a windup figure,<br> like a music box.<br> This is the most complicated one<br> I've ever seen... by far.<br> You see, this one...<br> this one can write.<br> It must've been made in London.<br> Where Mother was from.<br> She was from Coventry, but she...<br> moved to London.<br> Magicians used machines like this<br> when I was a boy.<br> Some walked, some danced,<br> some sang.<br> But the secret was always<br> in the clockwork.<br> Huh, look at that.<br> Can we fix him?<br> Oh, I don't know, Hugo.<br> He's badly rusted.<br> And finding parts to fit<br> will be very hard.<br> Of course we can fix him.<br> We're clockmakers, aren't we?<br> But only after I've finished<br> my work at the shop<br> and at the museum, hmm?<br> You understand.<br> We'll put this back in.<br> Just steady it...<br> Perfect.<br> You see this?<br> Another complication.<br> Another mystery.<br> That makes you happy.<br> Mmm. A keyhole<br> in the shape of a heart.<br> Unfortunately, we don't have the key.<br> I fixed the gears and...<br> Uncle Claude.<br> There was a fire.<br> Your father's dead.<br> Pack your things, quickly.<br> You're coming with me.<br> - Quick!<br> You'll be my apprentice,<br> and you'll live with me at the station.<br> And I'll teach you how<br> to take care of them clocks.<br> These apartments were built for them<br> that run the station years ago.<br> But every body's forgotten they're here.<br> Your bed is in the corner, over there.<br> Now get some sleep.<br> We start work at 5:00.<br> Oh...<br> - What about school?<br> - You've finished with school!<br> There'll be no time for that<br> when you're in them walls.<br> Hugo, without me,<br> you'd be in the orphanage.<br> Ah, time...<br> - My time is... 60 seconds in a minute.<br> Sixty minutes in an hour.<br> Time is everything.<br> Everything.<br> Ah,<br> time, time, time...<br> OK.<br> Oh, hello.<br> - I just thought...<br> - ...rather nice joke.<br> - Ah, ah, ah!<br> Oh, oh!<br> Stop that!<br> No, Schatzi! Stop it!<br> - Oh!<br> - No, no, no, no!<br> Come back!<br> Stand back!<br> He's just a small little dog.<br> Please be careful!<br> You've stepped on him!<br> Don't hurt him!<br> - Good morning!<br> - Morning, sweetheart.<br> Hello, how are you?<br> Good morning, sir.<br> Can I help you with anything?<br> I'll take these.<br> I thought I might see you today.<br> I need my notebook.<br> Why do you need it so badly'?<br> To help me...<br> to fix something.<br> Go away.<br> Please just go away.<br> Wait! Hey!<br> - Sorry, I...<br> - I saw.<br> - Are you crying?<br> - No.<br> Hold still.<br> Look, there's nothing wrong with crying.<br> Sydney Carton cries.<br> And Heathcliff, too.<br> - In books, they're crying all the time.<br> - I can do it.<br> I need to talk to you.<br> It's terribly important, but...<br> But not here. We're too...<br> exposed.<br> - Come on.<br> - Where are we going?<br> Only to the most wonderful<br> place on earth.<br> It's Neverland and Oz and...<br> Treasure Island all wrapped into one.<br> - Good morning, Monsieur Labisse.<br> Ah, Isabelle.<br> May I present to you<br> Monsieur Hugo Cabret,<br> a very old and dear companion.<br> Monsieur Cabret.<br> Hello.<br> Well, thank you for this.<br> I think I'm halfway in love with<br> David Copperfield. Photography'?<br> - Back corner, left, top shelf.<br> - Thank you.<br> Listen, what's so important?<br> Papa Georges still has your notebook.<br> He didn't burn it.<br> That was all a trick.<br> - Why?<br> I don't know.<br> All I know is the notebook<br> made him very upset.<br> And he and Mama Jeanne stayed up<br> very late talking about it.<br> Well, you see, I think he was crying.<br> Why are you helping me?<br> Because this might be an adventure.<br> And I've never had one before...<br> outside of books, at least.<br> And I think we should be very...<br> clandestine.<br> OK.<br> By the way, my name's Isabelle.<br> Do you want a book?<br> Monsieur Labisse lets me borrow them,<br> and I'm sure I could get one for you.<br> No.<br> Don't you like books?<br> No... No, I do.<br> My father and I used to read<br> Jules Verne together.<br> Well, come on.<br> How do I get my notebook back?<br> Well, I think you<br> should stand up to him.<br> And don't tell him we talked.<br> I'll help you if I can.<br> Be steadfast.<br> Go away.<br> Fix it.<br> I said, fix it.<br> I know you've been<br> stealing parts from the shop.<br> You might as well use those<br> you haven't stolen yet.<br> Give me my notebook.<br> You've got a bit of talent.<br> But you'll have to prove there's<br> more to you than being a thief.<br> - You can earn your notebook.<br> - How?<br> Come to the booth every day.<br> I'll decide how long you must<br> work for each item you stole.<br> And it will be up to me<br> to decide when...<br> you've earned<br> your notebook, if ever.<br> - I already have a job.<br> - "Thief" is not a job, boy.<br> I have a different job.<br> But I'll come when I can.<br> You begin tomorrow. Go away.<br> I'll begin now.<br> Not that one, the other one.<br> Is this your card?<br> Where is it?<br> - Little man.<br> - Ah!<br> Where are your designated adults?<br> Answer me!<br> - Ain't got none.<br> - Do you have any parents?<br> - No!<br> - Excellent.<br> It's straight to the orphanage<br> with you, isn't it?<br> What were you doing<br> looking in that man's bottle?<br> Was that your...<br> Was that your bottle?!<br> as that your paper bag?<br> Was that your paper bag?<br> It states clearly...<br> Yes, Gustave Dast<br> here. Yes, Officer, another orphan.<br> Um, trespass and theft this time.<br> His hand was trespassing<br> inside a paper bag, with the intent<br> - of removing its contents.<br> The object of his plunder? A pastry.<br> Be quiet!<br> Keep... Stop your sniffling,<br> you little urchin,<br> - with your filthy little mitts.<br> No, of course I wasn't talking to you.<br> I have only the highest respect for you.<br> Please.<br> No, that was not a comment<br> about your wife.<br> - That's absurd.<br> I have not heard any of those rumors.<br> No, I was not aware of that.<br> Well, I'm sure she will return.<br> - Come on, you little vermin.<br> So here's the little<br> pastry thief, eh?<br> - This is the one.<br> - Who's a little strudel thief then?<br> Apologies about your wife.<br> What do you think I should do about her?<br> - What? About what?<br> - Leaving me.<br> - Oy!<br> - Hey! Come on!<br> - Nice try.<br> Go on, get in there!<br> - Do you think it's mine?<br> - What?<br> I don't know what to do.<br> She's having a baby, you know.<br> - Sure it's yours?<br> - Who else's could it be?<br> Of course it's yours. When's the last<br> time you had relations with her?<br> - Uh...<br> - Any time in the last year?<br> - No, I don't think so.<br> - Very suspicious, then.<br> If you should see her, please...<br> Oh. You sure you want her back?<br> Oh, yes, yes.<br> I love her very much.<br> Ready?<br> One, two, three!<br> - Perfect.<br> Robin Hood.<br> I saw this movie.<br> With Douglas Fairbanks.<br> Did you see that?<br> I've never seen a movie.<br> - What?<br> - Isn't it appalling?<br> You've never seen a movie?<br> Not ever?<br> Papa Georges won't let me.<br> - He's very strict about it.<br> - I love the movies.<br> My father always took me<br> for my birthday.<br> Hugo...<br> is your father dead?<br> I don't want to talk about it.<br> Isabelle...<br> do you want to have<br> an adventure?<br> We could get into trouble.<br> That's how you know it's an adventure.<br> - How did you two rats get in here?!<br> Come on!<br> And I'd better not see<br> you in here again!<br> Why doesn't Papa Georges<br> let you go to the movies?<br> I don't know. He never said.<br> I bet my parents would've let me.<br> What happened to them?<br> They died... when I was a baby.<br> But Papa Georges and Mama Jeanne,<br> they're my godparents,<br> so they took me in.<br> They're very nice about most everything,<br> except the movies.<br> My father took me<br> to the movies all the time.<br> He told me about the first one<br> he ever saw.<br> He went into a dark room,<br> and on a white screen,<br> he saw a rocket fly<br> into the eye of the man in the moon.<br> - It went straight in.<br> - Really?<br> He said it was like seeing<br> his dreams in the middle of the day.<br> The movies were our special place...<br> where we could go<br> and watch something and...<br> we didn't miss my mum so much.<br> You think about him a lot, don't you?<br> All the time.<br> Hugo, um... where do you live?<br> There.<br> My uncle taught me<br> how to run the clocks.<br> So I just keep on doing it.<br> Maybe he'll come back one day,<br> but I doubt it.<br> Aren't you afraid someone will find out?<br> Not as long as the clocks keep<br> on running and no one sees me.<br> - Act natural.<br> - What?<br> Just keep on walking.<br> Act natural.<br> How am I acting now?<br> You two, halt!<br> Come here.<br> Good day, monsieur.<br> - Where are your parents?<br> I work with my Papa Georges<br> at the toy booth.<br> Surely you've seen me there before.<br> And this is my cousin<br> from the country, Hugo.<br> You'll have to forgive him.<br> He's quite... simple-minded.<br> Doltish, really.<br> Poor thing.<br> Seems Maximilian doesn't like<br> the cut of your jib, little man.<br> He is disturbed by your physiognomy.<br> He is upset by your visage.<br> Why would he not like your face?<br> Eh?<br> Well, perhaps he smells my cat.<br> - Cat?<br> - Yes.<br> Christina Rossetti's her name,<br> after the poetess.<br> Would you like me to recite?<br> My heart is like a singing bird<br> Whose nest is in a water'd shoot<br> My heart is like an apple tree<br> Whose boughs are bent with thick-set...<br> All right, all right.<br> I know the rest.<br> That's enough poetry for today.<br> I love poetry, particularly<br> that poem by Chris... tina.<br> - Rossetti.<br> - She's... yeah.<br> She's one of my favorites.<br> I know it's Rossetti.<br> I know it's Rossetti.<br> I love poetry, just...<br> not in the station.<br> We're here to either<br> get on trains or get off them.<br> Or work in different shops,<br> is that clear?<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Watch your step.<br> Go on, go.<br> Doltish?<br> Now, since I just saved your life,<br> how about letting me see<br> your covert lair?<br> - My what?<br> - Where you live, in the walls.<br> I have to go now. I have things to do.<br> Hold on!<br> You've seen my house.<br> Isn't it about time that I saw yours?<br> After all, I am your only friend.<br> You're not my only friend.<br> Being enigmatic really doesn't suit you.<br> - What are you up to?<br> - I've got to go.<br> I should never have left<br> the station to begin with.<br> Hugo!<br> - Where did you get this?<br> - None of your business.<br> - I need it.<br> - What for?<br> I just need it.<br> Not unless...<br> Not unless you tell me why.<br> Come.<br> This is marvelous.<br> I feel just like Jean Valjean.<br> Oh, this is superlative.<br> What is that?<br> It's an automaton.<br> My father was fixing it...<br> before he died.<br> Why would my key fit<br> into your father's machine?<br> He looks sad.<br> I think he's just waiting.<br> For what?<br> To work again.<br> To do what he's supposed to do.<br> What happens when you wind him up?<br> I don't know.<br> What's the matter?<br> I know it's silly...<br> but I think it's going<br> to be a message from my father.<br> What an idiot, to think I could fix it.<br> - Hugo...<br> - It's broken!<br> It'll always be broken!<br> - Look...<br> Hugo, look, it doesn't<br> have to be like this.<br> - You can fix it.<br> - You don't...<br> You don't understand.<br> I thought...<br> if I could fix it,<br> I wouldn't be so alone.<br> Hugo!<br> Hugo, look! Look, it's not done.<br> It's not done!<br> It's not writing...<br> it's drawing.<br> That's the movie<br> my father saw.<br> Georges Mlis?<br> That's Papa Georges' name.<br> Why would your father's machine<br> sign Papa Georges' name?<br> I don't know.<br> Thank you.<br> It was a message from my father.<br> And now we have to figure it out.<br> Come on.<br> - Come on.<br> - Isabelle?<br> Mama Jeanne, we...<br> We have to talk to you.<br> This is Hugo Cabret.<br> Good evening, ma'am.<br> Very good manners... for a thief.<br> I'm not a thief.<br> What's going on, Isabelle?<br> Oh, well, it's a terribly long story<br> filled with circumlocutions,<br> but do you remember<br> several weeks ago when...<br> Wait!<br> Mama?<br> Oh, children.<br> What have you done?<br> Where did you get this?<br> You'll call me a liar.<br> No, Child.<br> A mechanical man drew it.<br> Do you have him?<br> My father found him in a museum.<br> Nobody wanted him.<br> We fixed it.<br> No, but it needed my...<br> my key.<br> - The key I gave you.<br> - No, no, Mama, he...<br> No. No, you take this away.<br> Can't dredge up the past now.<br> Whatever happens, you don't let<br> Papa Georges see it.<br> - Please tell us what's going on.<br> - Out! None of your business.<br> You must both forget this.<br> My father and I,<br> we worked hard to fix this.<br> This is all I have left of him.<br> I need to know what this means.<br> Please.<br> There are things<br> you're too young to understand.<br> You should not yet<br> know such sadness.<br> - It's Papa Georges.<br> - He can't know you're here.<br> Quiet!<br> Now just keep quiet. I'll find a way<br> to get him out of the apartment.<br> Not a noise from either of you.<br> She looked at the armoire.<br> I already searched it when<br> I was looking for your notebook.<br> I'll look again.<br> You stand guard.<br> Splendid.<br> - Where's Fizzie?<br> - You just missed her.<br> Not on the stairs? Didn't you<br> see her when you were going past?<br> - No.<br> - No? Well, um...<br> Look.<br> We have to investigate.<br> Let me. I'm taller.<br> - Knock on it.<br> - OK.<br> Back from the dead.<br> Stop. Stop, Georges.<br> - Stop it! This is your work!<br> - My work?!<br> What am I?<br> Nothing but a penniless merchant!<br> A broken windup toy.<br> I trusted you.<br> This is how you thank me.<br> You're cruel.<br> Cruel.<br> I should get back.<br> OK.<br> Thank you...<br> for the movie today. It...<br> It was a gift.<br> Sorry, I...<br> You know this volume?<br> My father and I<br> used to read it together.<br> Hmm.<br> It is intended for... my godson.<br> But now I think it is intended...<br> for you, Monsieur Cabret.<br> Might I have another cup?<br> Still brewing. Soon.<br> Demitasse, like everything else,<br> must happen at the opportune moment.<br> If we only knew when that moment was.<br> Oh, Gustave, be intrepid.<br> Say hello to her.<br> Come on, give me your best smile.<br> Your best smile.<br> It's beautiful.<br> Radiant!<br> Thank you.<br> - Oh.<br> - Mademoiselle Lisette.<br> A very gracious good evening to you.<br> - Monsieur Inspector.<br> - Hmm, yes.<br> Hmm, yes.<br> Those are lovely posies, those.<br> Thank you.<br> Yes, they're from Gourdon.<br> They come in on the overnight train,<br> so they're very fresh.<br> Ah, Gourdon.<br> Splendid country, that.<br> Robust.<br> The weather...<br> the cows and such mooing.<br> Perfectly formed udders.<br> Yeah.<br> Are they... Are they smelly?<br> Are they smelly flowers?<br> Oh, um... yes, a little.<br> They're... Please.<br> You see, I was injured in the war,<br> and it will never heal.<br> Good evening, mademoiselle.<br> I lost my brother.<br> Where?<br> Verdun.<br> Good evening, Monsieur Inspector.<br> Very good evening,<br> Mademoiselle Lisette.<br> The Film Academy library.<br> Excuse me?<br> The Film Academy library.<br> You'll find all you need<br> to know about movies there.<br> Second level, fourth row,<br> section three...<br> and, yes, top shelf.<br> The Invention of Dreams...<br> by Ren Tabard...<br> The Story of the First Movies.<br> "In 1895,<br> one of the very first films ever shown"<br> was called A Train Arrives<br> in the Station,<br> "which had nothing more than<br> a train coming into the station."<br> "" When the train came<br> speeding toward the screen,<br> the audience screamed,<br> because they thought they<br> - "were in danger of being run over."<br> "No one had ever seen<br> anything like it before."<br> "No one had ever seen<br> anything like it before."<br> "" What began as a sideshow<br> novelty soon grew into something more<br> when the first filmmakers discovered<br> "they could use the new medium<br> to tell stories. "<br> Wow.<br> "The filmmaker Georges Mlis..."<br> was one of the first<br> to realize that...<br> films had the power...<br> "...to capture dreams."<br> "The great pioneer<br> of early filmmaking died during..."<br> "...the Great War."<br> Died?<br> - During the Great War?<br> - You're interested in Mlis?<br> Uh...<br> yes.<br> It's allowed.<br> IS it?<br> He's my godfather, you see.<br> And very much alive,<br> thank you very much.<br> But that's not possible.<br> I assure you, sir...<br> it's true.<br> Why should I believe you?<br> Because...<br> Because it's true.<br> Mlis alive?<br> Shh!<br> Come with me.<br> Your godfather is a passion of mine.<br> He was a great filmmaker.<br> Here he is at work in his studio.<br> And this is a handbill<br> from his stage act.<br> Here is the great crystal mystery clock<br> made by his mentor, Robert-Houdin.<br> And this... is one of his<br> actual cameras.<br> - He was a magician?<br> - Yes. He began on the stage.<br> How did he start making movies?<br> No one really knows.<br> Look how happy he is.<br> Professor Tabard, would you perhaps...<br> like to meet him?<br> Oh... but you see, I have met him.<br> My brother worked as a carpenter<br> building sets for Mlis.<br> One day he took me to<br> visit the studio.<br> It was like...<br> something out of a dream.<br> The whole building<br> was made of glass.<br> In reality, this was to let in<br> all the sunlight necessary for filming,<br> but to my eyes,<br> it was nothing short of...<br> an enchanted castle.<br> A palace made of glass.<br> We need more light!<br> - Get the louvers opened.<br> - Open the louver, please! More!<br> Clear the set, please!<br> Everybody except actors.<br> Actors only on the set, please.<br> Clear the set!<br> Why we doing this again?<br> There was a lobster<br> in front of a mermaid.<br> OK, if that happens again,<br> shout "blocked."<br> If it's clear, give me a "clear."<br> If you've ever wondered<br> where your dreams come from...<br> you look around.<br> This is where they're made.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, the sun will set!<br> Knights in position,<br> lobsters in position.<br> Mermaids in position. Action!<br> In the end,<br> he made over 500 movies.<br> He was phenomenally<br> popular in his day.<br> But... why did he stop?<br> Up until today, I believed<br> that he died in the war...<br> like so many others.<br> Could we watch some of his movies?<br> I wish you could.<br> But time hasn't been kind to old movies.<br> This is the only one<br> that we know of that survived.<br> Out of hundreds, one.<br> And Still...<br> it is a masterpiece.<br> We've got to get Tabard<br> to show Papa Georges the film.<br> Then he'll see he's not forgotten.<br> Shouldn't I tell Mama Jeanne?<br> No. I think it should be<br> a surprise, like a magic trick.<br> We need to have some... panache.<br> Panache.<br> Well done!<br> Monsieur Claude?<br> Shh.<br> Are you up there?<br> Monsieur Claude, was that you?<br> Keep a grip onto your spanners,<br> you cack-handed oaf!<br> You can hold onto a bottle<br> well enough, can't you?<br> Are you inebriated?<br> Chateauxed, are we?<br> Shicker? Are you drunk?<br> He's passed out.<br> He's passed out, isn't he?<br> You bloated buffoon!<br> Could've hurt a child.<br> What have we here?<br> Jules Verne. Yes, indeed.<br> - Not unknown in France.<br> - One of our finest.<br> Very good plates.<br> Monsieur Labisse gave me<br> a book the other night.<br> He's always doing that,<br> sending books to a good home.<br> That's what he calls it.<br> He's got real...<br> Purpose.<br> What do you mean?<br> Everything has a purpose,<br> even machines.<br> Clocks tell the time<br> and trains take you places.<br> They do what they're meant to do.<br> Like Monsieur Labisse.<br> Maybe that's why<br> broken machines make me so sad.<br> They can't do what they're meant to do.<br> Maybe it's the same with people.<br> If you lose your purpose,<br> it's like you're broken.<br> Like Papa Georges.<br> Maybe we can fix him.<br> Is that your purpose, fixing things?<br> I don't know.<br> It's what my father did.<br> I wonder what my purpose is.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe if I had known my parents...<br> I would know.<br> Come with me.<br> Right after my father died,<br> I would come up here a lot.<br> I'd imagine the whole world<br> was one big machine.<br> Machines never come<br> with any extra parts, you know.<br> They always come with<br> the exact amount they need.<br> So I figured if the entire world<br> was one big machine...<br> I couldn't be an extra part.<br> I had to be here for some reason.<br> And that means you have<br> to be here for some reason, too.<br> Get back.<br> I'll bring Tabard<br> tomorrow night at 7:00.<br> Don't say anything.<br> Are you sure about this?<br> Not really.<br> But I think it's the only way to...<br> To fix him.<br> Hello. How was your day'?<br> Boy on the track!<br> There's a boy on the track!<br> Get out of the way!<br> There's a boy!<br> - Turn it off!<br> Get out of the way! Move!<br> Come on!<br> - Out!<br> Ahh!<br> Look out!<br> Morning.<br> Yes, he's employed here.<br> Large, uncouth man.<br> In the Seine?<br> Deceased? Are you sure?<br> No, he has no... no relatives.<br> Thank you, I'll...<br> I will gather his belongings.<br> Thank you so much.<br> If he is deceased...<br> then who has been<br> winding the clocks?<br> Good evening.<br> - This way, sir.<br> I'll get it.<br> Well, what a surprise.<br> Come in, come in.<br> Isabelle, what's the meaning of this?<br> Please don't be mad, Mama.<br> That young man is not welcome here.<br> We found out who Papa Georges is.<br> I... I deeply apologize, madame.<br> I thought you were expecting us.<br> I will leave immediately<br> and return upon your request.<br> Please keep your voices down.<br> My husband's sleeping.<br> He hasn't been well since...<br> No, Mama. Mama, please<br> don't make them leave.<br> I-I don't wish to impose<br> on you, Madame Mlis,<br> but if this is to be<br> the only time we meet,<br> please, let me express to you<br> the profound debt of gratitude<br> I owe your husband.<br> When I was a boy,<br> I saw all his films.<br> They inspired me.<br> Your husband is a very great artist.<br> Oh, I am so pleased<br> you remember my husband's films<br> with such fondness.<br> But... he's so fragile now.<br> It only hurts him to remember the past.<br> Then we will take our leave, madame.<br> And I do hope you'll<br> forgive me for saying...<br> you are as lovely now<br> as you were in the movies.<br> Mama?<br> - You were in the movies?<br> She appeared in almost all his films.<br> - You were an actress?<br> - Well, I...<br> Was a long time ago, children.<br> It was...<br> It was another time. I, uh... I...<br> Well, I was another person.<br> Would you like to meet her again?<br> We have a film.<br> One of Georges' films?<br> That's not possible. They're all gone.<br> May we show you?<br> Please.<br> - Oh, yes, please, Mama. Please.<br> Just be quick with it.<br> You were an actress,<br> a real cinema actress!<br> - It's impossibly romantic, Mama.<br> - It wasn't like that.<br> We weren't movie stars<br> like they have today.<br> But we did have fun.<br> Madame Mlis?<br> It's in color!<br> But of course.<br> We tinted the film.<br> We painted it by hand,<br> frame by frame.<br> Mama, it's you!<br> Yes.<br> Oh, beautiful.<br> You were beautiful.<br> She still is.<br> I would recognize the sound<br> of a movie projector anywhere.<br> Georges...<br> you've tried to forget<br> the past for so long.<br> It's brought you nothing<br> but unhappiness, hmm'?<br> Maybe it's time to try and remember.<br> You want to know?<br> Yes.<br> Just like you...<br> I loved to fix things.<br> I started out as a magician.<br> Mama Jeanne was my assistant.<br> We were very successful, I must say.<br> We even had our own theater.<br> But I was always tinkering<br> with machines.<br> I had my own workshop at the theater,<br> where I could invent new illusions.<br> Once, I even built a<br> working automaton.<br> Oh, he... was a particular treasure.<br> I put my heart and soul into him<br> Then, one night,<br> Mama Jeanne and I<br> went to visit a traveling circus.<br> We were walking past the sideshow tents<br> when I noticed something.<br> Something strange.<br> Something wonderful.<br> It will terrify you!<br> Sir, madame, inside we have<br> moving pictures! Come and see!<br> The Lumire brothers<br> had invented the movies.<br> I fell in love with their invention.<br> How could I not be part of it?<br> It was like...<br> It was like a new kind of magic.<br> I asked the Lumire brothers<br> to sell me a camera, but they refused.<br> You see, they were convinced<br> that movies were only a passing fad<br> and they saw no future in it,<br> or so they said.<br> In the end, I built my own camera<br> using leftover pieces<br> from the automaton.<br> I just had to be a part<br> of this new wonder.<br> We risked everything. And we sold<br> the theater and everything we had<br> so we could build<br> our own movie studio.<br> Excellent.<br> Cameras, are we clear?<br> And so the great adventure began.<br> Actors only on the set, please!<br> Clear the set!<br> Look at you, look at you!<br> Love this shape, Mel.<br> It's a toile, though, right?<br> I wrote, designed, directed, and acted<br> in hundreds of movies.<br> I'm ready.<br> Oh, that was good,<br> that was good, yes, yes.<br> That felt good, that felt good.<br> On the pulley? On the smoke?<br> Stop, stop, stop. I saw that.<br> Give me two minutes.<br> It was good up to there.<br> Benny'? I'm gonna have a word.<br> Reload. Reset the dragon.<br> Benny, speak to me.<br> If you pull down a little harder<br> on the left-hand rope,<br> the head will come up higher,<br> which will be better...<br> - Under the belly!<br> - I see it.<br> Excellent, excellent, excellent.<br> The choreography was really good<br> up to there. Thank you, gentlemen.<br> - First positions!<br> - Back, first positions!<br> Action!<br> Excellent, excellent.<br> Setting back.<br> And in for the kill, knights.<br> In for the kill!<br> Come on, then, attack!<br> Stabbing, stabbing, and lunge!<br> Good.<br> Good, good. Good, knights.<br> Poised for the attack.<br> And... knights!<br> Three, two, one, freeze!<br> Skeletons, that's great.<br> You can go.<br> Pyrotechnics in, please.<br> Knights, please don't move.<br> Freeze. Freeze, everybody.<br> Wait for my "action."<br> Three, two, one, action!<br> Magic tricks and illusion<br> became my spaciality.<br> The world of imagination.<br> My beautiful wife<br> was my muse, my star.<br> And we couldn't have been happier.<br> Action!<br> We thought it would never end.<br> How could it?<br> But then the war came.<br> - And youth and hope were at an end.<br> The world had no time<br> for magic tricks and movie shows.<br> The returning soldiers,<br> having seen so much of reality,<br> were bored by my films.<br> Tastes had changed,<br> but I had not changed with them.<br> No one wanted my movies any more.<br> Eventually I...<br> I couldn't pay the actors...<br> or keep the business<br> running, and...<br> and so my enchanted castle<br> fell to ruin.<br> Everything was lost.<br> One night, in bitter despair, I...<br> I burned all my old sets<br> and costumes.<br> I was forced to sell my movies<br> to a company<br> that melted them down<br> into chemicals.<br> These chemicals were used<br> to make shoe heels.<br> With the little money I had from selling<br> my films, I bought the toy booth...<br> and there I have remained.<br> The only thing I couldn't<br> bring myself to destroy<br> was my beloved automaton.<br> So I gave him to a museum,<br> hoping he would find a home.<br> But they never put him on display.<br> And then the museum burned.<br> It's all gone now.<br> Everything I ever made.<br> Nothing but ashes<br> and fading strips of celluloid.<br> My life has taught me<br> one lesson, Hugo,<br> and not the one I thought it would.<br> Happy endings only happen in the movies.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Stop that! No, no!<br> Don't you frighten Monsieur Frick.<br> Schatzi, what's he got?<br> What has he got?<br> Oh, my goodness.<br> Oh, my goodness me.<br> Did you see that?<br> Be brave. My brave soldier.<br> Oh! Monsieur Frick, I am undone!<br> - Good evening.<br> - Ah, hello.<br> There has been<br> a disquieting development.<br> - What is it?<br> - You know Monsieur Claude?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - He's been found deceased.<br> - No.<br> - Monsieur Claude!<br> Consequently, he will no longer be<br> employed here winding the clocks.<br> You've got a little friend. Look!<br> - Oh, hello.<br> - Hello.<br> - Monsieur Claude is dead.<br> What? Why'?<br> What happened to him?<br> They found his corpse in the Seine.<br> It's been down there<br> for many months, it seems.<br> Can't say I'm surprised.<br> He was an inebriant<br> of the highest order.<br> - Well, yes, he was a drunk.<br> - Shoo.<br> - Oh, I wouldn't say that.<br> - Yes, he was a drunk!<br> Scram! Shoo!<br> He could've drunk<br> the entire River Seine.<br> - Please, go away! Go! Shh.<br> - Hold it!<br> - Let me go! Let me go!<br> - Did you think you'd escape me?<br> - Gustave, have a heart!<br> - Please, help me!<br> Please.<br> - No.<br> He's been undermining<br> this station for too long.<br> Come on!<br> - What's the boy done?<br> - Let me go!<br> - You happy now, boy?!<br> - Don't do this!<br> Do not leave my office.<br> You don't understand,<br> I've got to go.<br> You'll go nowhere<br> until your parents are found.<br> I don't have any!<br> Then it's straight<br> to the orphanage with you.<br> You'll learn a thing or two there.<br> I certainly did.<br> How to follow orders.<br> How to keep to yourself.<br> How to survive without a family.<br> Because you don't need one.<br> You don't need a family.<br> Police headquarters,<br> Yes, it's me again.<br> Another orphan.<br> Has been a busy week.<br> Oh, trespass, theft, pilfering,<br> littering, pillorying,<br> walking about, playing.<br> It's irrelevant.<br> Please come and pick him up.<br> Anyway, how are you?<br> Oh, she came back?<br> Oh, you think it's yours?<br> Excellent.<br> Well, I suppose you'll find out<br> in seven months.<br> Pardon me. Oh, in March?<br> I'll try to come.<br> I... I tend not to plan<br> that far ahead.<br> Are you sure?<br> Well, oh, that's very flattering.<br> I don't know really whether it's<br> appropriate for me to be the godfa...<br> Oh! Sir, hold on!<br> Maximilian!<br> Move!<br> Move aside! Get out of the way!<br> Maximilian, find him!<br> You can't escape me!<br> There's nowhere to hide up there, boy!<br> Maximilian, he's gone<br> the other way. Come on!<br> You!<br> Get out of my way!<br> Got you!<br> - Oof!<br> No! Oh!<br> There's a boy! Turn it off!<br> There's a boy on the track!<br> Get out of the way!<br> Move back! Move aside!<br> Move back!<br> What were you thinking?<br> Are you injured?<br> - Come on!<br> Stand aside. Careful.<br> We'll let the orphanage<br> deal with you.<br> - No, I don't belong there!<br> - Where do you belong?<br> A child has to belong to somewhere.<br> Listen to me, please!<br> Please, listen to me!<br> You don't understand.<br> You have to let me go.<br> I don't understand<br> why my father died.<br> Why I'm alone.<br> This is my only chance...<br> to work.<br> You should understand!<br> I do!<br> I do.<br> Monsieur...<br> this child belongs to me.<br> I'm sorry. He's broken.<br> No, he's not.<br> He worked perfectly.<br> Honored guests, I am proud<br> to welcome you to this gala<br> celebrating the life and work<br> of Georges Mlis!<br> For years, most of his films<br> were thought to be lost.<br> Indeed, Monsieur Mlis<br> believed so himself.<br> But we began a search.<br> We looked through vaults,<br> through private collections,<br> barns and catacombs.<br> Our work was rewarded<br> with old negatives,<br> boxes of prints, and trunks<br> full of decaying film,<br> which we were able to save.<br> We now have over 80 films<br> by Georges Mlis.<br> And tonight, their creator,<br> and the newest member<br> of the Film Academy faculty,<br> is here to share them with you.<br> Bravo!<br> Bravo!<br> Ladies and gentlemen...<br> I...<br> I am standing<br> before you tonight...<br> because of one<br> very brave young man...<br> who saw a broken machine...<br> and against all odds, he fixed it.<br> It was the kindest magic trick...<br> that ever I've seen.<br> And now, my friends,<br> I address you all tonight<br> as you truly are:<br> Wizards, mermaids...<br> travelers, adventurers...<br> magicians.<br> Come and dream with me.<br> Yes, you can start with the thaumatrope,<br> the zoetrope, the praxinoscope.<br> Any study of the history of film<br> must begin with the...<br> Poppy'? The cave pictographs at...<br> - Niaux.<br> - Niaux.<br> About canine socialization.<br> Not canine romance?<br> Oh, Monsieur Frick, do I detect<br> a pearl in your oyster?<br> The boy designed it.<br> It does not squeak at all.<br> Don't forget to smile, darling.<br> Well, which one?<br> I've mastered three of them.<br> Don't worry.
