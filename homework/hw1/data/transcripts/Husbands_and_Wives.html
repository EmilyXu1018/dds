                        Einstein was then celebrating...<br> ...the 70th birthday anniversary...<br> ...and there was a colloquium|given for him.<br> And he said:<br> "God doesn't play dice|with the universe. "<br> No, he just plays hide-and-seek.<br> Learn to write screenplays,|television scripts, plays...<br> Jesus, they're so full of it.<br> You can't teach writing.|You expose students...<br> ...to good work and hope|it inspires them.<br> Some can write,|others will never learn.<br> You lose patience|if the student isn't Dostoyevsky.<br> No, that isn't true. That's crazy.<br> It's worth it when you get|a gifted pupil.<br> A girl in my class|wrote a great story:<br> "Oral Sex in the Age of|Deconstruction."<br> - It's full of insight, romantic...|- They're here.<br> Jack will wanna take us|for Chinese food again.<br> I think Sally's tired|of our pasta places.<br> - Hi.|- Is it supposed to rain?<br> Hi.<br> Let me take your coat.<br> I opened some white wine.|You want some?<br> They're doing something at 80th.<br> Jack? You want some cold white wine?<br> When I go to your place, it's murder.<br> So, Chinese, right? I can't|talk you into Italian?<br> Listen, don't get crazy, you know?<br> Before we go out to dinner|we wanna tell you something.<br> - You want to?|- Go ahead.<br> - What? What?|- Somebody tell us.<br> Jack and I are splitting up.<br> Oh, I see. It's just...|Nothing serious.<br> We discussed this for a long time|and we both think it's for the best.<br> You are joking, of course.<br> Don't make a big deal, okay?|We're fine.<br> - Are you serious?|- We are. We're fine.<br> - We both... We discussed it.|- It's mutual.<br> What do you mean?<br> Let's go talk about this at dinner.<br> I'm not going out to dinner.<br> Since when has this been decided?|What are we talking about here?<br> We've been discussing it.<br> Don't be worried.|There's no hostility.<br> You see? We're fine.<br> - What is the reason?|- Don't...<br> Gabe, it's none of our business.<br> Don't turn this into a tragedy.|It's a positive thing.<br> How can you break up? It's insane.<br> You're Jack and Sally.|You got two kids.<br> Our kids are grown up.|They're in college.<br> We won't bore you with details.<br> I can't get my mind around this.|Since when? You get along so well.<br> She's right.|Have you met other people?<br> Gabe, it's not our business.<br> - I'm fascinated by this.|- I feel sick.<br> We didn't wanna ruin anything.<br> - We wanna see what it's like to be...|- Apart for a while.<br> Don't not support us.|We've gotten the nerve...<br> This is insanity.|You'll be back together...<br> She's keeping the place in Riverdale.|I'm looking for a place in town.<br> I just feel shattered.<br> - Oh, come on, Judy.|- I do.<br> Come on, let's eat.<br> What do you mean,|"Come on, let's eat"?<br> "Come on"? I can't eat.<br> - Don't get angry.|- I'm not!<br> - I'm not angry!|- I knew it.<br> You march in here and announce|you're breaking up?<br> You have two kids!|Why are you doing this?<br> This is not our business.<br> Why not? They're our|closest friends!<br> There is no one traumatic event.<br> People grow apart. It's a lot of|little personal things. Now stop it.<br> I don't wanna hear this bullshit.<br> - Why is she so upset?|- Judy...<br> She cares about us.<br> Well, I care about you too.<br> - We're fine, okay?|- Judy!<br> - We wanna do this.|- This is crazy.<br> Why are you taking|this so personally?<br> I'm upset! All right?|Can't I be upset?<br> I've discussed this in therapy.<br> You have? You never said a word!<br> - You said this wasn't our business.|- We were all so close!<br> I assumed we were.<br> She's very upset.<br> Will you please not|turn this into a wake?<br> Why is this such a personal thing|for you? I don't know what to say.<br> Let's just go out to dinner|and forget it.<br> - Judy, come on!|- I knew this would happen.<br> So why were you so upset?<br> I don't know. I really don't know.<br> - It was a total shock?|- Yeah, completely.<br> They were so casual about it.<br> They didn't seem to be|appropriately upset.<br> Were you hurt because Sally never|mentioned anything to you?<br> Well...<br> I think, if I look hard...|Searching over the time...<br> ...when we were alone together...<br> She may have occasionally|remarked about wondering...<br> ...what it would be like|to be single.<br> Now, with all she knew, all she'd|experienced. That kind of thing.<br> But she never said anything|negative about Jack.<br> Before we go on, tell us|something about yourself.<br> So we know who you are.<br> Okay. My name is Judy Roth.|I'm married to Gabe.<br> We've been married about 10 years.<br> I work for an art magazine.|We don't have any children.<br> I have a daughter|from a previous marriage.<br> I was married when I was very young,|to an architect.<br> It didn't work out.|It's nobody's fault.<br> Judy told us they did|finally go to dinner.<br> She said she was tense and nervous,|although the others seemed fine.<br> Afterwards, they walked home.<br> She tried to participate,|but found the atmosphere strained.<br> All in all, she said,|it was a very peculiar evening.<br> It's amazing, isn't it?<br> You think you're friendly|with people and it turns out...<br> ...you really have no idea|what they're thinking.<br> Do you ever hide things from me?<br> Me? What kind of things?<br> I don't know. Feelings, you know.<br> Longings. Complaints.<br> No.<br> - Do you?|- No.<br> Sometimes, maybe.<br> Really? Like what?<br> I don't know. You know how|you're always so critical?<br> We've had this conversation.<br> You're definitely in a strange|mood tonight.<br> I'm fine. I'm sorry.<br> Jack never gave you an inkling?|It's strange, you guys are so close.<br> I remember one incident|he mentioned at his office.<br> Jack, trust me on this.<br> This girl is to die.<br> Shawn Grainger, she's built|out to here.<br> You will have the time of your life.<br> And for $200, believe me,|it's a bargain.<br> I'm not gonna do it.|What about AIDS?<br> She's not a whore.|She's a high-class call girl.<br> She'll do anything you want.|And on top of it, she's got friends.<br> What about my wife? It's dangerous.<br> Who was the guy who told me...<br> ...that your sex life|wasn't so terrific?<br> Come on, at a two-martini|lunch I'll say anything.<br> Shawn has got a mouth|like velvet. Believe me.<br> She was a former|Miss Something-or-Other.<br> What exactly did I say at lunch?<br> You said that Sally was cold,|and you were...<br> ...dying to fuck|your aerobics trainer.<br> I should never drink at lunch.<br> I'm gonna write down the number.<br> - I advise you to...|- What are you doing?<br> Hey. What...?<br> Have I steered you wrong?<br> - I've never...|- Get out of here.<br> There it is. Use it.<br> He called. I thought it was about|a month after he got my number.<br> He was polite on the phone.|A little tense.<br> I can always tell who's inexperienced.<br> He wanted to meet|at the Americana Hotel.<br> When I got there he was very polite,|very gentlemanly. Very nervous.<br> He couldn't go through with it.|He couldn't get it up.<br> He had pains in his chest.|I thought it was...<br> ...a heart attack, but they passed.<br> - That was the last you saw of him?|- He called a couple of months later.<br> We met at the same hotel.|This time he slept with me.<br> Then I started seeing him fairly|regularly, every two, three weeks.<br> He said he'd seen a psychiatrist|and worked out his problem.<br> Once I couldn't make it|so I sent a friend.<br> Then he started seeing both of us.<br> Then neither one of us|ever saw him again.<br> - At least he threw the number away.|- Well, as far as I know.<br> But Jack is not a hooker guy.<br> He's very strait-laced.<br> And Sally's cold in bed.<br> That's no surprise.|She's very cerebral.<br> Am I cold in bed?<br> No. Why would you say that?<br> But I'm inhibited, right?|You said that.<br> You can't forget that.|We had one minor argument years ago.<br> Which you blew up into|a major confrontation...<br> Do you ever want to sleep|with a whore?<br> Me? No, definitely not.<br> When I was in college, I did.<br> Yeah?<br> You're in an odd mood. Their breakup|has definitely affected you.<br> You think...<br> You think we'd ever break up?<br> What? I'm not planning it, are you?<br> - No.|- Okay.<br> But I don't know how I'll feel if you|still don't wanna make me pregnant.<br> Are we gonna have that|conversation again?<br> - You have a daughter...|- Yeah.<br> I want another.<br> Why?<br> It's cruel to bring life|into this terrible world.<br> Don't glorify your refusal|on philosophical grounds.<br> You should see the angry look|on your face when you say that.<br> You wanna make love?<br> Okay, if we can get|into it in some way.<br> - I can't just do it on command.|- We can get into it.<br> Okay, so put your diaphragm on.<br> You'd never say you were|putting your diaphragm on...<br> ...and then not do it, right?<br> What?<br> What a thing to say!<br> That's a terrible thing to say.<br> You really trust no one. No wonder|people accuse you of cynicism.<br> - Okay. I apologize.|- Jesus!<br> - I'm tired. It's 1 a.m.|- We don't have to do it.<br> - Are you still attracted to me?|- Yes, I am.<br> - Truly?|- Of course.<br> - We do it less and less.|- Our schedules are not exactly...<br> When we wanted to, we found time.<br> - Come here.|- Parties, people's bathrooms...<br> Sit and relax for a minute, will you?<br> If you remember clearly, when we|used to do that spontaneous sex...<br> ...you never really liked it.|You were always tense.<br> You always heard people|in the next room making noises.<br> Now you remember it|in a glorified way.<br> - Are you ever attracted to other women?|- Like who?<br> Like all the women you have in class,|who are so talented and insightful.<br> I'm sure they worship you.<br> Can I tell you that they don't|want an old man? All right?<br> I think an old man does better|than an old woman.<br> Then we're definitely|stuck with one another.<br> Now, come on. You're really...<br> Come on.<br> Some time later,|Sally had a date with Paul...<br> ...a colleague at work|who had always liked her.<br> - Sally. Come in.|- Thank you very much.<br> Come into my rent-stabilized den.<br> - Can I take your coat?|- It's lovely.<br> I love it. Thank you.<br> I thought we'd have a drink.<br> I was able to get tickets|to Don Giovanni.<br> - Great.|- You all right?<br> - What would you like?|- Anything. White wine?<br> White wine.<br> I hear the staging of this opera|is not to be believed.<br> Oh, really? How fabulous.<br> That's lovely.<br> Oh, hey, don't worry about it.|I'll get it later.<br> - Can I use the phone?|- Yeah, sure. You all right?<br> - I'm looking forward to it.|- This way.<br> A good friend of mine did the sets.<br> It's me. You are living with her,|aren't you? You've moved in together.<br> Don't lie to me, Jack. You are.<br> Because I know.<br> Because I do.<br> Yes, I heard.<br> It's been three fucking weeks!<br> How did you meet someone so fast?<br> Bullshit. You had to have|known her before.<br> Bullshit! Don't give me that shit!<br> Oh, you're in love?<br> So fast?<br> I don't fucking believe it!<br> You were seeing whoever it is|all along.<br> Of course, I expected things|to happen. But not so fast!<br> Are you that sure?<br> No, I'm not.<br> Oh, God, it's just fucking|dishonest bullshit!<br> Hi, you...?<br> I'm fine.<br> - If you're having a personal...|- Really. I'm okay.<br> I'm looking forward to tonight.|What are we seeing?<br> Don Giovanni.<br> A Don Juan story.<br> I can only think of it as Mozart.<br> Fucking Don Juans.<br> They should have cut his|fucking dick off.<br> Can I get you some more wine?<br> Please.<br> You know, we don't have to go.<br> No. I'm not gonna|put my life on hold.<br> I've been dying to see this opera.<br> - Excuse me one second.|- Sure.<br> Hello. Me again.<br> I know who she is.<br> Bullshit! It's Gail.<br> She's been after you since she joined|the firm. You both like sports!<br> Don't lie to me, Jack.<br> She's your type.|She's got that look.<br> She's bright and all that|Princeton bullshit! No!<br> I thought it was an experiment!|I didn't think it was final.<br> I didn't realize you were|having an affair!<br> That's bullshit! I don't|buy a fucking word of it!<br> - What time do we have to be there?|- Listen...<br> ...I don't really think I can|do this. I'm feeling upset.<br> What are you upset about? Fucking men!<br> A woman gets to this age,|it's a different ball game.<br> Don't defend your sex! It's true!<br> It's great till you start to show your|age, then they want a newer model.<br> Sally.<br> Sally, you're...<br> You're a very attractive woman,|for any age.<br> It was a terrible blow to my ego.|I thought he loved me.<br> That we were experimenting.<br> But if you had met someone first?<br> Probably right.<br> Probably would've done|the same thing.<br> I had fantasized about|being single many times.<br> It's hard to keep a marriage|going smoothly.<br> All the frustration and baggage.|I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Gail came to his office|the year before.<br> I'd met her several times.<br> Look, what can I say? She's...<br> ...cultivated, intelligent.<br> It's what he likes.<br> She'd been over to the house|a few times.<br> She loved my taste in everything.|She even dressed like me.<br> What can I say?|She's me, but she's younger.<br> Listen, your short story|was absolutely fabulous.<br> - Really?|- Yeah.<br> I was very impressed, I must say.<br> It was probably the best this term.<br> - It was wonderful.|- That's great!<br> The insights were great,|the prose was very graceful.<br> You know, in general, I was impressed.<br> - God, I'm blushing, right?|- Well, don't...<br> My face gets all red.<br> I may just cry.<br> Well, don't take it that badly.|I meant it as a compliment.<br> It was great. Wonderful.<br> Your approbation means|more than anybody's.<br> You're the reason why|I wanted to write.<br> - Really?|- Yeah.<br> My family and I, we used to quote|"The Grey Hat."<br> How do you remember that story?<br> "Giving up his hopes...<br> ...compromising one's dreams,|is like putting on a grey hat."<br> I love that!<br> You remember that. That's great.<br> Listen.

It leads up to him.<br> My father's business partner,|he'd come by the house fairly often.<br> And one day, he told me that|he was in love with me, right?<br> I was very flattered,|to say the least.<br> He was real bright and single.<br> We started having this affair.|Naturally, we told nobody.<br> I have this friend, Jane.|Her parents were divorced.<br> Her father, Jerry, developed this|mad crush over me, right?<br> And before long, I was seeing|both these men.<br> Instead of being happy,|I was just miserable.<br> I couldn't get my feelings|straight, so I went to an analyst.<br> I tried for a few months|to work things out.<br> Then, one day, he said|he was gonna stop treating me...<br> ...because he felt|it wasn't the thing to do...<br> ...since he was falling|in love with me.<br> I was taken with him. You can|imagine, he's quite brilliant.<br> And I started seeing him.<br> I did.|I broke off from the other two.<br> Something inside me|told me he couldn't...<br> ...be a very stable person,|let alone a good analyst.<br> So I never really let things|get too far with him.<br> Then one night I met Carl.<br> He was very sweet and|he really came on with me.<br> I came to my senses.|I said to myself:<br> "What am I doing with|these older men?"<br> So I cleaned up my act|and I've been dating Carl.<br> As you can see, Richard is so|unstable. He really took it badly.<br> God! You've got material for your|first novel and the sequel...<br> ...and an opera by Puccini here!|This is incredible.<br> Yes, but don't you think I'm right?|I mean, Carl, he's fun.<br> What the hell am I doing|with the midlife crisis set?<br> They're all wonderful,|rather accomplished men.<br> In the end, I felt like|I was a symbol of lost youth...<br> ...or unfulfilled dreams.|Am I being dramatic?<br> Gabe.<br> Rain's birthday is coming|up, and we'd love you to come.<br> - I don't know.|- He doesn't want to come.<br> We would love you to come|for a drink. You and your wife.<br> Mom, he's not gonna|come to my birthday.<br> You've been a great influence|on her. Inspirational.<br> Well, she's great.<br> I'd consider it an honor|if you'd come by.<br> Just as Gabe gave his manuscript to|Rain, Judy also showed her writing.<br> Listen, I finally got around to|reading these lovely poems.<br> - You can be honest.|- I am.<br> - It's just a hobby.|- I was moved. They're full of feeling.<br> - What does your husband say?|- I'd never show them to him.<br> He'd be much too critical.|He has very high standards.<br> - He'd be right too.|- The two you wrote about New England?<br> There's a graveyard there|where I'd love to be buried.<br> I used to say to Amy,|that's the place I'd choose too.<br> - Do you want to eat lunch outside?|- Sure.<br> - Are you soaked?|- No. What about you?<br> I think just my coat.<br> - Your hair's wet.|- Is it?<br> Thank you, Annie.<br> - That was fun.|- Yes. My hair's a mess.<br> Listen...<br> - Judy, can I speak frankly to you?|- Sure.<br> - Thanks for introducing me to Sally.|- Oh. Oh, yeah.<br> - I think I'm in love with her.|- Gee, that was quick.<br> Not that she shares my feelings|or ever will.<br> - She hasn't been single that long.|- Yeah, but it's like...<br> ...I like someone and can't|wait for the other shoe to fall.<br> You probably had...<br> You're just a little gun-shy|from some bad experiences.<br> Is she as terrific as she seems?<br> She is.|She's wonderful. She's...<br> ...honest and decent...|I can't say enough good things.<br> Thank you, Judy. You know|I respect your opinion.<br> Do you mind if l...?<br> I'm just feeling a little funny.<br> - I'll get you a...|- I'm fine.<br> I don't know why I introduced them.|Why did I push them together?<br> When obviously,|I had feelings for him myself.<br> I was just confused.|I didn't know what I wanted.<br> You look good. You don't get any|older. You work out, huh?<br> Since Sally and I broke up, I'm single.|I gotta watch it, you know?<br> I saw Sally the other night.|She's dating some guy.<br> Nice-looking.|Claire can tell you.<br> Yeah, I think...|What was he? He's an editor.<br> So...<br> What's the deal? Are they|seeing one another or...?<br> We don't know.<br> I'm drunk, so don't hold me|responsible. You gave up a great one.<br> Ken!|He's having a good time.<br> No, he's right. I know.|Look, we were together a lot of years.<br> She's a great lady.<br> She'll be all right. This guy,|Michael something, seemed fine.<br> - Let's go.|- I'm not out of line.<br> You're okay, right? That girl,|Samantha, should be in the Olympics.<br> What do you think?|Are they serious?<br> - Don't know.|- What did she say?<br> We didn't talk.|For a few minutes we...<br> She looked great.|Has she had face work?<br> - Face work?|- We gotta go. Good to see you.<br> Where is Sam?<br> If astrology were true,|twins would have the same fate.<br> - It is totally provable!|- From gypsies?<br> Why wouldn't it have an influence|on our personalities?<br> You know who believes this?|My baby-sitter.<br> There is more crime|during the full moon.<br> Well, who knows?<br> It's like the|universe knows this stuff.<br> You guys just don't get|the fundamental basics...<br> You should meet my baby-sitter.|She doesn't know anyone in New York.<br> - She's been with me two months.|- Fabulous...<br> - My ex-wife believed in this.|- You should listen to her.<br> I'm just making a point.|Because the position...<br> ...of the planets|is crucial to your life.<br> I can't stress this enough.|And your body...<br> - Be logical.|- But I'm totally logical.<br> I would not put a Sagittarius...<br> Sam, we gotta go.

I came close.|- What makes it so difficult for you?<br> My mind gets racing with thoughts.|You'd laugh.<br> - I get so mentally hyperactive.|- Like what?<br> I liked what Michael|was doing to me...<br> ...and it felt different|from Jack. More gentle.<br> And... more exciting.<br> How different|Michael was from Jack.<br> How much deeper his|vision of life was.<br> And I thought...<br> ...Michael was a hedgehog...<br> ...and Jack was a fox.<br> And then I thought...<br> ...Judy was a fox...<br> ...and Gabe was a hedgehog.<br> And I thought about all|the people I knew...<br> ...and which were hedgehogs...<br> ...and which were foxes.<br> Al Simon, a friend,|was a hedgehog.<br> His wife, Jenny, was a hedgehog.<br> And Cindy Salkind was a fox.<br> And Lou Patrino was a hedgehog.<br> I had the impression that|at times...<br> ...you weren't quite into it.<br> No. No!<br> I mean...<br> You know...<br> I told you the problems|I've had with Jack.<br> No!<br> It was wonderful.<br> I've hurt your feelings, right?<br> Don't get the wrong impression.|I loved it.<br> Me too.<br> I used to get excited|when we got married.<br> Somewhere along the line,|it slipped away.<br> It's okay.<br> What? That I'm not responsive?<br> We had a nice experience.<br> We had two separate, nice experiences.<br> - But they were nice.|- They were separate.<br> - No wonder your husband went crazy.|- Very funny.<br> Oh, come on, Sally.<br> - You hungry?|- He said, changing the subject.<br> Oh, stop it.<br> What was that?<br> - There's been some burglaries.|- Is the alarm on?<br> Well, call the police.<br> - Who are you?|- Who are you?<br> - Jack, my God!|- You changed the lock on my own house.<br> - Who's this?|- This is my husband.<br> - None of your business. Leave.|- I don't want to.<br> - Are you all right?|- Am I all right?<br> Is he living here?<br> - Don't get upset.|- Is he fucking you?<br> - This is my house, pal.|- Let's not get ugly.<br> I can talk to him.

Listen.|God, I...<br> This was not all my fault.|It takes two of us...<br> - I didn't say it was all your fault.|- You're so hard to live with!<br> I would just break my back|all the time. See?

No! I can't discuss this now.|Please! Go!<br> - You'll feel better tomorrow.|- I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow.<br> Oh, shit.<br> Hi. I need to speak to Jack.<br> - You're gonna leave me out there?|- I told you...<br> I have never been treated|this way before!<br> - Perfect how you ruin a life.|- Then see a psychiatrist.<br> - I need to see a shrink, slimebag!|- Come on in.<br> This is about all of us.<br> - We don't have any secrets here.|- Bullshit.<br> - I never met a Scorpio who wasn't...|- Will you stop?!<br> I'm going to bed.|Get out. Both of you!<br> What's the big deal?<br> So I did some things wrong.|Does it have to be irreversible?<br> The heart raged,|grew melancholy and confused...<br> ...and toward what end? To articulate|what nitwit strategy? Procreation?<br> It told him something.|How mind-boggling numbers of sperm...<br> ...competed for a single egg,|not the other way around.<br> Men would make|love with any number of women...<br> ...even total strangers,|while females were selective.<br> They were catering|to the demands of one small egg.<br> While males had millions of|frantic sperms screaming:<br> "Let us out, let us out!"<br> It was like personal ads.<br> Dozens of requirements followed by,|"Non-smokers only."<br> Feldman longed to meet an attractive|woman with this personality:<br> A sense of humor equal to his,|a love of sports equal to his...<br> ...a love of music equal to his|and a love of...<br> ...Bach and balmy climates.|In short, himself as a pretty woman.<br> Pepkin married and led a warm,|domestic life.<br> Placid, but dull.|Knapp was a swinger.<br> He eschewed nuptial ties|and bedded different women:<br> Students, housewives, nurses, actresses|a doctor, a salesgirl...<br> they all held Knapp between their legs.<br> Pepkin, from the calm of his|fidelity, envied Knapp.<br> Knapp, lonely beyond belief,|envied Pepkin.<br> What happened after the honeymoon?|Did desire grow...<br> ...or did familiarity make partners|want other lovers?<br> Was the notion of|ever-deepening romance a myth...<br> ...along with simultaneous orgasm?<br> The only time Rifkin and his wife|experienced one...<br> ...was when they were granted|their divorce.<br> Maybe in the end, the idea was|not to expect too much out of life.<br> So the book was wonderful.<br> Entertaining,|imaginative and moving...<br> You don't have to say this. You|can be critical. Be honest.<br> You make suffering so funny.<br> The lost souls running around.<br> That's funny. I've had so much trouble|with the book.<br> - Has anybody else read it?|- Not exactly, you know.<br> I'm so thrilled you feel this way.|I can't tell you how encouraged I am.<br> Your feelings|about it are really...<br> But you are a sucker for my work.|I shouldn't get too excited.<br> I'm objective and, yes,|I do love the way you write.<br> - I had some criticisms...|- I'm sure you did.<br> What were they?<br> Nothing serious.|The whole thing was just a delight.<br> Really? I've had such a love-hate|relationship with this book.<br> - Oh my God, this can't be...|- What?<br> I think I left it in the cab.<br> You're kidding! In a taxicab?|Are you sure?<br> I can't believe I did this to you!|Okay, he was Indian.<br> You left it in an Indian's cab?<br> No. He was Armenian.<br> That was the only copy.<br> - I know.|- You must be joking.<br> - Hargopian?|- Mr. Hargopian, Swami Hargopian, what?<br> I was totally crushed.|I wanted to die.<br> This was the worst thing that happened.<br> - You put up a false front.|- The poor girl was wrecked.<br> I was trying to bail her out.<br> So this book was very meaningful|to you despite what you said.<br> - I guess so.|- And the young woman, Rain?<br> Her approbation was|very significant to me.<br> Why was her encouragement|so pleasing?<br> Your own wife liked it very much|and you gave her a hard time.<br> I don't know. There was some kind|of rapport I felt here that was...<br> ...meaningful.<br> Hey! Hey!|Somebody found your envelope.<br> They're waiting at the house now.<br> It's... It's so Freudian.<br> What is?<br> The whole thing, leaving|the novel in the cab.<br> Don't be silly.|It could happen to anybody.<br> No, I think maybe it meant something.<br> - Like what?|- Well...<br> ...I don't know.|Maybe I could have been threatened.<br> - Threatened by my book?|- Yeah.<br> - I'm very competitive by nature.|- That's absurd.<br> Why, because I'm a young female?<br> Don't get angry.|I'm in your corner.<br> - I'm your biggest fan.|- Yeah.<br> I just think I could have been|threatened by certain things.<br> Like what?<br> Some of the attitudes towards|women and your ideas on life.<br> - You told me you loved the book.|- I do. I do love it.<br> - What were your criticisms?|- Nothing.<br> Tell me your criticisms.<br> I was a little disappointed|with some of your attitudes.<br> Like what? What attitudes? With what?<br> The way people just|casually have affairs like that.<br> The book doesn't condone affairs.|I'm exaggerating for comedy.<br> Are our choices really between chronic|dissatisfaction and suburban drudgery?<br> I'm deliberately distorting it.|I'm trying to show...<br> ...how hard it is to be married.<br> You have to be careful not to|trivialize things like that.<br> Jesus, I hope I haven't.<br> The lead character's|views on women...<br> ...is so retrograde, so shallow.<br> What?|You told me it was a great book.<br> I never said great, I said it's...<br> ...brilliant and it's alive.<br> We're not arguing about|whether it's brilliant or not.<br> Triumph of the Will was a great|movie, but you despise its ideology.<br> So you despise my ideas?<br> No, I don't despise them.|That example was...<br> Isn't it beneath you as a thinker...<br> ...to allow your lead character|to waste so much energy...<br> ...obsessing over a psychotic woman...<br> ...that you fantasize as powerfully|sexual and inspired...<br> ...when she was pitifully sick.<br> I don't need a lecture on writing|from a 20-year-old twit.<br> You asked to read my book,|you said you loved it...<br> - And I do.|- You leave it in a taxicab.<br> You're weeping, I'm consoling you|and you turn on me.<br> Okay. Well, I must have hit a nerve.<br> Well, yeah. You know...<br> I'd hate to be your boyfriend.|He must go through hell.<br> Well, I'm worth it.<br> - Any trouble finding the house?|- No, it was very easy.<br> Please. Step this way.<br> I'm so glad you found the house.<br> - This was so nice.|- It's fine.<br> I jumped in the cab and wound|up sitting on it.<br> That's so nice of you.|Let me give you some...<br> - No, it's okay.|- Really, I can't...<br> - I want you to stay for coffee.|- No, you're...<br> - I won't take no for...|- She won't.<br> - We'll have coffee.|- Okay, good.<br> - I'm sorry...|- I'm sorry, it was my fault.<br> It was totally...<br> If you don't mind my saying,|you have a beautiful daughter.<br> I admit it,|her argument in the cab...<br> ...I found attractive.|It attracted me to her.<br> That she was not a passive,|worshipful pupil.<br> Something in me sensed...<br> ...not that I'd|do anything about it...<br> ...I had, you know,|certain daydreams about it.<br> A week later,|Jack and Sally reunited.<br> This was celebrated over dinner.<br> You can't just wipe out|years of closeness.<br> You think you can.|But the roots are there.<br> I think some people are just not|meant to be single.<br> Everybody screws up.|The question is...<br> ...do you learn from it?<br> I think the true test is|how you weather a crisis.<br> Everyone looks great when|everything's going smoothly.<br> It's great. If you can be|that mature, it's great.<br> It's not that. You just start...<br> ...thinking about priorities.<br> How long can you discuss|physical fitness and the zodiac?<br> And this Michael character|was no bargain.<br> - How was Michael?|- I don't know, he was sick.<br> I gave him a call and he did sound|very terrible.<br> I guess I really pulled the rug|out from under him.<br> Although his real crush is on Judy.<br> - Not to offend you, Gabe.|- I'm not.<br> I love it when someone likes Judy.<br> Gabe needs confirmation|of his feelings when it comes to me.<br> That's a terrible thing to say.<br> I'd watch it if I were you, Gabe.<br> He always talks about Judy|in hushed tones.<br> I think those poems you wrote|impressed him.<br> Here's to a good marriage.<br> - The best two people can hope for.|- Absolutely.<br> - I didn't know about the poetry.|- I didn't think you'd care.<br> - Well, why not?|- Because.<br> I'd be embarrassed|to show you my stuff.<br> - Why?|- You're so hard on everything.<br> What are you talking about?<br> - You're very, very judgmental.|- I like poetry.<br> I'm crazy about Shakespeare|and Byron and T.S. Eliot.<br> Well, my stuff isn't|quite that good yet.<br> - I'd give an objective evaluation.|- I don't want an objective evaluation.<br> I'd like something a little more|supportive and generous.<br> - From that character in your office?|- He's not a character.<br> - Are you in love with him?|- No! Why, because I show him my poems?<br> - I saw Dr. Ritchie today.|- Oh, where?<br> I went back into psychotherapy.<br> You don't need psychotherapy,|and certainly not with her!<br> Why? Because she's postmodern?<br> Anyone who thinks the Sabine women|had it coming to them...<br> That's not it.<br> - I don't flirt.|- Don't tell me that.<br> I've seen you do it.<br> You put on a different personality.<br> - You're crazy.|- You pretend to want things you don't.<br> - Like?|- Going to Europe.<br> That's flirting. You couldn't survive|off the island of Manhattan.<br> You misrepresented yourself to me.<br> What do you mean by that?<br> Like you had one child then|decided that was it.<br> - I'm not the same person I was.|- That's why relationships go sour.<br> - You hate change.|- Change equals death.<br> Bullshit. That's bullshit!<br> Maybe your students think it's|insightful, but it means nothing.<br> Life is made of change.<br> If you don't change,|you just shrivel up.<br> I don't want to.|You get sexual at the oddest times.<br> You use sex to express every|emotion but love.<br> You were attracted to me...<br> ...because in some way,|I reminded you of Harriet.<br> But I disappointed you|because I was too normal.<br> I liked you because|you were decent and not crazy.<br> - And you found that too boring.|- No...<br> ...as it turns out you were|as crazy as her.<br> - So I did remind you of Harriet.|- No...<br> ...I had a feeling you|were unstable.<br> On the surface you were...<br> ...but now that we're having problems,|you're not.<br> This is all very clear to me.<br> - We both couldn't sleep one night,|remember...<br> ...and we found Wild Strawberries|on cable...<br> ...we stayed up all night watching it?|That was great.<br> We were going to the faculty dinner|and we were on Fifth Avenue...<br> ...on an icy black night.|We were walking downtown.<br> Suddenly we decided not to go|to the dinner...<br> ...it was such a beautiful night.|We walked into Central Park.<br> You could see every star. You were|so beautiful in that black dress.<br> - Don't do that.|- Why not?<br> Because it's over and we both know it.<br> Do we?<br> All that stuff...|Those memories, they're just memories.<br> They're from years gone by.<br> They're isolated moments...<br> ...they don't tell the whole story.<br> Several days later,|Gabe moved into a hotel.<br> I wasn't being totally honest|with Gabe.<br> Because I didn't want to hurt him.|But I knew what I wanted.<br> I was in love with Michael.|I wanted to be free to...<br> ...pursue that and not have to lie|or sneak around or anything.<br> How could I be 100% honest with Judy?<br> I loved her|and I didn't want to hurt her.<br> What am I gonna say?<br> That I'm becoming infatuated|with a 20-year-old?<br> That I see myself sleepwalking|into a mess?<br> Then why didn't you stop yourself?<br> There was something in my marriage|that I was not getting. Rain...<br> - There was excitement there.|- Rain had a boyfriend.<br> I know. Everything about|it was wrong.<br> That did not deter me.<br> If anything, as usual,|there was something interesting.<br> So, what is it?|You have a self-destructive streak?<br> I don't know.|My heart...<br> ...does not know from logic.<br> Hello?<br> Oh, Michael, please.<br> I can't keep discussing this.<br> It was a decision I needed to make...|No. Wanted to make.<br> I said I'm sorry.|I can't keep discussing this.<br> No. I don't want to have a drink.|I have to go.<br> Well, you make it hard!|I have to go.<br> Later, Judy helped Michael get|over the loss of Sally.<br> Here we go.<br> - Heavens, Judy.|- Pretty good, huh?<br> That's mine, where's yours?<br> I am so happy that's not true.<br> Thanks.<br> Right, shall I be mum?|Cheers.<br> - It's a real treat.|- You're welcome.<br> - Where's your wife?|- We're not together anymore.<br> Oh, you writers.

I was born in a storm.<br> It's dangerous.<br> She looks great.<br> She's 21!|It's absolutely incredible.<br> - Our littler Rainer.|- I'm gonna be 55.<br> It's our 25th wedding|anniversary in June.<br> Don't worry.|We got some light in here for you.<br> I know I paid that bill.<br> Take some of these candles out there.<br> I can't believe this.|I know I had a flashlight.<br> Oh, this is just my luck on my own|birthday. It goes black.<br> You look very pretty in candlelight.<br> Oh, did you see the lightning flashes?<br> It's supposed to get worse. How's|everybody gonna get home now?<br> Happy birthday.<br> I didn't want to give it to|you in the other room because...<br> ...it could be misconstrued, so...<br> ...I've been hiding it in my jacket.|- Very nice.<br> That's lovely!<br> That is so pretty.<br> Happy birthday.<br> - Why would it be misconstrued?|- It would just look funny.<br> Because you have a boyfriend.<br> People wouldn't understand.<br> It wouldn't look funny at all.|It's beautiful.<br> - You know what I'd really like?|- What?<br> A nice birthday kiss.<br> - You want a birthday kiss?|- Yeah.<br> Happy birthday.<br> - That's all?|- I'm drunk. This is not funny.<br> What do you mean?|That was a birthday kiss.<br> You want me to stick|my tongue down your throat?<br> Come on, you know what I mean.<br> You got a boyfriend in the other room.<br> I know. It's not serious.|It isn't serious.<br> Listen, I can't even|have this conversation.<br> Not that I haven't thought about it.<br> I have, but it's just too crazy. L...<br> It's so disappointing.<br> It isn't disappointing.|You got a boyfriend.<br> You couldn't ask for a|more romantic moment.<br> I mean, it's my 21 st birthday, and...<br> ...we're in a storm,|the lights are out and there's...<br> ...the rain sweeping the skyline.|- Why do I hear...<br> ...$50,000 worth of psychotherapy...<br> ...dialing 911 now?|- It's magical. I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry. I've had a|little too much to drink too.<br> - Me too. I had...|- I'm just...<br> You want to kiss?|I mean, you want a real kiss?<br> You want an actual,|professional kiss?<br> - Yes.|- Both lips, upper and lower.<br> - At once?|- I've thought about it.<br> - I gotta tell you.|- Come here.<br> I was just hoping that lightning|can't come into a penthouse...<br> ...because it was tumultuous outside.|It was crashing all around and...<br> ...the scene had to be played.|I mean, I was...<br> ...I wanted to kiss her,|it was pouring...<br> ...but I figured,|any second the lightning...<br> ...would come right|into the apartment and...<br> ...and that I would die.<br> I don't want to spend Sunday together,|because I need time alone!<br> - Be alone! I'm not pushing you.|- Yes. Yes, you are, in that...<br> ...quiet, steady way of yours.|"Supportive," is your word.<br> "Understanding."|Stop being so understanding.<br> I still have feelings for Sally.<br> Feelings I don't think|I could ever have for you.<br> Oh, God! Where are you...?|Oh, for...<br> - I'm sorry.|- I never want to see you again!<br> - I need you.|- It's good to know how you feel.<br> I'm glad to know.<br> - You are so self-centered!|- I know.<br> I didn't mean those things.<br> - Why did you say them?|- I'm confused.<br> - I never want to hurt you.|- Bullshit!<br> It's not bullshit. I don't|deserve you. I'm sorry. Please!<br> - Did you shut the windows?|- I was thinking...<br> ...it's a good thing we fixed|that leak in the den.<br> Even now I'm still scared of thunder.|Any loud noise.<br> We would have been nuts to|use those theatre tickets.<br> We'd have been swerving all over.<br> - I'm glad we stayed home.|- Me too.<br> When we were apart,|this storm would have terrified me.<br> I was scared enough sleeping alone.<br> Sometimes you can be alone|when you're with someone.<br> Should we have given those|other tickets to Gabe or Judy?<br> - We did buy them for them.|- Yeah, I know, but...<br> ...the situation's|completely different now.<br> A year and a half later,|much had occurred.<br> Judy was married to Michael.<br> - So, you happy?|- Go ahead.<br> Yes, I think things have|gone pretty smoothly.<br> - He puts up with my idiosyncrasies.|- No, she puts up with mine.<br> She's passive-aggressive.|Somehow, she gets what she wants.<br> She wanted me, she wanted Gabe...<br> ...she wanted the job at the magazine,|out of her marriages...<br> ...she wants Michael...<br> I disagree.<br> When Sally went back to Jack,|I went after Judy.<br> Not at first, but when I|decided, I went after her.<br> Gee, I hope I didn't push.|I wanted it to work, it's true.<br> We're doing fine. Really.|We've learned to...<br> ...tolerate our problems more.|Don't you think?<br> I've learned, anyway, that love is...<br> ...not about passion and|romance necessarily.<br> It's also about companionship and...<br> ...it's like a buffer against|loneliness, I think.<br> That stuff is important.|Somebody to grow old with.<br> What kills most people is|unreal expectations.<br> What about things that|can't be talked about?<br> Like sexual problems, for instance.<br> - Unresolved.|- Unresolved?<br> Well, there's some things you|can't solve and then...<br> ...you have to live with it.<br> You construct some|kind of patchwork thing.<br> - But sometimes they flare up.|- They do, and when it happens...<br> ...it gets tough when that happens.<br> You learn to deal with it and then|push it under the rug.<br> And it works. That's the weird thing.|It's not bad.<br> You can't force yourself to|conform to some abstract...<br> ...vision of love, or...<br> ...you know, marriage.|Every situation's different.<br> Whatever works is the deal.<br> Ours is just one way.<br> It's funny. Last year when|we were at Gabe and Judy's...<br> ...and we announced so flippantly|we were splitting...<br> - I wasn't that confident.|- I wasn't either.<br> I remember thinking|they were so lucky.<br> They had such a great marriage.<br> It's ironic that we're|together and they aren't.<br> - Yeah.|- Weird.<br> I had a romantic moment...<br> ...with Rain at her|21 st birthday party...<br> ...and I could feel|the old pull coming back.<br> The old attraction coming back.|Feelings I'd had...<br> ...from my past.|It was very vivid to me.<br> That was a... That was a...<br> ...a great moment.|I don't really think we should...<br> ...follow up on it.<br> What do you...?|What do you mean?<br> Well, you know, I just...|If things were different...<br> If I was younger,|or if you were older...<br> ...or anything different,|but somehow...<br> ...I just feel I know how|this is gonna come out.<br> You sure?<br> I am. You know, I really am.<br> I knew how it would end.<br> And I left and I walked out|into the pouring rain.<br> I just headed instinctively|back to my apartment...<br> ...because I wanted to hold Judy|and kiss her...<br> ...and say things to her, and then...<br> ...then I realized that, you know,|I really blew it.<br> So, what's your life like now?<br> I'm out of the race for now.|I don't want to get involved.<br> I don't want to hurt anyone.|I don't want to get hurt.<br> I don't mind living by|myself and working.<br> It's temporary.<br> I'll have the urge to get back|into the swing of things.<br> That seems to be how it goes.<br> I'm writing, I'm working on a...<br> ...a new novel. Not the old|one anymore, and, um...<br> ...it's fine.|- Is it different?<br> My novel? Yes, it's less|confessional, more political.<br> Can I go? Is this over?<br>
