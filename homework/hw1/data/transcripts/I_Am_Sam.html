OK?<br> That's a month from now...<br> so I come back here<br> in one month with Lucy.<br> No, Mr. Dawson. You will have<br> monitored visits...<br> two times a week<br> for two hours.<br> And now we're moving on<br> to 4-D, Parker--<br> What do you mean?<br> You will see Lucy<br> two times a week for two hours.<br> Why isn't Lucy<br> going home with me?<br> I want her to go home with me.<br> Not today.<br> Thank you, Mr. Dawson.<br> Thank you.<br> Of course the judge<br> picked the lawyer.<br> For God's sake,<br> put it together.<br> She's the one who took<br> Lucy away from you...<br> so it's time that<br> you get your own lawyer now.<br> You guys think I'm guilty?<br> -No, Sam.<br> -You didn't kill anybody.<br> I miss Lucy, Sam.<br> Me, too.<br> You need<br> a personal injury lawyer...<br> because you have been<br> personally injured.<br> When Dustin Hoffman<br> was trying to keep Billy...<br> from going back<br> to Meryl Streep...<br> his lawyer told him that<br> it would cost him $15,000...<br> and that's if we win.<br> -$15,000!<br> -And that's if we win.<br> Don't worry about money, Sam.<br> Get the best.

I'm Sam.<br> Mr. Dawson. It's a pleasure.<br> Since somebody made a mistake...<br> unfortunately<br> we only have a little time.<br> Hold my calls<br> unless it's my kid.<br> That's a wonderful choice.<br> Can we get you something<br> to drink?<br> Is it for free?<br> -My treat.<br> -OK. Thank you.<br> Yeah, I would like<br> a glass of milk.<br> Did you get that, Patricia?<br> Yes.<br> And Lucy<br> had an ice cream cake...<br> with pink flowers--<br> not white--<br> and she likes<br> cherry vanilla because--<br> If that's Jake Hiller,<br> put him through.<br> Jake, no.<br> So I got cherry--<br> -Your son's on line two.<br> -Did you get that?<br> Tell him to hold<br> for just one second.<br> I have to go.

All right?<br> Isn't Lucy already<br> smarter than you?<br> You buried yourself.<br> You've got to do better.<br> I kind of think<br> we're the same smart.<br> What does that mean?<br> I know the bus routes<br> better than she does.<br> How does that make you<br> the same smart?<br> Doesn't every parent<br> want their kid to be smart?<br> That's true,<br> but the issue here is that...<br> at the age of seven,<br> Lucy is smarter than you.<br> But in some ways,<br> I'm smarter than she is.<br> You got to be firm on this.<br> In some ways, she's--<br> In some ways,<br> I'm smarter than her.<br> In some ways, I'm smarter<br> than you, Mr. Turner.<br> In some ways, I'm smarter<br> than you, Judge McNeilly.<br> Whoa.

Mint?<br> No, no. The blender exploded.<br> Look at me.<br> Slow down,<br> because Lucy needs you.<br> Yeah, Lucy needs me.<br> We need you, Ms. Harrison.<br> I go in there now,<br> because it's my turn.<br> Go sit.<br> How will you be able<br> to pay for private tutoring?<br> There's a free program<br> at the YWCA...<br> and Lucy can go to that program.<br> Don't you ever think<br> it would be better for Lucy...<br> if she lived with<br> a permanent foster family...<br> and you could visit<br> whenever you wanted?<br> No, I don't think<br> that's a very good idea, see.<br> Because the Fosters,<br> they don't know Lucy.<br> And I know Lucy<br> because I'm her father.<br> So, I think<br> if they want to see her...<br> then the Fosters can come over<br> to our house to visit her.<br> And I'm very firm on this.<br> I'm very firm on this idea,<br> because Lucy belongs with me.<br> Why?<br> Remember when Paul McCartney<br> wrote the song "Michelle"...<br> and then he only wrote<br> the first part, Annie said.<br> And then he gave<br> that part to John Lennon...<br> and he wrote the part<br> that said...<br> "I love you,<br> I love you, I love you."<br> Annie said<br> that it wouldn't have been...<br> the same song without that...<br> and that's why<br> the whole world cried...<br> when the Beatles broke up<br> on April 10, 1970.<br> No further questions.<br> So, your parents put you<br> in an institution.<br> My mother got sick, see...<br> so I had to go in<br> an institution...<br> when my mother got sick.<br> What about your father?<br> Where was he?<br> He was gone when I was born.<br> He went away when I was born.<br> So the people at the institution<br> were your parents.<br> Were they nice to you?<br> Some, yes. Some, no.<br> Did they hit you?<br> Sometimes they did hit me.<br> Yeah.<br> Like you hit Lucy's friend<br> at her birthday party?<br> Objection. Mistakes<br> the facts and evidence.<br> Nobody hit anybody.<br> I'll rephrase that.<br> Strong-armed.<br> So, who do you look up to?<br> Who do you want to be like...<br> as a father<br> when parenting Lucy?<br> The head of the institution?<br> The principal? The warden?<br> Not Mr. Whitehead. Not him.<br> Then who?<br> Who?<br> Myself.<br> I look up to myself as a father.<br> Mr. Dawson, you have<br> the capacity of a 7-year-old.<br> What makes you think you have<br> the ability to be a father?<br> Your background, your IQ...<br> your friends<br> who can't even testify--<br> Objection.<br> Compound questions.<br> -Objection!<br> -Sustained.<br> They love Lucy, see.<br> Even if Rita didn't think<br> they were smart enough...<br> to testify, they love Lucy.<br> Yeah.

Your Honor--<br> -Overruled.<br> What makes you think<br> you can raise a 7-year-old?<br> A 10-year-old? A 13-year-old?<br> You know what that means?<br> She'll be six years<br> more advanced than you.<br> What makes you think<br> you can do that?<br> What makes you think<br> you can do that?<br> What makes you think<br> you can do that?<br> I...<br> have had a lot<br> of time, see, to...<br> think about what it is...<br> that makes somebody<br> a good parent...<br> and it's about constancy...<br> and it's about...<br> patience,<br> and it's about listening...<br> and it's about<br> pretending to listen...<br> even when<br> you can't listen anymore.<br> And it's about love,<br> like she said.<br> See, Billy has a home with me...<br> and I made it the best I could.<br> And it's not perfect...<br> and I'm not a perfect parent...<br> and sometimes I don't have<br> enough patience...<br> and I forget<br> he's just a little kid...<br> but we built a life<br> together...<br> and we love each other.<br> And if you destroy that...<br> it'll be irre--irrep--<br> Let me see. Let me see.<br> -Irreparable.<br> -Yep!<br> Yes. Yes.<br> Joanne, don't do that, please.<br> Don't do it twice.<br> Not to him.<br> Meryl Streep can't even look<br> at Dustin Hoffman after that.<br> "Kramer vs. Kramer."<br> Thank you, Mr. Wali,<br> for that commentary.<br> Your Honor, my client<br> is understandably upset.<br> Motion to recess.<br> I don't exactly<br> like recess very much.<br> Motion denied.<br> Continue with your witness,<br> Mr. Turner.<br> Mr. Dawson...it's hard.<br> I know it's hard to know what<br> to say to Lucy half the time.<br> Right? ls it?<br> No.<br> No?

You don't know...<br> what it takes<br> to raise your daughter.<br> Objection.<br> These are not questions.<br> This is an attack.<br> Overruled.<br> I'm Lucy's father.<br> -I'm her father.<br> -Are you really?<br> I'm not talking<br> about the fact...<br> that you got<br> some homeless woman pregnant.<br> Objection, Your Honor!<br> Get to the question, Mr. Turner.<br> The question is,<br> if you love your daughter...<br> as much as you say you do--<br> and I know that you do--<br> don't you think<br> she deserves more?<br> Don't you<br> in your heart of hearts...<br> secretly question yourself<br> every day?<br> Objection. Compound questions.<br> OK, yeah!<br> I'm sorry. Was that a yes?<br> I think<br> Lucy deserves everything.<br> In my heart of hearts,<br> I think she deserves everything.<br> Yes, she does.<br> -Yeah, OK.<br> -Yes, she does.<br> And you agree<br> with everyone here...<br> that you can't give her that.<br> Maybe everybody's right, see.<br> Maybe everybody's right<br> about that, see.<br> So no more now, OK?<br> No more now.

That's it! I've had it!<br> Sam, can I come in?<br> Not really room here.<br> There's no room here.<br> Yeah, well, I lived<br> in the East Village.<br> I don't need a lot of room.<br> Because I make things--<br> everything is too hard<br> on everybody.<br> I make everything hard<br> on everybody.<br> I can go...<br> at least another nine rounds.<br> But you gotta let me in.<br> Please. Sam.<br> There you are.<br> Now I can see those kind eyes.<br> So, George says that<br> you needed a break from work.<br> I don't really want<br> to work there anymore...<br> because there's too many people.<br> Then maybe we can find you<br> a quieter job, because--<br> Remember that was one of<br> the judge's conditions...<br> that you earn more money.<br> You have to keep<br> earning more money...<br> so that you can<br> get a new apartment...<br> and Lucy can have<br> her own room...<br> for when you get her back.<br> Yeah, except that<br> Lucy doesn't need me anymore.<br> She has a new family now...<br> and she doesn't need me anymore.<br> Is that what she said?<br> It's because I know that.<br> Because I just know that.<br> Well.<br> That's the first stupid thing<br> I've ever heard you say.<br> Sam, you can get Lucy back.<br> The court favors reunification.<br> But, Sam,<br> you have to fight for her.<br> Yeah, but I tried!<br> I tried hard!<br> -Try harder!<br> -Yeah, but you don't know!<br> I don't know what?<br> You don't know<br> what it's like when you try...<br> and you try and you try<br> and you don't ever get there!<br> Because you were born perfect,<br> and I was born like this!<br> And you're perfect!<br> Is that right?<br> -People like you don't know.<br> -People like me?<br> You don't know what it's like<br> to get hurted...<br> because you don't have feelings.<br> People like you<br> don't feel anything.<br> You think you got the market<br> cornered on human suffering?<br> Let me tell you something<br> about people like me.<br> People like me feel lost<br> and little and ugly...<br> and dispensable.<br> People like me have husbands...<br> screwing someone else<br> far more perfect than me.<br> People like me<br> have sons who hate them.<br> And I've screamed<br> horrible things to him...<br> a seven-year-old,<br> because he doesn't want...<br> to get in the car<br> at the end of the day.<br> And then he looks at me<br> with such anger...<br> and I hate him then.<br> I know I'm failing you.<br> I know I'm disappointing you.<br> I know you deserve better,<br> but get in the fucking car!<br> Every morning,<br> I wake up and I fail.<br> And I look around, and everybody<br> seems to be pulling it off...<br> but somehow I can't...<br> no matter how hard I try.<br> Somehow...l'll never be enough.<br> You're enough.<br> Yeah, you're much more<br> than enough.<br> Lovely Rita.<br> Get off the grass, Dino.<br> OK, come on.<br> Be careful,<br> because you're gonna get hurt.<br> Guys, be careful<br> of the pictures.<br> Be careful<br> of the pretty pictures.<br> Sam, you're early.<br> All the lights were green.<br> When I was walking here,<br> all the lights were green.<br> There's a reason<br> for the court schedule.<br> You stopped showing up.<br> Lucy's had to rebuild<br> her whole life, Sam.<br> I want her back.<br> I know I can get her back.<br> That's not up to me.<br> But I'm just gonna tell you...<br> I'm gonna do everything<br> in my power...<br> to protect that little girl<br> from getting hurt again.<br> Whose dogs are these?<br> These are supplemental income.<br> Because I wash and I walk<br> and I feed the dogs.<br> Sam Dawson has everything<br> for your canine needs.<br> Let me go get your daughter.<br> Everybody behave<br> like a gentleman...<br> because Lucy's<br> gonna come out here...<br> and first impressions<br> are very important.<br> You never even came!<br> You never called!<br> You forgot about me!<br> How could you forget me?<br> No, I didn't forget you!<br> I would never forget you!<br> I hate you!<br> Will you not be mad at me<br> for one second?<br> Because I want to<br> tell you one thing, OK?<br> Because last night,<br> I was writing you a letter...<br> and then the words,<br> they got too big.<br> Gesundheit, Floppy.<br> Floppy has a cold.<br> And then I said...<br> "Dear Lucy, I'm sorry<br> I maybe hurt your feelings...<br> "and I was thinking<br> about you all the time.<br> "Lucy on a hammock...<br> "and Lucy at school...<br> "and Lucy in the sky<br> and kisses and hugs, Daddy.<br> "And P.S. I love you,<br> like the song.<br> "P.S. I love you,<br> like in the song."<br> Hello, Mr. Dawson.<br> Yeah. Hello, lawyer.<br> Shall we?<br> And in these next months...<br> Mr. Dawson will be expanding<br> his support system...<br> to include regional service<br> programs, tutors, and--<br> I think it's very important<br> that you know...<br> that the foster family is<br> pushing forward toward adoption.<br> The Department of Child<br> and Family Services and l...<br> fully support their request.<br> Darn it.<br> Sam, there's one option<br> we've never talked about.<br> I know what you went through...<br> the last time<br> you took the stand.<br> I didn't like that at all.<br> We could give the foster parents<br> guardianship...<br> and then we could try...<br> for the most incredible<br> visitation rights...<br> and it would almost seem<br> like joint custody.<br> You're saying<br> I don't have a chance.<br> That's what you're saying.<br> No. I'm not saying<br> you don't have a chance.<br> That's what you said last time<br> and now look where he is.<br> But she's not saying<br> that I don't have a chance.<br> So tell me that I have a chance.<br> Oh, my God. Sam, you guys...<br> it's video night at my house,<br> and I'm not even there.<br> -Check.<br> -Sam, get your dessert to go.<br> Because, OK.<br> Wait.<br> This is really hard to say.<br> For me, this is<br> a very hard thing to say...<br> but I'm gonna stay and have<br> my dessert here with Rita...<br> and I'm not gonna go<br> to video night tonight.<br> What?<br> Gee, that figures.<br> I knew that was coming.<br> Sam, you can go if you--<br> -I said no, Rita.<br> -But if you want to go--<br> Do you want me to go?<br> No, I don't want you to go,<br> but you can go if you want.<br> -Fine.<br> -Fine.<br> Good-bye, Rita.<br> If you want to come to<br> video night, you're welcome to.<br> Thank you, Joe.<br> Bye, Joe.<br> Because you're eating slower.<br> That's good.<br> Because it's good to chew.<br> Buttermilk pancakes.<br> OK. Let me see.<br> OK, sidebar.<br> Because you--<br> you need to leave your husband.<br> And I need to get Lucy back.<br> We need--<br> When dealing with the customer,<br> always be friendly...<br> and not familiar.<br> Because I can be your friend.<br> Thank you.<br> But you still need<br> to leave your husband.<br> My marriage isn't so bad.<br> It's just that...<br> it's just...<br> I've never lost at anything.<br> -Daddy?<br> -Hi.<br> What are you doing here?<br> I live here.<br> What do you mean you live here?<br> Actually, I live here.<br> This is where you live?<br> So close to me?<br> Yeah, because I wanted<br> to be close.<br> I wanted to be closer to you...<br> so I live here<br> in that apartment.<br> It's number nine.<br> And number nine<br> is like October 9...<br> when John Lennon was born...<br> and his son was born<br> on October 9, too.<br> John met Yoko on November 9.<br> Yeah, and his mother lived...<br> at number nine Newcastle<br> in Liverpool.<br> Newcastle, nine letters.<br> Liverpool, nine letters.<br> Maybe I can talk to Daddy<br> for a minute?<br> Come over here, Dino.<br> You're a Girl Scout now!<br> Is that OK?<br> Yeah, that's really good.<br> Look at my pins.<br> -It looks very good on you.<br> -Thank you.<br> You'll be<br> a very good Girl Scout.<br> Sam, we need to talk.<br> What are you doing?<br> Trying to get closer to her<br> by moving closer?<br> We're supposed<br> to give her consistency.<br> We've got a week<br> till we go to court.<br> Because every time I came down<br> to see her on a bus...<br> I was always every time<br> wasting time on a bus.<br> I really do understand.<br> But we have to make it about her<br> and what's best for her.<br> Yeah, what's best for her<br> is what's most important.<br> -Right.<br> -Yeah.<br> Does Floppy still have his cold?<br> Yeah, but Floppy's<br> getting much better.<br> That's good.<br> Can I buy some cookies from you?<br> That'll be 3.25.<br> We can get it<br> from you later.<br> We really should get going.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thank you.<br> Can I hug her bye-bye?<br> Of course you can hug her.<br> Good-bye.<br> Really very good to see you.<br> Daddy!<br> Did you know<br> that Warren G. Harding...<br> was the 29th president<br> of the United States?<br> Remember, the 29th president...<br> in case the judge asks.<br> What are you doing out here?<br> I missed you.<br> You could get really hurted.<br> And it's really cold...<br> and you don't have enough on<br> to keep you warm.<br> What--?<br> She couldn't sleep,<br> so she came to my house.<br> Give me my daughter.<br> Give us Lucy. Come here.<br> Easy, Sam.<br> Thank you.<br> Sometimes<br> if you rub her belly...<br> and then if you<br> tell her two stories...<br> and give her half<br> an IHOP corn muffin...<br> then sometimes she sleeps.<br> When she can't sleep.<br> We'll be fine, Sam.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> You can go home now.<br> Yeah, a personal<br> pepperoni pan pizza.<br> That's a wonderful choice.<br> Daddy?<br> Daddy?<br> Lucy, come here.<br> Hi, sweetie.<br> I made us a midnight snack.<br> Half an IHOP corn cake.<br> I understand that<br> you want to see your daddy.<br> And I really don't want<br> to keep you from him.<br> I really honestly don't.<br> I want you to know that.<br> So whenever you want<br> to see him, you just tell me.<br> Any time you want<br> to see him is fine...<br> but we kind of need<br> to work it out first.<br> So how about a snack?<br> Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Good night.<br> Everybody behave yourself.<br> Oh, how wonderful.<br> You brought Willy.<br> -Hi, Willy.<br> -Hi, Sam.<br> It's good to see you.<br> We have to close the door<br> because the dogs go out.<br> My husband left this<br> when he moved out.<br> Lovely Rita.<br> OK, let me see.<br> They're going to put Randy<br> on the stand tomorrow first...<br> and then you.<br> They're a very nice couple.<br> And she's pretty,<br> and they have a nice house...<br> and she's smart, too.<br> Sam, I worry.<br> I worry sometimes.<br> Do you worry<br> that you did something wrong?<br> I worry that I've gotten...<br> more out of this relationship<br> than you.<br> I have the lawyer<br> that never loses.<br> That's me.<br> And the manager at<br> the Pizza Hut's gonna testify...<br> and that's good.<br> Absolutely.<br> And Annie said<br> that George thinks--<br> that George Harrison<br> couldn't--<br> maybe, he couldn't<br> write a song...<br> but then he wrote<br> "Here Comes the Sun"...<br> and she said that it was one of<br> the best songs on "Abbey Road."<br> George was always<br> my favorite Beatle.<br> She's OK. Sorry.<br> She fell asleep in the car.<br> I was gonna turn back<br> and tuck her in...in her room.<br> You know, that l--<br> in her room that I made for her.<br> Because I tried to make<br> a really nice room for her.<br> But I was afraid<br> she'd wake up at our house...<br> and want to come home.<br> That's a girl.<br> I have to apologize to you...<br> because I was gonna<br> tell that judge...<br> that I could give Lucy<br> the kind of love she never had.<br> But I can't say that,<br> because I'd be lying.<br> I hope...<br> I hope you're saying<br> what I think you're saying.<br> I hope you're saying<br> what I think you're saying.<br> I am.<br> Bye.<br> I'll see you in court tomorrow.<br> Save me a seat, Sam.<br> On your side. OK?<br> Yeah. I'll save you a seat<br> on my side.<br> -Bye.<br> -Bye.<br> Randy?<br> If I tell you a secret...<br> that I can't do it by myself...<br> will you tell the judge on me?<br> No, Sam.<br> Promise?<br> I promise.<br> Because I always wanted<br> Lucy to have a mother.<br> I always wanted her<br> to have a mother.<br> Help. I need somebody.<br> Help. Not just anyone.<br> And you're the red<br> in her painting.<br> Because I think<br> you're the red in her painting.<br> Thank you, Sam.<br> Play ball!<br> Get it, Lucy!<br> Go, Lucy!<br> Lucy got a goal!<br> Lucy got a goal, Rita!<br>
